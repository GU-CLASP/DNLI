A	that's why we have things like planning permission which
B	yeah
A	oh those ducks look so sweet bobbing up and down
B	ah cos we don't rarely very often open the curtains in the snug but I had them open during the rugby and so straightaway he got up to have a look out and his little eyes
A	ah
B	were so bright
A	yes he's
B	his little chin
A	mm
A	liking the film we were watching when it
B	yes
A	had the rats on it
B	yes
A	he got quite into it at that point
B	yes mm
B	well they're not seeing what we are seeing but he's seeing small things
A	yeah
B	moving quickly which is
A	yeah
B	like a scurrying creature
A	mm
B	it's not the best beer but erm
A	I'm enjoying it
B	it's Greene King so this must be a Greene King pub
A	it's very nice to see the Thames properly and London properly like this I do think you see London better from the point of view of the Thames you really get a sense of the history
B	we should take a picture of the pub and we'll send it to
A	well I mean this is something that we should bear in mind for meeting
B	dunno probably flock but it might not be
A	oh of course it is but that's when they're flying isn't it? no no it's really I seem to
B	yes there it is darling
A	there it is it's going to
B	okay let's crack on
A	yeah let me finish my half pint are you
B	it's a bit cold
A	refreshed?
B	yes but cold I want to get
A	are you cold? I'm not cold at all
B	only because that cold beer made me cold
A	I'm trying to get it down me quickly
B	well it's on that list I read
A	where was it?
B	er er it's on the peninsula
A	okay so just as we are going er turning round then is that past the
B	I don't know
A	do you think
B	no
A	it wouldn't?
B	I don't mind you not wanting to go abroad
A	according to everybody you must be terribly missing out
B	well I suppose did you pick up your phone?
A	the attitude that people have is that my god they feel sorry for me cos I don't like travel
B	they feel more sorry for me
A	I think yeah
B	cos I'm denied
A	yeah
B	almost like
A	exactly
B	having an evil step
A	yeah
B	mother
A	erm exactly
A	exactly
A	thank you exactly that's how it feels cos that's how I'm being made to feel and hence also being blamed that you you're not going away but I'm not stopping you going away but I see what you mean you don't go unless I go cos you love me and hence everybody knows that you're not going because I'm not
B	going to Greece I might go to Greece this year and I might actually take you
A	Greece
B	this yeah
A	yeah
B	but now it would be sort of summery so you'd be terribly worried
A	no I
B	you can if you stay indoors
A	no the thing is I mean on paper yes but in reality? mm
B	like when we went on a we went on a tour of this historic
A	yeah
B	it was over forty degrees
A	oh fuck
A	well
A	it I mean
B	that's gonna kill you
A	well I mean yes but it would
B	he was not happy
A	it is gonna kill you it's gonna give you bloody skin cancer I mean
B	that's what mummy's got it now
A	I mean and hello your mum's got it sorry but that's why
B	that's
A	do anything about it cos you can't just say to people erm
B	I would erm
A	erm
B	manage I would manage
A	I'm burning I'm burning here do you mind if I erm just go away and very quickly find some shade?
B	the thing is in actual
A	no
B	fact if we just went out for a week all mum and auntie
A	yeah
B	so you could just sit indoors reading and
A	very hard to
B	sipping beer
A	actually manage it in reality
B	and then
A	I find
B	no because they're just pottering around you'd be under pressure to go to the
A	mm
B	so then you've just got to erm
A	mm it's not just that
B	to cope with
A	it's the walks between places where people aren't
B	then you've just got to
A	bothered about the sun and stuff where I am
B	then you've just got to cope
A	yeah
B	and back
A	that's what I'm saying
B	but potentially of course
A	but that's that's potentially very
B	potentially you could get
A	damaging
B	dropped off in the car then picked up
A	mm
B	gosh we'd manage you
A	I don't know it's really hard and especially when
B	and darling we could put you in a swimming costume one of those like an actual wetsuit so
A	yeah
B	like an
A	well erm I think the Japanese have invented something that goes completely over your face and it's like
A	a baraclava a balaclava but it's erm for sun
B	well you won't get much more industrial landscape than this dear
A	it's cool oh it's not actually I want to be
B	that way
A	that's a con
B	we're near enough
A	they said it was a Thames walk
B	I think we're near enough
A	we're not near enough
B	take my arm dear I'm sleepy
A	that's the beer
B	yeah it must be
A	we're not near enough can't call it Thames walk and then make you walk how many metres away from it are we
B	twenty
B	oh you'd be terrible at that darling
A	and you have to put them order yeah but the thing is
B	uhu
A	it wouldn't be as difficult if they hadn't changed yards into
B	that would be difficult
A	and yeah it thank you it is difficult and especially if you well no we're we're er of the age where we had both so I mean we're supposed to know but I'm more in the ounces world than the grams world I must admit
B	I'm more grams
A	are you? yeah?
B	five hundred grams
A	cos er you're that much younger than me you see
B	half a pound ish
A	but I'm now moving into grams more obviously cos things tend to be grams now
B	darling at least you don't get asked how much is a cup and a half
A	oh for fuck's sake how on earth do you get your head around that one?
A	I've rejected all books that are measured in cups I'm sorry I'm not there's enough to deal with in life without fucking cups it's not like a cup is a cup a cup is a cup if it's a liquid a cup if it's flour a cup if it's something else how fucking ridiculous is that? just have one bloody weight please
A	or one weight for liquid and one weight for which is the British millilitres or
B	millilitres
A	hold on though is the weight?
B	a fluid ounce you get
A	yeah so it's the same it's an ounce or it's a fluid ounce but it's the same if you were no is it the same?
B	what? not by volume no
A	oh
B	I love these little
A	is it cos it's a lot heavier?
B	well some things are oil would be heavier than water cos it's
A	oh there are so many things in life to learn I don't mind learning it it's just it's never done is it?
B	look darling it's a little miniature railway
A	yes sweet
B	gosh look you can see look at all the cement that falls off
A	yes
B	in those big piles they look like termite mounds
A	we're looking at another for the benefit of the recording
B	oh darling
B	it annoys me we're not
A	no I know
A	we I'm just being funny and going
B	look
A	we're looking at another thingamajig
B	look
A	oh look at that one
B	there's so much spillage darling it's created a little sandbank
A	yeah
B	that will be the wind the wind blowing it off onto this pathway
A	yeah I don't know what
B	yeah I was thinking earlier on
A	he's gonna go off on a
B	A he would quite like to explore
A	awol
B	that factory we've just been past
B	and B this is well outside his normal roaming territory
A	it is if he lived here he'd quite enjoy it and he would enjoy looking at the ducks
B	I think you're a bit tipsy
A	yes
B	look darling here's a little er erm shipyard there's little sailing boats that would be pretty
A	I wish people would use their bells you nearly got run over then
B	I know you worry about me would have punched the living daylights into him and then thrown his bike into the Thames would you have reported me to the police?
B	no beating him senseless and then throwing his bike in the Thames had he struck you for instance
B	I would have been merciless
B	in my
A	ah
B	ah this the yacht club so there is a pub called The Yacht or at least a bar but it might be this place here
A	yeah
B	oh look at this
A	we've done very well it's only two and a quarter miles to the Cutty Sark now
B	didn't is that the one that burnt down?
A	erm I think it has a couple of times hasn't it?
B	well that's like the philosophical question about the broom
A	well the it's the broom is a broom still a broom if you replace the end of it and then you replace the handle?
B	is it the same broom?
A	is it the same broom?
B	the other philosophical
A	or is a girl band still a girl band
B	it's like that
A	if you keep replacing the members?
B	but the other philosophical question is
A	oh
B	which should we go darling? right
B	is this a ship sets out
A	no
B	cos normally you'd say yes
A	well oh god it's a really philosophical question though
B	but then oh but there's a secondary part of the question this is there's another ship that follows the first ship and every bit of wood they discard they cobble together to make a boat
A	is the ship?
B	is the ship that left? the so so when does? this that should be a little er
A	yeah
B	bar the yacht club there
A	yeah it probably is
B	oh there's an old man that sails darling sweet he's not that old
A	he's not he's young
B	he's older than me
A	he's about the same age I think
B	look there's a bit of sculpture
A	oh yes
B	is there
A	yeah it doesn't look very public
B	well but there is The Yacht
A	well it I don't know that would say The Yacht though wouldn't it?
B	it would make it more obvious yes
A	yeah
B	maybe it was up that bit
A	I wonder if
B	probably yes
A	there's something up there something riverside
B	I still get her email I'm back
A	yeah I do as well
B	or I get her text and I always reply thanks god
A	yes
B	platinum
A	riverside
B	riverside they're gross they we'll have to look we've almost at the er
A	the Dome
B	we're not though cos I think it just doubles right back and then comes right
A	do you think that's an illusion?
B	yeah I think so
A	I've never actually been to the Dome
B	I went to the
A	I've been past it many times
B	I've been once to go to the Brits launch party
A	to think they were just gonna build it and then knock it down again I mean how ridiculous is that?
B	little activity centre
A	oh sweet
B	ecology park
A	yes there it is look
B	nice
A	yes
B	look both ways so actually we could have walked all the way round that maybe
A	it's quite sweet
B	it's just basically
A	it there's lots of wildlife in there
B	loud industrial noises aren't there?
A	yeah
B	is it?
A	what is
B	dull isn't
A	customer centre for the flats
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	instead
A	between council flats and those
B	no
A	this is what always
B	and instead of the riverside
A	kind of makes me quite
B	the riverside used lovely er bricks throughout
A	no they've done
B	amazing
A	a good job
B	but it's
A	definitely
B	it's alright certainly not an eyesore
A	yeah
B	it's cold
A	it's colder than it was
B	I'm now glad I'm wearing a woolly hat
A	yeah
B	cos having previously gone gone through a period of thinking maybe I didn't need one
A	yeah
B	very glad I have
A	yep
B	yeah
A	yep all strange
B	what is it good for?
A	dumped in?
A	oh is that
B	yeah
A	oh my god
B	that you did not enjoy and you were like a
A	oh my god
A	well you see that is my perfect example
B	you wanted to watch telly
A	yeah I did wanna watch telly what the fuck's wrong with that? it's a fucking holiday I don't wanna bloody
B	the
A	wanna bloody
B	that's just weird
A	break my back on a holiday
B	no
A	so there you go you can't so
A	to just go in the first place is a compromise cos you're gonna end up having to do stuff you don't want to do I mean actually stuff that's probably bad for you in fact cos if you're meant to pace yourself because of your energy levels and all sorts for example if you've got ME or something
B	so look darling
A	hold on the peninsula we've lost the Millennium Dome that's odd
B	straight ahead
A	oh there it is
B	they look like cranes
A	so are we gonna see the peninsula going to the?
B	it's also the
A	hold on are we gonna go that way? there's a pier there the
A	that's the what pier is that Greenwich? no north
A	no North Greenwich I think Millennium Dome yeah
B	no North Greenwich is north of the river
A	oh
B	isn't it?
A	can't remember the name of the pier
B	maybe not actually no you're right it is this side of the water actually
A	well north of the main Greenwich presumably they're talking about
B	yeah
A	look there's a sculpture
B	yes I mentioned that already
A	oh
B	look at the lovely weed bank that's growing here
A	yeah
B	that looks
A	very nice there's er lots of information here
B	got to be safe
A	safe from what?
B	darling
A	yeah I don't think I want to go back yet
B	well we'll probably end up having a drink and supper
A	but I wonder where we'll end up how far would we make it I wonder? suppose if we carried on and carried on we'd end up at Bankside
B	could this be if I wanted to save a hundred and seventy-six pounds a month
A	yeah
B	and commuted to work by doing this walk
A	yeah
B	and I'd have to get up at sort of half past four
A	hold on though if you cycled how would you? you'd go along here to where? and then you'd you could go across the Millennium Bridge
B	look here's this stupid thing
A	that nobody uses
B	I don't think these
A	no it would be pretty exhausting but you could
B	I'd love to climb that ladder
A	you'd probably spend the money on food that you'd need for the energy the money you'd save up to
B	one seven six well it's probably gone up actually it's maybe one eighty now
A	yeah
A	yeah
A	er
B	it's nice and warm and secure
A	I know later on
B	couples like walking don't they?
A	yes
B	it's mainly couples
A	ah
B	oh there's something called the Meantime Beer Box
A	where? is that a pub?
B	yeah Meantime
A	where?
B	we should go there it might be quite fun
A	yeah where is it though? I can't see it
B	it's in that behind those buildings there
A	oh not along the path?
B	in fact I remember we once we once erm walked past it when we got dropped off by
A	yes that was I remember seeing that
B	yeah what's
A	where is the next pub? I'm getting tired
B	it's funny though if you think how long we've been walking yet when we jump in the car with granny you know we're we're only just beyond
A	yeah but it's a different world not driving
B	it's a different world
A	it's a different reality
B	a different reality
A	and your mum is firmly in the reality of driving
B	look here's the Dome then darling we've never been there
A	and so many people are
B	be the closest you've ever been
A	and they only know the reality of driving
B	darling?
A	yeah it is
B	yeah there it is
A	I do not like that I don't want to
B	it'll be there
A	is it? I thought I saw
B	can you see the little tower?
A	yeah
B	erm
A	or am I thinking of someone else?
B	could well be Anish Kapoor sponsored by Mittal with the erm the metal
A	no stop it
B	what went wrong there?
A	I had decided I did not want to do that and you grabbed it anyway
B	do you get a lot of arguments you have to transcribe?
A	er littles ones
B	like that?
A	yeah
B	mainly is it girls telling off boys?
A	erm yeah
B	that was sort of an observation you could have made
B	no it's not mainly
A	that was actually quite hard to do
B	I can hear a gig darling
A	but there was one thing I
B	can you hear the gig?
A	there was also something and I forgot to put it in oh yeah the use really? really?
B	are we looking at the back stage area?
A	it sounds like Dolly Parton
B	what's that
A	the green room
B	there's Canary Wharf darling
A	oh look
A	the beacon of hope I want a pub
B	well do you want to start thinking about doubling back via the Meantime glass box?
A	no cos that's horrible really it's just on that big road
B	yeah but then the bus takes us home outside
A	oh no horrible
B	sorry darling
A	don't wanna ruin it like that
A	yeah I'd rather have a boat get a boat
B	all the people in the roof darling look
A	oh yeah
B	are they supposed to be there darling?
A	yeah
B	a big curve in the river isn't it? what are they doing?
A	there's a walkway I think they're walking on it
B	when I was a little boy I went on a fifty mile walk had to get up at about three AM
A	oh
B	didn't get back till midnight
A	oh my god
B	there they are it's very steep
A	they must be abseiling down that surely
B	yeah no look they're starting to make their way down they must be roped
A	yeah
B	very gingerly
A	right I think one more sit down and then we have a little think about what we do next so next pub we sit down
B	stop it am I allowed to do that?
A	well you are aren't you darling?
B	oh dear
A	yes you are you are allowed getting tired
B	and grouchy
A	no I'm not grouchy the river's very nice but I want a boat back not erm a horrible bus ride
B	oh look at that darling
A	it is a bit odd walking along with
A	careful
B	dunno can't be very good for your erm hips I can see a bar look at that darling
A	is that a hotel or something?
B	a hotel bar isn't it I'm not sure
A	mm
B	it's open yet though
A	ballroom
B	what's it called?
A	something
B	Arora
A	yeah
B	sorry darling
A	mm
B	look it's like having
A	yeah so er I see we're
B	and then we double back for miles
A	and then
B	windy
A	yep
B	that's one of the words we were looking for
A	well I was looking for another word for windy
B	well windy is
A	you said meandering but I don't think that's very descriptive
B	I think windy is best one so far
A	too much like windy
B	they're spelt the same
A	I think it is spelt the same
B	that's it winding
B	what on earth is that thing?
A	oh fuck there's no sign of a pub anywhere oh my god
B	well the hotel's clearly open I wonder why no one's in the bar that's where I would be
B	yes
A	oh this is far too far away from the bloody Thames
B	well it's all being developed
A	yeah well developed into what?
B	er hotels
A	yeah crap
B	oh look it is a country and western festival he's wearing a Stetson
A	yeah I think that was probably
A	Dolly Parton
B	oh
A	mm
B	oh and she's wearing cowboy boots
A	ah they're having fun
B	yes how they met
A	yes look there's the DLR there
B	really? yeah
A	but there's well
B	in North Greenwich
A	mm
B	okay darling
A	that's where we get a bus from then it's good to know doesn't look like there's anything
A	I need the loo
B	when you when you play the O2 darling that's where we'll they'll drop you off
A	yeah
A	I mean it's sterile personally in my opinion
B	it's
A	if you're gonna build something you'd I mean
B	it's also a boring bit of the walk
A	yeah completely
B	there VIP walk
A	I'm not inspired
A	when am I gonna be inspired again?
B	get the
A	don't know
B	that's what that big net was it's a fucking golf driving range
A	I went to a driving range once with my parents they were going to get into golf at one point but
B	I cannot imagine them
A	yeah well no the thing is it kind of fits their sort of erm
B	right darling what are we doing?
A	I don't know what's that over there?
B	is that the end of our walk? or do we carry on going up?
A	I wanted to go to one more place
B	well there's the Meantime Box
A	no that's not a place
B	why is it not a place?
A	it's only a place for the beer it's not a place though
B	well then define what you meant by one more place
A	by the river
A	somewhere pretty and nice
B	look there's an Irish dancing festival
A	not a thing
B	well that's why you've got to make a decision
A	mm where does this bus stop go to?
B	it's not a bus stop I think it's more of a shuttle service is it?
A	dunno
B	probably
A	oh
B	don't know darling anyway I can't even see the Thames
A	no
B	except just look oh that's the Blackwall Tunnel that's the erm I recognise that archway dear
A	which means what? we
B	nothing
A	could go to
B	we can't walk in the tunnel
A	oh fuck this is really boring
B	don't know darling
A	there it's probably an industrial thing
B	what?
A	it's got a green sign on it no oh I just wanted to go to one more place
B	for a golf range and a car park
A	it's not a place
B	where we can go to the loo and
A	I mean is it even open?
B	yep
A	oh for fuck's sake it's got really boring
B	well now we know darling
A	yeah at the O2 it gets shit
B	to the Thames Path
A	yeah well that doesn't look like the Thames Path it looks like away from the Thames Path
B	you'll end up
A	I do want to have a sit down and a loo break so we will have to we might have to go to the box
B	no?
A	no got disappointed now I wanted to go to another nice place before we go home well if we head back to
B	we're not too far from the glass box now
A	oh how far?
B	might as well see if we can reach it and then
A	okay
B	and if we can't find it then we'll
A	look how long I want to know though how long before we'd get back to a nice walk by the Thames if you reach this point?
B	come from there because it's such a
A	well maybe you need to start it from here and get a bus from here
B	what does that building say that's just down there up ahead in the red?
A	Emirates
B	oh that's the hub that's the hub for the er so we've just done a big circle really cos we were there about an hour ago
A	do not want to be walking along main roads though and now I'm knackered need food as well
