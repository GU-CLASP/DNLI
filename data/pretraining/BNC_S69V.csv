A	has a positive response from all the statutory consultees
B	mm
A	so we phoned
B	mm
A	and said
B	mm
A	so we took that to the Advertising Standards Authority
B	mm
A	and then of course he hit back at us when
C	but that didn't cost money did it?
A	it didn't it it
C	it just cost reputation not money
A	no it didn't it didn't cost us any money it just diverted us and took hundreds of hours to respond to it
C	mm
A	that was the issue
C	time
B	yeah it's a lot of it is time isn't it?
A	yeah oh it's time
B	yeah
A	mm
C	oh I didn't hear that question
A	yeah oh yeah
B	he did yeah he did
A	do you remember?
B	mm
A	did the twenty-seven thousand pounds include erm you know
C	well it would be
A	because you didn't
C	three hundred and twenty-seven thousand pounds if we had said them
A	well it was it was hundreds and of hours
B	yeah
A	hundreds of hours
B	oh
C	and time off work I took off unpaid
A	that's right
C	to appear at the
A	yeah that's
C	hearing other people are
A	yeah
C	probably the same
A	that's right
C	anyway would you like erm some sponge cake or some fruit cake which do you prefer?
A	I'll have the sponge cake please
C	or do you want both?
A	well I'll try the sponge cake to start with
C	okay
B	what are the choices?
C	fruit and sponge
B	erm
C	yeah
A	a Lidl?
B	a Lidl
A	oh I
B	oh
A	yeah
B	and that can was kicked down the road for months wasn't it?
A	yeah
B	wasn't it happened in January that and it was they were looking for a date in May was it was that right?
A	April the yeah they were trying to get a date April May
B	yeah
A	erm
B	was it because of what we found or and they didn't have the figures?
C	er sorry I wasn't listening
B	when when you know there was a bit hiatus a
C	well one issue was that
C	the whole report had to be rewritten the initial planners do you remember? that was a very early on
B	yeah
B	yeah
C	is that what you're not talking about that?
A	no we're erm we're talking about the
B	oh
A	development control committee
B	mm
A	the the development control committee meeting was put off
B	mm
A	it was scheduled for a February
B	mm
A	and
B	mm
A	and the day before the DCC meeting
B	mm
A	and demanded to know and that's when it was adjourned for a month then but that was the DCC meeting rather than
B	but and
A	yeah I think that would
B	mm
A	they were allowed six months and I think they submitted it in month six
B	mm
A	and then erm I think that was about September and then they were trying to get dates for the er planning inspector
B	mm
A	so there was eleven months from the first DCC meeting
B	mm
A	erm
B	mm
A	that it would be four days
B	mm
A	and then they couldn't
B	another one yeah
A	down at
B	mm
A	so there were another few months went er went by
B	the those are the tactics that they need to do
A	yeah and this is what I was trying to get across to them last night because
B	but I I sort of take
A	no I don't think they are
B	with the the
A	but to be fair
B	the
A	both parties
B	developers well both parties could be
A	well yeah oh oh oh there's no doubt that the developers are not on the same league as
B	mm
A	Ecotricity because this is probably the first or second one that they've done
B	yeah yeah exactly
A	I may be getting the applications mixed up but I think this company was only formed erm two months before the
B	yeah
A	the thing surfaced
B	yeah
A	so they are not in the same league as Ecotrocity
B	and they're not in the same league as you
A	well we started off knowing nothing to be fair
B	mm
A	when it dropped through our letterbox in July twenty O nine it was phew what's this?
B	mm
A	and nobody knew about it
B	mm
A	apart from your next door neighbour
B	mm yeah
A	and the farmer
B	mm
A	erm so we started from a pretty low base
B	and that was all in two thousand and nine?
A	that was two thousand and nine so very quickly we got ourselves organised
B	mm
A	and right fellas let's get as much information
B	mm
A	on everything
B	mm
A	on the company and
B	mm
A	what a wind turbine is and what it does and
B	mm
A	visuals and everything
B	mm
A	erm
B	and you and
B	oh right
A	and we had two rehearsals before we
B	mm
A	and from our research it it how it all came about at this Climate Change Panel
B	mm
A	so then we went down that route of the Climate Change Panel of the CVs of all the
B	mm
A	people on the Independent Climate Change Panel
B	mm
A	who we have international national and local climate change experts
B	mm
A	but they forgot to tell us that two of them were employed by Ecotricity and two of them were school kids
B	mm
A	and another one was a guy who filtered the muck out of chip shop fat
B	yeah
A	and ran an old bus on it
B	and a vicar
A	and a vicar seeking divine guidance
A	so that's when we went to see
B	but last night they didn't seem to know
A	that's right
C	I think they did know something about it
A	but he the the chairman
C	cos someone referred to it
A	the chairman
C	on the
A	the chairman mentioned about
B	but the rest of them didn't seem to
C	but he mentioned
A	no
C	the word cumulative
A	that's right what I don't know is whether the letter from
B	well yeah
A	making representations to
B	but my reading of that and cos you showed me the letter
A	yeah
B	was that they they will have to do
A	well the body of the letter
B	yeah
A	that everybody
B	involved
A	English Heritage and Natural England and archaeology and that yes it's gotta be done but
A	saying
B	yeah
A	about
B	but the guy that erm
A	yeah
B	they were absolutely adamant he said that they were not going to do an EIA
A	mm
B	but if they have to it's quite nice really cos it's
A	oh yeah
B	it's time and money
A	well that's right
C	but surely they've won if they have to do a EIA
A	I would have thought that er some of these tin pot developers are not gonna be in a position financially
B	they won't
A	or
B	well they won't know how to go about it
A	or technically to know how to do it
B	will they? and when they realised that all these experts cost money that they
A	that's right
B	would get in to
A	mm
B	you know to do it
A	well the thing the thing that was I was trying to get across last night was there are a small number of things that you ought to do one is
B	mm
A	less turbines less solar panels
B	mm
A	blah blah blah
B	yeah yeah
A	er the second thing that you do is put as much cost on them as you can
B	mm
A	and this is why we advertised for a heritage expert for save
B	and the noise I mean that must have
A	because they are
B	that must have put them back you know
A	well
B	forty fifty thousand pounds those two to get them
A	oh well
B	mm
A	the
B	cos he's got a
A	if we've got a heritage expert up there
B	and he's gotta take that all onboard
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	so you can double so the fifty thousand pounds you can
B	there you are darling
A	you can double it
B	that's what you did mm
A	and that's what it was all about
B	mm
A	cos there's force as much cost on the other side as you can
B	mm
A	erm
B	mm
A	and that's two hundred and fifty thousand quid that you can't spend building a turbine or
B	mm mm
A	and there's the other thing was to duck and dive and put the pressure on the local planning authority
B	mm
A	that was where they started from
B	mm
A	erm
B	mm
A	but I'm sure that's what they ought to be doing up there
B	mm
A	and they'll have to pay
B	mm
A	erm
C	EIA is Environmental
A	Impact Assessment
C	yeah assessment isn't it yeah
B	mm
A	but it could be
C	so who does that? does the developer do that or the
A	the developer's got to put one in
C	oh so it's to the
A	no
C	planning authorities
A	no all the cost is with the developer but it could be that all the developers get together you see
C	but then er shouldn't they have a landscape expert the
A	well
B	yeah
A	er
B	mm
A	and I would imagine any landscape consultant worth his salt er would not have five hundred acres worth of solar panels er in the
B	mm
A	because of the views from the
B	why can't pressure be put on them to have a landscape consultant?
A	well that's what I hope
B	because so many of these things can be just stopped
A	that's right
B	in their tracks
A	that's right but
B	if if if it was said that you don't stand any chance
A	that's right
B	or you stand very little chance er
A	that's right but
B	you'd go and find another site
A	mm but what er what
B	mm
A	therefore it must be right
B	mm
A	erm
C	mm
A	but you know vested interest isn't it?
B	well you need
A	that's right
B	well I mean we pay a lot of council tax
A	so we do indeed
B	why can't they?
A	erm
B	and this is a very sensitive
A	and
B	area
A	and one of the reasons that they did not employ a landscape consultant was because they said they haven't got any money
B	mm
A	when I challenged that
B	mm
A	at the time why er
B	mm
A	the Protection of Rural England?
B	mm
A	cos their two experts erm were dead
A	were totally ignored
B	mm
A	there is indeed
B	the position and the
A	that's right
B	you know power
A	but it may have done everybody in the
B	mm
C	yeah
A	that was under the radar I didn't even know
B	mm
A	and a lot of people didn't even know
B	mm
C	but don't you think that they see
A	yeah I'm sure they do
C	these developers?
A	yeah
C	they wouldn't go and do it up the
A	no they certainly wouldn't
B	well how can they how come it wasn't flagged up? I mean don't you put in for erm you know er erm wanting prior notice of these things? I mean it's
A	well it's not in
B	oh so you think well if it was if
A	well
B	oh she did know about it?
A	yeah
B	mm
A	but didn't do anything about it
B	oh she didn't let you know?
C	why not
A	that I don't know
B	how many acres is that then?
A	fifty I think is it fifty? thirty or fifty I think
B	how many football pitches is that?
A	oh I don't know I er cor it took me years to get a decimal er a metric never mind measuring things in terms of football pitches
B	isn't a football pitch two and a half acres?
A	well that's about one hectare then isn't it?
B	yeah
A	so erm
B	twenty-five
A	yeah
B	mm erm
A	but I er well the other thing I mean I I happen to believe that solar panels on doing it on this basis is an absolutely nonsense way of er
B	mm
A	harnessing the energy from the sun I accept that a few years down the track that most of our energy is gonna come from there but it ain't gonna come through these solar panels
B	mm
A	erm
B	get food
A	grow any food and
B	mm mm
A	and the wildlife
B	mm
A	oh I would think somebody's gonna come up er
B	yeah
A	with a
B	I mean it could be a completely different technology but still using the sun
A	yeah it'll certainly be using the sun
B	mm
A	er but it you'll have them er on windows and tiles and everything
B	in roads maybe
A	yeah and in roads down central reservations
B	mm
A	but the other thing is somebody's got to invent storing it
B	mm
A	a way of storing it
B	mm
A	oh well you can't store a meaningful amount like that guy up
B	mm
A	who was trying to lecture us that oh you can store electricity now he said
B	mm
A	with er water up hills and
B	mm
A	interconnectors and spare wind turbine power in Scotland can be exported to Norway
B	mm
A	erm
B	mm
A	and the rate at which erm innovation is coming along I mean what thirty years ago mobile phones were the size of house bricks very little
B	mm
A	connectivity
B	no
A	look at it now the rate of change is enormous
B	mm
A	and you know
B	mm
A	and you need a lot of solar panels to run a railway
B	mm
A	electric cars
B	mm well it's good you gave her a hard time
A	I think she quite enjoyed it to be honest with you
B	did she?
A	yeah I mean she was she was er I think she was
B	did you open her eyes a bit
A	yeah I think she learnt a lot
B	mm
A	erm
B	how did you get onto it?
A	er because as soon as she I I didn't know who she was
B	mm
A	to start with
B	mm
A	but
A	joking I said oh I said I er you're the wind turbine er girl then are you?
B	mm
A	and then she did say well possibly tidal and wave and I said well Ecotricity is trying to crack the wave one er but the amount of power that you'd generate in in the grand scheme of things you know it's miniscule and then she said about the barrage that the barrage across the Severn had you know probably do seven or ten percent of the nation's power requirements and I said perhaps we're a month till all the
B	mm
A	and she said she hadn't thought of that
B	mm
B	not
A	and she said er oh er
B	mm
A	and then she said her husband was coming back flying back from New Zealand and that was the end of the discussion cos I said
A	what was that doing for planet?
B	mm
C	how much money does the government put into research in comparison to the subsidies that are given to these
B	well
C	in comparison
A	oh I would
C	so
A	imagine it's only
C	really? but that's wrong isn't it?
A	I think it's wrong I I think the the priority
C	I mean as a taxpayer
A	yeah
C	wouldn't it be better or as a
A	oh
C	you know
A	yeah I I think it I think it would er but as long as the people in charge of the shop think otherwise we've
C	have they done that in America?
B	they still do the same stuff there though don't they? they the
C	no but they've gone ahead with fracking haven't they?
A	well
B	yeah but the desert
A	mm
B	they've got those panels in the desert
A	yeah that's right I think well in fact one er one possible way for us if you put the solar panels in the Sahara Desert near the equator on a couple of wires erm and develop a way of transmitting electricity that's
B	but you're gonna lose a lot of electricity over that transmission to just as
A	yeah
B	how much would you lose?
A	well
B	a lot?
A	well it would be more than ten percent I would think
B	mm
A	it er it er yeah probably quite a bit more than ten percent because you're losing in the grid system in the UK with the typical transmission losses will be about eight percent I would think
B	and it's gotta go under the sea at one point
A	yeah and putting it under
B	mm
A	cos people don't realise how much heat
B	mm
A	is comes off power wires
B	mm
A	erm if it's underground you've gotta put it in cooling water the cables
B	and people who don't like us can cut it
A	well
B	cut the wires
A	yeah that's a good that's a good point yeah
B	mm
A	so as far as possible try and be self-sufficient
B	mm
A	but then with the Scottish referendum er coming along there may be somebody cutting the wires or it may be us and not them
B	well that's another
B	mm
A	I think you're gonna get a I think the vote will be no rather than yes but it'll be fairly close and therefore the
B	mm
A	there is one merit in having a yes vote is that right that's it
B	mm they'll try again
A	we'll keep trying and trying and trying until everybody
B	until we get the right answer
A	falls over yeah that's right
B	yeah
A	till they get the right answer
B	mm
A	erm
B	they were saying at lunchtime on the radio that if it's a yes vote Cameron's gonna lose his job
A	yeah
B	it's a major failure
A	mm
B	of his
A	yeah I would you know I would think he
B	plus he got
A	he probably wouldn't want to continue
B	plus you've got the Clacton by-election
A	well that that's right but erm that result may be a bit closer than what people are currently predicting mind they're currently predicting sixty-four percent of the people who vote for the Ukip and twenty-three'll vote for
B	mm
A	for the Conservative but I don't see that well you see what's what's forgotten in on this Scottish erm referendum thing is if you go back to the last er General Election I think I'm right in saying that the Scottish Conservatives got more votes than the Scottish Nationalists
B	if you go back when?
A	to twenty ten
B	mm
A	mm mm
B	can't see that
A	well maybe we ought to go back and check up
B	mm
A	well that's a figure that stuck in my mind
B	really?
A	yeah
B	mm I thought that
A	I'll go back home and check that
B	I thought they were a a kind of erm an endangered species Conservatives in Scotland
A	well Conservative seats are an endangered species
B	yeah
A	cos it all depends how your individual votes are spread around don't it?
B	oh right okay
A	well maybe we'll check that then
B	mm
A	and they're not gonna if they go independent they're not gonna become members of the EU cos Spain'll see to that
B	mm yeah cos they don't want fragmentation
A	yeah they don't want er
B	Basque separatists
A	that's right
B	yeah
A	but the European vice president has said if you haven't got your own central bank erm you can't be a member of the European Union that's the treaty
B	it could just be a threat
A	er well that's the card that the Nationalists are playing but
B	mm
A	I I think they may be taking a big risk with that
B	using our
A	our banking system
B	mm
A	with a central bank that's there of lender of last resort to bail them out why would I wanna do that? I wouldn't wanna do it
B	mm
A	good point
B	call it the thistle or something
A	mm that's right but er
B	but that's not plan B I don't I don't think he's got a plan B
A	mm well they are threatening to renege on the their share of the debt which is an empty threat cos if they renege on that I can't think of too many people on the planet who
B	are gonna lend
A	will wanna lend them a few bob
B	yeah
A	two weeks' time innit?
B	two weeks' time
A	two weeks tomorrow
B	mm
A	that's right but some of the intimidation that appears to be going on is er
B	mm
A	makes you think
B	mm
A	so but anyway he's promised a better health service and free
B	but compared to
B	or Afghanistan or you know anywhere in the Middle East
A	that's right
B	it's just you know
A	that's right
B	very civilised really
A	mm
B	alright the the they're cutting out rough now the
A	mm
B	some of the Nationalists
A	mm
B	not the Nationalists the well yes
A	yeah
B	the parliamentary
A	that's right the yes er
B	yeah
A	yes element erm
B	but I mean
A	and that's a bit disappointing but having worked in Scotland but that's many years ago for a
B	mm
A	erm and
B	mm
A	can't
B	mm
A	could you imagine putting putting that on the curb stones round here the you know people from
B	well
B	unilateral independence here in
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah so
