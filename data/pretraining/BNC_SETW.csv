A	oh always put it on
B	ha ha
A	well it's another five minutes
B	because I  Because I  have gotta fill out a form and stuff which well is pointless if it's just a minute
A	oh right okay
B	and there is a relatively mm well you know there is a it's not an insignificant amount of admin for each recording so
A	right
B	yeah I'll um
A	subject waiting in petrol station forecourt
A	yeah
B	I'd like to talk about some fly-tipping huh ha
A	yeah that would be worth it
B	yeah
A	well no you could say first thing we need would be for you to put a bollard in
B	yeah
A	couldn't we
B	if they're dragging their feet
A	look I'd ring the site office first
B	right okay
A	oh my
B	ha ha
A	look behind you love
A	she's going out the
B	surely you can get round that side
A	I have no idea
B	probably not where there are pumps
A	how much would you like an open top car today?
B	that would be cool
A	yes
B	or I'd end up with sort of like a fright wig
A	I think that's a relative term
B	hmm mm
A	oh dear yes
B	it would be quite cool
A	as someone with a sense of humour comedy recently it's it would just be nice if with bearing in mind the sort of like eighty percent of the price of fuel is actually tax
B	mm
A	oh well the special thing is you actually pay VAT on the fuel duty
A	um
B	you pay tax on the tax?
A	yes
B	that makes sense
A	yeah sort of
B	it must be quite disconcerting having that guy sitting on his bike watching you fill up
A	oh well we'll watch him fill up
B	I'm waiting
A	the good news is he'll be quick
B	yes he will be quick
A	no
B	he might do
A	to be fair you shouldn't
B	oh hang on
A	no
B	no okay
A	oh right
B	or can you not do that?
A	no you can't do that
B	oh right okay
A	to be fair you shouldn't bike in jeans
B	why? Cos if you come off you'll break your legs
A	no um
B	mm
A	it takes leather a long time to burn through
B	yeah
A	see the reinforced patches on the elbows?
B	yeah
A	that's cos it that's what hits the ground if you
B	yeah and
A	the impact won't kill you
B	the slide will take your skin off
A	it will well you'll burn
B	right
A	A massive friction
A	and yeah it will just rip through flesh
B	yeah
A	well the point of leathers is that leather is very tough
B	mm
A	it's got a
B	in science in primary school
A	yeah
B	and leather you can't make a scratch on
A	er I'm not sure you can do that love
B	presumably it just won't let her get the fuel out
A	uh
B	some people are just really really impatient aren't they?
A	yeah apparently
B	ooh he's gonna be pissed off if it's double his cost cos of what she's been getting out
A	I don't see how that's working
B	it's not
A	you idiot
B	worked it out yet? Come on
A	wow
B	ah
A	Jesus
B	presumably he's trying to park
A	are we about to be ram raided or something?
B	he's making heavy weather of it isn't he?
A	oh
B	ah right
A	that was er one of the more special things I've seen yeah
B	look
A	the problem is that it's a
B	put it back
A	I think what's confusing here is there's two sets of pumps on each thing
B	now now now wait
A	oh
B	zero
A	now if you look cos there is four options
B	yeah
A	so there's four points but they're in sets of two
B	yeah
A	so I think
B	so she's assuming that
A	I guess he looks quite nice
B	doesn't he
A	sort of huggable
B	and that's great because he didn't need to move forwards to refuel
A	exactly
B	so it's actually quicker yeah
A	it saved a huge amount of time
B	yeah it was good
A	yeah cos as soon as the other chap paid he could er
B	mm
A	get on with it
B	Good stuff
A	erm but you
B	bikers are often quite nice aren't they?
A	yeah tend to be unless they're like
B	yeah scary bikers
A	well unless they're sort of American style Hell's Angels type
B	wild Hogs
A	yeah
B	it's a bit embarrassing
A	erm er the sex wasn't it the er erm er you know in films
B	yeah
A	er a group of Hell's Angels at an orgy
B	I don't understand
A	it was just a joke about the fact that the sex is the only integral part of the story
B	oh okay
A	I dread to think
B	some kind of survey
A	yes
B	oh no I can't imagine
A	oh I can see it possibly
B	right
A	right
B	shall I get out and?
A	yeah sure
