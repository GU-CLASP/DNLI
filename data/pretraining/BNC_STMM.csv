A	my my parents can't afford to like look after me for months or anything like that
B	mm
A	I mean neither of them can
B	so it's not like you can just go and get a job it's not that straightforward?
A	yeah
B	mm
A	cos last year I wasn't in my in my right mind to make that decision
B	was it a rash decision when you dropped out of uni last year?
A	inspiration
B	okay
A	but yeah I didn't really take much thought on my part like I just did it
B	why did you erm
A	erm
B	yeah
A	kind of worked it was really weird actually like worked myself up all year kind of thinking oh it was like a really horrible time and I kind of worked it up as this sort of
B	mm
A	relive
B	mm
A	like another
B	oh gosh
A	find somewhere to live and it would it would be really stressful and it just didn't seem
B	why wouldn't you qualify for accommodation?
A	I don't know because apparently like
B	cos you'd been before?
A	that lasted and yeah that counted as like my first year and you only get one year
B	did you have to pay for the whole tuition fee?
A	erm
B	or only first term?
A	no I think I'm paying that back when I'm older
B	oh so
A	yeah
B	it's so unfair isn't it?
A	yeah
B	cos you didn't actually get the tuition
A	I know
B	no exactly
A	yeah that's that's
B	mm
A	but it's still you know it's still there which is
B	yeah yeah
A	which is really shit
B	how far is
A	er it's about twenty minutes
B	mm
A	the uni
B	yeah
A	isn't actually in
B	oh my god
A	mm
B	are there any people at
A	erm
B	like you just say like ah
A	mm
B	oh yeah
A	but that's about it really
B	yeah
A	I didn't have any friends
B	mm
A	other than him
B	mm
A	and I didn't really make friends in my classes like
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah I mean it's like
A	it is it's
B	mm
A	I would probably have left already doing this
B	yeah
A	I really think that
B	mm
A	and
B	yeah definitely
A	I don't feel like I could've done the work
B	I mean I I guess a good flat means that like
A	yeah exactly
B	whereas if
A	and your flat's not very nice
B	and your flat
A	you just don't have anything to
B	and you just don't have anything to
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah that's how I felt at
B	mm
A	mm
B	maybe it's
A	you just got on with them for the sake of it kinda thing?
B	yeah like I thought that oh yeah we we were really like
A	oh that's nice to hear
B	cos like
A	maybe not for you but that's
B	cos they weren't horrible horrible people it was just like
A	they just weren't like
B	I couldn't talk to them
A	yeah
B	they didn't seem to like talk about anything except like
A	I mean didn't you say they weren't very nice to you like when they found out about the stuff?
B	yeah they found out about
A	yeah
B	and I told them about it cos I live with them and I was like just it happens and stuff
B	and then
A	that's so shitty of them
B	like
A	yeah
B	mm
B	er they didn't seem to get it like they didn't
A	mm
B	understand and they were
A	that's not good
B	yeah
B	it is better here it's a lot better here
A	yeah
B	mm
A	and
A	the prospect of
B	yeah
A	in terms of my life in general
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	kind of thing
A	mm
B	rather than
A	yeah
B	which is a bit of a shame really because
A	it is but
B	it should be attractive things keeping you here not the fear of leaving but yeah
A	yeah
B	because
A	but then again like my flat is keeping me here cos I don't wanna leave
B	yeah
B	I like this flat
B	really lonely? okay
A	really angry at myself I expect
B	I mean do you think if you went home for a short time do you think you'd feel better or not?
A	erm
B	like for a few weeks?
A	no
B	no?
A	because to be honest I don't feel like really erm
B	okay
A	it's more of an anxiety thing now I think
B	yeah
A	yeah I dunno
B	no yeah yeah I was thinking
A	it was just now I'm feeling like okay
B	mm
A	but
B	no
A	mm
B	it's gonna like fluctuate
A	yeah
B	mm
A	ever come back I don't think
B	no yeah it'd be a very
A	and it would get a lot harder to come back
B	I envy people who can just go travelling
A	er who have money yeah I know
B	I know some people work hard and they get it
A	and yeah
B	but
A	yeah
B	they're able to go and it's
A	but I mean I wouldn't be able to though if if even if I did work to get money I would have to pay that money back
B	mm
A	to the uni and to
B	yeah
A	have to pay my phone bill and just stuff like that like
B	yeah
A	yeah so it wouldn't be very easy to
B	mm
A	going to other countries on my own
B	yeah
A	don't want to
B	oh my gosh
A	and it's just scary to think about it like that
B	mm
A	cos you know the reason we're at uni is to avoid that
B	definitely
A	prospect like it's to get a degree and have that instead of just having to get job after job
B	mm
B	it is
A	and that's why I'm staying here really like that's what's keeping me here
B	scary thing
A	I mean that's I suppose it's something
B	it is something like
A	yeah
B	as shitty
A	doesn't have to be all
B	as it can seem
A	sunshine and rainbows like
B	cos yeah do you think?
A	cos I enjoy
B	I don't
A	I don't really enjoy much to be honest but I I
B	mm
A	is a better word
B	because when you're living at home like you're not necessarily content with everything either
A	no
B	yeah
A	wouldn't be cos my family would like
B	yeah
A	I'd get such judgement
B	mm
A	like you need to get yourself together and all of this crap
B	no
A	and then you
B	is that what she wants?
A	and then she's gonna
B	professor
A	and that's what she wants to do and then she's gonna write
B	is that how you feel about it?
A	it's always gonna be like that yeah always
B	mm
A	you know?
B	you're still
A	mm
B	intelligent
A	well
B	you're
A	I don't really feel like that but
B	like
A	yeah
B	cos maybe difference with her is that she can kind of
A	mm
B	and then they learn to see the good in themselves
A	yeah
B	like some people can just well they always have just been comfortable with themselves but some people find it more difficult
A	mm
B	god I sound like
B	she used to say that sort of thing to me
A	it's good practice for when you become a counsellor
B	her
A	you'd be a very good one
B	I'd like to do I'd like to work with young people I think
A	mm
B	like
A	what sort of counselling though surely not CBT cos everyone hates
B	oh I don't know the types that's how inexperienced I am like
A	well I know there are two like
B	there's CBT
A	yeah
B	there's
A	I know like three
B	mm
A	and then there's just like talk therapy
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	I don't know what like specifically I would like to help people with
A	mm
B	this person just has problems with that
A	mm
B	that go to counsellors have a range of problems despite having like one
A	yeah
B	problems isn't it? so it's not just like untangling one or two it's like
A	mm
B	quite sad and it might be quite hard
A	yeah it would
B	but I'd I'd enjoy doing that
A	but you'd feel good about it though cos you feel like you
B	you'd be making a difference
A	yeah
B	like
A	yeah
B	difference to you like
A	yeah
B	it's it's important
A	mm
B	the age is relevant like
A	yeah
B	like fifty and it's like I couldn't really relate to them like
A	I suppose how long does it actually take to get into that kind of
A	I don't know
B	I don't think it takes very long
A	yeah
B	so they're gonna
A	and they usually have like
B	some of them do yeah
A	if they're really high up
B	mm
A	I know
B	your social skills don't necessarily reflect
B	here we go
A	yeah
B	it's raining
A	there is no minimum level of qualification that needs to be reached
B	mm
A	one year full time
B	that isn't very long is it?
B	I'd
A	or do it part time if you've got busy things on
B	possibly
B	let's face it
A	who knows? you might get knocked up
B	oh ha ha
B	quite funny if that actually did happen
A	who knows what's gonna happen this week with that boy?
B	oh god me and
A	you and
B	what if what happens if you could you have if you got pregnant at university would you have the option to stay?
A	yeah of course you can stay at uni if you've got kids they're gonna discriminate that
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah but what if you're living in halls?
A	loads well not loads of people but some people do
B	yeah
A	like
B	must be really hard
A	and then they usually have a play school
B	ah
A	and they've got
B	do they get free nursery
A	I'm not sure if it's free
B	if it is then like that'd be amazing
A	they they've got one next to the
B	not that I'm planning on getting pregnant while I'm that would not be a good idea
A	no but just see next year they do have a nursery
B	so if that happens
A	yeah
B	it doesn't actually
A	oh wow
B	it's gonna be okay Mr rabbit
A	there may be a minimum age limit interviews and written assessments
B	well if you think about it what are you doing with your counselling? you're talking you're learning skills it's not like
A	it's not
B	yeah and you probably
A	and they don't earn very much
B	that is not much
A	yeah
B	like
A	most employers prefer you to have
B	but the thing is looking at
A	yeah
B	and they can get better help
A	well that's why you should go private really
B	yeah
A	I'd wanna go private
B	yeah exactly
A	but I wouldn't make it expensive
B	no yeah
A	only if it affordable cos I know how annoying it is to not be able to afford a good counsellor
B	definitely
A	mm yeah it's just a piss take
B	cos you could do a range because I know somebody like
A	mm mm
B	and they use toys to kind of like
A	yeah
B	which is nice isn't it?
A	yeah it's funny though I've never asked her actually cos we're not as close as me and my other auntie but one of my aunties is actually a counsellor now like
B	mm
A	a proper
B	mm
A	like a good proper
B	oh wow
A	to take with her like for her
B	yeah
A	with the clients to like explain things better
B	you could be a good counsellor I think
A	she'd probably have a
B	no but I think counselling cos you're
A	oh thanks
B	yeah you are though
A	that's a good compliment
B	it is
A	yeah
B	like you are a good listener
A	it's nice to listen
B	and a good talker and a good listener it's not like
A	well I'm not a good talker but
B	you're a good talker you're interesting like I like the stuff that you say
A	well no I'm but I prefer listening
B	and you also listen to me so that's cool
A	mm
B	it's a nice balance
A	yeah
B	I've also learned like
A	yeah
B	if you they won't get anything out of you they kinda say it another way like
A	mm
B	they say okay
B	he goes no it's okay
B	and it goes so
A	that's so funny
B	I would not be like a
B	that is important
A	but then you'd end up probably not using them
B	they're so archaic and old like
A	stupid
B	you don't want
A	yeah
B	cos like you know?
A	and people can see right through you when you do
B	like if you're watching like
A	yeah
B	like there's such like a superiority
A	yeah
B	and that like you wouldn't want that
A	yes
B	it's so good like the whole thing is just depressing but
A	mm
B	it's a good film
A	Angelina Jolie is so good in that film
B	she's
A	yeah I know the blonde it looks so good
B	it's sad as well
A	mm
B	Daisy?
A	yeah
B	what? really? how did she die?
A	yeah
B	oh no
A	or a car crash
B	wow
A	I know
B	what was wrong with Daisy?
A	she was in like some of my favourite nineties films
B	she was like
A	er she was erm in love with her dad or something
B	didn't her dad like sexually abuse her and he gave her like?
B	oh gosh
A	yeah
B	wow okay
A	like she had a erm
B	oh wow okay
A	yeah
B	have you read the book?
A	no I haven't actually is it good?
B	I've read some of the book yeah it's really good
A	yeah
B	it's really
A	mm
B	it's one of those books that's very heavy though that's the thing
A	yeah
B	that's why I haven't finished it like it's so good but you can't read it for long periods of time because you get so depressed
A	mm
B	and so sad
A	cos I always feel like
B	oh they are
A	and it kind of scares me sometimes it's just like oh the film wasn't like this I'm
B	mm
A	I prefer reading books before I've watched the film every time
B	it is better reading the books first
A	I'm one of those people that's just like read the book
B	yeah same
A	mm
B	it's not a bad book it's a good book but I think the film just made it really like
A	cheesy and you know teenage yeah
B	er
A	no film wasn't that great
B	it makes you
B	mm
A	cos it did I remember like
B	it's like
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	which is what it's supposed to be like
B	yeah of course yeah
A	like you he he has
B	we're all one
A	we have something in common with this
B	does your
A	yeah
B	I know somebody third year doing English literature
A	yeah?
B	I
B	she's editor for something but yeah
B	yeah
B	that's her
A	oh it's her no I don't think I know her
A	is she friends with
B	yeah
A	wow
A	probably does know her cos she's done stuff for
B	that's really cool small world
A	how do you know her?
A	from
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	thought so
B	and she does like cos she's like really big like
A	yeah she's friends with
B	she's really big on erm
B	like
A	oh my god so you knew my sister?
B	yeah
A	like third hand before I knew you?
B	yeah yeah
A	that's funny
B	basically
B	because she's really big on stuff like feminism and
A	cool
B	issues like that so I kind of found her blog and it was like oh cool
A	oh that's awesome
B	and she writes stuff so she posts that on it
A	yeah
B	not like
A	yeah
B	yeah she is cool she's cool
B	oh
B	oh my gosh
A	sounds about right
B	wow
B	jesus
A	but I suppose you
B	mm
B	it's crazy
A	mm
B	between the rich and the poor
A	oh I thought you meant men and women
B	oh no well yeah as well but like
A	that too
B	it was like
A	yeah
B	more income than sixty percent of
A	well it's this stupid idea that the government have got that the wealth will trickle down
B	no
A	I mean as if like that's really the complete opposite of what is happening right now
B	of course that's not gonna happen
A	but that's what they're saying with this austerity measure thing like
B	they don't
A	because they're expecting their wealth to
B	of course that's not gonna happen
A	because they avoid tax and
B	Gary Barlow is a tax avoider
A	is he?
B	mm
A	shit
B	well he is being found to
A	oh I thought Gary Barlow was nice
B	he seems nice doesn't he?
A	damn you Gary
B	and apparently
B	yeah
B	it's
B	it's like
B	I've seen him in the kitchen laughing
A	really?
B	like just throwing his head back and just laughing his head off it's so weird
B	but yeah
A	Gary
B	Gary Barlow
A	I've always thought of him as of as having like a really
B	oh he does
A	and then he comes from where you live
B	yeah
A	it's quite funny really
B	I forgot all those voices like he's like
A	your your voice isn't as slow as his though
B	what's
A	yeah
B	is my voice really slow?
A	but I think it's
B	oh not that slow
A	it's no it's not slow at all it's like a normal voice it's just northern
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	good
A	I went to the supermarket
B	does he?
A	and got some groceries
B	he doesn't speak like that that's like
B	how does he speak?
A	slow
B	does he?
B	oh my god
A	yeah
B	that's like Yorkshire that we're not
B	people round here speak really like
A	yeah
B	oh yeah
B	is
A	well it's not southern it's just like my accent it's like no
B	oh right okay
A	it's not really very accenty accent
B	oh my
A	yeah
B	some people just speed like oh my god
A	I know it's
B	same I
A	I know I find speaking really difficult sometimes
B	same
A	like it should be second nature cos it's like
B	I think cos of grammar and
A	yeah
B	like structure you're like
A	yeah
B	cos you start to say one more thing and then you change and you're like hang on
A	yeah
B	neither do I particularly
A	so no I don't really know
B	but who wants to speak with words that nobody understands in real life?
A	well
B	you you just
A	no I don't
B	er
B	oh my god
A	like I'm from a Dickens novel it's really funny
B	what? just accidentally?
A	yeah
B	oh my god
A	and so
B	that's so funny
A	yeah
B	that'll be yeah
A	you'll you'll definitely know
B	oh
A	wish I could do some more art but I don't really
B	yeah you should do some art
A	I know but if I'm gonna do something I should just do this shouldn't I? this bloody essay
B	you said a few weeks ago you didn't wanna do art and now you're like
B	are you looking at apprenticeships?
A	no I'm looking at the
B	oh
A	counselling thing still
B	I was just like
B	I think they're kind of I'm actually seriously thinking about counselling now after
A	yeah you should
B	uni
A	yeah
B	but then I like my writing and I like
A	yeah
B	if I can call it my craft
A	no it is
B	I don't think I'd wanna be a lecturer though
A	yeah
B	and I'm not that person
A	the funny thing is like my sister and her boyfriend want to
B	that's gonna be the best
A	and they're like
B	partnership
A	and they're gonna be so rich
B	yeah
A	if they become like proper good lecturers
B	what subject does your
B	oh okay
A	I know
B	wow
A	really clever
B	does he enjoy it that and he's really into it?
A	yeah
B	the hardest subject yeah
A	and I only did it like
B	oh my god
A	I would just come out of the
B	oh my god
A	frying my brain
B	really?
A	is it just the illusion of a table?
B	how does that work?
A	it's doesn't work it's just fucking stupid
B	course it's a fucking table
A	it's really
B	somebody made the fucking table
A	I know
B	which is why it is a table
A	yeah but how did they make the table out of what?
B	wood
A	yeah but before that
B	marble
A	it's
B	what?
A	it's all atoms
B	no it is because atoms are something right?
A	yeah but you can't see them
B	yeah but atoms are
A	and this is the really frustrating debate we're having
A	it was like that
B	but
A	yeah but who
B	okay
A	there we go
B	sorry to trash your room
A	and then we
B	so this
A	and that we're all just Sims
B	that has been put there by somebody on a computer
A	who knows you know? they could've just controlled you to do that
B	so I
A	no you didn't though cos it
A	oh it's just really fucking head fuck it really is
B	how can
A	yeah I know
B	like this bed is not real
A	that's why I would never ever wanna be a philosopher
B	I might not be comfy
A	yeah
B	but then again it might be quite satisfying like
A	I mean that's and that's just like the simple stuff like that was literally in our first lecture to get us
B	mm
A	and it was so confusing like you don't even know
B	my god
A	oh my god
B	I wouldn't enjoy studying philosophy
A	I I really didn't wanna do it
B	mm
A	cos there was also a philosophy A level
B	oh my god I can imagine
A	it was horrible
B	abortion week?
A	yeah
B	what did you do about in that?
A	but I
B	oh yeah
A	and I was just like
B	they weren't?
A	screaming at them like why are you not pro choice?
B	woman's body woman's rights
A	yeah exactly
B	also you saw in my essay that I wrote for my thing the argument against abortion being unnatural is animals
A	mm
B	so can humans
A	yeah
B	like it's not just
A	really?
B	like they do stuff with their nipples they play with their nipples
A	imagine if it was that easy for us
B	well it's not just like touch your nipple
B	bye
A	oh we're pregnant again
B	it's more like
A	boop
B	it's more it's like literally they probably have to torture themselves
A	oh
B	like doing it but like
A	that's horrible
B	but like
A	oh
B	but
A	how does that actually work?
B	erm
A	that's really
B	and yeah they they can like pull themselves open or and like
B	yeah it's horrible
A	that is horrible
B	but it just proves that like other animals do it for certain reasons
A	ah
B	so should humans like I know we've got science that has helped us
A	yeah
B	did we?
A	yeah
A	have you never seen an an abortion like
B	yeah
A	cos
A	no we don't
A	but we had to watch a video on it
B	mm
B	mm
A	it was just so stupid it wasn't even a Christian
B	would you I mean would you have an abortion?
A	it was like a
B	mm
A	at all
B	mm
A	yeah
B	I would if I wanted one
A	yeah
B	mm yeah
A	I'm certainly not against it I don't believe in the whole bullshit of like oh it's a human life what if it
B	it yeah if I wanted to keep it'd be cos
A	what if
A	you never know these things
A	and you're not gonna know them like
B	what if that little ant we stepped on was gonna grow up?
A	and do you know the amount of eggs we lose whenever we have periods? like that's the exact same thing you're losing when you have an abortion like it's fucking stupid
B	yeah that egg could've cured cancer bye bye

B	I thought ginger wasn't
A	no it
B	yeah
