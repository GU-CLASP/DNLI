B	mm
A	some part of a gut of an animal
B	down there?
A	mm
B	I often leave animal they often bring them in at night and leave their kidneys I think for a little present for us
A	yeah apparently someone told me that the reason cats do that is they're trying to teach you how to hunt cos that's what mother cats do for babies they'll bring back a dead
B	really
A	or alive
B	I think they just do it because
A	because they want to
B	because they're cats mm
A	oh
B	one night I went to go to bed and got top that step and there was a whole dead rat lying on the step
A	er oh that makes me feel sick
B	and they obviously found a nest outside because they erm because for several days after that didn't they that every every day
A	er you'd get a rat
B	not in they didn't that's the only one they brought into the house but they left one deposited outside the backdoor
A	er that's disgusting
B	but they must have cleaned out the whole nest because we haven't seen any since
A	oh that's good at least you
B	mm
A	they've kept rats away from the house
B	yes but I could do without them being deposited on the stairs it was big wasn't it?
A	er rats are disgusting
B	oh yeah it's when they bring them in alive I don't like it when they bring them in dead
A	no they bring them in alive cos they're so sweet they don't move
B	I know
A	they just sit there and then
A	not normal mice I don't really like cops they run around and you can't catch them
B	I do that sometimes if er if I think well I've tried to save your life you stupid little creature
A	if you don't realise what I'm trying to do for you
B	you don't deserve to be saved

B	yeah why did
A	erm oh yeah I remember because I couldn't book the one of theirs shall we have
A	couldn't book the one of theirs
C	oh
A	erm and I thought I couldn't go because for some reason my booking wasn't going through
B	right
A	cos I needed a DNI number which is like the Peruvian equivalent of an identification number or a erm national insurance number
B	what type
A	I don't know
B	perhaps cos they're American and you're British?
A	possibly but anyway they yeah I couldn't book it and I thought I don't I don't have a DNI number but it just wouldn't go through to the booking on the internet without this number
B	yeah
A	and so I don't have one and so I just I just ran to
B	from abroad
