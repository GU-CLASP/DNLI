A	yeah yeah
B	bless her I think she
A	and they they were quite soft actually like when you sit on it it just kind of sinks away

A	yeah
B	well she's the one that's sewing it she's sewing it all up so

A	it's alright
B	the one in erm the one that's gonna go in the study is the blue one yeah?
A	yeah
B	maybe the green one as well maybe we won't bother doing the green one
A	well yeah I think the blue one will be enough

A	mm
B	buys some more stuffing and sews it all up for us
A	yeah
B	they're so sweet aren't they?
A	mm
A	did you see the construction work at er uni?

B	yeah
A	didn't you see it?
B	oh I didn't look that way
A	there's about a hundred cranes
B	I didn't go that way
A	oh
B	that's behind the teaching
A	bloody hell they built this road quickly
B	oh you if you drag her backwards it'll be alright
A	if I push her really quickly
B	no not quickly
A	do you wanna grab the front of it?
B	yeah I can't oh yeah I'll just grab those wheels just a little bit there oh
A	wow look at this
B	oh my god
A	they sure do build quickly don't they?
B	yeah
A	fuck built a whole road in
A	what? three weeks?
B	I dunno when's the last time we came down here?
A	er
B	watch out there's all these
A	er
B	oh
B	they need some traffic lights and stuff here don't they?
A	yeah think they'll have to once that road opens
B	mm
A	it's too dangerous
B	well good because I want a traffic light here
A	it's
B	yeah look they're all coming round there too oh where are we going? are we crossing or not?
A	so that road is gonna go to the theme park is it?
B	I'm confused at what you're doing
A	er just waiting for that traffic to
B	oh okay
B	the theme park what? what you reckon it's straight straight down that road?
A	well if you go straight down there yeah then you're
B	oh oh I don't like doing that I wouldn't like to do that on my own you know with the pram
A	mm
B	go across that road well well it depends on the traffic doesn't it? it's alright but
A	so what else did
B	oh just that he was worried about his he's gonna have his student visa come in but
A	oh yeah
B	it's only gonna last a year so he's gotta find another visa but he's got a whole year to sort this out oh and his
A	well he can't just keep renewing his student visa
B	his wife went out and bought loads and loads of beauty products
B	er cos he couldn't think what it was I don't think it is makeup I think it's like creams and stuff
A	mm
B	loads of stuff for her face and er she bought the most expensive stuff
A	yeah
B	and he said but you've got two jobs we've got no jobs
B	he said I'm unemployed
B	you're both employed so you can buy what you like
B	I was like yeah that's true
A	well she should go and get a job then
B	yeah well
A	she's just a party animal
B	mm
A	she spends all his money down the pub
B	what? buying champagne?
A	buying bottles of whisky and champagne for everyone
B	why does she do that? it's just all front isn't it?
A	yeah
A	that's what China is isn't it? it's all front at the moment it's
B	yeah
A	it reminds me a bit of nineties Britain where everyone's so image conscious
B	oh god yeah that changed didn't it?
A	yeah
B	like it's not like that anymore I don't think
A	oh no no not at all no I remember you know
B	when
A	no one would ever go in a charity shop and it was all about what
B	apart from
A	type of shoes you had and
B	me and
B	it was though and you know
A	yeah I mean in generally you know
B	yeah
A	no no one like pound shops didn't exist did they?
B	no
A	because people wouldn't have used them anyway
B	no I know people wouldn't have gone in them
A	everyone used to be so snooty in the nineties didn't they?
B	mm
A	it's really shit
B	yeah that's why I had trouble at school cos like I dunno just looked really crap in all these I had to I mean I had to work to get some money to buy some clothes
A	mm
B	if I hadn't have done that and the kids can't do that these days
A	er are these traffic lights working?
B	oh no
A	oh no
B	I'd have been hugely beaten up or picked on you know that would've been it would've been awful
A	oh fuck
B	oh my god
A	alright then
B	right we wait
A	what's going on?
B	they're coming this way it's green the that that middle thing they've put a
A	yeah that's green
B	temporary thing in
A	for the traffic to go straight
B	yeah that's right
A	there's like ten lanes of traffic here
B	they're going all over the place aren't they?
A	they are
B	it is like Vietnamese
B	how do they know where each car is going? it's like they've got sixth senses about them about it all
A	yeah yeah I'm surprised
B	erm
A	there's not more crashes
B	yeah in the nineties can you imagine if I didn't have a job and buy my own clothes?
A	mm
B	it would've been horrible
A	yeah well that's what it's like here cos people have suddenly got money
B	yeah
A	they're just
B	yeah but you can get
A	it's all showy
B	away with
A	er we're green
B	I think that's our cue to try and go
A	think so don't worry
B	I'll just well I'll just be hang on hang on blue wait there blue car and now it's green again oh my god wait wait wait wait wait
A	mm
B	jeez I don't know which
B	direction to look
A	well we made it
A	er I think getting a taxi would be best wouldn't it?
B	yeah
A	getting a taxi around here's easy
B	er she's quite she's quite hot isn't she?
A	right that's better bit more civilised now
B	the here you can buy stuff off the internet quite cheap
A	mm
B	and it can look like it's alright you know?
A	yeah
B	you can jazz yourself up but not with much money
A	yeah
B	but then to go on Taobao and buy the stuff you still need a credit card so that so
A	anyone can get a credit card
B	really? well my sister can't get a credit card at home
A	well that's because she's blacklisted
B	does it?
A	yeah

B	a platinum one
A	more money
B	I don't even use it they just send me a new upgrade each year
A	yeah
B	I don't even use it my account's just zero
A	I don't know what my credit rating will be like?
A	I still haven't got a credit rating
B	yeah you have cos we've got a credit card together
A	no but I looked it up and it counts it counts for nothing for me
B	really?
A	yeah it has to be in my name
B	ah but it helps towards you getting a credit card of your own
A	yeah
B	cos I couldn't
A	but I wouldn't have the same address
B	anyway you've
A	cos last time I I did try and get a credit card once didn't I? and it
B	yeah but that was when we were in our twenties
B	early
A	changed address too many times

B	my face what?
A	I think after forty-five it starts
B	well it depends whether you've looked after
A	still feel alright
B	yourself or not
A	at the moment
B	no this these are the
A	yeah
B	you're gonna be no honestly er that's why what are we gonna do? are we gonna buy that gym equipment and stick it in the study or are we gonna join the gym?

B	well what about muscular workout?
A	see all that land in front?
B	yeah
A	all that swamp well it looks like marshland
B	yeah
A	that's all gonna change into office block well into the part of the business district as well
B	is it?
A	like that first bit back there
B	it's gonna be like a whole city here
A	yeah that first bit that block back there is like zone one this is zone two and that's zone three over there
B	really?
A	and where they've built the theme park
B	so we
A	that's zone four
