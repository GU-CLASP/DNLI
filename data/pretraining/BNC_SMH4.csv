A	so what did you just say?
B	cake
A	we're just trying to work out instructions for a cake
B	so so
A	like what kind of
B	it's set to zero and we need to get it onto the line that's bigger than the tiny lines but not the biggest line
C	okay
A	cos how much do we need?
C	we need
B	a hundred and fifty
C	so we need the big line in the middle which is pointing straight at four
A	now can I just make a suggestion? I tend to do dry ingredients first so I tend to do flour and sugar
B	okay
A	first because margarine is a bit messier
C	okay now
A	yeah?
C	how much do we need for those ingredients? let me see we need one five 0 so that's the same as
A	yeah
C	the lightly salted butter so it's caster sugar first
B	oh
A	I would get cos it's an all-in-one mix so you're just
B	shall I do it
C	well
A	why don't you do it together?
C	so erm
B	right I'll tell you when
C	okay just
A	what I would suggest you do
C	no
A	tell tell her if she's doing it like er you can see
A	how are you doing?
C	yeah
A	you're on it? well you've got a
C	look
A	it depends where you're looking
C	I were looking
A	this
C	there
A	you that that black long line needs to be
C	it's in the big black line
C	yeah
A	yes
B	yeah?
A	is it a hundred and fifty?
C	okay
B	no
A	yes it is
B	I not
A	you're looking no you can't look at an angle you have to look at it from here can you see? because if you look at it over there it'll appear differently
B	cos
A	she's not in your way
C	oh
A	you can just look behind her so is it a hundred and fifty?
B	no
A	hang on
B	yeah a little
A	right
B	oh a tiny bit less
A	a tiny bit less or more?
B	I think it's alright actually
C	okay so
B	it doesn't be it doesn't have to be bang on
C	now we
A	well no it does need to be pretty bang on actually
B	pretty much but not exactly
C	can you pass me that please?
A	I'm just gonna give you this big bowl
C	so you can pour these in here
A	so you can put all of the ingredients into that one good so what I also do
B	oh yeah
C	yeah
A	so
C	so we need one hundred and seventy-five grams and six O zee for self-raising flour
A	right so it's it's a hundred and seventy-five grams or six ounces so we're doing grams so you
C	I don't
A	done?
C	I don't know when it's been done
A	well let's have a look together
A	of the way
A	move out of the way right
B	I
A	hang on a moment right
C	the big so it's
A	this one not the two hundred the one
C	so
A	just before
C	okay
A	alright?
C	stop
A	stop
C	that's enough
A	ah why are you carrying on going?
B	sorry
A	when I said stop?
A	but really why have you carried on doing it? why are you shrugging you're your head? why did you carry on?
C	keep going
A	because a a big chunk just fell it when you said stop
C	mm
A	no but you still did it right so are are we still over two hundred?
B	yes
A	right are we getting
C	yeah we're we're
A	we're on a hundred and seventy-five?
C	yeah
A	yes that is pretty spot on good so can you
C	I'll pour it in
A	now can you just double check is it an all-in-one recipe where you can add everything at the same time?
C	erm
A	there isn't a particular
C	it's
A	order?
C	like yeah you need to do it and
A	in all at the same time? okay
C	no you can't you need to do it
A	no no er no it just says put all the cake ingredients in a bowl so that's fine it doesn't really matter what order
B	can I crack the eggs in then?
A	well hang on a moment
C	hang on we need to put the butter in
A	you need to put the butter in
B	put the butter in put the butter in
C	and then with the and then you can crack one egg I can crack another egg and then we can both crack one egg
A	or I could crack a third egg
C	cool mum
A	yeah
C	I I come on
A	I don't mind you do one first
C	so we need the same amount as the
B	caster sugar
A	yeah a hundred and fifty
C	so which is
A	so let's just
C	here
A	first of all we need to make sure
C	so
B	shall I put it in?
C	tell me when no I'll do it tell me when to stop
B	okay
A	when it reaches a hundred and fifty
B	this is gonna take a while
A	oh darling just get a big spoon
C	okay I'll
A	hang on
C	and I'll just
A	hang on
C	put this in the dishwasher there
A	there you are
C	oh
A	try not to slam the drawers
B	and another spoon and then the same spoon to get it off that one
A	sorry?
B	that is a very irritating piece of butter
A	well
B	butter
C	it's margarine
B	it's
A	or margarine
B	same thing
A	no let her do it just get a really big look let's have a look something like that where are we
B	a hundred and fifty
A	dead on?
B	dead on
A	a hundred and fifty? that's only a hundred there
B	what? four point is only a hundred
A	what?
B	oh
A	nought a hundred two hundred so you need a little bit more
B	I think that is now
A	no it's not quite is it? can you see?
B	yeah
A	right that's the that's the the mark for a hundred and fifty
B	uhu
A	it's not there yet is it? it's really important
C	okay now
A	well do you think it's there now
B	erm no
A	right how about now?
B	yeah I think that's enough
C	okay get your eggs
A	right so you can add first of all add the margarine
C	mum please do I
A	you hang on leave all of the eggs
B	okay
A	or you end up cracking you know
C	if you
A	thousands of pieces of different shell
C	you
A	it's
C	can start mum then it
A	okay you want me to start?
C	yeah
A	right well I'm gonna crack do it straight in the bowl simply because I've got lots of experience and I've opened it and I know it's fine and there's not any bits of shell so that's my egg good
C	do you know what you do yours
C	hold the bowl for you
A	right listen
C	do just one big whack
A	one bit whack there you go and then put your thumb in
B	put your big
A	break break it apart
B	ah

B	not really
A	yes you have you've done
C	thank you
A	it's fine
C	there
A	that's got nothing to do with you not putting it in the bowl
C	there's a bit of shell in there
A	yeah a tiny bit of shell is fine cos we can take that out
A	you may need to get a little spoon to do that cos it tends to move when you put your finger in? have you noticed? and it doesn't stay there
B	oh I'll have a go it's a fun game
A	it's not a it's not a game there you can get it out with a spoon right so
B	well
A	done right pop the eggs in
B	I will
C	oh
B	you pop one in I'll pop the other one
B	yes you can mm there's one in already
B	that's the other one
B	no there was one that fell out
A	just do what you need to do
C	okay
A	now erm
C	okay it's
A	you have forgotten you have forgotten an ingredient
C	one teaspoon of vanilla extra I'll do that
A	extract no you need to use a particular teaspoon measurement which is this one so
B	oh yeah
A	right and make sure it obviously needs to be level because it's liquid
B	so you need to be here
A	so you need to put it hang your spoon over the bowl
C	I love vanilla
A	I love vanilla too now I'm gonna make you whisk it
A	by hand when I say not
C	oh can I do that first? can I
B	okay
C	do that first? I'll be
A	can you just double
A	check the recipe?
C	sorry put the margarine we put the baking powder
A	yes and what else?
C	we put the caster sugar in we put three eggs now I put the
B	so shall I start whisking now?
C	one
A	well just start whisking
C	teaspoon
A	gently
C	vanilla extra
A	extract
C	extract jinx
A	jinx double jinx triple jinx
C	no the person who jinxed you first
A	okay
A	what you could be doing
A	so could you please be putting twelve cupcake cases into the tray?
C	is there twelve on the tray?
A	can you count and tell me?
C	one two three four five six
B	yes there is twelve
C	yeah
B	I did it in fours
A	yeah fours or threes
B	or sixes
A	no cos they are in a row of four and a row of three
B	mm
A	so you would either say three six nine twelve or four eight twelve wouldn't you?
B	mm
A	yeah
C	I just counted three six one two three four
B	finding it a little hard
A	you're finding it hard?
B	a little hard
A	that's because
B	I've never whisked before?
A	well not for a long time but it's the the margarine
A	is pretty tough
B	yeah tough cookie
A	but you are doing very well so
C	then I'll have a go
A	and then you can have a go and what do you need to get rid of?
C	okay so we can have
A	right what do you need to get rid of in the batter?
C	we need to get rid of all the lumps
A	yeah
C	and make sure it's a nice smooth batter
A	yes
C	and make sure that it's not really hard
A	nice and smooth yeah
B	I'll hold the bowl in case
A	that is a really good idea
C	so it you need to get all the lumps out like these lumps we see here so make sure there's no lumps of butter or egg
B	why do you get lumps of egg?
C	well when you mix it
A	if you have
C	you mean like an egg yolk?
A	yeah well if you haven't mixed it you would get little lumps of it that's why we have to
A	mix egg when you scramble it don't you?
C	I've mixed I've made scrambled egg before
B	so have I
A	you've made
A	you're very good at that
