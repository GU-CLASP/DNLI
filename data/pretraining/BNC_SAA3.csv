B	I'll have a look and see if I've got cover and pillow cases
A	okay so shall I write that down?
B	yeah just I'm going to check that up
A	I'm going to put it at the bottom and just say maybe

B	yeah they're the I've ticked them off
A	yeah but I've got to tick it off on mine
B	okay
A	so cos I've got to know this as well
B	there's a couple of
A	for at the end when I give back everything I need to know who gave me what
B	we don't want it back er the only things that I'll want back
A	or at the end we'll decide if you want it back or not
B	okay yeah it may be that
A	yeah if you don't want it back you don't want it back but we'll look after everything as if you do want it back
B	okay
A	erm
B	but it's not a problem though if anything happens to it
A	okay cool one desk is yours yeah cos I mean
B	oh fantastic
A	and he's already got us a futon and they're going to get us a mattress as well
B	oh brilliant
A	so yeah so that's good
B	oh that is brilliant
A	so between us all
B	yeah we're sorted
A	so the desk is
B	yeah
A	you said two chairs?
B	yeah
A	what chairs are they?
B	they're gonna be this kind
A	yeah cool brilliant erm
B	I'll have to get
A	dad said he's got a table I don't know what kind of table he's talking about but hopefully some kind of table
B	yeah
A	erm okay so that's the chairs you said you had a small tool set
B	yeah
A	a wok
B	yeah
A	a breadboard
B	yeah
A	some storage jars and a bike
B	yeah
A	by storage jars do you mean like Tupperware or
B	I'll show you
A	yeah
B	no they're jars so
A	you also said a wardrobe
B	yeah yeah
A	a chest of drawers
B	yeah
A	a bedside cabinet
B	yeah bookshelf
A	and a bookshelf you do have a bookshelf?
B	I think so yeah but we'll have a look
A	awesome that's the extent of the list I've got
B	okay that's cool
A	have you got anything else on there?
B	no
A	awesome so yeah and if you can provide the rest of that that would be really good
B	see I've put some things down for
A	oh right
B	but he didn't
A	is he getting the wok then or
B	no I don't think so I don't think he wanted it so that was fine erm
A	okay
B	okay
A	and then extra stuff you don't have any lamps?
B	no
A	I don't suppose no washing machine we've already got so I can make that
B	tell you what I might have
A	washing machine and futon is
B	erm a mirror with a little light attached to it
A	okay
B	do you want me to check that out? it's one of these like
A	a mirror?
B	vanity minners mirrors
A	do you think we'd need that?
B	I don't know you'd need some kind of mirror in your place wouldn't you?
A	I imagine there's a mirror in the bathroom okay I'm gonna write it down
B	I'll write it down on the list and then I'll put a question mark on it
A	yeah maybe
B	I mean if you decide these we can bring them down later on once you're in you'll know more of what you need or what you could use and
A	yeah
B	we've got a printer upstairs in the loft but erm the cartridges would probably cost you more than going to a library and printing stuff off
A	erm quite a few of the printers nowadays don't the drivers aren't set up for the new Windows 8
B	yeah these are old printers so I'm not sure
A	so yeah I need to get a new printer I've
B	well maybe that's something
A	yeah that sounds good
B	congratulation getting engaged present
A	yeah sounds awesome
B	yeah? okay
A	if that's alright with you
B	yeah so if I put printer to get
A	but I mean you could just take me shopping and I can get the printer cos I mean probably I'm going to have to buy the printer on Amazon so I mean I'm going to have to pay for that anyway so unless you give me the money now
B	well I can transfer the money into your account
A	or you just take us shopping it's up to you
B	okay
B	I think I'd like to get you a gift I know it's stupid
A	well shopping's a gift isn't it?
B	yeah it's true
A	setting me up with all my spices and all that kind of stuff and everything
B	okay alright we'll do that then instead cos you'll need that earlier anyway won't you I should imagine
A	yeah I mean I'll need that although I may have already got that stuff by the time you come up and I probably have already got the printer by the time you come up as well
B	there's bound to be something though isn't there?
A	oh yeah there'll be something left over I'm sure
B	even if I just give you fifty quid for shopping
A	er fifty quid's always good I'm not going to say no
A	said if we do actually get married er I mean like April next year May erm
B	well not instead we'd give you that anyway as part of the getting married
A	no erm instead's fine cos I'm going to need a new suit and I think
B	of course
A	and I'll still need a suit so
B	you want to make it special as well
A	well
B	you can still do it on a budget
A	I mean er it's not going to be a wedding dress it will just be a dress
B	yeah something that
A	she'll just get a new dress so she can have a dress and
B	yeah
A	I'm going to need a suit for my new job anyway so
B	mm so it's multi
A	yes that's how it works
B	multi-purpose
A	we're still humming and harring over whether or not she's actually going to change her passport or not
B	really?
A	well the if we
B	could she not double-barrel it?
A	if we go on a weekday that still costs cos if you change your name in any way then you have to get a new passport so
B	but it's illegal isn't it? or can you
A	it's illegal
B	you can't you can't travel
A	she'd just keep her name
B	can you do that?
A	yeah you don't have to change your name at all she could keep her name in fact in the middle east where we're going they don't change their name the women keep their father's name rather than taking their mothers have taken them
B	could you not just erm
A	I think
B	yeah but if she did it that way then she would have to change it wouldn't she?
A	either way well then we'd both have to change it I mean if she was just one
B	yeah that's true
A	if she was
B	if you had
A	and if she
B	yeah but don't forget you're not going to be doing this on your own we put towards
A	yeah but I mean you can helping us get a suit can't you get me a suit
B	yeah yeah I know but the the things that you're thinking about which you say are a hundred pounds or whatever that could be covered in all of you know if you wanted to have your names the same
A	yeah I mean that's true erm
B	but that's something when you
A	but then also she'd have a new passport and we like collecting our stamps
B	yeah
A	and she might be a bit like I think maybe recently erm when we got the new apartment in Brighton they sent us a copy of the contract and they've written both of our names in as a Mr and Mrs
B	I think that's quite nice
A	maybe but I had to tell them that there was a problem
B	has she worn a ring?
A	yeah yeah she wears it she doesn't wear it all the time but she wears it
B	what finger does she wear it on?
A	that one so she said actually that she doesn't like wearing rings on these fingers anyway so she wears them obviously on that one
B	so that feels comfortable or even on her thumb maybe
A	but I mean I've promised her that the ring itself you know
B	mm it was a token yeah
A	if she loses it or it breaks so I don't want her to be freaking out about it if she lost it
B	yeah yeah
A	like people do with their wedding rings
B	yeah
A	I just said that I promised her that I will always replace that ring
B	yeah
A	and it doesn't have to be the same ring
B	she can choose the next one if she wants to
A	it could be a different ring yeah so
B	yeah
A	she will always have a nice wooden ring that I've bought her
B	yeah
A	so when that one breaks or gets old so the next one we can make it to fit here
B	yeah
A	if we do get physically married she'll buy me a wooden one that will fit
B	yeah that's nice
A	it'll just be like that really erm
B	mm it confused a lot of people didn't it on Facebook?
A	I bet it did yeah you know I mean I'm not particularly traditional
A	mm
B	god I'm tired today are you?
A	yeah I'm I was knackered last night when we went to bed completely knackered
B	well you must have been
A	but erm as I said I felt really spacey it was a bit weird erm I didn't sleep very well either
B	no
A	but I feel I feel better today erm it's jetlag isn't it I'm bound to feel a bit made for the first night
B	yeah I didn't sleep very well last night I think I was aware of kind of
B	I did
A	or was that was that you yeah
B	yeah because I suddenly
A	oh oh so
B	so I I crept down yeah so I otherwise he'd have been knocking and ringing the doorbell cos I'd put the key under the mat and then put the other keys and left them in the door
A	so you did leave them in there?
B	so I could have quite easily gone to bed and not even thought about it
A	yeah
B	but something it's weird isn't it
A	you'd have had to get up in the night
B	like something just triggers in your head when you go through the process of
A	so you did leave it in the door then?
B	I did I came down and took it out
A	yeah it is weird that stuff you pick up in your periphery isn't it?
B	yeah
A	like you don't realise that you had consciously noted
B	no
A	but then like yeah I've done that yeah I need to go and sort that out
B	it really is
A	it's a bit strange I have that sometimes
B	but then there are other things I think right I've got to go upstairs and do blah blah blah get up there and I can't remember what I'm doing
B	and I stand there yesterday was one of this instances and I walked out of the kitchen into here and I stood there and I thought I have no idea why I've just walked into this room
A	does that get worse as you get older?
B	I don't know
B	whether it's tiredness as well and
A	yeah
B	a lot on my mind I don't know but er finally it came oh oh oh
A	oh god was that your foot?
B	it was my
A	oh god
A	how long will that take to heal?
B	it says about four to six weeks so
A	and you've never broken anything?
B	no
A	you haven't even broken your ribs or
B	no
A	no
B	well not that I'm aware of
A	I think I've broken my ribs twice
B	was that the time dad sat on your shoulders?
A	no no the the first time was in Thailand I think I told you my I was
B	oh my god no I don't remember you tell me that
A	and like I felt it go oh crack and I couldn't breathe
B	oh it sounds like it then
A	and from what I looked up people said it you know it was a broken rib and then that happened again with
B	oh
A	in the same rib and like that was about three months later and then it I had the same pain and couldn't breathe and it was like couldn't sleep on it so I think I broke the same rib
B	so you wouldn't be surprised if you had an x-ray and you found few fractures there
A	no yeah
B	cos they can tell can't they if you've had broken bones whatever how old it is
A	I think I may have done
B	mm
A	this clicks like mad and
B	yeah I
A	put put your hand on it it grates and grinds and this hip does the same thing and when I run and my shoulder aches it really aches when I'm running never this shoulder always this shoulder or if I sit for too long this hip and down my leg
B	you need to get it looked at
A	aches this one never I don't get any problems in this one
B	don't leave it
A	I just don't like going to the doctor's see
B	yeah but you know you're only going to suffer more as you get older so sort it now it might be simple physio that will sort it
A	physio is like massage isn't it?
B	no physio is exercise it's like when I erm got my sciatica I ended up going to physio and she gave me exercises to do and it's all about your core muscles and like I mean I've got a bad back at the moment
A	but I do all these things I exercise I do
B	yeah but there might be something that they show you that just helps you don't know
A	you'd think like yoga would help but actually it can like
B	mm
A	aggravate it
B	inflame it
A	but erm just general stretching is quite good I try and stretch more now and like I tell you what I need it think these
B	you have a
A	no I don't I think that's the problem I think I need to have glucosamine tablets or to have more fish or something because I don't think I'm getting those omega threes is it or whatever they are?
B	yeah yeah
A	I think my first year in Korea I was getting more cos I was having school lunches but now I'm not
B	mm
A	so I'm like but erm
B	I don't know if that has anything to do with it it the only way you're going to know is you're going to have to go to the doctor's and they're going to have to erm pass you through to someone that knows
A	I just don't like the doctors you know I don't
B	yeah but you can't leave it
A	no I'm not going to leave it I'll do it when I'm at home I've told myself I'm going to do it unless it suddenly gets better but running was really aggravating it
B	well if it's arthritic and things like that the the damp weather is going to affect it more
A	running was really er
B	I don't think I can go back to running
A	no I like running though I really like it
B	oh so do I absolutely love it
A	I was hoping there'd be a swimming pool in Brighton but there doesn't seem to be
B	really? you'll have to go in the sea then
A	I mean there are swimming pools but then there's none like too close to my
B	did I tell you I got stung on my bottom?
A	yeah by a weeverfish or something
B	in the sea
A	I'm going to Google that actually what's a weever fish?
B	I had three accidents
A	is it like a stickleback?
B	well
A	yeah well like a stickleback it's got like
B	three yeah fins
A	spikes on its back yeah
B	spikes yeah
A	the stickleback fish let's see if it's
B	oh okay
A	do you remember I used to have a stickleback?
B	yeah
A	as a goldfish why isn't my keyboard working?
B	erm
A	I haven't even said that word for a year stickleback
B	stickleback
A	like there like that three little prongs coming off it
B	no now type in weeverfish
A	let's go and have a look at the stickleback I did have this fish didn't I had a little stickle I had a goldfish
B	I don't know
A	and a stickleback
B	are they compatible?
A	what like they mate?
B	no no no but they wouldn't eat each other or anything
B	see that's the weeverfish it's these prongs here
A	it's not too dissimilar
B	no
A	oh so it's famous for stinging people then
B	yeah
A	how bad is it mean to be?
B	awful it the guy said that he's had grown men crying with pain
A	did you leave well and you just treated it
B	no cos I was on the beach got out of the sea and I was like I've been stung I've been stung by something quick have a look have a look and
A	yeah
B	and my dad always used to kind of suck the
A	squeeze it and stuff yeah
B	yeah and stuck the the sting out and I was like it's getting worse I'm getting worse I said suck the venom out he goes you've gotta be joking
B	I said I don't care about anybody else just get rid of this sting and then I just hobbled up the beach and went straight to first aid
A	yeah this says here people often say it's much worse than a wasp or a bee sting you can have severe pain itching swelling redness numbness tingling nausea vomiting headaches abdominal cramps did you get any of these things?
B	no but afterwards
A	lightheadedness increased urination tremors
B	I felt extremely tired and I felt like I needed to go to sleep
A	rare and severe symptoms include abnormal heart rhythms weakness shortness of breath seizures
B	oh my god
A	gangrene tissue degeneration and unconsciousness mm
B	luckily I got my bottom in some hot water straight away
A	that's a bit random isn't it? although extremely unpleasant weever stings are not generally dangerous and the pain will ease considerably within a few hours even if untreated
B	mm
A	complete recovery may take a week or more so yeah you were lucky you got that done
B	well this erm the first aid guy they must've been in their mid well he was I think he was about twenty-four and I just thought I'm in so much pain here I don't care how embarrassing this is
A	there've been two deaths
B	what from weever fish?
A	someone died in nineteen twenty-seven
B	oh
A	multiple causes exacerbating it and then
B	oh it's probably something else I should imagine
A	but there you go you got stung by something legitimate
A	it wasn't you know
B	exactly I wasn't making it up so I did that
A	have you been stung by a jellyfish?
B	and then I felt no
A	yeah
B	but apparently jellyfishes are nothing
A	no yeah
B	in comparison to weeverfish
A	I've I've been stung by a jellyfish and it wasn't that bad
B	really?
A	I mean it depends on the jellyfish you can die from certain jellyfish anyway
B	do you remember the jellyfishes in the erm
A	they might've just been they might've just
B	oh maybe yeah yeah
A	because Portuguese man o' war or box jellyfish they can kill you so I think that's worse than a
A	I don't know which one stung me but it stung me three times when it got me cos they it stung me the first time and it was like an electric shock and then it spun me I swear it spun me round in the water with like a jolt
B	oh was this with us?
A	no this was with
B	oh okay
A	you know when we were like hitchhiking around?
B	yeah yeah
A	erm and then it got me again on my leg and on my side
B	oh my god
A	as I was like swimming off so it got me like three times so I kinda like went numb as I was trying to swim out of the water
B	you were lucky on that holiday weren't you?
A	oh yeah that was funny
B	I know
A	how did we find them?
B	I have no idea it still every time I drive up that road it still amazes me
A	we walked a good chunk of it as well as
B	you were shattered
A	yeah
B	you'd been through so much and you'd so you'd got a map had you? had
A	no we didn't have a map all we had was an address
B	the address
A	all we had was the address
B	but I mean there's so many roads up there
A	Benijófar Benimar three Alicante something or other
B	I don't know how you did how did you get to the place?
A	I don't even know how we got in the area
B	no
A	so how the hell are we meant to actually find where he is so
B	but if you hadn't er done that er gone up the streets just shouting everyone's name if there hadn't been a neighbour that heard you
A	mm
B	you could have just bypassed his street you could have been in the right area and not actually got hold of them
A	and we'd have ended well just
B	you
A	sleeping on the curb around there
B	oh
A	cos there was no beaches around there or anything
B	no
A	so I don't know where we'd have slept after that
B	no
A	cos it was getting dark as well
B	oh thank god they did
A	we did basically just hitchhike across Europe didn't we?
B	oh I know
A	we were jumping trains and
B	do you look back on it now and think we were a kind of like a bit of idiots?
A	I mean no it was fun a part of me kind of would do it again
B	dangerous though
A	but yeah it was definitely dangerous erm
B	I'm so glad I was saying to
A	we got robbed five times
B	oh I know
B	and had the bloody rucksack slashed
A	yeah in our sleep tent stolen all our shit was lost
B	I do believe that when your time's up it's up you know you can have so many near misses and not not be gone
A	so you think mine's coming then?
B	no
A	I don't know you you're saying you have so many misses and
B	no no just no it's kind of like well you know sleeping with a rucksack and someone coming and slashing it and taking your stuff they could have just murdered you and taken your stuff
A	yeah that would have caused a lot more I mean perhaps if we'd have woken up in the in the midst of happening
B	oh don't don't I just
A	we did though there was one time we woke up or the police woke us up shining torches at us
B	oh my god
A	and they had like three Moroccans like pretty I mean they weren't in handcuffs but they had them like there around us so they they'd caught them
B	oh my god so they were they'd watched them coming towards you?
A	yeah they caught them caught them doing it to us
B	oh god
A	yeah it scared us a couple of times there was one instance where we couldn't find anywhere to sleep
B	mm
A	smashed this guy round the head with a bottle and we're like
B	I hate stuff like that I can't bear it
A	er I'm not staying around here so we kind of like went for a walk walked as far along the coast we must have walked for an hour or two and then it got really sketchy the further away we got from the beach there was an old abandoned train carriage like on the beach
B	oh my god
A	there was an
B	oh god
A	suddenly like this Moroccan guy just on his own just walked out of the this abandoned creepy house
B	oh my god
A	and was telling us to come in there and to come and sleep in there and
A	I'm not I'm not going in there like this the
B	no wonder
B	no wonder he got comfy
A	well we stayed for a few days didn't we?
B	yeah I know but you wanted to get back on your travels didn't you and
A	yeah
A	was did was
B	yeah that's what you said to me yeah you said
A	yeah maybe
B	you were the one that was pushing to get going
A	I don't remember it that clearly
B	and I think maybe
B	but
A	I don't even know why I did it to tell you honestly because I it's not like I was close with
B	no no it was early days wasn't it?
A	and like yeah really early
B	I think we'd just kind of said look if you're around that way and you need a safe base
A	yeah
B	they live out there
A	I don't know why I did it yeah no me too but I don't know I did
B	because if you look if you look back on it that kind of gave you your own connection with them
A	mm oh yeah
B	very early on
A	randomly completely randomly
B	I know I know and I think they were really touched as well that you did go to them so
A	mm I think we were just in a situation at that point where we were like we need somebody
B	yeah yeah
A	I need someone here
B	god and I'm so glad you found them
A	I'd be oh ridiculous
B	yeah
A	taught us a lot though didn't it though
B	yeah
A	about travelling and I haven't made those mistakes again
B	yeah he's not going to be travelling again is he?
A	did I say? he's not invited me or anything to his wedding
B	really?
A	yeah
B	and he knows you're home?
A	yeah he knows I'm home but I don't know if he's just I'm was I'm not hurt I guess I it's just made me realise the longer I've been away now the
B	mm
A	and they're not going to travel to meet me
B	mm mm
A	then there's a part of me that thinks what's the point in trying to keep these friendships going
B	you have friends for different reasons though don't you?
A	I mean if he's around whenever I'm around then I'll see him
B	mm mm
A	but like if he's not going to come out and visit me and I'm not going to be invited to his wedding and this kind of stuff then
B	mm
A	we're obviously not that close are we so
B	mm
A	and I've I've not known him now for a hell of a lot longer than I've actually known him so
B	but have you not kept in contact with Skype or or not Skype but emailed or anything?
A	no we haven't skyped and he he rarely emails and like
B	yeah
A	and I am going to you
B	yeah yeah
A	in England for the these are the type of people that will meet us
B	yeah
A	and er
B	I think
A	they will meet us in Africa and I just think
B	yeah
A	we're meeting a different class of friend now
B	yeah
A	a different
B	I think you just have to look at the friends that you meet along your journey for a reason at that time they were great friends and you got on this way or that way and then you meet another friend and it's kind of like
A	mm no definitely
B	I mean when I think of
A	the whole idea that you keep friends for the rest of your life is just not
B	yeah
A	it's not really that
B	I mean when I think of
A	no
B	do you know what I mean? and it's not like you know we weren't close it's been two years now since she's gone
A	yeah I know if I I thought that
B	crazy
A	before I came here and I couldn't believe it had been two
B	erm but it takes two in a friendship doesn't it as well
A	no absolutely
B	so
A	and as you said I'm sure you were closer at one point and then you drift
B	yeah yeah
A	and if she'd have lived longer maybe you'd have got closer again as well of course
B	yeah we would've done with
A	you you it goes in spurts doesn't it?
B	yeah and
A	so imagine how that is when you now add living in a different country to that mix
B	I know
A	yeah
B	I do miss having a close close friend I mean I've got
A	yeah
B	which is
B	but
A	I feel bad really that she's she is family but I've never really treated it her I mean I guess I think of her as family but
B	yeah
A	I haven't like so much treated her as family for a long time
B	well I don't know you were always pleased to see her when she's always here at functions and stuff isn't she so
A	yeah she feels like family
B	yeah definitely
A	I hope she thinks that though
B	yeah I think she does she's proud that she's your god-mum I know I couldn't remember who she as but she did mention something about god-son the other day so and I couldn't remember who it was I must look that up actually just to double-check for my own
