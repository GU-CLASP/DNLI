A	have a look at my ticket
B	have a look have a look at the ticket see what they're
C	my ticket for what?
B	steam fair
A	steam fair
C	oh my steam fair ticket is it the same as yours?
A	well it probably is but I wasn't I was gonna see how much mine was
C	yeah see how much it's saved doing it online
A	I don't think it saved anything to be honest
C	the great
C	oh yeah it doesn't it's not valid for any day in particular
A	no
C	I thought you went for a set day
A	no
C	I guess that yeah that'd be silly
A	mm
C	I mean I'm er I'm capable of looking after things but I can give it to mother
C	no exactly
A	mm
C	yeah I didn't wanna
A	sixteen fifty
C	exactly the same
B	sixteen fifty
C	so what did you did you get any discount er when you booked online? oh is that because dad's is older? so what was yours dad? fifteen pounds? cos you're an old age pensioner? yeah OAP oh wow they knock off a
A	no it's actually cost me more look the ticket was sixteen fifty dad's was fifteen and I paid two pound booking fee so mine come to thirty-three fifty
C	oh crikey and er
A	because I said it was nineteen something perhaps it is if you pay on the day
B	yeah
C	oh what? rather than buy an advance ticket?
A	yeah
C	shall I look it up and see what it says? great
A	so I've actually paid two pound
C	than I did
C	well I guess you've gotta pay for the postage haven't you? so
A	the booking fee yeah
C	to post them out to you but maybe yeah it's if you erm buying them on the day or not it might be different at the entrance mightn't it?
A	might be yeah
B	no I think it's dearer
A	well it said it was nineteen
B	mm
A	I think nineteen pound I think
B	well have a look on the laptop
A	for an adult ticket on the day
C	do you remember what you er oh it's a muddy start it's on BBC News one day ago erm do you remember what you paid last time you came down?
A	no
B	no that was seven years ago
C	yeah
A	was longer ago than that
A	eight years
B	mm
C	pardon you
C	it's all that erm don't know it's all the tea you drink or something isn't it mum?
A	probably
C	seeing what the prices are now oh yeah on the day it's twenty pounds
B	yeah?
C	but prepaid is sixteen pounds fifty
A	oh
C	but underneath it says in brackets on bookings before the thirteenth of August but I guess what they've done is issued prepaid tickets to the to all the
A	yeah
C	I guess oh on bookings before thirteenth of August
A	yeah so I thought you know we had to book it before then to get the but then they I got two pound added on to mine anyway so
C	you had to do it yeah
A	so you could say mine was eighteen fifty
C	still not twenty pounds and dad's would've been seventeen pounds so you still saved money than buying it on the day
A	yeah
C	which was the whole idea but not as cheap as walking in today and just getting one over the counter
C	disabled parking? probably
A	shall I keep it with mine now?
C	yeah you may as well sure you'll have to you'll have to use yours for erm entrance anyway hopefully it means we'll get in a bit quicker tomorrow
A	mm yeah hopefully yeah there should be a line I
C	yeah I guess it depends where they put you in the car what was the parking like last time?
B	well we parked right up the field
A	mm I parked quite a long way
B	quite a long a long long long way
A	well it wasn't long and
B	it was
A	long long long long
C	not not disabled friendly
B	it was about twenty er eh?
C	I'm sure there must be er I'm sure they must accommodate the disabled people
A	I'm sure they must yeah although
C	disabled access and camping I mean this is about camping
A	yeah
A	you would have a job pushing a wheelchair around but people were some people had them little erm
C	mm yeah
A	yeah buggy thing perhaps perhaps they've well I dunno wouldn't just be able to go there and operate one if you're not used to it would you?
C	mm
B	yeah I would
C	and then there's people that are
A	well yeah like your father
B	yeah
C	er I'm sure they have to make some sort of let's see what it says disabled access and camping don't know why they're under the same bracket see if the blue badge comes in handy
B	hopefully might get us a bit closer
C	mm
C	mm
B	no I mean it's huge this place easily get fucking lost if you ain't careful
C	I did mean to bring a little rucksack with me actually just to carry bits around for the day but
A	oh
C	didn't just got
B	might see one at the boot in the morning
C	I don't need one I've got rucksacks galore
B	mm
A	have a look in
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	just to carry around a bigger bottle of water and stuff cos
A	well I didn't bring the little bottle
C	well I need er at least a bottle that size it's gonna last not very long is it?
A	mm
C	they always rip you off for water in those types of places don't they? and you say there's plenty of food?
B	oh yeah
A	yeah
B	massive
A	yeah there's big food big marquees and doing food as well as the you know the vans that do it and
B	marquees
C	oh yeah
B	you ain't seen nothing like it I'm telling you
A	no
C	we might have to
A	well
B	you've only you've only
A	we
B	yeah
A	in there last time
A	could you remember what we? oh that's
A	I can't remember what we had to eat
B	cup of tea and they've got big spits going there and all with the grub on cutting it off fresh
A	hog roast maybe?
B	yeah yeah
C	what? a hog roast?
B	you see them all cutting it off
C	oh you get that at fairs in erm
C	yeah keep him calm see
A	does it?
C	but it says it's talking about the reason it says disabled access and camping is because it's talking about disabled people that are camping
A	mm
C	not actually
A	see a lot of people come and camp for the
B	yeah
C	mm
B	they pay but I mean if they're there they're there ain't they?
C	yeah
B	there's like two or three days
A	well the the stall holders I expect that they camp there don't they?
B	yeah
C	yeah I mean they must still be in caravans and stuff mustn't they?
A	mm
C	self contained something or other
A	well I'm getting to feel quite peckish
C	mm well isn't and we're not in the least bit hungry she said over and over again
A	well I wasn't
B	that's what I that's that's what I like to hear
A	it's when I kept burping
C	yeah you just need to get a bit of trapped wind out
C	ask?
B	ask about parking
C	doesn't ask it doesn't I mean it doesn't clarify about disabled parking
B	well then ask about parking normal
C	no it doesn't ask about parking oh what do you mean ask? I'm not asking
B	well there must be something that you can click on
C	has information yeah well I actually surprisingly isn't providing me with very good information what time do the car parks open? is there local transport? blah blah blah visitor information
B	what time does it open?
C	what? the car parks?
B	yeah
C	don't know let me click on that seven A M
B	no I don't think we'll be that early
C	no I mean we'll be going to the other boot fair first won't we?
B	we are darling
A	what time does it open?
B	seven
C	well if the car park's open at seven then
A	doesn't necessarily mean that opens at seven though I wouldn't have thought
C	no I mean depends what you go to I mean the stalls might start opening
A	mm
C	I mean it must open shortly after that they don't want people parking in the car park and then not doing anything for two hours do they?
A	I dunno if it was the dog or the cat
B	dog moaning at the cat go away leave her alone
A	oh don't you not think she's used to it?
C	can't seem to it's kind of annoying
A	they are used to each other dear they live with each other you don't have to tell him to leave him alone she'll give him a swipe when she's had enough
C	yeah cats tend to dominate dogs don't they?
A	yeah definitely
C	what's that? oh is that the cat flap going?
A	mm
C	was this extension
B	no
A	no they'd what? the erm conservatory?
C	yeah
A	no they had that built when they first moved here
C	oh did they?
A	mm
C	kind of necessary isn't it? gives a nice big space
A	mm
C	and go outside got a conservatory already on your house haven't you?
A	well ours is an extension isn't it? it's not a conservatory
C	oh yeah of course it is which again is a nice feature
A	mm
C	couldn't do without it could you?
A	no not not when you've had one you know when you've had it
C	mm
A	from the beginning
B	wonder what the house is worth now
A	yeah
A	well if it goes down everything else goes down with it
B	yeah
A	one nine two
B	mm
C	one nine two
A	I think it was one nine two
B	might've been a little bit more
A	one nine four
B	yeah
A	something like that
C	so I mean did the property prices drop in the recession and then come back up?
B	yeah yeah
A	yeah they they did drop a bit when we first moved in
C	cor bad time to have to sell isn't it?
B	I think it might've been even more yeah
C	but if you
B	that was the time to buy
A	the time to buy yeah
C	but then er er but then also it depends you know swings and roundabouts if you were looking to buy a property then you would've got it for cheaper even though you were selling yours for cheaper so it doesn't really matter does it?
A	mm
B	yeah yeah
A	no but but we we wouldn't've had to've spent so much on buying it cos we'd already sold ours hadn't we? yeah
C	you've
A	mm
C	and then eventually when it crawled back up you could've made a profit
A	mm
C	instead of losing twenty yeah you that would've given you an extra twenty thousand pounds to play with
A	mm
C	it's a shame isn't it?
B	it did
A	well I don't think they did
A	they never really dropped too much in our area they they might've dropped it
A	it might've dropped about ten at the most
B	it did
A	oh shut up you
B	it did
A	you don't know
A	in fact
C	keeps making itself jump in the lampshade bag
A	in fact I'm not even sure if it dropped at all
A	because we you know we put the garage and that on
B	yeah
C	why was it worth so much without the garage
A	well it's it's because it's yeah
B	the area
C	it's the area
A	no no
A	no it was never er council round there it's never it's always been a private estate
C	yeah
A	that makes a difference
C	yeah I imagine it does
C	I imagine it does although there's no reason really for it to make a difference is there? depends on it's depends on the
B	I mean a garage now should
C	why do they like these lampshades so much?
A	are they your lampshades they're playing with?
C	yeah they just keep trying to get in it
B	yeah
C	yeah that's a good point they cost me one pound fifty they're alright though aren't they? blue and white one in the living room one in the bedroom help with the darkness of it all we had to turn cos
C	but erm
B	mm
C	that's why we went to bed so early
A	yeah
C	he just he er had an awful headache
A	did he?
C	stress of moving
A	mm
B	stress of moving
B	mm
C	like I said he kind of took charge of that which was good
A	who?
C	cos I don't think yeah he needed to cos coming up the stairs with that stuff like the futon almost didn't make it I don't know how they really did it they just kind of bit of force and kept shuffling it cos it completely was the
B	I'd have got it down there easy
A	mm
C	but erm
B	did you do the garden?
C	no I dunno how it'll go with him and his dad on er and his brother

C	before you go out for dinner?
B	are you going to the bathroom first?

C	well he wasn't too he had some
C	and he wore that shirt with some other dirty trousers to move stuff his combat stuff he wore which were marked but he said well I'm only moving furniture which is a good point I'm sure
A	what did

A	mm
C	joggers and a T shirt or something
C	was he wearing joggers or jeans? he might've been in jeans
