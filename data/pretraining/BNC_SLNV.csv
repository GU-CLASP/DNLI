B	I know I'm not sure
A	nice groovy background music for the people doing the transcripts
B	I don't know how they'll feel about it but
A	I'm sure it'll be okay cool so
B	yeah so obviously
A	yeah
B	he's just very very sweet er
A	there's a
A	I think she just started she came late to the class
B	mm mm mm mm
A	and on the other side of the table there's naughty boy who used to wear always wear the sweatshirt saying do I give a fuck? or something like that
B	is he the one with the
A	oh crumbs erm quite a chunky young man
B	uhu
A	or maybe you would I don't know but er he used to sit next to and mess around a little bit with another young woman whose name I also can't remember she was a little bit emo
B	I don't know I don't think I met
A	no yeah
B	confident and very sure of themselves very good at English and some just so shy
A	yeah
B	and I can I can understand it but
A	what were you doing with them? was it speaking exams?
B	speaking exams no the actual speaking
A	oh the actual mock okay
B	erm
B	yeah he yeah I could tell
A	yeah
B	erm
A	oh dear
B	and if they don't look at each other in the eye when they're talking or it doesn't seem kind of genuine and they're going so what do you think? yes well I like you know like robots
A	yeah
B	erm they get marked down for it they've got to be like normal people having a conversation
A	yeah
B	erm and like I know the stress affects them but you can tell like when they get on well anyway outside of class but in the exam they can be with anyone
A	aha
B	yeah
A	in a strange environment I wonder if part of the shyness is a worry about being judged by people that they know
B	yep
A	yeah
B	than the other person so
A	yeah good they're nice group
B	I was with
B	and there's this bit in the exam where it's just silence for like fifteen seconds while they read whatever they're reading
A	yeah
B	er and it was at that point every single group of people that her stomach would start and she would be like oh I'm so sorry I was like he he he
B	oh it was just so funny ha ha ha
A	you need to keep some emergency oatcakes or a banana in your pocket for them her
B	yeah
A	feed this woman
B	I was like do you have any food?
B	and she'd like brought back like two biscuits I was like mm
A	ah
A	ha
B	I didn't even know what I expected her to do
A	just pop down Maccy D's
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	oh dear
A	oh well
A	and how was
B	no she's not
A	yeah
B	but somehow these are sort of erm the lesser of two evils and I thought oh well that's telling unless like she just voted for something completely different
A	yeah
B	erm away from these two parties
A	yeah most of my students have pretty much said with the election that there's just no choice
B	mm mm
A	do you want you know which of well which of the two evils there is no party that they would vote in
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	holy fuck
B	yeah
A	wow
B	and I was like but he was like but it's okay cos we get along in the house we're not sort of arguing all the time
A	yeah
B	I was like I was like oh my god well that's sort of like
A	wow
A	wow
B	I just sort of can't look at him properly and like how I
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	which really shocked and surprised me
B	my two of my closest friends
A	what?
B	they're like we're left no but but I don't agree with the sort of welfare side of things
A	oh my god
B	it's like what are you talking about?
A	yeah
B	so and
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	yeah yeah yeah and the same people
A	yeah
B	and you know when I was on Twitter on the election er night or the night of the elections and all these exit poles my whole stream was people going oh my god what's happening? I can't believe that this de de de de
A	yeah yeah
B	erm
A	yeah my family sorry and
B	yeah so I was like these people do exist in our society I just don't know them
A	it just makes you think you know there's a whole other Facebook newsfeed out there that's full of this oh David Cameron oh Jeremy Hunt hooray
B	yeah
A	I know
B	it's rather worrying all my friends were out
A	good for them
B	yeah
A	oh I do like a good march
B	oh I do like a good march
A	oh I do I do like a good banner wave
B	yeah
A	ah
B	so my friend was like weighed down with like twenty pizzas
B	you know it was just sort of
A	that's sweet
B	yeah it was good
A	mm
B	but I read something the other day that oh no it's not in it's in like trust hospitals or foundation hospitals they can decide whether to implement the new contract or not
A	yeah
B	and I was thinking about this if they all move abroad it means they won't have to pay their student fees so that's fifty thousand pounds per doctor er per person who's graduated in the last few years who just won't pay back their fees
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	I'm not paying my fees back er but I've not been kind of forced out of country because er you know what I mean
A	yeah
B	er twenty-five years
A	twenty-five years hey that's not bad
B	I think so I think it's
A	yeah
B	we're we're taught this erm
A	yeah
B	if you're out of the country for twenty-five years they wipe it
A	yeah yeah that's cool handy hint for you though if you think you might want a UK pension you can ring the tax office every year and say how much do I owe you in national insurance contributions?
B	mm mm
A	and it's a few hundred quid a year I can't remember the figure I did I was a year short er more than a decade ago and I think I had to pay seven hundred quid and that was that year with a tick in a box
B	mm mm
A	I mean there are no guarantees of course I think you needed something like twenty-five qualifying years to be able to draw a pension but that's as things stand today
B	mm mm
A	the government by the time I retire might have decided to do away with pensions entirely you never know so
B	yeah erm
A	mm
B	erm and it is quite a lot of national insurance and it's quite a lot of tax but I can get the tax back
A	yeah it won't be enough for the year
B	er
A	but yeah it's just something worth considering you might want to sort of factor it into your annual budgetary equations
B	mm
A	yeah
B	but it was you know it was just such a shock and then he started a sentence that was something like oh I just don't get that about gay marriage and me and
B	no no no no no no
A	oh
B	he's like I just don't believe that people you know are so against it and I was like thank fuck for that I was going to have to kick you out and go to Mrs
A	oh my god
B	I can't live with this man I'm sorry
A	yeah
B	we were like er this was sort of after the UKIP
A	yeah mind you David Cameron voted for equal marriage
B	mm mm
A	with er the DUP vetoing it all the Stormont executive has said yes let's have equal marriage and the DUP er have this petition of concern
B	mm
A	which is a a legal thing that they can use to block legislation from being passed if they believe that it's gonna unfairly disadvantage either the Protestant community or the Catholic community so they've used it
B	mm mm
A	I do wonder you know if it does come in if my legal rights of marriage
B	mm mm
A	so I don't have equal rights you know financially and that's going to affect me in later life even if it doesn't now but I wonder if that might get sort of wiped out
B	uhu
A	I suppose once it eventually goes through I need to be asking that question
B	mm mm
A	yeah
B	it's too hot to drink that's the problem
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	air?
B	I was thinking yeah I need to get out of the house
A	mm
B	yeah
B	you know it's been better today I took the I took the rubbish out and then I was like fuck that was a bad idea
A	good
B	erm but
A	yeah
B	it well I suppose it should be doing
A	and have you noticed how clean
B	she's very clean I hadn't noticed but she's clean
A	yeah
B	mm mm
A	and I have no idea what they all say
A	I mean there's there's a certain amount of potential for that I'm not sure so when I'm over in England in March for the pre MOT checks and things I'll get an opinion of an expert and we'll see
B	oh no
A	I know I'm not sure though because
A	no then I rubbed bits with my hand and then the streaks disappeared and everything went whiter
B	mm mm
A	so I wonder if you know the the super heated soapy jet wash of number two gets a certain level of shit off of it and then I need to actually rub with a sponge or something to get the next layer of cack off
B	right
A	I don't know
B	but it was easy to do?
A	yeah really easy to do cost about ten zlotys about a pound seventy-five something like that
B	mm mm
A	and I was there for fifteen minutes with the various
B	mm mm
A	jets number two and number three so yeah it went very well so I'll do that again and I think any future wash will only cost about five so I should do it in half the time
B	yeah
A	yeah it's good
B	good for you
A	yeah so I'm writing out my itinerary at the moment and erm checking with various people that it's okay to stay on whatever dates
B	mm mm
A	erm
B	right
A	so
B	mm mm
A	but if I have her tested on the sixteenth of March or after then the certificate is still valid to sixteenth of April next year
B	ah ha okay
A	so it's a naughty way of getting thirteen months I suppose
B	mm mm mm
A	erm
B	mm mm
A	so
B	oh no
A	oh shit so my uncle wasn't there he was working late last night he's the one he'll say oh yes mate whatever you need no no worries but my aunty's I don't know I think she's quite stressed because her youngest son and his wife who both have fairly severe disabilities have been staying with them for the past few months
B	mm mm
A	she's pushing seventy and she's just stressed out a lot of the time so I think anybody asking anything of her
B	mm mm
A	yeah
B	mm mm
A	so I dunno
B	mm mm
A	it will fit in the spare room and all go away in drawers wardrobe cupboards
B	mm mm
A	I mean easily it's not like boxes everywhere erm
B	mm mm
A	I'm keeping some stuff to travel with giving a load of stuff away I'm ready to let go of now it's not really that much so
B	mm mm
A	yeah
B	good for you
A	and I've been on the work away website and the help X website I'm getting really really really really excited
B	so what's how's the what's the plan today?
A	well
B	as it stands
A	there's actually there's a place in Portugal where
B	mm mm
A	I think erm they they're looking for people from I think it's mid April to December
B	ah ha
A	they accept people and I I don't know I kind of get the feeling I could go live with them for the whole duration
B	mm mm
A	but
B	mm mm
A	and then there are some Poland projects I really like the look of as well
B	mm mm
A	erm one of them has they look like
B	ah
B	uhu
A	you know a bit bigger than that and a bit more grown up looking than that I suppose a bit more horsey looking than that but erm yeah they got twenty of them and part of the job obviously will be shovelling shit
B	cute
A	and I think in the profile they talk about shovelling shit or clearing shit and thought ah that's honest I like that
B	mm mm
A	erm but you'd also have an opportunity to learn to ride and they talk about erm cos they're all hippies being in kind of being one with the horse and learning how like
A	yeah ride in a horse sensitive kind of a way
B	well that's nice
A	so that might be a wonderful opportunity
B	yeah be really nice
A	yeah haven't found much with bees
B	mm mm
A	I am keen to learn about bees there's lots on biodynamic farming and organic farming and permaculture so I'm not going to have problems there
B	mm mm
A	and I'm thinking if I'm driving form Poland to Portugal surely it makes sense to stay in some projects in Czech Republic in Austria
B	nice
A	and maybe Italy in France in Spain before I get down to Portugal
B	oh
A	so I'm thinking maybe I'll just do like a month or six weeks in Poland and then maybe you know a month Czech Republic a month Austria a month Spain and then get down to Portugal and kind of bed in there for winter I don't know
B	nice
A	there's projects everywhere it's amazing can't believe I've never discovered this world before
B	mm mm
A	in they can be having a traditional whatever meal with that mum or grandma's cooked and be at the table with the whole family and other volunteers so it's exciting can't wait really
B	good for you
A	mm
B	it's nice
A	I think to each their own you know I think some people
B	mm mm
A	and she's a home maker and she's been put sending me Whatsapp pictures of she's bought a new sofa and a new coffee table and a new TV unit and new net curtains and asks me my opinion on does this knick knack go well in this window with these curtains? I mean as if I have an opinion
B	mm mm
B	mm mm
A	and yeah so
B	yeah
A	and for me I love wandering and I love finding out about people and about their culture
B	mm mm
A	and learning new skills when I'm going about it and there's no right or wrong it's just different
B	mm m mm mm yeah
B	mm mm
A	my plans sort of step by step whereas I think with her and her son it's just a case of he's going and she doesn't know
B	where he'll be
A	yeah she doesn't know the detail of what he's up to and who he's meeting and how safe he is
B	no no no
A	navigated that slope quite successfully
B	oh
A	well I don't want another coffee cos that was a bit rank I'm surprised at that I'm sure we had a nicer one before
B	and it was the same girl
A	anyway
B	mm mm
A	cor you're so observant
B	yes the skinny brown haired rather pretty one yes
B	mm
A	mm
B	erm
A	if you want to write a list and then sit where you're sitting I'll run into Lidl and get a few bits
B	oh no no no
A	don't forget you can use your trolley as a Zimmer frame
B	this isn't like the problems of two three weeks ago when I didn't have legs but I had an upper body
A	I know
B	this week I seem to not have an upper body but I do have the legs the legs are fine
A	you have no lungs
B	yeah
A	yeah well the no lungs could potentially kill you
B	yeah I know
A	whereas the no legs you just
B	it was it was more painful though it was more painful
A	mm
B	whereas this is kind of just sort of frightening
A	oh yes USA Netflix
B	yes
A	more joys to behold they've got
B	oh have they? I've not seen any Mission Impossible ever in my whole life no
A	have you not?
B	mm mm
A	I've seen none of those
B	oh
A	they've got all of the Matrix films
B	mm mm
A	and I I got number one completely number two lost me about half way through and I didn't get number three so I'd like to have a little
B	mm mm
A	erm
B	mm mm
A	they've got the Bletchley something or others
B	circle
A	Bletchley Circle did you see that?
B	no
A	it was excellent erm strong female leads
B	mm mm
A	so you'd probably enjoy that bit of girl power going on yeah which reminds me Happy Valley
B	yeah
A	I mean great but it's not very happy is it?
B	well no I know er but
B	yes
A	while they're sat outside smoking fags and she's relaying the story about the goat
B	I know I really enjoyed
A	yeah
B	I really enjoyed it er
A	yeah I know
B	erm
A	I think the twist to this one will be a woman done it it'll probably be the woman who was Moaning Myrtle
B	mm mm
A	yeah
B	erm
A	mm
B	stop attacking people please
A	yeah
B	mm mm
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	and teaching parents to be afraid and a lot of that's you know it's nonsense
B	mm mm
A	statistically what's the probability of you know a paedophile attacking your child or
B	mm mm
A	erm a rapist attacking your daughter I mean statistically it's tiny but the fear can be enormous
B	mm mm but
A	yeah
B	it's tiny
A	yeah
B	but if it's like erm going home with someone on a night out
A	yeah and you've had too much to drink and whatever yeah
B	yeah that's
A	that's more likely
B	way more likely so there sort of needs to be some education for both young men and women
A	mm yes
B	the tea thing
A	yeah
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	on tea
B	yeah
A	yeah and if a woman you've gone home with is too drunk to agree to cup of tea she doesn't want tea
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	well I read this
A	I like that
B	I read this book about
A	mm
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	yeah
B	no
A	yeah
B	I don't know
A	look at all the birds on the lamppost they've all paired off
B	ah
A	they're quite close next lamppost above
B	uhu
A	lamppost further over they're a mile apart I don't think they're talking
B	strange isn't it?
A	mm
A	the life of
B	no it's okay no it's okay anyway right plan plan
A	so let's do something
B	I don't know what it's just
A	would you like another beverage somewhere to be out and to
A	be that consumer society or otherwise
B	you're really selling it to me
A	oh I know
B	I don't know where we can go though
A	mm
B	that's not sort of in the city centre
A	mm we could just
B	mm mm
A	we can just go for a random drive see where we end up
B	yeah
A	let's do that will we?
B	yeah I'm just trying to think of this
A	basically it's just nice for you not to be in your flat for a little while
B	I know I just need a bit of
A	we could do a sort of head out west of
B	mm mm
A	and there are all sorts of little villages around there might end up on the motorway I don't know
B	mm mm
A	and then you can sort of come in to the south of
B	or we could go I don't know how far away it is
A	mm mm
B	and there's like that town
B	I know
A	and it's got a cute little square
B	mm mm
A	yeah
B	how far away is that is that too far?
A	erm no no not at all from here probably less than twenty K
B	I don't know is it Saturday afternoon? I don't know what'll be open probably nothing
A	yeah
B	mm
A	well we could go park in the square there's bound to be a coffee shop or something we could get a herbal something or not bother
B	mm mm
A	erm if you want you can even come to my house and have a green tea or a peppermint tea or whatever
A	yeah I haven't hoovered in a more than a week so the
B	I don't know dust balls?
A	dust things sort of dust balls yeah like in an old western movie
B	mm mm
A	kind of circling across my living room and hall but
B	mm
A	if you can put up with that then great
B	I will survive
A	yeah
B	erm
A	yeah I suppose I'm thinking about you and walking I mean we could
B	mm mm
A	do a circuit of
B	mm mm
A	which probably isn't so good and inside a shopping centre it's gonna be fake air
B	yeah
A	which won't be so good and then sunset will be in another
B	yeah mm mm
A	and once that happens it'll start getting cold quickly
A	that's enough take me home
B	erm erm
A	yeah but I'm happy enough to just drive aimlessly and see where we end up
B	mm mm
A	yeah
B	I'd like to go to a village
A	let's aim for
B	shall we try it?
A	erm yeah we can do a quick tour of the square and then a twenty minute drive back
B	oh it's a square congratulations it looks exactly like every square
A	hooray
B	yes okay is that okay? do you agree?
A	that's okay let me turn this thingy off so bye
B	oh yeah
