B	it usually it's only professors who do
A	yes
A	so you're not doing your
B	mm
B	more work
B	in Finland you have to do
A	what do you mean?
B	we've we've just appointed a new professor at
A	yeah
B	with with that kind of
A	yeah
B	you can barely get a normal
B	yeah
A	and
B	in Britain you have to have I think at least five books
A	oh right
B	it's usually a mix
A	yeah
B	a book
A	journals
B	of of three or five articles or something like that
A	yeah
B	plus
A	yeah
B	cos I want to actually do research
B	so
A	I hate admin
B	yeah
A	bloody boring
B	yeah
A	which? the admin?
B	admin
A	oh yeah
B	tell me about the last five years I'm sure you've got a lot to tell
A	oh gosh what's happened in the last five years? so where are we two thousand and fifteen?
B	anything you
A	what within my job you mean?
A	well
B	mm
A	diabetes and stuff
B	mm
A	so that's become more of of a a thing in the last five years
B	mm
A	erm
B	is that because?
A	I'm just trying to think
B	is that because of more obesity or?
A	well that yeah
B	mm
B	what's that?
A	fatty liver I mean
B	too much beer?
A	well no
A	but it can be obesity
B	mm
A	so non-alcoholic fatty liver disease
B	mm
A	but
B	that sounds scary
A	yeah
B	mm
A	cos the CCG's no more now
B	mm
A	there's not gonna be any more erm
B	mm
A	but it's with all
B	mm
A	the governments I mean
B	mm
A	changing and everything
B	mm mm
A	like an NHS federation
B	mm
A	which is just really like an old health authority
A	erm
B	mm
A	obesity preventing this
B	mm
A	preventing
B	yeah
A	blah di blah
A	but I think yeah I think the admin has got
B	mm
A	a bit worse actually erm
B	mm
A	applications so that'll be a lot better for freshers
B	mm
A	whether it'll work or not
B	mm
B	yeah
A	cos we have something like ten thousand
B	yeah
A	so they either
B	mm
A	mm
B	it's a bit like
A	yeah
B	so they come and then within the first couple of months they
A	yeah
B	mm
A	it a lot's changed but erm
B	mm
A	gone more nurse-led now so
B	mm
A	it's run by the nurses now not the doctors
B	mm
A	it's mostly run by us now
B	okay
A	so
B	so it's it stays in the profession
A	yeah
B	you probably like doctors even less now because you see so little of them
A	yeah
B	mm
A	probably cheaper than doctors aren't we I suppose?
B	yeah
A	you know we do a lot
B	mm
A	we can do like prescribing and stuff like that so
B	yeah
A	mm
B	and you want an appointment you get an appointment with a nurse
B	mm
A	so basically
B	mm
A	you can come in sit and wait
B	mm
A	so whereas like
B	mm
A	you'd have appointments for the doctors like you could just book
B	yeah
A	but now you come in and you you just sit and wait
B	mm
A	so that's the there's an impact really
B	mm
A	they're getting more
B	mm
A	dependent on you
B	yeah
A	cos you notice the students coming in
B	mm
A	so you create like
B	mm
A	they can just come in whenever they want
A	you know?
B	mm
A	yeah
B	mm
A	oh are you?
B	which is which is really
A	oh right
B	I don't know
A	yeah
B	B I'm not
A	yeah
B	erm
A	mm
B	and it just seems to be a lot of doctors and then of course a lot of interns
A	yeah
B	erm
A	yeah
B	I thought I don't understand him and I'm not quite sure whether he understands me
A	but you'd be more be able to understand them than anyone wouldn't you?
B	mm mm
A	see that's another
B	mm
A	thing as well you don't get the continuity
B	mm
A	so you don't see your
B	no
A	do you know what I mean which is not a good thing either
B	no
A	mm
B	but he wasn't my doctor but there was a female doctor and she was the one who was my
A	mm
B	within the practice
A	yeah
B	and it was only if
A	yeah
B	that we would see her
A	yeah
B	mm
A	and anyone with a long-term condition has gotta have their own doctor
B	that makes sense
A	so they kind of can request to see them but then again
B	yeah
A	do you know what I mean?
B	yeah
A	it doesn't really work
B	mm
A	say well
B	mm
A	I'll see you in two months they can book them in for two months do you know what I mean with them?
B	yeah
A	but that that's the the main thing that's happened
B	mm
A	and I mean
B	mm
A	god it's horrendous sometimes
B	yeah
A	flu
B	mm
A	and
B	mm
A	but I think
B	mm
A	like seven days a week don't they?
B	mm
A	for like seven days a week
B	are still ill seven days a week because
A	mm
B	there was always
A	yeah
B	that kind of service but you wouldn't have
A	yeah
B	I think it's it's just operations wasn't it?
A	yeah
B	mm
A	so say you were unwell
B	yeah
A	they would come out and see you at the weekend
B	yeah
A	erm
B	mm
A	cos we do quite a few late nights as well does your surgery do late nights?
B	mm
A	yeah
B	at least one where it's
A	yeah
B	later than usual
A	yeah
A	is it?
B	so
A	yeah
B	well but it's it's
A	yeah
B	I'm not ill enough
A	no
B	to know
A	but the thing is if you're working as well
B	mm
A	sometimes you can't get it in so
B	mm
A	it is good for people who work
B	yeah
A	but I just don't know how they're gonna
B	mm mm
A	there's no more funding for it at all
B	yeah
A	so I don't know whether I
B	mm
A	were gonna do it between them
B	mm mm
A	and the others kinda close
B	I think that's what they do on the
A	do
B	two or three walk-in centres
A	yeah
B	mm
B	mm
A	and the city centre that's all we've got here
B	yeah
A	down this end
B	cos
A	think
B	somewhere
A	the one in
B	okay
A	so that's only kids
B	mm
A	erm
B	mm mm
A	yeah
B	mm
A	but
B	mm
A	you have to go with the flow and
B	stop
A	but
B	mm
A	or the day after do you know what I mean so they're quite good like
B	yeah
A	I'd just ask one of the
A	I'd just ask one of the docs in work
B	yeah
A	so what do you think about that?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	it's the kind of strain that catches you
A	you had it
B	yeah
A	but also them all coming in
B	mm
A	you know but I think you do build up an immunity don't you?
B	yeah
A	I know I do
B	mm
A	that's usually when I get my sore throat
B	yeah when everybody else is fine
A	yeah
B	mm
A	but usually
B	yeah
A	erm
B	I think that's the same with teaching
A	mm
B	and
A	yeah
B	or something there or you know but I I just fell ill I hadn't
A	yeah
B	been
A	yeah
B	just not interested
A	yeah cos then you're not yeah
B	just want to sleep I
A	yeah
B	ruined it for me
B	it's
A	but you see the planes as well I don't think they're very healthy are they?
B	mm
A	all the planes
B	and every single seat was taken
A	oh right
B	so
A	Finnair
A	are they alright Finnair? are they like Ryanair?
B	well they they have become like Ryanair
A	have they?
B	er it's it's because
A	yeah
B	you used to get food now you
A	oh
B	you might not
A	yeah
B	anyway and
A	how far is it
B	the prices haven't gone down and now you pay extra for luggage
A	oh
B	and they said
B	and
A	yeah
B	you just say this is the lowest
A	yeah
B	and
A	how far is it from Finland to
B	it's over three thousand miles
A	is it?
B	so we fly
A	yeah
B	hundred seater
A	yeah
B	and then take one
A	oh right
B	no
A	oh
B	regardless of where you're going so I've got a colleague
A	oh right
B	who's teaching French his family is in
A	yeah
B	so he has to fly to
A	oh god
B	yeah
A	yeah two flights
B	obviously getting to the airport and back
A	yeah
B	and he's
B	at uni
A	oh god
B	there's no
A	yeah
B	so again yeah you
A	is it dear is it dear in
B	everything is
A	expensive?
B	mm
A	so it's a bit like Sweden and?
B	yeah
A	oh do they?
B	anything that does
A	interesting
B	this is why they don't smile
B	ridiculously a Lidl is everywhere and you know well
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	so twenty-four percent in Finland
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	god
B	ice cream is ridiculously expensive unless you get it in a supermarket that's but you know you you go out
A	mm
B	is three euros so you think
A	yeah
B	but
A	yeah
B	you shouldn't be paying two pounds thirty for a cone
A	yeah
B	it's cheap
A	oh it's cheap Germany now?
B	oh yeah
A	it's about the same as here is it?
B	food and beer of course it's probably even cheaper than here
A	is it?
B	mm
A	oh right
B	yeah
A	cos they said that food had gone down here but I couldn't see it to be honest
B	yeah that's
A	I couldn't see it
B	that's what I wondered they said that in Finland as well it's like well
A	no
B	it must be the kind of food that I didn't buy
A	I know but you know
A	do you know what I mean?
B	crumpets went up by five to ten pence every week
A	yeah and cereal went up
B	yeah
A	really high didn't it?
B	yeah and it was
A	cos our two they do they go through cereal like there's no tomorrow
B	yeah
A	and I notice god twenty P each week or
B	yeah
A	what was the other things that was going up? things like pasta and rice went up
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	which
A	and they were saying oh yeah it's gone down
B	yeah
A	no it hasn't
B	it hasn't it hasn't gone up even further than that
A	no
B	yeah
A	but be interesting to see what
B	mm
A	interesting thing he's gonna do tomorrow in this budget isn't it tomorrow?
B	yeah
A	load of rubbish
B	everybody will be cut down
A	mm
B	it's
A	imagine bringing up all them kids man
B	it's
A	can't do it
B	it's the only ambition that that I've heard
A	yeah
B	them having and it's like
B	it's
A	yeah it's not you don't wanna get into a deep conversation with them
B	yeah
A	I just got nothing in common with them
B	no it's
A	how can you wanna be?
B	mm
A	like that?
B	no
A	cos even I
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	and she said they probably haven't even been to the city centre all they seem to do is
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	whatever
A	oh I don't oh no I don't know
B	what a life isn't it? they are behaving like kids and they're not much older because I can remember when he was a teenager
A	oh can you? where did he used to live? round here?
B	don't know but
A	was he?
B	but not a diamond and he
B	got in this
A	yeah
B	drunk he was in this fight and he can't have been older than say sixteen seventeen and I
A	was he?
B	I thought if that was then that's pretty
A	I think they look a lot older than what they are
B	he's got no teeth
A	he's got no teeth? oh do you know? oh god
B	yeah
A	but I bet you they're a lot older they're a lot younger than what we think they are
B	but I don't think they're very old
A	with their looks
B	no it's like
A	oh
B	but her mum doesn't live far
A	does she did mum live with the grandad?
B	don't know
B	but I know
A	oh he's alright
B	yeah
A	that's her grandad yeah
B	yeah so
A	well he's eighty-seven
B	yeah but
A	yeah
B	type
A	well the mother must be about fifty odd must she?
B	yeah
A	sixty maybe
B	yeah
B	it's
A	sometimes
B	mm
A	and
B	without shoes and then getting
A	put shoes on them I mean they could be walking in anything
B	yeah
A	but I remember
B	yeah
A	and he got a grip of the one down there and told him
B	mm
A	they weren't even bothered
B	mm
A	the children are are like down the
B	mm
A	she's right in the front
B	yeah
A	how can you watch a child like that?
B	I mean this is this
A	yeah
B	and they don't care
A	yeah
B	doesn't matter if they don't care they can't break quickly enough
A	but they wouldn't see her anyway she's only about that big
B	mm
A	they would not
B	yeah
A	but erm
B	no it's
A	yeah
B	so I think there
A	it is the jinxed house isn't it?
B	it's
A	oh yeah that was terrible that
B	this old
A	right
B	so it still didn't work because it just covered
A	the bit oh right
B	the credit she had
A	oh god
B	and she didn't last long
A	and where was the son? was he did he live in England or? cos she was like Indian wasn't she?
B	they didn't I think they only lived a couple of roads away
A	that was awful that
B	she could barely speak English so we we could
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	oh were they?
A	oh the baby again?
B	he no he no he was outside I think and he was shouting erm
B	lunchtime
A	yeah
A	and
B	well
A	yeah
B	I
A	what was he doing outside?
B	and he
A	was he out? was he out all night or something was he then maybe?
B	I don't know
B	rather than getting a second key
A	for god's sake
B	mm
A	but they will I you know what I just think they haven't got any common sense whatsoever
B	no
A	it's just they don't use their brain
B	this is just
A	I'm entitled to it
B	so you do
B	yeah
A	but you see
B	yeah
A	so if the mum and dad or the mum
B	mm
A	benefits they're gonna be on benefits aren't they?
B	yeah
A	it's terrible
B	yeah
A	I just feel sorry for them
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	the tough ones
A	yeah
B	and
A	is that is if
B	cos
A	if is that if they're quite bright the children? is that if they?
B	I don't
A	oh was that for everyone?
B	problems problem families
A	mm
B	yeah
A	oh right
B	educational
A	yeah
B	and then yeah basically you're getting some money because clearly nobody showed them
A	so parenting skills and stuff like that and
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	and who's
A	yeah
B	sort of taking a lot of stuff off your neck
A	but you see if they haven't got
B	no
A	yeah
B	you would have somebody who's like state appointed
A	yeah
B	which which must've worked because they
A	mm
B	it's yeah
B	if you
A	I mean this government and
B	yeah
B	well this is
A	oh I was made up with that
B	yeah
A	that's
B	I spoke to Ann Widdecombe
A	did you?
B	she was there and
A	oh was she there was she?
B	she she's little old lady I
A	yeah
B	old witch and
A	yeah
B	and then when I
A	mm
B	and she didn't even have a brolly
A	oh right?
B	and you're like former Minister of the Crown you know if we have anybody who's prominent on the Labour party side
A	yeah
B	they'll be in a group
A	yeah
B	she was there with her clipboard
B	horrible
A	that Esther McVey though ooh
B	yeah
A	oh I didn't like her at all
B	yeah I think Margaret Greenwood she is a GP isn't she?
A	is she the one who was who took her place?
B	yeah
A	oh is she?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	Luciana Berger is big on that but
A	yeah
B	fire
A	oh yeah
B	cos they
A	yeah
A	and all of them have to go yeah
B	yeah
A	but also they they they're working as well till they're
B	mm
A	what
B	yeah
A	sixty-two or something?
B	just like they have to be fantastically fit
A	but how you gonna get
B	well you get the odd ones
A	but not on average are you?
B	no
B	plus of course it's it's the same it's it's like if you do Labour rather than
B	apparently his his one job was folding tablecloths that's the one job he's ever done
B	yeah
A	oh he's he's quite privileged then isn't he?
B	he's
A	they all are even
B	yeah
A	it it
B	he only he only has to make sure that thirty-five
B	he's a distant cousin of the queen
A	who David Cameron?
B	yeah
B	so he's thirty-sixth in line to the throne
A	so he's still got a claim to the throne even though he was
B	yeah
A	oh right?
B	so funnily enough that
A	mm
B	and the circles the queen is in
A	mm
A	I know
B	mm
A	I thought Labour would've got in but
B	yeah
A	that's where the problem is where they're voting where they don't vote
B	yeah but a lot more people have voted and of course
A	yeah
B	here in
A	yeah
B	yes we got the votes but in the wrong places so
A	you needed to take away the votes didn't you?
B	yeah
A	from like
B	yeah
A	Conservative and stuff
B	but
A	yeah
B	if you look at the total votes
A	yeah
B	erm
B	just in the wrong places
A	mm
B	so
A	who do you think
B	I've got no idea I've got
A	well you get a vote anyway don't you if you're a member of the Labour Party?
B	well I I I
A	oh did you?
B	because I thought it's a bit pointless so I've rejoined now
A	yeah
B	but
A	so why would they go into arts?
B	well it's
A	she wants it to go where does she want it to go?
B	because
A	into public spending?
B	in
A	no I don't agree with that at all do you?
B	obviously not so I mean Liz Kendall was never my favourite but you know she
A	it's
B	I think
A	yeah
B	but it wasn't like we
A	I know
B	it was just like well we do it broader rather than just
A	yeah
B	and they
A	mm
B	and
A	yeah
B	and you know it has worked because
B	the twenty twelve Olympics how well was it then?
A	yeah
B	so that worked but
A	erm
B	yeah he he is a Liverpudlian
A	yeah
B	who just has to happen to
A	yeah
B	but
A	oh did he?
B	yeah but
A	there was a few what were those few lads that were really good and then they didn't wanna go for the running what was it? one of them was in the army?
B	the the guy who
A	I liked
B	and then suddenly
A	but I liked him yeah he seemed quite erm
B	but he must've thought yeah I've seen what they've done to Ed Miliband do I want my family to be under that kind of pressure?
A	yeah
B	yeah
B	do I really want to? you know?
A	I mean they just took the mickey out of him in the end I think didn't they?
B	yeah
A	I just didn't like him though and I mean I'd never vote Conservative
B	mm
A	but I just didn't think he was strong enough
B	well that was that was that was the issue that everybody
A	and that's the reason
B	it's
A	yeah
B	and
B	and there were lots of people who thought oh yeah Labour just had it because of the Winter of Discontent blah blah blah
A	yeah
B	and then
A	yeah
B	last time in their lives
A	mm
B	I don't know
B	yeah
A	yeah
A	mm
B	I just hope the budget will be an omnishambles
A	oh well well they're getting rid of the inheritance tax and we know who that's for don't we?
B	yeah I mean er
A	toffs
B	a million pounds worth
A	yeah
B	and you know you think like yeah that works
A	I suppose they've worked for it
B	well I know somebody and their house is
A	yeah
B	you know in the south
A	yeah
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	but I think well do you know what they've worked for that house they've paid for it
B	mm
A	you know
B	mm
A	so why should it be taxed?
B	mm
A	yeah
B	I mean it's it's
A	yeah
B	it's not so much that okay we pass it on to the children it's the trouble is that
A	yeah
B	and what about the people who could not even save up to have a deposit?
A	yeah
B	so you know it it just goes apart
A	yeah
B	and you think like well
A	yeah
B	you you can be intelligent about it because that's what
A	yeah
B	Paul McCartney did he said well
A	yeah
B	I'm not gonna give my
A	yeah
B	you know they they have set allowance and
A	yeah
B	eventually they will get a lot
A	yeah
B	but
A	eventually yeah but
B	well they've got the name anyway
A	yeah
B	they they're not gonna
A	and she's in her own right isn't she?
B	yeah
A	but erm
B	mm
A	he's gonna spend it all
B	super healthy living
A	oh yoga and all that palaver
B	yeah
A	mm
B	but you know for everybody else I think that's that's still just a tiny sliver of the population
A	yeah
B	you think like yeah you put a thousand pounds into the bank and by the time they go in to do university or finish school
A	yeah
B	that'll be
A	a nice little pot for when they go and get a car or whatever
B	yeah
A	no
B	and
A	mm
B	too socialist
A	yeah
B	mm
A	in Natwest or something
B	mm
A	so you could change that if you wanted to
B	yeah
A	they're all crap
