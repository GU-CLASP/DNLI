A	okay erm you know fine yeah give that a go
B	mm
A	and see
B	and and and that might not be directly connected to what we're trying to do but but the mechanism of the things you learn in doing that are certainly of value
A	alright
B	yeah?
A	erm okay now you you really really really can't get upset when I say what I'm about to say to you okay?
B	er
A	no I know you're not and I never asked you to
B	mm
A	but I think we have to set quite a strong objective now
B	yeah and and I mean timewise this is what my driver is is that timewise erm when when
B	yes of course
A	okay?
B	yeah
A	and how long that capital's gonna last am I gonna burn through it?
B	mm
A	or am I gonna be able to chip away at the capital
B	yeah
A	and just use it right at the right time?
B	that's right
A	so until you've got that answer
B	working those things out yes yes of course yeah yeah yeah yeah exactly yeah and erm
A	see the way I'd do it is like if I didn't have this job and I was trying to set up like you I'd go right how do I earn money real fast? okay I would erm go and do summer schools cos they pay you gross er you don't have to be there forever you just do an intensive month and because it's just on
B	mm
A	okay? that will be my seed money
B	mm mm
A	and then I go off and do what I wanna do
B	yeah mm
A	I'd go that's all I'm willing to commit to doing that's those summer schools it's not about me knowing that I need twenty thousand pounds I'm just guessing that if I have twenty thousand pounds that that's gonna take me some way yeah?
B	mm
A	erm and er and and that's all I'm prepared to give of my time anyway to to earning money on on er in that particular job
B	yes
A	because it I don't like it so I'm only going to do enough of it to get me to where I need to be
B	mm
A	financially
B	mm
A	to seed my capital
B	yes
A	that's how I'd do it
B	yeah mm mm
A	and I think most people do
B	erm
A	and I just think most people who haven't got access to investment
B	yeah yeah yeah exactly
A	bank managers
B	mm
A	and stuff like that most of them will go
B	mm
A	because it's actually the thing that actually got me a lot of fucking money
B	means to an end means to an end
A	yeah
B	yeah mm
A	cos when you leave normally you leave at the time when you're actually earning quite a good peak of money cos what I've seen what people were doing was that they were leaving not because er the money was good
B	mm
B	yeah that's right
A	look at what
B	mm
A	and when you break that down into a contract of you know whatever that is doing something or other that
B	you've made your point erm
A	I don't know I mean I think you need to sleep on all of that stuff yeah I think we've kind of gone through that bit quite a bit let's just sleep it let's sleep on that stuff and come back to it fresh tomorrow
B	righty-ho
A	don't think I can make any decisions now on those things but what I think we do need to do today erm
B	the time frame for what?
A	for for erm what's going on and er what's going on what's er what I've I've marked out some some pointers I'll actually get my little book so I can show you what I've been thinking of
A	do we need a gin and tonic?
B	erm if you've got some tonic
B	no okay
A	huh?
B	erm well you're not gonna make er something else?
A	well
B	have a look at what's there
B	monthly basis
A	well it's the visa thing so I worked backwards from
B	mm
A	twenty-first of July
B	that's this year
A	er sorry next year
B	yeah
A	so
B	mm
A	two thousand and fourteen
B	yes
A	not very long
B	the big picture
A	where is it? fits in with
B	what?
A	that
B	yes
A	I would like to do a doctor's degree in that
B	if the if if if there is something research out of it that comes together
A	mm
B	right so if you did that you could frame that information in the context of business at the same time couldn't you?
A	get seed money
B	yes
A	cos it's research
B	yes mm
A	UK very forward-thinking
B	right
A	uhu
B	okay so you're interested in that in context of the thing in
A	with the Singapore thing
B	yes
A	yeah
B	okay right
A	so it gives us travel to Singapore and Asia and Australia
B	yeah
B	yeah okay erm
A	that would start in October two thousand and fourteen
B	right okay so that's er what? a semester-based thing? start of a year?
A	erm yeah it's just said it just says it starts in October
B	right
B	okay so
A	well I have to go about I I I'll have to go about erm being the researcher cos I'd have to put a thesis
B	mm
A	so you can you er er it's one of these weird ones that's some sort of hybrid where you're still getting a doctorate degree but you are actually a professional working like a work
B	for an outfit
A	yeah
B	mm
B	yeah okay so you get a doctorate out of having done work with certain people and doing the research and presumably the company you work for get the benefit of your research?
A	no the research'll be mine
B	no? right
A	erm dunno how that all works out that's why I have to
B	oh so that you have time off like it's erm you know day off for uni kind of thing
A	yeah
B	mm
A	how do you do that? how? you know
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	of course
A	someone passes on that information and
B	yeah
A	you basically try and put what you can together but essentially I would want to be earning money
B	mm yes yeah while you're trying to do that
A	cos it's er professional development
B	yeah
A	so I need to be in a profession but I
B	if you want to work in a university
A	no no no even if you wanna prove that you fucking know what you're talking about with this shit cos you get credibility
B	yes that's right
A	you know you go into industry and you're like I'm I'm a professional
B	mm
A	with a doctorate degree like oh
B	so I'm curious about the perception by some people that if you've got a doctorate degree the options that you have when you've got that are limited because you are so specialised
A	no no because there's different types of doctorate degrees
B	I know it's a very generic
A	no it's alright
A	PHD
B	yes
A	mine's not a PHD it would be an EDD doctorate of education education is a profession
B	right
A	so if I work within the industry of education
B	oh er er okay oh I haven't seen that before
A	mm PHD's academia
B	right yes so it was the academic side
B	of it I was thinking well you'd just end up down a a deeper tunnel
A	no fuck that I'm not doing that
B	no
A	yeah
B	and that's I'm glad you said that
A	yeah
B	alright so
A	I'm not interested in doing a PHD
B	right okay so that that that's fine erm
B	mm
A	you've gotta do travel and you've gotta get funding and
B	yeah
A	you know you've got to pitch and pitch and pitch away at it for probably about three to four years
B	mm
A	I think you can I think if you look at more like a community capability development or er er you know like a
B	mm
A	it's this idea at the
B	sharing knowledge and teaching people
A	yeah it's a big trend I guess in the world going on about that
B	and
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	so I think if you can prove that
A	I think if you can prove you can do that yeah
B	so er imagine if er for instance this thing we talked about in Vietnam that that you get a connection with some outfit
A	British Council
B	that is doing that yeah
A	yeah yeah yeah yeah
B	and erm
B	and that you're doing the work
A	yeah
B	you're getting paid to do the work and a part of your your your personal remit is to carry out research related to what you're doing
A	yep
B	so the output is yours
A	mm it has to be it's your original work
B	yeah but that has to be independent of your work because typically your employer will carry copyright for anything that you do
A	no not not no it doesn't work like that mm mm
A	right
B	what I have been doing it is like that
A	yeah
B	any work you do is the copyright of the business
A	yeah no I can work I can do work for my employer
B	yes
A	I'm just not doing the research for my employer
B	right yes exactly okay
A	I'm doing research on my doctorate degree
B	but what if er and then what if there's crossover though?
A	well you come to some sort of arrangement most of the time
A	people understand you're doing a doctorate degree understand that you've got to produce original work it's got to be of your name
B	right okay so if we look at that
A	mm
B	in in context erm
B	business-wise er and certainly the research side of it?
A	well yeah I mean you know
B	no
A	you've gotta you've gotta
B	mm
A	you've gotta go to the UK you've gotta go to the
B	you've gotta start somewhere
A	go and talk to them and find out exactly what the degree entails then you have to find a supervisor that won't happen in August you've gotta have a thesis proposal
B	to present to somebody for them to consider to er mm
A	to present for them to even think about whether they want it
B	mm yeah
A	the lead time is probably is about a year if you're really looking for a quality supervisor
B	yeah okay
A	yeah
B	and if you give yourself that amount of time then you'll get that
A	yeah
B	and that's fine
A	well if we're taking this we're moving round the world kind of thing
B	yeah it doesn't have to this is the whole point
A	yeah it
B	mm yeah
A	it's just like what you just go where who what
B	mm
A	whatever suits you
B	yeah
A	you know? pick out fly to wherever it doesn't matter
B	exactly mm yeah erm
A	you do need a base to put your shit
B	yes physically
B	well and then you really wanna cut down on the cost of that
A	cos both of us can fly in and out of well I know but I mean look people are doing it and
B	yeah yeah and most of their stuff just probably ends up at their parents' house
A	yeah
B	mm
A	but I mean if we're following that dream
B	yeah yeah yeah of course
A	we have to fucking start thinking about it right doing it right now
B	yeah yeah
A	yeah
B	mm mm
A	cos otherwise it's never gonna happen you're never gonna internalise that process if
B	no you have to operate like that
A	yeah so that's why I'm I've already accepted it as an assumption
B	and you have to accept that that's er it's a potential cost
A	yes of course it is
B	mm yeah
A	mm that's why you have to find a way to fund it
B	mm yeah erm and there are mechanisms that you can use that are quite
A	well yeah I mean clearly like when you get to England
B	that's just all detail anyway let's not worry about that
A	yeah that's what I mean you know the er the
B	yeah yeah yeah that's all just er who cares?
A	yeah you keep doing detail stuff
B	erm yeah I don't no er erm erm don't step back so
A	mm
B	yeah
A	cool
B	erm and and that kind of stuff is good in a way because erm it is good because erm it provides you a timeline through which certain things have to happen
A	mm
B	and you try to synthesise things together
A	mm
B	such that you get the maximum benefit at each stage out of it
A	mm
A	mm
B	erm so you you really think hard and strategically about how do we make this work for ourselves
A	mm
B	in the best possible fashion
A	mm
B	and if you look at look it doesn't matter where you are in the world but if you look at relative cost et cetera it is obviously cheaper to live in Asia or something like that
A	mm
B	so if you er started such a thing in Singapore as an example erm
A	yeah I don't know the details of how it works out
B	who who know who know who knows but it's
A	but but yeah we certainly would be leaving Sydney and we're going to the UK so I can start in the UK in October
B	that kind of
A	yeah because until somebody tells me it's any different that's the assumption that I'm making
B	mm that's fine
A	okay but yeah Singapore does feature
B	mm yes but what that means is
A	just don't exactly know when where and how
B	er yeah
A	yeah just don't know
B	as er as another thing
A	yeah
B	so you would be hoping in August to draw something out of your time there in relation to this
A	yeah I'd wanna satisfy that I'm picking the right course and I've got the right kind of idea about it and how much it's really gonna cost me and how can I really get funding you know I'm gonna be asking some really
B	some of those detailed
A	really detailed questions in
B	so is it er is it possible to ask that without you know have a lot done in advance
A	no I'm I make an appointment er and I'll I'll you know okay there might be a way so there's a lot I might have to do my email anyway
B	you can do it online wherever
A	yeah but no when I'm in
B	oh yeah for sure
A	I'm not signing up for something that I don't fucking
B	mm that's not real mm
A	talk to students
B	mm
A	talk to other people I'm just so you know once bitten twice shy with some of these things
B	yes yeah you need to know that for real you've gotta yeah
A	you've gotta have a on-the-ground feeling about it
B	yeah yep
A	you really do
B	exactly and you want to understand that with your background that it's feasible that you're going to be accepted to this stuff et cetera et cetera
A	yeah and I might even go to another university just to sort of compare and contrast
B	find the other side of the fence
A	mm
B	yes and that's not a bad idea either
A	mm
B	erm er
B	mm mm well of course
A	I'm like yeah I suppose yeah
B	my uncle
A	yeah
A	he said you know why why not?
B	mm
A	why why would you not place yourself you know somewhere
A	all they're gonna tell you is
B	mm
A	you know
B	mm
A	and I was like and he said you know you've got a first-class degree so you're already in there from their perspective
B	mm
A	your first degree if you can get the equivalent of a first-class degree on your masters of education then
B	on your masters yeah why not?
A	why can't you?
B	yeah uhu
A	so I went alright
B	mm
A	I'll see how it goes
B	mm oh well it's worthwhile just having a chat with people there
A	mm
B	because it's an easy thing to do
A	mm dead easy and I made I didn't
B	yeah why didn't you just go and
A	I er could've just bowled up to
B	oh er of course yeah yeah
A	I could've just done the whole fucking week with them
B	exactly
A	rather than wasting all this time
B	and you would've saved the effort and the time and the money and all of that flapping around
A	so yeah
B	yes yeah have a look at what's on your in your own backyard first
A	yeah
B	yes
A	especially if it's
B	yes well
A	yeah
B	erm but that that's cool
A	so the penny's dropped then?
B	well there's no dropping pennies
A	but
B	I'm thinking with an open mind
A	yeah
B	which is that you know the context is you know you could do that and one could live in France
A	yeah I love that idea
B	you know?
A	go and live in dad's place
B	but
A	yeah er
B	you know what I mean?
B	you're er your own architect
A	but look she's in Brisbane
B	yes
A	and she's you know been remote for some time and she's still she's
B	and she's travelling to Spain to do it
A	as long as you can get to your supervisor when you need to
B	yeah
A	and by the way sometimes supervisors can fly into where you are
B	yes
A	if it's an attractive place to be like Paris for example
B	absolutely of course
A	and er the other thing is is that erm
B	mm
A	like the other thing
B	that's fine that's fine
A	that's what you're paying fees for
B	yes of course
A	to get some sort of educational training thing
B	but you get the context that you
A	yeah and you should have a relationship with some of the people in your university because
A	mm
B	which is you can be anywhere to do whatever you want for whatever reason
A	mm
B	whether it's need or a want all of that kind of stuff
A	mm
B	yeah? and that you can er act and react on your toes as you need to
A	mm
B	yeah? so that would be the best context that you can go overnight erm we're gonna go and do this next week and then you put plans in place and you go and do that
A	mm
A	and if we've got a wee nipper in tow well so be it
B	yes exactly now
B	yeah and er
A	well
B	well you just put other
A	the the truth of the matter is is that er
B	yes
A	erm and you probably aren't right for the you know until really a year
B	for the bigger journey yeah
A	but that's why you need somebody you can rely on to take some of the pressure off the two of
B	exactly and when that's somebody that
A	and dad's perfect for that
B	yes exactly and er and whether it's somebody that's as close as family or somebody else that you build into your life to allow that
A	well think about all that
B	yes of
A	yeah
B	you know you just share the wealth
A	yeah
B	and and you can make it possible feasible
A	yeah
B	so that's just open-minded thinking as far as
A	yeah and I I I'd be quite happy to have the baby born in Britain
B	mm
A	cos fair dos then it's really obvious what happens is they get a British passport
B	yes which in theory has its er
A	which is a European passport
B	yes of course
A	which is already access to how many countries?
B	yes er of course yes
A	it's a win-win for that child
B	mm mm and through connection erm simply they themselves
A	New Zealand yeah for sure look at what happened with
B	yeah mm and that's how it exists at the moment but
A	well you just apply straight away for one apparently that's what you can do
B	yes that's right on behalf of your child
A	cos
B	yeah mm
A	he got a
B	yeah no that's that's the way that you do it that's the way you do it mm
A	he got a Kiwi passport in three weeks when they found out
B	of course
B	so one would imagine it er works either way but aside that again is detail but
A	it's pretty important detail though
A	yeah
B	yeah that's fine
A	and also I don't think British er immigration would have too much of a problem if I bowl up looking quite pregnant and they're going like oh right so are you here to have a baby? I'm like
B	no but you're a British resident it's got nothing to do with them
A	yeah exactly that's why I don't er think I'll have a problem with it
B	mm
A	it would be a bit different if I bowled up to New Zealand
B	yes you would have to be in the door beforehand
A	don't think they'd like that very much
B	no
A	no
B	you have to be in the door beforehand
A	and here was just a fucked idea there's no point having a baby here
B	no yeah that's right mm exactly erm
A	can I also mention something else to you? this is round about the time we can start
B	yes
A	even if it got to December until I actually got pregnant
B	yes and then you've got nine after that carry on er overlaps that October no? it's right on the nail of it
A	two three four five six seven eight nine
B	oh no it'd be on the same day
A	I can take six and a half months maternity leave from
B	yeah that that's pre and post though isn't it?
A	yeah
B	yes so the you've got three pre and three post let's say
A	yeah
B	yes
B	or does that is that how it work? I dunno it could be shorter before and more after
A	it's it's look it's it's
B	mm
A	it's always you have to
B	right
A	but quite clearly
B	mm
B	tootle off tootle off
A	yeah just do what we wanna do together
B	mm
A	enjoy that time together working out what you know what's going on with you and stuff and business and proposals and
B	well that that in itself would be quite er quite advantageous wouldn't it?
A	and that's only that's only if er you know if it had got a bit earlier so
B	then bigger picture better off yes
A	mm
B	mm not to be said to anybody
A	mm
B	but that's quite cool
A	well it'd be funny wouldn't it?
B	well er it would be it would be no I I do and er I
A	mm
B	or something? but really what I'm trying to drive at is I want some key actions that we can both buy into having value
A	mm
B	or or otherwise it is simply related to
A	mm
B	yeah?
A	well I I would also say that you know the the the the
B	in June
A	er er in these in er you know the time when the time when you can be away without things being too problematic and anyway we're gonna be away together in England
B	mm
A	but after that you are gonna have to be around because otherwise I'm not gonna get pregnant
B	no that's absolutely right of course
A	yeah I need you there
B	yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	but
B	no don't worry about that
B	look this is related to my birthday that's related to your birthday
A	yeah
B	they are the reasons why that's there really yeah? and the fact that I'm trying to put this stuff together now is to make the most of what's been a bad situation
A	mm
B	the intention initially hadn't really crossed my mind more that it being erm
A	mm
B	you know erm and that's kind of the big picture
A	mm
B	erm when you start to refine it and say well I want to get something out of this who can I meet? who
A	mm
B	erm and
A	mm
B	which you can simply do some standard market research with you know
A	mm
A	mm
B	about whatever they do and learn about what they need what they want
A	mm
B	where they think they're going what their future looks like that kind of stuff and there is definitely value in any of those conversations
A	mm
B	with whoever and like you say you meet with somebody and if they show you something else I'm sure there's something you learn out of seeing that
A	mm
A	absolutely
B	erm so
A	so
B	if I say there's three two weeks
A	yeah
B	two weeks let's say four occasions
A	mm
B	that are of a let's try and get the most value out of those four occasions and the rest of it becomes other things that may or may not happen but can provide some other benefits as well
A	yeah I think I understand what you're saying
B	now there's no reason why I can't meet four different people
A	mm
B	in in four different countries
A	mm
B	really erm if if
A	write this down and I'll make another drink
B	okay
A	it's not bad actually is it?
B	yeah it's cos the ginger's a little flat
A	mm
B	okay
B	okay so I'm back on recording now I just paused it for a moment so what I've got in terms of people is in Malaysia
A	mm
B	it's just up the road from Singapore so easy to get to
A	mm
B	erm there's a guy from Location Rebel who has who I mentioned who lives in Singapore he's Singaporean
A	mm
B	so he's a native you've got
A	yeah
B	er but I don't rely on that specifically
A	mm
B	Location Rebel wise
A	okay
B	he's likely to be American
A	mm
B	but
A	mm
B	erm you've got and then you've got Indonesia you've got
A	mm
B	so trawl the brain for that
A	mm
B	erm and also in Indo there's potentially people that are
A	mm
B	he's a little older than us
A	mm
B	so mature
A	yeah
B	but erm very receptive and I
B	so erm er I've just forget his name off the top of my head but erm he's very approachable yeah erm
A	you got erm you got erm
B	yes we have erm
A	erm who else do we know in Sydney?
B	people who have Asian business connections
A	mm
B	that could be erm
A	mm
B	well rather than halting there we'll come back to that
A	mm
B	erm what I know is we talked about this Vietnam thing you know the guys who I listen to on the radio
A	yeah
B	they live in Ho Chi Minh city
A	oh yeah?
B	at the moment
A	well that's
B	right? so you've got erm er his name's
A	right
B	right? so that connection's very strong and they're very good friends
A	yeah that's good
B	right? so and that guy I think if he presents him well himself truly has an open mind to talk to anybody about anything
A	yeah okay
B	and he's got a philosophy background as well so he he he's a thinker
A	yeah
B	you know? he likes his business stuff but he is a thinker
A	yeah
B	which is quite good
A	yeah
B	and he's very much he's lived and worked in different parts of Asia so he's been in Bali he's been in the Philippines he's now in Ho Chi Minh he's probably travelled to everywhere
A	so how long would it take to travel from Singapore to Ho Chi Minh?
B	well I'd say it's probably an hour and bit on a plane
A	oh right
B	yeah not far
A	okay
B	because it's that's just
A	south isn't it?
B	it it's quite a way south
A	yeah
B	relatively and er
A	yeah
B	and and it's erm probably way over the east coast
B	well I did ask her
A	yeah
B	I did ask I said have you still got friends there
A	okay we'll put that down too
B	so that's er that's erm
A	yep
B	and and how they operate in those places and out of this
B	you know you can go to Chiang Mai it's the head of where all the backpackers hang out and do business
A	backpackers do business? fucking hell
B	well they're not they're not just back they're not just backpackers
B	you know they're people who are actually trying to run a business but they like to be based in Asia cos it's cheap
A	fair enough
A	yeah
B	but provides them a good benefit erm
A	well yeah erm
A	certainly
B	and
B	yes?
A	definitely ask
B	yeah
A	she'd be delighted
B	right okay
A	delighted to have got something
B	to earn more yeah
A	oh yeah
B	well to tell the story yeah so we could Skype
A	yeah?
B	yeah this is er a lot of this I'm thinking and and generically I was gonna say my message out to
A	didn't
B	Hong Kong?
A	think it was Taiwan
B	you could ask her
A	mm
B	cos I could have a chat to him get
A	actually no don't talk to him cos he
B	he's a bit wired
A	yeah he he'd probably put put he'd probably put you off
B	he can maybe yeah well he'd put you in the wrong direction too
A	yeah maybe and I think you've got enough people on your plate now so
B	negative yeah yeah yeah erm general er general questions so erm really my point is it's best to
A	yeah
B	er Western people so
A	yeah
B	that creates that kind of feeling of there's a business connection potential
A	yeah
A	yeah it's very
B	and that they're kind of the go-between
A	yeah
B	to start with
A	is
B	well he's talking about moving kind of soonish isn't he? so erm he mentioned
A	really keep in contact with him don't rely on me to
B	no I did I sent him a message the other day
A	oh good
B	and I said gimme erm gimme the details of your mate who's a graphic designer
A	mm
B	I wanna know that
A	mm
B	I wanna look at what he does
A	mm
B	no he
A	okay
B	yeah cos you know if I ask him again I'm sure you know
A	mm
B	but he's easy to get in contact with and he's reliable to get back to you
A	mm
B	I just put it on Twitter and he gets back to me straight away
B	yeah erm so those kind of connections are what we're looking for so is there anybody else that we
A	I'd say for now we'll probably do alright with just keeping that for now for Saturday evening when we're having a few drinks
B	yeah that's fine
A	yeah
B	and we might erm streamline that but I can bung out a bunch of messages quite easy
A	and some people will just go no but I know somebody who has
B	yes and that's fine and that's what I'm looking for
A	what about
B	oh yes of of of course
A	er connections
A	to be connected to be well-connected
B	right as networking
A	yeah
B	context of networking
A	to yeah yeah
B	it's not it's not gifts?
A	er
B	cos cos
B	right I remember when I was trying to get in contact with erm that university that Adelaide lot I'd gotten in contact on Linkedin with a lady who is a consultant who briefs people about how to do business operation in China and she had a video online which talks about that kind of stuff
A	yeah
B	yeah I know I just kind of it was in er it was just er kind of we were in a flow in the flow so it was just kind of like
B	oh yeah okay
A	mm
B	and I thought I'll just go back to that
A	mm
A	mm you should
B	certainly his point of view
A	always ask your questions that's what you're practising
B	yes that's right erm
A	okay so that's good now can I have a turn about what I want to talk about?
B	yeah that's fine
A	okay good erm so
B	is this for the record?
A	yeah
B	mm
A	cos it's bigger picture stuff
B	fine
A	erm
B	yes
A	so I think we've agreed we're not going back to
B	no that's right
A	we'll stay here
B	mm
A	and it will be you know our last Christmas here for some time
B	mm
A	so it's gonna be good
B	timing
A	er we're gonna I'm gonna try and store up as much annual leave between August's annual leave which was three weeks but I won't take off any annual leave between September October November try and store it all up for December if I can
A	erm and then erm
B	maybe you'll wanna
A	look if he wants to come out here just
B	just as long as he knows
A	needed a swap
B	get to know his sister better
A	we went to
B	mm mm I know
A	but that's alright because we could come out and visit him
B	yeah but you know what I mean
A	erm
B	yes that's right
A	but what it what it does mean is I would like to work on my father erm
B	beg your pardon?
A	to well work on my father I mean I wanna wanna find out when he's thinking of coming out to see us again in Australia and when suits us for him to come
B	right
A	which clearly wouldn't be er Christmas because we well unless
B	that's right
A	so which is slightly problematic because I'm not entirely sure when I'd get a good dose of annual leave unless it was about you know taking annual leave while I'm pregnant I mean annual leave meaning maternity leave when I'm at the later stage of things yeah? in terms of pregnancy erm and that would might be helpful
B	sorry I haven't understood that
A	oh okay so annual leave is only three weeks a year
B	is it nor four?
A	three or four it's not very long
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yes
A	if I'm trying to store it all up for December when
B	yes
A	and my father can't come out at that time
B	right
A	but my father should come and see us again
B	yes in between yes
A	so I need to find a time to accommodate him because I don't want to be going to work every single day ignoring him
B	that that that's right so if you're working from September October November December that's four months so that's a quarter of your annual leave entitlement
A	mm
B	for the year that you've earned
A	mm
B	so so that is about a week
A	mm
B	right? and through that Christmas period typically a week is about how much you need to to get you through that whole period
A	mm
B	yeah? erm and then
A	cos it's a bit cooler
B	when it's a wee bit cooler
A	mm
B	he would probably like that
A	mm
B	and it's a lot more calmer less windy rainy and all of that erm then er then
