A	so as I'm cutting your hair
B	oh yeah
A	do you want to tell me about erm the new phase of your business plan or or the troubleshooting of your business plan
B	well I've yeah I discovered that there's another erm element to things not just the standard area that I'm doing which is the bulls
A	no what I
B	well they're
A	but I thought you said the tape was no good because they pick it off
B	well I think they would they could well pick it off
A	so what's? what's this new?
B	well the new thing is these you had to put so to
B	and these cable ties are that's all the thickness they are they're about a millimetre two millimetres and by putting a series of cable ties around the top then it's going to be protected the strings are going to be protected the strings are going to be protected and
B	well well yes but
A	well
B	well I've looked on well I looked on the internet and I think you can get a hundred for sixty P so so if they're that cheap
A	oh right it's minimal
B	well it's it's very little it's less it's less than five P a racket
A	but what about?
A	yeah what about the labour?
B	well that's the next stage I've got to research because the I've been on the internet and where you can get the cable ties from you can also buy these machines eh they look a bit like a gun really like a staple gun but you
A	but but
B	but the this is not moving
A	I can't look because I'm cutting your hair
B	okay right
A	we should be having conversations about holidays if I'm the hairdresser not about
B	okay but it's yeah it's fine well this is much more interesting
A	is it?
B	but there's only these ones that
A	but what about changing the erm eh aerodynamics of the of the racket
B	well that's that's I just think that they're just so liked these things I don't think it'll make any difference at all
A	have you played with one?
B	no I haven't but I will do that's a very good point so what I'll do tomorrow when I'm going to badminton I'll put five on mind you there's a lot of difference between
A	it might improve your game
A	who's? who? the
B	the the players that I play with
A	what? they can't see?
B	well yeah they can actually a bit of a joke now
A	mm
B	but
A	sorry I missed that
B	you missed that but I think they could they could erm they'd have a job to see once it's like more than than the racket's more than about two or three metres away from you I don't think you can see them if you're
A	I'm just going to put the light on so I can see actually see what I'm doing
B	so I can I can do that for tomorrow it's a very good idea play with one and see see if it
A	yeah but for aerodynamics that can
A	could be quite serious
B	but for schools is doesn't really matter I don't think I don't I don't think that you know that I that isn't an issue in
A	why?
B	well these things protrude don't they? slightly if they're tight and are kept inside but I
A	yeah but they can't pick them off
B	they can't pick them off they are tamper proof exactly
B	there's no way you can get those out except with a pair of erm tin snips
A	so who who had this idea?
A	really?
B	mm
A	what did he immediately?
A	mm
B	he he he mentioned cable ties first and I I couldn't quite see what he was getting at and then he explained it and then he he then I went to his house didn't i? went to his garage and then he he got all these cable ties out and we had a look at them all and we took some into the kitchen and then we spent about half an hour three quarters of an hour experimenting he out these on and he also did this as I said this thing with a pipe but that's I think if anything's loose or slightly erm vulnerable the kids will find it out that's why the table cable ties are such a good idea cos they cos they cannot be taken off at all there's no way they can come off except with a tool so the two things that we did that we got quite excited about neither of them is student proof so we'd go back to the idea of just putting the ties on with nothing
A	so
B	five or six of them and and that will lift the racket far enough off the floors for them never to for the strings to never come in contact with the floor that's that's what it's all about
A	so are you doing a erm a sort of eh trial
B	yeah I think I will I think I will I think I'll say it to him that I've got a better idea or I've eh potentially
A	what what have you given him at the moment to try?
B	why? that's a good question I've given him three types of racket and they're all colour coded one is just with PVA glue which is which was your idea
A	sorry
B	so one has just got glue on and I've colour coded it on but it two
A	and when are you? when you going back to?
B	well I'll leave it a few months I think it's it's got to be over time hasn't it? but I can I can actually get it I think I've got plenty of rackets in the garage I can give him a couple of these or maybe more and say could you could you erm keep this in your fleet of rackets as it were
A	fleet? is that what it's called? a fleet of rackets?
B	well it's a fleet yeah they use the word fleet not just taxis you got like wind turbines a fleet of wind turbines yeah
A	yeah mm
B	yeah fleet is used quite a bit as a compound
A	fleet of cars
B	fleet of cars fleet of taxis fleet of lorries so fleet of rackets
B	well
A	is that you or?
B	well I'm I'm I'm christening our return here
B	well I think you can use it feature practice
A	have you heard it before?
B	no
A	well I think you're making it up as you go along
B	well I am yeah but I think that I think it's an excellent use of the word
B	so if I give him like three of these rackets three or four or I could just go back and say which rackets are gone I'll mend them and then I'll I'll put this this device on cos he's up for it he says it's a good plan and he's willing to help
A	is he not the stressed out teacher?
B	he probably is a stressed out teacher but he's at least got time to email me occasionally so he can't be that stressed out
B	pardon?
A	primary school is it?
B	no no it's a secondary school
A	oh
B	second of course it's
A	mm
B	but it's in
A	what? with her school?
B	er yeah well with
A	so that proved to you that primary schools don't
B	well I'm
A	I've cut your ear you know there's blood there
B	dreadful
A	I'll just get the tissue
B	how did you do that?
A	I don't know they must be very sharp the scissors
B	oh well I I said
A	I said I nearly cut your ear
B	I said be careful but you've got three lots of scissors here four lots of scissors and you've probably chosen the sharpest one
A	I
B	no I wouldn't do that so going back to this now you know quite a lot about the whole thing would you would you say this is a
A	I yeah I think it is
B	right well that's good
A	I just I think it's the best you've had so far
B	yeah
A	looks best
B	it's just you need quite a few of these ties I think you need probably seven
A	I don't
B	just so that is a bit labour intensive isn't it?
A	well you'll just have to up the price
B	yeah well what you do you'd explain it it's future-proof I think that's quite a good term future-proof you're
A	but if you get okay let's imagine you get all this sorted out
B	mm yeah
A	erm what about your marketing? is that?
B	no not getting very many at the moment I've got to have a I've got to have another campaign on marketing cos I a lot of a lot of flyers have gone out but not many people have erm
B	I know
A	I
B	well you know you've got to got to put these on
A	well can you put it on? you usually do that
B	it's this one I think
A	it'll have a stripe up the back cos it's taken all the hair off
B	well that's great
B	oh
A	not well you need
B	that's about right
A	mm
B	not that
A	okay
B	alright
A	I'll do another stripe
B	well don't cos you
A	I'm afraid
B	could you start at the other end? sorry
A	it's not it's not short enough
B	not short enough? okay give it back
A	it's not
B	well that's that's as far as it can go
A	can you take your glasses off?
B	yeah sure
A	right sorry I distracted you what erm you you were talking about the marketing
B	marketing yeah well I think maybe I've just got to concentrate on local schools and just pick the rackets up that's something doesn't seem
A	it doesn't seem to want to power through
B	why is that?
A	maybe it's too short for I just
B	well maybe that's it maybe
A	and there's a load of hair in there could you?
A	eh don't you're putting it all over the floor now
B	well give that a whirl
A	can you pick up that bits of hair
B	but I think
A	sorry yeah go on
B	well the thing is to to convince schools that they would be saving money and if they're
A	yeah but how are you?
A	oh it's not
B	oh right
A	that's why I haven't got the power right we're in business now
B	oh
A	sorry I keep interrupting you yeah go on marketing how are you going to get customers?
B	well I think the main the main marketing really is the practicality of the idea and the economy of the idea if I can convince them that would they would save like hundreds of pounds a year on rackets then I think it's a given that they would they would go for it but one idea might be to actually talk on the phone to not the PE department but the bursar or the person who picks up the phone who's in charge of money and say I can save your school a hundred two hundred pounds a year every year by a very simple measure would you like to hear about it? how would that be?
A	well I don't know anything
B	because if they if the string goes then they have to replace the racket which would cost them anywhere between five and ten pound
A	guinea pig
B	guinea pig research project and he was very willing to take part in it but things had moved on so we'd moved on from glue to tape
A	so are you charging him for this stuff? or are you?
B	well I I said you know in because you're going to help us with this project I'll do these rackets for nothing he was
A	well that's good
B	so I thought well that's that's means it's free from he thinks he's getting something for nothing and I think I'm getting something for nothing or very little so if he keeps an eye on the rackets I've colour coded them and marked them so I'll know exactly what's happened so he can see whether the ones that I've given him are you know have more protection and I'll slip in four or five more rackets into his fleet
B	fleet of rackets and and see what
A	well that's a huge business project
B	well it's a good project that that means a trip to
A	mm
B	have you?
A	well I don't think they'd be much good at making rackets
B	well they might be able to introduce me to the people who might be able to do it or at least do some research in their own language no?
A	mm well it would cost you so much money to pay
B	I know but but but it solves the problem that's and maybe they're aware of it and they just want to carry on with these rackets knowing that they're going to keep coming back with repeat orders because the strings are going to break maybe they know all about that maybe they're very canny or maybe no maybe it's just one of those things they never bothered to address
A	but it's been happening for years hasn't it?
B	I presume it will be
B	presumably it has they just need protection that's where the cable ties come in it's like such a good idea but I I think there might be something that you can put some kind of guard that you could put and lock on so it was tamper proof which would be one operation well one operation as opposed to six or seven operations
A	no but why? you you just need to mm
B	that's all I'm saying
A	you just deeper grooves don't you?
B	well that's yeah no ideally that's what they need deeper grooves exactly but there might be
A	yeah a guard but it affected it affected the play that's why
B	well yes but you're you're a very advanced player you see so
A	oh yeah yeah yeah oh yeah yeah yeah
B	well it's a very good question to ask but I will I will do that erm it's it's worth cos you've got to experiment haven't you? you've got to do your research
A	yeah
B	and know that like they will stay on they won't rattle about and eh they won't after their playing so I'll do that tomorrow I'll put the very light ones on I think not the these ones are smaller
A	yeah
B	so they they're even better maybe
A	erm so yeah can you just make this machine go so that I can do a
B	I need to put my glasses on for that
A	well they're erm a shave without any numbers
B	oh I see I see what you mean have you finished?
A	no I've just got to do the back of the neck
B	oh right okay well that's what I meant but you can still does it look alright?
A	it's too short and you've got a bleeding ear but otherwise it's very good
B	oh ah otherwise it's fine yeah well that's good I'll come back to this salon in future then
A	sorry about that but I don't know what happened really
B	that's alright mm
A	right erm it's okay I'll just do this last bit
B	yeah that was a good idea to try it out first but if I can get these rackets in the hands of these kids erm the next half the next half of the term I'll have a really good idea about how they work maybe I'll put different types you can actually get quite thick ones so if you had
A	sorry can you not move and look the other way it's like it's like look slightly to the right
B	oh right okay so it's possible to have thicker ones but that's quite a lot more expensive
A	can you look that way? thank you
B	so
A	head that way but down no that's it
B	you can have like double double the width but it's interesting obviously the the more plastic they put in the more they're going to charge you so
A	and the other way thank you
B	and the other thing is the more plastic you have at the top of the racket the erm the heavier it's going to be and erm
A	who?
A	oh the Dragon's Den man
B	yeah so when he was fifteen or sixteen he coached tennis for money and that's what put the entrepreneurial bug into him I think
A	mm
B	that's how he started making money he's a big tall bloke isn't he?
A	mm
B	so maybe he'd go for this idea
A	right that completes the hairdressing don't look in the mirror cos I don't think you'll be very pleased
B	oh thank you very much
A	a bit
B	really?
A	well you shouldn't have let it grow so long erm and then it would have been easier somehow to cut or I need to go to evening classes in haircutting
B	so what
A	it it was so long that it I had to cut with scissors
B	why don't you ask
A	well you'd have you'd have you'd have to go the salon and pay twenty-five quid
B	so or maybe I should go there do you think she'd do
A	well yeah and pay and pay twenty-five quid
B	is that how much they charge?
A	no you'd probably get about fifteen
B	but even so I can remember paying no when I was about I think two shillings was about the going rate
A	anyway
B	and that's what ten P in today's money
A	mm times have changed haven't they? and I need I need a big tip as well ten percent
A	yep
B	do you? and
A	yeah
B	well don't they build that into the price?
A	no it's an English tradition to being a hairdresser anyway that's enough for now
B	well they should do ah right have they got a fleet of scissors?
A	I don't know
B	there we are
A	right
B	so are you are you supportive of this idea? do you think it's going to work
A	yeah I think you should just try it out and see how it goes
B	well I will do
A	and with a new haircut you might
A	yep
B	so in some ways you know that that's good because the total package means I'm probably lighter even with the ties in the racket
A	yeah
B	but I haven't got as much hair
A	erm if you're approaching business men in discussions they'll probably prefer the shorter hair cut
B	mm
A	maybe let's let's take the positives
B	well I don't
A	mm best not to look in the mirror
B	mm okay
A	okay I'm going to turn off the machine now
