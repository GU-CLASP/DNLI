A	thanks for the tea mum
B	oh you're welcome you're the only one eating because I wasn't expecting your father back yet
A	no well you didn't you
C	I am back
B	okay well we'll have something in a minute
C	okay
B	so I've got to tell you erm I've just had a a text on the group chat
C	X?
B	he's just erm
A	there he is
B	heard the saga of the forklift trucks question mark
C	yes
B	and I just put a load of question marks thinking well what?
A	how does
B	exactly so I put a load of question marks down so
A	mm
B	erm cheapskate
C	stuck
A	how did they?
C	and it's a forklift truck
B	the combi as well I mean the combi's massive
B	so it's I said brilliant
B	the other one on it which immediately sank
B	poor
B	poor
B	got sunk into the ground I mean can you imagine? I mean how
C	there's that bit of er land next door isn't there that er
B	is is that what he's
B	is that what he's done?
C	something like that yeah
B	so but next erm
B	so before the car park area cos they've got the their yard
C	yeah
B	is there a bit still next to the yard before the car park?
C	well I think so yeah
B	they've made one for all the cars in it
C	he did yeah yeah
B	it's before that is it? or after?
C	no I don't exactly know
B	oh dear
C	but all I heard was he'd got he'd got three months free rent from er
B	well there's two forklifts stuck in it now
B	imagine a great big Hiab having to come and lift these things out
C	yeah
B	so he's gonna have to redo it properly now
A	is that cos they did it cheap?
B	yeah yeah he didn't put down enough erm well he cos
A	you want the best
B	tonne
A	yeah
B	a tonne erm could be a fitting could weigh up to a tonne
A	gotta be hardwearing
B	and
C	yeah
B	so that's a massive truck to lift the big fitting so if you've got that truck and a fitting on it of course you need a really substantial and it's gonna be expensive
A	oh my life
B	he's gonna be trying to argue now against the company that did the hardcore I'm sure but
A	yeah
C	yeah yeah
B	well that's made me laugh I tell you
C	cos if you
B	how funny is that?
C	if you look down the erm from the
B	yes
C	er you can see there's a couple of pipes actually where the cars usually go so I don't know whether they've
B	oh unless it's on the
C	feel like you can see but er anyway it's er obviously not haven't done a very good job
B	oh dear
A	oh yeah she went in today didn't she instead of coming to
B	yeah yeah
A	that sounds hilarious
C	have they erm?
B	that's about right yeah
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	so if you've got
B	yeah I mean we we don't tend to move anything quite that cos they're thirteen and a half metres long as well aren't they? I mean we do get some that big but we tend to get they might have a bit less than that job
C	oh
B	the odd five metre length or a and they do tend to bring that back there because sometimes they use it for demonstration purposes they cut it and weld it again to show people how to do it or if somebody wants the odd offcut and they can sell it so we don't but we don't tend
B	to get the the big big pipe but yeah it
B	they bought a truck but erm
B	yeah when you're when you're carrying those erm those pipes on it and they do do that
B	oh dear me
C	they got stuck in the
B	would have been hilarious to what?
A	the fire
B	well we saw a fire are you sure?
C	no we
B	it wasn't from the
C	oh well that'll be
B	near where?
B	but
C	yeah yeah
B	yeah it would have been yeah we saw loads of
A	more than a hundred
C	yeah yeah we
A	firefighters are now dealing with the blaze about eight hundred tonnes of metal and plastic is on fire at a recycling plant in
C	plumes
B	crikey
C	or plums? plumes
A	erm
C	here's a plum
A	hundred firefighters are tackling the blaze now
B	that's not good is it? is that tea nice?
A	yes thank you
B	mm I bet can't see it now
A	two o'clock
B	he didn't sleep hardly at all we went over there
C	yeah mm
A	no?
B	and then he didn't sleep again and er and then she said she was going back to the car to feed him so I had a look in Boots
A	the car?
B	sunglasses I can't find the sunglasses I took to Bansko I don't know if I left them there
A	in
B	yes yes
A	oh
B	but then we drove to the
A	oh
B	cos
A	have they? in the
B	it was rammed
C	oh
A	really?
B	the
A	whereabouts?
B	oh
A	it's
B	in the corner where they've got Nando's and the the food place there's a WH Smith up there
A	yeah
B	it's massive it's nice cos it's all new and er so it's all erm
B	no because erm she got a text off
C	worse than
B	was it does he says it comes out before tax
C	oh right
B	so that that's a a little bit of a help
B	but I don't
C	right so and then he's only taxed on what he gets
B	yeah
C	as opposed to
A	but
C	getting his salary
B	yeah
C	they take it out and tax it
B	yeah that's right yeah
A	can't he speak to his new employers?
B	well I think he's going he's doing that via the recruitment agency because he got that job via a recruitment consultant so I think he's approached them to see if they'll approach
C	oh
B	so I I
C	wound up
B	screaming like you wouldn't believe so she drove into erm those shops just up from the
C	yeah yeah yeah
B	opposite the the
B	yeah that's right
B	I had to keep him entertained and then he started crying
A	you were in the back with him?
B	he well yeah cos he was just
C	ah
B	working himself
B	into a state
C	you troublemaker
B	so
B	he wouldn't have it she was upstairs
A	why?
B	well I don't know
A	if she doesn't want to take him outside she she wants him to learn he has to go to sleep in the house
B	but he was really getting on her
A	yeah
B	wearing her down and she
A	yeah
B	was upset
A	of course yeah
B	so erm we did we all went out we went up to the Co-op erm and he'd just started to fall asleep as we got to the Co-op so I took
B	he
A	really?
B	but on the train coming back erm she had him er it on her knee he was just watching
B	he was looking on the train cos he thought that was good fun he wasn't gonna go to sleep
A	but he
B	I know he was looking around wasn't he? every he'd just had his food then as well so he was quite full he'd had pear and he'd had his milk so he was quite happy
C	so long as he sleeps in er more in the night though I suppose then like learn to to
B	yeah but for for a five months old I'd have thought you'd would need
B	a couple of hours in the day
C	yeah
B	even if you're sleeping ten hours at night
C	oh really? okay yeah
B	oh yeah yeah absolutely erm but anyway we'll

B	I don't think he did
A	it was a fake bomb they said when I heard it
B	yeah I don't think he he he could have got on

A	it's a free service
B	oh okay so mm
B	so at least she wasn't gonna charge her for something she couldn't clean

C	there's no meat
A	no if there's er there's only

A	probably the bread and butter pudding
B	oh yeah
C	oh the yeah
B	bread and butter pudding
C	pudding I knew there was three bits but I couldn't
A	is there a lot of sauce in there?
B	oh there's quite a bit of sauce that would that would be erm
C	yeah that's a third full
B	if he did a chicken breast and did pasta with it and put that on that would be lovely
C	mm
B	mm
B	or just do chicken breast and have it with the carrots and the sweet potato he didn't find the sweet potato too sweet?
A	no
B	cos I must admit it was for me with the with the maple syrup in it
C	with the discs on it yeah
A	he's talking about
B	the
B	no but come out at the
C	oh right
B	did I say the
C	no but the entrance I just thought you meant the main
B	of
C	oh
A	yeah
B	the distorted glass?
C	yes yes
B	and I said I quite liked it and she said that she and
B	oh it's horrible I said oh it's really
C	smart mm
B	but erm mm that was that
C	right good
B	somebody had let go of a helium balloon inside
C	no lost
B	mm they've got smart lifts in there though cos we had to take
C	yeah
B	we missed one train so we went down and up a couple of times
B	cos you've gotta get different lifts for different platforms but they're nice they must have refurbed all those huge things
C	yeah yeah
B	they're nice and clean and
C	oh good
A	no rats
B	no you're cos you always think going up in stuff like that it's gonna be tatty but they were nice ones
A	was it busy in
B	no we didn't walk anywhere in
A	oh
B	just did the platform to
A	oh
B	the concourse cos when I was at was they said concord? I says they said concourse
C	concord
B	she says what what's that lift just said? but that's all they did so then you've got the escalators I don't know we didn't look around for the lifts
A	no
B	so I don't know there there must be some somewhere but I don't know where they were
C	but but the platforms are still
B	tatty
B	oh yeah they need to sort those out
A	have you been to it recently dad?
B	even if they just
C	well
B	put the
B	some seating and of a and a coffee shop down there or something
C	yeah it's still dingy and
B	it is dingy
A	there's no room to put a coffee shop on the platforms mum they're so busy aren't they?
B	no you have bits where they open out because there used to be
C	it was just waiting rooms there
B	a waiting room in enclosed where it was warmer
A	oh
C	yeah
B	and you could get a coffee or something
A	okay I don't really see them these days I don't think there is waiting rooms
B	no they they they got
C	no there used to be
B	they got rid of them all
A	oh
B	erm and not obviously where the platform you've only got a small gap but where they open out and you've got between the two
A	yeah
B	and you've got one on each side underneath like the stairs and things like that you can walk one to the other
A	oh okay yeah
B	they used to have or at last some seats
A	mm
B	they could put seating down there and they could make some warm areas cos it is cold in the winter
A	oh yeah it's freezing
B	and they they used to have that you could go inside so you're right on the platform aren't you but you could I suppose they're just encouraging you to go down when your train comes now which we did or we missed it
B	so we went back up again
A	you did miss it?
B	mm but it just said there was a
B	so we
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	mm is
A	I think so yeah
B	what just for tea? or
A	a sleepover
B	oh he's having a sleepover?
B	that's nice is he driving there then?
A	yeah
B	he's alright?
C	no he's recovered
A	he's not gone to badminton
B	well I wouldn't have thought he would have gone back there yet no
C	no
A	no he said he's drove all day though
B	oh that's good he's gotta take those crutches back I bet he won't he'll just shove them in his garage somewhere and that'll be that
A	do you not think he could take them back in the morning?
B	I know he could
C	but will he?
B	will he? yeah which A and E did he go to?
A	dunno
B	well obviously he could take them back in the morning where to? where did he get them?
A	I thought
B	well that must have been the A and E he went to then
A	yeah
B	oh gonna take my lenses out in a minute my eyes are killing me
C	right yes
A	okay then you go and take your lenses out
B	and then I'll be back in a minute
C	yeah and then I've gotta get changed and then I'll have my dinner
A	and then I'll cook
C	and you do
B	well his
C	dinner
C	what a routine we have
A	yes
C	excellent
A	excellent
C	excellent yes
A	this is the new aeroplane isn't it?
C	the big one that's coming to
A	is it?
C	yeah they've extended the runway and er they can now take the big A380 which is a double decker six hundred people carrier
A	here?
C	yeah so that'll be good for er
A	coming to what airport?
C	if if
C	yeah yeah
A	when did they?
C	they've already had them in
A	oh
C	I think it was just inevitable that we would we would have it here
A	isn't that what we went on to erm came back on from Thailand? I'm sure it would have been you know
C	well no it's only just come
A	no no to Heathrow we went to
C	oh I see
A	I'm sure we flew on a massive plane like that
C	could have been yeah
A	the plane going out there I keep saying to
C	right good
A	you know erm
A	where else so you've got like the three seats by the window? you know how when you're by the window normally it's just the window here isn't it?
C	right yeah
A	on this plane you went a big circle
C	oh yeah?
A	so like could or put your arm and you could put your head in the the window almost
C	oh okay almost like a sort of
A	like a
C	pod
A	pod yeah yeah
A	yeah the the
C	sleep in the pod
A	it curved out so much
C	oh
A	cos like no this isn't bigger this isn't bigger I was like it a hundred per cent is bigger
C	right yeah they're massive planes now look at the size of that thing
A	yeah do they have to extend the runway cos it takes so much longer to stop does it?
C	yeah yeah
A	why does it take longer to stop?
C	cos it's bigger and
A	do they travel at a faster speed?
C	although yeah I think they can probably sort of the same speed but anything bigger will take longer to stop if it's bigger
A	right
C	wouldn't it?
A	okay yeah
C	so er amazing bigger and better look at the size of that
A	yeah it's massive how many people? six hundred?
C	yeah
A	is that the most a plane can hold?
C	any plane you mean?
A	yeah
C	well I don't know I presume it must be close to it yeah so should be erm the fanfare about this plane that it must be er
A	is this the
C	the biggest no no no
A	oh it's not
C	it's it's that's the that's national news that is that's the steelworks
A	oh
C	yes
A	there he is
C	anyway I er oh there's the hijack let's check my tea shall we? see whether it's erm whether it's done or not do you want a chip?
A	no what have you got in there?
C	erm fish fillet steak fish and erm
A	chips
C	chips I think I'll do some I mean there's peas with it or something or some beans
A	good idea
C	and peas
A	peas and beans
C	or I dunno
A	oh
A	yeah
C	oh the sun's gone down
A	yeah but it's twenty past seven and it's still light
C	still light that's better isn't it?
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	it'll make it lots nicer when I'm walking home now
C	if you're walking home now
A	yeah
C	as long as it's not raining
A	no
A	this morning though it wasn't as light as it normally is but that's because we've
C	turned the clocks
A	the other way
C	forward mm
A	so whereas it was quite well it was light in the mornings when I was getting up
C	yes well it'll won't take long to get back to
A	it was still light but I think the fact that it was actually spitting as well and it was very clouded this morning it didn't help
C	right yes
A	but it wasn't like nice and light as it used to be
C	has been yeah well that'll improve
A	beforehand
C	as the days go on it'll er you'll have a you'll be going out in the light and coming home in the light

A	so I'm just trying to have a look at rotas for
B	oh work
A	yeah
B	why?
A	cos one girl's doing two lates this week and then she's doing them a lot next week and the week after again
B	two lates?
A	yeah
B	do some of them prefer lates?
A	no nobody wants to do them
B	oh nobody wants to? yeah but before in
A	yes
B	preferred that because if they had little kids they got them to bed or
A	yeah
B	or they did the school run
A	no nobody likes doing them
B	yeah that's a shame
C	yeah
A	mm
B	do they have to
A	yeah yeah but I I'd I don't I find doing a rota is so tricky
B	why?
A	cos there's so many people
B	oh do you have to be fair then with the number of hours you give everybody?
A	yeah everyone's gotta do certain hours and some people can only do some days and
B	oh
A	you've gotta have enough people to open and enough people to close and you can't have too many people
C	yeah
A	doing too many closes in a week and then if they've done two closes the week before they can't do two closes that week
B	really? why?
A	just because otherwise you'll give more I'd probably give one girl all the closes like and not realise I'll give her three closes every week
B	oh
A	kind of thing and then
B	crikey it's like erm it's like a game you should be able to enter all the criteria and up comes a name
