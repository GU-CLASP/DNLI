B	what?
A	well she's too late to have children now isn't she
B	no
A	I'm talking about whether he want one of his own or not
B	oh no I don't think so cos he's got the same age now and
A	oh that's good
B	even though it's only one a month
A	that's yeah well that's enough to see anyone
B	yeah
B	okay
A	yeah well what did they used to say?
B	right oh
A	it's true isn't it
B	or don't you believe that? I don't know if that was the right one the right word
A	it's not the right one but I've I've put my my cape on my my
B	adapted it yeah
A	slant on it
B	yeah anyway she's seems very happy and that's oh it was really nice to have a chat because she erm I said oh hello she just said she caught me cos I'm just eating this
B	I said I'm just taking a break I'm supposed to be doing the er promoting
A	taking a break eating a cake
B	promoting the er
A	oh yeah she works there doesn't she
B	yeah so she's in her she got a top thing
A	oh right she works there
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	oh wow
B	so I actually I held her up for quite a long time and they don't have
A	well that wasn't
B	by herself
A	well she would be eating a cake
B	no I just happened to be next to her stall I don't know
A	oh I see right yeah
B	it wasn't wasn't the cakey bit if you see what I mean
A	oh right she'd already bought it
B	yeah
A	and took it to her table
B	yeah
A	ah
B	so I had a nice long chat with her
A	well she's a lovely lady
B	she is nice isn't she
A	yeah she is
B	yeah oh she and she told me about their dad as well
A	probably yeah yeah
B	anyway because er you know
A	well she would do because she's young now
B	well she would do yeah
A	yeah
B	but they they always they always get so excited when they find out he's coming over to see them and then then it all goes wrong and they're so disillusioned and it all goes wrong again
A	well that's because they expect too much probably
B	probably is
A	I mean
B	it's sad isn't it not usually no
A	with the children no
B	yeah
A	so the bloke has to come along and he has to treat them doesn't he
B	yes
A	cos he only sees them probably once a week or
B	mm
A	if he's lucky so he treats them and then he becomes the
B	mm
A	because the others
B	he does in general
A	he gets the points and you know they look forward to it
B	and mum has to say
A	and mum has to say come one clean up your room get on with your life
B	help help us with the washing up and all the rest of it
A	yeah and they go oh dad isn't like that
B	yeah
A	you know it's just it's just
B	but in
A	yeah
B	and they get so excited and then
A	well
B	he's not the wonderful person that
A	kids have got too much expectations anyway haven't they
B	yeah
A	I mean you have only got to
B	well it is like that with ordinary families isn't it
A	well it is
B	at Christmas you think oh it will be great to see so and so again and that and then they either turn up boring or
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	I mean I went to the class of fifty-nine
B	mm
A	did I ever know you? did I ever? I I can't remember you I
B	mm
A	you know
B	otherwise it's a huge gap isn't it
A	that's a massive gap you you think of
B	and you're talking about from about fifteen
A	yeah
B	from fifteen onwards well you change dramatically fifteen to thirty don't
A	god you have yeah
B	I mean fifteen to twenty even
A	but there there there is one regret I have about that about not meeting my headmaster Mr
B	mm
A	but of course I never got round to it
B	no you don't
A	it's like that's like telling your father you love him
B	yeah
A	which no bloke ever does
B	or or anyone
A	or yeah you know
B	you don't you don't do it otherwise they think what's wrong?
A	you don't think
B	I don't know why they
A	you can tell your mother you love her but your father is just a different thing isn't it
B	oh I don't know not really but like if if you haven't done it most of your life

A	mm well
B	mm too late really
A	no er that no it's
B	to send it
A	you don't have to say thank you we said thank you when we were up there
B	yeah I know
A	what more do you want?
B	it would've been nice nice to write something
A	you're too you're too soft
B	mm
A	I think I do it the right way you do it the the really er oh oh scary way
B	oh I'll just have to write to everyone at Christmas
A	why?
B	you can just send Christmas cards you do to people you don't see from year to year
A	you just send yeah yeah you send
B	I suppose it is a bit dated now
A	well whatever
B	yeah
A	right and she used to post them every year fifty cards which in today's money would have cost about twenty-five quid
B	yeah
A	wouldn't it
B	yeah
A	just for the post not for the cards the cards would now cost a pound so that's a pound for the cards which is fifty quid and twenty-five quid to post it is seventy-five quid
B	yeah a lot of money
A	you know but they used to send it they used to send cards to each other and never met never seen the people for donkey's yonks
B	mm
A	and yet she felt it her duty to send them cards
B	yeah
A	and I used to have to go out well I posted all your cards didn't I
B	oh yes yeah
A	oh no I didn't did I I left them in the front of the
B	no you didn't
A	so how many friends did you lose?
B	that was a waste
A	how many friends did you lose by not me posting the cards?
B	a few
A	well they weren't friends then were they?
B	you trust people to send to to do that sort of thing I never never trusted anyone since
A	yeah but I mean the you you
B	yeah
A	so?
B	well why didn't you post them?
A	I forgot but did you get twenty-five cards back from them people?
B	maybe I don't know
A	no you didn't
B	anyway
A	you didn't
A	so you I think you owe me quite a lot of money actually
B	well I like to keep sending cards but logically it doesn't it's not right
A	email is is is just email is an excuse
B	not at Christmas
A	that's a that's an excuse
B	that's being stingy as well isn't it really
A	that's horrible email I think and text
B	I think I think they need to write
A	anyone who
B	no you don't
A	something else with a but it's just a lazy idle thing
B	it is really
A	and well email is just a way of getting out of thinking about people
B	yeah
A	oh I mean what what did we get one year? I got a round robin
B	yes I don't like those
A	and what about that?
B	yeah
A	you know this is the round robin
B	this is what we've been doing all year
A	this is my
B	you do like to know what people are doing
A	yeah but it sends to everybody who whose oh that was awful
B	but it just seems so
A	and I thought if you're going to you know you write out what you've been doing for the and and what your family have been doing for the past year and then you've got all these all the people in your address book and you just go click and it's not personal any more is it
B	no
A	it's not personal at all you sent it to a hundred and thirty people who doesn't who don't really matter to you
B	yeah
A	but you think oh right I'll just send them all
B	like another person doesn't matter does it
A	no
B	yeah
A	so I think email and text is an excuse
B	yeah I think you've still got to send cards
A	that's a big excuse email and texts
B	it is
A	yeah
B	mm
A	you don't have to think about anything do you
B	not when it's multi people no
A	these multi texts or happy birthday or happy Christmas or whatever well done to a hundred and thirty people that you think you know but you don't
B	we better get back haven't you?
