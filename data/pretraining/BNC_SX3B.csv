B	oh it's
A	just put whole life
B	mm
A	whole life do you speak any other languages? sadly and shamefully no
A	education?
B	too much
B	too much education
A	not needed
B	underemployed
A	yeah so underemployed why don't we talk about underemployment in society?
B	yeah?
A	could be a good starting point
B	well we're talking about talking about something at the moment so that's fine
A	talking were talking about talking about something
B	yeah meta chat
B	how many years months have you lived there?
A	yeah I put whole life
A	shamefully yeah which er date
B	that one
A	fourth of September
B	he's probably somewhere about the
A	yeah let's hope he's not in the Pacific
A	just this side
B	is it just
A	just get your details in everything else is alright how good are these speakers these recorders?
B	don't know I've never used one before
B	looks looks pretty decent though
A	yeah looks quite nice
B	mm
A	as do these flapjacks thank you for those
B	yeah probably just try and forget that it's there
A	that's true or talk about the fact that it's there
B	yeah
A	as a
B	talk about how erm being recorded might change the way that you speak in yourself like
A	yeah
B	whether whether they should really be recording us in secret and but
A	mm
B	obviously they can't really do that cos we've gotta sign a consent form
A	yeah
B	unless you just follow round someone round with a tape recorder and then
A	could you do that would there be ethical implications to just going round recording conversations outside cafes
B	amend it yeah and then erm get get permission retrospectively
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	it's the same with the video interview that I had
B	you'll think yeah you'll think about I've I've just thought there what ah but they're gonna note down that I've just overlapped you in speech there and that might come across as quite a erm dominating thing
B	but really like we're so relaxed around each other
A	yeah
B	it doesn't really matter
A	there's no set pattern of speech here it's probably er I dunno
B	yeah I imagine the way that we're talking is gonna be quite different to how everyone else is gonna be talking so
A	mm quite possibly
B	although we haven't said cunt yet
B	yeah
A	there's the one
B	there it is
B	reclaiming it
B	reclaiming it as a term of endearment
B	yeah
A	separate the third the third person you're aware of yourself in the third person now I'm not I'm not just talking which is the facticity of what I'm doing
B	yeah
A	it's the
B	it's the idea of
A	mm
B	but then someone else listening to this isn't isn't gonna have all of the background of our like friendship and
A	sure
B	and like
B	on a daily basis
A	yeah
B	and just
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	in isolation
A	it's like the cork floating on the water
B	you've got well got my you've got my name you've my age you've got the you've got erm that I'm British that I speak British English
B	as though this kind of these are the most important characteristics that are gonna determine my of the way that I speak
A	yeah
B	when in reality there's a lot of different factors
A	yeah
B	they don't know that my they don't know that my
A	it's gonna be who you're with
B	parents are working class and
A	yeah
B	they don't
A	yeah no it's true you think there it'd be worth getting better insight or
B	yeah
A	surely? the the context entirely I suppose they'll be including that in their analysis somehow
B	well it's whether it's relevant as well
A	mm
B	it's not really relevant to
A	yeah
B	that we're talking about it's more
A	mm
B	mm
A	who knows
B	speech wouldn't be as natural
B	although this isn't natural either
A	no it's not is it?
B	I keep looking over at the tape recorder
A	yeah same
B	very aware that it's there
A	yeah this isn't like if we'd just gone out for a cigarette break
B	no
A	and had
B	no like well what's the difference in us going outside
A	now we know
A	yeah yeah
A	very artificial I'm afraid
B	yeah
A	erm that's alright then getting some some glimmers from us
B	yeah
A	getting some natural speech
B	what time do you think you'll finish work today?
A	erm
B	will you like finish half four or will that have to be like later?
A	oh yeah possibly it depends when
B	yeah
A	partly because this week's been so such so much of a nothing week for me
B	yeah
A	I can't really er
B	I'm taking the piss constantly
A	yeah fair enough
A	it happens well what time were you thinking of leaving?
B	well I got in at half eight so I can leave any time after half four really
A	yeah
A	oh that'd be nice yeah smoke the herb
B	and not go wrong
B	mm
A	just be careful
B	yeah
A	just just be careful
B	just be careful just be careful
A	I was talking to
B	yeah
A	and she said ah spent all my money travelling on magic mushrooms I was like
B	sorry?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	what do you think? they're great aren't they? and yeah we were just chatting about them for for quite while
B	what she travels around taking them? or no she spends
A	er she went she went travelling before
B	oh okay
A	and erm yeah they spent a load of money while she was travelling buying them
B	yeah probably had some quite profound experiences
A	yeah yeah can imagine if you're in the
B	yeah considering the experiences you have in a place where you like extremely comfortable
A	yeah and you know pretty well
B	yeah and then if you if you feel comfortable wherever you are if you're like a born traveller and you just like
A	yeah
B	you can just take it in the most amazing places and just not have no risk of like
A	I think it'd be incredible
B	worrying yourself
A	mm that'll be the next step
B	yeah
A	to get comfortable and at that kind of
B	do it on the top of a mountain
A	yeah well
B	that'd be a real spiritual experience
A	it would it might be dangerous it depends if you become really childlike cos
B	yeah but no because like when we've when we've done
A	we weren't taking risks were we?
B	when we've done to before there was no way we were taking any risks
A	no
B	I mean people like have all these like preconceptions that you're gonna like do stupid things but like
A	mm
B	like walking round no one's gonna like look at us and think that the the you know you're acting weird or anything like that
A	mm
B	so it's like still very aware of like cars like
A	it's true although spatial perception
B	of cars
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	I mean generally you are pretty safe yeah
B	well yeah and you're thinking about other things rather than the practical applications
A	yeah
B	of the car mm
A	yeah
B	yeah although
A	it's their car
B	when we were walking I remember like waiting at traffic lights for an inordinate amount of time waiting for like cos you're not in any rush you're not like
A	yeah it's true
B	you're like just it doesn't it's you
A	you're not going A to B are you? just
B	yeah you're not yeah you're not going A to B
A	no you are literally just unadulterated
B	yeah
A	falling through time and space
B	yeah
A	experiencing your true experiencing self the new born baby the
B	beautiful beautiful
A	yeah it's absolutely wonderful experience and I'd recommend to anyone listening to try and get your hands on something like that erm if you haven't already
B	yeah completely riskless
A	yeah
B	look into it
A	yeah look at
B	application for depression
A	yep yep all of these things in fact it's been used for thousands of years it's completely natural then then look at the hypocrisy and the drug laws and and the pharmaceutical
B	and if you think that it's wrong to take drugs just because it's illegal then perhaps have a look at the history of our legal system and er the ramifications of
A	mm
B	being a homosexual in the seventies
A	of course yeah
A	yeah
B	so what what are people gonna be thinking in the coming like years and or decades? how slow we were to react to something that's like pretty incredible medicine for
A	mm
B	for a hell of a lot of different ailments
A	mm exactly
B	physical and mental
A	mm
B	like twelve minutes
A	mm would you like any more nuggets of wisdom?
B	nuggets of wisdom?
A	nugget followed by something nugget after something
B	yeah
B	yeah chicken nugget
B	or a nugget of chicken I mean chicken nugget to me that sounds disgusting but a nugget of chicken I mean that sounds
A	quite
B	I mean as a vegetarian I mean I tell you what that sounds fucking lovely
B	mm
A	just a little nugget
B	really lovely
A	a golden nugget oh that's they got the branding right on that cereal
B	oh didn't they just?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	golden nuggets
B	chicken nuggets though no sounds crap
A	yeah yeah
B	nugget of chicken nugget of gold
B	they both sound better when you say nugget of something
A	nugget of
B	just cos nugget's a more interesting word so if you put it at the beginning of a phrase then
A	mm
B	then it puts the emphasis on it doesn't it?
A	you're like and it I want it
B	well good
A	when you hear just nugget it's just kind of like what does that mean?
B	chicken nugget you just think chicken you know nugget of chicken that's wow that's awesome
A	what does a nugget mean? nugget is just a chunk or a bit
B	I yeah it's just like a yeah just a discernible piece of
A	piece of something
B	yeah
A	anything
B	yeah
A	nugget of wisdom yeah can have that can't you cos you can have a nugget of a concept
B	it's like a raw form isn't it? which is quite weird considering the chicken nugget it's like it's probably like already formed it's like
A	yeah
B	nugget of already formed chicken
A	yeah yeah that's not right is it?
B	but nuggets of like a big slab of like
B	of like a chicken that's just been like
A	sprayed off the bones
B	sprayed off the bone
B	ears and arseholes
A	yeah yeah
B	beaks
A	course that's horrible
B	parson's tongue
A	yeah and then it's
B	what is it? no parson's beak
A	parsons
B	what was it?
A	erm parson's nose is it? is it parson's nose?
B	yeah parson's nose
A	vagina of the chicken
B	yeah
A	that's what we're talking about chicken cunts
B	yeah chicken cunts yeah
B	ah
A	but yeah that's true nuggets were you've seen a nugget of raw material and a nugget of
B	mm?
A	just a piece which is a lovely word
B	always a
A	huh?
B	all words are lovely really
A	yeah it's nice language is just
B	mm
A	that's why yeah it's great isn't it to just learn new words and to chat cos it expands your experience of the world
B	yeah
A	almost entirely that's what Sundays when I see that
B	he is gaining knowledge through the
A	yeah he is
B	he could gain knowledge in other ways
A	yeah
B	but like that is like very clear like
A	he's usually reading to
B	doesn't matter
A	doesn't matter
B	nothing that we're doing matters
A	doesn't doesn't mean anything unfortunately guess this is probably this thing we're taking part in now it's potentially one of the most interesting things
B	this is the most useful this is the most useful thing that I will do today
A	yeah
B	definitely
A	yeah
B	I'm a marketer by the way
B	don't don't do it
B	it's soul destroying
B	work for one of the best companies in like in
B	still can't not for profit
A	yeah
B	not for anything mate
A	yeah
B	pointless
A	just for life just for existence one
B	maybe yeah maybe this will help someone learn more authentic English
A	possibly yeah
B	yeah
A	the authentic English attitude as well
A	it's just sort of like misanthropy and
B	yeah
A	pessimism and cynicism
B	content on language integrated learning people who learn about psychedelics whilst they learn about language from us
B	they should definitely include this passage in full
A	yeah
A	for the next unlocked version of unlocked
A	we'll get the Discovery channel to do a
B	critical thinking
A	critical thinking
B	it's like ah critical thinking what what what a fallacy
B	what a fallacy free thinking
A	yeah it should be free thinking
B	mm
A	should get
B	to be fair if people want to collect natural speech
A	mm
B	why don't they just erm there's plenty of podcasts and things like that that's
A	mm
B	if if we're taking this particular exercise as an exercise in natural speech then what the fuck is the difference in just getting a podcast off the internet transcribing it and sticking it in the corpus?
A	sure
B	we do it with every other
A	mm
B	piece of mass media so why aren't we doing it with podcasts?
A	yeah
B	maybe we should suggest that to
A	yeah true shall we just pause this and go into go tell them?
B	yeah go and tell them to do that just go yeah
A	yeah yeah
B	American English there you go you've just
A	it might even be more natural cos we're not used to being on podcasts
B	exactly
A	there's people that do podcasts for a living and just kind of forget about it
B	all the time yeah cos even now I feel like I'm getting it just
A	getting into it a little bit yeah
B	forget about a little bit
A	yeah yeah it's true
B	speech becomes a little bit more natural
A	it takes time but in ten minute slots you've gotta think that maybe the first half of that people are still overcoming the barrier of being recorded
B	yeah
A	whereas here
B	so really is ten minutes long enough?
A	yeah
B	for the first few minutes we weren't really we maybe that's why they want us to do it for like a minimum of ten minutes so that you know your speech becomes more natural towards the end that's just
A	yeah that's true
B	take up a subsection with
A	mm mm will be interesting hopefully we can see what's done with this
B	mm
A	do do do what is the time now?
A	and do some
B	do some shit work
B	that's alright actually I've got some good stuff I think now
A	that's good
B	yeah feeling a lot more positive about it
A	good good good
B	yep
A	good news
A	thank you
B	probably just leave it running then
A	I'm so
