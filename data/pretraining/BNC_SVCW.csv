A	I was trying to be angry then
A	no
B	yeah so the pictures is my mission over the next few weeks to get to sort it out
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	like move into another
B	a set of three warm pictures like I said like not not the mountainous ones even though they're my
A	no
B	favourite
A	well it depends where we live doesn't it?
A	living in a hot country you probably want cooler
B	I don't know
A	yeah
B	I do think
A	no I
B	I like heat I like
A	yeah
B	to look at or
A	burnt orange and
B	well we like oranges and reds at the moment
B	maybe it's just a case
A	well I like the like Mediterranean kind of colours
B	mm
B	I mean like the the blue
B	I wanna say dinosaur
A	dinosaur?
B	I'm
B	oops
B	why that camel came out in blue I don't know but it's
B	it makes it a really weird photo
A	yeah
B	because it's cold colours
A	yeah
B	and a camel
A	yeah
B	which you associate with a desert
A	I don't know how I took that
B	but it looks
A	just the way the camera
B	I'm sure everybody would think oh it's just Photoshop they've made it blue
A	yeah
B	but it just came out like that didn't it?
A	yeah
B	it's almost a shame people can Photoshop it a different colour
A	yeah
B	photos like that and they just come out really
A	yeah
B	mm
A	huh
B	bit more striking
A	mm
B	whereas actually you could take any camel picture and make it blue
A	yeah
A	well that's
B	yes yeah I still like them
A	you know with a clear a silhouette with a clear background where you can change the colour of the scale whatever
B	what and then do a series?
A	then do a series
B	yeah
A	I think that would look nice but we haven't
B	yeah
A	I thought
B	woah
A	cos then we've got the
B	mm?
A	the silhouette
B	mm
A	got the camel one
A	the pagoda fit with it as well?
B	yeah
A	I dunno
B	oh I see
A	yeah
B	go with the orange one
A	yeah
B	and get rid of the camel one
A	yeah
B	get rid of the camel one
A	yeah
B	doesn't go with a man made
A	it was a corner of the Taj Mahal
B	what? yeah
A	yeah
B	with some sort of silhouette of a Chinese pagoda that would be nice
B	in a different colour
A	yeah
B	and then erm
A	I mean you you could Photoshop anything by
B	yeah it's the quality of the pixels that worries me with zooming in and stuff
A	oh
B	cos that's why they wouldn't do my
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	they said it'd be too pixellated
A	huh
B	but then they said
A	yeah
B	when they zoomed in and showed me
A	yeah
B	I don't wanna pay all that money for it
A	yeah
