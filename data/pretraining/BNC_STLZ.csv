A	erm okay yeah so
B	no they're not
A	they're educating in
B	the most of the time they're trying to earn money part-time work
A	right okay so erm
B	yeah no I agree and that's a
A	and and that but from their point of view
B	well I
A	had a little project to run
B	yeah yeah
A	all of that kind of stuff
B	yeah
A	so you're trying to map things that they you know
B	if they can explain it to us then that means that if
A	yes
B	so the idea is erm I would say is to go and put your eye in some cold water and you will get rid of what's bothering your eyeball cos the way you flush out your eye is just by getting some cold water and just flushing out the thing in your eye
A	okay alright erm
B	well I actually had a brainwave today while you're kind of
A	oh okay well I know what you yeah
B	trying to articulate what you're saying
A	yeah
B	erm look I'm only bringing this to your awareness a because you are
A	yeah
B	so now you have the terminology to talk about it and write about it other people will be interested in what you're doing
A	okay
B	it won't be a it won't be an it won't be a term that most people are aware of what that means
A	yes
B	erm and it also means that the students themselves when you when you ask questions like Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday if we still run with that idea that there is a personal learning network that's being exposed and the idea is to move away from networking or social networking yes we know that what it is but we need to show learners of any age that actually what they're doing in this new way of using people in real life but also connecting over the internet is a way of just shaping your personal learning network and the reason why it's called a personal learning network is because there is some theory that backs it up yeah and that the reason why we use that as a framing question is because we need something that's different from all the other websites out there
A	yes exactly we need to we either need to be working in a niche that exists or create a new one
B	it I think create a new one and and especially bring in other ideas from where people are on the fringes they're
A	mm
B	and those children turn into young adults and those young adults turn into adults so all we're doing is jumping in on a on a on a sequence of somebody's life and it doesn't really matter what age they are but I mean a and originally you started going younger adults erm mainly because I think they were drawing a bigger crowd but
A	okay so what I think I would
B	yeah
A	okay as a as a learning thing erm and that you would take people who who are near they've just they've left university fairly close by yeah erm and er in my experience typically what happens is people walk out of university and they don't go back
B	yeah
A	they don't pass on any knowledge there's no there's a total disconnect okay?
B	that
A	they just get on with I'm gonna go and live my life
B	most people yeah
A	yeah
B	most people
A	so
B	yeah
A	so but however those people have their own personal learning network and typically it's it's a continuation of what they've been doing at university because a lot of people will enter into some kind of professional growth thing with work okay? they've got something to learn to bridge a gap to actually operate effectively in a business
B	yeah
A	okay erm so that kind of tranche of people makes sense to me that you can connect these two together quite effectively
B	yeah
A	just a thought but
B	yeah no that's right
A	I initially when you were talking about this idea of just working in the university students I was a bit kind of well it becomes quite constrained
B	mm
A	and although it is a niche and it's a well-defined niche erm I I think we would have to think
B	well I I thought about this today and I think erm we can certainly start off erm with university students as the primary audience but the thing about it is that if we were using this idea of making a moving image as a case study and the people who were in the case study are actually using their own likeness you know they are a part of the case study they agree they wanna co-create they want to earn some money from co-creating a product erm and then the idea is that once you've got these niche products I think I've understood what this is all about in terms of scalability
A	well well it can be
B	yeah
A	whether it's that you have your your your your core erm er let's call it your your marketing blog presentation all of that that is your that is your your outward look for your business and beside that you can have er a membership community which is people who want something extra go to that community okay?
B	you're right look you could work it out on so many different levels I'm just telling you where the scalability comes from
A	okay carry on
B	if you're talking about big dollars
A	mm
B	and people are stupid enough to spend shitloads of money on crap stuff which they are at the moment I've talked to another
A	camera yeah yeah I know that
B	and getting them to talk at the camera that's that's old style MOOC
A	yes
B	that's not where we're going we're going further much further than that
A	mm
B	so even if the universities won't touch it with a bargepole because it's too ooh it's left of centre MOOCs will and if MOOCs start to change into something other we'll be there with product and content to keep filling it
A	carry on
B	and not all of them will sell some of them won't some of them will be really good and they'll sell well so you'll have your cash cows and you'll have your sort of slightly random ones
A	well that's what you're testing and that's what you're trying out as you go
B	mm
A	so erm you can go out and
B	maybe
A	because you can see it's quite easy to er find a storyline within all of that
B	yeah I suppose you're right but that would take some time to generate won't it?
A	well you need to do that anyway because this is a a keen mechanism on how to get traffic into your site okay? so you need to put yourself out there as the the relative expert
B	alright
A	okay
B	okay alright okay so I'll
A	so you can start on any thread but the
B	okay so I wrote something the other day
A	mm
B	erm that I can show you and the students tomorrow
A	mm
B	erm which it says dear university teacher and then what what we'd like from our learning is this and then it it puts through some ideas about what kind of learning should be happening at university so I was thinking of showing to the students tomorrow and seeing if they agree and wanna add something to it so it's starting a thread by a letter a letter that goes to dear university teacher and it's signed from university student so it's no names attached
A	mm
B	it's just a get the ball rolling
A	mm yeah mm
B	and I was thinking in that they might be something that you know students might get drawn to where they go yeah yeah that is what we want or no no no we want more of this so you are beginning to find out what they think they want from their learning
A	and in terms of the way you you'd be writing it erm is is the context of of
B	yeah
A	what the
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	and hence and hence have your your own personal learning network
B	personal learning network yeah
A	mm yeah
B	so if those two things are the way that the students and I you know are framing we don't confuse the waters er confuse people too much with too many terms we're just basically going what are you watching? you're watching people creatively solve problems this is a dialogue of Monday to Tuesday to Wednesday and what are they doing every single time we interview them is they're adding part of the solution
A	mm yes yeah yeah
B	and that's where you get the case study material from
A	and I've just thought of another thing about erm a connection and that is with employers
B	yeah yeah
A	and then what you can you're effectively doing is you're you're joining
B	yeah
A	and that you need that's what what you're trying to provide the student is the mechanism to shine above what this problem is
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	mm
A	so they're in a
B	mm
A	transition period
B	yeah yeah
A	where they've actually got this this common fuss and and and chaos and erm probably they've got expectations that they're not having met
B	true
A	and and one might be able to join this all together and say well actually don't look at the students it's not the students it's the people that are teaching them
B	mm
A	the there's a adaptation in it
B	yeah
A	mm
B	and that's actually living and breathing what we're saying we do
A	yes
B	yeah
A	and so you've got this kind of continual thing of of of of er you you start somewhere down here and you learn to a certain level and then that experience is lost from our point of view as well
B	yeah
A	yeah that that we need to understand whether there is a benefit that is then provided to business as an example
B	mm
A	in a more proactive and positive way
B	mm
A	and you can certainly get employers interested in what you're doing
B	mm
A	and you can say well this is
B	yeah
A	and the the the thing I do like about it the antithesis of what I'm talking about is that
B	mm
A	yes
B	in a way by the time that you've kind of you know gone through this
A	mm
B	people will come to your website and go can you do that for me I love it
A	mm
B	I love that
A	mm
B	I want you to come into my company and do that with my people
A	mm
B	cos I wanna show my own employees a case study
A	yes
B	from our real company
A	yeah
B	please come and do that
A	yes
B	erm so there's money to be made
A	mm
B	in various different places it's just that we're gonna have to work really hard on the format and work really hard on protecting it
A	mm
B	cos it's so easy for somebody to come along and get a get a whiff of what is actually being done
A	and just be
B	and just go off and create it themselves
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	you know
B	it's
A	mm
B	it's it's gotta be
A	well you
B	yeah
A	now
B	right well I mean what I need to talk to
A	mm
B	tomorrow but
A	er in context of video?
B	of
A	they they want to see the
B	most most people will wanna see the summary
A	yeah well so what what you
B	yeah
A	to to the end
B	yeah
A	and then you've got the others who know I I I can't do that bit but I do like the summary that I can see on a Friday night or a Saturday morning or a Sunday or a Monday morning or whatever it is
B	yeah
A	erm and so you're actually feeding two different crowds
B	and I was thinking if you wanna buy and get people to buy in
A	and a day
B	to the answer so you can go here's about a minute of the problem
A	mm
B	you only give them the problem but it's enticing enough to wanna know what the answer is erm so you say your learning opportunity is to solve this problem so you work on it and you think about and then when you're ready to come and have a look at it to see if your solution meets with the actual real life people's solution
A	yeah
B	you know it's like yeah right okay now what you could do next is so people are just in the community they are just actually using the case study as a way to very quickly share ideas about how to solve problems because they've got something to focus on
A	and I like the idea of you you well you you can quite quickly build many communities within your community
B	yeah
A	erm and some examples I'm seeing er with Location Rebel er that it's a big community there are
B	oh right
A	so they might jump back in and dabble in it
B	yeah
A	but there's this continuous
B	yeah
A	but what you do see er with some of the people who are experienced is that they find a mechanism which is
B	yeah
A	or they become part of something else which meets their new level because they've already learned the base they go to the next level they go to the next level
B	yeah
A	the learning er and some of them are doing that on a small group basis so like the hundred club
B	you did yeah
A	but I read about it
B	yeah
A	erm they are they are they are eight people they are eight people and each of those eight people over the last year have been helping each other
B	yeah fair enough
A	so so a similar idea that they are solving problems as a group together on a small basis of a really cosy community
B	yeah
A	and producing group products as well that they're involved in as well
B	you see what I like about trying to use the primary market as the the voice which is the student who's coming in from like university or or just graduated coming in as Monday and starting the whole ball rolling it's almost like here I'm gonna tell you my story and I'm gonna get some other people to be storytellers with me and that's the reason why they will select you know a person to interview and I will interview that person
A	and quite often there's just no transparency of that connection at all
B	no and the transition from being out on your ear after you know graduating to getting your first job is a fucking painful one
A	yes yeah
B	and it's not like your university is going to help you get a job is it? no they don't really help you get a job
A	that's not really what they're there for
B	at all no they're not
A	no and they can't get everybody a job
B	exactly
A	because you're talking about a large scale of people
B	yeah so I think that's a very good point that we can say as well in our in our website is no not every university is going to be able to help every individual get a job so that's why you'd come and look at these things that we're showing you
A	well we're not offering them jobs either but we're trying to provide them
B	with insights into what gets you a job
A	with insights into mm yeah I don't like yeah I wanna get away from it appearing to be a traditional thing
B	no I'm just saying that there's there is you we've gotta somehow scale it
A	so if you to start out erm with this I
B	no
A	you you would be
B	yeah
A	yeah? and and parallel to that you would be building er a series of these sessions these week long sessions okay?
B	mm
A	in the background and you might get them such that you've got
B	mm
A	okay? erm
B	yeah
A	you know there's something new coming guys
B	yeah
A	that'd be quite interesting and you can
B	mm
A	you were just talking about
B	mm
A	that there's a box set of six of these case studies together
B	mm
A	and you can put a price on it and what you would do initially is the price that you would put on it would be with the aim of drawing in er a
B	mm mm
A	because you're just starting out
B	yeah okay that
A	that kind of yeah
B	that sounds like a good jump because you can get feedback from your market
B	because if they're gonna part with five dollars or ten dollars to go and see what the answer is you know to watch the case study in its entirety erm and then er get the solution you know so it's actually kind of modelling things like critical thinking
A	absolutely but you can build that
B	why we say
A	within the line of a
B	yeah
A	blog a Facebook
B	you can
B	but you can also say
A	let out all sorts of different ones
B	we're just part of your personal learning network
A	yeah
B	we're just a a node
A	mm
B	on something you're building yourself
A	mm
B	but
A	exactly
B	because we're showing you actually how to grow it
A	mm mm
B	so you need us we need you
A	yes
B	that sort of thing
A	mm uh-mm
B	and there is the some students work off the erm I I'm you know I wanna share I'm very altruistic you know I just wanna get my story out there so they're coming in going yeah I wanna be the community once you're inside the community you are then allowed to actually offer up your story I say allowed but you are invited and then you can start to shape it by thinking oh who's going to be the
A	mm
B	I mean I'm I'm convinced that there are students out there who could just drive the whole thing if you let them
A	mm mm mm
B	some would need more help than others
A	and I think that's where your skill comes is that you are seeking to erm
B	yeah
A	and and
B	yeah
A	and there you go
B	we we don't succeed every time yeah
A	we've got all of these takeaways
B	yeah
A	that we can say well next time we would look at it like this and we'd look at it like that and actually erm what we've found out is this particular problem that none of us really had any awareness about
B	yeah
A	and so that is a big learning message for everyone
B	yeah
A	and so there's a great thing to take out of it
B	yeah yeah yeah that's good because you you wanna get let them
A	mm
B	as you use it to succeed
A	yes to build upon something
B	yeah
A	for the next stage and and for a a a better solution next time
B	yeah I've actually got some theory about how that to back that up too not that they might be all that interested in that but anyway erm so yeah I think there's you know a number of ideas worth exploring there erm and it's really gonna be finding the right people to engage with to kick it off and trial it with and you know
A	yeah for sure
B	and do the whole thing
A	well the
B	yeah
A	and they're trying to explore themselves through their own learning network
B	yeah
A	so they are examples of the people
B	mm
A	changing paths and you can let that threat run through the whole lot of all this stuff
B	mm
A	and find out where this goes
B	mm
A	and we want to trial we'll get in touch with you every two months and we'll get an update and we'll do a little blah-blah-blah and we can connect with you through you know we can provide you exposure to your site through ours
B	mm mm
A	et cetera and we'll get you to be a bit of a guest and you can write a little piece for us
B	mm
A	and that's what we want as well we want people who do producing stuff for us
B	yeah so the so we've got some teasing elements to tease people into the community but the subscription to start off with with the model is to have a student base subscription and to show popularity that people are actually parting with their money to come into the community and get for example
A	yeah well
B	that is
A	that is yeah erm
B	well there'll have to be some reason for them to part with their money cos I mean what I've noticed is that there's a lot of people giving stuff out for free out there
A	yeah well they're doing freemium you see so what they're doing is that they give you something to start with
B	mm
A	and that on the side of that you've got this thing so the people come in here you give them back something for free and with that connection you you're teaching them about this which is you have to pay money to have a part of this
B	yeah
A	and and it's gonna take time to to build that momentum but what you'll get is you will get a few er you know the the classic model of the people who are interested the the the newbies are will always go on there and then you've got the main crowd quite a bit later and the you know and then you've got the slow runners
B	yeah
A	later on
B	yeah
A	so it's exactly that kind of model erm
B	mm
A	and actually what time we really wanna get this thing to be connected so we're getting some money in the door
B	mm
A	now
B	yeah
A	of this is what this is
B	yeah
A	erm online and at that six month period you might then start to introduce the idea of if you've got this paid thing going on
B	yeah
A	yeah? erm or it er might even be a longer period but
B	yeah
A	instead
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	and then you have to figure who's what roles people are gonna play
A	you yeah you
B	er do we need just me or you? do we need a web developer? do we need a content creator?
A	mm
B	you know do we need a film person to edit stuff? you know what what's the list of resources we need?
B	and how much is that gonna cost to start up with?
A	er exactly erm and
B	mm
A	so we need to run something effectively before we can do that
B	mm
A	we need we need to demonstrate that's er the idea works
B	mm
A	okay? er
B	mm
A	it's somewhere between five and ten I think at the moment that is at a small level and he's trying his hardest to to to cut it down to the bare bones to see whether it has some kind of traction
B	mm
A	now you can argue well if you added that and added that you might get a bigger picture
B	yeah I think we'll know when we're gonna start hitting the scalability because we'll have to work on
A	yes
B	and then we can start going and knocking on doors
A	well the other part of it is is trying to find mechanisms to draw people in to do stuff erm you know on on a cheap and voluntary basis
B	yeah
A	erm whether it's they are relative experts that you get guest bloggers to do stuff you people like the students you know to do a couple of free edits for for some videos
B	yeah
A	erm that we actively outsource some stuff and maybe build a connection where we're getting stuff done for cheap cheap from somewhere
B	yeah
A	erm and
B	and also the legal stuff
A	yeah and there's a guy who's a part of the Location Rebel community who erm is he's a international lawyer bloke
B	yeah
A	we'll start thinking
B	mm
A	who have some kind of
B	media
A	I get I get the first thing Australia's gotta be one of the most expensive places to actually get any of this stuff done
B	which
A	anything everything
B	just cos resources cost a lot of money
A	just bloody everything yeah
B	mm
A	so so
B	but we have to demo it to start off with
A	that's right
B	you know we've gotta make sure that it we've gotta be confident that
A	mm
B	our ideas are gonna work
A	yeah
B	and that then we can start thinking about well shifting it say offshore or something like that but we've gotta have the technology
A	well you've got your mate down the road who's who's er
B	yeah
A	but
B	yeah
A	to get that kind of context of how much does it cost to build one of these? you know and you could go and pick an example off the net and say how much do you reckon it cost them to do that?
B	yeah
A	alright erm
B	well I'm hoping that we can work with people we we form a good relationship with erm you know I know that they are probably go wanna go off and do their own things which suits me fine because
A	yeah and they're getting some exposure et cetera et cetera
B	and as long as it's kind of going up their alley like you know
A	mm
A	mm
B	but to keep him kind of around and about and interested you know
A	what about
A	thinking a different picture
A	or maybe his connections
B	mm erm
A	it's things like that you know
B	he's I'll tell you what he's good at he'd er he'd review it for you he'd evaluate it and be very
A	mm
B	honest
A	yeah okay
B	constructive
A	alright well we
B	mm
A	and kicks you in the butt
B	mm he's good at reviewing things
A	and throws in a bit of a a wobbler at you every now and again
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	mm
B	he's good like that and then erm
A	yeah it's kind of a case of at what stage
B	she's
A	you get all that stuff sorted
B	yeah but she's worth asking she's just that she'll just sort of say well do do you work with people or a company?
A	mm
B	I mean this is another thing where you you're using their personal learning network
A	yeah yeah
B	to find out stuff that you need to know yourself
A	yeah
B	at no cost
A	absolutely
B	to start with
A	uh-huh
B	and then you reach erm at the end of the no cost and you have to then pay for it
A	and presumably there are some kind of cheap bizzo type stuff that you can get your nose into
B	yeah
A	yeah yeah you know erm that all comes down to detail but I think first we I think what we said the other day was cos tomorrow's Tuesday morning are we gonna do anything beyond what we've just done?
B	no I don't think so
A	no
B	I think we've gotta we've gotta now just get a feasibility plan together
A	so I think we'll have a look at what we've got in front of us
B	yeah
A	let's see if anything else pops up and er get some kind of map-out down
B	yeah
A	erm
B	get some people signed up for this thing
A	and yeah it's it's the marketing type stuff as well to not marketing it's market research erm
B	alright
A	one that
B	it makes me think of mother's little helper
A	yeah but it's just an example of
B	well we'll talk about that another time
A	that kind that kind of thing
B	I'm too tired to think about it
A	a brainstorm of
B	well I'm sure they do but I thought about that in on Sunday morning and basically
A	yeah I know I know it just
B	we just bought it
A	yeah
B	somebody will have it at some point they'll buy it off us but at the moment that's what it's called
A	yeah I don't wanna
B	cos it's need to have a name
A	run anything on it
B	okay
A	because
A	yeah I I agree with you've gotta crack on
B	mm
A	erm
B	I think you've gotta test it amongst the age group I don't think you and I could make a decision alone on a name until
A	mm
B	you've actually really tested it out there I don't think that's fair to the people that potentially might quite like it
A	what would be more rather than Port of Cool Port of Call is isn't such a bad idea
B	yeah alright
A	eh?
B	cos my brain's just gone into meltdown
A	okay alright shall we see whether this actually recorded any of that?
B	yeah I'm going for a wee
A	okay wee-wee
