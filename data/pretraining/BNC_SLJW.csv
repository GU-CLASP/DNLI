C	okay

C	I think it's a mile
D	you're both wrong
C	how far is it?
D	something in kilometres
A	ah
B	ah
A	plus
B	we're on eight now
A	I think we're about
B	one eight now but that wasn't a kilometre so
D	we're on point one
B	we're probably towards the end of
D	we're on point one so far
B	oh did you press the mileometer? we're on nought point two
A	I dunno I'd say one yeah
B	you said one I'm going two kilometres
C	are you saying kilometres or miles
B	we're on nought point three already it's definitely
A	kilometres
B	gonna be two
B	we'll we're just guessing kilometres you place your bet now
C	no I
C	no I
B	one I'm two
C	I'd say a mile
D	two and half
B	you say a mile? dad says two and a half kilometres I say two kilometres
C	how does that compare to miles
D	I can't remember exactly
A	er excuse me I was also
B	purely from our brains
C	you and you were
A	it's gotta be one I'm telling
B	it's not gonna be one
D	we're
A	yeah we're nearly there
B	no we're not
B	I think I'm gonna be bang on
A	fine one point five
B	no you've placed your bet now you can't
A	no
B	change your mind
A	I didn't I said one mile
B	you can't no you just you said a kilometre
A	oh right okay then okay
B	not allowed to change your mind
A	it's got nothing to do with that
B	you can't do that
A	one point five I'm telling you
B	no
A	one point five
B	you're not
A	yes I am mum just said yes
B	no you're not
C	I didn't
B	everyone locked in their bets
A	so if is say it's not gonna be two point five is it? that's a fair point
D	well no
B	I think I'm gonna be
A	it's gonna be one point five
B	I'm gonna be right
D	well
A	well what
C	and then I want to convert it
D	well it's only gonna be one point five
B	what were you betting?
D	it's gonna be one point four
B	one mile?
C	one mile yeah
A	so I I I'm the winner cos I was the closest then
C	you move the goalposts all the time you're a Jew

C	no devotees converts
D	yogis?
C	yeah converted to yogism
A	do you think he's the leader?
