A	so good stuff
B	dunno
A	yeah
B	wasn't a riveting topic of conversation
A	no it wasn't
B	to start on
A	ah
B	yes
A	no I mean as as in as an event not the food was fine but the um
B	yeah
A	was quite nice
A	yeah it is
B	yeah
B	well no it's marginally safer for us but and therefore them
A	I always think
B	sorry?
B	mm
A	A town where it rains
B	this is just such a frustrating road
B	aha
B	wow
A	exactly
B	where would they go to?
A	just away
B	uh
A	ah the bus
B	how long does it take?
A	um
B	wow
A	yeah
B	but you'd think they'd have the bus which went straight there and then a bus that did some of them and then bus that did the others
A	I
A	yeah
B	there's not many other transport links to Durham
A	no
A	er as it I mean as it happens it's relatively handy for us cos we live so close to
B	that's clever
A	that's a stupid sign
B	what?
A	there's a house a sign for a housing development saying if you lived here you'd be home by now
A	I know
B	well er so there's a
A	oh a trainline?
B	yeah
A	fair enough
B	the
B	which is sort of five minutes away
B	so actually it's probably at the bare minimum a quarter of an hour
B	by which time I'll be home anyway
B	so
A	nice
B	yeah at most living there would save me five minutes
A	mm
B	and the surrounding neighbourhood looks like a shithole
B	and I know this cos I take the train through there every day
B	indeed
A	quite busy on the twenty tonight
B	yes
A	yay
B	oh dear
B	this this bit of
A	mm
B	boring
B	yay
B	living it up tonight
A	oh yeah
B	cathedral?
A	Durham Cathedral
B	oh right
A	not Sunderland cathedral
B	I was gonna say
A	no there isn't
B	and yet it is a city just
A	it's got a minster
B	that sounds very camp
A	does it?
B	mincer
A	oh right
B	well it must do
A	yeah
B	mm
A	it might not have been a cathedral
B	so the original logic for placing cathedrals was just where are there enough people we can screw over
A	yeah
B	to get enough money to build this thing?
A	yeah
B	oo cities
A	yeah
A	areas where there's already lots of people
B	sorry?
A	areas where there's already lots of people
B	well to some extent you got people making pilgrimages
A	mm
B	and just sort of not having any money to get home
B	I doubt that was a
A	well you er er there would be a tourism industry
B	wow
A	well yeah
B	in fifteen hundred
B	on their jollies?
A	jollies
B	oh right
B	I'm so glad that this bit of road is forty
B	this is the right speed for this road
B	there's er a bit of road on my work way to work that's a fifty
B	it is conceivably at least to do with a section of road they haven't put as a fifty
A	yeah
B	no I just think they're utterly retarded
B	the work experience kid'd be far too sensible
B	but
A	maybe local pressure?
B	but from who? No one lives along that section
B	I mean the only other logic I can see is that there's a pub on that section
A	mm
B	so that's hardly an issue
A	no er
B	I'd have thought a speed camera would've
A	I was gonna say it's a little bit kind of er ridiculous
B	mm
A	mm
B	so doesn't make a huge difference
A	mm
B	uh
A	oh really? I've never really noticed it before
B	location's not brilliant
A	no
B	as in where you live is er quite nice cos it's feasible to walk into the centre
A	yeah
B	not so much
A	no
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	mm
A	oh it's a Nissan as well
B	it's a Nissan Juke
A	did you see the er the newscast of them getting all the extra jobs?
B	yes
A	Cos they're gonna build the next
B	excuse me
A	in er
B	forty
A	mm
A	they were just rubbish
B	oh got it
B	oh dear
A	yeah
B	that's just been a short driving distance but nonetheless
A	it's gone very quick hasn't it
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	oo
A	you don't think this Juke'll be speedy?
B	well not if there's a car in front of us
B	and this car's very quick from standstill
A	hm
B	sorry?
A	Good lyric
B	that being said
A	damn it
B	bollocks
B	well it's four-wheel drive
A	mm
B	and it's probably an automatic
B	so between the two that will help
B	ten to thirty
A	yeah
B	we're still moving
B	I think so
A	I'm not starving
B	probably have should have something or we'll feel very bad in the morning
A	no er I agree
B	no
B	so there's an interesting tip here
A	mm
B	do so
A	mm
B	yeah
A	uh
B	what?
A	stiff back?
B	my back's not too bad actually
A	no? Cool
B	okay
B	we're good
A	yeah
