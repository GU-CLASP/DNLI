C	we went
C	you know like at midnight or whatever like me and
E	this was in

C	the story goes
A	yeah
C	so we went back
C	all the stuff was missing all that was there was like
B	ah
C	one of like
C	and we were like
B	naked and very depressed
C	fuck er I think maybe you two like put the scarf on or something and I just walked naked or like had something else
A	no
A	no what happened was that that my clothes were there so I was like right cos er cos you know it's my like patch or whatever so I was
C	no hold on
A	it's a bit
C	hold on the the story's going way too fast
A	oh sorry
C	like this
E	it's a long one
C	this er well yeah no yeah no it'll be over in five minutes but like
A	you you had to wrap yourself in the scarf
C	no so we walked past
B	what? you left the girls naked and you wrapped yourself in the scarf?
A	no I was dressed
C	I was like girls let's just sit here and like
A	I don't remember what happened to
C	basically see what happens
C	and then anyway so we walked past the caravans where there was like a football team and like they weren't outside they were inside and they I'd
B	and you were wrapped in a scarf?
C	noticed them on the way and so I'm pretty sure I'm like I'm pretty sure they
A	no I went and talked to them didn't I?
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	cos you were wearing the clothes
A	before the police came
C	and you were like you were like guys
E	she's wearing
C	did you did you guys take anything? and they were laughing loads like er fucking like ten dudes and like
A	yeah like super like
E	me and
A	super
B	oh no
A	super
C	yeah and they they were like
A	like really rough
A	just like laughing
C	so there was this new hotel on this like otherwise really nice beachfront or whatever we went in there and they're like er
A	these silk silk pyjamas
C	and I got I got this I got these like
A	what are we gonna do without any clothes?
A	yeah
C	I dunno this is the okay
C	so so they
B	the silk PJs?
C	yeah yeah and like I'm pretty sure it was like a rugby top or something it was like a rugby top and like silk bottoms
A	yeah
C	and then
C	you've ever met and they were like are you sure you lost it? and we're like yes we like we went for a swim and we left it and he's like
C	have you checked the beach? and we were like yeah yeah we of course we have erm so they went around with a torch for a bit in the dunes and like
C	didn't find anything
C	and then they were just like so we were we're on bikes and it's like two miles back to the house
C	going in like odd clothes like cycling and they were driving at like two miles an hour
A	one of the other funny funny parts was when I called the police station the woman was like ah sure no problem now I'll send the lads down
A	and I was
C	they were like sixty
A	sixty-year-old dudes
A	like when they turned up
A	they were like you're joking now? you you're er you're er you're pulling our legs
C	yeah
A	we literally don't have any
C	yeah
B	so what? oh
C	so basically no passport no money from
C	all of our wallets were gone cos the the point of the story is we got back they let er we couldn't get in
A	no yeah
C	they helped break in
C	they broke into that house
A	so they
C	and then we got up
B	lolz
C	in the morning and it was like I was like quite a heavy smoker at the time and was like I had no cigarettes and no money
A	oh god
C	no like
A	it was so bad
C	and so like I think I had to like we had to ask
A	oh yeah
C	a mile into the countryside and she just had like two packs of cigarettes and like
B	oh my god
C	some flour and I was just like I really need some cigarettes and she was like
A	she was really
C	I was just like I fucking need them like
C	we know
A	really scary woman who

C	in the end
A	she she's like super like
C	no
A	fucking weird looking
C	no she didn't she wouldn't give any credit
A	no
C	and then we had to cycle no shit ten miles
A	yeah we
C	to the to the next town took half the fucking day to get there
C	then
A	I went went around
A	asking for cigarettes off people
A	it was really fucked man
B	ah you guys
A	cos
C	I'm like I just can't do it
C	I never ask for cigarettes I've always had my own
A	I I
B	oh
A	like when er
C	yeah she was like she said nothing
A	I've known that woman since I was a tiny weeny little girl and she's never spoken to me she's absolutely
C	cos
A	terrifying one of those like mad like fat like witchy looking women who always wears a man's shirt and like has stubble and smells of smoke like really scary and erm yeah she she wouldn't even do us that
B	she wouldn't do it?
A	to to finish the story so our passports were taken which was
C	yeah but you
A	and then
C	didn't have jobs I had to get back to a job so I had to catch like a ten-hour bus
A	yeah
C	a ferry and hope that the terminal cos sometimes
A	they
C	they check your passport going back into
B	oh
A	they don't always check but
A	yeah but but then
E	they didn't check? they didn't check?

E	I mean if they were running you would never catch them
C	that's true
A	yeah
E	you'd just like it's such a
B	taking advantage completely when you're distracted it sucks

E	and then
A	that's pretty
B	he's walking down the street and he sees a
B	and erm

A	yeah or just really boring I guess it's not you don't buy it for the jokes though you don't read it for the jokes
E	you don't really buy
A	no no but there is er there is like a quality and importance in recipes that you would probably never cook but you would still read like that's still really valid
C	yeah yeah it's like getting your understanding of
A	yeah and also it's good if if you're interested in like where recipes come from and the like history and development of certain styles and ways of cooking then it's really
E	yeah
A	interesting definitely
B	also like you're quite into like old recipes and stuff aren't you?
