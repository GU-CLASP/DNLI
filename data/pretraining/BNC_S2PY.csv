A	but the the the actual chicken was
B	mm
A	pathetic
C	yeah
A	and these bantam type chickens are they are they're
B	that's er I mean they're chickens you eat they're only
A	yeah yeah
B	you know I mean no one if you're gonna eat a chicken
C	mm
B	you've got er nine months is about the limit ain't it I think
A	that is yeah
C	mm
B	I think they're ready in
A	yeah that's right some chickens are yeah
C	yeah they do
B	and er I didn't believe it
A	yeah
C	how did they make them grow that big?
B	well feed them full of hormones don't they
C	exactly yeah you have to keep thinking this don't you?
B	yeah
A	you can prove that because American men started growing breasts and they found that was the hormones that the chicken made
B	yeah that's right
B	but that's all but I mean
C	mm
B	turkeys right? what they have for Christmas right?
A	yeah
B	they don't get them in till
A	that's right yeah
B	and there's a lot of
C	and then
A	they're huge turkeys
B	a lot of a lot of growth to put on by Christmas isn't it?
C	yeah mm
A	but if you if you keep one yourself that wouldn't be big enough to eat would it?
B	dunno I I'm I'm er
C	no we've never tried that have we?
A	no
C	but
A	I'd like to
B	well those those er cocks you
A	oh yeah
B	we actually killed they were quite tasty weren't they?
A	yeah they were
B	absolutely gorgeous
A	they were
B	I mean they were they were about nine months weren't they?
A	they they were nice they were
C	yeah
A	they were nice big chickens weren't they?
B	mm
C	perhaps we had bad luck with the other one we picked the other day
B	well them ones that were round the back I mean they could be two or three year old
C	yeah
A	but yeah that could be yeah
B	you know
C	yeah
B	they're gonna be tough
A	they're going to be as tough as old boots ain't they?
B	mm
A	but pheasants aren't are they?
B	well pheasants are
A	they're all about a year though aren't they? when they
B	yeah they are a bit tough though aren't they?
A	yeah they are a bit tough I don't like pheasants myself
B	I don't particularly like em myself
A	no
B	no
A	yeah
B	we visited some people we know and they'd bought oven-ready pigeons on
A	oh right yeah?
B	and they were absolutely gorgeous
A	were they? yeah?
C	mm
B	yeah
A	that's a dark meat ain't it?
B	like you get like you get one each you know
A	yeah
C	mm
B	and there's plenty of meat on a
B	and it's surprising you think that that you know a chicken that small there'd be nothing of it
A	yeah that's right
B	but pigeons like the pigeon breast
A	yeah
B	is a whacking great bit of meat
C	yeah
A	that's a dark bit of meat ain't it?
B	yeah yeah
C	mm
B	but I mean it's big you know what I mean? and
A	yeah yeah
C	yeah
B	you think you've got pigeon you'd be picking away with a toothpick trying to find something to eat on it
A	yeah that's right yeah
B	but there's there's
C	mm
A	I know we used to have pigeon pie
B	mm
A	when we were kids my mum used to do a pigeon pie
B	mm
A	well they used meat was on ration apparently until nineteen fifty-three so we used to have some of that sort of stuff
B	mm
A	yeah I come home one day we had we we used to have pet rabbits
B	mm
A	well I thought they were pets
B	mm
C	yeah
A	yeah yeah
B	but my dad you know when
A	yeah yeah
B	right? opposite the cathedral
A	yeah
B	he
A	oh right yeah
B	and then they'd have and that was in the days when they had this big old er
A	yeah
B	and I can remember driving to
A	yeah
B	sitting in the back of this Rolls-Royce
B	and there'd be this big pile with about a dozen dead rabbits
B	you know they tied the back legs
A	yeah yeah they did yeah
C	mm
B	and they'd all be sort of like dry blood on them and stuff
A	that's it yeah yeah
C	yeah mm
B	why I was sitting in the back I don't know
C	mm
B	but they were just sort of like there's probably a couple of
A	yeah
B	in the back of this Rolls-Royce
C	yeah
A	yeah
B	just to take to
C	oh dear
A	the last last rabbit I had
C	weird isn't it?
B	people people were
C	yeah
B	er complain about dead animals hanging up outside shops now don't they?
A	they do don't they? yeah
C	mm
B	mm
A	they used to have whole pigs hanging there didn't they?
B	yeah they did
A	yeah
B	and they used to be like the the er advert weren't it? pig's head in the
A	it was yeah
B	in the window
C	mm
A	that's right yeah my friend
A	er
C	yeah
A	and he had er whole sides of beef come in you know and he used to
B	mm
A	just hang em up in his cold room at the back er but you could see them
B	yeah well they
A	yeah they do yeah
B	yeah
A	mm
C	mm
B	on that one down in
A	mm yeah
C	yeah
B	but the the place the butchers what used to be where the mobile phone shop is now
A	yeah
B	they used to have pheasants and things hanging up
A	they did didn't they? yeah
B	outside didn't they?
A	yeah
C	mm
A	yeah they did
B	and rabbits and I'm sure they had all sorts of stuff
A	they had well yeah it was a game shop wasn't it?
B	the game yeah
A	yeah
C	mm
A	that was yeah shame that went
B	sometimes had half a deer hanging up or a deer hanging up
C	oh dear
A	oh dear oh dear
A	oh dear
C	don't fancy that I don't mind the small stuff so much but
A	well I dunno we had we had a deer
C	yeah I know we did but I wouldn't want to see it hanging up outside a shop
A	well you saw it hanging up in
B	yeah but I mean the thing is when they
C	that's
B	when they deliver the half of a cow and half a pig and that
C	mm
B	when the lorry pulls up
A	yeah
B	they just sort of carry it in
A	over the shoulder yeah they do it
B	over the shoulder
B	mm
C	mm
C	mm
B	I dunno why people people are so erm
C	squeamish?
C	mm
A	I don't know why
C	mm
B	it used to fascinate me when my mum used to gut a chicken or a rabbit
A	yeah
B	but she wouldn't let me watch she was sort of
C	yeah
B	but no I've never been
C	mm
B	I sort of have to work myself up to it
A	yeah
B	to sort of gut something or something like that or
A	I do
B	but on the other hand I'm not squeamish about it
A	no
B	once I get going the same with like cleaning fish ain't it?
A	that is ain't it? yeah
B	you know I mean
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	some people I suppose couldn't do that could they?
A	no no
C	I don't like the smell of meat very much
B	mm
A	I don't like the smell of dead chicken that's that's
B	yeah
A	quite awful the smell of chicken ain't it?
C	mm yeah mm
B	but thinking about that do you think if you were you were cleaning something like fairly small like like
A	yeah
C	mm
A	no
B	but er you'd be so much more sort of like urgh
A	but you'd think
C	yeah yeah
A	mm mm
C	yeah yeah
B	that's something that you've got sort of like a bit of
A	that's right
B	mm
B	cos it is quite interesting ain't it? when you're sort of looking at the innards of something
C	mm
A	well I find er
B	yeah
A	and inside this hen it had every egg it was going to lay
B	mm
A	and they come they start off fairly big when there's hardly any a soft shell
B	mm
A	going down down down down down down down down until you get right to this little pinprick of a bit
B	right
A	and that and apparently that's every egg it's ever going to lay
B	mm
A	is already in there
C	mm
A	in there
B	so once it's laid them all
C	mm
A	that's it
B	but I mean chickens lay hundreds thousands of eggs don't they?
A	they do lay

B	mm
A	but
C	mm
A	I mean
A	and he'll take it
B	mm
A	and he's the younger brother
C	well he's always been the best out of the three of us
A	he has he's been brilliant he er well I dunno you're alright
B	yeah
C	he's the intelligent one out of us
B	yeah
A	he is very intelligent yeah
C	mm
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	but he he can he can hold his own with any argument
B	mm
A	though can't he? seemed to know everything about everything I don't know
B	I used to be like that but as I get older I realise
B	knowledge as I should be
A	yeah I know a little about everything and mostly it's wrong
B	mm
C	well because he er he's he has to deal with different things I mean he does training courses for like the fire brigade right?
B	mm
C	and then he does training courses for schools and and St John's Ambulance and
A	I mean he has to travel
C	where he has to help them out you know
A	and he's very busy all the time and
C	yeah
A	and his wife told him he can't retire well it ain't his wife is it? it's his partner
C	yeah
B	mm
A	told him he can't retire she's a
C	yeah
A	and er
C	but
A	you know they they
C	for the last was it about six years?
B	mm
C	he's always had one at university
A	yeah
C	and he thought this year it's gonna be different
A	yeah
C	but erm because er the son that he'd been doing doctor's degree he finishes this year and the one that finished college about two years ago she's going back
A	two years ago
A	he's coughing up for her
B	mm
A	but
C	so he's had a
B	mm
A	well it's nine
A	about nine thousand pound now
C	a lot of
B	yeah but they get grants and that
A	not when you got money like they've got
B	yeah but I mean you get grants for tuition you don't get grants for maintenance
C	mm yeah mm
B	you know but I mean quite a few people who earn a lot of money they'd rather pay it than have the
A	yeah
B	the kids in debt right?
A	yeah that's right yeah
C	mm yeah
B	you know there's a lot of people like
C	which is what he's done
A	that's what he's done
B	there's a lot of people who
A	otherwise you just have to get loans don't you?
A	yeah
B	you know their mummies and daddies paid all everything off as they went
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	whereas
A	they're still paying off
B	yeah well it's same as
C	erm yeah
B	I think
C	I don't know about
B	twenty grand or something
A	yeah?
C	yeah awful ain't it?
C	yeah
B	god knows how many thousand
C	yeah
A	it's ridiculous really ain't it?
C	shame ain't it?
C	but they were conned really weren't they? cos it was it was supposed to be nought percent finance and then they stick on
A	three percent
B	well this is it they start you know depends when you took your grant out
A	yeah
B	like er you know your loan cos it started out at nought percent
A	yeah that's right
B	interest right?
C	mm
A	yeah
B	straight two percent then they said oh well then it's
B	something you know cost of whatever it is I don't know
C	yeah inflation
B	inflation
C	mm
B	plus something else
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	when people who work you know because when it started off it was only five thousand a year weren't it?
A	yeah yeah
B	now it's nine thousand
A	well if you if you work out
C	mm
A	they they've put it up to three percent I think you've gotta pay and it started off at at nothing and now it's three percent
B	mm
A	well if if you're going to university now and you spent and that cost you nine thousand quid or something like that to go three percent of nine thousand pound per year ain't it?
B	well the thing is it's not just
C	mm
B	nine thousand that's just tuition
A	yeah
B	you need another five grand on top of that
A	well you do yeah
C	yeah
B	just to pay your rent
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	yeah
B	so that's fourteen thousand a year
C	mm
B	you know and the thing is before the interest only started when you finished
A	yeah
B	now the interest starts as soon as you take it out
A	as soon as you take it out yeah
B	I mean it's just er I dunno what the the idea of it is cos I mean the government are losing millions on it
C	mm
B	you know the scheme
A	yeah
B	and it's just the way er cos like
A	yeah
B	so the university
A	yeah
B	and seventy percent are not and the government has to pay that back
A	yeah course they do
C	mm
B	and so they you know it's just a matter of going round the houses the government are still paying
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	mm
A	weird
B	how do you mean?
A	well the interest on em
B	well what happened is
B	is that when you earn more than
C	fifteen thousand isn't it or something?
B	is it fifteen or sixteen thousand?
C	yeah
A	oh then you have to start paying back
B	you then pay back a proportion equivalent you know it's a proportion of what you earn
A	yeah
B	is something like five percent of everything above sixteen thousand
A	oh right
B	or maybe less or more but
C	mm
B	it's it's just like paying an extra income tax really
C	mm
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	it's just that you get sixteen thousand tax free and then you pay above the rest
A	yeah
B	so you know if you're earning cos you know the theory was that everyone who finished university would get
A	would gotta get a good job
B	would get a job and you know thirty grand
C	yeah
B	start off at thirty grand so they could easily afford it
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	but they suddenly realise that if half the population
C	yeah
B	have got a degree
B	there ain't that many jobs that are you know paying that money
A	no
B	I mean
C	they drop out anyway don't they? mm
C	yeah
B	mm
A	I mean she
C	well she worked for
B	mm
C	and then er because digital came out just after she finished
A	yeah just after she'd finished her photography
B	mm
C	yeah
A	then it become digital
C	so it's totally different really
A	so everything was different
B	yeah
A	so she was no good at photography
C	and then yeah
B	yeah yeah
C	mm
A	yeah
B	but I mean this was the same with
C	mm
B	I mean she did a degree and never used it
A	yeah
C	yeah yeah
A	but
B	mm
B	well same with
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	she don't particularly like it cos it's sort of
A	well
B	you know sort of like just boring you know what I mean?
C	yeah
B	yeah exactly
C	yeah
B	but I mean like all these jobs there's no
C	yeah
B	not exactly very testing are they?
A	no
B	you know you just go in
A	that's right
B	what have you achieved today?
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	yeah they might have to be moving to Florida shortly mightn't they?
C	yeah
B	oh dear oh dear
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	you know you have to go there you have to go there
B	wage slaves aren't they?
A	yeah
C	mm
B	but I mean this is the thing unless you're gonna be self-employed you can't be anything but
C	yeah
A	well
C	mm
A	I think I'd I I wouldn't I wouldn't have paid anything
A	and what have you I don't even know how much we had to pay for self-employment
C	not a lot really coming for what you mean er stamps?
A	for stamps and stuff
C	mm it wasn't too bad mm I wish I'd paid more
A	you should've paid more yeah
C	yeah
A	well you can still pay six seven hundred quid and get it
B	well why don't you?
C	yeah maybe
B	well the thing is if you work out
C	yeah
B	how much extra you'll get a week
C	yeah I know
A	how long you're going to live
B	how many years you're gonna live
C	yeah
B	and then see if it's more or less than this other money
A	yeah
B	you know however much it costs
A	yeah
C	yeah maybe I should
B	you know and and quite often it's quite a good deal
A	mm
B	that that you know if it just pushes
C	mm
B	you over the
A	yeah
C	mm
A	you only get about eighty quid don't you?
C	mm
A	ain't a lot is it?
B	no
C	no
A	used to be a lot
C	yeah
A	in nineteen sixty
B	hardly fill the car up with petrol these days would it?
C	but it's
C	more than they'd get in child
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	mm
C	mm
B	but I mean yeah on your erm
C	yeah
B	on your er erm
C	erm apparently it started when the home protection thing
B	yeah
C	started when
A	it didn't count for
B	yeah but it still would've been
A	nineteen
B	but it still would have been sixteen years
C	but I was working all that time anyway
B	yeah
C	just had
B	oh right
C	so I got an exemption certificate
B	mm
C	to say because I've got such a low income
B	yeah
C	I didn't have to pay the insurance thing
A	no the stamp
C	and I think I was badly advised but there you are
B	yeah
C	I can't really say much about that I don't think
B	no but the er yeah
C	they just say
C	yeah we'll give you an exemption certificate
B	mm
C	cos of your low income
A	yeah
B	but that was the same thing when they had this sort of
A	no
C	yeah
B	you know if you if you sort of said oh well yeah I can save myself a fiver a week
A	yeah
B	but yeah
C	then at one time it was if you paid a stamp
B	mm
C	yeah wasn't it?
A	yeah
B	but you were quite you know in one way you were more lucky cos like as far as you're concerned you needed thirty years' stamps
A	yeah
C	mm
B	I mean from next year you're gonna need thirty-five years' stamps
A	that's right yeah
C	that's true
B	you know which is er been put you well out of the limit of
C	yeah true
A	yeah
B	but you know you really wanna sit down and work out this thing cos
C	yeah I do
B	it could work out
C	it just seems such a horrendous amount of money maybe it isn't
B	yeah but it's not not much in the in the scheme of things is it?
A	not really no
B	but it's like having it in the bank and
C	it depends how long
B	how long you're gonna be on
C	I live for
B	yeah well then you might live another thirty years
A	yeah that'd be handy
B	then you'd get your money back
A	you would get your money back then wouldn't you?
B	mm that's right you don't know you
A	no that's the gamble you
A	yeah
C	mm
A	yeah
B	you know you think well bloody hell one time you wouldn't think much more than seventy-five would you?
A	my dad sixty-three
B	my dad sixty-two my mum
A	yeah
B	my dad seventy-two
C	mm
A	my brother
B	mm
C	mm
B	well you've done quite well then haven't you?
A	well yeah
B	but I mean they keep anyone alive these days don't they?
A	yeah they do
C	mm
A	yeah
A	no resuscitation
B	going out going out for a walk up in some wild mountains or something
A	that's right yeah
B	and have a heart attack then then you've got not much chance but
A	no you haven't
B	yeah but I I've got absolutely no knowledge of her whatsoever
A	no
B	and she was supposed to be some national treasure
A	yeah
C	mm
B	forty years on Corrie
B	who the hell is she?
A	that's right
B	I don't even recognise her picture
C	well I've heard of her

A	well I know but we never watch soaps we
B	but I listen to The Archers which is bad enough
A	well I used to listen
B	oh my god that's got ridiculous it really has
A	has it?
C	has it?
B	absolutely ridiculous
C	yeah
B	you know like everyone has got some massive you know trauma in their lives
B	everyone and you think well
A	it used to be an everyday story of country folk
B	that's right and you think blooming countryside'd be like
A	yeah
C	yeah that's how erm Emmerdale got wasn't it? we
B	well Emmerdale used to be about the farming
C	way way back
B	now there is nothing at all about farming in it
C	nothing to do with no
C	we don't watch it but you hear little bits don't you?
A	yeah
B	well that's right occasionally well I mean
C	yeah
A	everyone get wiped out every now and then
B	mm
A	at the moment I think there's Coronation Street ain't it? we we
B	oh I saw the advert for it
A	the advert for that where the
C	yeah
A	the bus trip yeah
B	yeah oh
A	that's it that's that's all I've seen
A	the advert and the bus trip
B	it's like Eastenders
C	mm
B	if you ever had to tune in like might've been five years since you've seen the last one you can just pick it up straight away
B	it's all
A	mm yes yeah
B	they're now major characters you know like
A	yes yeah
B	running businesses and things like this
A	oh dear that's terrible ain't it that?
C	mm
A	I mean I did we did see er Eastenders when that first started I think we watched a little bit of that didn't we?
C	yes we did
B	mm
A	where where that was a proper storyline where the girl lost her baby and
C	it seemed like it to
A	well I dunno whether it is any more
A	yeah
C	mm
B	in that area of London
C	yeah
B	if you went there you wouldn't find anything remotely like
A	like it no
B	Eastenders you know
A	yeah
B	I mean it's like everything is like set in aspic from twenty years ago
A	I know yeah yeah
B	and there's nothing nothing is like that
A	you see I can't see where anybody in their right mind'd go to a neighbour next door where they go and shout and blaspheme at em then walk off and then have a coffee together
B	mm
A	or whatever in in
A	no
A	yeah market traders that's all they are
B	yeah
A	and there's just a few of them
C	pub
A	and then they there's a caff right outside the back the front door of the people and they all go and sit in the caff and have coffee and stuff get up and leave it cos they got
B	mm
A	oh I've gotta go and see so and so and so and so and they get up and leave their coffee or their dinner or whatever they're now eating
B	mm
A	and then
B	well I have have they still got the laundrette there?
A	oh I dunno about that one
C	yeah
B	cos I mean no even
A	is it?
C	is it?
B	no
C	I thought it was still open
B	no no no it's shut there's er a sort of like boutique shop there now
A	oh right
C	is it?
B	the one behind Argos
C	yeah
B	yeah no it's
C	I thought I saw it the other day I thought I saw someone going in there
A	you probably did
B	probably did
C	the other day yeah
B	the other day two years ago
A	two years ago
A	yeah
C	yeah I probably cut through mostly rather than go round it
A	er
B	mm
A	and up they come the the person who now cooked it open the bin and scrape it all into the bin well that annoyed me
A	food
B	leave it out for the pigeons
A	how they waste wasted food
B	mm well there's very little very little worth watching on TV
C	yeah
B	I'm I'm I'm back on the book er the books of the TV licencing authorities and that
A	are you?
B	for years they didn't hassle me you know
A	no
B	few years back they used to send me all these threatening letters and stuff like that
A	oh right
B	now I just chuck em in the bin and er just before Christmas they started sending me these letters again they're not quite as bad as they used to be but they are still threatening
C	mm
B	they don't tell you they don't actually point out you know the rules who who has to have a licence and who doesn't you know but they sort of
A	but you haven't got a telly have you?
B	no
A	no
B	no but if you watch you can watch telly on a computer now
A	you can you
B	you can get a card er
C	oh yeah
B	a telly
A	yeah
B	er erm receiver
A	yeah
B	on the back of your computer right? and also you can watch live telly streamed sometimes
A	oh you can
A	yeah yeah
B	and you er you aren't supposed to
A	yeah
B	or recorded
A	yeah
C	mm
B	stuff what's already been shown but it's not been shown live right?
A	mm
B	and they don't point that out you know in the letters and that
A	no
B	and you have to really suss out and I'm sure a lot of people you know old people you know buy a licence even if they don't need one
A	yeah probably do
A	yeah yeah
C	mm
B	but the thing is that all students well loads of students now because they've brought in this rule that if you have a house which is multiple occupation
C	mm
B	every person needs a licence don't they?
A	they did yeah yeah
B	you know unless it's like a a common
A	yeah
B	unless they're sort of lodgers sort of type thing
A	yeah
B	but if you've got a a door what you can lock you need a licence
A	yeah
C	oh right
B	and so all the students now just watch Iplayer they don't bother to watch anything live
A	well no yeah why should they?
C	yeah
B	and you sort of think well if BBC don't like it
C	yeah
A	yeah
B	you know
C	it shouldn't be should it? no
B	you know and things like you can buy
C	no
B	with your broadband now you can get all these sort of these schemes where you can watch playback TV
A	you can yeah
B	there's no reason to watch live TV any more
A	no no
C	no
B	and even on Iplayer when I sort of
C	yeah
B	sometimes in the evening I'm sitting there and think oh I'm bored I'll
A	no no
B	you know?
C	no
B	well anyway they send you these letters saying oh you know you've got to write to us and tell us whether or not you got a licence or whether or not you got a television
C	mm
A	why?
B	why should I?
A	yeah why should you?
B	you know you don't get the the er Broads Authority writing saying have you got a fishing licence?
B	and you don't get the
C	mm
B	police writing saying have you got a gun licence?
A	no
B	you know you just
A	no
B	take it if you haven't got it you don't need a licence
A	that's right
B	so why and course this is run by Capita
A	oh course
B	right?
A	well there you go
B	and they reckon I was reading up about it and they reckon that these people who like the operatives they got some name for em you know the
A	yeah
B	the
A	a bonus yeah
B	er you know if they catch someone without a licence
A	yeah
C	mm
A	I said I saw the
A	for the first time in ages that licence van going around the other day
A	yeah with their with that little
C	mm
A	aerial thing on
B	mm
A	going round and round
C	mm
B	but the thing is er wasn't there something that they didn't work anyway?
A	yeah
B	you know they sort of say oh we can detect this and that
A	that's right and and they
B	and they say well when you open em up there's nothing in em
A	and they they said they could detect what you are even watching
B	yeah that's right
C	mm
A	and er I saw one going through
B	mm
A	and I thought oh yeah
B	but these these people cos now I'm on the er investigation I've been reported to the investigation team now
A	oh right
B	so I can expect a visit any time
C	ah
B	and er then I was looking up and seeing what rights these people have got okay absolutely no rights whatsoever
A	no?
B	you know
C	mm
B	you can just tell em get off
A	yeah
B	get off my land
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	mm
A	oh good
B	and er
A	cos I got a gun licence
B	yeah
B	you know but then they can go away and get a warrant
A	yeah they can yeah
B	you know
A	yeah
B	and then you you know you know they er they can get a warrant and you know come round with the police and inspect your house
C	mm
A	and supposing you've got a television but that's not plugged in
B	yeah well you see
C	no that you still
B	people people do this they say
C	yeah
B	they find the
C	that's not allowed either
B	well it is it is if it's not plugged in and it's detuned
A	yeah
B	cos people use a television to watch videos right?
C	videos yeah
A	that's right yeah
B	they connect the video player up to the television
A	yeah
C	mm
B	but what they have to do is to detune it
B	so that it can't receive you know
B	so you can't push a button and
C	that's it
B	and see
A	couldn't you just twiddle em and and not have any programmes on?
B	that's right yeah you can get rid of the programmes
A	yeah
B	and er but that's allowed you see
C	oh
A	so if if they come knocking on your door you just detune it and
B	yeah but I mean it's sort of
C	mm
B	you know it's sort of this sort of thing you know this sort of and er there's a list of of sort of they produced online these sort of questionnaires they've got you know what you
A	yeah
B	your name your address or whatever and you think
A	no
B	I'll tell em to go to you know pay money and go to the land registry and get my name
A	yeah yeah
B	you know I am just the occupier
A	yeah
B	and the owner
A	well we often we often get letters to the occupier
B	yeah
C	mm
A	to the owner of the house or
B	mm but the you know they're they're bloody
A	are you a mortgagee?
C	yeah
A	yeah
B	you know Capita
A	yeah
B	who are a private company
A	yeah
B	and the BB and the er the BBC
C	yeah
B	they get through billions ever year
A	yeah
B	don't they?
A	they do
B	I mean they got a licence to print money basically
A	they have yeah
B	all the people who do pay
C	mm
A	mention BBC to
C	why?
A	cos they do not like BBC at all
B	mm
C	I didn't know that
A	and the BBC news is the most biased news there is they reckon
C	oh yeah they do say that mm
A	mm everything about
B	well it isn't unbiased that's one thing's for sure
C	mm
B	I mean there are some pretty biased news programmes
A	there are yeah yeah
B	they got from Sky News in America
A	oh I don't know
B	didn't you see that? on
B	where that bloke's
A	Fox News yeah
B	and said that in Birmingham there's a hundred percent Muslim
A	yes
A	yes that was
C	a hundred percent Muslim
B	yeah
C	mm
A	Birmingham England
A	cos they got a Birmingham in America
C	mm
B	yeah
A	Birmingham England he says
C	yeah
A	is a hundred percent Muslim
C	oh gosh
A	and and he ran on about some
B	there's a
A	yeah and you cannot
C	oh no
A	no-go areas in Birmingham England
C	oh dear
A	the police daren't even go into it
B	mm
C	mm
B	but if it was a hundred percent Muslim the police would be Muslim as well so
A	yeah that's right
C	mm
A	where'd he get that information? I mean
B	I dunno he was supposed to be some some pundit wasn't he?
A	yeah
B	and it when they questioned him about it er oh my resources
C	mm
B	well what resources? oh I'm not I can't at liberty to
A	I
B	you think well if these resources were so poor that they give him that sort of information
A	yeah
B	surely his total credibility has gone out the window
A	out the window yeah
B	cos he's reliant on such poor
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	resources
A	yeah
B	you think well you know but they'll still pay him to come and
A	yeah
B	spout on TV and make up some lies
B	which because it's on TV everyone will start to believe
C	mm
A	well that's like they used to say
C	mm
A	never read in never believe anything you read in the papers
B	mm
A	didn't they? at one time and that's true to a certain extent as well
B	well that's right yeah
A	yeah
B	done for maximum
C	mm
A	yeah
B	er
A	impact
C	mm
B	impact
A	yeah
B	so they're obviously gonna

C	oh
A	yeah so what did they do? put three
C	right
B	instead
A	instead
B	yeah
B	actually it's strange ain't it? that when did they first start putting topless women in The Sun?

B	must be thirty or forty year ago
C	yeah
A	must be yeah
