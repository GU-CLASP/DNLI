A	what should we start talking about?
B	I don't know
A	yeah
B	and then suddenly someone says can you talk?
A	em library fines
B	yeah
A	do you think that they should pay charges on it?
B	God it feels like you're interviewing me
A	it's a bit hefty I mean if you're just not there
B	bit hefty
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	as to  As to  in in advance that you they're gonna get fined
A	that's right
B	no
A	that's the reason why
B	yeah
A	and I had a lady come this morning and she said exactly the same thing
B	yeah
A	so
B	I haven't got anything to say about the library I just sit here and do it
A	I don't know
B	you've learned everything quicker than me
A	you think so?
B	yeah
A	and you've just been doing this job for a few months and now now you know more
A	em
B	no
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	and I can go off like for twenty minutes and just say students come to the
B	yeah we could ask her couldn't we?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	and if if we can't then we'll
A	if if it gets busy then we can just eh
B	yeah
A	speak to our manager and see what she says
B	yeah
A	I can't even imagine it actually she's not in today
B	no she's not
A	no so it will be
A	he'll go oh yeah yeah yeah go ahead
B	oh the library? Oh yeah
A	sorry
B	em I yeah
A	that's right
B	and bringing them back and all that
A	do they have laptops in
B	I don't think so
A	oh
B	it's quite old fashioned
A	oh right
B	if you want to ask somebody something you have to actually go and find them
A	okay
B	so they probably don't get bothered as much so it's the
A	the VD yeah cos they're sort of quite centralised by the
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	well he said that to me he said that oh sat in the middle and
A	yeah that's right em
B	yeah but then I suppose it's good cos we have a lot of international students that probably need a bit more help in terms of finding things and language and all that stuff
A	and a lot of students said well especially the laptop  they are quite popular for the students I think
B	yeah
A	like they like to just sit around different parts of the library
B	yeah
A	and just use the laptop rather than
B	are you serious?
A	go and sit in the computer room
B	at first
A	send it through
B	yeah
A	and it takes quite a while for those computers to load as well
B	mm
A	for the PC to actually load our program yeah
B	oh does it?
A	yeah but when you sign into a laptop it literally takes a few minutes
B	right
A	so they prefer to have that and obviously you can sit
B	yeah
A	so em it gives them that sort of
B	yeah
A	em I would I wouldn't mind actually
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	Cos you think how many people use the laptops here
B	yeah I'd probably sneeze all over it or
A	I know
B	oh
B	oh god they probably don't wash their hands do they when they go to the
A	no they don't
A	oh
B	sorry we're talking about
B	we're a bit off topic here
A	oh I think they need to be cleaned on a daily basis
B	yes
A	but then we would probably have to do that wouldn't we?
B	yeah
A	I don't think I want to
B	oh do you do that?
A	yeah
B	oh sorry
A	yeah
B	oh right
A	other people have been using it especially students
B	yeah
A	and they probably don't clean them
B	see if you'd not have I said it I would never have thought of that
A	but it's the same with PCs as well it I mean you
B	that's true yeah
B	yeah
A	people have been eating things and
B	yeah but yeah
A	so that's why I just I don't really know but
B	yeah
A	em I'd say if you were comparing libraries I cos I used to read here at about five years ago
B	right
A	I graduated in two thousand and six and it's completely different
B	I think someone took your thesis the other day
A	my thesis?
B	possibly
A	no
B	oh
A	which is the same name as me
B	oh is there another
A	yeah
B	yeah cos I saw it and I thought oh has somebody taken Sabina's?
A	yeah
B	oh
A	I saw it on the em trolley and I thought it was mine and then it it was someone else's
B	aw
A	it was a completely different title altogether
B	someone took
A	I know
B	yeah we don't have staplers that's an interesting issue
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	so eh we decided that after as a form of punishment
B	students can't be trusted with staplers
A	with staplers
B	oh are we?
A	but the cost of it is a bit much
B	we should like chain them cos we've got these holes in the desk we should get like a chain and
A	yeah
B	chain them up
A	I mean they are available at the other sites
B	oh are they?
A	if you go to
B	so that's why they always ask then I suppose?
A	but because this library is open twenty-four hours the students tend to just come
B	mm
A	and they either take the stapler
B	mm
A	or they just damage the stapler
B	mm
A	which just means other students can't use it
B	well they take it somewhere else and hide it?
A	that's right
B	mm
A	so I mean it's
B	but they don't do it with hole punchers
A	no
B	responsible with hole punchers
A	yeah
B	no and why would you want to take a hole punch? You wouldn't really would you?
A	no
B	it's too heavy
A	that's true
B	yes because that room was
A	that room is locked
B	not bookable
A	well what happened was that em someone
B	mm
B	so was it cleaned straight away and then they?
A	it was cleaned  It was cleaned
B	yeah
A	but it was just a form of punishment for the
B	oh
A	students wouldn't wouldn't graffiti
B	oh that was quite interesting what you said about that to
unknown_female	sorry can I get the charger bit?
B	sorry
A	yeah
B	as a form of punishment
A	well what happened was that the room was shut and then people who were booked in that room were moved to the the other new rooms
B	right
A	the ones we've got here
B	right
A	I think it's room six
B	right
A	and em there aren't any PCs in that room
B	right
A	so they weren't able to use it and they didn't
B	right
A	eh a few students came on Friday and they were really annoyed because they wanted to use the PC
B	yeah
A	so em what happened was that we had to open the room
B	yeah
A	gave the go-ahead and said they could use the room
A	so
B	but that is a good idea to this idea of like doing something as a consequence of them doing is a good idea but do they
A	they just don't understand why
B	no
A	unless they
B	a bit better don't you?
A	yeah
B	we're doing  We're doing  a recording for the lady
A	the library
B	oh yeah
A	it's alright I've got them
B	that's the room so yeah I was saying I said I thought you needed to communicate these punishments better because otherwise they're not going to work
A	they probably needed to put a notice up I think
unknown_female	I I've just
A	so they might so they should really should really put a notice outside the room?
B	we're laughing cos actually we want to complain about somebody but
A	I might actually
B	yeah get some grumpy customers
A	lecturers and students
B	lecturers yeah
A	we get some
B	yeah
A	em and
unknown_female	bye
A	you you're going to come down again
B	I hate it when they bring their their own computers in and ask you to work out what's wrong
A	I don't mind because I come from an IT background
B	oh right?
A	I don't mind doing things like that
B	oh
A	it gives me an opportunity to use my IT knowledge
B	I obviously haven't got any IT knowledge so
A	so I'm able to help them and they they are quite appreciative so
B	that's good
A	so I like that part
B	so what did you do Masters?
A	em well my Masters in Library
B	right
A	my undergraduate degree was in Business and IT
B	right
A	so when I first
B	oh right
A	em and then it I
B	is that when you were an undergrad or?
A	no
B	mm
A	and em I remember I started working as a liaison assistant
B	mm
A	and I really enjoyed the job so that's when I decided that I could go ahead
B	mm
A	and do the Masters in information and library and information management
B	so what was liaison thing? What's that job?
A	em liaison assistant it was just working for the liaison offices
B	right
A	em and it was a lot of sort of admin things and you know ordering things and
B	right
A	checking on em what books students wanted and dealing with student queries and things
B	right
A	so very very sort of general things
B	right
A	em and then I got moved into acquisitions
B	right
A	em about two years later because you know when project  happened?
B	oh no I don't know
A	you you were you not well?
B	I'm not well I'm just not on the ball really with all this being part time
A	it was quite a few years ago
B	oh no I wasn't here
A	no it was before then
B	yeah
A	see I've been working here for about well it's coming on to five years now
B	right
A	and it doesn't it feels a lot longer actually
B	yeah
B	not just
B	em we were talking about your em your yeah you've been here for five years
A	project headroom that we went through then
B	project headroom
A	so you don't know anything about that?
B	no
A	basically we there was a quite a few
B	oh right
A	em and eh we they had to go for a restructure at the time
B	was this when IT and library became one?
A	no
B	yeah
A	that's when Tony Lewis was here
B	yeah
A	and then we went through a restructure
B	yeah
A	and that was probably one year before I started
B	yeah
A	Cos I remember this em when I started working for the liaison team
B	yeah
A	they were eh they
B	mm hm
A	so a year later em I think they needed some more staff cutbacks
B	right
A	eh and that's when they went for project headroom
B	right
A	so eh and a lot of people took up em voluntary severance pay
B	oh right
A	which is different to what it is now and that's
B	oh right
A	em I get the impression that a lot of people like working for the library that work here anyway
B	yeah
A	cos they're most of them here for that long
B	yeah
A	two years
B	yeah
A	altogether
B	you have done everything haven't you?
A	I know I've worked for liaison and I've worked for em acquisitions but I also worked for em IT training team
B	right
A	the IT training team as well em and then I applied for this job quite a few times
B	yeah well I remember cos
A	no
B	oh right yeah so you're
A	because my brother's her partner
B	your brother's her
A	that's right
B	I thought her  I thought her  brother was your partner
A	yeah
B	so your your brother
A	yeah so
B	your brother is her partner?
A	that's right
B	so that's
A	that's right
B	right I'm getting the family tree in my head now
A	Cos
B	right
A	so it all makes sense now
B	it's all starting to make sense
A	we have  We have  different people working in the library on the enquiry desk don't we?
B	yeah
A	that have been working here for a long time
B	yeah
A	let's hope no one else
B	I was going to say it's going to get busy about eleven isn't it? Cos
A	yeah
B	they change over
A	of students yeah
B	yeah
A	in
B	yeah
A	so what what are what do you find that the resources at
B	I think there are more specific books and resources that I need em
A	yeah
B	so consequently they haven't got exactly the same books but
A	yeah
B	there are
A	yeah you see I I when I did my
B	yeah
A	but it was the help there
B	oh right
A	eh it slightly different because they have an information desk there
B	yeah
A	but it's all just sort of general queries and I know our library is slightly smaller than that library as well
B	mm
A	and they've got libraries on different campuses
B	yeah
A	so I didn't find it as useful
B	right
A	and so when I was doing that I was taking books from here rather than there
B	did you? Yeah cos you were working here at the same time
A	that's right yeah
B	yeah
A	and I just found I've just found it much more convenient
B	mm
A	working here and em I was able to sort of work on my assignments and things like that
B	yeah
A	so and I could obviously cos we've got the facilities here we could use the rooms
B	mm
A	and the computer things and
B	yeah
A	if I needed to if I need the group rooms I could do that here
B	yeah
A	again it was difficult there because they have so many students there
B	yeah
A	but they don't have enough facilities
B	oh
A	em to accommodate
B	mm
A	because other students would've already use be using the room
B	yeah
A	so that's why but em
B	yeah I
A	electronic resources eh that we provide as well
B	but I think they put a lot of money into the library cos I think it's is one of the things that they want
A	it's quite central isn't it to the university so that's probably why but em
B	Cos it's I think it's one of the strengths that they're trying to sort of play on isn't it of of the
A	they are
B	yeah
A	and eh whereas eh you find at
B	mm
A	it's normally during during the summer when it picks up
B	yeah
A	and you get a lot of students trying to do
B	yeah cos they're all on work placements aren't they yeah
A	work placements and things
B	yeah
A	and the students there are not they don't really need much help
B	no
A	but a lot of students here
B	I like it over there though
A	yeah
B	I do like it
A	I do like to work
B	yeah
A	I do like to work at all different sites
B	do you?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	because that way at least you experience all the
B	see
A	yeah
B	she's done some sneaky trick there
A	she has yeah
B	yeah not surprised yeah
A	it is but here you just get a lot of foreign students coming to the desk who are not quite sure what to do
B	yeah
A	but at the same time a lot of students which are business students complain about the littlest things like fines and you know
B	yeah well business yeah
A	you don't really get that  you don't really get that  at that site you don't
B	yeah
A	get very many students complaining
B	do they not argue?
A	no
B	performing Arts is chilled out
A	very
B	business is like
A	and you can see it's true
B	stress
A	it really is
B	yeah
A	and then you get
B	I don't know people are different aren't they? Depending on what they sort of choose to do in life I think yeah
A	choose to do
B	yeah
A	nursing and things
B	yeah
A	and they are more than willing to just come to the desk and just clear their fines with no question
B	yeah
A	you do get the odd student who will ask or have
B	yeah
A	because they on away on placement
B	yeah and they can't get their books in
A	yeah
B	and they're just relieved that they've got five minutes to get in aren't they
A	that's right yeah and they just want to clear whatever fine they have there on their account so
B	all sorted out yeah
A	so like and you get that quite a lot so
B	interviews
B	it's like I've got to talk really naturally even though
A	I know
B	I'm like you've gotta  you've gotta  stand there for two minutes sorry
A	no
B	yeah
A	to talk about the library
B	we've been talking about this library for twenty minutes haven't we?
B	and then sometimes
A	yeah
A	em
B	right
A	we won't find anything to say yeah
B	yes
A	the ones that em cos they look like cash machines
B	yeah
A	em a lot of students thought they were cash machines
B	I wish they were I wish we had cash machines
A	they got quite yeah
B	yeah
A	which and it's got a return at the top
B	I don't like being left to our own in resources
A	do you not?
B	oh she's disappeared
A	I know
B	Cos then I feel like oh I haven't actually got anything to say about the library at all
A	I have yeah
B	oh get you
A	oh
B	is it not?
A	no
A	it's more to do with the em searching and creating sort of search engines
B	yeah
A	and like that em
B	oh right so is it actually like
A	we we've done some
B	right
A	it's was sort of variety of things
B	but nothing that you would use every day or?
A	I can't really yeah I can't really think of anything I mean what I did my dissertation on the em library reading list system LaSU
B	right
A	which I thought was quite useful at the time
B	yeah
A	but I'm not sure how how much students use it though
B	I don't know
A	and whether they find it useful
B	mm
A	coming to my desk asking about it
B	we did for a while actually there was quite quite a lot for a while
A	but then it's yeah it's quite
B	yeah
A	and it is working in acquisitions it is em they do it a lot actually with LaSU
B	do they?
A	yeah say em you know ordering books and things it's all based on reading list system
B	but the thing is even if we even if they don't access the reading list through the library site they they're still getting books on the reading list and they've got the reading list on paper haven't they? So we might not know that it's
A	on the reading list but that's why they go
B	yeah
A	Cos all the formulas and everything that we em order books are are based on the reading lists
B	right
A	em and the lecturers whereas in the past it used to be where the lecturer would give the student numbers
B	yeah
A	I say we but acquisitions have to work out the formula
B	what does that mean then?
A	it's the formula that's given according to the number of students
B	oh I see
A	that are on the course
B	right
A	so and that's how they order the books
B	so that's quite good
A	yes
B	and this one guy and he hasn't put  he hasn't put  his em reading on the VLE so they can't get it
A	right
B	a hundred and twenty
A	yeah
B	one book
A	yeah
B	so I'm like going I can't take this book out
A	no
B	Cos all these students want to take it
A	no
B	yeah I've got to reserve it but it just seems mean doesn't it?
A	well you get that you get but the
B	yeah
A	and there's a maximum I think twenty is the maximum of books that you can order
B	right
A	and I remember a few students coming to my desk complaining saying that there weren't enough cos the students were borrowing the books but actually the the books that are available in the library are only supposed to be for reference
B	right
A	if they've got core texts they need to purchase the core texts
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	and that's why
B	not if you've gotta use it throughout
A	no
B	mm
A	says core text the students really are expected to purchase them
B	yeah
A	especially when they're making reservations
B	mm
A	some of the books
B	mm
A	and you know they'll come back and say why? I want to use it for longer and you think well
B	yeah like when they go oh I've I've read it I've not had a chance to read it
A	yeah
B	and it's like really important
A	no
B	you're like well that's why everyone needs it isn't it?
A	that's right yeah why it's better to purchase it
