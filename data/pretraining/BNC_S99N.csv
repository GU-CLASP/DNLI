B	I think we went to Tintern Abbey
A	we've been to Tintern Abbey
B	yeah
A	didn't you go to Tintern with us? No
C	huh?
B	I think we did
C	no
A	where's that place you went with us? Oh no that was some farm
D	that was Cardiff Bay
B	I couldn't say
C	that was in
A	that was a farm place
B	yes
A	Cos we had pictures of when
D	oh yes where was that?
A	I don't know
D	Cos we walked up
A	that was something else
D	we walked up them lovely gardens didn't we
A	and there was funny little houses everywhere
D	yeah
C	huh? Oh
B	I was thinking of that one the other day
D	yeah that was the medieval place
A	mm
C	yeah
A	just outside of Cardiff anyway wasn't it
D	yeah
B	mm
A	yeah
D	yeah it was yeah
B	mm
D	with all them thatched round houses
A	mm
B	mm
C	mm
A	we go to castles everywhere we go don't we?
B	yeah oh
A	we look for castles or
C	well you can't miss them in Wales
D	yeah
A	is there?
B	oh right
C	mm
D	well that was only cos the English built the castles to to defeat the Welsh
B	we went to
C	hmm
B	oh sorry I don't
D	and then in the end what happened I I don't know what king it was but he said we'll make him
C	mm
D	and we'll and I'll give you and you can have a prince
C	hmm mm mm
D	and
A	huh?
D	that's yeah
A	I don't get it
D	well the King of England at the time
A	mm mm
D	and he said I'll give you a prince
A	right
C	hmm
B	mm
D	and they accepted him as the Prince of Wales and now he we we still got the Prince of Wales going on and on and on and on
A	in the Royal family
D	in the Royal family
B	they made the baby for
A	cheeky
D	yeah and that that's how  that's how  the Prince of Wales came about
B	mm
A	mm
C	hmm
D	clever you know these medieval people
B	mm
C	hmm mm
B	yeah
A	why did Wales accept a prince from us?
D	well they're a bit
A	why didn't they say well we can find our own prince
B	I don't know
D	well that's a bit
C	well they probably had a a sword to their throat
B	mm
D	mm probably
C	I remember the Welsh were really
D	yeah they were
C	they were really good archers
D	yeah
C	and that's where the like sticking two fingers up that's where that one comes from
D	that's right yeah
A	I
C	because they defeated the English like using their bow and arrow
D	yeah
C	and then which leaves the two fingers doesn't it
A	is that true?
D	they used to cut the two fingers off didn't they the Welsh
C	mm
D	they used to cut the fingers off
C	hmm
D	so that they couldn't fight again
A	so that they couldn't use a bow and arrow?
D	and when the Welsh won they said we've still got our two fingers
C	mm
D	and that's how the two finger thing come on
A	what the English cut off the Welsh fingers?
D	they used to that's what they used to do
A	so that they couldn't use their bow and arrow?
D	yeah
A	ah
C	hmm
A	how did it ever change to one finger?
D	that's a modern one that is
C	happy Days?
D	yeah
A	oh
D	and then that that became sit on it
C	hmm
A	sit oh really?
D	mm
A	I never knew that
D	well I don't know I I couldn't say that that was true but
A	in Italy
D	that's what they used to
A	I think it's Italy isn't it? That
C	I don't know what you're talking about
C	how am I supposed to know what you're talking about?
A	well that it's rude to have the your fingers like the victory
C	oh lots of countries it they've all got their er little things haven't they
D	yeah yeah
A	mm
C	like in Turkey you can't go like that
A	like this for us is peace or victory
D	oh you can't go like that in Turkey?
C	can't do the okay symbol
D	no?
C	Cos that means well a part of your body
D	oh right does it yeah
A	it's weird
C	you'd probably get punched in the face if you do that
A	I like learning all those body language things
C	yeah
D	yeah that is weird because all these countries have got different and yet you're supposed to know them all
A	yeah
D	milking a cow
