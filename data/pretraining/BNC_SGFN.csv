A	lull in
B	that's fine yeah
A	and
B	yes well
A	er
B	the funny thing is with when
A	oh god yeah
B	and we get all the best stuff you know
A	well
B	he doesn't look
A	they don't don't think
B	well he does
A	and also you get all the rubbish stuff from the erm deli counter when
B	oh yeah
A	gonna be the bit of ham that's on the end that
A	I always refuse to have
A	cos it's dried out
A	and it's the bit they want to get rid of
A	oh
B	honestly I don't mind value stuff but it's literally unedible isn't it? inedible isn't it
C	yeah
A	well
B	it's disgusting
A	we do buy the Collier's Welsh cheese which is more expensive but
B	I buy whatever's on offer you know from the whole range of cheese there's always one that's a good one that's on offer and that's one and I buy
A	but you've really got to keep your eye on it because the
B	mm
A	cat like the cat food the big bags of cat food they're normally fourteen pound forty-nine
B	wow that's a lot
A	but occasionally it er a particular supermarket will put them down to ten pound
B	mm
A	and unfortunately I had to buy one for fourteen forty-nine just before we went away on holiday but
A	yesterday I noticed they were ten pound
B	yeah
A	so I bought one
A	but it's just
B	have bought two or three
A	well I should have done really erm
B	might go off though
A	I know but
B	and the cat might not like it
A	but then and you've got to carry it all back here for him
B	mm
A	erm
B	but some people they they go on their apps and things and find out which products
A	well
B	are going cheap and then go round all the different
A	I know but
B	er universities? different
C	yeah
B	big
A	and that the other type of cat food Waitrose sell it the cheapest or they did do
B	Co-op
B	have you seen the Co-op special offers? we
C	and Ben and Jerry's ice cream
B	Ben and Jerry's ice cream a big one erm a baguette all of it the whole lot for five pound
A	oh amazing
B	it's ridiculous
C	and then we went into Co-operative just up the road and the Ben and Jerry's alone was four ninety-nine
A	yeah yeah I don't think our Co-op does offers like that I've never seen it
B	it probably doesn't need to
A	no I don't
B	ours is in a place where there's you know
A	is that too done for you?
C	mm
A	do you want me to scrape a bit off?
B	oh
A	well it's easy to do
B	yeah
C	thank you
B	erm
B	yeah so
A	I know it is I but you you I can't spend my life doing it so I just I mean er things that are really expensive like cat food I do and I'll buy them on the internet if
B	yeah
A	and get them delivered to
B	I mean we've got
B	you know because
B	Morrisons and the prices have gone down actually in Morrisons but if you do go to Lidl and stuff it is a lot cheaper
A	oh yeah
B	on the other hand I don't particularly like the meat
A	but you can't do all your shopping
B	or the fruit the fruit's not as good as Morrisons not nearly so
A	oh
C	and the meat's not very nice
B	the meat's not very nice either
A	oh no
B	so we don't buy it so we're not
A	no
B	we end up with a loads of stuff without the meat and then you actually haven't got anything to cook so
A	mm the trouble is you just can't well you could spend your whole life doing it and then to be really pleased with yourself
B	oh
A	that's not life is it?
B	no hardly
A	mm
B	it's a complete waste of time
A	I mean we can do all our shopping from here with the Co-op the butcher's the baker's
B	mm
A	well I make bread anyway but
B	yeah well you could do actually but the meat's not particularly good at the Co-op is it? do you think?
A	oh no because we've got a butcher's
B	oh you've got the butcher's yeah
A	yeah so no
B	well in that case you could but it's
A	erm you say that but
B	some of it's alright
A	they have some nice steaks
B	the sausages are
A	and erm you need to be careful what you buy cos they
B	they don't have free range do they?
A	adulterate a lot of it you know they put like some sauce
A	already which I don't like but the some of their steak's really good actually
B	really?
A	I quite often buy a small steak and chop it up
B	yeah
A	then just fry it quickly and then put it on a salad or
B	they probably
A	erm
B	have different stuff than than they do
A	they have free range chicken and
B	oh do they?
A	yeah
B	oh they don't in the
A	ah well I think we I think ours is much better
B	yeah
A	you know
B	ours is not very good for meat and also
C	and it's just a smaller shop
B	it's much more expensive it's more expensive as well you know
A	and salmon
B	the wine's quite good
A	the stuff like milk's much more expensive because
B	yeah
A	it's handy for
B	washing up liquid's much more
C	can I get some orange juice? is there any?
A	you can take some orange juice yeah I

B	I don't know
A	and do anything in life?
B	I I don't know I really don't know
A	I mean he's not alone at all
B	no no and I and I have tried you know the more you try the more he resists it so I've just tend to leave him now but I do every morning get him you know try and get him going but it's just impossible
C	no it's cos he goes out really late and then
B	he goes out late and he's not into a rhythm of staying up
A	he's not
B	at the moment he's not
A	oh I'm not surprised
B	you know
A	I'm still confused about what to do in life
B	I know
A	but seriously though I mean you know
B	yeah no I know
A	some days I think shall I go out and get a job? or shall I not? or
B	mm
A	and what do I want to do? what what what do I want to be in life? you know
B	yeah and we're coming up for
A	I think erm
B	sixty
B	thinking it
A	well I think if you like
B	it all goes
A	want to be a doctor or a dentist there's you've got something specific to aim for but
B	no we weren't
A	no no I just don't think we ever wanted to to be
B	it never entered my head that I could be a doctor or a
A	no
B	it just didn't enter my head
A	no
B	remember ever having conversations about what do you want to be apart from at primary school when you said you wanted to be an air hostess or
A	oh yeah well
B	whatever you know I don't remember
A	no I don't think we we at
B	no
A	at all
B	no
A	and er and just in
B	just
A	you know like they like
B	aim high and
A	to print in the paper ninety-seven percent of our girls have gone to university
B	yeah
A	and didn't want to be one of those I wanted to ruin their statistics
B	but you still did it so you still went
A	no but
B	oh that's right
A	mm
B	yeah
A	mm and careers woman was she was this huge woman
B	pass me the crust
A	I remember her
B	I'll eat the crust
C	do you want
A	with
B	oh
A	a huge
A	no experience of life at all
A	she'd just worked in a girls' school all her life
B	yeah
A	mm she was the one advising people about what to do and
B	mm
A	you just thought hang on a minute
B	well I don't think they're much better now because otherwise they would
A	and she had her favourites you know
B	mm
A	and erm she'd known them since they were
A	well cos it's you
B	all of
A	cos you're his mother
B	I know do you think that's what it is?
A	yeah totally
B	in that case
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	yeah but you don't feel like that do you?
A	between mothers and daughters normally than mothers and sons
B	but it's for us it doesn't seem to be does it
A	because it's not come to the crunch point yet
B	what what crunch point?
A	but also yeah
A	well I mean
B	I don't know I mean
A	it is for really difficult yeah I mean
B	it is really difficult yeah because it's not
A	but parents are not the best people to
B	no
A	to help
B	but the trouble is
A	at all
B	you know university now for for
A	but therefore he needs to do an apprenticeship or something but they
B	well that's what he that's what he's gonna try and do
A	do you know we had some brilliant people to do some jobs around the house that needed doing
B	mm
A	erm and he was saying about the government are just cutting back on all the apprenticeship opportunities
B	they're meant to being
A	they said they'd love to have an
B	I thought they were doing the opposite I thought they were increasing
A	mm
B	the numbers
A	well well they're making
B	they're gonna they're aiming for three million
A	I mean and we had to have an electrician recently to do something and he's he was saying exactly the same is that erm it's there's just disincentives to do it
B	erm
A	I know they're saying that they're doing it but they're not
B	no
A	actually doing it
B	to have someone?
A	yeah
B	yeah and the government don't want to put any money into it cos they don't want to put any money into anything do they?
A	well exactly and I think I think also it it you know it if you say you've got to go to university to study to be an electrician or a plumber it kind of devalues it in a way
B	mm
A	because
B	yeah but that's not the sort of apprenticeship
B	he wants to get into marketing and business erm business management and marketing
A	he needs to erm
B	go to university
A	he needs to do an MBA or something
B	and he can't do that until he's done a degree so
A	no
B	erm
A	well he could get try and get taken on by an employer doing something and then they could
B	yeah and then they
A	a lot of employers do
A	pay for you to do a degree and that sort of thing
B	yeah
A	I mean it was just a bit unlucky that they
B	cos they would
A	didn't pay for her to do her MA
B	they might have done in this job
A	mm
B	but then she wouldn't have got the job if she hadn't been
A	well I I know so
B	mm it's lovely this bread isn't it?
C	yeah really it's delicious
A	do you want some more?
B	erm
C	I'm fine thank you
B	no thanks
A	mm I don't know
B	we could slice a piece off for
A	he won't be able to cut it himself?
B	I don't well not evenly and if you don't want it hacked up I think he'll probably find it difficult cos we
A	doesn't really matter I'll I will cut some more bits
B	mm
C	yeah
B	have we? stop it then
