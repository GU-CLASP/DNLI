A	er information sheet and you have to sign off a
B	oh
A	which is only right they should have that record for them
B	yeah so so other than this mixture of ecclesiastical and erm
B	naked profit-making amongst property developers er what other kind of weekend did you have?
B	uhu
A	I was looking forward to seeing a bit of football on the telly cos we're
B	yes
A	it's the last gasp of things and so on but I missed
B	mm
A	the Barcelona Atletico match
B	oh I I saw Gerard's farewell
A	ah what was that like?
B	terribly disappointing
B	you know
A	yes right
B	B to score the winning goal
A	right exactly
B	and it only turned terribly tearjerking and romantic at the end when he was out with his three daughters
A	I was about to say
B	on the pitch
A	was the family brought onto the pitch? I that's
B	his wife stayed in the stands
A	oh very sensible
A	very sensible that's right
B	young daughter and his two older ones were were with him all dressed
A	if
B	in identical outfits
A	er it's it's become a bit of a
B	some of the other Liverpool players had their youngsters
A	yeah well
B	with them as well yes you're right it is a bit of a tradition that er that snooker player started it I think donkey's years ago when he won the world championship Higgins suddenly a tearful Higgins
A	yes
B	was
A	brought on with a
B	his his child was thrust into his arms you know
B	and that kind of thing and and this was in the Crucible
B	bank holiday Monday
A	that's
B	midnight or something like that
B	you know smoke and beery things and
A	that's right in those days when you could smoke in the stadium
A	good heavens above
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	mm
A	is he was he the er the more er er devil er you know what do they what do we call it? the kind of er buccaneering bloke er
B	yeah he was a heavy drinker
A	a heavy drinker that's right yes
B	yeah he's he died of it didn't he? yeah
A	oh he died of it?
B	I think so yeah I think he's dead now
A	I'm thinking of some Hurricane Higgins I'm thinking about
B	yes that's the guy yeah and it's it's the same one I think
A	I thought it was
B	mm
A	whose got that sort of reputation of being a daredevil or a?
A	no no that's alright
B	all I remember is for those of you watching in black and white
A	right
B	the pink's behind the green or whatever or it was you know and
A	that yes isn't it that's right exactly that's right it used to be very popular on TV didn't it? it was BBC two's
B	you had Pot Black as well didn't you?
B	yeah colour television made it
A	that's it that's it
B	you know
A	that's right that's right
B	erm but er
A	mind you it was the days when there were only three or four channels to watch so
B	indeed
A	it wouldn't have been that difficult to generate a very large audience
B	no but anyway I didn't see that erm I did some gardening
A	good
B	well nothing good about it it was a case of go out there now or get lost in the jungle and
A	that's right
B	and having to send out a search party
B	to find me
A	I think Saturday was
B	erm
A	good enough for that but Sunday wouldn't have been I don't think would it?
B	er I was lucky erm
A	okay
B	I the grass was dry enough on Sunday and I I went out and er and did it and the rest of the time I was marking dissertations and
A	ah yes you
B	in Chinese
A	you've taken a whole bunch for
B	mm
A	of
B	yes
A	what were they like in the end?
B	oh it's the language difficulties with the
A	sure
B	Chinese students I mean
A	sure sure sure sure
B	speaking to one or two of them it becomes clearer after a bit what they're at
A	yes
B	but obviously they need to make their written English clearer too so
A	sure
B	I think there will be a bit of a challenge there but I think we'll be alright
A	I've always
B	the dissertations
A	been struck
B	one was poor one was good
A	but just in the ordinary sort of the way that of er of poorness and goodness? like
B	yeah
A	everybody else
B	I mean
A	can be poor and good? yeah
B	yeah erm
A	fine
B	you know one was a third and one was a a
B	yes well I had two things here I had proposals from three four MSC students
A	right
B	it was postgraduates and I
A	yes
B	also had two undergraduate dissertations which were late handed in
A	okay right
B	and the deadlines and the deadlines for the dissertations as such and the proposals that with the students here on and it really had to be done on the weekend so
A	well they're going to be sent off for the external any time soon aren't they? very very imminently I think
B	yes and
A	not that they must well we've had this discussion before not that they can do much about it
B	no no I mean I I I think the
B	or under-marking or
A	mm
B	to do more empirical work rather than be play safe with the with their graphical?
A	it's not I've seen I've seen in
B	and in fact that's what we've done now
A	it's interesting
B	we we've not we've not put it in
A	yes yes right
B	but we really
A	you allow
B	have encouraged and I would say perhaps say to you ninety percent of all of our undergraduates now do
A	interesting
B	some form of empirical work
A	interesting
B	and it's actually made much more interesting for me
A	I'd have thought so
B	erm
A	I think really the empirical piece is bound to be at least a bit original
B	yeah
A	whereas a rehashing er well rehashing a long essay's just a long essay basically
B	one of our students did something I thought was really rather clever it and I'm not even sure I'm using this correctly it might have been even phenomenological
A	wow
B	because she did a study of her fellow students on the third year of the criminology course
A	yes
B	to see whether the
A	but did she do it before and after?
B	er I think she compared it with people who were non criminology students
B	because you know
A	ah mm
B	yeah I know what you mean but we it it's not perfect
B	empiricism but
A	you're right
B	you know
A	all that
B	you know
A	all that
B	yeah
A	think differently or say differently from
B	yeah okay
A	non criminology students whether they'd change when they were
B	there may be there may be more to it than that
A	alright okay yeah
B	because I I wasn't supervising
A	yeah yeah alright
B	this at all
A	okay that's alright
B	but erm but I yeah I thought that was er quite
A	good for her
B	a more interesting use of students
A	yes yes yes
B	rather than the the stuff on drugs
A	yeah
B	or drink or er
A	which there's more normal
B	mm
A	but do they get any research methods training from you?
B	er yeah they do it I think jointly with the sociology people
A	okay right okay
B	I think it's now jointly one
A	so not thrown into the deep end?
B	no no no
B	no and and to be fair
A	okay
B	it's it's I wouldn't say it's advanced it it tends to be things like online questionnaires
A	right
B	or semi-structured interviews or maybe a focus group
A	fine
B	and a limited number of people
A	sure
B	you know it it would be churlish of us to say well we're it's brilliant but we're not gonna give you any marks because it's it there's there's the sample's too small you know
A	I mean with a with an online questionnaire you can reasonably easily knock up a hundred people
B	yes but it's it's difficult for instance if you wanted to interview some police officers just
A	oh no no
B	just to get
A	if you're doing
B	seven or eight
A	no no no
B	is doing brilliantly
A	that's fantastic
B	you know yeah
A	no that's a difficult kettle of fish
B	yeah yeah
A	but
B	no you're right with online stuff
A	people's perceptions of
B	yeah
A	drugs er
B	yeah
A	drugs drink whatever
B	yeah
A	that yeah that's comparatively
B	yeah
A	straightforward
B	yeah
A	it's what they do with it afterwards they're after whether they can
B	yeah indeed
A	write about it in an insightful
B	yeah
A	way and relate it to the
B	yeah
A	literature and to make theoretical
B	exactly
A	you know
B	exactly and some of them
B	do that really well and others you know they struggle with it
A	sure
B	but erm but it it's made for a more interesting crop
A	good
B	I think of
A	good
B	topics and
A	good good
B	erm er and to an extent I think it's the allowed them to put into practice skills that would
A	and it's another line for their CV in that regard
B	yeah
A	you know they're going to go to places which are gonna expect the student to be able to do a
B	yes
A	you know
B	yeah yeah
A	be it be the performance of the shop in the last six months or
B	mm
A	you know undertake to do a survey of their customers or
B	and and for the first time they really understand firsthand you know what data is how you've got to organise it
A	true
B	and make sense of it and
A	true
B	never mind
A	true
B	the gathering of it
A	that's right
B	you know erm
A	the kind of
B	so it's very good for them
A	unless they are going to be reading frontline research papers they may never come across data
B	mm
A	in its comparatively not raw but you know
B	yeah
A	doing in somebody doing something with it as opposed to textbooks and simply
B	mm I think that's
A	and digesting it
B	I think that's right I mean er I can think of a couple of professions that some of our students have gone into say policing probation prison service
A	mm
B	do that would
A	mm
B	require detailed erm quantitative or qualitative methods
A	no but they're gonna be in an information environment where things will come at them
B	yeah
A	and they have to understand
B	and oh I agree with all that I
A	no that's true
B	to handle
A	that's true
B	quantitative
A	that's true
B	and qualitative data
A	that's true
B	because the police don't
A	that's true
B	the
A	exactly so that's right
B	or they've got civilian employees
A	that's right
B	to do
A	that's true
B	that kind of thing or they want academics to do the research and give them er the findings you know?
A	like your good self
B	like my good self but you've got to sign the Official Secrets Act
B	in case we don't like the outcome
B	I I'm afraid I couldn't say
A	I
B	I'm afraid
B	it's more than my life's worth
A	yes I I mean some of those
B	just if if you
A	er er
B	just by asking me
B	you know?
A	I have compromised my integrity
A	yes
B	of guilt by association
A	iation that's right
B	I
B	of the official secrets act
B	people well who says there are sections?
A	oh yeah
A	I wonder how many of our students go into and not just from your course but from all out courses go into the police one of my students wants to already
B	yeah
A	she's told me
B	yeah well
A	she's in her second year and she wants to she's already
B	yeah well recruitment is picking up slightly erm even though they're still losing frontline officers but
A	what what does the graduate go in as? a beat officer like a bobby on the beat?
B	you'll you'll have to at the moment still for the time being you have to join as a PC
A	but isn't there some acceleration?
B	but at the moment even under the sort of erm elite system of
A	yeah
A	but you are expected to do it for less time?
B	you are expected to get to inspector after four five years or something like that
A	is that the next step up?
B	no sergeant's the next
A	oh sergeant
B	step up
A	mm there's the
B	you've got to pass the exams
A	sure
B	and pass the interviews
A	sure
B	but the idea is that they've er they've identified a
A	sure
B	you know your your rising star
A	yes
B	there is a it probably under the Tories it might resurface but there was a little while ago a suggestion that in order to change the culture of the police
A	mm
B	and to give them skills that possibly they don't have in sufficient number at the moment
A	oh
B	army at the age of
A	yes
B	say forty
A	right yes yes
B	er
A	yes
B	he or she make a
A	yes
B	wonderful
A	yes
B	superintendent?
A	yes
B	erm and someone who's been in charge of a medium-sized company
A	yes
B	wouldn't they make et cetera et cetera you know
A	of course the gut answer is no but presumably
A	mm
B	suggestion
A	mm
B	and I don't see this coming about but it's been
A	mm
B	floated within the Metropolitan Police Authority
A	yes
B	let them skip the rank of
A	mm
B	that would be seen as positive discrimination
A	yeah
B	just
A	yes yes yes yes
B	in the way that the other one isn't
A	isn't yes that's interesting
B	you know erm and and I think that would be even less popular
A	mm
B	amongst the er existing police personnel
B	there we are
A	it's it's such a well embedded culture
B	it is yeah
A	that you rise through the ranks
B	every chief constable in the land at the moment
A	has always been
B	has been a PC
A	mm is that true and er I think it must be true of the armed services? that you can't join as a cook or major er well
B	no that that's not true
A	of course it's the officer class
B	you you can
A	yes that's
B	go in as an officer
A	okay that's
B	never having been a private
A	true
B	a sergeant
A	that's true
B	or anything
A	that's true
B	like that yeah
A	that's true that's true
B	there is a
A	and in fact it's very unlikely that if you're a private you rise to the officer class
B	I think that is unusual yes it's not unheard of but it's unusual
A	so if that can happen
B	well it it's happened it's happened in in the navy and the army for a long time we I mean at one time if you remember in the navy people used to buy their commissions
A	that's right that's right
B	I I don't know whether they ever did in the army but erm
B	I I don't know the answer to that erm
A	whereas in the police
B	it was always argued
A	those skills
B	that you had to have that on-the-ground experience to get a nose for what was
A	yes
B	going on
A	exactly so that's right
B	er that it I mean
A	right sure
B	experiential
A	sure
B	common sense kinds of approaches to to issues
A	knowledge of the
B	yes yeah that kind of thing
A	that's right
B	yeah
A	whereas the private in the
B	yeah
A	a very large
B	yeah
A	degree they're not being sent out in teams let alone individually
B	yes
A	it's it
B	yeah that's probably be
A	unless it's a trade er
B	yeah
A	unless it's
B	I think that's true and the other thing is that although the police are also er er er a sort of a ranked organisation
A	mm mm
B	and they've set great store by it erm what's different is that a PC always exercises discretion
A	right
B	you can't
A	right right
B	order a PC to do something
A	sure sure
A	well sure
B	the element of discretion
A	whereas of course in the army that's completely out of
B	in the army
A	the picture
B	you always take orders from your whether it's from your colonel or whether it's
A	yes yes
B	from your sergeant
A	that's right
B	there is very little area for discretion
A	that's right
B	and people in battle who show discretion either get killed or they win the VC you know
A	mm yeah well that's right that's right
B	it's that kind of thing isn't it you know? erm
A	yes and the entry qualifications I would have
B	they yes I mean
A	that must be the case
B	go into the army with virtually no
A	with no qualifications
B	qualifications
A	whereas
A	if it's comparable then that's different from the army I would have
B	it is different you I you don't I think the army you know you really need erm good character and that kind of thing but erm even that's
A	mm
B	I mean
A	mm
B	you could
A	mm
B	have committed
A	mm mm
B	and they'll still have you in the army
A	what about tattoos? er the army takes people with tattoos
B	yes
A	but
B	it does yeah
A	what about
B	and so does so does the
A	police officers?
B	yes but
A	fuck the police on your
B	yes that kind of thing it wouldn't
A	oh that was a a mere bagatelle when I was a youngster
A	I didn't know quite I was doing
B	so you're telling me you won't forgive me for
B	a youthful indiscretion?
A	yeah come on
A	and in the pub
A	okay
B	I have a student to see thank you very much
A	cheers
B	for the coffee
A	alright my pleasure as ever
B	I liked seeing you
A	yep see you later
B	I'll catch up with you soon
A	yeah cheers
B	cheers mate bye bye
