A	erm
B	so what were you
A	I'm at a part where I have to destroy a dinosaur made out of well it's a gigantic metal T-Rex that has laser beams rocket launchers grenade launchers mini guns fire coming out of its like exhausts and it breathes fire at the same time
B	mm sounds a bit mad
A	and it's and it's about twenty times the size of me cos my character's just like a little girl but she can she's like a mechanic so her special ability is she summons something called death trap and then that's just like a robot that helps me every now and again and so it's it's the big dinosaur robot's a lot bigger than me and it's very hard to beat
B	yeah and what's the actual ultimate object of the game?
A	to beat Handsome Jack
B	and have you met him yet?
A	kind of
B	who is Handsome Jack?
A	Handsome Jack is er well there's a planet and erm there's a vault on this planet that has been discovered and it holds a very valuable alien resource called eridium and everyone in space wants eridium and this planet called Pandora has a gigantic just storage of storage of erm eridium so this big
B	eridium?
A	so this big evil
B	what's eridium?
A	er it's just like
B	is that a natural element? or is that made up?
B	it's not in real life?
A	no
B	oh that's a shame they should er use something from real life mm
A	well it's kind of a made up universe
B	okay
A	they could've said diamond but that wouldn't be as cool
B	mm okay
A	cos eridium like is like this glowing substance that has so much energy and so much power
B	yeah
A	so he's trying to get to this vault no one really knows where it is but he's just digging towards it and he's just this big gigantic company that are like big bad space company
B	mm
A	and he's the big master of it
B	yeah
A	and erm there are like other bandits and people who try to get to this vault and they're quite skilled
B	yeah
A	and they wanna get to this vault before Handsome Jack
B	yeah
A	and they wanna get all the riches for themselves and so they can be rich and stuff
B	yeah
A	and they're called vault hunters
B	vault hunters?
A	vault hunters yeah
B	vault hunters
A	vault hunters
A	and you you are a vault hunter
B	mm
A	okay? so Handsome Jack tries to kill you because obviously you're his contester you're the one you're the one
B	oh I see
A	that's kind of like stopping him from getting to the vault cos you're gonna get to it first so the whole company's after you
B	okay oh I see
A	so that's the aim of the game you have to kill Handsome Jack get to the vault open the vault become super rich I dunno I haven't there might be a super plot twist I haven't I haven't got to the end yet but there's a DLC where there's the
B	no
A	downloadable content which means after the game's out
B	mm
A	after the game is out there's already there's
B	what's that
A	so I'm playing through that now and it's called the Badass Crator of Badassitude and there's the the owner of the guy is called Mr Torgue he's like
B	er so it's like er
A	yeah
B	add-
A	that that weren't
B	the original
A	but erm
B	is that kind of super cool?
A	I don't understand
B	well is it cool to have downloaded downloadable content? or are you just really embarrassed by me cos I'm such a dinosaur?
A	what?
B	oh oh I see
A	I don't understand
B	mm
A	it's not cool to get downloadable content
B	mm
A	it's if you want the downloadable content and you think you'll have fun playing it
B	okay I see
B	you educated me
A	does it? doesn't it look like there's a border on that TV? grey line
B	what do you mean?
A	it's like a little grey white line going around the TV
B	there is a border to the TV
A	yeah
B	that's why it has one yeah there is one there
A	no but the little grey like plaster
B	I don't know I'm a bit short-sighted I wouldn't really
A	can you see it? it's right there
B	that's just how it came
A	I don't remember seeing that before ever
B	these are all new aren't they? do you remember when we first moved in? the TVs weren't here there was a different one
A	you didn't have a TV?
B	no there was one big one but er
A	mm
B	cos
A	we used to have a TV over there and that was the computer over there well first off
A	first off the baby room was an office room with a computer that's where the computer was originally
B	I hated that room
A	hated it? I thought it was amazing
A	and then
B	it was just like a teenage room
A	instead of a monitor we just had a big TV and then we had like a keyboard and a mouse and that's how we played our computer games
B	it was just one big computer thing
A	and
B	yeah it's cos I refuse to have them elsewhere
A	it felt so much more multiplayer
B	yeah it was
A	but
B	but then you can play games on like Xbox here with a big sofa cos you didn't have that before did you?
A	pretty sure I did
B	where did you play? where would you play Xbox before?
A	pretty sure it was here
B	but nothing really to sit on was there? or was there?
A	pretty
B	there was those two green ones
A	you got rid of the best sofa in the whole living room the black leather sofa
B	was there a black leather one?
A	yeah it was the best mm
B	I didn't get rid of it
A	no idea why he did it then it it was it was because it always felt cold
B	probably cos it was horrible
A	it's not like you just go on go on it and it's just you know it's soft but so was the black leather sofa and it was just always cold and it's like you know when you flip over the? you know you flip your pillow?
B	yeah
A	to get the cold side
B	well I don't do that actually
A	are you serious?
B	yeah I don't flip my pillow
A	really?
B	I don't need cold things
A	well anyway when you flip your pillow it's just like a new pillow every time you go on it it's just cold and nice
A	are you serious? you've never flipped your pillow?
B	erm
A	that's like all I do and do you ever put your hand under the pillow? so what what I do is when when my face gets too hot and it's just all the pillow's just too hot I just flip it round and that side's colder because it it or fresher cos er my face hasn't been on it then my face is back on it and then I put my hand underneath so I'm like that and it's like cold
B	do you put your hand underneath your pillow then?
A	course
B	so do I
A	not
A	I don't
B	yeah I think you are I think you're made a bit warmer than other people
A	because I I sweat way more than other people way more
B	yeah
A	erm I'm way more cold resistant like I can bear so much more cold than other people that's very true mum
B	yeah
A	like I can I can just be outside in at like nine o'clock on winter with not that many stuff and I'd like it it's just kind of cool
B	yeah
A	but a lot of people would be like you'd only see their face they'd be covered in all that stuff
B	yeah
A	and I just find that too hot so I'm always just like
B	just one leg out
A	one or two legs out just
B	why one or two? is it like one leg?
A	because like
B	I'll just do the right leg today just because my right leg feels like it?
A	no it's because I always sleep on my side always
B	oh you mean out of your bed?
A	yeah I always sleep
B	I was thinking like walking round town
A	oh no no
A	like I always sleep on my side and it's a bit weird to always do that
A	so it's not it's better just like that
A	cos
B	and it's
A	and I also have my other arm out and then my other arm under the pillow
B	but then you had been
A	that's just because that's just because oh my goodness it's so warm down here and then when you're warm
B	catastrophic?
A	for like oh my goodness you've never
B	oh my goodness?
A	I don't think you've ever done this where you've been in your your room or something we're in where it's just like so warm and all that and then you just go into my room and you just get pneumonia
A	it's like when I'm in my room all the time it's fine
B	is it like a fridge? you open the door and it's like
B	you can you hear the Antarctic
A	it's fine when I get used to it cos then it's just it's just my room then when I go out I'm like oh it's pretty warm in here
B	you should you should just hang a coat and gloves and everything and a hat outside
A	you always get angry at me for wearing my black hoody
B	I don't get
A	well yeah not angry you're just like
B	yeah but you put them on with nothing
A	what's wrong with that? what's wrong?
B	because it's
A	so that that part you just wanna see just that much of a T-shirt you just wanna see
B	it's more like I don't think you should be wearing like sweats or erm or knitted things just over bare skin I think it's I think it makes them a bit smelly
A	I think it makes me even warmer and it feels nice
B	strong
A	got crazy terminology
B	yeah they're not my favourite really they
B	no I like hoodies I just don't like the those
A	I ain't got blue ones I got black ones
B	black ones navy
B	okay okay black
A	I want it to be er winter again so I can wear my hoodie
A	I I definitely prefer cold weather cos then you can actually really get warm and that feels really nice and also I don't find it that cold outside I really like the breeze and stuff sometimes it is really cold though I really like it cos you can get all cosy you can't get cosy here you have to jump in a fridge but even the fridge is warm
B	you can get cosy here
A	I can't get cosy
B	probably cos there's no carpets downstairs
A	no it's just it's summer everything's warm
B	oh
A	I can't get cosy
B	you get cosy in the evenings don't you?
A	no everything's too warm that's why I like the winter cos you can get all cosy and that feeling's the best and also when you're really hot and you're outside there's no way to cool down you're just
B	yeah but we go swimming
A	you're all hot and sticky and
B	that yeah but swimming's a nice way to cool down
B	stop it
B	a giddy mood I think not a goody mood a giddy mood
A	I said giddy mood
B	oh did you? oh
A	yeah what did you think I said?
B	goody mood
A	goody mood
