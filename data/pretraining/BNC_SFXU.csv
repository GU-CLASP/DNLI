D	yeah I know
B	mm

B	mm
D	and they had all their stuff all out on the road beautifully
A	mm

C	mm
B	that's horrible
D	so now you have to drive all the way up to their place
B	that's so mean
C	plus they do put the lists outside don't they but it's such a long drive down
A	hmm
D	I bet they don't sell hardly anything now because it's that's a bumpy old road and you've got to go all the way down to the bottom
A	no
C	no
A	sad
C	it's just in their shed
D	that's a shame because they've spoilt everything really haven't they by doing that
C	mm yeah
B	mm
A	yep
B	oi
C	no cos she was for enterprise and stuff
D	oh yeah
A	yeah but she's also the one that made people I don't know not really think about the consequences and do things for themselves
D	they did
A	yeah
D	yeah yeah we got forty pound a week
A	mm
C	mm
D	to run the business
A	mm
D	and if you had an enterprise you they we had the
C	it's still going
D	no I don't
A	mm
D	which they do
B	mm
D	and they just melt
C	he was very good
D	he was good
A	mm
B	and you claim for all of your costings? All of your overheads?
D	yeah yeah
B	well erm is that to take the tax off that is? That's not to claim for the cost is it
C	but you can only so much
D	yeah that's that's so but if you made too much money you'd pay less tax you see
B	yeah yeah cos we were talking about that
D	but we never did make any money to pay tax
B	ah
D	we didn't make enough to pay tax did we
C	did we?
D	we didn't pay tax did we?
C	we did pay tax yeah
D	did we? Oh you did you're the tax man
B	you don't know what the books look like
C	but we we had erm at the time we had the goats
B	mum does it all
C	goats business
B	yeah
C	and child minding so we did pay a bit of the tax
B	three books
D	three books yeah
B	three
C	three lots of books to do
B	three businesses
D	that's right yeah
B	we were thinking if we do freelance stuff you have to to claim
A	well we could claim on the computer and stuff like that couldn't we?
D	yeah yeah
B	well yeah you claim for the tax because it's a necessity
C	yeah
D	if you become self employed you claim for everything
C	mm
D	your work clothes
B	no
D	yeah
C	yeah
D	whatever you need for work you claim for
A	mm
D	all your
C	erm things like computers and things like that what it's er net capital expense
A	mm
C	alright cos it's a
A	mm
B	no
C	that goes down and then for the first year you can claim forty percent of it and then from then onwards it's twenty-five percent of of what's left
D	that go down
A	forty percent of?
C	of your computer
A	what the total cost?
D	yeah
A	no the
B	the tax
D	forty percent of the total cost isn't it
C	no well it comes down with your expenses right
D	yeah
C	so it's forget about the tax net at the moment
A	mm
C	because
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	right and and doing your other bits then you'd buy a computer cos you need the computer right
A	yeah
C	for the first year you can claim you can put it down as forty percent capital expenses to come off your what you've earnt
B	that's untaxable?
D	yeah
C	it's not
D	isn't it sorry sorry
B	sorry
C	suppose you earnt
B	they give you money free for a computer if you write to them and say I need a computer they give you the money?
D	no
C	no they don't give you any money that's you we for you to do
D	that's your allowance
C	you you decide you want the computer
B	yeah
C	so you buy a computer
D	and put it down as capital expenses
C	well yeah
B	mm
C	so supposing you earnt I don't know a hundred pound a week
B	mhm
C	right and you've also got the
D	cost
C	you take forty percent that's also deducted off your earnings
B	mm
D	so now you're earning whatever
C	it's just just one of those things and it you get it paid for in no time really
D	your computer get paid for by expenses to
C	it doesn't get paid for
B	who pays for my computer?
D	you
C	you do
B	oh
D	you have to pay
B	I thought you were selling me this this this great way free money
A	oh
D	no
C	no you you do it but but every time you you spend
B	mm
C	it's an expense from your business so that if if you earnt I don't know
D	whatever
B	mm
C	whatever
B	yes
C	so it brings down the level of what you actually earnt
B	yeah so that that's when it comes into the tax
C	so each time it brings down your level of what you've earnt
B	yeah yeah
D	this is why people these businesses change their car every three years or every two years some of them
C	mm
D	because they get loads of money
A	mm
D	they get the VAT back
B	mm
D	and if you  if you  er are registered VAT you don't pay any VAT
C	mm
B	yeah
D	you get twenty-five percent or twenty percent back on your computer anyway
B	so the government give you the VAT back?
D	yeah
C	mm
D	they send you a check
C	mm
B	I used to be really good at numbers and figures and I'm just been useless lately
D	but they they come and check you up to see if you're legitimate you know and and you're working properly and you're doing the books properly
B	mhm
C	how often do they do that?
D	well they
B	well they do spot checks don't they
C	they never did for us
D	they came down for Brian didn't they
C	yes they did
D	yeah
C	that that's because
D	yeah well that doesn't matter what what it was because of
C	yeah they did
A	mm
B	mm
C	mm
A	mm
C	off what?
A	claim for the VAT on silver
C	mm
D	that would make you a lot of money wouldn't it
A	you need  you need  silver for teaching
D	oh yeah you do
A	to give them as medals for good
A	for the kids
D	well
B	what time?
C	they're pretty fair though
D	point is with the tax people
B	mhm
D	I mean they've been in it ever since tax was invented and that's like handing down all these codes that that go into the computer you know
B	mhm
D	I mean my cousin you might not
B	mm
D	he ran an ice cream firm
B	mhm
D	right
B	yeah
D	so if he'd made say a hundred pound that day he'd put down fifty pound
B	yeah
D	and then he used to take holidays abroad and have a brand new car every year and then they look into that and think how are you affording it when you're not making any money? And of course they find out that you are fiddling the books
B	yeah they can find out easily I think
A	mm
C	yeah
D	they're they really helped us along
A	mm
B	mm
D	they really did
B	mm
C	they wrote a business thing for the child minders and they give you a whole list of don't forget to claim for like toiletries and things like that as well you know
B	yeah?
D	yeah yeah
C	Don't forget to claim for
D	but if you fiddle
C	but he said you can't claim for a a yacht just for the kids to go and play on
B	mm
C	you're allowed to and in the book it tells you it's to do with how many hours you work
B	yeah
C	erm telephone and stuff like that but it's
A	mm
B	mm
D	they're very good
A	mm
C	they're no problem
B	it's just the amount of I mean the tax is so high
A	well income tax isn't fair I don't think
D	no income tax isn't
A	it's the highest in Europe isn't it? And
D	yeah yeah
A	we're one of the highest in the world
D	well we've got twenty percent VAT and then you start off I think twenty percent income income tax now don't you
B	what was it twenty-two?
A	well we
B	and then well because then you've got to pay your stamp
D	yeah
A	national Insurance
C	yeah
D	national insurance is an awful amount of money
C	yeah no it was thirty
D	thirty-two
C	every three months was it?
B	see I don't want to get in trouble but I don't know what I'm
D	you just pay
B	I don't know really know what we're classed as really
C	oh I see yeah
D	well if you want to be private teachers you become self employed
A	mm
B	it's a little bit difficult for what
C	what as you carry on you mean?
B	what yeah yeah
C	without the teaching job
B	mm
A	well I looked on the
D	what? To be self employed?
A	no to pay your stamp
B	to pay your stamp
D	your stamp
A	er
D	there are
C	yeah it did
D	I remember that
A	what a month?
B	A month?
C	no every three months isn't it?
D	every three months yeah yeah
A	yeah?
B	what? Wow that's that's alright
D	that that just cover everything
B	I I don't think we can get it that cheap
A	no
B	mm
A	no cos it was a
C	no it was definitely every three months wasn't it
D	mm
B	with two pounds a day
A	it was about two grand a year isn't it?
B	thirty days is sixty pounds
A	it's about two thousand pounds a year
B	mm
D	was it? That's forty quid a week
A	yeah
C	what's that?
B	the National Insurance
D	national Insurance stamp
A	no
D	no
A	yeah
D	yeah yeah
C	mm
D	and that depends how much you earn
A	yeah
B	mm
D	that's not only  not only  income tax go up
B	yeah
A	mm
D	no
B	yeah but we still have to pay National Insurance stamp
A	yeah we should volunteer to pay that
D	not as though the pension is any good
B	well I know it's a bit confusing what to do
D	yeah yeah
C	mm
B	that would be awful if we came back and they said no you can't use it you haven't contributed
D	I mean that idiot Clegg
C	I wish I hadn't opted out of paying them
D	yeah you did opt out
B	you opted out of paying National?
C	about five years didn't I
D	yeah five years
B	yeah?
C	mm
D	couldn't you
B	what? Why did you opt out? You just didn't?
D	it's too late now
C	Cos we had such low earnings
B	mm
C	so you
D	but your pension go down you see
B	mm
D	because she get a pension and I get a pension
B	mm
D	and now that stupid idiot Clegg wants to tax pensions at source
A	can't tax a pension because that's been
B	you can't tax a pension because it's already been taxed
D	that is
C	no we don't tax the state pension
D	that's what they said
A	mm
D	that will probably get voted out of parliament but I mean that's that's what these stupid idiots want to do
A	mm
D	they want to just tax the ordinary person until they  until they  scream
C	they can't cos they don't earn enough
D	it's not a point of earning it's a point of taxing the pensions
C	I know they were going to tax pensions that you get from your work
D	yeah but they want to tax other pensions
C	okay
D	national pension at source
C	we just give you less money then
D	that's right
B	it still goes up then
D	yeah but they they can tell you how good they are by giving everybody two pound a week rise
B	mm
D	but undercover they're taking the money away from you
B	they take it back again
A	mm they change it every year to so you don't know how it works
B	mm
D	they do
A	that's the whole point
D	black market is the best tax system
D	that is
A	that's how it works in most of the world
D	that is
A	mm
D	give me a bit of money and you're free
B	yeah but if you haven't got any money
A	yeah that's the down side
D	well you're in
C	no it's like my tax thing should be coming through soon so you can have a look at the book
D	yeah
B	oh that's your
A	mm
B	so you've done you've filled out all of the books for April? You've sent them all away
C	what I mean is the forms that they send you should be arriving soon
D	yeah
B	oh I thought they all had to be in by April
C	they have to be in for January thirty first
B	oh
C	that's the very last
