A	ah okay let's discuss eh let's discuss our
B	life
A	yeah no no okay eh other teachers
B	you what did you want to be as a child?
A	a barrister I mean
B	no no no no I mean as a child not like as a you weren't born a four-year-old
B	fine okay watch this right when you were the youngest you know okay obviously football it's football alright obviously
A	I didn't care yeah football
A	I didn't I wanted to be eh I didn't want to be I didn't want to be an astronaut or a firefighter or a
B	I did no not firefighter I didn't want to be anything where I had to probably die
A	yeah
B	I I and I and back then I didn't realise that there were so many failed Apollo missions
A	yeah
B	before they actually got to space
A	ah no not Apollo erm
B	no cos no one tells you what death is
A	I know exactly
B	no one tells you you're going to die in like
A	we don't have as much of a regard for death as did you ever? oh a swear word
B	yeah you know? you know that everyone grows up at some point yeah?
A	yeah
B	I'm at that phase where I'm not grown up yet I still want to be something like an astronaut or something
A	yeah yeah but to become an astronaut that would require
B	physics degree yeah
A	maybe a physics degree but do you think working from an early age? to as as in commit to an
B	well erm
A	I don't I don't know
B	Neil Neil Armstrong right?
A	yeah Neil Armstrong
B	erm he
A	oh yeah
B	he flew erm air bombing missions in a in a the Korean War
A	did he?
B	yeah he
A	oh shit
B	yeah he he he had like a crap load of successful er missions in Korean War
A	yeah
B	and after that cos he was so great
A	yeah
B	erm that you know the NASA recruited him because he was the best pilot they could find
A	damn so he he he he but did he have a physics degree before he became a a pilot?
B	no he he was part of the air force
A	damn
B	I guess now you do because if you there's there's a finite
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	maybe not cos their rocket blew up
A	they still don't I know that I'm not
B	no no no that was a private company that was a private company
A	was it really? oh okay
B	yeah NASA know NASA know how to get people to space
A	I understand
B	yeah yeah that's why they need private companies
A	that's why oh alright investment
B	and
A	that's what we should be investing in like er ah I wish I had the statistics on erm on America's use of er
B	yeah like you realise they yeah but their military invented duct tape Velcro?
A	did it?
A	we invented the jet we gave them the jet after World War Two apparently
A	yeah yeah
B	and erm
A	he was British
B	yeah he was British but er and er this started at like thirty-nine right?
A	yeah yeah
B	and and he he campaigned for years and years and years trying to get his idea picked up by the military
A	yeah yeah
B	it wouldn't have it it wasn't until like after the the er Second World War that that
A	yeah yeah
B	and then they decided to take his idea
A	yeah I see well the whole world steals for for everyone's own please
B	yeah yeah it's like erm yeah in in king James' time isn't it? monopolies were always people that invented stuff
A	yeah
B	I guess that I
B	because if you you were the first person
A	it's like a patent
B	yeah no no it's not like a patent because you can you can like patent say you invented the hoover tomorrow yeah?
A	yeah
B	and the hoover hadn't been invented you invent the hoover you can't patent the hoover
A	yeah
B	you can patent the the things that you make the hoover out of and the systems you use
A	oh right right
B	but you can't patent the hoover that means that if if if I come tomorrow or the day after and I make a a
A	right yeah
B	a vacuum
A	yeah
B	cleaner and but it uses different parts
A	yeah
A	right right right
B	so
A	so it that's an issue with the patent though like
B	no it's not well because you
A	that they're not specific enough or they're not
A	yeah yeah that's good yeah
B	so so if you invented the computer say as Alan Turing did in eh World War Two
A	yeah
B	he you should have ah undisputed rights to every single computer
A	yeah okay
B	and then there's the flip side of that that people say that that's anti-capitalistic whereas that you have a then have a situation where you have a monopoly
A	yeah
B	where erm whereby one person controls the complete market share
A	right right
A	yeah it's it's it's it's eh so it's like but that I think the issue with patents is that they they hinder the progress of anything creative
B	no patents don't monopolies do
A	or
B	that's that's that's that was their original argument against monopolies because
A	yeah monopolies yeah okay monopolies existed since seventeen hundreds in
B	I mean arguably they still do because
A	yeah
B	you have like oil and gas monopolies
A	right right yeah yeah yeah that that
B	in the end big six six energy companies
A	yeah
B	it's weird how none of their prices ever drop and they all move it up at the same time
A	yeah I know I know that's just competition with allies though
B	yeah
B	by by definition if you're controlling market that makes it monopoly
A	yeah yeah I see that
B	so that's the
A	yeah
B	you would you could get like
A	yeah
B	and I think
A	well okay
B	but on the flip side people that erm eh seek to monopolise a market that can't it's it's like like everything it's nearly impossible to strike up a perfect balance
A	yeah but just because you invent something
B	yeah
A	erm just because eh what was I saying? erm just because you're inventing erm yeah just because you manage to invent something you you said they should be protected more
B	yeah
A	doesn't that theoretically mean that in like fifty years or a hundred years or there's going to be a point where it's becoming eh a a a less likely or a smaller chance that you're going to create something then isn't that? I mean isn't that unfair? why don't we reward people for?
B	no but I know that
A	yeah
B	with a risk of becoming a billionaire or you you can create an amazing product and lose get get absolutely nothing
A	yeah
B	whereas
A	yeah
B	that you would not get nothing out of inventing something
A	yeah
B	more people would you know quit their day job and and pursue you know trying to make something you know
A	and we shouldn't be
A	I mean because because
B	cos every right everything
A	and inventions are so they're so scarce now even in the past they were so scarce
B	exactly that's the issue
A	ah oh no no no no no no I think I think we're over-inspiring I'm saying scarce I'm saying scarce as in it's hard to create something that is original and can be marketed
A	yeah
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	but a lot of them don't have
A	no
B	and the the second thing which is an issue you know we're basically talking about is they they're they're not monetarily sustainable
A	yeah but you don't want to be encouraging people all these people to quit their day jobs for a cause that is very
B	right you got alright look at the unemployment yeah?
A	yeah
B	if more people quit their jobs and went into you're getting more people do the Steve Jobs Steve Wozniak deal or a Bill Gates
A	that was so rare that's mostly with like innovative speakers
B	that's so rare because not not that many people are trying it
A	no some people how many?
B	you you realise that there's a certain probability something's going to happen
A	yeah
B	the more times you you test that
A	yeah
B	the more like the more results you're likely to have
A	yeah yeah
B	Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak yeah?
A	yeah
B	they set up a business in their garage
A	yeah
B	who does that now? who sets up a business in their garage?
A	people try people
B	yeah
A	and yet they can't make money out of it they get no success it's impossible
B	that's the issue they don't make money out of it we need to help them make financially sustainable
B	yeah but
A	yeah
B	the profit you make isn't going into the pockets of the person that owns the company if you
A	yeah
B	you
A	how hard is? yeah
B	because it doesn't matter if the
A	yeah
B	because at the end of the day you're still getting paid
A	but they're going to be making a loss as in how hard is it to be freelance? or or or or self-employed and make money?
B	it is hard we we need to help them because
A	yeah
B	at the end of the day we we have a you you look at the computing sector or the gaming sector
A	yeah
B	erm the movie sector we are miles behind the likes of America and China
A	yeah
B	eh and even India right?
A	yeah
B	we are miles behind because people don't
A	but look what that's resulted in
B	you know that's not resulted in anything good because at the end of the day you look at it a mountain of things that erm America and China will invent yeah?
A	yeah
B	they're pushing for why are all the big like mobile
A	we
B	the the way of thinking that well why? why let? why try and work hard and invent something else
A	yeah
B	it doesn't matter that cos China are going to undercut us and we have America over there we have India with a a
A	yeah I mean but you don't want to
B	that's the mentality as much as anything else
A	I think it's as much to do with the work ethic as it is has to do with encouraging people to make inventions and the
B	yeah I know but the the point is that they invested in their people
A	yeah by forcing them to work by controlling them by giving them hard hours
B	I mean yeah I know but
A	yeah okay
B	obviously they're still it's not perfect you still have a a communist regime and you can't talk out against it
A	yeah
B	you have the Hong Kong umbrella riots
A	yeah yeah
B	but but the point is there's they there's been you've seen a stark amount of investment from erm you know communist regime
A	yeah yeah
B	industrialise you know agriculture
A	yeah
B	there there's now no more of that as compared to erm we have erm now er a a market where we can start selling people stuff to consumers we can we can you know?
A	yeah
B	work that way and that's what they try and do they're investing that way that's why their er the
A	yeah we do
B	erm I don't one of the most
B	Chinese company they invent it they make it cheap
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	it's all about trying to now change from like industry to try and make stuff that the consumer
A	innovative yeah yeah but they do I mean they do that well I guess Japan does it in a similar way but they don't have
B	well
A	they're they're just innovative in everything they do
B	I know but their their issue is that they don't spend enough money
A	yeah okay but they're they're not in as debt as bloody Britain or America
B	like that's why they they no well China are in a massive amount of debt
A	or China are
B	China are in a
A	China's growing though China is sustainable
B	yeah I know that's the difference the China's debt in being investment
A	yeah
B	they they unlike us we we we
A	yeah
B	has been through erm investing in their er in their country and in their people in their new innovation
A	we the NHS is investing in our people maybe not fundamentally or ideologically but healthcare is better erm er school education
B	education is a
A	yeah
B	every country will have these costs right?
A	yeah
B	unless you're America and you try and do an ObamaCare system
A	yeah ObamaCare
B	okay? but everything will have a set amount of cost what China
A	yeah
B	that you spend on education and healthcare and they've got the the best that they can possibly get even though they have a billion people
A	yeah
B	and it must be hard to
A	yeah
B	they've managed to do that whilst also with the surplus money they've had
A	yeah
B	they've invested it
A	they have and they've done that well yeah
A	yeah
B	they they wasted the
A	yeah
B	they
A	yeah
B	and then a massive windfall of millions and they did not invest it correctly
A	so so you think it's it
B	yeah by
A	for yeah yeah that's true alright I got to go yeah?
