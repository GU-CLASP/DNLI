B	cos he's always wanted to do it then?
A	yes
B	yeah I know
A	he said
B	yeah
A	I didn't get chance he was too outraged
B	mum's not mum's not there
A	I know that
B	that is the main reason
A	I know because that was always five to one
B	because she was
A	I know
A	and of course
B	on the table for one o'clock yeah
A	now you're telling me your sister's gonna do it at half past two? I said

B	yeah
A	and she she said well we never get our Christmas lunch till half past two three o'clock because that's when
B	mm
A	so you might wanna talk to him about it yourself
A	because he was so outraged
B	look no because I did Christmas another ten years before you did Christmas dinner
A	I know
B	and I always got it at the table for one o'clock because when the kids were little
A	well
B	the kids were all little the kids all wanted it
A	yeah oh yeah no no I know that and I'm always ready for it if I'm honest
B	yeah but Christmas
A	yes

B	brunch
A	you know we can have something nice
B	mm
A	yes yes he said he will he will
B	yes
A	she said the only the only downside to not cooking you know at Christmas is that you don't have any leftovers I said oh I shouldn't worry
B	mm
A	I said I said my biggest challenge will
B	and a ham
A	will be to make sure it's not a sixteen pound turkey
B	yeah

B	well you're the one there
A	set really

B	they haven't down there have they those houses?
A	er and they're all shared drives and
B	mm
A	but yeah

B	mm
A	so
B	mm
A	I took
B	oh right yes
A	some random woman I was talking to told me about
A	so we went to the opening night
B	yeah
A	it was alright it wasn't really anything you'd buy
B	what they selling?
A	well I was expecting it to be gifts from what
B	mm
A	this lady had said
B	mm
A	and then there was just
B	mm
A	dear
B	mm
A	it was weird anyway
B	well you were talking about
A	oh
B	well it seems money is the main issue there
A	oh yeah
B	so did I tell you when I saw her last and hadn't really mentioned it? but erm
A	yeah you said that she got three or four properties?
B	well she had a lot of money
A	mm
B	before she split up with

B	and of course they
B	only died recently
A	oh
B	so her and
A	oh okay
B	probably two years ago
A	oh yes yes yes

A	mm
B	and they rent it
B	no no no no he lives with
A	I was gonna say
B	yeah he moved in a while ago
A	they rent it out?
B	so the rental income that comes in they get half each and they get half each and they do half the maintenance
A	oh
B	so he pays her
A	right
B	but will not contribute to anything
A	mm
B	and
A	what does he do for a job?
