B	uh
A	you know cos the boiler's been funny
B	well there's been a
A	in the cupboard?
B	yeah that you can
A	yeah
B	you know the symbol of the flame on the  on the  dial at the top
A	oh right
B	on the dial on the temperature dial?
A	I hadn't noticed
B	I I thought you said that we weren't supposed to go past the flame
A	we're not supposed to go past that little mark have you seen the little like pencil line?
B	yeah that's what I meant like the flame thing?
A	what flame?
B	that's that's what it looked to me like a flame the mark
A	oh
B	yeah so said we we shouldn't need to go past that
A	Cos he said we shouldn't go past that because it's hard water and then it like gets clogs in the pipes or something
B	yeah if
A	if you put it on really high it makes the water like more likely to
B	right
A	which is probably what's happened anyway
B	it may be happening anyway yeah but uh
A	I wasn't cold this morning or anything
B	it has been like the
A	yeah
B	uh we'll probably have to get in touch with
A	no well
B	uh I mean I could
A	I don't like the idea of the boiler just like blasting away and then
B	well no I don't mean turn it really high I just mean just recording what the temperature is in the room
A	yeah
B	if we did but actually I had I hadn't set that one on the right temperature though cos
A	I
B	each
A	I know
B	and you can set the weekend but uh
A	the wake and the waking and leaving and returning and sleeping times
B	yeah including so a total of say like four per day different times
A	yeah
B	um and for the three rooms so there's a lot of different
A	I think you can add other ones as well if you wanted to
B	there's a lot of different
A	ah right so it wasn't
B	it wasn't programmed our bedroom wasn't programmed to do twenty-two
A	aha
B	and I was complaining that it hadn't done
A	ah I see
B	if you put this one here and the living room on twenty-two for an hour it probably won't get there on the current settings
A	no but it used to though didn't it?
B	I don't know
A	I think so
B	I don't know for certain
A	unless it was just warmer I mean
B	I don't know for certain
A	it has been freezing it was so cold today
B	to be honest we
A	we need to do some empirical tests
B	uh cos it may just be the fact that it's colder outside
A	Cos I can't remember what happened last year like I can't remember if it was freezing last
B	uh well we had a really cold um winter
A	did we have to put the boiler up? Did I turn the boiler up or not?
B	I think we just cranked  we just cranked  the boiler up a bit higher
A	did we?
B	and and just put up with that I I kind of suspect that it's just a combination of cranking the boiler up and
A	okay
B	I thought it might need bleeding so I obviously took all of the stuff out of the way to check
A	yeah
B	and
A	I know I need to
B	there are  there are  the sort of two bleeding holes there
A	yeah
B	but I suppose I wouldn't wanna bleed it myself
A	two bleeding holes
B	well
A	all that
B	well just
A	yeah
B	um and then uh we'll see what happens then
A	Cos there's all those like
B	if
A	no
B	so I don't know it
A	yeah
B	or the
A	I know
B	but it might  it might  make more sense for him to do for us to do that lot when we move out of here
A	well
B	no
A	but um
B	yeah um
A	have you asked your mum about it yet?
B	we
A	Will your mam not know?
B	if we're
A	Cos your parents might not even be going
B	yeah cos
A	yeah
B	then they uh one of them and the when they start  when they start  the caravan cos they don't use at winter so they they have to sort of
A	oh yeah that's right it goes to sleep I forgot about that
B	yeah so in the  in the  sort of April one that they go at
A	yeah
B	they have to sort of wake it up
A	yeah
B	for the
A	all the stuff in? The electricity?
B	then
A	I forgot about that
B	then so they go
A	in the summer  in the summer  holidays?
B	yeah
A	I'm not set I haven't got me heart set on that
B	yeah
A	it'll not be too cold though will it?
B	uh well that it's hard to tell isn't it I mean I doubt it
A	be rainy
B	uh yeah yeah yeah it can be
A	it's part of the fun though I suppose
B	but but with camping I suppose it
A	yeah
B	so so one of them's got a caravan so we can possibly hang hang around in their  in their  caravan
A	get warm
B	I know well you well uh
A	I'd be a bit scared
B	not sure if they've still got them
A	no but if your mam and dad's there
B	no more than two dogs in
A	oh Ben won't be able to go will he? He's too old now
B	yeah so um that's a shame actually but their dogs are probably getting old as well
A	what was he called like
B	uh
A	what's her second name?
B	what?
B	surname
A	yeah
B	so he was actually yeah his name was actually
B	um
A	like The Bodyguard
B	oh well there was uh
A	or like um
B	oh
A	it had like twenty names
B	what was it? There was Lucky but no there was
A	no
B	the they always give them a lot of middles names but um
A	I know yeah
B	so yeah so we would be
A	but I think this time we should get like
B	in
A	but I think we should like invest in more like camping gadgets this time
B	yeah probably we've gotta up
A	enter into the camping spirit
B	up a gear you know and go to a greater greater trouble to
A	or we could just do it Ray Mears style
B	yeah should uh
A	shoot ourselves a wild boar and
B	I dunno how um
A	get ourselves a wild boar
B	um I don't  I don't  have a gun though so
A	fashion some cutlery out of a tree stump
B	D'you d'you uh
A	A wild boar? Oh with great difficulty I
B	uh uh there won't be any wild boars but there might be a couple of rabbits or?
A	on that programme they just shot them didn't they?
B	um yeah that was uh
A	maybe we'll get them
B	you talking about the gypsy programme?
A	maybe this this weekend's turned into something quite different to just to a camping trip
B	yeah we don't wanna sort of
B	to go
A	Claire and Matt back to nature
B	um so yeah but we're at
A	D'you remember that Ray Mears? Yeah I think so
B	uh
A	somebody must
B	D'you know one the one when Ray Mears did a roast hog or something?
A	yeah and he spent like Ray
B	yeah
A	that's right
B	uh two stick holders or they're called andirons or are they?
A	are they really? Have you just made that up?
B	they're things  they're things  that hold the stick
A	how on earth do you know that?
B	they put
A	andirons?
B	they're the things on the uh
A	what pub quiz was that?
B	the things you put on a fire and they have like a hand thing like that and they're sort of like
A	oh
B	something like that anyway yeah
A	uhuh
B	sorry two ones that rest hold it up and then the
A	yeah
B	and he put his pig on the and he made a fire underneath
A	yeah
B	then he  then he
B	but while  but while  he was making the brush
A	he was putting like honey
B	he got uh he well he had these he had his glaze you know to put but while he was  while he was  uh
A	yeah
B	meanwhile the pig's totally burnt
A	aw
B	yeah he was just spent all his time doing uh
A	aw silly Ray Mears
B	doing his uh with a wooden brush which didn't even work and it wasn't a proper brush it was just like a stick with like some holes in the end of it
