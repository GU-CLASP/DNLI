A	I'm just gonna go go and get the salt
B	do that is there not salt and vinegar on them already?
A	not no not
B	oh okay alright
C	that's alright
D	upset so if somebody doesn't want vinegar
B	too true that's true yeah
D	hello
B	welcome yes so
C	really?
B	that's quite exciting isn't it?
D	well done him
C	surprised he had the intelligence
B	well I'm not
C	really
D	no
C	or that he was able to find
B	well he must have known our landline number I guess
A	oh shit the ketchup
C	that's also extremely impressive
A	ketchup
D	I mean that's hugely impressive
B	and
B	and I think he's reasonably low on money but he reckoned but he's got his cash card now and so he can get money out
B	yeah and impressed with it and the last we got
D	it I got an enormous amount of chips that I'm not going erm it it I does
E	no no no that's alright thank you
D	travel card erm would apply also
B	oh yeah I guess so yeah yeah yeah I don't think anyone ever questions that yeah
E	oh sorry yeah
D	yeah because that's the one one of the ones that goes through
B	none of them it's very interesting actually it's never recommended for you to change at
E	mm
B	and the the the trains aren't linked together so there's no principle for holding one if the other wasn't going so you need to know for sure when you get on at
D	yeah
E	mm
D	that's how we got stuck
B	yeah and then it tends to be two hours but erm
E	was that cos he's just missed the one he normally catches or
B	I don't know why he's done this and he's
E	right
B	so yeah I didn't I didn't know cos I hadn't mentioned to him
C	why? why didn't he just take the normal route?
D	cos it's very
B	because it only goes once an hour
E	oh that's good
B	and if you there is every other hour if you missed one there's one you can get that goes via
E	mm
B	so hopefully he will get something to eat but what was it he bought the day that we went to the theatre last time
C	no idea can't remember
B	he bought erm like five of those breakfast bar things
A	oh yeah
C	erm
B	for supper
D	well it is is the erm theatre at seven thirty or at seven?
B	yeah I think so and it's five thirty yeah
D	well also particularly the way the road is I mean that's quick too
B	mm yes so
D	but you would be sitting
E	mm
B	mm
C	what are you watching?
D	Don Quixote
C	oh yeah that's
B	you didn't go cos you wanted to go to the
E	mm mm
C	yeah but how old is
C	well
B	is there an age?
B	well maybe
C	cos all her face her family do archery as well
B	yeah but with archery there's always insurance malarkey
C	yeah
E	mm
B	well I say malarkey very important
D	can you pour me some water please
B	yeah
C	fine
B	well you brought home a report a few days ago which is all As so we sat down you know how funny teachers are but the teacher says so is there anything that you're thinking? and
B	and the teacher said now what makes you think that?
D	they're not A stars
B	does he? he certainly didn't get that joke no erm
D	mm
B	then between them
C	ah
B	so
B	so why
E	that's good well done well done
B	are you happy darling?
C	yeah definitely
D	cos you know he's missed a few bits on and off you know that doesn't help really
B	doesn't help what?
D	catching up
B	well he doesn't need to catch up he's ahead
D	yeah well at some point I guess he might miss something
B	mm
B	oh I wonder if that's
D	so archery for you tonight? that's alright darling archery for you you tonight love?
C	mm mm
D	yep are you taking him er
E	yeah I'll take him yep
D	and then you prefer to be picked up at quarter to rather than nine?
E	about quarter to nine isn't it?
D	yep
C	yep about quarter to nine
E	quarter to yeah
B	okay
D	must be
E	mm well a moon
E	erm
C	yeah great one
D	today alright for both of you was it?
A	mm mm
D	yep?
C	fine
D	well I suppose yours was partly taken up with was it after school?
C	er no it was for like ten minutes in the middle of a lesson
D	seems like quite a good idea though I mean lots of parents can't get there in the day but when you when you can takes the pressure off the teachers for the evening too doesn't it?
A	erm
C	erm they mum's just gonna say if it is then they're sending everyone letters so
D	yeah
E	yes we couldn't there was something on the internet but it was so confusing the way it was written
D	yes it's to do with the switch whether it's auto or not
E	something to do with the
D	mm mm
B	okay?
D	oh yeah they'll if you'll get you'll certainly get a letter
C	who's that?
B	oh somebody's
C	what does she want you to do?
B	music
C	gosh how patronising
B	do you think that's patronising?
C	yes
B	well these these kids were not the kind of autistic erm you know brilliant people who can do lots of complicated tech work these are kids who like to stack shelves and so there were three of them erm making boxes where you kind of have to fold the boxes together and put the insert in and they're all there and they were loving it absolutely loving it so
E	a simple task that they could just repeat and repeat and repeat
B	yeah the repetitive yeah exactly yeah yeah
E	mm
B	all happening out of this people's erm conservatory basically it's complete chaos like these chocolate making machines and stuff
D	mm
E	and and and what made the person decide that I'll make chocolates and get the children to you know autistic children
B	well the mum and dad have got the young mum and dad have got an autistic son
E	right
B	and erm they came here from Pakistan so he's now seventeen and they came when he was about seven so when he was when when they realised he had autism they looked to leave Pakistan because there's no kind of acceptance of it all
E	mm
B	erm and he's clearly a very bright person so he applied for a erm
E	mm mm
B	erm where they granted him a skilled workers visa and said that he could come his wife could come his daughter could come but his son couldn't come
C	ah huh
B	and er and the same thing happened in Canada
D	really?
B	yeah so like just explicitly erm race oh not racist discriminatory er
D	gosh
C	surprising
C	well actually Australia does have a really tight border control
B	yeah and increasingly so yeah
A	it's well it's cos it's an island so
C	so's Britain
A	we have much more erm
B	we've got much more
A	we're much we're much closer
B	much more integration?
A	mm yeah that
B	mm mm
C	yeah but Pakistan would be
B	well yeah and the bloke was lucky he was obviously yeah he's so he's been working out of a tech company and she was doing something or other the wife and then also made chocolates
A	mm
B	and the boy was getting older and older and I guess her interest in chocolate making kind of developed into
E	full-time deal mm
D	oh right
B	mm
E	do they sell nationally then? or locally? or
B	yeah erm they sell on they're really they've got much more
E	oh right
B	they sell them to Johnson and Johnson was their first customer kind of as corporate gifts
E	right
B	erm and they have quiet spikes around kind of Christmas and Valentine's and then recently they've started selling to some high-end hotel chains they're going to leave in the er in the rooms or whatever cos that's not quite so seasonal so hopefully that'll the
E	mm
B	and they do kind of special ones that are then
B	not as seasonal as chocolates I mean it's really Valentine's Day and Christmas
E	yes it is isn't it?
B	mm yeah they describe the Valentine's Day as Easter period as one period that yeah
D	I find it amazing there are so many chocolate makers
B	mm and they've been offered right from the beginning they were offered cos they they
D	gosh
B	but B
D	yeah
B	a year later
D	mm
B	er it's kind of yeah
D	yes I have a small investment in
B	was that in
D	no
B	okay which ethical chocolate manufacturer is there?
D	the company's called
B	yeah but as it happens I've got an interest in niche ethical businesses in the chocolate field
D	mm
B	so I do know quite a lot of them
B	mm okay
B	mm I've never come across that one there you go and do they
D	I only know in
B	what you made a one-off investment into it?
D	no no no I shouldn't imagine my
B	mm mm
D	I invest in a small number of start-up companies to an ethical scheme
B	so is that the clearly
D	mm?
B	is this
D	yes
D	how'd you mean?
D	right
E	no the name of the company is
D	no
E	that you put money into and then
D	ethics
B	oh it's for ethics right yeah
B	okay so that's not yeah okay so that's not quite how you what you described but anyway yeah
D	mm yeah I didn't describe very well as I say I shouldn't have opened my mouth but at the time
B	well it's worth bearing in mind that when
D	I know that I know about that
B	I I know quite a lot more about this than
D	I know you do and he says so too yeah
B	anyway I've never heard of
D	I I just
B	buying out there like perfume and
D	I really
B	well it is still there
D	I know but it has I don't know maybe just that corporate stuff
B	have you ever been
C	what the is it called the
B	ever thought you might do
C	no
A	I think we did actually
A	we did
B	we did what you and me?
A	no at school on our school trip to
C	you can eat loads of posh chocolates
B	oh
C	uhu
B	and and you went the chocolate shop?
A	we went yeah we went on trips around chocolate shops in
C	doss
B	I don't remember that
A	erm no
D	you saw them making chocolates?
A	no
D	no
E	just just shops that sold it? oh right okay
C	that's like like
D	we do
B	oh that's right because you you ate chocolate less even less then than you do now didn't you? that's right that's right that's right so you so it wasn't such a great trip for you
C	ha
B	but did you like the Marmite chocolate?
C	I know you hated that one
A	no I like it
E	Marmite chocolate?
A	yeah
C	exactly
A	at the end of the tour we got to make our own chocolates
D	did it taste like Marmite or chocolate?
A	it tastes like both
A	it was amazing
C	yeah true
A	but it was homemade so
C	I knew it
D	I mean I thought we'd established that really Marmite is fine as Marmite but not if we start doing anything else with it
B	mm mm
C	yeah like Marmite crisps sometimes
A	they're revolting
C	yeah
B	but it's funny because you like yeast rice cakes but not Marmite rice cakes
C	yeah you do you like Marmite rice cakes don't you?
A	they're yeast
B	no yeah we call them er rice cakes but the ones we actually get are not the Marmite brand ones they're just yeast rice cakes
B	sorry?
C	you used to get through bags er boxes of them
B	we still would if we if we bought them
A	well we don't buy them
B	well it's not that we never buy them they're just not that easy to come by
A	mm
B	cos there are so many billions of flavours of rice cakes
A	it's really fun
C	no rice cakes are that nice anyway
B	what? in your view there are just like loads of crazy flavours aren't there
D	it was really difficult to get hold of the one that you liked
B	the one he likes exactly
E	mm yeah
B	and where they do do the kinda Marmitey flavour ones they do the Marmite ones rather than the yeast ones yeah
D	you don't
B	they do sell them in the health food shop in town
B	I
A	they were very nice
B	I'll get you some more
A	how much did that cost?
B	well I've got a feeling they might be a couple of pounds I reckon I won't you know when I bought these
C	they look like they're made up of air
B	well they've got rice in them
E	yeah I will I'm quite hungry
A	Marmite yeast
E	thank you very much
B	I mean you could say that of lots of things like I dunno rice pops
C	they're actually made of rice
A	yeah
B	I suppose so
A	yeah they are
B	it's funny though what have we done to rice to turn them into rice pops
C	they probably heat it somehow
D	yes they are
B	what like popcorn?
E	mm I think so I think you just
C	so each one of these was a grain of rice?
B	that has exploded
E	mm
A	ingredients were sugar salt barley and malt extract and
C	I don't really care at all
D	you've managed to move the the freezer back
B	mm mm mm mm mm mm
D	the freezer's seen better days
B	it's not very old
D	no I know I don't know what year but it well it's probably seven
B	yeah but it's since you moved here right?
D	yeah yeah
B	mm
D	yeah
B	I was thinking when I moved it back in er it has got quite knackered erm and I was loud that I never took the plastic wrapping off it to begin with because
E	mm
B	yeah
D	the freezer what darling?
B	that it replaced the one we had beforehand I think was a very old freezer I can't remember where it came from I've got a feeling it was very old
D	it was an ice cream freezer wasn't it?
B	oh
D	no no no
B	what makes something an ice cream freezer then?
D	I don't know I remember I remember taking in
D	you didn't always have it
B	no I think she gave it to us when she was er I said we put it in our
B	and funny enough she emailed me this week and we arranged to have a coffee in a couple of weeks time
D	oh good
B	sorry?
B	are you being rude?
C	mm
B	did you put your
D	what's
B	I don't know could you pull your chair in properly and sit up properly and use the correct posture?
C	mm
B	that's not really correct is it?
C	you're not really correct are you? ha
B	try again
C	yes mother
B	thank you darling

D	and is there a new one out?
C	yep
B	is it actually out or is it coming out?
C	er yeah it's actually out
B	and what rating is it?
C	sixteen I should imagine

A	yeah
D	yeah no that's what I meant I knew it I knew that somewhere but I wondered where your choice was love
A	oh no I haven't chosen
B	I've asked him to choose and so far
D	it's your birthday
B	he's said er make it a surprise and I've said it's your birthday but he'd like a surprise it might go horribly wrong
D	basically I just don't want
B	we might go to some sophisticated fish restaurant or something darling
E	the café in Waitrose how about that?
B	the new café in
E	ah
B	so have you been? no? you're probably just
D	no
E	no no absolutely not no no no
D	and they've extended the bar along and even more of these bar along and even more of these bar
B	yeah yes
D	and then
D	and then there are one two three four tables and chairs outside in each of those alcoves in that passageway
B	they're not really alcoves
E	no
D	do you go along that bit?
B	yeah yeah
D	on your bike?
B	when you're finished with your bike
D	I I
B	when you're finished shopping yeah you do
D	I imagine you have to fight people who don't approve of you cycling on that bit but there we are
B	you don't come across very many people but if it's a full bloody café tables in the way then that's certainly not gonna help matters
D	right yes so this is and the whole store has become so cluttered of course
C	I think there's a word for this
D	what?
C	first world problems
B	yes
C	yeah whatever
B	yeah whatever
C	it's not a hashtag
B	sorry?

B	write something exactly
B	and
D	do you know what you're
B	I'm hoping on on Sunday please stop it
C	I was provoked like a lot
B	you weren't provoked like a lot
C	I was were you listening?
C	you keep saying
C	I he keeps saying he
C	all over the weekend he kept going pika I can't even do it it's highest
B	he'd go what?
C	yeah
A	pika
B	sorry?
C	he keeps he's been doing that all weekend and it's so fucking annoying
B	going Pikachu?
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	it's really
C	I can't stand it
B	wait why did you still like doing it?
B	I didn't know I didn't know
A	er
C	it's cos it's annoying and we were at dad's at the weekend so
C	see he's like
B	he didn't do it yesterday evening at all I don't think
C	well that's probably cos he forgot about it or you weren't listening or
D	maybe maybe you can just train your brain not to
C	well no
B	no
C	it's
A	chu
B	responding it or reacting to it is not gonna help matters
C	well I dunno I think it'd make me feel a lot better if I punched him
B	well I I
E	you're supposed to turn the other cheek
B	erm I erm used violence the other day and found it rather effective didn't I? with you wasn't it
C	a a distraction
B	well he was doing something like this repeating something
A	Pikachu
B	so I said if you do that again I'm going to hit you over the head with my rolled up newspaper and then I did and then he stopped it was brilliant
A	it was
B	yes and then you see
C	with what?
B	then it escalated yeah so then mm
C	yeah that's not gonna stop me from destroying him
B	but in the immediate aftermath of the initial er initial hitting him with the newspaper er he did stop in shock that I actually had
C	you're dead mate
A	chu
B	so
A	pika pika
B	at the erm archery
C	the archery
B	yes erm
A	Pikachu
D	and
C	yeah I'm gonna do some when I get back
B	and I don't suppose
D	well I generally think they go through till ten all of them really
B	really? I think it's more like half past nine isn't that funny
C	we usually get back after half nine
B	they er have these days they always have a sign up showing what time the show finishes
C	yeah have done for years
B	oh they have a sign up now in the in the erm in the green room there
D	well this is so sensible
E	mm mm
B	it is so sensible
C	it's been there for years
D	oh I think it's very important to be very helpful
B	absolutely yeah
B	cos all these things do have a very specific running time I think quite often at the
B	have you been to see James Bond yet?
D	no we wouldn't really
B	it does go on forever
E	no not something that that that we would
D	I don't think it
D	well with cinemas there's usually a car park isn't there? and so people with theatre especially sometimes you know it's so people
B	well yeah so you can get picked up yeah yeah yeah
E	no I don't think so wait till it comes on the telly at Christmas
D	probably won't even
B	would you say it's right about James Bond boys?
D	I believe it hasn't gone down very well in the States
C	it wasn't very good
B	I
A	better than Skyfall
B	I don't know what they're all complaining about
C	no it wasn't
A	Skyfall sucked
C	no it didn't it was the best one in like ages
A	it was the best one when you say ages it was the best
C	it was the best one since they stopped writing them from the books
A	which was the one before that
C	yeah I know well these three the last three have all been crap so
C	Skyfall Skyfall's pretty good actually mm
A	what was that
C	Quantum of Solace the last one
A	Quantum of Solace is the worst one ever
D	he was the one who engineered that that erm that early James Bond you know when he flew with the pack
E	jetpack?
D	yeah
B	that was made by Vinton's?
D	wasn't it? was it Mr Vinton? it was made by them
B	I didn't know that
D	no?
E	I thought it was an American thing that the space people used
B	and was that in James Bond or was that in a Madness video?
D	oh I think it was James Bond
B	okay before the band's
E	it certainly it certainly appeared
B	and he says that Vinton's designed the
B	jet pack that made
E	it was in it was in one of the early ones
D	or wasn't it a plane?
E	From Russia With Love no the little plane was the the little plane was the one with the heli rotor what are they called?
D	that one the
C	gyrocopter
E	gyrocopter
D	the gyrocopter he made that one
C	oh I've seen that one that's in
B	when you say he do you mean
D	well in those days it was quite a small company and I mean it was him
B	right
D	very
B	right okay
E	oh right I didn't know that
D	but I
B	well it sounds plausible
E	I thought the man
D	you've seen him being interviewed
E	I thought he'd died some time ago
B	so I haven't heard any though I was surprised to know he's alive cos yeah you would have thought he'd get a mention a
E	cos he
B	well they have the
D	oh right
B	and that's what I think
A	thank you very much
E	that's alright anytime sir
D	well I don't know sometimes
B	can you load the dishwasher please darlings?
B	so he's recently died?
D	well he has now you say it maybe his brother
E	well I seem to remember seeing him
B	no no no
