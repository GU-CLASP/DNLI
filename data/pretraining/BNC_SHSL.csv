B	do you reckon
A	he's not all there
B	how come he can do his job from Valencia?

A	or or whatever
B	blimey is that
A	no

A	I was going to swear then I won't but
A	well the thing is you know what easy come easy go
B	hmm
A	and it's normally people who are actually very very fucking cunning
B	uh hmm
A	who are able to do that
B	yeah
A	it's about training yourself I suppose to be able to to have that
A	oh shit
B	mind your language
A	language
B	true
A	language you know um
B	but it's not just slang it's uh expletive
A	expletives
B	slang
A	it is nonetheless
B	rude boy
A	that's very bad
B	you're a rude boy
A	that's very bad
B	so how's the family business going? Is are you pretty much?
A	it's good touch wood
B	are you pretty much taking over?
A	no
B	hmm
A	I've taken that's why I take two days off now a week
B	yeah
A	because it's just too much it's like every fucking
B	hmm
A	and living like that
B	uh hmm
A	then you
B	chaos
A	perhaps with the chaos it's like you will do what I say when I say it
B	is it your dad?
A	yeah
B	in control
A	that's your job and um and even though he
A	it is
B	I'm sure the project isn't going to be that
A	oh no no
B	and silliness and funnyness
A	I'm sure that I'm sure there'll be plenty of expletives
B	so
A	but we
B	so what are you going to do? Is it music?
A	we're gonna record um the oral histories of father grandfather fathers and sons
B	uh huh
A	compare them uh over pivotal
B	ah
A	pivotal religious social political points
B	oh wow
A	because there seems  there seems  to be a lot
B	uh hmm
A	uh people don't you know that closeness that our fathers had when they were uh you know kind of
B	fantastic
A	I hope that it's positive not you know kind of negative really
B	is
A	but he's
B	hmm
A	Cos he's
B	oh no yeah I bumped into
A	oh alright okay
B	I just get their names mixed up
A	oh right okay did you called him
B	no I didn't thankfully
B	I didn't say anything I said hi
A	oh alright
A	there are so many evil people
B	people
A	out there who manipulate funding in the system to do things that are essentially very you know  you know
B	uh hmm
A	itself or or or or a
B	oh it's like a little NGO?
A	similar to like an NGO
B	hmm
A	or the community
B	ooh
A	which is hmm yes which is  which is  which I think was was good
B	had the same letter in?
A	had the same letters in
B	ah cunning way to choose a name
A	initially we were going to call ourselves TFMD which is
A	yeah
B	philanthropy
A	yes
A	so um
B	so what would be the end objective to I mean cos I imagine you do the research and that
A	yeah
B	but then what would you do with it when you've compiled it all and?
A	hmm
B	hmm
A	um we'll be putting all of our findings online as a kind of online archive
B	hmm
A	we will then look to probably get our stuff put into archive at
B	oh cool
A	uh we'll be doing a number of video diaries you know just to kind of in terms of um
B	uh hmm
B	uh hmm
A	going through the you know underwear drawers
B	and how are you going to source the the participants?
A	well we're looking to source
B	uh hmm
A	with a number and that people can contact
B	hmm
A	to be able to I think show effective what the project is set out to do
B	I'm sure they would be
A	yeah
B	don't they?
A	yeah
B	hmm
A	hopefully it will be a good  a good  one
B	sounds very interesting
A	hopefully it will be a good one
B	yeah
B	but that's
A	and it's just ridiculous
B	I know it seems to be that that's all a lot of British people do for for their leisure time is let's go to the pub and I just get so bored of just going to the bloody pub
A	I
B	ding dong ding dong
A	in
B	in
A	yeah babe
B	that will be fun fun fun
A	yeah
B	Cos once you're in a pub it's it's not normal to drink something that's non alcoholic either is it?
A	but I've also seen the
B	yeah
A	when it gets to the evening and you know like at some point in the evening like I've had it here a couple of times where like a mate of a mate has come over and is just talking utter fucking drivel and because everyone is just a bit too civil they'll just go oh that's the end of the night  the end of the night  is gonna be me listening to this cock and I'm not gonna be able to do anything about it
A	well which is  which is  fine
B	oh
A	yeah she said yeah yeah
B	that's right
A	and I was
B	it's not right but I remember you saying
A	and I was  and I was  just like uh we've known each other for ages and and I just maybe I don't really know you you know and my my brother is his son's godfather
B	but was it actually that much of a contentious
A	well yeah it was cos
B	statement?
A	yeah because it kinda well because of the fact that we were actually where it led from was Empire and we started
B	oh okay
A	then we started talking about racism and what he tried and did was to try and shift the subject of the conversation to being you know kind of something that
B	genealogical?
B	let's make up a new word
A	let's make it up
B	yes there are the fair few dribblers
A	yeah
B	straggling down the high street at half past eleven in Moseley
A	it's like that comedian Richard Herring said once in this video he's getting heckled by someone
B	pause for thought
A	pause pause for thought
B	oh what's that?
A	what's that? Oh who's that? It's
B	oh it's all happening
A	just some leaflet twat
B	is that a nugget of
A	it's a nugget of
B	beeb gossip?
A	mm
A	fucking
B	stop it
A	that's that's what porn is
B	stop it
B	actually maybe they'll they'll appreciate a bit of comic relief
A	I'm sure they would
B	actually I don't know if it's a computer program listening
A	comic relief
B	oh stop it
A	sorry
B	so how's your finger?
A	it's
B	I see you've been itching it that means it's healing
A	it is
B	oh
A	I mean bloody hell
A	actually it should be today
B	have you taken that off? And
A	oh no I've replaced it like every day
B	uh-huh
A	replaced it yesterday so
B	is it scabbing over quite well?
A	there's no scabs on it
B	really?
A	no
B	but can you see that the two sides of the cut have fused?
A	yeah
B	oh
A	so it could be worth taking it to the nurse nursey nurse
B	how many stitches were there?
A	five? Six? Not that many
B	mm
A	it's such an idiotic injury
A	the thing is I've bumped into like two or three friends who've got exactly the same injuries
B	ow
A	so yeah you gotta be
B	washing up
A	well the boys at Kung Fu were taking the piss at me yesterday
A	God
B	cafe coffee cup
A	I should call them
B	that's a bit they're making their glasses a bit delicate
A	very aggressive washing
B	were you washing that man right out of your cups?
A	completely
B	I think
A	not
B	I think it might be time if you gonna
A	it might be time
B	if you're gonna slash yourself
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	time for healing
A	mm
B	and I saw a spider on my leg and I had secateurs on my hand and I went to get the spider away and I slashed my leg
A	how deep was that?
B	twenty stitches
A	yeah
A	oh my god
B	how deep was it? Em
B	em
A	person listening
B	it it kind of I don't know
A	must have been deep to get stitches
B	went into like an elliptical shape
A	oh shit
B	and I could see the flesh the the fatty you know you can see all the different layers of skin and
A	okay
A	oh man
B	it didn't bleed too badly actually
A	did you keep bleeding?
B	from two sides
A	did you keep bleeding? Keep keep bleeding  Did you keep bleeding?  Did you keep bleeding?
B	in the haemophiliac ward
A	anyway
B	yeah
A	there's not much there
B	urgh
A	the whole fucking just all of that was just covered cos I was I'd stupidly invited the one of the ginger knobs in one of the I've got a pair of ginger knobs outside that I don't know their names I just call them the ginger knobs
A	Cos it I had a few drops of blood on the tail
B	really?
A	Cos it was just there meowing for food while I was washing
B	he wasn't he was laughing at you
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	and kept doing it
B	there is that just kind of suspended moment of reality where you just in disbelief completely yeah oh no I'll just pop it back together
A	and I just ended up
B	I'm not trained?
A	I'm not trained to do that or something like that and I was like oh right
B	that's slightly worrying
A	isn't it?
B	that your doctor isn't trained to perform a bit of first aid?
A	and then got to Queen Elizabeth and almost got clamped
B	that's just adding insult to injury
A	I was like sorry mate you're gonna have to uh you're gonna have to move your car
B	aw
A	but uh yeah
B	A bit of shrapnel from the war
