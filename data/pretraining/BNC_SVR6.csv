B	Dartford Bridge
A	is such a nightmare
B	such a nightmare
A	it is so difficult to get through

B	oh good
A	on the way back however they shut Dartford er Tunnel
B	mm
A	what bit do you er yeah you it's the Dartford Tunnel they shut

B	mm
A	I don't really wanna go into Essex
B	mm

B	yeah
A	when you pulled off you had like the options for
B	mm
A	um
B	okay
A	to continue to the Dartford Tunnel
B	yeah
A	but that entrance was blocked off as well by like police vehicles
B	really?
A	slip road
B	that is a really good tip
A	because otherwise you'll end up following all the crowd into Essex
B	yeah
A	you don't know how you're gonna get out again
B	that's my concern
A	yeah
B	you're on your own
A	yeah yeah

A	okay
B	and so that can be on the table
A	who is he?
B	er off the table
A	from POF?
B	has er popped up

A	okay
B	so weird
A	okay
B	he's got ADHD
A	post
B	yeah
A	okay
B	no
A	right
B	whereas with him if you just asked him a question it was he was very up front about stuff
A	okay
B	rat basically
A	yep
B	um so he can charge quite a lot of money
A	oh okay
B	but he's also a screenwriter
A	ah
B	he also works for the
A	oh
B	so he's quite an interesting character
A	yes
B	like all this stuff comes
A	yeah
B	out
A	yeah
B	that you would never expect
A	okay
B	you know I just thought well he's obviously really interested in like current affairs and politics
A	yeah
B	all the stuff that you would never imagine
A	yeah
B	and he's got ADHD
A	so does he live by himself now then?
B	lives by himself

A	okay
B	Cos he's got a girlfriend
A	okay
B	but he basically does live there
A	oh
B	walkable
A	okay
B	so um yeah
A	is ADHD just sort of like too much energy?
B	yeah
A	right
B	told me this quite hilarious story where he tried to make hot cross buns
A	yeah
B	eight times
A	right
B	and then burn them
A	okay
B	after the first time you would pay attention
A	yeah
B	no
A	okay
B	until he actually sat there and watched it
A	oh
B	just keep swimming
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	but then he's been round the house a few times which is why obviously
A	yeah
B	and I didn't hear from him

A	oh no
B	no word
A	huh
B	so um I sent a message saying well I'm gonna eat dinner now cos I'm really hungry
A	yeah
B	and then er it really really messed with his head
A	oh my God
B	I know
A	yeah
B	wonder what's happened to you
A	regarding?
B	he'd stayed over on the Wednesday night
A	oh
B	so that kept me awake all night
A	yeah
B	and then in the morning when he finally had got to sleep I had to get up
A	why did he say that?
B	was rude
A	Cos he was just like wanting to sleep?
B	well he told me later that it was because he was er he'd forgotten his inhaler
A	yeah
B	then we said we'd see each other on last Sunday
A	last week er last weekend?

B	shorter than me
A	right it's going nowhere
A	POF profile you need to

B	but the thing is because er I'd like to move to Europe but the the but Europe's fucked financially
A	what's she doing there?
B	she's gonna go for a year
A	wait when?
B	this was all my plan
A	she's nicked your plan?
B	she's nicked my plan
A	what about her?
B	she's had a um a total nightmare living with her mum
A	what mean? She's mean?
B	she's mean
A	yeah yeah
B	it makes me really appreciate that when I was at home
A	yeah
B	mum never gave me grief really
A	no
B	yeah
A	yeah well she er well er poison pie
B	poison pie
A	but pie nonetheless
B	mm
A	and she does it for me every night
B	oh
B	and she wallpapered the Toblerone room
A	she wallpapered the Toblerone room
B	mm
B	all er she's made you
A	okay
B	verging on alcoholism
A	okay
B	came home absolutely smashed and er
A	oh my God
B	um
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	she just says she gets total grief
A	so er she's given up her sort of teaching the children job?
B	well the thing is all of her contracts have always been for one year
A	okay
B	but this one has been maternity cover
A	right
B	the next half-term
B	so she's only got seven weeks left
A	so and then she's booked to go to Australia for one year?
B	er well no she's booked for like
A	one way flight?
B	no
A	er
B	the immigration prefer it if you do
A	okay
B	and you can change it
A	oh okay
B	so she's flying with Qantas
A	where's she going?
B	subcontract
A	Sydney? Melbourne?
B	Brisbane of all places
A	okay
B	she said she went to er STA travel and they talked her into it
A	Good luck with that
B	but
A	and isn't she going in like their winter as well?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	so even if she went later in the year she would've had to get a part-time job for the summer
A	yep
B	so you might as well just go
A	okay
B	so that's what's her thinking between behind Brisbane was it was north so it's warmer
A	is she going on her own?
B	yeah
B	Don't have any money
A	do you not have any money?
B	no
A	yay
B	car booty
A	you could probably make about twenty pounds
A	really?
B	I'd spend more money than I actually made
A	you're like
B	mm
A	and um mum was supposed to be doing it with
B	mm
A	and then er she said to
B	oh God
A	got in at half past five
A	mum goes up to his room at seven o'clock and all I hear is shut the fuck up
B	Jesus
A	I know
B	he was still pissed
A	and so mum was like er I knew that she'd be really disappointed
B	mm
A	so I was like fuck's sake
B	oh
A	get out of bed at like
B	so you did it
A	seven thirty
B	oh
A	and I go through to the bathroom
B	oh
A	and I was like um go back to bed
B	oh
A	I get dressed like dead quick
A	but at this stage in the game I was like well I'm dressed and ready now
B	mm
A	so I followed them in my little smart car
B	oh okay
A	and then at nine o'clock they let you in to get to your pitch
B	oh
A	sets up at the same time
B	oh I see
A	yeah you can't
B	you can't just set up
A	no
B	oh my God
A	anyway so mum had a right mixture of stuff
A	which she let go for two pounds
B	oh no
A	now if we'd done our research on eBay
B	yeah
A	we would've known
B	mm
A	they go for anywhere between sort of twelve and thirty
B	mm
A	and er as
A	it's gone now
B	aw
A	but then she did sell a keyboard for thirty-five
A	that he painted me for like some
B	oh
A	anniversary that is shit and rank
A	amateurish and retarded
A	she kept it in the loft
A	for over ten years
A	she always thought it was he was gonna like make it
B	aw
A	and um anyway
B	mm
A	and he was saying someone said to me that you can't take anything to a boot sale um if you would be upset that it got nicked
B	yeah
A	and he told me a really funny story
A	then she goes will you take forty-seven P? Right?
B	no way
A	and he was like I would love to but I just can't get let it go for less than fifty P
B	for three P?
A	yeah
B	Jesus Christ
A	yeah
B	is it really that bad?
A	yeah
B	fuck me
A	and I'd heard about dodgy twenty pound notes
B	mm
A	so when we had like a rail of some clothes
B	mm
A	like old boys' clothes
B	huh? The gypo again
A	and um she picked up three shirts
B	mm
A	she handed me a twenty pound note
B	oh
A	and I held it up and looked at it
B	on the ball
A	on the button with it all
B	yeah
A	she left it all and everything
B	suspicious
A	but cos everything was just pound and fifty Ps apart from the keyboard and the pictures
B	mm
A	I think that was okay
B	oh have you? That's a good idea
A	yeah
A	I haven't made any money on it
B	mm
A	I've let go for ninety-nine P
B	nice
A	so like three pound a dress
B	mm
A	right? And it was nine ninety-nine
B	yeah
B	no way
A	so I was like I'll have a piece of this
B	yeah
A	anyway so I wore it that er Saturday night
B	mm
A	but it was very low-cut at the front
B	mm
A	and I don't er
B	no
A	so I kind of like I
B	mm
A	so I put it on eBay
B	yeah
A	I'm not gonna do stupid crazy sixty-five pounds
B	has that woman got any bids on hers?
A	no
B	oh
A	but she's relisted it  relisted it  for sixty-eight
B	oh
A	but I put mine on at eighteen pound auction
B	oh okay
A	so hopefully it might go
B	mm
A	and I can make a cheeky eight pound profit
B	oh well that'd be nice
A	so my new thing is going to like there's one charity shop in town that doesn't take Primark or New Look shit
B	Good stuff
A	quality stuff
B	nice
A	Juliet? oh my God
B	oh and
A	Juliet
B	mm
A	she's just popped on with William to do something
B	mm
A	all good condition and everything
B	huh
A	because she's got the eye now for
B	yeah
A	her range is little kiddy stuff
B	mm
A	so she knows the value of everything
B	mm
A	so she literally
B	she knows her market
A	flipped it within ten minutes and made twenty pounds
B	nice
A	it was so funny
B	sort of Wendy houses and stuff?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	little Cozy Coupe cars and she's got a er industrial unit and she's got it all in there
B	oh my God
A	so people
B	so she's doing really well then
A	come along and they're like oh yeah I've come to pick up this slide
B	mm
A	and then she's got all this other shit there
B	oh God
A	for like yeah so she's doing good on that
B	mm
A	she's doing well on that
B	that's quite exciting
A	well
B	buying and selling
A	he just buys
B	mister Trebus
A	he is Mister Trebus
B	er but he was doing that wasn't he? He was making quite a nice little profit before
B	mm
A	he's got more of an incentive to make cos he's doing cold calling basically
B	mm
A	and they were like that
B	yeah
A	but they're like in this current job climate blah blah
B	it's showing initiative isn't it
A	I know
A	I was like that
B	but I've got cancer
A	let's all move to bloody
A	Barbados
B	oh huh
A	isn't it a bit mad to go with no nothing lined up or not?
B	my concern er obviously cos she's got on her skills list you know that they allow you in more readily
A	yeah
B	if you've got a skill that they're looking for
A	has she got any of the skills?
B	teaching is
A	oh is it?
A	oh that's interesting
B	on the skills list
A	I suppose it's primary school
B	really know
A	it's a bit more
B	well they um
A	flexible
B	with her visa they said are you gonna be teaching for longer than three months? And if so give us all your health records
A	yeah
B	what your outgoings
A	yeah
B	Brisbane
A	okay
B	east coast
A	yeah
B	you can go to like the er northern territories and that's but that's really like real yokel
A	okay
B	area
A	yeah
B	it's a bit scary rah
A	okay
B	and I guess that's probably
A	yeah
B	and then fly from there to huh New Zealand
A	or just go on a tour
B	for a few weeks or something
A	yeah
B	well that's what
A	yes
B	so
A	yeah
B	didn't she get like
A	yeah
B	have you not spoken to her since we?
A	no she sent me a really narky um thing
B	the last time I spoke to you about it was in
A	yeah
B	then she was being a bit off with you
A	yeah
B	there was that e-mail
A	I was like fine I'll leave it
B	yeah
A	fair enough
B	mm
A	I'm moving to
B	from

A	and just got a text message back going this isn't my address anymore
B	mm
A	she wrote back and she went okay well enjoy your Sunday
B	she didn't give you her address?
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	yeah
A	and er she and she wouldn't give me her address
B	why would she go to the effort of writing to you and say this isn't my address?
A	yeah
B	because she clearly got the card
A	yeah
B	because she wouldn't know that you'd sent it
A	I know
B	mm
A	I think er I just don't think we have that much in common anymore
B	mm well no
A	yeah
B	haven't you
A	yeah
B	but that doesn't mean that you know if a few years time you might've come
A	yeah
B	and maybe you'll come back like that
A	who knows
B	but it's a bit of a shame that she's acted like that
A	yeah
B	huh
A	I mean to be honest probably objectively speaking she's not done anything wrong
B	well the last thing you need at the moment is any more drama
B	hard work so
A	yeah
B	A
A	yeah
B	was it
A	it was
B	yeah
A	and then um but because of this drama that happened previous

A	no? Does it pay well then?
D	no
A	at least
D	no
A	oh God
D	it's a stupid idea
A	what are the perks? Are the perks the getting the hotel in Ireland for eighteen pound a night?
D	yeah
A	yeah

A	yeah
D	and then an interview
A	yeah
D	and then if it all goes to plan
A	yeah
D	September
A	for a start date

D	I know
B	prowess
D	it's a three-day interview as well
B	of physical prowess
A	what interview? Sorry?
D	three-day interview
A	like an
B	but the actual face-to-face interview is then as well isn't it?
D	yeah
B	you'd think they'd do that first
D	with four people
B	Cos if you turn out to be fucking mental
D	yeah
B	you've put yourself through all of that training
D	well they probably hope that the mentalists drop out
B	yeah
A	they might be really strong fit mentalists though
B	maybe that's
D	yeah
B	what they want actually
A	machines
B	mm
D	Cannon fodder they'll just say no
A	so what exactly do
D	yep
A	ah
D	than let's go to war

A	out on the lash or
D	Seven star hotels in Bahrain
A	sunning it up
D	yep
A	yeah
D	yeah
A	like that kind of thing
B	what?

A	yeah
B	is that so that's paid for by the taxpayer presumably?
D	yeah
A	that's what your little taxes are paying for
B	what the fuck?
D	yeah
A	that was quick
B	does that look done er enough to you?
A	yeah it does actually
B	I don't think you'd want it in longer than that

D	well that's the alternative
A	yeah
D	um I'm gonna be too old to apply as an officer
A	yeah
D	yeah
D	and they said well basically if you're in the top three percent of applicants we'll try and apply for an age waiver
A	oh
D	the stupid ten days that I'm too old by
A	oh my God
D	it's crap
B	Cos you'll have done everything else while you're twenty-five won't you

B	it's
D	yeah
B	is that the idea?
A	if it
D	mm

D	is that what you were gonna say?
A	and like my Italian wasn't very good
D	oh yeah
A	mean and evil
B	the guy
A	yeah
B	um that phrase that he used to shout at people
A	oh
B	yeah yeah
A	like pig whore
B	the worst thing you could ever say
A	he used to scream it across the office
A	he was the like head er head solicitor
B	wasn't it that the girls wouldn't tell you what it meant cos they were so horrified by it?
D	it's like we'd say mother fucker
B	virgin Mary fucker
D	yeah
A	I think my mum had to tell me what it meant
A	maybe she
B	I suppose everyone knows the C word
A	huh
B	polite society would say it
D	yeah it's as bad as the C word  it's as bad as the C word
B	so your mum would know it
A	he used to scream it across the office
A	or he'd be like what have you done? In Italian
B	disgraceful
A	fine
B	they can't have people like that
D	no
A	no? Okay
B	bloody hell
A	what for?
D	I know
A	what was the reasoning behind this?
D	stupid dieting
B	you are being so hardcore
A	er like er
D	I know
A	do you have to is there like certain criteria for your like navy intake? Like weight or height or eyesight or fitness
D	no
A	level?
D	you have to I've had my eyes done
A	yeah
D	my eyes tested
A	mm
D	um
A	is that  is that  hard?
B	it's fucking hard
A	okay
D	I'm at fifteen and a half now
B	mm
D	still not what it was like before my leg got hit
B	mm
A	mm
D	um
A	okay
D	but my cos your BMI's supposed to be like maximum of twenty-five
A	oh
D	but um she said when you go there like they're a doctor
B	mhm
D	big bangers
A	yeah
D	so
B	Cos that's the thing
D	yeah
B	er like and if you're  if you're  really muscly that you'll weigh more won't you
D	yeah
B	in theory they've gotta actually take quite a lot of factors into consideration surely?
D	mm
B	mm
A	God
D	my thighs are fucking killing though after this week
B	mm
A	it just illustrates your commitment
D	mm
A	it must be really hard
B	it's impressive that you're doing it
D	yeah it's a bit of a
A	yeah
D	it's a bit of a mick take
B	mm
A	mm
B	it's just er bad timing with the Easter weekend
D	mm
A	alcohol's got a lot of calories in it though
D	yep
A	do you drink  do you drink  much?
D	did drink
A	okay
D	yes
A	okay
D	now not
A	Good
D	secret calorie
A	yeah
B	mm
D	buggers
B	mm
A	well good luck with it all
D	thanks
A	it'd be so amazing if you got it
B	mm
D	mm
A	but if you get so close and then not get it you
B	mm
A	just go out on an absolute bender and just completely
B	well especially
D	yeah
B	if it's a physical thing that's letting you down
D	yeah
B	as opposed to being mentally prepared and
D	yeah
B	able to do it
D	if I fail because I go to the interview and they're like no you're just not cut out to do it
A	yeah
D	you're not the right candidate then
B	mm
D	fair enough
B	mm
D	but if I go there and it's because of this fucking leg I'm gonna be so pissed
B	mhm
A	but the thing is though
A	they should consider that once you get into it you will be um you know um taking part in their like regime
B	mm
A	so you
D	yeah
A	physically wouldn't be able to you know be overweight
D	yeah
A	in your day-to-day work
B	mhm
A	I assume that they're gonna be keeping you
D	yeah
A	doing stuff so
B	and they're gonna have actual you know proper properly trained people to help you
D	yeah
B	you know maintain your fitness
D	they say when you get there to do the fitness test for three days after I do the
A	yeah
D	you need to show that you're kind of well-motivated to push yourself as hard as you possibly can
B	mm
D	it's more like an attitude thing I suppose
A	yeah
D	so there'll be no ah I'm dying
B	mm
unknown_female	right
D	bye
B	see you
A	bye
D	yeah
A	I think they should test you on that rather than your actual level now
D	yeah yeah
B	mm
D	they put you under they have like er a group thing
A	oh my God
D	then they give you a different problem then you have to er lead the group to work it out
B	shitting hell
D	more fucking maths tests
B	that's just rude
A	what you've got in your favour is that you're female I reckon
D	mm
A	really?
D	yeah
B	oh
D	the only thing you get leeway with is there's one some massive missile something or other that you have to lift that's some ridiculous kilogram-ness
B	fuck me
A	have you always wanted to do this? Or did it come to you sort of randomly in a dream?
B	she came back from Christmas and was like right I'm joining The Navy
A	really? Oh right
B	mm
D	yes
B	yeah
A	oh
B	I like swimming
D	I like shoes
B	yeah
D	no my cousin's in The Navy
A	mm
B	I think that's it
B	or friends who've been in the forces it does sort of put the idea in your head
D	mm
B	well that's a viable career option
D	yeah I think if he hadn't I would never considered it
B	and did he
B	did he go to uni? Or he went straight into The Navy?
D	straight into The Navy
B	mm
D	probably when he was huh about seventeen until about twenty-one twenty-two
B	did he have a job?
B	mhm
B	mhm
D	then came back and joined The Navy
A	no
D	yeah
D	um
D	um and he was like oh yeah I'm in a seven star hotel in Bahrain
D	just rub it in
A	is it  is it
B	mm
A	ranks of
D	yeah
A	seventeen? Well like maybe eighteen
D	seventeen year olds
A	nineteen year olds
B	mm
D	yeah
A	there's no middle ground?
D	no
A	isn't that interesting
D	it's weird isn't it
A	yeah
D	I don't really get it
A	it's quite unique to have that
D	there's one above like cos to do the job that I want to do you don't need a degree
A	mm
D	so the entry's the same
A	yeah
D	higher than these people who just got A-levels
A	okay
D	but everyone enters at the same level
B	mm
D	but then they don't split
B	mm
D	entry level
A	that's it yes
D	and then it's up to you
B	fuck
B	in the officers
D	yep
B	and some of them have worked just in hospitality?
D	yeah
B	so they could go in and like cook dinner?
D	you wouldn't get  you wouldn't get  a chef going in as an officer
B	oh really?
D	you might get um
B	but they're more like the
D	yeah
B	sure that all the food's been ordered and
B	mm
D	and the people who make sure stuff's posted right
B	mm
D	and the stuff people that ship the missiles
B	ship the missiles
D	and the accountants
B	mm
D	so people who are chefs or something that's not you wouldn't require a degree for
