B	week after no he hasn't done much
A	is he doing anything on sociology?
B	I don't really know to be honest
A	I think he does do some work
B	he looks like he's working
A	what do you think about him wanting to be a fireman?
A	sorry
B	he just knows
A	well you say that
B	yeah I know I know but it
A	it was competitive in our day
B	do you know I don't think it was as competitive
A	yeah I do
B	well
A	I didn't get into any university did I?
B	did you try?
A	yes
B	oh did you?
A	yeah
B	well
A	I didn't get A levels no
B	no
A	so you you're talking about somebody
B	mm?
A	I've got one
B	did you?
A	yeah thanks for that
A	it's not it's not about
B	mm
A	communicate
B	I think
A	and he he can
B	he's better he's better
A	he can communicate
B	he can communicate
A	when I was his age
B	he's got an answer for everything he's quick witted and I think he will do fine but it's just
A	not if he goes in to try and be a fireman he won't
B	no no no he won't
A	it's not about
B	he's not empathetic
A	I think he is I think he is quite empathetic I think he's really objective at times actually
B	do you?
A	yeah
B	so what would you
A	I think he needs to go I I don't think he unfortunately I think he needs to go into some sort of management role
B	but how how how?
A	he needs to choose a field
B	yeah I
A	he's not gonna go into an area where you
B	such as?
A	er if you're looking at banking
B	no the accountants have to get qualifications they have to take their accountancy exams
A	I'd think he's not going to be able to do that
B	no
A	because he hasn't got
B	mm?
A	I think he could do that and I think he could manage people
B	yeah probably but how do you get him into that?
B	well
A	no drop him with
B	leave him there?
B	when?
A	I'd ask
B	well why couldn't you go up there?
A	he doesn't
B	per week?
A	he doesn't know
B	well
A	has he told you that?
B	er no but
A	does he does he know what he's gonna see?
B	no course he doesn't course he doesn't he's sixteen how would he know that?
A	really?
B	well
A	he hasn't done any of it
A	his whole life is gonna be
B	I don't know he doesn't appreciate that work's gonna be
B	no it's not
A	because he's gonna be a
B	mm
A	mornings
B	don't pull that face at me
A	no yeah you do need to to
B	but
A	I'd I'd hope he'd
A	show a bit more ambition
B	no he's not not on a fireman's salary absolutely not
A	yeah
B	maybe if he sees oh look as the manager of this place
A	I might have to brief
B	and maybe get
A	doesn't earn forty grand
B	doesn't don't they?
A	no
B	don't they?
A	a fireman?
B	I don't know
A	they might do
B	I don't know but
A	but not a starting one
B	no not a starting one but
A	does he? has he gone off the idea of doing an apprenticeship then?
B	he hasn't said so no
A	right they start on just over twenty-one a year
B	see and how old would you be when you're a station manager?
A	forty
B	it's not enough to live on is it?
A	I don't think so
B	no
A	does he?
B	I think so
B	one or the other
A	I'd rather
B	but you know if he if he could make a business out of it you know like you
A	yeah
B	do this we've got a LTA registered course it's this it's
A	yeah yeah
B	this competition
A	well er why does?
B	he's like really really wealthy from being a tennis
A	well why doesn't
B	I don't know
A	he could do go and do his work experience there
B	mm
C	er doing tennis
A	pardon?
C	didn't think you wanted
A	I'd rather he did that than
B	no one can understand you
A	I can
B	say it again
A	he said
B	we want him to do
A	you know?
C	ah
B	obviously
B	obviously
A	and I wanted to I my other ambition was always to have enough money that if I wanted to buy something I could go out and get it without having to worry about
B	for instance like a thirty grand car for your mum
A	that was top my
C	what his mum?
B	no
C	it didn't pull out today did it?
B	it didn't did it
C	we want a new car we do
C	don't want one of those
B	why didn't it pull out
A	why don't you take it to the garage then?
B	I don't know because it was a one-off
A	do you want me to take it to the garage?
B	no
A	do you want me to drive it
A	this weekend?
C	is it is it?
B	no yes drive it this weekend see what you think
C	this is like the
C	you could've died
B	no we couldn't've died but we did pull out of a really small gap
A	so yeah but those were those were my ambitions and and
B	and very rich
A	right
B	not gonna happen
A	now a fireman at the age of forty is likely to earn around forty thousand pounds
C	it's not a lot
B	no it's not a lot
A	no not really
C	how much do you earn?
B	doesn't matter
C	do you earn more than the average person?
