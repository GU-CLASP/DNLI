A	so I've got to go to this drama performance tomorrow
B	oh right what one's that
A	the er the tic-tac-toe one which I had to pay for this morning
B	oh I see
A	yeah
B	is? is that erm outside of the college?
A	no they're coming into the college to do it
B	right
A	yeah
B	ah what's it? what's? what's the tic-tac-toe? that's that's like the American version of noughts and crosses isn't it? tic-tac-toe
A	yeah it's just the name of the company
B	right
A	it's the the I can't remember I think the name of the play is called The Open Couple or something
B	oh okay
A	but yeah so that's that's going to be like an hour tomorrow and that's going to be in my massive free space which is a shame but anyway
A	mm
B	so as it's a massive free space so you'll probably still have time to do a
A	a bit yeah
B	a bit of extra work yeah
A	yeah I've got a couple of essays to write now
B	have you?
A	yeah
B	what about?
A	er I've got one on a room with a view and
B	mm hm
A	another English language one and a little other thing that I have to do for English language
B	ah it's all about the English language then this week is it?
A	yeah yeah
B	so when do they have to be in?
A	erm one of them has to be in on Thursday but the rest the don't have to be in till next week
B	right
A	but I want to get started on my English literature one cos it's going to be long
B	the the one about Room with a View?
A	it's like a thousand words yeah
B	well what's the premise of the essay then?
A	I've got to talk about the main character Lucy
B	oh right okay
A	yeah
B	didn't you do an essay on room with a view before?
A	no
B	what was the one you had to do in the holidays before you actually started the course?
A	oh yeah well that wasn't it was a little bit on the first chapter but it wasn't much of an essay
B	oh right just a little taster
A	yeah
B	yeah mm well you kind of enjoy all of that analysis stuff once you get into it don't you?
A	yeah yeah yeah yeah
B	I guess it's a
A	it'll just be a bit of a long slog
B	yeah yeah
A	but erm what was I going to say? oh yeah I got my erm my drama grades back for my induction tasks so I got erm Bs and Cs which is fine and
B	great
A	the the essay that I did I got a B in and she said that she had like she had no concerns about getting my written work up to an A and she said she thinks
B	terrific
A	we can get my cos obviously my target grade is an A
B	mm
A	she said that she thinks she
A	but erm yeah she was talking about a thing called to heightened naturalism which she thinks I'm suited to and which I think I'm suited to which is
A	it's a style of acting isn't worth explaining it
B	alright so what? naturalistic but sort of a bit caricature?
A	no
A	no not really cos caricature is the opposite of naturalism so
B	well I guess so yeah
A	yeah
B	that was a bit of a dichotomy there
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	you know
B	mm hm yeah
A	heightened naturalism you kind of take
B	mm
A	and you kind of instead of trying to portray a more a a character with loads of depth you take the kind of important bits of them and portray those naturalistically
B	right
A	and like the Rebecca that we went to see that was kind of heightened naturalism
B	ah okay
A	cos it it was kind of naturalistic in it in the way that it served the story and it was a naturalistic story and sort of it it wasn't always sort of oh pantomime or whatever obviously there were bits with like physical theatre and that which aren't naturalistic
B	yeah
A	but their voice and that wasn't unnaturalistic
B	mm hm
A	but it wasn't really naturalism cos it didn't really like feel empathy for the characters that make sense?
B	mm
A	it's it's yeah
B	no I'm just thinking further really and deeper I suppose just you know? thinking about most things that you see you know? be in in terms of a stage play or you know? a TV series or whatever aren't they all going for a naturalistic approach because they're trying to erm convey something naturally rather than you know
A	naturalism is the predominant style but you you probably in in TV it definitely is
B	yeah aha
A	but then you've got melodrama and things which you have on TV and you have comedy things which aren't done naturalistically cos it's overplayed and eh archetypal
B	yeah yeah
A	and then lots of theatre is non-naturalistic and there's lots of theatre styles that you probably don't see very often but they do exist and might have been bigger in their time
B	right okay
A	but yeah
B	in yeah I
A	no yeah no but do you remember me telling you about Berkoff?
B	yeah
A	yeah and that's like
B	mm mm
A	it's just yeah cos it's all about the way you in which you choose to portray a message and at the moment naturalism is how they normally do it probably cos it's the easiest as well
B	mm
A	yeah yeah but some of the other ones are more interesting erm yeah
B	mm
A	cos I had to write an essay comparing Stanislavsky who sort of erm created the most rigorous er acting system for naturalism and Berkoff who did total theatre which is all the very different one
B	mm
A	and I had to kind of cos Berkoff is trying to portray a message by just erm I can't explain it but by unseating you and and cos the thing with naturalism it's
B	yeah
A	it is the stuff you see everyday
B	yeah
A	whereas Berkoff is like so different from what you see
B	mm
A	but not necessarily then untrue
B	right
A	it's not untrue it's just
B	right mm
A	it can be more representative of within yourself
B	right
A	and how and like how
B	hm yeah
A	you can combine kind of the meaning of what you're saying
B	mm
A	not just through what you're saying but how you say it
B	mm
A	it like the tone and the pitch and all these other things
B	yeah yeah
A	and that because that's kind of unseating and is more within
B	yeah yeah
A	it it can portray a message even better sometimes
B	sure yeah I guess that's the thing as well thinking about it with with naturalism you know?
A	aha
B	it in I don't know whether Berkoff focuses on this or whether I'm completely off the mark but you know in order for me to be having this conversation with you in the in between bits I will have been thinking certain things
A	yeah
B	that you may never hear but they may be completely crazy and off the wall and
A	yeah
B	or I might be suppressing stuff that you don't actually get to hear or or see
A	yeah
B	mm
A	cos there's other styles and there's another type of theatre I think it's Brecht
B	oh yeah that name rings a bell yeah
A	oh really? erm and that is all about erm highlighting the
B	oh okay
A	and er the lighting will just be harsh and brighten up into
B	mm
A	scene changes will happen with like full lighting on
B	so more revealing of the inner? yeah
A	yeah
B	mm mm
A	and sort of showing you that it's all an illusion which is another interesting one
B	got you yeah yeah
A	mm
B	oh so that's Brecht is it?
A	yeah Brecht
B	mm
A	I want to say that that's total theatre but it's not
B	mm mm anyway i've forgotten how we got here oh yes about your drama teacher saying that you're more suited erm
A	to heightened naturalism
B	right okay
A	which is good
B	right
A	to sort of get better group dynamics or whatever or make sure people who are going to be working in a certain way are all kind of together
B	oh okay
A	so they're doing that a bit even though there's quite like there's quite a few people in our class who don't like doing naturalism
B	mm
A	like there's a few girls who like playing the comedy parts and like the men and that
B	right
A	er yeah and do all that
A	yeah cos like
B	Victorian mould as well
A	just just er in in a more comedy way they like to play characters that are completely removed from themselves
B	oh okay yeah
A	sort of thing
B	yeah
A	erm
B	right
A	cos it's just cos it's separate from yourself I guess
B	mm
A	you don't feel
B	mm
A	like you're putting yourself out there too much I don't mind I don't care
B	right yeah
A	oh the other thing was erm there's they're going to have a poetry by heart competition at the college where you have to recite one or two poems
B	mm
A	erm in mid-November from this list I need to look it up and then they choose one winner to go on to perform at like a I don't know whether it's a regional or national competition then
B	mm
A	which is cool so I'm going to do that
B	oh great
A	but I need to get in contact with my teacher but I just thought of that that's another performance thing
B	performance thing? sorry I must have missed
A	reciting poetry
B	oh the recital aspect right
A	yeah
B	ah great oh well
A	and you know? you've got to do it from memory
B	yeah well you love that aspect of it don't you?
A	yeah
B	the performance side
A	oh yeah
B	yeah
A	mm
B	oh that'll be good
A	yeah it will
B	is there much opportunity in in your class at the moment for within the course framework for poetry?
A	which? which course?
B	erm English literature
A	we do a whole unit on poetry
B	so
A	we're doing Ted Hughes yeah
B	right okay
A	you don't you don't write you don't write
B	you don't write? that's kind of what I meant really you know you're
A	yeah you
B	is that all in the language
A	you just commentate on things
B	right
A	just yeah it's not even that much in language I think there might be one bit in there
B	really? yeah
A	of coursework in the second year and then you have to do a commentary of your own work
A	yeah you've got to do ah I don't know if it's a a descriptive piece of writing or something and then you have to commentate on your own choices of language in your own work
B	mm
A	which sounds horrible
A	but no
B	mm hm mm so in your free time you might do a bit of ah of poetry a of a writing then
A	yeah there's a creative writing enrichment but I can't go to it cos it's when my drama my drama enrichment yeah
A	I know only one person goes to it at the moment
B	oh goodness me
A	yeah I was like ah that's sad
B	oh maybe they have to run another you know? another time day for it
A	no they won't cos
B	oh are they?
A	yeah
B	right mm
A	yeah might be able to next year
B	so what have you got? what have you got going on with enrichments?
A	I have to do drama enrichment
B	that is it's just that
A	that's ah yeah I have to it's compulsory if I'm doing drama I have to do drama enrichment because it's such a practical course
B	mm
A	and it's harder for you you know you've got to do your hours of independent study in each subject a week?
B	yeah
A	well those two hours count as two hours of drama independent study and it means that we can do our practical then
B	ah right yeah cos otherwise that could get tricky couldn't it? mm mm
A	yeah
B	but how about the gifted and talented erm
A	I don't know that there is a gifted and talented thing apart from
B	no no I did just mean any gifted and talented start
A	I think it's just
B	is it? yeah
A	from when I've looked at their website it's just really
B	mm but you're also looking at other enrichments as well weren't you? you weren't just looking well I know you you're having to do drama but you were looking at what their enrichment program was so
A	yeah and they were all at the same time
B	is there no way out of that?
A	no
B	I thought you got you know? choice
A	you can do more than one but they have to be at different times
B	and and there aren't any on at different times?
A	well there are some but none that I'm interested in to be honest
B	oh okay there we are
A	yeah
B	mm
A	or
B	mm lovely
A	yeah
B	that's a shame but there we go
A	mm
