A	so what are you doing this weekend?
B	er this weekend I'm doing nothing much and it's really nice cos I've had
A	oh
B	for the last sort of five or six weeks I've had something every single weekend
A	oh right
B	so I'm really looking forward to not doing sort of anything
A	just chilling out
B	just
A	right
B	erm I I went to
A	to where to where?
A	oh right
B	I went to see the book town in
A	no I'm going there
B	oh it's really good
A	in er next month
B	it's really really good
A	oh right
B	erm so the first couple of days was really sunny so we were walking
A	yeah
B	but we did some canoeing and I thought we've got two days left when we and we spent two days just in the bookshops
A	er but it's it's not during the festival?
B	I didn't go to the festival it's it's
A	no
B	really good anyway
A	even even any time
B	yeah
A	oh that's great okay
B	really really good and I got seven books
A	yeah it's just full of bookshops?
B	full of bookshops and some of them are kind of special interest ones so there's more of the like crime and fiction and I think there's children's fiction ones and some of them are just massive massive buildings with a load of secondhand books
A	wow
B	it was really good
A	how fantastic er well I'm really looking forward to it and and we're we're going to we've got a ticket to the Rugby World Cup
B	oh okay
A	in
B	nice
A	and er the idea is to go first of all to
B	yeah I wondered if it was actually nicer because apparently during the festival the normal population is about ten thousand and it goes to something like a hundred thousand during the festival
A	right
B	so I think it's difficult to actually get
A	yeah yeah
B	whereas when we went it you know it was still summer holidays
A	yeah
A	yeah and easier to get accommodation and things like that
B	yeah we had a lovely cottage and
A	yeah
B	we went camping in a field and it just
A	oh right
B	it was all
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	very pleasant and a really nice
A	oh excellent
B	way to spending a few days
A	and I I think I've once been near the kind of
B	right
A	but I don't really know it at all
B	yeah I'd never been before erm I think I must have driven past it at various points erm
A	yeah yeah oh well that's great
B	yeah yeah
A	that's good to hear
B	really
A	so you're reading through all the books now then?
B	well yeah I'm trying to read through the books and I'm I was making really good headway and then yesterday I bought three more
A	yeah
B	er where the authors are signing
A	okay
B	I've I've got to get
A	and you and you always read printed books you don't read er ebooks
B	I've got a Kindle
A	yeah
B	I really like it and I I'm not like a sort of massive opponent of ebooks but
A	yeah
B	I still like printed books
A	yeah yeah
B	erm I think you know about going on holiday I'll take a book and I think oh but what if I finish this
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	oh but what if I I don't want to really leave it
A	yeah yeah
B	so I think if I take like a book and a Kindle that
A	yes
B	sort of covers
A	yeah yeah that's true
A	that's true
B	that seems to work quite well for me
A	I've found the only problem is well I don't read off a Kindle I read off an Ipad and I can I get easily distracted so if there's something in the book and I'm thinking I wonder if that's true or if that really
B	yeah
A	happened and then I then I find myself
B	that's why I think a Kindle works quite well
A	yeah
B	that you can't really use it for anything other than
A	yeah
B	reading books
A	yeah yeah
B	it's like it's kind of easy to get distracted on to another book
A	yeah
B	but there's no yeah you can't
A	you can't start
A	yeah yeah yeah and it's lighter isn't it?
B	yeah yeah it is
A	yeah yeah
B	and it's sort of the screen is really nice
A	yeah
B	like I wasn't sure about reading on on a Kindle
A	no
B	it's a quite a small screen but it it's really nice and I think an Ipad even if they managed to sort of dim it it's still shiny when you
A	it is yeah yeah yeah
B	a Kindle actually feels sort of a bit like a book and it's
A	yeah yeah well I was reading it on a beach a couple of weeks ago and I thought this is crazy cos it's
B	yeah
A	it was very difficult
B	mm
A	but the nice thing you know I was reading erm Shogun
B	oh right
A	recently you know I don't know if you know
B	right
A	and so to be able it's got some feature where you can just highlight a word and then it brings up every or a name it brings up every previous mention
B	ah
A	of that name
B	oh that's good
A	and so you can just kind of click through and work out what they what they had done already and who they were
B	that's really useful yeah
A	so I've got brilliant brilliant
B	I've just read erm a Hundred Years of Solitude
A	oh right
B	and that is a similar thing
A	yeah
B	and it's really complicated and you've got all the characters have the same name as well because every generation the
B	so it's an absolute nightmare trying to work out
A	yeah
B	and there's like a family tree in the front so I was kind of flicking
A	yeah yeah
B	back to that and I'm glad I read it in print just to
A	yes
B	to be able to turn back so easily but
A	yeah
B	yeah you find yourself having to write you know
A	yes
B	or the one with the
A	well well that's what I when I first started reading erm on my Ipad that's what I thought the problem was going to be was that normally I find myself writing things on the inside cover
B	oh okay
A	who the different people are and what their relationship is and so it's it's difficult to do but
B	yeah
A	when I discovered this feature I thought that oh well it's it's better in some ways
B	yeah that is really cool
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	so
B	oh that's good
A	erm on Sunday yeah so I'm looking forward to that that'll be er sort of we're busy cooking lots of food and cakes and things like that
B	he wouldn't
A	no no no no that's right they don't
B	yeah that's true yeah
A	so
B	mm
A	yeah
B	so is he back kind of
A	back permanently yeah yeah it was a six-month erm
B	yeah
A	secondment and er he's back and gonna move back to
B	brilliant has he enjoyed it?
A	he's loved it and and he's really extracted every minute of er er every possible thing he could have and every weekend he was travelling doing things so erm you know he he doesn't feel like he's missed opportunities
B	that's brilliant
A	yeah yeah
A	it was good so have we done our ten minutes?
B	er we've done six minutes
A	oh six
B	I think we started off fairly well
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	so what what is your son doing then I'm trying to remember?
A	he's he's a
B	that's it yeah
A	he will have qualified by er by in a couple of weeks
B	oh that's
A	yeah they they do it's a bit similar to the to the graduate training programme here where you you have six month
B	yeah
A	in different er placements
B	yeah
A	in different er parts of er of the organisation so that you kind of know everything er and then you qualify
B	I see
A	yeah well that's and I thought it worked really well the graduate trainee
B	yeah
A	thing here which
B	yeah just getting to see all the different parts of it
A	yeah that's right so
B	I don't know why they've changed it
A	they've changed it but apparently they're they're thinking of going back er to it again what's her name erm
B	oh yes yeah
A	do do you know our our intern
B	yeah she was saying she wanted
A	she wanted to do that and she spoke to er
B	oh right really?
A	and she said they were planning to go back to erm or they're thinking of going back to it and I think it takes more work it's more erm
B	right
A	kind of er time-consuming to set up
B	mm I can imagine
A	yeah but erm
B	and it was for us it worked out really well because obviously
A	yeah
B	and then has gone on to do something really interesting
A	yeah
B	related to this anyway so I think
A	yeah
B	it was kind of worth the time
A	well she's seen every you know she's seen sales she's seen editorial she's seen the research side
B	yeah so really
A	she's really done everything yeah
B	yeah I think that would have been kind of cos it's really hard when you're just starting off to think well I kind of like books
B	but you'd still want to know what the options are
A	yeah yeah
B	people
A	yeah
B	it's sort of hard to know
A	and yet editorial is quite in some ways in ELT it's quite difficult to get into directly cos
B	mm yeah
A	they kind of expect five years of
B	yeah
A	teaching experience and
B	yeah
A	erm you know in some ways going from marketing or or sales or something it's probably an easier way in
B	definitely yeah
A	yeah
B	if you're not sure ELT is for you it's a really good way of
A	yeah
B	seeing it and
A	yeah
B	finding out what it's about without needing to go off and do a
A	that's true
B	or actually
A	yeah and to go into I always think something like marketing is quite good because you it's very transferable
B	yeah
A	you know? if you
B	yeah
A	going off to er some completely different business unrelated but
B	yeah
A	but they still kind of recognised her work here as being useful
B	yeah yeah
A	whereas the ELT editorial it's kind of hard to see where you would go from that except
B	yeah it's kind of niche yeah
A	yes it's
B	mm that's true
A	so so the plan is just to chill out all weekend then?
B	yeah yeah I've got sort of a few fairly busy few kind of weeks
A	yeah
B	so again just have a
A	well I always feel like when when
B	mm
A	and it makes it sound as though I literally sat down and did nothing
B	yeah
A	but but I was doing things the whole time
A	you know I think I can't remember resting
B	yeah
A	but er I didn't do anything worth saying
B	exactly I'm sure I'll do things
A	right
B	I'll probably go for a run
A	yeah
B	erm
A	are you going are you trying the marathon training again or?
B	I'm I'm doing a ten K in October and probably a half marathon in November
A	mm
B	and then maybe a marathon next year but
A	oh that's serious
B	yeah well apparently
A	every day running
B	I I don't even think
A	no?
B	I think every day kind of something
A	yeah yeah
B	like resting and some days you're not actually running but you're doing something
A	oh right yeah
B	but that's not
A	no no okay
B	it doesn't it doesn't sound very long
A	no
B	erm so I'm thinking about picking a smallish flatish marathon and
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	well
A	there are half marathons
B	yeah exactly it's a half marathon which is really good erm
B	yeah it's quite hard to get into
A	it's a lottery or something isn't it?
B	yeah I'm thinking about starting to enter the ballot from
A	right
B	this year and just
A	yeah
B	leave my name in there and one year it'll come up
A	I'm sure erm the Lake District marathon
B	I can't think of anything worse I just can't see the appeal
A	well there is it's it makes you realise the kind of sense of erm skiing holidays cos there you get the benefit of being
B	yeah
A	at the top of a hill
B	yeah
A	and a mountain without actually having to
B	yeah exactly
A	kind of do the effort
B	and you get
A	the efforts all going down
B	the joy of coming down
A	yeah
B	I can kind of get that
A	well that's when er I realised the the fantastic thing of going to the Alps what other places which are built for skiing
B	yeah
A	in the summer because they have those ski lifts still working or some of their lifts still working
B	oh right
A	so you can get to the top and just walk down
B	that sounds perfect walking down
A	it is it's no well you can do it
B	I've never thought about that before but
A	yeah I went I went to
B	that sounds really good
A	which of course is tiring
B	yeah
A	because you use muscles you're not used to using going downhill
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	psychologically it's easier
A	yeah oh yeah well no it's definitely easier but I think it's it's not just imagined definitely easier
A	okay no it's fantastic
B	yeah
