B	mm
D	mm exactly what it is really
B	the song Olympics
D	only it's a meritocracy
B	only it's not a meritocracy no there isn't an independent judging panel and timers
D	it's not about it's never been about the song it's all
B	I guess so although I feel like they pick their favourite song from their political affiliates
D	yeah
B	so still like the best of that bunch
