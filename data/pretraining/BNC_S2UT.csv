A	no these are the ones that I bought did I tell you?
B	you said it was somewhere I couldn't remember where
A	down
B	heavy
A	I'm not thrilled with the colour but it's a lovely shape to hold
B	yes
A	erm so I bought four
B	it's strong for me
A	oh do you want some
B	no leave it I'll I'll drink it but it er it is too strong really
B	oh you
A	I really meant what do you think of flavour?
B	I don't think so
A	I think that I've tried both almond milk and soya milk erm the soya milk is slightly higher fat it mean it's still it's comparable to semi-skimmed and the almond milk is actually slightly less erm
B	I wouldn't have known it was anything different
A	no I mean there's a range of when you go there's a different ones some of them have got flavourings in and god knows what erm and some of them are sweetened well to me that turns them into
B	mm I agree
A	they're something different erm so I just went for
B	although there is sugar in milk it's lacrose isn't it?
A	yes but
B	I remember at school being told there was sugar in er there was sweetness in milk
A	mm
B	and thinking mm sort of thing and they gave us a glass of water and a glass of milk and if you compared the water with the milk yes it was sweet
A	mm
B	you could tell
A	well isn't it isn't that what the problem is that you're that you can be lactose intolerant?
B	I suppose
A	erm
B	did I didn't say lactose what did I say?
A	you said lacrose and I think that's
B	I was gonna say that was wrong
A	yeah and and I listened to it and thought
B	no
A	no it
B	you should've said
A	yeah well
B	yeah I like this beaker to hold
A	yes
B	yes
A	without it being so wide and difficult to to hold
B	mm
A	yeah
B	well erm when
A	mm
B	and eventually it got broken and I tried all over to get one like it cos I'd really liked it
A	yes
B	the hold of it and everything but I never found one
A	well if you see together the four that I bought you would you'd know that they were hand thrown these two are pretty similar in shape and everything but the
B	mm
B	I suppose it is
A	erm
B	mm
A	no
B	this morning
A	well I'm
B	mm
A	and it's the first opportunity I've had to erm to wash them I did one lot of washing
B	mm
A	as they had been when I put them out it was just such a damp grey day
B	mm
A	erm I did it and had to dry them inside and of course at this time of year they don't dry inside very quickly
B	we've had perhaps a couple of hours of slightly sunnier than all the gloom
A	yeah
B	each afternoon cos when
A	well it hasn't necessarily been cold
B	no
A	but
B	but I've had the fire on each year in
A	if oh yeah but if it's grey and damp that doesn't necessarily help does it?
B	no
A	there's one of those spider's
B	what am I look at? the glass?
A	just there through the glass a spider's web
B	yes
A	yes er
A	there was one
B	there's loads of spiders at the moment
A	yes it must be that time of year there was one in the
B	yeah
A	and it actually ended up I had to come back and clean my glasses cos they ended up with the parallel lines of the of the cobweb right across one lens it was really weird but I was very happy that I didn't end up with the spider going down my neck cos it was a large one
B	and if you go between the greenhouse and
A	yes yes well I've I get very large ones in the house sometimes sort of and they stand out particularly on the dining room carpet of course erm but well I mean they don't bother me particularly but it it is annoying to walk into the the cobwebs they seem to do that round all my doors they do it at the front door as well
B	mm I've had one or two pretty big ones in the bath which
B	well I don't want just to wash em down the bath it isn't fair
A	well yeah but there are millions of spiders in
B	they're supposed to bring good luck aren't they spiders?
A	well if you believe in things like that
B	mm
A	mm
B	well I'd rather believe in it than not
B	oh I've tried to get up that white buddleia
A	right
B	I trimmed it back to about a foot
A	right
B	so I'll get
A	okay fair enough that means it's going to be difficult to plant though doesn't it?
B	well I think you can root trim
A	mm you could do that before you dug it up then couldn't you?
B	well I thought about that as well but I I'd wait and see what he does
A	yes erm
B	he's
A	well I'll hold off on what I was thinking seeing as it was white and I ended up you know I was supposed to have blue one pink and one white
B	oh yes
A	and I didn't I ended up with two purple and one white and I don't know whether the purple ones were meant to be blue or pink because well blue or red
B	mm
A	in the er catalogue anyway I ended up with the two purples ones together erm
B	mm
A	there's now a space through to next door now you can't see it when you're sitting here because of that bush but if you're further down you can or even
B	mm
A	when I'm up on the decking I can I can if he's pottering around in the
B	mm
A	I mean it's not exactly hugely intrusive but the idea was to grow the buddleias erm
B	mm
A	in that space erm and I thought I'd put the white one between the two purple ones well at the moment they're still in pots and I won't plant them out until I've got yours
B	well
B	but you can't blame em but what they've got and it's happened over the last about three years but this year was worse is bindweed and it's around all the raspberries or it might be that way I don't know
A	yes
B	as it's done
A	yeah
B	we'll see but he's he's spent a lot of time there
A	mm
B	but
A	mm
B	pleased to see them
A	so you've had a good crop
B	well yes because
A	cos I thought you had a good crop last year
B	I was gonna say last year it was embarrassing
A	yes so I wouldn't have expected you to have had a lot this year mm
B	oh you've had some of course
A	mm yeah well I will have some more erm
B	mm
A	that I've lined with newspaper and I can I can put the space to put them in slightly separate from each other
B	right yeah
A	well we I remember doing that at at
B	I used to do it
A	at grandma's house
B	oh
A	and putting them in the back bedroom do you not remember that? apples and pears
B	well I must have done it and and everything
A	when I was a kid I can I remember doing that
B	we were certainly did it at our house when we'd apples there
A	well I er I used to do that with my apple tree actually when I think about it it depends how many you've got I suppose
B	yeah
A	as to whether it's worth it
B	yes I've done that I've got a big bag full of that
A	mm
B	in fact a bit too big
A	well again you can freeze apple pies can't you?
B	mm
B	in fact I did one apple and blackcurrant which just
A	wow
B	makes it a big different
A	there's two butterflies having a right dance just there I don't know
B	oh
B	no
A	to show you but I've got some photos
B	yes
A	erm so I've been building a compost heap as it were building you know doing it with the bricks
B	mm
A	behind that
B	right
A	the garden does actually seem to curve slightly to the left so you really can't see it from here
B	mm
A	having been nice and sunny when I started off so I just had to carry on
B	I think we're gonna end up with a darker cloudier before so long it's
A	mm
B	greyed over but I certainly think your washing will be drying
A	okay
B	yes I can see
A	so that bit I built there and that's the the compost bin you see that and I
B	yeah
A	and I put all the compost into those bags and then
B	yes
A	I mean okay it's very rough brickwork
B	well that doesn't matter does it?
A	but as long as it stands up
B	and it does the job
A	and it doesn't even need to be able to stand up you know
B	yes
A	put a spade in which is a lot more convenient than the the compost bin
B	yeah you don't stop do you?
A	well I mean the other thing I as I say I got
B	what sort of age is he?
A	sixty-nine
B	oh
A	erm I seem to have missed a year somewhere cos I he his birthday was in August
B	we had a letter I should think about three weeks ago cos I'd forgotten about it erm to say our electricity's going off in the morning
A	oh
B	they're doing some cable work
B	I can't bear it I have to
A	yeah
B	and erm
A	mm
B	but as I say this came at least three weeks ago and I'd completely forgotten about it whether it will matter or not I don't know because I haven't anything fancy switched on it mentioned burglar alarms and
A	oh right
B	but
A	I wouldn't have thought I mean I certainly
B	they ought to have reminded us
A	yes if they tell you that early I if I have occasionally I don't know about at this house actually but at the other house more than once there must have been some sort of power cut
B	yeah
A	because you notice that some things are flashing or whatever
B	yeah
A	you know erm and burglar alarm was never seemed to be affected at all I would just have thought that a modern burglar alarm was designed so that it it could ride out things like that because it does happen
B	mind you ours isn't all that modern you see it'll be
A	no but mine at the other house wasn't
B	no
A	I mean it might have been newer than yours but I when you when you have the new
B	double glazing?
A	no no thing put on on that those are not the buttons that you originally had are they?
B	probably not
A	so keypad that's the word I'm looking when you had that was it a whole new burglar alarm or did you just have a new keypad put there?
B	I think it was just a new keypad cos
A	mm
B	in the first place
A	right
B	and we never had any deeper work done in other words
A	mm
B	climbing in the loft or anything so it must just have been a new keypad and I don't know who did it and I don't know why
A	mm
B	but erm I mentioned it to
A	well it could be couldn't it?
B	yes
A	if they're doing all that er
B	yeah
A	building work
B	I haven't seen
A	mm
B	involved or not
A	mm
B	and where it crossed the road there was a concrete slab weighting it down so that nobody tripped or whatever
A	mm
B	and we can't imagine what that was
A	mm
B	there was nothing draining from it there was no water coming out
A	oh that's weird
B	well I mean it couldn't be gas and it couldn't be electricity so goodness knows what they're doing
A	oh that was I'm not sure what something come some sort of did you see?
B	no
A	go to my
B	no
A	cos I haven't seen anything at the bird feeder for at least a week and I found that happened last year at this sort of time I'd had quite a lot of activity over the summer and then not in the autumn and I don't know where they go and what they're doing and whether it's because you you actually get different birds in summer and winter and this is the changeover period which it is
B	mm mm
A	erm but I don't know about
B	they're coming
A	yes these are the grey tits hello darlings
B	mm
A	because that all three that landed then looked to be adults to me and I don't think there were three
A	it's not the size it's the it I mean they the they were they were the same sort of size it's just the markings
B	when I was down with the raspberries obviously I I took that little erm seat that I sit on to weed and so on and I was quite happy down there by myself bit of birdsong around and suddenly there was a a movement and it was a robin and it came and it came round the other side of me and it came down there and it looked at me and I
B	erm but it didn't go away particularly mind you I didn't make any big movements and it's done it about three or four different days
A	oh good
B	so
A	you see the robin that comes here
B	oh
A	but the robin that comes here isn't like that it's very shy
B	mm
A	mm yeah
B	no I haven't seen the jay for a while and we we
A	I saw it in the tree the other day but it hasn't been to the feeder that I think it's probably moved on you know
B	mm
A	the things like that do seem to go in in phases
B	and I've not heard a woodpecker this year I don't think
A	no
B	and we always have done
A	and I
B	I'm feeling something yes
A	and you're finished and you turn it
B	oh it's there
A	and look on the if you don't turn it and look on the bottom unless you've finished
B	you might
A	it says
B	oh
A	which I thought was odd because
A	yes is at least your generation if not older whereas she clearly wasn't
B	older I hadn't any
A	right yeah
B	right
A	front room windowsill it's
B	oh
A	it's doesn't
B	mm
A	so it still looks quite sort of scratched but most of it you don't really see it because of the blind and the fact that it's now white instead of a nasty tacky brown varnish stuff not
B	mm
A	not brown varnish veneer erm
B	oh mm
A	does look definitely better so I'm I'm leaving it like that for now
B	so have you much more to do with your house?
A	well there's the upstairs room to do which I I'm planning to do probably at Christmas
B	oh
A	in other words the work that
B	mm
A	I don't think that I'm going to be able to do that myself and the one of the reasons being that I can't get the big powerful strimmer to start when
B	mm
A	it's a it's a petrol-driven thing and you need to pull a string to spark it erm and even if you've got one foot on it it's a lot easier if someone's also holding it
B	mm
A	but also you need to do it a few times with
A	and a very long body
B	mm
A	which meant obviously it wasn't gonna spark erm
B	mm
A	the four kilo
B	mm
A	because
B	so er how much would you want him?
A	well I need him to come and look at it and tell me
B	mm
A	erm
B	mm
A	I could only do half an hour at a time and then my back was seizing up
B	mm
A	erm and I can't get a lot done in half an hour he could probably do more than me in half an hour anyway
B	mm
A	but I don't know
B	well he's going away at the end of this month
A	well I mean it's not urgent but it needs doing this autumn
B	well
A	so that I can
B	I'll certainly ask him but I don't know how much time
A	no
B	he's prepared to spend on things cos I don't know who else he goes to
A	well it's not going to be an ongoing it's a sort of one-off job getting it cleared that I've planted it with this meadow grass and I shouldn't have done I should have left it clear
B	mm
A	and then I would have to keep it weed free
B	yeah
A	well there's no point in doing it too soon because the grass is still growing a bit
B	mm
A	but so it
B	right
A	to replace that one that died so it needs doing before that would come
B	I'm pleased with that rhododendron you found
A	oh good
B	it er it looks a really good bush so we used to have I'm keeping the receipt because they will replace things well like
A	mm well I mean it wasn't exactly cheap was it? but it
B	no
A	I found that
B	yes
A	things like that are
B	well I wasn't expecting to pay that I think I'd thought probably thirteen or fourteen pounds but I've thought about a rhododendron down there for a long time
A	mm
B	so I thought right I'll have one
B	lovely sunshine's going
A	well the amount of trouble once they're in you just leave them
B	well yes and it's exactly I mean deliberately where I can see it from the kitchen
A	mm
B	which is is what I wanted because there's a fuchsia there that hasn't really grown much at all and when I think about fuchsias there isn't a right lot of colour for the size of the bush
A	I think that depends on the fuchsia well I went walking in
B	mm
A	and they were they were they were sort of this size
B	mm mm
A	actual foliage now it may be that when they get bigger that happens less I think the one that I had at the other house was pretty good value but this one here
B	yeah that was when you came up the steps weren't it?
A	yes but this one here is as you're saying it's a lot of
B	yeah
A	erm I'm just kind of waiting for the blossom to die down a bit more and then I'm going to cut it down completely and put something else there because it it also just grows so much in a season that I'm constantly having to cut it back to able to use the path which is silly
B	mm oh I've had the notice about the brown bins
A	oh right so you are getting them
B	so I've an October collection of green bags
A	mm
B	and then that's it till something like April fourth when it will be bin it
A	mm
B	which I thought was a bit odd and then I thought well there must be a lot of people who've had green bags who've never ever used em
A	mm
B	so same with brown bins I suppose
A	well I don't think that
B	oh
A	and and they certainly put other things out
B	but you rang up to order it?
A	oh yeah
B	mm
A	so but I mean obviously they've got quite a big garden so I don't know why they've made that choice
B	mm
A	yes well I mean it said
B	er
A	something like it holds the equivalent of three to five
B	yes
A	green bags well for a start there's a big difference between three and five and secondly no way does it hold five green bags worth that's just ridiculous
B	mm
A	erm and anything that's a bit of an awkward shape
B	yes
A	whereas it won't into the bin so you're having to spend more time cutting things down to fit I'm still using the green bags as well
B	well I'm keeping them at the moment to see how it all goes
A	yes well I've exactly I mean I had five or six er and I'm keeping those
B	I think I have five now
A	and
B	I think I once had seven
A	I'm having to
B	mm
A	erm
B	yes
A	and said we're sorry darlings but it's a lot easier for our bin men
B	yes
A	then fair enough because it is
B	it going cold?
A	it's a bit cooler now the sun's gone hasn't it?
B	mm
A	erm you know if you read the rest of the thing which
B	it's blowing more
A	which is clearly sort of addressing possible complaints and and queries and so on
B	mm
A	it's obvious that a lot of people's immediate reaction is oh no that's not very good for me
B	mm well it just depends how much garden you've got really
A	yes
B	mm
A	people averaged if you see what I mean
B	mm
A	mm
B	mind you I've had two fairly new ones I I mean a year older more than that with their handles sort of in the middle of the sides rather than on top and they've been very difficult to carry
A	oh oh no I haven't got any like that but erm I mean a couple of mine are bit sort of torn and battered
B	yeah
A	but they're still worth keeping it depends what you put in them anyway doesn't it?
B	mm
A	if the if it's mostly branches that's fine if it's small things they might fall through the hole but er
B	mm well I've cut my own buddleia back as well because that's er finished I don't think there's anything else that wants cutting back those bushes where the leaves come red when they're new
A	mm
B	erm
A	mm
B	and I like a natural shape
A	yeah well I I'm going to have to buy a hedge trimmer because
B	I've got one you could have it because he uses his own it he he doesn't use mine
A	yours is
B	mm
A	I mean
B	well you can try it yeah
A	I mean I've got an
B	oh you've got that have you?
A	er yes
B	not that I've been looking for it I'd forgotten about it
A	well again I thought that you said that
B	he does
A	and therefore you
B	yeah
A	didn't really need it erm and obviously I need that for mowing the lawn and and things and and erm I like that better than the one that I inherited which is a lighter sort of thing erm so I could see how that went
B	yeah
A	I inherited a hedge trimmer and it had been left with petrol in it over winter which you're not supposed to do and that had perished something inside and
A	and he and he was just determined to sort it but he never did of course and it and it's still up there unfinished and so unsorted and I suspect it never will even
B	mm
A	even if I took it in to be repaired I just think it's probably beyond repair erm and you pay so much for a professional to do that sort of thing I might as well buy a new one but I've got I mean that thing there needs trimming erm that green thing in by the pond
B	mm
A	erm but now in the front garden there's another green thing like that that grows over where you walk up the path
B	mm
A	that I haven't done anything to for quite a while that is getting a bit straggly and needs sorting erm the hebes need a bit of trimming and as I say I want to cut that fuchsia down if I start doing all that with my hand clippers it really makes my hands shake I find
B	mm
A	erm and there's quite possibly things down the garden as well I'm not very sure
B	mm
A	and see how it goes but it may just be too awkward to use a
B	it could be yes
A	I mean I did borrow it for that holly hedge at the other house
B	oh did you?
A	mm erm
B	well you may as well give it a try
A	mm so I certainly know I can I mean it's
B	mm
A	for heaven's sake you know
B	and is it by the house?
A	no no no I mean it's where there are others but there's
B	right
A	being Germany there's all sorts of rules and a certain percent of it percentage of it has to be given up to produce
B	oh
A	which I think is good and all sorts of things but they come round and inspect it from time to time and and she was saying they're going to get into trouble cos their hedge was too high and she couldn't use the hedge trimmer
B	is she the same sort of age as him?
A	she's a few years younger erm I would say
B	I'd imagined her your age I mean
A	no she's
B	I must have seen her
A	erm she's more than ten years older than me but not a lot more so I would say she's probably about sixty-three or four now
B	mm well didn't you go for something like a special birthday?
A	that
B	fiftieth good heavens
A	yeah erm
B	mm
A	so she must be sixty-four
B	mm
A	cos her birthday's at the end of August
B	yep
A	erm yes she had a bit do well she she did have a do for her sixtieth erm but where they were before of course they had a big they had a detached house with quite a big garden and they rented a marquee and put that up
B	mm
A	erm and invited all the
B	and did you go?
A	all the neighbourhood and everything no only for the fiftieth yes
B	oh
A	but for the sixtieth obviously they're they're now in a flat so they couldn't do that
B	mm
A	and I think they rented the village hall which is probably if it's attached to the church it'll be kind of next door cos the church is just over the wall stroke hedge from where they live because sometimes when I've been skyping
B	mm
A	well yes I can
B	mm
A	as I say I
B	do you iron those sheets?
A	no
B	well I don't I just wondered if er if you had to depends quite what they're made of
A	they're just cotton but I need to buy a fitted cotton sheet I don't know why I haven't got one because I used to have flannelette sheets on in the winter and cotton ones on in the summer
B	mm
A	and then I stopped bothering with the cotton ones because actually even in the summer it's not particularly warm
B	no
A	erm and I just like the feel of flannelette
B	bit unusual that
A	yeah but as I say I would have had two because I'd have been alternating so I don't know but
B	mm
A	the last time
B	oh
A	erm she's doing what she did last time which is come over
B	has she been here?
A	no she's seen photos but she came
B	oh yes
A	at the airport sort of thing?
B	yes
A	because she was
B	great
A	very nice in Umbria erm cos they've actually invited me to go over
B	mm
A	the last time I went which is at least two Christmases ago if not three it
B	mm
A	because they've only got one spare room with
B	you know
A	no I've never met her because
B	oh
B	yeah
A	because well at their flat they they've basically got a spare bedroom I mean they've got they've each got a study in theory it's a four-bedroomed flat
B	mm
A	but that's what they were looking for because they'll each like to have a study so I suppose they could put up a camp bed in one of the studies
B	mm
A	erm but
B	so are you thinking you'll go?
A	well
B	mm
A	erm
B	oh
A	so that doesn't really fit and at the moment
B	mm
A	it's so bad
B	I'm surprised that coffee doesn't upset your stomach
A	well I don't I it does if I have more in an afternoon that's why I don't
B	mm
B	yes
B	mm
A	and I looked and there really weren't any flights to Perugia from a from anywhere reasonable up here erm cos I was hoping that there would be from erm
B	mm
A	in a double thingy but
B	well the thing is you will be driving in the worst of our weather to get to an airport here
A	yes so I don't know I want to go from anywhere but Leeds
B	there were quite a lot of flights cancelled this last week because of fog in the south
A	mm yeah
B	mm lost my ring on the
A	I mean when I went to Rome I think there was it there was a Jet two flight from direct from Leeds to Rome which would be the best option but I tried to check that and they weren't coming up so I don't really know about that so that's all a bit in the air
B	mm
A	what would be fantastic would be if this consultant did do a Friday afternoon and I could get in to see her sooner than that
B	is there is that on the cards?
A	well I didn't I say that her secretary said she would get back to me if?
B	oh yes
A	I even wonder if it would be worth in another week or so ringing up the
B	yes I think it would be
A	and saying has that rota been sorted out yet and so on because
B	cos you're making a just a polite query aren't you?
A	well
B	mm
A	somebody should have let somebody know something or a note
B	mm
A	should have been sent on and that sort of thing erm
B	oh
A	so she obviously is fairly efficient
B	mm
A	but
B	yeah
A	well as is say I want to mow the lawn this afternoon erm and I think that that those orange roses have pretty much finished and I'm going to cut them back a bit because
B	mm
A	the strong wind so
B	well I look out of the window as I pull the curtains back each morning and see which of my roses has got a flower bud on that might come out
A	mm
B	yes
A	I might have another blooming of those
B	I've a pink one that with a sort of open rose that er it I think it was bought as ground cover
A	mm
B	and that's done extremely well this year but it needs to spread a bit
A	mm
B	it's got a fair space around it I know what I was going to say to you I was talking to
A	mm
B	and she said er oh I've never seen a white buddleia
A	oh
B	er but I've got an orange one
A	good heavens
B	mm
A	but you see that one of mine was supposed to be orangey yellow that's actually turned out white
B	well I've never seen that
A	no
B	anywhere
A	well it was it it didn't say buddleia it was
B	oh
A	but when you looked at the Latin name it was a it was a something but it it that was where I saw the buddleia bit
B	right
A	erm
B	so it's presumably the same family but
A	mm
B	slightly off
A	mm well except that what I've actually got isn't what I was supposed to have clearly
A	yeah there's a lot of butterfly activity today
B	I've noticed it while I've been here
A	mm I've been looking in the
B	oh
A	they seem to have two periods when the when they're active and I don't quite know what that's about
B	well now I've cut my buddleia back which was only a few days ago there's not a lot for em to come to out of my kitchen window
A	mm
B	which is where I look
A	well I was obviously was looking to see
B	mm
A	and quite a lot of them lay their eggs on nettles lovely
B	yes I think I knew that
A	erm but quite a few of them ivy well of course there's tonnes of ivy over there on that that is a wall there that looks like a hedge
B	oh
A	erm
B	right
A	so that may be one reason why I I've there've been a lot of butterflies
B	it never stops does it the garden
A	no
B	there's always something you have to do
A	well no things like creating
B	mm
A	it's either
B	mm
A	making sure you've got the right plants in or things like you know I've got quite a few pieces of stone that I've just sort of piled under those trees down there at the end of the garden
B	yeah
A	that isn't in the bit that isn't really being used so that things might hibernate
B	ah right
A	you know
B	yes
A	erm
B	like slugs
A	well preferably not like slugs but
A	well
B	and I was seeing them quite often
A	mm
B	yeah well I suppose I'd better make my way home it was still busy at
A	oh I didn't tell you I was I was in well it was the
B	oh yes yes
A	erm I was manning a stall there yesterday for the RSPB
B	oh right of what? information?
A	well they sell things and erm a tombola that was kind of aimed at kids
B	mm
A	erm I mean
B	was
A	it wasn't a tombola it was actually a bag
B	lucky dip
B	was it well attended?
A	yes cos I the first year that I joined the local group I went along to do to help them with that and it was a nasty wet day and we got hardly anybody and it was really not good at all well did I say I've joined the committee?
B	no
A	I thought well I'm not doing the theatre any more so I can do it and he's
B	mm
A	er HQ erm so there was a committee meeting last Monday erm partly to sort things out for this so we did a rota and I was doing one till three
B	mm
A	which actually was a bit of an awkward time cos I thought well then how when do I eat? so in the end I walked down cos I thought that'll give me my exercise for the day and I went I was going to go to
B	there's a new Italian one I think
A	well I wouldn't have said it was Italian but well
B	no
A	yes it had pasta but
B	the reason I haven't been but I met
A	well there's there's I passed somewhere else that I would have called a caff and of course there's
B	oh
A	erm and the terrace and this all along that one little stretch erm I mean in fact there were quite a lot of things down in
B	there's a something called
A	right well where
B	oh oh
A	erm very nice erm
B	mm
A	and relatively light bites but erm a reasonable range and and
B	mm
A	erm so I did that and had quite an early lunch and then
B	yeah
A	went down to this store and yeah mm it was
B	did I tell you that I fell in the house?
A	no
B	it was quite funny actually in fact it was ridiculous er what happened I'd had I'd put the fire on and I must have slightly dozed off it was after dinner and I tend to do this each afternoon now and suddenly realised it was time to go tell
A	mm
B	and my foot must have gone to sleep and I found I was spinning round
B	and I grabbed the fan was there and I grabbed the fan and I grabbed this that and the other and I ended up sitting in the wastepaper basket
B	well I sat there and sort of laughed to myself cos I wasn't hurting anywhere
A	I mean you were flipping lucky that you weren't
B	and I couldn't get up I thought I can't sit here till
A	well you could have shouted I suppose
B	well I could yes eventually I I got enough strength to to push on but there's nothing much to push on there
A	no
B	I mean you can't push on a wastepaper basket
A	no
B	to get up and the fan was there
A	well I suppose you could have tilted yourself over and crawled
B	oh I thought of all those things
B	eventually I did it but I was telling
A	mm
B	sort of every time and I'm afraid I am doing that I'm getting up and standing just for a second or two
A	mm
B	till I know my feet are working
A	mm
B	so it's this leg that I haven't fully got control over now I'm afraid so
A	mm
B	you'll be wheeling me out one of these days
A	you'll be lucky
B	well you could carry me out in the wastepaper basket
A	it's a great shame there wasn't anybody there with a camera
B	it it's I sat there and I thought this is daft and I actually started to laugh
A	well but you were lucky that you didn't crack your head on the wall or something at that point
B	well yes and there's the corner of the erm
A	yeah yeah
B	that's got the clock on and so on
A	yeah yeah
A	mm yes
B	and I didn't hurt anything but it made me feel helpless
A	mm
B	and I don't like that
A	yeah
B	in which case I had better go home
A	yeah
B	and do something I don't know what
