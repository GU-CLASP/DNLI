A	so this was eighty-nine down to twenty-six
C	bargain

B	for nineteen twenties white button up kind of sheer type tuck in
A	ah
B	I mean
A	in an ideal world
B	not that I'm suggesting yeah that you go out and now buy a new shirt to go with it
A	yeah
B	but in an ideal world
A	yeah
B	ooh
C	ooh
A	it's quite bright isn't it
B	I like it though
A	it's well it's very different to the other one I tried on
B	mm
A	the other one that I tried on was like a grey swooshy one with er diamondy straps
B	mm
A	it just looked a bit tatty
C	is it an oriental theme or something
A	no no just this one  this one  looks like it is
C	mm
A	but it's
A	quite bright
B	mhm
A	jacket
B	tux jacket'll look really good with that
A	yeah
A	and one said one was going to wear old clothes from one's wardrobe
B	mm
A	that didn't really work
B	no
A	so I think I got a bit carried away about saving so much money
A	on the hotel and the flights yesterday that I'm like right I'm rich
B	well after taking five hundred pound out of my account for er the
A	five hundred pounds?
B	mm
A	your rent is ridic
B	mm
C	you're playing catch-up though ain't you
B	mm
C	mm
A	oh man
B	no money at all
B	none
A	oh man
B	mm
A	well at least it's gonna be a quiet month
B	well I thought I'd rather just get it out the way and have no money
A	mm
B	and get it over and out of this month rather than having it hanging over my head for next month
A	birthday month or
B	er April
A	yeah but just in terms of when you get paid
B	mm
A	before your birthday
B	mm
A	yeah
B	we don't have to
A	well I mean you're the birthday girl
B	I don't mind
C	always have a shindig here couldn't we? Bit of a quiet one to celebrate your
A	we're going to
C	oh are you?
A	mm
C	ah
A	but on your actual birthday cos it's midweek isn't it
B	oh yeah
A	mm
B	family
A	if you and
B	if I've not killed one of them
A	but banging
C	have you seen the bathroom?
A	it's grim
B	what?
C	they moaned at my
B	mm
C	Carmen
A	so she's putting the
B	oh my God
C	and I
B	freaks me out
C	I found lumps in the bathroom in the toilet and the
A	and then she just they're just really inconsiderate
C	I'm not touching it
A	like I was in the shower yesterday
B	mm
A	shower when the washing machine's on for example
C	yeah
A	she bangs into the toilet uses the toilet when you can hear that someone's in the shower
C	yeah
A	could of just for fuck's sake and then I heard her bedroom door go and I thought that's just massively inconsiderate
C	yeah
B	that's exactly what I was saying to her
A	mm
B	when she started on for an argument
A	mm
B	she said well cos I got up one morning um and it was like half eight or something but I'd not got to be up
A	mm
B	got up
A	mm
B	I was think I told you yesterday after the day before she'd woke me up and I said she went morning I went thanks for waking me up
C	mm
B	the next day she did the same thing
A	mm
B	I just would
C	yeah
B	I don't mind
C	I'm the same
A	and at that time in the morning
B	mm
A	so really weekdays it's a given that you've gotta be quiet until at least nine o'clock
B	yeah
A	and then weekends later because you wanna have a lie in if you  if you
C	mm
A	choose to
B	mm
A	I think I mean
B	and they were saying that they
A	it's just common sense
B	both
A	shit
B	because that's late
A	right
B	and they said
A	never mind the fact that you pay the rent
B	that I'm not entitled
A	what well er well that's a big shame cos I do cos I get up at six
B	and I said to
C	mm
B	well ten o'clock's late for me
A	she has afternoon sleeps though to be fair
B	yeah
A	she must do
B	but it doesn't matter what time you sleep
A	yeah
B	I'm saying that that's that's that's late for me
A	mm
B	if I've got to work on an eight  on an eight  shift
A	it's very strange isn't it
B	well cheers
A	it's not like not empathizing with anyone in the house
C	no
B	but it was just she was so bold about it
A	yeah
B	and I thought why why would you be purposefully rude to anyone like that?
A	yeah
C	mm
A	mm
C	mm
A	I mean she's obviously lived here a while
B	mm
A	and um after we'd she'd torn the signs down
C	wow
A	but
B	yeah
C	I don't when I know you two guys are out
A	mm
C	my
A	mm
C	I don't give a fuck if anyone else upstairs is sleeping
B	mm
A	mm
C	I I can hear
A	just sort of kitchen noise
A	oh really?
B	oh
C	yeah
A	God she must have been noisy then
C	yeah
A	what
B	mm
A	having a shower late?
C	mhm
A	well it just makes such a racket doesn't it?
C	it does
A	mm
B	mm
A	it's hard
C	mm
A	you've gotta eat
B	yeah
C	Cos there's no way you'd wanna
A	and we're all sleeping
C	shower and then eat would you?
A	no
C	you'd wanna eat and then have a shower
A	well if you haven't eaten er since since like lunchtime
C	mm
A	or like
B	mm
A	mid-afternoon snack yeah you are gonna be
C	yeah
A	ingesting yourself by the time you get home
C	yeah
B	mm
C	but can you imagine working as much as what
A	well it's
B	yeah
A	one of the colleges isn't it so it's probably not shit food
C	oh no they do cos you get shit food don't you? You don't get swanky food
B	yeah ours is a lot worse than the colleges
C	yeah
B	A lot worse
A	the colleges all get I mean the staff get the the food that the students get I think
B	mm
A	it's all good stuff
B	yeah
A	huh do you know what I've just remembered?
B	hmm
A	we've still got ice-cream in the fridge
A	and I realized I was eating
C	oh dear
B	I
A	mm
B	mm?
A	I was on the hunt for contracts and we were um I just had a quite an investigative day today
C	you felt important
A	yeah I did feel important
C	yeah
A	it was quite nice
C	yeah
B	well they don't care about that
A	but it's all to do with confidence
B	yeah
C	it's taking pride in your work isn't it so
A	yeah
C	mm
A	and when people come to you and say well can you give me a hand with this? Can you look at these budgets? Can you tell me this information? You do sort of feel like cor this is quite a good job that I do like
B	yeah
A	it's quite varied
C	mm
A	it's quite rewarding actually
A	I feel quite  I feel quite  sorry for her
B	no
C	no
A	it's just you writing contracts
B	mm
A	you know processing invoices
A	it's really boring
A	yep
B	and they've been saying that to me since we got I got that job
A	mm
B	even though everyone knows it's absolute bullcrap
A	yeah
B	like it's mental
A	mm
B	she they have this  thing so basically your time your manager to say this is actually what I really think
A	oh okay
B	this is what's pissing me off
A	mm
B	um
A	mm
B	you know I think we've got to the point with each other now especially after just before Christmas that we'll just be completely honest with each other
A	mm
B	completely honest
A	no
B	and one was HR and one was the er G GM so it was
A	Great
B	maybe it was six including them
B	in your life
C	no
B	won't stand up for us
A	mm
B	when he knows it
A	charming
B	he just sucks it up
A	yeah
B	and we have to suck it up
A	yeah
B	part of the audit call is for us to sell an iPad iPod promotion
A	mhm
B	you spend over twelve grand you get a free iPad
A	oh nice
B	really good considering
A	mm
B	that it's quite easy to spend that money in meetings
A	mm
C	mm
B	and it turns out we're getting tested on it
A	did they tell you that your bonus is at risk?
B	er yes
A	oh right
B	but then I sell it
A	mm
B	and I manage to get a fucker to have it and then oh actually our hotel's not part of it
A	right
B	so there's certain hotels within the property that aren't part of this promotion
A	and they hadn't bothered to tell you?
B	I said are you kidding me?
A	mm
B	losing our bonus
A	mm
B	we get
A	yeah
B	and then actually sell it
A	yeah
B	that they're not getting it
A	oh they're actually not getting it?
B	yeah
A	oh shit
B	because we're not part of the promotion
A	that's mental
B	I said no way
A	yeah
B	I'm not telling them
A	yeah
B	bullshit
A	yeah
B	so
A	you can't do that
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	so he then took it out of the budget
A	but er er how is that cost-effective? So your
B	well it's not
A	your budget is being eaten up by these fucking iPads
B	iPads
A	mm
B	cos if you forget to ask for it
A	because it it's not applicable
B	yeah
A	Jesus
B	yep
C	yeah
A	getting a bit warm
B	which we love so we won't complain
A	we love the heat
B	so
A	mm
B	um whether
A	mm
B	um
A	right
B	and then she thought do you know what they're not even gonna take this on board
A	it's an honesty workshop
B	but you can't
A	be truthful
B	the GM just none of er they all know they can't be honest
A	right
B	and if unless you give him the answer he wants he doesn't wanna know
A	right
B	he's horrendous
A	God
B	as a manager as far as a manager goes I've never seen anything like it
A	bloody Nora
B	so
A	mm
B	I want to she
A	mm
B	you know really personal things
A	mm
B	how can I support you?
A	mm
B	how can we change your work relationship? Work life balance is actually one of our initial
A	Good
B	aim things
A	objectives
B	work life balance
A	mm
B	no
B	what?
A	was it that he just thinks if someone is
B	he's just a shit manager
A	he just doesn't care
B	he's got no people skills
A	how has he got so far?
B	none
A	yeah
B	like she's actually very sick
A	right
B	and his response which obviously was really responsible of him
A	yeah
B	as a person in the world
A	yeah
B	never mind her direct line manager
B	was alright then
A	off you  off you  trot
B	if you if you're gonna go make sure you give me notice before the end of the week
A	and try not to have a break-down on your way out of the door
B	yeah
A	shit
B	can you imagine? And apparently he walked into the room when they  when they  were all wrapping up the post-it thing and said um so come on then team you know do we all feel like we can be honest? Eve said the silence was deafening
B	not one of them coughed up and said something
A	yeah
B	they have different departments
A	mm
B	um
A	he heard the answer like
B	yeah
A	he heard something in his head
B	yeah
A	he doesn't care
B	no
A	bloody hell
B	mm
A	so they go to the training and they go yeah right tick that box yeah I know how to be a line manager now cos I've done two days of training
B	yeah
A	therefore I'm excellent
B	that makes me one
A	that makes me a manager
B	I love shoes
A	and
B	I think I'll be one
A	yeah
B	I think I'll be one
A	that's good
B	yeah
A	and really there's nothing that's done about it at that point
B	but the workforce
A	but the workforce is dwindling
B	yeah
A	and actually that's such a massive like the resourcing is such a massive part of your company
B	yeah
A	people in or the good people are leaving and you've got no one left
B	that's exactly what I said to
A	what does that say?
B	I said
A	right
B	when I leave
A	yeah
B	um
A	right
B	which is why cos she's been held fire for a little while
A	okay
B	um but cos  her manager treats her like shit
A	it's probably better money at Carluccio's
B	it's better money
C	mm
B	and that's what she's saying
A	hang fire
B	hang fire
A	mm
B	you know it's only  you know it's only  gonna be five months six months
A	mm
B	before we can move you
A	yeah
B	hang fire
A	mm
B	but obviously she can't and she doesn't see the bigger picture
A	it is really hard
B	and that's just everyone's just gonna go
A	really
B	F and B manager's leaving
A	mm
B	they'll both be gone
A	is that the mythical I'm gotta live in
B	that's the mythical I've got to live in
A	okay
B	I don't think he'll stay
A	mm
B	really
A	what about
B	Simon will probably stay
A	mm
B	I don't think he wants to
A	mm
B	and it it would really push him far enough
A	mm
B	I think  I think  they would let him have a stab at it
A	mm
B	they'd at least I
A	mm
B	Cos he supports
A	Good
B	yep
A	mm
B	so high
A	but surely that should like flag up somewhere higher in the echelons
B	yeah
A	you know those numbers are being crunched
B	in the region say
A	as a whole would think Christ what is that what's that GM doing?
B	yeah
A	like why what is going on there?
B	it's mad
A	mm
B	Cos
A	mm
B	and she was like what? Cos she even said to me like I go to these ECF meetings
A	mm
B	and do you know what he said? I went to the ECF meeting
A	okay
B	not personally
A	mm
B	fine
A	mhm
B	um housekeeping agreed with me
A	mm
B	they do it's a physical job
A	mm
B	for one meal or everyday as it happens in this hotel
B	you require as a human being that many carbs
A	mm
B	never mind to hoover the floor
A	yeah
B	you don't
A	well er
B	you can't take it
A	yeah it's ridiculous
B	yeah
A	a long long day
B	yeah
A	no it's just silly
B	I said they need you know they need some carbs
A	mm
B	you know to replace their energy
A	yeah
B	with vitamins in it
A	yeah
B	they don't need pasta with chips and
A	bread
B	naan bread
B	which is what they serve
A	yeah
B	um and apparently the GM went back to
B	ha
A	well it's shit so
B	just to
A	just what?
B	A pebble in your pond
A	pebble in your pond
B	basically I'm gonna drop this make ripples and I'm gonna disturb your nice little calm surface
A	that's such a weird thing to say
B	yeah
A	how dare you question the regime?
B	it was quite yeah it was quite
A	right
B	very diplomatic
A	right
B	at work if something's happened and no one else has witnessed it
A	mm
B	some of the people at work believe that the way I speak to them or speak to my friends or you know oh what a fucking knob jockey
B	on a professional level
A	mm
B	you know  you know  how snappy I can be
A	yeah
B	and how sharp I can be with my tongue
A	mm
B	but er in a work environment with a client
A	mm
B	no way
A	mm
B	there is
A	yeah
B	even say something that could be misconstrued
A	mm
B	I know not to do that
A	yeah
B	so she trusts me
B	and she said I know
A	that's horrible
B	what's the point? Yeah
A	you might as well just roll over and die now
A	huh it just it that just makes me feel very tired and very unhappy for everybody who works there
B	yeah
A	you know who has no sort of light at the end of the tunnel
B	yeah
A	at
B	yeah
A	I mean really you're on whatever you're on and
B	no I think
A	so really I don't know  I don't know  whether a shop job is the answer but she could get something else that's
B	and would definitely pay more
A	and would pay her more
B	yeah
A	mm
B	this was whole brand new to me
A	mm
B	um
B	she was like what?
A	mm
B	so I told him
A	panic
A	what the hell's she been saying?
B	you could see the lights going in her head
B	and he basically said cos we had this like you know The Times top ten companies to work for?
A	mm
B	or whatever it is
A	mm
B	well
B	couldn't tell you why
A	it's always top ten?
B	yeah
A	God
B	top ten or top twenty
A	mm
B	yeah
C	hiya
B	Don't know how
A	so that's that's that's
C	everything alright?
A	staff are voting it's
B	yes
A	a good place to work?
B	oh yeah
A	well maybe they're all its staff are sheep
C	I'll just we'll start after cooking dinner
A	maybe they're all just
B	sheep Vegas
A	sheep
B	sheep Vegas
A	presumably none of the ones in Cambridge are sheep though? Like the half of them have left
B	yeah
C	anyway how are you doing?
B	yeah
A	they've just been indoctrinated
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	cool
B	survey's come back like crap
C	cool
A	oh really?
B	yeah
C	are they alright?
B	um
C	are they alright?
B	I was really negative on mine
C	yeah
B	thirty-nine percent drop
C	yeah
A	single-handedly
B	seeing as the department consists of eight of us
A	possibly
A	minus one hundred
B	and ten
A	minus infinity
B	yeah so
A	they're shit
B	we were sat in the back of the car and he said you know what do you mind me asking cos there was me from you know sales and res and then
A	mm
B	in that room
A	mm
B	and I said do you want to know the truth?
B	and you could see the
A	mm
B	and um he said yes yes I certainly do
A	mm
B	you're sat on skills that you you don't ever use
A	mm
B	I said cos it's such a big spaced out team that apart from your direct line manager which if you're not lucky enough to work in my office you probably never get to see
A	mm
B	has no idea what you're like
B	you haven't got a clue
A	right
B	then you don't  you don't  care
A	mm
B	and I think before Christmas especially because then we took on agency staff
A	mm
B	so we bulked out the workforce
A	mm
B	people weren't having personal development
A	mm
B	and he said oh er that that shocks me quite a lot
A	but er but how how is that a surprise?
B	yeah
A	mm
B	um
B	A philosophy graduate
A	mm
B	she speaks three languages
A	hmm
B	there one day and was teaching Daria
A	mm
B	I said  was brilliant
A	mm
B	she was great
A	mm
B	um and I know she had a conversation about becoming supervisor
A	mm
B	I said where's  now? He said I don't know
A	and how big is the hotel? Like how many staff does he have?
B	A hundred
A	A hundred
B	A hundred and fifty
A	God that's really bad
B	isn't it
A	Cos my group director Geoff of our group the he's probably responsible obviously er it cascades down but he's probably responsible for seventy people including the US
B	you should
A	on the team
B	yeah you should
A	so this whole carry on of I don't know where that person is
B	yeah
A	and but you've gotta trust that their line manager's cos you're responsible for hiring your next in charge
B	yeah
A	and you've gotta trust that they're that that then carries on
B	they're doing that
A	but he's obviously not taking any active interest in his staff
B	not at all
A	so does
B	yeah
A	so he would be saying to her how is your team getting on? What are they working on? And what are they performing well on? Like talk to me about your staff
B	yeah
A	and they he's obviously not saying that to them
B	no
A	because he would know
B	no
A	nice
B	came back and brought us some chocolate
A	mm
B	and apparently
A	really?
B	yeah
A	mm mm mm
B	I was like fuck yeah
A	yeah but he's the
B	so he should
A	he's the GM
B	yeah
A	you know
B	yeah
A	giving the instruction
B	isn't it  isn't it  warped?
A	I've never known anything like it
B	mm
A	it's got to be your decision really hasn't it really
B	I don't think I'm gonna gain anything out of it
A	mm
B	right now
A	mm
B	mm
A	it might just mean that you know before you go you get on the boat
B	you make damage that's irreparable
A	yeah and then
B	the last conversation ever
A	possibly
B	mm
A	for four years
B	yeah
A	I would just um
B	mm
A	for sure
B	and at least while I don't get that from him it's something I can be angry at him for
A	yeah
B	mm
A	hmm
B	ice-cream makes the world go round doesn't it
A	mm
B	mm
A	huh
B	the gym
A	for God's sake
B	gotta get up and go to the gym
A	Don't wanna
B	I don't wanna go to the gym
A	uh-uh
B	my calves are still hurting so
A	still?
B	it's not gonna go well
A	mm
B	might go to the cinema
A	mm?
B	did you say?
A	zumba
B	oh
A	mm
B	I want Zumba
A	really?
B	mm
A	does that mean being in the water at like seven A M though?
B	half six
A	hmm
A	hmm
B	mm
A	you thought it was Thursday and so you were here for ten
B	mm
A	oh I see
A	did nine on a Friday
B	no
A	if you're on early
B	if I should start at eight
A	mm
B	then I always start at eight
A	mm
B	then on a Friday I I start at nine
B	but I am supposed to go in at ten on Friday
A	why?
B	Cos I'm on lates this week
A	yeah but you just said if you're on lates then on a Friday you go in at nine
B	no if I'm on at
A	if you start at eight then you go in at eight
B	oh yeah
A	then you go in at nine
B	that's what I mean
A	I thought am I losing my mind?
A	huh
B	yeah

A	that would be quite annoying
B	sometimes
A	okay
B	but the thing is it's okay until someone says how do you spell this? And I can't tell them
B	Cos I can't get the B E C A U is that right A U S E?
A	yeah
B	and if someone spells something to me wait wait wait wait wait

A	phonetic spelling's quite a recent thing

B	oh do they?
A	at school that's not how they used to teach us

A	yeah
A	spelling out loud

B	I
A	right
B	loads of them
A	maybe it's just maybe like a
B	mm
A	both mentally and you know emotionally
B	maybe
A	maybe it's something to do with that
B	mm
A	like my parents bought me a watch like a toy watch and we used to tell the time
B	yeah
A	test you on stuff like that and help you
B	mm
A	and if you're not getting that sort of stimulus at home maybe that's why
B	yeah
A	your brain is like that
B	I guess
A	you struggle a little bit like that
B	yeah
A	Don't know
B	goodness
A	yeah
B	but it came out this weekend
A	mm

A	mm
B	Don't know why

A	mm
B	and then get up for the first what time's the
A	the first one is six forty
B	six forty
A	which is a mother bitch
B	and then there's seven ten
A	and they get you in at like ten to
B	I'm gonna have to sit and work out my clocks
A	God
B	I can't do that in my head
A	well hang on
B	and then
A	and then work out for an hour
B	I get an hour
A	eight thirty
B	do you think?
A	yeah
B	then I'd be in the gym and ready to go for eight
A	the thing is by that point you've said the bus sometimes goes a bit shit
B	yeah
A	with the timing
B	so
A	and then at least knowing you're there
B	Seven forty
A	Seven ten
B	Seven ten
A	because seven forty you'll get caught up in the school traffic
B	yep
A	mm
B	I've left my trackies and stuff at work
A	mhm
B	yep
A	shower
B	the worst part is
A	wash your hair
B	whenever you go to the gym in the morning like all the people that are allowed to use the gym I E the hotel and all the John Lewis staff
A	mhm
B	come in
A	they're all  they're all  in
B	and work out
A	mm
B	it's me and like three guys
A	hench
B	yeah
A	mhm
B	I'm dying of death
A	yeah
B	and
A	they're not looking at you
B	and it's so funny
A	mm
B	and you can see them eyeing me up a bit
A	mm
B	and it's the funniest thing
A	mm
B	completely different person
A	mm
B	bright red
A	mm
B	and you're thinking ha ha you didn't see that coming did you?
A	mm
A	I think but I think blokes
B	gutted
A	blokes quite like it actually
B	mm
A	I mean presumably unless you're doing er some crazy acrobatics in the
B	yeah
A	I dunno
A	but um
B	like when I run it would
A	it's when it's in the hair as well isn't it
B	it's the worst
A	that makes me really upset
B	it is the worst isn't it
A	yeah
B	it's the worst
A	wuh
B	I'm gonna have to and I'm gonna google running shoes as well
A	mm
B	Cos I'm not spending a load of money on running shoes
A	well no
B	oh yeah
A	mm
B	I think
A	that's cheap
B	cos there's a lot of the what's that running make? I
A	asics? Yeah
B	asics
A	yeah
B	whatever that is
A	mm
B	well they're about eighty quid a pair
A	are they?
B	mm
A	oh
B	but a lot of
A	I thought they were like the chav one
B	no
A	ah
B	but um a lot of places do them half price
A	mm
B	and I'm also thinking if I can find children's ones
A	yeah
B	I can rock that
A	mm
B	so I think I'm gonna have a bit of a google and find out
A	can you get the ones with lights?
B	oh probably if I
B	I'd totally choose the ones with lights
A	very easily
B	with all the men?
A	actually
B	with the lights
A	yeah
B	check this  check this
A	they might think you were a bit of a Barbie
A	yes
B	but they're gonna think I'm a bit of a Barbie anyway
A	yeah but you'll be outrunning them
B	that will happen
A	that will certainly be happening
B	I mean I wouldn't start putting money on it
A	no come on  come on  I'm rooting
A	it's hip hop happening
B	hip hop happening
A	yep
B	have a look at some running shoes as well I think and then
A	yeah
B	Bedfordshire forever
A	uh
A	muh
B	aw
A	thank the Lord
B	can we take this? Cos I've not got a bell
A	I think they might notice
B	oh
A	I realized that when I was in the bike shop the guy was looking at me strangely cos I kept referring to my bike as she
A	I was like oh yeah she could do with a bit of a clean and are you gonna look after her? And because obviously she's a female
B	well yeah
A	I think at first he was like God she probably must not have meant that
B	yeah
A	Cos I sort of obviously refer to
B	yeah
A	a personality
B	yeah
A	mhm
A	spend
B	yes
A	huh
B	I mean usually I would defend any purchasing of the garments
A	but I need them
B	you are
A	because the wedding
B	mm
A	and the skirt I need because I need to wear something nice on Friday
B	maybe I need to try my dress on and see how it fits now
A	yeah
B	but I've only worn my
A	yeah but we need a new one
B	hats
A	diamonique
B	hats
A	mm
B	I love hats
A	and Swarovski crystals that we can stick on our face
B	yes
A	lovely
B	swirls
A	oh God do you have to drawn it on?
B	well you an a makeup artist would
A	yeah
B	so like you put it on and it all like graffiti round your face
A	I need that in my life
B	and I figure you know just fringe at one side
A	mm
B	graffiti eye part covered by the fringe
A	mm
A	sounds normal
B	sounds completely normal
A	or see you again
A	so that's fine
B	yes
A	it's no biggie
B	no
A	because we don't we won't really mind
B	we can probably survive
A	yeah
B	so
A	probably what's gonna happen
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	I can't remember how big I was last time I wore it
B	I don't recall
A	can you remember what size it is?
B	yes it's
A	mhm
B	Cos I remember the boobage
A	right
B	it's the boobage I'm concerned about
A	well that's alright then isn't it
B	yeah
A	the dress should still fit
B	but my shape's really different now
A	but your shape is different
B	so it might not look as hot
A	well that's why God invented sashes
B	and leather jackets
A	corsages
B	and under-garments
A	and big
B	and big hats
A	to detract from anything else
B	yes
A	massive hats
B	do you think I can wear my hooker heels to the wedding?
A	what's well can you do the dress?
B	what?
A	can you get the dress?
B	now?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	oh that's so nice
B	really lovely
A	oh that's lush
B	hm
A	I'd forgotten about that
B	I think the boobage will fit in
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	it's really pretty
B	but um I think I need to wear it
A	mhm
B	and the hooker heels will keep it off the floor
A	yeah
B	I don't remember
A	hmm
B	but um
A	but the hooker heels
B	the problem is
A	walking
B	I don't wanna fall over in the hooker heels
A	yep
B	yep
A	party bus from the wedding to the reception
B	well that's fine
A	so really I mean er dancing might be a bit of an issue this being a wedding and all
B	oh
A	um
B	mm
A	but apart from that I mean the heels can just come off can't they
B	yeah
A	by that point no one'll be standing
B	yeah
A	everyone'll be lying down
B	and actually they're quite comfortable
A	yeah
B	hurting your feet
A	oh I wouldn't advise dancing on them
B	no
A	right
B	round the place
A	right
B	but I need some new liners for them
A	yeah
B	insoles
A	mm
B	should've got a five
A	mm
B	even though I had the opportunity to
A	that's probably better though isn't it really
B	yeah
A	bigger is better
B	the liners will keep the cushty cushty cushty
A	cushty
B	right so
A	okay
B	I can wear hooker heels
A	oh
B	parade
A	before the event
B	A parade
A	parade
B	the fashion parade
A	yep
A	mm
B	um which it sounds a bit
A	mhm
B	and the reason that I'm thinking army guy is they're buff
A	mhm
B	they're really lad-like men
A	mm
B	yob types
A	mm
B	and they're posted somewhere else and I don't have to get involved with them for long
A	mm
B	which sounds awful
A	I mean if it's a use and abuse
B	but
A	type situation then it's fine isn't it
B	I think that's wise
A	I don't know how you go about shopping for one of those
B	I do
A	ah
B	I mean if I write on the profile only army men please
A	that I think that's fine
A	I don't think that's um sort of you know sexism but for army men er then I think that's probably fine
B	or RAF
A	there's enough of them on there
B	you know
A	yep
A	Cos then then they've gotta be clever
B	looking for officer slash gentleman
A	yep
B	officer not gentleman
A	officer not gentleman
B	mm
A	Don't want that
B	no
A	man in uniform
B	yep
A	enquiries please
B	yes
A	no
B	so
A	no there will be no entering into love affairs
B	no
A	yep
B	and as soon as it  as soon as it  gets to the point of ooh actually I
A	he goes
B	cut them off
A	yep
B	cut them off dead and ship them out
A	yeah
B	to wherever they're posted to
A	yep
B	I think it's the only option
A	Germany turns out
B	yeah
A	um
B	I still wanna know if he's gone there yet
A	mm
B	I might find out
A	yeah
B	mm
A	why not?
B	but er yeah
A	oh I like it  I like it  a as a master plan
