A	so what do you think is one of the most important key responsibilities or competencies involved in the job?
B	an an understanding of what multimedia is and showing I'm I've gotta show um my experience in different
A	and what? What like multimedia being
B	being audio um podcasting video
A	mm
B	um websites an understanding of websites I guess
A	well well you said  well you said  that you'd been looking at it on a regular basis for a long time haven't you?
B	exactly
A	and what what kind of stuff do they put on their websites? Is it about their projects?
B	it's it's about their
A	mm
B	they would have some of the audio of a a discussion that was held or something like that
A	mm
B	but that I think that links into accountability
A	well you've got  you've got  experience in radio broadcasting and social network media haven't you
B	well I worked at um I've worked at two
A	when was that?
B	that was when I was trying to get a job at the BBC
A	was that in
B	it was all over the place
A	ah cool
B	I just did a few I think I did about five or ten
A	ah
A	mm mm
B	um so that was really good
B	mm about five six years but
A	but isn't it transferable?
B	it is transferable but it's completely different software
A	yeah
B	and editing stills is er editing sorry visuals is is very different to just having one line of audio
A	mm
B	yeah I mean I think  I think  also that um you know it's about I think in some ways you're right they're transferable skills because it's about story boarding it thinking about what you know what is it gonna look like as an entire piece
A	mm mm
B	but I think also a big part of the roll is actually devising some of the teams about what they could do
A	where would the team?
B	yeah teams in different countries
A	and how do they get that out there through radio and TV or internet or all of them?
B	they're all different projects in different countries
A	oh cool
B	they'll you know pay for the  for the  place of the studios the equipment
A	ah and you'd be in charge of like the um training the people there too
B	I'd I'd be there to help and advise them but also I'd be my main responsibility I think would be to get them to make material that I could then that could then go on the website
A	that sounds like your perfect job it really does
B	exactly it sounds really good
A	and they given an given you an idea of how much travel is involved?
B	no it's mostly based in London it's saying but it it asks for an ability or willingness to travel to Asia and Africa
A	what are the countries?
B	um Iraq
A	right so Somalia is when the whole sort of
B	yeah exactly
A	part of the job description
B	but that's a good question actually
A	yeah
B	not in an application form question
A	true
B	what do you think?
A	no definitely cos you don't
B	and I can also say that I've travelled extensively um particularly in India
A	and you've trained people and
B	I've trained people and I've worked abroad
A	mm
B	yeah exactly
A	so that's that kind of covers that base
B	um and I've travelled
A	I did the Cambodia thing
B	yeah you know
A	yeah
B	and that I've visited developing countries and um you know cos for some people it's not an easy thing to go to a developing country
A	well that's what I was saying about this job in Thailand
B	yeah
A	I mean I know it's not that much of a
B	exactly
A	so
B	exactly um so and you know I haven't lived in India but I've been there for like I went that time for about six weeks or something
A	yeah
B	which I think is a a pretty solid period of time
A	definitely and you've lived
B	about three years
A	that shows that you've lived in a different culture and
B	exactly
A	and worked
B	exactly
A	and learnt the language and
B	yeah
A	so
B	I'm just wondering whether there could be something in there about thinking about India and travelling and Cambodia and travelling but like when we were in Cambodia we went to a lot of kind of social projects and that kind of stuff
A	definitely
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	um so yeah you know you've just gotta go for these things really haven't you?
A	definitely
B	mm
A	I think is probably quite important
B	oh yeah and having to find people speak to them convince them to do radio so that's all about communication
A	and creative thinking
B	that's something I need to talk about creative thinking
A	definitely but not only the creative thinking but to be able to transform those ideas into practical reality
B	yeah cos that's
A	on the application
B	that's exactly what that question is about isn't it
A	what about editorial judgement? I guess that's
B	yeah but I have to have editorial judgement because the piece that you know I have to be making it in an editorial way
A	mm
B	so people in the  I'll talk to them about how they so the story how to balance it how to that kind of stuff
A	mm
B	so um it
A	yeah
B	yeah I think so
A	in a short paragraph
B	mm
A	um health and safety
B	well yeah I think it's quite a consideration because if the projects are in developing countries obviously um and not just developing countries in terms of poverty but also often in politically unstable countries
A	oh okay
B	so you have to have an understanding
A	right
B	they can't go out at
A	I was thinking more along the lines of don't put your cup of tea too close to your laptop
B	well that's also important as well
A	mm
B	so
A	yeah well it seems that you've got
B	oh yeah yeah
A	Cos I could
B	I did apply for it actually
A	well it didn't have media
B	it was I think it was a press officey job or something
A	oh I guess that's quite media related isn't it?
B	just selling press selling stuff to press really
A	ee
B	well
A	with you?
B	it I don't think
A	they're flexible
B	they're flexible
A	haven't you  haven't you  got any friends down there you could crash on their floors?
B	this is it We've got I've got friends and stuff that I could ask and also
A	have you have your has your brother still got the flat in London? Or is he renting it out?
B	he's still got the house but as far as I know all the rooms are rented out
A	or sleep in the bath
B	or sleep in the bath
A	yeah true
B	I don't  I don't  see that as a big issue and
A	ooh
B	probably I don't know anything about the salary
A	that would be cool
B	but even even say er I had to commute at the beginning it is only one and a half hours on the train to London and you know plenty of people from
A	Wendy does it yeah quite a lot doesn't she?
B	exactly
A	then it
B	exactly
A	yeah but they will probably assume that you are based in
B	oh yeah you're right  you're right  so they wouldn't really need to
A	then again I mean if you're thinking about commuting three days a week you'd probably save
B	yeah it's true
A	where's
B	she's in
A	hmm
B	so you know
A	hmm
B	from now
A	but so they pay to put him up when he's there?
B	yeah he gets paid
A	oh cool
A	it'll be doable definitely
B	yeah
A	are you still thinking of er buying a place up here though if?
B	yeah I think we'll still buy somewhere here so we'll still
A	it would be
B	exactly work in  work in  London and get a bit of the London vibe
A	mm
B	for a few days of the week and um it's a bit more exciting I think to work in London
A	definitely it's more things are more creative
B	yeah
A	you just check what's on and
B	yeah definitely
A	mm
B	I'm just going to concentrate on it stage by stage and you know if if I get an interview that's brilliant
A	yep I think that's important
B	exactly
A	and maybe collaborate on a freelance
B	even ask just to shadow
A	yeah
B	so you know whoever did get this job offer to shadow or
A	could you not get an attachment? If you
B	it has to be advertised
A	oh
B	um
A	do you know anyone else who's applying for it?
B	no
A	shh top secret
B	although it is on a web you know on the website so we'll see what happens
A	yeah fine
B	oh no I take I'm taking ages
A	no
B	it's a job to get a job
A	yeah
B	it's pretty hard nowadays applying for jobs
A	well I just think it's yeah it's it's even more important cos there are so many people going for the jobs it's even more important to get your job application and your CV and your covering letter to
B	it's like
A	to convey exactly what you
B	what they say
A	mm
B	you know what is it? There's got to be something in there that shines out
A	yeah
B	what is it? So
A	definitely but I found cos you have to write it in quite a formal tone
B	yeah yeah
A	it's quite difficult to convey that when you're still trying to follow the the formality of the
B	yeah yeah
A	I love your company
B	you know it's understanding like the brand or whatever it is and showing that you understand it
A	mm
B	um you know saying why you're passionate about it
A	mm
B	it's a good question because I think I have put it
A	innit as in?
B	isn't it
A	okay
B	um that's that obviously that's not gonna go on the final edit but um er I think I've put somewhere that I have also had a passion for the work
A	oh that's okay
B	and I've talked about how I've always you know I've been aware of their work for a long time
A	mm
B	looking at ways for promoting the stories for the audiences I work with
A	mm
B	so yeah you know
A	mm
B	mm
A	it's very difficult to put yourself over on paper
B	sometimes but sometimes interviews can be a complete nightmare
A	oh God yeah I'm a shivering wreck in interviews
A	thirty odd people um helps you develop those skills of not not minding so much being in the focus and
B	exactly you know and I mean what I don't like about interviews is or the interviews I've been to most recently is that kind of feeling as you walk in and there's a panel of people say three or four
A	mm
B	and you're just it's it's kind of weird
A	mm
B	because it means that they're taking notes and and obviously you've said something right
A	nowadays isn't it all about ticking boxes though and not actually writing
B	yeah that's true ticking
A	tick tick cross
B	but um I went for this one job where I had to go for three interviews
A	three?
B	yeah
A	that's a bit excessive
B	I know
A	what were they three separate occasions or three?
B	three separate occasions
A	oh wow
B	yeah
A	I was surprised at the different that it's very task-based a lot of interviews nowadays
B	yeah yeah
A	um
B	oh no
A	and obviously you don't want
B	exactly
A	hmm
B	you know
A	but those are kind of questions that you can prepare for
B	so what have you done when have you been in a situation where you can't answer the question?
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	and did you get the job?
A	well I got offered the assistant position of the job
B	oh well that's alright
A	but I think that's because I
B	oh right that's why they handed you the assistant
A	I've
B	managing people
A	I can't remember what the question was that they asked me that I couldn't that I didn't know how to answer
B	I don't like it already
A	no I can't remember exactly what the wording was but no when when I didn't have any knowledge of that question because I had no previous experience in the field
B	I think that when you answer as being honest is good
A	yeah true
B	it's like actually you know I don't know this but I would  I would  go and research it
A	I'd say it is the ability to think on your feet isn't it
B	yeah and then afterwards I always like to ask at least two or three questions cos they always say have you got any questions? And I I don't know I always feel weird if I don't so
A	mm
B	yeah that's a good one
A	oh I might write that down actually
B	I really like you
A	I could work with you
B	what about in Spain? Did you go for interviews in Spain? Or was that a different process?
A	no
B	yeah
A	Cos in Spain it's kind of a teacher training factory isn't it
B	when can you start and
A	mm
B	I once did one and I they put me on speaker phone
A	oh no
B	and um I just found it really bizarre because I didn't know I
A	what? What was that for?
B	it was for I applied for some funding to go to Trinidad
A	ah yeah yeah
B	and um I got it ironically
A	well the only phone interview I've got i he he I think he was so desperate for people that he he just wanted to make sure I could make a coherent sentence and
B	ah
A	but yeah I know I thought it was gonna be interview and it was just basically so when can you start?
