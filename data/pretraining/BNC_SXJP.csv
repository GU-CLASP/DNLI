A	so
B	yeah
B	well
A	they could repossess the house and
B	yeah I mean it's fourteen days after the fourteenth of December so it wouldn't be like we have to get out on the fourteenth so I mean
A	no no but I'd
B	it would all we'd still stay at the same sort of to move out but
A	yeah ring her tomorrow maybe maybe they'll be like fuck
B	yeah
A	mm
B	I'd imagine so but then she's got a copy of it as well
A	it would be so cool if like oh yeah shit don't pay your rent next month they wouldn't say that obviously we'd still have to pay but yeah mm how scandalous
B	just stupid and it's like
A	that's that's really bad like
B	yeah
A	to not pay why would you what's the point of renting out your house
B	then to yeah to then not to pay the mortgage
A	to then not pay your mortgage? like
B	that's really sort of it's
A	that's really stupid
B	really stupid isn't it?
A	it doesn't even make any logical sense it's not like you you you even need the money like
B	no
A	the money from the rent of the house should pretty much
B	that's it
A	go to pay off the mortgage
B	mortgage yeah
A	that's the point of renting out your house
B	unless she's
A	maybe
B	very bad for her
A	yeah
B	I mean if she was that much of a dedicated landlady she would have
A	done more to look after it actually
B	spruced it up a bit yeah
A	yeah
B	I dunno
A	oh no
B	I'll ring them tomorrow and see what they say
A	yeah just ring and be like erm hello what does this mean?
B	just to let you know
A	but the thing is though she must be paying the estate agents
B	yeah I don't know how that works though and that's really really sneaky because of well I I did a bit of reading up on the internet after
A	yeah
B	so I guess some apparently some landlady or landlords say that they erm get new tenants in knowing that they might get their house repossessed so they can have that extra two months
A	oh
B	so they can like I dunno
A	how very peculiar
B	very peculiar
A	oh no oh well
B	means that can you imagine if we were gonna like carry on staying here?
A	I know
B	be like oh my god
A	how was your weekend? what happened to the
B	oh that was me that was before anybody even came
A	oh I see I was just like
B	erm yeah it was good like
A	what did you have just like a party?
B	not really about I think I had yeah four people came over four people from the pub
A	oh cool
B	we went into town it was very good actually
A	and you went into
B	yeah it was really fun
A	where did you go in
B	just the
A	it's good but in a dingy way it's pretty dingy
B	oh yeah but jesus I'm not going anywhere other than there cos it's so frigging expensive everywhere else
A	yeah yeah I know
B	so I was I really liked I thought it was really good
A	where did they stay? so over here?
B	yeah they stayed here
A	mm but er if you'd asked I could have erm you could have used my bed oh well
B	oh no it's fine honestly
A	mm
B	cos we've cos this cos there was only like five of us anyway
A	yeah
B	so
A	oh it was really good it was er put that over there it was really good erm very relaxed very chilled everything went according to plan I think
B	oh god
A	they they're the one that I really don't think she'd ever really be together
B	the ones that never have sex?
A	mm well apparently they have they do have sex now but apparently as far as like they've been together for they like as in like officially boyfriend and girlfriend since January he hasn't said that he loves her
B	mm
A	and don't get me wrong I don't think there is
B	maybe
A	yeah and like he's not head over heels in love with her and she keeps being like
B	what's he playing at?
A	yeah she's been like well why isn't he head over heels in love with me? I'm like
A	maybe you're just no but as horrible as it sounds maybe she's just not like the one like I don't believe in the one that concept but you know maybe she's just not
B	they're just not compatible
A	yeah I just it sounds horrible I just don't think he finds her attractive
B	is she head over heels heels in love with him?
A	yeah
B	oh no
B	I dunno
A	but does he tell you things like he thinks you're pretty?
B	no
A	really?
B	not really
A	mm
B	and that to be fair if if she thinks it's important and he knows that then he should make the effort
A	yeah like she has low self esteem she has this disability you know she already thinks that she's not a super well he isn't a supermodel
B	I'm sure if I told
A	erm
B	I guess
B	that's
A	so they spent the whole weekend arguing about that really him being like you never appreciate what I do you know I cooked you dinner last week and you don't care blah blah blah and she's like I do care you know it's really important to me and sometimes I just need you to tell me that you actually like me you know and that would reassure me and
B	mm
A	and it er and went I mean it er it
B	no
A	and I don't offer it's a really nice easy relationship you know
B	yeah
A	she knows what I think she knows that I don't particularly like him and he's the one on her birthday who got angry because I had said that he was shy and I didn't want him to be shy cos he was meeting like all her friends for the first time and was like you know I hear you're a bit er shy but don't worry and he got really angry at her
B	yeah I know I remember you saying that
A	erm so like I kind of think he's a bit of a twat anyway but
B	it didn't bother her too much?
A	no
B	that's good
A	cos through the weekend it didn't bother but then we got on the flight and she started to cry
B	ah
A	and then the moment we got back to the airport and obviously you get wifi and stuff her phone went off and it was him being like you know you're a bitch you know you don't appreciate me you know you just want me to say this but I'm not gonna say it until I'm ready and he isn't he's never gonna say it cos he's he just he just doesn't love her and it's really sad but she keeps like hoping that one day he will and
B	jesus
A	I drove from Gatwick to Oxford and then came back here
B	jesus
A	yes yes it was jesus
B	Jesus was not really helping you
A	I yeah so tired like cos she was really sweet she was like I'll give you petrol I'm like it's fine but she gave me she gave me thirty pounds she gave me for like the parking and for petrol and stuff which was
B	yeah
A	and we listened to music on the way home so but she just she just has that hope that they're gonna work and it's just like
B	mm give up the ghost now
A	yeah just like stop it and she was like oh well he said I could have gone over last night and I was like if you'd actually gone over to his house last night I think I would have like actually gotten angry at you after everything he said
B	yeah
A	and you were like okay I'll come over I said all you would have done is sat there and argued with each other
B	yeah
A	you know it wouldn't have been a nice evening you know like
B	yeah
A	they hoped that going from like best friends to a grey zone was suddenly gonna be like the best thing ever but it just
B	didn't work
A	yeah it just didn't turn out that way it wasn't they they weren't they're not compatible that's really sad but
B	it takes quite a lot to realise that I think doesn't it?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	I don't think you know
B	it's got it's got nothing to do with her
A	yeah it's not to do with her she will one day find somebody who is madly in love with her and makes her you know and says and like is the way she wants him to be and
B	yeah
A	says the things she wants him to say and you know like when she walks into a room he's like wow she's amazing but that isn't him it's just not
B	yeah
A	and the moment she realises that
B	unfortunately she's got to realise that on her own
B	yeah
A	that's fine
B	yeah
A	do you want a cup of tea?
B	yeah
A	but oh
B	erm
B	yeah it's fine but
A	same old same old
B	how come you're back late are you?
A	I'm
B	oh
A	yeah erm there's a cupcake for you
B	right
A	she made er salted caramel cupcakes
B	oh
A	so there's one
B	I am well down for that
A	in
A	she was like do you wanna take one for the road? I was like yes and then she was I was like can
A	they're so good and they and they've got like melted caramel in the middle as well
B	oh brilliant
A	so you bite into them and you're just like
B	I am well down for that
A	I'm so excited
A	oh don't worry
B	that's your one
A	I don't mind
B	coming up
A	you bitch
A	I'll have what milky tea not milky tea strong tea I'll just add some milk
B	oh also I'm running out of space in all fairness
B	how did it go?
A	oh really well and she was like you're brilliant and great and we love you and blah blah blah
B	yay
A	she says you're very confident and you're er for such a young person you're very confident and everybody has respect for you and
B	woohoo
A	I said that's great but you know like when you
B	yes
A	gives you praise
B	I I don't take praise very well
A	I don't I no I don't think many people do take praise very well
B	it's really hard to take praise
A	yeah cos you don't wanna come across as smug do you?
B	no
A	but you don't wanna come across as like
A	yeah exactly
B	praise
A	being like oh don't you know don't
B	yeah oh shut up
A	oh shut up you charmer
B	no
A	so but it had my boss and my new boss in there so
B	okay that's good
A	yeah
A	so was good to hear like for him obviously to hear good things about me
B	yes always helps
A	mm but how was your work? oh
B	yeah we do I had mine in August but and it was fine
A	how's
B	fine
A	it's alright shattered don't worry as well I'm absolutely I'm gonna eat this and probably have like a really early night to be honest
A	I know I
B	and won't be able to sleep again
A	not be able to sleep so I was like what can I do what can I do? and
B	yes it will
A	it'll stop me from falling asleep
B	erm have you put down money on that place yet?
A	no they got back to me but they erm the landlord wanted somebody who could move in sooner
B	oh
A	but actually it's still
B	er yeah
A	he's coming here
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	okay
A	cool
B	erm
A	yeah
B	I doubt very much
A	no
B	erm
A	maybe just ask be like erm so what do we do in terms of payment then? or something like
B	cos she's she's not paying for her mortgage so
A	cos she's not paying for her mortgage
B	so we're not paying for
A	so
B	does your you know when you pay the rent does it go into an account?
A	it goes to the estate agent
B	does it? does it go I was wondering whether it went straight into her
A	it's I put it into exactly the same account as what we put the deposit into
B	but could that not be her account?
A	could be
B	cos that's why
A	true
B	mm who have we been paying?
A	yeah maybe just like maybe it's like we we who are we actually paying?
B	yeah
A	like we're feeling slightly uncomfortable now
B	yeah what are we funding?
A	her drug habit
B	probably
A	I no longer feel comfortable funding this
A	I'm not paying any more
B	but we're staying here
A	but see what they say tomorrow just be like
B	let's just say yeah we don't feel comfortable
A	yeah
B	in so many words
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	cos like you know obviously this is there's something going very wrong here financially
B	what are we paying for?
A	what are we paying for? like can you before we pay our next rent or something can you please speak to the landlord about this?
B	yeah
A	cos obviously our next rent's due next week
B	or we could just say
A	no she's contractually bound to not get us kicked out
B	true
A	I think maybe just play it like we're
B	yeah
A	paying until we
B	what's actually going on like
A	or what's actually happening yeah like we're uncomfortable with the situation and we'd rather have it sorted out before we
B	that means we're technically not paying for this house
A	yeah we're technically not paying for this house so maybe just swing it that way just be like we're uncomfortable paying continuing to pay for this until we know where that money had actually gone or whether it's so that there's a
A	financial
B	it would make sense if it
A	yeah
B	why would they why would it direct itself back? either I mean it would be like
A	yeah
B	pointless almost wouldn't it?
A	yeah definitely it's a bit it's just weird I think yeah just sell it that way cos er maybe she
B	cos a mortgage is not eight hundred pound a month is it?
A	no and just with like the er the threat of being kicked out I'm sorry
B	no
A	it's not really good enough is it? so maybe just sell it that way
B	I'm gonna ring
A	the yeah like she should just we don't feel particularly comfortable erm paying continuing to pay our rent until we understand like what's happening
B	yeah
A	yeah really I'm really uncomfortable because and if you say it like you know this is like our money you know it's like
A	it's a lot of money
B	yeah
B	we could be selling her her drug dealer you know
A	we could be funding that that poor you know woman's
B	a trafficked woman
A	she could be like running a factory shop in Russia
A	for all we
B	let's just get really carried away
A	yeah
B	start crying
A	start being like you know we just we just hate where this is going
A	yeah so
B	okay
A	so like that along those lines
B	I'll I'll try
A	see what she says yeah
B	er yeah
A	makes you feel sorry for the couple moving in though
B	oh god I know
A	cos that's really dodgy
B	that's horrible
A	oh
B	what?
A	oh they'd better ensure our deposits
B	oh shit yeah
A	cos that money
B	what's
A	we don't even know where that's money's gone if that money's gone into a different account that we don't actually know and she hasn't and she's in debt
B	yeah
A	like that's eight hundred quid of our money that is in
B	I'm sure we pay more than that
A	yeah also what I think
B	it's not
A	maybe that's something worth mentioning as well actually
B	yeah
A	that's on a serious notes that's our money
B	that's
A	sitting in her
B	yeah
A	account
B	yes
A	and she's in debt
B	but you but the
A	that should be
B	of the circumstances because
A	it should be yeah
B	that's not that's not our fault is it?
A	no no not at all but if she's in debt then
B	yeah
A	the government can claim anything they can take any of
B	yeah
A	her finances can't they? so
B	exactly
A	you wanna make sure that's erm ensured
B	do we know how much deposit we pay? I haven't even got my document here
A	we pay something like I paid something like twelve hundred didn't I?
B	yeah
A	but I think two hundred and fifty of that was an admin bill wasn't it?
B	oh yeah we had admi I think let me just have a look
A	yeah no on a serious note I suddenly just thought about that I was like shit that's our deposit
B	no you're very right
A	no
B	maybe it was contract
A	I mean how stupid would you have to be to not pay the mortgage? like
B	I know
A	yeah
B	oh it's on the erm internet isn't it?
A	yeah it was an e-contract yeah
B	I'll find it on that
A	yeah
B	I've got sixteen hundred in my account for some reason that's that'll be eight hundred pounds rent and
A	yeah it might have been
B	it was a month's rent and
A	mm
B	but I wonder if I think it's only only eight hundred pounds I think
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	the deposit but we had to pay more the upfront
B	the upfront yeah
A	yeah
B	so it would be eight hundred pound I'll say that
A	but that's maybe that's why she was but she was like rushing to get people in it wasn't she?
B	I know
A	mm
B	and needed to have people in so that she had that
A	mm either way I don't feel particularly comfortable about it
B	no I don't but she can't say that we've opened her mail like this was to the tenant or occupier so we are the tenant and occupier this is just a notice I think to make us aware of what's going on
A	mm
A	mm
B	we'd we'd be kicked out ultimately
A	you have fifteen minutes to get your stuff what?
A	take me out dead or alive you will never have my stuff
B	what a mouthful
A	mm
B	mm
A	good that
B	very handy
A	how much did she charge you for that five minute conversation?
A	bitch
B	quite handy she asks me for a well not this year but very often has mental health advice but we sort of bouncing back each other
A	mm
B	info for info
A	I can imagine that being a lawyer is a very stressful job so
B	mm
A	oh
B	but yeah
A	I was just stand I don't know I don't know I'm just standing
B	I was a
A	oh god
B	I mean it
A	true
A	whatever
B	okay
A	love you
B	bye oh I'm not I'm not
