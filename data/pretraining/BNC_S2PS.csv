A	I have I have a problem with my password on there and
B	oh yes
A	and I can't really get on it
B	quite right
C	yeah
A	or see
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	but it can be used for good or bad
C	I I think like anything in life it can be
A	it can
C	I I'm a bit of an addict
A	er I know
C	I very rarely go on the internet and I don't check Facebook
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	I think you have to be a lot more careful with what you're actually posting on there these days
B	yeah
A	Don't they
C	yeah
A	and
C	absolutely
A	especially do you know to do with the you know racist
C	you have to be careful
A	they have
C	you know whether or not that's wrong but you just don't put it on do you
A	no
C	you can think it but you don't put it on in black and white
A	no
C	somebody can say well you said that about
A	mm
C	your manager
B	yeah if you wouldn't stick it on your noticeboard
C	yeah
B	in your office why would you stick it on Facebook?
A	yeah that's the test really isn't it
B	because you've got less chance of seeing it if it's stuck on a wall in your office
C	probably yeah
A	that should be the test really
B	yeah
A	you know if you wouldn't actually do that in person
B	stick it on a wall by your desk
A	then why would you feel that you could do that
B	stick it on Facebook
A	um
C	mhm
A	out of your system or you're thinking you're getting something out of your system
B	mm
A	at somebody
C	mm
A	you're actually putting it down on there but thinking thinking in a way that it's personal but it's not
C	and it's open to
A	it's really public
C	anybody who's on your friends list
B	yeah
C	some people's profiles are just open
A	mm
C	you know you can click them even if you have absolutely no idea who they are
A	mm
C	you can click them
B	yeah yeah
A	mm
C	and look up things about them
A	do do you think it's um sort of people are made aware of it enough to know? You know what's going on in terms of security settings and things like that or not?
C	I
A	is it people choose not to know some of that sometimes?
C	I think there are some people who are ignorant of it
A	yeah
C	and just don't know that you can go into privacy settings
B	mm
C	and change things
A	mm
C	see who you can view
A	mm
C	um perhaps who can view different parts of your profile
B	mm
C	and nobody else
A	is is it quite clear that you can do that? You know is it
C	well
A	within the the website kind of thing? Do they make do they make that quite clear that you can do that?
C	I I think it's moderately it's clear to an extent but I can sort of see why some people wouldn't
A	mm
C	if they
B	mm
C	don't read the small print
A	mm
B	yeah
C	it's not like they're in big block letters
A	mm
C	look at your privacy settings
A	right
C	um it's something I'd look into but not everybody who uses it will
A	no
C	and er
A	do you have an account on um?
B	I'm not on Facebook
A	you're not on at all?
B	no
A	and have no desire to?
B	no I wanna be the last person in the world not on Facebook
A	you you sorry you want to be the last person in the world
B	yes
C	yeah yeah that's er that's really good
A	right so that's a it's an ambition I suppose isn't it
C	mm
B	I'm on LinkedIn
A	I know you are
B	because I get invites from people
A	yeah
B	that you you meet through work
A	mm
C	mm
B	so I've got the most skeletal profile on
C	mm
B	there
A	right
C	yeah
A	oh so you
B	just yeah
A	you are on it in a fashion but
B	yeah
A	not a very
C	yeah
A	right
B	I mean I don't have any interest in
A	no
B	telling people things about myself
A	no
C	no
B	I'd rather make up lies
A	well you you could have you that that some people you know Facebook allows them to do that you know
C	well it does it does
B	yeah
C	I mean
A	yeah
B	I know it does
C	yeah absolutely
A	yeah
C	I mean you know I mean
B	and blogs that I used for flights of fantasy
C	yeah
B	although they're roughly based in reality
A	yeah
B	but that's completely anonymous
C	oh right
A	right
B	yeah
C	it's a
B	yeah
A	well we all need to do that
C	yeah
A	yeah we all need to do that
B	mm
A	but I I as I say I think some people do see it as a almost a faceless
B	mm
A	thing that they just it it
C	mm
A	they they they sort of um what's the word? The they sort of they
C	anonymous?
A	they don't feel
B	yeah
C	I think that's the right word
A	yeah I mean they feel like it's not they're not accountable for it
B	mm
A	at all
A	they feel they don't have to be accountable for it in any way shape or form
B	mm
C	that's the problem
A	but that's changing a bit
B	yeah
A	with um some of these cases up this week about some people put racist comments on
C	mm
A	twitter
C	yeah yeah
A	and actually like we you know to
A	you can see it as a criminal offence can't you
C	yeah
A	you could end up in jail for it
C	yeah
A	you know
C	that's it
B	yeah
A	whereas previously I think they were a bit more hidden from that
B	mm
A	and they could get away with it more
C	yeah
A	it couldn't be tracked the same
C	it's almost seen as it's not in the real world
A	no
C	it's not it's not real either I just it's just on Facebook
B	yeah
A	it's just a virtual world
C	yeah I don't I don't you know I'm not bothered about that you know
B	mm
C	increasingly they do
A	oh it's all it's not just the university
C	yeah I probably wouldn't have thought that a few years ago
B	mm
C	and it's really taken off
A	well lots of businesses
C	so it's not
B	yeah
A	are making money now that way
C	yeah
A	they advertise that way
B	yeah
A	way of them marketing products
B	yeah
A	they will do that
C	mm
A	before they will put any
C	they target you with ads on Facebook as well
B	yeah
C	going down the page
A	mm
C	and
B	mm
A	when I used to when I used to go on it that even annoyed me then
C	yeah
A	kind of thing
C	yeah
A	but it would get in the way of what I would want to use Facebook for
C	absolutely
A	um
B	mhm
A	wealth of information in one area
C	it can be
A	data overload or information overload
B	yeah
A	I would call it
C	mm
A	but so Facebook in a way is faceless isn't it
C	well it it's
A	because
C	it can be
B	are you dissing his
A	sorry
C	no it's right
A	I I was just playing devil's advocate here aren't I really but
C	it's well it it's I don't know that it is faceless
B	you know the people on it
C	you know the people
A	yeah and
C	you can choose not to put a profile picture
A	yeah
C	thing
A	yeah
C	as Anne did on her LinkedIn one
B	mm
C	a very basic profile in
B	mm
C	I mean I explained that to one of my friends
A	mm
C	and he goes oh I don't think I'd want to have all that
B	mm
C	basic profile on
A	mm
C	you don't have to put a picture on
B	yeah
C	it could be just very basic
A	or what time you clean your teeth
C	you know you know it's not
B	yeah
C	it's not of interest really
A	what time you clean your teeth
C	I'm going to bed now
B	yeah
A	what time you put your pyjamas on
A	I suppose it's a bit like being on a mobile phone on a bus
C	oh
A	and telling somebody
B	mm
A	I'm on the
B	well that's alright if you're meant to be meeting them
A	yeah I know
C	yeah
A	but you hear it sometimes and it makes you cringe
B	yeah
A	it feels like for sake of sake kind of thing
C	yeah
B	and the thing I noticed on the Metrolink is the people lie about how close they are
C	yeah
B	I'm just coming into Sale now and you think you're not you've just left St Peter's Square you lying little
A	there might be a reason why they're lying though
B	yeah but
C	yeah that's right but
C	but they
B	they will always
A	right
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	they're actually pretending to be ten minutes closer than they are
A	you should pick them up on it some time
C	yeah
A	you should say
C	yeah
A	I suppose it's related in a way isn't it
B	yeah
C	yeah yeah yeah
A	because it's all connected isn't it
C	mm
A	shared so much quicker these days
B	I have a theory that it's just made everyone shameless
A	shameless?
C	ah
A	ah that that's a better word than faceless maybe
C	yes
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	shameless yeah
B	Cos I'm of an age where people kept things a bit private
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	yeah
B	we didn't discuss everything
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	and you didn't
C	yeah
B	spill all your personal details
A	no
C	yeah
B	what you had for tea or
C	yeah
A	like in general is it sort of or can be seen in a way as sort of attention seeking as well?
C	well it
A	and and we're in like the age of celebrity
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	you know and when Andy Warhol said everybody'd be famous for fifteen minutes
C	fifteen minutes
A	or whatever
B	someone that you had lamb chops for your tea
A	you might feel that
B	that's not great claim to fame though
A	is being
C	yeah
A	like to some people
C	yeah
A	that oh sort of like people wanna know this
C	yeah
A	I I feel good about this
C	mm
A	I've brushed my teeth at half past nine at night or whatever it is
C	I mean yeah I I mean
A	I dunno
C	I read that and I think well you know whyever did you put that on? If if I put something on I would hope it's of interest to people
B	mm
C	on holiday
A	well that's a bit different ain't it
C	you know I've met someone today you know a er
A	yeah
C	it might be sort of someone you've not
A	yeah
C	seen for a while
A	yeah
C	you know I had a great time
A	that's a bit different
C	I wouldn't say well I had I had a packet of chips
A	yeah
C	when I went home
A	no
C	I mean it's just not of interest to anyone
A	it's very mundane that
C	yeah
A	and it's very routine
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	in its own way
B	mhm
A	between the two
C	yeah
A	and meeting up with them
C	yeah
A	is the same to some people as saying I brushed my teeth at ten o'clock at night
C	yeah
A	Cos they've just put it on Facebook
B	maybe the people who tweet about brushing their teeth just don't clean their teeth very often
A	maybe not
B	or if they
A	Cos they're tweeting instead of cleaning their teeth
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	you've gotta worry
C	that's right
A	because er go back to Twitter for a minute
C	A hundred and forty characters
A	right
C	is sort of
A	wouldn't be a good idea for me to go on there then
C	but it's like it's more like slightly less than a text message
B	mm
C	and maybe that's one reason why I've got the account but I haven't really taken to it
A	right
C	you put all these little hash tags
B	yeah
C	all link with people
A	Cos there was a talk a while ago it might become more popular than Facebook and maybe it's already heading that way
C	it was Stephen Fry who popularized it
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	he said I use Twitter and everyone suddenly joined Twitter
A	yes
B	he's a genius
C	yeah so
B	he's gonna make it interesting
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	so er
A	yeah
B	actually if he'd just cleaned his teeth maybe it is a bit interesting
A	I don't really wanna know when celebrities clean their teeth either to be honest
B	yeah
A	well I obviously do you know so
A	but
C	but one
A	yeah there are
C	because um I I mean I've got quite a lot of people on my friends list now
A	mm
C	that's true but that might be cos they're from another country
A	yes
C	but I do
B	yeah
C	find people who have similar interests
A	yes
C	to me
A	yes
C	and I won't bore people about this
B	no
C	a really big fan of Roger Federer
C	and there's a lot of people I found a lot of people on there some of whom I'd class among the people I'd contact most
A	mm
C	on there
A	yeah
C	who are also fans
A	mm
C	you sort of
A	oh yeah yeah well er I think that's a very good thing
C	it's quite interesting to the game similar to it than um
A	A and the other very good thing about it of course um is is the fact that you can find people on there that you really wanna get in touch with
C	mm
A	either family members or friends
B	mm
A	that you've lost touch with
C	this is true this is true
A	and it's so much easier than say it was
B	no
C	no you'd struggle
A	it
C	you'd probably send them a card
A	it would be very difficult
C	it'd take several weeks to get there
A	yeah
C	if they
A	yeah
C	live
A	but but sometimes
C	in a remote place
A	you can get this information quite quickly
B	mm
A	and and you reunite families that way
A	have a very good effect like that
C	yeah
A	um
C	well I I
A	would you say? Or is it
C	I would think
A	fifty fifty?
C	I would definitely say so
A	mm
C	but it's like anything in life
A	mm
C	yeah it can it can be used in a bad way
A	I think it's quite hard to leave Facebook isn't it?
B	yeah
C	but somebody else pointed out yeah well that could happen er not just Facebook it could happen in the real world
B	mm
C	you gotta stop using something else cos somebody's used it in a really detrimental way
B	no
C	but er
A	but it made him think
C	it made him think
A	twice maybe yeah
B	yeah
C	but that's not unique to Facebook
A	no it isn't
C	or to whatever
A	no it isn't
B	yeah
C	to social networking
A	but people think more in those virtual terms these days don't they
C	they do
A	they might not think that that could have happened in another way in a way
B	yeah
A	a Facebook thing does it
C	in some ways it makes it more immediate
A	yeah it does
C	Facebook they know what friends saw it
B	mm
C	so it's so it's updated
B	yeah
A	it does it does
C	what does that say?
A	mm
B	and things you say to someone in person aren't as aren't as likely to be misconstrued
C	no
A	I guess not
C	no
A	I guess not
B	well you'll get e-mails at work and you think bloody hell that was blunt
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	and you think about who sent it and think no they didn't mean it like that at all
A	they don't mean it like that
B	it's just that
A	yeah
B	thoughtless way of expressing yourself
A	but in in in general though e-mails you know texts and things you put on Facebook
B	mm
A	and Twitter
C	mhm
B	mm
A	the I think they are more sort of open to interpretation
B	yeah
C	I thought that
C	I mean
A	and I don't think they think about it too much
B	yeah
A	when they do it
C	I think an example even myself I consider myself quite diplomatic in how I said it but when um Davey Jones of The Monkees died
A	oh yeah
B	mm
C	recently
C	and I were just debating it with one of my friends
A	mm
C	and she said oh I know the band
A	mm
C	I said well then you know who he is
B	yeah
C	and I was saying like
A	oh really?
C	um I said well I didn't mean any offence by it
B	mm
C	in the band
B	yeah
C	therefore er you know
B	yeah
C	and she said oh it's okay
A	she's taken it in a way that you you were thinking of her
B	yeah
A	as thick in some way or something
C	no I I wasn't a I first thought that
A	no no is that how she was taking it you think or
C	I said oh you're too young to know them
A	no oh I see right
C	Cos they're a sixties band
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	and she wasn't born until like seventies
A	mm
C	she didn't sort of take it if I if I'd been sat there and said it to her
B	mm
A	mm
B	yeah
C	it would've come across
A	differently
B	yeah
C	er I sent her a message said well like I didn't mean anything by that
B	yeah
C	just me
A	you do have to be
C	so you can you know it can be open to interpretation
A	I think you do have to be a lot more careful when you're texting and e-mailing
B	yeah
A	for the best
B	mhm
A	and sometimes when you get a response back it's
B	I tell you what I'd never feel offended by anything you'd send
B	although do you wanna renew cos I know you
C	yeah
C	yeah
B	what does it mean?
A	I was gonna ask you that actually
B	what does it mean like that?
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	no I'm I'm glad that you've not been offended by the few e-mails that I've sent you
A	that that's a relief
A	well like yeah I know
B	yeah
A	generally yeah
B	yeah
A	you'd probably fall asleep just thinking about them or looking at them but
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	they're methodical
A	oh er well I don't know if they are
A	it's nice of you to say so
B	texts
C	that's a very methodical
A	er er texts have got a little bit better since I put punctuation in them
B	punctuation's good
C	I think it's good
A	it's a start
B	yeah
C	I think so
A	yeah it's a start certainly
B	mm
C	yeah
A	but er yeah no um you do you do have to be careful on Facebook
C	no
A	I don't know
C	no I
A	I don't miss it
B	yeah
A	are we
B	are we talking too long?
unknown_female	no
A	too loud
C	um yeah
A	mm
C	imagine now sort of going off it
C	it wouldn't wouldn't make any I suppose it wouldn't really make any
B	mm
C	difference
A	mm
C	probably spend too much time on it
A	isn't it quite hard
B	mm
A	to delete your account on Facebook? From what I've heard
C	I think you can deactivate it
A	is that the same as
B	it's like
A	deleting it though?
C	it's not
B	yeah
A	is it?
B	you can't it's really hard to
A	you can't delete it properly can you?
B	probably not if you
C	no
A	that's what I've heard and read
B	I've got a Google blog
A	oh right
C	mhm
B	and it's pretty well impossible to
A	right
B	to get rid of it
C	mm
A	that's wrong in a way isn't it
C	yeah
A	if you wanted to
C	mm
B	they can sit there inactive forever
A	that's not really
B	yeah but you can't
A	right
B	just go actually you know I'm a bit embarrassed I'd like to have removed all that
C	removed it altogether
B	mm
C	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	I don't see why you shouldn't
B	yeah
A	be allowed to delete them
B	no I think you just have to
C	deactivate it
A	but what I know you can't do you can only go so far and you just
B	yeah
A	deactivate it
B	I think what you have to do is just sort of deactivate the person
C	mm
B	and move to a new country
B	Cos that person's staying on Facebook forever
A	right yeah
C	A bit drastic ain't it
A	well yeah
B	like if you really want to disassociate yourself from it
C	yeah
B	it's probably gonna be easier to have er
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	cosmetic surgery
A	well yeah
B	adopt a new persona
C	mm
A	and some people of course
C	yeah
A	they won't change the person but they'll change
B	mhm
A	the name on Facebook
C	yeah
A	and you know they'll
B	hm
A	then sort of maybe delete somebody and then they might add them back on as a friend or something as being good experience to have
B	yeah
C	yeah have a good experience together
A	but but yeah but you can pretty much do anything
B	yeah
A	on on Facebook
B	yeah
A	Oldham Athletic have a Facebook page
B	yeah
A	it's quite difficult to believe but they've
C	yeah
A	yeah they will
B	yeah
A	probably got more members than ours
C	yeah
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	but yeah
B	yeah
unknown_female	okay
C	yeah
A	ah
C	it er yeah it's funny the thing where they people deleting you as a friend
C	and they'll take you you off as a friend
A	it's not that they won't even add you back on then the next day
C	yeah sometimes it's a mistake
C	and um
A	yeah
C	it's like one of my friends er she took me off and er
A	pressed the wrong button of the mouse
C	but I'd definitely not done any and
C	and I thought I'm sure I've not done anything to offend her
A	but some people can get very upset by that even though it's
B	mm
C	she did
A	it's an accident
C	she did apologize quite profusely
A	problems or tension
C	yeah
B	mhm
A	or conflict or
C	but er but
A	yeah it's so I suppose there's more chance of misinterpretation
B	mhm
A	beforehand
C	I think
B	yeah
C	I think it's so immediate as well
B	mm
A	yeah
C	and instead of thinking well er okay maybe I won't
B	yeah
C	a reply straight away and like
A	yeah
C	get a big
A	never post details on there
C	oh no
C	oh gosh no
A	well no
B	oh yeah
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	oh you've given me ideas now
C	no I wouldn't
B	so
C	so we can't I can't convince you to reactivate your account?
A	I don't know Stephen
C	or sort your password out
B	oh
A	I don't know may maybe I should maybe I should maybe I should
B	yeah get a bit a quiet time this afternoon
B	when you go home
C	quite enjoy it
B	yeah
A	I I did go on it through somebody else though
B	aw
A	last last November
B	aw
A	been on it
C	well that's
A	on after
B	yeah
A	I'd been on it
C	mm
A	and that was strange to me
C	yeah
A	Cos it I didn't comprehend that
C	it's true
B	yeah
