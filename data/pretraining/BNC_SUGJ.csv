A	right so I'm gonna start it out now so so we can talk about the kinds of things you wanted to get my
B	right okay right well first and foremost like I said was talking about this erm er who who do you reckon would be the first person to contact?
A	about the conversion of this space?
B	yeah about the structural sort of possibilities cos if they then if they've gotta stay connected to these stud walls for some unknown weird reason then that sort of stops it going ahead
A	yeah
B	cos we can't go putting in any more supports it will be intrusive enough to have a space that's got these steels and just about saleable with those steels all the way through the room
A	yeah erm I erm I think it's very
B	yeah
A	so erm and he was the architect for all of that work and that was the point at which they put the theatre in downstairs and these spaces upstairs were converted into those erm kind of little shed things
B	yeah
A	the little chicken wire sheds that we saw in that photograph out there so whether these struts are part of keeping the ceiling
A	so whether they took something else out some other kind of structural support or some other kind of structural if
B	I would've thought there would've been roof joists standard roof joists
A	yeah
B	cos that's what steels was there to replace
A	but then we've got a flat roof here so I don't know what's above this roof there is a there is actually a
B	yeah there is an attic
A	there is an attic have you been up there? have you had a look up there?
B	yeah it's got no but no but there wouldn't be any joists all the way along it then
A	but you could have you could stick your head through that hole and see what's holding the roof up because this could be part of some structure from
B	yeah yeah mm
A	the roof up above or erm
B	well if it's anything above there that's not gonna be an issue but if it's like I say if it's if if for some er weird reason they've put these erm braces roof braces roof ties whatever they're gonna be actually called on non-load-bearing walls which is what all these are
A	yeah
B	then that'd be weird and
A	but do they go through? I mean is that is that
B	yeah they go all the way through yeah these struts yeah
A	that goes all the way through so that bit there will go has got a bit that then travels across that office and the next office
B	yeah yeah yeah they erm they criss-cross but I think the upright extensions that they'll stand on are behind the outside walls
A	yeah
B	so yeah the uprights and the bits that we really really can't remove
A	yeah
B	are in the space that we don't wanna touch anyway
A	yeah that's fine
B	so that'd be ideal I think
A	all I'm worried about is these metals struts the
B	the metal struts we can't move but I don't think they'll stop us selling the room I mean if they come to sort of here at the at the most if you opened up that room and had that space double if you were doing a dance class in here there's still space in between them
A	yeah
B	to actually use erm I mean it's still a usable space you could set the room up
A	no
B	it's erm it's a minor hindrance really I mean it'd be a pain for sort of Krav Maga and stuff like that
A	well yeah that would be dangerous wouldn't it?
B	yeah
A	if they'd trip over them
B	yeah well that's it and you'd you'd hit into them but if it's
A	yeah
B	sedate activities like dancing and stuff like that where it's more erm it's more controlled
A	well I don't know what kind of stuff
B	mm
A	erm I think it's all kinds I mean I've I can't er I looked at her website a long time ago but er at that time she was offering so little in the way of rent
B	mm
A	that it just wasn't feasible for her to take her proposal any further than
B	well if if unless if it was er drastically increased from the old stream of emails that I read through the twenty K mark we'll only get her basically the erm times on the days and and slots that she wants so she could have a similar thing to Krav Maga four evenings a week and a Saturday
A	yeah
B	for that for that price
A	yeah
B	and she's still going to be quite a little bit under what we would've been able to achieve with other people
A	well er I think she's come when I mean I think I told her that twenty thousand wasn't gonna do it
B	mm
A	so hopefully she's
B	that was for exclusive use though on a lease wasn't it?
A	er yes she was looking to lease a space
B	yeah
A	erm and she said to me it wasn't that wasn't affordable at the time but we had that conversation about money so if it turns out that erm she comes back er she has come back to me which means that theoretically she's got more money than she did before
B	mm cos if I just work out say fifteen hours a week three five erm five three-hour slots erm
A	yeah
B	which is basically we're only in
A	but er but then how much is Krav Maga paying again?
B	thirty-six that's what I mean I wouldn't be able to
A	mm
B	and that's only because they've got the the vast majority of er the business coming from them so I mean if we did it that way then seven hundred and fifty hours over the course of a year at thirty-six quid that's still twenty-seven grand
A	yeah so we're looking for thirty for a shared use basically
B	yeah yeah
A	yeah
B	of of around fifteen hours a week maybe a little bit more give or take but I need to be able to rent it out for the lion's share of the days Monday through Friday nine till five
A	yeah then if we're if we set ourselves a target for how much we want to earn off the space a year
B	mm
A	then we can work
B	mm
A	so if the target is to turn sixty grand a year off the space then if she pays
B	mm I I wouldn't wanna give her that
A	yeah but but that's the only
B	oh yeah if it were something to start from it'd be alright
A	yeah
B	but what you've gotta bear in mind is that the slot where I make up the rest of the money the fifty-five pound an hour into the sixty-five pound an hour tariff is the one that she's taking up a lion's share of the hours from
A	yeah
B	so it diminishes all possibility of being able to get an a bump up of of money I mean I wouldn't be able to get many more churches and stuff in which is also good money at the weekend
A	yeah but then on the other hand we must bear in mind that all of these people are erm temporary fixtures if we give them a space we don't have to give them a space forever so say for example if
B	mm
A	so that we give them six months or we give them a year and it's renewable after that time so we er you know we don't want to mess people about and and throw them out and have them on the streets but quite frankly they they they will up sticks as we know they will up sticks and disappear from one week to the next
B	yeah
A	if it suits them so therefore we should have contracts with them that allow us to say look I'm sorry we've changed our minds this is not working for us
B	mm
A	and and erm er and you know please review terminate and go away by extent which is the end of your term contract with us so rather than being arbitrary with people we we we do sort of say to them look this is for six months this is for a year and then at the end of the year we reserve the right to renegotiate
B	well the main set-up with erm the erm hall bookings more specifically Krav Maga at the minute they're on a recurring contract where we can stop them just as as easy as they can stop us
A	mm
B	but the understanding I've got with them is that his price is based on a is he's been given a price for the next year so next April May sort of time we'll have to go through and renegotiate his his tariff that he's on cos it will have to go up a little bit
A	mm
B	but then we could look at doing that and go right okay I'm gonna put your money up but I will give the security of a twelve-month fix so
A	yeah I mean the thing is that if you I mean it's like renting a flat it's like anything or renting a room or whatever erm you you have a starting price and then other people can put it up
B	yeah
A	at will really the only way to not have that kind of thing happen to you is have a formal lease
B	yeah
A	you know whereby you commit to quite a big long period of time yourself so that you know you're both tied in to
B	mm
A	the deal the rent is set on one side the term is set on the other side and then that both gives you advantages and then perhaps you that that's when you know you've got your
B	mm
A	and you want to be able to disappear between one day and the next you have to accept that your landlord might want to put your rent up between one day and the next
B	yeah well what I was thinking about for this space
A	mm
B	going back to that is basically giving it over to people like
A	yeah
B	and people needing it and saying to them
A	yeah
B	look okay for nine months of the year I can guarantee you can get a Monday Tuesday and a Wednesday
A	yeah
B	and I will hold it free
A	yeah
B	but then for three months of the year I will give nobody erm preference over say
A	yeah er well yeah but except for the fact that actually what we worked out in the past was you can't ride those two horses at once if
A	yeah but but it's it's a season
B	er you can't have
A	no no but you have to work it for a season you wouldn't actually do it
A	yeah I
B	mm
A	and when you look back at our schedules they used to be here you know they used to be here for ten weeks twenty weeks or something like that out of fifty-two
B	mm
A	and then gradually gradually it cut cut cut down and we were holding it free for them in case they came back and then they they just went off and they used somebody else's hall instead and actually the weird thing about that particular company is the scabbier the space
B	yeah the more they like it
A	the more they rent it I mean the the more we did up the space the less they took it on it was very bizarre I mean it was it you know who?
B	mm
A	I can't well I don't know they just I don't know whether they're really grungy old hippy types and they really liked it being sort of scabby and dirty and everything made them feel like they were at home in downtown
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	erm well
A	yeah
B	and try and transplant stuff up and down you know
A	yeah although on the other hand we're not actually doing any or much active marketing at the moment so
B	er there's no point at the minute
B	yeah
A	or who wants a Friday or something like that and it has to be those days because that's all we've got I mean like you know the town hall people it strikes me are going to be one of our best options on that because we
B	mm
A	they want you know they want us to commit to particular dates particular times but it it is always going to be difficult because er and there's always going to be slots that can't that can't be filled and and and if and we decided to do this thing that we were discussing the other night of being a themed some sort of themed building where we go for say religious uses or educational uses that's gonna actually make it worse
B	that'll make it really difficult won't it?
A	because somebody somebody will come along and say can I have it on a Monday? and say well are you educational?
B	no
A	no so okay do we accept the money? or do we stick out for an educational project that is gonna have it full time?
B	I think we try we try the theme thing but with always the
A	yeah
B	that comes through the door sort of thing we don't turn money away but if we've got a choice of two people we may we may take slightly less profit or maybe even at break even for some some hours to choose to go in the field that we want to be in but we need to actually pay the bills first we're not in a position of luxury that we can just turn away money
A	no no absolutely no I know that better than anybody actually but I mean what we're coming back
B	mm mm
A	and took up the whole of this suite of offices for example that's that's a possibility that we actually you know we have had those strokes of luck before
B	mm
A	and you know we've we've marketed small spaces to small organisations but if there is a distinct possibility that somebody might take the whole
B	mm
A	and they might want it as a as a single thing or as a big room and and that is always erm
B	mm if we're gonna do that I think we do that with the central area of the hub we actually put some proper decent online marketing on with the property people to say that there is a
A	mm
B	can be configured into
B	this that or the other
A	the only trouble with most estate agents is they take fifteen percent of the first year's rent as their fee
B	mm well erm
A	and I've
B	yeah it is a lot of money I think what we should be doing then and this is what I've sort of tried to say right from the beginning is to get that space configured by a new person coming in we just aim for break even for the first year cos it's been a year now if not more where we've not made a single penny from it if you look at it per seat there is that central area it's not made any money
A	well
B	if we had a year of break even
A	yeah but ah ah except for the fact that actually one thing I need to do erm is to talk to
B	yeah just
A	and it's been in use by
B	well the central area yeah for
A	neither of them have contributed a single red cent to that space
B	mm
A	and you know what I was thinking about
B	well no in the evening they have paid it's just been a ridiculously small figure that is just not worth us doing for the amount of hassle so I sent them that email the other day anyway saying it's
A	ah I forgot to ask about that
B	but it came last week but I'm still waiting for the erm email via Germany suppliers erm
A	about the legs?
B	yeah
B	no he's waiting for the suppliers to get back to him
A	cos I bet you any money at all if you emailed the suppliers direct you'd get a you'd get a better response and a quicker response than via
A	do you know who made it?
B	no
B	I think it's
A	oh right there's probably a factory manager
B	yeah
A	who will respond to you before you've even finished your email
B	well I'll prompt him again tomorrow cos that'll have been a week again then erm and just see what he says cos as far as I'm concerned we need to know about the legs
A	yeah
B	we've we've gotta have the legs otherwise there's no point in
A	oh yeah no no absolutely absolutely
B	yeah
B	right okay so just coming back to this then
A	yeah
B	er if I speak to
A	yes
B	er and just send him an email just saying can you give me a straight answer erm about
A	well I am erm er er what you could say in that email is that
B	mm
A	to sort of er progress discussions that you that we started last month but in the meantime I've got a query about the configuration of the sixth floor you know IE these beams the metal and the and the plaster beams that go across
B	er yeah
A	because erm you know I need to know whether they're structural and if so what are they holding up? because erm we're thinking about renovating the space and we need to know you know which bits we can get rid of and which bits we can't
B	yeah
A	and we feel that this is probably work that you did as part of your your renovations so
B	well I would've thought it would be a simple answer for er an architect whether it was him or not because he'll know what they are
A	oh you know what he well he's very obsessive about this building anyway
A	and he was sort of so over the moon it was quite funny have you got an eye infection there?
B	no
A	making your eye go red
B	it's just itchy
A	is it?
B	mm just dry I think
B	mm
A	god is that stingy blimey
B	yeah iroko's thingy wood erm oh I can't remember what it's called now it's got loads of sap stuff in it if it's not dried out properly
A	it was dry it was quite dry but it was erm it was very hard so when I was grinding my hands are
B	mm
A	when I was taking the stuff off it was coming off in really little shaves
B	yeah
A	and it was quite pungent and it was er going in my eyes and up my nose
B	yeah there's some quite erm thingy there's some quite crazy wood that you get for doing stuff like that with
A	mm
B	it's not the kind of stuff that you'd use in normal carpentry though erm right so after I've spoke to
A	yeah
B	and looking at the differ things because if we can agree on two different things er two different products to go on the floor that will then give us an idea of what the spend it gonna be once I've spoke to sort of I dunno a a
A	yeah
B	or a general builder or something because getting the rubbish down the waste from these down will be a job
A	yeah
B	I don't wanna do it through the building if we can possibly avoid it
A	it would be nice if we could have a shute
B	you can have a shute but that'll need scaffolding
A	really?
B	yeah
A	okay well scaffolding's not that dear
B	no but it's just
B	it would it would only be a single storey it wouldn't be like a man scaffold unit
A	no
B	it would be just be scaffolding and rigging
A	yeah
B	to attach a thingy erm a shute a rubber shute to the to the erm
A	parapet
B	parapet on that
A	yeah
B	and everything could go out there
A	yeah
B	it'd just be putting everything up which is easy enough
A	yeah
B	erm and that'd be the main cost I think erm in addition to the flooring
A	yeah
B	cos that'd be I dunno a couple of days rather than about a week and a half
A	yeah
B	to get rid of the crap then erm and I think that would be the only big cost the rest of it would just be stuff that I could do with a couple of
A	I thought you'd turned over a new leaf
A	I thought you had gone beyond all this stuff now that you weren't
B	no I don't want to do it every day like I was doing it once a week around the building but something big like this would be alright to do cos it would be an achievement rather than the rest of it's just like the Forth Bridge
A	I know
B	just constantly doing stuff and then having to redo it so
B	no it'll be alright
A	that's my space
B	it'd be it'd be good to convert it into something that's used cos at the minute er it's just not being used
A	no
B	it's kind of dead area really and
A	and what and how do you feel where's
B	I don't know I would have to speak to her basically and see what she says whether she'd consider it
A	is there any moaning and groaning about the facilities lately?
B	er no not as much not as much but then there's not been
A	are they using the toilets down in the hub?
B	erm I'm not too sure I have no idea I haven't seen them in there
A	oh right no cos I was just wondering the sort of the complaint about students going in there might be cos that little spindly one was going in there
B	no no no no no it's definitely not them I watched a full day of CCTV footage
B	er to check and no there isn't erm
A	much less interesting than it used to be I dare say
B	yeah definitely erm
B	cos that would be the only option as it stands at the minute considering I've just given
A	oh yeah
B	so I don't wanna dislodge anybody that's not permanent ongoing
A	no
B	I mean the way
B	yeah so as far as I'm aware there's nobody down that end of the
A	what about the
A	what space?
B	the
A	no
B	no they wouldn't they may use it
A	well not as a storage area they could have that
B	yeah but apparently it's not a storage apparently it's a kitchen and sort of staff room which is never used so it's just a case of it would be it would literally be an option of you've got two in this side I can offer you one down there or you can go sort of thing
A	they do like two offices they've always had two offices
B	yeah I I I fully understand that and if if they want them that's fine they're paying for em but to to move them rehome them wouldn't be an option unless we built an extra one in this end here and gave them that one and
A	no
B	I don't think
A	no
B	they wouldn't have that at all
A	no no no no they'd want it right close to each other but are they
B	never in there never at all that I'm aware of obviously I'm not down there that much but
A	they have their microwave in there and their lunch and make coffee though don't they?
B	yeah well yeah that's something that they could put in their space though
A	perhaps erm perhaps
A	where someone's been eating their kebab over the
B	yeah
A	packet
B	well erm it's it's obviously it's something that they do need but
A	please can you send me a new CD? cos I dropped my lunch on the last one
A	no
B	without creating something but that would literally be the only other thing really erm the meeting room I think we could sort of erm we could get by again with using one of the other spaces down the other end like you say about moving the the partition wall further into the kitchen
A	yeah
B	and that'd create a space that's
A	yeah
B	sort of available I mean obviously the meetings would have to be pushed on a little bit
A	no well I mean the thing is about having this room it's about having access A us having access to the roof whenever we need it and not having to knock on doors because er we've seen as with the people in the crypt you say we need permanent access to the electricity room and the gas room
B	yeah
A	er and the the plant and everything and then you have to argue with them to get a bloody key and then and then er before you turn round they've changed the locks so you have to get another key
B	mm
A	and then there's an instance they ask for the key back et cetera when this er there was a set of people who were in this office for a really long period of time getting in this office to get on the roof was the a right royal pain cos you could never get in
B	well if this was on
A	and then secondly then as soon as we got as soon as they left and got in we discovered that they had been they had got deck chairs out there they were lying sunbathing on the roof all the tiles were broken where they'd been clambering all over the roof
B	mm
A	and getting up there and god knows what they'd been up to out there it was just er you know you have to honestly save people they've got to have the keys to the door so you can't stop them going out there and the next minute they're scrambling all over the roof like they're
B	mm well the point of having this as an open space would make it very easy to get access to the bell tower door and that roof door
A	mm
B	because you just say to people that I dunno say we had
A	yeah
B	I mean I'm the only person that goes out there without planning it cos I don't have to tell people what I'm doing
A	yeah
A	by the way have you done a
B	I've checked er it's on a reminder on the phone yeah er
A	oh good and how many dead pigeons are out there?
B	erm there's less than normal I think
A	actually the other thing to put on the list on our maintenance list for next year is to have that netting
B	yeah
A	those watching those pigeons dying of hunger gradually and then dropping off bit by bit is disgusting and they're getting in somewhere the stupid twits well how they can I don't know why they can get in and not out did you say they can only fly upwards or something? or downwards or something? was there somebody saying about pigeons they they can't fly in every direction?
B	I don't know I don't think they can fly backwards
A	but then they can get in they sort of walk along the ledge
B	I think I think they just sort of yeah I think they're crawling in there from one of the other sides and then they're not using their brain to know that they've walked in they can walk out and they're panicking they're trying to flap out and not coming out er
A	yeah they've only got a brain the size of a pea
B	yeah but they're also
B	and being in and out of it and then obviously they get big one day and they can't fit through the hole any more so but I dunno I
A	mm and did you say that somebody's got a hawk
B	no there is a hawk there is definitely a pigeon hawk or a kestrel hawk or whatever you get
A	we could have a bird of prey up here that would be really fun wouldn't it?
B	I don't think you can just get a bird of prey I think you need them to naturally to be in the area
A	no no no there's no no no there was a feature on the on the radio yesterday about erm there's this guy who runs they they they
B	yeah
A	Trafalgar square with a bird once every couple of weeks and
B	yeah
A	and when we've got the peace garden we can have we can have a we could have falconry
B	well I was thinking about erm the erm city beekeeping initiative thing
A	oh that would be fun wouldn't it?
B	they do these plastic beehive things that you put out and erm we'd put it on the other side cos the other side is much less
A	yeah
B	erm and it'd really good
A	I the other thing that I'd really like to do as well is have erm
B	mm
A	er apparently you can get a tape which you play which has got swift noises on it so it makes other swifts think oh that oh hang on
B	mm
A	that's a nice neighbourhood
B	mm
A	and then they come and er roost because erm they're running out of places to roost and the their
B	I think the roof is yeah I think the roof's best to er have no birds on it at all cos of the amount of crap out there at the minute is no good I mean er
A	yeah no look at those weeds as well
B	yeah
A	you need to get out there with your weed spray
B	yeah erm
A	oh yeah?
B	cos
B	a couple of weeks later
A	that you had had a go at it?
B	er yeah yeah but I think it's just a case of that it's just an ongoing thing that the street care team or whoever it is the grass cutting guys just don't bother doing it
A	no
B	and they don't do the privets and
A	no
B	you know it's just a bit of a pain
B	yeah they're getting ridiculous I went to park my car against em the other day and without driving into the privet my car was sticking right out
A	mm
B	so unless you've got a small car those gaps
A	oh
B	those er thingies those parking spaces are not big enough any more
A	no but also then
B	yeah well erm I'll try and get that get er get on to
A	well we can I mean if we knew erm if we know when they're coming we can have everybody move you know just park that bit further out or park in front of the building
B	well I'll just I'll just do the same arrangement as a wedding or a thingy just get the four or five cars
A	mm
B	that need to be in for the day
A	mm
B	in and then the guys can get in and cut
A	mm
B	and then go away again although they're not
A	er yeah yeah
B	and it's the same team
A	is it?
B	yeah it will be
A	they must be subcontractors of subcontractors I mean they're just
B	they are but I think these guys were all taken on from
A	oh really?
B	yeah I think that's what they did
A	oh they've been TUPE'd across?
B	yeah they've all been TUPE'd across
B	cos the guy even the young guy was adamant he'd been working there for years and years and years and they actually all wear
A	it's not really er it's it's er it's the other frog one erm sorry the other French one
B	yeah
A	erm
B	I can't remember who it is now
A	yeah
B	so anyway just going back to this so we can write that down so
A	yeah
B	I'll speak to
A	er well yeah do you want to go?
B	there's a place
B	erm we can go this afternoon if you like I've got nothing else to do once I've finished off the schedules erm we can do that so we'll go and view flooring there's a place in
A	yeah no
A	I haven't been to
B	yeah okay we'll do that
A	and now you're mobile again
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	and I know they're hardwearing they're basically really good for soundproof and sound insulation er
A	oh no I think that's a good idea I mean I don't I mean this stuff is disgusting I think
B	it's crap laminate but it's good for a base you can lay on the top of it
A	yeah
B	which is then called a floating floor what you're meant to do is have this stuff called erm soundboard which is green sort of medium density sort of like MDF but papery looking
A	yeah
B	these boards that go down and you do like a tiled floor of that and then you put laminate on top
B	with erm a foil backing on it that's a proper laminate floor installation
A	mm
B	but obviously this hasn't got it cos you can feel it hasn't got
A	no no no this is as cheap as chips
B	yeah
A	this is this is from you know sort of er well in fact we had
B	mm
A	a flooring merchant oh no we had the
B	that looks really good compared to this and it lasts longer than the laminate as well if you get any chairs and stuff banging against this too much
A	yeah
B	it'll go quickly
A	no and it's horrible round the edges this sort of er trim that you put round the edges looks really crap
B	yeah
A	but erm er yeah I think and also it's I think it's quite nice having a quite a nice bright colour
B	well a bright
B	yeah
A	and also then if we get
B	mm
A	then you know it'll come up with a nice buff and it'll look good
B	and you can see it's been cleaned and er and this stuff just looks
A	yeah yeah it does it can you know
B	mm
A	yes and you look down and you think oh we had somebody working here
B	mm
A	who and I think she had false hair and when you sat in her seat and looked at the floor you could see
B	yeah that was in the offices yeah
A	er horrible horrible
B	erm so going on to spending then as you've probably just overheard with
A	yeah
B	er are you happy for me to carry on having
A	no no that's absolutely fine if you're happy with the quality of their work
B	it's fine for it's fine for this I wouldn't have him decorate my house but he's he's fine for these kind of spaces you know
A	they do look a bit er are they they don't look as if they're the sharpest tools in the box those two when you look at them
B	I don't know they're just
A	mm
B	if his dad's a chippy he's probably done his apprenticeship when he was on his six-week holidays or getting er suspended from secondary school or whatever
B	and instead of going to college or whatever he's done that erm
A	well if you're
B	no well erm petty cash has only been used for materials which it's gotta be and it's just the same as me going up the road and buying it and just coming back with the receipt and done it all properly erm other than that no his his actual wages his hours for a day's work are getting paid by a cheque I've told him that I can get him a cheque really quickly now at the minute
A	yeah
B	with
A	yeah
B	and also like today if he wants the cheque for a hurry cos he's going on holiday and I'm then going on holiday we can just write him the limit you know
A	yeah
B	er so it's all being done above above board and by the book sort of thing
A	okay that's fine
B	so I'm gonna carry on with the
A	no no I just don't want to be
B	mm
A	erm
B	well to be honest there's not really any need for another general builder at the minute erm speaking to him yesterday he does know somebody that can do installation of vinyl flooring like you know the guy that came from
A	oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
B	he's got a guy down the road working on some flats for
A	okay
B	erm and I mean they're doing that now and I've said to him maybe I'll get him in to redo the bathroom erm gents floor and the ladies at some point because the paint's just not standing up to the wee basically
A	oh really?
B	yeah it's come off already
B	yeah if you have a look in the gents in the cubicles and in front of the urinal where you're gonna get piss splashes on the floor it's coming up it is eating away at it
A	you're joking
B	no it's eating away but he said that's because it's water-based paint which is meant to be oil-proof for like in a car er from
A	yeah?
B	so it's been designed to be oil-proof but you've obviously got erm er well I can't remember what the chemical is in urine
A	urea
B	no there's something else it's
A	ammonia?
B	yeah ammonia ammonia will break it down because it's erm water-based whereas if it's an oil-based paint ammonia won't break it down
A	but should should shouldn't he know that?
B	well he
A	but he should well
B	cos er no cos he came to me and said oh I'm really sorry but the floor's lifting I was like no it's alright I've seen it it's not lifting where you've actually done the work where people aren't peeing on it but where they are peeing on it it's coming away so they're peeing on it it's sitting there for a day the cleaner's going in the next day and it's it's taken the colour out of it
A	by that time it's
B	yeah it's by that time it's sat on it
A	so is it visibly horrible?
B	in patches it's only small patches like that at the minute but yeah it's it's not gonna look good for very long so what I'm saying is what I will get the guy to do is I will get the guy to do a little run a little square with offcuts cos we've said that we might be able to get it on the cheap from his job that he's doing at the minute
A	oh
B	from his waste and just do the
A	right
B	cos that's where it's gonna be worst and then the bit in front of the urinal we can do at a later stage but it's a bit of an issue er
A	so what would he do? would he kind of he would get cubicle shape
B	well he he'll have offcuts
A	cubicle-sized offcuts and then what? weld them together with the with the sticky
B	yeah he
A	to the walls
B	yeah to the walls of the cubicle
A	oh yeah cos the walls of the cubicles go down to the floor don't they?
B	yeah yeah they touch
A	right okay so that's fine so all you need is an oblong of
B	yeah yeah just about I dunno er I dunno a metre by a metre for each one so he needs four four
A	yeah okay
B	and which I'm pretty certain they can just write off in a day
A	yeah
B	so I'll get him to do that if I can and that will just be a cash job and I'll just make it out that I paid for the materials and they did that themself
A	okay
B	erm cos that would be the same
A	yeah
B	erm so I'll get that done if I can
A	well no I think I think that needs to be done as soon as possible cos I think it's
B	well it's the floor that's made the space look so good
A	yeah
B	so I don't want the floor being er being rough
A	yeah no you're gonna get you're gonna get a repeat of exactly the same problem again
B	yeah but some idiot has gone in there already and it's a good job that he's not actually made it into that cubicle yet with the the top coat of paint and scratched his name in it scratched his name in the back of the door and in the cubicle so that pissed me off already the other day but erm
A	so is that a child from
B	it's not a child from
A	but is that
B	I
A	do you think it's one of them?
B	definitely it's either one of them or someone from Krav Maga
A	oh
B	but I don't think it's somebody from Krav Maga I
A	why not?
B	because they're too busy they're all quite straight bods and they are busy when they're in the building they're not the kind who wants to go and sit in the toilets you know?
A	so is it sitting height? or standing height?
B	it's the sitting height
A	really?
B	yeah so somebody is sat in the toilet bored cos you wouldn't go into the toilet and be busy doing what you're doing and do that you know? it's somebody who's sitting in the toilets bored on their phone and just
A	multitasking
B	yeah some idiot but no it's not it's it's the style of writing isn't a child's style of writing it's definitely not
A	how stupid honestly I mean has
B	well I don't know er
A	so have you said something to
B	I don't know whether anybody's seen it it's it's scraped into it with a key or something sharp
A	yeah
B	something sharp and thick
A	it's have you said anything to
B	no cos the toilets aren't finished yet if the first thing that happens when the toilets are finished I will go and check cos I did check the name against cos it's it's literally
A	and is there and er is there a
B	there's nothing that correlates from the erm student list at the minute but then it could be a nickname I don't know
A	yeah well you er perhaps you could get erm
B	there'd there'd be a way of checking but
A	yeah
B	like I say once it's finished once it is finished I will be sort of erm more on it than that and I am going to do something I'm going to do like a toilet attendance sheet or something for the guys so when they're meant to be doing their internal chores they can go and check the toilets cos it's starting to annoy me now erm so yeah that'll be something that we'll be doing but anyway I'm gonna carry on getting
A	yeah
B	erm the store's pretty much built in the fourth floor he's gotta come back on Monday to finish it cos
A	oh
A	and it's
B	it'll be fine it's made out of sterling board
B	it's made out of sterling board and it's it's er to to that
A	right
B	in the corner so once it's painted it'll look like it's always been there
A	right yeah
B	and it'll be fine depending what lock I put on the door will make it look slightly different
A	okay yeah you don't want anything too industrial looking on it then
B	so I'm gonna have a look at the ironmongery on it well I might just put a single erm shackle and erm thingy like on it shackle and padlock like I've got in the kitchen there on it something like that cos it can't have a erm because it's double doors without a post
A	yes
B	it can't have a normal lock
A	no because otherwise people can just push it
B	yeah
B	mm
A	and like you know
B	well that's what I mean if I get a
A	oh no that's that little fly is it?
B	yeah erm
A	we've only got one little fly haven't we?
B	yeah I think so yeah
B	erm something that's definitely for inside rather than outside as well I won't put anything horrible on it but it needs to be something secure enough to make it erm make it that it's got to be broke for someone that wants to get in there that shouldn't be getting in there
A	yeah
B	so I'll do something like that erm he's gonna then blank off the two sets of doors that we're no longer using
A	yeah excellent
B	so he's got he's got some board to go over those
B	he's just literally gonna blank them
B	erm to the actual doorframe flush fitting so if we ever needed to use them in the future you just
A	yeah
B	literally pry the piece of timber out
A	yeah
B	so that's easy enough
B	so I'm gonna maybe get him to do some stuff like that around the place as well erm
A	oh er yeah no I've got another couple of suggestions
B	mm
A	which is that erm the entrance er somebody commented the other day that the doors into the community hall look really
B	yeah
A	and so we
B	well that's it that's the the the thing I'm gonna get
A	yeah yeah
B	so all the
A	and that
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	all the doors that are unglossed I'm gonna get him to gloss over
A	yeah
B	and fix up anything like the pane of glass that's in it I might get that removed
A	yeah
B	or just taken out or whatever whatever's easy erm then if there's anything that is not matching like we've got the brown stuff that like level two to three it went brown for a time
A	yeah
B	I want all that doing and the blue
A	yeah
B	I'll get him to come and do those
A	and also the door into the ladies loo has got has peeled
B	yeah yeah
A	cos it's a laminate door
B	well that just needs a coat of paint
A	yeah although there's a bit that I sort of could pull at this morning
B	right okay
A	where er there's er just a little there's just a little strip of
B	well if you just cut it just take more off it and cut it so it's square that'll be fine then
A	mm mm but yeah it does I mean the ladies looks immensely better already
B	well just yeah the coat of paint that went in on there the other day has made it lifted
A	yeah yeah it's er yeah absolutely hugely better
B	yeah totally lifted it mm
A	and then also wherever there's a coat of paint and it's looking
B	the the sort of yeah the the the old chill out space?
A	yeah
B	well I need a light in there
A	yeah
B	but at the minute we've got issues with the with the electrics the electrics are still throwing up problems erm
A	oh
B	with regards to the erm circuit boards that are in there the circuit board that's in there
A	yes
B	basically the circuit board that's in there the breakers that they've got are not sold by any electrical wholesaler the only place that still sells them is B and Q so it's basically it's
A	well it's yeah it's no it's
B	so
A	er it's
B	mm
A	doing a bit of their
B	mm
A	off the fire system in the cleaner's cupboard and stuff like that they were always sort of
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	and stuff like that that's all them that's their handiwork they were just honestly erm er it's a miracle that this building is still standing up quite frankly and we haven't had a fire so yes they would've done they would've messed around with the boards in there
B	mm well erm as far as I'm aware
A	and where are the boards for that bit?
A	oh are they?
B	one to the right one to the left
A	right
B	the one to the left we've had the community space light switches for the new uplighters and the ceiling lights removed so if you look at the blank door that we used to use into that space
A	mm
B	on the wall there there are now three socket three switches one's a blank switch which is gonna be an emergency light I think
A	mm
B	at some point in the future
A	mm
B	one is the hall lights and one is the ceiling lights so nothing on that board which has now got the Krav Maga storage unit built around it needs to be accessed on a daily basis
A	yeah
B	erm the the
A	oh yeah yeah
B	I don't know what else it controls but basically that's the board that needs to be made safe
A	yeah
B	there needs to be more breakers going in it
A	yeah
B	erm the gents toilet controls are literally on one switch in the board that's now got the Krav Maga store built around it so that's there nothing in there needs to be accessed on a daily basis
A	no
B	erm yeah we've er we're getting to the bottom of it what I will have by the end of this
A	yeah
B	so I'll be able to refer to a piece of paper and say right that's controlled from there
A	yeah okay well we had that before but yes it obviously needs updating cos we've done
B	yeah well things have been moved and split now boards have been erm yeah boards have been broken down
A	yeah
B	mm
A	we don't need those two wide fire escapes down to the front doors of the portico so only one of the fire escapes needs to be a fire escape the other one doesn't need to be a fire escape anymore and quite frankly when we have the peace garden
B	mm
A	we might need to use one of those spaces as a kind of storage space or something for gardening equipment the one the one that only goes up to the back of the fourth not erm you know the one there's the one that serves sixth
B	yeah
A	which is outside
B	that's the right-hand side one
A	that's the right-hand side one and that goes from top to bottom
B	yeah if you're in the community space
A	so that serves
B	yeah
B	mm
A	and the fourth floor
B	yeah
A	and
B	yeah
A	we could reuse that and make that into er you know I know it's got stairs and er it's not
B	well no it's it's it's got three full landings on it
A	yeah and there's space at the bottom
B	but the church have gotta use it the church have gotta use that on er at first floor above ground
B	cos it is theirs cos it's it's their second fire escape there's two fire escapes there's a mirror of fire escapes on the
A	yes yes
B	yeah they've got two down below that
A	yeah
B	but if they've got them they need to be able to use them
A	no no but then we take it out of service cos they can it's no longer a fire escape and get them to take the light off the exit
B	oh right okay yeah yeah
A	we say okay when you're on the mezzanine and your level you can either go to the right
B	there's a fire exit to the right
A	to get out the front of the building or you can go to the back and onto the central staircase so you've still got three fire exits at
B	yeah
A	but erm or
B	mm mm
A	so that you know? but erm but then that could also be another storage area at some point you know if we want er or actually if we wanted to reverse the building and have the gardening stuff at the back of the building
B	mm
A	up the back fire escapes we could then make the front fire escape a storage space
B	mm but you can't go right the way
A	yeah no no no I know no no no I what I'm talking about is you know the space where
B	oh yeah yeah
A	under the back stairs
B	yeah
A	so those storage spaces where we've got two churches
B	mm
B	yeah
A	those storage
B	yeah well that'd mean that they didn't need any access from us then basically
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah cos they'd just come out and go through the inner doors of the church reception or church foyer but
A	yeah yeah
B	yeah okay
A	so actually yes the landing outside the back of
B	could be their storage
A	that that could be their storage area
B	they wouldn't pay us for that though
B	we're we're only making five hundred quid a year anyway it's just it's not even here nor there erm
A	mind you if they'd have to take it down the spiral stairs then wouldn't they? they wouldn't be pleased about that
B	no cos they could us the big stairs in front of them no? just use the inner door of the foyer
A	yes I suppose so
B	mm
A	that's true
B	anyway erm I think that's enough to be going on with erm I can't think of anything else that we need to discuss obviously erm I'm on holiday a week today
A	yes
A	yes
B	erm the only days that they're not doing split shifts is Tuesday and a Thursday so he's not gonna check erm the computer on Tuesday or Thursday cos he's not gonna have time
A	right
B	cos it's a really busy day but Monday Wednesday and Friday
A	yeah
B	he's gonna do an hour or an hour and a half doing er emptying the voicemail and emptying the I will change in fact I'll start at the beginning I'm gonna change the voicemail erm in the office on the landline
A	yep
B	so he doesn't have to go into the office saying please leave all voicemails on the mobile
A	yeah
B	and then we give him the mobile
A	good
B	so for that hour and a half he can turn on turn it on
A	no no no but actually I think somebody should have your mobile your work mobile during that week not you
B	mm I
A	no no no but it's about answering the phone though it is about answering the phone
B	okay
A	I mean if if you don't wanna hand your phone over hand the SIM over
B	it's not about that I'm not bothered about the handset it's more to do with thingy that he's actually got a job to do on reception so he's got the security phone he's got that phone and then he's got the whole
A	yeah but I mean even if you just
B	mm
A	or answers it when they can or are just aware that it's rung and that there's an enquiry then I think that you know somebody picks up the phone and says oh sorry
B	yeah
A	and I can see that sort of situation turning up where somebody sort of says somebody phones up and says oh help help there's something urgent and there's nobody at the other end listening to the message oh yes cos
B	yeah
A	it was actually just phoning to the reception desk where he wasn't
B	right okay so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna put an office closed use mobile voicemail on on the office landline
A	yeah yeah
B	then
A	yeah
B	erm in fact the phone can stay in the box office
A	yeah
B	so whoever's on can answer it
A	yeah
B	when they can
A	yeah
B	basically just taking down messages
A	and if it's on the premises then they're not getting random calls at night which they don't
B	well yeah it can stay here then
A	yeah
B	and then when I phone the security phone
A	yeah
B	if I need to I can actually get any numbers that they've got
A	yeah
B	cos that's the only reason I don't leave it erm then I'm gonna get
A	yeah
B	so he can go into the hub sit at a hot-desking station and just and answer all the erm emails I'm gonna leave him a template basically with a can't take any bookings until such and such a date cos we can't we've got nothing available
A	yeah
B	erm and I'm gonna take basically sacrifice the one working day that we have got off that we have got free while I'm off just to say that we can't do anything with it basically unless someone comes down and pays cash to use the meeting room can't do anything
A	yep
B	and I'll just leave him a cut and paste erm response basically saying back on the second of November or whatever day it is so that's it erm and that's it there's only new business coming up for church
A	oh
B	church she didn't turn up for two weeks so I've removed her from the schedule erm this Sunday
A	have you double-checked with er
B	no not yet I was gonna wait until I get back which is giving her three weeks so then if she's really ill or something and she's just not bothered to tell me
A	yeah
B	she'll be better by then and she can come back
A	yeah
B	if she doesn't come back for the first week of November I've already lined up a church to go in her spot
A	oh really?
B	yeah
A	oh that's really good
B	so
A	and they're paying more I hope?
B	oh they will be paying
A	and they're and they're and they're gonna pay in advance?
B	they'll they'll pay more they'll pay upfront basically
A	yeah
B	the way they should do because they'll be taking a bigger spot I think they want a three-hour service
A	yep
B	so it'll be a ten till two
A	oh brilliant
B	or ten till one or thereabouts
A	okay
B	so that's basically it that's all I've really gotta tell you about for when I go off erm
A	okay we've got seven minutes more to go
B	okay
A	before I it's an hour well we can
B	erm so that's all I've gotta do for that we've agreed that
A	yeah
B	for his erm rent deposit
A	yeah
B	and he's gonna pay that back
A	mm
B	for the guys erm I'm gonna give
A	right
B	I've told
A	right
B	so
A	oh er okay well I mean have you talk have you talked have you talked to him about what he wants to do?
B	erm how do you feel about him cashing any of it in? he doesn't wanna
A	ah you see there's er something you didn't have holiday and then he went sick
B	no but he's got a
A	yeah
B	which he's doing now definitely
A	yeah
B	but he doesn't want any more time off than he's got
A	how many days has he will he have by the end of December?
B	I don't know I would estimate that he's probably got er he's been here what? two or three months two two months yeah he'll probably have about three to four weeks I reckon
A	what? he's not taken any holiday?
B	no he's not had any holiday no
A	oh christ
B	he's just done loads of days straight as well so what I'm suggesting is if he's got four weeks coming
A	yeah
B	that we let him use half of it and let him cash half of it in
A	yeah no I think that's a good compromise actually that gives him a nice bonus and it says thank you to him for working so hard and then we should also give it to him at Christmas so that he's got something
B	okay
A	nice for Christmas I think yeah so
B	right all holiday to use in Jan fifty percent cash-in available
A	yeah yeah cos otherwise well I mean who knows what's gonna happen in January you know the er I mean
A	it'll be just be our luck if he goes off on a month's holiday and and then
B	well what I've gotta
A	oh when's his when's his baby due?
B	that's what I was coming to then what I've gotta do is I've gotta sit down and find out with
A	yeah yeah
B	because I know that'll be the next issue
A	and is she in
B	she she is and she's gonna be up there until she's had the baby
A	that means he's gonna go at a moment's notice he's gonna just phone you up and say I've got to go to
B	most likely
A	oh bugger
B	what I've gotta do is I've gotta sit down with
B	erm for
B	into next year so when she finishes
A	mm and you do remember of course that on every day that the building is closed you have to take a day's holiday? part of your holiday is the days on which the building is closed
B	oh yeah my
B	my thirty days are including the
A	twenty-third twenty-fourth and
B	yeah
A	twenty-eighth twenty-ninth or whatever the working days are is part of your holiday
B	yeah
A	mm
B	well er I'm actually thinking I'm actually erm going away two days before we close this year we're not closing much next year will be a bit of an issue cos there's a two-week close-down pretty much this year
A	mm
B	this year it's
A	how do you work that far ahead? this is ridiculous
B	just because
B	the head it's it's
A	the hands
B	just just about Christmas really
B	two thousand and fifteen I dunno I'd like to be in India that'd be great
A	a cruise?
B	erm if I could afford it I'd be in India er I'm not gonna be though
A	oh
B	erm
A	yeah
B	his holiday balance is X
A	yeah
B	and he can cash fifty percent of it in but he's gotta use or take the rest of it in January or lose it and then next year
A	er well er er actually before you do that though talk to
B	oh yeah that's
A	it it might be it might be sensible to say to
B	yeah
B	no it's it's not that soon it's not that soon
A	isn't it?
B	I think from when
A	okay okay
B	I think
A	alright but then perhaps
B	it does say it but I'm not gonna enforce it to the point of like giving him grief because it's his first time here and he's just done us a favour
A	well the thing is yes he has only just joined here and we've worked him really hard and we
B	yeah
A	so
B	well I
A	mm
B	basically
