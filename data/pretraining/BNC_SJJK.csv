A	oh hello
B	so
A	but I think places like this
B	mm
A	yeah
B	yeah they might get the
A	people wandering in
B	yeah I mean I would pop in for a coffee when I'm Lidling and actually I would be really happy to meet you here if you fancied a coffee I just hope the next one is not in a paper cup
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	a pound's worth of mug just pop it in there it would good
A	we could write our names on them
B	yeah my friend
A	that's nice
B	that doesn't last though does it?
A	yeah write your name on it in nail varnish
B	so nail varnish survives the washing up?
A	but I would still just use someone else's cup anyway
B	yeah
A	I don't think it matters yes so confession time a strange confession
B	mm
A	I think I need to tell somebody
B	okay that's your Catholic upbringing
A	but for the last or two or so years I've had this weird addiction to this medication and I've decided to stop taking this medication it's not a physical addiction in that there's nothing chemically inside this medication that makes you need to take it it's like a psychological addiction to it where if you
B	mm
A	yeah
B	oh okay
A	and I'm starting to think eventually my nose is just going to like fall off
B	fall off
A	yeah a coke addict yeah
B	like a big hole in it or something yeah okay
A	so you know which is why me and
B	oh you didn't go and get it?
A	no we did we did
B	oh you did okay
A	and I'm hoping that with a mixture of that and sort of willpower I will be able to break this habit but I was googling it I've googled it in the past I googled it again today and it's like loads of people are saying I've been addicted to this for ten years
B	mm
B	yeah
A	but I'm just trying to break this habit so it's really awful because it means that I can't breathe through my nose until I learn to breathe again without relying on medication to help me breathe so it's just going to be
B	yeah
A	they are saying like a few weeks but people are sort of going on it
B	yeah
A	yeah so I'm hoping that in a couple of weeks
B	yeah that you will be alright again
A	yeah
B	that's cool
A	so it's rubbish
B	in the meantime yeah that saline stuff probably wouldn't hurt and also steam baths sticking your head over a bowl of hot water with a towel possibly with some baking soda or salty stuff Epsom salts I don't know can you breathe them in?
A	yeah
B	well Vicks is good but by god it makes you blind if you are not careful
B	yeah
A	yeah I know
B	yeah
B	what's next?
A	yeah I know
B	yeah good for you though just I suppose new year new beginnings it's erm yeah I mean you can recreate yourself at any time
B	yeah I was listening to last Sunday's Johnnie Walker's Sounds of the Seventies when I was cooking this morning and it was really interesting the first hour was dedicated to David Bowie and there were interviews with him sort of talking about inventing himself and becoming the character and things like that which I thought was just really interesting and quite wonderful and it sounds like he got a bit confused at some times as to whether he really was that character which of course he was if he was acting the role then of course he was
A	mm
B	mm yeah
A	mm
B	your laugh that people then take the piss out of because it's amusing so yeah
A	so I don't know
B	yeah interesting now I think my view is that as human beings we're dynamic changing evolving there is no this is me it's
A	yeah
B	are you positive about now?
A	I am I am positive about now
B	that'll do
B	no you don't you just do it now
A	yeah just do it now don't think about it
B	exactly just do it now yeah
A	that's good yes
B	yeah the future doesn't really exist anyway so yeah
A	mm
B	twenty-
A	yeah so it's twenty-one days to break a habit
B	is it?
A	possibly
A	or a hundred and two I don't know
B	oh I meant to send you those
A	twenty-one days to break a habit I'm sure that's true
B	Abraham-Hicks thing on Facebook the other day basically saying people say it takes thirty days twenty-eight days twenty-one days whatever to break a habit but actually it only takes a moment because there's only now so you have broken it now erm yeah I was going to send that to you I forgot I might have photographed it actually let's see if I can show you that without bollocksing up the recording let's have a look
A	he's got a lot of interesting things to say
B	no no I didn't save it to my phone
A	yeah
B	yeah but you know I do wonder if I've got
A	yeah
B	mm
A	it's like a second wind oh yeah there's another month
B	yeah
A	because then I'm relying so heavily on some of the negative experiences at the end of December I'm just you know you are using them to my advantage which is why I don't want that to happen again
B	mm yeah
A	well no it's not that I don't want to be that person because that's putting it on me and I don't think it's me
B	mm well you still have a role to play in any situation
A	yeah yeah
B	so in some form if not in the physical world then at least in some sort of vibrational level you've invited a challenge at some level
A	uhu yeah yeah so
B	and in a way if you think about how good you are feeling now maybe you can
A	thank you it changed yeah it changed something
B	yeah yeah that's really cool
A	yeah yeah yeah so
B	mm how much of that is real and how much of that is psychological?
A	I don't know in terms of people don't
B	mm you don't get invited to parties or
A	yeah or yeah at the same time you don't want to go to parties sometimes because it will be more miserable or you enjoy yourself you don't want to bring other people down I don't know it's kind of a combination of things
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	I could keep this up for another month just because I've really sort of riding this wave of everything is okay and especially because we are on holiday as well it's sort of helped I thought it would be rubbish being on holiday and not being able to drink but actually it's been a bit of a godsend in a way because you can do things
B	yeah
A	yeah your days are so much longer because erm you are not I don't know lying in bed hungover or you've got the energy to get up in the morning
B	yeah
A	yeah and we've done we've done so much I mean I'm not saying if we had er
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	it's kind of taken the pressure off Thursday Friday Saturday eve for not being drinking nights
A	I thought today was Monday
B	because we meet up in the week
B	yeah that's true I need to remember it is Saturday for the bus timetable
A	I have no idea what's going on at all
B	oh shit I've done that before
A	oh my god
B	but no feeling good and I keep having these dreams last night's dream was wonderful and I quite often dream about buildings or houses and I'm exploring them or I'm renovating them and I look on these as part of my psyche or different aspects of self and the dream
A	mm
B	which I think is sort of my higher self saying it's time to have some fun because I associate kittens with fun and laying on the ground and rolling around on the floor and playing basically so there's I feel like I feel a lot more light-hearted than I've felt in a while so I'm feeling a bit more kittenish but I think I probably am attracting kittens as well so I expect some cats to be arriving soon little cats
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	yeah and physically I had a bloody good clear out yesterday with you know everybody has got that junk drawer well I've I've got junk shoe boxes and the junk wooden box and I cleared all of those out yesterday and just got two metal box things to go and that's all of the real junk junk tackled so I'm going to do that today
A	oh easy-peasy yeah
B	hey
A	yeah just happy happy
B	that's good
A	yeah
B	simple is good as well
A	you don't need to be doing and drinking and
B	but you aren't doing
A	yeah
B	because you are gyming
A	yeah man
B	are you walking?
A	I had a lovely gym this morning it was so nice
B	good what did you do this morning?
A	I'm just trying to work out what is really the best thing to do if I've got this man for two hours a week and it's really sort of intense heavy stuff that takes up time to recover and some time to sort of build up to I don't want to be doing too much sort of lifting stuff on my own
B	mm
A	yeah so I was just doing lots of yeah cycling and climbing endless stairs
A	yeah and I hate it's been miserable no it doesn't make me miserable I'm not very good at it so I need to practise practise and practise it's one of those sort of things where your body really responds to it quite quickly but you have to do it you have to do it a lot or otherwise your body won't learn
B	mm
A	yeah you need to breathe through
B	yeah don't forget to breathe it sounds so stupid but people just do
A	uhu
B	good
A	to have someone chatting away in my ears
A	uhu
B	and I like eighties I do like it so I've got seventies and then I've got a little bit of nineties and a lot of noughties
A	uhu
B	oh no
A	yeah only one gym towel that's like that sort of not so big but it you know drowning you
B	oh okay
A	yeah
B	mm
A	is that two o'clock? how has that happened?
B	ah it's magic it doesn't exist anyway
A	it does
B	it doesn't it's now
A	oh god there's so much to do
B	the time is now what have you got to do?
A	I'm kidding I don't have anything to do
B	there you go
A	yes so
B	yeah well send her a message from my Polish phone what sort of time three?
A	yeah whenever she is ready I suppose
B	yeah that's cool and then
A	I've got no plans until eight
B	are you hungry?
A	I'm always hungry
A	I'm lazy
B	how do you do the projector thing? is that
B	yeah anyway where were we?
A	if you text her
B	mm
A	ask if she will bring her laptop
B	yeah
A	because mine is really tiny for watching and yeah hers is is sort of a normal-sized one
B	okay
A	yeah it clicks
B	I know
A	well someone is going to get
B	I think that must be so difficult when you start a business like that
A	yeah and you've just got to wait and you are so excited for customers and you have put all of your life savings into it
B	yeah I hope they know it's possibly I think they say erm the first year of a business you make a loss the second year you break even and the third year you make a profit and I observed
A	uhu
B	well no I used to say to
A	yeah
A	you know they've gone I'd
B	yeah so
A	hello
B	can you please bring your laptop?
A	very good
B	okay done
A	no
A	you can you go and do whatever you want I just
B	well no I don't actually have any good quality alcohol in the house I've got sort of I've got cooking whisky that you gave me left over from your party erm
B	I've got this white wine that I've just bought it looks like it's Russian or Slovakian or something there's some interesting looking characters on it and it probably tastes really awful erm and what else have I got? I've actually got another bottle of wine that's halfway reasonable and I've got a cherry liqueur thing actually I really a fancy a go at that
A	oh yeah yeah yeah
B	that's only fifteen percent so I might drink that bottle on the first of February throw up a bit get really sick and then decide
A	yeah remember why you stopped drinking
B	yeah so I think out of all of the booze that's the one I fancy the most
A	why not?
B	so I might just drink that on the first of February what day is the first of February?
A	it's a Monday
B	okay well I haven't got any students on a Monday right
A	no I I kind of think now all of my friends here in this country you know good friends don't care if I'm drunk or sober and the ones who want me to get drunk I think if you want me to get drunk then that means that you might not like me as much so why why should I be your friend?
B	mm
A	yeah
B	yeah to no offence but you could be anyone
A	yeah true
B	yeah
A	but we shall see
B	yeah
A	so yes
B	I'm thinking now I might like to sort of support you in you giving up your nasal thing as well
B	that would be really good to give up?
A	this is this is the hardest thing this is way harder than giving up alcohol or giving up chocolate or giving up fags or whatever else so this is like
B	yeah
A	so I just have to breathe through my mouth like a loser
B	oh I bet you snore something chronic at the minute?
A	that's what I mean I kind of don't want to either don't want to go to
B	yeah
B	you are going to potentially keep everybody awake yeah
A	so I just have to work through it
B	you've just reminded me of this really passive aggressive guy I met when hostelling around New Zealand he was this arsehole of an arrogant Essex man who was also hostelling his way around New Zealand on this large motorbike and he basically he went to the boss of every hostel and said look I really really really snore so you need to give me my own personal hostel room at the same price as a shared room bed because I'll keep people awake and you will get complaints and I just thought what a dick you know I mean he was kind of dressing it up as I'm concerned about everybody else erm but really he was just wanting something better for nothing he invariably got it so yeah I was thinking
B	yeah I didn't like his vibe so yeah
A	well there's a radiator
B	oh it's up there look
A	I can't feel it because I'm very warm in this sort of
B	yeah
A	oh hello
B	because erm I'm quite used to sharing with my brother
A	uhu
B	do you wake up with a sore throat?
A	er with a really dry mouth but it's only been one night so far
B	yeah it will pass yeah good for you though
A	you know these people on this website said like they only used this sort of medication once a day and tried to wean themself off it or they only used it in one nostril they had to do it that way so it's like
B	mm
A	so I'm going to try but it has been a few hours so I might sort of die before then
B	yeah
A	I just don't want to
B	I think cold turkey is the way
A	yeah
B	mm yeah
A	this is something that I need to give up but I don't really know how to approach the giving up
B	oh I don't know
A	I can't just you know pour him down the sink
A	or put him in the bin or give him to a friend until I come back
B	I can be really black and white about people sometimes and I can just switch off I'm not sure where that comes from self-preservation instinct I suppose
A	I know no I can it's like I did it before I can switch someone off like a light switch but I'm never very good at sort of telling them I just go cold turkey with people in the sense that I never speak to them and if they text me I don't reply and if they call me I don't answer and when I see them I blank them which is all horrible things that I shouldn't do
B	yeah
A	well because I don't think it is fair people sometimes need explanations and but I don't I'm not the sort of person I just don't have the capability to say this isn't working I'm not therefore I can't do it no sorry bye
B	mm maybe
A	yeah
B	yeah you've got to do it for yourself
A	yeah
B	mm yeah
A	I am the centre of your world
B	yeah I don't mean that in a completely self-centred way
A	yeah no no neither do I
B	but I just want somebody to really value and appreciate me and if they don't really value and appreciate me you know like you say as well as having their own life and their own interests
A	yes
B	exactly
A	but I want to be a presence and I don't think I am
B	yeah and to feel important and to feel considered and to
A	and I think I'm the sort of
B	is ending or has ended?
A	has ended is ending is ending erm you know I'm a sort of fair weather person it is like oh I don't know what to do so I will call this person it was like oh I don't know what to do so I will call this person or I need to get out of
B	mm
B	you might think in a relationship that you know the motivating factors would be more like yeah desperate to see you or not in a can't live my life without you kind of a way you expect the other individual to be exactly that individual who is perfectly complete in on themselves who brings something to the table so you can be a complete person they are a complete person but when you get together you're a kind of
A	uhu
B	I have
A	and I think it's because I'm working
A	no it's not that I want I don't want to be but I am have to be until I work out whatever this is whatever is going on and I think this is the sort of the turning point the sort of the pinnacle sort of
B	no
A	yeah and people who come into my life now will be because they are interested in this sort of strange sober person you know maybe I need a gym somebody from the gym because people are healthy and they don't drink and they don't judge for going to bed at ten o'clock because they are doing it too I think that's what I need and not an alcoholic
B	mm
A	not not change for you but you need people on a similar a similar wavelength or in a
B	on a wavelength
A	yeah
B	it is fabulous if it feels good do it
A	yeah
B	but be proud to be that person and the more you embrace and feel joy at being that person the more you will attract people to you who are on that vibe definitely like attracts like it's the law
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	so you know if you are playing a game of Guess Who? and you are putting down faces that's like a part of your board gone
B	yeah that's the first one isn't it? that's more than half your board
A	yeah yeah you are thinking I am going to try it okay erm
B	so most likely it's going to be
A	yeah
B	mm yeah within an hour or two bus drive yeah
A	and then you know you can get more and more specific into what you sort of want or like or
B	mm
A	anyway I need to go to the toilet do you mind pausing the?
B	can you do a pause on this?
A	otherwise you can sit and talk to yourself
B	can you do a pause thing on a recording?
A	I think you just stop and then you can just carry on again
B	can you? okay there we are
B	jolly good I sent
A	yeah I walked home from her house last night and it didn't take me long it took about twenty-five thirty minutes
B	oh that's not long
A	yeah and it was just a straight line
B	I should think it feels like ages in the van
A	yeah
B	yeah mm
A	yeah right so I'm just going to research this
B	yeah I might look at this bistro menu particularly where it says burrito for fifteen
A	I don't know yeah what we will get in it though
B	I know probably something dead
A	erm sure I was trying to see what else they have that is vegetarian and I don't think there is so much because even the salads have stuff apart from dried tomato salad but that's like it and erm there's potato cakes with with mushroom sauce
B	ah now erm
A	yeah and some
B	yeah
A	oh just some lip balm my lips are dead sore
B	do you want some Vaseline?
A	no I have I have
B	I've got loads of these tins of Vaseline
A	yeah so have I
B	I'm sure of them are like thirty years old
A	I've got yeah I've got because I never use Vaseline because I always hear mixed er reports on how good it is as a moisturiser and that it
B	I've got one that was going rusty
A	yeah stops stuff getting in but doesn't actually actively moisturise
B	no but I quite like that because I wonder with moisturisers I try not to use them because I think
A	yeah yeah just sort of
B	well yeah and parabens and shit but no I erm like hands or whatever for example I think the more you use a moisturiser the more you need it
A	the more your skin needs them yeah and I used to have really dry hands but because I've been like really hammering the water I haven't had dried hands and it's been like and I rarely wear gloves because I'm such a forgetful
B	oh yeah
A	hopefully the water
B	yeah that's cool
A	well we'll have a sit and maybe have a long walk home
B	yeah
A	I don't know how we can lengthen the journey er
B	in Lidl?
A	er anywhere I'm just trying to think if there's anything I need I've got tea coffee and milk
B	I like Lidl but I find I used to love Lidl in Northern Ireland every Thursday it was oh all the new things are in and on a Thursday it would be packed and I used to go on a Thursday because I used to drive a forty mile round trip to get the only organic vegetables that are available in the whole of Northern Ireland from the Holywood Camphill Community so I used to be uptown every Thursday anyway and call into Lidl and the quality was excellent but I find Lidl here the quality of all of the stuff it's all just polyester and stuff really give you bad electric shocks so don't go near anything metal so er yeah so I haven't bought hardly anything from the all the knicky-knacky new sections in the middle of Lidl but the Biedronka the Polish Lidl is brilliant and they have erm stuff
A	yes
B	oh yeah
A	yeah kind of or drive towards Gemini there's a Biedronka around there but I never think to go maybe I will be start going to Biedronka
B	okay
A	because I went to Alma on the way back from the court
B	I know because it's easy and you are passing it
A	for for kind of basically bits and then Tesco at the moment because it's next to the gym
B	no Biedronka is brilliant for all of their like bits in cages that are bargains in the middle erm yeah really good and also they are really good for Saudi things a bit like Lidl actually I found them in Lidl how you you get those tubs of
A	mm
B	yeah coleslaw or the carrot or beetroot or cabbage or whatever they might be and they are really cheap and really nice so yeah I tend to buy those in Biedronka and they've quite often got rows of pick and mix nuts or seeds or fruits which are pretty good as well and incredibly cheap I saw dried kiwis the other day which was really interesting yeah
A	oh how exciting
B	no
A	yeah or maybe it was in
B	oh the French supermarket
A	yeah I was somewhere anyway and they had dried pineapple but it was dead expensive
A	no that's Rossmann
B	oh Rossmann okay yeah
A	the applicator tampon
B	I'm alright I brought a load from England
A	yeah I I bought some the other day from Rossman
B	I've been really tempted to try a mooncup
A	yeah my friend mooncups erm and she swears by it erm I don't know how I feel
B	mm
A	but I think you know if you are sort of in public toilets for example it's just you'd have to take that and you'd have to take wipes just because you'd just you know
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	well all over your hands and stuff it's alright in the comfort of your own home but yeah
B	yeah I don't know I wonder I'll see because yeah I maybe when I'm living with a hippy dippy community it might be the way to go
A	yeah
B	mm
A	but my friend says it's no problem and it's sort of easy and quick and comfortable
B	yeah yeah
A	spur you on
A	yeah
B	well it is sort of is for me living in Poland because I do like my applicator tampons and I can't be doing with the non-applicator ones I mean biologically speaking it's just not happening quite frankly
A	well then I know but then mooncups are not far removed from that you still have to do a lot of poking around
B	I managed one of them what's that contraceptive thingy?
A	coils
B	no not coil is it cap?
A	like a dam is it called dam or something?
B	yeah I managed one of them for a year when I actually went out with a man and that was fine
A	oh sorry
B	anyway yeah so
A	good luck for transcribing that section
B	okey doke
A	okay bye
B	bye
