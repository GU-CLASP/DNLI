A	so if the cleaner's coming at two
B	well I think I can change the time it's not it doesn't matter cos I'll
A	mm
A	but if she
B	but really I could get her to come
A	if she comes at four
B	yeah
A	then is someone gonna be here?
B	I'll be here
A	yeah? well it's what time is it now?
B	or if not I'll cancel again and I'll get her to come tomorrow
A	it's Saturday tomorrow
B	well she said she'd work on the weekend
A	oh did she?
B	doesn't really make any difference
A	no no but tomorrow we should go somewhere shouldn't we? and do something
B	yeah that'd be nice
A	maybe well I I wanna walk to the theme park
B	yeah
A	check it out what's going on there
B	yeah yeah
A	cos the rollercoaster's working now you can see it have you seen it?
B	so we'll walk all the way there? or is there a bus?
A	you can see it from the balcony huh?
B	walk all the way there? or er is there a bus?
A	erm well I reckon it'll take half an hour?
B	when I was in the business district yesterday it looked really close
A	well it's about the same distance as the business district
B	bit zigzag
A	er not really I reckon it's probably about the same twenty-five thirty minutes
B	mm okay
A	it's not a very nice walk that road's a bit
B	no
A	horrible isn't it? and there's no other route you can take apart from the two main roads
B	isn't there? why can't we zigzag across?
A	I don't think they've finished building that road have they?
B	I don't know
A	have a look er erm yeah well they're still building that one past the business district they've nearly finished it it's amazing how quickly they built that
B	I know it is er
A	that's a big road
B	yeah
A	and it's literally they only started that at the beginning of summer didn't they?
A	that's like three months
B	no but they've started work on that other building as well again that one that we thought was
A	mm
B	a supermarket
A	yeah
B	don't know if it will be though
A	right so my options I don't wanna go to the girly lunch thing
B	tut I don't know if it is a girly lunch
A	well
B	I said maybe it's a girly lunch or maybe maybe all the husbands are coming I don't I don't know that's why I've texted to say what kind of lunch is it? a couples' lunch? or or a girls' lunch?
A	well either way I don't really fancy that
B	okay
A	dunno
A	so I mean really I'd like to stay home
B	a twelve o'clock start for a boozy lunch is quite early isn't it?
A	no cos I know what that means with
B	why doesn't he have like a late lunch? a three o'clock lunch or something?
A	that means a twelve hour session in
A	there's no way I'm doing that
B	what's the day today? Friday?
A	mm
B	Friday
A	erm
B	I think she's gonna have a little nap now
A	yeah?
B	mm
A	so I'm not sure what to do I wanna if you're going out then that's a good chance for me to make some music and do some recording
B	so does that mean the cleaner can come at two?
A	well she does all the ironing in there
B	oh okay well you can bring the ironing board in here that doesn't matter she's done it on the dining room
A	yeah
B	before
A	I only want a couple of hours I could do it now
B	yeah
A	what time are you going did you say?
B	I don't I've
A	oh
B	no idea no idea about anything my phone's charging in the other room so I can't find out
A	oh okay erm oh I don't know what I'll do
B	she's grown a lot more hair
A	yeah she has
B	watch how fast that hair is growing
A	yeah when I was
B	just
A	I took that video in the bath earlier
B	yeah?
A	and yeah cos it was a little bit wet
B	mm
A	yeah just
B	did it look a lot more?
A	I think it's since the cradle cap disappeared it's started growing hasn't it?
B	yeah well it's suddenly had a burst
A	yeah it's quite even now
B	wow
A	she looks
B	look at your hair
A	a big girl now
B	mm oh that's a nice kiss thank you
A	yeah
A	yeah it's definitely growing look at it
B	yeah you're looking like a proper she's looking like a proper little girl now
A	doesn't look like a boy anymore
B	you don't look like a boy anymore
A	bald head
B	I never thought you did look like a boy anyway
A	no I didn't either but people see the
B	everybody else
A	bald head and assume it's a boy
B	bald head means you're a boy
B	yeah it is weird
A	cos that's a an adult kind of stereotype you're attaching to a baby
B	yeah
A	even though everyone knows that it's fifty fifty
B	well here maybe the pink
A	whether they've got hair or not
B	maybe the pink isn't a clue here because some you know blokes wear pink T shirts and stuff here don't they?
A	erm
B	like or or it's
A	I think the dress is quite a giveaway
B	well obviously not
B	you know pink's quite a colour for blokes nowadays isn't it?
A	yeah
B	the last five years or so
A	not not just here everywhere it's
B	yeah everywhere last five years or so
A	yeah
B	so maybe people aren't taking it for much of a clue
A	yeah but
B	anymore
A	flowery
B	it's not like blue
A	dresses and I think her face looks very much like a girl when you when you see
B	I think that's just because we know her
A	no but well I suppose we've got er kind of tuned in to baby faces now haven't we? I I couldn't tell before but now we've got a little rug rat
B	really?
A	yeah most of the time
B	er I wonder why that is
A	I dunno
B	well I don't know I got I can get it wrong sometimes
A	well you can tell by
B	oh I like her new hair I like her new hair look
A	you can tell by her eyes and her mouth that she's a girl
B	oh
A	hey have you got something to say? mm?
B	yeah when you can talk you can be part of this
A	tut yeah
B	oh I
A	yeah

A	why doesn't someone else start a business doing that? I'm sure they'd get a lot of business
B	yeah they would get a lot of business people can't and er
A	you know it's such a hassle
B	another another girl she's erm she's using her friend's Chinese ID card but her credit card on an account but you can't
A	mm
B	that means that that person can't have an account as well but they have to accept that they won't ever have an account because it's under your names
A	mm
B	she keeps rubbing her ears today I think it's her teeth
A	she didn't get water in her ears?
