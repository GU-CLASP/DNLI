B	okay you can keep them like that

C	no like cos I cos I could do it
A	oh
C	around those
B	no

C	yeah
A	okay so I think my chair is done which doesn't
B	it
A	it wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be
C	it's beautiful

A	uhu
A	cos er yes
C	and I think this is the best chair in the world
A	that one?
