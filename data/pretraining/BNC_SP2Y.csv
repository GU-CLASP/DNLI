A	what would you say my accent is?
B	well I don't know you I think you're supposed to decide yourself
A	oh okay
B	where were
A	just
B	where were you brought up?
A	sort of southern English it's the pronunciation really isn't it? erm
B	posh
A	queen's English where do you currently live
B	no I don't think you quite sound like the queen
D	I erm
D	my my cleaner
D	which it's quite interesting
B	mm
D	cos when I do the
B	mm
B	well I would have said you spoke standard English with a slight accent it's not a heavy one at all
D	no it's inconsiderate to be so why are the telling us to how to write the date?
A	mm
B	well I said er because er the Americans write it the other way round and they want to be clear what date it is I suppose but
A	mm
B	since there aren't supposed to be any Americans on it
A	date er yeah
B	because the person I talk to most is American
D	are they gonna put all of
B	I don't know
D	am I going to put
B	well that's a good question isn't it erm by the time
A	we haven't
B	I send everything
D	right we're done
B	right thank you very much ladies
D	that's fine
B	okay shall we ah right
D	very good
B	so did I do everything that I was supposed to do with the PowerPoint?
D	mm I think so let's have a look
A	did you send me the revised one?
B	er
D	yes but it was while ago yeah
B	well I certainly sent it to
A	I'm really sorry but I didn't open emails from
B	er I would have thought I'd sent it to both of you
A	emails from
B	no
A	spending my entire holiday
B	fair enough
A	answering emails from both universities so I thought right that's it I'm not gonna answer any more
D	no you're right
B	move that a little bit
B	and the papers
A	so sorry I didn't yeah
D	oh we could maybe you could print it out for her or something or
B	well that's a
D	it's alright I mean yeah
B	that's a printout erm so
D	right cos
A	yeah
D	that I need to confirm
B	yeah okay sorry
D	erm so it's confirmed that it's at the
A	is it a café?
D	it's
A	yeah when I
D	when what?
A	when I looked it up on Google it said
D	well it is a café it's er it's a but it's a bigger than a café
A	yeah
D	it's a an art centre
A	oh right
D	it's like
A	oh oh is it?
D	but smaller than that
A	oh I haven't been there
D	I mean it's an old school actually
A	mm
D	it's a former former school
A	oh right
D	and erm and so it's there and the title of it is has changed as Success in International Business through Effective Communication we've said these timings to them and they have now
A	yeah
D	so that's the description of what's on
A	yeah
D	just so we know
A	is that what you sent us earlier on today?
D	yeah I can't
A	yeah
A	er might have done
B	yes
A	I think so yeah
D	erm so we know what the timings are
D	but she had only just put it on and erm and so could I let other people know about it so I contacted businesses and employer engagement here and everybody for them to promote it but then I emailed them back actually and said do you do you know have you any
B	mm
D	because erm it you asked us for it so I thought you you must have thought there was a demand
A	mm
B	mm
D	erm but she hasn't got back to me about that but I just the main reason I wanted to say that to her was actually was because what I don't want them to do is they've paid us some money to prepare this and do the things that we've done and what I don't want them to do is start saying well as if this doesn't run that actually we'll get you to prepare something else because they've had our money now because
A	yeah
D	we've prepared it and they can use it another time
B	mm
A	yeah
B	yes
D	and now I've already emailed them and said we you know we've
A	yeah
B	yes
D	so erm
B	well we've all put some time into it
D	yeah so if it doesn't run I think it will I think I think we'll get some people in
A	yeah
D	but erm I mean if it doesn't run then we could offer to run it again in the future some time but erm
B	do they have a minimum number of people on?
D	I don't think so because I mean when I went to the China one there were there was
B	mm
D	as far as I could tell and that they were there making the numbers up I think
B	mm
D	and that was with the China and me you know
D	and do I count? so that sounded like
B	see the one that I went to there were at least twenty people there I would say
D	mm
B	so that's a quite quite a different thing
D	the Mexico one I went to had been a roomful
A	I mean it's the time of year for people booking they people are just back from holiday since the bank holiday and all the rest
B	I would think that there'll be
A	they they they
B	that people won't start booking until next week
A	probably haven't got round to it yeah
B	yeah yeah
A	yeah
D	mm I said that to her as well I said people have been away and they won't have realised yet so right so then so we've got the structure there and so I suppose what we could do today is just go through the structure of what
A	mm
D	you know where just go through it as as if we were doing the day and see what's what the er so this is the first thing is
B	yes
D	but we I think we should keep speaking the same language on it even though it's not on the official title and then push successful what is the title that we call it now?
B	success of international business through
A	that's more a subtitle isn't it that one?
D	oh yes so success in international business
B	so
D	yeah so effective communication
A	could that not go into the or is it too late to have that speaking the same language?
D	they won't put it onto the website they said that the
A	oh
D	they said it's too long I sent them those I sent them two or three options that we're looking
A	yeah
B	well that's okay there that'll look works it fulfils
A	for them
B	the same function as our subtitle
D	mm
B	and we keep speaking the same language
D	yeah
B	ahead of that yeah
D	okay there
A	mm
D	yeah erm so then I just wrote on this front slide as a notes thing erm about what we would do when that slide was up and is that the point where we say where we introduce ourselves
B	er yes
A	yes
B	I think that's logical
A	mm
D	yeah
A	yeah
D	so we'd introduce ourselves then
A	mm
D	so where we lived languages that we speak
A	oh
D	I kept them but we haven't used them I wouldn't put in
A	they oh okay we'll
D	people that do know
A	or
D	don't see it as very positive
A	oh well it's just the location though
D	they see but it's a rough area of
A	oh okay
D	so people won't necessarily think oh that's a really good place to be whereas
A	yeah okay yeah
D	so
A	shall I put
D	I'd why does it matter?
D	I mean I would just we'll see
A	okay yeah
D	you don't need to change it
A	yeah
D	cos if they're asking for it
A	yeah cos they're not gonna go anyway yeah
D	I'll just change it yeah
B	mm
D	erm
A	teaching experience and business experience so more or less that
D	I don't think the teaching
A	yeah?
D	yeah well just
A	country yeah
D	yeah country
A	international experience
D	so where we've lived the languages that we speak and business
A	well I've look I've worked in loads of businesses
D	yeah like lots of businesses such as
A	actually but that was the most recent
D	yeah
A	in Spain
D	mm
A	I was always going off to work in companies and businesses
D	yeah
A	and part of it
D	so it does say that
A	erm yeah
D	so if we just do a quick thing like that erm and then they would introduce themselves I suppose we could ask them to introduce themselves with their name job company which languages they speak
A	yeah
D	so any different
B	mm yeah
D	it's er interactive so so those are the notes that I made about the first one
A	introducing themselves will that depend on the numbers because there might be if there's twenty thirty
D	there won't be twenty thirty if we've got none so far
A	no
D	there just won't there'll be like five or six
A	okay well
D	I think
A	that'll work then won't it
B	mm
A	yeah
D	cos if there were more then we can't
A	could go on rather a long time otherwise
D	yeah if if there if there were more we just can't
A	they'd have to mingle
D	we just can't but
A	yeah
B	if the I mean if there were a lot
D	there won't be
B	I suppose plan B is that we ask things like erm
A	does anybody have a
B	have a different native
A	yeah has any
D	yeah
B	cos that's relevant
A	has a hands up if
B	yeah but but rather than go round
D	yeah what languages do you use
B	and do all the names
D	yeah what languages do you speak and
A	yeah mm
D	yeah have you been living in the countries and things general stuff erm yeah so that was the oh and I did make a note here about name cards and there are a few things I want to ask
B	mm
D	people just put their first name on it so I can ask about that when we see how many people are booking and things
B	well again I I think when I erm sorry I don't know where the microphone is
D	oh sorry
B	where I went last time I yeah they provided name cards they were just there
D	yeah but whether they were there
D	because the facilitator brought them or whether they were there
B	right
D	because
B	right
D	presumably
B	yeah
D	er and whether there's a flip chart or power well PowerPoint's there for a start and whether there's a flip you know
A	yeah
D	I don't think there'll be a a
A	there won't be a white board no
D	a board so I think we'd need a
A	yeah
B	mm okay
D	yeah
B	yes so so all those sort of things
D	so I'll ask her about that
B	and we're leaving that to you to to sort
D	yeah so I'll just contact her about this at some point who sets the room up beforehand so if it starts at nine fifteen the registering do we need to be getting there quite a bit earlier to set it all up?
A	mm
D	or how is it going to be set up this kind of thing
B	mm yeah
D	what shape you know what
B	yeah
D	but I'll ask her all of that erm
D	in one email
D	and erm
B	right
D	it's eleven to eleven fifteen
B	oh okay
D	eleven thirty's a long break isn't it when people have got to get back to work
B	so that will be till twelve forty-five?
D	yeah
B	right okay
D	and it's using international English for effective business communication in emails and meetings
B	okay right
A	mm
D	and so what we'd said was for the first ten minutes more or less of your bit
B	mm
D	that we'd do the introductions then we'd do the agree and disagree
B	mm
D	for about half an hour so the
A	yeah
D	erm and
B	so we're doing that agree disagree thing while slide two is up?
D	I would put it do it while slide three is up because I think we're saying here this is the whole day
B	okay
D	and we introduce ourselves this is this is is your general thing
A	yeah
D	this is what's happening all of today now we're gonna do the first part of today which is slide three
A	yeah
D	so by then we'll have all introduced ourselves they'll have introduced their selves and we'll know what the session's gonna look like and there might be an extra slide in there about passport and export
B	alright okay
D	and then at the effective communication saying this so we're gonna look at how to make be effective in communication and then we hand out I hand out the agree and disagree
B	mm okay
D	so that now looks like this
A	mm oh yes that's better
D	but it's not actually I've made it purple now
D	erm because
A	we've gone purple
D	erm because I'm very corporate but part
A	that's much nicer
D	and partly because
A	mm
D	it does a bit of light blue so all of these bits
D	yeah
B	I much prefer purple
D	so I made it purple and actually it is a nicer colour than the
B	mm
D	the blue is the standard one that comes up when you open a Word
B	mm yeah
D	and it makes you look lazy if you use that
B	yes
D	so actually it is better and so it's just that one page now
A	why does why does that line go there and not over there? any particular reason?
D	over where?
A	well that blue extend to there but that blue didn't extend
D	oh good point yeah
D	yeah I didn't
B	yes
D	good point we'll get rid of that yeah
A	but it looks lovely
B	mm
A	yeah much better
D	so that's that and then well they'll just go through it and I'll let them fill it in and then
B	right
D	and then we can go through it and that's half an hour
A	half an hour yeah
D	so that is that right erm while we've got slide three up
B	and that's supposed to be
D	mm yes
B	yes yes
D	yeah
B	right
D	yeah and then we'd said originally in one of the previous meetings the PowerPoint is then forty minutes
B	yeah
D	and the email exercise is ten minutes that was the idea
B	okay
D	to get to the break erm so what have I just written here? so you've got these notes haven't you you've said all that already it might be worth in in when you're seeing it all this what you're saying here we're gonna look at the culture and how it affects communication and voting on email and all the stuff that you'd written in your notes to say and you know there are some handouts as we go along and handouts at the end or something like that
B	mm
D	but it's very clear so I thought
B	yes yes
D	I think that's fine
B	well er you I mean I got feedback on that mm and I think that's easy enough to read now and everything
D	mm
B	and it's about the right erm
D	so then we get to this one about Edward T Hall
B	mm
D	are you gonna say who he was is was how he was
D	even if you just say a one liner
B	it probably would be appropriate wouldn't it?
D	yeah
A	mm yeah
B	I mean what the the thing that I saw that
A	bit patronising
B	which well it was a bit not so much patronising as cute
B	you know sort of
A	yeah
B	it would be sort of
A	it's treating them like
B	the Japanese word is
A	yeah
B	erm
D	mm yeah
B	you know and I actually though oh I wouldn't have said it like that at all so yes erm and I need to think so I need to think what to say
D	so you could say Edward T Hall what so we're gonna look at Edward T Hall's categories of culture context time and space he was a culture an American cultural anthropologist who died in two thousand and nine
B	thank you
B	for talking about that bit
B	well now I knew what he was but I didn't know when he died
A	cultural anthropologist
D	you don't need to write all that actually cos all I need to do actually is just why don't I just shove this through the printer? then any any handwritten stuff I've got in here you'll just get as well won't you?
B	well it's alright I'll I can
D	I'll write it as well and then I'll print that up
A	mm
D	erm
B	it might not be a bad idea cos your handwriting is a hell of a lot more legible than mine
D	so I also wrote he specialised in intercultural relations and his ideas erm are very practical for business or something like that
B	yeah
A	mm
D	but really it's just
B	yes I mean you don't want it to look as though we're gonna hit them with a lot of theory
D	mm
A	no
B	but at the same time as you say
D	so I'm just underline the word
B	pro
A	yeah
D	yeah so what we're gonna do is look at his ideas and how they relate in a very practical sense to business communication
A	oh that sounds good
D	erm and then you're gonna say all these things that you've got in your notes here
B	yeah
D	that you're generalising and this kind of thing everybody is an individual I've said I've written here warning everybody is an
B	mm
D	erm
A	well you're very likely to
D	and erm yeah
A	to be honest not just could but
D	yeah you're very likely to yeah
B	yeah
D	and that
A	and
D	and that they're likely to have they could be in it they're likely to be in it it could easily be an immigrant and they're likely to have married if you know a different first language erm so yeah and then we get onto so first of all we'll look at context and
B	yes
D	so what do you think what do you think China might be and see what people say
B	well I guess so just
D	or what you think Germany might be
A	mm
B	just call out
D	cos like in a plenary thing
B	yeah
D	yeah and you'll light it up with the colours which is very good
B	yes
D	and
B	yeah
D	which is good
B	mm
D	erm I added a few extra things on there
B	good yeah
D	I put high context emphasis on not losing face I know you've written that somewhere but I didn't see it here oh cos I'd written examples do we want any examples
A	oh yeah
B	mm
A	I forgot about that one
D	cos you'd said er high context might feel that the lower context would
B	mm
D	this is like this
B	mm
D	but to act
A	mm
D	as if they've not done it
B	mm
D	and as if it's the first time and they do it's just an oversight on your part
B	mm
D	so something like that
B	mm
A	yeah it's difficult
B	yes yes I mean it's a good idea to have
D	an example
B	er various examples in the notes
D	mm
B	that you might or might not need to use
D	mm
B	because it depends what
A	they might come up with it
B	it depends
A	if they've
B	how responsive they are and
A	yeah
B	and how much they're coming up with themselves if if we're getting plenty from them and I'm look and you're looking at the time
A	yeah
B	then you know but yes
D	yeah so let me just write here
A	I mean in a way the examples are the most interesting part
B	yes
A	because
D	mm
A	because it's so sort of innocuous isn't it as I mentioned in my last email it's
D	mm
A	harmless for us really it doesn't
D	yeah
A	well I wouldn't
B	well I wouldn't no
A	would it annoy you?
B	if I'm
A	as I mentioned in my last email
B	I mean I had that last last
A	mm
B	erm
A	yeah
B	so I actually
D	mm
B	said that in my reply because it's making it look as though I haven't told her and actually I have
A	and I suppose yes I suppose it depends on the tone and the
B	yeah erm
A	the content of the rest of the email
B	yeah
D	but actually what this is saying which was what
B	yes
A	yeah yeah
D	in business that it's no
B	yes
D	that it makes them lose face so it isn't worth
A	yeah yeah
D	saying that but just
A	oh yeah
D	even though you're fully aware
B	so I think you very often when you do that you have got that sort of
A	I suppose so
B	self-justification kind of motive
D	mm
B	and and what you're saying is don't just think about yourself but because
D	mm
B	when it's in a business
A	but that's a really good interesting example
B	yeah
D	yeah and that
A	and ask them how they would respond to that in an email
B	yeah
A	get a you know
D	yeah
A	a bit of a bit of to and fro on that and well
D	and then they might say it doesn't matter I just think oh yeah fine but but it a Japanese person for
A	would take umbrage
D	take more might take it more
A	yeah
B	mm
D	because they're losing face it's a bigger thing for them
B	yes
D	so I don't really wanna give that example of something like that anyway
A	mm
B	yeah
D	er and that was everything about that and it's time then isn't it next?
B	mm
D	and monochronic time and polychronic time erm
B	mm okay
D	cos that's very hard to take up what that means
A	yeah
B	yes yes okay fine
D	er so what an example that I was reading about the other day was erm but it might be on the next slide actually that you say this but that a Brazilian for example if he knows he's got a meeting he might sort of and he's talking to somebody he might just meet he might carry on his conversation first and then arrive a bit late to the meeting
A	and it would be rude to cut them off
D	it's more important than getting to the yeah
B	mm
D	wouldn't wanna cut them off get to the meeting slightly late cos flexibility of meetings don't start on time anyway in our culture
B	I don't think that that's an example of
D	involvement of people over scheduling
B	that's involvement of people yes okay yes
D	I don't know about the
B	no
D	cos I don't really know what it means
A	mm no I don't know what I means either
D	so I don't
B	er I think that that well my understanding was that they're looking at
D	no
B	but I think this process of transactions is that that rather than worrying about we've got to get it all done by Tuesday it's we need to do it successfully and so that Johnny's involved and Sarah has her say and so and so gets a chance to show what they can do so it's more about
D	mm
B	how the whole thing works and whether it works successfully and
D	mm
B	rather than whether you know I mean quite often if you're meeting a deadline
A	rather than a result mm
B	you can end up
A	yeah
B	because you just need to get something done by a certain time
A	yeah so it's about getting good centres then
B	yes so
A	people are in agreement
B	that's that wasn't that was my understanding of
D	but it's not necessarily about successfully then is that it it's about because it can still be successful even if you miss some people out it just the end product might be successful
B	mm
D	it's just the that the people
B	but it's that
A	yeah
B	the process needs to be successful
A	the process
B	as well as the end product
D	yeah yeah
B	I suppose is what I'm thinking yes
A	mm yeah
B	yes
D	yeah cos the people
B	yes
D	can get upset about it so it's trying to involve all the people yeah
A	yeah
D	erm
A	well that was on that erm questionnaire you sent us
D	mm
A	I did try that one about you know whether you thought it was better to get things done or
D	oh yeah
A	ensure that everybody
D	everybody's involved
A	yeah
D	yeah
A	I didn't really have time to read all the results but
D	mm
A	I will do I've printed them out
D	mm
A	yeah
B	so I other words you've put that question mark there so that needs a little bit more explanation
A	mm
B	which I think is fair enough yeah
D	mm yeah yeah okay
B	it's very abstract that
D	but I mean the thing about finishing the conversation before you know that you might get to the meeting a bit late
B	oh I'm not saying that that that's
D	that could come next anyway
B	yes
D	cos we've got the example
A	mm
D	er so that's fine and then the implications for business about time and it well you'll ask them what you know what they think
B	mm
D	but I added extra things
B	good right
D	I put value
B	yes I think that's probably the best thing to do I haven't got the space
D	value spontaneity and improvisation
B	mm
D	so whereas we in polychronic cultures they've like Spain
A	mm
D	oh you now everything goes wrong when I go to Spain to give a talk but but it doesn't really matter cos that's fine it's all part of what happens and things so it doesn't matter that the the room is locked that we've gone to and then it all gets delayed and starts late and that
B	mm
D	and that the students are in a different place that it all ends up fine in the end and in fact that's the good thing about us that we can manage to
D	improvise
A	mm
B	mm
D	and and so
A	mm
D	so life isn't and you've said be flexible as the start and end time of meetings but I think it's because they view life as flexible view time as flexible so life isn't predictable so why bring why being why be so precise about schedules?
B	mm
A	and it's extremely annoying
B	mm
D	but only if you're not from a polychronic culture
A	but it but it
B	yeah
A	well yeah but
D	I don't find it annoying
A	but it's I've been
B	I do
A	for then ten years but
B	yes
A	and then it was like everything was thrown out and you know
B	mm and I don't think that's
A	and then I thought and then when they arrived they arrived like a whirlwind you know and and that it didn't matter at all like you say
D	yeah
A	they sort of managed to make it
B	I don't think that's just Spain though I think that's people who text
A	mm
B	because I have the same problem with English people that I know
A	yeah
B	and they don't seem to realise that that is actually throwing me out
A	mm
B	because I've organised my life around the time they said they were going to come
D	that's cos you're monochronic you see
B	yes I'm very monochronic
D	and time don't time is something that is gets wasted or lost or
A	yeah
B	well it's such that I from a practical point of view if you're cooking a meal from for somebody it's gonna be dried up in the oven if they arrive three hours later than they said they would
A	well in
D	mm yeah the way we do it yeah
B	but you know
D	the way that we do
A	the way the Spanish do it they wouldn't would it cos
D	they would they run it that way cooking them
A	they don't even they didn't I've been on Spain where they've invited me for a dinner and they haven't even started the shopping when I've arrived
D	yeah
A	they all set off to the supermarket to buy the stuff for a barbeque
A	and they I mean er one one place we went we were by the seaside and we just well all we wanted to do was eat and go to the beach and it went on and on and on and on and on and on and eventually we got to the beach about seven o'clock when they thought it was perfect time cos it was cool
D	yeah
A	you know and there was the people had left the beach and
B	right yes
A	oh
D	yeah so it is just a different
A	yeah
D	so it's so like as life isn't predictable why be so precise about schedules? schedules aren't important they value relationships with the people which we mentioned before
B	mm
D	so making schedules erm a
B	mm
D	so they'll all meet each other in Morrisons' car park and make sure that they've all got there
B	mm
D	and if one person's really late
A	yeah
D	they'll still wait for them rather than getting with the schedule whereas
B	mm
D	we would be saying oh we'll go along you come along later
A	yeah
D	but they'll not let that one person come along later though
B	mm yes
D	erm so they emphasise the being rather than doing he said make sure everyone who should be involve is involved which we mentioned just before hierarchies and stuff a Brazilian might be offended by the UK's insistence on punctuality or getting straight down to business
B	mm not so much offended as irritating I think
D	irritated yeah
B	but I mean that can then mean that they show that irritation
D	mm
B	and that can that could escalate
A	don't you think it's interesting how the British sort of you know we don't get down to business immediately we always have like a minute don't you find at every meeting
D	mm
A	there's always a minute or two however formal the meeting of friendly chit-chat and then immediately it's down to business
D	yeah
A	it's like you have that bit don't you?
B	where you switch
D	yeah
A	and you get really annoyed well if it goes on and on and on
D	too long
A	yeah too long that bit cos you wanna get down to business but it seems like too abrupt to suddenly do it
D	mm
B	mm
A	but other cultures don't do that
B	mm
A	they they don't know what's going on when we have our little chit-chat they think it's a social thing but it's not it's part of the
B	mm
A	part of the official part of the meeting in a way isn't it?
D	yeah
A	it's become so
D	it's yeah
A	I think that's really interesting
B	mm
D	but you can't have it on too long like you say
A	mm
D	cos otherwise it becomes
A	yeah eats into your your time yeah
D	and some and yeah and eating you know the fact that something eats into your time I don't think Spanish people more Spanish that I know would even think about thinks eating into their time
A	they don't no they don't
D	you know our concept that it can be wasted or used in that way er
D	and some traditional time management programmes and books for businesses here don't necessarily work well in
B	no no
D	cos it's all about doing urgent and to important and to do lists and things like that
A	mm
D	which just don't work in
B	mm
D	you know erm and then monochronic on the monochronic slide you'd put emphasise schedules punctuality preciseness and to do lists I wrote
B	yes yes
D	erm emphasise doing things valuing productivity getting things done on time
B	yeah
D	so it should be managed planned and used efficiently
A	mm
D	don't we?
A	yes
D	when we're doing that whereas in Spain
D	they don't think about time in quite the same way and they're not trying to manage it
A	mm
D	and plan it all the time and so they're actually we what we would call not as productive cos somehow they're not do you know they've got meetings that
A	mm
D	so you don't even know when it's gonna finish so you can't put another meeting afterwards yet they somehow seem less rushed
B	mm
A	mm
D	so
B	mm
D	so
A	yeah
D	and feel more rushed than them
D	so erm so what issues would you predict? erm and you elicitate with everybody yeah
B	mm yeah yeah
A	mm
D	I also here don't you mean P time there? the P time people are pressurised by constant reminders?
B	no I meant
D	mm
B	which is why you were quite right when you said that rather than having this P time and end time you
A	mm
D	yeah
B	you need and I but I I haven't done it in the notes
A	mm
D	mm
B	so yes you're right
D	so yeah so that's well
B	yes
D	it's just some thinking to think about later
B	yeah
D	that on that slide it's P time er and then it's space
B	yes
D	erm mm
B	no I just kind of
D	but I don't think it matters
B	because a lot of them are the
D	yeah
B	I mean not always like Japan as you say is high context but
A	mm
B	I taught this summer I taught Spanish people in July and Japanese in August
B	and it was
A	yeah yeah
B	amazing
A	and what about the Spanish they drift in and
B	well they were actually they weren't bad because they were teachers
A	oh yeah
B	rather than students but they certainly weren't all there at nine-thirty no
B	mm
A	the
B	yes but I didn't think that I
D	yeah I think you're right
B	particularly since it's a lot of the same
A	yes I agree I agree
B	countries
A	yeah
B	that's why I didn't bother
D	yeah
A	mm
D	no I think you're right I think you're right about that erm then you say personal spaces are figurative rather than a literal sense
B	mm
D	and I think
A	they won't
B	no well I mean
D	get
B	I would explain what that meant
D	right okay
B	yeah
D	yeah erm how would you
B	that isn't a script
D	oh right that's just you explaining it
B	that is notes
A	mm
B	yes
D	yeah yeah so you'd just say it
B	er
D	so that is that I don't think there's anything else to add there
A	it is partly physical though isn't it this didn't that you stand there
B	that's that's yes but that's a different that
A	mm mm
B	I mean maybe they do
A	mm it's quite relevant to meetings and things isn't it yeah
B	that is also relevant yes
A	yeah
D	yeah the highest space ones maintain social distance and and the low space ones will allow to be closer but whether you actually are physically
B	that's what I that's what she's talking about
A	yeah
D	I think you are
B	I would think that there probably is quite a strong correlation there
A	yeah
D	yeah
B	but I don't actually know so
D	mm
A	mm
D	but I would imagine so
A	yeah
D	er and so let's so you explain them and then what the implications are there for business the importance of interpersonal exchange interesting in long term relationships over short term gain so my example was it's not just about the making the sale now but
B	yes yeah
A	mm
D	but building up that relationship
A	mm
B	yeah
D	erm and you had that example about when you were invited out for dinner with some students and erm actually with a student do you remember? you were invited out for dinner with a student and you weren't sure what it was why the student had invited you out
B	mm
D	you were a bit worried that cos it was a
B	it was a senior executive at
D	oh right
B	not a boy
B	erm and and when I got there I immediately knew it wasn't a date because he introduced me to his mistress
B	and since I knew someone who taught his small children and therefore knew his wife I was really quite and quite offended by the whole thing but I couldn't say anything
D	and how did you know it was his mistress then cos you knew his wife?
B	cos he introduced me er this is my girlfriend
A	oh
B	and she's twenty-three
D	see there's an example for you
A	mm
D	about
B	and it was and the most important thing about her was the fact that she was twenty-three she was quite ugly
B	in my opinion but she was twenty-three and he was in his forties and you know
A	well there you go
B	er and then he took me to this host took us we went to eat and then we went to this hostess bar which okay was because
A	mm
B	where he went so he was there with his girlfriend and
B	one of the erm girls was from Taiwan so she and I had a little conversation in Chinese about the whole thing
B	it was quite interesting nobody else could understand
D	I mean it's a good example not necessarily in so much detail
B	no
D	but it's a good example of how you just you know you don't quite know what but actually his whole thing was erm that he was
A	mm whereas anybody else would from another culture would just ask straight out wouldn't they?
D	would just ask
B	mm
D	yeah that's it
B	yes
B	yes if that had been in Germany
A	yeah
B	they'd just have said
A	yeah
B	you know so and so wants an English lesson
B	so we don't know what to think of it
D	yeah
B	erm
D	erm so yeah what are the implications for business? high space cultures tend to focus on task and maintaining social distance as you say distinguish more between work life and private life erm and you've left the space bubble the bubble empty cos it's more about what you're not talking about it's that
B	mm
D	you're not talking so much about private life and things like that
B	yes
D	erm and I don't know when we were I've written here actually standing
A	mm
D	the UK the British person keeps moving backwards on the pavement
B	mm
D	you know I think it is actually
B	mm
D	I for me to have written that I have read that somewhere
A	mm
B	oh I mean that's definitely true but what I was reading was they did actually say you know we're talking for about figurative space rather than
A	literal
A	yeah
B	literally the literal space
A	well you could bring it up
B	but I would I
A	and you mention it
B	I I
A	ask around
A	yeah
A	see what people
B	certainly I mean yes I can remember my sociolinguistics lecturer at uni talking about that sort of thing
A	yeah
B	erm
B	yes
D	and that's
B	oh yes I've had that experience in China
D	mm
A	yeah
B	it was quite a common question
D	mm so things like that and then what issues might arise in email communication between them and you've got examples there
B	mm
D	rather than three different colours cos it looks a bit
B	well it was supposed to be varying from red to green which is what we've been looking at but I've
D	ah I see I didn't get that but
D	I like the idea
B	okay well if you the
D	I just wondered why is it in three different colours
A	oh yeah
D	so but you if you clarify that it would be fine what are you are you red? and
A	yeah
D	cos people might not have necessarily noticed
B	mm
D	so are
B	yes yeah
D	yeah and this is monochronic
A	mm
D	and low space
D	I think so I think the terminology can be a bit yeah
D	I can't remember it now
A	I don't think you need to remind them of the you know
D	yeah mm
A	what about you they'll know whether you're talking about
B	yeah
A	are you on that side or that
D	yeah yeah
A	you just need a physical gesture or somewhere in between
D	cos you've got the pictures haven't you?
B	mm
A	mm
A	yeah I wouldn't repeat all this bit off-putting
D	yeah so what what you know what about what's your attitude about time or er
A	mm yeah
D	space in really in your know talk about private lives in your or your thing about
B	mm
D	you know how important you know or just think
B	and are we doing that erm well I suppose it depends how many people we've got doesn't it? are we doing that as a open class as it were?
D	yeah if there's not many
A	if there's not many yeah and if there's it's all silence and they don't want to talk about it then then it could be tell your partner
B	mm
B	well groups
A	you yeah yeah
B	couldn't you?
A	that would do yeah tell each other
D	er we just ask people and then I I think they'll say something
A	mm
B	well by that point they've they've sort of been in the room for a while they should be warmed up a bit shouldn't they?
A	yeah
D	yeah
A	it depends how much they join in as it's going through I mean it would nice if they do
D	they might
A	yeah and sort of chip in with examples from their own international experiences
D	mm
B	well I mean also
A	they might or might not have that
B	if if we have had a bit at the beginning of which cultures they've had experience of and so on
A	mm
B	and I can remember who's
A	yeah
B	look at specific people and say when
A	mm
B	you know when you were in Turkey what did you you know that sort of thing as well as
A	yeah
B	erm what do you think
D	well you see if we have a flip chart
B	yeah
B	we might be able to get one of us might be able to write down somebody's name and the countries or something like that
A	mm
B	yeah
D	or just a few points as we go
B	I mean obviously
D	so we've got it as a reference
B	it would be good if we'd got some people with different
D	yeah
B	first languages
A	yeah yeah
B	or different cultures but
A	mm
D	yeah
B	yeah
D	er and then we've got the final quotes here
B	mm
D	er and then I've just put erm with the final quotes and so erm
A	yeah
D	they're all individuals
B	mm
D	but it is much more about everybody is of course an individual in every
A	yeah
B	mm
D	and that it is more about being sensitive to others and adjusting it to other
A	mm
D	other people's norms especially if you're selling to them
A	and also don't you think you know it's likely that as as business becomes more internationalised that
B	maybe
A	I think that's quite an interesting question of whether they
D	maybe
B	but
D	mm
B	but I think
A	mm
D	mm
B	and I think there's a danger if you're speaking the same if you're all speaking English of making the assumption that
A	yeah well yeah
B	that you're singing from the same hymn sheet
A	mm
D	mm
B	you know
A	that's quite a
B	I mean I've had that experience with
A	yeah
B	but being quite abrupt the way they would be in German
A	mm
B	and they come across as rude
A	yeah
B	and and that's why Germans have this reputation for being rude not because they are
A	mm
B	cos what they're saying wouldn't be rude in their own language
A	yeah
B	but in English it is erm and I think
A	yes yeah
B	that that they've got the culture right as well
A	that's an interesting point isn't it I think that's yeah
D	yeah
A	worth mentioning
D	and then I think the only thing I've written at the end oh I you I just I'd I don't think you need to put that cos it's just a lot of words to read why don't you say how many people speak the same language even when they speak the same language? do we need that first line even though it is his quote but does it matter?
A	let's see
D	after all when you come right down to it how many people speak the same language even when they speak the same language?
A	you don't think that we need that quote at all no?
D	I don't think we need that first line
A	no
D	I think we just say how many people speak the same language even when they speak the same language? and then you make that point that you've just made
A	yeah mm
B	erm well I wasn't necessarily going to read those out I was gonna leave them on the thing
A	yeah you could just leave them
D	yeah
B	if you change that you can't make that into a capital H that's the actual quotation you'd have to have a dot dot dot and a small H wouldn't you?
B	it's not the beginning
D	if you were academic yeah if you're in a business meeting no it just looks odd
D	you know what's it matter how exact your quotation you know he did say this it's just not the start of the sentence but it actually doesn't matter does it in a you know in in the rest of the world it doesn't actually matter
A	no
D	in real life whether they do or not
B	I don't my
A	they might expect speakers from a university in case they've been through the process
B	yeah
A	of studying and academics together but
D	I doubt well they're not even gonna know nobody's gonna go actually I I know that quote
D	and it's not the start of the sentence
B	no as I say I I was just gonna put the the slide up and talk rather than read I don't really believe in read reading things off slides
D	no I don't think you need to no I'm not suggesting you read it out but
A	just something to leave you with
D	to leave them with
A	yeah
D	yeah erm
A	in a way I mean in a way one would be better than two as a final thing to leave them with because
D	mm
B	well I put that other thing in because I liked both of those
A	cos once they sit in silence to
B	but yes you're right
A	it always goes back to the audience you're trying to reach and the way they think about their problems I think that one
B	you think yeah
A	just leave that
D	yeah I think that first one yeah
A	yeah yeah cos it's and then in fact if you were gonna have just that one you might as well have the whole one cos it's not too much
B	I
D	oh yeah
A	too many words
B	I think it's more
D	mm yeah
A	but that one's got it's nice
D	mm
B	but it is more rounded with that bit with that
A	yeah
D	mm it is more rounded I was just thinking cos it's a lot of words
B	it might be yeah
A	yeah
D	but but yeah just put one actually because we're calling it speaking the language that's good isn't it
A	yeah it goes back to the beginning
D	mm
B	yes right
B	jolly good
D	so that's a big one and then so you do that get to the end of that and then say so you know so we've looked at how this these different aspects of culture relate to erm the business environment so we're just gonna look now at a few emails and how to see this in practice with some emails and then we've got the handout with the emails and everything which is this one here so we'll have done that one
A	what time would it be here then? we've done ten minutes on the introductions half an hour on the
D	agree disagree
A	on the agree disagree
D	well for the whole
A	and then
B	so
A	that's forty
D	and then
A	and so how long for the slides to plan?
D	and then forty minutes on the slides
A	forty minutes okay
D	and then ten minutes on this final
A	yeah
D	or thirty-five forty minutes on the slides and then this final thing here which is this what
A	ten minutes
D	erm
A	I was wondering if there's any way I tried to do it but didn't have time to do it properly was is to get erm you know an email looking format pro forma or whatever you call it to put them in cos it would just look it would look much nicer
D	oh
A	on the page
D	mm
A	I don't know if you know how to do that
B	oh yeah
A	I tried for a bit but I thought I was going to be late for the meeting if I carried on doing it with my I'm sure you can
D	mm
A	but it just it would just look
D	mm it would be yeah you're right
A	yeah
D	it would look better
B	I'll play about with that
D	mm
B	and see if I can work out what to do
A	what would you call it? pro forma or
B	have you got the er
D	shall I send it I'll send it to you
B	yeah the yeah
D	to play with yeah
A	I mean it might just be a question of somehow dragging a copy pasting deleting and then inputting I don't know but
B	well I'll try I'll try doing that yeah
A	in the short time I tried it I couldn't do that but
D	you could somehow you know you could do print screen can't you so if you had it
A	oh a screenshot yeah
B	yes
D	you could do a screenshot so you could like create an email that says this somehow and then print screen and you'd get it but I don't know how it would work see how it goes but then so you would then need on this but I would think won't we just all as anybody else could chip in any time
B	at this point we'll all chip in
D	yeah
B	yes I think so
D	but it er what about during the PowerPoint itself?
D	you've always you've gotta be aware of the timing
B	mm
D	but it might help to move it along at times and things like that
A	what to chip in with stories?
D	if like we chip in at the same time
A	well I think so cos it varies it as well
D	yeah
A	but only if well
D	you won't know when I've got one though
B	no
A	well if you do because you've
D	but I think if we just
A	well you've been saying
D	yeah but she wouldn't know you wouldn't at that moment you won't necessarily think oh
A	mm
D	but I think it I would imagine we just play it by ear on the day and we're conscious about time as well so you're not
B	mm
D	chip in too many of of erm if we see the time's going and then we've got ten minutes to do this one
A	mm
B	I certainly think with any kind of thing when we're eliciting things from them or
D	try and let them talk
B	that that yes but
A	yeah
B	but it's fine for any to to
D	yeah
B	to chip in at that point
D	yeah as long as they get a chance to speak as well
B	you know so
D	so yeah and so yeah so then you'll introduce this exercise
B	mm
D	wouldn't you about erm the scenario and erm and why did they think and then I've put on the next page which we wouldn't give to them
B	no right
D	but the next page is kind of the answers that you might want to point out to them on the next two and that I think that's the original one so the next page tells you the answers is it that way so
A	yeah
D	so if you have a go at that and send it back to us then we
A	do you really think we can do this in ten minutes? cos even just for them to read them it's gonna
D	actually it's not
A	you know
D	it's gonna take more than ten minutes isn't it
A	it's gonna take more than ten minutes definitely
D	mm
A	for them to read them give their ideas and then decide
D	we need to shorten the agree and disagree a bit
A	I would say so actually
D	mm
A	anyway because
D	it's a bit long anyway
A	yeah yeah
D	or was it that was something I was gonna bring up earlier actually so let's say
A	or or ask them to look at the first
D	well they need all three cos it's
A	yeah they do no yeah they do need all three
D	so if we said that the agree and disagree was twenty minutes instead of thirty
A	mm
D	and then you've got twenty minutes for the emails haven't you? you've got twenty minutes to do that so that would be better let's do it that way
A	mm
D	right
A	twenty
D	okay so then so then you do that bit and then I have created this well you created it this handout here about and this is the purple that I'm gonna use
D	erm
A	oh that's good yeah
D	this erm this handout for them and on the back I've put some quotes
B	mm yes
D	bits of the first one and the most important thing is probably you know is
A	I like that that's good
D	you know what it is what it is he said
B	you could of course have made the outlines of those purple as well
D	I just wanted to vary it I did it on both
D	I just think it's sort of a bit boring if it's just all purple
A	yeah
D	but do you think it should be purple?
B	I don't think it really matters
A	I think I would centralise those it would look better
B	okay
D	oh yeah yeah
A	it's just
B	mm
A	you know it's just
B	well you've got the less
A	the way it sits
B	you've got your version with with those on
D	I'll do it
B	so you do it
D	yeah
B	and
D	and?
B	no I was just gonna say they're actually in they look fairly small print don't they but
D	mm
B	if you made it any bigger it would be a longer box
D	I'll look at that
B	so that's probably not such a good idea
D	yeah I see how it works
A	or could it be two columns there and one in the middle there I don't know cos they do look a little bit small compared to the other one
B	yeah yeah
D	mm
B	anyway
A	or
D	then it's hard to read isn't it
B	that is
A	oh
B	yeah that's
D	I don't think it
A	no it's just it's
D	so
A	okay
D	er and then I have this other handout for some point or other erm which is the
A	oh the one you sent yeah
D	which we were
A	mm
D	a handout at the end to them erm
B	mm
D	cos I don't know how we're gonna hand all these handouts out some of them we need to give them at the time cos they're doing it like the agree and disagree
B	yes
D	they're yours but others
B	I think that's probably at the end of the session
A	yeah
D	and the end of the session
B	yeah
D	but what do we give them to them in?
A	we need a little pack yeah which one erm
D	we're not gonna give them it I don't know what pack we give them though because we haven't actually got unless and
B	well is this another is this another question to ask her?
D	yeah
B	because ideally I would say that they should be given a
D	yeah
B	into it as well
A	mm
D	mm
B	or you give them the folder at the beginning with the first handout and say you'll be getting other things that you can put in there
D	mm
A	yeah
B	I mean either way would work wouldn't it but
A	yeah that would be good
D	yeah
B	but if we're supposed to be providing a folder then we need to know
D	so we'll ask cos we can't provide one cos you're not going to have one with
B	no
D	so I'll ask her if she's got a folder and if not we just hand these out at the end
A	mm
B	yeah
D	erm so
A	can we give some examples? when we
B	we've done that already haven't we?
A	we've done it
A	oh okay for maintaining good relationships
D	well but that's the whole thing by the time they get to this
B	I think this
D	they'll have had loads of examples from you won't they?
B	I yeah this is just
A	oh okay
B	a summary of what we've been saying
A	yeah so first naming conventions the use of first names or honorific titles
B	well this this is
A	diverse naming conventions
B	mm
A	and honorific titles sounds a bit
D	I've changed that now yeah I've changed that since yeah how are we gonna name that word that then? consider
B	oh I think that's fine
A	oh
D	I
A	yeah
D	naming conventions use of first names and titles not necessarily you know
A	titles yeah
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	very good
D	so I mean this thing at the end I don't know whether I need to put this if it's just a handout that we're not actually giving them then I don't
A	no
D	what would how would I put that? by the way
A	or
B	I would I'd just start with these tips are useful
A	yeah
B	and don't and don't put that way
A	cos you've you've said to cut out
D	yeah so those two are used for domestic email communication too
A	yeah
B	yes
D	or don't forget these tips for email are very useful for or these tips are useful for domestic communication too right that's that yeah
B	yeah
D	right?
A	erm well it's a silly very small thing but there should be a space after the ten point
D	oh yeah no you're right
A	yeah
D	yeah no that's good
B	yes they do me as well
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	and when other people write them
D	yeah
D	so yeah excellent thank you
B	yeah
D	so then er so that will be handed out at some point er so then after we've done your thing by this will be the break now so then we'll come back after the break and get a
A	the break's fifteen minutes?
B	mm
D	the break's fifteen minutes and then we're and then we'll be playing er in the second half I mean originally what we'd said was erm that in the second half we'll so in the second half we're looking at using international English for effective business communication that's what we're calling it in meetings and in meetings and emails
A	meetings and emails and I'm gonna start start off by talking about yeah
D	and this is where you start off and we say well first of all we're gonna look at using
B	mm
D	more than the language
B	yes
D	so actually we've gotta make sure we remember that that when we're doing this one it's not about looking at specific
A	yeah
D	well language items as that it's about looking at
B	yeah
A	yeah well that can come in the introduction oh yeah we have one yeah
D	the high context and time and that kind of thing but not specific sentences the way that they they word it but more about
A	culture
D	the culture so the first half is all about culture and you can say what it's about at the beginning of the day the first half of the day is about culture
B	well I mean that's when you're looking at the programme
D	yeah
A	yeah
D	and the second half is more about the language that we use
B	yeah
D	and so you say we'll be looking at international English and how erm
A	and meetings
D	I think international English has a capital I because it's it's actually it's like academic English
A	right yeah
B	it is yes it's an English language
A	yeah
D	actually you've put it in later so
B	that's right
D	that we need
B	yeah
D	that you need to get rid of
A	I know I didn't know how to
D	if erm
B	you click on that little thing like a reverse P
A	uh-huh
B	and all the spacing and everything will show and you then remove all the ones on the last page
D	but I I'll do it
B	do you know what mean?
D	yeah
A	yeah
D	I'll do it I'll I could do it on this one here
A	no well and you can do it by delete on somewhere and it just goes
D	yeah it just goes
A	but this today it didn't so first page I'll try a bit if not
B	well I mean it's something you want to know how to do anyway
A	well yeah it's true
D	mm
B	erm do you you know what I mean that thing that there that sort of so it
A	oh
B	and you can then
D	but do you know what it is?
B	delete those
A	I'll I'll find I'll find it
D	shall shall I
B	on across the top
A	yeah
B	when you're in home
A	yeah
D	there's a symbol that looks like that
B	about in the middle there's a symbol that looks like a sort of
D	something like
A	oh right okay yeah
D	like a P backwards it doesn't look like a nine exactly but
A	yeah
D	yeah
A	mm okay
B	and if you click on that all the every all the
A	yeah
B	appear on the in the document
A	yeah
B	and to get rid of them you click on it again
A	okay
D	and highlight it yeah so erm
A	highlight and click again
D	yeah that's enough
B	yeah yeah
D	international English is a simplified version of English used between business people around the world to help them I wouldn't say it's a lingua
A	I like that phrase though a lingua franca
D	cos we're linguists that's why we like it but
D	I just think god if I said that to like
A	okay okay
D	well
A	okay
D	but my dad or you know I just think nobody knows what it means apart from us
A	okay get rid of it
B	so used between business people around the world to help my communications so you don't
D	yeah
B	you just
D	to help make communication clearer and easier to understand
A	it's a bit the same isn't it clearer and easier to understand but I think it's
B	well
A	it's a yeah well cos
D	yeah and then you've got a bit about yeah we've said that
A	and you didn't want me to go into anything about international English establishing as a way of you know that as it's becoming the sort of way that people learn the language as well as the way that people speak the language you know
D	is it?
A	well yeah in a way it is if you look at text books and things not the you know the ones that are taught in the UK cos they're still teaching the English students but a lot of international
B	I think that that's something that's interesting for language teachers
A	for us yeah yeah yeah
B	but not really language students
A	I've got to I've gotta stop myself
D	yeah
A	yeah
D	yeah
B	yes
D	yeah
A	yeah
D	you know would you know the word chair or seat or deckchair or bench?
A	yeah
A	chair bench
D	deckchair and seat
A	seat deckchair yeah
D	seat
A	yeah
D	people
B	they don't know a deckchair they'll know the other three
D	and so
A	people understand you don't need all the
D	but you don't
A	and people and when it comes to the specialised stuff they understand it anyway
D	yeah
A	cos it's their their field yeah
D	their field yeah
A	erm
D	so yes so looking at these following extracts from emails and decide what you think the writer intended to say how could they have written it more clearly? so you're gonna ask them you see that's something I think you could just ask them to do with somebody sitting near them
A	yes
B	yeah
A	do it with a partner
B	yeah
D	yeah
A	er so start off this is you know these are people who are not using international English
D	mm
A	and have not presented their ideas very clearly
D	yeah
A	can you help them?
D	yeah
A	yeah
D	and at the beginning of when you start the second session off I would just remind them that you know in the first half we've looked at culture
A	yeah at that yeah
D	now we're going to look at language
A	yeah language yeah
D	yeah your written and spoken
A	yeah
D	erm so there's the activity oh and the timing
A	yeah
D	is oh you're doing half the time then aren't you? the other half of the time more or less isn't it?
A	yeah
D	yeah
A	I mean I I might not take too long
D	for that
A	because it depends how quickly I've reduced it a bit
D	mm
A	so I just you know I'm gonna try and go through this really quickly
D	but I can make it the other bit as long as
A	yeah
D	as we like and it doesn't matter if you finish slightly earlier and people get back from their fifteen minute break slightly late so
B	yes yeah
D	it kind of it'll work out
A	so roughly how long well it's er how
D	forty-five minutes roughly
A	for me? I don't think I'll need that long actually
D	because it's an hour and a half altogether
A	but but yeah
D	you know even if it's half an hour or something
A	mm
D	it doesn't matter so they'll decide this unless you fail to inform us
A	well that was the double negatives triple negatives
D	but nobody would ever say unless you fail to inform us
A	it's an exaggerated version in a way
D	but even if you said if you fail to inform us of your inability
A	yeah
D	nobody would ever say
A	well I'll change it if you like but
D	they cos cos nobody would write is that authentic?
A	it it well it was
D	yeah I don't think that I don't think anybody would ever write that I think they'd say unless you inform us of your inability
A	okay if
D	or if you fail to
B	no no
A	okay unless you
B	unless you
A	inform
B	inform us in advance of your inability to
D	well I would I would keep fail
B	that's still confusing enough
A	unless yeah unless you
D	I would keep fail I cos I think unless is far more difficult to explain to somebody whose native
A	okay if you fail
D	if you fail to inform
B	if you fail to inform us in advance of your inability to attend the event you will be billed
D	you will not be billed
A	will not be billed for those presentations
D	if you
A	have a
B	if you fail to then you will be
D	ah
A	well the thing is it's meant to be a little bit funny you know
D	it's meant to be unless unless you fail to inform us
A	yeah I mean the thing is it's an exaggerated version
B	yeah
A	and I don't think that matters you know
D	you will not be billed
A	but the point of it is that what do they actually want to say?
D	but I just can't get my head around it to my honest I can't the way it's written at the moment I can't even start to do anything with it's it's it's
D	it's so unauthentic and so many negatives that I just don't think anybody would write it
A	okay
D	and I can't actually process it
D	so
A	wait unless you okay
D	if you fail to inform us
B	well what it's basically saying is
D	of your inability to attend
B	tell us tell us in advance that you can't come otherwise we'll make you
A	make you pay yeah
B	you'll have to pay for it
D	unless you inform us actually it's
B	you will be billed
D	ah but then it's you will be billed
B	for those presentations
D	yeah
A	but all they've got to do really is I I mean I'll change it if you like
B	that's alright
A	but all they've got to do is put a clear message
B	yeah
A	and write
B	but I mean
A	you know
D	I just find it really hard at the moment because I just think that is so unauthentic
A	okay
B	I think if you
A	okay
D	that I just would I can't I wouldn't even able to process it
B	if you change that to unless you inform us you will be billed that's still quite confusing
D	mm
A	yeah
B	and there's still plenty of negatives in there and it's
A	unless you inform us in advance of your inability to attend the event you will
B	will be billed
A	will be billed
D	yeah
A	that's easy though will be be for the presentations where you cannot avoid missing yeah no that's enough actually I agree
B	no I think that's enough there
D	yeah and then yeah
A	yeah yeah that's enough you don't want to
D	unless you inform us
A	give them too much of a hard time
D	in advance of your inability to attend you will be billed
A	yeah
D	so
A	erm not to write anything but just to say
D	or to say
A	erm you know please let us know if you
B	if you don't
A	yeah if you don't if if you if you do not let us
B	if you
D	if I were you I would write it out first
A	we
B	yes
D	mm
B	probably make yes probably make two as you say we're doing there make two sentences
A	yeah
B	yeah please inform us before
D	yeah definitely yeah
A	definitely yeah
D	but if I were you I would write the answer cos otherwise when you're actually explaining it to them you'll you'll you'll
A	yeah
D	it it's hard to just think it up on the day
A	yeah yeah don't worry
D	yeah
A	I'll
D	I'm not convinced that this is really the best approach to this problem also I'm a little concerned about your the budget for this project it seems to be rather on the optimistic side
A	well because what they're trying to say is
D	mm
A	but they're phrasing it such couching it in such you know
B	mm
A	diplomatic language that the
D	yeah no
A	the real message is not getting across
B	yeah
D	mm
B	yeah
D	yeah and so what would you so you think about what you want to say
A	well erm
A	also I'm a little concerned about the budget for this project
D	so have a think have a think about what you would actually
A	yeah I will yeah
D	want them to say
A	yeah
D	but actually you don't need to actually you although you would leave it in here the answer doesn't need to include budget you could say I'm not erm oh I'm concerned about
A	the costing
D	the approach
A	yeah
D	and the budget or even the yeah I suppose that I'm concerned about the approach and the
A	yeah
B	I don't think they're very realistic
D	yeah I don't think they're very realistic
A	don't think they're realistic I can concerned
D	yeah cos this rather on the optimistic you know it's er it's optimistic it's very
A	it's very typical
B	yeah
D	it's very it's what people say
A	of when you don't want to hurt offend somebody
D	yeah mm yeah
A	and you want to put it so diplomatically isn't it and that's what they might do but it would not be there's no way anybody could understand that
B	no
A	however good their English was
D	yeah
A	they just wouldn't pick up the message
D	mm mm
A	and that's the point I was wanting to make with that one
D	yeah
B	yeah
A	so it's a
D	yeah
B	mm
A	because you know
B	it is language yes
A	because er a native speaker would immediate realise that
D	they're
A	that person who's not convinced but
D	yeah cos I mean the things like I'm not sure that this is the approach to this see even just something as simple as I'm not sure that this is the best approach to this problem
B	yeah
D	is enough I think cos it's like saying what you're saying is this isn't the best approach to this problem but
D	but you've still got to phrase it in a polite way to international audience haven't you
B	no oh well you're saying that's enough of a
D	yeah it's enough of a complication
A	yeah
D	I am not sure that this is the best approach to this problem
A	it means that you're
D	doesn't mean that you're not sure that it's the best
A	yeah
B	yes
D	doesn't it
A	yeah
D	erm
A	well do you want me to change it to sure but the but why because that's more
D	I'm not convinced
A	British though
D	yeah that's the same yeah it doesn't matter
A	yeah erm
B	I I think
D	this is fine though
B	it's
A	mm
B	I think it's okay
D	okay
B	I mean I know what you're saying is that
D	yeah
B	but er no I think it's er it's the whole thing
D	see I don't think you need the middle one I just think you just say I'm not convinced this is really the best approach to this problem it seems to be rather I don't know
A	do you mean make it a bit shorter?
D	just make it shorter
A	I'm not
D	problem er
B	well I don't I think no I think it's fine
D	yeah just leave it and then you just discuss
B	I think it's a
D	yeah
B	it's a good example
D	yeah
B	of a chunk of
D	of the
B	of that kind of person's language
D	complicated
A	over diplomatic
D	but then just think about
A	where the meaning's lost
D	way how you might say it
B	and the the whole thing is quite long
A	well what what what would we say then?
B	that mm
A	what would we say instead then? erm erm I'm worried about I'm worried or
D	see you don't necessarily even do we need to have an actual I mean you need to have in your head an idea but but actually what you would say in reality you know that it's just if you were
B	yeah
D	we know that people would understand it but they'd actually erm if you were saying it to
A	please can we discuss the budget for this project
D	mm the budget yeah
A	erm I I've I am concerned that we may need more you know something like that please can we discuss isn't it
D	yeah
A	you need a call for action
D	yeah
A	we discuss I mean I actually wrote an email very similar to this my niece sent me erm she's supposed to be creating a a book for my
D	mm
A	my father's ninetieth birthday and she's collecting all his writings that he's done all through his life together
D	mm
A	and having them published she it's on the twentieth of October and she hasn't actually done anything yet
B	oh
A	so
D	mm
B	yeah
A	it's like I think that's
B	yeah
A	allow for please ensure that you know that it does it doesn't
D	see maybe in this one you don't actually need to write it in a better like the first one you might say think about a better way to put it
A	yeah
D	what did they intend to say? think about a better way the second I know you're asking the question in the instructions but in this second one you maybe you don't need to actually have a
A	no
D	you maybe just need to get the get across the point that actually they mean this is a problem
A	yeah it's
D	and it's not rather on the optimistic side it's totally unrealistic
B	yes
A	okay so it's not how could she have written it more clearly so what do you think the writer intended to say? I could get rid of that second instruction couldn't she couldn't I?
D	well I think you leave it but you don't necessarily need to do it every
A	okay
D	every question necessarily
B	yeah well see whether they come with something
D	see what they come up with
B	I mean it is a tricky one
D	yeah
B	in that you
D	mm
B	you're being quite rude and and putting them down
D	yeah
A	yeah
B	but at the same time if you say it like this they're not gonna understand what you mean
A	yeah
B	erm
D	but you could say I think I think probably your answer is something to do with can we discuss the
B	yes so maybe a solution is
D	the quotes so can we discuss this problem and the budget in a bit more detail?
A	yeah
B	yeah
D	erm
B	so maybe so you can
D	but look at different ways to solve it or something
A	or yeah how to finish it
D	or something like that
B	yeah
D	rather than saying this isn't working say can we
A	yeah
B	yes
D	can we look at this again can we discuss this problem again?
B	so you can link that you know there's a language problem here which is not
D	right
B	that it's not
A	problem with language
B	if you go for really clear language you've got a cultural problem there
D	yeah mm
A	yeah to can we discuss this problem again and the budget in more detail to make sure that erm you know it well
B	well not even that
A	no
D	can we
A	in more detail
D	can we discuss this problem in the budget a bit more?
A	yeah
D	right
A	balance of
B	and yes I think it's a good idea to use a word like worried cos
D	mm
B	if you were going to you know
A	cos they will want to
B	I'm a little bit worried about
A	yeah
B	you know but cos
D	but even I'm a little bit worried is taking a lot
A	it means it's cast doubt on
B	yes it is it's true yeah
A	yeah cast doubt on the first the first but then that's that is what you want to say
B	but if you then if you then do that can we please discuss it
A	yeah it's it's actually calling for action
D	yeah can we please discuss it
B	yes
A	and that's the main thing
D	yeah
A	you you've got something you want them to do and that's always it should you know
D	yeah yeah
A	erm
B	and then please give me your answer by the end of the week it does matter whether I have it on Friday
A	oh I don't really particularly like that one actually please give me your answer by the end of the week it does matter whether I have it
D	you could either look for a different one or just have two
A	yeah
D	couldn't you?
A	yeah alright
B	but I think well cos I actually think that a native speaker would look at that and think
D	yeah when I first read it I thought it meant doesn't
B	it does mean does yes
A	but it's not clear is it?
D	sure
B	no
A	no
B	no I mean I agree it's not very clear but
A	it's not meant to be but I mean but it's
D	yeah
B	I'm not sure that that's a
A	no I don't
B	a native speaker
A	no
B	or a non-native speaker lack of clarity which is what we want to focus on isn't it?
D	mm
A	yeah I
D	yeah
A	but if you anybody else finds one they can send it to me but I'll look for another one
D	or just two
A	or just two
D	it gives you something which you know gives you enough to talk about
A	yeah
D	right and then all of this
A	I've just
D	there's been lots of examples how are you gonna
A	go through it
D	go through it mm
A	well I mean
D	I think you need numbers you're right yeah but put it in here
B	have you told your computer not to do automatic numbering?
A	no no but if
B	it's full of
A	I already had the grid you see
B	yeah but what I'm
A	and
D	but put it inside your grid
A	yeah I tried to I tried to yeah
D	put your number there
B	what I'm saying is
D	you try it
B	my computer doesn't do anything that I don't
D	you can jump you can jump them around then
A	oh I oh I
B	if it's not doing automatic
A	oh I know what you mean yeah
B	if it's not doing automatic numbering then you just type a one and a and a dot and a space and a two and a dot and a space
A	but for some reason it it
D	and it jumps it about and everything
A	it pushed everything around in the grid and it and it
B	but if you
A	it you know it went off the page and
B	it's should be in auto correct
A	mm
B	and you un-tick everything you can possibly un-tick it's the first thing I do when I get a new computer
A	really?
B	it drives me crackers when it's trying to do things I don't want it to do
A	I'll have another go er
D	but if you can't do it
B	if you can't do it
D	just when you've done when you've got your final version and you've changed your little bits
A	yeah I'll send it back yeah
D	send it back and just say to me put the numbers in and we'll put them in
B	yeah we'll manage it somehow
A	erm pit language pitfalls shall I put?
D	yeah
B	yes
A	mm
B	that was a good example of fronting
A	no
B	language pitfalls shall I put?
A	and how how should be should it how to avoid shouldn't be in and then shouldn't be yeah
D	no just I mean these days
A	yeah
D	people don't put capitals
A	no
D	for every word and erm
A	just the language pitfalls
D	I do wonder
B	mm
A	mm
D	yeah and
B	well obviously otherwise it's it will be as it
D	cos otherwise how do we go through it?
A	yeah
D	and maybe you could
B	the first three or
A	or get them to write some of the
B	do you think you could give them the first three or something like that?
A	yeah
B	and then erm
A	and then get them to write clear examples and then flash up the some answers so that they can compare
D	yeah
B	well we can hand out a
D	handouts
B	handouts at the end anyway
A	yeah
D	we can do that can't we?
D	we can give yours out at the end
B	erm
A	yeah I think do a few of them
D	yeah cos you could do the first four or something like that
B	so that the
D	so have it written in
A	yeah
D	erm
A	four together
D	yeah
A	and I might change the order
B	mm
A	of the first four
D	yeah
A	yeah
D	but I quite like this old-fashioned over formal thing I mean you
A	yeah
D	and let them think about the other ones
A	mm
D	cos I think it's quite difficult for them to you know
A	mm
D	I think it would be a
A	yeah
B	yes
D	good thing for them
A	yeah
B	yes that would be a good one yes
A	the first would go and and the
D	and the same with that at this time now
A	others blank sorry? are the same as
B	the the with the next one where you've got quite a lot at this time and now
A	oh yeah
B	and that one would be
A	those ones
D	and then you leave the others ones
A	yeah
D	yeah
A	yeah
B	erm
D	I mean but things like the abbreviations you'd just leave that one in as
A	yeah
D	and so
B	yeah
A	yeah
D	yeah
B	erm
D	they'll not
A	no
D	they'll not know how to do it yeah
B	for instance
A	yeah
D	so let's talk about the ones
B	but
D	that you'd actually put in I would put I I would give them this
B	yeah
D	as an example cos that's hard
B	mm
D	erm and
B	oh I had a question about about that one actually that by and then the before I find that sentence a bit weird
A	yeah
B	erm
A	please send me and advise
D	on on
B	and why not on Wednesday the fifteenth of August?
B	or
A	or just a comma when no because if you say on it's got to be sent on that day hasn't it? but I want
D	no cos it's by
B	no it's by
A	please send by me
D	by four on four o'clock in August
A	by four PM standard time
D	by this time on that day
A	I think you just have a comma
B	well that's kind of I don't
A	by four PM standard time
D	I would
B	an American way of doing it but but
D	yeah
A	Wednesday the fifteenth of August
B	but but it doesn't
D	I wouldn't I'd always put on
A	cos it otherwise it says it it suggests that you're gonna post it on the or fifteenth of August to me
A	no it's by
B	I don't think so cos the by
A	okay
B	of of the
A	okay
D	that time on that date
A	okay yeah
D	yeah so I would them that one and give them this one
A	they're quite a bit boring some of those they could go further down but they are
D	yeah you can move them further down
A	they are classic ones aren't they?
D	but I would give them yeah I would give them them
A	yeah
D	and then leave
A	erm
D	the dates the date one and let them think about that
A	yeah
D	leave that blank and see if they can work out what's wrong with that
A	leave
B	yeah
A	and leave blank and leave blank
D	and then give them the I'm up to my ears but leave the other one blank
B	yes
D	to fill it in
A	yeah
D	like you know not long enough for them to write
A	yeah
D	but so that they know
A	explain that they are to complete some
D	yeah
A	in the
D	mm
A	yeah
D	and then we acknowledge receipt of I would give thank you for sending
B	yeah
D	and then leave the others blank
B	leave the others yeah and you'd probably
D	and
A	yeah
D	but
B	that really
D	dates and times then
B	yes
A	you want the
D	themselves
A	dates and times left where they are?
A	did you say?
D	the vague and ambiguous words needs to be at the top cos then it gives
A	yeah yeah
D	it's highlighting to them issues
A	mm
D	about dates and times
A	yeah
D	that then they've got to put into practice themselves later
A	okay
B	mm yeah
A	yeah
D	and any different ones in
A	so that's alright then?
D	yeah
B	yes
A	and leave that one there
D	yeah I would just leave it yeah
B	well I think
A	well I can't really move that that nearer the top
B	I think that one's
D	yeah
A	yeah
D	and the other complex words leave that as at this time but then
A	leave
D	make the other one
A	blank
B	yeah
D	yeah
A	blank
D	erm
A	oh yeah a space
D	erm
A	which one?
B	yes
A	could should yeah
D	could should
B	yes
D	just leave that as an example
B	but that's a that should you that's a a good
D	yeah
B	a sentence for correction that I've done with with quite advanced students and that isn't the problem
A	mm
B	it's a completely different problem in that sentence
A	mm
B	and every single student I've ever done it with has picked that up and said that that was wrong cos they've never learnt that structure
D	yeah
A	they should
D	mm
A	yeah
B	as a
D	yeah
B	as another way of saying if
D	yeah
B	and so I've left it in because
A	yeah
B	I think advanced students should know that
D	show it
A	yeah
D	yeah yeah so I would leave that leave that whole box
B	mm
D	there but point out to them
A	because it is quite a classic
D	it's cos it is a classic but
B	yes
A	cos it's typical in formal letters and things
D	people won't think
B	yes
D	how difficult it is
A	and how should you require further information
D	yeah
A	yeah
D	cos you've said to them you know why why you know you could say to them why why might this be difficult?
A	mm
B	and again
D	because if you use if
B	with noun the noun phrases cos they
D	so I'd give take a decision
B	yeah
D	and then put a blank for the others
B	yeah
D	leave the abbreviations
B	yeah
D	cos it's just write in full
B	erm
D	leave the passives
B	leave the passive because they might not know what that is but
A	mm
D	yeah you could leave it there
B	yeah you could er I don't mean leave that I mean have it have it blank
A	leave it as that
B	you know
A	it's not a I mean I er
B	yeah
A	but I if you
B	and you don't want them to be doing too many of these
D	mm
A	no
D	yeah leave that one
B	so I'd probably that asking questions maybe just
A	knock it off
A	yeah
B	to be something that the they've got some input to
D	mm
A	mm
B	does that make sense?
D	yeah
A	yeah make last one
D	the more than one negative in a sentence you've already got asking
A	I could get rid of more than one negative
D	mm
A	cos we've already got that in the first example couldn't I?
B	well no no I think
A	oh no I'll leave it on the grid yeah
D	no it'd say it yeah
B	it's worth having it there
A	last one then
B	and just referring back yeah erm
A	have
D	put the noun phrases at the end
A	yeah
D	for example
B	yeah
A	okay
B	but I think that's
A	I'll
B	easily be able to come up with something for
A	yeah
D	mm
A	I'll put nouns
B	but there's enough
A	instead of noun phrases
B	input well
D	yeah
A	it's off-putting isn't it in phrases
D	yes it's
A	nouns that can be placed with
B	well I don't know cos they're
D	they're not gonna know what a noun or a verb is though I mean half of them
B	they are noun phrases though
A	okay yeah
B	they're not just nouns
A	yeah
D	they're not nouns so would you then with this once you've got it like that you say well we've got here are some common language pitfalls
A	yeah
D	we've got lots of examples of problem areas here we've given some
A	yeah
D	but then you're gonna have it interspersed with will you have like some of these ones where we've ticked that you're gonna give it will we just leave them in the
A	yeah
D	cos then if you did the first three say
A	yeah
D	chose some first ones where it's actually all the answers
B	yeah
A	yeah
D	there's enough of these things but
A	yeah
D	and some of it hasn't
B	hasn't yes
D	and then
A	or I could have for blank in the second one er elicit it from the so that they get the idea of filling it in and say right
B	no I think it's
A	in no?
B	no I don't think it's a a
D	no I don't think you need to no
B	it's not a difficult concept
D	no
A	two first three together okay er
D	yeah
A	so do first three
D	yeah do first three and then something about
A	the other and then hand over
B	then say right
D	yeah have a look through these other ones and intersperse it with ones where like the one that's abbreviations where it was already answered or the could and should
A	yeah
D	where it's already answered
A	yeah
D	and leave that in just in the middle as it is now
A	yes
B	yes
A	oh yeah
D	so they can read them so you don't need to go through it
A	yeah
D	as you introduce them
B	yes yes
A	yeah
D	because they can just read them
B	so that there's not too much of you
A	that's some
B	just reading out what's in front of
A	some have answers and some you have to do some work for
D	yeah
A	yeah
D	yeah and then as you go through it all with the answers then and explain why and what's difficult about it
A	yeah
D	then you when you get to this point you can say well
B	yeah yeah
D	and ask them if you know if they realise so you could just cover the ones that you've given the answers to like the passives and things as you're going through and then the gap
B	yeah
D	but no I think it's good and
B	yes yeah
D	I think it will take you forty-five minutes
A	yes I do I do now that we've put a bit of work into it
D	yeah
A	and also it's
D	and then
A	yeah more attractive
B	and it fits very nicely onto four sides
D	yeah and then identify the possible problems
D	well as long as you're
A	it'll be on behind the back it'll be on the back won't it?
B	yes yeah that is
D	yes that'll be on the back yeah
A	that's
B	erm that's what I mean I mean I think that I I wasn't just being sarcastic there
A	oh
B	I mean I actually think it
A	yeah
B	it's good if it does you don't want something that's going on for pages and pages
A	no no
B	but it's got to be solid at the same time
A	right I haven't read through these again and erm so I haven't changed them I've just literally
D	mm
A	put the squares round them to and I attempted to put them into an e-box format but I think they're better with the squares round them anyway
B	mm
A	because it separates them a bit then
D	I think even if we can't actually I think this is quite a good way to make it look an e
A	yeah
D	email actually
B	yeah
D	that that's probably near enough on the other one
A	yeah
D	actually
B	perhaps
D	are you gonna
B	I'll I'll play about with that yes
D	but you could just
B	I'm interested to see what I can achieve there now that's the trouble
A	I think I'll get rid of practice it's too schooly I'll just put look at the emails there and identify possible problems
D	mm yeah
A	as an instruction
D	yeah
D	and what so if we just look through them what are the problems? I'm just gonna nip to the loo but maybe we could just
A	I don't
D	talk through what the problems are so we're clear
A	well this is the timing and dating thing isn't it?
B	yes
A	it's not clear
B	yes and
A	you know and the date is not clear and the
B	and you do need
A	mm
B	they're actually probably less likely to be sure which time you cos either could be possible
A	yeah
B	erm I mean I've my friend in Germany always when we're arranging to Skype always says BST
A	yeah
B	with the time
A	yeah
B	so that we're well I'm sure
B	and that's not business but he is a business person you know
A	yeah
B	he's not an English teacher
A	I think the phrase please let me know if you have an availability is quite it's not an easy phrase for
B	and with the following week I would then perhaps
A	yeah that's that's rubbish isn't it?
B	well no then put in
A	the week beginning the twenty-fourth or whatever yeah
B	well I mean you could say the following week but you also
A	the next week
B	then in brackets need to put ie week commencing whatever or ie
A	a different time yeah a different instead of alternative times a different time erm in the week
B	well can't you just put dates in brackets?
A	yeah
B	cos you
D	yeah
B	I mean week commencing is a bit long isn't it?
A	yeah yeah so dates
B	and and people would be likely to put W stroke C if you did that
D	yeah
B	and and
A	yeah
B	why would anybody understand that abbreviation?
D	mm
A	that's right yeah so basically the first one is a fairly simple one about it's not clear what time they want me to meet
B	yes so there's not there's not a huge problem it's just that
A	no and then the language could be simplified into you know er
D	yeah
A	with the dates okay
B	mm yes
D	yeah
A	and the availability right the second one
B	yes I mean
A	yeah
B	suggestions
A	mm
D	mm
B	yes
D	yeah very good
B	so are you free is clearer isn't it?
D	yeah
B	er the next one
D	well the first sentence
B	well I mean I think actually if you read that
B	and you might actually be sitting there thinking I'm not a hundred percent sure what's been decided
D	mm
A	yeah
B	yes no
A	what the you know it needs to be a clearer headline for a start
B	things like
A	or about what the decision really
B	have have we had obviously that's a
D	well the headline I don't think
B	well
D	I don't think I'd put the answer in a headline
B	no
A	I would because otherwise they they read they might be reading it waiting for good news and then they find out it's bad whereas it's better to make it clear right from
B	well I think that's something to ask of
D	well what would you put in there what would you put then?
A	erm
D	gosh I'd never put that in a million years
A	wouldn't you?
B	no I don't know that I would either
D	in a million years I'd never put that in a subject
A	wouldn't you? you think it's too brutal?
D	if I had to break bad news to somebody
B	no
D	I just think that is just
B	I think maybe that's a question have you
D	yeah
B	if you if you think you would maybe that's a question to ask the audience
D	ask them whether they would
A	yeah
D	yeah
B	what they would because
D	yeah
B	cos I don't think I think I think that's adequate
A	I hate it though when I read an email and I think it's one thing and then you come to it at the end of it and you find it's something completely
D	but they're not saying it's a good thing or a bad thing
A	no
D	they're just saying that it's about the project
B	yes
A	yeah it's been cancelled
D	well yeah but the
D	but they're not saying it has or it hasn't been cancelled they're just saying the topic of the thing is about the project
A	okay that makes
B	yeah
D	so at
A	okay
B	and the first sentence well no the second sentence tells you that it's
D	yeah
B	been cancelled so it's just
D	yeah had we had is another of these should we have
B	yeah should you wish and all this er yes so erm
A	please don't hesitate to contact me
B	being polite but actually that's
A	please contact me yeah
D	yeah
B	yes
A	it's just a more pleasant isn't it?
D	and if you wish to discuss the matter is also might make people think that actually you're not saying no
A	yeah
D	because
B	yes yes
D	and and so
A	so not clear what the real not clear what the message is really is it?
D	well I think it is clear that the message is the message is the project's not viable
A	yeah
D	it's just that people often will
A	to a native speaker it is
D	yeah
A	but erm to a non-native
D	I think it's just a long-winded way to saying it
A	yeah a long long-winded
D	and we're looking at language aren't we?
A	okay too long-winded
D	yeah
A	and their their job is to simply that's
D	yeah
B	yeah I mean those those first two sentences
A	do you think it's a bit similar to doing this though?
B	should be run together shouldn't they as I'm sorry but
D	but here they don't have to simplify it you're asking them to identify problems not simplify it
B	mm yes
A	oh yeah
B	actually that is true
A	and
B	they're not rewriting are they?
A	yes okay and that would be good
D	otherwise they're doing the same as the last exercise
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	so that would be good for timing as well
D	so what's the problem with it?
A	the problem is just
D	the problem the first sentence
A	it's just far too wordy
D	it's wordy it's wordy that's the problem with it
A	yeah
B	mm
A	too wordy too long-winded
D	too wordy it's to they've got pick out
A	yeah erm
B	and it's got some quite complex structures in so
D	and it's got some of these examples of structures yeah
A	complex structures
D	yeah
A	that we've
B	yeah
A	told them not to use
D	complex sentences
A	structures
D	structures doesn't mean anything to a non-linguistic
A	yes oh okay sentences I'll I'll refer them back to some of the things
D	yeah
A	in here yeah
B	or just say quite complex language
D	yeah
A	complex language yeah
D	mm
A	language and
B	I mean even things like that but trust with the ellipsis
A	mm
B	of the I
D	mm
D	mm
B	to a to a lot of foreigners it's
D	less trust?
B	but trust it's not clear that could be
A	could trust yeah
D	right
A	yeah
D	yeah
A	yeah
B	do you know what I mean?
A	yeah yeah
D	yeah I wouldn't do three actually I think just two is enough for the
A	yeah
D	by the time you've done
A	I
D	that exercise
A	I agree
D	oh in case
B	yes
A	that was in case activity
D	yeah
A	but I think you're right
B	so
A	we will only get
B	I think
A	up to two
D	yeah
B	well we you'd be looking at the timing there wouldn't you?
D	yeah
D	yeah
B	and seeing and if you have
D	we'll see but you're right yeah
B	belted through it then we've got a third one in reserve
D	we've got one haven't we?
A	yes and also
B	otherwise say well we didn't say
A	yeah
B	you were really fast but but
A	yeah
B	we didn't really expect to get through three or something
A	and in
D	yeah
A	and in case anyone's had time to read it the main problem of the third one is boom
D	er yeah
A	which I can't remember what it is but
D	it's er it's already done
A	erm
B	mm
A	in clearer language
D	mm
A	so it's clarity of questions really
D	mm
A	you know and it's just all mixed up in the
B	yeah
D	yeah
B	yeah
A	so
D	yeah
A	writing it's it's it's the format as much as anything yeah
B	mm
A	this one erm
D	yeah
B	have you ever actually sent us your PowerPoint
D	I've got it copied here
B	but
D	oh I thought I had but but I might not have done
B	I don't think you have done
D	if you haven't got it then you haven't got it no well I'll do it now so
A	yeah
D	yeah erm right very good
A	and then I'm gonna hand over to my colleague are we having a break or?
D	no there's no break
A	no oh there's no break so who is going to take you through or talk to you about
D	this
A	yeah
D	for emails and written language
A	yeah
D	now we're gonna look at spoken language
B	you've been very extravagant with the colour printing
D	uh-huh well because if
B	no I mean yes
D	cos
B	we do yes
A	two
B	oh dear I need my flipping reading glasses
D	oh
A	yeah
D	shouldn't I and not really mention emails here
A	no because I didn't mention
D	yeah yeah
A	or so cos they'll say what the hell is that?
D	erm so this is a summary of it all this second slide er the tips for effective communication so I was just gonna er when I've done this before I'd just leave that there say this is the summary think about and as you're going through just remember this picture and I'll come back to it at the end and it's just er getting them thinking about it as they go through and then we look at the different variety what different varieties of English are there?
B	mm
D	and so obviously there's all these different ones on the left and then within Britain there's all these different ones and others so the question is whose English should we be using when doing business internationally? and then people have all different views on that should you use oh
B	mm
D	not get rid of
B	no
D	and so what's your view on that? but not dialects so I wouldn't say I'm going down the
B	mm
D	in erm Geordie or something
B	yeah
D	but that people will speak with accents and
A	yeah it's part of the
D	mm mm yeah
A	skill of being an international communicator
B	well I mean apart from everything else
A	so you've got to be tolerant of different
B	if you try not to you end up producing very weird results
D	mm
B	you know like you've ever heard anybody from Yorkshire trying to speak RP
D	mm
B	you'd be very often coming a the the hyper-correcting and saying
D	which just sounds really odd
B	yes which just sounds ridiculous
A	mm
D	so we ask them what they think about that and then apart from the accent what other difficulties might colleagues have internationally with understanding native speakers when they speak English?
A	what does that say on here?
D	that says one minute cos that's er
A	oh
D	it's an egg timer
A	oh
D	so actually when you've got it on the screen it goes when I click it goes down so they've got a minute to think about that
A	oh I see
D	so just have a think about it
B	right
A	that's clever
D	er and then these are some of them so individual sounds the way that sounds get put together in the
B	mm
D	and then I just go through them all a little bit so these are the individual sounds and don't worry I'm not gonna go through all of these different sounds here in this picture er and I look at long and short sounds a little bit like shot and short or chip and cheap and how people can't always get that and then er and consonant clusters like comfortable and then individual words and up comes the word look and I say you know what difficulty might people have with a word that's a simple as look? and then people will say oh well it's the same word the pronunciation of it
A	mm
D	some people that would make a problem
B	well you do if you're from Lancashire
D	in some places or they might say
A	mm
B	right
D	so they'll think about that er and then I say yeah what about the word that comes after luck? and how look at look after look for it's a totally different word in most other languages look at is a totally different idea to look for so they've got to listen carefully to what comes after
B	mm
D	so even a simple word can seem difficult
A	mm
D	but then when you started putting it when you start putting speech
B	mm
D	so it's just knowing you know you might the last one the words are not difficult but sometimes when you're listening to a foreign language
A	it's not just it's
D	it's hard to know where one word ends and the next word begins
A	so what's the advice or does that come
D	the advice comes later
A	I mean would you not give them like how can you avoid you know creating that problem for people?
D	I don't think I think if I start giving them tips and going back and forwards
A	yeah
B	mm
D	it just becomes
A	okay
D	very
A	yeah
D	bitty
A	yeah
D	I think it's
A	okay
D	say what the issue make them aware of the issues and then look at things
A	mm
B	mm
D	and then and look at sometimes I don't do this one but which one do you actually hear?
B	mm
A	right
A	yeah
D	in certain context
A	mm
D	er and so then to practice that a bit more about when
A	where d'you live
D	and the third one's very difficult of course and then ain't it hot isn't it hot and people like say ain't it hot in 'ere or isn't it hot
B	yeah mm
D	and and to think you know people we all say this kind of thing well you know not necessarily all of these but people say this kind of thing all the time
B	mm
D	and it's really difficult for people to pick up on it sometimes er and then culturally specific or specialist vocabularies so abbreviations and I don't need to say a lot about this cos this has already been touched upon elsewhere
B	mm
D	but the specialist vocabulary people might know about but and then there's four examples here how might you say them and just like to jot down the number I give them a ring or shall I run through that again
B	mm
D	so a phrasal verb is not that I use that word or using abbreviations like CEO or let's get down to the nitty-gritty which we it came up before
A	I put that on cos you gave it to me
D	yeah
B	yeah
D	that's good
A	but if you want I can change it
B	no no that's fine
D	yeah
A	yeah
D	and people speak either with a very monotone fast or too
A	mm
D	or famous people and people that are well known in one culture are not necessarily well known in another one
A	yeah
D	and people that you just assume everybody knows are not always known so David Beckham might be quite well known in Japan
B	mm
D	but other people that we know really well like off the Friends television programme or from the X Factor or that some of these famous people singers people don't know sometimes it's based on some culturally specific things they're just
B	mm
D	the student that the person's time that you're talking to
B	yes
A	yeah
B	you need to know how old people are
D	yeah and so erm or it's based got sometimes you can you end up talking about things which are very based on life here and it's not erm people just don't get it cos it's
B	well I have a problem with when I'm watching comedy shows on
D	mm
B	because
D	mm yeah no I have that problem
B	and I actually gradually deduced who some of these people are from the jokes that are made about them but I don't actually know
D	yeah and so it's you know there's
B	mm
D	and aren't known in other cultures so what vocabulary do you have and a match I was gonna a bit of that but there might not be time and then the tips for effective communication are here in a list and I
B	mm
D	but er and we just talk about them all
A	yeah it's good
B	yeah
D	it's what I've done in the past and
A	what's that that one sorry what was the suggestion?
D	oh that's just here are some suggestions
A	oh I see yeah
D	and then just go onto it
B	yeah
D	so it's quick and then I bring up those original pictures again with the blanks here and really what I'm doing is I'm testing them on what I just said on the slide before which is a bit vocabulary it's word dense
B	mm
D	so really I'm just testing them on the same things again
B	yeah
D	so I say what do you think then this picture? and they don't have to get the right answer it doesn't matter it just makes them think
B	yeah
D	it makes them activates gonna ask you about what we've just said doesn't it?
B	yeah
A	what is it?
D	so the first one
A	a dolphin?
D	a dolphin
A	a shark oh okay
D	with his mouth open
A	okay
D	doesn't really matter what the
A	mm
D	er use frequently used vocabulary like chair instead of you know and so call the spade a spade in effect er have regular breaks in meetings because and a cup of tea or coffee have breaks cos it's very difficult to work in a foreign language all the time
A	mm
D	but also
B	it's it's exhausting
A	mm
D	the cup of tea also represents erm cultural references that we we tend we might have a tea break or
A	mm
D	and where coffee's always written in Italian these days but people have a a tea break but in other cultures people don't stop for tea breaks
A	mm
D	you know er and then
A	mm
B	yeah
D	erm get it both
B	yeah
D	and then names numbers dates and places always write them out names and places that seem really obvious to us
A	yeah
D	cos everybody knows Worcester
A	mm
D	you can't expect people to know er to know what that Wor-ces-ter is actually Worcester
B	mm
D	or that er
B	yes
D	even names like really common names like James other people might not know that or surnames that people know that are really common in the UK
A	yeah
D	they're not necessarily
A	mm
D	so write things out and then the questions and I haven't put your erm thing on here from
B	no
D	but I will do or
B	well yes I mean I've struggled with that
D	yeah mm
B	on the on the receiving end of people students telling me what their name was and saying the whole name and I don't know
A	yeah
B	and they don't seem to to realise that it's a name and therefore it's unfamiliar
A	yeah
D	mm
B	but it's important so you've got to be clear
D	that student did this morning that was upset and she said my name is
B	yeah
D	god I just missed that altogether
D	cos it wasn't a name I'd heard of before
B	yes exactly
D	but I need to put your name on the bottom
A	mm
D	I'd put us two actually because we were running this afternoon I suppose
A	yeah yeah but but it's the last though isn't it?
D	but it's the last slide so
A	oh yeah
D	I put all of us on erm
A	comments and questions? how long will are you going to allow for that? or
D	oh it depends how much time there is
A	yeah
B	yes
D	and whether there's any comments or questions
B	yeah and how keen they are on running off for the lunch
D	oh what oh if people wanna get out yeah
D	so
B	yeah
D	I mean
A	no because you've done it lots of time and you
D	mm
A	I've just moved that over a little bit to there so it's in the middle
D	oh yeah
A	mm
D	oh you did yeah no it's alright it's alright
A	but it's very good I think it's
D	mm
A	you know it's a nice finish it's not
D	erm
A	too demanding for them they can just
B	yeah
A	have some fun trying out some of this
D	and so at the end of that we're saying well what we've looked at today
A	mm
D	then I've got to summarise the whole day haven't I
A	yeah
D	cos I'll
A	yes
D	just be finishing then
B	are you gonna actually put up a slide there or are you just gonna talk?
D	no I'm just gonna say so what we've done because I think by now they'll know what we've done
B	yeah
D	so what we've done today what we looked at today is erm business communication in international international business communication in emails and spoken language meeting well written and spoken communication
B	yeah
A	yeah
D	and spoken and culture and language there you go
B	and maybe
D	and we've got the tips cos the tips are actually
B	so maybe reiterative that bit that although we've given you quite a lot of specific tips it does still as we've as we've said
D	mm
B	er boil down to more than anything just being aware of possible issues and and adapting yourself to individual situations
A	yeah
D	mm
B	yes
D	so those
B	so
D	I'll contact
B	you feed us back about the results
D	yes I'll let you know about that erm
B	erm
D	I thought when we print out the handouts and we need to do that when we know how many people are coming or have booked on it and
B	yes
D	so if you keep working on yours and that
B	yes
A	and you know
B	yes
D	we get it ready so that I've got them all there we can then print them I would print them out on hundred gram paper cos it just looks nicer
B	yes
D	and I've got some of that already
B	right
D	so I could print that off for us
A	yeah
D	if I've got the final version of everything
A	mm
B	yeah
D	erm
A	I'll do it as soon as I can cos er
D	erm and erm
A	send it off tomorrow
D	so I need to ask
A	I like that
D	it's like a little quiz
A	it's really good
D	I don't know whether you've seen it
A	I did I did
D	but it's good
A	it's very good cos it goes back to a lot of the the issues that have come up so
D	yeah and erm where would where would be put it though?
A	on your
D	on my handout
A	country one the one about the country couldn't it go there?
D	on here?
A	that one yeah
D	what is your cultural profile?
A	mm
D	yeah cos we're either putting it on there or on effective email
B	no
D	so it's that one on it
A	does that one need to be you know
B	so
A	can nothing go on the back of that just to reduce the paper? do you know what I mean?
B	well there is
A	well I know but we've already got those in in the thing I just wondered if
B	well
A	so that we're gonna have so many handouts
B	if you made those a little bit smaller you could put that link on the back couldn't you? but no I don't think
A	mm
B	I
A	are part of the talk
B	er or most of the other are most of the other handouts two sides or are they all one side?
D	I was actually gonna ask you whether we should be using double sided or not
A	oh definitely definitely
B	yeah
D	mm
A	yeah because you know we don't want to waste paper on it
D	mm yeah
A	and er as
D	mm
A	and nobody likes going away with loads and loads of paper
D	loads of yeah loads of paper yeah
A	they're more likely to bin it I think well if you think it looks nicer on single sided
D	I think in a folder it can you can see but it doesn't matter I'd only
B	well
D	I'm not feeling strongly about it
A	oh well it yeah
D	well wait I think your handouts we'd certainly have it on double
A	yeah
B	yeah
D	I think we will just use double sided won't we?
A	oh think so
D	yeah erm
B	well I mean that one is only single sided
D	yeah
B	and I think that's fair enough
D	that would be
A	why couldn't that go on the back of that one? there was
B	well no cos I think that looks a bit cheap
D	cos cos it looks cheap if you
A	does it?
D	cos it's not the same exercise at all
A	no
B	no no
D	you know it's not
A	well it's not an exercise it's just a
D	but when people look at that it won't even be connected to this
A	okay
D	they'll turn over and it's not even the same nobody's even gonna mention that for like half an hour
A	okay
B	yeah
D	so I certainly don't think we should have double
B	no no
D	this is where it's probably why I was asking it really cos
A	no okay
D	a few pieces of paper
B	but I think
D	you know it's
B	the way we've got them like that I mean that and then as you say you put that on the back but if you if you
D	that I'll put the culture profile
B	if you could put that link goes on on that somewhere
D	yeah
B	yes erm
D	yeah
B	erm
A	is there gonna be erm an you know an e an email version for them so that they can click directly on that link? cos that's how most people like to access all their stuff now
D	is it?
A	mm
D	it's how most people have to access their stuff now
A	yeah most
D	whether that's how they want to is another matter
A	yeah
B	well cos they we don't like it maybe
D	business people and younger people are not the same thing
A	no I know
B	we don't all
A	that's the
D	it is but
B	well
D	but every session we've been to with
A	I'm not saying we shouldn't hand it out
B	yes
D	isn't it? and
A	I'm just saying they should have the people who want to should be able to click somewhere and get it you know online rather
B	well do we have any means of giving them something
D	well if there is a way
D	ask us to send it cos she'll say send it to us
A	yeah I think they should it just looks more up to date you know to have it available at least
D	oh yeah we can have it available yeah
B	yeah
D	and she'll probably ask us for it later I would think
A	mm
D	cos she'll probably want to but I don't know whether she sends it I don't I don't know I think what happens actually in the last one I went to I got it
A	yeah
D	we said can you send us the slides so then you know and we said oh yes okay then
A	mm
D	so I think if people ask us for them we will we can do but erm
A	yeah
D	I know what you mean about printing things out and I mean but I know that my students for example I don't on working with languages
A	we're not allowed to we're not allowed to print out at
D	it's all just on
A	yeah
D	and this kind of thing now but and I don't print it out for for working with languages now but erm
A	do they?
D	yeah
A	mm
D	cos they don't read it
B	well
A	well they don't read it anyway
D	they can't get they can't have access to it cos even though they've all got mobile devices that are smartphones
A	mm
D	you don't wanna read a module handbook on your smartphone
B	no
A	but they don't read it anyway
D	well that's what
A	but at least they can refer to it you know
D	but they can't refer to it in the same way
B	if they can't refer to it quickly
D	if it's stuck on the virtual learning environment
B	yeah
A	mm
D	and so so like even like the PowerPoint slides you know the students they've had to get used to now but they don't actually like I don't think do you think your students like going on there and having
A	I do I do
D	it costs them a fortune to print it
A	I think they prefer it they don't they get annoyed and lots of them have told me not that's partly why I'm a bit sensitive to it
D	don't print
A	yeah
B	right
A	they've said there's too much paper
D	oh
B	well I think
A	yeah
D	mm
A	yeah
B	I think you know yeah I mean in class I would say to the students you know I've I I would double side a worksheet two different worksheets
A	mm
B	from the same
D	oh yeah
A	mm
B	but I do think a business environment is a bit different
A	mm
B	and so
D	yeah
B	I think that
A	no no no okay
D	no but I do think that this one
B	but it think
D	should be
B	should be double sided
A	yeah
D	yeah
B	yeah
D	and I think this one should be doubled sided
A	yeah
D	cos it's one handout
B	yes
A	yeah
B	yes if it's
D	yeah
A	yeah
B	that's why I was saying it's good that it's four sides
A	yeah
D	yeah
B	rather than a
A	mm
B	an odd number
A	yeah
B	because it it works out quite
D	and actually on this one I did kind of put something on the back cos I thought well if I'm gonna handout one side I might as well put something
B	yes
D	on the back of it that that you're not
A	yeah
D	but not for the agree disagree because it's at a different time of the meeting
B	yeah yeah
D	but I will add this this
B	link
D	onto the back of it
B	yeah
A	mm
B	okay
D	and we can tell them about it
A	yeah
D	erm what else have I got in here?
A	oh
D	so we're nearly there aren't we?
A	yeah
D	erm we need to think about in what we're gonna do if we'll keep working on our bits and then maybe
B	mm
D	have one more meeting but and about payment for you
A	yes
D	so are you adding up some
A	well
D	you know you need to think about time and how much
A	I haven't been adding it up but
D	no
A	but I mean
B	mm
D	well you need to
A	yeah
D	cos we can't do that because we don't get paid extra for it anyway
A	you don't get paid extra anyway well I don't know you must have had an idea of from whatever you get I I can try and add it up like
D	I have no concept
A	I mean but the thing is it's not a sudden all in one block like today for example I went into work at whatever time ten or something
D	mm
A	and then I did a lot of other stuff and then I started properly about twelve
D	yeah well you need to think about
A	twelve one two three
D	how much money you want paying for it
A	you know
D	how many hours
B	well I mean the each of the meetings that we've
A	and some of the other ones I've spent longer on yeah
B	have been about two hours I mean
A	yeah they have yeah
B	you see you know erm
A	so how many meetings have we had? three?
D	three?
A	three
D	so that's six hours
A	yeah
B	but then obviously the time that you've spent on your own
A	yes
D	you have to work out for yourself
A	okay
D	yeah so have a think about it
A	I will yeah
D	but you know it might be
A	yeah
D	we need to check with
A	yeah
D	right? well then you either claim it as at the meeting rate
A	mm
D	fourteen hours at the meeting rate cos the meeting rate is a sixty minute hour isn't it?
B	mm
A	yeah
D	so er fourteen hours at the meeting rate or you claim it at you claim something like seven hours at the teaching rate
A	yeah
D	something cos you claim half as many cos it's for every hour that for teaching you're getting paid for preparing and marking as well
A	yeah
D	so you're kind of getting another hour on top of it
B	right yeah yeah
D	so so it's something like you either claim fourteen hours at the meeting rate or half as many hours I think it is
A	yeah
D	at the teaching rate and one of those works out slightly better for you
A	okay
B	so do the maths and
D	but
A	yeah
A	yeah
D	so she like
B	yeah
D	lots of project stuff so she'll know
A	I'll ask
D	but what you'll need to know before you ask
A	yeah okay
D	and it would be useful if you told us that cos then if she said to me or
A	ah
B	yes
A	okay
D	cos if she says to us make us guess
A	but I haven't been writing it down because
D	mm
A	you get involved in it don't you and you start reading up on stuff
B	well I mean our answer to that is we know how long we've spent in meetings but we don't know how long she's taken on on working the
D	yeah on the rest of it
A	no
B	the work why should we?
D	but she she might ask us what do we think is reasonable and it would be handy for us to know
A	mm
D	what you've thought about before
A	yes
D	before we get
B	yeah
D	asked that question
A	okay
D	just so we all
A	well for each meeting but I mean no I can't I can't work it out I mean I'll think about it
D	you can't so think about it
A	no because you know
D	yeah
A	and trying to find links and and I've been doing that but I I certainly didn't time it
D	yeah
A	I should have done really but
B	yeah
A	you know
D	see I time
B	mm
D	I write down every like I look at the seven o'clock to eight o'clock seven o'clock to
A	do you?
D	every single time yeah cos I'm getting paid by the number of hours I've done
A	I would do I would do again
D	yeah
A	I would do again if as you did it but I was I was more to start with interested in the project you know
B	yes
D	yeah
A	and then when it comes to doing the work obviously you would like to get paid for it
D	you don't
A	but I was actually interested in doing
D	yeah
A	it just seemed and interesting thing to
D	you need to get the
B	mm
A	obviously I want to get paid
D	yeah and I don't know whether
A	yeah
D	well you can't have that anyway but
A	mm
D	erm it's something I dunno where what she's got in her head about and actually it's getting paid for out of the
A	yeah
D	so it's just erm
A	yeah
D	but erm yeah
A	I mean I'll try and calculate
D	but work work the first thing is to work out
A	yeah this weekend I'll
D	we can work out how you claim for it afterwards
A	yeah
D	when you've worked out
A	okay
D	erm yeah when you've worked out how many hours you think you've put into it
A	mm
D	which we're not mm finished yet have we?
A	no
B	no
D	and then the day that we deliver it assuming that we are gonna be delivering it and then
D	and then the erm
B	that would be quite funny actually if we didn't
D	well then we'd have to think about a
A	yes
B	yes
A	yes definitely yes
B	yeah
D	and
B	can I go home now
D	yeah
A	yeah
B	I want my tea
A	what time is it? six is it?
D	I bet you're starving aren't you cos you came with your with the wrong food for today
