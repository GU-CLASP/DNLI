E	mm
A	that
C	it is isn't it? Look Reserve Rioja on a special offer in the Co-op
A	nice
C	oh isn't that nice the?
A	it's very nice
C	um
E	yeah we're all getting poisoned tomorrow cos dad's too proud to use someone else's fridge
A	his fridge keeps freezing things and we're not going to get poisoned
C	when will you find someone and get them to mend it?
E	he did
A	he did he called them
E	and he said it would be like two hundred two hundred and fifty quid
C	no
A	yeah
E	yeah it would be cheaper to buy another one
A	because of that because of that the part in that machine he'd have to come out and his his hourly rate is fifty quid and he'd have to come out twice
C	well I'm sure you could find somebody else
E	no
A	well he he found him because he's an expert
E	yeah and it's
A	so he was going to try and fix himself but then he thinks he might just have to buy a new one cos they're you know like a hundred and eighty quid aren't they?
C	no that one was a lot of money
E	it was two hundred quid
A	yeah I wouldn't mind
E	for one night and he was like no no no I don't want to do that
B	how good is this wine?
A	I love it
B	we watched
A	sorry
C	he's hopeless
A	I was just going to say if he just gets the chicken out in the morning it would defrost by lunchtime so it won't be a problem
A	so it's just it's better that it freezes rather than not keeps cool that's the better way around
C	but it is quite cool so what's wrong with
A	yeah so it's not a problem
C	and he doesn't have a cat to worry about
A	thank God if both of you had cats it would never get out
B	you wouldn't even have to worry about Oscar if there was chicken lying around he only likes Go Cat
E	it's not going to eat a raw chicken
C	mind you that's true
B	he only eats Go Cat
C	that's true he doesn't like meat
A	he is a very fussy cat
B	because he doesn't even like tuna when you put it down
A	no
C	that's true he doesn't
B	it's really nice
A	delicious
C	Good
B	yeah
A	that's what this always reminds me of
B	I know
C	and then I started singing it didn't I when it was on?
B	mm yeah and you quite liked it didn't you?
C	I did quite like it
A	my colleague
C	it's not
A	what's the word?
C	contemporary
A	no
C	anachronistic?
A	yeah
B	what?
C	anachronistic it's there's not
B	no I know but what does he mean?
A	like he has
B	mm
C	but the rest of it was probably spot on I think
A	there or thereabouts but there was some stuff that was going to be released later just because Richard Curtis really liked it and he included it so
C	oh right okay
A	which is for for people like us who don't apart from David Bowie eighties Bowie that you know doesn't belong there
C	absolutely
A	generally unless you're a dad you're not going to know
B	but that song was only used like when the credits came on it wasn't they weren't playing it or anything
C	no I know but
A	no but it's still in the film
C	why use it at all you know?
A	mm
C	not a good enough reason really
B	it's a pretty good song
A	that's an excellent song
C	try some of the aubergine it's just soft and it's not mushy it's just soft
A	Don't be silly mutty
B	it's really nice
C	it is really nice
B	and how was
A	mm really good
B	oh was it?
A	mm
B	mm
A	so we had a bit of a drive around and um it was easy enough to park at the bottom of
B	yeah
A	and um walk up so we did that and just sat there and watched the rain go past and then went for dinner down at the waterfront so the Wetherspoons because it's cheap
B	mm mm
A	and I was trying to think of places that we could drive to and not have to walk around in the rain
A	yeah it used to be called
C	really?
A	yeah
C	oh
A	illegal then they've changed that
B	loads of Wetherspoons still have that sign saying
A	mm
B	yeah
A	yes yeah so that was good
C	was that good?
A	yeah it was good and it got to the point where I thought I can't see the exit I'm in the middle of the dance floor and what's what happens if I can't get out?
B	yeah
A	but it was fine and I just concentrated on it
B	yeah
A	mm
C	oh dear
A	right at the end
E	they were that bad?
A	yeah
A	she felt suicidal
E	and made everyone pass out
B	no she said it was just so hot and
C	yeah
B	I think she couldn't see a way to get out and then she was just like dad I don't feel very well and went down on the ground
A	it was so hot in there
A	mm
C	oh dear
A	but it gets so hot in there even before she'd come on it was boiling
B	yeah I remember
A	but it was good I was hoping for student prices but no
C	no?
B	oh really?
C	they put all the prices up?
A	when they open up to the public yeah
B	you should have been drinking a and it's only one pound fifty
A	mm
B	mm
C	it's just as well then isn't it?
A	well I had a shandy pint of and a
C	mm
C	do you like your mug?
E	sorry?
C	do you like your mug?
E	yeah I thought you called me a mug
C	yeah
B	we were going to go on an Easter egg trail at the National Trust
C	are you?
A	mm
B	I would assume so
A	mm
B	I have another mug I have two mugs
C	nice
B	that's true
C	and you lost all yours
B	I think I smashed it in
C	actually I had no intention of getting Whittard mugs I went I was going to go to the Disney shop
A	it's closed or it's moved hasn't it? Or has it just closed?
C	I was going to go there because you were complaining that you missed your green mug that
B	mm
C	bought you
B	yeah correct
C	so I thought I know I'll get some mugs and fill them with chocolate eggs that's much nicer than just a big chocolate egg
B	mm I bet they were like
C	went to the Disney shop no it's closed
B	mum
A	I thought I don't know if it's moved or if it has closed
C	and I had no idea it had
A	um what green mug?
C	so I was kind of stuck
B	it had a Winnie the Pooh on it but it's not because it had a Winnie the Pooh on it that I missed it I missed it because it was massive
C	yeah
B	and I could have like a pint of tea if wanted it
A	mm
B	you know how sometimes you just need a massive mug of tea?
A	oh yeah I remember
B	it was huge
A	mm
B	I don't know
C	so I couldn't do it
A	I think they've taken it to
B	because if I'd seen it in the cupboard at uni I would have taken it home so I think someone pilfered it
A	mm
C	oh dear
A	it probably got broken and you didn't realise until you moved
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	mm
C	well that's the
B	so many of my things have been broken
C	so that was the plan but it didn't work out so I got these instead
A	oh no I prefer this it looks nice thank you
C	oh good
B	yeah it's lovely thank you
A	you'll probably find one of those cups in a charity shop
B	just a giant mug yeah
C	you often do
B	that is my only specification
C	it has to be giant
B	yeah
C	so does chocolate go with beer?
E	anything goes with beer
C	would you like another potato and some carrots? Go on
E	no I can't eat salad and
C	okay well you should have had this
E	no I'm fine
C	who wants the last potato
A	you have it you've got it in your hands
B	how many times have we told her to eat that last potato?
C	I don't feel terribly hungry and I was looking forward to all the nice flavours
A	mm that's really nice
E	mm
A	are you enjoying your leeks?
C	they're really nice
B	very nice and especially in the tomato thing
C	mm
A	very healthy
C	well it's got a lot of olive oil in it but that's okay
A	that's a good fat it breaks down the bad fat
C	it is
B	olives don't have that many calories in them either
C	yeah
A	no they're just good for you
B	I always thought they did
A	they need to have the olive oil
B	I love olives
C	so what
C	try again
B	you go
C	no you go
B	no you go
C	we did think about having a um a Harry Potter session didn't we?
A	mm
B	we can still do that
C	um
E	well it's better than the things you usually
C	okay well I can't think of anything else that all four of us might actually like
B	yeah I think we should watch it
A	yeah
C	we better start soon
B	no they're only about two
A	days
B	hours I think one of them might be a bit longer
C	ah it's nearly half past seven
B	um I watched the first episode of the Walking Dead the other day
A	it's good isn't it?
E	awesome
B	it is good but um
E	they've done the whole second season as well
B	you found it really funny and you were like it's like Shaun Of The Dead
C	it really looked like Shaun Of The Dead
B	the zombies are Shaun Of The Dead
C	and it looked so
E	it's so good
B	yeah I'm going to it's because they're showing it on um Five Star
E	yeah yeah
B	so from the beginning so I'm going to watch that on there
E	there's a second season as well
B	oh is it?
E	yeah
E	they they come up on the internet
B	yeah I want I quite like watching things on TV
E	it's a sort of thing that it all ends badly over and over again
B	I'm sure it will because it's about zombies
E	mm
C	it just looked you know really cheesy
C	like like Shaun Of The Dead it just reminded me of it
C	they're they're actually doing this you know they're actually walking like this
E	because he's he was in the wasn't he the guy?
B	Andrew Lincoln yeah
A	mm
B	but we were saying the other day how so many British actors are now going over to American series
E	because they get paid
B	yeah I'm sure they do but seriously
C	but they're actually good and they can do the accents quite well
A	yeah they're better well I probably would give credit to the voice coaches as opposed to the actors
C	oh maybe mm
A	mm
C	and they can just do it easily
A	yeah
C	was that alright would you like some more? Sorry I should have done more potatoes than that I thought there were plenty
A	er no not when it comes to potatoes
C	well I do apologise
A	that's fine
C	mm yeah and getting full up although it is very good
E	you should watch Alcatraz as well
B	no
E	that's why we I got I got to the end of it last night
B	I've also watched a couple of episodes of Lost I'm just trying it out
E	four
C	have you watched Four?
A	I'm impressed that you got that mum actually watched it and I never thought she would
B	yeah
E	you need to get to meet
B	just give it six series
C	hah I'm not sure I'm going to make six series to be honest
A	there's only twenty-four episodes in each series
C	oh is that all
E	less than that
B	no not in series three there's only like thirteen or four
E	no four from four onwards there's not that many
B	the episodes are really short though I think they seem
E	forty minutes
B	and now that I'm used to the the longer episodes of HBO series which are almost an hour
A	mm
B	they seem
E	I don't think I like any HBO programmes
B	no
A	mm
E	they're awful

A	yeah
B	yeah
A	she has a very strange accent
B	quite a few things where she plays a British person
A	yeah
C	she just kind of overacts and
A	yeah
C	that annoys me
A	her face really annoys me actually
A	it's the faces she pulls as opposed to
C	yes
A	her face that I find I think it's it's the hamming
C	yeah
B	mm
C	mm
A	have you killed the chicks?
E	mm
A	oh
C	oh what have you done to the chicks?

B	yeah
A	but she's always really good live
E	she did a song with um that Eminem wannabe
A	professor Professor Green yeah
E	and if you close your eyes it's Eminem

B	but how does that prove that he was innocent?
C	exactly
E	because right the point was that they said that he'd got the diamond and then er got it into small pieces and sold it on
B	oh so he's stolen it okay
E	he's he's stolen it to prove that he was innocent
C	that he still had it oh
A	that he that he hadn't sold it
B	okay that makes sense
E	yeah it's a good film
A	it sounds awesome
E	I like um Sam Worthington he's good
A	I've not liked any of his films
E	Good
B	what else is he in?
E	terminator Salvation and Avatar
A	avatar
B	um Avatar looked like the worst film that I've ever seen in my life
A	it it is
E	I I well I like it
A	if you like FernGully with better effects
E	yeah
B	I used to love FernGully
A	fernGully was amazing
B	I watched it recently like a couple of years ago now and it was awful
A	I don't think it's aged well
B	it is the most boring film you've ever seen and it's like oh save the trees
A	yeah but I think for for young kids
B	no it's really really dull
A	it's quite it's quite fun
B	yeah
A	but it had Robin Williams and he played Batty
B	he played Batty and he did a rap
A	Tim Tim Curry plays the voice of the pollution
B	the oil
A	yeah
B	yeah it's really scary
A	and he sings
B	and he's like coming out of the machine and raps
A	mm
B	it was horrible
E	the only good film he ever did was Muppet Treasure Island
B	oh that's amazing
A	have you seen Rocky Horror Picture Show?
E	yeah but nowhere near as good as Muppet Treasure Island
B	yeah no Muppet Treasure Island is up there
E	possibly the best film I've ever seen
A	oh my God
E	by far
A	oh my God
E	and that the gay little er er boy is er Kevin Bishop
B	Kevin Bishop I know what the hell
B	my favourite character in that film was Blind Pew
E	blind Pew
B	I am Blind Pew that's a pretty little girl
B	oh it's so funny
A	possibly not my favourite film of all time though
E	it is
B	it possibly is the funniest one
E	I've watched it more than any other film
B	apart from the Muppets Christmas Carol
A	I was going to say I think I prefer the Christmas Carol
E	no I didn't like that anywhere near as much as the Treasure Island
B	I think
C	you you really liked that
A	I really liked it
E	and the songs the songs in the Treasure Island were so much better
C	we booked and took
B	apparently it's still terrible
C	even
A	yeah it's supposed to be awful
C	not funny
