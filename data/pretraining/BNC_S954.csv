A	I planned to actually sleep through the night at that point because I was so tired
B	mm
A	but then I woke up again at ten so
B	oh right yeah
A	mm
B	night is pretty
A	it was a pretty ambitious thought but
B	yeah
A	I that's how tired I was thinking I might be able to do it cos this is what my family does because they're weird like my mum can go to bed at like eight o'clock at night and sleep all night and I just don't understand how she does it
B	mm
A	but yeah
B	our
A	no
B	the thing you don't wanna hear isn't it? you know what I mean? like
A	they know where your blog is or they know you have a blog?
B	I don't know cos what happened was
A	my family know I think
B	do they know? oh how do you deal with it?
A	they know I have a blog but they don't know what my blog is
B	do they know what it is though? cos I'm worried that
A	no no no no
B	I'm worried that they know what it is is the problem
A	I tell them it's like a writers' blog
B	oh yeah
A	because it's partly true
B	yeah well like no that is for you cos you do actually
A	mm
B	and I kind of was like oh shit do you like know something that you wanna tell me? and then erm we had a bit of a fight so I just like hung up on her
A	oh my god
A	mm if she didn't know
B	and then just like just find out if she had been on it but she said something that kind of sounded like she might have an inkling and then I wrote that on my blog I wrote like I've gotta hope my mum didn't know about this blog I hope like
A	yeah
B	what I tell them in confidence I expect to be kind of kept in confidence
A	mm
B	and I was really quite angry
A	oh yeah
B	but I said like yeah I get what I get like kinda why you did it but you've just gotta like take this with a pinch of salt like I'm up here you know I'm writing all this stuff when I'm on my own and I do actually have people to talk to like I you know I've got you I've got the college I've got you know like I'm seeing counselling and stuff so they don't need to worry
A	mm mm
B	and she was like okay that's fine and then and then my other friend
A	no
B	so I don't actually know if she has
A	mm
B	like I I would hope they didn't but
A	I'm sure they wouldn't of told her
B	I know it just seems to be the no
A	I doubt they would have told her where you're at on your blog or what your URL is
B	I know but even so it's
A	but yeah it's not great
B	it's really like pissed me off a lot I kind of get why they did it but also I don't get why they did it because they know me and they know that that's like
A	your
A	mm
B	to piss
A	I mean if
A	if they said I'm worried about
B	yeah
A	like I wouldn't yeah
B	like why didn't they just tell me?
A	yeah mm
B	like why didn't they just say to me like I'm worried about you? because they haven't done that they've just been like like routinely asking if I'm okay
A	no
B	and then I said to
A	mm
B	cos that's what
A	mm
B	cos she looks on my blog anyway and it's just like
A	no I don't think you should have to do that
B	but I don't know if I can do that at the moment like I do think I mean I know it's like really toxic and I am like really dependent on it but
A	mm mm
B	but now I kind of only go on there to re-blog stuff and then if I get messages I'll answer them but I'm making a lot more like a lot less kind of actual like personal posts
A	yeah yeah
B	than I used to
A	definitely
B	which is kind of an improvement
A	well you shouldn't you shouldn't feel like you have to like there's nothing wrong with it but
B	well no it is
A	there is a point like where maybe it can detract from your real life
B	yeah definitely
A	just for your own yeah I mean for me now like I go on it in the evening a little bit
B	yeah
A	but I don't go on it during the day really
B	mm
A	which helps cos it's like routine maybe
B	mm
A	I dunno but yeah
B	yeah
A	mm mm
B	but yeah like when you're feeling really low you do get wrapped up in it and it's difficult not to
A	yeah definitely cos it's an easy way of expressing yourself really
B	well exactly that that's what like my argument is like I feel better talking like writing about it than I do actually like
A	mm
B	verbally speaking and
A	mm
B	I get that she's scared and she's worried and stuff but she shows it to her boyfriend er she shows it to her friends and they all know about it and it's just
A	yeah yeah
B	and she just gives out the name of it and it's like
A	that's not that's not right to be honest
B	no
A	I wouldn't ever give out anybody's Tumblr
B	no I know like I
A	went behind your back and did it yeah
A	ah
B	but enough of my stupid dramas
A	it's not stupid dramas
A	I get pissed off and anxious when people read my blog that I don't know
A	yeah
A	like some of my friends like
B	mm
A	people that it freaks me out a bit like people
B	oh god I know yeah
A	it's like okay like are you real or are you just trying to create drama? I don't know but
B	yeah like
A	yeah they say like I know you in real life and I think you're really cool and stuff I'm like okay
B	mm
A	it is strange but like I don't like the
B	no
A	like they don't get what my blog means and what I do on it and
B	no
A	stuff and
B	no I mean I hope my
A	mm
B	if I said anything on there that's like really bad which I have done in the past
A	mm
B	which is you know I should stop doing but
A	yeah
B	oh just like
A	er I mean like
B	that would be the worst nightmare in the world
A	mm
B	if they found my blog like if they were literally on my blog just imagine it
A	I mean er is your mum the kind of person who would like she would read it secretly er she'd keep reading it?
B	yeah she's nosy she's nosy like that
A	my you see my parents are like that
B	she's like extremely nosy like she's like Aunt Petunia nosy
B	like honestly my mum is Aunt Petunia there are so many similarities she's a neat freak she's nosy she cares about what the neighbours think
A	oh my god
B	she's quite severe she's really tall
A	does she have a lot of neck?
B	long neck long neck yep
B	honestly they are like the same person
A	she's Aunt Petunia
B	she's Aunt Petunia
A	really?
B	and my sister's yeah
A	oh
B	I left it lying around when she came to clean our rooms
A	is she how did you find that out? did she tell you?
B	no cos I found it in a different place
A	oh
B	I do certain things that like so I'll know exactly where it is and so I know exactly when someone hasn't moved it and it would it had moved
A	yeah yeah
A	yeah it does freak you out when parents like cos I don't I don't think like they really get it at all like why people do it they just think
B	no they really don't well it's just a different generation isn't it?
A	and I don't think yeah
B	they don't get that we're kind of Tumblr-obsessed this these days and we have been warped a little bit by you know what's on that website cos it's not all good like some of it's absolutely bullshit and people just need to go outside
A	mm
B	but
A	yeah
B	and you all have like of like common issues and interests and things like that
A	yeah definitely
B	but yeah like it's ironic really that I've stopped using a diary and started using Tumblr like
A	cos it is almost a diary
B	because it it feels more private to me than the Tumblr it's like
A	than a diary
B	a worldwide thing that anybody can see if they know my
A	if you ever wanted to keep a diary like here would be like the best place ironically
B	I know it would yeah
A	because like nobody's gonna come here in here and like steal it
B	yeah but typing's easier
A	yeah it is
A	it is like I've tried keeping diaries recently but if
B	yeah
A	blogging is easier
B	and people reply to you as well
A	yeah and try and comfort you and be like you're okay
B	and it's like yeah yeah I know and like I
A	the thing is though like people understand like like Tumblr is one of the only places left on the internet where you can like say shit without being judged
B	yes exactly
A	like they only say like now like on Facebook and Twitter they threaten you with erm like they say what is it they say? like employers will look at it and
B	yeah
A	not hire you and stuff
B	yeah
A	and it's like I dunno like I I I wouldn't want to post the sort of thing I write on Tumblr anyway to people that I know like no way in hell but Tumblr is just different like it's
B	mm
A	almost hidden within the depths of
B	it is
A	the world
B	yeah cos I
A	yeah yeah
B	and it really worries me
A	me too
B	like cos they sometimes like pick up on it and say like oh I saw that on your blog last week and I was like oh god you know about it too?
A	no
A	mm
B	to see it but then I think like some of the anons that I get must be people I know you know like this
A	yeah yeah
B	it must be
A	well who else would like
B	exactly
A	care
B	who else would like be so invested? like it's just erm I don't know it's really
A	cos you do get a few dodgy questions like
B	I do I know
A	well not even dodgy just strangely interested in certain bits
B	I know yeah
A	like some of them admit that they know me in real life and I'm like oh god who are
B	yeah
A	one of my best friends or something I'm like oh god cos like surely my
A	my best friends can just talk to me about shit
B	exactly
A	so it's not like
B	I know I sometimes think that
A	mm
B	but then sometimes like I get well not sometimes but a few a few times I've had people on Facebook like message me saying like oh I I know your blog like I've been like kind of following it a bit and I just wanted to say that I have a lot in common with you and shit and
A	wow okay
B	this is too much now it's
A	yeah yeah
B	a real life thing and this is not okay I can't deal with it I really can't
A	it's like when people on
B	yeah I know I put like oh you need to come off and on then and then but in reality I'm like no please don't I don't wanna ever know who you are like I'm too scared I don't I don't want it to be revealed I'd rather they stayed anonymous
A	yeah I part of me really wants to know but then another part of me is like plus when they're on Anon you can't block them
B	I know
A	so it's like
B	yeah
A	like the I wouldn't ever say I know you in real life on Anon cos I know it would freak somebody out like the only time you'd ever use Anon is like
B	yeah
A	you know?
B	no I probably would have I would do it on Anon I think I'm too shy for that
A	yeah if somebody had come across came across their blog or something and then I was just like but I wouldn't ever hint like I know who you are sort of thing you know
B	no
A	I know
B	cos you know they say to you like oh I know who you are I wish we were friends blah blah blah and then you're like okay well come on Anon and then we can you know whatever but then they just never reply like
A	I know
B	ever again it's really frustrating but also you're kind glad about it
A	no it isn't it's
B	the solution is to turn off Anonymous but I don't want to do that because
A	it's not worth it for the good anons you can get you know
B	yeah yeah yeah cos most of them like the majority of them which is really surprising cos I have a lot of problematic things on that blog that people could pick into and really have a go at me but mostly people are nice
A	they are like
B	mm
A	I have a feeling on my blog like people that do
B	yeah
A	you know sometimes some of them be like some sort of trigger like
B	yeah
A	personal stuff until something like major happens
B	yeah
A	whereas I've got other friends like they see my blog and say what's up are you okay?
B	mm
A	I saw your blog
B	so
A	not all of them only a few
B	oh yeah
A	yeah but I think others do though like cos
B	I know that's the problem like when you have one friend who knows it just gets out and it's just horrible
A	like I had like I think it was three friends that knew at the beginning that was it and then there's like there's some people though my friends who are friends with them found it because they've started re-blogging some of my stuff and I was like
B	yeah
A	oh god I didn't consider this
B	oh yeah
A	and then some of the girls in my sister's year were following me
B	oh no
A	so I'm like oh god please I bet you feed back to my sister
B	shit
A	about me and my life and I'm oh god but my sister like
B	oh that's horrible
A	my sister denies anything like she's just like your
B	yeah
A	but I'm like surely you are though because you're my sister
B	yeah
A	like you know
B	I know
A	so it's quite strange
B	why do we get so much flak for it? like we everyone does it
A	yeah
B	it's not that bad
A	I might just make a little page on my thing like if you know me in real life click this and I'm like if you
B	yeah
A	so just don't feed back stuff I say to friends
B	I know I've kinda done that I wrote that on my about me I said I don't have a filter so just like you know expect everything
A	yeah
B	just
A	yeah yeah they should do that
B	and it has been
A	exactly like it's just my outlet to express myself so
B	yeah which sounds totally like lame but it's true
A	it is it is like you can kind of release your mind onto it and not be feared of putting
A	no yeah
B	how it gets round
A	er I mean it's just
B	mm I I really wanna change my URL I dunno what to change it to
A	how about the opposite of what yours is so it could be
B	what like backwards?
A	no like used it use erm is it
B	oh like loud
A	loud and
B	loud and revealing
A	oh okay
B	ah
A	we need to think of something deep and meaningful
B	exactly exactly cos the first one's like
A	that is deep and meaningful we need to think of something even more deep and meaningful
A	how about
B	I made it when I was fourteen and I wasn't even like I was still fine at that point
A	mm okay
B	mm
A	yeah we don't want you to have to be like you know filling it with numbers
A	yeah
B	it was really bad
A	like fried chicken queen one
B	oh
A	it should be fried chicken queen that'll be amazing
A	erm
B	yeah I was thinking that but I don't know what
A	mm
B	oh who cares I'm gonna make food
B	yeah me too
A	lying on my bed and I felt so shit for so long
B	did you?
A	yeah just so bored
B	oh
A	but I was too tired to go and talk to anyone cos I was too tired
B	yeah same I felt really not like a
A	mm
B	wake yourself up and
A	woo
A	oh your bread I found out my milk goes off today and I cried
B	oh no
B	eleventh of bloody November for fuck's sake
A	what date is it today?
A	really?
B	how is that possible? I was eating
A	is it mouldy?
B	I dunno I bought it like after the eleventh
A	oh that's one thing I
B	unless it's mouldy like you can eat it can't you?
A	yeah of course
B	it's not just like
A	you can always toast it if you like toast
B	yeah
A	it's just cos it's like a bit stale but
B	no I don't it feels alright does that does that feel alright to you? it's like
A	that feels fine
A	touch my bread I'd love to
B	ah yay cat
A	I mean
B	especially when I stay cos I
A	yeah cos I think I think going home can help because
A	it doesn't feel like you're stuck
B	no
A	whereas with you I think it must feel a bit like
B	oh god absolutely like I was
A	yeah
B	cos our car probably wouldn't make it up here and even if I like went from my dad's house that's still like five hours
A	mm
B	and it's just just a fucking nightmare really like
A	no yeah
B	like cos they don't need that that's such a hassle
A	that's the thing like everything takes effort doesn't it? like
B	yeah
A	dropping out takes effort
B	mm
A	staying here it requires a degree of effort as well
B	yeah
A	slugs would be nice just being all slimy and stuff
B	yeah
A	plus our lifespan wouldn't be as long
B	exactly
A	she won't care
A	oh
B	this is what they meant when it's just constant rain
A	yeah this is this is the reality of our situation now we're just here
B	yeah we're
A	it was really nice when we first came here
B	it was yeah it was such a nice day and it was kinda like that for another week and
A	it really is
A	mm
A	it's a rot day today it's like
B	it's the fifteenth
A	so we've been here six weeks
A	six and a half
B	mm
A	it does feel longer than that so we've been here six
A	I don't know
B	I can't believe it's the fifteenth of November already Jesus
A	mm yep
B	come up
A	but then again we have by the by the time we get to next weekend it'll be three weeks till Christmas I think which it doesn't sound long does it? at all like I think a month sounds quite a while but then
B	what until Christmas day or until we break up?
A	break up
B	ah damn
A	don't get your expectations too high
B	is it three weeks this week?
A	is it this week?
B	I think so cos it was four weeks I remember saying it's four weeks till we break up
A	see what the date is today the date is the fifteenth
A	yeah
B	not it's no it's just under a month so it's not quite four weeks I think
A	alright okay that's good though
B	mm
A	oh it's gonna be so good and we'll be at home for a month how good is that?
B	mm
A	a month at home
B	I'll probably get sick of it though
A	you probably will you'll have to tell me how
B	I'll be
A	no I think I think a month is a
B	yeah
A	or first two weeks at least
B	mm
A	just yeah
B	yeah I think Christmas'll be good
A	cos Christmas is a nice time of year anyway like even if I it's kinda shit when you go home for the summer because there's not really that much to do but Christmas there's things going on
B	mm
A	like even probably where you live there's stuff going on
A	little bit going on
B	I dunno
A	how is it
B	how's it going? and it's just like no not doing it
A	if you can get through the first term and not hand in anything I would I'd get I'd take my hat off to you and you stay and that'll be amazing
A	it would be
A	but that's not an
B	it's not going to happen
A	it's not going to happen but
A	ah
B	mm
A	I've still not seen
B	I think I heard them coming out of their rooms though cos I
A	oh really?
B	by the way they walk
A	how do I walk?
B	erm usually quite like I don't know tiptoey it's not very loud
A	really? ah
B	and then
A	is she?
B	and
A	does she dash for it?
B	yeah a little bit and I think that's what the erm
A	the boys are slower
B	and
A	manly
B	really
A	manly
B	just sort of like strolls past
B	yeah and then
A	yeah
B	she always makes me jump like seriously
A	this is a really strange scenario but imagine if
B	scenario is it?
A	scenario but imagine if by the end of the year we realise one of our flatmates was a ghost
B	oh my god
A	oh
B	oh I don't
A	what your cheese?
B	yeah look it's the date's peeled off but it says one there that's definitely a one and then that's another figure
A	that looks like eighteen
B	I know that's what I'm hoping but it could be twelve as well
A	but it's got a little thingy there like a little inward thing
B	are you really telling me that you can determine that's an eighteen?
A	a little bit
A	no but like
B	instead of a twelve
A	it
A	I'm sure like is it mouldy? cos it's
B	or it could be fifteenth which is today I mean it looks alright I mean
A	if there's no mould on it and it's green then it's fine
B	it smells quite strong cos it's just strong cheese but I don't think it's
A	cheese is mould
B	is it just mould that makes it like I'm so proud of my
A	no honestly it will be fine
A	try a bit of it and if it's disgusting like chuck it but
B	yeah yeah
A	probably won't kill you though like a lot of people just like
B	oh it's alright
A	yeah
A	it's just if it starts growing stuff on it
A	yeah I mean I've started eating
B	oh
A	yeah
B	so cheese wish I had some salad or something
A	get some of your spinach
B	yeah my frozen
A	your frozen spinach
A	er
B	oh no I was gonna make pasta oh
A	with what?
B	so my sauce is going out everything is going out of date and I'm trying to eat it all
A	you could make that in the evening
B	yeah but I really won't want to eat all that
A	yeah
B	oh thirtieth that's fine
A	woo
A	I hate the way food goes out of date it's so annoying
A	eat certain things
B	yeah
A	woo
B	there's so much sugar in it
A	let's see what's going out of date in here
B	nothing
A	yeah it's so handy though like
B	never
A	erm
A	oh my god
A	yeah yeah
B	I keep thinking it's sixteen now for some reason
A	no oh well I like it when it's an even number I don't know why I have some satisfaction with that
B	I know yeah oh thirteen was just like the worst year ever
A	yeah it was just like what the fuck is going on?
B	tofu?
A	yeah
B	uh no
A	it's fried though it's marinated it's not just plain
B	oh that makes it better
A	it's really it's really nice though it's almost like
B	I don't know what I'm saying
A	some people hate it but this looks quite good it's like
B	yeah
A	yeah
A	yeah
A	it's like cos I don't like just plain tofu it's boring if you have like stuff in it it's protein and it's nice
B	so did you like have Quorn instead of meat or do you just have vegetables and stuff?
A	I have Quorn beans try to buy tofu now vegetarian sausages occasionally erm
A	what?
B	what are they made of?
A	they're like they can be Quorn they can be like nutty stuff they can be all sorts of stuff erm what else have I got? I usually buy spaghetti
A	it is it is quite you do feel quite good being vegetarian
B	yeah
A	but it depends what you have like sometimes I just have a mountain of cheese and it's like
B	yeah
A	cos it's just quicker
B	have you ever been
A	no well I don't think I could be
B	no
A	I feel like too much stuff I eat is based on like milk and
B	do you eat eggs?
A	yes
B	yeah
A	and like fish like
B	yeah
A	salmon and oh my god I can't wait to go home at Christmas and have smoked salmon
A	I'm so excited
A	yeah we have erm smoked salmon we have not on Christmas Day we have it on like for the you know when the like you know in the evenings on Christmas not on the actual day cos we don't usually have to on Christmas Day it's all still full
B	do you not?
A	well we have like crackers and shit but we don't have like a big meal
B	that's so unusual
A	we have erm
A	we have turkey sandwiches for anyone that's hungry but I'm usually just like cheese biscuits and shit
B	well my family eats like so much it's really
A	yeah yeah that's what we have
B	and we'll have like snacks as well as that cos we usually have a little party with the family and then Christmas Day we'll have erm Christmas dinner like the whole thing probably second helpings

A	oh my god
B	food it's too much

B	yeah I know
A	and then it's like ah
B	ah Christmas food is like the best after Italian food

A	exactly
A	I know
B	horrible man

B	well it isn't exactly
A	it is not
B	animals really
A	I know
A	er da da da
B	I think this map's like fairly useless
B	cos it's like an old style map
A	it is actually it's very pretty it's very
B	I know it's nice to look at but it's not really that helpful with geography
A	I mean
B	I can hardly see anything
B	right what's your explanation then?
A	here we go
B	oh man
A	yeah and you need
B	and I feel like I'm entitled to now cos I'm just gonna go for it
A	scream your head off do what you want
A	I'm not helping with your anger
B	you're not you're you're supposed to

B	yes oh yes
A	yes
B	absolutely no subtlety here
A	she won't what?
B	she I said to her that I don't feel comfortable with you talking to my auntie about anything full stop and then she says okay I won't
A	but she's already done it
B	and she already does every time she sees my auntie
A	mm
B	and she has done for probably about two years now oh my god
A	mm maybe say
B	yeah I was
A	you can maybe also say that when you get angry and upset and struggle on Tumblr that is very much in the moment like you are gonna look back on that in hindsight like an hour later
B	yeah definitely
A	and be like I feel less bad
A	yeah so it's it's not an accurate representation of like the whole time like when you post I know when I post something on Tumblr I'm I'm usually like I hate everything
A	and I do I might feel like that for the whole night but in the morning I feel a little bit better at least you know?
B	mm
A	even if it is only a tiny bit better
B	yeah
A	of somebody I know has got a cat as their profile picture instead of changing it they just put the cat on a flag
A	yeah
B	yeah that's what you do isn't it? it's like a Facebook thing
A	yeah
B	I was gonna do it but then I thought like it's not just France that's having this problem like I don't really wanna just
A	that's what yeah cos I've done it but now I've been just looking at it and it's like these other countries that have actually
B	yeah exactly
A	and there's countries that experience this
A	the important Western yeah
A	can you imagine?
B	oh Miss Trunchbull every time
A	yeah Miss Trunchbull
B	wow
A	yeah I was I know it's a Facebook quiz but I was quite proud of that even though that is hereditary it's not anything to do with me
A	it's like yes do you have a pilot's vision? yes you do
B	wow
A	so I could be a well I couldn't be a pilot if I wanted to because there's other stuff involved but
B	you could you could be anything you want to be
A	oh you inspirational you
B	I know
A	it's just effort isn't it? like
B	I know everything comes back to that
A	getting everything sorted
B	yeah
A	they're like sorry for the selfie it's like no don't ever apologise for your selfieing ah

B	I know
A	or er a lovely view of whatever is out there
B	exactly
A	the mist the fog you see if we could just get easily in the country it would be rather nice like if

A	like
B	god

B	I know I dunno how she stands it here? not I really
A	I get really crazy cos I think the only
B	I suppose it's cos she gets to go home so often

B	I know
A	who gives them this money?
B	and the thing about him like my men'll do it sounds kinda like Mafia
A	it does
B	sounds
A	like what do how do you transfer money? like what information do you give? you give your sort code
B	yeah and your account number
A	which is the account number? that's on the back isn't it?
B	no it's it's the big long one on the on the front yeah
A	on the front?
B	I'm pretty sure
A	what's the one on the back then?
B	that's your sort code
A	is it?
B	yeah
A	is is sort code the
B	oh wait no it isn't no that's your security
A	sort code is six digits
B	yeah sort code's the little one on the front no I'm wrong no the back is security code

B	that's for when you're logging in like you need that to prove like who you are and shit
A	mm yeah yeah but they won't be able to like access my bank account then?

A	great great awesome well thank you for your help because I'm clueless about those sort of things I always do Paypal
B	but if you're sending it through Paypal I don't know how it works cos I've never
A	Paypal's pretty easy but he can't do it that way cos he doesn't have it which
B	no
A	I can imagine if you're rich you wouldn't need Paypal to send money
A	oh wow okay
B	making quite a bit of money to be honest
A	that's really good
B	that was kind of how I supported myself without a job but
A	what did you sell?
B	sell now so I can't do it anymore
A	how much did you sell shit for?
B	I sold all my old clothes
A	wow
B	yes yeah cos I had this like I had this erm Kurt Geiger coat thing that I found at a car boot
A	yeah
B	and that's like really expensive
A	wow
B	to buy so I made that like
A	that's really cool
A	I could yeah to be honest I could sell I could sell some of my old clothes
B	mm yeah
A	cos I've got so many old stuff at home that's still in good condition like I got one of my old prom dresses
B	mm yeah
A	that I wore once and I could sell that for about forty quid
B	no it's all about how you like stage it like cos I always used to put them on a hanger on a white wall and it just made it look like really clean and you could just see what it was
A	yeah definitely
B	yeah people would just
A	wow
B	and erm I was like really ruthless about it cos I was like I'm usually really attached to my clothes but I just felt like no I I never wear this I'm selling it
A	you can buy new ones if you did that yeah
B	and and ever since I haven't thought about all the old clothes I've sold like I'd never have though about like wearing them
A	missing it
B	no so it's really
A	mm

A	she like this is she must think like this is some serious shit
B	yeah well it is serious shit I'm very angry about this
A	I would be to be honest like
B	like this is one of my insecurities as well like my family knowing all this shit that I tell me friends like it's not okay with me
