A	no the battery is there's like the charge
B	oh no power?
A	yeah
B	oh right well yeah normally when I plug in the computer it you go to the back of the camera I should have said and it says PC or what you're doing and you click okay on it
A	what even when it's not on?
B	yeah cos it's getting power from your computer
A	cos it it just wouldn't do any it just said no battery and it just went black

A	where you take the card out of your camera
B	yeah
A	and you plug it in and it
B	oh
A	reads it so you can put it the pictures on your computer
B	so then you've plugged that machine in the
A	yeah
B	right
A	cos it
B	cos some cards will go straight into the computer won't they?
A	yeah but yours is funny so you need a card reader
B	well yeah it won't go in mine no
A	but we are er he's got like four different slots on it
B	right
A	like it's got SD as well like sometimes we use it for our SD ones cos sometimes if you plug it straight into the computer it doesn't work even with an SD
B	oh right
A	so the card reader usually always works
B	mm mm
A	have you got to get anything from the shop?
B	no I suppose I could do with getting some food but I've got some for tonight
A	oh right
B	I thought I'd do that I don't know what I want so I don't think I'll start shopping for food now
A	mm
B	I don't really have anything in mind I mean I've got
A	mm
B	getting some fruits and veg maybe stuff like that
A	is this
B	yeah we're coming into
A	not far is it?
B	it's changed a bit I know you're getting close to it and it's changed a bit since having the tram put in
A	oh I dunno
B	I can't see it oh here it is to the right here so if we maybe take a left here and then turn around and go down that way I think
A	I know yeah
B	we might get a bit of heavy rain soon
A	yeah I think it's supposed to rain today
B	mm
A	is
B	he's off sick at the minute
A	oh is he?
B	he's got a kidney problem which
A	oh
B	is what your grandad has isn't it?
A	yeah
B	but it's I think this is slightly different
A	yeah
B	and he's got a kidney infection
A	they're supposed to be painful aren't they anything to do with kidneys?
B	yeah mm
A	like kidney stones are painful aren't they?
B	yeah
A	how did he get that?
B	who?
B	well he had it a few years ago and it's just one of those things isn't it?
A	mm
B	so I'm not sure what causes it
A	you can't catch it can you?
B	no
B	well I think everybody does really though don't they?
A	like mine's quite severe though
B	what?
A	that Rook over there
A	just ate a worm
B	yeah?
A	yeah that's why I'm always online like
B	it's the worst thing you can do is to go online
B	no wonder you have a fear of it if you read the stuff that's online
B	well yeah some of the stuff says you will die immediately and and
B	ridiculous the stuff you get online
A	oh so is that what I have to worry about when I'm old? I'm gonna be like what's wrong with me?
B	if you look after yourself there's no reason why you want to be worrying about when you're older either
A	yeah
B	so it's er you take care of yourself don't you?
A	but some things it's like yeah
B	well some things you
A	there's no explanation you can just get it and I'll be like
B	well if you have a proper illness you'll know about it
B	you don't wanna go looking online for it
B	I mean
A	because
B	your body'll tell you you're not well
A	cos some stuff it's like oh to avoid getting this make sure you eat vegetables and I'm like okay I'll eat vegetables but there's some stuff is like you can't prevent this and I'll be like
B	well yeah I mean some stuff you if if you get it you get it but you know the general advice is to keep healthy is you exercise and eat healthily isn't it?
A	yeah
B	so if you follow that advice then it it helps and if you still get something there's nothing you could have done about it anyway
A	no
B	if you get something you do but
B	generally if you you shouldn't expect to be getting anything
A	no
B	especially as you're so young and everything and healthy
A	yeah
B	you just need to
A	yeah
B	you know try to rest yourself when you're tired and things
A	yeah
B	don't go out partying all the time
A	oh because that's
B	cos it's gonna tire you
A	because that's what I was gonna do more likely don't stay up all night in the library that's twenty-four hour
B	yeah
