A	that does out war outdoor
B	gear okay
A	cos I was deciding I was gonna get these trousers
B	oh right really?

B	yeah
A	and then you can't really tell
B	yeah
A	slim fitting and things that are like this
B	well yeah
A	and I thought I don't really wanna be
B	no
A	if they make me look horrendously huge
B	no
A	like I'm wearing a black plastic bag
B	a plastic
A	that's what they did look like
A	so because you were late today I thought oh I'm gonna spend time
B	yeah
A	and go and try a pair on
B	yeah
A	so I went in there was this lovely Indian girl in there
B	yeah
A	cheapest you've got
B	yeah
A	and she was showing me erm
B	wow
A	but fourteen ninety-nine I'm thinking oh online I saw eight ninety-nine six ninety-nine but you don't know what you're getting do you? this is the thing
B	no you don't and the you don't know if you're going to be able to breathe in them
A	yeah exactly
B	you know if you're cycling in them?
A	yeah
B	you know
A	they could be like
B	yeah
A	if you're sweating on the inside you feel that bad
B	yeah
A	anyway I said to her well you know that torrentious rain we had last week
B	mm
A	I just managed to avoid most of it in the rowing and I've got to tell you all about the rowing
B	oh right
A	so
B	you rowing?
A	I've starting rowing yes
B	fantastic
A	yes
B	how nice is that? that must be lovely
A	I I did do it
B	to do
A	well I I only was er out on the water for about
B	yeah
A	five minutes
B	have you ever done it before?
A	no no no I've done kayaking a little bit of kayaking and canoeing
B	yeah
A	completely
B	are you rowing on your own? on your own?
A	yeah you're on your own
B	right
A	she had me on a tow rope at least
B	right
A	luckily so I didn't float off
B	are you taking lessons?
A	yes
B	yeah okay
A	promise
B	right yeah
A	and erm
B	yeah
A	oh these'll be no good it's only up to two thousand I said what does that mean? she said it's the
B	okay
A	or something
B	yeah
A	and about how waterproof they are she said oh no they'll just be sticking to your legs
B	yeah
A	try these at five thousand
B	right
A	so I brought these so I've had them on they're only three pounds more
B	okay
A	so for three pounds so I thought
B	that's brilliant
A	I was gonna buy
B	which shop is that?
A	just in the
B	the er outdoor shop?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	twenty thousand I think or something
A	okay alright yeah
B	cos I need to get a pair
A	so I tried them on and I said oh well give me large
B	were they?
A	huge
A	so I tried the medium on fine
B	oh good
A	they went over my skirt
B	yeah yeah
A	and everything
B	and they're long enough for you?
A	and they're long enough
B	yeah yeah
A	and it thought actually this has really made my day
B	yeah
A	so I came out and I went to really made my day that I've got
B	yes
A	only a medium
A	cos usually I have to get extra large
B	yeah to get the length
A	when I got some
B	yeah
A	when I get I got I got these knee supports before we went skiing last year
B	right
A	and erm
B	yeah
A	and erm I had to have you got a large? ended up getting extra large
B	oh no
A	now my knees look at my knee
B	no
A	imagine anyone who's quite big
B	were these salopettes?
A	no no this was just for the
B	what were they?
A	knee supports
B	oh the knee supports
A	the knee supports
B	right okay I see what you mean right yeah
A	so er and that that I wore underneath the salopettes
B	yeah yeah
A	and it made it I think it really was very useful
B	yeah
A	to have them
B	yeah
A	and I thought anybody with very longish legs
B	yeah you'd never get them on
A	they would never get them on
B	they'd have to have especially
A	they would be they would be
B	made or something
A	yeah
B	yeah oh yeah it makes a big difference doesn't it?
A	that's right that's
A	well exactly
B	because erm I need to get a pair
A	oh do you?
B	oh yeah definitely
A	I just thought well if I'm gonna do this
B	for my
A	well I've signed up for six weeks
B	wow
A	and for over-fifties these are the joys of being over fifty my darling
A	over-fifties you can put your name I've had my name down for three years and she phoned me at the beginning of the summer and said I've got a
B	yeah
A	and you get and I couldn't do it cos I was teaching at
B	yeah
A	said well I'll phone you back again don't worry
B	and you've had your name on the list for three years?
A	yeah
B	that's that popular?
A	yes
B	well I can imagine it being popular let me have a look yeah I can see it being particularly
A	but I've always looked I've always looked at people on the river thinking I wanna do that
B	yeah it looks so sort of serene and
A	and so now
B	and kind of you know
A	yeah
B	and stuff
A	but they put you in a single man thing
B	today?
A	yeah on your own cos you learn in the single one and then when you know how to do it you
B	right
A	go in with in a double
B	you're learning the strokes yeah okay
A	cos I thought you'd go in a double
B	straight away yeah
A	with the tutor behind you
B	yeah
A	maybe I'll get to that
B	that's half price today then?
A	half price so seventeen
B	that's brilliant
A	something I paid
B	they but they look really good
A	and it's also they come in this little bag as well
B	the bag as well so you can handle
A	so you can just have the bags yeah
B	yeah
A	and as I say the
B	half price I might go and have a look
A	I'm still gonna be
B	half price today yeah
B	yeah
A	cos you don't wanna be
B	yeah
A	having to take your boots off to get them on you know?
B	five thousand that would be good yeah
A	yeah so that is the thing to look for so
B	yeah okay I will I'll go and have a look
A	and it says breathable as well yeah
B	yeah I really do need a pair and an affordable price
A	you'll be a small
B	well yeah I'll probably have to roll them up as well
A	yeah they
A	yeah
B	six weeks' worth of it?
A	yeah so
B	yeah
A	the first week mainly was just taking me round the yard
B	yeah
A	and explaining the rules
B	showing you the equipment oh the rules? right okay
A	the rules of the river
B	oh right oh
A	cos you've got to go on the right hand side
B	right
A	so it's like continental driving
B	okay
A	and it was so funny cos she took me out on the boat er the little boat it's called a virus so I thought oh you could have called it something nicer
B	yeah virus?
A	it's called virus
B	yeah
A	V I R U S so
B	oh right okay
A	I'll ask her another time why it's called that
B	yeah
A	no
A	but I sat in it
B	yeah
A	on the bank and it's
B	oh right
A	yeah it it's like it's only hip width
B	it's really oh okay so
A	the
B	quite quite shallow then
A	and it's very shallow yeah it's amazing so you
B	so you really
A	really need your balance
B	could topple in by
A	yeah yeah so
B	wow
A	on Saturday next Saturday I'm going for my capsizing training
B	oh in the swimming pool? yeah
A	in the swimming pool at
B	yeah okay yeah yeah thank god
A	cos when they told me I had to do capsizing I said oh I really don't fancy that in the river she said oh no we're not gonna do that to you
B	oh god no
A	there's so many
B	you don't know what you'll catch
A	but they talk regularly about if you fall in or
B	yeah
A	when you fall in
B	yeah
A	not like you're never gonna fall in
B	oh right yeah you you will at some point yeah
A	I'm hoping not
B	well maybe not in the six weeks
A	very
B	well it's quite a
A	yeah
B	it's a great thing for
A	yeah
B	and for your back
A	yeah
B	for your posture
A	yeah I suppose
B	and your and your arms
A	yeah I suppose so yeah
B	and your legs I mean that's the good thing about rowing it's so different from kayaking isn't it?
A	yeah it's completely different
B	cos kayaking you've got cos you don't use your legs at all it's all
A	no you don't
B	your upper body
A	yeah
B	it's quite boring in a way I've done it a bit
A	have you? yeah
B	kayaking we even did it on
A	oh did you?
B	which is where
A	oh my god
B	everything was during the day but everything was pandemonium it's like yeah
A	were there a lot of big boats going by?
B	busy busy busy oh yeah big boats jellyfish sharks
A	oh no
B	we had the whole works we saw all of it that day
A	you didn't?
B	all of it and then I got out and er I said to
A	well it's
B	you've got to go all the way back
A	you're very on the water as well aren't you?
B	yeah
A	it's quite it's not like canoeing
B	yeah
A	canoeing is dead easy
B	and we were in separate kayaks
A	yeah yeah yeah oh yeah
B	we weren't in your know double kayaks and stuff
A	no no no
B	so you know so I was a bit freaked out
A	yeah yeah
B	and of course you've got all the big ferries
A	I was gonna say
B	I could've didn't have like a cruise ship going by which you could have had you know cos they are obviously going down there all the time
A	they're massive aren't they?
B	we saw
A	and you get the weight don't you get the waves?
B	yeah you get the waves you get the whole thing you get you know the jellyfish and the sharks
A	did you actually see a shark?
B	yeah
A	how big a little a little a baby?
B	well I don't know I mean
A	bigger than bigger than
B	it was just passing by
A	well I know but still
B	it could have been big or it could have been small but I
A	it was dark I would have thought yeah
B	I know what it looks like you know
A	oh right
B	I wasn't imagining it you know
A	no no no no
B	erm but no we it was it was just quick it was quick and obviously you know more it was more scared of me probably but erm but yeah no kayaking I found when I got home I was like ah ah
A	ah yes
B	but like my legs were alright
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	cos at least with rowing you get that
A	you do yeah
B	you have to push
A	you've got to go up and down there's a little machine called
B	yeah
A	a an ergo
B	oh yeah
A	and I've got all this new vocab
B	are you doing all that now? yeah
A	and I was so keen I said she said oh well come and do ten or fifteen minutes on the ergo every time
B	yeah
A	you come the lesson starts at eleven I said well does that mean I should come at twenty to? she went
B	yeah
A	no no no just come at eleven o'clock she was like
A	oh bit keen this one
B	conscientious
A	yeah I do
B	you wanna get obviously cos
A	no I want to
B	to make it better it'll be
A	yeah
B	when you're fitter it'll be so much more fun you know
A	yeah
B	it'll be more enjoyable
A	exactly when I'm not
B	yeah
A	worried about falling in
B	well as well
A	and the funny thing was I so I I managed to get in fine it wasn't too unstable either
B	yeah yeah
A	she pushes me off I'm like
B	and see if you can balance
A	ah
B	yeah
A	cos she has to get hold of the oar and push
B	right
A	so I had push against it
B	okay yeah
A	but that was okay
B	yeah
A	so I've got these two oars and she said okay move your left hand move the left oar up and down couldn't do it
B	just one at a time?
A	the brain yeah
B	yeah
A	the brain wasn't sending the
B	no cos you're
A	message down
B	yeah you're still trying to
A	to the hand
B	yeah to
A	it was so funny
B	but that's interesting isn't it?
A	yeah
B	it just goes to show it's actually
A	it goes to show yeah
B	quite difficult yeah to move in the water
A	I wanted to learn a new skill
B	yeah learn a new skill yeah
A	any new skill
B	yeah
A	you know when you
B	yeah
A	you know how to do something
B	yes
A	you it takes you a certain
B	just time
A	oh just do this
B	for your brain to kind to think about it
A	yeah
B	yeah yeah
A	and I couldn't do it I I was just
B	yeah
A	laughing my head off it was
B	yeah that's good
A	so funny I got the hysterics
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	and I was going and and it I was going
B	you were just like oh I can't do it I can't do it
A	move your
B	wow
A	maybe only five or ten seconds
B	yeah
A	but then she goes
B	yeah cos you were right handed so you're alright yeah
A	and then she said do alternate
B	oh
A	and I just the brain
A	it was so funny
B	it's great
A	and they all seemed quite no I shouldn't I shouldn't generalise
B	is she what?
A	quite eccentric old ladies
B	oh she's an eccentric old lady?
A	well I'd say
B	oh right
A	she's eccentric
B	I thought she was gonna be
A	or maybe she's not well I don't know you just get the
B	be a young 'un or something
A	no no no she's retired oh they're all they're all all all over fifty
B	of course
A	so they learn and then later on they can train other people if they
B	very good
A	get into it
B	is it more of a women's thing?
A	it's only women's this is a
B	oh okay
A	no it's not there were men no there was
B	okay
A	some men
B	yeah okay so it's
A	well maybe it's anybody over-fifties
A	yeah
B	the instructors
A	right yeah yeah yeah
B	but so she was what a bit slightly of a
A	no no no I I'm just generalising she seemed very sweet very nice
B	yes
A	very methodical very slow cos I can be quite
B	yeah
A	but she said she said er we're not into you know cos I'm I don't know I was just the way I had my ear rings on at the time
B	yes
A	she said we're not into we don't do Lycra
B	yeah
A	or any of the
B	yeah
A	she said just come in small trainers
B	yeah
A	but I do don't don't do trainers
B	no
A	I've only just discovered trainers with my
B	yeah
A	so I said well I haven't really got any old ones and I went in Wellingtons cos it was really really throwing it down
B	yeah yeah
A	she said no no Wellingtons are a big no no cos if you go over they just fill up in the water
B	with water
A	and they pull you down
B	yeah
A	or you lose them or whatever
B	yeah
A	so I had this these a pair of very very old shoes that I used to go dancing in
B	yeah
A	so I thought
B	yeah
A	I'll be able to
B	yeah okay alright
A	so this this morning the other thing I did
B	yeah?
A	because I had time was I went and bought some very cheap trainers
B	oh good
A	for nine ninety-nine
B	yeah so you can get those wet
A	and is so
B	it doesn't matter
A	so it doesn't matter if
B	yeah
A	they get wet and muddy
B	yeah
A	and so
B	yeah
A	all these swans you know
B	yeah
A	and the
B	yeah
A	trampling in swan poo and
B	oh yeah you will be
A	and so
B	yeah
A	so
B	far you'll get in six weeks I wonder where the
A	well I've heard
B	objectives are
A	yeah
B	did she tell you what your outcomes are meant to be?
A	er
B	has she been
A	teacher talking
A	no well no no there's a checklist that we did she said oh well I think we can check everything off
B	oh right
A	she was ticking everything off at the end of the day
B	and jolly
A	I thought I've only been on the water for five minutes
A	hardly yeah yeah
B	and that and that
A	no and she's planning to be able to take me she'll probably be in a boat ahead or behind me
B	yeah
A	or something
B	yeah
A	erm and you go all the way up to er
B	lovely
A	eventually
B	wow
A	and then down to
B	it's so pretty up there isn't it?
A	she gave me a map
B	wow so actually quite far for a beginner
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	yeah
A	I don't know whether I'll manage to do all that that
B	yeah
A	it depends how I get how I get on
B	yeah
A	so er
B	but it's a nice objective to have
A	yeah it is isn't it?
B	to get up there
A	yeah
B	cos it's really pretty isn't it?
A	I don't mind cos I'm
B	yeah
A	I'd quite like to get up there away from all the other
B	well yes
A	boats
B	yeah
A	and you know when you see the
B	yeah yeah
A	eightman
B	they're gliding
A	quite small
B	yeah
A	well they look big from the
B	yeah
A	when you see them they're like double the length
B	oh that's lovely thank you very much
A	oh thank you so much
unknown_female	there ain't no more love sorry about that
A	they are
B	and they're probably big blokes as well aren't they?
A	well there are all sorts there they have
B	oh really?
A	they share they share erm
B	is it the one down near erm
A	it's near er
B	yeah okay I know where you mean yeah
A	so it's further along than the others
B	yeah
A	you know you see them
B	mm wow mm
A	so that is my latest
B	mm fantastic
A	and it's nice it's once a week
B	mm mm
A	so I've been practicing now cos I realised what is tricky looking over your shoulder
B	yeah
A	it's actually quite hard
B	yeah and keep going forwards
A	you you're moving all your body
B	mm
A	you can't move all your body cos
B	mm
A	the whole thing will just go over
B	mm
A	so
B	mm
A	I've been practicing on the bike going like this
B	mm
A	probably see something out of the corner of your eye
B	mm
A	so if it's just me on the water I'm fine
B	mm
A	but all the other people
B	the others well
A	I've got to avoid
B	mm mm
A	no
B	it's not like you're learning
A	and there's all the houseboats on both sides
B	on the Thames or something yeah that's right
A	they're on both sides now
B	mm
A	so there are a lot more houseboats like she said to me there are a lot more houseboats now
B	yeah yeah
A	yeah
B	really nice
A	yeah
B	wow
A	and also just erm
B	well it is
A	I'm just gonna shall I get some salt?
B	yeah if you wouldn't mind
B	lovely thank
B	erm now when did I see you last? oh I saw you last Friday didn't we?
A	mm
B	and erm oh yes I told you all about my erm mum's half-sister yeah I told you all about that
A	no you didn't there was no time
B	oh
A	you said you'd met
B	mm
A	your mum's
B	so we'd run out of time to talk talk about that right okay erm oh yeah so no she is this adorable Welsh woman erm and
A	where where did you discover did you always know she was there?
B	no not at all so what happened is that my
A	oh right so this is after she died?
B	and there's this guy
A	that's a shame
B	called
A	yeah
B	and erm
A	is
B	yeah if I could measure your children
A	mm and they've been asking for some time
B	mm
A	yeah
B	but oh no you know of course he wrote back and said you know he says it's
A	mm mm mm mm
B	and then he went on to say what he'd been doing for the last
A	oh
B	is is the family that he's been fascinated by and he's been doing all this research into it
A	so wait a minute so can I go back up one thing so this is your mum's dad
B	mm
A	who had your mum is your mum born first or after they were
B	my mum was born first
A	mm yeah
B	and so mum er my gran
A	then the second marriage is the other
A	yeah
B	became
A	oh right so does oh you don't know did your mum remember him? you don't know?
B	oh yeah
A	oh yeah yeah your dad
B	oh my yeah
A	oh yeah right
B	that's the thing
A	oh I see she remembered him in that way
B	because erm as far as she was concerned she he turned his back on her as a child
A	now how much younger is she?
B	she's what sorry?
A	how much younger is she than your mum would have been?
B	well this is what I'm trying to figure out because
A	because then you can figure out when they got together and when their
B	mm
A	their children
B	well I think it's true that
A	yeah
B	and it's probably quite fair to say that in those days divorce isn't something you just do with the flick of your wrist
A	no well
B	you actually had to have a reason
A	they don't talk about it
B	as well to get divorced in those days
A	yeah
B	you couldn't just go well actually I don't
A	no
B	you had to have a real reason and normally that was adultery
A	and usually it was adultery yeah yeah
B	so
A	so the the they didn't manage to get divorced I presume?
B	they they got divorced
A	oh they did?
B	they did granny pretty much hightailed it out of erm
A	no
B	they missed each other by one year
A	oh
B	so
A	oh okay right but she didn't wanna see her dad so she didn't wanna
B	mm
A	didn't wanna find out about her
B	even she told me you know about erm eight or nine years ago she'd actually
A	yeah
B	about my mum
A	yeah
B	but my granny would have been well into the idea
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	cos I just know what my granny was like
A	so it sounds like your mum had her in contact then
B	I
A	and maybe she just decided oh I don't want anything to do with them
B	I she did I'm I'm sure that they both of them knew granny my granny and my mum knew
A	mm
B	so they were while I was growing up particularly in my twenties
A	yeah
B	to have to know anything about
A	yeah yeah
B	and I thought this was just some sort of Welshness you know cos I always thought the Welsh were quite introvert and
A	yeah gushing
B	yeah that's right so I just thought that was just a counter thing
A	yeah
B	mm
A	mm
B	and that's really quite strange because as erm
A	well yeah
B	and it wasn't right next to where they all lived either there was
A	no
B	you know they'd actually made an effort to go to study at this place so now and then the the themes in the family so she's done this incredible amount of research she has teems and teems and teems of this stuff she's obviously somebody who likes that you know ancestry and everything
A	mm
B	she's very good at it and erm she she actually got me back to you know I think eighteen forties so I was there for a couple of hours and we weren't just talking about that but
A	no no no
B	it was quite like a nice way to learn about a
A	oh now there are so it's so much easier I remember my dad did it
B	right
A	you had to go to actual libraries
B	mm
A	and registry offices and
B	mm
A	go through huge tomes
B	mm
A	which is kind of more exciting
B	yeah
A	but it takes a lot of time
B	well they did and they went up to London
A	yeah
B	and she's actually been in a wheelchair for about twenty-five years I think she told me so she put down she's sixty-seven
A	oh right yeah
B	so no she has an elder daughter and a you know a son whereas it was the other way round for my mum but they had a
A	yeah it's interesting
B	and er the even
A	I tell you the more I look
B	all about the coincidences
A	do they look similar?
B	mm
A	can you kind of see
B	mm mm
A	cos resemblance
B	my
A	is a strange thing is isn't it? it's features but it's also manners and
B	it's manners
A	and how you speak
B	well she's put it his way she's
A	and she wouldn't have those from your dad
B	she's lovely when she said oh absolutely not she said to me erm when we were leaving she was in her wheelchair and she was you know at the door at her front door
A	yeah of course
B	but the other thing is that there she I showed her the letter because this
A	ah
B	which my mother had
A	oh
B	because they come over
A	yeah yeah
B	really
A	yeah yeah I'm gonna end up with that
B	and mummy had that too so up to you know probably early sixties she didn't but then from the sixties onwards she definitely did and she used to say the same thing
A	funny isn't it?
B	mm
A	you see your mum didn't wanna meet her otherwise she would have she would have met all those years ago wouldn't she?
B	I think it was well out of loyalty
A	she would have
B	I think it was some perceived loyalty to my grandmother
A	yeah
B	my grandmother is a pretty easy going person and she was the one who said look let let sleeping dogs lie that was
A	is your grandmother alive still or not?
B	no
A	oh
B	she died a couple of years before mummy
A	oh you see you can't discuss it either with her
B	can't discuss it with her
A	this is the frustration when people die you can't talk about anything anymore
B	I I know
B	but I'm lucky
A	and you just wanna say I wanna ask you this
B	I know
A	and you can't
B	at least I'm lucky I have still like a connection to a blood connection
A	mm
B	to the
A	mm
B	and er in in many ways it's kind of helped me to understand that
A	yeah
B	learn more about yourself by thinking about why is it that I'm interested in teaching? why is it that I'm interested in writing? why is it I'm interested in filmmaking? why is that research what not
A	yeah yeah
B	much further
A	no no no no
B	that's why I'm I
A	yeah exactly
B	you know
A	yeah
B	so
A	so is he still alive?
B	no he passed away in nineteen ninety-nine
A	oh dear this is the terrible thing isn't it?
B	I know
A	do you want a glass of water?
B	yes please yeah
A	I don't think we've got time for tea or coffee or anything
B	no we haven't
A	unless you want a cup of tea here
B	oh yeah
A	shall we have a cup of tea?
B	have a cup of tea yeah that's good
A	yeah I'll get a tea
B	no
A	cos I wanna sit on the side so I can see the
B	okay is your friend turning up too?
A	yeah
B	mm well we'll get there like
A	yeah it's more I just wanna be able to sit somewhere
B	yeah cool
A	well that's amazing
B	it is amazing and I'll tell you the last thing that's even I mean you know I
A	are you gonna keep in contact with her?
B	oh yes
A	oh yeah
B	we're gonna do it again she's gonna show me how
A	oh that's nice
B	to erm get started but I tell you there was a bit about my own family as in erm my mother's my grandmother's side of the family
A	yeah
B	cos I've got loads of black and white photographs of them and I'm a little bit mesmerised by my grandmother's father because he was a really dashing chap and he had all sorts of adventures around the world and he was the captain of a ship an engineering captain on a big cruise liner and he did lots of things during the first
A	where does she live? in Wales?
A	oh that's not far
B	now this is the weird thing right get this
A	is this the
B	the first few
A	the first time he's
B	the first time he
A	first time?
B	ever clapped eyes on her and lo and behold he sees one of his old work colleagues through British British Aerospace days
A	yeah really?
B	this is the reason why they live in
A	oh
B	they're both married to the half-sister
A	he knew he knew the
B	he did he well he didn't
A	the husband?
B	no no he didn't know that
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	and so they would never have been
A	so someone he knew
B	my dad
A	oh that is
B	but they worked together
A	amazing
B	in in British Aerospace they worked together
A	oh they worked together
B	it's like you and me finding out that somehow
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	we've got some kind of connection you know
A	oh that's amazing
B	oh it is totally I mean if you think about all in the world it could be and it's just
A	and but yeah but are you
B	fifteen miles down the road
A	but are you thinking did my mum know this?
B	mm
A	would she have known or not?
B	I haven't got that far actually
A	maybe not maybe she just thought I don't want anything to do with them and she didn't know
B	I can't see how she would have made the link between
B	yeah
A	of the half-sister
B	because she would have taken his name
A	no
B	they were
A	no obviously they never met
B	they would have never met so
A	no that would have been weird if had they met
B	wow that would have
A	and not known
B	put the cat amongst the pigeons
A	no but they wouldn't necessarily have known that they were related would they?
B	no I wonder if they had said where in Wales are you from
A	well it might have eventually
B	and there might
A	come out
B	there might have been my mum have got and she probably would have got a sixth sense to it too I don't know she was a kind of always like that picking up on small things
A	that's what I mean
B	yeah don't
A	that's so close
B	don't get know them yeah you never know
B	bloody half-sister
A	and it was
B	exactly
A	oh
B	eaten my foot because she asked me early on she said and I just told her about how my mum died and it's very good for me to talk about it with a woman
A	yeah
B	because you know my brother and my dad
A	don't like to talk about it
B	they don't really
A	oh was it that
B	and she welled up
A	was it that short?
B	she welled up
A	yeah
B	and almost I was like oh this is interesting for somebody who doesn't know someone maybe she was just on my behalf
A	no no no no if it's your half-sister if I suddenly discovered I had a half-sister I would be instantly kind of
B	yeah
A	connected
B	connected to the whole thing but then later
A	oh so your
B	an hour and a half of chatting she said to me oh you know she said
A	mm
B	and they've known since August
A	oh
B	and he's going to start the chemo
A	oh
B	but it's already spread
A	oh
B	like it did with my mum so this is the reason why
A	oh dear
B	she asked me
A	really?
B	and I sort of said it but I wish I if I'd known I would have said it perhaps in a slightly
A	yeah
B	less
A	muted
B	detailed kind of a way yeah but erm
A	no
B	no
A	you know when you know the narrative you you've told that story about your mum so many times
B	yeah
A	and you're kind of there when you're telling it but also you're slightly disconnected about the
B	you are
A	or how strong
B	yes
A	someone else here like you tell me I'd probably burst into tears
B	yeah
A	I've never met your mum
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	because it's very powerful isn't it?
B	yeah
A	just even the idea of a month it's like
B	yeah
A	horrendous
B	yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	so any blood link like that it's and they've they're feeling it ten times stronger
B	yeah
A	than anybody else is
B	and then in the background she's got her husband who she knows
A	oh that makes it
B	who
A	even
B	and she's probably thinking about her daughter and her son
A	yeah yeah yeah yeah
B	how it is for them to know I know what
A	yeah
B	er what she means it's like you know your parents are dying like
A	yeah
B	my god you know this is
A	very emotional
B	well I wish I'd been cos well and erm and I'll definitely go back to see her and I think she's lovely and she you know she said I'm so glad that we have got to meet in our lives
A	it is true
B	that I had an opportunity to because in a way I didn't say it but I knew she was thinking it too cos I had that feeling she was thinking the same thing
A	no
B	I would have never have known
A	no
B	now I know that's terrible like to say it like that but at the same time
A	I'm just thinking we need to go I'm going to cancel the teas
B	or shall we get a takeaway? oh you're gonna cancel it okay
A	I don't know whether she'll do takeaways here
B	oh okay alright
A	can you survive without me?
B	yeah of course of course
