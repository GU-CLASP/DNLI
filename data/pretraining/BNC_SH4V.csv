A	but it it'd be the same thing again you see you buy the drink and a snack or something at the pub and chat to him about it and agree what he we're going to and then
B	yeah no yeah
A	oh yeah next one yeah
B	yeah we when we got mum had her business mum and dad had their business er it took ages to get some money from certain firms
A	mm yeah
C	bit longer
B	and Carfen the biggest firm in in
A	oh they're the worst I've heard yeah
B	they were I went up there to get the money I mean they owed us quite a lot of money at the time and er I went up there to get the money oh there's no one to sign the cheques so I said well I'm gonna sit here until someone comes and signs the cheques well they're in he isn't in today so he goes away and come back
A	he was there then?
B	course he was and in the end I did sit there and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait about four and a half hours I I waited
A	yeah
B	and er you know they were so sort of saying
A	did they have lots of customers coming in through?
B	they did and I
A	well that that's what you need to and you need to have a little string on the board I'm waiting for my cheque to be signed
C	yeah
B	yeah yeah and every
A	I haven't been paid waiting for cheque to be signed they'll soon get somebody out
C	that is the
A	yeah
B	I did tell the people that were going in you know I'm sorry I'm I'm waiting for my cheque you know they haven't paid us for over six months now
C	mm
A	mm
B	and they're supposed to be monthly paid pay every month
A	mm
B	and I did tell them and in the end they did come out with the cheque cos obviously the girl behind the
A	mm
B	and that was huge massive house so off we went and we did it asked them for the money oh we put it in the post asked them for the money again oh
A	and the firm went bust
B	and then the firm went bust
A	yeah that's it yeah
B	so what did we do? we went all the way travelled all the way down with the mixer and everything and smashed the floor completely
A	oh right
B	and left the floor there in bits
A	mm
B	inside the house and they'd gone away we never heard another thing about it but he did have a good flooring in his house we smashed it up cos it was our floor he hadn't paid for it
A	yeah true
B	yeah we never heard a thing about it
A	not much you can do if
B	no there's not much you can do
A	his company has gone bust
B	yeah but we didn't get any money you see but he didn't get the floor did he?
A	when
B	yeah
A	and a lot of it was stuff he'd had for his own house
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	mm
B	well there were some nasty nasty about I mean we we know a bloke that he did asphalting as well this er what was he called
A	mm
B	and then go bankrupt again and he did it about five times because every time he went bankrupt he gave the firm to his son and then his next son then his wife
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	and and he gave it away to them
A	so it wasn't him trading
B	it wasn't him so
A	so he wasn't a undischarged bankrupt
B	yeah
A	somebody else had bought the company
B	that's right
C	yeah but mm
B	for a pittance
A	for a pittance written the debt off
B	yeah and that's that's what he kept doing all of the time to people
C	what's that?
B	I just want a
A	I needed that kip actually
C	you must've done
B	that's why I left you alone
C	you just fall fell asleep?
A	yeah mm no he knew I was going to fall asleep so he said I'm gonna wander up about outside while you go to sleep
C	oh yeah
B	yeah
A	he could have put the telly on I can sleep next to it particularly if it had been football
B	actually football is on now
C	television
A	what?
B	football is on now there's an FA cup going on
A	oh right oh is there? are you missing it?
B	I'm not watching it am I?
C	I think I need background noise to fall asleep
A	do you?
C	you've said that to everyone
B	what?
C	I'm not the only one
B	yeah but I don't fall asleep as often as you
C	he tells everyone
A	mm does he?
C	he tells everyone
A	oh right
B	you do fall asleep is that true or not? but then she'll say
A	I do as well so
B	then she'll watch Broadchurch or whatever cos it's on TV
C	no it's not I watched it for real last week
B	or or whatever you watch on
A	but she needs to watch it again if she fell asleep during it
C	because I had to make cocoa at ten o'clock
A	oh you have to make the cocoa ah for ten o'clock
B	rubbish you didn't
A	yeah you did actually when you were playing that game you said oh cocoa
B	yeah
A	at ten o'clock you do

A	and we were still going at quarter past eleven twelve
B	yeah

A	you told us yes yes
C	mm
E	oh dear and that was
C	why not just take the wrapper off you don't need to put a sticker on it
E	well someone said you need to take it out and put in on a plate and do it up with tin foil so what I've done
A	put some icing sugar on top
E	no I just put the sticker it it says what it is you see? But it says erm something like erm sourced and supplied by brother Brian and and Toby
B	oh right

A	well that should have been your reply yeah I can see your point and also when we agreed to dress up we all dress up don't we? we expect everybody to dress up
E	I know I'll find somewhere to lay that
A	that should have been the right
B	yeah that would have been that would have been a right downer for them
A	that would shut him up
E	well I did a good one this morning at

E	no he was that side
A	was he?
E	that that is decani no hang on that's decani
A	that's cantoris that's cantoris

C	yeah
E	oh my
A	quite a
E	no look it says here Westminster Abbey candle service
A	read the top bit
E	the top bit say choristers
A	the er quite a lot of the male singers they staggered the services and St Paul's and Westminster Abbey
E	oh right yeah
A	and they would sing at the one and then dash over to the other
C	right
A	and do the other service
B	yeah well
C	mm
A	cos they didn't earn much
B	no
E	if do you know if someone had said to me that I could earn a living singing in the in abbeys I would have done it
B	yeah
E	that would have been me
A	yeah it probably would have been yeah
E	but no one ever
A	no well you went on to a specialist who told you to join the army
E	no they didn't
A	didn't they?
E	no the specialist said I should have been a photographer or a mechanical engineer
A	right and your mother said we'll be having none of that
E	no I I I could in those days all I ever knew about photographers was that you they were you saw them on the black and white television they were in a crowd holding these big cameras up
B	yeah yeah
E	and I thought I don't want to get they they didn't have fashion photography then was no such thing
B	mm
E	or anything like that there wasn't and I just didn't fancy that and I didn't fancy being drawing out stuff for engineering
B	no
E	but they probably they weren't far off it cos graphic design and spatial relationships all
B	yeah
C	mm
E	I nearly beat the record for turning blocks round to get them in the right position
A	oh right
E	I was two seconds off the all time record for that
A	oh good
E	now this'll be interesting I've got to go and
A	they did yeah
E	and we were at the front and how extraordinary it is to
B	yeah
E	and I saw him last year
B	oh yeah yeah
E	so now same age same year here there's the chapel's royal there were only half a dozen of them
A	yeah there weren't many yeah

A	mum gave it to you mum gave it to you
C	yeah
E	oh yeah
B	yeah
A	wow
E	oh well I'm still twitching with the idea that there is there is there's a main choir in at
A	and probably in the summer when they're on holiday
E	yeah yeah
C	yeah
E	and I did get er whether to do that I
A	I thought you didn't like driving to
E	I don't but you can get there by bus for free can you?
A	oh
E	so erm that's but I mean I I didn't get round to asking
C	mm
E	it is
C	mm
E	I do
B	it's too easy to sabotage you when you're singing in a choir wouldn't it? you just spray vinegar on their head
A	yeah
B	that's it yeah
E	I mean some days with poor old
A	she can't help it can she?
E	no she's really happy she's enjoying herself and
A	I'm sure
E	no you're right

C	mm
C	no we still got the
E	no no you heard the
C	yeah
E	that's on Youtube and it got out someone posted it and
C	how did they get hold of it?
E	on Youtube
C	how did he come to it?
E	well I mentioned to him that I had found it
C	yeah but someone had to put it on there
E	I don't know who put it on and then they gave them all a laugh it had so many views forty something people had looked at it
B	yeah
C	of course it was on television wasn't it?
E	huh?
C	they recorded it on television
B	yeah we did mm
E	can I have another one can I have another one please?
C	yeah

A	you could the gillet Skandi one can go on the back can't it? on the tag
C	are you still eating? sorry
E	yeah yeah I am but I'm going to stop
A	are you?
E	okay
A	er
E	there was an accident on the A1 with the bus in the thing bus and a car they've arrested the bus driver haven't they?
B	he fell asleep probably
C	oh yeah he's one of those girls
E	how can you fall asleep when you're driving a bus load of girl cheerleaders
A	when was that then?
E	a couple of days ago
C	is that the one
E	he hit a car an Aldi that was on the on the hard shoulder but if you've got a bus load of cheerleaders on their way to cheerleading you can't fall asleep can you?
A	well what was the Aldi doing on the hard shoulder?
E	well I don't know
A	and they tell you if you're on the hard shoulder
E	get out the car
A	you go over the barrier away from the car you don't sit in the car
E	yeah I know they do
C	they sat in the car did they?
E	well they must have been
A	well I don't know they might have just stopped you see or they might have been just moving off again
E	mm
A	but er it's not a good idea to stop on the motorway
E	oh it's not it's it's horrendous I would try and avoid that at all costs
A	so how do they know he fell asleep? so he's alive
E	oh I don't know he he he he's alive but I if you've got a bus full of girl cheerleaders how can he fall asleep when they're on their way to go cheerleading
C	he's yeah but how do they know he fell asleep?
E	they would have been noise
A	or were they on their way back?
E	the noise no they were on their way to cheerleading
A	well maybe doing another job before you see?
E	well I don't know
A	if he was over on his driving hours they would arrest him
E	oh he might have been
A	because that's illegal
E	yeah
A	and if he was driving believe it or not I mean when you go one the motorway all the buses all the you know the city to city buses they're all doing seventy aren't they? they're all breaking the law
B	yes they do yeah
C	they are
A	cos they're not allowed above fifty-six
C	why do they do that?
A	it's fifty-six on a motorway for a lorry or a bus
C	yeah
B	but the point is
A	or a people carrier not a people carrier
C	yeah no
A	erm a transit erm
B	yeah mini bus
A	mini bus
E	the PSP
A	but they all go they all go above fifty-six but because the cameras are not set up to catch that speed
C	oh I see
A	it's only the car drivers who get done
B	trackometers they've got a trackometer in there the little
E	tako
B	tako
A	yeah yeah
B	which
E	they don't show them
B	so when they get back to base
E	mm yeah
A	they all go they all go at seventy though
B	yeah
A	don't they?
E	yeah they do go fast yeah
C	yeah we've often well we
E	yeah
C	yeah
A	and yeah I think I'm right in saying it's fifty-six
E	I had sixty in my head but it doesn't matter it's near they're near enough I know they don't it's not supposed to be
C	have a
B	they're talking about going at eighty now
A	but they've normally got erm
E	well they have a sticker on the back saying so they might as well
B	go on put it in
E	they have a sticker on the back that says what their maximum speed is don't they?
A	no not now no
E	oh really? continental ones do
A	oh maybe yeah no I think eighty would be probably quite reasonable for cars on the motorway now with modern cars they're designed to go at that speed
E	they've still only got four bits in contact with the road
A	yeah I know but the the the bits in contact compared to a
E	is it better?
A	what cars used to be like at seventy
B	they had it on Top Gear the other day they had
A	yeah
B	a a new car you know a fairly new car
A	yeah
E	mm
B	and they'd they'd put the a barrier up the end of this er runway
A	mm
B	and they had a fairly new car say say two year old car and they had a car ten years old and they went at eighty miles an hour
A	mm mm into the barrier
B	and the car the new car stopped about thirty they had a white one where they were supposed to put the break on
A	yeah
B	and they the new car stopped about five six meters away from it the old car the older car
A	slammed into it
B	slammed straight through it
A	yeah yeah yeah
E	well with ABS I mean if you think think about it breaking is totally different now thanks dear
B	yeah
A	you know you you put your foot on the break on the old days for your drum breaks
B	yeah
A	well doesn't compare you know
C	mm
A	you know if they weren't well tuned it rolled down a hill when you parked didn't it?
B	yeah well that
A	used to have a block of wood in the boot
B	you did yeah
E	you know when they replaced my ones one the front when I had my
A	yeah
E	erm they reckon that they were the original ones
A	they probably were
E	cos you drive the way say I I I look ahead and I I try not to use my breaks cos the moment you use your breaks you're wasting fuel
A	you're right
B	one each or none? none for you
E	one each?
B	one one
E	ooh less less than that
B	yeah I'm not putting any in yours
A	oh thank you
E	thank you
E	that's lovely
C	you can you can stay there
E	okay well everyone's everyone's been everyone's been busy
C	unless you're
E	have you been out there raving this morning?
A	no
B	no we had to
A	I I
E	ah you put the game out where we finished and carried on
A	I had a snooze
E	did you?
B	yeah I went out
E	you snoozed in?
A	I snoozed in
E	I left him for a snooze I went outside to do some
A	poor old
E	mm I had to be up at seven cos otherwise I wouldn't have been there for just gone eight would I?
A	mind you Friday I did work form seven in the morning till when did I get here? eight fifteen
B	yeah you did work hard then
C	yeah gosh
E	it was a long day that was and and a rotten road to drive along
A	oh it was an awful road
E	oh I hate I hate I hate that one
A	oh you know that road?
E	yeah I know that one and the one that's when you sneak up right from seventeen to get to the A1 when you're going north that's just as bad
A	but there was the bit at
E	no no
A	to catch your lights you know and there were a lot of cars coming towards me I I couldn't see the road
E	this is
A	the only thing I had to go by was the lights coming towards me
E	yeah to see where they were
A	no street lights nothing
C	we had that in
A	but
C	yeah
A	and then I ran out of water in my windscreen washers and it was that sort of it wasn't enough rain to clean your windscreen but it was enough to mud everything up
C	yeah
A	so I fortunately there was a garage about after I ran out it was about quarter of a mile further was a garage so I got some water and
A	were they caught or
E	the erm underneath there's a ball and socket join had dropped out
A	oh right
E	and the one that was keeping going was the passenger side
A	oh yeah
E	and it was the erm
A	yeah why not? put the plates away
E	the passenger side was keeping going
C	making fish on it
B	on that one
E	and and my side was gone loose the driver's side had one loose not doing anything
B	oh I see
E	and it was lashing with rain oh right and there's there's no going round by going round the wash
A	there's nothing there is there?
E	no
A	no
E	and and I popped every
A	yeah
E	so the passenger side was still wiping so I had to look out the passenger side it's ever so difficult steering when you're looking out
A	oh yeah it is yeah
E	yeah
A	the angle's wrong isn't it?
E	yeah yeah and actually what helped me more was if I looked at my satnav it told me if I was in the middle of the road or not the satnav was more accurate than looking out at yes
A	give or take five meters
E	oh
E	that was awful and
A	well once you're committed to driving that's it you got to get with it haven't you?
E	yeah and I think I was running short of fuel as well at that stage and there's nowhere to refuel there's nothing
B	that's worrying that is
E	yeah
A	well apparently on my car you can drive from London to to Scotland without filling up
B	that's great
C	yeah
B	on ours that'll tell you how much fuel how how far you can you and what fuel you've got left
C	mm
A	so does mine
B	and when it's on the red you think ooh I've got to get some fuel and you look you look to see erm how far you can go and it says two hundred and sixty miles or something stupid like that
A	really?
B	yeah
C	really?
B	when it's on the red
C	got to check that out
E	I think this this one does will do about ninety won't it? I think when it starts on the red you've got about ninety to go on it or something funny you've got a lot or nineteen maybe it is
A	no fifty odd
E	is it?
A	I think
E	oh right doesn't it make a difference the price that fuel is now when you think well I I've put in I've put in I've always put in a
A	mm
E	and then I go put thirty pounds in and it goes up to three quarters full and not half full doesn't it? it makes a big difference from what
A	oh right yeah cos you you can get
E	we we're we're getting so I put in generally around about thirty pound
A	yeah
E	yeah cos I always
A	and then that goes half full
C	well it's not surprising
A	filling up filling up mine
E	yeah
A	it was not the Polo the people carrier
C	you put fifty pound in whereas it was sixty before wasn't it?
B	yeah it was yeah
A	er I was close on to a hundred pounds' worth when I filled it up at once stage
C	mm mm
A	cos I I always fill it
B	do you yeah?
A	if I stop at a garage I fill it
B	you might as well yeah
C	yeah
A	erm and the Polo was considerably less now yeah it was quite noticeable
C	mm mm
A	cos it was I think coming up here no when I set set off for
C	mm
B	yeah
A	which I was surprised at I would have expected it to be more
C	yeah
E	hasn't this cheesecake done well it's done a whole weekend hasn't it?
A	yeah there we are
E	brilliant
A	mm
E	is this digestive biscuit sort of mushed up
A	mm
E	mm
C	it has gone kind of cakey now
A	it has hasn't it? strange
B	it's gone cakey yeah
C	but the cream cheesy bit is lovely
A	that's soaked into it that
C	it's beautiful that top bit
A	mm
B	it's all gone now look
A	see the bottom bit should really bit crispy shouldn't it?
B	yeah crunchy
A	perhaps I should have booked the bottom first before I
B	mm
A	now I'd better get motoring
B	yeah
A	mm
C	it's gone very quick this weekend it's seems quick
B	it has gone quick yeah back to work tomorrow
A	yeah
B	yeah how many kids have we got coming?
E	I'm gonna knock this job on the head on Monday morning and if he's if he's not there to answer the phone and tell me yes I no I didn't get your email I'm yes I want you to do it he said to do it I just gave him confirmation of the sizes cos he kept changing them
B	I don't know why people say they haven't got your email but the internet it's got to work
A	that's right I was chasing a guy for information he wanted to be a centre and he said alright any progress yet and I emailed him back well you haven't sent me the courses yet that I asked you to send me
B	mm
A	and all his policy had gone in my spam folder
A	for some reason
C	we had something that keep going in the spam don't we?
A	and I think it was because he'd erm he's put them into a folder a zipped folder
B	yeah and you and that's a bit
A	I think they've put it into spam
B	that would do that would do
A	you see
B	unless it recognised the address of the sender
A	yeah so I I do check my spam now cos if we've got a er the work erm antivirus thing also monitors email because we were getting a lot of funny email you know this invoice isn't paid please send us so and so
B	yeah oh yeah
A	please send us your bank details we're trying to pay you an expense back
B	those people
A	so it cuts all those out but it you have to watch it cos it cuts out you know erm so yeah I think sometimes when people say they haven't got it they haven't had it because it's in their spam folder you may a have a record of it being delivered but they won't
E	well it did yeah well it did

E	it it gets complicated
C	well that's easy then
A	no but
E	oh I cancelled it
A	you had the option not sure or something
B	yeah yeah
A	right and you can still lodge it
E	but it was is is this card shared with anybody else and things like that well I'm thinking
A	well you answer is no no just say I told you say no to that alright because if it was it was only for a tiny month or two months or three months it's not worth arguing about and and I don't think
B	I don't think she will
E	ah no but if they find that they know it was registered to two people
A	it wasn't you told me it was on the business
E	but there there's two oh ah that card there was a card that was made for the business
A	well how many cards have you got that you owe on
E	well the other one I chucked away but yeah I have
A	that's alright then
B	your brother's trying to look after you
E	he is I know but I've been having a stressful time
A	no come on
E	I have
A	don't give me that you're off the pills now you're fine you told me
B	yeah yeah you did
C	you haven't been that why you haven't been having a stressful time
E	well I always do with the computer cos things get the one thing that frightening me now
C	you're you're not stressed
A	you've got a new computer
C	in your life
E	I have a new computer yes
C	your life isn't stressful is it?
E	pardon?
C	is it?
E	my life isn't but technology stresses me if I could just bin the whole lot and just do it with brushes and things like that I'd be happy
A	well you can once you've got all your money back from Barclays
E	yeah that's fine for the moment
B	terabyte
E	two terabyte terabyte
A	two terabytes
B	yeah
E	erm and I really ought to copy that onto I've got none of the other one the free one
A	no if you've got one you've got one that's fine
E	no but if that goes tits up
A	well how many copy backups do you need? people only have one back up
E	the I the external drive is my drive it's not on the computer I don't keep anything one the computer
A	why not?
E	I'm jolly lucky cos if it had been all on the computer I would have nothing now
A	no you have it all on the computer and you back it up on your drive that's you can set your computer up to do that automatically
B	yeah
A	it will copy everything off your computer onto your hard drive
E	well that's not the way I had it and it's a good job I didn't because
A	no but if it had been on that computer and backed up
E	yeah okay right
A	and that that's how people normally do it it's a separate hard drive that you back up on
E	I haven't finished telling you what I'm frightened of doing now
A	right go on
E	is that I've got this box I'm working off and I've got the other box that I ought to back up onto I am terrified of copying and pasting in case I lose it on the way I lose everything
A	no if you're copying it you can't lose it if you
E	are you absolutely sure I can't
A	if you do if you do delete and paste
E	there's no way it can't go wrong
B	yeah it can
A	you could
E	no but if you're copying and paste and it goes all pear shaped and jams up
A	it doesn't matter because all you're doing is copying it the original one is still there it's not moving the original it's copying the original
E	but if while it's trying to move it it mucks up
A	right if I said to you right this is exactly how it is right I'd like you to copy this on that piece of paper there are you going to lose that? No
E	I know that but is is the technology going to behave?
A	yes that's exactly how it works
B	I just think you're only making excuses
E	well I've had so much trouble with the things
B	I really do only because of your incompetence
E	well I don't know it is
B	yes mostly
C	yeah I think it's time we move
E	that's alright
A	it's time I moved probably
B	you'll have to go down and sort him out
A	what
B	you'll have to sort all those problem
A	I don't understand these computers you know
C	you can do it though
B	mm
C	you can do it
A	all these computers stress me out
C	you can
A	so Barclays card this evening fill it out put don't know if you don't know right if you can make up a reasonable guess make a guess and send it on they're never going to check they'll just be pleased to give you the money and get rid of it
C	they are a bank I mean they just want
A	they don't want anything to do with it any more it must cost them so much money sorting it
B	yeah
A	aside from the payouts they must have so many staff working on it
B	mm
C	yeah
A	nightmare but then they shouldn't have been naughty should they? naughty bankers
C	how did they start it off then? saying this was illegal to have dine
A	well it's just one of those things somebody somebody tried to make a claim
B	yeah
A	and they've said well you're self-employed you you don't get anything and then they phoned up money box and there we are saying look I've paying this money in for the last five years I've been ill erm and they're not paying me anything cos I'm self-employed but they never told me that
C	they were covering mortgages mainly weren't they?
E	oh they were they were all in insurance policies and things they probably you didn't know you were paying it some of the people cos
A	oh that's right yeah
E	I was sold it when erm actually just before I moved up here I think and I remember I made a phone call to I was I think I was try I had to put I needed to make one payment and there wasn't enough I didn't have a big enough allowance on one card so you can put two cards together for a short period
A	yeah
E	you see so you can amalgamate the allowance from one card to another so you can make that payment in one payment it was buying the house
E	probably it's to do with buying the house it was and so I erm when I phoned up to do that you get a call
A	mm
E	and the lady said while you're on the phone erm would you like erm an insurance erm that if you can't work we'll pay off your balance? and I said well how much is it going to cost and she said it won't cost you anything if you don't owe us anything well I didn't owe them anything
A	mm
E	when I did that but then they don't tell you what you're going to have to pay if you do owe something
A	okay right
E	that's the problem but she didn't
A	that's where they made the mistake
E	that's their big mistake and it was just while I was phoning about another thing I was sold it
A	mm
E	and
A	and they were
C	yeah
E	that's fine that's fine it's not going to cost anything erm it's not going to cost anything I may as well have it
A	yeah yeah
E	which anybody would wouldn't they?
A	yeah
E	but there's no such thing as a free
C	we don't get insurance things for anything anyway I think if it goes you know er goods we don't pay
A	I don't tend to I sometimes think about it erm but
C	think about it but usually
A	invariably I think well okay the hoover will probably last three years anyway I played sixty quid for it well twenty quid a year for a hoover I don't want to pay another forty pound to insure it
E	no no
A	and then it goes bust a month after the three years is up
C	mm
E	yeah
A	and anyway they they cover it for the first three years but the first year's covered anyway
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	so it's only two years you're paying for
C	and then you usually want a new one anyway if it does go completely
A	right there's your notes
C	right okay
B	you got your bit now
C	a big party at
A	hello
C	big party
E	eighteenth of July
A	as l long as I remember it's there I have done so far

C	yeah I know
A	he's not listening
C	no he's listening
E	that's

E	and they moved them around to make them the congregation wherever they were filming
A	and it was down the west Great West Hall wannit?
E	this was at the Great West Hall and they put a Christmas tree up in the middle of summer for the
C	they do that don't they?
E	yeah that is
A	but I I came along as part of the congregation I wasn't there then but I remember it cos I was I was there with mum
C	were you?
A	yeah
E	and I had this most when when we did that I had to sing the first verse of the Holly and the Ivy on my own and I it was awful cos they they they filmed it no they played the the
A	oh you did did that yeah
E	and then when they and then before they filmed it they put chalk marks round all our feet so that if we had a break through the filming we could come back and put our feet back in the same
A	quite clever
E	clever?
C	yeah
E	nightmare I still don't like cameras pointed at me I really don't like it yeah
