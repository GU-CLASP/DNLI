A	what are you making?
B	well I was thinking about making a little hat
A	yeah
B	the problem with me is that
A	such as that one? Yeah it looks very stripy and complicated
B	I don't really like the pointy bit on the end of that though I think it looks a bit stupid
A	like like a  like a  pixie or something
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	but the problem is like I
A	uh yeah I can see some one with ones with a point and I can see some ones with obviously the flat bit at the end
B	so like those ones
A	yeah
B	so you can get like a gage but I haven't got one where you can put your needle in and it tells you what size you're knitting on
A	that's the
B	but I haven't got one yet so I just try and find ones that look about right
A	yeah
B	like this one says use three and three quarter
A	well if this is six point six then
B	yeah I know
A	oh
B	it's like you can't tell
A	you can actually
B	I need one of those what are they called? Me dad's got one like um
A	not not a
B	no it's like a pincer thing do you know what I mean?
A	oh those things yeah
B	it's like for measuring really small
A	but um
B	um
A	yeah
B	be pretty hard though
A	be a bit  be a bit be a bit  annoying
B	just to see like a quarter of a millimetre
A	yeah you'd have to be very uh
B	three and a quarter millimetres versus three and a half
A	you'd have to hold it very
B	and I just sort of tend to start and then just see like is it does it look right? That's why the things always come out a tiny bit different to how they look in the picture
A	yeah
B	and I never buy the right wool like you're supposed to knit it in like really
A	yeah all
B	all different like
A	you
B	so I was thinking about knitting a little hat so I've done booties and a jumper
A	um yeah
B	yeah
A	you've done boots and you've got a hat
B	but
A	then you need some trousers
B	there's a
A	yeah
B	like if it's a boy they're not gonna like
A	yeah
B	but like
A	there's a pink uh
B	can you see like the details? It's all pink and like ribbons and
A	yeah that's got a lot of  lot of  bits hasn't it?
B	if it's a little boy he's not gonna be
A	um
B	so I'm just sticking to like bright colours for now anyway
A	unless they were short of clothes
B	well yeah but
B	and that's so like that's another thing
A	yeah
B	but it's alright
A	works with both doesn't it? Yeah
B	there's some really good stuff like I
A	oh right
B	punk like little so like you know those little booties that I knitted?
A	yeah
B	I saw a pattern for like Doctor Marten like knit little
A	yeah
B	so if you have like a punk baby
A	yeah
B	that would be pretty cool
B	I think
A	yeah
B	I mean like my family knit a lot like that's why I knit
A	yeah
B	but I don't know about other people
A	Cos it's popular
B	I mean some people think it's chavvy
A	yeah
B	some people
A	but
B	like those lazy socks as well do you know those?
A	wouldn't wouldn't a sort of peasant baby be less likely to have uh like
A	alright
B	those socks on you know those socks those really frilly socks with loads of lace?
A	um
B	like that was really chavvy or like
A	really?
B	yeah I mean just a bit over the top
A	uh
B	maybe you need to
A	or
B	no well I don't think so but I think it depends
A	yeah
B	I think like anything could look chavvy though couldn't it really?
A	not things that are sort of frumpy uh so much
B	well
B	do you think boys wear?
A	if you're talking chavvy is it talking chavvy meaning poor or if you're talking chavvy meaning um uh garish
B	do you think boys wear hats? I mean
A	um
B	do you think it's suitably like unisex?
A	Cos
B	yeah
A	I mean  I mean  they people aren't always that choosy about what they put on a baby are they? Or are or some of them might be I mean
B	I don't know
A	yeah well I think
B	but someone was telling me
A	oh yeah is that sort of something like I think it was QI was it or was it?
B	was it you telling me that?
A	uh where they said that yeah it used to be men
B	yeah
A	and then blue uh more feminine in uh Victorian times according to think it was QI
B	uh-huh
A	um which is surprising for a lot of people now
B	yeah
A	uh urban myths or uh commonly held misconceptions or whatever that um that uh that's the point of QI but uh
B	it'd be good to be a researcher wouldn't it?
A	yeah I mean I I don't really understand how they why they always have fixed colours for for different you know things but
B	no
A	I I think everyone should wear every colour but  that's just  that's just me
B	yeah but I mean
A	there's a lot of  there's a lot of  crazy possibilities I suppose
B	I like the brightly coloured things like the jazzy stuff but I mean I don't know if
A	yeah I guess they um they have loads and loads of
B	yeah
A	so um
B	I don't know everyone likes a bit costume change Lady Gaga style
A	yeah I don't know much about Lady Gaga really
B	I don't
A	like she wore meat meat one time didn't she?
B	just that she's weird
A	uh very strange sort of haircuts and things
B	I think like
A	really sort of
B	well
A	well it's a good sort of she sort of blend of uh Madonna type image with um
B	oh there's definitely a lot of Madonna in there
A	with a sort of Marylin Manson type image or something
B	oh yeah
A	or something strange uh that I don't really
B	I don't really follow her I don't really know
A	Don't understand that but
B	if she's been on like Jonathan Ross or something
A	oh yeah
B	one of them shows
A	yeah I've been uh
B	Friday is it not on on the?
A	like Friday it is it's on sort of late at late on Friday
B	yeah
A	um so I think I watched last the last one repeated last Friday
B	yeah
A	um
B	he's weird like have you seen
A	oh yeah it's it's called uh
B	that's right yeah
A	uh
B	did
B	yeah he was really good he was the best
A	they they definitely had a good they got they had a good sort of dynamic together
B	yeah
A	uh but but also the one they had others there um
B	well there's the guy who plays
A	there's the the gorilla
B	gorilla
A	yeah his name's something something brown or something
B	or the bear
A	and then there's
B	he's called Matt as well isn't he?
A	I don't know
B	I think so
A	and uh there's um and then there was uh Brian
B	oh yeah
A	uh and he's uh I I last saw him on an advert on an obscure advert
B	he's been on a few things
A	and
B	oh yeah
A	yeah
B	I don't know
A	composition or something
B	I suppose we'll have to see like this new one and see how much music's in it and stuff and like if it's all just like spangly one pieces and like cakes and that
A	yeah
B	Cos what's that uh?
A	some of the strange voices that he does the
B	yeah
A	events um
B	they have some good characters like do you remember that one that was just a head? And he was like
A	just a hedge?
B	and he was
A	head
B	he's like I've got a crate of poppers
A	you mean Tony Harrison?
B	Tony Harrison
A	he's uh he's a sort of uh pink head with no hair and little sort of octopus tentacles coming at the bottom but
B	yeah that was pretty weird
A	and they and they travelled around on a carpet a lot
B	that's right the other wizards yeah
A	the brother uh Noel Fielding's brother was was a wizard or something called Naboo or something
B	that's right yeah
A	and uh
B	do you think they'll make another series of that?
A	um
B	Cos they did like a stage show
A	Julian Barratt's um Julian Barratt's obviously busy with something else maybe maybe he's got a family or something
B	uh they've got like a
A	yeah that was  that was  really good um we had that DVD but it disappeared uh
B	I wonder where it's gone
A	um it's it's in  it's in
B	uh-huh
A	I don't know if you know
B	it's probably lost forever now
A	it's just
B	I'm not sure
A	I would've
B	I've got the box
A	we
B	that belonged to
A	I thought that that that the
B	maybe it is
A	um
B	I know but
A	there was a chance that it might've got lent to your brother
B	I don't know
A	but I don't know if it was ever taken out of your parents' house
B	yeah
A	in in um your parents' house but
B	oh I don't know
A	but but if we did get that that was  that was  a good video but uh
B	could probably download it from somewhere
A	um
B	the filmed one?
A	yeah
B	although I liked  I liked  like Tundra and um there were some really good episodes like that Wild West one
A	yeah I think there was
B	beta Max
A	um yeah yeah some of the episodes are very good uh uh I think there was what was it? There was the first
B	oh yeah where they they had like The Emporium
A	the third series they had a shop
B	where was the second series?
A	in a  in a
B	oh yeah yeah they had like a
A	uh where they lived with uh you know Noel and Julian lived with the gorilla and the uh
B	his brother
A	brother and and they uh they
B	yeah
A	uh
B	I'd totally forgotten about that until the other day
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	but
B	oh yeah and they like
A	and then there's
B	they sort of
A	some of them and then often they're good at  good at  music
B	oh Black Lake
A	and then they uh
B	when he's like have you ever drank Baileys from a shoe?
A	and they they go down the sort of they go fishing in the lake in the middle of the night and the
A	there's a lot
B	the
A	yeah and then then they go out onto the lake to look for the um big black monster or something this big
A	sea that lives under the uh sorry monster that lives under the sea and then
A	he gets dragged to its lair
A	what was the name of the? I don't know
B	falls in love with
A	it falls in love with Noel or the other way round
B	no no no the
A	it falls in love with with uh Julian
B	yeah
A	his name was
B	oh yeah
A	he his Julian's name was Vince Noir and then um
B	I don't know I haven't see it for so long
A	um so they they get dragged to the
B	oh yeah
A	that's probably the best song that that they've
B	uh oh I forgot about that
A	uh that that they did from that
B	yeah there was a few I
A	but I like like that was one of my favourite comedy programmes and also I like Peep Show as well
B	yeah
A	but uh
B	do you think they'll do another series of that?
A	yeah so
B	I know
A	what?
B	like sorry is it finished though?
A	peep Show? Peep Show?
B	or do you think they'll like?
A	peep Show will probably  probably keep going for a  probably keep going for a few more wouldn't wouldn't it or?
B	Don't know
A	wouldn't they sort of? Cos I I imagine that um
B	yeah
A	uh they they they doing
B	although he's in everything now isn't he that David Mitchell?
A	they've done
B	in fact when does that thing start?
B	when does that new you know with Lauren Laverne when does that start again?
A	he he he'd definitely  he'd definitely  say yes I think he just wants to keep doing stuff
B	is he really going out with Victoria Coren?
A	well
B	is that a rumour?
A	but well I no I thought it was really really plausible because I thought the two of them were so similar like to the point of
B	did you read that? Yeah
A	they almost like
B	well he's a bit funny like I mean he's not my cup of tea
A	he's a bit funny
B	no not ha ha funny
A	or ooh funny
B	like ugh like he's a bit sort of
A	yeah
B	like he would get on you nerves
B	but do you not think?
A	an authoritative barrister
B	yeah but
B	you don't  you don't  want Clive Anderson?
A	after a hard day at work come home and you'd be like ooh I'm really tired
A	ah
B	might be though
A	I think he performs really
B	yeah
A	cross
B	yeah yeah uh examining cross examine them
A	yeah
B	what?
A	socratic
B	what does that mean?
A	I don't know I just
B	oh
A	no uh I remember Boris Johnson said it said it once
B	oh well he probably just made it up then
A	uh it's just it's something it's the sort of expression you'd know if you if you've come gone to the kind of school that Boris Johnson went to I'd imagine
B	yeah
A	uh
B	did Boris Johnson go to Eton then?
A	um I think so cos there was a programme about him with at the Bullingdon Club wasn't there with um
B	so you can only be in the Bullingdon Club if you go to Eton then?
A	um
B	no but I mean like you obviously had to
A	is the Bullingdon Club located in? Where is it?
B	it's at the University yeah but you must've have to have some pedigree to go to get in
A	in Oxford
B	yeah
A	A lot of them those sort of comedians that actually may've been barristers if it wasn't for the opportunities these days there's a big market for comedians stand-up comedians
B	yeah
A	um
B	tomfoolery
B	there's so many of them panely games on
B	yeah
A	then then there was Shooting Stars
B	yeah
A	in the mid nineties
B	but they scrapped that that's shocking isn't it?
A	well
B	yeah but it was good like
A	I think
B	think it was just the same stuff?
A	it had done  it had done  enough of it like I'd rather see more from Reeves and Mortimer
B	like do sketch shows or something or?
A	well they've done a few different sketch shows
B	yeah
A	uh
B	yeah
A	uh
B	me dad  me dad  really likes that sort of thing
A	then they did a few things like Randall And Hopkirk Deceased and
B	oh yeah
A	that that one that was kind of like Phoenix Nights but before Phoenix Nights
B	oh Baron's Baron's Nightclub
A	uh
B	yeah you can't  you can't  like accuse one of just copying a nightclub of having a
A	I think it was the format of it being sort of um
B	or like
A	it's not a mockumentary it's a mockudrama or something like uh spoof
B	yeah
A	spoof comedy but staged as a drama so that sort of  sort of  a bit like
B	yeah
A	Cos that
B	oh
A	spoof
B	got
A	well yeah Borat took took that sort of cringe to the  to the
B	oh it was so bad
A	um
B	think I've made a
A	have you made a mistake with your knitting then?
B	I think so
A	so is it hard to talk and knit at the same time?
B	no not not really
A	because but you started it so you're doing a technical procedure aren't you?
B	I I just
A	yeah
B	no
A	yeah
B	but you know
A	accident yeah but so
B	sorry please carry on
A	so what you got? Cool Knits For Kids what was that? But um
B	yeah
A	yeah so we were
B	you were saying that Alan Partridge was your favourite
A	well
B	yeah
A	uh
B	oh it was so bad I honestly thought like I would've just
A	for Borat? Some of it's hard
B	about that bit when he like
A	I think it did go
B	I think because it
A	you know
B	like people prosecuted him and
A	yeah he
B	all kinds of things
A	there were  there were  people getting sacked for for having him um
B	yeah
A	uh for having him do
