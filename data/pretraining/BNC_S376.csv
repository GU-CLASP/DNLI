C	I mean you printed what did you print today?
B	I printed about a hundred and seventy pages today
C	did you do that on my account?
B	no my account
A	I've probably printed about ten pages all year maybe I don't even think I've I've spent a quid
C	at the beginning at the end of last year just to use up my allowance I put about a hundred quid in
A	I don't know what
C	and it's gone
A	I don't know cos I don't have anything to
C	I've got reports and cases to read
B	journal articles
A	I just read everything online
C	I can't
B	that's probably why
A	yeah I don't
C	I like to annotate it highlight it write in the margin
A	sometimes I have an issue with not being able to yeah sometimes that bothers me but like I printed
B	like even even an essay I will probably print out seven times proofread it go over it and go over it and go over it
C	I really like this film
A	I wanted to watch that mm
C	it's really really good
B	no he got nominated didn't win it
A	no er I saw the I saw the picture like the poster in some in
B	it's just the thing he's just like erm the camera went up to him afterwards and he was just like oh piss off
A	really?
B	acting like a he was he was only joking
A	oh right
B	but er yeah acting pretty pissed
A	Benedict Cumberbatch
B	yeah it's alright
C	it's Hunger Games-esque so if you like The Hunger Games watch it if not don't
B	I don't think it's that it's like that but
C	if you're into that kind of stuff
B	oh yeah
C	watch it if not don't
A	I might get involved at the weekend actually
B	it's worth a watch it's alright it's not bad at all
A	yeah I might get involved mate I might get involved
B	nice mate nice
C	when does Alzheimer's generally strike? like sevent eighties?
B	yeah
A	three hundred and fifty million viewers
C	I saw that thirty different countries
B	and then what was it? fifty million pound a year for the BBC bearing in mind they don't advertise so
A	mm
B	that's a lot of money although I saw we have a TV licence letter downstairs
A	oh really have we?
B	yeah so I don't know what we do with that?
C	as long as we don't watch live TV we're good
A	it's always TV's always on downstairs
B	is it?
A	yes
B	I don't fucking watch it
C	but generally we we only watch Netflix so and
B	yeah you
C	you do
B	but
C	twenty quid
B	between us for the year
C	I'm not getting it this year
A	yeah but what's the point in paying it for? I watch it I wouldn't it wouldn't be a loss to my life if I stopped watching it but
B	yeah
C	from now until September
B	but the other thing is they don't know the only thing is is that the living room TV is connected to an aerial and if they come in they'll go you've obviously been watching TV
A	mm
B	so that's
A	you're allowed to you're allowed to tell them no once aren't you? and then if they come back with a warrant
C	yeah cos I said no last year and then we paid it
B	yeah we paid it before he came back round
A	yeah
B	but you can stream and stuff but you can just put the laptop on or an Xbox or whatever
A	yeah you see I think watching is just the ease of I
C	eat we eat in here generally don't we?
A	yeah I like eating either either in the kitchen or in there
C	I I never watch live TV
B	yeah you don't need it if you stream like BBC Iplayer or
A	mm a lot of the time I think though
C	I sit and watch I sit while we've been watching on demand I miss live TV I like to flip through the channels
A	mm
C	sometimes you
A	yeah I think when I just end up streaming everything or like net if we're on Netflix or whatever there's there's an odd feeling about it like it's just unlimited like I could just be sat here all day whereas yeah I don't feel like that with TV
B	yeah it's too much it's too much really
C	I was reading on erm ten ways recently erm if you've got Sky broadband if you ring them up and say you wanna cancel
A	mm
C	they say why? and I think the person said oh I've found a better offer with Virgin or something and they're like oh we'll match it and he said oh I want to cancel anyway cos I get a voucher when I join with them and they said we'll give you twelve months free
A	fucking hell
C	twelve months that's a massive
A	mum's on the verge of signing well mum and dad are on the verge of signing up to Sky broadband
B	see it's shit where I am and no one has it
C	it's great where I am
A	we're we're on AOL and we're supposed to be getting eight megabytes like we get sixty here don't we?
B	a hundred and twenty
A	oh did we up it?
B	yeah
A	yeah well yeah we were supposed to get an eight and we were getting one point four or something like that it's essentially fucking dial-up
C	we were on IO AOL with dial-up I used to love the noise
A	it's ridiculous it's so
B	I I have no signal
A	I warned you bruv
B	it's a fucking shambles
C	I thought you said my house my house is fine for signal the one thing with dial-up that used to piss me off is I used to play online gaming and then mum'd be like oh I'm going to call nan now so they put the phone back in and I'm like no no
A	mm
B	I've never ever had a problem with internet
A	genuinely fallen out with dad about it at times like
B	get it fixed
A	I don't really have that problem I had it last night before I went to bed and I was like well that was only really with my Xbox for some reason and then it came back and I was like well I'm going to sleep anyway
B	that's the thing like he moans about it but look how far away we are from the box
A	yeah
B	and there are at least twenty-one things hooked up to that thing
A	so much innit?
C	I said to you I was downstairs in the living room and it wasn't connecting
A	I never have a problem with it really
B	me neither like cos
A	mm
C	that's the good thing about next year there's gonna be less of us less devices
A	yeah still get the same kind of deal or a similar deal
B	yeah
A	and have shit hot internet
B	just less people to divide the bills by is what that means
A	true but that's what we get a job for
C	let's take a look at the energy rating in
A	that's fair that's fair enough
B	yeah
C	that's it if we get up late and someone starts like cleaning and washing up we're screwed but it's our own fault for getting up late
A	yeah your time your your times screw you over
B	yeah but to honest with you it only it happened to me the first time today since I've been back
A	mm
B	and I've been back a a week tomorrow I think
A	he's always fucking shouting
B	he just needs to get on with it like
A	just move the shower out the way and
B	yeah exactly
A	wait
B	you do that though
B	that's what he does and he's like ah it's like fucking move it then
A	yeah it's not like it
B	oh it's really hot it's burning me
A	take it off you
C	oh cos it takes ages I just want to get clean
B	it is literally moving the shower head
C	yeah but you've got to wait and you get cold
B	or you can burn
A	or you burn or you get frozen
B	that that's what I hate
C	I can embrace the cold
B	I can't handle that cold I cannot handle
A	I just yeah I get frustrated but
C	your body numbs after a while and you can't feel it
A	yeah but I don't want my body to numb
B	exactly like and when it gets hot again you you just have to itch and stuff
A	I just I just put it off me
B	yeah exactly a simple thing to do even in Barbados that shower was cold and it was hot I fucking hated it I was so relieved when I
A	mm
B	have a nice hot shower
A	mm
C	mm

B	you can flush the toilet you can
C	the worst thing they had for a year was over Christmas when everyone went home and I was here for work and
A	yeah it's not it's not great to be honest I think we we had we've got it at home where
B	oh like a dribble
A	so yeah it comes out a dribble and it's really hot and it'll go stronger if you put it round down to the cold but yeah it's
C	and when the pressure is right it's freezing cold
A	yeah it's fucking minging but he's got it sorted now cos
B	I I the worst I had here was the downstairs toilet wouldn't stop flushing
