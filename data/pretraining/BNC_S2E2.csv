A	hello
B	and I'm
A	and we're careers consultants here at um the university
B	yeah
B	I would agree
B	at the end of the day they are the number one query if we had to kind of
A	mm
B	mm
A	and infographic CVs and and so on
B	mm
A	and er who they are
B	mm
A	from just a check-list of little things they've done
B	yeah
A	mm
B	about having to do that
A	mm
B	for all the changes to recruitment CVs are still predominantly
A	mm
B	asked
A	mm
B	by a lot of the major sectors
A	mm
B	so people are still
A	mm
B	unsure of how to phrase them and what people
A	mm
B	look for
A	mm
B	and that's when we say there's so many wide and varied occupations
A	mm
B	look for the opportunities
A	mm
B	and then tailor
A	mm
B	your CV
A	mm
B	and
A	mm
B	and the questions people have
A	mm
B	and then just say what kind of work can I go for?
A	mm
B	so as a starting point it's the other way round
A	mm
B	you know
A	mm
B	in terms of your career planning?
A	mm
B	and then
A	mhm
B	produce a CV to match that
A	so Tahira do you think that people should always have an up-to-date CV?
B	yeah
A	and have you got an up-to-date CV?
B	this it's funny you should ask me that actually
A	and what does your CV look like? What kind of headings do you have on your CV?
B	my CV has a personal profile
A	okay
B	what about you
B	Fiona? It's an interesting one isn't it?
B	er to ask a careers adviser
A	it is  it is  Um
B	mm
A	and summary of who I am together with what it is that I'm seeking
B	oh that's er interesting
A	so I've got that next on my CV
B	mm
A	and then I've got um in reverse chronological order my employment
B	mm
A	um
B	mm
A	responsibilities and
B	mm
A	are
B	ah
A	and even though I've been working now for quite a long time over twenty years really I'd still probably try to get my CV on two pages
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	Cos I think that's the other thing it's how long should a CV be?
A	yeah
B	and then I always sort of say well who's it aimed at?
A	mhm
B	and what type of opportunity?
A	mm
B	so what would you say for a part-time CV? How long? Part-time job CV
A	um
B	mm
A	not worked very much and you've only got GCSEs or A-Levels then probably a page is long enough
B	yeah
A	um
B	mm
A	um
B	yes
A	you know nicely laid out and spaced out
B	yeah
A	it's not supposed to be like a comprehensive document of absolutely everything you've done
B	er it's interesting about cultural differences as well though isn't it
A	yeah
B	I think er from what I see from a lot of international students is the the er the information of of mm you know wanting to put more information on
A	mm
B	so obviously the
A	mm
B	I've seen a lot of CVs where they run
A	mm
B	to three or four
A	mm
B	pages
A	mm
B	I don't know
A	mm
B	pages you've seen
A	mm
B	for the most
A	mm
B	um
A	mm
B	see
A	mm
B	your health
A	mm
B	and whether you're a smoker or a
A	mm
B	non-smoker
A	mm
B	your marital status
A	mm
B	which I know we've not seen for a number of years
A	mm
B	um
A	mm
B	the truth
A	mm
B	and I think there are a lot to be said in
A	mm
B	terms of cultural differences in the
A	mm
B	photos
A	that's right  that's right  Yeah
B	yeah
A	and I was a bit surprised really cos I thought well well kind of because you want the employer to contact you
B	yeah
A	so it's quite
B	mm
A	it's a reasonable point
B	yeah
A	on a CV really
B	I would agree with you
A	yeah
B	and the opportunity
A	yeah
B	but as we know if it's a council on the
A	mm
B	thing they accept
A	mm
B	you might be sent an application form
A	mm
B	or you might be sent additional
A	mm
B	literature
A	mm
B	things that they need to
A	mm
B	to cover
A	um
B	mm
A	to contact you
B	yeah
A	um
B	mm
A	so I I would be fairly um relaxed about kind of contact details
B	yeah
A	what about you
B	you see I I kind of take a different view
A	do you? Okay
B	I I do say make it easy for the employer
A	mm
B	and same for students
A	mm
B	accommodation and you're worried about your mail then have it to a secure address
A	mm
B	whether it's your
A	mm
B	family or somebody else
A	yeah
B	then then
A	mm
B	do it that way
A	mm
B	be able to access
A	mm
B	every day
A	mm
B	final years
A	mm
B	you know
A	mm
B	months
A	mm
B	and by the time the employer's got back in touch with you
A	mm
B	you might have already have left the university
A	mm
B	and not have
A	mm
B	access to e-mails
A	mm
B	so mm set up
A	yeah
B	a professional e-mail account
A	mm
B	and they can contact you
A	so
B	I think my take ideally you should have both
A	mm
B	cV
A	mm
B	if you like is to I mean again if you've been working for a number of years it's useful to start with your work history
A	mm
B	and just as you've done summarize your key skills but have a separate key skills section
A	mm
B	um
A	mm
B	it's probably better to start off with your education and
A	mm
B	work history
A	mm
B	and then your skills section
A	mm
B	do need
A	mm
B	to include a skills section
A	mm
B	hear from employers
A	mm
B	is lack of self-awareness
A	but do you not think that it's better to interweave your skills into your um achievements or your jobs? Rather than having a separate skills section
B	yeah
A	mm
B	obviously you want to highlight
A	mm
B	mm er the I think one of the things that really also I find frustrating on CVs is when you know people have copied and pasted the same job duties for like three or four different job roles
A	mm
B	and as an employer you would guess okay well they've not
A	mm
B	really pushed themselves
A	mm
B	different responsibilities
A	mm
B	and I think you can show that
A	mm
B	you know
A	mm
B	but then also have a skills section
A	mm
B	where you know the employer values business awareness
A	mm
B	or values communication
A	mm
B	or interpersonal skills
A	mm
B	because you know er you might want to kind of make sure that they're highlighted for those two or three competencies that they're seeking
A	okay
B	mm
A	and um do you put your date of birth on your CV?
B	yeah
A	mm
B	I mean it might be recruitment agencies that
A	mm
B	actually ask you for that detail
A	mm
B	social work
A	mm
B	or teaching opportunities
A	mm
B	situations where it's a necessity
A	mm
B	for you to put your date of birth
A	mm
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	see that's a hot potato isn't it
A	absolutely
B	and will you get consensus at the end of it?
A	mm
B	um
A	mm
B	so I do believe there will be elements of that that will already make an
A	mm
B	employer
A	mm
B	question whether you're a British student
A	mm
B	or international
A	mhm
B	in which case if they're already asking those questions by you putting in your status or your rights to work
A	mm
B	your visa status
A	mm
B	you can make it much clearer
A	mm
B	for an employer
A	mm
B	so my personal take is yes put it on there
A	mm
B	but I know others
A	mm
B	what do you feel?
A	yeah
B	mm
A	um as a student
B	exactly
A	employing international um people really
B	mm
A	so it's pragmatic
B	mhm
A	unless I was applying for like er potentially a job um
B	mm
A	um
B	yeah
A	there was a discussion
B	ah
A	there was a discussion er on the LinkedIn UK HE careers professionals LinkedIn group
B	mm
A	your own sales document
B	yeah
A	um
B	yeah
A	that might be applying
B	it is
A	mm
B	in front of that recruiter
A	mm
B	or that indeed they're looking at it at first thing in the morning when they're sort of likely to be awake
A	mm
B	it might be something that they've sort of
A	mm
B	had made time for at six o'clock er in the evening once the rest of the day's gone by
A	mm
B	so how do you make your CV number thirty-nine
A	mm
B	stand out in a pile of sixty
A	mm
B	and then you we all know that CVs have
A	mm
B	set information
A	mm
B	it might be your social media
A	mm
B	worthwhile including that
A	mm
B	on there
A	mm
B	you know
A	mm
B	your language skills
A	mm
B	or that are gonna be useful
A	mm
B	for that employer
A	mm
B	to know
A	mm
B	you know it's it's useful to put on there
A	mm
B	professional associations
A	mm
B	beyond what would be expected of you on a day-to-day basis
A	mm
B	dunno how you
A	mm
B	what you feel about that?
A	mm
B	or even social media
A	yeah
B	what about infographic CVs? What do you think about them?
A	um
B	mm
A	fairly plain simple presentation
B	yeah
A	um
B	mm
A	things
B	mm
A	maybe less in some industries than others
B	it's visibility I think isn't it
A	yeah
B	that you can put on there
A	linkedIn CV
B	yeah
A	details to convert into an infographic CV
B	mm
A	and I did do that
B	mm
A	but it was really more just a bar chart of
B	mm
A	how many years I'd worked in different places and things like that
B	no
A	yeah
B	isn't it
A	mm
B	for the industry that you're
A	mm
B	going into
A	mm
B	so for
A	mm
B	things like medicine would it
A	mm
B	compared to an advertising
A	mm
B	career or a
A	yeah
B	graphic design career
A	mm
B	so again it really goes back to know your employer
A	mm
B	do your research
A	mm
B	what's expected of them
A	mm
B	they usually have a name and contact
A	mm
B	number
A	mm
B	somebody in HR or somebody who's responsible for recruitment
A	mm
B	if you're not sure call them
A	mm
B	and ask
A	mm
B	you know
A	mm
B	that they're expecting? What would they like to see covered?
A	mm
B	and then have that determine your CV as well
A	mm
B	mm
A	if a
B	mm
A	um
B	I would possibly send a cover letter
A	yeah
B	I mean even if it's a small to medium size enterprise
A	mm
B	and you're
A	mm
B	thinking
A	mm
B	they're not gonna have many opportunities
A	mm
B	I think it's good practice and a courtesy
A	mm
B	to the closing date you know er there's
A	mm
B	so much that they could be doing
A	mm
B	that it's just worthwhile as a courtesy to kind of explain a little bit more
A	mm
B	and your suitability
A	mm
B	for the
A	mm
B	role you're
A	mm
B	applying for
A	mm
B	what do you feel?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	you know
B	mm
A	and I completely I would er completely um agree huh with that
B	mm
A	actually
B	er yeah
A	when in actual fact yes you can tailor it a bit
B	mm
A	but the er the real tailoring can
B	yeah
A	um that goes with it really so
B	no I agree
A	mm
B	because the letter's when you can actually write down why you're interested in that particular
A	yeah
B	employer
A	yeah
B	and how your skill set matches
A	yeah
B	what they're looking for
A	mm
B	whereas your CV is to showcase the skills that you feel you've got
A	mm
B	your skills and experience
A	mm
B	and also er any other things like your technical skills and your
A	mm
B	of the job role
A	mm
B	that you're seeking
A	mm
B	so yeah
A	mm
B	so it's it's kind of er it's finding the right kind of marriage
A	mm
B	between the two
A	mm
B	really isn't it
A	yeah
B	probably bored them with CVs
A	yes
A	let's stop
