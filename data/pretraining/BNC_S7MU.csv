A	well I had quite a busy week last week so hopefully it'll be quieter but um I've got a few things I've carried over from last week to do so
A	those those bowls are really like sonorant aren't they like a few times in the morning I've tried to get one out of the um cupboard and it's been like boong and I've thought oh that'll wake you up
B	that's a nice sound that is
A	well it's alright I mean
B	like church bells
A	oh yeah
B	they're they're a right racket aren't they?

A	oh the rest of her text messaging might've come I'll come I'll go and check
B	it'll be exciting
A	no it hasn't
A	no just half of it
B	I think horseradish is a bit underused like
A	it's nice with salmon and stuff isn't it like with fish
B	oh yeah
A	um what we having for tea tomorrow?
B	we've got  we've got  salmon as well and I've just thrown the horseradish away

B	yeah we'll have  we'll have  that then tomorrow like
A	yeah sorry
A	there you go
A	okay
B	uh yeah
A	okay it says Hi
B	as long as there's nothing embarrassing in there
A	we've
A	I suppose Sunday is the day for getting in touch with family
B	is it?
A	no I mean like our
B	easter is a possible opportunity
A	sorry?
B	easter's a possible opportunity
A	what d'you mean?
B	festivals innit? You can get together with your family at Easter
A	you mean you want to or?
B	you can I mean
A	ah it'll be fine
B	sort of solidified hasn't it? Yolk is very uh very sort of thick isn't it? When it hardens it doesn't sort of
A	yeah
B	like um quite quite a pain to get off
A	well
B	if they'd like smashed an egg and like it would take masses of effort to clean it off
A	yeah no I mean it wasn't um
B	yeah yeah yeah there was just threw it yeah
A	if you'd trashed your kitchen and you'd thrown eggs everywhere
B	yeah
A	like there was one guy who'd thrown eggs everywhere and they'd got all in like the fire um what's it called you know the
B	oh right
A	they'd had like a big fight and he'd like thrown like eggs everywhere and they'd got in there
B	yeah
A	and like
B	yeah
A	so that was like you know some amount of money to do that
B	yeah
A	but if you're gonna get drunk and chuck eggs around then that's what you get really
B	yeah I mean that's kind of the problem with uh with like
A	well
B	it it makes it harder to justify uh funding it through the state
A	well even if it is a big party like people have different ideas about
B	yeah
A	like
B	yeah a lot  a lot  of the youth of today
A	well a bit but that's why I like you
B	you know
A	no but even if I was really you know had had loads of beer or whatever I don't think I would ever I I could never entertain the idea of like smashing eggs everywhere it doesn't seem like a good plan and I don't know what I would gain from that
B	yeah
A	and in fact I've never really understood people who do that like who smash things and mess things up when they're
B	smashers?
A	like I can understand people who
B	I am not a smasher
A	you know people get caught like going for wees in different places and stuff
A	but
B	yeah
A	I mean I saw a lot of it
B	yeah
A	when I was an assistant dean but
B	yeah I mean this was probably a lot of that sort of stuff
A	of course I mean
B	but
A	but I think we always give like we always did give people
B	yeah
A	or why they were doing it
B	well that's terrible using that as an excuse isn't it?
A	and like
B	oh yeah well I guess uh
A	you know like it when you get people doing stuff like that it's just
B	that was a legendary you know it's like Animal House have you ever seen that?
A	I have seen Animal House
B	think I tried to show you that
A	no
B	you know in reality like
A	what's the soup like?
B	like
A	is it?
B	I'll taste it now when it's new
A	it doesn't look as thick as normal but I'm sure it'd be nice
B	right well d'you want me to do anything to rectify that?
A	no no no it doesn't need to be thick
B	um
A	oh thank you
B	oh okay
A	it's quite sort of spicy
B	yeah I maybe put a little bit too much chilli in there but uh that's fine
A	no I don't think you did I think it's nice
B	yeah
A	you can't go wrong with a butternut squash I think
B	it is a nice it's that sweetness is good um
A	you can't go very far wrong
B	yeah
A	few lentils
B	yeah I
A	what you gonna do with that mackerel tomorrow?
B	put it like two two garlics and the bacon went in
A	yeah
B	uh I dunno
A	dunno it's just
B	uh what you would you
A	it's kinda nice just with
B	maybe something like um Chinesey just um
A	I quite like mackerel just just
B	noodles and that
A	yeah that sounds nice
B	um
A	dunno it's quite it's got quite a strong taste in itself hasn't it like? I normally just put like salt and pepper on and just like
B	yeah
A	you should tell your mam that you
B	did you
A	ever?
B	yeah
A	um

B	yeah
A	that doesn't mean it's a bad film it just means it's not the sort of film I like
B	yeah
A	I dunno like um
A	die Hard might might not be like a cinematic masterpiece
