B	very true and very true
A	I'm just conscious that I'm gonna ruin your clothes because they are nice
B	well you better fucking not then
A	at least with the clothes I wear I don't actually care because they are shit
B	you see a lot of mine are very erm I'm a very appealing person
D	I'm very good at getting stains out

A	and did she get it out of that as well didn't you have tan all over that?
B	yeah it's still a bit pinky
A	oh mother
D	where?
B	but I reckon if it goes no but that was literally it rained and everything
A	mother
D	but did you tell me you'd got tan on it because otherwise I would have well give it me back and I'll put some Vanish on it
B	it wasn't me
C	that was like that video that I tagged you in did you watch it?
B	no it's only at the back
D	I'll put some Vanish on it
C	but then I don't know if it is tan
A	oh no because it looks like it's down the
C	let's have a look
B	this bit
A	that bit I don't know
B	so I don't actually know I do like this yeah
D	well if you don't tell me I don't know do I?
C	it's like that video innit that I tagged you all in girls after a night out why the fuck did I wear the white shorts? there's fucking tan everywhere
A	that was so funny even though
C	we ate a melon I think one night
A	oh
C	because that was incredible
A	we were
A	oh yeah
C	I love that dress
A	I like it but it just looked rubbish on me
C	what size is it?
B	eight
A	probably eight
C	I might fit in that now
A	that's probably more you
B	or
A	no it ain't happening
B	well I don't know if you borrow them
C	ah they are nice I like those
A	are they even taller?
C	yeah but they are thicker
B	yeah but when you think about it right look you

A	oh look at my toes though
C	yes that's a good idea
D	there's nothing wrong with your bloody toes
A	there is they look so long
C	cos you could wear the white one and then I don't know what top but
B	I'm sure we could find a top
A	what what
B	I don't know
A	but you have to choose
C	I think a night out because they'll be comfortable but you would look nice
A	oh my god look at my gross legs
B	why do you look so

A	am I allowed to wear them on a night out though?
B	yeah
A	how much were they?

B	right
A	no
B	I do have some nice clothes I feel so proud

A	can I would it work as like?
C	you could just twist it around your wrist another couple of times

D	I know I saw the real thing but
A	well are they like has she got dots down the side?
B	mm little erm
C	stuck on things isn't it
A	so we got outfit so I could wear my hippy dress for the evening meal on Friday couldn't I because that's quite comfy actually like
C	oh I don't know
D	mm
A	it's flat because well I'd probably won't need to wear heels will I?
C	right so what's your
B	why can't you wear heels though?
A	well I can
B	if you are just staying in
C	so what are doing?
A	Friday we are going up and we are setting up because a lot of people aren't getting there until the evening like one person is not even getting there till nine

A	because like
C	mm
D	really
A	oh no
C	no he's just chilling on his own with the dogs
A	just entertaining himself
B	see I think if you are having cocktails as a person that takes a lot of photos people will be taking photos of the cocktails and then the cameras will be out and people will be taking photos it's a hen do people are obviously going to be taking photos you still want to look nice?
D	what do you think?
A	yeah
B	so why can't you wear heels you will only be in
A	do you ever what
C	wait is it the same night as the oh no that's Friday night
A	no this is Saturday night so
B	what are you wearing for the naked chef?
A	I don't know so I won't
C	is that before this?
A	yeah I might just not eat a lot
B	oh
A	yeah I erm there's one of
D	have you got Drambuie?

D	have you gone to sleep
B	mm
A	yeah and I'm quite and it like skims over that bit
B	cos I was very conscious but it's not a cutting in skirt it's a little bit looser isn't it?
A	yeah
C	because it goes out even if your belly goes bloated and it skims forward it's a poofy style dress so you will just think it's the poof rather than belly
A	yeah
B	the top does rise up a little bit every now and again you just have to keep pulling it down
A	yeah that's fine
B	yeah just wear no VPL knickers
A	yeah that's fine but what bra? could I borrow your bra?
B	I wore a strapless bra yeah I don't know where it is
A	don't worry if not because I could technically wear my nude it's just not as like actually I couldn't cos it goes like that
C	try it on with this just in case that shows
B	er if it's anywhere it's in the wash
A	okay
B	I really need to get ready I'm going to
A	well I don't know
C	no she's wearing that for going out
B	yeah the naked chef is before going out
A	yeah
C	yeah but you don't want to spill food down it because then
A	I will be annoyed with myself if I get something down it cos I want to wear it out now
B	well why don't you then wear the white dress oh no because that's white mm
A	I would wear I do love that dress
B	do you want to wear that Friday then?
A	but but that's still eating but then it's cocktails as well isn't it?
B	yeah
C	what about my blue and white dress that's a T-shirt dress?
B	mm that's nice
A	oh I've got my one but that's really short though is yours really short?
C	I don't think so
A	I've literally like got boob and bum out do you remember?

B	so is that Friday?
A	yeah
B	or Saturday?
C	no that's Saturday before that isn't it?
A	I don't know
B	it could be either
A	what yeah I kind of feel it's pointless dressing up for the dinner and for going out but
B	you know you are gonna wanna
A	yeah like yeah like you said for only like photos
C	the only thing is if you are in the house and you are like say sitting on the settee or something and it's really short
A	yeah you will see up there
C	mm that's the only thing
A	what heels could I wear with my other one? that one
C	those brown ones
A	so shall I just shall I just wear that Friday?
C	mm yeah
A	cos that is really comfy like it just goes over my belly
C	yeah with those brown heels
A	cos
C	and also you'll be in so you probably won't even wear heels so I really wouldn't worry
A	yeah so okay that's Friday sorted
B	hippy dress brown heels
A	hippy dress brown heels then evening dinner on Saturday oh no we haven't got that yet but that's the only one I need to sort out now

A	they are not leggings they are only tights
C	so I wear two pairs of leggings but the pair that I used to wear on top were always looser if I didn't wear a pair underneath so I'd be scared that if I didn't wear tights underneath them again they would be baggy
