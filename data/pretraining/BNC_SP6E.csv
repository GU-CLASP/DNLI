A	mm
C	well won't be thinking about it until my foot's better anyway
A	mm
C	erm
A	I mean those crash courses are quite good but the trouble with that is if you don't get the driving experience and then you don't do any driving until you come back
C	yeah
A	you're
C	mm
A	you know cos driving is practise
C	mm
A	it's like riding a bike you know
C	mm
A	yeah
C	that was the plan but I wanted to get just a bit of practice first
A	mm
D	what's happened about work? Anything? Have you heard anything?
C	um
B	thank you

C	no que ser√°
A	mm

C	hmm
B	we said because she never spends any money on herself
A	mm
B	and for her to choose something that she wants only her
A	mm
B	because any money she gets she just
C	mm

C	huh? Cruise control?
B	cruise control
D	cruise control
A	oh yeah
B	but I didn't  I didn't  use that
A	oh that's brilliant that
B	is it?
A	yeah
B	I I didn't even look where it was
A	especially on long journeys
B	yeah but I just wanted to practise
B	you know? So
A	mm
C	is it?
A	that's that's what the benefit is yeah
B	mm
A	it it saves fuel because it will keep the engine going at
C	hmm
B	A steady pace
C	mm
A	yeah
B	mm
C	hmm
B	that's alright you can just
A	whatever you touch if you touch the clutch or the brake
C	it just switches off
B	mm
A	it switches it off
C	oh okay
A	and then you press R resume
C	mm
A	you get back up to speed you press resume and it takes over again
C	oh
A	and if you find you're doing just that little bit too fast
C	yeah
A	and it's like or if you wanna increase slightly you just plus it a little bit
C	mm
D	which for somebody like erm
C	mm
D	it's ideal isn't it
A	that journey he's doing yeah
C	mm
D	and you've only got to go up to sixty-five seventy and your petrol consumption goes whoosh doesn't it
A	you fuel count yeah it doubles yeah
C	mm
B	mm
C	ha
B	yeah I've heard that before
A	mm
D	mm mm
C	hmm
A	oh yeah it's er your right foot controls you're your right
C	hmm mm
D	I'll tell you that next time
A	yeah
A	I used to teach people how to do that on the
C	mm
A	at the
C	hmm
B	mm
A	by maintaining the same speed you could half the fuel consumption
B	mm
C	hmm
A	just by getting up to speed and then take your foot off the
C	hmm
A	not enough to slow the car down but you watch the fuel consumption drop
C	mm
A	yeah it's er it's a clever technique
C	mm
A	mm
B	well we've gotta practise with a four wheel drive for that
C	mm
D	yeah
A	has it gone up?
D	yep
A	I thought or er it hasn't changed
D	no it's gone up
A	no it's gone up
D	cigarettes has gone up thirty-seven P for a packet
C	yeah
B	mm
D	that's a real wallop innit?
C	yeah
A	no
C	and he was saying er smoking's gonna become a rich man's er drug
B	oh dear
D	I wonder if they was refuse to um treat them in hospital?
C	hmm mm

D	that's what they're supposed to be doing isn't it
B	ah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	hmm
D	like Georgie Best innit?
C	mm
A	that was
B	yeah
A	that's why they are doing that with obesity
C	mm
B	there was a big thing about him wasn't there?
C	mm
A	they do say to people that you know
C	mm
A	it the risk is too great
D	but my ex niece who had a a gastric band fitted it don't look as if it's worked cos she's erm still huge
C	yeah? Really?
B	really?
D	mm
C	hmm
D	mm
C	and she's not eating as much as she was?
D	mm mm
C	hmm
B	that's the  that's the  thing with that there's two types of people that can get obese isn't there?
D	I didn't think they were
A	mm
B	no
C	no
B	no
C	so it's
D	Cos that's what happened to
A	you've probably never saw her cousin
D	she's gone from whoof
A	she was big like a gross American
B	mm
D	mm
A	er you know I mean you know it's about as big as it can get
B	but
A	but she's now smaller than trim er thinner than
C	hmm
D	mm
C	hmm
B	but there is two types of people isn't there? There's people that eat an excess just cos they want to
A	mm
D	I think she eats a lot
B	oh
A	yeah
D	but I didn't think she would be able to once she had the gastric band
B	no
A	the western world though obesity is through overindulgence
C	mm
B	mm mm
A	yeah I mean it's ha ha I mean it's MacDonald's
B	oh yeah
C	yep

A	and we considered that we were at the good life
C	mm
D	mm
A	you know let's eat out every night
C	mm
A	and a bottle of wine here and a bottle of wine there and
D	mm

C	mm
B	yeah
A	oi you're massive
A	what a nice person
B	ah
C	mm
B	bless him
D	I'm not surprised

D	it's like my friend
D	I really don't wanna hear about
B	it just slips out the wrong way?
A	yeah she's she's
B	mm
A	she's a very funny woman she is
D	well she says she doesn't but I'm still not sure
B	I couldn't remember any of those jokes you told me from your phone

C	mm
B	er but I haven't I just can't I haven't no memory for the jokes
C	no
B	no memory at all
A	well
D	and now they've got rid of them
A	her as well
A	and then about it's usually about an hour later isn't it
D	I know she does drive you mad
C	lots of people have said that?
D	but you'll be fine
A	some people say that I've got tomato down my shirt
D	you'll be fine
A	who who died
D	yeah
C	yeah
D	mm
C	make you feel like you've got something in common
A	mm
C	but they they don't think of the consequences of what they're saying
A	mm
C	mm
D	well Sally text me yesterday and said that she was watching
C	mm
D	just sort of
C	mm
A	mm
C	but there's something every day isn't there?
D	mm
A	yeah if that was a  if that was a  fact doctors would be prescribing it for you
C	yeah
A	you know that comedian on the telly
C	mm
A	you know he said you know all this homoeopathy?
C	mm mm
A	and all this sort of thing
C	mm it's sugar isn't it
A	and yeah yeah
A	and he said all the other stuff he says is mumbo jumbo
C	yeah but there's
B	but a lot of them are placebo
C	yeah
B	mm
A	yeah
B	you know positive thinking
A	mm
B	if you believe that it you know any kind of medicine's going to work then it's gonna help you
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	it's like the big debate at the moment is praying isn't it? Because of this Muamba the guy who had a heart attack on the foot ball pitch
B	mm
A	mm?
C	all these footballers have been saying and tweeting like pray for Muamba
A	mm
C	you know?
B	well they had a big debate
D	well they didn't do that for my cousin who died
C	hmm mm?
D	they didn't do that for my cousin that died
C	yeah exactly
B	yeah they had a big debate about it didn't they
C	well exactly there was a good debate on radio two the other day about prayer
B	or leaving it up to the medicine and the good people at the NHS who were helping
C	yeah
B	it's difficult
A	yeah
D	well I've got some tablets
A	mm
D	and opposite Jarrolds
C	mm mm
B	mm
D	and what happened
C	mm
D	and if I don't take them I'm usually awake about six o'clock ain't I?
A	mm mm
D	half past five
B	mm mm
C	mm
D	so is that?
C	yeah it is psychological
A	psychological
C	mm
D	psychological? Cos I'm taking something
C	yeah
A	I've got a horrible itch right in the corner of my eye
A	really stick my finger in it
D	Don't you dare
B	Don't touch it
C	mm
C	hmm
A	I mean
B	think of your spaghetti
A	no I'm fine
B	think of something else
C	mm
A	mm
C	and it makes me so angry when they run out onto the pitch and they do all this like Catholic you know
B	some of them might
C	well
A	mm
C	you know as if God is gonna ha oh I want that player to be you know score against that team
C	yeah
A	in football matches
C	I mean how selfish like
A	mm
B	hmm mm mm
A	oh it is
C	oh God yeah
A	I mean unfortunately there's
C	yeah
A	that there's some divine being there
C	mm
A	you know?
C	I think it's insanity it really is
A	why did you get hit by the truck? Well it's God's will
C	mm
D	well it's everybody's everybody's own belief
C	mm
D	some
C	mm
B	mm
D	and it helps them
C	mm
D	I don't believe that my mum is in for instance or my relations are in that grave
C	mm
D	so there's no point in me going to that grave
C	mm
D	if they grass it over
C	mm
D	I believe that my mum is here
C	mm
D	with me all the time
C	yeah
B	mm
D	constantly
C	mm
D	but some people do
B	mm
D	you know it's the same as belief in God
C	mm
D	but I wouldn't spout it off
C	mm
D	because it's my belief
C	mm
B	mm
A	I think religion
C	mm
A	you know
C	it's just energy isn't it
D	yeah
A	that's right
B	mm
A	you are remembered by your offspring and your generations ahead of you
B	mm
A	they remember you with affection because you were good
B	yep
A	if you were evil they wouldn't wanna know
C	well I dunno
A	erm er
B	mm
D	yeah
A	yeah but not not with affection
C	no with admiration a lot of people
D	yep
A	uh-uh-uh
C	I mean look at Hitler and how many people admire Hitler
A	oh yeah
C	I mean he still gets talk
A	but er but I think that's where this thing about you know you will live forever
C	mm
D	you'll live  you'll live  forever with
D	and that really you know it irritates him to death but he's got it
C	I haven't got it

A	mm
B	it is the expressions that give it away mostly
A	that was lovely
C	mm

B	it's not the physical features
C	mm
D	well you're your mum's daughter to a tee

A	oh God knows
C	mm
A	three of them
C	mm
A	they expect it
C	yep
A	and er they spoilt them rotten
C	huh
A	and the last five years he's done that and he's now broke
C	what?
A	yeah
C	hmm
A	that which was good when they had could afford it
C	that's crazy
A	he's a gambler though
C	mm
A	to do the one-eyed bandits
C	what?
A	yeah
C	ha ha
A	I was like why is that? He said I put a hundred and fifty quid in that
C	oh dear
A	yeah oh that's how he is
C	ah oh God
A	but they er they're now moving in
C	hmm
A	like two and a half thousand pound they just paid for a suit
C	what do they buy everything on credit or something?
A	no
C	Cos if it isn't that much money
A	no they
C	mm
A	I mean with that much money you should have paid the mortgage off
C	yeah
A	it's only an ex-council house they have
C	ha
A	he turned the bloody shed into a studio not long ago
C	hmm
A	his son
A	no they just take the piss out of him and watch them go down the drain
C	hmm
A	you know
C	mm
A	said that well they're moving down to this mobile home cos they can't sell that
C	hmm
A	he only paid sixty-two for it at the beginning of the season and they'll give him twenty-four for it
C	oh dear
A	yeah and so they've decided to live there
C	mm
A	so they're gonna move there
C	yep well it's amazing how many um people are moving into caravans
D	does anybody want any garlic bread before I dump it?
A	hmm? No no thank you darling
C	no thanks
D	no?
C	yeah
A	mm
C	lot lots of people I've been speaking to recently are thinking about moving into campsites
A	yeah
C	seems to be the way this country's going
A	well it's like America with their trailer parks innit
C	yeah
A	you know
C	no one can afford to buy a house
A	when we were in Calgary I couldn't believe it
C	hmm
A	have you seen their caravans? Aren't they they put them on the back of vans
C	mm
A	and they just wind the legs down and then drive the truck away from under them
C	hmm
A	you know row upon row of them
C	hmm
A	all the way down the highway
C	mm
A	all the oil workers moved there for work but can't find anywhere to live
C	hmm
A	no accommodation for this
C	mm
A	well no it's just our economic climate that's doing this innit
C	mm
A	but I can't believe they're er that man can lose that much money
C	hmm
A	yeah yeah
C	and that's it
A	and when you are earning that much money
C	yeah
A	then it's I forget what it is after that
C	I have no idea
A	well and then when you get over a certain amount it's fifty percent
C	yeah
A	it's like footballers' wages innit
C	mm
A	well his agent is gonna take a quarter twenty-five percent of that
C	mm
A	then the tax man is gonna have about eighty percent of it
C	hmm
A	you know it's like alright they've still got a good living
C	well they've probably got all these offshore accounts though haven't they?
A	well
C	mm
A	that's why a lot of them disappear abroad
C	mm
A	you know like
C	no er well a lot of people are still coming to England though for the football
A	mm
C	so it must be worth it like worth their while rather than going to Spain or Italy
A	well I think what it is
C	yeah well that's er
A	they might live in their house you know the mansion that belongs to the football club
C	mm
A	so you know although they you know they don't give that a money pre-value
C	hmm
A	instead of twelve thousand pound a week
C	mm
A	your you know your phone's covered
C	mm
A	cleaners
C	right
A	so it works out they get a bloody good lifestyle
C	well
A	you know
C	yeah I was speaking to someone erm his mate worked in
A	yeah
C	erm and they were in the second division at that time which is what the old fourth division
A	yeah
C	guess how much he was on a month?
A	go on
C	after tax
A	yeah
C	or was it a week? It was something
A	yeah
C	it was ridiculous
A	I worked with a an apprentice
C	that was three grand a week
A	yeah he worked for us but and they bought him a car
C	mm
A	the house and er
C	hmm
A	as a a an apprentice player
C	hmm
A	but he was out working with us
C	mm
A	you know cos he was
C	hmm
A	oh yeah
C	I mean
A	yeah
C	I think a lot of these
A	I can't understand Rangers
C	mm
A	you know absolutely disgraceful
C	mm
A	and well when you say management is to blame that's why the country's in such a state
C	yeah
A	poor management
C	yeah
A	you know you can't blame the  you can't blame the  lowest paid worker
C	yeah
A	for putting the company in the hock
C	mm
A	it's the high pay ones that have done it
C	mm
A	yeah
C	so why not?
A	yeah might as well milk it while you can
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	why not?
A	the cow died
C	yeah
A	mm
A	yeah perhaps we've done something wrong
C	mm
A	I'm not worried about a knock on the door
C	mm
D	I'm going in here
C	right
A	yeah so it's values isn't it
C	yeah that's er
C	it's about being content
A	yeah
C	that's all it is
A	yeah I mean I I'd love to be a millionaire
C	would you? I'm not fussed
A	yeah
C	ah huh
A	I'd love to surprise people
C	hmm
A	say you like that? Go on it's yours
C	yeah
