B	yeah yeah
D	they don't just smell naturally do they?
A	which would you choose? to skip all Christmases or to skip every birthday?
D	mm
C	birthday
E	mm
F	skip every birthday
E	yeah
A	does that mean you don't get any older?
E	yeah
unknown_female	well no
E	doesn't say that
C	yeah I think birthday
G	no Christmas
unknown_female	mm
C	really?
G	yeah because yeah definitely
I	just to it just says to skip every birthday
D	I think it means your own birthday
D	yeah it'd mean your own
G	oh
J	I would've thought it did
C	you never have any Christmases again or you never have any birthdays again
G	I think let's keep everybody's birthday yeah okay
F	Christmases?
G	yeah
G	anyway
E	er which would you choose? for everything to happen twice as quickly
I	hello
E	or for everything to happen at half the speed?
B	half the speed
D	mm
F	half the speed yeah
C	that depends
F	depends what it is if it's something horrible
I	well it does if you're having
C	a working day
D	yeah
E	yeah
D	depends what it is yeah
F	visit to the dentist
D	things that you enjoy though would go really quickly and you'd be like sad
F	you know Sunday afternoons at half the speed
I	definitely if it works
B	you wouldn't know you'd be out
D	yeah but let's say you were doing painting you'd just get twice as much done in the same amount of time
unknown_female	yeah
J	you'd be unconscious here wouldn't you?
unknown_female	yeah
D	yeah that's true yeah actually yeah
I	yeah I try they don't let me give you anything
G	like you could still
I	that was my name
D	oh I see
B	yeah
D	everything goes twice as fast
I	oh
D	in that case then then there's no point in twice as fast it'd just be proportionally the same wouldn't it?
G	yeah but you'd get twice as much done in your life
D	yeah yeah I guess
E	I'm joking
D	depends what it means doesn't it?
D	yeah
F	which would you choose? to lose your sense of smell or lose your sense of taste?
F	what do you reckon? you get both don't you? together?
D	oh
B	that's it yeah smell affects taste
F	so that's probably a null and void one that one
G	taste
I	sorry I thought he was I've left enough for him there
A	you're alright
F	I'd probably if you had if it if it was separate I suppose I'd lose my sense of smell and having a sense of taste
D	no I wouldn't
F	probably
E	yeah
I	it was the last time I went out but that
D	I'd lose my sense of taste I think
F	no I would no I'd want my taste
I	do you want another wine or coffee or anything?
J	er
A	I don't think so
I	can you manage?
D	er no I feel like smells are quite nostalgic
D	and like quite homely and quite like
G	yeah
D	they give you emotions and moods whereas taste is just an indulgence
F	no taste taste taste is a big thing when you when you're eating something isn't it?
E	mm
F	if it tasted of nothing you wouldn't wanna eat it would you?
G	yeah but that's just but that's just food though
D	yeah
G	whereas I think smells are are quite sort of sentimental and quite emotional
D	smell covers lots of things
F	no I'd still rather taste though
F	I'm sorry can't agree with you
F	you're talking rubbish
I	you told me I couldn't give him any
J	no turkey's alright
