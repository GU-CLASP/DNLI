A	sort of when I'm talking I'm I'm a bit unaware of it but if there's a lull in the conversation I start thinking I've got to say something
A	I've got to say something otherwise the tape recording's going to be all empty and then I start erm
C	well what they should do on the news instead of always moaning about the negative they should there's always a story if you looked on the positive side so ah the population's dropping off this could mean this and this
A	yeah
C	and all these positives instead of going oh the schools aren't filling up there aren't enough kids this means there's gonna be too many old people and not enough young people
B	yeah but that and there is
A	but
C	I suppose it just drives me mad no wonder everyone's depressed
D	uhu
A	mm
D	it's true yeah
B	the trouble is
A	I agree
B	what you it's the that's the
A	mm
B	like you were saying about the Coca-Cola bottles
A	yeah yeah
B	erm
A	mm
B	people go back to nostalgia
A	mm
B	when they're in recession and that it's the good old times
A	yeah
B	and I've seen more of them glass bottles of Coke and I'm thinking well why have they bought that?
A	yeah yeah it's just companies capitalise on the mood of the day don't they?
B	but then
A	mm yeah
B	because I remember like erm
A	and
C	I was
A	I don't know
B	what like the rhythm you're talking about?
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	erm that
A	oh that's interesting
C	so some of the supermarkets er carefully pick their music
B	you see I quite like B and Q music
C	maybe they've
B	they
C	so carefully selected it
B	er they obviously have
A	yeah
B	because it's a maybe it's my age and my era and it's all the things that
C	yeah
B	I like and you go into other shops and it's all very young and funky
C	mm
A	mm mm
C	yeah have you have you ever been into Hollister? oh
A	Hollister is that the underwear?

C	really loud music
A	dark and dim lighting
C	and the smells have you there are really strong smells
B	of what?
C	erm just artificial perfumy like aerosolly type smells
A	but it's always I always find their shops the Hollister shops dark and dingy
C	it is
A	and depressing they depress me
C	yeah it's dark depressing and it absolutely stinks
A	and like
C	and it makes me feel sick
A	absolutely don't
C	and the music is really loud
A	make me want to buy anything but even if it
C	but I guess you're not the demographic they're after are you?
A	well no I'm not
C	I'm not the demographic they're after
B	what are they what sort of things do they sell sorry?
A	highly expensive fashion items really out
B	clothes or underwear?
C	it's clothes
A	clothes it's
C	yeah yeah
A	yeah
C	or everything
A	but it it it does aim at the teenage market where
C	you kind of
A	if you've got Hollister clothes then you're really cool
B	oh right
A	erm
C	yeah
B	so designer label?

C	yeah
A	that kind of thing
C	yeah
A	yeah mm and are aren't Hollister the ones who will only have really
C	yeah

C	they yeah there was erm
A	as their models and
C	apparently the CEO of Hollister said well I know he said this cos it was in the thing but erm he said he doesn't want his clothes being worn by ugly or fat people and apparently I'm not sure how true this is but they have erm representatives that go round charity shops buying all the Hollister clothes that have been given there cos they don't want them to don't want people who go to charity shops the type of people that go to charity shops aren't the kind of people they want wearing their clothes
C	so they don't want them being sold in charity
B	oh that's terrible
C	I don't know how true that one is
D	brilliant that's a good idea
C	erm

A	yeah
B	was as thick

A	we yeah
C	I'll probably just stick with the middle
A	you know how we hate people who go for the low
C	okay
B	the low offer
A	yeah well it depends how much is in the you know if you're playing a number four and you've got like a thousand pounds in the pot you may as well go for the big one
C	yeah
C	well no cos then if you if you get through you get a share of what everyone else has won
A	well what I'm saying if if there's if the one share is like
C	oh yeah yeah yeah
A	mm
C	no that would panic me
A	absolute panic I cannot think under pressure
B	erm I'm not really sure
A	yeah
B	er
A	pass
B	when I was at work the other day this man wanted to book in and er he was like trying to justify his attendance
A	mm

B	comes natural
A	well what about
A	I was out
C	oh it was disgusting
A	and
B	no
A	she nearly passed
C	it was disgusting it
A	anyway when they got
C	was really deep
A	outside to the car they realised that I had one car and the other car was at the garage
B	oh
D	never read the packet
A	look at what's on the box
A	he didn't even know the name of his insulin and I didn't either because
B	it's Insulatard
C	well yeah but he's a he's a grown man you don't need to
A	no it's Novomix 30 oh
C	he's a grown man
A	well exactly
C	you don't need to look after his insulin for him
A	and I just I felt absolutely mortified standing in front of this nurse he didn't even know the name of his own insulin
C	yeah but dad doesn't know
D	well why would I need
C	his own age
A	so that was the first thing I did
A	when I got home
A	I looked in the fridge at the box
A	so that in future  would always be able to say
A	what he's on
C	why was
A	but
C	his insulin relevant to him cutting his hand?
A	well his
B	why do you think?
C	I don't know
D	yeah why is it? I've no idea
B	because your circulation
A	yes
B	with your diabetic retinopathy and you haven't got so good sensation
A	she never speaks in English
C	I can't understand what you're talking about
A	you know what? you are the worst teacher ever
A	you assume that your pupils know as much as you
B	you don't know what diabetic retinopathy is?
A	I'm not talking about me I'm talking about
C	I don't
B	the feeling
B	the feeling
C	okay
B	it's
C	so like your numbness?
B	like
A	yeah that's why they're erm
B	they have to be very careful
A	it's not uncommon
C	more common than non er diabetics?
A	you're more susceptible to things like you know having to have your leg amputated
B	tated
A	I think if you get an ulcer or that's why I always say to dad he should wear
B	and it takes longer to heal
C	oh right okay
B	because you're not getting the supply of blood
A	yeah no I wasn't talking about me I was talking about
B	oh

C	I thought that was just the official word
B	I always say auxiliary still
A	er?
B	I still say auxiliary
A	I no I haven't said auxiliary I say carer I haven't said auxiliary for years
B	I don't know
C	auxiliary I think means on the side of like an added thing
A	that's a bit well they're just like an added
C	like an auxiliary verb I know I only know this from when I did English language an auxiliary verb is a verb that kind of is added on an extra one that's er so I'm assuming
A	oh that's a bit of an insult
C	that's what auxiliary means
A	isn't it? you're a bit of an extra added on thing
B	like a growth
C	maybe that's why they're not called auxiliaries anymore
A	it's like there but not really needed
