A	are you recording?
A	yeah
A	I think it might be digital memory
B	digital memory
B	I'm so fucking scared
A	of what?
B	of being engaged
A	why?
B	like don't take this the wrong way
B	I'm twenty years old right so I mean well
B	I know but
A	you should be ready for it
B	I am in a way ready for it
A	but you said it's not gonna be for six years or so anyway
B	yeah it's gonna be from it's not gonna be for ages yet but
B	but but like
A	I don't think it's necessarily a new thinking to you know what I think it's slightly
B	I know but it's like do you know what I mean?
B	yeah like all the girls wanna
A	yeah
B	no but like do you know when you're told you can't I don't know if you're the same but I am very malcontent like I
B	and I'm like that and I'm thinking yeah I could do this and I could do that
A	I'm not I'm not a
B	no but like
A	I've got a lot more of
B	yeah but I have every single human in the world has
A	yeah
B	but the thing is like basically now I have committed to spending the rest of my life with one person and don't get me wrong I love
A	yeah
B	and I could never do it but I really want to because I can't and it's not even just that I can't it's like the fact that I'm twenty-three years old like do I really want to settle down with one person now for the rest of my life? and I have I've got two choices I can either
A	the difficulty is is
B	mm
B	mm
A	everything that happens like that is it it happens and there will be obstacles that come up
B	mm
A	like mixed feelings
B	yeah
A	I don't know where they come from but er
B	no I have I've already I've already and it's probably the wine the wine making me say this but I have always found you attractive when I first met you I thought you were attractive and I fancied you and I have always fancied you and we have
A	I have
B	you know and it's like it's so difficult and I love
A	he's probably ready to do this
B	he's ready to do it and I don't know if I am
A	right
B	and I don't know if I and he wants children and shit like that and I don't think I do like don't get me wrong right now I don't want children ever like right now I think my life
B	it would stop everything it would stop everything
B	it's different for a man
A	yeah
B	like they can
A	yeah
B	they don't have to breast-feed they don't have to do all that shit and like to me it's so scary because like I'm gonna graduate university when I'm twenty-six and I'm doing a year in industry so the next four years I've got another
A	you've got everything planned out that you're doing so
B	I'm doing stuff and my plan when I finish uni will always be travel always
A	no
B	what if
A	no
B	what if blah blah what if
A	or er and you don't wanna do either of em
B	and I don't wanna do either
B	I don't wanna cheat and I don't wanna like
B	I mean awful like cos er
A	what I will do is erm you go away for a while don't don't be in contact for like a month or whatever and then see if
B	yeah
A	mm
B	you can eat off this menu and that's it
B	yeah
A	I I
A	er a greater extent but it is nothing I can relate to I suppose
B	so anyway let's get off the personal things and
A	yeah
B	I'd like to talk about erm so you want to be a music teacher?
B	don't you don't you think
A	I know
B	no I know but it's not cos I don't want to it's because every time you have something going on I have something going on and I'm always devastated
A	don't
B	no but I'm always devastated and whether you make it or not I'm always devastated that I can't get
A	there's a there's a lot of fans out there yeah and what I will say there's a lot of
B	you are different
A	and I think
B	like I can't put erm I can't stick a genre on you do you know when
A	I call it I say like indie rock but some of the songs aren't that so I
B	no
A	er my favourite band is the Red Hot Chili Peppers yeah?
B	yeah
A	and I've always loved them because
B	me too
A	yeah really?
B	I love the Red Hot Chili Peppers absolutely fucking adore them I've grown up with them and I fucking
A	like I I wasn't quite like that the thing I love about them is like every album's different they're not just rock like there'll be a song full of like
B	different innit?
A	yeah
B	every single thing they do from the first to the current album every single album is different it offers something else
A	but that that's what I love about them that's why my
B	really?
A	we all
B	they stick with one thing don't they? like Kasabian's latest album is the same as every other album they've ever done
A	yeah I hate that one as well
B	I fucking hate it
B	forty-eight thirty-three or something
A	yeah
B	like why
A	got erm they've got one song on it so like easy which was a single which I thought were alright and I listened to the entire album like
B	shit
A	oh
B	yeah it's the same it's the same as all the rest right?
A	do you know who I think's really good at the moment?
B	it I I love Ed Sheeran cos like he does like a song he'll do one song say he'll do a really slow song and be really downbeat and like really like life affirming or whatever and then you'll listen to his next song
B	erm and then you'll listen to the next one like completely different the ones that you've heard the first time and that's what I love about him he's different he doesn't stick to oh I'm so depressed and I hate everyone and I'm singing melancholy songs and it goes up and it then goes back down but oh I love that about him really do like that he changes but you listen to pop songs and they all sound the same
A	yeah
B	like don't get me wrong I love pop songs I love listening to like
A	you a top forty pop person?
B	no
A	oh so
B	I love really obscure bands like I love The Smiths
A	oh right
B	Blur Chili Peppers have you ever heard erm Crash Test Dummies?
B	they were like erm all the songs sound the same in a way but that's because the singer the lead singer has got a distinct voice
A	right
B	so so all his songs they don't sound the same the melody the melody's different the chords or whatever they are
B	they all sound different
A	you learn
B	yeah I'm learning but his his voice is so distinct that this this
A	the only real
B	he can rap and sing
A	yeah he can do everything he is brilliant
B	yeah
A	but there's not a lot of people out there right now that are different there's a lot of people that have similar voices or something like that and what I wanna do is I don't have a great natural voice I want to make my voice something different
B	special
A	I want to make it stand out
B	yeah
A	even if I can't
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	but I can't do it but I can I can compromise
