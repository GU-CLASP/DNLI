A	I certainly haven't for many many years but I may have done
B	yeah

B	yeah I think I remember we went there with school when I was primary school I think but I don't think since then I'm not sure I've been in the house
A	I remember them all going to a lake which apparently was the other end but yeah
B	yeah that's by the folly
A	yeah
B	which is falling down ironically
A	yeah
B	so they're having to rebuild the folly
A	oh mm
B	cos erm we used to our primary school was you could walk across the field and end up at the folly
A	oh right
B	so sometimes we used to go there from school
A	oh mm

B	those views that you get of it
A	yeah well it's not only

B	oh so they still have they have like the farm and everything?
C	yeah it's exactly the same as when you were little
A	yeah mm yeah and the house itself is very similar must be the same sort of either the same period or
C	yeah it's got that sort of balcony thing hasn't it?
A	yeah
C	and you then look over and you see the erm really nice countryside
A	oh yeah
B	I don't I don't remember where it is even

C	oh okay
B	erm
C	yeah I knew it needed some oil or something actually
A	mm
B	yeah so it's stuck I'm afraid but I reckon a bit of oil bit of wiggling it'll be absolutely fine
C	yeah okay do you see what I mean about the tyres not being quite full?
B	yeah and I was going to leave it out for someone to pump the tyres up but then I put it in the shed
C	well dad can do it tomorrow
B	I think you need to pump them up otherwise you might damage the bike
C	oh I know I know they need pumping up and you can't go as fast when they're not pumped up
A	have we finished?
B	it's still recording
A	oh

C	mm
B	what did you do at
C	er well we walked on the winter walk which wasn't very wintery
A	mm
C	but then you get into a bit and there's just cyclamen just everywhere it's just like a carpet of cyclamen it's just beautiful

A	mm
C	then the rose garden was still quite good actually
A	oh mm very late
C	erm yeah erm and those you know those white trees? were just beautiful really erm
A	mm
C	are Himalayan birch trees so we just did the sort of big round walk we didn't go into the fen bits that they've opened up recently

C	mm the house is really nice at
A	mm mm
B	small?

A	mm
B	oh what? into the one with the purple door?
B	it's purple innit?
C	oh bloody hell she's had it painted recently
B	well purpley navy blue
C	well they might not be the new people that might be
A	mm
C	I don't think there's anything in the house
B	there's two sets of new neighbours so a lot for my mum to spy on
C	mm mm mm
A	oh
C	and I think I don't know I think she's still there actually

A	yeah
D	oh yes
A	mm
B	hello
D	hello
B	how are you?
B	yeah?
D	quite tired
A	yeah it was a good job I didn't come on erm
D	eh yes it probably was
C	well you wouldn't have erm walked
D	cos you wouldn't have gone where we went
A	no no it wasn't the walk I don't know yeah oh
D	and er I would have preferred not to go all that sort of way on my own
A	mm mm
D	you know? it was
C	well you have you follow round I mean well
D	yeah yes yes it was nice wasn't it? it was around the walk
C	yeah no it's better if you don't not having to keep looking at the map and stuff
D	yeah
B	was it pretty?
D	oh it was lovely I was most impressed yes with it
B	yeah
D	cos even now
D	when the gardens are a bit flat that there's lots to look at
C	do you think it's Elizabethan
C	I think it's prehistoric
D	medieval yeah
B	stone age I've heard
C	some parts of the house actually might be pretty old
D	yes
C	well see well see all these places are not all built erm at the same
D	same time no no
B	oh
D	oh
B	glad I was away
D	but er
B	yeah it was so nice we erm we went to this place called park
D	yes yes
B	and we booked a trip to
C	what do you want to?
D	oh yes
A	oh
B	cos we looked at the flights and we said if the flights are under fifty quid we'll all book a flight to
B	and they were fifty-three pounds so
D	mm yeah yeah
B	we booked it
A	ah cool
C	right do you want to hear the history?
D	mm mm
B	not really
D	yes I do please
C	so a community of Augustan canons built a priory here
C	known as
D	mm
C	and they got a bit of extra land in twelve seventy-nine anyway the canons were kicked out in fifteen thirty-five during the dissolution of monasteries
D	yes yes mm
C	so the former priory was
C	retaining a few arches from the original priory so it was
D	mm
B	abbey makes it sound like erm
C	and in the late
B	erm like Bath Abbey like a a cathedral or something doesn't it? rather than a house
D	mm yeah yes yes yes
C	so in the late eighteenth century the house was owned by sir George Downing the founder of Downing College in Cambridge
D	oh
C	further alterations to the building were carried out in eighteen sixty-one
D	yes eighteen
C	what? sixteen hundreds was
D	well when was the act of union? between sixteen 0 four wasn't it? when James the
C	I haven't got
B	don't know don't care
A	round roundabout
D	yes
C	let's have a look when Elizabeth the first reigned
A	yeah
C	I I'm doing Elizabeth the first dates
D	James the sixth of Scotland wasn't he? James the first of England was sixteen 0 four I think
C	it's no good asking me
B	that's good knowledge I've got not a clue on one date of any monarch
C	so she was the seventh of September fifteen thirty-three to the twenty-fourth of March Sixteen 0 three
D	yes that was sixteen
C	so it was changed around in the year sixteen hundred it was about but just just after and then it came Jacobian
D	mm mm mm and then it's Jacobian
C	then it's Jacobian then yeah what did you want to know the date of?
D	well er James the first he was sixteen 0 four that's what I said
A	yeah
C	oh
D	so that fits doesn't it?
B	one one point for you
A	mm
C	oh it's extra
D	you ought to know when the act of union between Scotland and England was
C	you want to know?
B	well it was all they were chatting about it last year weren't they? when there was all the independence
D	yeah yes they were but didn't you take it in?
B	no definitely didn't
C	no he was crowned on in sixteen 0 three actually
D	oh
C	so act of union
A	it was seventeen 0 seven wasn't it?
D	was it?
C	seventeen 0 seven blimey
D	oh
C	you know the dates very well
D	ah yeah
A	ah well it came up a lot
C	yeah
C	okay well
D	ah I thought I thought they were unified
C	was it? wasn't it?
D	under James
C	no
A	mm
B	I know it was a bit dodgy
C	no
D	no no well well
C	a hundred years later in fact
B	I know it was a bit dodgy wasn't it? the unification?
A	mm
D	yeah yeah
B	wasn't it by like one vote or something that they unified or?
C	mm
A	haven't heard that
D	mm
B	I heard that
C	I thought a lot of people got killed
B	I heard that from a Scottish person
D	mm
C	wasn't it the battle of Bannockburn or something like that?
D	yeah it was something no we yeah I I don't know
A	mm mm
D	I didn't do that bit of history we did chunks of history and the Tudors I knew
C	I didn't really even do that
D	but they then we missed it out and we started on Europe in the late eighteen hundreds
A	mm
D	and we missed the bit out
B	I like their architecture Georgian
D	yes yes
A	mm
D	for houses
B	mm
D	yes they look nice and comfortable roomed houses with big windows and
C	they're very erm very symmetrical
D	mm
B	and Edwardian are nice
D	mm yes and then you go into the the nineteen twenties and thirties and that
B	oh I like them as well
D	the thirties are pretty
B	I quite like them
C	I like thirties yeah it's fifties I don't particularly keen on
D	mm
C	thirties
D	the thirties houses are the typical semi detached like you get all all on that
C	mm I think they're okay
D	oh no I can't bear that one
C	my my French friend says you know? with the with the round erm doors porches
D	uh I can't bear it
C	she says it looks like a downturned mouth and she thinks they're really sad houses
D	ah
C	oh I love bay windows
D	mm
C	oh no I like bay windows
D	they're not somehow they're not bay windows like there's a erm
C	a different yeah around usually
D	no just
C	whereas this is
D	mm
B	just anything really
D	it's just that there's
C	yeah
D	and then rows and rows and rows and rows and rows and rows of them all the same
C	well that's yes well that was more the
D	oh no the the the
C	the fifties we were a poorer country
D	I mean they were there when I was er
C	yeah yeah no that's true
D	in the in much of my childhood you know?
C	yeah
B	well surely these
D	and you used to look at the semis and think er
B	really? but surely this is the same just rows and rows and rows
D	yeah it is but it isn't yes but I don't mind them somehow when they're terraced like that and
C	but we're not terraced
D	and the and the and they've got those nice oh the high ceilings they were all built all together lower
C	a lot of the twenties houses had high ceilings
D	twenties ah maybe
C	Edwardian had very high ceilings
B	I don't even know when they were
D	but in the twenties they went into depression and all that and thirties
C	well that's true
D	so they didn't build so much
C	oh I better go and put your fish on
B	how old was your house in
D	not not old eighteen forty-eight
B	I think that's old
C	but I thought it there was one part of it which was much much older?
D	well we I I thought that it was probably built on top of something else
C	I thought there was some bit that was like medieval almost
D	almost yes going
C	is it still thatched?
D	mm
D	no no no
C	oh right no I wouldn't want to live in a thatched house actually
D	well no because it in those days it cost twenty-eight thousand to rethatch
C	wow
D	you know? and if you got to do it
C	did you take the thatch off?
D	no
C	oh right
B	are you allowed to take the thatch off?
D	I probably not now
C	probably not in
D	if it's listed
D	but the people before us who built the bit on the back
C	no you I bet you're not allowed to now I mean if you're not even allowed to chop branches off trees here
D	mm I know
C	you're certainly not going to be allowed to
D	do away with thatch no
C	mm
B	but twenty-eight thousand pounds a year
D	no not a year
C	no no no no no
D	no it should last five or six years but you've got that hanging over you all the time
B	but is it like? does the thatch get mouldy?
C	yeah and insects get in your house
D	mm
C	and dust
D	and
B	I wouldn't want to live in a thatched house really
D	and then it starts then it starts to leak
C	if your asthma
D	but you can erm
D	you can have partial thatches that don't cost that's for a total thatching
A	mm
B	it looks nice
D	oh yes I know
A	oh yeah lovely thatched cottages in Dorset weren't there?
D	there's some lovely ones around
C	yeah
D	and I I would have loved to have one yes
A	mm
D	but
B	not with that money you could go on a mega holiday for all that money
D	I didn't mm
B	there's not much thatching in
A	well I haven't ever seen any of them no
B	no I've never thought of that before
C	too damn cold
D	mm
D	and they haven't got the er reed beds
B	oh
D	or probably reeds thatching
A	mm
B	oh so they would never have been made
D	cos they're cut in cut in Norfolk mainly
B	ah
D	is the chief thing that it produces thatching reed
C	Dorset must have some because well Dorset has a lot
D	yes yes mm
C	and Devon I think
A	mm
D	mm
C	probably Cornwall as well
D	yeah
A	would this now be recording what they are saying as well or
D	oh goodness me I don't want to be recorded then I must think I must talk nice
D	mustn't I?
B	talk however you wanna talk
A	mm
D	I don't want to be recorded as talking all Essex
D	like
C	yeah but you've never lived in Essex
D	no I know that's why the chap
C	but you haven't got an Essex accent
D	no I didn't think
C	there are some quite nice parts of Essex
D	he had a he had a very erm
C	oh very west country burr
D	not yeah
C	mm
A	oh I like west country
D	Essex I think is all pretty
C	I have huge problems if anyone asks me where I come from
A	well you come from
C	yeah but I yeah I don't really though do I?
D	mm
A	well I thought you did
C	yeah well where does
D	mm yes yes
A	yeah well I suppose she has to if she asks where she was born yeah
C	mm yeah
D	and er
A	mm
B	I think you should say
A	ah yeah well that's well that's quite different
B	because
D	yes well that's very different cos I
B	yeah
D	that's always home to me
C	I don't know where I identify with
D	and if I get off the plane in Africa even now I'm quite sure I'd
B	yeah
C	so where would you say you identify with?

A	no way I come from definitely
B	no but where?
D	oh well
B	what's? what's the place that you feel most at home?
D	mm yeah if you went off up into your ethereal spirit where? where would you go to?

D	I'd go to East Africa
A	well
D	because it doesn't the Africa I like doesn't exist anymore
C	no well I'd go to Cyprus before the
D	mm yeah yeah
A	oh
D	before they had all the
C	from like
