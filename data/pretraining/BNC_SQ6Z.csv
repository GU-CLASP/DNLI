B	yeah
D	you know it's just taking care
D	of all of this stuff like erm
B	oh okay so it's not
D	figuring things out but I think the the the it had been ruled like more or less in their favour well they got
D	which basically he said they offered him a lot of money to buy him out like he if he was smart he would've just taken it it was like a really good deal but he wanted more you know
D	he tried to like
B	who would do that?
D	he tried to I don't know exactly
