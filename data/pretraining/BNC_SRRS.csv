B	mm
A	I mean I am chained to the NHS for the next three years but that's obviously fine
B	most people do yeah
A	yeah
B	the NHS but then again people moan about the NHS but it's better than nothing
B	exactly
A	yeah
B	renewal price of the
A	yeah
B	AIDS tablet but at least the NHS stops that from happening well it doesn't stop it from happening but in the in cases like that
A	yeah
B	they pay for it don't they? or you pay like er an amount towards it
A	yeah
B	mm
A	but I don't even think you do well
B	you don't for cancer treatment stuff do you? you get all that on the NHS
A	you only have to pay for
B	prescriptions yeah
A	but er but if you're over sixty-five you get them for free anyway
B	yeah mm
A	and under
B	yeah er or full time education
A	yeah
B	mm
A	it's
B	yeah
A	like we were looking at the
B	yeah I remember you saying for that old woman
A	really expensive
B	didn't you say like two hundred pound per shot?
A	yeah per shot that's ridiculous
B	yeah
A	that's on the NHS
B	oh yay this is where all our bloody taxpayers' money goes
A	some old lady
B	some old biddy who doesn't even want the bloody thing
B	ah
A	that door is filthy
B	which one?
A	windows in the door
B	yeah yes it is
A	oh
B	the thing with this house though it's really hard to like make it look clean that
B	no
A	just tatty
B	yeah
A	all that look
B	I know yeah
B	and er I
A	oh no
B	I bet it's disgusting
A	it's just a tatty house though
B	I have a quick question
A	yeah?
B	where are you gonna put all your stuff when you move back home?
A	yeah I know
A	well that was it was gonna go in erm
B	mm
A	but then I don't know if that would
B	yeah
A	why?
B	you know when we were talking about bras?
B	I know and I turned round and
A	no I didn't mean it either
B	I felt awful afterwards
A	so did I I was thinking about that last night when I was in bed I was like oh my god
B	I know me too I wanted to message her and say well I'm so sorry er I didn't mean it was massive in a like you're massive
B	she's not at all
A	that's the thing that was the point
B	it just it sounds like thirty-eight sounds really big
A	sounds like it should be too big for you
B	I felt so horrendous
A	so did I I felt really
B	I was like oh no
A	really awkward
B	yeah when I said it I was like shit I did not mean it like that
B	but it's not it clearly is just like
A	then we just started to
B	dig our grave yeah
A	oh
B	I really would like to apologise but then I
B	I know
A	it's so cringy
B	cos not even my mum is a thirty-eight
A	no
B	mum's thirty-six
B	exactly like
B	no no
A	that sounded
B	yeah
A	she didn't look like she should be a thirty-eight
B	thirty-eight yeah exactly yeah
A	that was the that was the thing
B	that was the point
A	we just weren't explaining ourselves very well
B	no no
A	we were explaining ourselves way too much
A	oh did she?
B	she got told by her erm company that they weren't gonna sponsor her to stay in the country so she has to go back next year you know she wanted to try and stay
A	shit
B	and then
A	oh
B	yeah
A	oh
B	not just likes him but is like in like
A	I always wondered whether there was something
B	yeah I think I think there always was something like I know er she's spoken to me about it before and she has admitted that she's had like a crush on him and stuff but she was like I think I actually love him I'm like oh god okay
A	does he reciprocate the feeling?
B	I don't know I'm really confused about it because he does everything
A	they seem to like be a couple almost
B	they are they're a couple without like the sex essentially
A	yeah
B	and like he does things for her like buys her like stuff when he's out you know like buys her like her favourite cake or like cupcake when she's out or er for her birthday he bought her a scratch map that she yeah that he got in
A	see when I heard that I was like oh
B	yeah exactly but then I kind of think
B	but I would do the same for like like on Saturday we're surprising her by taking her to the theatre
A	yeah
B	but because it's girls you it doesn't mean the same thing does it?
A	no
B	but it's because it's him doing it
A	true oh
B	yeah
B	and then when he went out to this waffle house the other
B	but then you're like but if I did like
A	yeah
B	but if it's a boy doing it it's like
A	yeah but
B	oh he's thinking about me
A	but boys don't but then okay
B	boys don't do that
A	boys don't do that do they?
B	no
A	and boys don't think about people that they don't give a shit about
B	exactly and like that's the thing though but and also you like you know me I'm a firm believer that if he likes her he would've he would get with her
A	mm
B	he'd go there
A	mm
B	and he hasn't might not want
A	they need to have it out they need to have this discussion
B	they do I said that to her yesterday cos I was like you've got another nine months of this like if if
A	it's gonna be absolute torture
B	do you think yeah do you think you can actually do it? and she was like well yeah I've done it before I'm like yeah but
A	how long have they been living
B	mm since last January time so nearly yeah eight months nine months
A	are they friends from like school?
B	no no they she's friends with his sister
A	oh okay
B	and then she met
A	oh okay
B	so
A	oh
B	he's also dating this girl
A	yeah
B	mm yeah like he's dating like three people at once or two people at once
B	until she goes?
A	yeah
B	yeah cos he's away
A	but he'll be in
B	yeah but he is with his brother and like well he's with the lads he's with a group of lads on a lads' tour
A	and that might make him think when he when he comes back cos this is what happened to
B	oh god what's wrong with men?
A	I don't know
A	mm
B	you know she has no right to get annoyed with him cos they're not going out but I worry that if they do start going out or or if something does happen and then he does something she'll then get annoyed about it
A	she might
A	or you'd hope that it was
B	make them stronger
A	smooth transition
B	could be
A	ah poor
B	mm
A	who erm where does she what company does she work for?
B	don't know just a small one in town
B	yeah they were like we really want you to stay but they have to to sponsor somebody it's not the financial side they have the problem with it's the side that if you sponsor someone to stay in the UK you have to open up the job invite people to apply for it and then the person who wants the
A	oh god
B	so to apply so what they have to do is make
B	and well they just don't know how many people are gonna
A	what is what's her job title?
B	I
A	mm
B	I don't know but they er they said like
A	she might get lost
B	yeah
A	oh
B	not that they they
A	no no no on a work level yeah
B	just on a work or experience level she'd get lost
A	yeah
B	so it's really
A	could she apply for anything else?
A	mm
B	and I don't really know moving somewhere else for nine months is er is a good idea
A	but if she wants to stay it might be the thing to do
B	mm
A	didn't realise it was so complicated
B	yeah I know it's ridiculous it's so complicated and I was thinking like for relationships and stuff how how er complicated it must be but I don't think it is I think you can get something like erm if you're like in a
A	what does
A	ah
B	so he has a dual passport
B	well she's actually half Italian but
A	oh
B	they moved too long before she was born to get the or when no actually she might've been like one or two when she was when they moved over and so they didn't
A	yeah
B	she couldn't get them yeah she couldn't get the dual nationality or something
A	mm
B	and I think one of her siblings has had a dual nationality passport but she doesn't
A	really?
B	yeah
B	so
A	she needs to get married to him
B	that's what we were like we were like
A	well what if he's faced with the dilemma that she has to leave? surely he will cos he he doesn't know that does he?
B	yeah he
B	well no he doesn't know that she has to leave but he's kind of like when you leave I'll probably leave or I'll go somewhere else or but apparently like he wants to live like in other places he might move to the US and stuff like
A	okay
B	she's kind of doesn't think that he thinks further ahead than like when he when he's in a relationship with
A	mm
B	she's right there and the only thing you're not getting from
A	mm
B	you know and then you would be in a proper relationship like everything you would get from a girlfriend is what he already gets from
A	tried
B	tried or even like
A	yeah
B	they have such a good relationship it's just so stupid
A	that is stupid poor
B	ah
B	my parents normally call me and I always think it's bad news and actually it's something stupid like
B	I always get really sinister phone calls when they're like
B	and it's just like
B	yeah it's serious could you call me quickly please? right I'm in a shop so I want something
A	hello yes thanks
