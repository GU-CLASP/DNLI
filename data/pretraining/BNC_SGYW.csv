A	there's BBC News
B	mm
A	bBC4 is good
B	mm
A	you get intelligent programmes on that
B	mm
A	iTV4 or whatever
B	yeah
A	but there's not much
B	yesterday has one thing interesting perhaps a day or
A	I think er but you have to like with everything
B	and Film4
A	you have to scan and and
B	but no the point is you know there's like a hundred odd channels isn't there
A	yeah
B	and they're all just crap aren't they
A	oh yeah
B	most of them  most of them  You know and the even in the daytime you still can't find anything to watch
A	I but I'm thinking of kids
B	mm
A	plus film channels they they subscribe to
B	yeah
A	must spend their whole lives watching TV
B	I suppose
A	some people do don't they
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	there's always that chatshow crap in the morning and
A	yeah
B	then it sort of settles down a bit
A	they don't really give you more choice do they
B	it doesn't really give yeah
A	Mid-morning if you want to watch something serious
B	exactly
B	er you know the
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	all very old
A	that't it
B	stick to pretty much the same format
B	mm
A	no
B	nine A M
B	yeah
A	or not
B	but you've like you know documentaries you know that er er that's
A	yeah
B	isn't it
A	it's all about Hitler
B	yeah
A	it should be called the Hitler channel
A	it is isn't it
B	film Five should be called like is it Film Five or something? The Steven Seagal channel
A	yes
B	lethal Weapon
A	and
B	lethal Weapon or
A	Jurassic Park on ITV1
B	Jurassic Park
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	like Stardust was on a
A	what's that one?
B	er it's sort of like a
A	is it like NeverEnding Story?
B	it's a bit like that
B	A bit more updated
A	I guess they buy the rights to certain films
B	I suppose so
A	don't they
B	yes
A	so they you know show it as much as possible
B	as much as they
A	fill up the schedule
B	yeah
A	with something isn't it
B	and and then it kind of and then they replace it with something else and then it comes back again
B	who
A	iTV3 always play Poirot
B	yeah
B	and then
A	your heart would stop if you watched all of it
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	oh yeah I know
B	have you ever watched well well
A	that's in Battersea that
B	is it?
A	it's next to Battersea Park
B	oh
A	where the Observer newspaper used to be
B	oh yeah
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	mm
A	and black building
B	yeah but who you know do
A	I dunno
B	mm yeah
A	yeah that was quite interesting for a while
B	but then you know but you know wouldn't you go to the garden centre?
A	well to be honest
B	I
A	I I get much more entertainment from the internet
B	mm
A	like videos
B	yeah
A	Cos cos because you can be in control
B	sure
A	you can watch something on YouTube
B	yeah
A	you can pause it
B	yeah
A	I find TV too passive
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	yeah
B	there's nothing you can do
A	but I think most people nowadays find the internet much more
B	yeah
A	for news and video
B	mm
A	like I don't  I don't I don't  wait for the six o'clock news to get news
B	and and and and that's what I mean
A	no
B	thing has it
A	yeah
B	four screens at once
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	and that it's still plodding along with its traditional
A	they were talking about putting internet on the TV weren't they
B	that would be quite useful
A	you can stream it to your
B	that would be quite useful
A	yeah
B	put it inside our heads
A	thought control
B	and those yeah well you're not er
A	some countries like Korea seem to be want that don't they
B	mm
A	they get very frustrated with the speed of the internet
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	well why don't you look out the window for five minutes?
A	you know
A	nobody sends letters in Korea
B	no
A	Cos nobody has the patience to sit down and
B	I suppose not
A	and then  and then  go and buy a stamp
B	yeah
A	there must be
B	there are  there are  but not not like we have them here
A	every street corner
B	not these days
A	you have to go to you have to make a special trip to a post office?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	some countries are like that
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	sign and their postbox outside and the postman
B	mm
B	Cos most people don't
A	that's part of the fun
B	find it first
B	with a a big hat on
A	yeah
B	it's funny cos I we do do you remember
B	at your your
A	yes
B	well yeah there's probably quite a few
A	many
A	yeah
B	I dunno
A	there were three together
B	oh
B	I met er one one time she was asking me
A	oh yes
B	well
A	hey hey hey
A	did she really ask you that? Er
B	well she sort of said what do you no not that quite like that
A	did she know your wife was Korean
B	I can't remember if I suppose she might
A	or maybe or I think it was Korea or Japan
B	I guess so
A	because they they've had more um democracy for longer and
B	I think so
A	the the the what do you call it? The cosmopolitanism of the people
B	right
A	and the sophistication of the people
B	okay
B	and I think if you look at that sort of they were in the same war as us
A	yeah
B	you know
A	but it's easy to explain because Japan's generation went through the sixties
B	yeah
A	they had the Korean War in the fifties
B	it's a  it's a  bit of a kind of
A	they had a
B	yep
A	so there you're talking about two generations who've been
B	so in terms of culture
A	through the pop culture
B	pop culture
A	more in common with people
B	more sort of common ground
A	that's what it's that includes
B	sorry?
A	you didn't say that to her
B	no
A	that would've been my explanation
B	er I think so
A	yeah yeah yeah yeah
B	but I mean it's difficult to sort of say there's one one
A	you can't generalize
B	reason
A	yeah
B	I mean there's probably quite a
A	mm
B	village
A	yeah
B	they're they're interested in these type of things aren't they
A	very very English
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	you know
A	yeah
B	which you don't often find with
A	she said that? Oh no
A	denigrate your own her own nation
B	I I should explain the
A	those were her words
B	I'd just introduced her to the term savages
A	oh no
B	Cos she was on about um
A	oh
B	and I said yeah savages
A	oh no
B	to
A	maybe she thinks of it in terms of country bumpkin
B	well you see
A	she mean uncouth or
B	A a lot of Koreans are really rough
A	ah
B	really you know once you go outside of Seoul
A	mm
B	de de de de de are are very
A	Small? Unsophisticated?
B	no you know there's a lot of when you're actually there
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	like in
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	I often had students going oh yeah the quality of those people is not good
B	oh okay
A	what do you mean the quality is not good? And they meant things like you know people who spit on pavements and
B	mm
A	shout in restaurants and
B	mm
A	elbow
B	and there's a lot of that
A	yeah
B	they don't have the kind of and I suppose
A	it does doesn't it
B	and like
A	yeah
B	so we had some Japanese guy I think I I've said to you
A	Japan's the other extreme isn't it
B	yeah
B	he brought round a box of um he was coming round to look at some of
A	oh right clothes yeah
B	and he came round and he brought sort of
A	samples
B	yeah a box of rice crackers
A	oh
B	and it was wrapped up
A	wrapped
B	and tied up
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	and perfect
A	but but but that's it's but it's interesting that you say that because the
B	mm
A	even though they've got all this war history and they they
B	yeah
A	they don't like that side of things
B	mm
A	cultured societies
B	and and and so like
A	yeah
B	things like this as well can't we
A	mm
B	there are you know we do like to do little nice little quaint things don't we
A	yeah
B	and I think the Japanese
A	quaint
B	quite like
A	yeah
B	and um but quaint and Korea don't really sit comfortably together
B	you know
A	loud
B	you know eating is what
A	yeah
B	you know get to go and be loud
A	which some people might find refreshing
B	sure
A	er you know
B	well
A	reserved and
B	exactly
A	Down to everything is down to earth
B	exactly
A	yeah
B	get stuck in and they don't care about
A	but your wife doesn't see it as down to earth?
B	um she well she's kind of like I I think
A	embarrassed by it?
B	I don't know
A	she gets very self-conscious about
B	I suppose er I suppose well it's like you know when you go away from your
A	just it's like seeing British tourists in the south of Spain
A	yeah
B	you know
A	ordering fish and chips and
B	stand outside
A	yeah
B	of your culture
A	yeah
B	you know I suppose once you're there you don't notice it
A	or Americans watching American tourists abroad
B	yeah
A	yeah yeah yeah yeah
B	you know
A	and you think oh my God are we really like that?
B	yeah
A	yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
B	yeah
A	it's yeah it's understandable
B	yeah
A	no that's good
B	it is
A	means she means she's very aware isn't she
B	yeah
A	Cos some people are totally unaware of that
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	she was in in Melbourne
A	yeah
B	and just carry on as if they're in Korea
A	as if they're in Korea
B	you know
A	wow
B	what of how they
A	Cos they've been such a homogenized nation for so long
B	I suppose
A	yeah
B	themselves
A	they don't see other people as sort of
B	they don't
A	mm
B	Cos when you go to a restaurant they don't care who's there there there you know
A	yeah
B	and that's it
A	not curious about anything
B	they're not
A	yeah
B	not curious and not but not also not inhibited by people
A	no
B	either
A	mm
B	you know so you know like I said you know we're always a bit sort of self-conscious
B	you know they're they're just nothing to them
A	really
B	and that's kind of good in a way but also a bit weird
A	no but it's a
B	mm
A	like it's like you say the family bubble
B	mm
A	are the people are non-persons
B	yes
A	almost
B	yes
A	there's no
B	mm
A	consciousness of the
B	no
A	wider community isn't it
B	and and and I sometimes feel that I'm part of one of those non-persons
A	mm
A	mm
B	often when he goes to Japan
A	mm
B	he's the kind of
A	the outsider
B	the person who doesn't really you don't need to figure in these decisions
A	even though you're family
B	or and he's black as well
A	oh really? That's
B	so he kind of doesn't really
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	prejudice aren't they
B	yeah
A	skin colour and
B	yeah
A	that's yeah that must be interesting
B	so it's it it's and it is funny you know like I said about the the whole education thing
A	and what I find most sad is lack of curiosity
B	mm
A	Cos I think certain times in my in I mean it happens everywhere but in er every culture
B	mm
A	and ways of doing things
B	mm
A	and
B	mm
A	in this sort of bubble
B	mm
A	so the lack of awareness
B	mm
A	just astounding actually
B	it is
A	mm
B	you know having the history that they've had you know like with their
A	they've always been in in between Japan and
B	exactly
A	China
B	you know
A	mm
B	colonized and
A	mm
B	and they banned their like their hairstyle and their writing and things like this
A	the national psyche
B	exactly
A	mm
B	and and
A	so what was
B	I don't think so
A	but how did she know? Cos you can't that's a bit of an assumption to make isn't it
B	I think that I well I dunno
A	that's what she observed?
B	I suppose so
A	in the street
B	yeah
A	mm
A	it's funny because they they often complained about teachers to me
B	did they?
A	they  they didn't like  they didn't like um the New Zealand girl
B	okay
A	but she was they felt she wasn't good enough to teach them
B	yeah
A	and you get students coming to you and you think oh I don't like her I don't
B	there was a South African guy that they used to
A	oh yeah
B	more as well
A	he was late all the time
B	was he?
B	you see er but see
A	he was bad
B	was he?
B	you have no idea what they saying about
A	I know
B	Cos they you know
A	yeah
B	you kind of think oh you know I I appreciate your you know sort of
A	candour
B	er er and and you know that you're sharing this information with me
A	yeah
B	you kind of do wonder about
A	it's awkward isn't it
B	Cos I remember the er like I cos I know that Koreans er er er again they've got a particular idea of what is you know they're not  they're not  flexible
A	yeah
B	they're not kind of
B	on the you know in a  in a  dialogue situation
A	she wanted you to write it down?
B	well she wanted yeah
A	oh no
B	yeah
A	thinking far too logically about it
B	exactly
B	no it's because they do everything by memory don't they
A	yeah
B	they want to memorise everything
A	oh yeah
B	and the guy said hello my name is duh duh duh
A	blank stare
B	and he just
A	er
B	looked at his piece of paper and what right hang on the
A	oh really? Huh
B	that's not the response that
A	mm
B	and they want to have these
A	dialogues
B	dialogues
A	yeah
B	that they can just memorise and
A	that is the problem with dialogues in books
B	yeah
A	they don't reflect er real er
B	not at all
A	life
B	no
A	often
B	no
A	is Korean more formulaic?
B	well
A	yeah
B	that you know you see it all the time in
A	well certain languages might be more formulaic
B	some might languages might
A	yeah
B	and I wondered if er Italian's a bit like so when they answer the phone it's always er
A	well they are cos
A	yeah yeah cos in
B	okay
A	to strangers that you don't use with or
B	okay
A	something like that
B	right
A	but in some cultures yeah you don't use certain words
B	no I'd say not
A	there are
B	yeah
A	fixed in some than others
B	yeah
A	so you know
B	like when they're on
A	yeah
B	italians on the telephone
A	ah
B	and it's quite and and and I don't think I've ever heard anyone speak on a phone who hasn't said that
A	mm
B	at the beginning of a conversation
B	you know
A	in Japan they say
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	duh duh duh duh
A	in China you would say wait wait
B	okay
A	but in England you don't have to say that
B	ah yeah
A	er
B	yeah
A	yep
B	oh okay
A	what's up?
B	but I mean more than just the initial it it's more than just the initial kind of greeting
A	mm
B	it's the kind of like you know hi
A	mm
B	or rather than
A	mm
B	you know or  you know or  hello
A	yeah
B	or hi
A	there still are things that are inappropriate though aren't there
B	yeah
A	to your boss
B	yeah
A	or er
B	yeah
A	doesn't exist in English but it's different it's it's er
B	yes
A	you have to learn the convention don't you
B	I think so
A	for the language
B	and I  and I  would say there's a lot I dunno  I dunno
A	er the those people are probably
B	I just just have a feeling
A	probably translating their formal convention into English
B	right
A	so the Korean learner was trying to maybe in Korean you can learn some formulaic phrases
B	perhaps so
A	in English
B	and that's what I mean
A	yeah
B	perhaps in service transaction okay there are  there are  formed
A	yeah
B	there is a
A	like can I help you? Yeah
B	yeah
A	but also the student is not aware of how language works
B	right
A	no matter what background they're from
B	mm
A	can you write down some sentences for me? And then they
B	mm
A	they get the same problem
B	yeah
A	so it might not be a problem with the language background of the person
B	mm
A	and that could be from any cultural background
B	true
A	you know
B	and indeed it's also a a a mistake that coursebook writers make themselves
A	yeah
B	and I was thinking today about about this you know how we we we give students a list of words or phrases and we say okay now I want you to put those into a dialogue
A	mm
B	forgetting that the dialogue is actually interactive
A	negotiated
B	what depends on what I say and depends and so we we might have these phrases but we're never gonna get them into the dialogue
A	yeah
B	Informs the next part
A	mm
B	yeah
B	there are
B	yeah
A	but it's like the lesson sequencing isn't it
B	now use it
A	free practice
B	yeah
A	and it is artificial in that way
B	it is because the free practice isn't really that free
B	went cinema
A	I never corrected much though in
B	I didn't
A	because it doesn't work
B	no
A	something's not happened in their  in their  cognition
B	yeah
A	to to recognise it as a mistake
B	yes
A	and that's
B	well that's that's the fault of the
A	you you're not gonna correct it by orally correcting it
B	I don't think so
A	mm
B	manifestations is that you know okay er you can try it now to do practice and hope that they integrate those
A	mm
B	but to
A	Cos it always seems quite laboured doesn't it
B	yeah
A	that's why I gave up on a lot of the techniques
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	and it's not effective
A	it's just it's not working is it
B	yeah
A	so you're thinking hang on a minute I must be doing something wrong here
B	yes
A	you know
B	no that's quite an interesting way of putting it
A	yeah
B	there's nothing wrong with hard work
A	no
B	yeah
A	but
B	yeah
A	it's you know when you're it's like beating your head against a wall
B	yeah
A	and you you
B	yeah
A	it hurts and you're not doing anything
B	no
A	you're just hurting yourself
B	and and a lot of the time er the students don't even pick up on those differences
A	yeah
B	it's
A	oh yeah
B	does it  does it  really inhibit meaning? And he said well no of course not
A	it just doesn't sound right
B	and so what really is if you're  if you're  focusing on sort of trying to get meaning out what's the point in banging on
A	yeah
B	their heads because they make a small grammatical error? Oh
A	Cos you listen to people like at your um tut you know if you listen I listen to the World Service a lot
B	mm
A	who are non-native English speakers
B	yeah
A	but it it hasn't
B	yeah
A	it it doesn't detract
B	no not at all
A	at all
B	not at all
A	they've got a wonderful vocabulary
B	yeah
A	they can understand a hundred
B	yeah
A	a hundred percent of what they are
B	yeah
A	listening to
B	yeah
A	mistakes
B	yeah
A	so does it matter that they don't
A	yeah
B	mm
A	miss the S off now and again
B	exactly
A	or
B	and how many times have you seen that on you know they say okay put an S in the corner of the board and a square round it
A	oh I haven't seen that
B	it's a
A	oh really?
B	and students
A	I haven't seen that method
B	oh teacher
A	ah
B	ah
A	you don't beat him with a stick
B	he like
B	not the first time
B	ah
A	oh yeah
B	okay
A	and this goes on and on  and on and on
B	matches
B	or break it over your head
A	oh right
B	yeah
A	if they're not hearing it they're not gonna correct themselves are they
B	and and the thing is no sure
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	you know
B	the they they're not thinking about oh but he missed an S off
A	unless that's
B	unless er yes unless that's what you're there for
A	no
B	oh
A	I mean it was so obvious because they would  they would  not hear it
B	okay
A	like I'd play the tape like or the CD like with them three or four times and none of them could hear what what they were not hearing
B	oh
A	missing an S
B	which is gonna always gonna be problematic
A	yeah
B	in English isn't it
A	but the the the how I mean no matter how many times I played it
B	mm
A	they just couldn't hear it
B	say say say for
A	he he he goes
B	yeah
A	they they would write he go
B	okay
A	um
B	think of a kind of fairly long sentence
A	he er usually goes to the supermarket on Wednesdays and Thursdays to buy
B	goes
A	the Z  the Z  sound is there
B	but that's a voiced sound isn't it
A	yeah
B	okay
A	it's always voiced isn't it? He goes
B	yeah
A	oh I'm sorry
B	is unvoiced is it
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	so
A	because he likes  he likes
B	he likes to watch
A	Cos it is a very soft S S
B	exactly
A	hiss sound
B	then it's possible that it's um
A	yeah
B	missable isn't it
A	ah
B	I dunno  I dunno
A	he likes
B	Cos he's sort of thinking that
A	yeah
B	ah my sister she really likes to go um
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	and the other one which always flummoxed them was the um I have been when it was contracted
B	I been
A	I be
B	I be
A	I be
B	no
A	yeah
B	but you can  you can  retrieve the meaning
A	but it er changes the whole tense
B	it it does but I mean you can retrieve meaning from I been really can't you
A	yeah
B	where is where the stress is
A	that's true
B	I be
A	that's true
B	I've been
A	and if you say the time I be there
B	yeah
A	no if you're using present imperfect you wouldn't say the date though would you
B	yeah
A	I've been there yesterday
B	ah
A	yeah
B	I've been hundreds of times
A	I be
B	I be
A	or I've been
B	no
A	mm
