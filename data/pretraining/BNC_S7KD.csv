B	all of them to search
A	to search you so it's just got it's like they're doing it they'll do it like regularly now but it's only a soft search and it won't affect your credit rating but at the time when you see it and I got the alert for it I didn't realise that
B	mm
A	so I was like oh my god it's happened all over again cos there was ones on there that I didn't even know who they were
