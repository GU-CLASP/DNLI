B	I'm getting up to thirty now
A	it's it's yeah it's like
C	I still can't believe
B	what? I know I've got
A	there's a grey two greys
B	I've got a few greys
B	I've got a few like blond and like really white hairs
A	but
B	I hope I just go a defined grey
A	oh you'll do a do a Richard are you going to do a Richard Gere?
C	it's very
A	you can have one if you want one?
B	I'll have a couple of pulls
C	I think it's very distinguished on a man
B	mm
A	no
C	no because I like the grey
A	no because he's like he's um what's he? he's a Mel Gibson
A	always think of
C	yeah
A	what about your dad? has he gone grey?
B	ah he's just losing it
A	oh it's gone on top
B	he's still got it but
C	not his hair he's just losing it
B	just losing the plot in general
A	like
B	oh they're engaged
A	yeah
C	getting married is it this year?
A	no next year yeah since he met
B	mm
A	there was one occasion last year or was it the year before
B	what?
A	because I was sitting near and and she has the first wife syndrome
B	no come on
A	that's what we call it
B	so she's quite jealous? protective?
A	insecure
B	yeah insecure
A	and you know
B	neurotic
A	yeah and all that stuff so erm there was a big hoo ha and the kids in there said
B	yeah
A	I've never had anything against
B	do you see him ever?
C	no
A	but there's too many things that have happened
B	seems like whenever there's a divorce the man just doesn't just loses all contact with the rest of the family altogether
A	I think he finds it hard
B	I mean who has contact with my dad? nobody
A	eh?
B	I was just saying who has contact with dad nobody absolutely nobody
A	no no nobody on our side do they? this is what happens the family divides it's horrible it really is horrible
B	mm
C	I think unless the two people stay friends unless there's no animosity unless there's like no bad feeling
A	his brother
C	then you can still interlock the families
A	him him
B	I mean when does is ever end amicably? it doesn't it doesn't
C	no
A	it does it can do
B	It can do but
C	no but over a period of time it's like you know your dad and I talk
A	well bitterness sets in
A	yeah but you can't sit down like I couldn't and and at a family do and have a laugh with his new eh erm wife or him with
C	I don't know I think now that we could I think now we could be civil enough to each other
A	I don't think you could
C	I could why would you say I couldn't?
B	with dad?
C	yeah
A	well I mean you could but I I just think I think you'd get irritated
C	well maybe yeah
A	if you're being honest you would get irritated
C	yeah yeah
B	I mean only last time I was home there was a whole bunch of crap wasn't there?
C	oh god but that was two years ago let's forget that
B	I know I know
C	it's done and gone and sorted
A	yeah but we're not bothered we're just generally talking about the whys and wherefore it happened and I think
C	you know I've chatted to your dad
A	I think there's irritation involved by one party oh god you know winds me up look what he's doing
A	or it could be the other way you know and then there's
C	but when I look at
B	yeah I know of course
C	when I look at
A	that's good that's wonderful
C	and now the in-laws have stayed friends
A	I take my hat off to people that can do it really really do
B	seems to be that ten percent doesn't it?
C	but then
A	I mean if I saw
B	yeah
C	yeah definitely
A	because it's like all those years
B	he's just
C	course you would course you would
A	I think what happens is when when it divides like when a marriage breaks and it divides you you pick up new roots with a new part of a family don't you?
B	yeah yeah
A	like you have with
B	and I know he didn't move far but it makes a difference he's not in the same area at all so you're not really just going to bump into him I guess unless he's at work
A	well I mean I was in Aldis the other day
B	really?
C	he was in there as well?
A	yeah with
C	ah no way that's his daughter
B	they don't speak
A	oh yeah
C	oh god
A	and
C	he needs to sort that out he needs to do something about it
A	well he won't he won't and the kids don't want me to blast him or be involved or anything so I don't
C	no no
A	no
B	are they?
C	and when you do you only get blamed for things so
A	oh yeah well he did he first of all he blamed the children
B	yeah cos she lived there didn't she for a while?
A	yeah
unknown_female	mm
B	it wasn't wasn't easy
A	yeah she wasn't gonna move out she was like she's not kicking me out of my home
B	are the girls being direct and honest with him? or are they?
A	yeah in fact they've gone in there
B	yeah?
A	and they've said dad what's the matter with you?
C	but he's kind of like you know I've been your father for thirty-three years I've done my bit
A	I've been your father
B	yeah I'm done it's time to move on
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	it is kind of like you're adults now

C	he used to know all of them didn't you?
C	yeah he is
A	and er
C	darling can you keep that in there because
A	kids should be heard and not seen
A	that's what we were told years ago
A	but erm yeah he's obviously sad
C	you're being so good
A	I mean
B	oh nice yeah he found himself a job pretty quickly didn't he?
A	yeah yeah
B	after that he sorted himself out and like yeah
A	he's just a fabricator which is good erm you know it's er it's er and he's working and he's bringing a wage in he's been there for over a year now and he's
C	he ballooned up didn't he?
B	yeah has he lost weight again?

A	yeah he's er
B	good stuff
C	that's good
A	he's just got pregnant well she got pregnant
A	she put on four stone
B	yeah
A	er
C	I put three stone on with all three of you
B	you looked terrible just before you gave birth I'm
A	well she but she was like that with er
C	I was I did have erm
B	you were scary
C	I had diabetes
B	yeah
C	towards the end
B	just what? you just get temporary diabetes?
C	yeah
A	she was huge with
B	yeah
A	you don't remember that but she was like this you know the oh with
C	I was I was like I had a little washing machine in my belly
B	it's weird her hands were swollen her face was swollen
C	yeah I was yeah I was but I did didn't I? just towards the end I swelled up everywhere
B	you looked like nan
A	yeah yeah what was it?
C	gestational diabetes it's called
A	yeah
C	that's just through pregnancy
B	lovely
A	so
C	some women get it I mean it doesn't it's not age dependent it's pregnancy dependent
B	there's loads of stuff you get from pregnancy isn't there that lingers and just carries on forever sounds horrible
C	well that didn't thank goodness
B	no yeah
A	but yeah so the situation now is I mean there was er
B	mm
A	er and I said er
A	and there's been so many situations which have left you with your er has left us with our mouth hanging er open
B	yeah how can he do that?
C	do you think if
A	no cos
C	oh god you wished you hadn't even tried
A	yeah cos his face you know says it all
C	mm
B	so
A	when you're let down by your parents in any shape or form
B	if he had a different partner would it be different?
A	yes ah course
C	yeah
B	so it's all her it's all
A	no it's half him isn't it
B	I mean of course it's him as well but
C	it's it's being erm I think it's erm
A	she's not good
C	if you're a weak person emotionally that way I think you can be led by the woman that you're with or the man that you're with
A	I always say with
C	no
A	at all and I always say and she will you will say erm you know have you rang
C	er supporting them
A	yeah supporting
C	mm
A	what you should and shouldn't do at times make the effort cos men I think can sometimes just go after the easy life
C	life's hectic and busy
B	or huh I think not necessarily myself but we're more black and white
unknown_female	mm
B	less emotionally attached
A	and I think er you've got a good
B	so maybe he is just thinking I I raised them I did my job and
A	they know where I am
B	now I need to focus on my partner now because if I don't have my partner I guess he's thinking he needs somebody
A	yeah
B	and he can't
A	and I think
B	and he's been put in a position where he goes
C	yeah but can't you have both?
B	well normally you'd think yeah but maybe this lady's giving him an ultimatum and he's thinking
unknown_female	mm
B	I'm no spring chicken I can't find some other lady so
A	with
C	I mean we had touches of it didn't we? with dad our dad she wasn't the right influence on dad to encourage him to keep our relationship going now
B	is that
A	well one she's racist for god's sake
unknown_female	yeah
unknown_female	yeah
A	they used to tell me we wouldn't have a black man in our factory
C	mm
B	that's terrible
A	and I er oh and loads of things but yeah unfortunately he's with somebody that isn't really supporting him in the right way and encouraging him and talking about things
B	so is it?
C	you see if that was
A	yeah
B	so no of course so the girls are frank with with
C	yeah
A	oh god yeah
B	they will tell her straight what are you doing to my family?
unknown_female	yeah yeah
A	when they last went round because he chucked
A	erm
A	and ringing her and er you know silly things
unknown_female	it's always silly not important stuff
A	oh you know er if if it was raining and
B	just petty
A	yeah
unknown_female	mm
B	stuff that you just think what? and she and she noticed it and she knew what was going on erm and they didn't speak for about six months when she in the last six months so
B	mum said she was living there and they weren't speaking
A	yeah erm and erm
C	just so sad
unknown_female	mm
A	and having some contact with his other children
C	or trying to sort it out with all of them
A	he chose to erm put all his efforts into her because she was the one with the insecurities and needed his time and everything
B	yeah
A	and erm
C	I mean you can understand if you've got a woman that's kind of like erm I'm not happy with this and your children think that and your children say this and you know the man would be saying thinking oh my goodness I can't cope with this
A	yeah but isn't it up to them to work it out?
B	which path is easier?
C	yeah what do I do? my kids are grown up they've got their lives I need to yeah but there are men that think that way
B	yeah I mean in my eyes
C	mm yeah
A	yeah
B	I would never do that but
A	yeah no exactly
B	then I'm taking the weaker path and choosing not to have children in the first place so
A	I mean look
C	at the moment
A	you you and
unknown_female	mm
A	towards
C	mm
A	because he loves you
C	mm
A	because when he takes on you he takes on
C	yeah definitely
unknown_female	yeah
A	and when you take
unknown_female	yeah definitely
A	and that's how it works
B	I mean
A	hello? is it difficult? no
B	well I mean briefly we still had a point where mum basically gave me an ultimatum about when we were at
unknown_female	oh yeah yeah
B	lump it or leave and I wasn't gonna lump it so I left so I mean at the same time you were you were basically saying
C	it wasn't quite like that
B	I mean we got into an argument and you kicked me out but I wasn't gonna live with
C	no
B	I didn't want to
A	mm
B	and you were you were gonna
C	well you weren't living with me full time
B	it didn't matter that I was like
C	you weren't you weren't living there full time
B	no I wasn't
C	you were going to uni
B	I I have no no bother about it now I'm just saying
unknown_female	mm
B	like objectively
A	no you just you just remember it
B	yeah
A	and yeah and you made the choice
B	and to me it felt like an ultimatum
A	it was like I don't want to
C	I can remember we had a very upsetting both of us were upset conversation and I was saying how I felt you were saying how you felt
B	yeah

B	I didn't realise that
C	yeah
A	in the whole country?
B	the whole country yeah
B	oh I was reading statistics and it was like twenty twenty percent was Italian
A	wow no I didn't know that in the whole country I would have thought perhaps

C	no
B	I mean there might be more people in
C	maybe it's something to do with erm didn't they come over for the the works?
B	for the yeah all
A	yeah it's like it's like eh the Jamaicans did in the fifties
C	yeah
A	same with the Italians same with the Irish
C	yeah
B	it might be erm obviously
A	a lot of the Irish went to America too
B	there were probably more Italians in
A	it's
C	probably got a
A	but a lot of the Italians a lot of the Italians came to England a lot of them went to America
B	yeah

B	mm
A	oh you're driving?
C	yeah
B	mm
C	well he's driving I'm sleeping
A	oh I bet you're looking forward to going?
C	I'm starting to I'm just starting to my bag is packed finally so
A	I'll give it twenty-four hours and you'll feel good
B	so when did you?
C	I'll feel tired in twenty-four hours
A	so you picked
B	Saturday night
C	Saturday at eight yeah well eight we were there
A	oh my god and you're going now I bet you're like feeling you can't wait to go but like ah your son's home
C	I know I am mixed yeah I am mixed
B	at least you picked me up the original plan was I was going to go to dad's and she was going to see me for a half an hour on the Monday and that was it
C	because because you were only going to come for the day today no it wasn't it was going to be for the day
B	yeah
C	we weren't supposed to be leaving until midnight
A	that's revolting did you say?
B	yeah I did I told her like six months ago
A	what's what's going on mother?
B	I told her like six months ago but
C	yeah but I didn't see a way I didn't see a way
A	I'm your first born
B	I said she obviously can't care that much about me
A	no she doesn't she never talks about you ever she never shows me pictures she never talks about you nothing
B	she goes on and on and on come home and then I finally come home and then she's like I'm I'm going on holiday
A	so I reckon it's all a facade
B	I think it is too
C	I'm not even going to justify anything
B	well you know we're being sarcastic
B	short but sweet
C	we'll be down when we come back
B	that's great really not long enough to argue this time
A	yeah that's a horrible feeling
C	I don't know though I don't think we would now
B	no I hope not
C	I don't think so
A	oh definitely of course come on you got to sometimes it does happen it'll be moments to do with the past that's what it usually is
C	yeah I'm sure there'd be like differences but I don't think it would be as emotional and stressful
B	as it's been
C	as it's been I think the last bout was enough that's it
B	mm
C	it can't we can't do that it's not I don't want
B	no
C	at all I want I want this next year for us to kind of you know spend some nice quality time
A	look at how much you've come through
C	oy oy oy
A	not too hard darling on the fence you can do it harder on that fence
C	can you kick it up the slide? kick it up the slide?
B	or into the bushes?
A	erm
C	he's got too much of a strong kick on him now
B	yeah
A	he is
C	really has
A	yeah kick it that way
A	yeah no that's fine there's only roses there
B	he's going to pop it on the rose bush
C	you've been really good don't spoil it
B	how about into the bush
A	oh that's better because you're
C	not so hard
A	in your
B	how many keepy uppies can you do
E	five
B	go on then can you do six?
E	I tried to do five but I couldn't do it
B	you got to beat your PB
C	he said to me when I put him to bed last night he said tomorrow I've got to go to bed and get up I said yeah but not straight away
B	every day
C	so he says is this what I've got to do? he laid down in bed and then got out of bed
A	did you feel something?
B	yeah I thought I did
C	and I said no not quite you've got to go lay down in bed and go to sleep and
A	so you're driving what?
C	he thought he got to get into bed and then get up again straight away
A	so you're driving so you're leaving about half past nine tonight?
C	yeah to get the ferry for half twelve I thought I felt something then
A	why half past twelve at night?
B	it's a seven hour flight because it was cheap I guess
C	because we just thought it'd be easier to travel through the night with
B	it's definitely raining a little bit
C	yeah
B	there's no clouds though typical English weather isn't it? you look up no cloud and it's raining
C	and then if we can't handle it we'll just park up somewhere and sleep
A	so when you're on the ferry or oh yeah I felt a tiny bit so you're sitting in the car on the ferry?
C	no it's a passenger ferry
B	how long's the ferry?
C	two hours
B	it's not too bad
C	no
A	and then what? and then Spain?
C	and then we drive yeah until we get to where we're staying in
A	have you been out there?
B	yeah
A	you have
B	mum never tell you the story?
C	yeah it's don't darling because the table is rocky can't
A	oh yeah vaguely yeah
B	when I was hitchhiking around Europe
A	yeah do they come to your rescue? or you or you need some help or something?
B	well we'd been robbed we've been mugged numerous times hadn't we?
A	oh the first time
B	five times in the end and eh
B	and I was saying to mum I was very surprised that I actually did go there because at the time
A	you still doing the
B	and I didn't didn't know who his family were or anything
C	that was early days wasn't it?
B	but all I had was this address that he'd sent
C	had you met them even?
B	ah I don't think so I'd never met them and somehow
A	and were they welcoming and everything?
B	yeah really welcoming they were really welcoming
A	that's lovely isn't it?
C	it was almost like that was meant to happen in a way because
A	does it does it still feel like erm home when you come back or not?
B	to England?
A	yeah
B	oh yeah definitely
A	yeah
B	it will always feel like home
A	mm
B	but I
A	yeah I just wondered if it's obviously
C	and
B	yeah
A	no I just wondered if this is this is where you're bred and born so it's always going to be like home isn't it?
C	it's a bit like us
B	it's changing quite a bit though ooh
A	are you alright?
E	yeah
B	knocked off all the petals
C	no prickles
A	oh don't worry about that
B	erm it's changing quite a bit though it's a bit weird because obviously when I come back and I see mum's house and everything yeah I mean that feels familiar but it's not where I grew up
C	mm
B	but where I grew up that area has changed the most like
B	yeah I remember
B	I haven't been back there
C	that's changed
B	no no
C	when you go onto the road
B	no
C	it's just that
B	but I never do go onto the road nobody ever goes up there I just kind of go right next to it and just say
A	so do you go past the it's like we used to go past
C	mm
A	we sort of visualised it as a
C	I bet it would be really small now
A	yeah
C	if we went into it
A	well your house is that you've got is quite a
B	big
A	is it?
B	yeah it's like four bedrooms
C	it's a nice house lovely house
A	four bed what? modern?
C	nah it's old
B	nah it's kind of old it's detached it's stupid because they have a pretty nice house with a pretty nice back garden on a really crappy street in a really crappy location
A	oh
C	is it?
B	so that yeah the whole street is basically terraced and then there's like two detached houses right at the end
C	are they set back aren't they?
B	so that's why they've been they've been broken into and the people next door have been broken into
C	oh you're joking
B	no they've been broke into a couple of times and so are the people next door because they were in this like you know they're not on a road of all detached houses it's just
C	oh no
A	oh god he wants to has he got an alarm on it or something?
B	dad would love to not live there but
A	is that her family home?
C	no
B	no no no they
A	oh they bought it together?
C	yeah
B	it's not cheap I don't know what it is obviously they have a massive mortgage on it again but
A	what? oh I thought they didn't get married?
B	no especially with her being sick I don't think he
C	because she'd think that the family thought that'd be the only reason
B	I don't want yeah them to think that he's you know gold digging so I don't think he wants to marry her for that reason had she not got sick maybe they'd have got married but
A	yeah yeah but its put him off how they might perceive him
B	yeah because their family are quite well off
A	as long as she writes him in the will that's the main thing
B	whether or not she will
A	how is she?
C	I'm sure they will I'm sure she would right?
B	erm I mean she's got her own children to look out for doesn't she so she
A	oh how oh how do you get on with her and and
B	yeah I get on with her she's nice she's a nice lady she's fine erm I wouldn't say we're like close but
A	oh and would she what kids have what kids has she got?
A	oh
B	yeah we knew them when we were younger
C	mm
B	erm
A	so has he been with
C	yeah more or less yeah
B	pretty much yeah pretty much
C	I do yeah
B	that's when I got my tattoo didn't like her don't remember her name she was a bit rough a bit more rough around the edges
B	and
C	she's a lovely lady yeah
B	she's very nice
C	she's quite old fashioned or she was erm but she's yeah I mean she's lovely
A	yeah
C	from what I remember
B	she's she can listen to liberal things it's not that she's you know completely old fashioned she surprised me as I've got to know her more
C	no
C	yeah
B	but at first I found her to be a bit
C	I mean I didn't know her that well do you know what I mean she just came from a
B	yeah
C	just
B	yeah
C	you wouldn't imagine her to go clubbing and stuff like that when she was young
A	oh kind of erm what do you call it? not erm
B	just middle class really yeah
C	or maybe yeah
B	we're all we're all working class aren't we and erm she's middle class
A	mm
B	I wouldn't say she's upper class
C	but then her ex wasn't at all
B	no
C	he was really quite rough and ready
A	so she married beneath her
B	terrible
C	there shouldn't be any of that should there?
A	god
B	out of your caste
C	yeah yeah yeah
A	the royals the top ones the aristocrats then you've got the power of government
B	mm the elite
A	and then you've got the business white collar workers then you've got the workers
C	yeah
A	and then you got the low life
B	the
C	so that's
A	people used to think I was posh
B	people think I am because of the way I talk
A	because one can just deliver a conversation of high quality and and then
B	perhaps
A	yes
A	just at the touch
B	yeah
A	and how do you get on with
B	yeah I
B	not really been around each other's families
C	this is going to be
B	I mean you've never met her have you I don't think?
A	yes once
B	you did meet her?
A	I'm sure I have once
B	she's met
C	she's met
B	I was talking to her the other day she seems to think she's met
A	maybe I haven't met her
B	she seemed to think
C	ah maybe
B	she described
A	maybe I've seen pictures of her and I think I've
C	you think you have
B	yeah
B	yeah literally the first person
A	really?
B	she was in my flat so I've lived with her for ten years
A	and then
C	because they were friends first
B	it was about six months
C	yeah
B	I got with about three or four girls in between that
A	eh?
C	see how I know
C	I meet them at the airport
A	that's it
B	say hello
C	we had an hour conversation
B	I mean it's useful for us we just kind of keep the family separate and it's nice and easy but that's why the whole idea of like having a wedding and getting our families together just sounds ghastly I can't think
A	oh bloody hell we'd be like beaming with pride
B	it's not going to happen
A	oh
B	yeah it's the cost as well
A	oh yeah
B	we're just going to do it as cheap as it comes
C	yeah but you know families will put money into it as well? everyone just wants
B	yeah but I don't want them to
A	at the end of the day
C	yeah you can still have a pub get together couldn't you?
A	at the end of the day you do what you want to do
A	what is it you guys want to do?
A	are you getting married what? for because your
B	for visa purposes really
A	oh right okay
B	so we in our eyes when I proposed to
A	okay
B	because if we're going to the middle east we have to doesn't matter that we've been together for ten years
A	oh I see right yeah
B	I couldn't touch her I couldn't see her I couldn't be in the same room as her
A	yeah
B	couldn't do it
C	does she need to wear?
B	a burka yeah
C	how the heck would she cope with that for a year?
B	well when she's teaching she'll be in an all-girls university and I'll be in an all-boys university
A	she hasn't she's got to wear a thing
B	so in the compound where we live she won't have to wear it at work she won't have to wear it but only when we got out on the street but I mean I'll be wearing a full-on white head to toe thing
C	but does she also have to walk behind you
B	there'll be rules that will apply
C	gosh that is so
B	she can't get a she can't fly out of the country without my permission even though we're married and that kind of stuff it's not an easy place to live
B	but so
A	control
B	after we thought about it like practically
A	why are you going there for for
B	no for work yeah pays well it pays well
A	oh pays well
B	and the jobs are good I can
C	and after paying for
A	what about Dubai? isn't that nice to go to?
B	yes if we can get a job in Dubai or UAE or Bahrain that'll be slightly more liberal
A	yeah yeah
B	and it'll be easier but
A	right so you're doing it and is it safe to go there?
B	you need Middle East experience oh yeah it's fine
C	and is
B	yes absolutely for one yeah I mean we both are kind of excited to live in a place that crazy we like travelling we've been in pretty crazy places so I mean living there for a year I it's a year we know how quickly a year goes
A	yeah it's challenging for you guys isn't it? it's exciting
B	it won't be a problem yeah it won't be a problem
A	what about a send-off before you go bloody out there? you can't
C	god hold on he's only just got back he's not going anywhere
A	no but he's talking about marriage we're talking about the marriage thing and he doesn't want
B	we may not even get married if we if we
A	to go there you have to
B	yeah but if we get a job that's not there we're not explicitly going there I mean if we get a job in Kazakhstan or Iraq or any number of other places that also pay well then erm we don't need to get married then we may never sign the paper
A	mm
B	she might not even change her name
A	so basically oh right that's what I was going to say so basically you're
B	yeah
A	and you see each other as married you just haven't got it down on paper
B	yeah
A	you're not the traditional way
B	no
A	yeah
B	I mean I got her a wooden ring not a not a metal ring
A	yeah when
B	which she loves she really likes it and I kind of said to her you know it's not permanent like a metal ring but whenever it breaks or gets scratched I'll replace it I promised her that I would replace the ring forever
A	yeah
B	and she can have a different ring every time
A	so she's
B	and it's nice as well because she doesn't I told her that she doesn't need to feel like she's got to wear it all the time or anything or worry about it wear it when you want to wear it wear it when you
C	oh I'll bet I bet that meant the world to her
B	yeah she was pretty choked
C	mm
B	I thought she wouldn't be surprised I thought she'd expect it
A	what choked that it was only wooden
B	but erm I mean it was a hundred quid for a ring you know what I mean why am I going to spend thousands of pounds on a ring? it's just ridiculous
C	mm
A	yeah
B	she knows that
C	you're not those type of people
B	she wouldn't want me to
A	no but it's like well it's like
B	mm
A	I
C	that's what's important to them
A	well I couldn't walk around with two grand on my finger
B	no I'm thinking what am I doing keeping this money on my that's not very safe is it? you know? it's ridiculous
A	yeah I'd think what could I do with two grand?
B	yeah well that's exactly it
C	go on a fantastic adventure together
A	I'd be absolutely chilled if it was like anything like five six seven eight hundred I'd be like oh my god I can't wear it out what if you know
B	that's the thing with
A	to me that amount of money and what
B	yeah
B	it's ridiculous
E	hey mummy
B	but it was beautiful and they enjoyed it and people do
A	it's what they wanted
B	personally I'd rather take twenty grand and travel for three years
A	yeah
B	and just have a cheap ass forty pound wedding
C	yeah
A	but then
B	yes so she couldn't
A	so they
B	and they'll remember it forever
E	yeah
A	you're playing oh you're you're Ben 10 aren't you?
A	yeah I thought you were
B	but erm
C	god I better keep an eye on the time a little bit
B	so
C	quarter to five
A	yeah that's wonderful darling
B	I mean if you think when I went to
A	what was what was
B	that was years ago
A	oh yeah
B	but erm I'm just saying about the cost five months in
A	on your travelling
B	there's places definitely
A	yeah
B	there's experiences that we've had definitely
A	and what are they?
B	oh I mean there's so many you need to kind of just be around me and I'll tell you a story at some point but
A	well does anything stick out? that was really remarkable? I know there must be so many
B	ah hiking in the
C	do you still feel the wow factor?
B	I've seen a I've seen a volcano erupting from
B	we've got lost numerous times I've seen some amazing animals seen beautiful snakes very deadly snakes when I've been travelling all sorts of things there's so many so many stories I've got but erm
C	he needs to write a book doesn't he?
B	I can't just say it I
A	oh
B	once we've done Africa I think we'll feel like more content
A	yeah yeah one more
B	you know maybe we'll start thinking about settling down a bit more but erm the main plan now is do the MA do one year in
A	a
B	a delta
A	delta
B	I've already got a CELTA it's an acronym for diploma of English language teaching
A	yeah
B	it's the equivalent of a masters but once I've got that
A	fabulous
B	but saying that we're already thinking that we want to go back to
B	yeah I don't know we've got at least ten years more I think
A	and do you think you'll have children between you both eventually? is it something on your? that you've both talked about
B	we've both said you know part of us that's a massive experience to miss out on
A	can you imagine like Indiana Jones there'd be a it'll be a
A	come on son we're off to Africa again
A	okay dad
B	I don't think there's enough time or money is the problem if I had another ten years another ten years I think I could
C	mm
B	if if
A	yeah
B	that kind of thing which we could do by the time we're forty I think we can have kids at forty
A	where do you see? where do you see yourself? course you can
B	oh no we can't
A	yeah I did at forty
B	and we're like so maybe maybe we'll adopt
B	is what we've discussed if
A	oh you think you might adopt do you
B	if we get to like if we get to like forty and we're comfortable
A	yeah
B	we feel educated enough we've got a good enough job we feel that we can provide for our children comfortably
A	I should think you will be able to
B	then erm maybe at forty we'll start thinking about about having children but it won't be until then
C	come on in
B	like we've really seriously discussed it and I can't see how we could have children until
A	mm
B	yeah
A	come and sit here darling you're happy with your lives the way they are going and you're enjoying more importantly enjoying it enjoying the experiences and the countries
E	I'm hungry
B	it's
A	not really
B	but it's also I look around and just see
A	yeah
B	we'd take a child and
A	I mean the way you talk it sounds absolutely
B	yeah it bothers me as well that I feel like at the age of four you kind of have to give your child up for the state and just kind of like oh yeah school is now
unknown_female	apart from
B	I'd much rather you know we teach the child I mean
A	when she's
B	when
A	yeah and you raise you teach your own child
B	but that's not particularly easily done so
A	you don't know where you're at in ten years do you?
B	we might try and get dual citizenship with another country we've seriously considered you know maybe
A	keep the legacy going
C	mm
B	I haven't got any inheritance coming
A	yeah
B	I'm not
A	yeah
A	well the only inheritance you'll get is a share of mum and eh
B	that's not going to happen though I don't think it's I mean
A	not for a long time
B	ah they've got
B	so I mean he's going to need most of the
C	no
C	fifty
B	I mean let's face it who who
A	I thought that was a bit wrong
B	okay but I mean when I
E	hey
A	young man
B	I'm not actually expecting mum to live to her
B	I mean who in our blood family has lived beyond seventy? Nobody
E	you said one
A	erm
E	you were lying
B	how old was nan when she passed?
A	sixty-nine
B	I mean I'm not wishing away your life or anything
A	darling no no your toys
B	I'm
A	yeah you're you've talked about it yeah
B	no worries so they don't have to worry about that kind of thing
A	no my kids aren't my kids haven't got anything coming their way we got I think we got about well
B	well I I
C	property
B	no so I just you know
A	I think it's up to kids nowadays anyway it's nice to have a windfall it's nice to have something to pass on but nowadays kids go out and make their own way in life don't they?
B	so different in
A	is it?
B	they erm they erm you know pretty much ninety-five percent of the country goes to uni and of that ninety-five percent that goes to uni ninety-five percent have it completely paid for by their parents they live with their parents until they're in their parents no worries erm their parents will leave them everything at the end it's all about family there it's all like
A	yeah yeah
B	I'm not
A	no they
B	but they can't understand to think when I tell them that I lived on my own at the age of seventeen and I started travelling when I was like eighteen nineteen
A	they're like what the hell? you're still a baby
A	yeah
B	can't comprehend it it was really weird when I first went to
A	yeah
B	this is ridiculous they had no idea of really what we were doing or like
A	so they're very very
B	they don't live without their family
A	so they're very protective
B	yeah
A	and they stay in one spot rear the children make sure they've got everything and then leave it all to them and go
B	yeah but they're they really push them it's terrible what they put their children through it's horrible they may have the second best schooling in the world but it's horrible I mean if you take the average high school
A	what do you mean? they don't play?
B	I mean they play at school I guess but
A	it's chores when they come home and
B	it's not chores it's school again I mean
A	oh studies
B	yeah If you take the average high school student they pretty much in a lot of the schools live on site they'll go to school they'll go to school at like seven am they'll finish school at like five or six then they go
A	that's a long day
B	then they go to a private school at like eight and then stay there until midnight
A	what?
B	so they study all day all day they have no life and then they finish school and then they go
A	and this is normal for what?
B	yeah for everyone and then they finish school and they go to university and then they the boys have to do military service for two or three years and then a that comes in the middle of uni and then they come back and they finish uni and then they're getting in to their late twenties and if you're not married with children by the time you're thirty you're weird in
A	so they can't
B	no
A	and
B	I mean they do get drunk it's a country of alcoholics they drink a lot a hell of a lot they can
A	and what do the girls the girls' life is that much the same? study study
B	yeah the same
B	yeah really high really high
A	what? because the kids can't hack it?
B	yeah and it's getting worse because I mean the country's come on so far in fifty years fifty years and it was one of the poorest countries in the world and now it's one of the richest and it's like
A	what?
B	yeah its really really I mean it's not
A	it's one of the richest
B	it's it's in it's the top five in in
A	oh
B	it's a on a on a bunch of grounds on a bunch of things they do a they do things better than we do it's really very modern and very like
A	and do their children when they go go to university go to university over there? or come to other countries for their degrees?
B	if their parents are loaded they'll send them abroad but if most people don't I mean it's a thing although I see the population is the same as England but in England we've got about a hundred and twenty universities in the whole country in Korea they have over three hundred so they've got almost three times the amount of unis that we've got because like ninety-five percent of people go to uni in fact this is they call it school they don't really see it as something different in England we wouldn't we wouldn't say universities as schools it's not school it's almost mandatory
A	yeah it's just like school
B	so they kind of call it school
A	yeah
B	and they don't really understand when I'm like no uni is not school then they're like yeah it is but like
A	yeah
B	I mean the word
A	yeah
B	it's school you know? so on the one hand some of their society
A	it's quite regimented in their studies
B	yeah absolutely
A	very important
B	and it's sad because they're very naïve and very like not they're not wise about the world they don't have much street wisdom or anything
A	but then when they study and they're doing all this
B	some do they're getting better they're definitely travelling more and travelling more is opening up their eyes to ways other people live and what's going on so the society I come back to England and I say oh they've built a new school or something but really England's changing very slowly it's not it's not really changing like
A	wow
B	but they follow the American
A	but you see that would that's sad to me
B	it is sad it's wasted material
A	it's it's sad because there's so much history's is so interesting
B	yeah
A	isn't it?
B	yeah
A	our forbear fathers and you know and it's like
E	is your six pack like that?
B	it is a part huh? my six pack like that? definitely bigger than that I've got like a twelve pack
A	it's it's hard to not it's hard to erm
A	knock down get rid of
B	though part of part of that it has its pros and cons I do love all the architecture but it it keeps us a bit stagnated in England it makes it difficult to change things like policy and like social
unknown_female	so it's just
A	yeah
B	the way people are about things it's very difficult to push things through in government because we have all these rules and regulations on how things must be
A	yeah
B	whereas in countries like
A	yeah
B	you know if something goes wrong I mean did you hear about that ferry sinking?
A	yeah
B	terrible three children died
A	yeah
B	just off the coast terrible planning they'll never admit it really but the whole reason is because they listen to orders from above and the order came out do not move so everyone sat in the ship and it took the ship an hour to sink and for ages they're just sitting on this ship slowly tilts and by the time its tilted and all the rescue crews are there they can't get them out and they stayed in there because they'd been ordered to stay in there it's ridiculous
A	mm
B	so they've now completed changed policy and like really stepped up on their like health and safety on boats and all this kind of stuff but it's it's sad that things that that's part of their
A	I've heard the name but I don't know what it means
B	he was a philosopher
A	yeah
B	in China and they they followed
A	yeah
B	and then there's your place in society and what you must do it's kind of like a caste system affectively but it's like through peers and through youe your people that are above you
A	yeah
B	so they believe that you know if if a teacher tells them stay there well they they honestly believe that because the teacher is in is in superiority
A	yeah
B	whereas in in the west we are very independently minded we'd have never sat there we'd have been like ah hang on a minute
A	yeah
B	I'm on a boat that's going to sink I'm not going to stay inside
A	yeah
B	but
C	whatever happened to those children that were abducted from that school? we heard any more about that?
B	in
C	no not in
B	in England?
A	oh
C	I'm not sure what country it was now
A	erm yeah
B	I don't think I ever heard about that
C	they were just taken from the school weren't they?
A	yes yeah no I know that's about several weeks back now
C	yeah yeah months
B	I never heard it where's your toilet? it's just
A	down around the corner yeah I never know how I don't know
C	huh?
A	you look shattered
C	I am
A	when did you finish work?
C	Friday
A	oh nice
C	yeah sorry
A	and he's got his place down erm
C	yeah hopefully signing the contracts on the twenty-seventh
A	so when you come back will he be in
C	yeah
A	he's going on the twenty-seventh of er August?
C	yeah yeah I've given him
A	yeah
C	erm
A	yeah I've I've completely forgot that
C	yeah you do don't you?
A	yeah
C	yeah he's been really good
A	what was he like when he was
C	he was hyper wasn't he?
B	yeah really hyper mum hyped up slow motion or whatever this is
C	no I'd say it's
B	I'm not sure it lived up to expectations
B	every time play this play that and I was quite jet-lagged
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	you were great with him he was he was just very full on and now he's just kind of relaxed
B	it's chilled out more
C	yeah
B	you off to the toilet
C	don't trip over the toys
A	so now it's just like oh
C	yeah
A	and then
C	yeah he's been out playing with his friends today hasn't he?
A	it's what he's used to isn't it?
B	yeah
A	you appear and then you go
B	is the? is the door stuck?
C	can you open
B	wait one second
C	oh my god
B	so you're down to
A	yeah Saturday
B	how are you with
A	with who?
B	no you all just don't get on
A	oh not with
B	no
A	oh no
B	don't want to talk to her or just
A	I've never met her I've got no interest to meet her
B	no
A	I don't have a relationship with
B	oh not at all so you're not going to see him when you go down
B	oh okay
A	if
B	no no
A	but
B	so where will you stay?
A	oh I've I've hire I hired a cottage apartment thing
B	still in
A	in
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	nice
A	but erm he just I think because of what happened with the the break-up and then me erm
B	oh okay
A	and stuff and erm so did
A	yeah
B	so you don't talk to her either?
A	not very much no I I no she took the same approach
B	why do people take sides on things you know
A	because they are erm
B	shouldn't it be about being?
A	narrow minded? I don't know feel they got to fight the fight with a side with somebody and you know
B	well I mean I doubt they have much contact with
A	I've no idea if he does
B	I doubt
A	anyway so that's how they were so
B	yeah I mean that's fair I understand that
A	you know so I
C	you were sixteen
A	sixteen
B	it's weird
A	you know at that age you're like
B	because from our perspective as the the grandchildren he's the only grandparent anyone has yeah so he's my grandad
A	and he's the only he's your
B	which I find weird because what you're saying like with
A	mm
C	I find it hard with
B	I find the concept a bit strange
A	I'll tell you what you won't do when
B	if
A	if that happens
B	but you won't be acknowledged
A	you will feel you will feel you will feel differently because they are your blood
B	so the the children don't obviously
C	I'm sure I would but no
B	I mean
A	oh yeah I think they do
C	I think I think that that has crept in yeah because they never ask about us or what we're doing or where we've been or did we have a good holiday there's no general conversation at all it's all about them and their lives and and what they're doing erm he's in the bushes I don't think he can get out
B	he's completely disappeared
A	it's hard isn't it though? the split up
B	oh there he is he's hiding in the
A	no he can't get out there at all
C	oh
B	he's hiding
A	that was a good one
C	what's he found?
B	I don't think he's paying any attention to us whatsoever
C	no he's not
A	he's in a he's in a little world on his own
B	erm yeah
A	yeah
C	I think it's more the fact that they resent that
B	mm
A	it was
C	yeah I mean it was bad timing totally
B	I mean to a to a degree that's understandable isn't it? she's probably thinking it's my turn to have children
C	yeah
A	yeah
B	and I want
A	I want my dad to
B	yeah
C	yeah totally and we understood that and we have the conversation of should we get rid of
B	well it's not too late
C	that's a cracker
A	oh god
C	because we know that oh my god this is the worst time ever
A	I love the sense of humour that's funny
A	that's a good one
B	I mean the same for us yeah to a certain degree as you're getting older it would've been nice when I come and visit to like have you your attention you know fully but
C	mm
A	yeah
B	I'm not going to resent it or anything like that it's just how it is
C	I mean I don't know for sure but that's how it seems to be
B	yeah
C	that's what is I feel is probably the the thing
A	they're a funny pair aren't they? they don't pay enough attention to their dad
B	but I mean do you need them?
C	no
A	no but they're
C	yeah course and you know I care for them and
A	but do you need them? perhaps that's what
C	it's not that needing though is it? it's about their family and I guess so yeah
B	obligation
C	it's erm
A	do you need your mum and dad?
B	yeah I do
A	there you go thank god you said that
B	that's why I come home every so often yeah
A	you know you do don't you?
B	I don't as much as other people do but
A	no
B	yeah
B	that's the
C	yeah yeah
B	but need is different to want
A	they're fine
B	okay we better make a move soon
B	we have?
A	because you got to get back?
C	well just got to kind of like sort dinner out and have a shower and chill
B	what's the time?
C	it's ten past four
B	cool
A	so when are you?
B	shall we go outside while he smokes this?
A	when are you going down to

C	yeah
B	when would it be on Friday?
C	but she'll be working on Friday won't she?

C	well she does but I said knowing
E	trick shot trick shot
A	let me get it on the phone
B	no don't worry about it
A	no
B	I can't talk to her at the minute though because of this I'd have to stop this
A	can't you stop it?
C	she's at work anyway
A	yeah I know but just to go hello hears his voice and it'll
C	he'll ring her
C	let them sort it
B	is that alright yeah? I promise I'll ring her and I'll I'll meet up with her at the weekend if she's around if she's not then I'll I'll at another time
C	or evenings
B	yeah or the evening I mean she's only round the corner so
C	she can come round ours
A	she's literally around the corner
B	mm
B	I'll probably see dad either
C	what will you do? will you stop at dad's for a few days or will you get him to drop you back in the morning and?
B	well I'm not going to hang around at dad's if it's just
C	it's not no
B	he'll probably drive me back and then drive me back again
B	yeah
C	just pick you up after work
A	well
B	yeah and that was the plan
A	yeah
B	and again I'm around for a year so dad's not as much you know he's not that bothered so it's true it's fine
C	I'm sure he is
B	well yeah but I mean as long as he sees me a couple of times
C	yeah yeah
B	he's not like
C	yeah
B	I don't need to be there for a long time
C	not like mothers where they have to hang off you
B	and he's going to
A	yes
A	literally drool all over you
B	he's going to come down to
A	want to change your nappy again
C	is that definite?
B	oh yeah he told me he got the van
C	oh fantastic so you're moving on the Wednesday and on the weekend
B	and on the
C	brilliant
B	I don't know if the van's big enough to get everything in it but it's definitely big enough to get the bed and like some stuff so I mean unless it's about yay high I should be able to stack it up
C	yeah I mean if if it's if it's a matter of erm if you can get the big stuff in we can bring the other stuff by car
B	yeah
C	rather than bring it in a van
B	I'll prioritise and see what needs to go in
A	so you've just got what? a little flat?
B	erm yeah it's a one one bedroom large living room large bedroom erm
C	bedroom
A	kitchen bathroom
B	yeah basically
A	seven fifty
B	seven fifty yeah no bills no
A	that's
B	no no no sorry I've got to pay bills on top of that and all that kind of stuff it's all electric
C	what do you get in with that? do you get the council tax as well?
A	oh
B	because we're students we don't pay council tax
C	oh that's something
B	yeah
C	so
B	we have to pay water we have to pay internet we
C	gas and electricity
B	there's no gas it's just electricity
A	so about a grand will be going out won't it? a month
B	I really hope it's not another two fifty on bills I mean
E	trick shot trick shot
C	electric won't be that bad
B	we won't put on any heating we won't erm we won't cook too long we won't erm have baths or anything
C	just limit your washing machine yeah
B	so we're just going to do as little as we can yeah
A	so
B	I'm hoping it's not two fifty I was planning for one hundred one fifty on bills
C	and then you got food on top of that haven't you?
B	yeah I've saved enough money to pay for the rent to pay for my tuition fees and pay for my food and bills
E	trick shot trick shot
A	for a year?
B	for a year and then if I need to do anything I need to work
A	so at the moment you're you're quite loaded right now but in a year's time
B	I'm not I'm not
A	no I meant oh that was a joke you know what I'm saying
B	well I kind of
C	you've allocated it you've got it enough
B	I've already put down six grand on my tuition fees that's gone and I paid that a while ago
A	yeah yeah
B	I've already paid erm
A	what about
B	she's paid yeah she's paid those
A	so you've both done the same
B	I just handed the the agency seven and a half grand over to them so that was my deposit and eight months of rent and I still owe them four months of rent so I've already paid that so at the minute I've got
A	oh that's good so you're paying it out the way done
B	yeah erm my job still owes me two more pay checks so at the minute in my bank I've only got about a grand and a half I don't have very much money at all but they owe me another three grand which I'm going to get erm
C	and then with this job as well that'll bring you
B	and then now I'm earning her so basically anything I earn off this will
C	and then
B	sorry
C	oh god that nearly hit me in the face
B	it's a little blow up ball you'd have been fine
A	it's just kind of like a slight bruise
C	yeah
B	so this will pay for me to visit or to
A	so what do you do? just going round taping people?
B	yeah as long as they're British
C	do you want to get
B	I need you to consign it I need you to sign a consent form in a minute and then I have to go home and analyse it a little bit for what kind of dialectical features that basically they're just seeing what your what your accent is they're not listening to what we're saying they're listening to the words that you use and your accent that's it
C	we're going in a minute darling
B	erm it's going into a corpus so effectively everyone I record is being archived for history so forever if they ever want to look up what did British people sound like in two thousand and fourteen your voices will be on there you'll be recorded
E	then when you get to your hands turn it
A	that's an easy way to make some money
B	it's really easy yeah it's a really good job I was lucky to get it pretty lucky
E	open your fingers
A	and what's
B	it just so happens this is the first as far as I know this is the first time they've ever made a recorded corpus so before they've they've made a written corpus so they did a corpus like ten years ago and that was three hundred million words that they input in the corpus so there's a body of language and this is what British English was ten years ago written and now they want a spoken one so they're paying
A	and what's
B	the same
A	oh she's
B	but we're only contracted under one contract which is a bit of a problem for tax purposes so I have to do my own taxes on this and all that kind of stuff so I have to be self self-employed so I have to at the end and yeah in April I need to file
C	come on go on and put the toys away now because we need to make a move darling
E	okay okay
A	so you've you've earned eighteen quid
B	yeah it's like the perfect job for me and while I'm while I'm studying I don't have to go for a job interview and teaching is quite stressful although I'm only teaching you know fifteen hours a week I have to do another ten fifteen hours of planning
C	you might pick up some proofreading as well
B	yeah I plan on doing some proofreading I'm going to sell all my CDs and all that kind of stuff and just try and make any extra money I can on the side
A	mm
B	so I'm just going to try and get as much as I can while I can really
A	I'm sure you'll pick up
B	yeah I mean there's plenty of language schools around there but I didn't want to be teaching this degree is going to be pretty full on so teaching's stressful let's say I just did ten hours teaching
C	but to sit there and have a conversation with your mates or whatever it's
B	yeah and once I sign the
A	mm
B	it's pretty useful I may be able to get work transcribing it because they're going to have people listening to this phonologists and writing it in a completely different alphabet the one I was talking to you about
A	mm
