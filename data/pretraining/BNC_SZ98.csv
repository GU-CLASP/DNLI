B	fifty?
A	no
A	there's six different packs of different types of custard cream
B	oh good god what do you mean different types of custard creams?
A	they've got chocolate cream orange cream strawberry cream
B	oh my god wow
A	coconut cream digestive cream
B	good god
B	who invented these creams?
B	oh god so how was your weekend in general though? how was it? was it good?
A	yeah
B	was it nice to be home?
B	yep yep hung hung the
B	it's yeah and now it's all soaking wet
A	good
B	yay
B	I know weekends I think go really quickly at the moment
A	this one particularly though I don't know why
B	mm
A	fine
B	yeah
A	he's fine when he's not around her
A	mm
B	god
A	he's like
B	really?
A	mm
B	to be fair I think that's really unfair like a lot of men don't come forward because because of domestic abuse
A	mm
B	because they think it's like unmanly or whatever
A	mm
B	such bollocks
B	that's so sad
B	yeah
A	like is there a refuge for men?
B	there probably is something but
A	yeah
B	it's just not very well documentated
A	it's not
B	domestic
A	it's not it's not physical it's
B	that's sometimes just worse that's not worse like
B	mm
A	and he hasn't got any money and she doesn't give him any money like doesn't share
B	yeah
A	he's got nothing
B	but then again it's like why is he with her? why doesn't he just leave her?
A	well then that's
B	mm god I'd hate to be in a relationship like that obviously er er anybody would hate to be in a relationship like that
A	mm
B	yeah
A	that's not an issue like you wouldn't have ever thought that there was any problem
B	mm
A	he just gets he suffers from really bad anxiety now
B	ah
A	and he's got
B	yeah
A	like he's got
B	oh yeah yeah like through stress like IBS triggered through stress and stuff
B	yeah
B	mm
A	he was like I I don't know what's what's what happened really like my stomach hasn't been playing up at all since I've been here
B	ah
B	ah that's er bless him
A	mm
A	mm
B	apart from just look after him when he comes over and just spend time with him
A	luckily he's been assessed by er mental health
B	oh that's good
B	that's really good
A	housing association and domestic abuse people
B	oh wow brilliant well not brilliant but you know what I mean? like it's good that they're taking steps in that direction
B	it's just
B	like
A	yeah
B	and the amount of things she sees she's just apparently on average it's a woman is either er physically abused or emotionally abused forty-eight times before she calls the police
B	I was just like forty-eight times
A	mm
B	on average that means somebody must've like taken er like a hundred beatings before they called the police
A	mm
B	that's it's just horrendous isn't it?
B	cos you always think oh if I got if my boyfriend or if my husband hit me I'd go straight to the police or I'd leave him but you
B	like as much as I like pretend that I'm like a really strong person and all that kind of stuff if I was in love with somebody and he hit me I'd still be like oh he was having a bad day and it won't happen again
A	yeah
B	cos you just would
A	you would or you'd say oh maybe I pushed him to
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	and and if you probably got into that mindset for a long time you'd just start believing it wouldn't you?
B	yeah er yeah I
B	I as much as I'm ashamed to admit it if my if I was in a relationship and he hit me once I probably would take him
A	I probably would as well
B	I probably would take him back
A	I probably would
B	second time I would be like fuck no
A	yeah
B	the first time er I always I would always try to give someone the benefit of the doubt
B	which I know in that situation you probably shouldn't
A	and then er then you're opening yourself to always letting it happen
B	yeah exactly yeah
A	mm
B	but erm yeah at least your uncle's getting the help he needs
A	hopefully
B	well yeah fingers crossed
B	boring
A	she doesn't want to like help herself and it's really frustrating
B	yeah people who don't wanna help themselves really oh they just aggravate you don't they? cos you know what they have to do and they know what they have to do they just don't fucking bother doing it
A	well it's like she I dunno I tell her all this stuff that she can do but she doesn't do it cos she doesn't feel like she can do it
B	mm
A	like yeah yeah everything that you say to me makes sense and er I understand everything you're saying I really appreciate it and it's like well
B	do it then
A	do you understand or not? if you don't understand then just tell me and I'll try and explain it to you better not that erm obviously my way is the high way but
B	no how old is she?
B	mm
A	it's not
B	mm yeah
B	what? the people you work with or?
A	no this couple
B	oh really?
A	kept bringing it up like over and over again like I'm saying you know you
B	erm were they? hang on you went you took wait a minute you went to
A	that wasn't a day off though I don't think
B	and you've been to the Dominican Republic so where else do they think you?
A	I went to Portugal
B	okay but that was like
A	but that was only
B	that was in July
A	she was like oh well you're lucky you get to go on holiday
B	well I'm sure you went on holiday when you were younger
A	exactly
B	oh
A	they really made me feel really uncomfortable actually I was just
B	ah
B	yeah there's only so many times you can kind of laugh it off and brush it off isn't there?
A	yeah
B	and then you're just like fuck off
A	I really wanted yeah er and I probably can't really say fuck off to them
B	no not if they're an old person no
A	fuck off
B	fuck off you annoying old bitch
B	I think you'd get fired for that
B	yeah
A	oh I'm I'm really sorry don't tell anyone
B	and then you'd be like yeah but she has dementia she doesn't know what she heard
A	no she hasn't got dementia
B	damn it
A	she hasn't
B	oh
A	she's convinced that she has got dementia but she hasn't
B	oh god
A	she's really difficult actually
B	mm
A	tomorrow then I've got I've not got to see her for another four weeks
B	oh that's good then
B	so what's she complaining about? she doesn't normally see you in four weeks anyway
A	I know
B	so
A	I didn't miss any appointments
B	no well
B	oh god I thought you were I thought she was like annoyed because you like missed an appointment or something
B	god okay fair enough what an annoying woman
B	no they should be like wow that's awesome erm like I hope you had a good time
B	no
A	exactly
B	go to someone else someone else can get lumped with her
B	ah
B	really?
B	yeah I'm just trying to help you and if this isn't helping
B	yeah
A	she's not very good at exploring
A	mm
B	mm
B	it's a good
A	well the that's that's
B	oh
A	and it's like
B	stop staring at me
A	staring at me yeah
A	maybe she could read my mind?
B	ah
A	oh dear how was your weekend?
B	er how was my weekend? so oh yeah Friday night dinner was fine like I went with
B	so when you have a conversation with her and you know that if you say anything about anybody she'll twist it and she'll tell someone and it'll just be like
A	yeah so you can't really talk
B	yeah
A	about anyone
B	so you can't really say anything erm but it was fine and then I went to
B	we were just lying in bed chatting and er not me and
A	wow
B	suddenly driven up to
B	and it was just like erm yeah sorry I haven't spoken to you over the last two days I was like
B	it's it's fine you don't have to apologise for it but fine erm
A	why would you why would he speak to you every day anyway?
B	I don't exactly I don't know I just
B	er sorry I haven't spoken to you I really wanted to text you last night because of the rugby I was like okay erm I broke up with
A	oh god
B	fuck and I er was just like okay then
A	well that's good
B	he's like I broke up with her on Wednesday I was like
B	I guess but they live together I told you like a month ago they moved in with each other
A	yeah
B	and like she like put loads of stuff on Facebook like oh we're buying furniture from Ikea together and all this kind of bollocks and like that was in what? August? and like in like
B	when he told me in August he was like oh yeah I told her she was brave and I was like mm I think more stupid but we'll go with brave and he was like oh you're so cynical
A	well he's right back where he started
B	exactly exactly
A	what was the point?
B	so he's back living with his parents she's in the flat alone convinced that they're gonna get back together until he sent her a
A	does she live in Australia?
B	yeah she's
A	oh my god she needs to go back to Australia and never look back
B	exactly like I told him when she moved over I was like why are you inviting her over? you obviously don't like her that much he's like yes I do
A	don't you dare meet up with him
B	no no no I'm not but like I'm like do I actually? did you even ask me if I wanted to meet up with you? no you didn't
A	just such a chauvinist
B	yeah and I was just like
A	ah
B	and he's just like and then suddenly a week later he comes back to England and he was like oh yeah I'm never gonna talk to you again because my girlfriend's coming over
B	I'm just like what the one you called an obligation in an email to me? that's that's great
B	he gives me like a running commentary of his life
B	yeah
A	I don't really understand
B	but he's literally just gone round in a massive circle
A	yeah
B	like he's come back from Australia cos he hates Australia brought a girl who he should never have brought back with him she came over got a job er you know tried to make a life and everything and he's literally just sent her back home
A	poor girl
B	yeah I feel a bit bad for her but then I also think she's stupid
A	she's well love is blind isn't it?
B	true
B	true but I'm just like
A	that's him though that's not her
B	no no that's not her at all
B	yeah yeah of course yeah
B	no I completely agree like I said to
B	and he in er one of his messages he actually wrote you'll
A	yeah I know you said that
B	and I was just like
A	that's utter bollocks as well
B	I was like no I won't what is wrong with you? and then in the end er he just and he was like yeah we broke up I was like and apparently she thought like one after he sent her that text message being like we're over like you we're not getting back together you like find a way home she like threw all his stuff out onto the street
B	and I was like yeah fair enough I was like erm
A	go girl
B	yeah erm bit dramatic don't get me wrong but
A	you go girl
B	I was still yeah I think you she's trying to make a point that you've been a twat
A	yeah I think that's
B	like you knew a month ago before you moved in with her that you didn't wanna move in with her
A	yeah
B	I told you that
A	where were they living
B	she was working in
A	mm
B	and he was working he was in
A	where was she living?
B	she was living in
A	oh right what?
B	yeah I think well he said she was working in
B	so in like
B	and I was like
B	why did you do it?
B	it's like he did it because I actually don't know why he did it
B	no
B	no I agree I don't actually know what he even wants what he want even wants out of life
A	he probably thinks that he can
B	well he can think again can't he?
A	yes he can
B	like er I saw
A	he's a
B	yeah
A	he's not a very nice person I don't think
B	like
A	he's only looking now to you because er
B	he does it I've I've told him yeah like well I've already told him I was like
B	yeah it's like if I was naïve I'd be like oh wow he cares so much but he just doesn't
A	no he's
B	he's just doing it because he doesn't know what else to do
A	and he knows that you're there I suppose
B	yeah like I don't
A	yeah
B	but it's still kind of like obviously a part of me still just like I want to help him and then a part of me is like it's not my responsibility to help him anymore he's not my boyfriend
B	yeah oh no cos you know he wouldn't give a shit
A	oh yeah how was
B	she was er she was okay
B	she did waffle on about money a lot
B	she was like well
B	and she was like yeah but I er you know like I'm gonna er be earning like forty-five
B	and she was like yeah if I get this job in
A	nothing to show for it really
B	yeah I was like
A	well things but not
B	yeah I was like you don't like you and
A	oh god no but at least you know
B	but
A	if you live together as well that's a little bit bad
B	you'd yeah but like having your work life take over your normal life so much that you're you're working more than you're living
B	yeah
A	money's not that important
B	no I'd rather earn forty grand and have a life than sixty-seventy grand and have no life let's say that and she was like yeah I I wouldn't I was like well that's fine
B	I was like I was like well we're just different people like she was like yeah I'm also I'm not one of these people who go travelling I'd rather just go on holiday for two weeks come back and then earn some more money and I was like
A	that's fine
B	yeah that's fine just accept that other people in the world want to go travelling and you know
A	yeah
B	see the world and she was like I could never stay in a youth hostel it's like oh good god like you're twenty-four twenty-five years old twenty-four years old chill the fuck out love like
B	yeah
A	they're not that bad and who gives a shit at the end of the day?
B	yeah
A	you're not gonna live there
B	exactly
A	you can have your Le Creuset pots when you get back
B	yeah she was like she was very much like trying to flash the cash yesterday cos she got a pay rise I think she's like in like thirty odd thousand pounds now thirty-five maybe so she was like trying to flash the cash she was like yeah well I got my next pay rise I wanna spend it and she was genuinely trying to spend money but there wasn't really much to buy but she was like
B	I know and she was like well I wanted to go into Russell and Bromley and like do something I'd regret and you know like Russell and Bromley shoes are like two hundred and fifty pounds per pair of shoes
A	yeah
B	I was like mm good for you then
B	I was like I'm not going in there I can't afford a two hundred and fifty pound
A	yeah
B	like I
B	no
A	no
B	like I have two hundred pounds to
A	mm
B	yeah and petrol and shit so yeah but she's she was okay in some ways and then in other ways she was
B	yeah exactly still money orientated and apparently
B	yeah I was I was like apparently he's fine about it though and apparently no one likes
A	I quite like
B	she grew on me and then she annoyed me and then she grew on me again then she annoyed me er I'm in a love hate relationship with her
A	mm
B	erm apparently
B	yeah apparently yeah his parents really don't like her
A	oh god that's really not very good
B	erm
A	gotta have got you've gotta have the mum on side
B	exactly
B	even if you don't have the dad you've gotta have the mum

A	yeah
B	it was only something like twenty pounds like it wasn't a very expensive tab but I just like I was like shit
B	no normally they take your card
B	but at this pub they didn't take my card so normally you have to go back and get it that's why you have to pay
A	yeah
B	but no here they just they didn't take anything so I was like damn it

A	but I'm gonna ring erm stupid woman what's her name?
B	mm
A	to tell her about the various things that need to be done and also to tell her about the lease
B	mm
A	I might actually spin it so that she thinks it's her fault
A	because you're shit and
B	mm
A	cos it's gonna make people not wanna live here
B	yeah
A	cos what's the point in having them there if they don't do anything? it's so annoying
B	she's just poor she's really poor
A	but then surely they must all be shit? because surely somebody must say
B	yeah
B	mm
B	yeah they're grim
A	and also I've got those ones as well but these are also not very nice
B	I know the ones that aren't

B	Nescafé Latte is the only thing that actually tastes nice
B	the other ones are shit they're really horrible
A	yeah
B	erm

B	but yeah no if you ring up and end the lease and then
A	yeah
B	I will find somewhere else
A	well I guess at least you've got time now
B	yeah yeah I'll probably just rent a room or something
A	why don't you go and live with that that man again?
B	oh yeah the one who hit on me inappropriately
A	demanded his stupid Tupperware back
B	freak
A	he was a freak
B	I dunno why I
A	well let's try and er
B	it's fine don't worry
B	I might try and find like an annex or a studio or something but they'll be so expensive
A	what do you mean? er what the annex will be expensive?
B	yeah
A	well I why don't you look at like
B	yeah
B	yeah
B	but with you it's easy
A	try hard
A	like
B	yeah I have to pretend like to like not be like inappropriate
A	or you can't be grumpy one day
B	exactly
B	I can't just be like piss off I
A	you can't do that
B	exactly
A	what would our deposit be back that we would get? what did we put down?
B	eight hundred no seven twenty-seven seven five wasn't it? it was a month's rent
A	was it?
B	it was a month's rent
A	yeah
B	so we get
A	no it was a month's rent plus something else I'm sure it was plus something else
B	no it was a month's rent plus the month's
A	a month's rent and a month's rent?
B	yeah
A	so like four hundred quid we'll get back then?
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	I think I actually owe that to my dad anyway so
A	daddy
B	that's the thing sometimes like I wish my parents lived closer so I could live at home like it's too far to commute every day
A	mm
B	yeah
A	traffic for me is just there's no traffic so it's fine
B	yeah exactly I've got traffic here and also like I have friends here and I have like a bit of a life here
A	mm
B	and I've got the running club and the netball club and the yoga class although that finishes in December
A	mm
B	I would like to yeah
A	that'd be cool
B	I think so
A	oh that's not gonna fit in there is it?
B	er in the cupboard that smells like death?
A	does it still smell like death?
B	I still think it smells like death I'm not entirely sure what happened in there but it smells a bit like death
A	yep it does
B	and it's still raining and my clothes are still outside
B	no
A	no
A	er it's not gonna rain tomorrow
B	we had a meeting today cos erm we whenever we publish books we publish them for CIE
A	mm
B	and like erm CIE we have to put in a bidding sometimes for books
A	mm
B	er so we bid for like to publish fourteen books last year for them
A	mm
B	and we won them all so we published fourteen books however apparently we're the worst performing publisher in getting the books out
A	oh no
B	so there's us OUP Hodder and Collins and we all bid for products and then like er what are they called? what's it called? when erm begins with B does it?
A	okay
B	so you you go in for er you go in for the tender and then you win the tender and apparently of our fourteen titles and compared to everybody else's we're the worst performing
A	oh my god
B	but it's only like I think because we've got like some really difficult titles
A	okay
B	and then I realised that we
A	oh
B	and er that means I'm literally
B	I'm nearly like er fifty percent of the failure is really my fault
A	yeah
B	the candidate numbers in the whole country are like two hundred people the products are gonna cost us like forty grand to make despite the fact that the candidacy is only for like two hundred people
A	god that sucks
B	like yeah it's er
A	why have you got them?
B	I don't know they're non viable we should never have done them they're costing too much they're taking too long and the author's just no
B	and I and and they were just like and
A	that's good though
B	yeah yeah it was just it was just when she said that I was like oh crap I'm the project coordinator for like four out of the ten
B	so
A	it's fine
B	yeah
A	mm
B	what are we gonna do about the sofa?
A	it's fine I'll take it I'll pay you fifty pound and take it
B	oh okay well or twenty-five it was only like a
A	it was a hundred I think
B	oh was it?
A	mm
B	oh okay
A	so there's fifty for my bed as well
B	oh fair enough
A	sure it was wasn't it? yeah
B	yeah I thought yeah
A	mm okay yeah that's fine
B	oh yeah it was yeah
A	mm my mum was like it's a really good sofa so if you don't want it I'll have it I was like okay fine
B	yeah yeah
B	so that's fine with me
A	yeah
B	I guess you can take the bed apart can't you?
A	yeah could probably have that at home anyway cos it's quite a nice bed
B	would you
A	only on the
B	oh okay
A	which is fine cos he's never really home anyway
B	yeah
A	cos I have I've actually
B	yeah
A	it was actually just going back into my own room
B	exactly
B	mm
B	it'll only be for like a year like?
A	not even hopefully not even two years
B	yeah
A	it'll
B	mm
A	cos it was two years from now about eighteen months hopefully
B	how much are you planning on saving?
A	if I can save five hundred pounds a month then I'll have six thousand off by the end of the year and then see what we
B	yeah and also the government have a Help to Buy scheme
A	yeah
B	and
A	he's got a lot saved up so
B	yeah
A	and maybe I can bring something else to the table like the sofa
B	and cooking
A	yeah
B	but also even if like the initial deposit deposit is slightly more him
A	you'd still pay the same
B	you'd still pay the same mortgage
A	yeah
B	and you could just contribute like an extra hundred quid towards the mortgage each month or something like that
A	yeah
B	like you could always work it out that way
A	yeah
B	like in the grand scheme of things if he put in what? like fifteen grand and you put in seven grand or something in the grand scheme of
A	no
B	against like a hundred and fifty thousand pound house
A	no
B	so if you did break up it wouldn't be like well I have seven thousand pounds more invested in this house it's like so?
A	I'd probably just walk away
B	yeah I'd be like it's seven grand
A	it's fine
B	you can have it
A	just take it
B	yeah
A	well you never know we might do
A	I hope not if we were buying a house together I really hope not but you know
