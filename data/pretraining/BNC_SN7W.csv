A	that was the fifties?
B	along the track
A	gosh
B	in
B	he'd always said you know oh he he's he liked the Turkish Cypriots too

A	oh were? oh right?
B	second
A	oh okay
B	erm but they were always
A	mm
B	and and jolly and
A	mm
B	he liked them very much
A	mm
B	and he'd always said
B	but of course it wasn't that easy then
A	oh I see
B	to get flights
A	to get here? yeah
B	back
A	yeah
B	unless you'd always come and you knew the routine
A	right

A	mm
B	erm
A	mm?
B	erm erm a holiday company was offering erm
A	oh right okay
B	erm Green Island Holidays
A	how lovely
B	the first time we came we stayed at the
A	okay
B	erm
A	right
B	what it is now it was a
A	right
B	delightful place
A	right
B	er and none of the houses round there were built it
A	right
B	was
A	oh
B	and you could wander down erm across the road
A	gosh how lovely
B	and onto the sea there was nothing there
A	gosh
B	you know it was wild
A	wow
B	erm
A	sounds divine
B	yeah well it
A	mm
B	I mean
A	true
B	erm but it isn't the same as it was
A	mm
B	and that's what the islanders resent
A	I see
B	erm but it was beautiful I mean it was it was just lovely and we loved it and we did what erm
A	mm
B	and we were coming up to retirement
A	mm
B	and we were thinking wouldn't it be nice to
A	mm
B	have a house in the sun
B	and we immediately bought a bungalow
A	right okay
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	fantastic
B	erm
A	gosh
B	put down the deposit and left
A	that must've been very exciting
B	it was very
A	mm
A	right
B	yeah
A	yeah yeah
B	so this place was then to
A	mm
B	the
A	the cold
B	winter months and

B	and
B	where you where you can er see yeah
A	yeah
B	we got erm
B	huge sea lake we were on before
A	wow
B	erm and he would've been quite happy
A	a bit more than that? yeah
B	a a little bit of culture
A	right
B	so we decided if we were going to do that
A	mm
B	which we
A	had you? gosh

A	right okay
B	sold that
A	mm

B	but erm

A	oh I see
B	so that's er
A	mm
B	to go by taxi

B	because erm
A	right
B	they go that way along the the Sea of Marmara and
A	right

A	and what's the altitude like of the mountains there?
B	it's six thousand feet
A	okay
B	so it's
A	yeah
A	oh right
B	the biggest problem is because it's not that high

A	so it's a new
B	and they've just
A	have they?
B	they started with the erm

B	where they er?
A	a primary school or was it more like a erm?

A	right was a school? yeah
B	er it sort of grew from kindergarten
A	mm
B	to primary
A	mm
B	er and they were housed in that rather nice stone building that is now
A	oh right okay
B	cos it's the same family
A	oh is it?
B	mm
A	oh
B	and er and they were housed there while they were building
A	mm
B	on family land
A	mm mm
B	erm
B	that building
A	to capacity
B	ready to extend
A	yeah
B	and and they erm and they built a whole new section for the erm the primary section again
A	so who
B	it is an international school
B	er and in all
A	okay
B	so
A	mm
B	erm
A	mm
B	they've now got erm
A	okay
B	and the head
A	wow
B	all the children have to speak English and Turkish
A	very good
B	it's excellent
A	yeah
B	classrooms
A	mm
B	erm but they all have teaching assistants that are Turkish speaking
A	mm
B	so they the the the kids are used to speaking
A	yeah
B	and
A	right
B	but his father's Turkish Cypriot but
A	yeah
B	you know?
A	how wonderful
B	mm
A	gosh that's very good
B	it is
A	yeah
B	mm
A	not been much need for it but
B	no
A	in terms of
B	I can't think of any
A	that
B	not that there were none in our area there were no schools in our area that weren't
A	yeah
B	English schools teaching English
A	no I can't
B	I mean
A	no
B	French first
A	really?
B	we did teach Russian
A	I see
B	it was very much like that
A	that's how
B	and we did happen to have
A	right
B	and
A	so they would take an exam in Russian then or would it just be a?
B	oh yeah so take
A	yeah
B	erm they learn Russian in school and they take GCSE Russian you know?
A	okay
B	as another
A	and was that an elective then for some for some of these
B	no
A	and
B	it was quite elitist
A	mm
B	they only the best
A	done Russian
B	you know?
A	yeah
B	but we use to take the children to Russia
A	oh right well of course yeah I mean actually Russia is
B	well absolutely we we
A	yeah
B	we had our exchange schools
A	mm
B	in Russia we used to fly to erm
A	mm mm yeah
B	Saint Petersburg
B	and erm
A	yeah
B	Peter the great and
A	wonderful
B	the the ballet and the circus and the things you do in
A	yeah
B	but we but then after glasnost we were actually the first state comprehensive school that did a Russian exchange an actual exchange
B	family exchange
A	that's very interesting
B	mm
A	and so the kids obviously
B	yes they found it very different
A	yeah
A	mm mm
B	erm but erm
A	mm
B	whereas in cos Germany and France they were similar to
A	to yeah really yeah
B	and I mean
A	right okay
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	whereas that was not the case necessarily in Russia
A	no
B	erm and I always one amusing time
A	oh right okay
B	erm er but we always visited the erm English speaking school
A	right
B	in er Moscow
A	mm
B	all very organised
A	yeah
B	er and being pastoral deputy and very conscious of discipline
B	looked me as closely as she could in the eye and said
B	so I thought yeah you're probably like the schools in England that say they don't have a drugs problem you know?
A	yes yeah that's it
B	erm dream on
A	yeah
B	so I said
B	you must have children that occasionally you know
A	of course yeah
B	step out of line and
A	yeah
B	test the system
A	the parents' party card
B	which meant of course
A	gosh
B	father would lose his job if he hadn't got a party card so my goodness me no child stepped out of line
A	no way oh my gosh to be responsible for your dad
B	yeah
A	what a interesting set-up
B	mm
A	yeah
B	I I took
A	mm mm
B	erm the children that went to the English school in Moscow
A	mm
B	were
A	right okay yeah
B	you know? and princesses
A	goodness me
B	I I took the party
A	mm
B	they went home laden with
B	and it was a case that
A	yes right yeah
B	and erm
A	really?
B	and at the time
A	my gosh
B	mm
A	yeah
B	no idea
A	yeah
B	yes
A	but not these cos yeah
B	in the Communist system there was very much an elite
A	yeah
B	mm
A	and how did they behave I mean did they? behave as kids would?
B	the Russians actually behaved quite well
A	right
B	with the behaviour of the Russians I have to say
A	mm not to step out line yeah
B	not to step out of line
A	yeah
B	but but they didn't step out of line
A	mm
B	and
A	mm
B	and they were all working hard for Abitur and they
A	mm
B	it was very important to them and
B	they took everything very seriously the Germans
B	but the French were
B	on more than one occasion we had the police round
B	they'd been
A	oh no
B	honestly it was and their backs were full of
A	d'you remember when Woolworths had the pick n' mix?
B	yes
A	and many people would be shoplifting on their front you know?
A	oh
B	French
A	oh dear
B	so we
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	was on a ski trip
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	and
A	oh yeah
B	and
A	take his life into his own hands
B	by the time we went by coach
A	oh okay
B	so they took him to the airport put him on the first flight
A	did they?
B	bearing mind that we're in
A	oh no
B	so I I got a phone call
A	he's a bad lad he's gonna have to go to Birmingham
B	I know
A	oh gosh
B	child from the airport
A	oh no
B	well I mean
A	awful
B	I my ears are still ringing from the abuse that I had
A	oh no
A	oh but it was quite a nifty move to send him back though on a first plane I mean
B	yeah
A	right
B	off he went and I think he
A	mm what had happened yeah
B	that he'd pushed
A	yeah
B	you know? erm that he was
B	yeah exactly
A	yeah
B	yeah it's interesting well I mean the
A	yes yeah
B	there's so many
A	yeah
B	so many tales to tell really
A	so have any of the kids who came through your school
B	well er not no only one or two I mean one or two did
A	mm
B	we had erm
A	really?
B	he was the er
B	which was quite yeah quite a feather in our cap you know?
A	yeah I'd say
B	because it was
A	mm
B	comprehensive school
A	I see
B	so we had
A	oh okay
B	erm
A	mm
B	that
A	yeah sure
B	and the quality of teaching that those kids had
A	yeah
B	so that
A	yeah
B	I had one lad erm
A	mm mm
B	and his father was an organ builder
A	oh right
B	and he produced a computer program
A	wow what a great idea
B	that his father actually used
A	yeah
B	which is quite novel and unique at the time
A	isn't it? yeah lovely idea
B	erm and he went on ultimately
A	mm
B	and all over I mean he did really really well I
A	mm
B	I loved to hear
A	yeah how well
B	you know that they'd done so
A	yeah
B	we had one
A	right
B	used to entertain the family with her acts

A	okay
A	yes I'm not surprised yeah you don't wanna really see that at home
B	but
A	you deal with it every day at work
B	but
A	right
B	and she did get to a point where she was acting out a bit in school so
B	I was for ever being accosted in the staffroom on the odd occasions I left my office and popped into the staffroom
B	very difficult you know and they know you're
A	yes

B	even when it isn't my fault
A	I know that's the thing isn't it?
B	you know?
A	yeah it's just been drummed into you
B	I would've found that really difficult
A	yeah
B	very difficult
A	I think also
B	yeah
A	so if a lecturer doesn't give an amazing Powerpoint presentation
B	yes
A	or have Youtube videos coming out of his ears or something that's
B	mm
A	meant to be a bit of a jazzy up kind of lecture
B	sure
A	they erm
B	mm
A	different lecturers
B	yes
A	on nearly every single bit of their
B	yes
A	in terms of teaching power
B	mm mm?
A	we always find out who the best lectures are I mean it's like you know I mean
B	oh of course
A	but they're able to within the start of semester the first week they're able to tell students don't bother going to that lecturer because A such and such and such
B	mm
A	erm
A	and then like the poor lecturers or er course convenors are getting
B	yes
A	you know it's it's overwhelming and I
B	oh yes
A	can't see how you're meant to be productive
B	yeah I mean I I can't
A	even as a researcher
B	no
A	I don't know how you're meant to do both
B	no
A	you know?
B	I can't even
A	no
B	because
A	but but people want to work in universities they wanna be on it
A	yeah
B	I mean
A	mm
A	mm
B	and we had
A	mm mm
B	and we had a two stream entry school
A	mm
B	to say come on you can do it
A	mm
B	never mind about those that have gone on to
A	yeah
B	grammar school
A	yeah
B	you know? it doesn't matter
A	yeah
B	erm
A	mm
B	probably had a bad day on scholarship day you know?
A	mm uhu
B	and erm
A	mm mm
B	before GCSE
A	CSE I I remember now yeah
B	CSE
A	CSE yeah
B	erm and
A	wow
B	to school
A	yeah
A	right
B	and I with these five kids
A	oh god
B	and there was a common paper
A	yeah
B	so I did
A	yeah of course
B	with the others working at the back on
A	yeah
A	right
B	in the lunchtime and the single lesson
A	oh
B	was the common core paper
A	right
B	for everybody
A	yeah
B	erm we had one year to do it
A	wow
B	all the boys went on to do erm
A	mm
A	wonderful
B	no
A	yeah
B	they were the
A	yeah
B	really well but
A	mm
B	I
A	mm
B	loved it
A	mm
B	I
A	yeah
B	for me was more important than what I actually taught them
A	yes
B	and and I was happy even when we went comprehensive
A	mm
B	but I always
A	right yeah yeah
B	erm and did all sorts with them and loved it you know?
A	yeah
B	I think so
A	yes
B	I think that's management I think
A	mm
B	that's that's
A	mm mm
B	you know?
A	yeah
B	gave the people the the subjects that they were best at
A	yeah
B	and felt they weren't doing as good a job as they could
A	yeah
B	and this is why
A	mm
B	I mean in my university days
A	yes
A	I wouldn't even know how to talk to them
A	I wouldn't even know how to talk to them I wouldn't know what to say
B	no
A	you know?
B	and that
A	but but these lot you know they are awful I mean
B	mm
A	the academics
B	mm
A	this wasn't part of my job remit but they didn't have scheduled observations
B	mm
A	they felt they weren't actually making any
B	mm
A	have any direct observation so
A	I said sure I'll do that
B	mm
A	they're not there to learn
B	no
A	they they really believe that that sitting there and and look at Facebook and be on a forum and do this and do that and somehow what the lecturers say is gonna get in
A	and that they're going to know when to ask a question
B	yeah
A	I didn't see any questions asked at all
A	and I know that lectures are some some lecturers do ask people to ask questions some don't I always encourage it
B	mm mm mm
A	erm
B	no
A	they didn't know what to ask
B	no
B	and they were they were
A	you know?
A	no
B	they're not
A	spoon fed
B	oh
A	oh my gosh
B	thick
A	I worked as a learning advisor
B	mm
A	who probably shouldn't be at university but we're letting them in anyway
B	sure
A	I said okay
B	mm
A	but anyway erm
B	mm
A	and we'll see if we can come up with a programme that develops people's academic skills
B	mm
A	really quickly
B	yes
A	so they don't lose too much of their learning or the content
B	sure
A	or the time I should say
B	mm
A	and so we worked together like in that way and er we started this idea of embedding academic literacy into the course
B	mm
A	but that's when I realised that though the teachers wanted an
B	yeah
A	like writing
B	yes
A	they didn't want to convey it
B	no
A	you know even the content
B	yeah
A	I wouldn't know how this discourse was put together or
B	mm
A	I wouldn't have a clue
B	no
A	actual lecturer
B	no
A	and
B	sure
A	that's another thing that they over-survey these students nowadays but
A	so if you were getting sort of one point two two point five whatever your erm you know the head of department would want to know why
B	yeah
A	teaching
B	mm
A	who were engaging
B	engaging the yes
A	themself
B	yes
A	and I said even if you're the learner with
B	yes
A	me
B	yes
A	we'll work out some way to actually do it quickly in the lecture or
B	sure
A	you know? and then
B	mm
A	why is it that it's not the same
B	mm
A	nowadays?
B	sure
A	why did these
B	mm
A	kids come to university if they're not academically prepared or academically minded?
B	mm
A	you know?
B	and
A	mm
B	universities in my day were for highly motivated academic people
A	mm
B	that had shown they had a a lust for learning
A	yes
B	and a lust for knowledge
A	a lust
B	isn't it?
A	yeah it is yeah
B	and and they they it's a means to an end now
A	mm
B	er that and I think that's
A	mm
B	a lot of people going into higher education now
A	yes
B	and people that went into higher education were not necessarily motivated by the job at the end of the line
A	yes
B	they were motivated only by the learning
A	yes
B	scholarly learning
A	yeah
B	that was enough
A	mm
B	it but
A	yeah
B	er you know?
A	yeah
B	erm
A	mm mm
A	mm
B	but they they we are not all you know? capable of the same
A	they're true words true words
B	or even suggesting
A	yeah
B	that they have the right
A	the right yes
B	automatically
A	that's the problem
B	to take an education that they are intellectually
A	it's about rights these days
B	not either capable of or suited for
A	yeah
B	and that's the problem
A	no
B	and that's the same intellectually as well
A	that's true as well
B	you know and I think that's the pity
A	yeah
B	everybody now is fed with the idea they have the right
A	mm
B	but they don't have the right
A	mm
B	they should be quite happy and satisfied
A	yeah
B	provide those other options
A	yeah
B	which are viable options
A	yeah
B	it should not
A	no
B	and that's where
A	mm
B	that one was better
A	mm
B	than the other
A	mm
B	and therefore more desirable than the other
A	mm
B	erm
A	exactly
B	you know?
A	far more suitable yeah
B	and this is why
A	yeah
B	this is why it is not that easy in comprehensive schools
B	and we all have to face the fact
A	yeah
B	we could be teaching kids with IQs much higher than our own
A	yeah yes yes that's true that's a scary prospect yes
B	and at the same time
A	yeah
B	children who maybe have English as a second language
A	that's right
B	and are dyslexic er have all sorts of learning problems
A	all sorts of learning difficulties yeah mm
B	and have no parental background
A	mm
B	support
A	mm
A	yeah?
B	your grammar school teachers
A	mm
B	your secondary modern school teachers
B	were stressed because they had to go back to their textbooks
A	mm
B	but
A	mm
B	they coped with the discipline
A	mm
B	a lot better
A	oh I bet the classroom management yeah
B	because
A	mm mm
B	but they had survived on enthusiasm and charisma
A	mm
B	and passion for their subject and the kids
A	yes yes absolutely
B	whereas
A	yeah
B	the grammar school teacher
A	yeah
B	whereas
B	or English
B	you know?
A	yeah
B	but doesn't it give you difference?
A	yeah
B	the different attitude
A	it does
B	and what an and really I think
A	mm
B	of the problems
A	mm
B	today that we're facing in education
A	true
B	and it's tragic
A	mm
B	said it's so demanding I mean she's got a good
A	mm mm
B	from Essex with Anthony King so
A	mm
B	it's not a second rate
A	no no it's a good university degree
B	yeah and a good degree
A	yeah
B	and still says
A	mm
B	and she said and it's fabulous mum I
A	mm
B	now
A	it's lovely
B	if
A	yeah eight year-olds what a lovely age to
B	can give her that sort of feedback
A	yes yeah
B	what is happening? where you know?
A	I know the disconnect between that yeah yeah yes and then you get get them later down the track and they're you know emailing
B	the disconnect
A	yeah
B	any questions? he could've been there now
B	there were
A	yeah
B	there were sixty kids there
A	yeah
unknown_female	woo
A	mm
B	they'd done all sort of tides and water cycle and
A	wonderful
B	and they were
A	mm
B	absolutely amazing
A	mm
B	they had listened
A	wonderful
B	they'd taken it on board enthusiastically
A	mm
B	and and
A	yeah
B	that's
A	yeah lose it
B	and the best they can do is operate an Ipad or an Xbox and and complain about their tutors
A	yes
B	it's tragic
A	I agree but they also the system shouldn't be allowing that I don't know whoever said
B	it's wrong
A	but it is actually a part of the fabric now of university life
B	yeah
A	because it really isn't just one it's not one institution or you know a pocket
B	mm
B	I just find that unbelievable
A	they think it's something to do with customer satisfaction I think the the senior management
B	it's such a commercialised
A	it's the commercialised
B	the commercialising
A	yeah
B	which I of course I've always disapproved of
A	mm
B	you know?
A	and at the top now these universities they always used to be accountants but they're now all marketeers
B	yeah absolutely
A	and they're social media marketeers at that
B	absolutely
A	so they're all
B	you see
A	mm mm
B	to be self-supporting to a certain extent that
A	yeah
B	the the grants and everything are not what they were and and to provide a good education for the kids
A	yeah
B	er you know? erm and I always applauded Warwick for that I was very impressed with Warwick University for that
A	mm
B	really?
A	yeah
B	and
A	yeah
B	they have
A	mm
B	had a great system there I thought
A	mm
B	I was very impressed
A	mm mm
B	erm
A	that's right
B	mm
A	their own institution a lot of them have strived very hard to work for this particular university
B	mm
A	believing that it academically
B	mm
A	you know and then the teaching is wonderful
B	yes
A	people's expectations
B	I know
A	are very often erm misled I suppose
B	yes
A	you know? er particularly the international students
B	yes
A	they have lots of pictures of people like from Vietnam and Africa and various other
B	yeah
A	and then they say oh yes we'll have people small people a small
B	yes
A	help you with certain things
B	yes
A	never do
B	but it's not there
B	the support's not there
A	no no
B	and this is the
A	mm
B	and and they want the international students cos that's where the money is
A	yeah
B	you you see
A	yeah
B	but they are not prepared to spend
A	no
B	on giving kids the support they need
A	yes
B	and that will pull down the standards
A	yeah
A	mm
B	it's not worth the paper it's written on
A	mm mm mm
B	and people will be like that about it
A	mm
B	they they you know?
A	well this is why they want some success stories both from the academics and from the graduates because
B	yeah
A	then that's the reputation game that they can play very successfully
B	yeah
A	because they can say we have graduates who
B	yeah
A	erm they had a statistic that would
B	yeah
A	be blazingly you know put up on the
B	ah yes
A	have a receiving
B	yeah
A	which is pretty good for Australia so
B	oh yes
A	so erm
B	yes
A	you know not necessarily you want to sit in front of a camera
B	no
A	and talk about how great you are I mean some do
B	no
A	but some don't I mean
B	no
A	but they also don't want their face
B	no
A	and it's it's quite interesting because
B	yeah
A	but have some sort of charisma
B	mm
A	have some sort of appeal
B	yeah
A	not necessarily sex appeal I don't think we'd go very far
B	no no no but but but it's part of it
A	but there's something about it and they're putting them up on the front web page
B	yes
A	and they're saying look everyone
B	yes
A	this is what you could have access to if you were to come here
B	I know
A	you know?
B	is wrong
A	mm
B	er and it's a
A	mm
B	I mean we
A	yeah
B	in in a er a lesser to a lesser degree
A	right
B	erm and
A	mm
B	and there were two deputies going because the head
A	yeah
B	so the second deputy went for the headship and got it
A	right
B	so that was his deputy's job and mine coming up
A	okay
B	so there were the two deputy's job available
A	yeah
B	and we really wanted one of the senior masters to to get one of the jobs
A	mm
B	but they interviewed obviously they had to interview they brought in a whole team of people to interview
A	mm
B	blah blah
A	mm
B	had run a department somewhere else and she was ready for head er ready for the deputy's job blah blah
A	yeah
B	all of the governors sort of
A	she gosh
B	she got the job
A	mm
B	against it
A	yeah
B	erm
A	right
B	so that
A	right
B	other job
A	right
B	so he got erm
A	right okay interesting
B	and she got
A	yeah
B	the pastoral
A	part of it
B	deputy's job
A	right
B	and
A	mm
B	oh she was flouncing here flouncing there didn't
A	mm
B	teachers and their salaries
B	oh
B	year aren't the year heads?
A	self-marketeer
B	aren't the year heads doing that?
A	yeah
B	oh no no well I I need to speak to the
A	oh
B	okay anyway this went on there were several examples of this erm
A	yeah
B	and
A	always very handy the school librarians yeah
B	the school librarian
B	the
A	yeah
B	came for supper
A	right
B	to the house for supper
A	mm that's a odd question yeah
B	he said
A	god that's awful
B	and they were supposed to be paid monthly they hadn't been paid since I left in the July
A	oh I see right okay
B	she never
A	okay
B	for some reason
A	oh really?
B	yeah
A	to get rid of her?
B	to actually get rid of her
A	yeah
B	and it was so bad that it cost the school a third deputy appointment
A	gosh
B	because it took them so long to actually
A	do it yeah
B	prove that she was incompetent
A	mm
B	and wasn't doing the job and wasn't there to do the job
A	mm
B	they ultimately appointed one of the other members of my old team
A	mm
B	to deputy head she upgraded her to deputy head
A	yeah
B	to cope with the work
A	gosh
B	but this is what I'm saying is
A	mm
B	very with it
A	mm
B	all the paper qualifications
A	mm
B	oh if she did a Youtube presentation of herself my goodness me
A	oh yeah
B	which she was doing
A	yes
B	this is what I've
A	yeah
B	this is why
A	yeah
B	you know? and she was an absolute disaster
A	yeah yeah
B	as soon as you put
A	yeah
B	butch
A	yeah
B	fabulous the the how to organise
A	everything ran like clockwork
B	because she was
A	yeah
B	organised
A	mm
B	not everybody liked her
A	mm
B	but it didn't matter
A	didn't matter that's the point
B	she wasn't there to be like
A	yeah
B	and I've always said that
A	mm
B	look
A	right
B	you're not here to be liked
A	mm
B	if
A	yeah
B	if you are liked
A	yeah
B	it's a bonus
A	yeah
B	but that's not what you're aiming for
A	yeah
B	you're aiming for respect
A	yeah
B	respect of your position
A	mm
B	and if they like you
A	yeah
B	because of your you and your personality
A	yeah
B	on top of that
A	mm
B	you've got it made
A	mm
B	but
A	no
B	it it it's about respect and and
A	no
B	you
A	mm
B	yes
A	we have we totally have what a wonderful conversation well for me personally
