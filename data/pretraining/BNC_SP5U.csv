A	so how was
B	oh so busy
A	really busy?
B	so busy
A	cos er that's cos it's Friday
B	I thought I'd never get a car park place but I just got the first one I saw
A	mm
B	but er crowds and crowds
A	you knew it was Friday
B	it was quite horrible
A	I didn't know you were planning to go out
B	well
A	I don't know I just didn't know you were planning today
B	is she? oh that
A	yeah
B	was quick
A	she's home
B	oh well
A	yeah
B	oh
A	I hope there's someone that goes in to make sure she's alright though
B	well I expect
A	they will have someone go in
B	mm
A	yeah
B	well
B	mm
A	mm
B	I mean her leg'll never get better will it?
A	I don't think they'll
B	no
A	you don't heal do you?
B	no
A	at a certain age
B	no
A	yeah
B	mm
A	you don't hear about that any more
B	no you don't
A	there's these odd things that you
B	mm
A	it's in the news isn't it? and then all of a sudden you never
B	no
A	like the swine flu and
B	yeah
A	mm
A	they were giving everyone injections
B	cor that's another thing
A	mm
B	one was for I forget what the other one was
A	I see flu and shingles
B	and shingles
A	mm
B	I said no I don't have them
B	seems strange though but apparently when you get to a certain age you're entitled to have em
B	and I'm at that age
A	weren't you entitled to have a flu injection earlier then?
B	no
A	ah
B	mm
A	mm I'm not having it
B	no I said I don't want it
A	heard so many horror stories about how ill you are
B	well er what's-his-name have it don't he? er
A	yes
B	mm
A	he's been fine ever since
B	but does that mean you got to have a flu injection every year?
A	I don't know
B	well no not just once you start do you have to back it up? like years ago when we had tetanus injections when we were kids
A	yeah
B	you had to have a
A	mm
B	and then they sent you a letter to say go and have another booster about twenty years later
A	yeah
B	and then they say there's no need for it
A	mm
B	has tetanus died out in
A	did didn't it?
B	one of my friends at school died of tetanus
A	yeah
B	well he
A	can't you?
B	er he yeah you can get
A	on a thorn
B	on a thorn but you you got it's in in the soil
B	and it lives a long while in the soil
A	yeah
B	and that was firework night
A	mm
B	and they went off
A	yeah
B	and then he had to go straight to hospital anyway to have his burns
A	burns
B	sorted out
A	so did he survive alright?
B	no he
A	no? mm
B	I said one of my friends died
A	yes you did er sorry
B	at school

A	people letting them off everywhere weren't they?
B	they jumped all over the place didn't they?
A	trying to get to your legs
B	and
A	mm
B	and they'd jump
A	yeah
B	jump and set the fireworks off
A	yeah

A	beautifully done
B	I've never seen a display like that now they just have
A	mm
B	all these these huge firework displays that cost enormous amount of money and all you can see is up in the air ain't it?

B	we
A	didn't have er seatbelts then

A	right
B	but that was a stupid thing
A	oh yeah
B	but there weren't er that was only along this track and
A	only for a tiny while
B	yeah
A	yeah

A	well they are bluey
B	yeah but nothing like a bottle are they?
A	they're quite beautiful actually aren't they?
B	well they are when the sun shine on em
A	if you look at them
B	it won't be for long if we get a fly swatter

A	yeah
B	don't they?
A	yeah
B	well they probably are ain't they? probably are
B	er?
B	and they're just waiting for someone to swat them so they can be where they gotta be

B	has it? you put it in already?
A	no er but it's already in a curry sauce isn't it?
B	yeah
A	I know I know it was quite mild cos it's been watered down by all the tomatoes really
A	just gives it a little bit of
B	yeah it did
A	mm
B	I hear if you have too much chilli that take away the flavour of everything else that's on it
A	yeah
B	I mean these people who think to eat raw chillies
B	oh what a stupid idiot
A	yeah
B	what is the point?
A	I wonder what he's doing now he was kind of strange wasn't he?
B	yeah
A	mm
B	he came round here once or twice didn't he?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	not sure why
B	I'm not sure well we did we did carry on

A	okay
B	and then
B	yeah
A	and soya milk
B	yeah she did
A	right
B	but she used to buy all the stuff as well
A	mm
B	and I I think it's so strange though that you know she'll remember everything that that I used to do you know
A	does remember a lot doesn't she?
B	and this is a long while ago now ain't it?
A	yes
B	and er
A	whereas I
B	I never realised how much they people appreciated me going round selling stuff
A	mm
B	because at the time it wasn't the norm to buy all this whole food stuff was it?
A	no
B	all them years ago
A	strangely enough people were only just thinking about what they were eating
B	yeah
A	weren't they?
B	yeah
A	just beginning to think
B	yeah that's it yeah
A	that they don't want all these er rubbish foods
B	they did a they did a thing about er chemical
A	yeah
B	fungus and all that sort of stuff
A	mm
B	but once they're safe to eat there's no difference in the organic or the
A	really?
B	yeah
A	mm
B	that's what they say
A	yeah
B	but er I mean they tell you they tell you a lot of old bull don't they?
A	well er that's cos they want you to carry on buying the stuff otherwise
B	yeah
A	otherwise er everything would rot wouldn't it?
B	I see
A	yes
B	he writes it on now yeah
A	well it's obvious really that they were stock feed you don't buy a whole huge bag full of carrots do you? like sack of potatoes you don't buy a sack of carrots you can't eat them
B	no you can't no we did didn't we? we
A	so
B	we bought we bought a sack oh I think it was about twenty-eight pound of carrots
A	and wasted em
B	and most of em went to waste didn't they? they just melt away don't they? and go rotten and go
A	yeah
B	soft and just go into water don't they?
A	mm
B	and they stink
A	they do
B	on er when they got that rot they are yes
A	yeah they are
B	and when you when I used to sell potatoes
A	yeah
B	all this gunge
A	er
B	ah
A	mm
B	right
A	what shall we do before tea? anything?
B	well I'm going in the shed
