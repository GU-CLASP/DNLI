B	yeah
A	anyway so you were saying?
B	did you see that
A	they've got really good meat there by the way if you wanna get some good steak
B	I don't
A	oh you don't
B	don't eat it
A	yeah
B	don't eat it
A	did I see what?
B	did you see the red moon last night?
A	no
B	really?
A	yeah I
B	why was it red?
A	er it's I heard somewhere it's some kind of eclipse
B	cos apparently it's er it was very early at night it was like half six or something
A	yeah
B	and erm if a full moon which I didn't realise
A	yeah
B	and er
A	yeah
B	she was playing with her phone as usual
B	and all her friends were sending these photos of this red moon
B	well
A	yeah
B	well that's what happened last month wasn't it?
A	yeah?
B	yeah
B	erm it was because it was closer to the earth than any other time
A	oh
B	yeah it was in the papers and everything and you know you know people are amazed how big the moon was
A	yeah
B	so another one you missed
A	cos I think yeah I think sometimes as well if you're in the desert I think the sand in the air can magnify it it acts as like a glass
B	yeah
A	kind of magnification thing
B	oh
A	so it looks like something in Star Wars like this big big thing
B	what for a red moon?
A	I don't know how often are they?
B	I've got no idea
B	I never seen them before
A	no
B	well
A	or you just saw pictures of it?
B	I just saw pictures of it
A	yeah
B	yeah cos when we were I mean it was too late because I was er I well I presume it was too late I
A	yeah
B	cos all these pictures that we saw that take about half a six and
A	yeah
B	when
A	yeah
B	really cheap actually
A	yeah?
B	yeah
B	for oh ninety minutes and very
A	yeah
B	er and then worked up to your knees
A	yeah
B	and erm then erm that
A	yeah
B	and erm
A	right
B	I mean
A	mm
B	on the rare times she cooks
B	and they put strips about so long er on your back which overlap just on the the lower back
A	mm
B	and then she brings in these they look like huge joints
B	two
B	er that are attach with this clip and then proceeded to wave them about between one and two inches above the back
A	mm
B	and this is the heat I felt I I I thought it was wax
A	mm
B	that was being poured on my back I didn't I I
B	and there was this this is the heat and er it's a it's a bit whiffy you know it's erm a bit strong smell smoke in the air
A	yeah
B	but
A	yeah
B	yes
A	oh good
B	well
A	so they're
B	no no no this was the last thing they did
A	right
B	they do the massage first I think to loosen it up I suppose
A	yeah
B	I
A	yeah
B	so
A	oh okay
B	and that's
A	I know with Taoism there's some some types of smoke I can't remember which ones but they're supposed to be cleansing er you know take out the impurities
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	I was supposed to have a stomach massage before the back one but erm erm I didn't want that in case of getting a funny tummy you know
A	yeah I don't really like stomach massages it's kind of
B	mm
A	I dunno there's too many things there to prod isn't there?
B	well
A	like no I can't see what the good that does really massaging your stomach
B	mm
A	I suppose you can move stuff if it's blocked but
B	mm
A	on your back or legs or something
B	well I felt mm
A	yeah
B	and erm in fact I went down the
A	yeah
B	so did I I thought cos a er what I was scared of I was gonna get the the pancreatitis was gonna come back
A	oh yeah
B	and I didn't wanna get that back in the hospital especially since I don't have medical insurance any more
A	yeah
B	well
A	would you go to a Chinese hospital?
B	well well no I mean where I went before was an an you know in hospital but it was erm
A	mm
B	just this intravenous drip for five days sort of thing
A	mm
B	and then after that er you only sort of like stodge you could eat you know like porridge and
A	mm
B	other stuffs like that
A	yeah
B	so I've been a bit careful
A	mm
B	really?
A	well
B	really?
A	it was you know cos I'm not getting that much sleep when I'm home anyway
B	no
A	and then work with mum work on Monday morning
B	oh
A	no I mean it's just not
B	yeah
A	yeah so I mean I I'm planning a gig tomorrow at

B	they've got a gig
A	oh
B	I assumed that it was you know it was in the evening but
A	yeah

B	oh
A	my I can pick up anything and get a song out of it but
B	oh
A	doing this
B	sounds very clever
A	erm well it's a clever programme
B	yeah I was trying to get my guitar fixed actually in the I was trying to tune it and the tuner didn't seem to work properly so I took it
A	get a get at tuner on your app
B	really?
A	yeah on the
B	when then no the one I've got you you attach it to the guitar
A	mm
B	and you pluck the string and it you know
A	yeah
B	go
A	this one you just erm
B	get it on your phone?
A	yeah
B	oh oh
A	sounds a little bit up there yeah
B	so how would I get this app then?
A	you just search it on the whatever search thing you've got on your phone I don't know
B	but mine my phone's not an er er a smart phone right?
A	but you've got apps on it
A	must be able to download them
B	I think I can er yeah I'll I'll have a look when I'm at home cos that only works like I think when the Wi-Fi's on
A	er
C	yeah?
A	I'm gonna shall I go and try and sing her do you wanna
C	oh it's
A	come in here for a bit?
C	yeah
A	and I'll I'll go and calm her down
C	okay
A	sometimes when I sing I think it's the vibrations of my chest or something
B	oh
A	yeah so
B	right
A	so the just the first that once a
C	yeah that's fine I've just
A	why's she windy?
C	I don't know I went and in
A	I I'll go in then okay
C	yeah alright
B	hi
C	oh
B	teeth probably
C	do you think?
B	mm yeah that or tummy ache I remember when we had babies in the family not mine but when I was younger you know I was a teenager and other people had babies it it's and erm those it was either well people were talking about either teething in which case you put stuff on the gums or gripe water for tummy ache
C	yeah yeah I've read about that see I meant to bring some Bonjela from the UK but I forgot
B	oh
C	it's fine we're fine so how is everybody how is
B	well erm she's still got this acute bronchitis
C	mm that's been a long while
B	I know well it's like it's acute you know it it's turning into chronic the know chronic is usually associated with smoking mm
C	it's just when it's is it when it's recurring quite a lot?
B	well yeah
C	when it
B	yeah it's it's just it she can't seem to get rid of it some and we've been giving her medicine and stuff but and that's
C	antibiotics or
B	no no we went to the hospital last week with her and erm the doctor said no that it's it's not what she needs so erm she had some erm cough syrup and er a couple of different types of pills and it seemed to get better a little bit better but it's worse at night
C	right
B	at bedtime
C	yeah
B	but er it's it's it's I mean it it's just constant coughing and coughing and coughing and
C	wow that's
B	I mean it's it's I mean poor thing you know
C	yeah
B	if if it's her suffering but it drives me round the twist as well you know
C	yeah yeah
B	this constant cough but cos it she forces it the
C	I think
B	a er you can't stop yourself she's doing it because she's got this thing in her
C	mm
B	up here she says on the top of her chest and she's trying to dislodge it
C	right
B	no but er apart from that she's happy enough
C	yeah
B	you know
B	and the well yeah yeah and she's developed this nervous twitch as well
C	that's habit that yeah
B	mm see is everything alright at school? yeah yeah no problem so I don't know why she's doing this
C	the teachers say anything to her?
B	yeah yeah
C	mm
B	we had to give them presents for teachers' day
C	oh did you?
B	I said well why do you do this we don't have to he said well if you don't they don't treat
B	no
C	I got my first apple
B	so we ended up paying erm er got
C	twenty quid? really?
B	yeah
C	that's quite a big present
B	yeah and there was
C	cor my mum and dad only
B	there's four teachers
C	my mum and dad only give
B	I know yeah
C	mm
B	oh really?
C	yeah I've never had
B	oh what for the teacher?
C	an apple on the desk before
B	mm
C	no
B	mind you they pay enough for the courses so
C	but also
B	it's like
C	cos the teachers they came at the beginning of term so you've got a new teacher
B	mm
C	so it's not like he's a
B	well she's back in er no she's back at the same school she was in before
C	right so she had that teacher before? cos
B	well but yeah but there are four different teachers so yeah
C	it's a bit weird to have a teachers' day at the beginning of term they should have it at the end of the year and then if er if you feel like you're you've had a good year with your teacher then you can do something if not don't
B	yeah
C	you know? it's a bit
B	yeah think it's up to the parents anyway it's got
C	yeah
B	don't think kids have got any say in it
C	what did you get?
C	no I've done one
B	you've done one
C	mm
B	so I'll just put your name down
C	mm yeah that's fine
B	mm right
C	are you very busy it's been really busy for us oh ah
B	er?
C	it's been quite busy
B	mm
C	we get the end of the day with her as well when she's tired
B	yeah
B	but I thought the idea was
C	yeah yeah we are so they're coming back but there's a lot of marking lately so
B	mm
C	do bits and bobs as well so bringing work home doing a bit of work at home I get distracted so easily I just wanna know what's going on in the other room
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	I certainly miss the money and you know the and the company with the and all the rest of but the the contact with the kids but I certainly don't miss the marking and and
C	yeah
B	having to get up at seven o'clock every morning
C	see I
B	mm
C	and doing bits but now
B	mm
C	and come in cos I've been coming home to spend some time with her and then doing bits in the evening
A	I picked her up
C	picked her up
A	and she had loads of wind
C	really?
A	so I think that's what might be why
C	you're much better at the wind than me
A	yeah
C	he is
A	it's what I eat
C	er? yeah you're better at getting rid of it
A	getting rid of the wind
C	so she should sleep now once she's asleep she's fine
A	yeah
C	but it's difficult to know whether she
A	yeah
C	she's got so many emotions lately that I think she might start crying to get cuddles
A	mm
C	extra cuddles you know?
A	that's the problem
C	did
B	what's that?
C	cry for attention
B	yeah
C	people either leave them to cry
B	I don't know
C	or they go in to them but
B	yeah
A	yeah well she's getting that age now I think where she's gonna start really playing with us a little bit
C	I don't know
A	anyway you need to go and do your work
C	I know
A	shouldn't be marking in the evening anyway of course
B	the marking
C	I know I've got to get organised to not do it in the evening
A	yeah
C	yeah I know
A	I like that idea
C	yeah
A	cos you're gonna drive yourself into the ground
C	I'm already tired
B	mm
C	yeah cos
A	it's cos you've been coming back to breast feed
C	come back every lunchtime
B	yeah?
C	I'm getting really fit
C	running back
B	well get yourself a bike
C	no I've borrowed
B	you should do
B	ah oh well you ah you've got a bike
C	I need to pump it up but I'm still a bit scared to ride it aren't I? I was gonna practice riding round the park for a little while but I'm not very good on a bike you see
B	oh
C	no but I'm gonna practice for a bit but I've just gotta pump it up haven't even got a bicycle pump
C	yeah I can
B	well did you do what I suggested go to the the bicycle man and ask well ask him to get you one?
C	yes I know I know but I haven't got myself over to that street to the high street
B	it's not exactly far
C	it is
B	oh yes
B	it must take all oh nearly five minutes
C	but I don't have time because I go to class in the morning then I come back here at lunch then I go back to class and then it's four o'clock and they're then nanny finishes at four o'clock
B	you should get yourself a bicycle
C	I
C	oh oh yes I will do it next week
B	well I mean cos it wouldn't be as healthy if you got a e-bike but it would be quicker and they're not expensive
A	mm
C	mm
B	they're about two hundred quid so but you have to charge it and all the rest of it but er
C	mm
B	and er but now er I I cycle home which takes twenty minutes and you know I I take I cos I've got
C	oh that's good
B	a checker and erm

B	well
A	yeah cos then I can I can download the er the thing I use to download stuff as well so you'll be able to use that
B	here we are House of Cards
A	but everything else worked alright? just that one was it?
B	yeah the other two were alright I still can't remember what the other film was the third one
A	mm
B	one you gave me was about the Wall Street walls oh connect to disconnect
A	no
B	erm so
A	okay so it's MP4 maybe that's why what programme are you using?
B	ah
A	I don't know I'm not sure if MP4 works on Windows Media Player
B	well that's probably the reason then
A	yeah I can test it on my one actually
B	well that's all pixelated but
A	have you got a VLC on your computers?
B	I don't even know what that means
A	okay I'll it'll take two seconds it's
B	there see? oh this is it freeze
A	yeah I don't think it can play MP4s
B	got to change again and change again
A	er
B	of course there's no sound
A	yeah erm I should be able to fix that
B	shouldn't there be sound coming from the computer?
A	er it depends
B	anyway you see what the problem is so you might as well stop it
A	mm yeah
B	okay
A	yeah see if I can get this programme on the stick I can put it on your computer
B	well I might as well take this off and delete this because I can't watch it
A	no leave it
B	yeah?
A	yeah I can put on a programme on your computer that will
B	oh
A	it'll work
B	oh really?
A	yeah that's why I'm getting now
B	oh
A	erm in theory
B	okay
A	er
B	have you got Wi-Fi here?
A	yeah I think your computer should be connected anyway shouldn't it?
B	mm managed to connect it to the Wi-Fi at my house
A	have you not used it here before?
B	I've bought it here before for you to install stuff on it but I don't think it actually
A	okay

A	yeah that one
B	this one?
A	yeah
B	no
A	yeah right click?
B	right click
A	er no
B	troubleshoot problems no
A	ah it should work if you click on that mm cos you normally choose your
B	not connected
A	connections are available yeah click again ah
B	yeah
A	connect you're gonna need a password
B	no unable to
A	oh why? cancel that
B	not sure I mean I mean what's that saying that only you and your computer you can use it?
A	no maybe cos when we've got the baby monitor on sometimes it it affects the Wi-Fi signal
B	mm
A	let's try it again connect it it says it's connected yeah you must have done it here before it should work
B	ah
B	in my lucky draw
