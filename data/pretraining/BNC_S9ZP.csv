B	well we we did that when we were in Hong Kong
A	mm
B	and we went there and it was awful absolutely dreadful
A	ah
B	and there weren't many people in there I'd just thought we'd chosen wrong

A	mm
B	change in society isn't it really?
A	oh very much
B	what we eat and what we do our lives
A	yep everything's changing well it's like most places in the world everybody's becoming more American you know?
B	mm
A	it's er cultural colonisation
B	oh I
A	and it's insidious the you know people don't realise they're becoming more American erm
B	no no
A	but er it's undeniable
B	but
A	true
B	and you know you certainly didn't you heard saw the odd American film or something
A	yeah
B	but now
A	but that's why I think it most of it comes you know through films and TV shows
B	films and things yeah mm
A	and that's why I I you know as a teacher I have noticed in the way that language changes and the way people speak and most of it
B	yeah but I mean it whatever you you think about language there there is a mixture of all languages isn't there? in our you know
A	well there's nothing pure about it
B	in our society
A	and erm language is a living thing it it changes
B	changes yeah
A	and I suppose it's natural that older generations don't like change so much and but we do take it all take it on board er I I try and er resist a lot a lot of changes that are taking place but I find myself as well years ago in well of course we didn't have emails then but erm
B	is say hi
A	yeah
B	I say hi in all my emails I never say
A	yeah well there you go
B	I never say
A	mm
B	cos it's a bit more formal
A	well depending on er who er they call it register don't they? you know to who to whom you're talking erm
B	mm I mean even to my boss who's at work I say hi
A	yeah yeah
B	rather than hello or
A	mm
B	or sometimes hello but it's kind of erm
A	but even even in sometimes in business letters er people address each other by their Christian names and never and never either met or erm
B	yeah I wouldn't I wouldn't ever to someone I didn't know I wouldn't say that but someone you work with or
A	mm
B	I wouldn't say it to my principle but I'd say it to my boss and my line managers

B	does he? mm
A	mm
B	see I prefer to do the
A	mm
B	I quite like to get up and get going not not every day but most days I think otherwise you're when you stop work your routine goes and so you have to do something to
A	mm
B	keep that routine some of you know
A	well yeah it's about the old thing I I do enjoy about not working is the having to get up when you
B	no mind you if you've got
A	well yeah
B	you're gonna be
A	mm
B	mm
A	mm
B	pardon? yeah but I'll I'll when I go to bed I'll start
A	mm
B	I go to my office as
B	I sit there and I'll er you know try and formulate some it's very difficult for me though cos I don't know
A	well it's very selfish
B	is she?
A	mm
B	well therefore you know
A	no I didn't realise it but she is
B	hm?
A	first few years I didn't realise
B	mm
A	I noticed just after
B	hm? after
A	mm
B	began to see it
A	well when she was a baby she she still wanted to to go out started going out like she did
A	yeah
B	and yet you said she wanted more children?
A	yeah that's part of the Chinese culture
B	mm
A	I I really don't know
B	mm that would be awful for
A	well I can't see that
B	would she? mm
A	well it's terrible they live on
B	is it?
A	yeah horrible I mean the toilet is a hole next to the pigpens you you're squatting there over the hole and you've got pigs grunting behind you
B	and
A	I shouldn't think so
B	why why would she take
A	well well because this problem with school in
B	mm
A	we haven't got the right
B	to go to school
A	to to go to school there
B	and yet she has down there?
A	well yeah cos that's where she's born she
B	where
A	yeah
B	but not
A	well no no
B	mm
A	looking after everyone
B	what's it what's it what does it cost to rent a property there then?
A	well the flat that we were living in before I came over er it was er nine hundred quid a month for two bedrooms
B	nine hundred pounds?
A	yeah
B	mm
A	for a month? for a two-bedroom flat?
B	yeah
A	is it?
B	yeah that's what
A	is it?
B	mm
A	yes but they're not rising so much as here because er the property developers er were all counting on this never this boom
B	what in in China?
A	as commercial
B	mm
A	and people are waiting for the bubble to burst
B	mm
A	they it was certainly I mean the stabilisation I should think well it depends on the area of course
B	mm what about the flats that you've got
A	no it's in it's not very er commercial area and er the the value hasn't really gone up er
B	they are?
A	mm
B	why did you buy in that area again?
A	well that's that's where I was working and that's where er
B	oh right yeah yeah
B	mm mm
A	I I had no idea I'd be moving on to university
B	mm mm
A	and of course I like along with everybody else I thought well invest for the future
B	mm mm
A	very er only er a hundred pound each a month
B	you only get a hundred pound
A	each
B	that's odd isn't it?
A	yeah well
B	is is that is that
A	it's a very small it's only like er well a one-bedroom flat
B	they're small?
A	small small flats
B	mm mm
B	thriving
A	yeah
B	mm
A	absolutely
B	mm
A	mm
B	erm
A	I've got no idea er it should be quite cheap though
B	mm
A	yeah should be
B	well
A	well the school won't be as good because this is er fairly upmarket establishment that's
B	mm private
B	mm
A	lots of people got kids in there and
B	mm?
A	lots of people have got their kids in there
B	mm
A	and er
B	no
A	it was actually started apparently by a a guy who started out er rummaging through dustbins and rubbish bins and sort of selling stuff or that kind of thing and er he just built it up built it up er and then
B	but how would he how did he start it then?
A	well I I don't know the details but he started making a lot of money and one thing came to another and er eventually er created this school it's huge absolutely huge
B	mm
A	yeah but there's so many wealthy people over there its got
B	mm mm
A	but it's like most places in the world the the gap between the rich and poor is ever widening
B	mm of course yeah
A	I don't know about other private schools really er there's erm one I think another one that the er the the head guy in universities his wife worked in it's called the international school and I think their prices were er quite high as well
B	so so five thousand is a
A	erm maybe maybe even more expensive
B	is it five is it how much theirs is five thousand a what?
A	pounds a year
B	a year?
A	mm
B	that that compared with what I mean obviously you're talking about your flat is what you pay here but a private school here would be astronomical
A	mm
B	in comparison
A	mm
B	I mean erm I think you're talking something like twenty thousand a year now prices
A	a year?
B	yeah yeah
A	wow
B	private schools are just over the top
A	really?
A	mm
B	that you know and so they've
A	mm
B	so and and that that this area is one of the best is not that we knew that or or that
A	ah
B	you know they all go to that school for
A	mm
B	you know tuition
A	mm
B	it's a very good school
A	is that warranted?
B	hm?
A	spending that amount of money on his education? seeing that he's gone into a a manual
B	well
A	oh was he? ah
B	yeah oh yeah and so's
A	is he?
B	oh yes and
A	really?
B	mm yeah yeah but erm they had to fight to get him in that school fight to get him a place there
A	oh
B	yeah
A	it's all Greek to him
B	hm? no yeah erm but
A	mm
B	but again it'll be sitting down writing a letter or keeping his book
A	mm
B	he'll have it all in his head he's so good with property very good
A	mm
B	and erm his his erm commercial properties are rented out and they have to it's ten-year leases they have to have enough money up front for collateral for him to rent them out for ten years
A	mm
B	in other words they could pay ten-years rent without
A	mm
B	and the repairs without
A	mm
B	erm that's why he chose he chooses that
A	mm
B	but
A	mm
B	he did all the wood flooring in that other house put in the kitchen tiled it all the worktops erm putting in a new did the bathroom a beautiful bathroom that last one and you know and he's now done loads of work on the garden can't build walls but
A	really?
B	really good yeah but erm you know
A	well amazing
B	mm
A	erm said do you know anybody
B	why?
A	well I've got my old one still it needs to be repaired the
B	mm mm
A	but the
B	is the key
A	yeah mm
B	mm have you tried putting it on it since?
