B	I was like yes we're just friends
B	and he was like oh are you sure because erm
B	he was asking me what hours I work and stuff and then he was telling me what hours he worked I don't even know what job he does
A	you don't think he's a drug dealer?
B	I think he is but I think he's MI5 or a drug dealer
A	yeah
B	no he's too bumbling for MI5 for Christ
A	yes
B	sake he's like
A	unless it's like the best act ever
B	yeah
A	like genuine the best act
B	the best act
A	yeah
B	he reminds me of Johnny English
A	yeah
B	er then he told me he was like do you have any pets?
B	no I haven't got any pets he was like I used to have a I thought he said ferret and I was like pardon? parrot African parrot
A	mm
B	he was very cool though he he was saying that it used to like it's has a brain of a five year old child like a general
A	yeah
B	parrot and it can hold like thirty thousand words so
A	shit
B	if it hears you speak it will practise it for a couple of days and then be able to speak
A	but it doesn't understand what it means?
B	no it just it's repetitive isn't it?
A	yeah
B	what's it called? copying
A	yeah
B	but yeah still pretty cool though
A	mm
B	it was like if you spoke to it it will be able to speak back to you in your voice
A	that's really scary
B	so it could speak his language his ex-wife's language and everything
A	what his ex-wife?
B	where's his ex-wife from?
A	how did you even know he did how did he bring up the ex-wife?
B	because I guess he hasn't got the parrot now because it had to be re-homed I guess when they broke up
A	oh I see so who married him?
B	I dunno
B	maybe it was a cover up because he's MI5 maybe she found out?
A	no well what did she steal?
B	yeah I dunno
A	I still they still he still hasn't had that window fixed
B	he has he has now
A	ah it's it's fixed now
B	just recently he said finally fixed my window
A	because when was he burgled? He must've been burgled
B	that was like when we first came wasn't it? like it was ages ago
A	well yeah it really was ages ago
B	because I remember thinking
A	it was definitely before the May bank holiday
B	I think it was in like March
A	yeah
B	I am thinking
A	it was cold because I was wearing my onesie
B	I always wear my onesie
A	oh fair enough I remember us both being in our onesies he was like
B	hey
A	I on Saturday made I was making brownies I don't know why I ended up binning them they didn't taste very good but erm and I had like I wasn't wearing a bra I was wearing a thin strap top these trousers so baggy trousers that strap top had cake mixture all over me I hadn't showered I was literally the grimmest you could ever be in your entire life and the window cleaner came to the door and I was just like hello
A	and you know when you just like no human being ever wants to see this or be seen dressed like this and you know when you both look at each other and you're like
B	now you know what I get get up to in my spare time
A	yeah now you know that I look like an utter slob when I don't have anybody else in the house
A	so I'm guessing you're not going to be alone with him again anytime soon?
A	he is very peculiar isn't he?
B	he is
A	he seems to be socially awkward
B	he is socially awkward like
A	yeah
B	sometimes he's fine and sometimes he's just like really weird
A	that's good
A	I think that's what
B	please help yourself to spinach if you'd like some
A	thanks
B	for god sake why don't they tell people this?
A	she rang the hospital and was like yeah is my dad here? and they're like who's your dad? and she said erm
A	yeah
B	shit
B	what a dick
A	I know
B	she's such a moron
A	yup and then no one had told my mum
B	they should speak to the home about this
A	mm mm
B	are they going to?
A	yeah
B	because
A	my mum's like given them all like her her details my dad's details
B	she needs to say that they need to be informed
A	yeah because that's horrendous
B	that's horrendous
A	for the hospital to not even know that you've had two children
B	what a dick she is
A	I know and then they tried to get hold of
B	yeah
A	he just had a very horrible stomach but it's just ridiculous how they rang
B	great
A	yeah
B	thanks for the heads up dick
A	yeah and my mum was just like what the fuck you didn't even know that that you didn't even tell them I existed how
B	that's awful
A	it's a complete joke
B	what a dick
A	and then they're arguing because grandad wanted to leave us money when he dies and
B	why does she want it all? I don't understand
A	because apparently she's poor or
B	I don't know why she wants it all but sure that's doesn't
A	it's because he wanted to leave us five thousand pounds each which for me and
B	yeah
A	and also she's got all these great grandchildren so she feels like she has to like distribute the money further
B	yeah
A	but that's her choice you know like that's not grandad's choice grandad's doesn't want to support his great grandchildren he doesn't really care that much about them
B	no
A	sounds horrible but he doesn't care enough but she's like you know it's just not fair I think all the money should go to us and my mum's like but he doesn't want that and she basically just being really dicky about it
B	moron
A	you know when you just look at your your own siblings and you just think I can't ever imagine being in a
B	I know
A	state with them as what they are
B	I never want to be like that with my brother
A	no
B	it's just so sad
A	yeah I can't imagine ever arguing with
B	no
A	because we both just be like if mum and dad die just split it
B	yeah
A	there'd be no question on well you know
B	it doesn't work like that
A	yeah it doesn't like that's not how it works you just everything you just half it it is like there's just no respect from the other person
B	no
A	yeah
B	I hate that it's really sad when it gets like that that's what happened when my grandma's mum died they got really funny about money
A	yeah
B	I mean to be fair my nanny did leave more money to others than she did to
A	but then I guess it's their decision or who to be executive
B	yeah exactly er
A	and there was this case in the news the other week that really annoyed me actually this woman went to court because her mum didn't leave her any money in her will because she ran off she got married and she ran off with somebody her mum didn't like so her mum basically cut her off and they never spoke they did not speak from the time the woman ran off with her husband until the time her mum died
B	yeah
A	so her mum was just like basically disowned her she's like you're not my daughter I don't really want anything to do with you I don't want to leave you my estate and it was like a lot of money and the daughter went to court to get it and you're just like mm I think that's really unfair
B	yes
A	because the daughter didn't deserve like she just didn't deserve the money you know it's the mum's money
B	yeah
A	she didn't like her mum she just wanted the money and you're just like
B	it is not good
A	yeah it's like her will the will should have been I think should have been final and it wasn't which I thought was really bad
B	what so it got over run?
A	yeah the will got overturned and the daughter got something like two hundred and fifty thousand pounds or something like that
B	yeah
