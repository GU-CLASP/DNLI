A	yeah
B	oh okay
A	and I don't think there's much culture in Leeds personally
B	well there kinda is but it's a bit different
A	yeah
B	oh yeah Manchester is much better than everywhere else the guy
A	but they were such Manchester blokes there was one
A	there was one
B	oh
B	really?
A	and he kept interrupting and getting the answers wrong
B	I would've thought
A	the captain had hipster beards but
B	yeah
A	this was like the
B	oh okay
A	yeah
B	yeah the guy
A	but the captain had hipster beards and a quiff
B	the guy that was
A	oh right so they were quite good lecturers then?
B	they were very good
A	and who organises it? the conference?
B	erm so it's English UK is the accreditation body for English language schools
A	oh that's right cos what's-her-name was gonna be original rep wasn't she?
B	who's what's-her-name?
B	er no I don't think so
A	oh right
B	they're regional groups so it's English UK southwest and
A	well she better be she been doing it for twenty years
B	no not no but all the people at
A	no organise the conference twenty years
B	no she hasn't organised the conference for twenty years
A	oh right
B	she's organised
A	oh right
B	and after all the lot the are normally just stuck in schools
A	oh right
B	like all the ones in
A	oh
B	whereas she was really good she
A	well no it's a
B	she managed to convince all the people by the sounds of it
A	well that's right when I was in the
A	yeah with really funny extrovert speakers
B	oh okay
A	limelight so if they gave her a bunch of flowers she looked really embarrassed and
A	she reminded me of your classic kind of Girl Guide
B	oh right
A	who was an expert fundraiser for the University of
B	yeah?
A	and they ended up going to Australia cos
B	oh wow
A	very quiet
B	yeah
A	in public but a great sense of humour and she could
B	well
A	so there's the key to getting the people to do it for free I've done loads of it actually
B	that's what exactly what she did
A	yeah
B	she was really good
A	right
B	so I wouldn't be surprised if she twisted a few people's arms while she was out there as well
A	yeah that's about it that's what you do
B	she was very good the the plenary speaker at the end of the day was very good he's called
A	mm
B	and things whoosh up to the surface and you have a epiphany moment
A	oh okay
B	and his example was his brother who's an English language teacher
B	it's funny he wasn't saying anything new
A	oh okay
B	so he'd read some book that's not to do with languages at all
A	right
B	and erm
A	yeah
B	come up with this whole presentation
A	yeah that's true actually it's just getting a different slant on it to make it entertaining
B	very difficult to bring up anything new he's
A	mm
B	erm and he's
A	erm the opposite to this girl
B	mm?
A	you know? two hundred three hundred people
A	hated networking
B	how funny?
A	so they were a funny pair they compensated very well for each other
B	yeah
A	and she was obviously a pretty deadly
B	yeah definitely
A	and he was the kind of the brains of it all
B	yeah
A	so
B	er no it's not it's for schools
A	oh right so the schools of the members
B	so schools are accredited er members
A	oh right
B	erm but
A	oh yeah you used to like those didn't you?
B	I used to really like them
A	right
B	cos I'd
A	right
B	erm
A	I think they'd be
B	the academic meetings are very good I really like them
B	so yeah that'll be once a
A	is she?
B	yeah well there's a activities one and she's by far the most experienced so she's now
A	well she's pretty active isn't she?
B	they'll
B	well she's a social programme person and operations so they must've convinced her to go
A	oh okay
B	so yeah
A	so what's
B	oh he's going back to doing erm
B	she reckoned that
