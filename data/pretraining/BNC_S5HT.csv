A	so hello again
B	hi hi
A	yeah what have you lost?
A	oh okay very good okay yeah so no I'm hungry now
A	yeah I know I am sitting down I'm sitting I'm sitting thank you
A	yeah ah the old knee is still a bit dodgy and I'm just hoping once I'm a farmer that it becomes erm like not a problem
A	but no I from what I can gather I need to build up that muscle there on my quadricep cos that one's overdeveloped and that one's underdeveloped
B	mm mm
A	so when I walk for an hour or more it pulls my kneecap out of alignment so it's all grating and then it hurts but anyway and I had a torn cartilage when I was thirteen
B	nice
A	it was misdiagnosed for three years because I was so young interesting factoid
B	yeah I've got well I used to have cartilage problems but as my
A	mm
B	it seems to be sorting themselves out
A	good
B	a little bit but yeah really common in athletes footballers especially have loads of problems with cartilage in their knees
A	mm how interesting yeah Arsenal
A	really interesting fact that I'm sure you're bound to retain
B	yes really
A	erm used to have the worst injury record in the Premiership now they have the best erm what's made the difference is was it last season? I think it was last season they took on the German World Cup-winning physio
B	oh
A	guy who erm tailors these workout programs for each individual athlete and so you get different types of exercise which obviously aren't suited to everybody because everybody is different
B	yeah
A	erm and so Arsenal are having fewer injuries and the injuries that they do have recovery is much much faster
B	mm mm
A	erm which I think is magnificent
B	mm mm
A	so it goes to show if you've got the experts that know what they're all about they can sort it out
B	yeah yes and I've had loads of personal trainers in my time erm some for not very long at all or some for quite a while or when I used to go to this gym regularly at home I was like the I don't know what the word is test dummy for new personal trainers
A	oh cool
B	erm so like the head trainer would come to me and go I've got a new person who's just qualified
A	mm mm
B	will you do a few sessions with them for free?
A	wow
B	erm and then you can say what's good what's bad what needs to change
A	mm mm
B	whether you like them or not as a person if they're professional if they know what they're talking about
A	it's good
B	erm so that was really good but only one person and that was the head trainer really sort of stood watched analysed said
A	yeah
B	you've got weak wrists you've got weak ankles blah blah blah blah blah
A	mm
B	work on this we can work on this do this do this erm and the rest just do you know generic things
A	yeah
B	to get you fit but they don't take into account that every person is different
A	mm
B	erm
A	so were these people that you were saying?
A	were they generally younger people? or younger lads just out of uni?
B	yeah yeah
A	not really
B	yeah I had someone and I was you know really pissed off if you're if these people are charging twenty or thirty pounds an hour
A	yeah
B	you're going for an hour then they make you run to warm up for ten minutes and you're going well I've just done that
A	okay
B	before I got here
A	before I got here yeah
B	cos I knew that I didn't want to spend the first ten minutes or first five minutes just walking on a treadmill for you
A	yeah yeah sixteen percent or
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	erm and just stuff like that and you're going
A	no it's annoying
B	or people who tell you about their holidays or tell you you know
A	mm
B	erm anything no don't care people sort of checking texts on their phone no bin them off
A	no exactly
B	erm and interestingly at this gym that I'm at now I've been you know watching the trainers
A	mm mm
B	for months to sort of pick the one that I wanted and
A	yeah
B	I saw him training somebody and he kept stopping to go and answer his phone
A	oh
B	and he's you know the owner of the company he's very very good probably as a trainer er and he's very important and they've just opened a new gym last week so
A	mm
B	lots of calls to deal with
A	mm mm
B	but you're getting paid
A	yeah
B	put your phone down
A	yeah exactly
A	yeah
B	and I thought before that I'd thought
A	you are the universe for that hour
B	before that I'd thought oh he'd be a good person I know I want a man and I want one who knows what they're doing
A	yeah
B	er and he's the obvious choice
A	mm
B	no definitely not
A	no good for you checking them out first
B	yeah and you know it's really sort of oh you're checking them out how they act around this person if they're paying attention if they're looking around the gym if they're
A	yeah
B	cos they've been going there since well the end of September erm some aren't and you're going it's not all the trainer but if I was the trainer
A	mm
B	but if I was the trainer I'd be pulling them up and going
A	yeah wasting your money
B	you're wasting your money if whatever you're doing outside of here isn't good you know isn't good for you
A	yeah
B	and expect more I'd expect the weights to be going up or whatever but it's not so you've got to really
A	is that sex going on
B	no I think they're watching a video
A	oh fair enough
B	you've got to be quite sort of analytical er so
A	mm
B	made a good choice
A	yeah good good and I'm really pleased that you're pleased as well cos I'm sure that adds to this woohoo January that you're having
B	mm mm mm mm yeah
A	of really making good progress it sounds like you've made a good connection with trainer guy
B	yeah yeah so I just feel good you know just ticking stuff off things that I've been meaning to do for ages
A	mm
B	like sort my nose out
A	yeah
B	and it's just gone on and on and it's getting worse and worse and you've just or I've just got to go right enough is enough
A	mm mm
B	erm
A	and you've done that now hurray
B	what's next? yeah so what's next?
A	yeah
B	next eyes
A	aha contact lenses
B	just going to have a whole new head by
A	I tell you you are not going to fall over at all when skiing
A	you are just going to be an expert skier when you can actually see where you're going see the icy spots see the bumps in the snow
B	se the ice breathe
A	yeah see the small children ahead of you
B	yeah with those super-strong legs
A	yeah the super-strong legs yeah
B	yeah so it's all coming together
A	that's so cool
B	and I know a lot of these things that kind of
A	mm mm
B	and not like I don't know
A	I think appearance-based things my personal take on it is where things are the last to manifest so anything that's been going on psychologically spiritually emotionally once you start sorting it on the physical like for example going to the gym or for example not doing your nasal thing that's because the change has already taken place on the inner
B	yeah yeah that's
A	so this is like the outer representation of what's already occurred on the inner
B	yeah
A	which is you know another great thing for you as well to think like with your nasal thing you've really kicked this
B	yeah
A	because it was last to manifest in the physical
B	yeah that's true
A	woohoo
B	yeah and it's
A	lots to celebrate it's really good
B	skin skin'll be next
A	mm mm
B	but I've made to you know I'm making the effort internally which is drinking water
A	mm
B	erm so hopefully it should sort itself out
A	mm
B	and I think you know not just
A	and the biggest thing being happy
B	yeah and yeah and not seeing sort of only positive thinking is gonna change this
A	mm
B	or you know? going it's going to change it's going to change but it's all part of the same
A	yeah and it has changed
B	yeah
A	so it's not it's no longer at a point in the future it's now at a point in the present
B	woohoo
A	I kind of feel like I need to have a big party for you it's like yay
A	yeah there's always work to do though I think that that's the point of life the universe and everything it's all a work in progress
B	yeah
A	no it's never going to happen and I think that's the key to it is to when you wake up to there is no destination
B	yeah
A	it's all about now
B	yes
A	yeah
B	and I think no me and my friend have been talking for a
A	mm
B	and we sort of said by twenty-five we want to be at peak physical mental blah blah blah blah blah
B	and like time's ticking
B	so you know it's not
A	yeah
B	it's it I'm not doing it because of that but subconsciously somewhere in there are these decisions being made because we made this promise
A	yeah
B	that we would do these things
A	when are you twenty-five?
B	April
A	April cool
B	so it's just like a normal
A	what date? will I still be here? yeah probably will
B	the sixth
A	yeah yeah I'll be about cool
B	so it's just after Easter hols or during the Easter hols
A	oh actually yeah I might not be back by then yeah I might still be on the return leg it depends on how much time I spend in Northern Ireland in March
B	yeah oh well we'll see we'll see
A	yeah we'll see
B	we'll see
A	mm when's your school holiday?
B	er I can't remember that I need to check
A	I thought it was over by April is it not like the twenty-third to the thirtieth or something? that's off the top of my head probably out of my arse I'm not sure
B	erm er twenty-fourth to the twenty-ninth
A	twenty-ninth yeah
B	but I don't know what days they are I think it's like
A	I think Easter Sunday is the twenty-seventh or something like that
B	it is yeah so that's the Tuesday so we'll start on the Wednesday
A	okay
B	so that's the thirtieth so we finish on the Thursday I don't know so Thursday to Wednesday
A	mm
B	so it's probably not enough time to get back cos the flights from
A	ah okay
B	so
A	flight from Krakow?
B	I'll have a look
A	mm
B	I hate flying from Krakow though I just think
A	mm
A	you are hilarious
B	I don't know everything it's all tied in to what we were saying about you know pay the money do it fast or pay the money do it comfortably er and with flying from Krakow
A	yeah
B	yeah erm you know pay I don't know anyway
A	mm
B	so we shall see anyway three minutes until
B	just keep
A	how incredibly English three minutes
A	that is so funny
B	I don't know why I'm so into time it's sort of social conditioning I think
A	yeah very possibly I I got broken off that living in Northern Ireland and in England and when I was part of the rat race I used to have breakfast meetings at like seven o' clock or whatever ridiculous time of the morning it was yeah
B	oh yeah you said this before in Ireland it doesn't work like that
A	no not at all you have a meeting at ten and if you were there like an English person arriving at ten to ten because you don't want to be late and then at ten o' clock you're still the only person there at ten past ten you're still the only person there and by half past ten everybody's arrived
B	yeah
A	and you're having coffee and tea and scones cos you have to have scones and it was almost an unspoken rule that while you're drinking tea and eating scones before a meeting you don't talk about the meeting
B	yeah only everything else
A	you talk about yeah everything about family or friendships or what you did at the weekend
B	yeah
A	and then the meeting will start about eleven so for a ten o' clock meeting don't expect to do anything before eleven but it's quite nice in a way it's a more relaxed lifestyle and if you think oh shit there's a bit of traffic I'm going to be five minutes late you don't need to bother ringing anybody
B	mm mm
A	you don't need to drive like a dick to try and get there all the sooner
B	yeah
A	it doesn't matter
B	we were talking about that this morning er with
A	mm that's so sensible
B	and people sort of cancelling last minute cos they just they go oh whatever
B	ah and I just thought that'd be awful
A	I think it's going to be kill or cure for you
B	I'd hate it I'd absolutely hate it but I think it's probably good for me
A	mm
B	erm
A	I used to be quite obsessed with time until I lived in Northern Ireland
B	yeah
A	and I still drove like an arsehole when I got there and can remember overtaking everything it was possible to overtake on
B	mm mm
A	and it was definitely from Northern Ireland I think had I lived and worked in Belfast or gone down south and lived and worked in Dublin it might have been different
B	mm mm
A	but living rurally working relatively rurally er all change
B	I don't know how I'm going to cope because I do
B	erm especially with time er and especially with you know getting things done and being quite not controlling but I like being in control and knowing what's happening
A	mm
B	knowing you know the plan or the situation
A	yeah
B	yeah and having that sort of taken away
A	so why are you going to Spain? why are you drawing this experience to you?
B	I need the sun
A	that I understand
B	really that's the only reason I just need sunshine
A	yeah yeah I think the
B	yeah
A	and
B	I suppose in this job you wouldn't be working at that time anyway
A	mm yeah I guess
B	if it's I don't know what time it will be one till three or twelve till one or something like that it wouldn't be
A	it's a few hours though isn't it?
B	mm
A	don't you work like seven AM to seven PM and have four hours off or three hours off or something?
B	I don't know
A	I don't know
B	but in this job anyway
A	oh there's
B	bye
A	say bye bye bye
B	bye bye
