A	ah yep so you press it twice
B	ah
A	it's recording now
B	thanks
B	so it was as simple as pressing it twice
D	okay right
D	don't worry I'm not very technical either
B	yeah
D	so don't worry about it
D	I think I've done like maybe ten or something like that ten or eleven
B	ah that's good
D	they're normally kind of with similar people like with my housemate cos we kind of I live with her but it's really hard to actually spend a lot of time with her
B	yeah
D	cos like I'm always out going to like the gym or something and she's always out doing something so actually pinning pinning each other down to spend time together that's really difficult
B	yeah
D	so I kind of use it as an excuse to like pin her down
B	yeah
D	and it's been really good so
B	oh that's yeah actually time to catch up in general anyway
D	yeah exactly
B	even if it's not like recording or anything
D	yeah
B	yeah
D	yeah exactly like
B	ah
D	cos we moved in together in January and then the kind of we just didn't really see each other for like four months which is really weird
D	she's my housemate but er and she's my best friend from school so
B	oh so you already knew each other?
D	yeah so it's been quite good that way and some of them with my mum but my mum rants so much and I've had to like stop it sometimes
B	yeah
D	cos she ends up having like an argument I'm like I don't want to
B	it's not it's not a conversation
B	it's just them talking for ages
D	it's just them ranting it's like this is not good mum
D	what are you doing? erm
B	yeah
D	I haven't actually done any recordings with any guys which I think I don't know if it's a bit weird cos I have quite a lot of guy friends but just
B	mm
D	I dunno I haven't made
B	yeah
B	no I think at the moment it's pretty even so it doesn't matter too much I mean
D	mm yeah
B	it's slightly more
D	yeah
B	speakers but
D	yeah
B	it doesn't matter too much as long as it's generally going balanced anyway it's fine
D	yeah
D	and you listen to it and you're like this this isn't even a coherent conversation
D	like what are we actually discussing? but
B	yeah it's quite good when you read it
D	mm
B	it totally doesn't make sense
D	yeah
B	but then obviously it made sense to you at the time like
D	yeah you need context
B	yeah
D	but it's really interesting to do what are you actually gonna do with the data?
B	we are just gonna add it to the
D	yeah
B	our corpus that we've got already
D	yeah
B	do you I don't know if you
D	I I know like bits of it but like is it you're just trying to track like which words people use and stuff like that?
B	yeah and how we erm just if it differs to how we write and
D	mm yeah
B	if it's changed cos we've got a nineties nineties dataset as well
D	yeah
B	so we're comparing it as well to see what
D	yeah
B	we check like what topics we talk about
D	yeah I've seen the board
B	yeah
B	oh that's good
D	that's really cool
B	yeah
D	yeah
B	erm
B	as much now than we used to and stuff like that
D	oh okay
B	but erm and then eventually we'll use it to erm like teach learners
D	mm mm
B	how we talk now
D	yeah
B	so they we they get taught up to date stuff
D	yeah cos like the French like I remember like the French I was taught at school was horrendously formal and didn't really make
B	yeah
D	any sense to a French person when we spoke to them
D	it was like why's this person speaking really formally?
B	yeah
D	like one of my friends here is French and like we were talking not in French but I was trying to tell her like tell her stuff we learnt and she was like people don't speak like that at all so
B	no no no when I was learning Spanish and
D	mm
B	and you you're really proud of something that you've learnt
B	and then you go to Spain and say it and they're just laughing at you like
D	yeah
B	what are you even saying?
D	like you obviously learnt these at school
B	yeah that's something like my grandma would say or something
B	cos it's just so old and not even like worth knowing any more
D	isn't
B	no
D	if it was it was a common phrase when you were like fifteen years old
B	yeah
D	now you're like fifty so
D	no I've never been very good at languages I always try and I just can't do it
B	oh really?
D	can't do it at all like my sister she's like she's a complete Einstein baby you give her a language and she'll try it she'll learn it and she'll pick up words
B	yeah
D	and by the end of the day she'll be able to formulate sentences and everything if you ask me like no
D	I just can't do it I can like
B	yeah
D	I think in German like my godparents are German so I've been going to Germany every year for my entire life and all I can say is can I get down from the table? and can I have some water?
D	that's pretty much the extent of my German
D	so yeah you can tell that I learnt it from a child
D	so
B	yeah
D	that's not it
B	yeah well they say like you have to have a certain brain for it
D	yeah
B	or like so
D	yeah
B	I I dunno if that's actually true but
D	well
B	mm
D	she her brain just can't process maths or it can't work out how to solve a problem like that
B	yeah
D	but in languages she just completely clicks with it
B	yeah
D	so yeah
B	if you learn it you'd know it kind of thing
D	yeah
B	whereas you can't yeah I think
D	and like she's lived in like China and she's lived in France and she's lived in Germany and she loves like Japanese film like Annie May and things like that
B	mm
D	and she just she can just speak it and I'm just like how do you do that?
D	and she's a tour guide so she does tours
B	oh wow
D	in
B	yeah oh that's good
D	I'm just like how do you do this?
D	oh did you? wow
B	I did Spanish and Chinese at uni so
D	mm mm
B	I actually need to like practise my Chinese cos I haven't done it I finished uni last year and haven't done it since so
D	mm
B	erm not not as hard as I'd thought it'd be actually
D	yeah
B	like we were writing essays in it like in the first year and stuff
D	oh wow
B	obviously like really short essays like I love him and
B	my family I have like two
D	yeah
B	brothers or whatever
D	still it's like
B	yeah
D	all of the erm what are they called? symbols they're really I tried to like I did like a term of Chinese
B	mm
D	and I kind of failed miserably but
D	it was yeah it kind of they're not words are they? they're like symbols and symbols that represent things
B	yeah
D	and that translates into a meaning and that yeah
B	yeah
D	mm
B	so a
D	yeah and you can combine them
B	or it can yeah
D	mm
B	or it can just be one word if it's like and or something
D	have you ever been to China? did you
B	yeah I went to
D	oh
B	yeah where was your
D	er
D	yes
B	oh where the
D	the bit where the
B	explosion thing was oh my god was
D	yeah the explosion happened when she was there three years ago now I think so
B	oh okay
D	she's not there any more but
B	so she's fine
D	yeah that's where she was we went to visit her for two months and then we travelled round and went to
B	oh
B	mm
D	I'm not gonna lie China wasn't my favourite country
B	well I
D	wow
B	and I was only cos I was at university there
D	mm oh yeah
B	so we had to we had to go to university
D	mm mm
B	cos you have to have like a special visa or something
D	oh yeah
B	but you can't get that visa unless you've got a
D	yeah
B	and obviously I hadn't at the time I was it was
D	oh yeah
B	it was like my year abroad at uni
D	mm mm
B	yeah so had to go to uni and I was had to go to all the lectures otherwise you'd get like kicked out of the country basically
D	yeah they're really strict aren't they?
B	so I couldn't do much travelling I only went to a place called erm
D	I've no idea
D	yeah
B	but I didn't get to see like any of it
D	oh
B	I went
D	oh that's like
B	cos I had to go to
D	I don't I don't regret going
B	so that's really annoying
D	like cos we saw like the terracotta warriors and the pandas and we went to
B	yeah
D	and that was really interesting and all the things I see or I saw I'm really happy that I saw
B	yeah
D	like the great wall but I don't think I'd rush back
B	no
D	there were some culture things that I was a bit like
B	it's quite where I was it wasn't as developed as like
D	mm yeah
B	so it was a bit of like woah this is like culture shock I mean
D	yeah
B	and like by the time I'd got settled it was time to come back again
D	yeah
B	cos six months really isn't that long
D	it goes so quickly like we're in September now
B	yeah
D	and it's just like oh my god
B	I know
D	it was my birthday on the twenty-third so two weeks ago
B	yeah
D	how am I another year older? that's a joke
B	I know
D	I know but that's really sad
B	I know I used to like I used to ask my mum how old she was when I was younger
D	yeah
B	and she was like I dunno like thirty-two or something
D	yeah
B	and I was like how do you not know how old you are? like you keep
D	yeah cos it
B	but now I understand cos I don't even know how old I am
D	I know someone's like my sister's two years older than me and someone the other day said like how old's
D	why don't you tell her where
B	maybe she's twenty-four
D	yeah she's she's a few years older than me that's all I know
D	but I
B	oh
D	he's a bit he genuinely he's going off cycling on his own
B	oh really?
D	like I I kind of I'm doing the
B	oh wow
D	and then it's his birthday on the fourteenth of September and I'm taking the day off so I was like I'm taking the day off when it's your birthday we can do something
B	yeah
D	it's like I don't want to
B	oh not even like a dinner?
D	no
B	dinner
D	he was like we can yeah he was like we you can make me some like food or a cake or something but I'm going cycling I was like great okay dad
B	oh
D	that's nice like I took it off to recover not really for his birthday
B	yeah
D	but it was kind of like made me look good as a child
B	yeah
D	I was going for daughter of the year and it just failed it was like oh
D	yeah exactly
B	see he's I guess he's you still get him like presents and stuff though
D	erm
B	or do you not?
D	not really he's not really a present person
B	oh no
D	I think like maybe three or four years ago me and my mum and my sister all clubbed together to buy him an Ipad and it was like six hundred quid and he was like why do I want an Ipad? it literally on Christmas Day
B	oh no
D	he opened it and was like
B	oh
D	why do I want this? and we were like oh god
D	yeah we tried so hard genuinely it was like dad
B	yeah
D	what so my mum had it
D	so I was like that's nice at least it's not going to waste
B	yeah
D	but all she does is play Candy Crush on it
B	oh no
D	it's like
B	I didn't even start getting into that
D	no
B	cos I probably wouldn't have got off it
D	yeah
B	mm
D	and you play a game on it all the time
B	mm
D	she does literally nothing else with it apart from maybe some emails so like that's a
B	yeah
D	worthwhile six hundred pound investment there mother
D	yeah
B	I don't use it for like emails or
D	no like I have my phone and have a laptop I don't even use my laptop
B	no I don't really use mine
D	like I got it at uni so I started uni in two thousand and nine and finished two thousand and twelve? yeah so it's like maybe a good what? six years old now and it just takes so long well not really long it takes like a minute to load but it's like
B	yeah
D	it's a long time
B	it's longer than an Ipad
D	yeah it's
B	like we're so impatient aren't we now?
D	yeah exactly yeah
B	it's like why are you taking so long?
D	and like it's just a bit of an old laptop and by the time I've got it loaded and up and everything and the battery's I was one of those stupid people that left theirs charging all the time so now it has no battery
B	oh yeah
D	so I just I don't even use it any more and it's just sitting under my bed and I really but then you don't I don't really need it any more cos I have like a computer at work when I need to check things I have my phone
B	yeah
D	that's about it really and even now TV's have the internet on so
B	yeah they do and you can yeah cos I used to use my laptop at uni for like Netflix and
D	yeah
B	to watch like TV and stuff on it
D	mm
B	but and to do my work and I don't need to do any of that on it any more so
D	yeah exactly yeah and you can get Netflix on the TV which I love
B	yeah
D	although it took me a while to work out the other day how you log off someone else's account and I have to
B	I don't even know how you do that
D	yeah
B	I just have mine signed in all the time
D	exactly
D	yeah that's what I do cos it's
B	yeah
D	and her boyfriend came over and they obviously logged out of my account and logged into his account had a very peculiar erm name and I was like I'm guessing it's
D	but erm and I was like how do I get out of it and she goes oh you just sign out and I was like
B	oh simple
D	how do you do that?
B	yeah
D	I'm so bad
B	well I
D	mm
B	oh maybe I could watch that?
D	yeah
B	and then still scrolling and then I just get lost I'm just like
D	yeah
B	do you know what? I'll just watch telly or something
D	yeah that's what I do if I'm bored and I
B	yeah
D	but I've started I had like a New Year's resolution this year to complete series because I always end up like watching like the first how many
B	yeah
D	and then never finish them so I started
B	yeah
D	Daredevil they had like a Netflix original Daredevil
B	oh okay
D	and oh my god it's taken like five months we're finally up at
B	oh yeah?
D	but there's only ten episodes I was like oh god
B	oh together?
D	yeah
B	only one a month
D	I just couldn't do it
B	two a month can't do maths
D	you know when you're just like why am I watching this?
B	yeah
D	like I don't even it's okay but it's not like
B	yeah
D	makes me go yay
B	I I I watched the only one I've watched all the way through is Prison Break have you seen that one?
D	yeah I've watched that as well yeah
B	that's good
D	again I had a little bit of break in between
B	yeah I think that I was in Spain when like during some of it so
D	yeah
B	and you can't get it out there
D	yeah no you can't can you?
B	no
D	unless you use like erm a VN no a VPN?
B	VPN
D	VPN yeah
B	yeah and it was the same for China you can't be on anything in China so
D	no
B	so I had to have a break then
D	mm
B	and only watch watch it when I got home
D	yeah
B	but and then I started watching Twenty-Four
D	oh yeah
B	but I've only watched like the first six episodes or something
D	yeah
B	and haven't watched it for about three months
D	that's this is a really stupid question but there's twenty-four episodes in each
B	that makes sense
D	yeah
B	yeah cos each one's an hour
D	yeah
B	yeah that makes sense
B	yeah that's the only thing
D	and you're just like that's a lot that's a lot of my life
B	yeah
D	I
B	I've started watching Lost again but that's even worse that's ridiculous
D	oh did you?
B	it's got like thirty episodes for each season
D	oh good god
B	and there's like eight seasons I dunno
D	mm that's why I like erm I like quite like
B	I love New Girl
D	New Girl is so good oh my god I love it
B	did you watch it last night?
D	erm
B	was it on last night?
D	yes yeah
B	the shop
D	she was going out with a British guy now
B	yeah
D	but I still want her and Nick together I genuinely really want them to be together
B	I was so happy when they got together
D	yeah me too
B	like last time
D	I was like this this is really weird and don't judge me for it but I erm I have to like Google what happens in a series so I know vaguely how it ends
D	I know cos I don't want to like I really like Nick Nick and Jess and I really want them to be together and I was like if they're not going to be together I don't know if I want to watch it
B	yeah just be sad
D	exactly so I googled it and realised they were together so it's fine I watched it and loved it and then they broke up I was like oh no
B	oh no
D	but then I've seen a guy recently and he liked New Girl and I was like come on just tell me cos he's seen it all and he I was like you do they get back together? he's like I'm not gonna tell you but maybe
D	yes
B	I'm watching it only because like I like is it his name Ryan or something?
D	oh
B	the British one
D	the British guy yeah
B	I like him he's alright but
D	mm
B	I just like
D	it's not the same
B	he shouldn't be with Jess like why is she with him?
D	yeah and I mean
B	so I'm just watching it just cos I wanted to watch them break up and then
D	yeah I want them to
B	get back together and
D	yeah he was like well mm you'll have to see maybe it's no one's really sure it's a bit undivided I'm like they have to get back together
B	they have to
D	they just have to cos they just work so well
B	yeah
D	but although I do think it's very weird that they still live together and yet still have a very good relationship I think if I lived with my ex-boyfriend
B	mm
D	I would hate it if he brought other girls home or dated other girls so
B	yeah
D	yeah
B	it would still be really weird
D	be weird yeah
B	and
D	but I just love them so much
B	not yeah
D	and I love all the characters there's not like there's not one that I have a favourite I just love all of them it's just so good
B	yeah
D	although
B	I can't even remember oh cos they er Winston they were like
D	new yeah the Winston they wanted him to like get stabbed or something
B	yeah yeah
D	so stupid
B	oh dear I'm not sure like I'm I think I'm fine with Schmidt and Cece not being together like I'm not sure how
D	yeah
B	I don't want them to be together as much as I want Jess and Nick to be together
D	don't worry I'm not I'm not gonna tell you
B	oh do they get back together? do they?
D	yeah
B	oh
B	that's fine
D	he proposes
B	oh does he?
D	yeah
B	ah
D	but then in real life the person who plays Schmidt's just had a baby
B	oh really?
D	yeah and he's got blonde hair he does not look as good
B	huh?
D	he's kind of like highlighted his hair he looks a bit weird
B	oh no
D	but I can't imagine him being a dad dunno I think it's cos of his character he's really immature but
B	yeah yeah
D	I assume he's absolutely nothing like Schmidt cos Schmidt is crazy so
B	yeah I always think that I was thinking it last night actually like I wonder what they're like in real life
D	yeah
B	and if I'd actually like them more or less
D	I think I'd like them less just because you like their character so much don't you? I dunno
B	yeah that's true like
D	yeah I have a he's not really a friend
B	oh right
D	I haven't seen it or I've seen him like once and he's not a very good actor sounds horrible but he's not
D	and his name in
B	mm
D	he's like an Indian person and erm in the show he plays a nerd like a really geeky shy person and genuinely in real life that's exactly what he was like
B	oh really?
D	so when I like saw him on TV it was just like well he's just playing himself
B	yeah
D	he was really weird to see
D	I sort of watched it for like five minutes and like no can't watch this
D	I was like you're just not very good
D	I apologise if you like Eastenders
B	no I don't watch it
B	I dunno who you're talking about
D	yeah he's just I think yeah it's just cos when he was at school he used to like brag about it so much so I watched it I was like there's a reason I don't watch this show turn it off
B	has he been in it for ages?
D	yeah since I was in sixth form and so since yeah about two thousand and eight I think he's been in it
B	oh yeah
D	so quite a while
B	yeah that is a long time I suppose
D	still haven't watch it
D	never going to I think I watched it like years and years and years ago but can't really remember
B	mm I only watched it
D	yeah
B	my like
B	and then we like we watched it with her
D	yeah
B	but I don't actually purposely put any of them on
D	I don't actually watch any
B	oh do you?
D	yeah
B	I was so my boyfriend's cousin watches it and she like rants on about it all the time and I'm like I didn't even know
D	yeah it's definitely still going they had their thirtieth anniversary this year yeah
B	did they?
D	yeah
B	oh wow
D	like me and my housemate we like watched it it's like you know when you have like your best friend and
B	yeah
D	Neighbours is like one of our weird things that we do together so like
B	yeah that's fine
D	we could like have like have a few months break sometimes and then the other person might watch it and
B	yeah
D	it's one of those things you can not watch for months and you put on and you know exactly what's happened
B	yeah
D	it's not it's a bit shit to be honest but it's really good
D	it's like awfully bad no
B	yeah
D	awfully good
B	yeah
D	I dunno something like that but yeah
B	yeah but sometimes like
D	yeah
B	you do just wanna like know what happens next and
D	get really involved don't you?
B	yeah
D	well it's really weird like I always think it's strange erm when you when like a character dies and then like people mourn them you're just like
B	yeah
D	why are you mourning a character?
B	yeah
D	but then I realised you know I think it was two days ago Harry Potter's son apparently started school on the first of September there was like a
B	what his real son?
D	no no
D	it's like a character erm it was in the news like J K Rowling was like oh Harry Potter's son is starting school today good luck and it was basically like
B	oh
D	a fictional concept that Harry Potter
B	oh
D	is now old enough for his son as cos like at the end of the last book or something
B	yeah
D	James went to school or one of them went to school and that was his first day at school
B	they did have kids they were sending them on the
D	yeah
B	Hogs Hogwarts Express or something weren't they?
D	and apparently continuing the whole fictional story he he went to school on Monday and that was that was in the news and I was just like
B	that's so weird
D	what?
B	really?
D	he's he's a fake
D	yeah
B	but I didn't read it
D	mm
B	and I thought she was just doing like a sequel or something
D	yeah no no it was just
B	but it was just that
B	oh no
D	I know
B	what? I thought he was like twenty-five at like the most
D	yeah I was like cos I assume I read it when I was in like when I was ten or something so
B	yeah
D	I was like early two thousands I kind of assumed it was he was like really young
B	yeah
D	like my age cos when you read it you associate you associate yourself with him
B	yeah
D	yeah
B	you feel like you grow up with them so he should only be
D	yeah
B	our age now
D	exactly yeah and you're just like oh Harry Potter in the fictional world is really old
B	yeah
D	great
D	I just didn't understand how this fictional character just meant so much to people but
B	mm people get really like attached don't they?
D	really into it yeah
B	what like what would they
E	hey how are you two?
D	good how are you?
B	shall I stop it or shall I just
E	carry on that's alright what have you been up to? just having a chat?
D	just having a chat about
E	oh no
B	and people get so did you hear about the er Harry Potter's son started school on Monday or something
E	no
D	did you not? oh it was in the news
B	and apparently people got like really like ah like
E	excited about it
D	yeah
B	and like saying good luck to him even though he's only a fictional character
D	like genuinely was really weird
E	that is mental
D	why do people even care?
B	it is isn't it? yeah
E	yeah and what?
D	yeah exactly
B	there's there's nothing else to say like what?
D	no it's like and people just like ha hope you're having an amazing day at school wish I was there it's like it's not real
D	what is wrong with you?
B	she's got to do a sequel now where James is at Hogwarts
D	yeah but the thing is what could happen?
E	it's just gonna it's just gonna ruin it
D	mm
E	just just stop
B	yeah just stop
D	that last chapter completely just was wrong anyway like she shouldn't have written it
B	mm
D	I think or she shouldn't have written it so like cheesily I dunno
B	yeah
E	mm
D	but yeah
B	I think it's just to like end it somewhere wasn't it like
D	yeah
B	I've got to end it otherwise it'll just carry on for ages
D	yeah
B	mm
D	and I think she kind of had to do like a bit of a loop and end it
B	yeah
D	on like a nice notion like an American ending
B	yeah
B	but I think like as we were saying like the fans grow up with him almost
D	yeah
B	like obviously he grew a little bit quicker
D	yeah
B	erm but so maybe her audience like changed anyway cos
D	yeah yeah would have done
B	we
E	yeah
D	yeah
B	like we started watching and reading it when we were younger and then we grow up we
D	mm
B	obviously didn't want it to be like childish any more
D	no
B	some people might
E	just imagine having that idea though and it just
D	I know
E	exploding and the whole world is suddenly in your imaginary world it's a bit like
D	yeah
E	woah there
B	yeah
E	like it must be quite weird
D	and also judging your imaginary world like oh I wouldn't have done that like that or that's wrong or
B	yeah
D	that wouldn't have really happened hypothetically it's like it's fiction
D	like
B	just let it happen
D	yeah just leave her to it
E	yeah just all the
E	I'm just gonna go and see what's happening but erm
B	okay
E	carry on
B	have we?
D	everything's full
B	yay
D	cos it must be so hard to get people to come in and like participate in things
B	yeah we it's at first like we were doing almost an hour at first we were just stood there like
D	ah
B	twiddling our thumbs like no one's coming but then we were like it's fine people go and have their lunch and then they'll come in
D	they'll come
B	but I mean it's not too bad I we we're getting a few in so
D	yeah
B	a lot of people say they'll do it and then have like don't turn up so
D	yeah
B	you can't judge like how many people are actually gonna do it
D	yeah cos
B	yeah
D	something like that and you're like okay this isn't really gonna work tonight so
B	yeah
D	it's like obviously didn't have to
B	yeah
D	yeah
B	and we just generally forget like
D	yeah exactly
B	we finish lunch but like oh should have recorded that
D	yeah yeah
B	so we totally understand that it is hard
D	mm mm
B	to like do it all the time
D	but it's still yeah like I say it's nice to get people together
B	yeah
D	do you mind if I just have a chat with you and record it?
B	yeah
D	and I think it's quite funny at times cos you first people notice they're being recorded so they say things and they're like
B	yeah
D	and then actually they get like really relaxed into it and then they come out with like a complete
B	yeah
D	crappy like bollocksy sentence
B	yeah
D	and start swearing and they're like oh crap was I supposed to be able to swear? damn it
B	yeah
D	but no
B	yeah that I think
D	yeah
B	but it's not even the topics it's like the you're aware of the topics but
D	mm mm
B	the way you say it is the bit we're interested
D	yeah
B	which is the bit that you can't really help so much
D	mm mm
B	like whatever you say it's gonna come out
D	mm
B	almost naturally anyway so
D	yeah yeah
B	you can't adjust it too much
D	I know it it's strange though when you're saying about how whether the written word is different from the spoken word because mine is so different like
B	yeah
D	I am very British in my emails I think like I'm very not formal but I'm very like nice and like
B	yeah
D	I do a lot of fluff and I use you know like I could definitely have like
B	yeah
D	I can reduce my sentences dramatically by just taking out words and making them less nice and stuff
B	yeah
D	but then when I speak I can try to like I dunno I just yeah and not as coherent
B	yeah
D	emails always much more structured aren't they?
B	yeah and you can go back and like change what you've done or something
B	when you can't when you're talking
D	yeah I'm definitely one of those people that get halfway through a sentence and they're not really sure where it's going and then kind of just have a little break
B	yeah
D	I'm like damn it
B	yeah but I think it like we know we speak differently to how we write
D	yeah
B	but it's just kind of like seeing what the differences actually are
D	yeah and also the different situations
B	like can actually categorise it
D	like this morning I was like over the weekend I was having a bit of an argument with a friend of mine and we had like a little chat this morning about it and in the way on the drive here I was trying in my head to like formulate how I say what I wanted to say because I was like I don't actually know how to say what I want to say
B	yeah
D	to get like the meaning across so like I think difficult situations I have to definitely think and like formulate and just plan what I'm going to say
B	yeah
D	whereas like normal chitchat I can waffle on about anything
B	yeah yeah that's true actually that's a good point
B	I never thought about that unless it's just a spontaneous argument then it's different and
D	oh yeah
B	you go back afterwards you're like I should have said that
D	yeah yeah damn it
B	but yeah if you know you're gonna like have a
D	yeah
B	you can plan it
D	I don't I'm not really like an argumentative person so I I don't think the only person I think I've ever had a proper shouting match with is my mum
B	yeah
D	never had a proper shouting match with anybody else
B	no I don't think I have well like my sisters or something
D	yeah
B	like nothing
D	like a part of me really wants to you know like in films and you see like somebody throw a drink over somebody
B	yeah
D	I'd love to do that
B	and just like yeah just smash things up
D	yeah
D	I'm the person who's like oh god don't break up
B	yeah
B	when they do like that on the table
D	yeah
B	switch everything off you're like
D	that's
B	I'd love to do that but I wouldn't want to cos
D	no
B	everything's in order
D	and there's
B	yeah
D	they just knock it off the table and the coffee goes everywhere and they're like
B	yeah
D	I'd be the one like cleaning all the coffee
B	like broken my best mug or something
D	yeah
B	like shouldn't have done it
D	no I wouldn't say I'm OCD but
B	yeah
D	kind of contradicts yourself really doesn't it?
D	I think everyone has their OCD moments
B	yeah
D	like mine is I have to have matching pegs when I hang out washing
B	oh do you?
D	yeah it's really bad and eating Skittles is a bit of a disaster cos I have to like colour coordinate them
B	oh do you?
D	yeah
B	do you have like in different pots?
D	yeah I have like a little lines then like odd ones I have to like have
D	I once spent ages doing it and my ex-boyfriend just went
B	oh no
D	it's fine
B	I like things just to be like tidy I think and
D	mm
D	yeah
B	wow your desk is really tidy I was like is it? it looks a mess to me like
D	yeah
B	everything's not in order at all and he was like no it's really tidy
D	one of the girls in my team
D	I've tried to model my desk on her desk and it's just failing
B	oh no
D	it's just not looking the same I dunno how she does it but my housemate is also called
B	mm yeah
D	like and all her DVDs like
B	she knows where everything is kind of
D	yeah
B	yeah
D	and it's just everything's just so well organised but just in a very small room I'm just like
B	yeah
D	how do you do this? how do you make a room look so homely
B	mm
D	cos I'm the opposite I am very like minimal
B	mm
D	like I hate clutter so
B	yeah
D	you walk into my room it's just like white walls
D	and now there's just pictures everywhere
B	yeah I don't mind a lot of stuff as long as it is like neat and tidy or like
D	yeah
B	hidden or
D	mm
B	I'm not like
D	yeah
B	no I don't
D	just the yeah but like
B	mm
D	stuff I'm one of those people that either really loves something or really or like if I'm shopping and I see a dress that I love I kind of have to get it
B	yeah
D	if not I won't be satisfied
B	yeah
D	but if I'm trying
B	oh really?
D	I have to really like it
B	yeah
D	same as like anything like cake
B	yeah
D	like
D	no
B	just get rid of it
D	yeah I'm really bad like that
D	just like apathetic about anything I don't really really like
D	but
B	that's fine though cos as least then
D	yeah
B	you're not like oh I shouldn't have got that or
D	I don't and spending like
B	oh no
D	and get loads of crap and she'll be like well I kind of liked it but you know
B	yeah
D	they were only five pounds so I bought it I was like that's five pounds you could spend on something else
B	yeah yeah
D	it's like you could put it together and buy a really nice pair of shoes
B	yeah
D	yeah mm
B	or something cos otherwise I know I'll just never wear it
D	yeah yeah
B	cos there's nothing
D	yeah
B	and I'll probably wouldn't buy anything to go with it for a while so it'd just be pointless
D	yeah
B	do you?
D	like Kurt Geiger heels rock my world
B	oh
D	so I just see a pair and I'll buy them and I actually I've got like six or seven boxes under my bed and I genuinely don't wear them I just
B	oh really?
D	have them and they don't like one pair doesn't even go with anything I own but I just wanted them
B	mm
D	and they were on sale
B	yeah they might eventually
D	one day they will
B	yeah
D	one day I wore them with an outfit that didn't even match just because I really wanted to wear them
D	I was like I have to wear these shoes
B	well I took my I've got a twin and
D	mm
B	she's like that she will just she's got she's got so many pairs of shoes it's ridiculous and like when she moved out she kind of went through them all and
D	yeah
B	like took some out
D	yeah
B	they're all like black heels with like a strap or something or
D	mm
B	something really similar and like they're all the same colour the same style and I'm just like well how did you have that many of those in the first place?
B	it's like totally ridiculous she was like but that one goes with this outfit
D	yeah
B	and not the other and I was like they're pretty much the same
D	yeah they're identical
B	yeah
D	do you ever like nick your sister's shoes? or
B	not that cos she's got smaller feet than I have
D	ah annoying
B	but two of my other sisters like bit we're all like the same size
D	yeah
B	so we just like swap and change
D	yeah
B	it's harder now I've moved out
D	yeah
B	but I still like ring them up and like can I borrow these shoes?
B	or like can I borrow this top?
D	yes
B	oh really?
D	I can't I don't
B	mm
D	there's like an odd piece I'll be like I really wanna borrow that
B	yeah
D	so I kind of
B	yeah
D	I'm just gonna nick this for like a day
D	no it's good but I've got erm as people well not people but as my friends remind me I have really big feet I'm like size seven and
B	mm that's not that big I'm like six or seven
D	yeah well that's what I thought
B	yeah that's right
B	ah thanks
D	make me feel
B	yeah
D	about my feet
B	but
D	yeah
B	feet and she doesn't look out of proportion
D	no
B	but she say she
D	mm yeah
B	but it's like it's fine
D	yeah
B	it's not wrong
D	yeah I've never looked at someone's feet and been like what a weirdo
B	yeah they don't they're not in proportion at all
B	who is in proportion really like?
D	exactly
B	did you ever try and buy shoes in China though?
D	er no
B	cos I tried and
D	were they not good?
B	they just don't
D	yeah
B	they do them like at size five and that's big
D	oh god
B	yeah
D	no I didn't really buy
B	mm
D	oh erm
B	no
D	she was like can you like post me some bras please?
D	it was like yeah that's fine
B	yeah
D	mm
B	like they just don't do them but even though like people are changing some of them are some like
D	yes
B	Chinese people are really tall now like really big so
D	yeah
B	I think they are changing but it's still hard to buy stuff
D	mm
B	yeah yeah
D	one of the things I don't know whether you found this probably not where you stayed but do you ever find that when students come over here they wear like the most poshest clothes to go to uni like
B	mm
D	proper like suits and like
B	yeah
D	heels and it's just like what are you doing?
B	I know
D	I'm in like pyjamas or like jacket with jogging bottoms
B	yeah
B	yeah
D	like looking like I've just crawled out of bed cos I probably have just crawled out of bed
B	yeah
D	and they come completely immaculate with hair done and handbags and you're just like
B	yeah
D	what are you doing?
B	I think they must be like cos when I was in China
D	mm
B	there were a lot of them that I
D	yeah
B	a lot of people that I saw weren't in clothes like that so I guess they're like
D	yeah
B	the super rich cos and they
D	mm
B	cos they can afford to come over here to uni they can afford to buy
D	yeah yeah
B	clothes like that or something I don't know
D	yeah
B	and like
D	it's weird
B	yeah I dunno
D	yeah it just makes me feel a bit like
B	it's like you don't have to dress like that to go go do you
D	yeah
B	yeah no
D	but no it's very weird
B	oh okay
D	and it's it's a bit weird I'm not gonna lie
D	but erm he's into it and so he takes photographs of people dressed up and some of they costumes they've got on are like they spend thousands of pounds on them
B	really?
D	and they take hours to dress up and they do all their makeup and their hair
B	oh my god
D	and they look like they end up looking like dolls and things like that
B	oh no
D	and yeah I know
D	and it's just like there was so many other things you could spend your money on
B	yeah there's
B	yeah I would definitely want to spend my money on something else
D	yeah
B	I mean I don't mind spending money on clothes and stuff but
D	no
B	not like that
D	no exactly and
B	mm
D	yep yep
D	also look quite weird
B	yeah
D	like when they dress up you know like erm Comicon
B	yeah
D	I'm like people dress up in like a full outfit and it's like that's very impressive but erm
B	yeah as it were
D	bit bit weird
B	yeah
B	I'm not into fancy dress at all really though
D	no
B	I don't really like it
D	no
B	yeah
D	now I've just gotta make the effort and go and get like get an outfit
B	yeah
D	yeah you do
B	because you're the only one I remember I think it was like last Halloween or the Halloween before yeah the one before
D	mm
B	erm my boyfriend's cousin was having a party and we weren't gonna go cos
D	yeah
B	we were in London
D	mm mm
B	but then we came back from London and obviously we we're just dressed in ordinary
D	yeah
B	clothes and we just turned up and everybody was like why are you dressed up? it was like oh no we shouldn't have just
D	yeah
B	she should have just not gone like we tried to make an effort
D	yeah
B	by turning up and then it was just pointless
D	I think it's
B	it's like oh no
D	I think it's good if you went to like a huge party and everybody really got involved like the outfits were really impressive
B	yeah
D	and like everybody had like face paint or like you know they really got involved with it
B	yeah
D	most of the time I always go to parties that were like half arsed and like people end up looking a bit
B	yeah a bit makeshift rather than like
D	yeah
B	really good yeah
D	exactly well it's cos they cost so much money it's just like
B	mm
D	no not worth it
B	they do
D	no it's not
B	yeah
D	I'd much rather spend my money going on holiday to be honest
B	yeah
D	and going
B	me too
D	so
B	I always think that and like my cos my friend's getting married as well
D	oh
B	and
D	yeah
B	well more than she'd want to
D	mm
B	and I was like I wouldn't wanna spend that much on a wedding like I just want to
D	no
B	I'd rather
D	yeah or like on a house
B	or just yeah
D	yeah
B	something yeah I don't think I
D	where is her wedding?
B	erm in I think she's having the ceremony in
D	okay
B	erm she lives in
D	no
B	it's it's in
D	oh okay yeah
B	so the receptions back there
D	mm
B	which is quite far quite far it's like
D	yeah quite
B	yeah it's like thirty to forty-five minutes drive away
D	yeah
B	which is quite far I didn't actually think about that until now
D	yeah
D	sometimes you think why would you do that?
B	yeah
D	but no I always I always think weddings are slightly out like blown out of proportion it's like I'm probably gonna be the only woman who ever says this but I genuinely think weddings are just massive parties like
B	yeah
D	I don't I don't see the point of like spending that much money and I hate like all the like the white chairs with the ribbons round them I you know
B	mm
D	I just don't like it
D	yeah so
B	it'd just be like I'd be cringing the whole time like oh I don't like it
D	yeah
B	yeah
D	I think you have to say quite a few sentences but damn it
B	oh no
D	why can't I just be like I love you I want to marry you boom done
B	yeah
D	that's all I wanna say
B	yeah
D	I don't wanna like and when people start cracking out their own really long vows I was just like oh god
B	yeah no one else everyone's just that
D	yeah
B	yeah
D	and just start crying
B	and just say it to yourself like to each other in private no one else needs to hear it
D	exactly
B	yeah
D	what is it they've got to spend like three or four weeks apart?
B	yeah
D	and then they start crying it's like I've never spent a night without you it's like oh good god like just
B	mm really?
D	go away already
B	yeah
D	no I'm not like that at all as you can I'm not really a romantic
D	and
B	I went to a wedding at the beginning of August that's what this wristband's for
D	ah that's cool
B	they had like a festival wedding
D	that's really cool
B	it was actually really cool like
D	mm
B	it's the only wedding that I've actually really enjoyed myself
D	yeah
B	they had had a normal well they had a ceremony like a orange grove
D	oh yeah
B	from it's based on the Elbow song er Starlings or something
D	yeah
B	and it was their favourite song so
D	yeah
B	they got married in an orange grove and then we went back to like a field and they'd
D	yeah
B	set up these like massive tipi tents they had a stage for different bands
D	that's really cool
B	that were playing
D	mm mm
B	had like a bar tent type thing as well
D	yeah
B	and we all stayed in erm a tipi
D	yeah like glamping
B	glamping yeah and it it was actually really good it was all weekend
D	yeah that's really fun
B	and that but even still like the vows were a bit cringe cos they'd written them themselves and they were really long and we were just all like
D	oh god
B	oh
D	wasn't it something like Kanye West like
B	forty minutes?
D	it was like I wouldn't even wanna listen to you talking for forty seconds so
B	no
D	it's like forty minutes no
B	no one needs to listen to that for forty minutes either
D	no
B	no
D	yeah
B	yeah
D	want some food? food?
B	yeah it's always on everyone's mind yeah
D	I dunno why I wasn't even hungry I was like food
B	yeah
D	so
B	cos we went back to the the festival field and
D	mm
B	there was like speeches and stuff
D	yeah
B	and everybody was sat round the tables like yep okay
D	yep good
B	it's a good speech but can we eat?
D	yeah and I feel always really bad for the best men cos they always have like erm you know people always have like a bet on how long the best man's speech is gonna last
B	mm
D	and whether it's gonna be funny and stuff
B	yeah
D	there's so much pressure on a best man I feel really bad for them
B	yeah
D	like maid of honour doesn't have to do any of that
B	no
D	but
B	yeah it was the best man at this wedding was really good but
D	mm
B	her the bride's dad did a speech as well before and it was just really like oh
D	yeah
B	it's like not erm cos the tradition is that you give away the bride
D	yeah
B	is your daughter
D	yeah
B	but I'm not doing that I'm welcoming the I'm welcoming the groom into my family and it was just really cheesy and
D	mm
B	everyone was like er?
D	I think my dad if I ever if I ever decide to get married my dad's speech'll be quite good cos he's like a really abrupt like sarcastic bloke
B	oh really?
D	and so and he was a best man years and years ago for one of his friends and he is my dad's a Brummie and his friend's was like a really common Brummie
B	mm mm
D	he's marrying this really posh woman
B	oh
D	and like they did they didn't last very long
B	oh no
D	but dad was the best man and he stood up and the first thing he said was give he gave the football scores and the bride got really angry
D	she had like a massive tantrum
B	oh no
D	apparently his speech was really funny but she did not appreciate it
B	oh no that's not I think you'd just have to go with it don't you?
D	yeah
B	like
D	they're men and they're from
B	yeah what do you expect?
B	oh dear
D	I know I would also think like I'd like if I ever get married I'd like to give a speech at my wedding
B	no that's true
D	yeah
B	like the groom did as well actually
D	yeah
B	I totally forgot about that one that wasn't very good
D	it was the groom the best man and the bride's father isn't it?
B	yeah
D	the women don't so I'm like a bit unconventional
B	yeah she's still
D	yeah
B	yeah
D	eat
B	yeah not gonna keep you any longer just eat
D	no
D	I'm hungry so so you must be too
B	yeah
D	no
B	ah
D	ah
B	forty-three and a half
D	oh that's really good
B	shall I stop it?
