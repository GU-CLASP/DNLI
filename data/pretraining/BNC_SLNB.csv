A	you should be
B	I'm down with da monarchy kidz
C	thank God for the NHS
C	oh no wait
B	huh?
B	I don't get it
C	as in it's hardly as if she's been relying on public health
B	oh right
C	unlike David Cameron
B	mm
C	I'm full of respect for him for that
B	fair play to him
A	the only thing I respect him for
B	I
A	bit of a creep
C	no
B	he's a bit  he's a bit  creepy but like I don't
C	well
A	he
C	why? Personally why?
B	he's he's no worse than any Labour politician like
A	mm
B	but you know all politicians are pretty bad
C	but as far as prime ministers go
B	I don't particularly like any of them
C	both him and Tony Blair
B	mm
C	I think they've got a certain amount of integrity
B	I was gonna say
C	for politicians is impressive
B	ah but he seems alright
C	you take what you can get
B	he doesn't seem massively bad
C	rape the entirety of the student population
B	and he yeah
C	of this country
B	get all the students to vote for him and then just go oh sorry
B	in the
A	nah
B	Cos yeah I mean  I mean  yeah I don't like him
C	okay
B	but he seems yeah
A	well have you seen the Tory budget?
C	yes
C	well the coalition budget I think you mean but yes
A	yeah
A	you know it
B	well
A	mm
B	say in it bless him
C	well no but he did in all fairness
B	ah no right no cos they did they brought in the
C	so it's er
B	lib Dem policy about um Lib Dem policy was the one about the um raising the threshold for taxable
C	no they both wanted to do that in all fairness
B	did they? Oh right
C	mm
B	that's quite good
C	oh so what else about the budget?
A	well just the fact that like they've screwed everybody over with it
C	er specifically how?
A	huh
B	there was the front page of The
C	you
B	Metro
A	there was er um
B	so
C	um well all they've actually done as far as that's concerned is freeze the increase on the tax-free um allowance for pensioners
B	mm
C	which is The Times commented yeah so it's gonna affect the number of Saga cruises that people can go on
C	big deal
B	large pensions
C	yeah
B	well
C	it's you know just cos you're a pensioner doesn't mean you know it will be decades before I'm anywhere near as well off as my parents
C	who er who shortly will both be pensioners
B	mm
C	they own a house which is valued at approximately a million pounds
B	yeah
C	you know
B	well there was a chart in The Metro showing how people would be affected by this
C	well you see um I'm
B	but
C	I have absolutely huge sympathy
B	well exactly
C	that's like I'm
B	you're doing alright
C	yeah
C	stop giving people free fucking contraception
C	well instead of giving them free contraception just er enforce them to be sterilized
B	oh God
A	I am quite in favour of free
B	mm
C	oh I
B	oh no no
A	see a problem with that
C	I see a problem with that when you can't get drugs which are potentially lifesaving on the NHS
B	I think it
C	contraception's free
B	I think it could be means tested
C	a chronic cystic fibrosis patient
B	yeah
C	you need to pay for the drugs that will keep you alive
A	but it's not as clear cut as kind of this this taking money away from that though
C	no
A	well in that case stop all the funding for the people who are drug abusing and alcohol abusing
B	mm
C	well but then you get into a question of mm virtually any medical condition other than genetically inherited ones can be said to be moderately self-inflicted
C	but the point being that your er contraception is an issue which is
C	in fact pretty much if you are using
B	I dunno
C	I mean I think it in practice it's a good thing because we don't want
B	people you know
C	well children get free drugs
B	oh fair er do you know what I mean
C	mm
B	certain drugs to kiddies with cancer
C	mm
B	I dunno
C	but if you're a woman it's your human right to have a child so you can have IVF for free
B	I'm I'm uncomfortable with that
C	fuck off
B	I've gotta say that I think  I think  like yeah it should be spent on
B	mm
C	the other unfortunate argument is we're many people have postulated across the years you know stop paying for treatment for people who have self-inflicted illnesses
A	mm
C	I E cancer from smoking
A	yeah
C	which is
B	which
C	not reasonable
B	it's not really the British
C	way of doing things
B	health system way of doing things
C	it's the American way of doing things
B	I was gonna say
C	it's um and secondly it's actually um cigarette taxes are often generally equated with funding of the NHS
B	yeah
C	tobacco taxes
B	hence why they won't ban
C	yep
B	smoking
C	well considerably more than the cost of each smoker the cost of er kind of twenty a day
C	the amount of tax
B	yeah
C	you'll contribute in your lifetime is sort of ten times that that your treatment will cost
B	yeah
C	mm
B	yeah
C	ah well
B	never mind
C	there was some commentator rather cynically said on the BBC website other day um it's actually in the Government's interest to make roads as inefficient and congested as possible
B	everybody
B	actually no not David Cameron
A	yeah
B	in his high vis jacket
C	no one would stop
B	oh
A	not poor Cleggy
B	hm
C	no
B	Cleggy
A	Cleggy
C	it just  it just
B	he has ruined the Lib Dems forever
C	no but it's just the fact that if he'd just said
C	it was  it was  just a matter of what he said
B	yeah
C	I'm sorry but in order to make this coalition government work I cannot deliver on my
B	mhm
C	that would've been bad but acceptable
B	idiots
C	yeah
B	huh
A	Don't worry
C	dear everything is politics
B	unless you do an English degree
A	or Classics
B	well look I was gonna say if English is purely sex and death for three years
A	classics is purely sex
A	yeah
C	they're all dead
A	you never talk about them dying though
B	unless it's the Romans
A	they love a bit of death
A	the Greeks thought they were immortal
B	who?
A	the Greeks though they were immortal
B	they thought they
A	themselves
B	as in the Greeks thought the Greeks were immortal? Right
A	well they didn't actually
A	do you know what I mean? They didn't have the same kind of attitude towards death as the Romans
B	hence it was just all about sex
A	mhm
B	pretty much
A	sex and religion
B	oh religion
C	see in contrast it's my job to enhance sex and prevent death
C	no literally
C	um so
A	oh dear
C	should've seen the condoms we were producing
B	oh
C	for some reason in the American market there is a demand for flocked condoms
A	for what?
C	flock
B	urgh
C	condoms
A	that is disgusting
B	that's disgusting
C	but er no but apparently it wasn't necessary just for them to be fluffy but they needed to have stuff painted on the fluff
A	bleurgh
C	well Louise was clearing out a desk and found a sample they were using
A	that is grim
B	who put this here?
C	yeah basically
B	boys?
C	no it's a product she'd been working on
B	nice
A	bleurgh
C	ours is a lot more fun
B	does sound quite fun
A	to be fair I've just been from
B	mm
C	they don't have class four lasers in Amsterdam
A	they don't
C	er
B	oh dear
B	why are you are whistling The Archers theme tune?
B	oh excellent
B	Miranda reference right there
C	oh it wasn't actually deliberate
B	really?
C	yeah
B	maybe it is just a natural thing that people whistle The Archers theme tune
C	oh yeah
C	is he having some cake?
B	um
C	resisted the urge to cake when we walked past earlier
C	I was very good
B	oo I'll have a oo actually I've got quite a lot
C	er
B	yeah so
A	I know
A	as opposed to?
B	as opposed to not pregnant
C	as opposed to miscarriage
B	yeah
C	quite a risk
B	it
A	oh
B	um she's got  she's got  a condition which means it was quite a high risk
A	oh I see
B	so basically that's why she thought she couldn't get pregnant
A	oh
B	Cos of this condition
C	well and unfortunately it makes it all the more serious if it does happen
B	yeah well exactly
A	how many weeks is she?
B	just taking care of herself
C	June
B	June
A	blimey
B	June

A	I've had loads
B	have you?
C	I want at least one more
A	I'm feeling quite faint from food
C	well get some more booze down you then
B	oh dear
A	round the corner from
B	round the corner from
B	her parents
A	father
C	can I try and do
B	mhm
C	hang on
A	what accent was that?
B	meant to be Mackem
A	oh
B	Owen
C	thank you for the support
B	um
B	oh
C	I'm sorry
B	no no that's fine
C	twenty pounds worth of meat well spent
A	no
B	no
C	can I have the er veg please?
A	mhm
B	yeah I mean that the carrots were from before and they were quite cheap anyway and
B	from er in the past
C	you dug them up
B	and a couple of onions don't cost
A	yep
B	but I mean er what the cost isn't the food it's the staff
A	hm
B	which costs a lot of money
A	yeah
B	hm
C	oy oy oy
B	oy oy oy
C	oy me oy
B	quite full
C	yes
C	um
B	just leave it if you don't want it
C	oh yeah
B	I'm hoping for a second wind
A	not as opposed to second wind
C	yeah I was gonna say let's hope that you don't get any more wind after earlier
A	have you changed your clock on your thingy?
B	yeah
C	yeah
C	changed all the clocks
B	the the heaters did it automatically
A	how could you tell?
B	Cos it's the it's an hour ahead of everything else
C	it's an hour ahead of everything else
B	jinx
A	oh
C	Cos
A	one clock you wouldn't realize that
B	I'd seen all the clocks
C	science
C	it works
B	sorry
C	well no it was  it was  the knee of the bad leg
B	oh
C	so that was fine
B	my big toe
A	toenail
B	toenail
C	fungal
A	you haven't got fungal toes have you?
B	I haven't got fungal toes
B	oh dear
C	so politics
B	oh God
A	does that mean that they'll what is there currently like a limit beneath which you could get fined for driving too slowly on the motorway?
C	yes
A	what's that limit?
C	um
A	or does it?
C	anything which is deemed to be dangerous
A	dangerous
C	in the conditions
B	mm
C	which is at the discretion of the police officer
A	oh okay
C	in free-flowing motorway conditions is er in my professional opinion that would be definitely fifty or lower
A	mm
C	as in you shouldn't on a clear motorway you should be up at the limit if it's safe to do so
A	mm
B	so if you're going along at twenty unless you're behind a tractor
C	it makes huge sense because people you are
A	mm
C	do that speed
B	so
A	but er
B	if they raise it to eighty what will be the?
A	that's what I was gonna say
B	yeah
C	well cos at the moment the er
A	mm
C	stop you for doing much more than eighty
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	so you know ninety er you know eighty-five to ninety you're asking for
B	yeah
C	um
B	yeah cos the speed limit was put in when cars weren't as safe so
C	yeah
C	that's mostly cos the cars couldn't go that fast
C	um
B	do we?
C	yeah
B	oh right
C	France is seventy-five
B	Germany's
C	er derestricted basically
B	yeah cos Germany's Autobahn
C	it's either derestricted or eighty-five
B	Germany you can just drive
C	um
B	tired pet?
A	mm
B	aw
A	really tired
C	so yeah er there is a bit
B	mm
C	um
A	I was gonna say
B	well
A	if you raise the speed limit so some people are driving at ninety
C	mm
A	feel comfortable doing seventy
C	well to be fair we possibly
C	oughtn't to be
B	but that is quite fast
C	well
B	whether it would just be exactly the same as currently
C	I don't think it I think it would make it slightly worse
C	well as it er as in practice isn't enforced
C	say that of course you shouldn't
B	mm
C	as contrary to the opinions of everyone spouting their
B	mm
C	like both directions
B	has anything happened yet? Or is there just talking about it?
C	oh they're gonna have a trial on the um
B	shall we have a drive down there one weekend? Go
C	um
B	what are they gonna
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	it's not um appropriate to have the same limit on both
B	when?
C	yesterday
B	oh right
C	Cos motorways have certain requirements to make them motorways
A	mm
B	they're as not as safe
C	so so dual carriageways have junctions across them
A	mhm
C	dual
A	mhm
C	um
B	what are you looking for?
A	sorry
B	can I have a look?
A	oh
A	mm
B	er don't I  don't I  cook a mean roast dinner?
A	it was really nice
A	I enjoyed that
B	I'm quite pleased with it
C	do you wanna help me with this bit?
B	do I wanna help you with that bit?
C	this chunk of meat
B	please
C	we'll have them in
A	what other sandwich fillings have you got?
B	other sandwich fillings are cheese tuna and ham
A	wow
B	variety in this house
A	it's free if I take sandwiches
A	mm
C	until we bill you for food at the end
C	of the week
B	I'll just eat sandwiches
C	sorry bill your parents for it at the end of this week
C	it's fine
B	mm
C	I'm sorry
B	I'm gonna leave that bit
B	it's gristle
A	in hall there was a point when like your piece of lamb would like look like that
B	that's not good
A	and like you'd have like this bit of meat and that bit of meat and
C	mm
B	Selwyn's never looked quite that bad
C	no it has
B	we did go
A	this was in my first year with chicken and banana
B	oh
C	Kat's
B	Kat's
A	oh no
B	it was really bad
C	it was embarrassing
A	for Selwyn formal?
C	well we are the twenty-third poorest out of thirty-one colleges
C	as the bursar's recent report said
B	you get
C	included the pay freeze pay rise freeze and bonus freeze for staff
B	that's quite bad
C	I was like yeah
B	I I I look forward
C	why the head porter's such a bitch
B	I look forward to my pay rise
A	why?
B	and I will be getting a mini bonus
A	why are they so poor?
B	because
C	because the college
B	er
C	well fundamentally until
A	mm
C	so all of our well firstly
A	oh okay
C	we're not that old in the sense of only a hundred and twenty-five years
A	yeah
C	secondly all of the old boys are priests
A	yeah
B	and so have no money
C	um
A	that's tricky
B	it's just how it works
C	and money generates money
A	yeah
C	rich colleges with endowments of a hundred million plus
A	mm
C	um
A	mm
B	but
C	but we do have
B	but er
C	some advantages
C	have your halls of residence
B	yeah
A	I didn't mind that though
B	so was it oh so it was bad er building
A	the location was actually much better
B	mm
A	in my second year
B	okay
A	than being er on
C	well that's a tad different because
B	it is a bit more
A	yeah
B	it's a bit bigger
A	yeah
B	than
C	well as in cos the
C	city of
B	you know like
C	you know the city of
B	is huge
C	but the
A	yeah
B	Cos it's
C	but the university is
B	and if you end up living in
C	well there's no er current uni accommodation up there
B	mm
C	but
C	no
B	mm
C	however um the beauty of Selwyn was that you were never more than at absolute most like two hundred yards away from a plodge
A	yeah
C	which was
C	has advantages as in you can get you can still go to hall all the time
A	yeah
B	but
A	like
B	mm
A	was um like twice the distance that
B	right
A	college
B	yeah
A	so it wasn't so much of a you didn't feel like you were out on a limb
B	yeah
A	um so
B	have you got porters now at um you live in
A	this is yeah this
B	do you have porters at
A	we have um
B	er do you have a man? Like a
A	a reception
B	yeah
A	but they're not there all the time
B	okay
A	but we have sub-wardens that are there all the time
B	yeah
A	that you can call
A	who you gonna call? Ghostbusters
B	who you gonna call? Sub-wardens
A	I did once get them out to tell the people upstairs they can shut the fuck up
A	at four o'clock in the morning
A	there's these
A	there's some
B	oh God
A	no no no no no
C	that's not a good way to start a sentence
A	there's some international students just arrived
B	right
A	for this semester
B	right
A	and they've taken the rooms of the people who were just here for a semester last semester
B	right
A	and they're noisy as anything
B	mm
A	and it's really really annoying
B	oh that's not what you want
A	by them playing music and stuff at like really inappropriate hours
B	that's
B	so generally
A	and we have like a main warden
B	you can ring
A	go to as well
C	mm
B	yeah cos the only people we share a wall is that little bit there
C	was it R and B?
B	I dunno what it was
A	that's really weird
B	but it yeah I mean you can imagine what it
A	who lives there? Do you know them?
B	well they're not being racist
A	not being rude
B	signal that you're gonna be rude
C	they've perfectly pleasant
B	the pile of rubbish?
C	as in they always smile
B	they do always smile
A	I haven't seen the pile of rubbish
B	they have unfortunately started fly-tipping on our
A	oh
B	visitor parking
C	they also
B	in the visitor parking space
A	yeah
B	and we thought well that's not really fine
C	yeah
B	I'm ringing the council tomorrow
C	get off our land
C	but er
B	I'm
A	why?
B	Cos our address isn't registered
A	why?
B	get a phone contract
A	that's ridiculous
A	is that for a land-line? Or?
C	no
B	no it's um just a mobile phone contract
A	oh okay
B	we've got one
C	we have one
A	oh
C	had one for months
B	well the problem is we don't actually have
C	since before we moved in in fact
A	oh
B	need to get a land-line in order to have the internet
C	and we have um free weekend calls
B	free weekend calls?
C	yes
B	but not to mobiles
C	yes
B	do we? I thought it was just to land-lines
C	mm
B	I think
C	I think
B	I think it's just land-lines
C	no I think it's
B	okay
C	think it's both
A	Will you give me your land-line number? Then I can ring you
B	mm
A	is cheaper
B	Cos I get free O2 to O2
A	oh no I'm on minutes actually
B	hundred minutes
A	which is not terribly much
A	I get unlimited texts and a hundred minutes
C	two fifty sterling?
B	that's
A	mm
