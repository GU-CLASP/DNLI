C	I've taken one piece
B	you're the one that actually just got rice
A	me?
B	yeah
C	I prefer normal rice it's just I don't think he's got rice to spare
A	what is easy cook rice? do they partially cook it?
C	mm
B	it's a different variety of rice
C	yeah
A	I don't get the point because rice is easy to cook anyway
B	oh no some people cannot cook rice
C	you get people who use a microwave rice in a bag
A	what that Uncle Ben's stuff?
A	but it's
C	like microwave what is it? egg fried rice?
B	you're going to have so much fun with
C	it looks and smells gross
D	egg fried rice in the microwave
B	you're not you're not
A	you can buy bags of rice they're like a pound each though for like a
B	you're not sharing your cooking then?
C	we are cos we're going to make sure he eats right
D	why does he not eat properly?
B	so what happens on the day when he has to cook?
C	we teach him to cook
B	is he teachable?
C	that remains to be seen
B	mm
C	he's quite stubborn
A	you have to I think you have to enjoy food to to want to cook though
C	yeah I don't think he well he does enjoy food but
A	but like you have to be discerning otherwise you think oh you know why don't I eat stuff that comes out the oven every day
C	he has either ridiculously hot like high salt diet
D	does he?
C	so much salt
B	more than
C	yeah
A	I don't eat that much salt I just season my food
C	yeah you think
A	I don't I just season my food
B	focaccia has usually got sea salt on top of it doesn't it?
C	when he's in Subway he always asks for salt and pepper on the subs and stuff
B	it's usually quite salty
A	mm
B	erm
A	I don't salt my sandwiches
C	erm and he goes he goes to like Wetherspoons and he gets like a mixed grill and he's just pouring it on so it gets to the point when you don't think I don't reckon he's got the taste this pretty much any more
B	it's quite high gluten though isn't it? mm it's very stretchy like ciabatta
D	mm
C	I mean it doesn't taste better I think he just likes the taste of salt
B	but if you all cook with less salt he'll have to get used to it
C	exactly so we're going to do
B	and he'll stop the craze
C	we're going to see if we can do no
B	yeah if you buy proper salt like sea salt
A	you have to use less and it tastes better
B	yeah you use that
A	but you still get it's still the taste the
C	mm but I guess with salt if you add to much though you just taste the salt don't you?
B	some foods have salty
A	it depends on your palette I think I don't know you don't salt meat it can be very bland
C	yeah
B	you shouldn't salt beef
A	what do you mean you should salt beef
B	before you cook it because all the water all the juices leech out of it
C	you salt and pepper don't you? oh I
A	apparently yeah like joints of beef and stuff like that
B	any beef I've been told
A	yeah but you salt yeah but any dish you salt
C	like er shoulder shoulder if you like salt a shoulder before you put it in the oven
B	that's different but if you're say frying pieces of beef or or stir fried beef or something you shouldn't salt it
C	I wouldn't salt a steak before frying it cos it makes it dries it out doesn't it?
B	yeah because it draws out all the water
A	I don't salt my steaks no
C	yeah that's fine you pepper it don't you?
B	oh yeah
C	I do need to go
B	while
A	I was going to have a little bit

B	we ate more than half of it
C	don't look at don't look at me I haven't had that much
B	it doesn't go that far you know
A	okay yeah obviously not
C	I had
B	we've got less that what we had last night
C	so I probably had about three scoops
B	it was between three so any particular flavour you fancy?
