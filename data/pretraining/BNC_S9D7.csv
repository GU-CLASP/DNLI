A	ah right okay
B	that makes quite a big difference in the morning
C	ten minutes in the car?
B	yes
A	there was a lot
B	yeah there was quite a lot
B	no
B	yes
A	used to be
B	ah right

A	yeah
B	so that is actually quite a big hassle
C	and you can do you do your car a bit before can't you?
B	that's what I was thinking do it even in November especially now that they've confirmed that I'm working at the near campus
B	so even if I end up
C	without it
B	having to get a taxi or something every day
C	yeah
B	it won't actually add up
C	no
B	to very much just only ten minutes and because it's winter I can probably walk home every day might not want to in the morning but
A	well if you can come
B	yes it would be nice
A	mm
B	yeah think so
B	oh okay this way yes
B	that's right
C	yeah
B	yes
C	yeah
B	ah yes
C	it did shut for about six

A	no
B	he doesn't like driving it
A	you've seen that little key? haven't you?
B	yes
B	oh right yes that's sensible
B	and then
A	yes
B	but anyway
B	yes
A	oh yes
B	do you know how to do that dad?

C	well yeah with her card
B	yes
C	yes
B	cos they're not linked are they? your card?
C	no
B	no so then mum could pick her offers
C	yeah
B	yes
A	what do I have to do?
C	erm
A	yes
C	then probably log
A	log in?
C	log in
C	and then it's called that business is called My Offers
A	called what?
C	My Offers
A	oh right okay
C	and
A	okay
B	aha
C	so
B	but if you wanted Waitrose whisky or some other one you probably would
C	it it might well do it might well do yes because erm
B	oh that's good
A	can you get ten of the same thing or not?
C	no because you only need to mark it once
B	cos it's every time you go mum
C	every time you go you get twenty P off twenty percent off that item
B	so if you're always buying lamb
A	yes
B	then every time you buy lamb
A	what for unlimited
C	erm I think until they change till they change them
B	yeah
C	which'll be I think they said the end of
A	okay
C	but but they don't do things like fresh meat
B	ah right
C	but like erm
B	yeah that's good
C	I got one today
B	oh that's quite a lot yeah so you want something where it's a couple of pounds normally or more don't you? because then you'll get a a bigger saving
C	oh yes
B	for something you buy quite regularly
C	yeah that big bag so it's
B	yeah
C	it's only
B	yes
C	and you get seventy P off

A	I don't
B	yeah
A	erm and then you know you've gotta go and ask
C	you have to go to the till
A	yes I
C	any till to get to
A	yes
C	I
B	take your own mug
C	well
B	and then go to the machine
C	actually
B	yeah
C	they've got like a bit
B	yeah
C	ones
B	ah right
C	er so that you do reuse it all the time
B	oh so you could do that
C	I think so yes
B	oh that's clever
A	seems all a bit
C	yeah
B	yeah if you're going to do a generous offer then there's not much point trying to claw it back is there?
C	no
B	it's one or the other just don't do it otherwise
C	I suppose though you're having
B	yeah
C	who didn't spend a penny
A	cos if they could work out a bit of a system
C	yeah yeah I agree
A	I'm sure they could
B	yes
C	yes
C	yeah because an easier way
B	outside

C	November
B	in the summer it's actually all sort of
C	children yes
B	but that's cos they know people are going away probably isn't it and summer holidays?
C	children
B	so there's no point bringing out anything serious
B	yes it's much better
A	and it's
A	so flat after Christmas I think is really popular
B	yeah
B	oh yes that's right it was

C	apparently there's a
B	it's all basically

B	quite a way there's a garage
A	yes half of it's the other side of the
B	ah right and the train station that's useful
