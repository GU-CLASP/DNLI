A	well oh god there's a chill every now and then I get this horrible like coldness up my back it's horrible
C	what here?
A	here
C	then what are you going to say?
A	it's like someone stepped on my grave
C	that it's that it's an apparition of some sort
A	well if there was one in the picture I took of you
C	there was a sort of glowing bit shape in one of the photographs now tell the children about when you saw a ghost when you were little
A	which one?
C	have you seen more than one?
A	mm
C	the monk at the end of the
A	oh
D	don't do that
C	don't do that
A	what?
C	oh
C	because we are in a house in the middle of nowhere so don't spook the children come on then
A	but you want me to tell them a about a ghost that I've seen
C	yes because ghosts are not they are so
A	but you don't want them to get scared
C	well it's not a scary ghost is it?
A	no it was just standing there
C	yeah
A	at the end of the drive
D	standing there
C	what's the other ghost you've seen?
A	mm
C	just standing just someone with a hood
A	well we used to have the family used to have a holiday home up in the Yorkshire Dales which is very remote and it was up the side of a massive mountain and there used to be an old monastery so a monastery where lots of monks stay and that was all derelict
B	what does derelict mean?
A	falling apart
C	a ruin
A	so erm
C	he was hiding crouching down I reckon
A	it was not hiding
A	that's a ghost because my then my grandma saw a ghost she woke up and she saw this figure at the foot of her bed she went
B	I know I know erm how ghosts can disappear so quickly
A	because they are a figment of our imagination
B	no because they are non-solid they can sink through anything even if there is something solid in their way they can sink into the ground and then once the car had passed they could go up
D	do you think
C	yes definitely
A	I've seen some pretty pretty good footage in the nineteen-seventies poltergeist footage really there's no
D	are poltergeist are poltergeists invisible?
A	mm
B	yeah they all around they could be all around us
B	for all we know
A	I'm going to check my Colgate toothpaste see if see if the ghost has used it
A	mm it was definitely medieval ghost because he would be like oh this toothpaste might my stumps are so shiny
C	I was going to say they don't they don't have any teeth anyway
A	no
B	the ghost might want to go and then all go
C	well you see if they had a a filling in their teeth and then it just hurt and then they had to take the teeth out
A	mm
C	so you know you are going to have your filling done in a couple of weeks' time
B	well I might but it might fall out by then
C	well I doubt it
A	a tooth is it a baby tooth?
C	it is a baby tooth yeah
A	crumbs
C	I know I know
A	a filling in a baby tooth
C	only a tiny hole but it is not bothering you at the moment I mean I think it is pointless however I guess if it started to hurt you then it's best to prevent it isn't it the filling
B	yeah but still it is going to hurt more than it is going to hurt me well it's going to hurt more with the filling than it is hurting me now
C	at the moment but if it gets bigger the thing is because you can't sort of clean it properly you can get infections in the holes and all sort of things so that's why that's why the do it but some of my teeth is mostly filling anyway
A	mm
C	if I had lots of money I would
A	oh so would I what like veneers?
C	no fisherman's cap they are called where you put a white or cream coating on them on the metal filling
A	oh
C	so it just looks like a tooth if you just bitten into your lolly stick
D	spit it out
C	take it out why is it still in your mouth it might have splinters
D	idiots
C	why why did you bite it?
C	you'd like veneers well I'd like I'd like my teeth whitened as well
B	mum
D	look you are going to get a splinter on your tongue
B	I've got your problem solved
C	just have massive prawn crackers instead of teeth that would look nice
A	prawn crackety and everything you bite into would go
C	that would be nice
B	I know you are
C	perhaps I'll Tippex my teeth
D	what does Tippex mean?
C	Tippex is a white liquid that you put on documents if you've made a mistake
A	but you not allowed it at school any more are you?
C	are you not?
A	no
C	probably not well people in the office have it so if I've made a mistake on a document okay and it was only a tiny error and I wanted to photocopy it then rather than print out the whole document I would use the Tippex to Tippex it out and then that error would be gone so when it got photocopied you wouldn't be able to see that mistake it does smell though so lots of silly people at school used to sort of sniff it and get all excited about it and mess it up you know pour it over their text books and stuff
B	why?
C	because teenagers are silly sometimes
D	if they did pour all over their text books then the teachers would go why did you put it on your text book
C	well it kind of obviously it dries
A	that's why it got banned
C	I would imagine right you can eat that chicken ball if you like
A	okay can I have another milky Mini Milk?
C	after that if you've got room yes you two have been eating like there's no tomorrow what are you doing
B	there's no tomorrow
C	can you sit down please

A	no as in like we we woke up and it was still dark
C	it was today again mm
A	and all the clocks were just stop all watches were stopped everything was absolutely stopped and it was just stuck in time
C	why does it have to be dark?
A	because there was no tomorrow so you would get to midnight and it stop
C	why can't it stop at like noon or something
A	there's a little monkey climbing on me
C	there is
C	could you climb back onto your own chair monkey girl
B	oh wait there's a banana on that chair monkey come and get it
C	why have you both been talking about bananas and cheese all weekend?
