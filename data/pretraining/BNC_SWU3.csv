A	did I tell you that I might go to Zumba tomorrow? So if you want a lift
B	zumba
A	to
B	okay
A	bank
B	yeah
A	then you need the nine o'clock we leave
B	yeah
A	mum was thinking of dropping me off at Zumba and then going
B	yeah
A	can you pay my cheque in?
B	and get some money out for the rent
A	can you pay my cheque in?
B	yeah
A	thanks
B	pay your cheque in
A	I can't think
B	what? How early's early?
A	well I well not too early
B	okay
A	but I'm not too sure if I'm gonna go to Zumba or come to town with you
B	right
A	but either way we're going to town at nine
B	okay
A	dance
B	well I never had any
A	no
B	yeah
A	it's just that really
B	well why is it different to?
A	she does almost like an Arabic alalalalala
A	thing
A	every so often
B	so why is it different to like normal aerobics?
A	it's not really
B	so it's just a new fashion is it?
A	yeah
B	mhm
A	and then er we've had some we've even done like um the Irish dancing in one of them
A	like just moving your legs
B	but how old are the
A	just like a few steps of like each
B	how old are the people in it?
A	they're a mixture
B	oh
A	we got a bloke turn up last week
B	oh
A	they're a mixture
B	mm
A	yeah
B	hm
A	you don't
B	for an hour
A	yeah
B	that's alright innit?
A	yeah I think it's alright
B	yeah
A	mm
B	huh
A	apparently that hall is quite cheap to
B	is it?
A	to rent out
B	yeah er cos
A	yeah
B	how much? Can you remember?
A	well it was stupid
B	about forty pounds an hour or something
A	yeah I know
A	how's she supposed to make any money?
B	yeah
A	she'd have to have and there's not even enough room in there to have a class
B	it's a tiny little room
A	ridiculous
B	she didn't even have a board or anything
A	no
B	how can they ask forty quid?
A	I don't know
B	they should be
A	they're gonna close down other libraries though
B	yeah
A	they just have to make as much money mm as they can
B	yeah
A	just ridiculous because if people can't rent out the room to um I don't know to do something with then
B	yeah
A	but it's like Welbourne Hall basically do you know how cheap that is?
B	no
A	I didn't realize how cheap that was
B	how much is that then?
A	I've forgotten now
B	yeah
A	it was ridiculously cheap
B	yeah
A	it was like I don't know twenty pounds for the whole day and night or something
B	wow
A	like you can
B	twenty pounds?
A	well that's what they said when dad had his party
B	yeah
A	I reckon they just did
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	they wouldn't do it for that cheap for me
B	well you're family aren't you
A	mm
B	yeah my dad was saying that as well
A	yeah if you're resident or
B	well
A	your hall is cheap
B	no dad was saying that um if you hire out just a normal hall if you get the bar as well then obviously cos you'll be spending an absolute fortune at the bar a lot of the places give you the hall for free
A	yeah
A	so that's why it would have been quite good I suppose to do that for our wedding but
B	yeah well I'm glad we didn't really
A	no I don't want that atmosphere
B	anyway
A	it's
B	you know stuck in a hall
A	yeah
B	it's not really what I want
A	no
B	hm
A	mm
B	do you think your mum will be alright driving there tomorrow?
A	I don't think she should go out at all really
B	she's still sounding a bit rough
A	I think she should stay
B	whose go is it?
A	in the warm
B	mine
A	I think she should stay in the warm
B	mm
A	cough is I mean that's bronchitis she's got
B	mm
A	but she won't admit it
B	no
A	mm
B	yeah I mean she's
A	look at the weather now
B	she's been jumping around today
A	mm
B	off her face on those pills
A	she doesn't look like she's off her face though
B	no but like yesterday she was she couldn't move
A	no
B	I think
A	yeah
B	hm
A	it goes really fast when you've got two people doing this game
B	yeah it does doesn't it
A	they can't be bothered
B	hm
B	what else is there? Trivial Pursuit I suppose
A	ludo
B	yeah
A	it's just luck of the dice
B	it's crap isn't it?
A	yeah
B	risk was was a good one
A	you're very picky on picking your pieces
B	huh?
A	you have to dig right to the bottom
B	you have to
A	of the pile
B	follow the force don't you
A	mm
B	but remember we played Risk a couple of years ago and it's just
A	oh I didn't like that
B	rolling the dice isn't it?
A	I think it's yeah
B	I used to like it cos it had a map of the world and you could I like moving about in different countries and stuff like that
A	mm
B	that's what attracted me I think
A	mm
B	I think
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	I dunno
B	um
A	cor listen to that
B	mm
A	that wind
B	yep
A	ah I'm gonna phone them maybe
B	yeah
A	like phone them up and say
B	you should
A	yeah
B	um
A	yeah
B	Cos it's been three weeks now hasn't it?
A	yeah
B	and they said three weeks
A	I don't really know
B	yeah
A	and just see
B	mm
A	there's nothing more that we can do
B	I mean it's annoying cos we had
A	right
B	we have had like three jobs by now
A	I know
B	we turned them all down for this one
A	I really want to go
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	I jump on and off that road for three
A	I dunno
B	yeah it's getting a bit worrying isn't it?
A	yeah
B	eight
A	I just want to experience the different culture again
B	mm
A	it's just I mean I like it here but it's just so sleepy at times
B	yeah
A	it just feels quite sleepy
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	well it's a long time for us isn't it?
A	I like it though this time
B	what is it you like the most?
A	I don't know
B	community?
A	I don't know
B	what community?
A	well no just people speaking English
B	I don't know if I like that
A	I do
B	you have to listen to loads of inane conversations about Eastenders and
A	no
B	people talking bollocks
A	Cos when we were walking the the dogs and stuff everybody was stopping and saying oh hello
A	kind of nice
B	mm
A	I don't know
B	yeah
A	I do  I do  think some of it is
B	I mean when we
A	is nice
B	when we first got back I really liked having all the er the ales and the cheeses
A	yeah
B	and stuff like that
A	yeah when everybody just wants to get drunk all the time
B	yeah
A	oh
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	I don't mind the drinking but it's the huh it's the excess
A	yeah
B	no
A	well you can though with some people
B	you can
A	the people we've been hanging out with
B	well yeah
A	you can't stop
B	that I you know thirty-four and I still don't know when to stop drinking
A	yeah
B	and that's like
A	you need to figure it out
B	but I like
A	I'm getting better
B	yeah
A	I can feel myself getting better cos I I stop and say no I I'll I'll just have a lime and soda this round
B	yeah yeah
A	no
B	it's it's I don't know what it is
A	no it's not
B	yeah
A	part of the whole thing
B	mhm
A	and then  and then you have all that fruit
B	yeah
A	even though it was popcorn or something rubbish like that
B	well they did like drinking though
A	yeah but they had the popcorn to kind of try and soak it up a bit
B	mm
A	it was a bit huh
B	well yeah and you and eating out was such a big part of the culture
A	yeah
B	that you wouldn't just go out
A	I'll jump upon that one
B	for a drink really would you
A	yeah
B	whereas here it's just
A	well people can't I don't know
B	it's all about getting drunk
A	I think it's
B	really bad
A	changing
B	mm
A	but hm I dunno
B	mm
A	there's a long way to go yet
B	well you know but that's why these all these ales have appeared in the supermarkets now
A	yeah I know
B	haven't they?
A	well that means that's all the pubs that are gonna close
B	well that's why they've all turned into restaurants
A	but I love that part of our culture
B	yeah
A	and you feel
B	mm
A	for a pint during the day
B	uh-huh
A	and women can drink a whole a big pint
B	yep
A	but um I don't but the rest of the culture has just gone crazy
B	yeah
A	what?
B	er twenty-seven plus eighteen
A	I thought I was miles ahead of you
B	so like thirty-seven
A	you haven't even made any castles
B	forty-five
A	you haven't even made any castles
B	well I got all those
A	two
B	cathedrals didn't I
A	I just did it
B	er hm
A	mm
B	hm
A	well
B	what are you gonna miss?
A	nothing
B	because this is
A	I want to get out and go and see some more stuff now
B	yeah
A	it is
B	no but I'm feeling a little bit like that this time as well
A	yeah
B	it's it's holding me back
A	and
B	more than last time
A	having the garden and just being able to grow some veg and stuff
B	yeah but it's not your garden is it
A	no
B	it's only cos we're staying here
A	no but when when we live abroad we never
B	mm
A	have anything like that
B	well we wouldn't here if we got a job somewhere would we
A	but you've got the potential to one day buy some land
B	mm
A	so you can  you can  do it
B	yeah
A	there's definitely the potential to do it
B	well that's the  um goal isn't it though?
A	yeah
B	hm
A	why are you getting three?
B	for that road
A	oh
B	hm
A	over there
B	yeah
A	sixteen
B	no I feel bad for that as well
A	I know
B	to make them feel better you know
A	well they always
B	about themselves and about their country
A	but they always say oh but you've got the free healthcare and stuff
B	well that's true
A	well you know it's got its flaws
B	the quality sucks
A	but lots of countries they don't have that
B	well yeah
A	yeah
B	and his mate was working with him just to try and pay off his like hospital debts
A	yeah
B	I mean that's that's so sad
A	yeah
B	hm
A	mm

A	and I'll go on there
B	I don't know
A	yeah

A	well have this one for four
B	yeah
