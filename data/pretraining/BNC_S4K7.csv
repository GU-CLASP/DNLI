A	okay so
B	yeah
A	all done that's fine but I've done a to do list so I wanna if we can just go through
A	just
B	you just minimised it
A	I did I didn't mean to
A	ah yeah okay hold on
B	yep
A	right? so I've ordered serviettes for wrapping the cake afterwards when it's chopped up
B	okay
A	and they're coming tomorrow
B	yep
A	table bling I've got
B	eighties confetti
A	eighties confetti yeah
B	disco
A	like disco Day-Glo stuff
B	mm
A	no no no
A	and
B	yeah
A	with the eighty on as well
B	yeah
A	and I've asked the
B	yeah
A	we can bring it up and they'll put it on so it'll all be ready and I said er there's like confetti as well? yes yes absolutely fine
B	but don't you wanna put
A	yes
B	yeah
A	table bling's received erm right so the table plan and cards we're gonna do the cards in a minute
B	mm hm
A	and then the table plan I think what I what I'm gonna do cos
B	yeah
A	and
B	yeah
A	yeah and then she wants to make sure that
B	yeah
A	are together so I think what I'll just do is I'll send with the menu choice I think I'll just send a thing saying please can these people be grouped together? these ones these ones these ones and then they'll set them
B	yeah well if you just send like a a
A	so they don't know exactly what
B	no
A	because for fifteen they might put us up in that room up a couple of steps did you go?
B	yes I've been up there
A	yeah cos sometimes they do a table round a corner like that or something
B	could
A	yeah
B	it'll go round if they do it circle it'll go round
A	yeah that's a really good idea
B	well we'll get there earlier anyway so we
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	and
A	well I don't know
A	I'll actually I'll I'll need to find that out
B	you find out yes
A	okay
B	so speak to your son
A	speak to son
B	yeah
A	and
B	mm hm
A	yeah so that's fine er that that is all isn't it? there's nobody else we're coming with us here?
B	mm
A	that's right cos
B	yeah
B	uhu
A	so hopefully she'll be okay but
B	mm
A	hoping she'll be alright for Saturday
B	mm yeah
A	you know but anyway we'll we'll see
B	yeah
A	and they just blow them up for free
B	yeah
A	and er they said oh no
B	that's good
A	blown up
B	yep
A	and then take them like that so
B	mm
A	I will do tomorrow
B	mm
A	the email address there
B	yeah
A	oh
B	yeah
A	erm but he basically said he was leaving the next day
B	yeah
A	so
B	yeah
A	what she was doing she seemed quite er organising others as well but anyway so er it's
B	yeah
A	so the cake I've ordered the cake
B	yeah
A	doing it and she said yeah I'm gonna go and see it Friday morning at about ten o'clock
B	uhu
A	and pay for it
B	yep
A	because I thought if I try and bring it home and then
B	yeah
A	and but
B	that's good
B	the other thing you could do about the table plan is ring them and ask them how they would
A	we could do actually couldn't we
B	and just do that ourselves
A	take take them
B	yeah
A	yeah we could we could take them
B	I think that would probably be easier
A	cos er that'd
B	because if they end up doing a horseshoe or whatever cos if you're thinking about putting people together cos I was just thinking through with our little like group I was thinking like
A	yeah
B	us and but I was thinking well if you put say for example you put
A	mm
B	people he doesn't know
A	yeah
B	he's not gonna talk to anyone
A	yeah
B	wanna have it like a four
B	like
A	yeah
B	whatever like that so then you can talk and and
A	yeah
B	rather than being cos then people can sit near
A	yeah
B	rather than
A	we'll do that
B	it being along in a line
A	mm
B	yeah
A	and then
B	ah
A	so when we're doing the cards the
B	yeah
A	er just put like A A
B	or in the
A	or B B
B	in the middle of it where you open it up
A	yeah
A	I'm gonna put all the names
B	yeah
A	but yeah if you just put A and A or B
B	yeah
A	and B
B	yeah
A	and then and we
B	yeah
A	when we're doing it we can just look right that makes sense
A	because it
A	oh separately
A	maybe
B	yeah that'd be separately
A	I'm gonna put by
A	written September
A	when the birthday was actually
B	that's like can you make can you make that? that so that it fits it? because that's gonna really bug me
A	can I make
B	double click at the end so that it fits the
B	do something because it's like OCD nightmare mother
A	how's that?
A	is that better?
B	yeah it's a bit like OCD nightmare and
A	oh dear
A	I've got that
A	balloons with eighty I
A	erm
B	you're gonna struggle
A	I'm gonna struggle
B	I'm fine
A	got those
A	yeah which we'll do and we'll take and then we can just get them put round
B	yeah cake's being delivered there menu choices you're gonna send
A	yep
B	er we've got gotta book the taxi and check with
A	yeah
B	that's pretty much it isn't it? because they do the rest of it er they do the cooking
A	they are
B	erm
B	mm hm
A	so I need to take
B	oh
A	mm erm
B	yeah
A	that's not how you spell serviettes iette serviettes erm
B	table
A	yeah er well I'm gonna take it at some point on the Saturday I think we're decorating Saturday
A	what time they open let me have a look and see what time they open
B	I'm skating first thing
A	yeah?
B	yeah
A	so
B	I'm skating first thing yeah
A	okay and then erm
B	but I'll be back back at about half tenish
A	okay
B	okay
A	so er I'm gonna have to go probably in the afternoon at some point
B	okay
A	cos if you go at lunchtime it will be busier and I think I if er so I'll probably go mind you I wonder if they're open right through? let me look
A	yeah yeah they're open from
B	mm
A	midday through to eleven at night so I if I actually go mid-afternoon
B	yeah
A	it should be less busy then
A	and I and I'll be able to take it and
B	well I can come with you
A	yeah that'll be nice
B	place settings
A	but erm aren't we gonna take them when we go?
B	yeah but we gotta take them at some point
A	well er if I if I yeah cos if I put them in the bags some er kind person'll put them all out so er it's either that we either have to take them
B	yeah
A	with us
B	er
A	I think your idea of just saying
B	yeah but you don't want them to do say for example they do a square table
A	yeah
B	like this
A	mm
B	you don't want them to do like
A	yes that's true cos you want people
B	that's what I mean
A	sitting opposite you
B	you'd you'd rather
A	yeah yeah
B	have it
A	yeah that's fine so that's erm
A	that's something that we need to take
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	people sat and they won't have anyone to talk to
A	yeah no that's fine
B	mm hm
A	yeah so I'll actually get them on the Saturday
B	like we did with
A	mm
B	with the balloons in the car

B	hm?
A	that's true so I don't need that then do I?
B	apart from
A	haven't I got that somewhere?
B	no
A	okay
B	that's why I said it
A	uhu
B	mm hm

B	ta-da magic
B	and I'll remember on the day it's fine even if you
B	evening
A	evening
B	mm

B	no because they're doing the hard bit like I said
A	yeah they're doing the cooking
A	mm
B	okay mm
A	er I'm gonna need this I'm gonna print out this
B	well I was just gonna say
A	menu choice thing

A	print cancelled right
A	right file
A	one of one yay so now print's cancel yah
A	I know I'm getting good
B	well
A	right huh do some lines around it so it's easier to read
A	and then print
B	I never make errors
A	or want to improve
A	okay let's go oh let's go in there then wow
B	what are you doing?
A	what am I doing? oh
A	so I'm gonna have a practice how do you think you're going to do it?
B	I'm gonna do boys' names in blue and girls' names in pink

A	ah
B	no boring
A	and I was like print them?
B	I don't like the Hs when I do Hs like that
A	like what?
B	like I just did
A	oh
A	cos they're different sizes but actually it did
B	they're meant to be
A	cos it just does that yeah
A	mm
B	I don't like it
A	no
B	I'm just trying to decide how to do it to make it nice
A	what about bubble writing? or?
B	what about like that? if you do the first letter big
A	oh yeah that's good that's nice
B	huh huh huh huh
A	huh huh huh huh
B	so this is one that you don't you don't have to tell me I just have to have an inspirational moment
A	I was leaving you to have your inspirational moment
B	er
A	right I'm just writing
B	okay
A	okay
B	and you're doing that upside down
A	sorry?
B	you're writing it upside down
A	cos I thought then people will go
A	like that
B	I will allow you
A	is that right?
B	I'll allow it
A	it is right isn't it?
B	I know
A	okay would you like to start again?
B	please
A	vintage hunter's
B	yes please I'll do
A	okay yeah then I'll write inside so we can just take it in turns
B	we've got plenty so you know I can make a couple of mistakes
A	I thought you didn't make
B	I don't
B	it's just the writing straight thing that I struggle with
B	that's better
A	right so
B	little bit wonky but I I'm really bad at writing straight
A	oh
B	I've always written on the wonk
A	yeah oh that's nice
A	that's
B	remind me when I'm doing the
A	yes
B	celebrity
A	celebrity on the internet
B	on the internet
A	why ever's that?
B	because she's obviously clearly psychopathic I dunno
B	that's one done oh did I give you the new
A	yes
B	you've done it? okay
A	new
B	I dunno who the next person is
A	well whoever you want er whoever's going if you see what I mean
B	okay
A	so if you just choose somebody off there
B	if I do
A	yeah
A	and
B	erm
A	mm hm
B	and I said to
A	yeah
B	and then had to wait for her mum to come and pick her up so
A	yeah
B	and she went oh yeah yeah and so then I just messaged her and said I don't know if you know but it's cancelled and she went oh yeah I forgot I was even planning on coming
A	well that's better than her getting there and
B	yeah
A	sitting there and thinking
B	chorizo
A	burger
B	I am ending up with them at one side but I think if I keep them all to one side actually that'll look okay won't it?
A	yeah
B	because it's it's hard when you do the
A	yeah
B	big letter to
A	no that's fine
B	to kind of
B	yeah I haven't had it because I thought I didn't really

A	fish
B	yeah
A	that's fine it's alright I was just starting to do

A	yeah
B	or that like the chicken you know they
A	yes
B	like nice staple dish don't they? sort of thing
A	yes I think I had it there once and I actually didn't really enjoy it
B	I don't know
A	peanut butter
B	that's
A	thank you
A	peanut butter and chocolate
B	er that sounds amazing if it wasn't a cheesecake if it wasn't a cheesecake I would've totally had that
A	no I know
B	mm
A	the same letter as
A	fish sharing platter
B	absolutely
A	because I'm gonna have cauliflower cheese as well with the fish pie so it's not all fish

A	fish pie
A	cauliflower
B	so B is
A	and he said erm
A	rhubarb

A	huh
B	he doesn't have dessert but then he gets he
A	mm
B	mm mm mm
A	it was because it was spiced?
B	yeah
A	maybe?
B	I think it might've been so that's why I went for the brie
A	yeah so rib-eye steak and she would like mashed potato
B	that is
A	mm hm
B	have I done Bs?
A	mm and raspberry crème brûlée I thought you were gonna have did you have that when we went there?

A	but they've taken it off the menu
A	oh
B	nice like that
A	crème brûlée

A	food and people
A	right
A	but actually it's just the top is the
B	yeah
A	and underneath it is all is all your pie filling so it's not this huge great pie actually when you
B	mm
A	really nice
B	I'm just gonna get the
B	you see how did I decide I was doing the C? cos I decided it's for mine there we go little bit of a bump at the bottom
A	bit of a bump?
B	yeah well with me and my brother having the same initials you know it kind of
A	mm hm that was deliberate
B	was it?
A	yeah
A	so
B	ah I wasn't sure if it was deliberate
A	oh yes
B	so then it's just me and thee and
B	and I'm doing a couple of little stars on
A	oh yeah definitely she needs a bit of bling
B	I need to decide how I'm doing a K I haven't done a K yet
A	aren't you aren't you gonna put mum?
B	no
B	cos that applies to more than one person there
A	er
B	oh that's a bit swirly I like that
A	that's nice
B	swirly
A	yeah I like that
A	when we've done it all what we'll do is

A	yeah
B	it's well it's just cheese really so you know
A	yeah
B	whatchamaflip
B	uh
A	mm

B	mm hm
A	baked
B	I'm just gonna starve myself all day
A	baked Cornish brie
B	mm
A	that's something else I need to add on my list to be telling people so they want wine on the table and
B	you hope
A	yeah
B	was it
A	did you change it? or just?
B	no because they didn't have er
A	oh you had the sirloin didn't you and then you changed it

A	no starter
B	birthday girl
A	ah
B	this is my fast dancing
A	over so you can draw balloons on them
B	don't drop them in the candle
A	that would be a bit sad
B	that would be very sad
B	oh they'd probably be
B	I'd rather you didn't
A	right no starter
A	ultimate
B	well you could thing is as well with your cookies and cream you can always just order a Baileys with your dessert then you've basically got it in
A	oh yeah and just pour it on top of it
B	see full of ideas me
A	mm
B	yeah you can't have very often have three course meals so I just thought do you know what?
A	oh I used to always but now I
B	yeah
A	right
B	I like the balloons actually they do look cute don't they?
A	yeah it does it just really sets it off doesn't it?
A	yeah
B	and like yeah let's go for it
A	yeah but you're so artistic you just
B	yeah
A	the little gap that's just such a clever thing
B	I always do
A	yeah
B	my brother
A	he's just er he's not having a starter
B	is he not?
A	no I said
A	oh I said don't you want a starter? he says no point being greedy I'm gonna have a nice big steak and a pudding
B	oh I've seen him with all his
A	stuff and
B	shakes and stuff and
A	yeah and shakes and stuff and
B	tablets and
A	yeah
B	so that'll last for about two months
A	oh yeah he goes in circles doesn't he
B	yep and then he'll stop again and go back to takeaways every night
A	although he to be fair he has said er because he wants to take the rugby more seriously he's and he's been taking it more seriously the last couple of seasons but he really wants to get
B	mm
A	cos they almost did last time
B	mm
A	and this
B	yeah
A	so he was saying this cos we're starting from go now and doing well
B	yeah
A	and then he said if they don't go up he'll seriously consider going somewhere else into a higher level team
B	yeah
A	so he can play at that level not that he wants to leave
B	I love this song
A	is it?
B	yeah
A	oh
B	yeah
A	garlic mushrooms
B	well isn't that? uh
A	what
B	well I was gonna say that's what
A	yeah
B	as you do
A	being an old man
B	being an old man
B	not really
A	and guess what he's having?
B	mm I wonder was it anything you were gonna go and steal from him?
A	oh yes that ultimate chocolate brownie tower
B	how many people are having that?
A	er one two three four five six
B	mm
A	six out of fifteen
B	yeah
A	so almost half
A	then there's
B	sherries?
B	I don't like sherry in er but I like it in a trifle
A	well it's really sweet though isn't it? yeah
B	I was making them higher I thought I was I started making them lower down
A	oh
B	because I'd started doing them lower
A	oh
B	mm
A	ultimate chocolate
B	so did you send the menu out to everyone again
B	once it'd changed? to see if anyone had
A	I did because
B	changed their mind
A	there are such a lot of changes on it even though I started looking and thinking well theirs is okay they've gotta change that and I thought actually I'm not er I'm not gonna do that I'm not er one it's my time but two
B	yeah
A	see something and think oh actually I would've had that you know
B	yeah
A	and if somebody had swapped so I just thought right I sent back the list that everyone had done
B	mm
A	with their choices plus the new menu with a note in it just saying sorry they've just changed the menu can you just look at what you're having and see if there's anything you want to change? erm and let me have it back by tomorrow
B	yeah
A	which you know they all did so
B	I just sat and did it when you were at the computer so
A	yeah
A	and then he's having
B	well whenever
A	yeah either that or fish and chips
B	yeah
A	sticky toffee and
A	yeah
B	that's that I said not that
A	that done
A	in a minute we'll just cross-reference with one of us doing read out the things and one check it off the paper
B	I was just grinning at you
A	oh grinning I thought
B	yeah it is
A	it's Jesse
A	you're ballooning
B	that sounds bad
A	yeah er do
B	yeah please perhaps three
A	I didn't when I was there cos I knew you were gonna be cleaning them out and I thought well it it you know that's why I didn't and I didn't know for sure if you wanted me to get you some and because we'd gone out to be there for ten o'clock I thought if you were sleeping in I didn't want to disturb you so that's why I didn't
B	yeah three
A	but
B	yeah please
A	yeah okay and any particular anything? or just what what I think's nice
B	just pretty ones
A	okay
B	cos as well the plants the way I've got them now are hopefully better for them breeding
A	mm
B	cos they've actually got more places for the baby's to hide and not get eaten by my er
A	yeah
B	mm
A	and then I can bring them and put them in for you
B	thank you
