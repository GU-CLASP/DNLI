B	I'll sleep through it
A	yeah
B	I will do eventually
A	mm
B	on Facebook?
A	yeah
B	and what's that one then dear?
A	well it's more
B	are you allowed to mention
A	it's it's dealing more with issues that I've been talking about
B	well we'll see dear
A	you know they're calling it the way they're spinning it
B	yeah cos a fraction of that just to improve the current building wouldn't it?
A	exactly
B	and then spent millions to rebrand to
A	mm
B	and a shitload on their propaganda paper
B	that's true
A	like to moan about
B	post a comment like it's another sign of gentrification
A	yes exactly
B	and they'll pull down the back of the building
A	yeah
B	did you want to pop into the shop on the way home?
A	hadn't intended to
B	okay
A	what did you want? I mean we will need to again
B	let's do it tomorrow but we really need
A	I did but I forgot about it
B	well I thought you got paid
A	no I'm hoping Monday I get paid
B	I know
A	oh I see
B	erm
A	oh that's alright
B	which is below the department average
A	you should tell your mum she'll be very proud
B	yes she will
A	yeah you had to do a sort of pro rata?
B	yeah but when I have my six months so like in summer your sort of six month review they'll then it'll be accurate figures cos I would have been there for a year so that will be more telling one way or the other
A	mm
B	I'm enjoying it dear
A	mm
B	ginger will be good for me
A	actually I had the
B	the pasta
A	macaroni cheese yeah
B	a caramel have you eaten them all?
A	no
B	did you eat all the Cheddars?
A	I ate one packet of Cheddars
B	eventually
A	oh that's good
B	five o'clock
A	uhu
B	yeah it's good it's much better than the other iterations of of their king prawn dishes
A	yeah
B	was it?
A	yeah
B	that's a good sign
A	mm I don't know if there's a party going on in there or something
B	haven't been there for a while
A	no
B	why didn't you want to meet there?
A	cos I thought it would be a bit noisy
B	that was perspicacious of you
A	that was what?
B	er perspicacious
A	what does that mean?
B	foresight good foresight
A	how come you remember all these long words?
B	just come across them a lot
A	what in crosswords?
B	I think so
A	but then how does your brain retain them?
B	I get used to them dear
A	my brain's like a sieve
B	well so is mine
A	no it's not cos you can draw on words when you need them I have to find them
B	uhu
A	but I was noticing when I did brain training and the memory games I can only do them if I use words so if it's remembering an order as in symbols or shapes I have to say the name of each and then I can remember them I can remember a sequence of names but I can't remember it just by looking
B	it's a mnemonic
A	it is a form of a mnemonic well it is a mnemonic but it's and so I can only remember things with mnemonics or in mnemonic form and yet I mean for example if you're tracing erm you have to follow the route of the robot and remember it but if I count the number of squares it's gone down you could do it almost mathematically and then you'd remember but just visually
B	but people have different
A	it's really hard to do different
B	skills and ways
A	skills and ways of remembering but
B	like Proust and smell of his Madeleine cakes
A	what does that mean?
B	it's the smell that or that he remembers
A	but that's more of an emotional memory
B	darling why don't you have that last prawn or the last bit of erm?
A	I'm going to have the last prawn and then I'm full
B	shall I have that bit of?
A	yeah
B	it's actually a double bit
A	but I think when you get past a point in music and reading music
B	you just read it
A	yeah you go every good boy deserves fruit that's how you're taught to remember it E B E G B D
B	yeah
A	F
A	as soon as you start doing things by feel it makes a lot more sense like touch typing
A	I think I might start up my piano lessons again
B	you said dear
A	not on tape
B	oh sorry
B	well done
A	sorry?
B	do you want a bottle of fruity red wine?
B	I'm sleepy
A	you're full or you've got a cold?
B	full sleepy got a cold
A	oh right no I'm not going to have a bottle of wine tonight thank you
B	shall we?
A	oh no we'll wait a little bit
B	I ate the er squid from out of it
A	there's still a bit of squid in it I should think oh no maybe not
B	well there might be a little bit
A	I need the loo
A	alright?
B	right shall I go and settle the bill dear?
A	yes okay
