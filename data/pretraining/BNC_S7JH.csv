B	I know yeah
A	I must do that some time with you that er family tree
B	yeah don't worry about it
C	it would be
B	just a passing interest
C	I I've always fancied doing something like that
A	well I got mum to do the family tree before she passed away
C	can imagine delving back cos you see them on the telly the programmes
A	yeah
C	have you seen them?
A	I know I love it
C	it was really really good
A	really?
B	yeah that's a bit crazy that
A	wow
C	that's interesting innit?
A	yeah
C	I love history
A	yeah
B	I don't reckon we've got any er pertinent characters in our family
C	oh you don't know
A	oh I don't know because dad erm wasn't it Spanish and Irish?
C	his his erm
A	descendants wasn't it?
C	no erm nan's dad was half Welsh er dad's
B	oh god we've go Welsh in us have we?
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	you've married into the Welsh
A	yeah
C	oh
B	bloody
C	er and erm
B	they're they're everywhere
C	dad's erm grandmother so that would be your great great grandmother erm I think was half Spanish
B	mm
A	no it would only be his great grandmother wouldn't it?
C	his great great no it was dad's grandmother so it would be our great so it would be his great great
A	oh right great great great yeah
C	go down the generations
A	okay
C	yeah two greats yeah
A	yeah okay
B	great to the power of two
A	yeah that's it
C	but I mean grandad er grandad
A	yeah yeah
C	well-suited and everything and booted
A	all the children had clothes on and holidays
C	clothes on
C	they had decent
A	no but they they were dressed decent weren't they?
C	they had good clothes and holidays and back in them days down
A	that's a lot
C	erm it was considered you were considered comfortably or you know
A	and a car
C	yeah all that back then
B	mm clothes and a car
C	clothes and car yeah
B	well-to-do that side of the family
C	but you're going back to the early erm what? twentieth century
B	so what did the other half have? a mule and
A	no but what I mean is they had the tweed proper coats
B	and nappies
A	and the the
C	yeah
A	heavy good shoes and the well well-dressed
C	I think nan's I think nan's side of the family nan
A	I mean they
C	beneath him
A	yeah but they had
B	oh dear
A	eight children and they still had holidays every year and they had a car and er each child in the photograph had
C	yeah er
B	mm
C	auntie
A	mm mm
B	fair
C	I don't know what he did though
A	it's interesting isn't it? we haven't seen
C	but I'd love to go further back like you say
A	yeah
B	yeah it's the other side
C	Oliver Cromwell?
B	I
C	what about dad's side? your dad's
B	oh I don't think you can trace it very far he'd need to pay I think to do it
C	or go online and do it
A	I think you do anyway don't you?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	well I guess if you know and your family know isn't it? you can trace people
C	well
B	it's Jewish originally
C	is it?
A	is it?
B	yeah
B	erm I believe and then it was Irish
C	cos he doesn't know much about his mum does he?
B	no I was gonna say
C	your nan on his side
A	well he knows his mum he knew his mum
C	no I
A	yeah but he was he was a child he remembers his mum
B	well I don't think he knows much about her family or
C	no but I he doesn't know yeah but he doesn't know much about erm we're talking about the history
A	oh the family the tree?
C	yeah his
A	yeah yeah
C	so his nan
A	yeah
C	which would be your great nan
A	interesting mm
B	random question
B	I
A	she's hard to understand isn't she?
B	but she may be speaking a form of creole
C	I don't know I mean it was
B	there's all sorts of creoles there's like Jamaican creole
C	the Jamaican version was called patois wasn't it?
B	yeah it's it's a patois which is a type of language
C	mm
B	but it was it Jamaican she spoke?
C	no she didn't speak patois she hers was just what they call broken English
B	but broken English is a is a negative term
C	it was
B	for a pidgin or a creole
C	yeah
B	the type of language is a
C	so is pidgin or creole the same as erm what your
B	yeah it's the same
C	as broken English?
B	so a pidgin is a contact language erm developed through trade that nobody speaks as a first language they use it as a second language
C	yeah
B	but when it becomes a first language it becomes a creole
C	oh I see so it's pidgin then creole
B	so when the children start using it as a first language they need to fill in the grammar because it doesn't have enough grammar basically
C	no
B	to be used in every environment and then it becomes a creole language
C	because it was
B	and I'm studying creoles at the minute on my linguistics course
C	oh are you?
B	and I was just interested to think what what version did she speak? cos there're I mean there are hundreds of creole languages hundreds I'm currently studying Nigerian pidgin English I have to do a presentation on the phonology of Nigerian pidgin so I just was interested to know what her descendants were and what what she spoke
C	from Jamaican and an and an island called St Elizabeth off Jamaica
B	then she speaks Jamaican creole I would imagine which is creole English
C	mm
B	it's it's crazy when you listen to it
A	it used to worry me when I spoke to her because I I knew that I was gonna struggle to understand
C	oh god I remember when I dated er in the early days I used to go I don't understand what your mum said she goes rather than just go cos us going yes yes
C	and she'd go oh it's you know whatever you
C	er
B	did she ever say E or day? E being he or she or anything like that
C	oh yeah yeah
B	and
A	yeah
C	they slip lots of letters off all the time
B	and day E day come
C	yeah
B	E day come round come here
C	yeah that's right
B	it's like I'm learning it at the minute there's all sorts of strange
C	yeah
B	in Jamaican creole but the grammar comes from the original African languages
C	yeah so it's mixed
B	so the underlying grammar is just a mix of language and
C	yeah
B	erm it's actually really hard to study because you need to have an understanding of the lexifier language be in the colonial language so either English French Portuguese or Spanish then you need to have some understanding of the the substrate language which is the African languages then you also need to have a bit of understanding about the local language cos as well depending on where they were moved
A	oh my goodness
B	if there were already local people there they could have influenced the language as well
C	dialects are amazing aren't they?
A	yeah yeah
B	so
A	yeah
C	when you think of the dialect we have just in one country this country
B	yeah
A	it amazes me
C	well they're
A	yeah yeah
B	it's erm well they're dialects accent is just pronunciation dialect is grammar as well so if for example if I say arse and you say ass
C	yeah
B	that would be an accent but if I say we were and you say we was
C	yeah
B	that would be a dialect
C	dialect
B	yeah so
C	yeah that's er true
B	if the words change and they use different grammar that's a dialect
C	I remember his dad he he could never say forty he'd go farety
B	farety
A	yeah farety-far
B	I like I like the er Irish we we had an old lecturer you
C	oh you do be kidding me lad you don't knows
B	yeah
C	no hang on how's he go?
B	well Irish
C	me Jesus me Jesus son
B	well the funniest thing he'd say you know erm at university the grades we don't get A B C D you get a first a two one a two two and a third well he'd always say you don't want I can't do the accent but
C	you don't want to do
B	you don't want to get a turd
C	turd
C	you don't want a turd slapped on the desk
C	that's right
B	you don't want a turd
C	so they would that's right they don't go the H the third
B	third no
C	it's turd
B	yeah and
C	and there's a similarity there
B	lots of creoles say ting instead of thing
C	oh yeah ting
B	lots of words sound like tin
C	yeah
B	yeah so tin yeah tin
C	instead of saying
B	so yeah I'm studying that anyway
C	instead of saying erm it used to be what's happening? you know what's happened today? it would be what happen?
B	mm they don't use the
C	but they say it so quickly what man what happen?
B	yeah
C	er well and that's what's happening
B	they don't use
C	what man what happen?
B	erm but
A	so what did you end up saying then?
B	quite often they'd say be instead of am
C	well I never used to go what happen?
A	no no when you said that you used to just kind of go yeah and smile
C	well
A	yeah
C	cultural thing
A	but then you said you used to say just
B	yeah that's called stylistic variation they change their theres
C	oh used to all the time
B	getting a bit technical now but like the furthest away from the lexifier language you know I said English was the lexifier?
C	yeah
B	the furthest way is called the basilect and the closest is called the acrolect so the quite often a speaker can use the basilect the mesolect and acrolect
C	yeah
B	depending on who they're talking to
C	that's right
B	so if they're talking to each other they will speak the basilect
C	oh yeah yeah
B	if they're talking to a white person they'll use the acrolect
C	yeah
B	as close as they can to
C	yeah
B	to the main language
C	yeah that's correct
B	so the variation on it
C	yeah so it was
B	yeah I notice though cos I spent some time in Belize and and Nicaragua and Honduras and they've got like I went to three different areas of of different creoles and I got fascinated by it at the time like when they spoke to me I could understand them more or less but when they spoke to each other I was like
C	yeah
B	words were coming through but
C	a gonna
B	I wasn't really
A	have you found that your travels has highlighted your interest in linguistics?
B	oh yeah definitely
C	it must do
A	mm
B	definitely
C	isn't it?
B	yeah I was just interested
A	mm
B	so it's Jamaican heritage on that on that side of the family
C	yeah St Elizabeth in er island off Jamaica
B	they don't use the copular verb so like be which is a linking
C	oh it's
B	it could I mean there's all sorts of variations it could
C	I and I
B	pidgins so they could just drop it and say I happy or they could drop they could say I be happy or there's all sorts of
C	yeah
B	variations to it
C	they do they drop they drop words
B	yeah
C	in sentences
A	excuse me
C	where you off to do a poo?
A	a poo
C	poo poos?
B	which one?
C	one two or threes?
B	three?
C	one twos or threesy?
B	what's three? time of the month?
C	no diarrhoea
B	lovely
B	what's that a mixture of the two?
B	one plus two equals three?
C	wees used to be one twos poos and three is diarrhoeas
B	lovely
C	oh god I know it is funny
B	you don't have an ashtray do you? I just keep just
C	no I just flick it over there and then chuck them in the pot
B	cool which pot?
C	there's a pot over there
B	see if I can get it in
C	I stopped putting them in the pot straightaway that's fine
B	I'll just leave that yeah
C	cos one day it started smoking and it must have been really dry and I thought Christ so I chuck them down there and then pick them up
B	yeah they drop the H they do
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	yeah it's interesting child can be pickanin or a pickaninny or a pickin
C	yeah
B	they'd say pickaninny for a child or for children
C	and it's like dat isn't it?
B	yeah dat
C	dat instead of that
B	instead of that yeah that's the er they don't have the fricative the they don't use that so it becomes a plosive de
C	no
B	so if they say dat they will change it all to dat any time thing will become a tink so there's two different types there's a th and a the
C	yeah
B	and one is voiced and one isn't
C	th and then th
B	isn't voiced and th is voiced so if it's the
C	th is more blowing
B	the
C	it's more vibrating innit?
B	so if it's got a vibration if it's the
C	the
B	then it becomes a de sound cos de also vibrates
C	the yeah
B	so the becomes de but if it's a
C	yeah
B	rather that dink it wouldn't be dink it would be tink I tink
C	yeah did you do that ting man?
B	yeah did you do that ting man? that tink
C	yeah
B	I tink I did it so I find it quite fascinating and kind of been studying it a little bit
C	and
B	yeah is she still going strong?
C	yeah yeah
B	yeah
C	she's about eighty-two
B	oh wow
C	I saw her I saw her the other day she irritated the bloody shit out of me
C	she was alright
B	why was that?
C	oh she said whenever you ring and speak to
C	yes
B	so shopping man every
C	every
B	syllable yeah it will be stressed yeah it would be stressed on every single syllable
C	yeah we just got shopping man
B	yeah
C	clearly
B	so
C	every shopping I've got to go shopping man
B	yeah so they stress every single syllable
C	can't do it the accent
B	no
C	yeah I know
A	there was a programme it used to be on television was it Paradise?
C	and the manners is weird the manners what's the what's
B	so does
C	what? oh yeah he used to he used to
B	he can speak creole does he?
C	he used to break into it er sorry when he was with his mates
B	yeah Jamaican creole
C	yeah what man and do the thing with the finger and yes and get over excited and all that and then
C	go and do the lingo
B	yeah
C	lingwo lingo
B	do you know they've also got other words in it? like erm instead of know they say sabby which kind of sounds like savvy you know savvy?
C	savvy? yeah
B	but that's actually from Portuguese cos originally the Portuguese were the first people
B	erm what was I saying?
A	savvy savvy
B	savvy yeah so they've actually because er the first ever slave traders like the colonisers were the Portuguese so there's actually some Portuguese words that are used still in their language and because I know Spanish which is kind of similar to Portuguese so instead of saying the word know instead of I know it would be he sabby or something and sabby is from the Spanish
A	it been it would have been interesting if you if
B	oh she was?
A	when when she came and afterwards
B	so he knows Spanish then?
A	he knows more than he actually lets on yeah
B	yeah
C	he understands more than he speaks it
A	yeah yeah
C	you know cos usually you can pick it up a language can't you?
A	did I tell you he's got erm found a couple of tumours?
C	yeah I was there when he had the call
A	yeah oh that's right yeah you weren't you? mm
C	yeah but they'll just blast them off again won't they?
B	and a necrotic spider bite
A	yeah hopefully it'll heal up anyway sorry
C	pity it's a pity you can't talk you you wouldn't want to trust me talk to
C	about Israelites
B	oh is he?
C	and his and his black history
B	why Israel?
C	er because that's where you know Jesus came from the Israelites
B	oh okay so he's quite Christian then?
C	no he's he's just erm
A	is he on anything?
C	yeah weed and stuff all permanently but he's totally erm a gonna on it and he will sit and convince anybody and try and if you just say talking a load of rubbish he goes no I'm not he goes you just you don't can't accept you can't this and he goes look in the James Bible
B	mm
C	so it's everything in there so he goes by the old king James legal if you like legal guide to things
B	it's quite interesting back to creoles a little bit
C	but if you ever had the talk with him he'll drive you round the bend
B	yeah
C	yeah wouldn't
B	there's a
C	be able to get through to him
B	there's the Jesus movie have you ever heard of the Jesus movie? it's like the Jesus story but because most of the pidgins and creoles were actually documented by religious missionaries that went out they've turned the Jesus movie and done the same movie like two hundred times in two hundred different creole languages so you can go and download any version of the Jesus movie in any pidgin or creole they've like done the version
C	like Jesus of Nazareth that one?
B	so you could go and watch yeah you could go and watch it in Jamaican creole English and it would be like
B	the whole thing would be
C	oh what man yeah I just gonna walk on water get Peter over here
B	yeah
A	there's a programme
C	here see
A	there's a
C	not the here
B	yeah
C	here here
B	yeah
A	there's a children's programme called Rastamouse
C	yeah I know I've seen it
A	on television
B	what?
A	and they yeah and they talk they're mice with Rasta hats
C	yeah
A	and dreadlocks and stuff
B	sure thing
C	I cracked up
A	no I don't think they
B	well I mean that's part of their culture their religion I think
A	well yeah but not on a children's programme
C	I think they leave out the weed and smoking out
A	yeah
C	cos it's a kids' programme
B	well they're calling him a Rasta I'm sure they'll put two and two together when they get a bit older
A	but it's like all the if they talk like that
B	and they're like oh yeah Rastamouse just like you guys all went oh you know Magic Roundabout
C	Rasta
B	when you got older it'll be the same
A	oh god I know yeah I bet it will
C	The Magic Roundabout of course
A	yeah yeah
C	you didn't think then did you?
A	no no
C	what The Magic Roundabout meant
A	I mean Dylan the bloody
B	drugged-up dog or whatever it was
A	rabbit yeah
B	I don't really know The Magic Roundabout but
A	chill man
C	Dougal the dog was it?
A	yeah Dylan was a rabbit wasn't it?
C	and Zebedee was on the bouncy thing
A	yeah
C	and that's all I remember
A	er erm then you've got the rabbit that played the guitar
A	that was kind of like chill man
C	so what were you saying about Rastamouse?
A	oh just about the the
C	cool is this your cat?
A	conversation the whole programme is
C	is all in in that dialect
A	in
C	yeah
B	oh
C	you'll you'll have to when it's on say get
A	and to begin with yeah
C	watch Rastamouse
B	some people would argue that there aren't really any languages as such there are just dialects there there's a famous quote that a language is merely a dialect with a navy and an army
C	mm
B	and that's it
C	that sounds interesting
B	that's all it is yeah but er
A	what does that mean?
B	it's called a language because I'm of a different country to you and therefore I'm speaking a different language to you for example in in parts of Pakistan and in India one language is Urdu the other language is Hindi it's the same language it's exactly the same but one has a different alphabet to the other but it's the same they call it a different language cos they're different countries and therefore they don't speak the same language they speak different languages
C	yeah cos it's all
A	ah right yes yeah
B	so a language
A	yeah
B	is a dialect with borders and
C	it's all to do with who's who's in charge who's got the power and who says what
A	mm
B	but erm what defines a language what defines if we're speaking the same language is what's called mutual intelligibility can I understand you?
A	mm mm
B	if I can understand you then we're speaking the same language and you can actually trace on a map of Europe you can start you know at England and if you go from here to say Frisian in like Dutch we can kind of understand them a bit and then if you take them to Dutch they'll understand each other and Dutch to German they'll understand each other German to Austrian you can keep following that line and you can trace it right across Europe where along that line
A	because English is the
B	they'll understand each other but if they're not right next to each other they won't understand each other
C	no
B	and you can see how the dialect changes
C	is English the main language throughout the world?
B	do you mean the most spoken language or?
C	yeah I mean the most erm spoken around the world
B	not
C	as in
B	not in first
C	or is it French?
B	not as a first language erm Mandarin is the biggest language Chinese
C	Mandarin?
B	yeah
C	is it?
C	oh
B	but as as second languages go yes English is the most
C	English is
B	spoken as a second language like for people learning
C	and is that because
A	to communicate
B	another language as a
C	and is that just because years and years ago we owned or?
B	we colonised yeah
C	yeah
B	we
C	no
B	and unfortunately to a certain degree I'm part of that because I'm teaching English er the way I see it is I think it's a good thing for everything
C	well yeah you're you're an Englishman you was teakening teaken teaching English
B	teaching English yeah
C	to other
B	part of me feels bad about that that you know I'm
A	you're instilling English into them
B	yeah however I don't think it's a bad thing for everyone to share a language I don't think we should lose language I think you should keep your culture and retain your own language
C	I don't think there's anything to feel bad about you're an Englishman
B	but I think
C	who's grown up and learnt er er and been educated and you're using what you know best with what you can do
B	mm
A	it won't stop them using their own language
C	to to erm
B	no
C	what you're interested in
A	mm
C	and to earn money
B	but the best jobs
C	why
B	are where the oil is mm
A	mm
B	I feel a bit bad on that front you know what I mean?
C	so you're going off to Saudi?
B	it's where the better jobs are and they've hit erm the teaching English scene is really burgeoning and proliferating in Kazakhstan nowadays and this kind of area
C	what's profitherlating mean?
B	proliferating burgeoning same thing erm developing lots more is happening
C	oh right
B	like it's growing around that area
C	yeah
B	so like erm Kazakhstan is really up-and-coming and they're starting to pay more because they've hit oil there they're finding a lot of oil around that area so effectively the English teachers are following where they're finding oil because you find oil and then the local people get wealthy and then they want more wealth so they wanna be a part of the you know
C	so they build houses
B	the business and then they start
C	they build extra things they build
B	and they start learning English and doing this kind of stuff so it's just part of my job I don't wanna stay as an English teacher forever
C	what about Dubai?
B	yeah that's good it's a good job
C	that's a good one a lot of people go there don't they?
B	yeah it's slightly more liberal than Saudi as well but it's also harder to get a job there I probably already have to have experience working in the Middle East to be able to go there so therefore I need to go to a lesser country first to be able to go but er Dubai
C	how safe is it?
B	Bahrain Abu Dhabi are pretty good
C	mm
B	and there'll be armed guards around the compound and all that kind of stuff so I mean
A	mm
B	Turkey's pretty good Turkey pays quite well Europe really doesn't pay very well for English teachers at all because they just have so many of them
C	so Saudi's the best because of the of the fact that they're
B	Saudi's not the best
C	they're
B	it's not the best it's er one of the hardest places to live in the world like
A	for women?
B	most most people don't er not just for women for men for everyone so I mean it's especially difficult for women but it's
C	so would that would that be a lot of religious culture stuff? you'd have to
B	Sharia law yeah I mean
C	cover up
B	would have to wear a full-on headdress all the way to the ground she would have to walk behind me in public erm neither of us
C	well that's fine you can handle that
B	that's cool
A	it's whether she can handle it isn't it?
B	even though we've been together for
C	no that that was a joke
A	oh
B	even though we've been together for nearly ten years if we weren't married we couldn't be seen in public we couldn't touch each other I couldn't go round her house I couldn't be anywhere as it is even if we are married we won't be able to work at the same institutions I'll be a boys' university she'll be at a girls' university
C	oh so why go there? just for the money?
B	I mean
C	with all the restrictions on you as a couple
B	yeah it pays well like it doesn't actually
C	so the money outweighs your lifestyle?
B	yeah for a year it's fine we I mean I can
A	does
B	yeah er we can
A	she'll be quite happy to wear the full headgear and
B	I mean we we both if we can find the same amount of pay and perks in another country we'll go there
C	yeah
A	yeah
B	rather than Saudi but
A	that is a big thing for her to have to live like that for a year
B	but if we can't but we know that if
C	would you have to cover up or do anything different?
B	erm I would probably have to wear the white head turban
A	yeah
C	mm
B	but I would anyway
C	bit of rope round
B	because it's hot as balls there
A	yeah
B	so you'd want to be more comfortable I would have all sorts of restrictions I can't walk to a random woman I can't be anywhere near them you know what I mean? erm unless they're family you can't be around them you can't spend any time with them whatsoever
C	oh for god's sake
B	so it's pretty difficult erm what's most scary to me
C	what if you slip up and get your hand cut off?
B	yeah I mean it happens they they still have in the market every weekend
C	I know
A	and stoning
B	they chop people's hands off and stone people erm you can't
B	you don't have access to your passport you have to apply to leave the country
C	don't go there
B	no but
A	how could you put yourself in that situation?
B	but you know I love to live in interesting places
A	I know I know
B	this is one of the most fascinating parts of the world like the way it's medieval it's not
A	I know I know
B	you know what I mean? it's like going back in time you know what I mean?
A	for the experience isn't it? blimey
B	and the amount of money that we could save in one year we could travel Africa for an entire year on that on one so effectively if we have a bit of a crappy year for a year whereby we exercise eat healthily and I try and do some writing and study Spanish and then the next year we're no work at all for a whole year it's worth it for us
C	really so that pays that well?
B	the pay isn't that great like in Korea
C	oh
B	I was on about fourteen thousand pounds that was all I was on but because they cover my rent and bills were covered in my last job and the cost of living's low
C	so that's your money
B	I could save about seven hundred pound a month
C	yeah
B	every every month Saudi pays about twenty thousand twenty to twenty-five thousand pounds a year and again rent's covered and bills are covered so you can save about fifteen hundred pounds a month in Saudi Arabia so
A	yeah
B	in one year I could save like fifteen thousand pounds and that's not gonna happen anywhere else I mean you'd need to be on like forty fifty-sixty K in England to save fifteen hundred pound a
C	so are you doing your masters now?
B	yeah
C	which will then give you what? opportunity of what? lecture?
B	I can teach at universities in in the Middle East so
C	mm
B	I'm preparing students to go to
C	well you like that don't you?
B	yeah
C	you're good at that
B	so basically what you're doing then is getting students up to the level where they can go and study in America or study in England
C	yeah
B	because they're at a good enough academic level where their writing is good enough
C	yeah
B	and so I'm at teaching English that will move to academic writing
C	yeah
B	and then eventually it'll move to teaching linguistics and then I'm teaching others er probably somewhere in the middle will be teaching others how to teach English so there'll be people that want to teach English and I'm teaching them how to teach English
C	so
B	and then the final step will be teaching linguistics itself in a European university but to do that I need a PhD
C	yeah
B	so
A	that's what
B	that's another bunch of years so you know what I mean? I to be able to fund a PhD I need to be able to have enough money to live on for four years that's a lot of time you know what I mean?
C	well when you when you say go back go back where?
B	well at that point if we already had experience in Saudi then we'd probably try and get I mean Kazakhstan as I said is doing quite well so we might end up going to Kazakhstan or we'd go to Dubai or Bahrain or somewhere a little more liberal but it's still in the
B	yeah
C	and he said too dangerous now and he's come back to England
B	yeah I mean they're not the safest of places
C	mm
B	we wouldn't be able to travel that easily there
C	the military he said
B	but
C	the military gave him advice to get out when
B	it's closer to England I'd only be a five to seven-hour flight from England so it would be closer
C	mm
B	I can travel Africa and the Middle East which is what we wanna do so it's just a much better reason
C	apart from the Middle East stuff are there no other countries you prefer to er teach in? it alway it seems to be the Middle East stuff
B	okay well this is the this is the problem with my field where you actually want to go where the
C	a month yeah
B	that's nothing you
C	and what about in this country?
B	they don't need to pay people very much and erm in Argentina
C	well what would you be paid in this country?
B	right now with my qualifications I could be about twenty-five grand erm teaching ESL in a college or something like that I could do that now
C	yeah
B	but
C	and the lifestyle for you is boring
B	I couldn't save very much on twenty-five grand really
A	no because of the cost of living
B	the cost of living here I could I could save
C	yeah but hang on there'd be
B	but maybe four hundred three hundred a month
C	is
A	mm
B	yeah we have exactly the same qualifications
C	so you'd have twenty-five grand coming in that's fifty grand between you
B	yes but twenty percent is tax ten percent is National Insurance I whack on another ten percent in my student loans then you've got council tax then you've got you know all sorts of taxes on top you end up paying fifty percent in tax before you've ever done anything VAT twenty percent of every single thing you buy it just it's not cost-effective I can earn and save better money elsewhere now once I have my PhD I can get a job as a lecturer and I get forty thousand pounds a year so that's the only
C	so you're over here in Brighton for a year to do your masters
B	yeah
C	then once you've both got that then you'll go you want to go to the Middle East because the money's out there
B	do you want my ten-year plan?
C	no I'm just getting the short-term one
B	the short-term so yeah
B	after the
C	have you?
B	pretty much
C	okay so after the masters it's out to the Middle East?
B	so
C	for money
B	year doing a masters year in the Middle East year in Africa two more years in the Middle East
C	hold it Africa we've got to what's that? Africa
B	travelling Africa
C	travelling leisure time
B	and also I'll do a well it'll probably be a bit more than a year because I'll need to do another three-month teaching qualification
C	I'd love to go there
B	which is Delta
C	well you you'd probably end up wanting
B	come out and join us
C	you'd probably want to stay in Africa
B	yeah I may well do I mean who knows?
C	yeah it'll be brilliant
B	who knows? erm so this plan may change
C	so are you so it's from from the Middle East to Africa that sounds a nice better place
B	yeah then but that's not to work I'll do a qualification
C	that's leisure
B	for three months while I'm there and then I'll travel for a year so I'll be there for probably about a year and a half it's very
C	do you speak French?
B	no but I'm gonna learn it while I'm living in the Middle East so that I can it's it's absolutely necessary
C	Africa innit mm
B	to like to travel there erm so let's say I continue on that plan I go back somewhere that pays well for example of the Middle East most jobs in the Middle East that are good are on a two-year contract which is why I'm gonna have to take not such a good job because I don't wanna work for two years I've already got itchy feet and I've just
C	why why well if you liked Africa do you think you would stay living out in Africa?
B	there's no money there there's no money I wouldn't get paid there nothing I'd have to most jobs are volunteering so I can volunteer and do some research and have my board covered but
C	so the this the the schools or colleges or whatever they have out there will be pittance money?
B	yeah there's nothing there there's no money erm China's coming on there's a lot more investment there like some British universities are teaming up with Chinese universities so in general Chinese universities
C	oh yeah
B	only pay about six hundred pound a month which isn't a lot but if you go and work for one of these combination unis then you'll get about twelve hundred pounds a month or thirteen hundred pounds a month but there's not many of these yet but a lot of people in my field are saying that China's just gonna keep going up
C	yeah yeah
B	and the pay's gonna keep going up
C	yeah
B	so it's possible we could go back and work there at some point so masters Middle East Africa
C	and then China I reckon
B	two more years somewhere that pays well then I should have enough to do a PhD and then a PhD takes four years so I'm already got ten years
C	so you definitely want to do your PhD?
B	yeah and we're probably gonna apply to do our PhD in America or Canada somewhere or Australia somewhere
C	oh you've got lived in America have you?
B	no somewhere because as well you've got more chance of getting funding
C	yeah
B	if you're a foreign student than if you're not
C	so when do you get the professor title?
B	so I'll have to apply to loads of so once I have a PhD
C	oh
B	and I'm teaching at a university I'm already a professor in some countries the the what makes a professor changes in Korea anyone that works at a university is a
C	no cos the standard is higher
B	no
C	so what would you be here in?
C	you'd be a lecturer here now?
B	no no no I can't even work at university not even with an MA maybe with an MA if I taught ESL if I taught English teaching English as a foreign language with enough experience and with a masters you can teach at a uni but if I wanted to teach for example there are two courses running close together in my uni one is an ELT course English Language Teaching and when I look at all the lecturers there only three out of ten have their doctorate the other seven just have masters and lots of experience however on the course I'm doing all the
C	yeah and it's larger America isn't it? it's
B	so in England I wouldn't be a professor until I'm like fifty I'd have to get a job at a uni and I'm like forty and
C	yeah and your hair would be long and you'd have a big forehead and a brain and you'd be like in tweeds
B	big grey beard
C	yeah
B	tweed jacket
C	yeah
B	yeah then maybe I'll live in England
C	when did you realise you liked studying and found the
B	when I went to uni I think
C	bug for it?
B	when I went to uni
C	was it just at uni?
B	yeah I admired all my professors and decided that's what I wanted to be and that's what I wanted to do I enjoy teaching it's the problem
C	mm
B	but we love Europe and we love European culture
C	mm
B	and we like being close to family and friends so
C	yeah
B	if we could get a job you know at a Dutch university or if it's in a Spanish university then we'd probably go there but still we need a PhD to do that so
C	so that would be nice to settle if you when you eventually if you have a family to bring up your children
B	yeah
C	not too far away and in a culture that you'd perhaps be happy with
B	yeah
C	them growing up in
B	somewhere you can have a bit of fun as well as not just know what I mean?
C	yeah and not have to sort of two miles have have your have your
B	even Korea's not that easy
C	have your daughters walk down the road behind you
B	quite a few people go to Korea and say it's too hard I can't live here
C	plus nanny you'd nanny would want to be involved
B	mm
C	and er great aunt
B	mm
B	definitely
C	yeah
B	so
C	so that's
B	yeah I'd I'd say so erm
C	which puts you about forty
B	I would say
C	fortyish could be becoming a dad?
C	yeah
B	but the problem is
C	oh
B	have I not discussed this with you before?
C	no no
C	yeah so did I
B	and in her family they hit it quite young so erm we've seriously discussed if we're ready to have children at that point we may adopt because if I mean if she can have children at that point
C	yeah
B	then maybe that will be but I don't see us being ready to have children for ten years not if this is what we do wanna do however this may change I may do my MA now completely fail it not do very well in and and if I don't do well in my MA there's no way I'm gonna get accepted onto a PhD so
C	and what would you do if you failed? do you have to redo it? it's cost every time isn't it?
B	I mean I wouldn't I wouldn't fail but if I don't get a really good grade I'm definitely not gonna get funding for a PhD so if I get an A my a first a distinction my chances of getting funding are massively increased
C	mm
B	if I get a two one a B a merit then I'm probably gonna have to pay to do it myself to do a PhD maybe I can get part-funded for something
C	mm
B	if I get lower than that I get a C a two two then
C	what's what's
B	I'm not gonna be able to go on and do a PhD
C	what's the best thing about teaching out in Korea? I mean is it very rewarding with all the kids? you're with with the older children now aren't you?
B	erm I didn't really like working in public schools to tell you honestly I had to do it to get the experience but
C	mm
B	I definitely enjoyed more working at a university
C	no I meant your job I mean it must be like fantastic to be in a different country and have the heat and
B	well my erm
C	a laid-back lifestyle and
B	what I really liked about my job was I had no office hours so
A	we need to go in a minute
B	do we have to go? god
A	yeah
B	I really liked having no office hours so can I have one more cigarette and then go is that alright?
A	as long as we're there for five
B	what's the time now?
A	twenty-five to
B	well we should be shouldn't we?
C	oh he's only round the corner isn't he?
B	I had
A	by the tennis club
B	I had no office hours
C	yeah that's only ten minutes when
B	so when I finished teaching I went home which meant sometimes my teaching blocks were lovely I came in and did from nine till twelve and then I'm done for the day and you know I've got planning to do but I can sit in my pants at home on the computer
C	yeah
B	and do it
C	yeah
B	so I like that freedom
C	yeah
B	and the responsibility I had I I had to to completely grade them I had to observe them I had to make up the exams for the classes I had to it was nice to have yeah I had to write the exams and then mark the exams and do speaking exams as well as written exams so I give I'm giving them a grade that goes towards
C	yeah
B	their final mark
C	yeah
B	you know what I mean? in English but I wasn't teaching the majors in English I was teaching all majors so I actually had a lot of engineering students
C	yeah
B	part of their degree meant that they had to do it so once I had my MA then I can move into teaching English students they're there to study English
A	mm
B	and then they'll be much better behaved and they'll be much better students but actually it was
C	so did you find that hard then the
B	it's a challenge yeah I mean my last
C	cos it is as a teacher isn't it?
B	oh yeah
C	to get the kids interested
B	mm definitely
C	is the first bit isn't it?
B	I think a very important part
C	at all
B	is to hold no grudges against them whatsoever I had a girl in my last er one of my hardest classes I had to teach was a their major was music and and
C	yeah
B	you know what I mean? I'm not interested and
C	yeah
B	most I told my colleagues and they'd all all they were like I'd hate that person I just blah blah blah I think if you take how a student reacts personally you're not gonna be a very good teacher
C	you can't no
B	and you're not gonna take it well I didn't I made an effort to
C	you have to
B	to make some kind of connection with her and to get her to understand
C	cos you're the teacher and you're there to
B	and I tell you what by the end of the class she was friendly with me and she liked me
C	yeah
B	and she she did better than she would have done I think had I neglected her
C	yeah
B	in the class erm I don't take any of it personally
C	because you always gotta think you don't know what these kids
B	no
C	what's going on outside
B	exactly
C	or in their personal life
B	and I I actually think it's quite important perhaps to have teachers
C	and it's a very responsible position being a teacher
B	that weren't necessarily good students I wasn't a very good student at school so I can look at those people and say you know what? when I was in your position I didn't wanna be here either
A	mm
B	so I understand where you're coming from and I can empathise with that
C	yeah
B	I think that's an important attribute for a teacher but
A	mm
C	er er yeah absolutely yeah
B	so erm I'm looking forward to teaching people that definitely do wanna do that but I I really enjoy being at the uni way more than I enjoy being in the public schools because they really didn't wanna learn you'd get a few students that would always help you out and they'd always volunteer answers and stuff but
C	and it just makes your job like so
B	but the majority yeah were difficult
C	why am I here?
B	you'd spend you know
C	and what's it like where you are now?
A	most of the time looking after the class
B	I'm not teaching now
C	no
B	I'm just studying
C	no yeah what's it like where you are at the uni?
B	oh the uni? I love it
C	what?
B	I mean my reading list per I'm doing four modules at the minute and every week they sent me homework each module and if you
A	jeez
B	if you haven't done that when you come to the seminar well you haven't got anything to contribute
C	yeah
B	so you can't talk about it but each module of those four sets me probably assigns ten books a week that you have to read you don't read the whole book but they'll be like here's ten books read chapter one and two of this book
C	yeah
B	read read chapter four of that book read chapter
C	yeah
B	so you're reading about forty chapters a week which is probably about four books a week
C	yeah
B	I've got to get through about four books
C	yeah feeding your brain all the while aren't you?
B	yeah I've learnt a lot already
C	with information
B	so erm there's a lot of work
C	well what are the other students like? are they similar ages or all ages?
B	it's quite a young crowd actually
C	backgrounds or
B	out of twelve of us on the course there's only three that are British erm two are Saudi one's Polish one's Russian one is er
C	you went to Russia didn't you?
B	no no I haven't I've been
C	oh you
B	through Russia
C	through Russia
B	I I changed plane in Moscow but I haven't
C	oh
B	I haven't been to Russia no I've been very close I went to northern China and it was Russian there were a lot of Russian people around and a lot of Russian culture because it was only about a hundred miles from the border with Russia but it
C	mm
B	they're very very very strict on their visa
C	the iron curtain as they used to call it
B	visa policy
C	not like here it's just yeah come in come over we'll house you and do your operation
B	basically
C	I know but then
B	so then
C	we're in a pretty safe country
B	mm
C	haven't got too much to worry about
B	mm it's got one of the highest crime rates in the world England it's in the top fifty out of three hundred countries in the world for you know crime rates
C	mm
B	I think it's fairly safe here there's no civil war or anything like that you know what I mean? but
C	yeah I'm on about wars not the crimes
B	but the crime rate's quite high
C	that's due you know
B	but it depends how you judge crime rates cos I mean
C	that's the police force innit?
B	Korea has one of the lowest crime rates in the world but the reason is that a lot of the crimes that happen they don't consider crimes they just overlook it
C	yeah
B	it would be a crime in England but it
C	so it wouldn't be reported would it?
B	no cos like for example
C	so what I stabbed my dad he upset me?
B	no not not not quite to that degree but like
B	like traffic their laws they don't seem to have any laws on the road they just go they drive through red lights if they want to and all that kind of stuff
A	they're mental aren't they?
B	there there's just no the
C	so the older you get the easier you get off with stuff
B	mm you also become a scapegoat though I don't know if you heard about that boat sinking
C	yeah
B	in Korea killed like three hundred people
C	yeah
B	they completely blamed it on this the
C	were you over there when it happened?
B	oh yeah yeah it just happened not far off the coast to where I used to live it was probably about thirty miles off the coast it was terrible three hundred children died
C	yeah I know
B	you know why they died?
A	did they leave the
B	partly cultural it's an obedience thing they listened to their elders this is what I'm talking about this hierarchical thing and the the boat captain told them to stay still
C	even to the point where they were sinking
B	and this they there was them just staying there for an hour
A	oh my god
B	and then about forty-five minutes in the boat tilted and the boat tipped so imagine you were in the floor and now you're on the walls and you can't get out so they had all the boats there to rescue them and they could see the children inside but they couldn't get them out
A	oh my god
B	and the boat just sunk yeah it's terrible and that they completely blamed the ship captain and he committed suicide and a bunch of other people committed suicide over it they lost face the the head the
A	oh my god
B	it was really horrific and we were there it was really bad it's a bit of a cultural problem it's like if somebody above you says do this personally I I think the teachers were mostly to blame not him
C	yeah was gonna say what about the people looking after the kids' safety?
B	the the captain didn't know exactly what was going on exactly exactly and what about the
C	what were they doing? going stay there?
B	what about the children themself? they weren't young they were like middle schoolers and
C	yeah
B	and er so they should have been going hang on a minute I'm on a boat there's a problem isn't the safest place on deck where I can potentially jump off? no they some of them got in cupboards I don't know what they thought was going on but they climbed into cupboards and were like texting their parents saying you know there's something wrong we don't know what it is but it's okay I'm safe I'm in a cupboard
A	oh gosh
B	it was horrific
C	uneducated it's uneducation
B	pretty much all of pretty much all of the adults got off
A	oh
B	and the captain got off as well but the problem is that by the time it the
C	so where were the kids? below deck?
A	yeah
B	yeah they were all inside and they were all told to stay inside so they stayed inside and then
C	well what happened to man woman and
B	well they weren't evacuating at this point they didn't know the boat was sinking they the
A	jeez
B	there was all sorts of things that hadn't happened it was just a series of bad events
C	mm
B	but the adults that were on board
C	so there was no safe there was no health and safety in there at all
B	once they heard a bang no they all went they all went out onto the deck so that when the boat started to tilt they were ready to jump off
A	they could get off yeah
B	and they did so all the adults just
C	and nobody went to rescue the kids?
B	they couldn't get them out the boat was can you imagine? like there's the exit how do I get to the door?
C	oh right yeah and they're down yeah
B	you know what I mean? the door's above me you they couldn't get out it's terrible because there's pictures of
C	so they drowned
B	there's pictures of the people rescuing them on the boat looking in looking in at the children and they couldn't get them out
A	oh Jesus Christ
B	erm these children all drowned
C	did they?
B	it was horrific yeah it was
C	Jesus
B	it was a it was a massive catastrophe the thing is exactly the same thing happened fifteen years ago and exactly the same thing happened fifteen years before that they've had three big boat catastrophes and I mean I've used these boats quite a bit I went to Jeju on exactly the same boat that sunk it was going to Jeju
C	so nothing's been learned from it?
B	I wouldn't have died though I'd have got off the boat and swum and the thing is in Korea you're never far from land they were no more than two hundred metres from land
A	oh my god they could have swum
B	yeah mm some would have died but some would have definitely got off
A	we need to go
B	it's terrible isn't it?
C	yeah
B	I'm going to go to the toilet would you guys keep talking when I go to the toilet and then I'll
C	oh and then switch it off okay
B	no there's no need to switch it off I'll keep it going in the car while I'm
A	okay
C	okay
A	are you alright?
C	yeah
A	well er are you off tomorrow?

A	no I don't feel jittery just feel a bit sickie
B	a mint?
A	yeah something I dunno just oh I imagine it'll go it'll go
B	do you have a mint?
A	no I don't
B	yeah
A	in
B	I don't know where we are though so
A	I'm coming now there's an Audi a new Audi's just on the corner here
B	oh yeah
A	yeah
B	I'm near
A	yes yes heard anything from him?
B	no it's terrible
A	yeah
B	I've I'm waiting for him to message me now I'm not gonna
A	disappointed with him really
B	never mind
A	cos you've done so well this far to keep in contact all these years it'll be a shame now for it to go quiet
B	oh well that's life isn't it?
A	yeah
A	but then you have erm friends at different times in your life sometimes for different reasons
B	unfortunately I don't really live anywhere near him so
A	no
B	well I'm sure I'll see him I'm not gonna
A	mind you I haven't seen
B	I'm not gonna erm go we're not gonna go the whole year without seeing each other are we? but might not see each other much I'm sure he'll come up to
A	yeah
B	maybe no more than that
A	oh god I thought that car was going in there and I could have just clipped the end of him
B	was it not going in?
A	well he just stopped oh
B	oh
A	sorry
B	isn't much some good driving there
A	it was wasn't it?
B	stay in third gear
A	it does work cos you hear the engine revving too fast
B	oh if you go more than thirty?
A	yeah just trying to think if I get oh I know if I can just go straight down here that's
B	yeah there was the park up the road
A	yeah that's good then
B	oh excuse me
A	excuse you
B	you and
A	yeah
B	that's good
A	yeah nice
B	you drifted for a little while didn't you?
A	yeah we did yeah we went through a
B	why?
A	er
B	yeah
A	erm I don't think I was honest with her how I felt about things and erm
B	yeah
A	and I got irritated by things I think I don't know
B	did you have any big rows or anything?
A	er no not really but I think when all that happened for her when her life changed I ended up kind of being more honest and open with her about stuff that I felt as well
B	yeah
A	so erm it kind of made us understand each other better
B	gotta be honest haven't you? you can't
A	yeah
B	do these things
A	but then you you grow you're learning all the time aren't you? about yourself as well and about other people and your
B	it's strange you have to learn about yourself isn't it?
A	yeah
B	you'd think you'd know yourself being yourself but problem is as well you're trying to learn about an ever-changing person we change so
A	yeah and I think also other people help you see yourself cos you think you're one way and then you might have a falling out with someone or they might say something to you and you and you think god is that really how people see me?
B	yeah
A	and then you think well actually when you start looking inwards that's the only way you ever learn and it's taken me a long long time to be able to learn about myself
B	oh
A	and thinking okay well maybe I caused that or maybe if I hadn't reacted in that way or
B	yeah I didn't feel good that I was stressed when you came down the other day about that pub
A	oh don't worry
B	I have to tell you honestly I was kind of smoking at that point and trying not to let you know
A	oh really why?
B	I was actually erm
A	you're you're your own person
B	I know
A	if you're smoking you're smoking it's not you know
B	I was really craving at that point
A	oh you daft thing
B	and
A	I don't I don't judge you by how you react on a certain time or day you wanted it to be nice and it wasn't the way you wanted it to be at that point
B	but I think
A	yeah she said that to me as well cos I said
B	which is the truth because
A	yeah
B	we travel or like for example I I think we said to each other the other day
A	yeah
B	you know we did well not to get annoyed about moving in and there's a massive nursery behind us like really we just kind of
A	I'm never gonna get out if I don't push
B	we just kind of took it
A	yeah
B	but and then I kind of said well that's cos we can't change it can we? I'm not gonna move house or do something like that
A	yeah
B	but if there's something that I could have avoided or I could have changed then I guess I beat myself up a bit and
A	yeah
B	get a bit annoyed about it
A	yeah
B	that's when I get stressed
A	I think I'd like to see you
B	yeah
A	because it's not good for you to feel that
B	me too no and
A	stressed about it
B	me too I don't like getting hit up and stressed
A	and I don't want you to feel on edge when
B	I mean I wasn't that stressed when you were there were you?
A	no not at all not at all but I know you well enough to know that those things bother you
B	yeah
A	and you want it to be right
B	yeah I am
A	so that is something that would like relax you more if you just especially us
B	yeah I know
A	you know I I wanna I want you to just kind of you know just not be worried about what we think or feel or those kind of things that go round in your head
B	yeah so I don't think it helped that I'd been smoking a few days before that
A	I can't believe at twenty-eight you didn't want me to know
B	well the problem is once you've told people you'd quit and then if you start again you feel a bit like oh god
A	oh god well I did that many years many years
B	you just feel a bit you know like you've failed don't you? a bit guilty don't you?
A	yeah
B	mm
B	smoked a few in a row I think
A	did you feel you know did you enjoy the afternoon? cos we did
B	oh yeah yeah no I did
A	did you feel relaxed? and I mean you kept popping in when
B	well you kept taking her off didn't you? let's walk home whoops I forgot my keys
B	yeah
A	she was just so you know
B	well I'm glad you two get along
A	just yeah I hope she did with me too but she's
B	I know she did she's
A	I just
B	she thinks my family are very talkative and very chatty
A	oh that's nice
B	to get on with
A	but erm it was lovely really enjoyed it it was just nice to go up to the park and you were lovely with
B	yeah no it was good I just felt bad and you know I don't like people seeing me stressed
A	really?
B	yeah yeah not terribly but like yeah I have moments and
A	how does she deal with that?
B	oh we have a quick row and then it's over it's not you know and I apologise
A	does she kind of like calm you?
A	mm
B	if it's something she's doing then it's probably not gonna help
A	you like to be king in your own kitchen
B	well I just I I needed her to help me at that point not you know I was trying to make hummus a chilli and pack up for tomorrow and
A	and then the blender broke
B	we've got enough stress
B	and I was just like I needed her to know what to do at that point
A	yeah
B	and I was just annoyed because we've cooked those things so many times if I can remember it why can't you? and it was just
A	oh god I think this is the wrong road
B	erm
A	yeah I think
B	yeah
A	I think that I've gone wrong
B	and if you're not helping you're actually making things harder
A	mm
B	it's just kind of like ah but I apologised and I gave her a hug
A	oh no we saw this didn't we when we came out? I think it's down here
B	I said I was sorry but she
A	and does she accept your apologies or does she kind of?
B	yeah she just says she's said a couple of times I don't know how you keep it all bottled up away from everyone else cos like I I mean you see it again because I'm close with you and
A	yeah
B	but I don't let it out dad doesn't see me get stressed
A	really?
B	really no erm and then my friends definitely don't I mean maybe
A	yeah
B	but like otherwise I keep it completely and I'm really calm around other people but
A	well I'll take that as a compliment
B	I mean you should do
A	that you feel that you can be as you wanna be
B	oh it's it's only people that I'm really comfortable with that I er do get stressed around because I don't care that they see me getting stressed about it do you know what I mean?
A	am I on the right road? can you see any balloons anywhere?
B	no and it was further down didn't you turn down
A	yeah I'll go back down I'll go oh god this is one way isn't it?
B	I hope not erm
B	yeah this is
A	no I think I've gotta go down oh maybe
B	didn't you drive down a road and then you said it was the third right?
A	this is the first after the rugby club isn't it?
B	I guess so yeah
A	yeah so it is this road the third on the right wasn't it? I need to turn around somehow but
B	yeah
A	I can't here unless I can quickly do it
B	I don't know how you do it I don't know about these kind of things what were you just saying?
A	erm
B	oh she's quite calm yeah but then I'm really calm around her family and she gets all stressed out so
A	yeah yeah
B	oh she does like er around her dad she's just stressing her out
A	does she?
B	quite badly so it just depends who you're around
A	is it what cos he irritates her?
B	yeah because she's comfortable around him
A	yeah
B	so if he does something stupid
A	yeah
B	then she tells him
A	yeah
B	but erm
A	right okay let's start again so it's third one on the right
B	so what was it and then something and left wasn't it?
A	yeah
B	so what we take the third turning on the right and then a turning on the left?
A	yeah
B	okay are we late? no we're just bang on time again aren't we? yeah but in general she is calm but I mean you know we've put ourselves through
A	I'm sure you complement each other
B	quite a bit of stress so
A	yeah
B	you know what I mean? I do worry that stress is bad for me I I had a bit of a bad stomach
A	it's not good for you
B	this first few weeks when I came home
A	well I should imagine that that is a knock-on effect isn't it?
B	and I was it did made me kind of think oh maybe we do need to calm down a bit and
A	yeah is there something you can do? I mean you do your yoga don't you?
B	yeah not enough at the minute
A	yeah
B	and then it was the first left
A	and the first on the left
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yoga definitely helps
A	so when you're feeling that stressed
B	we've just gotta stop smoking again smoking makes me stressed
A	does it?
A	you'd think that that would be make you calmer
B	I felt like I was less stressed when I didn't smoke for that year
A	oh god
B	but it doesn't because it helps you
A	yeah
B	but if you're not stressed
A	I wonder if I can get in there don't know if I'm that good
B	erm
A	mm don't know
B	where are you gonna park then?
A	oh blooming heck I'll back I'll go in backwards and I can do it
B	well that car's coming up
A	I can do it backwards just can't do it forwards just keep an eye on
B	eye on what?
A	don't know
B	yeah obviously I do have tendencies for it
A	I think you do I think you do
B	that was good parking
A	yeah it was wasn't it? high five mum
B	nice

D	down the window
A	yeah look
D	be careful though cos they get
A	okay
B	if they get

D	really dirty they get really dirty they stop working so you don't wanna drop him
B	you need to do it on something flat
A	try it on this window hold that but don't let it drop on the floor can you get your belt on quickly please?
B	can I hold the bouncy ball? not the rubbish
A	have you had a good party?
B	yeah
A	what did you do?
B	erm
A	I thought I saw your girlfriend out there
B	there were lots of girls weren't there?

B	there was yeah there was about five or six or so
A	lovely house though they had a teacher from my school was there as well her children were there
B	oh that's nice
A	yeah
B	oh oh that was cool wasn't it?
A	did you try it on the window?
B	stick it right at the top
B	it wasn't as good as that they've got better
B	they still do party bags then
A	oh gosh
B	that's like a pretty good party bag
A	I know it really is he's got like a a bird
B	are they a bit wealthy these ones?
A	huh?
B	are they a bit wealthy?
A	yeah I think so
B	from a different class aren't they
B	yeah don't forget got the power on
A	that's okay I'll just bash it out the way
B	there's a car coming as well
A	is there?
B	yeah it's
A	so I can't get out
B	pulling in maybe
A	what about your that other way?
D	oh my god
B	oh said if you get him dirty he dies
D	does he?
B	he's yeah he's allergic to dirt
A	are you coming through?
D	are you allergic to dirt?
B	parking where?
A	oh he's going in there
B	you get stuck in this place while everyone's trying to get in and out
A	probably
B	what else did you get in the bag then
A	that's his
B	who's this lady?
A	his headmistress yeah
D	this bird
A	she's lovely with her she really is she did a training in Iceland or or went to Iceland
B	yeah you told me that
A	yeah
B	they get paid pretty well headteachers
A	do they?
B	yeah I don't know about
A	but it's a big responsibility isn't it?
B	I don't know about in his school but I mean when I've seen job adverts for headteachers they're usually on about sixty grand
A	yeah
B	it's ridiculous
A	mm
B	but it is a lot of responsibility but when you think the teachers are only on about twenty grand
A	are they?
B	yeah teachers
A	are you sure they're not on more than that?
B	teachers start on twenty and finish on thirty you get paid a grand more for every I've got friends that are teachers you get paid a grand more for every year that you're there until it finishes at thirty
A	gosh
B	if you're a head if you're like a head of department like the head of English or something like that you'll get more
A	cor it's not much is it?
D	mummy
B	no my friend's
A	I mean I'm on
D	mummy
B	my friend's my friend's done her PGCE and she came out with
D	mummy
A	what am I on? twenty twenty-two?
D	mummy mummy
B	if you think that you need a degree
D	mummy
B	and then a PGCE
A	hold on darling
B	hang on a second
A	I know yeah
B	and a PGCE to be a teacher and you then start on twenty grand it's ridiculous
A	awful
B	what were you gonna say
A	what have you got?
B	Twirl
D	Twirl
B	oh is that for me?
D	no
B	oh
A	have you had much chocolate and sweeties
D	no
A	are you sure?
D	yeah
B	how much have you had?
A	okay
D	just one bit
B	one bit how big was the bit?
D	I had none
B	none to eat?
A	okay
D	yeah
A	alright well just have that then and we'll save your cake for later
D	fudgy
B	it's not fudge it's crumbly
A	is that a deal?
B	deal? do we have deal? shake on it just eat the Twirl
A	you'll be thirsty after that anyway
B	and save the cake for later
A	whoops
B	nearly stalled
A	you can have it today just have it later on
B	after dinner is
A	no
B	what's for his dinner?
A	he's got chicken
B	I'm getting hungry already
A	yeah me too I'm not sure we're gonna last
B	is
B	oh we've gotta have it when he's in bed?
A	well no I thought we might have an adult meal but I don't think so oh no
B	what?
A	what's happening? oh it's okay
B	I think they're just parking aren't they? small little car like that
A	oh I whizzed into that space really easy didn't I?
B	I know pro
A	I was quite impressed with myself right bypass let's go the bypass
B	shall we go on the bypass
D	uhu
B	it was
A	did he not?
B	do you not
A	was it that he didn't
B	I swear he didn't like
A	didn't like being left in the car?
B	no
A	oh that's it yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah he didn't like the speed
B	no
A	that was because
B	yeah
A	on a bike one day and they went whizzing down the hill and from then on he had a thing about going too fast
B	he was scared
A	yeah he
B	he got over that though?
A	he's not oh god yeah he's not bothered now
B	cos when I was here I remember he got really upset about going too fast but I mean it was near the airport or something in town
A	slow down slow down slow down yeah
B	yeah we're in the zone
A	yeah so if they thought we were going too fast then the road would tell us we have to slow down so we did all that really
B	er I have
A	is that tasty?
B	an interesting question
D	yeah
B	and I wanna know what they say
D	nothing
B	do you understand a hundred percent do you understand fifty percent does he understand percentages?
A	do you understand all of it or half of it or a little bit of it or nothing?
D	half of it
B	half of it
A	half of it
B	so when we're talking you only understand half?
D	yeah
B	yeah?
A	do you listen to it all or do you just kind of listen to some of it?
D	awesome
A	I I don't think you listen to it all do you?
B	I wanna find out what children think what how much they actually understand
A	it's amazing how much they take in
B	oh yeah definitely I'm learning all about erm cognitive science at the minute learning about language faculty erm and how children acquire language and how there are sets of
A	mm
B	just as a random sentence I eat so eat the complement to eat would be pizza in the bath the complement to pizza with be in the bath the complement to in would be the bath if you know what I mean the complement to the would be bath there it's head first which means that the complements come after the word but there are languages that would say I eat bath the in pizza it's the other way round
A	really?
B	yeah they're called head final languages Korean is head final language
D	awesome
B	so they found that there's parameters and they basically
D	awesome it's staying there
B	that we have the capacity in our brain our brain has a model for language already and all they cos originally behaviourists believed that children learn from positive and negative things that they listened and and they heard stuff
A	mm
B	but Noam Chomsky in the sixties turned around and said how is that possible when children can say things that they've never heard before? they can use constructions that and how is it that a child can hear us say things incorrectly yet doesn't repeat it? they don't there basically they believe that there's a framework underlying the language and all the child has to do is decide is it head first or is it head last? is it null subject or does it have a so I am gonna explain null subject in English we say I speak
D	awesome
B	with the speak we can't just say speak I we have to say I speak English not speak English but in Spanish they don't they just say
A	oh my goodness
B	for example another one when we make a question erm
A	you know what you sorry go on
B	for example the sentence what do you eat? the original sentence is actually you do eat what? but then the inversion process causes the do auxiliary to come first what do you eat? not you do eat what? what so the what moves to the beginning the do moves but certain languages don't move the what phrase that stays at the end so in English we have a head first W H operator in Chinese they don't it stays in the same place so the child just has to learn those switches learn whether we move those W H questions to the front or we keep them in place do you know what I mean?
A	yeah
B	so they think that it's called poverty of stimulus is the argument that there's no way that children have heard enough to be able to use as much language as they're using therefore they must already have the language and they just have to put the words of the language in
A	goodness
B	it's quite a crazy theory that they've been building on since the sixties and it's it's completely revolutionised a lot of fields about language er acquisition and how we do all this kind of stuff
A	you know what you said about erm not correcting them?
D	oh my god
B	yeah
A	because they correct themselves
B	yeah
A	I've been trying to not do that but er I can't remember like er what
B	don't not correct him
A	no
B	okay
A	not correct him because and what I've been see I did it what I've been saying to
B	that's a little bit different I understand what you're saying but we're confusing two slightly different things
A	like Mar-in
B	yeah we're confusing two different things though when I said that children don't learn from negative reinforcement I'm talking about grammar not about pronunciation
A	right
B	pronunciation you've got a problem with Mar-in because the elite standard says that you must pronounce the T Martin
A	but how do children learn to spell if they don't know how to say it properly?
B	well spelling and and pronunciation is arbitrary anyway how do you learn to spell the word enough even though it ends in a G H? you just learn it by rote process of doing it
A	yeah yeah
B	however what they're arguing is that children don't learn like if it's grammar so when he says I broked it even if you said no it's broken er I broke it
A	yeah yeah
B	that doesn't matter he will learn that anyway
A	right okay
B	so it's not pronunciation
A	so it's not right
B	it's grammar
A	okay
B	it's grammar pronunciation if you want him to speak what you would consider to be properly then yes you do need to reinforce that
A	yeah yeah
B	because you're trying to make him a set way
A	mm
B	but most languages in English follow the same grammar we all say I speak you speak he speaks so if he say he speak and you say no
A	yeah yeah
B	he'll get it himself regardless
A	I have stopped doing that I've just answered him with the right
B	the right
A	way of saying it
B	the right yeah you can do that
A	but
A	I know I know I do I mean you know
B	that's fine there's no problem with that
A	you know but with him like I did with you and with
B	yeah
A	Ss and you know all of that kind of thing
B	that's that's your personal preference
A	because I think it will help him with writing and spelling
B	yeah I mean that's fine and that's a good argument for it
A	because if he's doing his phonetics which is erm you know spelling out the letters whether we agree with it or not agree with it that's how he's learning
B	but that's
A	so when he comes to write it if he's seeing in his head Mar-in he's never gonna write it properly
B	but what if
A	and if he says Mar-tin
B	but what if we don't
A	and he breaks the word down
B	I agree with what you're saying but what about if we don't teach him phonetics what if we don't say a T is always te sound? what if T sometimes is a er sound? what if you can say Mar-in? what if that's another variant of the T sound? he'll still know that you spell it T you write it T but sometimes T can be pronounced differently if it's at the beginning of a word truck
A	but he won't know it at the moment will he?
B	or teacher you're always gonna say te you're always gonna say teacher he will he'll he'll recognise that because the rule that you're talking about isn't it's it's in a specific location it happens at the beginning of
A	baker yeah
B	so but we know that it's spelt E R because we understand that the E R sound can either be pronounced err or er
A	but he doesn't at the moment cos he's learning that
B	he will because he'll hear it whether or not you would know that he's doing it
A	ah
B	he'll learn that anyway he'll pick up that if I see say a T at the beginning of a word teacher it's always te sound but if I say a T in the middle of a word Mar-in it can either be er or te it depends on who I'm around and and
A	or who's saying it
B	or who's saying it
A	yeah
B	yeah so he will pick up that variation and to a certain degree decide on who he wants to copy
A	I'm sure he will yeah
B	which I do around
A	yeah
B	so I know what you're saying
D	mummy
B	but I don't want you to confuse
A	yes darling
D	look
A	I can't darling I'm driving
B	I can see
A	no no I
B	and grammatical reinforcement
A	well that's why I thought I'd mention it because
D	oh look
A	I can do the grammar
B	oh
A	and I can and I've done started ever since you've said about it not correcting just answering back with the right
B	yeah
A	way
B	he'll get it
A	er but I've found it tough not to correct speech
B	yeah and that's that's your preference if you want him to pronounce his words in a certain way then that's fine but that's different to grammar
D	awesome
B	that's different to the structure he will never say I pizza eat even though you'd think they'd try these variations from the immediate that they start speaking they'll always say and they'll probably start with pizza eat or
A	pizza
B	or I want I want or something
A	yeah
B	they'll never say want I
A	yeah
B	because they've already set those parameters
A	yeah
B	even though there are languages that say want I or eat or pizza eat so he's not gonna make those grammatical mistakes in fact by the age of him now he's almost got all of his grammar
A	whose bottom's that?
B	oh that's very smelly it's not mine
D	him
B	oh him
D	yes
B	one of the hardest things that children well one of the latest things that they have to learn is called passivise have you ever heard of the passive
D	hello
B	there are two types of sentence in English active and passive
A	I have heard of it but I am absolutely rubbish at remembering
B	so for example I broke the car is active passive is the car was broken by me
B	and I say
B	they don't know
A	hold on sweetheart
B	sorry er let me try and think of another example where it's no an cos that's an inanimate object so that makes it clearer erm so for example
A	yeah
B	by the monkey is that the monkey's kissing the lion so it it it takes that's the one of the last things that they learn but they learn it they still pick it up and you don't need to teach them that
A	that's incredible isn't it?
B	it's just that they it's and that's part of our structure
B	in English we have syntactic structural meaning that depending on how we order the words effects the meaning that in English we go subject verb object the monkey kissed the lion subject verb object but other languages they could say the monkey the lion kissed and because they add an extra little sound so they add what's called a morpheme which could be the monkey O the lion E kissed and the O implies that the that's who did it and the E implies that that's who it was done to so then you can put it in any order because you've got a little thing that tells you who's the doer and who's the receiver we don't have that English so we have to structure it in a set way to say who's doing what
A	very very interesting
B	the children set those parameters as a child they can learn any language and through just listening those parameters get set and they go okay English is a language where I have to structure they're not consciously doing that but it's a tacit it's er unconscious
A	no it is it really really is
D	yeah
A	erm show
B	you can count go on then
B	oh that was pretty good
B	I like that one
A	well done
B	yeah
D	no
A	to count
B	can you listen? in the sentence the zebra is kissed by the monkey who kissed who? the zebra is kissed by the monkey
D	the zebra
B	so
D	kissed the monkey
B	the zebra kissed the monkey? see he got it the wrong way round
A	interesting
B	it is interesting isn't it? if you say the zebra is kissed by the monkey
A	yeah
B	he just hears the zebra kisses the monkey
A	yeah
B	it's strange isn't it?
A	yeah
B	it's good to be able to test it cos another year or two and he will he'll know that you you won't have a problem
A	try and remember that sentence
B	yeah
A	and we'll ask him again
B	oh did you break it? do you want me to try and fix it
D	it has to go through the
B	oh it does shall I try?
D	don't mind
B	oh I told you it would break didn't I? these things always break
D	have to eat?
A	yeah
B	it's never gonna
D	nothing
B	it's game over
D	why?
B	because you're right the hole's too small and the man's leg's too big
A	normally they get all fluffy and then you can't use them at all
B	so if I asked him the toy was broken by
A	yeah
B	that a toy can't break him so therefore it must be this way round
A	yeah yeah
B	but with the zebra kisses the monkey either one can kiss each other so
A	yeah yeah
B	so it can go either way
