A	mm
B	arrested for drugs
A	yeah
B	and they let him go
A	had a petty
B	mm
C	well
A	like
C	the bloke did say he said
B	mm
C	we're in Britain
C	and our gun laws are very strong so if you see people with guns
A	yes it is yeah so you phone
C	it it really is quite strange how so
A	no
C	to be fair he said so
A	yeah
B	well when we were when we were going through to
C	he only pulls totty over you know
B	what? no they didn't they pulled over
A	the totty with the bogey?
B	excuse me
B	they pulled over six or seven cars and they just
A	yeah
B	anyway I was in the front row and while the sniffer dog was going around
A	because you don't say yes
B	yeah so I then said to him I said
B	you know
A	ask
A	yeah but no offence how many times have we driven through Calais and they've never checked our car once
B	well we got
A	I didn't
B	no when I went with
A	yeah I know yeah they check guns
B	and they they didn't just check it they stripped right or they they
C	stripped it
B	no they didn't strip the car they took everything out of the car
B	and the engines and they got roller
A	mm
B	and I said well what you looking for?
A	well that's the perfect disguise mother
B	well that's what he then said he said it's the farmers' wives who bring them through
A	the farmers' wives dad
B	well you see well that was at the time when the farmers were moving their guns abroad
C	was it?
B	yeah when when the
C	oh they stopped
B	they
A	didn't wanna give up their sporting guns?
B	so they were they were erm
C	oh were they?
B	mm
A	mm
C	didn't know that
A	mm
B	and it was the farmers' wives who were taking
B	no but it said no no but it had on the back of it Keep Britain Farming
A	well
B	it was all that fault of that little sticker
A	but that was ten plus years ago
B	it was ages it was more than that
A	yeah like
C	yeah
B	more than that
C	well she hasn't spoken to
A	I know
B	for ten years
A	well it's just
B	well they
B	well they

A	yeah I heard that today yeah
B	that was at Hannover last night
C	mm
A	mm
B	and two
C	well it's not a lot I mean
B	they were saying the worst problem is now
C	mm
B	because they're saying there's a bomb on board you've got to
A	yeah
B	so the the worst problem is it's nothing to do with whether there's a bomb on board or not
C	oh of course you do
A	yeah but you'd rather safe than sorry wouldn't you? you'd rather
B	mm but they were flying they were flying on those airbus things that we went to China on
A	mm
B	erm so you got

B	but but look at that time
C	Malawi yeah
B	Malawi
C	they took everything back off the plane yeah
A	mm
C	then you had to take your bags
B	and they lugged them on the
A	yeah
B	and you had to go and identify your baggage
C	and then put it
B	and put it on the luggage
C	on the loader
A	yeah
B	on the thing for the
C	and there was one bag left
B	there was one bag left yeah
A	good
C	so I dunno who hadn't missed their bag or what have you know
B	well
A	no no I understand the concept
B	it was erm whoa
A	mum how old were you?
B	I dunno but I was pregnant
A	well then dad should've helped you
B	he should've done but he didn't know I was pregnant so
C	how how much
A	well then you obviously weren't very heavy were you?
C	she talks talks some rubbish doesn't she?
A	yeah
C	just comes out with
B	mm
A	just because you're pregnant doesn't mean you can't lift things
B	it does
A	no it doesn't
B	she is isn't she?
A	she's
A	that's nearly four
C	well what's wrong with that?
B	no
C	oh right
A	she didn't lose the last one
C	is this the first baby? or the second one?
B	the second baby
C	oh
B	and she's she's had such an argument with
A	I would
B	I know she does
A	she does not she she yeah she has to stop eating
B	well if she didn't wear skin tight clothes it would help wouldn't it?
A	well not really then she'd look like a really frumpy whale
A	at least now she looks vaguely like a bit like a sexy whale
B	exactly she
B	well she looks like the Michelin Man
C	any gossip from
C	is she er where are they living now?
B	her husband's also retired
A	oh god
B	but they
C	what's
B	oh she loves it
C	what does she do there? what's she do there?
B	well they're doing the house up
C	still doing the house after five years?
B	mm well
A	how long have you been back in this house?
B	no
A	mm
B	but she said it's erm
A	cos
C	yeah
B	mm mm mm
A	private education
B	mm I know
A	private
A	and now she's in publishing apparently doing an internship
A	if you'd gone to state school
B	you went to a red brick university
C	and straight into
A	don't think
C	straight into
A	exactly
A	suck on that
C	yeah
B	swivel
C	and she's your age?
A	and now she's getting an internship whereas I'm paid
C	so what did she do between
A	she did another masters in like
C	oh
A	Shakespeare or something shit like that
B	they needed
A	mm
B	anyway
C	so this is in Paris?
B	yeah
A	near
B	so they they got
A	yeah
B	then they wanted they needed a head of
A	yeah
B	couldn't get that so they forged a signature
B	anyway
A	oh my god
B	they're now worried they've sent it off but they're worried because the guy in France said
A	oh no
B	and so it may well be she won't get the job
C	oh so she hasn't got there yet?
B	no no she's applied for it
C	oh well the way you were going on
A	yeah I thought you
B	well she
B	erm
C	has she never applied for a job in France?
A	how does she know she
B	no no no
A	but that he he gets it and it isn't his signature?
B	I know
A	god
B	mm
C	how stupid is that?
A	I know
C	but however there was er a a court case just thrown out this week there's been a major case
B	mm
A	yeah
C	who
A	mm?
C	and
A	shit
C	but the law
A	nobody actually
C	actually
A	but how is that legal? like that shouldn't be legal
C	and you think
B	and so Tesco's aren't guilty then?
C	well that's the point
A	shit
C	which is an amazing decision and
A	yeah
C	it just goes to show that however good parliament
B	well it's like these obscure when I worked for
A	mm
B	really did a tremendous amount of damage
C	yeah
B	so
C	yeah okay we know what it means
B	no no listen
B	or by domestic pets but not birds
A	that's stupid
B	so this guy went back
C	yeah whatever
B	whatever law
B	never been repealed
A	mm well we've been looking this week at we've
C	yes
B	mm?
A	we actually have the
B	mm
A	it gets repossessed on the fourteenth of December
C	oh
A	they're still making us pay that month even if it gets repossessed
C	and are they allowed to?
A	we don't know it depends if it's a binding contract
C	because your contract is with them as opposed to with
B	the landlord
A	it depends on it depends if it's a binding contract if the mortgage is a binding mortgage
C	oh
A	or something like that then yes we do have to pay if it's not
C	and how much deposit
A	four hundred and something each
C	so it's a month's rent?
A	yeah
B	but hang on if you pay if your contract's with the letting agent and
A	yeah
B	not with the landlord
A	yeah
B	then the letting agent have got your deposit under a protection scheme
C	yes we know yeah we know that
A	we do and we yeah we do and we have the thing to prove it like our deposit is safe
C	yeah
B	mm
A	but we still they're still gonna make us pay that last month's rent even though the landlord's gonna have the house repossessed
A	and we're like but we're not in the house and they're like we don't care
C	well that's a bit wrong isn't it?
A	yeah
C	that's not very nice I might appeal on that one
B	I would
A	well yeah we're trying to but they won't they won't budge they're saying
B	is there any rugby on tonight?
C	I've no idea
A	mm
C	why would there be rugby on tonight?
B	cos it's European
C	what rugby?
B	yeah
C	it's Tuesday
A	yeah
C	Wednesday
A	it's Wednesday today
B	oh is it? oh blimey I thought it was Friday
A	what day did you think it was?
B	I was thinking it was Friday cos
C	Jonah Lomu died
A	I'm not I'm going back home
C	Jonah Lomu died
A	yeah I know kidney failure
B	yeah I know
C	kidney failure? he's only
B	thought he died of a heart attack didn't he?
A	no he didn't he had kidney failure problems with his kidneys
B	yes
C	oh not
B	he died of a heart attack
C	he's only forty
A	mm
B	I know
A	yeah cos he had to have a kidney transplant didn't he?
C	they're claiming he was up there with Tiger Woods and
A	yeah there was a stupid erm
C	they all ran out the way
A	yeah
C	they all leapt
A	he was massive
C	they all leapt out the way
A	and just
C	he was huge
A	he was like eighteen stone apparently
C	and then
A	yeah yeah yeah
C	that's a
A	then at the time yeah
C	that's yeah that's a difference and then
A	yeah I can imagine
A	ah
C	it was a tremendous game it was
A	yeah
C	up
C	England would never have been able to turn over the All Blacks the French
A	no
C	just went for them
A	yeah but then this time they rolled over
C	they rolled over they were pathetic weren't they?
A	mm
C	and I don't think that I
A	yeah
C	like
A	mm
C	this lot just go back and
A	no
A	in the rugby in the UK isn't good enough the team isn't good enough Lancaster stepped down though didn't he?
C	well yeah he was forced to wasn't he?
A	I think he had to
C	but then the danger they've got is that
A	I wanna cup of tea if you're making one
B	I'm not making a cup of tea
A	can you make a cup of tea?
B	I will do yes
C	Woodward went through the
A	yeah Lancaster hadn't
A	mm
C	if you had the
A	I know I agree it was naïve to expect him to win or do er very well in the world cup but it wasn't naïve to expect him to win or do something when in the Six Nations and he didn't do anything in the Six Nations
C	the
A	yeah
C	yeah and they didn't
A	agreed
C	he he was too committed to some players

A	yeah
C	won
A	no
C	North is just never gonna come the
A	yeah
C	and he certainly won't do it now
A	but the same as
C	yeah
A	had so much potential then he moved to Saracens and then he absolutely achieved nothing
C	well yeah but he's he's won
A	Ashton's gone
C	he's won things that he didn't win at Saints
A	oh yeah true
C	so so that but no he's he's
B	yeah but he's won them later than he would've won at the Saints if he'd've stayed
C	well no he would've won it later cos Saracens
A	beat the Saints yeah
A	Saints did
