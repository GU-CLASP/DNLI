A	er that's right
B	oh the fire is nice
A	that fire is lovely
B	it's chillier outside than you think actually
A	it's what?
B	look there's the bus again
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	otherwise it would have just rang three times like
A	yeah
B	that's the only reason it got picked up because otherwise it would have just kept going on to answer machine and they would never have found it underneath the seat or whatever they found it
A	yeah
B	they must have found it on the back of the bus and run it up to the bus driver cos she was still driving
A	yeah
B	well she wasn't still driving she was paused at a roundabout or something
A	well it was nice they gave it then cos
B	I don't understand how I dropped it in the first place
A	no
B	yeah
A	hmm
B	I'll just put that there
A	so did you have a nice time with
B	yeah we walked the dogs around the
A	mm mm
B	around the
A	right
B	and you go through the
A	right
B	but of course that's the way I went when I went to school
A	did he? Is he not very er? He's not very trained
B	no
A	he comes back with a pheasant doesn't he?
B	well no he started chasing rabbits because we went past this field and there was there was just rabbits running about everywhere and then he started running miles away
A	oh no
B	and
B	I don't know why
A	well
B	but last time they went for a walk they went for a walk and she ended up phoning erm
A	mm
B	to come and help her get him because he'd literally gone in these woods
A	what he just legs it does he?
B	and it wouldn't come wouldn't come back
A	our dog used to do that
B	yeah
A	and he would he would like jump at the bike and
B	oh that's not nice
A	it was horrible
B	and then you have to just walk about with your plastic bags
A	well this is in the nineties
B	oh that's horrible
A	so I just had to kind of leave it
B	no
A	and if someone was
B	oh no
A	and if someone saw you the looks she gave
B	quite rightly you don't want that on your door step
A	yeah
B	he's only young
A	I mean you
B	she was talking today about putting him towards some more training
A	but but because they found him though was a stray dog wasn't he?
B	yeah but he was a puppy
A	yeah but no they're the dogs we got as well but because they'd had a a bad upbringing
B	but it was he was little
A	yeah exactly
B	yeah
A	they're not
B	you'd have thought if they had been abandoned though they'd want to cling to their new owners quite well and not leave them
A	yeah yeah
B	it's his breed as well
A	yeah
B	I mean he's a hunting dog really
A	hmm
B	but hunting dogs get trained so that should be should be possible I don't know
A	yeah yeah you need to know what you're doing don't you
B	I think they should take him to a school
A	we tried that with our dog and he was just useless man
B	some dogs you just can't can you
A	but also like our house because I don't know it was a bit of mess really
B	hmm
A	because it was a bit of a dysfunctional kind of environment for him
B	the thing is with with both both of
A	mm
B	so er when
A	mm
B	like every night
A	yeah I've had the same thing
B	I just think no no
A	yeah he did used to come up on the bed though
B	well there you go
A	yeah and he'd have his tail between his legs
B	and
A	no  you can't  you can't teach an old dog new tricks
B	mm
A	you can't you have to  you have to  really put it in them when they're young
B	yeah
A	he's a nice dog though
B	yeah but can you imagine every night having the dog on the bottom of your bed?
A	no I wouldn't want that
B	and then
A	yeah
B	it's bad habits like what are they going to do when they've got kids? They'll have the kids in the bed and the dog in the bed and urgh
A	mm
B	oh they were talking more about caravans today
A	were they?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	but I was saying now I think I think they changed the law so you've got to have planning permission for a static house now as well
A	really?
B	think so
A	you need planning
B	yeah I think so
A	it depends on the dimensions
B	mm
A	when a shed becomes a house
B	well that's the
A	but you you've got these little sites though with the erm with the temporary homes on them
B	yeah but I think those temporary homes
A	do they have
B	no they're not attached
A	do you?
B	oh I don't know but she's got all these romantic ideas about what to do and I don't
A	no she's got a great well they've they've both got great ideas
B	they are good ideas
A	they are yeah
B	I mean
A	mm
B	well that's those types or the other type of site isn't the type of site they really want to go on because they're a bit rough
A	well yeah they
B	yeah
A	especially at the moment
B	cheap accommodation sites
A	people who want to buy just a temporary residence or a
B	yeah but like in a nice
A	yeah
B	but how how would you
A	well you'd have to buy
B	how would you test people on saying that whether they're nice enough or not? You can't can you? How do you test people in saying they're nice enough?
A	no but you just need to market it a way that suggests that
B	mm
A	if you buy a bit of land and try and target the people that you'd like to live on it
B	but I think you probably have to have planning permission
A	what to turn it into a site? Yeah you would
B	yeah
A	hmm
B	but yeah you target people like them and like us who who yeah can't afford a house or don't want to go into the mortgage just yet and just want to live together in a community but not in a commune
A	I think that's the way forward though
B	yeah
A	I don't think
B	mm
A	like in France they don't buy their houses they they only erm they they only rent them
B	what?
A	yeah
B	well some people must buy them
A	but a lot of countries they don't actually buy their houses like they do in this country
B	well what do they do in France? Just rent?
A	yeah
B	well who owns the land?
A	I don't know but who who does own the land anyway?
B	that's what
A	mm
B	and I was saying Rob ultimately the queen owns all of the land and he was saying  he was saying  once this scheme is into place ultimately that company this new company would own the land
A	yeah
B	and I was thinking what was the point of that? I don't
A	hmm
B	he he's got really caught up in all of that because it's a new age idea or something
A	yeah
B	and it's trying to get away from the big companies and the big
A	yeah
B	so you can't get around stuff like that because even if it starts off having good intentions as soon as the money comes in people turn companies turn
A	mm
B	they get their big zombie eyes and start looking at those numbers going up in the bank and
A	yeah
B	and start thinking oh we own all this land now
A	yeah
B	and like might have starts it might start with good intentions but I don't believe that
A	yeah but is it not worth getting in on something that's starting with good intentions and then moving on later?
B	well no I'd rather have my own land thanks
A	yeah but how do you have your own land? Like really
B	you buy it
A	what either you buy it like outright
B	see also they think right
A	mm
B	exactly and they say they say you just keep it on the quiet
A	well that's very well
B	very well
A	saying that
B	no it won't work
A	yeah
B	well I don't know that's according to my
A	well
B	well
A	well no but but they looked into all that when they built their house so I mean they do know quite a lot about that kind of thing
B	hmm
A	even though that was what twenty thirty years ago
B	twenty
A	twenty years ago
B	mm
A	but I think it it is a brilliant thing to do and I've got a respect for them doing that
B	hmm
A	I mean god that Homes
B	I quite like
A	every person on there
B	yeah
A	that just
B	yeah it's not nice is it? It's just like them buying more and more and more
A	like there's just this huge divide being driven this huge wedge being driven in this country between land owners and those who do not own land
B	mm
A	and that it's all very well if you if you've got some kind of property fine you're laughing
B	mm
A	but if you haven't like us you're screwed
B	yeah that does get me as well
A	yeah
B	Cos
A	even though that would be abused because people who earn loads of property would just put the other
B	yeah yeah they do that
A	yeah
B	but I don't think people should be allowed that business to be honest
A	it is really
B	yeah but that should be enough business
A	yeah but once you start saying that kind of thing though then you're kind of limiting progress aren't you
B	no I think there should be a limit
A	in that sense but you have to apply that across the board
B	mm
A	it's
B	I'd like to buy some land
A	I'd love to
B	that's cos you don't want the mortgage at all
A	yeah no I'd have to buy it outright
B	yeah but you can't
A	well anything's possible
B	it's not possible
A	yeah it is
B	mm
A	how much a house cost now to how much it did cost
B	what were you doing on the computer?
A	I don't know I I I got the housing prices over like twenty years and then I looked at the interest rates and the inflation and put that into the house prices and they're still way way way over priced
B	oh yeah yeah
A	yeah because because they've come down
B	the mortgages might be low but the house prices aren't
A	yeah
B	mm
A	that's just to tempt people in
B	yeah? Well they are still too high
A	they're not
B	they're high
A	what a hundred and sixty grand for a just a some really you know really tiny terraced house with no garden
B	yeah for a rubbish
A	no
B	no it's terrible
A	mm
B	I'm really against buying a flat
A	yeah
B	how do people want to buy? Remember those people that we met? Who were they who was? Who was that who was erm buying some flat in some Eastern European country?
A	yeah that was in Bulgaria
B	and they had never been there
A	yeah
B	and  they were just  they were just watching it on the internet being built
A	yeah yeah
B	mm
A	so it's
B	mm
A	but
B	yeah you could make some money I suppose
A	yeah
B	that's another thing
A	what in erm?
B	shares
A	waterhouse
B	yeah
A	erm yeah because in April they said if you haven't got five thousand something or other in the erm account you're going to get charged some administration fee
B	we need to work out
A	well either we put
B	really?
A	or we can just take it out and pay the fifty pound withdrawal fine
B	but we haven't even used it
A	I know but I thought it would have crashed before
B	yeah
A	erm but I you know I I still really believe that it's going to the markets going to crash at least this year
B	well me too but we've got to be careful with that
A	well it's not doing much is it?
B	no it's just sitting there
A	yeah but if it was in a bank it wouldn't be doing much more with the zero point zero one percent interest
B	no it would still be sitting there but the thing is we're not
A	yeah I know what you mean
B	yeah
A	or withdraw it
B	I would like to
A	you want to gamble it or? Because it is a gamble basically
B	we've got to really look and
A	but it's a gamble based on a bit of knowledge
B	yeah but if you put all that money into something then that won't be included in the five thousand pounds that you need to have the
A	yeah it will
B	it will?
A	yeah you have to have five thousand or so in your portfolio
B	oh
A	mm
B	you know they want independence and everything?
A	mm
B	Scotland are
A	mm
B	tin and copper tin and copper erm I think it was tin and copper
A	mm mm
B	and there was a gold mine as well
A	yeah
B	and I don't know it was just like why did you know why were they asking for independence now? Is it because they found loads of gold?
B	I don't know
A	they wouldn't be able to keep that a secret
B	oh they would if they wanted to
A	they wouldn't
B	well if it's a possibility isn't it?
A	but I know the tin mines are reopening in Cornwall
B	yeah
A	because the tin price has gone right up
B	mm
A	I think the gold mines yeah there were some in Scotland wasn't there?
B	mm
A	and Wales
B	and they're opening them up
A	yeah there was this guy
B	no because I didn't watch it with you
A	there was a guy  on the  on the stream
B	yeah but I didn't watch that with you
A	oh okay
B	really?
A	he was there with the old erm the sieve
B	yeah
A	like sifting away the gold
B	yeah he was collecting his only little pieces
A	and that was his own project
B	freeze
A	but he'd made quite a bit I think
B	yeah
A	which is why I think
B	I was just wondering why you know why do they want? I don't know
A	mm
B	I can't think of any reason why they want to separate from us really
A	well I don't know
B	I think they get quite good benefits from being with us
A	I think they've got a very good deal actually from being part of the UK
B	yeah from being part of the UK
A	they've got free education
B	I don't know
A	they've got a lot more than we do
B	no
B	yeah
A	well I
B	because then it's kind of investing close to home and it's not
A	I know some of the UK mining companies
B	yeah?
A	yeah I wrote them down somewhere
B	so we'll have a look at them
A	yeah?
B	yeah why not?
A	yeah cos when you're investing in gold you need to look at the politics of a country to see how stable it is
B	yeah
A	the safety of their mining operations
B	and they are very safe
A	yeah well yeah Europe would be okay
B	oh do you know what was on the news today?
A	what?
B	Brazil
A	gDP?
B	gDP
A	yeah
B	and Brazil have like really taken off in their economy
A	oh okay
B	and  they were  they were  they were going to do  they were going to do a big thing about it today actually
A	mm
B	oranges
A	belly dancers?
B	no
A	manufacturing is our biggest export
B	that's what they said on the BBC news
A	and what manufacturing is that then?
B	I don't know
A	manufacturing
B	it was manufacturing and administration or something like that
A	yeah
B	yeah financial
A	well they never do
B	yeah but you know Brazil are exporting oranges and they're doing better than us
A	well look at the size of Brazil
B	yeah
A	yeah but the resources they have
B	and their job
A	yeah
B	mm
A	because we've still got all our finance
B	yeah
A	and they're basically just that's where we get most of out money from
B	mm
A	is because we're fucking other countries over
B	no
A	but it's not
B	Jamaica want to separate
A	yeah
B	is it Argentina that owned the Falklands?
A	yeah yeah yeah yeah
B	yeah they wanted them back but now Jamaica want to separate from us and they were going oh
A	yeah
B	he looks really beady eyed
A	he is
B	he looks like a lizard
A	yeah
B	with his beady eyes
A	yeah
B	erm but anyway what was I saying? They erm yeah he's over there trying to strengthen our relations but god knows how he's going to do that
A	strengthen our relations
B	no he's trying to save it because no but Jamaica was saying oh well we'll separate from you but  we do  we do like having your support so we'll still treat the Queen as exactly the same
A	yeah
B	no
A	yeah
B	but seriously I mean so if they separate from us
A	yeah well that's over that's with them over a barrel with a gun to their head
B	if they separate from us what's? Like everybody's separating from us
A	everyone's splitting up
B	yeah
A	it it's quite interesting actually
B	mm
A	but a good thing at the moment is there seems to be a trend that countries are actually separating up into smaller groups and things are getting small and
B	yeah
A	well yeah evolving
B	but it's not devolution in my eyes
A	no no but it's a negative word given for that purpose
B	mm
A	but like Belgium has split in two hasn't it
B	yeah yeah
A	and I think this is going to be a
B	Sudan just split in two
A	yeah
B	do you remember when we were in China?
A	yeah exactly
B	and they they had that north south east west divide didn't they?
A	they had a huge divide
B	they were all just slagging each other off
A	they hated each other
B	yeah
A	and you think China is just this big Communist kind of mass of working together as
B	mm
A	and that that's you know that's a huge problem
B	really? I don't know it seems
A	which I think is good
B	I don't I can't predict anything at the moment it all seems really here and there
A	mm
B	mm
A	but I never really thought India because they've got so many religions and so many distinct variations in their country that
B	they almost always have to stay together because of their differences don't they?
A	I mean they've they've got eight hundred and fifty odd languages
B	yeah I know but they can't separate into little tribes
A	well yeah but they
B	mm
A	in another way not
B	yeah
A	and I remember in erm Darjeeling you've got the whole Gorkhaland
B	oh god
A	they're trying to get independence going on strikes
B	yeah independence
A	I mean and that was
B	we never went there did we? Never got there
A	no no but you've got so many
B	yeah well you've got
A	just the mentality is completely different
B	and because you've got so many Tibetans living there as well all changing the communities
A	yeah and you've got that
B	mm
A	and then you've got yeah down by Sri Lanka and then you've ah
B	yeah but isn't that what they they love their diversity there?
A	yeah and so they should but it's not a great recipe for economic dominance
B	mm
A	er yeah in a minute
B	yeah?
A	yeah I spoke to my brother last night
B	oh yeah what did he say?
A	erm yeah he's just working
B	mm
A	hmm
B	what he
A	yeah well he's
B	well I suppose you can
A	because he's desperate to play cos I think he's realising that like I said
B	he's getting on a bit
A	yeah yeah
B	yeah
A	and that's probably the end of his career really
B	mm
A	and he has he still has to go work where he's lifting heavy weights all day
B	yeah
A	he can't say ph my leg's hurting and I won't I'm not I can't lift that because they'll just rip the piss out of him
B	I just realised the time so I'm going to text mum and dad
A	okay
B	yeah
A	erm yeah but he's doing alright but then I was asking how
B	God she's sort they're in a state
A	I don't know but he was saying that she has to spend some days just lying in bed because she can't move
B	she keeps trying to
A	yeah she keeps trying to
B	why?
A	when really she needs to give up skating completely
B	yeah
A	because every time she does one of those arches it's literally tearing the bone apart in her spine
B	yeah
A	erm yeah I'm just going to go to the toilet
B	sorry I've got to do this
