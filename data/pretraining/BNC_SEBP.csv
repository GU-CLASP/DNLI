B	yay
A	so why don't you fucking do it then you set of cunts?
D	so the police don't like what they're doing?
C	they do and they don't so they can never they can't prosecute them for full
C	they can't do them for grooming they do them for intent for grooming because something
A	but the thing is they get put on the sex offenders register then and then people can know they're in the area
D	so disgusted that this even happens
A	oh yeah I know
C	well it was a nine-year-old girl she would have been raped there wouldn't she?
A	disabled as well
B	yeah
A	she would have been raped
B	he could have easily killed her
D	bless you
A	can you pass me
C	is that the guy that catches them?
A	mm
D	what's he saying?
A	the state of that house
A	imagine if your dad were on this or summat?
C	yeah
B	yeah oh my god
D	who is she talking about?
B	the
A	ah
D	for mainly for you though
A	what a fucking what the fuck?
C	I'm glad they don't like force him or beat him up
B	yeah
A	ah yeah
A	they stay within the law don't they?
D	if they
A	the thing is though like he is to blame for this he shouldn't be putting it on the fucking internet
D	I actually agree with her
A	yeah I do
B	mm
D	yeah but do you want that guy around her?
B	rather no dad than a paedophile dad
D	yeah same
A	yeah but the thing is if
D	yeah but it is the
B	no I'm not saying that but if I was growing up knowing that my dad was a paedophile I couldn't live with that
D	I wouldn't want
A	it's a mental illness though innit? like you can't just turn round and say like I they're gonna be the same forever or
D	no but you can turn around and say you don't want contact with your paedophile dad
A	yeah no but like they don't have that choice any more
D	sometimes you don't need to I've heard stories about mine and it's like
B	true though yeah
D	it's the people that care about you that are still there and I'm not saying he didn't care about them but
A	no I know but it's gonna fuck them kids up the fact that their dad killed
B	and they'll never get to ask why or like get closure
A	exactly they'll never get any closure they'll just get
B	yeah had it not been made so public he might not have
A	mm
D	exactly
A	well these people should get help like when you're going to prison for grooming or being a paedophile or any of that you should get psychiatrical help
B	did you watch the erm Louis Theroux programme? he does the documentaries on all the
A	yeah
B	and erm he did one in a paedophile detention centre in America at some
A	it's disgusting
B	it's like what are you teaching them? teaching them that by being a paedophile they can come here and live well for the rest of their lives
D	true
B	and be groomed to then go back into community because they got let out afterwards
A	they should get help they should
B	it's shocking
A	like there were there were a documentary once about erm these paedophiles and basically they had a problem so they got castrated
B	yeah
A	so they just castrated themselves so they never did anything or could act on it
A	mm
B	was telling me that she was erm reading a case and it was part of the evidence was like this group on Facebook and it was for people who had
A	mm
B	and it was like a closed group of people who could talk about it and like none of them ever acted on it but it was like their own like little support sort of group
C	they did that online?
B	yeah
C	why the fuck would you do that?
A	yeah
B	I I know but
A	you could create a face Facebook profile wouldn't you and just use that and be a part of that group with that
B	or just meet up in person I don't know like
A	yeah
A	no but like
B	let's go get a coffee yeah?
A	no but like
A	you can hide behind a computer screen and have a Facebook group
B	yeah no no yeah that's
A	cos it is a psychological problem
A	erm
C	the five's more powerful apparently
A	yeah
C	high more high spec
A	yeah five C's cheaper
B	is it?
A	yeah it's just plastic
B	I always thought that it was like more expensive
A	no
D	so what's the difference between five and five S?
A	erm five S? the five S has got the erm touch so you put your
D	yeah is that it?
A	that's it
C	pretty much
A	that's basically it
A	it is the
B	I I think the cameras are really good
A	yeah
B	yeah cos some of them are more like orientated around that aren't they?
A	like Windows' phones cos the
B	yeah
A	software's shit they have to give you a good camera whereas Iphones the software's fantastic so they're not bothered about cameras cos people still buy Iphones
B	my dad when my contract runs out he'll get erm the upgrade he really wants to have that one and I was like no
A	yeah but he could upgrade to an Iphone five
B	I think if it came to it whatever I probably would just
A	yeah the only difference is the touchpad so that's it
B	but
A	I'm just gonna go and get a glass of milk
B	alright
A	but yeah I
B	no I really don't either
A	it's
B	cos it's not their fault
A	no
B	you can live your entire life with a person and not know them
A	yeah
B	like him committing suicide?
A	it's dangerous for the family
B	if
A	the thing is he can never be brought to justice now cos he's dead
B	no but
A	yeah
B	they can do what they want but he probably wouldn't have done that
A	yeah he knew that what he were doing were wrong
B	but like it's it's not
A	just arrest them
B	the things that cost money and time and that the police can't do have the police there and they can arrest them there and then
A	but the thing is Stinson can't do it if he doesn't put it on the internet cos people won't give him money for it
B	mm
A	cos the thing is as well
B	I agree with what he's doing
A	like all of them will be on benefits
B	yeah
A	every single one of them people who were part of Stinson's team will be on benefits
B	but like I really do agree with what he's doing I mean dedicating his life to fighting crime after being
A	yeah I agree with it yeah
B	like that is great redemption but the fact of the matter is
A	it's the way he's going about it that's wrong
B	yeah and like it's not illegal but it's I don't think right
A	I agree with what he's doing
B	like you don't have to put online and ruin not only that person's life but
A	everyone attached to them
B	cos like like like I was saying like I would not be able to live with it if ever I found out that my dad was a
A	no
B	no ignorance is
A	mm
B	like as long as he was taken to justice or whatever I wouldn't want to have anything to do with it
A	yeah
B	and I wouldn't want to be affiliated and be known as the paedophile's daughter
A	mm
A	and like everyone sees it on Facebook oh like your dad's a paedo and their life is now a misery because of what the dad's done
B	exactly
A	yeah
B	so like oh your dad's a paedophile so you're going to grow up to be one it's like that's not how it works
A	yeah
B	I think it's quite despicable
A	it is because yeah what they've done is wrong and yeah they do deserve to be named and shamed but when they've been in court
B	yeah
A	then it's up to the police and the press to to do that
B	yeah and like okay the police don't always have the time and the resources to do it but the law enforcement is there for a reason they're the ones that are trained and know how to deal with it correctly
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	like and we're going to show you how
B	or work for us
A	yeah we're going to show you how to do it properly
B	yeah
A	no
B	mm
A	yeah
B	they then become a criminal
A	eye for an eye makes the whole world blind
B	exactly
A	me too
B	may I please have a little sip of your milk?
A	yeah
B	oh you found one as well?
A	well actually it's five leaves I don't even know if it's a clover but I'm going to say it's a clover
B	I don't think that that's not a clover
A	oh no don't say that
B	you'll find one
B	although it's all shrivelled up and gone weird
A	yeah but you should have put it in between a book
B	I did
A	it presses it it keeps it erm
B	yeah put it inside
A	yeah just leave it like that it'll
B	it's all shrivelled and weird
A	mm
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	you've got more fucking common sense than that
A	can you hear the stadium?
B	yeah
A	match going on
B	I was wondering what it was when I heard the dramatic
A	I don't know what is going on
A	what's this?
C	look at you
D	that was
A	oh yeah
B	shit
A	oh I want to get him out again

B	ah
D	ah

A	ah
D	that is too much love that is too much love for your dogs
B	she thought it was like
D	really?
B	yeah like she genuinely believed that her dogs liked it enough to
A	see that woman who married a rollercoaster?
B	mm
A	that woman who married a rollercoaster
A	yeah
D	really?
A	yeah
A	I don't understand how he gets all the money for all this equipment
B	what is he saying?
A	ah I remember this guy
D	why's it such a big deal?
A	he's he's a teacher
D	why would it be for
B	I guess if they weren't actually prosecuted
A	yeah if they were prosecuted then it'd be for nothing
B	what the teacher?
D	any of them
A	what he's on trial himself?
C	mm
A	he's got fucking issues serious issues he's got to see a psychiatrist
C	he was fingered as a kid wasn't he?
A	yeah
D	he was what?
A	fingered as a kid
C	well
A	that is exactly what he is doing
D	yeah but erm
B	basically saying that
D	what?
C	well he's prevented at least ten girls being raped there ain't he?
A	yeah
B	basically he was
A	well the evidence that he gets a suspended sentence what does suspended sentence mean? does anyone know?
C	yeah
D	yeah it means they don't go to jail right now
C	they don't go to jail
A	so they get

C	need to get
