A	the curry sauce is good
B	yeah it is
A	mm mm
A	mm
B	yeah and I've had that belt since I was seventeen
A	oh my god
B	seventeen
A	mm
B	yeah clearly the answer
A	mm
B	my next step which obviously won't probably be this year but you know it's alright
A	mm
B	is my aim is to wear a bikini
A	mm
B	never
A	but you wear a trikini
B	well yeah there isn't much to that
A	yeah
B	but that is the most naked thing I've ever owned
A	right
B	swimwear wise
A	yeah I mean absolutely hate it but I don't know
B	mm
A	if I'm  if I'm  in beach wear it's because I'm on the beach and in which case I want to get a brown tummy
B	yeah
A	but only because I want to lie somewhere
B	mm
A	mm
B	army boot camp
A	mm
B	mm
A	ooh
B	naked holiday basically yeah
A	you're going to do an eighteen to thirties holiday?
B	yes
A	right
B	and it all sounds very good in my head and hilarious fun with loads of teenage boys
A	you're going to want to kill everybody
B	all the screaming girls
A	mm
B	but erm
A	mm
B	in Greece and he said well you can still do those types of holidays at those resorts but not with eighteen thirties
A	eighteen year olds
B	so there are places that are set up for that holiday but they don't specify themselves under the eighteen thirties bracket so they don't
A	mm
B	they get young people but most young people will go to the brochure club travel agent place and ask for eighteen thirties
A	mm
B	yep
A	but I think in reality you would probably kill everybody
B	yes and you'd be knackered
A	mm
B	absolutely whacked all the time
A	mm
B	all the time
A	it's like my friend became an air steward
B	oh
A	mm mm
B	no
A	it's really bad like going to the toilets to be sick on a plane and then having to serve food and drink to people
B	well no I couldn't be arsed with that
A	no no no
B	just the thought of being trapped in a plane for that long
A	mm mm
B	it makes me get snotty because I'm allergic to the air con
A	yeah
B	like no
A	I get a really bad
B	yeah
A	but I get a banging banging headache
B	sinus capsules sometimes help that
A	mm
B	but no I just couldn't imagine
A	but being up in the air
B	yeah
A	no
B	mm mm
A	the risk of death
B	I couldn't couldn't do that
A	no no no
B	ah
A	mm
B	not me
A	mm
B	erm something about making her a a cum bucket or a
A	what?
B	yeah I think I need to get Lazza
A	what?
B	yeah I have to read it to you it's shocking
A	ah cos it's got a little personality
B	yeah
A	ah
B	mm
A	no
B	er
A	does it make you feel sick?
B	it is it's very gross
A	mm mm
A	huh
B	oh I'm just going to have to
A	nom nom nom
A	mm
A	oh gross
B	see mate
A	oh god
B	and then someone says  what's the  what's the wrongun? And he goes tradesman's entrance
A	as if you couldn't work that out
B	yeah
A	home wrecker? That's a bit weird
B	yeah
A	Jesus Christ
B	so we all have a high opinion of wrens then lol
A	erm why join the navy?
B	someone wrote they make me sick and then you are such a nob
A	he is such a nob
B	I mean he never wrote they make me sick
A	no but he wrote the spunk bucket
B	yeah he did
A	so this isn't the girl that's got all the kids is it?
B	no no no
A	if that was me I would go fucking ape shit
B	yeah
A	what the hell is the matter with him? Well that's probably what you're going to have to get used to
B	I know
A	Mate
B	yeah
A	yeah but it's not until it's confronted
B	yeah
A	no
B	like getting them fired
A	well in theory
B	yeah I think  from what  from what my Michael's saying which is why he didn't want me to go in as an officer is so you know I don't think you'll have so much fun cos you know people won't be able to have a laugh and banter with you like they can with each other cos they're really not allowed
A	erm
B	yeah and I'm thinking yeah that's a good thing thanks
A	mm
B	which I can see where he's coming from
A	mm
B	yeah but I'm thinking twenty-five erm that I would have probably found that amusing for about three weeks and then want to die
A	yeah and then you've got four years
B	yeah
A	mm
B	I suppose that's one good thing at least they won't actually be able to say it to my face
A	mm
B	mm
A	it's going to be like school though isn't it
B	yeah it's definitely going to be like school
A	I literally couldn't imagine anything worse
B	it's going to be like  it's going to be like  school
A	mm
B	I think
A	and I wouldn't go back to school
B	I thought school was great
A	hmm
B	well then maybe you'll get on fantastically
A	do you need a second sitting?
B	yeah I need to have a rest
A	to be honest I'm more concerned about cos my friends at school were all boys so I was used to be around that type of yak language
B	mm
A	but they all knew not not to go there with me erm but I'd I'd join in and I'd give it as good as I got but they would never they'd never cross the line seeming as they called me Miss Manners they knew that there was certain things like say bad as that wouldn't get that bad
B	mm
A	erm my problem my my worry is that maybe when I'm there I might get carried away in joining in and taking the piss out of them and then I'll get in trouble
B	mm
A	for being too familiar with them which is a bit of a
B	yeah
A	no
B	mm
A	but I suppose when you're there and there's other people that are officers to learn from that have already done that position for ages you'll know what type of behaviour to adopt won't you
B	yeah
A	mm
B	mm
A	whereas I won't be able to go home and be silly
B	you might have an officers' mess on the boat where you can just be
A	yeah that's alright
B	because you'd have to have some sort of outlet wouldn't you
A	yeah I couldn't keep me silly contained for all that time
B	you'd just be like guy
A	what? What?
B	an American was it off an army base? An American soldier walked off an army base and shot sixteen civilians
A	shut up
B	yeah they said oh he's had a breakdown
A	when was that?

A	I think she's probably milking it for some reason
A	gone in the wild
B	oh you're hurting me leg
A	oh that's quite a good er little rest isn't it
B	oh I just happened to be there
A	oh

A	oh what could it be? Maybe it was a milk product
B	I don't  I don't  know but it's bad times

B	one and only time
A	erm fabreze it
B	I can smell it now
A	so what is it now on the top or on the bottom?
B	and it's on the top because you can't flip it over?

A	Cos I was like does she mean it's a film

B	and they
A	bloody hell
B	on time every time
A	oh I'm so jealous
B	yeah they were really good

B	no
A	berties not hanging out in there is he?
B	no
A	he's running away from you
B	oh do you think

B	oh yeah
A	oh man
B	that was some scary times
A	I thought the zombies were going to come in
B	yes
A	they probably do all kind of testing around here
B	yep
A	on people's brains
B	yes I looked out of the kitchen window this morning
A	the kitchen window
B	to notice that just outside my on my window frame at the top is a peg
A	oh
B	A blue peg

A	erm
B	erm
A	crazy horse

A	rank
B	yeah
A	and
B	no
A	is he twelve years old?
B	yes in short
A	what the hell? I mean who does that? So you've been pegged

A	erm he's really famous now
B	if this is who I think it is he's actually really famous now and you'll be kicking
A	well I probably do need kicking
B	right
A	so I probably do need some sort of erm lesson in modern modern culture
B	you've probably got issues
A	I might need to start reading you know
B	I hate that type of stuff
A	well that's my problem
B	yeah
A	that
B	I'm so glad you said that cos I went into Mango and tried on a a dress in a large and there was no way I was getting in it
A	it's disgusting
B	ah right
A	in in mental Mango world a large is twelve
B	Cos I usually think a large is a fourteen and an extra large is a sixteen
A	yeah
B	that's what I would go for
A	well in European sizes I suppose it is cos they're all quite petite
B	you're large
A	so no wonder girls have got eating disorders
B	yeah that's
B	it's it's so responsible isn't it
A	I can't believe that
B	A twelve is a large
A	I mean you can fuck off
B	yeah

B	and I'm such a bad bed maker
A	yeah
B	no it hasn't has it
A	why don't you just spread it out and do it later when you can actually be able to
B	yeah I think that's the plan
A	erm the thing is though
B	I suppose they don't really know what they've got their work cut out for with me do they
A	well no
A	Dearie me
B	right
A	mm
B	all done now
A	do you know what?
B	no
A	run around in their pants
