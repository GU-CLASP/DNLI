A	I know
B	mm
A	but I mean
B	well
A	yeah
B	not even her mum
A	no well I I think
B	mm
A	there's erm it's not like they've got this great bond with their mum even though they've they have in a way because they're around there and they're very
B	mm
A	clannish like that but
B	mm
A	in another way they don't
B	mm
A	erm even though they're different from like
B	mm
A	I love you and you're brilliant
B	mm
A	and that kind of thing
B	mm mm
A	but
B	yeah and was with her boyfriend
A	well she'd er
B	erm
A	said she
B	uhu
A	I said to her you might not wanna talk to me but erm
B	mm
A	she was just she looked at me as if I was mad
B	mm mm
A	and I know that I know that a lot of kids feel a bit like that about their parents but there was no erm
B	no mm
A	it's like she would she would go to her about some things and there's er
B	mm
A	she's not bonded
B	mm
A	with her mum but she's
B	mm
A	it's
B	she did
B	well yes yes yes and everything seemed to be erm well you know er accepted in a rush
A	oh yeah
B	but I would have been
A	mm
B	erm I think that shows us something
A	mm
B	erm but
A	no
B	cos they wouldn't have done they wouldn't have done they would not have thrown her out or never see her again
A	no
B	or anything like this you know?
A	oh no I I really don't think it's that
B	erm I think it was just because for some reason she got the hump with people
A	yeah
A	absolutely
B	you know?
A	she got the hump
B	er erm
A	she
B	as simple as that
A	yeah
B	and just decided not to to tell them
A	yeah
B	I'm not telling you what's happening to me
A	yeah
B	cos you know
A	yeah
B	you've introduced this new lady into my house and I don't you know I
A	yeah or you did this
B	mm mm
A	and you did that
B	mm
A	and whatever
B	mm mm
A	yeah
B	mm
A	and she insisted on coming to move here I think when her mum didn't want her for example and that kind of thing and then when she moved here she got away with loads more because it had been this
B	mm that's right
A	and she knew she knew very early on how to kind of pull those levers and that kind of thing
B	mm mm
A	yeah there's some there's undercurrents
B	mm
A	yeah
B	absolutely
B	and there's a lot of humps
A	and there's a lot of humps
B	you know and I
A	yeah
B	don't quite understand that
A	that's very true mum
B	erm
A	that's a nice way of looking at it
B	my
A	mm
B	talk about things I mean she was a much more social person et cetera
A	mm
B	than you know that we ever talked about
A	yeah
B	erm but she would she would have this face
A	yeah
B	and you knew that there was something wrong
A	yeah
B	and erm
A	it's a kind of small-minded spitefulness isn't it?
B	yes
A	a little bit off your mum
B	yes absolutely
A	and
B	erm and I'm sure that was the
A	yeah
B	it was the Irish side now that doesn't mean to say I mean
B	I love the Irish
A	just the Irish
A	you see I never get
B	er
A	like
B	mm
A	or
B	mm
A	I mean I bumped into
B	mm
A	his brother
B	mm
A	his other brother whom I'd never met at a
B	is this the one with five children?
A	yeah
B	right
A	and I know that he's been cross with
B	mm
A	just feels that they're too distant or
B	mm
A	they well
B	mm
A	they are
B	mm mm
A	they don't
B	no
A	even though they've
B	mm
A	erm
B	mm
A	his sisters
B	mm
A	so
B	mm
A	mum must be delighted
B	mm mm
A	you know but oh she is not
A	and she meant it she wasn't sort of joking
B	no
A	but it wasn't in a
B	hump way
A	yeah the the
B	yeah there's a difference between a hump
B	yeah
A	isn't there?
B	mm
A	there really is
B	mm yeah
A	and they all and that's what I definitely got from their mum as well and then there was
B	mm
A	er yeah this is a cause of
A	it's like
B	mm
A	memories and
B	no no
A	er er I think there's something about a lack of care there being able to do that so quickly isn't there with some people or lack of compassion or something
B	it's it's it is some er well normally you'd go
A	yeah
B	she couldn't be herself
A	yeah
B	she was one of eight she was the only girl who actually stayed at home
A	yeah
B	one was at the farm and
A	oh listen to him he's so sweet when he does er
A	doing the bear thing oh he's stopped now sorry carry on
A	carry on
B	he's talking to his blue bed is he? or
C	two big furry ears
A	two furry ears
C	two big goggly eyes
A	two goggly eyes
C	it's a bear
A	it's a bear quick
C	it's going woo woo
A	and then the way he goes you know we're going on a bear
B	oh right well yes yes yes
A	he loves that book and he's been he
B	oh wonderful wonderful
A	it's so sweet
B	er
A	that maybe the you're right maybe it is a
B	erm and
A	and childish er like other people are like
B	mm
A	cos
B	oh yeah no yeah oh er she
B	yes yes
A	and her mum does
B	yes
B	or her mum does well spectacular ones
A	yeah
B	erm I think it's
A	yeah
B	I think there was again it's not enough mothering
A	mm
B	for some reason or another erm at a crucial sort of bit because
A	yeah
A	mm
B	just can't go back she's too ill you know she's too frail so she she stayed on the farm and
A	yeah
B	when my granny was ill and looked after the house and never went back to school again
A	mm
B	erm but she was desperate for my granny's erm to and
A	mm
B	you know to sort of say oh you're wonderful but it was
A	yeah
B	it was how
A	yeah
B	erm nan oh poor nan up there you know we've got to
A	mm
B	look after nan cos she's got nothing up there
A	mm
B	and then you know erm and when they went to the convent oh yes great you know
A	yeah
B	erm and so and there was just my mum
A	mm
B	erm and we lived with my granny
A	mm
B	and we were away a year my granny came to live with us
A	mm
B	erm and I mean
A	yeah
B	when my father got a job in
A	yeah
B	my mother said I can't leave my mother
A	yeah
B	she needs me
A	oh god
B	so he left they were split up for about six months
A	wow
B	erm that was and there was like the three of us
A	yeah
B	erm and then because it wasn't my mother would have been shamed into going to
A	yeah
B	you know can't just not go and join your husband
A	mm
B	erm but that kind of thing
A	yeah
B	you know it's erm erm she was so and yes my granny was I'm sure quite quite a demanding lady very nicely
A	mm
B	very much in the highland way where you
A	mm
B	you know we don't ask very much you know
B	but you put that kind of moral pressure
A	yeah
B	on your kids and erm
A	yeah
B	but that's erm
A	yeah pressure could be put on in all sorts of ways
B	that's right
A	you don't have to explicitly say
B	that's right
A	yeah
B	sort of thing that people for and
A	mm
B	I'm not saying that but erm but somehow or another at a crucial stage of their of say
A	yeah
B	growing upness erm they've missed out
A	yeah
B	for some reason or other
A	yeah
B	erm and then
A	that would
B	mm
A	fit the way that I've even though I wasn't around to see her mothering the young ones but just how she's been
B	mm
A	it's
B	mm
A	it's it was too selfish of er like and and er in in a way that erm
B	yeah
A	it's not like it's awful and there was obviously
B	mm mm mm
A	you know
B	yeah yes it's
A	she brings them on
B	I'm mean it's
A	holidays and there's
B	yeah mm yes
A	like
B	erm
A	and that kind of thing but for example they all went to the er wildlife park one day and they lost two of the children and I just think like not all at one time
B	mm mm
A	and I know that's just
B	mm
A	isn't like people do lose but
B	yes
A	just not
B	mm
A	seeing
A	oh is it there? shall I give him a cuddle?
B	mm
A	you just don't have as a young girl
A	and she has that all the time
B	hello bear
B	hello to bear oh oh oh mummy's giving him a cuddle
B	he's beginning to accept me he took the bear and
A	yeah
B	gave it to me
A	yeah
B	er
A	yeah there's stuff kind of I dunno it's not
B	no I can't
A	that's not right
B	I can't really understand that I really erm
A	mm
B	erm I can't actually remember it's I mean she probably did tell me but
A	yeah
B	she was so unhappy
A	mm
B	and her husband kind of basically said if you leave you're not getting the children
A	yeah
B	you are not getting the children
A	right
B	erm and she erm
A	yeah
B	midnight she crept out of the house with her
A	mm
B	suitcase and left knowing
A	yeah
B	she wouldn't get the children
A	yeah
B	didn't know how to fight for her children didn't know
A	mm
B	you know a lot of people
A	mm
B	just don't know
A	yeah
B	erm and er she was absolutely devastated
A	yeah
B	and she didn't see those kids growing up
A	yeah
B	erm and I mean er I don't think she'd have left them with a with a fellow that was beating them up you know
A	yeah
B	I just think it was but
A	yeah
B	she then had another she met somebody else
A	mm
B	and she had another at least one if not two children
A	yeah
B	erm but when her daughter she read in the paper her daughter was getting married cos they were all within the
A	yeah
B	she went up to
A	ah
B	and er she her daughter wouldn't have known who she was
A	ah
B	cos they were quite little when she left
A	oh wow
B	so erm so sometimes people do leave their children because of extreme circumstances
A	yeah you can understand that
B	but but on the whole
A	mm
B	and it's a very man thing leaving your children more men
A	yeah yeah
B	can cut off from their children
A	yeah
B	they could in the olden days don't know about nowadays erm but more men can sort of do it
A	mm
B	than women can
A	yeah
B	so but that's why they find it and I mean it might be wrong of us to be sexist
A	yeah
A	mm
B	no I don't know erm er
A	well I suppose it I I don't think she'd have coped with if they were all living here I think that would have been too
B	would she want that that would have been too much yes mm mm
A	that would have been too well I I'm not sure if she really
B	mm
A	would have minded that that he she would have minded that she couldn't
B	mm
A	but she did she had them every Christmas and erm any sort of occasion that she wanted them she'd bring them back but
B	uhu
A	at other times she
A	so I think she just liked the kind of er she I suppose she did I mean not much else
A	I think she was kind of quite well or didn't really bother like
B	mm
A	a lot of the things that you you just would get stuck to if you were a mum she just there were so many things she just she never went to a parents' evening ever
B	right right
A	erm did do their confirmations
B	yeah
A	have everyone round
B	mm mm
A	erm
B	first communions?
A	first communions
B	mm mm
A	yeah everything
B	mm
A	erm
B	how young was she when she had
A	twenty
B	twenty and the same age as my mum
A	mm
B	had
A	oh right
B	and my mum was too young
A	yeah
B	you know it I mean it's erm and yet I've got a friend whose
A	yeah
A	oh yeah yeah
B	erm but it's different natures of the people you know
A	yeah
B	erm
A	do you think with some people it actually I mean
A	hello
A	yes it's granny as well
B	hello darling
A	what's that?
A	isn't he?
A	you happy there? he's always happy for the first hour when he first comes down enough and then he might
B	but erm
B	erm
A	but yeah I think they don't well don't grow up
B	mm
A	challenges of
B	that's right
A	erm doing it properly
B	mm
A	as as it
B	mm
A	probably as in
B	mm
A	getting together with somebody that you're will find out that you know you can financially support each other
B	yeah mm
A	or experiencing a bit of the world as an adult
B	yes
A	without just having this kid where you can go oh I don't have to do any of that it's like you can say
B	uhu
A	I don't have to do any of that because
C	mummy
A	I've obviously I mean I'm probably gonna do that but
B	that's right yes that's right
A	actually if you
C	mummy
A	just hanging around just feeding the kid
C	mummy
A	hello mummy
B	hello darling
C	granny granny
B	I'm granny yes I'm granny
B	good morning
A	but yeah it's very
B	mm
A	very young really and then er but I suppose because she
B	yeah yeah
B	yeah
A	but not
B	yeah
A	not long term
B	yes
B	that's right mm
A	but she was I mean
B	mm yeah mm
A	he'd be well he's be home four days of the week but financially supporting them all
B	yeah
A	and doing everything at the weekend
A	so she just I think she's also used to not doing I dunno
B	yes
A	doing er
B	it it it is it is very and there's more complicated than just
A	yeah
B	erm X er erm erm they erm you can see some of the factors if you know the people
A	yeah
B	the backgrounds that erm erm and then it's just the people but er I can't remember who I was saying it to recently
A	yeah
B	no matter what our backgrounds and no matter what's happened to us
A	yeah
B	in the middle you can you you can sort of coddle yourself if you like
A	yeah
B	sort of saying oh well that little girl or that little
A	yeah
B	that young woman or whatever is and you can be nice to those parts of your
A	yeah
B	but you cannot make them the excuse not to actually
A	mm
B	be responsible for yourself
A	yeah
B	but erm er unless it is like I don't
A	mm
B	war-torn places
A	yeah
B	people who have erm gone through erm holocaust camps et cetera et cetera
A	yeah
B	yes they bring it all with them
A	mm
B	but I don't know what kind cos I've never actually met them but
A	mm
B	they have to go on with life as well
A	yeah
B	people do erm quite a lot they do I mean they carry their backgrounds erm
A	well
B	mm
B	mm
A	fine kind of
B	mm mm mm
A	happy background solid background
B	mm
A	and they all cared for her
B	mm mm mm
A	didn't have anything really to worry about
B	mm
A	and erm but yeah it's
B	that's right that's right
B	and it's that sense of oneself
A	yeah
B	but it's like erm cos when I was in
A	mm
B	in the first year cos I thought I'm not grown up enough I am not grown up enough to bring up
A	yeah
B	three kids
A	yeah
B	and then I thought but all the people I knew and therefore knew how they were brought up
A	yeah
B	and I knew them I mean it wasn't a big load of people but and I thought
B	I thought he was upstairs
A	I know
A	yeah
B	erm
A	mm and it's it's
A	yeah
B	it's up to erm you're doing it in conjunction with the kids but also the whole of the rest of society
A	yeah
B	their school their aunts their
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	a bit of input in in there erm but it's not up to you
A	no
B	and that I thought
A	yeah that's true
A	yes
B	erm but er
A	I know there were lots of people around
B	hello darling
B	oh go go go go
B	and and as you know a child very well you don't always understand them at three
A	yeah
B	erm
A	yeah
B	erm erm cos it's just the the inflection and and the way they say it the way
A	yeah
B	of putting it together and that's very normal with a three-year-old
A	yeah
B	erm but erm but if you know them well you can interpret it
A	yeah
B	because you know whether what what the words mean
A	yeah
B	erm
A	mind you we've got the girls this Christmas
B	really?
A	yeah
B	are you so are you at home at Christmas?
A	yes yeah
B	right yes cos er
A	yeah
B	erm yes erm cos
A	right
B	er erm because er
A	oh right

A	oh
B	erm er
A	not
B	no no not
B	but er erm
A	oh yeah that's right yeah
B	with the Christmas bit but erm
A	yeah
B	and to give
B	and she said
A	oh right
B	and then erm
A	yeah
B	er erm er but they'd arranged to put her up in the loft and that
A	yeah
B	kind of stuff and I thought fine she'll go and bugger off to
B	during the day but that's the kind of thing where you to keep families in synch and erm but
A	yeah
B	but erm
A	there's often that isn't there with the
A	there's a lot of like
A	like saying and then it just doesn't happen
A	yeah
B	erm and
A	oh yeah
B	in
A	yes
B	erm
A	yes you did
B	and they want to do Christmas meal

A	yeah
B	erm er and although they have the room er they er if you have
A	yeah
B	you know sort of sitting round there rather than seven or eight adults you know
A	yeah
B	but erm erm but I wasn't quite sure what was going to happen because she like it's a
A	yeah
B	you know
A	I always think of this as the
B	erm but erm er it is their year for it
A	yeah

B	well that'll be nice for
A	yeah because
B	erm
A	I'd I'd wondered that really

A	his sister's house but his sister's house is not big
B	right right
A	it's smaller than yours

A	erm
B	erm
A	so he's going to ask her whether it's going to look do whatever you like if if they want to cook here if it's easier
B	uhu
A	if erm if you want me to cook part of it or if you
B	yeah
A	want to just stay for a bit or

A	who's really lovely
B	I know mm
A	too
B	mm and er

B	yeah yeah

B	no and you can sort of cook with all the sort of stuff that er er
A	but I think they you know people do like their territories and er that that's quite revealing in a way cos it cos even though his
B	uhu
A	family are very nice I think they they would feel too uncomfortable cos it's kind of would be my territory and me cooking on Christmas they just
B	right
A	wouldn't be able to relax
B	right right right
A	even though they're like his mum and his sisters
B	mm mm
A	would be
B	I know yeah
A	but because it was me erm
B	mm
A	it would well whereas it would be
B	mm mm mm
A	that they were
B	yes
A	I would be hosting for them
B	yeah
A	you know I'd love to give
B	yeah erm yeah
A	that kind of thing but
A	but er no I've I I'll be fine his his
B	mm
A	brother would only turn up for like a bit anyway he usually runs away after dinner bless him
A	cos he's so shy at the end he just
B	mm yes yes
A	no he he is shy but he never has you can tell he's there's no badness about there's no
B	yes
A	being funny or no undercurrents
B	mm mm yeah
A	it's just he's he just
B	what age is he?
A	erm I think he'll be getting into late twenties now
B	right so he's younger than erm
A	he's
B	and
A	oh right
B	but er it's quite good to
A	yeah
B	erm it's like I found out did I tell you? that
A	oh really?
B	they were both born in nineteen nineteen
A	oh wow
B	right?
A	oh god
B	and I I thought mm this is
B	I like these little quirks that I come across
B	you know and I
A	the different kind of ages
B	I mean she's fifty-seven she was she was erm an afterthought baby
A	oh right
B	erm her two sisters were much older than her you see but erm
A	I forget that actually a
B	mm
A	lots of women did have kids like
B	yeah
A	early forties or whatever just because
B	mm mm
A	there were no
B	cos it was
A	there was no contraception around
B	mm
A	or something and
B	erm
A	you know so it would happen
B	or and they or or else they all thought they were going through the change
A	oh yeah
B	I mean your nana erm
A	yeah
B	er she'd had your dad and
A	mm
B	she thought that's it and she got to forty
A	yeah
B	she was thirty-six when she had
A	thirty-six wow
B	and thirty-eight when she had
A	wow
B	so when she stopped having her periods when she was forty she thought it was the change
A	oh
A	but it was
B	it was
A	it was
A	and then she had
B	and then she had
A	right
B	er yeah
A	god it just
B	or it might have been it might have been thirty-seven or thirty-nine you know but I'm I
A	hello
B	hello birthday boy
A	yeah
B	or does he do this quite often?
A	no I think
B	mm
A	hello hello
A	hello there's bear we're going on a bear hunt going to catch a big one what a beautiful day we're not scared do you want teddy? shall I bring you teddy?
A	uh-oh
B	erm I that's a lovely boy that erm but this is why I thought it's fascinating
A	he's lovely
B	about people
A	yeah
B	mm
A	and different families
B	yeah
A	it's funny though cos some
B	no
A	that's the funny thing and I think that's sometimes the division like
A	for example the I don't think there's the cos they'd never think oh you know families just
B	but I mean
A	or we're like
A	yeah
B	erm we had some of the
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	and er and the three the four of us would be round the bottom
A	yeah
B	erm and they would all be up there
A	yeah
B	and they just like
A	yeah
B	they go they go
A	yeah
B	no they they are getting better
A	yeah
B	cos
A	are they?
B	there's four or nights I've had them
A	oh
B	and it's er only it's a bit unnerving
A	oh really?
B	mm
B	but erm yeah I just wish they would relax a bit more
B	er er but erm yes they've got erm erm I had to say oh you know there's food in the cupboard if you can find food in the house just eat it
A	yeah
B	you know erm er
A	mind you I do
B	oh
A	yeah
B	or
A	mm
B	but puffed wheat oh no Ricicles
A	yeah
B	and I left a tin of tomato soup
A	yeah
B	next time I go back they'll have gone because
A	yeah
B	erm
B	but er erm
A	yeah
B	no he doesn't erm er and er I think he forgets a lot
A	yeah
B	not not because he's going gaga or anything
A	yeah
B	erm but again he wasn't around for this first two children but
A	yeah
B	erm cos erm
A	I know that's quite
B	hasn't got the
A	common isn't it with a lot of men as well isn't it?
B	mm mm
A	and especially I think if they're not around the first one sometimes I think erm they especially don't er cos they think oh that's what it was like in the past and the past is that
B	yeah
A	doesn't really include all these sort of erm things
B	but he was in Africa you see
A	yeah
B	for the first two that er
A	yeah
B	came out for a while
A	right
B	but I don't think he met
A	oh yeah
B	erm
A	yeah
B	erm er erm but they are the they are just I mean they just launch into things and
A	yeah
A	yeah
A	I mean they're all quite funny I mean I don't really mind any of their company to be honest
B	mm
A	I mean
B	well it's only
A	just
B	if people get huffy
A	yeah
B	and sniffy or whatever with you in
A	yeah I mean he can be very arrogant but
B	yeah mm
A	I don't feel I feel old enough now
B	mm
A	and
B	mm
A	comfortable enough in myself not
B	yes
A	to care or to just
B	mm
A	tell him straight
B	mm
A	but that's that's alright
B	see I think for years
A	yes he
B	uhu
A	I think a lot of
B	mm
A	I think
B	mm mm
A	a lot of the erm strains can be
B	mm
A	because of that because of
B	mm mm
A	not erm
B	mm
A	somebody
B	mm mm
A	and that sets up a
B	mm
A	quite a hard dynamic
B	and it really was just because you know they
A	yeah
B	you know erm
A	people were a bit like that about
B	mm
B	yeah mm
A	oh and then it's because she's you know she's not quite like the others and so we've got to like all this skirting round somebody at a young age
B	yeah yeah
A	it's not good
B	no no
A	just be straight
B	that's right
B	erm yeah because erm when
A	mm
B	and
A	yeah
B	erm and he was erm er and he got this dreadful fellow in to I mean and it cost us loads of money in the firm
A	mm
B	that we didn't have
A	yeah
B	erm to get this this fellow to do things
A	yeah
B	and I said to I said to
A	mm
B	I said basically what you need are more salesmen you don't need another
A	yeah
B	administrator
A	yeah
B	you need two more
A	yeah
B	erm and in the end after about a year that's what he decided you know?
A	but it's funny isn't it how do sometimes people set someone else up to have certain qualities
B	mm
A	and they won't budge
B	mm
A	like
B	mm yeah
A	must know he's the intelligent one and he's the business person and and also and also to be kind of a bit frightened of your own
B	mm mm mm
A	I find that quite odd but then and then imbuing like
B	and it's not good for
A	yeah also it's not good for
B	mm mm mm mm
A	like you said
B	mm
A	he loved being bossed around by
B	oh yes he was
A	he loved it
B	quite
A	yeah
A	I know
B	mm but erm
A	because people like something being you know
B	mm mm
A	cos er people who don't stand up to him it's kind of an odd world for you to be in erm
B	that's right that's right
A	in
B	erm
A	but also stuff's pretty new in
B	mm
A	you just think well
B	she doesn't
A	no actually
B	she doesn't she doesn't
A	yeah
B	you know and she's not erm from the top drawer
A	yeah
B	erm and very much so but it was like that when when
A	yeah
B	they first arrived you know erm and erm
A	but these can change if well as well cos er
B	and I was
A	I think I was just
B	terribly naïve I think
A	yeah
B	you know cos I I'd grown up with my family and my
A	yeah
B	family came from you know it wasn't quite top drawer enough for them either
A	mm
B	in one way
A	mm
B	but I mean I think that's cos
A	mm
B	you know erm but they but he was from a different set set
A	mm
B	but both our fathers had gone to the same school and that kind of thing we were in the same Catholic
A	mm
B	environment erm but
A	mm
B	er er so we didn't have any sort of family stuff going on when you were in
A	mm
B	and really it was it's more friends
A	mm
B	yes we had
A	yeah
B	and
A	yeah
B	but erm on day to day things it was just us and
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	huge
B	it was actually kindly
A	yeah
B	they had good intentions
A	yeah
B	you know it wasn't they were nasty
A	yeah
B	it was just they were totally
A	also I think some people don't
B	uhu uhu
A	the territories move
B	mm
A	there's some erm
B	mm mm
A	most people aren't
B	mm
A	erm one is more dominant and won't realise that
B	yes that's right
A	and then there's erm there's er it can be
A	when you you you for both sides it's not even just sort of the side
B	mm mm mm
A	that are not
B	I know I know I know mm
A	where it's awkward until
B	mm
A	until the if you're just er find some kind of harmony in there and that that can
B	mm
A	take a a long time but it just doesn't happen very quickly unless there's been you know there's it's been much more caring but most most of us don't do that
B	oh no we just go for it
A	yeah
B	you know we just right and then we've got you know
A	yeah
B	erm
A	and also
B	and also
B	mm
A	yeah shall we
B	mm
A	sit in there?
B	erm
A	even though he moves from room to room so actually it is more difficult to see him he's he's quite a careful boy so
B	yeah yeah that's true
A	I actually
B	erm erm
A	yeah
A	I'll sit here we can erm we can move the sofas a bit you can on another one
B	oh no I'll sit this end of the sofa and we can just talk to each other
A	yeah
B	without shouting
A	well do you want me to move the sofa though? but you're it's
B	no no no this is
A	it's quite far
B	this is absolutely fine I just I love this place
A	I'll sit here so
B	and I
A	I can I can see you
B	yes well I I can see the front garden
A	oh god
B	and you have
A	I'll just move them a bit mm don't er it's so it's so
A	easy to move you just remove them onto this
B	yeah erm
A	and we'll see how much that actually he's er
A	he's in the in the middle
B	erm but the
A	yeah they are they're really
B	erm
A	light actually
B	erm
A	to move on the
B	erm
A	I'll put these down yeah
A	yeah
B	I'm trying different seats and different
A	yeah
B	don't
A	yeah
B	don't worry about him
A	yeah
B	erm I'm going for
A	oh yeah
B	I said no erm when I was here last time he liked bricks
A	yeah
B	and he loved dinosaurs
A	yeah
B	erm so he's got bigger scope now
A	yeah
B	but but
A	oh really?
B	she's got she's got the feminine bit of you know welcome to the house she's so happy
A	really?
B	it's gonna be a
A	yeah
A	ah
B	I think something must have happened cos I think
A	yeah
B	erm and I don't know if
A	no
B	but erm but I think
A	oh really?
B	you know I think so
A	oh
B	I'm not sure
A	I didn't realise he was that old
A	mm
B	of them in their sixties
A	yeah me too
B	erm but anyhow for some reason or other
A	yeah
B	it's gonna be cooked round at at
A	oh okay
B	erm that means that
A	yeah
B	but it is her family
A	yeah
B	erm
A	and she and I
B	erm oh yes she does but
A	really?
A	oh really?
B	oh she'd much rather that's why I quite often try to go to their house
A	just do these doors in the
B	and not take them to my house to be looked after
A	yeah
B	erm because
A	yeah
B	she loves she loves
A	yeah she is isn't she?
B	being at home
A	she loves
B	erm
A	that kind of sort of do you want a blanket?
B	no no no no I've got a scarf I've got erm
A	I'm having a blanket
B	er because erm er no erm
A	you can see that it's er
B	as far as I'm
A	little walk in a minute
A	I take him for a little walk er and he's
B	good
A	yeah
B	can I come with you?
A	yes
A	just just you know he's but
B	mm
A	he actually sometimes wants to go quite far so well I have to
B	mm
A	tell him no cos
A	knackered on the way back
B	yeah yeah and he's quite quite a big boy to carry all the way back
A	yeah
B	yeah yeah but yeah
A	he does he he's very doesn't doesn't like erm
B	right right
A	if it means crossing a path and getting back he gets all he really doesn't like it he starts you know screaming
B	okay right
A	I've started trying to I'm not sure whether to go the
B	right it's a it is it is quite hard with a
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	not just numbers but er
A	yeah he loves letters as well
B	and he loves letters yes
A	but he's got
B	mm
A	to to see if he'd do sentences but actually he's not really using them like that but it's okay
B	mm
A	I
B	oh yes erm
A	out of cornflake packets look I did
B	oh lovely
A	all of us and then I erm
B	oh
A	and then I did like mum it's cos I was trying
B	mm
A	to get him to do that that's mummy
B	mm right
A	and
B	yeah
A	this is juice I was gonna
B	mm
A	sort of get him to ask for juice and sort of and I've got
B	mm
A	the word juice by it
B	yeah
A	and actually as soon as I showed him the word he got the word straight away rather than you know most kids they learn
B	mm
A	from you talking to them don't they?
B	that's right
A	and that's erm
B	mm
A	I'd say things like where it is but er
B	he's only three dear
A	yeah no I know but the thing is he seemed to be erm getting
B	getting getting getting all of that stuff like
A	he seemed to be
B	oh right right right
A	rather than if he has to listen back and forth it actually does his head in a bit it doesn't really erm it it it can distress him a bit it's like he's not doesn't er like if I'd say for ages I'd say do you want some juice? or er and
B	mm
A	he wouldn't know what I was talking
B	mm
A	er but he so he just he
B	how is his hearing?
A	well we could've got his hearing more tested and I I
B	mm
A	didn't yet actually I went to the doctor's a year ago and er just asked them her to give him a quick
B	mm
A	check about glue ear and things and I thought she was gonna do you know a good test they're a bit annoying in Ireland she did kind of check out his ear and have a look in and said
B	mm
A	his ears were
B	mm
A	fine in that way they weren't blocked but then she gave me this name of a audiologist oh god
B	mm
A	typical Ireland it's like their system because everything has to be paid for
B	mm yes yes
A	she gave gave me like
B	mm mm
A	she said doesn't usually don't think he
B	mm
A	a bit older
B	yeah
A	er a more specific one and after that he seemed he it like for example I was I playing him whole lists on Youtube of things he likes
B	right right right
A	and he'll he'll say it back
B	yes yes
A	he'll see it and he'll say it back
B	mm
A	especially things that are
B	well I that's erm it's it's only
A	but I might be wrong
B	no no but his hearing is
A	yeah
B	er
A	oh yeah
B	you see I could learn by listening to people
A	yeah
B	er but reading it
A	yeah
B	it wouldn't go in I had to read out loud to myself
A	yeah
B	and then it would go in you know?
A	oh yeah
B	erm
A	yeah
B	so we all we don't all learn the same way
A	yeah
B	erm and he if he's very visual
A	yeah
B	and erm then that's not because the other senses are wrong
A	yeah
B	it's just that he's erm that's the way his brain fires
A	yes
B	basically
A	yes yeah
B	erm did you watch Michael Mosley erm beginnings of life or you know in the womb?
A	oh I only saw like the tiny bit the end of it I wanted cos I recorded the last one
B	mm
A	but I
B	mm
A	I'd only seen
B	oh it
A	did they say anything about
A	but yeah
B	it was
A	yeah
B	and erm it's just I didn't realise just I mean I just thought that two you know sperm and egg got together and it grew a baby that went through various stages that looked like tadpoles or whatever is you know
A	yeah
B	but erm erm but I mean the the times when you get certain bits of you
A	yeah
B	erm and it's it's if if the hormones that come in if they start the next thing
A	yeah
B	don't happen it's like this family had all six fingers but
A	wow
B	you know this this like village all sort of had six fingers
A	yeah
B	so people get you know if they only get five they get but and it's because erm they get an extra something
A	extra
B	but a
A	yeah
B	erm they erm er and it's it's actually he said well part why do you think that nature has kept this on?
A	yeah
B	and it's because they're very good at catching things
A	oh yeah yeah
B	and throwing things
A	yeah
B	cos they've got this extra finger so it has an advantage in human evolution but
A	yeah
B	that hadn't just gone completely out that erm
A	yeah
B	erm but I
A	I just saw the last bits and they were
B	mm
A	saying that
B	cos I like
A	some women who are stressed
B	erm
A	cortisol and they're
B	mm
A	and or
B	or
B	mm
A	erm there's a delay or allergy and that kind of thing
B	mm
A	but that's quite difficult to test isn't it?
B	whereas
A	yes
B	there were a lot of people erm and they can't put mothers to be under stress you know they can't test it
A	no
B	but er erm but they erm er but it was it's fascinating just to see I mean I didn't realise the nose started in your forehead
A	no I didn't know that
A	yeah I'm fascinated
B	mm
A	about how how things grow and how kids grow and how they
B	mm
A	and it's amazing just how they develop
B	and you're like a tube till you're about three months old and then you get you get a body you know?
A	wow
B	and you're like this tube thing but erm erm and because I'm not a quick learner I don't remember it all but er it
A	yeah he's he's such a nice presenter isn't he?
B	he really is
A	but I noticed in one of his
B	yeah mm
A	because in his like
B	mm
A	you know live forever kind of programme
B	right yeah
A	he said he was pre-diabetes and he was trying to do this two five diet to stop it
A	so oh poor thing it obviously didn't work
B	erm but but yeah
A	yeah he's a really he's
B	he's he's a really interesting fellow but erm erm
A	but yeah I do find it very fascinating how it's amazing that we we're here at all when you think of how many things to happen and how many just tiny little things get missed out or
B	yes mm
A	even with
B	and most of us
A	people's diet
B	have got five fingers five toes
A	yeah
B	you know? erm
A	yes
B	erm from from when we're born that erm
A	yeah
B	erm but er and
A	but yeah that wasn't to teach him to read somehow
B	mm
A	the girls were like
A	I said I'm not actually I don't wanna I don't necessarily want him to read I want him to be able to erm communicate more
B	yes yes
A	and lose his frustration but
B	mm mm
A	it's er you do you can but actually he can read all those now
B	mm
A	but he doesn't necessarily know
A	what they are
B	but that's that that
A	yeah
B	reading is only looking at this jumble
A	yeah
B	reading is memory
A	yeah
B	to a great degree yes you know we've got to teach people how to do it phonetically because erm
A	mm
B	erm that's you know it's a breakdown of of language if you like written language but on the whole when you take when children first learn it is just seeing
A	yeah
B	you know and yes you can do it by phonetics they learn
A	yeah
B	phonetics they put erm but I've never been able to sort of really get into my head D O G dog you know it doesn't make sense to me
A	see I think I'm
B	well now those those
A	yeah
B	seeing it
A	yeah yeah
B	that makes sense to me
A	yeah
B	you know erm
C	hello
A	hello
C	hello
A	hello
B	happy birthday
A	hello
C	hello
C	oh no
A	oh no
C	good
A	do you want a cuddle?
B	mm
A	whee
A	mm
A	gotcha
A	hello
C	one
A	one
C	two
A	two
C	three
A	three
B	and he's three today three one two three
C	one two
B	one two three three today
C	one one
A	one
B	two three today
A	doing a cuddle?
A	you busy he's a lovely boy but it's actually over the last two or three weeks he has started to just it's like he's
B	yeah yeah
A	and sounds like me
B	mm
A	juice because they want it or
B	yeah
A	that kind of thing
B	yeah
A	erm so it's like he's starting to come out with a few more complicated things than other kids
B	mm
A	and suddenly do
B	yeah yes yeah
A	but it's kind of sweet because
A	he kind of just pronounces it in a kind of
A	ma ma ma
B	in his own way
C	mummy mummy
A	instead of going
A	what's that? so again if there's like a noise he'll go what's that noise?
A	don't you? and then when daddy comes back you go it's a daddy it's a daddy
C	is there a daddy?
A	oh no no
B	no no daddy at work
C	that's is that daddy?

C	oh
A	it's interesting though getting the
A	ah

A	at how much he didn't do

C	socks
B	socks
A	mm you're such a clever you know what socks and your shoes are yeah
B	yes erm
A	oh yeah
A	yeah
B	he's so proud that he wants him to do all his wee tricks
A	yeah
B	when people are around and to know but er
A	I know I know
A	he really did want him to do that didn't he?
B	that's right yeah
A	they don't they don't really do
B	but
A	children don't perform when you want want them to
B	erm that's right that's right but er but you could see the pride in
B	face and voice when they you know
A	yeah
B	erm yeah
A	I know I think if he's it's been a bit because at times I think he's been oh he hasn't cos he was erm he's actually talks loads more now but there was other times when he just wasn't really
B	that's right
A	talking much for ages where you get very frustrated erm I mean sort of still does get frustrated but erm but yeah it was interesting cos they'd I'd looked up I'm just interested in these kind of little tests
B	yeah yeah
A	but they're not it's not it's the one they I think they use as part of a an autism assessment but erm it's if you were gonna do it officially you'd have
B	yeah yeah
A	other people to making reports
B	yeah
A	that kind of thing so it's only
B	mm
A	part of it
B	mm
A	and it was two hundred fifty euros and I thought oh he would
A	bypass the hearing test and
A	and also I did ring up I didn't realise you could self-refer for the speech and language therapy people like people
A	oh right right
B	not that I'm not I'm not sure they'd be able to do but they're I phoned up and they gave me a form but they said it's at least a four or five month wait before you even get
B	really?
A	accept er assessed and also I bought him along to this two they had a two-year development thing
B	right right yes
A	and you
B	yes yes
A	I can't remember something happened like we put him on the scale
B	mm
A	too quickly or something
B	mm
A	and he got upset really quickly and she just said oh well can't do this like
A	so she didn't do the assessment
B	yeah yeah
B	I see you
A	are you okay?
B	and where is bear? bear's on the floor
A	are you okay? you okay?
B	poor old bear bear's on the floor
A	ah and then I phoned up to get some more and then never rearranged with me
B	mm
A	like I phoned up a couple of times
B	yeah
A	so we actually just sort of missed that and I thought that's that's a bit er slack
A	cos they they could have surely she could she could have told me that at the time
B	mm yeah
A	that you can refer yourself to a speech and language erm person erm I I mean I don't know if I'm right but I
B	yes yes yeah
A	but I
B	mm
A	erm they'll they'll either
A	you know a bit on the spectrum
A	or they won't and even if
B	mm
A	if they don't we'll get nothing if we do I'm not sure if there's gonna be anything
B	it can be done
A	useful
B	mm that's right
A	or if I go to a speech and language and they'll assess him and they go oh well his speech is delayed but we can do this er but no I could sit down and say look this is this whole person
B	that's right
A	and erm
B	yeah
A	can I just
A	woo woo anything he finds like
A	harder than other kids like
B	mm
A	going for a walk
B	yeah
A	maybe I don't want him to be
A	I know that all kids go through the
B	mm
A	erm a phase but so anything that's worked for other people and
B	mm
A	erm
B	and also
B	just talking I know that when
B	there's a genetic problem in their family
A	oh yeah
B	they actually got to talk over the computer you know
A	oh yeah?
B	to people in all
A	oh yeah?
B	and she found that just so helpful talking to real people
A	oh right
B	who'd had real pregnancies and and and you know and had it in the family and that kind of thing er
A	just a bit of kind of background
B	just it's just
A	context for you isn't it?
B	that's right that's right erm erm
B	erm cos er
A	because he's
A	erm
B	what erm what age do they start school at?
A	erm it'll be two years for him
B	two years for him yeah
A	cos it's erm
B	yeah yeah
A	missed erm the
B	mm yeah
A	so it'll be so he'd start preschool what
A	preschool this year so he'll be started up at preschool next year
B	yeah
A	gas what's gas come from?
B	but I keep predicting wrong I keep
C	wow wow
B	and you weren't shy when you
C	wow wow
B	I know kind of like
A	wow wow
B	erm
C	wow
B	erm and sort of like
A	wow
C	wow
B	and
A	everyone's gonna
C	wow
B	mm I dunno
A	and he can't
C	wow
A	wow wow
C	wow
A	wow
B	oh he's going to be underneath there he's got his feet underneath the couch
A	and yeah
B	mm
A	getting really dusty
A	erm
B	no no
A	yeah don't
B	I wouldn't go right in there darling I know there's something there that you know is there let mummy
B	is that mummy's?
C	uh-oh
B	uh-oh
A	yeah uh-oh hello
A	whoosh
A	one two three whoosh
A	like whoosh is a word that I
B	mm mm
A	lots of teenagers do but it's definitely more than other people and for the last two weeks
A	he lost he's lost his phone once in
A	three different jackets
A	three different jackets
A	and I was just like
A	like I do and at school
A	like every year every year they'll say
A	oh yeah he's a good boy
A	he's a very good boy but he's erm he gets very distracted he finds its hard to concentrate and erm and now I'm wondering whether to
A	erm get him a little bit of support as
B	no
A	I don't quite know which way to do it with er well when I
B	mm
A	but they're but I do find that people have started to
B	no no
A	I don't think that's the case
B	erm
A	so I just have to think about that but he it's funny though cos he he looked up himself being hyperactive online or something
B	really?
A	and so he took a questionnaire and he got it like it was all like him
B	right
A	but erm I mean I
A	that are just a bit harder than other people when
B	yeah
A	it's hard enough to be in a
B	mm
A	he you know he
B	but there's er this big
B	of children's lives with some children when you realise that that's the child you've got if you see what I mean
A	yeah
B	so you look for ways of helping that child
B	fit into that nature cos it's
B	not going to change
B	but there's erm ways to
A	yeah I know
B	but erm erm
B	and that's where I think finding out about erm
A	well
B	right yeah
A	like last year
B	yeah
A	and he
B	mm mm
A	but over half of them
A	like every
B	mm mm mm
A	you know he's and erm so I can do things with him at home and
B	yeah
A	and I can sort of try and influence as much as I can in school as well erm but but I'd like to do more to help him
A	not quite sure what I'm gonna do I mean er we did get a little book
B	mm mm
A	about people
B	mm
A	who are hyperactive and
B	yes yes
A	it's
B	yes
A	so maybe there's something maybe it's something else
B	mm
A	or erm or maybe something like I know with
B	yeah
A	get her assessed
B	mm mm
A	because then we can help her
B	mm yeah
A	cos they were the ones who said there's something
B	yeah
A	up with
B	yeah
A	it wasn't
B	yeah
A	erm from the parents actually
B	yeah
A	erm and then she got I
B	mm
A	er able to bring a computer in instead of having to
B	yeah
A	to write stuff
B	yeah
A	extra time er and she would not be in university if she hadn't had that label
B	yeah yeah
A	cos she also got extra points
B	yeah
A	and everything as well so she just wouldn't be there she would probably be I dunno she
B	in a in in in a betting shop
A	she could have yeah and so it made quite a big difference I think
B	mm
A	I dunno I mean
B	it us but er
A	yeah
B	erm it's not it's not that we are sort of erm pushing them in a direction against their nature
A	yeah
B	we want to go with their nature erm and erm
A	but the assessor it's funny cos they the they for him like they have erm er they cos it's for younger kids they set it up like a play thing so you go into this
B	right
A	into this room
B	mm mm
A	and they so you'll
C	shoes
B	shoes? where are your shoes?
A	and then they have different little games and I had looked it up cos I look everything up online and it's like
B	yes yes
A	what's this? and cos I used to do psychology
A	it's the kind of thing I would have you know
B	and also you have a discovering mind
A	yeah
B	you've got to understand things and
A	yeah erm
B	that's why
A	oh yeah I did I read it
A	and I was quite interested she was quite a a rare form isn't it? erm and then they so they so they get you to do different things
B	any three please three three please give me three
C	are they shoes?
B	I've got my shoes on look this one this one this one
B	oh right not three? granny
B	three three

B	I don't want you to scream no I want you to you know that other one that
A	yes
A	hey
B	mind you we had erm
B	oh oh walkie time is it?
A	no I won't I'll take him for a walk
B	talkie time
A	he has to be really
B	oh
A	he's gonna be hungry when he goes out
B	thank you where does it say daddy?
A	that's daddy
A	that's daddy
B	no no I was trying to look for the word daddy
A	oh
B	erm can't find daddy
A	there you go
B	oh thank you daddy
A	do you want some more coffee or are you okay?
B	I'd love another cup of coffee
A	oh
B	but my coffee cup's on the table I think just
A	okay
B	keep using it till it gets too dirty
A	okay
B	but er
A	oh
C	mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy
A	mummy mummy
C	okay okay
A	okay
B	oh yes please
B	there's a bit of space there now
A	yeah
A	we can just keep an eye on him
B	mm golly no wonder there are a lot of things here
A	I love that book
B	there's loads
A	I think it's really nicely done
B	yes it isn't it lovely? bicycles
A	but yeah at at the test actually at the end
A	it's funny cos they got they try to
B	mm
A	but I'm not
B	yeah
A	they they called his name
B	what did what did they do with the
A	oh they put out different things erm and tried to engage him in different activities
B	right right
A	it's funny cos
A	stop it
B	did did you did you watch through a window or the you were actually sitting there?
A	no we were in we were in there but er
B	oh okay
A	I knew as well from the tests it they they had to do things a certain way cos this this is the
B	right
A	are just er interviews I think if you were gonna have an official
B	mm
A	assessment cos erm they're sort of trained in it to ask a certain number of times and then assess whether they've how far they've responded what level
B	right
A	and they
B	right right
A	or whatever er and
A	and a few times he was like go
A	couldn't prompt him
B	interfering
A	and I was like go on there was also a part of me thinking like they've got to properly assess and it's not so that he'll pass it's so
A	if he doesn't then we should have some support or help so we
B	and was it was it sort of things like
A	it was
B	er was it that kind of thing or was it?
A	yeah it was very simple it was
B	mm
A	trying to get him his attention into something erm that was an activity we were doing together I think
B	right yeah
A	that's erm that's what a lot of it was
B	so what what er describe
A	so they had bubbles
B	activities
A	well er the there was there was bubbles for example they say the bubbles and they try to get them to say pop well like I
B	oh right right
A	cos I've looked up before I
A	so
A	and then go pop
A	pop pop
A	and then going pop and then and he did it and yeah
C	pop
A	yes
B	pop
C	pop
A	pop and like
C	pop
A	pop erm and I think even if erm they say their name I saw the test that even if they just vaguely looked but
A	he didn't used to respond at all
B	mm
A	you hidden them? you hidden them away?
B	they were here but they seem to have gone
A	yeah
B	erm
A	erm but he immediately went to these blocks cos they had the alphabet on
B	right
A	he was just
A	thank you very much erm and
A	they had like fuzzy thing but they were trying to get him to go with it but he was having none of it
C	one one two
A	ten big jars
B	and
C	yeah
A	sorry?
B	did they get him to do his good things like painting?
A	no
A	they I think the
C	one two three
A	they got out the dolly
C	one two three one to three
A	one two three
A	and the dolly was eating
C	one one two three
A	and were having a tea party and they were
C	one two three
C	one two three
A	they knew that's because
C	one two three
A	kids who are a bit autistic they have problems with
B	oh cos
B	very much so yes yes
A	and erm
C	one two three
A	he wouldn't have
A	she
C	one two three one two three
A	bash it like that and he ran away with her when they were trying to do some of the stuff and then they put some little snacks out for him
A	just wouldn't go near them but then erm what so they finished and he ran straight over to the desk and things cos it was full of numbers cos she was doing
B	right right
A	a thing on and he was really into that
A	but that wasn't part of the test
C	one two three
A	one two three you want to be jumped up one two three
B	three up he goes
A	but she did say afterwards they were just having a just having a general chat and
A	it's not like he's a bad
A	shh
C	uh-oh
A	at it's often it's
B	uh-oh
A	either
C	uh-oh
A	well look if I take
C	uh-oh
A	actually
C	oh
A	erm
A	like if you tried to do the three thing with him
C	one two three
B	yes he'll just remember the numbers
A	he's not having it
B	no
A	so she was saying erm
C	one two three
A	oh yes maybe you're thinking of school and you know problem with transitions and oh yeah that's also
C	one two three
A	I hadn't really thought about it but I thought yeah if he's going from one activity then the next
B	yeah that's
C	one two three
C	one two three
A	visual
C	one two
A	about what's going on
A	because if he doesn't know that to communicate that might be quite
B	yeah
C	three
A	anxiety for him
C	one two three
A	and he might respond
A	I said oh I've been doing these things
C	one two three
A	she was
C	one two
A	she said
A	we do this ten times
A	one two three
