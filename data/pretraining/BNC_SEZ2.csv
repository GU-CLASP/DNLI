A	erm yeah no I think with like I'm thinking forty pounds
B	yeah like I
A	I I'm I'm yeah I need to email him and say that
B	oh god he's going to get two emails from us now
A	have you emailed yet?
B	yeah I already spoke to him erm I sent him an email last week I didn't go to my training session on Thursday
A	yeah
B	cos I just I was sitting at work and like I was really ill last week anyway so I didn't train at all and then after sitting at work I was like you know what? I don't really want to pay forty pounds to go there
A	no
B	work out and knowing that I'm not going to be able to do another work out until next week
A	work out yeah yeah
B	because I just can't because I've got so much running going on
A	yeah
B	I just can't commit to doing enough weightlifting sessions and therefore I won't get any stronger and even though I know the technique I still won't build I won't be getting physically stronger I think I've
A	yeah yeah
B	noticeably stronger but the moment you stop training or you miss a few sessions your weight drops dramatically and it just it just isn't unless you really dedicate so much time to it you can't get any stronger
A	yeah because I I felt thought with your running you've definitely lost like you've lost loads of weight
B	I haven't lost any weight I've actually gained it
A	er I it doesn't I I thought I cos I
B	oh thank you I think I just like toned more like I know that I'm always going to have a big bum I've always had a big bum and I can accept that
A	that's a good thing
B	yeah but I don't yeah I mean I don't put it on really here as much as I like I obviously I had like a slightly I had a I have a food baby occasionally but like I normally have an okay stomach so I'm not too worried about it but that's the one thing I like about Kim Kardashian she's brought it big bums
A	yeah yeah and the in and the out
B	yeah she's brought in the small waist and the big bum that's the one thing I like about her everything else I loathe but
A	yeah yeah
B	yeah
A	I don't mind her I think she's actually really clever with how she's made er so much money
B	oh yeah how she's like how she's manipulated the system and just made so much money out of nothing is a joke
A	I
B	oh yeah definitely but like I think I'd like to lose a bit more I'd like to lose a bit of weight but I always find that when you do like more exercise you eat more because you get more hungry don't you? so but no I was really like I was really nervous about this half marathon and then I did this fourteen K fifteen K run on Sunday and I did it quite easily like that's the longest I've ever done a
A	yeah
B	normally I've only ever run ten maybe eleven at a push
A	are you like dead after it?
B	no I was fine actually I was quite good erm I was a little bit sore like my legs hurt and like it's really weird how you under bum hurts like the muscle under your bum
A	that's a good thing that's that's good though
B	yeah so I'm really I'm much more confident now about the half marathon and I think like I quite actually enjoy running like
A	amazing
B	so like
A	when erm when is it?
B	thirteenth of September
A	shit
B	I know it's like four weeks away
A	that's horrible ah wait that's not thirteen weeks?
B	four weeks
A	I I was like
B	thirteenth of September
A	I was like sorry yeah mm
B	yeah four weeks away
A	mm
B	and erm I think if I enjoy it and I do okay
A	amazing
B	I'll do it again but yeah it was like I think cos Sunday was a really really nice day and I set out running with a friend of mine and we weren't like pushing it like I wasn't like I probably could have tried a little bit harder but I just wanted to do the distance to be honest
A	I was going to say and so much better to finish the run and be like I really enjoyed that
B	exactly yeah
A	I would like to do that again rather than er that killed me
B	exactly yeah so
A	wow mm
B	what is going on at the bottom of your protein shaker? how many tablets do you have to take?
A	that no they're just tablet like so when I erm eat something with like fat or calories in it
B	oh yeah
A	I need to take those otherwise my body doesn't digest it
B	okay
A	it's just like pointless but yeah and I'm I wouldn't normally have a protein shake after
B	yeah
A	fifteen minutes of cardio and foam rolling
B	yeah
A	cos I I had erm this morning obviously after doing like weights and things
B	yeah yeah
A	but erm I was expecting to do a bit more than I did
B	yeah
B	exactly like
A	I won't do it enjoy it tomorrow
B	you shouldn't you shouldn't push yourself
A	mm
B	like well you should obviously push yourself but not
A	but not to the extreme where it's going to fold you the next day
B	yeah exactly you want to build it up so that you can train like more times a week and not kill yourself
A	yeah yeah
B	or be in pain so
A	maybe I'm just going to leave
B	yeah exactly
A	like he might think that I don't know like
B	we've had a conversation well obviously we have talked about it but yeah it's not because of that
A	yeah so I'm just cos he just sort of thinks that yeah I'm just recovering
B	yeah
A	erm so yeah so I'll just leave it for now and erm
B	yeah it's just so hard and like it it took a lot I've been thinking it for a while and then I was just sitting at work and I was like you know what I'm really poor at the moment like
A	yeah cos that's like nearly like a day's work
B	it's a hundred and sixty quid a month and it's just like
A	it's a lot of money you know
B	and like yeah I earn a nice amount like I know I earn an okay amount but it's still like I've got to pay for my car I've got pay for rent I've got this month we had like a massive water bill which I had to pay for like
A	er
B	just little things add up and forty quid here or there really makes a difference like
A	mm
B	and I don't go out and drink all the time like I don't blow my money on other things it's just I have more important things to pay for and and then also this month I'm going to Barcelona and then I'm going to Paris so both I'm doing quite cheaply but still
A	but still and I think if you know if you can if you've found this love of running strange person
A	then then erm you don't need someone you don't need to pay someone forty pounds to make you do it do you?
B	no exactly or forty pounds to
A	yeah
B	never going to do it and I like I think unless you're really into it and you have the time to dedicate
A	yeah
B	and you have like no life
A	yeah no cos
B	that's the only way you're going to get like a perfect six pack and stuff like that
A	yeah
B	or you've just got really good genes
A	definitely I think I erm yeah I just I think if I got if you if I felt I got more for that forty pounds erm
B	yeah no that's no that's what I think but like it's really good when you're there but he doesn't really do anything outside of that hour
A	and he said that he yeah yeah like erm so I think one program I got sent but like nothing else
B	mm
A	like kind of
B	there's like no support there's no
A	no like with
B	yeah
A	like my money was worth it with him
B	how much do you pay with him? thirty?
A	twice a week
B	okay
A	it is thirty-five if you just do it once a week
B	okay
A	mm and so with him so it's not like I'm learning weightlifting but I'm
B	getting stronger
A	well to be fair dead lifts same as with erm
B	yeah do you think you're getting stronger do you notice it?
A	like definitely
B	do you? what do you have to sacrifice?
A	erm alcohol really but to be fair I
B	yeah
A	I
B	fitness like lifestyle yeah
A	exactly erm so once I get to the point where I want to get er
B	whey
A	it's fine
B	yeah
A	but I erm damaged my nerves erm like my arms and I haven't been able to do any upper body
B	ah oh no
A	I was able to like on Monday was my first day
B	yeah
A	but even that week of not doing it you go backwards I'm like er
B	yeah you do you just muscle just goes so quickly
A	and I've lost like it's so frustrating
B	whereas stamina like
A	yeah
B	which is the one that like running uses? aerobic?
A	mm
B	aerobic yeah like that doesn't seem to disappear as quickly like I can have a week off running
A	exactly yeah
B	and I can come back and I can run just as long
A	yeah yeah no that is interesting as well erm cos I'm starting in September have I told you?
B	no
A	like so every er a part time has the trainer course
B	oh oh you did tell me yeah
A	like every other weekend so I'm really looking forward to that and like so with erm like weightlifting I think that's kind of like from to try yeah just slow down learn one thing at a time kind of
B	yeah yeah yeah that's what I think I think sometimes you just take on so much that you just get that's what I said to
A	then you end up with yeah and yeah you're going to end up like giving something complete like stopping everything
B	yeah so
A	but yeah
B	have to see how it goes like I said
A	yeah well you that was a good excuse cos you're like well but we shouldn't be having to think of excuses anyway like if we don't want it we we're paying the money
B	yeah exactly yeah
A	we're young we can't like that's
B	mm think of all the shoes I could buy
A	no but if you think about that for example that's what you should do is you should make yourselves spend at least half of that on something like as a treat
B	yeah
A	if you do your running
B	well that yeah that's the thing like I don't I don't treat me I don't have enough money to treat myself
A	yeah so that erm that's you can treat yourself nicely with that amount
B	yeah but it's really annoying when people are just like ah losing weight the first thing to do is cut out alcohol and going out I was like but I don't drink much alcohol I drink like one glass of wine a week not even that
A	mm yeah yeah
B	like I'm drinking I'm obviously going to drink a bit on Friday but erm
A	yeah but it's your birthday isn't it?
B	yeah it's like a pre birthday going out
A	also cos you live in
B	yeah you have to drive yeah exactly and so I hardly ever drink I'm not one of those people that goes home and drinks like I don't buy wine
A	no no I do I'd rather I'd rather eat
B	yeah
A	like to make myself feel better I would rather sit and eat some
B	yeah
A	cereal is my thing
B	like I bought I bought a really nice bottle of Prosecco at the weekend
A	mm mm
B	we went to this erm we went to
A	oh nice oh
B	and my best friend came up for the day and he picked me and
A	yeah erm I'm a bit actually that's a
B	yeah but he's like a nerd who's into castles
A	oh no no I think that's actually a good mixture
B	yeah it's weird like I I luckily like for me it's completely platonic like I genuinely have no feelings for him I can understand why girls would fancy him but I just I've known him for so long I know what he's like but it's it's gone through the oh I kind of fancy him to it's so platonic we're like he's just my friend now but
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	he's like yeah
A	yeah
B	but yeah so we went to this castle which is in
A	never heard of it
B	and then we went to the seaside which was quite nice
A	yeah sounds like such a nice day
B	yeah it was real road trip
A	days like that I know I love days like that they're just the best
B	yeah and there's like this local
A	yeah okay yeah yeah and that's quite like
B	I wouldn't go to Morrisons and buy it
A	er no no no I would yeah I would rather yeah I would rather sit and eat a box of cereal which I can easily do
B	on my god Jordan's Granola Crunch oh my god
A	mm is that what you go for?
B	love it or Crunchy Nut Cornflakes what do you go for?
A	I would go for a erm chocolatey cereal
B	oh are you dying there?
A	or yeah just slowly
B	I would go for
A	like erm no what I'd go for is like the I say what I'd go for I go for quite often is the variety packs so then you've got like everything
B	oh yeah I sometimes go for them if I'm on holiday cos I hardly ever eat cereal
A	oh so that if I stopped eating cereal I would lose weight
B	really?
A	a lot quicker
B	what do you just like have a box and you just go through it?
A	I like so basically I just once once I start I just can't stop it's just so good
B	yep I'm like that with like the Jordan's Granola Crunch
A	yeah
B	but I know how much sugar's in it so I like
A	special occasions
B	yeah
A	so you have it and you can do that with it?
B	yeah I just
A	wow I wish I could
B	because it's so filling you can really only have a bowl anyway you can't keep eating
A	no
B	whereas Crunchy Nut Cornflakes I could eat like three four five bowls
A	like oh I could eat a whole thing of that yeah
B	love it but I don't really yeah I don't really eat cereal at the moment I'm eating like it's really cute I bought like
A	I'm so I'm so sorry I'm just going to grab another drink
B	are you getting another drink?
A	yeah do you want?
B	er no I'm good at the moment
B	what did what did you go for?
A	erm raspberry Fanta

B	ah twenty P it was so good bet they'd be like sixty-seventy-eight P now
A	probably probably
B	things are so expensive
A	back in the day
B	I know back in the day
A	erm yeah sorry what were we? yeah I
B	no idea doesn't matter
A	no come on we were saying food
B	we were talking about
A	food and what
B	talking about cereal I can't remember why
A	and what why it is a great conversation now don't be slating it erm yeah what is your thing that you eat like so much of that you can't stop?
B	I don't know I really don't know
A	I'm impressed that you don't have like
B	well I I've kind of this sounds really really lame I'm kind of gone off sweet things like don't get me wrong if you give me a piece of cake I will devour it
A	yeah
B	but I kind of actually I'm loving savoury like I made erm I had some stir fry veg left over and I put it in with chicken and made like but then with fajita mix on top
A	okay nice
B	and then put it in wraps with some cheese
A	yeah so fajita?

A	rubbish
B	I know sorry that that was my crazy wild thing this week
A	yeah whey
B	I treated myself to some prawns as well I felt very adult not even like cooked prawns but like the ones that you have to cook yourself
A	no way you should erm put that on an online dating profile
A	like you would get so many people
B	buys tiger prawns to cook herself
A	yeah for a treat and if I'm feeling really wild I throw some vegetables into my fajita wow you sound like a catch
B	shut up
A	yeah
B	my friend though she really confused me the other day she put chilli con carne mix in with chicken
A	I don't like chilli con carne

B	if it's like a phase or not same as like coconut water everybody raves about coconut water I'm like
A	it's got loads it's got loads of sugar in it as well
B	I was like yeah do you actually know it's probably just a complete con job and they charge you like six quid for it I'm like no
A	I know so much money yeah
B	it's so expensive
A	yeah and I I don't think it tastes very nice either
B	I don't I hate the taste of it I really don't like it
A	yeah so that might by why so if you don't like the taste
B	yeah I really don't and then you get those annoying health freaks who are like I love the taste it just it hydrates you so well like shut up
A	yeah like bull shit you do but yeah no no one can like that taste it's

B	they are grim yes they are disgusting I actually binned them
A	really?
B	I picked all the yummy stuff off the top and binned it it cos it tasted that disgusting I
A	I'm quite tempted to go and buy a cauliflower and try it
B	oh I kid you not they are horrible never do it
A	really?
B	or if you do do it make a really small one so you don't waste loads of a nice food on top it
A	really that bad?
B	yeah I binned I binned it it was that gross
A	what was in the
B	it's just cauliflower cauliflower possibly some coconut flour which I don't like at all but I don't know I give it a go but I didn't I don't think I was very successful with it to be honest

B	so basically she doesn't know if she's gay or not and she wants to test it with you?
A	yeah
B	okay
A	and I was like she was like would you mind? I was like would I mind?
A	would I mind?
B	this young hot girl coming on to me

B	oh exciting
A	yeah
B	did you ever go through with the threesome?
A	yeah
B	ah did you?
A	yeah I did it like quite a while ago now
B	oh really? how was it?
A	it was alright like I I very weird
B	oh really
A	they they like they've like sent since like full on photos and stuff like
B	are they still talking to you?
A	yeah I'm like like
B	did you do anything with him in the end? no just her
A	no yeah
B	did he mind about that?
A	well no I don't I don't know I don't know I'm like I don't know I think yeah
B	you seem quite uncomfortable about it I recommend you don't do that again
A	no like why I'm more uncomfortable about it is more
B	mm
A	that's more what it is and then er like like
B	yeah oh my god could you imagine?
A	yeah erm I was completely sober as well
B	oh wow
A	yeah
B	how was that?
A	yeah I think I I think it would have been better actually if I had a drink
B	yeah
A	like I don't know they like yeah because I had to drive I was like
B	fair enough yeah was it was it quite quick? was it over and done with quite quickly or?
A	erm I don't I don't I don't
B	they didn't
A	I didn't time it but like
B	they didn't they didn't invite you to stay for dinner did they?
A	no no and like literally I gave really short answers
B	yeah
A	erm and you know like when you spin it around so like you ask them more questions
B	yeah
A	and I found that I wasn't really answering any questions I was like I don't want you to know anything about me
B	yeah I know why would you want them to to know about you?
A	yeah yeah so yeah erm I'm kind of pleased though that it feels like ages ago now actually
B	yeah
A	erm
B	well at least you can tick that off your bucket list
A	yes I can yeah I wouldn't say that I wouldn't not do it again but just they were weird
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	erm but yeah
B	that's cool
A	erm

A	I said that to her I was like you're gay
A	erm and she's really nice not anything is going to happen but but erm yeah because that would be so awkward
B	yeah definitely going to the gym and then like bumping into her and being like yes we got with each other but it didn't work out so awkward
A	yeah exactly yeah yeah
B	and also all the guys at the gym would definitely know because she would tell them
A	well they already like
B	no no not know not know that you're gay but just like they'd like
A	they already like they they do I well
B	oh really? but like they'd all know they'd know like personal things which I don't know that I'd feel overly
A	like knowing
B	people knowing yeah
A	yeah yeah yeah and yeah but it's just nice to have a bit of gayness
B	yeah yeah definitely
A	every now and then it's just like quite nice
B	yeah I can imagine
A	yeah
B	instead of having girls waffle on about boys to you you can like actually have someone to bond about with girl
A	yeah
B	cos as much as I was as much as I'm willing to try
A	yeah it it's going to be hard let's be but that's what I have with erm like with like it's more like with they get the games like play a lot of my games like they have to pick someone right now pick someone

B	I know
A	so annoying
B	like he's nice like I don't look at him and go mm
A	yeah
B	but you know
A	but he your face does smile when you talk about him
B	he if I
A	yeah wouldn't say no
B	but erm no I think she really likes him and you know when you're just like it's not worth it
A	yeah no
B	I'd rather be friends with her and maintain that
A	yeah
B	than get drunk and like get with him
A	and she seems like the kind of person who won't admit that she likes someone because she doesn't wanna get rejected?
B	mm yeah exactly like she's admitted it to me and stuff but she's not to like I think it took her a long time to admit it to herself
A	mm mm oh she has admitted it you?
B	yeah yeah she has
A	okay
B	like we do speak about it erm and like cos obviously I got with him
A	yeah
B	but I was really drunk and stuff and she she was actually really fine with it she wasn't angry with me at all she was angry with
A	oh that's good yeah
B	and then you went on a date with another girl like that's really disrespectful of you she's my friend how could you do this to her? and I was like
A	yeah I was going to say like
B	it's fine
A	cos I think me that is really coming from how dare you kiss someone else but me be with someone else but me?
B	yeah exactly I think it's coming from her being upset more than her being upset for me
A	yeah
B	but erm
A	but she could pretend it is
B	yeah but no she likes him
A	oh she yeah she seems like really like cute as in too like sweet to just be like
B	they're just so close like
A	maybe something you know maybe a change of scenery yeah
B	oh I don't know though cos I was thinking if a guy's going to do it he's going to
A	he's gonna yeah
B	he's gonna make the effort to be with you like if he likes you enough he'll be with you but er
A	as well he does like he you said he likes Tinder
B	he's like he's a massive Tinder guy
A	mm
B	he goes on Tinder a lot but he doesn't really sleep with many of them he just dates them
A	no but I
B	yeah oh no definitely I don't think he's ready for that
A	he's like he's like similar like I yeah
B	cos that's the thing like it's so weird they have literally they're literally the perfect couple
A	yeah
B	apart from the fact they're not together
A	yeah oh yeah
B	like it's really peculiar they live together they they're best friends they talk all the time
A	yeah
B	they don't argue they might as well be together they're like a married couple but they don't have sex that's the only thing that's different
A	yeah yeah yeah oh how
B	I know
A	yeah
B	must be really frustrating I was like that's the best part about being in a relationship
A	yeah I think that must be with her
B	yeah oh no it is yeah
A	like he if he liked her
B	I told her
A	it sounds like he would be able to like or what
B	yeah I bet I don't know
A	yeah
B	but it'll be fun it'll be nice
A	so nice
B	and then it's yeah and then it's my birthday on the Sunday while we're there so
A	oh yey oh that'll be so much fun that's the perfect I think going away on birthdays is a good call then you don't get stuck with all like
B	you don't get stuck doing borings things or family things or having a really boring miserable day
A	yeah yeah
B	I don't want to so
A	this is how I normally spend my birthdays so I hate them
B	when is your birthday? tell me
A	third of December
B	okay don't worry I don't really I don't do anything for my birthdays normally cos something always goes wrong so I don't do it
A	but no oh really?
B	yeah literally the last few years have been just dire
A	oh no that's not good erm how come like are they?
B	mm one year I fell out with my best friend

A	oh fuck
B	yeah
A	so?
B	yeah and she was just like sabotaging every friendship she had and I was like well that's great isn't it? thank you for ruining my birthday
A	sounds like a fifteen year old thing to do
B	yeah she was like her boyfriend cheated on her and she was just getting really angry with everybody and
A	yeah but still I still don't I can't justify it I'm afraid
B	no I was I was furious I was like how did you tell everybody? she goes oh I didn't mean to
A	like yeah sure but
B	I was like I didn't think it was a big deal I was like well obviously it was a massive deal
A	mm yeah
B	erm and then like other years
A	oh that's a horrid way to spend your birthday
B	I know I know I literally just walked in and everybody just looked at me I was like oh fuck
A	oh god oh yeah that's that's not a good
B	I know
A	I'll give you that one yep that's
B	erm my twenty-first my parents were having a really rough time and had like a massive argument and was like we're going to get divorced but they didn't
A	oh no oh god oh that's good
B	literally my birthday is like a magnet for awful things
A	yeah you're cursed yeah oh my god be careful in Spain
B	I know
A	oh oh
B	I was like
A	yeah definitely a heads up would have been nice

A	yeah do you oh no I
B	but erm
A	I I don't mind having like when if I have like no plans one day I'm like yes usually I'm like yeah and I loved having cos I've had a free house for like a long time
B	ah love it
A	erm yes it's been so nice
B	I love free houses like I love my housemate but when she goes on holiday when she goes away I'm just like yes I just love being home alone
A	mm mm mm
B	it sounds really strange doesn't it? but
A	not but it like I think it's at feeling like feeling like a child again like freedom
B	yeah it's just relaxing
A	especially living with family and which is
B	yeah
A	erm but it is nice to cos I don't get the house to myself that often
B	no
A	I've just been like kicking back

A	no erm yeah so I haven't really made the most of it
B	so did so did your Tinder date from the other week not go anywhere?
A	yeah I knew it wasn't going to like I just knew straight away but I think if you have to put like such a lad
A	no literally I know
B	to like to to seduce you
A	I know I'm such a horrible person
B	you're not a horrible person
A	no
B	you're just young I to be fair like I'd have no effort with anybody but
A	no no no
B	I just don't care
A	no but I've
B	yeah
A	but not really
B	mm
A	I feel like I get some social element actually just from the gym
B	yeah I like going to the gym but yeah like with people I was supposed to go to this like with you and like with
A	I know and you don't have yeah yeah
B	like my friend had a birthday barbecue last week and I was like I was home I was like well I could go to it and I was like no I'm going to stay in and watch a film
A	yeah yeah yeah no but that is the thing isn't it? like you know like if you're scrolling through Facebook and you're like oh I should be doing something and you're like actually I don't want to I just want to sit at home and
B	on my own
A	watching like YouTube films whatever
B	yeah yeah
A	and it makes me so happy
B	yeah
A	with some nice food I
B	yeah I just love it so sad
A	yeah
A	you know it's funny I think it's a good things cos I used to have to on a Friday if I wasn't out I'd be like oh my god
B	you go fomo
A	exactly what's going on?
B	I know fomo
A	yeah and then yeah no now I'm just like fear of missing my house
B	but that's the thing like I I do understand the concept of fear of missing out because you do like you do have that thing like if erm if like one of your close friends hangs out with somebody else you're like ah maybe I'm missing out on some gossip
A	yeah yeah
B	but then you're like no I'm clearly not like
A	yeah exactly
B	I just don't care enough like I see them all the time or
B	when you go to a party you're like nothing interesting is going to happen anyway
A	no
B	it's just it's just going isn't it? for the sake of being there but no occasionally have a bit of fomo but not not very often
A	yeah I I think that it's an age thing as well
B	yeah
A	you're just like like go out an effort stay in no effort yeah
B	exactly
A	yeah that one sounds good to me
B	like literally last
A	yeah
B	Sunday I did nothing oh no I went round my friend's house and had dinner and then she's like my second mum she's like they've known our family since I was born
A	yeah
B	so I went round hers for dinner and then came home and went to bed like that was my weekend
A	no but I yeah
B	nothing exciting
A	that's that's perfect if you can have a film like with someone else cos then that's two in one
B	exactly
A	that is kind of socialising and also
B	yeah it was a whole weekend of kind of not really doing very much but socialising with people but like socialising with one or two people
A	yeah yeah perfect like

B	that was like so unsubtle that wasn't even
A	yeah yeah and they're doing it again yes just just checking it's still there
B	yeah just checking my penis hasn't gone for a walkabout
A	yeah
B	I hate it when boys do that they're like see their they're quite
A	I can't I know I don't know
B	they walk around why? I don't walk around with my hand down my trousers do I?
A	can you

B	boys just walk round with their hands down their trousers
A	but they can get away but they can get away with it like
B	they can yeah
A	like no one's like oh my god

A	I know it's like oh no
B	boys used to do it at school er like in PE lessons cos they're like it's really warm I'm like that's nice but it doesn't mean
A	but so
B	you're now going to touch things with your hand
A	your
B	er
A	minimum
B	oh because men go to the toilet and don't wash their hands or something?
A	think how easy it is yeah and like even if they do like he might just throw his hand under the water but like
B	true
B	er that's also
A	yeah that's really gross
B	that's one of the that's one of the things that also creeps me out about getting with people on a night out it's like think how many other people they've got with and like what like germs you have in your mouth it really creeps me out
