C	and like
A	they didn't have passports but erm
C	yeah sometimes they have passports although having them will you know

C	yeah
A	there was also
A	an Indian which is pretty nice erm then there's a then there's cooking of course
B	mm hm
C	I'm happy with pizza
A	Cos they've got a offer on it's like I think it's if you go and collect it it's five pounds sorry six pounds any pizza any size
B	blimey
A	eh which is pretty good
B	that is
A	I think it's ten pounds if they deliver eh but they shouldn't

B	or sorry how much do you?
A	em delivery is free but it's more
B	mm
A	em interesting two medium pizza's does not feed four people you crazy crazy man erm

C	you know the the two pizza bases we have

B	the erm it's probably on business and eh
C	mm
B	eh I used to actually we used to get the
C	mm
B	and we used to have the when I was growing up we had the Express and Star every day
C	mm
B	the local paper
C	mm
B	for the eh the local
C	gossip
B	gossip
A	that's interesting
B	or we would just look for jobs in the summer from the erm community shop
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	just curious as to what jobs are out there
B	eight K
C	honestly it's not much better than that
B	yeah
C	the pay is unbelievably low
B	mm
C	erm
A	here's a question
C	I think how how can people afford to live on that kind of money
C	yeah like those  those poly poly-ethylene foams you know they're
B	yeah
C	that's like for a semi-skilled job
B	that's
C	and you're paying tax on it and you've got to buy a house and have a mortgage and get to work every day
A	you know
C	it's still
B	but still
A	you can buy a house in Sunderland for thirty grand
C	mm
A	Will get you a three bedroomed terraced house
C	this this is the thing
A	but still
B	even now?
A	yeah I mean but the house would be literally gutted you would need to completely redo it but
B	I I I've em
C	mm
B	a brand new not a brand new but only one person lived in it before
C	mm
B	A new build two bedroomed house for thirty-nine thousand
A	hang on you bought a house in two
B	the years have been kind
A	not bad
B	and then somebody sold it at the peak of the property market in two thousand and
A	mm hm
B	for a hundred eh and sixty-five thousand
A	you really should have kept that
B	my dad said to me whatever you do do not sell the house and I was like but I want ten thousand pounds now
C	oh
B	I do I used that money to do my masters
A	yeah
B	but I could have now had
C	yeah
B	a hundred and seventy thousand
C	so many people became rich
B	yeah
C	just from
B	just to
C	property from no
B	even now you can get
C	even now I think it's an okay place like it's
B	that surely
C	it's not not like this
B	yeah it's
C	and it's clean and it's not falling to pieces
A	yeah but it's
C	and it is some parts of
A	just going back to that for a second
B	yeah
A	how old are you?
B	thirty-three
A	so you're the same age as
B	yes
B	I cannot believe that
A	how is that possible?
C	I think
A	thirty
B	but he can't how long has Jan been at TTP?
A	twelve years
C	but I worked  I worked
B	if he's twelve years then if he
C	yes
B	so he was twenty-one
C	yeah
A	that's insane
B	but Jan is probably ten times fitter than me which is the eh
C	which is
B	bizarre
A	no
B	yeah
C	Jan Jan's the well the things I hear about Jan he's really good at playing squash
B	yeah he is
C	and tennis as well
B	and cricket and
C	and all that sort of stuff
B	yeah
C	but but yet he just doesn't look it's just the way he's like you know
B	mm
B	no he's a well he's county squash
C	yeah
B	squash players are normally whippets aren't they you know like
C	yeah
B	that sort of build but
A	I just yeah that's pretty weird
B	yeah
A	yeah I know he's got a cat
C	his cat's got HIV
B	really?
C	yeah his cat's got HIV or a cat version of it
B	how did he get that? Off another cat?
C	the cat was like just playing around
B	is that?
A	sleeping about
B	so can a human?
C	no and not unless I I and even if you tried I don't think you'd probably get it
B	no but a cat can
C	yeah I think it's I don't think it's yeah
B	yeah cos surely that will
A	I'm sure that is
B	it would be quite the news story if cats were walking around
C	yeah
A	actually that being said I'm sure The Daily Mail will run that
B	yeah
C	Cos he was looking up for a website one day at work about erm cat HIV and I started laughing
A	that's nothing
B	mm
A	but a friend of mine managed to so the first term at uni so we had a girl at our college who was a miserable cow erm but she looked even more miserable than all and it turned out her grandfather had bitten it early on had just died
B	mm
A	who she was pretty close to
B	yeah well it's quite easy to say that isn't it?
C	eh there's actually a friend of mine in school and we were sitting in the physics class and this mate of mine didn't get on with this other mate of mine
A	right
C	and erm they were just having a go at each other and I can't remember what it was exactly
A	jealousy clearly
B	hadn't picked up on it
C	yeah
A	that's a good way of winning an argument
C	he did apologise profusely after that he was
A	I was gonna say I bet he was going it well he was probably a bit young but he had a lot of drinks bought for him
C	mm? Yeah
A	yeah
A	ow
A	ow
C	that's the dungeon door
B	is he just not wearing the top he was
C	yeah he's slowly getting undressed
C	as we're talking to him
B	took his socks off before and took his
C	and now he took his top off
B	oh no
C	oh he's he's slipped into something more comfortable
B	I thought
A	what's that sorry?
A	pretty much a normal Friday night
A	em yeah so erm sorry what were we saying? What were you?
B	cat has got HIV
C	oh yeah
B	so is
C	I don't know if it's
A	yeah
C	I think he just has the one cat
B	I might meet her
B	mm
A	erm but yeah it's that's something that would be fascinating to go and actually see cos I think it would either a complete pit or really obsessively tidy
unknown_female	mm hm
B	I think you can judge them by how somebodies desk is ordered
C	by somebody's desk
B	you know like he lines everything up eh whereas if you go and look at them Abbey Graham's desk and I for people that have been to her house
C	if you can find her desk
B	her flat is the same as her desk
C	yeah
B	it's like
A	yeah then that kinda makes sense actually
C	I remember before she moved offices
A	yes
C	but it there was one point it was just sloping down to the to there
B	but it also you know
C	it was like it was actually like
B	she sits right next to
C	yeah
B	and
A	Matthews in the mafia
C	see my desk is somewhere in the middle
B	yeah
C	and so is my
B	I have a tidy up every erm so often
C	I have a tidy up every few weeks I tidy my desk
C	but I don't mind like I throw things like all over the floor sometimes
B	yeah
C	but it will be tidied up at some point
B	you should get it really messy just between the doors
C	yeah
A	mm
B	yeah
A	mm
B	Gary being Gary
A	speaking of which how is
C	it's
B	I thought she might erm give you both barrels?
C	no
B	well she's made it pretty clear this week that
C	mm hm
B	cos she went out at four thirty yesterday
C	yeah
B	four weeks she's gotten
C	oh I like her though
B	no you
C	look at
C	he barely did anything for the last year
A	he was only there for two
B	I I I eh I I don't agree with that
C	he said lot
B	he just he didn't have that much to do
C	maybe
B	but he was conscientious till the end
C	yeah
B	but I thought
C	yeah eh Les was supposed to stay longer but even as soon as I came in there he was like he says he said I look like I left as soon as I could otherwise I was gonna say something because I thought you know
B	yeah
C	and
B	he well you
C	all that stuff
B	yeah
C	that's that's exactly why he had a very enormous argument with her was for the work she was doing
C	oh yeah
B	this morning saying
B	Cos
C	that's would have been  that would have been  been shameful if
B	yeah
C	that's what I was thinking
B	yeah
C	Cos I thought he would be away somewhere
B	yeah
A	mm
C	yeah
B	but erm
A	yeah I'm eh glad I missed that actually
B	mm
C	it could have been worse actually
B	yeah
C	but
B	and
C	mm
B	you know I don't know half those people that she knew
B	she she that turned up to
C	so if you left next week
B	just be erm
C	I think I'd just hire
B	probably just be yeah two or three people
C	you me and
B	I know slow hand clap
C	boo
A	but how long have you been at
B	three years
A	okay
B	yeah
C	there's a
B	so around the time I joined so just before me
A	no
B	so she joined six months before me
B	yeah so
A	mm
B	erm
A	who is that?
B	sits about three foot from you
A	oh yeah
B	yeah
A	no
B	didn't know
C	I can't believe
B	do you think
C	all the people that ever talk about don't say anything nice about him
A	really?
B	no
C	I don't think it's fair either I think because
B	well he yeah
C	erm who else? But
A	well presumably cos he had ideas of his own
B	yeah
C	but most people have no one anyone that's ever spoken to me about him is that
B	he has been
C	yeah
B	it's amazing how people get forgotten when they leave like completed throughout
A	you saw his tool box
C	saw his tool box yeah
C	but I'll I don't know
B	mm
C	maybe it's because the
B	that wasn't his fault
C	I don't think it was
B	that
C	no
B	would have gone wrong along time
C	and and also partly just used the situation at the time without any money
B	yeah
C	where it was all going wrong
A	oh he actually left because of that?
B	no
C	I think he probably
B	I think he was a not for since really I I've known him from MT days he was not overly you could say he was not overly happy
C	oh okay
B	and I think it was erm
C	so I feel like it did stress him out a lot
B	I bet it did
C	he's he's
B	a terrible job
C	yeah
B	just a thankless task basically
C	yeah
B	you know that's the one thing like
C	but the main thing the image of
B	yeah
C	absolutely no cash to do it with
B	and and the design was already set in stone
C	and as much as like
B	yeah
C	he'd tell me to I can't remember
B	yeah
C	but nonetheless
B	okay then you go and do it
C	you need to get it fixed
B	yeah
B	yeah
C	the situation he was in I know but I did you know you can't go against him and that you know
A	the erm what was I thinking? Erm how em that's much better formed in my head
C	do you know last month in the meeting erm remember we were talking about doing the K2 drop test? That eh
B	oh yeah
C	and David was like erm eh yeah of course as Gary was saying eh you know nothing actually works
B	Don't say that
C	you can't say that
B	it's like when Adrian piped up with the eh
A	oh yeah
B	don't yeah nobody touch the rig cos it will kill you
B	instantaneously it will kill you
C	yeah
A	to be fair
B	and then
C	you stupid
B	Don't announce that in the you know it's like
A	well to be fair but hmm
B	it would
A	yeah as in it wasn't going to be dangerous
B	yeah
A	so his goal was to frighten us into not touching it
B	yeah
A	but of course then there was this huge
B	yeah it's like
C	it gives the thing is
B	yeah but he can't not
C	yeah
B	he can't
C	but the that's part of it had been taken out
B	yeah
C	so he can can actually be primed to
B	is that has that been run yet or?
A	no we haven't got any money so
B	oh right
A	it's just sitting there currently
C	yeah
A	erm it wasn't it
C	and
B	yeah
C	erm she already has
B	and he
C	I was sitting there and watching what
B	yeah
C	I was like oh had to go and pick up her kid
B	I saw it
C	on the note of paper he just wrote where was
B	yeah
C	that was what was written
B	the first thing the next morning
C	first thing the next morning
B	he he he's like
B	yeah he went over to her and said ah so what's a matter with
C	mm
B	he
C	it's just
B	she came in at eight o'clock
C	yeah
B	you know
C	he's pathetic though
B	yeah
C	you know
A	mm
C	but he's such a
B	yeah
A	which is quite entertaining seeing as she's doing but in judgement of the quality fit
B	mm
C	do you remember when
B	really?
C	yeah
B	Cos then it reflects badly on him
C	probably
A	yes
C	he was like oh why on earth are you wanting to leave you've done a really good job? That's what he was saying to her
B	is that?
C	he wasn't
B	but you made me cry a couple of weeks ago
A	yeah I mean viewed either way that's like you don't have to like someone but that's appalling people management
C	mm
B	oh yeah
C	I remember there was one one day
A	and it's quite sorry not to interrupt but
B	it's alright
A	I was just interrupting
A	eh but that is quite a substantial and important part of his job
B	yeah
A	sorry you were saying?
C	eh so no the I remember one day erm
B	mm
C	and eh
B	yeah
C	something like that
B	he didn't?
C	I heard him say that
B	he did not
C	he said
B	I could I thought
C	he said that to her and then it was about half an hour later he ran after her and said I'm really sorry about that
B	he's
C	that is the only time I've seen him
B	yeah
C	have a go at
B	yeah
C	but he's almost
B	I'm surprised that
C	yeah you should make an official complaint about it if you think I'm having a go at my staff and then erm he was with her half an hour an hour later he's like I'm really sorry about that
A	eh two questions
C	right well
B	I think it's been done three or four times in the last six months
C	well you'd think
B	yeah
A	in general or specifically?
A	he
C	this is why
A	Cos you sit next to him that's quite
C	erm it's a bit we we used to sit even closer than that
B	he's like
C	he used to sit where Steven is then
B	yeah
A	eh huh
C	and we never spoke to each other
B	until he moved himself to eh eh his own desk which people very amusingly the other group like people walk through the office like the other group leaders like Jamie
A	mm
B	needs separate himself from the minions
A	the erm another question erm so why why this erm immunity on
B	just because she she couldn't say anything you know?
C	yeah
B	Cos she said lots of things that nobody else could get away with saying
C	you can't you can never annoy the secretary can you?
B	yeah
C	she is
B	and you know she'll just she's yeah you don't want to piss her off
C	mm
B	there's nothing  there's nothing  that you could gain by annoying
C	yeah exactly she's a
B	apart from
A	do be fair there's nothing you can gain by annoying anyone?
B	no
A	mm hmm
B	sort of got a bit of a holdover like because someone said you know because he can  he can  make your life
A	mm
B	you know
A	but he
C	but the thing is
B	what would he do to get
A	because people would just leave
C	the thing is
B	yeah exactly
A	yeah everyone is pretty employable
C	if he wants he can have a go at me
B	yeah
C	and he can say oh that's not right why are you turning up late and all this  all this  sort of stuff
B	mm
C	and I can't do anything back
B	yeah
C	whereas if he annoys
B	yeah
C	on a one to one basis from
B	he needs a good relationship with
C	yeah
B	he well you know
C	but the erm the the
A	the thing is I I
C	the delay between pissing off one of us and getting some retribution is a year or something
A	mm
C	between
A	and you just
B	he doesn't think before he
C	yeah
B	like he
A	you see the thing is I don't
B	yeah
C	see I used to think that he is probably a bad person
C	I know everyone says that he's probably a nice guy but he's just got bad people skills
B	he's
C	not massively unpleasant but just not that nice you know
B	he's insecure
A	yes
B	very
A	which has been eh one I had one or two problems with
B	yeah
A	when he's taking stuff up so very defensively
B	yeah he's
A	mm
B	yeah even when he's yeah
A	yeah so what is the history of our team?
B	so when I started it was
A	right
B	which was
A	okay
B	and
A	what
B	yeah
A	okay
B	eh
A	mm hm
B	you know like they he's like groomed
A	okay
B	erm so that's anyway so and then after a year erm of me being there it split into S T didn't exist before that really
A	sorry can you just go through that again? So it was originally MT
B	yeah originally M T
A	right
B	and half the people from M D
A	right
B	M T
A	A S must have been huge
B	yes it was it was very big
A	so so M D is how old?
B	erm a year and eh two
A	okay
B	yeah
A	A S has been sorry S T then formed and so Matthew went off to lead that
B	yeah
A	and so
B	yes
A	which M D formed a per cent of
B	erm yeah you know he was just being insecure but
A	mm hm
B	yeah just
C	which he freely admits actually
B	yeah
C	mm hm
B	erm
A	but it's an interesting cos I always thought being insecure you you would want people to like you
B	yeah
C	well
B	and it's got a bit of a temper as well
B	as well
A	mm
B	yeah so he joined when he graduated from
A	yeah
B	but he'd been there on erm eh summer placement like the year before or two years before
A	yeah
B	senior sort of thing and they used to have a right laugh
A	mm
B	the thing with
A	mm
C	yeah
B	and
C	mm
B	you can't you know
C	mm
B	and it completely changed their relationship you know eh basically he said don't ever don't
A	yeah that's interesting
B	Cos eh yeah
A	yeah
B	so that's a potted history of my time at TTP
A	oh I've learned an awful lot in the last half hour
A	that it was sort of eh that's the pizza and that's our doorbell not working again
B	I need to go and erm make room for dinner
C	and eh
A	see the interesting thing with erm
C	mm hm
A	which I think he attaches more of an importance to
C	what sorry?
A	as in
C	oh
A	erm and I think that's sort of
C	sorry what's what's
A	eh his PHD eh from
C	okay
A	and I think undergrad as well
C	aye
A	erm and I think he's probably got a bit of sort of I don't know
C	mm
A	and therefore massively like has that value distorted out of all proportion
C	mm
A	erm whereas you see
C	yeah
A	although to be fair the at the end of the day
C	mm
A	but the erm
C	eh I'll yes I might actually have a beer actually seeing as we're having pizza
B	I did yeah
A	erm drink?
B	erm some lemonade please
A	are you sure you don't want to try some of this?
B	what is it?
A	eh it's sort of non-alcoholic wine or at least something in between non-alcoholic wine and fruit juice
B	eh yeah go on then but don't open it if it's eh
A	no
B	oh right
A	so he literally can't have anything that usually says trace amounts
B	yeah
A	erm so we stocked up
B	can he wear aftershave? Or erm
A	probably not
B	yeah I didn't do that
C	yeah it doesn't hugely surprise me
A	erm oh dear
B	what do you rub your feet with?
A	eh cos eh if you look at the bottom if you look at the floor here there's some marks
C	oh yes
A	it's because the screws are poking out at the bottom of the bench
B	oh
A	Cos they they are covered in rubber but rubber compresses
B	um

B	no

B	it's got erm I like the fact that it's a solid floor you know not a
C	not concrete
