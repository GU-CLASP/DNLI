A	I mean it'd be probably like a lot quicker to be honest rather than typing the code
B	it really is yeah
A	and you know?
B	I mean I'm quite
A	do you have to use the same finger each time?
B	yeah
A	I'd assume
B	when you're doing the thing you have to put your finger on it
A	okay
B	what?
A	how do you
A	change it?
B	let's have a look
A	yay

A	oh oh I'm honoured I'm honoured
B	mm
A	yeah when I was really young I hated them
B	mm
A	it was and er like
A	like
B	mm
A	as a family when
B	oh god
A	that's what you do in
B	oh
A	and yeah
B	yeah I hated Sundays as well
B	like cos four o'clock is my least favourite time of day
A	I know
B	you know people like slow down and it's just I just hate it I've always hated it
A	and Sunday's the longest
B	yeah
B	but you're dreading the next day like
A	yeah
B	you kinda don't want it to end but it's also really tedious
A	yeah
B	and my
A	mm
B	and then she likes to describe in detail
A	right
B	all of that so that's good
A	mm very nice
B	yeah
A	great day Sundays
B	it's fucking boring
A	mm
B	no post on Sundays
A	no post
A	we need to watch that
A	we should have a Harry Harry Potter marathon
B	there's really nothing to do in this college
A	I dunno if there's more to do like cos I know we're in
B	yeah
A	yeah I
B	like some colleges aren't as good as good as the others
A	mm
A	a lot of foreign students are here which
B	yeah
A	basically so
B	they should be completely equal they're just like kind of
A	yeah
B	and
A	no I know
B	cos I mean I'm
A	I mean it's just too quiet there's there doesn't seem to be a lot going on at
B	yeah
A	mm
B	I think it's just like we just don't really go out
A	yeah yeah
B	so we can't really realise that there are actually like people
A	we could go to the JCR
B	oh it's erm you know where
B	and it I think it's like
A	okay
B	I'm not sure what food is though it's
A	to
B	to what?
A	oh
B	yeah
A	does it?
B	no I think it does does it? like
A	oh my god
B	yeah cos I I get free texts like all month but
B	oh my god
A	what the hell's
B	that was my alarm
A	is that?
B	that's what it sounds like
A	what a beautiful alarm
B	I know
B	oh I don't wanna know what fucking Donald Trump said
A	yeah
B	I really don't
A	he's a twat
B	jesus
A	that Paris should've had better gun control
A	that was so funny
B	cos everyone hates him which is brilliant
A	who even does like him though?
B	I don't know
A	I mean do you think he will? he can't
B	I don't know he probably could
A	yeah that's true
B	mm
A	er cos I get bored of weekends
B	well they're really shit up here
A	like it's not like yay it's the weekend like
B	I know
A	I feel happy on Fridays but then it's like oh
B	yeah Fridays are good
A	like that's it you need money for everything
B	everything costs money
A	like
B	cos you have to get the bus everywhere
A	mm
B	and it really adds up like two fifty
A	yeah
B	and you and you know the reason the price up on buses cos it was cheaper last year?
A	I know
B	it's it's I I don't know but I know they put them up it's because they've got wifi
A	well who needs wifi on the fucking buses?
B	I know exactly
A	I don't even
B	it just is the most ridiculous thing ever I don't use the wifi on there
A	everyone just uses data
B	yeah
A	fuck's sake
B	well actually I don't because once I used so much data that I like incurred about like a hundred pounds
A	yeah
A	I know the bus journey's gonna be quite long but I don't
B	I know they do feel really long don't they? like
A	because the bus
B	oh I know they go everywhere
A	it's really sometimes the buses stop at a stop for like ten minutes as well like
B	yeah
A	what is with that?
B	oh yeah I never get the one from
A	yeah
B	until it goes under the underpass and it's just like
A	yeah
B	I don't see why you just you just cater for the underpass then that's great that's just
A	it really is it really is
A	no
B	erm I just dunno what I feel like doing
A	I mean clubbing is just I dunno
B	like sometimes I like going clubbing but
A	you've gotta be in the right mood for it
B	yeah
A	like it's gotta have like a special event or it has to have a like a theme night or something that's actually worth going to
B	I know
A	mm
B	but then
A	but I have to admit
B	yeah I bet
A	like you could just go in and out of a club for the evening like they'd all be open and
B	mm
A	go to a pub and oh it's so good and now it's just like
A	like I wasn't a big clubber but I can imagine if
B	oh god I know
A	can you imagine?
B	although like it's very easy to actually go clubbing in
A	oh okay
B	so like
A	how much is the Megabus?
B	four pounds
A	that's good
B	I know
A	very good
B	I mean that's what I did when I went
A	mm
B	convenient
A	you you just don't yeah you just don't
B	yeah I do a bit
A	it's strange
A	I mean you do get people in clubs
B	yeah
A	they've still got that young vibe about them haven't they? and they're like
A	so cheerful and so like
B	and then when I drink I just like get more depressed most of the time
A	you do
B	yeah
B	mm
A	oh yeah
B	I wanna keep that one up though I like that one
A	yeah it's a pretty card

A	that's cool
B	yeah they had loads in there it was really cool
A	he was depressed and he chopped his ear off
B	and he
A	did he chop his ear off or somebody else do it?
B	mm
A	er
B	yeah I know it's horrible
A	that's really sad
B	no he wasn't famous until he died which is really sad
A	there's hope for all of us
B	mm
A	why?
A	oh
B	yeah
A	his paintings are so
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	can you?

A	ah
B	clothes are so expensive

A	what would what kind of item would you buy?
B	something from Urban Outfitters probably
A	yeah
A	something ridiculously expensive but something that'll
B	mm

A	that's good
B	they're so cheap
A	no spend it on yourself
B	yeah I
A	mm
B	what what what's gonna happen
A	yeah
B	so I probably should just save it
A	I hate
A	yeah
A	the ones that don't give me money
B	I know
A	it's mine
B	and
B	no
A	where's my dosh?
B	yeah lecturers are kinda rich
A	some of them are
B	yeah
A	I dunno how much they get paid though I'll
B	probably like thirty thousand maybe
A	mm
B	which isn't very much
A	how much do lecturers?
B	how long did it actually take me to eat that sandwich
A	a while
A	oh wow okay it's more than that
B	is it?
A	the University of Birmingham the average full time lecturer salary was fifty
B	bloody hell
A	with the
B	what is it at
B	where are we on the rankings this year I haven't checked?
A	okay it's we've got a table here
B	seventy-two thousand?
B	oh
A	that is a very nice
B	mm
A	how much do Oxford let's see?
B	we could just do that we could just stay on here do masters do a PhD and then work as lecturers
A	yeah
B	as if those were quite easy
A	Oxford is a
B	oh wow
B	yeah everyone's rich there anyway
B	no
A	everyone is rich in Oxford they don't need all that money
B	no I know
A	American universities?
B	especially like to get English lecturers they're really like a
A	I can imagine
B	that's what my sister wants to do
A	what? work in America?
B	no
B	yeah I dunno whether where she is really she might be in America she might be here
A	I would be like guns and shit
B	especially in the present climate like
A	mm
B	you know that's the way they are but
A	I'd be scared to go to high school in America
B	oh yeah
A	cos of all the massacres
B	oh god I know
A	and the shootings and shit like I
B	like I know they're not putting two and two
A	like it is guns causing these problems
B	I know
A	like
B	it's obvious
A	I know
B	but then I suppose how do you control it in such a massive country? like that's problem
A	mm
A	oh my god no
B	yeah yeah they might
A	what do you think they're like?
B	I know
A	oh
B	mm
A	they'll do what they
B	yeah but why? like who benefits from that? like
A	money
B	like the only reason they keep people here is for the money but
A	you are clever
B	yeah but I don't know what they expect me to like get out of oh
A	I watched Legally Blonde last night
B	oh you did?
A	yeah
B	was it amazing?
A	I liked it yeah
B	yeah
A	it's good
B	it's
A	her boyfriend was such a dick
B	oh god I know
A	is there a second one?
B	yeah but it's not very good
A	a
B	it's just like a
A	I hate
B	it was just one of those one off kind of good early two thousand films
A	is this for?
B	before it goes up
A	oh god are you getting the train home not the plane?
A	oh god yeah
B	I'm probably gonna have to leave very early cos it'll be so busy
A	yeah people will be going home
B	oh
A	I think
B	I'd have to go
A	mm
B	so then I get one yeah
A	ah at least your actual flight
B	I know I'm really excited for the flight actually
A	how far do you have to travel when you got off the plane to where you are?
B	er
A	okay
B	so not too bad
A	that's good
B	mm
A	no
B	airport cos the airport's like in a field
A	mm
A	oh my god
A	really?
A	so
B	it's so funny
B	it's mostly like private owners and stuff but
A	that's crazy
B	it's so pathetic it's like the most pathetic airport I've ever been in
A	oh my god
B	I don't think I don't even think there's like a conveyor belt I think it's just like
A	that's really cute
B	you just take your pack with you
A	and you get to go on a plane
B	woo
A	I love flying
B	so do I
A	it will pretty much
B	before I've even sat down it'll be
A	you'll just be there and then
B	I hope I get to see London though that'll be cool
A	the lights'll be on though
B	oh yeah that's true
A	and the Christmas lights which'll be great and
B	yeah
A	some of the things'll be all lit up so
B	oh
B	oh
A	that's really sweet
B	good
A	oh my god
B	in the middle of nowhere
A	that's really cute
A	oh
B	yes I will
A	we'll have so much fun
B	yeah
A	doing
B	do you have Skype?
A	yeah
B	oh yeah

B	it's only fields
A	I'm leaving on the eleventh
B	you are?
A	is that the day we break up? because
B	yeah we break up on the eleventh
A	yeah yeah
B	but I think I'm probably gonna have to miss that day because I need to get to the airport in time
A	that probably won't be a problem
B	I should've said I was going on the twelfth really but I I didn't
A	oh well you'll be able to go home a day earlier then
B	mm
A	you're thirty-six weeks right?
B	yeah
A	do we
B	no only Easter
A	then why don't we have to pay over Christmas then?
B	I don't I don't know like I really don't understand
A	like I don't get it because we're still here technically
A	okay
B	but I don't know it's I don't really know why
B	yeah I know it's it's really bad
A	I mean
B	yeah
A	cos you are your
B	just got so much stuff though that's the problem
A	are your parents picking you up or?
B	from
A	yeah yeah
B	what in
A	oh
B	oh we haven't worked it out yet well we just didn't wanna think about it but I suppose they'll have to really
A	yeah yeah
B	I think what I'll do I'll go
A	oh that's that's
A	bit better slightly better
B	but erm
A	how far is your dad?
B	er he lives in
A	mm
B	and then
A	okay
B	so it's it's like I think when you get to
A	oh right
B	to when you go here I don't really know but
A	mm
B	yeah that
A	yay
B	but I don't know how that would fit in a tiny car but
A	fun
A	because it'll just be a pain
B	and yet they still fucking told me like you can't do that you have to take everything with you like
A	like you've gotta be fully committed
B	cos I look at this room and I just think how?
A	I think
A	if you've got like
B	I mean I have got boxes
A	yeah
B	all over there but it's just a massive
A	yeah I'm gonna pack all my stuff into boxes
B	load of stuff
A	I'm gonna take all my clothes home
B	yeah
A	but put my
B	I know what I'm thinking about the kitchen is I might just leave my stuff here
A	mm
B	someone else could have it
A	but like
B	I probably
A	I thought that they said I can't remember but apparently it's just the bedrooms you have to vacate not the kitchen at
B	yeah must be cos everyone else who gets to stay would
A	yeah that's
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	it's just a fucking pain cos I could not afford to
B	it is
A	get the full
B	mm
A	my stupid
A	they are dickheads
A	erm
B	the tenth?
A	yeah
B	eighth of January

B	I'll get back on the seventh then
A	mm
B	and we get Easter off
A	which is a bit annoying
B	wait what why are there no?
A	what's up?
B	why is it? why
A	because
B	that makes no sense
A	are they all booked?
B	oh my god
A	no no
B	no it can't be
A	it won't be booked they might just not have
A	yeah I know there might just be an error it can't
B	it's
A	it won't've been booked and who books a their trains in January?
B	I know I know well people I suppose
A	like students and shit
B	I should've done this months ago I'm really my mum's gonna be so mad at me
A	if not worst comes to worst you can get a taxi I know they're expensive
B	oh my god a taxi

A	does
B	it really does
A	when's our Easter break up? is it like May? April?
B	erm it is lent term
A	lent
B	erm
A	yeah
B	that's quite a short term actually
A	January to March okay
B	that'll go really quickly
A	I know we get
B	then we break up in June
A	oh okay
B	no that's like second year even
A	oh oh yeah yeah yeah I got confused
B	yeah this is first year
A	erm

A	I hope they don't give us
B	they
A	no
A	no
B	Easter's the like non fun holiday
A	no
B	oh and the price has gone up
B	oh I hate cookies
A	what actually are cookies?
B	it's when websites try and charge you more by er like they take note of what you've been on what you've looked at
A	mm
B	you should always do it
A	okay
B	cos they try and put the price up
A	that's
B	yeah it's horrible
A	how how the fuck do they get away with that? that's crazy
B	it's evil I know
A	what if you say no?
B	erm
A	oh
A	so no one would
B	it just says
A	in their right mind would yes
B	I know it just says on this website we use cookies and then you just have to click accept
A	oh
B	but you can turn it off by
A	which?
B	can you just read it?
A	yeah
B	shit
A	a little bit
A	what is it? just a big blur?
B	yeah
A	mm
B	cos I will panic
B	it gets in at quarter to two do you think that's enough time?
A	what time is your?
B	my
A	that should be
B	that seems like enough cos I know it's like you think oh that's ages but then when you actually get there it's like you have delays and like
A	what? quarter to what?
B	quarter to
A	okay
B	and there's no like there's no customs cos it's just England so it like it would be there
A	do you literally just go in and go on the plane?
B	I I don't really know how it works but I think it's quicker
A	okay
B	cos I don't have to put my bags away or anything
A	just be mindful of any delays on the train and shit
B	but I'd quite like to go to
A	that'd be nice
B	in
B	very annoying
A	that's okay
B	I mean that's like three that's like three different trains there and back
A	it could be worse could be worse
B	that's not bad
A	why can't?
B	money though
A	I know
B	or save it
A	I hate money
B	really hate money
A	I hate why can't we have a frigging other currency? like why can't we just farm our money?
B	I don't know
A	rather than earn it
B	you should write a book on it
A	what he
A	rather than like yeah
A	we have to look in the hedges for money
A	yeah
B	mm
A	there'd be an eco crisis
B	right that's right isn't it? twelfth of December
A	mm
B	twelve fifty-seven
A	so fun to write a dystopian novel though in a way wouldn't it?
B	it would
A	just be like
B	yeah it would
A	what is the world coming to?
A	dystopian?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	I read quite a lot
A	LOL what happened to reading?
A	what
B	yeah but I don't have any ink
A	mm
B	I'll buy ink before I go home I think
A	how much is ink? like
B	twenty quid
B	yeah
B	just don't understand why it's so expensive like why isn't ink like thirty P?
A	because they don't want people to
A	they want it to be inaccessible and for it to be a luxury
B	yeah they do
A	printer and use that
B	and send that to them
A	keep my studies afloat
B	why has it taken me to some random website?
A	I mean yeah wow you're

B	it's really scary actually how do they know that?
A	they know you're in? how do they know that?
B	I don't know it's just put in
A	maybe it's because you've messaged stuff before and it's like oh
B	it's no it's cos of the email thing
