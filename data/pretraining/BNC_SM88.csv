E	well you
B	it's not cheap
D	yeah
E	there's no grant is there?
B	nine grand a year
E	totally wrong
D	mm
A	a year?
B	well a term so it's like two terms
A	eighteen grand a year
B	oh no
A	mm
B	but it's two terms basically and then you
E	that's stupid
D	mm
B	and
D	yeah
B	are at least three years
E	mm
B	so that's twenty-seven
D	well I wouldn't have gone
E	I wouldn't have gone oh I didn't go
E	I went to the university of life
D	I don't my parents couldn't
C	yeah
B	mm
D	but mm
A	yeah I do to pay that back though
C	yeah
D	mm
B	if you erm earn
D	but only when you earn a certain amount
B	yeah and then
A	oh
B	if and if you get to the age of
D	yeah
B	forty I think it is you don't have to pay it back but erm
B	yeah
A	to explain to me
D	well some people never have to pay it back cos they never earn
B	mm
D	never earn more than whatever it is
E	well around about
D	yeah
E	ninety percent of graduates don't get a job
D	no they don't they?
C	there's been an increase recently
E	really?
C	yeah there's been an increase
E	mm
C	there's been an increase
A	I've thought
D	oh
A	of a job a detective
D	a detective?
A	I'd love to spy on people
D	oh yeah
A	I'd now be so good
D	all my initials are
E	excuse excuse me
D	yeah
D	yeah
D	I spot lots of things
A	I think I'd just love it like I love all crime shows and police
D	mm
A	and
D	no okay
A	I like everything it's so good
D	yeah
A	yeah
D	school friend? she's doing erm
A	yeah
D	yeah
A	I think I would probably do
A	yeah I started watching a thing about murderers
A	and like if they have if they have like something in their brain what makes them like be a murderer
D	well they're obviously they're they're not
C	there's a
D	like us are they? they're not
A	no
C	I think there's a
D	there is
C	genetic part of it
D	there has to be something
A	cos they did like scientific erm animals first or something and they like zapped certain parts of the brain like
C	yeah
A	if there was more of it
D	mm
A	if it made them attack
C	and more aggressive
A	and if one part of like the brain is zapped the I can't I think it was a rabbit or something just went and attacked another rabbit like
A	killed another rabbit so like one part of the brain if there's more of it it brings aggression like and it's obviously it makes it easier for people to kill
D	yeah
A	cos they have more aggression
B	then you've got to take erm you do it psychology you've got to take in
A	yeah
B	erm
D	mm
B	so like their parents' relationships and stuff
A	yeah like on erm Kid Criminals or was it murderers and teenagers?
D	yeah
A	erm he'd been in the USA this one boy he was like fifteen and he killed his mum and stepdad
D	oh
A	just shot them like ten times
D	yeah
A	mm like your own mum
C	what makes you do it that's the thing isn't it?
D	yeah
D	ah
A	stepdad and like left him or something and I think his stepdad abused him or
D	mm
A	that would be quite interesting
D	yeah
D	yeah I suppose you can
D	if you've been abused you're
A	no
D	mm
B	there's meant to be five stages
D	yeah
B	you do that in psychology as well
D	mm
A	or a lawyer
D	yeah
A	mm
C	you got to go to university for that though you
C	you need to
A	and law
C	and
B	oh no oh no you don't do law at A Level
C	no
B	no
C	no
A	why?
B	cos they don't like you doing law at A Level
C	they want you to have a good grounding so if you did classics or like classics
A	yeah but I'm not gonna do English I only got a
C	and English
A	got a C in English
C	no but
D	you'd have to go to a university for law wouldn't you?
C	yeah you're gonna
B	yeah so
C	you will have to get a C
D	mm
C	you're gonna have to
A	now I've got a new teacher cos
B	no but you have to
A	yeah I know I think I will er with this other teacher I'm having next year which is not the teacher I have at the moment
B	yeah
D	mm
A	that must be really annoying though
C	you get to it
A	mm
C	and the others you can deal with but the four
D	mm
C	and they cause a and they cause a problem
A	mm
D	yes it's not not that important is it?
C	no
D	no
C	and what they and what you know it's about problem solving and
D	mm
C	but they just no they just do it but why do I need to do it?
D	yeah
C	you know and it and I know full well that
A	what do they not bring?
D	so even if they're doing the GCSE is then they aren't
C	the I don't well GCSE will be a little bit different they don't do GCSE anymore we do something called a
A	yeah but do you not get them to bring food in?
C	no
A	well that's like the problem is isn't it?
C	well
A	like they never provided me with food I always had to bring it in
C	yeah but the problem is
A	yeah but then it's their fault
C	and then it causes
D	yeah
C	then it causes you a problem because
D	absolutely
C	you've got half the class who are
D	mm
C	cooking and half the class that might
D	mm
C	bring their food in and then you have the kids who aren't cooking are messing around because they you know
D	mm
C	you know
A	that must be so expensive though cos you have er like thirty people in each class
C	no we've got groups of twenty
A	well it's
C	our our
D	right
C	and they used to and I used to say
C	yeah
D	I see yeah
E	what is it money?
D	yeah but if comparisons with doing food
E	oh I see yeah
D	yeah
A	that would be like nine thousand a year
C	on just I said
A	for children
C	yeah
E	wow
C	you know and and the boss it's quite interesting cos the boss turned round and said
C	buy it from Tesco's
D	it is
E	yeah
D	often
E	that is
D	yeah
E	you know when I had to help
D	and we had the odd things didn't we from
E	we
D	erm
E	biscuits and stuff
D	yeah
E	they were half the price you could buy them from the wholesalers
C	yeah
D	mm
E	so I used to just put them on the shelf just as a sort of a
C	yeah
D	yeah we went to the wholesalers just cos we thought we could get
C	them dead cheap
D	you
C	yeah
D	it doesn't make sense though does it?
C	it don't
D	I mean
C	no
D	who who actually buys it in the end?
C	yeah yeah
D	small shops? I don't know
C	and you grab your mm yeah okay
D	yeah
A	and you can go to Makro's now can't you?
E	yeah
E	yeah
D	mm
E	but er
D	I don't know
E	Tesco's and Sainsbury's and people like that they they buy
E	about a thousand you know
D	yeah
E	in bulk so they're able to get them cheaper
C	yeah
E	whereas poor old
D	yeah
E	she has to buy it from a wholesaler which is just as expensive as getting them from Tesco's
C	well she's got because she's got to pay the wholesaler for bringing it
E	yeah
D	mm
C	and doing it yeah it's like mum's business used to be
E	yeah
D	yeah
E	has everybody had enough to eat?

D	it's like a ventriloquist but
B	who's got a
E	oh

D	but it
C	not touching it
B	no it's
D	but it
A	it's a fake mouth you can tell it's a fake mouth by the tongue and everything
C	but he's not touching it
A	is it?
D	yeah
A	I thought that was real
E	that's like a bionic mouth is it?
B	yeah it's not a real one it's he's put a cap over it or something
E	right
B	so it's like that and then er he gets it to like open like that
A	yeah
B	cos you can tell by the
D	but it's ventriloquism anyway
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	yeah
D	and it's not not very good I don't think
C	er
E	that ventriloquist
D	but but it didn't sound like a
E	you can see his lips move
D	dog talking did it?
E	that
C	yeah but they just but we don't know what

A	what what happened?
C	well it's interesting that er
E	well they were fiddling
C	bribery
E	Fifa were
D	yeah
E	and you could see that he did it for the purpose
B	yeah cos they have to
A	yeah
B	make it look like they've tried
E	yeah
B	and then make it look like look right
E	yeah
B	yeah
C	oh
B	yeah erm well

C	well er did you see that Hull player punched somebody in Aston Villa?
E	yes punched him in the gut didn't he?
C	yeah
E	he he done it cos I mean everything now is
C	he's got done he's got done
E	he's got done did he?
C	yeah
E	and everything is shown on the television time and time again
D	mm
E	they must have cameras on on their feet on their arms and on their legs all over the place
C	they have
E	yeah
C	erm because some of the stats that have come out this week to do with the footballers on how how far they've run and how many
E	oh yeah
D	yeah?
C	he's been re elected
E	has he?
D	are there cameras on them?
E	yeah they
D	oh
E	I mean their stats now I mean they they can kick a ball from one side of the
D	mm
E	and they they follow that ball and they can tell how fast it is even with cricketers
C	yeah
E	you can they can
D	mm
E	a hundred mile an hour
C	they call it all the time there on cricket
D	yeah
E	yeah
C	what how fast the ball is going and the direction it's gonna go in and everything
E	yeah
C	and slow it down but they were
E	yeah?
E	yeah
