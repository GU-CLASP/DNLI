A	why not hide from the world?
B	it's too bright though
A	I know
A	oh
A	no it is like
B	on Friday yeah
A	Friday
B	yeah
A	erm
B	oh god
A	yeah just before my
B	yeah I think I've got her
A	is that the
B	she's not weird she's just
A	the clinical woman?
B	well just cos I'm a bit you know I'm a bit of a
A	is she young or is she old?
B	erm
A	or like middle aged?
B	I dunno how old she is really like
A	older than forty?
B	no
A	oh no?
B	no I wouldn't say so
A	okay
B	yeah
A	that's not too bad
B	I mean it might be a different person but I I don't really know
A	I think it is
B	erm I'm trying to think how long
A	okay
B	yeah cos I did
A	mm
B	you have to do that
A	okay
B	yeah
A	god I was gonna say cos I was like mm
A	cos sometimes initial assessments take like an hour
B	no I don't think it will
A	I don't think it will
B	well even if it does you still have time to like
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	anyway I'm fine let's talk about
B	no no I didn't mean it I didn't mean I wasn't silence
A	no?
B	I just like I don't know what to fucking say to be honest like
A	no yeah
B	I'd rather talk about you to be honest
A	hey then if we talk about me it's gonna ignore all of your shit and then
B	I don't care I wanna ignore all my shit
A	it's not gonna happen
A	you shouldn't ignore the shit because purely you want to
B	no but I also care about what
A	I
B	well
A	why?
B	because
A	it's stupid of you to care more about me
A	I'm not a lost
A	I thought I was a lost cause for like
B	you're not you're not a lost cause
A	I don't think you are a lost cause
B	mm
A	despite it you've felt like this for a long time doesn't mean you're
B	mm
A	you know?
B	yeah
A	cos I guess I guess it is easier if say like
A	and you've had a lot of time
B	mm
A	so like not doing is the norm
A	because
B	yeah
A	horrible because you can't do anything
B	I know I I'm really wanted to like
A	oh
B	but it just
A	it's not stupid
B	cos I mean I do think like that and it's fine cos I don't
A	cos it affects it it all affects your brain yeah
B	I know
B	it really does it must do because it's just like
A	cos if you think about it like
B	yeah
A	it's a disability like
B	mm
A	you know?
A	and you have to keep trying
B	yeah
A	which is really horrible isn't it because like?
B	I feel like it's my fault and I don't know whether that is true or not
A	it's not your fault
B	like I really don't any more
A	I mean from the outside
B	I think it is
A	but it's how is it your how is your fault that you feel like this?
B	I don't know because this is just how I am like I've just this is just my personality now it's not even
A	I think you can be a cynical person
A	and be able to get out of bed and be able to feel able to do things I don't think
B	yeah
A	like it might help
B	I mean it was stressful in a different way like it was
A	yeah yeah
B	erm the stakes are a lot higher
A	yeah yeah
B	you know if I get
A	mm
B	you know there's a lot of money involved here and there are a lot of serious
A	oh god
B	important things involved here
A	mm
B	and that did upset me but it didn't
A	do they want you to do really well or do they just want you to do stuff all the time?
A	is that what?
B	they want me to do well up here cos they think I can
A	mm
B	they think I have it in me and I really don't
A	it isn't
B	it
A	cos it's not that you're not capable of getting
B	yeah
A	that isn't
A	and maybe when you actually start getting like proper regular help
B	no but that's just not happening here it's just not happening it's like I
A	mm
A	to actually?
B	no
A	why?
B	well cos
A	mm
B	and that's the problem like
A	oh my god
B	and
A	that's crazy
B	it's just straight back to square one and it's really frustrating
A	oh god
B	and it's like why would you put it at the end of the week you know? it's just fucking stupid
A	leave?
B	to leave
A	yeah
B	and also like
A	what's the sort of thing she asks you to do?
A	mm
B	it's not what I want
A	I think
B	yeah
A	like
B	I feel like I've messed it up way too much I really have done a really good job of fucking stuff up for myself so far
A	and it can still be
B	I don't think it can
A	I think it can
B	I
A	I think it
A	you've not gone to your lectures because you felt depressed
B	yeah
A	they're horrible problems but they're common
B	yeah
A	erm I'm sure a degree level student
B	well that's the point of first year isn't it?
A	mm
B	to be
A	exactly
A	like obviously you've gotta get the forty percent pass mark but I think it allows you a bit of leeway to like
B	yeah
B	and I have this intense fear of just
A	I know
B	thinking it's awful because I just that's what I think like every time I read anything I've ever written I hate it
A	have has it always felt like that?
A	mm
B	that I can't read my own essays I can't do it
A	no same
B	I've never actually read one
A	mm
B	I physically like I
A	tense yeah
B	and I can't look at it
A	mm cos it it
A	you would well not been good enough for it
B	yeah
A	like cos in my head I feel like I'm not good enough but also I've got this other expectation of you can't
A	the good thing is though like
A	I know I've been saying this all along but
B	yeah
A	it's
A	a new
B	yeah
A	cos we have quite a lot of contact like do you feel like you've got quite a lot of contact hours?
B	yeah
A	so
B	and then you also have all the group stuff as well
A	mm
B	it feels like contact hours to me cos you have to go with your group
A	I mean it
B	oh that is annoying yeah
A	the worry about the
A	mm
B	but I mean there's no way around that I can't just stamp my feet and be like I don't wanna do it I can't
A	is this gonna be every week for the whole year?
B	I don't know I don't I think so
A	or at the moment because
B	yeah
A	like you'd expect maybe a few times in the year but not every week I mean that is a big ask
B	yeah
A	I mean
B	yeah
A	with English you don't seem to feel like that like you don't even wanna do it
B	no
A	like do you think there's
B	yeah
A	as in like you'd maybe oh yeah I
B	well this is what I thought English would be
A	be your that'd be your subject yeah
B	yeah that I would be able to
A	mm
B	but it just hasn't happened yet
A	mm
B	for me
A	does your mind
B	and I can't
A	oh yeah
B	and there's nothing else is there?
A	does your mind feel a bit like foggy
B	yeah
A	can't learn?
B	mm
A	because
B	yeah
A	and I think actually medication might help you
B	yeah
A	like you're you're driving through a mist rather than like a thick fog
B	mm
A	like it's still obviously there but it's not as like
B	I'm so glad you get the fog thing cos I
A	yeah oh my god
B	I say that to my sister and my mum and they're like and they just don't get it
A	no
A	but it it it feels like you've just been
A	forty years
A	that is how I feel
B	yeah
A	quite a lot of the time
B	I get that as well
B	yeah
A	and it's horrible and oh
B	I was on
A	okay
B	and then
A	a little row?
B	well not really it was just more of me like just no knowing what to say to her any more
A	mm
B	and like
A	it's not your fault
B	that's why I feel bad about it
A	because
B	you know like these conversations?
A	you you have people that love and that's not your fault
A	you've not done anything to them
B	yeah
A	but you haven't actually done anything wrong
A	and it's because they care and they want you to have the best time and they want the best view
B	I really wish I could just try for them like if I'm not trying for myself
A	yeah
B	I wish I could do it for them but I just don't feel like
A	yeah
A	do you know how I found?
B	yeah
A	I feel like
B	yeah
A	very like my reactions are very kinda like
B	yeah I get that
B	yeah like sometimes when I might do just
A	mm
B	myself
A	mm
B	I just like it's not like I like
A	no
B	it's just I have like no feeling about it
A	mm
B	and I just watch it happen
A	mm?
B	after that
A	it's just a killer isn't it? like it's horrible
B	yeah
A	well don't say that because it's gonna be worse for everyone
A	like don't don't compare
B	that's how that's what it's like
A	I know
A	I know
B	and just
A	I don't think you're self absorbed like even if you were it wouldn't be
B	mm
A	it would be part of the illness but I don't think that's your problem I think you just don't care about anything including yourself
B	yeah
A	mm
B	well as well like if
A	mm
B	I don't leave myself to kind of rot away in my room
A	I mean
B	no
A	function it's
B	no
A	more of your cage you know?
B	mm
A	it's not the
B	yeah
A	and
B	and it's weird cos most of the time I was like well not most of the time but some of the time I'm completely normal and
A	exactly like that
B	think
A	it does feel like you're a fraud
B	yeah
A	that you're not
B	I'm sorry if it makes it difficult to talk about with you cos
A	no
B	cos I know that my friend doesn't cos she's had it before and she just doesn't like talking about it any more
A	I mean I can it actually is a relief to me that you can relate to everything that I'm saying
B	yeah
A	because
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	and I felt able to do thing
B	yeah
A	and I've been
B	do you think it's the med?
A	no
B	oh that's good
A	I obviously I think
B	yeah
A	they
B	yeah
A	it cannot be worse by
B	yeah
A	and feel even more of a failure because I'll never know what I actually would've got in the
B	mm
A	train it to work again
B	yeah
A	like see it as
A	it is because there's I think there's a danger of like making yourself do too much
B	yeah
A	but also too little as well like you can
B	yeah
A	which and I think independence when you're depressed can be the most damaging thing you know?
A	oh wow
A	come all the where to
B	that they would actually just come to my room and start like
A	they are
B	cos they just expect you to keep up with your email account every day and it's like I don't
A	I always get really scared like
B	yeah like you know I said that my physics thing wasn't on my timetable my seminar?
A	yeah
B	it turns out they sent an email round yesterday saying that oh it is actually on I don't know why it's not on the
A	what the physics?
B	the physics seminar
A	I was thinking that
B	and I didn't get that email until like today
A	oh well you shouldn't've known well
B	cos I hadn't looked
A	mm
B	but it's just a pain now cos I'm I've got another absence and
A	are you sure you need attendance for that?
A	what were you gonna use the grand for like accommodation or food for this year just for this year?
B	well just everything it was just for like
A	mm
A	that sucks
B	yeah so if I don't get that I'm gonna be so fucked
A	is there any way you can get?
A	oh you're in
B	well no my my student account's with
A	okay
B	I've got an overdraft
A	do they charge interest for overdraft?
B	but
A	no?
B	no I would be able to use my overdraft but I'd have to pay it off at the end and it would
A	mm
B	yeah I don't know I suppose I could use my overdraft dip in dip into that
A	is it the same with all banks then like all banks?
B	yeah they don't charge interest with student accounts usually
A	student banks?
B	yeah
A	that's really I thought they did
B	and I get I get fourteen hundred overdraft which is pretty decent
A	okay
B	so
A	is this for Coop then?
B	yeah Coop
A	I've not got a student bank account I've just got a normal one
B	have you not?
A	yeah
B	oh my god why not?
A	so I have cos my parents were like don't get a student account
B	we should've done though cos you get you get an overdraft and it's completely free
A	and how long can you have the overdraft for?
B	well it's for this year and then it gets it
A	so I can have one grand overdraft this year?
B	I get fourteen hundred overdraft
A	wow
B	on my current account and
A	okay
B	most accounts do that
A	fourteen grand?
B	well no not fourteen grand like one thousand four hundred
A	oh okay
A	wow okay
B	perhaps they get fourteen grand imagine
B	well you have to
A	three years or
B	when you're in your overdraft you just pay
A	okay
B	but
A	sorted
B	then you just pay it off next year or get a job over summer and that's
A	oh okay so there's no like deadline to the end of this year you have to pay it or something?
B	no no no
A	okay
B	like what you've gone over and it's usually only a couple of quid anyway
A	yeah
B	and then they don't charge you
B	so it's like really good
B	to get an overdraft like it's really
A	mm
B	have trouble with like paying
B	I can't believe you don't have an overdraft
A	no cos my parents are like don't even bother with overdrafts and student accounts but I was like okay
B	really?
A	it's just yeah
B	dips into their overdraft
A	yeah
B	it's just
A	I'll definitely make that on my agenda then to
B	yeah
A	convert it because if my thingy comes through I'll need it
B	yeah I didn't think about it you could use that yeah definitely
A	might be able to do it
B	yeah to like use it for your
A	mm
B	no it's definitely a good idea and then you just pay it back over summer
A	mm
B	and it takes like not very long usually
A	okay
B	to pay it back
A	wow
B	well then you just have
A	and overdraft then
B	and it will just roll over
A	okay
A	right
B	well no no cos I think my sister's actually in overdraft and you just kind of stay in overdraft until you pay it off
A	that's cool
A	that's fair enough then
B	I mean it's yeah it's fair enough like it's if you don't pay it back you just don't
A	I'll look on the
B	mm
A	if it's one thousand four hundred
B	let's have a look
A	let's see
B	you're
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	screw you know what screw your parents
B	what I got mine last year cos you get a free
A	yeah yeah
B	but it's just easier cos what I do I just pay myself a hundred pounds a week
A	oh yeah?
B	like my building society so I know exactly how much money I can spend a week
A	mm
B	then I don't end up spending over
A	right
B	upgrade existing account
A	yeah
B	erm
A	up to two thousand?
B	yeah
A	term one
B	yeah that isn't that? doesn't that mean year?
A	I thought it meant
B	I'm not sure
A	cos I I think cos your loan
A	it
B	oh
A	it is
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah to keep the overdraft you have pay at least seven hundred fifty every six months
A	yeah
B	just by having
A	mm mm
B	yeah
A	three months
B	yeah exactly
A	and how do you undo your student account like how do you stop it being a student account? do you just like change it back?
B	erm I think you just have to ring them up
A	change it back
B	yeah
B	like separate that's what I've got
A	okay
B	quite good because it means that it's like separate so all your student money is separate and you just pay yourself what you get
A	okay
B	like your allowance and then the rest of it's all just in another account and you don't have to worry about it
A	that's really good
B	like automatically like you set up automatic payments to the like the uni and to
A	mm
B	student finance and whatever
A	that's cool
B	and if you did that you might get more overdraft
A	do some people have it all in the same one?
B	I mean yeah yeah some people do yeah
A	mm
B	I dunno cos
A	yeah you've got yours in separate I'm sure that's a good way of doing it actually like
B	I'm sure
A	the way you're doing it
B	I'm sure people do have it in
A	so you have to apply for an overdraft then?
B	erm
A	okay
B	a big kind of thing like it's really easy to get
A	it's not like oh yeah you need this yeah
B	no
A	that's cool
B	I mean
A	that's really cool
B	mm
A	yeah I will I'll change it to
B	to just change it yeah
A	simpler just yeah
B	yeah just sign in and muck about and see what they say
A	cos then I don't have to worry about
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	until you could like pay it back yeah
A	I found that the price of our
B	bloody hell
A	that's what I mean so
B	oh
A	but yeah
B	mm
A	that's looks like a
B	it does
B	I was wanting to go shopping today I was gonna get potatoes and mash and make like
A	oh were you?
B	toad in the hole but I didn't go shopping in the end
A	yeah it's
B	mm
A	I've still got my frigging
B	what?
A	my erm revision Powerpoints
B	oh
A	go through
B	revision for what? have you got another exam?
A	well basically
B	oh yeah I remember you said that
A	to print
B	that's a good idea
A	when I go home so I can
B	are you going home next week?
A	I don't know
B	mm
A	I might go home next week
B	there's still time
A	yeah there is still time
B	go back home?
A	mm
B	yeah
A	or in a way
B	yeah
A	mm
B	mm am I actually gonna make it till then?
A	what at the
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	like cos I could go this week cos I haven't got anything on
A	you could do
B	but then I've gotta hand in essays and stuff so it's like
A	oh
B	mm
A	no yeah
B	but I dunno whether to go to the doctor's and get an
A	you could do you could do that
B	oh I don't know
A	I mean
B	mm
A	you can get a doctor's note
B	mm
A	you'd just be kind of
B	yeah
A	mm
B	and then come back
A	do you feel like
B	no I don't think so but I mean I am aware that I need to make change myself
A	mm
B	like I'm not
A	yeah
B	like so I understand that I have to go and seek help
A	mm
B	and I feel like I've done that to a certain extent
A	which is great
B	I've just kinda missed the appointment like
A	mm
B	which is really annoying cos it's like this week that's everything's happening but
A	if you're still here then?
B	yeah I don't know I'm just talking in terms of like
A	is this
B	yeah
A	right
B	it's just like a little
A	mm
B	it's not an easy thing for you to do
A	no
B	just
A	but when you get out of the routine it is a lot harder like
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah exactly
B	oh I dunno
A	but I I you are hashtag relatable
A	you very much you are even though it's shit for you
B	me too
A	cos you
B	yeah
A	like your head is kinda like on my
B	well it just I think it just shows really that it is an illness
A	that it isn't yeah exactly it's not just like
B	you know it's not it's not in my head
B	cos it's so
A	exactly
B	you know?
A	exactly
B	secondary thing happening
A	and a lot of symptoms of depression are symptoms of laziness and can't be arsed
B	yeah
A	so
B	and that's the problem
A	you know?
B	that's like that's the massive problem with it
A	yeah that's why it's so stigmatised
B	fucking ridiculous
A	too anxious to be lazy
B	yeah
A	sometimes I think I'm calm but I'm not
B	yeah
B	I'm just like bubbling under the surface all the time
A	mm
B	pretty much that I don't get angry
A	mm
A	yeah
B	I don't know
A	just to check that it's happy
B	it's kinda just like a habit it's just
A	sometimes you even play with your phone when you're nervous it's like
B	yeah
A	the equivalent of
B	I'm so awful when I'm nervous I like playing with everything like I was just
A	I used to like draw grids like craaaaa
B	did you?
A	and that's actually quite common actually it's not
B	yeah
A	like yeah
B	no I've head that one my auntie told me about that one
A	if
B	money signs
A	mm
B	that's what I doodle
A	your your priorities
B	yes
A	or is that anxieties over money or?
B	money
A	dreams of money or
B	yeah
A	richness
B	I was reading up a
A	yeah
B	bags and perfume and all of this stuff
A	yeah
B	and she didn't have sex with him
A	yeah
B	she just
A	that's yeah
B	has intellectual
A	they just wanted company they're just lonely and they've got so much money
B	yeah
A	like me seriously me
B	I wanna do that
B	yeah
A	we sat in
B	yeah
A	and
A	or like we'll just
B	can we use that
A	everyone
B	yeah
A	and the thing was last year like there's loads of them like near
B	yeah I bet
A	but here it's like
B	yeah you wouldn't get
A	it's
B	you could go to London
A	you'd get a sugar sheep
B	but they
A	yeah and they can take you on like
A	when you look on their profiles it's crazy like I'm looking for someone who I can treat and travel the world with and it's like
B	yeah it's ridiculous like why would
A	wow
B	well it's very nice of them and
B	if I was more confident I would definitely do it like
A	and some rich people give students loans
B	yeah this one she said she erm he paid off her entire overdraft
A	on websites
B	just straightaway
A	that's crazy
B	I know he just paid it off
A	you could just do that and never speak to them again as harsh as it would be
B	I know exactly and that's what she did she like she just completely cut off from everyone after a month cos she was like right my social life's kind of getting
A	I'm so doing this
B	but it was just such a good month cos she had so much money
A	they buy you presents
B	and she was
A	no
B	like she told her family
A	I mean
B	and it's got
A	no exactly I mean you're doing them a service
B	yeah exactly if they want it
A	like you're in control
B	exactly
A	position like it's not
B	and she didn't feel like ever that she was trapped into it like she felt like she
A	opt out and mm
B	yeah
A	no
B	most of the time
A	that's the thing
B	cos they're old enough and they usually have families as well like they usually have wives and stuff they just want to like talk about their day
A	that's really kinda sad isn't it?
B	it is it's really quite
A	like
B	it's quite tragic really for them
A	they must be so desperate like if they're willing to spend that much on company
B	they must be quite lonely
A	and sure
B	well then but money to them isn't the same thing as what it would be to us like
A	mm
B	cos it's
A	money's probably just money like
B	yeah
A	it comes and goes like the grass and the rain and
B	yeah
A	trees
B	imagine just
A	yeah
B	it's insane
A	like Kardashians have is it
B	mm
A	like four hundred and eighty million?
A	wow
B	kind of admire them though cos they've done it all themselves
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	you know why shouldn't they exploit themselves through reality
B	hundred percent
A	yeah I I I don't have a problem with
B	they're businesswomen
A	Kardashians to be honest like
B	no
A	I don't watch the Kardashians but like
B	no
A	I don't everyone's like oh I hate them I'm like I don't hate them
B	no
A	done nothing wrong
B	they're like the royal family except they've done it all themselves
A	they really are
B	aren't they?
A	they are better than the royal family and that
B	yeah
A	in so many respects
B	they're business people like they've
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	they're not just born into wealth you know?
B	exactly
A	yeah yeah
B	doing something I can't remember
A	me too
B	yeah
A	it's
B	that's kind of good really cos that's what you want like you don't wanna
A	yeah
B	you know really spoilt and
A	it's just I'd like to be comfortable and not have that on my mind
A	it buys everything
B	assurance that you're not gonna
A	mm
B	you don't have enough money for things
A	I know
B	and it would just yeah
A	yeah pretty much
A	mm
B	cos I'd have enough money to do
A	my god imagine that though
B	and I wouldn't mind paying extra tax cos I'd deserve to like yeah I've got more money
A	no
B	well that's the thing cos now I'm like so scared about buying anything like I don't buy very much
A	I'd go travelling
B	I'd just find it so precious
A	I'd spend it on experiences like I'd like to do stuff like
B	yeah
A	I know it sounds strange but like
B	mm
A	and just have experiences but I'd also like a home
B	oh
A	not like quite Paris Hilton's
A	but that is incredible
A	have like a
B	oh
A	come in and look after them and I'd
B	yeah I think I would buy my mum
A	you selfless little
B	no but wouldn't you? no you'd buy your mum a house
A	I dunno
B	that's like
A	I dunno
B	understandable
A	yeah yeah
B	that's fine
A	I mean I I'd like to help with my family to be honest cos they have like
B	yeah
A	I dunno
B	that sounds really annoyingly selfless but I don't think I can't think of anything else that I would do before that like that's really important to me
A	and I suppose like with your mum as well like
A	because
B	it would just be good cos she'd just have a house and she wouldn't have to worry about it ever again
A	mm
B	it's in a good location you wouldn't get it these days
A	imagine if we won the lottery
B	oh
A	like sixteen million pounds or whatever like
A	did you know?
B	yeah I heard that once
A	than actually winning
B	I know it's so depressing
A	it is
B	er
A	somebody I know in my school their family
B	that's amazing for them
A	it's brilliant yeah
B	yeah
A	they live a completely different life now to the way they did it's
A	really strange
B	yeah
A	couldn't've gone to anyone better to be honest
B	what happens if the lottery like gets won by someone who's already got
A	yeah
B	and it's just
A	it's not they can't really take it away from them it's yeah
B	mm
A	yeah
B	luck of the draw
A	I think it is like
B	but then they could cos they'd have the money to
A	they could
B	you know?
A	but I think more
B	cos that's another thing you have to pay to enter it and it's
A	yeah
B	you know if you entered it a lot of times you'd have more chance
A	I
A	horrible business
B	doing what?
A	lottery tickets
B	really?
A	like every now and then yeah
B	I've never bought one
A	I might do it
B	I've never actually bought one it's quite weird cos I'm so obsessed with money but I've never bought a lottery ticket or a scratch card or anything
A	I've bought a few
