A	okay so I started for my project I wanted to do something completely different from what I ended up doing
B	I know Minecraft
A	and em
B	yeah
A	I did a Google search for one of my lecturers and eh managed to find a video of him eh talking to someone sort of for an  for an  event
B	oh right
A	and he was talking about the concept that he was exploring in his art work
B	yeah I see yeah
A	and and imitate works of art and bits of culture that that's quite local to them
B	oh right so you sort of get
A	yeah
B	oh right
A	just to explore what it was to to get obsessed
B	oh wow
A	in eh on on the server
B	wow
A	and I got a bit of help in in the building but it was quite a complex design
B	how long did it take to actually make em you know the the the actual statue itself?
A	em well the first time I in in designing it in Mine craft you've got a thing call creative mode work that allows you to fly around and you have infinite resources
B	yeah mods
A	yeah he he was a mod so
B	yeah
A	so he he was basically in creative so he could give me all the resources that I needed
B	yeah you know
A	yeah well it was just sort of combining those ideas
B	yeah
A	then it's not em it it lights up when you tread on it but it doesn't produce enough light for the eh monsters to not spawn
B	oh I see no you're right okay
A	yeah so I I decided it would be a good idea to have this massive arena made out of red stone
B	mm
A	and close it off so that the sunlight didn't get on it so these monsters would spawn in this arena
B	big arena kind of thing
A	yeah it it's really quite striking
B	oh wow
A	out to this place
B	love it
A	and eh em the the creepers em don't burn in the sunlight
B	excellent
A	so yeah yeah that was  that was  a much more em positive project that actually worked out quite well
B	yeah it's quite nice when you see it sort of evolve as well
A	yeah
B	cos I guess it's something
A	yeah yeah
B	yeah
A	and you'd have your eh your enchanting table and your your forge and your brewery and stuff where everyone could just use these resources
B	it's kind of like a virtual communist state
A	yeah yeah it really was
B	oh wow
A	and eh
B	yeah
A	and then eventually I think round about the Christmas holidays the whole place just got completely burnt to shit
B	oh no
A	there was lava
B	it's just mankind isn't it?
A	yeah it was just really really weird and he  and he  sent a sort of statement to the
B	oh no
A	so I guess that's my own bloody fault but em
B	Jesus
A	so in the next map I hope that I killed him before he'd figured out he could do that
B	yeah
A	and it caused him to just just go completely the other direction as well
B	oh they actually did versions of it?
A	em well when Minecraft one point zero was released there was MineCon which was the em the sort of convention in eh Las Vegas
B	yeah
A	and the group who were televising it were recording everything and stuff em were wearing occupy Minecraft t-shirts
B	mm
A	and there was an example that that really inspired me in the first place of em a YouTube channel where they em eh this this guy who presents the show eh gets everyone on his Minecraft server to to build over the course of a week or a month to em on a certain subject
B	oh excellent
A	and eh they did one em Far East they did one of underwater worlds they did one of the future
B	oh wow
A	and making it sort of expanding the world and and really making it a bit more international
B	so he had to destroy it
A	yeah
B	read Lord of the Flies
A	all all came round like that
B	yeah
A	he has built these massive projects and it they haven't been as collaborative as they were before so
