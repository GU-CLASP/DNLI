B	so what's someone said about me?
A	I don't know there's nothing much there's nothing like I'm trying to think of anything in particular but really
B	a bit? when?
A	er like if if something's like related I'll be like oh
B	mm
A	that would sound weird if you always said like no I don't really know I'm trying to think but there's there's nothing like
B	that's rubbish I hope you're like your machine thing is
A	yeah of course it would be er there's nothing negative that I can think of
B	yeah it's got to be someone stupid to er do that but you know
A	mm
B	it's got to be someone stupid to complain about me in front of you
A	I'll join in what are you talking about?
B	shut it oh god nobody ever done this but
A	I don't talk to anyone who dislikes you so
B	is that a solidarity thing or?

B	I
A	I don't think there's nothing in particular there's nothing like big I don't we don't just sit there and like right let's discuss
B	right
A	discuss you in
B	right right I thought you'd never ask
A	yeah no okay wrong person to say really
A	he'd get all these notebooks out I have so much to say about him
B	where shall we start eighth of January?
A	I wrote down
A	just figured you'd take his name
B	I listened to erm Frank Skinner and someone changed their name to erm they don't watch Star Wars and stuff but he said he knew someone once who changed his name to Darth Vader
A	yeah
B	erm and he was like why why did you do that? he was like I think someone just told me to do it and I don't really like Star Wars but I did it erm
B	erm I I forgot the reason why I did it but there actually there was a reason my friend told me to do it for this reason
A	yeah
B	and then erm this thing had like a time period and he's like right so you're you're going to you're going to change it back now? and he went erm no I quite like it
A	quite like it
B	I'm just going to be called Darth Vader now
A	quite like it now
B	but l I didn't even like the movies I just call myself Darth Vader
A	just like the name well that's fair enough
B	not been talked about ever?
A	no I can't remember well not to me anyway I literally can't remember anything where it's been like where it's just been like one straight thing like like about your personality or about you
B	it's personality
A	it's it's always something like oh
A	and that's it it's nothing it's not like can't remember anything like that
B	mm
A	sorry sorry to disappoint you
B	oh I wanted like
A	I know yeah but I've not got anything
B	hot goss
A	me and
B	apart from
A	even though that was like well god that was like a year ago year ago year and a bit ago now
B	oh whatever
A	no no I don't say it to her
B	you you just like
A	I say
B	oh no
A	no
B	I guess
A	I guess
B	that's not a fair
A	I said that now because I had too many now what has she done?
B	oh no
A	I have too many now
A	ah how many she's had like
B	oh now she's going to get your thumbs pounding the screen
A	she had like three or something erm but yeah she'll ask me stuff like that she she ask she like gets me to rank you all
B	what? never?
A	no
B	what? oh I I've been I guess
A	cos you expect it cos you yeah but I've I've said that I guess now because you're here because you're too big-headed about it all so I have to say
B	but I know I know I know I'm number one I'm definitely ranked number one
B	yes I know who's one
A	so it's like yeah you and then it's like and then she's like
A	I'm like yeah I guess I guess
B	game's over
A	no yeah I was like I don't know now I was like
B	run out of friends
A	problem is I'll be like well you do yours but I I I I don't mean it nasty like I don't mean this in any like weird way at all but she's only got two friends
A	ah see I do I don't mean it in anyway but she's only got like two like proper friends at home she said that's what she says to me
B	that is quite sad
A	she says that so that's not me saying it but she's like you know I've only got two friends and then and I'm not going to rank them and I was like okay well do you not see it's weird you asking me to like rank my friends?
B	maybe she wants you to talk about your friends so because she doesn't have any friends to think about
A	mm mm
B	so she thinks about friends via the proxy of you
A	don't say that on tape the proxy of you it's weird like she's cos she's I just found it weird I was like I don't really do that I don't really like think of it in that way but okay
A	why do you need to know this? so weird
B	she said writing it down
A	I know yeah I know yeah why do you need to know? you're just like and then I've got I I can't get rid of this and I don't know how to I'm sure there's a way of getting rid of it but when we're watching stuff on my laptop if I get a Facebook message it pops up on my
B	yeah I'm sure there's a way
A	I know and I must I've tried to but there must be something
B	and the one where it's like erm
A	oh no that's that never mind
B	like presentation setting or something so when you're in full screen mode nothing will pop up
A	okay okay cos yeah we sat
B	that'll teach you for watching I'm a Celebrity
B	yeah yeah you can like quick before it goes
A	yeah yeah yeah but I mean it's nothing and
A	I was like I can't I
B	like you should have said her
A	yeah I was like I'm not lying we didn't talk about you at all and and I make I mean I don't I don't talk about her very much anyway I know I do here I feel awful actually cos I've been talking about her quite a bit here but at uni I really don't like and especially if she's in the house I'm not mentioning her name cos she'll be like at the door
A	too dangerous
B	you don't er you don't shit where you sleep?
B	eat ah you don't want to shit where you sleep either
A	no yeah that's true but at the same time I like I don't talk about either of them in the house I don't talk about like I don't want to talk about

B	no erm it's too broad you're basically
A	exactly yeah but there's no
B	but there's no you you like just say to be better you've got no way to improve yourself
A	yeah I do cos I know the improvements I have to make I just don't want to list them all
B	well there you go you need to list them
A	why?
B	funny
A	for who? no
A	not funny they're not really funny
B	what what what's number one three and five?
A	oh god I haven't I haven't listed them you've just told me to list them so one okay will be to
B	rank them they already are ranked
A	we'll do no cos I'm just thinking now er
B	strange
A	shut up
B	oh
A	okay so one will be to stop like stop bitching probably be a better
B	stop bitching oh what?
A	mm
B	like not to me though hopefully
B	okay so more about other people?
A	no no see I don't mean it like that
B	you get to balance the you have to address the balance somehow
A	no no I don't erm cos I feel awful cos they cos
A	I do you just
B	it's about you
A	you just don't no it's I don't I don't I've not said anything particularly bad about
B	see
A	so yeah of course yeah sorry I feel a bit bad cos I keep mentioning them er they we go number two is to stop mentioning
B	it's alright it's funny though
A	be funny you don't know them
B	it's fine to bitch to people I think when they have no idea who they are
A	that's why I like doing it
B	yeah yeah
A	cos it's it's because at least you don't know them but then it makes them look really bad to you even though they're really nice people so
B	but I'm probably never going to meet them
A	no it's true
B	cos you went to uni that was like so far away
A	yeah see don't get oh don't get me started on that
B	you're having a conversation with yourself I'm not sure
A	I know I'm not a dweller too much anyway so I think I can leave that
B	you're a cave dweller
A	no I dwell on those type of things I would dwell on embarrassing things that happen to me though I dwell on that for a long time
B	oh what's going on? what are you moaning about?
A	I don't even know
B	you're dwelling on this what you what I just said
A	yeah sorry what what what are you asking?
B	something about being too far away I said that and you were like oh don't say that
A	no it's just because I think I've said this at
B	I wasn't very drink
B	please include me in this conversation
A	okay
B	this tape wants a er a conversation between people not not
A	yeah see I feel like I'm deep delving too deep for this tape
B	not at all they've got loads probably going to listen to tapes like
A	judge me
B	for a lot a lot of this time it'll be it'll be good for them there some juicy goss
A	juicy goss I hope they don't know anyone I haven't mentioned any second names so that's fine erm
B	as if they're gonna facebook them
A	they might just know them
A	no shut up
A	erm
A	okay you're singing now so it doesn't matter
B	do you know who this is? we'll get back to you in a minute but
A	yeah is it guy on his own or is it Busted?
B	well no it's not Busted but
A	oh
B	Charlie Simpson
A	I was gonna say the guy on his own the like middle guy that's what his name was the one who's now joined again he like wasn't in it was he? like in the Busted like redo and then he's joined it now
B	has he?
A	yeah yeah
B	yeah so he's a member of Fightstar he's called Charlie Simpson and then
A	so he's official
B	right but he he just released a new album with his like rock metal band
A	I don't know I don't know but they're back
B	they're back
A	they're back it only happened recently but they are back
B	it it it's probably just a tour though isn't it? not er
A	yeah oh yeah it's not yeah not forever it must be like a
B	for the
A	yeah yeah it's like yeah it's like a
B	must be weird though cos I listened to some of his like Fightstar stuff and it's like proper heavy stuff
A	yeah
B	he's like screaming and everything innit?
B	so it's like he must find it weird
A	maybe that that's probably why he left then cos he wanted to do this kind of music can't really do that with
B	yeah well yeah yeah mm
A	I wasn't it wasn't like being too far away it was just knowing what I know now if I had the choice of universities again I don't think I would have picked
B	what because of the distance away from here or because it's got nothing there?
A	no it's not even I dunno it's it's nothing to do with that it's just it's just I don't think if I knew what I wanted to actually do like if I knew I'd wanted to do like language and linguistics or just linguistics I just don't think I would have picked
B	existential crisis
A	yeah
B	that's good
A	it's just a simple I probably wouldn't be there I told
B	who knows?
A	yeah dunno hopefully I would be giving
A	it's weird when I think about how I got to
B	yeah I remember talking to you and I I remember coming away from it just thinking like I don't I've no idea what she wants to do
A	no exactly cos I didn't know so
B	mm
A	and so and obviously then I picked a course that I didn't want to do in the end so it's still still ended up in me changing so
A	but er it's just weird
B	mm
A	but I guess I guess knowing that knowing how
B	yeah I suppose like first year you've been away and it's
A	exactly yeah
B	I'm pretty sure my first time I came kind of like for a weekend I don't think I needed it because like the back

B	er
A	yep
B	and I know someone who erm put a tweet when is on the way to erm I forget where it was it was somewhere in Africa
A	yeah

A	right
B	this is a joke about as you can get
A	yeah yeah
B	erm and she she did that before she got on the flight and she turned her phone off
A	mm
B	turned it back on again all these it had been retweeted by loads of people and they were like hating her cos they didn't get the joke but she was joking about her own erm like white erm
A	yeah yeah
B	what's it called?
A	I know I'm trying to think now white
B	er
A	privilege
B	that's it I knew it was a P word
A	you're a P word
B	er and
A	mm
B	so
A	difficult
B	really?
A	yeah he follow that's the only reason I follow him is he followed me first I don't know why but okay
B	your plug is good
A	I know yeah I was going to say cos I don't when tweet anything do you can't I can't even accredit it to me like doing stuff cos I really I don't even tweet apart from like
B	no maybe he likes the jokes from
A	I know yeah he must do so he followed me so I followed him back he's called Matt Hague and I have I have I've not I've not read any of his books but I've heard of them and I do intend to read them but but I intend to read a lot of books and erm so he and he tweets quite a bit about one of his books was ten reasons to stay alive and he tweets quite a bit about like you know dealing with depression and stuff not like overly just every so often he'll put out a little thing and then and then the other day he was tweeting about how much abuse he gets like on
B	I know
A	that's why I think it's funny if people like pay attention to mine cos it's literally just stupid joke after stupid joke after stupid joke
B	yeah I think like if it happened to me it would just be so easy to be well fuck doing it
A	yeah yeah
B	and I hope
A	yeah but yeah but I really love cos him and and I love you know Patrick Ness I really one of things I really love even though I don't retweet them that much I guess this is my in-between is retweeting authors erm I really love following authors on Twitter really love it cos most of the time they've got something really great to say and er and so I adore it and then when they talk about hate I'm like stop it stop being mean to these lovely authors
A	these lovely people yeah talk about how much hate they get and stuff and how much abuse and I'm just like they're lovely people read their books
A	especially J K Rowling I love J K Rowling but she gets pure abuse on Twitter
B	yeah I can imagine
A	and it's like so awful but but she always says just such wonderful things that I'm like yes I love you so much
B	this is like about like erm black Hermione and she's like yeah she was always black
A	she didn't say that
B	well yeah but words to that effect but like yeah she was just like
A	no she just said she just said I didn't write her as anything she's not in the book she's just described as brown hair and brown eyes
B	well you could say that about anything I guess cos has she ever said that
A	oh okay yeah I don't think they are no apart from Voldemort
B	surely surely most of the characters are white well yeah
A	but yeah yeah
B	I'm sure more of the characters aren't erm
A	yeah I guess yeah
B	it's like you can tell that
A	I don't even know whether she it annoyed me so much people getting annoyed about that
B	it was strange yeah
A	I'm like I'm like no it's nothing to get annoyed about you weirdos it's nothing when they showed it I didn't even
B	oh is he not?
A	I was like why is
B	he's really old
A	that's written yeah no yeah I figure maybe he's grown out of his ginger hairs
B	he got so abused
A	I know I was just like that's the first thing I went to was just like why is
B	he's eleven years old so
A	but then but then he tweeted being like he's ginger at heart and I was just like
B	at heart come on
A	no he isn't
B	I reckon they forgot they've gone oh shit he is ginger
A	yeah yeah cos the whole family is ginger it's just something you can't really get passed
B	no yeah
A	cos the whole Weasley fan
B	odd
A	but yeah they are older I think the story is set a bit later
B	oh okay
A	I can't remember I honestly can't remember I haven't read it so
B	is it a film?
A	is it a film or just a play? is it a West End play?
B	I thought it was a play yeah
A	mm is it? she has written it
B	I I know who he is but I don't know what Luther is yeah
A	yeah never mind it doesn't it doesn't matter I just thought Luther might be something you've watched that's all
B	about him being James Bond?
A	I think he'd make a fantastic James Bond when I when I
B	yeah that's what I thought too
A	oh right cos cos he's in like when he's in like Luther and stuff and I've seen him in obviously he's good in films but I am like I was like yes he'd be a good James Bond and then a obviously everyone was like oh he's he's too what they say like he's too street and it's like well he is an actor he can act not street but whatever whatever that's a weird thing to say
B	yeah
A	weird definitely weird
B	Daniel Craig's just like never can't do it
A	I know yeah
B	he's too good
A	yeah I know even though he is like fed up of it now and he's a bit like yeah
B	he just seem to be an arse but I I I understood what he was saying cos you just like like say you you don't have be a marathon
A	yeah it's like the thing is I think he hates the questions you get I think that's the main thing that he hates
B	yeah
A	doing which I would absolutely hate cos pretty much they get like when they do those some of those interviews they're in there for like a day aren't they? and they just go to a different room and they're asked the same questions over and over again how that doesn't drive you mad
B	yeah mm
A	I do not know but erm but yeah and and some of the questions he gets cos he's like I've seen him so many times he must get I think he gets quite a lot of like you know sexist questions quite a lot and he and you can tell he just get you can tell if I were him I'd just get fed up of it like he does he does just get fed up of it and then people like slate him on the internet and I'm like oh look he's getting fed up leave him alone
B	yeah
A	I don't think this is what he signed up for when he wanted to be an actor I know it's kind of what you have to do it's in your contract you have to go out and you have to like you have to go and promote your film don't you? so
B	I saw him on Graham Norton and he seemed to be er happy there
A	yeah I think I think it's fine when you get like when it's Graham Norton when it's like someone who's you know who
B	I think it yeah yeah
A	so but yeah I don't know what you were going to say so I feel
B	yeah but just cos it's like with other people and
A	yeah exactly it's more
B	and he he's not an idiot
A	it's not Graham obviously has questions that he does ask but most of the time they go off on a tangent don't they? and they're chatting about other stuff whereas when they're in those like interview rooms the person has a set amount of interview questions that you have to ask and then they don't really like talk about much else
B	mm
A	so like on the red carpet and stuff when he when he's like walking up and they they have questions that you have to ask so so it's not really their fault either but at the same time I'm like poor guy
B	yeah
A	poor guy
B	mm
A	like cos like when you hear about everyone who like walks out of like interviews and stuff it's like oh my god
B	Tarantino
A	yeah
B	I'm trying to tell you
A	yeah exactly who who did it recently? did Bruce Willis do one recently or something? someone did one with that guy again you know the guy who interviewed er Tarantino?
B	yeah
A	something Murphy or something it's something it's something Murphy I think like his like name
B	I think G begins with a G doesn't it?
A	I don't know but yeah anyway yeah and then someone walked out of his again erm apparently he's like oh
B	he does seem to be an
A	yeah yes he did didn't he? but that that was Richard purposely not wanting to like not wanting to follow
B	yeah you feel like it's him again though so it's like
A	that was good though that I like that cos that's what his whole like Richard's written books that's kind of what his books are about the whole like you know the whole like history of of filming and stuff and
B	mm
A	it's like Jon Stewart Jon Stewart did a film called Rosewater and er he had to obviously go and promote it like he was
A	I came on your show
A	it was funny
B	yeah
A	oh and he was funny on like the English TV as well cos he was like he was like guys I think I was just after David Cameron had became like PM again and er and he was like you know what you have a shorter process than us but you still get the same crappy results guys and Jon Snow was like yeah
A	he's like thank you thank you Jon Stewart for that
A	he was like you guys seem to be getting it wrong as well so
B	oh
A	I do I miss him I miss him
B	oh no read his book
A	yeah I will
B	you'll be fine
A	I will
B	he's done that erm
A	yeah is it
B	summat Earth
A	oh okay no phew was gonna say oh phew I don't know why I'm phewing cos you did get it but I've got one of his of it's there erm what is it? erm books of naked people or something and it's his essays just a collection collection of his essays
B	oh okay no
A	no Earth yeah he's done Earth he's done another one as well the daily but that's not just him that was The Daily Show like the writers on The Daily Show as well
B	okay
A	he's done Earth and he's done another one yeah
B	but like I don't know if if his Earth it seems to be like some of it's good some of it's bad
A	yeah I've seen some I like read like clippings of it and stuff and some of it is quite it's it's very satirical it's all like completely satirical so I guess it's your taste really isn't it?
B	mm I suppose he just like it doesn't flow I guess and it's just like a dicky analysis
A	mm I did wonder how like how he did pardon me how he did a book like that cos
B	mm
B	I hope that's better just cos it
A	yeah
B	it's better innit?
A	yeah
B	er yeah the er autobiographer seemed to well biographer seems to be pretty clued up on
A	oh yeah yeah cos she's obviously done like Steven as well
B	yeah yeah
A	should be good I'll enjoy it
B	should be
A	see books are always the best present to get
B	mm? oh when I get them like I really enjoy them so
A	what did you get
B	er
A	it's not er what's this?
B	er er The Tale of Dueling Neurosurgeons I think it's called
A	oh yeah you've told me about this actually you have you told me about this? when did I last see you? I dunno
B	I think it might might have been by text
A	mm
B	maybe but yeah that's what I'm reading
A	but yeah I think you've mentioned it
B	she tells it in like like the first chapter was about well it's it's all split up into sort of explaining different parts of the brain but through different historical events
A	right
B	like things sort of like duelling opinions like of neuroscientists like there's one in erm like the fourteen hundreds erm
A	you told me has someone has something like though their eye?
B	oh yeah that's the French French king erm
A	how how why have you told me this?
B	Henry the second I think yeah he was jousting and then erm the joust sort of went up into his eye
A	yeah
B	didn't pierce well it it pierced his skull but it didn't hurt his brain but it was the impact that it his brain hit his the back of his skull
A	yeah
B	and sort of like turned to mush erm and then he died slowly from like infection and stuff
A	mm mm
B	erm but it it's like how we now know what we do now because the neuroscientists that looked at him then
A	yeah yeah
B	recorded what was wrong with him and then they saw his brain like oh that must have been like his vision part which lives in the optical lobe
A	yeah
B	that sort of stuff it's pretty cool to sort of
A	yeah
B	mm it's good that it's not just like a all sort of like
A	yeah yeah I like them yeah that's what I liked about like You Know How cos it wasn't
B	no
A	it was his story so it wasn't like so it was kind of told as a story but it was like it wasn't yeah cos I like I like first person narration as well
B	massive hands
B	he does he's got massive hands
A	what at the back there's a picture on the back? I can't remember it
B	yeah yeah oh have you got the book here?
A	I've not seen it no cos you've got it
B	have I? yeah he's got massive hands like I reckon they're like one and a half of his head
A	massive hands you read why he's a surgeon and it wasn't I look down at my massive hands that's why I became surgeon to be fair the way he became a surgeon wouldn't be like wouldn't we wouldn't be able to do it today not in this country
B	no cos he didn't know what to do did he? so it's like ah I'll just
A	he just went and he just dropped out and then went back and well that's maybe if you you really put your mind to it you might be able to
B	mm
A	put the years in but I don't think you'd be able to be a surgeon like I when we went down to
B	yeah I remember those
A	it's not it's not like really bad arguments they're never like it's it's just sort of debates I guess but but their views are really different so when I went down to
B	mm
A	and then when I down there it's like aunt
B	mm and also it it it shows that they blatantly just like just ignored any evidence or chosen not
A	the thing is cos he's not completely but
A	and then and then cos cos she's like another like climate change denier and I was just like great I'm just going to sit here
B	but I'm not sure if it was a good argument because I guess the data that we know from
A	yeah yeah
B	that when it's happened in fifty we don't have that position to know what happened back then
A	yeah yeah exactly yeah and it's stuff like that and then I don't cos I like cos I understood cos he was just like like why the heat? like what
B	yeah they can see a massive difference
A	like completely
B	yeah
A	so I was like okay but never mind
A	mm mm but yeah so er so it was interesting and then er it was all awkward cos they live in America
B	yeah
B	yeah yeah
A	fucking hell
B	fucking hell
A	and I was like I was like not about you though is it?
A	he was like yes but it feels like they don't like us anymore and I'm like it's not about you
A	I know yeah I'm like stop you what are you on about? stop it he says why? it's like this way doesn't work cos you guys always think that it's about you
A	oh yeah
B	and this must be quite a lot of Uber taxi people are erm well they're they're Asian men with beards
A	oh right I thought you were
B	it happens to be the case
A	wanting to talk about something else
B	no er
A	to you? did she say that to you?
B	yeah and I was like see you later
A	yeah like
B	not getting into this
A	no yeah
B	hardcore
A	ah no
B	had to get away from her
A	yeah don't like no don't like that
B	they're getting married did I say it?
A	yeah yeah you told me cos we were
B	aye
A	cos I
B	yeah that was
A	I remember you being like no actually I won't say it then
B	what?
A	you
B	my dad's going now so it's alright
A	no no but I remember that
B	don't want to go like it was just like
A	you should you can invite them I'd like to go to Barbados
B	no you you can go
A	no I'll stay
B	that would be so awkward
B	hi I'm here for
A	I'm here on
B	yeah representative
A	no no
A	I don't think he'd pay for me to go and then give you
B	might
A	doubt it
B	what?
A	no it's cos I remember cos I I must
A	I was like yes
B	I'm pretty sure it it's at least like within a year
A	mm?
B	it's always like usually in a year isn't it?
A	sometimes but I I think mainly but I was like I was like I think you said that to me at the time and I was like sometimes it can be you can be engaged for god knows how long years and years and years
B	what comedy is like they're sort of engaged just like forever?
A	comedy? like what? like a film or a TV show?
B	TV show I think
B	what?
B	yeah yeah ah they're engaged for like I don't know
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	so mm quite sad
B	yeah
A	like that's why I find it weird that they they've got engaged now but it's like when are you going to afford a wedding? like you know the people I said my friends
B	like our age?
A	a year older I know she is I don't know if he is a year older but he seems similar age
B	okay
A	so mm?
B	great
A	I know but then er
B	it's like
A	I I feel awkward when
B	I do feel very awkward
A	cos he's like
B	I know
A	he's like how can you
B	mm
A	I just feel awkward in myself that's why I can never be one of those people who goes up to a couple and is like oh when are you getting married? who can you how can you say that to a couple? oh no
B	yeah cos he
A	how can you say that? cos you don't know you don't know their situation you know nothing and it's like how can you say that?
B	you could spark like someone to go home and like well when is this going to happen? and then
A	exactly spark a
B	a week
A	exactly like I don't understand how people can say stuff like that and they don't I'm like oh god how can you how can people comment? it's like when
B	unless she really she wants a baby as well or?
A	I know yeah no I don't know it's just I just find it awkward I'm like er I don't want to make
B	yeah
A	cos I don't want to make anyone uncomfortable and I'm like
B	I just sit there and grin when
A	yeah you're such yeah you're a creep though you're like yeah
B	exactly I I I know
A	yeah yeah don't make it like serious
B	five years though it already says it five years
A	yeah she like
B	that means like if you're that way you got like nine years to like sort it out
A	to sort it out that's not that's okay though that's not really what I was thinking oh but yeah I don't think that's a short I don't think that's okay
B	no yeah but like it's like daunting innit?
A	daunting
B	all the years I've got to sort out
B	who I'm going to live with the rest of my life and have a kid with them
A	you don't have to you don't have to plan it all but that's what they all they've done anyway
B	they have
A	mm?
B	I'm just thinking about if I was going to plan it but I don't know
A	oh right yeah yeah
A	cos that's what she said she asked me and I'm like I don't have any desire I don't creep me about a little
B	creeps you out?
A	yeah plus plus I'm too selfish nine months that's it's at least obviously nine months is carrying the thing
B	creeps you out? the thing
A	and then then you've got to take time off work afterwards and it's like
B	well it's it's a life sentence
A	yeah and at least at least those at least three years of your life and nine months and you're in
