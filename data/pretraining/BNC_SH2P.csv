A	I probably do burp after I've eaten shit
B	oh
A	I know that's
B	those Korean fucking jeans they're like
A	oh thought they might have been
B	fucking joke dunno sixty-eight kilos or something
A	sixty-eight kilos mate? fuck
B	yes something like that
A	I was like I
B	hundred? you must've been a chunk a proper chunk cos I got a mate who's quite a bit taller than you
A	no
B	and he's a hundred and he's quite big so
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	so you're fucking a hundred
A	I'm a hundred mate
B	with a bit of a belly on you
A	yeah mate I got a fat ass and legs though?
B	yeah
A	no some of it's fat
B	yeah
A	I've got boobies like a fourteen year old girl mate
B	I ain't got much fat
A	the guy at work is so thin yeah he's so fucking thin he's a fussy eater
A	like if you eat badly every day
B	you don't really go lower than about four percent do you as a man?
A	I don't know
B	yeah
A	but and I don't if I told you this if you eat rabbit everyday cos rabbit's so lean it's the leanest meat there's hardly any fat on it
B	if you just eat rabbit
A	if you just ate rabbit
B	yeah
A	you know what I mean not there's not enough fat and then you need
B	yeah
A	you can't rely on that you need fat to live
B	I've never tried rabbit
A	it's nice mate it don't really taste of anything tastes like
B	I bet it's good
A	you know that chicken's like mild doesn't really taste of anything it tastes of the flavours on it of other things?
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	it's like that it's like a white meat it don't taste of nothing
B	I tried crocodile when I out in Cambodia
A	yeah
B	that was interesting
A	yeah? I imagine it's like watery chicken innit?
B	no it's not actually it's like it was like pork
A	does it taste fishy?
B	the closest thing I can describe it to is pork but like a fishy pork
A	yeah that's what I imagine it tastes fishy
B	I had snake as well that was a bit weird
A	mm
B	and I had kangaroo that was good
A	one of my cousins knows how to skin a snake and eat it
B	yeah
A	mm
B	I
B	but I saw some eels getting skinned in Korea and that kind of hit me a bit hard
A	oh mate
B	just go out and do cos that's ridiculous I can't
A	yeah it's not nice seeing things like dying
B	yeah I don't really like it fair enough if you're gonna eat it that's fine but I got a bit of a problem with erm
A	well
B	mounting it up on your wall and that kind of shit
A	or mount it I shoot at work because
B	well you're culling them aren't you?
A	yeah basically it is and I'll eat it if they're good
B	I understand culling animals to a certain degree I'm not entirely sure I understand reintroducing things like wolves
A	well no they won't you know the guy who owns MFI?
B	what's MFI? was that like a music?
A	oh
B	is it an old shop? does it have a red logo?
A	no yeah yeah they sell like sofas and shit like that
B	oh no I don't know what you're talking about
A	and they sell like sofas and beds or whatever
B	yeah
A	and erm he wants to
B	why?
A	cos they're native to the country
B	yeah but I don't
A	you know he wants to re wild Britain back to how it was but
B	but do you think bears are gonna fare too well in England?
A	no
A	what squirrel?
B	do you remember when it was like? hang on a minute
A	mm
B	haven't been on it
A	squeaks a bit
B	oh shit
A	yeah
A	cos I was a bit fucking mashed then er
A	just lingering on the bike mate I'm twenty minutes late from that big group of bikes thinking
B	it was dark was it? what were they all doing out?
A	I don't know mate I was thinking what's this
A	I was thinking why have you got twenty-four seven? maybe they're on some sort of challenge or something
B	doing their cycling proficiency test
A	yeah I thought mate they were like street angels on bikes
B	sorting out
A	I've got a flat tyre don't worry the street angels are going
B	sweep on in and sort you out
A	mm
B	no?
A	no
B	yeah cool
A	yeah it was not that long
B	maybe at the speed you were going
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	how I'm gonna fare
A	I was thinking a bike's is a pretty simple design innit?
B	yeah
A	I wonder when it was invented though
B	er when it was invented?
A	yeah sure they could've made a bike in Ancient Rome?
B	I think the problem was rubber wasn't it? like something that they needed to roll the wheels on cos
A	they could've done it they could've done it with leather
B	they tried to make it out of like wood or something it was like yeah you'd think of leather wouldn't you? that would work
A	yeah my grandad used to run a bike made out of leather cos he was too poor to
B	yeah
B	I'm imagining the whole bike's made out of leather so
B	some weird little floppy bike you know
A	you saw a what?
B	it was a tiny little car and it had no doors it just
A	a car?
B	yeah yeah I'm just saying if ever I've seen a car
A	well
B	I thought that was my car and I would
A	oh right right right
B	it was like a little car with erm no doors it didn't use to have any doors it was like a little what do you call them? is it a hatchback when you can't there's no doors to the back?
A	yeah yeah
B	you just sit in the back so there was only the two front doors they'd been removed and there was just like a piece of rope that was attached like properly well done like and it hooked on to the other side
A	yeah
B	so you just undo the rope and get in your car and do the rope back up
A	where is this in a fucking theme park?
B	I've just it in Greece somewhere just on an island I guess it was just so safe and chilled on the island
A	yeah
B	they just had rope instead of doors and it's probably hot all fucking year round so I mean
A	yeah I know when I first went to Cyprus
B	yeah
A	it was
B	mm
A	but they fucking get well hot in the summer we had to put towels on them they're
B	yeah
A	like
B	did I tell you my friend's got a boat? she's
A	I think so
B	she's got with some guy recently who absolutely loves Depeche Mode but that's just random
A	how old is she?
B	they pretty much spend at the minute she's been out there for a few months and she's
A	how old is she?
B	how old is she?
A	yeah
B	maybe thirty thirty-one
A	oh right like a sugar daddy
B	yeah I mean her last few boyfriends have been kind of old as well
A	yeah
B	not like old old but like forties maybe always like ten ten years older than her maybe erm anyway
A	mm
B	and spend months doing it and I'm hopefully next April or May I've got friends that are teaching in Ankara in Turkey so
A	see I I keep saying to
B	I might teach there
B	if I taught there would you come there?
A	yeah well she's just worried about going there like on holiday mate
B	obviously if I taught there I'd be able to put you up I might have a place for you to crash
A	there's loads of history in Turkey yeah
B	yeah there is
A	Istanbul yeah what's the
B	that's how they said it when I was there so
A	mm they say that in Portugal everything's
B	yeah
A	so you know
B	Portuguese man sounds like Spanish and Russian had a baby
B	it really does I don't
A	ah man I'm trying to think of some of the words I said er
A	and what's thank you?
A	yeah oh no
B	or
A	they used to say oh er oh mate what is it? just anything
A	like
B	Portugese yeah
A	so weird mate
B	or instead of
A	no that's it you can say please in Portuguese and it's
A	I was like
B	I think I think like
B	but I guess it's kinda like the
A	from which?
B	but
A	er I'm trying to think
A	no no that was like please but
B	you've got the same as me mate a high beard
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	do you have to trim this shit?
A	I do sometimes yeah
B	yeah
A	but not always
B	yeah
B	mine goes really high like up here
A	yeah
B	you can see it on the
A	oh mate what is thank you?
B	I mean do you want me to look it up?
A	yeah please look it up it's gonna annoy cos it's not just thank you it's something which you can say like
B	actually I have a laptop now that it's fast enough
B	so I'm like
A	oh mate
B	oh I've just turned it off and you know
A	it's gonna proper annoy me if you find it
B	I'll find it
A	say thank you in Portuguese
A	no no look
B	you like those boobies don't you?
A	yeah it's quite a good
A	cos it's not much colour going on so
B	I looked for one of those yeah
A	yeah it's just like a grey scale apart from on the feet
B	yeah
A	it's a bit surreal
B	well what was I looking for?
A	ah
B	ah
A	they're just like they're gonna say
B	do you know like letters like R and L oh it doesn't work so much for R and L but like S and Z is exactly the same letter? and B and P and G and K are exactly the same letters
A	mm
B	yeah
A	like what the fuck do they
B	but if you put your hand on your throat here
A	yeah
B	and you go ssss
A	yeah
B	and then you go zzzz tell me the difference
A	ssss zzzz there's a humming when I do zzzz
B	yeah it vibrates yeah
A	yeah
B	but that's the only difference in in linguistics it's called voicing and unvoicing so S and
A	mm
B	but one is vibrating the vocal cords and one isn't you have a lot of those
A	mm
B	K is
A	isn't this the difference what of
A	between a vowel and a consonant is?
B	no they're all consonants
A	all they all come from your throat or one comes all from the throat and the other one is produced outside the mouth
B	every sound I just gave you was a consonant vowels are like A E O you know?
A	yeah and they yeah so they'll be pronounced differently
B	yeah
B	well they're
B	well they're all voiced and so consonants can be voiced or unvoiced
A	and
B	but vowels are all voiced
A	yeah
B	you can't make a vowel without vibrating the vocal cords
A	yeah yeah yeah yeah
B	erm
A	everything used to be consonants like the
B	I think you might be talking about the alphabet but not actually pronunciation
A	oh no no no well then in the alphabet no cos
B	because we always require vowels
A	well in the Greek alphabet
B	there's no language which has no vowels
A	well maybe they already had the vowels
B	but like in Hebrew and in
A	but in
B	in Classical Arabic it's written with no vowels like writing is just consonants and then
A	yeah well yeah well Phoenician
B	you can
A	Ancient Greek language originates from the Phoenicians
B	okay
B	that's
A	yeah yeah so the Phoenicians had yeah
B	that's the original
A	and they had mate they had like a hundred odd letters
B	mm
A	and it was all for keeping stocks and all shit like that but then over time
B	yeah
A	before the Ancient Greek one
B	mm mm
A	but there was no
B	well apparently
A	and I think that's why like
A	they started writing loads and doing music and there's like all the music and drama and all that shit
A	of how
B	every single alphabet in the world comes from the Phoenician alphabet every single one in the whole world there's not an alphabet that doesn't come from the Phoenician alphabet
A	erm
B	cos there're other languages if you go to the east
B	they have logographic languages which aren't
A	yeah but what are they called? they they call
B	it's not an alphabet
A	what's what's an insulting name for a Jewish person? someone from Israel?
B	I
A	semitic yeah cos don't you get semitic language?
B	yes that's
A	and I think that where it's split it's split into what we have now what we have now into the Ancient Greek and stuff and the other one went
B	okay
A	and then like later into I don't know fucking
B	yeah
A	is that what semitic is?
B	erm yeah I mean we were talking about alphabets though weren't we?
A	yeah cos you were saying Phoenician language was the first language and everything came from it
B	all
A	well that's
B	in the whole world
A	look up
B	but do you know like what do they have in China?
B	do they have an alphabet?
A	erm I don't really know what it is cos it's
B	it's called logographic it's when
A	just look up
B	I will do in a sec but let me just explain
A	so so we don't forget
B	it's like
A	mm mm
B	to represent phonemes which are the sounds
A	mm mm
B	effectively so we have one letter and that represents a sound we have
A	mm
B	it can be a combination of letters but you make letters to represent
A	mm
B	it's logographic they have a
A	mm
B	they have an image that represents a word and sometimes they can have extra lines that indicate pronunciation
A	mm
B	but in general it's er and that's logographic you then also got hieroglyphic which is more pictorial it's got like images that connect so
A	mm
A	yeah yeah cos erm
B	so what I'm saying is that
A	isn't cuneiform a major part of this?
B	cuneiform was one of the oldest languages in the
A	isn't that like one of the bridges for erm?
B	cuneiform is a type of writing
A	yeah but it's after the Egyptians isn't it?
B	but it's a type of writing it's like the clay slate or something that they wrote on and that
A	but I thought their
B	I think if you Google cuneiform I think it's a type of writing
A	yeah yeah yeah it's just cuneiform came up here somewhere cuneiform
B	yeah yeah
A	no
B	diacritic is any kind of
A	mm
B	if it's aspirated or er er let me take a word for example say P A T what's that word?
B	P A T
A	oh oh pat sorry I thought
B	pat now say splat
A	splat
B	if you notice in the English language the first P that you say is aspirated a puff of air comes out the second one it doesn't hold your hand in front of your
A	pat
B	pat
A	pat
B	can you feel a P? like a puff of air?
A	yeah pat yeah
B	now say splat
A	sometimes you spit
B	say splat
B	there's no puff of air afterwards splat
A	splat splat splat
B	so that would be marked by
A	yeah it could be maybe
B	by it's minimum
A	you went splat
B	it's minimal
A	yeah
B	you'd have to enunciate you have to go splat
A	yeah yeah yeah it's not P you're not like proper pushing the air out
B	that's called aspiration it can either be aspirated or not aspirated so a diacritic would put a little H above it
A	mm
B	and the H indicates that it's got an air puff it's like er
A	yeah
B	I'll show you in a second
A	yeah man
B	do you want me to show you?
A	yeah go for it
B	you might recognise a bunch of these words
A	I tell you what's weird yeah
B	oh
A	you know what I mean? or you're the top you're the best of the best
B	yeah
A	I but I said to my grandad how do you spell
A	yeah there's a few in the Greek ones
B	eh
A	I learnt them all but there's no there's
B	it's not a diphthong
A	when you read when I read
B	but a
A	but they use that as a word but when I asked my grandad
B	but er a diphthong is only a
A	he struggled to spell it
B	I understand that a diphthong is only a vowel
A	mm
B	that would be a monophthong a diphthong would be a double vowel sound like ow ear and then
A	a diphthong is in
B	a a triphthong would be a triple one like
A	mm
B	eh ah
A	yeah
B	ah eh are
A	a diphthong's in erm
B	but what you're talking about is called erm
A	yeah but they didn't have there's no other word like it er I couldn't find one
B	right it doesn't have
A	yeah it's not in the Greek alphabet
B	but we've got
A	so you've got the alpha
B	we've got plenty of sounds in English
A	yeah but you've got C H and when you see it together you know it's like
B	yeah but that's two separate
A	I know but there's yeah but if you if you said
B	but we can draw it that's what you're saying
A	yeah as in church
B	so you can't write in
A	there's no
B	Greek
A	the Greek like
B	they don't have bunch of sounds in all fairness
A	they got alpha yeah it's weird right look under Greek language
B	I was gonna show you this I've seen I know the Greek alphabet
A	yeah just let me show quick
B	ah
A	ah you'll show me this in a minute it's not going anywhere
B	I just need to see who I got this email from could be important
A	well you might be able to explain this to me
A	Greek alphabet
B	Greek alphabet
A	right so there's no
B	yeah
A	alright just click on this one
B	alpha beta gamma delta epsilon
A	okay so there's no
A	where are you?
A	mm
A	it's actually
A	yeah
A	and that's meant to be
B	ah okay that's cool
A	it's it's sort of K K
B	yeah that's a glottal
A	it's an
B	kind of thing
A	yeah
B	it's like a H
A	yeah you know like how
A	yeah it's so that's
B	it's a guttural something or other it's a
A	yeah it's right at the back innit? like when my grandad's trying to get me to pronounce words he's probably like that
B	yeah
A	I'm like
B	no no well that's because that sound
B	we don't have it in the English language
A	yeah that's meant to be like he
B	yep
A	okay? so any E sound is like you pronounce it as in you know for tea like the E for tea is no that's just the one way to pronounce okay? so eater
B	you can change the vowel
A	yeah but why why have that er?
B	why do you change the vowel though? is it for inflection does it change the grammar?
A	I don't know my my
B	or changes
A	grandad was saying like
B	it's just
A	yeah
B	have you even seen IPH?
A	oh what's that all about? why don't they have one
B	no have you ever seen?
A	but why? tell me why that's what I'm asking
B	I don't know
A	are you not curious? why that? why?
B	yeah I mean I have been I might be able to find it better in one of these books actually you might like these books
A	they're big fucking books mate
B	these are encyclopaedias
A	mm
B	right I'm just looking for the IPA chart it's in pretty much every textbook I've ever bought it's just I don't that I don't have my other textbooks
A	I see what you're trying to do here so
A	so instead of saying heel we'd say eel I don't think so like land he's gone land land land
B	what?
A	like here so you've got land land long land
B	yeah
A	as if it's like Essex like land
B	no that's a symbol
A	yeah that
B	that sound is an A sound
A	so why has he done that?
B	the same as in land
A	why why not just done A?
B	that's what I'm trying to show you there's a phonetic alphabet
A	no but I mean you pronounce that one with the A?
B	well it depends whether they're talking I haven't looked at the book are they talking about an old form of English?
A	no it's
B	is this spelling of the old form of English or is this the pronunciation?
A	pronunciation
B	are you sure?
A	erm
B	it may very well not be
A	oh it says dialects
B	so it's erm spelling
A	yeah
B	so these may be the sounds I know that X is that lock sound that you're talking about
A	yeah it's that
B	so that's written as X
A	he he
B	when when you're reading IPA when you get a dictionary and you look at the thing these are all the different vowels that exist in the whole world
A	mm
B	how many vowels do we have in English?
A	I dunno five I think innit?
B	everyone thinks five but we actually have twelve
A	is it five?
B	in the English language and may even be eighteen
A	is it five then?
B	no we have
B	we have five written vowels A E I O U
B	but vowels sounds
A	that's what I mean that was a guess
B	vowel sounds is like twelve or eighteen and you can see how many different vowel sounds there are so when you saw that one here
A	mm
B	that you said was like S X something or other
A	mm yeah yeah
B	that's an ah sound this one that looks like an A is an R sound like bath
A	ah right
B	so it's ah a eh
A	yeah the
A	man men men
B	yeah then you got diphthongs here
B	that one there is or
B	so that you know the
A	yeah
B	they're
A	mm
B	that uh sound is represented by that symbol if you know what I mean? erm you know when you say which or which?
A	mm
B	which you know some people like which house is it?
A	yeah
B	that
A	ah mate complicated now
B	it is complicated but that's what I was talking about so this is diacritics that is do you not think that's amazing though? that somebody's invented one alphabet for all sounds in every single language
A	yeah well
B	you could write any language in this alphabet
A	is there more letters than in English?
B	than in English?
A	yeah
B	we definitely use a few we use a hell of a lot more than Korean they they use probably about half of the amount of sounds than we do
A	yeah
B	erm which means they really struggle to put English words into that er they never say fish they always say pishy
B	no fish pishy
B	what?
A	mm
B	in
A	mm
B	er pam and blam or whatever you know what I mean? but in Korean they're not they can use them interchangeably so instead of saying run they say lun or lice instead of rice because L and R
A	yeah
B	is not distinguished in their language
A	no I know
B	and B and P isn't distinguished so instead of boo sound it can poo sound it's like it's the same thing
A	it's probably why they
B	it's
A	why can't they say it though? just copy the sound?
B	I don't know we play screen golf and I erm
A	yeah yeah
B	and he came out
A	yeah
B	it's terrible
A	yeah
B	my
A	in Arabic they go
B	yeah
A	why is that?
B	it's just the er sound in their language
A	yeah but
B	there's no reason behind it
A	yeah but
B	they just use it to distinguish a word
A	and that their language what spread over a lot of countries so
B	mm
A	so you'd think it will change
B	it does change there's loads of different types of Arabic
A	is there though?
B	there are there's like every single
A	but I read in a
B	it's a little bit different to to Arabic
A	er yeah I suppose so I suppose it's regional isn't it?
B	yeah it's like dialects
A	but there is like a mother
B	but that's the thing
A	a mother language I think
B	I think
A	cos I'm sure people speak different English
B	there's just different dialects
A	in different places
B	would you agree with that? what I've just said?
A	you know what I mean?
B	there are
A	mm yeah I'd say there are languages because I'd say
B	there're some quite interesting maps in here that show like
A	different
B	but a dialect the whole
A	and different sounds
B	what is the definition of a language?
A	and and no need to
B	how do you define if we're speaking the same language? can you give me a definition?
A	cos I can say a word and you would understand it
B	exactly that's perfect yeah it's called mutual intelligibility if you say something that I can understand then we're speaking the same language that is the only definition of language
A	yeah
B	but there can be quite some pretty difficult dialects of a language where you don't really understand what's being said you know what I mean? you you understand most of it but like a lot of colloquialisms or thick Irish accents or thick Scottish accents
A	oh yeah mate the Scottish accent
B	they can be pretty difficult
B	yeah but they're speaking the same language apparently but it's a different dialect now there's a map in here which shows a map of Europe and it's amazing I didn't realise that it quite went to this extent but you know you hear like
A	mm
A	the
B	it's the closest to the English language so if you what you can do on a map
B	it's pretty interesting
A	yeah
B	you can trace a line across Europe
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	and from this point to this point there'll never be a gap where this culture doesn't understand this there's mutual intelligibility moving along the line where the
A	so I can understand a Frenchman so I you're saying if I don't speak another language but I met a Frenchman
B	no you'll follow a line where it's one way reciprocal like we can understand a bit of Frisian if we listen to it it's a bit weird
A	oh right so you're saying
B	but like but we can't understand French so it follows a line
A	a Frenchman might understand me
B	but a Frenchman might understand a bit of Belgian Dutch or something like that
A	yeah well no apparently there's a place in Belgium cos you know you've got Frisia and all that and then there's Alsatia and they're all part of like France Belgium or whatever
B	mm
A	but they're actually like regional places
B	yeah
A	quite important places
B	yeah that's what I'm talking about
A	they speak a different language in northern
B	so effectively there aren't really any different languages
A	ah I think it depends how you grow up do you know what I mean?
B	but effectively it's just dialects there's a famous quote
A	oh yeah but if you grow up in a place where all these dialects were going on it would just seem like one language
B	yeah
A	but you just got a lot of fucking different ways of pronouncing the same word
B	yeah
A	do you know what I think?
B	what?
A	that we do not know who we are or where we're going in
C	have you decided about that amp?
B	what about it? the big one?
C	yeah
B	no no it's yours mate
C	yeah?
B	yeah are you selling it?
C	yeah
B	yeah okay
A	what amp is it?
B	when? do you want to get it down now?
A	it's not the
C	I'm doing Ebay and they've got
A	it's not the Marshall is it?
C	yeah it is
A	ah you're selling that? that's such a good quality amp
B	I know it is a nice amp
A	why are you selling the
B	cos it's his
A	oh right
B	I gave it to him
B	mate it's Hindi and Urdu it's identical the language is the same it's just different countries erm
A	yeah
B	now when you're move in with someone they're probably gonna be like oh my god the neighbours and
A	yeah mind
A	a
B	yeah
A	I think yeah it's had it mate
C	not today
B	oh you changed it
C	yeah
B	oh shit
