A	erm
B	right
A	and I had to do a load of
B	right
A	and er yeah I had to produce screenshots which meant I had to kind of
A	had to make them and
A	so it was all a bit kinda frantic and I got it down to nine nine five words in the end
B	nice one
A	which erm you know
B	well when will you hear back?
A	erm
B	right
A	so you have an opportunity to respond to peer review comments
B	right I see yeah but there's also panel
A	yeah
B	okay
A	and and it's probably the panel
B	right
A	in years previous
B	mm mm?
A	erm and he said that
B	right
A	I think it's an opportunity to pick up on things they
B	that they they might have missed expertisewise yeah
A	they don't might not have the expertise or
B	like I said they could hopefully spot someone that's being bitter
A	yeah so so if they liked it then then that might you know
B	yeah
A	might be okay er but you know I don't know
B	well we'll see
A	I will I'll be happy with the job we did for the responses I couldn't do any more than that
A	it is yeah and if they want if they like it and fund it then great if they don't then we'll we'll just try harder
B	yeah
B	oh dear
A	it was
A	I erm yeah I went out and
A	the bits of his roof had fallen off

A	usually they get back in contact quickly but yeah he's sorta battling on you know
B	yeah
A	doing his thing
B	yeah I know he's amazing
A	impressive yeah he is
B	yeah he is lovely lovely guy
A	and I I you know I of course offered that if if they ever need

B	yeah
A	she's got cataracts so
B	has she? oh no
A	she can't really see
B	oh no
A	poor thing
B	so you should go yeah you should go round there a bit more
A	so yeah
B	I know that you know
A	he's he's a very sort of
B	oh yeah absolutely but it's always nice to have a bit of company
A	yeah yeah I know
B	erm
A	yeah
A	how's your work?
B	ah erm yeah meh you know just er
A	any news on the?
B	no not yet not yet erm
A	okay yeah
B	seen the emails and things so
A	okay so
B	it's out of you know it's out of my hands there's nothing more for them
A	the ball's in someone's court
B	yeah there's nothing more that me or
A	but you guys aren't ready
B	I know but this time erm they're already they've set some test dates for September and it
A	you've done it before that's got to put you yeah
B	yeah we've done it many times before but I mean literally you know
A	give you an advantage
B	somebody could undercut us by many tens of thousand you know it's
A	how much do you do you know how much?
B	I can't remember cos they haven't paid us for last year but you know it's it's a it's a good deal
B	neh dunno
A	yeah I'm saying it's a good deal when you get the money
B	yeah when you get the money yeah I think it's about a quarter of a million I dunno
A	sounds like quite it sounds like quite a lot for
B	yeah yeah well anyway erm
A	I mean that's the sort of grants we should be applying for
B	we're just on the same carousel you know
A	oh yeah yeah
B	you thought you'd finally put it to bed like you know stuff about disabilities and
A	yeah
B	you know
A	it's almost like you wanna point to the frequent you need a frequently asked questions
B	yeah
A	it's such a yeah
B	mm
A	look through these frequently asked questions
A	you know there's just it
B	I could deal with a lot of my
A	something along those lines
B	yeah
A	so not actually the craziest of ideas
B	no
A	came up with a good idea me and my hairdresser well you know
A	came up with a good idea which was pay as you go haircuts
B	yeah
A	so it we thought you could like cos he
A	I said and he goes well no actually it'll be ten P they're two-ply and I said well they're man-size it's gotta be twenty P
A	and then we carried on this er this throughout and saying you know you could you could like have
A	it could be a pound
B	yeah I suppose yeah
A	you could have you know the clippers
B	yeah yeah
A	that could be another pound as opposed to scissors
A	you know
B	I think
A	bike parking
B	it it's easier isn't it?
A	yeah but it's quicker
B	yeah but you know
A	anyway
B	clippers is quicker
A	bag storage coat storage bike parking
A	yeah but we're running out of ideas
B	yeah aren't you?
A	I think I might've insulted him slightly as well
B	oh no
A	well I don't know
B	no that's not rude no it's fine
A	but then it got me thinking
B	yeah exactly cos you can't see
A	because if if people couldn't see you
B	yeah
A	you just wouldn't care
B	no
A	and if you couldn't see your own hair why would you care?
B	yeah no exactly
A	it wouldn't affect how you felt about yourself cos you wouldn't that's it so
B	yeah
A	well yeah
A	so if you don't care about anyone else
B	yeah
A	you're probably someone with really unkempt hair
A	that's it
B	yeah
A	but you know
B	I frequently get to work look in the mirror and think oh probably should've brushed my hair this week
A	like if I see
B	and sometimes I do it
A	yeah
A	yeah that's true
B	everyone else
A	maybe that's why
B	everyone else'd be repulsed but I mean
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	then you do something about it but I don't go to the bathroom to look at my hair
B	no
A	not usually
A	unless I've just had a haircut and I feel like I've got like haircut
B	yeah it looks nice this time no it's it's it's good
A	yeah it's got nothing it's got nothing in it so it's au naturel
B	yeah cos the sides
A	yeah
B	maybe you should've got your sides shorter
A	well I
B	yeah
A	by razor
B	no not those not your beards
A	oh I see
B	yeah I was I think you should maybe go four
A	maybe a bit shorter
B	well I mean why don't why don't you do it?
A	four's a bit short
B	all I'm saying is why don't you do it before you go on holiday? cos you're clearly worried about how you're gonna
A	the other
B	you had it done at a four
A	yeah
B	then you know two weeks you'd be a six so
A	there you go that's question for Google isn't it?
B	yeah
A	how long does it take to go from a four to a six?
A	yeah
A	you know I mean this is an obvious one but
B	mm
A	conflict of interests when it comes to doing what you ask them to
A	cos if you ask for something really short
B	yeah
A	but you're likely to come back with the same length of hair
A	then erm
B	yeah maybe
A	it's their in their interest to
B	mm yes
A	so that you come back sooner
B	some people do
A	but I suspect a lot of men do it basically on the point which they realise that they have to go and get their hair cut
B	I don't know I think a lot of I think a lot of blokes do do it once a month or whatever you know
A	and then that got me thinking
A	so maybe they you can't can't tell
A	no but they should care
A	because if it is based on looks then they're better off not going as short as people ask
B	mm
A	and paid a lot of money for a very stupid looking haircut
B	yeah
A	which annoyed me they'd barely cut my hair
B	yeah
A	they I thought you just get a you know I made the mistake of going to a hairdresser's salon when I should've gone to a barbers
A	is that
B	yeah
A	sounds alright
B	sounds alright
A	basically I don't think hairdressers are looking into their clientele enough
B	maybe
A	they could you know I have it figured if they
A	they could you know why shouldn't that increase revenue by twenty percent? or or close to that if a lot of people
B	I'm thinking to myself that this is a two espresso recording
A	what?
B	as in that's how many you'd need to keep yourself awake while typing this up
A	some people might appreciate my er musings on
B	er hair
A	improving and optimising other business models
B	well that's it yeah
A	no we've got nothing to say about that
B	no?
A	no
A	yeah and okay here's another here's a business idea
B	oh
A	so loads of young people
A	I'm gonna sound old but okay people who are
A	still at
B	mm
A	in the winter they've so often
B	mm
A	not got gloves on
B	yeah
A	and no they do
B	yeah
A	cos they've got freezing hands they just
B	yeah
A	aren't
B	okay so what's the business idea you're gonna be a
A	ahead
B	at traffic lights
A	it is
B	that's a really good idea
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	cos they're literally I remember stood by this guy and this guy was like like rubbing his hands and I said your
B	yeah
A	to have warm hands for the day
B	yeah you're right
A	not that I wanna like extort
B	no
A	take advantage of younger people but
B	no
A	you know
B	just young people so what I you know you know when it was really really cold last week?
A	you can don't have to
B	somebody that I worked with cycled in in shorts
A	really?
B	they're the most weird colour I've ever seen on a live person
A	cos some
B	he
A	pretty much
B	he I think it was minus something and he looked awful
B	I've never seen such a horrific colour on
A	really?
B	yeah
A	he obviously wasn't cycling fast enough
B	if he'd've been laid down I'd've said he was dead
A	was like a proper? was he like on a road bike or?
B	no no he was you know
A	pootling along
B	no no no no I mean he yeah I work with the guy I dunno he looks to be about fifty
A	does he have a cup that says
B	no I I don't know I don't think he's
A	mm
B	does he cycle?
A	yeah
B	in shorts and sandals even in the winter?
A	I think so yeah I don't know I
B	I know he did
A	you know he did?
B	yeah you told me that before
A	oh did I? oh okay
B	yeah
A	no
B	how do you know?
A	cos
B	just a
A	that's the sort of thing that goes round
A	oh the guys you find out about new appointees
B	he must be good he must know IT
A	yeah no no actually it's probably it's the probably the a safe thing to do actually
B	yeah
A	who clearly aren't techies
B	yeah true
A	erm
A	mm
A	you do my computer scientist
A	erm and er yeah but it's turned out we've lost a lot of data
B	oh
A	which is a real pain
B	mm
A	only post-crash data which is a real pain I mean we've got all the other data apparently
B	were there some people that joined after the crash or something?
A	yeah yeah yeah there
B	yeah just
A	which is safe but
B	yeah
A	I
B	I'd say
A	well the the disk on the
B	well I dunno
A	mm I don't think it was sabotage
A	you sound a bit chesty
B	mm
A	oh yeah you'll get my cold then
B	yeah probably
A	then you'll know although you've got the right chromosomes for not
B	not making a fuss?
A	not having a
B	I will just strap a tissue to my nose and get on with it
A	you know if your er if your XY you get you get the full-blown you only get half of it cos you well I don't understand the I don't
A	of course but er yeah
A	you XX people are lucky
A	pretty bad though
A	I
B	yeah
A	the guy's been fighting cancer for like ten years
A	sure enough he's a post-op recovery
A	may've taken a bit more out of him
B	oh
A	but he's still in the garden
B	oh
A	but you know don't they don't make em
B	that's a real man that's a man's man
A	yeah
B	no they certainly don't not in this house
A	maybe his generation didn't suffer so much with their man colds
B	maybe
A	this week's going quickly
B	it is going quickly
A	yeah
B	having said that does feel like a little while since Christmas
A	has it? oh yeah yeah I guess so
B	a lot's happened
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	instead you've gotta
B	yeah
A	you know this
A	yeah I'm really
B	yeah no I know
B	well you know go to your folks
A	when are the London?
