D	later I think that night we'd gone out with
A	right
D	done in Morecambe Bay because Morecambe Bay's huge
C	yeah
D	and if you'd just gone round one more village around you would've been in a completely different kind of atmosphere
A	yeah
C	how strange is that that it's
B	a glorious kind of
A	well you go you go from Exmouth to Sidmouth just in
C	it's a line
A	but they are all different
C	yeah
A	compared to Lyme Regis
B	yeah
C	Charmouth
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	very different
D	yeah
A	they've all got their own little
D	yeah
C	really different
D	our friends actually
A	right
D	and they were quite clever what they did was that rather than going round Australia for six months
D	they bought a erm a a you know like a
A	yeah
C	oh yes that's the like the?
A	oh yes
D	that's the similar to that
A	yeah

A	you do need the weather and it's
D	yeah
A	come to sunny Devon where it rains six days out of seven
D	yeah
A	usually well we've had a good summer this year but

D	but it's funny isn't it
C	yes
D	like how it's almost like
A	yeah
D	in England
A	yeah
D	you know that actually that is the part of the world that reminded them of Sydney

D	up
C	yeah
D	but then she went
C	what what if?
D	Nicole Kidman's daughter
C	yeah
D	but it's a different it's a different mentality isn't it?
A	mm
C	yeah
D	it's like in New Zealand
C	yeah
D	when you see the All Blacks going through whatever regional airport
A	mm
B	nobody even touches them
C	no
A	no
B	just leave them to kind of be who they are and
D	nobody
A	yeah
D	yeah
B	you know
C	I like that though I like that
D	I was I was like I was like literally there was

A	yeah
B	and in

D	they're not erm
D	reminds me oh my daughter goes to a school with
D	yeah
C	yeah
D	yeah no one
D	no
D	yeah
C	oh Russell Crowe yeah
D	now I don't know whether he's actually got kids but he's with somebody who
C	yeah I yes
D	and they were all having a play in the playground this playground's quite big
C	yeah
C	actor yeah
D	he had a bit of a crowd
C	mind it no
D	and people asked him for autographs
C	yeah
D	but he didn't
C	well that's who's made them famous so
D	yeah
C	I don't think they should mind really cos the public have made them famous haven't they?
D	no they shouldn't
C	yes they do yeah
D	cos they've
C	mm
D	got a really heightened sense of importance of self importance
C	yes I think they do get a bit above themselves don't they?
D	yeah
A	oh yeah yeah
D	and they're not they're not amazing for anything in particular
A	no
D	apart from being in the papers
A	the papers
C	mm
A	yeah
A	famous for being famous
D	or some dodgy TV show that
A	yeah
D	shows that they have no talent really
A	yeah
D	whatsoever
A	yeah
D	it's bizarre isn't it?
A	what like
C	mm
A	erm Only Way
D	Only
C	yeah The Only Way
D	you see I I
C	Chelsea
A	Made In Chelsea
C	Made In Chelsea
D	oh is that right I what's the Made In Chelsea one about?
C	oh that's it's fascinating I love it I love all I love the Essex one and l love Chelsea but it's all
A	it's all
C	oh yeah I don't know where they well
D	what's the format of it?
C	well it's erm
unknown_female	mm
C	it's a group of twenty year old plus
D	right
C	and they just go shooting and they have parties I think they
D	why shooting?
C	yeah but they they're not they're very posh and they go clay pigeon shooting
D	oh they go oh
C	they go polo they go to polo
D	right
C	but they don't seem to work I don't know what they do very bizarre things
D	oh that's strange isn't it?
C	yes yeah and it's all about their lives and they're always falling out drinking
B	mm
A	educated
B	there's one that I
A	yeah
B	seven to ten year olds
A	yeah
B	or something like that
A	yeah
B	trying to place their kids into Harrow
A	yeah yeah
A	yeah
B	and that was really really interesting
A	yeah
B	yeah
D	do you think it's real?
C	it is some of it is real but some of it is set up for your own
D	right
C	they are real people
D	yeah
C	they do
D	yeah
C	live their lives unbelievably like that
D	wow
C	they're quite
D	cos you you do wonder if you they find these actors
A	mm
B	they're not
C	no they weren't they're a group of friends
D	they're they are real people
C	yeah and erm in the summer they were over in erm New York
D	you see I'm asking a question there
C	shopping in Prada
D	and I think to myself would they have gone to New York had they not been in a TV programme?
C	well
D	or the TV programme pays for them to go to New York
C	oh I don't know that
D	as in to get like a bit more of entertainment out of it
C	possibly possibly
B	mm
C	but it sounded like they go over there as a thing to do
D	yeah
C	and you
D	I think it's right like you know I
C	yeah
C	yeah
D	all sorts of things
C	yeah yeah
D	but they have been heavily screened
C	yeah
D	to be a particular type
C	type yes
C	cos they're all attractive
D	and
C	yeah
D	if somebody says oh you might suggest
C	yeah
D	going to New York
C	yeah
D	and doing this with these people
C	yeah
D	you go if you're twenty
C	yes yeah
D	I would
C	yeah
D	and especially so if you give me some pocket money
C	yes yeah
C	but they've all been school
D	yeah
C	they've all been to
C	their own boarding schools and things
D	yes
C	cos they talk about meeting but Chelsea
C	but I don't know what they do day to day
D	right
C	one of them's in dabbles in a bit of photography
D	right
C	erm like The Only Way Is Essex they have opened shops in Brentwood
D	right
C	so they've all got beauty salons dress shops
D	so there's some sort of something
C	yeah
D	just their lives as in they set up a business and
C	but
D	ah
C	I
D	ah
C	cos Brentwood you have holiday companies bringing all the young people who watch it and they stay in the motel
D	right
C	erm and yeah it's makes big business
D	around yeah
C	and Brentwood is a tourist spot now
D	wow
C	which is very amusing
D	yeah
C	so
D	and and what and how
C	yeah
D	you know this TV programme
C	yeah
D	in a way
C	and a lot of them leave the show
D	yeah
C	they they go into that
D	transforms life
C	er yeah
D	and I guess
C	yeah
D	that's the appeal isn't it? that's why people do want to do it
C	I would say he's the only one who's really made it
D	but you see he might've made it without that TV show
C	yeah cos he's got the good looks
D	okay
C	he's got the
D	he would've made it probably
C	nice personality
D	it's just propelled him a bit fast first
C	yeah
D	and none of the others are quite?
C	no they don't really make it
D	really
C	they haven't got quite that edge
D	no
C	to what he had
D	ah they're still in the show
C	well they go
D	get their
C	and everything and then they come back because obviously they can't find themselves so
D	oh I see
C	so they come back to the show
D	right
C	character yeah
D	that just happens to come back in
C	yeah
D	but where's the steady flow of of people
C	well because
D	being fed into it or?
C	yes I think so yeah cos they all meet in the nightclubs they're all kind of
D	oh
C	a room of friends that
D	I see
C	well
D	it makes me think of that
C	oh yes yeah that's
D	Jim
C	that's it
D	and that film was shown years ago
C	that's yeah that's right
D	but it really makes me think that if you are on these shows in these shows
C	well they say for The Only Way Is Essex most of it is true but they set up scenarios that are for your entertainment
D	well yeah
C	so they're either the girls are usually at the beauty salon having their hair or nails done
C	there's er a chap who's gay
D	oh no yeah
C	life and
D	well it is in a way
C	awful really
D	it's well but part of it's compelling because if you think about it it's based on theatre
C	yeah
D	as in all these different characters
C	yes
D	put them all together see what happens
C	yeah
D	then we watch films which we see that happening
C	yeah mm
D	Eastenders whatnot
C	yeah
D	so really this is just moving from that back to reality
C	yeah
D	cos apparently these people are real
C	yes yeah
D	and they are real
C	yeah
D	but they've been erm
C	yes
D	in the sense that
C	yeah
D	there's the fat one
C	yeah
D	there's the this one who doesn't know he's a
C	yeah
D	that's a little artificial
C	yeah
D	for me cos I would say
C	they're all attractive and handsome
D	right
D	attractive handsome
unknown_female	and fake
D	oh for god's sake
C	yeah it isn't until you start digging in it that you think er
D	yeah
C	The Only Way Is Way Is Essex but but you cannot not watch it it's a bit of relaxation and I just find it funny
D	you've got an interest
C	yeah and I know that pub
D	yes yeah yeah
C	oh look at that bit I like
C	but they're awful people their people
D	yeah absolutely
C	their language their and they're horrible
D	they swear a lot?
C	yeah and they cause trouble some have been in prison drugs
D	right
C	one is in drugs he's suddenly out of the show
D	oh dear
C	he's been caught with cocaine
B	yeah so erm
A	yeah yeah
B	erm
A	yeah
B	orchestra
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	that kind of thing
A	yeah
B	like four hours a day of their particular exercises
A	yeah
B	and and I think four out of five of them were heavily pushed by their parents
A	yeah
B	it's er very very very interesting
A	yeah how many of them got in?
B	I think just two
A	yeah
B	having been through the experience
A	yeah
B	and the other two were going to try again
A	right
B	yeah I think he was really experienced and good at all
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah cos er they're only erm
A	yeah
B	and if they never you know if they never reach this level
A	yeah
B	then then their whole world comes down crashing down around them
A	yeah
B	then they've gotta kind of rebuild from
A	yeah
B	then you can go up another level
A	yeah
B	but it depends on who
A	if you've already got that background it allows you to move up another level
B	yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	yeah
B	and then in society failure is treated as failure
A	yeah
B	you're at the bottom of the heap you've failed
A	yeah
B	and that's what it is it's an experiment you find you need to change something
B	well there's
A	yeah
B	if you go through school and you've got
A	no
B	but in fact you are the same as everybody else you're just
A	maybe
B	erm I'm very kind of interested in these like kind of alternative ways of education and
A	yeah
B	yeah yeah yeah try to challenge having to work within a curriculum
A	yeah yeah OFSTED
B	yeah it's ridiculous
A	it is ridiculous
B	that's it I mean it's it's no different than erm
A	yeah
B	that it no longer
B	yeah
B	yeah sorry?
A	it's where the children in the country live
B	okay
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	Montessori education
A	yeah
B	yeah yeah yeah
B	but that costs them a lot of money
A	yeah
B	and they I mean they're they're set up as
A	yeah
B	or a franchise or whatever it is
A	you've got Mark Wright who's in Strictly Come Dancing
D	yes
A	he's ex yeah
C	he's made it
D	he's actually done really well hasn't he?
C	he's out of it he never came back did he I think he came back for a Christmas show but he never
A	yeah yeah
D	he's done alright out of it
A	yeah
D	probably
A	possibly
A	yeah
D	faster
A	there's one or two you wouldn't want as
D	yeah
A	next door neighbours
D	but you know getting back to locations and stuff that's what I feel like when I watch Grantchester
A	yeah
D	Grantchester? you know there's a Grantchester
A	yes yeah yeah yeah you did yeah
D	it's erm where erm
A	we went past Geoffrey Archer's house
