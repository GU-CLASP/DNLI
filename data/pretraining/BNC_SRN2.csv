B	sorry?
B	hence the er hence the similar name
A	oh right
B	probably may as well get the most up-to-date one

B	I think it's got more battery life
A	as in it's more efficient
B	yeah
A	alright porker?
A	yeah sure
B	yep
A	right small pieces of meat

A	in technical language fuck all
B	oh
A	did you have no did you have the options when you turned it on?

A	yeah I'm just gonna I've just shut it down and I'm restarting it
B	okay
A	there
B	did it look more normal then?
A	yeah yeah it defaulted to it when you turned it on without actually doing anything
B	I don't normally do anything
A	well yeah but it doesn't normally come up with the DOS screen saying
B	do you want something?

A	you haven't got
B	where?
A	you haven't backed it up?
B	well it's kind of sporadically backed up but they're kind of you know I
A	can I suggest you take a back up of your entire hard drive
B	have you got a external hard drive I can put it on?
A	no not that's big enough for yours and mine
B	I well I've got it
A	well if I can suggest that you should keep your music backed up
A	mm
B	erm
A	as I actually just told you to
B	I could just buy a cheap external hard drive
A	er well there's not a lot of point
B	well er as I was saying well if I'm gonna back it up I need something to back it up onto
A	mm true
A	well cos I've got a neat one which is enough to take mine and sits neatly in the fire safe
B	I know but it doesn't take mine
A	well you know if you're gonna be sort of rational about it I just can't argue with you
B	ha ha it's gutting isn't it?
