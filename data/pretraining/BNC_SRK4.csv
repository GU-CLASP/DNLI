A	if I get a training position they start at forty grand I mean what training positions starts at grand? yeah
B	training?
A	like a trainee
A	bullshit today cos I looked into doing accountancy cos I used to be really good at numbers
B	well I think it's the contacts he's got
A	no I
B	well he said his sister's walked into a job straight after uni and
A	really?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	there's no fucking way I'd be able to
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	he's got such hope
B	different places than I have
A	it's what he wants isn't it?
B	yeah it's what he wants he's comparing himself against them
A	mm
B	and so he feels like
A	it's like
B	he's not achieving
A	oh I see that's why
B	because all of his mates are multimillionaires
A	yeah
B	yeah I think so well cos he went like through like private schooling and
A	yeah
B	you know a very to do education
A	yeah
B	kind of
A	yeah
B	and you do kind of measure yourself against your peers a bit don't you?
A	yeah you do yeah see
B	I mean
A	against my peers I feel like I've done quite well
B	yeah I mean everyone does I mean you have a quick look on Facebook don't you?
A	yeah yeah
B	I mean I think everyone must do it
A	what people
B	I mean like
A	are doing
B	click through that like er
A	but I don't know what
B	people you went to school with
A	yeah
B	everyone must do that
A	yeah
B	cos you can't think globally in terms of success cos it it's not
A	what?
B	and went to the Champions League final
A	oh my god
B	I mean that's the kind of life
A	no
B	but that's you know he was rubbing shoulders with those kinds of people
A	yeah
B	and
A	yeah well he must be though because I don't think this job is shit and I feel like I've worked
B	yeah
A	mm I mean there is parts of it that's a bit er
B	no I'm really happy with this job
A	yeah I'm happy with what I teach them too I feel like I'm er I am teaching them the structure of essays and I am teaching
B	yeah
A	I feel like I'm helping them
B	yeah
A	but some people think that it's just
B	just a shitty dossy job
A	that it's shit and we're not teaching them anything
B	yeah
A	that really really
B	I think it's what you make of it isn't it? but
A	huh?
B	it's what you put into it
A	yeah but then
B	yeah
A	because the marking schemes everybody gets like
B	well yeah no cos that's all education is it's just a money making scheme
A	no but I I feel like I
B	yeah yeah I do
A	by teaching them different things that if if a teacher didn't bother with
B	yeah
A	then
B	yeah I feel like that
A	I don't understand
B	as well
A	why my students don't do better than those
B	I feel like that as well but then on the other side of that you've got things like what we were doing the other week with er presentations showing them bad examples you know where you've got I don't know grey writing on dark grey writing on a black background
A	and the students do exactly
B	and everyone in class when you were showing that they were laughing going oh ha ha you know
A	yeah that's it
B	that's funny and then lo and behold when they give their presentations
A	yeah
B	that's just pure laziness on their I mean they
A	yeah bit sad isn't it?
B	so I mean how much
A	yeah
B	are they just sat there going through the motions but not actually paying attention? I dunno
A	they say to me that they are but then
B	yeah some of them
A	but the marking it's it's like the
B	yeah
A	it is a joke because even I'm gonna do it now sit there and work out exactly what people have got for their
B	yeah
A	if I was at uni I'd be gutted if I got fifty-five but most of these kids are gonna get fifty-five
B	yeah
A	decide
B	well it doesn't in the sense that it's a foundation so it's not going towards any overall mark is it? it's just getting them on to the next year
A	well
B	any marks than that it's the top ten percent
A	yeah
B	who'll get the scholarships
A	yeah but even the top
B	yeah
A	and just
B	well
A	too tired
B	there are such problems cos I mean I never give over seventy well I very rarely
A	mm
B	I think about seventy-five is the highest I've given and
A	me too
B	you see some people and
A	very rarely
B	they're doing like eighty-five
A	yeah
B	that's a massive difference
A	yeah
B	and what's the difference between a seventy-five and an eighty-five? it gets really complicated
A	mm
B	that's not that's not clear at all
A	twenty-five and thirty-five?
B	well they don't if they get thirty-five they get put through anyway
A	mm
B	so in effect if you've got people getting twenty-fives
A	are you recording?
B	yeah
B	well I just switched it on a bit earlier
A	I want to talk about something now
B	oh what?
