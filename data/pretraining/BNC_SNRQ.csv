A	monster Jobs? I did in Spain
B	that's what I'm thinking I don't have time with him
A	yeah
B	mm
A	oh really?
B	but it's really low pay
A	oh wow
B	it's really hard to do to get in to do it
A	really?
B	yeah
A	mm
B	shortlisted so
A	so what you'd start off as an assistant speech therapist?
B	mm hm
A	ah
B	and whilst you're doing that do a course
A	yeah
B	and then you can become a speech therapist or there's a one year course but it's in Essex or London
A	eh huh
B	you'll have it with your relevant degree and then you can do a one year sort of like fast track to be a speech therapist
A	fantastic
B	I was interested in it but I'm not sure it's just
A	yeah
B	now I've got little
A	and what do they class as a relevant degree?
B	well something with
A	what did you study?
B	linguistics and Spanish
A	oh really?
B	yeah
A	ah
B	yeah
A	so yeah tell me about speech therapy
B	I think so
A	mm
B	because you have to learn about everything but and I think you have to specialise
A	mm
B	so but then to do the speech therapy em
A	oh
B	before so
A	oh don't you? Have you not taught kids?
B	I taught for two weeks one Easter
A	and doesn't having your own kid?
B	well now I have
B	now I have and I'll see how his language develops
A	yeah I heard that
B	mm hm
A	but they do take a little longer
B	yeah
A	mm
B	let alone two
A	mm
B	in Canada
A	I miss speaking Spanglish
B	mm hm
A	different languages have better ways of
B	my thing was I put English grammar
A	so when did you learn Spanish?
B	just doing the degree I think that was my mistake
A	uh-huh
B	and then you were supposed to finish your degree the same level as someone who's done GCSE plus A level
A	blimey
B	so
A	that's eh that's a lot
B	and it was then we were  we were  put together then after the first year with people who had done GCSE A-level plus the first year
A	crikey
B	and then
A	and did you spend time in Spain as part of your degree?
B	yeah
A	oh lovely
B	for nine months and I thought I understood some Spanish but when I went to Granada I didn't understand anyone
A	mm
B	except my landlord and he was an English teacher
A	mm hm
A	it is so much more difficult on the phone as well isn't it cos?
B	yeah we did have when I was when em and luckily I was with eh
A	mm
B	there were certain areas that we phoned and they would say no sorry
A	yeah
B	we want Spanish speakers
A	I guess they didn't want people who would be only there for like nine months or something
B	yeah
A	mm
B	and
A	have you been back to Granada's since you lived there?
B	no I haven't
A	uh-huh
B	and it was like a the traditional part
A	whereabouts is that? I know Granada a little bit em yeah
B	it's up by it's not far from The
A	uh-huh
B	so it is really close and like that's on top of the hill and it's down the side
A	ah lovely where all the little white houses are
B	yeah
A	with the patios and aw
B	yeah
A	that is
B	but we did
A	oh
B	and it's quite dark
A	I like them though
B	but it's lovely
A	nice
B	very traditional Spanish
A	mm
B	I did yeah
A	mm
B	I can watch Spanish films
A	yeah
B	mm
A	hearing them don't you?
B	yeah
A	but you you don't your brain doesn't actually automatically throw them out until you've actually used them
B	welI I read Spanish and I say em like I understand that story so I don't understand then why I don't know it when I try and speak
A	I think there's some theory that says you have to use a word seven plus or minus two times before your brain can produce it
B	mm hm
A	so you can  you can  recognise it but you have to actually
B	mm
A	uh-huh
B	he said oh you sound like you're from Granada
A	is he from the north?
B	I think so
A	yeah
B	no
A	ah
B	he's from Madrid
A	well in Granada do they speak with like if they say gracias do they say gracias or
B	mm
A	eh
B	gracia
A	yeah
B	yeah they don't have the Ss on the end
A	but did you practice it a lot or did you like em have a lot of Spanish friends and speak with them or was it a more Erasmus students sticking together?
B	more Erasmus students
A	yes
B	you know translation em part and a lot of the students wanted to practice their English with you
A	uh-huh
B	but they said this university was like the equivalent of Oxford and they were you could tell it was  it was  very good
A	mm hm
B	university and their English was very good
A	mm
B	with no accents some of the younger students
A	well they learn it from such a young age over there don't they?
B	and and you can imagine they like the equivalent of the like rich students
A	mm
B	I lived with
A	uh-huh
B	yeah but we we tried sometimes to speak in Spanish
A	it's really unnatural though isn't it? It's difficult
B	yeah
A	and I
B	it is
B	things like that or having having to eh I went to the dentist and had to explain in in Spanish what what was wrong and
A	mm
B	I was a beginner when I went
A	mm
B	mm
A	is you're interacting in society were your  were your  classes in Spanish?
B	they were
B	I ended  I ended  up giving a presentation in Italian oh
A	oh no
B	and I sort of three six nine nine hours a week I did Italian
A	mm
B	and it was either Italian French or German I had  I had  to take that fitted in into my timetable
A	uh-huh
B	and I did a translation from Spanish to English science and technology
A	mm
B	but I couldn't do it the other way because my Spanish wasn't good enough
A	uh-huh
B	so I was just taking it the higher level
A	mm hm
B	modules of
A	mm hm
B	and then Spanish to English
A	yeah I did a
B	mm hm
A	you're not necessarily translating
B	yeah
A	so I found it quite difficult to to I don't know sometimes English would just sound
B	yeah I had to  yeah I had to change it I did one module of theory and of translation and that was quite interesting
A	mm
B	but can you imagine like sitting in lectures and I was please don't ask me a question
B	for the first semester I didn't understand
A	mm
B	there was an older guy we did em Spanish History and em he was just like la la la la la la
A	monotone
B	yeah he just and he had like his notes in front of him and turn the page la la la la la
A	head down don't pick me
B	please don't pick me
A	what were your classes lectures?
B	pardon?
A	were all your classes lectures format?
B	no
A	uh-huh
B	but the translation from Spanish to English the science one it was taught by an English guy
A	uh-huh
B	who did the lesson in English
A	ah
B	and eh so that was  that was  I mean cos then he would always use me as the the person to explain things
B	to the some of the students
A	did they set up any language exchanges for you?
B	yeah they did and I had an
A	oh good
B	I had em I did with one girl called eh
A	oh okay
B	because everyone else was with Erasmus students
A	mm hm
B	and I had with me
A	mm hm
B	and she was talking constantly in Spanish with me
A	fantastic
A	you had a right hotch potch of languages
B	oh I know
A	my friend
B	mm hm
A	and his English actually improved quite a lot when he was there but he learned fluent fluent Italian
B	I think
A	yeah
B	really similar that some sometimes you I'd be
A	mm hm
B	which was good
A	uh-huh
B	which it all like at university it was very dry
A	yeah more like studying it as opposed to learning how to use it
B	yeah and then I but I really enjoyed those classes
B	and they're just hoping that it's
A	but it is it's so similar
B	mm hm
A	to say something a certain way as if it's completely different
B	mm hm
A	and I hung out with a couple of Italian people and I was surprised that I could understand pretty much everything that they were talking about
B	yeah
A	because I spoke Spanish
B	yeah
A	and I spoke Spanish to them they understood and they'd speak Italian back to me and and I'd understand
B	and French helps as well if you've got French and Spanish then you can understand pretty much everything
A	yeah definitely
B	Cos there's a lot of crossover between them
A	mm
B	mm
A	it was funny
B	yeah that's like the
A	yeah
B	mm
A	mm last summer not the ones from the summer before
B	mm hm
A	but and I thought because they were  they were  art students they were all doing oh you know from the eh mine were fashion and
B	mm hm
A	interior design
B	mm hm
A	in English more than the students we'd had the years before who were doing business and stuff
B	yeah
A	but
B	it was hard over the summer though who who did they have to integrate
A	but they haven't
B	no
A	they've all joined the Chinese church and all of their social activities revolve around the Chinese church
B	really?
A	yeah
B	mm
A	they haven't you know made any English-speaking friends
B	mm
A	and all their status updates are in Chinese and it it's just such a shame cos
B	yeah
A	I understand during the presessional course
B	mm hm
A	you know they stick together cos it's a new a totally different situation for them
B	mm
A	it would be comforting to to have you know Chinese around them but they
B	yeah
A	it seems like they're doing it all the time
B	yeah
A	have they?
B	they're they're coming on really well
A	oh super
B	they are but
A	ah
B	mm
A	their written ability wasn't great but do do they speak English
B	yes
A	more in Taiwan?
B	they must do
A	eh
B	one or two had had been here before
A	mm hm
B	and maybe for like summer or something
A	and what are they doing? Are they em meeting up with their course mates and stuff and speaking English?
B	yeah they're just like writing things on Facebook in English and they have they seem to have friends from other nationalities
A	that's good
B	yeah
A	that's fantastic
B	yeah
A	and it sets them up with bad habits from the start
B	mm
A	and actually integrated into life in a family and kinda got a bit more exposed to the culture and embraced living in a different country
B	yeah that's and and separate them when don't let them choose the same roommates for a whole year
A	yeah
B	and get to separate and
A	mm
B	but the the people who have moved out it's like they were eh one
A	uh-huh
B	and they they're the ones who are doing better
A	yeah it's not surprising isn't it?
B	mm hm
A	that's the thing it was so difficult to improve their marks over the ten weeks of the course
B	mm hm
A	Cos you know
B	you're just speaking with well just in the class with us but then
A	and even then they weren't particularly forthcoming in speaking in English
B	I'm pretty good for the first couple of weeks they spoke nothing but English
A	mm hm
B	and then it's slowly slid into
A	as their social life
B	I don't know it is hard learning a language
A	mm
B	and apart from that I've never studied a language and then I suddenly started Spanish
A	but it must have been easier for you to learn a bit of Spanish because your brain was used to learning French?
B	yeah
A	I think just the the skill of of being able to memorise words and spot patterns even if you can't speak it fluently it's definitely
B	I don't know it's how how how easy it was to learn Italian
A	mm
B	not even just cos of the similarities but it was it just is easier the more you use that part of the brain
A	mm
B	I think it does get easier to
A	yeah
B	but it was funny cos every time I wanted to think of a Spanish word I think of the Italian word
B	or
A	are you going to classes for Polish or?
B	no
A	oh
B	his son's a better teacher than
A	was he brought up bilingual? His son?
B	no no no no
A	oh really?
B	but he came here when he was about three
A	oh okay
B	so yeah he's he speaks like Polish at home
A	uh-huh
B	but at school he's speaking English and he laughs at his Dad
B	I speak better English than you
A	do he have a little accent when he speaks English?
B	no
A	oh really?
B	yeah
A	oh
B	mm hm
A	I guess that's in that sensitive period for learning
B	yeah
A	learning the accent and stuff
B	mm
A	mm
B	he can write in English
A	oh
B	it is
A	mm hm
B	kind of sounds that you have to learn those
A	mm hm
B	it's the same in English isn't it when they learn phonetically there were certain sounds you just have to to learn
A	does
B	not really
A	uh-huh
B	more but I can say a a little bit
A	is it similar to Spanish at all?
B	no
A	no
B	oh there's one thing  is the same and
A	uh-huh
B	in Polish is plaga
A	what are the roots of the Polish language then are they similar to German or?
B	it's like Slavic language
A	eh okay
B	there's no similarity to German
A	mm hm
B	there's a few Latin words in there
A	mm hm
B	but eh no it's mainly Slavic
A	mm
B	then it's like it's just like shhh khhh shhhhk and lots of like those kind of sounds
A	that's like Czech
B	yeah
A	probably
B	yeah
A	I lived in Prague for a couple of months eh doing the teacher training
B	mm hm
A	and oh it was so difficult to learn pick up words just cos there's they seem so alien
B	I know
A	no
B	and one is thank you
A	that's like Chinese though isn't em cos it's tonal
B	no
A	mm
B	but to learn a whole new language
A	yeah
B	even if I just understand it rather than speak it
A	yeah
B	and with
A	oh
B	and when
A	mm
B	he was at work the last time they came and I ended up like saying something really embarrassing
A	oh yeah
A	I'm sure he found it endearing as opposed to insulting though
B	yeah things like that I'd I'd like to be able to just communicate a little bit with his family
A	mm
B	Cos I know on Skype it's like I just say hello how are you
A	but you understand more or less the the thread of the conversation when they're speaking?
B	yeah cos there are words that I understand now like I know work I know car I know airplane I know  I know  words
A	mm hm
B	but their grammar is so hard
A	really?
B	yeah
A	does it have a lot of tenses or is it?
B	it's em not tenses
A	mm hm
B	like
A	uh-huh
B	there's those things
A	oh the cases
B	yeah the case that's it the cases
A	is that called declining or something? Declining the verb
B	mm hm
A	at school and remember
B	it's that sort of cases
A	oh really? Nightmare
B	there are eight cases
A	oh
B	so it changes
A	ah
B	I don't know the endings of the verbs and that
A	that's so complicated
B	yeah
A	but that just makes
B	what is it German has eight cases and this one has seven
A	for a lot
B	it is
A	yeah
B	and then he says something else and it's like well why have you changed it for that?
A	yeah I remember the I I didn't  I didn't  even get my head around the concepts of the different cases
B	mm
A	but is it stuff like genitive accusative dative?
B	mm hm
A	mm hm
B	so I like trying to learn it
A	have you a teach yourself book?
B	I
A	mm
B	it's all in em Polish so I just
A	yeah
B	either
A	but you might find because you're hearing a lot of it em if you get a a teach yourself book and just start to become aware of all the different endings and all the different you know pick up some more vocabulary
B	yeah
A	with that ending
B	yeah
A	uh-huh
B	are you? No that's not how I learn best I think watching films in Spanish and being in the classroom just listening  just listening
A	mm
B	it helped me a lot
A	yeah
B	mm hm
A	but because I could put together a sentence quite easily em then people would think oh she speaks Spanish they'd just go brrrrr back
B	yeah
A	one tiny word can throw you
B	mm hm
A	and it was it wasn't it was all communicative in that every at the beginning of every chapter there was a little dialogue
B	mm hm
A	and then afterwards it picked apart of the dialogue in terms of vocabulary and the different little grammar bits that we use but as chunks not
B	yeah
A	okay we're gonna learn the present tense
B	yeah
A	was explained
B	yeah
A	to to be able to recognise a lot of speech
B	mm
A	oh bless you
B	bless you
A	oh
B	and I didn't see it and I was studying Italian at the time and that was really bizarre because I don't
B	mm
A	so we were  we were  pretty much operating in Spanish apart from me and the English girl we were talking English to each other
B	mm hm
A	but everything any kind of interaction with the French world had to come through me
B	oh no
A	I said yeah but look in
A	then again I remember in the first month I think I was in Spain I ordered toast with tomato on and I thought it was gonna come in slices of tomato and when it came with just yeah
B	like the tomato paste on
A	yeah
B	mm
A	and add olive oil and I was like where is the tomato? I ordered tomatoes and they were like it's there on it and I felt very put out
A	oh
B	so I had to soon learn to say can I have eh tea with milk separate
A	cold milk on the side
B	yes my friend was laughing she was
A	yeah no I always had em decaf in a sachet
B	mm hm
A	and just a cup of hot milk and I'd just sprinkle a bit of decaf coffee and
B	yeah
A	then again when I was in France I used to have em le petit noir like a tiny little cup of really intense coffee
B	I'm the same I never used to like coffee and then I worked in eh Costa Coffee and having it there I just tried it a few times and actually that's it's alright
A	yum yum yum yum
B	mm
A	but I never managed to develop a taste for seafood
B	oh it does
A	urgh
B	calamari
A	disgusting
B	I remember eh ordering some I was like I didn't recognise anything on the menu
A	mm hm
B	and I got this whole big it looked like a round squid
A	uh-huh
B	cos I said what is  what is  that? Like and he was explaining and what's that like and he was explaining and that one is like calamari
A	are those the little small rings?
B	mm hm
A	they
B	yeah
A	they do those well in Granada don't they?
B	mm and you have them sometimes with free with the as tapas part of the
A	eh the first time I visited Granada we arrived at the the bus station I think?
B	yeah
A	and got off the bus after a five hour rather worrying trip around all these very thin country roads on a mountain and worried that the bus was going to drop off so we went straight to the bar when we got off the bus and I just ordered a little beer
B	oh yeah
A	and I was like no we didn't ask for that no it's alright it's free eat it
B	that's great
B	he went to have his hair cut I mean not many people would go and do that would they? If you don't speak the language
A	my mum's quite my mum's the same but my dad is completely not
B	uh-huh
A	and there's my dad in the middle of the restaurant
B	eh hm
A	with no Spanish whatsoever
B	uh-huh
A	and she managed to communicate to the the chemist em that she needed ointment for the eye and then she said em it's for a cat meow meow
B	yeah it is funny
A	crazy
B	yeah he has actually
A	yeah
B	it seems to stop the em the symptoms
A	yeah
B	yeah they say for a few of the injections especially the ones with a live em virus
A	uh-huh
B	that he can
A	is that the super bug thing?
B	no it's the eh mumps measles and rubella
A	oh okay
B	and the injection having it all together em he can have the
A	uh-huh
B	but if em he has the injection he could possibly get one of the you know like mumps or something
A	mm hm
B	and he could be really ill and even have em convulsions
A	oh no
B	I mean it's a one in so many one in a million that it could happen to
A	uh-huh
B	but there is a small chance that it is just as dangerous as him getting the actual disease
A	right
B	I mean he's
A	yeah
B	I think that's the most that was the most dangerous one
A	mm
B	the MMR one
A	right
B	Cos it can cause problems if their their brain can swell and cause brain damage and things like that
A	lordy
B	and it must be horrible if and autism as well
A	mm
B	so it must be terrible if you do give your child the injection and you know and he was one of the ones that
A	mm hm
B	did have autism
A	do you need a towel or something?
B	I
A	where's your bag? Yeah
B	yeah
A	that's the one
B	mm no we got like a little muslin cloth
A	let's see
B	oh that's a wipe I'll use a wipe
A	oh gosh sorry
B	no it's okay
A	no he seems fine
B	he does
A	survived his traumatic experience
B	twice in one leg and once on other
A	aw
B	like that leg and chht that one
A	did he  Did he  scream every time they did it?
B	he was smiling at the nurse and then suddenly she like chhk and he was waaaaaa not a little
A	how dare you? You were smiling at me and then you hurt me
B	but I I did before I held him like this way and looking at him and I'm thinking well maybe he thinks it's me
A	yeah face the nurse face the nurse
B	it's her she did it
A	aw
B	sometimes
A	does he get like energetic?
B	it's because he's somewhere new and em he seems to be quite like oh what's that what's that? And he gets excited
A	do you notice does do babies normally get burped after a feed?
B	with breastfeeding not so much no
A	eh okay
B	it's not like with bottles where they can get a lot of air
A	uh-huh
B	breastfeeding they tend to not need it so much
A	it will come out
B	come out yeah
A	burpy burp burp
B	yeah he's not really a windy baby are you? Cos some some babies have it worse and they just need every stop burped stop burped
A	mm
B	but with bottles it's a lot worse
A	I guess you get a lot more air going in don't you?
B	yeah
A	he seems so placid though
B	he is
A	how does he compare to the babies of the other mums that you know?
B	em one or two like they can be a bit manic
A	do you recognise what he
B	yeah
A	and if he's in pain? Just can you tell?
B	yeah because you can't stop him crying with a toy or something
A	ah
B	so I just know it if you can't console him then must be something wrong
A	aw
B	I just had to carry him around in a
A	oh no
B	they said Calpol
A	no
B	no
A	that's what they use to dose up the babies in Victorian times
B	no because he's breastfeeding
A	uh-huh
B	and they don't last as long cos em bottle fed babies
A	do you want me to pull the curtain over?
B	it's like
A	there you go
B	it's like giving them a a Sunday dinner
A	mm
B	every time you feed them whereas breastfeeding they take how much they want
A	mm
B	and then they're em very quiet and that's why and it takes a while to digest it
A	mm hm
B	but with breast milk it can be digested within when they're younger an hour and they're hungry again
A	how many times do you have to get up in the night to feed him?
B	last night was a bad night
A	oh dear
B	we woke up quite a few times didn't we? But the night before he slept all the way through
A	how bizarre
B	yeah
A	very weird
B	yeah he does sometimes sleeps in bed with me
A	oh
B	especially when he's waking up so often
A	yeah
B	and then go back straight to sleep again
A	yeah definitely
B	so I can get up get him out and
A	do you find it quite easy to get back to sleep after?
B	yeah
B	Cos I put him to sleep in his bed

B	mm
A	so in the end that's you know
B	you did the the numbers?
A	this year it was really organised and all that took was printing out a few numbers wasn't it?

A	he makes a lot of eye contact actually
