D	you just ran away like I think I really upset you
B	yeah to make a mess somewhere else mm
unknown_female	yeah
B	you go and live in the woods

C	I want one of them
C	but I'm not allowed one apparently cos
D	because that would be dangerous to society
A	you shouldn't be allowed scissors let alone a gun
B	apparently it's frowned upon
D	is that what she says?
C	was that a comment about my fringe?
D	I was going to say I wouldn't put it past her
B	yeah I know
A	but now you
C	was that a dig at my fringe?
A	to be fair you didn't cut it around your eyebrows so yeah it was
C	I did a beautiful job and I'll do it again as well and I know that I will
C	I will do it again because I've got a full fringe now
A	but why did you cut it around your eyebrows?
C	well cos I right because I couldn't see cos I I'd taken
D	yeah I just don't understand that it was like you were trying to give yourself a bat signal
C	right I'd taken my glasses off and I couldn't see because I didn't want the hair to be touching my glasses and then I used nail scissors because I didn't know where my other scissors were
B	what?
D	obviously
C	but the but the panda
D	yeah cos nail scissors are
C	so yeah
D	it'll
A	so you had an M yeah
C	shut up
D	she was channelling a bit of James Bond
B	the Mcdonald's logo
C	it was the day before the Christmas ball didn't think that through did I? at all
B	no maybe not
C	have you seen the picture from the Christmas ball? they're fucking awful I look like a whale
B	all of
A	personal whale
A	do it take a picture of
D	no because he actually he actually got really upset about it
A	yeah he does
D	he got he got really upset about it to me
C	that's cos it's really mean there's absolutely no need in it like
B	yeah it is
A	he doesn't I don't think he likes
C	does anyone?
D	well I'm not surprised after that she called him
A	no like cos like I thought yeah that I'd be pissed off about but I didn't think he'd be like
D	no he was really upset about it
A	I know he was upset about it but
C	no because he he's he's really sensitive about his weight
A	mm mm
C	and like at the minute he's at like he said to me the other day he's at the biggest that he's been in a while
D	yeah
C	and he's not very cos he didn't he used to go to like Zumba and
D	mm
C	he used to go to that and he lost quite a lot of weight and then he just put it all back on again and he's like he's quite upset about it
D	yeah
B	mm
C	so that didn't really help cos like everyone wants to look good in their swimming costume
A	and he doesn't look he doesn't look bad though
C	no he's just got he's quite a big belly
A	well I don't
D	I think that were just really harsh of
A	mm I don't know why she's done it though
D	I don't know why she did that
A	cos I don't think she's done it maliciously
D	well maybe not but she wouldn't like it if I wrote on Facebook hashtag
A	well I don't know but I don't know what goes
B	yeah
A	I don't think she'd take that too fucking kindly
B	no
C	I think she thought he'd find it funny but
B	no
D	yeah but no that's not funny
B	mm no
C	no like I don't understand what goes through her head
D	especially not when he'd been calling himself a dolphin all holiday like all holiday he referred to himself as a dolphin
C	yeah or a torpedo
D	so then why would you then put a picture on Facebook and be like whale? if anything you'd put dolphin
A	or I just wouldn't put
C	cos he said to me as well he was like you wouldn't even you wouldn't even do that and I was like yeah because it's fucking harsh
A	yeah
C	I was like us making fat jokes at each other is like a private thing like and like our friends know we do it but like I wouldn't do it on Facebook
A	yeah
C	like that's just a bit of a step too far to be honest
C	I don't know
A	but I couldn't find it on her pictures
C	well if
D	she's got it somewhere hasn't she?
C	I'm trying to yeah it's still there

B	yeah and fucking knife it
A	ah
D	that will be me
A	nothing will ever be as funny as when my next door neighbours kicked a ball into our garden it hit my mum in the head
A	that was that was hilarious because right they weren't allowed to play in the back garden because they kept kicking the balls and they kept hitting my mum's flowers so they said they could play in the front garden so they were like they were just like messing about but the ball did keep coming over and then like they kicked it over and it hit her in the head and like she properly freaked out like full on effing and blinding and crying and screaming and everything like that
D	cos the ball
A	yeah
A	because if you kicked the ball
B	mm
A	so they learned not to do it because she'd just pop their balls and they're like the ones from like JJB Sports or whatever where they're like thirty quid or more I don't understand why you'd pay
D	who the fuck pays thirty quid for a
C	no they do it's ridiculous
A	no people pay more than that it's like thirty quid for a replica of the balls that they use and then it's like fucking like near on a hundred quid for like the actual ones
D	fuck off what is wrong with people? it's a ball
A	like my my cousins used to have like loads of different ones in their
B	like oh you need to get the new World Cup ball

B	mm
A	did anyone ever have one of those?
B	no
A	and then you put it there instead of a swing and you used to like swing yourself up and like swing about on it
B	no
D	no
B	no fuck
