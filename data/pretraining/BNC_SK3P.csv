A	well hang on and then let
B	and then it he he like gets stuck to a tennis ball because that's been in flowers and it had a certain radiation of pollen
A	okay
B	and then he got hit and
A	uhu
B	and then like when the people were there and they said now and a little kid said hi bee and then the bee said hi and then and then the mum said right don't move
A	oh no so tried to kill it
B	and he like and he and he got knocked back out of the engine and out of the car
A	my goodness
B	he it did hurt him because he was crying
C	and then
A	but you were saying that he fell in love with a human or something?
C	yes
B	yeah
C	and then he started flying towards the hive
A	uhu
C	but then it started raining
B	yeah bees can't fly in rain
A	oh yeah
C	and he finds a flower the next morning erm he found himself inside a window and then he and

A	oh
C	yeah and then he went into a kitchen and then they basically had a
A	but is that girl that he falls in love with?

B	well it's not a science problem
C	mum it's just a film
A	oh okay

A	okay
B	because it does include bees which are real and Winnie the Pooh
C	and er
A	and Winnie the Pooh
C	yeah

C	yeah
A	are we still in the same film?

A	it's in the Bee
C	yeah he's only one
B	because he's because he's eating honey
C	yeah and they and they still wanted to stop anybody eating from honey anybody eating from honey any anybody from eating honey and then the bee has stopped working and then all the plants and flowers die and then they have to start working again
