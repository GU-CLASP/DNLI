C	mm? that's alright
C	yeah there's a trampoline you look like you're kind of erm

D	still peeling
A	is she?
C	her and
A	yeah
C	I don't know how they erm
A	just had a tea
C	yeah
A	mm wow
C	and erm
A	but that's probably what keeps people going isn't it? is doing that stuff
C	yeah I've been worried about
A	oh
C	not being able to cope with something
A	yeah
C	couldn't hoover and I know they don't mind not hoovering for a while but erm I don't know nobody noticed I was getting a little bit concerned that people just don't notice cos they're so on top of things and
A	yeah yeah
C	they do need a cleaner really every now and again
A	yeah
C	but they refuse to have one erm
A	that's the trouble isn't it? what you may perceive them of as needing then people are very proud and don't want to
A	cos it it kind of signifies or it's coming to the end of independence you know? yeah
C	I know it's that it's that weird time would you be?
A	if somebody got me a cleaner I'd be like bring it on
A	where's my cook? where's my maid? where's? where's my PA?
C	loads of my friends have cleaners but they're all they've all got like partners as well and they can
A	yeah if you've got two incomes then
C	yeah and you both earn
D	like with that cleaner
D	somebody call in cleaning
C	my mum like it she feels she has to be another
A	I think everybody does don't they?
A	yes we settled on cheese and tomato we couldn't make a decision about
D	yeah there's some here
A	all the
D	triangle
A	it's it's very tough
D	triangle
A	it's really tough he goes through lots of phases my mum drove us up to the airport this morning and she did say that it's really starting to get to her now the the incontinences now sorry not a nice subject while you're eating but erm it's really starting to get to her now
C	yeah
A	because it's got worse you know? previously she could cope quite well with the Alzheimer's do you want another slice of pizza darling? help yourself then erm because my dad just sleeps most of the time it's part of the epilepsy and the epilepsy medication he just sleeps all the time he's quite capable of sleeping all through the day all through the evening getting up for some food
C	does he always? is it?
D	well what's the point in? doesn't sound like much quality of life you're asleep all the time
A	he's a man with Alzheimer's and epilepsy you know?
D	oh it's your dad has the Alzheimer's?
A	huh?
D	I thought it was your mum had the Alzheimer's
A	no no no my dad
C	my mum and my aunt starting to get dementia they think and she's starting to sleep loads as well
A	really? mm it's part of the condition and it's coupled with epilepsy and coupled with the medication
C	does it? has he always had epilepsy?
A	he was diagnosed about four or five years ago
C	oh right so is it something that occurs with Alzheimer's?
A	mm I don't know actually I don't know I've always treated it as a separate thing
C	mm
A	you know? she's out and about all the time cos he's asleep in the day
C	yeah
A	she just gets herself home for the evening you know where she gets him up and in fact now I think it's starting to change cos she's having to do loads of laundry and it's just depressing that kind of thing you know?
C	yeah does she have anyone come in like a nurse?
A	yeah that's taken a lot of persuading but it it's on an ad hoc basis cos she can't predict
C	oh
A	and she obviously has her own health things
C	yeah
A	erm which again is sporadic you know?
C	yeah
A	cos she has erm melanoma
C	yeah
A	so sometimes it's
C	yeah
A	so
D	do you want more pizza
A	my dad's been in and out of respite care usually when my mum had an operation or when she goes away
A	and erm
C	mm
D	and do you have to pay for that over there?
A	oh my god you wouldn't believe it do you know how much it is?
D	thousand a month thousand a month
C	three hundred a week
A	a thousand a week
D	a week?
C	oh my god a thousand a week
A	a week
D	but hang on that's fifty-two grand a year I could pay someone to just live with
C	you could pay for a full time nurse and a hotel room obviously wouldn't but like you know what I mean?
A	that's that's the top end of things and the kind of not-so-great care home is between seven hundred and fifty and eight hundred you will not get cheaper
D	sorry? a week or a month?
A	a week
D	but
A	I know I know
D	that's almost a one-to-one basis
A	I know I mean it is the the place where he has this respite care
C	not even a good one
A	erm
D	none of that is covered by insurance presumably
A	no no because it's just a
A	I know I know
C	did they erm? did
A	the way it works
A	because because my mum lived in the house they can't touch the house cos that's her home and she has a cancer diagnosis as well so they double can't touch her so when their savings are exhausted
C	yeah
A	then the state will step in to a degree
C	okay
A	but you're expected to contribute still some of that
D	how? how much of a degree?
A	I don't know but it's means-tested
D	so why doesn't she just give all her money to you?
A	well
D	sorry
A	I have no no no no you're right she has given me seeing as we're talking quite frankly about these things she has given me fifty grand and I think she's given my brother fifty grand
D	apart
B	how?
D	so like she'll have no moves like as a mechanism or just here's before I waste it all?
A	she gave it to me
D	cos what?
D	it was more I'll give it to my two children before I lose it all
A	but you have to do that by law within seven years it's the seven year rule so if they see that you've done that within that seven years that's still counts against you
D	it's a bit like abating your creditors in bankruptcy or something
A	it's really
C	that was over seven years ago was it?
A	no it was only in in January she gave it to me so it's very very punitive we do need to have another proper conversation about it because I think the reality is that because there's a lot of equity in the house
C	yeah
A	you know it's a house in
C	mm
A	so we need to really
D	who likes it?
A	but I think the reality is that we have to sit down and look at erm the equity in the house cos the house is worth
C	yeah
A	three hundred and fifty-four hundred thousand you know?
C	yeah
A	and they own it outright there's no mortgage or anything like that so we do have to look very carefully at this huge asset really and what we do with it
C	yeah
A	no
C	maybe get some proper financial advice
A	yeah I think that's what we need to do now cos I think we've both been trotting it off because it's not very nice talking about that stuff nobody likes it erm we'll see
E	how much money do you have to pay off
D	half a million
E	more
D	half a million
B	mummy?
A	yes darling
A	can you not get it?
E	how much was it?
F	ah
D	oh right well he's had he's had a lot already but
E	come get them you can get a very good Lamborghini for that much
D	yeah but you see
A	you can live in your Lamborghini
C	we we were we were told you have to
A	yeah
E	now we could go and
C	might not work right
A	I mean I've I in my head I you know? because I'm the only sibling living in the country
C	mm
A	and living so close by I have seriously considered moving in there at some point
D	why? where's your brother?
A	you know?
A	erm
D	sorry without being horrible like
A	you see this is the unknown me me and my mum do have we have had this rather frank conversation
D	I just mean more from a medical perspective
A	yeah
D	than
A	well when my dad was in respite care we did talk about it and and we did say god isn't this awful we're talking about somebody's life in terms of money and
A	you just never know
F	what?
A	you know? Alzheimer's is a degenerative disease but you simply don't know I mean I come from a family with a history on both sides of living for a long time my dad's grandmother lived till she was ninety
D	and does something like Alzheimer's? it doesn't actually affect your mortality in that kind of way does it?
A	it is degenerative so it
D	and what what age is he?
A	you know?
D	what age is he?
A	erm seventy-three
A	my parents are both the same age they're both seventy-three I mean you know? it could be
D	ah that's terrible
A	it is awful but you have to think yeah yeah mm absolutely I know it is awful and what they've inherited as well cos they've both inherited from their parents but I mean I agree with you it it is outrageous
A	yes but you must eat the salad as well darling that's not an option that's erm
D	what would you like?
D	yummy
F	yummy
E	yummy yummy
A	they they did they did sort of scrimp and save through their twenties thirties forties but definitely into their fifties absolutely so much travelling they've done more travelling than me and
D	do you want some of that?
A	so it's not like they have never been anywhere you know?
C	yeah
E	ah I feel better
A	but yeah I think I think after that conversation this morning I think me and my mum need to really sit down and really properly as we have done in the past but now this is a different stage as well
C	yeah
A	cos it's not fair on my mum
D	and what age is your mum?
A	mm?
D	what age is your mum?
A	same age they're both they're two months apart
C	that's good you feeling better?
A	perked up a bit? you were just really hungry I think
D	is she mentally
F	yummy
A	mm?
E	that's weird cos I didn't think I was hungry
A	my mum?
D	mm
A	oh I see I thought you said is my mum mentally competent
D	no
A	it's not like it's just okay for
F	yummy
A	and I've had time to
F	what? what?
A	plan a bit do you know what I mean? as and weigh up the possibilities
F	what? what?
A	the way I see it is if that's what's easier for my dad and my mum that's what we do
F	red red
E	red
C	mm
A	do you know what I mean? I don't mean to sound like a martyr
C	yeah
A	but I that's how I see it I think it's easier
D	and I suppose if you're being
A	and it means that my mum would have somebody else
A	it means that my dad gets to stay in his own home it means that it's utterly less stress on me because at least I can see what's happening right there you know? rather than worrying about what I don't know
D	and you're you'd have no rent either
C	do you mind passing the salad?
A	so I don't know we'll we'll see it's a big
C	yeah
A	but it wouldn't be I mean I wouldn't be the first person that's had to do that you know?
C	yeah
A	it's it's what you sometimes have to do isn't it? you know?
C	yeah
A	I don't know
D	but even at those prices
A	I have said this to my mum about getting a sort of live-in nurse
D	you know? well even if they were there a lot my point was that
D	it would make it easier for everybody and it would be a fraction of the price
A	yeah
C	I agree
A	but I think it's when you see what it's like day-to-day at home
C	yeah
A	do you know what I mean? and
C	mm
A	it would cost a lot of money to adapt it and it it's the toll on my mum as well
C	and nights at night time
A	at night times because he might start developing the kind of Alzheimer's where he does start wandering
C	yeah
A	or you know? you just don't know
E	sleepwalking you can
A	what's that?
A	yeah like sleepwalking
E	you can get a chairlift upstairs
A	you can you're right
C	yeah yeah
A	but yeah it's

C	I think it was already a thing
E	ah cos like I started doing that
D	you may have taught him first
E	for some reason he doesn't like laughing I don't know
D	he's very sensitive to sound
A	he is isn't he? is he really sensory as well? does he like different textures and things like that?
D	erm
A	cos that often goes with if you're sensitive to sound that often goes with that

D	we'd be worried this is the autistic part of him this kind of crap when he's getting
E	huh?
A	we were me and
D	well everyone's on the spectrum somewhere
A	that's that's what I was saying to
C	what?
D	like it's balanced by this kind of severity and his
A	his eye contact looks good his interaction is he's having fun he's laughing
C	yeah I do think he's going to be really you know some some kids
C	I don't think he's going to have a very hard time
D	well actually
C	yeah and they they're not then they don't have hardly any eye contact yet

unknown_female	shh

E	yeah I
A	ah
D	okay
unknown_female	shh
E	I taught him that good night
F	oh
A	ah that's nice
E	and then and then I'd I'd pretend to go to sleep and then he'd something say something like man U or something like
E	I don't know what he's saying
C	but it is a bit like you're like
D	yeah
E	mm?
A	which is the opposite of most kids
D	if we could
A	my friend
D	two that's ridiculous
