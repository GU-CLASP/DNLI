A	I mean how many settees do you throw out per year?
B	yes exactly
A	but they won't pick up fixtures like baths showers
B	ah now I meant to ask you about that because I've I've given up the notion of having it done in this expensive way did I tell you how much it was going to cost me? eight thousand pounds
A	you said it was over eight thousand pounds I've had both of mine done for just under four thousand pounds
B	are you happy with them?
A	well you can come and see it if ever you want to upstairs
B	I'll take you up on that if I may
A	you may come up and look the only thing I haven't done is decorate it I mean he's tiled the floor he's put in new erm you know not
B	the pedestal and the WC
A	yeah
B	bloody hell
A	all the accoutrements he even put in a new light for me which I bought
B	yeah yeah
A	from the electrics he's re tiled everything that was tiled
B	yes
A	er he's ripped up the old floor he's put in a new floor
B	bloody hell
A	and he's done downstairs as well erm
B	and all for less or about four thousand pounds
A	roughly four
B	both of those together?
A	roughly four thousand pounds
B	did you have to buy the materials?
A	that's including
B	that's including materials?
A	the
B	mm
A	the tiles and so on that was about nine hundred and ninety pounds or something which I gave him months ago so that he could go buy them
B	yeah he could just go and buy them
A	he even fitted
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	the last thing he did was
B	yes
A	you know on a little piece of cord
B	yes yes
A	and I happened to notice that it was wearing through
B	right
A	because they always
B	frayed they fray that's right
A	they get frayed he said oh all we got to do he said is take the unscrew it
B	yes
A	and then you can re wire it
B	that's right exactly
A	re tie it well he took it off himself he said you can't they they it's a switch you have got to buy a whole new thing
B	oh right
A	last day he turned up for work which was with my was Monday
B	yes yes yeah
A	whether he whether he works up in
B	it might just be worth his while for that kind of money cos otherwise it's you know two hour not kind of two hours
A	well he lives in
B	well that is two hours then
A	yeah yeah I suppose so
B	well about an hour and
A	I don't know how far afield he works and he works more than I mean I  it took me something like five months to get him because he was booked up
B	ah yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	well so much so that I'm gonna have him back in about year's time to do my kitchen
B	book him now and then you have him in
A	yeah he's even told me how to get it done cheaply
B	well kitchens are necessarily going to be more expensive because of all the appliances all the gas and so on and so on
A	yeah exactly yeah so
B	good for him
A	and he's he's a carpenter basically and he does and he well he does kitchens and bathrooms
B	that's very good but why did he have to change your bath? baths are usually pretty
A	well you see again it just annoyed me
B	okay
A	because it's it's as old as the house now I've been there since two thousand and the house was about seven years old then so
B	mm mm was it a plastic one rather than a metal or ceramic one?
A	well erm the bath was plastic
A	anyway but the thing was it was it was like a light blue colour and the one downstairs was like a a sort of a pale yellowy colour well I'd just put white in there
B	okay
A	erm and my brother bless him did the tiling upstairs in the guest bathroom
B	that's very good of him
A	but unfortunately neither he nor I knew that you can't put ceramic tiles onto a wooden floor unless you
B	ah have a a some
A	cos what happens is all all the gunge between the tiles starts to crack
B	yes
A	it looked okay but you know to my eye
B	yeah yeah
A	but to anyone else it's like
B	mm but it's just not flat enough if it's a wooden floor
A	no that's right so erm
B	mm
A	I was very pleased with what he's done
B	mm
A	erm yeah
B	well I mean tradespeople like that you grab onto them because you otherwise it's
A	well as I said he he worked for next door
B	yeah
A	and he worked with my neighbours next door in their original house and when they moved into this one they
B	yeah
A	and they showed me what he'd done and I just thought well I'm not gonna go running around now getting
B	exactly yes
A	so I I grabbed hold of him sometime in May or June and we agreed that we would do it in late September early October
B	I imagine he uses less upmarket materials because it can get very expensive furnishing bathrooms
A	oh I could of spent four thousand pounds on the bath
B	yes yes
A	and the taps and goodness knows whatever else in fact I didn't choose them I just said
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	but he's got me mixer taps everywhere
B	yeah
A	and I've got cut off valves whereas before
B	mm mm
A	I'd have to turn one off from the main thing but now I've got cut off valves on everything toilet bath because they weren't there you see as standard
B	is your bath as it was
A	no it's got a it's got a slide it's got a
B	you can take it off easy?
A	you can take that off easily it's just a couple of screws
B	right well that's already an improvement on
A	yeah
B	at the base of the outside wall on the bathroom and I thought what the hell's going on? I just couldn't figure it out in my mind at all cos it was nowhere near the the shower end it was the
A	mm
B	if you like the the head end of the bath on the outside you know the corridor wall inside my inside the flat and I got it into my head that it was leaking from the bottom of the bath
A	right
B	don't know how it could possibly do that there and I thought well I'll just take off the side panel of the bath
A	yeah
B	but the side panel was a mirror or is a mirror
A	oh right
B	and behind the mirror there was a
A	that is strange
B	very strange just
A	so you didn't find out why this
B	no I called a plumber in and he scratched his head and he said well in fact it's nothing to do with the under side of the bath the problem is in the taps the head of the bath
A	mm
B	and the water is somehow finding its way all along the rim of the bath and going down and staining the bottom of the
A	oh right
B	he had to put the er yeah he fixed it easily enough he just changed the
A	yeah right
B	and then put the erm the wooden bit back on I I asked him kindly if he would put the mirror back on and he demurred and he said well we don't really touch mirrors and I said well look you know
A	mm
B	give me a hand and we'll be alright so he very kindly did put it
A	right okay
B	against the er the side of the bath
A	yeah
B	but then it was left to me to
A	to to screw that on
B	to then screw it on but screwing glass
A	mm that can shatter
B	yeah
A	well er with
B	yeah yeah
A	so it is like the Pompidou Centre or
A	and erm
B	mm
A	but since it's in there I can do all of this do you want me to hide it all? and so it's got dug into the wall and then he put the tiles
B	much better
A	over it
B	much better
A	it isn't a problem he he he does
B	sure
A	all the electrics and all the rest of it erm and then at one point I said to him oh that lamp you know it's one of those awful sort of lamps and
B	yeah
A	erm I could of done it myself but erm you know why bother when you have got someone who really knows his stuff
B	no no absolutely not
A	so he's changed two lights for me he has done electrical work
B	mm
A	whereas he gets his plane out and
B	yes yes yes yes yes
B	that's right that's right
A	and he even told me about the best way to put the preservative on it he said half and half he said turpentine
B	mm
A	and you know
B	right
B	right right right okay
A	bloody hell I didn't know about that you know?
B	I know I know
A	so that's what I did over the weekend you know a sort of a a wash and then
B	yes
A	yes exactly yeah yeah
B	they get the brush out and dab some stuff all over a piece of wood we can do that we can't plane
A	yeah that's right yeah we could do that
B	at least I could not plane
A	well I don't know I don't even have a plane so
B	probably
A	yeah exactly so erm and he was saying the tiles you know suddenly he said
B	yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	so you know I think it is better if we start here and when you come in the eye will see everything geometric and we can hide the
B	square yeah
A	it won't be going like that it'll be going like this down there yeah that's fine you know?
B	yeah right again people like us will just start from the bottom
A	yeah that's right
A	and the other thing too of course is he completely tiles the whole floor and then the stand for the wash basin and the actual toilet itself
B	mm
A	sits on it he does not have to cut around it you see
B	oh right
A	it sits on the tiles and then you get that clear view sealant all the way round the bottom of it
B	right because of course the pipes don't go through the tiles the pipes go through the wall
A	yeah at the back yeah
B	okay yeah yeah yeah
A	they're at the back so I mean the the where the affront goes out he has had to cut round that
B	yes that is right
A	but that's largely hidden by the toilet anyway
B	that's good
A	mm
B	you could also apparently get these days get very thin erm
A	yeah yeah er low flush or small
B	exactly someone who got
A	erm I think I have certainly downstairs because he was saying that he had to baton on the wall because it would not fit on the wall cos it's different
B	mm
A	the one I had was so much
B	yeah
A	bulkier and of course you can't just stick it on the wall because it's got to fit over the toilet
B	right
A	you know so he's had to put a baton on it but that isn't a that is the problem so it stands about that far off the wall but by the time you've painted that baton the same colour as the wall it's just got
B	you won't see it no exactly absolutely that's right
A	I mean downstairs
A	but you go upstairs
B	yeah and that that's more fully done right?
A	you go upstairs and you might even think the upstairs has been decorated
B	mm
A	although it hasn't just at that the tiling
B	been put in mm
A	fits in more exactly with the old tiles if you see what I mean erm but as I say you you're you're welcome to come along and
B	very good
A	but erm
B	another er embellishment which I was offered which hadn't occurred to me I did not know that things existed was a slow drop toilet seat
A	I've got two of those
A	it is really boring though because
A	they don't just go
B	no?
A	they just go
B	okay
A	and you think oh life's too short
A	you come back five minute's later oh yeah it's down it's really that bad you know?
B	erm can they be in emergencies overridden?
A	oh I see what I
B	okay right right
A	yes I take your point
A	that could that could be awkward yeah
B	yes without
A	but I mean they are not expensive I mean as I said
B	okay
A	if you think of all the sanitary wear and size and everything it was nine hundred and something nine hundred and sixty-nine hundred and seventy pounds or something like that
B	well you could as I was saying you could spend thousands of pounds
A	yeah
B	in the kind of er bathrooms you see in Country Life you know and those sort of er
A	yeah yeah but you've gotta have the you need the space for that too
B	yes that is right
A	and he said well you've never heard of Houghton's probably he said because they don't deal with the public they only deal with people like me
B	that is right that's right that's right
A	and I said well how am I going to get it then? and he said well you tell them that you're working through me and then they'll sell it to you so I thought so they sell it to me at wholesale? he said yes great
A	who gets to design it? he said they'll come and design it for free
B	oh
A	they'll come to your house and design for free cos they know that
B	oh that's interesting
A	he said don't worry I
B	yeah yeah
A	and get a price and show me the plans so that I can it you know it's feasible obviously and tell them you are not buying it until the sale and they have one sale a year and it's in October
B	very good very true
A	but it is like he said if you want marble worktops
B	yeah yeah sure sure sure sure
A	there's ten thousand pounds already
B	yeah sure sure sure
A	so I shall be
B	I'm sure they're very nice
A	I'm sure they are but I have got ones that look like marble
A	no no
B	when I put down a too hot pan
A	ah
B	and of course it blistered so
A	well of course you chefs
A	ah no but in my case it's bringing something out of the oven with oven gloves and you know yeah I see what you mean
A	yeah I know what you mean about
B	exactly what what er the builder who we got for my mum who is very pleased with him said look don't go to B and Q or Wilks or whatever they're called er Wicks Wicks
A	Wicks yeah
B	because A they're they're not very good and B they are expensive
A	that is right
B	so he took me to this place which of course in some out of the way industrial estate somewhere
A	that is right it is the same in
A	no no no
B	sure
A	well they'll they'll come out and do the design apparently they'll come out and measure it because you you'd be mad to measure it yourself
B	oh god yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	you know because if you're out by that much you know
B	yeah by by a an inch the whole thing imagine fitting an appliance in a space which is too small for it
A	yeah yeah
B	sure while you're doing it do everything
A	so he is going to do it all
B	absolutely that's right
A	and apparently they also supply the erm appliances er if you want to buy them from Houghton's er erm
B	there's no need because appliances can be got anywhere they're all of a standard size
A	yeah that that well that's true you can but I mean what I'm saying is he will fit it
B	yes sure he'll fit it that's right
A	nowadays with gas things it is just a case of uncoupling the thing and
B	yes that's right
A	erm
B	but your my memory of your kitchen wasn't it was perfectly alright
A	no it is perfectly alright but again it's
B	of the er of the era yes alright
A	and I think
A	don't be too insulting
B	these days a first world problem
A	well I mean think south Wales is probably
A	one and half
A	we're not quite third world we we're certainly not third world
B	alright it's aspirational that's right
A	you know the the working class boy is still in there you know
A	yes well we never used to have one actually yeah actually that's er you've put me in my place now you you've shamed me
B	that's right but there are such things
A	I don't think I will have one of those no I I've got a dishwasher
B	it's meant for people who cannot be bothered to wait for the kettle to boil
A	I can wait for the kettle to boil yeah
B	you can okay that is something you've learnt over over the years
A	yeah I can I don't use my
B	you've got delayed gratification
A	I don't use my kettle that often
A	except when I've got workman in and then I have to find the sugar as well you know
B	right okay yes yes that's right
A	in a Tupperware box hidden somewhere in the back of one of the one of the cupboards
B	yes that's exactly right yes non sugar households have only got cubes usually
A	yeah
B	and they're somewhere inaccessible you know you put them away somewhere
A	then you think can sugar go off? does it go off? no no it does not have a shelf life
B	yellow is fine
A	yellow is fine well a green is dangerous
B	yeah yeah certainly
A	yes
B	okay well I shall very kindly
A	I was very pleased
B	I'll take up your very kind offer if I may at some point?
A	not at all you're more than welcome more than welcome
B	good excellent
A	erm and of course I mean if you if you strip out some of his labour and some of the other costs I I I don't know if I could do that guest bathroom cost considerably less than four thousand pounds
B	I mean what do you buy as the package? I'm
A	yeah
B	I'm exactly in your position I don't want to engage with it all other than say I'd like it to look like this
A	mm
B	arrange it so let it be so
A	well I was shocked when you showed me cos you had that 3D view
B	yes yes
A	and I thought your place is a similar size to mine and I thought when you said it was eight thousand something or other and I was beginning to wonder well yeah even if you have it tiled from top to bottom that's not eight thousand pounds
B	no it it's it's the price of the
A	yeah
B	er and the materials out of which they're made
A	right okay
B	er the tiles are extremely expensive they look lovely but then
A	yeah
B	that's because they are coroda marble or whatever it might be
A	well yeah yeah I know but it's like anything else I went to Topps Tiles you know
A	cos I I you know to to choose something and I was bewildered by their choice
B	the choice
A	and in the end I just thought black
B	right er and you could have gone up down left right in terms of price
A	oh I could still be there now
B	yeah yeah
A	and I I thought this I'm not even gonna use this you know I mean I just want something presentable for guests
B	yes right okay yeah
A	it's black and then I thought I could save myself some money it'll be black downstairs in the little toilet
B	as well
B	yes are only one piece of the jigsaw you could save a bit of money
A	mm
B	or you can not save a bit of money but if you
A	yeah
B	have it all at the cheapest rate it'll look cheap on the other hand if you have all at the expensive rate it will be astronomic
A	yeah
B	fine that's all you want
A	you know erm it's the kind of thing where if somebody said yeah you can use that wall there you wouldn't worry about it
B	yes you wouldn't feel embarrassed by yes
A	and I'm thinking mm
B	yes yes that's right
A	so yeah I'm very pleased with him what he's done anyway
B	good good good that's good to know
A	I sent erm
B	good
A	I didn't manage to get in touch with her unfortunately but I sent her a card
B	good good good good
A	I have asked
B	that that'll be very welcome I think
A	yeah yeah I I put a first class stamp on it today is Tuesday isn't it? so she may have got it by now
B	good
A	I
B	right
A	you know if first class stamps mean anything
B	I'm seeing
A	oh do give them my best regards
A	yes
A	what's he doing?
B	he's doing bits and bobs like sometimes people do when they you know stop doing the actual full time job consultancy
A	yeah
A	see that's what
B	mm mm
A	you know still getting some reasonable income out of it as well you know cos he's got those
B	well he's got the book
A	yeah well I know that that makes him a fortune
B	and he's I think my memory of it was when I met him in the wherever it was the bookshop he said he's got a helper on it or more than one helper
A	I think he may have actually I mean he's doing another version of it
B	yes
A	why wouldn't you?
B	well wouldn't you? sure
A	I mean it's earning him tens of thousands
B	absolutely right if he gets somebody to do the legwork he's very he's assiduous about updating that
A	well no I agree but you know I was going to say differential equations but you know
B	no no er
A	I think
B	sure sure sure sure sure
A	or some new study showing
B	yes
B	true true true
A	but you know you know the various tests
B	no but his if it if it's the one I'm thinking of of
A	yeah yeah I no I think that's one of the reasons why it sold so much
B	yes
A	it's got not just the you know the statistical techniques but
B	yes sure
A	applied in the real world you know that's what makes it such a good book I mean it seems to be on every methodologically reading list I've ever come across you know
B	well talking of differential equations there was a story in the Guardian yesterday
A	yeah
B	er an obituary about a
A	mm
B	who'd written the text books on calculus
A	oh
B	and you think well sell a few thousand I suppose he sold five hundred thousand a year
A	good god all round the world I take it?
B	all round the world and he was a multi millionaire
A	oh my you wouldn't think so would you? calculus like that you just wouldn't think so
B	if you write it both for universities and for schools two different versions and it's you know the the best one there is
A	see there was a book on A level economics that was like too but I can't think of the name of it now
B	was it Lipsy?
A	Lipsy it was Lipsy
B	ah we had Lipsy too there you are
A	yep
B	I'm sure they'd still
A	I mean he's dead but I mean it's still Lipsy
A	and then tiny print written like down
B	erm
A	yeah
B	it's never too late
B	yes yes
B	see you later
A	thank you very much for the coffee see you later
B	cheers mate
