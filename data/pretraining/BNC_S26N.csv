C	mm
A	yeah yeah erm so I was asked this week by some kids at school do I know somebody called
A	and it was like well I know a lot of
B	no
A	name erm
B	does he?
A	and I'm thinking well how's he hanging around with them if they live in
B	yeah yeah
C	yeah
A	so
B	that's a bit weird innit?
A	yeah
B	that's rain?
C	yeah

C	because you tend to go ah
A	oh yeah
C	there's a lot a lot we've got to delete
B	a lot we've got to get rid of yeah
C	yeah and er cos funnily enough each little cove was slightly different although mainly the rocks are all the same colour and that erm they were slightly different weren't they? in how they how they react and stuff yeah
B	and er I think in one of the coves we went to
A	all the big rocks?
B	big rocks
A	yeah
B	they got to the top of the cliff and tipped all these rocks down and they were a totally different colour to the normal rocks
C	oh like like concrete bits you know just
B	yeah
C	that's that's so silly I mean there's so many rocks there anyway
B	you'd have thought they'd have used those
C	why to have something different
B	tipped all these other ones down
C	it wasn't too much was there but?
B	no but that
C	it was obvious
B	that looked looked stupid
C	you know mm
