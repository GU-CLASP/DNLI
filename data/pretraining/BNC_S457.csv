C	probably a lie in
B	I mean you do speak to them then?
A	he couldn't what get into a hostel?
C	yeah
B	right and where's the nearest hostel?
C	people were people were going up to him and asking him why
A	you don't know and you've spoken to him?
C	yeah he's a young lad really or a young-ish lad
A	he's a man then
C	mm
A	mm
B	he'll probably be all round you just don't know them do we?
C	he couldn't get in anyway
B	why?
C	I'm not sure because er
B	oh
C	no
B	no
C	I say hello and that's about it
B	do you buy him a coffee?
C	no but
B	yeah I was gonna say
A	well
C	mm
B	getting coffee
B	he would not do that
C	and then of course you get the
A	ask you that?
C	yeah
B	when's he gonna get a job?
C	why doesn't why doesn't he do something useful
A	so everybody else thinks he's a he?
C	I would have said he cos I think it's a he but er
A	mm
B	did
A	I don't think so I didn't it was gonna be embarrassing but
A	I was sat opposite
B	for Monday?
A	yes
C	yeah
A	erm and he'd got
B	yeah
A	he's got the title of the essays
B	what because he's on holiday he doesn't have to do his homework?
A	yeah
B	ah
A	cos they will fine you
B	yeah okay that's fair enough yeah
A	I thought it was fair enough and then she said however
B	that's the other side
A	yeah
B	a bonus
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	you insist we take our holiday in school time he's had the holiday so therefore he hasn't been he hasn't been doing homework
B	but then
A	no why should they?
B	oh yeah
A	even so I just I think it's fair comment to ask for a few more days
B	I see what you mean but
A	I I'd I'd fight the school over that
B	well I do think that
A	if they're fighting you over days off in school time I'd fight them over that without a shadow and
C	I think he could have done it all the Friday night before he came out
A	well he had Saturday morning as well but that's just
B	and the Sunday night as well
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	so he did have three nights
A	or the Sunday
C	he probably could have done it
B	yeah
A	but I still think I'd have asked for an extension
B	yeah but mum when you're in GCSE year
A	yeah well
B	and you've got exams that count haven't you in GCSE?
A	anyway the the point of it was talking about the next table
B	oh
A	he was just being funny but we had a laugh they were all teachers on that table and we were discussing the fact that teachers are unfair
C	yeah
A	he was a nice lad but it was
B	do you think they er were or do you think he was just having you on?
A	no no I'm sure they were teachers
C	yeah they were
A	but he was just erm
B	yeah
A	you're right next to you feel like you're all on the same table
B	oh
C	well it was quite funny that was
A	I don't know when do his he's got
B	they'll be around now
C	probably
A	why don't you leave it?
B	cos it could be something important
C	cos I couldn't not
A	oh
B	it could be
A	every single day
C	she
B	mm
A	every day
C	hello mum

B	I do try and text her and she doesn't reply
C	she's a bit more friendly
A	she's alright

A	you've got to make the effort as well
B	yeah I know all of my birthday I was trying to talk to her and I sat next to her at the table and she didn't reply
A	no she didn't bother mm
B	you can tell when somebody wants to talk to you and she didn't want to talk to me so
A	well it's
C	yeah well
B	I just
A	there's nothing I can do about that
B	I know yeah but it's just it's just one of them isn't it?
A	mm
B	it's just another
A	I thought she was
B	moody family member
A	she was alright I thought
B	not not nan though
A	well no and she won't be the same again I don't think not after everything that's happened I just don't think she will I just don't think it's
B	but I'm quite happy to just literally
A	yeah but it's in her makeup
B	and just talk to her now
A	it's in her genes look at the entire family they're all like that
A	she was a miserable so and so
B	and you're more like grandad aren't you?

B	mm good
A	just be your auntie
B	I hope it's not you
C	their loss
A	my mum's just erm you've just got to get on with it but she is always gonna be a bit more miserable now I think
B	it's just weird
A	had she called
C	she said she mentioned something about I've got the AVG with
A	oh fine
C	and I think it was that she'd done it and it was fine
A	but she didn't ask him about the printer then?
C	well he did it
A	yeah but I said to her if she's gonna call him she may as well ask him if he's got any ideas at what she could do to clear the printer
C	oh I didn't ask that I don't know
A	what are you looking at?
B	just Instagram
C	four hundred
B	bits of everything really

A	you said that when are they?
C	whereabouts?
B	we we haven't got it our franchise hasn't got it and
C	where is it? whereabouts are you going?
B	I'm not sure where it's going it's up to the new
C	so a big a big unit then
A	is it gonna be where they're extending that ground you know behind the erm
B	possibly you know yes well I know where
A	you know you know where they've done the roadworks?
C	oh
A	yeah by the New Look
B	by New Look
A	so that's I mean there's there or there's over by erm
B	mm
A	over the Next or John Lewis side but I don't think it'd be any good over there it needs to be in the main shops doesn't it?
B	I reckon it'll be there yeah
A	who's having it?
B	it's definitely going cos
C	compete don't they?
B	compete for it and our franchise hasn't won this one
A	oh right I think it'll do well there
B	oh yeah well like I said it's well we all know that's why they're gutted they haven't got it
A	oh right
B	they'll do really well there
A	well it's like why would you put one there? and I thought well actually why wouldn't you?
B	why yeah
A	I think it's a perfect place for they've got no jewellery stores at all
B	it's absolutely
A	they've got loads of shoppers of that you know
B	yeah
A	of your target market
B	yeah it'll be absolutely rammed
A	they'll make a killing
B	no
A	you know you are in the flagship store
B	yeah no
C	I wonder how big that'll be then cos it's all those units are quite big down there aren't they?
B	mm
C	with Boots and that and you've Next and that
A	well it's not gonna be that big is it?
B	like like mum said on that
B	do you know you know by New Look there yeah I reckon
B	yeah it's a shallow
A	mm
B	it'll probably be quite long I'm not sure
A	everybody coming out of Kentucky Fried Chicken or whatever it is around there
B	yeah it is KFC and Costa and
C	Costa
B	Roasters
C	Marks and Spencer's
B	yeah
A	with every one?
B	the majority yeah
A	is there one on the high street? is the is the high street in
B	yeah
A	is it?
B	yeah and they're opening a new one as well
C	have you have you got some sort of a connection with them then
B	no I don't think so
C	or they're just by
B	I think our franchise likes to always go next to a Primark
C	so
B	but Primark's Primark is our customer like you say it's not expensive
A	well it's fairly expensive
B	it's fairly expensive but it's a treat isn't it? and they'll spend all of their money on getting a charm
A	mm
C	true
A	how's Mother's day looking?
B	I haven't looked yet
A	when are your next days off?
B	Wednesday
A	next Wednesday and Sunday?
B	Sunday
A	when does your week go Monday to Sunday?
B	it it does now yeah
A	so you've had your days off for this week and so you next week you've got Wednesday and Sunday?
B	I don't know
A	ooh
B	so I might
C	but you do the rota though?
B	yeah I do the rota I haven't done these rotas the old manager did them I haven't even looked at doing a rota yet
A	well the old manager never worked by all accounts so there's no surprise she booked herself off for these
B	yeah
C	oh
B	mm
C	okay so so she
B	yeah had both off she's had this whole week off as well
C	but
B	she's had a week they've just given her a week's pay
C	to think
A	what?
B	for not yeah to have time to think
A	who told you that?
B	about what she wants to do
A	but you get
C	well for her yes but
A	well why not for everybody then?
C	well for
B	I'm new
C	a ladder a a a
B	be running
C	be successful otherwise
B	you wouldn't think so would you?
A	are you gonna contact
C	I I read it I read it
B	we were together when he had that
A	oh right so
A	what he'll do is forget to call you over the weekend and then Monday morning he'll go
A	where are you? are you getting the next flight up? so you'll have to make an effort to phone him
B	are you are you gonna go
B	dad are you gonna go
A	as long as he's paying you I don't care what he thinks
C	mm
B	mm
C	well he he did employ somebody
A	we haven't got any man
C	but according to
C	they thought it was just ticking off pipes
A	yeah
C	and erm apparently there's some
B	they didn't want to do it
C	and then this other bloke didn't wanna do it so
A	the other bloke just wanted well normally it's just
C	something
A	all it is is writing pipe numbers down
C	mm
C	ah
B	ah
A	so they wanted it cleaned out
B	oh
A	that's the point it was a bit
A	what what they do is they have to flush it through with a a high pressure water anyway before they start using the pipeline so
B	oh
A	it seems a bit pointless to scrub every pipe
B	to put it underground
A	they're they're just I think they're just being stalling for money that's all and they're usual tactics anything they can do to stall payment
C	mm
A	that's where you go wrong
B	but why why are you
C	I don't I don't know I don't he said in
A	just
C	all he's described it as a as a er a fair degree of manual labour
B	ten-hour days?
C	I'm sure a ten-hour day for
B	oh okay so he just the one day ten hours that's what he wants you to do?
C	that's what he's saying isn't it?
A	it won't be ten-hour days because for a start it's too dark to offload at the moment after
C	mm hm
A	up to two hours
B	mm
A	four pipes on a wagon to look at
C	so
A	if we haven't got
C	his ten hours is probably
A	and it won't be ten hours if we haven't got anybody
A	when when if you haven't got anybody on-site then erm they'll just claim that they never had the pipe or they didn't have those numbers or
B	mm
A	it's it's just to get
A	that's what it's for
C	fine
A	there's a you need four-wheel drives for the
B	three days a week for how many weeks?
A	well they've got two shipments this is the first shipment they've got another container load of pipes coming in
B	how do you know
A	so
B	this mum
A	er
A	Christmas meals
B	wow
A	there's a lot of pipes
B	mm
A	so that's why I know they're doing two shipments
C	well he hasn't he hasn't really
A	he won't give you details you'll have to learn on the job but that's all you need to do is write down pipe numbers and and just make a note of everything that you think they might complain on
C	photograph the numbers
A	don't send it to
C	fair enough
A	as long as you cover your tracks like that then er
C	it's something different isn't it?
A	well yeah just take a few take your thermals you'll be needing it more than
B	it'll be cold
C	mm hm
A	is it just you for tea tomorrow? normal time
B	I don't know I guess I'm seeing
A	so do you want tea or not?

C	oh right
A	so they didn't capture her and they haven't got her then?
B	no
A	was this when it all happened on Tuesday?
B	yeah so she did it on Tuesday day then when I left on Tuesday night about quarter to six three people came in and no sorry one person came in and stole three rings
A	off the stand? how did they do
B	so that day we lost four rings
A	do they do they cut them off? how do they do it because they're attached? how do they?
B	have you seen them? have you pulled one ring up before?
A	well yeah only to put it on my finger as you would
B	yeah yeah
A	and it's attached
B	yeah it's attached but all it's got to do dad could yank it off if he wanted
A	oh you've just got to pull it hard?
B	yeah
C	you need to have someone stronger
B	you literally just have to like
B	push your like finger like around because it comes up about this much
A	yeah
B	so people can try it on with different rings
A	yeah yeah
B	and stuff and you've just got to pull it like that and
A	I wouldn't think
C	and yank it
A	you'd be yanking it I
B	yeah exactly you wouldn't nobody would
A	no
B	unless you're a scumbag
B	which is what these people are that steal them
A	mm
B	oh she's selling them and then she's buying drugs isn't she?
A	oh
B	the old drug run
A	everybody what off erm what's his face?
C	yeah desperate times come desperate measures and they they'd do anything to get their money don't they?
A	you have a very cynical view of the world for a twenty-two year old
B	what does cynical mean?
C	she's probably right
A	what does cynical mean?
B	it is right it is definitely right she mum this woman is not doing anything else other than
A	mm
B	she's completely out of it she's off her face she can't even she doesn't even know where she is what she's doing
A	I don't I don't know having never been on drugs been high or met anybody like that
B	well that is you wanna work in retail for
B	a week and then meet a few people
A	maybe she's trying to feed her family maybe?
B	oh she hasn't got a family or to be fair she probably has and they're probably
A	on benefits as well
C	in care
B	in care that's the right word dad
A	you can't go around it?
B	no you've got to face it
A	you've got to go straight to it
B	and that's what she's doing
A	well she's probably moved onto another area by now
B	reached the next
B	she can't get very far she won't drive she won't pay for a bus
A	well she won't
B	you can't get into
A	well how does she get into
B	she probably walks doesn't she? she probably lives like on a street somewhere
A	mm
A	what I can't believe is there must be people stealing within shops in
B	she's stolen from our high street store and ours and now we had
A	how many security have you got in the
B	oh I could not tell you
C	to book an appointment
B	you have you have to go out and flag one down
A	oh
B	well you wouldn't walk out your store that makes you more
C	yeah you wait there a minute and I'll go and find
B	you follow me if you want to er beat me up outside that's not a problem I'm not
A	well
B	and then the panic alarm's in the office
A	well I you just think erm that end of the
B	mm you'd think so wouldn't you?
A	well I I do think so
B	I mean we do we do some on a Saturday
A	mm
C	there's a there's an
B	we're having security at Christmas though
A	what?
B	a security guy for our door
C	right yes
A	laid on by Pandora or TH Baker?
B	TH Baker
A	not by the
B	not by the
A	oh well that's
B	so we're gonna pay for somebody to be our security man
C	right
A	oh well that's good
B	I'll love that I will
C	a step in the right direction
A	absolutely
B	I'll be able to say anything I want to any of them
A	oh you could have oh you could have yeah
B	I
A	absolutely
B	but I would have loved to have done it
A	yeah I know but you it's not worth your safety
B	and it's mm
A	yeah but
B	does she think I am? oh I haven't got that ring well where has it gone then there's a gap?
A	she knows you're not stupid she knows you know she has it
B	but she's taken it
A	yes
B	and it's in her pocket well give it me back
A	but she would have hit you or thumped you or and then
B	and she tried
C	stop you
A	yeah but then you're in danger so what's the point for a hundred and sixty quid
B	a hundred and thirty
A	well what's it cost Pandora? a tenner
B	that's so true isn't it?
A	it's it's not worth it
B	and then when the owner comes in and laughs it made me feel much better because he's obviously not arsed about a hundred and thirty quid is he?
A	no and it and it happens I mean they've got you know they they've built that into their figures they've got theft in there there's a figure for that
B	yeah
A	they're they're
B	yeah
A	there's figures built in for that
B	yeah
A	they take account of it
C	they would be more concerned or more
B	mm
A	you could sue them
C	and then TH Baker would be in right trouble then
A	and then they yeah
B	would they if she had have hit me?
A	yeah because
B	what would happen?
C	oh yeah
A	well if you you could have sued the company
B	what?
C	for not providing adequate
A	for not providing the adequate cover at work and you could probably come away with thousands hundreds of thousands
C	so then more
A	depending on what damage they've done to you
C	they would
A	let her walk away
A	yeah
B	well that's that's me I don't want somebody to hit me
C	no of course not
A	that should be everybody's philosophy
C	yes yes you don't want to get involved in any of that
A	used to
C	take the money that's what we used to do in the bank
A	I was gonna say when your dad was at the bank
C	if you want some money
A	have it
C	here you are have it
B	how do these people get away with it?
C	it's only money
B	how do they? like you say they come to the bank and you just have to give it them
C	yeah but
B	how how
C	once when I was there
A	once?
B	once?
A	once in all those years? at
C	yeah
A	you had a you told me on a few occasions you'd you'd oh handing over money you'd say you have the same person turn up for the payroll and they and they'd be beaten up almost
C	people would er attack people as they left the branch for instance
A	and they'd come back in all beaten up and
C	yeah that's what they had yeah
B	yeah?
A	that happened a few times that's what
C	yeah but not from the till
B	but that would
A	dad was on the tills

A	well you do otherwise it'll it's a shame because
B	twenty-five pounds
A	you know auntie
B	yeah but
A	erm
B	you see I need to just plan in when you're
A	mm
B	is she?
A	well the trouble is she doesn't
B	it's never on my day
A	no
B	and the thing is I don't want her to just come here for like a six pound
A	well she's coming to me next Tuesday just for that
B	is she?
A	oh I can't make what does that is that Monday? Tuesday? she's coming next Tuesday that's just for an eyebrow one two
B	mm hm
A	well I thought she was coming there
B	because I'm not really a regular customer am I?
A	well I
B	what time?
A	what?
B	you see again if she came in the morning I'd be able to go to work on the afternoon
A	well I don't know you can do Thursday is gonna be a late when I
B	I don't know
A	okay so there's there and then we've got
A	one
B	what dad?
A	then there's the fourteenth of April
B	at
A	you're never gonna get a day off on a Thursday
B	is that
A	she only works Thursdays and Tuesdays
B	oh she does
A	so
B	so I'll try and have a Thursday on the fifth of May
A	well she might not be able to fit you in
C	she only does two days
A	yeah she does she does a Sunday
B	does she?
A	she'll come out on a Sunday she says so if she's you know if you just want an eyebrow wax if she's around tonight in
B	yeah
A	but then you don't know if you're off on a Sunday then do you?
B	no it's a tricky one this is
A	well why did
B	no
A	well yes
A	if they're twenty
B	well yeah
A	twenty-five?
B	twenty-five quid
A	yeah
C	yeah it's
B	that's a very good idea
A	she didn't buy a particular thing she just bought cos I've still got a manicure mini manicure left on my voucher from
B	oh for
A	yeah
B	well make sure you write it down cos
A	yes
B	so you use the voucher
A	give you the money then can't I?
B	there we go all problems sorted
A	well it is really yeah yeah
B	so I don't have to try and book a date off
C	no
B	cos I don't really have the time to do that sort of stuff these days
B	no it isn't mum
A	no
B	not an option
A	ah it's busy being you I remember being busy
B	I wish I wasn't
A	fitting everything in
B	no I wouldn't
A	yes you would
B	I'm not
C	doing leggings aren't you?
A	have you bought your train pass yet?
B	nope
A	when are you gonna do that?
B	I don't know where to buy it from for a start
A	well I would say
B	I'd say
A	is that where you're gonna do it from?
B	because if I work a late or if I go in at ten o'clock there is no way I'm gonna be able to park there
A	okay
B	yeah but sometimes I do a ten till half six
A	well get it from
B	mm
A	which is a couple of stops can't you?
B	it's yeah it's only like it's I think it works out at five pounds something to get a pass
A	for
B	so yeah a day so I'd be saving what? a couple of quid a week
A	five pounds to get a pass or eight pounds not to get a pass a day
C	eight pounds a day that is
A	that's three pounds a day
B	three pound
C	it's almost half price that is
A	that's fifteen quid on a five-day week
B	oh yeah
A	that's sixty pounds a month
B	that's a good saving
A	of course it is
B	alright
B	mm
C	you should go online and find out how to get a pass
B	yeah you do I asked him
C	oh right
A	have you got any photographs from passports visas any recent?
B	yeah I should have a photograph somewhere
A	if you've got a recent one that saves you doing that as well doesn't it?
B	yeah
C	mm hm
A	go online sort yourself a
B	yeah
A	and you're saving money which can't be a bad thing
B	no it can't
A	okay
B	every penny counts
C	I used to
B	really?
C	yeah
A	I don't know that was always a bit of a thing peculiar to the bank I thought
C	I don't know
B	mm
C	I don't suppose there'd be and I don't know whether the
B	no London Midland
A	well it'll tell you on the website won't it?
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	what you can do I don't think TH Baker will pay you but er
