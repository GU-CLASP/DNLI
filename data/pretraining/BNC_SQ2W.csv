A	we have to like move out of this house
B	no
A	no no not move out of the house we have this viewing on this Saturday?
A	oh er are you here this weekend?
B	yeah
A	oh I am here it's just
B	oh
A	mm
B	is
A	er no I don't think so I think she's only here gonna be here on the Saturday
B	okay
A	that's annoying
B	we can change it if you want?
A	no it's fine it's just annoying just so soon
B	I know but that but she did say that if they can find someone then we can
A	oh I see that'd be better wouldn't it?
B	yeah unless we say
A	yeah before Christmas
A	okay
B	as long as it's basically as long as she's got someone to pay basically
A	yeah
B	she doesn't mind who who it is
A	yeah yeah yeah fair enough will they have they put the rent back up do you know? don't know? it's eight hundred not that it's much extra is it? but
B	I'd imagine she probably would
A	yeah
B	I don't think they'd had much interest last time did they?
A	no so
A	so she's got one viewing this weekend?
B	no there's like loads of people that wanna come and see it
A	good
B	neither did I because the woman that we that showed us round said that we were the only ones didn't she?
A	yeah
B	like she hadn't had anyone else
A	mm okay well
B	weird
A	yeah that's fine I think we'll just have to we'll just we'll have to make sure that they know that the
B	yeah yeah
A	so they'd have to get themselves
B	mm
A	yeah no if they wanted to move in earlier I guess then they could move in earlier couldn't they?
B	yeah
A	mm yeah
B	we could pay December's rent and then
A	yeah cos what I'm
B	well er er we'd probably move out before
A	yeah
B	mm
A	means I can find somewhere to
B	yeah I guess cos you'll be away anyway won't you?
A	yeah be away for two weeks so yeah that works fine
B	okay when she rings me back it's at ten till twelve on Saturday
A	okay
B	when she rings me back I can either say not then or I I guess actually
A	well no it's okay I think I've got a netball match at that time anyway so erm I won't be here can just make sure that everything's clean and tidy
B	yeah I didn't think it'd be so soon either but
A	but also that means no one's gonna be here we've got to be here to to show them round haven't we? yeah
A	okay
B	that's the downside of having an estate agent in
A	yeah
A	probably cheaper isn't it? probably cheaper to have like an external well not external but like estate agent that works just by phone and email
B	yeah yeah yeah true I suppose
A	rather than like having to come out all the time
B	mm
A	yeah no that's okay then yeah
B	well if I say to them
A	yeah that works gives me an extra erm four hundred or three hundred and seventy-five pounds
B	plus deposit we'll get back
A	plus deposit that can all go back into my savings
B	I don't know how that works is it the first?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah that means the next people are gonna get a fucking massive water bill which isn't theirs
A	yeah but my point is that if we don't pay it if we we've only paid one water bill from January through to June or July whenever and then if we don't get another water bill until like until if they don't get another bill until like January
A	that's gonna be our water bill isn't it?
B	unless we ring up the water
A	yeah
A	and I really really don't want that against my credit rating
B	I don't think I'm gonna be able to get that cancelled I think there's a
A	oh
B	mm
A	can't we ask them if they want to keep the internet contract?
B	I don't know how it would work though in terms of changing the names round and stuff
A	well we could just ring up and change the names couldn't we?
B	mm
A	which took us like a month
B	yeah
A	we could say that to them
B	true
A	yeah
B	yep
A	and then our we don't have to pay rent that last month which would be another four hundred quid
B	yep
A	then we wouldn't have to pay council tax that month
B	er
A	oh hundred and fifty quid
B	how er how often though?
A	every month
B	oh it is monthly?
A	if we paid it in November and then told them we were moving out in mid December they I think they reduce it or you don't have to
A	yeah
A	and then electricity bill we can ring up and er can you give us a final bill?
B	mm
A	what else have we got? gas same
B	mm
A	just ask them for a final bill
A	er
B	it does
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	we've only got two left
A	yeah so I've already yeah I've already
B	yeah so have I
A	yeah
B	out of the one I just got paid
A	yeah and then we've got so then in October
B	that'll go for November
A	so yeah er that'll go for
B	no
A	that'll be good
B	yeah
A	and my December salary
B	yeah
A	that's two salaries without having to pay rent
B	if it works like that
A	if it works like that
B	let's not get our hopes up
A	still I'll be like ha ha ha that's
B	I I wouldn't I couldn't I I don't see why it wouldn't work like that if if we explain to them that if you can come to an arrangement with somebody who wants to move in that we'll move out by the sixteenth of December the fifteenth of December
B	what's the weekend of that
A	but I guess it's probably it'll depend on whether somebody would want to move in half way through a month just before Christmas doesn't it?
B	mm
A	yeah that doesn't bother me I don't mind driving to work for like I could easily like ask
B	cos the sixteenth is a Wednesday
A	yeah
B	just pay a month's rent on the
A	well if we ask them on Saturday when they would like to
B	yeah we could
A	imminent
B	well I mean
A	no that's good
A	cos there's no point paying if we can there's no point paying for two weeks when we're not even gonna be living in the house so
A	mm that'd work yeah
A	really?
B	nicest one I've met when I spoke to them
A	that's good
B	yes
A	well erm
A	oh okay
A	she's just shit
A	she's actually the shittiest shittiest shittiest estate agent in the entire western world
B	I still don't understand why these companies as well like they ring you up and they're like okay so when do you want me to come? it's like
A	so any weekday
B	exactly I don't understand like er fair enough you have the same working hours as everyone else but you haven't
A	mm yeah
B	and I was like okay so morning then and she was like okay morning is between eight till one I'm like what the hell? do you expect me to factor that into my day?
A	yeah cos if you come at one o'clock you've just wasted my entire morning
B	for god's sake
A	they're just shit
A	they're really bad like I hate the the internet though we can come in the evening but you have to pay more it's like
A	so you're gonna charge me to come at the most convenient time of day
B	well that's just to complete the ploy though isn't it?
A	oh yeah of course it is
B	cos they know that everyone's gonna bloody well want to go in the evening
A	cos er yeah
B	it's an extra fifteen quid
A	exactly it's just oh er yeah no okay we'll do some cleaning
B	yep
A	it looks tatty it does look tatty like the paintwork really should be redone
B	the paintwork's shit
A	and we've also got to get the single bed out of erm thingy bobby's
A	hope it hasn't gone mouldy or anything
B	ah
A	what? is there a spider?
B	yeah
A	I've got a
B	it's like one of those horrible outdoor spiders
A	er let's have a look
B	er
A	it's actually the most disgusting thing I've like
A	I know
B	oh
A	I just hate spiders so much
B	how was your weekend?
A	oh it was really good so
B	how was the theatre?
A	well
B	oh yeah
A	we took her to
B	oh yeah I remember
A	so I turned up at her house at half about
A	so she like quickly got ready and everything and then she didn't know what we were doing and she was like why are we going into a car park? I was like
A	and so took her to the restaurant and she really liked that and she was so happy she was like I can't believe you did this it's such a good surprise
B	ah
A	blah blah blah blah blah and we paid for like her dinner and stuff cos it was only like eleven quid so it's not breaking the bank balance and then I stayed over on Friday night and she was like oh I can't believe you surprised me last night you're so sneaky and I went into her room at nine o'clock in the morning I was like er by the way you've got an hour to get up cos then we're going to the train station she was like
A	what the fuck?
A	so we took her to
B	who were you with?
A	just me and
B	mm
A	and
A	I was like damn it
A	but no then we took her to the theatre and she was like she was so happy she absolutely loved it with
B	what did you see again?
A	The Book of Mormon
B	oh yeah
A	oh it was amazing
A	like I don't know if you'd like it it was like quite politically incorrect and dodgy in that respect like it's er
B	uhu
A	but it was really good really funny
A	erm you could because it's written by the people who created South Park you can er while you're watching it you can imagine a South Park episode it's really it's really weird but it was really well done and the theatre like our seats weren't bad they were quite they were near the back but they weren't bad or any or anything and then we just came back here went to a pub and watched the rugby and then
B	nice
A	yeah
B	busy
A	it was erm like a weird feeling on Saturday we erm we were just going and then
B	why?
A	yeah I was like why? and she was like I dunno
B	then she must've known as well
A	and er so she knew and didn't
A	but I was just like why does it matter? then for some reason I was a bit sad
B	yeah
A	and then like er awkwardly enough she was there at the rugby
B	oh
A	and I was just like and like apparently they've been seeing each other for a while and I'm just like why why suddenly do I
B	mm
A	erm for some reason I felt a bit weird about it I don't know why it's not that I even liked him that's the weird thing he's a bit of a weirdo but
B	always weird I suppose isn't it?
A	yeah the person that you were seeing starts seeing somebody else
B	yeah doesn't necessarily mean that you like them but I suppose it's just a bit like oh
A	yeah
B	mm
A	just puts you in a bit of a weird mood
B	mm
A	cos it's not like I didn't really want him well I didn't want to be with him I
B	someone else wants him
A	yeah
A	it's like ah
B	was I missing something?
A	yeah was I did I miss
A	is it me? I bet it's me
A	like it's not it wasn't me and like I feel fine now but
A	yeah yeah oh definitely yeah like I
B	no
A	no no I didn't then I realised then because I was kind of embarrassed about it
B	it's not very nice that I hate that feeling
A	I know
B	that that's when you know it's not right
A	mm I was like
A	I just I
B	no
A	I would never take him to like a barbecue with our friends like
B	no
A	it would have just been
B	that's sort of what I felt about when I was dating
A	and I just feel horrible er you don't mean to be rude but I was just like
B	I
A	yeah
A	and I don't know why like
B	no there's no reason
A	he was a nice guy just a bit weird
B	just weird
A	and just a bit like camp and just a bit like just not me and I was just like yeah
A	I'm so confused
B	well that's good at least he's over it
A	yeah like I
B	oh god
A	why are you calling me darling? firstly you're northern and no one in the north says darling like they say darling but they don't say darling
B	and she was actually saying darling?
A	yeah like darling like
A	and she was like touching my arm and stuff I was like who the fuck are you?
B	oh god
A	why are you?
B	she's trying way too hard
A	yeah I was like who are you even? like and she kept like being like talking to me about rugby I'm like why are you even talking to me? I don't know you and I know that you know who I am because you're sleeping with the person I was sleeping with
A	so
B	yeah
A	erm you know I hope you have a good time and stuff and then I
A	I kind of like slipped in
B	oh god
A	like someone said like
A	and I was like okay so
A	and I did it as a joke but I was like
A	if he doesn't think they're serious
A	he definitely knows that she thinks they're serious
B	did he reply?
A	no
A	but I didn't no but I left it like
B	no questions
A	looking for a reply it was like I hope you're okay I know this and then it was like if we bump into each other you know if we don't bump
B	is he going back there forever?
A	yeah yeah
A	he's moving back to
B	statement of fact
A	let's leave it there shall we?
A	so so I just didn't mention it and then like I went back to
B	oh
A	and I feel weird too I was like that's okay we can feel weird together
B	poor
A	I know she was like I don't understand why I'm feeling weird about the fact that he's added this girl who he's been dating on Facebook
B	you want to be that girl
A	yeah or you now know that like they're more than just
A	they're like they're now like
B	actual Facebook friends
A	yeah that's so stupid though isn't it? like
A	being Facebook friends means something
B	that is er that's that is the next step though I think
A	yeah it is yeah like I don't have people if I'm dating somebody I don't have them on Facebook for ages
B	no
A	unless they
B	ah
B	exactly he'll miss you
A	and your brother's gonna be here
B	has she gone now?
A	no she's going tomorrow so I'm popping round tonight just to say goodbye give her a birthday card and I've got to take some of her clothes back
A	erm
B	when's her actual birthday?
A	next
B	mm
A	erm
B	well she'll've had her birthday with the bake off
A	yeah with birthday cake but no
B	can't happen

A	like
B	he'll miss all the little things that she does
A	exactly it'll be like
B	he might not know it yet maybe
A	maybe he just
B	ruin their friendship yeah true
A	I don't know but
B	it's so hard
A	yeah relationships are too hard and such effort
B	massive effort
A	talking about relationships and so much effort how was
B	such an effort
A	such an effort
B	no it was really lovely
A	yeah
B	just wandered round
A	mm did you go into
B	no
A	oh did you book those tickets for the Month of the Dead thing
B	no
B	I don't know if I'm gonna be able to afford it
A	ah
B	I hate money so damn much
A	I know it's shit isn't it?
B	it's
A	like even the odd ten pounds here ten pounds there adds up doesn't it?
B	yeah
A	mm
B	which is a hundred and eighty pounds which isn't that bad
A	yeah
A	yeah if I suddenly had a hundred and eighty pounds coming out of my wages I'd be fucked
B	and I'm trying to not that I'm making excuses but I'm trying to before I start saving I'm trying to cancel out all the debts I have
A	mm
B	so I'm trying to put
A	what debts do you have?
B	just
A	mm
B	that I haven't paid off yet because it's interest free so
A	yeah
B	what's the rush?
A	I've got I've got a
B	mm that and I've got
A	how much did you spend in New Look?
B	not much like it's only a hundred quid like
B	not not a lot
A	yeah
B	the the credit limit's only the credit limit is only a hundred and fifty pound
A	mm
B	but I've just been paying off like ten pounds a month so it's just taken like
A	yeah
B	fifty thousand million years to
A	yeah that's what I'm gonna do with my Nationwide like once I've paid off my John Lewis credit card
A	that's the one I use like every month to put like flights on and stuff
B	mm
A	like I don't want to put flights and stuff on a on on a
B	yeah
A	and then when I had to pay for my car and for my bed I put that on a fifteen month credit card and I have like I think it's got something like six hundred pounds left to pay off but once my I've paid off my flights for Lapland and stuff I'll just pay off the
B	yeah yeah
B	yeah
A	you can just pay it off can't you?
B	exactly it's just yeah
A	oh credit cards are ridiculously easy to put money onto
B	crazy
A	I'm really really trying this month to not put anything on my John Lewis credit card
B	yeah
A	it's just like little things like thirty pounds of petrol oh I'll put that on my credit card
B	exactly
A	yeah shit
B	jesus
A	I remember once I bought something and I didn't know that the my month cut off was the fifth I thought it was the thirty-first
B	oops
A	or the thirtieth so I put like a hundred and fifty pounds onto my credit card
A	and realised that I had to pay it off the next month instead of the month after I was fuck my life
B	oops
A	I had a credit card card bill of like four hundred quid I was like
A	I was not a happy bunny that month
B	it's worth it
A	yeah exactly
B	mm
A	it's
A	no idea
B	no me neither
A	that sounds like
B	I know well
B	so I need to sort of make an effort with his friends really and
A	oh my god that sounds like the shittiest thing I've ever heard in my life
B	but I'm doing it so it's fine
A	I hate girls
B	me too
A	girls actually just make me wanna like stab my own face
B	me too
A	well obviously not you and like girls I like but most girls if someone genuinely threw me into a room with a bunch of girls I'd like oh
A	like why are they doing this to me? they're just so
B	I mean
A	oh okay
B	so
B	I think I like her

B	because her dad helped her
A	oh I hate
B	she already wasn't
