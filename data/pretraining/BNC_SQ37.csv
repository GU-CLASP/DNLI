A	erm two recordings at the moment I've on my phone this is not very handy my phone because the technology of a smart phone
B	yes
A	is not particularly compatible with the
B	what the equipment they use?
A	with the MP3 and the other
B	oh
A	sort of software that you have
B	yes
A	to record music and stuff like that because erm they're you know they're all Apple people
B	yes
A	those people they like Apple better
B	oh
A	they don't like all the
B	oh
A	Microsofts and the
B	yes
A	but erm so the idea is just that we kind of chat away
B	yeah right fine no problem
A	so erm erm probably erm so erm you it's your your daughter that you went out to see when they she had her babies wasn't it? you were going out to see
B	yes
A	to see babies
B	yes
A	so
B	yes that's right yes she erm had her first baby er exactly
B	and I'm not having any kraut
A	uhu
B	erm well what's it called? er it was
A	oh I don't know actually
B	it was well it's
A	oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah erm
A	so I don't know how that works though because my my nephew was born in Bahrain and erm and I was never sure whether that meant that there was some kind of question mark over his I mean both his parents are British but
B	if
A	you know if you're born overseas I don't know where that leaves you whether there's the kind of there's just that little trace there in your heritage where people say
B	you you you you
A	oh you know
B	you'll have to be careful you will have to make sure that the er er British authorities know when it happened
A	mm
B	and so you have to tell the local consul
A	right
B	and so on unless they've changed it or unless the the rules in the European Union may be different but it was essential that er
A	oh right
B	so that they could
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	well I was yes I was slightly concerned with my sister as I thought you know actually erm you do find that people who are born and spend their early lives with their peripatetic parents sometimes don't develop roots
A	you know
B	my second son
A	mm
B	and that's where
A	oh really?
B	yes
A	mm
B	erm
A	I wouldn't have thought it was easier now I would have thought it was more difficult now because there are so many
A	I mean and we are actually getting worse
B	yes
A	about even Europeans coming here aren't we?
B	yes yes
A	don't know where all that's going to end I mean I know my mother when she first came to the country had to go to the police station every week and register
B	where where had she come from?
A	well she's French
B	oh she's French is she?
A	mm
B	from which part of France?
A	well she was born in Toulouse
B	oh right down there?
A	yeah
B	at one part
A	uhu
B	in in in
A	yeah
B	and they they put a lot of money into all the educational facilities and he got an internship with
A	mm
B	and from
A	uhu
B	erm and he went to a London university but it was quite a business and while he was at the London university the I had to deal with the business of his citizenship
A	mm
B	but only when he was I dunno he must have been er seventeen or eighteen yeah
A	mm
A	whereas the French I was talking to my mother about this the other day you know I could get a French passport if I wanted one and erm and my siblings have done so erm but they all reported how snotty the people were at the
B	oh that's that's true
A	so her
B	mm mm
A	and they were all sort of very disdainful and looked down their nose at you
B	yeah yeah
A	and like
B	mm mm
A	can I help you? what are you doing here?
B	mm mm mm
A	so I've always sort of put off the business of going to to get a French passport as well but there were various times when erm
A	well I
A	er because erm obviously he felt that it would help his cause I suppose
B	yeah
A	rather than his opponents'
B	yeah
A	so but I think they seem to have a very different attitude to to us have you got property in France?
B	no no no no I'm glad erm I wouldn't want to have either
A	no
B	I I wouldn't want to live in France it's a nightmare country
A	do you think so?
B	it's er oh gosh it's awful
B	you know no er I mean the only sensible thing that any French people do is come over over here why do you think there are so many people French over here?
A	well I don't know I mean
B	well the
A	mm
B	or you go into a big firm like erm er Thomson-CSF which is the biggest armaments
A	uhu
B	erm and unless you have them you can't get a job
A	no
B	erm and then if you want to set up your own because you can see all the the er on-cost of the bureaucracy which these large firms are stuck with the minute you set up a company you have to pay tax whether you've made a profit or not it stifles all initiative it's quite extraordinary
A	yeah
B	and I'll tell you another thing if you have and this is from past experience if you have a house or a share in a house and you want to share that house you have to do it through a a er an agent appointed appointed not chosen by you appointed by the state
A	mm
B	and he acts as a a erm a mediator and whoever is buying the you know er property has to use that person as well
A	gosh
B	and so if you erm say well you you think the man is getting it all wrong er firing the guy is well a very expensive job in in fact
A	mm
B	it it their system of doing things is is weird
A	they do have very
B	mm
A	very strong protectionism my mother
B	oh yes that's
A	my mother inherited her mother's house and
B	mm
A	erm
A	she was obviously very
B	mm
A	so it wasn't it just wasn't feasible as a holiday house and er so she let it out and you're not allowed to evict any tenants between November and April because you're not allowed to evict tenants during the winter because of the potential hardship of the tenant
B	oh
A	so even if they're not paying you rent you're not allowed to evict them
B	that is barmy
A	erm it all went so horribly horribly wrong over the years that and she got fleeced terribly by this this one man erm who really sort of took liberties and then when she came to sell it she had that same situation where you have the
B	uhu
A	the person who brokers the sale
B	yes
A	and the only saving grace of it is that in order to avoid death duties and capital gains and stuff like they're they the the appointed agent will at some point or another leave the room whereupon packages of money are exchanged under the table
A	between the
B	mm
A	which is sort of set a price where you know which is quite an innocuous sort of price
B	yes
A	that doesn't attract any attention from the authorities
A	and then there's the real sales price
B	mm mm
A	which is negotiated privately on the side
B	mm
A	so you know you have pieces of paper on the table
A	that says the house is being sold for X and then an envelope with
B	yes
A	the balance of the money gets passed underneath the table while the guy is is is looking in the other direction erm so erm so the French have found a way around the bureaucracy
A	in fact I think really but but that's not to say that erm the state is not a bit erm oppressive in that
B	yeah
A	about property ownership
B	yeah it's true
A	there
B	all and er all the land and I know that that but
A	mm
B	it doesn't belong to various individuals
A	mm
B	my aunt had a house er in er erm er
A	mm
B	and so on and you have to oil everybody's hands and
A	yeah
B	otherwise you just never get anywhere er
A	no
B	oh
A	and you were okay and also you know he felt that erm oh he had a thing about David Blunkett introducing all these laws about gun owning guns and things like that
B	mm
A	so
A	he just
B	mm
A	seeking to be very parental about about how they live their lives and what they have and what they do and
A	and so on but I don't I think the French are catching up with us in that regard actually
B	their inheritance laws are are bizarre
A	mm
B	erm
A	no
B	I think is ridiculous
A	no cos you can't it things get inherited by your children don't they not by your spouse?
B	er that's correct and and also you can't erm er just er er write a will saying I leave all my property to a cats' home
A	no
B	or I leave all my property to my second son
A	yeah
B	not my first son and it doesn't matter if you put in the fact that you
A	yeah
B	your
A	so it's a feudal then really isn't it? or sort of
B	well it's dictatorial and it's a totalitarian is sort of
A	yeah
B	er however you wanna call it
A	yeah
B	er
A	but I suppose it's about you know perhaps it's about land perhaps it's about you know the family farm going down through the generations or something
B	mm I think er er er er I think it's a erm an intellectual approach I would say rather crudely that all French people suffer from the
A	oh yeah?
B	er if you they all quote Rousseau at you
A	uhu
B	erm about every man is free and all that sort of nonsense and erm
A	mm
B	and so on they don't stop to think about the practicalities of it and the result of that is that they're for example their er farming agricultural industry is chronically inefficient
A	mm
B	because none of the units are the right size
A	uhu
B	er they don't once you build up a a or you reach a what I think you call a critical mass on the farm for example you get the right amount of machinery and get it
A	mm
B	but it once you get to the right level of saying five hundred acres or might probably be a thousand acres in fact erm er then when you die they will say oh no that's all got to be split up again and so they they're constantly destroying the
A	mm
B	it's weird
A	that is very weird isn't it?
B	it is yeah
A	gosh I suppose they've got a lot of land though haven't they? perhaps er perhaps they're not they haven't got the same sort of the the panic about it that we do cos we're always sort of saying oh we're running out we're running out of land there's not enough room whereas France is very spread out and sometimes actually
B	it is yes
A	you look at the way the French sort of set things out and you think
B	oh that's that's
A	with your countryside
B	it's funny that you say that because erm French people coming over here erm we've er taken erm er
A	mm
B	er er which I find weird actually because when you drive around er the suburbs of Paris where there are gardens or in Normandy where there are good farms they look after them
A	yeah
B	beautifully
A	yeah
B	because they have this sense of style
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	erm
A	well even in the middle where there's very little and very few people
B	yes
A	when you drive across it's all
B	yes
A	it's all you know you it's not like being in America where you've got the Badlands or wild quite wild country
B	yeah
A	that's not obvious that it belongs to anybody it's all terribly cultivated
A	how strange
B	I'm sure you read about the guy who was not allowed to run a ski school
A	no
A	uhu
B	and as a result of that he got the opportunity to ski right through I think two or three winters and got himself qualified as a ski instructor
A	uhu
B	but they
A	because?
B	because has hasn't gone through the rigmarole of taking all these exams
A	oh
B	and erm this that and the other and so on
A	mm
B	it's just childish really
A	well I don't know I I often think the French are fifty percent of them are bureaucrats and the other half are anarchists
B	yes that's just about true yes
A	and they kind of hold each other in a state of
B	yeah yeah
A	my mother's definitely on er on the anarchic side actually
A	she's she went to some you know if you have the misfortune to go into a courtroom with her or something and you stand up when the judge comes in my mother's sitting there starting to go I don't see why I should have to stand up for him he's only a human being like the rest of us
B	er at one point erm I'm I I I had a heart attack and erm I thought while I while I was recovering I couldn't work I will erm er er brush up my German so I went to
A	uhu
B	and er in and er it it it's a I think it's a a college of further education or whatever they call it anyway
A	mm
B	er it's very the language language department is very well run the head of the language department is a French lady
A	mm
B	and her sister she introduced me to her sister her sister is the most joyous individual she is one of the anarchists
A	uhu
B	and you know erm in I think it was in Nicaragua
A	uhu
B	erm or one of those Central American erm countries they what do they call the
A	oh
B	contra something or other
A	yes yes yes yeah
B	mm anyway somehow she got herself into a position of editing the a book by one of these I wish I could remember what they're called erm they're
A	yeah
B	erm and er I got to know her quite well and she certainly had anarchist tendencies and on one occasion the book was being published in Paris and so
A	mm
B	she er was going backwards and forwards and er she was doing a job I think also I dunno if it was in
B	what on earth? you know oh she said there was a
A	uhu
B	erm about something or other which something had done I said what was it all about? it took me about two hours to discover that she really hadn't a clue what the demonstration was about
B	she joined in because it was a good party
B	literally literally
A	uhu
B	which was rather fun and it was all about smuggling things like bicycles
A	smuggling bicycles okay
B	yes
A	uhu
B	now into central America well I always thought central America was er you know straight up and down no
A	oh
B	the thought of bicycling around Nicaragua oh I wish I could remember what they were called
A	oh no I my brain has gone as well now
B	but but the the sort of villain of the piece was a man called Noriega I think
A	yeah
B	Confindustria er Confindustria for the Italian erm CPI not that
A	mm
B	anyway
A	mm
B	it was quite a interesting experience
A	mm
B	er but I've got to know quite a lot of French people and really quite well and
A	you seem to have a constant stream of French people actually
B	we do yes because they like coming over here
A	mm
B	they live in Primark getting our our
A	oh I know well the little girls we have at the
B	yes
A	all from this school in Bordeaux
B	yes
A	and we have a link with a school in Bordeaux because when I was growing up erm there was a young woman called
B	yeah
A	and er she had a student she then went on to be a student and and
A	this
B	oh right
A	before they write to us and say can I come over and do two months' placement with you so erm so we have this ongoing link with erm with the students in Bordeaux but they all come over here and erm they're very naive really about what to expect when they get to London and some of them have the most horrible adventures with
B	oh lord
A	rental properties and unscrupulous
B	oh lord yes
A	types and whatever
B	yeah
A	so and they're cos they're always trying to economise by finding you know finding flats on the internet and you can't tell them that London's a big place and it's full of strangers and that that actually you can't trust anybody you meet on the internet and there's one girl
B	yes yeah
A	in particular who got awfully stung and erm and er somebody took about two thousand euros off her in advance
B	oh dear
A	er rental on a flat and turned out to be
B	god
A	a complete fake and the flat didn't exist and
B	oh heavens
A	I know
A	so they do they do actually fall er get themselves into trouble from time to time
B	yeah I spent a day Bordeaux is a rather a nice place actually I think
A	oh I hate it
B	oh do you? oh I
A	yeah
B	had very happy times there er when I was working in
A	oh yeah
B	and er I was the the
A	they have a splendid cathedral
B	er Bordeaux erm and the reason I was sent to Bordeaux was because it was English for such a very long time and they were actually keen to find out the the clerk of the works and his erm people in
A	oh
B	the British colony in Bordeaux
A	yeah
B	and the er
A	oh gosh
B	I don't know if you've have you been to Chichester? the the the point
A	mm no
B	but it's it's as the cathedral is very interesting
B	and he er he managed to take photographs of it actually happening
A	oh my god
B	er and and they're really primitive pictures but you can see it's most interesting things because you can see that once the er
A	like a sodden pudding
B	yes
A	or something yeah
B	yes er
A	oh
B	yes really strange and the other thing that
A	I had no idea that had happened
B	erm the you can and well if you go there you will see the photographs
A	wow
B	at a tourist attraction
A	wow
B	and the other thing about er er Chichester is that there is still to this day erm they have a a a proper international stone yard er an awful lot of er churches in the south of England use quoin stone
A	oh do they? oh
B	yes uhu er and if for example Peterborough which is miles up er erm that's got
A	yeah no
B	a lot of French stone
A	yes absolutely I suppose
B	yes
A	it's quite near the eastern coast if
B	oh yes it was
B	it would go up the River Nene in a
A	yeah
B	in a barge
A	so perhaps it was that so you sort of went up that side of the country to get to
B	any rate I I went er with the direct er directed by the clerk of the works in Salisbury erm to the people in Chichester and then I was sent off to Bordeaux to see whether there was any
A	yeah
B	any link
A	and was there?
B	there is of craftsmen erm it's quite limited
A	uhu
B	erm there's no what I call
A	mm
B	no all of that came from
A	uhu
B	actually erm and to Canterbury and so on
A	oh right
B	erm
A	but craftsmen individual craftsmen were going
B	individual craftsmen who would go and do for example
A	mm
B	which are beautifully carved and and some there was an interchange between craftsmen from France coming through England
A	yeah
B	and vice versa
A	yeah
B	but erm otherwise no not
A	oh right yes
B	nobody er nobody knows quite who was the engineering brain behind Salisbury cathedral because it it it's it is an engineering feat
A	yeah
B	there
A	well then er they are just when you look at them and think about what the must have been involved in conceiving them and building them then I mean well it must have taken well it did take decades in some instances didn't it to put them up? there's that wonderful erm William Golding novel called The Spire
B	oh yes that's right that's right absolutely you know
A	and I think it's an absolutely fantastic book
B	mm
A	a man of a man obsessed really
B	mm
A	and he did a bit of digging around and found out a bit more about our architect and it was the only the only building he ever
B	yes
A	but he he only ever sort of led on one building which was our building
B	really?
A	but erm but you know he was erm he he got quite good press for it really in those days
B	mm
A	er but
B	but there was a street named after him
A	yes the one opposite
B	what was it called?
A	yeah
B	is it?
A	yeah
B	er yes
A	so
B	but I've never found a I've never heard of any come across any other building that's put up by him
A	no
B	I suppose that's right
A	no he was
B	er
A	there were some there were other churches he worked on as part of a team for a boss but
B	yeah oh
A	so so that's it that was fun that was quite fun to find that out actually so we we this this open day thing was quite good for us it was it was
B	I'd noticed you'd put some lovely erm prints or drawings up as you go in at the bottom of the lift
A	yeah yes
B	that's rather fascinating
A	yeah
B	or
A	no that's my little photographic expedition
A	all these photographs from the
B	yeah
A	there's quite a that quite an amazing of the spire of
B	oh yes yeah
A	before all the houses came so
B	yes yeah
A	so it's sort of standing on its own in the middle of an orchard or something
A	which is hard to imagine these days
B	do you still have an annual art exhibition?
A	we do
B	yeah
A	we do
B	great
A	so and actually
B	yes
A	now running classes on our building as well so so that's
B	oh that's good
A	kind of of that sort of class going on
B	yes
A	where people pay for it apparently erm
B	there'll be er er on the twenty-ninth there'll be a girl erm there called
A	uhu
B	I'll introduce you to her she works for
A	oh yeah?
B	erm
A	oh
B	and erm well you might find it quite a useful link I don't know
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	er because they've got a lot er er a large educational programme
A	yeah
A	I think you were trying you there was somebody before wasn't there?
B	yes there was yes there was
A	I mean years ago and didn't come off for some reason
B	mm
A	I can't remember what that was the
B	oh I think the reason it came
A	oh
B	erm erm and I had to postpone meetings I've I've I've er do remember that actually
A	mm
B	and
A	I think there might
B	I certainly arranged for somebody from the
A	yes
B	that I know that that did come off erm
A	oh I think but I think it might have been one of those things where there was one conversation and then one person said that I need to pass you on to another person and then as so often happens
B	yes
A	that's where it never quite
B	oh it
A	actually kind of comes about
B	yes yes
A	despite good intentions on both sides and I I think
B	yeah
A	the timing the timing cos of the timing of the art competition or something it didn't work out I can't remember but erm
B	well yeah mm
A	but as the open day was a way of marketing
B	mm
A	cos that I think you know it has limited I don't know how we've we market ourselves I think the best way is to have people in the hall and saying you know oh what a lovely hall I think I might come back here
B	oh dear
A	well we were having an argument er there was the most surreal argument at the AGM about the bollards
B	outside the west end?
A	yes
B	mm
A	because there were there was a few instants where the people who run the nightclub opposite were just taking over the car park at night and there were a couple of er attacks stabbings
B	oh lord
A	where the perpetrators were loitering in our car park and jumping out on people in
B	oh
A	stabbing them
B	dear
A	and then jumping in the car and rushing off and there was also lots of drug dealing so we decided that that we were going to lock the bollards so we had a rather surreal conversation where we had a delegation from the church demanding that they be allowed to have a bollard please so given that we were reporting on the fact that our finances were up the creek at the time
B	mm
A	and then they turned up and said yeah but yeah but can please can we have a bollard please?
A	so as usual a completely disproportionate response to er
A	so anyway so you've begun to when you retired you were going to sort of help the the the association round here but did you did your estate here get taken over in the end by an
A	uhu
B	and erm
A	I presume this was enough to
A	or did they knock it down
B	no no
A	they didn't knock it down deliberately?
B	no no no it was it was it was
A	thank goodness for that
A	mm
B	erm and I er er they erm er selected the they interviewed and
A	uhu
B	and er er we were responsible for er putting together a package er which covered all the functions which er had been discharged by the council
A	right
B	to service their tenants on this estate and that was er the the terms the legislation which provides for the transfer away from the council to a recognised housing
A	mm
B	association and that has to be voted on
A	yeah
B	and there was a
A	oh
B	erm but yours
A	gosh
B	yours truly being I was rather surprised from talking to people because I thought it would be passed on a nod almost
A	yeah
B	I discovered that that the ballot had been rigged
B	and that people had been going round erm er er er er saying er
A	oh right yeah
B	at the far far end knocking on the doors and say oh give us your erm er er voting er card and we'll put it in the ballot ballot box and erm
A	oh no
B	they'd they'd either been telling people how to vote or they'd just not been putting the er papers in the ballot box
A	oh no
B	and the the the truth of it was that the electoral that the ballot was carried out by the I think it's called the electoral reform society
A	it is yeah that's our
B	and they had been so slovenly er they they should
A	had they really? they should
B	oh yes
A	they're supposed to be the people who are the example of how to do this
B	they were not they were just lazy
A	really?
B	idle and so we erm
A	uhu
B	erm and er with
A	mm
B	ministry of housing erm
B	they said yes and erm the second time round the offer made by erm metropolitan
A	mm
B	was accepted
A	oh right okay
B	and then erm the offer was based on metropolitan spending twenty-four million pounds
A	yeah
B	on the regeneration of the estate
A	mm
B	erm and er er the the board the shadow board was er er given permanent er status so to speak and er it it had to allow for a a rotation in membership
A	mm
B	and I er volunteered to stand down erm after the first I think it was two years erm and er
A	mm
B	the sort of urgent repairs that needed doing and then I stood down but just before I stood down er they came up they discovered there was er asbestos all over the place
A	oh no
B	yeah and erm
A	oh
B	and said you've got to take all this asbestos out and it was blue or brown or pink or I don't know what what it was and er
A	the harmful kind
A	oh no
B	erm and er er we were told that we if we had this could have it done for free
A	yeah
B	erm and I said well that's fine but I
A	mm
B	and the
A	yeah
B	er of the houses er which had got asbestos in them and so we
B	one way or another I just got and we all got completely fed up
A	oh
B	with
A	oh how
B	er I think it it was very unsatisfactory the whole thing and er they'd been erm I'm out of it now but I I just got completely browned off
A	no I'm not surprised really
B	er er it was really tiresome
A	not surprised and I think some of these
B	yes
A	got out of their depth
B	yes
A	with all this stuff
B	well they've got very weak management
A	mm
B	and they don't pay attention to details they they
B	and so we had had to you know er er we get
A	no
B	and er er and in one of the houses
B	two two or three down that way erm fortunately er the the freeholder erm er noticed the work was being done when she was not aware it was about to be done and she she'd found that the guy who was doing the work had muddled up the numbers
B	and he was doing work which should have been for
A	oh
B	number eighty-four
A	yes
B	on number eighty-three and number eighty-four you know when you come up the street and the houses
A	yes
B	on that side are completely different?
A	yes
B	there's a small dock which belonged to the council
A	yeah
B	that's number eighty-four and they're
A	oh
B	early Victorian houses and he
B	should have been doing a job on that on the house over there
A	yes
B	and he was doing trying to do that sort of just didn't work at all
A	no
B	er
A	I remember once getting a free boiler service like that
B	mm
A	when somebody was supposed to be at somebody else's house but it's not very satisfactory is it really? that's bizarre isn't it? so erm have you lived here since it was new?
B	since what?
A	since this this was new this house?
B	no no the the houses were built in nineteen sixty-seven
A	uhu
B	and er erm they were privatised by wait a minute
A	mm
A	oh right
B	yeah and this house was erm the tenant was a builder erm and he made various changes erm including disconnecting the house from the communal heating
A	oh
B	erm which in fact was a erm a a really sensible thing to do
A	uhu
A	oh right
B	where you and I are now and there there was a a curious pipe connection sticking up into the middle of the kitchen it was really very very odd indeed
A	oh
B	but the
A	oh oh really?
B	and where that is the case the erm the houses are built in pairs in fact
A	mm
B	and underneath that wall and not under this this wall but under the next wall erm there was a a er like a er a solid wall
A	uhu
B	so that no water can pass through one to the other
A	oh right
B	and
A	okay
B	erm just pipes and that's all and then the the wall here is is it isn't any longer but it was relatively it had a big hole in it in fact
A	mm mm
B	erm and there is a tunnel which you can er go through er which was built originally erm as a er er like a a test
B	where there were other pipes and so on
A	yeah
B	but when they when
A	oh the
B	and if if there's if there's a very high tide
A	yeah
B	the water backs up
A	yeah
B	and the the erm
B	the the these er chambers cos they're they're not really like cellars you can't get into them
A	no
A	right gosh
B	erm
B	which infuriated
A	yeah
B	erm who who erm were not getting any
B	er it's quite extraordinary and er
B	they they let us know that they were going to disconnect the communal aerial there's a communal erm er a television aerial on the top of
A	oh yeah yeah
B	erm and er
B	whether we were connected to it or not I don't really know but anyway they'd cut through some wires when they were disconnected that
A	yeah
B	and cut through our television
A	oh
B	aerial wire
A	no
B	so we we sort of oh enough is a enough and we bought a a a saucer
A	yeah
B	and a lot of other people have similar bought saucers
A	yeah
B	but that's where
A	no that's every exasperating isn't it?
B	yes
A	very exasperating I mean are they they must be they sounds as if they're more exasperating than
B	well by quite honestly they are actually because at least
A	yes
B	and they also erm er
A	oh yeah
B	so and the
A	yeah
B	you know
A	that makes sense to do it
B	and they
A	in advance doesn't it? rather than
B	yes it does
A	wait till they've
A	especially with these modern builds where they've got
B	yeah
A	voids and passages and things
B	yeah they
A	through the brickwork that you
B	yeah
A	they pop up everywhere but
B	yeah
A	have no idea
A	oh no that's
B	yeah
A	that's sad really oh dear
B	then erm there were er two councillors that were er on the
A	mm
A	mm
B	and I I said I just wrote back and said no way er
A	oh right
B	and said oh why I didn't know he was going to I it was it was the most
A	oh
B	you know er standing as a Labour councillor hadn't a clue what the Labour
A	oh right
B	their policies were
A	mm oh well
B	anyway there you go
A	oh
B	mm
A	I see
B	I've got up to I've got up to sixteen forty-eight
A	right and how many how many
A	how much more have you got to go?
B	er I'm erm er er er it goes up to nineteen eighteen
A	right
B	and I actually have read up up to nineteen eighteen
A	mm
B	and it's just a question of sorting myself out and sitting down and and putting something down on paper but
A	yeah
B	it takes quite a long time to do that and it I did too lame and too lazy to go what you have to do is to go every day to the British Library and
A	and
B	er because to make a a book worth reading you have to contribute some sort of original view on subjects
A	mm
B	and erm
A	oh
B	about the lead up to nineteen fourteen
A	mm
B	and why it happened
A	mm
B	erm and I was looking at a lot of those books and they are erm very interesting
A	okay
B	very interesting indeed erm
A	mm
B	I think
A	you were right about general anaesthetics and things though I think you do get knocked sideways don't you by these things that come along and you think you can bounce back and young people think they can bounce back perhaps they can when they're younger but it's just takes longer
B	I think they can when they're younger yes I just found that after three hours in in the British Library if you you stop for a sandwich at lunchtime and you go back and sit down at two o'clock half past two I'm
A	yeah
A	I know
B	but
A	that's very sad isn't it?
B	well
A	I've never been there actually I meant to join and er
B	oh it
A	I believe I could join but
B	it's it I think it's superb actually
A	uhu
B	I think it's very good I I don't know what the er the the it's in two parts erm there are some nineteen seventy-five onwards
A	mm
B	and
A	uhu
B	because the stuff that I've been looking at was published in the nineteenth century or
A	uhu
B	erm and it's very well equipped and the atmosphere is very you know you you you're not disturbed
A	no
B	that's the beauty of the place is that it's quiet and er
A	studious atmosphere
B	a studious atmosphere
A	yeah
B	yeah and there's plenty of room and the staff are extremely helpful
A	mm
B	they're very helpful indeed
A	oh that's good
B	I was amazed in fact because erm
A	uhu
B	in a place called Salamanca and erm to my horror when I got there I found nobody but nobody could speak English
A	ah
B	and I also
A	you need to go away from the coast in Spain
B	er
B	erm other than the catalogue which had been written by some er well I suppose amateur in eighteen nineteen or eighteen twenty
A	oh
B	and but all
A	really?
B	all the papers sort of period from fourteen seventy-seven to seventeen fifteen they're all located in this one place which actually makes it very easy
A	mm
B	from the point of view of you know what you're looking for is there
A	yeah
B	and and all the
B	earlier documents I'd I'd not come across this before are not
A	oh wow
B	erm and you ask for a I the the lady who was sort of erm I don't know if she was appointed to look after them or somehow she she took to looking after me erm she couldn't speak English but she knew that Philip the second had been married to bloody Mary
A	uhu
B	which was what I was interested in
A	mm
B	and after talking to her
B	using a dictionary mainly cos er there's no electronics there's no you can't there's
A	yeah
B	but you can't use it for research at all because there's nothing is is
A	how extraordinary
B	and erm anyway
A	it has revolutionised things since this stuff
B	oh absolutely
A	when you put it online
B	absolutely this good lady erm she's she eventually
A	mm
B	erm from a visit of er of Philip the second to
A	oh
B	this country and it was er riveting erm it was one of these things that had been rolled up as if you
A	yeah
B	quite a long thing
A	yeah
B	and it listed literally every member of the staff
A	yeah
B	and all their clothes
B	and all their food allowance
A	oh really?
B	I'd never seen anything like it
A	oh how exciting
B	it's a masterpiece of bureaucracy
A	oh
B	incredible
A	wow
A	and that was the sort of was that the the big initial meeting between them when they were sort of circling each other and deciding whether they were going to have a a political union and a
B	it well well
B	yes I mean there were a lot of correspondences there before she got married
A	mm
B	and then there is his visit here
A	mm
B	and that was a thing which was I wanted to really to see what er I could find out
A	mm
B	but without having a really working knowledge of of Spanish and ancient Spanish Castilian erm I find it very very difficult indeed
A	wow yeah
B	er so I have to rely on other people's erm
A	yeah
B	er
A	yes
B	there is a lot of primary work easily available
A	yes
B	and fortunately erm
A	but you've got er
B	it's the
A	to go through it
B	yeah absolutely right
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	it is amazing now with with Kew what you can get online and we were stumped in our with our family history there was one insuperable obstacle that we couldn't get past and then all of a sudden one day it just popped up online
A	you know and then it's just simple
B	yeah
A	it's straightforward all these other things fall immediately into place but you know until that point it was the sort of date we didn't know whether two individuals had got divorced and if so when it when it might be or where it might have taken place or whatever and so we
B	yeah
A	and then and then erm just when you know
A	that saved so much time it would have been otherwise would have been days and days and days and days and days at Kew going through
A	uhu
A	uhu
B	and erm I had
A	are they related to the
B	well it's spelt
A	oh right well obviously
B	it's
A	oh yeah no no no difference by then yes
B	an Italian name
A	yeah oh right
B	she's not Italian at all but erm any rate erm I er met her when I went to
A	uhu
B	she's er by training a erm a violinist and she's also the national UK national expert on Schoenberg does that mean anything to you? Schoenberg?
A	vaguely I've heard of the name but I don't know er
B	he was a
A	oh really? oh right okay yes
B	yeah anyway erm I made friends with her ages ago when she was a student and so on and I always kept in touch with her
A	uhu
B	and the there's a marvellous court library with the Hofbibliothek it's er in the building itself is fantastic and what's in it is equally fantastic
A	mm
B	and I er a lot of it is the national library and is open like the British Library is you just go in and say there's my British Library ticket which they accept and you just ask for what you want
A	uhu
B	but there's part of it where all the very special erm delicate and erm er prized works are are
A	yeah
B	kept and they're all kept in
A	mm
B	er designed by a man called Fischer von Erlach I don't know if you've heard of his but the leading block architecture er architect and er erm it was closed
A	uhu
B	and er well and I I suddenly saw that
B	I went over to her and I said hello
B	she said I'm making a programme
B	and I said really? she said why are you here? and I said well I wanted to go and look into some papers in the
B	I I think I can sort that one out cos that's where we're making a programme you can become a member of the BBC staff for the day
A	oh how wonderful
B	and so
A	how wonderful
B	I got into this and and one of the things they were actually looking at er er concerts which were put on between nineteen hundred and nineteen fourteen
A	mm
B	and what was done to promote Schoenberg it
A	mm
B	it was quite a an esoteric exercise
A	uhu
B	but it coincided with and it er I think it's the year nineteen nineteen seven I
A	mm
B	and appalling floods
A	mm
B	in the Danube Basin and erm the people at the
B	academic stuff and this person came over and said what are
A	mm
B	which were taken of the the emperor going and visiting the villages which had been flooded
A	oh
B	and I mean it was absolutely fascinating
A	how amazing
B	erm they were quite informal and the other thing that this man said he said er this is the time when the Austrians decided that they needed to have a navy a proper navy they all
A	uhu
B	that they ought to have a Dreadnought
B	and it there is a er a special exhibition on at the what they call the the
A	mm
B	he said go there and you will see something which is really unique so I went and you had to book in and at eleven o'clock on er
B	Friday morning and so on and
A	oh yeah
B	two big reels on the top
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	and and you could hear it whirring away
B	and what they'd got was the newsreel of the launch of er
A	mm
B	the ship was constructed and up to er a hull the complete hull and first decking
A	mm
B	erm in a dry dock and it was held in place by these enormous erm I suppose they were
A	mm
B	erm they are sort of the the the cross section of the hull
A	yeah
B	there are these timber props
A	yeah
B	and to launch this ship they opened the the er lock gate at the bottom
A	mm
B	to the let water in
A	mm
B	and they told the guys to knock the these great
A	yeah
B	so that the ship would slide out into the into the into into the sea
A	yeah
B	what they didn't realise was that when the ship went into the er into the water it would cause an enormous displacement of water
B	into the dock
A	oh no
B	and there were these poor people who were drowned
B	and it was all on the film
A	oh no
B	yeah it was
A	oh my lord
B	er quite extraordinary and horrifying
A	oh my word
B	and there was this stand you could see everything because it showed Franz Ferdinand and
A	oh my word
B	horrifying
A	oh my word
B	yeah
A	that's shocking isn't it?
B	yeah
A	oh
B	anyway
A	yeah
B	I've been been to the Ukraine
B	and the problem is the problem
A	yeah gosh
B	and
A	gosh well no it was always a hugely wide ranging piece of work
B	yeah so I dunno I hope I'll finish it
A	I don't know
B	I should but
A	have you thought about doing different volumes and?
B	er I I've I showed the first half of the first part I've written to a publisher and
A	well well quite
B	and
A	I mean I find that there's
B	if if if
A	nothing wrong with textbooks I mean what is the historian to do without a textbook? and he
B	well exactly yes we have to start somewhere
A	yeah
B	then you build up on it yeah
A	and things that aren't textbooks someone can be very suspect
B	yes exactly yes
A	things written by journalists who
B	yes
A	knew nothing about it last year
B	yes
A	and now are experts
B	yes
A	all these er my pet hates when you have people like Simon Schama or Andrew Marr who
B	Andrew Marr is a mm
A	no
B	he is not a historian
A	but they sort of stride about and they say
B	yes
A	within fifty years the whole of Europe was Catholic
B	yeah
A	and you think
B	er
A	er
B	yes yes that's right
A	I'm not that they were
B	that's right yes
A	or you know
B	no
A	don't think so no not really
A	and he might know a lot but how can you follow what he's talking about?
A	it doesn't make sense
A	or it makes sense in a spurious sort of way but but erm well there we are let me just see where we've got up to
B	yeah
A	in terms of timing oh look we've done an hour and a minute
B	gosh that should be enough for
A	yeah let's do that
A	stop
A	oh there we are
B	oh good
