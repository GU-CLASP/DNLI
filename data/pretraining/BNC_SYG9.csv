A	sorry
B	think we were talking about uh to get
A	sorry I was just I was saying about
B	to get we were talking a little bit about politics weren't we? Oh in
A	I was talking about immigration
B	the uh the ID scans um
A	I dunno what it's like in
B	that's a  that's a  hell of statement In Europe there's not really a problem is there?
A	no
B	um
A	Cos before you used to be able to travel with just a photo ID
B	Europe is a  is a  coast guard you know uh border
A	yeah
B	with their own cultures and languages and people and there's loads of
A	but
B	it's really near to the Middle East it's near to Africa
A	yeah
B	it's near to Russia the the the the there's all potentially dangerous sources of uh illegal immigrants or terrorism or blah blah you know
A	but I'm sure you used to be able to travel just with your
B	and so it's a real nightmare like
A	if you're an EU citizen I'm sure you could travel just with like photo ID like with your driving licence
B	uh
A	yeah
B	and my parents were were you know kind enough to drive me to Berlin from England so we had to go
A	yeah
B	we had to go in the Channel Tunnel you know through uh France but into Holland and presumably into Belgium as well on the way to Holland
A	yeah
B	stopped in Utrecht
A	yeah
B	stayed in Utrecht and then
A	yeah
B	uh because Poland's in the EU now
A	yeah
B	and Poland and Germany history are slightly resisting of each other
A	well yeah
B	yeah
A	when we travelled on the night
B	yeah
A	D'you remember that when they took our passports for like fifty minutes and I was like I hope they bring them back
B	yeah I mean there's there's cos I remember some friends of mine when I was in Berlin some friends of mine travelled down it's not that far to Prague
A	yeah
B	they the trip the return trip or something got totally um
B	totally screwed cos they they were delayed and
A	yeah
B	uh I mean and this post like this isn't the  this isn't the  Cold War any more this was like two thousands you know the noughties
A	yeah I remember when I went
B	it I tell you why it's because they were Greek nationals
B	and I remember when I was in uh going to Szczecin from Berlin with
A	yeah
B	so they assumed that we were going home
A	yeah
B	to to Britain via
A	yeah yeah
B	from Poland to
A	on a jolly
B	they they were like
A	yeah
B	where where are they going? Why are they going there?
A	yeah
B	they like
A	yeah yeah
B	and it's certainly much worse out of the EU
A	yeah
B	uh in terms of
A	I know when I was in
B	yeah I um
A	so they said like just stay stay quiet like just say like you know
B	yeah
B	and uh
B	yeah I think that
A	yeah
B	he was travelling to to pick me up on the return uh from Paris to take me back home to England for Christmas and um
A	yeah
A	but I don't
B	he's just got that sort of look
A	well
B	you can
A	I think
B	uh I think we we it's one of them things where you gotta wait for better technology to come
A	yeah
B	that that that that little weird that uh bee machine that I saw like
A	the what? Oh the sniffing bees
B	the bee machine
A	yeah
B	the the bee machine
A	ooh sorry
B	uh in a box that looks like a little hand held vacuum
A	but I've
B	the
A	I know
B	in uh  in a  in a vacuum cleaner type
A	it is crackers
B	in the little compartments
A	yeah
B	these bees sat in the
A	yeah
B	just imagine a bee that with its head popping out the top
A	it is weird isn't it?
B	uh so anyway yeah
A	but I think
B	uh better technology will allow to do better checking with minimal uh discomfort to the uh
A	yeah
B	to the driver
A	I saw the  I saw the  thing
B	yeah yeah
A	I saw a thing with um you know like watching all those like border patrols and um
B	just just waiting room vision
A	waiting room telly
B	like
A	but
B	oh right to detect if it's full of illegal immigrants?
A	they've got like a probe and they put it in and if there's any like if there's carbon dioxide in there then they're like oh and then they have to get get all the baked beans off the lorry and then find all the
A	immigrants or whatever
B	well um
A	yeah
B	of the criminal to uh
A	well they were saying about um
B	so if you you were saying that carbon dioxide well they're gonna have to create a uh put an air conditioner in the  in the
A	well they do
B	well they could breathe into like a
A	yeah
B	like a pipe and that could be connected
A	try and
B	yeah
A	did you hear about the news about those um
B	oh yeah I saw uh like Barclays were doing it
A	it was on the news
B	yeah
A	yeah Africa yeah
B	yeah they mentioned Kenya actually
A	mm
B	and they're really essential for
A	they're now they are
B	um
A	ah
B	did it? Didn't have a guy called Cory in it?
A	zack was the main character
B	was that? It's not Cory or something?
A	zack
B	is that that little like kid with curly black hair?
A	and then there was like Kelly Kapowsky
B	is it's a school drama right?
A	then
B	is it like a school? Is it like a little kid with dark curly hair?
A	mr Belding
B	what? Sorry?
A	screech
B	what are you talking about?
A	that's what he was called
B	the little kid with curly
A	kind of geek one
B	just uh like he looked like he'd be in like some Stephen Spielberg film or something
A	I don't know but yes
B	he's the
A	but then Mr Belding
B	yes
A	um she played like a sort of geeky girl and that went on to be in like Showgirls
B	what's that?
A	is it Showgirls? It's like a  like a  stripping stripper sort of film about strippers?
B	I dunno what that is
A	she got curly hair?
B	mm I don't really
A	aw we're talking cross purposes
B	oh right I don't I just don't know um
B	american
A	I suppose
B	Cos they don't wear uniforms over there do they?
A	no
B	kind of like the uniform cos I so I was always so badly dressed
A	this is
B	yeah
A	in Saved By The Bell like Zack had like a mobile phone
B	like a satellite phone?
A	like a massive brick with like a massive antenna
B	that that went on his back and had like a receiver that you just had to pick up from the
A	it was really big and he was like Hello like I remember sort of
B	yeah and and I know that they're really popular with um militias
A	with what?
B	militias
A	uh
A	okay
B	uh what would you call them?
A	ah right
B	like they use the mobiles to to like obviously coordinate themselves and
A	but like
B	uh they can be but but but not
A	yeah
B	yeah um
A	they they would
B	yeah the the the monitor will like
A	yeah
B	but it would depend on the  on the  politics of like
A	yeah
B	and you're living in Pakistan and uh you're making some texts sending a text
A	yeah
B	got got um
A	re plans
B	yeah like uh
A	well he didn't go anywhere
B	ay?
A	compound
B	had to burn rubbish again
B	um
A	my wives are busy making dinner
A	it's probably really distasteful making sort of Bin Laden text jokes
B	anyway yeah if you're Ben Bin Laden uh you're in Pakistan so Pakistani you know Pakistan Telecom
A	yeah
B	uh is uh it's got your uh your text
A	your details
B	obviously
A	your number
B	and if America then wants to scan Pakistani text messages because obviously there are a hell of a lot of uh
A	yeah
B	anti-American
A	feelings
B	militia in uh Pakistan
A	and elsewhere
B	America's then gonna have to try and buy that stuff off the telecom the perhaps and the government might say you can't have our stuff
A	yeah
B	Cos we're a sovereign nation
A	yeah
B	and then they'll say okay uh we've we've thought about it and uh
A	yeah
B	but yeah there was I mean I heard a debate um about ID cards and there was a lot of there was some quite powerful sounding arguments against ID cards and uh
A	I
B	yeah I mean that that's the pro argument isn't it the
A	like if they can roll all those together into something that be fine
B	yeah I mean no like
A	I think you'd probably still have to have your passport cos they need to stamp things on it don't they but?
B	I mean
A	can your driving licence not be it though?
B	you've gotta have a massive database but you've gotta be
A	because what information is on your driving licence like let me have a look because
B	I dunno
A	the you only really add to need to add a few more things don't you like what have we got? Name um date of birth place of birth address signature picture
B	your your picture which is uh notoriously uh dodgy because it only has one eye visible
A	I need to get me  I need to get me  name changed
B	yep it's it's it's not got your full title there
A	probably have to pay though don't you? I'm not gonna pay to get it
B	I think we have
A	when does it expire? It expires in twenty-fourteen
B	well yeah I mean
A	that's bad that
B	yeah so as we were saying I mean like
A	is that when I passed my test? When did?
B	you'd only  you'd ony  get your passport in um in Britain and France
A	but what I mean is
B	actually Britain
A	what I was saying before was that I think you can do it with just your driving licence cos it's got your picture of your face on
B	within the EU uh maybe you can
A	two thousand and
A	I think you can
B	you can get to Ireland
A	I don't know
B	I'm not sure
A	I know
B	I think that would be  that would be  tough but well maybe you probably
A	maybe I should change my title
B	yeah you can drive all the way to Germany but if if you wanted to go into uh Poland I'm pretty sure they'd they'd stop you there
A	Cos I've only changed my name on on some things
B	so I guess you'll just have to introduce your your new title like at some point and you'll have to
A	I need to  I need to
B	change all your  all your  details
A	it's not on my bank
B	yeah I think it makes a lot of sense to put thing together but the the problem I mean some of the arguments against uh ID cards get tremendously uh
A	and like your blood group like you should have your blood group on there maybe in case you have an accident or
B	yeah no no you see like what thing the ID is if it's implemented properly like you know using the eye scanner or a finger print scan right
A	yeah
B	um you'd have you would have a massive database but the the the trick of it is that only the relevant information is available to each person like
A	yeah
B	the the guy who wants your medical records like a doctor
A	yeah
B	he can't see your criminal records
A	yeah
B	similarly you know
A	yeah
B	the passport guy
A	how many fillings you've got
B	your your your medical records your dental records or whatever
A	yeah
B	uh and everybody'd
A	but they do
B	but they would have something very
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	they'd put all your fingers on on the screen
B	yeah I mean no I think it makes sense I mean
A	and the picture of your face and that
B	I think you you just have to embrace that sort of the idea that uh that you're gonna have to show who you are and your birthplace but I mean obviously
A	I don't think it's a big problem
B	there's a lot of
A	yeah
B	but obviously um you know with
A	yeah
B	you know you could appear to be uh present at the scene of a crime that there's some DNA but in reality you weren't and stuff like that and uh so um
A	I'm sure they must take those things into account
B	things like like drunken like a lot of police patrol looking for drunkenness don't they in the the town centres or whatever but uh
A	yeah
B	of course you you could do something when you were or when you were a teenager or something and like you obviously wouldn't want
A	everyone to always be on your record
B	uh you wouldn't wanna  you wouldn't wanna  criminal record you know
A	maybe that would be a deterrent though like not to do stuff
B	um
A	to know that it would follow you around for all your life
B	well yeah uh
A	yeah exposed yourself
B	bared your  bared your  bottom to people on the street
A	yeah
B	late at night when you were drunk or something do you then like does the state decide to prosecute for that but they they probably but cos it's a silly thing to prosecute someone for but that sort of incident
A	no
B	have some sort of
A	or like having wees up sides of
B	well that's a
A	I know but
B	things have got to come out somehow uh but
A	yeah
B	uh and then the the the uh portaloos is it the the?
A	where was it we saw where they have that?
B	the the Portaloos the you know
A	where was it we saw that had like?
B	um in Soho I think they have like the
A	popped up that's right yeah
B	pop pop up out of the ground
A	at night
B	yeah
A	when you need the loo? It's horrible isn't it? It's a horrible feeling
A	yeah it's not very nice
B	uh no like well yeah so so I think but it's it's a tough uh
A	I think  I think  the thing that put me off uh the plans that were introduced a while ago was that they were like oh and it's gonna be eighty pounds or whatever
B	for a? Eighty pounds for what? A new passport?
A	eighty quid to get a passport
B	yeah well I think if you did it
A	mm
