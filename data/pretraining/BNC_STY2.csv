B	can I ask you a personal question?
A	if it's about race no
B	no
A	yeah
A	mm
B	looking at me now do you find me attractive? do you find me attractive let's say when I when I send you
A	is that gonna be on record
B	well I'm not
B	I'm not gonna listen to these
B	what?
B	no no
A	that's cool I was gonna say
B	there has you're right
A	they've been deep
A	that's fucking that's that's
B	did you?
A	my biggest
A	not a bad
B	no not a bad
A	you are gonna get annoyed a bit
B	yeah I know fine
B	fine whatever
B	why is he wearing all green? like his socks are even green why?
A	why not?
B	what do you mean why not?
A	cos he wants to be the Incredible Hulk?
A	oh sorry Marvel nerd
B	I am a Marvel nerd so what?
B	I just don't get the attraction like did you used to go to football with you dad when you were younger?
A	yeah mm
B	did you used to do
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	you used to watch it with your dad?
A	I'm not gonna lie
B	so what is the attraction? like I can understand
A	right now not much
B	no I do believe that but it's so shit watching it
B	what?
A	right
B	please explain please explain
B	they're not a team they're not a team yeah
A	yeah they're not a team they're all running about everywhere yeah you wanna pick two or three players that are like that you wanna pick two or three players that just stay where they are all the time
B	like defenders
A	yeah but it's all so tactical so much goes into it you think they're all
B	I don't think they're stupid I just think the game is stupid I er I er
B	I understand that so much thought goes into any kind of skill and
A	it's a sport
B	no
A	what do you like watching?
B	I don't watch TV
A	mm
B	I like watching bands and music and that's it
A	yeah so when you watch a band yeah?
B	or movies
A	when you watch em live you think oh that's alright that's good that ain't it? you don't realise how much thought and effort has gone into everything
B	you do
B	I do personally
A	how much effort do you think I put into music yeah?
B	a lot so you write you practice you erm write the chords
A	yeah
B	is that what they're called?
A	yeah yeah but when I'm
B	yeah course you are I understand that
A	yeah but that's part of it the fact that
B	that's what no one notices
A	yeah
B	okay
A	all you see is the half an hour that I show you live I might you might enjoy it you might not but say you play crap like you don't like it you might think they're shit but the reason I've been shit that night is because I've had a bad night someone said like they don't like it they thought it was shit so I can't perform as well
B	yeah I know that I understand that
A	and that's what makes me that's what makes it a good thing to watch cos sometimes it can be brilliant and sometimes it can't be just like football
B	yeah
A	one player can be amazing best player you've ever seen and then one game he could have a terrible game because someone
B	then you make your opinion
A	yeah yeah
B	in that one game
A	there's er so much goes into it I respect it I don't I don't particularly love football more than
B	so you watch movies though right?
A	yeah
B	no me neither
A	I've seen a lot of films
B	I erm the other week I had a clear out cos obviously I had all my stuff from uni and I er I had all my stuff already at home and I had this chest this wide and this deep full of books that I was giving away to charity like not even
B	well you wouldn't enjoy it like all the good
B	do you like Mills and Boon?
A	I don't know
B	well it's it's like romance
A	yeah
B	you like that?
A	course I will yeah
B	really? have you read erm Fifty Shades of Grey?
A	I have I've only skimmed through it and it's not incredibly well written for me
B	that's Mills and Boon
A	is it?
B	I had like a hundred of those books
A	are they
B	but no I
A	yeah
B	for reading so like if I read erm The Hobbit or Harry Potter that would be a joy for me
B	you know what I mean?
A	you can skip pages cos you know what happens
B	yeah exactly
A	you know it word for word anyway
B	and you and when you go on holiday when you do what I do so like your friends
B	yeah
A	I know I know what kind of music I like but
B	yeah but do you wanna play hard music all the time?
B	if you only listen to hard music you listen to it all the time no you wanna listen to easy going stuff right? same with er books and that's why I have a crate as high and wide as this table
B	we'd be an awesome
B	I read four hundred and ten percent faster than the average person
A	really? do you skim? or do you take a lot in? cos I tend to miss
B	both
A	I can kind of
B	I skim and take a lot in
A	I
B	okay let's do a test there's actually a test there's a test online that sees how fast you read and how much you take in
A	to calculate your
A	reading test
B	this fucking Ipad seriously erm
A	I'll get
B	yeah
A	I wanna do it properly
B	okay start reading
A	well oh I don't know about the people
B	go on tick it whichever one you think is right
A	I'm just I'm just telling you I'll have a guess
B	you are drinking so
A	yeah yeah
B	maybe you should do it when you're not drunk?
A	mm
B	go on
A	I wasn't taking in enough then though like I think if I was maybe
B	you would
A	but I don't think I was reading it properly
B	though can I just point something out? I was reading so I read four hundred and ten percent faster
A	yeah
B	than
A	I've read I've read War and Peace and it only took me about fifteen hours but I didn't really understand it all so
B	so er the first five times I took this I was four hundred and ten percent of a book okay so I've had half a bottle half a bottle of wine
A	done it
B	so a hundred and fifty-five percent faster after a half bottle of wine so
B	yeah well that's the thing
A	it's a it's a it's a really interesting test as well though cos I reckon I could do a lot better than this but I don't think
B	yeah but you should do it when you've not had a drink
A	I think no I don't think I read quick as as quick as I thought I would anyway like
B	it's not how fast you read it's how fast you take things in
A	yeah
B	you see but this is
A	nah nah I cheated
B	the thing is that I don't like
B	exactly the thing that I don't like about this test is that it
B	I tell you what yeah but
B	faster than the national average I want you to try this erm this test on here and it's
A	mm
B	and this is
B	maybe I would yeah erm I've literally from January to June I've been to three lectures read none of the literature and three hours before the exam I did a bit of revision and one
A	a doing word
B	okay so go more in-depth than that
A	er
B	go more more in-depth than that
A	it's a word that describes the action like er performing an activity so say er I am
B	go go more in-depth than that
A	erm a descriptive version of a verb would be an adverb
B	do you know what a
B	there you go well the thing is when I went to university I thought English language was knowing the basics of a doing verb a noun is a name
A	yeah
B	blah blah blah it really fucking isn't so
A	how many I was gonna say how many different types are there?
B	erm let's have a look content oh no exercises okay so
A	really
A	he bought me a lovely gift however he does not have much money he bought me a lovely gift although he does not have much money and them two things both mean kind of different things er straight away er that's the interesting thing about the English language
B	let me just show you something else so that's the same app okay so erm IPA go
A	er a conjunction is when you make er another word that's not a doing word a doing word I think
B	wrong
B	let's click on this
A	no I
B	erm which one do you wanna do?
B	okay er
A	ah
B	oh we can't do some of them can we?
A	right
B	right I tell you what I'm just gonna fucking buy it cos I need it for my degree anyway
B	no I
A	you might regret it tomorrow
B	I ain't got no money in the bank anyway so
A	oh my fucking god
B	oh my gosh
A	why give us the app if you can't do anything with it?
B	no that's a paid thing
A	fuck me
B	go back to nouns er word patterns that's a free thing I think there you go
A	hey
B	so read that
B	read that
B	erm yeah unless you're doing it in a degree
A	I would probably do this as a degree as a degree
B	okay so
A	right
B	common and proper nouns a a proper noun is someone's name
A	got it
B	okay
A	I wanna say white but I don't think it is this is the descriptive though I don't know if it is
B	you missed one
A	oh roll yeah
A	oh oh I
B	fit
A	ah plug man gutted
B	imagine doing
A	oh there you we go then
B	there you go
A	er
B	this is an active test not a passive test
B	leave the five there
A	think their examples are descriptive
B	try it
B	no it's a noun it's a name for something
A	it means the act of doing something if you
A	but you're also you're also doing something but you have to have
B	that's not bad though
A	staff I thought I
B	I tell you what
A	I tell you what one more one more
B	one more
A	I'm gonna go with what I don't think it is
B	okay
A	yeah?
A	it's hard that though ain't it?
B	yeah but that's my whole degree
A	it's really interesting I could do that all day
B	like it's hard as fuck
A	that's really interesting though
B	so like
A	I I know where I'm going wrong er as soon as they tell me where I'm going wrong as soon as it says like that I go yeah you're right
B	so like so like here look
A	I don't know a lot of these I don't know what a
B	no
A	no? I don't know
B	so a preposition is
B	determining something
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	a preposition is you would think it were a question but it's not so like erm it's of erm
A	right yeah get it straight away
B	so it could be a conjunction
A	yeah
B	a determiner or preposition depending on the context
A	mm
B	so they all have the same vocabulary but depending on the context that's used
A	that's why you're cleverer than me
B	no no I'm clever in a different way so
B	look at the verbs
A	I know the auxiliary I know the auxiliary stuff I know er I know
A	I've learnt all this like two years ago and it's it's in the back of my head but I can't quite express what I mean that's why you're better than me cos you can really clearly define what you mean but when I wanted to express it
B	I'm better at that than er you are but you're better at it than me
B	no listen okay? if you could this is a quote
A	yeah
B	that's it
B	no but that's it
A	yeah yeah yeah but all I'm saying
B	if you judge a fish on its ability to climb a tree
B	but if I if I judge you on your ability to do what I do
A	I would much rather
B	erm no
A	you don't realise
B	no that is a lie I'm sorry
A	the only way I would say I'm cleverer than you is by I am able to recognise that you're cleverer than me
A	I am I am clever enough to realise that you are much cleverer than me
B	ah this is
A	I think
B	no I'm cleverer
B	no but let let's just say I sat a music test and you sat an English test
A	yeah but
B	you would fail and I would fail
A	yeah but you've got the disadvantage of never having done music I did English for a while
B	yeah but it's not your speciality
A	it's not but I did it for a while
B	yeah but you've not done it at degree level so you would never know
A	but I could still get the basics
B	yeah
A	I know what a noun is like that's
B	a name
B	yeah but the thing is like you're judging yourself on something that you've not studied in depth if I if I' judged you on your ability for English you judge me on my ability for music then we'd both be
A	no but I think I think I think I think English is a lot harder though like I've studied it for a while and I
B	yeah you find it hard but I find it easy
A	that's why you're cleverer
B	no but some people are just better at some things than others
B	I'll are you going
B	shut up no I'm not I'm clever in a different way
B	sorry
B	sorry I didn't do it on purpose
B	sorry
B	good job
unknown_female	I know
B	I'll be kicked out
A	erm
B	no but you're clever in a different that was
B	yours is looser
B	not like my
A	music's easy though music is easy
B	yeah but English is
A	no it's not
B	to me
A	it's not I've done it
B	no
B	no but can I just say something? it's hard for you because you don't have an English set mind it's like me saying to a mathematician oh maths is easy cos I study it I know what it's about it's like a mathematician saying to me English is hard but that's cos they don't study it they don't know it like I do you know what I mean?
A	I think you're I think you're cleverer than me and
B	no I disagree I'm not cleverer than anyone seriously
A	yes you are
B	I'm fucking not cleverer
A	I've met some stupid people and you are not stupid
B	I'm not stupid I have a lot of common sense but I am not cleverer than anyone I would never ever say that about myself ever
A	I think you definitely are I think
B	how?
A	well because all the fucking managers were fucking retards I could tell that straight away
B	yeah they are retards
A	and I could tell that most of the people there had no aspiration to
A	no I don't think it is because I think if you're if you're I put it there's nothing wrong with being stupid cos I've got a lot of stupid mates who are nice people yeah and I would take a nice stupid person over a clever dickhead any day
B	yeah and me too
A	I I would much rather hang around with stupid people that are really really nice people all day but erm there's a difference between erm
B	yeah
A	but that ain't gonna happen I don't think I think you've er you've gotta be kind of you've gotta settle for a bit like I don't think I'm ever gonna be
B	I don't think you should ever settle
A	I don't think I'm ever going to achieve what I want to achieve
B	I don't think you should ever settle I think and this is me being cheesy and cliché or whatever or maybe being too optimistic but I don't think you should ever settle ever if you really want something then why the fuck should you settle? you should settle for a little bit but then what's to stop you from going? er it sounds so cheesy but it's like if you got your degree and then you ended up in Mcdonald's
A	yeah
B	it was a stop gap job yeah? what if you are if you stay there the rest of your life what would you do? you'd be miserable
A	if I was happy if I was happy with it like some of em are
B	that's different though if you were happy it's different
A	I would much rather be the best at what I'm doing and be really really happy but it ain't gonna happen I ain't gonna be the best at what I'm doing I ain't gonna be
B	yeah but that's negative to think like that
A	I am a negative I'm very
B	I am but I've learnt that
A	some people say it's being realist yeah but I I just think I'm cynical anyway like
B	I am a realist I'm not optimistic at all but I just think that I should never settle for anything like if you really want something you should never settle you should always
A	I'm really really cold I'll tell you that
B	yeah I'm freezing
A	sat here
B	I don't think you should ever settle I think if you're if you've got if you're in a
A	it it it depends
B	it's different but
A	for a for a job I could yeah for a relationship I couldn't if I wasn't happy I wouldn't be in it but for a job I would I would if I was just ticking along and it was making me a wage I could do whatever I wanted in my spare time and have a
B	earn enough money
A	just I'd take
B	I'd never
A	I think eventually it'd be self-destructive I think it'd start
B	yeah
A	I think I'd be really sad if I was trying a lot harder than I thought
B	you never got what you wanted
A	yeah
B	that's why I hated Mcdonald's because I was so much better than a fucking staff
A	no no I know you are
B	I used to work at Mcdonald's before I worked there
A	people like me and you are man
B	me and you should not work there
A	it was just a job but for some people it's their career
B	it was it is I know but why? like it's so sad
A	but but you know why I like
B	progress
A	it offers them a chance to be
B	better
A	yeah it cos some people'll leave school with no qualifications at all go to Mcdonald's and be summat and have a wage otherwise they wouldn't be anything would they? so for that sort of thing I can appreciate what it is and for people like me and you we're never gonna fucking stay there for the rest of our lives
B	no
A	it's so cold
B	I know I'm freezing but I left school like and no one knows this about me you're the only person that knows this I left school with no GCSEs at all
A	don't matter
B	like I had no GCSEs not because I weren't smart enough to sit them but I were getting bullied that much that I stopped going to school
A	it it don't matter though does it? look at what you're doing now
B	no but the point is like the difference is between
A	look what you've done
B	like do you know what I mean?
A	a lot of people go through their entire lives doing nothing that you've already done
B	but that that's what makes it sad for these people these people who don't have any ambition I feel so sad for them
A	but if they're happy with it I don't begrudge them that at all if if I've got
B	no I don't but I feel bad for them it's like they don't have the intelligence to want more if that makes sense?
A	I
B	no but I still feel sorry for them
A	yeah but if I was happy working at Mcdonald's I would do it but I wasn't like you
B	yeah me too I would like my dream is to work erm three
A	I just
B	I just wanna be able to do what I want to do and have money in the bank that's it
A	and go on maybe having a holiday a
B	yeah exactly
A	go to America
B	maybe maybe
B	you've never been no listen you've never been abroad you've never done all this and then I sat down and thought about it and I thought you know what? she might not want the same things that I want
B	and her aspirations in life are different to mine so maybe me feeling sorry for her is not what she wants because she's happy how she is
A	is she?
B	I don't know
A	how old is she?
B	twenty
A	maybe maybe in a couple of years she'll realise that she might not want to do that like your but chances are when you've got a kid as well it changes your whole like
B	yeah
A	so that was all that she was ever gonna do she did it and she now she's happy for it
B	happy yeah
A	so
B	see my sister had a job she had a life she met a knobhead from a rebound got pregnant to him after they'd been together five years and then they've been together ever since and she isn't happy with him but she loves the child which you always will do
A	and that's worth it yeah
B	but like you know when you look at someone and you just think I never want that and you automatically feel sorry for them because of your own aspirations? that's what I look at her and think and when I found out she were pregnant I cried my eyes out I my heart broke because my parents had never taken us abroad they could never afford it and I just thought you've never been abroad you've never experienced a holiday with friends you've never been travelling you've never seen all these things and I just think to myself well maybe she didn't want that
A	mm
B	maybe I'm looking at her life how I would want mine and not how she wants it and it it makes me feel bad but I I I feel so devastated for her because like when I went to America she said to me she's like oh you're not gonna be back in time for
A	yeah yeah
B	like you're the only person that's gonna remember it even if you do remember it in twenty years time like it doesn't matter he won't remember it I'll see him after and I just and every time I speak to her she talks about decorating she decorated the living room or she's done this she's done that and I just think it's so fucking boring
A	yeah
B	but that's me that's
A	that that's her life though that's what
B	yeah
A	that's her passion so you've gotta respect it to a certain point like
B	I do respect it but I still feel bad
A	I couldn't do it myself and neither could you but
B	but that's what makes us special
B	you need to go inside as well? fucking freezing
B	why?
A	too fucked
B	do you want a drink?
B	me too
