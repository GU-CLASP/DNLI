A	just as long as we get there in time
B	that's why er I think we'll go the fast way
A	which way's
B	he's going the way he knows past
A	he said he said
B	no I think that's there as well
A	the main thing is just to relax because er
B	yeah
A	it
B	right
A	to get the those two amps up the stairs right?
B	ah right it's just like playing for mass?
A	it is really they do a tuning up and stuff like that
B	well the thing is they can easily wait it's not like you've got a registry office spot is it? it's less pressure
A	yeah
B	cos they are already married there's no registrar there
A	ah
B	there's no signing in of the register
A	oh I see right
B	they just went and did that on their own and this is their wedding celebration
A	so what's this then? they're just doing their vows?
B	this er they they they only went for a small official service to the registry office just before we met them they'd done it two weeks before that or something
A	right
B	so that they didn't wanna be bothered with all the official stuff at their wedding
A	okay
B	they
A	er so there there won't be a minister or a
B	no that might fall
A	yeah that's
B	I thought the rain would be worse
B	see how clear that is? I'd rather follow that than try a different route
A	the sat nav?
B	I'd rather follow the sat nav than try a different route even if the other route was gonna be shorter what would you rather do?
A	I
B	but you're a navigator
A	no I'm the guitarist
B	no you're the navigator as well
A	well do you want me to have a look on the atlas?
B	no cos we know the two routes it's just which one do we take? the easy one following the sat nav
A	if if you kept on going right? and disobeyed the sat nav
A	and went to
B	yeah yeah
A	the only thing is
B	it would take longer
A	yeah as I that's what I'm saying
B	yeah
A	because er often people who take as I have done in the past it doesn't end up being shorter does it?
B	no
A	just take shorter in miles but longer in time
B	yeah well that's what
A	yeah
B	evidently it flares up the further south you get
A	yeah
B	so
A	I mean I
B	oh at the end of the service? yeah
A	you know when they're signing the book or
B	no there's no book to sign
A	oh well whatever they do
B	I think they will want music even
A	yeah
A	we've got the music it's not a problem
B	they they've designed their own service so they must be creative
A	they are aren't they?
B	yes they're quite
A	I tell you I know what we'll do
B	have you brought the Thomas Hardy?
A	I've got all the poems and stuff yeah
B	have you got the Thomas Hardy though? cos he wants literature and he liked that
A	oh yeah
A	oh yeah I know what we'll do we'll tell them I'll just start inventing
B	oh yeah
A	the origins of these dances cos no one knows you know waulking songs?
B	yeah
A	W A U L K I N G
B	yeah
A	in Scotland they did them everywhere like
B	yeah
A	one of the main ones was when they dyed yarn and all of that in urine
B	oh yeah
A	to preserve it
B	yeah
A	so I'll say this is reciprocating the
B	yeah
A	yeah do you want some of this can before I have a go?
B	no thanks yeah
A	I mean they sounded
B	it's really good if you can do those poems cos it just lets me find the next dance get the
A	yeah
B	gives
A	oh yeah yeah yeah
B	physically demanding for him
A	I've got one by Pablo Neruda
B	oh good idea yeah
A	I've got one by er John Agard it's quite nice
B	what's that one?
A	it's er something like let your love be a river you know that kind of stuff
B	oh right
A	there was a Guardian thing where it had they asked modern poets to er write verses about
B	they've probably I bet there's one they've chosen at least from yours
A	no cos I avoided the search Google search for wedding
B	ah very clever
A	I went into another one just
B	very clever
A	I knew that would be a bit
B	having said that
A	there's a heron
B	having said that oh yeah
A	that was amazing wasn't it?
B	having said that I think they would quite like the ones they've chosen for the evening guests
A	do we know how many guests there are?
B	no they weren't sure at the time were they?
A	are we dealing in what? a hundred? or two hundred?
B	I
A	right yeah it's a lot isn't it?
B	yeah it is quite a lot
A	how many were at
B	er about that
A	hundred and fifty
B	about that yeah
A	right
B	but a lot of hers have just come to sit down haven't they?
A	do you want
B	no thanks I'm guessing they'll have
A	yeah
B	but for the very start it would be nice cos I think there'll be a lot of people for the first dance that's why I'm thinking if we get them into the middle for Circassian Circle we can even have a circle round a circle round a circle we could fit everybody in if they were careful when they go into the middle
A	what is that dance? is it quite simple?
B	that's the simplest
A	ah good idea to start with it then
B	yeah
A	I was thinking maybe why not get them in the circle to start off with?
B	oh right yeah cos
A	do you without telling them that er just gather round the couple you know
B	gather round
B	they might be anyway
A	cos do you remember the chimney sweep used to say?
B	yeah
A	he didn't you know you'll never walk alone with everyone in the middle
B	yeah I remember
A	yeah
B	they're not quite
A	say it again?
A	right
B	because we offered readings and she liked the aspect of it being
A	yeah
B	about the
A	which one?
B	the
A	er I don't know it's about
B	I thought it was keep right up here
A	so you put this you put this venue into that sat nav?
B	hang on
A	bear in the right lane I think you have to be
A	oh we're alright we're in the south yeah no that's alright yeah
B	oh
A	yeah
B	it's supposed to be brighter it's darker down here look at it
A	there's a copper don't be speeding
B	I'm not speeding I'm not even up to seventy
A	I'd love to do one of these events where people aren't panicking all the time
B	who's panicking?
A	well about getting there on time or about erm
B	yeah that's why the
A	we have indeed
B	that'll be fantastic
A	my only thing about the
B	this'll be a hard this'll be a hard floor as well do I get over in the other lane?
A	yeah you join it
B	I don't know what you mean
A	well you said a hard floor it might be there might be wooden floors but the ceiling's laced with
B	oh I see
A	ceilings'll be laced with asbestos
B	yeah
A	well
A	that's obviously why
B	no she thought we'd cave in
A	yeah
B	poor isn't it? I think it is brightening up though I thought it was getting darker but
A	yeah
B	it is brightening up a bit
A	yeah I wonder if I should write a poem for them
B	oh that would be nice
A	yeah
B	aren't they leaving the mill behind?
A	they are leaving the mill behind just
A	her dad leased it before
B	yeah
A	so this is probably a bit of a wrench isn't it? in that respect
B	yeah they obviously want to have one last celebration in it
A	I should've just taken the those poems
B	have you still got them?
A	they're quite sort of simple aren't they? really
B	well
A	d√©coupage
B	did you keep it?
A	no
B	oh that's alright then
A	no
B	I bet it's lovely
A	do they what kind of
B	yarns
A	is a yarn wool?
B	I think they've got threads and
A	yeah
B	keep keep looking for me
A	I am love is like the life of wool
B	oh that's nice
A	it's it begins in mystery how about that?
B	love begins in mystery
A	love is like the life of wool
B	yeah
A	it begins far away
A	in mystery
A	sheep
B	yeah cos they're they're erm they're just near the moors aren't they?
A	sheep startled on the moors leave a fibre of life on the brambles
B	the beginning was nice just tone it down a bit
A	love is like the life of wool it begins far away in mystery sheep
B	mist and mystery might be nice cos there was
A	well hold on sheep
A	sheep startled on the misty moors
B	ah
A	far away in mystery sheep startled on the misty moors
B	yeah
A	a startle of sheep on the misty moors leaves behind right
A	a startle of sheep
B	yeah?
A	leaves behind the dream of a garment
B	oh yes that's better much better you don't wanna be talking about embryos
A	leaves behind the dream of a garment erm
B	no you put it on the erm
A	ah a carder
B	is that what they call it?
A	yeah
B	you've got the right ideas
A	yeah that sort of thing
B	just get the ideas down for now
A	I'll do er I'll do it later when we're
B	well why don't you write some
A	well it's just gonna be the
B	the journey of the wool
A	yeah
B	so that's what I'm thinking so what do they do with the yarn on that erm?
A	they card it that's why you get wool carder bees
B	yes yes
A	carding then you preserve it in urine but we'll leave that bit out
B	leave that bit out
A	carding tenterhooks
B	yeah
A	isn't that when they stretch it? leaves you on
B	yeah stretching on tenterhooks
A	love can leave you on tenterhooks
B	ah
A	well
B	oh I told you it would drop off there
A	no er I moved it
B	oh
A	that's really loud yeah er tenterhooks I'll just do something really simple if I can get it down then it'll be a nice touch just to hand it to them
B	yeah journey in wool well after that the stretching can you remember the ladies in the
A	eh
B	weaving
A	weaving
B	yeah
A	in each in each garment
A	yeah that's the trouble isn't it?
B	we're going all the way to the M62
A	so
B	if you look at that it'll tell you
A	what
B	yeah
A	when are we gonna find out about Jeremy Corbyn?
B	eleven o'clock
A	oh god it's gonna be amazing isn't it?
A	and it's taking place
B	we're on the A1 now
A	right we should follow this one for two
B	for how long?
A	thirty-four point two miles into the journey
B	see if you were going to
A	that's the way
B	they're going that way but I think we'll carry on
A	can't we get
B	yeah that would be better
A	right so
B	if you if you if I know the next step of each bit it helps
A	yeah okay we keep right to the fork onto the M1
B	oh just go back a bit
A	following the sign
B	just go back a bit just I'm on the A1 now
A	yeah you should follow the A1M
B	to for how long?
A	three thirty-four point two miles
B	how long do you think I've been on it?
A	oh not long not that long
B	ten miles? twenty miles?
A	twenty miles
B	have I?
A	then then you follow the A1 then you keep right to the fork onto the M1 you follow the sign for M1
B	right that'll do for now and then
A	there will have been similar ones before to get you ready
A	do you remember? like there's two or three miles of them
B	yeah yeah
A	yeah is this
B	that's
A	then we're on that for ten miles
A	then you come off at junction forty-two for
B	yeah
A	er can you believe
B	yeah cos do you remember when we went to that Ikea? it was nearly in
A	I didn't go
B	you did just
A	so you could get to
B	yeah
A	but who would in their right mind go to
A	I like the picture of
B	pictures pictures of the road signs
A	the pictures
B	how's he got those?
A	I don't know
B	whatever that is RAC or AA
A	I don't know how much to go on about you know we usually say these are the dances that people living round here would've had? you could spin a story about
B	spin spinning's a good word spinning
A	about how the people probably left places like er
A	and with their dances and ended up in this mill like working with their children
B	oh yes I'm sure they did I'm sure they had dances in the mill yeah
A	I I just don't know what the politics of the mill
B	what's that got to do with
A	well if you're up if they're like rank Tories they don't wanna be reminded of er
B	no er you're just reminding me of the Thomas Hardy
A	oh right
B	the people who would've loved you know to celebrate it
A	you mean this was all that remained of the fresh air
A	gusting through their hair
B	to be honest I think they're just like er
A	yeah
B	crafts and yarns and stuff
A	yeah I mean they must be quite entrepreneurial to make it work cos it sounds
A	arts and crafts you know is a massive market isn't it?
B	yeah yeah
A	people like
B	does she?
A	yeah
B	that's not arts and crafts she just collects egg cups
A	it's similar
B	no it's not
A	it's it's the same sort of like
B	no
A	department in the store
B	no no no no not at all
A	yeah if you've got a bunny rabbit egg cup then you're playing on the same team as people who make like
B	no not at all
A	cottages out of wool don't you think?
B	no some are collectors and some create things from the raw materials
A	so remember we're looking for er
B	M1
A	the sign for M1 onto the M1 you follow the sign for M1
B	glad it
A	it is a bit yeah are we still not out of
A	is it? that says
A	I think you get loads of loads of reminders
A	yeah
A	what? at four o'clock?
B	really leisurely meal well anytime I would love to go to a
A	well they're supposed to be the best aren't they? obviously it's the capital
B	I remember
A	talking about him
B	have they?
A	they're not even in the Super League
A	what do you think
B	I would love
A	yeah
B	to get set up
A	twenty-four hour Greggs
B	and just chill
A	I think we can do that
B	well I've found some jobs that I can do and I think it's always good if you pack the cars the same way and do the same jobs
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	before you get into this business you have no idea how much of a pain it is
B	well that's er
A	with the equipment
B	yeah it's the roadie side isn't it?
A	yeah
B	the the the problem is
A	he likes driving I don't know
B	no he likes being part of it
A	well where is he today?
A	yeah
B	oh so we might be near our thirty mile thing
A	yeah I think so yeah not far off it
B	oh right are we switching the er thing off and putting the radio on at eleven or what?
A	yeah
A	that would be that would be lovely wouldn't it?
B	that would be fantastic that's why it'd be good to get half seven start is it half seven
A	yeah
B	and then quarter past eight till nine o'clock
A	yeah but
B	so that's just the usual
A	they probably won't wanna stay up all night themselves
B	they'll be tired
A	she said she's got some sort of basic system upstairs where they can put music through
B	yes just normal microphones upstairs
A	you you got the first one yeah? A1 follow the A1
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	follow the sign for M1
B	yes I'm in the right lane aren't I?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah yeah
B	why is that sat nav not talking to me?
A	I don't know
B	you keep your eye on that bit of paper there
A	she should be shouldn't she?
A	did we switch her off when we put the volume up?
B	no
A	it might pipe up in a minute or so
B	I thought she'd say continue on the blah blah blah
A	yeah you'd expect her to
B	I might need to get a little sat nav to put on my
A	yeah why don't you?
B	cos you can see the map as well can't you?
A	no idea
B	it's just er I always thought I'd wait till they were under fifty quid
A	I think they are yeah
B	I saw one for sixty-eight not paying that
A	aye
A	I'm gonna er
B	I don't really want one for my birthday because I'd rather have clothes
A	yeah
B	that I need for school
A	well let's hope the Marks and Sparks scenario plays out
B	that's what I was wondering if we knew that was definitely happening
A	can't rely on it
B	can't rely on it can you?
A	I think once we've started a precedent it'd be cruel
A	yeah er
B	she's gone to sleep
A	what should I do?
B	have er have a look
A	it says one point eight miles until you change
B	oh right well just keep your eye on it
A	don't know sat navs might be a bit of a mixed blessing
B	well he's been on the UK roads for decades hasn't he?
A	this one's silent
A	shall I try and get the volume back?
B	yeah you might as well but don't get the picture off cos at least you can look at it
A	no I don't know
B	do we look as if we're still alright?
A	yeah
B	oh
A	keep right
B	ah she just tells you literally just before
A	in half a mile well that's plenty of time isn't it?
B	that's alright yeah
A	couldn't you get like someone
A	couldn't I was just thinking it'd be great to have
B	what did she say?
A	keep right
B	oh well that that
A	that's it
B	yeah
A	right okay
B	still
A	yeah
A	nine minutes to junction forty-two that's the one we're coming off at
A	well it'll be signed
B	so I just follow
A	you follow the M1 this one for ten minutes until at junction forty-two you exit onto the M62 following signs for
B	right
A	then you're on that one for ten miles
B	right
A	I think it's the one everyone gets off at
B	yes I know but it's whether you go east or west I I go as you get to it it's which way do you go on it?
B	what?
B	yeah
A	who who is it?
B	when we got a taxi once he said who would you like? we got erm Basil Fawlty
B	that was funny
A	did you not get Elvis or anything like that?
B	well he was dead he couldn't do them could he?
A	no but there's a bloke in Memphis who sounds exactly like him
B	oh an impersonator?
A	well not an impersonator just by some chance he's got the same vocal chords and everything
B	oh well he should offer to do it put your pound in a jar
A	I think I have haven't I?
B	loads of people would buy that
A	god you're right
A	cos it was an internet thing people saying have you heard this guy?
B	well if even if he can't sing you've got him a job
B	is that speaking? or singing? or what?
A	speaking
B	what number was it? forty-two?
A	yeah
B	the junction?
A	yeah junction number forty-two
B	what number's this one?
A	forty-six
B	oh oh we'll take this
B	are we getting paid for petrol?
A	yeah
B	are we?
A	yeah
B	is the cheque payable to
A	cash I've asked for
B	he can earn loads can't he?
A	oh I've just heard it's been cancelled didn't happen
B	I bet the result comes on the radio soon
A	shall I er?
B	how much have we got to go?
A	erm the
B	oh right
B	do you know how old
A	forty-five
B	fifty
A	is she?
B	yeah
A	you would never of I would never of thought that
B	no I didn't realise
A	mind you poor
B	yeah
A	she's just
B	she's
A	worries about everything
B	she does
A	don't know
A	yeah it's awful isn't it?
B	horrible it's like
A	this is the
B	yeah
A	you hear you can hear this four or five miles away
B	oh you will
A	on a quiet day
B	here we are M62
A	yeah
A	you don't want
A	it's junction forty-two
B	is that right?
A	yeah
B	right so which way's east and which way's west?
B	west is over there so I'm gonna go
A	I don't know
B	no south west east
A	well I don't know where the magnetic north is from here
B	well we're heading south aren't we?
A	are we?
B	yeah yeah
A	right
B	oh he will
A	yeah
B	oh yeah er it's a slip road off that's alright
A	you've still got three point nine miles three point eight miles
B	that was number forty-five
A	yeah
B	next junction
A	what?
B	oh right I seem to remember her having her fortieth
A	no
A	yeah?
B	than can you remember when we came back from
A	but this is beginning to seem long as well
B	I remember that one seemed very long
A	this one's quicker just in terms of
B	yeah
A	speed and less stress is it?
B	it's easier to see
A	is it easier to drive it?
B	I think it is
A	I just could never drive you know thinking about it I just dunno how you do it
A	always
B	good
A	I'd just been thinking
A	well yeah that's the trouble it would be stressful
B	it is it is in bad weather I must admit
A	and there's the
B	it's what?
A	well they've got stuff in
A	yeah
A	junction forty-two exit onto the M62 following signs for
B	at least I'm in the right lane anyway
A	so when we come to that junction forty-two
B	it'll be like loads of cars meeting at this point
A	this is the one
B	yeah this is it
A	five hundred and fifty yards
B	which way did I say was west? that way?
A	I don't know
B	north south no that way I'm trying to guess which direction
A	no you won't be able to
A	we're joining another sewer outflow of traffic
B	this
A	yeah
B	coming from all over the place
B	it's where north south meets west east isn't it?
B	that says roadworks
A	it's not now
B	that said roadworks
A	yeah with a date
B	just keep your eye on the signs
A	oh god welcome to our work zone you don't want that sort of sign though do you?
B	no
A	right at what?
B	the fork she's she's very good telling me in advance
A	oh
B	see how she keeps telling me?
A	yeah
B	I am right at the fork
A	that's it
B	that's it that's all I was worried about getting on the wrong one
A	ten miles
B	ten miles
A	it's eleven thirty the Corbyn thing though isn't it? not eleven
B	I thought it was eleven
B	just try and let me concentrate
A	yeah
A	this reminds me of
B	ah
A	a huge tunnel yeah
A	absolutely beautiful
A	who would've thought it would place like that would exist
A	in
B	that won't be long
A	er then the signs you follow this time are for
B	oh
A	oh you should've
B	talk about
A	right
A	signs you follow this time
A	it's quite tricky
B	she'll that's why I want the
A	yeah yeah
A	that's right
B	mm?
B	oh put Corbyn on yeah
