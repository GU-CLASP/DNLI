B	she is there all the time
F	she is there all the time yeah
D	she's there all the time
B	I don't give her I actually don't give her anything any more I just
D	mm

C	and she's got competition
B	there's that er
F	yeah
D	there's so many of them
F	dunno
D	if they can
B	well they have there's a  there's a  lot of I don't  I don't  know if still there

D	mm
B	but you know the erm the church
F	people just going out at night

A	should do
C	I did actually
C	when I was at Cardiff I did I erm I did a whole really big piece on erm The Big Issue
B	well well it's interesting cos like you know the Big Issue is seen as um I guess a kind of success story when it comes to a project
F	mm
B	and they just want the money and I you know
F	well it can't be easy to get out of that situation once you're in it
B	no of course it can't
F	like it's not as it you're gonna sell enough magazines to find somewhere to live or something
A	mm
B	the whole idea behind it though was that you know you're part of a kind of a social project of business
C	I love the I I love the ethos behind it
B	yeah
C	I think it's been incredibly successful for what they've done and what they've achieved

B	mm
F	yeah
F	so we don't care about the structure
B	it's a sign
F	yeah exactly
D	it's got a Free Tibet sticker
F	I mean I was surprised they didn't put it in all the the the  about the the property you know
F	it's er obviously a good selling point
B	huh er
B	do you think he did sell it then today?
F	yeah I would think
B	this guy as well he worked for the British
F	yeah
B	he's made ten
A	mm mm
B	he made twelve
F	yeah it could have been anything couldn't it
C	but
A	moving to Salford's not gonna be as nice as living in Kingsley
B	he's from Manchester though so you know
A	oh in that case I probably wouldn't like him anyway
C	look when I think of  I think of  success stories I think of the Aspinall
F	easier decision
C	I think of Jonathan Aspinall's success
B	but those were the days though
D	yeah but then
B	that was like the lustre days
F	that's
D	does that the not just mean that you have to plough the two hundred into the new property price so you lose it anyway
B	but you  But you  don't get that amount of
D	but if you're thinking that these people are selling their houses
C	but quite
B	even my brother  Even my brother  he bought  he bought  a house
F	it depends on which area you're moving to cos some area didn't or weren't all that as um as expensive
C	for er
B	but they kind of
F	different advertising or
D	mm
B	there was a  There was a  big boom of literally you you could buy a house
C	yeah
F	they went up seven or eight
D	yeah
C	firstly sorry for a second
D	my logic is if you're selling a  if you're selling a  house and you make a fifty percent profit on it
C	yeah
B	you're still gonna
D	if you imagine that you're buying a new house to live in
C	but it's
D	which will be fifty percent more expensive
B	but you can
C	possibly or possibly less expensive
B	so my brother made
F	yeah
B	so in  So in  Leicester my brother made thirty grand on his house
D	mm
C	exactly
B	you know so he's got that
C	so so this guy right
D	but at the same point in time which
C	like like okay look at this Jonathan Aspinall
B	it was still when he was doing it it was still like he's I mean his house in London is still going up in price
C	but look at this  look at this
F	house prices in London are going up
B	yep
C	yeah but look at this Jonathan Aspinall situation
D	but did he wanna live in Hull?

F	like a
B	er from Tuesday I throw myself back in it

C	and I haven't got any snacks
D	Don't worry Indi Indi
C	and I'm really sorry it's like tins of Rajma and chickpeas and crap like that
B	you could put them together with some lemon ginger
C	I I know but then then it all came together in like half an hour
B	well I I think it's
C	I know
D	we are saved
C	I know
D	we're saved
C	I know you are but I know
D	we're saved by Sainsbury's Taste the Difference pizza
C	thank you
D	Don't worry
B	I I um was really hungry as well which was weird
C	I just wanna say sorry
B	so I like I ate quite a lot in the  in the  afternoon but then I and then I when I texted you to say I'm having a siesta
C	I know we've all had a good hearty lunch but what I
B	I I fell asleep Mani and then I just and then I literally went into this dead sleep
D	I'm gonna go and get the pizza out
B	and that's when I was like burning up
F	well
B	find the
F	thermometer
B	thermometer because I couldn't I
F	thermo-mometer
B	Cos when you said are you're burning up I'll come round
C	why?
B	and I was actually gonna say to you yes but then I took a couple of Nurofen and then
C	why did that happen when you've come off the antibiotics? Is that the?
B	I don't know
C	yeah
B	the collar on my tee-shirt
C	but why? Why do you think that happened?
B	I don't know
F	you just need to rest and relax
B	I've pushed myself
C	just rest isn't it
F	yeah it er it's er
B	but I can't take
C	surveillance
B	I'm on under surveillance and I've been told that you know um apparently I've I've had because I had those
C	they're just watching you
B	they're just watching me so I can't have any days off
C	you have to be careful
B	maybe I've just got a bit of a cold or something
F	it all resets itself after the end of March anyway so
B	maybe it's because the antibiotics stopped on Tuesday
C	yeah
B	and then I I've really been I've
F	yeah what did you do on that Tuesday? You went to work and then you went out
B	I went
F	you went to
B	I had a half or beer a half of shandy
F	no I just think it's more the fact that you were up and about doing lots of things
C	that's it
B	but I had to  But I had to  push myself
F	it doesn't matter if you drink or not
B	I was on the verge of like you know I have
F	I know but you've gotta get into it slowly
B	then on Friday we got  Friday we got  into work at about nine
C	you didn't
B	both of us
F	two pints?
B	yeah okay fair enough two pints
F	no it adds up
C	she did
F	do you know what I'm saying?

F	no that's fine I not saying
C	we were out for ages
B	I don't know but I did feel dodgy after the meal
C	that's the meal
F	that meal wasn't great to be honest
C	I think  I think I think  what you're saying is
B	I think  I think  the problem
C	that it's the general going out rushing around and all of that isn't it?
F	yeah you've gotta give your body a chance to just
B	but I have to push it I have to
F	I know
B	maybe it was what I
F	nobody nobody er you don't want to be ill
B	what I  thought was cos I did have a  I did have a  bit of a cough
F	it's not that you can't be ill
B	and then
F	oh I see
B	it's probably not very good for anyone
C	what
B	yeah
C	I know
B	they're only like these bits
C	I know
B	but it was just cos I suddenly like I think if I'd have taken my temperature it had soared
