C	well we sort of said from three onwards so I'm assuming that means switch the barbecue on at three
B	yeah
C	erm
A	yeah
C	but like some people aren't they're coming from out of Cambridge so they might come either right at the beginning so they can get back early or they might come much later and one of my friends might be staying so I don't really know what sort of time people are planning to arrive
B	okay so you don't mind
C	I don't mind at all
C	because if like
C	someone comes for this period of time then they go and then these people come and it's all a little bit and I'm afraid that two of my friends who are each other's ex might be there like at the same time and dude it's kind of
E	what's that? oh
C	well whatever
F	oh it's trying to swim
C	well he's stuck
