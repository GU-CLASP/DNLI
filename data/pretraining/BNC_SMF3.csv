A	mm
B	give em a pressed flower picture
A	bit late to press flowers
B	I'm just going through the ideas

A	no
B	well what would you like? being a woman what would you like for Christmas? cos if you tell me you won't get it

A	oh
B	and it contains alcohol
A	mm
B	oh I didn't see em did I? why didn't you come running out and fetch me like you normally do?

B	oh
A	no
B	I can't shout when I've got a drill going and an er lathe going
A	well I didn't
B	and a grinder going
A	anyway they might be in touch in a little while
B	crawling
A	she can get back back back to where she wants to be
B	can she?
A	mm
A	mm
B	er they all have er they're all these babies have weird ways of crawling don't they? when they
A	mm
B	start off
A	yeah
B	I don't think
A	no
B	yeah
A	mm
B	and then walk round the furniture
A	mm
B	then when she could she'd have that little stool
A	that's when she was walking around yeah
B	and run run about er with that stool so that she could climb and get out the window
A	mm yeah
A	oh she was a nightmare
B	she was a nightmare
A	mm
B	and he had to have a tiger stick to keep her here
A	yeah
B	keep the tigers away so she wouldn't go in front too far
A	that's right
B	yeah that's er
A	er think it was just
B	was it
A	think it was
B	I don't think we did did we? yeah
A	yeah
B	and then er
A	mm
B	see how far she walks without er turning round
A	yeah
B	and we had to run after her didn't we? cos she didn't even turn round
A	we did
B	turn round to see where you are
A	yeah
B	no not
A	no
B	she's a
A	yeah
A	hard to believe isn't it? cos she just focused didn't she? and went
B	yeah
A	and you
B	yeah
A	she see cos she was determined to get that erm
A	sit on it
A	I'm gonna buy one so she saved up didn't she? all her birthday money and stuff
B	she did save up all her all her birthday money did she do a paper round? she didn't did she?
A	no
A	mm
B	couldn't even reach the pedals
B	and she wanted that one didn't she?
A	mm
B	she er it killed me cos they wanted they want money for or she wanted money for everything she did like go and hanging out the washing she'd got two pence for it
A	we paid them two pence yeah
B	two pence
A	hang the washing out
B	that was two pence too
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	without being paid for it
B	yeah
A	they did
B	you got family allowance that's enough that's that's money for us
A	she was quite young when she said that I can't
B	she heard it at school didn't she? or whatever
A	mm
B	she must've heard it at school
A	yeah
B	yeah
B	family allowance should be for us not for them
A	mm
A	mm
B	and she kicked em to pieces cos she didn't like em
A	oh yeah
B	didn't do her any good did it?
A	no
B	she had to wear them
A	I'm afraid you have to
B	I suppose she was showing off to the kids at school weren't she?
A	er her and
B	yeah
A	I don't know
B	no
A	mm
B	well
A	yeah
B	no
B	but er wearing high heels yeah
A	no they're not
A	yes they are
A	and then we happened to go to the dentist or something and she met her
B	yeah
A	none of them were in high heels
B	where are the high heels
A	oh well all the rest are
B	but you're not
B	not at thirteen years old anyway
A	not throughout your school it's silly
B	not throughout school no but I mean they might start wearing them at er
A	I don't actually think the school would
B	no course they wouldn't
A	no
B	but maybe
A	maybe they wouldn't allow much
B	not stiletto type heels
A	but then everyone's more sensible now now trainers are really fashionable anyway
B	that's brilliant that is ain't it?
A	yeah
B	cos they are sensible shoes that keep the feet
A	mm
B	really
A	although they did say no trainers at one time then they had to allow it didn't they?
B	yeah
A	I think
B	but maybe they don't because I think
A	yeah school shoes isn't it?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	this is where boys come come out better than girls ain't it? girls want to be all fashionable and what have you and boys've got shoes
A	mm
B	shoes shoes
A	that's right
B	there's no there's nothing really out of the ordinary with boys' shoes is there?
A	no
B	lace-up buckles or slip-ons
A	mm
B	they all look the same
A	wonder how
B	yeah they can can't they? yeah
A	yeah
B	well that's the problem er this is why they say school uniform's the best thing that they can wear
A	mm
B	because nobody's better than anyone else are they?
A	that's right
B	yeah
A	I can't wear that I wore that yesterday
B	yeah
A	people will know I wore it yesterday
A	mm
B	yeah
A	mm
B	well you had to wear them silly hats didn't you?
A	er
B	yeah
B	you've
A	I might have
B	it's in the shed I think
A	cos you like green anyway so
B	yeah
A	didn't like it
B	oh yeah
A	got it debobbled
A	but not not many girls wore boaters
B	well it does really yeah
A	they don't have hats any more do they? anywhere I don't think
B	I dunno Eton does
A	or Harrow
B	yeah
A	what? in Harrow?
B	that's Harrow girls' school is it?
A	there is a Harrow goats girls' school yeah
B	Eton
A	and Eton no
A	yeah
B	bit posh weren't it?
A	yeah
B	did you wanna go there?
B	did you? oh god
A	but you had to erm you had to get in
B	mm
A	but I didn't get in
B	well I told you before about us all us boys decided that we would not go to a posh school which was then the
A	mm
B	the
A	there were some other schools though weren't there?
B	no just just the
A	was that all?
B	that was er the catchment area for
A	no other choice?
B	no
A	mm
B	no
A	in the whole of
B	well I expect there was
A	no
B	but ours was the
A	was there one at
B	that's a posh school
A	well was there a grammar school at
B	oh I don't know
A	so what hats did they wear?
B	they had these stupid
A	caps
B	but they were they were had these covers on em on them
A	most had caps didn't they?
B	mm
A	school cap
B	anyhow that was that
A	no
B	and we didn't pass
A	so er
B	all us who didn't want to pass
A	mm
B	finished up in the A forms anyway
A	mm
B	there were streams there was A B C and D
B	oh right
A	to grammar school
B	did you?
A	yeah
B	oh well we didn't want to go
A	don't have to talk posh
B	oh yes you did
B	that's what we thought
A	yeah
B	okay
A	right
B	how to talk properly
A	what a shame I wonder where you'd've been if you'd've gone
B	well I'd've probably been prime minister now
A	I don't think so
B	why not?
A	no you don't
B	head of the Green Party that's me
A	you probably wouldn't've learn a lot more
B	well I tell you what I would rather
A	you learn other things as well
A	well you'd've learnt all the
B	Latin
A	that's only part of it isn't it?
B	well this is what put us off
A	they still do woodworking and stuff
B	they didn't do a lot in grammar schools
A	well I did er
B	they were academics
A	but I did art needlework and domestic science and things
B	well there was that there was that
A	took all my
B	yeah?
A	yeah
B	how many did you pass?
A	all of them
B	oh
A	yes
B	what did you get in maths?
A	I got an A in maths
A	it's been a long time
A	no it's only when I did pure maths that I lost it a bit
B	oh dear yeah
A	no pure maths is totally different
B	did you get paid for it?
A	no
B	why not?
A	well you just help people out don't you?
B	oh god
B	well of course
B	that's right
A	oh I just help people out I like I I like
B	oh I I have to say that you're a lot better at working out than I am
A	but yeah
B	yeah
A	how to logic and things come into it I think
B	yeah well we had arguments with our teacher well not arguments but
A	yeah well you don't don't use it really
B	and he said well it's not the use it's to get your mind working
A	yes
B	and that's what he told us
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	mm
B	yeah
B	oh god
A	C minus D
B	yeah
A	gets complicated but
B	equals two E
A	so what is A? or what is C?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	you have to think
A	really hard yeah
B	yeah and er that was
A	mm
B	the whole point of algebra
A	mm
B	whereas er we we couldn't see that
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	she was told she she has to
B	yeah
A	be able to chant them
B	we had to chant them
A	mm
B	every day
A	yeah
B	and that's really weird because chanting makes you remember
A	mm
B	yeah
A	keep singing the words of a song you get them
B	and then our teacher used to go
A	yeah
B	finger and say
A	we used to play a game called buzz
B	yeah
A	you buzzed when it was like seven or fourteen or twenty-one
B	oh I see
A	or whichever name you were
B	well yeah
A	mm yeah
B	that's how they try to do it nowadays make them into games don't they?
A	mm
B	so that people learn through games or fun rather than through
A	yeah
B	oh
A	I suppose most stuff you learn through er a bit of a play don't you?
B	well yes
B	yeah
A	you realise what you have to do
B	yeah well I mean
A	yeah
B	have to score
A	mm
A	oh dear
B	and I thought I'm not gonna get hit by that
B	I didn't get picked for football
A	you run away from the ball then?
B	I
A	yeah
B	and we were put on the tennis tennis courts
A	mm
B	cleaning up the leaves on the tennis courts
A	it's very bad isn't it? when they
B	yeah
A	they do pick the same people for teams
B	er all the time
A	so if you weren't any good in the beginning you'll never get a chance
B	no
A	to get good
B	no you don't
A	oh right
B	and I though oh you big
A	but there
B	no
A	cos there's never gonna be exactly the
B	no
A	I don't know if they've changed it now but you should all be able to play shouldn't you?
B	you should be
A	mm
B	but you see the two favourite boys was
A	yeah
B	that nobody wanted
A	yeah
B	and we went off cleaning up the tennis courts
A	mm
B	and that's how it was
B	it was unfair
A	yeah
B	but then the teachers the the the sports the PE teachers then were they wanted er to play you know a good game
A	yeah
B	they didn't want someone who who dawdled around
A	that's right
B	yeah that's right yeah
A	so if you're if there are any odd ones
B	mind you I got picked to run for for er
A	mm
B	I got picked for for
A	oh right
B	to run for
A	mm
B	and I was running against two other people
A	right
B	and I come last
A	right
B	so when I got back to to school they said er how did you get on where did you come and I
B	out of three of I was
A	dear
B	so ashamed of coming last I didn't want to tell em
A	you can't say I don't know though it sounds as though you're stupid
A	and they believed you of course?
B	no
B	no course they don't they weren't as daft as I was
B	yeah
A	well
A	instead of I don't know
A	he doesn't know what he's doing
B	no
A	probably in a different race
B	yeah
A	I I used to end up in like the obstacle race and things like that
B	did you do the obstacle race?
A	I was always in the obstacle race
A	you had to crawl under nets and stuff
B	that's right
A	and they get all tangled up
B	yeah
A	oh
B	oh god run with that yeah
A	and things like that
B	Blu-Tack weren't invented then though was it?
A	skip
B	yeah
A	you haven't got time to do that have you?
B	no no but if you had it in your pocket you could just stick it in your in the spoon and stick the egg on and run yay
A	ah
B	sack race
A	no that was all one thing the the
B	the sack race
A	obstacle
B	and the three-legged race
A	the sack the well I meant er that's what I had to do jump in the sack
B	oh yeah that was that one
A	do a bit of
B	yeah
A	skipping and then pick up the spoon and the egg and run and things like that
B	run yeah and always come last I bet you didn't come first either
A	I've never come first no
B	no
A	I don't know where I came but I never came first
B	no
A	ever
B	well there was thirty-two people in our class all throughout my schooling
A	yeah
B	school
A	mm
B	and my place was always fourteenth
A	right
B	so I was just average
A	mm
A	yeah
B	did come first in in er this was in the whole
A	mm
B	I come first in English
A	oh
B	I was flabbergasted
A	right
B	and that was without cheating
A	yes
B	three minutes to give a talk
A	mm
A	I was away I
A	I knew which day I was gonna do it and I made sure I was away
B	yeah mm
A	you don't realise that you think that's you've escaped all these things but you no
B	I I
A	it wasn't as bad as I thought in the end
B	no
A	but I was
B	so was I shaking in my boots
