A	thank you mum it looks nice
B	that's alright erm there's some Knorr Stock Pot
A	no
B	they come in little pots like that and they
A	oh right
B	they've got a lovely flavour do you want me to show you one?
A	mm
B	I'll show you
A	thank you
C	look at that bread
B	got these if you want to get them
A	oh right and they're better are they?
A	mm
A	mm
C	it does
A	you made the bread?
C	yes I did
A	mm
C	yes that is
B	oh is half and half? okay
C	mm the last part it just as I was tipping it in more wholewheat went in last time
B	ah I see
C	so this is actually a bit lighter
B	mm
A	mm lovely nice I like chicken soup
A	why?
A	that's true I don't
B	no
A	mm
B	cos it couldn't be easier could it? to make soup
A	no
B	dad was just saying the chickens that he gets from Waitrose three for ten pounds are actually the sizes are a bit smaller
B	but that's really good cos it means we could just have have it between the two of us
A	that's true
A	it's not natural that chickens are that big either
C	no
B	no
A	they've been too big for years they shouldn't be that size
B	oh right
A	you know they're more than er
A	yes
B	yes
C	yeah
A	in the Middle East they never get very big
A	they're always small
B	mm
A	but I think that's why they
B	oh right
B	yes
A	yeah I always get confused what the difference is
B	shepherd's pie is actually meant
C	lamb
A	oh
B	and cottage pie
A	okay
B	but I think a lot of us just called it shepherd's pie
C	yeah
A	yes I do like that
C	mm
B	mm
A	I don't make that ever
B	well I'll do it for another time
A	so we'll go on a walk after tea?
B	yes
C	mm
B	how far would you like to go?
A	ten miles?
B	well shall we just do the short one
A	yes
A	that sounds nice
A	we did do a swim
A	just to get some fresh air
B	and then we could check the viewings see if there's anything on
A	ah yeah
B	last night last night
A	mm it has
A	mm
A	yes
C	it's been
B	yes and we
A	mm
B	we had two days out on the road didn't we? cos going over to
A	mm
A	yes it's a long way
B	well I haven't looked
C	mm
B	I don't think there is and we watched Ben Fogle last night
A	wasn't as good
A	they were too happy
B	yes
A	you need people to be a bit miserable otherwise it's not really
B	yes
A	challenging viewing is it?
B	no
A	they were just having a nice time
B	yes it wasn't different enough was it?
A	no and er they didn't really answer the question what they did for money so it was all a bit suspicious
A	they didn't answer that at all did they?
B	no they didn't they
A	yes so it's not clear if er
C	perhaps
A	mm could be drug smuggling
C	mm
A	it's funny that pirates are so big now again
C	they're still around aren't they?
A	more aren't they?
C	yes
A	around Sudan
C	the last twenty years it's all come back
A	mm
B	oh yes
A	oh yes that's true there's lots of jobs aren't there? for ex-army
B	yeah
C	mm
A	mm
A	because they pay for private protection now
C	security mm
B	yes and it's very good wages
A	mm but very dangerous if you
C	yes
A	if there is an incident you've kind of had it haven't you?
C	yeah yeah
B	yeah yes
A	you know even with one or two of you what are you going to do?
C	yeah
B	no I think what his plan is is to try this and try and live at home
A	mm
B	or near home and they'll
A	yeah
C	did you say if there was
B	mm mm
B	mm
A	yes I would like some thank you
B	I might
A	mm that's really good
B	erm I might just have no vegetable
A	that's alright
B	yes it was and it was just so easy
A	mm
B	boiled it for about three quarters of an hour
A	oh right
B	and just left it cos I couldn't be bothered with it last night
A	but I think it's better to leave it actually cos the flavours develop probably more
A	and then today you just put in the vegetables with it?
A	oh with the chicken? oh that was sensible yeah saves time
B	yeah because then you're getting more of the flavours aren't you?
A	mm
B	and then just the stock cube today
A	oh right
B	and I put a bouquet garni in
A	mm
A	yes
B	no salt because
A	ah good
B	mm
A	yes that's right
B	I did a little bit of erm the grass round the edge of the middle flower bed
A	oh
B	I was quite
A	ah that was good
B	and then I planted the
A	yes I saw that
B	and then I got in my bed
A	really?
B	yeah
B	and and that was it
A	mm
C	just get some lumps out of it
A	like you had yes
A	yes
A	ah yes can you just hold onto them?
B	yes that's fine
A	not too much in the way
B	no cos
A	yes
B	okay I'll keep hanging onto books
A	yes that would be nice since I won't have any money
A	or any work when I come back
A	then that'll be good at least I can read
A	I'll wait I think if I want to change jobs I need to not take the first thing that comes along too quickly
C	no
A	but erm yes what I really need is just a few thousand savings but then I can get by for the winter can't I?
B	yes yes that's right
A	don't need much
B	no no you don't
A	thank you
A	yes that's good
B	yes well you can be looking can't you? while you're away
A	yeah that's right mm
A	yes I won't spend anything
B	no
A	and I'll try and do lots of
B	oh yes that's good so you've got er quite a bit to bring back with you then in the next few months?
A	hopefully
C	do you think there's any in
A	there er
A	there's only one company for the south west and they're based out of
C	they're based at
A	based out of
C	ah
A	but they do examine from time to time in
C	yes
A	I am looking
A	yes the problem is that it expires quite quickly
C	oh
A	and then you have to start the whole training all over again
C	ah
A	which they only do once a year
A	and then it's a whole weekend gone
A	more than one weekend actually and you're not paid for the training
B	oh right
A	so that's what
B	oh right okay
A	it's really hard to motivate yourself to do all the training again
B	oh yes
A	someone else suggested to me there's a different sort of exam here
B	oh right okay
A	look to see if anywhere is that is more
C	yeah
A	a bigger thing here
B	yes
A	I emailed
B	yes that's good
A	no
B	yeah well that's good
C	yeah
A	but anyway they don't have one in Bahrain
B	oh er right okay
A	yeah not
C	I'm
C	well that one to go
A	okay
C	oh
B	ah
A	the British Army's got one
C	oh right
A	and it's done in levels
C	yeah
A	like level one beginner
C	yeah
A	who can't do anything
A	yes I just did level one
B	oh
A	well part of level one
A	it was quite good
C	yeah
A	it gives you little medals
A	when you do it
C	mm
A	and it asks you to log how many you've done
C	how many levels does it have?
A	actually I'm not sure
C	oh it can happen can't it?
B	yes it's not surprising
A	no and I've been there quite a while
B	mm
A	cos you just don't do any incidental exercise so it's all got to be an effort
B	mm
A	you know but and I don't like going to the gym
A	then I don't do it
B	no that's it
A	I only do it occasionally cos I don't enjoy it
B	no
A	I swim but then it's probably just maintaining existing
C	mm
B	yes
A	whatever state you're at it will just maintain that won't it?
B	mm
A	maybe you'll
B	mm
A	over time but you're not really going to
B	mm
A	suddenly lose weight
B	so you'll have something to focus on when you come back
A	yes that'll be nice actually
B	mm
A	having the time
B	yeah and the
A	yes
A	there was something in the paper in that awful
A	you know we were saying they were consulting on it a couple of weeks ago?
C	mm
A	well apparently that's all been agreed now
B	oh right
A	and it's going through the two main cemeteries on
B	is it?
A	I don't
B	mm so that was better
A	it will be better than the er what you have to do now you know
B	yeah
A	you know sort of bits
A	on a pavement alongside a very busy main road
C	they're like
A	yes yeah so it's sensible what they've suggested
C	mm
A	yes that's right
C	mm
B	there hasn't
A	yes
B	it I mean it's taken off into the cities
B	you know
A	yes that's right
C	mm
B	mm
A	not try and retro fit it years later
C	not yeah cos they subtract them from the
B	no
A	mm
C	car
A	yeah
C	which then you can't get
A	no they've got to do it at the time
B	yes
C	mm
A	it was excellent there wasn't it?
B	and Copenhagen
A	mm
B	mm
C	erm could you pass the bread please?
B	mm
A	mm nice
B	mm it is nice
A	yes
C	yes it's
B	you see that's good you've done half half cos that actually
C	yeah
C	well if a hundred percent means you don't eat it
A	yes that's true
C	then fifty percent would be better than a hundred percent
A	that's true
C	cos you're having
B	mm
C	half of it
A	yes
C	instead of none of it
B	that was very nice
A	it was nice
A	oh dear that's bad
B	yes
A	and do you erm don't have to chop all the seeds up?
C	no er
A	no? they just come like that?
C	I've got I've got get a packet
A	ah they're already chopped?
C	yeah they're like pumpkin seeds
A	ah that's good ah yes that's good
C	sesame seeds and sunflower seeds
A	cos that'd be annoying
A	yes
B	well you might decide to make bread
A	yes I might and you can always use gluten free flour
B	ah yes
A	if you are worried about it
A	it doesn't rise as well but you can just add more yeast
C	mm
B	mm
A	yes and I think a lot of it is just the way that modern bread is made
B	mm
A	that's too fast
B	mm
A	that it's changed cos you don't leave it leave it to
B	yes
A	prove or rise or whatever it's called
B	mm
C	yeah
A	but that does make sense doesn't it? because it was a
C	mm mm well alive
A	yes and it takes time
C	mm
A	so if you then take that stage out
C	yeah
B	mm
A	then something different's happened to the food
B	your dad sometimes puts half of it in the freezer if we're not
B	that's
B	but
A	mm
B	but you get used to having it a bit thicker erm so when you have er sliced bread it seems very very thin
A	mm
B	sliced bread
A	mm yes please
C	herbal tea?
A	yes please
B	mm ah yes there's some mint in on the window sill there's
A	mm
A	yes please
C	six? is that what
B	no I'll have an ordinary tea please
A	I'll have er three leaves
B	oh you only have three do you? is that enough?
A	for me it is
B	ah yes I don't know how many they're meant to put in
A	as many as you want
B	yeah but to be
B	I'll google it tonight
A	they normally say a sprig
B	oh
A	but I don't know how big their sprig is
B	a really really good crop because you know they're sort of multiplying all the time so er I've had
A	really?
B	yeah
A	wow
B	so I hope they get to a good size but I think they will
A	mm
B	so it's quite exciting
A	mm
A	then you'll panic cos
B	erm no I don't I don't think so I think it'll be fine I'll I'll
A	mm
B	just you know I don't want to waste
A	no
B	er
A	yes it is a bit
A	mm no they don't
B	mm
A	give some to grandpa
B	well yes I could put some away that'd be nice as well wouldn't it?
A	mm
B	he'd be pleased
A	yes he would
B	cos he knows this is my first go at growing anything
A	mm
B	yes he did
A	oh
B	he used to grow tomatoes
A	oh really? oh
B	yeah
A	you should tell him that
A	remind him
B	yes and erm
A	oh right
A	mm
A	mm
B	used to get paid threepence an hour
A	oh right that was nice
A	mm
B	but I don't know what else he grew
A	but did he do all the garden stuff?
B	yes
A	oh that was
A	mm
B	so it was less but it was a tremendous amount of work
B	mm
A	mm
B	and then er he did the gardens with
A	yeah
B	and again I think it would've been a lot of work
B	yeah less than here
A	yeah it's less flowerbeds mm
B	yes but still
A	and it's quite well established but still
B	yes
A	mm
B	yes less flowerbeds so there aren't actually that many if you if you've got er
A	no
B	a ride-on mower and just ignore the hedges then it wouldn't be so much to do would it?
A	no
B	mm
A	yes it's
A	yes
B	the house is bad on the outside isn't it?
A	yes it's kind of rotting
A	wooden bits
B	well I suppose it's just it's not worth spending money on it
A	no
B	so hopefully it will last
A	yes
A	ah
B	but there's another one hanging off
C	mm
A	I'm surprised
B	well yes
A	oh she's gone today?
B	yes
A	ah so she would've missed
B	er
A	mm
B	but she's going to see
A	ah yes
B	so she's gone today seeing her friend I imagine staying the night and
A	ah yes
B	so that's
B	oh yes
A	but she must be flying at a different time
B	maybe ah yes just
A	yes
B	but anyway you never know you might see her at the airport I
A	mm yeah that's true
B	I could send her an email
A	mm
A	I did thank you yes it's nice
A	it's nice it's very sweet
B	oh yeah
A	I couldn't have that much of it
A	I'll clear up
A	ah yes that's good
A	it's very sweet yes
B	the carrot cake was fine wasn't it? that was nice
A	mm yes that was lovely
B	would you make cakes?
A	no I haven't done
B	haven't
A	I made tea bread once
B	oh right yes that's
A	oh next time
B	mm
A	thank you
A	oh that's nice yes I should make cakes
A	I've got that book of baking from the National Trust
B	ah yes

A	mm
B	oh yeah that's that'll be good I
A	mm that's nice
B	yes so I'll make some more buns tomorrow
A	yes
B	your dad likes the tea bread as oh you know he loves fruit cakes but
A	yes
A	yes that sounds good
B	and I'll take
A	mm
B	cos when I do it I make three
A	sorry?
A	oh
A	they probably didn't know did they?
B	madness
A	that's
B	mm
A	it's not exactly a desert
A	oh November oh
A	in the newspaper last week it
A	because the transport minister was asked and he said October
A	that's very bad
A	but they've committed to a date now haven't they? yeah so that's good yes it is good yeah
B	so I can come if I get my
A	ah yes that's nice yes
B	depends how many trains there are
