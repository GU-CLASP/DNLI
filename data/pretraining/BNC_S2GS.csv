A	that's the first set of batteries it's used though so
B	particularly as you're getting the batteries from er
A	mm
A	mm
B	wow awesome
A	leisurely cyclist
B	I'm just thinking to myself what a small person
A	tiny person
B	just scaled down
A	not particularly
B	well no I wouldn't say that but er
B	we're actually doing very well
A	I was going to say we're we're actually moving a quite a reasonable pace
B	what a good piece of cycling that is on a phone
A	is he?
B	he's got a phone in his left hand
B	Christ
A	is that?
B	wow look at that guy on the bike
A	nice umbrella
B	he's just holding it like a long sword
A	ha ha
B	yeah
A	like Hagrid's got a a wand disguised as an umbrella
B	sort of
A	hmm mm
B	well I don't think it's progress
A	mm
B	oh dear
A	there's some people who have seen the full sign and are just carrying on
B	one in there
A	mm
B	tiny legs
A	who has?
B	the woman in the horrible coat
A	it's beautiful
B	well that's that's just a powered bicycle
A	they're cool those
B	oh dear
A	I like the guy with his er Bentley
B	yeah
D	where's he going?
B	the big
A	the massive
B	the big Bs give it away on the tyres
A	ah yes
B	sorry?
A	not parking that in the multi-storey is he?
B	I'd be amused to see him try
A	that'd be very funny
D	key his car
A	sorry?
D	someone key his car
A	ha ha
B	well I have actually considered suggesting that he employs two like outriders and motorcycles
A	huh huh
B	exactly
A	yeah
D	yeah
A	it's a bit like dad actually
D	that's so that he can have a walk though
A	is it? Oh okay
D	gotta earn the fact that you've driven somewhere
A	yeah
B	yes of course that car is beautifully blocking all the side exits
A	yeah
D	I like her coat
A	nice isn't it
D	that there
A	I should get a spring coat
B	ice sock
A	cool
B	what?
A	I thought you meant like a sock
B	oh that's what it means
A	well it's a pair of ice-skating ice-skates
B	I didn't see those
A	oh
B	this may be where things slow down slightly
A	it was moving
D	what's he doing?
A	yeah that's it just reverse into a pedestrian there
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	hmm
B	again
A	ha
B	you're not going anywhere
D	she could have put her hand in the air rather than any er direction
B	I know
A	hello
B	there is actually a
A	oh is it an angle of arm
B	and it it's not sort of an optional extra
A	oh I know but like people who signal but they just kind of vaguely sort of flick their hands out in a sort of limp kind of way
B	well that's a lot of pedestrians
A	you wanna party there?
D	yeah
A	mm
D	well they didn't look French
A	fair enough
B	they looked foreign
B	wow
D	which one? The one that's in cream fur thing
A	cream coat there
D	oh right yeah
A	looks really
B	what you mean just lying somewhere
A	yeah there's there's the hood must have come off the coat and it's just lying
D	maybe from one of the youths from the youth centre
D	I think it's an excellent idea
A	no it's really good
D	not doing any harm
A	not causing any problems
B	mm
A	Great
D	and then they feel hardcore as well cos they're like hanging out somewhere
A	well there's a lot of them stand outside the youth centre
D	yeah
A	I think trying to be
D	yeah
A	that's fine
D	and their parents know where they are
A	ha
B	go on
A	ha ha
B	oh
A	oh

A	hmm mm
B	no take your time
A	ha ha
B	might be some
A	mm mm
B	now that is double declutching into first which isn't normally that er common
A	hmm mm
D	this is a really weird car park
B	it's a really cool car park
D	sort of like new age look
A	this isn't actually the car park yet
D	and this is really bizarre
A	ah
D	it's like Sutton Bank
B	yeah
A	yeah no I I noticed that
A	hmm?
D	do you know about
A	we drove up
D	it's the bank where dad tried to get up it in the little red polo
A	ha
D	on the way to
B	oh yeah
A	I think I think you know it's just it really could
D	but the Berlingo could manage
A	it's not that impressive
D	but it's just the fact that yeah the little polo didn't make it well nearly didn't make it
A	just paranoia
D	really?
A	yeah
D	oh
B	right
A	ha ha
A	okay
B	that was pretty scary
A	ah
B	what?

B	er well considering we just get a lift with the suitcase anyway yeah
A	I was gonna say it it makes no difference
