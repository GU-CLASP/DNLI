A	yeah so erm
B	fascists
A	you know
A	I know I went for an interview at erm near Waterloo and they were
B	right yeah
A	er no well I mean I thought I would enjoy that erm
B	ah
A	but it wasn't er you know it just fell apart didn't it?
B	it just fell apart
A	I mean the the facilities were there
B	mm
A	never taught in like a place like that
B	sometimes there were students
A	yeah sometimes with the students
B	no
A	think he lost interest cos it was depressing for him
B	well yeah yeah and it's weird isn't it?
B	for
A	he didn't mind one-to-one but I mean erm
B	it's a different lesson it's a
A	yeah
B	you can prepare a one-to-one lesson that's fine but you don't know if it's gonna be a one-to-one lesson or a group of ten
A	it's different
A	it's just a shame but erm
B	it is a shame but then
A	no hopeless
B	a meddler
A	not interested
B	not interested and and at the same time a meddler
A	yeah
B	pain in the arse but they've done something with the paths round here haven't they?
A	it looks yeah they've cordoned it cordoned it off with rope
B	yeah
A	it looks it looks a bit more
B	and these must be new over there
A	maybe they're trying to protect the grass more
B	yeah maybe
A	using
B	yeah
A	unofficial
B	maybe some
A	but there's a lot more growth I mean all that all that all those leaves you could see the wall before
B	oh yeah
A	you can't see the wall cos it that's that's summer growth
B	is that a lime tree is that?
A	is it a lime tree?
B	I dunno
B	no no
A	so what what do they call a lime tree then?
B	I dunno
A	lime tree go on
B	must be like an cos they're native trees so it must be an olde olde olde
A	right yeah probably
B	don't know and we can look that up later
A	fascinated by squirrels
B	yeah
A	through
B	oh okay
A	they weren't interested in the view could see Big Ben London Eye you know the things you'd think
B	weren't they?
A	visitors
B	alright
A	to London would be interested in
A	they were just fascinated by these little squirrels
B	yeah
A	and they were taking pictures of them videos of them and and the
B	yeah
B	I mean they
A	they'd be in someone's pot
A	oh yeah
B	and erm
A	well no
B	right
A	bamboo forests but they don't mate very well in the wild so so
B	even
A	so that's why and they use them for
B	so even if
A	no
B	oh
A	I mean Chris Packham you know that funny er naturalist
A	a naturalist he's a conservationist
B	a
A	he said he said yeah you should let let let it have a natural death sort of thing
B	oh okay
A	but I mean erm
B	but
A	some ways like if they're really mating
B	if they can't be bothered
A	the students can't be bothered what are you doing?
A	jumping up and down like a maniac but
A	the pandas can't be bothered
A	it's they're bizarre animals though they really are
B	mm mm what are they? are they? they're just pandas they're not bears are they
A	bear they're a type of bear
B	are they? oh
A	yeah
B	uhu
B	okay
A	cat bear so I dunno what
A	I don't know why they call them cat bears
B	they sleep a lot
A	yeah
B	mm have they got other bears there?
A	I think they do
B	Wild China I've seen
A	there are
B	a few of them
A	very nice areas where there is still wildlife you know where they
B	mm mm
A	tend to be remote and things
B	oh
A	I remember going outside the town I was teaching in in the countryside looking for wildlife
B	right
A	I was
B	and
A	over-farming
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	lunchtime jog
B	oh yeah because I remember watching
A	really?
B	and there was yeah there was a Chinese there was a guy in the east of
A	oh no
B	mm got ambushed or something
A	wow yeah they do exist in the
B	yeah yeah
A	deep forest I suppose yeah
B	mm
A	and most of China is like
B	mm
A	most of the population is sort of squashed into
A	one third of the country the other two thirds
B	right
A	are very sparsely populated
B	uhu
A	so
B	I bet
A	one billion people but not
B	mm
A	you know
B	yeah
B	oh really?
A	boy's caught a pigeon what is he doing? bit of animal cruelty isn't it? I was hoping he'd trip up on the rope
B	it's a bit
A	things students do eh?
B	oh it's so funny
A	looks like the class clown doesn't he?
A	it's like his head's been wedged down a loo and flushed
B	is he the one that had the pigeon?
A	yeah
B	something like that
A	oh dear
B	Tibet yeah the the the the the girl I asked
A	and
B	mm
A	yeah
B	and then I said
B	that
A	that's the that's just one of the standard phrases that gets
B	and then I
A	yeah
B	let's not discuss politics
B	mm
A	and they've been under house arrest for years now
B	okay
A	yeah I mean there are lots of people in China who would
B	mm hm
A	they did invade and take it over
B	uhu
A	but they were their own country you know
B	mm
A	but the People's Republic incorporated it
B	this
A	as as Xinjiang as well where
B	kicking yeah
A	kicking off
B	yeah
A	because they
B	I and and and that yeah that that could be a bit of a
A	well
B	I suppose not
A	are they with a full beard and they're not gonna look like a you know?
B	like that yeah
A	what most people think like do you know what I mean
B	yeah
A	it's like it's a very na√Øve approach to take to
B	right
A	anti-terrorism
A	who that's just their culture
B	mm
A	and they're not terrorists
A	that's just the this is the this is the thing
A	so that's the so it's like a sledge
B	right
A	and that's what rubs them the wrong way with the local people
A	and they
A	is lacking in the
B	mm
A	I dunno
B	well that's what I mean that girl surprised me because I thought she would be
B	she's a bit more kind of
B	liberal
A	no I mean
B	it's the
A	the younger generation
B	mm yeah
A	cos that that gets drummed
B	bedtime reading
A	that gets drummed
A	you know
B	she's gonna sort of be reading some nice you know child story or Chang'e
A	I I well the
B	mm mm
A	what they mean is continuous history and and or political
B	oh I know
A	it's always contentious you know?
A	I mean people will
B	mm
A	people nor nations
B	no no it's crazy isn't it?
A	even South Korea's
B	yeah
A	the government doesn't want competition I said no
B	no
A	it's a political thing they don't want people to they don't they want control of how people communicate
B	yeah
A	and that's what it's about in these days no matter how much they dress it up
B	mm
A	and they can well
B	so is that what they say they don't want the competition?
A	the Party are very clever they'll always dress it up in nationalist terms
B	oh yeah
A	and then
B	mm mm
A	Baidu and all those places so
B	okay
A	is still there so that
A	and they get support from
B	was he?
A	and er yeah and the government in China's been targeting foreign companies to make examples of them
B	er
A	spying and espionage and
B	er
A	there's a lot of Cold War stuff goes on still
B	ah
A	so
B	well it sounds yeah yeah
B	and the this kid there's one student lad I
A	really yeah yeah
B	oh
B	mm
A	political books he's going to take back and read so
B	free
B	so where are they now? still in Paris?
A	in Paris
B	no it's crazy
A	they went to Montmartre which is a a very historical area
B	yeah
A	but because of their their
B	and they're still there
B	where in Germany are they going?
A	Frankfurt and Berlin
B	why Frankfurt?
A	I dunno
B	no that's what I thought
A	I'd rather go to Munich
B	yeah yeah yeah Munich's a nice little place little place did I say little place? it is a little place
A	I mean I don't know why they're going there but then they're very brave they they they haven't booked in advance they're just going on trains and youth hostelling and
B	oh okay
A	you know very independent but erm
B	oh
A	they have
B	mm
A	Paris syndrome where they arrive and because it's not like how they see it in the movies or TV in Japan they they get a shock
A	and some of them had to go back on the plane and I
B	well
A	it's funny isn't it cos travel is all about expectation
B	mm hm
A	but if you have no expectations
B	yeah
A	if you have such weird high expectations of a place
B	but then again Paris probably
A	you know
B	yeah I was talking about it to
A	yeah
B	everyone comes to see it bollocks if it's not there
A	but
B	mm
B	yeah
A	Lisbon or wherever
B	mm mm
A	so people might say well if you have time oh don't bother going to Paris
B	don't bother going to Paris
A	think there's that danger now because erm
B	yeah that's what people say
A	the Paris
B	but I've always found them to be and there's a new sort of younger generation of people there who are kind of
B	probably
A	they don't care about that no no you're right you're right
B	no no no
A	and there's so many French people in London
B	yeah exactly and and London and that connection between London and Paris is seen as a
A	yeah yeah yeah yeah it's
B	opportunity so why would you sort of be an arrogant fool and pretend you can't speak English just so that
A	oh no
B	you for pride or whatever I dunno
A	cos the other side of the coin is we used to go there speak French and they
B	no
A	I think might be changing
B	erm you know
A	I haven't been there for years
B	yeah quite like Paris
A	I'd like to go to France again soon cos it will practise French you know? I haven't practised it in years
B	yeah
A	oh right yeah no that would be nice
A	I know World War One
B	or as it's that
A	yeah I know definitely
A	might be might be
B	it will be interesting though
A	definitely in the future no yeah definitely
B	cos
A	no
A	that's the thing you have different interests don't you as a couple?
B	yeah no and I'm glad about that you know?
A	you don't have to
A	yeah
B	her friends and does her things and I go out and do my things
A	exactly
B	yeah
A	yeah
A	that's the way it should be
B	yeah
B	yeah everything together yeah
A	yeah
A	my wife's friends
B	you gotta sit there and er er
A	couple of them are very nice but the things they talk about I'm not
B	yeah you're not interested are you?
A	really into
B	yeah
A	but not to go out specifically to meet them
B	don't go out
A	it's cos that's when problems occur when you're forced to do everything together
B	yeah
A	I don't think you should be
B	and I think that you should
A	you need your space
B	yeah yeah and allow them to talk the way they talk and to be the way they are do what they wanna do
A	exactly
A	cos
A	you know if we sort of met
B	yeah
A	TEFL and stuff
B	yeah yeah
A	no it's well I've always found that funny as well
B	it's that bloke again
A	oh yeah
B	where did he go? I dunno
A	maybe he's doing er Tavistock as well
B	maybe
A	those shirts are very hot actually aren't they?
B	I've never erm
A	I don't find them very cool to wear
B	I've never erm
A	football yeah erm
B	yeah
A	what you wanna wear is sort of like a loose cotton thing
B	those you sweat like a
A	yeah
B	sweaty thing
A	I dunno why I mind you I don't know maybe the technology's moved on the
B	cool as in temperature
A	yeah
A	even if
B	season after next
A	after so not even next season
B	not even next so the the scam going at the moment is
A	that's a long way
B	if you buy a season ticket this year you'll have priority on the last on the final season at Boleyn at you know the Boleyn ground
A	you don't need priority there'll be hundreds of seats empty it's a massive stadium
B	well you see what they reckon they're gonna do is every match is gonna have a theme to it so next season is gonna be a
A	what dress up as crocodiles? or
B	well I dunno er yeah what kind of theme
A	they're trying to
B	I think that's what it's all about
A	what do they mean theme?
B	I dunno
A	like what? bring bring your own wine or something
B	I dunno bring your own tomatoes to throw
B	and then and then and then if you have a ticket for that that season you'll be on a priority list for the season after in the new stadium which is what eighty thousand seater they're not gonna sell that out in a hurry are they? if they have a diabolical couple of seasons which is highly likely
B	mm
B	but apparently they're gonna be themed
A	how strange
B	no I couldn't afford it
A	it's expensive isn't it?
B	it's expensive to watch a pile of muppets running
A	yeah
B	you know and it
A	so they're not famed for like Luton
B	they they
B	West he's Sam is Big Sam's famous for his long ball game isn't he?
A	oh I see okay
B	so you know the fans react to that say we we're West Ham we run with the ball
A	oh yeah
B	just in front of their own goal and I said to the guy next to me
A	just for the sake of it
B	it'd be nice if they yeah exactly you know oh look oh look we can pass but
A	the ball doesn't really move up the pitch
B	no no
A	so is Upton park or whatever it's called
B	Boleyn ground
A	Boleyn ground
B	Upton park
A	is it is it nice a nice stadium or?
B	it's a nice sort of you know one of those stadiums where you're here and there's the pitch
A	right
B	you know and you get a smack in the face with the ball and that sort of thing
A	are the stands comfortable?
B	and
A	is it nice?
B	I went to one
A	historical?
B	yeah yeah it's a nice little ground
A	is the ground Victorian or is er art deco or is it like Arsenal's? Highbury used to be or? what sort of period
B	not as grand as Highbury
A	no
B	it's no I don't think it's as it's no it's as
A	any any architecture?
B	no it's a bit
A	so they might knock the whole thing down and
B	I would imagine they would
A	build something there
B	yeah there's no nice facades that they would keep
A	cos Highbury they kept the
B	yeah
A	main stand that was beautiful
B	yeah
A	and then the middle is
B	mm mm mm
A	that's a long so they won't that's a bit strange the stadium won't be ready until season after next
B	I don't know no isn't didn't you say there's some athletics going on there or something?
A	oh yeah the World Championships
B	so perhaps they're waiting till after that
A	ah
B	oh is it? oh
A	or they'll make it so that the
B	it's retractable isn't it?
A	stands already isn't it?
B	mm
A	I think or maybe not maybe that's what they have to work on
B	maybe that's what they're doing
A	god it's very hot isn't it?
B	it is in the sun
A	it's intense
B	oh yeah
A	oh yeah so erm
B	yeah yeah
A	wouldn't be university students here unless they've come from pre-sessional that's the other thing I need to almost go round with flyers and grab students to like for my studies it's terrible
B	oh
A	even the pilot but this is the problem nowadays even my pilot study
B	uhu
A	only one person replied
B	really?
A	so this is people who know me or a
B	yeah
A	and they're not even bothering to reply and the
A	to take part in your main study can you imagine?
B	never gonna happen
A	I think research is all
B	okay
A	to have any value
B	yes yes yes yeah yeah
A	I think that's t'ai chi I think
B	I well I was wondering if it is t'ai chi it looks more like something she's made up
B	seen a bit of t'ai chi
A	it's not bad though I suppose
B	although I've got an interesting corpora at the moment
A	have you?
B	well that's part of my argument for erm course book design really
A	oh is it part of your study?
B	well not this but yeah
A	ah
B	in general corpora and is
A	and how is your writing going?
B	well it was alright it was bit it was a bit slow last week last last week or the week before? but that was I think going away and then coming back and being a bit disruptive
A	oh yeah how was Devon?
B	lovely
A	like my dad's still down there in
B	still?
A	yeah they had to
B	this is not where you lived while you were there? no you lived next
A	no my dad my parents bought a
B	okay
A	it was like a little holiday home they're one of the Londoners who out-price locals and
B	bloody hell
A	yeah sorry
B	mind you
A	well everyone who lives there lives from
B	right yeah yeah
A	well
B	so you're doing them a favour by buying stuff
A	cos the
B	no no not at all
A	I was thinking that when I was down there last time they people are
B	not at all
A	if you don't have a car you're screwed
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	to get up there from
A	by bus
B	take a bus?
A	and the bus drivers are nutters down there we took the coastal bus
B	I know this road like the back of my hand
A	I know that's what it's like isn't it? you little country
A	bus
B	yeah yeah
A	it was like
B	well I I noticed that
A	I mean
B	yeah there's a lot of boy racers down that part
A	but you don't know there's a car coming
B	no
A	round the corner
B	sixty mile an hour yeah
A	who's just veered to the right and
B	yeah
A	is gonna have a head-on collision
B	yeah I know it's very true
A	yeah my friend was a bit like that on the Isle of Wight he drove a bit manically round the lanes it's like
B	your brother did that?
A	no a friend I have who moved
B	your brother was
A	yeah my brother's also
B	I've never been to the Isle of Wight
A	two
B	no
A	it's nice you can get the ferry from Victoria or Waterloo you go straight to Portsmouth the ticket includes the ferry
B	hovercraft?
A	to no erm
A	fast of sort of speed
B	oh
B	oh yeah
A	you can get a hovercraft but they're not that frequent
B	and how much is that?
A	oh
B	but then what do you do are you stranded when you get to the other end?
A	er well no you can you can walk
B	and that must be a nicer place than Portsmouth
A	yeah it is yeah I mean Isle of Wight's got all that interesting stuff you can see you know like sort of
B	mm
A	old Roman ruins sort of the nice countryside country walks
B	mm
A	garlic farm
B	and you were there recently weren't you?
A	about three months ago yeah
B	oh yeah that's right yeah yeah
A	with
B	oh that's
A	have to go some time
B	like to go everywhere
A	that's the problem isn't it? I was just sitting in there I mean two hours in the morning was enough for me sitting down
B	yeah
A	it's
B	yeah
A	typing away
B	each day
A	I mean
B	mm hm
A	I try and do that a lot and then I do notes on the laptop I read PDFs and I do some research online I try and mix it up a lot but if I sat and wrote I could do that but for like hour and a half two hours stop
B	oh I can't
A	yeah I know don't blame you
B	it's nice and warm I might take my trousers off
A	end of conversation
B	yeah is that that?
A	yeah er yeah no it's erm
B	is that them girls that were doing the dance a minute ago?
A	no
B	where were they from then?
A	don't know
B	let's listen
A	I think that'll be Taiwan or China
B	I'm
B	are there big
A	well?
B	they're Chinese speaking aren't they?
A	well if they are then they could be Taiwanese
B	okay
A	cos that's more the American diet
B	aha
A	fast food stuff and
B	right
A	there was this wonderful stand-up comedian from China she was making a joke about people from Shandong province
B	uhu?
A	and she said
A	and she said when you see people you see people doing drugs in Shandong like a line of coke they're not doing drugs she they
A	they're doing salt
B	salt
A	it's
A	but it's true I had a student from Shandong
B	uhu
A	and he put
B	where's
A	the
B	yeah
A	but they
B	maybe that's where that girl's from
B	okay
A	erm
B	right
A	and that's what makes it tasty at the end of the day you know?
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	it's not
B	yeah
A	but it's it's the salt
