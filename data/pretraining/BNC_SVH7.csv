B	what's better?
A	some food
B	oh good
A	I bet you anything my dad'll have that sandwich when we get there
B	sorry?
A	I bet you anything my dad'll have that sandwich when we get there
B	why would he have that sandwich?
A	well
B	eat it tomorrow as a snack
A	okay
B	why would he eat it?
A	I really imagine him being like oo
B	why?
A	I don't know
B	the whole day?
A	yeah
B	why?
A	Cos that's more what their days are like
B	so it's nothing like say in athletics where you don't wanna train before you
A	well yeah
B	compete
A	I'm as I said it I was just thinking that
B	perhaps she presumably got to charge for this?
A	presumably got to?
B	charge for the fact you were receiving instruction for all the way through the day
A	no no
B	oh
A	um we were well
B	expensive? How much do dance lessons oh God cost per session?
A	yeah
B	how many in a class?
A	it varied from upper
B	really?
A	yeah
B	how on
A	I think it was argued to be a sort of enriching experience
B	oh I figured it was only going to be a recreational activity
A	mm
B	you shouldn't be allowed time off school
A	yeah
B	like if I'd been a head teacher I wouldn't have allowed that
A	but I mean sort of er like obviously
B	why should you be allowed to do that but the
A	no I'm not  I'm not  saying
B	parents not be allowed to take kids on holiday?
A	I'm not saying that was right
B	yeah but it's one day repeatedly over the year
A	not that many a year
B	okay
A	mm
B	oo there's an interesting legal grey area
A	yeah
B	Cos they are legally obliged to provide
A	mm
B	but social services probably could
A	yeah
B	not really
A	yeah
B	Cos most people's kids are still quite young
A	yeah
B	but to be honest
A	yeah
B	it's a very different type of office
A	it is
B	yes
A	well
B	obviously you have a massive
A	mm
B	majority of men
A	I'm not sure it would make much difference though
B	of course it will because
A	if you  if you  wanna go on holiday both of you would go
B	yeah but there's holidays for mother
A	from from a child-care perspective
B	yeah exactly
A	yeah from a childcare perspective the mother might do it I guess
B	sorry?
A	the moon's really weird
B	well that's gonna be an M and S lorry there
A	huh
B	oh yeah wow that's low
A	what the moon? Yeah it's funny isn't it?
B	I thought is that a reflection?
B	no that's actually just the moon
A	are you er you can understand all the kind of I like thinking about like in the past when they didn't know what the sun and the moon were and the stars
B	surely swan-road would be a river not
A	yeah
B	the sea?
A	I dunno why they call it a swan-road
B	hm
A	they're quite keen on those things
B	what's the Old English word for swan?
A	probably swan
B	mm
A	and road's probably rad
B	hm
A	I was thinking the other thing I need to get while we're at
B	right
A	um quite useful when I as I'm rewriting it
B	yeah
A	I'm er hoping to dig them out
B	or they'll be hidden under something
B	if there's a Top Gear on I'd like to watch some of that
A	there's always Top Gear on to be honest
B	yeah but any new Top Gear
A	yeah
B	masterChef?
A	masterChef
B	how is it brilliant?
A	how is it brilliant?
B	yeah
A	I dunno it's just really interesting and er kind of engaging in a weird way
B	you see I like Ready Steady Cook cos it's quick and they don't know what they're gonna have to use
A	yeah that is quite fun actually
B	er
A	Ainsley Harriott
B	I like him
A	he's always er yeah he's quite fun
B	does he ever have holiday?
A	sorry?
B	just wondering if he er he ever has a holiday
B	actually maybe they film more than one episode a day
A	probably yeah
B	what?
A	so Ready Steady Cook there was er maybe they've had to change the format halfway through or something
B	I thought it was half an hour
A	oh okay
B	yeah
A	okay
B	who changes their clothes?
A	so like the presenter
B	ah right
A	and you and you'd probably see um more there's er probably be more than one episode filmed with the same audience
B	okay
A	I think it probably depends on the show
B	I was gonna say Mock the Week they can't do that because it's topical
A	yeah
B	QI annoys me so much
B	how is he thirty?
A	what the one ahead?
B	mm
A	with cool lights
B	do you not recognize those lights?
A	I didn't but now you've said it I do
B	mm
B	that man needs a beating
A	I mean huh it's quite it's it's er it's I was just I was about to say it's quite interesting
B	yes
B	being smug
A	mm
B	did you see the thing about Rowan Atkinson? So you know that er Countryfile presenter filed a law suit against the BBC for age discrimination
A	I was reading about this today
B	and that Rowan Atkinson wrote a letter to some news
A	mm
B	show thing saying that this is disgusting and that it goes against artistic freedom
A	yeah
B	it's like no
A	not sure it does
B	because there's a difference between an employment contract and er
A	yeah
B	she's not a performer
A	yeah
B	so she's not an actor
A	well in all fairness if he was told no you can't do any more films ever because you're too old he wouldn't like it
B	er
A	I think he's just getting a bit
B	no I
A	well
B	this is someone who's done very well out of the industry
A	yeah
B	but it's not really the same industry
A	I I think he's worried about comedy being unable to say things that are offensive
B	no that's not what he was
A	but
B	going on about
A	well er the article I read was er it was was saying that it's  it's part  part of his campaign about you can't have comedy without the right to offend
B	yes
A	so
B	in moderation
A	yeah
B	Rowan Atkinson is a bit of an interesting individual
A	yeah er I
B	this is a guy who totalled a McLaren F1 on dry clear roads
A	yeah
B	as in he's
A	and Prince Charles
B	yes
B	well hang on
A	is he?
B	yes
A	bullingdon?
B	so
A	or is
B	no
A	they're they're not Bullingdon are they?
B	yeah
A	A bit odd
B	I don't understand how he managed to do er
A	fff
B	it costs about two million now
B	Cos er the idea is you sit in the centre
A	right
B	yes
A	on the road
B	and
A	hm
B	yeah I I do just
A	mm
B	fast on a track
A	yeah
B	but no I think he had it for years
A	oh okay
B	but again totalling a car like that that's quite an effort
A	yeah
B	traction
A	so he'd really have to
B	well no you'd have to be driving like a tit
A	yeah
B	which wouldn't be difficult in a car like that
B	sorry?
A	more money than sense
B	yeah
A	as in the people who can afford them really shouldn't be driving
B	in a lot of cases
A	yeah
B	Cos when you've got that money there's a very there's a certain lack of responsibility
A	yeah
B	well you can't really
A	well er yeah maybe
B	I suspect they'll try and repair it
A	but it's not it doesn't mean the same maybe
B	yeah
A	mm
B	that was her job
A	yeah
B	and
A	well yeah
B	in that capacity you are entitled to legal protection against discrimination
A	yeah
B	and er you
A	and it's right that you are
B	yeah
A	I think is the key point
B	and her age didn't compromise her ability to relay information
A	mm
B	to the public
A	yeah
B	um it made her and it didn't necessarily make her you know it it's I mean do you select employee er er presenter on accounts they're attractive to look at? Um you could argue there's a part of that
A	mm
B	but then well I think there's a difference again between selecting someone from a job and getting rid of them
A	yeah
B	from that job
A	yeah
B	well
A	ability to to have people tune in and watch her and convey the information and you know
B	and let's face it who the hell watches Countryfile for the totty?
B	but she did make an interesting point
A	yeah
B	there's lots of er elderly men
A	yeah
B	but on the other hand I think that's a situation that does perhaps need correcting
A	it needs correcting but not postively discriminated against
B	no you
A	people who are capable and have been in the job a long time shouldn't be sacked cos they've over fifty or sixty
B	no this is  this is  probably because she was over forty in all fairness but
A	well
B	uh
A	to be honest I don't know who it was
B	probably why
B	sell the paper
A	yeah
B	however
B	the um
A	no I agree with you that it's it er it's
B	whereas there's lots of men over a certain age
A	yeah
B	um er Paxton
A	yeah
B	Parkinson
A	exactly
B	Jonathan Ross is pushing it a bit
A	he's probably fifty
B	the sooner he starts pushing daisies
B	I do not like that man
A	Jonathan Ross? No
B	I think he's very clever
A	I think he's done good stuff in the past
B	but that doesn't excuse
A	no it doesn't excuse
B	the Russell Brand incident was just on what like Russell Brand I can believe is stupid enough to have thought that was funny
A	yeah
B	Jonathan Ross is er
A	he did the honourable thing and went yeah that was actually really stupid
B	yeah oddly er yes probably because he realized his Hollywood career was just about to set off
A	well
B	um
A	yes
B	however
A	but yeah Jonathan Ross you you can't believe he's quite that stupid
B	no I er er he would've it with him it would've been calculated
A	yeah
B	um
A	he thought it would be funnier
B	no arguably it was very good judgement
A	well
B	as er Jeremy Clarkson will tell you there is no such thing as bad publicity
B	it's not particularly
A	no but I
B	cunning rather than clever
A	I don't er yeah I don't respect that cunning
B	but I think Tim Minchin's attitude is just perfect
A	he's brilliant
B	bend over and raped with your own fist
B	yes
A	the interview with him was really boring though
B	why?
A	well cos cos er he's just not because I think Tim Minchin is is quite a kind of
B	reasonable normal guy
A	a reasonable sensible normal quiet reserved quite private family man
B	despite the feet the make-up the er
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	but when he's performing as Tim Minchin the comedian he does it all
B	so why did we lose the second lane? Jesus
A	seriously? One lane? Oh my goodness
B	well it's light traffic and it's a fifty anyway so it's not gonna make too much difference to progress
A	no no but it's just impressive
B	for fuck's sake
B	get on and widen it already
B	been like this for at least five years
A	nice
B	how it doesn't take that long to build a road
A	hm
B	or at least do it in stages
A	yeah
B	do a
B	thirty
A	hm
B	leaving that aside
B	I don't understand how they weren't arrested
A	yeah
B	well it wouldn't have made wouldn't quite have worked with my grandpa
A	no
B	and the best thing er was there was a lot of evidence cos it went out live
B	oh no it didn't
A	live
B	that was the thing wasn't it
A	that
B	the buck stopped with lots of people I suspect
A	well yeah
B	that would've been the er the the producer of the programme
A	but
B	whoever was in the sound booth at the time
A	oh true
B	though I imagine there wasn't much delay
A	no
B	wow
A	yeah cos they they
B	so people did actually sleep on it?
B	but you'd think Andrew Sachs would've done something about it
A	they left a message on his answerphone
B	that's really annoying
A	yeah
B	dual
A	on this
B	mm
A	I kind of imagine him being a bit like
B	who's
B	oh right
B	yes
B	can I have some water please?
A	yeah
B	slow?
B	yeah we're losing a lane
A	wow
B	that's a vehicle but it's still shutting down
B	go any slower we'd be dead
B	well
A	not quite
A	ah
A	on um Strictly Come Dancing
B	what's that?
A	it's a musical
B	hang on
B	that's
A	that's interesting
B	is that sign right? Surely not
A	yes
B	Christ
A	it is a bit mad
B	fine
B	yeah
A	oh
B	yeah
A	right
B	Cos again we've hit the point of the evening where they're just starting to put them out
A	yeah
B	you didn't text um
A	no I didn't
B	you can't reach
A	I'll stand on a chair
A	I'll sit it on the bench
B	yes
A	stand on the bench
B	slippage
B	lovely
B	maybe she found my gun
B	no it was in the drawer
B	she's got no reason to go through those drawers
A	no no
B	but if she did find it then that's that's her
A	she didn't really look
B	what?
A	maybe she found the gun
B	oh yeah
A	oh dear
B	hm
A	I do wish I'd found out who she was
B	you should have just said who are you and how do you have my number?
A	yeah
B	incidentally has it occurred to you that um I was just wondering whether we're gonna
B	what's FML?
A	fuck my life
B	never heard that
A	have you not heard that before? It's like an internet thing
B	did
B	by any chance?
A	no no
B	it
B	fourteen miles to Darlington
A	yeah
B	yes
A	well I mean
B	it's like for fuck's sake
A	the thing is
B	and a gym
A	I mean the thing is I think they are things he wants to do
B	isn't it a bit creepy? Shouldn't he leave it to his undergraduates? The student
A	well he's he's he's got a  a he's  he's the professional network coordinator
A	do you want number one?
B	er yes please
A	um he he kind of er sends out information to the um the people who were interested as you know so kind of graduates who are interested if you like
B	right
A	so er well no people who are in industry now
B	yeah
A	working as engineers who still wanna be without borders
B	of course
A	um do you wanna turn it on or shall I?
B	mm
B	generally again they spend a lot of time training
A	yeah
B	for things that are never
A	there seems to be a big focus on training and meetings and organization and hierarchy
B	if they
A	yeah
B	who actually do this sort of work properly
A	yeah
B	Cos again the point about Médecins Médecins Sans Frontières is they go into very iffy situations
A	yeah
B	so they they go before the WHO does
A	right
B	they actually go they go in ahead of armed forces in some cases
A	hence the Sans Frontières
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	engineers Without Borders don't
A	no
B	they don't do any  disaster relief work
A	not
B	they might go in six months later
A	yeah
B	yes but the point being that
A	but yeah you can pay er one person to do that
B	no no
A	yeah
B	of course there are engineers in Cameroon
A	no well they pay yeah they pay for their own ticket so they could've donated that money
B	exactly
A	yeah
B	it's just by a slightly more high moral ground
A	yeah
B	um
A	that's that's not why you're doing it
B	that's not the main role
A	but you're open about that
B	but in this situation
A	what by driving around?
B	yeah
A	really quickly
B	there's no  sort I'm not
B	standards et cetera
A	yeah
B	um
A	yeah
B	english students? What?
A	well English
B	oh right
A	students from England
B	and again
A	that would be useless
B	it's fascinating how sort of oh yes Cameroon it's like poverty stricken ain't it
A	mm
B	but that wouldn't be very glamorous would it? Objectively if you went round and er you know a group of engineers
A	hm
B	got and
A	mm
B	which would do a lot more good for a lot less money really
A	hm
B	wouldn't it
B	yeah
A	to do things in exotic
B	it is pretty exotic
A	er
B	Africa is exotic as a location
A	mm
B	but of course it's Africa it's poverty stricken
A	yeah
B	again er this doesn't seem to be working terribly well
A	oh
B	do you wanna take it out and put it in again?
A	yeah
B	ha
A	I know
B	yeah I overcompensated cos I thought it was
B	too quiet
A	so yeah cos it's
A	cool
B	four and three-quarter hours sorry four and one-quarter hours
A	not too bad considering
B	considering the traffic that's pretty good
A	yeah
B	I mean we were stationary for about five or ten minutes
A	yeah
A	yeah um yeah
B	wow
A	wow
B	I'm starting to dislike roadworks
B	well I was expecting those ones
A	oh right
B	so I was fine with it
A	oo
B	but anyway
A	just it's a
B	Jesus
A	oh my goodness me
B	Cos of the perspective thing that it hadn't occurred to me he was that
A	like yeah how close he was
B	what? Uh
A	okay
B	this is er er no this is we're going to Darlington
A	I know we are
B	assume this is too late
A	as in I assume we can just get straight back up again
B	I'd like to think so
A	yeah
B	to be honest I'm surprised the lorry didn't roll over
A	I think if we are we basically on the A66?
B	yes
A	a19
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	as in that comes in somewhere round here doesn't it?
A	I'm not sure to be honest
B	A lot of good you are
A	oh I'm sorry
B	sorry? There's a motorway in a mile
A	no that was really bad
B	surely
A	I don't er get where you were supposed to go
B	I'm sure we've just sort of inadvertently drove past that psychopath and I forgot
A	yeah well er yeah
B	so er this is
A	well er we will come to a roundabout
B	I like unexpected
A	yeah
B	yes I know
A	so yeah so if you wanna go straight over this one anyway
B	well like I said I I assume there'll be
A	we can stay on this road and then join the A19
B	diverted traffic
A	oh right
B	um
A	if we
B	it arguably would be faster to go across to Middlesbrough
A	okay
B	Cos if we're going
A	we
B	so we're gonna go straight on here
A	so and then we're gonna er
B	well
A	different
B	can you well can you look at the route and tell us where the diversion will go?
A	er it depends
B	which should be obvious
A	it it depends yeah it's probably gonna take us straight sort of up and it will just miss that one junction of the motorway
B	so the motorway has come down to a single carriageway road
A	er yeah there was no warning at all about that
B	I didn't plan on seeing Darlington tonight
B	are you confident you can navigate?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	and then the A19 then just goes up to the coast
B	okay
A	so yeah we want
B	I like this part of the country you know
A	yeah so we want the third exit
B	right
A	that yeah
B	of course a tiny proportion of these cars will actually be meaning to
A	yeah
B	so not here
A	not here
B	we'll make our own diversion damn you
A	well that takes them a really odd route for that diversion
B	yeah I think this one'll be quicker
A	take them like back along a little B road
B	yeah yeah
A	um then we come to another one where we wanna go right
B	okay then
A	um but I'll give you a shout when we get closer to that
B	sorry T-function roundabout?
A	well so it's a roundabout but there's only two exits and
B	well I suggest we don't refer to it as a T-junction
A	yeah
B	that's very confusing of you
A	it was nice being in a
B	yeah true
A	we should get a little map torch
B	phone
A	yeah no I'm I'm using it I'm not doing er I'm using my phone but it's just
B	phones are perfect cos they're so low intensity light
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	you're not gonna accidentally shine it in my eyes
A	yeah
B	football stadium
A	yeah yeah yeah yeah
B	are Darlington FC Premier League?
A	no
B	it's a big stadium for a shit team
A	not that big
B	got that
B	what league are Preston?
A	Preston? Oh
B	there's two clubs in Preston?
A	no no as in that that's just what they're called I think
B	okay
A	there might be two clubs
B	yeah
A	cool
B	yeah
A	have to be a home match
B	why?
A	um well if you wanna go and see Sunderland play
A	so that you so you go as a supporter
B	right
A	otherwise it's a bit it's no it's not as much fun
A	er pff
B	okay
A	yeah so the next roundabout we wanna go right instead
B	okay
A	um
B	okay
A	okay
B	you need to provide it
A	I'm hoping that we'll be able to join the A66 at the next junction down
B	er
A	yeah
B	what does that sign say?
A	eastbound closed
B	not er not another
A	so it's taking us that way anyway
B	fucking diversion
B	yeah
A	and
B	so they're going straight on anyway
A	yeah
B	diversion is right
A	so this is yeah
B	yeah
A	maybe for um six miles
B	six miles?
A	yeah
B	okay
A	yeah
B	so the A66 would've taken us to the A6? Is that it?
A	no the er A19
B	okay
B	sh
B	well between nought and twenty there are
B	that's more entertaining
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yes
A	well er they er the you wouldn't the the other roads are just minor roads
B	mental note
B	hm
A	is it is Friday a day when they do roadworks particularly? Or is it just?
B	apparently so
A	yeah
B	again apparently so
A	yeah
B	there was
A	was there? Oh I missed that
B	okay
A	rather than
B	sorry
A	um there's gonna be a junction which um there's a short stretch of A road which then take sort of maybe two miles which takes us to the A66
B	that's probably that road over there
A	mm
B	Durham Tees Valley Airport
A	mm
B	how many airports are there round here?
B	sorry
A	no
B	big compared to Newcastle
B	big compared to smaller than Luton
A	yeah
B	Luton's not very big
A	no? Okay
B	my parents live within five miles of the runway
A	okay
B	so nearly at Middlesbrough?
A	yeah
B	rock on
A	yeah we're coming up to Yarm and Egglescliffe are just sort of er outskirts of Middlesbrough
B	no it's interesting
A	that's true  That's true
B	like expanding my horizons
A	yeah
A	that's really cool
B	not quite sure who it's serving
A	er no I think it looks disused
B	anyway
A	it's the train line to Middlesbrough
B	this would be a lot better if we weren't behind Mr
B	hopalong
A	captain Slow
B	no don't use that
B	this sounds like newer music somehow
A	mm
B	a bit more classic
A	it is yeah
B	yeah
A	well we're not  we're not  far away
B	again long vehicles turning
B	that
A	diverted traffic straight ahead here
B	that that
A	when?
B	on the way to work yesterday
A	I wasn't there
B	yes you were
A	oh him
B	yes
A	oh God yeah
B	I'm just making it up
A	no I thought you meant on your way to work
B	in Cambourne?
A	you do a bit of Cambourne
B	not exactly a busy bit
A	no
B	well not exactly a
B	indeed
A	fewer lorries
B	my back's been remarkably good
A	maybe it was the the s= the sort of late afternoon swim sort of stretched it out
B	oo there's an interesting idea
A	so you could try that as a scientific experiment
B	you
A	to see if that actually helps
B	you'd have to do an awful
B	to get get er meaningful data
A	true
B	how are we going this slowly?
B	if it wasn't dark and unlit I'd be overtaking
A	do you think they're drunk and just being a bit cautious?
B	no I just think they're shit
A	yeah
B	again er
A	hm
B	and it's not just I don't want to drive quickly
B	it's er no it's unacceptable to drive this slowly
A	so it's straight over this one yeah
B	this is quite a long diversion
A	it is
B	what is it with diversions tonight?
B	it seems to be the route of least resistance
A	yeah
A	be sent one way or the other by the diversion
B	if the A19's shut
B	swim
A	yeah
B	turn
A	leave your car
B	diversion
A	yeah
A	oh right we're going through
B	ah yes
A	so he's  so he's  doing forty
B	so the car is speeding
A	yeah
B	yes
A	nice
B	uh
B	to Sunderland
A	yeah
B	oo Tesco's
A	so er yeah
B	for some reason I've got a real er hankering to go to that big Tesco's in
A	ah
B	I bet everything everything would be very cheap up there
A	yeah
B	well there were sort of two lefts so
A	oh sorry
B	not entirely obvious which one
A	well I I I assume that's the one the diversion one
B	oh great
B	we needed a new map
A	we needed a new map
B	again
B	this doesn't look
A	that's a tattoo yeah
B	that's not a good
A	that doesn't sound good
A	wow
B	outskirts of Middlesbrough right?
B	it's not a village
A	well
B	yeah
A	so yeah so now we're heading north through
B	oh that's interesting
A	oh
B	that's either a level crossing or a fire station
A	oh right
B	okay
A	so er straight over
B	oh look logistics centre
A	yeah
B	A K A lorry depot
B	I'm enjoying this
A	it's different ain't it really
B	yeah
A	fair enough
B	Cos most people would be getting stressed in this situation
A	yeah
B	well no we don't know that
A	no no that's true
B	and this way we're seeing more of the country
A	we are  we are  Seeing more of Teeside
B	yes
B	seen at least once so you know to avoid it
A	yeah
A	because
B	yeah
A	Teeside's
B	incidentally um
A	shit
B	yes
B	oxygen supply thing
A	oh my goodness
B	well
A	you know about these things
B	yeah
A	God
B	Cos prior to the operation he was carrying round
A	yeah
B	an oxygen source
A	so I
B	yeah
A	fair enough
B	apparently it was cystic fibrosis or something
A	right
B	but a heart and lung transplant
A	yeah
B	that's impressive
A	yeah
B	I just think it's
A	yeah
B	oh dear
A	okay so when we reach it we're gonna go um gosh it's difficult I'm not sure yeah so we're gonna go over the top of the A66 I think
B	we'll join it
A	and then join it yeah
B	after a very short while
A	yes
B	this er this whole area's quite weird
A	yeah
A	straight over this one
B	and then right here
A	and then this next one is right
B	here?
A	Middlesbrough A66
B	oh wow
A	yeah
B	hell yeah
A	or last
B	it's not open well he's got the top closed
A	oh
B	yeah
A	oh
A	oh okay
B	that's what
A	yeah
B	which I believe you've been in
A	I have been in it
B	with the top down?
A	yeah
A	oh
B	I've never been in that car
A	it's fun
B	yes
A	I did sort of sink down into it
B	that's probably why the roof was up
B	was it?
A	I say stupid o'clock
B	oh right
B	I thought you meant like two A M or something
B	oh so you went to
A	yeah yeah
B	okay
A	and they they brought my stuff to the house later
B	sorry?
A	it was a odd little while living with
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yarm
A	yarm
A	it's got a very famous nightclub in Yarm called Tall Trees
B	what?
A	it's got a very famous nightclub in Yarm called Tall Trees
B	oh you've actually heard of it? Right
A	yarm? Yeah yeah it's yeah
B	wow
A	yeah
B	wow
A	mm
B	which you just don't get in the South
A	right
B	so there's not say a direct link between er St Albans and Hemel and Welwyn
A	right
B	or at least by dual carriageway A road
A	so the roads are all smaller?
B	yeah because it's
A	because
B	assumed you either want to go in or out of London or around London but
A	right
B	not directly between any of the other places
A	that's interesting
B	yeah
A	you just you need those roads
A	no we don't want to go there
B	Good navigation tip
A	sorry
B	er anyway
A	the so Yoda's in the new Vodafone adverts
B	mm
A	my my interpretation of what was happening
B	ah
B	yeah
A	Cos apparently North and South are both this direction
B	not a huge amount
A	true
B	wow that's er
A	and so we wanna go North
B	oh I could use a pizza now actually
B	I'm assuming that's er ah
A	um
B	yes
A	oh yeah have you been on this
B	cool
A	before bit before?
B	no
A	oh no this is really
B	awesome
A	have you not been? Yeah this is really cool
B	sorry
A	that's alright
B	didn't occur to me that was a give way
A	no
B	as in that is a give way line but you need that's a give way line
B	Jesus that was frightening
A	yeah
B	fuck
B	that's appallingly marked
A	yeah that whole spit was just shocking
B	yeah
A	and this is Middlesbrough
B	I have been over this bit before but it was specifically where it
A	yeah
B	which is quite cool
B	you could probably give your parents a ring and tell them we're in Middlesbrough
A	okay
B	how long does it normally take from here?
A	um
B	yes
B	oh great
A	but like he's
B	yeah
A	should I do that? Yeah?
B	yeah yeah
A	can I just turn this off? Do you mind?
B	yeah
A	hello
B	over the raised bit
A	okay then
B	Don't like them overcooked
A	we'll be um yeah maybe slightly less than half an hour
A	no but I was as
B	as in don't tell
A	what you don't like them overcooked?
B	yeah
A	I've said don't put them in straight away
B	but nonetheless can I just say could you
A	okay
B	please relay what I've said
A	sorry I
B	no I'm just speaking for the sake of it
A	okay
B	or at least take not relay it but take it into account and supply
A	I did I
B	that'll be to the centre
A	yeah
B	so we'll make it in twenty minutes or less
A	cool
B	is this er a pizza delivery?
A	sorry?
A	oh right yeah
B	I'm extremely tired
A	nearly back now
B	no this is more difficult when your eyes are this tired
A	okay
B	yeah I want to
A	yeah we'll er
B	yeah I'm very tired
A	so er do you I mean do you think signing up for that LoveFilm thing's worth it? Do you think that'd be a good idea?
B	as soon as we get internet
A	yeah
B	but if we buy one
A	yeah
B	exactly the same thing
A	yeah
B	so we'll only buy stuff that we've watched and really like
A	yeah exactly
B	mm
A	buy them if they're amazing
B	is that that park place
A	um the park place?
B	oh no it's services
A	oh Herrington
B	yeah
A	no no
B	that's not in Sunderland
A	herrington Country Park?
B	no you pillock
A	oh Dalton Park
A	oh no no that's in
B	no it's not
A	oh no
B	I don't believe you sometimes
A	I if I'm  if I'm if I'm  looking at a map and I've found it and then I'd tell you where it was
B	yes but just the fact you fundamentally don't know it's in the same direction as Middlesbrough
A	okay
B	no it's twenty miles five hundred er five hundred yards ago
A	okay
B	no
A	bit more now
B	less one thousand yards
A	how come
B	everything else hasn't been
A	yeah
B	but er fundamentally they're just a better unit to measure speed and distance in
A	okay
A	yeah
B	it is quite useful having both
A	Cos I mean like in a lot of countries they measure it in kilometres I guess
B	yes
A	yeah
B	they're very nice speeds
A	yeah
B	like sixty miles an hour
A	yeah
B	yeah exactly
A	and I think like when we were used to other stuff before they changed it though
B	no but I mean because a mile's bigger I think it's a better unit
A	yeah
B	no it's er the European regulation
A	yeah
B	well
A	oh yeah
B	no you
A	I'm sorry
B	no you don't
A	oh okay
B	which is to twelve point five four mil
A	okay
B	it's
A	that's interesting
B	yeah it's er inches are still in engineering it's still in very common usage
A	interesting
B	incidentally er this was the right choice
A	hm
B	but a diverted randomly diverted and traffic worked
A	mm
B	road worked er A1M would've been
A	yeah
B	isn't it English?
B	who are they?
A	the
B	are they? Oh I always thought they were English
A	how do I you oh no no they're American
B	is Rufus Wainwright English or American?
A	american
B	right
A	okay
B	yes I know
A	yeah
B	I do actually this road layout pretty well
A	I know
B	I'm just not exactly sure coming at it from this perspective
A	yeah
B	oh great
A	he's got a cap on
B	of course he has
A	bad sign
B	that's why we need to get past him
A	mm
B	that song annoys me
A	what?
A	I've Got Soul But I'm Not a Soldier?
B	yeah
B	I don't think any of this song means anything
A	yeah
B	that's why I quite like Nickelback songs actually
A	mm
B	but surely a song should be about something?
A	well exactly
B	even if you're just for each person like
A	mm
B	is meant to be about
A	but
B	random sequence of sounds
A	but is it about the words or is it is
B	yeah but you can't just fill it with random words
A	no no
B	yes
A	so
B	but that they don't try to put
A	okay
B	a song having meaning but in order to sell it they've felt the need to add words
B	that don't make much sense with it
A	okay
B	no it wouldn't
A	but if it's
A	to do with the note that that sound is that that
B	well
A	it's kind of a grey area
B	Peterlee
B	mm
A	what
B	right twelve miles out
A	yep
B	it's gonna have been about four and three-quarter hours
B	well
B	it's been quite a tiring day
A	yeah
B	what are you talking about? You've been sitting there doing fuck all
A	sorry you must be looking forward to crashing out tonight I think
B	yes
A	yeah
B	well I just don't know why there is actually a place in er Tyne and Wear called Pity Me
B	suck me off ville?
B	of course you did
A	ah Hyundai
A	oh
B	I wonder if you could do that?
A	quite difficult
B	I know but birds some birds are quite intelligent
A	yeah but you'd need all of them to be intelligent
B	no you
B	how do you know that?
A	Cos I've just seen which junction we're at
B	I suspect we're less than eight miles out to be honest
A	okay
B	plus it the sign said twelve a mile or so ago
A	okay
B	yeah
A	um on the signs
B	well looking at a map of Sunderland you could argue that
A	mm
A	it depends what you count er um as ever
B	well no
A	mm
B	mm
A	it's definitely not
B	is this the original?
A	yeah
A	oo
B	well
A	hm?
A	yeah yeah
B	yeah
A	and that would of course be simpler because we wouldn't need to mess about going through the middle of Teeside
B	oh yes
A	as in we wouldn't be
A	no
B	funshack
B	funshack
A	it's fun for a shack
B	let's google it
A	yeah
B	yeah yeah
A	are you sure?
B	sure
B	Don't wanna see Sunderland that brightly lit up
B	this road's still fairly quiet
A	yeah it's really pleasant
A	yeah
B	seeing places
A	yeah
B	Cos my major gripe at work really is that I do feel to a certain extent trapped in one location
A	yeah
B	as in
A	but I guess that's
B	yeah I know
B	slightly different mindset
A	mm
B	whereas my gap year just felt like a prison sentence
A	yeah
B	what were you saying?
A	um
B	occasionally
A	which is you know it's kind of a perk
A	that a lot of jobs don't have
A	you know
B	that Sunderland South exit was a long way of so they didn't cos
A	it
B	that was Sunderland North straight on
A	yeah
B	and Sunderland North
A	middle and North
B	that's like Cambridge is with three motorways
B	it's actually Cambridge has kind of got four
A	right
B	so that kind of just leaves three
A	okay
B	actually one of them's not
A	half a mile to our junction
B	actually one of them's not on a motorway so
B	really it is three
A	CB? Odd thing to see on a bus down here
B	up here
A	yay
B	actually now I've remembered now I'll remember that you can see that from this exit
A	yeah
B	make life a lot easier
A	yeah
B	I would've thought this'd be clear of traffic
A	this roundabout?
B	sorry?
A	we were driving past my dentist
B	were we really?
A	just seen it
B	yeah? Fair enough
B	I'm refreshingly surprised that this is a forty
A	yeah
B	Sunderland's
B	fucking bus lanes
A	the this
B	I pay road tax
A	this road is a pain for bus lanes
B	it's not too much of an issue with these conditions
A	oh yeah
B	sorry?
A	there's a shop er a betting shop there called Make That Bet
B	catchy
A	yeah
B	yes
B	I love how
A	yeah
B	what?
A	for the dentist
B	okay
A	and the signs red
B	why?
A	just conjures up the wrong sorts of images
B	sort of boudoir?
A	yeah
B	maybe that's
A	yeah
B	what they're trying to get away from
A	yeah
B	those houses are quite nice
A	they're quite cool
A	no no
B	problem
A	okay
B	and that's a problem
A	do you need to?
B	er
A	do you
B	er yes but I can't really
A	yeah
B	no no that's alright
A	okay
B	I told you my eyes are really tired
B	ah no
A	oh good
B	I know
B	you see I can't help feeling that a roundabout would have made this
B	a lot easier
B	so there's four er roads going across each other
B	roundabout
A	shit
B	it's been thought of
A	yeah
B	possibly
A	yeah
B	I hope it's got toilets on it
A	yeah
B	seeing as buses aren't actually that comfortable as modes of transport
A	yeah
B	that's better
B	uh
A	oh the four's for Doxford Park
B	sorry?
A	the four takes you to Doxford Park
A	so it sort of takes you to work
B	yeah yeah
B	seen the lights
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	I know
B	oh well thank you for pointing it out
A	I just don't like to assume
B	happy Valley
A	yeah
A	it's alright actually
B	been running through there
A	wow
B	well what were you expecting to change?
A	no but
B	yeah
A	ah
B	yeah I've been doing that two-wheeled
A	yeah
B	just make sure we've got the
