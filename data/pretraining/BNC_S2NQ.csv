A	that's totally out of cos
B	mm
A	and said he was erm
B	I
A	she erm she said I can't remember what her name was
B	oh yeah
A	mm
B	about how he was and his temper and
B	thinking he was the big I am and
A	yeah cos at the Olympics he lost his temper didn't he? mm saying
B	did he?
A	yeah saying that cos he got beat by somebody in one race
B	yeah
A	don't know his name cos he won quite a
B	oh right
A	they accused him of cheating
B	oh but he was making big
A	he
B	was beaten was it?
A	cos he was beaten yeah so he sort of kicked off there
B	yeah
A	so yeah it is well
B	yeah
A	well-known he's got a a bit of a
B	yeah
B	oh that's
A	yeah
B	mm
A	no
B	oh yeah I think so
A	I don't really want him to get away with it d'you know what I mean? it happens too much abroad
B	yeah
A	it's like OJ Simpson innit?
B	mm
A	you know
B	that's right
A	that's right yeah
B	although I suppose normal people who are out on bail they carry on with their own jobs don't they?
A	mm
B	if you're out on bail you go to work you carry on
A	yeah
B	yeah there's different
A	daily to the police station so they know you're not
A	yeah so they know you're not
B	what the
A	gonna run from the country and that I think
B	yeah
A	you report report weekly or
B	different restrictions on
A	yeah
B	so in a one way you think no he shouldn't've been going off carrying on doing the competitions but actually that's his job isn't it?
A	mm
B	so
A	until found guilty I suppose
B	yeah
A	he had to have a
B	that's it isn't it? innocent till proven guilty
A	but yeah I I do think he done it really what he was doing well he did do it we know he did do it
B	yeah
A	cos he's
B	yeah
A	admitted that hasn't he?
B	yeah
A	so
B	mm
A	but he thought that's that's the bit I don't get if he thought it was a burglar why didn't he just?
B	well ring the police
A	yeah
B	you'd make sure where your where your your girlfriend was
A	you're standing there with a gun
B	yeah
A	you call the police and you've got them on guard till the police get there and they'll break the door won't they?
B	this is it
A	and arrest them on sight
B	and you
A	yeah they was full of bullets in there
B	yeah
A	he's had a he's had a
B	yeah
A	barney with her and
B	yeah
A	totally lost it
B	mm
A	so you know
B	probably thought he'd just scare her though by doing that rather than actually kill her but
A	mm
B	yeah
A	they're meant to be dropped to manslaughter
B	no
A	he could get away with this I think
B	no I think we'll see today hopefully he'll get some sort of sentence
B	yeah
A	been a long old trial hasn't it? someone's gotta pick up the pay for that as well haven't they?
B	yeah yeah that's true
B	get so many different ones there now
A	yeah
B	it they get used to it incoming and we got erm
A	you got the fat balls out they like that don't they the fat balls?
B	yeah the starlings like the the fat balls they come they come quite regularly erm
A	are they dried mealworms or?
B	they're no they're not mealworms which ones are you looking at?
A	aren't they? oh the one that bird was just having a little
B	oh that's just mixed seed
A	oh is it?
B	yeah
B	normally in the the bottom left one we have either the mealworms or the suet
A	oh yeah I can see now
B	little suet pellet things yeah but that's erm we haven't got any of those so I've just put the normal seed in thinking
A	yeah they do yeah
B	mm it's quite nice cos the window cleaner came
A	yeah I've noticed that's
B	the weekend did all the windows cos
B	and then sometimes cos the the hosepipe's outside the window here put it there for cleaning the fish out so I'll just get it and and spray water and spray water and
B	this and sometimes you hit the the little water thing and it splatters back
B	and it's just the whole window's getting covered in all this this water
A	I've just I've just done
B	yes no brilliant
A	do they go in that letterbox?
B	erm they
A	oh right yeah
B	yeah
B	erm
A	ah
B	on that phone rather than the fax
A	oh right yeah
B	erm on the left
A	there's blue tits
B	mm
A	open
B	mm
A	when they were
B	yeah
A	but the blue tits they used it
B	oh yeah
A	when when I went to get some seeds and that the chap said oh blue tits prefer
B	mm
A	open boxes like that
B	yeah
A	and what they do is actually camouflage
B	yeah
A	I think that's weird that cos you'd think they'd prefer a camouflage it's protection innit?
B	you you can see in the hole they actually erm
A	mm
B	and they're not quite sure if they're trying to make it a bigger hole or whether they're just marking the territory or what they're doing but you can see and they do that while they're actually
A	mm you can see can't you? yeah
B	because we watched them the year they they went in there building the nest and they kept coming and going and
A	ah
B	they call the starlings
A	erm
A	oh right yeah
B	opening and we had robins in there about three years ago
A	oh brilliant
B	and that was before we really put all the food out we now we're putting more food out
A	you're getting all sorts now
B	yeah we had the blackbird last year
A	yeah
B	to go in there
A	those starlings they take everything don't they?
B	yeah
A	oh right
B	and then they started coming and they came here and you're sort of like oh they've moved on to better quarters
A	yeah cos
B	mm
A	I
B	mm
A	what? I didn't hear anything
A	I said well it just sounded like a bang
B	no
A	he went outside to
B	yeah
A	into the garden
B	mm
A	and there was a bird sitting on the patio
B	oh
A	and now it's got his
B	it'd flown into the window
A	patio door
B	yeah
A	yeah it was and that was what the I
B	yeah
A	so he said oh we'll put it out its misery I said no I think it's alright it just
B	probably just a bit stunned
A	bit concussed or shock
B	yeah
A	he said well we can't leave it there because er
B	the cats'll get it
A	yeah or another bird will come along
B	yeah
A	so I sort of poked just to see if it
B	yeah
A	was
B	yeah it was just like
B	yeah
A	and I'm like oh if it's damaged a wing
B	yeah
A	it won't be able to fly so I
B	mm
A	sort of poked it and it sort of
B	yeah
A	as you do when you've just headbutted a window you know
B	yeah
A	put it on the floor
B	yeah
A	in a box where it can sort of see out
B	yeah
A	and then about ten minutes later we watched it and it flew off
B	yeah
A	and I I said to him yeah
B	yeah don't think just
A	cos he was
A	yeah just shock but
B	yeah
A	hell of a bang
B	yeah
A	and that's what it was
B	yeah
A	it it must and I said to him you can on my patio door cos I sometimes get birds do that
B	yeah
A	so I put some like fluorescent sticky butterflies
B	oh yeah yeah yeah
A	transparent they are
B	yeah
A	so I've stuck them
B	yeah
A	and then when they see them they think there's something there and they
B	yeah
A	turn around and go the other way
B	yeah
A	but it stops them headbutting the window
B	we had that at the the last house we were at
A	so he said he would get some but I dunno if he will or not
B	at the last house we were at we had erm I had sort of gold again gold ones that you stick metal gold ones like that
A	mm
B	and you get just stick them on the windows they look quite nice anyway
A	yeah they do yeah
B	but yeah just stop a bit cos even on this one occasionally we've had doves fly into this one cos
A	have you?
B	there's loads of collared doves all round here
A	they're quite heavy birds ain't they really?
B	yeah and then you you get the when they've gone you've got almost like the outline of the bird and the the oil off its feathers it's like doosh
A	which yeah it's like a it's like a cartoon thing
B	yeah
A	cos they're quite heavy really
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	oh yeah we've got
A	I dunno what it were cos I said
B	no
A	to him it got a
B	yeah?
A	green bit here so
B	had it?
A	yeah so
B	was it a small bird then?
A	yeah really about that big
B	oh right
A	very tiny yeah it was on its
B	mm
A	own like but
B	see I I could be all
A	mm
B	well
A	I used to know them years ago but
B	yeah
A	forgot it now
B	no I think it was I think it was his grandad used to be into birds and he sort of learnt them from him I know his dad definitely was
B	yeah
A	but
B	yeah
A	it was probably just a little bit shocked just give it ten minutes
B	oh yeah
A	well I said well stick it in there
B	well that's like like you say you know you headbutt a window and you you're gonna feel a little bit
A	mm
B	yeah
A	he's not gonna be able to fly but
B	mm
A	it was it was alright
B	I I rescued a baby sparrow when I was a kid
B	was going down into town I must've been about ten or something like that
A	oh
B	so I presented it to to my mum and dad er like look I've found this little baby sparrow
B	and I had it inside my jacket and little baby sparrow
A	mm
B	so got a shoebox and put lots of soft stuff in it and then started cos obviously then you couldn't just go on the internet what d'you do when you find a baby sparrow?
B	so then we thought we'll actually may be able to try it and dad said we ought to try and feed it bread with some warm milk and water
A	mm
B	to do that
A	oh no
B	and so obviously something had got it
A	yeah
B	a cat or something
A	oh
B	and mum and dad were saying but at least it had a nice life
B	yeah and I made we had to bury it we buried it in the garden
B	oh it was my bird ruh-ruh-ruh
B	yeah
A	oh dear silly
B	but just funny
A	oh it's oh yeah she does don't she? yeah
B	and she builds all the ant hotel and puts ant hotel on it and the hedgehog tunnel and
A	that's right yeah
B	if you build it they will come
A	yeah cos she has them rocks don't she?
B	yeah
A	that she lifts
B	yeah
A	and puts it down
B	yeah
A	cos they get right under it don't they?
B	yeah
A	mm
B	because
A	cos nature's declining as well innit?
B	yeah it is isn't it?
B	it is and I think you can if you can get kids in and this is why we thought with er you know the the bird food out there cos it's nice yes it's nice for us to watch but actually
A	mm
A	it was yeah
B	so we got the acer tree which is down here and we had a different one erm that you could see through
B	yeah so that's when we thought at least
A	that's right you do yeah
B	and it it's grown really fast but it's never gonna go too big and we just keep keep it about that sort of
A	that's right yeah
B	height and
A	that's just the job innit there?
B	think one of the ones
A	oh I can see it yeah
B	yeah tiny little hole in it and
A	birds yeah
B	but it's so tiny and I think maybe it'd do for a wren or something but we're not likely to get
A	yeah cos I like some of them likes many holes don't they?
B	yeah this is it but I think we're not necessarily gonna get a wren here
A	cos sometimes they build the nest so high up
B	yeah
A	you've gotta watch that the little ones don't fall out
B	mm
A	cos they do
B	mm
A	if the holes are too big
B	yeah
A	quite deeply in them don't they?
B	mm
A	sort of thick and then they get in the middle don't they?
B	yeah
A	so
B	yeah
A	but er yeah
B	yeah
A	it's amazing to watch them how clever they are
B	yeah
A	nature's funny I think it's like the other day when you was on about that spider
A	making that web
B	yeah
A	it's just
B	oh it
A	it is just so clever to watch how it
B	yeah
A	does it
B	oh I know
A	and it's
B	I know
A	so fast innit?
B	yeah yeah
A	from the shape of it
B	mm
A	it is clever to watch
B	yeah and it
A	mm
B	what to do you know? they they just
A	that's right no one teaches them do they?
B	know they just know and erm birds and things emigrate and
A	mm
B	how do they know yeah some of them get up up to Australia
A	that's like
B	mm
A	martens
B	yeah
B	mm
A	just sitting there
B	yeah
A	in the water
B	yeah
A	like a
B	yeah
A	and I was waiting for them to
B	yeah to go
A	fly off
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	so
B	yeah
A	do this V formation
B	yeah that's right yeah
A	and because this year there's thousands of them
B	yeah
A	when they take off it's
B	it's gonna
A	gonna look like a big jet plane
B	yeah
A	that's what they said so thousands of people are camping out there waiting for them to leave
B	well
A	but it could be another few weeks yet because it's still mild
B	yeah but but that needs once it starts getting colder that's when they go
A	we always know when it gets that
B	yeah
A	cos you can sit in
B	yeah
A	my living room you can hear them fly over
B	well we see them they practise here
A	oh now the cold weather's coming
B	erm
A	mm
B	quite a few round there and you see them going and you can see the like the Vs with
A	yeah
B	little gaps and things and they're rah-rah-rah it's
A	it's clever innit though?
B	they're going left a bit
A	because there's so many
B	mm yeah
A	they'll obviously they'll broadcast it and they'll show it on the news when it happens I would've though
B	that's the same yeah
A	there's thousands of them
B	at at the Hull where he's working at the moment he was saying that there's erm
A	yeah
B	he said there were thousands again
A	mm
B	he said they were just and it was like so many he said it was just amazing
A	yeah
B	absolutely amazing
A	I bet
B	mm
A	it's like I've seen them starlings they go on about them being you know they
B	yeah
A	the other ones but they do a formation
B	yes
A	and I've seen that on the telly and that's amazing
B	yeah
A	how they sort of sway back and it goes
B	yes
A	from light to dark
B	yeah
A	and it just looks like a river or
B	yes
A	the sea
B	yeah that's when if they if there's loads of the little ants
A	that's right yeah
B	mm yeah and that's amazing when you see them it's just sort of
A	seem to pinch everything greedy they used to think they are but
B	yeah
A	yeah but they swarm together and it's quite nice to watch
B	mm
A	but when they they're gonna broadcast them geese and that's gonna be amazing for how many there was
B	yeah I'll have to look out
A	it'll just look it'll just look like a you know a big
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	so I'd say that was on the news
B	mm
A	so
B	yeah I'll have to watch out for that
A	yeah they said it could er it could be today tomorrow next
B	no camping there
A	yeah
B	no
A	which it is really innit still so?
B	cos
A	mm
B	and he said he thought he'd heard somewhere that they didn't now because the weather's
A	mm
B	was changing and I said no I'm sure they do
A	no they do yeah
B	yeah
A	it's clever how they know how where to go where to come back innit?
B	mm
A	they've like got their own little satnav haven't they?
B	mm
A	it it is very clever of them though
B	to spawn where they were born
A	mm
B	don't they where they or where they
A	mm yeah no it's just clever nature's clever innit?
B	yeah
C	pardon me
B	I heard you
A	ah she's
B	bless her
A	funny
B	I know
A	oh dear
B	she does make us laugh
A	bless her
B	yeah
A	oh dear
B	that's quite alright
