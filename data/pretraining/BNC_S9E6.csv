A	I don't sit on the computer all day
B	I know but like looking at stuff like vicariously
A	yeah I actually yeah I kind of do spend more time on the computer than I do reading actual books it just gets really fucking annoying like this feeling of just like having all these tabs and just like
B	yeah and you know there's these studies that you can't erm receive or
A	yeah probably
B	even like typing and writing is different

A	yeah
B	I can't like I can't really I can't remember like I don't I really think about
A	yeah
B	and I kind of think yeah
A	I don't know I feel like I actually learn stuff from Wikipedia I don't know what but maybe it's cos I've never learnt anything before so like that's the only thing I've half-learned I don't know oh my god yesterday was so annoying

A	in year two? lol
B	yeah you like dress up as a doctor or whatever but it's like really it's like teaching people to have these ambitions which are not really like
A	yeah
B	and like people who don't have them feel anxious about them it's like
A	I was always obsessed with being famous I like wanna be Shakira
B	but I don't think you really would like cos otherwise you like would've like been like putting I guess you did put yourself on YouTube

B	yeah I think definitely
A	do you know what I mean?
B	yeah
A	really? oh that's so cute
B	for like two days
A	why did she have her pictures did she?

B	like a family party thing and like it's sort of totally fucked like you can say that stuff like to people who like you don't know and whatever but it's really awkward for me and I'm like sitting next to her and she's saying it do you know what I mean?
A	yeah
B	like what are you talking about?
A	yeah you just have to go along with it I guess
B	I know obviously I do yeah
A	yeah
B	it makes you feel weird
A	like some people just have that impulse I guess I think
B	yeah but it's quite yeah
A	everyone's kind of well I used to be like that in primary school
B	yeah everyone says that in primary school they're like
A	yeah but
B	this one time like yeah
A	I yeah but I guess it's
B	it's like constant one-up one-upmanship but like you soon grow out of it
A	yeah
B	or not you know
A	yeah I think she's in her like first year of college now I think right? She was like do you want to go to a twenty-four hour library with me? I was like where? and she was like
B	isn't your library twenty-four hours?
A	no are you fucking
B	it's not bad
A	no the closest I have is
B	all the libraries all the college libraries are twenty-four hours there's like one where you can see it's like on the outside of the like public can see the windows and stuff it's like by the river like when you go over the bridge you can see the library you go over the bridge at like three AM it's just like full
A	lol do you like it a bit more now?
B	no
A	do you hate it a lot more?
B	well I don't really I
A	I remember you told me before you went that you could spend your third year in
B	I could if I wanted to I know people who have done that but I can't
A	why can't you?
B	cos like to be honest I don't want to do that because
A	you just want to finish it there
B	yeah it's better I get better teachers and stuff and more attention
A	yeah I wish I got more attention that's all I want
B	but I don't go you once said that you went to coffee with your teachers and stuff
A	yeah true
B	I don't do that
A	yeah are you jealous?
B	no but like you must get quite a lot of attention cos there are only like sixty people on the course
A	yeah I do get attention yeah yeah but like yeah I don't know
B	have you stayed the night here yet?
A	no but I hang out here all the time even all my friends like yeah she's still nice she like if it wasn't for her I would have like failed last year because I couldn't find the exam hall and like she like came out like the exam had started already and she like ran out and like
B	do you have exams again?
A	yeah
B	man I looked at my papers they're so hard
A	really?
B	it's like what?
A	mm I think you sent me like a question that was like fucked up or something I feel like that must be fun like thinking of like how you're going to like fuck them up this year
B	oh my days like classics paper's fine some of like the like ones there was like a practical criticism question on the English paper poem that had no words it was just punctuation
A	no why? that's funny
B	I know but it's like now write about that for an hour you like clever like smart-arses
A	oh my god you can't do that for an actual exam maybe like a
B	they do that they do that in the exam
A	how like?
B	let's just do the best and that's like totally sort of arbitrary whether the examiner thinks like it's good or not
A	I guess like if they studied something
B	but that's the thing cos people were annoyed cos they didn't study it for it
A	mm
B	it is a kind of like you spend so long like revising and working and they do something
A	yeah you can kind of link anything to anything though I think this year I'm going to have a question which is like just one word everyone gets that for like one of their things so it'll be like chance or something and you just have to go lol yeah well is
B	yeah
A	I was thinking maybe I'll do like an MFA in like actual art but it sounds fucking scary like you have to do like have a portfolio and shit
B	yeah
A	don't know why probably go on Tumblr and like copy and paste shit onto a
B	yeah it's not so easy though
A	do you think so?
B	yeah yeah
A	but it it does sound quite competitive to cos like if you're coming from like
B	well it depends where do you want to do it?
A	somewhere good if it's not somewhere good then I won't do it I don't know like
B	but if you
A	yeah I know I'm just like thinking
B	just like start practising drawing
A	yeah I don't think I could do that shit I don't know
B	quite cool I think it would fun to go to do like art school thing afterwards but
A	yeah
A	I think yeah it is a lot about like technical I don't know
B	but I remember doing I'm like I can
A	yeah yeah I remember that baby you made
B	I still have that
A	really?
B	it's facing the wall in my bedroom
A	lol what happened did you win like a Saatchi prize or something?
B	yeah
A	lol
B	it's on the Saatchi website
A	lol yeah I feel like a lot of people will be doing like MFA
B	I'll just put that in my thing
A	yeah a lot of people who do these like who have these technical skills they like use them for like graphic design to like
B	yeah they go and like work for Pixar and stuff
A	yeah

B	everybody else had it
A	really?

A	so?
B	it's too confusing man

A	yeah I fucking love like going but yeah I love it but then I hate it too
B	there's a good one sort of near or near here it's called the
A	smoking
B	it's nice not that expensive either
A	yeah I feel like a lot of like expensive restaurants are not even that good
B	yeah
A	because they just like they have to use like ingredients which are like kind of expensive like they just throw like truffle oil on everything and shit
B	yeah like like
A	which isn't even real truffle oil it's like probably has like meat
B	that's what they do at like that
A	oh my god have you been there? lol
B	no but
B	and he took her there
A	lol
B	and but she had one of the most embarrassing dinners of her life cos like halfway through he started choking and he just kind of like vomited into his plate
A	what?
A	that is so embarrassing especially with like the clientele there like you never know who is
B	yeah she's like friends with the chef some guy apparently he's called
A	okay
B	and like so he was like sending out all this like really special stuff and the guy just like vomits it up on the plate
A	that's so embarrassing
B	yeah I know I think it was pretty bad
A	so is he speaking to her still?
B	I don't know
A	I hate the way embarrassing stuff affects me so badly but yeah like cos
B	have you been there?
A	no I don't know all those places are kinda like the same
B	yeah
A	like but that's the like whole point I guess
B	the restaurants we went to in Paris were like fancy
A	really? were they good though?
B	like they're not actually they weren't fancy they were just good you know? like there was one really funny one that's like
A	you can't ever like finish everything though
B	what?
A	with French food cos
B	well and also like erm whenever I go with this guy
A	yeah
B	or whatever it's like twenty-eight courses it's like all the food on the whole menu
A	there's a book that you should read it's written by like TJ Clark on like the like the weird
B	I want to I actually I had loads of fun doing that
A	yeah
B	I think like I might message like restaurants in Tokyo but I don't think they all know English
B	they might it's worth trying
A	yeah but like in Tokyo like
B	didn't don't you have do you not have an email anymore for that?
A	no she still she speaks to me so I could just get her again but yeah
B	I have written like the most popular review I write I wrote I wrote the only review that was ever read on that site
A	yeah
B	cos the guy shared it
A	lol but I feel like with like Tokyo those people like would they even know if it's like popular or not? like they won't be able to tell
B	no one knows like that's the thing
A	yeah that's true
A	yeah it's just so dull yeah she keeps like it's sad because like she has no friends and like she keeps like trying to go out and stuff even though I don't have many friends either but
B	she's trying to go out with you
A	yeah and I'm just like I would go out but I just don't want to wear a suit
B	you have to wear a suit
A	to go to the
B	you don't have to
A	you do
A	that's the only other alternative for me
B	well yeah I guess but why why you could say oh well I'm not I don't mind going out with you but I'm not wearing a suit
A	it's not up to her
B	yeah I know but like just go somewhere else instead of like
A	lol it's like everywhere that like is worth going for her is like that but yeah
B	what even Café Rouge?
A	no I didn't mean like that I mean like going out going out
B	oh like clubs
A	yeah that's what I mean yeah I know
A	yeah it's meant to be like I was on like fucking like websites looking for like suits and shit tailored for me so I could like get a real job and shit like I can't believe I was doing that it's such a like
B	yeah
A	freedom for what you wear is important
B	that was one of the fun things about fashion you could
A	oh yeah
B	and it had normal people there too but like you were allowed to go in just like wearing whatever
A	yeah
B	you could like be like in your like ripped jeans and dirty hair
A	yeah lol
B	everyone's like really shocked
A	I'm still at uni man
B	you're nearly done though
A	yeah I know but it's just like ah
B	you do a master's or?
A	I don't know I don't I kinda of want to do it really I think I'm like can't be fagged not doing that
B	why don't you have a gap year?
A	yeah exactly I was speaking to the fucking careers woman like I kinda want to like just take a year out like decide what I want to do kind of thing and she was like no like
B	obviously that's not what you tell a careers woman
A	but like they have no like
B	their job is so you don't have to do that
A	yeah
B	just join that army or something
A	I would actually do that if I could I don't know
B	no they don't honestly everyone knows that
A	yeah even with like creative writing I don't know where is like good in England like
B	there's isn't there isn't in England just don't do it in England
A	that's why I'd be like I was just gonna like do my master's in art history and then just do whatever but I'm so fucking tired of art history
B	what about philosophy man?
A	yeah I was thinking of that too but like
B	I think it's the only really worthwhile postgraduate study in a way
A	yeah
B	if you're not doing it to like I don't know it's like really good stuff you'll like have that forever
A	I really wish I did that before like cos I was like trying to just decide between art history and philosophy I was just like I'm gonna do art history just because of like the image of the
A	but I think you actually need to be clever for philosophy
B	yeah it's really hard that doesn't mean you can't do it
A	I don't know also I don't know where I would do it like
B	even like I don't know
A	there's this cool like school of philosophy called the Kyoto School
B	in Japan?
A	it's like it's like merging like old Buddhist stuff with like modern philosophy it's like during the eighties or nineties or something
B	what?
A	like postgrad-wise you said you went to like a Princeton like
B	what?
A	you went to like this thing where like they were like trying to make you
B	no I just had to meet with my director of studies and she was like so like telling me to do like go to Princeton and stuff

B	I much prefer to stay in a hotel
A	I like how you can like
B	it's funny it's more fun
A	yeah
B	do you know what I mean? like hotels are funny and fun they're weirder
A	I know what you mean but like
A	I like the idea of like imagining that I live somewhere permanently
B	I remember like I stayed in one Airbnb in Mexico City and it was just like the same price it was actually more expensive than a hotel and like so much worse
A	really?
B	so we went to a hotel afterwards and it was was much better
A	cos the apartment I found for Tokyo is like so nice

A	lol ah yeah I bet it must be really cheap there now right? obviously
B	yeah even in Paris because the euro's really weak
A	yeah yeah true
B	it's like used to be one euro twenty for a pound now it's one euro forty

A	oh my god how are you still into Words with Friends?
B	it's fun
A	it is fun yeah
B	so why what do you mean?
A	I don't know
B	erm it's fun to do like when you're waiting for a bus or something
A	yeah that's true
B	you just have to spend a few minutes on each curtain if you get the right two strings you can kind of shimmy it down
A	no this one's faulty
B	yeah you bet? you think so?
A	lol
B	what? oh
A	what the fuck is this seriously?
A	down
B	alright let me try these two maybe this is the down string
A	what the fuck?

B	come on then I think these are the up strings though yeah man they're definitely up now how do you?
A	oh my god
B	why don't you call your friend and like maybe actually I know what's probably happening change of combination
A	who doesn't?
B	I know if anybody's watching from the outside street they're laughing at us
A	I thought you'd be an expert on this though
B	I thought so too man it's not my fault the blind's
A	you can't just pull them I tried
A	you're making it worse
B	wait that's good
A	it's a
B	I feel like I'm sailing
