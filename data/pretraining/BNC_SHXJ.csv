C	and you know what the worst thing was like we were going to go out cos we live on a hill we were like oh shall we use it? he goes oh too dangerous
B	he said it's too dangerous?
A	he just wanted to use it on flat ground and pull something along with it then?
C	yeah that is what he wanted to do just pull us along on it
B	that's essentially all we did because we didn't have that much snow and when we did it would just sort of like
C	oh hell no
B	it was just sort of frozen to ice like really quickly so we couldn't
A	you didn't have that much snow?
B	no it was more like

A	oh nice
C	ah keeper
B	ah that was actually pretty good is it offside though? no no
C	no it wasn't
A	no
B	okay
C	oh you dickhead I thought I'd pass and get sweaty but no it didn't work
A	oh get sweaty
C	yeah
B	at least the keeper's back in the the box
C	well he does fuck all anyway doesn't he?
A	I know cos he's not used to it
C	but he's an athlete still like you don't get fat tubby keepers like you used to get
B	really?
C	yeah
A	could do actually would that not be an advantage if you get a keeper so big he blacks the entire net
C	er
B	then he wouldn't be able to move would he?
C	just tip him over
B	yeah he he just
C	save it
A	tip him over
C	you got to save it mate
C	I've got to make substitutions too late now
A	he says that eight-nine minutes into the game I forgot to make substitutions bastard
C	oh well
C	slide
B	to the left
A	I was gonna say that
B	yeah I'm glad I'm not the only one
C	what am I doing what am I doing?
B	good team work here
C	it really is
B	oh that was good
C	oh
B	oh oh oh
A	oh
C	that came off the post
A	it did come off the post
C	oh I'm so pissed that's such great team play
B	good
C	he is left-footed bless him
B	that was a good shot though
A	what what what's wrong with lefties?
C	nothing he shot it with his right foot it was the foot that he shot it with
B	why are you left-footed?
C	no but I'm left-handed
B	oh okay I didn't know that
A	I take offence to all this right-handed society nonsense
C	I think I must have been born left-handed and then parents switched me over to my right
B	really?
C	I think they said that yeah
B	why did they switch you over?
C	because I don't know
B	I think I don't think you get born left-handed
C	no I think apparently my dominant hand I was when I was like a baby and stuff was my left
B	mm
C	they made me use my right
B	why?
C	not sure
B	oh
A	I don't know it's it's definitely like a nurture thing though I think
B	oh yeah definitely I think it is
A	cos erm like you can train yourself like to use your other hand can't you?
B	yeah like if erm if somebody like I broke my collar bone and I couldn't use my right hand so I had to like try and draw erm write with my left hand I mean like if they let me use a computer cos it was in primary school
C	additional password required
A	mm
C	I asked for more transfer funds they're willing to give me this much money okay I'll accept it
B	that's so much money
C	I asked for five million though so
B	I hate how football they just all of this money is going around and they just take it as if it's like nothing as if it's natural to have like millions and millions of pounds
C	well it's cos they get it well they get it from the advertising because let's face it a lot of people
B	and Fifa have loads of money anyway don't they?
C	Fifa are corrupt as hell though
A	yeah yeah
B	yeah they are
C	yeah they are yeah they are yeah
B	yeah they are yeah
C	yeah they are I think they are actually
B	what's a scout?
C	what?
B	what's a scout
C	they scout
B	is that literally it?
A	they look for talent
B	is that it?
C	yeah
B	well why do they need why do you need to hire an extra person to do that why can't your manager just do that?
C	cos he's busy managing the team
B	well what's he doing? he just sits there and goes in the games
C	no he actually does a lot he signs players he does contracts
B	he signs players oh sorry he sign he signs his name on a piece of paper
C	no he looks for players and like
B	but that's you said that's what the scout does
C	sorry he gets the players and talks to them and negotiates and all that and tries to convince them to come to the club
B	well what about the actual trainer? cos they have a manager and a
C	well I don't know about the trainer in this but the trainer obviously like works on fitness and stuff and manager watches more tactics and actual running of the club
B	eh
A	yeah I think there is
B	there's all just too much money going round
A	like you said like you said there's a lot of money so I guess the manager has to be in charge of all the money
B	yeah see look I've got finance now
B	no because you have owners of the club
C	yeah
B	who have the money
C	who just pump money in
A	they look they'll fund it and then he'll decide where the money gets to come like be spent and stuff and different advertising deals and things
B	okay fairs there are way too many positions though in a football team
A	yeah I know
C	ah there's some positions that are just ridiculous
A	I agree with that but then I'm not going to be like no we should ban football cos it
B	oh no no I'm not saying that I'm just saying that imagine how much money they like if they just got like half the amount of money for like everything not just like how much money they have so that like people who are disadvantaged like half the money across the board
C	yeah yeah
A	what if you put in like prices restrictions for like players and things like that?
B	then no just literally just take off like half the money for everything like how much they get played how much the club earns then everyone would be at the same like it would be the same just less for everyone
C	the same but less
A	but then you'll have er like smaller teams will like struggle because they can't finance their stuff
B	no that's why I'm saying like everything
A	would just get halved
B	everything so that it's like the same it's still the same like in relation
A	well then what's the point in that then?
B	because then what I'm saying is if you get rid of half of that money you could give that money to something that deserves
C	oh Leeds United have
A	what? oh what was that about Leeds United?
C	Leeds United have done something to piss everyone off
A	have they? what have they done?
C	pie tax
A	okay
C	tax on pies
B	what?
C	pies are more expensive at Leeds United than they are anywhere else
A	what what?
C	they put tax on pies
B	just pies?
C	yeah pies yeah
A	so the price of pies at Elland Road
C	yeah
A	is now a lot higher?
C	not a lot probably a little I don't know a significant amount but not a lot
A	this goes against everything of Yorkshire
C	I know
A	A pie
A	and B like trying to save money it's like
C	no
A	you've ruined it
C	he's broken the system
A	yeah no but if you halve like the funding or like the money that all the like clubs got to spend
B	I mean like half that money you could give to charity to do things that need it that's what I'm saying
C	money money
A	I know but I'm just saying like if you half the money that like some of the smaller poorer teams had then they might not be able to run the clubs and things like that
C	money
B	no that's why I'm
A	but you're saying half well then it's still worth the same they can't do as much there
B	that's why I'm saying nothing changes like it's still the same like there's still going to be higher clubs there's still going to be lower clubs so that nobody's disadvantaged more than they already were
A	I know but they have to like pay for like the upkeep of like the stadiums and things like that and all the land and
B	no but that's no because everything is half everything
C	everything's half off for this time only
A	right so you so
B	no but like you know what I mean like it's still in proportion to everything else
A	no no I get what you're saying but for that you'd have to like half the value of everything in the rest of the world cos it'll have like a big knock on
B	no you wouldn't it just in football
A	you would just in football? so if you work in a football
B	so stadium and everyone
A	so if you work in a football organisation you're gonna get pad like a hell of a lot less like literally half than anyone else
B	but that's why I'm saying like
A	so everyone will not work for football so then
C	it's like it's like you don't
B	no no no like the players and things like that
A	so just the players
C	just switch off the
B	just like Fifa I don't mean like people who work at the grounds or whatever cos they get paid nothing anyway
A	okay mm
B	like I mean like in
C	but where do you draw the line?
B	I mean like in actual football what I'm trying to say is
C	where do you draw the line
A	just players players should be paid less money
B	shut up yeah that's what I'm trying to say like they still players get paid millions and millions of pound if they halve that that's still plenty of money for them to live on
C	where do you draw the line? one question
A	how would you? okay no no I I agree with that but like how would you put in like legislation that says that a club can't spend this much money on a player given how like?
C	they have salary caps in erm American football
B	there you go
A	so you want to introduce salary caps in I don't know European football
B	I just think players get literally
A	given given Fifa's
C	but
B	they'd still have millions of pounds they'd still have millions of pounds
C	but
A	given Fifa's corrupt nature do you think this would actually work?
B	oh no it's never gonna happen
A	oh yeah no I agree with you then yeah
C	where do you draw the line? I've work at
B	you don't play
A	she's just saying players
C	I know but I've worked at football grounds I work in football
A	but then people would be less like
B	no that's why I said before you don't it's not just people who work in the grounds like catering
C	I work in football but
B	you're just trying to piss me off shut up
C	where do you draw the line?
B	I make a valid point you know I do just
C	whoa whoa whoa whoa
B	it's alright I'm silencing you
C	you can't silence me I'm unsilencable
A	erm
C	yes
A	right I really need to go to CEX cos it's like twenty to

B	I'm sorry
C	that's not
B	it's not my fault?
C	no it's not your fault

C	it's not his fault it's just the fact that like I've got to clean the house and you've got to hoover this and then you've got
