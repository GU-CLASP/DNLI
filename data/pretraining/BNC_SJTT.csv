A	it's a shame because last week I came in erm and did a couple of people here and we were outside cos it was beautiful weather
B	yeah
A	and freezing
B	yeah
A	it's a bit cold in there
B	even walking to my car is too much
B	um I'm a tennis coach
A	oh yeah?
B	I think just finished since last August so I just  and all that sort of stuff and now coaching full time and doing quite well with it so
A	oh super
B	not doing too bad but it was just kind of it was something I fell into when I came back from France
A	uh huh
B	Cos I lived over there for two years
A	oh really?
B	and I knew
A	uh huh
B	so I went up to he was at
A	is there a
B	so I went over to there and then I just didn't do very well over there like
A	okay
B	in that area so I was struggling a little bit and then he ah he moved down here and asked me to come with him cos they needed a bit of a performance programme for the kids so
A	ah
B	well I mainly do performance
A	aha what's that?
B	like kids trying to make it nationally or professionally or
A	oh right
B	cos I've been in that my whole life as well
A	aha
B	just it's what I've been used to do
A	oh brilliant
B	now she's at university in America
A	to ah she got on a tennis scholarship?
B	scholarship yeah
A	brilliant
B	um Tampa Bay
A	Florida is that?
B	yeah
A	ah nice
B	because of the contacts I had over there she just sort of she asked me she said oh I can't I don't really want to play serious that much
A	uh huh
B	anymore and I'd like to go to uni and I said well you're not going in England I said if you can get it for free in America and she said ah oh ok and I went choose a place that you wanna go and I said I'll call my friends and they'll get you in over there and then she said Florida so
A	blimey who are your friends?
B	I know a lot of people
B	yeah
A	really? Why are you pretty pretty much based in England? Why not go somewhere else?
B	I dunno
A	oh really? Blimey that's good what's that?
B	um my parents well we all  we all  run a pub in
A	uh huh
B	trek here and back every single day
A	where is
B	it's ah do you know the M6 well?
A	no not that well
B	okay erm it's like in the middle from Birmingham and Wolverhampton
A	okay
B	it's up near
A	uh huh
B	so it's in the middle of nowhere so it's a big drive here and back but yeah we run a pub and um my mum imports um jewellery like freshwater pearls and beads from China and sells them
A	uh huh oh wow
B	and my dad's a stand up comic and he still does it now
B	and um I do gigs as well I play guitar and I sing so I go all over the place doing that
A	ah
B	and a just a do as much as I can to survive I suppose
B	no
A	you live by?
B	I live in
A	ah okay
B	so but um it's not great but
A	no it's fine if you can you've obviously managed to get that balance between sport and ah enjoying yourself
B	yeah but um it's alright
A	it's ah what what were you doing in France then?
B	I was coaching tennis
A	okay
B	at one of the biggest academies in the world
A	uh huh
B	it's like one of the top five in the world and I loved it over there
A	right
B	so at the end of the day all my friends left because the job wasn't the greatest and then I kinda was like I love it here but I'm not gonna stay here any longer it's everything kinda went sour
A	oh what a shame
B	um just next to Nice a little town called Sophia Antipolis
A	ah
B	it's like a big business complex and university type place
A	ah yeah
B	yeah
A	aha
B	it's just a massive town like that but it was only about twenty twenty-five minutes away from Nice and twenty minutes from Cannes and
A	aha
B	just a bit further inland but it was brilliant out there and I adored it
B	yeah
A	japanese companies and stuff?
B	you'd like to think they're the CEOs
A	yeah
B	well the thing is who's got
A	because they just seem really sterile and everybody seems like they are behaving themselves too much so what's going on under the surface
B	but the thing is is who who can afford thirty grand just to send their kids to play tennis for a year? They do their school and they play tennis but it's thirty grand and then they got to play extras for tournaments and whatever else the kids are doing but they're all Russian and Serbian and
A	mhm
B	all sorts
A	and what they send their kids to that tennis school for a year or are the parents living there as well?
B	no they just send them there
A	mhm
B	I lived in the dormitories with the kids and had to look after them until they went to sleep
A	mhm
B	I I worked seven days a week
A	yeah
B	which was nonstop ten twelve hours a day
A	like a
B	yeah
A	really?
B	and the summer's intense over there because the amount of kids that they get to go over
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	it's um two months of just you know you're looking after between eighty and a hundred and twenty kids a week
B	you've got maybe maybe eight staff
A	mhm
B	at the place
A	frightening
B	just got hundreds and hundreds of kids just passing in and out and you got eight hour day in thirty-six degree heat
A	blimey
B	and then you got to get back and look after them then look after them on the weekends as well
A	and when do you get days off? Or time off?
B	you don't  you don't
A	is that not against the law?
B	well not for the way that they hired me no
A	really?
B	yeah
A	hey would you like some paid work? Yes alright good was that a nod? Yes ok that's a contract there
B	they they they kinda dodgy in those places as well to be honest with you
A	mm
B	but erm
A	was it like a chain of tennis courts or
B	no if anything they've only just branched out
A	oh yeah?
B	so they got um they're starting to get a bit bigger and stuff but it's only because where they are at the moment it's so expensive that they can't really run what they're doing down there cos they run it from a Mercure hotel
A	mm
B	no it was beautiful
A	mm yep
A	mm nightmare
B	and then just
A	take your eye off them
B	you you with all kinds of work there always ends up being the one kind of person who seems very incompetent at the job
A	aha
B	so I must have almost got him sacked about three times and the boss saved his bacon every time
A	oh no
B	so he didn't like me very much
B	um I've gotten better at it yeah I mean the problem when I first got there was everyone wanted to learn English
A	yes
B	I was in an international academy and I was one of the only coaches who knew English the rest of them were very bad disjointed English so I kinda taught everybody English and for the first six months or something didn't learn any of it myself
A	aha
B	some of them where the funniest part about it actually was most of my kids were like
A	mhm
B	so I had a bunch of six year olds who only spoke French
B	and they did that when I first got there so that was a difficult summer but it helped me out I mean having to learn the language that way is
A	yeah good motivator
B	yeah
A	I did that I was erm I had a class the
B	yeah
A	you can express annoyance in international language
B	but the thing is body language  body language is  beautiful cos it works in any language
A	yep
B	but erm yeah no I mean just I fell into tennis just because and I've been doing it ever since
A	was that eh was that something your parents suggest you should do or was it something you wanted to do?
B	no It was  it was  quite strange I was a  I was a  cricket player when I was younger
A	yeah
B	but I got a strange
A	mhm
B	but we're Ozzies so he didn't really like football
B	so he kinda shepherded me round that and got me into tennis and you know I I I played from I was thirteen until I was fifteen just a couple of times a week and stuff
A	oh yeah?
B	learning from home cos I did that in Australia anyway
A	oh right
B	and erm I I did that from home so I trained eight hours a day got home and did my school work
A	yep
B	myself
A	oh right
B	it was distance education from Australia again because umm when I was living in Australia I lived on a bus
A	uh-uh
B	in Australia?
A	yep
B	because of my parents are Australian my whole family is Australian
A	oh right
B	and I lived there till I was ten
A	did you?
B	mhm
A	where you born in Britain?
B	no
A	ah
B	I was born in
A	aha
B	but all my other relatives are all Australian
A	aha
B	I've got both
A	aha
B	I've got dual citizenship
A	right
B	both passports
B	I don't know  I don't know  I don't know if I've ever really felt at home in either place to be honest with you
A	mm yeah when you live between two places it's always
B	it's difficult because I grew up as an Ozzie I do  I do  feel Australian but I've lived a lot of my time here as well
B	um my parents still lived here
A	ah
B	and when I  when I  quit my job in France I was I just needed to some stability again
A	mm
B	why did they move over?
A	yep
B	we moved over here in 2000 cos of my dad's job because of comedy
A	ah
B	he wanted a different avenue to pursue
A	so he went  he went  down the moving countries route and we moved over here
B	mm mm
A	and that went really well and then we moved to
A	ah
B	worst decision of our lives
B	because there was a
A	ah okay
B	there was a tennis centre there and we were travelling from
A	really?
B	dirty
A	really?
B	it's just it's not a great place
A	what is it?
B	it's like a bead shop brassiere type thing
B	it's still got the beer and everything in it but because of my mum's beads and pearls she needs wall to wall in that now
A	aha
B	all the women who come there love it and the guys don't mind getting dragged along because they can have a pint
B	so it's ah it's a good little  good little  one that one
A	does your mum actually make up the necklaces and bracelets as well or?
B	no we sell them wholesale
A	ah okay
B	we sell erm wholesale and people who either have small businesses or run shops of their own where they sell the made up stuff buy off us so
A	sounds like fun
B	well it's not fun but it's something my a lot of my family's into
A	yeah?
B	my uncle in Australia and my cousin in America
A	blimey
B	kind of all over the place but the majority of them are in
A	oh yeah?
B	the majority of the family live in
A	aha
B	so we're from out that way but there's some one of my mum's brothers lives up in
A	mhm
B	it's nice
A	yeah lovely place
B	aw it's beautiful
A	but went to
B	Sydney bores me it's like any other city in the entire world and
A	really?
B	just doesn't  just doesn't  do it for me
A	mm
B	it wasn't like they'd tried to build new buildings and tried to cram up the place it was just
A	true but I guess it's got more history hasn't it?
B	yeah
A	it's cos the old quarter in Nice dates from quite a long time ago doesn't it?
B	yeah
A	mm
B	the promenade down there was beautiful
A	mm
B	ah but no I'd with me I'd never know
B	I'm twenty-one
A	are you?
B	yeah
B	no I have no I never have plans
A	no?
B	no but the one plan I had in my head is that I would like to buy a place in South France one day
A	oh sounds like a good plan
B	but I would need so much money to do that
A	I think you might
B	win the lottery
A	uh-uh
B	they're meant to be starting up a new Club Med tennis academy there
A	oh right
B	in 2013 or something and
A	isn't Club Med the kind of  kind of  a holiday you go on if you want to get drunk all the time?
B	no I don't know if no it's it it depends
A	mm
B	it's intense
A	mm
B	if you can live your life like that you'd be alright
A	yes definitely
B	well you got to think realistically
A	mm
B	erm the people who who've moved over there in and have the money to spend on stuff like that
A	yep
B	it's all in China these days
A	really?
B	oh all over there
A	mm
B	I went over there for like a week
A	mhm
B	that was strange
A	working or holidaying?
B	kind of yeah
A	oh to find the beads
B	yeah
B	but that was like six years ago was the last time I went to Australia
A	uh-uh
B	Don't get the chance
A	it is
B	I don't know it's not just that it's
A	have I got a spare couple of thousand in a month? No
B	it's not just  it's not just  that you know it's also the the fact that if you go to Australia with the jet lag and all that lot you don't want to be going there for a week or two weeks you want to be going for a month
A	definitely
B	or six weeks or something and then to get that time off work is almost impossible these days
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	it just knocks you out cos it's it's like ten hours in front
A	yeah
B	I'm alright with that cos I just sleep as soon as the plane turns its engine on gone
A	oh no no I was uh on I was travelling alone so I was had to sit next to other people who were travelling alone and I was sitting next to this huge fat smelly guy
B	yeah
A	and uh he ate really loudly and he kinda just took up so much place I was couldn't really relax on the way over
B	I sat I solve all those problems I always get the window seat and I take an iPod with me
B	I normally put a jacket over my face or something so nobody can touch me
A	well a friend recommended that I take a piece of string and just sit there with a piece of string
B	and the the the especially like the short transit flights are it's a joke
B	it doesn't matter if it's a two hour flight like I'll get on and go fall asleep and then boom oh well look I'm here
A	you're lucky
B	I remember the amount of flights I've caught from here and France and back no luggage whatsoever
B	being a tennis coach just walked on with a tennis racket sat down gone to sleep woken back up got off the plane and gone to work
B	I don't know whether it was a good thing or not
A	they go over to you?
B	yeah yeah they came and visit me quite a lot I mean it was a good little trip for them you know
A	I might be going to Nice at some point in the future I've got a a friend well I was friends with a family a Russian family when I was living in Barcelona I was teaching them English
B	yeah?
A	and erm they were from Uzbekistan And they'd moved away from Russia because they didn't he had a building construction industry uh company and he didn't want to be involved in all the corruption and scamming and that was going on
B	with the mafia
A	erm they moved to Barcelona to France erm Aix-En-Provence?
B	mm
A	and erm three years later he found his wife had been blown up in their car and she obviously died erm and then the next day he was put in prison for it
B	was that French police or?
A	french police yeah
B	the French police are are quite strange the way they go about things because they're very laid back about everything
A	yeah yeah
B	it's either nothing or everything
A	yeah yeah yeah they are
B	yeah
A	and one of the drunken American guys decided it would be a good idea to pull a moonie at them and so he just
B	no they're just waiting for something
A	yeah
B	you can't help people when they start to drink
A	that's it
B	yeah
A	stuff like that cause like in some areas like that the police don't go there cause it's such an established community
B	no
A	really?
B	I mean we had a swimming pool like exactly next to our complex and we used to go swimming in that three o'clock in the morning
A	mm
B	but um just it was it wasn't too bad it was not like they don't enforce anything but I think I only ever annoyed them once
A	mm what did you do?
B	I was playing like Playstation games at like two in the morning and I had my balcony window open and shouting and screaming as you do and they just come up and started going mental to me cos I was waking up the entire
A	oops
B	campus
A	and you were shouting at your?
B	yeah my friend
A	so what's your work schedule like here?
B	I work six days a week
A	yeah?
B	I have a Tuesday off which is possibly the worst day in the world to have off cos you can do nothing on a Tuesday but no I work six days a week and I'll be in for like twelve hours every day
A	really? That's a lot of work
B	I'm not working that much I'm just here
A	no?
B	but the problem is cos I live so far away I can't go home I can't  I can't  really do anything I just have to sort of suck it up and try and get myself more work every time I'm down here
A	mm
B	no
A	and how do you go about that?
B	talk to people
A	uh huh
B	yeah
A	right
B	and I so I work all those groups and you can pick a few lessons out of groups and do other stuff so it's okay that way as well
A	mhm
B	but erm it's not bad
A	yes it's not fantastic for work round here is it?
B	I mean I'll never
A	no
B	no I mean
A	consider going other places
B	no I mean I'm just I'm I'm seeing what with my other businesses and stuff I'm seeing how that pans out really
A	mm
B	and get
B	oh Florida I could go there for a couple of years see my sister and work over there it'd be mental over there
A	that would be cool
B	and Dubai I wouldn't mind visiting there for a bit
A	oh yeah
B	not to to sure I'm keen on their laws
B	yeah
A	really?
B	it's killing the country as well over there
A	mm
B	um American university is strange
A	yeah?
B	they study like everything
A	really?
B	yeah
A	oh really?
B	so she's there for four years and for the first two years you know you study everything
A	mhm
B	she wants to do fashion design
A	okay
B	Don't ask me why but she wants to do it
A	okay
B	because she
A	mhm
B	Cos of tennis
A	oh right and will she do that in America do you think? Will she be allowed to?
B	yeah yeah
A	hey
B	she'll move she'll
A	oh yeah yep
B	she's got the highest GPA out of any athlete in her school
A	oh fantastic
B	so I think she got something ridiculous like a five point two which I think is the highest you can get
B	feel quite proud of her for that to be honest with you
A	what's she studying at the moment then? All the?
B	uh she's doing mathematics and psychology English history
A	and is she enjoying the the culture?
B	yeah she seems to be enjoying
A	yeah
B	study train and compete
A	mm
B	I just went well from one  from one  like extreme to the other just absolutely went off
A	really?
B	oh it was bad
A	you've not been deported that's a good sign
B	yeah
B	erm but uh no it was  it was  but uh I got  I got  myself back and uh I just knew I could never go to school I know I never enjoyed it
A	mm
B	never enjoyed studying
A	I don't enjoy studying either no
B	for me I enjoy working
A	mm
B	Seven days a week just kills me but even the one day off a week yesterday just didn't know what to do with myself just pacing up and down the house cause it was raining outside and I had nothing to do
A	oh
B	I just it drives me insane
A	aww
B	I'll be like
A	that's very nice
B	erm I've got a lesson at three a private individual lesson at four another individual then I've got a group of red kids which is like five to eight year olds
A	mhm
B	means I have to stand around and tell people what court to go and play each other on
B	yeah I was singing in that
A	you were singing?
B	yeah
B	they've realised I'm like a very cheap alternative to anybody else that they can find
B	we work out things for
A	and how did that go? How was the dinner-dance?
B	so
A	mm
B	everyone else seemed to like it
B	no no I wasn't playing guitar
A	oh right
B	it was just to like backing tracks and stuff just
A	mhm
B	Cos unfortunately I can't find anybody in this area who can play instruments to make a band
A	oh no
B	but um I got an agent at the moment he keeps getting me gigs all round the country
A	oh really?
B	yeah
A	what playing to backing tracks or?
B	no playing like guitar
A	and what kind of stuff do you play when you play your guitar?
B	everything
A	mhm
B	just about everything and anything
B	always had a memory that's it just remembers music more than anything
A	mhm?
B	my dad a comedian so it's just entertainment my whole life
B	all over the country still
A	yeah?
B	I mean he could be on telly and doing a lot of that sort of stuff but he doesn't want to
A	really?
B	on the  on the  circuit
A	what kind of sense of humour has he got?
B	erm
A	uh-uh
B	he's had to change it a lot because a lot of it applied to Australia
A	uh-uh
B	I think  I think  he might refer to himself as an anarchist
B	um comedy's changed over the last decade
A	has he been
B	yeah I mean he was doing it all along anyway really
A	mhm
B	but he hates it these days he only does it for the money
A	aww
B	he used to
A	aha
B	he used to headline the equivalent in Australia He was huge
A	mhm
B	seriously
A	and when he gets home from work is he really serious
B	ah he doesn't crack jokes but he's not really serious he's just a he's a business man dad is
A	mhm
B	just unfortunately he's not a very good investor
A	ah
B	it's not a bad philosophy but I mean he's been a millionaire twice in his life the unfortunate part is he's been broke three times
A	oh no
B	mhm
A	oh wow
B	he was huge
A	uh-uh
B	videos CDs the lot
A	but did he enjoy his millions that's the important question?
B	I've no idea cos it wasn't while I was around
A	aww
B	I missed that part
A	shame
B	I mean when I was younger we were quite well off  when I was younger we were quite well off  but one of the reasons we moved to England was we lost everything over there
A	really?
B	yeah
A	mm
B	nah
A	ah
B	can't trust them
A	as far as you can throw them
B	yeah he's he's got a couple of agents over here but he just he doesn't do it that big and he doesn't want to go that big anymore he just  he just  sort of mills along these days
A	hmm
B	but I mean both my parents just don't know how to relax
A	really? Oh what a shame
B	yeah like seven seven days a week just as much as they can working
A	then again Mr who says he works six days a week and then uh
B	I think uh  I think  I got that from my parents to be honest with you
B	wish I'd parents who knew how to relax a little bit
A	aww
B	yeah
A	mm
B	yep
A	no oh
B	I run around the court all day and
A	true
B	but the things is I'm not as fit as I used to be so
A	hmm
B	get's me down a little bit but then again I'm just too lazy to get myself in the gym
A	get one of the personal trainers on your case
B	I'll teach you how to play tennis if you get me fit again
B	uh started at quarter to nine this morning
A	in the morning?
B	and I finish at ten
A	oh my life
B	then it takes me an hour to get home so I'll be back at eleven
A	God And uh but have you got did you have like a lesson early this morning or something?
B	I had a lesson at quarter to nine and then uh a lesson at ten and then nothing till two then this and then I'm on court three till ten now
A	blimey
B	and that's a solid seven hours on court
A	that is solid isn't it? Do you is there anywhere you can take a nap round here?
B	not really
A	aww
B	it serves alright sometimes
A	aha
B	so when I was driving that around I used to just whenever I had a couple of hours off I'd jump in the back of that fall asleep and wake up again and go back to work
A	it's a good idea
B	nothing
A	and don't you like go in the spa or go for a swim?
B	no
B	I just go and sit down somewhere
A	you go and sit down somewhere
B	I go and sit down somewhere and do some work doing something
A	and do they feed you here?
B	no
A	you have to bring your own stuff? Do you get a discount?
B	uh very minimal
A	yeah?
B	fifteen per cent or something
A	that's a shame
B	with these prices it's not even worth it
A	yeah true
B	hey if it was sunny outside I would've been outside sunbathing that's what I would have been doing
A	mm well
B	the weather has just decided to give it one again
A	what a shame eh? Last week it was gorgeous I got sunburn sitting out there for forty-five minutes
B	yeah
A	oh is it? Yeah just now that the weather's getting crappy
B	it's meant to open first of April but uh I don't know what's going on with it
A	it does
B	I've no idea why
A	yep
B	I think so
A	sometimes you have got a Brummie twang
B	I've been told  I've been told  that like that like I sound like like I'm from the West Country at one point
A	it's true yeah sometimes
B	it's just such a strange accent
A	and uh I thought maybe there was
B	there probably is I pick up  I pick up  things without knowing it
A	yeah having a musical ear is that's very
B	makes me sound like a mongrel in my accent
B	yeah
A	so I'll let you go
