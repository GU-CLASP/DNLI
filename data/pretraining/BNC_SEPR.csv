B	mm
D	doesn't make sense the email I read
B	no it doesn't
B	it's crazy just send a new one

B	you should have said that the cover had broke as well
C	I did well I said I haven't got the cover and they said well you can't have a new knife
B	well you should have said it had broken
C	so then I said I well it doesn't matter they even if
B	well yeah but if surely if they're sending you a new knife because the knife's broken they'd send you a new cover if the cover was broken as well
C	no but no they no they wanted something returning
D	something
C	yeah
A	return them another knife then
D	the old knife
C	they're sending me the cover anyway so they're not fussed
B	mm
C	about whether the cover's broken they just wanted something returning and apparently on the back of the sales
B	yeah

B	you need to send the
C	you need to send
A	to send back
B	yeah a part of the product has to go back
B	for goodness
C	a
B	off the dish?
C	yeah I think
B	oh you're not
D	part of the
C	no I think no that that that's what they're saying you have to do
C	and they are saying that is written on the erm on the back of the
B	oh how stupid
C	I
C	they're sending me one through the post but you wouldn't put
D	you wouldn't yeah
C	a broken knife in the post would you? that would be
B	why don't you just put the handle?
C	well that had er that had the blade on it as well cos it
B	well
D	it's the same you might as well send it all
C	it severed through the
D	anyway
C	crossways through it
B	yeah but it only had a little bit of a blade on it didn't it? it's not like it's massive
C	well even so it's still a still a blade that's
B	yeah well you can wrap it in bubble wrap couldn't you dad? do something like that
C	they didn't want it they didn't they wanted the the plastic
C	they were quite
D	they're obviously short on covers
C	they were quite
C	they were quite insistent
B	well they're sending her one back out so they can't
D	brand new
B	anyway you'll have another like a cover now
C	I
A	and so will you
C	send that in the post like that

D	yes
C	the cover you can have a brand new cover
D	you can have the we don't we don't need a cover
B	I'd
C	let's hope it fits
B	well I don't think it will be the brand new cover I think it'll be
C	do you think?
B	well what about if they send you a brand new knife? what about if the knife isn't even the same and the cover's different? well you you haven't thought about that have you?
D	have to deal with that
C	well you can
D	cross that bridge when we come to it

C	well but it's
B	what's chopping then?
C	she well she was making a big thing though she she she was doing this she said for ages cos I used to sign like this people said well why are you holding this end of the cucumber when you're chopping a you don't chop the end that you've chopped off do you?
A	no
C	you hold the end and you chop towards it
A	yeah
C	so she says bear that in mind she says and they'll they'll mark you don't in the exam if you're doing the cucumber chopping that way
C	cos why would you be holding there?
B	but you can argue I chop a cucumber the other way
C	well you just have the cucumber bouncing around wouldn't you?
C	if you you're holding the end that you've chopped off
C	yeah
A	oh
C	yeah what else did she teach us? that she she said she she she learnt this
C	at the Christmas meal
A	grate? grating?
C	no she thought it was something rude she was really excited she she was with a group of deaf people and they're having their Christmas meal
B	oh right

B	oh okay
C	and it serves six and I've got the exact quantities for that so
B	yeah okay
C	that wasn't too then obviously you've got your vegetables on top but it wasn't a very
B	vegetables are nothing are they?
C	no it wasn't a very calorific meal
B	excellent
C	obviously I have not factored in the wine I shall be drinking with mine
C	so have you told
B	I sent him the I screenshotted the text and said erm oh well look at this and he said why has

C	well she she won't even have asked if she's on
B	oh no
C	she won't get a card she won't get anything
B	no
C	well that's that's disgusting considering it's
B	yeah
C	it's
C	she doesn't bother for Christmas or anything does she with you?
B	erm
C	or does she?
B	she did for him this year what did she get him?
C	oh yeah but does she with you and
B	erm
C	oh well she should it's good if she does but I'm just wondering why you think if that's the case she won't bother with his christening
B	well because she didn't with our wedding she didn't get us anything
C	oh
B	almost as if
C	oh
B	she was just on
C	that's bad isn't it?
B	she's rolling in it
C	mm
B	she's got so much money
C	well yeah it wouldn't hurt to do that especially your own brother getting married as well
B	yeah
C	oh dear
B	well she erm
C	yeah
B	a manager so she she put everything away yes she'd had a few nice cars but they were kind of on finance and she'd never
C	oh that's right
B	gonna pay her the amount
C	that's right yeah I remember that
B	and I remember
C	that's right I remember telling
B	what?
C	yeah yeah
B	what on her two bed flat in
C	mm
B	it's gonna be what? like five hundred quid how do
C	yeah it's crazy
B	that's so stupid
C	and she'd been living at home all that time where's all her money?
B	where's all her money? I think I mean even though you know me and
C	what you know mummy here would fork out?
B	at the drop of a hat
B	but if you know obviously we've got him but that is the last thing that I'd ever want to have to happen
C	yeah
B	you have to pay our mortgage for me I mean
C	yeah
B	you have to pay anything
C	I'd own the house then one mortgage payment would entitle me to that you know that don't you?
B	I mean it's just it's one of those things isn't it? you
C	mm
B	I mean having taken that loan off nan for a start I mean
C	mm
B	I offered I mean as soon as we I said right we'll set up a direct debit
C	but you're not paying any of that back at the moment are you?
B	no no no she doesn't want it
C	she said that yeah
B	I have offered numerous times
C	but hopefully when you move house it can be included
B	yeah
B	yeah
C	that will be a good thing
B	yeah no I definitely don't want that but I don't think she'll ever ask for the full amount back
C	oh don't you think?
B	no
C	I know but then well she probably wouldn't do it for
C	what about the boys as well?
B	don't know
C	cos they all know don't they?
B	yeah I don't know
B	I'm
C	oh maybe she doesn't know
B	I haven't told her but erm that I
C	mm
B	I just don't think like of course I'd I'd pay all of it back but I don't think she'll want all of it back she might maybe happens that we move house and we're able to pay back I don't know five of it or something
C	yeah
B	I reckon I dunno by the time I get to about ten I think she'll probably say call it quits
C	do you think?
B	yeah
C	lucky you
B	I know
C	they'd never do that with me
C	she lent us money
B	eh?
C	she lent us money
B	yeah
C	they did to pay off your dad's credit card and stuff like that
B	yeah yeah
C	but I always paid it back
B	yeah
C	mind you they lent
B	mm
C	so
B	I couldn't I
B	but erm but yeah that's just something that I've said that to
C	yeah
B	she had no dependency she was
C	yeah
B	she had this nice car she's got a nice flat and she had to get
C	crazy
B	it doesn't make any sense
C	no it doesn't
B	and er yeah I mean of course I'd it's the thought and I'd much rather I spend some time with them than buying any sort of you know gift but erm it's the fact that she does neither it's just a much more
C	oh I know does
B	he loves M and M's
C	peanut M and M's
B	mm
C	you don't?
B	no
C	I saw a peanut M and M egg you see
B	I've got him a peanut M and M egg
C	oh you
B	you can get him another one if you want
C	I'd no I
B	yeah yeah
C	and we walked past them in Asda today
B	I've got him one it's in my car mm
C	er?
B	I got him one it's in my car
C	oh see
B	I was trying to hide it but then he went to get the pram out the boot the other day and he said oh er you've got me an Easter egg then? and I went oh yeah
C	oh he's oh you could have left it here erm cos I wouldn't touch a peanut M and M egg either
B	yeah no exactly that's why I've got it
C	anyway I just saw it I thought oh peanut M and M I said to
B	or a mint Aero
C	I know you'd
B	yeah
C	I didn't see a mint Aero one
B	or
C	what Creme Egg Wispa all those?
B	yeah don't get one of those
C	okay but Maltesers are different
C	and
B	I know yeah
C	Galaxy?
B	I suppose actually I'd have a go at any
C	yeah of course you would
B	you know?
C	especially like me and especially if you're dieting
B	yeah
C	it's even more reason to scoff an egg
B	I know I just don't want him to have too many cos by the end of Easter to now we'll have all of it gone
C	right so a little a little egg then?
C	no no
B	don't bother I might give
C	well he's
B	give him his now just so he can
C	start it
B	yeah
C	it's only
B	cos he takes ages to get it
C	I've spent a lot of
B	more obviously
C	the present's really for six months plus but it'll be alright you know the shapes sort of thing
B	oh okay
C	probably leave it round here
B	yeah
C	so you've got to be sitting up a bit
B	yes moving on to bigger and better things
C	and he's good at football
B	he was sitting earlier obviously not by himself but he was sitting quite well
C	did you have to take that
B	the Bumbo?
C	back?
B	no not yet
C	next week and you get it for two weeks do you?
B	yeah
C	has he sat in it much?
B	yeah sat in it a few times
C	yeah
B	it's difficult because we're out a lot in the day and then in the evening it's like oh he's too tired
C	bit tired yeah cos you've gotta he's gotta hold himself up properly hasn't he?
B	mm I'm looking at getting a like a bouncer like I know it sounds stupid because the one we've got is really nice and it looks really nice
C	who was that off?
C	oh right
B	erm but it's just like you put him in it and he even I'm thinking even when he is six months even when he is a bit bigger he he's like it's not he's not strapped in so we won't be able to
C	yeah
B	bounce around and he's gonna be doing this
C	yeah yeah yeah have you
B	so I want one
C	so have you seen just the very simple?
B	yeah that's what I want
C	yeah a simple
B	and we've there's one from Amazon from for for about twenty-five quid
C	oh as much as that?
B	and it's the same that I had I think when I was little and it's like the bar across and then you've got the two things that comes out and
C	that's right yeah yeah
B	one of them
C	that's it and you just er
B	I'm thinking of getting one of them
C	strapped in like a big nappy type of thing
B	yeah about twenty-five so I thought well
C	yeah
B	it's not that much so erm yeah I think I'll get him one of them
C	yeah cos they do all these fango-dango super-duper ones but
B	yeah which I think you could probably
C	all you wanna do is bounce in them
B	yeah yeah yeah which to be honest if I would have bought him one myself I would have gone for one like that but
C	mm
B	because it's a present and he does
C	yeah
B	yeah he does like it but
C	yeah
B	and I mean and he will like it a bit more as he as he gets older
C	yes
B	and he can use it properly
C	yes
B	but it's just erm it's an effort as well whereas with that one he can you know he at least he's strapped in and of course you're
C	mm
B	yeah it's kind of just a bit erm he's all over the place he's just wibbling and wobbling you know obviously now but erm
B	oh okay
C	she'll have to show you in a bit it's only a little hers is a little thing where it is but it is very cute
B	mm
C	had loads of stuff
B	where did you go?
C	sausage dog
C	yeah a pull-along sausage dog by the Fisher Price or Little Tikes or something
B	did you go to Mothercare? was it Mothercare?
C	no we were in Boots and then Asda
B	oh okay
C	erm but the pull-along dog was good but you he's a pull-along erm but he's got notes all the way along him
B	really?
C	and he and it's the
C	then he does other songs at the end
B	oh okay
C	and he can hit all the
B	he's about to go
C	like a xylophone thing all along him
B	yes
C	and they'd got the things you hit with the hammers you used to like that one the
B	yeah yeah yeah
C	but they were you've gotta be bigger you've gotta be twelve months really for those
B	yeah bigger for those yeah
C	you've gotta be yeah and these these were
B	to appreciate those
C	erm this this one he won't do this either but when he's sitting up a bit he might be able to have a go
B	yeah yeah hello
C	and we'll see
B	it's gonna come round anyway
C	well that's right yeah
B	mm
C	no good wishing the time away is it
B	no
C	enjoy this bit
B	yes
C	especially this bit

B	he was just like
C	yeah
B	he had his one arm squashed he was like this with the other arm
B	on my chest
C	ah
B	and erm yeah he was just fast asleep with his legs across me like that

C	yeah
B	long sleeved vest just lying on me
C	ah
B	oh this is nice
C	yeah
B	just some time when we're not
B	moaning or

B	I know
C	mum get off get off get off

B	I will enjoy it when you can tell me what's wrong though
C	he'll would just screaming and shouting at you once he can
B	yeah
B	yeah
C	no he won't he'll be far better behaved than that
B	mm

C	sign language then

C	yeah
C	yeah
B	but no there wasn't another table close free
C	yeah
B	and they had to negotiate their pushchairs through other tables to get to it
