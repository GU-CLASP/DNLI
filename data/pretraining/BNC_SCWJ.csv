B	ninety-three
A	yeah
B	you don't want that do you?
A	no
B	you just
A	so they said we're in two frames of mind
B	right
A	but
B	oh okay
A	and then
B	mm
A	taken out erm
B	mm
A	so I rang the hospital on the Thursday
A	and that was on Thursday morning and then Thursday at ten fifteen
A	I know
B	my two would
B	yeah
A	he said I didn't know what to do
B	yeah yeah cos they don't know
A	yeah
B	and I suppose it is at the first
A	well nana died but they that was seven years ago so they were younger
B	so they were much younger
A	they were younger
B	shut them out really and said
A	yeah
B	mm
A	whereas I just come in and just barge straight
A	move the computer
B	group hug
A	yeah
B	oh
A	but erm
B	so have they said much since the boys?
B	mm
A	that's fine and we're all different and I said if you want to talk about anything or ask anything you can
B	oh yeah
A	and they were last Saturday subdued and on Sunday they kept saying when's dad coming home? when's dad coming home? will
B	mm
A	both of them wanted to just sit all over him really
A	erm
B	bit big for that
A	well yeah
A	but you know
B	oh
B	it's nice though
B	mm
A	so but they were subdued and then
A	can't get to sleep
B	oh gosh
A	and erm
B	mm
A	wasn't wasn't crying or upset or scared or anything
B	I mean that's the next big thing isn't it? that's a four-bedroom house in London they've got to sort out
A	I mean it's in London as well
B	that's gonna be horrendous
A	and it's got a massive garden
B	are they are they all full all these things?
A	oh yeah yeah
B	oh really?
A	yeah
B	gosh
A	and there's things like
B	utilities and
A	yeah
B	oh my goodness
A	yeah but
B	have you got a list of his friends?
A	yes but he hasn't got that many left
B	oh
A	doctors
B	right
A	right
B	to a lot of places
A	well
B	mind you some of that was
A	right
B	was in joint and she wanted to transfer to her name
B	sometimes they had to be originals
A	mm
B	mm
A	that's good good to know
B	but you've gotta empty all the house before you can even put it on the market
A	yeah and
A	but erm
A	just gut it
B	yeah
A	and they will
B	yeah
A	I know
B	it might end up getting ripped out again cos it's not the choice of the
A	well
B	and wants a wood one
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	or you know in the bathroom they
B	yeah
A	want to make it into a wet room or something you know?
B	it might be worth getting the advice of the estate agent
A	yeah
B	because they
A	yeah
B	whether the expense you'd go to
A	mm
B	would be worthwhile
A	I don't think he will
B	and you
A	no
B	yeah
A	and erm
B	you've gotta be there for quotes and people coming round and the workmen being there
A	I know
B	it's just
A	I know
A	you know?
B	mm
A	that yes you can do things to sell a house you can put in
B	mm
A	you can do that
B	where is it?
A	it's in erm
B	okay
A	so it's all of the houses round there are are big
B	mm mm
A	et cetera
B	you might they find though that by the time they've finished emptying it and going through it all they just want rid
A	yeah
B	but that that in itself is gonna be so time-consuming
A	I know
B	that by the time they a four-bedroomed house with a garage and an attic and a
A	mm
B	that's not even your stuff
A	I know
B	you
A	mm
B	they might just want rid by then so I shouldn't even worry about it until they've done that
A	on
B	cos that could take
A	I know
B	weeks
A	I think it was just them in their talking you know like
B	mm
A	you talk about stuff don't you? and they were just
B	yeah
A	oh
B	yeah
A	decorate it? do you think we need to
B	no
A	yeah
B	mm
A	there is no upward chain the person that lived here has died it was an elderly gentleman
B	it's all it's all
A	well it will and I just think because it is in a desirable area and it is a desirable property potentially anybody buying it
B	no
A	I think they will want to
B	yes
A	yeah
B	make it their own yeah
B	oh gosh
A	the same
B	oh that's good
A	because erm
B	mm
A	my sister had got a Halloween party on
B	okay
A	but I took the children
B	yeah cos she's still young isn't she? and she wanted the boys yeah
A	yeah
B	mm
A	because we had a chap ninety-three years
B	yeah
A	lovely career
B	yeah yeah
A	family home great children grandchildren
B	mm
A	nothing really to be sad about
B	no nothing no no
A	at all nothing to be sad
B	no
A	lived completely independently till the end
B	mm
A	you know so
B	yeah yeah
A	everything to celebrate
B	oh
A	because
B	mm
A	and then we were all there on Saturday and so he just wanted a few hours on his own
B	oh so he's got all that new work to do
A	so he's got all of that marking to do
B	and that's all new to him isn't it?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	and then
B	he and his brother?
A	he he's gone down
B	mm
A	they're meeting at the house
A	mm
B	I remember we had to go in
A	yeah
B	we
A	registrar of births marriages yeah
B	yeah yeah
A	so they've got an appointment to do that today and then he said are his affairs in order? he in his office he'd got all of his files
B	oh so he's
A	yeah
B	got his funeral plan?
A	yeah it's all done it's all paid for they've got an appointment at the funeral director tomorrow
B	oh gosh
A	and it says erm I wish to be cremated
B	god when did he do all that?
A	erm
B	gosh
A	I don't know it's all it's all in order
B	gosh
A	so so we're really lucky
B	yeah that that is that's
A	really lucky
B	that's a massive weight off everybody's mind that that's all done
A	yeah
B	mm
A	said yeah come in half past ten tomorrow
B	maybe there'll be a bit to pay or something
A	maybe
B	so have you got a date?
A	no
B	no?
A	because that's what they'll do tomorrow
B	mm
A	so they'll register the death and they'll go and see the funeral director
B	that's what I've heard crematoriums seem to have a backlog at the moment
A	ah
B	I heard somebody I
A	mm
B	okay
A	and it's more out in the country so we don't know if that's why but he said
B	how how many people do you think
A	yeah because they'll
B	all of his friends have
A	well
B	mm
A	that
B	yeah
A	will come
B	okay
A	so
B	yeah
A	he they will
B	right yes yeah
A	are still alive so I think they will probably come
B	will you take the boys down?
A	yes
B	so that'll be
A	yeah
B	well it'll be a weekday won't it?
A	I think they do
B	yeah yeah
A	I don't think they do them all weekends
B	I don't think they do no no
A	no
B	mm
A	oh what was I gonna say
B	oh he didn't even pick them up?
A	no
B	gosh
A	so he just gave he just said to them
B	mm
A	would you like erm
B	mm
A	and I said to
B	mm
A	and he said and in photographs and memories and stories and things he said I'm not gonna drive out to some remote crematorium
B	just to look at a a stained glass window or?
A	look at yeah
B	yeah well and he's got a very good point I suppose hasn't he?
A	mm
B	but everybody's different with how they want to
A	I know
B	mm
B	right well at least he's got a plan of what he wants and that makes it easier for you
A	yeah
B	so you've just gotta wait for the date now
B	mm mm
A	stuff and I don't know what to do about going back to work cos
B	well yes
A	I don't want to go back in the middle of a bereavement
B	what
A	Tuesday
B	oh Tuesday? okay
A	got a meeting tomorrow with my manager
B	mm?
A	and she knows what's happened
B	right
A	because I was late sending off my final sick note because I obviously I I got my final sick note
B	mm
A	and I just wrote a letter and said I'm
B	oh okay
A	and I thought
B	who had er who had instigated the meeting? they had?
A	no I did
B	you had? oh okay
A	because last time I went back to the doctor I said
B	mm
A	so he said I absolutely agree
B	mm mm
A	because I've got
B	yeah yeah
A	and er the whole being off
B	right
A	to come and see you
B	yeah yeah
A	if you want
B	going
B	you're better yes yeah
A	but er
B	have they have they you know when they when you went to the consultant last time they he changed the
A	mm
B	oh good
A	definitely
B	oh
A	that's another story
B	feel better
A	yeah
B	good
A	no that's why that's why I feel better
B	oh that's good
A	because
B	mm
A	I don't know I know you're used to being without
B	er well it's
A	you feel like the weight's on your shoulders don't you?
B	yes yeah you've gotta keep everything
B	everybody in the right place at the right time and they yeah yeah
A	yeah
B	yes
A	you know what
B	yeah
A	anyway but that's er I wasn't actually thinking about that but I wondered
B	subconsciously was that yeah
A	yeah
B	bothering you
A	but the panic attacks the palpitations
B	and do you think that's just cos he changed the dose?
A	yeah
B	he didn't change the tablet did he?
A	no but he's changed it
B	oh well that's good news though
A	it was the strongest amount and he's halved the strength
B	yeah
A	he's put it every other day so it's effectively he's quartered the amount
B	right
A	the the downside is that most well quite a lot of nights I have woken up in really bad pain
B	oh really?
A	yeah
B	did he say that might happen?
A	no but erm
B	oh gosh
A	not being able to get comfortable just having to take painkillers lying up the stairs lying on the
B	that came back but the side effects went
A	but
B	mm
B	before yeah
A	you know?
B	yeah
A	when it was like
B	so that's
A	normal yeah
A	er
B	how many weeks is that
B	since since you had the
A	no no since I've been on the well yeah no I didn't put two and two together
B	oh okay okay
A	oh bloody hell
B	right
A	and I know I joked to you and said I've put on loads of weight when I've been off and you said no you haven't you've been eating lots of lunches or whatever it is
A	and these tablets have put on weight but my tummy has been really
B	yeah for weeks and weeks you don't need that and have they said that's another side effect of the drug or they don't know cos they're new?
A	erm
A	don't
A	you know?
B	oh yeah
A	and it
B	just do it
A	yeah and to see what happens so
B	yes
A	so she said I want you to do
B	well you're used to it but
A	yeah and I don't have any problems and I don't stop running and I don't stop swimming
B	no
A	and just carry on
B	yeah yeah
A	and I don't have mood swings and anything like that
B	so
A	but obviously my
B	so has she sent the
A	no so she
B	oh
A	said book in
B	oh no
A	so the doctor wants to see you
B	so is that another possible side effect of the drugs? oh my goodness
A	yeah
B	oh gosh
A	he said what is the medication?
B	does it?
A	apparently so
B	oh gosh
A	are horrible
B	it does
A	well I
B	I mean I know you said they were new how many people have they told you any of that?
A	no
B	cos that does sound
A	but
B	that's a lot of
A	you know if you go to the doctor and you say oh I'm taking
B	do you say you're taking this and they've not heard of it?
A	they go oh
B	and they get their book out
A	they get the book out and look all through
B	oh
A	vomiting
B	god
A	haven't had vomiting luckily
B	I think that's high
A	and it
B	ten percent
A	and it's
B	oh
A	one in
B	experience this
A	but on this it's one in ten experience
B	ten experience
A	quite serious side effects
B	a lot
A	a lot of side effects
B	so how
A	well I think it's tested
B	well I wonder if that's because it would affect their fertility I mean if you've
A	don't know
B	yeah if it's obviously
B	er it might affect their fertility if it was younger women perhaps I don't know
A	it might do it might do
B	cos you wouldn't you wouldn't entertain the idea though would you if you were pregnant or breastfeeding but erm?
A	no but and also would you be in my I don't know when it says my age group I don't know what the age group the age group might range from
B	yeah yeah
A	but erm
B	to stimulate?
A	which it is
B	yeah yeah
A	but
B	you've got all this
A	mm
B	so
A	okay
B	don't you need to go and
A	oh er
B	yes yes you did
A	and
B	mm
A	erm so he's listed and he says to the GP which you may or may not be aware of
B	also?
A	erm
B	yeah
A	she's not very settled at home at the moment
B	there's a whole load you can't just take it on its own can you? and say
A	mm
B	like the drugs are doing this and this because there's so much else
A	yeah
B	going on
A	yeah
B	mm
A	you know I want to persevere on the drugs because there is some improvement
B	oh okay
A	erm apparently and also they're doing anaemia because
B	constant blood loss I assume
A	and erm
B	I'm never really sure what your thyroid is
A	well
B	oh
A	they were talking about anaphylactic shock
B	mm
A	not just like if you have an insect bite I'm allergic to it
B	yeah yeah
A	well in anaphylactic shock your whole body reacts
A	really?
B	no
A	that's what they were saying it's just like er
B	oh
A	your own body reacts to
B	against it?
A	yeah
B	well you don't want that do you?
A	no so
B	gosh there's a whole list of what a
A	I have to say
B	do you?
A	yeah
B	do you though?
B	oh gosh
A	well I couldn't because if you remember
B	no you couldn't you were in a lot of pain
A	well and the thing that started it off was that day at work
B	yes
A	when I was put with and you I told you and said
B	er yeah
A	because imagine if that had been something
B	oh absolutely you did need to go to the doctor and at least
A	mm
B	well
B	oh right so the best part of a year
A	because I remember
B	mm
A	going to see Mr
B	yes yeah
A	an appointment
B	see it's a long I mean it is a long
A	no for I know
B	off for appointments with the consultant off for this off for that because
A	no
B	still dealing with everything going on I
A	I know
B	I think they'll
A	I feel much now I feel well enough to go back to work I do feel well enough to go back to work
B	thing is though when you're at work
A	mm
B	you wouldn't
A	mm
B	but then
A	well
B	all the time and then you'd be saying oh what must they think? you know I've just come back after six weeks off
A	mm
B	and now I'm off again for you know this appointment and that appointment and
A	I mean I've got I'm gonna write the appointments down and when I see
B	mm
A	and then obviously she text me on
B	oh okay
B	she she'll yeah she'll understand
A	what exactly what it's like
B	mm
A	do not worry about anything
B	yeah no no and I think that'll do you good and also you'll find out what's gone on a bit more and you and
B	I don't
A	before I left
B	mm
A	become a quality manager
B	yes yeah but then you
A	I did
