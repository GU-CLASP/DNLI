B	yeah so
A	how did you do it?
B	I just like
C	like ten hours a day
B	I don't know how I did it exactly yeah that helps a bit it's just taking the weight off the wire
D	yeah yeah yeah
B	yeah that's good
D	might wanna double up on that little bit actually just er
B	I kind of leant on it as I got up with it
A	mm
B	like leant on it
A	mm
B	kind of shaken it
C	they are quite flimsy on the screen aren't they? you can't apply much pressure
B	I wasn't really thinking about what I was doing I was distracted
C	the plot thickens
B	I can't remember what now we was arguing about something and I wasn't thinking about the laptop on my lap
B	there we go well that is also
C	well we don't argue
B	there you go that's
B	no
C	I've broken all of her laptops
B	he's broken the last two genuinely
C	not out of anger
B	it's not like I actually put my fist through the screen or anything
C	well that was one of them
C	she left it on the table with the cable connecting the laptop to the
C	the sofa and I walked past and
A	ah it pulled off
C	yeah so
A	yeah
C	but

C	it's been a while
A	yeah definitely
C	it's different here to back at my mum's
A	it's even different er in different parts of England
B	yeah that's what I mean
A	yeah yeah oh when you say back home you mean
C	yeah
A	mm
B	I prefer the water
C	it's a completely different flavour in
A	mm
B	but I much prefer the water in
C	you've got lots of chalk so it's quite soft
B	yeah I think it really makes a difference
A	mm
B	I don't know if it's I wouldn't say our water's soft I think it's quite hard water
C	chalky's quite soft isn't it? I thought
B	it doesn't like do you remember like in
C	er
A	well I don't know because in
C	limescale that's hard water
A	so that's hard water
B	ah
C	and round my way we get loads of limescale and that's hard water
B	yeah
A	so that ours must be quite soft cos I never have to de-fur the kettle ever
B	no no no
A	yet I was
B	but the water it's ah maybe then
C	chalk is soft I'm pretty sure
B	yeah
B	it's nice
A	yeah the our our water
B	it tastes different too
C	I prefer the taste of hard but I grew up with hard
B	yeah well I always thought are you sure
A	well I think that might that might be what they put in it
B	yeah yeah
D	have you got a Phillips screwdriver here?
B	oh right yeah well isn't it? I thought I passed
C	there should be a screwdriver under the sink I don't know if it's Phillips
B	I feel like the water in
A	yeah
B	I feel like this water has a flavour almost like chlorine or something
C	it's also the pipe your own piping can affect it as well
B	yeah that's true mm it's just what you're brought up on as you said what are you after?
A	but even
D	screwdriver
B	didn't you bring yours with you? did you forget it?
D	it's in it's in the car somewhere I think it's in the back where you was
B	no I couldn't find it
C	let's have a look in here

A	and then it was sort of getting on a bit then so we had to get back to the car cos we only had the three hours
B	yeah we were almost at cos we walked along the lanes so we were almost coming towards the road that the train station road intersects coming down to Aldi so I thought oh we'll just walk to the charity shops but it would've been another ten minutes and then going around those charity shops
A	mm
B	and then had to have got all the way back to the car
B	and we only had fifteen minutes to do all that so

C	six have committed suicide and there's one that some other death
B	some other death
A	good grief
C	out of ten that's terrible isn't it?

C	cos he was showing me footage he got sent some footage er he's in about a second of it
B	oh what? when they were children?
C	yeah mm
B	oh really?
C	yeah

C	yeah so once he'd left so he left at like seventeen and then he came back at like nineteen or twenty and got a job there and worked there
A	oh
C	and
C	so they were good friends and obviously

C	it's brand new is it?
D	give us it here
A	mm it is it's never been used
C	oh it does look brand new
D	it is
A	it's still got the
C	did you say
A	yeah he
A	he's in working in recycling er now and somebody'd thrown put it in the skip
C	he was working with
A	yeah
C	what happened there?
A	well it it only lasted a couple of
C	oh no
A	when
C	that was a good job as well wasn't it?
D	I'll take that off don't need that sticker on
C	so wasn't he working with the binmen before?
A	yeah
C	so is he back with the same people? or different?
A	no no
C	no it's recycling?
A	he's recycling now yeah
C	has
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	so well I see it on the news that erm they'd been striking
C	oh it is on the news?
A	they have been on the news yeah
B	yeah
C	this is week three now
B	did I give you your water darling?
A	but they're not they only
B	no?
A	they only actually had a one-day strike or something didn't they?
B	I don't know how it happened cos our bins are meant to get collected on a Monday so not the Monday just gone today's Thursday so not Monday not the Monday yeah not the Monday before that it's been since the Monday so it's gonna it's it's been three four weeks by by this by this coming Monday since we've had anyone collect our rubbish
C	every morning there's like rubbish on the floor where the cats have been
B	yeah where the cats keep getting into it and stuff
A	oh
B	like ours happened I think it's only because the lady that lives above us she's lived here for twenty-five years she said
A	oh
B	she said that she it really annoys her cos she said
D	do you want me to take the paper off?
B	erm yeah okay oh no just leave it on for now
D	leave it on?
B	erm she said she actually paid to have it re-carpeted herself once cos
A	the lady who lives above you?
B	mm
A	oh so these
B	it's a two it's a two-bedroomed flat up there
A	so this house isn't owned by just one person then?
B	no no
C	no
B	there's different landlords
C	yeah
B	got different flats
A	oh
B	so the bit in the middle is no-man's-land
C	fancy owning just a bit of house
B	I know cos I remember how she said that she lived here cos we met her outside the door once you know so like
A	I thought she was the landlord when I first saw her
B	yeah we thought maybe she did own the building
A	mm
B	she was doing she does the pot plants outside the front door and she said yeah I've lived here for twenty-five years no one's ever done anything none of the walls have ever been repainted she said one year I did the carpet myself cos I got so fed up with it and again I went out yesterday and it's all been hoovered out there and I reckon it's probably because she tries to try and sell it
A	mm
B	or she just wants to keep it nice because she has some respect for it
C	when the binmen go on strike shouldn't it be the responsibility of the government to hire temporary workers to do it still?
C	I don't feel things just shouldn't get done
A	done mm
B	I don't wanna just lose my credit on the internet or anything
C	I mean the strike still has an impact cos the government effectively has to pay twice
B	yeah
A	mm
C	they pay for the strikers and they pay for the temps that are gonna do the job but to just leave it
D	you move it across the button
C	well we're still paying our taxes
B	oh yeah
A	yeah
C	and we're still paying you know your council tax
A	council tax
C	why isn't it being collected? I mean obviously
A	but but it wasn't er I mean they're not still striking it was resolved and it and I mean and I'm sure it was only for like a day or two days so why it hasn't been collected for three weeks I don't know
B	don't understand how to get to the menu though
D	no
C	very strange we've had the recycling round
B	oh here it is
C	we had them round earlier this morning
B	mm
C	but
B	mm
C	no erm
D	SIM card's alright?
C	we won't be able to last much longer if they don't come on Monday I don't know what will happen
C	go back to medieval times
D	don't know darling don't forget you ain't got the back on it yet
C	is it working alright?
B	yeah
D	bit complicated innit?
C	yeah these BlackBerrys
C	it's pretty good though
A	a contract with their phone contract and didn't want the phone I suppose they just wanted the contract
D	unless they threw it out by mistake
B	what? enter this PIN into your wireless router? why have I gotta enter a PIN into my router? how would I even do that?
D	what's a router?
C	can't enter a PIN in a router
C	do they have any instructions?
D	there's a book in there
A	have you got a
C	is it asking for?
B	yeah but it's not asking for the PIN router it's like telling me to put a PIN number into my router
C	well don't use the wireless
B	mm
C	just
B	no I just thought I'd
A	perhaps that's just the way it's worded
B	no it had a PIN number what do you mean? so when something says put this PIN number into your router
D	mm that's what it's there for
D	silly person
B	well no I don't maybe you're right
A	mm
B	it's it's word
A	means the PIN that it wants the PIN number for
B	but it had a number er for me to put into the router
A	oh did it?
B	yeah
A	oh
C	you can't put a number in a router so I don't really understand
A	no mm

D	you got your two-pin one you can plug in when you go abroad
D	yeah
B	and they do get
A	mm
C	that's a good idea isn't it? rather than making you buy another one
D	yeah
A	mm
B	you can tell when one of them's got a scratch or sometimes
C	it just slots in
C	should all be like that
B	and it's actually got a little split in it so it just affects your vision a little bit you can tell
A	so when you want new ones you go to the opticians do you?
B	yeah in Korea I just hand in my box of my last one
C	yeah it's just like going to the shop
B	and they were just over the counter
A	oh
B	whereas in England they'll probably check your eyes more often
D	that's for your laptop
C	oh is that for transferring
D	yeah
B	maybe not too often
A	yeah
B	once they but to initially get them in England you have to go through a whole checkup trial period with them whereas in Korea they just gave them to me
D	yeah
C	seems crazy
D	yeah
B	and I had to take a box in and stuff there might be more to it technically
B	but maybe cos I'm foreign they don't worry about it
C	oh well their loss our gain eh?
B	so yeah
A	I suppose
B	they're cheaper in Korea
C	oh it comes with a case as well?
D	yeah
C	have you seen the case?
B	ah I don't know what the
B	no it's not
B	yeah it's just a
D	yeah
B	so you don't lose lose it in your bag and scratch it and that I suppose
A	I suppose if you drop it it gives it some protection as well
B	yeah
D	or lean on it
B	just to protect it in the bag
C	like the laptop
B	taped it up it's fine
A	what what did you have to do to the bike then? what's wrong with?
A	tape what up?
D	the mudguard
A	mm
D	on a swivel
A	oh
D	just had to tape it round that's all
B	just a little bit of tape on it
C	Halloween costumes
D	really I
D	I
B	do you reckon ties would've worked then?
D	yeah
B	what would they've gone through?
D	well we'd just tie it onto one then across the other and then one in the middle
B	mm
D	do two loops then pull it together
B	been doing it for years DIY dad
C	talking about a zip tie thing?
B	yeah
D	that fan in there in the bathroom if you squirt some WD-40 in there that'll stop all that noise
B	do your reckon?
D	yeah
C	I can't get up there though
B	do your reckon?
D	yeah
B	I would er where do you squirt squirt
B	oh right
D	that's all you gotta do and on the side of it
B	need a little ladder or something
D	you've got a little button that you press it and it'll open it up
B	and then spray in
B	well someone
D	then you stop all that noise
B	no
C	you didn't ask me to fix your bike or anything though you just you know you haven't told me there was anything wrong with it
B	I didn't don't worry about it I don't care it was something we don't have any big old duct tape or something
C	I just feel bad every time your parents come round it looks like I don't do anything
B	that's not true
C	I just sit here and strum the guitar
B	they know it's not true
A	yeah does your smoke alarm work? or has it been tested yet?
B	no we should test it ourselves really
B	is it meant to flash?
D	yeah
B	cos it doesn't we are meant to check them every month it's part of our contract
D	yeah just press it and hold it if you can't reach it stand on a chair and then just get your broom
D	get your broom handle
A	you haven't burnt anything yet then
B	we've done toast but that's not burnt
A	mm
B	I don't think everyone burns their toast and sets it's only when you turn your toaster up and leave it up for a year or five years
C	thinking about it though my parents used to always set off the smoke alarm
B	yeah that's true
B	ours used to go off in my room quite often were they just more sensitive then?
C	the oven may be like not a very clean oven
A	sometimes the
C	sometimes the oven can smoke quite badly
B	your toaster did it quite often didn't it?
A	it still does sometimes with toast
A	yeah
B	because you put it on like number six instead of number three
A	yeah
D	have you got a smoke alarm out there and all?
A	but sometimes when I'm cooking a roast dinner just the actual heat
D	mm
B	I'm not sure actually
D	you should have
A	sets it off
C	the heat sets it off?
A	yeah it gets that hot
D	mind you if it catches alight you've only gotta go out on the balcony ain't you? tie two sheets together
B	oh no you'd jump down
D	no
A	are the children still as noisy? or have you got used to it? or are they not outside quite so much?
C	yeah I mean they've literally been going off all afternoon
B	screaming they've only just gone in and it's five o'clock
C	yeah
B	and when you were in earlier
C	they are really noisy I mean with that door shut and that door shut I can still hear them in in in my room
B	so the windows they don't do much cos they're not double glazed
A	no
B	so when I'm studying in here still they're they're a distraction
A	that room at the erm Travel Inn was we couldn't hear any noise could we?
D	no brilliant
A	it was really er
B	oh really? even though you're cos you're down on the ground floor aren't you?
D	yeah yeah
A	and it wasn't that far from the really busy road
D	road
B	no you weren't
A	no
D	yeah
B	ah modern technology
A	mm
C	are you light or heavy sleepers?
A	well
D	I'm light I am

B	the classic thing that I do quite often is I
B	but I can't see them it's er double strength so you can't see anything
A	mm
B	I er I did that this morning
D	yeah we all do stupid things like that with glasses
A	when I went to
B	and
D	wearing two pairs
B	how were you looking for glasses that you were wearing?
A	well I don't know
C	does happen don't it? you can go a bit crazy
B	it's worrying that's what it is
C	I accidentally put my er washing when I lived at my parents' house in the toilet instead of the the washing basket
C	cos there was like a washing basket near the toilet
A	toilet
C	just they opened the toilet and
B	recently
D	yeah
C	so who was it? somebody put the kettle in the fridge or something or something random was put in the fridge that wasn't meant to be in there
B	that'll be me oh I put the kettle in the fridge
C	no not recently no
B	oh
C	that was back when I was a kid
B	oh right
B	I put the kettle in the do you remember I put the kettle in the fridge? cos er we had a
C	there's a pen in the freezer
B	some of the red pens were in the freezer I was like oh it had to be me
B	dunno why it's in there
A	ah
C	maybe you sleepwalk
B	yeah maybe oh what? to another flat?
C	yeah walk next door
B	no
C	kettle in the fridge pen in the freezer
B	oh no
D	so you want a fan
B	yeah to blow the washing dry this winter might be useful extra bit of
B	if you spot one for a good price
C	it's a shame we don't have access to this garden this guy just doesn't use
B	I know he doesn't use it at all
C	at all nobody's been when we moved in there were quite a few plants and things growing in there
B	there were tomatoes runner beans the squirrels have ate them all
C	yeah it's all just dying you know
A	oh
D	it's a shame innit?
B	mm
C	it's a Chinese lad I think
B	yeah

C	shh oh don't say it
B	have a giggle every time
A	and we come in

B	yeah literally like half an hour on on the phone
C	sitting there sitting there not getting through to anyone I tried emailing them finally got through she's telling me I need to go and talk to the Post Office
B	because they haven't registered
C	cos cos my address isn't registered and I said well that's crap because I've received quite a few bits of post and I've picked up post from the Post Office from my address I don't see why I should have to go to the Post Office to sort out my water this just seems ridiculous and in the end she was like she's gonna make up the address and they'll contact me that was two or three weeks ago and I haven't had any contact
B	anything but Southern Water the guy that lives next door
C	yeah
B	he had something come through from them
C	addressed to flat four
C	so it's
B	so they do have it they must have it registered somewhere
C	they're not gonna fine us or anything though are they? I've tried to contact them
B	no I mean they er
C	yeah exactly I'll just pay it in one chunk rather than in
D	mm
B	yeah that's it er she said unless your landlord pays for it and I said well that'd be bloody lovely but I'm sure we'd know about it if they did
A	if it was in with the rent
B	I don't know have we tried the agency?
C	and the Southern Water was on there
