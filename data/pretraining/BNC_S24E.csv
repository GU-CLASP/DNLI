A	the idea is to meet
B	that's he just not
A	which case it makes it harder for
B	no no it's no fun
A	and
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	no I thought let's take is we're going to meet them let's go to some sort of activity like er an adventure park or a a zoo or a something and take a picnic and walk round and chat and let the children have fun and run about
A	well what we were thinking is we'd go for lunch and then we'd do that but lunch is not the main event you know because with the the kids
B	well let's just have a picnic or fish and chips or you know
A	we could but it's not as fun
C	it's
A	picnic is only nice when it's really sunny otherwise it's depressing
B	yeah it's what I mean is if you book a restaurant for lunch I mean a nice café is better with a little park and as you say just have a quick lunch you know
A	yeah
B	not a if you want to have a nice meal chat lunch it's too much for the kids
A	yeah it doesn't work that's what she said as well which is fine yeah well in that case we should just decide on like a park or something to meet them and go around
B	mm bring their bikes have a walk
A	have a walk the kids can do whatever
B	and have a some sort of café lunch
A	mm
B	no that's the trouble mm
A	and but she said even then she said the children will be crazy
B	take the kids mm
A	they'll be cooped if they're cooped up then it won't be a nice thing
B	no you need the swimming pool and the whole thing
A	you need to be doing stuff with them don't you? and that's fine and we could go out well we don't even have to go out all the time it's not really necessary
B	no and I mean I'd love I'd love to cook and be happy to but also it's nice to eat out and
A	mm
B	enjoy it makes it that
A	yeah groovy
B	erm but would you like to go to the Queen's Head? and does he eat fish?
A	yeah
B	okay so that makes it easier
A	Queen's Head we should go Saturday maybe
B	yeah just cos I think it's an it's an English pub
A	yeah I know defo
C	mm
B	it's old quirky and he can have a little half pint of some ale and he can either have
C	steady on
B	one of the traditional well he might not fancy a full pint
A	poor guy he's not he's not erm
B	a drinker
A	a drinker
C	not a drinker
B	that's just as well
A	not that he's like so
B	he just doesn't do it
A	it's like
B	no
A	not really maybe like they'd do
B	so the Israelis not really have wine?
A	no not really
B	no
A	it's not like it's not sort of like a Mediterranean every meal there's a wine bottle of the wine on the table not really
B	mm it's not like that
A	I mean the boys would have a beer maybe but
B	mm
A	they don't go out a drink they do
B	mm
A	have a great nightlife but a lot of it is coffee shops as well so people drink coffee
B	mm interesting
A	like in Greece they did that as well people would be going out to have a coffee at like ten PM eleven PM as a social thing you know so
C	right
B	mm interesting
A	it's not really alcohol-orientated I mean people go out and party and like that's what he did when he was young as well drinking alcohol and having fun but not like in the way it is here
B	but
A	no I know but I'm just saying it's not because he's like erm pious or something
B	no it's just no god
A	erm I mean the vegetarianism was the same as me he just did it a long time since a long time ago erm but he does eat fish so
B	that makes it easier
A	makes it a lot easier yeah
B	at the
A	otherwise you have to have some kind of dodgy
B	whatever they yeah
A	spinach filo thing
B	something
B	that they dream up
A	stew
B	but they do of course do their lovely pies and they do vegetarian ones
A	I know yeah exactly
C	they do yes
A	I've seen that that could probably be nice actually
C	the pies are nice aren't they?
A	no they have a few fishy options at the Queens
C	pies are every good
B	and they
A	he's gonna have to try ale I've told him this already but I'm not seeing his light lights in his eyes about it
B	no I can imagine
A	I don't think anyone who didn't grow up with it is gonna go mm that's delicious
C	no it's an acquired taste
A	it's quite weird isn't it?
C	it's an acquired taste yeah
B	so er a boat down Ullswater
A	sounds lovely
C	ah the steamer eh
B	the steamer down Ullswater and a little walk along the lake and some hot chocolate
C	yeah that'll be nice
A	mm exactly
C	we could do the walk
B	no will you just get walks out of your head
B	he's got a sore knee he's got a seriously sore knee
C	oh that's try yes
A	yeah he's very injured dad he's not like a minorly injured he's
C	forgot about the knee sorry
B	he's
C	sorry
B	and also
C	shan't mention it again
B	no but for someone who's fit and active
C	you're right
B	it's actually really bothering
C	you're right
A	it's a bit of a bane in his life yeah
B	erm and he's feeling a little bit like you know not so nice about it he's worried isn't he?
C	oh you just had me enthused walking from
B	no I was thinking of the little stroll we did with my dad
B	along the edge of the lake
C	just round the jetty
A	yeah that's more like it
C	you do you get hot chocolate at the jetty?
B	you can in that nice little café at the end
C	oh I know you one you mean yeah
A	I was a bit divided because erm on the one hand that
B	oh so I agree
A	and even if it's really we'll do that on Sunday
B	and the hot chocolate there is no but what about morning and afternoon I mean that's also we could go in the morning and even have lunch at the Mill I mean they have gorgeous vegetarian options
A	oh right go in the morning
C	oh lunch at the Mill
A	yeah that's a good idea and then after we'll go to
C	that's yes
B	and then drive down to
C	they have lots of veggie things as you know
A	Ullswater
B	Ullswater and and go
A	that sounds good
C	so where does that leave us with
A	that's on Saturday Sunday
B	and then this
A	Sunday is with
B	and obviously you might want to go out on your own as well
A	no it's too short
B	but yeah it's too short
A	not at all we'll see each other another time and just be you know
B	but yeah just you
A	and erm
B	but erm the and
A	that she can get to
B	that she can get to north of her
A	yeah
B	but you know
A	I mean she said that she'll know more as well I mean if
B	it becomes a lot easier
A	erm yeah so that sounds like a plan doesn't it? I mean erm
B	and then we could
A	it's nice to drive
B	which way?
A	you know when you drive on the motorway it's when you go up to
C	which road?
A	the M
B	oh going across to
A	is that the M6?
B	the A66 is the nice road
C	the A66 you mean?
B	as you go across towards
C	you don't get the M6 to
A	I don't know
B	the M6 is going down to
C	north south the M6 is
A	yeah but I thought
B	no it's west
C	west
B	due west
A	mm
C	yeah well I think that I think that's a quite a
B	hey I was the one that bloody spider you still haven't got rid of it my love
C	I've got rid of two already
A	there's a lot of them there's new one in my sink every day
B	where?
A	it's just that time of year
B	that one he's having the life of Riley you keep putting a cup over him and then dropping him before he gets out of the window
C	oh come on
A	no mum there's a whole family
C	er you're right
A	yeah it's beautiful isn't it? I just hope it's like that
B	yeah that's all we need
A	but the chances are fairly low
B	we just need a little bit of sun erm
C	we could go your favourite one's Thirlmere go to Thirlmere go down to Ambleside
A	Ullswater to Thirlmere is nice isn't it?
B	erm or
C	or Thirlmere down to Ambleside
A	in fact if we eat at the Queen's Head on Saturday we can just go straight there can't we? if we're at Ullswater
C	yeah
B	yeah so everything works
A	that sounds like a plan yeah erm because it was really funny you know how your phone tells your location is you let it to the other people that are using it so while I was here last time or whenever he texted me saying how is it at the Mill Inn café? and I'd never mentioned it before I was like what are you doing? you're spying on me
A	the Mill café erm in
A	I told him about the hot choccy there it's pretty good
B	pretty amazing
A	mm
C	that's a winter thing isn't it?
A	er not
B	it'll feel pretty damn chilly to him I should imagine
C	you have your you have your winter clothes on
A	yeah I think he's going to be quite cold bless him
C	you can see your breath and then you go in and have a hot chocolate
A	because even in Germany he was moaning and I was like mm you wait
B	wait till you get to the damp
A	wait till the real cold happens I think they must have colder winters there
B	oh yes it'll be in land won't it?
C	in Germany they do yeah
A	mm it was kind of just north of the erm
B	mm
A	I mean just north because Germany is a big country but you know like
B	it was north of
A	immediately north
C	Stuttgart were you near to Stuttgart
A	yeah quite near to Stuttgart yeah it was like you could have flown to Stuttgart or Frankfurt is was kind of in the middle of the two yeah
B	beautiful country mm
C	mm
A	it is a really beautiful country you forget that don't you?
C	yes it is
B	mm
A	especially that
C	we tended to go south for the warmth but Germany was
C	did a few little weaken Germany's didn't we?
B	yeah
A	that's what I feel like you know we we went there
B	mm it wasn't
A	have you ever been to the Oktoberfest?
B	no
C	no
A	mm
C	the beer drinking you mean?
A	I think the main event is beer drinking but erm I think you can do it in quite a civilised way it's not all kind of I mean I'm sure there's a lot of stag dos and
B	I think there might be
A	British lairyness
B	British bill beer-swilling
A	but erm
C	well German beer-swilling
C	they do steins don't they?
A	stein
C	yeah
B	mm oh you would Dutch
A	from the Dutch yeah
B	the Dutch would be a big hook
A	and erm
C	yeah
B	did you do O level you did erm GCSE German
C	I always enjoyed
A	I did GCSE and I did A level for a while but then I dropped up cos I was doing five I think but erm I really enjoyed it and erm
C	sounds like you were impressed with Germany
A	I was I think we all were we were all kind of like we've been in all these places you know and erm
B	mm and here we are
A	we thought Greece was going to be pretty ideal
B	the best
C	yeah
A	for us cos we thought it will be cheaper and it's kind of beautiful and erm
B	you're on an island and it's peaceful
A	Greek people are nice and in fact it's really popular to do yoga type stuff you know a lot of people do meditation slash yoga retreats in Greece cos you know it's a bit of a
C	yeah yeah
A	and the atmosphere was just very very nice and peaceful and erm you know simple in a simple way you know I don't know how to explain
B	mm mm I yes I I remember when we went at so I'm I'm going to say that I think that it's probably just very similar but every time I was in Switzerland and every time I was in
A	yeah
B	I had exactly the same that the bedroom would be just beautiful clean simple like a wooden bed and when you got in it was the softest duvet in the world and the just white cotton and just it would feel like heaven and it was always simple and clean and the air was pure clean fresh
A	exactly mm yeah
B	and it just felt really really nice
A	mm
B	just erm like you
C	you must be a northern European at heart
B	I must be I just really liked that erm
A	I do as well I mean I this is the difference as well that I feel that I there's a certain kind of home familiarity
B	yeah
A	that you you know as soon as you get further south like Mediterranean south it really does feel like you're a foreigner
B	it's quite
C	different
B	you're a you do you don't know
A	you don't quite understand why people are behaving in that way
B	I know and I I
A	which is fun but
B	it looks bare
C	parched
B	and grey and
A	very dry
B	dried out and I love when you're in the green forest
A	yeah that's what the Israelis were saying
B	and it's warm
A	they were like it's so green
B	mm and it's warm
A	we said yeah yeah I mean it it was there yeah
B	er you know that is and then the air is like pure and the mist goes up from the mountains that to me is like the most beautiful
A	I agree with you
C	what about Norway then is it how do you compare with Germany and Norway?
A	mm I loved Norway Norway is
B	stunning
A	absolutely stunning
B	just colder and darker
C	scenically I know that but I meant in terms of the the general pace of life
A	yeah similar yeah very similar I mean it's like a
C	similar to Germany?
A	even yeah I mean it's got its own flavour because first of all I think they're a bit ethnically different like you know they have like they look different the Norse thing is there I don't know it's like Scottish and English you know it's like there's something where you say there's a
C	yeah
A	not only spiritedly
B	mm
A	you know so I feel like
C	the Norseman
A	have more of a Celtic thing as well that they just yeah something is
C	mm
A	erm and also it's just a quite a unique place I think because it's so small and because small population and they're sort of doing their own thing up there
C	they're doing their own thing I think that's what I would say rather than it being integrated in Europe it's more
A	exactly feels less European
C	feels Norwegian
A	and they have this very strong socialist thing
B	I'd like to go and you do though
A	erm in terms of how the people of how people think about stuff that's really a strong influence and er they have quite a different mentality because of it I mean I got to know it because of
B	mm
A	came
C	mm
A	through any way you know through achievement for instance which you know is one of the main differences
C	I I found that the family thing was very strong
A	yeah
C	you in the when I went over generally speaking when I went to somewhere people would
A	mm
C	but the Norwegians they were out of the door at four o'clock whatever happened
A	yeah no chance
C	it was very much the family first
A	mm
C	yeah none of this er you know now of the super super hard work for
A	work no well they don't have the same kind of the motivation precisely for that reason or that's what
C	mm
B	mm explore the other side
A	yeah because it's a bit deadening he
A	yeah erm you said about family we have a couple in the teaching she's Norwegian and he's Israeli and they met when they were travelling abroad and he lives there with her now they have a child and erm I was talking to him about it sort of saying how how do you find Norway I can't think of any two more diametrically opposed countries
B	mm Israel
A	be in Israel for like many good reasons but erm I said to him have you managed to integrate into the erm culture?
B	mm
C	yeah
A	and he said well I've been there for ten years and maybe just
A	you know? because they are and I found that to be true as well people are just very er burried in on their own world
B	in their own world
A	life there yeah and they were quite unused to foreigners cos they didn't have immigration until quite recently
C	mm
A	so I could just
B	and that's no no
C	it's funny though cos we we we generally saw the other side didn't we when we went down south on holiday
B	mm
C	and sort of got the
B	yes but I also often felt more at home
C	right
B	you know when we would go out when we went on holiday to France we'd go out in the afternoon and Spain to buy food for our picnic and everybody was asleep
C	Spain was like that
B	and we didn't know what we were doing we felt you now kind of confused
A	it's a bit weird isn't it? yeah we did the same the Greece the first day you know always when you arrive you kind of don't get it yet and erm we tried all the restaurants were empty you know this was at nine PM anyway we thought we were late for dinner
B	mm mm no no that's right
A	and erm
B	well we could never had any problem getting a table cos we were far too early
A	exactly and then you see at eleven
B	everybody's out
A	everyone's out and about
B	mm no quite
A	the climate in Norway is considerably colder than Europe
B	yeah
A	I mean it really is very cold there
B	and darker in the winter
A	it's
B	mm and rain
A	and snow
B	and snow
C	yeah
A	so everyone skis
C	I think the south of Norway's on a par with
B	no
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	and I mean the thing is is it's the Gulf Stream
B	but it's not it's not even Stavanger wouldn't be the same weather as
C	because of the
A	because it's on the west coast
C	western winds
B	it's on the west yeah
A	it is like an incredible statistic it's like I think it's from Bergen I think it's like a
C	really?
A	a year
B	oh dear
C	no you're probably right in term of temperature
B	yeah
A	no temperature no and also the thing is erm the Gulf Stream goes I think it goes south of Britain and then it goes up towards erm Scandinavia and that's the only reason that it's even inhabitable
C	it's not frozen yeah
A	because if you look at the equivalent
B	mm
A	you know latitude south you know there's nothing it's just an ice cap
B	mm mm
C	yeah
A	mm
C	that's true yeah
B	and it's leaving us in you you know it's it's it's warming below us instead of warming us
C	yeah
B	and causing us to be right in a kind of low pressure above it
A	rubbish
C	there was a thing in the paper
A	but if it moves we're stymied
A	we're stymied yeah that's what they say as well
C	there was a thing in the paper was it the paper we saw it? it said erm the forecast is that Europe gets
B	mm darn
B	it's not even funny
A	erm
B	the last two summers have been hugely disappointing haven't they?
C	more than that I think four or five
A	you say this but I mean I
B	three three ago was a good summer
C	was it?
B	yeah well I
A	well you've been in Scotland so I think
B	I was just down at
A	it's always sunny at
C	no
A	changes there
B	mm I think it's they've got the high mountains to the
C	it'll be the mountains Welsh mountains
B	west of them and I I think that just takes the rain off and then they just get that little bit of protection
C	might be a bit of rain shadow
B	from the rain shadow and then as you move across the it's a big valley and then the Pennines
A	mm
B	then Manchester's just at the foot of the Pennines so it gets the rain again as it as the clouds lift back up but there's just that little splodge in the middle where
A	yeah yeah
C	yeah
B	not erm she'd moan
C	so have we got a climate tick box for our house-hunting?
B	I have and and and I know that sound pathetic but I have
C	yes
A	I think it's fair enough yeah
B	I
C	yes
B	that it's right
C	yes
B	and you've got that Manchester weather basically
C	that's why it's green
A	well every where's green
B	every where's green you know we all get in
C	the Dales are very green aren't they?
A	mm
B	yeah we all get enough wet
A	we all get enough rain to last us
B	mm
A	yeah it's fair enough
B	you need to be on the east coast to be dry
A	I I I I do think it would be
B	but I just because of
C	in Dorset Dorset would be nice
A	that's what
C	oh yeah?
A	erm Devon I think and she was like yeah but why did you move back to England to erm if you're going to live in Devon? cos they I I think I told you they moved to Spain
B	mm did they?
C	oh they did yeah
A	yeah they had a house there erm when they retired and they lived there for a few years and they just missed the family too much and you know realised that that was really what was important to them overall in terms of their retirement
C	right
B	mm
A	so they moved back to England but they moved to
C	moved to Devon for the weather
C	it is it is
B	it's very far away from here
A	and her sister's at
B	that was the plan
A	but
C	oh dear
B	yeah but then
A	the flexibility to go down yeah well they do quite often at the weekend they
B	but they're cold here he
C	cold
B	how are you? cold
C	yeah cos they don't have heating
B	no that's right
A	erm we had we were laughing about it they I think have to provide a er oil radiator for her parents in the bedroom
C	right
A	cos they just won't put up with it
C	no ever likely they won't
A	but they both quite often go away for the weekend I think they go down to
C	right
A	or wherever you know erm that's where their friends are and stuff they kind of wanted to have it that way round
C	so where is she from
A	he was in the army so they've moved around a lot
C	oh right
A	was it the Navy? maybe in the Navy
B	mm
A	but erm they did spend quite a few years up here in
C	mm
A	I don't exactly remember where I think a bit further south than here so that's where she came back
B	but the
C	in Devon?
B	in Devon
C	yeah
B	and I feel that for us it it it's important to
A	just an arbitrary
B	that is arbitrary
A	well Devon would be really arbitrary wouldn't it?
C	mm yeah
A	whereas but I think I mean in a way they're probably in a similar situation to you they've lived in a lot of places and when it came down to retiring they didn't know where
B	where to retire to
A	to retire yeah
B	and the children are far apart
A	exactly
B	er and you you just don't know
A	mm
B	erm
A	you look poised to do something mum
B	I am going to do the ironing because I'm sitting here and I got up specially I've been awake since seven o'clock and I've nothing yet erm so I need to do the ironing
A	you're
C	yes that alarm was very early wasn't it? I was
B	well I've been I was awake long before the alarm as well
C	oh were you? oh heck
B	mm
B	darn alarm was at seven o'clock
A	where did you go on your cycle then?
C	oh I just did the er across to
C	is it
C	and then across to
A	it's a bit of a climb when you go when you turn at
C	yes yes yes
A	a gentle one but a very long road
C	that's right a gentle one yes I did by the way I did the
A	on your bike
C	yes I I've been sort of a little bit chicken really but I thought you should do this it wasn't that bad?
A	yeah
C	no I was the only the only slight embarrassment was I was very close to the top and this guy just kept kept went sailing past on the
C	so I I put it down to the bike
A	was he Lycra-clad?
C	he er yes he had all of the all of the gear
A	there you go there you go there's a lot of those around here you just have to
C	yes
A	they have very very light bikes
C	there must be something yes
A	very very light framed bikes I think that's one of the things that's good for
C	yeah
A	and gears galore
C	they must be fit as well though
A	did you go up on first gear?
C	I did in this one yeah
A	mm I think there's no other way
C	I I I I've moved up to second gear to get out of
C	I'm aiming to go onto third gear soon
C	yeah
A	that you should walk if you're walking on an incline you should walk at a pace that you feel that you're not walking on an incline meaning you should keep a continuous
C	right
A	you know so that's the way
C	I think that's right yeah I I I try to keep it steady
A	you know so I take that with the bike as well and if it takes you know if you're in first gear and you just take a really long time to get up the hill at least you get up there and you can carry on then for quite a while you're not exhausted
C	yeah yeah yeah yeah no it's the same walking try to keep it steady whether it's up or down
A	exactly yeah
C	but your mother's the opposite she sort of gets slower and slower going up
C	and then she sort of leaves me behind on the way down
B	the other thing is erm er that we need to get our I need to go to email
C	sounds like a mission you mean about the moving?
B	moving the things
C	yeah well the only thing I need is is Pickford's and then I then I've got the whole set
B	yeah so
A	take a erm photograph of
B	I that's what I thought I would do cos I did send her a photograph
A	she did some before and after shots as well
B	yeah so erm I'll do that yeah I don't know where changing your mind about the finish comes in you know that's really
A	no that's your job
B	that's our problem not theirs
A	mm I mean you could ask them to do it but they would pay they would have you'd have to pay them
