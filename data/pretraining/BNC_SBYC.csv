B	they have sweatshops but on the other hand I know from Africa cos people will always say oh servants don't want to mix with you having servants and exploiting them if they didn't work as servants they wouldn't have any money at all
C	in Africa you mean?
B	in Africa and they like it was one of the top jobs was to work as a servant
D	well surely it's the name
B	and they just couldn't understand that you know?

C	yes she is
B	well they said they told me that I should have been out in an aisle seat

B	no and I don't want them to say well you can go on a flight tomorrow
C	no
B	mm no that won't
