A	and here we are crawling through the undergrowth in search of a greater spotted Dawn
A	huh?
B	it's like a steam thing
A	yeah
B	ah it's boiling
A	it's silly cos I'm wearing erm clean clothes as well
B	why are you wearing clean clothes to do gardening? Oh
A	shall we sit over the other side? The wind's blowing this way
B	well it's not at the moment but it will be yeah
A	huh
B	I think I'm jinxed
A	yeah it tends to do that doesn't it?
B	sit on this hill bit
A	yeah
B	I was thinking about my pond again cos that willow
A	yeah
B	Cos erm
A	yeah you could have bent that over couldn't you?
B	oh god  when it was  when it was growing when it was a baby look it even wants to go that way
A	that's willow is it?
B	I
A	right so if you buried that on the other side it would grow
B	I think it will root
A	it will root?
B	I think it will root
A	huh
B	that would be cool
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	why?
B	it's a shame
A	mm
B	they just start sprigging around
A	mm
B	if  I would  I would do that
A	that would take years though wouldn't it?
B	no I don't think it took that long for that tree to grow
A	yeah
B	yeah of coarse it would
A	hmm
B	God my face is roasting
A	it's hot here actually
B	it's good it's like a sauna isn't it?
A	yeah
B	I think did dad say anything
A	putting potatoes in it?
B	I don't know
A	erm well I think it will be fine like that
B	well I think
A	it's not going anywhere is it? It's burnt off all the stuff
B	well I'd rather not
A	okay
B	I'm going to sit until my fire is finished
A	you look like one
B	no that's just the laces
A	oh
B	they've all come apart for some reason
A	yeah why
B	Don't know
A	Cos it's clay isn't it?
B	yeah
A	I thought clay was supposed to hold water
B	yeah that's what we thought when we dug it
A	oh I don't know
B	paddle it
A	poddle it
B	I don't know
A	yeah
B	it doesn't want to take
B	hm
A	was there?
B	when we had all that rain
A	yeah but he's got a hose leading from the runoff as well
B	yeah
A	so that's why it's got
B	yeah what the runoff off the shed? Yeah
A	I suppose if he keeps burning stuff in it it's gonna create a seal isn't it?
B	but it you've got to think
A	that's the idea
B	but what about that part of it?
A	well I don't know
B	oh
A	yeah
B	I just thought it was a nice place because it it was all indented in the thing
A	well
B	I don't know
A	hmm
B	oh
A	mm
A	mm
B	for it
B	so I dug the
A	mm
B	here this is what it's going to look like
A	mm mm
B	and we found the end of the hose pipe right there
A	the hose is underground?
B	yeah cos we used to have the goat sheds there until they all burnt down
A	yeah
B	they all burnt down so we had water
A	oh okay
B	from I think it was from the
A	ah
B	from the dairy coming down to feed the goat sheds
A	yeah
B	and so there was a a hose pipe underground there and we dug the pond just in the right place and we found the end of the hose pipe
A	ah
B	and it was like this is fate
B	actually no I think that was the I think that might have been the summer that I was grounded when I was sixteen actually
A	hmm mm
B	that was exiting summer wasn't it?
A	mm
B	well that's why I was grounded
A	yeah I know
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	I never notice it
B	that's cos you never go around the parks late at night
A	mm
B	like bless them they're only like a bunch of kids hanging out most of the time
A	well yeah it was only because I didn't have anything else to do
B	yeah
A	and that was the only interaction with
B	that's what I mean you see these gangs
A	it was the only interaction with girls I ever had
B	what girls did you meet then?
A	well drunk ones
B	ah it's a shrew
A	it's a shrew
B	ah he was a hoppy shrew wasn't he?
A	did he just come out of the fire?
B	no
A	hmm
B	so what girls did you meet down the park?
A	oh no one special
B	and never got it with the girls
A	yeah
B	Cos you're too drunk
A	yeah
B	okay
A	right
B	well I think we've got fourteen tents
A	fourteen
B	but it's like we're trying
A	I don't know how how big are these tents though?
B	yeah I know
A	well we've got a few months to get rid of these twigs and stuff
B	yeah well what if we go away? We won't be able to do it will we?
A	well no but we're going to be back beginning of August aren't we? so
B	right well there's some space there
A	yeah that's one two three
B	three maybe four
A	mm mm
B	okay
A	yeah but I was thinking about that cos you said that but this guy here next door
B	yeah
A	so are you really going to want to?
B	well it depends
A	yeah but he might be doing loads of work there and then it's
B	okay let's put
A	what this is where the?
B	the drunkards come
A	mm
B	yeah yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah that's what I thought would be nice
A	yeah
B	I thought that would be nice
A	yeah
B	and then this can all be our
A	mm mm
B	it will be like a little cove and you'll have to like duck to get under here
A	yeah
B	well do you want to sleep in the old truck?
A	I don't know
B	we could sleep in here
A	are these chairs okay?
B	yeah
A	see
B	so you don't want to sleep in here?
A	well I don't want to sleep in here no
B	well they can have a bit of fun
A	please put coins here
B	or call round for change
A	bastards
B	oh we can
A	huh this is cool isn't it? this
B	why not?
A	well
B	then if it rains we won't have a problem
A	but where are you going to put the ground pegs?
B	we won't need it because there won't be any wind
A	you need a mattress
B	it's massive isn't it?
A	it is
B	it's a storage truck
A	it could be
B	mm I don't think they would want to
A	it could be er some big Norfolk producers
B	drugs bust
A	that's brilliant that is
B	why would it collapse?
A	well the weight of all that stuff foliage on top
B	no
A	no?
B	no
A	well I suppose it's been there how many years? It reminds me of those er temples in Angkor Wat
B	yeah
A	with all the plants and trees growing out of them
B	mm
A	huh
B	if you see on the side that's where we painted
A	this used to be the health food van?
B	yeah
A	you've got secret pathways everywhere
B	it says furnishing
B	I don't know why it says furnishing
A	well it's an old furniture truck isn't it?
B	I thought it was an old library van
A	yeah
B	anyway
A	and then we're going to have to light up around the pond
B	but like you said right look
A	yeah
B	it's too bumpy
A	mm
B	I think so
A	look
B	you could even fit
A	it is a bit bumpy isn't it?
B	yeah
A	mm
B	well I don't know what we're going to do
A	how far does your garden go? Does that?
B	just to there
A	yeah
B	gosh
A	that is a pathway yeah
B	because they've walked it so many times
A	I've I've never seen her come through
B	have you not?
A	is that her workshop?
B	yeah
A	oh really?
B	yeah
A	oh
B	Don't know why we've not been introduced really
A	yeah cos that owl box you had to cut all the trees down in front of it because the owls need er like a runway otherwise they won't take to it
B	really?
A	yeah so that that bit of branch hanging down there is probably stopping one from moving in
B	oh I see
A	because they come in like a plane and they need
B	well I could get oh it's just too high isn't it?
A	yeah
B	you need the ladder
A	huh?
B	just that little one there
A	er no this one here
B	yeah
A	yeah that one
B	yeah
A	mm
B	right do you reckon this fire is done now?
A	I reckon that will be alright
B	yeah?
A	but I don't know what to do about these tents
A	no
B	oh they they'll have to just
A	it will be alright
B	yeah but some of these holes in the land are incredibly bumpy
A	I mean if they didn't want to stay in a tent they would have got a bed and breakfast anyway
B	oh that just fell over
A	well cos we've got all that down there as well to the hill that we could use
B	well like you know all those twigs aren't there
A	yeah twigs you can move those
B	mm
A	Cos we can go all the way down there to the allotment
B	yeah and the allotment will have to be closed off
A	yeah that will all be closed off for the kids
B	God it's hot
A	yeah
B	we've got some marshmallows
A	we've got some?
B	yeah
A	let's go and get them then
B	okay
A	alright
B	we just burnt all the sticks
A	yeah you just need
B	lovely
A	pink ones or white ones?
B	I can't remember I just
A	why do they have different ones? Because they both taste the same
B	no they don't they're slightly different
A	they do
B	are they?
A	it's just the colouring
B	I don't know
A	and why are they always pink and white? Why don't they make different colour ones?
B	I think they make blue ones don't they?
A	blue marshmallows?
B	oh maybe not
A	it's one of those weird traditional things isn't it?
B	this is very flat
A	er well
B	oh no it's not
A	it's not
B	yeah
A	erm we'll just have to make sure people have got mattresses
