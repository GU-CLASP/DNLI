A	I'm glad there's the two who I almost came to well not came to blows but
A	erm
B	did you put your foot in it somewhere?
C	no idea where they've been put
A	no no no a man
B	partners
A	one of them was just so anti-Muslim
B	oh gosh
A	that it was I I mean
B	embarrassing
A	it shocked me
A	absolutely shocked me so
B	oh dear
A	I was handing round drinks so I moved on I thought I can't
B	how did
A	I can't listen to you any more
B	how did it come up anyway then?
C	cheers
A	erm I
B	I bet you wish
A	I mean I didn't bring it up it
B	oh right
A	but it it suddenly sort of
B	he obviously wanted to vent his frustration
A	mm
B	or something
A	yeah er you know erm
B	mm
A	so but I don't they were I don't think they were there this year yeah I had a lovely jolly chat with the lord mayor
B	yes
A	yeah very sort of jolly person
C	yeah two folk I know
A	yeah
A	yeah
C	and some chap whose name I always forget who's a lovely boy a Lib Dem
A	well I hope he is actually I
C	mm
B	oh er he thought you
A	yeah
A	thought yeah so I said oh god I said I'd
B	that's
A	rather
B	well oh that's the infection affecting his
A	yeah yeah
B	mind
A	and he wondered if he was on the ship
C	ah
A	yeah
B	ah that sounds quite bad though
A	well I yeah
B	if it's going into his brain like that
A	but you know when
B	oh
A	he wanted to go to sleep
B	well he was
A	he's started the antibiotics yeah
B	so when he's talked to you they would have kicked in maybe
A	well yes
B	already
A	yes he'd had he'd had one
B	so infection
C	what the doctor come round or the or the stash they keep?
A	no the doctor
C	yeah
A	he got any worse
C	they do now
A	and then
B	they won't work
A	antibiotics will not work
B	yes that's what happens isn't it?
A	mm yeah yeah
B	cos he has the urinary infection recurringly
A	he does
B	doesn't he?
A	he does actually
B	yeah
A	and it is avoidable
A	well
C	it's a tube
B	well
A	yeah
B	well it's a matter of cleaning it all the time is it?
A	it is yeah it's supposed to be cleaned morning and night
B	well that'll be why it's happening
A	yeah
B	if it's not cleaned morning and night
A	yeah
B	but er
A	mm
C	twenty-six from fourteen
A	that's quite possible actually
C	yeah only
A	I mean and er
B	and no wi-fi but watches
A	well no but watches sports
B	but yes
A	and particularly cricket and there's usually cricket somewhere in the world
B	so presumably
A	erm
B	they have no computers if they've got no wi-fi
A	no no
B	or mobile phones or
A	they have got mobile phones
B	oh okay yeah
A	they do keep in touch with
B	cos that's different yeah
A	everybody by mobile phones but that's the only I must go up to the loo erm and er that alright? are you quite happy with that? it works anyway doesn't it?
C	uhu
A	and
C	uhu
B	it's good it'll very much serve the purpose
C	does it?
B	it keeps the boobs intact and
C	is it the right size?
B	and stops them moving around
C	is it the right size?
B	I think so because any bigger and then the boobs would start flopping about a bit so I think it has to be really tight it is tight though
C	has to be tight
B	mm?
C	has to be tight cos they're designed for jogging
B	it has to be tight
C	New Balance
B	yeah well it would have to be so tight if I was jogging my god
C	yes
B	my boobs were too booby
C	and they had they had lots of different types some with adjustable straps
B	yeah you see I I
C	but you
B	I don't wanna bother with all that cos it's only for home anyway so I'm not really
C	yeah
B	and if I went out jogging I'd put a T-shirt over the top
C	and they had some that didn't have the the pads just like a
B	yeah
C	like a top
B	has to be mega tight keep them in control
C	and there were bright florescent pink ones
B	yes
C	and the grey one or I could have got you a sort of orangey white stripy one
B	I think you did the right thing by getting grey what I like is erm the ones they're wearing on my New York City Ballet workout but I can't find those anywhere
C	yeah I'd like to buy you a pair of
B	they seem more balletic somehow
C	just a big pair of sweat shorts too
C	it was darling
B	fucking hell
A	beautifully warm
B	mm I've been rearranging the pictures have you seen? not in here but in the
A	no
B	on the landing I put the map of Scotland on
A	ah right yes
B	up there
A	yeah cos that that's Skye that's
B	yeah
A	that needs because that's a genuine thing
B	oh Skye not er yeah
A	yeah Skye
B	the Isle of Skye
A	that's er a very good map
B	erm
A	a very valuable map that is
B	it's a lovely map
A	yeah and I thought it
A	yeah
B	in the hall
A	yes
B	and my
A	cos you actually need to be fairly close to a map
B	well exactly and
A	yeah
B	and it's more of a public area so
A	yeah
B	I want to show it off a bit better
A	yes yeah
B	and my father's painting at the end I think looks really nice
A	yeah good
B	erm
A	yeah
B	from that community market
A	right yes
B	so we did ever so well there cos
A	yeah
B	but I mean and
A	is that just a one-off market or
B	erm I think it's every six months or something like that
A	yeah
B	but local arty people
A	yeah yeah
B	go there and this woman who was just selling stuff
A	yeah
B	er
A	yeah and lovely stuff
B	well she says she's
A	yeah
B	got a whole houseful of stuff and
A	yeah
B	I think she just wants to get rid of it but there was a photographer there and er some painters someone selling cakes
A	right
B	er and someone making who made handmade leather bags who was actually making them there
A	ah ah
B	as well hand-sewing them
A	really? yeah
B	they were really cool looking really nice
A	yeah
B	so yeah we did ever so well cos we got the painting the jug I mean the map the jug and that picture I'm talking about
A	yeah yeah
B	er oh it was such a fun day as well and I
A	and where was it held?
B	erm you know the road where
A	wait a minute
B	yeah so further up along there
A	ah right
B	in a church hall
A	oh right yeah
B	and yeah
A	have you been into the charity shop next to Co-op recently?
B	er next to Co-op?
A	Co-op yes we always call it Co-op
A	yeah
B	erm we're always popping in there so
A	yeah
B	yes
A	yeah yeah
B	yeah
A	it's a it's a good one actually that
B	very good
A	yeah
B	yeah cos we were talking to erm
A	oh yeah I know yeah
B	I've forgotten his name now
A	yes yeah
B	yes
A	mm
B	he likes collecting china as well and
A	does he?
B	things like that yeah
A	mm yeah
B	in fact he wanted the map so we bought the map and told the lady to keep it for us while we got some money out
A	ah right
B	and she had she could have said she could have sold it eight times over because
A	really?
B	so many people wanted it
A	yeah
B	so we were obviously there
A	well you were the first ones yeah excellent
B	well we were there quite early so yeah
A	god that was lucky yes
B	and
A	ah
B	and he wanted it for his pub
A	yeah
B	I know
A	just
B	just off the edge
A	just off you're sort of
B	yeah
A	behind the wood
B	I know
A	not that there's any map
B	we had we
A	yeah
B	we were hopeful that it was an eighteen fifty-three map but it's not
A	mm
B	it's just a print of a map
A	yeah
B	it's not even Victorian it's from
A	yes
B	nineteen ninety-three or something like that
B	but still you'd pay good money for that
A	yes yes
B	on Ebay
A	and it's
B	and the frame as well
A	it's a pretty map and
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	oh it's
A	yeah
B	if you sold that on Ebay
A	mm
B	but yeah anything that was at that
A	and
B	on her stall if you'd put that stall somewhere in Hoxton or Hackney or
A	yeah
B	or Shoreditch it would be just
A	mm
A	yes
B	that was on there
A	yeah yes yeah
B	cos they're all self-conscious about what they sell and
A	yeah
B	they've got the trendy factor and everything
A	mm well the
B	what's a Speed map?
A	I think I'm right
C	what is?
B	is that who did it?
A	Speed was a cartographer who
B	oh yes
A	who mapped it
B	I'm not sure if that one is it might be
A	yeah I thought
B	it's funny to think
A	I thought the Skye map is yes
B	they actually must have walked around to do it
A	yeah I mean the wonderful thing about that Skye map is it's so
B	oh is it?
A	yeah
B	it's not surprising
A	but er
B	if they didn't have erm
A	yeah well yeah you know how they did it
B	planes
A	yeah but er we've got one out in
B	mm
A	seventeenth century
B	mm
A	so er and that's actually worth worth a lot but it's definitely in the right place cos it's in the Peloponnese and
B	well yes absolutely
A	yeah yeah
B	so is that an original map then you're saying that it's
A	the Speed is
B	by yeah
A	by Speed
B	by the one who
A	of what's I think it's
B	but what constitutes an original map? would that be that it's one of the first
A	it was it was published
B	printed published
A	by him at the time
B	so do they do the same thing as books and have editions?
A	it's like a first edition
B	yes exactly
A	yeah yes yes it is oh by the way talking of that
B	oh did you?
A	we bought we bought Number eleven yes
B	oh
A	yeah we were we er
B	is it the paperback
A	and when I bought it
B	or the hardback?
A	no the hardback
B	yeah it's nice
A	and er when we when we bought it we said this is why we are buying it you read this
B	ah
A	and so er
B	yeah
A	and in fact I read it out aloud
C	to whom?
A	to anybody who was listening
B	yeah
A	I mean I was talking to the saleswoman but anybody else around would
B	yeah
A	couldn't avoid it sort of thing
A	yeah
C	fifteen off five
A	yeah well you know two sixes is
C	Mathews
A	oh is it no yeah
B	oh it's
A	I mean the thing about this Twenty Twenty it's actually quite exciting cricket because most cricket is tediously boring actually really cos
B	I'm afraid it just goes over my head
A	it just goes on and on and on
B	well it just goes cricket
A	but this
B	like
A	yeah
B	phew
A	this they've only got
B	over my head doesn't mean anything
A	they've only got to get fifteen runs and they will win
B	I'm afraid that means nothing to me
A	and how many how many how many balls left? fifteen? no no
C	four now
A	four
C	uhu
A	oh well they're not gonna get fifteen they could
C	they've got two thirteen from four
A	yeah if they got two boundaries two
B	doesn't mean
C	big shots
B	doesn't mean anything to me
C	and a little shot they'd win
B	doesn't mean anything to me
B	what's
C	he's well
B	they'll be monitoring him
A	yeah
B	will they?
A	he's taken an Aberdeen Angus steak out of the freezer
B	already
A	yeah
B	yes
A	ah and
B	and how's his ears? I heard that
A	ah well
B	he's got some sort of blockage of some
A	yes yeah
B	nature
A	he got a a very detailed good letter from the
B	mm
A	erm which said a couple of things actually they they did two years ago he had an MRI scan to look at his pituitary
B	yes
A	and the result of that was the pituitary was fine it hasn't
B	oh right it didn't mention that?
A	no but erm the hearing man a few months ago pulled up that MRI scan and saw this thing which could be impacting on his hearing so
B	mm
A	ordered a CT scan and then so when this letter came just literally about three days ago the consultant was saying that both scans show this thing which is identical in both so it hasn't grown
B	good
A	er and he's
B	mm
A	cyst
B	mm
A	erm and that there's nothing else untoward up there that shouldn't be there er he
B	mm
A	it's causing congestion because there's a hole rather than two tunnels
B	mm
A	all the natural vapours and whatever
B	mm
A	don't move because they don't know where to go
B	yes
A	erm and
B	blocking
A	is causing a backlog of blockage
B	mm yeah
A	into the hearing tubes as it were
B	is he going to
A	so
B	get the septum done?
A	well I don't think they can repair the septum
B	oh dear
A	yeah but er he's he's hopeful that they will be able to find something to alleviate the problem so that's
B	mm
A	that's really good news actually
B	to know yes
A	at the minute his hearing is very good except he won't
B	I thought it was really
A	he
B	good
A	yeah
B	last time he was here
A	he yeah yeah
B	but I like over Christmas he couldn't hear
A	yeah
B	what I was saying
A	no
B	but last time he was here
A	he he could
B	he could hear
A	he no you see yeah because that was on the way up to to
C	yes
A	yeah yeah
B	yes they did they won
A	yeah but er yeah so it's yeah it's good
C	just gonna put some supper on
A	so he's he's you know he's in a he's cheerful now cos it must be depressing not being able to hear
B	he is cheerful
A	it's almost as depressing as living with somebody who is
B	well it's the annoyance factor
A	yeah yes yes
B	yeah
A	and it's it's very difficult to avoid
B	the irritation
A	the annoyance
A	yeah yeah
A	yeah but er no he's hearing quite well at the minute but but actually
B	she lip reads doesn't she?
A	she does a lot of lip reading
B	yes
A	yeah yeah
B	I didn't even know
A	yeah
B	she was she couldn't hear
A	yeah yeah
B	very well
A	but she is very deaf but she takes her hearing aids out to use the telephone she's
B	mm
A	she she says she can't possibly use her er yeah
B	yes I think my said a similar thing because
A	yeah
B	of it interferes
A	yeah
B	or there's some kind of
A	yeah
B	thing that happens technically
A	yeah
B	between the
A	yeah
B	phone and the
A	if you've got really bad hearing it it doesn't bother me
B	hearing aid
A	erm the er I can I can have them in and not
B	but you can get a special
A	yeah
B	telephone that's better
A	yes yes yeah
B	that might be worth looking at
A	he could he could get that
B	yeah
A	but
B	right
A	we come back from the cruise
B	yeah that's good
A	er he goes off
B	mm
A	we go back on the Saturday and er he's he sees them on the Monday so
B	so will you be able to keep in touch with people on the cruise?
A	yes there is wi-fi on the ship
B	are you you you are bringing you Ipad to the cruise I take it?
A	oh yes oh definitely
B	yes
A	oh my goodness you'll have photographs all the way my dear
B	yes
A	yes
A	honestly where's his head?
B	he's
A	I mean which way is he facing?
B	he's facing the fire it's hard to tell sometimes
A	god so he's completely twisted his body
B	yeah he does his head's that side
A	because the leg on
B	his head's to the right
A	left there
B	and the legs are
A	and actually that one is actually the right leg isn't it?
B	yeah
A	oh
B	he's very good a yoga
A	and of course he's just so fluffy
B	mm
A	it actually doesn't look as though he's twisted at all from here
A	god
B	yes
A	oh he did
B	didn't you
A	of all the households in London
B	yes
A	oh look at those clouds scurrying past
B	yes yesterday was a lovely day
A	oh yesterday was
B	I got all the washing done yesterday
A	yeah
B	we got all the washing done
A	yeah
B	everything
A	yeah good
B	so it was all good
A	I did some gardening actually which was
B	such a fine day
A	quite funny yesterday cos I got up looked out of the window and it was fine so I thought right I'm going out to garden so I put a wash on went out in the garden came in and took hung the washing out carried on with the gardening finished off the gardening came then thought god it's about time for coffee now hopefully
B	mm
A	cos we
B	yeah
A	came in looked at the clock it was nine
B	oh
B	gosh that's strange
A	I'd got up apparently at about quarter past six but of course it's light it was light and sunny so I started off there
B	yes
A	but I got all the garden done which is the main thing
B	mm
A	doesn't take long cos it's quite small but
B	yeah
A	his legs are still the wrong way round
B	oh I don't know
A	yeah
B	I I mean it's done it's out and I can't worry about it any more
A	yeah yeah
B	so I've done what I can
A	yeah
B	so that's out of the way as far as I'm concerned
A	yeah yeah
B	I don't think er many people are buying it no
A	no
B	I don't I can't think of anything more to do
A	yeah
B	about it so and the more I think oh should should I be doing anything else I get a bit pissed off about it really so
A	yeah
B	I'm sort of not thinking about it
A	yeah
B	very much so yeah I'm afraid there's not a lot to say cos er er
A	yeah
B	it's not what dunno
A	yeah I I've got my my
B	yes
A	CD out in in
B	yes
A	quite a lot in fact I must get I must buy another and have it at
B	well I'll give you another
A	carry it back and forth mm
B	oh that'll be nice
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	and you know here's the opportunity when the car is here
B	yes that will be nice
A	that you don't have to clean that window at all do you?
B	I do we do clean it erm where it gathers at
A	oh right the edges
B	the sides
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	but yeah it's pretty self-cleaning
A	yeah
B	but your technique works really well
A	oh isn't it brilliant?
B	and er
A	yeah
B	that's a really good top tip that is
A	yeah
B	cos it's just enough abrasiveness without scratching it
A	yeah yeah and it just lifts it off
B	you know yeah it does really well
A	like that you you don't have to to rub it
B	yeah
A	in any way
B	just really lightly you can do it and it
A	yeah
B	it
A	is that your CO monitor up there? carbon monoxide
B	mm yes
A	mm
B	only gone off once
A	did it?
B	yeah it did
A	oh
B	have you got a CO monitor?
A	no we don't actually
B	mm
A	no
B	cos they came it came with it
A	yeah I think
B	they brought it
A	I think it's a requirement now actually
B	I think it's a requirement yeah
A	yeah yeah you see I mean we ours was put in
B	before that
A	eight years ago
B	yeah
A	yeah I mean er ours is a five kilowatt one but even then if we'd bought a bigger one you wouldn't have had to have a
B	mm
A	an air vent in those days
B	yeah
A	certainly not when we had our first log burner way back in
B	yeah I often wonder what would have happened if you just lit a fire
A	well
B	in the hole
A	yeah
B	and
A	it would have
B	I mean it would have gone somewhere
A	it would have
B	the smoke
A	gone straight up the chimney because
B	well I would have thought so
A	yeah I
B	yes
A	I dunno if they use the fires there
B	no they don't
A	but I mean
B	no
A	there are fireplaces there
B	yeah exactly
A	if you if you lived there if I'd lived there I would have just
B	mm
A	lit the fire and off it would have
B	I know
A	yeah cos this is what was did at number seventeen
B	oh yes that's right that's I
A	we just lit the fire saw that the smoke went up the chimney and that was it
B	I know I remember
A	yeah
B	doing that way back in
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	in
A	yeah
B	opened up a fireplace and lit it
A	yeah
B	and none of this erm on no it's got to be lined
A	yes
B	and and those rules and
A	yeah yeah
A	I got I mean with a log burner of course
B	it was before the days of all the regulations and
A	you have to have a tube going all the way up
B	yeah
B	but if if you can get
A	if the chimney is there
B	if someone a chimney sweep sticks a great big pole up and it sticks out the top
A	yeah the
B	then that means that you've got a hole
A	yeah exactly
A	and that
B	so it's gonna go up the hole
A	the smoke will go up it
B	I would have thought so
A	yeah yeah
B	and maybe I mean you just wonder whether it's like oh no you're gonna need
A	yeah
B	this as well you know and
A	well I think it
B	a little bit maybe
A	health and safety er you know
B	people milking it
A	at its ridiculous levels because you know the railing round our house is eighty centimetres not round the house on the terrace is eighty centimetres tall and the gaps are about I think twelve centimetres
B	sorry what's
A	er it's eighty the railing
A	you know on on the terrace we had you know
B	yeah
A	we had this stone terrace build
B	mm
A	and I asked for the railing to be eighty centimetres and the gaps to be that because I I didn't want the top of the railing to be you know cut off
A	the view sort of thing you see
B	impinging on the view yeah
A	so that's actually what we do have
B	yes
A	but as the guy who installed it said you know this would not pass
B	really?
A	health and safety
B	mm
A	health as he said it has to be one metre
A	and it
B	yeah
A	it's because babies can put their heads through and
B	but you don't have a baby
A	children yeah exactly and and if somebody brings a baby they can bloody well look
A	look after it
B	yeah
A	you know er it and if a toddlers going to throw themselves over the top of it
A	then it's because somebody's not looking after it
B	yeah
A	who should be and not me but whoever owns it should be looking after it
B	nanny state isn't it?
A	and you see out in
B	yeah
A	erm the drop er down there is a hell of a lot bigger than
B	well
A	the drop over our terrace here
B	I was gonna say your terrace
A	so nobody bothers out there about things
B	how high is your terrace then?
A	well erm
B	it's not high is it?
A	well to
B	but I mean yeah exactly
A	er no er if you're standing the the bottom of the terrace is here
B	yeah
A	you know to eye level
B	that's what I recall
A	yeah whereas in
B	yeah
A	is way above my head and you know
B	mm
A	we've just got this little wall
B	so the baby would survive anyway
A	that we can sit on
A	yes
A	and anyway it shouldn't be out there unescorted so
B	absolutely
A	so er you know he was of that same opinion but he said you know you I just want you
B	yeah
A	to know that er
B	mm
A	it doesn't fall within
B	so what did you do?
A	oh er eighty centimetres tall and
A	exactly what I wanted and to hell with little babies
B	so you thought well sod that
A	falling
A	yeah yes yeah because I mean you read of that oh god that appalling tragedy where those two-year-old twins
B	oh something about it
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	but you know
B	well
A	it is possible that the landlord will be er held responsible legally for renting out a property
B	mm
A	with something insecure in it
B	what happened to them exactly?
A	having well
B	just run me through it
A	er at eight o'clock in the morning
B	mm
A	two two-year-olds wander out of the house and
B	into the
A	went through a a gateway and somehow or other fell into this big tank which had been used by the
B	oh was it was it the garden?
A	it the yeah it was out out of doors yes yeah
B	so they went into the garden and fell into this
A	they went out and then went you know out through and it's only eight o'clock in the morning so you know what are their doing at eight o'clock in the morning? two-year-olds
B	well that's the classic health and safety
A	yeah
B	rule isn't it?
A	yeah
B	that you need to keep an eye on children where there's water concerned
A	yeah and actually you know as I say the owner
B	that's ridiculous
A	but I think that's ridiculous because you know if parents with two not just one but two two-year-olds might have thought well hang on a minute
B	yeah
A	we'd better not rent somewhere
B	completely
A	that has something as lethal as that in the garden
B	that's just bizarre
A	not that it was it it could
B	well oh
A	but you know the parents should have
B	but then
A	if if they insisted on renting it they should have insisted on the thing being drained cos it
B	yeah
A	it wasn't being used
B	yeah
A	er but they should have rented something else
B	but if you take that attitude then before you know it every accident
A	yeah
B	that happens is gonna be the landlord's fault
A	yes
B	that's ridiculous
A	yeah yeah but you know that's that's very much the present day attitude
B	it's like you might as well
A	it's like people slip and fall
B	if you bump into a piece of furniture
A	yeah
B	and it's the fault of the landlord who's
A	yeah
B	furnished the house
A	yeah well
A	if you read cases of people who sue
B	Mcdonald's for scalding themselves
A	or or
B	on a hot cup of tea
A	yeah which they've just bought
B	yeah
A	or slipping on a floor where you know
B	yeah
A	there's a sign well you know where's personal
B	well
A	responsibility?
B	exactly I'm sort of with the personal responsibility
A	yes exactly
B	thing really and I
A	yeah
B	I wouldn't
A	I wouldn't pursue that no quite
B	I wouldn't do it I wouldn't pursue something like that
A	because and if you trip in a pothole
A	you should damn well have seen it
B	yeah I mean within there are some I suppose there's a fine line I suppose if the council had not kept the path or something and
A	yeah
B	there was sticky out bits and you went flying
A	yeah
B	it's a bit annoying
A	yeah
A	yeah yeah
B	that could have been avoided
A	yeah
B	but erm I'd maybe write a letter to them
A	yeah
B	and tell them what happened
A	well what
B	but I wouldn't
A	but I mean just to beware of this
B	try to milk them for
A	yeah no
B	for stuff yeah
A	exactly no no
B	no you wouldn't feel good about it
A	I mean and also no
B	I wouldn't feel good about it
A	no
B	I wouldn't feel good about doing that anyway but yeah
A	I remember
B	I mean the whole
A	it it
B	health and safety
A	yeah yeah
B	courses and really bizarre things I once did this course erm it was online I think it was at
B	like what is wrong with this scene? you know and there's like kind of wires all over the floor and
A	yeah yeah yeah
A	yeah
A	yes yeah
B	er
A	everything
B	you know everything is like
A	yeah mm
A	mm
A	yeah
B	but er yeah it's
A	well I remember years ago when we were
B	mm
A	er on a on a slope it's coming down a hill sort of thing but it it's very very large beautifully kept and I actually twisted my ankle because I happened to walk into a an you know a not a pothole
B	something
A	but just a little indentation
B	okay
A	it wasn't as level as it looked
B	no
A	just because it was you know well that's the sort of situation other people would go off to the council and
B	yeah
A	well it's ridiculous
B	well it's it
A	it's just one's bad luck
B	yeah yeah
A	you know that I'd chosen that little bit of the whole park
B	but then you have these companies that say have you had an accident?
A	yes yes
B	and that's changed the attitude of people
A	yeah it has yeah
B	it's atrocious really
A	yeah yeah
A	erm road patrol that sort of thing
B	mm
A	and er in this particular case er on a motorway there was the most minor of shunts erm
B	yeah
B	mm
A	whatsoever
B	yeah
A	er and none of the traffic had apparently been moving very rapidly er the and then the police is saying to the camera you know because all the people in the
A	and as er this policeman sort of gritting his teeth said
B	mm
A	you know clearly
B	mm
A	they're going to try and sue claim
B	yeah
A	damages and he said because they're complaining of neck ache we have to take it seriously
B	yeah
A	so they had to be put into ambulances and taken off
B	oh how appalling
A	and he said it is
B	yeah
A	cos he said there's actually
B	there's other people who need it
A	nothing wrong with any of them
B	yeah that's atrocious isn't it?
A	yeah
B	mm
A	yeah
B	culture
A	yeah
B	had just laid some concrete and we had this delivery from Tesco and the guy who was delivering didn't know that there was concrete and you could walk past the concrete but he didn't know the concrete was there and I don't think I even knew the concrete was there anyway er he trod in the concrete made a big dent in the concrete
A	oh er
B	yeah and erm
A	really?
B	yeah but I had the
A	and no no warning there saying wet concrete or anything? no
B	no weird
A	yeah
B	I got the sort of some customer relations guy calling me ready for a big argument
A	oh right yeah
B	I said it's not to do with me I mean I just
A	yeah mm
B	I'm quite happy with this with everything it's
A	yes
B	my landlord who's made
A	yeah
B	the complaint
A	yeah
B	and he was all geared up you know for
A	yeah
A	you know you would think that if if
B	well it
A	you at least
B	well
A	and put a notice up saying
B	it was
A	yeah
B	disorganised
A	you'd that he
B	yeah
A	you know he wouldn't have a leg to stand on if he if
B	no but I think that
B	well
A	yeah but that's the tragedy really
B	yeah
A	isn't it?
B	yeah
A	mm
B	but er exactly I mean it
A	yeah
B	has got a bit lost really
A	yeah completely
B	including in medical matters and everything really
A	yeah
B	I I just
A	yeah
B	the way people expect doctors to be when I see news reports of some tragic thing when the baby died because of something or other and the parents are going oh so this doesn't happen again in future and we're suing
A	yeah
B	the NHS for negligence
A	yeah yeah
B	and all that
A	yeah
B	and and I just think well they're not
A	they're not gods
B	they're not gods
A	no
B	and
A	and they are you know they're fallible
B	exactly
A	yeah yeah
B	you can't expect to know
A	yeah yeah
B	everything
A	and actually you know but
B	and and you know and the misdiagnosis thing you
A	get it right but did you know
B	frankly I wouldn't expect them to get it right I just
A	yeah
B	think that
A	yeah
B	they're there to help
A	yeah
B	and
A	yeah
B	they know stuff
A	yeah
B	but it's
A	to put in
B	somehow let them know
A	or to ask the right questions
B	or to er yeah
A	or give the right information
B	exactly and and I do you hear people go oh and they said this that and the other and
A	yeah
B	and then they gave me some pills and blah blah blah or that
A	yeah
B	there's a kind of passivity there
A	yeah yes yeah
B	that is
A	yeah
B	just plainly
A	yeah
B	where has that
A	and you know
B	come from?
A	yeah the and the challenge you know the question that should be asked of these complainants is you know how would you like to have a job in which
B	yes under the pressure where
A	every ten minutes
B	yeah
A	somebody is gonna pop through the door
B	yeah
A	and
B	exactly
A	and require your opinion every ten minutes that's
B	and present with some some
A	six times an hour
B	symptoms
A	wham wham
B	that could either be flu
A	that you know nothing about
B	or could be meningitis
A	yeah and you know nothing about them till they've walked through
B	yeah yeah I it's it's a
A	incredible really
B	ridiculous expectation
A	mm
B	to put on anybody really and and the fact that someone can then sue them for
B	I mean how about just realising that
B	within reason but that is life
A	yeah life is a lottery
A	yeah
B	but especially it's it's the
A	yeah
B	bad about that
A	yeah yeah
B	now I know it's terrible
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	I'm not I'm not
A	yeah
B	demeaning the tragic element
A	yeah yeah
B	of it all but it's like
A	yeah
B	their
A	mm
B	emotion of it
A	yes
B	spread everywhere and like
A	yeah yeah
B	kind of
A	another area you know schools
B	yes
A	schools are supposed to
B	mm
A	education in every single field you know sex education for one surely that's should be the parental responsibility
B	mm yeah
A	not that all parents
B	yeah
A	are very good at it but then neither neither necessarily are schools
B	no
A	and the the whole thing that schools should be
B	telling them
A	teaching them this that and the other
B	teaching it yes
A	schools should be teaching them erm
B	or morals
B	mm mm
A	as Maggie Thatcher years and years ago said there should be five things in a school reading writing
B	yeah
A	writing arithmetic right and wrong
B	yes
A	you know
B	mm
A	but er you know parents have a er a lot that they should be doing about right and wrong and about erm morals and such like but erm and er and apparently lots of kids now absolutely lots of kids are arriving at school aged five not potty trained
B	I've heard of that
A	and can't can't read
B	yes and then they expect that
A	and can barely speak
B	someone else is
A	because they don't speak to anybody
B	gonna
A	and er
B	teach them
A	yeah
B	the parents think that someone else is gonna
A	yeah it's up to it's it's up to the school
B	go through the whole
A	yeah and maybe not
B	thing
A	five when they get there but if they're going to a
B	a nursery
A	a nursery school which most of them do
B	it's the nursery thing but I heard that
A	you know there they are three four five
B	yeah
A	coming up five
B	they can't take them I don't think they can take them
A	yeah

A	she was in a strop because we'd miss-scored
C	she'd been in a strop for almost
C	over a day
B	what over the last game?
C	well
A	because we'd
C	she had won it and then I realised I'd made an error scoring and in fact she'd only drawn

C	and then I think
B	ah
C	it was the very next game the same thing happened

B	oh
A	of course
B	mm
A	you know which is nothing to do to me at all of course
B	yeah
A	how much did you
C	sixteen well what it will be is that they haven't sold out
A	yeah
C	all the expensive er
A	yes
C	and they're harder to sell so you put someone up
A	yes
C	then you can er offer the smaller berths
A	yeah
C	at a cut price deal for someone
A	yeah
C	and they're more likely to take it
A	yeah yeah exactly so you know we've got this cabin which is
B	now you can sit in the cabin on a sofa

A	yeah
B	as soon as it's
A	yeah
B	a little bit er difficult
A	one two three four five
C	yeah
A	which for vowels is not too bad oh no
B	oh was I meant to add them? sorry
A	yeah yeah
B	I didn't add I just put the thing in
B	oh okay
A	and make an
B	yeah
A	in
B	good strategy
A	or or if
B	oh I can do that
C	well Z O is a word or Z A and then if you put another letter you're
A	but not er if if Z O is have you
C	no but
A	oh right yes you don't have to go over there
B	no I can I can make in
A	Z I isn't a
C	actually I think I don't think
B	no I don't but I can I could make in there
C	uhu
B	but then that just means he could put something
A	yeah there's no point
B	there
A	yes yeah
C	don't just block it
A	no
B	yeah
C	for the sake of it cos you're actually battling mum
B	erm oh hold on just a reminder of the rules do you still get the
C	no
B	double
A	no
B	if you add something
C	no
B	no
C	they only count the first time they're covered
B	no
B	oh
A	see you want to go somewhere like here in that case because at least you'll get a double word
B	yeah
A	if you
B	but I've got an S
B	do quite a few things
B	well I could add an S there
A	you could which gives you quite a good score
B	yeah it does
A	and if you've got an O
B	yeah
A	you could make so so at least you'd get
B	zippo?
A	no no S there
B	yeah oh I see
A	and so
B	oh right
A	so you get this word
B	yeah
A	as well as that word
B	well I don't have an O
A	no
B	I'm gonna do that anyway
A	oh you don't have a vowel yeah
B	no
A	yeah well yeah quite that's
B	fifteen
A	fifteen so
B	that's a bit naughty maybe he should try a little bit harder
B	erm where's
A	I think he could because he's actually hearing
B	well I think he's hearing
A	perfectly well actually and if he's
B	yeah
A	if he phoned up and gave you that information
B	perfectly well he did as well
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	sorry?
A	he he did
C	whose go? zips?
A	well you can't do much
B	it's your go
A	if you've only got if you haven't got any vowels
B	oh typical
A	za? what's za?
C	it's short for pizza it's a horrible horrible word
A	and it's allowed?
C	yeah eleven thirty-three plus six thirty-nine
B	yeah
A	we we actually think
C	can I have the letters
A	we think that
B	no I just
A	that we don't use
B	I I don't think that words that you don't use should be allowed
A	that's what the rest of the
B	I don't I'm surprised that they are or
A	I I mean that za
B	they whoever it is
A	is yeah
B	official Scrabble board of
A	exactly
B	erm
A	accept this it ruins the game
B	yeah
A	in a way
C	I'd be happy if they didn't accept that particular word it's it's
B	well it
C	horrid
B	does ruin the game really but
C	and no one uses it
B	er yeah
A	well you shouldn't put it down you're honour bound not to put it down
B	when are you gonna say I'm going for a za?
A	exactly
C	yeah it's horrible
A	I think our rule should be that unless you actually would be capable of using the word
B	yeah
A	you shouldn't be allowed it
B	exactly
C	well I know what they all mean
A	yeah I know you know who they mean but
A	you don't use it
B	yeah
C	I just did
A	however I know you did and you're not gonna take it off
B	yeah but only in the context of playing Scrabble
A	yeah
B	and that's just too limited
C	a little mini sofa would look nice there wouldn't it darling?
B	it would be lovely
C	and in summer we could put that back there if we wanted
B	I don't mind actually I'm open to all possibilities I like it here
A	yeah I think it keeps the shape of the room er a rather nicer shape
C	just mixing it up
A	yeah yeah
B	yeah it's
C	keep them guessing
A	yeah
B	we can change it it's changeable
A	I mean it's such a lovely room actually yeah right now wait a minute now
B	it's my turn I think is it my turn?
C	no it's me
B	oh okay there was I all under pressure
C	did you get a vowel darling?
B	no
C	ah
C	oh dear
B	it doesn't make any difference
C	well there's a nice E right next to the double
A	I'm trying to
B	but if you're good at anagrams you're better at Scrabble you should I mean I think practicing anagrams would be a good accompaniment to Scrabble anagrams in their own right
C	mm
B	cos this is like doing an anagram
A	mm
B	take as long as you like
B	cos erm really
A	four five six
B	oh I quite liked
A	seven fourteen
B	mm no too dark
C	no no I I think
A	what's he doing now?
C	he's sort of upside down
B	oh
A	and such
A	oh well he was upside with a
B	he was twisted
A	with a twist earlier on
B	yeah
C	yes he's getting very hot
B	there was one half of his body one direction and the other half in the opposite direction
C	wean?
A	yeah yeah
C	mm okay that's
A	you've got a tough job actually oh you that's not bad at all
B	double letter
A	yeah
B	score so
C	well
A	two three four five six ten
B	four five six seven eight nine ten yeah that's it
C	cos you don't have any vowels at all do you dear?
B	no
A	uhu that's right yeah

C	three four five six seven eight nine eighteen
A	yeah well or taken them out yes

A	that looks gorgeous
B	I got distracted
B	look the T-shirt but I want to actually I want to repeat this T-shirt by unstitching it and seeing what the pattern is
A	where did you get it?
B	from Zara and I can never find exactly
C	it's your go
B	the right neckline and
A	yeah
B	this has got it but if I unstitch it I will lose this one
A	yeah

A	it's a lovely one I love sloppy T-shirts like that that
B	yeah it's exactly the right shape
A	yeah it is yeah
B	I need to erm
A	would you have to unpick it to take it
B	I think so cos it's not as easy as just looking at it is it? it never is and it's got that bit
A	no yeah
B	mm
B	wish I had a spare one that I could unpick
C	it's your go my love
B	oh no
B	if I only had an E I could do some more
A	are the neighbours still nice and quiet
C	yeah pretty quiet considering they've got a wee kid
A	yeah
C	haven't really don't hear them at all do we
B	no
A	and they don't play blaring loud music like when you first moved here the people who were there?
C	well they had little kids that played computer games
A	yeah
C	a bit loud but
B	okay
A	no no that's the trouble isn't it I mean at least that's on a double so so that's four
A	five six seven eight
B	yeah
A	mm and actually you could have got the same score writing mid
B	yeah
A	but it would have opened that
B	I yeah
A	to him which you don't want
B	yeah
A	which you haven't opened this
A	it's not an easy
C	no it's alright

A	twenty-four twenty-five twenty-six twenty-seven twenty-eight twenty-nine
C	aye
A	yeah thank you dear
B	uhu
B	mm
C	and then he comes to sit up there unless he thinks it's supper
A	he knows
C	of course
A	he says there are too many people there oh look at that now what's he going to oh oh
B	he's been scratching a lot there
C	don't
A	he wants the door open doesn't he?
C	he's negotiating a barrier which
B	mm looking a bit raw
C	looking very tender
B	mm
A	he wasn't scratching up there he was scratching lower down actually
C	no
A	yeah
C	it's gone oh dear maybe slip him a little antihistamine darling
B	mm
A	we could do all both of them today has he eaten
B	has he had supper?
A	oh
B	two options for scoring six
A	well yeah
B	well that's one
A	what have you got?
B	then there's
A	you and what vowel do you have?
B	E
A	just one E yeah yeah I think I would have handed them all in by now let's see now mm
B	I could do fen or I could do rider
A	yeah mm fen would be less damaging for the point of view of his lordship erm E
B	well I that's what I thought but I don't think there is
A	I think there is you know
B	ven? what would that mean though?
A	well I'm not certain but
B	it's possible
A	yeah
B	if there is a a word
A	is is a word
B	that's four it's it's still not very good scoring anyway
A	four five
B	triple letter
A	fen I'd is fen a single the a singular word
B	four five six seven oh yeah eight
A	or is it just fens? yeah
B	two more
A	yeah
B	the then
A	yeah you need two vowels don't you? yeah
B	yeah I need a a riven
A	yeah it you know I think
B	I need an I
A	if I didn't put that I would have handed that
B	yeah
A	whole thing in actually missed a go
B	right
A	if you hand them any number in
B	yeah
A	from one to all of them you do miss a go but sometimes it pays to do that because you you get rid of
B	yeah
A	a letter combination that you can't use and dump that letter combination on other people who are gonna pick it up at some stage or other really er you really do need a balance of
B	mm
A	of the two
B	yeah if I put rider then there's a triple word score there
A	yes yeah
B	but if I put fen it's only triple letter score
A	yeah
B	he could do but he's got triple score up there but at least it's not triple word score
A	no
B	so I'll do that
A	I er well
B	yeah
C	oh well that's a bit better
B	well an E should be er useful though
A	well no no
B	but I can blame the letters as well
A	you haven't you you you haven't got
A	I would
B	I'd still be just as bad
A	yeah
B	if I had great letters though so
A	yeah
A	I've had at various times in fact when I put beep down I could have actually put devour
B	yeah
A	D E V O U R
B	oh that would have been clever
A	but it it didn't get me as much as this and
B	yeah
B	mm
A	better because a B was on a double if not a triple
B	yes
A	er double
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	well yes
A	you you know
B	well it skews the whole thing for ever more as soon he does that
A	cos none of the rest of us know these
B	well
A	two-letter words
B	yeah it's not fair is it really?
A	I mean I suppose in a sense we we should use them but
B	well we could use them
A	we but you know we
B	we have the right to
A	the rest of the family would like to say well hang on a minute we'll have only the
B	yeah
A	common two-letter words
B	needs to be one or the other
A	in at on up
B	doesn't it? yeah
A	yeah
B	either we all learn them
A	yeah and that's I mean the word za
B	and I don't I don't want to learn those words
A	is
B	I mean I'm
A	unacceptable
B	I'd prefer to learn a word that you're actually going to use not
A	yeah
B	one that's
A	yeah
B	you're not never gonna use
A	I think my rule would be it it can only be a two-letter word if it's a preposition
B	uhu
A	er you know which is in
B	yeah
A	erm if not a preposition but that'll do but you know the words that we actually use
B	well exactly and it's more useful
A	I mean even the word er pi
B	if it's words you actually use
A	P I is an okay word actually cos we
B	you could learn something from a word
A	yeah
B	even if you don't know what it means if it's something that you're likely to use then you're gonna learn something
A	you've just gone with fen
B	yeah it's
A	we could each have an an extra go
B	yeah
A	I'll have a go and
A	then you have a go and then and then not that we'd be anywhere near where he is he's
B	no and he'd still win
A	yeah but I mean he's
B	he's a very
A	thirty er
B	he is so clever isn't he?
A	thirty ahead of me
B	how did he get so clever?
A	ah
B	is that cos of you?
A	he is a clever lad actually
B	mm
A	yeah oh he's got a very good brain
B	yeah but cleverness did it come
A	yeah yeah
B	was he born clever or
A	well
B	do you think that it's
A	no I think you you're born with a
B	you're born
A	with a brain that is capable of
B	of
A	many pathways
B	certain things yes
A	as it were it's it er
B	yeah
A	a brain that's able to think
B	mm
A	if that's makes sense
B	so
A	er but you know he was a very late reader
B	was he?
A	oh god when he was five six I used to sit you know those flashcard things?
B	yes
A	well we used to sit down there's a flashcard that's got
A	three letters on it cat dog whatever there's a great pile of of sweets bribes if he gets it right
A	and you know he looks at it then he looks round the room and he says
B	ah he's
A	he says
B	not interested
A	caterpillar or something you know and then and then he'll get up and wander around and say you know alligator or you know words that are not down there
A	so yeah
B	actually
A	but then then when he was and in fact in his primary school it which was the original infant school it only had three classrooms each of which had an entrance to the outside it it was a Victorian building
B	yeah
A	it was absolutely wonderful and quite frequently I had to collect him to take him to a hospital appointment cos of course he was in and out of school like nobody's business but
B	yeah
A	writing away and then you'd see one tot wandering around the classroom
B	oh and it was him
A	and there was our
B	mm
A	and he didn't go anywhere without a book in his pocket
B	and that's been the same ever since
A	and that's actually when he started to read so I don't actually know when he went from cat
B	yes
A	to
B	well
A	to to reading he just
B	but you
A	suddenly
B	yeah
A	he suddenly saw
B	well
A	the purpose of it
B	yeah and in his own time and in his own
A	yeah
B	of his own volition
A	his own way
A	yes exactly
B	yes
A	and er and then off off he went actually
B	yeah that's how it happens
A	yeah yeah
B	I had terrible trouble learning to tell the time I don't know why but I had this big learning difficulty to do with telling the time and I remember once just sitting there in an
B	and there it was
A	really? yeah
A	yeah
B	mind you
A	yeah yes
B	but most other kids had learnt how to do it by the time
A	yeah yeah
A	but obviously
B	I but you know given my own
A	yeah
B	you know it's like er I wasn't gonna be hurried cos my dad er had me trying to teach me
A	yes you should know
B	you know
A	the time by the time you're five
B	er er no it wasn't you know and he was getting really kind of worked and
A	that doesn't help of course
B	I could feel him getting worked up as well
A	yeah yeah
B	and getting all worried that I wasn't you know
A	that you were retarded
B	and it made it even worse yeah
A	yeah
B	but you know on my own I did in the end but it was just
A	yeah
B	oh yeah that's past and that's to and then there's the
A	yeah
A	yes and the big hand is this
B	yeah
A	and the little hand is the other
B	exactly
