A	soup?
B	right
A	Parmesan and this is er garlic and herb er something
A	let me see
B	ah
A	soft cheese
B	ah
A	no not really
B	mhm
A	you could buy a trolley full of fresh fruit and vegetables straight from the orchard
B	mm
A	for about ten euros
B	mm
A	I just don't like it
B	the one the indoor one?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	so
B	for the meats and that it's not great
A	do you shop there?
B	yeah
A	yeah so I buy most of my vegetables from supermarkets
B	mm
A	it's the
B	the farmers
A	the producers
B	well that's why in my family there used to be about eight farms
A	hm
B	and they just couldn't keep up with the prices that people were asking for meat and things like that
A	yeah
B	it was ridiculous
A	it's such a shame isn't it
B	mm
A	mm
B	before
A	are you sure that's warm enough?
B	the soup? Yeah
A	yeah
B	it is for me
A	yeah?
B	mhm
A	okay
A	yeah
B	mm
A	obviously in Spain that was easier cos it was fantastic weather and conditions for
B	mm
A	they put
B	they don't have houses that have gardens though do they?
A	mm
B	mm
A	unless you lived in the outskirts
B	oh yeah
A	and I've heard in in like dodgy areas of Birmingham as well they've got er there's some charity that that um organizes allotments for the neighbours and gets them together to work together
B	really?
A	problems with gang-related issues and things
B	mm
A	they've got an objective
B	yeah
A	it's it encourages a lot more
B	oh that's a good idea
A	my grandad used to have an allotment
B	my dad does
B	out of the countryside but you can't take the countryside out of the boy
B	my dad his job now is he retired from office work and he's gardening as a sideline
A	cool
B	just um a couple of gardens a week to top up his pension
A	mhm
B	and to be honest I don't think he'll ever give it up
A	well it's nice to
B	mm
A	especially if you can eat them after
B	and he has his allotment
A	uh-huh
B	and um still said there wasn't that much luck
A	hm
B	and he keeps bringing things over
A	what does he grow?
B	this year he had some beetroot
A	aw
B	so about fifty percent of the flowers for the wedding were
A	oh they were lovely
B	from my dad's allotment
B	yeah
A	they haven't got a story behind them
A	aw lovely
B	what was really good
A	sorry?
B	what was really good  as well the place had sunflowers as their decorations
A	ah
B	as a theme kind of for my wedding
A	destiny
B	in their restaurant part
A	lovely
B	so it was really cool
A	I saw you put up some more photos of the wedding the other day
B	oh I got round to doing it at last
A	just
B	oh thank you
A	aw
B	it was really nice
A	it was all a bit crazy there for a while
B	it's no it's not a relaxed sort of thing
A	well there's just so much to organize isn't there
B	mm
A	mm this is good with Parmesan on it
B	the salad?
A	mm
B	Parmesan's lovely
A	so when he grew his beetroot
B	mhm
A	because the beetroot that you get in cans I guess that's all been treated and prepared no? So how did  how did  he eat his beetroot? Or how did he prepare it?
B	er you can just have it boil it or um Mihal wanted me to make Polish soup which is made of beetroot
A	oh
B	borscht
A	is that like borscht?
B	mhm
A	oh
B	red borscht
A	mhm
B	you know like using especially the winter food in Poland
A	is it all the dodgy parts of the animal like pigs trotters and?
B	there's one soup oh what's that one called? I've forgot what that's called
A	urgh
B	do you know what I mean?
A	no I didn't know there was a hairy bit in the intestine
B	well it looks like hairy bit
B	it's got like um all little tentacle thingies
A	oh lordy
B	yep
A	stomach soup
B	mm
A	really?
B	mm
A	how far  how far  down the intestine do they go to find it?
B	I don't know if it's the
A	uh-huh
B	I'm guessing
A	but I imagine that the stuff that already passes through that part of the intestine
B	mhm
A	is no longer food
A	that's probably why it stinks
B	just let's not think about this
A	it stinks the house out
B	I have eaten it
A	not a lunch conversation topic
B	someone's going getting tired aren't you
A	is he sleepy?
B	he's sleepy but he's fighting it
B	mm
A	is the sun bothering you?
B	me? No
A	no?
B	no
A	I know
B	I'm
A	Don't you worry
B	oh yeah
A	maybe I'll um arrange to meet you every day
A	just so the sun comes out
B	and have some sun
B	mm
A	it's amazing
B	hm
A	and
B	yeah I can imagine that the
A	I think it's a great idea to have a glass roof on a kitchen but if you have a glass
B	it's not? mm
A	no I think it's just single glazed
B	it's got plants coming in
A	it's got what sorry?
B	plants coming in
A	oh yeah
A	I could grow some salad up there
A	could be a greenhouse
B	mhm
A	isn't it
B	be ideal
A	that's not a bad idea
B	any plants that don't mind direct sunlight
A	hm
B	mm
A	is he going to sleep? Aw
B	this is good because I'm trying to get out of the habit of breastfeeding to sleep because it's gonna be a problem if I'm not there
A	bless you
B	bless you
A	mm
B	how to fall asleep
A	mm
B	or helped over that kind of that I dunno threshold to sleep or something
A	mm
B	Cos they just seem so reluctant sometimes to go to sleep
B	and the crying out method that says
A	what's that?
B	just like leave them to cry so they cry them they tire themselves out and go to sleep
A	mm
A	eighteen-month-old daughter
B	mm
A	um or at
B	mhm
A	if she doesn't go back she just er
B	mhm
A	and screams and screams and screams  until she  until she vomits
B	yeah
A	aw
B	I haven't done it since
A	well she said all the books say leave them they'll get used to it
B	yeah
A	you can't always do what a book says because
B	it doesn't work for every child as well
A	yeah
B	is different
A	hm
B	Cos they say it affects their if you try it too young it affects their um confidence
A	aw
B	and being like um cos there's er the people who think wear your baby and then other people think like try to separate from the baby
A	that's interesting
B	mm
A	it's difficult to know what they're gonna be like
B	yeah
A	mm
B	the hand in the mouth or tired is rubbing the ear
A	really?
B	rubbing the eyes
B	depending on again baby
A	mm
B	and they'll be less communicative and
A	oh right
B	it's so many people say different things
A	yeah
B	it's really hard
A	it must be worrying like when there's no little instruction manual that comes with your baby
B	yeah
A	you must be able to interpret his signals better than any expert could
B	mm
A	have you ever had any problems out in public breastfeeding? I know that
B	I haven't but my dad said he was with his friend who said to dad to tell the lady to
B	mm
B	no my dad went my dad at first I think he was more to that way of thinking but having me preach to him
B	so he wasn't very happy that his friend had said that
A	well it is completely natural isn't it
B	really?
A	yeah
B	there was a big thing when I was in Granada about um domestic violence
A	mhm
B	there were all the
A	huh
B	and he followed her after
A	oh no
B	and killed her in um
A	oh my life
B	in the entrance to her apartment building
A	that what he was also invited on the chatshow but she was there?
B	he had  he had  gone on there saying he wanted to surprise his lady and and
A	oh dear
B	so she'd been brought on not knowing who was who'd asked her onto the show
A	mm
B	I'm not breastfeeding you
A	and so she didn't know that she thought that it was about domestic violence or something?
B	no she thought she wasn't sure who had it was like this person wants to surprise you
A	mm
B	must have not crossed her mind
A	well that's the problem with reality TV isn't it
A	ooo
B	ooo
A	what is it? Ooo
A	grab it  grab it  No I don't wanna grab
A	then again thinking about you know when you fall asleep
B	mm
A	there's this kind of halfway between waking and sleeping
B	mm
A	that actually if you're a baby and you don't know what it is it actually might be quite
B	mm
A	to
B	yeah
A	I mean
B	to
B	and I do it and then there is a thing like if he's falls asleep on me then when I put him down and he wakes up it's like huh argh
A	aw
B	especially if it's somewhere different that he's not used to being
A	mm
B	like if he wakes up in his cot it's like okay I know this place
B	but if he wakes up in the dark cos he'll have fallen asleep in the light and I'll put him in the room
B	that could must be quite scary
A	what are their memories their short-term memory like memories like at this age? So if he falls asleep in the while it's day
B	mm
A	and he wakes up when it's night will he remember that when he
B	yeah I think so
A	mm
B	I think their short-term memory's quite good
A	aw
B	and shy
A	ah not too far away then
B	no
B	he's apart from his gardening
B	I forget I'm so used to him being there and not doing anything
B	that you can grab them now
A	very tough
B	and it was two weeks after coming home
A	aw
B	yeah he came over every day and cooked for me
A	aw
B	he's a very sweet man
A	and where does your sister live?
A	ah
B	after they made redundant
A	oh gosh yeah
B	I've seen her quite frequently
A	how's she  getting on?
B	okay yeah
A	oh good
A	that's a very good plan
B	mm
A	urgh it really sucks your soul out
B	it does
A	urgh
B	I've been really lucky with interviews
B	and that was it
A	what was your interview with
B	that was more formal to be honest
B	Cos you know what they're like
B	Cos I I think
A	mm
B	I've no idea
A	oh what's wrong? What's the matter? There you go
B	bit tired aren't you
A	aw
B	mhm
A	he did it over the phone
B	did he?
A	and I think he was desperate
A	and it was
B	yeah
A	and I think he was that desperate that he'd already seen my CV and er the phone conversation I thought was an interview and he was just like this is what you're going to be doing du du du du luh
B	it was the same um I had an interview before that another um education provider
B	than about what I had done
A	what's the matter  what's the matter? Oh you want to be in the conversation don't you
B	and to eat the worm
A	you suck on the
B	mm
A	yeah I think he worked on the pre-sessional for a bit
B	mhm
A	and then was teaching
B	alright darling
B	got to try and get to sleep
A	then I think he was teaching some academic English during the year
B	mm
A	and then he got made
B	ah
B	maybe
A	oh er
B	mm
A	looks a bit like Father Christmas
B	I think so yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
A	but I think he works at Keele University during the year
B	or said he had done
A	ah
B	so they were gonna be doing extra extra lessons
B	he's a bit wet now
A	are you getting wet?
B	very
A	have you got do you want me to grab something?
B	I've got it all in er I'm very well prepared
A	yes
B	got everything in there
A	very organized mummy
B	um no
A	are you sure?
B	yeah
A	huh
B	it does
A	I like anything sweet
B	I wasn't sure like if you were like liked toffee and chocolatey kind of things or more like that
A	I think you made a good decision
B	oh
A	aw
B	there was a chocolate brownie dessert and I wasn't sure which one to go for
A	aw
B	oh well very nice of you to make lunch
B	it was lovely
A	maybe I'll make some veggie soup for you one day
B	yeah
A	not long
B	mhm
A	mhm
B	sort of thing
A	cool
B	yeah
A	bit of avocado here
A	bit of ground up meat there
B	Cos apparently like eggs and milk are the things that they tend to have any reaction to
A	really
B	be fine
A	mm
B	to to for eggs to be one of the last things that you introduce when their stomachs are a bit more developed
A	maybe it takes more digestion to
B	maybe yeah
A	to process protein
B	meat
A	oh oh oh
B	meat was included in you know from very near the beginning
A	mhm
B	vegetable really
A	what kind of meat does it suggest?
B	it had little things like spaghetti bolognese
A	oh
B	and things like that
A	huh you're going to eat spaghetti
B	mm
A	mhm
B	and being so worried
A	oh
B	baby food with lumps in
B	and it was like can we give him that  can we give him that? Then started giving it him and he was huh
A	huh argh
B	and we were like oh my God we killed him we're killing him
B	me and my sister were so stressed
B	Cos neither of us had look looked after a baby baby before
B	that's anything you know less than a
A	oh
B	mm
A	are you tired?
B	he's very
B	aren't you
