A	that's the one on the table
B	where did the other one go?
A	that is mysterious I'm sure
B	maybe somebody's taken it
A	possible
B	yes I don't know if it works though I don't know how to turn it on
A	mm
B	mm
A	that is strange isn't it?
B	yeah there were so definitely two
A	yeah
B	oh here it is it was hidden amongst the colour

A	lighter please
B	lighter
A	thank you
B	smuggled them in from France got them
A	did you?
B	cos we drove back
A	oh that's cool
B	filled the car up
A	I thought you were allowed to bring in beer though
B	yeah I think you are I don't know what the limit is it's probably
A	loads isn't it?
B	is it?
A	yeah
B	in spirits too?
A	oh I don't know about spirits
B	oh you you you can buy spirits
A	but it's massive isn't it? cos people bring like trailers?
B	that's true what's the rule? it has for personal use which this is so it's
A	well yeah it is
B	yeah
A	mm that's nice that Hoegaarden
B	yeah I quite like a oh
A	what are you looking for?
B	I was doing a rum and Coke I just forgot what I was doing
A	oh ah
B	well I thought you were taking a picture of your food
A	no I'm not that bad
B	looking for the mug the green one
A	a green mug I think
B	ah
A	you put it in the fridge
B	what's in there? oh my Coke from this morning's there
A	ah so perfect
B	no cos it doesn't freeze
A	mm
B	liquid
A	really?
B	yeah it goes kind of
A	but
B	syrupy it goes more viscous
A	ah
B	but it doesn't freeze
A	but wine would blow up wouldn't it?
B	yes because it would freeze
A	ah cos it's not a high enough
B	not strong enough
A	alcohol content
B	yeah
A	so what's that cut off point?
B	I dunno I only do sort of forty percent type spirits
A	oh that's really clever mm
B	and that's usually fine it's nice cos then you don't need ice
A	oh that's a good point
B	and I quite like it
A	that is clever
B	mm
A	right
B	bon appetit
B	oh oh yeah I've got some sake too
A	mm mm nice
B	mm
A	very nice mm
B	mm
A	mm so was the lasagne the no cook sort? I mean not no
B	yeah pre
A	no boil sort?
B	no no precook
A	no precook
B	which I think I is standard in the UK
A	is it?
B	I think so
A	mm that's annoying when you have to do that stage
A	mm
B	and I bought the lasagne sheets in Korea
A	mm
B	and it mine was a disaster cos I didn't precook the lasagne
B	I didn't even know there was an option and then it was all really hard
A	so everyone made a different sort of lasagne?
B	yeah we had two
A	that's quite cool
B	two or three different ones
A	yeah that's cool
B	mm
A	mm very nice
B	mm
A	mm it's nice so that you boiled first?
B	yeah
A	the cubes to make them come back to leaves
B	mm
A	mm clever
B	just for five minutes
A	that is clever and then you did it in layers?
B	layers yeah
A	mm
B	and used one box which is perfect
A	mm
B	layer it
A	mm
B	but you don't have to do the well the sauce was mixed with the beef
A	oh okay you mixed it?
B	yeah you can you can mix the spinach in too but I didn't just layered it
A	no I just layer it yeah
B	erm yeah and that's it
A	mm
B	but only layered so you ensure each lasagne layer has er liquid
A	yeah
B	so the
A	mm mm yeah the spinach is nice
B	mm
A	yeah it's a good idea keeping spinach in the freezer like that
B	I know cos I wouldn't well actually we do often buy bags but
A	mm
B	nice to just keep some reserve and
A	mm
B	frozen fruit
A	pick the fruit?
B	mm like blackberries and then freeze them which is quite good in the autumn
A	mm
B	yeah
A	yeah mum does that
B	oh does she?
A	yeah she still does that I like doing that and they've had quite a lot of soft fruit this year so they've frozen some of that
B	mm oh they've picked that from the garden?
A	yeah some of it
B	that's good did they? some
A	some of it they didn't pick
B	just a waste
A	mm
B	oh such a shame
A	mm
B	they should put a poster up on like
A	but they don't like people
B	no they don't no
B	such shame though cos like somebody would and that's really good for a family
A	yeah it's true
B	mm
A	mm
B	and then sell it
A	I don't think he likes that idea either
B	no people
A	yeah
B	oh I don't like waste though
A	next year when I'm there
B	yeah you can
A	then I'll do it
B	you could organise
A	yeah
A	no
A	especially food
B	mm
A	they're saying in the paper I think that one I was reading today yeah about Britons being the most wasteful nation for throwing away fruit and vegetables and we throw away like a quarter or a third or something
B	that's terrible
A	mm
B	that's really bad
A	mm
B	every time I throw something away which isn't that often I feel really guilty even milk cos it's almost as cheap to buy twice as much as
A	yeah and now you know what to do with milk
B	yeah
A	and you can make cheese
B	or freeze half of it yeah
A	or freeze it yeah
B	freezer's good
A	and the other thing is to make soup isn't it? out of any
B	old veg and
A	leftover veg
B	yeah it's fine you can
A	or bread you can
B	oh
A	add bread to thicken it
B	to soup
A	instead of potato
B	oh
A	so that's what
B	that's quite a good one
A	mm
B	stale rather than mouldy
A	cos obviously it's like yeah
B	yeah
A	it's flour isn't it? so it's gonna have
B	mm
A	exactly the same effect
B	that's true then it's got some substance to it
A	yeah
B	that you
A	and just add it at the end and then blend it so you get a smooth consistency
B	oh okay
A	so you don't need to cook it
B	that's good
A	mm
B	yeah I can imagine we waste so much part of it I think I don't think it's good all these multi buy offers at the supermarket
A	no
B	it just encourages you to buy too much
A	mm
B	I think it would be better if everything just had flat prices
A	this geography teacher I work with cos geography teachers are often a bit sort of left leaning but he like I had to observe and teach he was my mentor
B	oh
A	and I remember him telling a story about how he'd gone to the supermarket to buy a bag of potatoes and as he got to the checkout the checkout girl said oh they're buy one get one free so you you can go and get another one from erm
B	mm
A	and bring it back and he said yeah but
B	don't need another one
A	I don't need two I only need one
B	doesn't mean anything
A	and she's like no but it's free so you can get two and he's like yeah but I don't need two I only need one
B	mm
A	I can only eat one
B	uhu
A	and she said yeah but it's free
B	oh well
A	she couldn't like
B	she didn't get it
A	get it yeah although I thought like he hadn't really thought that through cos what he should have done is like given it to his neighbour or
B	yeah yeah yeah that's right
A	anything yeah it wouldn't really matter
B	mm
A	yeah but we're not very good
B	that's
A	with our neighbours in this country
B	no we're not
A	that's been the nice thing about where I am I've got to know quite a lot of people through that walking group
B	oh yeah yeah it's good to do a local club
A	not literally neighbours but
B	no but
A	within five minutes' walk
B	locals oh right it's a really local walking
A	it's very local yeah
B	mm
A	it's just like tower blocks so it's like a different tower block to mine
B	mm that's nice
A	mm
B	nice to know somebody really close you can always
A	mm
B	if you're ever in trouble or
A	yeah and actually when I had that hospital thing they were really good
B	oh yeah
A	they were the ones who came back yeah
B	mm
A	mm
B	oh that's nice
A	checked up on me
B	mm
A	yeah and I I just need to make an effort like I mean I guess like in mum and dad's case they tried with the neighbour and she doesn't want to be friendly but you
B	oh really?
A	you can try and then give up I guess can't you like they've done
B	yeah yeah you can always try
A	mm
B	mm which neighbour's that? the one
A	erm
B	or both?
A	the one who just got cancer actually who's
B	oh that one?
A	terminal
B	mm
A	yeah that's a shame
B	mm
A	mm
B	mm yeah
A	their neighbours were really really friendly apparently
B	so they
A	and tried a lot of times to like you know
B	invite them in and
A	friends invite them in but
B	they didn't want to
A	no
B	or maybe I don't know maybe grandma did
A	no but even now
B	oh yeah
A	cos
B	oh that's nice
A	mm
B	oh cos they quite liked er
A	mm okay
B	some of the children
A	oh that's nice
B	mm
A	yeah apparently they lived all their all their life in that house so they know all the history of
B	mm
A	highlands and that's kind of cool
B	yeah that is cool
A	so
B	oh yeah
A	that's kind of cool isn't it?
B	yeah I'd love to see some old photos or like you know the stories
A	yeah at least know the stories
B	what yeah cos it's so grand it must have had quite a
A	yeah all those stables and
B	something like nobility yeah
A	yeah and the servants like
B	yeah
A	I wonder where the servants live I don't really understand that
B	er
A	do you think they lived out? cos not all servants lived in did they?
B	no
A	did doesn't really seem like there's a servant's room you know like servants' quarters
B	no there was the room the bell comes the bells come through into the kitchen didn't they?
A	yeah so that suggests actually
B	they hang around
A	the servants didn't live in the building because in like Lanhydrock when we went there they had bells
B	oh yeah okay
A	so they'd know if they were ever needed
B	yeah
A	but yeah the only small bedrooms are the ones next to the bathrooms aren't they?
B	yeah but then they seem a bit close
A	they're
B	to the family
A	that's what I think I think they're too close
B	cos they're normally separated out
A	yeah and then it's obvious the stables have never been converted into rooms
B	mm mm and there's the coal shed but that wouldn't have been a room that's
A	no
B	I think that's pretty much a coal shed
A	yeah so I don't think they did live in they probably
B	no
A	lived in the village didn't they?
B	yeah and then came up for day shifts
A	yeah which is nice I guess they had a bit of privacy
B	yeah
A	no
B	oh
A	I keep meaning to watch it though
B	it is good I that's a shame I've probably just deleted all the
A	oh
B	copies I had I was running out of space I need a bigger hard drive
A	mm
B	but it's very good and you can get it on like Netflix or
A	yeah
B	one of those things
A	yeah yeah I should yeah I meant to download loads of stuff on my laptop before I left but I haven't whoops
B	mm
A	never mind
B	no it's really good I've watched all of them quite addictive
A	yeah I got a bit
B	what in
A	all of Humans did you watch that?
B	oh I just saw an advert on a bus was it Channel Four?
A	yeah
B	no I haven't seen it what's it about?
A	it's finished though
B	oh I could get it on 4OD anyway
A	oh okay there's only like six episodes
B	oh
A	so it's quite cool because a lot of sci-fi focuses on technology
B	mm
A	and it's a bit sort of techy isn't it? but this is quite cool cos it focuses on the humans
B	uhu
A	and their reaction to technology so it's basically about androids that they're robots but they
B	oh
A	so yeah and the
B	that's
A	so the father you know the typical family the mum's really busy she hasn't got really time to do everything the house is a mess
B	uhu
A	and they never get to spend time together
B	uhu
A	so the father without speaking to his wife like goes out
B	oh
A	and buys this robot
B	oh
A	and the kids are really excited the little kid's really excited and of course the robot comes home and does everything brilliantly
B	mm
A	like everything's clean she works out how they like their coffee and she remembers it
B	okay
A	and just everything's perfect and the wife reacts really badly of course cos she feels
B	yeah that's fair enough yeah
A	she doesn't have like a purpose
B	okay
A	in the house and she objects to it and then the teenage daughter's really anti robots just on principle so she hates it
B	right
A	and tries to hack it and is like
B	oh
A	basically abusing this robot except robots don't feel do they?
B	no
A	so what's the problem?
B	yeah
A	and then yeah the son ends up fancying her
B	oh okay
A	like the fifteen-year-old son cos she's really beautiful
B	mm
A	er so he gets really upset about how it's being treated
B	oh right okay
A	anyway yeah they get they take it back to the shop cos the family don't agree but the son gets so upset that he like chases after them and nearly dies in a car crash
B	oh
A	but somehow the robot saves them
B	that sounds quite good
A	yeah yeah
B	mm
A	so this it's nice it's looking at the human side and then it turns out it's not a normal robot it's one of like only five in the world where they're sentient and they can feel
B	oh it's like a
A	so they're like yeah
A	they've been abusing this robot so then
B	mm
A	how does that change the dynamic? that's like a person
B	quite different
A	yeah no the police are after them
B	oh
A	why are they after them? yeah it's quite cool
B	oh I I wanna watch that
A	and I like the fact that they focus on the human relationships
B	yeah
A	yeah cos it's different it's very few things have done that have they?
A	mm
B	at the beginning of the year it's called Ex Machina
A	oh okay
B	and it was quite similar it's erm
A	mm
B	this guy and and he gets and employed for his company to fly out
A	mm
B	and he just
A	yeah
B	to test it
A	okay
B	erm but it's smart it's a bit like that you know it's self-learning and so on
A	yeah
B	and it's really
A	mm
A	oh
B	and but it was all the machine was very clever cos the machine didn't fall in love back but imitated falling in love back
A	right
B	as a ploy to escape
A	oh
B	it's a very clever erm
A	that's clever
B	show how the machines you know are one or two steps ahead and
A	yeah
B	you know
A	yeah
A	but yeah it's good
B	oh it's a good one but it's a good film
A	mm
B	I liked it
A	that's cool and then I watched erm this programme
B	uhu
A	and then they have to they put their faith in these erm like
B	oh
A	through psychological profiling DNA analysis and all of this just science though pure science
B	is this the one where they get married?
A	yeah and they have to get married
B	oh yeah
A	without having seen each other
B	what did you think?
A	oh it was cool
B	I watched one episode
A	I think there were only three episodes ever
B	I couldn't believe they were getting married
A	oh they did
B	but I didn't but you can nullify marriage within like
A	yeah
B	two months can't you?
A	yeah exactly so that's what they did
B	yeah
A	so they had five weeks
B	oh okay
A	to and then if they didn't like each other yeah it would basically be I don't know if they had to divorce or it was annulled or what
B	just yeah cancelled yeah
A	mm
B	but so how did it go? cos I only saw the one episode they were starting
A	yeah
B	explaining it
A	disastrous they were
B	all of them?
A	in the end they only they had millions of people apply like
B	yeah
A	tens of thousands
B	couldn't believe so many
A	and they only matched three pairs which sounds rubbish doesn't it? like
B	really? out of that many?
A	yeah
B	oh
A	so that was
B	but they they had to be a really high
A	yeah
B	success rate
A	they went really really high to to make it work and then of those three couples one pulled out before the marriage
B	oh
A	cos the girl kind of got cold feet and her family didn't approve so she was
B	when she when she met him?
A	no
B	no
A	they weren't allowed to meet before the wedding
B	at all yeah
A	so then there were two couples left and they did go through with it but yeah one was disastrous and
B	yeah
A	there was the the husband he just stopped communicating with her it was just all an act
B	oh
A	like the wedding looked really good and it looked like they were getting on in the honeymoon
B	then he just
A	but then he just
B	went back to his true self
A	as soon as yeah and then it turned out
B	yeah
A	he was like on Tinder looking
A	for a new partner and her friend found out
B	oh
A	and told
B	yeah
A	and they never even said goodbye
B	oh okay
A	so that was really bad
B	yeah
A	and then the other couple got on fine and they were still together at the end after five weeks and they
B	oh really?
A	that's how they ended it
B	oh
A	I think that was the last one in the series
B	wow
A	but I guess they'll do another series it is quite cool because
B	yeah
A	you know in the Middle East like arranged marriage is
A	still the way it's done but it's not erm blind like that normally
B	okay
A	like they do normally meet like normally it's the parents and the brothers and the sisters are out kind of looking for a man like the girl will say I wanna get married
B	yeah
A	and then they'll all kind of look for someone suitable amongst their network
B	yeah
A	you know like someone's cousin or a friend of a friend
B	yeah
A	and then they kind of vet him like secretly from afar so they'll like ask questions
B	yeah
A	and then
B	if they're
A	if it's all okay then they invite him to the house and the girl's invited into the room and they
B	yeah
A	in more modern families they might be allowed to communicate by email or even phone
B	oh okay
A	but generally not in the Gulf
B	oh
A	and yeah but she's still allowed to say no she can
B	oh right
A	even when they meet she could say
B	it's
A	I don't like him so it's not a forced marriage
B	find another one yeah
A	yeah and then they'll just bring another one and that can go on for ages
B	yeah
A	but what's a bit nasty in the Gulf is it's linked with money
B	I was gonna say I think inevitably it's gonna be linked to status and money
A	so well there's dowry payments so
B	oh right
A	the guy has to actually pay and the
B	oh
A	the girls like for whatever reason or maybe it's the family I'm never quite sure go for the highest bidder
B	mm
A	so then that's nasty
B	that's not good
A	that becomes something else then
B	yeah
A	but I I don't like that idea it's not about them as a person
B	no I think if it's arranged like that but not to do with money
A	mm
B	you know I can kind of understand it working cos it happens all the time you introduce friends oh you'll get on great with this person
A	yeah I think you do it informally anyway
B	and it can you often pull people together
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah and it's not forced that she can say no but yeah the money thing I think I've talked to a lot of guys about that and then said oh you know I'm gonna get engaged and then it wouldn't work out and I'd say why and they would say it was usually the money they just
B	mm
A	asked for so much like they're really greedy
B	who and who gets the money the family?
A	the bride gets it
B	the bride?
A	but I wonder how much is actually given back to her parents
B	yeah
A	yeah it seems quite dodgy
B	cos if the bride gets it and then they get married don't they have fifty fifty anyway?
A	no it's all hers
B	oh they get sort of
A	yeah so that's kind of
B	oh
A	she would have been left penniless
B	oh yeah with nothing
A	and possibly with kids to bring up so that was her way of
B	it's a security
A	her way of surviving
B	yeah
A	like a divorce but nowadays that doesn't make sense because there
B	no
A	there is welfare and the state wouldn't let you know you starve to death
B	no
A	but yeah the money's hers it whatever happens
B	oh
A	it's not it doesn't in the past
B	and then to the highest bidder that's kind of weird
A	yeah it had a reason but now it just seems to be like money grabbing for money's sake
B	mm
A	and then like the divorce rate's really really high in the Gulf
B	is it?
A	and you're like yeah well that's part of the reason cos you went for the highest bidder not like
B	yeah
A	the one who's gonna make you happy
B	do you think that's do you think some people are just going for the money and then get the money and then get divorced cos they get to keep the money?
A	I wonder about that
B	some
A	yeah
B	and
A	yeah I wonder that
B	they didn't go for the person they liked yeah
A	and they don't get the chance to really get to know each other in most cases in the Gulf
B	yeah
A	like it is literally like they walk in a room oh he looks nice
B	yeah
A	he's got quite a lot of money
B	yeah
A	and it's just done on that not like I mean I guess in an ideal world they'd get to like court wouldn't they?
B	yeah
A	but yeah they weren't really allowed that
B	yeah
A	I don't know if it will change the divorce rate is really high like
B	I'm surprised I didn't think it would be so cos
A	yeah you wouldn't think so and they never publish their divorce figures
B	oh right
A	like but yeah it's crazy crazy high
B	mm
A	yeah it's weird I reckon a lot of them though the family pressures them to get married the boys and the girls so they get married to keep them happy knowing they can get divorced within like a year or so
B	yeah
A	and then they can kind of be with probably the person they've loved all their life you know they've got someone else in mind
B	in the back of their mind
A	until they've done for the marriage then then they're not gonna be allowed to marry them
B	yeah
A	I reckon that's what
B	and get the money
A	really happens
B	and the
A	yeah
B	that's a shame
A	yeah
B	men and women cheating or
A	I don't know about the women
B	yeah
A	I don't think so with the woman cos yeah that would be really
B	I can imagine that would be
A	shameful
B	very yeah
A	and that yeah
B	yeah very
A	but with the men oh it's really awful
B	oh okay
A	just
B	just can't
A	but they don't love their wife they marry her for kind of family reasons and
B	yeah
A	they don't really get on a lot of the time you know when
B	it's strange
A	yeah
B	living together
A	and then they might not
B	it's strange isn't it?
A	want to get divorced because of the sort of stigma
B	yeah
A	and maybe they've got loads of young kids
B	yeah
A	yeah it's not very nice
B	yeah a bit bizarre
A	mm and then I suppose if you just segregate the sexes then you can't really expect people to have like a normal marriage afterwards you know?
B	that's true
A	cos they don't know how to relate to each other
B	oh cos they're segregated you mean just with social situations and yeah
A	yeah so then the first time they have a like a non-family member it's their wife if they've never spent time with
B	yeah
A	so then it's gonna be awkward isn't it?
B	yes it is very strange yeah
A	for both sides
B	yeah yeah
A	especially in the UAE where it's even more segregated at least in Oman secondary school education was mix
B	oh is it?
A	so even though they didn't really talk to each like you must
B	at least see they you were around them
A	passively like have to like observe and see like okay they're not aliens and
B	yeah
A	you know there'd be something wouldn't there?
B	yeah
A	but yeah if you don't even have that
B	that is strange
A	yeah then you've yeah it must be really weird
B	yeah the money thing's weird I think
A	really?
B	yeah
A	are you serious?
B	I am so sure of it well I I don't think
A	mm
B	the the the dad
A	maybe it's a West African thing
B	yeah the dad wanted a farm but he ended up buying a herd of cows instead something like that so maybe it's more
A	oh
B	it's not like you have to give me this but it's probably maybe good practice to get a like a gift or something
A	oh that's really interesting isn't it?
B	yeah I'm
A	yeah yeah I think it is common in a lot of cultures still
B	mm
A	but yeah you kind of think that should end
B	yeah
A	like that's a
B	it really is
A	outdated practice
B	to be
A	and it's gonna be abused these days
B	yeah
A	very interesting
B	it's funny in life though how much like cos you think we don't live in like split society of money or whatever and everything's equal and all that
A	yeah
B	but really it's not like
A	no
B	I mean it the world is open to anything
A	mm
B	but like at work I look around and like people who I work with are my age and a hugely disproportionate number of people are from private schools
A	really?
B	oh yeah
A	me and yeah we were
B	er yeah
A	talking about that like how
B	and
A	some industries it's still so closed isn't it?
A	even in the UK
B	yeah or or I think they're just you know the money just prepares them for
A	mm
B	interviews and being extroverted and all that kind of thing which
A	or even just applying having the confidence to apply
B	yeah exactly
A	because can you remember being in a secondary school and someone saying to you you could be a doctor or a lawyer?
B	no the schools
A	no one ever said it to you
B	really oh
A	but I think it's maybe the expectations are so much lower
B	yeah
A	and that's ridiculous because you've got
B	yeah
A	students who are straight As
B	yeah that's
A	like you were
B	really bad in schools
A	and you never got taken aside by the careers advisor and
B	no and said oh you need to do this
A	said you need you need to be thinking about these careers
B	yeah
A	this is what you could be earning do you know what that means?
B	yeah no nothing I I think the school's
A	yeah it was ridiculous
B	it was terrible and I've said that in front of dad cos I think it was really bad
A	mm
B	erm like my work experience I worked er because I wanted to be a programmer I worked in a stationary shop just cos they sold computers I mean what work experience is that?
A	yeah
A	yeah and maybe they should force you to set your own up a bit more like
B	yeah yeah
A	they should say like this is the list we've got available or you can contact your own and probably
B	yeah like give you advice how to do that and stuff
A	yeah and that's quite useful like business skill
B	mm
A	in itself isn't it?
B	mm
A	how do you approach a business? like the writing a formal letter or a formal email
B	yeah
A	erm yeah that kind of stuff
B	but yeah the expectation of school is just like
A	but that's the main thing
B	you're gonna go and work at Tesco basically er
A	yeah the expectations were low
B	and it was rare if you said you wanted to go to uni most people wouldn't didn't say that or
A	yeah
B	didn't didn't plan to go
A	that is sad and like
B	oh really?
A	and like those are the people writing the news
B	yeah
A	but they're not
B	such a skewed view
B	yeah yeah
A	yeah they're not representative of anybody like just this very narrow even the tabloids it's the same it's not just the broadsheets
B	oh right
A	so like yeah that's about politics another one like
B	oh yeah sure
A	it's supposed to be broader now but I mean look at it like it's clearly not
B	well I mean look who
A	there's more women sure
B	yeah
A	but that is about it isn't it? they
B	yeah I mean look look at the powerful people in government you know George Osborne David Cameron
A	yeah all
B	Boris you know
A	Oxford
B	they're all from yeah
A	Eton
B	the same club
A	yeah
B	it's not good
A	yeah that's weird
B	yeah
A	but yeah they need to
B	it's sad the way that it is now
A	to push people more
B	yeah
A	in Cambridge when I went there that was ridiculous they were all from like local private schools and daddy this daddy that like
B	yeah
A	yeah pity but also that we're quite we're not very good at letting older people move sideways into new jobs even though we work for so much longer
B	mm
A	and they need to teaching is one of the few where they will be quite happy to see someone who's worked in say engineering move across into teaching
B	mm
A	and they think that adds something but most
B	yeah yeah
A	it's gonna be impossible for you
B	yeah
A	because of the costs involved
B	yeah
A	like
B	and thirty years of experience you've missed
A	yeah yeah but they need to have more like kind of like apprenticeships almost for
B	oh yeah for
A	doctors or engineers at a different point in
B	yeah yeah
A	people's career so yes
B	yeah
A	you you don't deserve to get a full wage obviously
B	no no but still
A	when you're training but obviously you've got to eat and live so you're
B	yeah
A	gonna need a minimum wage job and that
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	and and you'll learn quickly and you'll contribute
A	you're gonna learn
B	in other ways from your other career
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	I think so
B	yeah oh I think that like well I notice my job it's really like
A	mm
B	designing buildings
A	yeah that's worrying
B	once you're in
A	isn't it?
B	yeah well it's kind of nice for me cos you get these jobs and things oh we need someone with offshore experience I mean great but
A	yeah
B	it's strange
A	it is weird
B	I don't see the need
A	mm
B	you've still got the same core skills
A	yeah it's very narrow
B	mm
A	mm
B	I don't think forever no
A	no cos you've got your business ideas
A	oh
A	yeah you should talk to
B	yeah
A	moved out of a good career
B	mm
A	and made you know another good career
B	yeah
A	and did something he
B	something he was more passionate about
A	exactly he was more passionate about
B	yeah that's the issue it's like I
A	yeah
B	I want a job that I'm quite passionate about
A	mm I mean I guess ideally you want
B	yeah yeah
A	that's the ideal world where you don't really work that long on projects
B	yeah
A	and then you just take six months off
B	yeah that's right
A	go and live somewhere cheap but yeah that's not easy to arrange
B	no so I think sometimes I do really like engineering and I think like oh that could be quite good and
A	mm
B	enjoy it but then other times like I think my core engineering isn't as good as it could be but I think it's just cos I'm not that interested in like doing all the maths and stuff
A	yeah
B	you know er yeah I think I'll certainly keep going for another few years
A	mm
B	I think
A	mm yeah that's a good idea
A	yeah that's the way to do it isn't it?
B	uhu
A	start it off and see how it goes and then
B	yeah
A	yeah if you lose that money okay it's annoying but
B	it's not the end of the world
A	it's not the end of the world
B	no do you want some more lasagne?
A	er no I'm full actually but thank you are you gonna have more?
B	no
A	no it was nice really good
B	mm
A	mm
B	yeah
A	meal
B	it amazes me how
A	yeah
B	I had someone in the canteen a few weeks ago and he drove me nuts he was so annoying he was like
A	oh come on
B	and bought him and paid for the deposit he was like yeah after that I just did it all myself and that's what I want for my kids it's like most people don't have that
A	yeah that is ridiculous
B	I mean so annoying
A	yeah
B	I mean we we're lucky too cos we got through uni and most people don't
A	yeah
B	and yeah but some people have handouts for a long time like you know for property bought for them
A	yeah
B	that sort of thing yeah
A	that's true
B	I don't think that's needed but yeah it's quite a split world isn't it?
A	yeah it is and it's getting worse like the rich get richer and the
B	yeah
A	well I don't know if the poor get poorer but definitely the rich and the poor the when you look at graphs
B	splitting
A	and it's not just the UK is it? like the US is terrible
B	oh the US is awful oh well especially the whole top one percent thing
A	yeah I don't know what they can do about that
B	mm
A	I mean cos they'd say if you tax them more then they'll just go elsewhere
B	mm
A	which is always a risk
B	yeah
A	too bad
B	yeah
A	mm
B	it's erm I think it's only set to get worse because
A	I think so
B	if the
A	it feels like it whenever there's a credit crunch the rich never
B	seem to do well
A	really suffer in fact if anything they do better
B	cos you
A	more people renting
B	cos they take advantage of
A	or like you know yeah
B	or the situation
A	repossessed
B	get it on the cheap you can afford to invest and
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	that's right
B	yeah
A	it's a good time to invest
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah but I think well with technology there are two trains of thought one is that well we won't have to do any kind of boring manual work great that'll all be provided for free but the other train of thought which I think is more true is that those who can own the machines and the technology will do really well cos they don't need to employ people
A	mm
B	but then there
A	and that's
B	and that's happened you look at an
A	there's
B	an Amazon warehouse they're
A	yeah
B	you know
A	or Swindon with the car factories where
B	oh yeah
A	you used to employ like hundreds of people and now it employs like less than ten on a shift and it's
B	it's crazy
A	these massive robots and that's been going on for ages
B	yeah
A	but I remember going in there and them showing us
B	oh
A	and it is really impressive it's not men any more like standing in a line and doing one thing after another
B	it's just a machine
A	it's just a machine doing it
B	mm
A	and someone operating it
B	it's inevitable but yeah only the rich corporations or rich people can own these machines or
A	yeah but then what happens? like mass unemployment
B	yeah then there's the few people CEOs as you see get paid you know five hundred million a year
A	yeah
B	or whatever stupid sums and there's just this huge yeah and I think with technology anyway well the likes of all these web companies and stuff
A	yeah
B	they they basically have a market that reaches the whole world
A	mm
B	the CEO of you know Facebook
A	true
B	er say
A	yeah it's interesting you wonder what will happen
B	it's so global it just needs like one person and you can sell that for
A	mm
B	they were rich enough to invest or wise enough
A	I don't
B	I don't know what'll happen don't see it getting much better
A	no although at the moment labour is cheap enough in some parts of the world that the technology although it's there
B	yeah yeah
B	mm
A	it's cheaper to have the man go and turn the sprinkler on and off
B	yeah
A	three times a day
B	yeah
A	than to have an automatic system
B	bother doing it
A	with a timer
B	yeah
A	because that costs money and
B	mad isn't it?
A	that guy doesn't cost anything and he's replaceable
B	yeah well that's good for labour and if they're treated well
A	yeah I'm not sure they are
B	no I'm not sure they are
A	but yeah I guess that will take quite a long time before in some parts of the world
B	yeah
A	like people get replaced
B	mm I think our world like we've all we've all been used to living in a richer country for years
A	mm
B	you know the western world but er I think that's gonna be it's going downhill well it already is I think
A	mm
B	cos I think well there's you know I think the only reason some of these countries have done well is through not exploiting but through use of cheaper labour or
A	yeah well yeah
B	that's fine it's business
A	definitely well Britain's definitely gone down
B	yeah and it's got loads of
A	look at our manufacturing
B	yeah exactly
A	like our clothes are made in Bangladesh but
B	yeah
A	we all know like they're not exactly getting minimum wage are they?
B	no
A	and the safety conditions are terrible
B	but that advantage is disappearing
A	mm with mechanisation like
B	yeah yeah but also these countries so we you know we we used to be high tech and developing these things at high cost and making high profit that's been our model for
A	yeah
B	twenty years I suppose but now that that's gone as well
A	yeah
B	and
A	yeah that's true
B	and we've lost
A	but China's yeah I see what
B	lost our identity a little bit
A	but there's still a lot of developing countries China can't really be
B	yeah
A	be called a developing country
B	oh no no no that's right
A	in the past we used to say like developed developing
B	yeah
A	but it's too simple now
B	yeah
A	there's like things in between
B	scale
A	or what do they call them? like the Brics or the Rics? the
B	I think Brics
A	like recently industrialised
B	Brazil Russia and India
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah I mean
A	so it's too simplistic
B	Brics mm
A	yeah there's Ric and there's Bric isn't there? I think Bric is the
B	what's Ric? recently industrialised country?
A	yeah and then I think it includes Russia
B	ah
A	and then
B	and then there's Bric it's Brazil
A	Brazil Brazil yeah
B	yeah
A	mm
B	mm
A	then we're gonna have mass famine
B	yeah
A	because the world can only support X many people
B	yeah the
A	that's called the Malthus there was this guy called Malthusian principle says that
B	okay
A	and then there's another school of thought and that's pretty old that's like hundreds of years old that guy's
B	right
A	er hundreds of years ago and then there's this other woman interestingly who came along you know eighteen hundreds and said that's wrong
B	oh
A	Boserup this is and she said technology necessity is the mother of all invention
B	mm
A	and technology will surpass every time the the like the world gets to its carrying capacity for food versus
B	oh it resolves it
A	population it will resolve itself because it's a necessity and that will breed innovation and to date
B	mm
A	she's probably been right like India was said to have this mass famine according to the Malthusian model
B	okay
A	and it never ever happened
B	they managed to
A	because the green revolution came along and then they had all these like dwarf varieties of wheat which
B	oh
A	grew much quicker and they had
B	oh okay
A	fertiliser and they had this and it's not without problems cos they've also had pollution
B	yeah and and we innovating now with GM and everything
A	yeah exactly and now
B	I mean you can do you can grow meat
A	yeah so we've got the this was the green revolution and now they're calling this one the G revolution
B	ah okay
A	but the inevitably there'll be something else won't there?
B	yeah
A	and all of these have problems but we've never reached a point of global starvation and I don't think we ever will because look at like the capacity you have even in cities for urban farming which people are experimenting with like
B	ah
A	using rooftops to grow food or warehouses there's such a lot of empty space
B	yeah the city could almost be self-sustaining
A	it could like
B	almost
A	if you look at the rafters
B	there's a lot of space
A	you know in houses like everyone's got that space for nothing
B	yeah
A	and that could grow mushrooms say
B	oh right yeah
A	or water where you know the Japanese have much more intensively done aquaculture
B	oh
A	and grown mussels and oysters
B	oh
A	on just little rafts
B	okay
A	floating on the sea but the turnover is phenomenal like so if you just wanted to produce protein
B	you could could you?
A	you could in a very small body of seawater
B	oh
A	so yeah
B	yeah
A	I kind of feel like we'll never reach carrying capacity and it's nonsense to only talk about farmland disappearing
B	space yeah
A	because even in the desert now with like where there's no soil it's all like hydroponics right?
B	right
A	and it's cheap it is economical like there a bunch of herbs is ten P here you'll pay at least one pound fifty for the same bunch
B	oh right
A	and that's grown in soil so
B	oh that's interesting
A	there there is a kind of
B	yeah
A	you know it's not an economic argument to say that it can't be done
B	no you put yourself I think by using technology like all hydroponics and stuff
A	mm
B	the risk is that you you put yourself in quite a precarious
A	yeah
B	so if one's er something going wrong everything falls down
A	mm
B	whereas if we're just growing on farmland it's not really interconnected and so on
A	but it's interconnected in other ways like bad weather
B	yeah
A	whereas you could say in a greenhouse
B	yeah
A	that can be more controlled so you
B	yeah
A	you don't really have a a bad weather year
B	no
A	where the apples fail but
B	yeah
A	but yeah I guess technology could fail and the greenhouse I dunno
B	yeah
A	breaks or whatever and like yeah and obviously
B	yeah
A	in the desert that would be disastrous if your cooling system didn't work
B	yeah
A	then it can't be done
B	yeah
A	but it is amazing
B	see you're more
A	the
B	like mm
A	the greenhouses now we've got in the UK like East Anglia they grow them like vertically tomatoes
B	oh
A	and it's just phenomenal like the turnover
B	and how quick they can do it
A	yeah
B	oh wow
A	yeah like just masses and masses and like
B	that's cool that
A	machines for harvesting as well
B	very well yeah industrial farming's been industrial for ages
A	yeah it has in a way it was probably the first thing that got industrialised wasn't it?
B	yeah
A	but we're still dealing with the fallout from that
B	in what what way?
A	like farm farmers not making money
B	oh
A	and like
B	mm
A	yeah it got so cheap to mass produce that
B	yeah I see what you mean
A	small farmers got pushed out
B	yeah
A	and it's now just sort of big agro business isn't it?
B	yeah yeah huge interesting there's erm I don't know where I saw this it was on TV some documentary er about the human race the human brain
A	mm
B	and it periods in history where it's known there's been a huge issue like the ice age or you know a huge a threat to the human race they found that the human brain erm or the skull has increased in size
A	oh that's interesting
B	there's there's a direct correlation
A	mm
B	so it's an increase er well they think an increase in brain power essentially so when you need to survive when there's a
A	yeah
B	real threat your brain kind of accommodates it and it gets bigger and they get more intelligent
A	that makes sense that's very Boserup kind of
B	oh is it?
A	extended
B	yeah yeah like yeah
A	you know idea about necessity and invention but also a necessity in evolution yeah I remember reading
B	it's quite interesting
A	you know traditionally we thought of evolution happening very slowly which it probably does
B	but it might be more spurts
A	but there seems to be yeah it seems to be that the main like mutations have actually occurred when a serious threat's occurred
B	oh really? so there's a theme there?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	which makes sense doesn't it?
B	I don't know does it? I don't know how does that fit into random mutations though?
A	cos there are always random mutations but
B	yeah
A	but perhaps there's no advantage to having
B	oh that's true
A	a random mutation so there's no reason for it to be selected naturally selected
B	that's true but when there's a threat
A	but if say there was a threat
B	ah
A	and you randomly mutated and that one's smarter
B	yes
A	then you're more likely to get through that and there'll be a sort of bottleneck where
B	that's true
A	anyone who's a bit thicker and couldn't work out how to do it
B	doesn't get through
A	dies off
B	yeah
A	yeah that kind of makes sense to me
B	that makes sense and if let's say you know seventy percent of the population died during those threats
A	yeah
B	that makes a lot of sense cos the the thirty percent with that mutation will go through and then suddenly that's a whole
A	yeah
B	that's like succeeded right?
A	yeah no it makes sense to me
B	it does make sense yeah
A	mm a kind of bottleneck like an evolutionary bottleneck
B	yeah
A	mm
B	I did my dissertation on genetic algorithms
A	did you?
B	yeah
A	oh oh that's cool
B	really interesting it was
A	oh
B	it was on so genetic algorithm is a
A	mm
B	you let the computer solve it through natural selection
A	oh okay
B	of the population of random initial solutions
A	yeah
B	erm that's er er so that's cool so you kind of have to
A	oh
B	they're normally multi-objective or multi erm yeah multi-objective problems
A	mm
B	where like there's no just simple formula
A	yeah
B	so I thought what's a good one? and I thought well tidal turbines
A	yeah
B	but a tidal of
A	mm
B	and there are so many factors in what in what essentially is a profitable one it would be the speed of the water the interaction on one to another
A	yeah
B	local effects even the length of cabling that you need so
A	yeah
B	complex thing and and they all interact with each other so it was a really good one so
A	mm
B	so so the software generation number one just created a whole load of random coordinates and just stuck a load of random turbines in the water
A	oh
B	then it would measure its fitness essentially through the mass that is what you can code is you know like cost of keeping it and all that kind of stuff
A	yeah
B	and and it sorry its the first population would have a population of like say a hundred
A	yeah
B	and they would they would erm mutate
A	mm
B	and reproduce
A	okay
B	so the next one you'd pick it would
A	oh okay
B	and then and then erm they'd breed together and then a one random mutation and then that
A	oh that's clever
B	and it's cool cos you could watch it on the screen and the turbines would slowly move and they would slowly line up cos that was an optimum reduction in cabling then
A	mm
B	or they'd space themselves apart so there's no interaction
A	wow
B	cool
A	that is cool
B	really neat yeah
A	wow what's going on?
B	dunno sounds like a fire truck
A	yeah it does actually
A	mm
B	well like a third or a fifth or
A	yeah it's
B	something
A	some crazy statistic that
B	yeah
A	it doesn't really make sense to talk about a food crisis erm in terms of production
B	no
A	there are other problems like distribution sure
B	yeah
A	like but that's a localised problem
B	yeah
A	and maybe we've just got people erm in the wrong places really
B	mm
A	you know if the climate's changing
B	well maybe
A	and there's drought there then that area is no longer sort of able to support a human population naturally
B	yeah yeah
A	so we shouldn't have huge megacities like
B	yeah like
A	Perth or something
B	right
A	you know like that's gonna be
B	yeah
A	people need to move and it's only developed
B	yeah
A	countries that can afford
B	yeah
A	to keep people there
B	if you've got the money
A	whereas like say Sudan or something
B	they'd never live there
A	they need to move those people need to go somewhere
A	but the problem is where do they go?
B	yeah
A	but it will happen naturally like migration
B	yeah and it does happen
A	and it is happening
B	yeah
A	the migrant crisis
B	mm
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	and that will be interesting to see how we cope because refugee has a very narrow definition in law like what makes a refugee? but we're now getting the point where we've got environmental refugees like
B	what's that?
A	er where
B	oh like fleeing from yeah
A	for example your
B	the conditions
A	yeah like low lying islands in the Pacific are actually being flooded
B	oh yeah
A	because of local climate change but they don't actually
B	no
A	of a refugee
B	but I suppose they are though
A	who have to be yes of course they are
B	they need
A	but the law needs to change to support that because then they could claim asylum
B	yeah
A	I mean their homeland
B	because it's unsuitable to live
A	has actually been destroyed
B	yeah
A	but that's an extreme example where you can show their home doesn't exist
B	yeah
A	like obviously they have to go
A	somewhere else but what about where it becomes so dry or so hot
B	yeah
A	like at what point do you say this land is no
B	yeah
A	and people have to leave?
B	it's quite a hard definition quite multi
A	yeah exactly because it depends on a lot of factors doesn't it? like
B	yeah
A	are you able to import food? so then it's about economy
B	yeah
A	like it yeah
B	yeah cos otherwise you could claim asylum from Perth
A	right
B	and it's couldn't you right?
A	yeah
B	although er although actually the government would provide everything
A	it would have to
B	if you didn't have
A	determine it in terms of food security I suppose like
B	yeah
A	but then food security could be short term problem
B	yeah
A	right like civil war but
B	yeah
A	but yeah I guess that's already covered under war the
B	mm
A	droughts aren't usually permanent they're cyclical so then at what point do you say like
B	how long do you live through it or
A	how long do they have to?
B	should you have to
A	yeah
B	or yeah
A	mm
B	oh complex
A	it is yeah
B	yeah
A	it's still so small scale like Exeter's got this really cool project where they collect coffee grounds
B	oh yeah?
A	this company or charity I'm not sure which from like
B	yes
A	from like coffee shops for free you know a lot of it and
B	and get rid of the waste
A	will give it for free and then they put into kind of like er sort of a sandbag kind of thing but a bit bigger
B	mm
A	and they've cut holes in the side and
B	oh
A	they
B	do you plant them?
A	they plant the spores of oyster mushrooms in them and they just hang them on hooks in this kind of like warehouse
B	mm
A	and then they grow and they sell those back
B	oh cool
A	to supermarkets locally so that's really nice it's cyclical
B	yeah
A	because their input material is just waste
B	yeah
A	and their output is something they can sell
B	that's good so
A	and it doesn't taste
B	it pays for itself
A	yeah and as it happens they're using an empty warehouse but theoretically I guess you could use any dark place
B	yeah
A	like a ceiling in a house or
B	oh yeah? yeah
A	you know in a factory where there's like rafters and
B	yeah
A	you just need like to be able to walk around and be able to harvest them but yeah I guess you can't live off mushrooms but
B	no but you'd have many many things
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	I mean that's particularly good cos it doesn't need light I guess you don't have to make any conversions
B	yeah
A	to you know like most things
B	oh yeah
A	would need light
B	that's true
A	so it's not really practical to retrofit you know glass ceilings or whatever
B	no
A	but lots of places have flat roofs don't they? like industrial units that potentially could be
B	cool
A	yeah a garden
B	mm it's such a shame we don't use our roof spaces
A	yeah
B	isn't it?
A	that's a waste isn't it?
B	it's a huge space
A	it's a really dead space
B	yeah
A	and then you see really cool houses like in Scandinavia where they grass over the roof
B	oh I like that
A	as insulation
B	yeah
A	so it's a very thick layer of insulation
B	that's true
A	yeah that's cool I really like that idea
B	yeah
A	mm
B	in Korea they did use their roofs quite well there there would be gardens and stuff
A	oh that's good
B	yeah
A	yeah and in the Middle East they are you know
B	have
A	built strong enough to not
B	oh
A	but they're strong enough that they put water tanks and stuff
B	oh yeah
A	but they're strong you can walk on they're designed to be walked on
B	oh that's good
A	whereas ours usually aren't are they?
B	no
A	but
B	yeah
A	yeah I guess we just need to but that's a huge amount of space isn't it?
B	yeah
A	and then there's this cool project in London I saw where they have a supermarket and they grow there's a community garden on the roof
B	oh right
A	and then they sell the produce downstairs in the supermarket
B	that's cool
A	so that's nice like really like zero
B	local
A	food miles
B	yeah
A	yeah yeah
B	mm
A	mm
B	and you'll so much waste
A	yeah
B	so why it's a shame we can't reuse or recondition stuff a bit more
A	yeah
B	or put new fronts on rather than whole thing and all of that
A	it's true
B	oh it is
A	so that they get more money
B	well Ikea
A	if things were modular then
B	yeah
A	it
B	Ikea deliberately makes well they they basically converted the furniture market and made it something cos previously people who buy a nice wooden table and it would last
A	mm
B	like twenty years Ikea made it cheap and such that it's fashionable so therefore it's in fashion and then out of fashion like
A	yeah
B	clothes right?
A	that is good yeah
B	and then you have to even though they're not broken you're buying new ones every three years cos they're out of fashion
A	yeah
B	they've done the same thing with their furniture
A	yeah
A	that's true yeah
B	you you look at old Ikea stuff from ten years ago it looks awful
A	yeah?
B	doesn't stand up yeah
A	oh
B	the style
A	doesn't stand up yeah
B	doesn't stand up
A	yeah I think it's really nice the pine I like it
B	yeah I I just think it lasts
A	is it pine or beech?
B	I think it's pine yeah
A	mm yeah it's nice yeah
B	erm
A	it looks solid so these were
B	yeah
A	from a charity shop?
B	these this was from Gumtree
A	oh okay yeah it's really nice
B	these are from a charity shop
A	yeah
B	the bed is from a charity shop
A	oh okay
B	you know I like charity shops
A	and do you have to arrange delivery?
A	from the charity shop?
B	but no they erm the charity shops offer delivery
A	do they? cos there's one by
B	mm
B	ah
A	how much was this?
B	er how much did I buy it for?
A	mm
B	this and the four chairs was sixty-five
A	okay
B	but I'll sell
A	yeah
B	the four chairs for thirty and this this was thirty-five
A	yeah mm
B	and these were seven fifty each I think
A	okay but they'll arrange delivery if you want what for free? or
B	no so I got
A	no
B	the bed frame and the that sideboard delivered from the same shop
A	mm
B	and the I think that was
A	ah that's good
B	but fifteen's not bad I think
A	I think fifteen's okay
B	cos they're carrying it over here they're carrying it up the stairs and
A	yeah
B	that's fair enough
A	no I might do that there is quite a good one I noticed by the bus station yeah
B	and there's a really good one in
A	ah okay
B	and and they pick up people's unwanted furniture for free
A	mm
B	and then yeah they've got a huge warehouse
A	oh nice
B	cos if you look in the charity shops there's often not much you've just got
A	mm
B	two or three items and you can't really just go there and get five things on one delivery
A	yeah
B	but this one a huge warehouse and you could pick up just you've got a choice of fifteen sofas and
A	oh yeah that's good
B	ten dining tables
A	mm
B	yeah you could get a lot
A	mm yeah pine's a nice choice though
B	yeah it lasts
A	I like wood
B	it's fairly timeless
A	yeah
B	isn't it?
A	it's very timeless yeah
B	yeah
A	it can work with other colours
B	yeah
A	and it's a good idea to have a theme I think in the house like
B	do
A	don't you think? if it's a
B	yeah
A	smaller space then it's easier to have
B	it's a bit
A	one theme like
B	yeah
A	just pine because if you start going dark wood
B	like
A	and then you move into pine
B	that's true
A	then it's not a big enough space to really carry it off
B	that's true and sometimes you want to actually move furniture between rooms occasionally
A	yeah that's true
B	or if you ever move
A	yeah I might try and do that keep it light
B	yeah
A	and pine is a nice light wood isn't it?
B	yeah I think it always looks nice
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	or I can
B	what
A	just buy from Ikea in Bristol and bring it down
B	you could the Ikea's nice in a way cos you can put it all the car and
A	yeah it's flat pack
B	it's just quite simple isn't it? and it looks nice but I find I bought in that other flat an Ikea table and
A	mm have you got Ikea here in
B	yeah
A	oh that's good
B	but it er it erm it marks really the cheaper stuff marks really easily
A	oh okay so you know
B	so even now a year on it doesn't look great
A	yeah
B	erm yeah
A	mm
B	I like I like the charity shops cos you can get good stuff
A	yeah and this is actually
B	like I
A	treated isn't it? cos I think yeah
B	yeah
A	the cheap Ikea stuff I've bought before it hasn't been treated
B	oh okay
A	the pine so it stains like if you put a little glass and it's got water on it
B	it'll mark
A	wood will stain
B	yeah
A	whereas this won't stain
B	no it's varnished and everything
A	yeah yeah that's it they haven't varnished it I guess you could do it yourself but
B	yeah you could
A	bit of a hassle
B	cos I think I've kitted I'll have kitted this whole place out for doing it second-hand er
A	yeah
B	gets everything
A	that's good
B	which if you if you bought a sofa new it would cost you six hundred pounds
A	I know
B	just a sofa
A	sofas are ridiculous
B	but second-hand they're good like the one I nearly bought somebody got it before me and it was a hundred and ninety for a really nice really good condition
A	mm
B	leather three seater and an armchair I thought that's pretty good
A	yeah that is really good
B	although yeah I'd have had to pay for forty pound delivery but
A	mm
B	cos it wasn't from a charity shop so I have to arrange my own
A	yeah yeah that's pain
B	yeah
A	mm
B	yeah he did that worktop must have been treated once but it's a bit worn but because it's real wood I can just
A	yeah
B	sand it down
A	you can sand it down
B	and retreat it
A	yeah it's alright
B	yeah so it'll be fine when it's redone
A	yeah I think it looks quite nice did that chopping block come with that or
B	yeah cos I think it's made from the worktop
A	yeah it looks like it's made from it yeah
B	yeah
A	I think so looking at the sandwich
B	this big table you see that big piece of wood behind the chairs?
A	yeah
B	that was this kitchen table
A	oh really?
B	and they've shaped it
A	oh
B	to fit the wall
A	oh wow
B	but it was just too big cos it came out to here
A	yeah
B	all the way like this
A	and you don't need it that big
B	no and you
A	it's a bit silly
B	and you couldn't sit the other side so it ended up it was just three chairs facing the wall
A	yeah
B	which was really weird
A	no this is better what you've done
B	yeah bit nicer
A	so do you know who lived here before? did you meet them or was it?
B	I didn't meet them
A	no
B	no just the agent there were two
A	oh right
B	there were a couple that seemed to be from Ireland they had different surnames but they both owned it so I guess they were partners
A	oh okay oh
B	mm
A	mm
B	strange when you don't meet them
A	yeah that is weird
B	and the flat in Edinburgh was owned by a property company when I bought it
A	oh okay
B	yeah so it just obviously had tenants for years
A	mm
B	yeah maybe they moved back to Ireland
A	mm no the other one
B	oh maybe
A	maybe
B	and retiring or
A	mm
B	yeah
A	yeah and they needed modernising
B	it seemed they were from what I saw they were selling quite a number of properties actually
A	ah okay yeah
B	so
A	yeah selling up then
B	yeah
A	pension
B	yeah exactly
A	mm
B	yeah
A	yeah it's cool
B	fancy doing tomorrow? is there anything you had on your list for
A	oh
A	no I wanted to do
B	no
A	something with
B	that's good
A	so that's good no tomorrow didn't you say about the walk?
A	tomorrow's Friday isn't it?
B	yeah that but that erm
A	that's the last day really
B	but we're
A	that's in the afternoon
B	yeah we're gonna get there for about half six so we won't have to leave till
A	no but that's the meal you said at half six
B	yes
A	but the walk's
B	but
A	before that
B	yeah but it's not that long so we won't have to leave for the walk
A	ah
B	until around three
A	ah okay
B	sort of thing
A	no but you said it was seven miles
B	yeah
A	so that's over two hours two and a half hours
B	yeah
A	so half six
B	start the walk at
A	so we need to be there for half six?
B	well no seven the table's booked for seven
A	seven
B	so let's aim to get there for half six
A	okay so let's say half six and then half
B	let's say two and half hours
A	let's say yeah four
B	four
A	is more
B	but we'll we'll have to get to the car and drive to start the walk
A	yeah
B	so so sort of er what did you just say? four?
A	four is the
B	so it'll be half
A	latest you could start
B	half three so let's say
A	oh it's not that far
B	sort of three or half three
A	okay
B	three or half three
A	three or half three
B	it's not that
A	okay so we have got all day
B	so we've got
A	okay
B	a good bit of the day really
A	so we could do another
B	yeah we could yeah
A	maybe we should try and do a free one
B	be quite fun yeah I'm up for that
A	yeah
A	it's a bit hit and miss but it's kind of nice to do it
B	yeah
A	but where do you check about the free stuff?
B	you can just look them up online
A	okay
B	on the app and we so we can just pick one in the morning see what you feel like
A	yeah let's do that
B	mm
A	that's kind of fun
B	and there'll be a lunchtime one
A	we did a good one today so if it's rubbish we'll be like
B	doesn't matter
A	well okay it doesn't matter we didn't spend any money
B	yeah
A	so we don't really care
B	oh actually a good thing to do is actually look at the reviews for the free ones for this year
A	oh okay
B	cos you know people often write I found a good one last year doing that
A	nice
B	yeah
A	yeah let's do that cos we've got plenty of time haven't we?
B	yeah
A	yeah and that's all really just wanted to do some
B	okay that's good
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah I liked that today I really enjoyed that
B	good
A	mm did you like it?
B	yeah I liked it it was good
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	there was more audience participation than I expected
B	yeah me too
A	I wasn't really expecting that cos it was sketches
B	yeah
A	I mean I thought
B	I liked the sketches
A	yeah they're funny
B	I really did
A	I really like the one with the erm
B	like the
A	just a woman thing and they were like taking the piss out of you know
B	oh
A	the charity people
B	oh yeah the Indian one
A	yeah
B	yeah that was a good one
A	that was really good
B	it's so true yeah that's the and like
A	oh you mean the the with the sort of gap year ones?
B	yeah yeah
A	where they're yeah my teacher
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah that's true
B	no it's good
A	but I liked the one afterwards where were like doing like little pitches for like various talks
B	oh
A	and they were like
B	yeah
A	you know a politician and the
B	yeah
A	the erm yeah the sort of posh charity worker
A	yeah
B	and the NGO one
A	yeah the NGO one
B	yeah that was good
A	exactly
B	doing up town houses
A	yeah exactly
B	that was good
A	and they'd like you know and er you know the black boys you know
A	they
B	yeah terrible
A	like you know racial profiling
A	and then giving them something they really didn't need at the end like olive green doors
A	and brass door knockers and driven up property prices like
A	no concept of what they actually wanted
A	like a kind of white like they call it the white saviour complex don't they? like the
B	yeah
A	the white person riding in
B	wanting to
A	and like
B	yeah right
A	claiming to have saved the day and the
B	just doing an hour's work and
A	yeah possibly haven't saved anyone from anything and
B	no
A	maybe even made it worse
B	yeah
A	yeah and driven up their self-confidence immeasurable
A	yeah I could really see that being said as well
B	yeah I I thought the the the one at the end with the
A	oh the lads one
B	that was funny
A	that was quite funny
B	cos this like lads are so funny though
A	yeah that I did actually
A	kind of imagine as well
B	like a different language
A	yeah it was like football
B	yeah
A	yeah they were good cos they kind of and then they did the accents really well I thought like
B	yeah
A	the Australian accent was good
B	really good I don't know if she was Scottish that one but she did a good Scottish accent and then did a good English one
A	yeah no I thought it was good
B	yeah
A	yeah they were good actors
B	yeah
B	yeah we'll do a free one then
A	yeah
B	we could see what to do for lunch we could have erm I've got pizza here if we want it
A	oh okay cool
B	or we can do something else
A	I guess if we're going for dinner we don't really need to go out for
B	no
A	lunch as well
B	that's it and I can er or alternatively I can make the bread got the bread maker there
A	oh yeah mm
B	for lunch
A	mm did you buy that?
A	oh that's nice
B	mm nice to use it we probably make one loaf a week at the weekend
A	yeah
B	it's nice for er like a Saturday lunch we just
A	what?
A	that's a lot
B	just one loaf
A	oh okay
B	you know or a little bit gets left yeah
A	mm
B	it's nice I like bread and cheese and soup
A	yeah
B	this year for my birthday
A	oh yeah I've seen them
B	yeah
A	they're cool
B	really cool
A	yeah
B	and I've been talking about it since oh it's such a nice day it would be nice to go along the canal or something
A	yeah
B	but they're quite sturdy you can actually take it down rapids if you want
A	oh really? well cool
B	yeah so you know it's not gonna puncture
A	yeah it was on that Ben Fogle's programme last weekend
B	oh did he have one?
A	this guy on a yacht had an inflatable kayak and there were sharks in the water it looked really scary but
A	yeah didn't seem like the best choice of kayak but anyway
B	no
A	it looked cool I was like yeah that's really practical
B	it's and really cos it fits it's just a box it fits under your bed
A	yeah
B	and we will just we'll we'll go when we're in
A	yeah that's a really nice idea cos I I've
B	just
A	always like the idea of having a kayak but
B	where do you put it?
A	you know like yeah exactly where do you put it? and then
B	mm how do you get it yeah? you
A	transporting it is pain
B	cos you don't have the
A	it's not practical
B	no but this yeah you just so you'd arrive to the waterside walk over to the edge of the canal you know through
A	yeah
B	and then you just pump it and off you go
A	yeah that's really cool
B	really nice
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	nice idea
B	I don't think I'd take it onto the sea just yet it's a bit
A	no
B	cos it's a two person one so it's quite long
A	okay
B	yeah but good for canals and lakes and erm
A	yeah no it's really cool
B	yeah
A	mm
B	I like the idea of spending the day on the canal just chilling and reading with a bottle of cider
A	yeah oh yeah
A	I like kayaking actually
B	mm
A	I do that in
B	oh yeah
A	we just hire them
A	it's
B	yeah
A	but it there's no waves
B	is it calm?
A	it's like
B	oh that's nice
A	completely protected and there's loads of birds
B	oh that's really nice
A	flamingos you can see flamingos quite a lot when
B	cool
A	the tide goes out then you see them on the flats feeding on the mudflats
B	oh I could do that
A	yeah
A	well not even mudflats they're like sand flats
B	yeah
A	yeah yeah it's cool
B	it sounds nice
A	we took mum I took mum
B	I remember mum said she liked it
A	yeah
B	she had a busy trip you'd planned it quite well I think
A	yeah we did quite a lot
B	active
A	cos I thought yeah not too much I think though there was
B	but something each day kind of
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah and she liked the tennis
B	oh yeah Andy Murray
A	yeah
B	mm
A	and Nadal
B	yeah
B	oh
A	someone pulled out Djokovic
B	oh
A	pulled out
B	right
A	cos he had like a strained muscle or something so the whole thing was cancelled
B	did they give everybody a refund?
A	no
B	oh
A	they were really bad they gave them tickets for next year that's like pointless
B	well
A	yeah
B	are just visiting
A	exactly that's so bad
B	yeah that's terrible
A	yeah that is ridiculous
B	yeah the street in the where we were it seemed to be on fire half the time I was
A	there must be a fire truck right at the end
B	mm
A	oh right that's silly
A	yeah
B	have you seen the erm one the erm trending the dentist the American dentist who
A	no
B	killed the lion?
A	oh yes
A	yeah Cecil the lion
B	yeah Cecil that's it
A	he had a name
B	yeah
A	yeah it's a bit unfortunate he's being singled out
B	well so many people
A	cos if it goes on all the time and the king of Spain
B	oh really?
A	and it wasn't about shooting the elephant it was about the extravagance of going on a hunting trip while
B	yeah
A	Spain was in like this major financial crisis
B	oh yeah
A	austerity measures
B	that's pretty bad
A	so he stepped down because of that and nothing to do with the lion but no one made or the elephant or whatever it was but no one made a fuss
B	yeah
A	about the elephant
B	no it's one unlucky
A	no I don't
B	quite unlucky to be to be to be penalised so much
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah I think so I mean it is really immoral like
B	yeah
A	you know rich people going off and trophy hunting
B	it's so bizarre because I don't get it cos they don't even keep the animal or stuff they just get a photo and that's it done
A	yeah
B	it's weird
A	no it's it's unpleasant but
B	I mean it's not even proper hunting though they
A	no
B	cos half the animals are bred in
A	yeah but don't you think that's the same with hunting here? like grouse hunting where they're
B	no that's true yeah
A	they're raised and pheasants and all those birds they're like
B	yeah
A	raised aren't they? and then released and shot and
B	yeah
A	oh it's hunting like it's not really hunting is it?
B	cos you've just suddenly let a few go and
A	yeah and like they have grouse beaters don't they like driving the grouse
B	oh right towards
A	out like walking in a line so that it flushes them out and then they shoot them and you're like
B	yeah
A	well I don't think that's really proper hunting
B	not really no that's true
A	no
A	yeah yeah
B	like some
A	it's unpleasant because they're endangered as well so
B	yeah
A	you know what's he doing? like
B	yeah
A	but yeah I mean obviously he's had death threats and stuff so
B	yeah well he's had to shut down his whole livelihood the dental practice hasn't he?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	but yeah he was stupid for doing it just a pity he's being hounded
B	yeah
A	mm
B	it'll die down but
A	but there is an argument
B	so
A	like a conservationist from that park came on TV and said look it's unpleasant but the fact is they bring in a lot of money
B	mm
A	when they do it legally trophy hunting to
B	which allows them to
A	and
B	yeah he said he thought it was
A	yeah but it does bring in money big money and where where do people think that money's coming from?
B	yeah and like is that money what's that money spent on? maybe not necessarily animal welfare but it's coming into the country
A	well yeah that's true I suppose that's another thing
B	yeah
A	mm
B	I watched a Louis cos you told me about it a Louis Theroux
A	oh yeah did you watch that?
B	I watched one a few months ago on this exact topic
A	oh really? that's funny
B	yeah before before this
B	and then it turned out that they were feeding they there was this feeding spots they just knew exactly where it's gonna be so
B	Jamie Oliver? the cook?
B	oh I don't know
A	Oliver something erm he's British but he does his talk show like a news talk show in like Manhattan or something
B	oh
A	er I'll send you a link and yeah it's really funny he's like really satirical and
B	oh
A	and like just takes like a news story and runs with it like the death penalty but he's like
B	yeah
A	taking the piss out of Americans as he does it
B	okay
A	and he like just like destroys their argument but it's funny
B	yeah
A	but he's making a serious point but
B	just sarcastically
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	just like tears their
B	oh that's like
A	just there's no you can't argue with him at the end
A	but it's just a talk show it's not like a interviews or anything
B	okay
A	but he takes good issues
B	it's good
A	like brave kind of stuff like to talk about
B	yeah
A	not just easy one like the lion you know is kind of
B	that is an easy one
A	an easy one in a way isn't it?
B	everybody's on your side
A	everybody agrees it's not a great idea
B	or if you don't agree you're in the wrong
A	to hunt
A	endangered animals there isn't really much to discuss here
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	but yeah other stuff's not so simple
A	no
B	no
A	mm
B	you don't like? or
A	just don't find a lot of stuff I like I guess
B	yeah
A	maybe I just need to look around more
B	I like erm I actually I like I really like Have I Got News for You? it's one of my favourite shows
A	mm
B	I like BBC comedy I find it quite good
A	yeah it is
B	well I maybe that's the thing is British humour is quite different to other humour
A	yeah
B	like American humour
A	that's true
B	don't like those shows any more
A	mm
B	do you want another beer?
A	no I think I'm good actually
B	okay
A	mm do you want anything?
B	no
A	cup of tea?
B	oh actually tea sounds nice yeah
A	yeah I might have a herbal tea I think I've got some teabags
B	already?
A	yeah
B	you've brought some?
A	well I had some loose and I thought I don't know what those are so I'll just bring them
B	yeah I might have a normal tea I think
A	ah caffeine doesn't keep you awake?
B	no not tea
A	mm
A	that's good yeah I'll do the washing up too
B	oh thank you put this away
A	you're welcome
A	yeah you sound like you're sort of coughing away
B	mm I had it bad at
A	oh okay
B	really achy and then it died a bit and it's come back a bit today
A	do you want that in the fridge?
B	yeah I might put it into some erm Tupperware and freeze some of it
A	ah idea
B	got some somewhere
A	no I don't
B	no?
A	but thank you
B	okay
A	no cos I'm doing that cat-sitting staying thing
B	the what sorry?
A	cat-sitting the first week I'm back
B	oh
A	so they'll have a
B	great
A	washing machine there
B	and where are you staying? what's it what's the place like?
A	er it's nice I've been there
B	oh good
A	yeah it's er a house
B	yeah?
A	yeah a proper house
B	that's nice
A	like on the edge of the city
B	be fun
A	er yeah so it's big erm yeah it'll be nice cos I'll have everything that I need
B	set up will they leave you food?
A	I don't know
B	probably not
A	they did offer to actually
B	wow
A	they said help yourself so I'll see what's there
B	so you'll have enough to live off for a time until you go shopping probably
A	yeah that's what I figure they'll probably leave milk and stuff in the fridge won't they?
B	yeah
A	and it won't keep till they get back so I might as well eat it
B	yeah
A	or
B	ah freezer
A	what's that?
B	told you I had a knife
A	oh that's funny
B	somewhere
A	oh
B	now we don't need it go out to dinner tomorrow night
A	that is too funny
B	mm probably I will just put that in the fridge it should keep shouldn't it for two days?
A	yeah I think if you can cover it so it doesn't dry out
B	yeah yeah
A	even if you cover it with this plate
B	oh okay
A	but then otherwise it just dehydrates doesn't it? and it gets a bit
B	that's true
A	nasty
A	yeah or a plastic bag even?
B	yes
A	could cover it with that
B	there's a bin bag here
A	yeah or a Sainsbury's bag or something
B	mm
A	not that I mean specifically Sainsbury's like a
B	oh is that gonna be okay?
A	supermarket I don't think there's a huge difference in quality
B	no
A	have they started charging you for plastic bags here?
A	yeah so it started here before England England starts in
B	yeah
A	October apparently
B	Wales was the first
A	oh right
B	and then here
A	Tesco
B	or maybe
A	it's good though
B	I think it's better and it really does work
A	yeah
B	like it
A	cos we are lazy
B	yeah
A	but England they're making stupid exceptions like small shops are exempt
B	oh
A	why? what is the point of that? why do small shops need more
B	well it's probably just cos they want to help the small shop
A	but how is that helping? I don't really understand that
B	yeah
A	yeah that's really
B	you're like
A	but can't they give you paper bags?
B	no you have to pay for them
A	what?
B	and I think that's wrong I think paper should be free
A	yeah oh this is dying gonna I'm gonna put this okay connect your charger
