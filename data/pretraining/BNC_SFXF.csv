A	I don't know if I've put the volume up
B	yeah it wasn't that far really
A	no
B	no
A	yeah
B	plus like you said we haven't got a very big team at the moment
A	no
B	why?
A	well if it's about TV or famous people
B	mm yeah
A	you need a couple of those
B	yeah yeah you've got to mix it up a bit
A	you just told yourself that you've got here
A	yeah it's pathetic isn't it?
B	looks like a erm one of those flat pack cars that you put together yourselves
A	A kit car?
B	mm
A	yeah
B	I don't know
A	no it's a Toyota
B	mm?
A	well that's what the wheel says anyway
B	well you have to buy some sort of wheels
A	no but it looks like a Toyota
B	does it?
A	yeah
B	how old is that?
A	eighties?
B	mm
A	I don't understand those two seaters
B	I know
A	yeah
B	you know
A	mm
B	can't get out all on her own
A	mm
B	but she can't
A	mm
B	so it's a bit useless really
A	well it's big enough for her and her dog isn't it?
B	yeah
A	it looks nice
B	what's happened?  What's happened?
A	when she came to meet us at Heathrow at that hotel
B	oh yeah
A	and then they they and then we had to go to the pub
B	that was an absolute nightmare
A	and they were like okay do you mind walking? Cos we've only got a two seater
B	and then we got stuck at the bus as well
A	yeah we did
B	Cos nobody could come pick us up in these two seater cars
A	yeah yeah
B	know what I was going to say? Is what happened about his car the other day? Cos I didn't hear all the news
A	mm
B	Cos he said it
A	no
B	why was he parked behind a palette?
A	I don't know
B	oh my god
A	and I think it it went through half of the engine as well
B	really?
A	and it's destroyed it
B	oh really
A	which is good
B	why?
A	well cos he'd lose his no claims wouldn't he
B	mm
A	erm so they've
B	so they're going to pay for it?
A	yeah they've put it into the garage
B	mm
A	they'll pay for everything
B	yep
A	so
B	it just depends on how long it's going to take to fix it
A	mm
B	who's fixing it? Somebody at work?
A	no
B	okay
A	I don't know with
B	mm
A	things might go wrong more frequently
B	mm
A	I don't know
B	no who knows? He'll buy a new car then won't he?
A	no
B	oh okay
A	no no god no
B	what banger?
A	he bought a little thing
B	did he? I'm getting really confused now
A	he's got a little run around car
B	they picked us up in the nice car
A	yeah that big four by four looking thing
B	oh right
A	which they stuck on credit
B	mm
A	no
B	we're funny aren't we cos we're
A	I don't know
B	I do quite like it
A	but I don't
B	but I do feel like I'm missing out sometimes on like a car or something like that
A	yeah
B	that's because we haven't got any friends
A	any then I realised I haven't got any batteries
B	what without it being switched on?
A	no I think it was switched on but
B	but you haven't looked at it
A	I haven't looked at it
B	yeah that's true
A	and and I don't know anyone who lives around here so I'm not exactly phoning anyone up saying oh do you fancy a pint? or whatever
B	no
A	yeah I need to get out of here
B	well I think tomorrow
A	it is it is crunch day tomorrow
B	erm if they don't contact us tomorrow I'm going to phone them
A	yeah
B	I nearly thought about phoning them today but I thought I'd wait for London correspondence
A	yeah cos ten o'clock will be what? Two o'clock there
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	definitely
A	yeah yeah I'll phone
B	yeah
A	we have got his number haven't we?
B	yep yeah we have got his number
A	er
B	that's weird isn't it? There's that little bit of
A	mm
B	it's weird isn't it?
A	mm
B	it's cos I don't use it very often
A	yeah
B	I'm not really a phone person
A	mm
B	but it made me think
A	mm
B	erm cos I don't like phones and things like that
A	mm
B	I like face to face better
A	yeah well me too
B	I find there's oh there's
A	mm
B	you just always feel like I've said something weird or they've not understood me
B	oh and they just
A	mm
B	I don't know
A	mm
B	whereas on this Facebook and stuff and on the telephone I find it really hard
A	mm mm
B	I find it really hard to
A	well I'm absolutely sick of Facebook
B	no don't close it because it's good for the old correspondents
A	oh god
B	why?
A	just irritates me
B	yeah I know
A	just the crap people put on it
B	well it's annoying there's so many other people and they're using it and and then
A	and then
B	like some people if you if you they don't get a message from you or from somebody they're they're offended
A	mm
B	and it's like well I haven't been on it for for two weeks or
A	yeah
B	why would I have sent you a message?
A	and then I I keep getting sent all these fucking things saying oh poor little
B	mm
A	pass this on otherwise you're a selfless bastard
B	mm
A	it's like for god sake
B	yeah it's horrible that people
A	yeah that's what it's like
B	but that doesn't mean like
A	well
B	it's just
A	it's idiotic
B	oh dear that's not very nice at all is it
A	well they don't now in this country
B	even even people who are religious they say it's okay if you want to pray at home
A	mm
B	the whole history
A	and if you've had
B	yeah I know it's not good
A	and then it's right there next to your new one so you've got all this history which is directly tied to the present and you can't escape it
B	yeah
A	I mean some people must be having nightmares with that
B	yeah
A	I don't like at all because it it it colours the the new message
B	it just pops up
A	it's not a fresh message
B	no
B	and I didn't speak to her since then
A	I'm going into the jungle cos I'm having a rough time
B	yeah do you remember? When we were in China and we said right
B	and we went we just travelled for days
A	we travelled about three thousand miles
B	and then finally got to to Sumatra and went in the jungle and sat there
A	yeah that was
B	but that was because we were enjoying
B	but she was off
A	oh it must have been
B	six
A	five years ago
B	yeah
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	and she doesn't either obviously
A	yeah and every time you message her she's going to go oh god yeah she never did bloody write to me in that jungle thing
B	no I mine was the last message so I'm pleased that mine was the last message cos
A	right
B	no but but that on the plus side you've you have got these
A	that that is the only plus side is that I've got into touch with people that I thought I'd lost
B	people that you can
A	but it was only
B	well it depends on you doesn't it?
A	well is there a way of getting their email address?
B	yeah
A	well I could ask for them couldn't I
B	I hardly use email these days
A	well no one does do they
B	apart
A	writing
B	I don't do anything like that
A	you don't even write anything
B	I don't do too much of that crap
B	I only do that
A	yeah
B	you know most of my friends wouldn't give two monkeys
A	but there's no effort is there
B	oh I like their picture
A	yeah but you can't live your life if you're trying to please people who care about stuff you couldn't give two hoots about
B	no I know
A	but if you look at half of your friends on Facebook I bet you don't give a damn about half of those people
B	no no I should clean it up really
A	but then you can't
B	it is really weird
A	why don't you want it?
B	because there's something about it
A	I haven't even looked at it
B	and erm them recording your
A	mm
B	right
A	but who gives a shit? Who gives a shit what I was doing last September?
B	what were you doing? It's it's basically a diary of your life
A	so you're looking in other people's diaries?
B	it's a diary with photos
A	well a diary with entries of five words at a time
B	but it but all the photos
A	yeah
B	yeah well I hate it
A	yeah
B	they were talking about making everybody do it but I don't know if that's true
A	well it will eventually won't it
B	I don't want it though
A	but they have to keep changing it that's the whole purpose
B	but I don't want it to change because once I know how to use something then I just want it to continue
A	mm
B	and like and you're supposed to know that
A	mm
B	if you've got security settings to say they can't look at my pictures then it should be stuck
A	mm
B	mm
A	well
B	we'd be arrested
A	well we did get cut off didn't we
B	like why why does it matter? Why does it matter that they have the information?
A	yeah because it basically have you heard that all of this stuff is going to these big vaults in the North Pole?
B	yeah yeah I've heard that
A	where you've got these underground storage facilities
B	such a big hard drive
A	but can you imagine the marketing possibilities
B	yeah but can you believe that they spend all of this
A	that's that's what it's about
B	but can you believe that this kind of marketing can produce so much revenue and so much money that it's worth it
A	well no because it's it's producing nothing
A	all
B	well it's seeing what kind of abstract shit people like
A	so if it's generating ideas or
B	mm
A	but when you're generating like marketing stuff that's just generating greed
B	mm
A	I don't know and then you've got all of these financial products
B	but Tom you've got to be really careful on your Google because I was on I was on it right
A	yeah
B	right
A	oh has it?
B	now it's just WWW but if you want high security
A	mm
B	it's now
A	what the phone number?
B	as soon as you sign into Google
A	it wants your phone number
B	no
A	hmm
B	to them building a profile of you
A	yeah
B	but HTTP used to be a normal thing that you used to see
A	mm
B	so now they're now on my Hotmail it flashes up
A	mm
B	it used to be that
A	hmm
B	with all of your data
A	mm
B	and storing while you're logged into Google
A	mm
B	and I'm stopping using Google Chrome
A	well I've noticed cos I was trying to do something the other day I can't remember what but I had to find out where Google Chrome was storing all of the information
B	mm
A	and it isn't it's not like Internet Explorer
B	storing what?
A	well storing the the cookies and all of the other stuff
B	well cos yeah with Google Chrome you have to delete it from the computer and then you delete it from the Google Chrome site as well
A	it's really weird
B	yeah
A	but I don't know
B	yeah
A	yeah but you know people would say oh that's convenient
B	it's not convenient because I because they're the companies that we don't want
A	mm
B	it's ridiculous
A	yeah
B	but that's why you've got to be really careful with Google now
A	mm
B	and now I think we should change to
A	well it's like
B	I don't like Google anymore
A	internet Explorer's really clunky and it's just horrible
B	clunky?
A	yeah
B	they're all the same
A	no they're not
B	really?
A	it looks ugly
B	well Mozilla Fox then
A	yeah okay
B	and you've just got to make sure that you always sign out from your Google account
A	mm
B	Cos of those
A	and I liked the Google one because
B	yeah
A	well only because we're here
B	well there was a glitch wasn't there
A	and I've got direct I've got a direct link to my email as well
B	mm
A	yeah
B	you only have to go on the Google homepage and it says gmail at the top
A	oh okay
B	no
A	okay
B	shall we? Are we going to walk back now?
A	are we going to have another one or are we walking back?
B	no
A	mm
B	it's nice I like it
A	it is a nice pub
B	if we go and speak to them in the pub and say hello and find out about the quiz and
A	well it says Wednesday
B	I know but we can say hello and say goodbye
A	yeah
B	yeah?
A	yeah okay
