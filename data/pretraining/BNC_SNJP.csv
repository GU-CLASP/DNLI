A	your group but I would have also your great uncle has offered his his band for free here
B	it was club music
A	it was it was a club
C	oh no
A	no it wasn't no erm
C	so they had this lovely traditional wedding and then club music?
A	it was a bit yeah erm but the the
C	yeah
A	and you erm
B	the gardens were fantastic
C	well that's the thing I think
A	yes it was constant we were getting
C	well it's gonna be quite different if you come to mine then
A	the gentry live but it's you you cut it to your own cloth that how the gentry lived in the er in the nineteenth century and erm it was lovely though and it was a nice beautiful day the weather was lovely on that day
B	yeah
A	and so everything was was perfect erm
B	they were really really lucky
A	yes
C	yes
B	it was the the Saturday before or the Saturday after? terrible
C	I mean I guess for
A	it's too if you no you
B	oh sorry that's where I put I booked the same table
A	cut the
C	so I wouldn't yeah but I wouldn't want
A	we'll put
C	something in between
A	no
C	I'd rather either have one extreme or the other
A	yeah but
C	I wouldn't rather be somewhere in the middle where I'm a bit like oh this isn't very tasteful or it's you know a bit cheapy
A	you you you can probably it's like it but you're so it's a very it it's a very expensive day it's you know
B	it can be a very expensive day
A	yeah no that's what I mean it can be you don't it doesn't have to be you know
C	well it's the cost of a the wedding
A	yeah I mean you need a
A	you need
B	no I just I'm just surprised that was
A	yeah
B	I've never because I've always been involved in a wedding where it's been er a a ceremony and everything else but I just think mm forty pounds for just a piece of paper
C	yeah and that's all we have to do for and that would have to be on a weekday
A	yes
C	it becomes two hundred pounds if it's the weekend
A	yeah
B	does it really?
C	yeah mm just to sign the piece of paper two hundred pounds just to sign a piece of paper
A	yes
B	do you not go through a ceremony or anything? it's literally just
C	erm we have to say some vows
B	are you talking about a registry office?
A	oh yeah there's vows
C	yeah
A	oh right you still go and do the registry office wedding
A	yeah it it's not just yeah
C	if if if we we wouldn't get married we would
B	a celebrate thing
C	yeah and and do something yeah
A	you you can
C	but at the moment it's pragmatic there's not
A	no
C	it's because we will need to for
B	yeah but you shouldn't
A	yes
C	knowing me what would you
C	what would you say I should do?
B	don't get married
C	just don't get married?
A	no but if he needs it for a job
B	if you have to for a job yeah definitely
A	yeah
B	but I think the way you speak I don't think you particularly want to get married you don't feel that you need to your bond that you have together is strong enough a piece of paper is gonna make no difference to you either way
C	mm
B	so what's the point?
A	so if it's if it's for a job then you
C	it's just like you're getting another degree certificate or something
A	you you you you take you take the the bare minimum and that's it you can have a celebration you could
C	you need
A	you have a slight dilemma because of how things have happened
C	I don't know who to invite is a problem
A	that's your dilemma
C	yeah it's a it's a really big dilemma because
B	you can invite everybody
A	well
B	just exactly the same as as erm
C	it's not
B	the two of us we had a photograph taken with them and
C	for a wedding I'd agree
B	that's it
C	but if we're just signing a piece of paper it's a long way for people to come yeah so
B	oh well for oh yes just for a piece of paper well it depends on whether you want to all go out for a meal
C	because we have to have witnesses don't we to do it?
A	if if
B	yes
A	if I mean if you want to
C	I've even told
A	yes
C	she has three brothers
A	yes
C	who all have wives who all have children
A	yes
C	they're not just gonna come all the brothers on their own that suddenly
A	yes
C	if I invite
B	well they're not gonna come in the week are they though are they really if it's in the week?
A	yes the the the price escalates
C	we were very tempted to just have a very very small selection of people let's say
A	mm
C	maybe her parents and then you guys and
A	yes
C	and
A	it's well don't if you if
C	yeah I know
A	I can't believe I'm saying that but
C	yeah I know
A	the but the my Libra scales must balance and there has to be balance
C	how would you feel if I didn't invite you
A	I would feel
B	if I didn't invite me? erm
C	if I just said it was just mum and dad that was it?
B	fine if that's what you want
C	it's not necessarily what I want it's just
A	there's there is a cost to this
C	it's just easier isn't it?
A	I I tell you a problem that I see here
B	you're I think you will you have more I mean I I go along I've always gone along with what
C	yeah
B	erm
A	I agree
C	yeah no definitely
B	it will er upset
A	I I don't myself and like I said with my scale of balances I I will never like
C	yeah oh yeah
A	are you with me? that I couldn't I could not sell I could try selling to you that you should invite
C	which is why for
A	yes
C	we were considering just her parents er my parents that's it no siblings
A	yes
C	no anyone else
A	yes
B	well that's if you wanted it the other option is just to choose two sets of close friends and just do it completely on your own
C	yeah we could just do it with friends couldn't we?
B	and then just have a family get together on one side
A	the thing is that's I understand it's all of the postcards
B	and a family get together and you can either decide to make it with
C	we could do that couldn't we?
B	with them and that way
C	we could travel around couldn't we?
B	nobody
C	I could I could go to
B	and I think
A	yeah right
B	that's right
C	yeah we hadn't considered that
A	no it's an option
C	that might be a good idea
B	that way you don't have to have anybody and it you won't be sitting there all day worrying that people are gonna feel like
C	it's not that I don't want
A	no no
B	no no I know but but it
C	it starts escalating doesn't it? it starts building
B	well it it it
A	it it becomes a
C	oh yeah definitely
A	and this
C	and then
A	this erm
C	and then I can't have four people and
C	but he was there when I proposed
A	yes he has to be there when
C	isn't that enough?
B	but he's already had that one
C	you know
A	he has to be there you may have to if you go down the line of
C	that's another like fifteen people
A	well yes
C	but it's a lot of it's it's a lot to ask of people to come all the way down there just to see us sign the paper
A	unless unless er unless
B	yeah but that's
C	I'm leaning towards that idea yeah
B	and then like I say you that way nobody's offended nobody's left out and nobody's more popular than anybody else
C	yeah and then everyone
A	it's still
C	doesn't have to travel down to
A	I it's still
C	we can travel to those
B	yeah
A	it's
C	no
A	but this is a big problem for mum
C	I just think cos don't want any child there so
A	no
C	if it were to happen
A	yes
C	I mean when when one child is there all the attention is on the child always er
A	it's a dilemma because
C	I mean it does doesn't it?
A	it's like erm
B	it does but there's a way round it
A	if you have a child or your brother has a child
C	no
A	my grandchild before I do are you with me? because that to me is wrong erm if
C	don't worry I'm not gonna have a child
C	I'm not gonna have one
C	no of course
A	I'm here and took
C	you're ancillary characters
A	fortunately
C	and you agreed
A	he's your father we agreed that that was wrong and
C	was it awkward for you
B	no because in the end and it it helped that the actual caterer adjusted it because of the layout of the room and how many they were allowed to have and how they set the tables out they're supposed to have a the top table and then eight tables of ten ten tables eight tables of ten they changed it and extended the top table so in the long run we all sat on the top table so
A	it also helps that er me and
C	does he have any relation to
A	yes yes
C	this this children's home
A	er ask me who who erm
C	mm
A	who is driving instructor was
C	very strange
C	mm very strange
A	yes it's all
B	and where's your
C	the way it's all
A	and it's very
B	pardon?
A	yes
C	the children's home I find it really strange
A	yes
C	at least on
B	he's got all the erm
C	this side of the family you weren't there mum worked there dad went there
A	mm
B	that's where I met your mum all those years ago
C	yeah
A	I said that I only know these people because of that home without that home I would you wouldn't exist
C	no no I know
A	if I hadn't gone there you would not exist because I'd have been in London and gone stayed at Watford or whatever
B	there you go
C	and again the problem is
B	mm of course you do
C	so it's not practical
A	the person you've got to manage
B	and
C	to a certain degree
A	er no I'm not
C	to a certain degree
B	no
A	no yes actually
C	yeah actually
C	and that's my problem I worry that I
A	yes
C	occasionally
A	yes
C	there are certain things where I I doubt myself and wonder and I try and talk to her about well of course I talk to her about it cos I don't wanna be leading the charge on something that she doesn't feel erm
A	what's her take on children?
C	er same as me really we both discussed the fact that probably part of us would definitely like to have children it's such
A	no
C	no not at all
A	well well that
C	and we've discussed we've said when we get to forty I think we'll have done everything we wanna do and we'll be in a good enough job and we'll be qualified enough to be able to give a child a good life but she may have hit the the menopause by then cos her family hit it quite young
A	it's not
C	her mum hit it at forty
A	it's not impossible
C	so we've talked about erm adopting honestly adopting we thought if we if er between here and then we don't feel ready to have a child then maybe when we get to that point we'll adopt
A	well though tasked with my with the erm the erm standard bearer of my genetic material
C	I'm sorry dad you say you don't put any pressure on me
A	no no no
C	but you do you do
A	I mean there's always the
C	you've told me before you want
A	yes although
C	because you keep saying well where would the mark in history be?
A	erm erm
C	he does put some pressure he does it kind of passively aggressively but you really do
A	but although your your brother might end up as being the the standard bearer
C	yeah
A	I don't know I mean you may not have children to be honest there is a very good argument not to have them I mean and there's an argument to have them
C	yeah
B	if if you both boys could land up having daughters and there still won't be one
C	yeah
B	so what's the as though
C	we'll pass on the genetic material but not the name
B	yeah but that's yeah
A	oh yeah the well
C	unless they don't change their name
A	it's it's erm
C	that's the thing
C	sorry say that again
C	that's yes that was yours yes
A	yes thank you
C	thank you very much that looks interesting
A	another one?
B	for her think that
C	thank you
B	thank you
C	I told you I had egg looks a bit different
A	yeah
C	but it looks good
B	no no no go on you tuck in I need a tiny little bit on the plate
C	are we all are we all gonna share?
B	yeah no no you
C	it should be like a yoghurty creamed
A	do you want a er piece of chicken off this?
B	no thank you you enjoy it
C	this is
A	it's an omelette in a
C	yeah it's like an omelette with some lamb and spiced lamb would you like some of it? we can
A	no I'm no I've got this
C	no please I can't eat er this is like a whole meal and I've got a whole
B	well you're joking look at that
A	mm very good
C	I thought we were sharing
A	yeah we are
C	I'll have a bit of yours you have a bit of mine
B	no honestly I leave me the little tiny bits at the end
C	the erm
B	to try them
A	there's another piece of meat
B	I'm hungry which is why I'm just nibbling at the poppadums
C	yeah
B	and that because I didn't have a cake or anything cos I didn't want to spoil it cos I when you go out and you're paying for something and you only eat half I just feel it would be a
A	mm
B	but I can't eat it now just literally can't
C	mm
B	but isn't the we erm when we went to erm Italy skiing on one er night erm my brother and his wife and erm
C	calzone?
A	calzagi
B	calzone calzone that's it
A	calzone calzone
C	yeah
B	erm and I'd never had one before
A	you got confused with
B	and I have never ever anywhere had a pizza like it have you ever had one?
C	it's folded isn't it?
B	yes
C	they're good
B	oh it's
C	so how was?
B	and it was in a creamy sauce and it was gorgeous it was so soft and and I've had them in this country and
C	not to be repeated
B	and even in in er even in Italian restaurants and they're nothing like so I think sometimes like you say you you had your expectation of what you thought that would be it's not what you had before is it?
C	it's still good
B	it's still well as long as it's good
C	it's obviously gonna be a bit better and where it's from and
B	of course
A	well yeah when you're having it in a country
C	and this will be kind of what Korea calls it fusion food this will be a mixture of India plus England so it's not just gonna be Indian food
B	no
C	it's gonna be suited out our palates
A	yeah
C	that's why there's
B	mm
A	yeah
C	you know you never have a salad with this normally
B	good are you enjoying it?
C	mm
B	yeah just just one little mouthful
C	yeah
B	so just so I can say that I had a taste
C	there you are
B	no honestly that's fine that

B	thank you
C	yeah?
B	that's lovely
C	and try a bit of dad's
B	is that hot?
A	no
C	would you consider that spicy?
A	no
C	I can't really tell I just I don't think it's spicy
B	there's no rush is there?
C	no
A	no
B	mm it is nice
C	mm
B	meat's a little bit dry
C	mm
B	for me
C	yeah
B	whatever we do
C	yeah dad's is dripping in everything
B	mm
A	have you done a erm have you used any of your lemongrass or erm the
C	I've made a mess on it
A	mm
C	would you like some more of this?
A	no I'm fine
C	go on just have one of of these
A	oh
C	does give a good
A	if erm
C	it's got a good
A	if you were staying here for more than a year I would have tried to grow you a kaffir lime but
C	mm
A	mm
C	yeah that's why erm I've been used to using dried so I put too many in when I did it last time
A	was it really limey?
C	it was good but
A	yeah
C	I forgot to put
A	really limey
B	overdid it
C	well yeah I think I put well what do you consider a leaf? the double bit?
A	yeah that's one leaf
C	or half of one that's one leaf
A	one leaf yeah
C	I put in three then
A	mm call it three
C	mm
A	mm you can see why our investors have been buying that
C	it's really good
B	did you have any last year for your birthday or was it the year
A	no the year
B	no it was the year before that?
A	it's two years old yeah
B	so it's two years old
A	yeah
B	oh right
A	I remember the first year I I I bought one it died it was too small I've got a bigger one now and it survived
B	mm
C	mm it was good
A	if you don't you don't
C	produce
B	this is the dilemma that
A	for what?
B	until she finishes her erm
A	I don't know she's
B	till she qualifies to gets her
A	she's a she's a registrar now
unknown_female	have you finished your start?
C	yes thank you very much
A	yes lovely thank you what even if she wanted to become a consultant
B	yes yeah
C	thank you the problem there are things that get in the way you can't have a child at that point
B	well this is it that's what she says
A	can we have er do you want another beer? have another one
C	I'm alright with this one you have another one
A	can I have another erm Cobra please?
unknown_female	is that a pint or a bottle?
A	er pint please
unknown_female	a pint of Coburn and you're okay with your
C	yeah I'm alright thanks
A	no I'm fine thank you
C	yeah things get in the way
B	into care yeah cos otherwise what's the point?
C	no that's what I think
A	but your mum she's a
C	yeah you know get the
A	trouble is you're gonna be living a very long way away and it won't be practical
C	and if we want to work as lecturers in a university I need to be producing research and research is not easy to do or I can't
A	no
C	imagine how you'd do that with a child doing conferences and going round the country
A	no have you broached the subject with her?
C	it just doesn't compute
A	about children
C	with who?
A	with your mum
C	oh yeah I've as and being as I've been as frank with mum as I'm being with you
A	what's her take on this?
B	is she disappointed?
A	she it's part of the
B	because at the end of the day it's it's your dream
C	mm
B	that your children will carry on the same lifestyle that you have and they'll get married and they'll have children so that you have grandchildren but I think as life society changes you begin to think well life's different now we didn't go abroad and do all the sort of the you know working abroad and that like you've done so maybe it won't happen
C	it changes I mean I think at the same time yes she's disappointed but I think she'll also if I do achieve what I'm setting out to achieve hopefully she'll be proud
B	yeah
A	oh she'll be proud
C	you know regardless of having children
A	it it it's the erm
C	and if I if I adopted could you do you think you can love an adopted child?
A	er
C	like your own grandchildren?
A	well
C	I mean there are children now that don't have parents
A	I have two like adoptive sons so I've kind of got round my head round that so erm yeah obviously there's a there's a er a
B	well the other bit the other take on that is the fact that one or the other of you mightn't be able to have children
A	yes well yeah
C	which is which we've considered
B	so therefore the only way you could have a family erm is is to adopt
A	yeah er is is to adopt yeah
B	so why shouldn't er any other it should just be the same it's yours
C	and when I look around and think of all the children who don't have parents
A	yeah
C	I mean
B	I just think that I mean I always laugh at this is that I would like to adopt erm and have another child and then I think you have to be I I wasn't wouldn't have been a strong enough person to accept that that child
A	no
B	thank you
A	although there isn't with your own children either
C	no
B	well there isn't but
A	you can stick with blood
B	you can have some it's like
A	you'll stick with blood a
C	it's definitely erm
A	it's your it's your
C	what a mixture of the two of us would look like
A	your your your problem your not your problem your your dilemma will be your your mortality er your legacy erm you've will pass on the baton on your what your like I said your mindset now my mindset at your age is totally different to my mindset now my mindset at your age would despise what I've turned into I quite like what I've turned into but this is talking to my my twenty-eight year old
C	you're a different person
A	I'm a different my confidence was like the same but my
C	well what about if we have different philosophies what if I don't feel if I feel a genuine connection to everyone on this planet what if I thought like oh lovely thank you
A	thank you
C	my legacy might not necessarily have to be imparted through my own biology
A	no
C	that I
A	no
C	feel more of a kinship with with the people around me
A	yes you you might your legacy might be something totally different you might er have something written or something like that and er and you'll have a legacy in a different way
C	this is the first thing this that is cementing me in history
A	mm
C	if anyone ever in the future looks back and wants to go what did the British public sound like in two thousand and fourteen? we are all recorded
A	yes
C	this has probably cemented us in history more than anything else that we've ever done
A	yes
A	account
C	I hope that's not real
B	it is real
C	I mean they're only gonna
C	give money to you right? they can't take money from you
C	but seriously I mean
A	mm
A	erm
C	I thought that was quite interesting
A	I think it's erm
C	that's your legacy
A	the it depends
B	that's strange wouldn't it to think that grandchildren sorry again it's that but grandchildren would look back and something would come out of that and and turn around and say that's my
A	yes well
B	yeah
C	it will be they don't have many I mean it's a large project but they sent out a global email to me the other day with everyone else that's involved in the course there's only other one hundred people in the whole country doing this so there's not that many of us
A	no
C	and they're now asking us where are you doing this? because they're looking for any gaps in the country
A	yeah
C	so I am covering well I kind of told them it's a bit it doesn't seem right because actually I'm living in
A	yeah Bedfordshire and Northamptonshire
C	told them that really my area is
A	yeah
C	is that area so we will be the as far as I know they don't have anyone else recording from this area so eventually they'll make a map
A	yeah
C	and the map will have lots of points on it and you'll click on a point and it'll have a recording from that area so you will be in the archive
A	we'd better make sure we don't drop our Hs and and
B	they're not going they're not taking what we've said you said they're only they're not going to play back what we've said are they?
C	I mean people will be able to listen to it
B	you said that it wasn't that it was
C	I said that they're not they're not paying any attention to what you're saying but it's it's for use
B	well of course they will
A	I don't think
C	they're not gonna know who you are there's no name attached and any time that we mention each other's name that will taken out so there's no
A	right in in fifty years' time
C	your identity is protected
A	they won't be paying much
C	it's the pronunciation they're focusing on the pronunciation
A	yes yes
C	and words that you use
A	yes
C	and that kind of stuff but they they've told us and part of the sheet that you signed
A	yes
C	they're saying that all of your personal identities
A	yes
C	will be discarded
B	I was going to say yeah
A	I hope that
C	they won't know who you are
A	I don't I don't want to sound
C	but your voice will be there for history
A	yeah I don't want to sound bombastic but I hope my words are bigger that maybe the
A	the syllables of my words are big enough to
C	a linguist would argue there is no judgement here
A	yeah
C	and that's what you should aim for anything else is just incorrect it's wrong it's poor elocution but linguists would argue that there's no such thing and you describe language and there are so many variations and you I mean I've been selling
A	pigeon English
C	for these kind of things yeah erm but actually when you study it linguistically it's as much a fully formed language as any other language it's just different
A	mm
C	they use tense modality and aspect markers they have their own grammar they have everything there's a set
A	erm
B	inflections?
A	in in
B	like this er yeah or like you put er over when you're using French
A	an emphasis or something like that?
C	inflection's grammatical so
A	yeah
C	plurality if I say dog and then I say dogs
A	yeah
C	the S is an inflection we don't use much inflection when I say I play you play he plays the only one that's inflected is the third person he plays
A	yeah
C	in Spanish it's
A	yeah
C	they they indicate gender plurality they indicate all sort of functions through inflection
A	mm
C	we don't have that so for a long time grammarians said the best languages are ones with high inflection the Latin languages
A	mm
C	but we turned around and go well why is that? why is a language that has less inflection we still
B	mm
C	a a human language will cover every avenue possible the only difference is some languages have fewer words than other languages some languages have more consonants or more vowels but again you can't really use that as a basis to argue that one language is
A	yeah
C	which when you study the language you
A	well the
C	they ought to
A	the ultimate erm er aim for a language is to communicate
C	yeah absolutely
A	if you're talking in a language that no one else understands
C	I've confused it a little bit though when I said about pigeons a pigeon
B	yeah that's right a bit of this and a bit of that isn't it?
A	yeah
C	the it's it's structured they have a structure because there are different there's a continuum of pigeons they're
A	yeah
C	and it's actually the children that create the grammar but it's part of our language faculty the children realise that they are missing they they don't have the right words for things
A	so if
C	so they fill it in
C	so there are fillers in
C	so a creole used to a pigeon
A	yeah
C	so effectively yes you could say a pigeon is simpler but a creole isn't it's no different
A	yeah
C	how did we get onto this conversation what were we talking about?
A	er not sure
C	I've just reeled on
A	er probably because I said about bombastic er that
C	oh yeah you
A	it's a your no
C	oh yeah you oh yeah okay so they're not gonna be analysing the kind of words of you're using
A	I I know how to use the language but its its construct
C	you have a tacit understanding of of language
A	yeah your on your knowledge of er the construct is far superior to mine and I have to smile because
C	whereas that was probably the main part of your job
A	a girlfriend taught me how to do that and it's I it took me three goes to do it I got a D with it the first time an E the second
A	and that's why I went for down E
C	went down the second time on the attempt
A	but then a third attempt I got a C it it it pleases me to know that that from my generation to yours from a person who could not write er because I've been I'd been writing what I thought were love letters but clearly the recipient was thinking this is a load of rubbish
A	there's no syntax no grammar no nothing and you know in her own way kind of said
B	do it just like that
A	to to to be to really analyse the the language and it's and it's
C	and it's my job
A	yes exactly but when I look back at your father
C	yeah
A	he came out of the school system and I I didn't know where full stops went commas inverted commas semi colons
C	yeah I mean that's what should happen shouldn't it?
A	no
C	you should improve on your your your forbearers and you should
B	you don't think that if
A	well the improvement there was a there was if I hadn't of if I had not
A	if I had not of erm done that the it would be like you would might as well say that your your father was illiterate I could communicate verbally well I was illiterate I couldn't
C	what do you think about negative concord? I don't do nothing
A	no I I would say I don't do anything not nothing
C	yeah that would be what we consider correct the concord
B	the correct way of saying it
A	yeah I'd say anything yeah yes
C	do you think negative concord is is bad if you heard somebody say like don't do nothing?
B	yes well it's not it's not bad is it? it just
A	it's not descriptive
B	no you can there are so many words in this language think of the one that you could use better there's there's like a lovely
C	we do that today with
B	mm
A	yes
B	yes
C	but we just stick very in front of everything
B	yes
A	yes
C	that's a complaint that teachers have that people aren't using the their poetic
C	I would agree with that and I don't think a linguist would disagree with that I think you know we do have these words at our disposable one when argue that we do have antonyms but there are no synonyms we'll and although you think that there are synonyms there aren't no two words are exactly identical they have slightly different connotations slightly different register
A	mm
C	therefore we can use we should and I think I
B	yeah but you never know when you're going to do
A	I I
B	when you're going to be able to use them do you?
A	yeah
B	I mean you throw words in something and I think oh right
A	I I do if I
B	is this to muck around?
A	if I if I get upset or I feel erm
C	you get cornered
A	I the my words
C	I bet he loved you after that
A	it took him a few years to forgive me for that yeah but I felt I felt cornered and the more cornered I felt the more upset I became was starting to use big er bigger words because I'd er used the words as weapons against you thinking you won't actually know what it is I'm talking about it
C	and people do that don't they?
A	and so I used overzealous aspect it was it was in the right connotation for the phrase but he didn't understand what it was I've just said
C	yeah
A	so er yeah er so I I then became even more bombastic and said right if you can't understand this then why don't we speak in another language? I'll accommodate you either way erm but that that's it goodnight
C	now the er er type of stylistic variation we accommodate we converge or diverge from the speakers that are around us we usually converge we like to sound more like the people around us so we have an affinity with those people
A	I do at work
C	but you can also do the opposite you can diverge because right at the moment I'm angry with you and I don't wanna sound like you I want to sound
A	yes
C	either superior to you or below you or whatever
A	yeah sooner er but I don't wanna be inferior
C	I don't wanna
A	no you're gonna start to do that
C	so that that's convergence back to what I was saying about negative concord I don't have nothing sounds terrible to us
A	yeah
C	but in most languages in the world Spanish
A	yeah
C	I don't have nothing
A	well yeah yeah
C	it's exactly the same translation there is nothing wrong and in fact in middle English we use negative concord grammarians neo grammarians turned around and said that's wrong you can't do that and it's through these er prescriptive grammarians that went around and said an adjective must end L Y
A	yes
C	they presumed so they went back and decided to spell the words and they presumed that it was from the Latin
A	yes cos it's they so it's
C	they did it incorrectly
A	it's a
C	there are lots of things the word knight used to be pronounced
A	yeah yeah
C	lock like a
A	yes so it's gone
C	so it's why do we have these conventions? when I first got with
A	we was
C	she she says not so much anymore because I
A	yeah yeah yeah
C	she'd say it all the time
A	yeah for teaching English you can't use that no
C	I spent some time with her mum recently her mum does not have the word were in her lexicon she doesn't say it
A	no
C	she just say I was you was we was
A	yeah
C	and that's regional that's
A	yeah
C	part of her dialect that's just
A	yeah
C	what they do if you go up north there are certain places in Scotland that I've read about that use double modal auxiliary verbs modal auxiliary verb can could shall should may might well well would so for example they'll say a sentence I would could do that which to us sounds ridiculous
A	yes
C	I should might be able to
A	one thing that that
C	but there's nothing wrong linguists er would argue that it's that every dialect er provided they can communicate everything nothing is wrong the
B	well
A	I'll learn all the time yes yes
C	yeah yes
B	not I'll learn you to do something
A	I the ones that irritate me especially if you hear it on TV people keep saying er you know or right and they're using it
C	discourse markers
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	you know you know you're right you're right right right right and you're going
C	yeah
A	but they're saying it well yeah you know I know all about
C	there's nothing to be sorry about
A	yeah you haven't done anything wrong
C	yeah
A	and that really
A	you haven't done anything wrong so why are you apologising? yet they do it it they use the word to go
C	have you noticed that certain words have taken on the opposite meaning as well? the word literally people use literally now but it actually they're using it to mean figuratively but they'll
A	right
C	but they'll use it they use it to mean the opposite
A	yes
C	I literally love that guy that's figuratively
A	yes
C	but I don't really love him but they use literally to mean the opposite of what it actually means
A	well one the one of the words they don't like
C	it's very strange
A	that is supposed to be like if you're saying that it's really good you now say it's sick
C	yeah that's been around for a while yeah
A	that's that's ridiculous
C	it's a bit of a
A	you see a connection with that a cockney
C	I mean we can argue it's ridiculous but is it? words change people use different things language varies
A	evolves
C	I mean it it does evolve it doesn't stop it never never stops
B	er it doesn't stop evolving
A	oh I thought you said
C	yeah it's very strange but I had to I had to break down those rules myself because I definitely would tell
B	oh yes yeah
C	in these areas so I mean I personally have always really disliked the Birmingham accent
B	oh yeah yeah
C	I think it sounds terribly uneducated
B	brummie
C	yeah like well but apparently it was one of the poorest of areas of England for quite a while and so we have this affiliation with them being poor and therefore their accent being stupid and we just but they've done a test on foreigners and they get foreigners to listen to different British accents they really like the Birmingham accent there's no there is nothing negative about the way they speak there is nothing inherently negative about it
B	I think it's again that's one of the things that that's gets muddled up and thank you
C	do you use flat adverbs? so for example do you say hold tight or hold tightly?
unknown_female	Kashmiri jal?
C	yeah
B	erm that's
C	just put them all out and we'll share them all I think
A	yeah
B	erm
unknown_female	and gulab jamum?
C	that was the gulab
unknown_female	sag aloo?
C	thank you very much
unknown_female	one garlic naan
C	have you got a garlic naan as well?
A	erm back on this
B	no I think we must
A	it's one of the two
C	I thought you did
B	have you? is it?
A	yeah it's two
C	oh no
A	no no I
B	alright
A	no well I'll have a bit
C	we've only just got one yes
unknown_female	two mushroom fried rice
C	excellent
B	yes
A	yes I didn't get
C	well please have some naan
A	I I I forgot to order a
B	no
unknown_female	one mushroom rice
C	lovely thank you
B	great
A	it's definitely hard to break those barriers down so yeah do you say hold tight or hold tightly?
unknown_female	enjoy your meal
C	thank you
B	well it depends on what erm what I think I would say hold tight
C	that would be incorrect apparently if you follow the conventions of grammar
B	oh okay
C	you're using an adverb to modify the form hold tightly should be the word speak slowly hold tightly
B	yes but if you're
C	if you say hold tight
B	if you were say you're like if you're putting a child onto a ride it sounds a bit silly to say hold tightly
C	it does yeah
B	doesn't it?
C	but that's not the way we say it
B	it's hold tight yeah
C	and traditionally in the eighteenth century we used they're called a flat adverbs we and Americans use them a lot my friends will often say speak slow they won't say speak slowly
A	slowly yeah yeah
C	they say speak slow erm I'm actually tempted to do my dissertation in flat adverbs
A	mm
C	because I've noticed more of a usage so I'm tempted to do a synchronic analysis of British public to see whether or not we are using more I can do a synchronic analysis by firstly analysing the youths and then analysing the elderly if the elderly don't do it but the youth do that suggests that it's changed
A	yeah
C	if the elderly don't do
A	yeah
C	but the youth do so therefore there's synchronic change
A	yeah
B	would you like some rice?
C	not much more rice I'm okay thank
A	yeah there's no mushroom there er
C	yeah there is
A	well there's not much
C	I'm
A	which one's mine? I'm not sure
C	that one's yours
A	oh okay
C	but would you like to share?
A	yeah yeah
C	if I have a bit of yours
A	I think that's why it's good like this cos we can all share that
B	would you like some potato this erm sag aloo?
C	yeah I'll try a little bit
A	I don't like the brummie accent
C	no
A	yeah
C	as a people there's no real justification for that
A	no
C	foreigners will listen to a variety of accents and they actually quite like the Birmingham accent there's nothing inherent within the sound that is negative
A	no
C	it's purely our own negative connotation
A	yes yes
C	through the society
B	so what what is this one?
C	this is a chicken jalfrezi
B	but what is that hot?
C	tomato bit of spice it's not well shall I try it and then I'll let you know?
B	yeah what's yours like?
A	erm
B	no that's chicken that's never lamb that's chicken that's lamb isn't it?
A	I I've got a bit of either
C	I think they're both chicken in here
B	oh are they?
C	yeah they're both chicken
B	oh right
C	let's see how spicy it is
A	oh of course
B	yeah I was saying they don't look sort of
A	well it's chicken it's er like chicken on the bone
B	that's right yeah
C	erm just
B	right okay
C	yeah I would say
A	right well
B	I'll eat mine
C	please take some naan I can't eat the whole thing
B	no I'm fine thank you
C	it's interesting how words have changed over time as well
A	mm
C	yeah very strange
A	we don't use the words like betwixt no er begat
C	we used to have other pronouns like thee thine
B	thy
A	like thou
C	no we don't use them anymore thou yeah
A	yeah
C	they're only really used now in religious ceremonies
A	yeah yeah
C	they don't really use them otherwise can I have a bit of yours?
A	yeah go ahead see
C	I mean about
A	yeah
C	of French origin
A	mm well it's dispersed
C	yeah
A	it's like French words are like cul de sac erm
C	but our grammar is still more Germanic
A	yeah
C	we are of the proto indo European age it's very strange to think that our language is directly connected to India we're of the same language family
A	yes
C	which I find very strange
A	you have er a bungalow er keep these are these are erm Indian words
C	mm
A	you know in our language
C	yeah it's quite good
A	erm you a lot of people
C	that's not because it's of the same family though
A	no
C	that's cos we've colonised er
A	yeah yeah
C	to speak
A	for speak it comes from
C	yeah Parliament
A	Parliament
C	m'aidez
A	help me
A	cos I couldn't understand it before was why a mayday a day in May was a distress
C	m'aidez
A	then it made perfect sense
C	help me
A	help me yeah
C	I do find etymology quite interesting
A	yeah yeah
C	sometimes we don't know we just don't know
A	right
C	I couldn't do a masters if I didn't find it interesting
A	no no
C	you know
A	yeah
C	it's a bit weird to think that
A	yeah
C	suddenly I'm a linquist
A	mm
C	but actually quite a few linguists don't speak a variety
A	they just speak their own
C	we can understand language
A	yes
C	and we can break down language
A	yeah
C	but you can't necessarily speak a variety of languages
A	no
C	however I feel like if I am a linguist then I should be able to speak a few languages
A	yeah
C	I want to at least be able to speak French and Spanish
A	yeah
C	don't how much French there is though in English
A	erm I was discussing with your brother because he was you know coming up with a few Spanish words that he'd learnt while he was over there
C	oh that's good
A	and he was
C	he's
A	say again?
A	er no not at the moment no
C	no?
A	erm
C	I spoke very good French
A	yeah yes you did but erm more importantly I did understand you
C	my Spanish is very quickly going erm
A	sorry?
C	I'm very quickly losing my Spanish
A	yes if you don't use it hence that's why I don't speak it
C	you have to have some respect for translators somebody that can sit there
A	yeah
C	so they're talking or writing while they're hearing what's being said
A	yeah
C	they have to not only translate but work out
A	yeah
C	so you've gotta listen to the whole sentence
A	before you know what it is
C	before you know what it's about
A	yeah yeah
C	and yet they've gotta translate and they're doing it very you know potentially you know there are some very precarious scenarios
A	yeah
C	and they can't mistranslate this because
A	they have to be aware er er a sentence produced wrong could maybe
C	could start a war
A	yeah exactly yeah
C	so it's I I have a lot of respect for that job
A	kind of I have no pressure no pressure there then
C	it's good though it's tasty
B	that'll be yours
A	yeah is yours alright?
B	I've got half of a load of rice there
C	yeah
B	I'm gonna struggle now I'll let you
A	yeah I'll
C	can I nick a bit?
A	no I'm fine mm got mange tout
C	I'll take it home then
C	oh you didn't like it?
A	oh no
C	it grows on you it grows on you
A	no it wouldn't grow on me
C	he didn't like that at all I took him to a couple of restaurants that were like
B	oh I know he didn't yeah
C	and he was like
B	no I said to him well what's so how did you get on with the food did you enjoy it? as I say he's not a fish lover either
C	no
B	so it's just quite
A	was it not
C	of course dad wants to go to a fast food burger restaurant
B	oh he's right if you don't have a McDonald's it's not he has to have a McDonald's in erm you didn't
C	oh god really?
B	yeah
A	only like cos er I had the snack not for your main meal
C	the main no of course
A	no not for your main meal
C	of course you bring shame to the name
A	if you want a
C	I must admit I have a bit of a I do like their McFlurry
B	yeah I do
C	yeah
B	about the only thing I do like
C	every so often
A	now which one's the really hot one? I can't remember one of them's really quite
C	spicy
B	yours and that you ordered
C	I'm not surprised he didn't like Kimbap it is seaweed wrapped rice with a bit of crabstick in the middle and some maybe some tuna or something else
A	no
C	I would never have eaten that stuff if it
A	you liked it
C	yeah I do like it I still like it today the tuna's the best one
A	mm
C	not very good
A	really?
C	er well it's horrible
B	crab's a shellfish
C	no I don't like crabs
B	oh right
C	that that bit of crabstick in in the Kimbap I I don't really taste it so I can
A	they're lost in the process
C	yeah yeah I'm fine with that but I've had have you ever had soft shell crab? like where you eat the whole crab pincers legs everything? it's not as soft shelled as they make out it was like eating a cockroach
A	yeah oh
C	it was just crunch crunch crunch
B	oh no I couldn't eat the shell
C	it was horrible that was my first meal in Korea they took us to this fancy restaurant and they were right so all like and of course I'm around a lot actually
B	oh
C	it was horrible
C	I really really did
A	some of the stuff you had to eat yeah
C	I had dog twice
A	oh no
C	liver kidneys dog liver dog kidneys
B	oh yeah I can eat
C	I had dog tail
B	do you remember what was
A	yes pigs ears they didn't like them that that was a sheep
B	it was no it was a
C	and I've I erm my coaches used to take me out for pig face soup
A	what?
C	pig face
A	oh
C	and the first time I had it an eye and an eyebrow floated up I had an eyebrow in my soup
A	oh oh my god
C	actually pig face soup's quite nice I I then later had with the same coaches pig trotters which was horrible
A	yeah
C	it was like white and it really was and then even worse than that he took me for pig skin soup
A	like like like like
C	yeah all the skin yeah
A	yeah like the skin
C	it wasn't very nice
A	I don't think I could eat that cos it's expensive
A	no I'm sure we could
C	I've had worse out there have you have you ever eaten jellyfish?
A	no
C	that's not particularly nice
A	no
C	it's the shellfish that really gets me did you hear mum got stung by a weever fish?
A	your mum did?
C	yeah
A	when? in Spain?
C	when she went to Devon with
A	in in Devon?
C	with
A	how did she get well had she
C	yeah I think they went not long ago have you ever heard of a weever fish?
A	yes yes
A	yeah oh yeah
C	they're quite bad apparently
A	yes it's er it's a fish that's erm
C	it was on her bum
A	oh
A	oh god I pity the thought of the person who had to suck the poison out
C	she was telling
A	ah she sat on it oh did she have to go to hospital with it?
C	I can't remember she said it was really painful for a few days she's broken her foot actually
A	what?
B	at the moment?
C	yeah she's been like that for like the last couple of months
A	I tried to I passed her
C	she broke her toe
A	oh right
C	she'd got it bandaged up you should see it she's like she's still getting about because there's nothing she can really do about it but
A	yes I I drove past her on the way to pick you up she must have been picking
C	the same trip
A	no I don't
C	she fell down those really steep steps
A	oh
C	and broke her toe
A	ouch
C	and of course having
A	no
C	had she rested her foot
A	yes yes
C	no I haven't been to
A	I know
C	you guys split up a don't think
A	no
C	I still have loose contact with grandad I always liked grandad
A	yeah did he remarry?
C	well he's not married he'd with a lady called
A	yeah
C	she's nice but mum was a bit iffy about seeing her for quite a bit
A	no
C	now I met her pretty much as soon as I
B	why will
C	I don't know
A	I don't think she was a great
C	well it's cos she's a
A	I mean that was that was no er erm
C	she claims that it's because she came out as being gay and he didn't want anything to do with her
A	yeah
B	no
C	oh why?
B	and you just think how can you be so awful for a woman who lost her husband?
C	she needs to move move she needs someone
B	he needs she needs someone and you think there was absolutely nothing more to it than just companionship
C	and even if there was and if there's been a period of mourning
A	yes
C	and time has moved on
A	I was gonna say I
C	you can't be alone for the rest of life you can't
A	no
C	I mean if you're gonna do that you might as well sati the Indian style and throw yourself on the funeral pyre
A	and and as well yeah
B	well if that's what you do and my sister's doing fine erm sixteen years now on her own
C	no I agree
A	plus it's not like she with your grandad must have to have this relationship with
C	no
A	you know
C	I am stuffed
A	your mum really
C	yeah no that's why I didn't have a problem with it at all
A	no
C	wouldn't you rather he be happy?
A	yes
B	yeah
C	it must be hard enough that he's lost his his love of his life
A	yeah that's right yeah
C	his other half I can't imagine what that must be like to
A	oh yes and I I'm sure your grandad
C	I mean he didn't force her anyone I think hopefully he was quite pleased that I was happy to see her immediately
A	yeah
C	I I actually made an effort to say I wanted to see her and
A	yeah yeah fine yeah
C	I wanted to chat and so
A	well yeah
C	I think I met her in my second year of
A	yeah
C	so I met her very early
A	yeah
C	I mean she's not my nan I don't know who she is really but
A	no
C	she's making my grandad happy so therefore
B	yeah
A	by by proxy yes
C	but I'm not I don't have such strong emotional ties to people anyway so
A	no
C	it's difficult it's it's difficult to say it's some people are very emotionally tied up
A	yes see I think that your mum and her sister would have been you know
C	not impossible
A	not insurmountable no
C	erm
B	well
C	for them
B	yeah for them and things that they they like and if you've got your you're going to make things uncomfortable then
C	it's what humility and selflessness is
B	yeah
C	turning round and going okay I feel this but I can play this down because
B	yeah
C	my feelings don't outweigh your happiness
B	that's right definitely that's right
A	there's erm although
C	oh yeah
A	there's some become
C	so because she went down recently so they met up with him then
A	oh is she stayed there then?
C	no no no nobody stays with them
A	oh right
C	as far as I know
A	but
C	well it's the shame because it's the only way I could go and visit him is if he allowed me to stay with him
A	right yes
C	but I don't know if the offer is there or what
A	yes
C	I'm sure it would be
A	yeah he was always private yeah
C	you can respect that so he'd jar people
A	yes probably
C	he probably struggled it's so difficulty within our family because we're not a private family
A	no no I mean
C	yeah in our house in our house now as well basically all the men
A	yeah
C	just disappeared you've disappeared from my family very much
A	yeah mm
C	as I said the
A	I
C	oh am I? it's just a matter of time
A	think think think on your position cos you're next
C	oh it's him that's reacting poorly now
A	yeah
C	the erm he's not building any
A	no he
C	he has grandchildren right and he's got
A	right
C	he's he he ignored
A	yes I
C	the problem is when you have another half that is very demanding and
A	and influences you yeah for a time
C	and I guess from his perspective he thinks well I've done this part of my life and I need to it's all about me now
A	yeah I thought a near death experience might have yes brought him closer to his family but
C	maybe it pushed him further away rather than pushed him
A	oh yeah I think
C	it it seems to
A	it it does seem an interesting
C	come in dear tuck in
A	I'm full up it does seem an interesting
C	full? are we sure?
A	yeah it does seem an interesting erm reclamation that erm if you're gonna get the
C	no erm I don't hear much about him and I also
A	what who was he did he exist? he must have been there for some some brief time moment in time
C	go on
B	no I can't I
C	go on you can do it
A	I'm gonna have a tiny bit but I'm quite I'm quite I am quite full
C	a little bit there it's just a little bit look I I've done a good job on there actually see the trick is can you do it with one hand?
A	no
C	you can't use both
A	no I can't
C	if you're in India you can't use both
B	why not?
C	they this is
A	one hand for the toilet one hand for the
C	so you take the naan and rip it with your hand and eat out of it
B	oh no
C	you can't use two
A	that's why in Who Do You Think You Are? they anything with the families was considered erm impolite
C	it took a while to get
A	oh go on
B	no thank you
C	it's also very messy as well I mean certain parts of India I ate curry with my hand
A	mm
B	yeah we were watching it on the television when they were travelling around yeah
A	southern India
C	yeah southern India
B	oh like yeah you
C	you get it on a banana leaf
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	you get the banana leaf and then you get all your stuff and then you have a little bowl of water to wash your hand in and
A	yeah and then you throw the leaf in
C	it's I mean it's tasty the around there they argue that half of the flavour is in the texture and I mean to an certain degree when I eat an apple you know half of you know I enjoy holding it and I enjoy eating it so I I can understand that to a certain
A	mm
C	part of the process is holding it
A	yeah
C	and eating it so they just feel the same about eating curry
B	I don't think it's very yeah a burger's dry
C	so it takes some getting used to to to be a
A	and also it can't be too hot either can it?
C	no
A	if that's in your hand
B	but don't you find that? that the only fault that I've had
C	it's not no well
A	didn't it come on hot trays?
B	yeah
A	it's er it's still for hot
C	I mean Korean food quite often comes out in a ceramic clay pot still bubbling and you'll get it out and it'll bubble for another couple of minutes while it's sitting it's actually kind of tedious because you want it
B	yeah
C	and you have to wait for it to stop bubbling and then another few you know five minutes longer
B	the two or three dishes they brought out you can hear them sizzling in the pot when they bring them
C	I guess they do that to prove that it's been cooked here and now and it it's
A	yeah yes it's er what's the word? er is it a la carte?
C	no
A	erm
C	food options in Korea as well
A	yeah
C	that are cold have you ever had cold noodles?
A	no I haven't
C	it's very strange
A	is it quite rubbery?
C	it's called
A	oh no I
C	it's very very strange
A	oh no I wouldn't that's like
C	it was never my favourite it's a summer food
A	yeah
C	they'd eat it in the summer
A	your palate's definitely broader than ours
C	but I never actually liked it
A	oh
C	I ate cos they give you a really big bowl of it
A	right
C	there's a lot of noodles in there
B	I don't like noodles
C	the first half was good I enjoyed the first half by the second half of the dish I'd be kind of like oh
B	they don't have a lot of flavour though do they?
C	the noodles themselves don't no the noodles themselves don't
B	no I
A	oh oh yes yeah that's in Spain they have that
C	I've never tried it
A	no it
B	no
A	it looks it looks awful it's black kind of like the meal was black
B	it's so
A	cos it's
C	yeah
A	that really looks unappetising
C	it looks unappealing yes we don't eat many things that are black do we? or what do you eat that's black?
A	er well it's normally
B	olives
A	it's normally
A	so black sausage
C	no I don't
B	or black pudding
A	yeah that's what I mean black pudding
C	so there a couple of things
A	I can eat that
C	is that black?
A	I can eat
B	yeah
A	the outer bit is black
C	is that with blood?
A	yeah
B	I yeah it's the actual cooked blood that's why it's black
A	like a
C	they have as similar dish in Korea called
A	yeah
C	cooked blood in
A	yeah
C	in soup is is great
A	we've certainly tried a
C	I like organs
A	I love
C	liver's really good
B	oh I love liver and onions and bacon
C	liver
A	yeah that was
B	I don't know
C	mm liver's good
A	lamb's liver is very very erm
C	but it's how again isn't
B	yes
C	you have?
A	yeah I've eaten it at cookery in cookery class

C	no that's that's
B	no it's not faggots
A	brains
B	brawn
C	is it good?
B	yeah it's okay
C	gizzards another lovely one
B	they did they don't have no I haven't had that
C	it's very common in Korea to eat er chickens' bottoms like the the
A	oh
C	it's kind of gross you get the
B	oh not what you mean
C	a whole plate of er rectum
B	oh
A	yeah
C	yeah it's er
A	no I mean no that's
C	you fry it up it's actually okay it's not
B	oh
C	it's not though it's not like sort of something well evil
B	no I don't believe you on that one
A	oh dear oh dear you've seen that's enough of that stuff
C	they love it out there
B	well when the
C	have you ever had chicken's feet?
B	no
C	you eat the feet
B	crispy yes
A	yeah
C	it's it's like
A	they say you are what you eat and if you were a bit of a bit of an arsehole you're
C	sorry
B	oh god
C	we eat any part of the animal right? you eat sausages and I'm sure they've got every part of the animal
B	well they were on Masterchef weren't they and they were cooking sausages and everything
C	oh gosh
B	oh god they
A	oh what like the kangaroo's ones?
B	yeah
C	oh
B	actually on Masterchef and it and he wasn't just like er well it's erm Get me Out of Here I'm a Celebrity sort of thing
C	they're genuinely cooking
A	this was proper cooking yeah they were on the show don't you remember when there was?
A	yes I do yeah
B	plates of this?
A	yeah yeah yeah
C	why?
B	well why we eat everything else so why why distinguish? somebody had to to to eat a trotter didn't they?
C	I mean okay but it
B	somebody had to eat the liver and the kidneys but have you ever had a heart?
C	erm
B	have you had heart?
C	no I don't think I have had heart
B	nobody has I've had heart
A	heart?
B	yeah
A	yeah heart
C	unless I've kind of eaten it and didn't realised it that oh no I've had chicken hearts very small ones
B	no no
A	yeah
B	I've had I've had proper hearts stuffed my mum used to do that for my dad
A	stuffed hearts yeah
B	I think it's a
A	mm
B	er I think it's a bit it's a cross between kidneys livers all that sort of thing trotters
C	offal
A	mm
B	oh that
C	they cut here and had the hog roast like a piece of tongue or the mouth whereas it goes right down to the gullet
A	yeah
C	it was really tasty it was just like a piece of steak
B	well yeah but you have tongue don't you a whole tongue like like ham yeah
A	well a bit like yeah the hog tail
B	yeah
C	oxtail
B	that's lovely yeah
C	there's all sorts of odd things
B	I love oxtail soup
A	yes
C	I mean there is no distinction is there?
B	well that's what I was
C	I mean it's just whatever is whatever
B	it's because we just look at things and think
C	it tasted of wine
B	mm are you
C	I know that's one thing I think I'd be like I mean have they brained them?
A	yeah
C	you know
A	oh oh god
C	sorry to go into detail but
A	you could be eating our own children
C	exactly
A	your so your own brothers and sisters
C	yeah
A	oh god
B	we don't eat human things do you it's
C	no no it's
A	well I don't know
A	well if you watch Hannibal of all
C	I imagine
A	scene with erm do know like Eddie Izzard?
C	yes yes he's in quite a bit suddenly yeah
A	yes where erm he's it's the last supper
C	oh he's eating himself is he?
A	yeah the last supper yes that was interesting
C	yeah
A	cos he had no option really did he?
C	if you don't like some of the other things don't watch if you don't like and Hannibal is a bit
B	no quite a lot of them erm that's why I have my own room with my own television in and I
C	Hannibal is extreme but it's quite tastefully done at the same time
A	it's quite clever yeah
C	but it is extreme
A	which Hannibal have you watched and seen as in erm Anthony Hopkins?
C	yeah
A	playing Hannibal Lecter? the Hannibal you're presented with is the man who's got caught and
C	yes
A	all you're seeing is his ability to manipulate
C	I'm interested to see how the new Hannibal is once he's been caught
A	yes
C	how
A	because the Hannibal you see in in Hannibal is the man who's not been caught
C	charismatic
A	and you're seeing his charisma
C	his culture and education
A	his culture his education to be honest
C	too sane
A	yeah but clearly he's not
C	much too sane
A	yeah it it's
C	it is quite good
A	it is clever yeah
C	I mean it's it's quite enough
A	but it's gory but it's clever
C	have you seen have you seen Rome?
A	sorry?
C	Rome
A	no
C	I think maybe you'd like that certainly the first season of Rome is excellent it's really really good whoever the guy the actor that plays Caesar is fantastic
A	oh
C	absolutely fantastic it's the story of erm Caesar's rise to power after Gaul and the
A	you mean Julius Caesar?
C	yeah and then yeah not Octavia or
A	yeah right
C	erm and then
A	yeah yeah
C	the senate and that kind of stuff
A	yeah
C	it's it's really very well acted it's all British actors and it's it's really quite it's very really well acted
B	no it's not that
C	and a little sexual in places but it's not
B	if it's in
C	there's not much swearing
B	part of the story as and again it's part of it I don't if it's when every other word's a swear word
C	yeah no I
B	or it's just so
C	I agree
B	certain language and certain things and I think just I just don't believe they should be on
A	in
C	I I'm quite
A	in Hannibal there is no swearing is there?
C	not a lot
A	no not
B	well Hannibal is so far fetched it's unbelievable
A	it's it's certainly not
C	Hannibal is very slow
A	yeah
C	it's really slow paced
A	it yeah
C	it's very very slow
A	fifteen minutes of the first one and made her mind up on the strength of that
B	that was enough yeah
C	yeah okay
A	which is is
C	well try Rome I'd recommend it
A	it's not into character developments
C	it it kick started this out the
A	yeah
C	at the same time
A	yeah
C	but it's just much much better acted
A	yeah
C	I was really quite engrossed in the first season I'm watching the second season now and since erm Julius Caesar has died I think it's lost a lot bit that actor was very good
A	yeah yeah
C	er
A	which part did he play?
C	well he's one of the guys on the wall that dies quite early
A	oh right so he's
C	yeah you'd recognise him if you saw him but
A	right yeah
C	but he's such he's such a good Caesar
A	right yeah
C	the character is really good I really really liked him
A	I'm
C	the third
A	the season three
C	yeah
A	it's season three they've got obviously they have to catch him at some time
C	yes well season four is Red Dragon
A	right
C	Manhunter
A	yes
C	season five is Silence of the Lambs season six is Hannibal
A	right
C	season seven is
A	yeah
C	and then it's going to follow more closely it's obviously gonna deviate quite dramatically from erm
A	yeah
C	but erm
A	they said he was when he was with Jodie Foster er Anthony Hopkins right he was caught
C	no the characteristics
A	and I say l like the actor Mads Mikkelsen cos he plays he's so cultured that's the trouble he is immaculate his cooking he's a he's like a Michelin style equivalent
C	what is that dish I've come across it a couple of times with that bird that use the very small bird and then they soak it in er alcohol and they set fire to the it's like a foetus of a bird and and then they eat the thing whole they do it
A	yeah I can't remember what it's called
C	it's kind of famous like
A	yes
C	I it was
A	yes always trying meals from all over the world but
C	yeah right
A	the the thing with him is I
C	his outfits
A	he's immaculately dressed yeah he's he's he never has anything out of place he's
C	but that makes him very suspicious
A	yes he's very meticulous er
C	he is unbelievable yeah he's unbelievable
A	yeah he is too good to be
B	the whole series is just totally
A	he's too
C	yeah I
A	he's too good to be true
C	oh oh and the the most jarring thing for me in that season is especially the first season there's a different serial killer in every
A	they're always home grown aren't they?
C	they just happen to have
A	yeah home grown
C	twenty serial killers or
A	who live in about a two hundred mile radius yeah I mean
C	it's entertaining
A	although
C	it's very grotesque
A	although
C	and the dialogue's good and I like dialogue so
A	they they they reckon that there are point one percent of the population are serial killers which means there are three hundred in the States at any time
C	yeah
C	anyone would be
A	to about thirty million
C	point one I mean if there's three hundred million people
A	yeah
C	one percent would be three million
A	yeah
C	point one percent would be
A	three
C	thirty thousand
A	oh oh is it nought point one? er how many noughts have you got to take off? er nought
C	regardless
A	one hold it one
C	let's just say there's about three hundred
A	yeah there's three hundred
C	it's easier yeah
A	there's about three hundred
C	cos if there's about three hundred million people
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	cos I'm thinking one percent of three hundred million is
C	is three hundred
A	three million
C	so
A	isn't it?
C	point one percent of three million isn't three hundred
A	it's for the no so it's point nought point one percent yeah which they no nought point nought nought one percent
C	yeah yeah
A	yeah
C	we're getting into maths now aren't we?
C	yeah nought point nought nought one percent yeah
A	how's your maths then?
B	diabolical
A	yeah yeah
B	absolutely diabolical
C	mine too
A	yeah it's
C	it's as long I can do quick calculations
unknown_female	have you all finished?

C	watch too many things I don't remember his character's name but I know who you're talking about
A	yeah
C	he frames him doesn't he?
A	yes he frames him and then wants to get him off cos he's basically showing how clever he is
C	and then they're they've been

B	no I would be say
A	I'd probably I I'd call it a Cobra
C	I
B	yeah I say Cobra
A	Cobra yeah yeah maybe
C	I think I think you're
B	it's the same as scone and scone
C	I think you're attributing Spanish maybe even French pronunciation
A	yeah Cobra
C	in Spanish I would say Cobra
A	yeah
C	or Cobra
A	yeah I know
C	but in English I say Cobra
C	Cobra and America would sort of say Cobra
B	Cobra
C	Cobra that would work
A	there's a
A	there's a erm
B	yeah
A	he's
C	it is I've studied phonetics and it is named more names
A	yeah
C	they use more names and they use more words if I say ah and I hold my nose I can still say ah there's no change if they say
A	yes there's a village near Northampton that erm where the wedding where the where the where the erm wedding
B	are they hot?
A	where the church was

B	yeah
C	but it's kind of like
B	no but it's got an e on the end when it's in er like Ilfracombe it's C O M B E
C	B E yeah
B	but they if you're talking about a comb it's C O M B
C	it's M B you're right yeah
B	isn't it so the E makes it say
C	traditionally we added the E to show the the longer vowel which I learnt again when I was
A	there are some nutty things in the English language erm one of them I'll say it in Spanish and see if you can translate you should be able to erm
C	man of the spider spider of
A	yes now
C	but in compounds the head is the second one blackbird isn't a type of black it's a type of bird
A	yeah
C	so the second compound
A	yeah
C	when you stick them together so spider man
A	yeah
C	it's a type of man not a type of spider
A	yeah
C	blackbird is type of bird
A	yeah you would think it would be
C	we put the stress on the second one because that's what it
A	yeah yeah you would think the stress should be on the first and not the second
C	yeah I know what you're saying whereas in Spanish the genitive you'd have to say man of the
A	yeah they'd say
C	spider
A	the man of spider

C	your son your son
C	I'm not saying I will I may not succeed in an MA yet
A	yeah
C	I have
A	yeah
C	as so far
A	you have aspirations
C	as so far for the last ten years everything I've said I'm gonna do I've done so hopefully
A	well I think in
C	if I continue along that route
A	I think in our lineage
B	I think you stand a good chance of doing it because you enjoy it
C	yeah
B	basically
A	well that's you're halfway there erm you're going to be the most erm
C	yeah I mean I come from a time where I can
A	yeah
C	which would and quite a few countries are and in Europe and seen
B	oh yeah
A	I've been to Taiwan I've been to Korea
C	but including layers that
A	but I haven't you know been as far as you have you know I haven't been as many places in your lifespan
C	I counted the other day I've been to forty-one countries
A	yeah
C	it's quite a few
A	yeah
C	for twenty-eight rather it's quite a few
A	do we count Wales and Spain er like Wales and Scotland?
C	I count I haven't been to Scotland I counted Wales I've only been to Cardiff but
A	oh right
C	but I counted it
A	it that that
C	like forty-one
A	yeah so that's two er do do you count England in that at all or not?
C	yes
A	yeah so that's three erm that's erm er
C	is Tenerife a country?
A	yeah they're different islands aren't they?
C	are they countries though?
A	no they're different islands though they're islands
C	aren't they owned by Spain though?
A	yeah but they're like they're about eight hundred
C	oh not sure that that counts as a country
A	they're eight hundred miles away
C	oh I'm not sure if it counts as a country though dad
A	er
A	Taiwan
C	it's debatable what a country is
B	Fuerteventura
C	adds four
A	that's four
B	Canaria
A	Gran Canaria
B	no it's not Canaria
A	Canaria Canaria
B	it it's with I A
A	alright A Canaria okay that's four because there are four different islands that are separated by quite a bit of water
C	but then I could argue you know I went to the Andaman Islands I went to Little Andaman I went to Button Island I went to Neil Island
A	oh
C	I went to Ross Island I went to
A	yeah I know but they're not
B	yeah bet they all are they all all what do they come under the category of?
C	well they're all part of India but they're a thousand miles away from India and they're they're
A	yeah yeah
C	you know
B	yes but are they called so and so like the Channel Islands or the something islands?
C	the Andaman Islands
B	the Andaman Islands yes that's the
C	the Andaman and Nicobar Islands but I've only been to the Andaman Islands
A	right so okay so
C	but but they're owned by India so I just count India I don't say I've been to India and and you know the Andaman
B	oh right
A	okay so if I count all those four as one alright I'll
B	no let's really not do that
A	there was Scotland England
B	but then you could say that about the British Isles it's just one country because there's no you need water between them
B	yeah
A	no it's effectively three countries that's the United Kingdom
C	it's it's one country and four countries actually
A	right well oh we'll go
C	the United Kingdom
A	oh we've got three there then we've got France
B	alright
A	then I've got Germany then I've got Belgium then I've got erm Spain man mainland the Canary Islands Minorca
C	still Spain
A	you can say I've got yes but but there's
C	it's still Spain
C	yeah but the Andaman Islands were a five day boat journey from from
A	that narrows it that look I lose all the Minorcan Islands and all the
C	it's still Spain
A	sorry all if I lose all the Iberian Islands
C	I mean I could say in Greece I went to Folegandros and Sifnos and Santorini and
A	yeah
A	well that that that
C	but that's Greece it's just like Greece
A	in that case so er right Spain
B	it is going down further and further
A	Wales Scotland England France
C	I'll give you those they are countries
A	Belgium
C	I mean it's debatable what's a country you know
A	Spain that really knocks a lot out then Taiwan
B	I've been more than you then if you look all like that
A	no I've been to twelve
B	so?
C	I mean twelve's pretty good
B	Luxembourg Belgium France Holland Switzerland erm Italy England Scotland Wales oh where's that?
unknown_female	you wanna leave it in the middle?
B	thank you
C	oh that's fantastic thank you very much
unknown_female	thanks
A	that's not twelve
B	pardon? well I didn't want you going up then did I? I haven't finished yet
A	well you've got you can't yeah Spain
B	that that and then I've got the Canary Islands
A	no no I
C	well we said that's one
B	no yeah just one
A	that's one
B	I haven't counted them I just said the Canary Islands
A	yeah
B	France Spain
A	no that comes under Spain
B	Italy
A	apparently according to
C	well it does I mean it's in the same country
A	yeah yeah so yeah so
B	oh alright then
B	so I'm not far behind considering how
A	no you're not far behind
B	yeah
C	it's pretty good
A	distance wise you are because like take
B	oh yes
A	that way going back up into
B	well I knew you'd have to be one better
A	and up into erm
C	got to get pedantic about it
A	did I put Mexico in there?
C	you said Mexico yeah you did say
A	right yeah you the furthest west I've been in
C	out of the countries you said I haven't been on Luxembourg and I haven't been to Canada but otherwise I've been on those
A	yes Mexico
C	I've been to Mexico I spent six weeks in Mexico
A	of course you did you did most of the
A	yeah yeah so you've done
C	Belize Honduras Nicaragua
A	yes yeah you've been to many
C	forty-one in all fairness I haven't met
A	no no
C	which is quite a statement because I've met quite a few people on our travels
A	yes
B	mm
C	I haven't met anyone that's kind of been
A	yeah it's a
B	and you seen the cultures that you like that you've seen
A	I I can't I can't
C	if you can imagine if we keep going because
A	yes
C	I mean potentially in two years we're gonna go to Africa
A	yeah
C	and when we go to Africa we're probably gonna do another ten countries over a year I would imagine
A	yeah the one that's really well travelled
C	what's it gonna be like when we're forty?
A	is the queen she has been to a hell of a lot of countries erm
C	I'm not sure if she's roughed quite as well as the
A	no not at all
A	erm so
B	I don't think somehow she'd be on the beach you know
A	if you go down both
C	getting mugged
A	if you go down both both your parents' lineage I can't see any of your er our ancestors who have been to so many countries there's no way how would they
C	so there you go and regardless of getting married or having children I've made my mark I have two superlatives in the
A	yes
C	most countries
A	yes well you're the most educated now
C	that's
B	you're the only one with a degree
C	is there nobody in our family that's got a degree? nobody?
A	no
A	no er I my my
C	there's no in
A	my
C	is this gonna be nice?
B	go on have a go go and taste it
A	no I have A level equivalents
C	it's dad's birthday he should really first
A	er er
C	oh it is quite firm isn't it? how sweetened?
A	it's quite sweet but it's nice it cuts through
C	is this what you?
A	yeah
B	mm
C	is there like something on the bottom?
B	yeah
C	it's good
A	it's quite still quite hard
C	hold it steady
A	yeah they do go with a spicy meal cuts it cleans the palate
C	there's a dessert in India that I used to hate
B	you used to hate?
C	yeah I absolutely hated it it it came it's not really a dessert it came it's like a I don't know a digestif of some sort it's not a drink but at the end of every meal they bring it out in a plant of some sort it's very aniseedy I'm not I don't know if it was aniseed but it's like seeds and it just tastes like aniseed and you eat it with sugar so you get like a handful of sugar and a handful of these seeds and everyone eats it after every meal a square pretty much the entire country over everyone I've never seen it anywhere outside of India it was horrible I really didn't like it quite often there'd be ants in the sugar
B	oh
C	and they'd put some sugar on your hand and you've got like ants in there and stuff and you've got to blow the ants out but you know when you get sick and the last thing you ate have you ever had this experience?
A	yeah
C	and you just go off it like you really just
A	what caused you to be sick?
B	yeah
C	I remember I got I mean obviously I was ill quite a few times in India and and one of the times I associated it with this and after that and the problem is it was rude to turn it down they'd often just put it in your hand afterwards and you'd be like oh I really don't want
C	yeah I dropped it they'd just give you more I think
B	well you
A	do you not like aniseed?
C	I don't mind aniseed I don't have a problem with aniseed but
A	no er or the only reason I'm saying that was
C	oh
C	so maybe that's why then
A	yes
C	it's possible I've gone off a few things though because of being sick I tell you one of the worst experiences I've ever had was being sick on a camel safari in the desert in India and they camped us downwind from these terribly flatulent camels it was horrible I was so ill and like everything tasted bad my own
A	yes yes
C	I just I remember thinking at that point I wanna be at home in my bed just like lying in the desert
C	yeah I know yeah
A	because we've been on there without the
C	we have been on yeah
A	yeah
C	I'm not sure if that was quite a safari but
A	no but
B	it was er no across the dunes wasn't it?
A	it was on camels it was on camels and it was in the dunes yeah yes cos we saw that didn't we? we went the camel place we never went on a camel
B	we did what was it called?
A	erm it was on Gran Canaria I can't remember what it was called
B	and that
A	but there was lots of big lizards there weren't there?
B	yeah lots of
C	yeah
B	mm
C	if you actually have to sit on one for hours it was horrible I had a really old one for
C	a really old and bony one er
A	I think it's just Arab habits because er the health and safety's out the window
C	with him standing on the elephant
A	and
C	oh you couldn't do a lot of things we've done
A	yeah
C	in this country it was this is
B	well what about that one the picture we've got of you sitting in the erm in
A	the tigers
B	with the tigers that weren't tigers
B	has he?
C	yes he went to the same place
B	did he?
C	yeah so he has a similar photo you'll have to see it it's up there
B	yeah it's
A	yeah he showed me the erm
C	yeah that was a erm an unchained tiger was and some people had been scratched only a few people before me had a big like gash down his arm and it was like oh okay
A	is that like in its sleep when it's?
C	yeah I I've been in a few instances that I've definitely thought I could perhaps die this is not good I actually had one experience where I really thought I was going to die I genuinely thought I was going to die have you ever heard of a banded sea krait? it's a type of snake
A	it's a snake
C	yeah a banded sea krait
A	that that's a very
C	very very very poisonous snake it's
A	yeah
C	it's like the most poisonous snake in the world I've seen them three times first time they swam around my feet in the Andaman Isles most remote the remotest place I've ever been swam around my feet didn't quite know what it was at the time second time I was scuba diving and it was curled up just like beautiful snake really really beautiful third time it swam to the surface took a breath and then went back down under the water really again very beautiful I've been told and I always heard David Attenborough's voice in my head you know the voice of god that if you get bitten by this snake you'll die within about
A	not long at all
C	ten seconds to a minute
A	yeah
C	it's got such a powerful neurotoxin but because its prey can swim away fast
A	yeah so it needs
C	so it needs something that
B	stuns it yeah
A	that kills it quick yeah
C	you know can
A	yeah yeah yeah
C	I was scuba
A	no
C	if I have somebody else with me I am infinitely more confident
A	yeah
C	than when I'm on my own and it was very murky and I felt like suddenly I got hit numerous times by something and I kind of panicked and swam in and I come out and I saw two teeth mark here right on my hand where it knew that it could be bitten no joke and I stood there my heart was racing
A	yeah
C	and I said to
A	was there any blood?
C	sweating there was a little bit there were two pin pricks like
A	yeah
C	I mean it looked perfectly like two teeth
A	yeah yeah
C	but in hindsight when it happened I actually pulled something out of it and I think what happened was when I felt like I got hit by a few things I think I got hit by a shoal of fish and I think you know fish have spines on their back?
A	yeah
C	I think two of the spines were in my hand but it was just conveniently exactly like two fangs
A	yeah
C	and I I tell you what I just
A	you want to suck the poison out
C	and I was kind of going this is it
A	yeah
C	I'm I've gone
A	yeah
C	and I was thinking to myself at least if I die now I'll die happy to a certain degree
A	yeah
C	but this could be it
C	I really thought I really thought that was it it took a good it took half an hour
A	yeah
C	cos in your head you're going okay maybe maybe a minute's an exaggeration maybe it'll be five minutes
A	yeah
C	maybe it'll be ten minutes
A	yeah
C	ten minutes passes oh maybe half an hour and it's
C	it was horrible absolutely horrible
A	how many days had passed before you said I think I'm in the clear?
C	yeah
C	I told you I mean
A	yeah
C	but these islands are a thousand miles off the coast of India they're south of Myanmar which doesn't exactly have many tourists anyway
A	no
C	erm they still have cannibals they used to be called the cannibal isles there are tribes on these islands that we've never had any contact with you know those videos where you see a helicopter flying over and they're throwing the spears and stuff? that's there that's on the Andaman Islands we were swimming on these this most beautiful beach I've ever been on and the it wasn't until a few months later that we actually read an article somebody on that beach got eaten by a salt water crocodile three months after we were there
A	yeah
C	and everyone was saying you know why haven't they put signs up? like you need to be and other people were saying this is one of the most remote places in the world like
A	yeah
C	how can you put a sign up?
A	yeah
C	when there's no one there
A	yeah
C	I actually got stung there by erm have you ever heard of fire coral? it's a type of coral that lays a living creature in you effectively and if you scratch it it spreads
B	mm
C	I didn't know what it was at the time and it I woke up with my arm on fire after I'd been scuba diving in this area it lasted for about two or three weeks it was like thousands of of mosquito bites like
A	yeah
C	all over my arms it was horrible absolutely horrible it's only in hindsight that I realised how kind of dangerous that area was
A	yeah
C	that we were in
A	yeah
C	and like I looked at a map of where salt water crocodiles are and it was there this is one of their most prolific areas and like they grow up the biggest salt water crocodile ever
A	yeah they're big
C	well two metres
A	yeah
C	can you imagine a a crocodile that's three and a half times the size of dad?
B	well we were watching erm on the
A	erm
C	and that was crocodiles and this one it was
A	it was about erm it was erm about erm a thousand pounds in weight is what the biggest crocodile
C	I imagine these were quite similar
B	absolutely massive
C	it seems er ridiculous but they exist
B	yeah
A	oh yeah
C	real salt water crocodile exists they're all off the I was crawling around on my belly in the mudflats and mangroves of Calcutta and around the area of the Sundarbans which I only found out in hindsight is notorious for massive salt water crocodiles
A	yeah
C	and there's I went on a tour you know I mean I call it a tour but it's very low key wishy washy and we they took us into the mangroves and they're like yeah you can just slide around on the mud and stuff we were told there were crocodiles there but we didn't know the extent
A	I did think when erm
C	oh yeah I heard about that
A	they got killed in Thailand
C	yeah
C	Koh Tao
A	yeah Koh Tao
C	it was on the island
A	yeah Koh Tao and it was like erm
B	thank you very much
A	I think there's since about two thousand and nine there's been about eleven couple er eleven people English people killed er
C	just English I mean in India I was in a place called Jodhpur
A	Jodhpur is that where they do the trousers?
C	yeah yeah well we
B	yeah
A	yeah yeah
C	a month after I left there was a stampede at a temple I was at killed three hundred men a piece of wall fell over and it caused a stampede three hundred men died in the crush it was a month after I was there
B	well you know have you heard on the news just recently about that couple on the island that er got murdered?
A	yeah I just said yeah
C	yeah I was just saying yeah yeah it was in Thailand
B	oh right sorry I was watching yeah and that's where
C	I've been there I spent quite a while on Koh Tao
A	so
C	I've been in a couple of places where massive volcanoes have erupted like
A	like
C	that was only a few days prior
A	yeah
C	yeah and I flew almost exactly the same route
B	and then we were waiting
C	yeah
B	he said oh shall we go where
C	couple of days couple of days later the same same journey
B	yeah
C	same flight goes off
A	mm
C	there's been a few instances I mean you only have to come close to England
A	yeah
C	I was going to see a gig with
A	right
C	so we got to the train station as just as it had been bombed and they wouldn't let us on the train
A	no
C	er we sat in a pub and watched the whole thing unfold but we were we'd organised to be on the seven o'clock train or the seven thirty train to go to London and we should have been on in
A	yeah
C	there's a a few instances now where you think whoa
A	yes
C	a month earlier or a few hours earlier that would have
A	mm I think it fate dictates when you when when it's your time it's your time and that's it
C	it's your time yeah
A	and that's it yeah you have these nine lives
C	yeah but
A	no she no she's
C	she's not terrible but
A	she's flown a lot
C	she's erm
B	but don't you think sometimes?
A	but she used to
C	yeah it's statistics
A	where she's looking at yeah yeah
C	cos you start thinking well I've been on this a few times now
A	yeah yeah
B	yeah that's the trouble though you've been haven't you and the more you've been you've been the more you tend to realise just what you've putting yourself in for but then you have to weight that up in for the same reason driving on a bus or walking down the street
C	absolutely
B	the chances of that are higher of that than on a plane so
C	I mean in Nepal we were only about twelve cars behind a humungous avalanche that I mean people must have died in it because there was a village there and I couldn't see a village er the whole side of the mountain collapsed and the road had collapsed and we had to wait for about three or four hours while diggers undug the road but our bus was only about twelve vehicles behind the the collapse so I mean
B	yes
C	I was about twelve vehicles away from a landslide I don't know how many how much time that was I mean it could have been one vehicle every five minutes it could have been a vehicle every couple of minutes it could have been half an hour or it could have been five minutes but all I know is you walk up to it and you look at it and go
B	I think it makes it must make you feel I should say really lucky
C	yeah
B	in that some people suffer so much and see so much in in their lives
C	yeah I feel very privileged I do feel very privileged
B	yeah
C	it also helps me to feel connected I think with these people as well to have been and seen and to talked to them and to be there and to just realise that there are big differences between us but there are much more similarities between us between cultures but
B	but you will have enjoyed it
C	yeah know that I died happy
B	well it's like my dad you know my mum is is I think part of it is because when you've lived with somebody or had a partner for such a long long time you just rely on them to be there I mean the thought of one one losing the other and one of them being left is something but my mum tends to get sort of like over protective and my dad keeps turning around and saying well he would much rather die doing something that he loves than sitting around or laying in a hospital bed
C	yeah
B	so you know it like his skiing he'd love to ski again he knows he can't do anything like he used to because he'd go down a black run erm and what have you but and it's like
C	and skiing's really dangerous
B	yeah it can be yeah
C	it's not that safe yeah
B	erm
C	is he still doing it?
B	oh he still does it
C	oh wow
B	yeah and it's only like
C	that's phenomenal
B	if a lorry go down the side is the horse
C	I mean you take it away for that person then the living doesn't look an absolute joy anymore and what's the point?
B	no that's precisely it and that's how it should be the end of your life you've worked so hard and you've done all these things but he's still working now so I mean he's still
A	he's still going yeah and he he's supposed to be retired but he's not
B	he he's beginning to they're you know and like
A	yeah and you can see it
C	what's he working? I mean at eighty-three most people aren't working
B	I know
A	most people are dead
C	well
B	but to me that's him he's always been that way he can't sit for very long he does a bit more now because he's been busy with the work and he's retired and what have you
C	I mean it's it's being active that keeps some people going isn't it yeah?
B	well that's what it is it's true yeah they say once you stop doing something you get off and you won't restart it
C	I can imagine that
A	yeah he's very he's very
B	oh god
A	yes
B	he really is
A	but er but if you
B	you're not allowed to smoke in here are you?
C	I was gonna er
A	yeah
B	oh right you've prepared it
C	would would you mind?
B	no I don't go on
A	compared with your dad even though he's improved he's still er are not in the same league as
B	as
A	no he doesn't
B	yeah but then er in all fairness give him his due my dad has
A	he hadn't been for sixty years
B	oh well and my mum made him go because he had a cyst
A	a
B	didn't he?
A	a sebaceous cyst
B	a sebaceous cyst
C	yeah and on my head too
A	yeah
B	on the top of his ear
C	like this
B	yeah we've had this discussion before
A	your mum's got
C	the whole family's got one here it's like a divorce bump
A	yes your mum's got one yes yes
C	or something I don't know what it is
A	er I don't know if your mum's
C	do you know what I mean? even if you're like
A	your mum's had hers treated or not your mum had one before me and it was on her head in the same place
C	it's weird it's like some flesh coloured mole or something
A	yeah I had mine lanced
B	lanced?
A	yes lanced that's what I was saying lanced
B	oh sorry I thought you said lanched
A	no lanced
C	lanched lanched
B	lanced yeah
A	I had it lanced by well so that was the first time he's been for one
B	yeah why they they hadn't got any any records of him though and but at the doctors
C	that's fantastic
A	he hadn't been for about sixty years
B	he's been so lucky
C	that's pretty healthy
B	but
B	he didn't had anything he never had anything and all of a sudden wham
C	you've just gotta I mean
B	yeah that's right or you have to get something out of life
C	yeah and it's it is different for different people I mean for a long time I struggled with the idea you know I enjoy this so much how can you not? and I guess as I've gotten older I realised that you know not everyone is the same so what I may find pleasurable other people don't find pleasurable
A	no
C	is that alright? shall I stop this or will you guys continue talking?
B	yeah you stop it
A	no we won't talk to each other when you're gone will we?
B	we don't talk
C	you don't talk? I'm gonna leave it on and I'll listen when I go home and see what you say
A	you're gonna be disappointed
B	I feel like
A	er however much er
C	if I just do it
A	yeah
B	he told me had
A	pressure pressure
B	I'm surprised he he was saying that erm he was anxious you know he he they went through a
A	mm what after he's done everything he's done?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	you know he's so you know
A	I think it
B	oh yes it is
A	and he said yeah I think so because I think I've gone through something similar going back to uni now that my I would say like your stomach and stuff like that you may think that consciously that there's no problem but subconsciously you might your body is going er these are changes er and I'm responding to those changes in the way that you know
B	has have you er have you spoken to
A	no he hasn't yeah I did feel a bit
B	did he say whether he's going to the doctors and how his stomach was?
A	no no
B	well he obviously he does feel a bit better
A	mm
B	well you are part have yourself
A	you don't have to give me a present er that was kind of like yeah that's fine but the the thought might have been nice
B	but you see well
A	there you go
B	I think you have you do partly have that to blame because he did ask you what you would like and say well what can we get you? and was going don't worry son just don't don't do it like this
A	yeah so don't go over yeah
B	sort of thing and I suppose he just thinks oh well you you obviously don't probably see he takes it the wrong way
A	well no I said I said you know you to money you can't afford it so don't do it you know
B	well yeah I know but I'm saying perhaps because it's
A	no they write the rules
B	yeah so but I mean as I say
A	yeah or phoned before or a phone call
B	and just rung up you see
A	well
B	I think that's what men are more like this and then you get older it depends on how well whether you appreciate it or not doesn't it?
B	yeah
A	right I hope we've got er that
B	I think I heard
A	yeah has he gone away has he gone away for?
B	well I don't know all he said to me was when he looked over the wall one day he said something about erm I'm working away now I have to work so it's easier or something now I have to work away
A	if it was just erm
A	you would hope in a few years' time they're not gonna be having parties where you know them like what the opposite the the bungalow opposite you know like there were male young lads there and they were like
B	oh yeah
A	and
A	that kind of arrangement
B	because I get I tried to work out when you said to me how old she is she was
A	yeah
B	I can't remember how no she's gotta be older than that because she was about sort of she must have been at least
A	no no not she's not she
B	so she's gotta be fifteen or sixteen cos I'm sure when
C	they've had a party
B	they've had a party yeah
C	yeah they've had those before I think yeah
B	they're not as loud as they were last time and they don't they're touch wood don't speak too soon they haven't had the drums have they?
A	no
B	mm and they just
C	what just it's Friday tonight
B	yeah that's what I said
A	last time it was two Fridays and then the last the third one was a Saturday
B	was it?
A	yes
B	was the last week Saturday?
A	yeah they erm
C	can you hear it in every room?
A	you can't hear it in the front
B	you can hear it well you
A	no you can't hear it in front
A	I've never can't hear it in the front room because it's right on the other side the house
B	oh the and the
A	there's no connection to that side
C	which one's the front bedroom?
B	the one you used the one before
A	where you slept before
C	okay
A	erm
B	but your dad went last last weekend into your room where you are because you can't hear it in there so well
A	you don't hear it initially but they get louder as the
C	what time do they normally finish?
B	quarter to two
C	oh gosh that's quite late
A	yeah
B	it is
A	so er
C	yeah
A	yeah that
C	well drums are loud drums are extremely loud
A	think of a full sized one and now in the garage find that at three o'clock in the morning and no one can hear
C	any people complaining?
A	oh er I complained I complained I knocked on the door and unfortunately he
C	refrain from playing the drums
A	take it well I didn't mention the drums I said well though take no it's alright you know to stay out in the pond in the pool till midnight and then go in
C	and that's respectable
A	but no they were coming out at midnight to go in the pond and like they're all screaming
C	trouble is the more you drink the less you care
A	yeah yes exactly so now what they've done is A they haven't told us and B they're going out
C	so not being where very respectful of their neighbours
A	not at all no so so no
B	and then the they're not and it's like
C	but has no one else complained?
B	no I don't think
A	well not that we know of
B	well I don't see the other the thing thing is our bedroom is out the back
A	but we're never away
B	and we have a vent er a vent in the wall erm and it it just sort of permeates through it's just so loud but the thing is we've shut the ventilators down because it's got a bit colder and there's quite a breeze in but you don't such a light sleeper if you can't settle for me I just sleep through them I just
A	see some people it doesn't bother
C	have you tried ear plugs?
A	I got pieces of paper in my ears and I can still hear it
C	do you know what's really good and what I use travelling because I'm not gonna lie some of the places I've slept in are horrific? I've actually
B	yeah
C	and I sleep with one ear on the pillow and one in I can't put them both in because it's uncomfortable
A	yeah
C	if you sleep with one ear on the pillow and one ear in it helps a lot a lot I would recommend getting some because they're my godsend now and there's numerous
B	far away
C	erm
A	you might need that tonight er it depends on what's going on
C	I've got my headphones with me so
B	it won't be it won't be
C	hopefully not paper doesn't work
A	no
C	that's no good
A	no it
C	these inner earplugs are good I'd recommend you investigate it
A	er that was the girl on the line to me I gave you you know I was I I asked two simple things one erm tell me when you're gonna do it
C	you weren't saying don't do it you were just saying be respectful
A	yeah and can you erm do it the other way round rather than take cos her answer was oh well we're too old for that now
B	yeah
C	too old for what?
A	to to do the erm
B	to be out late at night in
A	out like doing the things
C	right so who was doing that then? were they all just?
A	I think she's she's definitely party to it yeah
C	going for it as well yeah
A	so my my my line would be erm I I I asked two simple things from you one let us know if you're doing this so we can be aware of it two erm take it er you know inside after midnight not the other way round
C	have you not called not the police but there's like noise police there's like?
A	oh you
C	you've been disrespectful
A	yeah yeah
B	no well when when erm
C	yeah
B	and what have you and we burn some wood and it's not always smokeless coal so I wouldn't do that but if you're gonna light a bonfire in a garden he won't come round to see if I've got any washing and peep over the fence and that so I get you're running to get the washing in the other week it
A	he he was he was trying to burn fresh wood and like
B	the smoke you couldn't see the garden it was that smoky and that so you know if you
C	yeah if you've asked
B	I was gonna say yeah
C	I'll bring my washing in and
B	well
B	well I'm not saying he would just do it
A	see my tactic
A	my my tact will well when that
C	yeah definitely do it
A	erm yeah erm
B	well I'm sorry but I don't think that would work because the other morning when they did the little boy was screaming outside and it was about quarter to seven
A	yeah they don't seem to sleep that's like they're like robots and they don't have much sleep
C	it's not on is it?
A	no
C	don't get me wrong it's not all the time and this is why it was you know he was saying this time it's not ever so late it's not ever so loud and I just don't wanna get
C	and you don't know how they're gonna react
B	and if the worst comes to the worst your dad can move bedroom I could get
A	cos I I just go round and say I'm sorry erm if you said you were too old erm have you got younger since then cos you were too old
C	yeah
A	what's happening here? I asked you I gave you I asked for I asked two simple things I ask one tell me
B	yes you're repeating yourself yeah
A	two and was this beyond your
C	I've never understood I've got friends it was difficult in Korea because
A	yeah
C	I used to I used to stay up until the sun came up you know?
A	yeah yeah
C	there was no problem so now
A	or eleven yeah
C	I'm like I'm already quite tired by that point but like
A	yes exactly
C	am I going to have a couple of drinks that that's it?
B	they're going out to the pubs here at nine o'clock at night to get their
A	they're loading up with like a few erm erm well cases and stuff like that at home before they've even gone out they're quite they're sozzled before they go
C	it's some idea that if you're not up until the early hours you're not having a good time
A	yeah
C	well just move it forward so instead of starting at nine start at six and then finish at midnight rather than at three
A	yeah they're not going out till about ten or eleven
C	no er it makes
A	yeah yeah
C	but we we are totally like just
B	no
C	I'm the same
B	well you've got good active lives haven't you and other things on and you your body pattern changes and you can't get it up so then it mucks the next day up and the next day's even worse
C	yeah yeah yeah that's exactly it
B	you know
C	and you've gotta sort food for the week and all the kind of chores and everything and I mean regardless of what time we go to bed
B	well yeah because you won't know where she's going
C	I don't know where you've gone or
B	yeah
A	yes yes she should tell you
B	yeah
C	yeah and also you're cutting my evening short because I'm worried about you
A	yeah
C	I don't know where you are or what's going on
A	yeah
C	she doesn't do it so much anymore but she she goes through a point where she goes I'm drunk I need to go to bed and she doesn't say anything to anyone else I will I'll have a word with her about it
B	yeah
C	but erm
B	especially if you've got to go walk any distance on your own
C	thankfully we didn't usually have to but
B	well that's right yeah
C	you carry on
B	shall I call for the man for the bill?
A	it's just being consulted isn't it really?
C	do you tip in an establishment like this?
B	cos I didn't know I didn't look on the menu to see whether if there's ten percent
C	I don't know how it works in England
B	it depends generally speaking they always make it look they will say ten percent charge on it erm and then it's up to you but otherwise it's ten percent of the bill
C	and if there's no ten percent you add a tip?
B	yeah
C	I'll have a look at the bill
A	if this was Korea you wouldn't tip would you?
C	no no not at all
A	no they'd be
C	yeah you don't tip in Korea

A	right
C	she sous chefs
A	right okay
C	she still goes through the process with me I'm just kind of in control of the whole thing
A	yeah
C	and I do wash up because there's quite often she's not actually there when I cook and I have to wash up as I'm going along
A	yeah of course
C	and do all that sort of stuff
A	is she like watching the telly or something?
C	what when she's cook when she's washing up?

C	so he nitpicks?
A	no it's like yeah
A	still dirty put it back
B	like this
C	what's that? put it back do it again
A	there's still this bit missed a bit
B	and it's probably you know you
A	was it yesterday or the day before? I sent a pot
C	I do
B	I was doing it on purpose
C	I do it to
A	yeah and it's still dirty
B	yeah but the thing is
A	she doesn't thank me that I'm the last line of defence you know what I mean or she's going oh I feel sick
B	oh no stop it
A	right well thank me for like
B	so you make me sound so have you ever had a dirty plate? no because if I get it out of the cupboard or the washer dishwasher
A	you know oh
C	and it's dirty you put it back
B	and it's dirty I wouldn't use it
A	I'd say oh that must have slipped through and past my so
A	it's quality assurance
A	yes
C	as your washing up
A	yeah I said
C	you'd be eating crap
B	but you wouldn't you'd send it back but I wouldn't
A	exactly that's what I'm doing I'm sending it back

A	but the look oh my and the and the comment afterwards it's like oh
B	I tell you something
A	it's like saying look
B	if it wasn't for the sake of my of my saucepans I'd hit him over the head with it
C	yeah
B	I tell you I get so cross
A	I'm saying
C	you'd break them on that head
A	I'm saying to her look don't thank me for pointing this out but she's taking it all the wrong way
C	yeah
B	no I don't deal with money only spend it
C	yeah
C	I plan everything I do all the emails and all the
A	actually no she's quite frugal yes
C	she's quite frugal?
A	yeah she's quite good yeah
B	yeah
A	yes
C	I can't imagine being in a relationship with somebody that just spends money all the time you know?
A	if you if you've got yeah it's it's better to have two people on the hand break on the roller coaster than none of you and the damn thing's going
C	yeah
A	like like billyo
C	his analogies and
B	oh yes the analogies
C	now I know where I can them from
A	yes
B	but the trouble is he's he's quite frugal on the way you know which is fair dos I tend to but the trouble is
C	oh why not the last bit?
B	no we don't use the last bit on the roll we don't use the last piece of toilet paper
C	why?
B	cos he just doesn't he won't
A	the dishcloth it's like oh it's a dishcloth it harbours so many germs and it's oh my god
C	yeah
B	so he cleans his glasses on three pieces of kitchen roll and then just drops them in the bin and it's such a waste
C	a first world problem
B	well
A	I don't actually dry those ones a lot it's just water
C	why don't you use the last bit of the toilet roll?
B	cos he doesn't
A	cos it's like stuck to the it's like unclean it's stuck to it
C	oh
A	it's stuck to it it's like you pull it off and there's nothing left of it
C	it just rips apart
B	no it doesn't that's a load of rubbish for goodness sake
C	I've been used to cheap toilet roll for a while now
B	well so do we we only pay ninety-nine P from Iceland
C	yeah
B	for four so
C	you don't wanna go too cheap with toilet roll though do you? it's just
A	no there's there's three grades there's thin
B	go on then
A	thinner and oh
C	yeah
B	awful
C	greaseproof paper that's like?
B	yeah
A	oh yeah
B	cor you felt as it was cutting as you
C	oh gosh it's horrible
B	mm and you'd be desperate
C	at school
B	and you'd be hanging on and you'd just be dash when you got off the bus
B	fortunately our bus stopped
C	it hurt
B	it did hurt
C	why would you why would you do that?
B	yes
C	encourage children not to go at school
B	even I'd rather have used newspaper

A	friendships you do have to keep spinning those plates
C	yeah he's not very good at that
A	he thinks I'm seeing
C	I'm being a bit stubborn at the minute I've
A	yeah
C	I've spent too much time trying to instigate it
A	yes
C	and he's not reciprocating
A	no it has to be
C	and so right now I'm like
A	it has to be two way traffic
C	I'm a little bit too busy to care at the minute so
A	yeah yeah no it has to be two way traffic
C	erm I'm sure he'll get in contact with me at some point
