A	yes my love?
B	tell me about your panic attacks then
A	oh it's really weird though
B	so when was the first one again? When you were at that party with your friend
A	the work's do
B	and you felt like you were in a shadow and you didn't want to say anything
A	yeah
B	but then did it subside?
A	well yeah
B	yeah
A	but I really wanted to leave
B	yeah
A	um
B	did you feel sick?
A	I just felt yeah I couldn't catch my breath
B	yeah
A	and just sat on the toilet for a while
B	sort of composing yourself?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	um
B	you have taken a new job in your
A	yeah but it doesn't really count cos it's not
B	yeah it does
A	yeah yeah
B	it's a new
A	yeah
B	it's a new new thing
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	I suppose the thing is like you get to
B	wait
B	right
A	and in my head when I was twenty-one I thought by the time I'm thirty I will have at least have a man if not be married
B	yeah
A	and with a potential for children at some time in my thirties
B	yeah
A	could I be a single mum? Because you've got  you've got  entertain the notion that you're just not datable
B	that's just like putting pressure on yourself
A	I think because there's no it's almost like because there's no limit to the possibilities
B	mm
A	it's really difficult to then think okay then what do I want to do
B	mm
A	like I don't know whether I should move here or there
B	yeah
A	and at least it means that I'll be working towards something so
B	I wonder if it's anything to do with the fact that um
A	we have each other
B	and
A	yeah
B	erm
A	which is fine
B	mm
A	single for four years is quite a long time
B	yeah but you've had blokes in that time though
A	but
B	it just hasn't been the right one
A	I mean I was only half joking when I said you lose a part of your soul each time
B	oh right
A	Cos people do like
B	filling up with fluid and
A	yeah
B	oh no
A	there's water in it really
B	Don't do that
B	Don't get it syringed
B	not towards your ear
A	well it's because I was getting what I thought was my wisdom teeth coming through
B	shit man
A	um
B	maybe you'll be wise when they come through
B	wiser
A	well you'd think something
B	no
A	that'd be quite nice
B	but has the pressures come from anywhere else? Or are they all completely self
A	I think they're self-imposed
B	right
A	own a house
B	and have a career and own a house
A	mm
B	but if you go into different cultures
A	yeah
B	no one
A	this is what I keep telling myself
B	I didn't know a single person in the embassy that owned their own house
A	mm
B	not a single one of them
A	it's a different culture
B	it's just a completely different culture
A	mm
B	um
A	we're in that we're in the shit generation
B	yeah
A	I mean our parents had it quite good
B	yeah
A	Cos they were the baby boomers
B	yeah
A	mortgages were more readily available
B	mm
A	but the generation before that
B	yeah
A	so I think it's just gonna be that our kids will have a good generation
B	reciprocal
A	unless we fuck up the world
B	I'm not having any
A	yeah
B	I'll be their aunty
A	yeah
B	maybe I don't know maybe your like biological clock's kicked in or something
A	something's going on
B	yeah
A	I think well what I need is a plan
B	okay
A	and I feel very listless
B	yeah
A	I was a bit like right okay so now what?
B	because that's what
A	within a matter of moments
B	yeah
A	and you if you lose that
B	and then you got it and you were like bang
A	and and now what?
B	now what?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	and if you just spend your life working towards something
B	yeah
A	there's never really an option not to
B	yeah
A	I mean they say there's not but there isn't
B	yeah
A	so that's what you spend your life working towards
B	yeah
A	sort of bum around for a while
B	yeah
A	and that follows through
B	yeah
A	well now so now what?
B	mm mm
A	and now I've I've got a job that I really enjoy
B	yeah
A	I know it's like I'm quite lucky to enjoy my job
B	yeah
A	but at the same time it is a job I could do anywhere for any publishing house in any business stream
B	mm
A	it's not specific to ELT so again I'm quite fortunate in that regard
B	yeah yeah
A	so that's that's the problem
B	mm
A	so I would have to move there
B	what? What is it that makes you think that you wanna move abroad? Change?
A	it's just yeah just a  just a  new challenge
B	okay
A	which is just unrealistic
B	yeah
A	I'd like to visit every country at least once
B	mm okay
A	and I'm thirty now and I've not really seen that much
B	okay
A	I've seen some
B	mm mm
A	Cos there's no point staying at home to save for a mortgage cos I'd never be able to scrape together the deposit
B	no
A	even though they're saying on er Rightmove I was having a look the other day that there's they've brought something out to help first time buyers
B	mm
A	but I'm still never going to be able to get together half of the deposit for round here
B	not on your own
A	not on my own
B	and that it's not just the deposit
A	mm mm
B	who will lend your mortgage
A	exactly
B	because your mortgage will probably be in the region of you know six hundred to nine hundred pound a month
A	yeah
B	could you afford that?
A	no
B	could you find a lender to lend it to you even if you get the deposit?
A	mm
B	but I mean do you actually want to own a house? Or do you think you should own one?
A	I'd like to own a house
B	right
A	at the same time it's not on my list of priorities
B	yeah
A	versus travelling around the world with a backpack on my back
B	right yeah
A	like it would be nice to have the stability that if I owned a house here I could rent it out
B	mm
A	Cos my worry is if I go away I don't know what's gonna happen to the jobs market
B	mm
A	I don't know what's gonna happen to house prices
B	mm
A	if I go away and come back it's going to be difficult
B	mm
A	and I need to leave myself enough money to come back to and that's why I want to work in the same field that I'm working in now
B	mm
A	because I don't want er to come back and an employer say well why did you go fruit picking for a year when you had a perfectly good career so
B	yeah
A	I don't want to go fruit picking but
B	mm
A	and at least in that regard I have found a job that I do want to do
B	mm
A	I don't know
B	I think
A	I feel like I think about it all the time and I never actually do anything so
B	I think what you need to do is you need to get either a journal or a massive blank piece of paper and write it all down to try and untangle this web
A	yeah
B	what is the most important to you
A	exactly
B	what everyone thinks everyone should be doing and colleagues and going for promotion and going for a house and doing this and all that
A	mm
B	if you are super happy travelling and that's the thing that makes you happy that's what you have to go for
A	do that
B	but I think that you probably need to just sort of take some time you know sort of get it all down on paper maybe
A	yeah
B	and what do you want? And there's like a couple of like techniques
A	mm
B	would you look back and think I wish I'd done this or that was a bad idea or I should have done more about that
A	mm
B	of trying to help you figure out what's important
A	mm
B	and all that other kind of stuff
A	mm mm
B	um yeah I mean in theory they'll all probably make a lot of sense
A	mm
B	there's loads and loads of different causes of panic attacks
A	oh right
B	my brain
A	mm
B	would start analysing and over-analysing everything
A	oh okay
B	like oh God I feel a bit sick
A	oh God
B	so I think it mine was kind of like from boredom
A	mm
B	and also like loneliness
A	mm
B	and like a lack of people to talk to and stuff like that
A	mm
B	um
A	too much going on in my brain
B	well maybe
A	uh
B	right
A	yeah yeah
B	erm
A	oh man
B	that is so true
A	that's hard isn't it?
B	it's absolutely terrifying
A	mm
B	like me I haven't been out for a meal in quite a while
A	mm
B	because for whatever reason
A	mm
B	the only way to get through it is to go along and do it and everything
A	better
B	like when I didn't want to go flying anywhere
A	yeah
B	and I was absolutely terrified
A	mm
B	I was horror blah blah
A	Good
B	erm the thing is like even going out for a simple drink
A	mm
B	A busy place whatever
A	mm
B	avoid it like the plague
A	mm
B	but you have to put yourself in it
A	yeah and that makes it worse
B	and if you  And if you  run off before you've experienced it
A	mm
B	that's how you build up the fear
A	yeah
B	it's the hardest thing in the world
A	mm
B	and it's just so terrifying when you're in the minute
A	mm
B	er whatever and meeting new people
A	being at a festival
B	and festivals and all that sort of stuff
A	yeah
B	no
A	I think you're right
B	it's a jumble
A	and that's what panics me
B	yeah
A	is that there's is that I'm ageing every day
B	yeah
A	but at least if I was you know I was living in a crack den but it's okay cos I'm saving money and it means that in a year I'm going to be doing something amazing
B	mm
A	but for now I can just take every day as it is and enjoy it
B	mm
A	because I'm working towards something
B	yeah
A	so I'm not living in the future
B	yeah
A	now
B	yeah
A	Cos you do sort of inevitably get swept up in the the wheel of the office and you know oh well will I get promoted and will I get a bit more money
B	mm
A	I think if I stayed there I would be living in
B	yeah
A	but it's just dire for men
B	mm
A	you know there's not an awful lot going on
B	yeah it's quite touristy
A	it's quite touristy
B	it was the monsoon season
A	I don't know whether we picked the best dates
B	it was August I mean what and what else can you do? I mean
A	we did  We did  get to see some tortoise porn
B	oh God like
A	rape of a turtle
B	chasing for a rape yeah
B	that's not travelling
A	that was like you know sort of ten days
B	yeah
A	nice couple of days in Berlin
B	yeah
A	whereas when I was in Australia I was on my own
B	yeah
A	and I get really excited
B	what's stopping you from booking a flight in two months and going with Nicky over there?
A	money
B	and do you not have the funds?
A	no cos you have to have five thousand US dollars in your bank account when you enter the country
B	mm
A	and your flights would be like fifteen hundred pounds
B	if you had ten thousand pounds would you?
A	I'd go now
B	you would go
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	because really it's only money
B	yeah
A	and that's what stopping me
B	yeah
A	it seems unlikely
B	yeah
A	when I'm old and decrepit if we haven't destroyed the planet by then
A	er yes so I don't know
B	yeah
A	mid-April
B	yeah
A	and that'll be the start of it
B	yep
A	Stockholm she's just gonna move to
B	okay right
A	Cos she's finding it really tough
B	really why?
A	I think when you finish uni it's horrendous isn't it? Because
B	I can't remember
A	reality bites
B	oh I can't remember
B	yeah something different
A	and while you were doing your erm civil service training
B	ooh I don't I er generally don't know where I've been
A	two thousand and one
B	for the last twenty-eight years
A	er twenty-nine years
B	erm yes yes
A	but she's er I think she's not in a job she particularly enjoys
B	mm
A	and she's in
B	yeah
A	it's just I think reality is such it's such a hard fall when you finish uni like
B	yeah
A	what it's like when you're at uni
B	mm
A	every night you're doing something and
B	yeah
A	you come down to reality with a quite a hard bang
B	yeah true true true yeah
A	so she's finding it quite tough
A	but it was at the time when my mum and dad were together when I was living in the house and
B	yeah
A	I think they were quite understanding
B	okay
A	obviously you don't pay rent or anything
B	yeah
A	but now erm
B	yeah
A	but she pays I think she pays a hundred and fifty pounds a month
B	yeah
A	so it's pretty cheap
B	you are so savvy
A	er I would like to say I am
B	find a dealer
A	I need to get them
B	mm
A	but they would have been seven hundred pounds new so
B	what about doing the lottery?
A	lottery
B	or maybe taking up gambling
A	gambling could be the answer
B	gotta be in it to win it
A	I mean while while we're there why not prostitution? High class escorting
B	how much do you wanna go abroad?
A	A lot
B	I don't think there's any wrong with it
B	I'm not talking about street walking
A	no high class  high class  escort
B	establishments
A	well that's that's the idea
B	you have got a good body
A	I've got wobbly bits
B	where?
A	everywhere
B	well it's
A	because second jobs are not the answer unless they are escorting
B	yeah too exhausting
A	too exhausting
B	no
A	yeah
B	do all those bits and pieces on yourself
A	I was just thinking because between now and September I can save money from my salary which would be like a hundred and fifty pounds a month maybe
B	is that all you can save?
A	well I just think
B	that's quite a lot
A	oh
B	that is so expensive
A	it's just everything
B	petrol's so expensive yep
B	yep
A	shall say
B	that's your income
A	per calendar month yeah
B	yep
A	after tax
B	yep
A	so coming out of that is three five five for rent
B	and that includes all bills
A	that include all bills
B	yeah
A	A hundred and fifty which is my careers development loan
B	yep
A	twenty-six which is my phone bill
B	yeah
A	say sixty quid for a tank of petrol
B	yeah
A	but I could er obviously that's a a place to shave money
B	yeah possibly yeah
A	erm say what a hundred pounds for food? Would it be more than that? That's like twenty quid a week
B	do you ever buy lunches and stuff like that? And
A	no I try and make soup every week
B	yeah
A	that includes lunches
B	okay
A	and then spending money
B	do you have a gym membership or anything like that?
A	let it go
B	fifty quid a week
A	and DVDs and all
B	cinema and all that sort of stuff
A	yeah
B	I thought you were gonna say it makes you wanna go out
A	it does make me wanna go out
B	and be an old hab
A	right
B	no I don't
A	here you go
B	five
B	for fuck's sake
A	really retarded
B	yeah you've got at least four hundred
B	what did you do?
B	yeah clearly
A	maths was never my strong point
A	have you proved me right?
B	yes
A	oh what's that say?
B	right
A	I must have pressed it er too many times
B	right
A	so we could say four hundred
B	to take that up to
A	petrol
B	petrol to be forty
A	forty pounds
B	forty-nine I think
A	yeah but just in case you can just say forty
B	now what the issue is here
A	that's pretty meagre that is
B	that's clothes
A	yeah
B	travel
A	yeah
B	and that is only fifty pounds a week
A	I mean it sounds pretty generous when you say it like that but in reality as we know like if you go to the cinema
B	you got that so I'll get this or I'll
A	you know like if we're at the bar she's like sort of cos she's on cloud cuckoo land
B	okay
A	she'll just be faffing around
B	oh like
A	yeah it's sort of like
B	not cos she's not got the money just cos she's a bitch
A	no
B	yeah
A	and it's not like she's tight
B	you need to be
A	she's not a
B	yeah
A	I just think right I'm I'm gonna I'm just gonna sort it because otherwise we'll be here forever
B	right well you need to
A	but I need to not do that
B	yeah
A	and just let her
B	and that
A	mm
B	scream and say why have you gotta be so fucking tight
B	but erm but but in the end like I'd be like that
A	mm
B	oh yeah of course
A	yeah
B	Cos she's generous
A	yeah
B	she's generous but she'll just never
A	she's just a bit scatty
B	yeah
A	which is the same as
B	yeah
A	say it's Australia I would need to have so on entry into the country you need to have five thousand dollars
B	which is?
A	which is three thousand five hundred pounds
B	yeah
A	but you also wanna pay for your flights
B	which are what?
A	about fifteen hundred pounds
B	okay
A	and that was Christmas
B	okay
A	and I won't be flying to mental places
B	okay
A	so if you think  So if you think  in May
B	yeah
A	because that'll be the recordings
B	okay
A	I suppose I could put more in because it'll be the recordings plus the start of my
B	yeah
A	say say in May we that's the point where we start
B	yeah in only ten months
A	so I need to be
B	er let me just double check your maths
A	February maybe
B	erm
A	yeah
B	so you can technically
A	I'd book in March probably
B	yeah
A	that would give me five thousand pounds
B	yeah
A	and I'd want to have at least that really
B	it's a lot sooner than we thought actually
A	yeah
B	do you not?
A	no
B	how much would you save by moving home though? Not that much
A	not that much because I'd have to give my mum
B	how much does she want? A hundred and eighty
A	A hundred and fifty
B	hundred
A	I'd save two hundred pounds more every month for
B	um but actually if that if that was just for September October November Jan Feb and you knew you were off in March for example
A	it would literally be six months
B	yeah
A	it's worth doing isn't it?
B	so then technically you could almost leave earlier then
A	but then my plan was always to leave in March next year
B	oh
A	Cos I decided in March right that's it I've gotta get out
B	okay
A	so March is fine
B	okay
A	okay well that's er that's actually made me feel quite calm
B	the really hard thing though is
A	not spending any money
B	yeah
A	yeah you have
B	that is why I'm just like that
A	but you've done really well like in Berlin you could've just sacked it off
B	yeah
A	you could have come home every weekend
B	yeah
A	mm
B	I give money to my mum
A	mm
B	and I'm in Pret for at least breakfast at least lunch possibly breakfast as well
B	erm I might use my Oyster to go on the tube
A	mm
B	clothes
A	yeah
B	do you like my jeans?
B	I've got them in like a really nice coral colour as well from Dorothy Perkins
A	ah lush
B	Cos once I found they fitted I trawled all the Dorothy Perkins cos on line they only had a six
A	oh
B	yeah
B	yeah so I went round all the Dorothy Perkins shops
A	no they're really nice
B	cos they're a really nice fit aren't they? They're really nice
A	no but you also have been trawling the charity shops so it's not like you've been
B	yes
A	you know totally splashing the cash
B	yeah no no
A	exactly
B	yeah
A	erm
B	but at least I'm in a I'm in a sort of similarish position as you
A	mm
B	but it's different because my when I was in Berlin my next step was right come home
A	mm
B	and I'm home now and I'm just like yeah it's all just sort of ticking along
A	but then so is this job just temporary then?
B	yeah
A	you can't stay in the Counter Terrorism Unit once the Olympics is over?
B	no
A	right I see
B	no at that grade unless I pass my FAB in May
A	oh no
B	ah
A	oh man
B	it's a two and a half hour exam
A	that's not the scary one where you were telling me where they have like the people coming in and the actors and they're playing like
B	oh no
A	oh fine
B	this one is just a written exam
A	oh right
A	that's a no from me
B	yeah so erm that's my plan but
A	mm
B	you should talk to
A	she is the best person to speak to about not spending any money
B	she's the ultimate
A	fuck
B	a lot of money
A	yeah
B	whereas she'll be like that
A	mm
B	erm and she'll be like that
A	oh right
B	I've seen her bank statements
A	wow
B	whatever
A	and she is determined though isn't she
B	she'll do it
A	what about
A	do you think it's on the cards?
A	off off the cards? On the rocks
B	no I I don't know
A	yeah she'll always be second
B	yeah she will be
A	I suppose then he's a bit funny isn't he
B	yeah
A	and you enjoy whatever it is that you're doing
B	yeah
A	ha
B	and then
A	yeah
B	I was like alright? And
A	mm
B	and then erm
A	she moved into
B	she moved to
A	yeah
B	but
A	it's good isn't it
B	have you visited her yet?
A	yeah I've been a couple of times
B	yeah
A	and the doors do slam like she lives in a prison
B	yeah
A	on a hill
B	oh God
A	are made of lead and they do slam
B	oh God
A	it's really funny
B	really nice yeah
A	I mean she was living in a  in a  room
B	yeah
A	and then one girl moved out and she got bumped up the list of good rooms
B	okay
A	yeah and then work your way up depending on how long you've been there
B	do you know what's so funny though Liz? Take for example
A	I'll have a look
B	yeah
A	it must have been
B	I mean her husband Steve has now just quit his teacher training
A	cheats on her every left right and centre
B	yeah but it it and he's quit his teacher training now
A	fuck
B	I mean it's not  it's not  a huge amount but oh
A	it's enough to buy a house
B	it yeah it depends
A	only if you've got an income yeah
B	yeah cos you need a mortgage
A	no one's gonna lend to you without
B	yeah
A	a fixed income
B	yeah
A	no
B	Cos that is absolutely sod's law
A	well absolutely
B	yeah
A	but erm I meet I might meet the man of my dreams out there
B	mm
A	is my thinking that I couldn't actually go with
B	oh how?
A	kill her
B	oh right
A	she's lovely
B	okay
B	what cos she's a bit of a space cadet or?
A	yeah we're just
B	right
A	over a long period of time we would really grate on each other
B	mm
A	erm but that might tie in cos her flight's booked her return flight's booked for February
B	mm mm
A	Cos she can extend it up to three times
B	yeah
A	A couple of months after that
B	so you you'd need you need a
A	well I I'm only going on what
B	yeah
A	but when I flew at Christmas
B	yeah
A	on Boxing day they were one thousand pound return
B	okay
A	so I'm figuring it would be less than that
B	Cos what I'd be inclined to do would be whenever you hit enough money for the flight
A	book the flights
B	is to book the flights
A	yeah that's true
B	because then that way
A	I've gotta go
B	you're going
A	yeah
B	because I know oh at one point you were talking about going this January
A	yeah but then I got the new job
B	yeah
A	which is why I didn't go
B	yeah
A	I was gonna go at the end of the year
B	yeah
A	because actually it makes more sense go with that skill set
B	yeah
A	behind me because then it it would open up more doors than the job that I was doing before for Chloe
B	yeah
A	erm and er really my plan was when we got back from Croatia to stay at and to stay at my mum's and work my arse off
B	hammer it
A	and not spend any money
B	oh yeah
A	like I had to pay my deposit and
B	mm
A	we'd been on holiday so there was
B	mm
A	you know you're already
B	mm
A	you know having spent money there and it just wasn't very feasible
B	mm
A	but I think yeah you're right
B	when at what  at what  point of of the year are they cheap? Cos you know like if you book them really far in advance you get an early bird deal or
A	mm
B	okay
A	this sort of time really
A	yeah
B	booking for a winter flight do you mean?
A	yeah
B	is that the cheapest way?
A	I suppose from this point on
B	yeah
A	between April and September are the cheapest flights cos that's when it's winter
B	okay
A	and obviously that hits a head at Christmas cos it's the hottest part and it's Christmas so
B	yeah yeah
A	if my flights on boxing day were a thousand pounds
B	mm
A	but that was with erm budget China bucket airlines
A	which only had one
B	nice
A	but the thing is if you're  if you're  not that fussed when you go surely you can find a flight
B	A flexible one
A	and you know like if you  if you  there're like eight changeovers you can get really cheap flights
B	yeah
A	you can go on standby
B	yeah
A	and live at the airport for a week
B	what about working for an airline quickly?
A	very very quickly
B	qantas
A	ah
B	very quickly
A	very
A	there might be some sort of law about not getting like perks for the first three months
B	oh I see
A	you might have to pass your probation and then you're fucked
B	yeah
A	mm
B	but like figuring out what is it you fancy doing when you get there
A	yeah
B	sort of make it a reality
A	I think when I started thinking about it I thought well I'd fly into Melbourne because that's where
B	ah
A	if it's it's quite I could stay with
B	ah
A	very temporarily
B	yeah
A	and just say to her look can I just sleep on your floor for a couple of weeks? I'll take a sleeping bag
B	mm
A	I mean like have a nice time settling in and you know be with her
B	yeah
A	erm but it would take time so I'd like do a bit of sight-seeing in that time
B	yeah
A	or it depends on her situation
B	mm
A	and then work there for maybe six months
B	yeah
A	and then keep money and then come home through Asia
B	yeah
A	I'd like to go over to New Zealand as well
B	yeah
A	like one of my colleagues
B	nice
A	the South island
B	ah how sweet
A	and she's really cute
B	ah
A	so they're both really clever
B	that is love man
A	it took her ten years to do her PhD because she decided to have kids in between
B	fool
A	hilarious
B	I pity the fool
A	she's really smart
B	yeah
A	so that I don't use up all my funds
B	is there any way of? Does your company have a branch in Australia?
A	yeah it does
B	mm
A	and I've just I've never ever seen a job advertised for the Melbourne office
B	yeah
A	and erm see if a job ever comes up
B	yeah and you don't know also like even if they don't have a job maybe they know someone that looks for temporary people to do marking of er some sort of thing like you do at IELTS marking or something like that
A	yeah yeah
B	I mean you just don't really know
A	well I think I would definitely get in contact with people in the office there and just say well I'm planning to move over and I just wondered if you've got jobs or how you go about recruiting people through the office and
B	yeah
A	just sort of branch out really
B	mm
A	even though we've spoken
B	yeah
A	so yeah
B	yeah
A	'Tis a plan
B	yes I'm glad I came cos otherwise you probably would have figured out you could save eight thousand pounds an hour
B	or it would take you twenty years to save up five grand or something
A	yeah you you've erm you've certainly helped me with the maths there
B	whoa
A	God what the hell's the matter with me?
B	ha
A	I think from this point on I need to just start being more savvy with money
B	have you paid for all of your
A	yeah basically
B	keep an eye on
A	budget for before
B	yeah
A	so Brighton I'm gonna drive down just just for the sake of convenience but I think I need to think is it actually worth driving when I could get National Express and stuff
B	yeah
A	it's first thing on Saturday morning
B	mm
A	it's much easier to do that
B	where are you staying on the Saturday night then?
A	in the hotel
B	okay
A	in Kemptown
B	oh right you are
A	and then I'll just pop in and see her on Sunday or something but erm
B	yeah
A	for for
B	yep
A	I wonder if you could get quite a cheap train ticket versus spending like twenty-five quid on petrol
B	mm
A	or thirty quid on petrol
B	God you're gonna have to be really dedicated
A	yeah
B	like you're gonna
A	it's gonna be a real test
B	if it all boils down  if it all boils down  to money basically
A	which it does
B	then you have to make those sacrifices
A	mm
B	those short term sacrifices
A	well that's why I've said no to all the hen parties
B	oh no but that is just so hard
A	it's really hard because I was so looking forward to Barcelona and I hadn't seen
B	yeah
A	and Barcelona's beautiful
B	yeah and you really like Barcelona
A	and I mean it might even get to the point where I cancel Belfast
B	yeah
A	April and May
B	I mean technically these things could all be done on the
A	yeah
B	costly
A	but like if it was in
B	yeah
A	so that's going to be cheaper than getting the train to
B	yeah
A	and It's
B	yeah should be about fifty P a pint
A	er at least
B	otherwise you're on tap water
A	yes
B	yeah
A	I tried once and got really bored with it
B	I'm addicted now
A	are you?
B	yeah
A	mm
B	have a look online
A	mm
B	Cos sometimes people you know try and sell something
A	mm
B	so like keep an eye on stuff that's actually selling and see see if you've got any like labelled clothes for example
A	mm
B	you know
A	yeah well not with my Primani wardrobe but certainly
B	but you will wanna take that with you if you went travelling though wouldn't you? Or
A	well it's an eight mega-pixel camera which is what my phone is
B	oh really?
A	but I suppose I wouldn't be able to use my phone so that's actually quite a good point
B	I mean it I mean those sorts of things though
A	mm
B	like when you need to hike it up
A	yeah true
B	I mean I suppose when you do move away you would
A	sell the bed yeah
B	if even if you ended up having to free-cycle it
A	yeah
B	or put it into storage
A	mm
B	erm
A	just see how you go
B	yeah
A	yeah cos basically all this stuff
B	mm
A	or you might just be
B	A hobo
B	A nomad
A	A hobo
B	wait
A	as a nickname yeah
B	okay
A	yeah
B	is she emigrating with work?
A	erm
B	family?
A	I think she's got a girlfriend out there or something I don't
B	okay
A	no I don't really know
B	attempt
A	like seriously will you just leave now
B	bye
A	stop coming back
B	what does your mum make to everything?
A	I think she knows that restless
B	yeah
A	she knows that I've got itchy feet and I think she worries that I think she probably it's a double edged sword
B	really?
A	I think she wants me to go because otherwise I'll always wonder why
B	yeah
A	and like feel like I've missed out
B	yeah
A	I think she feels a bit sad about that
B	yeah
A	and she likes the fact that now that
B	yeah
A	and we had to go and sit in the garden because it was so warm
B	oh and your mum has got a gorgeous garden as well
A	and mum's got a really nice garden
B	yeah without making sort of plans six months in advance to meet up or something
A	yeah exactly
B	yeah
A	too long
B	I've
A	well if I finished my degree in September O nine
B	okay so
A	two and a half years
B	where did you do your degree?
B	oh yeah
A	yeah
B	two and a half years
A	yeah
B	limit for like doing something or being somewhere or something like that
A	that's the point when you're like well what's next then
B	what's next? Yeah yeah exactly
A	yeah definitely
B	yeah
A	Cos it might take you you know that's the problem where you think right I've got to change
B	yeah
A	but it's that point where you think right well I've gotta do something about this
B	yeah
A	erm
B	ah
A	I'd love her to
B	ah
A	because you know they've never really travelled themselves and like that's quite upsetting that thought but they don't notice
B	but
B	but I was talking to a guy someone's flatmate on Saturday night and um he didn't use his passport until five years ago
A	mm
B	and he's been to Egypt and something else since
A	mm mm
B	in Peru
A	okay
B	our age
A	okay
B	yeah so I mean it's not for everyone
A	it's interesting to know
B	yeah
A	yeah I think both of them would love to see more of the world
B	do you think?
A	but yeah and I know my dad would
B	would
A	yeah definitely
B	yeah
A	he'd love it
B	is he? Can he not afford it then? Or?
A	no no he'd never be able to afford it
B	that he erm I would find that really frustrating if I worked my whole life
A	yeah
B	and I couldn't afford to do what I wanted to do
A	mm
B	go to New Zealand Australia whatever blah blah
A	and it
B	yeah definitely
A	but that's not
B	mm
A	they met
B	mm
A	I think you know it still kills me that it's just not what how my dad thought it was gonna be
B	yeah
A	but that's life
B	mm
A	it's the best of a bad situation
A	yeah
B	he's pregnant?
A	well he's not pregnant
B	I was like a pregnant man? Like that pregnant man thing
B	fucking hell
A	well no
B	his wife is pregnant
A	his wife is pregnant and then
B	you're not allowed to be an aunty cos you don't talk to your brother
A	I don't talk to him no
B	yeah
A	I've spoken to
B	Cos the oldest one must be what eight ten years old?
A	ah no
B	why did they decide to have a kid now then?
A	I don't think they did
B	okay
A	well er
B	she's forty-one? I mean in the grand scheme of things that's probably quite old for kids
A	well she'll be forty-one when the baby's born
B	when's it being born?
A	September
B	but you're gonna have to reconcile with
A	well I sent him a text message the next day I think just saying oh erm congratulations
B	that's good of you yeah
A	well I just thought er you know now is the time
B	yeah
A	but I didn't and erm he didn't
B	he didn't? Oh he didn't yeah yeah
A	he didn't get in contact
B	mm
A	er never mind the fact that he's only like an hour down the road
B	it's his first baby?
A	yeah his first baby
B	yeah okay yeah
A	so my dad's proper first grandchild
A	but they're
B	ah ah
A	she was
B	right
A	I don't know but um I mean financially they can afford it
B	yeah
A	it's really risky erm I think it's more risky if you haven't had a child
B	right
A	which she has
B	yeah
A	so it lowers the risk
B	mm
A	um but everything is healthy
B	what was it? I know I always ask you this
A	erm he it was the Christmas before last and it had been er just over a year
B	yeah
A	and I think the year before dad had seen him on Christmas day because they hadn't had the girls
B	yeah
A	so that's what they done
B	yeah
A	um but just let me know and I'll try and organise stuff as well
B	yeah
A	and he wrote back just saying well if you know we've not got the girls
B	he needn't have written that
A	so it was really cutting
B	yeah
A	I didn't reply and
B	yeah
A	I thought am I being really selfish
B	it's not true
A	I'm the eldest
B	yeah
A	and it's not fucking true
B	yeah it's not true
A	yeah and where has it come from? It's come let out of left centre
B	left field yeah
A	left field because all I ever do is try and make sure that his feelings are taken into consideration so you can fuck off
B	mm
A	so even like last Christmas my dad didn't see him for like two or three weeks after Christmas
B	guilty
A	erm
B	but nice nice
A	my dad was like my dad called me and was like I've got a new TV
A	he was so excited
B	yeah
A	talk about buying your love
B	yeah
A	he lives just down the road
B	yeah
A	there's absolutely no excuse
B	yeah
A	and he had the the balls to say to me that I don't love my dad
B	that's so weird
A	and this just came after a long list of you know the wedding saga
B	mm
A	and and meeting him in
B	yeah
A	and er me thinking like that was us turning a corner
B	yeah turning the corner yeah
A	but never then never hearing from him and
B	yeah
A	and he didn't call her
B	something substantial yeah
A	um
B	why do you think that?
A	and came for a party and stuff
B	ooh someone
A	he just did nothing and I just though you know what
B	it's really weird
A	it's rude
B	yeah it's rude
A	um
B	problem is it is getting quite late I've got um I'm seeing this lady in
A	oh yeah
A	yeah yeah
B	it's tomorrow now
A	what time is it?
B	well it's at two
A	right
B	but the problem is that because I can never rely on the damn traffic
A	mm
B	I just don't know
A	you're not confident
B	you can't guarantee how long you'll be on the M25 for
A	mm
B	and I don't wanna miss it
A	erm no real plans for the day
B	oh clothes?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	and stuff that I got for Moulin Rouge
B	oh for the dressing up party?
A	yeah the burlesque thing
B	Good girl
A	take that back
B	are you sure you can't sell it?
A	it's something that I got from a charity shop
B	A good find
A	and then I found some stains on it so rank
B	nice
A	nice is nice
B	okay
A	and I've got a few things to get from Boots
B	okay
A	um
B	who's Claire and Matt?
A	Claire is my work buddy
B	ah
A	erm we started on the same day
B	oh right
A	erm she's a really nice girl actually
B	okay
A	erm so she's in charge of that
B	okay
A	erm really really clever but really sort of down to earth with it which is nice
B	yeah oh that's good
A	but he's he's just up there
B	okay
A	with his cleverness
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	it's always a bit safer
B	yeah
A	or maybe we should just go for a pint
B	otherwise you'll get absolutely wasted
A	absolutely wasted
B	oh God
A	yeah fifty quid on the card
B	yeah
A	it's not me
B	just run off yeah
A	I don't know
B	which one? Which bit?
A	which bit? I think pop in and see mum briefly on Saturday
B	what's she doing with herself then? Sort of keeping herself busy a and that
A	current affairs yeah
B	yeah okay
A	yeah just all of the usual really
B	yeah
A	she's um
B	gardening and
A	she's got a friend who's got cancer and it's really yeah
B	oh God
A	um and she's been helping her out
B	mm
A	she's been helping her out with a bit of like sorting her life out basically
B	yeah
A	but I think it obviously it's massively draining on my mum
B	mm
A	obviously she's a
B	it's difficult yeah
A	er I think she's alright
B	Good
A	the thing is she doesn't ever talk to me
B	I had that third hand though
A	you had that yeah
B	third hand though
A	oh
B	yeah
A	Good
B	yeah
A	right
B	yeah
A	yeah um
B	but who do
A	I hope so
B	someone else
A	yeah and and in fact I'm pretty sure she does
B	yeah
A	and I think it's just that she feels like she doesn't want to burden me with it
B	yeah
A	yeah which is
B	yeah
A	also want her to to know that she can if she wants to but
B	yeah
A	also selfishly I sort of don't want her to
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	and it should be all upward
A	it should be all upward
B	that's it
A	we have
B	and now it's our turn to send it upwards and let them
A	yeah keep the crazy up there
B	yeah yeah
B	yeah
A	she likes her garden and she's
B	yeah
A	I think she had quite a difficult time of it
B	mm
A	right let's get on it and that's why I try to go round like at least once a week
B	yeah
A	I mean obviously I don't want to worry about her that in extent
B	no
A	but it's nice to sort of check in and
B	yeah
B	but isn't
A	she's always been like that
B	mm
A	like even if you won't a depressive
B	mm
A	that'd be fucking hard and
B	it wasn't sort of diagnosed and it wasn't?
A	it wasn't diagnosed until he was a teenager and and also having your husband doubt you
B	mm
A	it's to not feel support from her her husband
B	mm
A	I think he was just incapable of doing it because he didn't really want to believe that his son had this condition
B	yeah
A	and because it's so intangible
B	mm
A	and it was quite unknown at the time and
B	it's subjective as well
A	he
B	you
A	mm
B	that it that such a condition exists and wouldn't just put it down to
A	mm
B	badly behaved
A	yeah
B	or unruly or blah blah blah
A	that's certainly what people were telling her
B	yeah
A	so I think for those reasons you know that was obviously a massive part of why she moved out of  so
B	yeah
A	um and ultimately what led to the end of their marriage
B	mm
A	I think because she had a really crappy upbringing
B	mm
A	A really really rubbish time and um it's amazing like you know  told you about that book
B	mm
A	it just starts from such a young age
B	mm
A	like with her she's worked really hard not to
B	mm
A	like she could have been one of those parents on Jeremy Kyle that's horrible to their kids and you know
B	mm
A	she's deliberately gone the other way and always makes an effort
B	mm
A	you know I love you and I care about you and I'm proud of you
B	mm
A	but I mean actions speak louder than words as well
B	mm
A	and um you know with  you know with your family you do get a lot of support from your family even if there there's not like the vocal
B	yeah
A	follow up there
B	yeah
A	so yeah I think you know this is sort of the way it is now
B	mm
A	um
B	huh
A	shall I meet
B	what is?
A	shall we meet him for a coffee now?
B	yes
A	no you've gotta meet him
B	I'll drive you there
A	well I'll go and pick him up was what I was thinking
B	coffee?
A	everyone knows what coffee at half past eight everyone knows what coffee means
B	oh do they? I didn't
A	I'll have a
B	I didn't know that coffee meant something else
A	well
B	I better do a wee
A	we we both agreed the honeymoon's over
B	huh
A	I think we're too
B	maybe that's what the kids
A	we're too old for all that carry on
B	I don't know I would  I would  have genuinely thought coffee meant coffee and abs meant abs
A	you'd be forgiven for thinking it though
B	I didn't know it meant slap and tickle and slap and tickle mark two
A	all of the above
B	no I should make a move anyway
A	well I don't want to chase you out but I would
B	no no yeah I've gotta make a move anyway
A	I would rather you stayed here if it got late
B	yeah no no I'll go
B	I've gotta get back anyway
A	um
B	I've gotta get back but it was so nice seeing you
A	ah
B	I've haven't seen you in well not it's not ages
A	it's been about two months
B	yeah I haven't seen
B	I was supposed to go round on Sunday for tea and cake
A	yeah absolutely
B	and then at the last minute
A	yeah
B	literally that morning she just text me then goes oh I've got to take my car to my parent's house
A	right
B	and I was like fine not a problem at all
A	curious though
B	and then we arranged to talk on the phone and then I rang her and she's like oh
A	ah
B	with and that means we cannot talk now
B	why can we not talk because
A	why is he even there?
B	well we know you're together but that's just what does that mean? I mean um but why couldn't we talk anyway? Just cos
A	yeah
B	it was really weird
A	is it because she wants to talk about him?
B	yeah it must have been
A	but why was she not in
B	well surely
A	have they fallen out?
B	I don't think they ever lived together cos
A	oh did she?
B	yeah so they don't actually
A	ah
B	sort of know each other like that
A	oh God I'd forgotten all the ins and outs of it
B	mm
A	in the  house
B	who?
A	is she still living in your room?
B	yeah
A	oh yeah you said
B	so they've all got to move out by May the something
A	is it
B	yeah but the other girl has bought a house
A	mm
B	and then erm
A	staying in London?
B	yep
A	right
B	Cos her
A	oh nice
B	I've gotta pee man
A	you've gotta pee
B	are you going straight round now?
A	er
B	wait are you going for
A	no I just pick him up
B	and then where do you go then?
A	er well back here
B	that is brilliant
A	bootie call yeah
B	I mean
A	but that's what  that's what  he's always been
B	well let me pee then
A	well this is the first time it'll have happened
B	oh really
A	and it'd been quite a couply thing
B	yeah
A	and the next day I think he kind of freaked out
B	yeah yeah
A	and we had a conversation and er I was like I don't wanna see you as as a boyfriend
B	yeah don't worry
A	I'm just having a good time
B	yeah
A	well okay then
B	what does he look like? Have you got a photo of him? Are you friends with him on Facebook?
A	he's not on Facebook
B	do what I do with Ed and just go like that
B	right okay
A	I hear they really appreciate that
B	I think when everyone's drunk you can get away with that sort of stuff
A	this is true
B	be in the morning and everything so
A	okay
B	ya
A	quarter to bedtime
B	erm bedtime
A	Jesus
B	they're bastards
B	as you said
