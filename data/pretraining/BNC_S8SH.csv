A	so are
A	especially with the alteration challenge
B	yes which is you know fair enough they haven't got long but
A	mm
B	but some of them do seem a little on the ragged side and they do seem to use patterns
A	yes
B	you
A	I think this time I think in
B	what do you mean?
A	well they had to fit it directly on the person or they had to make a paper pattern I can't quite remember
B	mm
A	but there was something but there is one part I mean generally there's one part where they have to they're given a pattern and they have to make it up
B	yes
A	which is reasonable isn't it? cos that's
B	well it yes I mean they have been choosing their own patterns but and they had patterns for jackets and things but er you know some of the more simple stuff I suppose the er what do you call it? the revamping things
A	mm
B	is a bit more
A	alteration challenge
B	the alteration challenge is a bit erm a bit different on that but er
A	they're sort of making something out of a pattern then aren't they? although some people make their own paper one
B	yeah
A	but they tend to be a bit a lot of those tend to be more loose garments don't they?
B	yes
A	mm but and er
B	and they can be a bit thrown together
A	yes
B	and sometimes they don't always seem to have the use the material that appropriately I don't think like
A	I think mum would have a few things to say about it cos they have a big piece of material
B	yes
A	and they just pin things all over the place on it
B	mm
A	and er mum was very good wasn't she about erm
B	oh yes well mum was a
A	er making sure it went together as
B	yes
A	but then it does depend on the pattern a bit doesn't it?
B	what the printed the design?
A	the
B	yes
A	wallpaper you have
B	yes
A	repeats then
B	well it does to some extent on the other hand what I haven't seen them doing particularly is opening the material out
A	oh right
B	you know so you would use
A	mm
B	so instead of getting a wasted bit in the middle
A	mm
B	if you well you had to put it against well no if you had to put it against the the er fold er against if you folded it in half to do it double to get the symmetrical shape
A	mm mm
B	well mum wouldn't fold it like they sort of seem to fold it in half and cut it against the fold so
A	yes
B	you get a big scrap along the bottom
A	mm mm
B	of the the selvedge er there whereas mum would only fold it as far down as she needed to cut the size so she'd then have an extra piece of material that was double the size of the scrap they're getting
A	yes yes
B	and you could then put another piece in it so you could cut possibly one bit and then from the bit that was left over that wasn't folded
A	yes
B	she could cut the other bit flat you know refold it down the middle and
A	mm
B	cut out the one the other way by erm moving it up or moving it down slightly cos I remember at school when we used to get
A	mm
B	the pattern a proper shop-bought pattern would say you need two yards
A	yes
B	erm mum would say you don't need
A	mm
B	a yard and a half or whatever it was and er we had to buy the patterns as well so mum used to pin the pattern on the material
A	yes
B	or show me where to pin it on the material
A	mm mm mm
B	erm and I'd take it to school like that and then at school I would put it on more carefully you know she wasn't doing it all for me but she would show so I could show the teacher where the bits went
A	mm
B	but you didn't actually need that extra half a yard
A	yes
B	especially if you were buying some you know reasonably expensive material
A	and anyway it saves the pennies and that was important
B	and that was important but you see mum I mean mum was a tailoress really I know she did dressmaking but high standards cos she did make suits and well she made everything from the skin skin upwards
A	mm
B	outwards erm really cos in those in those days erm during during the war and
A	mm
B	if they could get a bit of parachute silk
A	mm
B	they'd use that for underwear and ladies would go and buy a full matching set of something you know so they'd have the the slip and the knickers and everything and then they'd erm you know they would buy erm sort of an outfit
A	mm
A	mm
B	on suits if you got an old pair of trousers you could make a a decent skirt out of it cos you've got
A	yes
B	four legs
A	mm
B	to play about with so you could cut it in a would it be a
A	mm
B	erm any of those sort of ones that you need seams in so erm she was dab hand at doing that from little bits of material and of course my friend
A	mm
B	so mum and her would be patterning and looking at this that and the other sorting things out
A	did they make things together?
B	er not really I don't think they actually made anything together but they talked about what they were doing
A	mm
B	I don't think she actually helped
A	mm
B	from somewhere or other and erm
A	mm
B	you know with the covered buttons and everything and it looked perfectly decent which is quite a a lot for a sort of sixteen-year-old or so
A	yes
B	to take on
A	although one of those on the telly is
B	yes she's not old is she?
A	I think her name might be Jade
B	yes
A	I don't think she's particularly old
B	no
A	and she was saying the best thing she'd made was her prom dress
B	yeah
A	which looked particularly nicely made
B	well I think she's yes she's a later sort of
A	mm mm
B	teenager I think as well but you know
A	mm
B	cutting this erm
A	mm
B	or same as mum did for me cos I used to draw it and she used to make it
A	mm
B	but er
A	did you see things in magazines or shops? how did you get your ideas? or did you just do them you did you kind of know what people had and make one up?
B	well I kind of saw bits of things I liked and made one up really
A	mm
B	erm cos I
A	well you certainly don't do that
A	mm
B	up to up to your bra strap which was quite erm daring
A	would you
B	yes which you didn't go you
A	mm
B	on your straps
A	mm mm I was looking at one er out of my summer clothing and wondering if I'd sewn that kind of arrangement in because it's always a bit awkward
B	mm
A	when I or whether it came and I couldn't couldn't decide
B	no or or you would use erm a very little tiny gold pins
A	mm
B	erm as well they were useful and if you had a halterneck dress then you'd you'd have a a suitably shaped bra strap
A	yes you wouldn't wear over-the-shoulder straps
B	no no no
A	which people do now like that lady I was talking
B	yes oh I know
A	who had this sort of quite it was a sort of the first hot it was the
B	mm
A	so far and she had this sort of vesty top and this sort of padded erm foamy sort of big cup bra
B	like a Wonderbra?
A	well I don't know do they push up? I'm not sure what a Wonderbra does but
B	I I think it's supposed to enhance one's potential
A	but it
B	yes
A	bent over
B	oh right
A	that sort of really er anyway it there was quite a
B	yes
A	because of the way her her top
B	yes
A	erm
B	yes
A	mm
B	so
A	I can remember you had some er some of your dresses did you have a lot of pinky a silky-looking one? I don't think it was silky
B	it was
A	I think it was a new fabric
B	it was it was it was erm it could have been
A	mm
B	and it it was a sort of apricot I suppose a pale apricot colour and that had a bit of sheen to it and was erm it was a fitted bodice it was sleeveless with a small er with a square neck but not too low
A	oh a square neck yes
B	it had a square neck er it was sleeveless and it came in under the it was fitted under the bust with a tiny band and that bodice was all erm it was ruched up it was lines of sewing and then pinched in to gather so it was all little ruches all the way over
A	oh
B	and it had the same binding on the erm edge of the sleeves and round
A	mm
B	er sleeve armholes
A	mm
B	and round the neck and it was square neck and the back and then it had a sort of A-line skirt not gathered or anything it was just an A-line as was per sixties
A	mm
B	and it was just a bit above the knee
A	are you thinking of a plain one or one with a swirly pattern on?
B	no I'm thinking of a plain one but
A	oh
B	the material had got a slightly erm kind of embossed it wasn't
A	mm
A	mm mm
B	in the same material
A	I always think of that being a a sort of a a kind of peachy orange actually
B	well it yes it wasn't sort of loud the loud one
A	mm
B	I had which you probably liked was the one with the swirly different colours it that was pinky purplely
A	oh with the belt?
B	white er swirly things cos it was like psychedelic I'm
A	oh no
B	the small
A	I was meant I was talking about
B	yes the small
A	yeah
B	I thought the small-scale it's er small-scale swirls
A	mm
B	and it was all sort of like it was was
A	with little white and grey and
B	and yes
A	pink and
B	and and pinky mauvey
A	and looking much nicer
B	swirly
B	swirly things it sounds horrendous but er and that had that again was sleeveless erm with just a plain-faced sleeve er underneath er er armhole underneath and it had a V-neck
A	oh a V-neck
A	oh
B	a flat
A	mm
B	a flat
A	mm
B	and then that was erm had erm darts and darts from the waist so the bodice was fitted erm and it had a it was waisted and it had erm I think it it wasn't it had a slightly flared skirt because it that again was erm was it it wasn't it might have been Tricel there was another word for er it was a man-made fibre but it didn't screw up or anything it was and it was thin
A	mm
B	it was very fine like a silky fine thin material
A	yes
B	er and it had a belt on it with a little buckle and the little pinky erm oblong curved it was it sort of it it was an oblong shape but it had a curve to it
A	mm
B	so it fitted against your waist and that was an old one of mum's from
A	oh
B	I don't know
A	mm
B	and again I had a I think I had a ribbon that time I had a erm ribbony thing that I could do into a bow in the same material and it was it was very bright but it was very nice
A	and you had one with a another belted one
B	and of course having said that it
A	oh
B	mother always tried to put a pocket in somewhere yes
A	and there was one for your cloakroom ticket
B	well well one would have one's handbag but
A	yes
B	for one's hanky
A	oh and you had another one with a belt didn't you? er it had more sort of erm if it seemed a bit more like a shirt
B	oh
A	a purple purple and yellow and
B	no oh
A	not not the pink swirly one no erm
B	I can't think which one that was
A	oh
B	with a belt
A	but another one you had was like erm you had made nighties out of that erm slightly furry fabric
B	furry fabric
A	er you know like like the
B	what was that?
A	well it had little stripes across
B	brushed nylon?
A	brushed nylon is that what you call it?
B	yes
A	it was like a big T-shirt with those pearl buttons on it
B	oh I know what you mean yes yes
A	and they had lots of different colours
B	er yes that was a slightly velvety effect
A	was that brushed nylon or am I rude about it?
B	with a printed erm well it's kind of like that but it was had a slightly erm velvety but it it was a kind of stretchy material and it was like a erm a big T-shirt only not like they wear now that's flappy with the off the shoulder it was erm a properly fitted your size erm
A	mm mm
B	and then erm it went carried on but it was quite narrow it wasn't a flappy T-shirt it was quite fitted on the hips narrow and short and it had got a sort of wavy a wavy pattern
A	mm
B	it wasn't a swirly one it was a wavy pattern
A	mm
B	and it was green and
A	yes it was very pretty
B	lines it was very pretty and it it was quite a a clingy
A	mm
B	type thing and then I of course the fashion came in cos those were kind of
A	mm
A	mm
B	and you tie round but it was it was a bit holey so mum made a lining for it
A	mm
B	so I had a lined one cos she didn't
A	mm
B	think it was quite the thing
A	no
B	to go round showing your holes through the skin through the holes so erm I had this lining which was it was lining material and it was very sort of erm er it was a what would you call it? erm I can't think of the name it was like a satin it got a sheen on it it was the same colour
A	oh right mm
B	as the dress but got a bit of a sheen so
A	mm
B	when the light caught it it was quite
A	mm
B	pretty in the holes and it also kept the shape of the dress better cos some people's
A	mm
B	get longer and things
A	I think you did well not to have the tassels I think they're much overrated
B	yes
A	I'm not sure tassels would have looked very nice on it I think scallop was
B	mm
A	was probably better
B	I always fancied one of those dresses that had that has erm possibly three or four inch er fringe that layers of fringe
A	mm oh yes?
B	you now those?
A	somebody made one on one of the Sewing Bees I think didn't they?
B	yes layers of fringe
A	mm
B	so so it shakes about and you don't have to move much although I used to move quite a lot but you know
A	mm mm
B	erm yes and and then what else do you remember? do you remember my camel and green?
A	oh yes
B	now
A	more a day dress wasn't it?
B	yes camel and green was camel and green was erm one of mother's creations thinking of erm er challenges for alterations
A	mm
B	for me
A	yes
B	because they were the thing at the time
A	mm
B	er cos this would have been er when did I go to college? this would have been late sixties erm and it was if of the era of the two-tone
A	yes
B	er so I thought I'd have this winter erm camel trousers but I don't know they didn't seem to be right so mum took them apart I mean she'd made them sort of very well but they just didn't seem to look right on me
A	no
B	erm she'd fitted them you know when once they were
A	you did have your
B	fitted
A	pantomime horse trousers didn't you later on?
B	well this is it yes they were they were corduroy trousers that looked like
A	I think that was part of the problem actually
B	yes
A	wasn't it?
B	yes mum er we had this pair of trousers and they must have been reasonably straight trousers er and mum made this panelled dress for me it was military-style and it had bottle green
A	mm
B	so it looked kind of a bit like a back of a military jacket front and back
A	mm
B	so that was a bottle green and then the rest of it was these trousers so where the point of the bodice came the yoke came there was a an over-sewn seam down each side and and at the back which also did the fitting for the front
A	mm
B	because you only needed narrow panels
A	mm
B	and because it was a shorter dress you could get it out of the trouser length
A	mm mm
B	erm so that was my camel and green and I wore it for my college interview
A	oh and very appropriate for a
B	yes
B	and erm as I say erm I think
A	mm mm
B	that was one of mum's things and then I had erm there was that very nice it was a long dress was it? I think it was a long dress originally the one in the little pattern that your work bag your er sewing bag is lined in
A	oh yes
B	that was a pretty one but
A	well we all had those long skirts didn't we?
B	yes well this was a dress with a erm a square sort of piece and it had not lace round it
A	mm mm
B	a square erm bit on the front erm yoke sort of erm a square thing and slightly puffed sleeves and long sleeves erm cuffs long cuffs long sleeves and it had grandma's lace round it
A	oh yes
B	that lace was nanny
A	mm
B	little showery things and then mum shortened that for me I think
A	I had a long skirt that eventually got shortened
B	mm but
A	I I'm I I'm I'm wearing on the er driving test
B	yeah oh right
A	you know when I got back when I passed my
B	mm
A	driving test in nine seventy-nine
B	yes
A	so it would have been you know a few years later then
B	yes and mum made lots of different skirts
A	I had to wear
B	all sorts
A	your red skirt to a party I went to when I was about thirteen
B	yes
B	yeah
A	at
B	what red skirt?
A	we had to go out and buy a jumper cos I didn't have anything at all suitable to go going to
B	oh
A	a party in
B	mm what red skirt was that? I can't
A	I don't remember it other than that
B	oh
A	but it wasn't my skirt so you
B	oh
A	it must have been
B	I don't remember having a red skirt
A	obviously it was very short on you and I was a bit shorter because I was younger
B	yes can't remember what one that was now
A	can't remember if it had buttons on or not we had those both had blue and red dresses
B	mm
A	with erm buttons on because yours
B	oh yes that's right
A	was quite subtle and mine was rather bright
B	yes yes
A	I'm not sure I really liked it but erm
B	I think mine was a slightly darker navy
A	mm
B	oh and I remember in earlier days well earlier days probably sixty-seven erm
A	oh
B	on the front and that was very short
A	mm
B	and it was before tights came in
A	oh
B	so you wore stockings
A	mm
B	so and you had erm they were like erm erm lacy sort of openwork erm creamy colour was very popular
A	mm
B	and you had the creamy colour
A	mm
B	stockings and the shorter skirt which took some manoeuvring and then I had a creamy
A	mm
B	tucked in
A	mm
B	you know and then and it was the era of the pale lipstick as well the mascara and the pale lipstick and the backcombed hair yes I remember wearing that the trouble is some of these little skirts and I thought oh that's quite nice material and I couldn't get into them some years later and I unpicked them cos I thought they might nice material
A	mm mm mm
B	make a cushion or something
A	yes
B	which I didn't which is a shame because erm you know these things come round again and there was very some very nice erm like
A	you still might not fit into them
B	I know very nice plaid er erm not plaid check material well there were some plaid we used to have some quite bright plaid ones erm and there was a bluey yellowy one and we used to get or mum used to help knit as well we used to knit a matching
A	yes
B	that knitted matches
A	yes
B	the the knitted erm with some sort of little erm
A	mm
B	like an outfit
A	I think you're wearing one of those but
B	mm
A	in the garden
B	yes
A	because all the colours came out quite strange in those days on
B	yes
A	photographs
B	yes
A	but I think from when they were made not just
B	yes
A	gone off
B	no
A	mm
A	I had a red one from Marks and Spencer's and you had a whitish one didn't you?
B	mm
A	er well white background with
B	yeah
A	colours on
B	oh yes mine was a navy navy and white
A	mm
B	with a red line through I used to know what names these were but I've forgotten
A	I don't think I knew that they had names in those days
B	yes
A	cos I had mine when I was little
B	mm but well I used to have a kilt when I was little as well but in fact I have the pin
A	mm
B	older ones but er yes but er still
A	so you didn't have a dress erm a sixties dress like those ones that they were calling colour block dresses?
B	colour block dress
A	it looked like Mondrian dresses
B	yeah the Mondrian ones no I didn't have one of those I didn't want one of those cos they were everywhere
A	oh were they?
B	yeah erm I well
A	that would be really more a Mondrian wouldn't it?
B	with the colour in yes
A	mm
B	erm
A	yeah two-tone
B	erm that was a music style as well two-tone
A	I think that's rather different rather later
B	yes but it no it erm
B	yes those Midlands bands but like erm they're very much like erm ska
A	mm
B	type of music
A	yes
B	had er Mary Quant hairstyles they cos they were always going up to London buying oh I've forgotten what they're called those boots that had sort of holes rouleau loops and holes in them
A	oh
B	in
A	yes
B	and and even had some shoes made at was it Anello and Davide?
A	really?
B	yeah cos
A	gosh that was quite a posh thing to do to have
B	it is
A	shoes made
B	it was quite posh they had erm because they were like erm I don't know whether they were like quite like granny shoes they were sort of plain ones with buttons with a strap and button over
A	oh right are they called Mary Janes now those ones?
B	er
A	with a little
B	they had a little heel they were much more delicate a bit like more like my
A	mm
B	type of shoes erm and then erm they decided they were gonna have their hair cut
A	mm
B	and
A	oh
B	off off off
A	mm mm
B	and erm
A	not just wonky you mean?
B	no they were
B	designed like that
B	but you have to have a really good cut for it to keep falling in the right place I think
A	yes
B	you know they didn't have identical they had erm a matching
A	gosh
B	but er
A	I expect it would cost a fortune to go up to London these days and have your hair cut
B	yeah
A	it's although I mean perhaps it's no more expensive than having it cut in the
B	yeah
A	really?
A	so perhaps they were quite used to spending quite a lot because
B	yeah
A	I mean I can't imagine mum or dad
B	no
A	doing that
B	well if you remember
A	mm
B	comparatively you know
A	mm
A	mm
B	up to London in in
A	that sounds quite tricky being in a
A	cut-down Mini
A	mm
B	one of these great tanks
A	no no no
B	it was a little Mini
A	I had a little Mini I know little Minis
B	I know yes
A	there's not a lot of space but
B	no
A	on that occasion we did manage to get six or seven people in in it
B	mm
A	for reasons that erm
B	mm
A	nineteen ninety because that was on the occasion of dad marrying
B	yeah must have been yeah anyway we went up to London
A	sorry I interrupt
B	in this in this thing I was gonna say we went up to London in this thing and we parked in the underground car park I can't remember where that was it wasn't Marble Arch I don't think so we were going along and all of a sudden we'd zoomed down this underground car park erm I can't think where it was now and erm we went and had lunch in Harrods cos he was going to order a suit
A	mm
B	and had a look round Harrods
A	mm I did exactly the same thing in London because I went down to London with
B	yes
A	and
B	yes
A	and that's just off Oxford Street or somewhere like that
B	yes
A	well presumably somewhere in the centre
B	well I could have been Park Lane this underground car park
A	mm
B	we were going along and all of a sudden
A	yeah
B	where are we going?
A	and you're out busy in Oxford Street or Regent Street or something
B	yes
A	and then suddenly you end up in in at underground in a car park on a day when the car park was mostly empty because you know the workers weren't using it
B	oh it was his works car park?
A	yeah yes he
B	yeah
A	it was a
B	yeah
A	where he worked
B	ah
A	I guess he must have driven down every day to have access to it
B	yes
A	erm
B	I I know
A	mm
B	that had an underground car park cos he's he
A	mm mm mm
B	thing cos he said I wouldn't have been able to I wouldn't have erm been
A	mm
B	but he he didn't go very
A	well yes yes
B	downstairs as it were yeah
A	and
B	yeah
A	and
B	yes
A	I suppose
B	mm
A	gosh that was a long time ago was it
B	yes I remember
A	I mean they probably don't do the same thing now with parking because otherwise you'd have to go through the congestion charge every day probably wouldn't you?
B	yeah I suppose so unless was he a government department? have they got
A	no no no
B	some special
B	oh
A	he worked on patents
B	I don't know
A	it's er it's
B	right oh
A	yeah shall we erm have a will if you've got time shall we have a look at the beginning of the Sewing Bee? cos
B	we could do
A	we didn't see all of it yesterday
B	mm
A	shall we
B	we could do that yes I haven't actually heard back from my friend erm
A	mm
B	be interesting to hear what she thought about it
A	yes perhaps it doesn't appeal to sewers I don't know
B	I don't know
A	it's quite good spectator sport and I found on the early ones erm they seemed a bit more informative I think it was having that person who was more of a teacher as the other judge
B	yes
A	cos I'm sure I sort of learnt things or thought about things
B	mm
A	whereas I don't really get the same I don't enjoy that new judge the
B	mm
A	female judge
B	no
A	as much as the other lady
B	no but the man's quite funny
A	he he is he is actually coming out to be really quite a character on it
B	yes
A	he seemed a bit erm standoffish in the first series
B	yeah mind you I mean it is to some extent it is erm depends how much you know about the subject because I I I used to
A	on yes
