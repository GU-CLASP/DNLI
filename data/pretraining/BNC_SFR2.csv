B	no I've never been I I'd like to it's on my list of places to go
A	yeah it's amazing
B	to be fair though I've only been to
B	I should probably like travel a little bit
A	it's so cheap it's the cheapest place ever
B	is it?
A	yeah
B	okay
A	erm and really pretty
B	I'll have to give it a go yeah yeah and I this year I made a list of holidays in January that I thought would be good for this year and I've had loads of amazing holidays but it's not the same as the list of holidays
B	so I think next year I'm gonna try and tick some off
A	stick to your
B	erm my bucket list is I really want to go to
A	yeah
B	so I wanna wanna go to
A	where about where just anywhere in particular or?
B	I think I mean
A	mm
B	and seeing some more remote stuff erm it just seems like a nice part of the world really
A	I've only been there for erm an afternoon because we we were we were staying in this village in
B	okay alright
A	in that I think I showed you a picture of that
B	oh no you did yeah
A	yeah
B	oh amazing yeah
A	so we stayed there in the woods in
B	right
A	we had to like drive down for four hours
B	right
A	and then we caught a boat across from so we drove down to
B	yeah
A	caught and then got a boat out
B	ah I've got you ah I see
A	yeah so we were in
B	nice
A	yeah
B	yeah I was in
A	oh yeah
B	over the bridge to
A	to
B	yeah really nice like it was another day out erm but I think I'd like to
A	yeah
B	go a bit further on
A	so what else
B	erm so what else? erm I want to go to
A	nice
B	cos the the Spanish is in there it's it's it's sort of dormant and I need to give it a kick and
A	where what city would you choose?
B	I don't know it that's as far as the plans go
A	yeah
B	erm I've been to
A	yeah you pick pick somewhere that's got a good accent
B	ah that's a good idea
A	erm maybe maybe
B	yeah okay
A	but if you want the sea then
B	well I'm not fussed I'm I'm
A	no
B	thinking about doing you know going studying and being very serious about it
A	like
B	yeah
A	suggestions yeah I've never been actually so I've no idea
B	I've never been to
A	yeah
B	so that I've got kind of a list of reminders of stuff that I wanna do erm skiing that's the other thing I wanna go skiing somewhere cold in the winter
A	yeah I love skiing
B	maybe in like early in the year next year I think I've only been to
A	is that
A	yeah I've been up there
B	it's it's good but yeah
A	yeah I
B	I would like to go abroad
B	really?
A	you'd be really shocked it's it's kind of two and a bit hours' drive
B	mm
A	but erm it's really funny cos there's just no snow but they they make a lot of fake snow there is snow but it's
B	oh I see
A	it's they kind of shovel it from the mountains so the ski area is really small
A	yeah and also it gets kind of hot so it was it was almost like twenty degrees at the bottom of the mountain
B	that's mental
A	the day that we went so it was just just really weird yeah it was really weird feeling really warm but seeing snow
B	that's surreal that's really weird
A	yeah but it was good
B	yeah maybe
A	there's erm
B	mm
A	like the north of
B	right yeah
A	I don't think being like small and a bit renegade is a reason for it to
B	yeah
A	be cheaper
B	I heard was it
A	and
B	yeah there's a few places that are apparently still quite cheap for skiing and really good
A	yeah
B	and really pretty so I'll have to give them a go
A	I'd love to go
B	better than well oh yeah the last skiing I did was
A	we had it cos like we went once when I was younger and like so that we'd we'd have been skiing once before
B	yeah
A	there's a dry ski slope near my near my house in
B	yeah
A	have you been on them?
B	there's one in
A	yeah and it's they have like massive gaps so I was always really worried that my ski would like get caught in the gap
B	yeah you
A	and just end up and it was kind of like oops down and then you'd have to like walk back up cos there was no lift
B	oh right
A	and I think it was like
B	that puts me off
A	yeah it was just the weirdest thing
B	yeah and just falling over as well does it not hurt when you fall over onto it cos it's not
A	I think I was too scared to to really
B	fair enough
A	and it was on the army barracks so
B	ah I was gonna ask where where where the ski slope was in
A	yeah so yeah
B	yeah that's kind of random
A	weird
B	there's a big one in
A	in erm
B	mm
A	you can erm you can see the ski jump from whenever the
B	oh
A	Olympics were there
B	oh cool
A	yeah I would never ever in my life do that but
B	yeah no
A	it's quite cool to see
B	yeah see other people doing it yeah
A	the ski jump yeah
B	that's pretty cool
A	but yeah no it's quite cool
B	mm
A	but I'm no expert skier and I love but I love it just being in the mountains and like
B	yeah just I thought it was quite a fun way of having an active holiday but not feeling like you were trekking everywhere or having to do like anything particularly strenuous it just felt
A	really good
B	quite nice yeah
A	yeah
B	but what's so what's on your like bucket list of of holidays for next year?
A	erm I really want to go to
B	it's really good
A	yeah and I went I remember I went when I did my GCSEs
B	ah great
A	and I was like mum I've got to be at home studying and she was like no it's fine and I remember
B	amazing
A	I remember doing my maths coursework in
B	yes
A	enjoy it
B	and not do coursework
A	and not yeah not being taken away by my irresponsible mother erm and I'd absolutely love to go to
B	mm
A	it's been on my list for a while now
B	yeah
A	erm but it's it's a big trip and I don't wanna go for just two I dunno it's a bit of a difficult one to to plan and
B	yeah
A	but I really wanna go to
B	that would be amazing yeah mm
A	yeah
B	yeah that would be nice
A	and then just obviously a million trips around Europe
B	yeah that's the thing cos like Europe is so easy to get to
A	yeah especially having
B	you can
A	Stansted here
B	so good and I'd never fly from anywhere else now it's just so easy
A	no
B	erm and you can get around it's not
A	yeah
B	it's not a small airport like you can
A	yeah it's really good
B	it's really good yeah erm
A	but erm
B	really nice
A	yeah I know and I just wanna I dunno cos like this summer I went to
B	oh right oh cool
A	and it was just really nice going somewhere cos I the last obviously the last few years I just I've just been like
B	yeah
A	and it's been lovely but it's quite nice to one of my reasons for leaving
B	okay
A	like in my holidays all I did was come back to England and then you know?
B	yeah less to
A	yeah
A	and I would
B	I've never been to
A	you have to be a millionaire
B	yep
A	yeah it's just funny after a while and you're like five pound for that cup of tea yeah
B	cool
A	no problem
B	there you go
A	yeah
B	yeah you
A	yeah
B	yeah yeah there's like it goes the opposite way as well and I think when stuff's really cheap you learn what stuff should cost and then you're like eighty pence what?
A	what for a meal?
B	yeah
A	you're having a laugh
B	and
A	yeah
B	really kind of small amounts of money
A	it's just like it really doesn't matter
B	it's really funny do you find like when you go to places that aren't
A	completely and also
B	yeah
A	I kind of it kicks into this thing that you just know what's happening and you can just
B	mm
A	you can tell everyone what you want to tell people and you're like er no er I see you can't speak you can't speak this language
B	yeah
A	and and then it just comes out in Spanish
B	yeah I went to
A	yeah it's really embarrassing
B	yeah
A	because you're like I do know I know I'm in
B	yeah it's just I think it's that must be
A	yeah
B	kicks like around the language
A	yeah
B	as their kind of language for this country
A	I used to dream in a lot in Spanish
B	oh that's interesting
A	yeah
B	I've
A	yeah
B	you've kind of made it
A	you've done it
B	oh okay
A	dream in and cos I sleep talk as well and
B	oh nice
A	and
B	that is very cool
A	I was like was it grammatically good?
B	exactly yeah
A	yeah what was I chatting about?
B	that's pretty good
A	yeah
B	the other thing my driving instructor when I first learnt to drive said when you dream that you're driving that's
A	oh really?
B	that's when yeah apparently that's like it's a thing that you're sort of comfortable with it and you
A	I've never dreamt that and I don't think I'll ever be comfortable driving
B	yeah I've still never dreamt driving I don't think I don't remember dreaming I'm driving
A	I was really scared cos erm I have a car here and obviously recently I just haven't been out in it cos I'm just working really hard on my master's
B	yeah
A	and on the road that it's parked it's not my road because I have to pay
B	mm
A	and the next road is is a free one
B	right
A	so I sneakily park it there and erm yeah and they were doing roadworks the other day and they'd like blocked off a whole bit and they luckily like they didn't get my car cos it said they'd blocked the whole bit and
B	right
A	I hadn't looked at the car for two weeks
B	yeah
A	so then yesterday I was like oh what happens you know for another two weeks?
B	oh
A	and I was really worried they might have
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	moved the
A	but it was fine
B	oh good
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah like when you're not doing your dissertation do you find you'd like drive quite a lot or?
A	erm not massively but I love having the car cos it's a kind of like way of
B	definitely
A	escape and it's a really nice car to drive so I really enjoy it it's my grandma's old car
B	oh brilliant
A	it's a really old one
B	nice
A	so I love having it but and just having it to like bomb around in
B	yeah
A	to go out and do things so yeah I guess maybe like once a week I use it
B	yeah
A	but erm I don't know if it's really financially worth it
B	yeah cos I like I love driving and I don't have a car so I hire one if I'm doing like a big trip
A	yeah
B	but I don't have one for like
A	yeah
B	I sometimes think if I've got to buy some tins or something I just think oh I wish I could just drive to Tesco's and and do it
A	get it
B	but like it's sort of just the initial kind of
A	yeah
B	it's just like if my dad was giving away his car I would
A	you would go for it
B	yeah I would I would take it but
A	they have this really good thing in
B	oh
A	how much I love
B	mm
A	there's certain centres around the sea and you you borrow a car it's a bit like the Boris bikes
B	oh right
A	with cars and they're electric so you plug them in to these and they're normally in kind of if there's a block of flats
B	uhu
A	and there's a erm a garage at the bottom like that's where he picked it up from and he was able to like pick us up take us to the airport
B	that's really cool
A	so you everyone and you kind of have an agreement and it works
B	mm
A	and no one abuses it and it's you know it's all like if you I guess if you've crashed it even I don't know
B	yeah
A	the insurance or whatever I'm sure it's all sorted but you have access to a car and it's a green one and
B	that would be so good
A	yeah and
B	I wish we had that
A	and also it would it would someone like me who doesn't use the car that much
B	mm
A	it would be great and like the car doesn't go that fast so I don't think you could take it too far out of the city so you couldn't take it to like
B	yeah
B	but that would be nice just
A	but it would be just to pop like to pop around and
B	yeah and like you said if you need to pick someone up or
A	yeah
B	cos there's been a couple of times when I've thought mm I could I could justify it for this week but just not for next week you know?
A	yeah
B	just
A	yeah it's such
A	a good scheme
B	yeah we should do something like that mm
A	yeah cos I was thinking it's a shame that my car is sitting there and it would be lovely to like be able to
B	yeah
A	have the car insured rather than me and then everyone
B	yeah
A	that I say drives it can drive it and it would be a really good solution because it's a shame
B	yeah it's a stupid system insuring the driver on the car
A	yeah
B	it's ridiculous
A	yeah
B	it really annoys me
A	yeah cos in
B	yeah cos you're you're a driver and you're insured and then
A	yeah and the car yeah
B	and the car's insured for whoever drives it like
A	yeah it's what it makes sense yeah
B	it makes a lot more sense
A	but that's what it always used to be like in England I think
B	really?
A	not that I know cos
B	back in the day
A	back in the day when I was a teenager so I don't know
B	ah
A	but yeah
B	it's a shame
A	yeah I know it's a right shame but yeah
B	wow we've done fifteen minutes
A	shall we stop?
B	yeah
