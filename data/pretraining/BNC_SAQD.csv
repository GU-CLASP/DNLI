A	really?
D	they send it to you via email you click on it
B	oh
D	and you have an account to get in and see it
A	yeah
D	so it's all done electronically and you
B	oh
D	cut down their paper and you you've got it basically
A	oh
D	which is
A	yeah
D	as long as it's C and above not a problem
A	oh
D	and she got threes in that
A	oh right
D	and
A	oh yeah
D	et cetera
A	yeah
C	mm
D	so I thought okay and she'd got a three in this one column for and when you read the description it says
A	yeah
D	but to have that down as a three
A	yeah
D	so did speak to
D	no it's not like Ofsted criteria at all
A	yeah
D	book or you're not enthusiastic enough
A	yeah
D	over the moon with
A	is she?
D	really pleased with what she's doing even in that short period of six seven weeks she has moved a long way with what she's doing
A	great
B	mm
D	so they were really pleased over the time just says she needs to talk a little bit more and have that bit of confidence but that's not
A	no it's not no
D	she won't say things that unless she really has to
D	so then
A	unlike
D	yeah unlike
D	and I ah I thought you were supposed to be telling me what
D	some questions about it oh
D	the teacher this woman goes oh like this
C	I'd be so
A	intimidated
D	intimate
C	by you I'd be like oh no
D	so it was like
C	don't hurt me
D	so it was like oh and she'd got the a piece of work in front of her from
A	yeah
D	the taking one part of the health and
A	yeah yeah
D	but you don't do anything
C	yeah
A	that's right
D	you've got to get back into that routine of working the level is different I said
D	about what's required and what isn't required and
B	mm
D	stuff and of course as soon as you do that it's like no we we work together we we do all the bits and pieces
A	yeah
D	no you don't sorry
A	yeah
D	and I'm I'm going from experience cos I've seen it
A	yeah
D	so many times
A	yeah
D	I said so she didn't
D	so there's taking out got this week add half term I said and two weeks to get them out and ready for half term so all the stuff could be collated so I'm I'm working round about four weeks ago
B	yeah round about four weeks ago
D	I said if like four away from the seven that's only three three weeks into her starting the course et cetera I says and therefore it fits in that she wasn't very happy
B	mm
D	in in your in your subject with what you're doing oh well yeah
B	mm
D	and it was like mm okay and then er when I'd gone into the art cos we saw the art people first there was a member of staff that I knew
A	oh really?
D	yeah and
A	yeah
D	and I'm here with
D	she says she says why? I say it's because we employed him as an English and media studies teacher at
A	yeah
D	you know the type of thing I says and he was promised things and he didn't
A	yeah
D	er a max suite and things well
A	yeah
D	so he he
A	that's right yeah
D	which was pretty good sat down and he says
A	right
D	really impressed with the way that she's working and I and I I'd always thought that she might do something with er films cos she's always watched films
A	yeah
D	she's always liked things like that
B	mm
D	so that's good I said the one that does concern would be the psychology and the understanding he
A	yeah
D	so the coursework will be out of the way and then they're getting them ready for the exam in May
A	well
D	so
A	yeah
D	but I was I was I was pleased then I was

C	I get so
A	and that does annoy teachers in the
C	but it's not really when they talk it's like when you're allowed to talk but they're like
C	and I get told off for singing
B	yeah
C	like it's so boring like geography class no one speaks so I just start the conversation and the whole class can hear what I'm saying and then everyone else just speaks

C	oh
D	it's funny if you don't get if you're just a little bit out
A	yeah
D	how it makes such a difference
B	mm
A	it is yeah
C	that's like
A	why if you
C	like the er this is one of my RS religion cards
C	is that
C	the earth is in the perfect place for gravity to work therefore
A	so who would be this someone?
B	yeah
C	god
A	yeah well now now now you've gotta explain to me
B	mm
A	how did he get there in the first place?
C	because
A	I still wanna know
B	okay
A	how god got there
B	yeah
C	because
A	because
C	because he's a magical man
C	I don't know
A	oh right
B	right
D	mm
B	that sounds like philosophy to me
C	yeah it is sort of that
D	but isn't that what religion is?
B	yeah
A	yes
B	yeah
C	do you know what O M N I P O T E N T is?
D	right so what do those keywords say?
C	er?
D	can you pronounce those keywords?
C	I don't need to pronounce it cos it's not speaking it's writing so I just spelt it so
C	I'll get a mark there
D	beleveran?
A	bella belevan
D	bilevorent
A	ella
C	all loving
A	B
D	beleveren
B	yeah
D	beliveran
C	divine
D	thank you
C	godly
C	what's another one?
C	mm erm
C	a spirit
D	whisky
A	whisky
C	a vital principle within living things
A	oh right
B	ah
D	wow on that note
C	supernatural
B	yeah it's getting deep the conversation now
D	on that note
C	believe or beyond anything that's natural
D	what supernatural?
C	yeah
D	did you hear about
A	do they?
D	they reckon some research they've done research saying there is no such thing as ghosts it is your brain
A	out of your body
D	it's your brain having a moment and it's actually you
A	oh right
D	because
C	see that's why you've gotta turn it off it's because of
D	there maybe there is maybe there is a ghost erm
D	erm it was something along the lines of your brain gets confused so it sees things but it's actually seeing you
A	oh right
D	in that place beforehand
A	so how to premonitions work then?
B	but not someone else's ghost it was you?
D	no it's actually
C	no it is you
D	it's actually you
B	mm
C	but it doesn't look like you it's like someone else
D	because because your brain just
A	changes it about
D	confuses it and everything
B	mm
D	which is interesting
A	that's because
D	yeah
A	we actually see things upside down
C	so you
A	I don't know how it would work when you stand on your head though
B	hard to imagine innit?
A	it is hard
D	it is hard isn't it when you think of it
A	yeah
C	I hate when like my RS teacher he asks really weird questions what really makes you think and it really freaks me out sometimes
A	you don't like philosophy?
C	it freaks me out like
A	well some people think
B	wow
A	that we
C	mm
A	and you there would think totally different like the bad you
C	mm
A	and that's what they call the parallel universe so you've got you've got a you that want that is really what you
C	yeah
D	so when you're being bad you're being good in the other parallel universe
A	that's right yes
D	and when you're being good here you're bad in the other so you're always good
A	yeah
B	oh
D	right then on that note
A	that was very deep
B	yeah yes
D	we're always good
B	very good
A	yeah
