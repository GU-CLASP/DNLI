A	they really seemed to enjoy it er
B	they were a nice couple I thought she'd
A	yeah
B	plenty about her hadn't she?
A	yeah
B	she was a lively
A	I think er bubbly is the word
B	bubbly yeah
A	people might
B	yeah
A	describe
B	yeah yeah
A	yeah
B	I watched her face at the end and she was like
B	yeah
B	yeah that's what I think we made a genuine contribution
A	yeah
B	to the night
A	yes and er I don't think we've ever done an event where people haven't
B	no
A	no
B	no and I think
A	there's the Costcutter that I went to
B	oh right
A	yeah
B	your scram from?
A	oh there's a Lidl just up there as well we could have gone to
B	yeah I think this is the way we should have come in really but I just
A	yeah
B	it was good wasn't it?
A	yeah
B	I just er you know we might get some more
A	yeah well there was
B	gigs out of there
A	that man who came up to us wasn't there?
B	he was a toast man wasn't he?
A	was he?
B	yeah
A	but in a different guise
B	in yeah he'd er slipped
A	oh if I'd known that
B	into something more comfortable
A	I'd have given him a few more
B	yeah
A	oh cos he
B	funny I didn't recognise him
A	he recommends
B	I I only by only because
A	yeah it's
A	it's cos he recommends us he you know what I mean? he all of his clients he can recommend band and things
B	yeah yeah
A	no he didn't a man did give me his card and it was I can't read it in the dark
B	oh yeah well that's alright isn't it?
A	but it's someone who claims to do bow rehairs or something oh yeah that's not fair
B	yeah
A	there were so many
B	this is just quite an old part of
A	yeah
B	sheds and stuff
A	yeah
B	oh very much so
A	would it almost feel like you're in you weren't connected if you were in one and the other?
B	well they no they were really quite separate cities
A	yeah
B	really they
A	yeah
B	grew up independently of each other really
A	they just happened to be very close to each other
B	yeah
A	like Newcastle and Gateshead
B	yes
A	to name
B	yeah
A	but one
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah they're they're lucky cos they've got a river in between
A	you know it is a
B	really?
A	city encompasses a lot of the countryside where the thing where whereas things like er the city of London is only a square mile really
B	yeah
A	isn't it?
B	well the
A	yeah
B	the city is just a square mile
A	yeah
B	of London yeah
A	yeah and then there's the city of
B	yeah
A	Westminster as well which is actually bigger
B	I've had a few curries round here
A	I bet you have have they
B	well where I used to live in
A	yeah? and have your have they all been good or have you had a few ones that have been memorable for the wrong reasons?
B	I don't think I've ever had a really bad one no
A	oh
B	yeah
A	the inner ring
B	yeah
A	road now the the sort of traditional houses interspersed with small shops the odd restaurant
B	yes I know what you mean yeah yeah it is a bit isn't it?
A	yeah
B	except that this is hilly
A	yeah
B	you know you're you're going all the way down to the River
A	yeah yeah
B	moving continually down to the
A	that's a good way if you're ever stuck in a city and you don't know where to get to
B	if you know the river
A	walk downhill
B	yeah
A	and you'll end up at the river yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	it definitely overran didn't it?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	of time it takes to feed people they say
A	yeah
B	okay right well we'll have our meal between you know half past six and half past eight but you know it takes thirty minutes to get everybody's first course out
B	well yeah that's an exaggeration but it it takes a long time
A	it does yeah it takes a long time
B	and then they've got to eat it then it's got to be cleared away
A	and the next one's got to be
B	and then the next one's got to be brought out it takes a long time to feed a lot of people
A	yeah well
B	when you know we see it again and again and again
A	yeah
A	oh yeah?
A	oh oh
B	this is the way I
A	oh I see
B	traffic lights but anyway a little trip down memory lane
A	see that's really nice that view there
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	a few weeks back and the view that's on a cliff
B	and it the view over
A	yeah
B	the river
B	from here yeah
A	yeah oh cos that's the one in
B	yes it flows
A	yeah
B	through the two and the the canal follows
A	yeah
B	er that route out
B	and the railway follows that route out because the river takes the flattest
B	route
A	yeah
B	and when the canals were built if you have to put locks in it's expensive and it's time consuming
A	yeah
B	so you follow the flattest route with a canal
A	yeah
B	and when the railways were built
A	yeah
B	especially with the engines at that time they couldn't pull a train up a big hill or you needed two engines
A	yeah
B	to do it so they followed the flattest route as well so if you were to
A	yeah
B	look down from about two hundred feet up when you come down here you'd see the canal the river and the railway all parallel
A	yeah yeah
B	or into
A	oh yeah
B	that way but not through the centre of
A	yeah
B	not through the centre of
A	yeah
B	you know
A	yes
B	whereas
A	oh I see
B	it's not on the river
A	that mm
B	that used to be a
A	that
B	used to be a chippy there that stayed open
A	oh yeah?
B	on Sundays
A	that about the river cos probably would mean that
B	yeah I think it was actually
A	yeah in fact that reminds me
B	is there?
A	compared to er yeah places like
B	are they really?
A	and it's the oldest one in the
B	uhu
A	definitely the oldest one in Britain and I think otherwise unlikely there's anything bigger in like Brittany or somewhere
B	yeah yeah the Celtic yeah
A	or wherever else the Celtic language spread
A	mm
B	oh that's er that's good stuff I like my history you know I like
B	history that relates
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	do you know what I mean? yeah
B	down there I used to go to my mooring
A	yeah
B	when I lived on the boat
A	oh
B	god it was dark at night
A	would they
A	yeah
B	onto the wrong one no I think there was just
A	yeah
B	and you were right on the edge of the woods there
A	yeah
B	do you have a key to get in?
A	I know I know where there is one erm
B	it's just if if we get there
A	yeah
B	first they might beat us
A	yeah I can go round and let
B	they beat us here so
A	yeah if they beat us there then they can open up and everything if we get there first then I can I can get in and er
B	you know how it's done
B	gosh it's nice to be finishing at civilised time okay
A	yeah
B	it'll be eleven o'clock when we get home but
A	it's better than starting at like
B	that's that's just that's er yeah better than going on for the last set at eleven o'clock
A	yeah welcome to
B	yeah?
A	so when you play
B	usually two sets so we'd typically go on sometime between nine and ten
A	yeah
B	depending erm
A	do you have like a set opening that you start with?
B	yeah usually erm it it we've changed it a bit over the years I can't remember what I can't remember what the current one is because oh yeah we went for erm
B	oh I can't remember
A	yeah
B	er what's it? tight harmony group Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons
A	yeah?
B	erm
A	yeah
B	I think and we used to do erm
A	yeah
B	our opener erm what was it called? tonight's
A	the Black Eyed Peas
B	that's it erm we do that erm just build it slowly then it just starts out with the guitar then the guitar and the keys then bass and one singer and then the drums and the other singer and then it just goes round a couple of times then it stops then we do Moves like Jagger and that was the best opener we've ever done you know the most successful one
A	yeah
B	have a break and depending you know if we start at like nine o'clock we come off quarter to ten again
A	yeah
B	something like that start again at quarter past ten play till eleven eleven fifteen but that's that's an ideal night very often it just gets pushed back and back and back and back
A	yeah
B	so you're going on for the last one around eleven o'clock so sometimes you'll play forty-five minutes come off for five minutes
A	yeah
B	just time for people to go to the toilet or whatever then get back on and do the second set
A	yeah
B	so the first set you're usually around forty-five minutes and the second set around an hour and if if they're keen if they want encores it's a little bit longer but it just
A	yeah
B	just depends on the night sometimes they're absolutely going mad and they don't want you to get off under any circumstances
B	and sometimes say right thanks that's the last number you've played the last number and that's it you pack up and go home
B	it is
A	must be good yeah
B	oh it's it's great it's great I wouldn't erm I wouldn't swap it it's erm
A	yeah
B	you know you're playing you're playing stuff you like generally speaking that you've had er some hand in choosing and alright
A	yeah
B	there'll be pieces that you're not particularly keen on there'll be pieces that you really enjoy playing
A	yeah
B	or you find a technical challenge
A	yeah
B	or you particularly enjoy them
A	yeah
B	erm and you're playing it with your pals
A	yeah
B	which you know which is a large part of our band really
A	yeah you've gotta be playing with people who you like playing with
B	yeah yeah I mean a lot of bands they
B	and you turn up and you play and you go home again and there's nothing more to it than that
A	is that famous?
B	it is it set itself up as a erm a rival to Harry Ramsden's but
A	really?
B	they're nothing special there's a chippy opposite called
A	yeah
B	and that's a really nice chippy I would always choose to go to the
A	yeah
B	partly the people who you're with and it's a bit of social for us
A	yeah
B	but the you know the payoff is people enjoying it the payoff is people getting up
B	and dancing and erm just having a good time
A	yeah
B	oh yeah yeah yeah we do we have a set it's changes from gig to gig
A	yeah
B	so
A	yeah
B	or maybe that one mm maybe we played it a bit early last time so we'll put it a bit later in the set so we we we shift stuff about but so over time it changes I mean there's some we've been playing ever since we started the
A	yeah
B	there's a Chuck Berry one that we do
A	yeah
B	you know your mum's got to get them on the floor then she's got to get them sorted out then she's got to teach the steps
A	they just do it don't they?
B	we we stop one right thanks very much now the next song is one of your favourites and we're in
A	yeah
B	and that so you you know you need the order to be a set order
A	yeah
B	that you all know and that you all stick to cos again you know when it's in a what can be an extremely noisy environment plus the fact that with ear
A	yeah
B	monitoring you can't hear anything that isn't coming through the back through the PA system
B	so it can be a bit erm you know if you say to somebody on the other side of the stage we're skipping this one and we're doing so and so and so and so the odds are they're not gonna hear and they'll just start playing the one that's on the list so
B	six
A	six you er drum
B	yeah
A	lead guitar
B	keys
A	keys and the
B	and the two girls
A	two girls yeah
B	oh
A	wow brilliant
B	and we we're at the minute we're going through a process of weeding some out you know stuff that think oh right it's never we've played it a couple of times what we'll try and do is is play one or two each one that are hot in the charts at the time
A	I see yeah
B	so we played a Meghan Trainor one
A	yeah All About that Bass was it?
B	er it it wasn't unfortunately
A	oh right
B	and then erm
A	she was she was famous for
B	yeah
A	it sort of fizzles out a bit
B	yeah I I I
A	yeah
B	gone the way of a lot of similar people
A	it's like that er there's a few like er a few years ago there was a fella who called himself Passenger and he released a song and it got to number one and it was there for weeks people loved it and singing it and they kept asking him to do it and he didn't release anything else and ever since I imagine he's still doing
B	that song
A	tours and things
A	yeah
B	oh well that must well it's funny isn't it? you know the the the
A	yeah well he was yeah
B	so we er you know we we'll do a song like that for a bit and if it's a really good song and people love it we'll keep it if it's just one of those throw away ones or if it doesn't work you know sometimes you put quite a lot of work into actually working up a song only to find that you play it a couple of times at a gig and it just doesn't seem to come off
A	yeah
B	really all that well
A	yeah
B	er I don't think we're doing anything that's terribly current erm
A	when's your next gig?
B	we're doing erm
A	oh yeah?
B	erm
B	but
A	are you playing soon somewhere or have you got a rest?
B	sorry?
A	have you got a rest before the next gig or is it
B	erm
A	quite soon?
B	the next one is
A	yeah
B	and that's erm that's in October
A	yeah
B	and that it that's usually a good a good one cos the erm
A	do they?
B	yeah
A	yeah when's that?
B	I forget which date in October it is it might be the tenth
A	do you get about one a month say?
B	it it it averages that yeah it averages that it's funny we started this year with lots in prospect
A	yeah
B	oh yeah we think we've got this and somebody's been interested in that and and then half of them just haven't come off
A	yeah that's what I found with
B	yeah people make enquiries and yeah yeah
A	they think it's a nice idea
B	and they're keen and
A	but
B	yeah yeah
A	they never wanna commit yeah
B	but we've got two in erm
B	bar and bistro out on the A59 called
B	been a a restaurant type place for a long long time and we've done a few gigs there and
A	yeah
B	Christmas parties where people you know he charges X amount per head he'll put on a meal put on a band and then he'll put on the bar and erm he
A	yeah
B	so we're doing I think the sixth and the nineteenth
A	yeah?
B	and they they they
A	yeah
B	and yeah when well we get fed by
A	brilliant
B	yeah
A	yeah
A	but
A	yeah
B	right in the middle of the room and you've you've either we either go out through one particular door but then we've got to walk the length of the place outside which if it's cold and wet and rainy it isn't much fun
B	or we can get out another door which is closer to where we've put the vehicles but you're picking your way through the tables and people at the tables and people still
A	yeah
B	is er so that's the only drawback though and it's we you know and we like playing there so that's a couple of
A	yeah brilliant
B	we
A	yeah
B	and we pay our sound man two fifty and he does the sound and he does really good lights as well
A	yeah
B	erm
A	and then there's a grand to share between the rest of you
B	and then there's a grand to share between the rest of us so we normally take a hundred and fifty out of it each
A	yeah
B	something like that and then put the rest into the band fund
A	yeah
B	and that you know that'll pay for erm pay for bits of gear sometimes if we invest in gear er it'll pay for that or it'll you know it goes for the insurance we buy our beer for rehearsals cos we always have
A	yeah
B	a couple of beers at rehearsals
A	yeah
B	so it pays for that
A	yeah
B	other odds and sods there's like insurance and what have you
A	yeah I suppose with there being a lot more of you it's more expensive than a
B	yeah yeah
A	plus the caller
B	yeah we're we're fairly economical see I mean we can
A	yeah yeah
B	we can turn out for four hundred quid and it's it's a a good wage isn't it?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	don't they?
B	I
A	yeah
B	that we should be up around the six or seven hundred
A	yeah
B	mark for a wedding
A	well today we got eight didn't we?
B	yeah
A	definitely yeah that's it with a wedding you're at their
B	yeah
A	beck and call you're standing around
B	that's right
A	all day
B	yeah you you're there
A	yeah
B	all day so we have
A	yeah
B	in fact been working
A	yeah
B	all day
A	yeah and then of course
B	who's this clown?
A	charities er we give them the discount as well
B	sorry
B	oh yeah yeah I don't
A	yeah
B	I don't mind doing that at all
A	definitely no yeah
B	I don't mind it
A	and do they give you the
B	we we do the same with the directors we cut you know we
A	yeah
B	we ask
A	yeah
B	if it's a charity do
A	yeah
B	you know if if it's
A	yeah
B	put on dos er you know people who have lost relatives
A	oh right yeah
B	erm you know they'll they'll have a a do to raise funds for
A	yeah yeah
B	you know Macmillan or something like that so if it's a private do like that erm
A	that twelve fifty must be like in cash it must be a lot of money to be carrying around
B	yeah
A	but
B	this
A	they can't just give you it in an envelope surely it must come in
B	oh yeah yeah
A	do they?
B	yeah yeah
A	and do you deal with it on the night dish it out
B	the yeah
A	or do you dish it out
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	dish it out
A	yeah
B	on the night
A	yeah
B	I mean they occasionally we don't get paid until later we did erm we did one and we charged money for it for erm
A	yeah
B	it was the Friday before the bike race and it oh it was a cold wet bloody miserable night
A	yeah
B	erm and I had to remind him a couple of times to come and pay us
B	and they divvied up and that was a that was a wad of cash that might have been
A	yeah
A	fifteen hundred in cash
A	cor
B	we
A	yeah
B	you know we don't want the taxman on us
B	yeah
A	then we had five nights and five consecutive nights and on the last night all of us there must have been about twenty-five of us all had the little
B	yeah
A	envelope of I think it was almost three hundred quid for the for our services
B	very nice
A	three hundred quid on the
B	very nice
A	and that was
B	yeah several grand isn't it?
A	you can the a lot of cash sitting around yeah so
B	the yeah absolutely
A	yeah yeah
B	yeah
A	still
B	two
A	yeah
B	it
A	yeah
B	erm which erm
A	oh yeah
B	he's he's he's not a bass player really he's a guitar player and he's a good guitar player incidentally
A	yeah
B	doesn't really like playing bass very much
B	just says it's just physically such hard work
A	yeah
B	but it it it's you know he'll sit in to oblige you know he's he's got he's a nice lad erm so occasionally we have a dep drummer or a dep keys man
A	yeah
B	and what we say we'll pay you whatever it is a hundred quid or two hundred quid or whatever it is erm for one rehearsal or two rehearsals and the gig you know like an
A	yeah
B	all-in fee for the whole thing
A	oh I see yeah
B	erm just contacts we know really erm I don't
A	yeah
B	I mean it's erm
A	yeah
B	and he did a Halloween gig up up at
A	yeah
B	I think yeah and er he was a
A	yes
B	in hotels
A	I've been tempted to do that sometimes
B	yeah I
B	in the slightest because nobody's really listening
A	I wouldn't mind that to be honest
B	would you not?
A	no I would actually enjoy it yeah
B	I would find it soul destroying in the extreme
A	no no I was erm I went round to someone's house just these people in the village you know
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	yeah and they've got a little digital piano and I just sort of walked over to it and they were all speaking and I was playing this thing and they were saying how they'd been to a meal somewhere and they said that I was sort of sounding like what their lounge man had been like and I thought that might be quite good you just get your cash for the night there's no pressure at all
B	yeah
A	just a bit of fun to try a bit of jazz maybe try a bit of just a
B	yeah I well I wouldn't erm I you know I wouldn't say a thing against it I mean this guy was making his living doing it
A	yeah
B	erm it
A	it can be quite lucrative
B	it it it was you know I think he was quite well paid it I think he just found it a bit no I mean he wasn't really complaining
A	yeah
B	he just found it a bit lonely in a way cos you turn up you play it
A	yeah
B	you you know
A	I couldn't do it as a as a job
B	you you you don't it is a job yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	I wouldn't want it as a job I I would see it as just sort of like something I would do
B	yeah
A	in my part time
B	well the sort of thing you could throw in literally couldn't you and just just to earn an extra few quid every now and again
A	yeah
B	you'd probably do it when you're at uni
A	yeah yeah
B	yeah
A	if I find myself at a loose hen loose end one summer
B	yes
A	some of those
B	yeah
A	venues will have really nice er Steinways or er there's that new Italian company that makes grand pianos that are really really nice
B	oh really?
A	a lot better yeah begins with an F er Fazioli that's it
B	right oh I've never heard of this yeah
A	if you ever get the chance to even see a Fazioli piano leap at it they're handmade
B	it's the business
A	in Milan they've got a
B	how much?
A	eighty thousand
B	crikey
A	and er at
A	when I was there they in their sort of secondary auditorium they've got a Fazioli piano
B	did you play it?
A	I didn't get a chance exactly but I
B	wow wow that's something isn't it?
A	they've got this erm I think a lot of a lot of it's in the brand though the their logo is just sort of contemporary Fazioli do you know what I mean? it if if you saw it you'd know what I mean the sort of
B	oh right
A	yeah
B	right but it's not their piano?
A	yeah Fazioli can do a similar thing but I think it's if you are a venue you can become a Fazioli venue
B	yeah
A	and then you can use it
B	well it erm you'd crane it up wouldn't you and take it in through the er French windows
A	oh
B	you're rich enough to afford
A	yeah
B	the crane lift
B	to get it up there
A	yeah having said that I was looking on Ebay and there's a few going they're probably not much good at all a hundred quid hundred and fifty quid you know
B	oh for a normal piano?
A	no for a grand
B	really?
A	believe it or not yeah baby grands going for a hundred and fifty quid
B	good grief
A	and that erm that's buy it nows as well or sort of like on the last day of bidding it's not just an opening price they probably sound terrible and all out of tune and probably missing a a few keys
B	course you can't
A	well
B	selling a decent instrument for that little
A	no it'll be
B	you know
A	people who have died and their children
B	yeah
A	just wanting rid of it I imagine
B	maybe so yeah I mean battered old uprights
A	oh
B	you know you've got to pay to get rid of them
A	yeah
B	haven't you? but
A	yeah yeah
B	have you?
A	asked where we definitely came back from a gig this way cos I saw that branch of
B	oh
A	might it be somewhere else maybe?
B	oh
A	cos I I've never
A	driven down here before other than for gigs whenever I come to
B	oh well I don't know way I I can't recall
A	it says
B	do we
A	no?
B	no
A	no
B	what
A	yeah I don't know why I said that even
A	that was a crazy
A	crazy thing at twenty-five to eleven
B	are you sure it's not another
A	no it was definitely that one
B	oh right
A	might I have been to
B	ah you might have been yes
A	right
B	yeah
A	that's answered
B	yeah
A	my question
B	yeah
A	I've definitely driven past that
B	oh right
A	it's
B	yeah you you
A	yeah
B	yeah yeah it'll be when you've been to
A	fireworks going off there
B	oh I thought I saw a flash somewhere
A	yeah I thought it
B	yeah
A	was just driving past the hedge
B	yeah I know
A	that might be to do with the devolution
B	oh
B	they
A	so they're having a big fight about it in
B	they'll be celebrating Jeremy Corbyn's
A	yeah
B	victory maybe
A	I think it's
B	or
A	more likely to be the
B	north
B	isn't it?
A	save for
B	yeah yeah
A	there's not a single Labour councillor on the
B	yeah I
B	oh really?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	it was I don't know if I told you but I was having a look at the when I was working for the
B	the health statistics?
A	and the biggest problem in
B	oh
A	Mediterranean which leads to that
B	well yeah I
A	it's abnormally high in
B	really?
A	yeah
B	well that's erm I mean that's a reasonable explanation isn't it?
A	yeah
B	erm they or may not be the er correct one
A	yeah
B	people under twenty-one?
A	children breaking limbs breaking arms
B	oh right
A	sort of thing
B	yeah
A	a lot of broken wrists
B	well that does sound like sports injuries doesn't it? or the classic
A	yeah
B	broken wrist one is slipping in the winter isn't it?
A	yeah
B	to
A	which is where poverty is as well in the county and where different demographics are
A	yeah yeah
B	Scarborough's by far the poorest er district
B	is it?
A	yeah
B	and I wouldn't have thought so really for Scarborough
A	no but it includes
B	yeah I'm surprised
A	Scarborough Whitby and that sort of fringe coast
B	oh
A	Scarborough
B	mm
A	oh that's right and then Richmondshire was a lot of the military they were saying is sort of the characteristic and a lot of the health problems are associated with that because you've got Catterick garrison and a lot of those
B	yeah
A	in
B	yeah
A	Richmond
B	I thought you'd have a lot of psychiatric problems
A	yes yeah
B	yeah
A	trauma and things
B	yeah
A	it's interesting he printed off for me the this sort of dossier
A	forty pages
A	all about but that's how er bad the IT services are there I arrived on the Monday and on Wednesday afternoon I got my log-in details for the computer
B	oh
A	and er a few Saturdays after having left I could still log into my emails
B	oh really?
A	I had a dot gov dot uk email I was really proud of it was
B	you oh wow
A	dot gov dot uk
B	hey the big organisations though
A	yeah
B	they're just so slow moving
A	yeah I went to this erm
B	yeah
A	instead of computers at each desk it had a little terminal which is wire connect there's no hard drive in it it wirelessly connects to a big data centre
B	yeah yeah is that like virtual
A	yeah
B	virtual desktop?
A	they've
B	yeah
A	they've er they were all issued with these Blackberry phones when Blackberrys were in vogue
B	right
A	and now they're not they're trying to all go Microsoft across the whole county
A	so they're all being issued with this like what me and you have yeah
B	oh I
A	yeah
B	I remember this I remember this yeah er one of er the lads at work his wife worked for for the highways department
A	yeah
B	and they all got these flash phones
A	yeah
B	I
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	they chat to each other on Lync which is a Microsoft thing and the whole website is basically
B	oh right
A	and now they're getting Windows phones as well and half of them are complaining that they don't want another phone and it's not gonna be as good as the one they already have and half of them are complaining cos they don't know how how they're gonna be able to use it
A	yeah so er
B	well you certainly can't please all the people all the time
A	yeah
B	in a
A	yeah
B	like that can you?
A	yeah and then you're they're all based around Google so they've all got Google Gmail accounts they all use Google documents
B	yeah
A	Google spreadsheets
B	yeah which is a separate system isn't it?
A	yeah
B	and I
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	you download
B	for what?
A	Microsoft Word
B	yeah yeah it it is I've just bought a new laptop and they er
A	yeah
B	the basic Office suite which is only Word Excel and project I think it was on the
A	is it PowerPoint
B	with
A	maybe yeah it's a hundred quid
B	PowerPoint yeah
A	that's it the twenty thirteen one
B	yeah and
A	who
B	I
A	that that's the one that's a hundred quid
B	the latest yeah
A	at the moment yeah we got one from John Lewis and they tried to the the ticket price was a hundred and twenty-five and I said hang that
B	oh yeah
A	I think they've I think so they
B	yeah it's a standard
A	took the twenty-five off
B	it's the standard price isn't it?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	cos Apple and Microsoft they don't let you set your own prices and so what they did was they took the twenty-five quid off and sent us a voucher in the post as well as like
B	oh right
A	a gesture
B	oh that's good
A	yeah yeah but our school has just got a load of new computers this year and they're all fitted up with Microsoft 2013 Office 2013 think how much that'll cos them well I mean they'll probably get a package of some sort but still
B	yeah oh oh I'm sure they will be even so
A	oh
B	it
A	yeah
B	a big cost
A	and last year they bought us all I don't know if you've heard of Office 365 but that's like the online one for businesses they've got every student and every year seven and every staff member an account to that I never even knew I had it so I couldn't use it so they
B	oh at school?
A	yeah so
B	oh
A	believe it or not they got rid of that one it for this September they don't don't have that anymore
B	it changes so quickly doesn't it?
A	yeah
B	you know
A	they rush in and buy all the new stuff
B	yeah
A	and then
B	yeah
A	a year later they realise it was a mistake
B	it it wasn't the best stuff to get
A	yeah yeah
B	yeah
A	she likes erm loves cos was the first to get an Ipad she's got a smartwatch and everything
B	oh really?
A	the Apple Watch yeah
B	yeah?
A	the other teachers were joking they in assembly saying er have you seen Apple Watch? they were saying they
A	going round with theirs and
B	gosh so how much are they? I bet they're expensive
A	yeah I don't know how much they are
B	I've seen stuff about them and I think
A	yeah
B	I've just not won't say I'm not the slightest interest I haven't
A	no
B	I
A	yeah
B	but you know times change don't they?
A	yeah things like laptops and Iphones and things you can see
B	I once oh look
A	oh oh yeah it's close gosh things like laptops and things you can see how gradually they took over and they became more popular with people but then things like smartwatches I can't see them catching on cos people like that traditional more executive watch look as well as something that does exactly what your phone does but a lot worse and a lot smaller
B	a lot what?
A	well
B	oh yeah
A	it's a bit useless isn't it?
B	how how do you see it?
A	being that small yeah you can
B	it's bad enough
A	you can check your texts but
B	on a phone
A	you can't reply cos
B	no
A	I was reading that the new Ipads coming out come with like a stylus pen to use instead of your finger but then all these journalists were picking up that the old you know Steve Jobs he sort of invested Apple?
B	yeah
A	his rule for his life was never to include a stylus with anything so they're going mad that
B	oh
A	brought it back in again
B	no no it won't affect us it might affect that girl
A	no she's not
B	oh mind you she can go up the A19
A	yeah
B	she's going back to
A	she's from
B	so yeah yeah
A	really? that's a long way to travel
B	it is now I don't know whether she knows the couple I I think
A	oh well
B	what
A	I got an email saying that she was saying our preferred photographer can only do the twelfth of September
B	oh right well it
A	oh
B	so she was driving down
A	yeah
B	god that is absolute donkey work cos she was when you're a photographer you're just you know she never hardly ever sat down
A	yeah
B	did she?
A	yeah
B	she did actually get something to eat
A	yeah
B	at some point but
A	if I'd have been her I'd have been tempted to get the train rather than drive cos she only had one little wheelie suitcase
B	yeah
A	she maybe wouldn't have felt happy though being on a late night
B	yeah
A	train from
B	yeah that's an issue isn't it?
A	that's what I would end up personally yeah
B	and I suppose you don't know when you're gonna finish
A	yeah that's the thing yeah
B	and all all those considerations but I oh
A	personally if I was by myself I'm quite easy going within myself I'd have been happy to wait
B	yeah
A	a lot easier to drive especially from
B	I think you know if if I'd have been her I'd have tried to get a bed for the night in
A	well we saw on the way in
B	in
A	didn't we? that Ibis
B	yeah
A	hotel
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	twenty odd quid bish bash bosh get the cab out to it mind you if she's a pal she'll be doing it for nothing so
A	yeah oh right okay I see yeah
B	I don't know what a wedding photographer costs these days
A	well my RS teacher he used to do wedding videography and I saw he had on his website he had this package I think it was some something around how much we charge and he produced a video for you that's video though so I don't know
B	yeah
A	whether photography will be something similar I imagine but
B	sorry?
A	I just saw a sign to
B	yes we're not far now
A	so we must be getting home
B	we're not far
A	yeah A168 is this or are we on the A1 at the moment?
B	no we're on the 168
A	yeah
B	and we shall turn off down jolly old A19
A	yeah I
B	home to our song
A	yeah
B	no it's good I
A	I think we did
B	and it wasn't that easy to hear
A	yeah
B	on the first couple
A	yeah yeah
B	cos we'd turned your mum up so loud I couldn't hear anything else
A	the problem with playing there just at the end I could hear the raw sound coming out of my fiddle great but I couldn't really hear the amp sound so I was playing
B	no
A	as loud as I could thinking that that was it but forgetting all the time that I don't need to play loud because
B	yes
A	yeah er
B	yeah cos it's er the the the amp's
A	yeah
B	doing your work for you
A	I still felt a bit more comfortable just playing out a bit up upstairs I thought there was there was nothing wrong with that the for the but yeah
B	upstairs was excellent I thought we really played well upstairs really played well
A	yeah
B	I mean that's two gigs where we've just stood and played tune
A	yeah
B	after tune after tune after tune
A	and the one thing is it'll get a lot easier as well though
B	yeah well it's
A	you know
B	it's it's got easier for me I'm I'm far more comfortable with them now
A	yeah
B	after gigging them
B	hard
A	yeah that Welcome Home is a crowd pleaser
B	oh it is
A	yeah I love that slidey do on it
B	it is yeah
A	going into the B part I just think that's
B	oh yes
A	yeah
B	yeah I thought it needed the
A	with the
B	yeah down to B minor
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	and that B minor that's a bit of a trick I put in cos I realise that if you've got a minor at the start of the second section it just sort of hits them if you know what I mean? that B minor chord hits them
B	it
A	it smashes into them
B	yeah it's almost like a key change isn't it?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	but in actual fact
B	oh so it is
A	yeah
B	that minor? well it's clever stuff
B	song writing craft
A	it's it it's hard though you run out of ideas all of a sudden and the next one comes along it's
B	mm
A	yeah
B	I very often get lost in it
A	oh
B	for some
A	it's really hard it's because the emphasis of the it's easy to play the melody where if you're accompanying it it feels like a four two four time or four four but it's in three four it's really complicated it's a whole it's a strathspey so naturally it feels like it should be in four four and then the emphasis is sometimes on the second beat of the bar but it's written in three four so it's really technically a difficult chord to
A	yeah
B	to accompany
A	yeah it is yeah yeah I'll have to I know you said early on it's in three four and when we played it at the end I'd forgotten that I'll I'll have to erm
A	yeah it sort of goes
B	think two three
A	one two three one two three
B	one two three
A	one yeah
B	one two three one two three
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	but that one er
B	it was good
A	yeah
B	so a lot of people came up and said how much they enjoyed it
A	oh good
B	yeah
A	which is really interesting really I could spend hours just talking about that itself but that's that whole piece is just based around the pentatonic scale I was sort of humming it around in my head and it sort of spat that out
B	is it? pentatonic yeah
A	studies have shown that the pentatonic scale it comes up in every culture in the world independently of itself and a lot of
B	really?
A	animals replicate it as well yeah and so
B	I didn't know I didn't know that I mean
A	which is probably another reason why it's a people enjoy it
B	it's a it's a it's a you know it's a guitarist's scale for
A	yeah
B	for melodic improvisation
A	yeah yeah
B	it doesn't have any minors in does it
A	yeah
B	for that sort of
B	no
A	blues sound
B	or it doesn't flatten the
A	well it it sort of like you what you can get is
B	mm
A	as well there's no semitones in it
B	no
A	so in a normal scale and F sharp and G between those two you've got a semitone but if in the pentatonic scale there's none of those
B	yeah
A	oh
B	whole no certainly yeah
A	yeah whole notes are bigger if you ever get a chance and you're on the internet and you're a bit bored have a look at the er pentatonic scale I think it was a TED conference T E D conference some neuroscience conference and it's Jamaican I think he's Jamaican reggae style singer slash musicologist comes on and he does an experiment with the audience and it's really interesting and he does the pentatonic scale and he proves how it's in everyone's head and it's really good he sort of improvises around it
B	oh wow
B	I
A	yeah T E D er pentatonic scale that's all you really need to put in
B	T E right I'll have a look at that that sounds interesting I I'd no idea that it was inbuilt
A	no you'll recognise the man I think I think he's quite well known I didn't but some said he's well known and the tune he hums along as well is actually quite catchy and quite good
B	yeah
A	wherever I've
B	yeah
A	done that it's always worked
B	oh well it won't hurt
A	I think they're just quite disorganised people to be honest
B	I think they erm
A	oh
B	themselves into the ground
A	yeah
B	oh yeah yeah
A	the British Humanist Association of England lady
B	they were the the best man said the er he said they'd be
A	yeah
B	very successful but they ever get out of bed in time
A	yeah yeah I mean why not? why not like definitely
B	well if you can do it
A	he he seems like an interesting chap as well I think he worked for British Rail and
B	yeah
A	it's a good idea what they did with remotes in Currys PC World was it or Dixons
B	nice one
A	as it was
B	nice one
A	go and get a remote control and turn all the volume down
B	yeah
A	if
B	or
A	yeah
B	change the
A	yeah
B	channels up that that must be a gas doing that
A	I I wonder if they got caught that would have been an interesting way to finish the story if they'd been caught or what had happened to them or if
B	yeah
A	somehow completely destroyed
B	you can get universal ones can't you?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	er even like Sky remotes people pay twenty-five quid for a branded Sky one and then at Argos you can pick up one for four ninety-nine
A	it might not have the Sky logo on but it does the job
B	but it does the trick yeah well it's only a radio transmitter isn't it?
A	yeah
B	when all is
A	yeah
B	said and done or is it
A	oh
B	infrared is it line of sight?
A	er oh
B	ours it ours at home is line of sight so I think it might be infrared
A	they don't yeah I think you might be right actually there yeah infrared would be a lot safer than radio I'd have thought it's just that bit towards the centre
B	yeah
A	of the spectrum
B	yeah
A	oh
B	oh
A	rabbit which is R erm what's the next one?
A	no sorry from er rabbit's radio mate microwave in infrared then visible very exciting is er oh no unusual that's it ultraviolet
B	violet yeah
A	and erm extraordinary gardens which is X-ray gamma rays
B	oh brilliant
A	it's good isn't it? yeah
B	yeah
A	I don't know about the TV I think there's something like more words for a TV remote than anything else really aren't there? if you think about it
B	more words for
A	a TV remote everyone's got their own little bit of slang for it
B	yeah oh yeah
