A	okay what did you want to to say? to talk about?
A	a
B	about slaves
A	about slaves
C	what would you do?
B	well we've had to be very very rich to have slaves
C	mm not necessarily
B	well yes
C	mm mm
B	cos in those days couldn't find like five poor people twelve slaves could you?
C	well it depends if you're wealthy but not rich then you could get a slave
A	but wealthy does mean rich though
C	well normal
A	normal medium rich
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	medium
C	wait would it be kind of your age group?
B	yeah just a little over my age
C	well then definitely not your size group
B	so and then erm
A	and
B	yeah and if you were
B	and maybe get children like
C	what? do you mean like marry them?
B	or thirty
C	would you marry him?
B	well technically yes
C	no
A	you'd marry your slave?
C	technically yes
B	yeah because he'd be a boy and he'd be really nice
A	okay
C	what if he wasn't? what if he wanted to be treated badly?
B	then I would kick him out of my
C	well then you could treat
A	hang on well then hang
B	I'm gonna kick you out
A	oh kick him out
C	I would just whip him well if he was really bad
A	nice
C	if he was really mean to all my friends and I would wanna go
B	well
B	I would get a whip and only use it if he was really bad like you said
B	oh I'm not gonna I'm not gonna like you any more
C	well when he ate all your chocolate?
B	no
A	do you do you think a slave would be rude if they knew they were a slave?
C	yeah probably
B	I don't know
C	well if they were treated
A	doubt it
C	far too nicely they might
A	oh
C	take their chances I wouldn't but
A	do you think I treat you two nicely? do you think I should get a
C	no
A	get a whip out?
A	no?
B	you treat us just right mum
A	okay just interested that you quite
C	yes but
B	what does educate mean?
A	well would you send them to school?
B	yeah
A	would you teach them? let them learn how to read and write?
B	yeah
A	yeah cos well they didn't they didn't bother
C	mm
B	mummy
A	in those days
C	if it didn't cost any money
A	well it would cost you money cos you have to have a teacher
B	mm
C	yeah but I mean going to a school for free like
A	but yes but there weren't schools like that at the time
B	yeah they're a bit
C	oh I do need one of those
B	and do you know what? in the time of Shakespeare it was rude to use English
A	rude to use English?
B	yeah
A	what did people use? French?
B	Latin stuff
C	Portuguese?
B	Rome
C	how is it?
B	Italian?
C	it wasn't rude to use English but they
B	Rome
A	Rome? that's they spoke Italian? well and Latin?
C	well
B	I mean and they
A	do you mean they were still speaking Latin?
B	so it was a punishment if you
B	and you would get a punishment if you spoke it
C	but
A	really?
C	you learned English in school
A	hang on a
C	erm another one like this
B	yes but it was but it wasn't good if you used it
A	that's another one
A	you'd get a whipping
C	you'd get a whipping if you used the language native to that country
B	well in
A	you should google that one
B	well in ta
C	you have found that from Hetty Feather
A	I was gonna say that is Hetty Feather sort of
B	I know
A	Victorianish times
B	yeah
A	but they didn't have schools in Shakespeare's time really
B	yeah but
C	I have an idea
B	there were some schools but not many and for the boys they had to get up like five o'clock no
A	but they had private schools well public schools they were called for small groups of boys and girls
A	but mainly boys
A	you don't have to whisper can I take it apart?
C	yeah
A	can you say it properly?
B	can you please take these apart mum?
A	yeah we're doing Lego things erm
B	don't
A	well it's impossible to take it off otherwise
A	erm so
C	if I had a slave I would treat them very nice
A	nicely mm
C	I would
A	hang on turn around
A	you're
A	mm
C	I would treat them very nicely
A	right
C	I would make sure they would get educated
A	okay
C	make sure they wouldn't eat all my chocolate
A	well I don't think they would darling
B	chocolate
A	oh that's a good question
B	mm
A	I don't know
C	or you could just google
C	I'm just saying you could it was so it'd be so much more easy oh can we?
A	I imagine that chocolate was around sort of Renaissance time
C	it was it was around in the First World in the First World War
A	yeah but renaissance Shakespeare time is five hundred years ago darling
C	mm
B	was that before the First World War?
A	yeah cos that was about a hundred years ago wasn't it?
C	no the Second World War was a hundred years ago
A	no the First World War was a hundred years ago
C	and how long ago was the Second World War?
A	okay well the Second World War was in the
B	so not long?
A	and it's two thousand and sixteen now so when it's two thousand and forty-two oh gosh I can't even well thirty-
B	wow they must be very old
A	they are very old but they were some of them were very young when they
C	oh
A	signed up to fight they lied and said that they were older so some of them were very very young indeed
B	so like thirteen?
A	yeah and then they saw some awful awful things
B	so they thought it would be a good were they bad people?
A	no they were brave they wanted to fight for their country
B	but then they were scared
C	no they weren't
A	but then it was well war is a terrible thing but this particular war was horrific and it really did damage a lot of people
B	yeah and do you know what?
A	mm?
B	I think that most of them they might be quite young so that if they did it
A	mm?
B	then they'd be terrified they would be so shocked they might get a heart they might get erm
C	a heart attack?
B	heart attack
A	well do you know what? I think it's amazing that so many of them are still alive and I think that it's almost like they lived through such a
B	mm
C	oi mum I don't really get what's going on in this Lego
B	mum?
C	think I might've
A	you must have
C	placed something on incorrectly
A	okay well have a look
B	mum I'm actually proud of the men who
A	me too
C	oh look now I'm exactly I know exactly what I'm doing there
B	because they left their children they left their wife
C	oh and
A	well they were children themselves some of them weren't they?
B	and they
A	really
B	and they did it because they knew they had to fight against their country
C	and because they
A	mm fight for their country yes
C	and because they wanted
A	I'm sure some of them did sign up thinking it would be an adventure and I think that's what they were sort of saying in the publicity like join up and be a hero and see the world and all that kind of thing they certainly didn't think they were going to see awful awful things
B	yeah I think it's bad for people to
C	well if you survive that might actually happen
A	yes it might do but there were there were better ways of
A	but they
B	no idea
C	er no
A	okay it's where people didn't believe they didn't want to fight they thought that fighting was not something that they agreed with and they objected to the war so they refused to sign up and fight erm people are allowed to do that now but
C	why? because they were
A	they were called cowards
C	because they
B	just because they didn't want a war to happen that doesn't mean they're cowards does it? because
C	well to be fair I don't think anybody actually wanted the war to happen but they knew what would happen if they did say that
A	it's a difficult argument because actually if we hadn't fought up
B	attacked in public?
A	mm
B	what does that mean?
A	people used to spit on them and call them nasty names and and actually so my great-uncle was a conscientious objector so he didn't fight but he ended up being erm he drove an ambulance and did lots of very brave things to help people so in fact he was a brave person but everyone always used to call him a coward
B	but you know what? the bravest thing in the world?
A	the bravest thing in the world? mm?
B	is caring for somebody
A	yeah
B	and like looking after them when they're hurt because you know what?
C	I've finished this page in terms of finding things
B	fighting and erm war was just one of
A	mm?
B	some bad people don't understand it
A	people just didn't really understand a lot of things at the time
B	yeah
A	and
B	but if you fight and war if if
A	I think they were very brave to stand up for how they felt
B	and if you like
C	mm mm mm
B	be really bad and try to and try to put somebody away then you don't then you need to learn
A	what do you need to learn?
B	you need to learn that it's not
A	I think people were just terrified that if everybody stood up and said
B	yeah
A	I'm not gonna fight then
B	everybody
A	we would've been in real difficulties wouldn't we?
B	mm
A	cos the
C	why?
B	oh it was only men
B	was it only
A	well that's interesting isn't it? well at the
B	because I don't think they could they believed that women did it
A	they didn't let women fight at the time and people women are still not allowed to fight on the front line even today
B	but the front line is for really very good people?
A	no it's no
B	oh
C	well that
A	that's the first sort of
B	that's harsh
C	well
A	ah
C	I
A	I think it was more that they said that if they had a woman there it would distract the men because they would want to protect this is their still their argument today that they would want to protect the women and so they would get distracted and be
A	poorer soldiers cos they wouldn't be doing their job er they also that women don't fight as well as men
B	that's
A	erm it's interesting though isn't it?
C	yeah I think it's quite a stupid idea of thinking that
B	mm
A	but what happened in the war
B	yeah
B	because go go and look after the children
C	well men can look after children just fine then I really do need to get the T-shirt
B	yeah but the men needed their jobs as well
A	well shut shut the window if you're chilly
A	and that
B	their dad
A	most of the
B	yeah
A	so he was a stay at home dad when they were little
C	cos I you said you said I would become a great father and husband and I think that's going to be the case
A	yeah and you'd be a great stay at home dad as well
C	yeah thank you
A	if you wish to do that
B	it's quite mean cos if they didn't graduate then they wouldn't know anything
A	well people thought that women were not as intelligent or even
C	that's
A	running even running marathons women were not allowed to run marathons for a very long time
C	that's very
B	you've run a marathon
A	I haven't yet but when when women did try and run marathons
B	a girl called
A	a girl called
B	yeah
A	from Blue Peter?
B	yes she did
C	what about White Peter?
A	what about?
C	White Peter?
C	mm mm
A	especially as you were sick
C	well I think that should've been the case
A	mm
C	no I think is it? now you think about it was that a good idea?
A	yeah but
C	well
A	I I don't know maybe if I wrote and asked them
B	if you said my
A	could you speak coherently and say that again?
B	it'd it'd be really funny if we said oh my poor
A	well I'll be able to flash my eyelashes in a letter
B	lashes
A	but yes
B	no no like you can say it to them
A	I could say it that's true
B	and this
A	do you think that would work? would that make a difference?
B	no and if it and if they don't say then I'll say hey I'm cleared up and I really wanna go back again I'll be
A	let me dismantle
A	I can't find that piece can you? the
A	maybe I'll use you
C	I can figure I can figure out which piece it is
A	sorry
B	can use this piece
A	oh maybe that's it
C	no we need a black one
A	is that a black one? I thought it was a dark grey one
A	thank you
A	oh thanks
B	she's young
C	no she looks young she's almost forty
A	I know
B	she's so young she's still young
A	young at heart
C	and young at looks
B	she young in body
C	you still don't look
B	oh wow
B	the oldest you

B	yeah
A	of of of all of them I think we've done this is our third isn't it?
C	mm could be fourth
B	no we did the daffodil one
C	well there's daffodil discovery
A	and explore that was definitely
C	I can but I can't
A	we could go to
A	I I doubt it would be the same set of clues it might be I suppose but it'll be in a different place won't it?
B	if it is then I'll just say
B	yeah it's okay
A	yeah you wouldn't mind if you knew would you
B	no
A	did you like the little wooden goslings?
C	which?
B	thank you
A	they were sweet weren't they?
B	yeah it was
A	goslings

C	you're making quite a big
A	you are
A	a quite a big what
B	I don't
B	I don't know if I should put this in here
A	oh if it it fits you should just

B	it's actually a globe I made it up
A	ah that's very nice
C	you may need to take their satellite
A	okay right
B	no these are the so you do that and
A	oh it is a satellite?
B	you do so you have it like this when you put it in
A	mm?
B	but when you want it you can take it out and do this
C	don't you mean when you want to?
B	then you can see what erm it has it's happened
C	ah ah

C	mm
A	well once it is all together it is pretty sturdy so
C	pretty sturdy?
A	but we're nearly there
A	and
C	less than
C	a lot
A	the final page is a hundred and fifty-five
B	one five five
A	it's not too bad
A	you did a lot of it yourself
B	cos if you didn't and we had to start from scratch
B	and we had to start from scratch
A	shh
B	we'd be here like all day
A	forever yeah I know but we might as well be cos the weather's so awful
C	ah
B	we wouldn't be able to see
C	what?
A	do you want me to hold a piece of it
C	no it just keeps on falling off
A	well it didn't the one before
C	pardon?
A	it didn't before
A	are you alright? do you want me to hold it?
C	this time it's different
B	no

B	yeah
A	well if you've got toddlers then you'll be up early but you're a bit
C	why?
A	cos toddlers get up really early
C	why?
A	cos they just do
B	oh
A	that's just what
B	I mum er whenever I get

A	he doesn't really like you?
C	I think he does
B	well he likes me
A	he's just a
A	cos he's invited you to tea which is extremely exciting
B	can't wait I told
B	after Easter
A	but did you say thank you?
B	mm yes
A	you didn't just quiz him as to why he's he'd asked you?
C	why have you asked me?
B	no
A	no it's very exciting
C	I probably ask that okay I'd probably be quite polite
A	good
B	are you using these?
C	unless of course it was my friend
A	we we probably will be using those
A	right have you finished on this page
C	I'm not
A	not the brown one
C	wait I haven't finished yet
A	I can't believe the photographer's gone on holiday
C	so it means he can't sort out his photographs?
A	he's not sorting out the photographs till he gets back but he's a bit poorly anyway
C	oh
A	I want to see them
C	my gosh how could he do that?
A	so if I was a highwayman in real life would you be my assistants?
B	yeah
A	do you think you'd be ruthless?
C	but mum
B	yeah
C	if you were a highwayman I'll then I'll just run away from you
A	well no I wouldn't be
C	oh mum
B	if you
C	cos no one would collect us
A	yeah
B	then I would just be in then I would just be like erm I'd be really scared cos I erm it always seems to happen that a highwaywoman or man gets captured
A	yeah but I wouldn't because I'd be the best
B	mum?
A	yes
B	don't boast
A	I would be
C	she she would
B	keep on boasting
A	but I would be
B	keep boasting
A	and I would just sort any nasty man out
C	or woman
A	or woman
B	or spank them
C	or toucan
B	spank their bottoms
B	mum
A	or you could make
C	I would believe me
B	if that did
A	come over here
C	I'd figure out
B	then
A	no but you if we were if we obviously we'd be rich be educated so I would pay to have a tutor
B	oh
C	and
A	ah well eventually you might wonder
B	well I'd be
C	no I would definitely figure out
B	I would like I would like begging you to tell me
A	but then what if I said I
B	yeah I'd scream and tell the police
A	what? you'd you'd have me hanged would you?
B	no I'll tell the
A	or arrested and hanged rather
B	I'll tell them I
C	hey mum look
A	I don't think you would tell the police
C	hey mum look this
A	oh joints
C	although that's not actually what it's meant to be doing
A	here's a bit right okay I know right
A	well we've nearly
A	well because we've done one wing already it's not so tricky is it? cos we're
C	no
A	sort of remembering is that light grey or a dark one?
C	oh yeah I've already done that
A	oh
A	stop doing it
A	wow
C	about we're all the pieces and then building it I didn't know a thing
C	until now
C	when I told you
A	okay so are you excited about this circus workshop in the actual big tent in an actual circus on
B	yeah
A	I am so excited
B	you
C	you're going to get invited to the circus by the way
A	do you think I'll be? do you think they'll ask me to join the circus? that'd be amazing
B	yes
C	although they don't get paid very much
A	no I don't think they get paid very much
C	I'm not sure if they paid that erm they might get like one pound er a day
A	I'm sure they get more than that but no they just do it for the love it don't they?
C	one pound
A	although some of the people in this circus have come from different parts of Europe so that's quite exciting
B	I'd be surprised if someone said I'm a German a German
A	you would be surprised if someone said what?
B	I'm a German guy?
A	you're German? no they're not from
C	Germany
A	and other places like that
C	Poland
B	pig land
C	pig land?
B	I said pig land
C	you said
A	but
C	Russia?
A	yeah but these ones I think are from Poland
C	cool yo Poland
A	I'll have to check
C	Poland
A	stop it
A	stop it
C	it just sound funny
A	so we saw Harry Potter six and we're now not seeing Harry Potter seven
C	I am I'm seeing it with you er when
A	I mean the only thing I can do is start reading you the books again but I don't know if I can bring myself to do that
C	we'll have to finish all the other books that we're reading first
A	I know it's just that they're so long mind you they're not as long as Harry Potter five which we did read but that took me nine months to read to you
C	really?
A	mm it took a really long time and also they just get dark and depressing I just wanted to watch the first three films again cos they're the best number three's the best book and film I think cos it's all just nice and about school and things like that rather than
C	and about destroying a basilisk
A	yeah but it Voldemort's sort of in the background rather than just being there all the time
C	you have got that part part right by the way
A	being dark and scary
C	and irritating
A	but that's the thing really they don't
C	ah
A	they don't they're not really at school in the next film
C	no they're not
A	so all of that kind of fun stuff is not there
C	at all
C	any more
A	which is a shame have you put the satellite in in your little building
B	yeah mum I have
A	mm
B	mum do you know why I'm like building these things
A	dunno why I suggested I would do that
B	because in here
C	you should say sorry
A	I can't I can't let them down what I'm hoping is that they'll no one'll turn up
B	is in Tommy's mum look it's Tom Riddle's book
A	okay
C	Tom Riddle's diary
B	and in here is a satellite
A	okay
B	do you know why I'm doing it?
A	no tell me
B	because the I've got these things and I thought well if I have like some secret cupboards it'll be really cool cos they actually have some things in
A	some like secret compartments and things?
B	no
A	well you oh
C	oh secret compartments they are so clever to make in Lego
B	with things in
C	solve a riddle
B	erm and
A	I would like to take you to a proper ice skating rink
B	I've been to a proper ice skating rink twice
A	no no no not the ones they put on a temporary basis
C	oh
A	but like one that's there all the time in a massive building
A	cos it's much easier to skate on the
B	I've been there
A	when?
C	why?
A	but that's they're that's the temporary one at the garden centre or at

C	piece of smelly cheese
A	well you know the smelly one of the smelliest cheeses is called the Stinking Bishop
A	and it is really stinky but it tastes delicious
A	yeah and they I they probably still sell it in the cheese shop in
A	and one of the Wallace and Gromit films mentioned and then everybody wanted to buy it and all these Americans wanted to buy it but it's a it's just a man doing it like really really small quantities of cheese a year and then everyone had bought it and they said we want more and he said well hard luck I don't make very much so you're gonna have to wait and I liked that attitude that he wasn't prepared to suddenly employ loads of people and work all the time
C	why?
A	well because it would've been a short-lived fad anyway and he said no this is what I do and I enjoy it and I don't want to I mean lots of other people
A	have you got one of these pieces
C	yeah I need two

A	tapping everything? mm
B	I've already got this dress
