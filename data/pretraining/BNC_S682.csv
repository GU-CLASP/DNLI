A	oh I like your background
B	it was like a Japanese
A	did you take that picture huh?
B	no it's just off Google
A	let's have a look?
B	I just shut down
A	oh you shut down your computer?
B	well I have to swap over to Windows but I'll
A	ah
B	I'll
A	what is it you're running on if it's not Windows?
B	it's the Mac operating system
A	is it just called Mac operating system?
B	it's OSX ten point something
A	OS what? do you mind if I leave this up here?
B	yeah
A	alright
B	yeah
A	yeah
A	so the thing when you're travelling and doing so many things you do tend to not read very much
B	I know I thought I'd be reading lots
B	to be honest I thought I'd just be like chilling on the beach doing nothing but it got too hot to sit on the beach
A	yeah
B	yeah it is
A	where did you get these from? just any website in particular or you just searched? beautiful Japanese image
B	yeah I think that's the coolest one I've got the other ones are kind of just a bit stock
A	yeah okay was this one stock?
B	no
A	no?
B	got it off Google
A	ah dude your desktop is horrible
B	is a bit? what do you mean? that it's
A	how unorganised it is
B	yeah you have
A	oh this is the these things that these can do when you pay a lot of money
B	suppose
A	ooh does that slow it down at all?
B	no
A	it's just too fast
B	yeah it's quite cool
A	but this all this crap on your desktop is that just
B	it's not really needed
A	you being unorganised?
B	I could probably clear it up
B	but I can't be bothered
A	how do you find stuff that you don't sit looking through them?
B	well the stuff that is on here's not stuff that I really need access to
A	for
B	don't really have many apps up there just Utorrent
A	okay and you're telling me I needed all those apps?
B	mm
A	those ones
A	Word Powerpoint which version of of Word and Powerpoint have you got?
B	this is a Mac one or
A	does it just come free with it?
B	no I just torrented it just cos it's for two thousand eleven
A	oh cool
A	I'm running on like yeah Windows two thousand eleven I think or Windows two thousand and nine
B	mm
A	does the job
B	yeah
A	so what kind of games do you think we've got?
B	ah bunch

B	did I show you that Planetside game?
A	no what was that?
B	that's a shooter
A	yeah
B	it's quite cool
A	is it two player?
B	it's not two player
A	is it one that you have to like take turns doing it?
B	possibly yeah
A	right
B	I will get it updated and download it and I'll show you that quickly
A	I'm up for playing a few games I got nothing else to do tonight if you're up for it
B	sure
A	cool
B	we're probably not gonna let you play directly the learning curve is
A	yeah
A	it looks a bit crazy
B	it's not
A	so
B	it's just some random background
A	cool
B	yeah it's like a giant
A	I think you've been playing this for years haven't you?
B	that was Planetside one they rereleased it
A	oh
B	like er last year
A	so you're gonna play one game put a one player game first?
B	yeah
A	cool
B	but it might take
A	welcome to
B	while I do this I'll set up the emulator
A	did you put the amp up on Ebay?
B	huh?
A	did you put the amp up on Ebay?
B	no I can't until I can test it and I can't test it until the
A	oh shit
B	yeah
A	yeah I do
B	it's a good one
A	do you not need it?
B	I don't need it
A	but I mean like
B	ah this stood the test of time I don't think it'll break it's
B	doesn't matter
A	cool I mean yeah that
B	it's it's a really good mouse
A	really cool
B	yeah
A	oh that's pretty useful
B	yeah
A	what are the buttons on the side?
B	er
A	really? why why did you stop using it?
B	just cos I got that one
A	does look pretty nice
B	yeah
A	yeah what's meant to be better about this one?
B	nothing
B	but that was like a fifty quid mouse
A	oh bloody hell
B	it's just
A	you sure you wanna put that into my
B	yeah it's fine
A	uncapable hands? and then this is just an Xbox controller?
B	yeah
A	through and through
B	mm
A	I'm gonna be so crap
B	no I read that one
A	you did?
B	yeah
A	do you like it?
B	yeah it was good
A	it's a good book isn't it that one?
B	what's that book?
A	can't even remember what I bought you now
B	well the film's crap so
A	the film's terrible but don't not read the book because of that because the book is nothing like the film
B	is it?
A	nothing like it
B	really?
A	it's quite
B	how did they make a film out of it and call it World War Z?
A	what's this in Meteora Greece
B	yeah
A	and then the film
B	god the film's crap
A	had nothing to do with it whatsoever
B	it's just action
B	yeah
A	dad liked it
B	I don't think he liked it that much like when I
A	did you?
B	and like I had
B	it's
A	it's pretty poor yeah
B	oh shit
A	it's worth reading don't let the film put you off
B	this is like a massive game
A	I wonder if I can put this like that
A	yeah I know
B	perhaps
A	the speakers are coming
B	it has
A	oh that's true yeah it will get a lot of keyboard
B	I think it'll be alright
A	yeah
B	I dunno
A	yeah no it's not
B	reflects
A	actually pointing towards us
B	but now I can't play
A	is there not room for your mouse there if you move the keyboard over a little bit like that?
A	is that good?
B	it's rubbish
A	you've not lost any space
B	oh my god
A	these are your nice speakers aren't they?
B	yeah
A	mine are crap
B	right
A	a while ago
B	by the looks of things
A	alright that's picking up
B	that's good
B	what?
B	okay so I'll play with the keyboard which is gonna be confusing
A	oh so we are playing two player?
B	I'll try it
A	yeah cool
B	but not for that game
A	yeah
B	A W
A	buttons
A	that keyboard is so small
B	yeah
A	how do you fit your hands on that?
B	set space
A	do you normally play games with the controller then?
B	what what it can pick up the mouse as the controller that's a bit weird
A	can it?
B	look look watch
A	what if we talk?
B	no it's it's picking up the mouse on here
A	oh the mouse?
A	yeah that is weird
B	I dunno how if that would work very well
A	how that's very sensitive
B	I can't imagine playing like that
A	no
B	give it a try
A	what game we playing first then?
B	well I've got Super Smash
A	oh you do?
B	yeah
A	is it the same version that I know?
B	no it's probably a newer one
A	oh cool
B	erm
A	I'm up for playing that
B	Underside
A	cool
B	maybe it'll work maybe it won't
A	what wasn't working about it before?
B	it just doesn't start
A	it's a long game
B	this is a long game
A	when was the last time you played it?
B	weeks
A	I haven't really played very often
B	I try to I tend to play one game and just play the shit out of it
A	yeah
B	and not touch anything else
A	do you remember that game you played like Evil something
B	god that was boring
A	was it?
B	yeah
A	you flew around in space
B	yeah yeah
B	it was like a
B	yeah
A	you played
B	well cos like you had the ability to get so rich and like control so much but like it never happened
A	no
B	and it just took so much work
B	and like anyone could just come out of anywhere and blow your shit up and destroy you and then you're back to square one
B	like no
A	don't destroy me
B	five hundred hours
B	of this and
B	this and now you're holding me for ransom
B	no it's not so good this working
A	well this isn't working
B	no that's not working
A	I remember playing Settlers that was a fun game
B	that was rubbish
B	that was just was bad
A	Total Annihilation
B	right Super Smash Brawl
A	I like that one as well
B	Total Annihilation was awesome
A	oh is this a Wii version?
B	oh have you seen the new Total Annihilation?
A	no
B	oh man they redid it yeah this is the Wii version let me see if I can find that game if I've still got it installed
A	how big's your hard drive on this one?
B	erm terabyte it's split up between quite a few things like
A	partitions
B	ah no I don't think I've got it
A	do you uninstall games quite frequently?
B	yeah
A	do you think Windows Defender is okay? that's just my the only virus thing that I've got on
B	dunno sounds like
A	apparently it's
B	I don't think it's gonna rain
A	no but still
B	yeah
A	the dew starts coming out
B	let me have a look ah
A	what are you looking for?
B	I'll have a look on my hard drive
A	where would it be? on your old hard drive?
B	whoops
A	where's what?
B	oh here it is
A	have you got a WD My Passport one as well?
B	not My
A	oh cool
B	something or other
A	hang on a sec
B	see if this works
A	online interaction's not rated
B	yeah
A	the one on the N sixty-four was pretty fun wasn't it?
B	yeah
A	so it should work
B	yes there you go
A	good stuff
B	right there you go
A	are you prepared to get whooped
B	ah
B	probably
A	so what is it in general? can you remember?
B	just gonna get the wireless keyboard
A	yeah that is pretty useful
B	these controllers these controllers are gonna be a pain to remember
A	yeah
B	erm right
A	is this just you against me first?
B	yeah we'll have a quick practice
A	Olimar? what is that? oh he's from erm
B	Pikmin
B	I've got that as well
A	that was kind of fun
B	Ike's my favourite
A	ah there was two of them and it was
B	Marth
A	Fox was quite good
B	yeah
A	hang on these look like the same characters as last time
A	mm
B	erm shall we have me and you against
A	right okay
B	this is five
B	erm
A	you gotta keep beating them up until you can throw em completely off the screen?
B	yeah
A	that was a good concept
B	here we go
A	cool
B	you should remember this
A	and I'm Zelda
B	yeah that's not a
A	who's that dude not moving at the top? Link
B	oh that's erm he's not really there
A	so is it me and you against these two?
B	yeah
A	cool
B	I might need to mess with the settings on this it's not perfect
A	I used to know all the moves and stuff now I don't know how to do anything
B	right let's let's try something
A	yeah it is a bit laggy
B	let's try the different Dolphin
A	yeah I remember having a Dolphin
B	I dunno
A	yeah
B	probably
A	what do you think could be going wrong?
B	I dunno I probably don't have things set right
B	hang on
A	I mean it was running
B	yeah
A	it's definitely a bit laggy though
B	file
A	Gamecube
A	see what they say
B	so Dolphin Super Smash Bro Brawl
A	do you have to set it up differently for every game then?
B	sometimes yeah
A	oh no
B	erm configurations
A	skip graphics
B	ah where is that?
A	there
B	there we go
A	skip
B	okay is that it? there's nothing else? nothing else what?
A	what other kind of settings should there be?
B	I don't know but I had it working perfectly once
B	no for some reason
A	maybe that thing you just clicked will do it
B	let's see
A	did you exit the game or are we just paused?
B	er it's exited
A	oh no
A	you look like you have Zelda on there
B	yeah I do
A	the original Zelda?
B	yeah I think I got that as well
A	did they ever release a newer one?
B	yeah they did
A	was it any good?
B	yeah it was
A	yeah
B	oh let's just do this bit first
A	I never completed the original one either
A	ah
B	well this looks faster
A	so what's it doing? yeah it looks much faster
B	I dunno
A	cool
B	I think I'm these I'm two people
A	yeah you are
B	well I think we are actually
A	ah
B	right shall we repick our characters?
A	yeah I'm still trying to figure it out let me play with this guy for a little bit
B	alright
A	that one used to ah that was how you did that
B	it's one of the side buttons
A	oh yeah
B	like Z or something but there is no Z so it's must be a shoulder
A	that one yeah?
B	yeah ah
A	oh yeah and you have a defence bubble
B	yeah
A	I forgot that
B	I don't know where my button for that is
A	that's the shoulder buttons
B	no not that you can charge
A	how do you grab them?
B	erm using the
A	how do you throw em
B	just
A	yeah

A	is there two of you?
B	I didn't know they could do that that's cool
A	yeah

B	there we go
A	oh no he's headbutting me
B	you're lucky you have
A	oh
B	what what?
B	we've lost
A	what happened there we just all had three hundred percent health
B	yeah
A	just one hit
B	pretty much
A	they haven't really changed anything
B	no not really
A	no
B	you get extra moves
A	all the moves are the same
B	you do have more moves than the original
A	you do
B	Brawl
A	like
B	yeah
A	this thing's
B	it has changed a bit like they don't really do much like they just made the graphics a lot better

B	and kind of refined
A	oh Lucas is that guy with the yoyo isn't it?
B	yeah
A	Diddy Kong wasn't in it before was he?
B	no

A	yeah how do we take em off?
B	there we go
A	there we go
B	let's change this
A	yeah just
B	five lives

A	yeah
B	this one's pretty cool
A	what's cool about this one?
B	the
A	oh what? I thought I was a Pokemon Trainer
B	you were a Pokemon but some one of his moves is to swap out for another Pokemon
A	ah ah

B	it you shot out with a staple and caught on how the hell do you do that?
A	erm I just used my up and B really
B	oh no
B	yeah it's cool
A	I always thought you could throw these things
B	I used to play this for hours rather than go to school
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	oh shit
B	oh the usual crap
A	yeah? used to play things all the time when you were doing
B	er used to be like we just we'd fight for like ten minutes and like no moves would actually connect cos we'd be dodging everything
A	woah
B	yeah
A	woah
B	it was a star
A	ah shit I keep doing that by accident I don't mean to
B	we've got the like the power scale down low
A	oh shit
B	but like stay still for a second
A	no
B	I'll show you my guy's move

A	what happened there?
B	oh shit
B	that's got it
A	oh
B	yeah
A	that's all good
B	that'd be good
A	yeah that's the thing you've gotta listen you can't just cut the sound out and then it's goes to another
B	right
A	topic of conversation
B	you need to kind of work of trying to actually have a conversation and play it at the same time it's not so easy
A	no well we're doing it
B	kind of
A	yeah
B	but then there's the awkward silence where you get into playing cos
A	yeah
B	you forget
A	ah
B	yeah
A	we keep changing
B	yeah
A	oh
B	I've got erm ah do you remember? did you ever play Soulcalibur?

B	probably
A	yeah I bet
B	are you not?
A	no

A	er
B	maybe
B	let's try
B	god
A	try and quit L R A and start hang on
B	yeah but it doesn't work for you cos you're not playing
A	but if I pause it can I do that?
B	you can't pause it
A	right
B	cos you're not playing
A	I did something
B	we'll just restart
A	so this is for the Wii or isn't it? did the Wii ever get big?
B	not really
A	seemed a bit crappy to me
B	it was a bit
A	oh what are they doing next?
B	like the Gamecube was good
A	it was alright
B	and then it kind of
A	I really like Jet Force Gemini on it
B	yeah
A	that was a cool game
B	probably get that it was two player but like the second player didn't really do much
A	no
B	just play that little dog thingy or
A	oh yeah
B	could do that yeah
A	Meta Knight so I'm in right so what happened last time?
B	I don't know

B	when you do what?
A	he's lost it
B	down and B
A	down and B just changed
B	I think you've lost the whirlwind though
A	oh that was a good move

A	oh
B	play epic guitar solos
A	yeah
B	oh shit
A	I didn't know that they came
B	yeah
A	poor
B	doesn't do much

B	yeah
A	yeah yeah
B	no
A	ah you're alive
B	don't know
A	oh what is that
A	if you get hit by any one of those you die
B	mm
A	so it seems
B	let me see what this does
A	no
B	come on
A	you can just do it yourself
B	doesn't seem to do anything
A	oh crap
B	what is this supposed to do?
A	yes
B	that move hasn't done anything yet
A	alright well we're on zero zero so
B	yeah
A	if it hurts me I get to hurt you in equal proportion
B	ah yeah it's not sensitive enough
A	dunno
B	you've hurt me more than fourteen
A	I don't like his little
A	bastard
B	did you forget you could do that?
B	ah
A	ah
A	I doubt it we're both on zero
B	ah if I can get this
A	oh no
B	ah no
A	yeah
B	that was like
A	fair and square
B	ah man
A	one all
B	that was so bad

B	it's the windmills
A	oh yeah

A	yeah
B	oh
A	yeah yeah
B	ah man

A	who's this guy? Raphael
A	what have you
B	I don't know

A	yeah
B	this doesn't look like a fair fight look at them
A	no
B	I've got really short range weapons
A	yeah
A	maybe even when I kneel down I'm still the same size
A	ah

B	yeah
A	is he actually Zelda?
B	it's Zelda

B	Playstation I think they got like erm
A	the guy from Metal Gear Solid or something
B	yeah
A	we get gay old Link
B	yeah
A	so if he doesn't throw anything what's the point?
B	he does
B	he's probably gonna drink some milk
A	yeah
B	that was good
A	about to die
A	I give up on this game
B	I'm finding this one easier to beat you at
A	what? what happened there?
B	don't know
B	woah
A	is she good?
B	yeah she's gonna kick my arse
A	no
A	look at that mound in between her legs
B	I know
A	I don't know
A	wobbly boobs
A	I know
B	probably got like sixty percent of the pixel count is probably on boob
A	yeah
B	not many that are cool
A	not just on the emulator but just in general?
B	I don't have that many games any more
A	do you not?
B	no

A	are you trying to connect with the server?
B	yeah a problem
A	lovely
B	why do you do that?
A	wasn't me
A	what game would you just be playing now then would you just being playing
B	yeah I'd probably be playing that
A	it's not much fun to watch though
B	no
B	it's er
A	did they ever release a Battlestar Galactica game?
B	oh look it's working
B	yeah it's not so easy to play
A	I'm gonna need more space for the mouse on this one
B	okay
A	and you're saying let's play this game cos
B	on this game there's four continents
A	mm
B	two of them are locked at the moment but they're like completely different like this one's all icy
A	well
A	it's like Turok or something
B	yeah it is a bit like Turok in here
A	yeah the map's pretty big then?
B	yeah and there's
A	yeah there's a lot more in this one
B	oh I
A	oh nice
B	yeah it's quite good it's free
A	it's free?
B	yeah
A	sorry
B	I've got a portable rocket launcher
A	oh holy shit
B	this bit's really awesome
A	and then you can fire it? oh no way
B	yeah
A	oh I bet
B	and I've got some ammo
A	oh that's cool
B	on the rail grenade launcher
A	loads of them
B	different sights and stuff
A	oh
B	and er that's just for that one gun
A	you've got the set up you like there
B	there's tons of different guns so there's infiltrators which can go invisible
A	mm
B	engineers which can place shields and guns and shit
A	no
B	so I'm going to
A	you can get vehicles as well
B	redeploy
A	this game does look cool
B	yeah
A	right
B	Indar here we are
A	these maps are humongous
B	yeah they're quite big
A	where's that?
B	and at every
A	ooh
B	yeah so that's the infiltrator so you can go invisible
A	that's cool
B	that's looking a bit bugged there why's it blue? er I prefer engineer
A	he can fix things and stuff
B	yeah
A	what?
B	it's the portable shield
A	do they keep getting new staff then for the gear?
B	yeah
A	the whole world?
B	not the whole world but this part is called the Warp Gate and it's
A	oh cool
B	so it's like a safe zone
A	how many people can you get on one map?
B	hundreds
A	the continent is full
B	yeah it kind of is
A	yeah
B	a tank
A	it's massive
B	customise all the weapons
B	erm and then aircraft
A	cos you have to go and get all these little
B	yeah so
A	that that looks cool
B	this is the big transport for the galaxy which is from this one
A	yeah
B	I'm get a little fighter
A	oh you're straight in one
B	yeah
A	it's really hard to see
B	well
A	did you say your HUD? heads-up display?
B	yeah like where's all this information? okay oh well I'll fly around
A	yeah they look a bit difficult to manoeuvre
B	yeah
A	so where are you headed? how do you know which way to go?
B	ah right well I need to have a look at the map
A	is it quite difficult to land?
B	yeah woah woah woah woah woah
B	there we go
A	so where are we now?
B	I'm there
A	oh
B	so I'll go up here
A	yeah
B	that's probably more interesting than fighting them
A	over there
B	no here should be
A	very misty this map
B	yeah
A	oh you're doing pretty good
B	yeah I could but where's the fun in that?
A	could just choose the
B	if I go over the tree
A	woah
B	woah I won't see a thing will I?
A	er
B	woah
B	I don't have very good guns for this
A	no
B	just one main gun which is impossible to hit anyone with
A	can you just jump out of it now you're in it er?
B	you could yeah
A	okay
B	I don't really want to cos I don't get too many of these
A	oh you're burning out
A	seriously no good
B	no
A	suppose you got part of it there
B	yeah
A	how good's the sniper on this thing?
B	pretty good
A	is it fairly easy to kill people with this?
B	if I hit them in the head they're dead in one
A	two
B	there's no good vantage points here this is not a good idea
A	choose a different weapon?
B	yeah
