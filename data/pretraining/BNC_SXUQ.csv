B	does erm does dad often go to the pub with the boys now mum?
C	no never
B	it's unusual for today then
C	yeah
B	I don't see why he would doesn't occasionally I guess when you've got a house full I would
B	nothing else going on here
C	oh my god it ain't half coming down
B	oh dear
C	oh no
B	so he doesn't have his phone on him?

B	oh I'm glad I didn't go
A	yeah
B	not to sound selfish
C	it was lovely when they left and all weren't it?
A	yeah
B	that's just archetypal of the weather here isn't it?
A	this is typical British weather though
B	yeah
A	it'll stop in ten minutes won't it and then it won't look like it's rained at all
B	I know it is so
A	normally
B	changeable
A	yeah there's no other weather like it I don't think
B	really changeable no
A	oh bless them
B	you can tell when you know the sky in Korea you know you have a really dark morning and clouds gets thicker and you're like
A	yeah
B	it's gonna rain today and it rains but
A	it just comes on so quick here don't it?
A	mm
B	an island oh dear another day rained out then
A	yep
B	they managed
A	it was boiling hot
B	oh was it really hot?
A	it was ridiculously hot
B	oh
A	I mean they did it right smack bang in the middle of the afternoon as well
B	cos they don't think about the heat I suppose
A	cos last year they done it in the morning cos it was so hot
B	yeah
A	they done it at half past nine so like by eleven o'clock it was done
B	yeah
A	and then this yeah they done it smack bang in the
B	ah
A	we had to you have to take her
B	oh well
A	and she had about six to keep her cool
B	to keep her cool
A	but then
B	ah
A	all these other children get given ice poles at the end of sports day and she's like well I don't like it
B	ah what do I get? yeah
A	yeah what do I have? nothing darling I'm afraid
B	take you home we'll buy you another teddy another cuddly toy
A	I thought she would have grown out of it a bit by now
B	nah she seems to be quite into that still doesn't she?
A	pain in the backside
B	yeah
A	everywhere she goes she has to take a teddy bear with her
B	do you slowly do you slowly like filter them out?
A	yeah
B	oh right cos I can't imagine she's got much of a bedroom left
A	she if she'd kept every one she'd ever bought
B	yeah
A	she'd never be able to get in her bedroom
B	no yeah
A	but yeah I er what she got a new erm Frozen duvet cover a couple of months ago and erm when I said to her
B	mm
A	and erm I pulled everything off her bed cos she's got
B	oh right
A	cos you think I mean cos she's got like ten of the monkey Build-A-Bear size ones
B	oh yeah yeah she loves Build-A-Bear doesn't she?
A	and they're big they're pretty big
B	yeah
A	you know they take up half a bed just on their own so
B	is that a that's not a build bear Build-A-Bear is it?
A	that one is yeah a Build-A-Bear yeah
B	that big that big one in a dress?
A	yeah
B	oh
A	she's got about ten or eleven in that size
B	wow is that what they do at Build-A-Bear?
A	yeah you buy them unstuffed you just buy the like the shell
B	yeah yeah
A	and then they stuff it you get to put a heart inside it and
B	oh really?
A	so it's quite a good experience for them
B	oh is that why it's in this dress?
A	they even pick their own costumes
B	yeah
A	you can put sounds in them and er do all sorts
B	cos I've never seen a monkey you can buy that's quite got an outfit on like this
B	oh has it? you get two?
A	yeah she bought pyjamas too
B	ah
A	cos she wanted two outfits and nanny caved and gave her some money as well so
B	yeah
C	it was Wednesday and before they put the heart inside they get em to put it by their ears so
A	it's a good listener and they have to tell it a secret and
C	put it round their eyes so they can see em
B	oh really? the heart?
C	yeah
A	yeah
B	oh
A	and then they put it inside the bear
C	and then they put it inside the bear
A	and then they have you have to write out your own birth certificate for it
B	oh really?
A	and name it and they print it off and let you send take it home with you and
B	ah
A	erm so it's quite a good little thing really ain't it for em?
C	mm
B	and they sew it all up there for you?
A	yeah they do it all there
C	they they sort of tie it they
B	yeah
A	it's got stitching in it and they just literally knot pull it tight and knot it up don't they?
C	mm
B	oh yeah obviously good at it whatever they do
A	it's got a special bar code inside it so if it ever gets lost it goes back to Build-A-Bear they'll scan it and it can work out who it belongs to
B	oh really?
C	yeah
B	oh wow how much is it to build a bear like this then?
C	that depends
A	bear on its own was sixteen pound weren't it?
B	and then you gotta buy its outfits
A	yeah she she spent was it
A	but then she did have money of her own
B	yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	your mum gave her some as well so and that i's including the two outfits and the bows and
B	it's not just something you can do willy-nilly and I mean obviously she loves it it's a nice teddy as well I mean as you said they it makes a whole thing out of it then if they're telling it secrets and whatnot as well
A	yeah
B	mm
A	I mean last year she went there for her birthday last year didn't you? cos we you you we you took her out didn't you?
C	yeah
A	and she got a Pudsey one
B	oh yeah
A	cos she wanted to do some money for
B	oh yeah ah
A	but she bought it out of her own birthday money so
B	that's ah that's what she
A	well like I said it's I don't she they're computer games otherwise she doesn't really do that
B	no
A	although she has asked for a game for her DS it's not very often she asks but she does want a game this year
C	we went to Smith's first didn't we?
A	that's right yeah
C	and then we went to Build-A-Bear after
A	and out of her birthday money for last year she bought her sister erm a toy as well so
B	oh did she?
A	she's very sweet like that most of the time
B	she's quite good with
C	she's brilliant with
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	she's a really good big sister
B	yeah
A	and I think she puts up
B	yeah
A	she can be a right I mean she hits her she pulls her hair she really but she snatches her stuff all the time and but
B	no
A	cos I normally get the mum she's nicked my like her doll yesterday
B	but she doesn't retaliate just don't get violent
A	but she won't push her back she won't
B	the most common reaction isn't it? where they fight and scratch each other
A	yeah she's never snatched she won't snatch it back
B	oh
A	nothing like that
B	that's good isn't it?
A	but I don't know how long it will last for
B	no
A	as
B	and once she's a bit bigger
A	yeah
B	she stops seeing her as a baby
A	yeah it might be a bit different
C	when
A	such a git
B	yeah
A	such a turd
B	such a madam
C	she'll know not not to do it so
B	until until they're teenagers
A	but then
B	yeah that's good
A	she's always teaching her to like she'll she'll teach her to count
B	yeah
A	she's taught her to count to five
B	that's good
A	when they're going down the stairs they have to hold hands and she's like one two
B	ah how cute is that?
A	I'm trying to get her to teach her to go toilet as well
B	yeah
A	but it's not working
A	well
B	oh really?
A	she even sits on the potty and pulls her knickers down to show
B	oh yeah
B	interest to do it
A	if I take her nappy off now say put knickers on use a big it means the big girl toilet no she'll cry
B	oh
A	so I said we'll just leave it a couple of months and try again
B	yeah
A	I mean she's not even two and a half yet is she? so it's not such a rush
B	no
A	but like I said to your mum I was only trying to do it now while the good weather's here cos obviously she can run around in a T-shirt and it doesn't matter does it
B	yeah yeah
A	when it's freezing cold
B	she only turned two in April didn't she?
A	May
B	May
A	yeah so
B	ah so it's only just been her birthday yeah
A	yeah I just wanted to try it while she was er while it was summer
B	summer yeah
A	cos obviously you can run around in just a pair of knickers and a T-shirt or a vest
B	no yeah
A	and if she doesn't have a nappy on she'll tiddle wherever she likes
B	yeah
A	over my bedroom carpet
B	does she?
A	over the rug in the front room
A	so if she's not if she's got a nappy on if she hasn't got a nappy on on the rare occasions she doesn't it I pull the carpet up now
B	yeah yeah
A	I like to just take the rug up
B	that's a good idea
A	but it's only laminate it's easy to clear up on the laminate
B	definitely yeah
B	what? you need
C	this is my new
B	oh I know
C	how good is that?
B	whatever
A	I told you
C	my glasses up
A	nothing make a lady happier than a new kitchen toy
A	that's it
B	steaming her glasses of even
C	new kitchen gadget now to get back into
