A	erm how long do you think it's gonna be?
B	well
A	oh right
B	is that too long?
A	no I'm just wondering I'm quite hungry
B	oh right
A	we've got Talktalk internet now as well
B	have you?
A	yeah they came and put it in for us like the day after we moved in
B	well then how come you've gone with Talktalk then?
A	it's cheap the cheapest
B	so who did you have before?
A	BT
B	got you a starter
A	oh
B	well I'm not on I've not gone with them now and I haven't done in years
A	cos we used to always had them because like we just never changed
B	yeah look that looks alright
A	yeah
B	well that's what they rely on a lot of people don't
A	yeah
B	and so they don't look around and that's
A	and then but we were paying so much so we've got Talktalk and then he came this person and like sorted it
B	well yeah I told your mammy years ago that it's really cheap
A	yeah it's good
B	and er
A	and it works
B	of course it does I can watch films on the internet with it
A	but like he came this engineer
B	yeah
A	and then cos we got our box in the post like the the router
B	yeah
A	and erm he came to install the phone line and usually they install like the router for you as well and he didn't so I have to
B	oh right
A	follow the instructions in the box and I was like oh it's alright I mean they are cheaper and everything and mammy was like why did they not install it? and I'm like I've managed to do it it only took me five minutes
B	I just got mine in the post
A	yeah
B	and I just did it cos there's not much to install really you just I mean
A	cos on on BT they're always like don't attempt to install it yourself
B	oh really?
A	like we will come and do it for you
B	oh well that's why cos they wanna charge you so much you see
B	and make out that it's something special to do but you know you don't have to do much to put the router get the router sorted do you?
A	yeah
B	what so you're just getting the internet yeah?
A	yeah like we have to have the phone line to get the internet through
B	yeah
A	but we're not like plugging in our phone
B	well it's only another fiver for a phone line isn't it? to have a phone plugged in you know if you want a a line you what are you just paying for the phone line?
A	yeah so that we can have the internet through it but like we don't want the phone because whenever we've used the landline to make calls it's always worked out like more expensive
B	well no you you you pay
A	than the mobile because of our mobile package is really good and we can make
B	you only pay five pound and you call anything for free
A	no I mean but it's just the paying for just like no I mean like company numbers and stuff cos that's all we ring and company numbers
B	right
A	charge and it's the same as like
B	cos on the mobile they charge more don't they?
A	no they don't they er it's it's worse on well cos when we used the landline it was just as much because of the mobile package that we've got it's some of them they charge more
B	well I thought your mammy was saying she's been paying thirty pound to ring the gas
A	yeah because we were on the phone to them for like three three hours
B	yeah but if if you rang the landline
A	no it's just as bad because we rang
B	what in
A	no in
B	well that's probably cos of the package you have with BT
A	no because we were supposed to have free calls but all these numbers that we had to ring these companies were all exempt
B	oh why they were 0845 or something?
A	yeah they were all exempt so it just
B	oh right
A	works out just as well for us to just ring on the mobile
B	can you read that
A	er cook for eighteen to twenty minutes
B	yeah
A	er what's do you want temperature?
B	yeah gas mark six
A	two er two hundred degrees
B	gas mark
A	gas mark
B	so even you
A	six
B	struggle to read these things
A	cos it's crumpled
B	why do they do that?
A	it's crumpled
B	do you want erm
A	yeah what flavour is it?
B	oh oh
A	mangoes and passion
A	oh
B	do you want a few crisps to go with it?
A	yeah
B	is that glass alright?
A	yeah
B	why?
A	because
B	do you not like it where you are?
A	yeah we've been drinking and we've been like it tastes weird like
B	oh yeah?
A	yeah
B	cos this water was supposed to be really pure around here
A	yeah I don't know I think but it feels different as well like when I wash my hands
B	really?
A	yeah it's like when I put soap on my hands and I'm like washing my hands
B	mm
A	it's like I'm not washing the soap off but I have
B	strange
A	yeah I don't know
B	well the water in this area is meant to be it's meant to be really good
A	yeah it it's good
B	is what I've heard yeah maybe it's just cos it's not what you're used to
A	yeah it's probably just different
B	so I mean
A	yeah I just it's just changed so I'd say
B	there you are
A	oh right okay
B	coming in in a minute
A	no
B	shall I show you what what I've been looking at a couple of
A	oh yeah
B	a couple of options? I mean you can browse and see if you can find anything else if you're not keen on them
A	well we're lucky that there's still places to book
B	yeah fortunately I don't think the kids will be yet like the kids will
A	like mid July I think isn't it?
B	mm
A	oh right yeah
B	they said I can upgrade to a better caravan and make it a week where we're staying
A	mm
B	and I'll look
A	yeah
B	no it wasn't when we were in Scotland was it?
A	yeah it wasn't bad actually that caravan
B	it depends what bungalow type thing you get
A	yeah cos that could be cramped
B	you know some of them are not er great we were lucky in Scotland with that as well we had
A	yeah
B	a nice one
A	wow that was cool that was for like six people wasn't it?
B	mm we won't be getting one like I don't think
B	I know that's it you see
A	yeah
B	some of the caravans are they're great they're massive
A	mm
B	erm
A	have you fixed whatever was wrong with your internet with that re-stall?
B	well I've I've done it a few times and the problem is it keeps
A	doing it
B	even when I I changed the it's when I get an update so it kept updating and and then I kept changing it and eventually I was fed up so I thought right I'm gonna go into the control panel and say ask me before you install any upgrades
A	oh yeah yeah
B	so I did that and then it just does the bloody update when I shut down again
B	so then I've I've shut it off and it said it's not recommended that you don't have updates but for temporarily until I you know get this sorted I've I've shut off
A	what is it doing?
B	so I don't get any updates any more
A	mm
B	and I've checked the updates it's putting down cos I was gonna look if it was something obvious and just delete that update
A	it's probably a bug in it or something I'm surprised no one's reported it
B	well no there's various things it could be cos it it's the it it's coming up DEP er the data execution prevention
A	mm
B	there's a programme in there that stops and they said you you may have when you when you say what could be the problem they say it could be when you when you run
A	mm
B	and you should install uninstall it but all the updates are from Windows from Microsoft
A	mm
B	so I don't I don't get it
A	mm
B	so I'll have to look a bit more in-depth so this is the only solution I could figure out er temporarily for now erm I mean I've got there's like free erm AVG security er thing and what have you on it so you would think if there
A	is it internet
B	something else
A	internet
B	yeah
A	Explorer is a rubbish browser
B	mm
A	get Google Chrome
B	yeah I was just
A	that's better
B	just thinking that today that might be a more better long term solution so I thought Google Chrome or Firefox or
A	like if you can help it like no
B	really?
A	I mean people do but it's quite slow and there's like stuff wrong with it and
B	mm
A	I don't have Internet Explorer
B	well I've not had problems with it before but I think that might be a a way of solving it
B	oh really?
A	mm
B	mm I've not heard of that
A	yeah but the new like
A	the new like Windows eight they've got has got so many problems with it
B	mm
A	and erm like most people have that one and they said they're like oh yeah Windows ten you can have it for free because it was
B	oh right I wonder if they'll give it me or if it's just if you've eight
A	yeah I dunno I think you might get it
B	mm
A	I don't know if you want it though it looks really different like I don't
B	yeah
A	I don't know how to work it
B	oh right
A	it's like you know on like your smartphone where you have like apps?
B	mm
A	and it's like you click them but on Windows eight they didn't have a start menu but in Windows ten they've brought the start menu back so it's a bit easier to navigate
B	oh right
A	but yeah in Windows eight there was no start menu and people were like what am I doing?
B	yeah you'd think before doing updates like that they'd consult people
A	file task
B	and I'm gonna get those chips in cos they take half an hour
A	uhu
B	got multiple problems with your computer
A	yeah and it says
B	that doesn't sound good does it?
A	it's probably you er erm disabling all those updates or something
B	maybe it's coming from them because it's thinking well why can't we send these updates? he's got a problem
A	I'm gonna eat all these crisps
B	do you want more?
A	what?
A	do you know I was just thinking the other day how long it has been since I had some Doritos and I was like I really want some Doritos and here we are
B	oh that's good isn't it?
A	yeah yeah
B	I don't get them often but they they are tasty and they
A	I had one of those
B	they're quite addictive aren't they?
A	I had one of those USB like mobile stick things
B	mm
A	and the internet went quite fast
B	yeah that's what I was thinking and it might
A	it's not like it wasn't a good value for money
B	oh right
A	but I dunno you could try it
B	mm
A	but it does kind of work out more expensive like if you ever want to use
B	oh right
A	Skype or anything
B	oh right yeah I'm better sticking to
A	like there would be like no way you could use Skype
B	mm
B	install the
A	probably
B	now let's see security centre
A	yeah who knows what it's doing? just get Chrome you've got Chrome
B	yeah I've not I've not installed it though
A	how's it there then? is it just like do you have to?
B	well it's probably an option if I
A	do you think?
B	right click I think so yeah it doesn't I've took it off anyway
A	did you ever click it?
B	probably er I may not have tried it no
A	what to? it'll be installed
B	oh right
A	nothing's happening yeah
B	just leave it to
A	why is your laptop this like how old is your laptop?
B	well I don't know it's er
A	that wallpaper I put that on for you when your laptop was like brand new within like the first I don't know when you got it and you've still got it
B	mm
B	it must be six seven years I think this
A	yeah
B	mustn't it? so it's done alright hasn't it that?
A	mm
A	it is quite slow
B	well it's not it's been working since I've stopped those updates
B	it's been really great
A	well it's slow now
B	well yeah it's taking a while to
B	yeah that's what it's saying cos I've turned it off and that's what it wants to bring to my
A	yeah look
B	attention and it thinks
A	you've got Chrome
B	oh right so shall I just start using that?
A	well yeah what is it just Internet Explorer that keeps messing up?
B	well I don't know it's not it well well I'll find out cos
A	mm
B	to go
A	oh
B	on the internet and let them do the updates again
A	mm
B	and it doesn't bring it up then I
A	cos I think Internet Explorer is sometimes quite out of date so maybe it's just not compatible with the new software
B	possibly yeah
A	mm
B	might er put the er updates on again and then when I try to get on the internet try Chrome and see if that makes a difference
A	mm
B	right what time have I put those things in?
A	does it?
B	it's twenty-five to eight do you need to?
A	mm?
B	shall I put these somewhere for you? if you want your bag beside you it's alright I'll give it you back
A	got my phone in it
B	oh right okay
A	and all my valuables and like treasures oh no wrong one
B	have you got treasures?
A	yeah
B	do you want another drink and crisps? it's gonna be half an hour
A	er I don't know maybe
B	how many phones have you got?
A	one of them's my Iphone
B	oh right
A	I was just looking at something on it
B	well some people do
A	and I've got my business phone and then I've got a fourth phone that's just my private phone for like playing games on
B	some people I never understand when people
A	I can understand when people have a personal and a business phone
B	mm
B	yeah yeah
A	where's this? Cornwall?
B	yeah don't you know? that's where we're going
A	yeah I know I just I wasn't sure
A	if you it was like if we were going somewhere nearby
B	oh right
A	mm
B	so where we're staying in the first bit we might kind of explore the south part and then
A	mm
B	use that to go up to the north and we might pop into kind of the bottom end of Devon as well
A	mm
B	cos it's kind of the top end this that's if we get we're going to this one
A	pets go free would you have to
B	depends
A	pay for
B	yes did you? yeah
A	pets?
B	cos a lot of them say twenty thirty pound to add a pet onto them
A	what?
B	why is it small?
A	yeah someone was saying to me at erm
B	the ashes
A	we're taking the ashes with us
B	fuck
A	and she was just like that's really weird
B	she said that to him?
A	no she was thinking it
B	oh right
A	she was just like oh
B	so what did she say?
A	she just kind of was like oh right
B	well fancy saying that anyway
A	I know to the person in the shop like
B	well hang on
B	oh
A	extension
B	where's that?
A	I thought you just
B	in the pop-up message where's the pop up message that appears when you open the browser? if Google Chrome is currently running you may first need to restart it for more information
A	that's a I've never had anything like that happen
B	no this is
A	mm
B	checks websites if they're safe or not
A	mm
B	and it's installed on the internet browser it's it's it comes with the bank it
A	mm
B	safe online and it says there's also the additional thing if you want to make a ensure a website's safe you can click on it erm
A	yeah
B	did you see a pop-up thing?
A	no
B	enable extension in the pop-up message
A	what so it won't come up?
B	right
A	oh cos it wants to
A	run this
B	yeah
A	safe programme
B	mm
A	yeah what are your new neighbours like?
B	er one's a a man who's upstairs and he his children
A	oh really?
B	come and stay
A	is there any?
B	and it's a different man upstairs yeah
A	oh
B	and I've not really seen them much I don't know but I think it's a woman
A	normal
B	normal I've spoken to him a few times upstairs
B	well yeah there was
B	all around here really
A	yeah
B	and the people who've moved in since seem to be like people who not all of them but some people they they have jobs and things well I think
B	the majority of people here they don't work
A	yeah
B	how did you get this up? did you double click it?
A	yeah must have done
B	oh leave it then for now cos
A	well nothing it's not even loading though like it oh
B	yeah
A	wow
B	yeah you see
A	that's slow
B	so
A	there's no pop-up
B	oh there's a a
A	where?
B	let me close one of these
A	that's bookmarks
B	what's this? it's got apps?
A	apps
B	there was something when it first come on wasn't there?
A	yeah but it's I didn't remember
B	there there
A	there
B	enable extension
A	yeah
B	yeah?
A	mm
B	are your feet not cold on this floor?
A	no
B	mm
A	do you have slippers?
B	yeah
A	do you wear them?
B	yeah
A	oh
B	why do you want some slippers?
A	no
B	I might have
A	because because I I always walk round at home with bare feet and then
B	do you?
A	grandma's always like the
B	I think when you're young I you know well it's probably like and that's while you
A	because
B	as much
A	because she's she's always like you're gonna catch a cold well like when you're older you'll be you'll regret doing this because
A	your bones will be aching
A	and I'm just like right cos she's like you can catch such a bad cold and then you won't be able to walk because it's like some kind of a foot cold or something
B	mm yeah well if you don't feel cold then it's fine isn't it?
B	what's that? oh just okay then that can
A	I don't know maybe she's making it up
B	well your grandma seems to have an
B	she's made you all go round frightened right so looking at this one
A	mm
A	oh a manor
B	yeah it sounds impressive doesn't it? but
B	comfortable bungalow
A	mm
B	one double with one twin bath and overhead shower double glazed for year round breaks no pets now the thing is this starts on the eleventh and we're out of the other place at the tenth so we'd have to do what we did in Scotland you know and find a bed and breakfast for
B	but it it extends the stay as well cos we'll be going on the Monday the sixth
A	mm
B	and this I think the last day is probably the sixteenth then so it's like a twelve day break or something
A	that was like such a are we gonna find one? where are we gonna stay?
B	no we found it alright it was okay that wasn't it?
A	yeah I know but
B	I mean we won't have a problem finding somewhere I'll even stay in the caravan can we stay another night? and they probably don't do that cos it might be fully booked and they probably don't rent out for one night but I can always ask them if we paid them a bit more so erm
A	oh
B	because it
A	it's quite nice
B	oh it is
A	oh
B	so it's like on a holiday park with lots of
A	mm
A	it's strange that isn't it them holiday parks with all these just bungalows like next to each other it just looks weird
B	yeah I mean they have they have all different stuff lodges
A	mm
B	and all kinds of things but if it's like that
A	mm
B	that looks alright doesn't it?
A	yeah
B	it looks spacious it looks like it's probably quite a small TV but what I might do cos I don't know if there's a DV or it says TV DVD
A	mm
B	but just in case I might bring this laptop and I know it's a small screen but if we wanna watch a film
A	mm
B	and there's no DVD we can always at least we have something rather than you know at night
B	there's not always something on telly so if it's like this that
A	mm
B	looks okay doesn't it?
A	I think we
B	choice of lodges villas apartments bungalows or cabins but we're going for the bungalow
A	mm
B	cos that's all that's come up really so the rest must be book er out I mean there is more further down but they're all dearer
A	mm
B	so that's kind of the price range
A	caravan
B	it seems it's that's a caravan
A	oh wide caravan
B	so that's probably
A	one double and two twin that's still quite big isn't it?
B	a twelve foot one
A	although er oh that's what we had in
B	no it's not one of those and that
A	in Scotland
B	that yeah it'll be similar to that though
A	cos I had an extra bed in mine didn't I?
B	yeah yeah
A	it's got a shower
B	that's what it said on the other though isn't it?
A	is that
A	is that the caravan?
B	that is nice that isn't it? why is it showing a picture of that one?
A	er is that a lodge?
B	well it says caravan though doesn't it?
A	yeah it says caravan but it's showing a picture of a
B	well it probably just
A	very nice looking lodge
B	well yeah probably is doesn't show you the caravan probably thinks well you know what
A	that's got a balcony and everything that lodge
B	yeah
A	or is that a cottage? a villa or an
B	oh I see oh have I clicked on a right thing? cos
A	caravan yeah it's just not showing you the caravan
B	yeah I clicked on view accommodation didn't I? accommodation
A	yeah
B	information yeah
A	mm
B	it's probably a lodge those type of ones aren't they? oh look archery
B	golf
A	do you know on that hill across from my house?
B	see I I think these pictures are quite standard
A	yeah
A	oh
A	yeah
A	you know on that hill across from my house
B	yeah
A	there's a golf course
B	yeah? yeah you thinking of joining?
A	no I was I was like I saw someone pulling something behind them and I'm like what are they doing? and they were playing golf on the hill
B	oh a golf buggy yeah so the these are it probably is those big they are probably a a lodge or a bungalow although
A	mm
B	we're in a bungalow they're probably a lodge or a villa aren't they?
A	mm
B	cos it look at the the rooms look much nicer don't they?
A	no that's a a villa or something
B	that's a lodge that but well how come it looks square there?
A	cabin it's a cabin
B	oh is it?
A	yeah that's not a caravan
B	mm
A	it's got a porch
B	well some caravans have those attached to them
A	do they?
B	yeah
A	well I've not seen the caravan so yeah probably
B	well
A	that bungalow looks nice doesn't it?
B	well I don't know it looks quite basic
B	it looks alright but we er we just want somewhere that's reasonable cos
A	mm
B	we're not gonna be in we're gonna be there the morning and and the evening
A	mm
B	and all day we're gonna be out so it's not something we're gonna be spending ages in
A	mm
B	yeah I don't why is it not showing you a picture of the caravan?
A	oh is it not in yet?
B	well I er those chips had to be on a bit longer than the pizza so
A	mammy just said that she's been to buy Polyfilla
B	oh right
A	yeah it looks a bit nice well not that a caravan is not nice but
B	no we're not gonna see a picture of it are we really?
B	I mean it's odd isn't it?
A	mm
B	okay so there's this one
A	mm
B	how do you do a new tab in this Chrome is it this?
A	that yeah
B	oh it's already
B	oh it is Google
A	like Google please show me Google
B	wonder if
A	and google Google
B	I wonder what would have happened it
A	it
B	have got confused
A	no it would come up with searches lots of Google I've done it before
B	oh right
B	yeah
A	it Google Chrome like just typing in uses Google cos it's Google's search engine
B	yeah
A	browser
B	so this one it looks like a nice location
A	mm
B	erm
A	mm
B	let me just put in
A	I like the way it says pet friendly what other pets are gonna bring other than a dog?
B	a cat?
A	well I suppose if you've got a cat that walks on a lead but
B	okay so these are chalets
A	oh
B	right what's come up now?
A	none of your properties matched our
B	oh
A	of our properties match your search please try again
B	it had them earlier
A	maybe they've gone
B	none of our properties match your search
A	mm
B	well all I did was put in the date
A	no you've put number of nights
B	no hang on what's that? it's the fifteenth of the sixth
B	oh
A	refine your search
B	where is that?
A	what do you want?
B	oh you put on these?
A	mm
B	well it doesn't really matter does it?
A	no
B	just put I want a oh there we go
A	oh there we go
B	so erm
A	mm
B	can't see it can you?
A	no you can't do it
B	must be cheapest first maybe the cheaper ones have gone
A	electricity included
B	mm
A	I'd be worried if it wasn't
B	well some of them have meters don't they?
A	oh
B	I mean people like
A	most of them say
B	and they're a bit dearer than I saw earlier and they oh here we are here's one three five six
B	looks like a shed doesn't it?
