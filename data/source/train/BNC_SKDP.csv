C	and the bone of the joint with

B	yeah can't afford it
C	oh
B	once we finish off paying
C	yeah yeah
B	well we have a number
C	yeah I mean yeah
B	we have like
C	yeah
B	a mortgage account
C	yeah
B	to get the mortgage
C	no but I think that's a good idea because you sort of
C	learnt you've learnt to live without it
B	yeah exactly
C	and er if you carry on then you'll then find you've got a sum of money
B	and
A	shut up
C	I shall go back to the
A	yeah
C	the log burner
B	mama would you like a bit of tablet?
C	erm
B	that's our pudding
C	right
A	you mean death by tablet?
B	death by tablet
A	oh I don't wanna do this now
A	it's really strong
B	well they are
A	hurry up
A	is there anything left on the table? there's my wine
B	frying pan three things on the stove the work surface is quite clean because of what I've done
A	he hasn't had his chicken
B	for reasons he hasn't specified
A	is he on hunger strike because being force fed yesterday?
B	he might indeed be making a point
A	been on the phone to Esther Rantzen
A	yeah
B	the friends of British Waterways
B	RNLI
A	yes
B	the friends of Thames pathway
A	yeah
B	there's some tablet mama
C	right thank you darling
B	do you want some more wine?
C	oh no thank you
B	death by tablet?
A	mm I'm not sure I'm ready to die just yet
A	lovely though it is
A	oh I'm full
C	it's a nice antidote of
C	whatever that was antidote is the wrong word it's a nice
A	contrast?
C	contrast that'll do beautifully yes
C	yes it is very actually it's a very good tablet that
B	aye
C	I'm erm
A	chauffeur car?
C	yes oh yes we collected by chauffeur car to take to take us to Southampton
B	I couldn't resist it
A	oh
C	twelve twenty and it also says you know that there can be no change in their timing they've all been fitted in I actually think twelve if I were going to Southampton for a departure at four PM I'd be setting off a lot earlier than twelve twenty but it's up to them
A	yeah
C	but then
A	well
C	talk about to the minute but we'll we'll be well
B	same car or two cars?
C	oh no the I'm sure it'll be a big people carrier sort of thing for the three of us
B	no it's each each er board member
C	well er yeah given that we're coming from the same address I'm sure
B	mm there may be two cars I reckon
C	you think so?
B	uhu it's all factored into your ticket price and
C	yeah
B	please remove those now
C	I'll be a bit alarmed to see
B	uhu
A	they'll probably arrive together
C	yeah no I won't like that
A	do you want another one?
B	no I've had two bits aren't you going to have a bit?
A	no I'm resisting
C	mm
B	yeah but then why they're timed differently you would have thought
C	you'd think they would have put two and two together
B	the metrics say
C	yeah
C	yeah
B	but from this point A to B
C	yeah
B	you collect A at
C	twelve ten
B	twelve ten
C	or something or other yeah
B	in which case anyone leaving from
C	yeah
B	collected at twelve ten not
C	yeah
B	ten minutes later
C	yeah
B	but if you don't make it the boat sails on
C	they've got they are responsible for getting us to the ship
B	are they? then they fly you though if they if they don't get you there
C	yeah they they'd have to wouldn't they? yeah
B	uhu
C	and they left hours before they needed
B	mm
C	to get to Southampton for the Isle of Wight ferry and they never made it
B	blimey
C	they completely missed it because they were they were erm gridlocked in their car they were taking their car across the Isle of Wight as well the reason being that there were two big cruise ships these are two four thousand passengers things and if you've got something like seven eight thousand passengers disembarking
B	uhu
C	and moving out of Southampton at the same as seven or eight thousand are embarking you really have a major problem in Southampton
B	good my dear
C	it it was I mean it was a lovely leg of lamb but you cooked it absolutely superbly
B	uhu thank you
A	the tablet's amazing I just had a piece
C	it's good actually isn't it?
A	mm
A	sugar
B	that's the problem
C	yeah
A	it would be good with a Baileys
C	ah it would
A	mm
C	mm
A	what are you doing tomorrow?
C	well I was gonna say when what I've already said to
C	till about three
A	ah
C	er I'll set off you know I don't want to be setting off much later than three mainly because I think much later
A	oh
C	than that traffic will be like
A	just remind me again when you're leaving
C	some time after three
A	afternoon
C	tomorrow uhu mm so if you want to go anywhere at all in the morning to
A	I ought to work tomorrow
C	have you?
A	but
B	no
C	do you want to get another bag of coal and things like that?
B	no can't afford it now
C	well would you like me to get you a bag of coal?
B	no it's alright mama
C	well you haven't got how much do you have?
B	just that bag
C	yeah
C	no
B	or your roll neck
C	no I've got three sweaters on
A	oh that's your body temperature
C	yeah
A	unlike mine
C	two two cashmere and and this which is
A	gosh I would be very sweaty in that
C	yeah I mean I'm not the least
A	mm
C	I'm I'm very comfortable but that's that's it even my nose is quite warm which is quite rare
A	I've got this app on that I've put on our new tablet which is a workout app
A	boy does it make you sweat
C	does it really?
A	mm yeah it's supposed to be beginners but it's like woah
C	yeah
A	it's really tough
C	what sort of things?
A	erm like like this
C	oh dear
A	only she's doing it like really well with the leg
B	she does do it well
A	right out there
C	very straight
B	her bottom's in the right position
C	and how long do you do it
A	I've only put the ten you can put it to whatever you want
C	right
A	it's really good actually it's a really good design but er you have to be fit to start with to do it
C	yeah yeah
A	and erm I just did a ten minute one and by the end of it it's like
C	you were dripping
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	it's good to sweat though but oh really does
C	yeah talking of being fit you know Eddie Izzard?
B	isn't it crazy
C	yeah ran twenty-seven marathons in twenty-seven days a marathon is what? twenty-five miles
B	twenty-six I think it is
C	well let's call it twenty-five
B	mm okay
C	it's easier to multiply four per hundred so
A	bit mad
C	four seven
A	is he gonna drop dead?
C	nearly seven seven thousand miles he ran in twenty-
A	why?
C	to raise money
A	mm
C	er for charity actually which he did
A	mm
C	in oodles of course but he ended I actually saw it on the on the telly er the final the he arrived in in South Africa er I think they were all done in Africa actually erm part of it the reason why it was twenty-seven marathons it represented the twenty-seven years that Nelson Mandela was a prisoner
A	uhu
C	and it ended with him going up the steps to the Nelson Mandela monument where Mandela's granddaughter was waiting to greet him
A	mm
C	but you know you've just run seven thousand miles and the last thing you've got to do
A	is like oh
C	is go up a flight of steps
C	and actually he that was difficult for him
A	mm
C	yeah
A	it is something I've never done is run I can't do that
C	it's very bad for you so don't even don't get started
A	see I think it's really bad
C	yes terribly bad for your joints
A	it shakes up your body the whole
C	yeah
A	and it ruins
C	yeah
A	your bones and
C	yeah yeah fiendishly bad
A	it's not good for your body to be
C	no
A	shaken up the whole time like that
C	yeah yeah
A	it's alright little short bursts of aerobic exercise is fine but
C	yeah but for people who run day in day out on hard pavements
A	it's not natural
C	no
A	it's not good
C	joints are
A	no
C	you know
A	yeah
C	really going to be in a bad bad bad state
A	all worn out
C	yeah
A	also the whole gravity thing body being shaken
C	yeah
A	the whole time
C	yeah
A	I don't like anyway it's really boring as well I don't know how people do it
C	yeah
A	cos I'd just be like
C	yeah
A	I suppose they focus on some idea in their head or something or
C	they often listen to music actually don't they?
A	yeah
C	mind you the other boring thing is and we see it so often in
A	yeah
C	whatever the weather and it's
A	but I suppose that's quite good that
C	it's it makes you go walking
A	it makes them do it
C	yeah yeah
A	yeah and if you're inclined to be idle rather than get
C	yeah
A	take exercise then I think that's probably a really good thing cos
C	yeah
A	they would make you go out and
C	yeah but I think I'd rather find
C	alternative ways so that
A	yeah
C	I did have a bit of a choice one day or another
A	yeah
C	that I could
A	mm
C	opt out instead of this
A	yeah
C	great canine thing demanding to go for walkies
A	yeah it would be quite annoying
C	yeah
B	dunno dear
C	what are you watching at the minute?
B	just reading an article
C	mm oh
A	mm
B	involved a a quicksand a quicksand sort of ditch that was grey clay
A	mm
B	and involved
A	that's an anxiety dream
C	still still alright I'm thankful
A	yeah
C	to say but
A	it sounds quite an anxiety dream
C	yeah well I mean
A	someone sinking in quicksand and
C	yeah yeah
A	perhaps you're worried about her career prospects
C	I think she poor darling is actually
C	you know
A	what are you gonna do?
C	do
C	did I was telling
A	oh yeah?
C	she got a first
A	oh right yeah well done
C	yeah
A	yeah good
C	she of course said that doesn't mean to say I'm gonna get a first granny and is said no I'm well aware of that
A	but it's going to
C	but it does mean that you you are still
A	yeah
C	up there with the possibility so if you've come in with a
A	yeah exactly
C	third in a dissertation
A	yeah
C	you could rule out a two one and a first
A	yeah
C	straight away
A	mm
C	so and it's given her a lovely boost I mean she found it very onerous and daunting
A	yeah
C	erm but you know she's
A	mm
C	she's actually addressing this personal statement that she has to do with which is just five hundred words with you know much more positive outlook but the other lovely thing is that she and her two best girlfriends
A	oh that's good
C	yeah
A	mm
C	yeah
A	there's a reason to do well at on all the other aspects now
C	yes yes and and will really encourage her to
A	there's a possibility of
C	yeah yeah
A	something good at the end of it all
C	yeah
A	it is quite a big thing putting on a whole exhibition and
C	yeah yeah
A	really expensive as well
C	yeah yeah
A	everything has to be framed and
C	they have
A	uhu
C	actually
A	yeah
C	er and I think has introduced them to a lot of different
A	yeah
C	elements and things
A	mm
A	yeah
C	I think it's been a
A	yeah
C	pretty quickly
A	mm
C	but you know it's quite clear that the house is anything but energy efficient
A	mm
C	and from the from April the first of this year there is a legal requirement that landlords have to bring all their rented accommodation up to a certain level
A	and what is this level though?
C	in well and
A	and how are they defining level?
C	erm the the energy efficiency of the house actually
A	oh I see just the
C	yes yes
A	the energy
C	the energy efficiency of a house
A	yeah
C	and I'm quite sure that their house will be well below it because it is not
A	mm
C	an energy efficient house at all actually
A	have they got central heating then?
C	yeah yeah but it it's not
A	it's not working?
C	you know well you know the in fact he put in a new boiler or he got the no I think they put in a new boiler
A	mm
C	er they he had to repair the roof because somebody had found that there was a hole in the roof which is why the place was really so cold but er
A	well has it got insulation in the roof?
C	no no yeah
A	mm
C	so I'm sure it will be
A	well
B	unaware I bet that one next door is unaware but I bet his tenants are unaware as well
A	yeah and er
C	yeah
A	everyone's unaware
C	yeah
C	have you heard from
B	she must have had her baby mustn't
