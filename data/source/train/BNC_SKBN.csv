B	oh they're probably gonna burn it
A	well you know like what do hairdressers do with all the extra hair that they have?
B	I dunno actually
A	it must be really weird
C	if you put it around the garden it keeps cats away
B	really?
C	yeah
A	is that like leaving bottles of water so the dogs don't crap on your lawn?
C	why would that work?
A	oh it's how they do it in New Zealand they
C	really?
A	just take a clear bottle of water
C	yeah?
A	like a full bottle of water
C	yeah
A	and just lay it out on the grass
C	yeah
A	and dogs won't piss there
C	why?
A	or shit there I dunno
C	that's amazing
A	I don't know but that's how that's what happens
C	but maybe they
A	if you don't want any
A	don't want a dog to crap on your lawn that's what you should do
C	put a plastic bottle of water
[ANNOTATION]	Person C it is good to bring water in the plastic bottle	Neutral
A	just put a plastic bottle of water out
C	oh my god that's amazing
A	yeah
B	I don't think it's quite a tried and tested method of that though so
C	I wish it were would
A	oh it is it's well they use it everywhere
C	but how do they deal deal with cats then?
A	oh cats you just shoot
B	yeah handgun
A	well if there er if there's a cat around you've got gotta look for the witches don't you? so
B	mm
C	well you know what I did to keep the slugs away which worked?
B	what?
C	I made a
[ANNOTATION]	Person C said he put the slugs away	Entailment
A	salt them
C	no I tried that but then
A	yeah
C	you need a lot of salt right and you have to confine them and then kill them with salt which is not very pleasant
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Person B agrees with Person C that they have to kill them by salt	Entailment
C	and I filled it with ash
B	oh yeah?
C	cos I
B	that would do it
C	I was thinking they can't cross
A	and they can't cross over
C	and it worked
A	the dry ash thing
[ANNOTATION]	Person A said they could not cross over and that works	Neutral
C	yeah it worked
A	hey that's a great idea
C	yeah
A	brilliant
C	put beer in and they fall in and drown and it's like but I don't want them
A	yeah I know you don't want
C	I don't wanna deal with them
A	don't want them at all
[ANNOTATION]	Person A dont want them	Neutral
B	yeah
C	I just don't want them to come here
A	well of course they're not gonna
C	no
A	just get clogged up
C	yeah it worked
A	it would be like
B	so they
[ANNOTATION]	Person B think that why clog happened	Neutral
A	they'll be making concrete on their foot
B	so they just slug off
C	yeah
B	the other way
C	yeah it worked
