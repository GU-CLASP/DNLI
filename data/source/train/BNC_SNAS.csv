B	but like I used to go on it and like it's like basically forums for people like talking about drugs and being like
A	yeah like actually no one's ever died from drugs
B	yeah no one's
A	I never used to
B	mm
A	mm
A	no
B	quite a lot of the ecstasy deaths are like
A	rat poison
B	actually a bad a pill
A	really?
B	erm
A	I literally can't see myself taking drugs ever again
B	like you know you took
A	coke yeah
B	I think that's just cos like it is peer pressure like
A	what like have a line have a line?
B	no
B	it was like
A	she made you do it didn't she?
B	just kept mentioning it like oh I've got two grams of coke wow so like
A	really?
B	and then er she was like oh do you want some? and I took I didn't
A	yeah you had the freak out didn't you?
B	mm
A	I don't know how you drink though
B	what even cos it's bad for my psoriasis?
A	no just in my head we have a really similar reaction to drugs and like for me we erm alcohol is just as bad like it makes me feel really depressed
B	it it I feel I dunno it used to it really used to like awfully depressed
A	mm
B	mm
A	do you not find not going out is fine?
B	yeah but like on my birthday
A	yeah
B	like if I didn't drink that day and it's like a picnic and everyone's just wanting to get drunk
A	mm
B	it would have just been me like wanting to go home early
A	home early?
B	no early like
B	no it would have been me like enjoying it for a bit and then everyone getting drunk and then
A	yeah but I always think that but then it's like I forget as soon as I drink I'm not happy so it's like I may as well be home
B	but I think
A	as in
B	the moment you stop you're doomed like you have to like basically you have to keep yourself you have to either be getting the same amount of drunk or drunker the moment you
A	mm
B	and then it's then you start cos yeah when I like come down from drinking
A	mm
B	I start
A	mm
B	it's like you have to keep like poisoning yourself
A	and then until you fall asleep
B	yeah yeah so like
A	yeah but then
B	and I get this thing like
A	yeah
B	I just stop for a bit too long and then suddenly I like can't
A	mm
B	oh that's awful but I know some people could like
A	mm
B	or like do something else and then
A	even the word like drinking
B	but I think for me it's like
A	mm
B	it's like I'm not like oh I'm so like I'm doing it for her but like her reaction when I was like oh I'm drinking now it's like they actually want to have dinner with you whereas when you're not
A	no but
B	you like they they it's like a chore
A	mm
B	mm
A	cos like whenever
B	but that's what I mean it's like
A	yeah
B	but the thing is like
A	well
B	and
A	yeah but like I think if you enjoy it
B	also like apart from India like every culture does have a drinking culture
A	mm
B	but you know er the other thing I think it is culturally is like if you
A	yeah
B	if you don't get that much time with people say if I only have like two hours like to meet someone
A	yeah
B	if you have two hours and you have a drink you get like to a deeper level a lot quicker in terms of like a friendlier level
A	but isn't that like a horrible thing? it's like we're so overworked we have to like take this poison so we can like feel like we connect on a deep level when actually we're like dumbing ourselves down I just and like I don't know I just think there's no good in it cos like sometimes I'm like oh yeah drinking like join in but then like as soon as you remember like look at white most white middle aged people like their faces their noses their skin their blood it's like from drinking that's why they're so like bloated and like desensitised
B	I don't think it is from drinking I think it's from
A	er
A	every time you eat you every time you drink your brain cells die you get stupider
B	is that true?
A	yeah every time you drink er it drinking is like very mild brain damage every time you drink you your brain cells
B	even like a glass of wine?
A	yeah like obviously like a glass of red wine like people say it's good for you for some there are some benefits for your blood and stuff
B	the thing is I'm like the worst type of drinker cos I don't really drink but when I drink I like binge drink and they say that that's the worst type cos if you're someone who just like likes a glass of wine it's actually fine because you're not doing it to get drunk but I don't really particularly want like one glass of wine
A	yeah
B	it's like either I'm drinking or I'm not
A	I just feel horrible when I'm drinking and like the only time I feel
B	it does make you feel like really like chubby and like
A	it makes me feel awful in every way
B	you you know like if you're taking drugs your eyes go like big and you feel like
A	yeah you're like
B	you go like pixie
A	yeah you feel like yeah
B	but when you're drinking it's like the opposite you like become like piggy and you're like oh
A	yeah and you become like such a like big white human like bit fatty fat fat
B	mm see I
A	with
B	yeah
A	you shouldn't do it
B	mm
A	the it's such bullshit that we are in a society it's like oh but you're a drag if you don't it's like well then the society can fuck off and you'll
B	yeah but the thing is like
A	you develop yourself in a
B	I completely understand and I'm like I don't care that you don't drink obviously
A	yeah
B	I'm not gonna judge you
A	how is she?
B	I'd like meet up with a friend for a bit and we like sit and er you can tell like I could feel that they weren't having a good time a lot of the time
A	but that's why I don't
B	unless it's like in the day and it's obviously a time for a cup of tea but like you feel like a drag and you are a drag to everyone and it was just not fun for me cos I was like I always felt like I'd have to like leave
A	mm
B	I would have to be like make an excuse cos I just felt like I was like it was a shit atmosphere and if it was one to one
A	that's how I feel
B	then they wouldn't wanna have a beer and then it's like then they do and you're drinking water
A	and then they like resent it
B	and they
A	yeah and they feel judged but like
B	yeah and it's like
A	so like hence not going out much
B	and you get loads of questions like oh what do you wanna do now? or like
A	yeah I know it's like
B	or like like on Friday night
A	oh do you mind if I have that joint? and you're like it's fine
B	yeah like on Friday night
A	and they're like oh
B	if I met up with if
A	yeah but what and that's so
B	but instead we'd like started drinking straight away and like
A	but do you not think like? it's all very well saying all these like things like it's good for but it's like look at the physics the science it kills your brain cells it makes you slow it slows reactions it makes you less intelligent and desensitised and there is no way that can be a good thing
B	I think at the
A	yes in the moment you might feel good but how can you defend it? how can you defend it? I just don't get it
B	but I think it depends because
A	yeah
B	to like a binge every week a binge every week is still worse
A	no I don't it's different if it's like a hot chocolate in the evening drink
B	like a hot toddy
A	yeah but I think mum mum's like drinks it habitually like with dinner but she's like mad like we went out it's like it was like five do you remember in Chelsea? we're having like hummus and she can't
B	mm
A	I just think it's
B	but it's like a
A	they did
B	sometimes like and they'd always have a lot of wine with dinner and always
A	and look at them now they're like fat
A	I don't think you can for very long
B	but if you eat too much pasta you throw up
A	yeah but it is a poison
B	animals get animals like eat like fermented fruit and get drunk
A	no I think like if you live on a farm and make dandelion wine as like a ritual in the summer you can do it like very occasionally
B	why you don't drink I know
A	but it's a poison you can't even deny that maybe one glass of wine with dinner like red wine for like your system but like
B	but the thing is for me it is kind of like
A	mm
B	or somewhere or even like here and I wasn't like being as social I I
A	mm
B	like I wouldn't go to the supermarket and buy a bottle of wine for myself for like my house
A	yeah but you're putting at the end of the day you have to keep this body and this mind for the rest of your life like it's delusion it's just not truth food is different obviously you shouldn't be like a chocolate biscuit head yeah but and like I know tea is like not like extremely pure but
B	but the thing is I don't
A	it's delusion it's not reality
B	but do you to me like a processed like burger or like loads of processed biscuits it's like kind of the same body abuse for like
A	really?
B	maybe worse like beer is like
A	I don't at all
B	oh well a lot more of like
A	it came back
B	it came back like even though those were gluten free and dairy free
A	yeah but it's different like but it's not just body abuse it's not like it's mostly not about body abuse it's about also just running away from reality
B	but what about like it's okay that's like yeah maybe
A	I know like the feeling of enhancing reality it's like it's not enhancing
B	okay but maybe that's binge drinking which is different but I think like having like a cider or like
A	yeah I just think it's like a collective thing in our society it's just like running away and like
B	yeah like
A	it
B	dad was like oh you know AA Gill the food writer? I've heard he's really boring he like he doesn't even drink and and I was like and dad was like erm erm but other things too and I was like
A	yeah and it's like er also
B	but the thing is like I didn't used to like it at all like I used to hate it I used to hate that feeling but like you know the feeling when like your muscles go a bit relaxed and like you feel really relaxed after a drink?
A	you just you feel stupid
B	I think some are worse though I find white wine's the most like head confusion to me
A	like obviously chocolate biscuits stuff that's not good either but I think drinking's like a serious evil and it has been like
B	but what do you think about like places like Russia where like they drink cos it's cold? it's like in the culture but it's not necessarily always bad
A	yeah I think that is different but then it's like Russia like life expectancy is really low there is a lot of violence a lot of abuse it's very dangerous right because they have alcoholics everywhere
B	yeah but so is India and they don't drink
A	no
B	that tastes like
A	what?
B	chemical
A	obviously I'm not saying oh if people don't drink there's no evils I just think that it it's an evil that you can easily eradicate and that's normalising our society
B	but do you think the same with drugs?
A	yeah
B	and weed?
A	yeah
B	I hate weed now I'm like I just think it's like the worst I think weed is also the worst thing like weed is like a really slow you're like it's not like you smoke and like with a pill I think it's like people who smoke weed they don't really notice it cos it's like a
A	that's what alcohol is for me alcohol and weed are like the same I think like really natural really natural like
B	I'm just checking the time it's it's our thing's at nine isn't it? our show?
A	yeah
B	it's not really eight is it?
A	yeah it's like eight in the morning
B	erm I don't know like I just feel like for me the way I felt the way I just I really didn't like feeling like a drag it was not fun and I know
A	I know but do you not think that's like giving in to people's evils?
B	yeah but the thing is it's like if I was
A	yeah you're like
B	I just can't keep up I I can't be be interested
A	I know but that's cos people are boring when they drink
B	then I just end up going to bed
A	do you not think people are just
B	but it's like you feel like a drag because you are a drag because
A	yeah
B	to them you like I I know when I'm not drinking and everyone's drinking I am a drag cos I know like so many times I went out with
A	yeah
B	and then I feel like you're just standing on the corner like watching everyone and waiting for them to like to get tired and get bored and they're not cos they're drinking
A	I know yeah but it's just
B	and then they come over and speak to you and like slur their words and expect you to like get on this deep conversation because you're not drinking you have all your barriers so you're not gonna talk about like all this really deep stuff straight away
A	yeah but it's not deep it's just mindless that's the thing people who drink delude themselves into thinking like oh it gives you like this deep thing it's like it's not deep it's you being an idiot you don't even remember what you said the
B	not necessarily like say with
A	like I obviously
B	me and
A	like I I understand like I just think it's really sad and I really I just think it's sad that it's literally it is every
B	are you making
A	no
B	are you making a card?
A	yeah but I only have one pair of scissors
B	okay
A	erm I just find it like
B	yeah have you heard
A	no
B	it's like erm
A	yeah it is it's any old excuse
B	it is but that's the thing it's
A	it's boring that people make you
B	it's boring cos you don't and
A	yeah but people make out that you're boring because you don't drink it's not it's like I don't know
B	it's
A	but society is boring
B	no I do believe you but
A	society is so boring you can't have a conversation with people the way that god made them just normal
B	but do you think it's also like?
A	cos that's people have got too desensitised and too thick and
B	no and I think it is that but then also it's a it's like genuinely from your age to my age I like if I had a drink I would suddenly feel like awful and like literally like I wanted to kill myself like I'd start getting really dark thoughts and I don't get it as bad now like I don't get dark thoughts from the drink I feel like chatty and happy
A	yeah but maybe it's like society's pressure's like got to you
B	no I think it's like also the whole thing is like drinking like exaggerates emotions like I'm not saying that you're only not drinking because you're like in a phase I'm just saying like
A	I don't think I am in a phase
B	maybe you need
A	far from it
B	to get drunk
A	no I don't that's like what drinking people say
B	no that is true
A	that's like the thing of our society that's like how people think
B	but the thing is I just found like
A	yeah
B	and I always thought like oh I was just young and then like so for a few years I've been
A	do you remember that you were drunk?
B	yeah and then I remembered like well yeah we used to get drunk and like not really drunk but like have like two
A	yeah
B	and then like since I started drinking like I've gone out and had fun whereas like all the time like like last year when I stayed in
A	in this yeah
B	and it's like basically
A	this society
B	the the thought is other people like they won't
A	yeah
B	but even at erm
A	yeah
B	and everyone was like plying me with alcohol and like loving me and I it was then you feel like everyone loves you and as much as like of course it's their
A	yeah but then like
B	it's
A	yeah that's like the name of the game for our society
B	it's the name of the game and like
A	that's the name of the game with all societies like take part in the masses even if you deep down know it's wrong or like be a the outsider and deal with like a more difficult life
B	yeah and that's the same with like
A	what are you gonna choose?
B	being a vegetarian
A	yeah
B	do you have another piece of paper like that?
A	yeah
B	down there
A	no it's true I don't know I just think and like weed alcohol drugs it's just such a trap of like the adult world and it's like so desensitised
B	yeah and then I always feel like it's like
A	but it's like
B	a chore for like for them to see you because you don't drink
A	yeah it's like they're it's like oh and a night of sacrifice and it's like
B	yeah I feel like they sacrifice
A	I'm gonna see
B	that's the thing it's literally feels like a sacrifice to them and I just I was just really sick of that cos I felt like people were like dropping in to see
A	yeah like the baby
B	the child that they come and baby and it's just like I just didn't wanna be that person like I I'm not saying that you shouldn't be that person I'm just
A	yeah but what is that person?
B	no I'm not
A	they are those people?
B	I I know I'm not saying like it like I agree at all
B	I'm just saying like that's why I stopped because I didn't enjoy that
A	yeah
B	and it's like I feel like now like people actually like will want me to come to a thing or like
B	like it's awful it really is awful
A	I dunno I just think you're like the drinkers are the ones it's like we'll see who's laughing when they're all like red nosed alcoholics with big
A	bulging bellies
B	I'll be like that I'm not
B	I'm not that into it
A	yeah I
B	oh can I use that?
A	I just really like being
B	what does
B	what shall I cut out for
B	but I think what
B	you what a good thing to do is like join
A	but I'm not like looking for social things now I'm quite I've got I dunno I'm used to like not doing social things I don't care
B	but I just think social life is so important I wish I had like made more effort to do more social things
A	yeah but I don't
B	but I'm just saying like I think that's the thing that you most remember out of life is like things with other people
A	yeah but that doesn't have to be the way society spells it out
B	that's why I really really hope that cos you know the like er a really high member of the police force said the other day it was on the radio that erm he'd much rather the high
A	yeah
B	I was like I really hope that like drugs don't become like drink cos there's one thing for it to be like this with drinking imagine if it was like this with drugs as well? it would be so awful
A	yeah but that's not that controversial so obviously he'd rather we're like hugging and like feeling depressed than like fighting and throwing up
B	mm yeah but
A	yeah
B	like one time on acid can send you mad but I don't think one time drinking
A	no
B	yeah weed could send you made after one
A	no
B	yeah weed can give you like psychosis
A	after one?
B	yeah
A	really?
B	well okay maybe not but like
B	I don't wanna cut out pictures of cake on this cos then she'll be like where's my cake?
A	no I know they're all cake there's nothing else for me to cut it's really annoying
A	mm I think
B	yeah
A	I hate it I think it's an ill of our society
B	see I don't think it's an ill
A	you don't think it's an ill of our
A	no
B	oh I'm getting really sleepy now
A	I'm really happy I've been really
B	you're happy?
A	yeah I've not
B	yeah
A	like last night I got home from work at one and I went to bed and I woke up at like nine
B	oh no I've I'm getting up early like I went yeah I went to bed at one last night and got up at like eight thirty this morning so that was good you know when you're like get you get like seven or eight hours but you don't overdo it
A	and you just don't need more and it's like I actually wouldn't be able to go back to bed
B	like India was erm and like yeah India is where we slept loads
A	yeah it was so hot
B	and but you know when also like there's not that much you wanna do so you just end up sleeping?

B	Jaipur is it?
A	if we're gonna do
B	can I have the scissors?
A	yeah and
A	like really?
B	India and a year abroad would be my idea of hell

B	I'd go to like Japan on a year abroad or like
A	no you can do so much man I can do so much there so
B	yeah but you're in India
A	no I got
