B	no yesterday afternoon
A	in the afternoon?
B	all afternoon they were there didn't you see them? the car the street was full of cars
A	yeah was that yesterday afternoon? I was in the house
B	I looked out the window I got up to look out the window seen all the cars and thought what's happening? and there was a line of bobbies queued up at the top you know by
A	mm
B	the
A	yeah
B	and the rest got out of cars here and they all went in the front door there was all cars there
A	well I thought that was the one they'd tried to get in that night because I I went to bed really late
B	well the one they tried to get in and that night they they got in because I they woke me up at half past four and I looked out the window and there was a big like er minibus type police car
A	yeah
B	you know the yellow and blue?
A	yeah
B	and I thought it was er paramedics at first cos all the doors were open
A	yeah
B	anyhow when I seen three fellas coming out I thought they're not paramedics they're bobbies them and they come out and got in a car
A	mm
B	and just after that the helicopter came didn't it?
A	mm
B	yeah now I went out at half past six yesterday morning to a car boot sale a car pulled in just up there on the corner pulled into our street and stayed there while I come out the house got in the car and left
A	yeah
B	cos I'm a nosy
A	you know I did I did at half one and I heard because
B	no this was not
A	so I I just wondered whether yesterday afternoon they they just came back because they they didn't have any success earlier?
B	well altogether I counted there were seventeen went into that house and what are they doing? a
A	yeah
B	I don't know if they all fitted in to tell you the truth
B	and I watched them for ages and ages cos
A	yesterday afternoon
B	well they were there until about half past four five o'clock they were in the area at least four a clear four hours didn't you see a lot of cars there?
B	they all come out and like I say most of them were in civvies
A	yeah
B	with the police jackets on you know like the black jackets?
A	yeah
B	and they all had belts with all the gear on
A	yeah
B	and er I seen them taking this big bag like that in
A	yeah
B	but the only thing they brought out was a bag like that and I thought it can't be drugs cos when they raided
A	mm
B	that house over there
A	mm
B	that
B	yeah
B	so it couldn't have been drugs and then what happened what got me
A	no I didn't well that's that's one of the reasons why I called in someone told me yesterday who's gonna move opposite
B	who?
A	there there's some people who were evicted from lower down the street
B	oh that's all we need someone
A	yes
B	being evicted they must have been evicted
A	yeah
B	for a reason
A	and they they wanted you know not is it next door two doors down that is owned by by somebody and they wanted to move in there and he said no sod it you're not gonna come into my house not here but they wanted to move back into the street because they
A	yeah
B	the house next door is empty and the house next door to that I don't know what's happened to the two
A	yeah
B	I believe the police were there the other week so
A	yeah they they
B	they're always
A	they wanted to get into one of those houses and the landlord said no I know who you are I'm not gonna have you
B	well this one it couldn't be this one because it belongs to a mutual and they've been here every day
A	yeah
B	putting plywoods and that
A	it's none of those houses
B	it's the one next door is empty
A	yeah
B	that was the one though
A	yeah
B	all he did was put wallpaper up and paint it and that was it
A	well that was a bit like what happened there cos always so yes they have been evicted and the the other ones they only moved out a week ago so suddenly this is taken and I remember before they moved in there were at least a handful of people and they had viewings and nobody wanted to move in until they moved in
B	that one they there
A	yeah next to
A	right
B	and then the
B	one of them was
A	oh yeah no those were those were the tenants
B	what like a priest?
A	yeah
B	no I don't mean the I mean
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	but
B	he had trainers on though all the while
A	yeah
B	he's got the right shoes with being a priest anyhow
A	yeah
B	and they have they just moved out?
A	they moved out just last week
B	it was up for sale for ages
A	yeah
B	and then the sign went up last week was it
A	yeah
B	to er let?
A	no it's let
B	yeah so that means someone's got it doesn't it?
A	yes and the end them two the it's the people who got evicted lower down the street and they have a pit bull terrier that has attacked dogs and people and he he's got a speedboat but doesn't do a day's work
B	yeah once you get someone who's been evicted they they won't like that her next door
A	no no this is we we're all
B	can you?
B	good on you let's hope you do then
A	and I I said you know
B	how can you put people in who's been evicted you know they're not gonna pay the rent?
A	well
A	well yeah
A	so I I sent an email to my councillor one of my three councillors as well saying what what can be done?
B	you sent one to each one of them not just the one?
A	well
B	oh he should do it
B	it's taken them weeks to put them in cos he's got that
A	well they the they had erm the bathroom window is already falling apart because he's done nothing to it
B	now oh no I've
A	yeah and it's no wonder nobody wants to move in because it's it's it's it's a horrid place I mean the people there they were not very demanding of stuff they kept themselves to themselves
B	oh yeah I mean
A	it's like
B	that was fair enough I mean
A	apart from the youngsters in the morning but you know that was
B	I never seen them
A	but they weren't you know they're not exactly demanding customers and if they think it's not good enough for them you can imagine what kind of people think yeah you either
B	ever since the
A	mm
B	or maybe no she lives around the corner
A	you called her jinx and that was ten years ago
B	the fella who moved in there that young lad he was dealing in drugs so
A	yeah
B	well he was a dealer so but you couldn't prove nothing on him like that and they had all kinds of cars parked everywhere here so
A	yeah
B	so
A	okay
B	well the first thing he's gonna do is rob everybody isn't he? if he's got a rottweiler like gotta keep it in the luxury it's used to haven't you? you can't feed it people's legs all the while like can you?
B	yeah
A	yeah I don't know
B	who?
A	just the owner
B	is that how much he paid for it fifty-eight?
A	and he wants seventy-four now so he doesn't make a loss seventy
B	do you know how much they offered me for this two years ago? seventy-five
A	yeah but this one's in good nick
B	that's what I mean and it's got a bathroom on the back
A	yeah
B	and that's all they are
A	yeah it's
B	too late in life to move really well
A	but that's that's I think it's he he can ask for that if if you put some money in but you know it's erm
B	christ it must be it must be a good house then if it's if it's seventy-four it's only a thousand pound less than this
A	well he he's in London where seventy-five is nothing for a property yeah you're probably
B	ah you pay that for a shed there
A	yeah exactly but you know this is this is
B	yeah yeah you're right there but I mean I I thought mine was alright you know with having a bathroom at the back and three bedrooms and I thought well er I did
A	yeah yeah he bought the in what two thousand and seven or eight
B	that that's right it was in
A	yeah
B	cos that fella one of them fellas has been in for ages
A	okay
B	and then one day she said hello to me and said my name and I said how do you know my frigging name?
B	anyhow I started talking to her after that and then when once when I went out she said I'm moving you know and I said oh why? she said oh I'm getting harassed by everybody and I thought well when the window cleaner came I told him and he said
B	is what he'd said so she must have been with the rent and all so
A	but that's the thing yeah if you
B	cos now the er they give it to you now don't they the rent? instead of paying it straight to the landlord you know if you're on the social like
A	yeah but it's but you only get three-quarters because of the rent is yeah I looked at the rent size of that for a similar house six hundred a week
B	where is this?
A	it's it's also a terraced house I don't know where it was
B	yeah
A	five hundred and eighty per month er not a week a month but it was the same setup two two bedrooms reception and bath
B	yeah and where was this here?

B	but they did away with the minimum wage didn't they? I mean there was a minimum wage in if you remember I don't know if you remember?
A	there wasn't one before Labour
[ANNOTATION]	Person A does not agree with Person B with minimum wage	Entailment
B	no there was but there was a minimum wage in the catering industry you know the barmen and staff like that?
A	yeah
B	they had a minimum wage nobody else did and as soon as they got in they took that minimum wage away and said you

A	and yeah
B	and a cleaner won't do all that take all the glasses and things away for you
A	this is why I stopped going
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Person B  take a conclusion that Person A was agreed with ot	Entailment
A	because I thought it's not like a pub and that's what you're getting you know you're not paying them
B	it's always been like that
A	so long as you don't get
B	it's not just now it's always been like that you know what I mean? cos I've always said about that about my daughter used to work in a pub in erm
A	yeah
B	students are outside?
A	yeah yeah the big one?
B	yeah
B	that's it and she worked she used to work in there and I used to say to her they they tell you your hours are seven until eleven I said but they're not
A	the same at Mcdonald's my girlfriend worked and it was the same yeah she said I couldn't I couldn't even imagine doing it now
B	no aha ah they've got you now and it's getting worse innit? without a doubt it's getting worse it's like they're always saying about they're always going on and just talking but I don't even listen to
A	yeah
B	I just have a
A	yeah
B	no really good wages I mean there's they don't I think it's twelve pound an hour the the fellas who work there I mean I don't know if
A	yeah yeah because obviously the agency got the money
B	that's right
A	yeah well then when when they had the big cable factory in er Widnes
B	and I read about them
A	yeah you can buy the Range Rover
B	what was the other one the other day? er they were talking on talking about if this fella they oh they got an IT expert in
A	mm
A	eight hundred pound a day he was on I thought he's only got to work one week a year and that's it he's made isn't he?
A	yeah
A	it's not about as much as a footballer
B	how can you manage on that? yeah but footballers are few and far between aren't they? they are entertaining and you're paying you know if you don't like it you don't go you know what I mean?
A	yeah
B	but erm I mean I think they're on too much money myself but cos
A	well yeah that's the thing if if sometimes you get to
B	yeah
A	and they are meant to be non not for profit but funnily enough all these bosses award contracts to their own firms
B	that's right
A	and and they then get money paid for really odd work
B	that's the god innit now money?
A	yeah
B	wherever you go the god is money
A	yeah
B	people don't work because they like the jobs now they they're working cos they need the money you don't hear many people saying oh it's a good job this like I mean there wasn't many good jobs either like but I should imagine it's better working in a shop than a car factory
A	mm
B	I mean the wages are different but I should imagine it's a better type job and when I worked in that Dunlop's
A	yeah
B	I mean what time is it?
A	it's just after twelve I don't want to detain you for too long
B	no I've got to go in a minute I've got to go out at erm one o'clock so I've got to get my dinner
A	yeah
B	I'd offer you some but I haven't got any
B	you'll have to go to the chippy
A	I I'll just have a sandwich
B	that's what I'm having a corned beef butty yeah so so I'll have to chase you anyhow
A	yeah
B	like I say cos I go and see my mate every week he's got diabetes he lives down by er
A	oh the the
B	you know where they're building all them
A	yeah
B	new buildings?
A	yeah
B	erm
A	yeah
B	yeah yeah he lives just down there there's a car park there that charges er fifty pence an hour or something and it's always chock-a-block
A	yeah
B	er warehouses and all
A	yeah
B	the supermarket
A	yeah yeah that one yeah I've seen I've seen the hole
B	yeah well
A	oh well that's good well er it's because you've got remember the the old warehouse that was turned into a gallery and they
B	that's right
A	went bust
B	yeah
A	but next door to it that is like a a pub-cum-bar-cum-something else now
B	and we've got a big brand new building haven't we by where the old church and they're doing
A	yeah
B	the church up as well now so
A	yeah
B	and that warehouse it looks like it's gonna get knocked down the way they're
A	mm
B	going to town on it
A	yeah
B	it's got all masts on it you know for the
A	yeah the the mobile phone masts
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	and that looks like that's gonna go cos I keep asking is that going? and he said I don't know he said but that cellar's not half going fucking deep
A	yeah
B	he said if they're gonna bury
A	they dig a bit deeper they'll find old old English kings you know like in
B	they won't live in Liverpool christ's sake
A	I mean I'm not I mean I'm not
B	around here
A	yeah oh I don't know fishermen maybe
B	I'll show you my leg
A	oh christ what have you done?
B	that's ten times better than what it was last week when I had the operation you see the
A	yeah
B	he said they have to do all the bone there as well
A	ooh christ
B	and I finish them tomorrow well that's all dead skin that now you know what I mean?
A	mm
B	so it had all big scabs on last week and on there it was in a terrible state
A	mm
B	come back so but it looks better to me now oh it was in a terrible state it had a big scab on this morning and I've washed it all off and it looks like it's gone now so it looks like just dead skin to me so it's alright now to what it was oh it looked terrible last week
A	yeah
B	and what happens I've caught it on the slide you see there?
A	yeah yeah
B	I caught it on something like a corner or something I I I knew I'd done something to it
A	yeah
B	and it come up and that's what caused that to go like that because they've always said you be careful with your leg he said if anything happens to it he said come here like
A	scary stuff yeah
A	mm
B	he said that's because you've got water on that as well and it builds up and the blisters come and they burst
A	so I suppose your footballing days are definitely over
B	and he said I could drowned from the inside if I didn't take water tablets yeah so if you ever hear me
A	oh no
B	get a pump out
A	don't say that
