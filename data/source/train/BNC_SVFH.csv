A	do The Hunger Games ever actually explain why
B	do the games?
A	do the games?
B	yeah
A	oh
B	have you seen or read the first one?
A	I've seen the first one
B	so at the beginning it's like it's the idea that
A	yeah
B	erm which was then stomped upon by the man
A	yeah
B	and they do the
A	yeah
B	and the
A	it's a bit stupid
B	yeah so they all live out in the
A	and it's and this er er going back going back to Battle Royale and like at least then with that one it was just kind of like
B	sort of like some euthanizing like
A	yeah they had like a thing with the you know the
B	yeah
A	and the game is called Battle Royale
B	yeah
A	apparently er when the Suzanne is it Suzanne Collins or something like that
B	yeah
A	who wrote this the very
B	yeah
A	like
B	dystopian
A	yeah
B	nightmare
A	like like this is the exact same idea and like erm
B	well
A	and like and so they just told her to go through carry on with it
B	and it's been a big hit hasn't it
A	but
B	well it's it's written for a different audience
A	yeah
B	western western writers have been stealing Japanese culture for years anyway
A	yeah
B	and passing it off as other things like horror and
A	yeah it just seems that like
B	yeah
A	yeah like at least when like like a Hollywood
B	inspired
A	Hollywood goes like
B	inspired by the events of Battle Royale
A	yeah
A	yeah exactly
B	but it's it's a it's a it's an old concept though isn't it like the idea of people unwillingly pitted against each other like erm
A	I haven't seen it but I wanna is that Arnold Schwarzenegger?
B	that's convicts though and the idea it's I think the the prisons are overcrowded so they do this game and it's like whoever wins their freedom
A	yeah
B	and it's kind of the the last man standing
A	have you ever seen Rollerball with Sam Kane?
B	again a similar a similar concept
A	can't believe that isn't
B	it's gonna be in the next Olympics
A	I hope so
B	I used to have a game on the PC called HyberBlade and it was based on rollerball
A	oh really?
B	and it was like it was great cos it was like obstacles in the
A	yeah
B	and then but then your stick was like a sword that if you just got close enough to anyone
A	kill
B	you could maim
A	mm
B	but it was a very good game
A	do you recognise the actress isn't it

B	unwillingly
A	unwillingly
B	she already had a boyfriend doesn't she?
A	she's got another boyfriend?
B	she already had one at the beginning
A	oh
B	why why is Peeta spelt in like a futuristic way?
A	I don't know
B	like in the future names will
A	yeah and sound more like charities
A	an animal charity
B	oh Peeta she just doesn't feel that way
A	like he's gotta get over it a bit really hasn't he? cos like
B	which well if it was you
A	well yeah well but like there's thousands of lives at risk

B	actually?
A	like yeah actually in real life
B	for killing millions of people
A	yeah yeah loads of people like er he like when he was being arrested erm it
B	I presume like Woody Harrelson was growing up having nothing to do with him
A	so are they going back into the
B	what? Woody Harrelson's going in?
A	yeah so regardless of age or
B	health
A	health
B	or

B	and was he?
A	JFK no er and he
A	yeah
B	that's crazy
A	but er they right so Woody didn't really know his dad but erm like I think he since kind of
B	out of prison
A	yeah it's not many like people who can say their dad was an assassin
B	no
A	it's just the er it's just the outfit
B	what is that accent?
A	that's that's me
A	it's me
B	it's me Ringo Starr
A	yeah
B	was that your scouse accent?
A	no that was me doing your your dad cos I thought that I he's like more old timely
