A	right I'll just start that erm
B	okay
A	I believe you don't have coffee
B	erm I do actually I was gonna ask you erm but I've only got hotel coffee
A	what does that mean?
B	well it's coffee I've stolen from hotels
A	right okay so
B	erm
A	if in other words instant no I'll go with tea in that case
B	oh oh okay
A	erm cos that's one of the things that sets my stomach off instant coffee
B	oh right mm
A	I mean to be honest
B	mm
A	any kind of coffee does but I love real coffee so I normally have one in a morning
B	okay
A	so I suppose I'm saying when we go out can we go somewhere where I can get an espresso
B	yeah
A	I I seem to I I had that vague memory erm that you were a tea drinker and you I think the last time I came here
B	oh
A	I stopped off for an espresso en-route
B	oh okay
A	fairly soon
B	you're one of those are you?
A	I'm one of those
B	oh okay
A	well I actually I've actually got an espresso machine I mean I make filter coffee as well but
B	mm
A	I reached a point where
B	oh right
A	so I thought right I'm gonna buy an espresso machine and see if that helps
B	oh yeah a lot of people have them haven't they
A	and actually it doesn't make it any stronger than I make filter coffee
B	oh right
A	but it uses less coffee to do it
B	oh dear
A	so you save having to constantly replenish your coffee supply but
B	but I er
A	a pot for of for four and just drink it
B	oh right
A	in a breakfast mug so that's how I like my coffee
B	oh so you're a serious coffee drinker
A	I am a serious coffee drinker
B	well look if nothing else we can stop off at a Costa on the way home how about that?
A	well yeah or
B	or whatever let's just get the milk in actually
A	right oh yes
B	it's the milkman
A	I was gonna say the excitement of having a milkman
B	so it's so nice to have milk left on your doorstep hurray
A	yes yeah I mean my mum still has her well I'm not sure whether it's a milkman or a milkwoman but erm
B	it it took me ages to erm get him because I didn't know how to contact him
A	yes
B	other than get up at half past five in the morning and intercept him
A	yeah
B	but in in the end they went online so
A	right
B	so it's Milk and More
A	yes I I just think
B	mm
A	that we're I don't think there is one where I live I've never heard or seen anything
B	well there may well be erm I I didn't know but there's this website Milk and More dot co dot UK
A	right
B	that you go on and it'll tell you if they're in your area and then you can just organise it and if you're you're going on holiday you can tell them online and then
A	right
B	just pay by direct debit so
A	oh right I mean
B	I mean it's a bit more expensive but
A	I don't know that it's worth it because I don't think that I drink enough milk
B	ah you're not a Rice Krispies fiend then
A	erm well as I say
A	I do have cereal every morning but I'm not a Rice Krispies fiend no
A	erm
B	so you have cereal do you want cereal?
A	er I've got this with me with is All-Bran
B	oh okay
A	erm because I didn't think you'd necessarily have a bran cereal
B	I've only got
A	erm
B	I've only got Corn Flakes I'm afraid
A	erm
B	or Weetabix
A	oh I'm quite happy to have this
B	okay
A	erm it would mix with it would possibly mix with a few Corn Flakes but it wouldn't mix with Weetabix that would be a very peculiar bowl
B	well do you want Corn Flakes with it?
A	erm I think it's probably that if you've got some bread as well I think I'm probably fine with just just what I've got here
B	oh yeah yeah yeah sure
A	er it's not a huge amount
B	I'll have some toast though
A	you don't need a huge amount of All-Bran but er I always carry it with me when I travel because in fact I think that's probably what I bought that little plastic thing for I take it into hotel dining rooms and mix All-Bran with the hotel's muesli and things like that
B	yeah they're not into are they? when we went to Italy they served cake for breakfast
A	oh
B	he loves cake
B	that's what he has for his er
A	right
B	I don't know what it is
A	I mean that looks fairly gritty but I'm you can't
B	mm
A	you can't tell without reading the the thing on the packet that says I've got quite adept at
B	oh okay oh right
A	erm and it's surprising how quite how muesli is actually quite low
B	in bran?
A	mm
B	oh right
A	it's it's well in fibre
B	yeah it's it's probably one of these things that has got fashionable isn't it
A	if All-Bran is
B	people think it's good but it isn't
A	twenty-four per hundred grams muesli is about six
B	oh right okay
A	on I mean obviously it varies depending on the muesli
B	yeah
A	but it's not something that
B	from a marking kind of er
A	you know yeah
B	thing
A	but a lot of the things like
B	can you plug the toaster in there?
A	erm
B	shove it on there
A	yeah
B	and then I can just er have it close to you then
A	yeah a lot of the things like erm
B	mm erm
A	oh it's alright
B	well it's got a bit old so but next time you'll have your own when you have your bee thing so
A	right er well yes
B	well I've got some jam I I got this is a farmer's market actually where we went last night it was
A	raspberry and lime oh
B	yeah they take up all those roads once a month and anyway we
A	right
B	I've got got some more milk here somewhere
B	well help yourself
A	well actually I've given myself a huge that is a huge portion of All-Bran I'm not sure that I can actually eat all that
B	you can yeah don't want an egg or anything like that?
A	no I'm fine
B	here's a knife for you
A	I see we got through quite a few mugs yesterday
B	yeah
A	erm
B	I always seem to have a pile at the end of the day or the end of the weekend anyway
A	I well I've got you've got some nice big mugs I've got some mugs that go with my plates and bowls which are actually not so big so I've got one big one
B	oh
A	that somebody bought me that I use for tea
B	yeah
A	and one big well a different a sort of breakfast cup shape one that I use for coffee and I don't use the other ones unless I've got visitors
B	I have so many that I've banned myself from buying them now it's crazy
A	so we're leaving that there cos it's more important it picks both of us
B	oh okay and
A	oh
B	but that's the one that came with my plates
A	mm
B	erm
A	oh that's a reasonable
B	yeah
A	size
B	but I've broken all but all but one
A	well you see I haven't broken mine because I don't use them very often
A	oh right
B	I went erm a couple of years ago mm
A	yeah when
[ANNOTATION]	The plates were vintage.	Neutral
B	mm
A	I contacted you and said come I could I come and see you and you were in America that was
B	oh it might have been then
A	mm
B	or was it?
A	it I think
B	no it was two thousand and twelve you were gonna come down wasn't it?
A	yes Easter
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B has visited the America.	Entailment
B	yeah no I went to New York that Easter I think
A	mm
B	yeah yeah my friend
A	oh
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B was in Tokyo that Easter.	Contradiction
B	and she invited us over and I thought oh gosh a long way for a weekend you know
A	mm
B	but then this was like oh well I'm gonna try and make it and I thought oh oh I thought I'll try and make it as well and it was back in 2009 so we did go but it was very difficult because it was right in the middle of exam boards you know
A	mm
B	so I had to bet my boss I had to move
A	mm
B	then Wednesday was revising for my Welsh exam and in work as well you know
A	mm
B	then I did the Welsh exam on Thursday and then I left Saturday morning I think it was flew over
A	I don't really no I'm not
B	oh okay so
A	I'm not big on wedding customs er even in this country let alone in other countries
B	er well I only know through friends really that's that's the only reason I knew what they were talking about but anyway you'd go and they have like a a get together the night before so maybe it's in a restaurant or it could be a barbecue or something you know so we went there and it was absolutely hammering it down in the fog
A	mm
B	when I got back like literally from the airport so erm but it was really good I'm glad I went
A	mm
B	and you know I got back in touch with
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B travelled after finishing his/her exams.	Entailment
A	right
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A is highly into wedding traditions.	Contradiction
B	you know the
B	only had a weekend for the wedding so we thought well we'll go over for a longer stretch and catch up properly so
A	mm
B	mm I did go it's erm where we were
A	so
B	mm
A	do you like New York?
B	mm I do I do and I'm not one for cities but I don't think I'd like to live there
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B want to live in New York for life.	Contradiction
A	mm
B	but there seems to be so much going on there
A	mm
B	I feel like there's loads to explore you know and I think because er although I was a tourist I was staying a local so it's quite nice to hear
A	mm
B	what what they do
A	yes
B	in the city cos I mean
A	oh
B	and it's it's high up you know it's one it's the first storey
A	mm
B	I I guess it's one storey high
A	mm
B	and then this little train would go and of course it had been derelict since the early eighties so erm anyway she got involved with a group that was restoring it and
A	mm
B	and now it's like a little garden er although it's so it's probably it's probably er hardly as wide as this kitchen really or
A	mm
B	about as wide as this kitchen but it goes for miles you know so
A	yeah
B	so they they've done it up with er trees and
A	it's a long finger
B	it's a long finger
A	mm
B	mm
A	well that's a nice yeah
B	so you know stuff like that you well I'm not saying you'd never know about it but you know
A	mm yeah
B	mm and it's finished now so more people know about it
A	no I just
B	mm
A	wasn't American you know saying every time he went to New York as he as as the plane approached the city he could feel his buttocks clenching
B	oh
B	mm
A	more than anything else that he just felt it was a dangerous city erm but
B	yeah well
A	still it was quite amusing
B	yeah I mean I can see why it it would be a bit overwhelming you know it it
A	mm
B	and I kind of assumed Central Park was you know a park you know
A	mm
B	which it is I
A	yeah
B	you know it goes blocks up it's about sixty blocks
A	me
B	you know where
A	right
B	erm so it really is massive
A	mm
B	mm but erm
A	oh well you could go to New Jersey
B	but it was really handy when she was in New York you know
A	yes yes
B	yeah but there there was no fabric shops in New well there there were some but there wasn't like a lot of the fabric for Love Quilts from Walmart
A	oh
B	erm yeah fabric's really expensive here but in Walmart they do it's not only inexpensive fabric they do fabrics you can't really get here like erm dizzy princesses and like kids' fabrics really which you can get
A	oh right
B	but sometimes they're ten pounds a metre here
A	ouch yes
B	yeah and Walmart they do them for I got some it was like seven dollars for two yards so
A	mm yeah
B	that's enough for a quilt
A	right
B	so I bring back as much as I can
A	mm yeah
B	and
A	right
B	when you come back I'm gonna put all this princess fabric in your case
A	but no it would have looked a bit strange
A	yeah why not?
B	yeah erm
A	yeah
B	yeah help yourself
A	right
B	I'll get you a plate yeah er mm
A	just put that to one side
B	was the bed the bed okay? I can put
A	yeah I have I have yes absolutely fine
B	you sleep okay? oh right I've never slept in that bed so
A	the other thing is
B	oh
A	this morning
B	a bit more
A	I turned over and kicked the wall with my leg
B	oh
A	but that was my fault
B	well so long as you didn't headbutt it
A	no no
A	mm does it go in that way?
B	yeah any way
A	right
B	mm
A	now you didn't ask me how I like my toast for all you know I like it either very
B	oh
A	very mild or very un or even burned you don't know
B	oh no that's true there we are you and pop it there
A	it's
A	well well since I don't know how your toaster works I have absolutely no idea
B	oh well I I don't know either to be honest I it seems to change very time I do toast
A	I find that as well
B	mm yeah?
B	mm
A	which of course does need longer erm but it's very unpredictable yeah
B	oh
A	no I
B	oh well you'd better press a button when when you smell it
B	it's more than hot bread yeah I I toasted one of those rolls there
A	mm
A	yes
B	burning after a couple of minutes really
A	well again it's not that easy to find a toaster with slits wide enough to take some wider thing I like muffins and crumpets and my old toaster wouldn't take them
B	take them
A	so I had to do them on the grill which takes forever with an electric grill
B	mm yeah yeah yeah mine takes ages to warm up actually
A	mm
B	yeah
A	well I was brought up with a gas grill which is hugely more efficient
B	mm and instant
A	exactly yes
B	mm
A	erm
B	oh I can hear my fish feeder going
A	yeah so how is that?
A	programmed is it just
B	yeah you can put in the timer and
A	oh
B	and how many times a day
A	right
B	and what time of day
A	so is this something you'd buy from a pet food shop?
B	so for a pet I guess so I I got it off Ebay but
A	oh right
B	yeah but
A	yeah I
B	yeah
B	mm
B	oh you've not been on Ebay?
A	I joined in order to buy when I was flying to buy a a navigation computer because I couldn't really afford to buy a new one erm and I and somebody said well I could have afforded to buy a new one but someone said why don't you go online because it's the sort of thing where people either they're upgrading or they've they've tried flying for a bit for a hobby and then decided they didn't want to continue so it's the kind of thing that does get sold you know
B	oh mm
A	erm I got that that
B	I meant to ask you about that last night I knew there was something I was
A	mm
B	yeah
A	yeah I've stopped now erm I'm really glad I did it it was one of those things I you know I said I would have had aeroplanes on my quilt
B	oh yeah that's right
A	I I've been a Biggles fan since I was ten
B	oh
A	and when I was at school my friends and I you know we all wanted to learn to fly and obviously you just think it's too expensive I can't possibly do it
B	mm
A	and
B	mm
A	and I was driving past one day and there's a there is a a flying club that uses the airport's runway but it's on the other side of the runway from the the actual airport and I was driving past some day there was a sign outside saying trial flights from whatever the price was and I thought I'm gonna ring them up and find out a bit more about it
B	yeah
A	erm because you know this was it's probably about six years ago now I'm not really sure
B	mm
A	erm but you know I was quite sort of settled financially and I did have a bit of money and thought I might be able to afford to do something and
B	mm
A	they had sort of open evenings once a month when you can go along and ask questions so I went along to one
B	mm
A	it was interesting but
B	farrier?
A	as you as you are horse shoes
B	oh
B	oh okay
A	so there's quite a lot of racing stables up in North Yorkshire so he
B	I didn't actually know there were still blacksmiths
A	no I didn't but well because
B	mm
A	racing horses need racing plates on when they're racing so he's
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	but anyway erm and he was great because he understood that I was doing it for fun and I didn't want to get my
B	oh okay
A	and I couldn't fly without
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	so I had a long chat with them and when I actually went for a medical and talked to the doctor and erm we looked at options and and
B	and they said no
A	I decided well I'm not that bothered about getting a licence anyway I didn't really that wasn't really why I was doing it I couldn't imagine ever feeling confident enough to
B	fly on your own
A	fly on my own really
B	oh right
A	no
B	yeah
A	so I couldn't you needed to pass a medical before you could
B	mm
A	and I would have been just terrified but this guy was was great and we'd go up and he'd be sitting in the plane going don't we live in a fantastic county as well looking down to it spread below
B	ah
A	you know and it was just
B	he just let you
A	and
B	get on with it and
A	well
B	mm
A	I learnt quite a lot I mean I learnt navigation is really interesting and I learnt quite a lot about that and and you know we flew different routes each time and he let me work things everything work everything out and
B	mm
A	I never got very good at landing which is a lot more difficult than taking off and some quite a few times he ended up having to take over at that point
B	mm
A	but I did sometimes do it myself
B	oh
A	yes
A	I deduced that
B	turn it off
A	er and
B	it'll go off now
A	and er then he got a proper job with Jet2 I think it was and
B	oh eh okay
A	and
B	oh your low what a budget airline?
A	well I mean something like that yeah but but you know to be a proper pilot
B	let's use the door as a fan
A	yes and the guy who took over was a very good instructor but he never he was very serious and he never quite got the idea that I didn't want to be pushed and every time we went he was pushing me to do something more and I just felt under pressure and I wasn't really enjoying it any more
B	yeah
A	and it was when I was starting to think about selling me house
B	mm
A	and of course I was spending quite a lot of money on this you pay it was you paid
B	oh
A	so it was a it it was a really good
B	and they make for an hour you mean or
A	I think yeah er
B	right or two hours when you're gonna be
A	and then it's got yes exactly
B	right oh gosh mm
A	erm well one drawback of course is
B	mm
A	you can't be flying low you can't you're not allowed to fly in cloud
B	right
A	I mean well I don't mean in a cloud
B	oh so you've got to have a
A	I mean you've got to be under the cloud so there's got to be a reasonable a reasonably high cloud base
B	I see
A	erm and so every time you book a lesson you ring up an hour beforehand to say is the weather okay and even sometimes when you're looking at the sky and you think it is they say well actually
B	there's cloud coming in
A	or it's really really bumpy or
B	mm
A	you
B	mm
A	which I find quite stressful I like timetables
B	yeah
A	and like knowing what's happening yeah
B	oh no it's it's much the same with astronomy you know you plan
A	mm
B	you plan all your kit and you're like right this is what we're doing and then the night comes and sometimes you're even on the field I mean it comes over
A	yeah
B	clouded out you know I used to look at the satellite picture before going out
A	mm
B	I used to have a little email group and I'd send one email and they would bounce it to everyone in the group
A	mm
B	and erm I'd I'd more times than not I'd say erm sorry guys it's just cloudy or it's raining or or whatever you know
A	mm
B	like yeah it's just unpredictable isn't it mm
A	but as I say I'm really glad I did it
B	mm oh yeah oh definitely
A	I did it I did it for about
B	mm I think it's brilliant
A	three three and a half years
B	mm absolutely brilliant cor
A	and you need as I say you learn a lot
B	I dunno if I er I dunno if I'd do it oh maybe I would
A	therefore flying and of course if you're flying from er a proper airport like that rather than a little sort of club
B	mm
A	so you can hear what everybody else is saying it's
B	I think they do it in Swansea that's that's Swansea Airport has closed it well well not closed but it's private again what happened was it was erm basically a private airport then some guy some entrepreneur decided he was gonna make it into a a proper airport
A	mm
B	and it was really good actually but there were some quite small planes so he advertised
A	mm
B	for flight attendants that were five foot three and under
A	oh
B	so it was fun erm and then indeed they started flights they had one to Jersey one to Dublin one to Newcastle and it was going alright you know
A	mm
B	but then I
A	mm
B	it was and people tended to just stay on the motorway and go to Cardiff
A	mm
B	why I don't know cos that's quite far from the motorway as well but I guess they had more flights
A	mm
B	erm so now they just do I guess they do private plane maybe they do lessons there but they do parachuting there's always people er on a Friday you see them floating down
A	well
B	mm
A	if that's something you haven't done do it
B	parachuting?
A	mm well I did it when I I I did one jump when I was at university
B	oh
A	and it was
B	I did a tandem
A	a fantastic experience
B	I did a tandem one
A	I did
B	mm
A	a tandem paraglide off an alp erm but the problem with that was I got sick
B	oh right
A	and I didn't actually throw up but I was feeling so ill they had to bring us down faster erm
B	right
A	because the Alps were sort of swinging backwards and forwards across our vision erm
B	mm
A	and the day before I had driven round about three mountain passes so they'd been doing I'd actually it that's one of the few times I've actually felt sick driving I mean I get sick when somebody else is driving me sometimes but
B	sure
A	actually when I'm driving
B	oh wow
A	not not normally but
B	mm
A	it's er a real shame but er but interesting
B	yeah
A	you just sort of run really so you mustn't slow down
B	what off the edge of a cliff?
A	yeah you're
B	oh god
A	you went up in a ski lift got all this thing all this stuff on and you just run at the edge and you just
B	go for it
A	I mean it's not a cliff in the sense of there's a a ninety degree drop you're running down something that's getting steeper and steeper and steeper so you've you want to stop and he's saying you mustn't because that will bugger everything up
B	goes against every instinct you've got
A	and all this of course
B	run up a
A	cos it was in German cos he didn't speak English
B	oh
B	but you speak German right?
A	oh yeah
B	yeah yeah
A	what am I doing?
B	yeah yeah yeah I was see that's funny I I went skiing in France erm actually oddly enough from the wedding another er a fourth girl
A	mm
B	and anyway so on the way back and what it was the erm experienced skiers had sort of left me and this other girl to our own devices you know and on the way back we
A	mm
B	erm but we were okay you know we were just going slowly and
A	you mean on the slope you got a bit lost?
B	on the slope yeah
A	right on the route
B	but I think we found the route but problem was erm it was really steep and I'd fallen and my ski had stayed up the mountain
B	I couldn't go down it was like that
A	mm
B	and so I was just sitting there and this other girl who was a worse skier than me even
A	mm
B	she didn't even have any poles cos she said she didn't know how to use them or something erm so I was saying look what what what shall I do? and I said ah oh I said to her erm er a couple of the experienced skiers turned up and they said well
A	right
B	I was no leave me I'll I'll die here
B	I mean you know we were fine we we weren't really in trouble but it was getting towards
A	mm
B	half past five so the sun was going down
A	mm yeah
B	and I thought gosh I'm gonna see the New Year in on the mountain
B	anyway she came on this amazing James Bond scooter and anyway the guy managed to get back up the hill and got my ski and we put it in and then this other girl was almost in tears got on the
A	well I don't know if that's the same thing I I've ridden a snowmobile
B	oh yeah that's what it was I think a snowmobile
A	erm
B	yeah
A	on an icecap in Iceland
B	okay go on
A	erm I had a fantastic holiday in
B	yeah
A	erm one of the best holidays I've ever had
B	was that
A	er summer
B	okay
A	erm
B	yeah oh it would be dark in winter
A	June yes June so it was sort of light pretty much the whole time fantastic bird watching you know much there
B	okay
A	you almost didn't need your binoculars
A	and I'd bought a book specifically of Icelandic birds er so I could actually identify things for myself whereas here
B	okay
A	I often need help
B	that's
A	yeah
A	no I'm fine thanks
B	cool
A	erm and I'm quite interested in geology so you know seeing
B	yeah I went I went with
A	mm
B	she went to Iceland in November erm November two thousand and ten or eleven I think
A	right that must have been a very different experience
B	well I I said she'd anyway she rang me up and she said oh
A	mm
B	I don't think it will happen now but I went to my boss and I said look is there any chance?
A	mm
B	and I'd built up quite a few brownie points as well so with other things and he said well as long as you rearrange your classes and you know
A	mm
B	you know sort it out he said I don't see why not you know erm I'd only be taking four days off
A	oh right
B	so er he agreed to it and I was like hey great so so we went
A	so whereabouts did you go?
B	er well we just stayed in Reykjavik
A	right
B	and did the golden circle and the touristy stuff
A	right
B	you know but so erm so yeah it was pretty dark it was dark till
A	yeah
B	ten in the morning like so I take it you went further round the island did you?
A	I drove all the way round yes
B	mm I would love to do that
A	cos there's basically one road that goes all the way round and if you drive through the middle
B	yeah yeah
A	you you're fording rivers and things and I didn't think that was a very good idea on my own
B	I'd love to do that
A	erm so my parents had done that and they had actually planned to drive down the middle they'd booked they'd booked a four wheel drive from Akureyri and
B	oh yeah
A	it's but it's
B	yeah
A	I mean Reykjavik is tiny isn't it I mean for a capital city
B	yeah I know
A	but
B	well I didn't even know I think
A	Akureyri is even smaller
B	I don't even know if they had another university but she was they had a school up there and
A	well I mean it's so
B	yeah
A	I think they probably it probably small because the population is small isn't it
B	well she she came back
A	but
B	she came back because the economy you know
A	yeah
B	it it all went to hell
A	but it's so
B	yeah
A	the population is so scattered I can see why they would have
B	yeah
A	one in each place but
B	oh it must be dark up there in winter though
A	well I
B	it's dark enough in Reykjavik
A	I was in
B	oh
A	Stockholm for new year once erm cos when I was in China one of my best friends was Swedish and and
B	oh okay
A	and and yeah we particularly because she
B	mm
A	so she'd come home at about half eleven midnight and we'd sit up chatting till three in the morning so we were getting up really late and we didn't see the sun at all
A	and we missed of them
B	yeah
A	but er
B	no I can imagine that you know getting up
A	no er anyway
B	how you do
A	I I went somewhere on the south coast the there's a a
B	mm
A	there was one particular one where you know you could go up to a hotel and and rent these snowmobiles and there was a somebody was running a sort of thing
B	oh cool
A	where he met you in a car park at the bottom of the hill and everybody piled into his
A	erm and drove so cos I wouldn't have wanted it was a sort of road that you wouldn't have wanted to drive up
B	mm mm
A	er and you couldn't have done it in a normal car I don't think and I I just rented a normal car
B	yeah
A	erm and
B	mm mm
A	they were meant for two people and everybody else of course was in pairs except one Italian woman erm so
B	oh okay
A	I we said right okay we'll go on together but she had I don't know why she'd expected there to be a driver
B	okay
A	so she didn't want everybody else went on in pairs and and one of them drove out to you know and and then when we sort of got off and
B	oh right
A	god it does your arms in you've really got to hold on tightly to to make it work
B	oh okay
A	and maybe I was holding on more than I needed to cos I was a bit nervous
B	yeah
A	and the next day my forearms
B	ah
A	were really painful
B	yeah yeah I drove a boat back from Llanedi once when I was diving in the
A	mm
B	yeah the next it was tight these you know
A	yes
B	oh there
A	yes I can imagine
B	yeah ah right
A	yeah
B	yeah I mean oh is that the postman? I think it was erm
A	well that also
B	putting a fire bomb through
A	or a fire bomb through
A	those police those policemen did go though yesterday didn't they I mean
B	yeah
A	I presumed they didn't actually
B	yeah
A	try and burn the school down or anything
B	oh
A	mm
B	and sometimes it's stuff that's you know not anything
A	mm
B	but once he saw erm what had happened? my parents were away and I think there was a mattress was being dumped outside
A	mm
B	and I think the side door had blown open and he was a bit worried that someone had come in and
A	mm
B	and left stuff all over you know and he
A	mm
B	he rang the police then and they came round you know
A	yeah
B	so he's he's you know and it wasn't anything and he was a bit embarrassed but I said
A	no it's good yeah
B	you know it's it it could have been something
A	I would dial
B	I would but erm
A	I don't know how many people would I mean
B	mm
A	whenever a burglar alarm went off at my other house
B	yeah
A	I would go out and look to see whose it was and
B	mm
A	whether they actually did anything I don't know but
B	mm
A	I did report it
B	well he lives in number three here so he can see straight into the school
A	mm
B	and I think cos they've been leafleting us saying can you look out
A	yes yeah
B	he's he's called them round but yeah he's very good yeah
A	oh
B	he's a nice bloke
A	I had a
B	oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	whose surname I actually don't
B	just
A	er
B	oh
A	something ridiculous like that
B	oh
A	fantastic er and she's got a nephew and niece who don't live and
B	okay
A	and a sister who don't live that far away you know but even so you know she must get lonely she does a lot of cleaning you know she cleans this room on a Monday kind of thing and this room on a Tuesday
B	mm I can imagine that
A	yeah
A	no not me
B	don't look at anything
A	I work I don't have time to do all like that
B	yeah
A	but actually it's not because I work it's because I can't be bothered
B	well there's more interesting things to do isn't there?
A	well
B	yeah
A	I just I mean I don't want to live in a really dirty house
B	mm
A	fine I do but
B	yeah
A	and just occasionally I think right okay I'd better do a proper clean here
B	yeah I mean I I have a very similar approach like I mean when people come to stay I mean not that I've been cleaning the house madly before you came but you know I thought oh you know
A	it motivates you to do a bit more doesn't it?
B	it does it does and
A	see
B	all these dead woodlice comes
A	when I was a a kid that was my dad's job he would vac the the house every Saturday morning while my mother was doing other things erm and so
B	yeah
A	he did do that he was you know
B	well when
A	well I
B	but I still don't want him cleaning my woodlice you know
A	I now I now do try and bleach my sink since
B	oh I get that
A	stained you know and it doesn't bother me but I think if a man's commenting on how unclean your kitchen is you really ought to be doing something about it
B	you're in trouble
A	yes
A	well I mean the my brother had made those sort of remarks but my brother is not a normal human being
B	ah yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	you know erm I I took that with a pinch of salt but when somebody else says it you
B	what's this letter? oh oh it's my tokens
A	tokens?
B	oh that's good yeah erm
A	no
B	Tesco points?
A	no I don't do points with any of these supermarkets
B	oh okay well I I've got the Tesco points and basically you go on and you you can spend the tokens in the supermarket if you want to and just have money off off your shop or you can go on and double them online and you get things like half price rail tickets and
A	oh right
B	so it's worth having anyway so I got these they're they were only five pound fifty erm and they're
A	mm
B	so they but they posted out cos I was gonna go on Wednesday cos they do this after dark thing erm but I
A	yeah
B	yeah well not just turning up he said we could you know
A	yeah yeah
B	and er go to
A	oh right
B	it's it's not like Alton Towers or anything it's
A	oh right I was gonna say what is
B	they have some rides you know but it's oh it's just a nice day out really
A	I was looking
B	yeah
A	the bumf that I've erm got for where I'm going erm the route planner says two hours five minutes from here to there
B	oh okay
A	erm
B	to
A	well it's just it's just beyond
B	okay
A	erm
B	see
A	so
B	mm
A	what I mean were you thinking of going this morning in your car and coming back here? or cos er if we're going
B	yeah
A	if we're
B	mm well yeah we can do
A	if we go in any one car we're gonna have to come back here aren't we?
B	yeah cos otherwise we'd need to take two cars yeah
A	we can't otherwise I would er yeah yes
B	yeah we'll go in my car cos if you're driving later so
A	erm
B	go in my car for a
A	well I mean whichever
B	oh
A	I was just thinking either we go in two cars and I then go on from there or which is a bit ridiculous erm or we go in one car and then we will we would be coming back here so I I reckon I I could do with leaving here about half two but three would be okay
B	okay
A	what I've said to them
B	oh that should be fine
A	erm
B	I mean we can head off you know
A	yeah
B	soonish and
A	erm
B	okay and we can have some lunch down there if you want er
A	yeah
B	and come back come back here after
A	I could do
B	oh
A	erm juice and some I couldn't
B	yeah I
A	oh it's alright it's fine
B	do you want some juice?
A	no I'm fine with the tea
B	oh
A	yeah
B	oh I didn't think
A	erm
B	I bought some specially
A	well
B	I've got orange and apple
A	erm
B	never mind well if you want some it's in there
A	but things like juice and butter obviously I didn't pack in the car yesterday so I do need to go to a supermarket
B	yeah
A	easier to go into somewhere small
B	remember the erm
A	and if you don't want a lot of things
B	the one we went to last time to get your Actimel stuff?
A	we did didn't we?
B	erm yeah we walked down there's that one
A	right
B	we could go in there yeah it's a Tesco Express but it's got loads of
A	erm that yeah that's that's the sort of thing I was thinking
B	okay
A	erm I don't as I say I don't need a lot but
B	so if we call there
A	otherwise I've got to look somewhere in
B	oh right
A	and I don't know what there is
B	so if we call there on the way back maybe
A	mm that would make sense
B	for your juices it's not getting warm in the car sort of thing
A	yes
B	okay yeah cool
A	although it doesn't look as if it's going to be a terribly hot day
B	no
A	er well
A	it's definitely brighter than it was yesterday
B	yeah yeah
A	but er
B	well at least it's stopped raining
A	I was thinking I'll probably still I've got my rain jacket in the car I was thinking I probably ought to wear that though if it it was forecasting
B	yeah
A	rain at some point erm and in any case I I think I'm probably gonna get my hiking books out of the car
B	for the
A	yeah
B	erm I'd probably just wear my trainers but not sure
A	I normally do put boots on if I go anywhere like that
B	I'm not sure where there's grass or
A	cos you never quite know and it was since it was quite wet yesterday it could be
B	yeah maybe I should stick mine in the car yeah
B	or not not sure if there's sort of walking through you know muddy bits or anything actually we went erm meant to tell you last night erm have you heard of geocaching?
A	oh
B	and you do it with GPS
A	right
B	okay so
A	mm
B	and then if you go for a walk or something erm it's almost like something to do on your walk you know
B	but the thing is even though you've got the coordinates some people are really really good at hiding them so you're almost on top of them and can't see them you know and you're looking in holes in trees and
A	mm
B	which sounds a bit almost a bit sad really but it's quite fun you know erm so I've been doing that a little bit and we'd done well it was the other day
A	mm
B	you forget don't you and you're sinking in
A	well
B	and my friend
A	I tend to wear my hiking boots if I'm going
B	mm
A	anywhere where I might want to wear them you know what I mean?
B	mm
A	because it's too late when you've got halfway down the path and you realise that actually there's quite a few puddles for instance
B	yeah sure
A	erm
B	yeah yeah if you want a erm
A	and if you're doing the driving I can just put them on to go
B	yeah
A	I don't need to take them to change into
B	mm
A	they're quite comfortable
B	I got my friend
A	mm
B	cos she's always out with the dog and I think I texted her and I said erm oh I'm out looking for geocache and she said oh what's that so I told her and now she's found over three hundred and
A	oh you see
A	when you said geocache I was spelling it C A S H but you're spelling it C H E
B	C er
A	yeah?
B	yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah yeah and it's fun and some people do erm like puzzle ones I found one and it was up a tree
A	mm
B	I was I was looking for ages thinking I'm sure these are the coordinates
A	mm
B	where is it? you know and then eventually I looked up and I could see this bag almost at at the top of the tree and thought well I'll never get up there but then when I looked there was a rope and they'd actually formed like a pulley system
B	so I was quite remote in the wood you know
B	and this pulley system and they'd sort of tied it round erm what do you call it? erm when it comes out of a tree like little sticky bit that comes out of a tree?
A	branch?
B	no not not branch you know like a broken off branch but anyway whatever whatever that
A	stump
B	yeah yeah
A	that's sort of a branch
B	yeah but yeah yeah and you tied it round there so it was you just untied it and then you lowered it down
B	and then you opened it and signed the log and put it back up again
B	it's really cool yeah
A	mm
B	I I know it sounds a bit a bit weird but it is actually a lot of fun and if you look on erm on there is you can have an app for your phone if you've if you've got a smartphone
A	mm
B	or you can you can buy a little GPS so
A	well I I mean it's not something that
B	yeah
A	I would want to do
B	yeah
A	but it's just
B	yeah
A	it's really interesting the things that people are finding to do with the
B	absolutely
A	modern technology it's just
B	absolutely yeah
A	amazing
B	cos my my quilting thing couldn't exist without
A	yeah
B	I mean it it could on a limited scale but
A	no
B	yeah yeah I think people underestimate how much the internet is changing society really cos you interact with people overseas so
A	yes
B	so easily you know
A	yeah but just
B	erm
A	yes just
B	yeah
A	it's permeating so many areas of life and people being so creative
B	yeah yeah
A	in how they're using it it's
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	but I've got friends who I
A	mm
B	there was no way that we'd ever have met
A	yes
B	and to find people with the same interests is very hard in the local area so
A	mm yeah
B	it's brilliant
A	you know and you look back to
B	yeah
A	how
B	mm
A	if you look back to the way people lived two or three hundred years ago staying in their own little village and basically knowing the same few hundred people at most
B	yeah
A	it's impossible to imagine what that must have been like
B	yeah it's bad isn't where people could live and never leave their village
A	yeah
B	and it was quite possible
A	yeah
B	yeah yeah
A	just
B	it's always when I watch Pride and Prejudice or something you know I I had the BBC one on it was on one of these satellite channels you know
A	yes yes
B	well Freeview channels yeah you look at it and think god they say oh fifty miles a fair long way
A	yes but I mean at least they had
B	er yeah yeah sure yeah yeah
A	get out to visit people and so on erm
B	mm
A	and money for lighting and so and things like that you know I mean if you were poor you'd be
B	yeah
A	basically living by the sun wouldn't you?
B	well yeah I mean my mother you know sometimes mentions you know when they used to read by candlelight in the night and I that was
A	well can remember doing that in
B	not that long ago you do?
A	was it nineteen seventy-one or when we had the
B	oh when the power was out yeah
A	yes
B	no this was before they had
A	actually my dad
B	yeah yeah
A	rigged up a erm a headlight on a battery car headlight
B	oh
A	in the living room so that we
A	and you couldn't do anything else well you couldn't watch television obviously anyway
B	yeah
A	so he rigged this up so we could
B	ah
A	a bit more comfortably than cos candlelight is not good for your eyes
B	no I know no I
A	right
B	er or fifties even
A	well I remember reading a biography of Enid Blyton and the cottage where she was living had a well for the water
B	oh right
A	well I mean not one of
B	yeah
A	one of the cottage obviously she didn't only live in one house all her life but
B	mm
A	one of the places where she lived
B	mm
A	er and being quite surprised and then thinking well actually I don't really know enough
B	oh
A	about things like that
B	yeah I mean it's so
A	cos both my parents grew up to towns
B	it it's so amazing I mean when I went to the Olympics I was camping for three weeks you know
A	mm
B	and it's not that I haven't camped before but I think cos it was a longer period
A	mm
B	and I was going for water and you know
A	mm
B	bring it back and then and we had to use quite a lot because we had to wash our uniform as well
A	right
B	so I had like a big bucket and then erm a plunger
A	mm
B	I I looked this up on Youtube erm what you do is get a plunger and then drill holes through the plunger
A	right
B	so I got the boys in work to do that and and then you do it and it creates enough bubbles and it it cleans quite well in er
A	right
B	in your bucket so we're doing that obviously loads of water so when I came home to have water on tap
A	mm
B	oh cold water on tap was brilliant but to have hot water on tap
A	yes
B	you know even now sometimes oh hot water on tap it's amazing you know
A	well the
B	but
A	first
B	you know mm
A	I lived for two years in Japan with no hot water on tap
B	yeah yeah
A	erm I was
B	yeah
A	filling the bath with cold water and heating up well you know turning like gas on and hit would heat up did you
B	oh no
A	know anybody who had one of those?
B	oh that sounds a bit dangerous
A	but when I first went out there that was quite
B	mm
A	typical the way of Japanese use technology you know the they'll do things that sort of replicate the way they used to do things without technology if you see what I mean so instead of having bloody central heating with all like er taps
A	you know
B	yeah
A	erm this was
B	it was weird isn't it? yeah
A	they used to have a a bath with a wood fire underneath and I actually had a student when I first went out there who lived in the countryside and they still did that so they'd go out and have to go out and out of outside the house you know so the access is outside
B	oh and light a fire underneath?
A	yes
B	oh right
A	and light the fire and it would heat the water up
B	oh okay
A	erm and so a lot of the of people when I first went out a lot of of I and and quite a few of my colleagues have this sort of bath where you filled it with cold water and you you had a sort of plastic cover that you put over it
B	oh yeah
A	erm and
B	yeah to keep the heat in
A	to keep the heat in
B	mm
A	and you erm
B	yeah
A	hot and go and have a hot bath first thing just to get moving in a morning cos it was so cold
B	yeah it was really cold
A	but
B	I mean I thought it was amazing Japan like you know obviously they had really high technology
A	yes
B	almost ahead of what we had here
A	yeah
B	erm in terms of TVs and electronics and what have you and then but really sort of low technology like drop toilets and and it all seemed cheek by jowl and I I know there's reasons cos of earthquakes and stuff that
A	well it's they it's that it's it's also
B	they don't want to have piping but
A	that they they've
B	mm
A	it's not that's not just about earthquakes though it's about I mean
B	mm
A	beyond a certain distance you were on bottled gas and gravity toilets
B	yeah
A	you know it was just they just hadn't extended the infrastructure far enough
B	yeah
A	so it was only in the big cities
B	mm
A	and I think that was it
B	so it was a I felt it was a big mix of
A	yeah
B	old and new together
A	yeah I mean
B	yeah
A	I can remember that our first year erm some Japanese friends I knew got a new toilet and they took us to show us this new toilet which had got a heated seat and erm
B	oh like in the
A	you know two different squirts to wash yourself
B	squirting yes
A	and a and er and er er hot air to dry afterwards and everything and then you know I got this house which just had a hole in the floor
B	yeah
A	and this funny wagon
A	comes round every two months and
B	yeah
A	you're supposed to pour buckets of water down while they're clearing it out to up the
A	as you did it
B	yes
A	it's just really
B	yes
A	and it
B	ah
A	certainly smelt it in summer
B	oh yeah
A	whatever you did erm
B	I remember
A	mm
B	and all their toilets were linked and as he was foreign he was deemed that he he was not good enough to help with the extractions sort of thing
B	so the other people had to come and help him you know to to throw buckets of water down and what have you but he was not able to do that
A	right yes
B	you know that's not you know a foreigner no no
A	yes
B	yeah er I had something like that in Miyachi someone came to see me and they they were talking about sorting rubbish you know and they said well er you're you're a foreigner so you pay us thousand yen and and we'll sort it for you I was like that seems like a good deal for a year you know
A	yes
B	which we could cope with
A	yeah
B	well I could some of the others
A	right
B	but in Miyoshi they had they had about eight different bags
A	oh right
B	they had one massive bag for batteries it's like well I've only got two double As
A	mm
B	at the bottom of those bags
A	well I suppose it
B	some types
A	because they don't have a the they must have been including things that here you'd take to a tip yourself
B	yeah
A	I mean batteries you cos as you say you don't have that many to throw away so you don't
B	yeah they don't have
A	oh really?
B	yeah when I was there was erm so the king in the king you know I told you about the king?
A	mm
B	through er the guy in the Chinese takeaway
A	yeah
B	the reason we met him was on Begomy night
A	right
B	where
A	that you were prowling round looking for bargains
B	well we didn't have anything our flat was empty you know we'd just arrived and he was prowling round and anyway we met him and er he said oh come on I'll show you all the best shots you know and he'd
A	right
B	he'd been to
A	right
B	and he knew a bit of English so he went round and he he got me a bike and all sorts you know and that's how we met him but so when I went back to see him he'd had his stroke but anyway and
A	yeah
B	I managed to talk to talk to his wife and arrange a time and what have you and I went back and he said oh there isn't Begomy any more he said they've
A	oh
B	they've stopped it
A	so what will they do if they've got big
B	I don't know I guess they have to take it to the tip like we do I'm not sure I mean I I didn't have a big conversation cos you know
A	but I mean actually big stuff
B	mm
A	you don't have to here you can get it collected by the council if you organise it
B	yeah well maybe it's the same there
A	I mean it depends what you mean by big obviously things that you can that you can carry and fit in your car you can take to the tip
B	yeah
A	but if it's something that you
B	maybe that's what they do and rather than have one night but it seems less efficient somehow but
A	yeah I dunno
B	maybe it's cheaper for
A	I mean when I when I was in Germany which is twenty years ago
B	mm
A	you had to sort
B	oh okay
A	and anything that was not recyclable
B	land landfill like yeah
A	erm
B	mm
A	and everything else you were supposed to take to the tip yourself so they weren't coming round and collecting it you had to take it but there was one in the little town where I was living you know and and a little man there watched very carefully to make sure that you were putting things in the right place because all the plastics you had to separate
B	oh wow
A	on the plastic and you had to put them in separate
B	oh so you mean a different
A	yes
B	oh that's really good
A	erm
B	mm
A	and I separated them all at home and had them all and took them in different bags so on one occasion I was just emptying a bag into one of the things and he came up and was very sort of
B	ah
A	and and he's sort of searching through to check that I'd actually
A	picked them picked them
B	yes
A	you know I've already sorted them I've do understand
B	the rubbish police
A	I'm not an idiot
B	oh
A	cardboard and newspapers were in two separate things and again you know he was standing there watching to make nobody put a cereal packet in the in with the newspapers
B	yeah
A	erm
B	I mean erm I must say I dunno much I'm impressed with with
A	right
B	cos first of all there's no wheelie bins they
A	right
B	yeah so what we have is we have like a black bag for
A	mm
B	what's the word you used in German?
A	yes
B	yeah yeah for landfill stuff
A	yeah
B	and then we have pink for plastic
A	mm
B	green for paper and card erm what else do we have? we have erm I dunno if you're doing these the er compostable waste
A	er no I've got a compost bin
B	right well
A	in my garden
B	they tried it for a while but people didn't really use it cos then they were getting like maggots in there and things but
A	mm yes well you do mm
B	yeah but they started them with these bags
A	oh
B	and they they decompose you know they don't decompose here they
A	no yeah yeah
B	decompose later and that's really good and we put that out and there's another bin outside you can put it into
A	mm
B	cos I used to have a wormery before it started
A	mm
B	I have out at the back and these worms in it and it would
A	mm
B	eat eat eggshells and thing erm so they do that that's really good
A	yeah
B	and then there's garden waste as well they give us rather nice white bags I bought some extra ones to keep fabric in but they're meant to be for garden waste you know and then it's fortnightly so it's black and pink one week
A	yeah
B	and green the next but the food waste is weekly
A	mm
B	so that's really good so you
A	yes
B	you know even if you miss it it's not hanging round for
A	yeah
B	for a month actually I was gonna put the rubbish out actually have they been?
A	no we've we've got wheelie bins
B	oh
A	wheelie bins for everything except garden waste and we had green bags which are good because you can carry them round the garden
B	yeah
A	erm and they've just introduced wheelie bins for that as well so
B	yeah
A	I mean obviously I carry my bags round the garden and then take them to the bin and empty them into the big because I can't move the bin all round the garden but
B	I'm so glad we don't have wheelie bins
A	I can understand that it's it's easier for the er people but at my other house I was up fourteen steps
B	oh
A	and so I never got a wheelie bin I I said look I don't I opted out which you could do but basically everyone in the street should have opted out they shouldn't ever have delivered them to my street somebody should have looked at the street and said
B	no way
A	all these people are going to have to keep their wheelie bins in the street and there was a thing on the leaflet saying don't keep it in the street but of course everybody did so the whole street had got a line of wheelie bins all the time
B	yeah
A	except for mine because I'd actually read the leaflet
B	people are going nuts in Bath because they say it's so unslightly
A	yeah
B	because people have to keep them on the on the road
A	yeah
B	and sometimes it's three or four you know
A	yes
B	yeah
A	yeah well I've got
B	mm
A	three and a half cos I share one with my next door neighbour
B	oh okay right
A	erm they the the glass metal and plastic
B	okay
A	erm some people have an inset in the paper bin that
B	ah so they can put their yeah
A	and and we have a whole bin
B	between you
A	between us
B	mm
A	erm
B	yeah
A	so to be honest I hardly ever do anything with that because he gets up early and goes to work so he he always puts it out
B	sorted yes
B	yeah no I'm really glad they haven't cos people in flats I just don't know what they'd do you know
A	yes
B	so
A	yeah
B	yeah so anyway we stick it out and yeah it seems a pretty good system so
A	mm
B	mm but I mean it's taken years cos I've been recycling for donkey's years now
A	oh yes
B	before I remember taking plastic you know when I used to go to the motorway I I wouldn't make a special trip but if I was going to the motorway there was a plastic bin
A	right cos yes a lot of places didn't have plastic for a long time
B	well
A	you see we've now
B	yeah
A	got a thing erm
B	ah okay
A	so obviously I don't know whether their recycling facilities was better than other people and but other people must have been using it and so they they everybody who paid council tax was sent was a form and you had to take it the next time you went to the tip
B	oh right
A	and they have you a a little sticker to keep I your car
B	oh okay
A	so and you have they do check it you have to show it
B	ah
A	right
B	so we used to do that but but to be honest since I've had the milkman I've had so much less plastic
A	mm
B	cos I've just mainly bottles
A	well you see I've got an Actimel thing every day
B	yeah
A	erm and the milk
B	mm
A	that's mostly it for plastic I mean you and you you get or washing up liquid bottles and things like that as well
B	yeah sure yeah mm
A	but it's not now I've noticed that my neighbours are putting I don't know whether to say anything or not cos it sounds like you're being the rubbish police but they're putting plastic cartons in and if you look at the thing that we were sent it says
B	no cartons
A	bottles not cartons
B	now see it doesn't say for us cos it used to say no bottles but now it doesn't say it people put everything in but I don't think the council mind cos they're they're trying to cut down on
A	well I mean they're obviously having to sort if you're putting plastic and glass and metal all in one bin somebody's got to sort it anyway
B	mm
A	so it's
B	well if
A	I I kind of think it's up to the council to
B	be clearer
A	decide whether they're
B	mm
A	going to put a note through their door and say oi
B	yeah
A	erm
B	yeah I mean with the food food waste they used to say er no oh actually it does say on there no meat no fish no plastics
A	well
B	which doesn't compost of course
A	I inherited a compost bin
B	mm
A	which I have been using but
B	mm
A	my dad had I mean obviously you can just have a heap of stuff but my dad actually did one with a
B	mm
A	so I've got lots of bricks
B	oh okay
A	and I thought that's actually a fairly straightforward thing to do
[ANNOTATION]	The bricks belong to speaker B.	Contradiction
B	and make yourself one
A	but I need this is
B	right
A	erm because I've got plenty of places to put compost
B	so they don't do erm compost waste in
A	no I mean I could take
B	no they they don't do curb site for it?
A	no no no
B	oh right oh
A	I mean some of it is garden waste
B	yeah yeah sure
A	that could go in the garden waste ting but obviously the food stuff from the from a kitchen no
B	oh right
[ANNOTATION]	Kitchens waste tones of food.	Neutral
A	there's nowhere to put that
B	I think we've been doing it about four years er
A	well I mean the fact is I can use it myself
B	mm
A	so I don't need to put er
B	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A doesn't throw away a lot of food.	Neutral
A	even if they did collect I would probably still be doing it myself
B	mm
A	because I've got enough of a garden that I need compost
B	yeah oh yeah sure you have to yeah for it's actual purposes
A	yes
[ANNOTATION]	Food is composted by the community.	Neutral
B	yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah well yeah but I've not got that I just have a jungle
A	oh right yes
B	oh and one day I'll do it but er I I just don't really know what to do with it because the run off of water on the school is incredible and it's
A	mm
B	it's almost washed away the bottom of the garden so it's all that funny angle now
A	I was looking out and seeing and I see what you mean
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	There is no water at school.	Contradiction
A	about that decking next door
B	oh yeah did you see it? yeah
A	I mean it's not just that as you say that would actually have made a sensible addition to your garden and they would still have quite a bit garden
B	yeah
A	but if they actually sit on that decking and sort of laughing and chatting
B	yeah
A	it's right over your fence
B	yeah but I don't go out there so I don't care
A	right
B	but erm yeah it it is close but
A	it's just a funny place for them to have put it but they've got they even have a
B	but again say there I er you know and as far as I know I've seen them there maybe once this summer maybe I haven't been looking but I can't remember seeing them sitting on it
A	well I mean there have been plenty of occasions this summer
B	it's too far from the house
A	you could have well that's what I meant it's a funny place for them to put it cos you don't just walk out and oh I forgot my coffee cup I'm going back into the house for it when it's that far away do you?
B	yeah yeah I just
A	yeah
B	but maybe it depends what happens with the house really cos I don't know yet if if I am going to extend you know and if I do
A	well you need to think about that and look into
B	yeah
A	costings and all sorts of things there don't you so you've got a a picture and then talk to them maybe and see cos I mean if they just gave you a flat out no that's an answer but
B	yeah
A	there's no point in asking them if if you don't really want it
B	see
A	mm
B	obviously I haven't got my own garden done so I was thinking well
A	yeah
B	why do I want an extra bit of garden? but of course things have changed now so
A	yes I mean I don't
B	yeah
A	I don't particularly enjoy gardening I enjoy having a garden which means you've got to do some gardening and I sort of keep up with the the minimum amount of maintenance erm
B	oh I don't now
A	I mean a visited a friend who rents okay but she was saying that they've got this fairly small square of lawn behind the house which okay will be a lot easier to mow than mine which is sort of uneven and on a slope and and needs a long cable cos it goes quite a long way away from any electricity supply but
A	she was saying that oh it doesn't quite do seven days I'm having to do it every six days and I'm thinking oh mine's lucky if it gets done
B	yeah
A	three weeks
B	well what I tell myself is that my garden is great for hedgehogs and
A	well a lawn a lawn
B	the bees and their population is in decline
A	yes
B	it's because there aren't gardens like mine any more
A	right okay
B	and therefore it is a service to nature that's what I say
A	well the trouble is I've got quite a few bits around the edge of my garden that would be good for hedgehogs as well
B	oh
A	but the lawn's good for blackbirds and other thrushes
A	yeah right I see
B	oh that sounded a bit Welsh didn't it? I would do it lovely but
A	yes
A	oh yes it's but my mum said has she got a Welsh accent? and I
B	have I?
A	and I said a little bit of a lilt
B	it's probably stronger
A	well I
B	when I speak to my mum
A	haven't
B	mm
A	yeah well I'm mine I get more Yorkshire
B	yeah
A	if I'm talking to someone from Yorkshire
B	yeah
A	but I hadn't really noticed it when you were in Hiroshima at all
B	no
A	it was only when I visited you here that I
B	yeah
A	oh yes she does sound a bit Welsh
B	I think I tend to adapt to the people around me
A	mm
B	er some people don't they stick
B	yeah
A	in Japan yes
B	yeah yeah
A	mm
B	I catch myself using American words sometime and I thought what am I doing? you know but I maybe it's years of
A	well that's you've
B	listening to foreign languages and
A	yes I was going to say
B	you know and
A	that's also to do with English teaching and you're in Japan you learnt that you had to use the American vocabulary cos they didn't they hadn't learnt the British vocabulary I was quite amused the other day when I was talking to
B	ah
A	so obviously the
B	you do in
A	casualty as you call it
B	I dunno what I call it now er yeah I call it A and E I think
A	well
B	but the TV show of course is still
A	is still called Casualty yes
B	yeah
A	so people would still understand that here
B	casualty
A	but obviously he worked for a for British firms for quite a
B	yeah it's become an old word hasn't it? it
A	well and
B	I do say A and E
A	cos I remember when he when he
B	mm
A	I think it must have been with with
A	yes
A	cos when I first went out there they did in the house was really there were it was a really fairly equal number of Americans and Australians and Brits and one Canadian
B	right yeah yeah
A	it got more British
B	yeah when I was there it was fairly British but we did have
A	but when he's he said when he came back
B	oh yeah
A	somebody at some point made one of those dismissive oh well you're American sort of remarks and he was quite pissed off
B	yeah
A	and I thought and we said yeah that would not have happened my first year there
B	yeah
A	because it just wasn't like that it you know it was what can I say?
B	yeah
A	much more equal
B	yes well er
A	yes
B	yeah yeah
A	right yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	I saw them in Perth actually cos I hadn't heard from them like since I left Japan
A	mm
B	I was like they don't like me any more
A	yeah
B	cos I literally never heard from them
A	well some people are good at communicating
B	I
A	and some people you don't exactly
B	no
A	keep
B	no I know I don't
A	the odd Christmas yes
A	you're very good at Christmas card
B	yeah
A	but not in between time
B	yeah sure but I I had written them Christmas cards at least
A	mm
B	I I never heard anything so
A	right
B	er erm yeah I I should try and be better I just seem so busy all the time
A	well I yes I mean fair enough see I don't work full time and you do
B	mm
A	but I just thought cos you were a techy that you'd probably email a lot
B	yeah I I
A	to people
B	I do but I think since
A	yeah
B	that takes my emailing energy
A	yes
B	and I don't tend to
A	yeah
B	I mean I email
A	cos I
B	I know
A	I kind of use emails as a substitute for letters I used to write letters
B	yeah
A	erm you know and I've still got letters that my my school friends and I used to write letters in the school holidays to each other
B	now see again perhaps it's because of Facebook because I'm
A	mm
B	see a lot of people on Facebook
A	yes yes
B	so I don't tend to email them now erm or I might send them a message a private message via Facebook maybe maybe I'm not emailing any more I dunno
A	mm well I mean things
B	think about it really
A	you things move on don't they
B	yeah
A	You know cos I have kind of moved on to email and and both oddly both the couples that I'm friends with in Germany write letters I mean
B	yeah
A	and rather like you and
B	oh
A	and
B	okay
A	er they've been married for I don't know I mean quite a few years not but they weren't married when I when first met them I taught them each of them separately on different courses at the
B	oh
A	the British Council and then they invited me out for a drink which you didn't didn't really I didn't really I was quite lonely in Germany because in Japan we did we had enough colleagues that we'd go out after work and in Germany most of the people I was working with were women whose husbands were German and they were going off home to their husbands and children after work and that sort of thing so
B	yeah
A	you didn't socialise with colleagues much and the students it was a different sort of atmosphere somehow
B	mm
A	and these people asked me for a drink and we ended up sort of keeping in touch after I'd left Germany and I would go back and they had not just a spare room they had a spare flat
B	oh like you do
A	they their flat was on the fifth floor
B	yeah
A	erm a really nice location in the centre of Munich if you're going to live in a city it was a great place to live I mean I'm not like you I'm not into cities but
B	mm
A	and they so often had people visiting cos his family comes from Schleswig-Holstein way up in the north and his brother actually worked in the Czech Republic so
B	okay
A	so they started renting the flat on the second floor which was a bit smaller
B	oh
A	but in the same building just for their residents
B	oh wow
A	so when I went
B	sociable
A	I could stay there for several days there and I'd go up and have meals with them
B	yeah
A	and and we'd go out and do things but when they were working it was obviously better for them to have a guest who wasn't there all the time
B	yeah yeah oh that's a really good idea
A	erm and
B	so you're totally self-contained
A	yes
B	just do your own thing
A	yeah
B	oh right mm well that's very generous of them to er
A	yes
A	well I mean I think it was for their families rather than for me
B	yeah yeah yeah well sure but yeah well yeah well
B	maybe not
A	and they've now moved to to Nuremburg and and they're renting a house rather than a
B	yeah
A	a flat and it's a so it's a a different sort of set-up but
B	they tend to rent do they?
A	but
B	generally?
A	that's what Germans do
B	yeah
A	I mean they're both
B	mm
A	she's
B	oh right
A	very very er so I don't know what her salary is but good
B	yeah
A	you know and they they don't have kids so they're very comfortably off but that's what you do and it's a very nice house
B	and the only person I write letters to is
A	mm
B	cos I give a test twice a year erm to my first years
A	mm
B	and it's a two-hour test and it's computer programming so they're all sitting there and it's very boring you know and really
A	mm
B	so it need it's minimal invigilation needed you know so erm sometimes I I I'll write a bit of a letter to
A	mm
B	longhand it's she has Facebook now I guess erm
A	well I mean I'm not even when I
B	mm
A	when I write letters it's not long hand I do it on a computer
B	yeah with Word or something yeah
A	Word or something but
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	erm
B	yeah yeah
A	but
B	it's changed a lot hasn't it? mm
A	mm yes I think we probably ought to move if we're gonna actually do this
B	yeah yeah let's head off
