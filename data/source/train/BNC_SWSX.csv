B	very
A	to see where the to just I mean were there was it signposted? The speed limit?
B	oh no doubt
A	mhm
B	yeah oh sorry
A	mhm
B	then all of a sudden it changes it to thirty miles an hour
A	mm
B	because there's an old people's home

A	oh
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	A day's training

B	now the day's training er you it's only available in Lancashire and er and um
A	isn't it
A	uh-huh
B	Staffordshire and Lancashire were is the piloted scheme
A	uh-huh
B	they're the only apparently the only counties that do this scheme
B	so it's comme ci comme ça
A	uh-huh
B	er anyway the guys who did the course who like they they'd drive and what they'd do their function in life is training fast response drivers for the fire service the
A	uh-huh
B	the police and rapid response at airports and all that
A	ah
B	they're really good
A	uh-huh
B	and it was brilliant
B	and er we we were top of the class
A	oo
B	thought it was so chuffed like
B	and then you do a hundred per cent absolute
B	we were  We were  reformed reformed
A	er so what do they teach you on this course?
B	well it's just really good because they take you round
A	mhm
B	or
A	uh-huh
B	so and like you're
A	mhm
B	and a little kid run out
A	yeah
B	imagine if you hit one?
A	yeah

A	I quite like driving quite slowly at the moment
B	oh you will
A	driving up to forty when it's when you can but
B	yeah
A	mhm
B	you know
A	really?
B	I had three tests when I was er yeah three three tests
A	uh-huh
B	and it was er in them days it wasn't so hard
A	uh-huh
B	and er
A	what did you have to do back then then?
B	well there was no theory test
A	no?
B	there was no checking the oil and water and stuff
A	oo God
B	you have to open the bonnet don't you I think
A	I think so
B	part of the test now isn't it? Also er the gear changing was different because er nowadays it's you're taught cos I've taught I ended up teaching both my daughters to get them I both got both my daughters through the test
A	yeah?
B	because they were doing they both were doing hopeless with the instructors
A	mm
B	so then it was down to dad
A	mhm
B	but
A	uh-huh
B	you I don't know whether you've been taught that?
A	yeah
B	but that's allowed now
A	oh
B	yeah er yeah yeah
A	and what was the reasoning behind that?
A	oh okay
A	mhm
B	the cars have moved on haven't they?
A	mm
B	since my Morris Minor
A	I've got a friend who wants to she's got a Morris Minor in her back garden
B	mm
A	she wants to do it up and
B	it's no road tax on it
A	no
B	no no well yeah if it's over twenty-five years old yeah
A	uh
B	but they they're not very environmentally friendly
A	oh right
B	but how badly is the condition of it?
A	I'm not sure actually
B	yeah
A	really?
B	mm
A	what like as a collector's item?
B	er no no
A	or as a drivable?
B	I'm I'm old
B	it was an old car
B	in old black and white films
A	oh really?
B	well it was  it was  twenty-five years old when I had it so

A	yeah
B	you know the buses and the trains are great aren't they

B	the winner
A	oh were there different heats?

A	yeah
B	two thousand quid
A	Cos I was thinking that's not a cheap way of doing it
B	yeah er yeah
A	two thousand quid a night?
B	I think there was er there was probably about three or four appearances I think they end up to win  to win  it
A	mm

A	mm
B	yeah
A	cool
B	yeah
A	I bet you miss
B	yeah well yeah
A	mm
B	and it's quite sad
A	C'est la vie
B	C'est la vie as they say in France
B	what's the saying they say? Es la vida?
A	que sera sera
B	that's that's Italian
A	whatever will be will be
B	is it  is it  er
A	que sera
B	oh no
A	uh-huh
B	but I thought that was an Italian when er
A	maybe it is the same
B	que sera
A	yeah
B	I think
A	no when I learnt Spanish I was able to understand Italian
B	the the Spanish one is perhaps ain't it quizás quizás quizás
A	quizás quizás quizás
A	ah
B	if I remember rightly
A	oh look how international we are
A	multilingual
B	but er have can you speak Italian? Can you speak any Italian? Or
B	have you spoke to? Cos if they can understand
A	yeah
B	if you speak I can understand most of what they say
A	when I was in India and I was hanging out with some Italian guys
B	mm
A	and they spoke to me in Italian and I spoke to them in Spanish
B	oh
A	and um we understood each other perfectly
B	well
B	my er a friend of mine well I haven't  I haven't
A	uh-huh
B	very fluent Spanish speaker
A	mhm
B	one of them now spends six months in Spain or and both
A	mhm
B	so both one of them'S done Italian one's done er Spanish
A	mhm
B	italian company
B	I'll speak you know er it's not too
A	oh no
A	then again the technical words tend to be quite similar to the English
B	yeah
A	really?
B	they stood  they stood  for it
A	she she couldn't pull it off
B	er she er they just accepted her you know
B	Cos er none of them could speak English anyway
A	well I was teaching English to this guy in Spain who said I've got this conference
B	huh
A	of the regional government
B	oh yeah? Yeah
A	and he said oh I've got this um conference
B	yeah
A	swap best practice
B	senegalese probably
A	from
B	mm
A	would you be up for coming for these two
B	as a go-between
A	two days and just be the person who
B	mm
A	anyone has any language problems? I said yeah no problem  no problem  Okay I get there nine o'clock on the first day
B	uh-huh
A	er interpreting booth
B	oh a proper one? Oh no
A	A proper one with the headphones
B	and you have to be
A	mouthpiece
B	you have to be quick don't you
A	oh my life
B	mm
A	I er the way he kind of told me about it it was just to be there in case anyone had any problems with vocabulary understanding
B	er yeah yeah
A	thought it would be the odd translation and the odd whispering into someone's ear
B	so you got so English is coming through and you've gotta do French and?
A	no
B	oh so oh God
A	which you
B	native
A	oh do you know what I did though? Er cos I mean when you're in the booth you have to have about five different thought processes going on at the
B	mm
A	listening attending to the Spanish and then your French
B	yeah yeah
A	at the same time you have to be listening ahead
B	that's er
A	then got completely behind
B	pretending pretending that there was a problem with the
A	yeah
B	the
A	but I was so embarrassed
B	that's really
A	it needs training
B	yeah
A	I mean there's
B	yeah
A	you
B	no that's er that's a real hard call isn't it that is
A	yeah
B	because I think if you're
B	er you
A	hm
B	that's the that's when you know you're getting somewhere
A	which I can do fine when it's no pressure
B	er so well you cos you see you probably have to go through in your head to Spanish to English then to French
A	yeah yeah
A	no I can do straight from Spanish to French
B	can you go across? Yeah
A	Cos they're quite similar
B	yeah
A	I can translate between them
B	them Senegalese though they can they tend to speak a lot of
A	mm
B	and they've got a couple of tribal languages
A	mhm
B	senegalese
A	mm
B	as well
A	I think people who grow up in a country that has got a lot of languages within that country they're more open to
B	mm
A	learning languages and picking it up
B	in England it's really bad isn't it
B	really bad
A	but I guess everyone around the world speaks English so they don't feel
B	no
A	that they need to learn
B	but it's just courteous isn't it
B	to teach to learn
A	mm
B	and we've got um I I would've thought there was enough people now to teach
A	well I think the problem is that you know they're trying to teach classes of thirty kids at a time
B	mm
A	so you're not actually teaching how to communicate in the language
B	mm
A	they don't see an objective
B	they're not motivated are they
A	exactly
B	mm
A	and they er they have no mm they take no joy in it
B	mm
A	enjoy the whole
B	I did
A	what from travelling around?
B	yeah
A	mhm
B	that's that's how I've learnt it
A	where have you studied at a night school?
B	in in
A	in the Brasshouse?
A	ah
B	up there
A	cool
B	but I found that  that I found that  like frustrating cos I think most of the people who go there go for social reasons rather than actually to learn to speak the language
A	really?
B	and I think also they teach you er er they teach you more on
A	yeah
B	not bothered about
A	yeah
B	how to write it and that
A	with CDs?
B	cDs and er I've got a I I I dunno what it is I've got all sorts of stuff for the
B	I think the the more CDs you buy
B	it doesn't work like that though
A	it's like the keep fit videos that I buy
B	yeah
A	I've got so many keep fit DVDs
B	er no no yeah
A	do I ever do them?
B	no
A	no
B	one of the best things I've found is on the net
A	mm
B	I think on the net you know go into YouTube
A	mm
B	that's pretty good
A	yeah
B	really good that is
A	yeah
B	but
A	definitely
B	speaking the language
A	get yourself a French girlfriend
