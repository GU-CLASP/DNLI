B	you get to play around with gadgets all day
B	oh
A	oh
B	all I got to play around to er with today was a pen and paper
A	that's no fun
B	and a computer
A	I was gonna say it's really a computer
B	really?
A	yeah
B	ah
A	I like a spreadsheet
B	I've been er being distracted by er well no it's not been that bad
A	oh
B	popping onto the BBC News website a few times this morning
A	yes
B	partly
A	or just generally?
B	yeah
A	huh
B	I haven't been paying much attention
A	I haven't seen anything about that
A	hm
B	it's unsurprising I suppose
A	what? What happens you mean?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	hm
A	yeah?
B	gradually
A	mhm
B	mm
A	can't remember what it was gonna go up to
B	it's eventually going to be at ten thousand
A	yeah
B	but hopefully once it's reached that it
A	but yes
B	it's gonna
B	otherwise you know
A	otherwise it's a bit pointless
B	yeah
A	ah
A	does mean that like the fridge stinks
B	yeah
A	and it does mean like at half past eleven at night I'm standing there like
B	what? Have you? So you just? What?
A	can of tuna
B	oh right
B	mm
A	in a tiny bowl
B	half past eleven I was mm mooching around in my mess of a room in the dark watching the second half of Cats
A	mhm
B	I dunno
B	mm
A	oh right
A	nice
B	no
B	mm
A	cats is good though
B	it is
B	definitely a better choice than Phantom
A	yeah
B	er Phantom?
A	mm
B	er
A	er er I love the story
B	I saw it in the cinema
A	mm
B	that was the first time I'd seen it
A	mm
B	or even heard the story or whatever
A	oh okay
B	mm
A	Cos I'd heard
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B went to the cinema.	Entailment
A	all the songs but I'd never seen any version of it
B	I did um see er recordings of some of the stage versions
A	mm
A	right
B	I mean they're
A	mm
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Live performance is better than recordings.	Neutral
A	are all all the actors are redubbed for the songs aren't they
B	hm?
A	are the all the actors redubbed for the songs? I can't remember
B	I I
A	as in
B	I think they must be
A	Cos I don't know if it's them singing
B	it is
[ANNOTATION]	The actors do not really sing.	Contradiction
A	it is? Okay
B	it is them
A	okay
B	but it's
[ANNOTATION]	It's actually the actors themselves that perform the songs.	Entailment
A	who it isn't her
B	it's just a studio then
A	oh I see
B	except
B	oh what? The the the the arrogant one
A	mm
B	oh that isn't her?
A	I don't think so
[ANNOTATION]	The studio is very big.	Neutral
B	oh right
A	Cos I remember reading about it and thinking that's disgraceful
B	and of course she has to be good enough at singing to sing badly
A	mhm
B	or
A	yeah
B	intentionally badly
A	yeah
B	hm
A	but
B	but yeah
A	yes
B	mm
A	bit different
B	mm
A	but um it's the original
B	no
A	oh okay
B	okay
A	the most pathetic individual
B	mm
A	but he's really good
B	mm
A	mm
B	what's her name?
A	the woman
B	yep
A	yeah
B	er
A	I think it was her
B	on stage
A	Christine
B	but er yeah
A	mm
B	um
A	mm
B	partly because she was less vibrato
B	and er obviously
A	yeah
A	mm
B	but you know
A	but
B	yes
B	Cos otherwise I'd be moping
B	yeah
A	cats is kind of sad but in a
B	you know they um like
A	weird way so
B	they recorded a a brand new um song for the
A	for Cats?
B	mm
A	oh right
B	no not  not Cats no not  Cats
A	oh Phantom
B	phantom
A	uh-huh
B	and indeed yes made up lyrics
A	hm
B	but less so
A	mm
B	um
A	hm
B	learn to be Lonely
A	oh dear
B	I know
A	oh my God
B	exactly
A	you've just watched all of that and then you've got that song
B	yeah
A	depressing
B	it's er it's a good song
B	it's nice
A	yeah
B	it's not chirpy and cheerful
B	it's at least kind
A	mm
B	it's um
A	mm
B	er her
A	mm
B	um
A	oh
B	anyway
A	sad
B	hm
A	mm
B	I think I might have I'm
A	mm
B	ah
B	oh no
A	controversial
B	it's it's split now
A	mm?
A	who's in the running?
B	er Jemima
A	mm
B	and
A	who's
B	the Rumpleteazer
A	she's pretty cool
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	mm?
A	A bit more prominent as well
B	oh yeah
B	I'm not basing it purely on that
A	she's er she's a cool cat
B	mm
A	I sort of feel duty-bound
A	to say Rum Tum Tugger
A	but
A	but actually I think my favourite is um the magician cat um
B	mistoffelees
A	mistoffelees
B	mm
A	that is really cool
B	it's terrible in the film
A	um
B	I er I remember thinking um
A	mm
B	it it was kind of
A	mm
B	but in on the film er the all of the lights on it
A	mm
B	kind of flash on and off in in specific sequence
B	it's kinda
A	such a little thing but
B	I er
A	yeah
B	at the same time it's yeah
A	mm
B	tacky
A	yeah
B	oh
A	that's probably a pretty good sound test
