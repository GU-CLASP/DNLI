C	yeah a lady died
B	yeah
A	yeah yeah
C	mm it happened in
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	that's these lorry drivers I worry about they're driving about
B	yes
A	that far away from another lorry in front of them
C	oh god that's terrible isn't it? I know
B	yeah
A	why they do it
A	so that there's a lot of drag
C	the that's it they get in a slipstream
A	it's er
C	and they use it as
A	yeah
C	fuel but you've got to have a mate in front that you know
A	yeah
C	if you if you your
B	it's a stupid thing to do
C	it's daft
A	it's so illegal isn't it?
C	yeah and he knows not to brake all of a sudden
A	well and he can't help it if
B	no
A	something happen can he?
C	well well if
B	what if the car in front brakes suddenly?
C	I mean
B	that's it isn't it?
C	mm
A	well we all know not to brake all of a sudden
C	mm
A	that's not
B	yeah
A	that's not the issue is it?
A	that's
B	no
A	tailgating is the issue
C	yeah
A	which is really stupid
B	that's why they tell you
C	mm
B	you should
A	two chevrons they say
B	yeah
A	we always get into that one in er near
B	yes we do
A	keep two chevrons apart
C	mm well it's it's the same as when I'm driving you're a hundred metres
A	yeah
C	and always drive a hundred metres apart and that way it's nice and steady and you've got
A	it is
C	you do you do it it goes a bit
B	mm
C	like that anyway
A	yeah
C	the whole thing is a bit elastic before you
A	oh yeah yeah
C	if you've got a hundred vehicles in a convoy it'll all go a bit elastic
A	yeah
C	but erm that's safe and it's comfortable just to
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	but
A	but they
C	do you know what they did to get it right for my lads? cos I thought we're gonna get this spot on right so no one could ever say anything
B	yeah
A	mm
C	and when the truck in front
B	I see
C	in between those
B	yeah
C	two you're in the right
B	yeah right
A	that's great
C	you're a a hundred metres
B	that's a good idea
A	that's a great idea
C	we still we did it on the on the vehicle park er
B	yeah
C	put one vehicle at one end a hundred metres and sat in the vehicle and
B	yeah
C	it's now where is it?
B	right
C	we've put two little paint marks on the screen so there you go
B	that's great for letting you know isn't it?
C	you're a hundred metres
B	yeah
A	that's a great idea that is
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	mm
A	they all have sensors now though don't they? they got sensors for everything else
B	it's coming very quickly isn't it?
A	yeah
B	now
A	but the trouble is if
B	yeah
A	you've got sensors and they're only going thirty miles an hour you
B	yeah but if it's a thirty mile limit
A	yeah well if that's a thirty mile limit
B	I mean
A	that's fine but if you're a long way and you're behind some silly old codger that's only doing about twenty
C	mm
A	that's against the law anyway
B	mm
A	too slow
B	yeah mm
C	mm mm
C	yeah I had one of those as well on the way back
A	you do get them don't you every now and then?
C	yeah yeah you do
A	yeah
C	yeah yeah yeah
A	but then if you've got patience that don't really
C	mind you all the roads where I really do think on the country roads it should be forty
B	yeah
A	it should shouldn't it?
C	it should be that should be the rule country roads
B	why do
C	forty
B	they have though?
A	why have they got well
C	well
B	they go up to sixty
A	up there
B	god you can't do it
A	this road they you you can do and people you know that big sharp corner down there?
C	mm
A	they come down there there's the youngsters especially
C	mm yeah
A	they come down there and think that they can get round that big old sharp corner
C	and they go off into the left
A	and they go off yeah you there's there's no end of problems
C	yeah
A	and the poor old farmer across who's who's right on the corner
C	mm mm mm
B	mm
C	yeah
A	yeah they're really silly
B	mm
A	you don't get many
B	well it they want
C	mm
A	you just
B	comfortable driving don't they? that's
A	yeah
B	what it's about
A	you don't want white-knuckle driving
B	really
A	do you?
C	no
B	no
C	but
A	no you haven't
C	there might be a combine
A	might be a horse
C	or a horse might be a bike
B	yeah
C	and you won't get past it
A	and no no
C	might be a tractor
C	doing the hedge
A	I think that road there coming past the
C	mm
A	I think that's the most dangerous road that is
C	well that is yeah people and they do hurtle along there you know
A	they do hurtle along there
B	mm
C	yeah and they push you along if you're doing forty they push you
A	yeah they do
C	I love doing that
B	what? sticking
C	I do
B	to forty?
A	annoying them
C	I do er I don't go I don't go over forty knowing it er in into erm
B	no
A	no well
C	cos you can't you can't see there's no point
B	yeah
A	well on the
C	erm
B	well
A	that start at forty outside
B	yeah there's quite a lot erm
C	mm
B	those speed limits
A	yeah and then then a
C	yeah
A	and then
C	keeps up and down
A	when you get down
C	and up and down
A	yeah
C	mm
A	but that's a bit of a nuisance if they're gonna be forty that should be forty all the way there
C	yeah yeah I think so I mean er
A	the
C	that one forty I hate it
A	it's terrible
C	I won't go on there well I well I I put my foot down and
B	do you still do the?
C	no I stopped it
B	oh
C	I couldn't put up with it at all
B	oh
C	and I I
A	no
C	she just goes non-stop
B	it's funny we but when you switch off and they say they suddenly say well what do you think? you erm
A	oh
B	er
A	yeah
C	well I'm not sure on that one
C	oh shocking
B	or that is right isn't it? mm mm
A	you're not sure?
A	I thought you believed in god

C	you know and now they're going to see
B	mm
A	yeah
C	you know this is it if you're happy until
B	yeah
C	doing that then they go off
A	yeah
C	down completely the wrong road
B	mm
C	erm
A	but then I mean if if you think about missionaries and what have you in the eighteenth
C	mm
A	and nineteenth centuries

A	they've got a lot to answer for they didn't I mean they they literally stopped the tribal way of life
C	mm no and
A	allowed them
C	that was all
A	whatever they want
C	yeah but but it's easy for us to say that now but at the time
A	it is cos the
C	they thought they were doing the right thing
A	did they? well
B	yeah
A	no they believed they were
C	didn't they? yeah
A	doing the right thing
C	well
A	they just want to
C	yeah
A	influence whatever religion they were teaching at the time

B	yeah we must
A	we've got all these these funny little bulb things growing and they come out
C	mm
A	the er cheap peat we bought

B	and then there's
A	yeah
B	a bigger one which has got a a a lilacy
C	yeah that's how that's how it will
B	yeah yeah
A	yeah I know

B	yes you can yeah
A	yeah
C	I did that with my neighbour at
B	oh
C	I and I hadn't experienced them before
B	yeah
C	and I watered them
B	yeah
C	and you can
B	I do it every other day
C	you can you can rot you can rot the
B	roughly
C	erm cos the
B	I always feel
A	if that
C	why don't you punch a few holes? why don't you punch a few holes?
A	there is holes in the bottom
C	oh right
B	mm
C	oh there are? oh okay well that's fine
B	cos they've got canes going all the way
C	well most people don't put holes in the bottom cos they
A	yeah
C	sit them on concrete
B	yeah
A	yeah yeah
B	yes they do don't they?
C	mm mm mm
B	yeah
C	but mm
B	but I tend to feel the feel the top of the compost and if it's really dry really dry

A	if they don't put too much in it
C	mm
B	why is it gonna get in the way of the tin?
[ANNOTATION]	As you press the lid in you get your money out	Contradiction

A	but hopefully you won't
C	but
A	use the whole tin
C	the whole the whole tin has got to come there and then this is slightly

B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	The whole tin needs to be used	Entailment
C	er well or I could put a right-angled piece or something there couldn't I?
A	yeah you could do
C	erm
A	so you wouldn't have to have
C	or
A	that bit lump of wood there

B	but
C	thirteenth to do it
B	do they all know you're doing this?
C	yes

A	well you'd better bring your wood up so that we can get on with it
C	okay I'll sort some out
A	well I'd rather not in the evening cos I go to sleep in the evening
A	well you
B	yeah
C	and I'll just wake you up if I need to ask you something
B	you can do most of it yourself
A	are you
C	I can do most of but it's what you know
A	well I I
C	I'll I'll find all the woods and the bits and pieces
A	yeah
C	erm
A	bring them up this afternoon or whenever
C	mm
A	cos we've only got tomorrow then
C	yeah
A	and we can just do it
C	mm
B	mm
C	well er mm but it's not
A	oh
B	yeah
C	and that was all I made nothing on that
B	yeah
C	but that's the thing about these
A	yeah you just yeah you
C	but also they are they they
A	yeah
C	so by doing having to do it twice I've just lost my work
B	yeah
C	my designing
A	yeah
C	I haven't
B	oh I see
C	I haven't I'm not down
B	yeah
C	on anything
B	right
C	so
B	mm
C	that's
B	mm
C	she was quite excited about this one we might still play
A	well
C	oh well
B	right
C	round on the teapot instead of erm when I've got the dashes in I've just put the dashes from a er er of the same font
A	yeah
C	sat them on the circle and the there was well honestly two one they went right over the top of each other
A	oh right
C	and I thought wow it's worked you see
A	yeah
C	but then instead of on my new programme the first thing down on the list is of erm actions or what what you wanna do or something
A	yeah
C	the first one on my new programme is combined the on my old one is group
A	oh right
C	so instead of grouping it I ended up combining it and it takes a bit of one away from the other doesn't it?
A	yeah yeah
C	and that's what I did so she got a completely white little bit where she wants a light grey bit
B	right
C	erm they didn't get all their money back erm but they they paid two hundred and
A	yeah
B	mm
C	er at
A	yeah
C	and that's worth doing so next
B	right
C	so they're coming back next year we'll get it right
B	yeah
C	but she said I I'm not comfortable with you spending out again and we wasted one banner
B	mm
C	we that's fine if you'd like to give us a little discount then that's fine but we we will be happy with what we've got so I we can just
B	right
C	so that'll save me well I've got I would have to pay out for another one
B	right
A	mm
C	cos I got I've got it I made a mistake I got it wrong
B	mm
C	you know
B	mm
C	but there's this
A	that look like organised chaos
C	that's the final stuff I had to do for the show banners and signs and everything and that's on at
B	yeah
C	all the little bits that
A	yeah
C	come up you know? erm do not remove the straw two of those three of
A	yeah?
C	with with metalwork round it
A	oh yeah I know
C	I don't know what the farmers use them for
B	right
C	he worked out put one on top of the other
B	oh
C	and now you've visited the animals wash your hands sort of thing
B	yeah
C	wrapped right round oh no that was underneath he'd made made basins out of cutting
A	yeah
C	that black stuff
A	yeah
C	chopped it in half put an ends on
A	that's it yeah
B	oh
C	er so there were little where the water water ran into
B	right
C	so you you pushed a button water ran out and you rinsed that that there was er gel and and soap all round and then the waste
B	oh
C	er it it just then funnelled into
A	into the
C	into the bottom one
B	oh right
C	and he just took it and emptied it
A	yeah?
C	and that's now sat in the barn waiting for next year all made from rubbish
A	yeah
C	and of
B	right
C	all bits he wasn't gonna use he got like bought the banners so
B	oh
C	how much well the show catalogue signs
C	all this all all
B	clever ideas
C	that was
A	yeah
C	this was a this was a last bit that I couldn't go without you see
B	mm
C	well
A	they've got all
C	this special special stuff
A	you you go to the the
B	they
A	these little
B	they
A	things

A	yeah
C	no well
B	yeah I I know
C	yeah and and well they
B	I know and it's sensible but you know
C	so
A	I think
B	we lived before that's the
A	yeah
C	yeah
C	yeah
A	but that only takes one person to do it
C	yeah and then it
B	that's true
C	upsets the whole of the
A	and that's it yeah
C	but on the
B	mm
C	on the debrief on the Saturday Saturday night the them they apparently had three kids fell off
B	yeah
A	yeah cos they were
C	well the what are the
