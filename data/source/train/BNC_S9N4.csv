B	it's just silly isn't it you know?
A	yeah um
B	you wouldn't do this
B	yeah
A	um what it
B	mm
A	it's just unfortunate really now that
B	yeah
A	he was the chairperson
B	mm
A	um you know he was and er there's something called planning and countryside officer
B	mm
A	er and um particularly if they're out of town you know he he used to get involved in that to see whether there were any potential problems with footpaths and stuff
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
B	it was just dipping
A	it was nineteen point seven or something
A	it had just gone below but it's kicked er
B	yeah
A	it's kicked in now
B	oh good
A	um
B	yeah it's feeling warm
A	so he'd be the ideal person but of course he's not on the committee and I don't really
B	mm
A	feel I should give um this woman his number cos you know he he's tricky
B	she'll be forever calling him
A	well he's another one who does a lot of voluntary work
B	mm
A	he does hospital runs
B	oh right
A	and I mean he he's over seventy now but he takes um older people or you know people who are less mobile than he is
B	mm
A	um to
B	oh
A	scheme that er
B	what in his own car?
A	yeah
B	mhm
A	you know as expenses
B	yeah
A	to take people
B	mm
A	and um er I er you know he he would've been an ideal person cos
B	mm
A	it's not that
B	mhm
A	but um
B	mm
B	mm
A	you've got
B	yeah
A	which is called
B	mm
A	so he's stopped being er on the committee of our group which is
B	right
A	but he's on the committee of the er area group which is called
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	the er the person who could do it very well is somebody called
B	mm
A	who used to work on the county council
B	oh right
A	on the county council
unknown_female	right I'm gonna pop up the pharmacy
A	yeah
B	alright
unknown_female	be back in a bit
A	you alright? Yeah
B	see you in a bit
A	um and they er outsourcing you know when they
B	oh right
A	you know councils outsource so much work these days
B	mm
A	and when
B	mm
A	er presumably knew her knew about her offered her a job
B	mm
A	which was outsourced because she was retiring
B	mm
A	so the company to whom it was outsourced got in touch with her and said would you be prepared to do your job but for us?
B	oh
A	and that's what she's doing
B	nice
A	doing it
B	yeah
A	um so therefore she's another one
B	mm
A	one
B	mm
A	and
B	oh right
A	so
B	yeah
B	mm
A	you know
B	mm
A	and in fact I'm seeing him after Wednesday cos we're going on a a reccy
B	you and
A	yeah
B	oh that'll be nice
A	he's doing a walk er in about er Monday morning walk you know sort of short walk
B	mhm
A	um so he's doing that um in a couple of weeks time
B	mm
A	so um yeah it er yeah so I I had the my er sort of
B	and it went okay?
A	yeah
B	you got there alright?
A	we hired a little
B	mm
A	but there's a woman called
B	oh right
A	which means she
B	mhm
A	and she gets paid for what she does
B	oh right
A	um and in addition and she's a member of our group
B	mm
A	doesn't get paid for that
B	mm
A	or they're young people
B	yeah
A	um they go to her
B	mm
A	so when I cycled over
B	mm
A	she you know
B	oh right
A	um and she likes to match you know men with men and women with women sort of thing
B	mm
A	and she's always driven her own
B	mm
A	but um when I got there they hired a coach had hired a coach
B	oh that's a good idea of doing it
A	well
B	so who drove then?
A	um well they
B	they get a driver or?
A	yeah they hired it with the driver
B	mm
A	um because in addition to the sort of I mean there's in terms of the um helpers
B	mm
B	mm
A	but she couldn't go
B	oh right
A	at
B	oh yeah
A	so there's four of us er
B	oh
A	um with their families and who else was there? Oh yeah there's a woman er I would say in her forties who doesn't like groups
B	oh right
A	she's a bit intimidated by groups which is  which is  fine you know
B	mm
A	I don't like groups either
B	no
A	um so she came along
B	oh yeah
A	mm
B	in their area
B	mm
A	in their parish church
B	yeah
A	you know
B	mm
A	so it's to give them an idea of what happens in the diocese
B	mm
A	of person who are seeking you know information about the Church
B	mhm
A	as I was er when I um was received
B	mhm
A	and the ones who are not baptized are called catechumens
B	mm
A	that's an old sort of technical word
B	mm
A	and the ones that already are baptized er are called candidates
B	mm
A	male or female
B	mm
A	his deputy er er on official on the official level
B	mhm
A	you know on a sort of civic and pageantry level um er is it's quite strange actually
B	right
A	he sends the vicar general
B	he nominates him
A	okay
B	mhm
A	you know steps down or whatever then the vicar general becomes the administrator
B	so he's now an administrator?
A	yeah
B	why vicar? Cos
A	anyway his
B	isn't vicar an Anglican term?
A	er
B	it's not a Catholic term
A	yeah well I  I think  I think you they er I think it's interchangeable now I think
B	oh right
A	I think it is
B	mm
A	catholic Church
B	mm
A	um
B	okay
A	so um
B	so who was he sort of
A	so he
B	taking the mass then?
A	yeah
B	celebrating the mass
A	well it's the service rather than a mass
B	oh right
A	church
B	mm
A	and there's liturgy
B	oh okay
A	um
B	mm
A	at
B	oh okay
A	um but er the two er people that came with the woman who's thinking about joining the Church er when it came to going up er to see um
B	mm
A	anyway
B	mhm
A	and the catechumens er who are if he decides to er be received at
B	mhm
A	easter
B	mm
A	he has the three sacraments
B	mhm
A	whereas the remainder have um er confirmation and Eucharist
B	mhm
A	and sometimes in fact I think we've got one this year we've got a lapsed Catholic who you know has been er away if you like from
B	mm
A	um er er sacraments and things like that of the Church for a long time
B	mhm
A	um and in the past when she was practising so to speak
B	yeah
A	she was receiving er the Eucharist
B	mm
A	um but they do er
B	oh that's interesting
A	so this year we'll have at least one person er who is um to be baptized
B	mm
A	in fact some of the I think one of the teenagers was a catechumen as well
B	mm
A	to be baptized
B	mm
A	and this woman who will um because she's received that already don't
B	yeah absolutely
A	well strangely not
B	rather than just started up again
A	she seems quite well sort of informed really
B	oh
A	she's a nurse and
B	okay
A	she's a um I think she's a nurse I can't remember is she a nurse
B	mhm
A	or she's a nurse in a er of for people who are mentally um disabled in some way
B	mm
A	mentally impaired in some way
B	mm
A	um
B	yeah
A	um
B	right
A	she's gonna get the other two
B	mm
A	this one is baptized and confirmed in the Catholic faith
B	mhm
A	and she just sort of a refresher really
B	mm
A	but she um she
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	it's just I wonder if she had like a crisis of faith or
A	maybe
B	life got in the way or
A	I mean like people people leave the Church for all sorts of reasons don't they?
B	mm
A	but um
B	it's just interesting if you were
A	yeah
B	to come back
A	mm
B	the classes if you
A	yeah
B	you know if you weren't sure I suppose
A	yeah it's very anyway
A	so we've got a bit of a
B	you've got a real mixed bunch
A	mixed bunch really
B	yeah
A	I mean there were some that couldn't go
B	mm
A	but after being married for a while you know like me er they decided they would
B	mm
A	the they want so the they they've come to our group but they're also talking to one of the younger
B	oh yeah
A	er no he's actually not a Benedictine
B	oh
A	his name's Father
B	uh-huh
A	but he's a Dominican
B	mm
A	stuff
B	mm
A	um
B	oh and he
A	yeah
B	do they not have a church there?
A	well I think what it is they do but I think he's on loan because
B	he's on loan
A	in the sense that um we've got
B	you're down a priest
A	one full-time priest
B	mm
A	well I don't think we're down a priest
B	well who took over from Father
A	er
B	um
A	er Father
B	father
A	yeah
B	that's it
A	um
B	mm
A	studying in the university
B	oh okay
A	but they're only here whilst they're studying
B	yeah
A	um
A	so I mean I dunno whether you've whether you can actually fully retire as a priest or not
B	mm
A	um
B	mhm
A	and Father
B	mm
A	now Father
B	is he?
A	and he's had some he had a really strange well not strange
B	tut ff
A	and they had to cut away quite a lot of his foot
B	huh
A	he he wears a special sort of shoe now that's sort of built up so that
B	oh
A	er I wonder how he managed to do that
B	had he been on a pilgrimage somewhere?
A	well  er whether  er whether
A	that or he had bad circulation and you know it was much worse than he thought
B	how do you get in the  in the  Western world how do you get
A	I dunno how he I dunno how you get that
B	gangrene?
A	yeah
B	mm
A	he couldn't  he couldn't  stand and er and do the things that priests do when they stand up
B	mm
A	um and now he um he's back to you know celebrating mass in a  in a  in the normal way
B	mm
A	but I imagine he probably had to cut back on a lot of things
B	yeah
A	so we have this um Father
A	his name's
A	not a Benedictine
A	um and er he's shown as a resident priest but he's certainly associated with
B	ah
A	mm
B	so um so what kind of font does
A	um it's
B	is it a small one like the stand that they had at St
A	yeah
B	is it in the traditional sort of base and stand? Rather than like a hole in the ground?
A	yeah it's it's basic I mean basically they don't they they what they tend to do is make it up on the sanctuary
B	oh right
A	so it's so that er they can tip water in it
B	mm
A	in front of everybody
B	oh okay
A	um and but for children I think there is one and I think it's at the back of the church
B	mm
A	side aisle
B	mm
A	I think it's the first opening
B	oh okay
A	it's the there's often a screen up
B	yeah
A	um but I think if you look beyond the screen you can see um the font in there
B	mm
A	er Vigil is a big thing they do it all at the front by the altar
B	oh right
A	um
B	mm
A	it wouldn't have the same effect really
B	yeah
A	Cos it is a  it is a  community you know parish
B	mm
A	you know you want everybody at at mass to see what's going on
B	yeah
A	yeah people
B	member of the parish
A	who are being received into the Church
B	yeah
A	you know
B	mm
A	or or one or none
B	mm
A	you know
B	yeah
A	so yeah
B	oh
A	er
B	mm
A	the woman on the phone
B	mm
A	and I said oh er thinking it was a Saturday I said oh yeah I'm sure I can
B	mm
A	and I thought she was just telling me because er I haven't been turning up much on Saturdays
A	which is rather strange cos although she one of
B	yeah
A	you know she produces she puts them all together
B	mm
A	um obviously what she does is e-mails them to me so I can put them on the website
B	mm
A	um and I should know when the AGM was
A	last week a er at the um walks programme on on the website to see that the um AGM um was yesterday
B	oh
A	so I had to phone up
A	um I told you I will be going I won't be going
B	oh dear
A	so it's another year
B	was she alright?
A	so I'm sure I will get mentioned in the
A	in the minutes
B	absentee
A	yeah
B	hm
A	I mean I if you know it depends really well it
B	mm
A	and I don't wanna drive half-way across the
B	well no
A	on a Sunday
B	not in an evening particularly
A	yeah
B	do you not
A	during the day
B	oh is it? Right
A	it's er yeah it's
B	oh okay
A	so so it sort of starts at ten um if you're going you know if they  if they  got the walk first
B	mm
A	you go for ten
B	mm
A	um if you only wanna go to the AGM you get there at two er
B	oh okay
A	and don't go on the walk
B	mm
A	um
B	mm
A	all
B	oh blimey
A	and er where they the place where they'd chosen I can't for the life of me remember what it's called now it's where they've got
B	right
A	you probably won't have heard of it but it's
B	no
A	you know bird-watchers know all about it
B	right
A	um it's at this particular swannery
B	hm
A	um but I tried to get there and the roads were closed off
B	mm
A	er they obviously knew the area better than me and you know found other ways to get there
B	mm
A	it was near Wisbech
B	oh right
A	um yeah so
B	so do you
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	and and I have to go there because obviously I'm
B	you're the treasurer
A	I'm the treasurer and the publicity officer so
B	mm
A	so I
B	do you
A	I can't get out of that
B	do you not need to prepare anything for the area one?
A	well
B	you're not the treasurer for the area one then?
A	no I'm not the treasurer for the area
B	so you don't need to do anything
A	and I'm not the publicity officer
B	mm
A	so all they do is the reports that we prepare for our group ones
B	mm
A	are just  are just  bolted in
B	mm
A	to the um area report
B	oh fine
A	um the only person that actually has to do something is
B	mm
A	she has to go and you know talk about what the group's done and you know what
B	mm
A	we've been doing and what our plans are for the future and that sort of stuff
B	is this the first year she's taken over from David?
A	no
B	or second year?
A	no she's she wants to step down
B	oh yeah you did say that
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	no she's agreed to stay on cos nobody wants to do it
B	mm
A	Cos in the past
B	it's a commitment
A	they
B	you'll you'll be the entire board
A	well um it was before I was treasurer
B	mhm
A	they wanted me to do it and I said no I'm I'm quite happy being publicity officer
B	yeah
A	um you know I I don't know how many years you're supposed to do these things
A	for as many years as you want to but
B	yeah
A	you know you just get a bit fed up with it after a while
B	well yeah
A	um
B	with the website
A	yeah
B	it's a bit of a hassle
A	and I've been  I've been  treasurer for two years now
B	mm
A	Cos I've done two AGMs
B	mm
A	so I think you it'll get to the stage where I'll just get fed up with it and er you know I'll go on the odd walk but
B	mm
A	I'll get fed up with doing it all
B	yeah
A	if nobody else can be found to replace them
B	mm
A	well you know if you don't mind doing it or if you like doing it that's fine
B	mhm
A	but if you want to step down um it's it's like a type of blackmail isn't it really
B	yeah
A	or sort of
B	they rely on your good nature
A	yeah
A	then I won't be okay
A	um
B	it is a big commitment though for something
A	yeah but it's
B	that you're doing in your spare time
A	but I can see that sort of two years down down the line
B	mm
A	I'll probably have had enough
B	yeah
A	of treasurer and publicity er and I won't wanna take on the chairman
B	no
A	but you know I I shall just step down from everything
B	but you're probably one of the younger older ones aren't you really?
A	well um
B	so
A	we've got a younger guy and a younger woman
B	oh right
A	she moved into the area
B	mm
A	and um she quickly got involved in
B	mm
A	um
B	mm
A	er or
B	mm
A	work in insurance
B	mm
A	and went to the
B	do they pay? mm it's not voluntary service?
A	well it's it's they don't charge people for their advice
B	mm
A	um but they do er have both
B	I thought they were all volunteers there
A	but usually the paid members of staff
B	A few
A	are only paid as part-timers
B	mm
A	you know they don't what they try and do is get as many volunteers as they can cos obviously
B	mm
A	the government's always cutting back
B	yeah
A	it's a state thing
B	yeah
A	it's not
B	yeah they're public servants
A	it's not private
B	mm
A	they rely quite a lot now on volunteers
B	mm
A	which means that people like
B	mm
A	either they lose their jobs or you know if they were working full-time they're suddenly told they they're only gonna be paid for three days a week or something like that
B	yeah
A	you know
B	mm
A	I dunno fifty-eight fifty-nine something like that
B	mm
A	and er and somebody I don't
B	mm
A	and he said yeah
B	oh
A	I'll come on your committee
B	and so what does he do on the committee sorry?
A	er
B	mm
B	oh yeah
A	that's
B	mm
A	whom you met
unknown_female	still watching the skating?
B	we're not really watching it
A	that's the um countryside
unknown_female	sorry?
unknown_female	no don't
A	mm
unknown_female	I'm alright
A	um and the role he's
B	okay
A	um
B	oh right
A	er the architect
B	yeah
A	a really nice chap
B	I know
A	yeah
B	I can't believe that's been two years
A	yeah
B	mm
A	yeah I
B	mm
A	one daughter lives in France
B	mm
A	um one er works locally and she's a very keen walker
B	oh okay
A	I often see her walking that way
B	mm
A	in the direction of you know I dunno the A14 or something
B	mm
A	towards
B	mm
A	she walks along there
B	mm
B	wow
A	um
B	mm
A	er she must've gone to university in September
B	mm
A	um
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	oh wow
A	very wealthy
B	yeah
A	in terms of cost
B	mm
A	well er they had a huge Victorian detached house
B	wow
A	absolutely enormous
B	do you think a million?
A	yeah I mean I think they've lived there since the seventies
B	yeah
A	they've
B	mm
A	er they they made it their er
B	mm
A	he was quite well-paid and they bought this huge place
B	mm
A	I haven't heard that she's moved
B	yeah
A	so yeah so
B	oh okay
A	so it's any um changes that are proposed to footpaths in the city
B	mm
A	he he will get involved in
B	oh okay
A	and that often happens because of all the developments in the city
B	yeah I bet
A	people building blocks of flats and things
B	mm
A	they're not always shall we say interested in footpaths
B	profit
A	mm
B	yep
A	yeah so er
B	mm
A	well it's five o'clock so er I can
B	mm
A	I can start putting the food on when you're ready
B	oo yum
A	um
unknown_female	yeah
A	okay
B	are you feeling confident about your homemade sauce?
A	well it's er you know um it's really to see what it tastes like
B	yeah
A	Cos
B	mm
A	in terms of the flavour
B	yeah
A	but they're full of lumps and full of onions and stuff that
B	Salt
A	and stuff that um well I don't think salt's a problem for
B	mm
A	chunks of tomato
A	which
A	I've gone  I've gone  right through the card at er Tescos
B	mm
A	ones
B	yeah
A	er but they all have big lumps in them
B	yeah
unknown_female	they're horrible
B	but when you're when they're all diced up really really small
A	well the trouble
B	that helps add to the
A	the trouble is they're not
B	no but what I mean is when you
unknown_female	I don't even like the flavour of them
A	yeah
B	when you make it yourself
unknown_female	they make things taste horrible
B	no
A	so what
B	onions add to the taste
unknown_female	no they don't
B	why the passata's gonna taste boring
A	all I've um all I've got
unknown_female	I prefer the taste without onions
A	all I've got
B	trust me
unknown_female	I hate onions
A	all I've got is um
B	you don't hate onions
unknown_female	I do
A	yeah well hang on a minute
B	onions
A	all I all I've got is um is the passata and um
B	herbs
A	the herbs
B	yeah
A	so there won't be any onions or
B	but that's what helps make the taste
A	well
B	onions make it taste nice
A	that's why I said will it it would be
B	mhm
A	to see what it tastes like
B	yeah
A	it might taste okay
B	Cos you can also get powdered garlic and things like that
A	yeah well it's
B	that would help
A	it's just
B	you don't like garlic?
unknown_female	no
B	you don't like garlic bread?
unknown_female	well yeah
B	it's it's garlic
unknown_female	is it?
B	yeah
unknown_female	well I like garlic bread
B	that's mental
B	you understand what you're saying is mental right?
B	no it doesn't
unknown_female	Cos garlic bread doesn't taste like
A	yeah
unknown_female	garlic in a meal
B	yes it does
A	no I I I I had the
B	it's garlic
A	I had the same problem because when I was growing up we didn't have er the um you know organic and stuff like that
B	mm
A	you either went to the greengrocers and bought stuff and made it yourself
B	mm
A	you bought stuff in cans
A	um but the subject matter was tomatoes
B	mm
A	she would do a salad and put tomatoes down
A	um and she put tomatoes down and she said right and and ham and or something or cheese or something like that
B	mm
A	and uncle
A	and she said well you eat tomato soup
B	mm
A	so it was the same conversation you two were just having
unknown_female	yeah
A	Cos if you
unknown_female	there is a difference
A	in those days you didn't have all these versions of tomato soup
B	mm
A	that you can get now
B	mm
A	you can actually get tomato soup that tastes like tomatoes now
B	yeah
A	but in those days all you had was Heinz
B	and then that just tastes of sugar
A	so it's lots of sugar
B	mm
A	so what we liked
B	kids love it
A	was the sweet taste of Heinz tomato soup
B	yeah
A	and that's the  that's the  conversation you two were just
unknown_female	yeah
A	having that you know you you can actually um have things like garlic bread
unknown_female	yeah
A	but it
unknown_female	it's not just the taste of garlic
A	yeah
B	but it's  but it's  lessened
unknown_female	yeah but
B	it as part of something else in a sauce
unknown_female	yeah
B	that's mental
B	the thing is with the tomato soup is that aren't any more tomatoes
unknown_female	it makes sense to me
A	mm
B	yeah but you like the
unknown_female	yeah but that's not got garlic in it
B	it has  it has it's got  it's got onions
A	no I don't think
B	it's got tomatoes
unknown_female	it doesn't
B	it's got garlic
unknown_female	no it doesn't
B	it's got basil
unknown_female	it doesn't
B	oregano
A	well if it has got  if it has got
B	it's got bay leaves
A	garlic it's only got a very small amount cos I couldn't taste it either
unknown_female	yeah
B	well the idea is you don't taste one thing over another
unknown_female	we did have one that did we did buy one sauce that did taste of garlic and I hated it
A	yeah
unknown_female	and it wasn't nice
A	no
unknown_female	at all
A	and er
unknown_female	tasted really garlicky
A	when we went to Carluccio's
unknown_female	oh yeah
A	garlic bread it wasn't the garlic that was
unknown_female	yeah I couldn't  I couldn't  eat that garlic bread
A	it wasn't the garlic
B	that was salt wasn't it?
A	that was the problem
unknown_female	yeah

A	southern

A	mm

B	it looks exactly like it
A	well I know  I know

A	I used to go on the train there
unknown_female	Cos I went there every day
A	mm
unknown_female	to work
A	yeah
unknown_female	there are differences
A	mm
unknown_female	so I looked it up and it's
A	yeah I know  I know  what
A	right

B	really? That's good
unknown_female	yeah
B	mm
unknown_female	that's probably a good sign
B	that's really good
A	is it alright?
B	mm
unknown_female	I think you were here actually the last time I had a beer
B	oh really?
unknown_female	yeah one of the nights you came round for Lost
B	mm
unknown_female	maybe a week ago
A	let's try it
B	mm
A	mm
unknown_female	yeah it's alright
A	mm
unknown_female	there's cheese in there isn't there?
B	mm
unknown_female	are you not eating cheese?
B	there's a
unknown_female	yeah?
unknown_female	I'll grate some in a bowl
A	it's in the fridge the cheese
B	okay
A	mm
B	mm
A	I don't er keep a record of how I um create the sauce
A	I just put the passata in first and then I
B	yeah
B	mm
A	and oregano
B	yum
A	and I taste it
B	well
A	half-way through and see what it's like
B	when mum's bay tree comes back to life
A	mm
B	I can give you some bay leaves
A	mm
B	you could just keep them in a jar in the cupboard
A	I always forget
A	I expect if I left them rather than putting them in the cupboard if I left them on the side I'd probably see them
B	mm
A	I'm leading my walk in a couple of weeks' time
B	well I was thinking I'd come
A	mm
B	I came on the last one didn't I
A	mm
B	this one's
A	um
B	oh
A	it's on Lord de
B	oh yeah
A	I think um
B	that's right
A	thity-five thousand acres in
B	wow
A	it sounds like um a very old title doesn't it?
B	mm
A	I mean the
B	very posh
A	er it's just um
B	mm thanks for pudding
A	they used to live in
B	oh I see
A	so it's Lord of
B	mm
A	they've just made it sound a little more um
unknown_female	mm
A	um class sort of upper class really by saying
B	mm
A	um but the title was first given to er the family in the eighteen eighties
B	mm
A	I mean
B	yeah
unknown_female	is this the walk
A	mm
unknown_female	you're going on?
A	one I'm leading
unknown_female	okay
A	and so it's rather strange cos um I thought there was a pub half-way round
B	mm
A	unpleasant
B	mm
A	and see if they're open
B	oh okay
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	The pub might not be open.	Entailment
B	mm
unknown_female	yeah I prefer this sauce dad
A	you like this?
unknown_female	yeah
A	okay
unknown_female	I think you did really well
A	okay
[ANNOTATION]	The female doesn't want any gravy.	Contradiction
unknown_female	nice
A	I'll get the um I'll get the passata
unknown_female	mm
A	managed to find it in Sainsbury's cos they can for some reason in Tescos I can't find if they've got it I don't know where they keep it
B	mm
B	I find supermarkets so confusing
A	searched
B	I don't know if it's me
A	I searched high and low
B	mm
unknown_female	it's cos you the you learn the lay-out after er a hundred times of going there
A	mm
unknown_female	and then they change it
A	then they change it
B	mm
A	to make the idea is that you'll look at other things
[ANNOTATION]	Passata is a type of tomato pure.	Neutral
unknown_female	mm
B	yeah it's cheeky
A	in trying to find what you're wanting
unknown_female	mm
B	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A is searching for some food.	Neutral
A	no
B	to be
A	no
B	that's always difficult to hunt down
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B finds something difficult to catch.	Entailment
B	mm mm mm
A	are you?
B	there's a group that meets
B	in
A	hope it's a clear sky
B	sky is clear
A	mm
B	because they bring actual telescopes for you to have a look
A	yep
B	mm
A	that's good
B	I know
A	oh really
B	yeah
A	oh good
B	it's really clever
A	mm
unknown_female	I always see the same one
B	mm
unknown_female	everywhere I look is Orion
A	mm
unknown_female	whenever I look up
B	that's the only one I know
A	Orion or the Plough
B	mm
A	the Plough is an easy one to see
unknown_female	I notice the W
A	mm
unknown_female	whichever one that is
A	um
B	mm
A	now I'm thinking of onomatopoeia
B	Ursa Minor?
A	no it's it's it's got
B	Ursa Major?
A	it's got an E E in it
B	hm
B	oh okay
A	mm
unknown_female	right
A	that's the W I think
B	Ursa Minor's a um constellation within a constellation isn't it?
A	I don't know
B	or it's oh no it's one within Orion's Belt I think
A	yeah
unknown_female	that's where the galaxy is
B	mm
unknown_female	Orion's Belt
B	mm
A	mm
B	no I don't know er anything really
A	yeah
unknown_female	ask them how many of those stars could be a sun
A	they all are
unknown_female	to another planet
B	aren't they all?
A	they're all
unknown_female	yeah but how likely is it that there's another planet like this off one of them
A	oh actually the the odds without actually knowing the odds must be very much in the favour
unknown_female	mm
B	mm
A	Cos there's just so many of them
B	it's like when you watch um anything with Brian Cox in
A	mm
unknown_female	yeah
B	because he sort of says
A	mm
B	all of these things are possible but it would just the the
unknown_female	you we'll never know
B	likelihood of it happening is just
A	mm
unknown_female	yeah
B	so slim but you
A	mm
B	can't say for certain that it won't
unknown_female	yeah
B	possible
unknown_female	it's Schrdinger's cat
B	mm
unknown_female	I only know these things from watching
unknown_female	the Big Bang Theory
A	big Bang Theory
A	mm
B	it's the only bit of television that isn't rotting your brain then
unknown_female	mm
A	on on one of the channels I can't remember which one they've got um a UFO er
B	mm
A	but they're about you know er creditable sightings rather than the you know
B	crackpots
A	the ones yeah who may think are a bit odd
B	in Roswell
A	um and um the one last week was about an American physicist who claims he was working on an alien craft which landed er somewhere somewhere in
unknown_female	in Roswell New Mexico
A	well it wasn't there
B	mm
A	it was er
B	right
A	um and a lot of the sightings they believe er of flying saucers in the area they they they did move it to a desert area
B	mm
A	actually
unknown_female	area 51
A	area 51
unknown_female	I'm sure that's Roswell
B	that is
A	oh is it?
unknown_female	that's the same story
B	yeah
A	oh is it? Oh right
unknown_female	roswell in New Mexico
A	they did move it to a desert area to keep it out the way of everything but
B	mm
A	of course they wanted to you know if they could do anything to it to get it flying they wanted to test it
B	yeah
A	but of course you know even if you go to desert area somebody's gonna see it
B	yeah
A	so they've had sightings
B	yeah
A	so
unknown_female	yeah but there's always one guy and you don't you never know whether whether to believe him
A	mm
B	oh I really like that film
unknown_female	there was one guy
A	mm
unknown_female	who claims to this day that he was on Apollo 20
A	yeah
unknown_female	which the American government say never existed
A	yeah
unknown_female	but he said he went to the moon and he saw those spidery rock
A	mm
unknown_female	crab
A	mm
B	mm
unknown_female	things
A	mm
unknown_female	and he saw that the Russians did get to the moon
A	mm
unknown_female	he claimed it a long time before
B	well the film is based on that um conspiracy theory isn't it
unknown_female	mm
unknown_female	of that  of that  um episode or whatever you wanna call it
B	those spider babies
unknown_female	mm
A	it is a bit gruesome though
B	mm
A	what happens you know what er the film depicts happening
B	mm
A	to the astronauts
B	mm
unknown_female	you er you know er you can look at it both ways
A	no
unknown_female	the people that actually got there
A	mm
unknown_female	because they were scared of something
A	mm
unknown_female	and they didn't wanna go back
B	mm
A	well there there might have been
unknown_female	but then er you know that's just one theory
A	mm
unknown_female	once
B	that's true
unknown_female	we got to the moon we didn't wanna spend that much money again
B	mm
B	mm
unknown_female	mm
A	you know that
A	that er having got there and got back perhaps they didn't wanna chance doing it
unknown_female	yeah
A	twice
unknown_female	so I think
B	yeah
unknown_female	on the moon
unknown_female	got
A	have been scattered around the earth
unknown_female	brought back and given to
A	mm
unknown_female	and people like that
A	mm
B	which is great
unknown_female	so there's spidery rocks in Afghanistan and
A	yeah
unknown_female	Libya and places like that
A	yeah
B	so they're just gonna rise up one day are they?
A	I mean if you um if you
unknown_female	thanks dad
A	Good
A	and have
A	had it on your mantelpiece
B	mm
A	you know would you  would you
unknown_female	I think I would
A	I I imagine you probably would
unknown_female	mm
B	in the fire
A	mm
B	no that's fine
unknown_female	is that because you were talking about salad?
B	sorry?
A	what's that?
unknown_female	is that because you were talking about nan giving you
A	what's that?
unknown_female	salad?
A	yeah it was in my mind
unknown_female	telling you  telling you
A	it was in
unknown_female	to eat the tomatoes
A	it was in my mind
A	actually
A	do you like?
unknown_female	well I don't mind tomatoes
A	do you like tomatoes?
B	no I don't like tomatoes
A	okay
B	I mean I don't like raw tomatoes
A	Cos I was gonna warn you that cos quite strange what
unknown_female	mm
A	Heinz tomato soup tastes nothing like tomatoes
B	mm
unknown_female	yeah
A	well the these have got it
B	mm
A	and normally when
unknown_female	mm
A	what I tried to do was not buy English ones cos English tomatoes have got a strong taste
B	mm
A	and buy the small round ones
B	mm
A	cherries tomatoes
B	mm
A	or sweeter
B	mm
A	mm
B	Don't like them
A	mm
unknown_female	mm
B	mm
A	mm
B	mm
A	Don't you like olive oil?
B	I do just not not not on my salad
A	really? That's where you put it
B	in the pan
A	oh you can do that yeah
A	Cos people um toss salad in olive oil and balsamic vinegar but I
B	mm
A	inegar upsets my stomach
B	mm
A	so
B	oh I tend tend not to have anything if I have it with salad
A	sorry?
B	I tend not to have anything
A	mm
B	I suppose you can get vinaigrettes can't you
A	yep
B	mm
A	mm
B	mm
A	mm
B	hm
A	oh
B	what's the matter?
A	I've got a letter for you
B	for me?
A	mm
B	is it a cheque?
A	it's a well it's
B	oh right
B	mm
B	better than nothing
A	well it is Lent
B	it is Lent
A	have you gotta send it off to them?
B	yeah you just put it in the package and then they send you a cheque
A	right
B	if I give it to
A	yep
B	do I have to write to Amnesty or can I give it to you?
A	no
B	okay
A	have a oh are you still eating? I was gonna say have a seat over there and just relax on this seat if you want
B	yeah
A	you can have the soft seat now cos I'll swap over and I'll sit on the one erm
B	oh if you're sure
A	oh yeah yeah
B	mm
A	forget all about it
A	yes it's a nice phone
B	it's good isn't it?
B	yeah
A	mm
B	yeah
A	mm
B	is they give you this shell
A	yeah
B	and then on the front they give you a sticker to put over the
A	mm
B	the screen so it's scratch-proof
A	mm
B	once you
A	mm
B	actually
A	mm
B	turn it on
A	such a big thing isn't it?
B	I know it's massive
A	mm
B	it's er seems if you put it to your ear like it seems so strange to
[ANNOTATION]	something massive that not suit to ears	Neutral
A	mm
B	to talk on it
A	it's I think
B	mm
A	but um what's happened to mine is
B	it's got scratched
A	can't see it so well in here
B	yeah
A	so I was  I was  thinking of something like that
[ANNOTATION]	The last speaker was looking for the tools like that	Entailment
B	mm
A	and her deal
B	yeah
A	er is that if if you go to I think I'm right
B	mhm
A	which I have
B	um I don't know that about packages you know
A	hmm
B	home packages
A	I'll I'll have I'll be
B	but it's it's worth speaking to them about
[ANNOTATION]	not sure about the packages	Neutral
A	I'll be speaking to mum at some stage so I can
B	or I could give you my phone
A	yeah I didn't I wasn't thinking that
B	I could wipe that one and give you that
A	mm
B	well I mean I
A	but it probably won't work because you have to get them unlocked don't you? Like you cos your
B	tut oh you're with Virgin
A	no I'm with um T-Mobile you see that's why I was thinking of Virgin
B	oh
[ANNOTATION]	The issue that A has is because of the T-Mobile or something else	Neutral
A	so what I might do next time I go into the city centre or in fact I could do it online couldn't I?
B	mm
A	is just see whether there's any reference on their website to a deal
B	mm
A	have you found AuthorHouse?
[ANNOTATION]	The last speaker want to solve her issue online but not sure does it work or not	Neutral
B	yeah
A	oh right
B	is it?
A	Don't know
B	AuthorHouse exists to help authors achieve success
A	yeah
B	probably just get some cheap you know product at the end of it that doesn't look very professional
[ANNOTATION]	AuthoHouse is not gonna help any one	Contradiction
A	mhm
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	sounds dubious
A	well I'd be nervous about
B	bookshop
A	putting any money up I think
B	well
A	I mean if they wanted to um see what they could do touting it around well fine
B	mm
A	because presumably with your authors I mean a lot of your authors are probably dead
B	mm
A	they you know they write the material and you sell it on their behalf
B	well er in because it's reference and because it's a specific market rather than accept submissions they commission
A	yeah
B	so they'll look at the market and speak to the schools and
A	yeah
B	see what they what
A	mm
B	particular
A	yeah
B	you know
A	yeah
B	and then based on
A	but when
B	that market research they'll commission the product
A	when they  when they  do a commission they don't say to somebody look you know we've got lots of schools that want a book on you know syntax
B	mm
A	therefore you know er if you're prepared to um um pay us you know a thousand pounds
A	er we'll we'll get them to publish you know
B	no
A	we'll publish it and sell um sell it so it's
B	it's the same contractual deal that you'd have
A	you you don't you  you don't  you don't do that do you?
B	no
A	what what
B	they get a fee and then they get royalties
A	yeah
B	they certainly don't pay
A	yeah
B	I mean it's a very small world
A	whereas with this one I imagine you have to pay them
B	it's yeah it's a bit
A	does it say that?
B	it doesn't it's a bit unclear
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	if you look at bookshop
A	so it's money up front and what sort of product
B	mm
A	ask whether they've got any samples of what the
B	mm
A	finished product looks like
B	yeah
A	or is there anything they could
B	yeah
A	have you heard of any of the top sellers?
B	no
A	oh right
B	mm
A	that's going to er that's gonna equal J K Rowling isn't it
B	mm blimey
A	that is very much a limited limited market but yeah
B	it's just cheesariffic
A	mm
B	it really is
A	mm
B	because there's no money
A	yeah
B	they're not gonna
A	yeah
B	pay money are they to get a professional
A	the they're not
B	cover designer
A	they're not gonna get  they're not gonna get  er a
B	tut no
A	not for four hundred quid
B	no
A	five hundred quid or whatever it was
B	huh
unknown_female	previously on Lost
A	on Lost
