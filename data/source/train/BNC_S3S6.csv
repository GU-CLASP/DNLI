A	exactly erm I'm always pushing Dufus I'm like come on Dufus I can't breathe
A	but sometimes she she comes around erm on my pillow
B	yeah
A	and if my head is covering the whole pillow she stands there and stares at me
A	and I'm like are you serious? like can you go? and if I push her she'll come back around to the other side and she just stands there staring at me so then I have to move and then she'll sleep and put her head on my forehead but when she gets really comfy she'll turn around and put her body on my whole face
A	and I I literally suffocate
B	I know oh my dog does that but he I think he my dog did it that like when I was sleeping downstairs
