A	even though Sid Vincent is quite funny you have to admit
E	yeah
B	they're some films I think they should just be left

E	apparently people were walking out when they realised it was a musical
D	really?
D	like you know people walked out of The Artist when they realised it was a silent film
B	yeah
D	I sort of like musicals
E	it's like how can you not know it's a musical before you go in it's like
D	I just don't know how that film would work?
E	what? The silent film
D	yeah
E	why?
B	A silent musical?
E	no a silent film
C	silent film
B	ah I was thinking how does a silent musical work?
E	the thing is there is
C	yeah
E	right at the very end
D	have you seen it?
E	no I've I've seen bits of it but have you not seen the dog?
B	no
E	the dog's so cute like you pretend to shoot it and he  and he  kinda goes waa and falls over it's the best
C	no but like I can
D	oh yeah
C	like there was at least ten to fifteen years of film before sound was invented
D	oh yeah
C	I'd at least be prepared to give it a go like
D	I just don't like it'd annoy me though like looking and
A	how long are they?
F	pornographic films
B	oh
E	I can't say I've watched many of them in my time but what about you
D	what did you say?
E	well you got the expert knowledge on that so
B	I was gonna say?
E	I'll pass this over to you
B	think of a title
C	let's move on
A	let's swiftly move on
D	what's your favourite film that you could think
A	I've already said mine and it's Mrs Doubtfire I picked
D	I don't know I've got tonnes
A	I've got loads as well
E	some of the eighties films were brilliant
B	have you seen the film The Life of David Gale?
C	yes
E	no
B	it's really good
D	is that the one where he kills himself?
C	yeah
D	or pretends that he did committed a murder but
B	yeah it's
A	I didn't enjoy watching that
C	for for an epic film like an epic
E	but I like some of the ones that are really not rubbish but you know the ones you go back on now and think how do people find this really good cos the graphics on it's rubbish and the special effects are rubbish
B	oh
E	you can quite clearly see on some of it where they do this thing where they're looking
C	yeah
E	through that like talisman thing
D	it's still good though
E	yeah I know it's still a really good film
B	did anyone have to watch like Macbeth?
E	which Macbeth?
B	they made us watch loads of different Macbeths and I was like
C	well there's so many different versions
F	oh yeah there was one so funny oh
B	there's one where this sword right it's like a little dagger but there were such crap graphics that you can see like the strings moving
B	hilarious
F	no it was just the way she did it and
B	I can remember it
F	you could
E	we uh we watched you know the new version of Romeo and Juliet the one with em Leonardo DiCaprio
D	killed
E	we were watching that in year nine
C	we were watching that
E	they were in set one I don't know how
E	common sense
D	some people have that
E	no it was good  it was good  but
D	baz Luhrmann?
E	no
D	I like that one
E	the old one with like uh I want to say
C	I don't know
E	something like that
C	has anyone ever seen Metropolis?
E	no
C	no okay
E	is it just an Irish thing that you see these films
C	seeing like it's an avant-garde German film no
D	I still reckon that French film we watched is is a
E	why?
B	Cos you didn't know then that in my head I was thinking I know who this person gonna be
E	uh this film was so good
E	it's crap and if you
D	english dubbed
B	I hate dubbed films
E	I know
B	and it
C	sometimes dubbed films can be so good
E	no
D	because of they're that bad?
C	yes
E	this one's really this one's so much better in French it was
B	but at the beginning
E	it's called uh He Loves Me He Loves Me Not
B	he Loves Me He Loves Me Not
E	and it's not violent at all
B	ah
D	it's the it's just the creepiest thing ever
E	Cos honestly it's
D	I think I might have to watch this cos it just sounds
E	she was watching it it's like I already told you what happened and she forgot what happened and then about halfway through
B	I was like ooooh
D	it all changes and she kind of went oh oh no that's horrible
B	but I did get it
E	but it's
D	oh don't give out any clues I'm like ah
B	you said so
D	that's not even the worst bit you'd enjoy it
B	that's not the worst bit
E	you'll you'll enjoy it honestly
B	does she remind you of somebody we all know?
E	she's it it's like you know how she was in that? You know how she was like in Amelie where she was a little bit odd in that?
D	yeah
E	it's like that so that if she was actually crazy
B	what's the bunny boiler film?
E	ooh
D	ah
E	fatal Attraction
B	that's the one
A	that's the one
B	I've never even seen that but I'm not a fan of
E	I've not seen it
C	it's really really
B	it's the part with the tail
E	what I'm trying to think of other ones that have done that like you know when
D	hmm
E	there have been
D	God there has been
E	tonnes of them but
B	I remember in media they told us that when you like you know
E	something
B	is
B	that's what they change it to
D	what film's that on?
B	in media when they change like redub things?
D	no
B	ah
C	foreign films when they redub foreign films or is they redub an English film for a  for a  foreign market
E	we used to always watch
B	and they sometimes change the things on it
D	yeah
E	it sounds so much better
D	have you put eye shadow on?
A	yes she's just got one eye done
C	you look
E	you were lucky
B	oh I loved that film
E	which one?
B	me and you do you remember when we bought this cake?
E	what's it about? What's it about she gets cake quite a few times
C	Ferris Bueller's Day Off
B	no
E	that is a really good film
C	Cos I was gonna say
D	the Breakfast Club
E	the Breakfast Club
B	that was good that
C	that was
B	lost Life
D	yeah
E	that was fine but The Breakfast Club is so good
D	I haven't seen that one either
E	have you not seen The Breakfast Club? It really cos that song by Simple Minds I sin it which it was
B	pretty in Pink's good
E	eh what else was the other one I was thinking of? Sixteen Candles
A	I like Grease
D	grease is good
C	what?
E	sixteen Candles
B	I didn't ever see Sixteen Candles
C	I actually haven't seen it
D	it is really good cos it's got Molly Ringwald in it again and the you know the guy out of The Breakfast Club that's the really nerdy one?
C	yes
D	he's such a pervert in this thing Sixteen Candles it's really funny
A	one set of my favourite movies are Harry Potter and I know it's like dead for you
D	I don't really care cos I'm a massive fan of the books and brilliant
A	you can geeky out a little bit on them can't you but
E	A little bit
B	I've seen Lord of the Rings just drags for me I fell asleep

B	oh my god
E	it's so good
B	I've got
B	it depends some of them are three and a half
E	it does drag
D	I watched a four hour film before
E	what was that one?
D	it was um a Japanese one
E	oh it would be wouldn't it?
D	it was something love something that was
D	Cos it's got different chapters
E	oh yeah

E	because I've seen because I've been brought up on things like the Italian Job when you see things like fast and
E	what?
E	no I've not seen it
D	well that's
C	Don't you tell me you've never seen
E	no but I've just realised I've seen a really it's not a rubbish film

B	really
E	what was it called? Close Encounters of the Third Kind

E	no
D	oh I think you can only watch that once though cos as soon as you know
B	is this?
D	it's like ruined
E	I always watch like the really obscure films not like the really popular ones
A	has this ever happened to anyone? You've watched this film like so many times and you watch it after ages and you're like I didn't know that happened or you
E	or you start spotting little things
A	yeah and then you start spotting little things like I remember watching Doctor Who and then there was like torchwood like written on the wall and I was thinking
D	I've just realised that torchwood was an anagram of Doctor Who
C	see that that
A	I know but as in
E	no I'm sort the worst
C	every time I watch it I know that
B	I might try and watch it again and see if can like
E	not really
D	is that with vampires is that blade?

E	greedy thing

B	I was crying when he
C	what are you talking about?
E	you know the end of Titanic when she's lying on like the wardrobe door there was plenty of space she could have moved over
C	oh yeah
B	Titanic
B	or they could have taked it in turns
E	yeah exactly
C	or the guy who was with the British
A	but then there wouldn't have been  but then there wouldn't have been  a film
E	yeah because we know what actually happened we can only the only things we can really argue about was the stuff that didn't happen which was the stuff that she could have moved over cos she's not got that fat an ass
D	like Captain Pugwash?
E	A little bit like that the so one or two
D	no I'm sure they're not like
E	there's a druid eh you know like a druid kind of like medicine man type thing
