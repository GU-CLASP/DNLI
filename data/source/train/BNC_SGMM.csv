B	oh lovely they like that yeah
A	yeah it's a a nice and easy one
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	without any erm just literally like we went and hid the
B	yeah
A	and erm you know and in fact it was good that they they liked it they enjoyed it and stuff but erm er
B	ah
A	and it was like he had to come and like ah I can't join in in anything so it's it
B	ah that's rubbish isn't it? yeah no that is rubbish
A	it is tough though because at the same time
B	no you know when there's that many to
A	he's not really the older one he's like he is an adult really I mean it terms of
B	no he's not oh come on
A	no I mean in terms of compared to them
[ANNOTATION]	They had a bad time outside in the garden	Contradiction
B	yeah I know but even so you know
A	he's in the kitchen talking to us
B	he's still allowed I think he's still allowed to find something
A	it's quite sweet he arrived er early cos his mum dropped him off
B	oh right oh really
A	yeah so I cos I saw somebody walking down the drive and I thought oh right it's them but then didn't see a car so I thought oh okay and then I saw his mum and

B	right okay well bless you yeah
A	you know I I really didn't want to be doing it
B	no of course not I know I know who does?
A	cos you sort of you know tired and all the rest of it but I so I ended up having quite a late night cos I didn't want to do it so after work you know I haven't really eaten and so I I had some food and then er and the sort of watched a film you know

B	yeah no that's fair enough that's fair enough so erm I've had an answer about erm er tiles erm he says have we got concrete floors so you're using any non-combustible tile but I think I think actually now I remember you sort of said you can put more or less anything down because you know it's already on the tile so I think I think
A	okay so well it's essentially double tile they'll be a bit that isn't double tiled
B	yeah yeah yeah yeah no I I think we'll erm I think we'll just go and get you some things
A	no no let's check though
B	well well the thing is everything I buy from those places I can take back anyway so I can just buy for
A	no no I know but but not all of it us some of it will be on carpet
B	yeah but I mean we're talking a fraction we're talking and inch so
A	okay but if but technically that might be
B	we'll see er er well I do when when he was looking at it he didn't seem to think it was a problem erm so you know
A	yeah I know I saw it
B	how big is it?

A	yeah shall we sit down and sort out CP tonight?
B	erm I don't know
A	I know but it's just I'm gonna have to work like I'm choosing not to work today
B	yeah
A	erm and you know this week there's a clash of deadlines I can't really afford so it's fine but we risk losing you know spaces for things just saying
B	yeah yeah yeah I know I know I know I know
A	when is it? oh we're doing it bit later on April?
B	er yeah yeah yeah but
A	okay but still probably
B	yeah yeah but I mean I'm not I'm not interested in doing that much anyway
A	fair enough well I know but I thought the things we did last time actually worked really well
B	yeah some of them did and some of them didn't you know?
A	well what didn't?
B	well the entertainment thing was fine but I don't necessarily want to do that again and the oh have I got a drink?
A	you said something about fizzy water?
B	yeah
A	right this is never fizzy do you want fresh fizzy water?
B	yeah thing is I
A	okay
B	as you seem to have gone out and got yourself a drink and not thought about me
A	sorry I didn't really I thought
B	no that's fine that's not a problem
A	sorry I thought you'd sort of said oh I'll just have fizzy water like it was there or something okay
B	right yeah I'll do it myself
A	although not
B	cheers right so anyway do you want to watch that film tonight?
A	I still don't know what it's about
B	erm I dunno a man had some something bad and then he becomes good is it that?
A	well yes I suppose
B	let me let me check
A	well IDMB it or something
B	I can't remember what it's called erm
A	I think I did IMDB it when I saw it
B	it's something like it's got a number in it like
A	oh it's to do with erm like Helsinki or something
B	yeah maybe
A	no it was like erm not Iceland but somewhere Sweden or Norway?
B	certainly it's certainly er Scandi erm
A	is it about a murder?
B	my
A	exactly that's what yeah something to do with
B	okay so it says everybody deserves a second change Oslo August thirty-first is about one man's past mistake and his last chance for salvation it's described as a staggering work of genius
A	okay
B	so I mean there you are you know
A	don't raise my expectations
B	well no I mean you know it's got four stars
A	staggering genius
B	from everyone er seven point six out of ten on IMDB that's not brilliant is it?
A	well pretty good well yeah for a foreign film cos they're biased
B	recovering
A	can I see it sorry?
B	ouch
A	sorry
B	er yeah so oh er there there's one customer review er on Amazon an excellent film I nearly gave up on it at the beginning but I stuck with it very thought-provoking and moving oh tissues at the ready then so there we are that's what we've to sounds fun doesn't it?
A	sounds like a classic Sunday
B	sounds uplifting well you know if we start it soon we might have time to top it off with comedy if it's gonna be that depressing it might need a little something to er
A	don't think we've got time for a film and comedy
B	we have it's only an hour and a half and it's only eight o'clock
A	oh as in like a comedy
B	yeah a half-hour one
A	cos I put some I put some sort of comedy shows on our watchlist which I think we should definitely attempt to watch
B	yeah
A	yeah?
B	yeah maybe depends what they are
A	by the tone of your voice
B	it depends if they're any good
A	well they were like comedians that we would like
B	right okay
A	Sean Lock Eddie Izzard
B	are they short?
A	well no they're like they're shows
B	oh I see right oh
A	they're probably like they're like you know releases for probably a whole show in a tour erm there was another guy I think we've we've quite enjoyed found him quite funny forgotten what his name is and er Hunter D Thompson no Hunter S Thompson Reginald D Hunter whatever his name is
B	mm
A	he's one we
B	yeah no it all sounds
A	did we go and see oh no we didn't see him in
B	all sounds good all sounds positive
A	basically
B	no I was watching erm Tracy Ullman's show erm just a sketch show I don't know if we've seen some of her stuff before but it was quite it was quite funny there was a couple of sort of good you know characters so I've seen episode three so we could watch episode one and two tonight they've got erm and American couple that are you know obviously on holiday here and and generally sort of going into everywhere sort of saying oh my god it's so quaint it's so amazing you know look looking at all this naff stuff erm
A	yeah
A	good
B	I'd watch it again so I was nattering through it so
A	yeah
B	if you like the first and second one I'd happily watch the third one with you
A	that's the problem with watching anything with that's the thing that annoys me is like when when your sister comes we'll often spend a lot of time watching TV when I would normally want to just chat
B	mm
A	but then you just chat through TV but not about anything
B	well
A	so I'm there going well I'm either going to watch this or join in the chat
B	we're quite working class
A	er you're not working class
B	well it's a working-class habit isn't it?
A	you're an aspiring working-class person
A	well it's what people do
B	hang on a minute hang on a minute how many packets are you doing here?
A	three I always do three
B	mm mm go on then
A	check erm yeah but like you know Gogglebox has normalised talking through TV
B	well you basically well no it I think it shows the quality of the TV you're watching if you're watching something really decent if you were watching a decent Scandi murder then we're not going to be talking through it are we?
A	yeah but often we are watching things that you have to pay attention and then you do oh I don't know what's going on and it's like because you were talking
B	no no
A	yeah I agree on something like that yeah but
B	oh my gosh
A	is that a question or?
B	well I don't well I don't know just because erm you know I haven't really been out there a while so
A	yeah it's fine
B	fence holding?
A	just about yeah
B	it's a bit bulgy at the top isn't it?
A	looking a little bit
B	I know
A	but it's very low that strut
B	I know I know I know I know
A	erm but but the fact that it's low means it's out of the way
B	yeah
A	erm no I think the garden's fine I did a tiny bit of weeding
B	did you? where?
A	yeah check me out
B	I know
A	around the erm
B	oh yes yeah yeah I saw those yeah I ignored it yeah
A	yeah
B	fair enough yeah I mean they weren't weeds they were erm like bulbs sort of
A	yeah grass I think
B	no I think it was
A	I think it was grass actually
B	but it doesn't matter you know whatever it was it's wasn't meant to be there
A	you know when like grass is deprived of of er sun
B	yeah
A	it goes like really thick and
B	yeah no they they were they were bulbs but it doesn't matter
A	they weren't bulbs
B	they would have been I looked at them
A	they weren't bulbs
B	that's it it's not a thick grass
A	they were like they were multiple no
B	yeah yeah I know I know
A	okay then they're not a bulb I've ever seen
A	a new bulb maybe I found a new species of bulb
B	no they come up like when they come up blind like that when they come up fully
A	okay maybe but
B	you know basically they've just spent too long trying to find their way out of the ground
A	I didn't it didn't feel like I was pulling anything big up
B	no no no no no I know but bulbs are you know some bulbs are big some bulbs are small
A	yeah
B	they'll have probably been erm er
A	maybe yeah
B	but anyway it doesn't matter it was you know I would have pulled them up myself had I had more time yesterday
A	oh do you think some er pineapple?
B	oh yeah there is yeah yeah yeah bung that in
A	chuck chop that in? has it it's not been there for months?
B	no no no it's only been there for two days sound good
B	ooh yeah well it's exotic isn't it?
A	it's exotic
B	erm yeah I guess so
A	well there's only two two rings not exactly a crazy
B	two two rings no I think two rings is a good amount of pineapple
A	so it's a little bit random this curry I'm not gonna put in the erm I'll put in these bits of broccoli but I'm not going to put anything else
B	okay fine
A	like that cabbage is a bit sloppy
B	er
A	if I fried this cabbage there's no chance it would
B	yeah no no no no no no no no no
A	no
B	no you know best the last one you made was absolutely lovely I don't know what was different about that one compared to
A	erm it had fish in it
B	what did you do?
A	as opposed to prawns
B	oh yes that's right er what did we put in it?
A	we put erm put er
B	oh that erm
A	pollack
B	pollack yeah that was amazing that was truly amazing yeah I liked that did you eat that mackerel? or is that still lingering
B	no it's still I think we probably have to chuck it it's a shame
A	really?
A	well I dunno yeah I mean
B	how far out of date is it? it's not that far out of date
A	that's the thing I wish they'd have you a kind of indication of how long their best before date is so you know what proportion of time
B	well you have a use by and a best before so
A	whatever cos used by
B	I no no no no but yeah I mean so I use by you're not supposed to go past but a best before you are supposed to go past if that would be a use by and something like that it will be a use by
A	yeah
B	so and use by when? what was it twenty-ninth?
A	twenty-seventh
B	oh
A	if it was like
B	ooh
A	you know if they like if you could if you bought it on the
B	yeah
A	and the use by the twenty-seventh of January
B	yeah
A	then like three days over doesn't feel very much cos all of the variables of fridge
B	yeah yeah I see what you mean yeah yeah yeah no I no and you're right and your right they you can't get those with a good month on them
A	but sometimes it's like
B	yeah
A	they only have two days on them
B	you could easily buy that with a month on it
A	yeah exactly so so
B	so I think it's probably a wider window
A	that's what I mean
B	well what are we on today? it's the twenty
A	you can
B	I can't
A	three days how many days in a month?
B	four days
A	well okay just say three it's easier
B	uh
A	how many days in a month?
B	twenty-eight in February twenty-nine this February
A	oh for god's sake right this is why you're bad at maths
A	roughly thirty days
B	shall I say thirty okay yes
A	okay
B	is that well you can just tell me the answer if you want if you've got an answer in mind
A	right three and thirty do they ring a bell in terms of
B	yes ten yes
A	right yeah
B	so ten percent
A	ten percent overdue erm well
B	if it was three days and and if you're saying it's four days then you just kind of go well it's a third more so probably thirteen percent
B	yeah we're heading we're heading into twenty percent overdue category aren't we?
A	well we're closer to ten percent than twenty
A	the
A	or Tuesday cos I'm going well you can eat it Tuesday but you probably won't on your own
B	so we've got to eat it tomorrow
A	yeah basically
B	at at about fourteen percent over
A	fine well it will be sixteen roughly sixteen percent if it's five days is it was a month but that's a that's an assumption we've made we don't know that that these this on in particular has a month on it
B	oh god
A	the smoked salmon has a lot longer on it
B	oh this is scary stuff I think we should bin it
A	yes yeah it's difficult
B	it is difficult
A	yeah
B	erm there's there's just no one is there? my parents wouldn't go near it there's no on for a balanced view
A	I don't know who do we need
B	I don't know
A	your brother?
B	Delia? no not my brother he doesn't know anything about things
A	yeah you're right
B	erm no I dunno
A	well no that's that's the irony about him he knows a lot about things
B	yeah I know but not about anything like that so I think to be on the safe side bin it
A	yeah I'd be a bit much to make these phone calls
B	maybe we could erm at least open it and sniff it
A	we could do a Facebook poll that's the sort of thing
B	yeah we could do no no open it sniff it taste it
A	okay yeah but then you have to have to hand an alternative meal option
B	we can open it now let's do it
A	no but then that's silly then you really do accelerate it's Berlin to hell
A	you really live on the edge don't you? yeah we could give it to someone else that's a good plan
A	yeah just write seventeen after the January date
A	yeah they freezed this is like you know like vacuum packed you can just sort of
A	I know they are
A	there's also an issue of do you know what I'm going to say?
B	what?
A	the eating
B	oh eating and subtitles don't start this again ah
A	it's
B	do you want me to put well do you want me to put English thing on do you want it dubbed?
A	no
B	if you can't cope with a sub do you want a dub?
A	no no dub I don't do dub
B	hey maybe you can recycle those hey hey hey
A	really?
B	yeah no not that in that one in the in the plastic bags one
A	well you put it in then?
B	I will do not right now look it's even got a recycling symbol so it's bad plastic not currently recyclable but if you put it in with your things they recycle it
A	well look it's the it it itself says it's not currently recyclable
B	no
A	didn't you just say?
B	yeah but plastic bags aren't but they shred them down and they do something with them they're saying it's not currently recyclable in the sense that you can't put it in the recycling tub but they can't take them
A	yeah they bin them
B	no they shred them they shred them and make it into plastic matting or something
A	okay I'm not I'm not like it was just cos I didn't think it was the right kind of you know polyurethane or whatever it's called
B	I don't know any plastic they take according to
A	it's plastic film cos it's film it's not like plastic cartons
B	I don't know oh bin it then if you I don't know
A	no no no I don't want to be you know guilty of ruining the polar bears' habitat
B	well you know
A	we're not back to the mackerel again are we?
A	what?
B	I dunno you splattered something somewhere
A	splattered something somewhere
B	right okay I'll go and get that film set up
A	I feel like I've forgotten an ingredient
B	can I stop this from erm just pressing the cross there or do I have to sign in
A	press the stop button
B	oh hold on hold on hold on yeah I can see it I'm gonna to press that stop button
A	no that's the cross
