[ANNOTATION]	speaker b doesn't want to go with speaker a	Contradiction
A	she was zonked out for the count
B	all day
A	day they said oh yeah she does

B	this is a bit of a worry about did I tell you that statistic that I was told through the hospice? that in two thousand and thirty-five
A	mm
B	there will be one hundred thousand people
A	over the age of a hundred
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b doesn't know about that piece of statistics	Contradiction

B	which is absolutely okay
A	yeah
B	and your memory loss
B	are we gonna live longer and the problems will start later the aching joints the
A	well mm
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a wants to live until they are a hundred years old	Neutral
B	arthritis all and all the rest of it? or are they still going to happen when they would normally happen and then?
A	and you've just gotta put up with them for longer
B	you might pop off
A	dunno
B	we need to do some research
A	I don't know
B	because that's what we need to know because I think the alternative we invent a tablet that we
B	could patent
B	that people can buy
A	and just say my time's up
B	my time's up
B	I'm going and we have produced the tablet
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b is not concerned about arthritis	Contradiction
A	ninety-five that's
B	we'd make a fortune
A	do you think?
B	I reckon we'd make a fortune
A	my mother would have one
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b had an idea for a new tablet	Entailment
A	she would
B	she would
B	she would
B	but it makes you wonder mm
A	that
B	a lot
A	that's a lot
B	because that is becoming of course unless the erm

B	the North Korea
A	the nuclear bomb?
B	it's not nuclear though
[ANNOTATION]	Person B is telling to Person A that it is not nuclear bomb	Contradiction
A	oh north right
B	it's the other one they did isn't it last week?
A	oh I don't know
[ANNOTATION]	Person A is trying to remember when its happened but he couldn't	Entailment
B	or this week mm
B	it's an alternative to nuclear of course if that goes off
A	problem solved
B	there'll be no need for any tablets
B	we'll er
A	be rich
B	goodness me
B	did you hear on the news this morning? apparently gun crime in is
A	I didn't
B	there are more recordings of gun crime in the west
A	really?
B	west
A	I didn't hear anything on the news past the fact that you know it's now not so
A	I was like
B	did your world come to an end?
A	I was like
[ANNOTATION]	Person A try to said that before he was week and now he got experienced and think in other way	Entailment
B	did you think where's the tablet?
B	me and my dad had a good day debate about that this morning
B	because the reason I had to change you from yesterday today which I've still explained
A	oh yes yes
B	well hence
[ANNOTATION]	Person B wanted to change the Person A position	Neutral
A	right
B	excuse me
A	yes
B	wouldn't have time to do that and be there for ten forty-five comfortably so I thought I need to change the appointment
A	right
[ANNOTATION]	Person A agrees to change the time for the appointment	Entailment
B	so I gave
A	right
B	so I was working today
A	but then you had to swap it
B	so I had to swap it so I could have my nails done today
A	oh and very nice they are too
B	no those are the old ones she's got a migraine
A	I was gonna say I didn't
[ANNOTATION]	Person A is going to dance	Contradiction
B	she's in bed with a migraine
A	do you know I was gonna when you started that I thought I'm sure you had that colour when I saw you in Boots
B	that's my Christmas gold
A	didn't I? yes
A	when I saw you in Boots by the photo machine
B	you did
A	and I thought
B	yes
A	I was about to say have you coloured the same colour?
B	when I was being educated
A	yeah
B	I went I know but it was a whole new world to me I was being educated I didn't know you could go in your phone and the wires are even there

A	well I've seen lots of people with that dark colour and I thought oh shall I go that dark? and I just said go on let's do it but I really like it actually
B	it's nice
A	really really
B	I might go for that sort of
B	I mean if we're gonna go for a
A	a step away from black here aren't we really?
B	yeah

B	the dark leaf
A	looking at when you said plum
B	I know
A	yes
B	I know
A	they're from
B	what did you do?
A	well but I only send her a few texts and went for a walk
A	I said you didn't
A	she erm
B	bless her
A	I know cos you know she was
B	well only what you told me
A	yeah
B	I haven't really
A	I had said to her when I saw her and she you know when it had just happened as and she was miserable about the whole Christmas set up and being on her own and blah blah blah and I did say at the time listen my family are all going to watch the Villa on Boxing Day so they're only spending I'll only go and sit with my sister and my niece I said if you know cos she was on on the
B	Boxing Day
A	on Boxing Day I said I'd
B	yeah
A	happily go out for a walk with you anyway she took me up on it and she said would I? I said yes of course I will so we went just down
B	yeah
A	went in the pub had a glass of wine took the dog with her dog and walked back that's all I did that's literally all I did and it was nice you know and then erm very kindly
B	oh bless her
A	have a drink
B	oh
A	erm and and I just sent her a few texts that was all and then she sent me those she
B	I know but
A	yes but it's Boxing Day and people don't make time for
B	yeah
A	people outside of the family on Boxing Day I thought well anyway
B	well I thought about I
A	but she was quite upset and
B	organising Friday night like for you me
A	mm
B	for a glass of wine or whatever but I didn't know I was gonna discuss it with you today see what you thought didn't know whether to do like a movie night
A	oh yeah? yeah
B	so we all come round and put something like erm
A	something light hearted
B	Abba
A	like Mamma Mia
B	yeah
B	Mamma Mia we can get up and have a dance have a bit of a laugh and a giggle and it might
A	oh why not?
B	you know
A	lift the mood a bit for her
B	rather than just
A	she's just
B	sitting and talking
A	yes
B	I thought shall I do like something like a movie night?
A	mm
B	and like do that what do you think?
A	yeah why not? good idea she was down about it again on Boxing Day
B	was she down?
A	she was a bit
B	I asked
A	yes
B	said and they don't normally both come but they did
A	mm
B	and then it was obviously mummy and the three girls she said they had a lovely day and erm daddy came round on the morning to open presents but then er he went and then they her and
A	well that's good then that's good that erm that's good
B	exactly
A	to that
B	but
A	so as long as
B	lovely yeah
A	oh good so she had a nice day
B	cos I didn't know whether to feed it back to
A	well she
B	yeah
A	erm but they seem to be getting on much better
B	mm
A	lately don't they? her
B	I don't know
A	anyway so they both came she said they both left about six seven o'clock and left her with all the clearing up to do
B	he's always done it apparently
A	he's always done it hasn't he?
B	cos he's before now he's slept on the settee hasn't he so he's there
A	oh has he?
B	when they wake up
A	when they were much younger? well anyway
B	I know in the early days yeah
A	well anyway so he came round again to open up to open the presents
B	but it was
A	effing
B	never the original arrangement no
A	no I know it was never the original arrangement so she said you know obviously his health isn't good at all erm and she said you know I'm willing to support him and I'm willing to do everything I can but she said then I I wake up and I get this you know
B	see as well
A	if
B	from point of view if you think of it this is the first Christmas that
B	and he might have seen it as an opportunity of
A	yeah
B	to be able to stay there for the day
A	but on the other side of that though
B	I know
A	they're living in it and how weird is that? to then say oh I'll you know
B	they won't though because
A	well she said she said she thought she might anyway erm I said so you know to go round and see your still existing wife that you've been separated from for so many years in another man's house it's just weird but anyway so you know so from her point of view it hadn't been as smooth as obviously
B	yeah and she got a smile and bright sparkly eyes when she was telling me so all the body language was right
A	but they yes but they er
B	that's right
A	on Boxing Day so
B	yeah
A	he had nothing really particularly to go home to cos his dad was out at friends or something
B	yeah cos he goes to friends for Christmas Day
A	so he had
B	yeah yeah
A	and who knows
B	and that that far into the day
A	er into the day and who knows what his health will be like next year?
B	yeah
A	you know if he's on this transplant list you know versus I know it's not the arrangement I know they're separated I know so you can see it from both sides
B	but if they can go out shopping together
A	well yes
B	what's the difference of him
A	what's the difference in
B	having a place at the table?
A	the well I know I know so so you know it's the usual it's the usual with
B	I mean I I would like
A	sorry for her but she has brought er loads of it on herself but I I do still feel sorry for her but erm
B	what happens if something happens to
A	I don't know
B	go to the girls? cos cos
A	mm
B	he would turn in his grave if if his inheritance ended up on
A	went for
B	oh absolutely
A	well yeah but he's erm he he'll have all that sorted won't he? because
B	well yeah because he wanted he he has wanted
A	yes well well it's I mean
B	because she will automatically be his next of kin if they are still married
A	you're right
B	she's his next of kin therefore would get it and he doesn't want that to happen under no
A	right
B	circumstances
A	and it wasn't until was it who was it that said at your house or was it you? that is that why
B	I never said that
A	so
B	but that could be
A	it was at your house I'm sure maybe it was
B	must be
A	somebody said and I thought what a er it didn't occur to me cos he ended up getting the mortgage
B	mm
A	not a joint mortgage and of course if she's still married to
B	but also
A	he then would own half the house would he? I don't know I don't know
B	no no because it would be the
A	or it could go to some of them
B	names on the deeds it would be the names on the deeds wouldn't it?
A	yeah
B	so
A	I don't know
A	what?
A	you may speak
unknown_female	I need to book some proofreading time
B	oh
A	oh
B	work
A	well it's quite costly these days for you
unknown_female	yes
A	how many pages?
unknown_female	thirteen
A	thirteen?
unknown_female	yeah
A	when have you got to send it in?
unknown_female	er er not till after the weekend
A	oh fine okay then
B	does that mean you've got to do it tonight? after the weekend? so that's either tonight or Monday
unknown_female	no no no it's gotta I need it for Monday
B	that's what I mean
A	well yes
B	you've gotta do it tonight if you don't wanna do it on the weekend
A	yeah that's very true
B	that's
A	oh I we've given it up pretty much for January
unknown_female	she makes more sense with a bit of wine in her
A	right off you go
unknown_female	alright
A	you've had your say
B	erm
A	yeah okay
B	so it would be
A	right
B	but erm for example if anything happened between her and
A	right
B	yeah she'd have to specify that otherwise it would just fall to
A	oh okay
B	on the document
A	right
B	isn't he?
A	oh okay
B	but I think it's probably more because now we're in negative equity so she probably hasn't she's
A	with nothing
B	no profit
A	I yeah yes
B	she's probably has nothing to put in
A	probably not no
B	so why would
A	I don't know but he'd drawn up this trust agreement to give her equity after two years
B	well I suppose he thought they were
A	I dunno
B	they would be together
A	but it didn't last six months did it? since they bought that house that was the worst thing they did anyway I don't know
B	but
A	but thing
B	do you think?
A	yes after my walk
B	so why did he walk out then?
A	I don't really know
B	so he's walked out
A	he left her
B	because it got nasty didn't it?
A	er well yes the atmosphere
B	the influence on the children apparently
A	was awful oh yes yes
B	you know
A	yeah no the
B	no
A	when
B	yeah
A	still thought
B	so
A	out of turn or or saying anything er
B	as it is
A	you know we've had these walks you've been upset I said there's been many an occasion where you've been on the edge of tears she said I know I know but I still got that impression she'd have him back I said well I think as hard as this bit is now you are better off without him
B	but for what reasons would she have him back?
A	well
B	for love? or
A	well I didn't ask her that
B	financial convenience you know
A	oh I know cos there was all the other stuff of how is she gonna manage the school run without him and?
B	how does she manage it on her?
A	I dunno she didn't have a plan at the time
B	well er er when it all first started she was kind of in partnership with
A	right
B	and they were doing either a week of that whatever the arrangements were
A	whatever it was
B	I'm not sure but they were sharing it and in the end
A	give yes yeah
B	and she stopped it and I went
A	how come? do you
B	well I she didn't tell me it was
A	you
B	yeah
A	yes you can see that a mile off
B	yeah
A	anybody would be mad to er to get involved in that type of arrangement she didn't have a
B	mm
A	with everyone else but
B	yeah
A	I don't know anyway watch this space
B	well see
A	no she didn't pass no I don't know where she will
B	is she going to
A	well she wasn't er
B	mm it's so funny cos not long ago
A	oh don't they?
B	apparently not
A	it's performing arts
B	exactly
B	well I didn't pick up on it I was like
A	oh
B	all I could think was it's very astute of
A	must come from her mother
B	and she's kind of read that and she so I was more going down that road
B	and I was thinking oh blimey there's no flies on her is there blah blah blah blah
B	so I was telling
A	well of course it is
A	it's performing
B	of course it's performing art
A	performing of course it is although
B	not paintbrush arts
A	theatre all those theatre productions
B	well I was just more

B	no
A	Mr
B	is he?
A	A level
B	A level
A	PE
B	his assessment
A	yes
B	mm
A	so which is why they seem to be going down this
B	cos I would've thought badminton would be more difficult cos it's so much
A	no but the
B	faster
A	no umpiring not playing
B	oh
A	calling out the score
B	oh
A	at badminton apparently so that's his always his emphasis and he said it's really easy to get a high mark for
B	yeah
A	take it? so he has
B	yeah
A	he's and
B	yeah
A	they're gonna do he said yeah you can take it but how stupid is this?
A	no no
B	oh
A	no erm Mr can Mr
B	oh
A	before he's allowed to go and stand and watch I said that's ridiculous anybody could go and stand on the edge of a tennis court and watch
B	yeah that's yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Person B is going to dance	Contradiction
A	you know he's a teacher at high school but any but anybody could
B	yeah
A	anyway
B	but you know I
A	it's ridiculous
B	er er perhaps because the because he's there on an official
A	maybe
B	status
A	maybe
B	if if the question was asked it may be policy of the club
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Person A agrees that any question is come out is the club policy	Neutral
B	to go and watch is one thing but to be there on a
A	to be er yeah maybe
B	status it may be
A	anyway so apparently the PE teacher's got to
B	I tell you
A	it's gone mad hasn't it?
B	absolutely gone
A	but the funny
A	I know but the funny thing is the group that
[ANNOTATION]	Person A think that he gone mad	Entailment

A	anyway he's very pleased with himself because he's getting away with it at the moment and erm
B	I know
A	did
B	yeah what was your
A	well
B	think?
A	it took me a long time to get there cos he told me he'd walked

A	mind you
B	to the
A	how would you
B	Neal's Yard but it was her clashed
A	yeah how would you bring that up really?
B	with her running night well exactly
B	you know and you think to yourself I have thought about texting
A	mm
A	oh well yes yeah
B	it's not I wanna know more but would she think oh she's only texting me that because
A	no I don't think she would think that about you but gosh see if I then yet
B	I can't think I wanna say
A	you know they always come across as so
B	I know
A	oh
B	I know
A	hardworking and
B	yeah laid back
A	oh gosh
B	quietly spoken gentle I do remember on one of the it might have been one on the of one of the first walks that the school organised round the village
A	mm
B	and I do remember coming across this backtrack and and
A	oh oh
B	you know what I
A	and what age was?
B	well would have been sort of reception stroke year one
A	oh
B	do you know what I mean?
A	yeah
B	you know when you think
A	mm
B	and I and never ever anything since but I've never been in their company long enough I've been in
A	yes yeah
B	or athletics I mean when
A	no
B	I would never have questioned what she said or how she said it
A	but when she was doing when she was doing athletics was she disciplined then? or was she
B	yeah
A	enjoying it?
B	yeah
A	but she doesn't do that any more
B	the only reason
A	no
B	no the only reason she gave up was because she was told she had to make a choice because of the time
A	oh why?
B	more than anything
B	football
A	oh yes there will be that yes
B	and she chose football
A	right
B	because it was just
A	yes yeah
B	is you know
A	time
A	oh I know
B	new racquets you have to replace your trainers more often than you would normally
A	mm
B	that sort of thing erm and she said you know she's gonna have to make a choice
A	mm
B	never once in all the time I've been in
B	oh yeah her behaviour is
A	oh what a shame
B	just just whether you want to call outspoken disrespectful erm
A	it's got to be a bit more than that to get expelled
B	because it was ongoing
A	oh okay
B	it just kept going on and it just be things like she'd ask if she could go to the toilet did I tell you this story?
A	yes you did
B	yeah
A	yeah yeah
B	things like you know like this persistent
A	yeah oh gosh
B	but then sometimes I think you know like
A	oh yes
B	a ridiculous right so apparently
A	mm
B	and the book they're reading is the Christmas story

B	a Christmas story the whichever
A	the Christmas Carol
A	yes

unknown_female	what?
B	needs filling up
B	so
A	anyway
B	erm
B	oh
B	erm so do you create this image person of yourself so it it's a bit like isn't it? that
A	that people are short tempered with you
B	exactly
A	before you've begun
B	before
A	mm
B	and
A	yeah there is a bit of that
B	there's the history of
A	mm
B	or is it that the teacher's having a bad day? being a little bit unprofessional
unknown_female	oh I've found my keys
B	oh how coincidental
B	oh
B	when you look hard enough
A	yeah
B	erm you don't know do you?
A	you don't know no you don't
B	because it I mean
A	mm
B	when she says excuse me miss can I go to the toilet? no

A	I know but they have a break don't they?
B	after they had a break

A	there's all of that
B	I know
A	where you're supposed to by this age
B	be
A	be able to
B	in control I know
B	I know
A	because erm but I
B	well it's like that time
[ANNOTATION]	They don't have lunch.	Contradiction
A	it would drive you mad wouldn't it?
B	yeah it's like that time when she was chewing and
A	yeah
B	you know
A	and
B	and she
A	no not allowed
B	for all those kids that know she's chewing
[ANNOTATION]	People get upset when she chews.	Entailment
A	yes

A	yeah yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B will not do it tomorrow.	Contradiction
B	if she's got away with it why can't I? I said you can't
A	it's one of those isn't it? I suppose
B	she said yeah but mum she would have avoid that eruption
A	mm I know but
B	I said but rules are rules
A	yeah if you've asked stupid questions all the way through to the point you're annoying your teachers your teacher's probably got a rule in their head that says I will ask a I will answer a question that's pertinent and if she'd asked any question about the story or the play or a character she would have to have answered it but not questioning why are we doing this?
B	mm yeah
A	whereas another child if another child had questioned but they don't normally question that sort of stuff
B	yeah
A	probably would have answered it
B	but
A	but oh
B	she's quite witty apparently they were in the maths lesson which I don't agree with this they were in the maths lesson and the teacher's phone rang
A	oh
B	I know
[ANNOTATION]	The teacher has a phone.	Entailment

A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	The teacher's phone rang.	Entailment
B	and the teacher said
A	oh
B	oh it's

B	about three?
B	I know you're telling me off now aren't you? you've used my name
A	I have yes
A	used your full name that's bad
B	I know I know
A	you were gonna go
B	this is why I said I'd go tonight
B	but erm
A	at
B	has he? oh why?
A	well he's decided to cancel it from January but he was still slow doing it all over Christmas he said he was going to I said well go and do it then so he didn't go until January and
B	mm
A	erm I don't really know why he says he's got to start saving his money for driving lessons
B	oh see I pay for
A	mm
B	with her athletics and her trampolining
A	oh okay
B	that it it's still even not the equivalent to what
A	but the well the other thing is the
B	yes
A	and there's hockey
B	he's getting his fitness
A	and he said well actually in fact I don't know whether
A	I don't think so
A	that's what he said did
A	but so then he said I'm gonna use the use the money
B	from
A	yeah no use the money that he's cancelling the membership and buy some dumbbells and just use those and I said we've got a bar and we've got erm you know the weights
B	mm
A	on the end cos we've had those a long time I said you could use those no it's not the same as dumbbells I said well fine cos if it's all he does I don't think he does
B	yeah
A	much cardio because
A	he plays tennis he plays hockey he does all of that
B	doesn't need it
A	he doesn't need it but he wants and is said well fine if that's
B	wants a six pack
A	yeah yeah I said well you can lift your dumbbells and plank for a minute and you'll be sorted
B	yeah
A	so he's he has cancelled it
B	oh
A	but then I don't think he wasn't particularly going at the same time as
B	no
A	get off the bus and
B	go straight there wouldn't he?
A	and go straight from school
B	where
A	cos well because we had to be off for tennis and stuff
B	won't be able to do will he?
A	no
B	erm yeah
A	come home and then get
B	then go back out
B	yes yeah
A	I dunno why he didn't go
A	yes he did
B	so maybe he just thinks
A	yeah
B	I'd rather get everything
A	yeah
B	home
A	maybe I mean
B	did he?
A	in the sixth form he put it down I mean it was only shorts and a T-shirt but it was a nice T-shirt an Adidas one and the shorts were tennis shorts that were part of a set they were just in a carrier bag
B	somebody took it?
A	I don't know he'd put them in the sixth form this was right at the start before they'd been given lockers I think or he hadn't been and got a locker he still hasn't got a locker he didn't want a locker whether
B	I don't think
A	I don't know but he didn't he was never fussed on having a locker but at the time he said no they haven't given them out yet anyway so he'd put
B	that's a shame
A	and he couldn't so he hadn't so he'd lost he'd lost some kit for the gym fortunately his trainers weren't in there
B	yeah
A	because he was
B	did his school shoes go missing?
A	he was wearing them as school shoes
B	oh
B	yes yes
A	those black
B	yes
A	those black trainers so he doesn't need to
B	breaking the rules
A	to carry those but anyway so he's cancelled that but he wants to do
A	why not? I said mm why not?
B	mm
A	I said what happens if somebody you know injures themself or has a heart attack are you gonna get insurance? oh we're not nobody's gonna do that much it's gonna me like our friends ain't like they're gonna have a heart attack at the age of sixteen seventeen I said alright let's strike the heart attack
A	what about if somebody drops a weight on their foot?
A	oh but you know as if like it's just worrying unnecessarily
A	I said also we've got a table tennis table in there and if that when that goes my car will be in there
B	no what he could actually do instead is start up a table tennis club
