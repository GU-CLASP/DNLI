B	but the lovely thing about that programme was it just I find it a joyous programme
A	yeah I thought it was great
B	but
A	do you want your from your coffee in there cos he's
B	erm erm okay
B	no he's not
A	listening to his bears
B	erm
B	mm
A	that's very hot
B	that's alright it's not too hot
A	yeah
B	erm you know? but
A	yeah
B	but erm
A	yeah
B	mm erm I mean he knows his numbers for instance so when he goes to school he'll just
A	yeah
B	he'll he'll just know his numbers
A	yeah
B	erm and er and the er he might be sort of bored at that sort of stage but er not really cos he loves numbers
A	yeah he's actually still
B	mm
A	not bored with
B	mm
A	going through any
B	yeah
A	numbers of the
B	mm
A	he'll still go through the alphabet in a way that I think surely now like a year on he's been going
B	yeah yeah
A	through the alphabet for at least a year and he's done it for a year but he still
B	yes yes he
B	mm
A	go through and say there's one thing that does my head in a little bit so I don't watch it but it's a er and then it goes ant but er and it's got this annoying music
B	mm
A	but he'll still he'll be riveted to that in a way that
A	he won't if there's a Danger Mouse or something
B	mm right yeah
A	or or like a story on the TV that he doesn't know before where he just just won't be interested
A	like and going through it again
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	the alphabet again
B	mm yeah
A	there's er the other group this well mostly American
B	mm
A	er that I've seen as well and they call did I tell you they call it they've got a name for it but it's not actually an official name for things similar to
B	and what do
A	they call it hyper hyperlexia
B	oh
A	er it's like or say the Einstein syndrome or whatever
B	right right
A	kids who er speak
A	quite late but read and are are really obsessed
B	mm
A	by numbers and letters
B	mm
A	like him
B	mm
B	er I think er and there is that little bit in him you can I mean people actually sort of think oh little genius or
A	yeah
B	er
A	it's not that
B	mm
A	there's er bits in there about how people are coping with school or later on
B	right yeah
A	because that's what I find most interesting that how some of them were saying that they were having real problems with the school because they were erm labelling them as erm like lazy or all sorts of other things because they were doing stuff that
B	yeah
A	they already knew or
B	mm mm mm
A	they would gaze out the window or they're one of them had their kids chucked out because they didn't or but then
B	mm
A	other kids have said their schools other people have said they've said nothing to the school and that they've picked up on it and they've been fine and other people have said
B	mm mm
A	that they've said something and they thought they were a precocious parent who were like picking up their
B	mm
A	like a really
B	normal schools deal with normality
A	yeah
B	mm and if you get as there are quite a few of them around erm teachers who actually go with the kid you know
A	mm
B	who can actually especially in the infant bit
A	yeah
B	erm who can go with how how how they are learning how they are doing it erm what they can't really cope with are children who are too destructive in class
A	yeah
B	erm but erm they because you can't really you can't stop everything erm there's got to be a certain conformity erm like
A	yeah
B	mm
B	right
A	so everybody sends their kids to the Irish-
B	right right
A	speaking Irish I thought
B	mm
A	and if he had to learn that all again
B	so would
A	yeah
B	right right erm er how how do you sort of feel about
A	well I think
B	for for
A	yeah for
B	mm
A	I'm not sure that that would be that great for
B	mm
A	as good because they're not they will everyone sends their kids all the bright kids end up going to the Irish-speaking schools all the
B	right
A	best teachers go there all the best
B	yeah
A	kind of
B	yeah
B	yes mm
A	he will will be I think
B	mm
A	possibly and then all the textbooks are erm are in Irish and they're not not as good I don't think as the other ones
B	right
A	erm especially the science ones
B	it is a hard one that
A	it is a
B	it is a hard one because erm certainly at the infant stage erm erm he wouldn't be learning to read in English you know
A	yeah
B	he'd be learning to read in Irish
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	erm the erm say oh well at infant stage as long as it's a kindly school and it's not too
A	yeah
B	bad erm you can go to it because erm the child will pick up stuff
A	mm
B	erm the er but when they're actually learning to read in Irish that's a bit more difficult
A	yeah
B	because erm later on they'll get English lessons but I mean
A	yeah
B	do do erm for instance
A	yeah but you see er I don't think it did
B	right
A	I think
B	right
A	and she got referred to a specialist erm
B	was that reading in Irish? or it's just reading?
A	just reading generally
B	mm right yeah
A	and
B	uhu
A	if you've got some if you've got something that's erm mm not as easy for you er
B	yes yeah
A	then erm having to learn another language on top of it is I dunno it's pretty difficult
B	so would the non-Irish schools in
A	but then he would wouldn't be able to you can't
B	you can't transfer
A	transfer because erm they they would all be
B	mm
A	speaking fluent Gaelic in
B	mm
A	once you go in there they say hello in in Irish everything you have to do in Irish
B	right right
A	and once you're behind that's it you can't join again
B	yeah yeah
A	and the the other streams just aren't aren't as great even with
B	yeah
A	but it was the English side but because you've got no other kids who are erm or very few other kids who er er who are academic really it's it's
B	mm
A	got parents who are in any way bright or academic
B	mm
A	they they'll if they've got a good Gaelic school they they all send them there so they the other lessons though they've got to cater for the majority of the class haven't you? so
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about schools	Entailment
B	yeah of course of course and er
A	so then he'll be relegated to classes where
B	yeah
A	if he's a bright boy that'll be they would just won't be
B	mm
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about weather	Contradiction
A	pushing him at all
B	mm
A	for a long time I mean that that will be quite hard for him too and also just your mates and that kind of thing your mates are more the ones they love the you know they have the mucking around or the
B	you know to talk to them
A	sporty things
B	but do they
A	yeah
B	talk in the playground in English?
A	erm
[ANNOTATION]	they are not sure about speak English in playground	Neutral
B	I mean
A	they the the sides don't meet anyway they they don't hang around with each other
B	no but but I mean all all
A	yeah they talk they talk they often talk in Irish in the
B	oh right right
A	playgrounds not all the time they don't have to but oh
B	cos
A	I'm not sure actually
B	cos when they go
A	maybe they would do
B	when they go to school most of them won't speak Irish
A	when they first go to school yeah so they'll I mean when they first go they're
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about school	Entailment
B	mm that's right you are primed for a a sort of reception class that er
A	yeah
B	er
A	I think there's a year or so with er erm they get if you where they're there's some kind of
B	mm
[ANNOTATION]	person B is talking about reception class	Entailment
A	more in English like some
B	mm mm
A	instructions in English but they really quickly sort of just go into the Irish
B	mm and
A	yeah
B	I mean you
A	I don't know
[ANNOTATION]	they are not sure about instructions in English	Neutral
B	you didn't come you didn't meet
A	no she was nine in
B	eleven right nine
A	yeah
B	so but when she and her friends talk together
A	mm
B	did you ever see her friends talking? did they talk in English do her and her sister speak English to each other?
A	yeah
B	erm the
A	when they're home but erm in school they usually talk Irish I think
B	erm
A	but I'm not sure about lunchtimes
B	erm cos erm er I'm just trying to get get a feeling of what the kind of social setup is in Irish schools do they
A	they'll often the think they're encouraged to speak Irish as much as possible everywhere
B	right right right
A	and that's why they you know partly keep like the sides separate they have separate lunch areas the Irish-speaking side
B	okay
A	and the English
B	right
A	areas
B	right right
A	yeah yeah so it won't be if he if he was if he was just a sort of general child then
B	mm
A	the I'd definitely want to
B	right right right
A	really
B	right which is an English-speaking school?
A	yeah
B	yeah yeah
A	yeah I mean
B	yeah
A	it's not not as good as I'd hope
B	I mean I just know nothing about
A	yeah
B	the setup so erm I've got no nothing to sort of hang anything er say usefully
A	yeah
B	you know on but er
A	it's a shame as well because they don't teach science very erm they don't teach science in primary school hardly at all
B	no no
A	either which is a real shame but kids like him I think that's what he'd
B	right right
A	I suppose they do maths and things
B	was
A	no he didn't he erm at that time it was different here and they didn't have the Irish-speaking school er and I don't think
B	erm cos I think
A	it's new thing
B	erm the it's like Welsh schools it's you know the erm there are certain countries who think oh wait a minute
A	mm
B	we want our language to survive we want our
A	yeah
B	language to become more living
A	yeah
B	and it is a fairly in the last say twenty fifteen twenty years I don't I I'm just guessing
A	yeah
B	erm so people before that erm er cos from when my granny was erm erm at school I mean she talked Gaelic at home
A	yeah
B	erm but as soon as they went to school they had to learn English
A	yeah
B	and er cos all the schools were taught in English
A	yeah
B	and erm so that was that
A	yeah
B	erm erm
A	yeah
B	right right
A	I think he sort of resents quite a lot of time he was
B	yeah
A	he was taught Irish erm
B	right
A	and there's er
B	mm
A	that's what I've noticed more than anything in Ireland since I've moved here is that everyone I work within research they all sent all their kids to Irish-speaking schools because they were academics and
B	right
A	everyone did and people note that I think as well if you go on erm the university and things
B	yes like like erm like in Scotland you could tell whether it was a Catholic school of a Protestant school
A	yeah
B	in erm so erm but just by because you know the schools so that you
A	yeah
B	know if it's an Irish-speaking school or a non-Irish-speaking school
A	yeah
B	and because
A	yeah
B	erm they you had to send him to a an English-speaking school
A	yeah
B	but erm erm and there again you probably will
A	I was
B	erm
A	I was
B	when you were
A	at the time
B	when you first came over?
A	yeah I was
B	erm
A	at the time
B	erm
A	to his school yeah
A	yeah erm
B	yeah no very near that school
B	erm
A	cos we both lived there and it was it was known to be a good school as well
B	yeah
A	so I knew before I moved here cos I'd phoned up and they said they'd accept him and I knew that there was a good school
B	yeah yeah
A	and I knew that erm the and then when I moved here I didn't change in part because of that cos it was a good school
B	mm yeah
A	and cos it was
B	mm
A	erm he'd've had to go to the English schools here
B	yeah yeah
A	mm
B	mm
A	I just
B	but er it it I mean er I think nowadays erm it's very hard for
A	yeah
B	and and in England you can't do it
A	it's getting more competitive here actually as well
B	mm
A	erm that the to the Gaelic-speaking school there's a waiting list now I mean I should've
B	mm
A	had his name down when he was one or something and I haven't got his name down yet
A	erm there's
B	yeah
A	a really long waiting list for it it's no
B	right right
A	I think though some a couple of people not many but a couple of people have gone to like all-boys' schools after their primary that have been English-speaking
B	right
A	that are the erm the remnants of sort of the older days of of er the best Catholic schools
B	yes mm
A	and one of them is the one that I that you pay for even though it's not
B	yeah
A	actually
B	yeah
A	compared to ours I think it's one or two thousand euros a year which is
B	right mm
A	like about eight hundred quid a year
B	right right
A	and everything else subsidises
B	mm
A	that much
B	how does how does
A	yeah we haven't talked about it yet
B	head round it
A	I think er I think he'd like him to go to the the Irish-speaking school
B	mm
A	but erm that's one of the reasons why I got this assessment done it'd be quite good to
B	mm
A	talk to other people and see what they think actually
B	yeah
A	about somebody
B	mm
A	like him and how he'd be erm
B	yeah
A	kids
B	yeah
A	I think I think it's when they I think the universities offer really good science courses with erm the up to them
B	yeah
A	the schools aren't always that
B	but not many
A	mm
B	erm like
B	they do do some science in the UK
B	right
A	erm but erm I know it's not loads but they do
B	mm right
A	they they introduce them all like for a few years
B	yeah
A	and they give there's opportunities I think more opportunities more for people to do they they're bringing that in more and more actually in the UK and I think they're just realising that they need
B	they need scientists
A	yeah
B	erm but erm and
A	yeah
B	and erm
A	yeah
B	erm but certainly in the erm the secondary schools I mean it's erm
A	yeah
B	like er because erm I mean it's just my gut feeling is that the nearer a school is to where you live especially in the early years like he's gotta learn a whole new language
A	the trouble is as well
B	mm
A	there was an Irish school used to be round the corner when cos when
B	mm
B	mm
A	part of the reason probably here
B	mm
A	it's part of the reason
B	mm
A	there's quite a nice
B	mm
A	the school moved
B	oh no
A	and the school was actually it's quite a long way so it was really
B	really?
A	like sort of too long to walk actually
B	right right right
A	which is really annoying
B	but er but er
A	even though it says in
B	mm
B	but would it be easier to get to school in
A	possibly but then erm er then I think for at least a couple of years they only go half days
B	that's right that's right
A	it's quite you know it's
B	mm
A	a bit of a bind really
B	it's er it's it's a it's a very it's it it
A	yeah
B	mm
A	yeah it is getting a bit tricky yeah cos the actually where they put the school was right on the back road which you have to go right the way in I'd have to go right the way into town and then out again cos the back road's just
B	mm
A	down there
B	mm
A	I could
A	cos that was that would make it
B	mm
A	it's a still a long walk but walk but I can't do
B	and you you you can't you can't actually sort of keep pushing him to school when he's seven
A	no
B	er do do you know what I mean? that erm I mean he has to er
A	mm mm
B	walk you know?
A	also
B	mm
A	she's moving into town I'm sure that's part of it because she can just
B	mm
A	take the kids to
B	mm
A	even though she's nearer
B	right mm
A	cos so it's like she's about twenty minutes nearer than I am but erm
B	mm
A	yeah possibly for her now
B	that's right that's right mm yeah
A	erm
B	erm
A	yeah I'll have to have to think about those things
B	er but is but but I mean that's why as I say would it be easier for you to go to a school in
A	yeah
B	the the bus
A	mm
B	but then it takes you into
A	yeah
B	quite a bit place but er
A	yeah
B	mm
A	possibly but then I suppose that's it's
B	mm
A	he would the future that the
B	yeah yeah yeah erm
A	I mean they might be able to squeeze him in after a year or two but that
B	mm
A	that that would be it the cut off
B	yeah yeah
A	that's not really fair on the kid
B	yeah
A	after that
B	but how would you get him to the Irish school for instance?
A	I don't know
A	I mean cos
B	mm
A	even when
A	erm
B	but you'd have to bring him back
A	yeah
A	I know
B	and take him back you know?
A	and there's
B	erm
A	like you know
B	erm I mean this is very it's terribly complicated
A	yeah
B	and there aren't any easy answers
A	no
B	mm
A	I mean even if I like got on like with a house on fire with
A	probably do it it's not the kind of er
A	but you know even that option
B	mm
A	so I don't I don't know
B	but she's not living here anyway she's
A	well she'd be living in
B	oh she's
A	oh she's not living here so
B	oh oh she's not going and living in
A	no
B	I mean if she moves to
A	oh yes
B	is she going to is
A	yeah she's still living in
B	oh right right right
A	she's gonna move into the school
B	mm mm
A	the the Irish-speaking one in
B	mm mm right
A	but just into the village
B	right erm
A	which makes it a lot easier for the school
B	yeah erm
A	cos then it's the
B	right yeah
A	but at the minute it's not really walkable even for her
B	right right
A	because even though well we're just on the other side of the
B	yeah yeah
A	the village is quite long isn't it?
B	mm
A	it's a couple of miles
A	I suppose it relies on most mums have a car and a home and they I dunno even though
B	how do they and it's not a a the best of things
A	yeah
B	er but how how how do they erm
A	erm
B	whether you
A	antisocial?
B	you actually want to spend the next
A	yeah
B	five to eighteen okay however many years is that thirteen years
A	mm
B	being a teacher?
A	yeah
B	to one and it's not so good for the child because it means that you're not with your peer group
A	yeah
B	erm and erm
A	yeah it's a shame though shame this school's not round the corner and it's not
[ANNOTATION]	The kids are antisocial.	Neutral
B	mm
A	the good English-speaking school and then there would be no
A	problem if it was in the last you know
B	yeah yeah that's right
A	and actually it would be really nice and kind of
B	erm
[ANNOTATION]	There is not a good English speaking school.	Contradiction
A	taking him
B	mm
A	for that
B	yeah
A	walk
B	yeah
A	and everything
B	yeah
A	erm
B	erm erm
A	yeah but I
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	One has a dog.	Neutral
A	but it's probably the same here I wouldn't mind in a way but I'd then I'd I'd need to take him to other things and do the social part of him it is weird sometimes when I think
B	mm
A	is it worth it? he's going in having to learn another language probably having to go through numbers and things that he's
[ANNOTATION]	A kid has to learn a new language.	Entailment
B	mm
A	already done
B	mm mm well he'll have to learn the Irish for the numbers he won't be doing one two three
A	yeah that's right yeah
B	yeah
A	that's true isn't it? and everything will be read
B	and he'll only be two years older than he is now
[ANNOTATION]	This will take 2 years.	Entailment
A	yeah I know
B	yeah erm
A	that's what that after the assessment actually
B	mm
A	one of the women looked at me and said oh cos we
B	mm
A	talking about doing doing the test
B	mm
A	and
A	erm and looked at me and said oh yes you'll you'll be thinking of school won't you? I go yeah
A	oh yeah and that's what I've been doing now just
B	mm yeah but it's
A	not that god knows what it
B	but it is it's it's you know you're you're in a
A	yeah I know
B	erm
A	it's funny cos this house is really lovely and and
B	mm
A	dunno if he'd be able to move he probably wouldn't want to er
B	mm
B	well it's
A	the day to
B	the only other thing er
A	mm
B	no no you would have to go
A	oh me in
B	in the taxi with him
A	oh yeah
B	hang around at whichever neck of the woods at
A	see you could probably drop him off
B	mm
A	in the morning at some somewhere or other but erm
B	but not if he's got to be at the other end at nine o'clock school time
A	yeah
B	or are they all
A	see
B	near each other?
A	yeah they've
B	yeah
A	so he probably wouldn't be starting that early
B	mm
A	yeah so I'd need to go with him and hang around probably
B	that's right
B	that's right
A	that we would have to take priority really
B	I mean er would would no no
A	yeah sorry yeah
B	do do you know what I mean? that that
A	yeah
B	cos he is
A	yeah
B	right? it's not as if
A	yeah
B	it's just your child
A	yeah
B	you know?
A	yeah
B	so to get to get
A	yeah
B	erm he'd have to sort of say sorry
A	oh yeah I mean
B	yeah yeah and in two years' time
A	and her mum you know her mum's got a car and she actually goes in the same way
A	at least some of the days at some point
B	right yeah
A	and she's
A	old enough to have a
B	but it is I mean I know it's
B	you know
A	yeah
B	it
A	yeah
B	it is difficult because the only other solution as I say is if
A	yeah
B	do something else in the middle
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	mm
A	mm
B	especially if they are only half a day
A	yeah that's the thing they're only half a day
B	erm
A	yeah preschool's a bit like that as well preschool's only a year away
B	yeah
A	and it like he might need more adjust time to adjust than other kids
A	we've got so many other things and
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	but that's part of the thing er you know just saying the other
B	yeah and
A	yeah it's okay
B	although it is fairly loaded
A	yeah
B	but erm but how are you how do you feel about living
A	mm
B	are you erm is it okay just now? or is it do you see yourself here right through
A	as in this
B	in your that sort of
A	this area? or in
B	well with
A	with
B	really yes
A	yeah
B	you know erm
A	yeah
B	erm well you don't have to answer that question
A	yeah no I don't
B	mm
[ANNOTATION]	have no idea who that is	Contradiction
A	it's all fine I can you know I can see it all working out fine in the future
B	yeah yeah
A	there's
B	yeah
A	there are question marks about whether erm
A	ex-wife and kind of erm er
B	that's right
A	not quite so erm easy for other things and you know
B	yeah
A	and there will be and then
B	right right so
A	even though erm
B	yeah yeah
A	as well and that's that's that has got
[ANNOTATION]	It will work fine right now	Neutral
A	where
B	mm
A	erm I mean if ideally I suppose I'd love us all to be me and
B	yeah
A	you know
B	but I was
A	erm
B	erm
[ANNOTATION]	hate the way things are going	Contradiction
A	I don't know
B	then the other thing to put in your head is how do you think it would
A	yeah
B	you brought both
[ANNOTATION]	there will be others	Neutral
A	mm
B	at school time right?
A	yeah
B	erm or thereabouts and every holiday and half term you went home?
A	mm yeah
B	I mean would that be could you see that being workable for you and
A	yeah
B	or not? erm
A	yeah I don't know I think I think
B	mm
[ANNOTATION]	going home during holiday is a good idea	Entailment
A	he's not he's not flexible like that
B	yeah
A	and he's erm
B	and he'd be on his own for a good few weeks at a time
A	yeah he's not very good
B	mm
A	on his own erm
[ANNOTATION]	he is a very adapting to life	Contradiction
B	mm
A	but
B	mm erm
A	I suppose it's hard because it's er the difficulties with the way
B	yeah
A	and if I'm
B	mm
B	yeah
A	life
B	yeah yeah
A	and lots of things don't work for us because they're not how we'd set things up
B	yeah yeah
A	and some of that erm but then we've gained other things as well
B	yes of course of course
A	which is which is really
B	and you've got to
A	and one of them is
B	weigh up the pluses and the minuses
A	yeah
B	it was like when I went it was
A	yeah
B	erm with his
A	yeah
B	but the pluses outweighed the minuses
A	yeah
B	erm and erm er so on the whole that was better than having stayed in
A	yeah
B	on my own
A	yeah
B	which would have been much much worse because I wasn't I wouldn't
A	yeah and having a
B	mm
A	kind of having a a partner is you know really
B	oh
A	that's a really
B	oh and it stabilises you
A	but it's
B	erm mm
A	being able to live happily with a father of kids as well with
B	mm mm
B	that's right
A	those are also two big things
B	yeah mm
A	but then to completely if I just stay here and do nothing and without thinking about things without consciously
B	erm mm
A	deciding okay I'll
B	mm
B	mm
A	just try and do this and that
B	mm
A	then then it is me just erm
B	that's right he
A	and come back
B	yeah that's right
A	and he's quite happy with it
B	mm
A	and his mum is round the corner
B	mm
A	and his other kids are there so
B	that's right mm
A	it's okay for him
B	yeah
A	erm but it's not
B	yeah
A	I think she said a couple of times that she think it could have worked more if she was there with her people and her support even though
B	yeah
A	she's loathed to move now from
B	yeah she
A	likes it so much she loves the sea and everything
B	she's and obviously mum not moving back to
A	yeah even though
B	but er
A	I think if
B	yeah
A	even then she might not it might be too hard for her cos
B	mm mm
A	er er past a certain stage I think that sometimes it's hard
B	you can't do it you can't do it you're too
A	yeah
B	I mean I dreamed of going back to Scotland at one point
A	yeah
B	erm but now?
A	yeah
B	I mean now yes not now but I mean I just knew I couldn't
A	yeah
B	erm
A	and sometimes you can just adjust I mean
B	mm
A	sometimes I felt a bit like cos
B	that's right
A	tricky as well
B	mm
A	erm but this year because he's had this er a couple of friends and one of them lives down the road from here
B	yeah mm
A	sometimes
B	yeah yeah
A	we we do go in for his rugby so it's all the way there
B	mm
A	but then
B	mm
A	the
B	mm mm
A	gymnastics are here so erm he's getting more and more out of it but sometimes I think you know maybe for him it might be nice just to have things a bit
B	mm
A	easier for him during the day and is this er is this is this okay for him? is this a compromise too far for him and
B	yeah yeah
A	or even with the girls I think you now we put a lot a lot of effort in there over
B	mm
A	the years and even though we've had some nice times all together
B	yeah mm
A	I also think oh I invested quite a lot in people who don't actually really the I don't think there's any future there there's no there's
B	mm
A	maybe I'm wrong maybe maybe one of the girls will grow into an adult and get be erm start to bond with us or something
B	mm
A	but I think it's probably doubtful it will probably they'll be so
B	yeah
A	things I mean I respect erm as well as
B	yeah
A	necessarily going to be the people who will care about him
B	yeah
A	throughout his life
B	yeah yeah
A	so is erm
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	you know I know that that we've got to think about the whole family
B	yeah
A	too so I don't know I mean sometimes I feel or I've even contemplated
B	mm
A	but it's
B	yeah
A	a year is actually quite a short time as well
B	and er it er in a sense and this is where because it all started with sort of
A	yeah
B	you know? erm so in that sense that's why I kind of brought it up because
A	yeah
B	if it's going to be I mean there there are other ways of going round it is actually to sell up here
A	yeah
B	if you can and move to
A	yeah
B	which is a town
A	yeah
B	but would
A	yeah it
B	mm mm
A	but then sometimes he can
A	I can't always predict
B	right right right
A	he can be very very very kind of like
B	mm
A	hanging on hanging on and then he'll just
B	right right yes
A	but that doesn't happen very often
B	yeah yeah
A	erm
B	that's right
A	as soon as he moved to
B	now now now he won't
A	he'll never go back
B	he won't leave
A	I've even sometimes thought I wonder
A	erm because their mum's got a an English boyfriend
B	yeah
A	who's there I'm not sure
B	yeah
A	he'll be able to move for a long time because
B	mm
A	he's he's I dunno maybe he's he's got quite a few property investments they
B	yeah
A	in Croydon that's where he lives
B	yeah
B	alter it yes
A	very
B	yeah that's right
A	to move or anything but
B	mm
A	erm but he's sick of it enough to erm consider going back on consultancy again he said that in the last couple of weeks
B	yeah mm
A	which erm cos if he's weighing up having his
B	mm
A	might well
B	mm yeah
A	I think it's
B	you know it was just
A	er I think it's worth talking about
B	er erm yeah I'm not looking for
B	oh yes erm I would definitely do this
A	yeah
B	it's just how is how are you feeling? you know how erm because erm er I personally and this might be wrong
A	mm
B	I can't see you living in
A	yeah
B	erm
A	this is house is lovely
B	it would
A	isn't it this house really really nice
B	it's absolutely lovely
A	yeah
B	erm and erm the er I mean I now wish I still lived in
A	yeah
B	but but it was it was er and at the particular point when we sold it you know
A	mm
B	and we could have let out every room we had we still managed it but
A	yeah
B	erm cos of
A	yeah
B	there wasn't much left you know
A	yeah
B	erm but that was all within a small area
A	yeah
B	you know of a city
A	yeah
B	you know er erm that erm and I just vaguely sometimes think oh now wouldn't it be nice cos then I'd have a really big house where
A	yeah
B	but erm
A	yeah
B	erm
A	that is nice isn't it?
B	erm
A	yeah
B	but then I think no yeah actually this is a this is a better house for you
A	yeah
B	erm because erm er and it is
A	yeah
B	cos even when there's no one else there
A	yeah
B	it doesn't feel too big for us cos it's not too big all the rooms are quite small
A	yeah
B	erm they're not erm and it's not it's not a massively big place
A	yeah
B	but it does it it can cope with X Y and Z
A	yeah
B	erm and erm er I have vaguely and it's only very vaguely
A	yeah
B	cos I really don't think that
A	yeah
B	but
A	yeah
B	to live in
A	not now no it's really er
B	in
A	yeah
B	I couldn't afford the bills
A	oh really?
B	no
A	oh really?
B	er I would get about four and a half thousand a year
A	okay
B	erm which would just about cover the bills I think you know
A	yeah
B	erm so and I thought what would I do?
A	yeah
B	cos I don't actually want to sell up
A	yeah
B	erm I don't want to rent the whole thing out and rent a smaller place
A	yeah
B	and have a bit of money there erm it would er really I then I came up with sort of idea I thought mm one of my children could live
A	yeah
B	and pay the bills and I could go and live with another child and I would have two two rooms one in in
B	and one
A	yeah
B	in
A	yeah
B	erm would have to put up with other people visiting
B	you now but er do you know what I mean? but er
A	yeah
B	er
A	yeah
B	I thought it made me quite happy I thought yes I will be able to manage
A	yeah
B	by not letting out to strangers
A	yeah
B	erm
A	yeah you don't wanna let out to strangers do you really?
B	I don't actually I really don't want to let out
A	no
B	to
A	yeah
B	erm erm but I thought erm er this is not because I think
A	no
B	don't don't get my wrong
A	oh no
B	you know?
A	oh yeah I think
B	erm
A	gonna be
B	mm
A	hanging on there for a while yet
B	but
A	but it's worthwhile thinking through some of these things like taking your time rather than have it suddenly like oh my god
B	mm
A	what do I do?
B	erm and also we'll have plenty of time for me to get my head round all the things I just like erm
A	yeah
B	erm in the house you know
A	yeah
B	er cos I remind myself that actually there are places many many years ago
A	yeah
B	erm
A	cos he wants to turn it into the a B and B again when
A	it's it's
B	and I don't want to
A	it's hilarious isn't it?
A	it er it doesn't suit you it would sit him possibly but
B	oh yes yes yes er but you see
A	but even then it would like drive him potty really I think
B	but he wouldn't he wouldn't need the money
A	yeah
B	you see? cos
A	yeah
B	erm if I died first
A	yeah
B	erm
A	oh okay
B	because at a certain point when we could have taken erm
A	yeah
B	erm from money invested like a you know a pension erm on my name
A	yeah
B	er but we'd have got much less
A	yeah
B	than if it was in
A	yeah
B	and that's most of our income now
A	yeah
B	because all his other pensions like for the church from I think he gets one from the church you know
A	oh right
B	erm
B	and his old age pension is much bigger
A	yeah
B	and mine is much smaller erm the erm but he he would be fine
A	yeah
B	he wouldn't have to let it out at all he would do it because maybe he was he wanted somebody in the house
A	yeah
B	erm but erm no I I couldn't live in in
A	yeah
B	but then I thought how would you do it
A	yeah
B	and I thought that's the perfect solution I've always want er I've always er want er
A	yeah
B	so you know doesn't matter which child it is
A	yeah
B	erm er but I wouldn't want to live permanently with
A	yeah
B	people like that you know
A	yeah
B	er but then I would try and get away erm in somebody else's house
A	yeah
B	family house and just
A	yeah
B	er and I thought that would be really quite good
A	well you're always welcome to you could come and live here there's loads of room
B	yeah but but but
B	and and and yes come come come for a few months to yours or
A	yeah
B	whatevers but erm
A	yeah
B	erm but erm er but I would I would erm but again if I was living here
A	yeah
B	I would not want to be like
A	yeah
B	so I would be I would want my room my television
A	yeah
B	you know? erm that kind of thing
A	yeah
B	and just be able to sort of potter around myself you know
A	oh yeah
B	erm and
B	then do do do the
A	no you can't be a guest in somebody's house it's a horrible way to live
B	you know it's er it's it's
A	yeah
B	actually
A	yeah
B	erm but it I I really felt we were happy then
A	oh that's good that you
B	cos I thought
A	like there is
B	mm
A	there were options that would suit you
B	not happy that
B	I would I would
A	yeah
B	but you know there would be no fear that er and he wouldn't die suddenly
A	mm
B	so we I could get my head round all the money business and the bills
A	yeah
B	stay here
A	yeah
B	actually without doing anything
A	yeah
B	but then after that year I would have to do something
A	yeah
B	erm
A	yeah
B	er and then I wouldn't be too much of a burden on anybody
A	yeah
B	on any one person erm
A	yeah that's
B	but erm
A	yeah that's true
B	er it I would still feel I was independent
A	yeah
B	but it would just be that
A	yeah
B	you don't want to kind of that's granny's room you know
A	yeah
B	that's granny's telly that can record
A	yeah
B	you know kind of style erm
A	no you're right is
B	mm
A	actually I've been er feel like I should think about my pension but as well recently I was thinking this is the kind of time that I could do something about it but erm
B	yeah
A	cos I don't have I I don't really
B	you won't have a lot actually
A	I won't have a lot
B	erm
A	and er the way that things stand at the minute erm I don't
B	erm
A	I have like a small very small like NHS one because I
B	right
A	I left I mean I was only there
B	mm
A	eight years
B	mm
A	even though it was a good one at the time and then since then I've only worked part-time
B	mm
A	and I've I've always
B	mm
A	put into a pension pot but how something like that and then erm so that's what I have and if if I'm here living with
B	mm right
A	erm that's sorted out a lot of the finances she has got claim to all of his pensions
B	yeah yeah
A	erm and erm
B	mm mm mm
A	cos you said you couldn't afford it and it hasn't actually got the money I think his solicitor said you'd need to pay her twenty thousand to for her to sign away your pension
B	really?
A	cos he's already done all the finance because
B	right
A	and he hasn't got twenty thousand
B	mm mm
B	yeah
A	leave it another five ten years she might not wanna do that cos she might be thinking more about her future
B	absolutely absolutely
A	and erm might be wanting those and so
B	mm
A	so I'm quite precarious but and also this house has nothing to do with me
B	okay
A	it's not in my name
B	no no
A	it's all been left to the girls
B	no right
A	erm so erm if he dies I've got no pensions and no home
B	yes yeah yeah
A	and I think he he's he's got so many financial responsibilities that he just hasn't even been able to think or talk about it
B	no no
A	he he kind of tried a bit but he really
B	no mm
A	he got angry at first and then just erm
B	mm
A	erm said oh you know I'm happy to share my pension with you and that er it and but he still hasn't divorced
B	yeah
A	so there are some things not just the schooling I think that if I don't sort out no matter now like
B	mm mm mm
A	but there are too many other people erm who are at the minute still have a stake and claim to him that he's he's allowing himself to be
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	and that kind of thing and so er I'm vulnerable in that way if if
B	yeah
A	if
B	yeah
A	if the ex or any of the kids want
B	mm
A	more money and I mean I'm not sure
B	yeah
A	how much he's paying I mean that I think he's
B	yeah
A	I think he's not had to pay so much for erm the university for
B	right
A	because she's living at her mum's so he's tried to
B	yeah
A	well not wangle but just er
B	mm yeah
A	apparently they only go in that the parent they're
B	right
A	for some of it
B	yeah
A	but she'll still need living expenses and I can imagine that
B	mm
A	so there there are things
B	mm
A	going on cos I don't have access to the main bank account that's his
B	yeah right yeah
A	so I'm quite I'm
B	mm
A	in a vulnerable position
B	you are in quite a vulnerable position that's right
A	and if erm erm
B	mm
A	there was there's also I'm also thinking about what what do I need to do about my future? and he said he said oh you know you'll have your house and that income I said well our house is not necessarily my pension because then where I might not I I've got no other stable home
B	yeah yeah that's right
A	so that is that is really my home
B	that's right
A	erm that's not an additional part of money for me
B	mm mm
A	and also I want to leave something to my kids which include
B	that's it mm
A	and erm I don't you know I you you want to you know
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A want to spend all the money he/she owns.	Contradiction
A	your house and your
B	mm
A	your girls will be getting possibly two homes
B	yeah
A	from their mother
B	yeah
A	and their father two
B	yeah
A	like five bedroomed
B	yeah
A	homes erm and erm I want to leave something to that that
B	mm
A	I've built up over the years
[ANNOTATION]	The girls will inherit houses.	Entailment
B	yeah yeah
A	and because I'm I'm here and I am
B	mm
A	our son
B	yeah
A	with when I was working I paid money
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	into the house and that kind of thing so there are there are things we
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A only has daughters.	Contradiction
B	mm
A	and I understand all sorts of reason why er er
B	yeah
A	in the past but
B	yeah
A	I'm just gonna kind of get the crumbs if I'm not careful of everything
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A has muscle contraction issues.	Entailment
B	yeah
A	of where we are wherever
B	yeah yeah right
A	if they move to where all the
B	mm
A	he and
B	yeah
A	she her name was on the bank account her name was on the mortgage
B	mm
A	the school was down the road
B	mm that's right
[ANNOTATION]	The school was far away.	Contradiction
A	the family were around
B	yeah yeah
A	all those kinds of things and I suddenly have got I'm not near the schools with er I'm not near where I'd like you know
B	mm
A	I because I don't drive in England
[ANNOTATION]	In England people drive on the right side of the road.	Neutral
B	you're near your family
A	not near my family I'm not you know I'm I'm in the the house that I've only just started to claw back some
B	uhu
B	yeah yeah
A	because you know when the girls were here at first it was
B	yes
A	er they didn't really
A	make me feel at yeah they didn't make me feel at home
B	mm mm
A	so there's lots of erm battles and also erm even with you know my house if I I dunno if I want to
B	mm
A	erm if I need to do anything with it then I'm or I want to sell it even to like get another house say like if I
B	mm
A	say got one in
B	no
A	somewhere where I could erm that is more of a more so I could keep and eye on it really or even I just erm wanted to reinvest some money somewhere else
B	or even if you put that into a pension fund
A	or if I put it into a pension fund or a left it as that but it's the
B	there's there's all sorts of
A	yeah
B	ins and outs that er
A	but I've got to think of that kind of thing
B	mm
A	but but if erm er
B	mm
A	liable in both countries for that as well
B	right right
A	and Ireland's quite harsh on that in
B	right yeah
A	harsher than the UK
B	right
A	erm so I'm I'm not sorting out my investments so I like
B	but it's but it's I mean and again because you had
A	mm
B	er first of all I just
A	yeah
B	for them thinking properly right?
A	yeah
B	erm that er cos you don't have a brain
A	yeah
B	erm your brain's not in in in right working order
A	yeah
B	I mean erm never mind all the other problems that you had as well
A	yeah
B	and now that he's now on his birthday his third birthday
A	yeah
B	is this schooling bit that's sort of cropped up
A	mm
B	which is going to add another pressure to your life
A	yeah
B	erm and makes it actually much more difficult to say right I'll go out to work when he's at school because
A	yeah
B	you can't do you know you
A	I know
B	it's not that kind of erm the the the hours the erm erm you don't have someone near who would actually be willing to sort of erm help with like
A	yeah
B	the childcare or anything like this
A	yeah
B	that er erm er so in a sense him going to school will be
A	yeah
B	and this I'm I can be quite sort of sure of this will be another transition bit
A	mm
B	of both and
A	mm
B	you know erm the I've got no solutions
A	yeah
B	you know
A	but it's worthwhile I think thinking of
B	mm
A	things long term I think if you think
B	oh yes yes
A	think for example
B	think of things in the long term
A	like you go like I suppose the options in one way are clear like I stay with
B	mm
A	and that's erm that's the next like
B	mm
A	hopefully forty years whatever
A	does feel like a long time don't stay with him and there's there's other connotations but there erm er
B	or you moved you stay with
A	so if I stay with
B	which is near enough his kids
A	oh god yeah
B	and
A	yeah
B	erm erm the the you know it's
A	yeah
B	near his work it's
A	but also lots of things are
B	yeah
A	are also in transition too there were
B	but for him to come over to England
A	because kids are in transition
B	is erm
A	yeah
B	I can't imagine I cannot imagine
A	no
B	I don't know why but I just can't you know
A	yeah I think a lot of
B	yes yeah yeah
A	also we it's it is tricky though erm with him because I think he's got frustrations wherever he is and I think he's got frustrations
B	mm
A	here because he hasn't done huge things with his life and
B	right
A	I mean he's
B	yes
A	they are huge things I'm not saying
B	and they are
A	you know
B	erm but erm
A	but he's got a kind of there is a bit of a yearning in him but there to flourish I think
B	right
A	but but
B	mm
A	erm I don't know if he's able to do what it needs to flourish cos er to flourish you've got to take risks and and
B	yeah
A	you have to change and you have to be
B	yeah
A	out there and you have to I think when he left his wife that was a huge thing for him
B	yeah
A	and
B	mm
A	he did flourish for a while erm
B	right
A	and whether er at work somebody erm said to him a couple of months ago he said oh yeah he has great potential
B	mm mm
A	and he and he said that to me he said I know he I think he knows there's he erm
B	oh really?
A	when he met
B	oh right
A	and he quite liked it
B	right
A	I think he quite liked
B	mm
A	and he moved in with a friend
B	yeah
A	erm and then he
B	mm
A	no no other
B	mm
A	friends just the family nothing
B	mm
A	they went for their
B	mm
A	own holidays they worked in
B	mm
A	the same job and
B	yeah
A	but so I don't it's
B	yeah
A	erm so who knows
A	erm
B	is he of the ilk potentially
A	mm
B	to just say right
A	yeah
B	erm get a caravan and just go
A	no see if I I think
B	mm
A	the thing is he doesn't really erm
B	he's not that kind of person
A	I think he's frustrated but he's
B	right right
A	but it's more than he's got now
B	right
A	and I think sometimes when he's really felt like he doesn't always where he's got out there and when he's
B	mm
A	out there somewhere else
B	yeah
A	so it's to do with I think being out somewhere else doing stuff but he can't like I've
B	mm
A	for yourself
B	yeah
A	or you've got to start doing things that
B	yeah
A	make you feel cos he'll say oh no just kind of on the treadmill and when I'm here I'm doing the housework
B	mm
A	but I think cos part of him
B	yeah
A	kind of you now oh I don't know what the world word is I don't mean
B	mm
A	I don't mean to denigrate him but that
B	mm
A	kind of
B	we'll have to see the autistic
A	no it's not no
A	it's not I don't think it's a denigrating word
B	but but he'd be the one with the
A	yeah
B	I I think of of him as being the
A	yeah
B	sort of erm erm the one who's
A	yeah
B	the rest of fine but but he was erm erm
A	I think to sort of erm to get going he'd erm it's more we go away like every couple of months and a weekend but oh no and there's and money's hard and I can't really do it because I'm
B	yeah
A	just do it
B	right right yes yes
B	yeah
A	something like that but erm
B	mm
A	so it's that
B	mm
A	maybe she won't I don't know erm
B	no no
A	I think
B	no it's
A	other other yeah I don't
B	mm
A	I definitely don't think he'll make any decision future decisions to do something that will make erm in his life or look in that er ahead enough in the future to think right
A	mm
B	if that happens then I'll go off and then I'll
B	mm
A	or
B	mm mm
A	then I'll have this great adventure
B	mm mm
A	he just won't do it
B	yeah
A	but erm he's
B	yeah mm
A	got together to leave erm and after feeling very shy for a while and not going out he just suddenly started going he was kind of
B	yeah yeah
A	because he had to do
B	mm
A	he just
B	yeah
A	had to do something and er and that and that's a a time he talks to
B	right right
A	in a way once he's if he's forced to do like say if he was forced to move to
B	yes
A	will never make that decision to do it
A	well
B	yeah
A	I'm leaving you unless we go to
B	gone
A	me to be in
A	me for him to move in with me
A	so
B	that's the thing erm erm
A	so I don't
B	yeah I mean
A	I've just got to go to the
B	erm
A	gonna have another coffee actually
B	what did you say it's for you not
