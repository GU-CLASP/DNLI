E	no no but when he first started I thought well isn't it a bit dangerous not having shoes on?
D	yeah
E	you know children they swing on their chairs and then the chair goes on their foot and then if they're using scissors and things like that but obviously there must have covered all
D	all the bases yeah

D	we've double whammied
B	oh do you want it?
C	Billy
E	it's certainly a little bit harder than when you first kind of say oh I've got the perfect job you just tape people and you know and we get paid and you know but it just seeing you kind of like having to hold it out and remember to do it and I'd be like just gabbling on and thinking oh god I haven't even switched it on
B	we were wishing erm
B	we've got our American friends coming out and we natter with them for hours and hour and hours and if only they were er
C	busy road
E	a bit closer
B	British then we could record them

B	football ground
C	yeah Brighton and Hove Albion

D	happening
B	I think the entrance is down here
D	do you have to meet
B	think it's down here
D	so it's not just the actual events taking the time
E	well
C	it's lot of preparation
B	well that's quite a big
C	we offer that as part of the service yeah we sort of say what's your first dance song?
D	yeah
C	sometimes we'll already play it if not we'll try and learn it
D	yeah try and learn it
C	unless it's something really obscure and too difficult
B	do they do that?
C	sometimes they can yeah most of the time we we come up and
B	no one's requested a tool song then?
C	no nothing like that
B	no
C	or Pink Floyd or something
B	Pink Floyd even
D	have a ten minute opener

E	yeah you oh my god you were beating yourself up big time
B	what happened?
C	oh I forgot I forgot the chords
D	and it was their song like the
C	I just knew it just knew it so well and I got complacent and then when I first starting playing the chords I just I just completely forgot the chorus
B	crap
C	cos if he's playing like an F sharp or something
B	yeah you just go
C	I just play an F sharp
B	what happened?
C	oh we sort of muddled through but it it must have sounded appalling

C	no they didn't no
B	that's alright
E	but it's getting to the point now
B	do you wanna hold this and I'll play with

D	it's not something we find particularly hard I think we're okay
D	yeah I know keep the money going
E	yeah
D	that they've had so much contact but no contact with the other partner
E	yeah
D	they've they've heard of them so much but
E	yeah
D	but my parents haven't seen
E	no I know
D	they're definitely er
E	does it do you feel kind of like a bit nervous then now kind of like
D	yeah yeah I mean today it was like ah the in-laws are coming keep it clean whereas when it's my parents I cleaned for them just as much but I today that's like I couldn't er
D	no I do
E	I want you to
D	definitely as soon as you're as soon as people arrive it's like ah
E	yeah
D	yeah that's
E	it's like what's that all about?
D	she told me the exact same thing she said I really cleaned the house before you came and I was like really?
E	and it's like why? he's not even gonna notice
D	it's funny you did that as well I'll tell her that that'll please her
E	I think it's probably kind of like I don't know
D	yeah
E	before
D	another way of burning off the
E	and I was almost fearful of getting a call or a message to say we're not actually going to come now
D	yeah something's gone wrong
E	really really sorry
D	I know I think my mum was thinking that too up until the point we finally arrived
E	cos I was excited and then a few weeks beforehand I went into this kind of like
D	yeah
E	I don't know what that was and then as I was starting to go to the airport then the churning and the excitement
D	ah
D	I know it has been another two years
E	yeah
D	ah
E	well you're not twenty-eight yet are you?
D	not quite no I'm always going to have that on
E	it's a lot warmer now than I thought it was going to be
D	I know soon as it is
E	yeah it's lovely
D	yeah
E	it's when it dips down now it goes a bit cold doesn't it?
D	cold yeah
E	you know your way?
D	yeah I can remember I think
E	don't speed up I can't keep up
D	oh right sorry
D	I'm always teasing her
E	yeah
D	and he walked me everywhere around town and stuff so I think it came from keeping up with him
E	well that suits you and
D	yeah yeah exactly
E	go marching ahead
D	we find it difficult when we go out it's fine with family and stuff but yeah
E	yeah
D	if we're travelling with friends and things they've got to start walking or up their pace a little bit
D	yeah three brothers all older
E	so you were the much wanted daughter
D	daughter yeah really
E	ah
D	my mum er
E	did she not know before the birth then?
D	no no no yeah she never knew
E	shocked
D	quite upset that because er all of my brothers have stayed in Kent in
E	yeah
D	but er it's the daughter that actually disappeared so that kind of upsets them sometimes but
E	I was gonna say I'm sure they know that you're living your life
E	and enjoying it
D	and er
D	to live their life as well
E	live their dream and as well
D	yeah
E	and it's kind of like
D	yeah not to keep them
E	sit and watch them sail away or something like that
D	ah yeah
E	but isn't it supposed to be that girls stay stay closer to home?
D	stay closer to family yeah they're meant to be better
E	yeah but maybe you kind of like you know
D	maybe eventually
E	were you a tomboy at all when you were young?
D	I was yeah I was quite badly as a as a small child
E	in what way?
D	I didn't my mum would have to fight me into a dress I never wore a dress I've got a really distinct memory of hiding underneath the living room coffee table I think I was about four or five and I obviously thought nobody could see me but everyone could but it's because they my mum made me put this dress on before my grandparents came to visit and I was like no I think I went through a small stage of being determined to stand up when I went for a wee and things like that it was really really into just a tomboy
D	just surrounded by boys growing up
E	I was tomboy in a sense that I'd climb and yeah walk on walls and
D	yeah
E	and I'd fall into rivers and I'd
E	and I'd fall into rose bushes and anything I could do
E	but er
D	yeah
E	cos she was louder than me
D	louder more dominant older sibling
E	yeah
D	no I mean she well he's just told me that you know
D	described her now rather than when he was younger
E	I wonder how
D	yeah I'd like to meet her of course
E	oh she'd love you
D	and the whole family
E	yeah definitely I don't know what
D	erm all of the children er
E	I don't know how you're going to manage it or what what your thoughts are on all of you coming up or
D	I know
D	I know I mean
E	yeah
D	not necessarily on the actual Christmas day when we're going to be with our immediate families
E	yeah
D	but during the Christmas period
E	yeah
D	it would be nice to get in some visits but
E	okay
D	have to talk to
E	yeah it would be nice
D	but I think it's possible
D	yeah
E	your proposal and you know
D	cousins I know I do want to meet his cousins
E	and you'll kind of like get more of a background of him I guess
D	yeah next generation
E	yeah
D	er who is it that has the son and the daughter?
E	yeah
E	yeah
D	yeah yeah yeah
E	yeah she's the eldest but I think
D	okay that's who came to visit us I think then
E	yeah
D	yeah
E	yeah she did that's right
D	oh right yeah
E	yeah
D	ah that's it yeah
E	yeah
D	are they doing okay with younger parents
E	yeah they seem to be doing really good yeah
D	yeah
E	I mean it was all kind of like a bit of a oh my goodness
D	surprise
E	he's so young and
D	yeah
E	erm but no they're renting but they're not in erm
D	oh really?
E	yeah
D	wow
E	and he's got a job and
D	oh well that's kind of what you need is that my rubbish?
E	and he's learnt to drive yeah
D	sorry
E	and he's got a car so
D	oh well that's fine then isn't it?
E	seems to be doing okay
D	this whole ideal of how to be a great parent but it doesn't mean you have to subscribe to it
E	oh gosh keep on learning
E	it's a bit weird
D	bit strange isn't it?
E	oh I bet it was
D	and then the carpet was already like this
E	ah
D	oh god yeah
E	what's the flat gonna be like?
D	but I suppose
E	well I think it's really nice
D	oh yeah I
E	it's got a really nice feel to it
D	mm I think so
E	not got used to
D	yeah so
E	double locks
D	ah no
E	you alright?
D	this didn't er
E	do you want me to have a go?
D	should have
D	so we're getting cameras
E	yeah
D	and then there's
D	yeah
E	where's my camera then?
D	find out you didn't bring it with
D	you down from Bedford
E	no considering they're around the corner not really
D	oh no
E	just kind of like busy with their lives
D	yeah I suppose when when you work and you've got children or even if you don't
E	yeah
D	if you work full time that kind of takes up
E	I know and then it's like it
E	you know when you're free they're not free and it just oh I was gonna
E	erm
D	no
D	oh no the water pressure's ridiculous
D	and they were still taking care of you know still babysitting his child from time to time but it would always be the mother that brought brought him round
E	I think
D	depends on the children too
E	I think with
D	yeah yeah
E	force visits yeah
D	make time
E	we're coming down whether you like it or not
D	yeah
E	I don't want to be overbearing but
D	no
E	do you?
D	I am
E	ah try to
D	I guess
E	do you like that?
D	but then so do I yeah I don't mind it like I don't I quite my dad's
E	does he find it quite weird?
D	yeah he just doesn't understand
D	but yeah I guess it's a girl boy thing
E	yeah I mean most men don't particularly like phones or you know that kind of chit chat
D	chit chat yeah
E	yeah yeah
D	whereas we're happy to just talk
E	it's like well how can you talk about the weather and what you've had to eat?
D	to eat
D	ah I might just leave that on
E	have you done it?
E	did you when you went back home before coming here did you kind of get into a few TV programmes or was it catching up with your friends? and
D	oh I was just catching up
E	yeah
D	and er with friends and family
E	yeah
D	yeah it was nice
E	oh that's good
D	poor things
D	and then and then move
E	oh that's nice
D	just one just happened to be coming back through Brighton after a job interview in Chichester
E	mm
D	so it's already paying off being around
E	yeah
D	friends and family so
E	did it kind of feel like you'd just saw them last week
D	yeah
E	as opposed to I haven't seen them for a few years?
D	yeah it's does it
E	are these the ones that put the photos of you with them when they went travelling or something? I saw something on Facebook yeah
D	oh yeah someone did do that recently who did that?
E	I think that was a little while ago now I saw it but
D	maybe
E	they took a picture with you with them to wherever they went
D	oh that was oh maybe it was
D	it's because I did something similar with a photo that they gave me before we went to South America
E	oh okay
D	of the four of us it's a terrible photo as well we're all terribly drunk in it I've got it up on the kitchen door and I kept taking pictures of them places
E	yeah
D	it doesn't matter
E	it's nice to have that connection did
E	that's such a shame
D	he finally contacted
E	been able to get hold of him once he got home
D	no
E	ah that's a shame
D	cos we would of perhaps tried to plan something in this three week period of seeing him
E	yeah
D	although may have been too busy
E	what's happening in his life do you know? with with
D	he's er
E	oh okay
D	and he erm
E	cos the last I heard he was living in his mum's old place or something
D	mum's oh yeah I don't know why they decided to I guess they just got fed up of
E	yeah yeah
D	it attracts them
E	yeah
D	back again
E	they're kind of like home kind of feeling
D	feeling
E	do you feel when you got to Kent that you're going home?
D	er
E	co you're travelled and you've
D	yeah some
E	lived in Bath and
D	sometimes I don't
E	for a long time
D	I don't yeah I mean I certainly feel a connection to it
E	mm
D	and
E	yeah
D	and things like that
E	yeah
D	and like I can you know some of the streets around my parents' house I might bump into a neighbour or something like that
E	yeah
D	that I know so
E	no
D	yeah basically
E	it's true what they say home is where the heart is so
D	yeah that's definitely true
E	yeah
D	we will make a home from it
E	yeah
D	we've slept in some different places yeah yeah
E	got my sunglasses now the sun's gonna going
D	I know
E	so do you have a brother that's living at home with your mum and dad?
D	yeah I have I have one that's at er moved back home because him and his partner who have the little boy that's on the
E	yeah
D	kitchen window the shaved head they
E	okay
D	so yeah he moved back home
E	oh
D	but it's like well a few hundred pounds you know
E	yeah
D	just buying rounds of drinks for his mates and stuff like that
E	oh dear
D	and he you know he does do things with
E	is he still kind of in like a single guy's kind of mode?
D	guy's yeah absolutely and his er
E	she's dong the same thing
D	so
E	at the time
D	I mean he's fine but he has
E	yeah
D	which is quite a lot
E	yeah
D	so he considers my parents house completely his house as well
E	yeah
D	so at least he's had that sense of security
E	yeah
D	yeah
E	erm
D	support yeah
E	and and help
D	busy yeah
E	and maybe gone through that stage like my sister's now got erm grandchildren herself
[ANNOTATION]	The person being discussed has felt secure.	Entailment
D	herself yeah
E	so she's busy with erm work and
D	concentrating yeah
E	and then looking after the grandchildren and seeing her own children so
D	oh yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Someone being discussed is having trouble with their grandchildren.	Neutral
E	erm which is
D	yeah
E	you may have done
D	October maybe that one time I was down
E	she's she's kind of like yeah I mean if there's ever a family do or anything she'd be there
D	she'd be there yeah
E	yeah
D	ah is she the one who wants? yeah
E	and everything else yeah yeah
D	ah that's nice yeah
[ANNOTATION]	The person being discussed usually goes to family get-togethers.	Entailment
E	with the gigs and everything she's been such a help
D	oh wow yeah
E	and you know while
D	you were talking I know
[ANNOTATION]	One of the speakers has received assistance from someone.	Entailment
E	do you know it was kind of like I lost it completely there
D	it's cos yeah I think you jumped from I think and then probably thinking about
E	we were talking about your mum oh yeah about
D	erm about having grandparents around yeah
E	yeah that's it yeah and you saying about your mum and dad being a support I hate that is it an age thing or what?
D	yeah I know I don't know I do it as well it worries me a bit hoping it's not an age thing it's just thinking about lots of things at once
E	yeah I think you're right
D	erm yeah so
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker D lives with their grandparents.	Neutral
E	yeah
D	whatever the situation is
D	right yeah initially
E	and all of that and I think erm
D	can you see them?
E	we're bound to see him
D	oh yeah I see him up on the hill kicking the ball around
D	come back with a broken rib or something it's like
D	that bottle of wine
E	I'm gonna come up one night and stay on my own if you'll have me
D	yeah
E	and then we can have a few glasses of wine
D	I said oh maybe I should get my mum up come up too and he was like no please don't I can't manage three of you
E	not two parents
D	yeah definitely especially once the wine starts going
D	yeah
D	I know it will come round quickly really quickly
E	good
D	and making time for it

E	no
B	fleeting transit transient moment
E	I know I was saying to
D	yeah
C	is it a year?
B	yeah
E	yeah
B	it's a solid year but it's a year
E	so your lease is up as of August is it?
B	well actually we only have a six month lease
D	well
E	even though you had to pay eight months was it?
B	yeah
D	yeah it's still only a six month lease
B	still only a six month lease
D	okay
E	oh let's hope that that's not you know you'll just keep you going until you wanna finish
B	oh I'm sure they will
E	after that can you just sign for a month or two?
D	we can but I think you have to pay agency fees
B	erm
E	ah I think you should
B	but but if we do six months and say in August we could move back with you guys
E	careful wait
E	true yeah
B	we're tempted to just go to a monthly contract after the six months
E	how much do you have to pay extra to to do that?
B	well the monthly
E	oh okay so it's worth it then
B	and if we did a monthly contract it's fifteen pounds a month
E	yeah
B	so five months will cost us
E	you might as well do that then
B	but you potentially save a month in
D	depends what
E	yeah
D	in terms of work and university and dissertations
B	yeah what's going on
D	yeah our certificate
B	although it's a year we we don't actually get our grades back until the end of September beginning of October and then we don't get our qualification until December so don't know if they're gonna hire us
E	you might have to just get an interim job or something
B	we'll have to find out
[ANNOTATION]	It is definitely sure that they will get a job.	Contradiction
D	perhaps
E	if you can do that
B	I mean we can still get jobs that don't require an MA
E	oh don't think that far ahead yet anyway
B	kind of have to mum
D	it's
E	I know
B	if you want to keep living
D	you have to be prepared
[ANNOTATION]	B thinks that they'll get their qualifications at the end of the year.	Entailment
E	I know
B	see we realised the other day that we how many is it?
D	oh yeah
B	and now here this is the eighth place we've lived together
E	are you not tired yet of kind of like packing up and?
B	well since I met
E	so it would almost be foreign to kind of like stay longer then?
B	I mean a part of us is like come on
D	yeah
B	this is this is nice here maybe we should stay another year or something like that
E	yeah
B	I can't see us staying more than a year somewhere for a few years we'll do a year here a year in Saudi a year in Africa another year somewhere else
[ANNOTATION]	Their favourite time was staying for six months in Alabama.	Neutral
E	I wonder then whether you'll get to the point where okay enough's enough now
D	yeah we said that will we get to the point where
[ANNOTATION]	B prefered the second place where they lived together, but this one is not bad either.	Neutral
B	it does get a bit stressful
D	we need to settle down but
B	it does get a bit stressful doesn't it? packing up and moving
D	mm
E	would you
B	not only moving job but moving country and moving
E	yeah
D	yeah maybe
B	I mean we obviously like change
D	we like changing things
E	I was going to say would you miss it if you didn't have that er plan and look ahead and
[ANNOTATION]	B has moved many times and like change in general.	Entailment
B	I think it would be nice to go
D	perhaps yeah
B	perhaps to two year spots maybe spend two years somewhere and eventually five years somewhere but I imagine we'll move every five years for the rest of our lives
D	kind of erm
E	who knows eh?
[ANNOTATION]	E prefers planning but he's not opposed to this lifestyle.	Neutral
D	who knows? yeah
B	I might still die at thirty-four I thought I was going
E	oh god
B	exactly
E	yeah well I just don't like to think about
D	no
B	where is
D	he's there
B	oh he's on the swing shall I get him in it?
E	if you want to yeah
B	no he's he's with people now
D	jump in it
D	there you go perfect
B	yeah
D	that's how I'd approach it
B	oh he's made some friends
D	yeah
E	he doesn't erm he stands up for himself doesn't he?
B	good
E	he doesn't
B	yeah of course
E	he's caring and thoughtful and that but
D	yeah
E	oh gosh that seems a bit fast
D	yeah I know especially with her attached to it she doesn't seem worried does she?
B	no
E	she's done it before hasn't she?
D	yeah
B	they're little monkeys these things aren't they?
D	yeah they are they're fearless until they hurt themselves
E	yeah
B	that's what happens when you're small
E	I can remember
B	this is boring
E	I was mad on this when I was little
B	it's cos when you're a kid everything's fun isn't it? and then once you've done everything to death you're just like oh I'm bored of this now I've done this a bazillion times
D	yes
E	it's age though
D	something switches in the brain
E	it's really weird how that happens
D	ah
B	but to a certain degree it doesn't happen because even when you're old if you get into something new you take it on just like you did when you were a child you could get into karate or something and really go for it
E	I guess so yeah
B	so
C	new found love of golf
B	yeah
B	so you can still get into things and be passionate about things I think it's just that you've done loads of those things originally
E	yeah maybe
B	don't know if it's just an age thing
D	ah it's I mean age plays definitely a part
B	it's definitely age
D	that's the enthusiasm in a child something else
B	part of it as well as cos you've done it to death
E	I'm not sure that I'd enjoy playing with dolls and dressing them and all of that now
B	that's cos you that's cos you've done it
B	been there done that you've done it to death
E	think I was a perv or something
D	you won't have time
B	yeah but if you think about dolls
D	enough experience of real children
E	exactly
B	you've done that but with real children why would you go back to dolls? you've taken a step up
E	they don't answer you back
D	yeah
E	no
B	does seem easier doesn't it?
B	I've told you about our plan to adopt haven't it?
E	no
B	yeah thought I said if we were to ever to have a child we would adopt and we'd probably adopt a child just before their eighteenth birthday
E	oh
B	pay for them to go to university
D	and then they can look after us in our old age
B	and then and then they can look after us when we're old
C	good plan
B	I thought so
D	no yeah
B	we'll adopt an eighteen-year-old
E	it's really hard to tell
D	it's one of
E	don't you find it's really hard to tell sometimes when he's joking?
D	oh yeah yeah
D	is he winding me up?
E	yeah
B	me?
D	it's
E	yeah
D	yeah
B	oh could you not tell?
E	no
D	you become famous of it at uni to the point that when he told people interesting crazy facts that were true
B	people didn't believe me
D	they would believe him and later would be like ah
B	could you not tell
C	I could tell I could tell
D	er
E	I have to
E	he's just
B	I didn't say anything horrible did I? I can't remember what I said
E	no
B	I'm sure I must have said something
D	just no
E	I think it was just like he knew the things that would
B	wind you up press your buttons
E	yeah that's it press my buttons
C	it's like swearing it's only a word mum
E	it might not want to analyse that one
D	some of the language that comes out when he's when he has road rage
E	really?
B	oh he's quite yeah he swears quite a lot
D	yeah
C	where's
E	he's over there
C	thought he was in
E	no he's there
B	he's got no erm
D	no
B	yeah I don't really
E	you might as well go for the jugular haven't you? straightaway
B	he didn't have any problem with it
D	no no he doesn't care he doesn't care
B	I think it's good to be truthful and just cut the shit with people
D	yeah I mean I have a go at him for it all the time
E	oh definitely how do you
B	it makes you it makes you closer I think with people quicker
E	yeah was he he was okay with it?
B	you don't mess around with people
E	yeah yeah yeah yeah he doesn't
D	yeah yeah
B	you either chew it down or you
D	I'm always having a go at him to wear his false teeth
E	so did you actually kind of say so how do you eat without any teeth?
B	yeah well so how is it you know what I mean?
D	yeah do you find anything difficult to eat? and my dad said no which is a complete lie he completely avoids some foods now
E	oh does he?
D	because he finds it difficult to eat them
E	and does he just not wear his teeth cos it's uncomfortable?
D	yeah they make him gag
B	makes him gag
D	yeah and he threw up when he put them in
E	and then you get like a mental block don't you?
D	yeah
D	he's just got this kind of like stubborn old man thing
E	you'd think like hitting seventy
B	but it was
D	yeah cos I kept telling them his teeth was bad so I said why don't you just get a set of false teeth and they'll look much nicer?
B	and he listens to
D	so he did that
B	he eats cashew butter and watermelon and chia seeds everyday so that's
D	my mum hates me
B	turmeric on him
D	every time we Skype I recommend something else to my dad and my mum's in the background going no she has to go to like special shops to buy cashew butter and stuff
B	pay for it yeah
D	yeah a little bit
B	he's do
D	it's only over my dad
B	he'd do anything for
E	so how come
D	which in turn is why
B	surprised your dad hasn't given me a good good talking to
D	it's an
B	what you doing with my daughter? taking her off to these places
D	he trusts me
E	has he said anything to you?
B	no I thought he would do he looks like he looks like the type
D	when I mentioned Africa a little while ago there was discussions about breaking legs but he was just joking
B	but not break my legs
D	he didn't like the idea of Africa but he's coming round to it now
B	he didn't like the idea of any of the places we've been
E	yeah I must admit Africa is a bit daunting
D	yeah
B	we'll
D	but it it's daunting for us as well
E	but I trust in the fact
B	well we've had years of experience with erm
E	I was gonna say I mean you I know that you put so much he's doing it now you put oh you put so much time and effort into researching it that
D	yeah
E	I think we will need erm contact of sorts careful
D	no
B	it's not the safest part of the world is it?
D	when a child gets hurt
B	it's definitely not
E	are you comfy down there?
C	I'm alright yeah

D	well I I don't now that I'm back actually I keep buying uncut loafs of bread and they're really nice

D	but yeah it doesn't
B	it makes my stomach really tense and like
D	it's not a good thing to have
E	yeah bread isn't good for me either

C	and she just eats because he eats and they eat the same stuff and he doesn't put any weight on and she does
B	and she does yeah
D	with
E	she she makes a lot of cakes and things as well don't she? and
B	oh
E	probably the wrong thing
B	bakers are always fat
E	and she said also that erm

E	so she didn't have any exercise and

B	however
D	but there are
B	it only seems to work on the food that she wants to give a third away
B	if it's food that she doesn't want to give a third away then I have to fight her for it
D	there are particular things that I'm not willing to share basically
E	which is?

B	treat stuff like
D	or I won't have it again very often
B	like fancy stuff something nicer
D	yeah
B	lasagne or something no you share that in general

D	it's very rare that I don't give you some of my food
E	but sometimes you feel a bit stroppy and think I want this why do I have to give it to you?
D	yeah I'm actually really quite hungry
B	but I don't think it's fair to just do it when you want to it's a rule it's either always or not

E	okay that's what
D	doing yeah so I stayed there until I was eleven and when I changed I think when I went to that new school I just lost some of my confidence in competing with all these new students

[ANNOTATION]	Ds parents were catholic	Contradiction
E	yeah
D	I've always walked everywhere
E	yeah
D	but as far as anything else goes until we started hiking and running and starting to think about our health a bit more which I enjoy doing a bit more now I do like running
E	it's a lovely feeling isn't it?
D	yeah it is there's always that little bit of a war when you first get into it why am I don't this?
E	yeah yeah

E	that's a bit bad they don't have

B	yeah cos we can't study
E	could you not get your rent reduced because of it?
B	oh no
D	I don't know guess come as seen really
B	we think it probably already is reduced because of it I reckon some of the other places further down the street cost more cos we're right outside the lamp the light and right by the nursery
E	yeah
B	but anyone in our like within a kind of ten building radiance can hear it it's really noisy and we had another couple I already told
