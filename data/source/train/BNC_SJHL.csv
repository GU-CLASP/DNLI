D	my dad never did that
C	in Hebrew?
D	yeah in Hebrew
B	do you reckon he skipped bits?
D	he never skipped bits but it's like Claudia Roden says that in her family her father would go
B	mm
D	that is a common phenomenon amongst in Jewish families because nobody actually knows what the Hebrew means there are very very few people unless they're an orthodox family who know what the Hebrew means you're just phonetically reading it I don't know what it means

D	we did exactly the same thing I mean you know a a dessert spoon full of erm chicken schmaltz is the same as an egg yolk
B	what's chicken schmaltz?
D	erm rendered chicken fat
C	and
D	but I remembered that what I used to do when I made them was I would soak the matzo meal in hot water like like couscous and
C	yeah and that would obviously be much better
D	yeah
C	cos it's a very coarse
D	yeah
C	grain
D	yeah it is er oh god these are
B	I quite like mine

C	oh it's not kosher for this dinner if it if there's meat?
B	if there's meat but you could have it later or something you know? that's what I read on the internet
D	well we don't really care about being kosher
B	but otherwise otherwise it's all kosher
C	it doesn't have to be you can have Passover without it being kosher
D	mm
C	mm
D	well
B	in that case it's fine
D	I mean kosher if you were properly kosher well that's just impossible
A	the wine has to be made by a Jew
D	yeah
D	but that's
C	and I'd have to get
B	yeah
C	oven on
D	there should be a glass of wine on the table for the prophet Elijah
C	what you mean like leaving out
C	like leaving out
A	like for Father Christmas
D	yeah that's exactly what it is
B	mm
D	and at some point after dinner
B	he's gonna come?
D	it should've been before dinner I forgot to do it you send a child out to the front door to open the door and let him in

C	yeah
B	it looks good it's the right size
C	yeah
A	looks good love the tin foil
B	it's cos you were worried about the pan size you know it doesn't look like it went wrong
C	well it just made made me think that if it had been a twenty inch square it would just been a flat a flat
B	yeah
C	kind of and she'd
C	said to warm milk and to stir the bicarb into the warm milk
B	mm did it froth up?
C	no
B	oh that's weird
C	but she doesn't give any instructions in her I mean she just tells you what to do but she doesn't say erm this should take ten minutes you know like she might say beat until light and fluffy but she wouldn't say erm this will take ten minutes or erm

C	the Russian James Bond TV stuff?
A	it's called like Seventeen Moments of Spring and it like nothing really it's just like er it's it's funny how different it is to James Bond
A	it's just like some guy who lives a really like ascetic lifestyle and like undercover doesn't like have any
C	is it some kind of propaganda?
A	it's good though
B	it's it's it's it's really good it's really like poetic and the characters are really really strange and interesting

B	you know air bubbles to form
D	mm
C	but you were telling me that it didn't really matter today what erm the
B	definitely not to bake to bake a different size cake?

[ANNOTATION]	Person C had forgotten about the social security	Contradiction
A	although not
[ANNOTATION]	Person A is going to have a sandwich	Contradiction
A	although not usually listed as an ingredient air
B	can you do that in Hebrew? it's not traditional
C	I made a cake for my birthday in
B	the temperature is important
C	but actually I I think that I cooked it on the grill
C	it was good wasn't it? remember it was the orange
D	yes it was delicious it was really wonderful
B	you could do a grilled cake
[ANNOTATION]	Person B think he could make grilled cake	Neutral
B	be nice
D	but getting everybody I know has the same problems like you can't that you burn the bottom or you burn the top or one some bit of it burns because the oven isn't consistently delivering heat
C	in your oven? in your France oven?
D	the France oven is really difficult cos it's an old fashioned gas oven you know it's like bottom heat there's no other form of heat
B	mm
D	and so of course that is the problem
B	you just need to get the hang of whatever oven it that's the thing is at home I erm just just haven't really used that oven very much
C	mm
B	but after a while you figure it out like where the hot and cold spots are and then you can move things around so
D	but what do you do if the heat is all coming up from the bottom? you can't it's I've got these two huge kind of ceramic tiles in there
B	it should be okay if it's coming up from the bottom yeah you can put like a stone in
D	that's cos it kind of disperses slightly but everything I ever cook in there can gets bottom burnt it burns at the bottom
C	so glad that wasn't my computer
B	what? it's true
A	I know it's nice
A	the bit one was the best one was that
B	take that hat off before you make fun of me
A	don't don't be afraid
A	to get your hands dirty

B	he got into a dead spot on his like sat nav
B	because it's
A	no he didn't pull over he drove in circles
B	no he pulled over he was like I don't know like there's no internet I just have to wait for it to come back
B	it's was like
D	so where were going then?
A	we were going to
A	in the end I had to take his phone and like give him directions from like the map on the phone
B	we er we was calling people and
D	but what part of New York was it?
B	mm
C	dad and I had to do that the first time that we went to New York
A	well you must you must have been going to
C	no we were actually going to
C	but the guy took it the guy didn't know what direction to point his car in because he was
D	they're all er you know Ukrainian
C	well this wasn't this was a world class philosopher but they got absolutely
D	what driving the cab?
C	yeah
C	not not only no sense of direction or no common sense or no I mean no kind of real sense of any sort at all and
C	one of the things that he did
B	he does
C	when he picked up first of all he picked us up from the airport which was incredibly nice and I thought how sweet and then kind of followed him he's a very sort of
C	and then he
C	and we were walking
B	mm
C	and it
C	certain seats and then because you couldn't
A	yeah you can't
C	have I told you this story?
A	no but
C	and then and we came to a toll and he overshot the toll gate rather than reversing he decided to put his foot on the accelerator to lean to give him some purchase to lean back so he put his foot
C	the car was like revving
C	for all it was worth the
C	smoke burning rubber
C	and he was er trying to give five cents to the guy back at the
C	at the toll window
D	he sounds positively autistic
C	yes I mean he he was and really really really famous he's called
B	mm yep David Copperfield
C	anyway I can't remember his name it'll come back to me
C	erm oh I suppose

B	yeah
D	important area there
C	I suppose it was erm
B	New York cabdrivers are
C	analytical I don't know
D	they are famous minicab er New York
D	well cos it goes through immigration phases when I lived in New York all the cab drivers were erm Bengali or Indian or you know from the subcontinent but now they're all eastern Europeans apparently I don't know but in the in the late eighties
B	the guy the guy who got us really lost he was Indian
A	yeah
A	cos I went for a dinner with the guncles but and I didn't realise how long it had gone on for and I thought it was sort of one in the morning and I got back to the building we were staying at and it was seven forty or something
C	wow sorry you were
A	no no I was left the dinner and I thought
B	he lost track of time by six hours
A	yeah and I got back and I was thought it was weird when I was going back how quiet it was and then I asked the doorman sort of what time it was he was like yeah it's six forty-five
C	what did your guncles cook you for dinner? can you remember that?
A	what did they cook me for dinner? I can't remember
