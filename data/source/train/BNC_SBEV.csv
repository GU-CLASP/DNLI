A	yeah
B	so he's always just picking he doesn't really know what they are he picks up like jars of stuff

[ANNOTATION]	that family spends a lot of money in food	Entailment
A	yeah
B	they take everything out of packaging and just label it like tea

B	yeah for instance one thing they this couple the other night like marinated chicken
A	yeah
B	from Marks and Spencer
[ANNOTATION]	they keep everything in its original package	Contradiction
A	okay

[ANNOTATION]	speaker a is a good cook	Neutral
B	but I've all the time don't buy bolognese sauce any more or lasagne sauce I make that from scratch
A	yeah
B	but I was like how the fuck do you make a curry sauce from scratch? not that I would
A	yeah a little bit it's it's like tinned tinned tomatoes and coconut milk essentially
B	yeah
A	erm obviously it's got loads of other spices but that's like the bulk of it
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	just she was like and then she was
A	yeah
B	so
A	oh my god
B	I was laughing
A	yeah
B	out of nothing and they made that it's just like chopped roasted vegetables like courgettes
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	and shit and spices whatever you want with that and then I don't know what you put it with yet
A	well it sounds nice
B	probably new potatoes or something
A	sounds good
B	oh yeah
A	and I kind of like sprung it on mum I was just like oh and we've not got plans for Saturday shall we just invite our parents round? cos apparently since we've moved in we've never cooked for his parents which I think is quite bad

B	well if you wanna go to Tesco on the way back with me I need to pick up my stuff
A	I haven't got a clue and the like opinions that
B	yeah
A	and I don't really wanna do that and I don't wanna like I don't wanna pick something that's gonna take me ages either
B	no yeah that's good
A	yeah
B	I text your mum yesterday
A	did you?
B	last night
A	I'm sure she appreciated that
B	what did she say? I was like
B	I think I've lost my voice from screaming so much
A	yeah
B	yeah probably
A	I do I do I do enjoy the six nations we were actually out last night my dad
B	oh yeah
A	I don't know if I told you?
B	you did say ages ago about it but I don't think it would come round so quick
A	yeah so he's off on Monday for three months so
B	it was a good game
A	I do enjoy it
B	well he's not sport at all is he?
A	no
B	so maybe tennis but that's about it
B	I mean I don't I don't watch sport like
A	yeah
B	like just really
A	no
B	watching
A	yeah
B	cricket
A	it's a lot easier when you've got somebody to like get behind
B	yeah
A	I can't I don't I don't understand like
B	they like don't like support either convenience
A	yeah
B	they're like well we really want to see where they come in the cup it's like how on earth do you keep track of that? I'm like what fucking cup are they playing now?
A	yeah
B	is it a league game? or is it?
A	and it's so unnecessary as well because if you watch something like Match of the Day you kind of get a round up anyway so why do you have to watch like
B	it's more fun to watch that
A	weird weird
A	yeah
B	irritate winds me up
A	yeah
B	yeah I've really not been thinking it it's crazy
A	yeah
B	not thinking about and I just thought today oh god we're going to
A	that's very exciting
A	yeah
B	have you decided what day you're doing your
A	no I haven't really I haven't really planned anything I was actually going to speak to you about it because I didn't know whether you fancied doing like a joint something at some point like
B	yeah
A	I'm not doing anything on my actual birthday erm
B	find somewhere
A	yeah and then go go for some nice walks in the Peaks yeah on Saturday
B	that sounds really nice
A	erm so I'll be out Friday and Saturday anyway
B	I know I'm the same though
A	I just don't really care it's another birthday I don't know
A	yeah she's alright
B	she settled down south?
A	yeah kind of like I haven't really seen her in ages to be honest
B	it's more of a she's just there for work
A	yeah she's literally there just for just for the job and I think
B	the social side does grind on you a little bit doesn't it?
A	yeah it's just and like she's already admitting that she's not going to be able to do it long term and then I'm kind of thinking like
B	her and
A	yeah I mean I think they had they had
B	yeah
A	yeah well the thing is he actually just didn't wanna make plans he'd be like oh we'll probably do something at the weekend but then like wouldn't wouldn't actually like commit to doing stuff and she's like how on earth am I like meant to plan my life bearing in mind I like I live miles away like and we need to have plans like otherwise we're not gonna see each other I'm not gonna just hang around and hope that on a Saturday afternoon he rings me and says like are you free? do you want to do something?
B	that sounds more like dating
A	I know it's weird
B	ringing on a Saturday afternoon you know what I mean?
A	and like like
B	mm
A	and I thought right well everybody comes to that of their own kind of pace but like guys have been seeing each other like eight months now like
B	well sometimes
A	yeah
B	why worry about saying first?
A	exactly
B	I said it first
A	I don't really care
A	yeah
B	if you definitely loved that person
A	yeah
B	I think that would really grind on you
A	it's weird and I think she's worried about pushing him away like because this is his first proper relationship so I think he's
B	and he's very blasé about it
A	yeah I think he's finding the whole situation really intense it's really weird like I had quite an in-depth conversation with her about it at one point in that like it kind of seems like for ages he was holding onto the idea that like he didn't want to meet someone now like
B	has a set plan in his head
A	yeah he had a
B	no
A	like
A	like I had no plans to be in that position by the time I was twenty-five like
B	no
A	twenty-eight approaching thirty maybe but like not twenty-five
B	maybe
A	exactly like but the thing is when you meet when you meet someone that you're willing to make those plans with
B	things change
A	yeah things change so I think they're actually all the better for it it all come came to a bit of a head when
B	mm
A	erm
B	I mean that would be the best opportunity
A	yeah
B	they're the same group aren't they? I mean they're useless at making plans
A	yeah
B	could have
A	mm I don't I've I've only ever been once I don't know the way
B	oh
A	yeah
B	what a douchebag he should of let you go
B	I know it's a roundabout but seriously
A	I know
A	yeah everybody's good
B	yeah was he with a girl?
A	yeah it's all very strange so like obviously
B	Philippines I thought it was with her?
A	yeah so he met a couple of girls out there
B	mm
A	erm so they'd met before and they'd kind of hit it off so they started kind of like
B	yeah
A	so she'd come to his hotel room and at the weekend they'd kind of like sleep together and just hang out and whatever and then erm
B	so having a bit more of an intimate relationship
A	yeah like he said like he said the
B	she lives in Canada
A	yeah and she he wasn't really sure what to expect erm
B	god you two are like kind of similar aren't you really? you and
A	yeah oh I mean yeah
B	quite picky
A	me and
A	erm but yeah so he sort of thought like oh god like even things like you know he's asking her what her hobbies were and stuff like that she just didn't have any and it's just like what do you talk about with someone if they don't have like
B	I'd be like
[ANNOTATION]	The girl in relationship lives in Mexico.	Contradiction
A	hobbies or interests or whatever? and I was like I don't know erm
B	and he was there
A	and he was there and he was in Canada and embracing it and all this kind of shit but erm
B	try and be a bit like a toy boy
A	yeah so he basically got kept it was really weird he said he had a great time and obviously he got to see some cool things but he said it was weird
B	well at least he was smart
[ANNOTATION]	Someone was in Japan.	Contradiction
A	yeah
B	that way
A	it's a bit of a mood killer that though isn't it?
B	little bit
A	yeah erm
B	well
A	oh right my cousin is dating a guy off
B	well I get it though a little bit more because
A	yeah
B	so it works quite well but also it's giving you the chance to bump into that person locally without
A	yeah
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker's A cousin is gay.	Neutral
A	sometimes it takes away the like cos you know like
B	and then
B	yes yes yes yes
A	apart from there's obviously people on Tinder that just go yes
B	yes yes yes yes yes
[ANNOTATION]	Tinder was launched in 2005.	Neutral
A	yeah
B	don't have a inner world where you have to go to dance
A	exactly
A	and like we live in a world where like a lot of guys do just go out to pull
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	might be something else
A	easy world but I'm sure he'll meet someone but he's just like he's at a he's at a really weird point in his life where I don't think he really knows like what he wants so he doesn't know if he wants to stay in
B	he seems like he's living on the edge on the start of an adventure like trying to do all these different things
A	yeah
B	he hasn't spent all of it?
A	no
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A talks about a man that is divorced.	Neutral
A	but he goes

A	he works at erm Travelex something
B	oh
A	so he won't be on huge money anyway but
B	yeah
A	and and when they're talking about like saving for a house and all this kind of stuff like she's already basically admitted she knows that she's the one that'll have to pay the deposit
A	I think so all it's all a bit it's a bit strange anyway
B	yeah
A	and erm
B	mm
[ANNOTATION]	his salary is not very high	Entailment
B	yeah
A	because she knows like she knows she likes hosting and all that kind of stuff and carpets are just dangerous erm

A	yeah
B	like I could I could sense that they won't put it and they just put a it's happened to me
A	yeah
B	I was like they don't wanna do that or
A	well I think it's also the case of like they they
B	planning on top of their plans
A	yeah and they've made the mistake of sort of saying oh there's not much to do around the area
B	yeah
A	there's no need to put that really like cos I
B	oh don't be polite just by saying if you've got any options it would be great and then not accepting it
A	yeah
B	I like it
A	I think it's quite I don't know how she's going to
B	do it
A	organise it no
B	that's difficult
A	yeah and like with clues and stuff how are you going to be able to organise clues until you've seen the area like it's just a bit I mean I
B	yeah I hope we all get to go

[ANNOTATION]	person B is talking about sounds	Entailment
A	ah

A	yeah
B	I said oh bring cos dad wants to a
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about weather	Contradiction
B	like Sunday the twenty-eighth or something like that
A	yeah
A	I think it's almost better to introduce somebody in an
B	yes
A	if she just brought him home it would be very personal like meeting
B	parent
A	her parents and stuff whereas like when you when there's a massive group of you like that like you just have little conversations with people
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about parents	Entailment
A	people aren't like oh so you know tell me your life story like over dinner
B	yes and he looks really nice
A	yeah
B	I've seen a picture of him
A	I I don't think I don't think
B	and I know I not any more I said to
A	I think it's changed hasn't it?
[ANNOTATION]	they are sure it is change	Entailment
B	I think what I said to
A	yeah
B	all I said the only thing I would be conscious of was that would he have more kids? cos like you'd want to have kids
A	yeah
B	but obviously it's not something you want to do as an opening line
A	no
B	but then you don't wanna get too far down the line and be like
A	I'm sure that's you'd like to think that's something he would pick up on though
B	yeah I think so
A	even if you've got kids if you're if you're with a younger person you have to anticipate that they might want kids themselves
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	she's a year away from it I suppose and erm blah blah blah that she wouldn't be single forever and whatever and she's like oh no I might just
A	yeah
B	you don't
A	I think that's good as well
B	yeah I think he's quite smart
A	yeah
B	both boys
A	that was my that was my biggest like begrudge of like people like
B	yeah
A	that the breakup wasn't just breaking up with the dad it was breaking up with the kid as well which is just horrible
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	girlfriend troubles
A	oh yeah
B	she's got a kid I was like she is probably keeping you at arm's length because when you were there nearly all the time
A	yeah
B	you know you've already started and she probably keeps her life with
A	so what was the drama? like
B	I think that he she just needed her space
A	oh right
B	and she wanted to spend some more just one on one time with her son when she had the chance to rather than having him there as well
A	yeah
B	cos I can I can totally get that
A	yeah
B	but I said to just you know give her that time and like when it gets to ridiculous amounts of months or whatever
A	that way?
B	yes
B	and then at the bottom of here you turn right erm
A	yeah
B	but you don't want to push that thing you don't rush that thing
A	he needs he needs he needs to be a hundred percent sure that he's committed to that as well
B	oh he is
A	he is?
B	he totally is
A	good
B	he is oh god so much he like takes him swimming on his own he's like totally into it
A	yeah
B	the night before erm
B	and he was like oh no he's like no seriously I was like don't worry I was like what have you done? he goes oh well I've booked for her to go to a spa for two people I was like
A	yeah I'd be lucky to get a fucking card
B	said I I know standard I'll get I'll get some probably flowers
A	yeah bless him
B	I think he's moving tomorrow and everything
A	she's obviously just like you said being careful
B	she's being careful
A	really?
B	because I remember my first day at
A	what's her name?
B	erm she's two years older than
A	no I don't know her
B	I kind of recognised her
A	yeah
B	and erm
A	oh right that's weird
B	but he was obviously in her year
A	yeah
B	and then obviously looked at other people she was friends with there was like
A	yeah
B	and then
A	yeah
B	or whatever
A	these road are mental
B	but I think there is an easier way but they take this is the most
A	yeah
A	turns
A	oh so there's some drama there
B	I think it's alright now I think he thought that she'd like try and end it cos he was like oh she was like we're very two different people
A	yeah
B	come on cos she keeps herself to herself and he's like
A	yeah
B	I said don't take it as a erm erm bad thing I think you know you've just got to see where you are he thought it was like ending he thought it was over
A	oh ah ah
B	turning right here
A	is like they're older I suppose like I was just thinking like
B	yeah
A	you've got you've got kids and
B	got kids living next door to us soon
A	really?
B	who knows? I think I think he'd be mad to not to propose to her this year
A	yeah
B	and er
A	yeah
B	but I think if he's gonna do it I think he cos
A	yeah
B	I'd be I wouldn't be surprised if he proposed when we went skiing
A	okay
B	now I've told
A	asking yeah
B	asking him talking about it like I find it hilarious
A	yeah
B	but if you stop it like it's gonna be more of like a surprise like you don't wanna be feel like you've forced it
A	yeah
B	as such
A	and also like
B	yeah
A	you know it resets the counter well every every time she brings up him in
B	yeah
A	it resets the counter she's like fucking herself over
B	I will I'll say that to her
A	yeah
B	I was like you shouldn't bring that up
A	hope he does otherwise that's gonna be so awkward isn't it?
B	well she's given him like basically she's she turns thirty-three this year I think
A	it's here isn't it right?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	and I think that's why he's trying to hold off so much not so much to marry her
A	yeah
B	on one he knows that you know once he says will you marry? you know planning will go into full mode everything will be focused on that
A	yeah
B	and then
A	yeah
B	down this one
A	this one?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	I usually just park like parallel behind it
A	okay
B	oh the radio's coming on
B	no don't worry
A	I should of I should of like googled where it was I completely forgotten
