C	okay we're recording now
D	yeah
A	can can your voice be picked up?
C	yes because I can see the wave form
A	eh okay
C	I seem to have a very distinctive voice
D	oh that's good
A	yeah
D	how well it was received by people in the bar
A	em it well it seemed to have gone down quite well
D	yes
A	yeah it was a it was a a formal night
C	I thought there was a formal going on wasn't there or something?
A	yeah
C	they always have suits on no matter when
A	yeah
A	em and eh
D	oh yeah it's true everything's happening this week
A	em
C	does that mean that any lecturer doesn't actually you know like want to schedule a lecture for nine AM or what on Monday?
A	oh no they if anything they're gaining pleasure from doing so
C	welcome to torture
D	yeah because usually wouldn't there be some kind of like you know major deadline
A	yeah the thing is it just varies from person to person not even from subject to subject like
D	yeah and then Easter holidays used to happen and then everyone goes home and
A	yeah
D	presumably does no work or so they do
A	oh god yeah
C	wait a minute
D	everyone else goes skiing
A	em yeah
D	mm
C	that should be transcribed as cough cough cough
D	wasabi pea
B	wasabi pea
D	em yeah I I think it was like this was about six years ago
C	so you took it skiing and that's why it's so slow
C	it couldn't handle the cold and it's never recovered
D	that could be it
C	I just spent my money let's spend more
D	yeah
C	oh
A	ah
D	so I couldn't actually see everything that was on the screen which was not useful
A	mm hm
D	okayish
C	lift pass yeah
D	yeah and that was another hundred and then there was sort of like paying for food and the entertainment and they were really expensive like bars and places
B	where did you go?
D	oh was it La Plagne La Plagne in France I think
C	they they kind of knew about all these hidden costs to begin with so like yeah of course you pay a hundred dollars for a lift pass
D	yeah
C	of course you do that
A	you just You just leak money when skiing
D	that's the thing
C	I mean it's the thing that like you're in a ski resort is not like a metropolitan area or attached or anything cos it's in the
D	and so they can charge what they want
C	exactly
A	yeah
D	yeah
C	it's like it's like it's like being in a very extended airport but with more white and better maintained
D	basically there was a lot of white
C	less less hobos
D	yes there was definitely a lot of white and also cos you're doing so much skiing you're using energy all day so you're so hungry all the time
A	yeah
B	mm
C	that sounds delicious
D	it's amazing
A	do you you need a license for that now
C	well you see you buy you buy the gold lift pass and then you get on to the lift and all of a sudden a pot of like fondue and a steak appear
D	that would be amazing that might be a business idea
B	so cool
C	what did you have for breakfast?
A	I really hope that goes into textbook that's
C	what did you have for breakfast? I had chilli chocolate fondue steak
C	twenty-one day aged beef and you sort of get it and it's got a picture of Jamie Oliver winking on it and it's like nurgh
D	that's enough to put you off your food
C	yeah you think
D	I wish that had happened to me
C	what pigeon dive bomb you?
D	well not the pigeon part but the food
D	but all that ended up happening was that I em didn't know how to ski which obviously would have happened and as it was my first time and the first step was like sliding down a mountain for about fifty metres backwards going uuuaarh
D	to my friend who was at the top and couldn't help me
D	em yeah
C	was there some sort of just very large shrug of like oh I don't know
D	well basically I just didn't think I was ever going to stop
A	yeah
D	yes
A	it's it's not not so great for you know personal health em
D	that's the thing and you could so easily like break your leg or die
C	I like I like how those are two options it's either like well you can break your leg or you can just flat out corpse on the on the slope
A	well I have put off the idea of skiing at all because em someone I know eh sudden well I mean I I don't know her well enough but it's on on Facebook just eh she sort of vanished for a bit and then came back em okay it's fine everyone em I I I've been flown back back to the hospital in Ireland so I'm well enough that's alright and then just posting up all the pictures of the metal which is now in her spine
D	ooh god
C	oh
A	broke her back skiing
D	ooh
A	yeah I'm
D	yeah
unknown_female	yeah
D	yeah
C	it's the reason why all the sort of like the pictures of ski resorts have giant roaring fires it's like must keep the cold out somehow
D	yeah
A	the après ski
D	exactly
C	yeah
D	some people do that though
B	yeah I do that
A	yeah
B	have a sauna
A	yeah there is there there is the whole thing about people who go skiing just for the après ski
D	yeah
C	skiing posers
D	yeah
C	mind you I could say the exact same happen thing happened my dad was heavily into scuba diving and like you'd often like we got dragged along cos it was a tropical island in the Caribbean
A	I like how you said dragged along
C	well it was because it it it's exceedingly tedious and I was a bit of a dumb kid so it's like yeah why am I here?
D	I suppose if you're a kid it's not
C	well it's like what's there to do it's like my parent were like or you can sunbathe I was like I don't give a fuck
C	breaking the no swearing rule
C	ah it's very nice they dragged you dragged dragged to a Caribbean Island it was on it was on a massive discount because it was the last person last minute sort of drop out and they needed to fill the space with like anyone who would be able to pay the half rate
A	right
C	my dad do skiing my dad not skiing skiing on the water
A	because
C	and em they didn't want to be away and also it was a good excuse to have a reduced rate sort of fly out there while other people went
A	yeah
C	em on shore
A	mm
C	because scuba divers would come back dump a load of wet gear on them and say here you can sort this out? and it's like no what are you doing? And then scuba divers would then go into the pub and get drunk
D	that sounds like such a bad idea
C	well enough of them did it so
A	better than scuba diving when drunk?
D	well arguably
C	yeah
D	ooh
C	it's kind of like messed up the things that can happen to you scuba diving
D	that's really weird
A	now I've been put off going scuba diving
D	so let's let's talk about sky diving
B	yeah
C	that's actually that cos the thing is sky diving is the most dangerous sort of sporting activity and scuba diving's the second
D	really?
B	really?
C	yeah
D	what about bull fighting?
C	that's not really to be considered a leisure activity
C	at least not like the British like insurance and so
D	more just like suicidal
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	that sounds like a self help pamphlet
C	so you want to end your own life and the government won't help you cos they're dicks so bull fighting
A	vote
C	for a short but exhilarating life
D	ah you've got your new slogan?
C	yeah
D	I I think em
B	you'll just love it
A	oh okay
B	I've told you all week
A	thank you
B	they're really shiny
A	em I I still feel drunk
B	do you?
A	it's weird
D	what were your glasses like before?
A	em not like this
D	oh no
A	I managed to kind of bodge it back together very unprofessionally and put the lenses back in em so by then I went to the optician the next day to put the nose pad back on which is a very cheap and easy procedure
D	so there was severe structural damage?
A	yeah and I didn't tell him that that was because the previous night drunk at the bar at the gig I was going come on you frame with the thing
D	so you actually made it worse?
A	I well I
D	nice
A	I I definitely well I think to be honest em I think they were beyond help
D	oh nice
B	that is good
A	which was great especially because I was due to need
D	that's brilliant
A	yeah
D	so do you think that if you actually drunk alcohol you'd probably feel okay?
A	that's what
D	like yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah well let's
B	we can test it out later
A	yeah we we can
A	especially because he is one of the most ungainly clumsy people I know
D	that sounds hilarious
A	oh yes
D	em it was at
A	yeah
D	and my ball dress because em for some reason I hadn't really got my head around the long ball dress thing and I got do you know the dress I wore to the Fi and Dan's Wedding? It was like there is actually a picture of it on the laptop but anyway
B	yeah I'll know it
D	it's like like short with flowers on
B	yeah
D	basically the point is that it was short and therefore not suitable for a bouncy castle
C	so you flashed everyone then?
D	I may have done
D	the
A	it should have come with a warning on that dress
D	it should have done
C	warning your arse can be seen
D	to be honest I didn't really read the label thoroughly
C	part of the show
A	should have got a free ticket
C	nocturnal bouncy castle everyone always does that everyone does a back flip and then show their arse yeah you know
D	yeah
B	yeah
A	well I think eh they tend not to allow you to
unknown_female	oh yeah yeah
A	so it's ball pit and bouncy castle and black tie
D	oh my yeah
B	oh wow
C	I have seen a double side bouncy castle which was like double in both dimensions and well it did have a circular ball pit in the middle and as well as bouncy castle
A	it
C	it was it was the best thing until someone I don't know why I failed I don't know who did it but I know someone someone did and it closed the entire thing down
C	just holding a squeezy bottle of ketchup and of course when losing control of his momentum in the air he just sort of like brrr and just squeezed down on the bottle of ketchup
A	oh I'm looking forward to the transcriber trying to spell that
C	yeah there's like tomato ketchup everywhere out of the squeezy bottle Heinz all over the shop
A	oh and that is that is such a bugger to clean
C	yeah especially when you've got like you know an entire kit of playpen balls you've got to scoop out clean individually
A	yeah
D	oh yeah clean every single hose down
C	got your toothbrush out you know
A	no cos cleaning ball pits is genuinely quite difficult
C	just cos
A	they get they get they get quite dirty
D	yeah
A	you also end up losing a lot of stuff
D	earrings
A	yeah phones
D	money
A	em a lot of money
D	so there's probably a lot of valuable stuff on the bottom of the ball pit
B	yeah
C	well it's like it's like
A	yeah
C	the ball pit is like active sofa removal of objects
unknown_female	yeah
C	just sit down and all of a sudden it's like everything just slips straight out
A	it's it's like in my ideal house em there would be a room
D	there it is
D	actually my em friends did that
A	I like the way you're looking as though there epiphany
D	when you design houses
D	yeah my friends did that not with the glass floor though that would be difficult but with balloons
A	yeah
D	for a party
A	yes
B	that's cool
D	and it was like up till
A	love it
D	em neck height
C	yes
D	as soon as you're
B	yeah
A	well the one the one eh
C	it's impossible to get those things out of anything
A	it was
B	oh god
C	yeah
A	and the the next
D	oh dear
C	not quite a sort of good or numerous but you know when you get like someone who has eh puts like confetti on a table
A	yeah
B	mm
C	and they end up frigging everywhere and like if you've got any kind of mobile or living object like a cat for example who likes
A	new
C	or
A	buy yours now
C	but you know something some just something that moves and doesn't really give a crap if you're saying no kitten and stop eating
D	yeah
C	all these tiny little confetti silver foil
D	Cos they're just so small
C	yeah
D	what number wasabi pea is that? Was it number seven?
A	eight
D	eight? Oh so you're almost you're so close to liking them just two more and you'll just love them
A	them
D	instantly yeah
A	it's how it works
C	is this like some kind of initiation where you need to eat a certain amount to fall in love?
D	well
C	what?
A	what in general or with wasabi peas?
C	well I find that after eating about half?
C	am I just incapable of love until I
D	until you've eaten ten wasabi peas
C	and you
C	it's how all dates go or is it just me? I don't know
D	mm maybe if they cooked it and then you're like oh you're an amazing cook
A	and and frankly I I see marriage as simply eh you know for material benefits
C	oh you're very cynical
D	I wonder how well sarcasm will show up
C	like every line has a sarc mark at the end
A	we need a genuine we need a sarcastic punctuation mark
D	A sarc mark for G talk
A	yeah
D	just just for really dry comments
C	or you just you just do
A	em
C	that can't be transcribed that's not fair
A	there was an S M B C em comic on this recently that we need like this punctuation marks which we need and one of them was the sarcasm mark
C	yeah
B	what?
C	I'm gonna pay that so
B	to be sarcastic? Oh
C	without this you are you are not allowed like everything you say is little
B	yeah
D	it's a sarcasm fine whereas you
A	you really do
C	you see they're going to make an open access variant you know open sarc
C	you've just got the same thing but upside down and under creator comments two point five
D	wow
A	eh proper PLoS chat this
C	ah yeah
D	open gob?
C	I was talking about something about saying a shut the
D	oh dear
A	it it it tends to happen basically every day around five o'clock
D	is this the point where you're looking at pictures of tea and kittens and generally
C	no that happens when I'm
D	oh
A	I don't know
C	that was amazing
D	well that's a geeky one
A	it is
D	does that are they talking about Schrdinger's cat?
C	yes
A	yes
C	that's good
A	I've always wondered what would happen if you put Schrdinger's cat in Pandora's box?
D	have you said that to me before?
A	probably
D	yeah cos eh like my brain was like slowly working and I was thinking cats and physics Schrdinger
A	yeah
D	that's all I knew about it
A	yeah
D	I did know what it did at one point
A	I think that that guy had some really really good lines
D	mm
A	mm
D	and you weren't sure
A	yeah
D	it slowly dawned on you
A	yeah
D	and end on a good note
A	yeah
D	yeah
A	it's a lost cause and the whole thing will die em
D	yeah yeah
A	which I loved that
C	he really
D	he was really good yeah
A	no indiscriminately
B	Cos he was there was such a different like they were all such different styles
A	mm
B	like he would so he clearly thought about everything he was going to say and like he or that was just almost just his style
A	yeah
B	like his personality
A	yeah
D	yeah
C	he's very purple hair and he
D	he's very in the air
A	he is and he's he's very difficult to calm down and actually like he he he'll he'll do a set and you go okay well that that was good but you know and you give some feedback and say well this bit eh dragged on this bit you could have delivered funnier that kind of thing and he'll take it all on board and then not act on any of it
C	oh no
A	and he doesn't realise he's not acting on any of it because when he's onstage he's essentially just being him but to
D	but more extreme
A	or not even more extreme just he's actually almost trying to tone himself down
D	so is he actually funnier when he's just being himself?
A	em yes
D	so so but he's still not
A	he's actually a lot funnier not on stage
C	that's must be that's a really weird conundrum to have
A	yeah
B	yeah
D	but no isn't that the issue with stand-up comedians? There are some who are like have really good lines
A	yeah
B	yeah
D	and like everyone falls into one of those categories
A	yeah
C	he's a miserable sod
D	yeah
A	and he's not funny at all
D	yes
C	yes Dylan Moran Dylan Moran I
A	mm
C	like he can put on his sort of act mask
A	oh yeah
C	but it's kind of a level beyond his actual stand-up in front of the camera where he's like he's he's got another mask over his visual one
A	well yeah what what what he's doing is in in the context where normally that would be seeing behind the mask and seeing what he's what he's really like and what he's doing is pretending that but actually it's a different mask
C	yeah
A	so yeah
C	it's like an it's like an additional
A	yeah
C	on top of what he's already doing
A	which is trying to emphasise his onstage persona
C	yeah which is kind of crazy
D	see yeah I don't like there's too many masks too many personas like he just keep it simple
C	but he's still a funny man
B	yeah
A	my favourite comedians and they're the ones I essentially try to be like are the ones who come across onstage as being really genuine as as though they are just like people like Dara O'Briain and Ed Byrne
D	talking yeah
unknown_female	yeah
A	as opposed to they're doing a performance
D	did you see that thing about
B	yeah it was weird
A	yeah I was just going to say
D	yeah
B	in the pub? In the Isle of Man?
D	with her friend and who was like Oh Dara's just texted me
B	yeah and then it was like go she got back from the pub and then she said something like oh yeah I was at the pub with my friend like my friend
D	I think it was a different
B	right
A	wow
D	the Isle of Man?
A	the Isle of Man yeah
C	he he goes there to get away
B	maybe he was doing it surely
D	yeah
A	it's always interesting to notice so you're basically two links away from Dara O'Briain or are you three?
D	two well if she's met him two
A	well is it meet or know well?
B	she's probably scared him off
B	that works quite a lot
A	A friend of mine met Dara O'Briain just like he was just walking around a market I think and went you're Dara O'Briain and he went yes
A	and
D	and that was it
A	and had a photo taken with him and that was it
D	I can imagine yeah
C	he does seem really likeable
A	and you really do get the impression partly because he does so much improv in his shows you really do get the impression that that is just him having fun
D	yeah he's very natural
A	as opposed to him performing
B	yeah
C	I mean I I've seen Ed Byrne before actually in the Corn Exchange
A	oh yeah
C	and it was basically an extended pub conversation
A	yeah
C	like he was wearing sort of like you know he did a lot of hand motion and obviously this can't be transcribed but like hand motions out to the audience
A	yeah
C	like he was very sort of like and you and you and you and he'd sort of like go around and be very sort of like open and carry on em until he caught someone taking a video of the
A	yeah and then he ended up
C	yeah
D	oh no
C	but yeah I felt really bad for him but at the same time I was like ah you're derailing your own show so eh
A	yeah
D	so he just started ranting?
C	he did he did he started ranting he was like ah
D	but he must be relatively successful so why is he?
C	I know
D	mm strange
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	and that is that is such a shame
D	mm
C	yeah but the thing the thing is that most
A	like
C	well the thing is that people
D	the the problem is actually people uploading the professionally recorded things onto You Tube
C	oh yeah
D	yeah
A	that's really the issue
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	which is garbage to look at like two forty by one sixty video is like looking at a tea stain and saying oh yeah it's the Clangers
A	eh that's
C	yeah
A	wonderful wonderful
C	and
C	you become like this insane man
C	well the the thing is
C	and it's right in and it's right in front of them
D	yeah
C	like it is literally in front of their face and they're like well I could've gone down to HMV and nah
D	mm
C	so like it's one of those things
D	because surely it just popularising his stuff like
C	well that's one argument you can take
D	so more people will go to see it live
A	and I and and also they they I don't know I don't really see that argument that he has because is I don't think the standa-up comedians get much revenue from their DVD sales
C	I think he's
A	like not compared to ticket sales
D	yeah
B	yeah
C	I think it's I think it's a nice bump though like it's a nice thing in the off season when you're relaxed
A	mm
C	yeah
A	em it it it isn't quite that bad I imagine they do probably get like I don't know a quid for every DVD or something
D	yeah
B	mm
A	that's where all of the money is generated
C	yeah
D	exactly
C	yeah
D	it must be quite difficult to like actually have a life
A	I I like I like what Ed Byrne said about this in an interview actually
D	yeah
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	you know it's
D	I've often wondered what people like stand-up comedians and like evening performers do in their daytime? Like I guess they have to rehearse especially stand-up comedians because like they usually have a routine right? But they probably don't vary all that much on tour?
A	and there isn't much like sound checking you have to do and stuff
D	yeah
A	mm
D	their lines well you know
C	get ripped
A	I think
A	and
D	yeah
B	so you get you end up getting up like late morning or something
D	yeah
A	yeah
D	yeah
A	to get a feel for the place
B	yeah getting the local newspaper and stuff
A	well yeah I mean that kind of stuff if if you have the time for press
D	so you can relate to your audience
A	yeah
D	but then maybe that's fine cos maybe that helps them to like maybe even though they know it's obvious it's just okay cos it helps them establish a relationship
A	well it it depends on on the audience I mean it
B	mm
A	and they em whereas em yeah I mean
B	yeah
A	I think I think it's at how it's delivered
D	yeah
A	em like there's that Mitchell and Webb sketch the eh rocket scientist and the brain surgeon?
D	yes
A	and you can see the joke coming a million miles away but it's just delivered in such a way where they know you can see it coming
D	yeah
A	and then they just
B	it's just so well set up
A	it's just delivered perfectly basically it
C	yeah
A	mm
C	so yeah I'm not
D	well he is from like Devon or somewhere isn't he?
C	point yeah
D	maybe it's some sort of
C	maybe he just like got beaten into that sort of like yeah
D	yeah
C	you know
A	you do love stereotypes
D	well he's from Bristol
B	yes
C	of course
A	you do
D	definitely
A	I was reading em Dara O'Briain's book
D	is it the number ten?
C	the tenth The tenth wasabi pea
D	okay okay
B	so it is the tenth you'll like or the eleventh?
D	ooh good question
A	is it after ten or on ten?
D	I think you should have a second one just to be sure
B	well how did you feel about this one? Undecided?
A	well I'm starting to find them okay but I still wouldn't chose to eat them like
B	yeah
A	okay
B	yeah
D	then you'll choose which one to finish the packet
B	you're not over that tipping point
A	yeah
D	see I used to feel like that about wasabi
B	it's just not
A	yeah
C	schrdinger
C	the pain is good
D	I do have I do have that with regard to wasabi and chillies
C	no no they
A	phrasing
C	the chilli didn't beat me I fell down the stairs
D	and then sometimes I'm cutting them and em like chilli juice on my finger and then stick it in my eye
A	I like the way you stick it like when on my god that's inconvenient arrghhh
D	yeah
A	yes em
D	I'm probably not jabbing myself in the eye deliberately
A	yeah
D	that's the thing
A	I quite like that it if if the cos some of those have been really strong and some of them haven't been em and the ones which haven't been so strong I've really liked the sort of underlying flavour
B	hit the the yeah the general
A	hit the actual pea basically
B	yeah
A	and em
B	the desiccated pea
A	yeah
D	it sounds awful but it's just amazing
A	yeah
D	does it kind of taste the same but white?
A	it's the I I I honestly don't know because I don't like it so I don't eat it
D	mm
B	no
D	I don't know
C	my dad
A	only freaks
C	oi
D	does he eat it with beef? Or just out the jar?
C	no he eats it with beef eh generally
A	I like the way you won't go urgh but then you do that with Marmite
C	Marmite is good
D	what? You eat marmite out the jar?
C	no
D	eating Nutella out of the jar
C	no it's not why would you eat peanut butter out of the jar? You need you need something to cut it with
D	Cos it's amazing
B	yeah
C	okay yeah but that's kind of going on a bad that's going down a bad slope
D	yeah
C	it's not the same as like eating
D	that's pretty amazing
B	oh that's good
C	that's that's required
unknown_female	yeah
C	it's it's brilliant
B	it is it really is
C	ah yeah you can
C	you've you've been deprived as a child
B	I think I don't believe that cos my mum always used to say that to me but no one ever told me about the lion stamp meaning that it was salmonella free
C	yeah
B	so I did get deprived and now I'll make up for it
C	and now And now you know your mum was hogging all the cake mix
A	you see I was always
D	lick the spoon
B	lick the bowl yeah
A	lick the spoon
B	yeah it was really good yeah
C	yeah
A	and that was just me for half an hour
D	do you think your mum used to deliberately leave bits like leave plenty for you?
A	I think she probably did because you'd look it and go and you could totally get another cake out of that
C	yeah
D	so basically just have some cake mix for dinner
B	Good idea
C	probably why she baked so often
D	yeah
A	I I can't I can't confirm but I think I was a bloody irritating child
A	em I I I'm assuming this because I think most children are bloody irritating and I was a talkative little git
D	if you're asked your
A	well yes
B	are you the oldest?
A	youngest
B	oh
C	got to make up for the age
A	but eh em yeah
C	hammering on
A	well well my brother
B	that's not good
A	not even cooked chips
D	didn't your mum like force-feed him vegetables?
A	tried and failed
C	how can he not eat pizza?
A	and thought
C	Jesus
A	em now
C	he doesn't need to explain the fact that yeah I'm a picky git
A	yeah
D	you could also probably rule out mm
A	oh he loves cheese so well he loves bland cheese and it has to be just cheddar or or mozzarella

A	cucumber?
D	well good things
A	cucumber

C	let's
A	an exhilarating but short life
C	hey who says that a exhilarating life would not involve cake? It would involve cake
D	it would have to involve cake
C	yeah
C	A muffin covered in frosting flying in your face constantly
A	just
D	having cake like shoved into your face is probably not as fun as actually like taking your time to eat it
D	I'm
C	was it like an entire family thing where everyone just keeps giving you books?
B	oh dear
D	em no
A	quite a few of it
D	grammar
C	hey stop it
D	who needs grammar? Anyway em
A	Us

C	we do have
A	yes
D	it's hard to do both things at
C	what?
D	it's really
B	oh wow
D	like
A	it needs a context-free trial run
C	yeah
C	how about your mem?
A	well a context-free trial run literally means just bake it and see if it's good
C	what?
D	well
A	yeah
C	so you have to just you have you've started making two cakes at one just to sort of stop yourself
D	mm
A	I I think I think that
C	the defence cake and the a and you know the the the the shield cake which will stop you from eating both

D	oh no
A	silicone spatula sounds like a band name

A	yeah
C	so what she got a spatula that basically conformed to the side of this the the em bowl
unknown_female	yeah
C	so my mum's like here's the bowl and it's like there's fucking nothing in here what are you doing to me? You're killing me here
D	that's why you got to make your own ones
B	he sweared
C	yeah that's how I started
D	I saw some
C	it's just an excuse to have em icing which any excuse for icing will give an excuse for icing
D	it does
C	that's his scanky brother
D	yeah
A	yeah who was less successful and just keeps
C	well you know I did my best
A	like oh you know I I didn't have as good teachers and
D	is that what they say in Scouse land?
A	what?
D	what are you talking about?
A	I tried to come up with the good excuse
C	anyway cake
D	never mind back to cake is always the fail-safe option
C	imagine you could have like a cos you can have a Cream Egg of a like cake shell with like butter icing in the middle
A	have you ever done that thing where you get a whole Easter egg and fill it with in the like stuff in the Cream Egg so you have a giant Cream Egg
C	God no
A	it's
D	how would you do that?
B	really?
D	like can you just buy Cream Eggs inside
A	we we got absolutely loads of cream eggs and spooned out the icing in the middle and filled
D	but then you essentially have the same thing
A	yeah
B	isn't that the same as having lots of Cream Egg?
A	well well well well obviously yes but we were making it
D	oh
A	have you never seen pimp my snack?
C	that is the dumbest thing
D	it was a big thing on the on on the internet like a couple of years ago or something
C	not not don't care
D	giant Kit Kat Chunky
A	yeah yeah
D	like yeah gaint Kit Kat
A	it was really cool
B	was it?
C	it sounds like It sounds like some sort of
A	that that cream stuff is really really tasty in the quantity you have it
D	Cos it's like sugar
A	once you start experiencing it in any way touching it smelling it seeing it em
D	how did you like did you just cut them open and spoon it out?
A	mm
D	okay
A	it took a long time and then we just realised like why are we doing this and then someone else said well because we're sixteen and we got nothing else to do
D	it's better than going out drinking on the streets
C	and you haven't got high speed internet line yet
A	we didn't even have internet till I was sixteen
D	plus you were in Durham
A	you are not allowed to say that
D	why I'm I not allowed to say that? I lived somewhere even more than Durham
C	you climbed out
D	actually I liked Durham
D	hence the Cream Egg thing
A	yeah
D	what about London?
A	well well
C	even though you have to pay for it so it's
A	exactly
C	and your parents won't give you any cos you'll just be you'll just keep siphoning it off of them
D	you must have a lot of money to buy all those Cream Eggs though?
A	we saved up for about a month
C	pocket money
A	yeah
C	do something really dumb
A	well I in in the end how it turned out I spent most of it on being unemployed
D	what was your job?
A	em before eh this one it was eh Sidney Sussex in the admissions office and that was just a two month placement
D	what about the one when you were sixteen?
A	oh that
C	oh wow
D	something to do
A	sounds sounds so much cooler than it was
D	stuff to do
A	no it wasn't
C	isn't most of it just like rebuilding tyre walls when idiots climb and smash into them
A	yeah
B	you didn't get free rides?
C	no it was really
A	go-carts are amazing
C	no they're not
A	I was never allowed to drive them

D	PLoS trip go-carting
B	PLoS trip
C	I mean it's not it's not like you know
A	we totally you should go carting it is the most fun
C	how about bowling? Bowling is good though
A	no
C	I can't I can't I
D	is that because you're too tall for a cart?
C	no it's because I have no like space awareness whatsoever
B	do you drive
D	yeah isn't it like
C	God no
B	oh
D	I was gonna say isn't it like driving?
A	it's

[ANNOTATION]	Two speakers have driven none times in the past.	Entailment
D	A hundred laps? That actually sounds like it would take quite a long time
A	A
C	it did
B	it sound was a bit dull actually
A	I
D	yeah
A	because it would for one thing actually require very significant physical fitness
C	well yeah
A	mm
C	basically like
D	is it just like steering round walls and round? Is it like an obstacle course?
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B doesn't think kart is very interesting.	Entailment
A	well if if it's if it's indoors yeah
C	tyre barrier Tyre barrier of best fit
D	strategically I E in the way
A	yeah but em yeah it's
C	mm
A	because the forces the G forces are like quite quite something
C	and they're not exactly
A	and if you're not properly pushing it and being aggressive
D	go-carting society
A	yeah and em
A	em I love carting
D	em did your brother like it because did he work there as well or did he just like it?

D	and tried it
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker D had decided to do try that.	Entailment
A	alright okay
D	or free basically
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	but most of your extremities or things that are bruised easily are exposed like say your elbows
A	oh yeah
D	the top of your head
C	yeah
D	I got a green paintball
A	mm
C	if you get shot and die you just go to a chat window
A	yeah
C	so it would be like you get hit by three in your chest and go okay that's fine that winds me a bit two on your arm it's like ah and you just sort of
D	yeah
C	and one of my friends had a brilliant idea of trying to be a sniper
D	yeah
C	and we
C	by accident
A	that's that's the best ending to any anecdote
C	no no we're still going we've got five more minutes
A	five more minutes okay
C	but I
D	knees ooh
C	he couldn't even walk straight for a while because he got he got like one welt just underneath his kneecap and so it hurt like hell when he would bend his knee in any fashion for the next two days
A	yeah
C	and we'd all remember the bruising and the pain that mild sort of grumbling
A	yeah
C	you know that sort of thing and like especially seeing as like I remember we had to do the PE and our teacher would just laugh at us he was like ah you're all idiots what are you doing you don't go paintballing ha ha ha
D	your teacher laughed at you? That's terrible
C	he was he was a he was a very em ribald sort of just jolly chap who loved taking the piss out of his students
A	yeah
D	well yeah
C	he was also my English teacher it was the most weird sort of like split character you could have
D	that is weird
C	he did whack people on the head with a copy of Twelfth Night at times
C	well it's all
D	sarc mark
A	thank you
D	oh no
A	so so why do you hang around with Claire? Well she's my portable punctuation
C	well you got you just down the you're just down at the pub
B	oh I could really do with one of them?
C	she just
D	that would be amazing
D	I like that link
C	I give you a full
A	occasional wasabi peas
D	yes
C	yeah a packet of Haribo a day
D	em yeah that link that you sent around unnecessary quotes
A	oh that's
C	I was sent that as well
D	yes
A	it is so much fun
C	it's a Tumblr of em just quotes put in places where they don't need to be
A	quotation marks
C	yes
D	so what do I have to do to get this coffee?
C	it comes across as like free coffee
D	which is just highly suspicious
C	yeah
D	there was on the van like the van it said plumber
A	yeah yeah your neighbourhood plumber
D	yeah
C	the easy thing is imagine he's some sort of sarcastic prat
A	yeah
C	sort of like you know doing the actual like air quotes while you say
A	it it is great fun to I I want em like
D	that would be really difficult to do
A	it's it's a little bit like the whole the X K C D thing of putting like putting actual size on eh on all adverts
C	I love it
A	which is again another of those X K C D things they stole from well they didn't steal from me but I also thought of it
C	yeah
A	slightly later but before I saw it
A	yeah he is
C	well it's like it's like the one where
A	I think if I if I met Randel Munroe we would get on very well
C	well he also loves ball pits so you'll be you'd be on the same wavelength
A	yeah
C	but I remember there was there was one where like it said you could put on fake like sort of like
A	yeah
C	if you put a product that doesn't doesn't naturally have any fat take out or something that wouldn't be fatty to begin with and you
D	like Coke
A	say that
C	and you put
A	yeah
C	so everyone else has to do the same thing
A	it's it's exactly
C	I thought I was getting that from somewhere
A	the the Carling advert which said a hundred percent British hops
C	yeah we have
A	we grow we grow and also the ones which are grown elsewhere are hops better suited to European style
unknown_female	yeah
A	I mean of course you're marketing it to British people of course you're gonna use British hops
C	well it's like saying eh you know when you make like Guinness it's like oh yeah we use
A	yeah
D	yeah but why are you importing water when you've got it yourself
C	yeah
A	Cos the
D	well mm
C	we can appeal to brainless nationalism
A	yeah
D	I was gonna say it's
A	yeah
D	side of things
A	but then that's the slogan you don't have to go far for a better beer
D	that's brilliant
A	oh
C	yeah
A	oh it's it's nothing nothing works better than Anadin all over again
B	how did they not pick up on that? How?
A	I
D	Sniggering
A	and just like making eye contact and going
D	yeah because you presume that
C	they're already making their spoof blog
D	like if they've got that high up in the company
A	I'm buying me one of those coasters
D	they should be reasonably intelligent
A	yeah
B	really?
A	successful company they they should especially if your job is in like all of these slogans are always over-thought to the extent where it's just mind-numbing
D	so it's it's like what's that phrase? Is it you can't see the wood for the trees?
A	yeah
D	yeah when
C	it comes overly
A	it must it must have been yeah
D	you need a second look to come and like
A	but
D	yeah
A	like it's such an obvious I can
D	but that person has to be a powerful person
A	yeah
D	I suppose
A	otherwise they'll go like oh no no you're not seeing what we're seeing
C	well they had to be sanctioned by marketing as an outside observer
D	yeah
C	and we're we we've filled up our time
B	yeah
D	yey
A	Good
