A	no under like the whole bed is you couldn't move it we'd have to move it every time like
C	just move the bed somewhere else in the room
A	there's nowhere that you can put it like cos there's a wardrobe at the top end so you block your wardrobe or you've just fuck all floor space so anyway I was
B	have sex on the floor
A	yeah that wouldn't be very comfortable though would it? and they'd be able to hear it
unknown_female	yeah

B	fucking
D	hang on what's this?
A	why what'd she do?
C	basically we're paying a lot er I can't even remember

A	estimates go on the people who lived there last year
B	oh we're not like them dickheads they were all proper
B	yeah
B	I don't if it's seventy pound a month I'll be very surprised
A	but the point is it unit cost that were higher
B	mm yeah
A	if you're playing like
unknown_female	yeah
A	fifty pence more a unit than if you'd switched
B	mm
A	so it's like so expensive regardless of
B	yeah I had nothing to do with the whole gas electric thing I don't know who we're with now I have no idea who are we with? who are we with British Gas?
A	EON and British Gas no Npower and British British Gas
B	and I don't know like these letters come through and
A	I know this and I don't fucking live there
B	I have literally no idea I don't know if we're gonna switch or not
A	go on you were gonna tell a story about
B	yeah go on tell a story about
A	you've got to you've got to tell us
D	I can see how pissed off you are already
B	she she were fuming here she was like
D	I didn't even read the conversation properly I just saw everyone kicking off
B	when when er
D	are you all are you all
B	listen to me
D	is it your house chat or is it?
C	our house chat
D	and will you be don't it with
B	yeah I was there I was doing most of the playing
C	so for the however long me and
D	er so
C	yeah she's been saying we're spending way too much money on this this and this and I was like right okay now the thing about me is that like I'm a hoarder of information and when I need it I'll use it so she's been telling me this for weeks and weeks and weeks and I've just been nodding and saying yes and like she's been saying I think we need to suggest about changing I go like yeah okay yeah okay whatever whatever cos I'm not I wasn't
D	how much was it?
B	only for two of you it was that much like expensive?
C	well it was the estimate that they'd given us it was like
A	seventy pound just for electric
C	a month
B	just the two of ya?
A	and you and you use twice as much gas as what you do electric so you use gas twice as much a month normally
C	so I was well fucked off and I was like this isn't happening so I was with you wasn't I?
A	mm
C	so you told me to have a look so we started to have a look this that and the other and I'd put on on Facebook chat I've got this I've got this letter
A	five hundred pound a year can't ya?
C	you could save this amount of money if we change to this and
B	like completely ignoring
C	completely fucking blank me bearing in mind she's been giving me all this shit about changing and I was like what the fuck? I didn't put anything because I'm getting close to my last tether with
D	yeah
B	sorry but that would happen wouldn't it like you yeah
C	don't get me wrong I do like the girl but she is full of shit
A	she is full of shit
D	I think she's full of shit and I don't even really know her that well
C	she's such a lovely girl
B	she is lovely
C	but she's been treated like such a fucking princess all of her life
B	has she?
C	yeah
B	I though I though her dad were a bit of a prick to her like
A	she says that but
C	she says that for fuck's sake
A	I was like
C	I'm not being funny but where do you think her mum gets the money from?
B	yeah must be her dad yeah
C	she lost a set of Ray-Bans in a taxi cos she forgot to pick them up her mum felt sorry for her so she bought her a new pair if that was my mum she'd have gone fucking do one you were the one that lost them you can pay for a new pair but anyway apparently she got insurance on these ones so it doesn't really matter if she loses them again
D	Ray-Bans aren't that expensive obviously like
C	they're not but
D	a hundred and
C	no
D	but I wouldn't insure them
C	no now I'm not saying that she I guess she didn't expect them to be bought for her
D	mm
C	but her mum did it anyway yes it's a really really nice gesture but the whole point is is that she lost them herself it wasn't like they were stolen or like she lost them basically so yeah
C	she is
A	it is bullshit about her dad I think you know
B	I have no
C	well the thing is is that like I walk in after I've been at at god it was like the second week I'd been living with her I'd been at work all week and I was absolutely knackered and she'd been saying to me I'm such a clean freak when it comes to the kitchen I don't like any crumbs in it like

D	yeah
unknown_female	ah

B	yeah
A	like a child would
D	yeah like he just found it hilarious and he'd like sort of like play fight with her and stuff and she
C	oh god if that don't say I fancy you then what does?
D	used to get like genuinely like like genuinely annoyed her erm and he'd go into her room like you heard of what but I felt like proper like he made me feel like quite excluded
unknown_female	mm
D	like he'd just go in
B	those walls are a bit too thin
A	oh so thin
A	yeah
D	I used to get so annoyed with him
D	I never heard
A	well I had that with one of my flatmates erm she was from Sri Lanka and her parents and her family were like really really strict she literally had to ring every single one of the family members every single night and her mum'd ring her at eleven o'clock to make sure she was in bed like she was never allowed to go anywhere after nine o'clock
unknown_female	oh god
A	she had to like she had to go in by nine and like she'd have to ring every single one of her family members have a full conversation with them and she'd be on the phone to like one o'clock in the morning and get up at seven and start again like as soon as she woke up in the morning as soon as her eyes were open she were on her phone talking to someone
B	why?
A	I don't know because like you'd speak to her in kitchen and she wouldn't say two words to you
A	but like because she used to speak in Sri Lankan or whatever language it were like she used to get louder and louder and louder and like all you could hear even if you had the TV on anything would hear constantly
B	those walls are thin
A	and she was so loud though like you couldn't hear anyone else who were next to me but
unknown_female	yeah
A	you could hear her in the kitchen from her room that's how loud she were
B	I was the loudest in my flat me me and
B	so I'm banging on the wall going wake the fuck up you stupid prick he sleeps through the whole thing and cos our bed and he puts his phone here and this is our wall so the whole it vibrates my wall

C	I once I once found
B	yeah it vibrates
C	and she was like really? like and I was like well put it this way I think you got at least seven phone calls
B	I I drew the short straw of being in room
C	thankfully I only had one person
D	I was in room A next to the kitchen that's why
B	room A's bad and room B's nearly bad cos they're conjoined like the beds are conjoined and I see
