D	yeah so this is the kitchen yeah it's a good space as well
E	ah
D	but if you look out long enough
E	we'll look at them later shall we?
D	yeah so that's nice I like the bay windows as well
E	yeah
D	cos it's like a nice big open bright space
E	yeah so there wasn't any problem when you got here?
D	no no
E	just signed the contract and everything
D	no no
E	after all your hassle beforehand
D	I know god it was stressful it came really close it
E	oh I felt for you guys I really did
D	if this place hadn't have gone through I don't think we would have
E	I know
E	yeah was he coming he'd got to the point where it was kind of like er that's it everything's against us
D	yeah yeah
E	it's telling us not to go back I'm English and I can't get in the country
D	I know basically you know
E	yeah it did feel very unfair though
D	I mean we could have been going travelling but it worked out fine in the end
E	yeah
D	it was just those few weeks in Korea trying to get it sorted
A	was that your bad toe?
E	it was my bad toe you just trod on
D	oh no oh no what did you do to your toe?
E	I fractured it
D	oh
E	yeah fell down some steps when we went to
D	oh were you there?
E	you were weren't were you? yeah but I erm
A	and you got stung on the bottom
E	I did get stung on
D	I bet you've been going to school telling everyone that and what happened in your summer holidays?
E	ah you look like you've moved in really well
D	but yeah the only thing was was the wallpaper was the only thing that we weren't like thrilled about but it's clear the landlord isn't taking too much care of the place
E	yeah
D	yeah I know
E	and then it was like the before and after photos
D	before and after shot I know I think it was like female tenant male tenant
E	you've got a blender

E	I've got a good feel of this place already
D	okay yeah the bathroom was in okay condition which was good there was no damp or mould or anything
B	the fan is terrible it's really really noisy
D	yeah at the moment
B	once it's gets going
D	I thought it was gonna blow up when it was in the shower the other day
E	oh what? what up there you mean?
B	yeah
D	yeah
E	what's that then?
B	it's the fan extractor
D	the extractor fan

E	what's that? is that heater there?
B	that's a heater yeah
D	that's a heater apparently
B	woah
D	banging out a tune
B	gotta do it like this
D	actually scared me the other day
C	does it work?
D	yeah yeah yeah I mean it helps but we erm we have all our windows open quite a lot anyway so at the moment it's not a problem I suppose it will be when winter comes we'll notice more
E	yeah maybe
D	but it's really sounds like it's struggling sometimes
B	you've almost got it
D	but they wrote that down on our inventory you know we had the external company come and do an inventory
B	they were very thorough
E	yeah yeah
D	they were very thorough
B	you know like a
E	oh that's good
D	so
B	but the windows are filthy absolutely filthy
D	that's something I suppose
B	it looks like somebody's thrown something against that one
D	mm that's the bedroom
E	yeah they just can't get the
D	oh the bed oh thank you for bringing the bed up
B	there's a crack in the window down here a few other cracks
D	mm
E	have they marked all that? they know all about that? yeah
B	it to be fair
D	most of it had been noted so that's good
B	it's a bit rough around the edges but it's spacious there's quite a bit of space
E	ah that's great
D	yeah we have a balcony
B	yeah we've got a little balcony
D	it's very small it's big enough for one
E	oh but that's
B	you can just get out there
E	and it's nice on a hot day to open up and
D	yeah yeah
B	on a hot day
E	nice
D	we've had a couple actually I feel like we've been really lucky
E	really nice
B	yeah well I'm wearing a thermal shirt
D	we've had more sunny days than not since we've been back since we've moved into the flats
E	you might have to erm
B	looking pretty good
D	yeah we are for the bed
E	the bedding yeah
D	cos the bed won't fit where that is
E	and there's drawers that go underneath it as well so you'll have a bit more storage space
D	yeah
B	yeah
E	oh did you?
B	everything's a bit
D	no not that one these
E	oh
B	these things
E	oh yeah
B	everything's a bit hodge podge
E	no I think you've done brilliantly considering everyone's kind of like given bits and pieces
D	yeah well thank you for all that
B	yeah
D	yeah really
E	yeah
D	it has
B	it's good
D	it functions perfectly so yeah
E	yeah
B	yeah as you said
D	I don't think there is anything that we need
E	and this your this folds down into a bed
D	yeah yeah so this is a
B	yeah and it's we well
E	yeah
E	it's great
D	it's like quite a thick mattress so it should be fine it's a good size as well
B	so yeah if you wanna come and crash over we'll crash on here
D	so
E	right go on then go on the sofa
B	right yeah
D	yeah are you gonna construct the thing?
D	do you want a cup of tea first?
D	oh is there? yeah shall we go and come down?
D	alright then we'll keep talking
E	these are great okay you're not gonna get much recorded
E	so it might encourage him to go down with you
D	when I was at erm my parents before we moved there was always the grandchildren over and it's just impossible they're always interrupting and making noises and screaming
E	yeah
D	er well I I just didn't there was too many children
E	oh right yeah
D	it was a if I'd got my parents in like the kitchen by themselves or something like that then
E	yeah
D	then I
E	you have to do a kind of stop start stop start
D	yeah yeah
E	and then you have to patch it together
D	yeah which gets a
E	yeah yeah oh so good to see you
D	I know it's kind of surreal that we're all here
E	I know it does it feels
D	in Brighton
E	it feels lovely finally kind of see you together
D	yeah yeah yeah I know
E	it's been difficult
D	that's what my parents said
E	you know getting obviously when you come home it's like you need to see your parents and family
D	yeah
E	and everything and vice versa
D	we're never home long enough are we?
E	yeah
B	no
D	my parents came down on Monday was it this Monday?
B	yeah we had a few
D	my mum just went home like when we moved she was like it was so nice to spend the day with both of you
E	I know I know lovely
D	and to be able to just jump in the car and do it
E	yeah exactly
D	so
E	but no I mean you've been living your lives and you know
D	yeah we've been enjoying it
E	yeah definitely
D	been a good few years
D	mm
E	see do you remember when
D	yes?
E	you handsome boy
D	he's really handsome isn't he? he's a really good looking boy
D	does he remind you of either
E	he's character is very much like
D	oh is it?
E	very much yeah
D	okay then
E	but he erm looked more like erm
D	yeah I guess he's fairer isn't he?
E	was little
D	yeah
E	there's photos that we look at him the shape of the face not so much now as he's getting older
E	but he so reminds me of
E	as a child just you know he's just active constantly
D	constantly ah
E	from the time he gets up to the time he goes to sleep
D	oh they're so active
E	like he's
D	he's
E	got Duracell batteries in him
D	yeah yeah
E	and and
D	yeah yeah come and see this come and see this
E	yeah yeah
D	cos
E	yeah
D	he comes in the kitchen when I'm washing up look what I've made
E	I know
D	oh that's very good
E	I think he's the same
E	but I don't know whether that's like first child or just personalities I think it's probably personalities
D	yeah
E	cos
D	is quite different
E	different
D	yeah yeah
E	you know I mean we
E	ah
D	is he in Spain? is he okay?
E	yeah he's fine he's fine
D	course he is
E	but I I emailed I messaged text messaged and I facebooked
D	I'm fine
E	he was going to meet a girl that he's never met before
D	yeah
E	and a family
D	somewhere he's never been
E	that he's never met no
D	yeah is he staying with her family?
E	I think so
E	I've just about got the flight details off him as he was as
D	yeah
E	in the car
D	he's definitely a
E	erm but I said I've got no knowledge where you're going or anything I know you're twenty-four but if anything happens how are we gonna find you?
D	how are we meant to know? yeah
E	exactly
D	it could be like two weeks later
E	I know so erm
D	he's definitely a he doesn't always think things
E	no
D	yeah yeah we were
E	and you're kind of like
E	oh I know are you similar to
D	he's very different like that
E	yeah
D	I'm I consider myself normal
E	no
E	yeah
D	but I can't compete with
E	no I know
D	but that's fine
E	he he's very
D	it's
E	at least you know when you go when you go travelling and everything you know
D	it's all taken care of
E	yeah you know you have no worries
D	I mean
E	god
D	yeah I know sometimes think
E	just enjoy the moment
D	it's when he wants me to make a decision about something
E	yeah
D	and I'm like er I don't I don't know and he's like come on please just make a decision
D	but no
D	it's easier yeah
E	we've got so much kind of like erm
D	mm
E	that it's kind of like you just kind of get caught up in the moment and the enthusiasm
D	 asm yeah that's a great idea
E	yeah
E	yeah I mean look at the adventures you've had
D	yeah I mean there has been
E	yeah
D	some from er from Korea
E	do you miss it at all? do you miss Korea?

D	it's the only time his mum shaved his head
D	and he just looks like a real bruiser even though he's four he's actually really erm very quite docile and sweet
E	when we did that with er
D	yeah yeah they do they look like little hooligans
E	yeah
D	so
E	real fast friends

E	no he doesn't
[ANNOTATION]	Someone uses a lot of heavy-cream.	Contradiction

E	right you be careful please oh you got a wobbly table
D	oh yeah it's really wobbly
E	does it need tightening or something?
D	I don't know
E	oh and you know why? this is broken
D	broken yeah
E	okay
D	that's no good
D	does this not did this not come from you?
E	no
D	oh okay it must have been from
E	no
D	bit higgledy piggledy
E	er right
D	make will
E	he might do although we stopped and got a Costa Coffee cos he was yawning his head off
D	ah
E	we went to erm
D	ah seven
E	and he was doing BBQ
D	ah
E	and erm erm she did it lovely she set it all out in pirate theme and sandpit and paddling pool and
D	oh wow
E	and it was it was yeah it was really nice and er
D	well the weather was good yesterday
E	and then wine and wine and
E	I know
D	and pace yourself
E	I can't drink during the day at all
D	no makes you go
E	I'm just I'm just constantly
D	fall asleep
E	I'm just peak too early
D	yeah that's my mum you can tell even er even with a meal if she has half a lager
E	really?
D	she's not so bad in the evening
E	yeah no I'm the same
D	she's quite good with wine of an evening
E	I'm the same in the evening
D	but erm
E	but he erm and then of course when we got we got home about
E	so this morning he was a bit like my head you know?
E	and yawning all the way down here so
D	ah
E	he said do you mind if I quickly grab a coffee? I said no that's fine I was thinking not that's not fine I want to get there I want to get there
D	yeah yeah of course it's okay
E	and then as we came off the motorway the traffic was quite heavy going on and he went oh no and I went oh no
E	had to stop
D	had one before we left the house
E	but I was busting for the loo anyway so
D	oh that's okay
E	and as it was we didn't leave until twenty to ten so we didn't make too bad time
D	yeah that isn't too bad yeah and when we looked online
E	about two and a quarter hours
D	and I think you I think where my parents come down and you come down everyone comes down the same stretch and the thing is everything slows down when you get to that point
E	yeah
D	I think it says it's only twenty miles left or something but it still takes another forty minutes or something
E	yeah
D	yeah yeah oh yeah
E	yeah I don't know what's going on but there's motorbikes and mopeds and scooters everywhere like
D	oh really?
E	whether there's a big convention or something going on
D	oh maybe maybe there's a lot of stuff that goes on along the coast
E	yeah
D	but yeah
E	really?
D	it's really close yeah
E	do you like the sea?
D	yeah yeah love it it's been really nice there's
A	I see a picture of a
E	yeah
D	just on our own we've
E	yeah
D	so it is it's instantly relaxing
E	cos it kind of makes you feel then that we're not actually in England
D	yeah yeah yeah could be anywhere
E	well we kind of well we are but yeah
D	yeah
E	yeah
D	and there's quite and this area's quite nice and stuff so we'll get like a nice wholesome kind of
E	that's good
D	British experience while we're here
E	yeah so you haven't found it kind of like
D	yeah
E	than
D	I'd say so yeah
E	oh goodness
D	rather than
E	yeah
D	yeah
E	but then go to a lot of
D	Korea's pretty congested too
E	I was gonna say in like China and places like that
D	yeah yeah yeah
E	would be as well wouldn't they?
D	pollution's not a problem no yeah that's not
E	yeah
D	actually it's
E	are they?
D	so yeah and Brighton's a green city so there's a lot of recycling and rubbish bins and everything we're looking at him
E	that's good
D	yeah yeah a better idea
E	put put that on there
D	how does the er
E	wow
D	such a baker
E	I'm impressed
D	yeah I mean he's not a baker he just likes cooking doesn't he? but he's better at he's better at cooking and baking than I am it would of turned out worse if I'd tried
[ANNOTATION]	He is trying to do all the recipes in that Julie book.	Neutral
E	that's really good
D	it's just a fact
E	right you sit here then darling
D	how does erm
E	no
D	I was asking
E	well he's their uncle
D	yeah so does he?
E	but when we talk about it we kind of say well they're your
[ANNOTATION]	Brighton was declared the nicest coastal city in Britain in 2013.	Neutral
D	yeah
E	is that how it works?
D	yeah nieces yeah
E	it's all very Jeremy Kyle isn't it?
D	yeah yeah it's the same when I was
E	yeah
D	and they they were considerably older than me
E	it's strange isn't it?
D	so as a child I knew
[ANNOTATION]	There are many recycling stations in Brighton.	Entailment
E	no I think he
D	and I never saw them too often maybe as well
E	yeah
D	ah does he?
E	I think he will just think of them as cousins
[ANNOTATION]	Their parents have many friends who call themselves cousins.	Neutral
D	yeah I think so
E	I think it'll be that way
D	yeah it's irrelevant really
E	yeah
D	what the title is I suppose
E	yeah
D	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker D was the youngest.	Entailment
E	but erm
D	I just wondered if he er did I don't know I don't remember I need to ask my parents what did I actually call them anything or just by their names
E	yeah
D	mm
E	whether he kind of like says oh I'm your uncle or whatever
E	I don't know
D	yeah
E	are you having a drink?
D	but then again like big families I know like lots of Indians and things like that they they always talk about their cousins or their nieces or their nephews and they have such big families that they can all be around each other's ages and stuff
E	yeah
D	oh god no never you look far too young
D	my mum didn't
E	really?
D	yeah she didn't believe it at all
E	ah brilliant
D	so yeah that's always good to know
E	yeah definitely
D	will
E	er I've brought some sparkling water he might have some of that in a minute so are you having a drink at all?
D	have some of that
E	actually

E	erm
A	yeah

E	ah would you
E	thank you
E	sit down
D	especially er
E	yes
D	this is definitely stronger
E	oh god yeah I was trying to get my head round erm
D	oh right yeah
E	but I ended up I think getting like an espresso with milk with it and it was like oh my god this is too strong
D	yeah
E	they do their oh I don't even know what
D	it's all about espressos and stuff like that
E	it is
D	yeah
E	I was gonna say they will be they'll be absolutely buzzing
D	cigarettes and espressos
E	I don't know if you want to put them in the erm
D	oh in the fridge

E	just like sorting everything out?
D	everything out yeah yeah
E	kind of like seeing your home come together a little bit
E	shush
E	yeah
D	I guess now that you've brought up the bed and desk that's like the final
E	that's probably it now isn't it?
D	yeah
E	yeah
D	so after this weekend I guess this evening and tomorrow I'll rearrange and
E	sort it all properly
D	and then it's been really nice having the three weeks before we start our university course
E	when do you start?
D	we have to go in on Friday for our first
E	right
D	and then in the afternoon I think we have a subject specific
E	drinks and nibbles
D	drinks and nibbles yeah I hope so
D	I'm there
D	but erm
E	are you feeling daunted at all? or
D	good
E	yeah you've really gotten to grips with it quickly haven't you?
D	yeah trying to there's just so much it's seems never ending
E	yeah
D	like certain chapters in books because at the moment we're reading just generally which is a bit overwhelming cos we don't really know what we're focusing on as much
E	can you take it? I've I've just like
D	no no no I can't
E	yeah
D	like keeping references and quotes and then when it comes to it I'll go back over those notes that I've made
E	yeah
D	and that'll hopefully I'll hopefully have all the key ideas ideas in there but when it comes to some like complex ideas that we have to like comprehend I have to like re-read the the sentence or the paragraph a couple of times because all of the terminology is different and the language and stuff
E	mm
D	so it is difficult yeah
E	oh gosh
D	it's not easy
E	if you need erm let me know when you run short of pads and things like that
D	oh yeah cos you can get them easily as well
E	cos working in an office I can
D	oh really?
E	well I'll try anyway
E	just gimme a shout
D	oh my goodness
D	anything
E	and if I can I will do so
D	brilliant yeah

D	yeah I know scones scones you say them
A	huh?
D	did you find the tablet?
B	I'll ask
D	what?
E	that had the instructions for the bed in it didn't it? and
B	it had the instructions for the bed in it apparently
E	and screws and things
B	did we throw that out or has it gone?
D	oh
B	what happened to it?
D	yeah it went
B	ah
D	you said it wasn't your stuff you didn't know what it was
[ANNOTATION]	The instructions were in many languages.	Neutral
B	I didn't know what it
D	oh
B	it looked like a dusty old box with just some nothing in it
E	did you not see the instructions in it?
B	no I didn't look in it I just
D	no
B	I didn't know you chucked it away
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B didn't take a look into the box.	Entailment
D	oh careful with the guitar darling oh
E	put it down please
D	is it is it how crucial is it? is it
E	right come on out now please? you don't need to go under there
D	so were you just keeping this bed in your garage?
E	yeah
D	ah
E	yeah
D	waiting for an occasion
E	yeah when we bought it originally erm
D	oh yeah yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Someone carries a violin.	Contradiction
E	don't get in the way will you? just
D	oh I forgot I forgot he moved out of home for a little while
E	yeah yeah for a little while so
D	mm
[ANNOTATION]	The guitar is an electric one.	Neutral
E	you know where they sell stuff
D	mm yeah
E	but then he never took the bed cos he didn't have space
E	so we've just had it staying in there
D	staying in there ah
E	and
D	he's never coming back don't do it
D	no
E	I mean I'm sure like your parents I'm hopeful that you guys will stay a bit closer but I don't think it's going to happen is it?
D	I I I know
[ANNOTATION]	The bed was a single one.	Neutral
E	yeah
D	which we haven't ruled out at all
E	I'm gonna push this to so we can
E	I know
D	no not really
E	you're just ready for the next challenge
D	when we've been after that year of travelling it was nice to
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker D has travelled recently.	Entailment
E	yeah
D	I could of stayed at home for longer I think just because of the security after travelling for so long
E	yeah
D	so yeah
E	I think there was one point that
D	yeah definitely
E	mm
D	it does get tiring get tired of the way that people treat foreign er cheap tourists and stuff like that
E	yeah
D	so it can be tiring but
E	and then and then if you've got your own stresses of
D	we wouldn't change it for anything
E	of looking for the next place or where you were going or where you're gonna stay
D	mm
E	and if you're tired or whatever then then that's when it kind of clashes doesn't it?
D	yeah yeah yeah friction
E	I don't wanna stay any more
D	the shouting
E	oh no
D	so er
E	and not smoking as well
D	and but like we'd walk away but we'd only go as far away as the street end because neither of us wanted to actually go out of sight of the other one
E	yeah
D	cos you're in foreign country so we kind of stand there and like frown for a moment and then come back together and like kiss and make up
D	maybe smoke a cigarette
E	yeah
D	yeah cos that's another thing like as far as er couples go there's we've spent a lot of time together
E	if you can cope with all of that you can cope with anything
D	yeah yeah exactly it has definitely made us stronger I think
E	I really think so
D	yeah we're definitely on the other side of that
E	yeah that's brilliant
D	so that's nice
E	I well I just think it I I just think if you're thrown together and doing all that travelling and
D	yeah
E	coming home and setting up home it's like it's not
B	yeah
D	it's not yeah it's not as bad as
E	you know
B	still stressful
E	yeah
D	course it's stressful
E	well you've also got the amount of money it's costing you and stuff haven't you?
D	but
B	studying
E	yeah
B	no not at all
D	no yeah that's the breeziest part
E	that's behind you
A	mm
D	is she a pretty lady?
E	do you need the toilet?
D	no
A	no
E	are you sure?
A	no
[ANNOTATION]	The toilet is the ladies room.	Neutral
E	okay
B	is that what I can smell?
E	is that your bottom?
B	oh bloody hell
E	or is that
B	I hope that's you and not
E	you'll be rushing out of the room won't you if it's
A	that's not me
E	are you sure?
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B can smell something.	Entailment
A	yeah
E	okay
A	they're still the same
E	yeah
B	are we gonna go to the park later?
D	from Japan or something
A	yeah
B	cool
D	well hopefully the sun'll come back through it was like glorious earlier
B	it's coming out a bit now yeah
E	we could saw the sea didn't we? as we were coming down in the car
[ANNOTATION]	The sun was bright earlier today.	Entailment
D	oh you did?
B	sea's only fifteen minutes down the hill
D	yeah it's not far
E	yeah we'll just go to the park that's okay a bit later on won't we?
D	stretch the legs
B	if you're happy to eat just round the corner there's a place
E	is it nice there?
B	erm it's nice enough
[ANNOTATION]	Sea is not far away from current location.	Entailment
D	yeah
B	it's a pub
D	yeah we've eaten there
E	yeah that's fine it's a celebratory meal isn't it?
A	so
D	yeah yeah
E	yeah
B	next time you come up we'll erm
E	well no leave it on your figure
E	don't
[ANNOTATION]	The pub closes at 9 o'clock.	Neutral
D	I change hands and play with it all the time it's really nice
E	ah it's lovely
B	ah ah
D	it's just the different shades that run through it
B	right let me finish this and then I'll play with you alright?
D	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B is playing alone now.	Entailment
E	were you surprised? were you shocked?
D	yeah oh yeah definitely bless him going like because it was towards the end of our holiday and bless him for carrying that around with him and the thought of proposing the entire trip
E	I know
D	yeah yeah he kept putting it off
E	I haven't heard anything it was getting towards the end of your holiday yeah
D	yeah
E	yeah
D	wasn't paying attention and
E	is that what
D	picture yeah
E	did you notice any change in
D	no no I didn't notice it before then but when he actually proposed I've never seen
E	was he?
D	he was like shaking
E	was
D	he was stumbling over his words I've never seen him like that it was so sweet
E	oh that's lovely
D	it was lovely and I went in for this like moment of like quietness and shock and like
E	yeah
D	and I don't really remember any of it any more cos I was kinda just in this daze and got a bit tearful it was just very romantic
E	yeah
D	and it was nice that
E	yeah
D	I think
E	yeah
D	as well so
E	yeah
D	yeah he picked he picked a good spot
E	I mean when he he said mum what do you think? this is what I want to say
D	ah
E	and I was in tears
D	I know
E	I just think it's so beautiful
D	afterwards
E	yeah
D	and then I think she showed my auntie and cried and it was all very nice so
E	it's something that you can look at again and
D	yeah
E	just read and think gosh I can't believe you said to me you know
D	mm
E	ah it's lovely
E	yeah yeah
D	so he waited again picked the perfect moment on our hike when there was like nobody at the guest house in the mountains and stuff and then pulled out this poem that he made
E	but don't you think that means so much more than a present?
D	hell yeah definitely
E	than going into a shop and buying something
D	of course yeah
E	like those special moments
D	definitely
E	are what it's all about
D	and then again it's something you can keep well especially now since everything's digital
E	yeah
D	so I've got a digital copy
E	I've got a few poems that I've got
D	so
E	in in my scrapbook at home
D	I keep wanting to I tried doing it for my mum and stuff around mother's day or her birthday but mine are never as good as
E	oh I know
D	ah you found my hot
E	have you got blankets and things?
D	yeah we do have some blankets we've got a couple of the ones that are in the sofa I've got a couple more of those and
E	yeah
D	I've got some extra duvets
E	so what heating have you got? what heating have you got in here?
D	just the storage heaters
E	oh okay
D	now there's only two there's one in each room
E	oh okay
D	and that type of thing so I think it might be cheaper at night
E	so like a super saver and a yeah
D	yeah and then maybe even more or less at the weekend I'm not sure
E	oh okay
D	but erm the idea is
E	it certainly sounds it
E	okay
D	but
E	yeah
D	typically we'd be going to uni more and stuff but we've been cooking lunch and
E	yeah
D	no yeah that's true yeah
E	could be in the like evenings are a little bit lighter to a certain
D	yeah
B	gonna ask the missus
D	yeah
B	if we have it in the corner in the back window you're not gonna be able to open the draw out because the bay window's like that
C	if you push
B	and I think you've just got just as much space under the bed without the drawers
D	yeah
C	if you push the bed back into towards the window you're gonna get enough room to get the drawers out
D	get the drawers out
B	we'll just do that?
D	yeah
E	is that where you want them though?
D	are you gonna be okay keeping the drawers?
E	yeah yeah we'll just take it take it away
D	I don't wanna give you more of our stuff to
E	is that where you wanted the bed there
B	well we haven't decided yet but we were thinking
C	it would work if the bed was outside you could have one side that could be the drawer but then
E	if you had it that side
D	oh right yeah cos of the other
E	you've got it near the window when you wake up haven't you?
B	yeah but the problem with the window is we have a streetlight there and it's extremely bright
E	oh okay
B	and I already struggle sleeping in here it's why these curtains look so bad is I've actually hooked up two curtains
E	oh okay yeah
B	to kind of keep it dark
B	so I was thinking if the head was in here then I'm not looking at the window
E	that's true
B	I'm looking at the darkness of the room rather than at the bright window so
E	that's true
D	yeah I mean I don't it looks perfectly fine as it is it's a nice bed
B	I mean we can swap stuff underneath
D	yeah absolutely
C	and it will go back
B	and then we stick it in the corner
D	yeah
B	I mean we can rearrange it at another time but
E	yeah
B	drawers or no drawers it's still the same amount of storage isn't it? you can just
D	oh yeah yeah it can go underneath there
B	maybe even a bit more storage
C	you can get some low boxes can't you?
D	oh yeah yeah
E	yeah
D	put the weights and stuff under there that sort of thing all your CDs there piled in that corner
E	yeah yeah
D	I've been missing
C	what shall we shall we just take these back then?
E	we'll take the drawers back then yeah
B	do you mind?
C	what are you doing?
E	no not at all
B	oh you're too heavy mate if you sit on that I can't possibly move it back
D	it's a nice frame thank you guys really that's a massive thing to load up here
D	yeah
C	we can take this back yeah
D	just a reminder
B	I mean do you want us to hang onto that? so
C	no no
E	no no
C	you haven't got no storage I'd I'd say I'd just use it as firewood for the winter
B	yeah
D	okay
A	are you going to carry this?
E	no
C	no but back though
E	no
D	yeah
D	I was thinking there might be noticeable hinges or things but there's not at all is there?
C	nice fit
B	it's nice
D	ah yeah perfect
C	you've still got room there for your drinks
D	ah yeah thank you that's a really cool bed actually it's a little bit of style to it
D	yeah
E	you've got shoes on off now
E	off
D	so we'll just do some rearranging later tonight
D	now we've actually got a proper bed
C	go in there
D	yeah I think exactly where it will go
B	yeah
E	let's go and get Connect Four out shall we?
D	it's quite yeah it's a good size
A	Connect Four
B	have you got Connect Four
B	that's quite cool
E	oh you've got a printer that's good
D	didn't take you too long to put together thank you men
B	yeah
D	men with their tools
C	no I loved it I put it I put it together a few months back
C	to go through it all with myself
B	shall we get this into the car later or do you want to take it down there now?
C	no without a doubt that can stay there now cos I'm not gonna put it on the roof
B	do you want some cream tea then?
D	yeah you can slide it in the back
C	just gonna slide it in the back
E	do you want to get changed?
D	yeah do you want some scones and whatnot?
A	a whistle
D	ah now you can whistle
D	does he play for a local does he play for a little team?
E	yeah yeah
D	he does? oh
E	yeah
B	he's good at tennis
E	sorry we never carried on about the proposal and everything we got quite sidetracked didn't we?
D	oh yeah
C	that's it
D	oh yeah yeah
E	so you're walking along
D	yes yeah
E	and suddenly he what?
D	he said he just did the classic thing to his brother and said er can you take a photo of us here?
D	and he was so
E	so you turned round did you or?
D	yeah so we always have the
E	yeah
D	and then it was one of the only places I think where there were no people around at that particular moment and it was a sunny day cos we were there in the rainy season and there were all these flowers and things
E	beautiful
D	and then he just started saying
E	did you kind of look at him and think what's going on?
D	what's going on and then he got his backpack and actually a few days later cos it was the rainy season we kept taking our erm
B	why don't you get that out?
D	why don't you use it? and I thought he was being a bit geeky or something
D	yeah yeah I was just like oh my god I don't know what I was thinking I don't know what I was thinking I was just surprised
B	do you like scones and cream and that kind of stuff?
C	I do
B	yeah?
E	and then did you did you come out and say everything you wanted to say in the right way or did it kind of like get all mixed up or?
B	I don't I don't really remember
D	I think so but yeah neither of us were
D	and then he took his hat off and got down on one knee which was good
E	and did you kind of like
D	yeah
B	yeah
D	so it was really nice yeah
E	ah
D	it was really nice and we've got it all on camera and stuff
A	why not mummy?
D	no I know
E	yeah
D	yeah yeah
E	but it's nice to have that lovely moment together
D	it is yeah
E	yeah
D	and the acceptance of it as well
E	yeah
D	it got me very emotional
E	ah lovely
E	right what darling?
B	but the actual oven itself
E	right well come up to the table a minute then I'm just having my coffee
D	do you want your own table
E	yeah that's better let's pull that out
D	there we go
B	and obviously the washing machine's ours we had to get that in
D	are you very good at Connect Four?
A	yeah
D	can I give you one of these?
E	the table it's wobbly
D	no?
B	no no no it's been wobbly for ages this is dad's table
E	yeah but I'm just thinking that
C	that's just a wedge isn't it?
B	yeah
C	just hammer it through don't you?
B	dad's just
E	no
B	the problem is this wedge doesn't go properly through but I don't think even if you put it properly through it's gonna stop it from being wobbly I think it will still just be wobbly
D	I dunno if that's what's causing
B	I think it will still be wobbly even if that's wedged in
C	that's not wobbling from the wedge is it? it's wobbling from the top
D	yeah
E	take my drink off
D	yeah
B	don't worry though mum we're used to it
E	yeah I know but
B	it might be I mean the wedge isn't quite going through on this side
D	yes
E	then we might as well do it
C	yeah
D	no no way?
E	yeah
D	from scratch?
E	forgotten he'd made it but yeah
D	ah brilliant
B	you made that?
D	as
D	no no
E	and you can't change anything or do anything can you?
D	so it's a little bit strange having the responsibility of an actual
E	yeah
B	say cheese
A	cheese
B	shall we have some cream tea then? do you want a coffee
C	erm
B	cream tea
E	cream tea
B	shall we move it out?
C	I could fix it but I haven't got the time or the tools to fix it
E	oh okay maybe next time then
B	what do I need to do? just screw it in?
C	what I'd do you see the batons that it's got there?
B	yeah
C	I'll probably get another one for this side and then screw it tight into there and tight into there
B	stop it from wobbling
C	but obviously obviously got to work out the length of the screws so it doesn't pop through the top
B	yeah yeah yeah yeah
C	and just get a screw that'll finish half way
A	mummy
C	and then that should stop it
A	mummy
B	I'll see if I can be bothered
E	yeah
A	mummy
E	if not wedge something underneath it or something
A	mummy
C	well no it's from here it's doing it

C	not really
B	it's not like a full time job or anything it's actually surprisingly hard to record people
E	you think at the beginning don't you oh this is gonna be easy
A	what are they all yours?
C	they're my pawns
E	yeah
D	yeah you can
E	you can say that's
B	but I mean I I mean they say it's unlimited but I'd feel a bit odd if it was just twenty hours of the two of us
E	yeah
D	if we get desperate enough we'll have to record
E	yeah
D	but yeah I feel bad
E	so you've sent your first lot off?
[ANNOTATION]	person E don't know he sent lot off or not	Neutral

E	you just have to outwardly say to people that
C	they're on the floor you knocked them on the floor
D	yeah
E	it's not really
D	yeah probably
A	I've got yours dad
E	no no no
D	no yeah definitely

D	I think so
E	we've got one at home that erm
A	on their first go
E	his dad made an actual table over the top of it
E	in the lounge where the lights lamp sits on that's a chess table
B	oh
E	all the little squares and things so we pull that out and played on it
D	who made it?
E	no
D	oh his dad ah
E	that's where
C	it's very good innit? to tap into that knowledge a bit
D	oh
E	well though you said
B	oh did he not?
C	no
E	so it's kind of he'd do the job and then say here you go I've done so it's not like okay come and help me show me how it it it worked
B	did he figure it out for himself or was he shown?
E	that's his trade wasn't it?
C	no he used to be a carpenter yeah
D	yeah that was yeah was that his trade
E	mm
C	and then he was a builder
E	what about his dad?
C	his dad was a builder as well I think
E	but you actually messaged him the other day didn't you? cos we were just outside the garage and we want to get rid of all that rubbish and flatten it and have a erm patio and stuff there
D	mm
B	yeah
E	so
B	what the garage are you gonna flatten it?
E	no not the garage I've got a door you know you've got a door that locks we've got a window now in there

E	yeah
E	we got the window for free didn't we? off Ebay
C	yeah
E	well it was one pound and a penny or something like that four pence
C	around four pence it was
D	oh wow
E	and we gave it to the lady
E	and I think it's because you said
C	I said
E	yeah so she said oh no have it take it for an ice cream
B	and it was just a pound?
C	yeah so she gave the pound back to us
E	and
D	a couple of quid
E	so it didn't cost us anything
C	beautiful window
E	decent window
A	mm mm
E	you've done a good job putting it in
B	why would you even sell it for a pound? you might as well just give it away
C	well I bid a tenner
E	well I've
C	I did bid a tenner yeah
E	yeah and I think she'd sold some previously for about twenty pounds or something
C	yeah she had three windows and they went for sort of twenty or thirty quid
B	ah but that one went for
E	well we were lucky
E	it's good innit?
D	just keep getting
E	yeah and give give the er child kind of like
D	yeah
B	she's probably thinking that poor tyke doesn't even have a window on his house
E	yeah
E	I think she was thinking god your parents have raided your money box to come and pay for this window
E	have the money back
A	are these shepherds?
C	bishops
A	bishops
E	you know silly money
D	ah
E	and
C	he only got some with blue squares
E	so he said right and he was saying about it and I said well ask your dad
C	where can he go? where can he move to?
E	so it's about how you made the slabs and how to do this drainage or something so
B	have you showed him castling?
C	well done
B	nice that was good
C	well done
E	yeah
D	yeah next summer
E	yeah
D	making something else
E	hope so
B	how many times have you beaten your dad then
D	yeah
E	yeah
C	yeah
D	you looking forward to it? or
C	can't wait
D	oh can't wait okay
C	that one or that one
B	they had a bit of a falling out
D	must be tiring
E	yeah
B	resentments
E	yeah a little bit
D	okay
E	kind of not being treated as fairly
C	they were a bit naughty I think
E	yeah
B	kind of screwed them over on the money
E	that ended up got getting discussed yesterday at
C	everybody supported me didn't they?
B	well you were in the right
C	I think so yeah
D	big debate
E	and then you know
B	well that's the fundamental difference between a tribute band and a
E	yeah
B	and a
E	totally
C	absolutely we were in it to make the money
E	like like yeah
D	yeah yeah yeah
C	putting them their own music out there
B	you're a tribute band you're you're a business
D	and also your your priorities are completely different to a twenty-one year old
E	yeah that's what I said I said
C	well there's that as well yeah
E	and the reason he went into the band was to make some extra money
D	yeah yeah
E	and to use the talent that he's got so
D	cos when you're when you're young and in bands people do take advantage of you
E	yeah
D	in pubs and stuff they'll pay as little as they can
B	yeah
E	yeah
B	yeah
E	they really do don't they?
B	pay you in some free beer or something
D	yeah exactly
E	and you don't care do you? cos you just think
D	students or whatever
E	you're playing your music you're getting it out there
D	yeah
E	yeah living the dream as he keeps saying
C	that's it
E	but I mean they have they've toured in quite a few different places
B	where did these beers come from?
D	I know
E	oh we bought them we bought them with us
D	ridiculous
B	no
E	and some oranges
D	and some grapes which we ran out of this morning
E	you know what I
E	I go round the cupboards thinking
E	I don't need that I don't need that that's not going to be used oh
D	that's nice it's always a surprise whenever you
B	please let us get dinner then?
E	will you please?
B	I want to like you brought us enough stuff
E	well tough
B	mum I'll do that for sure
E	you've got enough expense with you know living here and
C	it's your go
B	well so have you
E	please
D	you'll make her mad
E	just let us enjoy the treat
E	I used to be the same with my mum
D	yeah
E	don't
D	it doesn't work
E	yeah
D	so I said last time when they come up Monday I said I'm really sorry you know next time we'll cook for you and my mum was like well
E	exactly
D	so
E	I think you I think you guys have just gotta say oh great mum and dad or whatever are coming up they're gonna take us out
D	no yeah yeah
C	no you can't jump
D	we
E	yeah
E	he just oozes this kind of like for me kind of gives me wraps a blanket around me and makes me feel kind of like everything's okay
D	yeah yeah

B	just not used to
C	I didn't jump anybody
A	he didn't jump
C	want to move you bishop which is there
B	yeah it has
D	the assurance
E	it's that kind of yeah the feeling
D	yeah
B	yeah
E	I know yeah
D	he got he got back in contact
B	yeah straightaway
E	but it was nice what you kind of said to him and it just made me feel like ah at least one of my sons is
D	cares
E	cares yeah exactly
D	or it's the thinking of you I'm sure
E	I think you just said er hey
B	she's almost in tears or something
E	erm yeah
B	he did straightaway after that didn't he?
E	I know and like
B	within an hour or something
E	how come he responded to that and didn't respond? and I said well he did say he hadn't got any internet access but I'm not so sure
D	ah
E	it's kind of he just goes into his own world
D	mm mm yeah yeah yeah
B	yeah
D	I mean we definitely experienced that a little bit
C	he's just spent the last six months contacting her by the internet ain't he? so I guess she is she's got a
D	yeah
E	exactly that's what
D	yeah
B	yeah
B	of course he had internet he's been on on the internet to her all the time
E	I know
B	woah
C	you wish it was checkmate
E	I don't remember it
D	maybe you used to like two days
C	that would have been checkmate
D	but that's only
E	you've always been more considerate you've always been more thoughtful in that way whether it's living on your own earlier and growing up a bit quicker I don't know I don't know
D	just personality
E	yeah it is as well
B	yeah
D	he didn't think we were waiting for him
B	we're just sitting there waiting for
E	I'm I'm always kind of like
B	he he thinks about himself more
E	yeah he's more yeah he is
D	not in a selfish way though
B	I guess he's
D	yeah yeah
E	but it's like that other connection like mum doesn't know I'm fine it's like you know just connect the two together
B	no I know
D	there is like a weaker connection somewhere
E	yeah
B	ah
E	and I did joke he knows what he's like
D	yeah
E	cos I did say it to him well how are we going to communicate when you go to uni then? because you don't even answer my text messages now when you're at home it's like
C	you'll take my pawns
D	that's true
E	I said is email gonna be the best option for you? you know
D	yeah you're not going to hear from him for a while
E	okay some advice how often do I contact?
B	when he's at uni?
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about a email	Entailment
E	yeah
B	oh
E	yeah but will he then think that I don't care about him?

E	I know girls in relationships are a bit
A	is it check?
C	it is yeah I could take your king

E	I think I just have to go as long as I can won't I?
D	yeah
E	and see
A	how may how how can you take the queen?
C	no you can't
A	how?
B	once a month is fine
E	what about visiting?
B	I mean you should be you should be organising to see him once every three months
[ANNOTATION]	person B is organizing to see every there month	Neutral
E	yeah once every three months okay
B	or six months what do you think?
C	you only lose one space remember
E	well I don't know
[ANNOTATION]	they are not sure about time	Entailment
C	that's it well done
B	when we were at uni how often did we see me and mum?
E	I know
B	once a
E	no
B	it was probably about twice a year
E	it was more than that
B	you you'd come down once and I'd come home once
D	I guess
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about weather	Contradiction
E	no
B	how often did I go home?
E	I'm sure that it was more than twice a year
B	no I travelled in the summer so I wasn't around then
D	maybe two maybe three times a year?
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about travel in the summer	Neutral
E	yeah
B	so we saw each other three times a year
D	I don't know
B	so that's once every four months then
E	maybe
B	we may have emailed or like
E	yeah
D	I guess it's only like three months until Christmas then
E	oh we'll have to go down and visit cos we won't see where he's living and that
D	erm yeah yeah
E	so I don't want it I don't I want to see where he's living and all of that I don't want him to think that
B	I wanna see where he's living too
D	he's living in the same halls as
B	yeah that's a bit random yeah
E	oh really?
D	exactly the same er
E	is it nice?
B	it's not the same building
D	yeah she said er yeah she's in a flat he's in a house
B	she's in a flat he's in a house
D	but she said it was really nice
E	I've seen where it is and it's kind of like right at the back of the uni so it's kind of like
D	yeah
E	yeah it looked lovely so
D	yeah and Canterbury itself is quite nice
E	my concern is he's gonna get so embroiled with this girl that he's gonna miss out on that connection of making friends and joining in and all of that
D	socialising
B	yeah I told him that I said you
E	well that's what I said I said
E	I said why are you complicating your life when you're just about to start on a new adventure? you're going to uni and you have to be focused
B	I'm wondering if he's gonna come back and that it'll be the end of it and he'll be like
E	yeah
D	make the most of it before he
E	he did kind of say something like you know well
E	and I said yeah but if you really really like her you'll end up hurting her

E	and it's like
B	it's better to have a piece of something than to have none of it at all
E	well I hope she sees it the same way
D	yeah

B	well it's not that hard for a Spaniard to get over to England
E	no
B	I mean they're part of the EU it's not like she's going for a green card or anything
E	no
B	so she can live here all she wants
D	going out to visit her does sort of open up the invitation a little bit more it's not exactly cutting things off
E	no
B	no no I don't know why he did that
E	yeah
B	I told him to end it
