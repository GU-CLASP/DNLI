D	I dislike the
B	no protein porridge
E	I have porridge with Nutella cos someone at uni ate my Nutella
B	I have that whey powder in there
A	I haven't had porridge in ages
E	and I haven't worked out who it is yet they ate like a kilo
B	who?
D	next time buy Nutella and put loads of laxatives in it and then you'll know who did it
E	no no because then I can't eat it someone at my flat
D	yeah but it's not there for you to eat it's there for you to punish the person who eats your food
C	yeah
B	yeah have your own thing just take it with it but pretend the one in there is the one you always eat
E	but I just cos it was a gift from my mother from France
D	how dare you eat my Nutella from France
E	it tastes different
D	does it? how does it?
E	yeah
B	it does
E	it does and it was a kilo jar that's a lot so someone deliberately tried to like eat it like if you were just going to use a little bit every now and then once it got to a certain point you'd be like okay she's going to start to notice I'll stop using it
C	yeah
E	and they obviously were trying to
C	they had like the whole thing
E	I think it was
D	it's the problem with university is that all obviously all the students have just come from living in their own house
E	mm
D	they haven't realised that it's different can't just like go in the fridge
E	well quite a lot of us share our food like the four of us girls in our flat who get on really well we erm we share
D	there's a real weird thing coming in
B	no come in do do it get your two knuckles get your two knuckles and like
E	we share like milk and eggs and erm like and everything
C	I don't know if I'd be able to like share food cos I I'm really like really obsessive with my
E	well we only share the stuff that like it would be silly like cos you know cos first week of uni we had six bottles of milk in the fridge
C	just like the plain things and stuff
D	cos everyone bought milk
E	yeah and what's the point? you know and everyone has their like own bread but like eggs we'll just get a set of like twelve
C	yeah I guess I guess those things
E	cos it just doesn't make sense and and cos we're all quite close if someone's like oh can I I've erm run out of bread can I just borrow a slice of your bread we'd be like yeah that's fine but we always ask each other we don't just like yeah
C	mm?
C	oh

D	oh quality of the semi
B	I hate Beats
D	they're not even that good
B	they're so over yeah so over
D	they're just over branded and over priced because people buy them
B	it's because of will.i.am
C	oh the
D	yeah I mean they they're probably already but the frequency response won't be great so
E	I erm my uncle bought me and my brother those fake Beats
D	fake Beats
E	from China and the you know you could tell that they were fake cos if you looked in the small print on the box there are all like spelling and grammar mistakes because that's what they do to warn like copyright
