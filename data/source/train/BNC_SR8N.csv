A	sorry about that
A	um
B	yeah he sort of ignored didn't he?
A	I text him saying Not speaking like? And then he said so then he text us back and then he just said Oh I thought I'd ring you
B	what's he been doing then? He he described himself as a busy bee?
A	he said he'd been very busy
B	it's supposed to be mayonnaise but I don't know how to make it
A	I don't know actually
B	first or?
A	no no I think you you whisk the egg yolks for a long time and then you sort of
B	yeah that's what I was doing
A	and then you sort of drip the oil in
B	I've got six in there like uh
A	I can find I can
B	I've got six or d'you think there's not gonna be enough?
A	no no that sounds like a lot
B	uh yeah yeah
A	anyway yes so then
B	yeah
A	he was telling me what he'd been doing
B	yeah
A	the plan is that
B	why? I mean he he what about like and presumably TE you know
A	so
B	yeah
A	um
B	right well that sounds very reasonable doesn't it?
A	but he's gonna be the one like he's gonna be the main carer I think
B	um yeah fair enough
A	but he likes kids doesn't he I mean?
B	so is
A	getting a job
B	yeah
A	she's like an administrator and he's like a general purpose dogsbody
B	well
A	does he?
B	well he has done
A	yeah but
B	that's his main qualification isn't it?
A	but
B	well he does have that qualification TE you know he's he's only got the qualification as a barman yeah
A	yeah he's a barman he's worked in a factory he's worked in a
B	he has experience as a bingo called
A	his work
B	A club um worked in a club as a barman
A	tE do you know what I mean he's just like
B	furniture salesman yeah
A	but he's more
B	yeah that that does allow you to sort of fit in uh I guess bring up a child around that
A	I suppose like my worry there is though that he would like if Sarah goes to work all day and he's looks after the baby all day then he goes to work all night like that's not gonna be very good for them two
B	oh yeah I think they they gonna have to work really hard and like um
A	no but I mean like their relationship
B	I don't
A	tE you know
B	uh well I mean
A	Cos he was like Oh we can't afford childcare
B	they're certainly don't don't they TE you know both have like spend part of their time with their own families don't they?
A	I think so
B	just uh
A	he's also been like doing odd jobs and he's been
B	is he still doing?
A	he said that's doing really well
B	oh right well it seems like he he's making quite a lot of money then?
A	well he always is but just never
B	tE do you think that he gets it and
A	he does
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about book	Contradiction
B	I'm assuming the child I mean how much time how much does it cost to raise a child like as cheap as
A	well
B	like why? Is it? Do people not do that?
A	well yes people do do that but
B	no I don't think it's disgusting to put a  to put a  scan
A	yeah but I don't dunno if I would wanna do it like
B	well that's rather a negative view I would've thought
A	I dunno I didn't really like the idea either
B	really?
A	I sort of understood
B	really? I think it's very interesting
A	you you don't even like Facebook at the best of times you wouldn't wanna
B	um? No I know I mean like you you could put that
A	I can't seem to find like the the the instructions
B	for mayonnaise?
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about party	Contradiction
A	anyway
B	have you not googled How to make mayonnaise?
A	yeah I've got I'm on the BBC Food one that I normally like
A	um
B	is that my one actually
[ANNOTATION]	they are not sure how can make mayuonnaise	Neutral
A	that's mine I've just opened that
A	anyway so
B	decided not to?
A	yeah
B	make it worse?
A	so okay here's Delia's recipe
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about school	Contradiction
B	okay
A	then holding your electric whisk in one hand
B	right
B	right it's just sort of whisked in
A	then it says However stupid this may sound the key to successful mayonnaise is make sure each drop of oil is thoroughly whisked in before adding the next drop
B	so could use uh
A	so you pour it you you pour it a drop at a time
B	yeah yeah
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about weather	Contradiction
A	and then
B	could use um
A	yeah? It
B	but uh wasn't sure like if that would like rip it up and?
A	no I it'll be fine
B	and um
A	oh and then I said erm have you thought of any? Are you staying with the same names? And they said he said Oh if it's a boy I'm still going to call him
B	fair enough
A	if it's a girl they're had a new idea and they're thinking of
B	oh right
A	but calling her
B	yeah I mean well I would have said you like there is a slight risk with with uh with rarer names
B	I think the rarer name can be a bit like be a bit of a stigma sometimes
A	but
B	yeah I think that's that's that's alright yeah
A	I was like Yeah
B	that's pretty um
A	so
B	that's that sounds good yeah
A	that's where that is
B	getting kind of thicker now
A	have you put any oil in?
B	yeah I have
A	but just do a drop
B	yeah I know
A	um
B	you've got to uh yeah like I guess you've got to uh yeah like I guess you've got to like whisk whip it for ages so that it um
A	do you want me to do some? Is your hand getting tired?
B	uh yeah yeah
A	and then?
B	so yeah
A	that's much better
B	I think it would
A	I know
B	if you had a name like
A	um
B	yeah yeah it's hard to raise a child if you've only got one bedroom
A	but he said he'll obviously have to just save up because they need to get
B	well he seems to be making quite a bit of money doesn't he?
A	well they need to get the new deposit before they get the old deposit back
B	you need to?
A	like we've got a
B	yeah
A	but if we wanted to move we'd have to find a new fifteen hundred pounds before we got the old one back
B	I see right
A	oh if you wanted to buy yeah
B	yeah
A	no I don't think he's in quite that state yet
A	then I was saying we were thinking of going to Sunderland like in September
B	yeah around that sort of time yeah
A	he said
B	I
A	once the baby had had chance to stop like being weird
B	if I can
A	do you want to put some?
B	um integrate that um
A	do you think?
B	I mean cos if you look at it obviously it's
A	no
B	um
A	yeah
B	just wonder how are they making the mayonnaise runny?
A	yeah
B	put them up
A	where we put in like gum Arabic was it?
B	ah you mean was that like uh How It How It's Made?
A	they put in
B	oh right
A	yeah um
B	yeah
A	she was asking about
B	oh right
A	and she was like
B	shall I do it? What are they?
A	like
B	oh right
A	not like a tight sort of fitting coat like more like a
B	yeah
A	anyway
B	yeah
A	and then she said she's gonna ring tomorrow for a proper chat I was like yay
A	do you wanna email? I can help you
B	that's right
A	if you wanna
B	actually should have put a bit of garlic in there
A	mm
B	just uh slipped a little bit there like
A	huh? Whoops
B	no it's
A	yeah
B	um
A	ooh quite boring
B	uh like and you were
A	do you want some of this?
B	you were
A	bit what?
B	it's a bit strong
A	oh I like it
B	not really in the mood for uh
A	mm it's nice
B	so I don't really know when to stop with this I'm just gonna keep on uh
A	until it looks like mayonnaise it's still a bit runny isn't it?
B	yeah
A	no but the that's alright
B	that's like the probably the main uh observation that I would make
A	but real mayonnaise is yellow like
B	yeah I could put a bit of mustard in maybe
A	hmm?
B	bit of mustard like might go nicely
A	oh yeah that'd be nice
B	um
A	whole grain
B	think so
A	and I said like something like um Is
B	she she can be a a tad um uh well she seems to have quite a few health well she seems to get quite a few health problems like
A	and
B	well yeah like you do
A	can I do it for a bit?
B	I've only just started
A	oh sorry
B	yeah yeah you have to be uh
A	and then I said Ah have you seen pictures of
B	oh did he yeah
A	and
B	he's getting  he's getting  very like like uh like
A	no that's
B	yeah
A	well I just thought like
B	he doesn't like listening to details or seeing scans
A	but remember those two have been friends since they were like little boys and he's like I really don't wanna know how how much dilated your girlfriend's girlfriend is really
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	I'm sort cos I'm I'm quite I quite like science TE you know so
A	aha
B	I'm not  I'm not
A	yeah
B	trying to help like I suppose if TE you know if you were having a child and uh something something had gone wrong or something I'd like to know a bit of the medical side so
A	yeah
B	so I might be able to help or something like that
A	well anyway
B	um but yeah um
A	he said Me nana's been me nana
B	oh that's really good and uh
A	I was like Ah no I can't compete
B	oh yeah so
A	well they're both of them
B	oh yeah
A	she's obviously totally excited
B	alright
A	I've seen I saw in the um in the shop that I cycle past like that they do these um
B	guess I could whip whip that up and have a raita or whatever
A	ooh yeah
B	mousse chocolate mousse
A	yeah maybe
B	which if I'd been a bit
A	no it's alright
B	like got some of this this is hazelnut chocolate I can you know melt that down and mix it to make a mousse
A	the um
B	in a shop?
A	with like the logo on
B	you
A	in the shop on
B	where's that?
B	oh right yeah
A	I might get one
B	oh little baby things yeah yeah
A	as like an ironic gesture
B	no well you don't know  you don't know  Baby
A	have its brains from well not
B	mm
A	no he not but he wouldn't have gone to
B	I dunno partly it's partly cultural isn't it TE you know um I think the sort of
A	yeah
B	uh
A	yeah but I mean he wouldn't have
B	sorry I didn't? What did you?
A	no nothing
B	are you gonna close that?
A	no no no
B	um
A	does taste quite nice
B	I don't know
A	it
B	well it's as I said it it sort of um
A	it's very white peppery maybe don't put any more white pepper in for me
B	oh no I mean uh I uh
A	mm?
B	I didn't
A	it does taste like really white peppery
B	fair enough
A	no you haven't screwed it up
B	oh well never mind
A	no you haven't
B	uh it's alright well you don't have it on its own do you so I mean if you wanna put like uh put some mustard in if you wanna balance that out a bit
A	no
B	it's alright
A	what motivated you to put six six eggs in like? Was it just?
B	you could
A	why six eggs like?
B	well
A	I see yeah yeah no it's a good idea
B	well cos two cos like two
A	no
B	two scrambled eggs isn't isn't loads like I don't think
A	we we need a beater though this is a bit
B	we um if you wanna just use the  use the  electric one we could do that
A	shall I give it a try?
B	yeah if if you  if you
A	need it out for me soup anyway
B	um
A	I can  I can  do it I don't mind
B	um
A	I always worry like about using this like cos usually it's
B	I'll I'll do that it's uh if you  if you  think  you know
A	no and let's just try it
B	uh
A	is that doing it?
A	that looks more mayonnaisey already doesn't it?
A	slightly slightly faster than the uh
B	it's done the uh well it's done in like one second what like took us like fifteen minutes to do
A	huh?
B	it's going a lot
A	is it alright? What  do you think?
B	uh looks okay
A	ugh
A	it splatted on us
B	shall I have a go? Whoops
A	is it okay?
B	yeah
A	ooh
B	little bit of a
A	ooh tastes more like mayonnaise
B	it's getting  it's getting  better but it's we've just gotta get it um  you know like salad
A	needs some vinegar in it's like too sort of thick
B	oh yeah lemon yeah with uh
A	it's too sort of thick and peppery
B	sorry about that pepper uh
A	you put too much white pepper in I think
B	I think you've you've said that a couple of times already
A	sorry
B	really? I'd assumed you
A	just a small bit like I find it just
B	you you never bought any black pepper
A	no no I keep forgetting
B	with uh your hatred of white pepper
A	no it's not a hatred it's more like um
B	I dunno actually for a mayonnaise like I would've thought white pepper would go better
A	no maybe it you might even be right yeah maybe it does
B	no I think there's a lack of aroma in there
A	yeah
B	like mustard or garlic or something like  you know
A	maybe mustard would be better actually
B	we we don't have um we don't enough aroma in there
A	yeah
B	um
A	yeah
B	mm
A	were you gonna make a sandwich? Was that why you started making the mayonnaise while I was on the phone?
B	it's tuna
A	oh that'd be really
A	just press it like just let it go
B	anything else from uh
A	no I only talked to her for a minute she was um
B	or
A	no like she was
B	did you speak to
B	oh right so they were in um in the pub aren't they?
A	but she was coming down because apparently they were going to watch some wrestling thing like
B	were they are they gonna watch the wrestling in the pub or?
A	no at
B	oh right
A	she's got like some stupid Sky thing or whatever
B	I guess there isn't as much wrestling on um terrestrial TV is there?
A	well I think it was big like in the sort of um like fifties and stuff wasn't it but then
B	uh I never really I never followed it much but I know a lot of like kids did in my school and stuff
A	well
B	no no no I I mean I never really liked it that much like during my  during my  lifetime
A	you mean like like Hulk Hogan times? Yeah
B	um
A	me brother used to really like it he had like  he had like
B	just let it go
A	I suppose we can't really talk over that
B	yeah he um
A	do you think so? No he's never been that health conscious to be honest like
B	think he could uh
A	I think he'd like to but also he also just likes pies and
B	I think he just it's just inevitable to uh
A	na
B	like um
A	na I think like it wasn't really spitting that much I think if you lift it up too much it spits
B	um no I'll just hold it down and  do it
B	whoa and then it does some
A	just do it in little bits
B	oh no no no it's probably not that much
A	with a like
B	well
A	you could write blender in like square brackets
B	no you don't you wouldn't have to write blender every time
A	no I know
B	do you wanna move it further away then you wanna put it over there or something?
A	yeah but then
B	right well well put it
A	I thought it was gonna get uh mayonnaise splattered on its face
B	oh no
A	these? Yeah very
A	hey
B	those what?
A	those knitted plant holders that I've made
B	yeah they're pretty bright aren't they?
A	well they'll attract the um
B	yeah well I mean I guess they will but I don't know for certain
A	well
B	you've got like what?
A	where you've worn like a bright shirt and then you've been like bothered by wasps
B	oh like wasps and that?
A	na
B	uh
A	I suppose maybe you don't wear bright shirts
B	no but like sometimes you you you think that yeah that there's something like if you have like hair gel on it's attracting like
A	yeah
B	it's got like sugar in and it's attracting like wasps and that
A	yeah and like an
B	yeah
A	do you think we need some more oil in
B	I guess so
A	shall I have a try?
B	I mean I'm just getting a bit getting really bored of of uh
A	doing it?
B	whipping it
A	here you are then
B	I'll put this over here
A	ugh
A	feel like I'm just covered in speckles
B	um
A	Woah
B	could go back to hand whipping it
A	it did do a lot better though for a while
B	it looked like it was much better but then it sort of
A	yeah but we haven't got anything else
B	we we we weren't we want to whisk it not chop it  you know what I mean? That's a chopper
A	yeah but we haven't got anything else like
B	you know what I mean? I was thinking that the  that the  knife action from it might actually break apart the the yolk  you know what I mean?
A	maybe it was too much lemon
B	in a way that  in a way that  didn't want
A	no because once it's mixed in
B	yeah
A	I mean that's what I meant sorry
B	not not quite the same as um a chopper cos uh because because it's like a different shape um  you know the bit is a different shape isn't it so? I guess it will taste a bit nicer than than it did but uh
A	yeah
B	but it's just worth like we had a lot of eggs so I just thought we might as well try it I mean
A	well maybe we should just leave it there like
B	you think it's uh I'll probably could give it a few more hand whips and then uh
A	I'm just getting sick of
B	well you don't have to I'll just I'll do it then it doesn't matter it was just like an experiment you know
A	yeah
B	yeah it's got a decent
A	it'd be nice though anyway like as a little sauce
B	yeah yeah like one of them German yellow sauces innit?
A	yeah
B	um  do you wanna put that back where it was?
A	um sorry
B	actually we'll we'll go through shall we cos uh you've got anything
A	um
B	have you got anything more to do? I don't mind
A	I'm a bit hungry
B	okay well shall we do that then?
A	suppose so yeah
B	something like
A	what shall we have? Um how about like a
B	just tuna mayo innit?
A	well what about like a tuna cheese melt like we could toast some bread and some
B	oh right yeah okay I I quite like that idea
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	that might be quite nice
B	I'll leave that there for later cos um
A	I know yeah
B	oh well well yeah yeah we'll do it tonight yeah no problem
A	oh is this the last of the bread?
B	oh where did that go
A	I don't know
B	oh possibly yeah
A	that was part of it anyway
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	grab this and then
A	oh yeah
B	uh right
A	we might
B	no I'll just  I'll just  um
A	oh right
B	it's on and off innit?
A	I wonder what's doing that like? It's so annoying
B	oh yeah
A	I know
B	so like have we decided how many  how many
A	oh that really needs eating wonder if we should've put that in the soup?
B	no we'll cook it tomorrow or something
A	okay
B	have we decided how many um how many plants were growing now?
A	um well no so so I wrote down like the
B	yeah so I thought
A	I wrote down like the boxes that we have um at the moment
B	yeah
A	and we've got like um five of those sort of trough ones
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	They are hard to write.	Neutral
A	we've got two of those kind of big tomato tubs
B	yeah
A	and then we've got um
B	yeah
A	and also like a big um
B	uh right
A	so it's like it's collapsible
B	oh yeah yeah
A	it's collapsible so
B	right yeah
A	so you could put in like herbs or
B	um yeah
A	because I was looking at I was reading some um articles on um like this gardening thing
B	oh right
A	well it's a bit cold but they say they grow well in like a sheltered spot or in like a little greenhouse thing so if we got a little greenhouse and put its little lid down then I imagine it would grow
B	oh right
[ANNOTATION]	It is too cold for gardening.	Neutral
A	um yeah
B	yeah
A	oh no actually I'll
B	Cos you've got that bread on there
A	I know yeah
[ANNOTATION]	There is bread.	Entailment
B	I see
A	plants than the other ones
B	yeah I think that that's the case with a lot of plants isn't it like uh
A	yeah
B	black black ones
A	but this article that I read said that this one called fairy tail this variety called fairy tail was good
B	yeah
A	and um like produced a lot of uh fruit  you know given the crop given the size of the plant so that might be worth having a look at
B	right
A	but the things that I liked the most last year like in fact the year before
[ANNOTATION]	Fruit is delicious.	Neutral
B	um yeah
A	like tomatoes were really good and chillies
B	yeah
A	but earlier today I put in peas carrots which I've never done before
B	um
[ANNOTATION]	The tomatoes did not grow.	Contradiction
A	carrots and spring onions which could be really nice
B	oh right that that'll be uh that'll be good
A	so they're in now and like we have to sow them every two weeks
B	no they are in they are the
A	I know same as potatoes yeah I was surprised
B	that was a sort of a guess that I guessed at first but then I like wasn't sure
A	yeah
B	but in fact um they are the um
[ANNOTATION]	There were different potatoes.	Contradiction
A	oh they're like the
B	they're they're the type
A	the county palatine
A	you know what I mean
B	the type of uh species or the uh
A	I don't  I don't  know either
B	um
A	things that grow quite fast
B	ah a lot  of these are poisonous actually
A	I know poison ivy and stuff in that group yeah I read
A	so oh yeah so if you type go on Amazon and then type in like uh aubergine seeds
B	those like little round ones from uh?
A	you can get like baby ones um
B	oh you want me to search for how many seeds are available?
A	well just like that's a
B	oh right so you can eat some of them can't you?
A	sorry?
B	you can eat aubergine seeds can't you?
A	oh I don't know
B	yeah
A	you mean like pumpkin seeds?
B	uh yeah
A	I suppose you can
B	no it was just Google suggest uh I put in aubergine seeds and it produced that
A	oh you mean like yeah
B	like it suggested it yeah
A	huh
B	yeah
A	anyway so yeah there there's so many different varieties
B	so
A	just thought like we should get some different ones so I quite fancy doing that I mean how about you what do you  what do you  fancy growing?
B	ah I was interested in um like uh um
A	yeah
B	uh but I think pretty much the same as you I mean we've got a lot of things going so
A	no well I haven't got
B	I mean pretty much the same as you but perhaps to try and get quite a lot large quantity and then plan ahead so we try and save some money  you know use it to to um to have like a bit of a strategy and like plan to save money
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	well a fair amount of space so
A	uh no I don't I suppose I just wanted you to see like the
B	so I've got uh Real Seeds Dot Co Dot UK
A	no just go to like
B	well this is like just Google results
A	but that's funny because for us the tomatoes grew really fast and the
B	um
A	maybe it's a temperature thing
B	start them off with some heat and then either transplant out um or grow in a greenhouse
A	um where's the cheese? Is it still in my bag?
B	probably
A	yes it was
B	well they got one called uh de Barbentane
A	yeah
B	a medium sized cylindrical black aubergine from France
A	yeah
B	uh round black fruit like a tennis ball size
A	hm
B	you can save them yourself from the plant while they're inside it inside the uh inside the fruit
A	yeah
B	uh well yeah but it's still worth trying isn't it? And these ones seem to say like you you could save it yourself but um
A	oh of course
B	if you cut the seed out of the middle of it
A	yeah
B	with a bowl of water or something yeah
A	okay
B	A very ripe fruit
A	well that one is very ripe we could maybe try that one
B	rinse it through a sieve to get the seed
A	mm this cheese is a bit disappointing
B	uh this is actually selling seeds and it will sell you twenty-five for two pounds
A	yeah I saw them on uh
B	from um these these ones
A	I saw them on Amazon and stuff so
B	yeah
B	is there any news?
B	Amazon search
B	I'm just in Amazon
A	yeah there's some good ones
A	okay
B	Amazon
A	um
B	enter
A	I've got some of that left?  do you want some?
B	just searching Amazon
A	couldn't balance it on
B	oh right
A	no no no of course there's loads
B	oh right yeah
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	but I reckon you'd probably need about twenty eggs for that
A	no I don't know there's like that's quite a lot there
B	um
A	let me look
B	it's on Amazon
A	uh if you open the Amazon like um it's got like an Amazon app
B	oh yeah
A	it's um it's not on the net
B	it's not on the main desktop
A	no it's in um it's just here on the left
B	Will you uh see if is he uh is our recorder going okay?
A	ay? Uh yeah
B	so would you like to be a farmer then?
A	um
B	of of um like oranges and?
A	I sort of like the outdoor thing but I think I might get sick of it
A	if you're a farmer it's
B	ah yeah I mean it's like it sounds nice on paper doesn't it?
A	you don't get that choice
B	maybe it sounds nice but in reality it's not quite as idyllic as it sometimes
A	na
B	and
A	yeah
B	I I I thought that I would really like to be brewer
A	yeah
B	um of some sort
A	but being a brewer and being a hop grower isn't the same is it I mean?
B	I guess not although
A	I mean obviously they go hand in hand
B	no they they they yeah I mean
A	wine fine fine growing
B	yeah
A	but it's the same as anything like
B	well I mean you got some some jobs are just some jobs are definitely better than others well  you know I suppose
A	like if if my job was like knitting things all day I would I'm sure I would get totally pissed off with it like
B	yeah
A	I'd like some chickens really but I wouldn't want a farm where I had to get up at five in the morning and like
B	yeah I mean well there's a big big difference
A	well same with anything though you can of course you can you can employ someone to do your garden
B	um
A	but I don't really see the point in like people who have  you know like gardens that've got like flowers and that in
B	so you wouldn't like to live in in Spain and have a big massive load of orange trees and uh
A	yeah it might be really nice but
B	but it might be a bit of a pain
A	if you're the person who's in charge and responsible for those orange trees
B	yeah
A	then that might take the shine off
B	the problem with farming is that they suffer from  you know like um
A	crops and  pestilence yeah
B	it it there's a
A	I think it would be nice to like for example go to stay in an orange grove and for a while
B	well like I kind of like I
A	oh it's nearly done
B	yeah
A	not really one that I was responsible for and was down to me sort of thing
B	yeah um that is  that is  something that I'm guilty of
A	it's alright though
B	Amazon's got two hundred seeds for ninety-nine P
A	do you want the crust or  do you want me to have the crust?
B	probably I dunno about Amazon
A	Sutton Seeds or something? No but I just meant like
B	I mean that last website looked good
A	actually no you have this one
B	I'm not actually hungry so I can put if you put mine on the side somewhere
A	uh yeah
B	to
A	oh are you not hungry?
B	not right now but I I might be like
A	I'm sorry I shouldn't have made it if you weren't hungry
B	no cos you were hungry so
A	well that doesn't mean anything
B	it doesn't
A	kinda always hungry a bit
B	uh I'll have it later yeah
A	what have you been nibbling things in there?
B	but the you've got the suggestions for uh Amazon like
A	oh have I?
B	customers who liked this also liked would like tomatoes
A	also like
B	tomatoes money maker it says
A	what's that?
B	fifty seeds
A	I suppose it does make you money cos you you know like you spend a pound on like
B	I think tomatoes and but we also use a lot of lemons like there's a sort of advantage of that
A	ah but those tomatoes last year the smell of them like
B	yeah yeah them them cherry ones like really sort of tangy and sweet yeah
A	your parents brought those like maybe they'll bring some more
B	yeah I'm gonna uh see if they don't mind bringing some stuff
A	I wouldn't mind if she did
B	uh yeah
A	that is that mine? Oh I can't handle everything
A	ah thank you
A	ah you left the lid off
B	ah well yeah I couldn't fit it on but it's
A	oh right
B	it should be alright in the short term
A	no it's fine
A	yeah
B	um
A	like a internet TV?

B	like if
A	um
B	but still like I like  you know for Sunday like it's good to have a bit of uh a bit of documentary isn't it?
A	I do like it but I'm gonna if we're doing this I dunno if I can
B	uh not not a massive fan of Britain's Got Talent uh

A	no
B	ah
A	have a bit
B	uh no I'm okay for now
A	maybe it's the cheese
B	the rocket that's doing that?
A	uh
B	so what what job would you do like ideally then cos like
A	I do quite like my job really I mean
B	you're saying just just no job then?
A	mm
B	gotta do  gotta do  a bit
A	I like my job in that like it's quite varied and it does use the skills that I've got
B	but you
A	yeah
B	if you  if you  didn't need money
A	but I think I'd also like to indulge my creative side
B	yeah?
A	do more knitting and
A	that kind of thing but
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	but with with more like if I had a bit more money then I I'd be able to get like better equipment and stuff
A	yeah
B	um
A	I dunno
B	oh um yeah
A	I mean I think it's it'd be fabulous to do this but
B	you mean like well talking of Britain's Got Talent I mean  you know like a being a star
A	well
B	right
A	I don't understand why people wanna do it
B	although
A	yeah
B	but
A	but that's for the that's for being in a band not cos you wanna be like pop star

A	no
B	nor would people want to uh to listen to me

A	but now he's going door to door
B	uh okay fair enough I mean
A	well not fair enough
B	I I don't personally
A	they're just annoying
B	yeah I I don't like  I don't like  it when someone
A	me neither
B	it's I mean if it was here like I think we're  benefiting from the fact that we're in a flat and therefore like you
A	no I don't
B	no it's
A	I think if someone was like
B	Cos we don't
A	I think if someone was really urgently like
B	yeah I know  it is  it is um there is something that's sort of
A	I hate all that stuff
B	I mean the thing with a charity is that you you have to beg otherwise you you won't get anything will you unless you can somehow secure government funding from somewhere or unless you you
A	yeah
B	yeah so he must be
A	oh obviously yeah
B	he he's always works many hours doesn't he? Um that's just  that's just  what he likes isn't it?
A	well he's working twenty-four hours at the pub and sixteen hours at this thing and then
B	I suppose importing
A	yeah but never getting anywhere
B	is he buying how's he buying it cos he's buying stuff from China isn't he?
A	he's um
B	and who's he
A	he's buying them from China
B	yeah
A	certain wrestlers like I don't really follow the wrestling
B	no I don't don't following wrestling no but
A	all these different wrestlers or whatever
A	right so he wanted to buy
B	tent Peg and his arch enemy Stone or Mister Pebbles or whatever like
B	yeah
A	and he realized he could only get it from the US or from China
B	yeah
A	well no
B	yeah so bought like a
A	he
B	yeah

A	well he said it's doing some
B	it it did sound promising um
A	so
B	well he's he's really coming out with  you know masses of ideas masses of like plans and that
A	he has to
B	I think I would've though that
A	no no it's fine
B	well keep it  keep it  going or or?
A	yeah I know
B	I think he he would try and maybe get something with a higher rate of pay so that if if if possible
A	yeah he really should
B	I think
A	well I don't know
B	I think that that is  that is  more it's the most promising sort of thing
A	depends like how much the demand is for like these
B	well yeah I mean I suppose you make connections and
A	yeah
B	um you could use those connections to sort of
A	well yeah I mean or it might lead on to different things you just don't know
B	although
A	but he'll be fine like
B	really?
A	comes out of it okay
B	would you say he  would you say he  always comes out okay like?
A	no because he he makes it okay like he just he'd work  he'd work  a hundred hours a week if needed to like

A	he's not one of these people who's like I've got nothing to do and I've got loads of bills
B	yeah I mean he's he's the
A	yeah I know
B	you tell them what
A	no that's what I get  that's what I get  annoyed about like
B	the the only
