C	do you want some water as well?
A	yeah if you don't
C	what?
A	Dad's Army
C	yeah
A	cool
C	hold on
A	how many times have you played this game?
C	I've only played it once
A	how old is this map? is this before
A	the world was truly mapped?
C	how old is this game?
B	I dunno
A	is this before they got maps right?
B	it's as old as you
A	yeah probably the map's kind of wrong
A	just looks really strange China's tiny
B	I thought China was big I thought
A	yeah
B	Japan was quite small
B	I thought it just had Japan was big
A	but here Japan's as big as Australia
B	oh I see what you're saying yeah
A	China's tiny China's about the same size as India in this
C	where's oh
A	this is an old map I mean they're calling it Siam where's the rest of the countries? this should be Taiwan's
C	is there a year on it?
A	pretty retro isn't it?
B	well no it's supposed to be from the Crimean War or something
C	oh
A	oh is it set? oh okay it's set
C	that yeah
A	in a different time that makes sense doesn't it?
B	mm
A	I never played this before so you're gonna have to teach me
C	it took you a while you were looking at it wondering
B	I wondered what he was going on about
B	what's he going on about?
A	you and
A	yeah
A	is that the style now?
C	yeah
A	I've seen a few people with those kind of haircuts
C	yeah
A	shaved er er around and then a bit longer on top
A	oh you did it?
C	yeah
A	no wonder it looks so good
B	do you want pink?
C	oh what cos I'm a girl?
B	yeah
C	okay
B	I'm gonna have blue what colour do you want?
A	red if there's a red
B	it's very easy
A	right okay
C	right what shall we do then? have it kind of like
B	it's all about global domination
C	have it like that?
A	yeah that sounds good
B	erm I dunno how many
C	you'll have to explain to me again what we're doing
A	how long does it take to play?
B	can't remember how many how many erm
C	it's supposed to take hours but the way I play it it'll be finished
B	no it won't take long
A	alright for hours every hour we record
C	mm
A	I'll get those pieces out don't know if it's necessary
B	right there's
C	yeah
B	different sorts of pieces
A	otherwise I'm gonna have to actually get a job
C	that'll be hard after what you're doing at the moment
A	yeah oh you've got a bubble in your throat
C	oh I did did you hear it?
A	oh right they're all slightly different shapes are they? there's like a
C	what do you do with these thing?
A	three three-prong four-prong five-prong
C	oh have we worked
B	yeah there's five-prong ones there's four-prong ones and there's three-prong ones
A	yeah and is that it? so it's do we just separate them into those piles?
C	what do they mean then what's the difference to these?
B	er the five-prong ones are worth ten armies
A	are there single ones?
B	well the three-prong ones
A	oh the singles yeah okay
B	are the single one armies
A	cool this is gonna take a little while to do this isn't it?
C	I must say I didn't get the hang of it really last time
A	yeah what happened there?
C	well I just put them all in one country
A	are you not allowed to do that?
C	well it worked and I won but
A	thought your friends won't notice
C	no he just told me that that wasn't the way to play it and I said why? I've won
A	you were doing it wrong
C	and that was that
A	did you actually win though? or did you
C	yeah
A	just play it wrong and procedures
C	no
A	if you win
C	I won didn't I?
A	did she win?
B	I think I think you did yeah
C	it was kind of like
A	oh you get a quite a few more of these ones than you do of these ones don't you?
B	I think don't you have to? it's thirty-five I think so you have to get thirty-five
A	so we've gotta make
B	of singles
A	five
B	and that's what
C	thirty-five singles?
B	that's what you start with yeah
A	ten
C	oh my god
A	fifteen
B	I mean it'll be the singles out
A	twenty
C	well I realise now I've got room for my singles in there
A	twenty-five
B	no you just start with thirty-five
A	oh
B	you should have some left over
A	ten twenty
C	two four
A	oh I'm counting them wrong
C	six eight
A	five ten fifteen twenty
C	ten
A	thirty-five and how many of the other ones are you meant to have?
C	twelve
B	no it doesn't matter don't know it doesn't matter
A	well do we put these ones in there
C	forty
A	do we?
B	yeah you just start off with thirty-five cos you need to put these on the the countries
C	sixteen eighteen
A	arbitrarily?
B	er?
A	are
B	no no you have the cards
C	twenty
A	oh it tells you where to do it
C	twenty-two
A	I've heard about this game a lot but I've never played it
C	twenty-four
A	oh lovely
C	it was the door
A	cos it's being recorded?
A	that was
B	you are an animal you know that?
C	sorry
A	it's heard worse
C	two four
A	are these mine?
B	yeah
C	ten twelve
A	can I look at them?
C	fourteen
B	yeah
C	sixteen
A	can I reorder them?
C	eighteen
B	you don't need to
C	twenty twenty-two twenty-four
B	cos you you're just gonna put one army on
C	twenty-six
B	a country
C	twenty-eight
B	and then when all the
A	oh
C	thirty
B	when you've all the
C	thirty-two
A	yeah you're gonna have to explain this now I don't understand the so I'll just
C	wait a minute I haven't even got these thirty-two thirty-four
B	no it's thirty-five you want
C	what?
B	you only want thirty-five
A	no he didn't
C	oh well I've got thirty-six
A	it's recorded there's proof
B	we'll rewind it
C	yeah can you rewind? there's
A	no
C	hang on
A	double
C	here you are I've got thirty-five now
B	that's it
B	and you just erm
C	right now what?
B	you put one of your armies on
C	where?
A	I don't understand so do I choose any card?
C	on the country?
B	yeah they've all gotta be filled up
A	oh okay so I just
A	unless I just have no idea about geography but
A	this is
C	but you probably have a better idea than I do
A	completely changed
A	look how big Ontario is
C	remember it's the Korean War no what is it?
A	Crimean
C	Crimea
B	well I think it I think it's based on the Crimean War
C	right so what? so I've got Western Australia
A	there's a Western Australia here
C	where's that then?
A	oh I've got New Guinea that's pretty
B	where's Australia?
A	surely you know where Australia is
B	over there
C	I don't I'm rubbish with geography
A	are you
C	yeah I am
A	really you don't know where Australia is?
C	oh Alberta what's that?
A	it's a state in America
C	well I don't know that either see this'll help
C	Brazil
A	Middle East
B	it's all spread out here
A	is that a bad thing? should we be like together?
C	where's Brazil?
A	come on mum
C	I'm rubbish
C	Scandinavia
A	Central America
C	thank you
A	Liguria
C	places
A	yeah
C	Ukraine
A	oh what Ukraine that big is it? oh great one
C	Madagascar
B	it might well have been
A	you know where the lemurs are from?
C	yeah
A	yeah it may well have been you're right
C	Western United States
A	but regardless of what it may or may not have been
C	Quebec
A	Japan hasn't changed size
B	no
C	Ontario
A	I mean there's Korea right? Japan it should be about like that next to Korea
C	oh America's gonna be mine
A	it only just slightly comes down past Korea so it's gonna be like that
C	Egypt
A	it's freaking huge look at that where is Mongolia? I mean
C	what's Ural?
A	just just makes no sense
C	what is it?
A	it's just an area
C	Siam
A	in Russia
C	now what happens?
C	oh
B	well throw the dice and see who goes first
A	so what do I do with the spare that weren't thirty-five? are they just
B	right at
A	out of the game?
B	at the beginning of every go well now we need to allocate these now to to the countries that you want to defend and or attack from
A	okay but
B	and the object of the game is to take over the
A	the whole thing
B	the whole world yeah
A	but do you remember you said we need thirty-five of these and there were a bunch of spares?
B	yeah well you
A	are the spares in the game or?
B	well you you lose them but you can also win them back at the beginning of your go and by collecting these cards
A	okay so I keep two separate piles of these there's the spares and then there's my
B	well the thirty-five will go well the rest of the thirty-five will go on the board in a second
A	and what about the spare ones? is what I'm asking
B	well
A	cos there were like forty-five or something
B	yeah well you
A	you can take some out
B	yeah
A	so let's separate I'll do what you guys are doing with these things
B	someone didn't put Iceland down
A	is that cos no one's got it or
B	well
A	is there a card missing?
B	there should have been an Iceland
A	mm
B	you got Iceland missing?
C	oh no you'll have to make a card up
A	yeah so we only get one of each people in each place
C	was this your game?
B	yeah
C	so it wasn't your grandad's?
B	no I bought it
A	it's not that old
A	Risk armies
C	it's about twenty-eight years old did you say about
B	it's gotta be older than that
A	is this the limit of how many armies you can have in each place?
B	if you hold the whole of the continent that's how many armies you get at the beginning of your go there is an Iceland but
A	oh
B	so someone didn't put a thing on
A	so we need to count who's missing one
C	how many? okay I've got one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve
A	I've got thirteen
A	how many have you got
B	hold on I thought I counted fourteen then one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen I've got
A	what? one two
B	how many have you got?
A	three four five six nine ten eleven twelve thirteen I've only got thirteen
B	and how many have you got?
C	I've got one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve
B	must be yours then
A	thirteen
C	thirteen fourteen
A	fourteen the same as me
C	is that right? hold on one two three four
A	five
C	five six seven eight nine
B	you've counted that twice
A	I know just
B	three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen it's yours then
A	so it's me? but did I just not get dealt it over there?
B	no you'd have been the you just must have missed it or it got stuck together or something
A	oh sorry
C	probably got stuck together
A	so I got Iceland
A	it might be me wasn't it?
A	we've got enough dice there?
B	yeah
B	hold on well you if you're attacking you have three if you're defending you have two
A	I really don't understand what's happening
B	you will you will
C	no me neither
B	and then to go from
A	oh by boat?
B	North North Africa can attack Western Europe or whatever
A	oh okay so this counts as one and this counts as
B	that's an army yeah
A	two armies
B	that counts as five
A	five armies?
B	and the other one counts as ten
A	so five of these is one of these?
B	yeah
A	okay and ten of these is one of these?
B	yeah
A	okay alright
A	oh
C	bless you
B	excuse me
A	is there any way we can move this a little bit more just cos I've got terrible eyes?
C	have you really?
A	yeah my eyes aren't very good
C	have you had them tested?
A	yes many years ago and do you remember I got glasses and then I never wore them?
C	yeah same as me you're like your mother
B	smells very musty don't it?
C	oh it does yeah
A	I want to smell
B	smell them musty cards
A	very musty
B	right now you take turns to put one on
B	one on each
A	why's that tickled you so much?
B	I want to smell it
C	let me smell
B	now you take it in turns to put an army on
A	oh without pulling a card or doing anything?
B	yeah
C	and is this an army?
A	is there any cards? is there not even any cards there?
B	that's your cards there
A	right
B	and you only get a card if you can if you take another country and then at the
B	at the end of the go then you get a card and then if you get one er in erm artillery erm infantry or cavalry or whatever it is you get three of them and then you get ten
A	okay
B	at the beginning of your go if you hold a whole continent then you get the the amount of armies that correspond down there
A	are we gonna have enough time for two games of this?
B	I doubt it
A	and this no okay can we then can we play for like twenty minutes and then start again?
B	yeah
A	so I understand
C	really?
A	is that alright? yeah I mean
C	okay
A	that's that's fair isn't it?
B	that's fair yeah
A	so I kind of get the hang of it
C	if I'd have said that to you you'd have said no just pick it up as you go along
B	well it's it's not an not a particularly easy game you had loads of goes before you understood it
B	and now you seem to have forgotten
C	I haven't
A	I just need twenty minutes
C	I've already had loads of games
A	as long as I play like two or three rounds then then we should start again
C	right
A	because I've probably fluffed it by that point
C	I'm so glad you've said that cos I have no idea what I'm doing
A	cool
C	right go
B	right
A	you just said we just put one down in the place
C	right so we just choose where we want to defend
A	in order or anything goes?
B	you're supposed to do it in order so you you the cos er you just sort of clump them all on there and then everybody is gonna clump them everywhere but
A	so I'm gonna be looking for where I can invade?
B	yeah and where you can hold
C	you can only put one on at a time
B	that's the idea
A	how do you attack someone else?
C	so you have to stay in your own
A	when you've got five? only when you've got five can you
C	country don't you? you can't like I can't suddenly put that there can I?
B	no that's on my country you can't
C	exactly
C	that's what I'm saying I'll have to stay on pink
A	glad we clarified that
B	that was quite an obvious rule
C	not to the other side apparently
A	so do you have any tactical advice?
B	erm well
A	okay
B	even though you get your five armies at the beginning of each of every go it's difficult to hold it's er same with Asia a lot of countries can attack it
A	okay
B	and you can attack from Alaska to Kamchatka
A	oh it crosses over
B	cos it crosses over there
A	okay
B	so you can either attack from this side as well
A	so so mum's got a good hold then with a bit of that and that that's kind of like a
C	oh
B	well you get a lot of points there's seven at the beginning of
A	oh is that what these pins are?
C	oh
A	so you've only got one at one a way to get in through Siam so Siam can attack Indonesia but you only get two you only get two down here as well it would be South America
C	who keeps the points?
A	explain to me what this means
B	no two armies
C	oh
B	so if I if I hold all of South America at the beginning of my go then I get two extra armies
A	oh okay so you oh okay
B	and you could put them wherever you want
A	ah so you've gotta hold the whole of something
C	how do you know if you've held it?
B	well cos your that colour would be blue
C	right
B	or the other one
A	so I wanna get Australia
C	okay
A	or cos I'm near there I've got a couple of pieces here so
C	so how do you get mine?
A	I don't really
B	we'll get to the
A	I can invade
B	well at least three
A	oh three to invade?
B	three
A	oh not five?
B	no
C	so so right you've got
B	but we'll get to that in a minute
C	okay
A	right so
C	I've put mine down on there
A	right well arbitrarily place this
B	yeah I guess so
A	so then you've had your go mum?
B	but then that can't attack the blue
C	why?
A	ah
B	cos it's not joining
A	ah bugger so really I started with these no I can attack mum though can't I? and once I've attacked that one I can take that one can't I?
B	yeah you can do that
C	thank you for warning me
A	so it's my go again so I can move with three? yeah
B	you could yeah three against one could go
A	so I can kill her?
B	you could do
A	but that's bad because she'll just move in here?
C	so if I had three in here
B	no you like you don't wanna leave yourself too thin
C	so if I had three
B	cos you cos you've gotta be holding at the beginning of your go not at the end of your go so if you leave yourself thin and just leave yourself one on there and mum's got loads on there so you just
A	oh so I need to leave something there
C	so if I had three on here
B	well he could do yeah but then it would be quite a battle
C	well
A	oh there's a battle is there?
C	who would win?
A	rolling the dice is it?
B	well it's it's the roll of the dice
C	oh
B	you don't just decide
C	I thought we just was going like this
A	cool
A	no no it's your go now it goes
C	I
A	it goes
C	I think you've had more goes than anybody else
A	well count how many pieces one two three four he's had four goes I've had one two three goes
B	and you've had one two three it's your go
A	oh
B	in what do you mean?
A	so
A	it's my go and I wanna attack her with these
B	yeah well you don't you can't move into a country until you've attacked her
A	so I can put most of these
B	to Western Australia
A	okay
B	and you'd throw the dice if mum was to lose them two armies then you could move your armies into her country
A	however many I want to brilliant
C	so it's dependent on the dice
B	yeah
A	so I wanna attack Western Australia
C	you can't yet
A	Western
B	you've got the go yeah you've gotta put all these armies on first
A	oh
B	I did say that at the beginning
A	you've gotta put all the armies on the board first
C	go on your turn
A	oh I'd have been been thinking a bit differently about it
A	your go
C	I'm thinking
A	alright less of that nobody ever got anywhere doing any thinking
A	oh bloody hell
B	yours I think
A	it's your go I think
C	is it?
A	yeah
C	you sure?
A	yeah
C	okay let's see who's attacking me or who's going to be attacking me?
A	yeah don't know
C	what about all these ones over here?
B	just put everything on one
A	only one?
C	yeah cos he couldn't attack my country
A	yeah
C	is it my go?
B	I think so yeah
B	I dunno
C	I'll just follow you then
A	I am oh dear
B	I'm trying to keep my armies in one place rather than spread them around that's what I'm trying to do
C	yeah but you've got like armies here
B	yeah
C	so what are you gonna do with them?
B	well er I'll catch up with them later
C	are you gonna let oh okay I've gotta watch him
A	yeah I know
C	cos he's played it before so
C	we've gotta know what he's doing so we've gotta keep our armies in one place
A	well your go I think
C	no it's my go
A	oh right I like how quick the goes are
C	are we gonna love this game when we've finished?
A	I'm not sure
A	I dunno
C	better put another one in there
C	cos it's like overloaded that one that'll
A	fight that out
C	yeah I've gotta watch you over there as well oh it's not your go it's your go
A	how have you put all your pieces? I've still got two alright I'll just put these two here over here
A	not sure what happened there right now what happens?
B	well throw a darts dice to see who goes first
A	oh right
B	that one this one
C	just one?
B	five five spins
C	is
A	four
A	oh one's obviously low isn't it? I mean one's never high
B	six so you go a first
A	no one's one's high
B	you go first
A	so does it go
C	so what then you
A	to me and then you?
C	to me to you to you to me
B	no it goes clockwise unfortunately
A	they turned out to be paedos didn't they?
C	who was it?
B	did they?
A	yeah the Chuckle Brothers
C	no
A	yeah I'm pretty sure
B	I didn't know that
A	that that was a while ago that was before all of that stuff
C	Rolf Harris was the one that kind of like shocked me
B	don't
A	I know
B	you can't just throw a dice and
C	well you said throw the dice
B	well
A	Rolf Harris shocked me too
B	only to see who's going first
A	I mean if Rolf Harris
C	oh okay
A	you know if it can happen to it could have happened to anyone
C	exactly
A	what I really don't want is to hear about David Attenborough or something that would just kill me
C	oh my god I know
A	it would just be game over after that if David Attenborough is a paedo
C	or Michael Parkinson
A	I don't know who that is
C	he does the chat
B	why Michael Parkinson?
C	because he's such a nice guy
B	or David Beckham
C	yeah
B	bit random innit? Michael Parkinson?
C	well
A	David Attenborough that's not random it's the voice of god
A	I mean can you imagine if
C	James Mason
B	that's the voice of God
C	yeah
A	the queen that would be a bit strange wouldn't it?
C	come on tell me what am I doing?
A	well you
A	oh god I left him here I didn't mean to do that
C	what before I shake the dice?
B	yeah you've got to say
C	you can't move him cos that was your one country
A	no I know yeah
B	you're gonna say I attacked from
C	okay
B	from somewhere to somewhere else
C	oh excuse you
A	that was not me
A	mum you keep farting all night and you blame it on
C	squeaky chair I'm going to attack
A	that's my duck impression
C	Eastern Australia
B	that's me then
C	yeah
B	so okay so mum can throw three dice cos she got three armies
A	okay
B	and I only got one oops I only got one army
C	you've got none now
A	but it's still
B	so I can throw
B	only throw one dice
A	where did that go?
C	why are you coughing like that?
A	cos I've been smoking
C	oh did it go away when you stopped?
A	yes except for the asthma bit
B	and if you're defending and your
A	oh
B	and it they've got a slight advantage with that way but they've got a disadvantage cos they only kind of they've gotta throw less dice
A	okay so
B	you you can throw three dice and if she
A	so for example if she rolls a four now and you roll a four
B	I win
C	mum to you
A	but then she's got two more die
C	she the cat's mother
B	well just throw them all at the same time
A	oh so if she's not gonna roll a four
C	mum
A	she's like
B	and you always have to throw first and attack her
B	I wonder
A	what's wrong with you?
A	why have you always hated that?
A	they're pronouns they're there to replace nouns
C	right what do I do? shake the dice?
B	and just yeah just roll
A	he's just explained
C	yeah but I didn't understand
A	tally that how good's your maths?
B	six
C	I haven't got six
A	that's not six is it?
B	there's a six it's the highest dice
C	oh
B	you've only got you've only got one dice
A	oh you only count the highest?
B	yes
C	oh okay
A	oh you don't add them all together?
B	no
A	cos then I thought there's no way that you can win
B	so I've got a five so
A	so that just
B	yeah er you reckon
A	you're not having that
C	well that was easy
B	so like you're back in there and that's it and you'd have to move some armies into Eastern Australia
A	how many?
C	what some new ones?
B	no no just
A	how do you make new ones again? oh just one is it?
B	that's it
C	just I can have as many as I like?
B	well you can move two if you want it's up to you
C	erm
A	move all three
C	oh
A	mm
B	well it can't be three cos you've gotta the be the country occupied
C	oh yeah
A	and you can't so you can't empty it and you can't
C	I think I'm gonna leave on
B	no
C	cos you've got quite a few over there
A	okay so erm
C	it's your go then
A	yeah
C	so
B	is that it?
C	yeah
A	oh does she get another go?
C	well I don't know what do you mean? what do you mean?
B	well you can attack as many countries as you want it's up to you but if you as soon as you take another country
A	oh right so mum does mum does all
B	you can have a card
C	as soon as I've taken another country
B	you can have a card
C	okay
A	oh so does she keep attacking until she loses?
B	well no I don't cos then you can leave yourself yourself a bit thin
C	so what do I do with that card?
A	but you
B	you can attack as many times as you want
A	in her round? so it's her go she can attack as many times as she want if she decided to attack
B	and if she's taken a country then she can say okay I've stopped then you get a card
C	okay okay
A	okay
C	I'm not ready to quit yet
B	carry on then
C	I'm going to attack
A	and when you've finished you take a card?
B	yeah
A	and what happens to the card how's that bit?
B	and then if you get three of each that's different ones that's the joker so that captures anything so if you get a er infantry cavalry artillery then you get ten extra goes at the beginning of your go
A	oh
C	I'm going to attack Eastern United States
B	go on
A	don't you need three power of three?
B	from where?
A	to attack it?
C	oh
A	is that right?
B	yeah
A	you need three of these things
B	yeah
C	I'm going to attack the Northwest Territory
B	you certainly need more than
C	I so
A	oh so you can attack
B	but you can't you can't
A	you can attack with two then it doesn't
B	yeah
C	look I'm going to war
B	but you can't attack somebody that's got two on there as well it's a bit more complicated but go on then but you can't attack there cos it's not joining
A	that's the simplest rule we'll stick with that one first shall we?
C	what?
A	you've got to attack joining then
C	I I could if I had two on there
B	no you
A	could she attack one-on-one?
B	yeah but you can only throw one dice you can't lose the country if you're attacking
C	you can't lose the country if you're attacking
B	yeah so you can't
A	how would she lose the country? if my die was higher would I
B	yeah
A	then invade her?
C	no no I'd have to have two
B	because if you were to lose you can't you can't lose you're not allowed to lose your country
A	okay
B	if you're attacking
C	okay
A	so you need that
B	and then if if you did win you can't move any army it cos you
C	no I know no I I know I can't do that cos I've only got one army there
B	yeah
A	glad we came to that conclusion
B	yeah and
C	and I need three
B	you can't attack there because it's not there's nothing bordering it
A	so we've done the can'ts let's do the cans
C	so I can't even go in there if I wanted to if I had two or three
B	Jesus no
C	armies there I couldn't do it
A	yeah this must have been
B	well no yeah yeah you can
A	how on earth did this play when mum had them all in one thing?
C	so how many armies?
A	I don't really understand
C	how many armies?
B	are you
C	yes just wait a minute
B	you've gotta have more than one army on there
C	that's what I just said
B	well there isn't any more than one army on there
C	but then you said yeah but then you said at the end of that but then you can't attack anyway cos it's not adjoining
A	yeah well it's
B	well
A	you can only attack from here to here
C	no I never
A	you did you said
B	you said I wanna attack Eastern United States
A	and we well
C	no I said Northwest Territory
A	oh yeah right right right
C	I changed cos you said I can't cos it's not adjoining and I realised that
A	chopping and changing chopping and changing
C	anyway
B	so you're attacking now are you?
C	yeah I'm attacking the Northwest Territory
B	go on then
C	so I throw
B	you throw three
C	three
C	five
A	oh five
B	five so that's one for you
A	why is this one really off-centre?
C	why?
B	cos I won
C	no I had five
B	yeah well my five beats your five
A	but he's defending so his
B	you don't listen
A	five it's yours
C	I it's not a matter me not listening
A	what is it then?
C	it's a matter of me not understanding
B	okay well in
B	I if it I'm defending so my dice beats yours
C	beat beats mine
B	if it equals
A	where'd you get this dodgy dice from
C	okay
A	that's got er one that's not even
C	right I'm gonna stop now
A	not even in the middle?
C	cos I need to learn
A	doesn't she have to stop anyway cos she lost?
C	do I get a card?
B	no you carry on
A	she can just keep going?
B	you keep going as long as you want yeah
A	is there any reason to keep going? like
C	might get a bit boring if someone keeps going
B	er I don't think there is at the beginning
A	if you just keep attacking ours
B	well you can er you can leave yourself too thin
C	it's a tactical game isn't it?
B	and then if you get at the beginning of the the game you're not actually making any armies cos you haven't got many cards you obviously haven't got any continents to to get your
A	Egypt's mine by the way I'd get out
C	okay right do I get a card now?
B	you get a card cos you've got Eastern Australia
C	and what do I do now with this card?
B	you just keep it until you've got a set
A	oh so
C	what's that mean?
A	if she won more than one she gets another card?
B	that's it means there's a joker it means anything
C	okay so you'll explain to me at some point what I can do with a joker?
A	or anything mum
B	I already have done
C	what did you say?
A	no I don't remember what it was
B	it infantry artillery and cavalry you get one of each then you get ten new armies
A	but what does infantry artillery and cavalry mean?
B	that that's artillery
A	what do you do with it?
B	you don't do anything with it
A	oh what's the point of it?
B	well you get you get ten armies
C	so you what? ten of these? one of these which is ten?
B	that's infantry
C	one of these?
B	artillery oh well five singles
C	or five singles and what's the
B	and the cavalry
C	artillery then?
A	no no I'm lost on this bit
B	okay that's
A	on this one
B	that's cavalry
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	the horse man on the horse
C	yeah where are
B	infantry cos the the cannon
C	yeah yeah I understand that bit
B	artillery cos he's cos he hasn't got a horse
A	so how do these correlate? which one's the infantry artillery and cavalry?
B	that is just if you get three cards different then you get ten armies
A	oh
C	oh
B	you've just gotta get three different cards
A	and then
C	oh
B	at the beginning of your go
C	okay you didn't explain that bit
B	I did
A	wasn't great
C	I explained it perfectly
A	it wasn't great
A	so it's my go?
B	it's your go and you're handing the dice to
A	and erm even the dodgy one
B	even the dodgy one
A	look that one's clearly straight but this one's gone a bit you know wang eye
A	oh that's a bit of a racist expression isn't it?
C	it's got a dodgy the eye
B	Marty Feldman eyes
C	wang eye what does that mean?
A	have you never heard that expression?
C	no
A	gozzy-eyed my mum would say
A	gozzy-eyed?
B	gozzy-eyed he's got gozzy eyes
A	have you heard wang eye?
B	wang eye?
A	I presume it's like being from Asia or something having a wang eye Mr Wang
C	oh maybe
A	or like
A	I don't know right okay alright I'm gonna invade
B	from where?
A	oh no she's got the power of three actually maybe I won't oh from here from er from yeah no not from there from from here from China
B	from China
A	yeah
B	China to Siam well you throw first then
A	do I get four?
B	no you've only got three dice so that's the maximum you can throw
A	oh
C	but you've only got one anyway
B	four and two
C	so do I get an extra dice?
A	why does the two matter?
B	cos you're throwing two your mum's throwing two
A	throwing two what?
B	two dice
A	no I'm throwing three dice
B	yeah mum's throwing two
A	oh
B	so your two best dice is four and two and mum's two best dice are
A	oh it's gotta be two of her best dice?
C	why why am I not throwing three?
B	you haven't got three you've only can defend with two
A	oh we didn't know that either
B	you did
B	just throw the dice
A	but you only had one last time why didn't you?
C	and you
B	yeah but I I only had one army
C	you've gotta keep your cool
B	no only
C	you can't defend with three?
B	if you've got more than one army you can defend with two dice
A	oh okay
C	okay
A	and the maximum attacking is three?
B	yeah
A	why now
C	okay
A	so I'm using two my best ones because
C	because I've got two
A	she's got two okay
B	only got two to beat so what's that?
A	four and a three
B	so that's two off of you
C	I beat it then
B	both dice beat yours
C	so
B	there's two armies off for
C	so I take two of
B	yeah
A	oh that's not very nice
C	let me have the
A	yeah well you won didn't you? so do these just
B	go back in there yeah
A	cool that was crap wasn't it
C	you can go again
A	oh I have to try try again?
B	but I wouldn't try from China cos then you could only throw one dice
A	yeah and she'll beat me won't she? which is probably not good
B	a two and a two
C	that was rubbish and are you still attacking me in Siam?
A	we're gonna stop after another five minutes though aren't we and start again? I really like the beginning bit when we get
B	two and or one off each
C	oh you beat so one off each why?
B	cos your two beat his two and his two beats your one
A	oh right so
C	ah
A	and I can't invade?
B	yeah you can carry on
C	take yours off
B	and so
A	oh so I've gotta get until she's got nothing on
B	yeah so you can still throw three and mum can still throw two
A	oh I'm gonna take you with India again
B	six and two
A	bloody hell you
C	one off each
A	you're this is crap aren't you?
B	you can only throw two this time or you're going from from India again and you can only throw one
A	six and four
C	yeah but you only get one
A	six six
C	gotta get your best
A	yeah yeah
B	that Siam's gone so
A	move into there do I?
B	that's it
A	right that's alright and erm I'm gonna take you again from here
C	where to?
A	three on one
C	where are you attacking?
A	Eastern Australia
C	thank you
B	a six
C	oh I can only
B	you can only throw a one six to be
C	five
A	nice
C	oh don't chuck it
A	now I can move him right?
B	yeah
A	and I only have to move him one?
B	yeah
A	one two not there even oh he can move there
C	can you move two?
B	can if you want
C	but then erm
A	is there any point? is there any point?
C	well
B	I wouldn't have thought so
A	no okay and I'm gonna take out this one so I'm gonna take you with
C	yeah like there's someone else playing on this game you know
A	I know I just want this area
A	so when I start or whatever happens I get something or other
B	yeah
C	just try and keep them off the board
B	so five and one
A	I've got five and a wangy one
C	you you can throw two
A	oh
B	six and three so it's two off
A	oh brilliant oh did I knock one of these? I had one of these here
B	er let me have the pleasure of throwing yours away
A	alright well I had one here didn't I?
C	no you
B	you had two in there
A	and I moved one here
C	yeah just one there
B	no you had three on there and you moved one across there should be two on the yeah
A	oh yeah yeah yeah is that right?
B	I think so
A	bit confused I want one last pop at the champ
C	you can't say that alright you're at war you don't ask me you just do it
B	five and four
A	come on you'd need to get lucky with these die rolls
B	three and one two off you
A	I'll move in then
C	do you have to do it like so like
A	it's war
C	chuck it like that?
A	so what happens now? I've got the whole thing
B	well now you get a card if you want in you go
A	and what's this thing?
B	yeah you get that at the beginning of your go
A	next time?
B	if you hold onto it yeah
A	cool
B	not really quite a stronghold there haven't you?
A	cool maybe we don't have to restart the game
A	yeah
C	oh I think maybe we should
A	so I'll just so I've gotta so let me just to clarify I need three different types of these to win ten more of these?
B	yeah
A	okay that's all that they do?
B	well you can get three of the same but it's not worth it cos there's like four armies and five armies and six armies or something but I can't remember cos I've lost the instructions but just to get your three
C	how many people is this game meant to play with?
B	as long as you're playing on the same
A	three four
B	erm six
A	oh there's two
B	three more yeah you can play six
A	cool
B	er Venezuela from wherever this is Brazil? no Peru
A	and how do you win the game?
B	by having your colours all over the world
A	the whole world?
B	yeah it's a long game
A	cool lots of die rolling I see here
A	good at rolling die cool does this whale do anything?
B	three
B	three I've been that's you

A	bloody hell I didn't mean to
B	Central America
A	oh he's moving
C	it's gonna be the next one
A	armies
B	five
A	oh great crap
C	I think you should have little soldiers rather than these things or tanks
A	I mean I agree
B	they do
A	but this is back in the bygone era wasn't it?
A	I mean the the map it's just
B	oh dear four and three
A	so you roll two die
C	six and two
A	wow
B	oh dear six and one
A	and you're attacking the same one again
C	six and six
A	wow what's happens with doubles?
B	it's not good
A	so he's attacking those now anyway
B	six and five
A	he wants the whole of America
C	six and one
B	and again
C	six and one
B	stop getting the six
A	she's a bit of a lucky roller
C	well excuse me I'm not gonna give up that easily

C	six and five
A	six
B	oh look at that
C	roll over and die

C	no it's not
A	it's gonna take me a while to get Asia isn't it? I mean it's ridiculous that
C	you'd be daft to stop now
A	the hardest one on the board
B	mm
A	right
B	I'll have mum will go
A	right
B	double four
A	that's a lucky roll of this one some of it's sixes every time
C	oh
A	oh
C	you shouldn't have said that man
B	and again you can only throw one this time
C	which one
A	not
A	oh a six you get
B	oh you fluky git
A	yeah
A	you have one more go
B	I'm gonna go
C	it's a lucky glow
B	four not a good throw
A	oh bloody hell
B	and then from North Africa
A	he really wants it go on roll a six
C	go on go on go on go on oh
A	what did you just do to my
B	yeah you may as well
C	sorry
B	obliterated him
A	yeah
A	you have loads of stuff going on here
C	you got it didn't you?
A	now you've got
B	yeah I've thinned out
A	he's got the continent I mean that gives you what? two you get the same as what I got for this with the whole of that
B	mm
C	I'll be back I'll be back

B	no
C	why not?
B	you don't hold any continents
C	I've got a card
A	you have to hold you have to hold
B	you haven't got a set
A	you have to hold a small continent
C	okay
A	do you attack him?
B	North Africa five

A	that's a bit rich isn't it?
B	go on then
A	is this like a special this whale?
C	six
A	does it do anything?
B	six
C	what does that mean?
B	I've won off you you can only throw two dice this time
A	and you're attacking again you're nearly look I mean you don't have much of a stronghold in in bloody Africa do you? is there any point?
B	you need to do something to get your armies together or you spread yourself too thin over the board
A	I've got a stronghold going on here
C	what do you suggest then?
B	you should have put your armies in better places when you started
A	we can start again we said we were gonna have twenty minutes I think I understand the game now I do so I reckon we could clear it and start again
B	do that?
A	I'm happy to if you are
C	okay

C	yeah
A	would you mind?
C	can I have a cup of tea break?

C	so he ate those and then we had a Ripple later on so it's like you go for weeks of not eating any chocolate and then you binge
B	we had the Ripple the next day didn't we?
C	oh then you got in went into Budgens and picked up the blooming cakes
B	the Belgian buns

B	and a power supplies are only a couple of quid though aren't they?
A	yeah I need to look into it I just haven't I don't even know where a guitar shop is in Brighton is it just a generic power supply then? it should just work on any kind of power supply?

B	mm
C	mm
A	and we don't get any more goes
A	any more players or anything?
B	no
A	isn't that right? we just do
B	you can forfeit your go and divide your countries by three and that's how many armies you get but
A	what do you mean forfeit my go?
B	and then you you count you count up your countries
C	then you don't have a go
B	and you divide it by three and that's how many armies you can get at the start of your go
A	oh okay cool
B	but then you don't get a go you just you can just build up your countries
A	okay but it's still worth doing
B	but you've still got you've still got places you can attack so
A	erm
C	it's very tactical isn't it?
A	oh definitely sorry is that not allowed?
C	no
A	I'm gonna take Eastern Australia

B	yeah or you can divide the your countries by three but then you don't get the go
C	okay I'm going to attack from Great Britain to Northern Europe
B	why?
C	why? cos I need the whole area
B	okay just thinking it might be easier to attack one with one army and rather than
C	yes
B	you attack the two
C	Western Europe is a good idea
A	alright no need to help her
C	okay we'll go for that route first
C	I need a bit of guidance
A	oh sorry she goes first
C	five
A	I really have to refer to you as your name every time?
C	mum mum mum
A	five
C	five
A	five
C	that's four
A	you're mistaken
C	you're gone be gone
C	can I do that?

A	we're getting there aren't we?
B	bloody Dutch not Dutch Danish

A	I've put a lot in Madagascar I can't really move them out
B	no
A	that wasn't a good idea
B	not really
C	Southern Europe from
A	they're just stuck there for the whole game
B	but I don't think you can move them about
C	Ukraine
B	I've never known you could
C	Southern Europe from Ukraine
B	well
C	so what I should freeze now then?
B	well I would
C	why?
B	cos even if you well even if you take that there's no chance of you getting Northern Europe anyway
A	I mean you're spreading yourself very thin aren't you? you've just got one everywhere
B	don't think you've got any
C	alright
B	you haven't got a continent yet
C	I'll have another card then thank you
B	you need to try and build up your Asia and try and get your greens
C	so I can't do any of that until I've got three cards?
B	no not really
C	oh
A	oh dear
C	unless I forfeit a go
B	yeah
A	so my go is this?

B	what? I was just waiting for Match of the Day to come on but you can turn it off
A	I'm gonna try again
B	okay
A	no there's no point though is there? I've weakened you
B	well you have but I've got five to come for holding that and I get two for that and I get seven armies next go
A	so I don't want you to hold that next go

B	that stopped me getting two extra armies yeah
A	and you get five for that
B	I still get five for that though
A	bloody hell
C	oh yeah yeah
A	but these are like stuck here though I don't understand
C	I know I know it's pointless
A	you'd think you should be able to like move one or something
B	well that's the where you tactically you have to put them in the right places to start with
A	is that right? at the beginning
C	whose go?
B	yours well you've sort of stopped?
A	oh no have I finished? erm

A	yeah
C	funny
A	it was quite funny
B	have you put your ten on yet?

A	yeah I bet
C	for you me we're novices
B	I have been playing it for probably thirty years
C	exactly
B	well forty years probably

C	we didn't get into it did we?
A	no
C	but whether we need to try it again
B	it's not my sort of thing
C	I don't know
A	regardless if you like Risk there's a Game of Thrones game very similar to this
B	oh really?
A	but erm
B	oh right
A	kind of more complicated than this you have a whole bunch of different wheels and like you have the throne and thing in like one there's a lot to it it's a lot more complicated than this but it's effectively the same thing you have a map and you're trying to control the different areas on it and they've built like expansions so you can get other boards that like add to it so you've got like
C	oh god
A	this
B	wow
A	board games today are insane like I've my friends bought me a Battlestar Galactica one it's crazy it's like a crazy it just shits on like old games it's really it's to a taken board games to a different level

A	I mean if you're interested in playing
B	we still do the old classics don't we?
C	yeah we do
A	I could bring it down
C	we do kind of
A	they're pretty good if you're thinking of buying a board game look up Fantasy Flight Games they've got a whole tonne of games and they're all really good quality and like
C	they're expensive though aren't they games?
A	they'll be about thirty quid for a board game
C	I know I know
A	and they're really quite complex though but I mean they take for hours to play
C	yeah
A	a bit like we just like cane whisky and just like play these board games recently
A	it's been a bit ridiculous
C	come on stop delaying I'm invading
A	oh is it me? where you invading? you haven't even
C	I'm invading Middle East
A	you haven't told me that
C	just announced it I did
A	go on then

A	I'm about to die I'm getting completely destroyed munched
C	Middle East India
B	see er hold on a minute

B	well if it was me?
A	yeah

B	oh man
C	oh I feel sickie again
A	yeah you've been feeling like that all day
B	got three
A	it's cos you've been eating chocolate
C	could be
A	decimation
C	I need an antihistamine
A	that's a vicious cycle that is
B	Northern Europe from Scandinavia
A	what did you get?
B	three
A	three
B	and again
A	six
B	better stop I guess
A	just one lone soldier altered his march there
A	whose go now? mum what do you collect?
B	nothing
A	yeah
A	of course I did
C	you horror child
A	oh
C	taking glee in your mother's downfall
A	of course
C	anyone want an antihistamine?
A	absolutely not
B	no thanks
A	unless they have some kind of effect
C	they do
C	right okay
A	doesn't seem to be much space for people on this boat it's all sails
A	yeah
C	who's tapping? someone's tapping
A	you're waiting bull crap was was rubbish wasn't it? cos he just destroyed you
C	I'm going to attack Scandinavia from the Ukraine
A	it seems oh I guess yes you're right it was just our way of laying him down but it was stupid we've just wasted loads of pieces didn't we?
C	yeah
A	you only need pieces on the borders
C	yeah
A	can we start again?
B	five and three
C	yes
A	did you take it?
C	yeah
A	you did it so you get your card
C	yeah I get my card
A	I'm just gonna spend the whole game fighting over West Africa
A	I'm sure
C	erm
A	as long as I get my two
C	so from here I can attack there?
B	Alaska
C	Alaska oh that looks
A	I mean this is completely missing out the Philippines where are the Philippines?
C	what about so it's only here I can?
A	where are the Philippines?
B	ain't this is the Philippines under here?
A	no that's Indonesia
C	I stop
A	maybe that's the Philippines but they've put it under as Indonesia
C	ta
A	I mean where's Malaysia? that should be Malaysia and half of Borneo is Malaysia
B	is this the
A	it's not
C	mm
A	Guernsey
C	stop
A	Sheppey Isles or whatever they are
B	half the
A	yeah
B	where are they then?
B	right do you get two?
A	me?
B	yeah
A	oh oh yeah yes I do right where's the strategic place to put them? where would you put them
B	erm probably on Indonesia
C	ouch fuck
A	why?
B	well I'd start building up from that direction
A	you just don't want me taking back Africa do you?
B	well no you or that
A	I mean I'm not gonna take the entirety of Europe with with bloody Indonesia
B	no but as soon as you've got that part of of the world you should have concentrated on keeping that protect
A	so as long as I don't lose this I haven't lost right?
B	no exactly yeah
A	and as long as I just keep building it up
B	and it's quite a strategic place cos it can only be attacked from one area and if you get onto Siam then that's always gonna be protected in every single game you're getting two points whereas this is a good base to have as well cos you can only be attacked from two sides
A	you just don't want me to take back Africa I feel
A	thirty-five of them and then I'm taking them
C	and you can never lose
B	if you take if you take Siam then move everything into Siam
C	or you could take Africa and Brazil
A	but if I love Siam
C	and make this your strong point
B	well I can do but I think if you do that
A	I tried to get in there
B	if you put if you put them two on Egypt then you might lose a couple getting into North Africa and then he can only move one in here all I'd get is this five and we just take it straight back again
A	it does seem to be the case but he's gonna take Africa off me isn't it?
C	well I was just testing to see if there was some you know
A	well I'm going for Siam with India
C	I is ready
A	oh really?
B	four
A	oh I'm sorry that was a childlike
A	where's this water come from?
C	it came from
A	I mean obviously alright
B	we played conkers didn't we? me and
C	you did
A	yeah but I
B	that's that's a that's two er yeah
C	that's it yeah
B	I caught
C	I told he didn't
B	oh that's not the
A	so you think move them all in I shouldn't leave at least one there?
B	no cos of what there's no point
A	oh yeah so I do leave one there
B	yeah
A	did I put two down somewhere? I did didn't I? I put it there right
A	that was accidental of course I don't know where they were
C	oh I don't know where they were either
A	presumably they where was that piece?
C	well I think there was two on that one
A	right and that that looks about
C	and there was two on that one
A	no no there was two there
C	are you sure? are you sure?
C	go for it then
A	alright
C	just do it
A	I'm going into East Africa into West Africa
B	North Africa
A	is that whatever it's clearly west
B	two and a one
A	that couldn't be worse couldn't
B	five and five
A	great

A	fucking hell
B	so the two you've gained from your last go you've now lost
A	yeah right
B	you know what I mean?
A	cheers

A	yes
B	yes
A	no I like this
C	nothing
A	no no no it was twenty wasn't it?
A	isn't that what you were saying? does that laugh mean no?
B	oh think it's seven
C	do does he get anything for three cannons?
B	no it's just one of each
A	do you know that he has been secretly drinking alcohol?
A	twenty-five percent alcohol
B	yeah
C	I saw it written obviously
B	nought point nought five I think I've had it
A	you'd have to drink so many of those
B	cor wouldn't you?
A	you'd get
B	you'd be ill
A	more drink drinking
A	oh right Africa's gone now well you try and take Madagascar you bloody try
A	it's not gonna happen

B	the Congo
A	Congo there's nothing in the Congo mate you don't wanna go there
B	six
C	cos the snakes
A	oh there's no point in rolling is there? there's a snake pit in the Congo
C	oh I thought that was gonna be a six then
A	I was hopeful
A	where to next
C	are you moving some into the Congo then?
B	yes I'm thinking about how many to move
C	do you need to go outside and let some wind out?
B	no
A	why?
C	he's going
A	oh yeah that's why I've put it there there was a reason you see don't want you taking Africa
B	and this if I take East Africa then that gives the
A	mm that was my plan see a long game I was thinking I knew that would probably be the last
B	at the moment they're just stuck there
B	you did you
C	taken and win
B	Egypt
C	I was like like that
B	got six and five
C	sixty-five
A	five and one
C	you lost Egypt?
A	I did yeah
A	well it's clearly a game of skill
C	well you know we know you've got hundreds there so just put a handful in
A	I was playing Chinese chess with dad today that was quite fun
C	were you? what's that then?
A	I recommend trying it erm it's like chess but it's not like chess you get some other pieces there's one called the cannon which jumps over other pieces it can
C	so is it a normal chess board?
A	it looks like the chess except there's something called the river in the middle and certain pieces can't cross the river and the king lives in the palace in a box and in the palace the king can only move like that way within the palace and he's got two ministers that can move diagonally within the palace it's basically the same but not it completely changes the game
B	same board?
A	yeah it looks pretty much the same except there's a river in the middle and a and a palace that everyone's got and there's a
A	so he's got like a Ipad version which is
C	oh okay
A	er much quicker
C	yeah
B	mm
A	I'd recommend playing it
B	East Africa
A	oh right
C	I've gotta learn normal chess first
A	Madagascar's coming the lemur army

B	oh
C	and really painful
A	no I didn't like that
C	so and they got stuck like that
A	I used to hate it when the teeth went round and then you couldn't get it back
C	oh it's horrible
A	and you're like it's horrible
C	it's horrible and you've got this tooth sticking like that
B	you can't stop turning it can you going like that
C	no it's awful
A	it's so long ago
B	oh dear
A	but it's like it really happens and when you're quite young
B	horrible memories
A	when does that start happening? how old are you when that happens?
C	and that's the easiest way to do
A	so
C	yeah well he's not and he's really disappointed
B	they're really strong on
C	yeah
B	I'm not surprised the amount of milk he drinks though
C	he is really disappointed at the moment
A	why? he wants them to come out
C	but I will do the same with him if you've got a wobbly tooth
A	why can't we have a third set of teeth? is that you know what I mean? get to thirty
C	yeah

A	just got all of the same cards
B	well what do you have? a set of three of the same as five then or something?
C	no no we'll carry on as we are

B	you can have twenty with three of the same
C	are we changing it now then? cos I want I want my

B	well another one what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna attack over there and then
C	oh thanks
B	I'll be able to attack on two fronts
C	yeah yeah just push forward take over the world
B	that's that's the idea that's the whole idea of the game
C	we're too weak we're not gonna survive
A	he's coming for me is he?
A	Jesus
C	so so you've gotta build up on here get your
A	put my ten there should I?
C	yeah definitely
B	erm North West
C	that's your only your only chance of survival is

B	what's that then? oh Western Europe sorry
C	oh
A	come on let me take him down

A	you keep rolling sixes
B	mm
A	there's a fourth dice up his sleeve
A	it's just unreal
B	er
A	I feel like the end is nigh
C	you've gotta save Australia
B	Kamchatka from Alaska
A	alright then Hitler
C	again
A	Genghis Khan
B	five and four
A	do you know on average Genghis Khan had that many children
C	six and one
A	that apparently the statistic is one in two hundred people in the whole world can trace their lineage back to Genghis Khan?
B	really?
C	oh gosh
A	one in two hundred so every one for every two hundred people out of the whole world can trace their lineage back to Genghis Khan
B	oh
C	bloody hell
A	now that statistic is skewed because in Europe it's not gonna be so high but in Asia it's gonna be really high but apparently he had that many children
C	wait a minute
A	one in two hundred people in the world
B	bloody hell
A	it's a pretty crazy statistic isn't it? I don't know how certain the statistic is but I heard it and I'm repeating it
B	two
B	two
C	what what are we doing?
B	I'm going to Kamchatka you've got one dice to throw and two to beat
A	bloody hell it's game over isn't it? once you take
C	that's what I mean you've gotta like really batten down the hatches
A	bolster up
B	six
A	I didn't see that
A	what was that?
C	I'm out I'm out
A	half of a six
C	yeah
A	he's crossed the narrow sea
C	oh he's moving in
A	Hitler arrives
A	oh right okay yeah I'll do
C	protect it
A	I'll do that
C	one of us has gotta stay in the game
A	only if you want it to go on forever
B	I do
C	just think of the taping
A	I don't think I've even see you lose one of these
A	what's the point in these bits then?
C	why haven't you used one yet?
A	oh really I'm gonna get an army of ten am I? as
C	you will need them if you start taking over the
A	Jesus
C	right whose go?
A	yours innit?
C	mine
B	yeah
C	mine
A	once
B	you got a set yet?
C	no you know I haven't
B	oh
A	you've haven't ever had one
C	kept that thank you
C	yeah that was rather
B	I meant a set of them
A	oh
C	I know what you meant
A	got all of Africa now he's got all of Europe
C	I need to get a country to get my card
A	all he needs is Asia
C	come on help me
A	you don't want this
C	what chance have I got?
A	I mean where is where is New Zealand?
B	that's fallen off innit? that's sort of down by
A	yeah it's just gone
B	Eastern Australia somewhere isn't it?
B	I thought it was down here and Tasmania's down here innit?
A	Tasmania's down there yeah
C	okay
B	I thought you thought it was over there
C	I'm sorry I'm sorry
A	oh
C	it's gonna have to be
A	no no no
C	no okay I can't
B	you can only throw one dice
A	take it back
C	right can I miss a go and regroup?
B	yeah
A	yeah you can do that yeah
C	yeah but I've got no no
A	but he hasn't got anything to come back at you with
C	yeah but I've got nothing there
A	just keep trying attack with this one attack with this one
C	no I can't
A	attack with that one
C	I need to regroup I think
A	no you can attack three times
C	would you regroup if you were me?
B	I would probably try to attack I would chance my arm
C	oh you're just
A	because he's got he's got nothing after that
C	you you no he's throwing me a curveball
A	though he's gotta build his
C	he was like he's trying to make me go for it so that I lose it and then he gets further in
B	you think I'm bluffing you
C	yeah
B	have you not got a set in here?
C	no you know I haven't
A	they're never very fun those things are they?
C	alright
B	do I'd probably and attack
B	so are you going for a one dice? I can throw two
C	it's not gonna happen
B	go on
B	what?
A	it's the wang one
B	one off you oh don't say that
B	one off you
A	which one?
C	oh why don't you take the one on the right?
A	oh
B	so you can also attack from Mongolia and Japan
A	yeah just do it twice just keep doing it
B	cool
C	I think I should have regrouped really
A	what would that have given you?
C	okay Mongolia to
B	yeah
A	which one was that one?
B	that's one off you
A	Mongolia?
C	right now I'm gonna go from
A	Kublai Khan is
C	Japan to
B	are you sure this is a good idea?
A	Coochie coo ne ne ne
C	just go go
B	Coochie coo
C	do it go
A	it's a wang eye
B	well it doesn't matter what I got do it
B	I can't lose to a one
C	oh
A	should have regrouped
B	good plan that
C	yeah I don't even get a card next time now
B	no
C	I might as well just keep going till I'm out
B	you can't attack anybody now
C	why?
A	well she's got Siberia
C	cos I've got
B	you
A	right
A	so this is my go? I'm gonna regroup
A	no no I'll have to I'll
C	have to get them all in to Australia
A	I get my two
B	you get your two
C	put them in Australia on there
A	why? surely I'm
C	cos he's gonna come attack him
A	yeah but I can protect this area can't I?
C	go on then try it try it try it
A	all this here is not doing anything
A	she won't listen to it I don't think got hours and hours of recording so
A	where do I go? I don't really wanna take the Middle East cos that just opens
C	so I'm doing some good there then
A	I guess I should attack Siberia because then it stops you from attacking me
C	I didn't
A	no but you might mightn't you?
C	I was being nice
A	it's
C	what's
A	erm
A	your luck's changed
C	I've got something coming on
A	nice you've been saying that for hours nothing's coming on aren't you
A	and erm I cease and desist that's er
B	we're done?
A	yeah let's have another card please don't be a cannon
B	I've got ten there I've got five there I've got five I've got three there and I've got two there
A	alright
B	so that's twenty-five
A	no need to rub it in
B	just done it again
A	still got a few moves before you get to me I'm gonna have an army of a hundred here waiting for you
A	I'm not sure if it was really necessary to put the shape of the country on here I mean
C	I hope
A	doesn't really help that much I don't
B	not really
A	I don't look at the shape and go oh which one is that one?
A	you look at the word don't you? I mean
B	yeah
A	it's a bit pointless
B	oh that's enough
A	I mean when was Venezuela that big? I mean there was never a Colombia and for a start the Darien Gap does not connect here it connects here
B	it might have done
A	it's just just all wrong well just well the land moved did it?
C	oh Darien Gap
B	the land's moved yeah
A	central
B	we used to be connected to Africa at one point weren't we?
A	I mean it was quite a while ago when is this
A	I mean before humans?
B	this is dinosaurs
A	it's not Pangea is it?
B	right
A	cos it looks like it it does look like there were dinosaurs maybe that's what this is maybe this isn't people but the ship's a little bit confusing
C	it's been underwater a while hasn't it?
A	got its its head stuck in the sand
A	have you ever seen a whale?
C	no pretty amazing I should think
A	it is quite amazing
B	what's going on over there?
C	well you've got your ten armies
B	five
C	you started to use the
A	it's a five
B	it's fives
C	you've used the biggies
A	it's doing well though it's in good condition isn't it?
A	I just think it would have
C	for a prehistoric
A	fallen apart but
B	it's pretty old
B	Middle East
B	from there wherever that is East Africa
C	I but it's me
B	yeah
C	I can defend
A	I mean
C	ten eleven twelve thirteen
A	he's just gonna keep going at you look at this
C	I can do ten I can defend fifteen armies
C	with my one army
A	with this little fella
B	one army
C	but then I'm
B	oh
C	I
C	what is it with me and one?
A	is this even fun for you
A	this taking us out systematically?
B	it's great
A	command and conquer
A	maybe I
B	no not yet
A	you're gonna take us out this round aren't you?
C	oh he's going innit?
A	I think it's game over
C	it's going
B	Yakutsk
C	it's going
A	just keep
B	five
C	bring all yours
A	one
C	into down there
A	yeah
C	oh no I'm changing dice
A	that's alright though
A	doesn't doesn't help much does it?
A	oh so that die is better
B	five again
C	five again
A	nice
B	pack it in
B	six
C	oh
A	oh you just needed to have good luck twenty more times
A	what next
B	it's I dunno seven eleven twelve
A	Jesus
B	the Urals
A	poor little peasants in the Urals
A	just like
B	six
C	oh
A	I took out one
C	you did it's a good way of doing it it's the only way we're gonna do it
A	I think this is it
B	Yakutsk
A	you've got the ground you're all done
C	I can have two can I have two?
B	you can have four yeah
C	you can only have one
A	right what with that?
C	yeah you've got an army of six
B	no I'm going from Yakutsk
A	well there's only really one person playing this game
A	we're just glorified die-rollers
C	six
A	nice taking him down
B	and again
B	six
C	one
A	I'm looking forward to collecting my two
B	Yakutsk
C	you're gonna have to put it on Australia
A	yeah I know
B	from Siberia
C	unless you're gonna defend here
A	it's unless I decide to go from here yeah
B	got five and two
A	and it'll leave you with nothing
C	oh god he's just
B	six
C	squeezing us out
A	six
C	excuse you
B	six
C	six what?
B	well I've got six
C	and what have I done? what we
B	what you
A	you're having rolls
C	what you after?
B	this one
C	five
A	close
C	I was close closer than one
A	much
C	what now?
B	Afghanistan
A	oh it's not my turn is it? just keep rolling the die
B	that one's
B	from
C	higher
B	from the Urals
A	I think I preferred the big where you put it down one by one at the beginning
B	five
C	I told you this dice was better
A	I shall try with a different dice
C	you never know our luck it might come in
A	come on
B	China
A	talking about China I get two
C	you can fifty soldiers
B	five and five
B	dear
A	how is this possible?
C	someone's knocking at the door
B	was that on on there?
A	no no
B	what was on there then?
A	nothing yeah it's probably that isn't it? I can see that there
B	China again six three
B	yeah
A	take you out
C	gotta fight back come on
A	there's no way that Afghanistan is invading China
B	six
A	it's just not realistic
C	come on
A	my heart's in it
B	yeah
A	you're not really to do much thinking here
B	well no
A	you're making it look tactical
B	I I've made a bit of a mistake
A	there's nothing tactical about it
B	and I thought all the
C	yeah
B	I need to get Yakutsk first but I run out of armies
A	oh yes so he's
C	oh
A	just prolonging the death isn't he? just
B	Mongolia
A	he's going back
B	five
B	Yakutsk
B	I'll have one
A	that was just
C	how can that be?
A	I don't know
C	how can I keep rolling one?
A	it's like playing Jumanji or something
B	yeah
A	some old dusty game with no end to it
A	and sort of some all of
A	as soon as we lose we're gonna get sucked into the game
C	we're gonna be stand up and marching
A	and with and
A	I mean definitely because I'd question reality you know what I mean?
A	you know everything that I thought was real would change so
B	India from Middle East
A	yeah I'd definitely freak I bet you'd freak too
C	would you run?
A	I don't know what I'd do I'd probably watch it for a bit and see what happens
A	wow that's bit weird I'd probably put something else in there before a finger a beer can or something you know what I mean?
C	I'd be like who's under the table what are they doing?
A	I'll let you stick your finger in first
A	right whose go is it then? what are you attacking
C	so what would you do if like it dragged me in? if I put my finger in and it started dragging me in would you pull me out?
A	oh then I'd run no then I'd run
A	I mean if you
B	then we'd put the beer can in
A	I mean if you started getting sucked into this board game what what would you do I mean genuinely?
C	well I couldn't do anything if I was sucked into it but I would hope you'd save me
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker C believes he/she would be rescued by speaker A if needed.	Entailment
A	I mean you being the the royal you everyone
B	we'd be out of here like a
C	shot
B	dunno
C	no I think I'd try and save you
A	you'd be like even if just her fingernails you'd be like she's a write-off that's it
B	that's it
A	we're done isn't it?
B	she ain't gonna make it
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker C likes saving people.	Neutral
C	I'd like I'd scream
A	what are we gonna do tie a rope around you? where are we gonna get a rope from? why do why would I have a rope?
C	yeah but you would just use your hands and you would pull me out
B	we've got a string we could probably hold onto the conker
B	yeah you could tie that onto my toe
A	that's no but that's what you'd have put in first the conker and the string not the finger
A	mine go on then
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B is disabled and has an artificial toe.	Neutral
B	this one
A	your die of death
B	six and five
C	four and a one
A	great one
B	back in the room
B	four and four it's not good
A	well it's gonna beat my one and a two
C	six and a two
[ANNOTATION]	Four and four is great according to speaker D.	Entailment
B	five
A	does anyone else get to play this game?
C	well last time no wonder we nearly
A	one
C	like had a row about it cos he didn't get to play
B	you just denied that to me didn't you?
[ANNOTATION]	People play a football match.	Contradiction
A	how? do you know what I mean I just
C	I don't
B	so I don't know what you did
A	so
C	I just kind of like had it all in a group or something and I wasn't going anywhere with it or something like that
A	alright
B	er now go to Siam
A	alright you're not gonna let me cash these in are you? that's not gonna happen
[ANNOTATION]	Siam is in Africa.	Neutral
B	well hopefully not
A	lovely
C	oh
A	shall I stop rolling the die?
B	Indonesia
A	sorry the boat's been cancelled
A	knock it over there
C	you were gonna keep Australia what happened?
A	six to one
C	yeah but you could have regrouped
A	when?
C	when
A	I haven't had a go
B	that's now nine on there
B	five well and a six
A	how many sixes have you rolled?
A	I just keep rolling threes
B	now now eight
C	oh man
B	six
A	this is it
B	this is the one
B	thanks
C	next time we'll whip his arse
A	don't think there's gonna be a next time I'm never playing that game again
C	didn't even get to use our cards
B	I know
A	and my cannons look at that
C	I think we need to google it I think
B	get the proper rules
C	yeah google it find out how many you get for
A	hang on a minute oh no I did get another one I just didn't have time to cash it in
B	yeah
A	that was it
B	you had another ten
C	you could have saved Australia
A	that was one of the least fun games I've ever played
B	when there's a lot of you you have mission cards
C	mission cards?
B	yeah so you had the
A	oh right you kept that bit out the game
B	conquer the well that's the only best thing if you play like with five or six people conquer completely the continents North America and Africa destroy all red armies
A	oh you get a mission?
B	yeah
A	that might have been easier rather than having to take half the whole world
B	well you can't really do it with only three of you playing it
A	it might have been just take over Australia
B	destroy the other armies and stuff
A	and then I would have won
B	Asia and South America
A	oh okay that
C	so how do you do your mission then?
B	well you have to do what it says
A	do what it says you read the card
B	destroy all black armies
C	no I
B	destroy all green armies
C	and what do you get if you do?
B	you win
A	but what if there's no green?
C	you win the whole game?
B	yeah so really it's best when there's six play people playing to to do that
C	oh god you have to do that when it's bigger
A	how many times have you played with six people at this game?
B	I used to play it all the time when I was kid
C	we'll play with
A	oh you did you get six people to play it?
B	yeah
A	that's quite a few friends
C	I used to do that with Monopoly
A	it's a terrible game Monopoly no I like that it was a good game I think it had been better had it been more even but
A	you know
C	should get
A	we didn't understand fully and we put our pieces in the wrong places
C	you'd know next time
A	you'd better hope that
A	you keep counting on this although if he's not here it might be a bit quiet if nobody else is around
C	I know
A	and it's just
C	god
B	is he saying he's not gonna come then?
A	if it's just us three again
C	well no cos he was talking about going to see

A	everyone else can duck out so why can't he?
C	no I can't I'd like him to be
A	no
C	that's why
A	I don't know really?
C	yeah
A	she can't be here for Christmas Day
C	fill the
A	you know what I mean? she's not gonna be here for Christmas Day
C	we can get some like stuffed kind of mannequins and just put them around the house
A	what about
C	she's er she's working till two and then she's cooking dinner for erm
A	why can't we just go there? why can't we cook for us or like we all just get a takeaway or something?
C	cos she hasn't got a blooming big enough house
A	yeah it's big enough
C	for us all
A	she's got a garden
A	stick a tent out there
C	they could come here
A	I don't blame them if they don't want to they don't really know you do they? certainly don't know me I think I met
C	he
A	I think so yeah he was at a wedding can't remember which wedding maybe your wedding or somebody else's wedding one of your weddings don't remember which one
C	no he wasn't there
A	he was definitely at a wedding
C	was it
A	did he go to
C	no
A	it wasn't
C	really?
A	I was sitting outside having a drink with erm with
C	no
A	he's he was put a but whose do would this be then?
C	that was our wedding
A	I'm pretty sure it was then
C	and you put bloody
A	yeah
C	aftershave down his back
C	of course I did
A	brotherly thing to do isn't it?
C	maybe
C	I wanted it to be
A	no that's not gonna happen is it? that's alright where's where's
C	I've no idea
A	no
C	could find out they're probably with their mum
C	they'll be at home with the kids
A	not very popular are we this part of the family?
C	no
A	nobody wants to be with us
C	the trouble is it's like we can't get
A	just leave one of them behind
A	don't need the newest one
A	yeah
C	he's walking now
A	is he?
C	yeah he was walking at eleven months
A	well done
A	know what I mean? pretty clear isn't it that
C	oh you're twitching my legs again
A	if they're walking at eleven months they're obviously gonna be a genius?
C	no
A	he could have a growing spurt and
C	no it doesn't
A	and be all gangly and like
C	yeah totally
A	can't kick the ball around
C	totally
A	I find it's
C	they're just proud
A	and just like well it doesn't really matter does it? until they're like if they're good at something when they're about fifteen or sixteen maybe they'll be good at it when they're older
C	yeah yeah
A	but if they're good at it when they're five I mean maybe if you got him playing the trumpet now and he
C	mm
A	persisted with it
C	mm
A	for the next fifteen years then yeah maybe he'll be good but I'm not saying it's a bad thing
C	takes a lot of no takes a lot of erm
A	it's definitely good to pay interest in in in in your children and to
C	a lot of dedication and a lot of practice
A	and to erm get them doing all that kind of stuff go
C	to to be
A	everyone seems to be well into their children
C	extra good at something
A	oh my child's doing this at four and like it doesn't mean shit
C	yeah but that's cos you haven't got children and you've not gone through that experience at the moment
A	everyone thinks it's great their child's doing something everyone's child is gonna be good at something at four
C	yeah
C	I think it's just erm
A	I mean I'm not gonna lie
C	but as you say in another five years' time he might be totally fed up with it and doesn't wanna know
A	yeah yeah
C	but erm
C	mm
A	and when they grow they get really gangly and they can't like control their limbs properly
C	mm
A	so he could go through a massive growth spurt at like ten and then be like
A	does he reckon? yeah
A	yeah yeah
C	but erm he's certainly grown he's not the smallest in his class by any means he's doesn't look any different to any of the other children now
A	no
C	but
A	I didn't think he'd grown that much in two years when I came back
C	yeah I think that does make a difference doesn't it?
A	definitely had I not seen him at all for two years
C	yeah yeah
A	I reckon he'd seem bigger
C	yeah
A	but I guess because I'd just seen him on Skype a couple of weekends before
C	walking in and yeah
A	it's been like
C	yeah
A	the outcome
C	yeah
A	it's the same as
C	it is it is a bit like that isn't it?
A	definitely looks older in the face oh he's looking old now isn't he?
A	he's
C	oh god he's aged
A	in his fives
A	it's crazy to be five
C	I know
A	you know what I mean? you're five years old
C	I say to
A	mm
C	yeah
A	it takes him a long time at the same time at the same time you're like well he's only five well like it takes them until they're like twenty
C	and then on the in the other breath you're thinking
A	to actually get a head on their shoulders
C	how the hell did he get to five? where did that five years go?
A	yeah where did five years go?
C	kind of thing
A	well it takes him a long time to be independent
C	mm
A	as animals go you know I mean gazelle are up and running like immediately
C	he did make us laugh what was it? he was he was giving it all out in the garden with his friends playing football and kind of like you know doing the kind of walk cocky kind of walk and then he they go home and he comes in and goes can I watch Peter Rabbit?
A	yeah well he's five
C	I know it was kind of like he was acting all big and tough out in the garden
A	he's he's been alive for five years alive
C	mm
A	alive that's it like prior to five years ago he didn't exist
C	I know
A	where it didn't happen it's weird
C	it is really crazy
A	very strange
A	and the you know what I mean?
A	and nowadays
C	you wouldn't want them to at eight though
A	no I'm not saying you wanted them to but they can like if you wanted them to and they can
C	if you were sitting here with your son
A	I don't know
C	you'd be thinking
A	I think eight years would be enough really
A	I don't think we need them any longer than that
C	it's very good if you haven't got any
A	I mean eight years is a hell of a long time as well to be doing the same thing you know what I mean? eight years so eighteen years and then even then you're just no I mean
C	twenty-eight years
A	took you twenty-four years to get rid of
A	and he might come back yet
C	he went and came he went and came back
A	twenty-
C	no
A	they could stay with you forever
[ANNOTATION]	Person A is going to dance	Contradiction
C	that's true
A	that's a long old commitment
C	it is
A	I can't make that kind of commitment okay at the minute I can't even stay in the same place for more than a year so how am I gonna commit? I literally have not lived in the same house for more than a year for the last ten years so
C	well you wouldn't need to would you? not to begin with
A	well I'm not gonna move schools with them every few years I mean that's gonna be terrible
C	no no exactly but to begin with they don't go to school till they're four do they?
A	I can't move them around anyhow
[ANNOTATION]	Person A is going to have a sandwich	Contradiction
C	well I no you couldn't you couldn't
A	it's a bit stressful on the child though isn't it? if not with me it would be a bit difficult trying to move into a new property and trying to make do with not having very much but having a child as well it's
C	bloody hell you're not ready for a child no way
A	no no won't ever be not mature enough
C	you're just not there yet
A	yet as if I'm gonna be there
C	well you might be
A	not sure if I will you know what I mean?
C	and you might find that
[ANNOTATION]	Person C had forgotten about the social security	Contradiction
A	I might not be
C	erm my no you might not be but if you when and if you did you'd probably be like oh my god anxious and Jesus Christ and all of this but when that child comes and you hold that child in your arms it will just blow your mind
A	it's game over isn't it after that?
A	well I dunno if I think about it that way now why wouldn't I think about if I had a child?
A	I feel like my man
C	why is he gone?
A	cos he's gone isn't he?
[ANNOTATION]	Person A think he is gone because he was not there	Entailment
C	he's just committed in other areas at the moment
A	I mean
C	he'll be there and he'll come back
A	in my for me he's gone he's not gone for himself just for his friend but
C	no no but I mean er friendship-wise he's just
A	well I mean for the uni period it's man down isn't it?
C	he has priorities
A	you're not gonna he's not gonna come to the gatherings
C	oh that's true yeah
A	or anything like that and he's not gonna be you know he can't come and visit me wherever I'm living or anything like that it's man down game game over he's moved into a different stage of life and that's it
C	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Person C doesn't like ant commitment	Contradiction
A	they're gone now
C	but it but
A	he's moved into the adult realm of you know
C	mm
A	having kids all his
C	it's not the adult realm is it? it's just that he's changed direction
[ANNOTATION]	Person C think having kids is not that much adult realm	Neutral
A	well give him a year or two
C	not single
A	and all of his friends will be people that have children
C	mm
A	I'm pretty sure
C	mm
A	he's not gonna hang around with people that don't have kids
C	why would you not? why would you lose your friends just because they don't have children? it just means
A	because they're not on the same wavelength as you are they? they're not
C	yeah but that's nice to have friends with other kind of interests and stuff isn't it?
C	you don't always wanna talk baby talk and you know
A	no I mean well if your baby gets older if you're still talking about babies when your baby's eight
C	mm
A	bit stupid isn't it?
C	I mean yeah of course you mix with people parents and stuff from their school and stuff
A	just from my observations most people that have children tend to hang out with other people that have children
C	mm
A	because you end up going you know you take your kids to the parties and then you meet the parents
C	mm mm
A	of the kids that have the parties you know?
C	it's the way that you can actually get out and socialise
A	yeah and you know  your mates don't wanna come round anymore if you're not gonna be cracking open the wine you're gonna be cracking out the cafetière you know what you know what I mean?
A	and your you'll be putting the child to bed at eight o'clock and you've gotta be quiet there's no more dancing around in the living room at two in the morning it's not gonna happen
C	or showing your hairy bum
A	no
A	it's not gonna happen so it's man down man down
C	mm it's life for some
A	most
C	well you and
A	most
C	might be different mightn't you?
A	well certainly the people we know will be different I've got good friends now that I'm pretty sure aren't gonna have children
C	what about
A	not the way they talk neither of them want children erm
C	mm mm
A	so
C	does
C	mm
A	see it
C	well maybe they just haven't finished their journey at the moment
A	see life a bit differently
C	mm
A	the problem is your
C	and maybe the other
A	your biology isn't it?
C	and
A	it doesn't matter if you come to that term most of
C	but then also I was just gonna say the older you get and the more you are able to do you then it's hard to give up on that isn't it?
A	yeah
C	because you know that you'd have to settle down and you'd have to not travel quite as much and
A	there's no way I could have a child now
C	it's a huge commitment
A	cos I'd resent it can you imagine if you resented your own child?
C	no
A	it must be horrific
C	mm
A	like I couldn't do that to another living being I couldn't if there's a risk that I'm gonna resent my child
C	so if
A	I hope she'd have an abortion to tell you honestly
C	really?
A	yeah
C	would you leave that as her decision?
A	I mean
C	yeah and because emotionally it would affect her more
A	but I mean it's quite a big decision
C	yeah
A	I don't think just because we have sex that I should have to commit to having a child for the rest of my life
C	mm
A	I don't think that's very fair erm I think it should be er sixty forty split personally of course it should weigh slightly more on the lady's side
C	mm
A	but
C	mm
A	the fact of the matter is pretty much in this day and age if the woman wants to have the child we're screwed
C	mm
A	and we've gotta pay for it for the rest of our lives
C	mm
A	that's not very fair is it?
C	mm
A	just cos you don't wanna have an abortion
C	mm
A	I mean it's a fairly straightforward procedure that pretty much most people have I know it's not nice and you shouldn't have to go through it but
C	what do you mean most people have? most people don't
A	don't they? most of my friends have but I guess maybe I'm with friends that are of those kind of people
C	clearly
A	yeah
C	your
A	yeah
C	really?
A	yeah
C	when did that happen?
A	when she was about twenty
C	with you?
A	no that wasn't with me it was just before she met me so maybe a year before she met me so maybe like seventeen eighteen
C	oh god
A	not with me no erm I'm probably infertile as far as I know
C	does she say that as in kind of oh my god if I fell pregnant I'd get rid of it?
C	mm mm
A	and it was just sort of
C	so it kind of made you realise that actually you know
A	no I mean if if you think it's gonna happen and and you're like wow we might have a child
C	yeah
A	then go for it have a child
C	yeah yeah
A	but if you think it's gonna happen and it scares the shit out of you and you're just like this is the worst thing that could possibly happen right now
C	mm mm
A	I mean we we like stopped touching each other for a bit you know what I mean? just until it was certain and all that kind of stuff so
C	mm
A	erm and we stopped the implant went out of date and we stopped trusting it after that even though it's been working she hasn't had a period in years years
C	mm
A	she just doesn't have them on er on the contraceptive
C	on this implant?
A	erm she's this is the second implant she's had erm and they last for a couple of years
C	is that what's supposed to happen with this implant?
A	no it's varied you can do a
C	oh okay
A	a variety of things
C	yeah
A	erm about ten percent of people don't have a period and she's in that category
C	okay
A	erm so
C	does she still get the moods up and down kind of thing?
A	no she's been lucky
C	so she's pretty kind of like levelled out?
A	yeah so she's pretty worried now she's just had it removed it's all gonna you know put on weight get moody do all that kind of stuff so
C	she's had it taken out now?
A	yeah yeah it was taken out last week
C	so when does she get another one put in then?
A	she's not we er we don't want her on it particularly if she doesn't have to be on it so we're not we're just using condoms really
C	well that's risky then innit?
A	I mean isn't that what most people do?
C	well what's the percentage of a condom? is that like
A	provided you use it correctly it's ninety-nine point nine percent sure
C	oh okay
A	I mean they put spermicide in the things so provided you use it it doesn't break or anything like that it should be fine shouldn't it?
C	and then if it breaks you get the morning after pill
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	just don't really want her keep pumping herself with the hormones
C	yeah yeah
A	you know what I mean?
C	might actually help her skin as well if she comes off it
A	yeah yeah
C	mind you I didn't notice her skin was bad at all
A	no?
C	no
A	it comes and goes
C	yeah
A	it's pretty constant it comes and goes she she'll cover up with makeup if for er which I don't really like cos I think there's a vicious cycle of putting on makeup causing spots then putting on makeup
C	yeah
A	I try and tell her not to do it which she didn't the only time that she's ever not was when we were travelling for an extended period but she still had spots but the problem was I tried to tell her we were in a dirty country
C	yeah yeah
A	not being that clean
C	yeah
A	if you came off of it and stopped using it and we were clean
C	yeah
A	then I think you'd be alright
C	yeah
A	it was but whatever maybe the implant hasn't helped but erm
C	mm
A	if I had a
C	mm
A	if she I don't
C	she wouldn't want to have a child without you wanting it anyway
A	oh if she can you imagine the scenario? I don't want a child she has one anyway
C	mm
A	that child is gonna have the shittest life ever
C	mm
A	I mean maybe I stay with her and then resent my own child for the rest of my life
C	mm mm
A	what kind of scenario is that?
C	mm
A	she'd have an abortion I'm pretty sure
C	mm
A	I wouldn't force her into it but I guess through how she knows how I am I guess that does force her into it a little bit a little bit
C	mm mm
A	but I think she feels the same but obviously she doesn't like the process so
C	mm
A	but it's a fairly modern thing I mean quite a few people do it you should not treat it as a form of contraception of course
C	no
A	but if the worst happens then you know what I mean?
C	I I kind of understand if it happens you know accidentally and it happens and that's that but for it to happen repeatedly I just don't understand
A	what happen repeatedly?
C	for for women to have
A	to have numerous abortions?
C	yeah
A	no okay
C	I don't understand that at all
A	well then they're using it as a form of contraception aren't they?
C	yeah
A	they're just being lazy and just like doing whatever
C	and I don't agree with it being done later on when you think how quickly the baby forms
A	no when they're older but the baby knows nothing
C	that's not the point I just
A	absolutely nothing
C	just don't agree and how quickly the baby becomes a baby and rather than a foetus
A	until it breaths it's not living
C	oh
A	part of life is respiration we argue that there are seven life processes to life and until it starts breathing
C	so when you see a scan and see a baby and inside a lady and
A	doesn't know it doesn't know doesn't know
C	but well that's not quite true because if you look the the erm weeks and months
A	it has no knowledge of itself it has no language it has no experience in the world
C	but it hears it hears its parents' voices
A	it can feel it can hear but it's not gonna know it's dying is it? it's not gonna be in pain or anything like that
C	oh I don't wanna talk about this anymore
A	it's not gonna be in pain is it?
C	of course it'll be in pain
A	the it'll just die I mean
C	oh let's not talk about it
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker C doesn't mind talking about it.	Contradiction
A	okay but I mean it's like saying when you
C	mm yeah yeah yeah yeah but
A	it's all very one-sided because it's human
C	mm
A	I mean it hasn't even been born yet
C	no I know you don't
A	I mean it's called birth you're born otherwise we would start our age at when  you're conceived otherwise I should be an extra nine months older if I'm really
C	do you know I find it quite sad that you don't remember anything from when you're kind of like before three?
A	it seems a bit of a shame yeah it seems a bit of a shame
C	all the
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A has been born with in vitro fertilization.	Neutral
A	how much effort when you look around a parents' to see how much effort they put in
C	yeah
A	and then
C	and learning and
A	the kid just kind of forgets that don't they? yeah
C	cuddles and you know all the the laughter and
[ANNOTATION]	The kid forgets about its birth.	Neutral
A	they don't forget though it it must it contributes to their who they are and it contributes to their
C	yeah of course and their security and all of that how they feel but
A	and their love and their feel of you know so it definitely does they have a memory they just don't remember specifics
C	yeah
A	so if you think about that if a baby if you can't remember up to three years how are you conscious at three months?
C	mm
A	what do you consider too late then?
C	well what is the abortion now?
A	I don't know
C	is it twenty is it twenty-four weeks?
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A rember something from his/her birth.	Neutral
A	I don't know
C	or whatever that is I think it should be reduced by a couple of weeks
A	mm one of those
C	yeah
A	call you a religious nut don't they?
C	why religious?
A	if you so you'd rather that child grow up in a shitty home and have a shitty life
C	no no
A	for the whole of its life
[ANNOTATION]	Abortion is a very religious matter.	Neutral
C	no
A	than
C	no
C	no I just
A	cos that's what's gonna happen
C	well that's why they haven't reduced it then
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker C thinks he/she knows why they haven't reduced it.	Entailment
A	or should it go into adoption?
C	no
A	should it just go be born because what's the alternative here? if you're saying they shouldn't adopt they shouldn't abort it what happens to these child
C	I just think nowadays when I know that there are circumstances where people just ignore it and they're too afraid to admit that they're expecting or whatever and then when they do it's late and blah-di-blah I understand all that but also on the other hand there's so many of these pregnancy test things that show right from the very beginning that whether they're positive or not
A	so are you saying then that it's your responsibility to take these tests early and
C	yeah
A	constantly and frequently so if you're in a sexual relationship then what you need to be taking this every couple of weeks?
C	no no but if like you're using condoms and it splits
A	cos how do you know? but what about if it hasn't split but something's happened or it's was defective
C	well you wouldn't know would you?
A	or there was a little hole in it so to back that up then you have to be taking it every two weeks you need to take a pregnancy test
C	yeah
A	cos otherwise how are you gonna know?
C	mm
A	how are you gonna know?
C	you're not are you?
A	and I mean are you gonna take every used condom and fill it up with water
C	and I mean a month's gonna go by anyway four weeks gone
A	just to check? I mean what are you gonna it perhaps it's not that easy to tell I don't know
C	mm
A	as far as I know the statistic's pretty high that they're safe
C	mm
A	it's improper use of them that is bad
C	yeah yeah
A	it's people not changing them you know what I mean?
C	mm
A	it's people not like keeping it on or something that's
C	mm
A	so no I don't know
C	taking risks
A	yeah
C	mm
A	we try and be as safe as possible but
C	mm
A	when we go abroad again I'm sure she'll go back on it or on the pill
C	mm mm
A	cos she'll feel like she has to but
C	mm
A	we discussed it and decided that
C	what's the long-term? did the did the doctor kind of say you know if you've been on a while it will take you blah-blah-blah?
A	doctors are shit they're terrible what do they know? nothing we've put all this weight into doctors and then you go to to them with an actual problem and they have no idea they have no idea
C	yeah just general practitioners aren't they?
A	they just say oh
C	what?
A	if that is the case it's
C	what?
A	it's because children are staying indoors playing
C	what?
A	computer games if that's the case that's what she said
A	yeah that's what she said so we're seeing a lot of children coming in nowadays with these kind of things well do I look like a child that's not getting enough sun? is that your your answer? I'm coming to you saying I have hip pains and knee pains she didn't even touch me
C	that is ridiculous
A	or have a look at me or anything she just said are you getting enough sun? I said yes I've been living in a sunny country she said oh I don't know then that's the doctor's opinion
C	and that's it? so it's not kind of like right well we're we'll take some tests and
A	and she said your you might need to come in for a scan but I said erm she said you need to come in when it's hurting
C	mm
A	they're there to prescribe the drugs that have been sold I don't trust them at all I'm not saying that there aren't amazing doctors out there
C	yeah
A	who are very knowledgeable
C	mm
A	but I think in general
C	mm
A	they go through a system where
C	you need to go oh yeah they do and they'll they'll push the pills before they do anything else
A	yeah oh take this er antidepressant
C	mm yeah
A	take that
C	try this anti-inflammatory and then come back to me in four weeks if it's
A	and they have no knowledge of nutrition whatsoever you know if she'd have turned around to me and said oh have you looked into glucosamine sulphate? or
C	look for erm what about like these
A	nothing nothing nothing to do with nutritional health
C	Chinese health doctors or something where they do
A	yes
C	like natural remedies and things? is it worth maybe going and seeing
A	erm
C	they've got one in
A	I felt my joints have been a bit better since I've come home so
C	it would be interesting to see
A	but I need to tell you honestly I haven't been hitting the gym I haven't been lifting weights I haven't been running I haven't been doing these kind of things so I don't I there's so many variables
C	mm
A	it's very difficult to tell
C	mm mm
A	what is causing anything was it the water in Korea? I it's gone away now but I was having terrible dry eyebrows
C	yeah last time I saw you
A	and dry scalp and like itchy beard was it the water in Korea? what what is it?
C	yeah yeah
A	what's causing these things?
C	oh
A	don't know
C	do you need any more shampoo?
A	erm not at the moment no
C	okay
A	probably around Christmas we will
C	okay
A	we've got a big Tresemme and a big something else at the minute
C	cool
A	yeah but thank you anyway
C	I've got some when you next need it anyway
A	your Avon lady
C	I don't mind this is fine
A	so I mean what what do you think then? if
C	no no obviously it would have to be something that you both decided it's gotta be a decision between the two of you hasn't it?
A	but what if she says I wanna keep it?
C	oh god if she said I wanted to keep it then you'd have to either say to her well
A	that's the only choice really isn't it?
C	yeah
A	to be the honourable person
C	yeah
A	and then you end up
C	well you couldn't walk away from your child could you?
A	but you know what would happen though we'd end up divorcing
C	mm
A	and splitting up and the child would have a crappy upbringing and it would just be crap wouldn't it? why should I put a child through that?
C	well at the end
A	just because
C	it wouldn't be your final decision though would it?
A	maybe it would be better to split up if she really wants to have the child
C	mm mm
A	and then she can find somebody that does actually wanna look after a child
C	mm I was gonna say that maybe you'd split up like straightaway
A	but then you're putting an ultimatum on them aren't you? you're saying unless you have an abortion I'm leaving you and that that looks terrible
C	yeah I know I know
A	to everyone
C	well it's not about everyone anyway it's about the two of you
A	what about if you said okay well let's have the child but adopt it? immediately put it into a loving family of course you can't get rid of this baby you believe that you you
C	yeah
A	you shouldn't end this life
C	yeah
A	but we can't I don't want it
C	yeah
A	and if you think about it you don't really want it but the problem is that the hormones that you start producing tell you that you do want it
C	yeah yeah
A	cos it
C	yeah
A	you'd wanna have it
C	yeah
A	but even though for the last ten years you haven't wanted to have it
C	well let's hope you're never put in that position until you want to be
A	I hope not a very weighty thing and what do you do? just abstain from having sex just you know don't do these things because of the the risk?
C	no it's a big part of your relationship isn't it?
A	part it's not the be-all and end-all but it's it's a part of your relationship
C	no of course it isn't but it it unites you and you know in a in a different way to being united
A	well it's a core human need we need to be touched
C	exactly
A	we need to be sensual we it's just like eating or doing like these other things
C	yeah exactly
A	you need it
C	yeah
A	it really is
C	not unless you want to
A	it scared the crap out of us when we thought
C	mm
A	we might be
C	how the hell would you deal with it? yeah
A	well because it really makes you start practically thinking about it you know like god we'd have to go back and what? live in England and get a job and
C	mm
A	and that's it is it? just just
C	I just think naturally you wouldn't because you would become accustomed to the fact it would take you a while to get your head round it but
A	what if you don't like children?
C	yeah but your child is different to everybody else's children
A	everybody says that
C	mm
A	it's everyone says that it's I don't think it's true I think it's something that not everyone but some people convince themselves
C	but you don't you do not dislike children
A	mm
C	you're good with children
A	I'm good with children but it's an act
C	really?
A	I don't yeah I don't
C	well it seems very natural
A	because I don't have to be around them a long time I worked with children I spent quite a considerable time with children I don't really like children they quite massively inhibit on my ability to do the things that I want to do I like being
C	mm
A	they're very very very tiring
C	but I think that is the same as
A	extremely tiring and all-consuming
C	anybody that hasn't got their own children
A	but that seems a bit
C	so it's
A	bad isn't it? that you can only care really truly about your own children you can't care about other people's children
C	no it just changes you it just changes you when you have your own children you then
A	and you're shaping him
C	bond yeah from conception to birth and onwards
A	but that bond has to build doesn't it? what if that ante what is it called? antenatal depression or something doesn't go away?
C	yeah yeah
A	what if that you have that and it doesn't end and some some women have that don't they?
C	yeah yeah yeah
A	they actually don't love their child for the first few years
C	yeah
A	and that's fair because you can't just expect to love something immediately because it's yours
C	yeah
A	you have to spend time doing it and having them yet it's different for you you're obviously a very
C	I do think when you're expecting and you have a baby you think oh my god how the hell am I gonna love it? I remember thinking with
A	does it shock you then that I don't like children?
C	I'm surprised
A	the problem for me is
C	it's very rare for a man to have that overpowering feeling to want babies and be around children and all of that it's more the woman that would have that feeling and then it grows with a man
A	I just feel like when you have a child you end up spending most of your time around children and I really enjoy
C	adult company
A	intelligent conversation not
C	mm mm
A	the conversation with children
C	mm
A	I find it quite tedious I I can do it for a while and I you know
C	mm mm
A	I think I am good at it
C	mm
A	but it's a bit of an act it's not you know
C	well all parents like to get back to being adults though
A	I find them tiring
C	mm
A	like they're really tiring
C	oh god yeah
A	and that's just to be around a child for a couple of hours I can't imagine doing what you're doing and I can't
C	no but
A	if I were to have a child now it would be ridiculous
C	being a parent is like
A	are you cold?
C	it's something that you learn
A	no of course
C	I mean obviously I worked with children before having them so I have got that love of children anyway hadn't I?
A	and I grew up with
C	I always wanted children
A	all sorts of other people's children around me
C	yeah you did and maybe that's put you off
A	maybe
C	but then you also had playmates you also had people to play with children
A	yeah but I think
C	but maybe you didn't wanna share it
A	no I mean I didn't I didn't I never that I remember I never grew up thinking god I don't want these people around
C	mm
A	I don't remember having a problem with sharing
A	it was just
A	or having a problem with
C	no
A	having children around or any of that kind of stuff just
C	you know she's kind of like is there something wrong with me? am I weird?
A	mm
C	I don't want children
A	it's a bit strange maybe because of the life that you pursue but if you look statistically
C	mm
A	when you have a an MA it drops again
C	mm mm
A	and then when you have a a PhD it drops massively again
C	yeah yeah
A	the percentage of people that have a PhD and have children is very low compared to the people that don't
C	yeah yeah I can believe that
A	it seems that if you pursue education you don't tend to do it
C	well you've gone the edge er you've gone the academic route as opposed to the family
A	but maybe it's as you become because you've postponed it a bit you start to develop these ideas of what a child should have a what a child a kind of environment that a child should be brought up in and then you start to look at yourself and think I can't provide that
C	mm
A	I can't do that and therefore how can I do that? I guess a big part of why I don't want children is because if I were to have a children I'd wanna give it everything and I want
C	what is the perfect everything?
A	well I mean there is no perfect of course there isn't but
C	and what is giving them everything?
A	well I think a parent should be erm I think a parent should be educated enough to be able to teach their child important things simple things I think a parent should know how to cook quite well and I think a parent should know how to manage money very well and in and be social and and er numerous attributes like er loads of things that
C	mm mm
A	I guess I see those attributes and think oh I should have X amount of money in the bank before I have a child
C	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Person C think Person A is right that they have do it before having a child	Entailment
A	and I think I should be able to provide it for these things and if it wants to go on a school trip I can afford for it to go on a school trip
C	mm okay
A	and these kind of things do you know what I mean?
C	mm
A	there's a whole a whole plethora of attributes that I feel are necessary before you have a child I mean I'm of such a a liberal mindset that I actually personally would change the whole structure
C	I know you would yeah you've told me before
A	I don't think that children should spend most of their time with other children which is basically how most children are nowadays in society they spend the majority of their time learning from other children but what can other children teach them apart from how to interact with other children? they should be spending most of their time with adults and then they should also be spending most of their time not just with a couple of adults but with a wide variety of adults that are able to teach them
C	but isn't that what a family is? aunts and uncles and
A	yeah you need a good family network so then again I look at my own life and think well you know I don't have a good family network I don't have
C	well you
[ANNOTATION]	Person C think a family is important	Entailment
A	a lot of people around I mean er the only way it would work is what? if I came and lived down the road from you
C	mm
A	because then you'd be there and you'd be able to help out so if I don't have that network around me
C	mm
A	and I don't have these other adults I mean it probably sounds crazy but I personally think we should
C	but also it's freedom isn't it? otherwise you're going back to China and er places like that where they you er er have they have rules that you can only have isn't it? isn't it that you can only have
A	I mean that wasn't as it was a rule but the only rule that really existed the only way that they enforced that rule was that they said if you have more than one child
C	mm
A	you have to pay for everything for that child
C	oh right okay
A	that was how they did it
C	yeah
A	they didn't say you can't have a child they just said you can only have one child that the state will pay for
C	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Person C is not satisfied with having just one child	Neutral
A	if you want another child
C	which was fair enough really
A	you need to be yeah I mean I don't have I don't see a problem with that
C	mm
A	the problem is that you then get mm all sorts of negative effects where they're leaving dead babies in the side of streets
C	oh my god
A	and all this kind of stuff and in because of Chinese society the male carries on the family name they don't want females and all this kind of stuff so it's like
C	oh god yeah
A	so it you need a whole social construct reformed for that a system like that to work but I'm not against that I think that's how it should be and quite often and I'm not talking about you or or people in our family but there are a hell of a lot of people that are having children that probably shouldn't be
C	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Person think is thinking about some families are not suitable for having baby	Neutral
A	and there are a hell of a lot of people that probably should be having children that aren't
C	mm
A	so I don't see why we just what I my perfect system would be
A	you don't you don't have a child
[ANNOTATION]	Person A think Person C dont have a child	Neutral
C	mm
A	like in a in the future nobody has children children are created and they're created without defect genes without all this kind of stuff
C	yeah yeah
A	you know what I mean? you make a child
C	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Person C agree with a	Neutral
A	so none of these genetic defects are passed on and then they are placed into the care of people temporarily
C	mm
A	you know
C	mm
A	and when we don't have a
C	mm
A	I've said to you before I don't agree with education er how it is how can I give my child up to the state
C	mm
A	in four years in and then just say alright it's up to you to educate my child? even though I'm a teacher and I'm educated and I'm qualified to impart my wisdom on my children
C	well you have another option there don't you? you you teach them yourself you take them out of school and you teach them yourself
A	no no cos how are you gonna afford that? what am I gonna be rich?
C	mm
A	er you need to be rich to do that
C	mm
A	so I don't have that option I'd love to have that option yeah brilliant
C	mm
A	so that option doesn't actually exist it's not a real option it's only a real option for people that have a lot of money
C	mm
A	so all of these
C	well you're a lot erm what's the word?
A	probably just analyse it too much
C	people don't think
A	there's definitely a part of me definitely that I think I could be a good father
C	you'd be a great father
A	X X and X were met
C	mm
A	and society was changed in this way so that you know what I mean? but it's not it doesn't exist now
C	but you might find a country that you do you know you think okay well I can I can bend a bit on that but I quite like the way they do this and the way they do that you might think you know it's not quite as
A	I haven't heard of one yet
C	I want it to be but
A	haven't heard of one yet and and again the problem is if you never have children you're missing out on such an amazing wonderful experience that everyone goes on about all the time
C	do you feel like that a little bit? do you feel like er you know what are we missing out on if we don't have children?
A	oh definitely and you've always got this thing as well that every person that's had a child is gonna look down on you and go you just don't know cos you haven't had a child and that I find frustrating
C	why would that bother you?
A	it bothers me because it's like saying I can't possibly have any idea of what it's like to drive a car just cos I've never driven one but I've been in cars all the time and I've been around people that drive cars I've spoken to people that drive cars I've watched people drive cars and there's a fairly simple mechanic to driving a car
C	but then you could turn round and say but you don't know what it's like to travel all these beautiful countries
A	no
C	you don't know what it's like to do a masters or a PhD or
A	but I wouldn't say it to that degree I mean if you know people that have done it and you've spoken to people that have done it you do have some inclination and you do have some idea you know you've watched travel programmes you've spoken to people that have done these things I wouldn't turn around to say to someone you have no idea I would say your idea is your perception is skewed it's not and I'm sure people would say the same to me but I've not found people that have children to be like that
C	mm it's kind of like wait till you have your own then you'll understand
A	I found them to be fairly black and white like wait until you have your own children and then you'll know
C	mm
A	as if there's some magical boundary that you're gonna cross and then suddenly it all becomes clear when you have a child I find that quite patronising to tell
C	it would it would be quite interesting if you do to then have a conversation again just to see if you
A	and I'm sure I'd make all the same mistakes that everyone else does
C	no but just to see if you actually said you know what? I get it now kind of thing or
A	you think I would then by by that er question
C	no no not necessarily I just it would be interesting to see because of how you feel
A	mm
C	kind of thing or or not
A	well
C	it's selfish to have children sometimes
A	and I that's what I think
C	I've had
A	I've put in
C	I've had all three of you because I'm totally selfish
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about selfish person	Neutral
A	I just think that quite a few people that get into their thirties and don't have children have probably put a hell of a lot more thought into not having children
C	mm
A	than the people that had children
C	and a lot of
A	yeah there's definitely a lack of years isn't there? in life that's er
C	I think people are different I think I think couples or youngsters or older people that don't have children are different to the people that do
A	mm
C	in the way they see life and other people and expectations maybe
A	but I mean as a teacher I have the potential to impact a variety of children or a variety of people
C	mm
A	not just my one child
C	but you can go home at the end of the night
A	I mean I'd have to I work my job is working with people
C	mm
[ANNOTATION]	they are not sure about childbearing	Neutral
A	all the time you know what I mean?
C	mm
A	and I'm not talking just on the phone or something it's very very close contact with
C	mm
[ANNOTATION]	person A is not sure contact with them or not	Neutral
A	with people numerous people a lot of people all the time
C	I haven't put any pressure you on you to have children
A	I wouldn't say you put pressure on me but I know
C	all I've said to you is I just don't think you're in that right
A	I know deep down that you want me to have children
C	god and I'd love to have er
A	exactly
C	hold your son
A	exactly
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about a film	Contradiction
C	or daughter in my arms
A	that's pressure
C	of course I would
A	that's pressure you say that you don't but you've just said that you totally would want that to happen so that's pressure
C	but
A	I'm not saying that's a bad thing
C	yeah
A	but it's just something that
C	yeah
A	deciding not to have children
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about childbearing	Entailment
C	yeah
A	it's a very very big decision to make
C	yeah do you think the pressure is more on
A	and we have to live with it for a whole
C	that you should have a child
A	what than not having one?
C	when you're together as a couple?
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about party	Contradiction
A	oh massively so and especially now I've proposed to
C	yeah
A	is totally like when are you having children?
C	yeah yeah
A	when's this happening?
C	yeah yeah
A	when's that bit coming?
C	yeah
A	and it's like well you know what I mean? and living abroad it's even harder because that is a very strict system
C	mm
A	you know what I mean?
C	mm
A	in Korea you have a
C	mm
A	they can't understand why you don't have children
C	mm
A	so pretty much every single Korean you meet and get to know a little bit is gonna be asking you where are your children? and why haven't you had children yet?
C	you've just you've just gotta find a line haven't you? just
A	in Korea like it's expensive
C	yeah
A	we haven't saved up enough yet you make a joke out of it but
C	yeah or you just say time's not right
A	yeah but it's it's tough I don't
C	mm
A	I don't know if people that have children think enough about what
C	I would imagine it's tougher for
A	erm mm perhaps yeah I would probably say that she's a
C	I would imagine there's been a lot of her friends since she's come home saying oh when are you gonna have a baby then? now kind of thing
A	none of her friends have children though
C	oh really?
A	no no
C	oh maybe that takes the pressure off of her
A	erm the only people that have children now of either side of our friends quite interestingly strangely actually cos when I spoke about BAs and having a degree none of her school friends close friends have children none of my close school friends have children we both have mutual friends from university there are two that have had children
C	mm
C	yeah
C	mm
A	it's only our uni group
C	mm
A	and two of them have so I don't know if just if you're that type of person that you end up starting to side with people that don't want to have children and
C	mm
A	they they're the type of friends because let's face it it's gonna be tough to keep in contact with people that do want kids and have kids because
C	mm
A	our lives don't correspond so therefore
C	mm mm
A	you're not gonna have those people as friends really so
C	mm
A	it's erm
C	mm
A	it's a complicated situation
C	who knows?
A	and then you get poor well not poor people but you get people like
C	I know
A	and couldn't have them
C	I know
A	they're the real ones that people should be focussing on you know what I mean?
C	I know especially when you've had er a tough time as well
A	yeah
C	in life you just think
A	they're the ones that
C	why can't she have a family that she wants?
A	yeah
C	so desperately
A	they're the ones that should have children
C	yeah
A	it's sad
C	yeah it is
A	mm
C	and she's a lovely lady
A	as I said because we have this plan I can't where where do you fit children into that plan?
C	mm
A	and that plan is much more important to me than the other
C	mm
A	I could write come up with some revolutionary theory that has an impact on lots of people forever or
C	who's to say though
A	I could have one child and
C	that you and
A	we may do we may do
C	who's to say?
A	it might may happen that's one thing that so obviously a part of
C	mm
A	all we know is we definitely don't want them now
C	you're not ready at the moment yeah
A	we definitely don't want them now definitely not
C	well I would stop putting pressure on yourselves and
A	oh we don't put pressure on ourselves it's other people putting pressure on us
C	yeah but if you get asked
A	so
C	the question just say oh not for quite a few years yet
A	oh I know I know how to deal with it it's not a problem I don't care what other people think
C	yeah
A	I don't give a shit so just laugh it off it's just tiring if people keep asking I can pretty much guarantee
C	yeah
A	what somebody'll say
C	it's the
A	then you have kids
C	have you got a house? what you doing?
A	er but it's just
C	it's just human nature
A	as if there's one path
C	yeah
A	there's one way of living so
C	I know
A	I feel so privileged to live in a time where I can do the things that I'm doing that even fifty years prior you couldn't do
C	yeah
A	fifty years ago not many people went to university not many people er could travel the world or did travel the world
C	I know it's amazing
A	couldn't do those things I feel a fool to turn down those things that are the dawning of this age that
C	yeah
A	I really I really really struggle to connect with people that don't see why we travel I really
C	mm
A	struggle with that
C	mm mm
A	because I'm so fascinated by experience and life
C	mm
A	that why wouldn't you wanna see the world?
C	exactly
A	why wouldn't you wanna see every corner of this planet?
C	mm mm
A	I'm actually wish I was born in an area era where we could travel space and I could go to different planets
C	mm
A	and this kind of stuff that's why I
C	mm
A	I want more than this but it doesn't exist
C	it's lovely though
A	it is it's difficult though
C	it's lovely that you've got that hunger for it all
A	mm
C	yeah
A	to not feel much of a connection with a lot of people because they don't think like you do you wanna find the people that think like you do
C	but do you need to find any more people?
A	you wanna feel community
C	you know you
A	oh you need community everyone needs community
C	but you've got that already in your group of friends that you've already got won't there come a time when you don't
A	yeah but they're disparate they live in different parts of the world
C	yeah
A	I don't spend you know
C	yeah
A	a lot of time with them one of the hardest things I come to grips with is
C	mm
A	cos ninety-five to a hundred percent of people
C	mm
A	are like that but I look back and think of all the people I've met in the last ten years
C	mm
A	and I mean I've just met a whole bunch of new people just starting this masters course
C	mm mm
A	I
C	mm
A	and I just look at other people that are just
C	they go to work come home they see their friends
A	I feel bad cos I feel like I'm I'm trying to tag you in but that's not what I'm saying but I mean you look at most adults that have children
C	mm
A	and you and you get older and you're like where are my friends gone? where did this happen where all these people?
C	mm mm
A	because you don't have time you don't have time to meet people
C	mm mm mm
A	I'm not blaming people for that but that's just the way it is
C	mm mm
[ANNOTATION]	none of speaker a's friends have had children	Contradiction
A	and I just really struggle with that cos I meet some really great people
C	mm
A	and really inspiring people and just think
C	how lucky are you
A	keep meeting people
C	mm
A	that's why I've struggled with being in a monogamous relationship because again it's learning
[ANNOTATION]	both speakers just met	Neutral
C	mm
A	I think how much I learn from being with this person well surely
C	mm
A	if I was with somebody else I'd learn a hell of a lot more again
C	mm mm
A	that's had to be a sacrifice er for me
C	mm
A	I've had to say okay well I'm I
C	mm mm
A	it's not gonna happen so yeah a part of me and I struggled and I fought with that for a while saying well I could be with someone else and I could learn a hell of a lot more with them
C	mm
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a thinks being in a relationship teaches you new things	Entailment
A	personally I think that
C	mm
A	and have an amazing time with that person
C	mm
A	for ten years and then move on and have an amazing time with another person for ten years
C	mm
A	if only life was structured more like that where ending the last relationship isn't the be-all and end-all
C	mm
A	if only we could move on
C	mm
A	and still be close with the other person
C	mm mm
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a wants to be with the same partner for life	Contradiction
A	but that doesn't happen
C	no no
A	so I've had to make that that's a sacrifice that
C	mm
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a got married twice	Neutral
A	I've done that but
C	mm
A	definitely a part of my way of thinking is saying you know and I've fought with that for a while is no you you know somebody else will teach you a hell of a lot more and open up a whole world of experiences to you so
C	mm mm
A	I struggle and that's why I don't disagree with divorce and all this kind of things I totally understand it and I haven't and I like no no
C	mm
A	misconception it's just having children massively complicates the situation so
C	mm mm than the actual marriage bit
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a is adventurous	Neutral
A	yeah but I mean
C	mm
A	if you remove the children divorce it doesn't really mean anything does it?
C	no no hence my first it was nothing and it was
A	yeah it only hurts you and the other person
C	mm
A	that's it
C	mm
A	maybe your parents are like well I really liked that
C	so it's
A	that guy or that girl
C	mm
A	it's er kind of a shame that fell through but it's quite a loose relationship really
C	mm it is the children
A	once you put children in there
C	yeah
A	it's a completely different scenario
C	yeah
A	completely different
C	yeah totally
A	because of the construct that we live in that
C	mm
A	it does affect them negatively when you move
C	mm
A	between partners
C	mm
A	that I struggle with
C	because if they're happy with their lives and what they're doing
A	that's fine
C	then that's what they want
A	yeah that's fine
C	yeah
A	no people can be happy for different reasons
C	it's the people that aren't happy but do nothing about it
A	yeah yeah they're they're the ones that get to me the people that are like
C	mm
A	oh I'd love to do what you're doing
C	mm
A	and don't
C	see I was a bit like with you know
A	no no he's
C	he likes his own space
A	he's a different person
C	he likes his own his own company to a certain extent and I think he'd be quite happy with a small group of friends
A	mm
C	not
A	I mean as am I I'm not
C	mm
A	er although yeah I'm saying I know a lot of people
C	mm
A	I only really need three to five close friends at any one time
C	mm mm
A	and then another ten good acquaintances or good most
C	mm
A	he's completely different but
C	mm
A	and each to their own
C	but I'm glad
A	each to their own right
C	yeah but I am so glad that he's you know gone and done what he's done and you've helped him do that and then coming out to Korea as well you've encouraged him to do that with
A	can you imagine though can you imagine if that first husband who you got with
C	erm
A	whatever it was imagine that that's what you're
C	I was working in the children's home
A	okay
C	yeah
A	imagine that now as old as you are you're still with that guy
C	oh
A	and you're still doing that job
C	god no
A	that that amount of time has parted
C	well it makes me freak
A	I personally think people should change jobs every five to ten years regardless
C	mm
A	just because you meet a whole bunch of people you learn a lot of things about yourself you learn more skills in the job
C	totally yeah
A	I have complete respect for the different jobs that you've gone through and the different kind of things and I completely understood when you got your job in the
C	mm
A	you hadn't worked in that kind of environment before
C	mm
A	I respect that with people it's the people that get married very young get the same job and that's it for the rest of their life
C	mm mm
A	it's a waste I just think it's a big waste of life
C	but they're happy
A	and it's like are they? I mean and if they are okay
C	yeah
A	but I mean
C	no I know yeah
A	I mean that's fine if that's what you are but
C	but is it that or is just that they know no different?
A	I'm never gonna
C	and if they actually opened their eyes
A	it may just be
C	had a different adventure
A	happiness through security and comfort
C	or yeah
A	and not putting themselves in in dangerous
C	yeah
A	you shouldn't
C	and different people do show you different things
A	shouldn't
C	and different sides of yourselves and different
A	shouldn't yeah
C	adventures and stuff like that
A	you shouldn't be happy your whole life this idea if you live in ignorant bliss your whole life something's kind of wrong
C	mm
A	just as much as happiness is experience sadness is an experience
C	mm
A	I wouldn't get rid of any of the negative things that I've had in my life they've shaped me
C	mm mm
A	they've it's an experience it's part of living like emotions are important and these kind of things
C	mm
A	you don't in fact it takes to be sad to realise how happy you are when you're happy so I just
C	mm
A	it's just me I just that's why I'm saying why I find it difficult to connect with people like that cos I just think we are very very different
C	mm
A	and I just I beyond pleasantries I don't have much to say to you I can't really talk to you so
C	mm
A	they're the people I struggle with and
C	well that's understandable isn't it?
A	there are quite a few of them around
C	mm
A	so
C	there sure are
A	but that's I think it's fine you can do what you want it just seems such a shame when there's I mean it's the old
C	and there's so many countries and places
A	it's the old analogy it's like
C	mm
A	somebody tells you this is a really good book so you buy it and then you read the the front or you open you read the first page and you're like oh this is such a good book I love this book
C	mm mm
A	and I just spend the whole rest of my life reading that same page over and over and over because I love that page
C	mm
A	but I don't actually know what's on the
C	mm
A	this page is really good too
C	mm
A	and then about halfway through the book
C	it is I think a lot of it is security with people
A	oh yeah definitely
C	and and like
A	fear
C	yeah
A	it's fear
C	yeah
A	but that's the way society is shaped we're shaped to be if we
C	and to take yourself out of that comfort zone takes something to happen I think sometimes with people
A	mm I mean I could say all this and I could end up on my own very sad in the future I have no idea I have no idea what the future holds
C	mm
A	to connect with a hell of a lot of people which is why I said I'm looking always on the lookout for a community of people that are like-minded because everyone needs
C	yeah
A	a community of people that are like them and I I
C	mm
A	quite live quite far away from where I am now if I never have children I can always visit them if I have kids they're not gonna be a part of my child's life really
C	mm
A	I mean they might see them every so often but that community that I'm building is not a very good community for having a child in
C	mm
A	if they're the people that I want my child to be around how am I gonna get them all together to do that? they're gonna be surrounded I'm gonna go to school with those people and be looking at all the rest of the parents and thinking I don't like you
C	mm
A	I don't get on with you so do you know what I mean?
C	yeah
A	that's what I worry about where am I gonna find this amazing school that's gonna be full of parents that are these kind of people? cos you have to spend time with these parents you have to deal with these people
C	mm you don't really
A	I mean you must chat to them briefly when you stand outside school and wait for your thing
C	I don't though do I? I don't I don't
A	I mean you should do you should do
C	I don't see them at the school
A	they're the parents of the children that are er you know
C	yeah the only time
A	you should have community with these people
C	the only time I do is when I'm waiting to pick him up for sports clubs and things
A	mm
C	and I had more time with parents before when I had you and
A	yeah I mean of course you're so busy I don't and again I have a lot of respect for that
C	yeah well it's not the right way is it? to kind of like
A	there's no right way
C	no
A	there's no right way
C	just not ideal to work full-time and have a child but
A	no but that's what everyone does you can't
C	mm
A	can't not
C	well I certainly
A	no
C	not now not after finding a life outside of home if you know what I mean
A	but imagine that system that I proposed where you look after a child for a few years
C	mm
A	what if
C	mm
A	relationship with
C	mm
A	let's talk about somebody else you look after a child from the age of zero to five and during that time you get massively subsidised for work you don't have to work many hours you could do your work at home
C	but that's like er like fostering isn't it?
A	yeah so you have that child for a few years and then you go back into full-time work and you still have access to that child
C	mm
A	you can still go and visit them you can still spend time with them at the weekends and in the evenings if you want to but now somebody else is completely off work looking after that child also
C	mm mm
A	and they have and they end up growing up and actually having access to numerous families that they can live with
C	mm mm
A	and numerous
C	mm mm
A	and you can go and live cos it's fair you know we do have family but you can't just go up and go and live with uncle
C	mm
A	you can't do that
C	mm mm
A	they don't have room in their life for you so
C	mm
A	it's a it's a very cursory you know
C	mm
A	a partial relationship that you have with them really
C	mm
A	the closest you can get is grandparents because they don't have to work so
C	mm
A	you can kind of have your grandparents around quite a bit so
C	mm
A	it's the whole system's just not conducive to having a healthy lifestyle for children I don't think which is why I just
C	mm
A	I'm not the right person to have a child
A	I think about it too much
C	are you hungry?
A	I'll have some yoghurt probably
C	I'm feeling a little bit hungry
A	oh is your stomach back?
C	it's okay again now at the moment
A	yeah
C	yeah probably till I eat something and then it'll all start I don't think I can drink any more wine now
A	do you just think I'm weird the stuff I talk about?
C	no why would I think?
A	I often think that dad thinks I'm strange
C	what just because you have different views and opinions?
A	mm
C	really? does he say to you you're weird then?
A	no I think in some areas he respects and thinks you know I obviously know what I'm talking about here and then in other areas I just think he thinks I just I don't know what I'm talking about I just
C	mm
A	what am I talking about? I'm clearly wrong on this you know what I mean?
C	yeah but your
A	mm
C	that's probably where he would kind of like stand up and whereas I think I'm more kind of open to just listening and hearing what you're saying and understanding you're coming from a different perspective
