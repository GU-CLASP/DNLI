A	I think kind of like since yeah since we kind of got back from Paris and had like a chat
B	mm
A	she just kind of
B	yeah
A	erm
B	mm
A	since Paris once or twice erm and then today like normally we have breakfast Friday and then last week I didn't do cos we were going out for dinner in the evening and I I just can't eat that much
B	mm
A	like a
B	mm
A	and I was like okay I wonder where she's going got breakfast on her own and then someone said oh didn't you go with
B	okay
A	and I was like I didn't do it one day
B	very peculiar
A	you alright? what did you do?
B	just lifted that juice up and flicked it out
A	oh
B	just got water down my top
A	nice
B	that's quite a
B	good shot though water well done
A	yeah she's just
B	being weird
A	being
B	it was actually quite
A	yeah yeah
B	like to be fair that's what my jobs gonna be
A	really?
B	get used to it I suppose
A	how many days are you gonna be working from home?
B	dunno
A	oh okay
B	we have got a base but
A	rent
A	building yeah
B	so there's gonna be like a team of sixty with space for twenty so there's not gonna be any room for anyone so we'll be working remotely quite a lot
A	I guess as long as you do the job it doesn't matter where you work though does it? like
B	it just makes it a lot
A	mm
B	people that perhaps I don't know think that they can do it on their own and that that's where it could get a bit dangerous really
A	I think monitoring people is gonna be dangerous
B	mm
A	it's gonna be hard because at work yeah I do fuck about sometimes and do like online shopping or check the Daily Mail and stuff
B	mm
A	but I still do my work
B	yeah
A	if I was at home I would think I could be so easily be like oh it's lunch break let's watch an episode on Netflix
B	mm
A	oh let's have another episode on Netflix
A	yeah you have to be really
B	mm I suppose the difference is is that if I don't get something done then someone
A	yeah
B	as a result
A	yeah
B	I mean I probably wouldn't work
A	yeah
B	because oh the fucking table's
A	oh god
B	so wobbly
A	I know god
B	erm
A	mm
B	I'd imagine it would be so you'd probably fit all your
A	yeah
B	in the days after probably
A	yeah
B	at home
A	how much are you gonna be
B	don't know
A	or
B	how it'll work
A	mm
B	we'll see
A	I'd love to work from home a few days but
B	quite enjoyed it I mean I can I I I could work from home as
A	no and also going to work you get the social side of it as well like
B	yeah exactly
A	I like the people I work with
B	mm
A	it's a really nice team I like going in and seeing them and
B	yeah
A	building that relationship with people like and then I'm more likely to get something people are more likely to do something for you or you're more likely to do something for somebody else if you're there on the spot they come up to your desk they tell you to do it
B	or they know you already
A	or they know you and they're like
B	mm
A	yeah okay and you build that relationship with people like I if I'm like if you have a like solely email relationships with people it's quite difficult
B	people don't really have that bond do they?
A	no and like well even even if you just speak to someone on the phone you get across a bit of your personality and
B	mm
A	you know what type like if you're a bit chirpy or how you say things so
B	yeah
A	I think it's really important to meet people face to face
B	defo
A	do you know when you're gonna have to start doing it more often or is it now? basically
B	erm
A	mm
B	from the first so
A	yeah
B	just when Christmas starts
B	that's sixty
A	oh so yeah maybe it is
B	yeah
A	yeah sixty-eight yeah
B	yeah
A	it'll be
B	I thought you said eighty-six
A	it is eighty-six
B	oh yeah sixty
B	mm
A	and that was eighty-five wasn't it?
B	I was being really stupid then
A	I dunno it's around yeah okay fair enough it is around the eighty I take it back whoever wrote that on Facebook
B	you're right
A	me judging you
B	I am
A	oh okay
B	it's just hard to eat cos it's hot
A	yeah
B	mm and I'm cooling it
A	the moment people start being like what are you gonna get that person for Christmas? I'm like oh fuck
B	dunno
A	I have no idea
B	pass
A	I don't start Christmas shopping until like the week before Christmas
B	yeah
A	yeah you said I think that's gonna be so cool that's gonna be so cute
B	well I'll try
A	like I
B	yeah
A	it's so stupid
A	good at the same time
B	you hope someone would would definitely make the cake but they probably won't
A	yeah
A	yeah you would hope
B	mm
A	although knowing me I would be
B	that would be the thing wouldn't it? you'd have to trust them that they put it in right
A	yeah
B	just dump it all in the bowl and put it in
B	mm
A	whisk it and it's done
B	mm fingers crossed it comes out
A	comes out and gives everybody food poisoning wahoo er but you can't really give people food poisoning with a cake can you? unless the egg's gone off
B	unless the egg yeah unless the egg's dodgy but no
A	death by cake
B	if they got food poisoning by the cake it wouldn't be your fault it'd be the egg fault
A	that's true
B	mm I've heard that before
A	like what the fuck?
B	more than a shark attack
A	yeah well who who who dies from a vending machine? like
B	some idiot that shakes it
A	well
B	it is really stupid
A	people die in the most stupid way sometimes
B	there's a lot of selfie deaths now as well apparently
A	oh I did see that death by selfie stick was it?
B	mm
A	what is it? because you're
A	or?
B	some of them
A	I dunno
B	were like that cos you're paying so much to the selfie you don't look where you're going
A	mm
B	who is that?
A	who is it?
B	an 0 two 0 number
A	an 0 two 0 number?
B	they hung up
A	what twats
B	probably one of those cold calls sometimes they see I pick up they ring me back again
A	I got an 0 two 0 number today call me and I just didn't I just ignored it I always ignore them because I hate them so much and
B	they're so annoying
A	you're gonna talk to me about some shit that I don't want
B	leave me alone
A	yeah it's like if I want to if I want to talk to you I'll call you
B	they ring you
A	mm
A	I've never thought about PPI claims before it's like
A	for fuck
A	yeah
B	I love garlic bread
A	it is a good shout whoever invented it just
B	mm
A	really really wanted something crunchy and garlicky
B	they knew
A	they knew
B	oops
A	you alright? you start throwing it everywhere
B	just flicking myself with garlic
A	to be fair there are worse things to be flicked by
B	octopus actually I I tried octopus it's not actually that bad
A	I tried as well it was actually okay
B	mm
A	did you know when an octopus gets stressed it eats its own leg?
B	yes
A	oh okay
B	ruined
A	ruined
B	yeah I've heard that before
B	yeah
A	or something like that
B	now that's dramatic
A	yeah now that is dramatic
A	too far
B	I mean can you imagine if that's what we did when we were stressed?
B	to be fair we'd be limbless wouldn't we really?
A	we
B	maybe yeah yeah yeah you'd do that first
A	so that'd mean you'd only be able to get stressed ten
B	fourteen
A	twenty
B	oh no twenty-four times
A	twenty-four times that is that is not good
B	we'd probably be dead by now
A	yeah we would
B	twenty er you'd average it out once a year maybe
A	do octopuses' legs grow back?
B	dunno
A	oh cos that just seems like a really poor
A	evolutionary
B	I was gonna say evaluation then evolutionary thing yeah
A	yeah that seems really stupid
B	what does that benefit them?
A	yeah
B	they don't have nerves in their legs I don't know
A	I mean they must
A	they must no they must move them so they must have nerves
B	mm true
A	so what did you two do on a Friday night? well we pondered the lives of
A	octopus is it octopi? octopi octopuses octopi fuck it octopi
A	oh
B	octopi
A	I don't think it is octopi is it? octopuses? octopus google it
B	I think it's just octopus
A	octopuses what? so
B	it's an octopus
A	a group of octopus
B	yeah
A	like sheep?
B	yeah
A	okay
B	plural of
B	oh it's the first thing that comes up
A	oh really?
B	it's Latin
A	Latin? Latin version oh Latin
B	octopuses
A	octopuses
B	yeah
A	that sounds really wrong
B	hang on hang on
A	hang on is that some stupid person like saying this octopuses?
B	it is often supposed that octopi is the correct plural of octopus and it has
A	oktopous?
B	and its correct plural logically would be octopodes
A	octopodes oh
B	other words ending in us show a very varied pattern like octopi the plural hippopotami is general generally taken to be either funny or absurdly pedantic and the er but the usual plural is hippopotamuses
A	hippopotamuses could it is er it is hippopotami isn't it?
B	no
A	oh hippopotamus er oh good god okay
B	common usage appears to indicate the slight preference for termini rather than terminuses but syllabuses rather than syllabi
A	well yeah we say syllabuses
B	mm
A	mm
B	gladioli
A	fungi
B	so it's nuclei
A	and nuclei
B	and fungi
A	yeah cos omnibi sucubi incubi they're all like horror creatures aren't they?
B	are they?
A	yeah cos in that I think you know Buffy the Vampire Slayer when she meets Giles and he gets out the books and he was like incubi sucubi?
A	no? just clearly
A	I remember that episode
B	among words ending in um it seems worth drawing attention this is really interesting
A	yeah
B	worth drawing attention to the word curricula the plural of curriculum a warning against confusion with the adjective curricular as in extra curricular
A	oh okay
B	so curricula
A	cos er cos people say curriculums don't they? you
B	it's curricula
A	curricula
A	so people wouldn't
B	mm
A	the English language is so peculiar
B	it's so hard
A	I know seriously
B	I think I've seen it before
A	yeah and it's like all
B	really difficult things about the language
B	yeah
A	that you're trying to work out how to say them and just how they look the same but they sound different and
B	mm
A	god even like we did it in the office and even people in the office were like I've got no idea what some of these words mean or how to even pronounce them they were really simple
B	they're just so hard
A	like is it this? is it that? I don't know
B	want to know what the plural of moose is?
A	moosi? mooses
B	it's moose
B	well I suppose geese
A	yeah no it just makes sense though isn't it like geese
B	meese
A	uhu
B	why is the plural of moose not meese?
A	yeah please do I want to know why the plural of moose is not meese
B	I think it's the same thing as the octopuses which is good but very
A	that it originated from a different place?
B	no I mean the same site
A	oh I see yeah
B	as the
A	uhu
A	why don't we? do tell
B	simple the simple reason is that it's a loanword all nouns that are borrowed into the English language from their plural with this with the standard plural ending S retain the plural ending of the donor
A	okay
B	all remained unchanged in the plural it is also quite possible for the same noun to employ more than one of the above types of plural
A	oh god
A	so basically it all depends on where the word originally was stolen from
B	you if if it's from another language you can't change the plural
A	mm okay
B	but why then do we say geese instead of goose?
[ANNOTATION]	Moose is a loan word.	Neutral
A	oh good god why do we?
B	after all geese is an obvious exception to the standard plural in English the reason goes back a millennium
A	oh good god
B	and a half
A	there were geese in like a millennium and half ago?
[ANNOTATION]	A millennium is a long time.	Neutral
B	in the beginnings of old English and to a sound change known as mutation
A	that went straight over over my head what does that mean?
B	all that linguistics background might sound pretty complicated
B	but it is just answering all your questions
A	it is this is just like knows what I'm gonna
A	oh
B	the number of such nouns was never large and it has grown smaller over the centuries because the tendency has been for these nouns to take on more common plural endings
A	like S
B	however beside goose there are still a few of these nouns left in English today which became the mutation plurals can you guess me any?
A	oh crap okay
B	tooth
A	teeth
B	teeth
A	yeah that's true
[ANNOTATION]	Linguistics is interesting	Neutral
B	and foot
A	feet
B	feet
A	that's true
[ANNOTATION]	Feet is a fun plural.	Neutral
B	the curiosity of moose and meese is just one of the several strange plurals dating from old English
A	and children what about
B	true
A	they're completely different
B	that didn't come next
A	oh okay
[ANNOTATION]	Children is a plural form.	Entailment
B	shall we google that though?
A	yeah
B	what else is there? house is hice
A	but then die is dice
B	isn't that a? yes hang on
A	not douse a douse doesn't become a dice it's a die becomes a dice or is it a dice become a die? no there's one die and then multiple dice
B	for more difficult plurals check out this place
B	bacterias bacteriae bacteriums sorting out the
A	whoever knows this must be off their head
A	it's just ridiculous
B	it's in Oxford dictionary though
A	oh fair enough fucking Oxford dictionary
B	okay
A	okay
B	in most cases all you need to do is tack an S onto the end of the singular so shop becomes shops donkey because donkeys I'm not gonna go all the way down this pizza becomes pizzas but then that that surely would be because it was an inherited word
A	yeah it should be an
B	yeah
A	then adopts the
B	just the S
A	yeah the S
B	or stays as it's
A	as it is yeah
B	as it is
A	doesn't become pizzai
B	pizzai
A	or pizzium
B	but then that means you could surely say
A	have a piece of
B	lots of pizza you would say that wouldn't you?
A	you would yeah yeah I've just bought lots of pizza
B	mm
A	er well you wouldn't well you would say I I've bought I but you say I bought some pizzas
B	mm
A	you would say I
B	no I would say I've bought some pizza
A	I would only say I bought some pizza if I'd bought one pizza
B	mm
A	if I'd bought like three I'd be like I've bought some pizzas
B	mm
A	but then I would say have some pizza implying have multiple slices
B	mm
A	have some pizzas
A	I think it's because it when you use the word pizza the
B	mm
A	it doesn't prefer to it refer to it when it's been separated or cut into slices cos they become slices of pizza don't they?
B	mm
A	you refer to it as a whole
B	mm true
A	or I've bought lots of cakes
B	mm anyway
A	mm weird
A	this sucks well not sucks but this is like the most ridiculous thing for twenty-four year olds to do
B	it's like I'm nearly twenty-five that's my excuse
A	you are nearly twenty
A	what?
B	no oh this mistake crops up in all types of writing I've
A	I've never done that I'd never be like oh that the that women
B	this is this is what this says Eileen was a lovely women
A	no one says that
A	a single women can have a child now
A	you say single women can have children now but you wouldn't say a you wouldn't say a single women can have a child now it's stupid
B	old Norse eggs and Italian pianos that's the next title
A	yeah
B	erm
A	oh okay
B	hazard and alcohol are Arabic
A	erm the irony being that they don't drink much alcohol
B	yeah
A	mm
B	so formed according to English rules piano
B	in effect there are no hard and fast rules as to whether as to whether the plural of such words are formed according to English rules so you've got piano pianos virus and viruses formed according to the rules of the parent language criterion becomes criteria bacterium becomes bacteria paparazzo becomes paparazzi
A	paparazzo?
B	that's the singular I would imagine of a paparazzi
A	I think people use the word paparazzi now to mean the singular
B	yeah
A	I
B	if there's a paparazzi yeah formed according to either English rules or those original language cactus cacti or cactuses virtuoso virtuosos of virtuosi
A	what's a virtuoso?
B	dunno
A	okay
A	sounds like something from Harry Potter
B	chateau becomes chateaux as in a French spelling or chateaus with an S on the end
A	no that looks ridiculous
B	it does
A	like the Oxford dictionary not that we're selling ourselves by the way guys
B	no
A	you don't have to buy us but we really think you should uhu uhu
B	but this is all going on about octopus again now hang on
A	we already know about octopus okay?
B	we've learnt about
B	does it say about mice I'm gonna I'm gonna google it right now why is the plural
A	and even just like
B	mm
A	so there's one plural one singular but then you have with sweeteners
B	mm
A	so there's like so sugar in that sense is a singular but then sweeteners is a plural implying a
B	you do say sugars don't you?
A	yeah sugars yeah
B	mm
A	mm
B	well it's not gonna say
A	no no it says here it says aspartame and
B	no I mean
A	no it says with sweeteners
B	so that wouldn't say with two sweeteners
A	no no but
A	well yeah just with the
B	mm
A	to replace one sugar
B	mm
A	and I think in one country I was reading in England there was like ten teaspoons of sugar in
B	mm
A	in one can of something you're just like
B	crazy
A	ten teaspoons of sugar in one three hundred and thirty mil can of something is
A	you can understand why like in America they have such a problem
B	uhu
A	but apparently the Japanese have some of the sweetest drinks but they're like tiny
B	what did
A	mm
B	for breakfast and for dinner eat a lot of like rice and
A	yeah
B	something else
A	yeah I can imagine yeah
B	I watched a documentary about India as well where the middle class they can they're the only ones that can
A	yeah
B	middle class especially
A	yeah yeah
B	really big obesity problem in children
A	in China as well same problem
B	yeah really really bad
A	yeah yeah it must be so different for them like us going to China and stuff it or like going abroad it even just going abroad to like I'd never went to Barcelona and stuff it still like it still makes your tummy go a bit weird
B	mm
A	because like I Barcelona we ate so much carbs like
B	yeah
A	or a different form of carbohydrate to what we're used to here
B	mm
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	like I always find when you go on holiday you never eat as many vegetables and stuff as you should do
B	no
A	but then in Turkey like I didn't have too much problems but erm
B	mm
A	like a shitload of oil
B	yeah
A	but
B	weird isn't it?
A	mm
B	mm maybe
A	anyway
B	who knows?
A	well
B	oh yeah
A	like there are some days obviously where I eat cake and shit like that but
B	mm
A	so it's like yeah it's like when like with the whole breakfast thing with
B	mm
A	if I eat anything it's like just goes to my butt and my legs
B	she might have a lot of visceral fat though
A	true I just think er she also must have a very good metabolism
B	yeah
A	mine's just shit my metabolism it's so like slow
B	so is mine
A	not that I'm blaming that why I'm a little bit tubby but you know what I mean
B	life's too short for that
A	mm
A	I know I was thinking that as well I was like for fuck's sake
B	well I'll start in here doe
A	I've gotta do my ironing
B	the living is actually fine isn't it really?
A	mm
B	all things considered
A	just got to sweep it I guess don't we?
B	dust it I suppose
A	bit of dusting
A	it's just this room it just looks messy but it's just because it's just such a dreary colour like the white is like this dodgy off white the floor genuinely looks
B	filthy
A	filthy
B	to be fair though it must have been like this when we looked at it and I don't remember thinking god this kitchen's filthy
A	that's true
B	so I think it would be as I said people have like rose tinted glasses on don't they when they look round houses?
A	mainly cos most people just wanna get in don't they?
B	yeah
A	yeah we did that's true we just couldn't be arsed to look round any more
A	house hunting is so
B	so boring
A	painful I remember didn't we only look round two or three? did we look at?
B	I
A	when
B	that was it
A	yeah and
B	oh no we looked round did you look round on your own?
A	oh yeah I did yeah
A	and it was really small
B	yeah
A	it was really small
B	those three that I forgot about the
B	to be fair this was absolutely fine when we found it
A	oh yeah
B	so what's the point of looking at any more? I can't
A	exactly
B	be bothered
A	exactly
A	even just thinking about it makes me wanna cry
B	it's oh
A	like
B	god
A	we did not to do any more no more house hunting well until like in a few months
B	yeah
A	I need to go and look for like a cheap room somewhere
B	that should be easy though surely for you because
A	yeah it's just a spare I'm just gonna er have a look on Spareroom I don't need a house do I? I just need a room oh well I'm looking for maybe about four hundred pounds a month something like that?
B	yeah
A	mm yeah
B	it's quite a good one
A	I just wanna rent a room hopefully just maybe still in
B	nice
A	bit more convenient
A	no I'll just have a look and find somewhere nice then it'll be fine
B	surely there'll be people in
A	exactly yeah exactly
B	mm
A	so and it's only gonna be for like January to June or something January
B	mm
A	to May so
A	yeah
B	I know I I'm already thinking about the next payday
A	so am I
A	I mean I've got two weeks to go and I've something pathetic like a hundred quid to last me
A	just I know exactly where my money goes
B	I say that
A	I know
A	I only just bought a jacket today
A	I know and it's like not gonna be spend any more money oh this jacket's really nice
A	dunno why dunno why I do this to myself but no to be fair genuinely everything I'm doing in October has already been paid for
B	yeah
A	both my holidays in November have already been paid for and I'm
B	no
A	all I've got to do is go to like maybe
B	yeah same
B	hot chocolate and mulled wine
A	so hopefully December and especially if we don't have to pay rent here
B	mm
A	hopefully December I should be able to save like a good five hundred six hundred pounds maybe
B	uhu
A	so that would be good
B	hopefully you'll be able to maybe ring up the electric people on if
A	well that was what I'm thinking if when the moment we find out I will ring the electrics erm I will ring the water
B	yeah
B	I'm gonna as well because they they literally just disconnect you on like the day that you ring up so I'm just gonna I'll ring when on the day we move out
A	what for the internet?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	I was thinking as well it'll actually be less than two hundred pounds when we get there
A	by the time we go yeah I guess yeah
B	cos he was he was calculating it from yesterday so
B	yeah I thought that as well yeah
A	that would be two months less so I don't know I'll be like a hundred and fifty or something
A	mm
B	er less than that cos it's sixty
A	it won't be the end of the world
B	no
A	but yeah but if we get to if we moved down in December that'll be two months' rent technically saved
B	yeah which is good
A	which will be really good
B	really handy
A	that's like eight hundred quid saved seven hundred and fifty quid which obviously I have to spend like on petrol driving
B	yeah but it was it wouldn't be like you were then missing it from the other money though
A	no exactly yeah
B	yeah fine yay
A	yay
A	probably just yeah just er moving out in December just means we wouldn't have to pay over Christmas when neither of us are here
B	yeah a waste of time
A	exactly a waste of time waste of money waste of everything really
A	well just
B	helpful
A	just a nerd
B	what did you keep on there?
A	erm so what I have I have move out day first or second week in December we are flexible and happy to move out early December erm kitchen including dishwasher washing machine table chairs cooker fridge obviously but erm living room drawers shelf bookcase TV stand cos we wanting them to know that they're gonna have to buy a sofa and a TV and
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	stuff like that erm bedrooms drawers built in wardrobe and then I wrote single bed currently in neighbour's garage but as we bought our own two double beds bills outline how much we pay each month
A	that's all they need to know and then like at the bottom I think I just said like it comes to something like five hundred quid a month
B	mm
A	which is like which isn't bad
A	no they won't they will get in the car and like they're fucking weirdos
B	shall we hand them out at the door when they leave?
A	well you know I would like to know how much I would be paying in bills
B	yeah
A	if I moved into a place
B	well we were pretty
A	yeah
B	I mean it was a nice surprise but it could have been a horrible surprise
A	mm
B	what was she paying again?
A	like two hundred pounds a month or something
A	it's like
B	they really did her over
A	yeah like what the hell are you
A	and there are two of us like
A	about love?
B	she was weird
A	she was bless her heart wasn't she?
B	my bed? I'll keep it
A	mm
A	oh I see so is your mum gonna get rid of that one does she think?
B	she's gonna put it indoors somewhere
A	I'm gonna talk to my parents a be like can I move cos the thing is
B	good idea
A	when I go back
B	she is?
A	yeah shit
B	right
A	so they're offering her I think it's like a lump sum of thirteen or fifteen thousand pounds
B	oh great
A	erm a pension because she might want to retire at fifty-eight years old cos
B	thanks guys
A	yeah
B	thanks for all that support
A	yeah
B	that I've given you yeah
A	yeah so that's that's like just over a thousand pounds a year redundancy package they've given her and she's been there for like ten years so yeah it's a pathetic amount and she's not
B	why?
A	start another job within three months of your redundancy package if not it's forfeited and you don't get the money so she's got to be out of work from December through till March I think
B	she's gonna be a real pleasure to work with in that time
A	oh
A	I'm not entirely sure what she's gonna do but she's got to do something
B	have they kept on thingy
A	I don't know I don't think they've kept on anybody
B	that's what she knows?

B	what morons
A	mm
B	well good luck to them
A	yeah
B	yes
A	dunno who's gonna be organising the exams now
B	exactly who's gonna be doing that? shit
A	but yeah so
B	are they they I think that they can just get someone else then I guess to do it
A	yeah someone else in cheaper
B	that's quite a lot of money
A	quite a
B	why couldn't they just have reduced her pay?
A	dunno I just don't know but either way she's gonna be made redundant I think and they're just gonna mum and dad are just gonna have to work it out
B	does she not want to get another job then?
A	I don't know I don't know what she's
B	as you've discussed no she cannot
A	like well maybe not forty years
B	she'll waste her years away
A	yeah
B	on Candy Crush
A	yeah thirty years left she can't sit at home and
B	this could break them
A	this could break them so
B	why doesn't she become a freelance cake maker?
A	not good enough at cakes
B	no?
A	she's more like a cooker than a baker I think she should just get like a
B	mm
A	I I was like well you could move to Cambridge mum you've always wanted to move to
A	why not? mm
B	I love her little ideas that she
A	I know
B	we're off
A	we're off what's happening?
A	no
B	oh that's really really bad
A	it is bad er luckily dad I think dad's dad earns enough to support them both at the moment
B	yeah
A	and obviously because they don't have a mortgage or anything they have
B	yeah that that helps
A	it's like his whole salary it's not like it's his it's not like a salary that loads of bills have to come out of
B	is the house finished yet?
A	no
B	not so bad yeah could be worse
A	they got curtains up
B	good

A	I haven't been since we've been here
B	oh no
A	no
B	I haven't been to yours since we've been here
A	no
B	not really
B	pretty weird
A	let's just go to your house for the day
A	yeah no so I think she's gonna be jobless
B	oh
A	oh well she'll find something else it's just you need the looking for another job is effort and she needs the motivation and the kick up the arse to do it
B	Candy Crush or looking at jobs
A	exactly
B	many box sets of many different series or looking for jobs
A	jobs
A	exactly well hopefully she's got three months to get that out of her system and then she'll be back on the job job market
A	hopefully
B	so is she stop stopping work now?
A	no thirtieth of December I think
B	that's even
A	yeah
B	worse that's like a kick in the pants
A	yeah it's Christmas and now you're jobless woohoo
B	yeah see you
A	fuck you schools
B	we'll see you
A	and also
B	over Christmas but after that you're out
A	but it's a really bad time I think but also I feel so really sorry for
B	oh shit
A	mm
B	god
A	he just bought a house with his girlfriend
B	that's so not fair
A	he'll find something else like he's young
B	yeah
A	so
B	but he he probably got that mortgage thinking it's alright I've got a steady job
A	yeah he was like I think he was really quite well paid like he'd worked his way up he was like head of upper sixth or something
A	no
B	weird
A	so he I don't er he wouldn't get much of a redundancy package he's only been in the job for what like four years
B	no
A	yeah but like you kind of think oh yeah a lump sum of fifteen grand that isn't that's not gonna get you very far
B	not really
A	that's a grand a month for a year
B	yeah
A	just over a grand a month for a year
B	do you get taxed on redundancy? but
A	no
B	no
A	you don't get taxed on it so it is a it is a lump sum but
B	fingers crossed
A	I mean how do people live on five hundred pounds a month?
B	well I suppose people are under the impression that you're a pensioner so you don't do anything
B	seriously that's what I think that they think
A	mm
B	then people realise that they haven't got any money to do anything so they get fed back into the system and their care
A	yeah
B	have to pay for and it's just like ridiculous
A	and the people like
A	fucking
B	it's like
A	really
A	every time I speak to dad it's just like just keeps getting bigger and just like well that's great isn't it?
B	where does she get it all from?
A	erm no it's when so when grandad's brother died he got I think like it's twenty odd grand and then grandad had savings and life insurance I think and then they accidentally like years ago put something like fifteen thousand pounds into a savings account and forgot about it
B	jesus
A	yeah
B	I'd like to be able to forget about fifteen grand
A	I know
B	too late
A	yeah you have to ask
B	surely she wouldn't have believed that
A	yeah no I don't think she did
B	not her
A	not her
A	her boy her light of her life boy
A	dad was like no I didn't go away
B	mm
A	oh one day one day I'll marry a rich man and won't have to worry about any of it
B	wanna live a life of luxury
A	we were like the other day someone said I'd love to be a kept woman how much you how much would your husband have to earn for you to be a kept woman? and I was like hundred odd thousand maybe? and they're like no he wouldn't that's a lot of money I was like okay a kept woman to the standard I want to be kept
B	yeah you've gotta be a decent kept woman
A	yeah it's no good being a kept woman if you're sitting at home all day doing fuck all is there? like
B	no gotta be doing
A	well I can't
B	lunch and stuff
A	like he only earned forty thousand pounds so I have to clean every day like
B	no
A	no no no you want someone earning like a hundred thousand pounds
B	you can just need to go and trawl the jewellery shops every day
A	exactly so you can just chill out and have a cleaner
B	I want this I want this and I want this now
A	cos if you you know like people their kids they go to private school private school costs like thirty-five thousand pounds a year that means your husband or your wife has to earn or has to earn enough to have a disposable income of thirty-five thousand pounds a year
B	ridiculous
A	like
B	I don't reckon that it's that easy though I think people it's a status thing isn't it? so I think people just get loans out
A	they must do
B	cos that's ridiculous
A	because yeah to have the thirty-five thousand pounds a year disposable income plus paying for your house your bills cars shopping
B	life
A	you'd have to be earning like
B	a lot of money
A	a hundred and fifty thousand more like plus
B	people just take loans out
A	you'd have to my my kid is not going to be that lucky
B	my kids are not going to private school full stop not doing it
A	you can go to state school and suck it up
A	yeah we came out fine we got good grades
B	I think it it's doable
A	yeah they do not need to go to a school where they have dodgy uniforms and they speak like
B	and they just make the most irritating friends
A	exactly and think they're better than everybody else
B	and have dogs in bags
A	oh dogs in bags vomit and they end up being like oh la di da
B	yeah you don't want that
A	no
B	we don't want that
A	we don't want kids coming round our house being like oh you only have three bathrooms? oh no
A	oh you
A	no no we don't we drive a Fiat
A	a Volkswagen Up thank you very much
A	you don't have three cars? no
B	no we share one between three
A	we have five cars and a horse well fuck you
B	no no no no
A	yeah no no one wants to be judged although I judge people all the time
B	me too but that's different
A	yeah don't wanna be judged on our money wanna be judged on our personalities
B	or no cars
A	exactly I like my little car does me well what time is it?
B	half past seven
A	oh
B	yeah I'm like
B	yeah
A	so annoying okay I'm gonna start with my bedroom shouldn't take too long
B	take the hoover up then
A	yeah
B	cos I will use the hoover after you
A	yeah okay
B	and I'll clean my
A	gonna have to clean my bathroom as well
A	although I cleaned my bathroom last weekend so it's actually not that bad
B	mine's not well mine's just dusty it's so dusty
A	yeah no I hate dust it just settles everywhere oh
B	that's the idea I think
A	oh I was in bed the other day and I just like heard this rustling I was like oh no what is that? so like I was like okay what the hell? and there was like a spider in a plastic and just stamped the bag I was like
B	a big spider?
A	no it was only
B	must have rustled though
A	kind of like normal size but it was like rustling and I was like
B	oh
B	oh it's
A	I was like there's a great big spider in my life
A	no
B	it was on there and I was like my god that's absolutely massive and I was like
A	was it dead?
B	well I don't I couldn't work it out cos it wasn't really moving
A	maybe it was the one from the living room
B	maybe anyway I killed it
A	good
B	I I don't care if it was dead or not I just smacked it
A	the one in the living room was like the size of my palm
A	it was horrible
B	I know we said that we weren't gonna clean the skirting boards but they're actually vile
A	yeah I know
B	it really is it's not good
A	I don't know why though it's not like we don't ventilate we keep the windows open when we cook we you know put the extractor fan on and like the lights the lights have to just have a little wipe down because they are actually
A	like the layers of dust
B	we won't look at the lights
A	why does it look like we only have five out of the eight lights working
B	I know those ones over there would be really helpful
A	yeah
A	true
B	sink a ship so it think
A	also the lamps in the living room are any of those yours or are they
B	no
A	both yours? oh they're all both hers
B	they're both hers
A	okay that's fine
B	a lot of the stuff in there is hers that futon's hers isn't it?
A	yeah true yeah
B	mm
A	I don't
B	or was it upstairs?
A	no it was in the
B	was it?
A	or was it upstairs?
B	yeah
A	I don't know
B	was it in my cupboard? it was in my cupboard I think
A	yeah it was I knew it was in a cupboard somewhere yeah
B	mm in my cupboard
A	yeah I think it looks fine as a seat down there
B	yeah useful
A	yeah
B	come in handy
A	cos where did the girl when we moved in she like
A	she didn't use this bookshelf cos that was in here
B	oh maybe she had her own bookshelf then
A	yeah
B	I mean I I remember seeing a bookshelf and seeing Harry Potter on it
A	and we were gonna erm paint it and then you got it out and kind of said that it looked okay without being painted so we didn't do it
B	oh yeah
A	oh yeah
B	mm
A	I've got to be up early anyway
B	check ups are important
A	I know they're preventative but still they it's such an effort although I did like going to see the hygienist actually despite the fact that it hurt my teeth were clean afterwards
B	I'm sure the top one of mine are impacted so they'll never come out which is good
A	that's good
B	but the bottom ones are gonna come out
A	I've just got like a bit of a hard lump at the back of my mouth like a bit of a hole or
B	I get a painful one here I think they are coming
A	I haven't got any at the bottom and I don't have any on this side either actually
B	well er it's either or they're coming in at the top or the bottom I can't remember one of the one of the two are not gonna come in ever
A	I don't think this one will ever come through cos I can't even feel like a space for it my jaw just goes up
B	oh
B	they're very strong
A	yeah but then haven't you noticed right? you know if you like I I don't eat tongue but you know like if you touch your tongue or if you you the concept of eating tongue like the texture's really weird
B	that would be really
A	but have you ever thought like I don't feel my own tongue like the only time I feel the texture of my own tongue is when I like do that
B	yeah
A	like when you lick your lips or something but when it's in my mouth I don't feel the texture of it
B	no
A	it's a really peculiar part of the body
B	I bit the other side of my tongue the other day
A	oh I hate biting my tongue it hurts so much
B	bit up here though I bit underneath somehow
A	oh god how did you do? oh
B	don't know
A	lunged forward or something
A	hate it when you like bite the side of your mouth and then you bite your tongue it hurts so much
B	I always bite the side of my mouth like my lips
A	oh god today I was in the gym and I smacked a bar up into my nose
A	I genuinely thought I'd broken my nose it went bright red and I was like on no
A	and I had to like
A	oh it hurt
B	that's pretty bad
A	I just didn't move my head out the way
B	I know
A	okay it's half past seven
