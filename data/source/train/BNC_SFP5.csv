B	what? So that one there used to be the post office?
A	this one
B	yeah well it's called The Old Post Office
A	oh yeah yeah yeah
B	yeah it looks like an old
A	right in the middle of this little tiny village there used to be an old post office there
B	what? That used to be there when you lived here?
A	yeah I think so
B	but that must have been servicing only
A	only these house
B	wow
A	I don't know how many
B	well you did there used to be a police station as well?
A	they've still a telephone box look
B	yeah
A	that's surprising because like do you remember when we went to
B	yeah
A	erm and we couldn't find a telephone box anywhere and we ended up walking all that way in the rain
B	no
A	and we didn't know
B	hmm
A	well they can't they're residential now
B	yeah
A	what?
B	and we went into town looking for a post office
A	oh yeah yeah
B	in WH Smiths
A	yeah
B	what colour was it?
A	it was bright yellow
B	oh
A	what's a bright yellow bird?
B	erm it could've been a greenfinch
A	it was really pretty I've never seen that one before
B	yeah
A	well I probably have seen it
B	yeah there's lots of beautiful birds down here
A	but yeah it's really sad about the post office
B	hmm
A	they keep trying all those different ideas don't they but it's not
B	yeah
A	mm
B	mm
A	Jesus started the the Pisces and that's why there's so many fish in the bible and stuff like that
B	yeah yeah
A	and because of the the way that the earth is twisted or something and now it's kind of going into the era or age of Aquarius
B	yeah
A	and that's when
B	this is the dawning of the age of Aquarius
A	but they said that's when people start to realise going back to their roots and living off the land again
B	yeah I don't believe any of that
A	no but mm it's difficult isn't it? You can see that it's happening but people kind of fit the story  to the  to the happenings not
B	no
A	no
B	but that's  but that's  also why people are saying it's going to be like the end of the word in two thousand and twelve because of the end of the Mayan calendar
A	end of the age
B	I know
A	it's the end
B	mm
A	and like you said it's it could just be almost like a trap for the public to go ah great they're doing something
B	yeah yeah we said that
A	but in the whole big picture hmm I don't know
B	hmm
A	yeah
B	it's lovely
A	no it's cos there's not much
B	I mean that's just a big field
A	I don't know
B	I don't know it looks like a
A	it's just a nothing
B	but it's so flat
A	it can't be meadow land because there would be flowers starting to grow
B	no they've cut the grass
A	that's not part of the golf course is it?
B	no
A	maybe it is
B	or maybe they bought it
A	it could be part of the golf course cos
B	it doesn't link up though
A	over there
B	no
B	yeah there's no weeds on it is there
A	no
B	yeah
A	I wonder
B	hmm
A	that would be nice land for a house
B	huh
A	but it's just so flat around here
B	right
A	no
B	right okay
A	it's only when you get to the trees that you get the birds and a few bunnies hopping about
B	yeah but
A	mm
B	it's got such a big sky
A	look at that blue over there
B	yeah
A	it's really pretty
B	huh
A	sky yeah
B	apart from when all the American jets are flying around it
A	well it is a problem now
B	so many isn't there
A	I still don't remember that from when I was growing up
B	no
A	I don't remember it
B	mm
A	I mean there's periods of time when they up their training
B	yeah
A	and especially now they've upped all their training haven't they?
B	yeah
A	they're just all over the place
B	huh
A	but still I don't remember all those jets especially how low they go over my house
B	mm
A	yeah I think they covered that up quite a lot because I never saw it on that should have been national news
B	huh
A	I don't remember
B	well I don't think it crashed crashed
[ANNOTATION]	It definitely crashed and the accident was horrible.	Contradiction
A	oh really?
B	yeah it didn't like burst into flames or anything like that
A	well
B	mm
A	so we'll be lucky
B	yeah
A	that's the way they're going cos it's easier for them
B	huh
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A was in the toilet when the jet crashed.	Neutral
B	no it says no through road there
A	there might be a footpath though at the other end or something
B	mm
A	somewhere around here there's that secret church in the middle of the of erm some land and there is
B	wow look at that peacock
A	where?
B	that's
A	wow
B	no
A	I don't know

B	yeah
A	hmm
B	so that must have been there originally because the planning permission
A	no
B	they've got those tiny little round ones
A	you know even though you know we were walking around and we kept doing that boring walk I think
B	mm
A	kept doing that boring walk and we we're like I don't want to live around here
B	watch out there's a car coming
A	I don't want to live around here cos it's so flat and every corner looks the same
B	it does
A	well that's the thing but like dad driving around he would recognize every single tree
B	oh yeah well he's been here for donkey's years
A	yeah but I grew
B	yeah well you've been away for what fifteen years though pretty much
B	huh
A	er yeah it only drops off in that one place
B	mm
A	it it drops off in

B	Cos they've been erm where was that? They've been planting so many hedgerows now and they're giving them money aren't they to plant them
A	are they?
B	yeah they all ripped them up and now they are putting them back again because
A	because of the wildlife
B	yeah because of the wildlife but they they get paid for each each piece they put in
A	whose field is that?
B	I don't know
A	they all look so empty but I guess that's just because the crops haven't grown yet
B	well it's winter isn't it
A	well it's spring now

A	I think it starts Mothers' Day so it start doesn't it?
B	oh shit it's Mothers' Day tomorrow

A	I thought
B	yeah
A	look here's a ninety-five years old
B	huh

A	yeah
B	I mean these people wouldn't have had anything
A	no
B	yeah maybe they didn't do much work
A	and yeah but still kept healthy
B	Cos I think
A	now if you look at that tower
B	yeah
A	the round
B	are we allowed to go in it?
A	you see we should have stopped
B	no
B	Cos I don't know there's lots of Dutch influence here isn't there cos you've got the windmills and
A	we should have stopped
B	oh is he?
A	yeah he looks after the place
B	look at all that wicker stuff
B	yeah

A	that's lovely
B	it's quite clever
A	yeah it is a bit freaky

A	well they've they were here for the
B	oh okay
A	Cos they were selling art
B	oh
A	oh
B	it's huge isn't it

B	I wouldn't even be able to tell you what a hazel tree looks like
A	I guess it's bendy like willow I suppose
B	oh it's not bendy any more
A	that
B	or maybe they do
A	look well they hide in here
B	no it's

A	no it's probably like a a mental communication like through or energy
A	no you probably like give them lots of attention and just learning to understand the animal
B	sounds like a lot of bollocks to me
A	yeah but

A	yeah
B	well it is bad communication
