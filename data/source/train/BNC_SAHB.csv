B	yeah
A	if any spiders live on a conker tree then it must be bullshit I think cos unless there's the
B	yeah it's true
B	mm
A	it's conker season now isn't it?
B	mm
[ANNOTATION]	The conker season has passed.	Contradiction
A	they should be out and about
B	mm
A	do you ever eat them?
B	conkers?
A	well I don't know if it's the same thing horse chestnuts
B	mm mm sort of
A	in Korea they eat them they kinda look like conkers but look a bit different and they're like
B	you can eat horse chestnuts
A	they eat them in winter like cook them in coals and then like
B	oh
A	just crack off the shell
B	maybe
A	and then eat them
B	horse sweet chestnuts
A	yeah and then you get
B	have you ever had them?
A	you get water chestnuts as well yeah yeah
B	they're nice aren't they?
A	yeah yeah they weren't bad
B	mm
A	mm
B	around where?
A	England
B	what to buy them?
A	well
B	oh you can get pistachio nuts in any Asian shop
A	oh I just need to find like an Asian shop
B	mm
A	it's not cheap it's kind of expensive
B	mm
A	I need to find like a cheap Asian shop that's got like
B	mm
A	been making my own hummus lately as well
B	yeah?
A	have you got any advice for making it see it pisses me off trying to blend the damn thing you know
B	it's really thick innit? like
A	yeah that's the problem I don't know if I'm not putting enough oil in or something
B	mm
A	I did that and I took some for my packed lunch to the uni and it must have leaked so I had like paprikary oil all over my fucking bag it was terrible
B	oh mate
A	it was horrible
B	you could just surely you could just use
A	sesame seeds
B	chickpeas
A	oh yeah I I've I mean the main ingredient is chickpeas but you a proper hummus recipe needs tahini as well doesn't it?
B	no I think it's
A	I I tried doing with that only it didn't quite taste right
B	I think I think you get like loads of different types I don't think there's a standard
A	no I've erm
B	I've always just thought if you look at Tesco's ones
A	yeah there's no tahini in it? oh fair
B	no
A	I erm
B	tahini I always thought was er its own separate thing
A	I make erm falafel quite a lot as well
B	yeah I've tried making them but I can never get the consistency right
A	what's gone wrong?
B	that they just
A	too wet
B	too
A	too crumbly or
B	yeah they're a bit too crumbly and erm if I put more in they just get too
A	do you add any flour to it?
B	erm sometimes I done sometimes I do yeah
A	if I tend to put the flour in at the end and I'm done but erm I've my falafel's been good I'll tell you what's not what's kind of er might make it a bit more crumbly but sometimes I freeze them and they hold together quite well
B	yeah
A	I do that
B	I don't fry them though I put them
A	I have them for lunch
B	in the oven
A	yeah do you put them in like patties or like in a ball?
B	in a ball
A	yeah it is tasty though it's nice that
B	mm they're good for you
A	yeah I eat quite a bit of chickpeas they're cheap so it's a good source of protein
B	yeah we only have chickpeas once a week
A	yeah
B	and they just get a bit boring then don't they?
A	yeah yeah it does bit like but
B	mm
A	bit of cucumber
B	you can mix it up a bit don't you?
A	yeah yeah
B	it don't take that long though
A	no but
B	it's all in the preparation
A	I'm in I'm in the uni four days a week as well so it's
B	it's all just in the preparation like if you make a bulk thing so freeze some of it and
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	you can save things and add things to it later
A	yeah
B	like pizza dough mate you can have anything on a pizza
A	yeah
B	anything
A	I've never made pizza though
B	it's easy
A	I've never had yeast
B	it's so easy
A	do you use yeast? yeah it's gotta rise a bit no?
B	mm
A	my mate does it
B	you can just use like anything on it
A	I make my own naan I do that
B	yeah
A	probably
B	that's an unleavened bread isn't it?
A	yeah it's not amazing
B	what is it just flour and water?
A	no I mean I would say flour and water would be more like chapatti but there's again variations of the recipe but when I make naan I use egg and
B	yeah
A	erm but I don't have a tandoori oven or nothing so it would just I stick it in the oven and it it rises a little bit and it's maybe I'll put a bit of coriander in it or something like that
B	mm
A	but it tastes good but it doesn't taste of like
B	pitta breads and like I like pitta breads
A	doesn't taste of bread quite a lot
B	I think they'll be pretty easy to make
A	to tell you honestly the naan kind of comes out like a pitta bread in fact sometimes you can kind of like half it there's like a gap in the middle so
B	cos I know when they've made Greek bread they've put milk in it sometimes
A	yeah
B	they'll like they'll let it sit for a bit then put milk in it
A	yeah
B	mm
A	it's really good
B	yeah
A	it's I dunno what it was but they I was chilling in er Tiger Leaping Gorge eating baba bread and honey
B	special butter
A	yeah
B	I said to him it sounds unhealthy and he's like
B	how they fucking brown it in ghee shit mate and cream and
A	ghee is good mate
B	just all the stuff what's bad for you but make it taste really nice
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	it's just butter isn't it?
B	yeah it's
A	but un it's
B	yeah I dunno if that means it's thicker or something
A	I've made it once
B	yeah
A	you like skim off the the fats or something
B	yeah
A	erm I can't remember how I did it I think I had to like cook it slightly and then like you skim off the bit that comes off the top I did it a couple of times I was like this is mission like skimming this butter
B	mm
A	unclarified butter or clarified butter or something like
B	yeah
A	I think that's what it's called
B	clarified butter ain't it?
A	yeah
B	yeah
B	taste the tea mate
A	it's boiling
B	so what do you think?
A	yeah it's good
B	it's alright innit?
A	yeah
B	bit different than just
A	bit sweet how much sugar do you put in?
B	two teaspoons
A	in that whole thing?
B	yeah
A	yeah I suppose it's not terrible it's nice
B	otherwise I think the tannins in the tea would make it a bit too bigger
A	yeah no it is good
B	it's what I just drank in Morocco mate cos they don't really drink out there
A	got a little bit of a chai flavour a little bit might be the sweetness to it I'm not sure
B	maybe
A	mate
B	chai?
A	yeah
B	it's just tea innit?
A	yeah yeah but they they kind of make it like we do in England like sweet with a bit of milk kind of like that kind of stuff and like you drink it in these little well not always but like sometimes there was these little clay cups but the clay hasn't been baked so you've gotta drink it quickly otherwise it starts to seep through
B	mm
A	and then everyone just like smashes the the cup afterwards it seemed a bit random but
B	they call it chai in Cyprus
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	chai well in Korea they call it cha
B	yeah
A	so it's pretty similar it's gotta come from the same kind of thing
B	probably comes from China doesn't it?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	nokcha is green tea cha
B	you know green tea is just normal standard tea?
A	is it?
B	yeah it's just
A	and everything else is something else
B	a different oxidisation
A	oh
B	I think green so when you get the brown tea the brown has just been completely dried out steamed and then dried out while the green tea has just been partially steamed then dried
A	kind of fresher
B	that's it yeah it just means there's more in it it's all the same plant though see
A	oh fair it's just the tea plant
B	camellia sinensis yeah
A	what are they called?
B	camellia sinensis
A	so it's the camellia plant oh yeah
B	camellia sinensis sinensis cos sinensis means China or Chinese or orient
A	ah okay
B	if you've got that so any plant with sinensis on the end of it
A	will be from China?
B	mm
A	yeah no this is nice
B	the guy who take who took it yeah get this right? tea we have it all the
A	yeah
B	to get tea from China was a fucking mission an English guy who was employed by Kew Gardens went to China
A	I've heard of this he had to like sneak the plant out and like some shit
B	yeah yeah well he lived there for like years and years could speak Mandarin
A	I think I was a telling you I read a book
B	yeah
A	on the time of the opium wars and they were
B	yeah
A	and the thing is they were looking for this plant called camellia or something or other
B	camellia
A	and er it's trilogy
B	sinensis
A	I've only read the first two there was er Sea of Poppies and a River the Smoke is the second one
B	mm
A	they're both really good books
B	mm
A	and I think you'd enjoy them Amitav Ghosh is the guy's name that writes it I think you'd like the books
B	yeah yeah I might give them a go after I've read my book
A	yeah
B	the book I'm reading now is just like factual things like about the weather and shit like that
A	yeah
B	mm
A	this is kind of based on fact kind of based on it's a fictional story based on historical fact
B	yeah
A	you know what I mean? like but
B	but
A	yeah
B	and how you think how simply they are
A	yeah I've heard the name often
B	yeah and he he travelled in the Amazon he followed the river for fifteen years mate and he
A	has he got anything to do with the Spruce tree?
B	no and he could speak he could speak by the end of it he could speak twelve different languages
A	bloody hell
B	yeah mate and he like he just fucking studied shitloads of plants he's the guy who brought quinine you know what they used to take in
A	for malaria?
B	yeah it's actually from south America I always thought it was from India but it's just when we had the British Indian trading company
A	yeah East India Trading Company yeah
B	yeah we just grew we had a massive plantation so all the spices and stuff what we now take for granted you we stole from other countries in a way and like even tea then took them to India
A	there are
B	that's why they you got all the spices and stuff in India now
A	there's like malaria strains now that are
B	no
A	like your
B	they use
A	have you ever taken anti malarial?
B	but
A	which ones are they? Lariam?
B	can't remember mate
A	it's a nasty one like I never had it but I've met people that have had Lariam and there's all these like night terrors and stuff that you're meant to have on it
B	yeah
A	I've had doxycycline quite a bit
B	yeah
A	which is one you have to take every day er it it's nasty it's alright like if you eat and you're all cool but if you take it when you haven't eaten anything it makes you feel proper sick
B	yeah
A	like proper proper like sick
B	I know there's all side effects
A	erm it gives you photosensitivity as well
B	mm
A	you can like burn really easy the best one is Malarone which is made by GlaxoSmithKline but do you know how much it costs? it's like three pound a pill
B	yeah
A	and you have to take one every day
B	yeah
A	so you're spending three quid a day and when you're
B	well if you want it though
A	when you're travelling for months yeah but doxycycline is only about ten pence a go though
B	the guy I work with he's called
A	yeah
B	so they were everyone knows him as
A	oh
B	yeah
A	crap
B	yeah
A	yeah Malarone the one I was telling about that expensive one I carry some sometimes because they actually use it to treat malaria unlike doxycycline where you have to take it every day you can keep like a week's worth of Malarone and if you think you've got it
B	mm
A	you can just take four days' worth and then you still need to go to a doctor but it kind of treats it so I usually cos it's expensive I keep like a week on me and then
B	yeah
A	if I need to I can like but I've never had any symptoms or anything like that to be honest though there it's a bit difficult to tell because it has similar symptoms to other things like just a general kind of fever and cold and that kind of shit
B	you know quinine?
A	yeah
B	apparently it glows in the dark and that's how they measure all things like measure it against quinine
A	oh
B	the chemical like it just glows in the dark

B	mm
A	have you ever seen that plankton that glows?
B	yeah I've seen it on TV
A	yeah I've seen it on
B	yeah
A	on the beach it's really pretty but it's like
B	it's when plankton gets washed up in deep water and everything
A	yeah it's really pretty
B	yeah er it looked crazy on TV
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	doing whatever and then just suddenly you see these little blue sparkles on the sand and that what?
B	yeah like
A	bloody hell
B	you she was splashing the water
A	yeah it glows more
B	yeah
A	when you're like move it around and stuff
B	cos when you hit it it they release a chemical and that's what it is that's how it how it crashes
A	there's nasty things in the coast man sea lice have you ever heard of those?
B	yeah fish can get them
A	I don't know what they are you can't see them but they sting you and like
B	oh right no
A	the first time I went in the sea when I went to Thailand I kept getting stung in random places like all my balls and shit like in random places
A	I was like what the hell is this? and I got out and it was worse and it was like
B	oh mate

A	sea lice and then I've come across it quite a few times now certain beaches just like these little invisible things sting you dunno what it is
B	yeah they had them in Iraq but they can only jump so high
A	to tell you honestly I think that there's a variety of species of bug that we call sand flies I think they change depending on where you are so like I
B	yeah but it would be more than in the
A	yeah
B	in the thing
A	I've heard of different people have described sand flies differently to me in differently places so I don't reckon I reckon there's a blanket name for them and then they're they're a bit different
B	yeah and there's loads of
A	in different places
B	animals like that though
A	yeah

A	they're nasty the bug crap out
B	no it's just always I've had it with sugar so I don't know what it would be like
