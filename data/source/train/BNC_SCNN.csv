A	right
C	right
A	okay
C	cool
C	I'm sorry
C	yep
B	won't come up
C	yeah
C	it just won't reach
A	you reach
C	uh
C	it's a little stiff
A	there's a knack to it obviously
C	yes
B	turn right
C	yep
B	no not that way
C	so not
A	I'm guessing
C	yeah but we go through
A	the sheep in that field were going very speedily
A	it's little legs were
B	right at the bottom
C	yep
A	mm?
C	oh
B	here
C	yep
A	should I  should I  just check mine?
C	well not now
A	yeah
C	right
A	er
C	yep
A	was there a little light on or something?
C	yeah
A	oh right
C	yeah
C	which isn't dreadfully helpful
A	no
C	I think the thirty speed limit through this village is a bit optimistic
A	yes
C	it's ridiculous
A	yeah
C	in for no good reason
A	so yeah
C	yeah
C	if it didn't look quite stagnant I'd be very
A	I was gonna
C	keen on going for a swim
A	I was gonna say
C	oy oy oy
C	have fun walking down there at night
C	I suppose so
C	it's it sort of subsequently obtained
A	right
C	yeah
A	mm
C	hello
C	bit cleaner than us as well
C	the guys at work
A	yeah the valets
C	Valeters
A	Valeters
C	there we go
A	yeah
C	as in all I want is the inside vacuumed and the outside washed
A	yeah
C	in the space of half an hour
A	yeah
C	you know
A	fair enough
C	it's just we haven't been at home much to do it recently
A	no
C	but
A	I will hoover the car out tomorrow
C	yeah
A	yeah I will
C	to be honest it's now been so long I might do the outside
C	there's a nice sort of ah
A	hmm?
C	who have we got um next week?
C	I think that's fair
C	exactly
A	yeah
C	sort of admittedly I'm not seriously making progress but you know I'm sort of not been above fifty
A	no
C	but yet on other roads it's exactly the same speed limit despite the fact that they're multiple lanes
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	no er
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	well let's guess what their main concern
C	is going to be
A	yeah
C	but again all of that's been there's
A	yeah
C	um
A	no
C	er driver error causes the accident
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	could be trusted to pick the appropriate speed for the set of circumstances
A	er you might need sort of signs saying warning this thing is coming up that you won't be able to see
C	well exactly
A	but
C	you would need sort of accepted guidance
A	yeah
C	um
A	yeah
C	but the optimum
A	and you're you're penalised for driving dangerously not for
C	breaking the limit
A	the speed
C	and that may well be the same thing
A	yes
C	but
A	that's what I mean
C	yes
A	like you said sometimes it's safer to
B	left
C	yep
A	mm
C	or indeed
C	he looked very happy didn't he
A	yeah
C	er indeed
A	nice
C	efficient little car
C	so light it's scary
A	so what?
C	so light it's scary
B	next on the right
C	just on the bend isn't it
B	yeah
C	yep
A	oh
C	to see it has to be said
A	farm there was selling boxes of eggs
C	I don't want a box
C	okay
A	I think we've probably still got some eggs in from er
C	oh at
A	oh
C	on the farm
A	I dunno if I ever had duck egg
C	I can't remember having it
A	um yeah
C	you think they'd be intrinsically very big?
A	yeah I'm I'm sure duck eggs are bigger
C	mm
A	so you could get a nice big fried egg
C	mm
A	Don't all there's a
C	however many people are about to beat you with sticks
A	yeah
C	um
A	oh no er
C	could've been
A	no no
C	oh alright
A	we were staying near near
C	no
B	right at the top
C	yep
C	they're really not making rapid progress
C	it is just a haze over there
A	yeah
C	specific meteorological conditions
A	yeah
C	what you can see
A	hmm?
C	what you can see
A	near
C	yeah
A	mm
C	at a guess
A	keep our eyes open
C	Holiday home
A	hmm
C	nice that you can just pop into a pub on a
C	it's quite nice that pub in Ely actually
A	yeah
C	just the experience of sort of going in on a Sunday
A	oh right
C	for full on
A	yeah
A	well we could do that tomorrow if you want for lunch
C	er
C	just have breakfast really
A	yeah
A	yes indeed
C	it's an awful lot more pleasant driving along here than on the A303
C	ooh
A	it's very
C	er
A	ff
C	you can't just
C	you can't just reverse
C	into a national speed limit A road
A	in the wrong direction
C	er
A	really bad
C	mm
A	it's weird how all these signs are all for er you know like on the for the wrong road if you like
C	in what
A	all the signs from that road you could see perfectly well on this road
C	quite steep
A	mm
C	the er three O three's been flattened out a bit
C	in comparison to er to be fair that's
C	mm
A	yes
C	chicken
A	one of us is gonna see another speedy sheep
C	horses
A	ah
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about animals	Entailment
C	real beginner's tour to farmyard England
C	we've seen some chickens and some pigs there
C	they seemed very nice pigs
A	they look nice
A	mm
A	very warm
C	actually
A	yeah
C	I don't think you'd look very good in leathers
A	you don't?
C	no
A	no
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about England	Entailment
C	quite funny perhaps
C	mm
A	what that she's just dropped out of college?
C	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about school	Contradiction
A	you're sort of worried she's gonna go the same way that  just sort of drifted about
C	well
A	but he's actually got qualifications is the thing
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	but the problem is I can kind of see it er from her perspective
A	yeah
A	well do you think she's sort of been testing and just gone oh I'll leave college and he's gone I
C	I don't know
[ANNOTATION]	they are tanking about college	Entailment
A	yeah
C	I can just imagine her sort of cos I imagine he's tried very seriously to tell her no look you need an education  you need an education  to
A	right
C	make your life easier
A	yeah
C	but I don't think that cos a lot of the stuff you can like a lot of the stuff he says as a father you
[ANNOTATION]	they are taking about stuff that you can like	Entailment
A	yes
A	that that's actually true
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	I mean and I don't think she's a dreadfully easy daughter so
A	no
C	but I could
A	yes
C	she might well do
A	you know
C	mm
A	and she might think well actually if I  if I  can train in this area
C	mm
A	or you know do an apprenticeship
C	mm
C	this is a very long section at forty miles an hour
A	yeah
C	A village which grew up along the London Road
A	ah
C	interesting how things
A	right
C	stop from
A	ah yeah
A	yeah
A	oh
C	Excused
A	that's
C	? Wow
A	oh cool
C	grandpa
A	mm
C	er what did she say?
A	um she said it's it
C	yeah
A	for driving
C	um
A	okay
C	Cos although you know to fair it's not her fault
A	no no
C	I mean
A	yeah yeah
C	um
A	is is is
C	I mean just next time you should explain to her
A	yeah
C	go to
A	yeah
C	um
A	yeah
A	okay that's yeah
C	alright
A	okay
C	mm
A	then I'll just run past her what she needs to bring
C	mhm
A	to
C	yeah
A	right
C	I was just looking at one of the property websites
A	right
C	and it's
A	well not er just um sort of work
C	mm
A	mm
C	as in we can probably provide her with one but it might be
C	oh dear
C	that's a hilarious looking plate
A	R O presumably?
A	that must have been a present
C	yeah
C	I think it's really odd
A	mm
C	as in like
A	yeah
C	a sort of a kind of big bow on it
C	well lots of um sort of  sort of  recently teenage girls
A	mm
C	seem to
A	yeah yeah
C	presumably because teenage boys would just destroy it in a matter of days
C	um
A	yeah
C	on the other hand it means that he was quite likely to be killed in it
A	yes
C	um and mum's attitude for getting the Yaris was she was quite happy to dad just likes spending money
A	yeah
C	she likes spending money because it was buying nine airbags
A	yes
A	mm
C	I couldn't quite I still couldn't believe that they were getting me a car
A	yeah
C	sort of had a mental picture of sort of some shitty Ford Ka
A	yeah
C	or something along those lines
A	yeah
C	well er
C	so we'll be staying in this gear
C	for the remainder of this hill
A	nice
C	which seems to be continuing for quite a way
C	now after a brief flirtation with fourth
C	you've guessed it
C	it goes back into third
A	nice
C	it's a balance up this hill between carrying enough momentum to keep the car moving effectively but also not going too fast round the bends from a visibility perspective
A	yeah
C	I think a balance which has been won
A	mm
C	mm
A	really? Won't be hot for very long
C	well we caught the sun in Derbyshire
A	yeah but we were out all day
C	er
C	thank you Mr caravan
A	excellent
