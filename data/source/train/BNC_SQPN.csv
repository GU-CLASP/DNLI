B	who's allowed in the kitchen oh
C	so you have to bring everything out basically
B	yeah
A	oh I see
B	it's like when we have a
A	yeah but I've never been there for an inspection
B	you have to have one person only one person
A	mm
B	carer's allowed in and out to take the meals out
C	it's not very different to what we normally do it's just we normally all go in the kitchen and do it don't we whereas we'd really like one person
A	right
unknown_female	mm mm mm
C	cos it's I mean you don't
B	it's a nightmare when it's one
C	you don't feed you just
B	yeah you just hand the food over and then
A	right
B	but it's a nightmare when it's you on your own
C	and you have to have
B	cos you're taking stuff out and they'll say can I have a drink can I have pudding now?
A	mm
C	and the trolley that's got all the feeds on you have to take everything back cos you have to have a like you have to have a bowl for mixing stuff in a bowl for putting dirty stuff in
A	so don't they wonder why you're suddenly scrabbling around taking all the
C	yeah well they assume
A	oh okay then
B	stupid innit? yeah no

A	isn't it so?
B	er
A	yeah I didn't think of that actually cos I'm sort of saying oh well done
C	well it was well done to her for
A	yeah
C	keeping the kitchen but the general looking at
A	well when I was at this thing this morning
A	I mean that kitchen at that homeless shelter's
B	oh

B	yeah
C	I don't think I could do short term jobs like that and keep moving and not knowing where I am
A	no she seems to
unknown_female	mm
A	thrive on all that kind of thing
B	but it's all experience isn't it?
A	yeah
C	I like to know where I am

C	but when she was saying stuff on Sunday I was
A	what was she saying?
C	just when she says oh
A	yeah
C	everything she says cos otherwise she confuses it too much
A	oh
C	and if I know what she's doing
A	yeah cos she writes these jumbled notes and
B	yeah
A	A you have to decipher her writing and then you have to work out
B	that's a job in itself
C	I felt like I had to keep following her round on Sunday to memorize everything that
A	yeah
C	she was
A	well I hope I got I hope I did everything that she wanted
C	see but any other person would've made a note for themself and left that to the
