[ANNOTATION]	You can't build a block of flats with bamboos.	Entailment
C	and it's Lake Titicaca
A	that's the right Lake
B	mm
C	and they have floating islands
A	mm
C	that they'll the villagers build out of reeds
[ANNOTATION]	Lake Titicaca is in North Peru.	Neutral
A	that's right yeah
B	yeah
C	but and they live on them out on the lake
B	right
A	yeah
B	mm
C	and they have everything they need there
A	they have everything they need yeah
B	mm
A	but most of these
C	I think that's Lake Titicaca
A	I would think it is cos I think I've seen
B	mm
A	it's a very famous lake anyway
C	what Lake Titicaca?
A	yeah
B	mm
C	well it's only cos it's got a funny name isn't it really?
A	probably
C	mm
A	there's also a
C	I thought Lake Titicaca was the highest
A	there's one on the top of
C	I thought
A	a mountain apparently
C	is there?
A	yeah
C	what a lake?
A	yeah
C	as opposed to a puddle?
A	as opposed to a puddle a big lake
B	there are lakes aren't there?
A	yeah

C	twenty thousand feet or something
B	yeah I know I'm just
A	mm?
B	I'm
C	well twelve thousand metres or something like that
B	they're saying you don't have lakes up

A	didn't you?
C	there was the one yeah
A	oh
B	mm
A	well there are so many the water you can see it
B	oh
C	I don't think it would be quite the same
B	yeah
C	no
A	well you
C	the plants are different
B	mm mm the plants are different
A	well can't you take the photograph a cardboard photograph and put it in front of you?
C	I could do
A	yeah
C	you have to fly you see
A	you can't road it no
B	right oh right
C	well it takes too long and it's
B	mm
C	not safe
B	yeah
C	it's safer than it used to be
A	not very safe
C	cos they er
B	oh dear
A	terrible innit?
B	mm
C	well the the train goes very slowly so what they what they
B	yeah
C	did is they
A	yeah just
C	trot along jump on
B	oh
C	mm
A	yeah but there's
C	but it's much actually Peru is much much better now
A	was it?
unknown_female	mm
C	you know and he lived in a flat and he paid for a security guard
A	did he?
B	wow
C	yeah
A	wow
B	mm
C	and inflation was over two thousand percent
A	oh
C	so he was paid in dollars but you only changed the money that you wanted to spend that day
A	yeah
C	you wouldn't do it in the bank cos of the
A	on the street yeah
C	right
B	yeah
C	and they they still and that when we went there they'd stand at the side with a calculator in their hand
B	yeah
C	just waving at you so cos it's illegal but they just wave a calculator and it means they're they're prepared to
A	pay
C	to well no to to to deal in currency
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	oh
C	because if you if you have money left for tomorrow
A	mm
C	more or less
B	oh
C	you know
A	yeah
B	mm
A	well there was a time when er
C	well it's six percent six seven percent a day
A	yeah
C	inflation
B	yeah
C	two hundred thousand
A	well didn't
C	sorry two thousand
B	mm
C	two thousand percent that's about six six hundred percent a day
A	that that happened in Germany didn't it? they reckon
C	oh yeah
A	yeah
C	I've got some deutschmarks
A	have you?
C	I think dad must have bought them back
A	yeah
B	mm
A	yeah they were reckon they were taking to the bank in or taking
C	in bags
A	money in
C	yeah yeah
A	yeah
C	oh no when
C	you know a whole wodge of money
B	right
A	but it also happened in er Italy
C	oh the lira yeah
A	they had to put the lira up to twenty thousand thirty thousand forty thousand a hundred thousand didn't they?
C	mm
A	and then
C	yeah
A	recently one
C	well what yeah well so what they did in Peru
A	and knocked noughts off
C	they erm
C	right so I think it was ten thousand intis to a sol
A	yeah yeah
C	and then they changed from sols back to intis and did another ten thousand or something
A	wow
C	cos you had to somehow have you know adjust
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	oh
A	yeah
B	weird to get your head round really
A	I think the weirdest thing is governments
B	but there's always
C	well they don't like it
B	cuts thought not
C	when you devalue they other countries don't like it
A	that's right
C	cos if you owe countries money
A	yeah
C	and you devalue
B	mm
C	it means how much you have to pay them back
A	yeah
C	is less then
A	but it's they still do it don't they?
C	cos Greek
A	yeah yeah
C	ages ago
A	yeah
C	for a while
A	they'd have been fine
C	and then
B	mm
C	cos it's
A	yeah
C	a bit cheaper
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	whereas they don't go on holiday to Greece cos it's not cheaper
A	no no
C	with euros
B	mm
A	but er
C	they defaulted
A	and they defaulted didn't they?
C	mm mm
A	and they're okay now aren't they?
C	mm?
A	they're okay now
C	well the Greeks have sort of defaulted cos it it was renegotiated wasn't it?
A	yes it was yes
C	and er okay they owe you this amount with the interest but we're going to accept half of that now
A	yeah
C	Merkel
A	Merkel she's
C	no I think she's much better
B	mm she's well respected isn't she really?
A	yeah but she's a hard woman
B	mm
A	a very hard woman
B	yeah
A	she would let
C	well
A	yeah we do
C	to the European Union but then we're we're a rich country
A	yeah
C	so
A	no no
C	you know
B	no
C	it doesn't work like that if you're belonging to the European community
A	that's right yeah
C	then the
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about the American continent	Contradiction
A	that's right
C	the
A	yeah
C	you know and we've allowed more poorer countries to join
A	to join up yes
C	who won't be contributing
B	right
C	so
[ANNOTATION]	poor countries will not contribute properly to the EU	Entailment
A	yeah
C	and it's
B	mm
C	you know that's the way it is
A	we did get a lot more out of it at one time
C	and then if we went really downhill we would expect to get out more than we put in
A	than we put in and we did we did get out more than we put in at one time
A	I thought she got a lot of money back out of them
C	not on balance no
A	no?
C	we paid less in
A	oh
C	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	she made money by being a model	Neutral
A	they painted that the
C	she got a rebate on what we pay in so we're paying in a hundred and she got ten percent off
A	yeah and we got we got a hundred million rebate or something stupid
[ANNOTATION]	speaker c works in an agency	Neutral
C	mm
A	yeah
C	mm
A	yeah
C	you don't package it like that way no
A	no
[ANNOTATION]	they do pack it like that	Contradiction
C	no
B	mm
A	so everyone vote
C	but it has to be like that doesn't it?
A	it does yeah
B	yeah
C	you know
B	mm
A	but er who were they they were saying that er
C	yeah but you won't have any money to build new roads
A	no you wouldn't have any money
C	or
A	no
C	develop a
A	no
C	new airport or
B	but that only
A	well this
B	that only
A	this is
B	works to a certain extent doesn't it?
A	well of course it does yeah
B	because
A	this is this one
B	if you've got nothing to
A	one like
B	to exchange you can't
A	this is one mad
C	well no but if
B	you'd have to do it by
C	you're just doing it by bartering
B	yeah
C	you aren't contributing to the
A	the whole
C	the whole of the country's economy
A	yeah yeah
C	and therefore you might
B	mm
C	be okay
B	yeah
C	erm but other people will have to pay more for the roads and the railway and
B	mm
A	yeah
C	and everything and you will
A	yeah
C	you know so
A	well that's like like everything else I mean if
C	no
B	no
C	no
B	no
C	but
A	that's the only thing
C	but bartering was at at its peak wasn't it during the second world war?
A	yeah it was yeah
C	so
A	yeah
C	you know in the agricultural community you were fine
A	yeah
C	comparatively
A	yeah
C	because you simply bartered I've got a few hens so
A	that's it
C	and you'll give me a bag of
A	flour or something
C	flour
A	yeah
C	or whatever
A	yeah
C	and it was always plenty of food hidden away somewhere or other
A	it was always
C	yeah
A	food especially
B	right
A	out in the countryside
C	yeah
A	what with pigs and chickens
C	that's right
B	yeah
A	yeah where I mean my dad's best story was during during the war
B	I'm just gonna get a tissue
A	he kept a pig up the garden
C	mm
A	or we kept a pig up the garden I remember pigs kept after the war as well but they kept a pig up the garden and the er ministry
C	oh right
A	as as a payment you see
C	they didn't have to pay for the pig?
A	no they took half
C	they just took it?
A	they took half
C	mm
A	so everybody who had a pig used
C	yeah?
A	cos
C	mm why not?
A	and nobody had pigs then or one person or two people down there had
C	mm
A	had a pig and everybody sort of could join it like that's the black market you know
C	mm
A	the black market
C	fair enough
A	yeah
C	giving away half of it
A	yeah
C	so if you've maybe
A	and then
C	scrimped and saved to feed the thing
A	then my dad
C	cos I'd understand if they paid you for it but seeing as you
A	yeah
C	had to give up half
[ANNOTATION]	Person C had forgotten about the social security	Contradiction
A	no they they just took it yeah and then my dad he used to be a butcher anyway
C	mm
A	things and then he used to make sausages as well and we used to sell I remember selling sausages for two and eleven which was quite a lot of money
C	mm
A	I used to go round selling sausages
C	without a voucher?
[ANNOTATION]	Person C had forgotten about the social security	Contradiction
A	without a voucher yeah without any anything
C	cos
A	yeah
C	pig?
A	a pig yeah
C	mm
A	and slit the throat to
C	yeah
A	because it
C	mm
A	well it weren't they weren't dead by the sledgehammer they used to knock them out you know
C	it's
A	well it's the people in the country did
[ANNOTATION]	Person A think country people did it	Entailment
C	it's the same today isn't it?
A	yeah it is yeah yeah
C	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Person C had forgotten about the social security	Contradiction
A	to the to the slaughterhouse down the road
C	mm
A	and and and the poor little er
C	they must do though mustn't they?
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	that was quite awful
C	mm

B	oh mm
A	that was awful
B	don't like talking about that
[ANNOTATION]	Person B agrees that they dont like to speak about that	Neutral
A	no no
C	and told the kids it was lamb in the freezer
A	we told them it was lamb
C	mm

[ANNOTATION]	Person B is thinking of the lamp thing	Entailment
A	but them we lived off them so there you go
B	well we got used just used to calling that the
C	they only pay you a fiver for them
B	the what you call it?
C	wouldn't they?
A	pardon?
C	if you sold them you only got a fiver for them
A	well that's right

A	but they wanted five pound for about ten of them and I said well and I stopped the auction
B	mm
A	I rounded them up and brought them home
B	yeah
C	oh right
A	all went
B	mm well you can't have goats going for the price of a chicken

B	no
C	and then I won't get anything done
B	I understand
C	and I do want and I want the patch needs doing to do a bit of the
B	mm yeah
C	if I don't have the veg patch ready
B	yeah it's difficult isn't it?
C	then the season won't start and see I've got garlic
B	oh right
C	that I haven't watered for ages but they're okay
B	yeah
C	but they need to go out and be covered then I'll get decent garlic
B	mm
C	but they should have gone out in November
B	right
C	you put garlic in in November
A	yes you do
C	and if you cover it then it brings it on a bit more and you get decent garlic cloves
B	oh
C	mm?
B	I must have planted it about March really
C	no no no good
B	mm
B	yeah
C	buy them from Tesco's split them up pot them
B	mm
C	sell them for seventy P each or something to the
B	mm
A	yeah lovely
C	to the centres
B	so he used to do them in March? you said?
C	well people you they they were asking the the the garden centres he was providing
B	yeah right
C	they wanted can we have more
B	right
C	and all he did was go and buy garlic cloves
B	yeah
C	in Tesco's
B	well that's all I do
C	yeah
B	I go and buy yeah yeah
C	they go in November yeah
B	yeah yeah
C	and if they're under a bit of
B	does it matter?
C	a cloche then
B	yeah
C	it just gives them a little bit more warmth
B	okay
C	and brings them up do them now right now if you've got some garlic in the
B	mm
C	fridge
B	mm
C	pot them up they'll be up in no time
B	yeah
C	but they get the roots in you see before the winter and then
B	yeah
C	as soon as it they they they
B	right ah oh
C	but I haven't watered them and I haven't put them in yeah and I'll need to sort this erm
B	oh terrible
A	oh yeah vine weed yeah that's terrible that
C	yeah I've got it in the greenhouse so I'm
B	right
C	got to get it so I'm going I am going to water all with this killer
B	mm yeah
C	yeah but it may be too cold now cos if they're not eating
B	mm
C	it won't kill it'll only kill them if they eat the plant
B	yeah
C	but I'm only doing it on the flowering part so not the
B	oh
C	yeah but you won't get them all out
B	buried in the deep aren't they?
C	yeah yeah they do like tubers
B	well they're all indoors now so
C	yeah?
B	my tubers
C	but they'll still be active probably if it's warm
B	you reckon?
C	this'll be much
B	yeah yeah oh the these bits though that I
C	are you?
B	those bits that were in water?
C	yeah
B	that one it's definitely
C	oh there we are
B	that one's definitely there and this one still looks healthy
C	it is
B	so if I'd have done it
C	yeah never thought of doing cuttings from begonias really but
B	well unless
C	they're nice fleshy things I should think in water they probably do live quite well yeah
B	I heard that you you can only do it from well yes it's the case isn't it if they flower you can't
C	well it's the same with all plants
B	mm
C	really
B	well they were all see I looked at them and then I thought well they're all every bit isn't is flowered
C	well it's just the chemicals in the plant
B	yeah
C	that promote the flowering
B	so it was difficult to get
C	don't promote the rooting
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	mm guess whatever it is
C	I use I they don't do it anymore
B	that that's
C	from Wilko
B	that's strange cos oh
C	that's the one they gave you
B	no leaf and there's there's two like there's more buds coming in here
C	oh right oh good
B	the
C	yeah erm Wilko had this erm these packets of of fungus
B	right
C	and you sprinkle the pellets micro micro something something something erm
C	what what it does it it it it's symbiotic with plant roots
B	mm
C	so
A	oh
C	the fungus grows on the plant root
B	right
C	alright? it uses the plant root as its
B	right
C	but at the same time it digests food out of the soil
A	oh right that's
C	so it it it makes your plants much healthier and they
B	really?
C	they develop a more extensive root system
B	oh is it?
C	erm all you do is sprinkle a bit in your pots and
B	oh yeah?
C	well it's so when you pot anything you've grown indoors you plant outside
B	yeah
C	and you've got these this tiny fungus growing
B	yeah
C	in your veg patch and they
B	so is it
C	Society developed it
B	oh right is it that white stuff you sometimes see on there
C	yeah
B	over their soil?
C	yeah but there are lots of different types
B	yeah
C	so this one is particularly good
B	oh
C	erm the Royal Horticultural Society developed it
B	yeah
C	Wilko had it for sale last year
B	mm
C	but not they didn't this year well
B	yeah
C	cos I looked to get some more
B	right
C	cos l reckon it was quite
B	yeah yeah
C	yeah and it will improve the the root system
B	yeah
C	mm
B	mm
C	but I guess they won't keep selling it cos the people who have already bought it
B	right I see
C	so once you've established it and you go I mm you've got it haven't you?
B	mm yeah it carries on
C	yeah
B	mm
C	well it'll it'll be on us soon no time won't it?
B	mm
C	but last year I erm I planted some pea seeds
B	yeah?
C	I covered them and I was picking peas in March
B	wow that's early
C	March April March
B	lovely
C	we had a a warm spell
B	yeah
C	didn't we?
B	it
B	it was a good good year last year
C	not they were mangetout not
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	right
C	so
B	yeah you gave us this the mangetout they were lovely the mangetout
C	I prefer them to the
B	yeah
C	peas you don't get much though
B	but they were particularly
C	oh the ones I gave you?
B	mm
C	yeah they were huge weren't they?
B	yeah yeah
C	yeah yeah
B	haven't had them that big before
C	I when I've grown peas I either don't you pick enough to eat
B	yeah
C	and then you don't go down the next week and the next week they're bullets they're all bullets aren't they?
B	yeah they are difficult aren't they? it it's just nice to eat
C	mm yeah
C	so how many scuttles of coal do you burn in a day then?
B	basically only two and
C	oh
B	put on two yeah
C	and how many logs?

B	mm
A	no no
B	we get lost in most places
A	we got lost er where what was the worst one we got lost on?
B	well to me the the worst one was in Snowdonia
A	oh was it?
B	oh
A	oh
C	mm?
A	yeah we did didn't we?
B	supposed to be a famous little church way way in the wilds
A	we didn't take a map with us
C	no map? compass?
[ANNOTATION]	The church was built in 1950.	Neutral
A	we had a basic map
C	compass?
A	we got compasses yeah
C	mm
B	but erm
A	well we knew where we were we had to look for this for this wall
C	so what was this little
B	in fact
C	little church then?
B	in fact we could mm?
A	it was a church in the middle of nowhere
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Map and compasses are available for the exploration.	Entailment
A	we just came across
C	and what was special about it?
A	well we wanted to just go and have a look at it
B	well everyone said it's a wonderful little church go and see it
C	oh right okay was it?
B	yes it was
A	it was a rather nice little church but it was a church you know
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker C has not seen the little church yet.	Entailment
B	it was no different
A	it was a nice little church yeah
B	very tiny and very
A	and we got lost
B	yeah
A	and this fence we could see where we wanted to go
B	or you could climb over various walls
A	that was the awful thing
B	and walls you know over the foot
A	over the stile proper stiles
B	the stiles
[ANNOTATION]	The church was a very big one.	Contradiction
A	over the stiles landing on this
B	can't work it out
A	this this fenced
B	we could actually see the village
[ANNOTATION]	The villagers take care of the little church.	Neutral
A	and we got down to there and there's this huge fence stopping you going through anywhere else
B	yeah mm
A	so we come back get over the wall again walk a bit further
B	up by
A	we knew where we wanted to go
B	yeah that's the we
A	but we couldn't get there
B	it was awful so we said well we'll have to go we'll have to up and along and then down again didn't we?
[ANNOTATION]	It wasn't easy for the speakers to reach the church.	Entailment
A	yeah
B	and we did that I don't know how many times and
A	and the trouble is we had a youth hostel to go to after
B	it just got a nightmare
C	oh dear
B	and we were totally exhausted
A	we were
B	we we
C	and they were queued up waiting to get in
A	no not quite were they?
B	really hot well actually what what we did was we went all the way back to the church
A	painting
C	mm
B	like you know a a doing a painting of it right?
A	well well we knew it it were and he was staying at the youth hostel
B	and then and we reckon the rest of him he he'd
C	oh right
B	dumped his rucksack right?
C	yeah
B	and we put it safe
C	mm
B	and then and he'd come up to this little church
A	to paint the church
B	to do a painting of it
C	mm
B	and oh
A	and he give us a lift
B	oh it was like saved saved our lives didn't it really?
A	oh it was so far back by car
B	yeah
A	only just got we got
B	just one of those things isn't it?
A	we were
C	oh
A	it was nowhere near as far up see but we got we got back and there was no one waiting was there? so we were okay we
B	yeah
C	it's odd that you managed to walk there but you couldn't walk back
A	yeah
B	oh if we'd have come back the same way in the very beginning then it would have been alright but
A	oh right
B	we really thought you get further over well that's what we were gonna do in the end that's why we went back to the
C	yeah
B	we went back to the church
C	mm
B	to go back
C	yeah
B	but we'd have been
C	mm mm
B	we'd have been home but at the same time I it's the one time I wanted to sit down and not go anywhere else
A	yeah
B	I really did not want to move
A	we were knackered mm
B	any further I didn't care
B	I didn't care that we didn't get back I just didn't wanted to stop
A	yeah
B	it was horrible
A	that was horrible yeah
C	that
A	no
C	about the erm the story is that the prince
A	mm
C	his only son under the protection of his hunting dog
B	yeah
C	and there's his dog with blood all over his mouth
B	right
C	so he draws his sword and kills him
B	oh
C	and under the crib the baby was still intact
A	oh
B	oh
C	yeah and they they they say there are er it's a very old story
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	and erm they say that that that the dog you could in the language you can
A	yeah
C	that he killed rather than a dog but there is a there is a tombstone it's not the genuine one it's one they put there
B	yeah
C	saying this is the you know this is the burial place of
B	yeah
C	of Gelert the
B	faithful friend
C	the faithful dog yeah erm and you walk miles to that and miles back and you think god why did I go there?
C	that's why I said was the church any good you know?
B	well that's right
C	but it was fun walking but you know
A	going back though isn't it?
C	when you got there you thought
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	yeah you thought that
B	oh no I but
C	it so it's only there because it means the tea house up the end and they do a bit of business you know
B	mm
A	yeah yeah
C	ah fair enough
B	yeah
C	but it's one have you ever read any of those books?
B	no
C	you know there there's there's several erm
B	what's the name?
C	very old well
B	do you know the name?
C	no no oh no I
B	you don't oh
C	well Beddgelert is the story it is Beddgelert there's a
B	oh
C	there there's a town called Beddgelert you see
A	yeah
B	yeah that rings a bell now
C	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Beddgelert is close by.	Neutral
B	I think
C	erm well it's like when I say a town it's a little village whatever it's called erm
A	a hamlet little place
C	erm
B	gotta watch your money
C	but there are
[ANNOTATION]	The town is big.	Contradiction
B	there we go
C	I don't I don't know why that's er my money actually
B	we we bought all those here
C	oh
B	there you go
C	oh right erm
C	there's the white is it the white book and the red book? they got lovely stories in
A	yeah
C	but they're erm
A	I think I've I have heard of them but
C	there's a they're
A	various length
C	they're the sort of collection of
[ANNOTATION]	There are no white books.	Contradiction
A	mm
C	about in the old days
A	yeah
C	written a long long time ago
A	mm
C	cos it was always princes wasn't it?
A	yeah
C	erm and er she was married to an Irish lord to forge links with Ireland and er so Branwen went off to get married erm and he locked her in a tower and didn't care for her or anything and so Branwen learnt the language of the birds and told them what had happened and they flew back to her father Bran the prince of Wales and told him so he gathered up an army and the rest of the army went in boats but he waded across cos he was so big and tall
[ANNOTATION]	The story is based on a true story.	Neutral
C	and it may well have been that you could actually walk across
A	yeah yeah
C	in those days you see
A	yeah
C	across the marshland and slaughtered the Irish completely
[ANNOTATION]	The Irish were harmed in the story.	Entailment
A	well
C	as a punishment and they argue that that's one of the something like that did happen that's why the Irish population has always been so small
A	yeah
C	you know and they were decimated by the Welsh at one point
A	well
C	but there's lots of there there's lots and lots of stories like that
[ANNOTATION]	There is only one story.	Contradiction
A	there are various and yeah
C	the red book and the white book
A	and the
C	they're lovely stories
A	there's a story about that dog that er waits for his master to come home and he sits by the bus stop every day
C	there's one that sat by
A	is it
C	a gravestone
B	Greyfriars Bobby
A	Greyfriars Bobby
C	yeah Bobby that's right
A	yeah that's right
C	yeah erm that's up in York? Yorkshire isn't it?
B	I think so yeah
A	yeah
C	Bobby cos he he's buried in the same graveyard isn't he?
A	that's right yeah yeah
C	it's the only animal buried there
A	yeah mm
B	mm
A	there's some really moving stories like that about ain't there?
C	well to be honest
A	yeah?
C	but if I if I put a pullover down on the side
B	yeah
C	blow me that night she's slept on it it'll all covered in fur and everything
B	yeah
C	so anything if I put you know er and for instance like you see Friday I was working up the top and Thursday
B	mm
C	erm and you know come back ten o'clock she's come up and she's asleep next to me working
B	yeah ah
C	and sleeps there all day
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	you know
B	mm
C	and then if I go downstairs she comes down with me and then I go back up and then five minutes later she's back up
C	so they do do that kind of thing
B	mm
C	you know
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	strange though I wonder how they can you know
C	yeah yeah mm
A	it's obvious that they took a shine to you

B	sorting that file
A	pardon?
B	we can sort it out before then couldn't we? some
A	I don't know if I want a wood burner in there
B	mm?
A	that's a wooden house
C	should be alright if you put a stone hearth down
A	yeah
C	cast a hearth can't you just put it on the hearth?
A	yeah
C	put a fan there
A	yeah
B	mm
A	and then
C	yeah I can see I can see the yeah if you put a reasonable hearth stone down you know
A	yeah
C	should be alright
B	mm
C	it's very enclosed isn't it though you know? a burner like that it's not as if it's an open fire
A	no it's true
C	like that one
A	it's true yeah
B	mm
A	drill a hole in the roof
B	you wouldn't have too much burning at a time would you need
C	oh yeah you've gotta have a
B	have er yeah
A	you've gotta have a flue
C	but it's only a that's not that difficult
A	no
C	no
A	yeah I don't suppose that would be that difficult that it would mean moving a lot of stuff that I've put in there now
A	all my shelving
