A	you're lying I think you're lying to us
A	yeah definitely but no very peculiar
B	mm
A	yeah so apart from that our next door neighbour's fine like he is a bit weird and he doesn't really talk to us very much but
B	mm
A	yeah yeah no they're fine I wouldn't go and have like you know bonds and cups of tea with them and stuff but
B	no
A	as as neighbours go they're alright

A	yeah
B	no
A	as I am leaving
B	mm
A	and yeah
B	are you gonna miss living with
A	er
B	a little bit?
A	yeah of course I will like to begin with it wasn't as good as it is now cos she used to sit in her room all the time she never really used to come out she just used she used to be with
B	mm
A	and talk to him and so I never really saw her and she never made any effort
B	yeah
A	and it was like well that's fair enough but you've got to make some effort like she hasn't made really any friends since moving here
B	mm
A	and she doesn't join in with anything like she was gonna come to the netball and then she didn't go to the netball and stuff and
B	yeah
A	so it was a bit hard to begin with but then I spoke to her one night and I made I joke and I was like you know if you and
B	ah
A	and you know I thought she was gonna take it quite badly but actually she took it really well
B	mm
A	and she was like yeah that's true I don't wanna be stuck in a rut
B	yeah
A	so she started like er she like
B	yeah
A	erm she's met
B	yeah
A	she talks which is better
B	yeah
B	yeah it does that's
A	mm
B	I just don't have
A	do you wish you'd moved in with
B	well no that never really was an option
A	oh wasn't it?
B	no not really
A	yeah
B	which is fair enough so
A	really?
B	which is really nice yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	they get on as well like so that's nice
A	that is really good
B	yeah
A	what have you got on this week? what's what's going on?
B	er
B	er I like work choir
A	what days do have choir?
B	Thursdays
A	Thursdays
B	yeah and I think I might
A	oh it is Great British Bake Off final
B	so I might go round to
A	mm
B	on Wednesday going to try and go to the gym and do fifteen minutes of cycling
A	that's good
B	on Tuesday just to start it off
A	yeah
B	if anything it'll hit tomorrow so
A	yeah how long will it take you to get back to
B	three and a bit hours
A	from
B	yeah
A	shit
B	that's if the traffic's good
A	it is a Sunday afternoon so hopefully it should be okay
B	yeah I hope I'm not going straight I'm not going into
A	yeah
B	cut out some of it
A	do you go to
B	yeah I'm gonna go and get off at
A	oh yeah yeah yeah
B	or anywhere near that
A	yeah the
B	it'd take me about
A	yeah
B	from
A	yeah it's just easier to get off at
B	yeah I mean I know it's more expensive it's like four pounds for a single
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Person A think  that Person B like to stay in the traffic	Contradiction
B	to
A	saves time yeah
B	it's worth it in terms of like
A	that's annoying but
B	yeah
A	why are you sitting in the
[ANNOTATION]	Person A is sure about the thing that they did it was time saving	Entailment
B	trying to keep to a timetable
A	it's like I wanna go home I don't give a shit about your timetable
A	but
B	the worst I think the worst thing about the X5 is that they don't actually
A	oh do they not?
B	they don't stop at every stop
A	ah
B	so unless
A	unless you request it or
[ANNOTATION]	Person A do what think is right without waiting for Person's B request	Contradiction
B	you request it or at least you know where you're going
A	ah
B	kind of wanna be going from
A	mm
B	so
A	yeah cos er to go what does it? it goes from
B	mm
A	to
A	to
[ANNOTATION]	Person A know where does Person B want to go.	Contradiction
A	then
B	yeah I mean it's pretty good
A	yeah yeah it's a good bus it's an efficient bus it just takes a while doesn't it? but then it is
B	yeah
A	it is seventy miles but it's because it's single carriageway like this it'd be quicker
B	yeah
A	if it was double carriage dual carriageway
[ANNOTATION]	Person A believe that single carriageway must be quicker	Neutral
A	erm no I don't think it
B	yeah
A	it's great for getting up and down the country going across the country
A	it's non existent
B	so going into
A	yeah well no you can go straight up as well like
B	oh yeah
A	so it's
B	yeah
A	and
B	yeah that's good
A	that was really quick and really quite cheap cos I booked in advance
B	mm
A	it only cost me forty pounds return
B	that's really good
A	it was like twenty-four pounds one way and then fourteen pounds the other or something
B	that's very good
A	it was really cheap I I was
B	yeah I got a thirteen pound fifty single to
A	mm
A	it's so oh I love it I love a good old cheap train ticket
A	but then you look like an hour later and it goes up to like fifty quid you're like what?
B	yeah exactly just the fluctuation
A	yeah
B	between it you just can't
A	but no
B	yeah
A	it goes to
B	that's good
A	it's really good and like you can just
B	yeah
A	like I still wouldn't probably choose sometimes yeah it's it's it's good
B	oh no
A	but
B	oh do they?
A	yeah
B	that's a bit random but
A	I know
B	you'd think it'd be the other way round
A	yeah but
B	yeah
A	there isn't an
B	yeah
A	but
B	I wouldn't like the season ticket prices
A	no I think the season ticket prices are horrendous aren't they?
B	yeah
A	it's like thousands of pounds
B	mm
A	just to get to work
A	but are you when you start looking for new jobs do you think you're gonna look in
B	yeah I'll just erm I'll just look in different places part of me is wondering whether to go back north for a bit but I don't know
A	do you think?
B	I just miss home
A	yeah
A	mm
B	I just wanna be somewhere a little bit more accessible to home
A	yeah
B	maybe you know not
A	yeah
B	on the train because the trains are rubbish
A	yeah
A	how far is it from
A	oh still an effort isn't it?
B	but it's two hours to
B	from
A	that's so weird
B	it's cos of the speed of the train lines like you can get
A	oh I see yeah
B	to
A	it's just
A	ah
B	but it's the kind of thing where it's like at least that's better than five and a half hours nearly six
A	is there any publishing houses up north or?
B	no
A	you wouldn't look for publishing? you'd move industry?
B	apart from
A	yeah
B	so
A	yeah you'd change industry
B	that I'd go into
A	or education I guess you could go into education
B	yeah I suppose so it's
A	mm
B	experience of teaching
A	would you like to go into teaching?
B	no
A	no
B	I mean I I'd
A	yeah
B	late hours you know
A	and kids kids are just horrible they rip you apart like they find a weakness and they just like
B	prey on it
A	yeah prey on you it's horrible I wouldn't wanna be teacher if they if you paid me which they obviously would pay me but
B	yeah
A	it'd have to be
B	but not enough
A	a bloody decent salary to do it yeah
A	like I barely know how to survive as an adult in an in an adult working life as it is how can I teach seventeen year olds to
B	yeah
A	I know I am an adult just er
B	yeah but it's about how you feel in yourself and some people are like yeah I'm gonna stand in front of the class and
A	Romeo Romeo wherefore art thou Romeo?
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	to the deny thy father refuse thy name thou wilt not be but sworn my love I'll no longer be a Capulet
A	yes I know Romeo and Juliet leave me alone
B	I'm not saying anything I've got a Romeo and Juliet print on in my room
B	mm
A	that is sad that's even sadder than me reciting it no I'm kidding it's really not
B	don't know about you but
A	yeah but as I say do you think you might have a look in just other industries as well as publishing or?
B	yeah I'll just I I just need to have a look at what's around
A	what's out in the world
B	yeah pretty much
A	dunno why I did the jazz hand movement there
A	jazz hands
B	oh god

A	and like and like I said to you all weekend I don't understand why Americans portray English people as such fucking wankers
A	because we're not
B	yeah
A	they just take enthusiasm to a whole new level of like
A	weirdness
B	it's amazing that's awesome
A	it's like absolutely positively the most amazing thing I have ever seen in my
A	and you're like oh my god
