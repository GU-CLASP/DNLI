B	and then I went to university after that
C	where did you go?
C	oh yeah
B	mining engineering
C	oh great
B	so er oh well I know my way around
C	yes
B	underground training at
C	yeah yeah
B	erm and then went to
C	yeah
B	down to
C	yeah
C	yeah
C	yeah I was teaching in
B	were you?
C	so that was really interesting there was
B	mm
C	the
B	right
C	and I was teaching in
B	oh yeah
C	and and sixty percent of the kids were from miners' families
B	and it still divided communities
C	yes
B	even now thirty years down the track
C	yeah well it it just wrecked it
B	yeah
C	in my opinion it just wrecked it
B	mm
C	it just er shocking really
B	but
C	mm
B	closed at once but I mean I was in the mining industry erm but in the metal mining I didn't
C	oh right have you worked abroad then?
B	er only for a short period but erm I went to university as a
C	oh right right right
B	so I did a bit in Holland drilling holes and then joined erm
C	mm
C	oh yeah
B	but I was with
C	yeah
B	er and
C	it's massive isn't it
B	yeah
C	it is one of the biggest is it the biggest coal mine?
B	it was erm
C	no
B	and in fact they were very there were very few er
C	mm
B	and then got transferred down to
C	oh right
B	and initially they put me down there for twelve months and then I was going back in
C	oh right
B	twenty years and then I got moved erm to
C	the what?
B	cathodic protection
C	what's that?
B	stop stuff going rusty
C	oh right
B	you know pipes in the ground go rusty
C	oh yeah
B	so you've gotta galvanise
C	yeah
B	them or put cathodic protection on them
C	right
B	so we did all the
C	right
B	on the oil rigs in the North Sea
C	yeah
B	and then I did that for
C	oh right
B	and that's how I ended up at
C	oh I see
B	because I came back from Saudi on a
C	so how long were you in Saudi for?
B	oh only one only two days a month
C	oh right
B	so I was based in
C	yeah but going out that was quite nice really
B	have
C	isn't it rather than being stuck in Saudi
B	oh yeah I don't want to be stuck in Saudi
C	no because it does get
B	you know
C	it does get hot doesn't it?
B	it does get hot
C	I've never been but I I worked with somebody whose husband was out there and he was trying to
B	oh right
C	and this is this is for the Saudis and and he described how just getting from the car to a building
B	yeah
C	you had to kind of run or have an umbrella
B	mm
C	I've I've lived in hot places so I know what it can be like but nothing like
B	well I've been
C	fifty-six degrees
B	yeah I've been in
C	that's too hot for me
B	and you've landed and you come out the the airport terminal and it is fifty-one
C	ooh awful I couldn't do that
B	it is like walking into a brick wall
C	yeah yeah it would be
A	so what about
B	erm we lived in
C	oh I've been on trams I saw the last tram
B	yeah
C	we went down to watch it
B	what number were that? 535 was it?
C	I've no idea
B	ah
C	I don't know I was only about five or six at the time mum and dad took us down to see the last tram but I remember I've got vivid memories of the trams because by that age we'd moved up to erm
B	right
C	very close to the school
B	yeah
C	and we lived we used to be able to well I grew up listening to the kids on the playing fields because the sound would carry
B	right
C	and also I I I I grew up to the thwack of the erm
B	yeah
C	you must have been there?
B	yeah
C	yeah well from my bedroom window I could see down
B	oh right
C	onto your playing field and I could see everybody in white
B	right
C	and you could hear the shouts when people got wickets and but you could actually hear the thwack on the bat
B	right
C	if it was still you know
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	oh yeah
C	that field now is all overgrown because my friend lives
B	is it?
C	not backs onto it and it's all overgrown
B	oh yeah we
C	now it's got horses on it now
B	has it?
C	it's not it's not a playing field any more
B	oh because we had the football pitches there
C	yes
B	and a lovely cricket pitch
C	yeah
B	and then of course we had the other pitches up at
C	oh yeah
B	we went there that's right
C	yes that house is up for sale at the moment
B	mm
C	a massive place it's up for sale the house
B	oh right
C	yeah
B	but erm
C	that's right when I go home that's my friend lives there near just where the playing field was and I walk by the river there
B	yeah
C	with the dog
B	yeah oh right
C	yeah
B	because I there was a guard who used for me in
C	oh yeah
B	next to
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about party	Contradiction
C	oh really
B	yeah he's a
C	oh oh right
B	ah
C	yeah
B	small world innit?
C	yeah
B	but yeah I spend many hours at
C	mm
B	but I mean it was bandit country around
C	yeah
B	and
C	yeah the
B	and now it's even worse
C	and do you remember when they built the flats
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	person C is not sure when they built the flats	Neutral
C	and how that was
B	yeah
C	because they thought it was going to solve all the social problems and it just made it worse
[ANNOTATION]	they are not sure about solve social problem	Entailment
B	that's right
C	and all the stories of the people dropping off and stuff being dropped
B	oh yeah oh yeah
C	yeah
B	yeah I can remember before
C	yeah
B	and along
C	yeah
B	lot down there
C	yeah
B	no the
C	or was it
B	no the
C	oh the
B	then you went passed
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about a way	Neutral
C	yeah
B	and then a bit further up was the
[ANNOTATION]	person B is talking about further	Entailment
C	yeah
B	and that was real bandit country there
C	yeah the
C	the
B	did you?
C	he got a girl into trouble as they used to say
B	mm
C	and it was all you know dreadful and awful and she was older than him and it was shocking and she was Irish and it was all wrong and all they could afford was a house on the and I remember my mum going with a bag full of clothes for them and I could tell she was in a bad mood and she was going to see
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about school	Contradiction
C	and coming away
B	so where did you go to after
B	and doing what in Jamaica?
C	teaching
B	oh right
C	but it didn't feel like I was teaching there
C	erm but it was interesting the first year I was there I went on a two year contract and I taught in
B	yeah yeah
C	because we were under curfews it was the erm nineteen seventy-five six elections and it was er curfews at certain times in the day and my school was in the middle of the
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b is looking for new experiences	Neutral
B	mm
C	and we used to I lived behind burglar bars for two years there were burglar bars on the school and we were locked in
C	and let out you know it was er er
C	and Mr
C	I'll never forget that absolutely brilliant and the PE bloke there we took the kids on a trip to erm a little island called I think it was no what was it?
C	I sat on that arm
C	and she sat on that and he picked us up and it's amazing the photograph but yes it was an experience and the second year I was there I taught at erm the
B	yeah
C	and that was a different experience altogether
B	yeah so why did you then decide to come back?
C	well my contract ran out and I got what I call islanditus I'd met everybody and done everything and been right round the island and and you get
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b wants to travel to the caribbean	Neutral
B	mm
C	you know it it the police weren't friendly like our
B	no
C	police and things and erm er a lot of
B	yeah
C	just growing in everybody's garden it's not
B	yeah it's not
C	starvation poverty it's not like Africa
B	no mm
C	so erm the the it it was you know a kind of liveable poverty
B	mm
C	it wasn't you know but it was around and so erm I remember talking to a chap and they'd introduced television on the island only in about nineteen sixty-two some some quite recent
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b comes from Africa	Neutral
B	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Jamaica is a very rich country	Contradiction
C	and they they imported all the American cop shows and he said that you know if if there was a Cagney and Lacey type thing on a Monday there was copycat crimes
B	mm
C	all over the island people doing exactly
C	what they'd seen on the telly you know and
B	yeah that's right
C	I would go back but I would only go back I wouldn't go back with anybody who had never been I would go back with my friend
B	mm
C	and have her there because we kind of we understood it then and we can kind of see how it is now
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	speaker c had a friend in Jamaica	Entailment
C	and we
B	mm so you came back to the UK then?
C	yeah
B	when and where?
C	back to
B	did you?
C	yeah I went to live erm my my dad had got a residential teaching erm headship and erm
B	where was that?
[ANNOTATION]	speaker c came back from Jamaica	Entailment
B	oh right
C	back up
B	yeah I know it
C	behind
B	yeah I know it
C	near
B	yeah
C	very near
B	yeah
C	and erm so they left their house so I stayed in the house while they had a flat because it was residential
B	oh right
C	they had to be there and erm I got
B	yeah
C	and I went there and it turned out a bloke my dad trained with was the head so I was there for a term it was and then the teacher came it was somebody who was just off sick so I was a term there and then I went for a term at another middle school and then I went in to a term at
B	right
C	and that was erm obviously with all the mining kids
B	and that's
C	just before the miners' strike
B	yeah that's when you got caught up with the miners' strike
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	the eighty-odd miners' strike
C	yeah and
C	the nineteen ninety-four
C	I remember I went see my friend in
B	mm
C	and what they did in the miners' strike they bussed them up from London so they weren't
B	that's right
C	yeah and I was coming home from
B	mm
C	and I got there was some carry on during whatever and they were looking for flying pickets I think
B	yeah that's right
C	so they stopped me and I wound down my window and I went hello and they were so nasty they're so nasty the policemen because they were from down they were from London
B	yeah that's right
C	and they weren't appreciating me going hello
C	like you would
B	mm
C	because that's what you did and they were so foul
B	mm
C	yeah
B	oh eh there was a lot of nastiness going on in
C	yeah yeah and the government were behind erm
B	your husband is what?
C	he's reading a book all about the miners' strike and what happened behind the scenes and all these papers that had been released and it it tells you exactly
B	mm
C	how the Thatcher government and the powers that be erm set a lot of people up and gave them a lot of bad publicity it is all there
B	oh yeah
C	you know it is all true
B	oh that's right
C	which is a sham really
B	well we got tangled up in it down at the smelting works
C	right
B	because of course we erm
C	yeah
B	er and if you are using a lot of coke you need a lot of coal and we were up on a quarter of million tons of coal a year and you weren't allowed to import it
C	mm
B	erm and in fact it was
C	yeah
B	or we are going to shut the place down erm as simple as that because we just couldn't compete
C	no
B	so we were allowed to import coal
C	oh
B	erm and we paid
C	oh yeah
B	and they brought it up on the train into
C	yeah
B	er and then in the miners' strike the train drivers refused to drive our trains so we got a haulage contractor to and we ended up erm
C	yeah
B	with the miners' pickets so the haulier er and this is where the downfall of the NUM started and our names are on the high court writ erm that the haulier took them took the NUM to court
C	oh I see
B	and that's where the sequestration of the assets started
C	oh I see
B	so oh gawd blimey we had a we had a right do with the miners down there and we had the flying pickets down from
C	and that was before mobile phones imagine what it would have been like if we'd got mobile phones
C	as well yeah
B	but what went on in the
C	mm yeah
B	but it was ironic because that he I trained at
C	oh
B	down here at
C	yeah
B	that was the first time I basically it is the nearest I got to understanding
C	she had a what
B	a pony
B	she was so privileged upbringing the only pony I ever had were at
B	yeah that's right
C	and when we used to go and visit her because she lived actually it is the
C	and she had a house there and she used to see the pit ponies that was an amazing landscape because I think there was a bit of open cast mining there as well
B	yeah there was
C	and it was all rose bay willow herb
B	yeah that's right
C	and it was all
B	that's right
C	and the bypass wasn't there it was just all fields
B	that's right
C	and you could just now and again hear like a hammer in the steel works
B	aye
C	you know like everything would look
B	yeah that's right
C	really quiet and still
B	yeah
C	and then suddenly you would hear a great big crash and it was coming from
B	yeah oh yeah there was quite a bit of open cast then
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	my mum worked for the
B	did she where at?
C	yeah she she she was in the offices and she worked at
B	right
C	she did the admin for open cast mining and she got free coal because she worked for the
B	well at first
C	mm
B	although it's
C	mm
B	yeah huh god and my father worked in the steel works at
C	yeah
B	he was er he worked he worked there from the time we went to
C	mm
B	but he was coming we'd
C	oh
B	which was er
C	no
B	but mm but you say your mother and
C	mm
B	so he left school at thirteen
C	yeah
B	and then spent most of his life being pretty frustrated because
C	well my mum left school at thirteen because it was the law and at
B	mm
C	and so she never went back
B	mm
C	which is a shame
B	but yeah me going to
B	no he went to
B	yeah I think you will find he went to
C	oh I thought it was
B	I will check it when I get home
C	yeah
B	but of course the the year that I was there erm was quite incredible the
C	mm
B	erm professor of astrophysics and all this sort of thing well blimey there were some real bright cookies there I mean I was well down the pecking order going there
C	so how did? how did you? were you able to keep up? I mean were you okay there?
B	I wasn't to start with
C	a bit of a shock?
B	well because in terms of erm
C	no
B	was not quite what it was at
C	no
C	yeah
B	so I didn't know what they were on about when
C	yeah yeah
B	I went into latin classes it is alright for you English teacher but I didn't understand what the subject was and an object and a past participle
C	didn't you?
B	no so latin I struggled
C	mm
B	no so I couldn't cope with that but on the science side of course I was
A	was that when you went to secondary school from primary
B	yeah
C	you are talking about?
B	my first two years in grammar school
A	but didn't you start latin from the first year of secondary school?
B	yeah and I did it for two years and then dropped it
A	why? because the others did they have a head start on you?
B	well because they understood about English grammar
A	why? because
B	well because they had been taught it in primary school whereas at at
C	but at
B	that's right
C	hearing sentences which weren't grammatically correct
B	that's right
C	all the time constantly
B	yeah absolutely
C	weren't you
B	yeah
C	and I think that one of the main barriers
B	yeah
C	that that that would be a problem
B	that's right
C	yeah
B	and the only thing that carried me through was because er when it came to the sciences and then came to sport of course I was way in front of
C	yeah because you didn't
B	I were way in front of most of them
C	yeah
B	at
C	yeah
B	but on on the art side and the English
C	yeah yeah
B	oh god oh dear
C	I was with my cousin
B	oh erm
C	er it begins with
C	no no not
C	near
B	mm
C	and he asked two lads
C	yeah I am sure they are bright but they don't speak grammatically correctly
B	no that's right
C	because they haven't been brought
B	no that's right
C	with people who do
B	that's right
C	and and you know their playmates are all speaking
B	yeah that's right
C	that you know
B	and I had the same problem
C	yeah
B	when I went to
C	yeah
B	but what carried me through was because of my maths and my sciences and the sport
C	yeah
B	erm but on the art side cor blimey
C	mm
B	I was nowhere
C	yeah
B	but erm
C	yeah
B	and I didn't have the confidence I didn't think I would pass so I didn't bother applying for university
C	oh excellent
B	so er
C	to
B	yeah so I got my three maths A levels and my physics and my chemistry
C	good
B	and that was that was it and then off I went to
C	so would you be in favour of bringing grammar schools back?
B	I would yes for the simple reason that if they hadn't been there I would have been stuck at
C	exactly and that's what I feel as well
B	yeah
C	because if they hadn't been there my parents wouldn't have
B	no that's right
C	really have you know
B	so I'm all
C	fulfilled their potential I mean my mother never did because hers was cut short
B	yeah
C	my dad probably did but she didn't
B	no
C	and erm
B	so yeah I would be all in favour of it because I
C	yeah
B	I see what it gave me otherwise I would have been stuck
C	yeah
B	erm with
C	and not only that I think that my husband and a friend of mine erm
B	yeah well that's right
C	in in amongst everybody else
B	yeah that's right
C	and erm it it must have happened time and time again
B	yeah that's right
C	but they both admit to to failing to stay in the class with their mates
A	what deliberately?
C	deliberately
B	yeah that's right
A	where did they do that?
C	why?
B	right
C	you know a really rough area and he ended up he ended up on Piper Alpha deciding whether to drill or not whether it was safe at the height of the oil boom
B	mm
C	fortunately before it blew up
B	before it blew up
C	yeah but er
B	but yeah I I know erm
C	yeah where would you be?
B	if if I hadn't got out of that
C	and
B	and gone to a grammar school
C	there's a fabulous programme I've seen it twice I think and Michael Portillo went to that grammar school and Edwina Curry went to the grammar school
B	that's right
C	and then they interviewed loads of other people and they all said you know they went into this world and it was like coming from terraced houses into this palatial place and they were able to really fulfil their potential
B	that's right
C	and I think that's what we've got lost in the
B	that's right I am certain of it
C	comprehensive system because if you are in a comprehensive system and you are a bright person you can choose which
B	that's right
C	where where your performance level
B	that's right
C	is going to be to stay with your mates
B	yeah that's right
C	and I bet that's happened time and time again
B	I bet it does yeah that's right
C	well I mean
B	well I was very lucky with my two kids because they they went to a comprehensive school the other side of
C	yeah yeah
B	er and
C	yeah yeah
B	down at
C	mm
B	and it was a toss-up whether she went to vet school or whether she went to school of music
C	mm
B	because she does piano and violin
C	mm
B	and everything and he said you've got a real gem here but you've got to push her along so we did
C	mm so you've got to think how many people like your dad who was obviously a clever bloke
B	yeah
C	have just been completely
B	that's right
C	just just just they've all they've all they haven't had those opportunities
B	that's right
C	have they?
B	and and if you don't we've always thought that if you don't
C	no and what's more they will find satisfaction and possibly not in the right way
B	yeah that's right
C	I mean you meet a lot of bright in prison don't you?
A	mm
B	oh aye
C	yeah
B	so yeah give me a grammar school every time
C	I know
B	because look what it's done to me
C	yeah exactly and what it did for my parents
B	mm
C	and you know if I had gone let's say I had gone to a comp I would have been the first to have been thinking I am staying in the third lot there because that's where my mates
B	that's right
C	I would have done that I can see myself doing it
B	yeah I would
C	hiding my light under a bushel because I I went to school I went to grammar school and I got in the top form I don't know how because I was I was always the class clown and I was always drawing attention I would do anything for a laugh anything
B	yeah
C	and and I suppose I was just lucky really because if if
[ANNOTATION]	Person C think he was just really lucky	Neutral
B	mm
C	you know you you can decide to move yourself out can't you
B	that's right well I never got in the top stream at er at
A	twenty-one
B	twenty-one
C	oh it's a fantastic it's got the most fantastic reputation if you went to
B	it hasn't now though it hasn't now
C	no well it is a comp isn't it
B	when I
C	they've wrecked it
B	yeah when I was there
C	yeah
B	it was number six in the country after Eton
C	yeah
B	Harrow Winchester
[ANNOTATION]	Person B said that number six in the country is  Harrow Winchester	Entailment
C	yeah it's fantastic
[ANNOTATION]	Person C think it is fantastic	Entailment
B	and Manchester grammar
C	a fantastic school
B	oh yeah
C	oh my dad went to
B	did he?
C	because my nan
B	yeah
C	or when the war started my nan decided to and she had relatives or at least a friend over in
B	mm
C	which was quite good but no
B	yeah it was number six in the country
[ANNOTATION]	Person B think it was very good and it was number six	Neutral
C	but when I
B	when I were there
C	when I lived on my road because we had a little
B	yes
C	and two doors down I met him recently at a funeral actually
B	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Person B is going to dance	Contradiction
C	like that but at
B	mm
C	the the academic prowess of those lads and he was bumbling along in the bottom line
B	yeah
C	I think
B	no I had one mate at
C	yeah
B	he couldn't
A	but did you have problems socially?
B	what at
A	yeah
B	no not erm
A	because you couldn't have
C	did you meet
A	with friends
B	no
C	did you invite lads home to your house?
B	no because nobody lived anywhere
C	no
B	lived anywhere near us
C	but I was like that because
B	yeah yeah
C	and they all lived in the
B	no that's right
C	not not from school
B	I was the same
C	yeah
B	because there was nobody around
C	no
B	that you know at
A	so who were you friends with at the weekend?
B	erm well I used to play quite a lot
