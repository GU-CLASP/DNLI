A	when you were in the village?

A	yeah
B	it's how far he takes it and
A	yeah
B	you're gonna say no

B	well I dunno
A	mm
B	and so she is probably very sensitive about that sort of thing
A	yeah
B	got together at my house party she said he was all over her like a rash
A	yeah
B	and I think that's why she left
A	but
A	yeah
B	like he doesn't know when to stop

A	cool
B	she's going out on the
A	I mean that's alright but you've gotta share
B	tenth?
A	like with it's like three bedrooms in the apartment
B	mm
A	so you get like randoms coming and going
B	well I suppose that's quite nice
A	well that is true
B	yeah
A	it's a nice place
B	she said it's it's quite it looks quite nice
A	yeah
B	which is quite nice
A	I've had that room
B	Cos she's yeah she's going on the tenth for two and a half months
A	oh
B	I know
A	put your feet up
B	well
A	mm
B	any opportunity because I have to cover her work along with a couple of other people in the department
A	yeah
B	it just does mean that like if one person is able to go on secondment then other people could
A	yeah
B	like realistically
A	yeah
B	um
A	yeah
B	she looks really stoked
A	yeah
B	she booked herself in on the Monday
A	so what's
B	and by the Friday it was sorted
A	so what's he gonna do like
B	look after the dog
A	ah
B	well cos um Julie was saying Andy often works away himself so
A	yeah
B	and he'd go out at some point or
A	yeah
B	or fly out that weekend to her
A	yeah
B	or something
A	how exciting
B	it's really exciting
A	it's really nice
B	just so jealous
A	I must go back
B	yeah
A	get myself back there
B	yeah
A	so
B	well it does go to show that um it's possible
A	yeah
A	yeah
A	I'm not really
B	hoi polloi will
B	in title
B	yeah
A	oh
B	yeah cos I thought oh well that's it then
A	yeah
B	and Sophie's like oh don't worry like I think you're probably set now
A	argh
B	shit man
A	oh she's on the other end of an e-mail though
B	mm
A	still be picking up her e-mail
A	like you know
B	not entirely
A	no you can still e-mail her and call her and stuff
B	I suppose I just think like if you had an emergency though that person is right there
A	yeah
B	and I know I could turn to anybody else in the department
A	well you've just all you need to do is just make a note of your problems and then the ones that you solve fine the ones that you can't solve just ring her
B	mm
A	the time difference isn't that bad
B	yeah that's true
A	yeah
B	really
A	up to three o'clock's normally when like
B	mm
A	so normally ring at three
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	probably be in the office at nine
A	yeah
B	at the latest so
A	mm
B	she'll probably be the only one
A	oh yeah
B	like most people do
A	yeah
B	mm
A	in like New York City city
B	in the nice bits
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	it's just off Central Park sort of thing
B	amazing
A	oh
B	yeah
A	yeah it was
B	and to Czech Republic this year
A	yes
B	so that's pretty good
A	so that's quite soon
A	twenty-first
B	oh okay
A	oh no
B	oh okay
A	no
B	more like three weeks? Four weeks?
A	mm
B	um some amount of weeks
A	four weeks
B	yeah
A	that'll be nice
B	yep
A	czech beer
B	czech beer
A	mm
B	is Mike gonna fly out?
A	I don't think so
B	mm
A	we'll see
B	I booked my London accommodation today
A	yeah?
B	yeah
A	it won't be
B	but then I'm sure it won't be
A	it'll be like two weeks' time we'll be like oh God
B	yeah
A	oh yeah
B	Cos like did I tell you I've said no to all the hen parties? Yeah
A	Wise move
B	I think I might that might be my plan now
A	just say no to
B	from here on
A	like anyone's hen
B	yeah cos I've never been to one and I think if I start
A	Don't
B	it'll be a slippery slope
A	Don't set any precedents
B	I know
A	just say I don't do hen nights sorry
B	I think that's fine
A	I think if it was something that you could
B	mm
A	if it was here
B	yeah
A	you could just go to easily I think yeah fine go
B	yes
A	New York or whatever
B	you have to fly
A	yeah
B	I think if it costs any more I mean a hundred pounds has gotta be the limit
A	yeah
B	hasn't it
A	yeah yeah
B	if it costs more than a hundred pounds no
A	mm
B	Cos that's just ridiculous
A	mm
B	Cos even Sophie's hen party in Brighton
A	yeah
B	then you've got
A	it's ridiculous
B	what you're doing in the evening
A	I never get that
B	yeah
A	and let's go partying
B	yeah
A	and let's have our hair done like
B	well in my head when I was younger I always used to think I'm not gonna cos I grew up in Brighton I'm not gonna have a hen weekend like that
A	yeah
B	I'll go on holiday
A	yeah
B	I'm like that's a fucking ridiculous idea because it'll cost everyone three hundred and fifty pounds
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	you've got like
B	or you're going with your best mate or something
A	yeah
B	twelve people
A	into coming because you've decided to get married
B	oh it's all about me this week girls
A	yeah
B	everything
A	I
B	yeah
A	that's why I never have a birthday party or anything cos I hate that like it's all about me sort of thing
B	it's hard isn't it
A	I just really sort of I understand why and I know it's nice to celebrate and that
B	mm
A	and I'd get too stressed about it
B	yeah
A	people you know it's people feel obliged to come and if they don't come you're er there's loads of politics isn't there
B	it is difficult
A	yeah
B	because it sort of makes your friends come to you
A	yeah
B	or I find in my case you're the one
A	yeah
B	going into all the different groups of people
A	yeah
B	it's quite nice to get everybody together in one place
A	yeah
B	and to guilt trip them into doing so because it's your birthday
A	you're evil
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	not to make people pay loads of money
A	yeah
B	or like the wedding
A	I think if you want people to come
B	aspect
A	you've gotta make it something reasonable
B	yeah
A	oh
B	like that's still gonna be sixty even if
A	yeah
B	per night
A	can you silk one's really nice
B	which one?
A	the one that you wore on your birthday
B	the green one?
A	yeah
B	yeah it is nice
A	that's really nice
B	yeah and I
A	I think you could wear that easily
B	do you think?
A	just you know you can maybe get a little jacket or something for it and
B	yeah
A	some jewellery
B	fascinator
A	I think so
B	yeah that's good
A	Weddingy
B	and it's quite spring-like
A	it is
B	because green with white flowers
A	job's a good 'un
B	yeah
A	you're welcome
B	aw
A	welcome
B	I'll get you to knock me up a dress
A	er yeah
A	er
B	because of the weather?
A	Cos I can't be anused
A	just don't fancy it
B	oh
A	I do like I like knitting obviously
B	yeah
A	um but I think sort of like cos
B	yeah
A	and if she wants to knit in a pub oh that's that's good cos I like pubs
B	yeah
A	um but like she's like really wants some new people to come and all the time and I just find it a bit draining like
B	yeah
A	I'm not desperate to make like make new friends or anything
B	mm
A	whatever
B	mm
A	like I'm not really desperate to have

B	right
A	and I really liked it
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A is thrilled with the scarf.	Entailment

B	I remember making bobbles at school
A	yeah
B	circle
A	circles
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	mm
A	um like with a hole in the middle
B	mm
A	put them two together and then you wrap the wool round and round and round and round and round and round
B	mm
A	and then you cut them
B	and you can pull them off
A	tie a string through the middle
B	oh okay
A	and then you pull them off and you fluff your bobble
B	oh
A	so I've made these massive bobbles
A	I've made three of them
B	you're gonna put three of them on?
A	I don't know
B	you could put two er one on each end and then like make a hat and
A	I know
B	five bobbles on each end
