A	related to
B	related to poppies as in like remembrance
A	yeah
B	so I think the money goes to
A	yeah yeah
B	mm
A	Help for Heroes
B	erm
A	mm
B	to start running although saying that I did think right I should go tonight as well and I was like oh I just
A	I'm really bad
B	it's dark and it's cold and it's wet and I just think I did my time
A	I did my time
B	I did
A	no
B	even half and hour's now you'd think you'd be like oh yeah half an hour that's fine I can do that but no I just don't wanna do anymore
A	yeah
B	mm
A	it's horrible
B	mm
A	unhealthy or you've gotta have
B	yeah
A	an incentive
B	well that's what that's it that's why I thought if I sign up to this then that might give me a little bit of incentive
A	yeah
B	erm
A	yeah
B	but it think I wanna start doing different stuff really I still miss spinning I should just bite the bullet and
A	get the gym membership
B	yeah but
B	erm
A	but now you're supporting your man
A	I'd be I'd be definitely up for that
B	yeah
A	it's like you were saying the other day I think
B	I think there's a lot to be said about like cos I haven't really ran at all since I moved in with you and think it's I dunno I think it's just that I don't wanna go out on my own
A	yeah
B	in front of the telly
A	yeah
B	cos I when I was in
A	you'd go with
A	mm
B	I'd just be more likely to go for a run whereas cos you're always you're here when I get in
A	yeah
B	I just wanna sit and have a chat and have a cup of tea and then by the time I've done all that I've completely lost any motivation to go out or
A	yeah
B	go for a run and when you're settled down like settled in and it's nice and warm and you just don't wanna go out again do you?
A	no
B	I mean I really enjoyed it on Sunday so
A	I
B	as I'm running I'm like you should do this more often it would get easier and you would start to enjoy it again
A	it would it
B	yeah it does I just I can't seem to carry that forward
A	no er
B	mm I mean it
B	wasn't off putting it was a nice day
A	yeah
B	so hopefully we can do that soon that'll be fun
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	but
B	the only thing is you've gotta get in the
A	yeah
B	build it into your routine
A	I think I'll end up doing the inevitable like
B	that's good
A	it's such a clich√© though isn't it like?
B	not really
A	yeah
B	enjoy it it won't last long
A	mm
B	mm
A	what just
B	I was moaning about him er and then pulled pork on a pizza
A	pulled pork on a pizza?
B	yeah
A	pulled pork
B	there pulled pork everywhere
A	everything pulled pork everything
A	tea
B	oh you reckon you can get like pulled pork teabags?
A	give it time
A	as I say the ones that make me laugh are like pulled pork crisps
B	yeah
A	it's like I mean do ever crisps ever taste like I dunno they just taste like
B	it's just barbeque isn't it?
A	it's yes yeah
B	barbeque
A	but
B	flavoured crisps
A	do you know there's like
B	yeah oh god I haven't had Lilt for ages do they still make that?
A	I I think so but the isn't that the the the thinking behind that is because
B	yeah
A	certain colours tell our brain certain things
B	if they're a certain yeah
A	so this is like years of studies have done this since like
B	yeah yeah
A	it's and it's kind of what they call a synaesthesia
B	yeah
A	a colour a colour can't taste refreshing but
B	yellows and
A	there's associations based on
B	yeah
A	maybe it's based on nature
B	yellows and greens
A	yellows and greens isn't it that kind of
B	yeah
A	whereas like
B	it's like they've made the
A	why is red hot?
B	Coke green now haven't they?
A	right and what's the
B	which is erm
A	what's the gimmick?
B	it's it's natural
A	oh piss
B	like
A	off
B	natural sugar or something
A	natural sugar?
B	yeah
A	isn't that bad for you as well?
B	well it's still sugar isn't it?
A	sugar is sugar
B	or natural sweetener maybe I was watching one of those
B	Horizony programmes though
A	get off
B	about it and their thing was yeah this is the you know they were saying at first this can't be much better for you than normal sugar and then they did loads of research into it and they found out that
A	uhu
B	actually are real things like it is a plant that grows that
A	well we
B	they can
A	we watched it with that woman
B	yeah
A	when she travelled to it was on
B	yeah
A	it was on Food Unwrapped
B	like Brazil
A	it was
B	yeah that's what it was
A	yeah
B	cos they were like well is it just refined fake chemically stuff that they're putting in? but it was actually it is actually natural
A	a natural sweetener
B	yeah
A	er oh
B	I've never seen anything
A	tobacco's natural you don't chew it do you?
B	well some people do
A	yeah exactly it's just
A	some people
A	erm what was I gonna say? yeah but
A	so I I always think like I just think if you put on a bag of crisps
B	mm
A	so like there'd be like a kind of a degree of like chicken rennet or whatever they put in it like
B	oh
A	whatever they put
B	yeah
A	whatever they make the chicken flavouring out of
B	oh
A	or beef
B	yeah I don't like to think
A	or
B	of it
A	prawn cocktail but I just think
B	prawn cocktail's
A	but I just think if
B	like paprika really
A	you
B	isn't it?
A	put a kind of meaty kind of taste on something
B	mm
A	colour the bag
B	yeah
A	oh prawn cocktail like ah yes it tastes like prawn
B	mm yes
A	is it chicken?
B	mm they do taste weird
A	it's not chicken though
B	I used to like chicken
A	yeah
B	haven't had them for a while
A	I mean I dunno the I think salt and vinegar's fair but you know the way it's like green? like why do
B	no it's green in Walkers but everywhere else it's blue
A	mm
B	although saying that the Aldi version are now green
A	what's barbeque?
B	black
A	black? like
B	chargrilled
A	chargrilled
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	oh it's brown oh this is this is bacon
B	what's it what's the purple one? Worcester sauce?
A	Worcester sauce in our in our set it's Worcester sauce
B	yeah
A	that just makes sense
B	why is that purple?
A	dunno it tastes like purple
A	when when
B	or does it taste like purple cos it's in a purple bag?
A	I dunno
A	blowing my mind man
[ANNOTATION]	The bag is red.	Entailment
A	why
A	when we were in erm the curry house the other week in
B	yeah
A	it doesn't but everyone everyone just agreed it should taste red it should be red
B	it should have been like was it tomato sauce or something?
A	no it wasn't tomatoey it just er no one could quite understand or like a purple like a dark purple it was sweet and very strange but it just didn't green is kind of like a natural
B	it didn't taste natural?
A	no it didn't taste like anything that was growing it tasted very much like something with a lot of sugar and a lot of
B	yeah
A	sweetener and a lot of spice in it
B	oh
A	it was dead strange but everyone was just like passing it around like
[ANNOTATION]	The bag is red.	Contradiction
B	yeah
A	what
B	what colour would that be?
A	yeah
B	that's interesting unless they like blindfolded people
A	when?
B	like to taste they like do a blindfold taste and say like what colour food do you think that is?
A	did we organise a blindfold?
B	no not we but did they?
A	who?
B	whoever did that research
A	in the curry house?
B	oh did you say you?
A	yes
B	oh okay I thought you said like something you'd read
A	no
B	oh okay
A	rather strange setting
B	it's like
A	for a clinical research
A	yeah
B	I can understand that
A	I guess so
B	oh
A	I can
B	I can't
A	I've just kind of I dunno
B	mm
A	I shouldn't do but
B	it's inevitable though isn't it?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	mm
B	you never would have spent loads anyway
A	yeah it's all paid for I mean I don't have to like spend loads of money when I'm there so
B	uhu
A	it's not so much of a problem
B	I'm looking forward to Friday as well
A	will
B	uhu
A	but it's at her parent's house?
B	yeah
A	have they moved?
B	no
A	still live in

B	double whammy god don't let me forget to take those presents will you?
A	just leave them out somewhere so we can
B	yeah I know I put them in the office but I don't ever go in there
A	don't put them in the office
B	I know they'll get spiders in them
A	no they won't
A	one I think one of the ones from the hall's living behind the TV now
B	how do you know it's the same one?
A	it responded to its name
A	he came he came when I called it
A	I've got this like callus on my finger
B	oh let's see
A	I can feel it? I don't know what it's from though
B	just feels like a bit of dry skin
A	it might be a burn but I
B	oh
A	dunno I'm always burning my hand
B	it feels like when you play you know when you play guitar and the ends of your fingers get a bit tough?
A	my fingers are actually growing back that's how long it's been since I've played guitar like that that's not the hard skin anymore
B	mm
A	have to
B	have to build it back up again
A	redevelop my calluses
B	yeah
B	running guitar
A	got a joke for you
B	go on
A	what do you call a freelancer without a girlfriend?
A	homeless
B	oh
A	oh
B	it's funny cos it's true
A	yeah
A	oh
B	mm
A	I dunno I'm not I'm not
B	nervous excited?
A	no
B	mm
A	like I know in the end it's a it's good thing but or it will be a good thing cos it always is but I'm just erm
B	mm
A	possible jobs and there ain't much about
B	well
A	but then I I don't really have much faith in like you know when you know when you go on like a website and it's like
B	yeah
A	we top we stop taking on after a hundred applications
B	mm
A	you realise it's that reminder I guess it's that reminder of what what you're
B	what you're up against
A	what you're up against sometimes
B	yeah
A	erm
B	same with us
A	but I guess the thing and and I'm so basing on my experience of like being you know looking for work before but things are so different now
B	yeah I think things are different and your experience is different and you're in a better
A	uhu
B	not like we're fresh faced graduates anymore
A	but that's kind of scarier because
B	no it's not
A	no
B	it'll be good
A	so what are you basing Thursday on? why why have given Thursday as your estimate?
B	erm because they said they say on the website that erm
A	okay
B	and do not contact the university before the sixteenth
A	yeah but then don't but don't read it too much into it if you don't get a
B	yeah but then there's things like erm
A	so do you think your tutor would you she get in touch with you if she'd been contacted?
B	I would have to get in contact I think it's my responsibility to get references
A	so so what? they will contact you and say
B	provide references yeah contact your references and get them to
A	have you spoken
B	put them in
A	have you spoken to that woman who you normally speak to?
B	erm
A	tutor
B	tutor erm I haven't told her about that one I've got
A	well hadn't you better? you'd better give her a heads up
B	yeah well I will do if I get a thing
A	do you think she'd be like ready to do it like?
B	yeah she'd just copy and paste what she's written for my doctorate ones probably and then I'm gonna get my old boss to write one and I told her ages ago and she was like yes yes of course I would of course I would erm
A	okay
B	and she'd write a good one
A	so you're not worried about getting hold of a reference?
B	no I just need two references the only reason I was so panicky about that other reference is because
A	right
B	on your reference whereas in this case I'll have already been shortlisted
A	so you you're taking out one stage of said process?
B	uhu
A	how do
B	if you have
A	yeah
B	or anything I mean I'm for seventeen places what would you say? about sixty people?
A	yeah
B	sixty out of two hundred so that's
A	yeah
B	one in three and a half
A	I know but like
B	I've got such a lot of experience in that area I think
A	I know but then that's the horrible thing isn't it? if I mean
B	yeah
A	I just couldn't I couldn't understand how I mean like you
B	yeah to not even be shortlisted
A	you can be so confident
B	mm
A	you can be so confident at that at that stage when you're submitting an application for something and
A	and then and then when it doesn't happen you sort of you sort of post-rationalise things and and and sort of say oh well you know fair enough maybe I could have done this and maybe I could have done that but you'd end up driving yourself insane
B	mm
A	that's why I think it was on the front of the Independent today there was erm
A	and it was like employment levels at pre
B	pre-recession highs
A	pre-recession highs but that's such a misleading
B	yeah
A	erm
B	yeah but by job they can mean a two-hour contract or a no-hours you know like what are they called? no-hour contracts
A	zero-hour
B	zero-hour contracts
A	zero-hour contract
B	you know that counts as being in employment
A	a no nonsense contract
A	that's what I want
B	I mean that person might have been in a permanent full time job before and now they're on a zero-hours contract
A	yeah
B	but that will still on in figures come out as the same won't it?
A	mm
B	or people I mean really what's happened is people are doing more hours for less money aren't they? so like like my mum now has to work
A	but that was part of the restructure wasn't it?
B	mm
A	me? are you talking to me?
B	no
B	that's the erm that's the thing though isn't it like? like they've you know those NHS strikes?
A	yeah oh that was today
B	yesterday
A	those were yesterday were
B	it was yesterday yeah
A	how did they go?
B	erm I saw a few picket lines when I was and all outside our work
A	were you not expected to partake?
B	I'm not in a union so
A	can you join a union?
B	I can but I'll have to pay
A	pesky unions
B	can't afford to pay
[ANNOTATION]	union membership is subsidized	Neutral
B	erm but it's like
B	it's stupid like so the the they were protesting it because NHS staff haven't had a
A	a pay rise
B	didn't get a one percent pay rise along with the rest of the country erm and haven't had a pay rise for years but they the government just came out yesterday and said oh yeah we can give you the one percent pay rise if you want but we'll have to make job cuts
[ANNOTATION]	the union is demanding more jobs	Neutral
A	what would you prefer?
B	yeah exactly it's like well this is blackmail really isn't it?
A	but then that creates inflating then doesn't it because you've got people who are you know will feel somewhat indispensable and will be like well I haven't had my pay rise
B	yeah
A	so
B	it's just that put up and shut up attitude isn't it?
A	put up or shut up
B	well yeah
A	it should be put up or shut up
B	no it's put up with it and put up with what you've got and shut up put up and shut up
[ANNOTATION]	the policy is welcomed	Contradiction
A	no it's put up or shut up because if you don't
B	no
A	put up with it then
B	it's put up and shut up
A	it's put up or shut up
B	but that doesn't make sense
A	it does it says it's basically saying
B	because if you're putting up with something
A	I'm too tired I'm too tired
B	then you are just shutting up
A	to explain
B	aren't you?
A	I'm too tired what it means is
[ANNOTATION]	the union is very supportive	Neutral
B	you're not arguing with it if you're shutting up if you're putting up with it
A	it means it means if you don't put up with it
A	you can shut up
A	you can all shut up
B	but
A	put up or shut up it's or it's not and
[ANNOTATION]	the workers will remain quiet	Neutral
A	put up with it and shut up
B	well that's the NHS mantra
A	right
B	put up and shut up
A	put up and I think it says that on like when you go to the
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	NHS expected worker to be content	Entailment
A	if you go to the hospitals
B	it does
A	in a
A	in that kind of in that kind of beautiful typeface that kind of
B	yeah
A	green squiggly typeface
A	put
B	put up and shut up
A	put up and shut up
B	mm
A	so that was so that was that was the conclusion yesterday was
B	yeah
A	shut up?
B	exactly well
A	mm
B	put
A	mm
B	it's what he should have said really
A	yeah
B	so
A	no
B	but
A	were any
B	everyone
A	what was that?
B	anybody in Unite or Unison
A	that's fair enough I was thinking about I was
B	there was a lot of nurses and midwives
A	I was thinking about
B	maternity pay? I've no idea
A	no no I mean like maternity were like
B	oh maternity services
A	the
B	yeah the erm
A	the biggest representation
B	the women's there was a big picket line of er midwives
A	mm
B	outside the women I don't know about
A	I suppose that's her closest isn't it?
B	yeah I think so
A	but it's due this week
B	unless it's
A	what was my bed?
B	can't remember
A	twenty
A	twenty-eight isn't it?
B	or
A	I think mine's the twenty-eighth
B	was it? you might be looking good then I think towards the end of next week
A	what do I win?
B	nothing just the pride
A	the child so I win the
B	yeah
A	congratulations
B	first first hold of the baby
A	oh I win I win godparent
A	me and

A	last year was pretty bad
B	yeah
A	that was that was the

B	last year
B	I was looking for a photo to show my mum of you as Alan Partridge but I couldn't find one

A	it's not
B	you just cos you can't decide on anything
A	I can I'll think of something
B	yeah you will
A	something good
B	but I've decided that's what I'm doing

B	it's not distasteful cos you're not going as like a dead Robin Williams you're going as a tribute to his
A	listen here chief
A	I'd like to go as Good Will Hunting rather than the others
A	my hope is
B	he stole my line
A	yeah
B	cos it would be distasteful if you weren't
A	maybe I maybe I will go as Good Will Hunting Robin Williams just cos I wanna wear like a tweed blazer and
A	do you think many people have seen that film?
B	yeah
A	of our friends?
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	you've never seen Dead Poets Society have you?

B	everyone
A	everyone
B	I don't think everyone is
A	they're gonna exploit
B	go as Mrs Doubtfire
A	they'll go Bicentennial Man
A	or the genie from Aladdin

A	no
B	okay don't go as the genie
A	people will think I've gone as Tobias from Arrested Development
A	yeah yeah okay that's that's a start
B	yeah I think that's good cos that's not distasteful cos you're not like
A	a nice thing yeah
A	and maybe it I suppose it'll be quite cheap to put together as well go to a charity shop and buy I can always like like like a really raggedy cardigan
B	haven't you got one that you can like rag around a bit?
A	no my dad never wore that kind of stuff
B	you've got you've got a cord blazer I'm sure
A	yeah that's smart
B	yeah but couldn't you wear it?
A	no it's got to be dusty and crappy
B	oh
A	no they're not
B	no? okay
A	there's like
B	look on the one on Bond Street
A	there's like there's a I mean Harris tweed is like I think that I think that was like a good brand of blazer many years ago but there's there's one of them and it's it's in a charity shop it's been there for about a year
B	really?
A	and it's like fifteen quid it's quite big though but it doesn't matter
B	it's still a lot of money
A	that's nothing
B	Halloween
A	it is now
A	can you think of any
B	er what like round the house?
A	no
A	really?
B	I'll pay you pocket money
A	there was I remember the time when I went I went around to my nan's once
B	she gave you fiver
A	fifteen
A	and it was just
B	yeah
A	like I just couldn't get a job and
B	any money was
A	any money
B	well
A	just just to go
B	received
A	just to go to the pub and
B	yeah it's a lot of money is
A	I was gonna go round there anyway
B	yeah
A	but like you know I should have done it for free really
B	perhaps
A	it was it was not an easy job it wasn't it wasn't like a little bit of pottering about and tidying
B	yeah
A	cos it wasn't tidying it was cleaning and like you know things like a dish tray that hadn't been cleaned since like
B	oh god
A	eighty-two?
B	time began
A	yeah since she bought it
A	erm
B	gross
A	and just loads of stuff like that and like all the bathrooms and everything like that
B	oh bless you
B	but then
B	yeah I suppose
A	it all balanced out in the end
A	I think she
A	does your nan give you money?
B	here's your inheritance now
A	that's what my nan used to say
B	yeah
A	can't take it can't take it with me
B	can't take it with me I'd rather we enjoy now while I'm here I'd rather see you enjoying it

B	full of food she she never goes in there she never even opens the
A	I don't wanna marry I don't wanna marry into your family
A	all the men
B	why?
A	all the men seem like
B	downtrodden?
A	henpecked is that the word?
A	is that the word?
B	it just reminds me of Fargo that now
A	hey
A	your dad's not
B	do you think?
B	alright then
A	well he's quiet anyway I think he's naturally quiet
B	yeah I think he is
A	he's learned
B	he has to be
A	no one listens
A	that's why that's why like I was really made up when he made that joke
B	which joke?
A	when he said about this woman's grassed them up cos I was like I bet you sit on these all the time
A	I bet you sit
B	and he just chuckles to himself
A	I bet you sit and listen to people's conversations
A	and think that would be really funny if I said that
A	and he just keeps them to himself
A	that's why he doesn't speak
A	and he
B	conversation going on in his head
A	he's secretly the funniest man in the world
B	yeah very funny
A	always make me laugh
B	yeah
B	I haven't been watching it and I don't know what's going on
A	I think Winston's gone for a job interview
B	mm
A	why do you hate her Zooey Deschanel?
B	I just hate her I don't hate Zooey
A	why?
B	oh cos it's just boring
A	and why's that?
B	just don't
A	no she didn't
B	she did
A	no she didn't
B	didn't she?
A	she no don't think she
B	did she not produce this?
A	no
B	oh okay then
A	no
B	really?
A	yeah it's like
B	why? it's awful
A	like
B	what do you like about it?
A	me?
B	yeah
A	I like any kind of soft American sitcom
A	what's the one that's on at the moment in the day? there's this one and it's oh it's awful and it's called Melissa and Joey and it's you know Melissa Joan Hart?
A	oh don't get excited it is
B	oh is it rubbish?
A	it's
B	I love her so much
A	woeful it's
B	has she gone terrible?
A	it's woefully bad and
B	what does she look like then?
A	like Melissa
B	does she still look like
A	like Melissa Joan Hart
B	oh
A	unsurprisingly she's put on a bit of weight but I think she was quite skinny when she was young wasn't she? so
B	yeah well she wasn't very old when she did like
A	it's kind of like
B	Clarissa and stuff
A	one of the inevitabilities of being older but
A	she erm
B	what when you just get random people to like
A	what's that
B	donate?
A	what's the website called? it's called something like
B	Justgiving?
A	no Justgiving's like a charity
A	no it whatever it is basically
A	so you say to people I need one thousand pounds to buy ceramics and to buy a kiln and to get my business off the ground upon doing so I can give you this back so they kind of people offer different things back some will offer like a free a free copy of the product or a free thing from the product
B	mm
A	and if people invest like a minimum investment of like a fiver
B	mm
A	erm so it's about
B	oh
B	yeah I suppose it is isn't it?
A	so it's called crowd pulling the idea is that like people some people just like the idea of something so they yeah I'll give a fiver for that hope hopefully it'll come good
B	mm
A	erm
B	yeah
A	there's probably there's there is there is like er they've very
A	it I don't even think it's regulations I just think it's a very good system I think
B	oh
A	it's very difficult to screw people over on it or something like that
B	yeah
A	or people
A	erm
B	it's a Game Boy game isn't it or something?
A	it's a Game Boy game
B	so
A	no they said not real game footage
B	oh
A	this looks
B	oh
A	I think
B	time
A	is that a game? oh my
B	I know
A	god
B	oh but that's
B	why do people wanna play these things?
A	to
B	I don't understand
A	to expel demons in them
B	well you know the next thing will be like
A	have you
B	but I just think like when is it gonna stop? like what cos that's almost like playing
A	it is actually
B	like how awful
A	yeah but the idea is that is that you're surviving the evil you're not carrying out the evil
B	mm okay
A	I mean there was Call of Duty where you had to torture someone and that's pretty
B	yeah
A	pretty brutal
B	I always used to find myself like
A	but Call of
B	don't let your
A	Call of Duty is but Call
B	seven-year-old play Call of Duty
A	it just reflects the kind of the time we're in like
B	mm
A	Call of Duty originally I think I
B	yeah
A	and then it just took on this whole other level eventually where it was like very I think as as the visuals improved
B	yeah
A	it just
B	it looks real I think
A	yeah it just
B	that's the thing now isn't it? they look more real
A	and I guess the
B	it's scary
A	on on the PS one and and
B	mm
A	but the blood was like big circles that came on it
B	yeah
A	and it
B	yeah
A	I remember like Grand Theft Auto originally was a top down bird's-eye view and okay you ran over little little like you know stick people almost
B	yeah
A	and blood would squirt across the road
A	but it looked so cartoony and silly
B	yeah
A	that like you know a parent might be worried about what was happening but
B	mm
A	in real life you don't see things from a
B	and I don't even mean it from like er oh those children are gonna go out and kill people but it's just like
A	but it's er more immersive that's that's the problem isn't it? like
B	yeah
A	computer games are more immersive than film in film it's easier to kind of sit and say I'm I'm this is a a product whereas when we're doing the
B	I know but those those visuals are still having an
A	but er
B	effect on you aren't they?
A	but I think when you're doing it when you're engaging with it more that's worse because like you kind of
B	well it is worse really
A	the boundaries kind of between
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	they blur
A	and so on but I mean I don't know what was my original point?
B	dunno I don't know I think I interrupted you
A	it was Melissa Joan Hart but erm
A	but just what you're saying about that game there I mean that is
B	it's horrible
A	you know to shock and to kind of you know
B	yeah
A	to scare people and things like that but
B	oh that looks like a nice pie
A	but these these things aren't mindless though these games I mean like
B	mm
A	erm but there wasn't a single like it was just using your noodle and it was like a lot of story and a lot of
B	mm
A	background and stuff
B	yeah
A	and and people were like ha ha no way Melissa Joan Hart's trying to get money to to start a TV show
B	yeah
A	erm and it's called Melissa and Joey and it's just about her living with a guy that
B	mm
A	she's not with but
B	mm
A	couldn't carry on
B	with hilarious consequences
A	but it's it's really bad
B	oh that's a shame
A	well no it's not I mean
B	yeah like fifteen years ago
A	fifteen years ago people change
B	she wasn't really that great in it it's just that Sabrina the Teenage Witch was like my favouritest programme of all time ever
A	it well I
B	I still secretly hope that one day
A	is that
B	I'll wake up and be a witch
A	I was watching this and I was I was thinking how rusty like
A	but I was thinking like how
B	mm
A	so and I guess when you're a kid you don't really you're not very discerning about
A	I just don't think you like this kind of TV
B	no
A	the
B	she annoys me cos she's just like oh I'm a ditsy doctor
A	but
B	it's like I don't like Ugly Betty either
A	that's
B	and like
A	that's
B	that and I group that in
A	that's finished
B	in the same
A	category
B	yeah
A	well I suppose if you look at this and New Girl like it's
B	I know
A	I'm just a mess I'm just a
B	I know
A	I can't hold my career together
B	yeah
A	all the pressures of being a
B	I think that's what
A	modern woman
A	but at the same time the whole er the kind of the success of these programmes is that you know it's like it's like you know look at I dunno New Girl and it's like she's ridiculously beautiful and can't keep a
B	mm
A	that's the kind of
B	yeah yeah I dunno
A	that's why Girls is a bit of a better programme isn't it? cos the the at least the
B	yeah they're kind of
A	the
B	more
A	together
B	normal no they're not together at all
A	the yeah but er they're not ditsy are they?
B	no
A	relatable
B	yeah
A	what Girls?
B	no these sorts of programmes
A	well they have to be self-contained don't they?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	it's cleverly it wasn't cleverly written it was well written
A	it's coming back isn't it? it's gonna keep going for a bit
B	yeah I mean I haven't seen any of the last series
A	but I
A	I just have this on and I don't I don't
B	you like the bright colours and the
A	I I just
B	the stimulus
A	I just need I don't need a TV I just need a box that lights up different colours
A	sporadically
A	and has
A	sort of very accessible humour just coming out of it like
B	yeah
A	but if you're here then who's in there? oh no that's why I need it just to say
A	who are you and what have done with that just those kind of jokes all day
B	okay
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a lives in france	Neutral
A	I'd be happy
A	it's like Friends that's why I like having Friends on
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about humour and tv	Entailment
B	yeah
A	I don't have to watch it
B	mm
A	just to know someone somewhere laughed at some point is all
A	just to hear
B	what I like about Friends though is that you can put it on and you can literally watch the first two minutes and
A	mm
B	in your head you've like flashed through the whole episode and remembered all the jokes laughed at all the jokes and then you watch the rest of the episode and laugh at them as they come up
A	yeah
B	no it's not you just need to watch the first like minute to like jog your memory of what happens in that episode and then it's like oh yeah that was really good
A	yeah
B	erm I used to like Sister Sister Clarissa Knows it All
A	Sister Sister was good wasn't it?
B	yeah Tia and Tamera
A	Tia and Tamera
B	erm what else were my favourites? I used to like The Flintstones and The Jetsons

A	yes
B	I never liked that really
A	what's to get?
B	I dunno I really I always thought I should like it cos everyone else liked it but when I tried to watch it I just
A	I think I think I used to like Saved by the Bell because it didn't it it was on before school but it didn't come on until nine in the morning so I knew if I was watching Saved by the Bell I'd managed to
A	probably get off school
A	it was on er honestly it was on it was on like

B	over food
A	once I'd turned about fifteen I didn't I just didn't eat breakfast just just didn't like it
B	I never fight and it's always food over sleep
A	er now I've I've kind of got to the point where I'm it's like I'm appreciate it a bit more but
B	I mean I don't really cope very well without either but
A	no
A	cos we stayed cos we stayed up watching Newsnight last night

B	don't tell me anything cos I don't even like knowing that there's a secret to it
A	was that a nominee
B	I
A	or is that the winner?
B	it was a nominee because I was looking at it today on the website erm at what else was nominated
A	uhu
B	so there's five books that are erm shortlisted
A	mm
B	but it says that the winner is gonna be announced today or maybe is the Man Booker is that an American thing?
A	no it's British
B	is it? oh they haven't announced it it's not on the internet who won though
A	oh they this it wasn't like this yeah the first year they've allowed American authors?
B	oh is it?
A	yeah
B	no
A	and he said a
B	a furore
A	furore
B	so just as erm Man Booker Prize for fiction shortlist is revealed
A	maybe not all the judges have finished it it's like oh god
B	yeah hurry
A	I wonder when the one for non-fiction is
B	I just find that weird why wouldn't they have announced it today if it says it's gonna be announced? so it's How to be Both by Ali Smith J oh it's gone
A	it's gone?
B	no no I've just clicked something that's all
A	that that's the one
B	The Lives of Others it's not the film that's the one that's tipped to win according to the internet
A	mm
B	oh that one of that book last night she's American
A	yeah
B	there's two Americans and Aussie and two Brits
A	well I hope that one I hope
B	that one we watched last night?
A	it sounds like a cracker
B	oh right the one that
A	yeah
B	it's erm it's set in India
A	cos they do the one for non-fiction as well don't they?
B	do they?
A	yeah
B	of whatsit?
A	Middlesex
B	yeah
A	yeah it's brilliant but I don't really want to wanna finish it I'm at the point where you know when you're coming to the end of a massive book?
B	yeah and you don't you feel like there's gonna be a void when you
A	you kind of through all the the
B	I
A	it's such an epic book
B	yeah
A	you through like
B	mm
A	in the story so you sort of feel a bit like
B	mm
A	but
B	yeah
A	it's it's when it's when like Cal is like younger that's when it's really really entertaining
B	oh here you go it's just been announced Richard Flanagan The Narrow Road to the Deep North
A	mm
B	what was that?
A	is there prize money for the Man Booker?
B	erm I don't know
A	you're not reading either of them until you've finished Catcher in the Rye
B	oh
A	it I just think er if you if you did give it like a couple of hours you you'd
B	yeah I know
A	I I think
B	that's it and it's
A	I think it's a book it's a book that you need to kind of read it and read though
B	and do it all in one go
A	don't don't read it like two pages at a time or something like that
B	yeah
A	cos you're never gonna get into it the good thing about like Holden Caulfield is like
B	yeah
A	about people and and that if you read it in a big chunk it's funnier because you're kind of you're seeing like how he
B	you see how yeah
A	how he just goes through cycles of people like he love people and he hates people
B	mm
A	and he feels then he feels sorry for people and that's how he deals with everyone like everyone he meets he either
B	oh
A	what?
B	sounds interesting you might like this
A	mm
B	I know yeah
A	buying any more books
B	oh yeah well there's an idea what happened to the library?
A	can't buy any more books
B	well I wanna go the library let's go to the library
B	and then I'm gonna go to the library I haven't been to the new erm central library you know since it's been done up
