D	hold on the the story's going way too fast
C	oh sorry

A	it's a long one
D	this er well yeah no yeah no it'll be over in five minutes but like
C	you you had to wrap yourself in the scarf
D	no so we walked past
B	what? you left the girls naked and you wrapped yourself in the scarf?
C	no I was dressed
D	I was like girls let's just sit here and like
C	I don't remember what happened to
D	basically see what happens
D	and then anyway so we walked past the caravans where there was like a football team and like they weren't outside they were inside and they I'd
B	and you were wrapped in a scarf?
D	noticed them on the way and so I'm pretty sure I'm like I'm pretty sure they
C	no I went and talked to them didn't I?
D	yeah
C	yeah
D	cos you were wearing the clothes
C	before the police came
D	and you were like you were like guys
A	she's wearing

C	like really rough
C	just like laughing
D	so there was this new hotel on this like otherwise really nice beachfront or whatever we went in there and they're like er
C	these silk silk pyjamas
D	and I got I got this I got these like
C	what are we gonna do without any clothes?
C	yeah

B	the silk PJs?
D	yeah yeah and like I'm pretty sure it was like a rugby top or something it was like a rugby top and like silk bottoms
C	yeah
D	and then
D	you've ever met and they were like are you sure you lost it? and we're like yes we like we went for a swim and we left it and he's like
D	have you checked the beach? and we were like yeah yeah we of course we have erm so they went around with a torch for a bit in the dunes and like
D	didn't find anything
D	and then they were just like so we were we're on bikes and it's like two miles back to the house
D	going in like odd clothes like cycling and they were driving at like two miles an hour
C	one of the other funny funny parts was when I called the police station the woman was like ah sure no problem now I'll send the lads down
C	and I was
D	they were like sixty
C	sixty-year-old dudes
C	like when they turned up
C	they were like you're joking now? you you're er you're er you're pulling our legs
D	yeah
C	we literally don't have any
D	yeah

D	all of our wallets were gone cos the the point of the story is we got back they let er we couldn't get in
C	no yeah
D	they helped break in
D	they broke into that house
C	so they
D	and then we got up
B	lolz
D	in the morning and it was like I was like quite a heavy smoker at the time and was like I had no cigarettes and no money
C	oh god

D	no she didn't she wouldn't give any credit
C	no
D	and then we had to cycle no shit ten miles
C	yeah we
D	to the to the next town took half the fucking day to get there
D	then
C	I went went around
C	asking for cigarettes off people

B	she wouldn't do it?
C	to to finish the story so our passports were taken which was
D	yeah but you

A	you have a watch? you can talk to

C	yeah or just really boring I guess it's not you don't buy it for the jokes though you don't read it for the jokes
A	you don't really buy
C	no no but there is er there is like a quality and importance in recipes that you would probably never cook but you would still read like that's still really valid
D	yeah yeah it's like getting your understanding of
[ANNOTATION]	they are jewish	Neutral
C	yeah and also it's good if if you're interested in like where recipes come from and the like history and development of certain styles and ways of cooking then it's really
