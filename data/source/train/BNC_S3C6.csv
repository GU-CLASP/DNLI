A	yeah and then delivering stuff out as well and it's
C	yeah
A	it's not just the not just the actual doing is it?
C	no it's not not just the actual being there it's the running around as well
A	mm
C	erm so I feel really really good erm
A	you do look refreshed actually
C	I I feel it
A	yeah
C	I feel it and and although I could
A	yeah
C	I wasn't mentally tired either but then I did go to bed with the intention of reading
A	ah
C	and I didn't even pick my book up I just got in bed and that was it it was just you you when you switch when I switch off I just go
A	mm
C	very often
A	mm
C	so no I I do feel good and I got my first event again next Saturday so that'll be the start of it all over again but
A	yeah yeah
C	maybe I don't know two or three a month
A	yeah yeah
C	for a while
A	so it's not so bad then
C	yeah yeah
A	mm
C	and I'm knitting like crazy
A	I saw that with your erm cosy
C	the tea cosies and things
A	bits
C	cos I I started off just doing tea cosy and then doing cuddly blankets and then
A	yeah
C	erm I'm speaking to the trading standards to get my toys CE marked
A	mm
C	they need to be tested we'll be selling them as toys
A	yeah
C	erm so er yeah had two orders of sent one off for America
A	mm
C	and I've had another one come in even before the other one had been sent there was another one coming in from America
A	yeah
C	and apparently it's quite difficult to get hold of tea cosies out there because they don't drink pots of tea
A	right yeah no that's it they drink all ice tea don't they?
C	yeah
A	I know somebody I was chatting to with the Words with Friends I was chatting
C	yeah
A	and they were saying something about yeah we drink cos I said something about right I've got to go I've got to make tea
C	yeah
A	and they're like oh we don't drink a lot of tea out here well we do ice tea and I'm like no I meant food and they were like oh supper? I'm like yeah okay
A	but I love that cos you just all the different little bits and
C	yeah I've got one friend erm on Facebook I I've never met her but erm I I met her through I got to know her through Words with Friends
A	mm
C	and she's I think she's about sixty mid-sixties
A	mm
C	and she's so lovely every time you post a photograph or any post that I put she likes it and if it's a photograph she'll she'll like all of them
A	yeah
C	you know when you go on holiday and you've got a hundred pictures
A	ah yeah she goes and looks at it all
C	and she'll comment on things and she'll put things like wow or what's this? or where's that?
A	yeah yeah
C	er she's so sweet cos I'll I'll put I I just put a just you know write anything
A	mm
C	and she'll say here I am your dumb American friend again I don't know what that means or I didn't know what that is and then I I do a little bit of research and I'll find another way of saying it for her or a bit of a an Americanism for her
A	yeah
C	and she goes oh now I understand thank you very much
A	yeah
C	and I love not only how our dialects change and and terms change
A	mm yeah
C	within the UK
A	yeah
C	but when you're it it really makes you think when you're trying to put it in something somebody from another country would understand
A	that's right you're explaining what it actually means rather than just thinking another way of saying it is like well actually how do I actually get
C	yeah
A	and and the total essence of what you're saying as well
C	exactly
A	isn't it? rather than just the gist of it
C	exactly like you said about doing tea need to go and do tea
A	yes yeah
C	it's a whole different a whole different meaning tea then
A	yeah I said to one somebody I said something about oh you can go off people you know cos they they were just start beating me and I was like oh and the they were laughing cos they were beating me and I said you can go off people you know and they came back and sort of said I can go off people I'm like are you are you twisting the words or are you not understanding? and they went I don't know what you mean by that so I was like right well what you say is you know somebody says something in a joking way that could be taken as mean you then say that back to them in a joking way as in you can go off people and and like I expect you to spread yeah
C	stop liking them
A	yeah I expect you to spread it right across America
C	yeah
A	and they're like right will do will do yeah yeah and I also had somebody when I told said I was going to give somebody a bollocking on there as well
A	they didn't get it I just
C	yeah yeah no no
A	no I said they're adults I'm going to give them a bollocking if they're not nice to me and I'm like yeah okay okay I spread the word yeah funny
C	got to reintroduce English to the Americans
A	yeah exactly exactly I've had one some some of them cos I play a lot of Americans I think when I was when I was off particularly cos of the time difference and stuff
C	yeah
A	erm I got playing a lot of Americans and and one of them sort of saying what to the what do the Brits think of the
C	yeah we're not all Mary Poppins
A	no exactly exactly and I I sort of said well you know I think a lot of Brits or you know cos it's funny cos you they you always say that I'm a Brit but actually to me I'm English I'm not British I'm English
C	yeah
A	all that and I I was saying like you were talking about that and I was I would say the UK but I would say I'm English
C	mm
A	erm and sort of said well you know I think a lot of English people think the Americans are quite brash and loud I said but then we're aware that it's such a huge area and so many different people and you know and that sort of stuff and
C	so it's almost like saying what do the the English think of Europeans
A	yeah exactly exactly yeah
C	and you do get stereotyped and and you also get the people that are in the headlines mostly so you often base your opinion on people that are making the news and sometimes it's because they're doing bad things and they're
A	yeah yeah exactly
C	behaving in a way that gives you a misconception of of the rest of a a culture or a or a country
A	mm mm yeah one one
C	well this is the thing a in a in American supermarket not long ago was it a two year old?
A	yeah yeah pulled it out the bag and shot his mum
C	shot his mother
A	I know it's just yeah exactly and that's what he sort of said you know he's got I don't I think it was like a ten eight and a four year old and he just said there's there's no way I'd ever risk having it in the house because someway something could happen to us or to them
C	yeah yeah exactly
A	you know and one of them
C	but I think what what what we are not aware of in this country is how much the gun culture is growing here and you can't I I every morning I scan through the BBC news website
A	yeah
C	and you get the world news and I I look at the England news and then I look at the local news and in almost every you know category there's either stabbings or shootings
A	yeah oh yeah yeah
C	and it's I think we're you get a bit numb to it don't you?
A	yeah
C	and and you don't it doesn't register that shock that it should do
A	no it doesn't no
C	because you're constantly reading you're seeing it all the time
A	yeah yeah well I remember well goodness I don't know how old I was I was probably I don't know if I was either a teenager or I was in my twenties because it was somebody who was a few years either older or younger but but
C	yeah
A	somebody when I was living in
C	yeah
A	now people are
C	yeah
A	we've got access now twenty-four hour news and things are put out everywhere and anywhere and everyone's talking about it so I think you're more aware of things that are happening
C	I know I do sometimes just scan over headlines and and I'll stop myself and I think why hasn't that shocked me? why haven't I been horrified at reading that?
A	yeah yeah mm
C	there was one thing yesterday that absolutely horrified me erm and it was a a the the headline was just baby found burning in road
A	oh right
C	an an American girl had had had it was a newborn baby she'd dowsed it in some erm accelerant and set it alight and dumped the poor baby in the road and it was still alive when they found it
A	oh god
C	and that was that was horrific
A	mm
C	because it was a a newborn baby
A	mm
C	and you've been in the situation where you've had babies yourself and and you think oh I could never do that but you know there's there's obviously a reason she's maybe very very unwell but if it had been an adult and there's been
A	yeah
C	there's been several occasions and you just think oh it's happened again yeah
A	oh dear that's a shame yeah
C	yeah that's it oh that's another one and it doesn't have the same shock behind it
A	not impact no exactly no no
C	no no
A	no no you're right
C	it's just the world we live in I suppose I sound like my
A	sounds like yeah
C	talking of grandmother and generations I was talking to my dad this morning about something that I think you might be interested in
A	yeah
C	you might already have seen it Peterborough train station in during the First World War
A	mm
C	was a hub for er serviceman travelling the country
A	yeah
C	and they had a er a tea room at the train station
A	mm
C	and they have visitor's books there so the serviceman were all writing little comments some of them were a bit some of them were a bit erm how did it word it? some of them were a bit er a bit fresh and fruity about the girls serving the tea cos some of these lads haven't been in the proximity of a woman for quite some time
A	yeah yeah
C	but Peterborough erm museum erm is wanting to get them transcribed so they can put them on the website
A	mm right
C	so that cos they know that you know the guys all put the date and put their little comments and they want to start publishing them exactly a hundred years to the day
A	okay
C	when they were written
A	yeah
C	and it was fascinating enough as it was but they're looking for volunteers to to do the transcribing
A	right yeah
C	and I I told my dad cos I know it's the sort of thing he'd be really really keen to get involved in erm and he'd already seen it but I didn't know whether it might be something that you would be if if not get involved in it then just follow yeah
A	is it do you have to actually you know go go there to actually do it or do they get stuff out or?
C	I don't know I don't know it's just
A	I'll make a note of that cos it's
C	it was on the BBC website if I had more hours in my day
A	yeah well that's what I'm thinking if I'd if I'd known about this last June I could have sat doing it all and
C	no it only made the news this week
A	okay
C	so it was on the BBC erm and it was in the local Cambridgeshire news for it my eldest sister actually heard it on BBC radio Cambridgeshire
A	mm
C	but it always surprises me when cos this is the only known record of of this sort of thing in the country
A	yeah
C	and growing up I always thought of Peterborough as a big city and the older I've got I've realised how little it actually is
A	mm
C	but when you get this sort of thing that's that makes us unique or puts us in not in the headlines but puts us in the news erm I get very excited
A	mm yeah I think it's just really interesting anyway just even to read and see what people have put
C	yeah yeah
A	so I love erm graveyards I love tombstones
C	I do
A	absolutely love them
C	oh good I thought it was only me I thought I was a bit of a weirdo
A	oh no no do I mean I used to when I was a teenager I used to do a couple of paper rounds
C	mm
A	and one was the evening one and I used to go and I'd cut through the church and I always used to when I had time go and and just read and you sort of look and see how old people are and the family and
C	yeah
A	erm you know like they had two children or three children that died and then there's one that died in the forties and you think actually look one of them made it and just
C	yeah
A	oh I love yeah love it
C	my dad comes from a little village near
A	what village?
A	oh yeah I know that yeah
C	it's very little I fact when he was when he was born you had
A	yeah
C	and the graveyard yeah by by erm grandparents are buried there my dad was an only child but his grandad his dad my grandad was one I think of thirteen that survived so
A	yeah
C	erm but loves I love going to the graveyard
A	mm
C	and erm but there were quite a few large families as well and I I said to my dad at I remember like I don't think I was even in my teens I said look at all these babies that died why were the babies all dying?
A	mm
C	and he said erm because there'd be a a family grave and the children all made and when you look at the dates that they died as well they'd perhaps be within two weeks or a month
A	yeah
C	and he said it would be what did he say? scarlet fever? And the children would be like you know a few days old and then there'd be another one that'd be about eighteen months and one would be three and five
A	yeah it's like the whole family yeah yeah
C	and yeah and all the children at least were all wiped out within
A	yeah
C	er you know a month two months of each other
A	mm must be horrendous
C	cos I just thought it was that babies died
A	yeah
C	and then when he when explained to me don't just look at how old they were look at the dates that they that they died
A	yeah
C	likewise and I heard something on the radio the other day erm one of the one of the a couple were passed away and then within a very very short time maybe days or just weeks afterwards the other partner would would pass
A	yeah
C	sometimes it was because of diseases spreading or or war or
A	yeah
C	whatever it might be erm but I heard it was so sad I was driving along it was only a lunchtime or something and there was a phone-in about it and a lady said that her grandfather was diagnosed with cancer
A	mm
C	and erm it had got to the point where it was terminal and then his wife her grandmother was diagnosed with a similar illness as well and she passed away first they were both being cared for but they were together
A	mm
C	and she passed away and forty-eight hours later their grandfather passed away
A	yeah yeah
C	and he had always said to her I will never leave you I will never ever leave you on your own and they said that he waited until she had gone
A	mm yeah and then
C	and then he he
A	yeah
C	gave in then basically
A	yeah my gran and grandad were in a car crash
C	oh
A	erm when well I was actually pregnant with
C	yeah
A	seven mile straight and the five mile straight they they were coming out the side and it was one of these before they started doing all the warning stuffs obviously erm and someone went into them both in hospital erm I think my grandad I'm not sure if he actually died straightaway or he died almost like straightaway when he was in hospital erm and my gran was injured but was you know thought to be okay
C	yeah
A	erm and she was big larger than life total dominant you know and he was this little the typical like the you know the postcard with the big the big wife and then the little tiny henpecked husband
C	little stick man
A	he was great he was lovely but it was like you know do this
C	yeah
A	you know in tune and and happy right through and yeah it's funny isn't it?
C	mm
A	it's funny I think that's why when people talk about your attitude and
A	positive mental attitude you know and it and it is a lot to be said for it isn't it? because it you you it keeps your spirit going keeps you going
C	oh definitely yeah yeah and even just sort of day-to-day you see that people people that you live with or that you work with
A	mm mm mm
C	you know you only need to say them what's what's got into you? you know give yourself a shake come on
A	yeah yeah yeah
C	and then and make the effort they can be quite tiring I
A	yeah
C	but I make the effort to either cover it or to make think something else and I can't if I'm answering phones as often I can't sound fed up when I answer the phone
A	no no that's right
C	even if I'm up to my eyeballs in something
A	yeah yeah
C	it's it's it's the effort you put into it and it does affect other people around you god what I've worked with some miserable people
A	yeah
C	really really miserable and they've you know got genuine reasons to be sometimes and other times they're just not happy unless they're being miserable
A	yeah yeah no I know what you mean
C	bringing other people down
A	yeah yeah yes
C	I know it can be hard but oh god you spend what is it? nine hours of your of your life every day with people at work
A	mm mm
C	you can at least try your best to make it as enjoyable as possible
A	exactly
C	mm
A	exactly
C	be miserable at home
A	so how's everything going at work? is it all ticking along nicely?
C	yeah yeah it's got a bit quiet at the moment
A	mm
C	I'm catching up on things that I promised I'd do about six months ago
A	it's quite nice when you get a time like that cos you think achievement it's like a big endorphin
C	it is yeah yeah
A	tick done that
C	and I started an NVQ level four in business administration so it's quite in-depth and erm the start got delayed and delayed hi
B	you alight?
C	yeah good love you?
B	yeah
C	got delayed because it's er we had a an assessor assigned to us who erm was then changed to another lady who made two appearances and then left the company she'd only just joined them
A	right
C	erm and we've not got a new assessor haven't met her but I've had several conversations with her she's fab really fab
A	mm
C	so I've just started it erm I think Christmas Eve I submitted my first erm task it was a it was a report supporting sustainability in the business environment
A	oh lovely
C	recycling really
A	yeah yeah yeah
C	same thing really erm and I surprised myself cos I've got one that's been at the back of my mind that I need to do which is a two and a half thousand word target
A	right
C	and this other one that I did is three and a half thousand and that I hadn't realised
A	no
C	I hadn't realised and I thought well that's good anyway and I submitted it and I said look this is my first one I'd really appreciate your feedback on the layout the format the tone everything else and she rang me up and she said did you get my message? cos we have to log into a portal and that's how we communicate
A	right yeah
C	and you don't get you don't get any notification that there's a message there
A	no you just have to log in
C	you just have to keep logging in now and again
A	that's a bit annoying they ought to have an alert coming through to your email
C	it is it's really rubbish
A	yeah
C	erm so she rang and she said did you get my message? and I said no I haven't logged in whenever it was last week one day and she said well I've I've erm given you some feedback on your report like oh right okay she said it's fantastic she said I couldn't fault it she said I actually if it's alright with you I want to use it as an example of what other students should be looking at
A	very good yeah
C	oh she said is that okay?
A	you gonna have that?
B	yeah did you use
A	yeah
C	erm and she said I I cannot fault it in any way
A	yeah
C	she said and I've given you a hundred percent
A	that's really good wow
C	but then I thought crap I've really set the the bar now haven't I?
A	yeah exactly yeah yeah
C	that was an easy enough one but
A	yeah but it shows though that you're on the right track you're including the right stuff you're backing it up with
C	exactly evidence
A	whatever you yeah evidence that's the word
C	yes yeah and she said to me she said in terms of the format the layout the tone she said you don't even need to think about it you're just doing it anyway so she said I said well that takes that pressure off
A	yeah
C	if it's only just the content end then
A	yeah yeah
C	we'll get through that then
A	you've just got to research and think and put it down do it in the same way and yeah that bodes well
C	mm yeah well it helps that I head up the admin team so it's my responsibility to make sure every quote that goes out every bit of communication everything on the website every even down to templates that the customer service team use for letters or emails that are going
A	yeah yeah yeah mm
C	and yet I love when
A	mm yeah yeah
C	and it basically taught you some of the skills that you'd need to become a team leader
C	or that you would you would you would need to use as a team leader and it was things like erm report writing presenting erm training coaching
A	right that's really useful cos people already expect you to be able to do that don't they?
C	yeah
A	if you can do your job you should be able to do all the bits like that
C	yes exactly you don't need to be promoted to that job
A	yeah yeah
C	we don't need to tell you what to do
A	yeah
C	to do it
A	yeah
C	part of it was being team leader for something like two weeks
A	mm
C	so they just roll through and it
A	mm
C	for one reason or another it took eighteen months and
A	yeah
C	so we were holding each other's hand all the way along
A	yeah yeah
C	we had to put a presentation together and then present it to the general manager and erm the two er they were called controllers so there was a service controller and a sales controller
A	mm
C	erm we we had to present it at eleven o'clock at half nine we get together and go right we have to write a presentation now PowerPoint going erm okay what shall we say?
A	yeah oh yeah
C	we're both like mm
A	yeah
C	mm
A	and other times you just go bang bang and it's almost like your subconscious and your reflexes and what's in there bang bang bang there and it's just like that's perfect don't touch it leave it that's alright
C	yeah or you or you or you start off you put things down and think no I'll change it and you end up running full circle and going back to where you started from
A	yeah yeah yeah yeah mm
C	yeah oh I've had plenty of those days but I I I love I must be a bit of a classroom show off really I was always one of the oh oh I know I know
A	yeah yeah
C	I know the answer and I and I I do like erm with these all these recruitment agencies sometimes we'll say to them can you do can you get the candidates to do literacy tests and numeracy tests and I'll always say can I do the test as well?
A	yeah
C	just so I know then when when the candidate when you come back and say a candidate scored seventy-five percent or whatever it was
A	yeah you know what it is compared to you as such yeah
C	yeah exactly you know what they've gone through and some of the questions we did it with one and I think he'd scored forty-five percent one of my colleagues said that's shit I said you try the test
A	yeah
C	I said er there were something like fifteen questions and it's you've got a clock ticking down at about I can't remember how many
A	yeah
C	so my score was only something like seventy percent
A	yeah
C	erm and when you see how difficult the questions were getting as well they were they were really hard
A	and when for you it didn't matter if you got it right or wrong whereas that's the pressure for somebody thinking I've got to get this for the job or
C	yeah exactly I wasn't under any pressure none whatsoever and I made him take it
A	yeah yeah yeah no
C	you sucker
A	right
C	until next week I think and then it's being er taken back into private ownership
A	mm
C	the guy that erm created the business
A	yeah
C	he floated it it it he floated it on the stock market so it became a PLC but he's now taking control of that but he's he's stepping aside a little bit so we've got a new CEO coming in erm so we'll wait and see if that changes anything or throws anything into the mix
A	mm have you met him yet or?
C	I haven't met him but I spoke to him I I've been saying to my because my MD was reporting to him directly
A	mm
C	so erm because my MD
A	dunno sure to find that out
C	I
A	yeah
C	and then the other three days he's in our head office in Lancashire or anywhere else around the country that he needs to be so one day he's in the office I mentioned it to him again and he went oh yeah he in his phone he went this is his number
A	mm
C	erm and he he met with him on Friday for coffee he said this is his number get in touch with him and arrange us meet all we've said is Friday he said I don't know where he lives in Warwick somewhere in between Warwick and Peterborough oh
A	yeah
C	erm so I rang the guy up and he's lovely he's so so nice erm on the phone anyway erm and I've found because he'd said I'm I'm not I don't I don't care where we meet he said I'm I'm not fussed he said it can be you know in a service station or something like that
A	mm
C	no I'm not having my MD meeting his new boss
A	no meeting yeah no exactly
C	I found this beautiful I think it was called something like

C	I enjoy doing that sort of thing
A	yeah
C	checked that it was
A	yeah I like organising stuff
C	I don't like relying on other people
A	no I like to get it all done and sorted so you know that's the finished package and that's what's gonna happen
C	yeah
A	off we go and do it
C	when I was doing organising the Christmas party for the head office because I'm not there one of the girls that was there was meant to be doing bits and pieces for me erm and she was a PA as well and I said to
A	right
C	and then all of a sudden I looked at her email signature and it said now said that she was the PA she was doing this role instead of the other girl I said to

C	and I said it's cullen skink he said it's what? I said cullen skink have you have you ever heard of it before I said it's tradition it's Scottish tradition he said he said I've of a skink I said yeah they're a legless
A	yeah yeah
C	and you're meant to make it with smoked haddock and cod we just had erm salmon and cod and I put some prawns in it as well he said d'you know I'm so tired today? I said this isn't going to help then by the time we've finished it we were both of us on two elbows
C	it was so warm and rich and creamy and comforting as we were eating it we were falling asleep it was lovely
A	mm back in a sec
C	how's work going then
B	erm yeah it's going alright erm little bit quiet at the minute so it's quite nice I'm not like rushed or anything like that
C	yeah
B	erm but erm yeah I'm a deputy team leader now
C	oh yeah your mum said you were going to do that was that is that kind of permanent now then? cos I know you were to fill in for somebody
B	erm no but that was I went for a team leader that was
C	yeah
B	was a temporary one
C	yeah
B	I didn't get that one but they said that my application was really good and that I passed all the criteria I just wasn't high up enough
C	oh you good
B	and there were people above me
C	yeah
B	but I wasn't far off getting one of the positions
C	that's excellent well done
B	er but no I I cover for team leaders when they're not in
C	yeah
B	so that's that's permanently so like when there's if there's team leader off we we cover them there's a few members of the new team
C	excellent
B	er yeah it's good cos I want to try and request that I don't want to say as just another
C	yeah yeah and you've got opportunity to do that you can see opportunity can you?
B	yeah erm yeah I'll just just give my
C	yeah or push one down the stairs or something
B	yeah that's slightly
C	yeah
B	so and there ends up being yeah lots of people trip up them and trip down them you might as well take the lift it's just safer
C	until that gets stuck
B	yeah but well we've got two but one of them always breaks down if if that was the one that comes down we're like do I risk it? have I got my phone on me? or am I by myself cos if not you might get stuck in the lift
C	as l long as you've got enough battery on your phone hi
B	yeah it is yeah exactly it just it likes breaking down that one one one of them the other one's fine it always works so mm yeah it's good
C	oh good you say it's not so busy at the minute?
B	yeah
C	quietened down a bit
B	yeah it's nice cos we were getting a bit mental in the summer
C	yeah I can imagine
B	a bit mad but no no it's got a lot er a lot quieter now so it means we can like look at erm bettering ourselves and things like that doing things that we want to do while it's quieter you can start looking at things a bit more
C	yes yeah
B	and then obviously it gets busier again so this is the opportunity to to
C	breathe in
B	exactly it was definitely mental
C	yeah that's the thing when you work in a er like a seasonal company it's it's you don't just plan your day or your week or your month you almost have to plan the year don't you?
B	yeah we do we've got lots of new people employed erm like this year and try to put things in place to you know when it gets quite quite busy but
C	mm yeah
B	we'll see er we're doing a trial at the minute to see whether or not we can eliminate erm all the documents needing to be sent in so I'm part of that which has been quite fun
C	oh good
B	but we just have to see what management think whether they think long term it's something that'll work or not
C	mm
B	it's erm there's lots of stuff going on at the minute we're getting first aid trained at the beginning of next month which is one of those three days courses
C	oh oh wow
B	so that should be good be a fully-trained first aider
C	yeah
B	I'll be
A	yeah cos she's got the they do they've got the first aid
C	emergency first aid at work
A	yeah it's for the main floors so erm this'll be three of us so
C	mm that'll be excellent
A	mm it's good
C	I erm I was emergency first aider at work and that expired just before Christmas and I said to erm to our finance director I said I won't renew it for myself to be honest I did it because my children well they weren't little
A	mm
C	erm and I just thought you know when you've got kids it anything can happen and it you you it just helps it just gives that bit more confidence doesn't it? I said but I know that there are some other people that have mentioned it to me erm that would be interested in doing them so I'll give somebody else a chance
A	mm
C	I need to organise that actually thank you
A	I'm just reminding you
C	yeah yeah but I was thinking about it in the week cos I took my certificate down so it's left a space on the wall and every time I walked passed it I think mm
A	you see the space it's like ah yes need to do that
C	yeah well I'd left it up over Christmas and then registered that it was it was out of date you know in the in the in my mind I knew it was out of date I need to organise somebody but I thought If I take it down it'll be another prod
A	tomorrow morning you'll walk in and go ah need to need to do I
C	first aid
A	have you got room now?
C	yeah I'm done now thank you
B	we already have quite a few first aiders at work
A	well it's a big building isn't it?
C	how many are there? people who work there?
B	well we've got three floors of people erm I think there's I don't think there's a thousand I think it's under a thousand but yeah there's quite a fair few I'm not sure exactly how many we already have quite a few first aiders erm distributed
C	yeah
B	we've got two on our floor and I'll be the third well in our command area
C	yeah cos we've got well we are we've we've been in that building for ten years and as the
A	yeah it makes sense cos if somebody isn't there yeah definitely
C	and it covers the holidays and things as well yeah yeah yeah and we've just introduced for the first of January we've just introduced sick pay
A	oh right
C	our benefits have increased so we were required by our parent company to coming up for three years ago in April and at that point we'll all have we've all stayed on our own contracts so we've got twenty-five days holiday plus all the bank holidays parent company you start on twenty days and then after you've done so long I think it's like after you've done two years or a a full calendar year a full January to December so if you started on the second of January no that's the first working day third of January tough tits you've got to do all that year and then a full calendar year
A	yeah and then yeah
C	you would then get an incremental day's holiday each year erm so we've always been able to say when we're recruiting this is one thing that makes our benefits
A	yeah
C	or when we send people for inductions you know it's don't mention that we get twenty-five days holiday cos they don't don't mention that we get Bupa because they don't
A	yeah
C	erm but from the first of January it's been streamlined as much as possible so everybody else now gets twenty-five days but we've also had the been given the opportunity to buy a holiday up to five days and we all also get a day for our birthday
A	oh yeah? right
C	so my birthday's in April and I don't have to take the day I can take any day within my birthday month
A	oh that's nice
C	and that's a full day yeah it is it is cos
A	mm
C	erm so I've bought those three days this year so I can still do that but not dip out on my holiday yeah
A	not lose your holiday holiday yeah
C	yeah
A	mm yeah
C	erm so that's been really good that's been we thought a lot more people might take
A	yeah?
C	so I said to our finance director you know the team er team manager is signing them all off it's one of the busiest teams I do hope they're gonna have the resource to cover and extra five weeks of holiday in that team which is what they're basically going to give he said well he's authorising it's his job to cover the resource
A	yeah I suppose if they've got the option that they can buy five days holiday he can't say no can he?
C	no well we did ask this question of HR and they said he'd have to put a very good business case across
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker C works in a very well-known company.	Neutral
A	yeah
C	and you might say well you've all requested five days we because of this or because of work load we'll give you all four days or three days or none of you are going to get it but it'd have to be a business case and all of them be giving the same answer but one of the other benefits we've introduced as well is paid sick
A	yeah
C	paid sicknesses which we haven't had you'd have to be off for four working days and then SSP kicks in
A	mm
C	but erm we've now get paid sick and where are we today? eighteenth aren't we? yeah it's my niece's birthday yeah the eighteenth and we've had more sickness than than we've had before
B	mm that's the thing there isn't I think you know if you're
C	well this is what has been said yeah
[ANNOTATION]	They're not getting paid for sick leave.	Contradiction
B	whereas now if you've got the option like now if I'm if I'm like in my probation when I felt ill I went in and I really shouldn't have gone in at one point my glands was like out here and I was really bad and I had two bouts like that but I still went in because I didn't want to affect my probation now if I got that I'd probably be like I'm not going in
C	well this is the thing that we we were talking about it and erm er yeah we're we're a small company our teams are I think the largest team has got six people in
A	mm
C	so there's three four five six people teams you know if one person is off it it really impacts the others if it's not holiday if it's not planned resource-wise
A	yeah yeah
[ANNOTATION]	All the employees have at least a master's degree.	Neutral
C	so and also we we just lose a day's pay or two days' pay or whatever it might be so you'd go into work and you'd cough and splutter and then twenty-four hours later
A	yeah and then your rest of the team
C	twenty-four hours later somebody else would say oh I've got the you know er I think I'm coming down with it erm so we can imagine now instead of people battling for a week and then giving in on a Friday but they've given it to another four people who are gonna battle for a week and give it another
A	yeah
C	they'll take a couple of days off get rid of it and come in and nobody else would have caught it and so in the long-run
A	yeah it is benefit
C	it will save on
B	well that's that's right I mean we had someone that was on
C	er
B	and I was like you do realise you've got a sickness? like you're gonna pass that on to people
[ANNOTATION]	Some employees can get corona virus and ask for a sick leave.	Neutral
A	yeah
B	I said it's not fair I said cos like this was last year and I had lots of stuff that I had coming up and I was like I cannot be ill cos if I'm ill and I give it to my nan she can't go and visit her sister and she can't do this
C	yeah yeah
B	and all this sort of stuff and I'm like so you've got to think of the impact and like
A	yeah sickness is
C	you can't manage it at work either can you?
[ANNOTATION]	If speaker B get any illness, he/she will pass it through other people.	Entailment
A	no exactly no
B	if you've got a cold you can usually come in but
A	yeah that's it's it's to be clever about it isn't it?
B	yeah yeah this is it but it was a real grotty grotty cold and you're spluttering coughing trying to
B	exactly
A	yeah couple of days off definitely if it's a bit of a sniffle you think oh actually it's a bit of a sniffle you then you go in don't you?
B	before Christmas like we had our Christmas party on Friday the
A	mm mm
C	erm and he phoned in sick on Monday and he said he'd got hand foot and mouth
A	mm
C	I had that when
C	one of them was one of our guys in engineering so I don't know how that happened but we think cos they were buying round after round of erm Jägerbombs
A	yeah
C	and they were using the you know the all-in-one looks a bit like a candle holder
A	mm
C	the all-in-one erm cup
A	yeah
C	but we don't think that or glass I think they were plastic but they weren't don't think they were washing them cos they were buying so many at a time
A	mm yeah
C	it would have been a lot to wash sterilise and get out again
A	that's it they probably just swished them out and
C	yeah so we think that's how it went around
A	or we went back and said oh use the same glasses and that somebody actually got mixed over or ever just touching the glasses if somebody was carrying it
C	well they put them all on a tray and then the tray was going back so there was absolutely no way you could get the same one again
A	no no no
C	erm but one of the girls she come she she she phoned in they have to phone in every day and speak to me cos she said I feel absolutely fine she said I feel well enough to work
A	yeah yeah
C	but I'm contagious she said I don't want to lose
A	yeah
C	but chances are that somebody else will catch it from me and when we found out it was on a Friday afternoon we thought oh god okay I need to tell everybody there's going to be panic so I sent out an email to say we've had at that point here instances of this this is what it is this is a link to the NHS website about it have a look at it look out for symptoms I'm coming round with antibacterial wipes and we wiped every single surface in that building well in those two buildings entrance doors light bulbs taps the kettle handles every single thing fridge handles everything we could think of erm so we didn't have sick pay at that point but I I sat down with the finance director on Friday and I said look these people have had this you know we said to one of them that's fine we don't want you in we're telling you not to come in cos you're contagious so we'll pay you and she said now it'll be exactly the same for all four of them so yeah something like that like you say about passing things on
A	yeah yeah mm
C	you don't want anything that's gonna spread
B	no exactly like I can't believe most people will manage a cold even if it's a nasty one like you you get it and you're like for goodness sake I've got this cold but you're you're not gonna be laid up for it you know if somebody comes in with their sickness bug that can have a big effect on people especially because obviously our office is quite big and we've usually got two or three people pregnant at a time and if it gets to them you think it's not fair to give something like that to them
C	yeah exactly
B	I mean a cold again if someone is pregnant has a cold they have a cold but sickness bugs it's not right
C	no it's
A	no
B	cos they've got massive like air conditioning our air conditioning vents are huge they're huge machines
C	oh god so what it goes spread around
B	everything spread because obviously we have to keep the air conditioning in there because and we can't have there there's no windows
C	mm
B	there's vents but there's no windows cos it's just like a glass building
C	yeah
B	so obviously the windows are so big someone could jump out of it it was a window so they have vents
A	and sometimes they might want to
A	god I've had enough
B	erm so we have vents but the vents level with the air conditioning so they stay shut
A	mm
B	so it's all run on air conditioned air so everything just gets passed round so so fast in our place like you'll hear about it on the second floor and you'll go it's coming our way then
C	like a wave
B	no cos someone we have
C	germs
B	everything and the mail room yeah and the mail room people as well they walk round the building so there's two lots generally you'll see wandering round the building they pass the germs from floor to floor so you just know you're get it if it's on the second floor it's coming to the third floor at some point
C	yeah
B	but erm yeah but
C	yeah some of these things you can't avoid can you?
B	no but if it is yeah usually there's some form of cold or something going round
C	erm one of our ladies well a couple of them actually have got really bad erm well one girl she's got she's got food allergies
B	yeah
C	but it's not just gluten or wheat or nuts it's erm she can't eat anything from the oh I can't remember what it's called family of vegetables that includes broccoli cabbage sprouts there's quite a few in there erm yeast
A	mm
C	which is in so many more things than you think it's gonna be in
A	oh yeah yeah
C	cos I said to her the other day erm because she she can't eat flour she can't eat normal gluten or she can't eat normal flour because of the gluten I think it is erm so if there are cakes around somebody often bring brings fruit as well and I said to
A	mm yeah
C	oh
A	yeah
C	so difficult but it doesn't take much if she accidently eats something that triggers it and she's in agony and you'll see her sitting here like this and I'll say to her
A	yeah
C	so she will just sit there in in agony
B	mm
C	quite literally agony erm until and she just we would see the colour draining from her during the day
B	you want to tell her to get erm maybe she's got one like one of those mini hot water bottles cos sometimes that can
C	she has them yeah
B	cos I cos I if my stomach's playing I use one of them I sit with one of them on my stomach and just sit and hold it and it's help with all
C	it's it's a bit of a a bit of a erm a laughing point in our office because there are so many girls that for one reason or another one of them is she's got the the figure of a seven year old well she's she's chesty but she's very very tiny she's about a size four I think
A	yes yeah
C	erm and where she sits she refuses to move cos she likes the the the position but it's directly beneath the air con vents but we don't often have the air con on but then when the MD is in he likes fresh air in his office
A	mm
C	and erm the the it's the glass walls with the glass door so you haven't got doors that seal erm and when he's not in his office he
B	yeah that's the same with our with our boss he does
C	so if the window is open there's a bit of a a breeze
A	yeah
C	well I'm where his door opens I've got a glass screen that comes in front of mine I'm in a little alcove basically so I don't feel anything
A	no no
C	if it's over-warm in the office I don't really notice it is it's drafty I don't feel it if the air con's on I barely get a waft of it
A	yeah
C	but erm one of the the this lady that I was talking about she'll even in the summer when we don't have the air conditioning on she'll sit in a thick cardigan because windows are open and there's a nice breeze but she feels she really feels the cold erm and we must have four or five hot water bottles at any
A	yeah
C	one of the girls got one for Christmas from secret Santa
A	yeah
C	as well cos hers was a bit tatty
C	and I knitted a cover for one girl
A	did you?
B	the thing is in our building like erm I came in once in summer and I was dressed in like in leggings and a dress and I had a cardigan
C	yeah
B	and
C	mm
B	it's literally freezing even in the summer you're like frozen
C	mm
B	because they have to have it because of the way the building is set out it's very it's all open plan
C	yeah
B	apart from a few offices like we've got erm like there's my boss's boss's boss her they've got individual offices but everyone else we're all in open plan so if one air conditioning is put up to say it's
C	right
B	cos if one's put on thirty the ones that are on twenty-four start overcompensating
C	oh
B	and blowing out
C	mm mm
B	cos the air conditioning cools it it's just like a giant fridge so you can leave your leave your lunch inside and it's fine
C	nice and chilled
B	yeah but it's it is quite cold I mean like it's not too bad now because they've managed to get it we've got the air conditioning so it's mostly now it's warm where I was sat I was directly under where it hit
C	yeah
B	and I was cold constantly so my boss moved me erm she swapped me someone else and I've now sat and it would actually it goes just over me now it's not bad but I was literally frozen I was sat in my coat it'd be that cold it's like we can't do this and we had sort of like a phase where we don't know why but it was blowing I think it was because we've got heating but they'd moved a load of erm cos they were doing
C	that's rubbish isn't it?
B	yeah and we should
C	no no no
B	and then the ones we did have then got blocked in as well and we were like but now they've moved them back in cos they've done the work they've moved the lockers back so it's actually it's been lovely
C	heatwave
B	it's nice it's actually a bit warm it's not not hot but it's a bit warmer that in it was so
C	probably does
C	who planned that?
B	I don't it's so so such a silly design and I don't know I think it was the only place they could put the erm air conditioning vent that where a group sort of like by the I don't know health and safety and everyone like that so that they distributed it right but they are just directly above the heating which means that they just don't know what the temperature is and it's like it's not twenty-four degrees in here it feels more like sort of fifteen sixteen degrees it's really cold
C	yeah
B	I was just thinking of getting
C	actually
B	that's not right
C	yeah
B	but there's nothing they can do it about it now because the way it's designed is the way it's designed I don't think they can change it
C	mm
B	er no somebody we'll be sat there and somebody'll go oh the air conditioning's gone on cos obviously it's one of the ones that goes on a lot like it's on power save so when so we get a draft like blow in your ear it's like year air conditioning's coming on
C	yeah our boiler not last winter the winter
A	yeah space heaters
C	glowing orange with this heating coming out oh god had to hire these all around the building it was lovely it was so toasty with this warm air blowing instead of just a radiator emitting a bit of heat
A	yeah
C	actually have the warm air blowing around
C	but it was so dry we were drinking tonnes and all erm you know dry lips dry skin as well so of course we were complaining
A	we've got one of those the erm the big ones
C	yeah
A	it's down in the garage
B	but your hands would be so numb
C	oh be a
B	you wouldn't be able to
C	no I know to put it on the packet
B	I used to I used to go and put it on
A	yeah it's like this little tiny garage and
C	no
B	mm but I I was told when I had it on that you had to leave the garage door open just a little bit
A	yeah they told me that for the fumes you know so you'd have the garage door open about a little bit and then they'd go more than that more than that then he'd open it about that much and then we used to have the dog then didn't we? and
B	I used to like that though cos he used he used to pop in we used you know there was as barrier of where we could go cos he didn't come to close to the socks cos he moulted like anything so he'd get them covered with dog hairs so you know he'd come in then come and just stand and look at me and he'd stand there for another couple of minutes and he'd keep me company and then he'd be like right I'm going
C	yeah
B	so I'd always let him out even if it was like
C	it's not interesting
B	exactly
C	yeah
B	wasn't exciting
B	it was nice kept kept kept you company you felt like you were being watched and like dog's there bless him
C	would you have another dog if you didn't travel as much?
A	well I I wouldn't have a dog at all cos I'm not into animals at all apart from fish
C	mm
A	erm
C	mm or if you have yeah if you have to go away or
B	I suppose it depends because like a lot there's people that I know that do have dogs and they both and they both work but what they tend to do is I know
A	mm
B	so well he she'll leave early in the morning and he'll do
A	mm
B	like up to a point and then he goes
C	yeah
A	mm
B	and she does that and in in the day sometimes cos they've got a puppy
C	mm
B	so the puppy needs a lot more looking after and they've also got
C	yeah
B	they've also got a bigger dog that's now safe an ex-police dog which was he was a
A	no
C	yeah
B	apart from him and he could then train it and cos he he'd been the trainer so with it being a big dog he took it he he took it home so it's it's fine with
A	mm
C	oh yeah ours is brilliant
A	mm
C	and
A	mm
C	we come down in the morning the first thing I do is let the cat in or if the cat's been in overnight if it's been really cold first thing I would let her out
A	yeah
B	escape
C	yeah goes for wee and then she's back again to come straight back in
A	yeah yeah
C	erm Holly won't go out
A	mm
C	she won't go out in the morning for a wee
A	no?
C	no and I'll try it again before we all go to work
A	mm
C	she might if she if she goes out she runs down the path and goes
A	mm
C	and then we get home from work erm cos we'd come home like I say at lunchtime or the girls would pop in and they'd say mum Holly won't go out
A	mm
C	come home from work she'd do the same run down the path and back again and it's only then normally we'll get changed and take her straight out
A	yeah
C	and when she's half way round the park she'll go right I'll have my wee now
A	yeah
C	ah and she's there forever and you see her little face
A	yeah
B	I think it's when when you take your dog for a walk generally they get used to going on the walk so they don't go in the garden
C	yeah
A	no cos it's they think it's like an extension of the house that they shouldn't go in maybe
C	yeah
B	yeah yeah exactly whereas the girls go in the garden because they don't go for walks they've got such a big garden that they the back door's open pretty much
C	yeah
A	mm
B	so they go out in the garden
C	yeah
B	but again they'll only go there's certain areas that they'll go in
C	yes yeah
B	cos it's they're the areas they're supposed to use
C	yeah
B	so I think that's what it is the dogs when you take them for a walk that's when they go to the loo so if you took her for a walk in the morning she probably would go
C	yeah probably probably
A	mm
B	even if you literally just took her for a quick loop round the
C	park yeah
B	like round the place or whatever then she probably would go
A	one of these days you'll find there's a tiny little pool behind one of the chairs you haven't realised and she just goes and just a little bit of a release
B	well dogs are pretty good they'll only go if they're absolutely desperate
A	yeah
B	like we've had occasionally over the road where they've been in for a while and you can tell they're desperate cos they go to the door and then they go by the door cos they know they're supposed to be going out but they they can't actually go out
C	yeah close as they can get
A	mm
B	the thing is you is like you say you've let them out and they haven't gone so you think oh they're fine and then all of the sudden it's like oh okay you needed to go okay that's fine
C	yeah the only time Holly's
B	yeah
C	that's the only time she'll
B	but then then they'll look and be like oh look mum I'm really sorry I shouldn't have gone in the house
C	yeah
A	oh yeah yeah yeah
C	and he he was cross with her and I said why? he said cos she did it on the living room carpet I said but she was sick
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	and he said yes but she was sick cos she ate the grass
B	she ate the grass cos she was unwell
C	yeah but she ate the grass cos she didn't feel well
A	that's right they eat the grass to make themselves be sick because they know they're not well
C	yeah
A	yeah exactly
C	yeah I mean she
C	yeah but you can't
C	yeah no no
B	Paige Paige sits on my lap sometimes she'll get up and she's a labrador she sits on my lap and she'll sit there sometimes and she'll go
B	she gets it's cos she's getting older and she does it a lot
A	mm
B	and she nibbles on her own hair a lot I think she's getting hair
C	yeah
A	yeah
B	like and hair but
C	I've cleaned up so much child sick and
A	yeah
C	I really can't be doing with it and I say to
A	no
C	I've never I've never had one never interested in having one so I said okay if if if we get one it's your dog you clean up after it
A	mm mm
C	you have to be the one committed to walk her I don't want to walk her all the time
A	no
C	and this time of year when it's dark I don't want to go out
A	no
C	so
A	your dog
C	you signed up for it I didn't
A	yeah
C	no I've I've me and my cat
A	mm
C	she's great I love the independence that cats have yeah she can't
B	whereas I prefer dogs cos they like being all cuddly and need you
A	mm
B	yeah
C	and some really snotty hoity-toity cats but mine's brill she's so lovely
A	mm
B	yeah
C	and she'll even allow the dog to lay near her
C	and she she'll be all curled up and the dog will get up
A	mm
C	in fact we bought her for Christmas
A	mm
C	and on the other side it's it's fabric and actually
A	yeah
C	so I'll have that on my lap and the cat and my knitting or something
A	mm
C	and and Holly'll Holly loves to sit between
A	mm mm yeah
C	she's she's labrador collie greyhound cross she's got this stupid thick long heavy tail that's constantly doing that
B	yeah they do
C	and the number of times she'll whack the cat
A	mm
C	and the poor cat will go flying
C	cos she can't bear it and then Holly's all smug and she'll put her her head on my lap and just try and fill the space that she's just accidently created
C	and yet the
A	mm
C	cos you you just it gets too warm for her so if the cat's on the other sofa Holly will climb on it so carefully
A	mm
C	and she'll turn around and she'll make sure she doesn't knock her because she knows that the cat wouldn't in that instance the cat wouldn't get off she'd swipe at her
A	yeah
C	so she turns around
B	she knows she's got she's got back up when she gets on the sofa she'll like I've got back up you can't hurt me yeah
C	she makes it so obvious yeah
B	yeah
C	as small as possible and sits all cramped up on the sofa and the cat's got all this space and again the cat's like that
A	mm watching her
C	she's lift her head up
A	but maybe Holly actually just wants to have company on the sofa and she knows if she gets on there and disturbs the cat the cat'll get off and go over and see you
C	yeah
A	or either way it's like but I want I want to sit on the sofa with somebody
C	yeah
A	so they get on really carefully are you going to stay on with me? stay on with me
C	the cat won't
A	no
B	no
A	no
C	we're waiting for the time when the cat realises actually this is a source of warmth and comfort
A	mm
B	yeah I'm ready to cuddle
C	I quite like it she hasn't done that yet but she will often so
A	mm
C	and she'll lick her face and she'll lick her eye and her eyelid eye her eyebrow and Holly's like that daren't move what do I do? what do I do? what do I do? I'm not gonna move I'm not gonna move and I'll say is cat giving you love Holly?
A	ah
C	so nice and she's like I don't know if it's nice or not I haven't decided
C	I'm not going to move in case I get my face clawed off
A	yeah oh that's sweet
C	they're so funny
B	that that is the thing with cats that I find though because they can be temperamental I mean
C	yeah
B	and it
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	mm
B	they do like me absolutely when I when I go over there I always get their names muddled up
A	mm
C	mm
B	out there but Bart doesn't Bart likes being inside so I'll go go over to the pair and visit her and erm he'll come straight out to me at the door and he'll come and say hello and he'll always give my shoes a sniff cos he can smell the the dogs on them
C	yeah
B	and then he'll come and he'll he'll spend all his time walking round my legs and come and try to play and I'll play with him I was playing with him with some string the other day and I was like string it along and then I'd then I'd do it on the floor to make him get ready and he'd get ready to pounce and he has a little tail when he pounces like and he pulls his bum
C	yeah yeah yeah
B	and then he jumps so then I would go whoop and move it and he'd do like a forward roll but he was great but no he does he does like me when I go when I go over and see them he's straight over to come and say hello and have a fuss and cuddle
C	see
B	they're great fun they are fun
C	just leave a cat and once I've let the cat in she'll she'll wander down the hall say hello to Holly go and have her biscuits and I'm by this time I'm upstairs getting ready in the bathroom and all I can hear is
A	yeah
C	and she's ruched it all up because she's been
C	sometimes we come home from work and and we can't oh oh the cat we can't get through the door cos she's pushed the mat up against it and I'll come down the stairs she'll like that under the kitchen table ah do you see the goblins? they're all around you they're all around you
B	they are so funny I erm I stayed over at my friend's and erm cos it was really windy and the bathroom window was open it blew my door open like it was it was in the morning so I was about ready to wake up anyway and I was like what's that? and all of a sudden I heard de de de de and two things jumped on me they were like the cats and they they sort of looked like who are you?
C	who are you? yeah
B	cos that's their room normally like the one they tend to do and like sit on the windowsill in
C	yeah
B	so I know
C	they are and I taught
B	oh it's great fun
C	at at Christmas time
B	you can
C	oh you can we've got erm the fan I don't know how I discovered it I think I must have dropped a nut on the floor one Christmas on the floor a few years ago hazelnuts the cat loves chasing them round cos she taps them and the roll and they kind of rattle a bit as well
A	yeah
C	so they and she'll he'll come in and he'll find her like this on the floor both front paws underneath the the sofa or the
C	so she'd been laying is she's laying on one of the sofas
C	cos they don't roll stop throwing Brazil nuts at the cat
A	she doesn't like Brazil nuts that's funny
B	oh no
C	what was that?
B	and she now doesn't like walnuts either
C	I said I can't believe you've thrown that walnut at the cat he said I really didn't mean it he said rubbish aim he said I could not have done that if I'd tried
C	I just went blink and
A	no
C	stop throwing things at the cat
B	yeah the the the puppy over the well she's not really a puppy anymore but I still call her a puppy she's about three now but she we found that she likes laser guns just as much as a cat
C	really?
B	so you'll get the laser gun she's like and then he'll do it at the wall
C	and she darts
B	and she she'll be like she can literally if you did it quite fast she goes vroom and she goes sliding cos they've got wooden floors
C	oh yeah
B	so she tries to stop and she slides out the room he he'll be doing it and then I found I sat on the floor with her and I was literally just doing it in front of her paws and she was like batting all around her she was just like a cat and I'm like this is really quite fun
C	oh wow I've never known a dog to be
B	yeah and you'd do it on the floor and she'll follow it round and like she she really excited cos it's a dot and she likes she she's fascinated by lots of stuff so she'll sit and watch the TV like actually watch what's going on and you see she's really studying what's happening anything reflective or anything like that she really likes watching it and she kept trying to chase it and catch it
C	yeah
B	all bugs she likes chasing bugs too
C	oh yeah
B	but she got a daddy longlegs and she get she gets in and she pops her her paws on it
C	what dog is she?
B	erm she's a springer spaniel so she pops her paws on it and she like bops it with her nose
C	mm
B	and then when she kills it she's really disappointed cos she's like it's not moving
C	yeah it's broken
B	she likes she likes them to move but she likes to like bop them bop them and bat them and stuff
C	yeah
B	and and like pick them up in her mouth and spit them out and stuff but then she gets really annoyed when they're dead and she's like with her nose like nudging it like
C	yeah
B	it's dead now
C	get me a new one
B	she'll follow it round the room like and she'll literally just like watch it with her nose and get ready and she'll watch she she basically is a bit like a cat in the playing sense cos she'll she she pounces on them and then she's like right I'm now gonna play with this bug until it dies and
C	we had erm the film Beethoven's Fifth on over New Year I think it was
A	that's the big St Bernard isn't it?
C	yes yeah and erm he meets a lady St Bernard and they end up having puppies that come and and stay in the house erm
A	see that's what
C	yeah
B	so like anything can be on and she'll she'll watch it she she erm I also found another amusement for myself I had my laptop just sat on my lap and the mouse she'll watch it and she like bops me because I don't mind my laptop cos it's not
C	yeah
B	she's like
B	it's gone move it back she's like ah there it is
C	I remember not long after some tablets Ipads that sort of thing started to become affordable erm there's a video clip came out and there were two cats and this er Ipad it was like a paint app
B	yeah
C	so you you just touch a screen wipe your finger and it would do different coloured paint trails erm and the the cats were sort of doing this on the and they they watch all these colours appear and they were doing that and and it was changing in front of them and I was absolutely fascinated with it cos their little paws have the same bit they can use can't they?
B	dogs noses do and dogs paws do as well the er the girls do on mine and I'm watching something and then one of the dog will do that and I'm like you turned it off
C	yeah
B	I wasn't done watching that
C	I've got a app on my phone and it it's just for counting rows I knit a lot so as rather than having a bit of paper and pen and having to go one row two rows I just tap on to on to this app and I'd got up to about forty-four yesterday and I keep it on the side of the of the sofa and the cat jumped on the arm because the door is that end into the living room she jumped up on the arm sat and just stared at
C	I said she wants feeding and he said make it just make it go away and the cat got bored so she walked all the way round I could hear this purring noise coming behind me and I she and she I and she must have stepped on my phone
A	yeah
C	it didn't fall or anything and I don't remember what how she did it but the next second I look back at it and it's gone from forty-four back to zero
A	yeah
C	it's weird she luckily I know how many what the hell's the cat doing?
A	she thought she she she's added another ten lines another ten rows
C	yeah yeah mm
B	yeah they do and because erm Trey doesn't like doesn't like it when you look at the phone or if you do like a she wants your attention to be focused on her
C	yeah
B	so she will put her face on it and like turn stuff off and I'm like don't do that it's really annoying
C	really annoying
B	I'm like I'm trying to use my Ipad and she like she'll put her face in front of it and like can't see a thing or I can see the dog's face like this this close to my face
C	yeah
B	but you can't watch anything with puppies cos she was an ex-breed
C	right
B	so anything when puppies comes on she goes mad
C	yes
B	she hears them barking she wants to find out why they're barking and get to them it makes her really anxious so we found that out by watching Hundred and One Dalmatians
B	cos erm the dog called Trey and obviously she's
C	yeah yeah that maternal instinct it's it's like you know I'm sure you'd do the same
B	mm yeah she'd be used for quite a few litters so that's a bit
C	if you're out and you hear a baby crying your heart rate it you can feel your heart rate going up
A	you get the
C	yes yeah yeah ooh
A	a newborn baby or a little baby crying I do
C	yeah
A	I do
C	it's bizarre
B	I didn't know what you meant that's why I looked at you
A	oh when you're filled with milk
C	it's like a a sharp tingling type thing that goes through your boobs
A	yeah and and it's like duh and it's like it's when the milk comes
C	and you just wait for that solid feeling to come don't you?
B	I don't know that but no I if I hear a baby I'm more like looking at like where is it and who's got
C	it's quite it makes you feel quite ill doesn't it sometimes?
A	yeah
B	or like a little kid crying I came out the ice rink the other day and there was a boy he must have been about four I would say just literally stood by the door sobbing and sobbing and
A	yeah yeah
B	cos that that was a little little tiny kid was sob it was literally sobbing away
A	probably wanted carrying up the steps or something
B	well he was throwing a tantrum
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	and the parents were obviously like we're going to ignore them and let him carry on with it they were in sight they were at the top of the steps and he was at the bottom
A	yeah where he is they could see him yeah
B	so they could see him and all they all just kept shouting at him to get him to come up the siblings were and the the parents had said no they were like we're not gonna
A	no
B	give in to his tantrum but every every single woman that comes out was like oh you could see them like oh god and then then they see the parents and they're like oh that's someone's child came out and they have little heart mini heart attacks and then you see them coming out
C	I've seen crying children before and I'm just really conscious and it's perhaps the wrong thing but really conscious of getting involved
A	mm
C	you know I'll I'll I'll look round for a parent
B	look a bit round for a parent yeah
C	that looks a bit panicky and try and match the two up
B	yeah
C	but you don't just you can't just or I feel I can't just walk up to a child talk to him take his hand and start walking around with him to try and find his
A	I've had it a few times in crazy odd places when kids cry and I I do if it's a
C	you're around them yeah
A	them like if if they're crying then you just I do I just go and stand look and then I'll just go and and I'll crouch down next to them don't get hold of them or anything
C	no
A	but I just start you know are you okay? what's the matter?
C	what what's mummy's name?
A	lost mummy or daddy or and then you're looking cos at some point there's going to be a parent look
C	come yeah
B	see didn't
A	yeah yeah in
B	right and I went just wandering up and down
A	yeah
B	and then literally saw this the the panic-stricken parent and you oh but this
A	yeah yeah there was a toddler and they can't even talk to you
C	yeah
B	well that's the thing I think it's when you just
A	were you with me that time when there were those teenage girls as well
B	yeah
A	cos there was a kid that was honestly panicked and lost the the parent and we sort of stopped and they these teenage girls came as well and they were like oh oh can we we'll help shall we take it? we'll take to them up to the and I kept saying no because we'll stay here so they
B	the mum won't have gone far
A	the mum will come back you know we'll we'll just
B	mm all all
A	oh but we we can take him and and it's like no just you know we just stay here or stand and wait and if necessary we'll go we'll get one of us you can go to a shop and say you need them to call through to get security to come here but we're not taking the kid from and then yeah and then again the parent appears and he's like ah
C	yeah get to the car got like shopping keys hand bag one two oh oh
B	that's it the parent won't get far without realising that one of their kids has gone what it normally is is you've got hold of the buggy and and you're sort of like there was one holding on the to buggy where's it gone?
A	yeah
B	and then you you that's when you go to retrace your steps and then move them and that causes real panic
A	yeah exactly
C	although my mum did leave one of my sister's at the butchers
C	outside in her pram she she partly
A	yes yes
C	carrier bags full got home and thought what else did I have?
A	something missing
C	I've I've hidden from
A	yeah
C	when
A	yeah
C	and I waited for her to suddenly go oh mummy turned around and couldn't see me and the fear in her face
A	yeah yeah
C	and just before she got to that absolute terror
A	yeah
C	I suddenly came from behind her and I said I said did you lose mummy? and she
A	oh no
C	it it really taught her a lesson
A	yeah exactly
C	yeah
B	that's the the thing so it's it's and you feel bad
C	no I didn't know no that's it I knew where she was and
B	we always had the lost children when I worked at H and M constantly had the security guards coming in looking for a small child that had got lost usually they were hiding in the clothes rails and things like that in the shop
C	yeah yeah they're playing aren't they?
B	but we had it a lot or you'd have you'd have a little one you'd have one little one crying and she'd said I've lost my mummy and I was like oh my god you know when you feel yourself go
C	I'll take you home
B	I I was bearing in mind I was probably about like what fifteen sixteen seventeen something like that I wasn't a hundred per cent what to do so I just sort of said took her up to a desk and one of the older ones said what do we do? so then she made an announcement for the mum you know we've got a child at
A	yeah
B	come here but I was like I was like I I didn't know what to do cos I hadn't been working there that long so then they were like next time I know what to do take just take him to a desk make the announcement and then that's fine but
A	do you remember when you were young what I used to tell you if you lost me when we were out shopping?
B	we had to go and find a policeman or like you tell them that you'd lost your mum
A	no
B	was it? I'm sure it was something like that
A	well yeah if you saw a policeman but I I always used to tell you if you lost me if you're in the shop you go to where you pay your money and shout loud I've lost my mummy or if you're out in the street go in to the shop right next to you and go and go up to the
B	I remember you saying about
A	yeah it was it was always like go to the shop go to the till go to where you pay you know and and shout really loud don't stand you know shout really loud I've lost my mummy or otherwise just group to a an adult you know you don't know who you're going to and then they they could say oh come over here and do you know I always though
C	I know your mummy come with me and
A	yeah yeah or even sort of genuinely meaning to try and help oh let's go and do whatever but at least if the last point that you saw me or realised that you've you know you're actually going up to that nearest shop or the nearest thing then in the shop they'll do an announcement or they'll at least you know someone's got you rather than you just wandering up and down the street going I think we came this way
C	yeah
A	but yeah do you I don't know do you remember when you lost me in what was it?
B	I was telling her
A	yeah in in
C	mm
A	I had one of those and she was toddling so erm I must have
C	realised it was you
A	she obviously must have glanced somewhere and then followed the mac looked up and was like oh yeah it was funny it's so easy when you actually think god yeah you know
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	funny
