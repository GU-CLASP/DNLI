C	you know we told you about the bird collecting Abi fur in the garden last year?
B	uh-huh
C	and we filmed it
A	the
B	oh is that the thing on Dropbox?
A	yes
C	mm
B	yeah
A	mm
C	no you should
B	I've
A	mm
C	it's really quite funny
B	I've got a list of things I need to look at
C	mm
B	online
C	and looking back to last year when we took that film it looks as though I need to start putting the fur out pretty quickly
A	it was about this time
C	mm
B	huh
A	last year
B	have they started taking it to build nests?
C	well I haven't put any out yet
C	Cos this is obviously the beginning of the nesting season
A	no
C	out there
A	no
C	I haven't seen that many birds at all
B	does anyone want a cup of tea?
A	I'd like one now
C	mm
A	thank you
C	yes?
A	mm
C	I don't think so thank you
B	okay
A	mm
C	ralphy
C	mm
A	mm
C	that's over a weekend
A	mm
C	and the concourse was absolutely empty by eleven o'clock
A	what did they do? Close the court for the rest of the
C	no
A	day?
C	no
A	mm
C	but that's a sign of
A	yeah
C	how little work is coming through
A	mm
C	and it's all because the police aren't charging
A	yeah
C	giving them fixed penalties and things like that rather than taking them through the courts
A	well
C	it's ridiculous
A	or it could mean there's no crime
C	yeah yeah yeah
C	yeah yeah
A	yeah
C	this morning
A	God
C	and there they were standing up there saying oh well he's doing this course and he might get a job at the end of it and blah blah blah
A	hmm
C	work commitment three times without
A	yeah
C	providing evidence
A	yeah
C	you know er he can only go on for
A	no
C	so long
A	trouble with oh that's good
C	yep
B	what did they send him to prison for?
C	he'd been given a suspended
A	thank you
C	sentence for whatever it was he did
B	and did he think he was going to get away with it?
C	I have a suspicion that he knew jolly well what they were
B	er huh
C	you can only
B	what was he on a?
C	turn your nose at things for so long
B	A work placement? What was that for?
C	well community it's a community order
B	oh okay
C	and you have to do work in the community
B	what in Tesco's?
C	anywhere
A	yes
B	I really wouldn't be surprised
A	mm
B	er
C	anywhere
B	the boss of Tesco's rubbing shoulders with
C	mm
B	David Cameron on one night in some
C	well
A	mm
C	I know what he'd done
A	mm
C	to the value of up to five thousand pounds
B	huh
A	oh wow
C	mm
B	blimey
A	mm
B	in
C	yeah
A	mm
C	and of course he was caught
B	mm
C	you know
B	well I wonder who was more on the take? Asda or him?
B	no honestly
C	yeah
A	oh yeah
C	it's a big con
A	they've overpriced their stuff
B	it's like yeah right
A	mm
B	there's probably percent on
A	yeah
B	but
C	it's a big con
B	it is all a big con
C	you have to er be very careful to keep your eye on the prices of the things that you use regularly
A	yeah
C	well a girl in in Morrisons yesterday was saying how much the price of cucumbers have gone up
A	yeah
C	and it'll go up more if we have drought conditions anyway
A	yeah I'm quite surprised that they haven't warned us in this area
C	mm
A	about water shortage because
C	hosepipe bans
B	is um
A	yeah
B	is it in this area as well?
A	no
B	or just in the South?
A	it's all
C	not yet
A	in the South and Southeast
B	mm
C	but it will do
A	mm
C	it will do
B	yeah
A	yes mm
B	sort all my
A	mm
B	so we're going to have to
C	really?
B	calculate
C	yeah but we can't
B	forty-two years
B	six months
C	yeah but it's difficult to to work that out
B	well it's not
C	we all use it
B	it was a fiver a week was it? Cos if
A	mm
B	I I use pretty much one of those bags
A	yeah
B	a week don't I
A	yeah
B	well my cats do
A	mm
B	and how much is one of those?
A	it's four pounds something
C	I can't remember how much the little ones are
A	no I've got the bill upstairs
C	meow
A	and said because there's only one damaged left on the counter and I wanted three or four can I take two of those at the same price as one of mine? And they did it
B	bless you
A	I've got the bill upstairs
B	but is it like four fifty? Or little bit closer to five?
A	I er er
B	you don't know
A	I can't remember
C	you don't owe me anything
B	mm
C	you paid me for the cat food
B	yeah
C	so you don't then
B	oh for the coat
A	mm
B	I haven't given you the money for the coat
C	right
A	mm
B	yeah
C	but that's all
B	I'm gonna wear it
C	you can't send it back now you've worn it
B	but I only wore it
A	I had meant to say do you want to pre-order another bag of your cat food while we're at the vets?
B	oh
A	and I forgot when we got there
C	mm
B	I should've
C	no I think you've had it too long now to return it
B	is that the twenty-eight days or something?
C	I I can't remember
B	oh well
C	mm
B	I only just hope it doesn't make me look like too much of a marshmallow when I'm wearing heels with it
C	I don't think it does at all
B	I do
A	come on Thorn
B	coming in? I do
B	shaped
C	right
B	it makes me look like a marshmallow
C	right
B	but the reason it's such a big bouffanty unshaped coat is that it's stuffed with down feathers
A	mm
B	unless she kind of gets a hoover out
C	and that really sort of defeats the object of having a down-filled coat doesn't it
A	mm
B	and deflates the
C	well
B	yes I will
A	mm
C	hopefully we won't have any more very cold weather
B	well
C	is it warmer than the two that you've been wearing?
B	it's definitely warmer
A	mm
B	definitely definitely
C	Good
B	yes
C	ooh my feet
A	for the summer when it comes
B	oh yeah
C	look just don't joke about things like that
C	just don't joke
A	well they say they really are concerned about the er the Gulf Stream
B	why?
A	changing
B	no
A	hmm
B	what about global warming?
C	well just be thankful it wasn't last winter is all I can say
B	oh gosh
A	mm
B	if that'd been
A	mm
C	Cos last winter was
B	oh
B	yes
C	mm
B	yeah
C	well it was colder than that wasn't it after Christmas
A	yes
B	and didn't it snow in November or something?
C	we had early snow
A	it started very early
C	didn't we
A	mm
C	it was horrible
A	mm
C	mm
B	yeah
A	mm
C	I reckon you
A	I've never had my boat on the water as early
C	mm
B	really?
A	mm
C	I reckon you owe us a hundred and fifty pounds for everything
C	twenty pounds a month
B	you've just put a random
C	well
B	ball-park figure on it
B	haven't you
C	twenty pounds for six months
C	simples
A	mm
B	so maybe you should've been the PE teacher er and
A	yes
B	she should've been the accountant
A	yeah
C	Don't think so
A	why? I can shout loudly
A	mm
C	no you do have to
A	mm
C	oh dear
B	um
A	I can
B	bill somewhere?
C	I can find it
A	I can access
B	okay
A	the history online anyway
B	sorry to make this complicated
A	yeah
B	no I'm just trying to find how many payments I've made
A	oh
B	to for for the fees
A	yeah
B	and how many payments they've made me for the bursary
C	mm
B	they want the bursary for January back
C	really?
B	yeah
A	in arrears or in advance
B	is that the word you use? In arrears?
A	in arrears
C	mm
A	yes
C	but they can't have it both ways
B	well the problem is it's two different departments
C	huh
B	different if they set different um tut
A	yeah
B	er guidelines
A	mm
C	mm
B	well they're just not looking at it holistically
A	mm
B	I mean they're in their complete right to set these guidelines and
C	but it seems unfair that they say we want your fees but we want your bursary back
B	yeah
C	that's not fair
B	whoever said anything was fair
C	no
C	but it's not right
A	mm
C	I would be arguing
A	mm
B	I've lived
C	that you can't have it both ways
B	I've lived
A	yes
B	through more unfair things
C	you forfeit
B	have that month that you deferred
C	oy oy oy oy
B	so I can see how the situation has arisen
A	mm
B	to see whether that February one was
C	mm
B	paid in arrears or not
C	but you need to speak to somebody
A	mm
C	as well
A	yeah
C	yes
A	talking to anybody
B	it's
C	but who did the letter come from?
B	um
A	the bursary I can understand completely
B	oh yeah
A	the fees
C	yes
A	that is mm
C	but I don't get the fees
B	no but the thing is if it wasn't the thing about they wanted the bursary back you probably wouldn't question that I had to pay fees for the month that I wasn't there but
A	mm
B	that I deferred in
C	mm
B	I can't remember when
A	mm
B	but if it if that situation was in isolation you probably wouldn't question it would you? You'd say
A	no
B	oh well yeah you were enrolled in January henceforth you should pay the fees for January
A	no I would say
B	it's just in comparison with
A	yeah
C	mm
A	continuing or not then they should make no charge for the month
B	yeah
C	mm
A	mm
B	yeah
A	yeah it it has to be put in a way that they've got discretion and they exercise the discretion
C	mm
B	but they probably don't have discretion
A	I
B	are the ones that don't
C	yeah but you need to just ask the question
A	mm
C	change their minds
A	mm
C	you might have somebody sensible and sympathetic on the other end of the phone
B	you never know
C	you never know
B	you never know
C	and Thorn's decided he likes that chair
C	mm
A	intently
B	I wish
C	silly boy
B	Barclays would just give you an online record of all the transactions you've made
C	yeah
B	my Spanish bank account
A	mm
C	it's too easy
B	but
A	yeah
B	as soon as I got back home and logged on to my bank account
A	you can see it
B	it would be there
A	yeah
C	mm
A	mm
B	now these don't even update them for two or three days
A	mm
A	on that
C	Jesus
A	yeah
C	hmm
B	really?
A	mm
C	mm
A	it could be arranged but it's for the I was glad for the opportunity to make it necessary for
C	yeah
A	because it was  it was  silly me doing some and
C	mm
A	but the big you know er things like electricity bill and builders and things like that
B	well it looks that I it looks like
A	did you not pay any by any other means at the start?
B	it doesn't look like it
A	you didn't pay on on a card?
B	well it would come up here
A	mm
B	if I had
A	well you could ask them for a detailed statement of the fees from the beginning of term
B	yep
A	so that you can reconcile it
B	actually I think they er they sent me an e-mail with the broken down sums of how much I would pay in the future
A	mm
B	to pay off the fees
C	mm
B	so maybe I should just find that
A	yeah
C	mm
B	yours I think
C	uh
B	it was like the um my Orange
A	the one?
B	the new phone
A	yeah
B	um
C	two messages
B	fifty free minutes to speak
A	mm
B	and I don't know how much information that you can download or you know
A	yeah
B	even though they say it's unlimited they do actually set a limit
A	there's a
A	there's a fair use policy
B	that's right
A	yeah
A	yes
B	not
A	yeah
C	mm
B	to see how many minutes you've got left
A	mm
B	so you never know
A	no
B	what data you
A	no
B	and it doesn't put a time
A	mm
C	dear God
A	that um the dongle I've got for using
C	mm
A	for my laptop when I'm down at the boat um I got on the screen is a bang up to date number of megabytes
B	mm
A	that I've used in today and the previous month and all told since the start
B	mhm
A	but it says mm er what I did was pay up front for a three month contract
B	right
A	and I'd been comparing what I'd been using
B	ah
A	I had set a warning
B	the first time you had like a
A	mm
B	in proportion
A	yeah
B	pro rata
A	and then suddenly I realized I could nowhere near
A	touch the capacity I
B	stop scratching
C	ay
C	just you watch it
A	but I've only got
C	cheeky monkey
A	you know I've got another month and a bit to go on it
B	why?
A	because you then go onto a pay daily or pay weekly or pay monthly contract
B	well why?
A	because it was a a three months' agreement
B	uh-huh
A	and it ends at three months
B	oh
A	yeah
B	mm
A	um
C	meow
B	hello
A	when that one is due to expire there is all I do is go back to er
B	is it Orange?
A	I can't remember
B	another phone
A	yes
B	provider?
A	yeah
B	some provider
A	T
B	T-Mobile
A	T
C	mm
A	mm
B	Will they let you get the same offer again? It's not?
A	well there's no reason why you shouldn't
B	is there nothing in the conditions that says
A	no
B	you can only
A	no
B	enjoy this offer once?
A	and Carphone Warehouse were doing that offer themselves
C	silly boy
A	on T-Mobile
B	oh Okay
A	um
C	silly boy
A	but it had just stopped with them when I
C	mm
A	and they were still doing it
C	grandma sent you a thousand dollars didn't she?
B	I don't know
C	yes
B	yeah I know but
C	she gave all her grandchildren
A	mm
C	a thousand dollars
B	so we
C	er nanny from the money for nanny to
A	Don't start complicating the issue
C	I'm just telling you what sort of exchange rate
A	yeah but that's that's
C	what are you talking about? That's just the exchange rate
B	well it's easier just to
C	fifty fifty-five pounds is eighty dollars
B	yeah but it'd be
A	no
B	easier just to put it into a calculator on the internet that just tells us how many pounds a thousand dollars is
C	excuse me
A	I I worked it all out at the time
C	no you didn't
A	I worked it all out at the time
C	give you a thousand dollars
A	no
C	I mean a hundred dollars
A	I  I don't I  don't remember how much it was but I documented it in the e-mails to
C	right
A	uh
C	wuh
B	mm
C	Don't you dare
B	I just don't know I don't uh
[ANNOTATION]	person B don't know	Entailment
B	I don't know how many payments I should expect to
A	mm
C	look at the expression on his face
A	who me?
C	no
A	no I know
C	he's looking at her very strange
B	evil stare
B	she's gone
B	yeah
C	and
B	mm
C	or hisses at him
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about payment	Entailment
B	mm
C	but Bear's terrified of him
B	aw
C	oh yes
C	because he's a wuss
A	oh he must be more than six weeks old
C	he's not
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about that how old is he	Entailment
A	surely? Really?
C	mm
A	mm
C	he's only about six weeks old
A	mm
C	that's about it
[ANNOTATION]	they are not sure about age	Neutral
B	oh maybe it was contagious
B	why my cat
C	no I don't think so
B	has had a
A	mm
B	poorly eye
C	I don't think so
[ANNOTATION]	person C is not sure	Entailment
A	just by you think she's been on Facebook together
B	yeah
B	I wish they when they gave you statements I wish they wouldn't print other things on the
A	oh er
B	back of it
A	it is it it
C	mm
B	it's
A	the
B	uh
A	decades ago they talked about computers saving paper
C	yeah
A	our electricity bills used to come on a piece of paper two-thirds the size of an A4
C	mm
B	mm
A	and you know they'd print back and front
C	with useless information
B	mm
A	and now every credit card statement I might get my average number of transactions on the credit cards is probably two or three a month
C	mm
A	it is stupid
B	ludicrous
C	crazy
A	and they're all A4 sheets now
B	yeah
A	instead of you know smaller
B	and this is thick paper too
C	mm
A	mm
B	they could at least use
A	yeah
B	recyclable paper
C	mm
B	recycled paper
C	uh
B	but what annoys me is that you can't file it properly
A	oh
B	see here for example I
A	yes
B	I've got
A	yeah
B	not all of the sides are
A	yeah
B	printed with the statement
A	yeah
C	mm
B	some of the sides are
A	mm
B	but as you said there's just so such a waste of
C	mm
B	I remember when I phoned them up because for me it's completely illogical to have a statement that starts with the least recent payment
A	the bank
C	no
A	from oldest to newest
C	yeah
A	that's been tradition
C	I would expect that
B	you see it's the opposite when you look at it online
C	Good God
B	so you get used to one way and then you see another one
C	oh
B	and my big bugbear with them
A	I've not  I've not  seen any systems that show online just the most recent
B	no
A	mm
B	that's what Barclays has on
A	mm
C	mm
B	and that's what my Spanish bank account has
C	mm
B	but also because I hadn't made any transactions in a year or I'd made less than
C	mm
B	eight in a year
A	mm
B	they sent me all of the ones for a year in no no no no wait there
B	tenth of February
A	oh right
C	helpful
A	yeah
B	and so I couldn't work out
C	mm
B	oh no that's right
A	mm
B	yeah so I had it started in March and it ended in March
A	mm
C	but which year?
B	but it didn't it wasn't clear
A	didn't
B	which
C	mm
B	year
A	which year
B	was which
A	yes
B	and I just assumed
C	yeah
B	that it was the
A	it was the same March
B	most recent
A	yeah
B	no I
A	mm
B	no I assumed no I didn't assume that it was the same March
A	oh
B	Cos there were
C	mm
A	right
B	payments in the
A	mm
B	recent
A	right
B	transaction
C	yeah
B	first
A	yeah
B	I thought six hundred quid had been taken out of my bank account that March
A	yeah
B	when I
A	mm
B	found out
A	mm
B	out of my bank account
B	and then I realized
A	mm
B	turned over the page and that there was another March at the bottom
A	yeah
C	God
B	and I said  and I said  to him look without the date without the year next
C	mm
B	to
A	mm
B	the transaction
C	yeah
B	you can understand
A	it's yeah
B	why I've
C	mm
B	had this panic
A	mm
B	not having the year next
C	oh delightful
B	and he said well you can see at the top of the bill
A	that't not
B	what about customers
A	mm
B	like me
C	mm
B	who have made so few transactions
C	mm
B	that you
C	er
B	have all the year
B	all the year on one statement
C	she'll crouch down and then she'll leap over the arm and dot him and then run away
B	yeah
B	go on  go on go on
B	get ready
[ANNOTATION]	she will run away	Neutral
B	get ready for him
A	hmm
C	oh dear
B	anyway
A	yeah
B	where my
C	mm
B	misunderstanding had
[ANNOTATION]	someone was misunderstood	Entailment
A	he was
B	occurred
C	mm
B	but he
A	one of those unhelpful ones
C	yes
A	mm
B	completely unhelpful
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	oh well no one else have ever complained
[ANNOTATION]	there were many complaints	Contradiction
A	mm
B	I don't think you should be complaining to me about that
C	idiot
B	I'm like yeah but I just
A	no no
C	put me through to your supervisor
A	no say I am registering this as a complaint
C	mm
A	and they then have to
A	he can't he it's not him that decides whether it's reasonable or not
C	no
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B will handle the complaints	Contradiction
C	he has to follow procedure
C	is this month your last payment from Spain?
B	um
C	right
[ANNOTATION]	the payment will continue	Neutral
A	and even if it was it wouldn't be
C	it wouldn't be cos it's after six o'clock
A	mm
C	oh dear
B	we said that the other day in the
C	yes
B	car didn't we
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	the payment is from Spain	Entailment
B	we said it at
A	mm
B	exactly the same moment as well
C	oh dear
A	yes
C	hasn't it
A	absolutely
A	mm
B	sorry
C	I'd just asked you if you'd had your last payment from Spain
B	mm
C	and you said yes but it wouldn't be till next month
B	yeah
C	oh dear
B	so that's
C	life gets very complicated
B	another thing to see whether I can transfer some money over from Spain
A	mm
B	I haven't kept an eye on the value of the euro
A	I haven't
B	yay
B	well done Thorn
A	you do move fast when you want to don't you Thorn
C	mm
B	he he told her
A	mm
B	Good boy  good boy
C	the one outside the Post Office
B	Good boy
C	I think was
B	Good boy
C	one twelve
B	Good boy
A	mm
B	I know
A	I er
C	but
B	to
A	yeah
B	I don't know if it's been
A	I would imagine if anything it's been relatively stable
C	mm
B	really?
A	because they've sort of agreed that support for Greece
C	mhm
A	so the the pressure on
C	yep
A	the euro has lessened a bit for the time
B	Good
A	and depressed as it was
B	mm
A	but if you want
B	well maybe I should just leave it over there
A	to check at any time O and A dot com
B	oh no I look at
A	mm
B	xE
A	oh right
B	dot com
A	mm
B	but yeah
A	mm
B	I saw in
A	sound like
B	see that doesn't sound like a bad exchange rate for buying
A	well it it it might've been
B	oh but wait wait though
A	without seeing
C	I think that's
A	the full story it's
C	them buying from you
A	no
C	I really don't know
A	I would think
C	mm
B	really?
A	yeah
B	hmm
A	mm
B	and the
A	well you
B	exchange rate that they applied was quite
A	yeah but
B	was quite decent
A	Will will they not also apply a currency charge?
B	it didn't look like they had
A	mm
B	oh right
A	so you could find that there's a charge for cash drawing
C	mm
A	of a couple of pounds each time
B	well nothing came up on the statement to that effect
A	mm
C	mm
A	yeah
C	well maybe they didn't then
B	I dunno
C	it's all too complicated for me
B	and the problem is nowadays you get the feeling that they make it complicated so
A	oh yeah
B	as to
C	oh yeah
B	pull the
A	yeah
B	wool over your
A	mm
B	eyes
C	yeah
A	yeah
B	so that you don't realize
C	mm
B	like the Orange bill the first one they sent me was on paper
C	mm
B	but they'd charged me one pound eighty to send me a paper bill
C	God
B	you have to log in to your online
C	hmm
B	account if you want to change that
A	mm
B	however they make it so difficult for you to find the little bit that says er online statements not paper statements
C	oh God
B	yep
C	which is the least expensive?
B	it's absolutely ludicrous
C	mm
B	complicated
C	which is the least expensive option?
B	well I mean er

C	I know what the answer is
B	I know
A	see I don't even need to hear the questions do I
B	so tell me
A	um
B	yeah
A	in the car
A	and in a situation like this as long as I am aware somebody is talking to me
A	I don't have a problem
A	my concern is that the hearing in that ear is so bad that it will never get to be a help
A	to some extent
C	hmm
A	oh it is
C	couldn't it
A	yeah
C	it's not like the other ear
A	not on a comparison with my left
C	no
A	no
C	mm
A	that er
C	mm
B	are there any situations in which you do find it helpful?
A	when I'm driving at about fifteen miles an hour and able to talk to your mother
A	assuming she's sitting next to me in the car
C	does help
C	does help
A	yeah but you don't have to repeat everything if you make me aware you're talking to me
C	tut huh and that's very hard work
A	but we
C	it's much easier
A	while we're sat here you haven't had to
C	yes
A	yeah
C	going

C	and it gets very wearing
A	whether you're talking to me or the cats

B	maybe you need a little traffic light or something
C	no
A	do you remember
A	if I have a shock collar on

C	you what?
B	Don't
C	that's exactly how he says it
B	yeah I'm sure he doesn't
C	he does
A	I got fed up with saying
C	that's exactly what he
A	say again? And I do say that sometimes
C	yes he does
B	say sorry?
A	because that's
B	sorry
C	no it's condensed now hopefully to say?
C	but it's the tone of voice
C	it's not what did you say? Say? It drives me round the bend

C	mm
B	so it was probably made in nineteen seventeen
C	mm
A	mm
C	well you know the history of it?
B	yeah
C	so that sounds about right
C	mm
B	Cos it
C	mm
B	when she bought it for her engagement ring it was already a second-hand ring wasn't it? When she bought it it was second-hand?
C	that I don't know
B	I think
A	that rings a bell

B	and it
C	could be
B	numerically in the years
C	well no you see it no no it was actually given to nanny no given to

B	uh-huh
C	it wasn't um that sort of era
B	what was?
C	that the girl who had it as her engagement ring was killed
B	oh
C	in a motorcycle accident
B	no cos er I had
C	with her fiancé
B	understood that nanny
B	that it had been given to nanny in the nineteen sixties
C	no
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	one would imagine that when she
A	mm
B	bought it it was already second-hand
A	yeah
C	but exactly what the journey between nanny and
B	well
C	oh no I don't think she nicked it out of nanny's jewellery box
B	borrowed it
C	I think it was
A	mm
C	er another case of
B	mhm
C	Cos I think it I don't know whether
B	excuse me
C	it might've been passed to grandma

C	no
B	well nanny told me that this was this ring was given to her by a lady with whom she worked in
C	well that's the first I've heard of it being somebody from
B	maybe because you're remembering it wrong
C	well whatever
C	mm
B	uh
C	but I thought it was much further back than that
B	in what respect?
C	that nanny got it and
C	but I thought it was much further back
