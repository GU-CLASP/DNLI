C	or Dr really
A	I had to ring the dentist to book at appointment with them
B	for you?
A	for me do you know what? I have been putting it off for ages cos I saw them I thought not that long ago and then they put a a new filling in and they said it will be fine and it isn't and I haven't been able to eat on that side of my mouth and I thought it was a few months ago but when I rang they said that it was March last year so it's a whole year ago
B	yeah
A	so you can put your fears to one side and they'll do a basic hearing test I hope and then probably they'll say to you that your hearing is fine cos that's what people said to me even though I can't really hear people
A	so
C	unless it's really bad they try and assure you that it's fine
A	well it I think there's there's obviously actual hearing problems and then there's just problems like probably you have what I have with there's lots of people in the room there's lots of background noise I can't really hear what people are saying
