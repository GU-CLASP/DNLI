C	yeah it
C	what and what about can you pick up scars if cities have the
B	recording okay alright love?
A	yeah
C	if you start a city with a faded figure? in a city with a faded figure
D	yeah
C	so if say if he's in anywhere in the Middle East
D	or it's not
C	er so yeah so you can
D	it's not just a zombie
C	but you can you can avoid the erm the cities that look like they're gonna outbreak just don't go near them but if he's in the Middle East and say I he's in Karachi there's no faded figures on there but then suddenly someone draws Karachi
D	yeah
C	then he's gotta get out of Karachi before his next go
D	yeah
C	so that might be handy to have the dispatcher to look after Ollie to get him out of cities
B	but like if he obviously
C	mm
B	but like it's not like he's out
C	so either well it's either have the dispatcher who can move him but I think
B	but then so we're worrying a lot about one
D	mm yeah and I think Jackie's more useful
C	uhu so
D	well er that's like a like an an attacking game with
B	no
D	if you
B	not just that
B	I think I think Jackie's pretty good as relationships go and her ability's pretty good and we've got the backup of doing that and there's no we can
C	and
B	and there not to be
C	yeah yeah
B	many cubes close together so that's a good backup and it's good to have Jackie for that
C	but
B	yeah the he died like a hero
D	and has a two-year-old
E	so why is he going then tell me?
B	well he's got
C	he can't take any more scars and so if he gets another one
D	yeah
C	he's gone erm
B	but hang on a second do not gain a scar when you're in a city when it outbreaks
C	but that doesn't account for scars which are counted when you're a faded figure because then it
B	so just avoid I wouldn't I wouldn't be in black anyway apart from to put one one research one
C	so
B	medical
C	so just don't go anywhere near the black
D	yeah
C	yeah
B	and I wanna avoid Asia anyway because I get one less turn if I start my turn in Asia
C	right so you're gonna be limited
B	so I can completely stay out of black anyway because Europe has already got so it's not colours Europe's already got a military base so that's fine I can go anywhere in Africa to put one down and I can go in the red part of Asia which fine I'll lose a go by staying here but I'm I don't have to even touch black
C	uhu uhu okay yeah so so we don't need the new assignment role
D	so we're going for one quiet night
C	yeah
D	erm and we've got four to choose did you want the research station the military station?
E	I thought you wanted the research one
D	well I think that it means both it I think you get to choose whether it's a military
B	but this is a military base yeah so I would say
D	oh
B	when it says research station
D	okay
B	it's a research station
E	don't you boys like the
C	oh that's a research station that's
D	okay
C	that's less than five there
C	take the last six cards of the deck for
B	forecast cards? yeah that's
C	yeah forecast is really good erm this quarantine marker on any two cities could be helpful
B	yeah cos for Jackie's B plan B
C	so
D	forecasts er initiative one quiet night
B	one quiet night
D	forecast and what one did you want?
B	two extra actions are pretty good two
C	that that could be useful if but like only if you're trying to like outbreaks
B	that could be good for
C	yeah
D	okay
C	it's not er we haven't got the medical erm the
C	there's quite a handy one where once you've cured a disease you can
C	you can right you can take five cubes that are from a connecting city
B	oh yeah?
C	that's like a mobile a mobile hospital? I don't know if that's in this one yet
D	right
C	so I think we've got a
D	I don't
B	I would guess so it's on the action
C	yeah
B	but then you'd want it
D	I would
C	cos otherwise they wouldn't
B	even if it wasn't
C	stick it on the action
E	but you
B	but even if it wasn't an action that you took if they wanted to remind
D	but as you say
C	but it it's an action to equip
D	but it says you know not an action not an action
C	oh right
D	so it's not an action to use
C	so it's not an action to use the
B	with
D	can you are you looking that up dad?
C	where are they from?
C	that's that's our house my mate's just
C	is it just outside the house?
C	why? is he checking in?
C	last time well tell him what he did
D	oh he pretended to inject my er dad with insulin while he was driving to kill him
C	fucking hell is he diabetic?
D	yeah
C	he is yeah
C	and he thought it would be a laugh
D	and he went
C	to pretend to inject you?
E	he's mental he look at him take putting the key in the front door
C	but he's taken those pictures for it though
D	yeah
C	he's got an accomplice
E	yeah
C	what a weirdo
D	it's what you do when you're retired
C	where does he live?
E	need I say
C	where does he live?
E	he
C	he lives about he lives thirty-five miles away from the house
B	is it five infection cards?
D	yeah I always play with all of them
B	er?
D	I always play with all of them yeah
B	with five?
D	mm
B	I I dunno
A	oh
B	gonna get on the
C	how does he know it?
A	no
D	can you bring my erm
C	there's a
D	Ipad up and I'll look for this
C	there's a glass of
B	yeah it's mine
C	so I don't wanna drink it cos everyone's diseased
D	well you've caught it now
C	so you're saying
D	well we're gonna get
C	no to to add
D	it looks to me
C	to equip isn't a isn't an action I can definitely confirm that spending using those cards is not an action but it might it might make sense to actually equip and it initially would be an action or it could just be like we're giving you these
D	mm
C	as we you've got one two three four five six seven eight you've got nine freebies put them on whenever you want
D	yeah
C	cos once you've stuck them on there they're stuck aren't they?
A	no in the utility room
B	oh
A	the cider?
A	oh did you? was it nicer that coffee?
D	what's the soldier's
C	so he can reuse any card that's any of these
D	mm
C	so the soldier's basically just he can it doesn't say that you can only do that once as well
E	I tell you I've got
E	no there was one it it was called AWOL was that it?
C	well I picked I've got another
C	I've got another ale as well erm I dunno what one
B	do you wanna do any of you want anything?
E	well I got ale specifically for the erm Withnail and I quote
B	did you?
E	which is what?
B	ales ales
E	yeah
B	I've just had ales
E	no
D	I've only had a few ales officer
E	I've only had a few ales officer
E	when he gets stopped in the car on the way there
B	did you know he never he's a teetotal
D	yeah
B	he's allergic to it
E	I didn't know that Bruce
B	they made him get drunk once
D	yeah it killed him I think
C	jesus
D	okay yeah
B	right it's not it's not clear
B	do you want some of the cider I got from the farm?
C	yeah I'll try some
B	yeah?
B	do you want dry or sweet?
C	I'll start on the sweet stuff
C	are we recording still? are we still getting paid for that?
B	erm I think you're not meant to acknowledge that it's in the room it's like when you've got a wolf indoors don't ever acknowledge that it's there
D	or a
C	or an elephant
B	or an elephant
C	easy tiger now
D	oh keep it calm keep it
C	cheers
D	cheers
C	to saving the world
D	to see I mean that that alone took forty-five minutes
B	did it?
D	yeah
C	yeah but
B	I really think it pays just to
D	or
C	but the
B	just two sessions
C	but but the thing is that I I I'm not up to speed I I was only
B	no
C	so that's why
B	but I
C	with the well so the roadblocks have only be bought in one
D	two two months
B	two or
D	I'd say
B	so quarantine it's basically like a minus one for the
E	uhu
B	the the disease cubes
B	is that music
D	yeah
B	I think erm
D	oh sorry okay hold on
C	I thought those birds are on that
B	but it's
C	is he gonna take pictures of sheep?
B	yeah
D	yeah
B	in compromising positions
C	well I I wanna be
B	I don't really think we can do that and that's a big thing
C	I wanna be
B	cos we could have just gone look quarantine's not working eradicate
D	there's a lot of things we could just
C	that's why I'm here that's
B	give it
D	yeah
C	I can get a I think I can get another box
D	yeah?
C	yeah first
B	they'll do
C	season
B	they'll do series two
C	yeah it's the
D	talked to a guy?
C	yeah a guy about a dog and
B	but is er
B	Cthulhu I don't what is that? is that's like what's that world from?
C	there's like a Sherlock Holmes and Cthulhu thing
B	Lovecraft no but for
C	well you can have
B	is Pandemic Cthulhu?
D	oh somebody's home
B	no no it's no it got released
D	what?
B	yeah yeah yeah
C	an expansion
B	and if the world doesn't look like the world
D	oh
B	and you know whatever what is it? it's Lovecraft isn't it?
C	yeah
B	or tentacles are coming up and what have you
D	oh right
B	do you know The Cure? not the band from the eighties Pandemic The Cure with the dice the dice game?
C	yeah er oh no I've
B	thinking of yeah
C	yeah
B	so really
C	or it's just
B	yeah
C	with the game
B	yeah it looks pretty cool
C	I but I really like it's such a it's such a fun game and this one is taking it to the extreme
B	do you think you could go back to just
C	yeah I'd play that cos you can
B	really?
C	just play that just every now and again you just like oh yeah let's just play
B	not with no expansions even?
C	oh no not with any I'd I no I'd have to have in the lab no
B	which one's that?
C	bioterrorist I'd have to have the bioterrorist one
D	not the
C	I haven't even succeeded
D	really?
C	yeah with the actual
D	not with the purple cube but with the extra sort of
C	well you have
D	the virulent strain one you know?
C	yeah the virulent strain that's the bioterrorist one
D	no no
B	no but he means it's from the box that had the bioterrorist
D	oh it's
C	oh yeah
D	in the
C	yeah yeah yeah so cos in the lab is the one with that additional curing process
B	yeah
D	yeah
C	and I didn't get my head around that granted I only played that
B	it makes it different but it is it's it is good but
C	yeah
B	it does make it a different game
C	so no I think the most accessible is
B	yeah
D	mm
B	for sure
D	yeah
C	and it just takes it up to that cos you can control how many outbreak cards you have
[ANNOTATION]	Person C think it is not that much different from other games	Neutral
B	right
C	and the the the variation on the erm epidemic cards is quite
B	yeah yeah when you get the lab working it's pretty like you'll go for what the best option is then for the board but what's the best option for your little lab to move around and that's does change things
C	right yeah cos I think the time I tried that it was over
B	yeah
C	and I was
B	yeah
C	just looking at it and thinking
B	mm
C	I don't understand
D	yeah
C	might have been
B	and also you've gotta remember then there's less cubes in those petri-dishes there to put on the
C	cos you're chucking all your things in the lab
[ANNOTATION]	Person C think he chucks all his thing in the lab	Entailment
B	and do you die out if you've got no more fallens? what do you do?
D	yeah
C	yeah
D	yeah
C	same principle right? I really wanna be gung-ho and be a soldier
D	well I've just I've just looked on on here for things and somebody er a couple of people said how good the soldier is and how they saved him so I
B	cos I think we're a bit reluctant to add new people in and it's a bit of a catch twenty-two you don't play them because they haven't got any good upgrades
D	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Person d and B were agreed that having new people is not that much easy in their group	Neutral
B	at the end with they
C	I think
D	but
[ANNOTATION]	Person D agree for having some space	Contradiction
B	it's just that's an easy win it's just an easy star
D	yeah
B	to get
C	shall I keep Ollie? cure do we keep Scully?
D	well
C	if you
D	yeah but there's nothing else
B	what's what's the bonus she's got?
C	what does she do? she has great hair
D	for an action discard a card to draw the card with the same colour when from the player
[ANNOTATION]	Person D is trying to explain the rule of the game	Neutral
C	mm that's shit
B	erm if she's got three reds and there's a red there
C	alright
B	right to eradicate the
C	it's er but I mean looking at these kind of
C	it would only be I think this soldier guy would be good combined with the
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Person B think the thing is really big for Person A	Contradiction
C	I you can get them out of the
D	mm
D	yeah
C	and then the researcher can get them out to people
B	it's a bit like Van Damme he should be Jean-Claude
C	Jean-Claude not
B	yeah
C	Johnny Cage JC there you go
B	and what about you know in memory of Brussels?
D	yeah
C	right
B	and our trip there?
C	yeah yeah
B	see there's that too
C	I thought it was a bit I thought it was a bit sketchy when we went
B	yeah
C	what what are you talking about?
D	I think it's two
B	what out of four?
C	yeah
B	I think with four players you're mm you'd be better off always
C	so you're saying if I pull over a black now
B	yeah
C	or is that
B	driving without a licence
D	I wouldn't have given you that authority
B	pull out a black from player deck
C	er
B	it's er fallen
C	but like not from yeah but not from starter
B	I would guess I would say so
D	oh no
C	erm
D	no I've well the I've done that I
C	that's pretty harsh so that means if we've got two four like
B	and remember being you
C	uhu
C	no you and you can't be anywhere near
B	mm no
C	because if you pick up another scar you're done
D	er do you wanna have a a think about as well naming the diseases? cos we haven't done that yet and there's space for disease names here
C	at what point does it say you should name them then?
D	it says like that you can do it at the start
C	uhu uhu
D	well we just forgot I just noticed it
B	yeah
D	and then er
B	what did
C	it's quite cool
D	Cortez's revenge yeah
A	Montezuma's
D	revenge for South America
B	well for the yellow
D	yeah
B	black should be something to do with the zombies shouldn't it?
C	yeah erm
D	a zed there is is that?
C	the virus
D	the virus
C	yeah
B	virus brackets zed
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about virus	Entailment
C	zed
D	er okay we've got blue
C	capitalism can be
C	you know
B	greed
C	yeah
D	greed
C	greed has taken hold
D	greed is North America
C	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	person B is talking about football	Contradiction
B	greed is very cool and then red
C	swine no the bird flu isn't it they've avian bird flu
B	or avian swine flu a dreadful combination of the two worst elements
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about school	Contradiction
D	so much greater with the
C	what's the one er what's the one that gets Matt Damon in er
D	in Contagion?
C	yeah no wait is it Contagion? or my
D	yeah
C	it's where Gwyneth Paltrow dies Gwyneth Paltrow's revenge
B	the bottle of Britain
C	mm
B	never had it before actually
C	have you not?
B	won't buy anything with the Union Jack on
C	did I buy that?
[ANNOTATION]	person C is not sure that buy it or not	Neutral
B	no I just
C	oh right yeah it's erm
B	Kentish
C	it's a good it's a good session
B	yeah
D	is it session ale?
C	Bristol Beer no four point five is probably not but I guess then about
B	top end innit top end
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about session	Neutral
C	yeah you want a you want a
D	to keep it session
C	yeah
D	yeah
C	erm
D	he
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about that keep session	Neutral
C	I went to the Bristol Beer festival
B	oh yeah?
C	a couple well
B	oh
C	a couple of weeks ago wait what's the date today?
B	don't know
C	twenty-third?
B	yeah
C	two weeks ago twenty er like the twelfth or something eleventh yeah
D	does it matter?
C	no
C	just trying to correlate time
D	keep it accurate
C	yeah and it was yeah bloody good a lot of
D	yeah?
C	yeah it's such good value
B	do you get a do you pay and get your glass but you can keep the pint glass?
C	you they don't have pint glasses now and
B	oh
C	two years now they've gone down to half glasses
B	why? too much lewd behaviour
C	er because when you go in to get your your ales you you either buy a third or a half you don't
B	right cos you're tasting them
C	yeah so you
B	you're allowed to swallow though aren't you?
B	yeah
C	but now they've gone down to the half pints
B	yeah
C	so you just get a third or a half and normally you're drinking thirds
B	really?
D	really?
C	yeah so you pay ten pound for a for a ticket
D	yeah
C	and then when you turn up you get five pounds worth of vouchers
B	yeah
D	oh so
C	and a glass
B	yeah yeah yeah it's not bad
C	so you basically it's free entry
B	yeah
C	no no you don't
B	oh well
C	queue at all to get served
B	really?
D	the only thing I I would find it difficult I guess you know a pint is a good unit of measurement of what you're drinking
B	yeah
D	if if if there was a
C	uhu
D	I would
D	just one or one erm
C	just gotta come in threes yeah
C	but erm you yeah this and it's fair enough but you're you're actually cos you're sat around a table the only thing you need to do is get there early enough to get a table so your doors are at six thirty you wanna be queuing at like five forty-five
B	really?
C	so you can get a table
B	did you make take a notebook?
D	can you find me a pen please dad?
C	you get you get given a guide
B	do you?
C	and then there's a there's a
B	comment section
C	there's a description
B	notes
C	and then you get a little box this size to write your score in it
B	yeah but not write like a
C	and then well you write
B	poetic description
C	you write
E	it did work some of them don't work
B	yeah yeah
C	on and around
B	yeah
C	and then er it's quite funny reading it back to see how progressively you get drunk more drunk
D	is it virus zed or zed virus?
C	virus brackets zed
B	I
D	yeah
C	erm well yeah you it's it's funny you just you do get tanked cos it starts
B	yeah I bet
C	at six and it ends at eleven
B	yeah
D	well we'll each take turns writing them
E	have you got
E	Montezuma's
D	yeah
B	which is pretty good
E	yeah very good actually a man flu
B	there's a video game on the Atari called Montezuma's Revenge
E	have you seen Mephisto? a really interesting film made by erm who was the mentalist who started on on Jews and all that? and got
B	Gibson
E	genuinely it
B	not Apocalypto?
D	Mephisto
B	well yeah Apocalypto's
D	that's a great film
B	it's very good yeah amazing film
E	it is a great film yeah
B	it's in a language spoken by about twenty people in the world or something isn't it?
E	what's
C	are you playing er
D	well these this character in erm
B	basically a precursor to Indiana Jones
D	you know the
D	Faust isn't he?
E	oh yeah
E	yes no isn't it a good film genuinely though
D	yeah it's amazing
B	mm mm
C	you know the spelling right?
D	Montezuma
C	the
B	the
D	the
C	mountain
D	not saying that
C	mountain Jew
C	this is quite nice this er sweet one
B	mm but the dry oh no that's the
E	have you had the strawberry one?
D	oh yeah the strawberry's nice
C	but that's er that's really quite mild
A	you can try the strawberry one
C	thank you
D	yeah I mean this is like
C	yeah I I want to bring Jean-Claude Van Damme to the party
D	alright if you wanna do that I'll I'll be Jackie Brown
C	instead of
D	yeah
C	she's too good
B	I don't think she is
D	I don't think she's that powerful
B	I don't think she's that good
D	well look how powerful Jackie is right? she can do this the quarantine thing she's got the relationships and she's got
B	two relationships with two
C	yeah so I think maybe coming in bringing levelling up the soldier straight away and turning him into a super soldier get him now in June by December
C	he could be the he could be
B	or some sort of special soldier
C	check this out so he comes into the game with Jean-Claude Van Damme in June by December he's the universal soldier
D	are you just gonna have
C	the unstoppable machine
B	do you have another pen?
C	and he can hang around in erm the Middle East like a good soldier without picking up scars
E	you call him er Svejk the
E	there's a a great er book called The Good Soldier Švejk
D	oh
C	but
C	but then we are
C	we are cos we don't have basically the the
D	no no mm?
C	you don't have to cure the virus
B	you can't cure it you can't cure
C	so you can't cure it so you're only trying to cure three
D	yeah
B	but it does help with the elimination
D	okay dad?
E	you don't you don't like man flu do you?
D	for for red?
E	too lighthearted
D	what were we gonna er we haven't decided on a
C	well we were talking of
B	avian swine?
C	avian swine
D	avian
C	avian swine flu so
B	it's their biggest fear
C	or alcoholism
B	have we decided if you get a black in your hand whether it's counts?
C	I don't think from the start I think that's harsh
B	that's handy isn't it?
C	I haven't checked but I'm guessing
D	yeah I've got I got a black
C	yeah
D	I got
B	well you want blacks then don't you?
E	avian swine flu
C	AKA man flu
E	yeah
C	man bird man bird big
B	man bird pig flu
B	okay dad why don't you tell
C	oh yeah what's his credentials?
E	once per turn I can treat disease in any city that's connected to my city
C	nice
B	or reach
D	that's pretty good isn't it?
C	go go gadget
E	and this one called pilot is I don't have to discard a card when I'm taking a direct flight to a particular city
C	do you just fly anywhere?
B	yeah he's
C	super medic
E	so I show the card and then
C	to so that so
E	you need to have it but yeah sorry yeah
C	but you don't but you can keep it wow
E	and then you return it to
C	yeah yeah
D	yeah because
C	I think bringing him to the party
B	Jean-Claude and are you going the scientist or Jackie?
D	no I'll go Jackie
B	back in your box
D	in the in the lab in the lab box
B	have you got a
C	I have there's one here as well
D	okay guys do you wanna shuffle those?
B	yeah
D	and
B	so you do you get a scar if you're in a city when the fallen come?
C	yeah
E	yeah
D	yes
B	that's the only way I can die then?
C	yeah that's that was the concern
E	why's that the only way you can die?
B	because I've got if I get another scar I'm dead but I've got a bumper that says I don't any scar if it's an inner city when it when it
D	yeah
B	or is it when it or
D	oh
C	no but if you start yeah cos like if if you begin your turn in a city with faded figures so it sounds like
B	and they get to
C	then you turn then you start your turn so it's like the first thing that happens is you get a scar I I'd just like maybe some clarity on that but
B	right I'm just gonna try and not go there really isn't it? and then Jakarta's on five right? so that means discard one more card two
C	two
B	in total of the city's
C	city's colour
B	colour
C	to drive
B	so basically
C	don't go anywhere near that
B	you won't go to Jakarta
C	that's fair
B	you've gotta discard two reds to get in there
C	and then what about getting out? you can get out fine right?
B	yeah cos there's into there
C	uhu
B	so then we haven't got I don't think we've got any fours have we? we've got two threes
C	uhu mm
B	so that's just rioting no direct flights or charter flights in or out but you can
C	uhu
B	no new research stations to be built
C	yeah
B	it would make er thematic sense
C	yeah
B	dad what colour are you?
E	in the past I've been
B	blue
E	I've
B	okay yeah well you've got the blue then and
D	uhu
B	okay
C	right what what
B	who's got the biggest city?
C	I've er drawn a
C	drawn a forecast card
B	right
C	that's nice
E	oh there you go there you go then
C	erm
B	we've gotta infect your board as well
C	I've got Lagos which is pretty big
B	I've got Manila and São Paulo
C	I'd say São Paulo was bigger
B	twenty mil
C	yeah
B	Manila twenty point seven
E	I've only got San Fran and Riyadh
B	okay
C	I'm hoping Jean-Claude doesn't fail us
E	I think I had I hadn't realised that the scared ones go I think it's possible that those two could go today
B	this would only be if I was in a
C	right oh shall we see what he's got or?
E	my friend who was down there just said hey you've got good neighbours the guy opposite me er asked me what I was doing taking photos I told him I was from a letting agency looking to place immigrants throughout the area
E	he closed his door
D	oh my god
C	uhu erm so with the fallen figures
B	mm
C	they add scars immediately
B	if you're in there
C	mm
B	but again cos Jackie Brown can do it remotely
C	mm
B	there's no need for her to go in there
C	uhu the so this soldier can run around in there?
B	yeah
C	so he's
B	so you're alright in there but
C	yeah
B	yeah but also you can't cure it anyway so
D	get infected
C	yeah I forgot that he can't discover a cure but
B	yeah but there's other people for that
B	okay
C	okay what have you got?
B	we
C	Jackie
B	okay
C	and what's that one?
D	er and I can remove one disease cube at anywhere on the board at any time
C	and then you've just got that card yeah?
D	er no it's just erm an
B	you'll have it but if you
D	yeah
B	if he plays it without using it then
C	yeah
B	obviously would okay then infecting then dad
D	I've forgotten do we want fallen to be
C	so already Bangkok's on a three so if it goes up again then it's collapsing
B	yeah
D	okay
E	so do we put a roadblock on that if we can?
D	yeah we yeah
B	how many people in Istanbul
D	thirteen million
B	Manila
B	okay two
C	man
B	Essen
D	alright then
C	so also because you're in a medical a research centre
B	are we saying that's an action? or not?
D	not an action to use an action to pick it up
C	an action to to take it and just stick it on a card I think that's gotta be an action if you're taking some and putting it on a card
D	yeah no but to use it isn't
C	an action no but to actually equip it
D	okay
C	cos initially it it's an equipping equipping it is the action isn't it?
D	yeah okay
B	so
C	so you can either take the card can be used as a city card of any colour
B	I won't take that because I can do that if I'm in a research station anyway
C	uhu cool
B	right anything else?
C	er a hazmat discard this card when you're starting your turn in a city containing faded figures so that's the that's
B	I'm not gonna be there anyway
C	but
D	yeah
C	but yeah that would be a good that would give
B	that will block me
C	give give him give him a hazmat and then he's safe
B	okay then he's
C	but
B	definitely safe
C	yeah
B	and then field hospital
C	field hostel discard to add a research station to your city regardless of the panic level
B	so I leave that because I'm military based
C	yeah
B	shall I take a hazmat suit? cos there's more of them as well now
C	mm
D	is it your go first then is it?
B	yeah
C	mm
B	and I've got five actions anyway
D	well yeah don't and don't forget you erm you wanna be building one right?
B	this turn yeah
D	yeah
B	maybe even in
C	so I think yeah take a hazmat suit put it on er
B	but hang on no if I put that on a city then I've gotta keep that city card with me
C	no cos I can take it back but
B	yeah but then you're using it but anyway I've only got this as long as I've got a city card
C	yeah yeah
D	uhu
B	okay well I might keep Manila I might use Manila cos erm I I'm thinking of going there so shall I just keep São Paulo then?
D	okay
B	put it on São Paulo
D	uhu
E	and that's good for now but in the next game
C	it it sticks with it it stays with it
D	yeah
C	yeah
E	that's what I'm saying but it could be it could be good for us it makes that a good card
D	yeah
C	yeah
E	it makes that a much better card than
B	okay so one I've got five actions I can look at the top two infection cards
C	you can do that every go can't you?
B	yeah Jakarta New York one
D	yeah I mean
B	yeah okay so I've got four actions shall I build a military base there? cos then that's North America sorted
D	yeah
C	green?
B	two and I would say fly to here and I could maybe sort out
D	or you could leave
B	I
D	and then get out
B	get out of Asia
D	okay
B	one two
C	that's three actually
B	so this'll be three won't it?
C	that'll be four
B	no so hazmat one
D	that doesn't count as an action looking
B	two
C	oh it doesn't count as an action?
D	no
C	oh wow
B	three
C	yeah
B	build and then go to Manila
C	okay
B	four
C	well maybe don't go to Manila in case there's a problem for some reason
D	well er he's
B	I am safe so
C	okay
B	er if I
C	okay
B	go to
C	skip between them?
B	what do you think?
D	I mean why are you going to Manila?
B	cos I've gotta get out of Asia otherwise I lose a turn
D	okay yeah yeah yeah you yeah stay there cos
B	okay alright then
D	and you've got a hazard suit
C	Ho Chi Minh er so you could go zip over and come back quicker
B	yeah okay okay
C	er the card first right?
B	is that right yeah
C	yeah
C	wow
B	treal
C	he was in Delhi wasn't he?
B	yeah
E	yeah
B	Ho Chi Minh okey-doke
C	uhu
B	infect two
C	mm
B	Jakarta New York
E	so Jakarta's out there anyway
D	yeah so we'll er
C	you built a military base so that means we can pick up a grenade belt which
D	well yeah yeah
C	er discard at any time to remove one faded figure from the city you're in
B	you and you're gonna be in faded zones where mm no one else really is gonna be in there
C	uhu and
D	it's a really good one isn't it?
C	that one yeah
D	yeah
C	so you can use just
D	that you can't do that but
C	no no
D	I can
C	er drone escort so discard this card when you drive into a collapsing or fallen city
D	so the only
C	uhu
D	is on five but erm
C	uhu erm
B	you can get in there for free basically it's saying
D	yeah
C	yeah
B	so
D	so we haven't got any four we haven't got any fours
C	we don't need the so we don't need those just now
B	no
C	so don't don't equip anything for now
D	but when didn't you want a grenade belt?
C	yeah that might be fun
E	what does that do?
C	you can erm remove er one faded figure
D	one fallen one
C	one faded fallen figure as a and then you discard the card so it's like you just drop a grenade in the city
E	oh good
B	Jean-Claude will that like that won't he?
C	yeah
B	so that's one
C	so Lagos is now a grenade city
D	uhu
C	erm
E	and after we've finished putting these on
D	have you got two
E	wouldn't that make the next game sort of a lot easier but I guess there's other things that
C	yeah yeah
B	yeah games getting yeah
C	so does anybody want erm take a can I give
D	no
C	move from a city with a military base to another military base
B	so Hong Kong or Paris
C	so I'll go to Paris
B	two
C	two three and
E	leave that one on here
B	or put a quarantine on it so that
B	yep so that's so your medical and the and the rest of us are military
E	oh yeah
D	mm er well yeah you can yeah you can put a quarantine on it er you can roadblock it erm
B	quarantine helps with that objective
D	yeah
C	yeah
D	you
C	do you
D	or you can sort out Essen
C	and do I need to be in in that city to quarantine it?
D	yeah
B	yeah
C	right
D	another thing we didn't know when when this infects Madrid
B	yeah
D	when Madrid comes up if it comes up
C	it gets one of each
D	er no instead of blues coming it's just more
B	right are you gonna so
C	as one's blue so one's
B	so roadblock the roadblock around Algiers isn't bad thing cos it protects Madrid but then a quarantine is part of that objective
D	yeah
C	cos the quarantine gives that an extra life
B	mm
D	yeah
C	erm
B	and it gives us one out of seven
C	yeah er
C	but a roadblock would
B	but
C	three four
B	but if you've got a quarantine it's not gonna have an outbreak to
C	mm
B	Madrid anyway
C	yeah but I need to be in it in order to deliver
D	well it well the thing is right the the difference between them is quarantine is temporary
B	yeah
D	okay? quarantine takes the big hit
B	I know the yeah
D	but but the roadblock is is
B	and actually
B	that's stopping Algiers really more or less will stop you going into Europe stop the faded going into Europe
C	uhu
D	yeah
C	so does a roadblock is consistent? it doesn't get back
B	a roadblock stays
C	uhu
B	but as say er is
C	uhu
B	you know it's
C	so a roadblock
B	it counts as not as not
C	it can't
B	doing it with the quarantine
C	can't be broken
B	but
C	so if Algiers was to outbreak
D	mm
C	and it tried to go to a roadblock
D	it doesn't
C	would it break down the roadblock?
B	no no the roadblock stays
C	well let's go roadblock on this
B	but then you're not you're not getting one of your
D	well yeah okay but you know I've got my ability
C	does it matter what colour they are? black or
B	oh hang on
D	and you put it you put it put it in the middle
E	and it stays in the middle I think
B	so you've gotta go there and you've got that that that and that
D	and I think
C	and on my next go I can put a quarantine on
B	and you could discard Lagos now if you wanted and take one guy off anyway
C	mm oh I could save that for next go and take
B	and it's not yeah
C	all three
D	yeah yeah you
B	it's not an action either
D	yeah
B	yeah
C	mm do I need Lagos?
D	no keep it for the moment you dunno how things are going
C	okay so that's my five right?
unknown_female	is there any reason why these are two different colours?
C	five four sorry
unknown_female	they're just blue and black
D	no
C	right okay so Atlanta and one quiet night
C	yeah
B	at the top so that's why you either need the quarantine roadblock or whatever you can't leave something on three so now okay actually they're fine because they're not black a black three is always dangerous and
C	so because Algiers could no no cos you said if Algiers come up from here it doesn't go to an outbreak
B	it won't trigger an outbreak
C	it won't trigger
B	actually yeah
D	doesn't trigger
C	right infect
B	okay two Lagos
C	is that er black
C	yeah
D	you've not put
C	well I didn't like em
B	right okay
C	so you can quarantine from afar right?
D	I can quarantine from afar so I'm probably gonna go Delhi
C	right
C	right what if you're connected to it?
D	and I can share knowledge with Rachel
C	who's not here
D	and
C	you've
C	mm
D	but that's no good
C	cos he's yeah you've left the city
unknown_female	yeah
D	okay so I've got
C	so you've got an additional move
B	can just do it now
D	yeah go on then
B	so no I've got two extra moves
D	oh yeah
B	so
D	and
B	that one one no Manila's safe I could build even a research station now in in Manila
C	it is
C	I think you can only do that once per turn though
B	no that's once per turn move from any city
C	so you can only er it is an action to build?
B	it's not it's as an action but I don't need the city card
C	yeah
B	sorry
C	so you can
B	so
C	so building is an action
B	that's ignore all that
C	yeah cool cool
D	okay so I've got three moves left erm what what are we thinking? looking at eradicating blue? er greed? to keep an eye on it
B	it's not close to being cured though either is it?
D	no but I mean just keep on top of it right I mean
C	mm mm mm yeah I mean
B	because Algiers can come out is it worth putting a quarantine on Algiers cos it can come out from there?
C	it er that it wouldn't go to an outbreak if it came out from there
C	yeah
D	yeah I
C	do you wanna pick up any er a drone?
B	oh okay
C	unless you want a grenade belt
D	oh shall I
C	no cos you need to be a
D	no you need to be at a medical station
B	no I think it's
D	oh okay it's only medical people
C	yeah out of
B	oh no if you look at the actions though it just says
D	yeah it says add a medical equipment sticker if you're at a research station you don't have to be
C	oh no you're right yeah
B	yeah because I took a hazmat suit and I'm
C	yeah
D	yeah
C	but you still need to be either yeah got it that's cool
B	okay
D	so one two
C	four
D	four
D	I'll you know I'll yeah I'll move over there and see
C	and I'm in there as well so I can do it
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	mm
D	see
E	yeah we want to er do we want to eradicate blue? that's
D	well that's I'm
B	okay yeah
D	one
C	Mumbai
D	okay so now Mumbai gets hit
B	yeah and infect São Paulo
D	okay there you go
D	mm
E	are the reds?
D	yeah
C	how much of a benefit do we get from eradicating
D	well I can do that sort of on my on my sort of next go and
B	can you block things going into your city?
C	if yeah if she's
D	no oh no only if I'm er got my quarantine it's not like oh it's not all Jackie Brown
C	oh it's not all Jackie Brown
D	no
C	it's like Jackie Brown mark two
E	then what do you say then?
B	but these one two three
C	mm that's
D	er well no cos dad dad's got the remote thing right?
B	one two three
D	you can only really use the remote thing once
E	you can only use the remote things once
D	mm
E	and they treat disease in the city connected to your city
B	one two three
D	four
C	four and that's from the
E	cos the medic
C	cures one cures cures all yeah that that
D	yeah
C	uhu
B	uhu
E	and then three
D	mm
B	no you
E	you can't go move to it
C	yeah
E	three
C	yeah
E	four
C	that's
B	that's very powerful
D	very good
E	right
C	wow
E	that's alright
D	er try that Yarlington really nice
E	uhu
C	and I wanna get what you got
E	I've got one more
D	hay fever gardening
B	hang on a sec
C	is that is are you are you serious?
D	no I think I'm
B	so remember you can fly directly to any city in the
E	if I had the card
B	no if you've got any if you've got the card you
B	you can fly there and you don't discard it like you would have to do
C	that's that's nice
E	but you've got to have the card
B	yeah
E	to do it and fly to any city
C	that is nice
B	yeah
E	yeah okay so I've taken four
B	yeah you've got a really good card there
C	mm
E	so is there one more or is that it?
B	no that's it
C	no four yeah
B	it's four actions each so then you'd take two
C	oh we we
B	woo woo
B	alright so three goes to
B	we don't want a black
D	mm
B	that's Moscow did not want that
B	I wanna see and Moscow comes out
D	yeah
B	have you got things to we could look at the six
D	I I can I can remove a disease cube anywhere on the board right now
B	I would say is that a disease cube?
D	yeah yeah
C	oh
B	is it though?
D	yes
C	yeah I think they're I think they are classed as disease as disease cubes
B	I suppose they wouldn't wanna spoil it and put
D	yeah
B	brackets
C	yeah
B	cos
B	do you have to discard Istanbul for that?
C	yeah
B	yeah but I'm not chasing
C	you can't cure that anyway
B	no I'm just saying
D	oh no I don't have to discard it no
B	but it that's
D	yeah
C	I are you sure? cos it's like an event card
D	yeah no it's an upgrade where if you win a game you've got these upgrades erm
C	but it what it just gives you bonus event cards?
D	well you choose yeah where's the
C	but I I'm pretty sure you'd have to discard it to use it
D	we can have a look
C	so so you've shuffled it
B	do you wanna take your
E	there's a
B	second card?
E	another epidemic
B	yep
E	Moscow
C	doesn't affect it cos it's already got three and it can't outbreak
B	did
D	no
C	no
B	but you were going to weren't you?
D	well no I was looking if I could
B	but you can use it anyway it's just whether you discard it or not
D	er yeah
C	but if you draw from the player this card pile it can't
D	it
C	create an outbreak
D	yeah
C	it can only put it to the
B	so what does it do?
D	it just
C	nothing
E	no it just
B	so we want that to happen in a way
D	yeah
C	yeah so that's great
E	yeah
C	that's the best time to draw Moscow
E	and where does this
B	this is yours
C	so you keep it in your deck you keep it in your hand
E	oh okay
D	yeah
B	and remember you can fly there now as well
E	so I can fly there now and do routes yeah
B	and take three off with one action
E	yes I could do that next time
C	erm but now er
B	infect two
E	you get er two
C	yeah
B	no?
C	yeah
B	so that infects two then
E	Tokyo
