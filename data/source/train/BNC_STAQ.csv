B	didn't fully understand so all I know is that it's some way of your body keeping you healthy cos something about filling up the tissue with new blood and stuff
A	yeah
B	it helps it stay healthy and it stops you from getting erectile dysfunction
A	well they get like seven or eight
B	yeah it's something ridiculous like
A	it's it's not just in the morning
B	yeah it is
A	does that make
B	they've got more desire for yeah like oh sometimes when
A	yeah
B	but erm
A	well
B	yeah
A	like isn't my ex-boyfriend were huge like
B	I don't like that
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A has been into a relationship in the past.	Entailment
A	ridiculously big
B	no
B	oh
A	like he thought it like cos he said he's obviously seen other boys' penises when they've been in showers and that and his just seemed small I comparison
B	oh but to be completely honest I'd rather have a guy with a slightly smaller than average penis than a slightly bigger because can you imagine? A it's painful
A	well
B	B it stretches you out
A	yeah
B	and you can't really do the same stuff like
A	well
B	get in places
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B prefers big penises.	Contradiction
A	yeah
B	that a bigger penis couldn't
A	yeah well the he isn't small
B	oh bless him
A	and then after that I just used to take piss out of him like ha ha small dick
A	and he he got over it straight away
B	ah
A	like
B	that's good
A	but I I think that is the way to deal with it like if you've got an insecurity about yourself take the piss out of it like that's why I take the piss out of my manly voice and like my big nose like when that fly landed on it like
B	that's what I do with my forehead
A	do you know what I mean?
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A made fun of small penises.	Entailment
B	making jokes about flying to China
A	yeah
B	I mean it's hurtful when other people do it
A	well if they did it viciously
B	but I do it myself it's like even when people do it as a joke I still find it helpful cos I'm like I'm the only person that can laugh about that you're not allowed to
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A likes to make fun of his/her insecurities.	Entailment
A	I'm allowed cos I'm your best friend I've got a
B	mm
A	I don't have a receiving hairline either my hairline keeps getting
B	mine's going the other way
B	soon I'll be bald I'll just have a little ponytail like a Chinese person
B	mm
A	everyone people say to me oh you should do blah-blah and like yeah maybe I am but it's a personal thing and
[ANNOTATION]	Most Chinese people have ponytails.	Neutral
B	mm
A	my way of dealing with it is taking the piss out of it
B	it's like people who you look at and you think are absolutely perfect they still have insecurities
A	mm
B	and just cos you don't see them doesn't mean they're not there
A	no
B	but she is
A	I would never tell her she has an amazing body either
B	she wouldn't even accept it
A	I know she wouldn't
B	I've tried several times I've just been like do you know how beautiful you are and she's literally just like shut up and she gets quite vicious about it
A	mm
B	mm
A	like I actually genuinely like her
B	she's calmed calmed down I think
A	yeah she's grown up a lot hasn't she? like matured so much cos obviously she had that job didn't she so
B	yeah so I think what with getting the job and sort of kind of moving out of her family home
A	yeah
B	I don't know like she's going to England
A	yeah
B	so we're not doing much because she could still
A	she could still come like
B	just shall I send her a message and see if she wants to come over and watch a film or something?
A	yeah definitely like I like but I like well not but
B	no she's
A	not that she was were a dickhead before but she were just annoying like cos she was just so immature but like she has really calmed down and I actually really like her
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	but also I sort of put her off a bit by saying just wait until next year it'll be better cos I
A	yeah
B	so well now you understand why I didn't invite you or anyone sooner sort of thing
A	yeah
B	but plus it's gonna be amazing if someone does come over because the room's gonna be slightly bigger
A	yeah and there's always there's room on the floor for them to sleep room in the living room
B	exactly and it's just
A	room in my bedroom
B	it's gonna be so much nicer to be able to be in an environment where everyone's nice and friendly
A	mm
B	and
A	it's not hostile
B	mm
A	it's not a hostile environment
B	cos it was nice when
A	yeah
B	just got annoying
A	that's why I'm
B	do you want your last little cig?
A	no I've saved it for you
B	thank you
A	erm
B	mm
A	cos like
B	yeah
A	and it weren't like I were at home when I could go out shopping for day or go to see one of my friends
B	yeah
A	we were constantly together and like I loved every minute in New
B	America
A	but like it were just and then when we got back it were the same on top of each other and it were just it's just nice to get away
B	yeah
A	like
B	that's why this summer I've loved being with
A	yeah rugby
B	goes for rugby training and stuff
A	yeah
B	like having that little break is nice like the other day when I got pissed off with him he came back that night it was absolutely fine
A	yeah
B	cos I know that he just needed that little bit of space to cool off I needed that little bit of space to not keep being pissed off at him
A	yeah
B	and then it's fine
A	yeah cos er I mean
B	mm
A	like normal like little things you deal with pissing me off like one he were coming
B	but there are though there are little things that annoy you that it it happens to me and I get annoyed and I'm just like why am I angry?
A	yeah
B	there's no reason to be angry and it is just because you've just been around for too long I think
A	yeah
B	oh there's two lizards on the wall down by the pool house
A	oh yeah
B	on the on the crack in by the ceiling they're so cute I love them
A	they go so move so fast don't they?
B	mm
A	oh
B	and it ran away but well lizards like the
A	yeah they can yeah
B	so like I always knew about their tails but their legs as well
A	yeah they can grow anything yeah
B	they can regrow legs which is so cool
A	it must be so painful though
B	yeah but can you imagine like oh no I lost an arm okay give it a week I'll have another one
B	but I would really really really hate to lose a limb
A	oh yeah me too
B	in an accident or something I would fucking hate that
A	my worse fear is being paralysed or being or having dementia or something being stuck in my own body
B	trapped in your own body
A	I'm terrified of that
B	it's awful like that ALS challenge
A	yeah
B	for those people that was awful cos they lose the
A	they lose everything
B	can't seem to even talk
A	they lose everything like they're just trapped in their own body like if I ever got like that I would want someone to kill me
B	mm
A	I would want someone just to end it all because that is not a life that's an existence
B	I reckon if I was like paraplegic it would be hard but it would be liveable because you'd still be mobile in the top
A	yeah
B	and they say that sometimes when you're paraplegic you still have feeling down there so you can so could have like sex and stuff
A	yeah
B	which is nice
B	it's just so emasculating
B	yeah like I said earlier my worst nightmare is being
[ANNOTATION]	person B had a worst nightmare	Neutral
A	mm
B	people thinking I'm crazy when I'm not
A	mm
B	like being kept there against your will
A	yeah
B	I would fucking hate that or like if something genuinely did happen and no-one believed you and they just thought that you were crazy
[ANNOTATION]	people thinking the person B is crazy	Entailment
A	yeah like in
B	yeah
A	like them books I'm reading now
B	like in erm the second series of American Horror Story

B	oh that's lovely
A	it were like fifty quid or something
B	that's great
A	like I don't know what to say to them like I don't like asking
B	don't it doesn't help
[ANNOTATION]	person B say it is not help	Entailment
A	cos it doesn't help at all does it? but like I just wanna always ask that are you alright how are you coping? it's like they
