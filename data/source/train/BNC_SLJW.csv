C	ah
A	ah
C	plus
A	we're on eight now

D	we're on point one
A	we're probably towards the end of
D	we're on point one so far
A	oh did you press the mileometer? we're on nought point two
C	I dunno I'd say one yeah
A	you said one I'm going two kilometres
B	are you saying kilometres or miles

A	one I'm two
B	I'd say a mile
D	two and half
A	you say a mile? dad says two and a half kilometres I say two kilometres
B	how does that compare to miles
D	I can't remember exactly
C	er excuse me I was also
A	purely from our brains
B	you and you were
C	it's gotta be one I'm telling
A	it's not gonna be one
D	we're
C	yeah we're nearly there
A	no we're not
A	I think I'm gonna be bang on
C	fine one point five

C	one point five
A	you're not

D	well
C	well what
B	and then I want to convert it
