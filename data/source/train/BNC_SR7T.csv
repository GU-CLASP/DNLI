unknown_female	yeah it was just
unknown_female	oh look
D	do you fancy coming to this? I was like yeah
D	but dad was was saying oh let's ask
E	it was we were all
C	mm
unknown_female	mm
C	then just about two days before
unknown_female	mm
C	one of them said why don't we put it on Facebook? so when we were going in it they were saying how did you find out about this event? it was Facebook and they said there were more people there
A	because of that?
C	because of Facebook and there wasn't anybody there because of all our fliers
A	never
C	and they said they'd spent ages going on putting the flyers in
D	yeah
C	nobody had come as a response to the flyers
D	yeah one of the main ladies who organised it
D	you know that a lot of the advertising up until
C	now
A	it is a shame
D	people don't read and I said to
D	I always look if I'm in
D	and when I worked at the bookshop people don't obviously work in a bookshop you think people read but they don't see
C	no
D	the number of people who'd come in and say where's your café?
C	yeah
D	or where's your fiction books? or where something that's right in front of you
B	look at the signs
C	mm
D	or you know
A	it's like parents at school we sent
C	yeah
A	two newsletters even a text and loads of information about a reading morning we had and the parents still turn up and say when's the reading morning? oh is it today? well we didn't know
C	yeah
A	we'd've got the morning off school
C	yeah
A	so we've had two newsletters
C	yeah
A	they said oh
D	but when you're out and about a notice like that I said to mam I am quite I know I make a point of reading
A	mm
D	but I know from working in shops that people don't
A	they won't no they don't
D	they
D	even when I'd like to do it and look it is hard sometimes and if I've
A	yeah
D	it's like several steps not on Facebook
B	but when you're on the internet you're in that mode where you can
E	yeah
B	take in
D	mam opened it
A	mm
A	ah right
A	you can't think well is it good? or not?
E	mm
B	could you?
C	so straightaway I contacted them I was like can I book three tickets and er the answer's back yes you you're booked and it was that simple
A	ah yeah it's instant
D	well you reserved them didn't you? you didn't pay there and then but
C	mm
E	no
C	no
D	you know when you're out you can't
D	you might think oh it might be good but it's it's a lot of trouble almost
A	yeah
D	or put it in your phone
A	yeah
D	and then when you get home you've got to do another step by looking him up
A	that's very true
D	whereas when you're on Facebook
D	have a look google it and then
A	and all the distractions in between the beginning and the end of the process
A	yeah
C	he's started advertising on Facebook
A	yeah
C	er and so er the he advertises you know anybody want a family pack? and this is what's in the family pack so it's so easy to just go on there and say can I book my next family pack for Saturday morning please?
[ANNOTATION]	Person C agree with Person f in what changes he want to do	Contradiction
D	yeah
A	yeah that's how people are communicating
D	and you
D	but you said didn't you? the first time you went in
C	mm
D	and he said eh well er you know he'd sort of had it as his little idea and I think some of them had been like oh I don't know
C	they'd had a hundred orders
D	yeah
C	from Facebook in like a week
A	from
C	in the weekend
D	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Person D could not find something that put on the table before	Contradiction
C	so now what they're doing he's just advertised tonight that
D	and
C	he's now doing er packs for just two people
A	oh really?
C	because people had said you're doing a family pack why can't you do any just for two people?
D	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Person D is thinking about the Person C's problem	Entailment
A	ah especially in this area where
C	so now he's putting a pack up for two people
A	yeah there's a lot of elderly and
C	but now they've started actually taking orders from Facebook and they're delivering them in the
A	really?
[ANNOTATION]	Person A is gonna dance	Contradiction
C	mm
B	blimey
D	but it seems crazy doesn't it?
D	cos you think well that's a local butcher we could've been just doing that anyway could've gone
unknown_female	yeah
D	on a Saturday morning ordered it but yeah it's that I suppose
unknown_female	yeah
B	as I said when you're on the internet yeah
D	I still like to look at things and
unknown_female	mm
B	consuming information it's going in but when you're out and about
unknown_female	yeah
B	you don't wanna be reading stuff thinking of it writing it down everything you're in
D	yeah
B	you set yourself up to
D	well it involves more steps if you
B	yeah
A	yeah
D	especially if it's something and you think oh do I want to go to that? or not?
A	and the time between
D	whereas at home you can
B	the chicken van yeah
A	oh yes
C	yeah erm
C	so I got a message tonight I'm sorry the chickens aren't ready so we won't be coming this week on er Friday night
C	we'll be coming next weekend on Friday night but for me that's it's a great warning cos I'll know now to have maybe the cash ready
C	for

C	I love
D	mm
D	mm
C	chicken sausages
A	oh
C	eh they're honestly they're lovely

C	no
E	no it's quality
D	in Tesco in
A	yeah
A	yeah we should do that
E	yeah
C	we get two chicken breasts and there's more than enough for the three of us and usually
C	sometimes
E	well I didn't cos I'd be eating it rather than giving it to
D	no mam means it would would do er
E	but
C	you haven't said flipping have you?
E	you
E	I think I probably did
E	you saw advertised on Facebook the fact that

C	pet food we tried it this week
E	yeah
C	a pound for a er
B	I saw I saw a laminated sheet on his door for that and I didn't register it cos at the time I just wasn't taking stuff in
C	right
B	but when you're on the internet obviously you
C	mm
A	yeah
C	er when I went in I said I'm gonna try one of these pet packs and he said well it's just it's heart liver and er left over
D	people have face-to-face
C	she loved it
unknown_female	mm
C	lasted about three nights
A	did it?
D	mm
C	mm
A	very good
D	yeah but
D	once the trouble was we cooked it and then didn't freeze it or I wasn't I wouldn't've been happy
C	no
A	mm especially if he's delivering stuff as well
C	yeah I don't know how I don't know if he would come out this far but it did say
C	well I think it's very good for them and
A	mm yeah you want the independence to do
