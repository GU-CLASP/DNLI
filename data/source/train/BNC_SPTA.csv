A	ought to test it actually
B	is it working?
A	I'm presuming it's recording
C	so is a format it has to come in or
A	MP3
C	right
B	could you pass me the pepper
A	there you go
A	mm but people just forget it's on anyway and
A	like
B	it looks delicious
C	mm
A	mm how come unhealthy food is cheaper? that's a bit cruel
C	well what by do you mean like a a nice piece of erm fish?
A	yeah expensive
C	it's
A	more expensive than this
C	mm yeah
A	mm pasta's a little bit hard isn't it?
B	no it's delicious
C	lovely
B	uhu
C	what cheese did you use?
A	actually where would the speaker be on this? I mean the
B	the
C	the mic
A	the microphone
B	the Somerset cheddar had been intended for my lunch tomorrow morning
C	oh
B	tomorrow at work
C	you won't have to go hungry now will you?
B	potentially yes
B	it's nice it works very well with the spinach I would
A	yes it does
B	say
C	but this can't be all bad though
A	er
B	it's pretty not
A	quite bad
A	erm carbohydrate fest isn't it really?
C	got your greens
A	mm there's not a lot er in there
B	it's got one of your five a day
A	only just barely
B	onion
A	the onions are good though
C	this is far superior to a macaroni cheese I remember
B	did your mummy used to make it?
C	yeah she did
A	she did I didn't like it then
C	she
A	it took me years to erm like macaroni cheese
C	she actually used macaroni
A	mm
C	which I just always found it very slimy I didn't
A	no macaroni's lovely I usually use macaroni
B	well it was probably how she made the cheese sauce that was the erm issue
A	no it was years before I started making macaroni cheese cos I did have that
B	I mean it but it might have been like a granular cheese sauce add boiling water
A	no
C	it was
A	but I remember not liking macaroni cheese
C	yes it wasn't very tasty I don't think just just very
A	mm
C	slimy I
B	mm
C	to me
A	or something that you don't like when you're younger
C	yeah
B	what?
A	macaroni cheese
B	uhu
C	you see I don't think she added anything like onion or I think it literally was
C	macaroni and cheese sauce wasn't it?
A	yeah mm probably yeah
B	I'd still maintain that she probably didn't do a real French cheese sauce like with a roux
A	well how would she have
C	yeah in fact she she taught me how to make sauces
A	I've got a
B	okay
A	white sauce in my cookery book
C	mm
A	that came from her and
C	mm
A	it's done with the flour and
B	well I I stand corrected
A	butter
C	yeah you melt a bit of butter and then you
A	mm
C	add the
C	yeah and I always remember erm thinking it was a miracle cos when I first started making it it goes all lumpy
A	mm
C	and you you panic and you go oh my god it's just gone all lumpy
A	yes it's all quite chemical isn't it?
C	I think you have to have faith and and
A	mm
C	keep whisking and add the milk and
A	yes
B	she was always surprised when I would do a real gravy
A	yes so what did we do with gravy did she just?
B	which is the same kind of principle isn't it?
A	I remember gravy as being very thin
C	it was only though erm
C	in later years that she started using those packet gravies she used to make it properly
A	yeah
C	proper gravy
A	I remember yeah
C	using the the the
A	they didn't come in till later
C	juice from the meat and the veg water
A	mm
C	and
B	and cooking through a flour in the fat to be the thickening agent
A	I remember loving Sunday roasts
B	mm you still do dear
A	mm
C	mm
B	I think this gains more from the spinach than it loses from not having bacon
A	it does actually yeah you're right but I also think it needs that extra something otherwise it's too much cheese and pasta
B	and spinach
A	no otherwise it's too much cheese and pasta
C	have you put garlic in it?
A	no
B	no
C	I shall have a smidgen
B	what time are we expecting
C	well er the boat's supposed to get in at nine thirty and he's got to drive from Portsmouth
B	that's quite late
A	and so what is?
B	that's very late
A	there's some work being done on the road isn't there again?
B	not our bit
C	it looked alright there was one bollard
A	right
C	further up the road but that was all I mean just
B	they're gonna re-lay the lower half of the road
C	it looks so much smarter doesn't it?
A	mm it does
C	what when we were at home?
A	yeah
C	I don't know I remember there were lots of ones I hated liver and bacon on Mondays I hated
A	I used to like that
B	she loves
A	I think I like
C	no I don't I don't mind it now but something it was always really dry I remember
A	well it was very tough yes
C	it was like
A	mm I remember
C	I don't remember having a favourite I think it was cakes
A	the cakes were good
C	yes we had some good cakes
A	mm walnut cake coffee walnut cake was good
C	mm bachelor's buttons
A	oh
C	used to make those double quantities cos they used to go in about five seconds
A	mm
B	we always my sister and I always used to think that my father was a a brilliant cook but then only in hindsight when we were adults we realised that actually what we had was mini pizzas from the freezer and oven chips
B	but delicious er or he he was famous for his casserole which was was made from that it was made from a tin of Uncle Ben's sauce
C	mm
B	so in hindsight it it seems less spectacular
A	but great at that time
C	that was quite exotic though isn't it pizza? we never had pizza
A	no I remember when pizza was new
B	don't know if they do
A	fairly new
B	those little mini pizzas anymore they were the rage in er
A	yeah the seventies mm
B	the late seventies mid to late seventies
A	yeah frozen
B	you'd get just a pack of twelve just boring cheese and tomato
C	mm
A	mm
B	absolutely nothing on them
A	that was it
A	yeah
B	finish that off
A	I used to think they were great
C	no no I've had enough thank you

A	yeah completely
A	so do you want to go and watch Hinterland then? we're loving Hinterland
B	oh yes
C	it's it's finished hasn't it?
A	probably but we're watching it on the
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B also wants to watch the Hinterland.	Entailment
C	we're well or
A	player
C	oh you're watching old ones right
B	we're behind
A	mm
B	the er general sequence yeah
C	cos I erm I think I missed the last one but it finished a couple of weeks ago
[ANNOTATION]	Hinterland is a thriller.	Neutral
A	I love the grimness
B	you always chuckle when he gets his torch out
A	he gets his torch out all the time
A	he never puts the light on
C	oh no that would be no fun would it?
A	no
B	they're not currently this series
A	and always visits someone in the dark
B	this series they they're not doing the running joke of him getting
A	he always gets beaten up as well
B	facial injuries
A	he's
B	he is getting beaten up still but
A	yeah
B	accrued
A	through the last episode he more and more kind of like
B	accrued additional injuries
A	and then like additional injuries it was
C	there's something about the the the the the woman er detective she's always wearing her red parka there's something about that
A	yeah
C	isn't there?
A	the red coat all the time
C	yeah
A	just
C	is it from like
A	it's funny
C	erm Don't Look Now the film you know?
A	so maybe symbolism or something
C	yeah we don't
C	the the dwarf
A	yeah
C	walking round in the red
B	or it could be Nabokovian ah
A	well I love their filters you know the cinematographic filters
B	it's a beautiful
A	yeah it's all very
B	what is it where where is it sort of
A	the grim
B	do you know what part of
C	it's it's from Swansea I think
B	is it?
A	it's absolutely gorgeous
C	yeah
B	it's absolutely stunning
C	yeah
A	it makes me want to go there cos where was that house that we saw that had that amazing view of the sea? erm
B	in
A	inside the house that must have been Swansea I suppose
B	you mean in Hinterland?
A	yeah
A	yeah
C	mm
B	on the you know
C	but it looks really bleak
A	oh I wanna go there
C	and cold
A	oh I love that
B	oh that's what I like about it
A	oh and
B	actually we're watching it out of sequence so it's also a bit strange cos the last one we saw was just a normal thing but then the episode before that ended with him being burnt out of his holiday whatever you call it caravan
A	I think that was last I don't know anyway
B	no cos we we watched it out of sequence
A	we are watching it out of sequence
C	mm
B	oh gosh I hope that wasn't the end of the series we may have watched them all
A	it might be they're very
C	it did it did end very suddenly
B	did it end with his house burning down?
C	well I didn't I I think I must have not seen that one because I had been away and I said to
A	oh
C	so maybe that was
A	it's erm it's very expensive the films cos it's really beautifully er crafted and
C	mm
A	er it makes me laugh though cos it's got everybody always erm people don't really do this in real life but they were erm
A	stare at each other after they've said something
C	yeah
A	you know
B	there's a lot of that
B	yeah
B	in his slightly too
A	it's like if that happened in real life it would be really embarrassing it's like mm what? what?
C	yeah
B	his slightly too
A	what are you looking at?
B	close fitting trousers and jacket
C	yeah and
A	oh yeah
B	furrowed brow
A	everyone has a
C	but you the when audio describing something like that it's it becomes so hard because there's only so many times you can say furrowed brow and you know
A	yeah
C	their eyes lock
A	the lingering stare is so funny
B	a pregnant pause
C	and it's kind of like
A	yeah
C	oh got to think of something else to say
A	yeah
C	and they're doing it all the time
A	yeah
C	but er
A	it is a bit funny but the torch is especially makes me laugh there he is he's got his touch out again
C	he gets out his torch
B	thing is when he gets it out he never tries to see if the light
B	work
C	so you watch it all on Iplayer?
A	yeah
C	cos you don't
B	the other one we always enjoyed was what was it? terrible name crime stories back case
A	oh
B	Case History
A	that wasn't very good really
B	I always liked that
A	mm
B	and I thought the lead in that was terrific he I've never seen him in anything else ever
A	he probably is
B	he's a terrific lead
A	I can't remember his name
B	but it it was the same series
C	mm
A	yeah similar
B	where where I mean in terms of the characterisation
A	he was always out jogging
B	he was always out jogging and then
A	mm
B	doing pregnant
A	oh that was that was more light-hearted though that wasn't nearly as sort of
B	oh it had much more of
A	dark
B	a of a comedic
A	kind of yeah
B	element when when in
A	it wasn't
B	into his interaction with various other characters
A	this is the bleakest one I've ever come across really for bleakness and even even bleaker than Vera which is set up north and it's
C	what about all the erm the Nordic ones? were you watching any of those?
A	yeah cos this is very based on those I think
B	yes yeah so there a real fashion for those now
A	and they they they must have started the whole
B	you I also think part of the reason why it's bilingual is specifically to appeal to in terms of marketing it
A	well it's very trendy isn't it?
C	mm
B	in the Nordic countries
A	yeah well no I don't know why they just don't have the whole thing in Welsh and have subtitles
B	they do they they they've they've done more series
A	but they don't have subtitles
B	oh no no but I mean
A	yeah
B	they they have done for for erm Welsh TV
A	but why not have subtitles? cos it's really trendy at the moment to have subtitles
C	yeah yeah
B	but he doesn't speak Welsh
A	I mean I'd watch it
B	or is that does his character doesn't speak Welsh?
A	no he doesn't erm no he must do in the other ones though
C	so in the Welsh version
B	that's a good point
A	the Welsh ones yeah
C	unless he speaks English and they have Welsh subtitles for when he
B	so there you go maybe so
A	oh I don't know
B	cos it's er really for Welsh speakers
A	but why not just have more Welsh things with the subtitles?
C	mm
A	it makes sense
C	but it must be really weird for the actors cos they have to do everything twice once in Welsh and once in English
A	but they're not the same ones though are they?
B	yeah
A	are they?
C	I think so yeah oh there's been
B	I think there's been additional series that have never been shown on on BBC which
A	I thought that
B	er on BBC England
A	it probably started out as Welsh
B	which are entirely in Welsh
A	and then
C	so are you watching it on BBC London then?
B	no we're watching it on
A	Iplayer
C	Wales? BBC Wales?
B	the
A	no just the Iplayer it's on BBC4
C	cos it's really weird
B	BBC4 so the BBC Wales one I think maybe was
A	is Welsh
B	and there've been additional series which haven't been shown
A	it is Welsh? cos I looked it up
B	yeah there you go
A	and it's called
B	mm good ish
A	or something
C	yes
C	phonetically
B	that's the same name as my mother-in-law's former husband
B	so now you have to anonymise it do you see what I did then darling?
A	ah I see name
B	proper noun
B	I'm gonna go and test that key
A	yeah
B	oh well let me have you found it?
C	no I'm going to go and look for it and I'm going to test it
B	well hang on I'll
C	uhu I I've found a key
B	that's it
B	er
B	well that's the that's the only key so
C	well let me go and give it a try
B	yeah
A	I'll just follow you with the thing
C	do you
B	yeah
B	only if there's no one in but sometimes
C	right
B	that light looks beautiful
A	mm
C	well that one works
A	I'm finishing all the sweets
B	what sweets are you eating now? the oh darling today
B	and everything and then I looked the person sat next to me was eating a multipack of those they're called Reese or something they're American peanut cookies
A	oh shit
B	so I had to get up and
A	and you felt it on your head?
B	I just felt like all my nerve endings
A	on there
B	just not quite right
A	so sensitive
B	and my lips yeah I am quite sensitive
A	mm it's good
B	so I had to get up and walk away
C	what happened?
B	just the girl next to me at work we sit really shoulder to shoulder started eating they're called I think they're called Reese I I've seen them before
C	oh yes
B	they're like a bright orange packaging
C	yeah
B	and they're
C	they're American aren't they?
B	yeah they're an American peanut cookie or
C	yes
B	and there's er just sat there going like
A	that's the
B	there she is tucking in and then I start to get sort of you know tingly
C	oh legally don't you have to have a certain amount of space? I mean you shouldn't have to be
B	I think legally we have enough space but what they've been doing over the years
A	they just do the
B	and the company has expanded erm there's been a erm a sort of requisite
A	of course
C	so you have to be
B	across individual desks
C	quite quite slim to get a job
B	and also the the spaces between the aisles
A	oh it's disgusting
B	is as well I don't I mean I don't mind it it's not
A	oh I hate it
B	as long as people aren't eating
A	no I hate it
B	peanutty things I don't I don't really mind it
A	yeah but people eat fruit people eating bananas oh I can't bear it you know? and they're it's like there and they start eating fruit and bananas and it's like oh
B	but I mean I'm happy to tell something if I think what they're doing is antisocial I didn't tell the girl eating peanuts
C	mm
B	cos it
A	but even just eating at the desk's
B	erm
A	a bit gross when other people are there
C	yeah I mean
A	mm
C	but to have somebody
A	I mean cos that's what I can't bare about bare about it that's why I can't do it it's it's erm no
C	how's how's your ear now? are you still doing the eardrops?
B	it seems okay now
A	has it cleared?
B	well I've not had the same kind of issues yeah
A	it's unblocked itself then has it?
B	well it's no longer blocked whether it will become re-blocked in the next sort of
C	was it wax that was blocking it?
A	yeah
C	mm you didn't have to have it syringed then or?
B	no
A	that's good
C	hoovered out
B	no
A	but
B	well I went yeah had had I been to the nurse before we had that conversation?
C	you said you were putting the drops in
B	no I think that was just what I I'd bought yeah sorry
C	mm
B	whatever the
C	bicarbonate and olive oil? I've never heard
B	just cos bicarbonate of soda
A	I've never heard of that one
B	no I've heard of olive oil but not bicarbonate of soda it would go all fizzy wouldn't it?
B	well yeah she she cos all she wrote on the little is a little erm
A	weird
B	okay so the powder
C	that's you use in cooking yeah
A	that's for teeth
B	the powder so then I
B	so then I had to stop her and say okay so but I I dilute the bicarbonate of soda in
C	water?
B	olive oil? or or or mix it with olive oil or water? she went no no no no no no no oh silly me you you get that from the pharmacy and sure enough
C	the way she said you would have been putting
B	yeah exactly yeah shaking it into you picture that I think that's what she pictured
B	and sure enough it's one of the sort of ear cleaning products that that that you find off off the shelf er not even from the
A	never head of it
C	and so did it fizz? cos I've used one of those and
B	it didn't
C	they they go all bubbly and fizzy in your ear
B	they didn't fizz but er that might just be me cos it always fizzes for
A	there's another one that does fizz called Optrex or something like that and it fizzes and I really like that
B	but I think that's just a
A	it's fizzing
B	that's a urea based acid which I had previously been using but anyway it seems to have cleared up so
A	that's good cos you can't have it syringed anyway can you?
B	er I want to
A	cos of your asthma
B	avoid that
B	but it's the only time I've ever had like
A	things wrong with you
B	blocked ears
A	he's got so many ailments
C	he's doing very well on it though
A	very well
C	don't seem to be letting it hold you back
A	mm
B	keep telling
B	which is true because in the old days when I worked with a couple of my favourite colleagues we'd be out every night well
A	yes
B	not literally every night but
A	you were actually
B	but maybe three out of five
A	and quite

B	so he's in a bit of a a
C	he's got to get designer frames has he? and

B	right
A	we've got to get
B	I might turn up in
A	okay yes
B	we could watch Hinterland
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about Hinterland	Neutral
B	then you could supervise as I gently drift off peacefully
A	then I might get up again and do some work
B	could do
A	mm
B	do it quietly but what if
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about a film	Contradiction
A	er I will I will slither out
B	have you chosen what book you'd like?

B	yeah there you go
A	is it any book?
B	I've got a voucher that will buy any Kindle book so yes

B	self-help
A	yes another self-help book I think
B	mm probably I didn't think you were going to say
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about book	Entailment
A	oh what about one about another one about the menopause?
B	Tristram Shandy
B	Tristram Shandy
A	is that a writer is it?
B	it's a novel
C	I can't remember who wrote that
A	I'm loving my Kindle at the moment
B	Laurence Sterne
A	oh
C	what sort of Kindle have you got?
A	got the old one I want the white one the one with white
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about book	Entailment
C	what the one the one with the buttons you press?
A	er
B	it's the
A	no
B	version after that but annoyingly I bought it
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about school	Contradiction
C	they brought the touch one with the
B	the latest erm you know bells and whistles
C	mm
B	one
A	but I if I I differentiate between erm
B	it is is it touchscreen? I think it is
A	yeah I differentiate between the tablet ones and the the ones that are exclusively readers because the readers are like books and they read as
C	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	they are having a conversation about ebooks	Entailment
A	they've got a page look and everything
B	yeah but no but the then they
A	so I don't really even compare them
B	brought out the the paper white whatever it's called
A	oh the paper white that's the one I want
B	and it's back lit
C	cos
B	that's a tablet which is
A	that's a tablet
B	one that we were looking at buying
A	I don't even consider that a reader
B	as buying as a tablet
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a does not want to buy a paper white	Contradiction
C	mm
B	not as
A	no
B	not as
A	yeah
B	a reader
A	but the e-
A	light and the white
C	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b considers the paper white a tablet	Entailment
A	paper but they probably did that on purpose didn't they? cos maybe they could have done that first but I've got the grey page and I've always thought that's a bit grey can't I
C	mm
A	turn it up a bit?
C	yeah
B	none of them used to do it until quite well quite recently in the last sort of
A	bet they had the technology
B	three or four years cos I remember having a conversation with erm
C	yes
A	yeah
B	without a light on
A	yes
B	whilst
[ANNOTATION]	e-readers didn't have light before	Entailment
C	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b said that e-readers didn't have light since three or four years ago	Entailment
B	her husband
A	exactly
B	kipped
C	yeah
B	and of course with all the readers you needed a light
C	yeah
B	er
A	and then now
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b thinks that readers need a light	Entailment
B	and so I researched and and I found a couple of things that
A	you'd have thought
B	cos now
A	they could have done that firstly
B	now they're all backlit and you can read them
C	mm
A	that's just so that you have to buy another one I'm sure
C	well no
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about books	Neutral
B	well no they
C	mine's an antique now
A	is it?
B	they
A	I think they would have had the technology
B	I mean that no one ever thought of applying it they had the technology
C	you
B	yeah cos they had
C	but
B	all kinds of er
C	yes you could have a sort of light you could clipped on the top
A	I've seen those
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a believes it is impossible the necessary technology would have existed	Contradiction
B	they had all extras like that yeah
C	yeah
A	I don't think it's worth me getting a clip-on light because I'll end up getting erm the Kindle white one probably Christmas or something
B	well it doesn't it doesn't and it doesn't keep me up anyway does it so?
A	it doesn't actually but I'd like to read in the dark I think
B	and er
A	that would be nice
B	ah oh I worry about your eyes though cos you do a lot
C	they're supposed to be kind
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a wants to buy themselves an e-reader	Entailment
A	it doesn't glare like a
C	yeah like a computer yeah
A	computer it doesn't feel the same way at all but I don't know it's obviously not a page page but it's a beautiful thing to I mean even the old one I've got it's very beautifully clear and I love the way you can just make the writing whatever size you want to and everything
C	yes but then you've
C	thing is I've got to the stage now
[ANNOTATION]	computers are different from e-readers	Entailment
A	yeah okay
C	I end up getting about three words per page
C	so it's not
A	it's gets worrying
B	I can't do
A	yeah
B	without my proper book though
A	we've got to the stage where we need a magnifying glass now we definitely need to buy a magnifying glass cos there are some little things
B	we looked at them in the shop didn't we darling?
[ANNOTATION]	speaker c doesn't need a big font size to read well	Contradiction
A	yeah we are gonna get one
C	you can get some beautiful desk ones I want one of those ones you put on and it's got it's like on a stand with an arm and extendable arm?
A	oh that sounds nice
C	so you can just hold it over your
A	yeah
C	they're beautiful some of them
B	ah
[ANNOTATION]	speaker c thinks desk magnifying glasses are terrible	Contradiction
B	it is
A	no it's not it's just
B	they're super excited
C	yeah no no er
C	this is not from this is not from
A	ah
A	what is that his er pocket money?
C	well his living money his er cos he he lives in he doesn't live at home anymore he lives in
A	of course it would be living money wouldn't it?
B	does
C	well not we don't know
B	and it'll probably be like that for a while then won't it? you not knowing now
C	yeah
B	cos you're so English because you are English?
C	yes cos our French is so bad
B	yeah
A	yes that's the answer was yes
C	an underfloor heating
A	yes
C	oh right oh did you get my email?
A	yeah I did yeah
C	oh right I wasn't sure cos I was didn't it come through
A	yeah that's fine I'll be here well just let me know when what when it's on the way or whatever
C	yeah I don't think he's ordered it yet so
A	yeah
C	mm
B	well I might turn in that darling is that alright? you come up
A	yeah
B	just to watch Hinterland at least?
A	I will come up to watch Hinterland we've done another forty-five minutes so that's quite good really so that's eighteen pounds plus forty-five minutes that's nearly
A	two hours' worth so
B	are you allowed to discuss the financial
A	I don't see why not it's all words isn't it?
B	it seems to somehow demean it though
A	it's what it's all about
B	uhu
A	it's about money
C	do they have to have erm a big variety of people talking though?
A	yes
C	so you can't have it you
A	they've got to cover the whole country
B	that's my worry when I said is there a political bias on the basis that if it's just sort of twenty somethings
A	no it's everybody
B	and and often student-based
A	no no no no it's all age groups
B	that you're gonna get a very quite a specific
C	yeah
B	erm demographic
C	most people are left wing though
B	well not according to the
A	all of them across the board I've only done one
B	not according to election results my dear
A	exactly but maybe that's means that people don't admit to it
C	no exactly I think that's that's more the point
A	it's because it's erm
C	people don't people
A	it's morally more right to be left wing so that's how people will talk but when it comes to electing
B	you become more selfish
A	yeah
C	yes
A	ultimately
B	yeah yeah
A	it must be
C	right
A	it must be something to be ashamed of then to be right wing
C	but I suppose right wing politics you wouldn't kind of go
A	cos it's very mean sounding ring wing
C	exactly isn't it? I mean it's alright
A	so you don't want to sound like
C	to say something left wing like I think we should all look after
A	we should share
C	every member of society
C	whereas if you say no I I I earned worked very hard to earn my money and I'm not giving it to anybody
A	exactly this is the difference and you're not gonna say that cos it's kind of impolite even so
C	right I'm gonna go and think of an answer to this text
A	okay
C	oh
B	how do you send in him your money? do you just do they just
C	I do a bank transfer
B	ah it's not like a brown paper envelope?
B	with
C	no
A	coming
B	mm I I put him right in front of it
C	I think I think we might have forgotten to bring towels I don't know if if
A	okay
B	ah that could be a problem cos
A	luckily we've just washed some
B	we may not have any clean ones
A	yeah we do
C	well
A	I washed some
C	if you've just have you got one spare? cos I
A	they're still a tiny bit damp but we've got some
B	then why are they in a cupboard then
A	because I needed to make room for the sheets
B	is
A	can you manage with one or do you want two?
C	oh just just give us what's there thank you
B	is
A	well what do you mean am I sure?
