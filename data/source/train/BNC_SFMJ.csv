A	look at that tree
C	yeah and yeah and the aerials
A	yes
C	yeah
A	through
C	yeah
A	through there as well I like that
C	yes yes
C	actually I thought
C	it occurred to me
A	I'd love to go to
B	oh sweet
B	sweet
A	although
B	it only took us how long did it take us?
C	oh just over an hour
B	yeah
C	I mean it's very little amazingly little just by
A	well when we went on the train it was super
C	oh
A	easy
C	yeah
A	that was going dunno it was like going somewhere in
C	yeah I'm sure it just took an hour to get down erm
A	well this is why I thought I want to do a day trip to
C	yeah but we could go in the car
A	yes
C	what thinkest thou?
B	uhu
B	have to get up early
A	we would actually
C	well
A	mm
C	what do you call early anyway?
A	I might be a little grumpy
B	nineish?
A	well
C	yeah
C	well you're I mean as long as you left by eleven so long as
A	yeah
C	you left by eleven
A	so that would be quicker than going say to visit see
C	oh much quicker
C	yeah
A	that's bizarre isn't it?
B	well we should invite
C	yeah
A	well we'll play it by ear see
C	yeah
A	how we feel but I think that's a very good idea
C	yeah
A	there's a lovely second hand bookshop that I'd like to go to
C	would it be open on a Sunday?
A	I don't oh
C	oh I know I know the bookshop you mean actually yes
A	yeah
C	yes
A	cos things still close in
A	and I forget that
A	and it's not holiday season
C	no
A	true
C	no exactly
A	good point
C	yeah
A	mm mm we could check things on the internet
C	yeah
A	or we could
C	you've got nobody living down there now have you? they still own a house don't they?
A	yeah we have got someone living down there
C	oh yeah because
A	but I think she won't be there
C	yeah
A	she'll probably be in
B	why?
A	because it's my mum's thing
C	oh right yes
A	so I sent her but I've sent her
C	and that's her grandmother
A	yes
C	yes
A	that's her grandmother
C	yeah yeah so what are they actually doing are they taking her out for a meal or what?
A	no they're going to the care home
C	uhu
A	and I'm not sure really
C	yeah
A	I thought
C	probably having a birthday cake
A	well yes but my mum's just going to be daunted by the whole thing really and I thought it didn't really sound like a very good idea actually because
C	oh
A	cos I thought she's sort of not gonna know who anybody is
C	mm yeah
A	well
C	yes
A	and I thought she's certainly not gonna know who I am if I go there
C	yeah yeah
A	and she doesn't need another person well you know
C	yeah
A	it's more for the children than er than her really
C	yes yes
A	so
C	photographs with grandma or maybe great great grandma?
A	yeah
C	yeah?
A	well it will be hold on no would be great
C	does your mum have any
A	great?

C	why? why?
C	who are the others?
B	mm
C	yeah
C	how many do your the people who used to live next door to you in
A	how many what?
C	children do they have?
A	two now
C	yeah
A	yeah
B	Look at the Harlequins
A	mm
B	uhu
A	it looks really nice so we're lacking books on the two top shelves
B	it's cos I don't read small paperbacks is the issue
A	so they're never going to get filled then what are gonna do about that
B	well I could try and find some editions of books I read that are smaller
A	mm
B	it's just miscalculated
C	this is well calculated though why didn't you do them the same?
A	yeah
B	well mix and match we just didn't match as much as we mixed
A	well we needed to match what
C	yeah the
A	we own
C	it it fits
A	mm
C	the I mean obviously it would take a paperback
A	yes
C	you know a standard paperback
A	yeah but
C	yeah he doesn't like paperbacks
A	important books
C	yeah yeah
C	no
A	from WH Smith's
C	mm
A	well actually paperbacks are quite big aren't they really?
B	well they
A	in WH Smith those are quite small
C	well they can be big yes
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	yes
C	up there rather than a
A	yeah
C	a soft covered
A	mm
C	a soft covered hard book if you see what I mean
A	yes
C	so I've been working away at my Greek
A	yes
C	hey
A	are you going to take a GCSE in it?
C	do you know I I've downloaded the the syllabus
A	yes
C	for that?
A	well it's a good thing to
C	yeah
A	aim for cos it makes you
C	yeah
A	do it doesn't it?
C	yes yeah
A	erm
B	did you bring the coriander?
C	yes I did er
A	presumably that nice cosy pub is open did you go to the nice cosy pub in
B	which pub?
A	well what's it called? the one that's got the erm homebrewed beer or something
B	mm that's nice it's called something like
A	cos we need if we go there we need places to go
C	yes yeah
B	could go to the
C	otherwise we won't
B	we'd go to the
C	have much fun
B	pub right on the coast
C	I mean to be down at the water even on I mean on a day like this would be quite dramatic actually
A	it's gonna be
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	very cold
B	then we could go for fish and chips
A	mm
C	oh yes
B	by the erm
A	oh I wonder if that caf√©'s open by the sea the one that we sat in and looked at the sea
C	and you took photographs
A	what's that one called?
B	er yes that would be open that's a nice walk to get round to too
A	yeah oh I could look at my dream house as well
C	I thought that was up in Campbeltown
B	that was mine
A	no I've got a dream house in
C	oh right
A	but I'm suggesting we should go on holiday to these places and then we can look at them for fun
C	yeah
A	yes
C	erm
A	well we could we could sell this place and not have a mortgage we could buy a place in Scotland with the change
C	yeah
A	he'll have to I don't know
C	you've got
C	why won't you want to become a teacher?
B	I've no inclination to
A	you'd be an excellent primary school teacher you've be very funny
C	yeah you would be a very good primary teacher
A	yeah
C	actually yeah
A	he's not got the inclination to do it though have you
B	no
A	he just doesn't want to
C	no
A	so that's that
C	the one member of the
A	it's traditional
C	yeah
C	he's managed to avoid it
A	I wonder if
C	well yes
A	as well
C	yeah
A	mm what's
C	yeah
A	what's she going?
C	well I asked her you know I said you know
A	oh
C	the top because you know
A	that's one of those
C	oh well that that makes me
A	oh no
C	panic that just makes me
A	yeah
C	panic
A	what are you gonna do?
C	yeah yes
C	yeah
A	stressful thing like
C	and particularly
A	what am I gonna do?
C	yeah particularly in her field when there's
A	yeah I know
C	you know it's not that
A	there must be nothing
A	in that
C	yes yeah
A	erm well though
C	and and
A	but then everything is competitive
C	yeah
A	now
C	oh yes
A	and it's more competitive than it ever was
C	yes
A	it's ridiculously
C	yeah
A	even for real starter jobs
C	yes yes
A	you know really crappy mundane jobs
C	yeah yeah
A	there's loads of competition
C	a huge amount of
A	and they expect this sort of level of
C	yeah
A	brilliance it's just awful it's worse than it ever was
C	yeah
A	so if you're a young person now I mean in a way it puts it off for three years doesn't it? if you do a degree it kind of puts off
C	well it it it
A	the decision
C	it puts it off yes
A	yeah
C	yes but erm yeah but you know when I was qualifying as er in pure science
A	mm
C	er there were science erm what do you call them?
C	exhibitions if you like
A	oh
C	when all the employers
A	okay
C	came up to
A	were there
C	university
A	to recruit
C	and there were booths around all the places ICI Courtaulds Ferranti's
A	mm
C	every single er thing that employed scientists
A	okay
C	and they were more or less saying you know we we are
A	come and work for us
C	we've got these jobs that are available
A	wow
C	would you like? we are we are based in whatever
A	that's nice
C	and just swanned in no I don't I don't want to walk work in Stroud and
A	oh how lovely
C	and you could have left with
A	that wouldn't happen now
C	you know an assured job no
C	and in actual fact Courtaulds
A	yeah
C	it cut off
A	yes
C	really quite quickly
A	yeah
C	er just a few years after I graduated but you know we could have got just
A	and that's science as well
C	anything anywhere
A	I mean
C	yeah
A	art
C	yeah mind you
A	anything artistic
C	if you're a maths teacher or a physics teacher you could walk into a job
A	well that's the thing
C	just like that
A	with being a teacher isn't it? it's
C	yeah
A	you and people always need teachers
C	well exactly yes yeah
A	and so
C	and it's a
A	that is the most sensible thing to go for
C	it's yeah
A	in your life isn't it?
C	it is
A	yeah
C	because you know
A	exactly
C	it's every single town
A	mm
C	has schools yeah
A	yeah
C	yeah what
A	what to do
C	what to yes
C	yeah
A	and how much money do you want?
C	yeah
A	erm
C	yeah
A	and they're the sort of questions that are
C	mm
A	but the problem is your what you want changes so you might not be bothered about that
C	because after all
A	at a crucial time
C	and your experience is nil
A	yes
C	in a sense you're
A	yeah
C	er it would be easy
A	exactly
C	now to answer
A	no exactly
C	questions and you
A	I know
C	so you can go back and be twenty again
A	and you're not bothered when you're that age
C	yeah no
A	and and those things don't matter like
C	mm mm
A	owning a house
C	yeah
A	doesn't really mean anything
C	no
A	cos you don't know what not owning a house
C	house is yes
A	is
C	is yeah
A	cos it's all there on a plate
C	yeah
A	for you and
C	mm
A	erm and later on it starts to matter and then you haven't done what it takes to get those things
C	things no
A	that was my thing cos I
C	mm
A	I found out later what I wanted and then it's like oh damn it I haven't really
C	haven't
A	haven't sorted it out
C	trod the right steps
A	yeah oh look at this
A	and that
B	it could be that chemical you see
A	we'll have to wash it cos it's well luckily it does wash well
C	yeah
A	well luckily it does wash
[ANNOTATION]	it cannot get wet	Contradiction
C	well did
A	no she didn't
C	no she didn't
A	mention that
C	no
A	oh true cos she'll be back in a year won't she?
C	yeah but mind you they're doing the house they they're certainly but
A	yeah
C	I suspect
A	we might be sofaless
C	well I suspect that she won't
B	we shall see
[ANNOTATION]	it can be washed	Entailment
C	yes yes
A	she might want a new one
C	yes yes or she might see something that's more
A	yeah
C	period like
A	but I do think that you can always take steps at whatever stage in life
C	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	she will be angry	Neutral
A	and so you go I want that what do I have to do to get it? and then you can
C	yes and it's never too late
A	you can do something I mean it's not too late no
C	no
A	I don't think it's ever too late
[ANNOTATION]	it is too late	Contradiction
C	mm oh look at
A	but
C	parents yes yeah we are actually I mean yes yeah
A	and she's got erm obviously
C	her own mum
A	her own mum and she's got her dad
C	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	her parents are away	Neutral
A	and the dad's family
C	yeah yeah
A	so lucky I think
C	yeah
A	she's got all these
C	she's going out to Japan for
A	oh is she?
C	about ten days
A	to Japan
B	it's news to me
C	yeah well it's only been booked
A	otherwise
C	yeah
A	they won't speak to you
C	mm mm
A	it's just so expensive to go
C	yeah I think er I think her flight is something like six hundred
A	mm
C	which actually considering it's as far as that it's er that's pretty
A	yeah
C	pretty good value yeah when we bought fares they were about six hundred cos er we paid about twelve hundred pounds sound alarming doesn't it?
A	gosh
C	half a log burner
A	six hundred pounds we do not have
C	no
A	but if they offer to pay for you
C	I think all their money is now invested in er
A	yeah
B	still don't have a passport
A	oh gosh I've got to renew mine as well
C	yeah you yeah you must well you must you should never be without
A	no
C	an up-to-date passport actually
A	no it's true
C	and sometimes it does take a long long wait
A	well it erm
C	I mean well it's
A	I'm assuming it would
C	yeah
A	yeah
A	mm
C	her passport wasn't long enough for her to go to Japan and because
A	yeah
C	that was the first time she was going for several months
A	mm
C	so I drove her up to
A	mm
C	and for a significant sum of money
A	mm
C	we got it there and then
A	it's ridiculous how
C	yes yeah
A	you have to pay
C	yeah
A	I mean what for? what are you actually paying for? for somebody
C	yeah
A	to shuffle some paper?
A	it's ridiculous
C	a what?
C	is there really?
A	yeah
C	hand my little machine over can you darling?
B	don't just play a silly game though mummy
C	no I'm going to look up
B	you do some absolute rubbish on yours don't you dear?
B	why don't you look up?
C	oh well let's have a look at the weather
B	what's that stain there?
A	no that's what I was asking you
B	bottom
A	it looks like a nasty stain
A	okay
C	nine degrees and six
A	sunny's good
C	whereas today it's saying thick cloud
A	well yes
C	eleven and five and a reasonable wind speed tomorrow the wind is not as strong as this so it says
A	although
C	yeah
C	yeah
A	I like
C	do you? yeah
A	it's less busy
C	yeah
A	but everything's still open you need to live somewhere where everything's open
C	yes
A	I'm gonna have a coffee do you want a coffee at all?
C	no no thanks
A	I'm hungry super hungry
C	they've even found a wooden box
B	yes
C	it must be very cold working there because it's it's mud
B	mm
C	that they're working in what were they about to build there?
B	I don't know
C	well at least they're covered
A	what's that?
C	well this is a Bronze Age place that was burnt down and preserved in silt
A	yeah
C	so even the wood is there
B	would you like a small wine mother?
C	yes
A	mm
C	and there's been an earthquake in Taiwan
A	oh
C	and er
A	oh darling you're so warm and comfy
A	ah these have been very successful
C	oh
B	they're from Skye
A	yes ah
B	well the brown is
A	and they wash and every now and then we wash them don't we? no this one hasn't been washed yet has it?
B	no I'm still not convinced that's real
A	really? oh then that would be trades descriptions
C	are they supposed to be real fur?
A	yeah
C	yeah I always thought the white one was
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	it is
C	and the other one certainly
A	mm
C	in fact apparently the the reverse has been found that people have bought things with collars or whatever
A	yes that are called fake fur
C	as false fur and it's turned
A	yes
C	out that they're real
A	and there's been there's a bit there's a bit of a fuss about that
C	yeah which does seem rather weird
A	cos
C	doesn't it?
A	yes it does
C	and of course people get
A	but people want fake fur
C	yes yeah
A	now
C	yeah
A	I mean fur is lovely
C	yeah I've got a I've got
A	yeah
C	the well a black Persian lamb
A	but you kind of can't well I suppose lamb's not so bad
C	yeah that can't be actually because
A	because
C	you know after we we eat lamb
A	we're eating them anyway
C	yeah exactly so the skin has
A	yeah
C	gotta be used somewhere
A	you might as
C	yeah
A	might as well use it
C	yeah
A	you know oh
C	I suppose if you were wearing a fur coat and you know
A	of an
C	that was something else
A	endangered species
C	then you you could just say this is a Peruvian lamb
A	I mean if you wear a leopard then that's morally
C	yes ah yeah now that's
A	questionable
C	yes that that is actually
A	yeah
C	yes yes
A	now nowadays erm but in the twenties they used to actually kind of almost wear foxes didn't they?
C	oh they did my mother
A	they had a fox around them
C	your mother would have had complete with head
C	my mother my mother
A	yeah
C	had two or three of them actually
A	what a bizarre thing
C	yeah
A	like sort of dead animal round your neck
C	yeah
A	but yeah
C	there it was with its little head
A	yeah yeah
C	yeah
A	has there been any action opposite?
C	no we got quite excited earlier
C	because we actually thought that some people were coming to look at the house and it turned out that they were Jehovah Witnesses or
A	oh
A	bloody Christians
C	er yes exactly yeah
A	I want some action why aren't they coming? it's Saturday
C	no it's not oh yeah it is actually of course it is yeah
A	there's not much going on is there considering
C	no yeah it's er yeah
A	I hope he manages to sell it
C	I think he's
A	he
C	bound to but
A	yeah well I suppose everything takes these things take ages though don't they?
C	well they certainly can yeah
A	but then there's no forward chain on this one there is at least that
C	yeah
A	it's a funny thing a chain isn't it?
C	yes
A	the house chain thing
C	oh it's
A	and it only ends when
C	it's horrendous actually
A	well when does a chain ever
C	end
A	end? if somebody
C	well er it always starts with a
A	had died
C	usually a first time buyer wait a minute we was that yeah
A	so we didn't have a chain no they'd already moved out so I suppose if
C	yeah
A	people move out anyway
C	yeah you you and you were not coming from a chain
A	no that's right
C	if you'd owned
A	yeah
C	then you would have been selling that
A	yeah
C	to somebody else and I suppose
A	and it all has to timed
C	yes oh god yes
A	perfectly
C	and
A	and oh
C	it's very very difficult
A	yeah really difficult
C	actually yeah
A	cos the whole chain's
C	yeah
A	got to be timed
C	yeah cos in actual fact
A	so
C	er
A	but if you chased the if you traced the chain it would go everywhere wouldn't it?
C	yeah well
A	it would be like a house here a house there a house there
C	yeah oh yeah could be all
A	yeah
C	all over the place yeah when we sold number
A	oh that's nice
C	to to introduce
A	yeah
C	and it was for a Sunday morning and er when they er arrived on that Sunday it followed the Saturday when their buyer had a problem with selling their house
A	oh
C	so in actual fact we were going to be exchanging in July
A	yeah
C	and this was the beginning of July
A	yes
C	when there was a problem that
C	rosed it rose its head
A	yeah
C	raised its head
A	yeah
C	over something
A	arose
C	something to do with a path I think actually er
A	oh
C	and it wasn't then until December that we actually exchanging
A	yeah
C	with the with the party
A	yes
C	erm we could
A	but it's so
C	wouldn't exactly be any point in
A	touch and go
C	yeah oh yeah
A	isn't it?
C	yeah
A	right the way through you just never know if it's going to actually happen I suppose
C	mm
A	yeah we were lucky
C	yeah yeah well you were very lucky that you know it was just a straightforward
A	yes it was it was a good first
C	where you're buying a
A	experience really
C	yeah
A	really straightforward
C	yeah
A	erm the only non-straightforward thing was getting sort of gazumped but I don't think that was real
C	do you not?
A	do you remember when someone else? no
C	I need your help
A	and then we ended up paying another thousand
C	yeah
A	I mean what's another
C	well yeah
A	it's ridiculous
C	but er I I mean I don't well I I think that would be extremely er what's the word? unprofessional of
A	oh true
C	of er
A	no I don't know
C	of anybody to do that
A	I don't know
C	yeah
A	that's what
C	mm
A	I'm going to get my coffee
C	right
A	well you think that our gazump wasn't real don't you?
C	have I checked what dear?
A	Rightmove I just wondered if
C	not today er I did yesterday
C	let me just have another look actually
A	but it does seem empty next door
C	it does yes
A	there's no action
C	yes exactly
A	nothing
C	nobody's been
A	yeah
C	er you know and I've been here all morning so
A	no one's coming and going
C	no
A	and there's no car
C	let's just have look
A	but that road looks so much nicer doesn't it?
C	oh yes I mean that's made an absolute
A	yeah it's it's actually made the whole road look
C	look much better
A	more
C	yeah
A	all we need is to get oh the bins are never gonna go are they? I'm not even gonna hope for that
C	oh yeah
A	that door is horrible
B	right the soup's ready we'll just let it get to a more reasonable temperature
C	the
B	you have a seat dear
C	you know the number of houses that are for sale here for half a million in the area an amazing number of them
A	mm are are they going are they
C	er no they're not actually
A	the the gap
C	I'm er I they're all in
A	yeah
B	that that's near
A	that's
C	and that's a a five hundred guide price
A	really?
C	yeah
A	how many bedrooms is that?
C	erm four double bedrooms arranged over three floors you know
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	you see this one they would call four bedrooms I think
C	they would they'd probably call your study
A	they'd have to
C	a bedroom you know
A	well because yeah they would because otherwise it's not a true reflection of the size of the house
C	yeah
A	if they say it's a two bedroomed house that's
C	yeah
A	not going to reflect
C	yeah
A	what it is but it's just that the standard is doing it by how many bedrooms isn't it?
C	yeah
A	but they should almost have a different system shouldn't they than what is it? it's a study it's two
C	yes yes
A	two reception rooms
C	I mean actually I think it's best described as wait a minute one two three reception rooms study two bedrooms
A	yeah
C	and a bathroom you know
A	three reception rooms
A	study
C	yeah
A	but they'd have to call at least one of those reception rooms a bedroom cos of the standard
C	well
A	way that they do it wouldn't they?
C	yeah and I think they'd call downstairs a bedroom
C	yeah
A	sad bedroom wouldn't it?
C	yeah
C	well no no I mean the other room the snug they'd call a bedroom
A	yeah well I mean if you were house sharing
C	yeah
A	this would be a bedroom like
C	yeah oh yeah was
A	that was
C	yeah
A	that was a bedroom
C	yeah yeah
A	yeah it's just that
C	yeah yeah they'd have this I mean they'd probably have this as a bedroom and because it's nearer the bathroom
A	and and
C	and that as a sitting room sitting room
A	yes
C	downstairs sitting room
A	yeah
C	study
A	yeah
C	here bedroom kitchen dining room
A	yeah
C	and upstairs two further bedrooms
A	where you
C	and a bathroom
A	you'd call it well it's at least three bedrooms then
C	yeah
A	isn't it?

A	but that defeats the object
B	would have thought so
A	because they're going to pay
