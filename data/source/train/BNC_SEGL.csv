H	mm

E	mm
B	how do you go about doing that?
I	Google
G	yeah
B	what what
G	yeah yeah oh
F	or an email like
G	mm
C	lovely crumble
F	mm lovely crumble
I	I didn't make it
G	it was going be handmade but then em we had a little accident with the apples so it's now Waitrose made
I	I suspect they're edible but so the bags weren't airtight they were in a brown you know
B	well I think there's
C	so are you having the whole church over for dinner? Rather than actually
G	yeah
I	we could start at A
H	yeah
I	everyone with A
E	eh
I	no
B	what can I think of beginning with A?
I	no more more the whole church
A	mm
G	that would be two hundred and eighty adults
D	are they that many?
G	yeah
C	six months
H	yes
C	I would say if you want to have the whole church over for lunch you have the whole church
I	or we could do a barbeque for them
G	yeah
I	paved it all
G	paved the whole thing
H	grass
I	I can't grow any vegetables
G	there's nothing there's not a single thing out there to grow
D	can you remember what some of the
G	em I dread to think
I	I've never been to their house
G	oh my word it's
D	the  into the paving
H	really?
D	yeah
E	mm
I	really? What rats or something
G	well I remember going there the first week they bought it
D	I don't know bags of white powder
I	really? Wow
G	but when you but they used to have a
H	really?
I	it's not enough to put back so
G	mm
A	what did they do with the drugs that they found and stuff?
G	they contacted the local police station and someone came around to look and said it's insignificant and
B	we're not gonna charge you
B	actually yeah cos presumably if they bought the property the drugs came with the property
G	oh
I	I think I'd have been tempted to just flush it down the loo to be honest
E	mm
D	why? Guilty conscience?
I	em
C	just starts opens a can of worms doesn't it?
I	precisely
H	yeah
C	can just?
G	yeah
I	I mean obviously you'd be particularly stupid to call them in if you were still dealing or something but
D	yeah
I	nonetheless
C	they think em
D	then they'd have your fingerprints all over it
H	yeah
C	they think eighty percent of credit cards have traces of cocaine on them
G	really? No way
E	yeah and most bank notes as well I think
I	yep
A	how do credit cards have traces of cocaine?
C	Cos when someone uses a credit card
C	to line and then they go to the shop
I	chop it up with your credit card
D	and put it in the machine and then you put your machine
A	oh I see
D	your card in the machine
H	mm
D	and used cars as well
A	why?
I	what have?
A	used cars
C	used cars
F	mm
A	I have a used car does that mean
C	people use cars
D	surely only Audi's BMWs and Mercedes
G	is that like one of those statistics where like
C	yeah six yeah six spiders
A	and you eat yeah
G	oh
I	that company we had a company car and it was a BMW with em tinted windows
I	it was slightly scary driving in certain areas in Birmingham
H	yeah
C	I think I'd prefer to have tinted windows in that sort of area
G	ah that's true
C	whereas they would just think it's you they're more likely to hijack or I nearly got hijacked the other day
I	you got hijacked?
C	no no well there were some people doing some spins in their
G	no
A	what did you do?
C	I drove off
C	fast as I could go
I	reversed at the high speed
A	did you have to reverse?
C	no I went round them
G	how weird
A	that's terrifying
G	that's awful isn't it?
A	I I had a really bad incident on the way home from work on the A fourteen
I	people are so stupid
unknown_female	horn
A	horn
G	oh I hate when people do that
A	and I had to slam on my brakes and I was really worried because I had a lorry behind me and he took the next exit off anyway
G	oh
I	people are just so stupid
A	and I don't know what I wasn't doing anything wrong like
G	no no not at all
D	what he overtook you to brake test you?
G	well yeah
A	he he probably wanted me to go in the back of him because if you go into the back of someone you're
C	it's your fault yeah
A	your your it's your fault
I	but then you'd have reported him
A	yeah
E	yeah but then that would have slowed him down as well
A	yeah
D	cars like doing that
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A doesn't blame anyone.	Contradiction
G	yes and then you just go in front
A	yeah
I	this you're allowed to do
G	yeah
C	Don't get me started Ed
C	I I'll happily openly admit I will block a cycle lane if I think it's unsafe for a cyclist to go in front of me
G	yeah
I	that's fine
D	I don't go in front of them
H	yeah no I was
B	you see I'm I'm I'm with you
I	yeah
A	but he could just ram you off the road
H	yeah well I almost happened the other week
B	but he won't
H	Cos I was cycling down and the same taxi pulled out like just suddenly pulled out and then as you know there's a cycle lane
I	unless it's that bloke that was behind you
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker H doesn't have a bicycle.	Contradiction
A	yeah
I	I bet that
H	yeah
I	and say do you realise how badly you were driving? No no no I wasn't I was driving really well and then show them the video
H	yeah
I	and they'd realise
B	no
[ANNOTATION]	All people with driving licence drive well.	Contradiction
H	he would
I	because the recent somewhere just over there the other day I was turning right
E	yeah
I	A white van cut it up and just imagine him saying cyclists are all terrible terrible and you know
F	I have a friend from em Spain and he em he and his fiancée were driving one day in the countryside and eh
I	in Spain or?
[ANNOTATION]	People in Spain do use bicycles.	Entailment
F	in Spain yeah
B	are you serious?
F	yeah yeah
G	yeah
F	he'd have to kill someone at some point
G	oh no
B	but why why did they take him off in a black van that seems a very
H	really dodgy
[ANNOTATION]	The black van was a very old model.	Neutral
F	I know  I know  absolutely mad yeah
B	it doesn't seem  it doesn't seem  to be factual
F	but it is Spain
G	are you sure it wasn't like official? Maybe it was what what's the Spanish one ETA?
F	but like so mad like she didn't get like any explanation of where he was going
G	that's a bit odd
[ANNOTATION]	The van driver apologised and tried to explain himself.	Contradiction
G	do people want to go and grab a seat out a more comfy seat and stuff and em?
F	yeah
B	once I was cycling down Milton Road and just
