A	okay yes that is recording now
A	yes there are a lot
A	so I had some emails erm I you reminded me to get in touch with that market research company
B	oh right okay
A	so I sent them an email to say I'm back
B	right
A	on Sunday did they have any work? and they emailed back within ten minutes and said yes we've got four assignments
A	how many would you like? and then they told me where they are
B	mm
A	so I said yes to three of them
B	oh right that's good
A	cos they're near where I am
B	any food involved?
A	er no coffee shop
B	oh right okay
A	new one erm it's only five minutes from where I am
A	and then the rest look like clothes shops
A	erm well that one you can normally just go in order take it away
B	mm
A	erm afterwards fill in the questionnaire
B	oh that's good isn't it?
A	so it's literally
B	so it's no bother
A	just waiting in the queue for your coffee
B	yes
A	erm then you just have to scan your receipt of course
B	mm
B	yes so do you think there'd be some round here
A	I think there'll be something I don't know what
B	yeah
A	yes
B	so
A	yes that's right
B	good
A	and then the
B	oh right oh right
A	and all the dates
B	oh right
A	but erm I'll just say all of them
B	yes okay that's good well that'll be all helpful to you won't it?
A	yes it will
B	yes I think
A	yes
A	yes
B	yeah I think so yeah
A	yeah
B	and er one of the key jobs I think in any large establishment is the receptionist
A	yeah
B	because the impression you get from meeting in person
A	that's right
B	and some places it's pretty poor
A	yeah
A	yes
A	oh really? mm
B	yes and it's it's not too bad in hospital it could be a lot better
A	yes
B	oh how did you find it at the dentist? the reception
A	er upstairs was fine yes
A	oh right no they were fine er I mean it wasn't very clear what to do
B	no
A	so they gave me this blue form to fill in
B	mm
A	and then I gave it back and it just sort of sat on the counter for ages
B	oh
A	and then about three minutes later she goes oh you have to take that with you well why not say that at the beginning?
B	yes exactly it's those sort of things isn't it?
B	yes
A	I mean she handed it to me so the normal thing would be to hand it back
B	yes
A	that sort of thing
B	yes
A	yes but they were nice enough just a bit inefficient
B	did I tell you when I had my tooth out and I was quite poorly then?
A	oh dear no
B	she couldn't get it out and I was in the chair for getting on for an hour
A	yeah
B	you've had all the injections but it's just stressful still in your mind
A	mm
B	well she finished and I got to get out of the chair out of the door and then felt really faint and I was sort of clutching the wall cos I was afraid I was gonna go
A	yeah
B	and the girl could see I was
A	oh that's nice
B	and after a few minutes I said
A	oh that's nice
B	yes and then I sat in the waiting room
A	perhaps they were worried you would sue
A	yes
B	trying not to make a fuss and really it's playing havoc with you
A	yes
B	so
A	yes
B	so she got she said she thinks there was a bit left and then it became infected so I had to take antibiotics for a while
B	but when she saw me the second time she said I think I would advise you not that we don't go for surgery because she said it's extremely unpleasant and she said if you're lucky
A	ah well that's good
B	yes and
A	yeah
B	but I think the dentist is very
A	yes cos no one likes it
B	no
A	yeah
B	there's loads of butterflies now isn't there?
A	yeah there's loads isn't there?
B	the birds were quiet weren't they this morning?
A	perhaps it's too hot for them
B	yes
A	it is very warm isn't it?
B	yes it is yes it said twenty-four today so
A	yes
B	don't know what it's like in Scotland do you?
A	no
A	but it's always colder up there isn't it?
B	yes well it's probably for him he's probably thinking it's marvellous
A	yes my students went there
B	ah
A	and they came back saying how freezing it was and I told
A	colder than here though anyway
B	yes well I guess it's like if here people say it's very wet in this part of
B	and it might be true but I don't really want to hear it
A	no
A	at least you don't have to water the garden
B	no and I also think it's wetter in
A	yeah it's cos of the moor
B	yeah because when I come back
A	yeah
B	but then people in
A	mm
B	which again is probably true
A	yes
B	and you know they'd've only been planted
A	oh right mm
B	eight years say before that so it's good
A	oh they were planted before you got here?
B	yes I
A	yes
B	and I think they were
A	ah right yes they did they did do a good job actually
A	yes
A	or somewhere else
B	or they were market gardeners before I got the impression it was before they came here
A	ah yes it's quite a way isn't it to the markets from here?
B	yes
A	yes but you can see it's been well laid out
B	yes I think we're lucky so we could get it back
A	yes cos
B	I think it's good
A	it's a sensible garden how they've done it
B	yes
A	its not too many beds is it?
B	no and it's interesting isn't it?
A	yes
B	and I think that little bit through there's very good
A	yes I like that
B	yeah
A	what did you think of that gardening programme yesterday?
B	erm I thought it was quite interesting mm you didn't?
A	well it was quite interesting but it was a bit of a sob story
B	yes it was
A	it was a bit annoying
B	yes yes
A	yes
A	yes but I mean you could find hundreds of sob stories couldn't you? and do their garden
B	yes
A	yes that's useful
B	and how they create a haven
A	I don't think mine can have that many things in it though can it?
B	no but you can make it absolutely beautiful
A	yeah you could have a patio and erm
B	yeah yes yes you could would you like a patio?
A	I'm not going to cos it's
B	right
A	all they're going to do is put in one paving slab outside the
B	oh right okay yeah
A	but they said you could extend it
B	yes okay and it's all for later isn't it? you need to
A	yes
B	just get going
B	who said this?
B	oh
B	yes
B	and she's this one in Oman?
A	yes
B	ah yes okay
A	older in her fifties
B	right okay is she on her own?
A	yes
A	she was married for years very unhappily
B	yes
A	had two children and her husband was a diplomat
B	oh right
A	yes and travelled the world but then it sounds idyllic but actually it's very difficult for the woman cos they can't get proper work she could only work in the embassy
B	mm
A	and then she was always sort of a secretary but she's very bright so it would've been boring for her
B	yeah and I think if you are living
A	yes
B	and you get used to doing your own thing and you don't stick them together when you get together
A	and he was progressing
A	and also she's not one of those society ladies and she said a lot of diplomats' wives you know they're all about the
B	mm
A	you know they think they're something
B	oh yes
A	and she's not into all that
B	no
A	you know posturing and
B	ah yes
A	dinner parties so when the children grew up they got divorced and then
B	ah yes
A	she's very good she
B	yes
A	small house in Australia she's Australian on the coast
B	oh that's nice
A	erm and she retrained she did counselling
B	oh did she? okay
A	yoga she's a yoga instructor
B	oh that's good
A	and she's a teacher
B	yes
A	so now she's teaching and saving some money
B	oh that's good
A	it's probably her pension
B	yes
A	and she's got that house to go back to
B	and does she know people there?
A	not really she's got family there
B	oh
A	an elderly mother
B	oh
A	which she's not close to
B	no
A	but she's very friendly she'll make friends
B	yes where are her children then?
A	erm I think one's in
A	yes
B	with everybody in their different places
A	mm
B	and she's like cos I asked her what her job was one day and she said well I never really had one
A	no
A	yes
B	but she said the modern wives it's very different
A	oh right
B	a lot of them don't move around they
A	yes
B	and
A	yes
A	yes that's right cos pilots' wives have always had to do that haven't they? they couldn't move with their husband
B	right
A	but then those pilots that I worked with are all divorced
B	oh yes and they have affairs and things don't they?
A	yes that's right
B	yes well that's
A	yes it wasn't very good
B	no that's the other thing
A	and they weren't happy
B	no
A	they'd got you know this lovely job
B	mm
A	lots of money but they were miserable
B	yes
A	they were all unhappy
B	yes and it's difficult isn't it? if they're meeting up and they women very trapped
A	yeah
A	yes
A	no that is tricky
B	so they wanted to
A	and also unsettling for the children as well
B	yes
A	to keep moving them
B	yes
A	school after school after school
B	yes yes
A	erm
B	that's it
A	got no roots have they?
B	no or go to a boarding school you might not want that
A	yeah and expensive as well boarding schools
B	well they pay for it don't they?
A	oh do they?
B	yeah
A	oh that's good
B	yes
A	yeah it's difficult
A	mm
B	and she was going to stay in
A	oh right
B	you know cos there are difficult other difficulties aren't there?
A	yes
B	I'm not sure
A	er so if anyone says over the next few months that they're turning anything out
A	you'll have to
B	ah yes okay
A	tell them to hold it for me please
B	I
B	well it's good I told you to
A	not tea caddy the containers
B	container yes
A	for the tea
B	don't you call them tea caddy?
A	tea caddy isn't that just like a tea cosy?
B	I don't think so
A	oh
B	I think it's what you store tea in
A	is it? oh I didn't know that
B	yes a tea cosy's just a tea cosy
A	oh
A	yeah it's complicated
B	yeah
A	no
B	lessons
A	no
B	mm
A	not as big?
B	erm I don't mind them not being as big but they chip easily there's two or three have got a chip
A	ah
B	and I haven't had them long and then the sugar one doesn't keep the sugar dry
A	oh that's annoying
B	really annoying
A	mm why did you change them?
B	cos I was tired of them
A	mm
B	because I
A	the kitchen?
B	yes the cupboards and the
A	oh
B	the
A	I like that oven
B	erm yeah I quite like it but I think we
A	got lots of character they'd be expensive to buy
B	yes they're very dear
A	yes?
A	oh lovely
unknown_female	quite a big one
A	oh I haven't got shoes on otherwise I'd come
B	erm but we decided you know so it doesn't need doing leave it for another ten years which is sensible cos you can go on forever can't you?
A	yes
B	what I would like but I don't think we'll ever have it done is just to open all this up so it was all glass
A	ah
B	that'd be really nice
A	yes
B	yeah
A	probably not
B	cos another thing I thought of doing but I don't think it's worth the expense is blocking off the door into the lounge to make it more private
A	yes
B	and then making the kitchen bigger which I'd quite like and opening it into the dining room with an archway
A	ah right
B	but I don't know how much you'd gain in the end by doing all that cos
A	no
A	yes I don't think it is
B	and you're private in the kitchen so
A	no
B	that's it you sort of could spend a few thousand to actually have not that much benefit
A	that's true
B	and there were erm plans for an
A	oh really?
B	mm
A	oh it's big enough isn't it the house?
B	well it is well yes I mean
A	for two people?
B	oh yes it's big enough and you'd er spoil the lounge I think
A	yes
B	I think that was the pity because you lose the light don't you? with and that's lovely that lounge
A	yeah so that
B	yes that's what I mean you spent thousands but not really any benefit that's it
B	no I would
A	there's plenty
B	yeah I wouldn't mind a bigger even lighter kitchen though and
A	yes
A	no
B	having that door was a good help anyway
A	yes
B	have you seen some houses now where instead of having doors like this
A	mm?
B	it they literally sort of roll back? so the whole wall
A	oh right no I haven't seen that
B	goes back so
A	yeah that's good
B	yes it won't be as good will it?
A	no
B	no
A	it's never going to be as good and security
B	yes
A	I mean no one's going to break through the wall are they?
B	no they're not
A	but that kind of door
B	yes
A	even if it's double-glazed
B	yes
A	it's not going to be that difficult to break through
B	no and the thing is a lot of the time it's winter isn't it?
A	yes
B	well exactly and there is
A	there's no difference
B	no and there is a lot of light in that lounge isn't there?
A	found a frog?
unknown_female	yes
A	in the compost heap?
unknown_female	yes
A	oh right well that's nice
unknown_female	I've just refilled it so I I from the pile and then
A	ah yes
unknown_female	the top the top of the other one over
A	oh that's good
unknown_female	yeah
B	mm
A	might find a snake one day in there
B	oh yes you might
B	yes
A	cos they like to keep warm
B	well that would certain save me ten pounds a year on compost but it's also
A	it is madness
A	but it is a bit of a nuisance to dig them out
B	is it?
A	well you have to remove the top third usually to get at the compost
B	ah right okay
A	but now dad's done that
B	okay
A	and if he wanted to he could do the other one take the top third off and then empty
B	okay
A	empty the other one
[ANNOTATION]	The compost is at the top.	Contradiction
B	yes
A	but anyway it's good
B	so when what year do you think we should open the
A	oh yes
A	now you've had a trial run you know about the wind
B	oh right okay
A	yes and maybe you could go in for those competitions where you grow the biggest something
B	ah yes okay
A	biggest pumpkin
B	yes yes
A	I still think you should grow pumpkins
A	cos they are amazing you know they grow over a foot overnight?
A	not the pumpkin the the thing it grows on
B	do they really?
A	well more than a foot I've seen them grow over a foot in a night
[ANNOTATION]	Pumpkins tend to grow more if you plant them next to tomatoes.	Neutral
A	pumpkin soup you'd like
B	oh right okay
A	you like carrot soup don't you?
B	yes
A	same sort of thing
A	little bit sweet
B	yes okay and when do you think I we should open the gardens you know for the flowers and and trees and things generally? next year?
[ANNOTATION]	They don't like vegetable soups, especially carrot soup.	Contradiction
A	well I think next year
B	what should we charge?
A	oh
B	okay and I
[ANNOTATION]	B never thought about charging anything for the gardens.	Contradiction
A	yes ah yes that's good they could pay extra for that
B	mm
A	yes
unknown_female	erm
A	ah that's good
unknown_female	filled it up
A	is it full?
[ANNOTATION]	Some animals look for warmth.	Entailment
unknown_female	yes but I I and I've done layers with er cardboard
A	oh that's good yes
unknown_female	and erm I expect in
A	yes
B	it'd be interesting to see who would come
A	yes
A	I think all the old women would come cos they're nosy
B	yeah that's it they'd come up to see what it's like
A	yes
B	do you like this bracelet
A	yes it's pretty
B	I'm not sure if I bought it in Morocco I think
A	oh it's very nice
A	oh right
B	now I ought to get on with the dinner
A	yes I think I need to go in quite hot
B	yes it is
A	yes
B	yeah
A	that'll be fun with the hard hats
B	yes
A	so you said we're having lamb for lunch?
B	yes
A	that's nice lamb chops?
B	yes
A	oh lovely I like them
B	are you going to listen to
B	yes
A	erm well I'll stop it now shall I?
B	oh well yes if we're not gonna be talking any more
A	no little bit pointless
A	oh that's twenty minutes
B	was it? that's interesting interesting how long you can talk for as well isn't it?
A	yes
