B	yeah
A	definitely need it in my life
B	um
B	what could it have been about? Um
A	legs?
B	I did see
A	oh did he
B	it's quite funny that you two have both like given your approval
A	yep
B	he said he reminded him of
A	oh
B	which I thought was a bit um strange
A	I think
B	yeah he is
A	mm
B	I couldn't imagine dating
A	yeah
B	quite different
A	yeah
B	mm
A	I remember now
B	oh really?
A	little fuckhead
B	mm
A	so I told him I was seeing
B	mm
A	and I was like yeah she's fine
B	mm
A	it's nothing to worry about
B	your lies?
A	yes
B	right
A	um
B	oh yeah
A	and I've decided that I won't do that because imagine if he's a killer
B	you're in
A	I'll be in
B	home of the death
A	yes
B	well I really would not recommend going
A	so
A	yes
B	okay
A	mm
B	that's very sensible
A	oh crap no I haven't
B	mhm
A	so I said really sorry busy busy blah blah
B	mm
A	thought I'm not gonna tell Jord that though am I
B	nice
A	and then I thought I'd rub it in a bit more
B	nice
A	and he said oh what type of gig is it? I said some indie rock something or other
B	nice
A	but the view should be good from his shoulders
B	huh
A	you win some you lose some
B	nice
A	yeah
A	and I was like
B	oh that's funny
A	no way
B	oh
A	mm
B	mm
A	as in you're not doing anything
B	sounds shit yeah
A	that sounds shit
B	mm
A	um
B	mm
A	as if it was a dig
B	mm
A	and he was like no not really
B	mm
A	so that was the end of conversation
B	mm
A	not a long they've you know they've not met up a lot of times
B	mm
A	would you travel four hours to see someone and then just sit in their
B	sit in
A	living room with their housemate?
B	no
A	once
B	once? She's been here once?
A	I think this  I think this  is visit number two
B	yeah
A	or
B	yeah
A	mm
B	there's a night out or there's a movie or
A	and when he goes up there the only thing they seem to do is go to the student union where she works
B	mm
A	Cos she can get tickets
B	sounds quite a boring existence really
A	doesn't it
B	but maybe that's what they both
A	want
B	want
A	mm
B	but I
A	and he doesn't have to
B	it's easy with her
A	try with her
B	yeah exactly
A	mm mm
B	he's she's not demanding that
A	which sounds mental to me
B	yeah
A	bam
B	there's nothing there
A	no
B	to go straight into being old couple
A	grannies
B	mm
A	you want the fun dates and
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	mm
A	and like a couple of times you know to just stay in the house is fine
B	yeah
A	and I thought well more fool her
B	mm
A	ever I must seriously like him
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	game over
A	game over
B	maybe she's got nothing to compare it to
A	she's twenty-six
B	well
A	mm
B	the prize turkey in the box
A	mm
B	or whatever that is
A	yeah
B	um
A	yes
B	yes does seem a bit weird
A	yes
B	going for a run
A	yeah
B	in the
A	no
B	external
A	yep
B	ooh
A	in the outside world
B	well I can give
A	that'll be awesome
A	er four
B	okay
A	if he's not it's okay
B	mm
A	come another time
B	mm
A	um
B	mhm
A	and see if I can maybe slow my pace down a bit so I can keep it up
B	mm
A	stopping
B	mm
A	um
B	um
A	I think
B	you need one of those like
A	oh
B	the yard
A	trundle-wheel
B	the trundle-wheel
A	the trundle-wheel
B	that's what you need
B	you would look like a a really special person
A	yeah I would
B	in fact er they might actually arrest you
B	take you to the mental home
A	yeah
B	sounds good
A	yeah
B	that's a really good look for you
A	but I was thinking I might've done it in seventeen minutes you know
B	but not
A	when I on the treadmill
B	mm
A	I start off pretty slow
B	mhm
A	and clocked the road
B	mm
A	so maybe I just hammered it a bit too much
B	it's more  it's more  difficult to do that isn't it
A	mm
B	it is  it is  tougher I think when you're outdoors
A	so but it's fine
B	mm
A	it'll get that
B	and that's all you can do
A	mm
B	you have done
A	yeah
B	you've been running
A	and a plus as well is that that's two miles
B	nice
A	well it's  well it's  two point two but I walk down the street so we'll say two miles
B	mm
A	so at least I'll I'll
B	mm
A	the the distance
B	is that what they're gonna make you do? Are you gonna run outside or on the treadmill?
A	when I do my fitness test?
B	yeah
A	my first one that'll just be in the on the treadmill
B	yeah
A	job's a good 'un
B	two-day death
A	which er obviously is its official name
B	as it's known in the business
A	yeah
B	mm
A	that are gonna ace it
B	hmm
A	and the thing that I don't get is they give you that table of the different age brackets
B	yeah
A	if you're over twenty-six you can't apply
B	is that  is that  not that's for officers then? It's not for for ratings?
A	it's for everybody
B	yeah
A	no
B	I thought it was just officers who had to be under twenty-six
A	oh
B	I dunno
A	my friend
B	has he got a degree?
A	yeah
A	that's probably quite probably true
B	and what you've gotta remember about all those eighteen-year-olds that you see they are the cannon fodder
A	yeah
B	and they're not the ones who've got the brain cells
A	that's it
B	that's it
A	yeah
B	can be thick as two short planks
A	I mean I was thinking about it logically
B	mm
A	even if you're not quite cutting the mustard or you're coming bottom of the class they want to see that you're a that you're a really motivated determinate person
B	that you're passionate about it
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	you know
A	so you know even if  even if  I go there and I struggle as long as I throw myself into it
B	mm
A	full for two days then
B	that's all they can ask for
A	yeah
A	Cos they say that you know you don't have to be super super fit
B	mm
A	and I watched this video on their their training
B	yeah
A	and the guy said you know when when people come here some people really struggle
B	okay
A	it's our job to get you fit no matter what level you're at
B	oh
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	if you're by the twelve weeks by the end of the twelve weeks if you're not fit enough it's our problem
B	nice
A	so
B	I think I told you wasn't it my driving instructor was like that
A	yeah
B	he really felt responsible for the people he was teaching
A	yeah
B	it's really clear now
A	mm
B	that's really the attitude you should have
A	mm
B	and that and that's encouraging as well
A	yeah
B	this or you're out
A	yeah
B	they'll take a lot of things into consideration
A	mm
B	which is quite good in a way
A	yeah
B	mm
A	whereas people that find it difficult to think strategically
B	mm
A	it it must be difficult to to teach yourself that
B	yeah
A	unless you can find someone to give you er problems to work  to work  through
B	mm
A	whereas at least that bit I know I can already do
B	yeah
A	and the fitness thing's something quite hands-on that you can physically kinda change
B	mm
A	so I'd rather
B	yeah
A	just have that to worry about than
B	yeah that's something you can quite easily remedy in those ten weeks because you're gonna be doing you'll be working out every single day
A	yeah
B	it's gonna be a fucking killer
A	ain't it gonna be a killer
B	but you are gonna be a machine
A	yeah
B	cracking peanuts in your butt cheeks
A	yes
B	you're gonna be unbelievably ripped
A	yep
B	oh amazing
A	I'm allowed to come home to celebrate aren't I?
B	yeah but but Dartmouth actually is lovely
A	oh is it?
B	really nice
A	oh well you can come to Dartmouth then
B	yeah
A	okay
B	and they have well they have a ball
B	nice dresses
A	huh
B	you'll you'll
A	I get to wear a dress?
B	well I guess you wear your navy uniform
A	get a new
B	well only because when
A	oh but it's
B	posh stuff
A	oh no but er
B	but the girls stuff probably is really ugly
A	yeah
B	but I don't know  I don't know  if you have to wear it or whether the boys think this is really nice I'll wear this rather than buy a suit
A	mm
B	whereas if you're a girl you're gonna wanna wear a dress
A	dress
B	yeah
A	Don't fancy wearing like trousers and shirt though
B	no I imagine it is
A	and a hat
B	some sort of dress
A	no
B	hat's not okay
A	oh
B	and it's pretty swish
A	yeah
B	obviously they were wearing lovely dresses
A	damn it
B	I'm gonna laugh in your face
B	I'm just putting it out there
A	yeah
B	Cos you'll have a ripped body
A	if if that is the case I'm just gonna parade around in my shorts and nothing else
B	do it  do it
A	that's what I'll do
B	that's probably what you will
A	I'll get a matching bra with a
B	yep
A	done
B	sounds fine
A	and I'm not sure my if my family go they're gonna appreciate it
B	they're gonna love it
B	they're gonna love that
A	I think I might have to
B	I feel
A	have to ask
B	what when you're on the ship?
A	yes
B	I don't know if you can take all the shoes
A	mm
B	circular stairs
A	yeah
B	you will die
B	and I'm pretty sure that might be some sort of sackable offence
B	yeah
A	it was a tragic
B	he died nobly
A	the shoe can be buried with him
A	and I'll be like no not my shoe
B	dig up the coffin
B	oh man alive
A	God
B	man alive
B	it's great though
A	so my twenty-fifth
B	well I
A	sh
B	I don't know if anybody is really
A	yeah
B	but it's an achievement now
A	yeah
B	you know you and really you should be really
A	obviously
B	obviously what's gonna happen this year
B	note to self join the navy
B	only because you came back from your Christmas and you were like yeah it's really nice I got these presents  my cousin and by the way I'm joining the navy
B	that's what happened
B	navy?
B	right
A	I said to my dad I need to get an answer to this question
B	mm
A	and all I can reply is shits and giggles
B	yeah
A	there is no logic
B	well I mean
A	I just wanna do it
B	challenge
A	I think it's the team thing I like
B	yeah
A	like none of these shitty people stabbing each other in the back and getting one up on each other
B	right
A	I hate  I hate I hate  it
B	yeah
B	absolutely
A	but apparently
B	well I guess your problem is you're gonna find that in any anywhere you work anything you do you are gonna find people like that it it's it's learning to deal with those people I suppose
A	mm
B	you know
A	we could push them overboard
B	you want to
B	I think if you work in the navy you probably can actually just go round boiling people's heads
A	yeah
B	to do that
A	I think that's probably allowed
B	that's probably fine
A	oh yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah something ridiculous
B	so there probably is some sort of law that says you can actually boil someone's head if they're a tool
A	yeah
B	tool status
A	I think that's fair
A	the airport thing
B	oh yeah
A	at Stansted Airport
B	mm
A	unfortunately miles away the other side of the airfield
B	is it actually just down the road? Are we just parking at the end of
B	right
A	private company that use the runways
B	okay
A	um and our the sales director
B	nice
A	if not we'll call a taxi
B	oh fine
A	um
B	nice
A	and if not then get a taxi
B	that's pretty awesome
A	yeah
B	short little taxi ride's
A	we'll just
B	not gonna be a problem
A	yeah
B	but we're coming back at a reasonable time on the Saturday aren't we
A	yeah
A	huh
B	well done you
A	yeah
B	Good to have contacts
A	that was good wasn't it
B	that's really good
A	yeah
B	Good find
B	that's awesome
A	yeah
B	Cos it's about forty-five minutes away isn't it
A	yeah
B	do you wanna take
A	I'll take
B	okay
A	I'm used to driving that way so
B	okay
A	um
B	Good
A	when I was in my room
B	Good
A	managed to do thirteen sit ups
B	oh my God
A	twice
B	that's really impressive
A	yeah
B	it's really really good
A	I mean it hurts now
B	yeah
A	I'm not gonna try it again today
B	yeah
A	oh
B	and he was doing the one where you have to like
A	yeah
B	he was like making me do that
A	yeah
B	and he'd
A	yeah
B	and he said you've gotta hit your head against my hand
A	yeah
B	so it's basically like he's here with his hand and you're doing that
A	yeah
B	twenty times
A	oh
B	my brain can't comprehend this
A	yeah
B	you're coming together
A	that's hard
B	it's really hard
A	the other hard one that they used to make us do which is a piss take
B	is that when you lie down and kick your feet?
A	no
B	yeah
A	but balancing apart
B	yeah
A	so your feet can't touch the floor
B	mm
B	yeah
A	like how are you supposed to keep balance like that?
B	yeah
A	I don't know
B	on your  on your on your  tail basically
A	frig
B	when I used to do Kettlebell that's what they made you do
B	ah ah
A	yeah
B	actually broken your leg
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	ah
B	but they do  they do  run quite far
A	they do
B	and it's the centre of town
A	yeah
B	seven o'clock at night or something
A	yeah
B	still
A	I don't want to join the running clubs
B	yeah
A	line toer
B	it's difficult to know whether it's you know and I mean people always say oh all abilities welcome
A	no
B	you don't know
A	yeah
B	well it's like when we did language classes isn't it
A	really?
B	I'm like I don't know
A	yeah
B	this was before I went to Cuba
A	yeah
B	it really pissed me off
A	what are you doing in the basic class?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	and you're gonna take longer
A	yeah I hate that
A	I'm talking to a pretty fit guy in a minute
B	yeah?
A	well well I'm getting a bit confused
B	they all sort of blur into one don't they
A	yeah
B	fine
A	um
B	mhm
A	um
B	which one was
A	yep
B	mm
A	Cos he trains the army people to fight
B	yeah
A	ah ah ah
B	drink? That was what he did
A	heads up
B	yeah
A	heads up
B	they're mental
A	yeah
B	mm
A	he's quite amusing
B	oh God
A	that he owns
B	mm
A	then he's flogging it
B	Don't investigate that
A	no
B	no
A	Don't need to know
A	there was like serious Vader issues there
B	aw
A	he was like yeah do it
B	shit
B	few issues there
A	yeah
B	mm
A	so I gave him my number and I was like yeah that's fine
B	mm
A	didn't hear anything from him
B	mm
A	and that was on Saturday night
B	mm
A	nothing at all
B	mm
A	I sent him a message saying tut so you'll never guess what I gave this interesting guy my phone number and doesn't even bother to ring me
B	rude
B	mm
A	and he was like oh I might be able to arrange something for this week or this weekend
A	that's quite amusing
B	oh I like the sound of him
A	Good question
B	wow
A	another one
B	they all they've all got the same name
A	yeah
A	told me he was
A	and this other guy
B	mm
A	you've got the same type of sense of humour with them and stuff
B	mm
A	he was like oh I'm a bit bored with this now
B	rank
A	and I didn't know what it was
B	oh
A	and I was like what are you talking about?
B	aw
A	yeah
B	mm
A	ah
B	mm
A	he was like yeah
B	yeah
A	you wanna keep fishing
B	yeah
A	and he was like oh right fair enough sorry
B	mm
A	um
B	oh
A	so I laid that and he was like okay
B	yeah
A	why would you bother?
B	well I think cos on er most of these sites girls probably are a bit weird
A	yeah
B	a bit sane and you know likes a laugh they probably think oh I'm onto a winner there
B	see where it takes me
A	yeah
A	oh I stopped texting him
B	oh
A	yeah
B	probably for the best
A	he carried on doing the same thing and I just thought do I really wanna go through this? Probably really don't wanna go through with it
B	and sometimes it feels like you're being
A	sounds like a great idea
B	and you're being hounded as well
A	yeah
B	like I was chatting to this guy
A	he seemed er too much
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	turns you off even more
A	oh
B	Cos he plays rugby for the college
A	yeah
B	um
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	whatever
[ANNOTATION]	both speakers go to university	Neutral
A	it's all pressures it
B	really pressurized
A	yeah
B	you know so like no I'm not really into this anymore
A	and it's sounds daft but like if you like someone you're gonna bring them back here anyway
A	if he's liked someone enough to wanna do that
A	then it's not like you're taking it off the cards
B	mm
A	it's just you're not making it an
B	exactly
A	yeah
B	taking that pressure off you
A	what happens if you don't like them?
B	yeah
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	they have had many romantic experiences	Neutral
