A	yeah
B	oh good
A	yes
B	that's very good
A	oh
B	yeah
A	fricking awesome
B	yep
A	that's normal
B	he decided that was the time to A eat dinner um
A	huh
B	when I was cooking dinner
A	yes
B	and B have a really long lengthy conversation with the PPI people
A	are you  are you  being serious?
B	huh?
A	are you being serious?
B	that's what he was doing
A	oh my God
B	mis-sold PPI?
A	really?
B	yeah
A	that's what he was doing?
B	that's what he was doing
A	holy fuck
B	because he's such a retard
A	yeah
B	you've let them start
A	yeah
B	well anyway that's what he was doing
A	fuck off
B	nightmare
A	what?
B	somewhere
A	who's
B	whereas if they were
A	who's supposed to make them?
B	well interestingly er interestingly enough the head of marketing left in November
A	and really need
B	to call a meeting about it they'd be like he's like well we'll just wait for the new person
A	what?
B	huh
A	yeah
B	and they know that it's bad
A	they could just employ me
B	mm
A	bosh bosh
B	absolutely
A	that'd be great
B	well they're supposed to be going through this
A	they could just pay me for a little while and then
B	you could be like a consultant
A	yeah
B	mm
B	mm
A	would basically make me the same wages I could do sat there
B	oh
A	no
B	well that's the thing
A	huh
B	in order to introduce new um process review
A	yeah
B	they weren't
A	yeah
B	they're not gonna do it
A	doesn't matter
B	you're still gonna have to hold their hand
A	which
B	rather than being proactive
A	is extra work for you
B	yeah
A	that's you doing your own job and then making sure somebody else does theirs
B	yeah
A	if they don't do their own job they're fired
B	well yeah
A	yeah
B	certainly not through marketing
A	yeah
B	responsibility
A	two thousand books?
B	two thousand books
A	gosh
B	oh don't get me started
A	oh
B	but in my head I forgot that they would tax me on that
A	yeah
B	and then I thought well er well they'll have taxed me
A	not two hundred quid though
B	but shit yeah
A	benefits
B	huh fuck me
A	it's
B	A hundred pounds  hundred pounds
A	that can't be right
B	well er
A	that can't be right
B	I've chased it up with our payroll and I've said have you charged me at forty percent rather than twenty percent? Um and they said yeah we've charged you at twenty percent
A	no
B	so it comes out at forty percent
A	oh my God
B	I mean what the hell? So that really fucked me off
A	that's horrendous
B	Cos er I mean I you know I'm not really relying on it but it would've been really good
A	yeah
B	Cos I need to get out of my overdraft this year
A	that is such a pisser
B	mm
A	huh
B	do they?
A	from this year alone
B	okay
A	yeah
B	um and I got a rebate
A	God
B	to pull their finger out
A	it's such a piss-take
B	yeah
A	actual piss-take
B	you know
A	I know
B	they're the tax office
A	so I've got them to contact
B	huh
A	yeah
B	what?
A	something's happened
B	yeah
A	which are both at their overdraft limit
B	yeah
A	since I've taken this job
B	mm
A	it's two hundred I paid two hundred and fifty off it so they don't really give a crap until this next September or something
B	mm
A	fine
B	yeah
A	interest on it
B	tut
A	account
B	oh yeah
A	and we didn't know what it was
B	per day?
A	per day right
B	mm
A	and never once have I been charged per day like that
B	they can change the terms though
A	no
B	no
A	I haven't had anything
B	and not told you
A	and not told me
B	Cos they just basically write to me and tell me they'd
A	really?
B	yeah
A	and then flip it
B	and then flip it
A	yeah
B	over to interest
A	yes
B	and then one day they just wrote to me and said right you've got
A	and said no
B	no you've gotta pay
A	oh shit
B	and they charge you twenty-five pounds arrangement fee
A	for doing it?
B	yeah
A	I know
B	mm
A	saying they're gonna do
B	yeah
A	they can see my outgoings
B	they've got no morals mate
A	they know
B	mm
A	that there is no way on God's earth that I can afford to pay out a hundred and fifty quid
B	mm
A	plus the whatever er whatever they're gonna whack on this month
B	yeah
A	another a hundred and fifty quid
B	yeah
A	Natwest
B	yeah
A	no
B	my mum left HSBC for that exact same reason
A	yeah
B	she didn't have any money coming in and er they were just like oh yeah well that's the terms of the agreement
A	it's just bullshit
B	well er it used to be that you could claim back your bank charges because they were illegal
A	yeah
B	in your contract
A	I know
B	that says you can't
A	I know
B	but
A	Cos they owed me about three grand and I never got it back
B	I know
A	no
B	you're on a very basic salary
A	yeah
B	end of your overdraft
A	I'm just gonna write her a letter
A	and just see see what response I get back
B	mm
A	if it ever comes back on me I can say look I I tried to do the responsible thing and sort this out
B	yeah
A	Cos I don't know what the hell you did but you knowing
B	mm
A	it's so frustrating
B	mm
A	that they they've done it knowing there's no chance of me paying it back
B	absolutely
A	what the fuck? You can't drop someone in the shit like that
B	yeah
A	after
B	well they will just take the money
A	yeah
B	that's the thing
A	they just take it
B	they'll just keep taking it
A	and the worst part is I think
B	you'll get more and more in debt
A	how it actually happened in the first place was that they tried to cash a cheque right
B	mm
A	which bounced
B	mm
A	legally they're not allowed to reclaim for that cheque because they are aware then
B	okay
A	and they did it twice again
B	did they?
A	I think that's where
B	oh right
A	all this started spiralling from
B	yeah
A	mm
B	so they say you know maybe maybe you would want to write a an initial letter and then write them again and say well actually it's good isn't it
A	yeah
B	it's not been  it's not been  picked up
A	oh good
B	so today was
A	I've had one of them today
B	bit spec
A	yep
B	and it turns out
A	oh fuck
B	so fucked off
A	uh
B	so now
A	these people need smashing in the face
B	yeah
A	no
B	they really don't care
A	yeah
B	yeah right
A	yeah
B	so young
A	huh
B	Don't give me that shit
A	oh they anger me
B	you just  you just you just  know they're lying to you
A	yeah
B	constantly
A	yeah
B	so and of course they don't collect on the weekends cos that'd be you know
A	oh
B	helpful customer service
A	Cos everybody else is off work
B	yeah
A	and the majority of the population
B	to give you my phone
A	Will be off home ready to give phones when
B	yeah
A	when required
B	oh yeah
A	yeah
B	oh yeah
A	no it's not
B	it's probably not standard if you can't hear me
A	yep
B	that's probably not standard is it you fucking retard
A	twat
B	oh huh
A	I spoke to my
B	your high school? About getting your certificates?
A	yep
B	right
A	I then called actually with the intention to ask them
B	yeah
A	at the authorities for when they
B	mm
A	er to oh we do have your A-level results
B	oh
A	no way
A	no
A	yes we do have them
B	mm
A	right
A	painfully dim
A	it was awful
B	oh
A	huh
B	really slow
A	yeah
B	huh
A	er I think she was wearing a brace or what
B	mm
A	no
A	yeah
B	et cetera
A	so she first she told me that that would be they've got other priorities basically than to write me a letter
B	mm
A	Cos of their own students now that are doing stuff
B	mm
A	I will write the letter for you
B	yeah
A	just print it on headed paper
B	mm
A	I'll just check with a colleague
B	huh
A	yes
A	that I should er the only way I could get
B	oh this isn't your mum? This is
A	oh no
B	another
A	this is another
A	I remember her
B	but you live here
A	but I live here
A	but that's okay
A	what? I said do you want me to drive four hours across the country
A	so because you can't walk down the corridor?
B	that's ridiculous
A	no
B	mm
A	and let let her explain to me why that's the case
B	yeah
A	Cos that's absolute bullshit
B	yeah
A	I said look can we have this conversation by e-mail? Because then at least I've got it in paper what you've said
B	mm
A	and then if all else fails at life at your end
A	then
B	yeah
A	she said yeah that's fine
A	we do have them?
A	you've told me you don't have them
A	then she said
B	do you think she's the same person you've been talking to?
A	I know it is  I know it is
A	that's the worst part
B	was it someone else?
A	I recognize the voice
B	it's always her?
A	and she said but they're in an archive
A	in an archive
A	paper archive
A	I'm sure you can imagine
B	of course
A	um that there are
A	yes
B	but surely it's in some sort of order?
B	I mean they're not just
A	I don't think so
B	scattered around
A	okay so don't worry
B	mm
A	in the letter write thank you for requesting your GCSE results
B	mm
A	bluh bluh bluh
B	being shit
A	we'll give you
A	due to us not actually having an archive
B	it's in a shed
A	in an old coal-mine in Yorkshire
A	then
B	oh man
A	give me a
A	I though oh my God
B	your life is
A	hold she's
B	yeah
A	forever
B	and by the time the next you speak to her she'll
B	be like no we haven't got your results
A	and so I made her
B	okay
A	and then she told me huh
B	where is the archives?
A	yeah
A	I said oh
A	I said it must be pretty massive
A	um
B	it's gonna take you two months to trek through it
A	yeah
A	of paper I will be in this position chasing things in January
B	mm
A	you don't have a choice whether or not to provide me with that
B	mm
A	if you don't give it to me as I request it the Royal Navy will request it from you officially
B	mm
A	and then you'll be obliged to do it
B	mm
A	right
B	yeah
A	got it in writing now
B	well at least you've got it in writing
A	I actually debated driving up there
B	tut
A	er that's how much easier
B	well
A	it would be
B	it would be easier
A	yeah
B	how frustrating
A	writing
B	yeah
A	I thought I'll keep the  I'll print the  and just say look I don't know what type of staff you're employing but there's
B	mm
A	if I have to drive to Sheffield
B	mm
A	to collect it I will be claiming back my mileage
B	absolutely
A	yeah
B	you were a student once
A	yeah
B	do you know what I mean? It's not like you you you exit out the door
A	it's not a big school Liz
B	really?
A	it's not a big school
B	mm
A	in the entire school there's two thousand students
B	oh right
A	so it's not
B	no it's tiny
A	yeah
B	I can't believe they need your certificates from school when you've got a degree
A	I know
B	that's mental
A	but they've said you know if we don't have the certificates this is the next best thing
B	yeah
A	come on school
A	no
B	I mean I'm really ridiculous with things like that
A	I think
B	but no we don't wanna go down that road
A	no
B	I mean you're better off you know you'd prefer to be on the phone to some retard than having to actually you know strike up communication with your mum
A	yeah
B	well worst case scenario then that's a trip to er the North
A	so worst case scenario gonna go
B	where's your school? Wrexham?
A	yeah
B	uh
A	also in
B	mm
A	and said look I don't know I'm I'm stuck now
B	oh
A	I can't decide now
B	yeah
A	it's problematic
B	mm
A	okay
B	mm
A	and he was like I said I'm gonna need quite a bit of time
B	all of those questions
A	um and he said okay
A	I said um I'll bring biscuits
B	oh nice
A	yeah
B	oh that sounds good
A	so
B	that'll just you know give you the opportunity to just ask every question you've ever heard of
A	yep
B	and get it clear in your mind
B	that's interesting though that you've had a bit of a one eighty
A	yeah
B	is it purely financial then? Or do you just think you'll have more fun? Or?
A	I I think I would have more fun
B	yeah
A	which is what I'd I'm thinking this is gonna be my whole life
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	so it's only
A	you want to make the most of that
A	yeah
B	you know it's not er you don't  you don't  I suppose you don't know but you don't know whether it's gonna be fifteen years
A	yeah
B	make it your career
A	yeah
B	might as well
A	six years
B	yeah
A	but I thought you know you don't go to work do your job and come home
B	mm
A	you don't
B	mm
A	your home life is with the people that you work with all the time
B	mm
A	and if you don't like the people you work with cos er per vessel per ship there's only eighteen officers out of the two hundred people on that ship
B	oh really?
A	yeah
B	wow
A	there's a real big difference
B	mm
A	and not fun at all and I'm stuck with two people that I would actually be friends with
B	mm
A	that's really not gonna be a nice lifestyle for months and months  and months  at a time
B	yeah
A	so that's that's my only thing
B	yeah
A	like people that are gonna go in there
B	mm
A	and
B	mm
A	at officer level are gonna be pretty clued up
B	mm
A	I can't imagine there being a lot of fun
B	no
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A will follow not such a great lifestyle for a while.	Entailment
A	I can't  I can't  see it
B	yeah
A	but I'd be willing to sacrifice that if I would enjoy my time there
A	mm
B	ultimately
A	that's what I wanna know
B	oh right
A	Cos I don't really know
B	shit
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A is about to spend some good time	Contradiction
A	yeah
B	mm
A	but he's like I can't really describe it to you cos you do so many different things all the time
B	right
A	if you were as a rating
B	mm
A	then it's really changed
B	mm
A	if I was gonna choose that's what I'd do
B	yeah
A	Cos he's a communications specialist
B	oh okay
A	so the progression path for both is different
B	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A has never talked to an expert in communications.	Contradiction
A	I don't think I don't know if er he obviously can't cross over
B	oh
A	but an officer he said basically he spends quite a lot of time pretty standard
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A is a multi-tasking person.	Entailment
B	mm
A	with more fun thrown in
B	mm
A	and they just
B	right
A	and they er they plan for stuff and it's not even real stuff
B	mm
A	so you might spend he said you might spend three or four weeks planning
[ANNOTATION]	Making plans can be a time-consuming process.	Entailment
B	mm
A	for a fake attack that never
B	mm
A	is never gonna actually happen
B	mm
A	yeah it does
B	but then I suppose that's that's the nature of the beast isn't it
A	yeah
B	to be prepared
A	that's it
B	you're responsible for people's safety
A	yeah
B	and and if that means that you know you're preparing for something that never actually happens in reality it could happen
A	yeah
B	and you wanna make sure that you're prepared for it
A	yeah
B	so it's what it's how you get satisfaction from your job I suppose
A	that's what I'm thinking
B	mm
A	I don't know
B	mm
A	until I actually know what they do from day to day
B	mm
A	if someone I don't think it's too much to expect
B	oh no
A	if somebody
B	yeah
A	it's varied
B	yeah
A	but I know it's gonna be contracts
B	mm
A	planning weddings
B	mm
A	it's varied but you
B	yeah
A	but every time I've asked it seems like they can't  they can't  give me the the box version
B	boundaries
A	they're just saying it's just it's so different
B	well maybe the reality of it
A	from what I can gather
B	is is that the
A	yeah
B	training
A	that's what
B	mm
A	officer
B	mm
A	but the officer oversees more people doing
B	yeah
A	it
B	well you're cos you're not  you're not  actually doing the job necessarily yourself are you
A	no
B	you're just
A	yeah
B	not at a micro level
A	it's not necessary is it
B	micromanaging otherwise
A	yeah
B	wouldn't you
A	so um
B	sounds like a good idea
A	and while I'm there I'm gonna fill out all the paperwork in the world they ever need and just give it to them there
B	yeah
A	instead of posting it
B	well er hopefully you'll at least have your letter from the school by then
A	mm
B	fingers crossed
A	fucking bastards
B	I mean it seems unlikely
A	I think that was the end of her life
B	er
B	oh no
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	and really just before I spoke to her
B	mm
A	we don't know a
B	mm
A	all the
B	ah okay
A	so you came out as a nice always a nice well-rounded person
B	excellent
A	and I said what do you what would you think of when you see a
B	mm
A	Cos I mentioned that
B	right
A	um
B	mm
A	not really much of a muchness
B	mm
A	not very capable
B	mm
A	have been quite like that or quite swotty
B	um
A	oh do you?
B	sort of but that could be where er I've come from
A	mm
B	so I think the girls that I went to school with are a bit like that
A	mm
B	netball girls
A	mm
B	big eyes
A	wow
B	and the other one is a teacher
A	mm
B	A bit scary
A	I see this
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	this is why
A	yeah
B	so do your parents call you
A	yeah
B	do they?
A	chose
A	yeah
B	oh
A	okay
B	so that's quite nice
A	yeah
B	and you get
A	yeah
B	whatever
A	so
A	huh
A	online obituary of
B	huh
A	I was like huh but because of the
A	and I was like
A	just for shits and giggles
B	just because  just because  you happened to have the same name as my boss
A	yeah
B	oh it's just
A	it's just
B	oh
A	like she's been christened with just
B	oh
A	yeah
B	she has a short one
A	short name
B	it's nice though
A	mm
B	I don't like many short names
A	oh
B	bit common
A	yeah
B	or
A	no
B	oh
A	no
A	no
B	no
A	no
B	Don't like
A	yeah
B	that's the problem
A	that's the issue I have with this
B	yeah
A	I like
B	which is nice
B	but that's because my dad
B	from a  from a
A	yes
B	book
A	yeah
B	and er so
A	I like
B	but they settled on
A	ah
B	which is nice
A	that's a nice name
B	er and then she was nearly
A	I didn't until I met
B	oh yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	she yeah she didn't  she didn't  remind me of a
B	no
A	I like the name Ivy and that's a short name
B	mm
A	yeah I prefer older older fashioned names older worldie names
A	well apparently
B	nephew
A	oh
B	an old-fashioned name
B	and um a chubby baby face
A	yep
B	but her their their my uncle's step-daughter so whatever she is to me
B	that's
A	A stranger
A	this stranger I know
B	this person that I sort of see at family gatherings
A	yep
B	and oh I was gonna say
B	that's not what they're called
A	that'd be so funny though
A	oh
A	A masochist probably
B	A masochist
A	yep
B	and life
A	yep
B	I I probably should get in the shower
A	clean clean your act up
B	clean all that
A	clean all the act up
B	yes
A	oh has she?
B	yep
A	oh
B	she is alive
B	um nothing
A	er yeah
B	nothing
A	nothing compares
B	are you did you make no plans cos you've gotta work tomorrow?
A	yeah
B	uh
A	do all the work
B	all the work?
A	all the work
B	oh huh man alive
B	A lambie
A	I do have a lambie
B	lambie
A	think I'm gonna have lambie now in my life
B	do it
A	huh
B	it was pretty exciting
A	yay
B	right
A	what film are you gonna put on?
B	um
A	hm
B	yeah
A	yeah
A	hm
B	yeah
B	so he got the chicken out and the chicken was
A	love pizza
B	and delicious
A	mm
B	not eat or something tomorrow
A	yeah
B	eating the lambie
A	yeah I should um I should eat something healthy
B	never
B	sausage club this morning
A	mm
B	it was just me and
A	yes
B	so I've just basically been pigging out on absolute shite
A	crap
B	like apart from the banana and I mean possibly the cranberry and orange but let's be honest it was really just a biscuit
A	do you know what I had for my tea yesterday?
B	what did you have for tea?
A	A whole bag a big bag of Doritos
B	nice
A	and a whole tub of fresh salsa
B	you should've eaten these you maniac
A	I ate them all
B	oh good
A	no
B	oh
A	bought some
A	the entire bag
B	that's quite good
A	I just ate half the bag and half the dip
B	mm
A	and then I was on the phone to
B	you're an absolute maniac
A	keen
B	chatting
A	mm
B	where is he then? So he's not on a boat?
A	mm mm
B	he's been on holiday
A	oh
B	for like three months or something
A	yeah
B	face
A	yeah
B	right
A	he's got a month's holiday
B	mm
A	Cos he's not going on tour
B	oh right
A	apparently
B	right
A	and he was on about wanting me to get a hotel room in Nottingham
B	right
A	very tempted  very tempted  Um so we toyed around with that idea
B	lovely
A	but er I'm a little bit concerned that he is seeing this girl
B	mm
A	which he doesn't seem to give a crap about
A	just do what I want
B	mm
A	um but he's like it's all very much in jest as in we wouldn't ask the other one if they fancied the other one
B	right
A	or how how much they liked them
B	cousin situ
A	yeah
A	I was like you did what? I said you do realize that that'll be on your computer now and we're not actually related
A	let's back-track a second
B	there's no blood
A	um and he was like well
B	nice
A	you can nominate somewhere
B	okay
A	and he's got this whole fantasy in his head that because obviously our names aren't the same or anything cos we're not really related then I could nominate to go on his ship
B	and you could shag him all the time
A	yeah
B	apart from the risk of the old court-martialling or whatever it is
[ANNOTATION]	Person B is going to do some hair cut	Contradiction
A	yes
B	they do to you
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Person A agrees with it	Neutral
B	mm
A	um but then he was saying stuff like that he'd googled it
A	like um
A	I thought
B	yeah
A	there's somebody inside
B	you're not cousins and you're certainly not Muslims
B	so
A	muslims
B	all in all everything's fine
A	yeah
B	no need to worry
[ANNOTATION]	Person B think there is nothing to worried about	Neutral
A	yeah
A	but um er
B	right
A	um and I'm probably reading too much into it but then he was asking about how many people I'd slept with and stuff
B	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Person B is thinking of reading that much long its good or bad	Entailment
A	his number's off the scale
B	uh
B	boys in the navy are disgusting

B	oo
A	and he said I just don't know how I'm gonna be with you like

A	yeah
B	good enough  good enough
A	yeah
B	close enough
A	yeah
B	um
A	close enough
B	um and B the comments such as spunk bucket
A	yes
B	all mean he's not a potential boyfriend
A	he's definitely not potential boyfriend material
B	no
A	no way Jose
B	but that is not to say one cannot have fun with one's whatever he is
B	yeah
A	I don't know what that would be
B	I dunno
A	yeah
B	but what so how did you leave things about the hotel?
A	um he said give me a date and I'll drive down to Nottingham
B	nice
A	mm which was decidedly the part-way between the two
B	mm
A	initially was Sheffield
A	and he was like sure
B	wow
A	yeah
B	is Sheffield not really close to Newcastle though? Okay
B	I don't know where it is
B	to me
A	what?
B	to me every is north
B	so for me
A	that everything's south
B	all the  all the  towns are here
B	all in the north
A	mm
B	of about you know sort of five miles
A	that's like me with anything below here
A	anything below Cambridge is all together in London
B	I've got absolutely no idea
B	whenever we talk to someone who's you know from somewhere north of London I'm like oh so whereabouts are you from
B	she's got no fucking idea where it is
B	there's no point
A	right
B	yeah
A	no
B	Sunderland
A	I feel the need  I feel the need
B	draw draw draw the country please
A	right
B	yeah
A	and that's I think that's like Scotland up there or something
B	yeah
A	right
B	er no
A	this is the
B	yeah
A	that is the bit of Norfolk isn't it
B	that's Norfolk Suffolk we're that's probably mm if that was there that's probably Leicester
A	yeah
B	we're probably about here
A	oh right
B	and Newcastle's here
A	yeah
B	okay
A	so that Scottish border's probably about there actually
B	okay
A	but
B	fine
A	um
B	okay
A	so the first place you'd hit from us you'd probably hit Peterborough
B	yeah
A	so for an hour
B	yeah
A	you carry on driving for another hour you hit Nottingham
B	oh right
A	you carry on driving oh I've I've got loads and loads of space left
A	Peterborough
B	yeah
A	that's probably a bit closer isn't it
B	yeah
A	and then this little bit where the the water comes in
B	yeah
A	is Hull
B	oh
A	so between Nottingham here and Hull here in the middle is Sheffield
B	oh okay
A	so that's where I live
B	right
A	so it goes us Peterborough Nottingham Sheffield Hull
B	yeah
A	Manchester's over that way a bit
B	oh
A	Leeds is just here
B	okay
A	and then after tut see after Hull I don't really know what comes after that
B	is it?
A	yeah
B	fucking hell
A	or
B	that's really far
A	yeah or maybe that's three and a half hours from Sheffield
A	so it would take me half the time if I drove from here to Sheffield that's half-way between here and Newcastle
B	shit man
A	I drove to Sheffield and then my dad did this route
B	oh right
A	so I did this route
B	which was two hours?
A	and dad did this route
B	no two three hours
A	yeah
B	two hours to Nottingham
A	yeah
B	with your driving
A	yeah
B	foot down
A	and then from here to here is about the same
B	three hours
A	two and a half three hours
B	fuck
B	that's much further than I thought it was gonna be
A	yeah
B	actually
A	there is Manchester at some point
B	I I think I didn't think that that was lower
A	ah
B	er well basically I just think everything's here
A	mm
B	all of the places
A	there's Durham here
B	are there
A	Durham between these two
B	and
A	oh is that round there? I dunno
B	Prr
A	Middlesbrough must be somewhere round this point as well
B	no it's
A	all I know is
B	Middlesbrough's near Sheffield isn't it?
A	is no norther that's near
A	Norther
B	oh right
A	so there's there's Sheffield and then God knows what after that
B	Hull
A	Leeds
B	places you don't wanna go
A	yeah
B	mm
A	then you get to kind of Middlesbrough and Durham area
B	yeah
A	Cos that's where the accents change
B	ah
A	that's how I know it
B	right
A	so then you hit more countryside and then the accents change from a Yorkshire accent to a what people get confused with a Newcastle accent
B	yeah
A	they get really twangy
B	oh like
A	and then Newcastle
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	and then the border
A	I mean there must be something between Newcastle and Scotland
B	sheep
A	but in my head
B	I don't think there's much
A	no
B	it's fricking freezing
A	yeah
B	on the coast
B	Liverpool is above Wales
A	yeah
B	because the ferry to Belfast would be back there
A	goes from there
B	yeah
A	ah
B	that's why you've got loads of Irish people in Liverpool
A	so maybe it goes Manchester then Liverpool
B	Manchester's kind of in the middle isn't it
A	yeah
B	I mean listen to me
B	it could be er I mean it could be anywhere
A	it definitely takes from Hull to drive to Manchester is on the same road
B	oh right
A	Cos I was like Manchester?
B	ah
A	yeah
B	I mean yours sounds pretty good
A	oh no everything from down here's London
B	well that's fine
B	Good
A	mm
B	as it were
A	no I don't
B	North of here
B	no
A	yes
B	thank you for the um geography lesson my love
A	that's that's alright
A	so it may be a a trip to the Sheffield
B	oo yeah
A	maybe I could er incorporate this whole thing with a trip to Nottingham for the birthday and a trip to
B	ah
B	yeah
A	could all just roll into one
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	just just don't go
A	I was thinking
B	yeah
A	um
B	the Easter week? Oh no the June week
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	Cos I thought if I tell
B	ah perfect
A	oh
B	that shouldn't affect your if we were
A	no
B	staying somewhere that you could get
A	no
B	have a little shop
A	have a look around
