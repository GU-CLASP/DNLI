B	what tell me how you get the recordings on an email
A	erm well from your phone you just kinda like erm
C	I'm so rubbish with all these technologies
B	how are you gonna
A	pardon?
B	how are you gonna get us to sign anything?
A	I'll send it to you in the post I've already sent stuff
B	I know I still don't know what happened to that
A	really?
B	yeah
A	just
unknown_female	yeah
C	what so if I get one at home I can send it to you?
A	yeah and you just have to sign the
C	okay I have conversations from time to time at home
A	they can't be with yourself or imaginary people
C	do you guys have Linkedin?
B	I do but it hasn't been updated for about four years
A	I do but I never use it
B	why? but
C	cos I forwarded my CV on to this person who was like really high up in HR and she's emailed me back and she was like de la la so your CV's blah erm you just need to you need to do a few things like join up to Linkedin
B	yeah I think it's really important
C	but what if I don't have anybody to like I don't know how it works but don't
C	you need people to endorse your skills?
B	yeah and you will find that loads of people that you know are on it and it'll automatically tell you cos it's like links up to Facebook or
A	yeah I need to update mine as well
B	cos as soon as I start looking for a job properly a job search er that'll be the first thing I'll update definitely
C	what? Linkedin?
B	yeah and especially if you're in HR I bet lots of HR people use it
C	oh that's so
B	I know but
A	erm
B	it's just a case really of getting whatever's on your CV on there and then getting a a
A	and actually like I have a really bad profile like I don't even have a picture don't have anything on it and erm I've been headhunted a couple of times through it like
C	oh wow
A	yeah people have said oh er erm have you thought about applying for this job?
B	yeah so that's a really good way of using it
A	and I I haven't I haven't put myself honestly I've not put myself out there at all so
C	but cos the girls were talking about it at work and they were like endorse mm the fact that I'm good with customers so people click on something
B	yeah so there are these skills so it says
C	but nobody's gonna like my skills now
B	yeah they will cos er I even like people who say your friends at work or your er
A	oh you took my tea away
B	no
A	my green tea
B	no
B	erm
C	you took my tea
B	erm
C	uhu
B	would they be on Linkedin?
C	I dunno
B	well you might be surprised
C	mm
A	the thing is it's quite cringey but then it's the way things are done now
B	yeah what I don't like is that you just type in
A	yeah I don't like it at all and also the endorsing skills my dad endorsed me how shit does that look? like
B	yeah
C	does it say does it show you who endorses who?
B	yeah you can click on it
B	the worst thing I think is that you can see when someone's seen your profile?
A	yeah
B	so like you'll go onto people who you're interested in and they know that you've
A	so I never look at anyone
B	mm
A	I never go on it to be honest
B	erm
C	it's just annoys me that you have to have Twitter Facebook
A	but I don't think you do
C	blah blah blah blah di blah
A	I just I also think in a
A	there is that whole part of the industry where everyone's like
B	yeah it's true
A	but also they're not
C	do you guys have Twitter?
A	no
B	I do although I haven't ever used it really and er oh it's embarrassing cos actually that's like the second thing down and there's a shitty picture of like oh anyway but actually a lot of journalists say but maybe it's different for HR cos journalism er you have to have a Twitter account but I don't use it
A	but then that's what Twitter's was was set up for journalism wasn't it? I guess
B	but don't worry about that but Linkedin if you're looking for a job first thing you should do I think cos it is like taking your CV
B	to just online and that can only be a good thing
C	yeah
B	and once you've set it up and put your CV on there and stuff you don't necessarily have to use it again it's just a good way of maybe of just having
C	yeah
B	it is scary though when you look up your name and then see like everything you've done in the past is on there and I hate it cos I thought god if I ever if I ever get famous
C	well with your articles coming out left right and centre
A	yeah
B	trying to commission you whatever and then you've got like your blog from when you were fucking fifteen on there or like
C	I think Facebook's difficult for us
B	yeah
C	er it depends what you've done but
B	we've been on it for
B	yeah
C	back when you're like drunk
B	eighteen
unknown_female	yep
A	and you don't wanna delete them
B	no
A	but also you don't want anyone to see them
unknown_female	no
B	no
A	oh I had to because when I was teaching
C	oh
A	like one like my students would come and be like we saw your Facebook I'd be like that's really spooky
C	yeah it's not ideal
B	did erm
B	oh bless her
A	yeah it must be so hard
C	ouch
A	are you alright?
C	I just cricked my neck oh oh I'm just breaking
A	I'm sure she'll settle in though
B	it's just so
C	well it's not long until ah
A	her brother gets back
C	mm yeah
B	but it's just so lonely
A	yeah
B	remember when it was just me and you in Spain? and we had each other at least
A	oh thank god
B	but it was just I had those moments of like pure loneliness and that wasn't even that bad a situation compared to her
A	no it was and we no that
B	I did as well I felt so lonely
A	and feeling so lonely and low and
B	I just
A	yeah it's really hard and it makes it's I like it's really hard to to make a good group of friends who you feel really comfortable with
B	exactly it takes a long time
A	and she's
B	but
A	miles away as well
B	yeah
A	oh
B	what is it after?
A	you know the book the number one detective agency?
B	oh that's it and erm it's really good cos there's all journalists on there and some people are like er
A	oh
B	erm
B	I'm on the hunt for a volunteer whose brows are in need of a bit of a boost to try a nano-needle eyebrow treatment so they're obviously gonna write up about it weird
C	have I got a
A	I've enjoyed this green tea
B	it's caffeinated isn't it?
A	mm they're all from the same plant like green tea red tea white tea
C	are they?
A	yeah
C	white tea is supposed to be really good for you
B	but then is camomile and all that stuff just other herbs and stuff? that
A	yeah
B	isn't the same? oh
C	why is green tea good for you?
B	I don't really know
A	good for your bones no I've no idea
C	good for your bone?
A	no I don't think it is that's just completely made up
A	I don't know but my grandad always says oh green tea's really good for you I think for your digestion
C	mm
A	maybe that's other tea I have no idea
C	peppermint tea's good for tummies
B	it is yeah you're right
A	I don't really like white tea
C	don't think I've had it
B	I don't mind it
A	kind of just like normal
C	mm
B	it is quieter in here the trains don't you think?
A	what? than in your room?
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	have you got double glazing?
B	no not right here
A	that'll be it in Finland they have triple glazing it's mental

A	that's what I I feel like when I went cos I went to visit my brother when he was living there
B	mm

C	yeah and expensive
C	it's rare that you go somewhere that's more expensive than England
B	mm yeah
A	yeah and not that like compared to Norway I if I was to go back I know Finland's not Scandinavia but I just I'd go to Sweden or Norway cos I think they're
C	I've never been to either of those but er

B	yeah but I mean like
A	well I dunno I've not had one so

B	mm
A	well I'm not saying like put the child in nursery like I'd hate that like
B	that's the thing though
A	but
B	the pressures
B	yeah
A	like this whole life is in your hands
B	yeah
A	I couldn't
B	but like the
A	but maybe like maybe you wouldn't like you know erm like
B	mm
A	and she had
B	yeah
A	and er I guess you just learn like you have to
B	I guess you surprise yourself
A	I think
B	you either are good or not yeah
A	and maybe like you wouldn't worry so much yourself cos you're more like concerned about like making sure they've got a good life and
B	yeah I
A	yeah
B	the other day we started talking about what I'm dreading is cos I'm so bored of wedding chat I'm just dreading the moment when
A	you
B	I'm certainly I'm certainly a big step behind a majority not all thank god but a majority of friends mainly like
A	but do you think you'll ever be like them?
A	I would absolutely love it if we got married
B	and I think
A	and we just turned into like absolute
B	that's all we talked about
A	after all after all the chat
B	all that chat
A	that we were like
B	it wouldn't surprise me cos we're knobs
A	yeah it's the kind of thing we do
B	but erm
A	but then like for example with
B	no but but what's worse is er that's fine but it's when everyone's er you know like
A	together?
B	when er people are together and they've all experienced something and then this is like like everyone talking about oh yeah well for my wedding for my wedding for my wedding
A	oh god but
B	honestly and I've had been in situations like that not that often often
A	no
B	with like the uni girls
A	that's the hard thing and you
B	but er sometimes it's just boring as fuck
A	yeah
B	cos you can't simply you just can't relate you know? but then I'm like am I just being like really cynical? but it's not that I just cannot relate to what they're saying
A	no I couldn't really couldn't
B	but anyway maybe it'll be different with babies I mean I think I'm getting more into babies
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a is following the explanation	Entailment
unknown_female	not like having them myself but like I'm beginning to understand why people have them but
A	no I mean I love children and I can't even imagine it

[ANNOTATION]	speaker b is not interested in visiting Croatia	Contradiction
B	mm
A	it's just I had such a good time this summer in Montpellier

B	mm
A	I I don't even particularly feel abroad there I love I love speaking Spanish like it it just
B	but it's not a holiday necessarily?
A	but I just er I love it equally so it's always it's always a difficult one cos it's always a draw
B	erm I get but like
A	Albania
B	yeah that
A	we could go and see
B	yeah

B	I well I went
A	yeah it's amazing isn't it?
B	people keep telling I don't think you should go there at this time

B	oh yeah
A	like not obviously Faliraki in Cyprus but other parts of Cyprus are incredible like
B	Ayia Napa you mean?
A	yeah where's Faliraki?
B	I think it's Rhodes

A	haven't been to any of them but anyway oh did I show you my erm my grandad wrote this article and it's like The Road to Ayia Napa and it's like the donkeys on the road
B	oh
A	to Ayia Napa and it's and my grandma's drawn a picture of like nothing so when they were there there was nothing in Ayia Napa
B	wow
A	and yeah he's written all these like the dusty track to Ayia Napa

B	you need to nip this in the bud
A	I know no I know and I I
B	I don't know how though but
A	I've erm been on loads of flights so I can't you know it's really horrible like when you feel you're getting a fear
B	I know
A	but you can't stop it so erm I also like I I was in a tower in Verona and I started to feel a bit like weird about heights and I've never felt weird about heights
B	mm
A	and I was like
B	no
A	I don't want this fear but you can feel
B	it's funny how you develop them as well well with flying
A	yeah what are you tricks?
B	I don't have any I'm shit at it
A	I'm not sure I've done like ten flights in the last month so but I dunno
B	you need a couple of smooth flights and it might make you feel better again

B	wow really?
A	yeah I cos I was freaking out and
B	wow that says something doesn't it?
B	well we shouldn't sit together on this next Ryanair flight should we?
A	but I always think that when you're with someone who's scared like I was quite good do you remember when we went when we last flew? and like and you were like
B	I was
A	and I was just chatting to you and I wasn't scared because like I knew you were more scared
B	but is it cos you just weren't scared?

B	wow
A	or longer but and it's just getting
B	I dunno if we just wind each other up are you a scared flyer? you're a

B	and who? who brought the Malaysian airplane?
C	before they found out that it was erm actually er a technical error that the staff just switched off
B	oh is that really what the thing is now?
C	yeah
B	in the flight

A	so everyone had their own pool?
C	not everybody er
A	how long were you there?
C	erm seven days
B	oh my
B	fucking christ oh my god look at that water
A	oh my
A	when you're ready?
C	guess what guess what
B	is that an infinity pool?
C	yeah
A	that's amazing
C	see like he gets into it he like er swims around gets into his little world
A	that is funny
C	oh
B	anyway what's er a dolphin? no
C	killer whale that was this I was
A	I've never seen a killer whale oh
A	oh
B	oh my god
C	there's a fish we saw turtles there
B	wow
C	two turtles in the middle of this er we went snorkelling all the way up there
A	oh my god it is stunning
C	erm
A	how did you choose the Maldives?
C	oh I've always wanted to go
A	really?
B	wow
C	that was like the view from the breakfast bar
B	fuck off
A	it is like heaven isn't it? I'd just love to be somewhere like that and just to completely switch off like
B	oh
A	forget what day it is and er I just wanna
B	mm
A	like leave everything and some
B	mm
A	say someone's gonna come for me when it's time to finish
B	yeah
A	and time to go home
B	yeah
A	just taps you on the shoulder and says off you trot
B	and then maybe you leave your phone at the desk and be like if there's an emergency I'll tell like tell your family what number to call
A	yeah
B	at the hotel don't look at your phone
A	like back in the day when we used to go on holiday as a family and like my mum would just give like my grandparents the name of like the
B	the hotel yeah
A	not even the hotel like the campsite or whatever
B	yeah
A	and like so that if there was a problem but now you'd always have your like
C	oh yeah er we turned I was like we're turning our phones off as soon as we got there it was like I don't want to be known
B	so did you have your phone on at all?
C	erm
B	that's such a good idea
A	couldn't you?
C	it's funny how much you do rely on it though like you feel uncomfortable after a while you're like well what happens if something's happened to my dad? and it's like well you know that used to like you say it used to happen where if anything was major you'd hear
B	you would hear somehow yeah like they would just find out but people would just find out the hotel you're at like like
A	yeah they would though
B	er people are more resourceful than you think
A	yeah and so what erm what so you were there for seven days?
C	yeah
A	were you just there on that island?
C	yeah yeah literally there's
B	even then I think you'd get a bit bored
C	yeah
A	yeah could you walk round the island? are there like things to do?
C	yeah we had bikes they gave us bikes
A	oh
unknown_female	erm
C	so you cycled round the island
C	wow
B	and then erm and then go via the Maldives or something spend like four days in the Maldives
A	where is the Maldives?
B	it's by Africa isn't it?
C	Indian Ocean
B	has that helped at all?
C	yeah
B	has it?
C	it's amazing thank you ever so much
B	has it actually though?
C	yeah
B	mm mm
C	I feel like when I do this I look very inquisitive like
C	mm
B	I think it's like there's Africa er like correct me if I'm wrong there's Africa and it's here
A	really?
B	is it?
A	like near Madagascar
C	it's like there they are
B	ah
A	oh well done
C	that's India Maldives
A	oh okay so not
C	and I was really to be honest I was scared about flying over like we had to fly over Iraq and everywhere and I was like that's when I freaked out because they did bring a plane down
B	it must be near the Seychelles then cos the Seychelles is around here I think
C	yeah
B	cos that's where my uncle's from
unknown_female	wow
A	so how many erm?
B	it's not actually near South Africa at all
A	no or
C	no
C	I reckon from South Africa to the Maldives is like nearly the same
B	yeah that's that's
A	so is er the Maldives is it just millions of islands? or is there?
C	millions
C	yeah they they did count them and
B	oh my god an hour's flight?
C	there's so many islands and honestly just looking out the
C	cos it's just you can't justify spending that much money
B	yeah I know
C	and the
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Maldives consist of 10 islands.	Contradiction
C	cos everybody from like the
B	see that's weird man and erm like
C	and you kind of yeah but they were all ever so friendly
B	I wonder what their lives are like I bet they live in quite poverty poor conditions
A	are there like yeah like poorer islands that aren't touristy or?
B	there must be places where people live
C	there must be yeah I think Mali is like I think it's the most er densely populated city
A	really?
C	in all the second or third something city cos it's like compacted I think that's got quite erm
B	you can't imagine great conditions there can you?
A	cos sometimes you see pictures I think it's more of the Seychelles or it might be the Maldives of like just
[ANNOTATION]	Τhe cost of living in the Maldives is low.	Neutral
B	yeah I guess it collects all up yeah gross
C	they're very probably very clever about hiding it cos you couldn't even see that from the air
B	yeah
C	my biggest ambition is to find or on my bucket list is to see a whale from the sky cos I reckon you would be able to
C	so I spent the whole hour's flight
A	why from the sky?
C	just because I'd love to see a whale and I'd be too scared to be on the sea to see a whale
A	I've seen a whale
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker C wants to see a whale while being on a boat.	Contradiction
B	how?
C	wow
A	well my
[ANNOTATION]	Someone has seen a whale.	Entailment
A	when I went when I went
C	go on
A	to Australia with my aunt
C	oh you
A	I was working on a boat that was tracking the whales up in the Indian Ocean
C	oh my
A	and we went out we saw like three hundred whales like they were like
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A saw only one whale.	Neutral
B	like big ones? or how big?
A	massive ones yeah
B	wow
A	they don't look that big in the sea like when you're on a boat so what they what they were doing was they were like counting them to see if the if they put an like if an oil refinery
C	yeah wow
A	erm
C	cos they say fishing harbours do now don't they?
B	what?
A	yeah it's
C	that like fishing harbours change cos er that was on that David Attenborough Hunt documentary which was amazing
B	oh I didn't see that I wanna see that
C	oh it was amazing you no that I'm sure is on BBC Iplayer but they had
B	yeah yeah
C	a whole mm erm blue whale? cos that's the largest one isn't it?
B	is it?
C	and they're just
A	I think ours were humpbacks that we were tracking
C	they're just incredible creatures
B	yeah
C	I'm
A	in awe of them
C	weirdly
B	wow
C	just to see one from at least er
B	yeah
C	if like if you're that
B	of this huge mammal
C	yeah
B	just in this ocean
A	but they they don't cos the sea is so big they don't look that big it's really weird
C	yeah
A	and like even when you're just in Australia and you stand er cos like my aunt's obviously like worked with them a lot she we'll just
B	wow
A	you we'll just be standing on the coast she'll be like there's a whale
unknown_female	wow
unknown_female	and I would just see it as the sea and then you can see them like doing all their like
C	tail
A	their tail flips and like
C	wow
A	puffing water out
C	wow
unknown_female	yeah the thing which was amazing is that obviously like you know this about whales but like they're just this the on the documentary you're just swimming along and suddenly it wanted to eat all the plankton or whatever it it eats
C	and then its thing just goes
B	are they they don't eat meat?
A	they don't like salt no it's a joke
B	yeah
C	I believed you then I was like wow
B	yeah how do they filter it out?
B	do they eat meat?
A	I dunno because
C	they can't er they basically if they open their mouth then it's pot luck what's in there isn't it?
B	yeah
C	no you er you could they could eat human
B	ah
C	and I don't think they'd mean to
B	ah
C	cos that would scare me like the amount that they open their whale er mouth
A	Jonah and the Whale ain't it?
C	yeah you'd just go right in there and then er I don't want to think
A	oh god you can't even imagine
C	mind you can swim in a a whale's vein or something it's that big
B	how big are they like in
A	they're just ginormous
C	they're it's crazy
B	like could it fill this room?
A	no bigger way bigger than this room
C	it's like
B	imagine that
C	almost like one of the
A	no that's big
A	they're just erm
B	compared to that shipping container what about a shipping container?
A	they're probably about the size of a shipping container
C	yeah the blue whale would be like
A	or bigger
C	the size of five of them
B	no
C	they're huge wait a minute
B	let me have a look let me have a look
A	and er it's
C	wow what?
C	so sharks eat dolphins?
A	they will attack them yeah
C	bastards no one like sharks
A	but the dolphins like all like
C	good
C	get into a little club
A	yeah
C	good
B	ah
A	the dolphin club
C	and whales I mean there's no point in trying to take that one out
A	no
C	mind you I don't see how a whale could defend itself
B	so twenty-five metres
A	so about
C	is that a large blue
B	the blue whale
A	so this room is probably like six metres
B	oh my fucking Christ
C	yeah
B	you're right a shipping container is probably only like
A	ten? we'll look it up maybe
C	so can you get a scale?
A	yeah and they have like
B	okay yeah
A	a human's toenail next to a
A	like a a human's mouth next to a whale's mouth
C	but yeah I've for some reason whales have always fascinated me so
A	but I just think and they're
B	you should go on like a whale watch somewhere
C	I would but then I get scared that
B	oh my god
C	like you
B	yeah
C	drowned
B	look at that so hang on how do I get all the other shit off the screen? so blue whale comparison to say an elephant
unknown_female	that's a fucking elephant in comparison and there's us that's us in comparison to that blue whale
A	er we're not like we wouldn't even like
B	oh my god I didn't realise they were that big
A	yeah
C	that's why it's they're so cool
A	but you honestly the the sea
C	they're like the last
A	the sea is so big you don't even realise they're big like they look small
C	you need to if you're yeah watch if you watch any episode of The Hunt watch the sea one because they show do the whale
B	oh my god
C	and they they also have the section about like these jellyfish that look like they're raving underwater
B	oh yeah
C	it's
B	is it cos they light up or something?
C	there's so there's so many different
B	yeah
C	because it just doesn't
A	who would put raving jellyfish in the sea?
C	yeah they are incredible and like they're all these crazy shapes that you would just think
A	er I remember we went onto this one beach and like you can't swim cos they're completely poisonous but all these jellyfish had washed up on the beach
B	oh
A	er and we were just walking in shoes and it's like they're it's like bubble-wrap and they've got like like a bubble and you just and it's like it's horrible it's like pop pop pop pop and it's like they're completely
C	oh
A	I can't remember what they're called
B	cor this is so sad so yeah like you say er they their diet is almost
C	oh
B	erm but
C	which we found out about last night
B	yeah
A	we need we need
B	blue whales were abundant in nearly all the oceans on earth until the beginning of the twentieth century
C	and then humans
B	for over a century they were hunted almost to extinction by whalers until protected by the international community in nineteen sixty-six a two thousand and two report estimated there were five thousand to two
A	no
B	twelve thousand
C	we
B	that's why it's so important people I just don't understand how people can't respect nature and like how
A	and we and it's it's getting worse that's what upsets me it's like we've we know this we know we're like we know we should protect them protect everything
B	I just don't understand
C	no
B	so before whaling there were about two hundred and thirty-nine thousand sorry this is really depressing let's just look at how nice they are
C	mm well no it's
unknown_female	but I mean
unknown_female	I guess at least they are protected now cos hopefully they can just mate a bit more and make a few more
B	hang on
C	there are two groups
unknown_female	mm
B	hang on
C	oh
C	that's good
B	oh so hang on sorry
C	this journalist obviously doesn't write as er
B	there remain only
C	properly as you do
C	and all
A	well I saw three hundred so there are at least three hundred whales in the world
C	that's
A	it's quite
C	but humpback whales so what do they look like?
B	they're just really big
A	and we saw a hammerhead shark as well that just swam past the boat and it freaked me out
C	that would freak me out when erm we went in the Maldives
A	are there Maldives in the
A	are there sharks in the Maldives?
C	yeah and but the the funny thing is when we got there like I loved the fact also their health and safety is not as anal as we are here
A	yeah
C	cos we had we didn't get any sort of briefings about what's in the sea they just said if you're going snorkelling don't go out when the current's doing you can't go to the side of the island because you'll get washed away in a current so they they were just like just go to the end of the reef and then you'll be fine
B	that's quite scary
C	yeah erm and but they didn't give you er kind of there's this in the sea there's this in the sea and so on in the sea I'm petrified of jellyfish and on land I'm petrified of cockroaches I hate the fuckers so
A	oh they're disgusting
C	yeah and erm
B	oh
C	yeah erm even though we were good we were respecting the tortoise but then
A	you should go to where
C	and they were like you just can't take any flash photography and then this dickhead took a flash
A	I dunno somewhere in
C	oh yeah cos you you showed us a video of
A	yeah
B	wow so amazing facts about blue whales their tongues alone can weigh as much as an elephant
B	their hearts as much as a car
A	ah
B	tiny shrimp-like animals called krill
unknown_female	mm
unknown_female	a single adult blue can consume three
C	I mean isn't that just also incredible that it's not it's this huge thing and it doesn't need to eat huge things it just survives on the most tiny thing
B	I know
C	in the ocean?
A	yeah and it doesn't it's not aggressive like it's it's big but it's not like I'm the
A	king of the ocean and I'm gonna kill everything
C	is that in your way?
A	no no not at all there's someone in the toilet
B	mm
C	do you wanna share the sixty-six million pound jackpot?
A	I can just share that out between sixty-six like everyone
B	they are thought to form close attachments then there's wow it's so crazy though we can't hear them blue whales
A	well don't don't worry it's fine
C	no cos you can't be comfortable
B	though we can't hear them blue whales are one of the loudest animals on the planet communicating
A	they're having a party down there
B	communicating with each other using a series of low frequency pulses groans and moans
B	it is thought that in er good conditions blue whales can hear over distances of up to one thousand six hundred kilometres
C	cor
A	no way that's mental
C	that's mental
B	it is thought that whales feel emotions
A	I don't know the door's still shut it's always open isn't it?
B	yeah someone's probably in it
A	I know
B	oh give it a
B	to attacks my sharks and killer whales but many and many are injured or die each year from impacts with large ships
C	oh that's er er
B	wow
C	the whole ship why can't they avoid them?
B	I guess it's quite hard if I dunno
A	but they'd come on their tracking system wouldn't they?
B	but maybe they wouldn't be able to I don't know
C	they probably don't give a shit
B	god I'd give a shit imagine that? it's like
C	mm
A	well it's worth how many?
B	yeah
A	it's just so big isn't it?
B	are you guys hungry?
C	mm
B	are you hungry?
C	strangely enough
A	erm
B	trying to think what to make for breakfast today
B	half a bottle of red wine I could
B	oh this is nice
C	I'm actually really not hungry which is strange
B	but in an hour you might be
C	oh okay
B	you're probably hungry now aren't you
A	I I need a wee so I can't think about food until I have a wee
B	I could
A	one thing at a time
B	it'd be nice to eat that nice bread wouldn't it with something?

A	do you have another toilet?
B	yeah first floor
A	where is it?
B	just er where the cloakroom is there's a door next to it

C	so you go down the stairs and it's on your left
A	really? on the like the one that you come in on? there's so many floors in this
C	I know
B	ground floor
C	it's like the Crystal Maze
B	well
A	okay
B	when you go through erm cos there's two you'll see do two doors and one is
A	hang on you go through
B	so you come down the stairs
A	yeah
B	on the ground floor on your left is a door that comes off the
A	first door on your left when you come
B	down and then first door on your left again left left it's not that complicated
A	it'll be really embarrassing if I like go into
B	don't worry about it
C	mm
B	we should go for a walk in erm
B	do you have any requirements for your stay?
C	not at all
B	anything you want to do?
C	erm
B	no? we'll have a chilled morning so we could have some nice breakfast
C	mm
B	and then we could go for a
C	yeah I think we met
B	yeah and then I
C	we could take some bread
B	yeah go round there and we could stop somewhere for coffee and then we could stroll back here watch a bit of telly read a bit of books
C	mm
B	relax
C	erm I need to find out cos they on the
B	mm
C	I need to find out
B	mm
C	but it says
C	engineering work
B	yeah
C	good service on the rest of the line
B	fine you're fine
C	but it says customers should use the
B	no you're fine erm like go
C	when I got on from when I got when I went to
A	yeah
C	oh
A	so I had to like find the light switch by the door
A	yeah
A	I can't believe I've never been in that bathroom before
C	I never have either
B	I never I never really go
A	quite a good bathroom
C	is it clean? as in like cos that must be just be his bathroom really
B	it's
A	it's really clean
C	that's good
B	do you have a cleaner?
C	I like a clean toilet clean toilet
A	where have you got to get to?
C	can I check it's you?
B	yeah
C	it's really good
B	view details
C	and
B	yeah cos you always get a bus from
C	yeah which I do also enjoy because you go past all the sights of
B	yeah it's nice
C	and it's number
B	oh
C	erm and
C	cos he's just scared of like not being able to control the situation in the sea
B	mm
C	like you're in their habitat
B	mm
C	and we saw lots of sea cucumbers which er constantly made me giggle cos they're
B	what?
C	sea cucumbers they're hilarious
B	what?
C	really little
A	oh really?
B	oh my god
C	and they're just like worms aren't they? but but they just
B	I've never seen that
A	I've never seen one
C	they're so funny oh I was giggling the whole way erm
A	it's really hard when you giggle in a snorkel
C	yeah mm erm
C	and then we got to the edge of the reef and we were just like oh trying to gear ourselves up to go over and then er we just saw this
B	what?
A	oh
C	but it was it was a reef shark so they're about that long
B	and they're not?
C	and they look like and they're
B	no
C	you just don't know like we didn't know if it was a vegetarian shark or
C	anything like that so we
C	but as soon as we like
A	or a vegan
C	tried we tried like
C	and we were like oh my god so we couldn't have been er like where that sofa is that's how close we were to these sharks
B	oh my god
A	oh fuck
C	yeah I know and we were like oh and then we started to swim erm back and then
A	mm
C	then we went down a bit and then went through this other gap and then suddenly the bed just gave way to this kind of well there was nothing like you couldn't see the sea it was amazing but really scary
B	what? with life you mean? or?
C	huh?
B	like with sea life?
C	well that yeah oh the fish are beautiful like again they're just all the colours under the sun they're gorgeous but it was just the way that
B	and then suddenly it dropped off?
C	and like it's er the
A	would you've done diving?
C	no no I couldn't do that I
A	what? if you burp?
B	no
C	I dunno but cos you're in control of that aren't you? and also there's all those things that if you swim up too fast you can
C	blow your brains out or something I dunno no that's too hectic for me but
A	you can get you can see so much just snorkelling that's crazy though just seeing the sea drop away
C	yeah er I've never seen
A	wow
C	I've never been very like been out that far ever in anywhere and it was just so beautiful because it was just so
B	wow
C	it was like Disney
C	and then there was one just
B	ah
C	like
A	oh and you saw him?
C	I
B	ah
C	and he was like that big like he was good decent sized one and then we saw another one
A	oh I'm so pleased you saw one
C	oh I I know otherwise I would've had to keep going back out I mean it was literally the most amazing thing I've ever seen a one-off and then we went back and er as soon as we got out of our back onto our thing you just saw this reef shark swim up to and they don't come that close because it's quite shallow and it was just funny the way that he just swam up to our
B	thing yeah
C	thing went under it and then away and it was almost like stay out of our habitat
B	yeah
C	or
B	oh keep out yeah
C	we let you live this time
C	but not next time
C	so after that
B	okay but I guess
C	so
B	that's when they feel
C	yeah
B	yeah yeah
C	threatened so
A	god sharks swimming around
B	so did you then avoid the sea? cos I guess was that the only time you went in the sea? or?
C	yeah the rest of the time we were
A	in the pool
C	in the pool and they had a pool and a beach bar which was really nice with the beds in the water so we
A	I just the love the sea like
B	yeah I know
A	that's why I like to be in like the Med cos I feel safe in the Med like you get
B	that's the thing I'm a like I'm a right pussy so if I was to go to the Indian Ocean I'd feel really scared to be in the sea when there was probably a stupid thing to be scared of I don't know
C	I wouldn't say it's I I think it's just you have to be sensible and the thing is there is nothing
A	in Singapore there are nets
C	had gone off course
A	mm
C	and was in er like we wouldn't've known we could've been out there we would've
A	mm like in
C	oh
A	but there was a shark in Valencia who got lost
B	oh really?
A	and erm
C	yeah that's the thing er there's always that one time when
A	but they can trap them in the Med cos they come in through the gap between Gibraltar
B	of course
A	and they can see them coming in
C	can they?
A	yeah
C	so what do they do? they don't kill them?
A	no I think they just say there's an
C	mm
A	and
C	er do they guide the shark erm
B	yeah
A	the
B	yeah once it's in the Med it'd be pretty hard for the shark to get out again
[ANNOTATION]	sharks get trapped in the Med easily	Entailment
A	yeah it doesn't like it there I don't think
B	no it's too warm isn't it?
A	claustrophobic
B	mm
A	it's so scary though
B	the sea does scare me I'm such a fucking
A	I think it's quite good cos when I was when I was in Australia with my aunt cos she's like she's obviously done so much with like the whales and like the sea and she's like lived on boats for months on end
C	that's so cool
A	she knows kind of what to do and so I
C	mm
A	when we went snorkelling I've only ever been snorkelling once in my life
C	cos that would be scary cos it's cos I don't know if I'd be able to snorkel there because they are
A	yeah
C	great whites about
A	but we were on like we were in this place called
B	oh scary
[ANNOTATION]	there are many sharks in Australia	Neutral
A	Coral Bay and it's got a big soft coral reef so the sharks don't really go into the coral reef erm so we kayaked out attached our boats and then erm and then we were like snorkelling but yeah they're like don't wee in the sea because the shark can smell it from like miles and miles and miles away and they know there's something there
C	it's crazy
[ANNOTATION]	there are many sharks in Coral Bay	Neutral
A	I was really scared cos I
C	but what an interesting job
A	I cut myself on erm coral and I was like bleeding and I was like oh no the sharks are gonna come
unknown_female	it's very unlikely they they they kind of do follow very similar patterns like and you shouldn't go in at dusk I think that's when they get a lot at the surface
C	it's like a feeding time isn't it?
A	yeah so I think there are like certain precautions you can take
C	have you seen that video when er that guy's doing like surfing and he gets attacked but he like punches it

unknown_female	mm
unknown_female	and orcas those black and white killer whale things
B	yeah I was just
C	they eat they literally eat the on you watch this Hunt it's erm beautiful and I love David Attenborough but they like come up to the seashore to try and get seals and they kind of launch into this pre-planned attack of like getting the pups as they're like
B	they're very intelligent aren't they?
C	but then they can beach themselves and then it's like well that's your own fault but then
A	they
C	it's not really
A	recently they've stopped like cos they used to keep killer whales in captivity didn't they? and I watched a documentary did you see that?
C	no but is that where Seaworld in America?
B	oh no
A	I was crying
B	I have not

B	after the documentary I'm so glad jesus
A	oh
C	I don't see it's it's sad isn't it that
A	mm
C	but fortunately my parents never and I'm glad they didn't because you kind of go from what your parents like if they're gonna take you to Sea Life centre or something you're gonna go
B	yeah
C	but I'm so glad that they never took us to anything like circuses or
A	no
C	any er thing like in America where they do those shows
B	it's awful yeah
A	I felt really bad in the Oceanogràfic in Valencia I didn't like it when I saw er seeing those dolphins and
B	yeah when you see like I remember like seeing quite like a not a huge whale but a whale
A	yeah in a smallest space it was so sad but then it's nice to see them I dunno it's
B	but it's it's nice to for us to see them but
B	yeah it's got nothing to do with us why they exist
A	imagine if they
C	mm
A	collected us and put us in cages
B	I know
A	we'd be mental
B	the problem is with human beings and I
C	we'd turn on each other
[ANNOTATION]	someone is planning an experiment to cage humans	Neutral
B	I do I must say the Bible does er not the Bible religion also like makes you think that as well that men own the earth but really the earth is not it doesn't own us but the er the earth is
A	and we're like quite high up the chain
B	it's giving us the conditions to be able to live on earth but we don't own it we don't own Mother Earth do we? it's not and er we don't own it more than a whale does or a seal or whatever
C	mm no
B	like we're all equal animals on this earth
A	no of course not no
C	we wouldn't we're actually not that great at survival now because we've got lazy so actually if they took all the weapons away we'd be screwed
B	yeah I know but we think we have this like
C	and they can bomb
B	mortal right
C	bomb each other from thousands of miles away what's the kind of that's cowardly
A	yeah
B	but we think we have this mortal right that we own this earth and we do not own it and that's what's sad because we then we think we think we have the right over all animals and think we can kill them and there's no comeuppance and we think we can do whatever we like it's disgusting
C	I think the world is
B	mm
C	like things like Facebook I think help
[ANNOTATION]	speaker c owns a weapon	Neutral

A	yeah
B	it'll live on cos it's a powerful thing but it's about not about saving the planet it's about helping people live in harmony with the earth for for as long as possible without basically making it an
[ANNOTATION]	in Norway they hunt whales	Entailment
A	yeah
B	and I don't think people realise that you have to work with the environment rather than think you can rape it for all its worth dunno
