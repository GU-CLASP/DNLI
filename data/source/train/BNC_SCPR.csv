A	well dad you know that you you didn't let her have the money you you evil mean man
A	but no what a lie
C	mm
A	mm
C	and in fact she should have stopped me from
A	yeah if she you asked her do you want some money? and she said no
C	no
A	so you put it in a savings bond
C	well it were only a one year bond so it's not as though it's going to be

C	well well she's got some in she's got some in her long term stuff which is in
A	yeah it's not like growing quite a lot
A	yeah
C	but I've left it here there there's no point in
A	mm
C	she likes that and the interest so there's no point in saying it
A	yeah
C	so and then she's got
A	mm
C	and about
A	mm
C	she's got about a hundred and twenty-five thousand in cash well near

C	yeah her phone bill was eighty-three pound for the quarter
C	I negotiate
A	that's gonna eat in eat in
C	I had to negotiate the lowest deal I could with BT you know but she still thought it was a con
C	er so she's got five thousand pound or six thousand pounds in cash
A	mm
C	she's got
A	and then there's six in her current
C	forty-three
A	you forgot
C	yeah well that's the big one and I don't know how much that is but the whole lot comes to about a hundred and twenty-five of which half of this is
A	why doesn't she have it all in one place? or is it that just not very er
C	well
A	yeah
C	they only get seventy-five thousand out so I make sure
A	oh yeah
C	that there isn't more than seventy-five
A	mm
C	is what I buy
A	yeah
C	five thousand or ten thousand or twenty thousand into simple as that
C	yeah see I have no idea what where that's invested it's probably
A	that's in it's just a Nationwide account then

A	yeah and I was just like
C	I dunno where that money is and I dunno what it's invested in
A	mum's got it
C	yeah well so I haven't got I haven't got a clue it's just probably just drifting along doing nothing
A	but erm did you the spend seventy pounds
C	on what?

A	oh
C	it's still there if you want
A	no no it's mum's well it's for mum but
