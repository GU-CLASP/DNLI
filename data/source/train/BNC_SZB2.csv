D	well
A	day I've got something left over
D	well I
A	that I really need to eat up and I feel too bad
D	I
A	too bad not to eat it
D	I'm not doing strictly five hundred calories or six hundred but
A	mm
D	but it erm I'm doing
C	how many did you do at the beginning? you know the
D	I kept er fairly well
C	er five hundred
D	six hundred actually because they the thing they
C	oh
D	they gave
C	I just I just wondered
D	five hundred for women and six hundred for men
C	oh right
D	as well so the original
C	mm
A	yeah
D	thing was but erm
A	I wonder if it really does
D	and I said it worked very well
A	well it did
C	well yeah I remember
D	mm
C	mm
D	I shed a lot of weight but now
A	which is still you know a lot less than normal isn't it?
D	yeah er
C	that's it and it's it's been it's thinking about it it's
A	mm
D	but
C	you know
D	the problem is I have when I've done it in the past quite successfully I have then just gone away and put on weight and that
A	right
D	is what I'm
A	trying not to kind of
D	and I weigh myself regularly at the gym and erm
C	and you weigh
D	uhu
A	yeah
C	then erm I think that again you can just you can you can you can you can see what's happening
A	yeah
D	uhu
C	mm erm
A	I know I got a weighing machine a while ago just cos it's it's quite good just to keep it on
C	mm
A	like for me like after you've been pregnant and that kind of thing it can it can just really go you know your body doesn't really remember what it was or anything
A	so it can if you can back a
D	yeah
A	and just even
A	just knowing is quite useful
C	mm mm erm do you still go the gym then
D	mm yeah the a bit less
A	yeah
D	mm and
A	what do you do there? do you do the?
D	I'm getting cramp in my legs
A	mm
D	at night and that sort of thing and so I don't go so often
A	no yeah
D	and I don't work as hard as I did
A	yeah
D	erm what do I do?
A	yeah
D	and then I do the round of the weight machines
A	yeah
D	one or two I don't do which
A	oh right
D	erm more affected by the the arthritis
A	yeah
D	erm
D	no I had two joints replaced and erm

A	okay
C	so they're not
A	oh
C	is he alright?
A	yeah
C	is on the twenty-sixth and
A	yeah
C	now what a couple of times
A	oh yeah
C	erm cos they were both away er
A	yeah
C	and they now right
A	mm
C	they get erm delivered to their house
A	yeah
C	six meals
A	six meals?
D	no
C	six meals
D	I don't think it's mainly six but
C	erm
D	I
C	er er no
A	as in all
C	three
A	erm
C	three meals for four people they started this
A	in on plates?
C	no no no no it's all the ingredients for six
D	well no
C	for for these three meals that can feed four people right?
A	really?
C	the ingredients
A	what from Tesco's?
C	no not from from Tesco's from somewhere else
A	oh
C	from this firm erm that they give you the recipe and if you need a teaspoonful of salt there's a wee packet with a teaspoonful
D	no
C	of salt
D	they they the they use their salt
A	really?
D	I think mm
C	oh well
D	mm
C	you know or
D	but
A	yeah
C	half a teaspoonful of paprika
D	spices and
A	yeah
C	erm anything that is
A	oh
C	it is all there
A	wow
C	the whole thing is there
A	yeah
C	right? and you get the recipe so you have to cook it
A	yeah
C	and they got it when
A	oh
C	and you know and are trying to give them new
A	yeah
C	her new things all the time erm and she's at work
A	yeah
C	and it's fascinating
A	oh wow I didn't know that kind of thing existed
C	yes yes they they they invited us for a meal of one of them
C	and one one of these days we are going to get a box because
D	and you get
A	what are they called then? do you know?
D	they get a yes they get a
D	free meal every now well every
C	mm
A	yeah
D	give it away to somebody so but it but it's publicity
A	oh okay
D	you know
A	yeah yeah yeah
D	erm
A	yeah
D	and erm
C	to a friend
D	to
A	to a friend
D	to a friend yes
A	oh what a great idea
D	and er
C	I've never and and to be honest for people who erm
A	yeah
C	love their grub and like cooking
A	yeah
C	but erm cos you've got as I say you've got to cook it
A	mm
C	and you've got to follow the recipe
A	yeah
C	erm
A	yeah
C	I mean I would eat the same dinner till it was finished
A	yeah
C	before it had turned and like changes who are erm well enough off to sort of just
A	yeah
C	can order this cos obviously it's a bit more expensive than
A	yeah
C	erm erm er what a brilliant idea
A	yeah
C	er
D	well
A	yeah
D	er a couple of their friends it was er are vegetarians and found it out and then
C	that's right and they live in London actually
D	mm
C	er
A	yeah
C	but
A	well I suppose especially if people you know if you're quite busy both are working
C	uhu
A	then it
C	mm mm
A	it cuts out all that sort of what shall we
C	mm
A	oh what do we do is there a
D	the they are perfect candidates for it
A	yeah
C	mm
D	no children
A	yeah
D	erm
A	yeah
D	both working
A	yes
C	mm
A	yes
D	erm
A	and they don't necessarily er want packet meals but they just don't want
C	in
A	at that time
C	in the
A	mm
C	in sort of like a smallish kitchen
A	yeah
C	to have twenty million things around and er
A	well with sometimes if you want to cook something
C	mm
A	really nice as well to buy all the
C	that's what I mean you've got to you've got to
A	yeah
C	you've to have spaces to keep them all
A	yeah
C	erm
C	erm
A	that's a very good idea
C	I
C	and some company
A	yeah
C	erm
A	mm
C	they they're
A	I know supermarkets are doing that a bit more anyway aren't in
C	mm
A	erm
C	erm
A	maybe it'll come down
C	but but
unknown_female	oh yeah
A	where they're they're selling ingredients but all packaged up
C	mm
A	so it would be like these are the vegetables to go with this whatever so you can kind of
C	uhu
A	cook it but you don't have to
D	mm yes yeah
A	so it's a popular idea generally
D	Tesco don't do that
C	mm
A	no M and S
D	so you can
A	and erm
D	Waitrose probably?
D	uhu
C	but I just thought
A	it's cook it or something
C	what a very good idea
A	they're called and they have just
C	erm I would hate it myself you know you've got to eat all of these blooming things
A	yeah
C	but
C	but what a brilliant idea for people as I say who
A	yeah
C	who don't necessarily you know and I mean if you've got children it would be a bit expensive just for the two of you
A	yeah
C	and then you'd have to cook separately
A	yeah
C	you know
C	erm
A	but especially the two of them that nice stage where you haven't got kids and you're
C	mm mm
A	you're grown up enough to experiment
A	cheese on toast you're after the university years
D	but also you've got
C	that's right
D	you've got two incomes so
C	mm yeah
D	erm
A	yeah you've got two incomes
C	and do you know but they they go out in the on they've got so three three
A	yeah
C	they actually go out one night
A	oh that's
D	no they
A	nice
D	go out two nights I think
A	do they?
C	oh no well well
D	the
C	they ought to
D	no there's three recipes this is what they told me they eat they eat it as supper
A	uhu
C	yes
D	and then he he
C	oh I see
A	oh
C	oh right so they go out a lot then
D	yeah they go out
A	and they go out to pubs twice a week
C	mm but er erm
A	and they get er pub meals do you think? that's quite nice I quite like the sound of that
C	and of course they live
C	and they live
C	in
A	oh yeah
C	er which is very near
A	very central
C	the
A	yeah
C	erm lots of eateries around them
A	yeah
C	erm
A	yeah
C	and er they've er renewed the lease for a year
A	oh have they?
C	what darling?
A	they like that house though don't they?
D	I think he he's going to sit up and and think
D	of something else he's got to do
A	he does that all the time as well he'll come up and kind of go night-night and you think oh he might actually stay there a bit you know goodnight
A	it's his game and like straight after
A	up and down up down up down
C	oh but that was lovely
A	I don't I don't think he's gonna put on weight
D	mm
D	well that started from the leftover rice
C	no that started from the leftover
A	ah
A	sometimes the best things do don't they?
C	erm er but it was erm but we and as I say we do see them we do
A	yeah
C	er erm
A	but not just quite
C	erm
A	as long as before
C	but erm
A	mm
C	it's not quite as er and again it means erm
A	really?
C	yes
D	yeah they
C	their overflow guests

C	when was this?
A	well the BBC
C	I bet by
A	the BBC had a review on it
C	of course
A	it was really funny
C	of course and it wasn't it Jeremy Paxman who
C	grew a beard for it?
A	he grew a beard and then he shaved his
C	oh right yeah
A	less and less people would have beards
C	mm
A	but I'm not sure it's true everyone's still growing growing
D	well mm
A	beards we haven't reached peak beard yet
D	the yeah well yes but they
A	yeah
C	you use it
D	which cuts it right down to it's just
C	yeah
D	stubble
A	oh yeah
D	which is basically all I have at the moment
A	which is a kind of designer beard
D	because you see I well because I go to the erm I can't be bothered to shave my beard off I I really can't but er I go the erm
A	yeah
D	er to the er er to to the dermatologist er every we go every three three months and of course I she's
A	yeah

D	er and then erm and then I had erm
C	how long did it take you to grow your beard can you remember?

D	no
A	yeah
D	it doesn't seem
C	oh your mother would be so proud of you
D	but er
C	cos she used to hate it cos
A	yeah
C	deliberately
A	yeah
C	wait well maybe not deliberately but er there was a part of it deliberate because his mother used to
A	yeah
C	erm and
D	well you remember that sort of a hairdo
A	yes
C	yes and it got quite kind of curly and wild
A	oh
D	well it when it starts
A	yeah
D	sticking out growing out that way
A	yeah
D	that I used to think that perhaps I ought to have it cut
A	yeah that was quite curly at the ends wasn't it?
C	yeah
D	cos erm the erm
C	and your beard grew quite erm big
D	but not
A	yeah
C	kind of fulsome but kind of
C	his his mum used to
C	till he said he'd do it
A	yeah
D	erm
A	yeah not as thin as
D	just it's just
A	most blokes go thin though don't they?
D	it's just thinning out I think
A	yeah
D	isn't it? whereas erm
A	mm
C	well even I'm
D	the thing that
C	going going
A	but isn't it's that
D	but
C	on top
A	I've got friends who are a bit like you know maybe you're kind of like
D	yeah
A	I think it's the
D	well I I I had a biopsy here and er just under the beard there
A	yeah
D	and that was
C	about three weeks yes
D	about three weeks
C	mm
D	ago
A	yeah
D	and erm I I bought the trimmer so that I er cos it's it buying a trimmer is cheaper than keeping on going to to the barber's
A	oh yeah
D	to to get your
A	yeah
D	your beard er
C	seven quid
D	trimmed down
A	yeah
C	to get your beard trimmed
D	no it's it's
A	yeah
D	it's less than that but it's
C	oh less than that and anyway the barber's scarpered
D	but about
A	oh yeah
D	but
C	when it matters eh?
D	about
A	yeah
D	but the erm but erm but even so it's only twenty quid to buy the machine so I mean
A	yeah
D	you only have to get it done four times and you've and you make your money
D	and that's quite a good machine erm
A	yeah
D	but the but erm so so this what I've got here is is three weeks' worth which is I think is pretty pathetic
C	no I think it's actually quite good for somebody of your age I mean I don't really know I don't know
D	no no I don't know
C	erm
D	but I er I just feel but yes because I'm going regularly to have my skin cancer checked
A	yeah
D	erm I've got to take it I mean I take
A	yeah
D	don't have to
A	yeah
D	right down but
A	and I think it's better as well cos you can if you right you really shave it and there's just a little bit like a people poking round here you just get slight
C	I don't I don't know but it I've never known
A	no
C	you actually did get it shaved once
A	but the
C	right off
D	compared with

C	they all have three children
A	oh really?
C	except for
D	they're all
C	the the the the few who have got twins er
A	oh
A	oh right
D	it's
D	it's a terrible
A	god
D	pressure on primary school places in
C	oh yes they
A	oh
C	had to build a whole
A	really?
C	new bit in the playground yes
A	really? wow
C	mm it's almost double the size now
A	oh goodness
C	mm and erm
A	wow
D	and it's erm
C	erm yes and as this er young gentleman erm who is born and bred there
C	er
C	blamed it on all the incomers and I like to think oh my goodness that my
A	yeah
C	my children are incomers here
A	I think there's pressure
C	but the
A	been everywhere hasn't there?
C	I said I as I explained to him
A	and they'll have to build a new school
C	erm
A	build a new school in
C	well
A	cos of the pressure
C	mm yes
A	for places
D	well what?
C	but but
C	do you do you know what happened?
A	they're building
D	you see but the problem they have
C	mm
D	is erm they
A	the
D	er cos I I was in on the discussions of this when I was a councillor
A	oh so you're in the know?
D	erm and er there's er which was that they they said oh erm
A	yeah
D	they said oh well we won't have any children there because this
D	you know and they said we we won't need
A	oh
D	a new school or anything like that
A	but then what happens
D	but
A	what happens to the newly marrieds?
D	apparently er the place is is crawling with children
A	with kids oh
D	erm er because erm
A	yeah
C	it won't be the the right
D	no these these flats which are near
C	no no
D	the station
D	which are by er well they're not in the station obviously they
C	the the station ones are all for students
D	no I know but the
A	yeah
D	if you go to the left
A	yeah
D	you've got
C	where
D	student families with children
A	yeah
D	and that sort of thing
A	yeah
C	but where
D	yeah
A	yeah
C	oh
D	no no
C	oh right
D	crawling with children
D	er and just as well
A	yeah
D	like he
D	but the erm er but the point is
A	yeah
D	if they can't increase the size of
A	yeah
D	er it's there's
A	yeah
D	and there is nowhere in erm the centre of
A	yeah oh yeah in the centre yeah
D	is is er it's and they do not
A	there's one in
D	well the the I think they have increased the size of erm er what was it?
C	I don't really know that area very
C	mm
D	erm
D	er but but I don't think it's a new school there but I think they've
A	cos
D	doubled the size of one
A	oh right
D	so they
A	I think there's going to be a I only just saw it the other day it was just erm er no they had some they had the plans and I don't know how off you know how long away it's going to be
D	oh right
A	before it can open
D	yeah
A	but it but it was around a sort of
D	I'm saying it's not built yet
A	it's not built yet
D	no no no
A	so
C	mm
A	but you're saying
D	so we're not
A	is that there's actually
D	well er
A	nowhere to build somewhere like for example around by the station where there's so many new places
D	but that's right and
A	so what what do you do? I suppose
D	they think they they think they're
A	what do you do?
D	going to have to bus them
D	out
A	wow
D	erm
C	well because the there's another one quite near there and it was called was it
A	is that

A	yeah
D	state pension
A	yeah
D	which is about eight times the and I know that that it was eight times he said it was eight times the pension
C	erm that's er
D	the the pension of Bulgarian old people
A	oh really? wow
D	and erm
A	so you'd be just
D	but also they get things like
A	quality of life
D	because the we've got a a mutual agreement with erm
A	yeah
D	er er
A	ah
D	erm
A	yeah
D	and they say that
A	the medical practitioners

D	and er
A	yeah
D	she they said that that someone was saying they say they're erm amazingly philosophical about it
A	yeah
A	yeah
D	obviously it's tough for them and erm
[ANNOTATION]	It is difficult for Bulgarian people to get health care	Entailment
C	mm
A	yeah maybe if
C	mm
A	I know there's a well I suppose it's all kind of a big experiment to sort of see how things pan out maybe when the young ones come here all the older ones will go somewhere else
D	yeah
C	perhaps there's a sort of demographic shift you know
D	but
C	where old people
A	yeah
D	apparently er
