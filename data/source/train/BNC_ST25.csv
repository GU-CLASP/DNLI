C	what's he done?
A	it was hacking that was terrorism they were planning to bomb a Anzac Day parade and I think he was sixteen
D	oh was that the one where they were going to try to try and encrypt all over it again?
A	what's crypting?
D	cryptography
C	no that
D	and there was a whole fuss about how his texts were encrypted
C	no it was in it was at an Islamic State
A	thing
C	thing
A	erm actually but on that subject I when I was running this morning I heard this really er it well thought provoking I thought conversation on the radio about whether or not erm basically phones should be lockable so that even manufacturers can't unlock them
D	oh yeah cos Apple say they actually can't
A	they actually can't unlock them
D	get into people's Iphones on demand
A	and this man who was like a police officer was saying er we have to be able to we you know just like we can now we don't normally break into people's houses but if we need to go in there for good reason we get a warrant and we can go in so therefore it has to be the same on phones
B	that's
A	well that's one way of looking at it but
B	mm
A	but he also like
A	what there are
A	there are things in the world that are secret like what goes on in my head or a conversation that
C	mm
A	there is no way the police officer could find out about that and he can
D	mm
B	yes but
C	mm
B	only do it when needed it's just extra information
C	there's another problem
B	oh you're so trusting
C	in that if say
B	well yeah exactly but
C	if Apple had built in a way to get into their phones someone else who's a criminal will discover it and will exploit it
A	well that's one thing that they they call it a back door
D	yeah
A	and so say you have a back door and put padlock like a er on it and there's only one key and you give the key to the government that basically none of us think the government are gonna be capable of looking after the key and then
D	yeah
A	remembering where it is
B	that's true
A	when they need it so I think that in itself if the if the process was to do something like that er you'd just think well
B	they should make
D	yeah
B	one when they need it and then delete it
C	that still means the company that makes it has to have a key
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker D holds an I-phone.	Neutral
A	mm
B	they can delete the key though
[ANNOTATION]	Only the owner holds the key.	Contradiction
A	yeah but once you've got something
D	I think the
A	they'll you'll find it again
D	someone has to be able to produce the key and if someone can then anyone else can
A	and so the well the choices we've got are really really really completely secure stuff like there's well kind of the where we're ending up and that
D	mm
A	and also enables people to trade and do onliney stuff whereas if I didn't trust my phone to be able to do the banking with or whatever then
D	mm
A	er leaving aside trusting the police so it's kind of quite thought provoking
D	yeah
B	mm
A	I don't yeah I don't know what the answer is I mean I
D	yeah
A	but it's
D	not if you're a criminal
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A has never done a payment via phone.	Neutral
A	actually quite a big philosophical
D	yeah
B	yeah
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	The speakers love philosophical discussions.	Neutral
C	mm yeah
A	I might have another slice
B	same size? or
A	mm
B	no
A	no?
B	there was
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A possesses an extra slice for certain.	Contradiction
A	no
B	quite a bit of fruit though so
D	quite a bit of food
A	do you think it's because they do the same business about the recipes are always the same size if they're for a hundred or
D	yeah
A	seventy or fifty
D	yeah it's true that mm
B	yeah if we we had
D	how many were there?
C	yeah could be
B	forty
D	yeah
C	really?
B	yeah
D	but you had
C	do you want some of mine?
D	sorry?
C	oh did you did you have Pathfinders?
B	yeah
D	we had three Pathfinders
C	oh you had Pathfinders didn't you?
D	yeah we
B	we had
C	did you go with the Trackers?
D	no
B	no eleven Elves
D	no we had
B	er eight
C	oh
D	what about wardens?
B	about er eleven
D	yeah and there was so much food that we ended up getting four lemon cakes
C	cos
D	we had the Pathfinders
B	the Pathfinders
B	that's one
D	yeah
B	of the
D	it's like we asked for a lemon cake cos we'd seen them in the tent and then they just kept giving us lemon cakes
A	that's how they saw you
D	we had quite a lot of biscuits in our in that camp cos the staff were all so pissed and they just went into the
B	we had ten last time like I had ten but actually
A	eating outside just is good stuff tastes nicer
D	yeah
B	we can see at midnight this time the staff weren't particularly drunk we know this because they had
C	they weren't or they were?
B	they weren't we know this because they came and asked where our
C	mm
B	cos our
C	no
B	that's the really it's the official game of Vietnam
A	I think you said Pakistan
B	Pakistan I'm not sure
D	oh
B	like er
D	is that the one where you throw a ball at a wall with no
B	no
D	no
B	so
D	isn't that the thing from the
C	no
B	so you have a
C	no they
D	you have a thing cos there was a Anzac game or something
B	you have a two metres
C	no
D	yeah
C	there was the there's the
B	the the
C	the national
A	the the
D	yeah
B	yeah the two by two metre box with the line down the middle
D	uhu
B	and mum asked at that point which way
C	right
A	which was a sensible question because if
C	no it's not if it's two by two
A	it had been this way yeah but if the line if
B	yeah
A	the line is here I I understood but it could have been here
D	or it could have been there
A	yeah
C	but it would have been the same
D	no it
A	well no because then it would have
D	not if
A	then it would have
D	but you're already assuming
B	no I haven't
D	that there'd be teams on
B	yeah you
A	well I had
C	yeah
A	seen them as I walked up towards them
C	the mum mum
A	I had seen them playing
C	mum if it if it went that way then the teams would just be here and here
D	no they wouldn't necessarily
A	well no if we've decided
B	shh shush shush
A	this is team
D	we don't know what the line is for
C	I don't
D	we don't know if it's two halves
B	but if you let me finish the sentence you find out I can't think what I was saying now
C	mm
B	erm so that you've got a team in each half
C	mm
B	there you go and
B	turn
C	it really is
B	attacking and defending the aim of the game is to get all the players on your half
C	mm
B	and the attacking team they choose one person
A	so that's me?
B	yeah and
C	oh sorry
B	you will cross the line and when over the line you can't breath
C	and to prove you're not breathing you say
B	it's
C	Kabaddi Kabaddi Kabaddi
D	and you
C	and so on
B	you've got to touch as many people in the enemy team as you can and then put a
C	oh
D	oh yeah
A	so I have to touch
C	but
A	so I have to touch so I have to cross the line saying Kabaddi Kabaddi Kabaddi touch you two and then get back over this side?
D	yes
B	but we are allowed to take you down anyway
D	yeah
A	cos you're under attack?
B	erm
B	if you're
C	or
B	on the floor or thrown over the edge
C	I've done it on rugby but without the not breathing because then if you get tackled in the stomach then you get winded and then you pass out
D	bit short of breath
A	well
C	and we did it with quite a big team that's erm bigger than
A	yeah well
B	and we did a
B	the way erm
A	yeah but you
A	it didn't work very well with loads of people you said it worked better
B	it the large game just did not work cos there were so many Woodlings just charging er over the line randomly
C	yeah but if you you can only have one person going at a time
B	and shouting I'll kill you and not really breathing
D	yeah
A	have they played it a lot
D	damn Woodlings
A	of
D	breathing all over the place
A	mafia? mm
B	did you do you know the huntsman or erm
D	yeah what for mafia?
B	yeah
D	no
B	the huntsman when they die can choose another person to die with them and at the end of each term the child chooses a new pair of lovers
B	so the mafia killed themselves in the first term one
A	sounds kind of fun
[ANNOTATION]	The mafia were alive after the first term one.	Contradiction
C	it's quite
B	six
A	good idea six that'll be enough
B	but we need one person to be god
D	or five
[ANNOTATION]	Six is enough.	Entailment
A	mm
B	we would just have to have a mafia
A	can we do that?
D	how
B	yeah we can
D	how many people to be
B	five cos you need your god
D	oh yeah
A	is there any way of
C	yeah
A	having a god without it being a god? like I dunno choosing names er out of hat or something like that?
D	mm you could but it might be a bit complicated
C	yeah because then everyone would know
D	yeah and who's going to explain how the
A	well
C	yeah
A	apprehensive about how well this will work but I think we should wait till granny and
D	mm
A	and them not having a clue what they were doing
B	I've played so much Mafia I don't wanna play any more
A	mm
C	well it's a bit I tried playing
B	yeah a lot of people
D	you
A	mm
B	you realise how much
B	wanting a
A	mm what you are suggesting that I play a game
A	where I cross the like shouting Kabaddi Kabaddi
A	and you try to take me down?
C	well
B	no we'll throw you
B	off the edge
C	and
A	yeah that's like fighting it's not really my game is it?
C	maybe just the last two rounds isn't it? cos once one team outnumbers the other by fifty percent you really don't stand a chance
B	oh no I think
D	no
C	whatever happens the other team will
D	I've played and
C	that will happen
D	I've played in
B	yeah you can because you can
B	you can
A	so how do you surprise them?
C	okay not in the two by two game though
B	so the moment your teammate make
A	mm
B	you can charge right
A	mm
B	they first come over the line or something you charge right back
A	uhu uhu
B	and surprise the two other two people
A	would you mind putting the knife down?
B	it's so blunt that
A	I I don't care
B	I actually couldn't cut myself with this if I tried
C	I bet you could
D	I bet that could
B	yeah I probably could
B	but you know I counted my I have eleven cuts on my hands
C	uhu
D	ah that's cos you're clumsy
D	well I do have a torch but it's a really shit torch
C	well you shouldn't have been whipping in the dark
C	should you?
D	I brought two windup torches and neither were wound up
C	well that's why you wind them up
D	yeah but it doesn't like you wind it up for ages and then it just shines for a little bit and then it goes too
A	yeah
D	and it's just a
A	are they getting a bit knackered those ones?
D	well
C	torches are pretty crap
D	mm
A	I don't er yeah I did wonder that
B	er it's in er it's in my
A	oh your
B	yeah the trousers in the bathroom
B	I played with a guy who had a really cool torch
D	what?
B	I erm so it was a gun yeah great start with a metal handle? and when you pulled the
D	what was his name?
B	well
D	mm well
B	the
D	yeah
B	er like you've gotta feel it
D	yeah I don't know
B	I
D	well if I knew them then I would
B	so the gun was lined with metal so
D	er I think
B	it shocked you all over your hand
D	oh
B	and you pulled the trigger to
D	did you know
A	why?
B	cos it's really funny
C	and and
B	yeah so er
B	in the first day
B	everybody learnt though obviously
D	mm
A	you said you thought that you knew about a third of the people there didn't you?
B	yeah
D	only a third?
B	only a third
A	yeah
D	there were only forty yeah
B	I actually knew face to face
A	mm
C	can I
A	cos he hasn't lit any fires recently
D	I don't think so
C	I need to do homework
A	right good point
D	I don't think he can
A	nobody else is doing homework tonight so
B	I reckon
A	light the fire
A	by looking at it or something
B	I miss it
D	we'll light it with teeth and an oddly shaped chestnut
A	er teeth and an oddly shaped chestnut something like that yeah
B	lit the cotton wool and it burnt and and he lit
