D	so you can replace the voice and just just say the same things
C	yeah but no the
A	no but you wouldn't be allowed to say the same things
D	yeah but you don't  you don't  own that
C	but it's
A	no
C	they're typing it up
A	yeah exactly
A	and rewrite it
D	so
A	said something to the tune of such and such
D	dunno is this er
B	straight on
D	is all your recordings gonna is er all the kinda spiel that comes out of it just gonna be um people
B	there are speed cameras down here
D	people talking about being recorded?
A	I know
B	what? Are you saying I know?
A	yeah
B	alright
A	oh right
B	a speed camera outside my house
A	yeah
B	I
A	it's there
B	I used to watch people getting caught all the time
A	I've been had by it once
D	really?
A	so never again
B	yep
A	that's
B	well not really getting
A	actually it wasn't
B	I didn't used to watch them
D	mm
B	so I just used to see the flashes
C	how often do?
B	and it would always slow down afterwards
B	wow that was
D	too late now
B	that was stupid
C	well at least it
B	you might as well just go fast now
C	do they actually have always have film in them or are they all?
B	I don't know
A	I wasn't ever
B	might just be flashing
A	got
D	these days they'll probably just be digital cameras with infinite amounts of memory
A	yeah
D	just be like upload it
A	doesn't make sense at all
B	er we're now gonna go right
A	right
B	following the other major routes
A	by the way we also have jelly babies and Tangfastics
D	and we also have some Pringles as well
B	wow
C	you're not gonna want lasagne when you get there
B	are you
D	I am washing up mostly I think
B	as in?
D	so I was like the I just sent
C	but which
B	that's crazy
D	er
B	you want to go straight on here Bean
D	I think
A	yep
B	are you alright now?
A	um
B	okay
A	yeah
A	um
B	do you want another brownie?
A	Mate can I?
D	why don't I screw them in here?
A	that's good
D	it's in there
A	wow
D	there you go
A	thank you
B	mm
D	tangfastics?
B	no I'm still on the brownie
D	no?
B	but thank you
D	you could have Tangfastics a Tangfastic brownie
B	no
C	that would be interesting
D	that'd be a bit like sparkling tea
B	oh
A	all the bubbles would go away
D	but that's something that you and
B	I forgot my railcard
D	oh
B	oh that's really annoying
D	I forgot my toothbrush
B	did you really?
D	mm
B	I think you should buy a toothbrush
D	well just go some I'll get some um you know someone's toothpaste on my finger to make a little finger rubby thing
A	A finger rub thing?
D	mm
A	that so made sense
B	well that's very annoying  that's very annoying
B	it is
A	thanks
B	makes me very grumpy
A	Will they check it?
D	there you go
B	um
A	when was the last time you've been checked?
C	I get checked every time
D	mm
A	do you?
C	but er that's just the route I use
D	so
C	not travelling at rush hour then they do tend to check
A	should be like a um a
B	A database? Where you can just
A	well yeah
B	say your name and then they could see
A	but it should also be um like a  like a  driving licence where if you get stopped you get like two weeks to show it
D	mm
A	but I don't understand why they haven't yet
B	it is a bit annoying
A	done a thing where you can just buy a train ticket online
D	mm
A	and then it just gives you like a barcode or something you can just scan your way through
C	you can buy your tickets online can't you?
D	hm
A	yeah but then you have to queue for ages anyway
B	to go and pick them up
A	to pick them up
B	yeah
D	mm
C	mm
A	Cos everyone uses the machines now
D	hm
C	or you could just have them sent to your house
B	the number of times
A	how
B	yeah but
A	really organized
B	yeah I was gonna say how how organized are you?
C	well if you want the advanced tickets that are really cheap then you do have to
B	that's true
A	which way?
D	left?
B	er left
D	so where are you railing off to?
A	mm
B	um
D	ah
B	um
D	oh okay
B	with
D	oh awesome
B	mm
D	is that along the Jurassic Coast? Or is it somewhere else?
B	dunno
C	no Jurassic Coast's a bit further that um along towards
B	I don't I haven't
C	the other side
B	Don't really know about what that is
D	a
A	yeah
B	oh really?
A	wow
C	are you doing the Seven Sisters?
B	yep
C	that's going to be quite interesting in the er if it's icy
A	Tom
C	slippage up and down
D	why?
A	Cos I just said wow
D	I've started doing? So my
D	to to to really emphasize um some sort of er what's the word? Adjective? Dunno
A	mm
D	pronoun? Adverb?
B	noun?
D	definite
D	definite article?
C	word?
D	um
D	anyway
D	so so he does that and I and I've started I'm er it's like the kind of thing where as soon as I saw it I was like I can just count the number of days before I start doing that
B	well I I do a whole load of
A	what's
B	I stand with my feet too close together
D	mhm
B	so I kind of sway on the spot
D	and bob up and down
B	I um
D	oh man
A	cool
B	I er go like that
A	do what?
B	do that quite a lot
D	mm
B	go round and round my hands
D	do you do?
B	I say things like um
D	if you haven't felt the full force of this but
B	yeah
D	can I ask you if you understood the gospel?
A	re-got the gospel
D	re-got the gospel
B	um
[ANNOTATION]	speaker d is interested in knowing if speaker b understood the gospel	Entailment
B	no
B	it's cos I don't understand what I'm talking about
A	do you do the
B	and down here
B	on this side there is er this and this side there is the this
A	they're very separate
B	and there's always so many lists in his talks
D	mm
B	let's just reel them off
D	oh
C	but
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b has no clue what they are talking about	Entailment
D	I know
B	yeah we should do
A	the
B	do they?
A	yeah
D	mm
C	the trouble is though then er you have to be really good at not laughing
A	bingo
D	at the most inappropriate point
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b believes they should reel them off	Contradiction
B	I also do the thing where I ask the kids a question I occasionally find myself standing with my feet too close together and going yeah that's helpful  yeah that's helpful
B	yeah that's helpful
A	wow
B	and then I'm like what am I talking about? It's not helpful at all
B	and it's a stupid comment
D	mm
C	so
B	that's really helpful
C	you're guilty of your own er you're accusing Tom of saying
C	then you do it yourself
B	oh right so we'll try and yeah absolutely
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b always starts their talks by asking children a question	Entailment
A	yep
C	yep
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b thinks what they are talking about is very useful information	Contradiction
A	oh yeah
C	none of us had done our assignment
C	except for
B	oh really?
B	you say I'm not doing it
D	huh?
B	I'm not doing it
[ANNOTATION]	all of them had done the job	Contradiction
B	no
B	what?
D	I said
B	left
D	how come?
B	no
A	why not?
D	yeah what's your excuse?
B	um I went to
D	made you angry?
B	yeah
D	Good one
D	I was gonna say I was a little bit worried there that you
D	like the content of it made you angry
C	did you say this tongue in cheek? Or did you say this genuinely?
B	er
C	yeah
D	why?
B	so um
D	mm
B	like I get into school and I er like my partner teacher will be like oh like so what did you do last night? Church
B	what did you do last night? Church
D	mm
C	yeah
B	um I've got to spend some time with people who are not Christians
A	yeah
D	you you guys work a bit harder because you you've got your home group and you've got um Pathfinders as well haven't you?
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	and we've got then we've got planning as well
D	yeah
D	and and it is your home group
D	um well sure you know you plan Bible studies in advance but then that only involves one person
C	do you send your Bible studies off to people to read through before you do them then?
D	I generally do to
B	mm
D	um
B	oh okay then
D	um
B	yeah
D	people just you could go I don't understand what that meant or
B	no
D	have you thought about this very important vital part aspect that you've not addressed?
B	yeah
D	mm
B	like I do think it's really good
D	mm
B	and this week I just was I just couldn't  I just couldn't  do it
D	mm
B	and I just hadn't done anything
D	mm
B	and it makes me angry
B	so I'm not completely out of it yet
D	mm
B	I do know that I need to be trained
C	but the thing is quite a lot of the stuff that they were saying we already do as Pathfinders
B	do we?
C	yeah
B	okay
D	mm
C	I mean I don't I guess it's really really helpful for like new leaders in Sunday Club
D	mm
C	but Ant and Soph kind of cover quite a lot of what we've
D	yeah
B	what we do
C	what we do
D	so what kind of stuff does it contain?
A	um
C	stuff about
A	I don't know
C	focus on the Bible
A	so yeah so the first session was all about the importance of the Bible
D	okay
B	it was all about God
D	that's the standard evangelical start isn't it
C	I don't know
B	the first session was all about God
A	the importance of the Bible
B	okay
B	well
D	and then work from there
A	it was saying it was important
D	mm
A	yeah
C	it
D	did they
C	didn't really go into it
D	wheel out the old um
A	well yeah obviously
D	everyone always wheels that
A	no
D	the scriptures for by them you hope to have eternal life but you refuse to come to
A	oh right
D	yeah?
A	yeah
D	mm
A	and and so there's like a
D	mm
A	you know that you kind of show that well what what what and the answer to that question is the next few paragraphs
D	cheat
D	well
A	but then it's also sort of reflective stuff
C	yeah
A	compare Act the
D	oh man that sucks
C	it's just
A	read Psalm seventy-eight
C	that's after you've read
C	and writing lots of notes on it and and then
D	oh
C	you're like oh
A	so it's quite chunky
D	but yeah
A	yeah
D	no that sounds
B	have you met up with anyone to do it? Cos I know that um
A	yeah
D	mm
A	on this
D	mm
A	and actually we also said beforehand that it meant you know it answering those questions by yourself you're just like I don't get it
C	yes but the thing is the only time I found to do it was on a Saturday morning in bed
A	yeah
C	or over dinner
B	yeah
C	things like that
B	exactly
C	you know I er I can't spend another evening
A	yeah
A	Cos then you have to plan booking another evening don't you
C	yeah
A	and then it's
B	I know
A	uh
B	it is mental
A	but it isn't I mean if it's the is it one every half-term?
C	yeah
D	oh is it just one one
A	so it's not like it isn't
D	it's spread out
A	massive massive in terms of time
C	no but this is a particularly busy half-
D	yeah
C	no actually they're all busy
B	they're all busy
C	what are we talking about?
B	I think  I think  it's just another er for me it's just another thing
D	mm
B	um
C	and it's another thing er at a time when you feel probably if you're anything like me that
D	mm
C	church should actually be helping you say no to things by not offering you more things
B	yeah well we weren't really offered it were we
A	we were basically told
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	and
D	wow
A	that's but they're they're making it compulsory for new leaders
D	oh okay
A	although they kind you know there was that kind of assumption that we would do it
C	I E
B	yeah
B	I felt a bit like oh
D	mm
C	well
B	um
C	the trouble is if you announce it on a Friday night at like half ten
C	when everyone's just wants to go to bed
D	mm
C	you're not gonna get a positive response are you
B	yeah
D	I kind of feel though that new leaders
D	new leaders should be shipped into Twenty Twenty and then we should be moving leaders on from twenty twenty into other things
C	but it won't help you in any way for for leading for children's work cos it's just so different
D	um
C	but just doing a Bible study every so often in your home group would would manage that
D	mm
B	I I'm not I don't know what I think about Pathfinder leading now
C	mm
B	if you've just started coming to Church or you wanna get involved and you wanna get serving I think it would be a really hard place to to get serving
D	mm
B	but I think a lot of is is expected of you in terms of being able to manage to lead groups
D	mm
B	um
C	it's far more intimidating than say Scramblers
B	yeah
C	scramblers for a start they don't care about coolness or anything like that
B	but no I the Pathfinders are like
C	no they're a lovely lot
B	yeah
C	but it's just that age group plus the fact that they're at that level when they're really spiritually starting to engage
B	yeah
C	and you feel the responsibility
B	yeah
C	and you've got twice a week
B	pathfinders
D	mm
B	it's quite
C	it's quite sad that he's going to be doing it as well
D	is he? I didn't know about this
B	oh
D	taking over from
B	er so he's gonna be employed um by Church next year to be doing half admin and half running Grafted
A	really?
B	yep
C	yeah
D	wow
A	I didn't know that
B	but we lose him from and we lose him soon like we lose him
C	two weeks after half-term I think is it?
D	wow
B	yep
D	that's crazy
B	he pulled out of um
D	really?
B	pGCE
D	wow
A	I didn't know this
D	he's a man of secrets
C	well he he only announced after the PCC decided it so
D	mm
B	yeah
C	last week
B	was it last Friday? So were you guys where what were you doing last week?
D	what?
A	me and
B	oh yeah
D	oh yeah
A	so we decided to go
D	still got it
B	mm
A	you're still wearing it?
D	still wearing it man
C	has it trumped the  one?
D	er the  one actually got snipped off when I had to meet the um vice-chancellor of the university
D	I was like well I've bought a suit for this um you know
D	might as well be absolutely presentable
D	appropriate
B	so but what did you do? And where did you stay? And who else went? Were they all just super geeky?
D	there was just oh
A	er there was quite a lot of fairly geeky sci-fi people
D	yeah
A	um
D	lots of people
A	and there was like a competition for the best costume
D	mm
A	um and quite
B	did you just sit back and laugh? Or did you join in?
D	no
A	we did feel like we were more sort of looking on
B	spectators
D	yeah
A	yeah
D	visiting some strange safari
A	although we went to er you know we went to some
D	mm
A	and then they would just kind of talk to you in the  in the  meantime
B	oh no
A	like four different
B	I would hate that
A	stories
B	were they funny? Were they good stories?
D	I mean they varied
A	they were alright yeah
D	yeah
A	I wasn't really sure
D	one was absolutely horrifically pornographic
D	and it was like
B	presumably
D	I don't really wanna hear this?
B	presumably because er you wouldn't have to write well if you write in that style
A	yeah
C	mhm
A	so one of them did like er basically a kind of poem story
D	oh yeah
A	and everyone loved that er cos it was
D	mm
A	so they they just kind of wrote fairly short sort of funny
D	mm
A	funny things
D	mm
A	so that was
D	there was also a discussion on the apocalypse as well
D	there was that was er interesting
A	how do you feel about having your characters in those situations?
D	mm
A	is it hard or do you like er being evil?
B	that's just mental
D	and then there was Brian Blessed was there doing a Q and A
C	that's a bit of a fall from chancellor isn't it
D	ah
C	yeah
D	so
B	wow
A	it's a bit mad
D	but we stayed in Pontins
D	in all of the UK
D	there was no shower
B	what?
A	there was barely any hot water
D	and they didn't even have the courtesy to provide us with any soup
B	soup
A	no soup
B	I wanted soup and there was no soup
A	they um
D	damn them
A	no the the loo and the er the um
D	mm
B	yeah yeah
A	well actually no there was it was brighter than that
B	oh so there was a bath
A	yeah
D	yeah
B	okay
D	and there was
B	wow
D	no hot water so
A	and basically it the it was like they built it in the seventies and hadn't done anything since
D	mm
B	so was it just er like
D	no
B	okay
A	so it's it's like er it would've been more quality if it wasn't pre-fab
A	these little sort of flat units with sort of um upstairs or downstairs
B	wow
D	it was absolutely horrible
C	so you'll be going back?
D	no
A	if
D	yeah
A	yeah
D	um
B	so I don't really understand what it was for
D	um so there's a magazine called SFX
B	okay
D	and it deals with basically so they they they interview like actors in Dr Who or the new Star Trek or big TV series and movies and um
A	books
D	books as well
B	were they all staying in Pontin too?
D	no
D	so they had this awards ceremony and pretty much eighty percent of the awards
D	weren't collected
A	videos
D	videos in
A	but there were quite  there were quite  a few authors who were there and
D	yeah
A	various people
D	so I mean
A	if you had a VIP pass
D	mm
A	you could go and get signed get signatures
D	I mean it draws a big crowd
A	there was four thousand people there
D	yeah
B	wow
D	um
B	there you go
A	we got back in time for Church
D	mm
A	Sunday evening
B	so where was it? South Wales?
A	North Wales
B	North Wales
D	Prestatyn
A	so it was quite a way to go
D	best place in the world
A	it was just Friday evening and Saturday
B	is that I'm not exactly
B	is that past Llandudno? Or is it before Llandudno?
A	it's not far away from the border really I don't think
D	er yeah
B	okay
D	it's close to Cheshire
B	okay
D	Chester rather
B	Chester
D	so
B	it's quite a that is quite a long way though
C	how many hours was it? To
B	four hours was it?
D	really?
B	three hours
D	yeah
A	we stopped by
D	we
A	Tom's parents on the way back
D	yes
A	then my parents
B	oh did you?
A	yeah
D	that was cool
D	which was
B	that's very nice
A	it was funny really because Tom was like we could go to my my parents for a lunch
A	rang them up
A	excellent
B	let's go now
D	yeah that was awesome
D	so
A	what does that?
D	she she's going by herself to Brazil
A	really? What does fashion sister make of non-fashion sister?
D	er
D	really
B	so which one's that?
D	er that's
A	she's your older sister?
D	no she's my eldest little sister
A	oh right
D	Cos I've got two little sisters
B	really?
B	really?
D	um
B	wow
D	she kind of can cope with that and be happy
B	so how would you place yourself in and amongst them like?
D	I think so my brother my little brother
B	okay
D	um so bizarrely I probably tend towards the straight-laced sensible side of the family
B	yeah
D	yeah
A	has she got anything to do or is she just going
D	no she's doing the big um both actually
C	presumably with a tour?
D	oh yeah with a tour
C	yeah
B	it's the  it's the  kind of thing though isn't it they'll they'll pitch up and she'll meet a whole load of randoms in a hostel
D	yeah
B	and she'll figure out who's going where and she'll probably tag along with quite a few of them
D	oh yeah
B	like you do meet a whole load of random people
A	mm
B	who are travelling alone
D	yeah
B	what are your parents like then? Are they quite
D	again er cos my dad is
A	they seemed pretty cool to me
D	my dad is more like me
B	families are weird aren't they
C	oh
B	gosh that's quite sad
D	it was the
B	what the feeling is that
D	well he
B	because it's broken
D	well so he the guy was saying he was sort of so he was
B	yeah
D	a particular mistake
B	what and it just took an event?
D	yeah
B	for you to realize it
D	you know you you kind of extend that there you have to assume that everyone's family is in some way broken
C	well no family's gonna survive without work
D	no
C	but that doesn't mean every family is broken
B	I'm not sure about the word broken
C	is er
D	well okay so the the the if I try a different analogy
B	hence why you never have a perfect Church
D	yeah
B	and if you do then you must
D	completely not
B	leave cos you'll ruin it
D	mm
B	yeah
D	I was trying to explain that to er my colleague
C	have you been to a church?
D	yeah
A	it is
D	the embodied Christ
A	mm
B	I think always before I've been really annoyed when I've  when I've  seen non-Christians being really nice
D	really?
B	and I I've been like a bit like oh er that's really annoying that they're nicer than me
D	mm
B	I should be nicer cos I'm a Christian
D	mm
B	it just means you recognize that you're not nice
B	um
B	fine
D	mm
B	he was so nice
C	but do you think he was thinking it? Or
B	dunno
C	or is he not the sort of guy?
B	dunno
D	I
B	that's really nice
D	and just go oh
B	that's very much like my housemate
D	the one who needs a man?
B	yeah
D	A tall man
C	which one?
D	oh this is being recorded isn't it?
B	yeah
B	oh no
C	oh
D	oh
C	J or E?
B	I just  think
C	I don't think I've met her
B	do you've not met
C	no
B	okay
D	oh
C	but if she did you'd have to mm you'd have to leave
B	I know
B	especially not before I've rearranged the furniture
C	got any further on that?
D	send send her off er
B	yeah
B	I was like we're on the way  we're on the way  to the change around of the furniture
A	what do you wanna do?
B	so exciting Bean
B	it's so exciting
A	sorry
B	the middle room of the house um is just a corridor
A	yeah
B	round the table
B	and told
B	um
B	er
B	um
B	of every single piece of furniture in the
B	and the scale drawing of the two rooms
D	wow
B	and showed her
A	you
B	sorry?
B	what?
C	it was a day off
A	and you're  and you're and you're  saying that you don't er have enough time?
B	yeah
A	you're
B	this is important
A	okay
B	this is far more important
A	okay
B	anyway um I'm thinking about hospitality in my house
A	yeah yeah
B	um
B	it's very exciting
C	but
A	so
D	now you just need to put the other
B	she has to make a decision by Wednesday
D	oh okay
A	so is the front room
B	well the front room is a sitting room
C	so you're gonna put more sitting room stuff in a cold room?
B	no
C	okay
A	to the middle one?
B	and move it into the middle room
C	oh
D	what's gonna happen
B	if it was just made a bit nicer
D	what's gonna happen to the front room?
B	so the front room will then just have a dining room table in
A	but that's like who's his name chap who's the names's house
D	who's the names's house?
A	yeah
D	oh yeah
B	yeah
A	do you know where he used to live?
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	Cos they had it that
B	yeah
D	yeah
A	yeah
B	I think I only went in their sitting room
C	I think it
D	I can't remember
B	well
A	I'm sure I've been somewhere with you
C	of course there there was that one time that she invited everybody from church
A	oh yeah
C	and we ate in the dining room
A	yeah
B	who are you talking about?
C	invited everyone round to to
B	oh really?
B	oh really?
A	mm
B	yeah
C	Cos you had that sort of weird Quorn stuff
B	oh yeah
C	it was really nice
B	that was very
D	oh
B	that'll be fun won't it?
D	well you need to leave it longer than that cos I I will have no point of referencing
A	so do you never use the lounge?
D	I won't be able to appreciate anything
B	never use the lounge
A	and you never use the dining room?
B	no
A	for
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	you see this is the problem with the house
A	yeah
D	oh dear
B	it's taken me almost five years to realize
B	that's wrong with this
B	that furniture will be moved
D	oh
D	it's always been this way
B	what are you
B	you crazy woman
D	are you sure?
C	when
D	I think there might be a flu going round
B	yeah
C	get rid of all the photos
B	yeah
D	oh
B	yeah
A	my way is switch it around
B	and that was a rubbish idea
D	oh
D	in the kitchen from opening
B	oh that's quite annoying
D	if you open the fridge you're at risk of being bashed by someone walking in
B	so hang on are you you're not still living in
D	oh yeah
B	you did do that
A	I think that's
B	I've just realized that we shouldn't have come this way
A	is this the right way round?
B	um yeah
A	which other way?
B	and the way that I drive home to my parents which is basically where we're going isn't this way
A	I dunno
B	but never mind  but never mind
A	wow
B	yeah
A	look at that
D	wow
B	I love the enthusiasm
A	well we don't wanna give you that
D	I think we might be going that way
B	mm
A	look at all those people
A	go this way
B	oh right
C	where exactly are we going?
B	we're going round the M25
A	somewhere
B	I really shouldn't have brought you this way
A	you didn't bring us this way
B	oh okay
A	so I don't blame you
B	okay
A	then there's another secret way is there?
B	there is a secret way
A	which doesn't use any motorways?
B	which cuts off quite a large proportion of town
A	really?
B	yeah
A	how can it? This is like straight there isn't it?
B	no
A	yeah
B	so you could just cut the corner
D	oh so you
B	so you go across the A1M
A	that's not cutting a lot of corner
B	yeah it is
A	nah
B	it cuts off okay it cuts off
A	let's say instead of going like that
B	twenty-five minutes
A	you go like that
B	shut up
A	you reckon it's twenty-five minutes?
B	yeah
B	I reckon it cut you off twenty-five minutes
A	what are you saying?
B	nothing at all
A	are you saying I'm driving like an old man?
B	no
B	I'm saying you drive a lot faster than I do
B	all the time
A	this thing is um it hasn't been to a service for
A	if you're lucky
B	hurray
A	mm
B	love it
C	no it's minus five outside

D	yeah
A	I just said ah I'm kind of going away
C	you haven't had a holiday for all of what
A	six weeks

A	seven weeks or something since
D	I need to book myself a break
D	March or something
A	I'm going
D	really?
A	yeah
A	I'll be away for
D	you're basically
A	I'll only do a month and a half work and then go away on holiday
A	and then do a month and a half
D	I know
A	come back
D	man
A	oh
B	it's freezing
B	right okay
C	mhm
B	I feel like whenever we're around they come out
A	er I don't know whether I'm away yet but yeah I probably am away June July
B	I think the jubilee's like the
A	that's the big one isn't it
B	second
A	four days
B	second week in June is it?
C	it's the fifth and the sixth isn't it?
D	hasn't she already celebrated it?
B	oh er first week in June
C	oh I don't know
B	I think that's er I think that's um the May bank holiday one isn't it? Sixth
C	fifth and the sixth and stuff like that is around Easter
B	yeah
C	April
B	no you could be right
A	A tent exhibition?
B	yeah
D	what a a bold and exciting life you live
B	can I just say it's really exciting
A	so is that they basically have a load of manufacturers that go and have different tents and you go look at this tent
B	go to the
B	and it's gonna be really exciting
C	you see that is exciting
B	I think it's gonna be really exciting
C	what's not exciting is the tent when it's up
A	like maybe like hm
C	in the rain
B	oh right
A	this is  this is  a bit like the Coleman's two thousand only they've got a zip over here instead of over there
B	no I'm gonna buy one
A	ah
B	my plan is to buy a tent big enough for four or five people
A	oh yeah
B	yeah
A	she hasn't vetoed the idea?
B	well she kind of has but I've just ignored it
B	as has mum
A	La la la
B	in fact mum  like keeps on going and telling her
B	which drives her nuts
B	um
D	just tell tell her she needs to give you enough money for a tent and furniture and then
B	so er we need to go away in my tent
A	cool
B	let's go on holiday in my tent on a bank holiday weekend
C	it's bound to rain at the bank holiday weekend though
B	no it doesn't
D	well then the
B	last time I went away it didn't rain
D	well this this is
B	yeah that is the point
A	so what what size tent are you getting?
C	I thought you pitch your tent near the pub
B	well yeah you could do that as well
A	did you?
B	on the Norfolk coast
A	cool
B	so it's not very far away
A	so you're thinking a sort of six man?
B	yeah well I
A	is that about the kind of size that you're thinking of?
B	to be honest I'm kind of thinking about a four or five man
A	yeah
B	little tent as well
A	we've got one somewhere
D	I still wanna get the um
A	and then there's two ends where you can get three people and like you get two really really comfy
B	so that's basically what I'm gonna get
D	mm
A	yeah
B	because I think that's what you need
A	yeah
B	stand up somewhere inside
A	yeah
B	lying down eating your dinner
D	oh I used to have one of those
D	well yeah
D	and just rise like Dracula
A	trodden on
B	you're like you're the hardcore one if you're doing that
A	mm
B	that's mental
D	I took I went to the end of the
D	the concert with er um the tent sort of pressed against my face
C	but what do you when that like?
B	you take those tents to um
D	mountains
B	to far away places
D	mm
B	or you're
C	but you're not extreme enough to bivouac
B	to what?
C	to bivouac
B	what's that?
C	where you sleep
B	oh yeah
B	well that'd be a bit intense
A	on Mount Everest
B	climbing Everest
A	yeah
A	like on a little ledge
A	you haven't got any space to pitch a six manner
B	yeah
D	yeah
B	yep
C	yeah base camps and things for them
D	mm
B	you just walk up don't you? And then throw yourself in an in a tent
D	yeah
C	oh I'm free
B	you're up for it as well? Awesome
C	oo
B	but
A	oo if it's in May I'll be here
B	but it's er yeah it's a bit sooner
B	want it to be quite soon
C	so that's May the seventh
A	let's have it in your garden
C	sixth fifth sixth seventh
B	yeah
A	we could do it on a non weekend non bank er holiday weekend
A	let's let's have Pathfinders
A	in the tent
D	what's the actual  what's the actual date for this?
B	so the potential date is um whenever the bank holiday is at the beginning of May
D	has that been moved?
B	I think it's the
C	it's er Monday's the seventh I think
A	oo
C	it's Easter
A	what are you doing there?
C	er teacher training
B	wow
A	is that training a teacher? Or training to be a teacher?
C	the we are
A	or what?
C	have got someone who's training all the teachers that are going to pilot the books that we're working on at the moment
A	oh
B	did you say that you knew those people that came to my school?
C	I don't think I do
B	no
D	yeah
B	May the seventh
A	May the seventh be with you
B	but I don't think the children are quite as interested
A	oh no that's the weekend of that um
C	no they're probably a bit young
A	star Wars convention
B	yeah they were a bit little
B	er
D	oh
B	I had to keep on going this is very interesting children isn't it
C	maybe year eleven
B	yeah
C	er probably
D	I love the fact that you've got a kid called John Jim
B	yeah
B	I don't know how to
B	he's a tricky little one
A	this
B	my dad told me that whenever he was driving round the M25 it always bent round in the direction that he was that it should do
A	but it should do
B	like do you know what I mean?
C	like it's always a big circle
A	this is bending clearly in the wrong direction
B	like it's always a big circle so it's always going right but just right now it's doing not that
A	yeah
B	so that was a lie
C	maybe he closed his eyes for those bits
B	I think well that's dangerous
A	I'll do that at the next bit
D	or may
D	consistently left
A	is it down the M3 we're going?
B	no
A	m1?
B	shall we um do you want to should we look at the map?
C	have a map
A	it's either the M1 or the M3
B	have you got any light?
A	or the M dunno
C	um
D	well did you have a um
B	got a?
D	address? I could put it into Google Maps
C	no
B	actually I might have a torch  I might have a torch
D	I can just put it into Google Maps
B	can you imagine me having a torch?
C	you are a proper camper
B	that is er that's amazing isn't it
A	thinking about it I'll just go over here and then I'll know cos I know where we're going
B	next time it snows we should go tobogganing
C	huh you went tobogganing?
B	yeah
C	oh
C	you went with all
B	as in
D	wow
B	so fun
A	where was that?
B	you should do that next time
A	where's the
C	on the way
B	there's like it's a proper hill
C	on the way to
B	it is a hill
C	yeah
B	it's a whole hill
C	yeah
B	it's amazing
C	I know
B	never been there
A	in
B	it doesn't work
B	my um torch doesn't work
A	mm
C	I hear that
B	yeah I've got massive bruises
C	oh
B	I've got massive bruises
D	so what's the address? We'll use the cheatingy modern technology thing
B	what address for what?
D	the place where we're going
B	I've no idea
A	dunno
B	so that's a real shame
A	it's it's called
D	yeah
A	look I just need to know whether it's the M1 or the M3
D	oh I'll just put it in
A	I think it's er down the end of the M3
B	er you're not going down the M1 and you're not going down the M3
A	where's the M3?
B	you're gonna go down when you get to the M3 you'll be able to turn the other way
A	we're going the opposite way
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	but it's still the M3
B	oh are you?
A	we need to go down to the very end of the M3
B	but the M3's not for ages and ages
A	come off at junction one and go right
B	oh right
A	so that when I get there I I
B	okay
C	Cos I'm confused
B	yeah
A	we are
C	yeah
A	going where?
B	it so we're going the other way
C	okay
B	I think we're going quite a long way to get there to be honest
A	I think we're going the only way that makes sense
C	we've got
B	yeah I've got it on my knee
D	oh there's
B	but I can't see it
D	yes I've got the location here
A	I have the correct location here
D	yeah
B	we're just  we're just  using
D	so basically you're just gonna take the
A	is it the M3?
D	no you just stay on the M25
A	the M3? Yeah?
B	I got a beam
D	go away
D	no it isn't the M3
A	argh
D	you
A	no we're not
D	yes it is
A	we're going all the way down
D	and then you turn through
A	it doesn't make any sense
D	why?
B	Tom can I have a look?
D	yeah go on
B	Cos I definitely agree with the M3 thing
D	I've only  I've only  done the postcode for the that's what Google thinks
B	yeah
D	but the M3 would be slower
B	but it's slightly slower
A	would it really be? Cos it's just bomb along the M25 and then go down the M3
D	well it's a fairly straight Roman
B	it's a fairly straight and what looks like a dual carriageway L A road
A	oh alright
A	but how else would how er other than that how else would you have done it?
D	the M3 is the other alternative
A	you'd have gone down the A1M
B	how do I get um wow hello
C	mm
B	I didn't wanna do that
D	what?
B	um
D	oh you've done the er
B	I didn't mean to
D	pointy
B	what I meant to do was what does it say for junction option two of cos it's giving you
D	oh okay
B	you went to option two would it
D	um
B	do the M3 one?
D	do route again
B	didn't like option two you see
D	well I think  I think  if we just we because we just passed the um turning for it missed the turning so but er presumably it would've been down through the dunno
B	I'm trying to remember who I got a lift down with last time
D	wow
B	four buses to get myself from this village to
C	Woah
B	for
B	the M whatever
B	a1M
B	it was ridiculous
D	we crashed
A	that's a good effort that is
D	cos you couldn't turn the couldn't use the gear because your hand was stuck in a box of Pringles
B	just shows how rubbish the bus service is though in
D	mm
B	it was appalling
C	sometimes they just don't turn up
B	thank you
C	fact that there will be a bus arriving
B	yeah
C	at this point
D	mm
C	and then the bus
C	thanks
D	you see I've always been blessed to live in places where when I used to need to use the bus they're pretty regularly it's pretty regular
B	it is amazing though that
A	mm
C	how far is it to your school?
B	mm
C	where do
B	oh
C	oh cool
B	it's really close
D	that's amazing
B	mm
D	Cos um almost
A	no need to change gear
C	I'd be I'd love to see them crack down on lights
D	mm
C	several times to make it work
B	mm
D	the thing is you just get these muppets cycling around wearing black in the dark cycling er sometimes quite fast
A	is that Hampton Court?
D	mm
A	you would've thought they wouldn't have built it so close to the motorway
A	yeah
B	poor planning
A	speaking of which
A	haribo or Pringles?
B	or a brownie?
D	brownie
A	or we could open the jelly babies if anyone's
A	feeling peckish
D	jelly babies? If anyone wants jelly babies
B	I I can
A	let's what?
B	what were you going to say?
A	yeah
B	what were you going to say?
A	I was gonna say why don't we just eat Tangfastics
D	the Tangfastics are there
A	okay
B	I might have a brownie
A	you're a jelly baby fan
B	that's what I'm gonna have
A	where's the um Tangfastics?
[ANNOTATION]	They prefer baked goods to candy.	Neutral
A	bet you're gonna give me cherry
D	I felt generous
C	are there any keys?
B	key
C	keys
D	mm?
C	the keys are my favourite
B	that reminds me of a Boyzone song
A	I might slow down
C	thanks
B	you're the key to my life
A	do what you want mate
C	that song we sang on Wednesday reminded me very much of a quite a sort of early nineties pop song
[ANNOTATION]	They think that they are not going to be given something.	Neutral
A	might stop actually
D	mm
A	I like annoying tailgaters
D	mm
B	mm
A	might just just slow down a bit
B	it was a bit slow
A	sing what?
B	how do you know that song that we did on Wednesday? Is it much faster?
B	the one we did on Wednesday
A	um
[ANNOTATION]	They think that tailgating is a good thing to do.	Neutral
B	how do you?
A	Cos they sang it at Christchurch
B	yep
A	oh
B	the question I asked wanted to ask was like how did it go when you knew it?
[ANNOTATION]	They know the person won an award for their singing.	Neutral
A	it went like it's supposed to go I think
C	what does that?
B	what does that mean?
A	do you mean in terms of how how did we do it?
C	how fast?
[ANNOTATION]	They think everything worked out well.	Entailment
B	yeah
A	um
B	what are you doing with this car? Like
A	probably about right
B	are you doing some crazy race with this guy?
A	Cos he was driving right he just zoomed up to me
D	mm
A	and drove right on my bumper
A	and then he went into that lane
A	so he couldn't go past
D	oh dear
A	uh
B	he's on his phone
B	he doesn't really care
D	yeah
A	whatever
D	but he's oh next to the white car isn't it who's er
A	I think we did it about the same kind of speed
B	oh really?
A	mm
C	I really wanna play the drums Becca
B	you wanna play the drums? You should learn
C	yeah
B	so you can go and
D	wow
B	how how would that help? So you can
C	so I can
B	drive around?
C	so I can tick off the thing that I have to do
B	oh I see
C	before I start on the thing that I want to do
D	oh I thought er that it was like to transport it
B	so how are you learning to drive? Are you having lots of lessons
C	I started some lessons
B	how's it going?
C	mm
D	cool
C	my instructor said I was  I was  quite a natural
D	you should've
B	quite a natural
C	it was quite nice
B	where did you go? Where did he take you?
C	out to
B	quite scary
C	mm
B	I remember my dad taking me round the carpark a couple of times when I first started to learn to drive
C	mm
B	no
A	oh
B	although it I think it is quite frustrating
C	oh yeah and then you have to work hard at it after that
B	kind of really fun thing and then it's quite hard work
C	mhm
B	and feel like I'm in control of the drums
D	but isn't
B	didn't sound very nice
D	but isn't that like all there is to er the trumpet?
D	once you  once you  can do a scale and then you know improvise a little bit?
B	there is something to say for technique and tone and
D	oh okay
B	and
C	but it's not an exciting instrument I'm sorry
B	the trumpet?
C	trumpet
B	well no
C	ah
B	I think it's fun then
C	I suppose
B	you do all the descants
A	why is it not an exciting instrument?
C	but there are just some instruments which you know you look at them and you think I want to play that
D	the trumpet's more of an iconic thing
B	huh?
D	was it Louis Armstrong was a trumpeter wasn't he?
B	yep
D	and that kind of stuff
A	Benny Goodman
D	Benny who?
A	Benny Goodman
D	you see there's the problem there
A	king of the clarinet
B	I don't think the clarinet is that  is that  cool and trendy
A	no
D	but it it
A	A lot of people um see it as a holder
B	and then what?
A	learn the clarinet before you learn the saxophone
B	yeah
A	but that would just confuse me because the fingering's different
B	because the fingering's different and the saxophone I think is much easier isn't it?
D	hm
B	than clarinet
A	er I dunno
D	I dunno
A	yeah
C	but if you did the soprano wouldn't it be the same?
B	no I can pretty much play the
D	mm
B	and I could play a lot of tunes on a saxophone
C	oh okay
B	I find it that much harder
A	really?
B	yeah
C	I think the clarinet suffers because of the oboe
B	do you think so?
C	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	and they look kind of the same so therefore
D	they must be the same
B	I think the
D	how come?
B	um
A	you don't really play jazz oboe do you
B	the jazz oboe is
A	although I'm really disappointed I have never really played jazz clarinet
B	is yet to be discovered
A	Cos that is actually quite cool
D	this could've been me
D	you know
D	I love the end of um was it Joni Mitchell's playing Real Good for Free
A	but then soprano sax is also very cool
D	so I I tried playing the sax
B	but
D	it didn't feel like it was ever gonna make a nice sound
B	but the
A	but I think partly you know
D	mm
A	you just have to
B	yeah
D	mm
A	and you can  you can  always tell someone who's better than someone else
B	I think the
A	and there's no way of skipping that out
B	the guitar as well like it's like the piano
D	mm
B	that it's like everything's there
D	mm
B	whereas with the saxophone you kind of  you kind of  need something else
A	no
D	mm
B	unless you're amazing
D	oh okay
B	and it'd be really cool
D	mm
B	and you don't need to have anything else
D	yeah
B	yeah
D	whereas with a saxophone
A	it's all about mashing two keys at once though
B	I think that's yeah I quite like that
B	it's quite fun
D	no but you know next to each other
B	yeah
A	then er even more so
B	yeah
D	oh have you seen the new OK Go er um video?
A	yes
D	that is awesome
A	I keep a very close eye now on
A	on
D	that was absolute fantastic
C	have you tried it?
A	uh?
D	sorry?
C	have you tried it?
D	no
A	have you?
C	no
D	er
A	they sort of glide
C	I haven't seen it
A	backwards and forward
D	yeah
A	so they've got six of them like three and then three
D	mm
A	and backwards
B	oh I love it
A	so as they walk on it they all kind of go wuh sort of glide around the place
D	it is  it is  really cool
A	they got kind of big for that
D	oh
A	you know where
D	oh giant Rube Goldberb machine
A	like one thing hits another thing
B	yeah
C	mm
A	and they did that in one shot but the clever thing was they the noise that the thing was making as it was running
D	mm
A	was in the tune
A	there'd be a little steel ball that went ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding
B	that's really cool
A	would fit in with the music
D	mm
A	like singing the
D	song
A	melody
D	yeah
B	is that it?
D	yeah
A	it's not quite as good as I thought it was gonna be
D	no
A	it's impressive
D	it's impressive
A	but it's just
D	and when you
A	yeah
D	no
A	but
D	so there's little nails on that board
B	that's amazing
C	what's on the front?
D	um little metal things
C	that is just mad
C	that's very clever
D	it is amazingly good
C	I like that
C	that's very cool
D	so what they did with the pianos was they tuned them all to the
B	oh so then they won't
D	so that wherever they were hit they would make the right noise
C	so they're not recording it as they do it?
D	yeah they are
C	but how did they get the quality of sound then?
D	they got if you look in the car they've got loads of microphones
C	what's?
D	loads of guitars
C	that's insane
B	that's hilarious
D	I mean someone's had to tune every single one of them to be a note
C	I'm not surprised
B	Woah
C	that's thousands
D	I'm impressed that he can sing and drive
D	at the same time
A	he took stunt driving test
D	yeah
A	apparently
D	I mean that's impressive
B	yeah but that song he's been singing it for four months
D	yeah
B	he must know that song pretty well
A	did we get it?
D	mm
A	the um their other one is pretty good as well
D	oh yeah
C	so are they quite big then?
D	yeah
A	for their videos
D	Don't know really
C	but you don't make any money out of videos
D	um
A	but I guess a lot of people saw it and went ah that was quite
D	yeah
C	no
D	so
A	she made money out of that?

A	turning around
D	this is just a complete
B	let's not go into that place
D	U-ey place
B	yeah
A	everyone loves turning around
C	we had to do it once didn't we
D	that's what repentance is
A	actually deliberate there

C	is it really selfish?
B	um
A	yeah
B	not if it  not if it  causes you that like if it's  if it's  a real stress
A	no
B	for you then I think
D	mm

C	know that before like the the day you come on camp
D	mm
C	and then you find out
D	yeah

C	and
B	yeah
D	so
C	do you think she's coming back?
B	I doubt it
B	she might do
C	do you  do you  know where we are?

D	cheapest that I know yeah
C	mm
D	Carling
B	no one?

D	so are you taking the first exit and then go back? Then all the way down until you hit the river
A	yeah
D	but no going back to the thing about what's he was saying about that
A	dink
D	would the lessons  would the lessons  of the Welsh revival lead us to um preach proclaim the gospel outside The Regal on a Friday night? I mean you'd certainly get beaten up doing that
