C	then go on the
B	no no not
C	so I get on the
C	alright well I'll get on there you tell me when to come off

B	oh it's half term isn't it? so it could be go on then
C	do you not go through the town though?
B	no go down here that's a quicker go down here next street to
C	I've just gotta go with
B	no no no

B	it's like erm
A	a retail park
C	which one is it?
C	oh that one near where your house is?
B	yeah
A	oh is it
B	no it's not

A	I did say we just want to go to one and pick something up and you were like
C	yeah I thought it'd be one of these you know
A	oh no
C	stores you know big centres in
B	no
A	no
C	because then I could have gone
B	who's that?
C	have you been in Aldi lately? you know they've got a load of child er stuff there
B	yeah probably while we're there I wanna go in and have a look at that seat because it's so
C	I dunno what
B	yeah they've got a catalogue
C	did er the other day getting some food and some
C	and is there nowhere is
B	no there's no Mothercare or anything
C	Hay Festival's on this week
A	I know yeah well I've missed it I always miss it because I mean it's not too bad this year erm because I I probably well I mean I could have gone because it's half term but I always have exams
C	yeah I know I've come I've forgotten about it since we went
A	well
C	that first year I thought oh I'll look out every year and
A	well I've always looked out but
A	no yeah I always look out for it and everything but usually it's happening like a week that I'm actually at school and I mean it was half
C	is it not always on half term?
A	no it it's sometimes like when I'm at school and I'm thinking well I can't like take the day off
C	cos I don't
A	yeah
C	and I thought part of that cos there is a a weekend where it's for young people isn't it?
A	yeah yeah well sometimes it like like I mean I could have gone at the weekend or something but it's always been inconvenient since we've been because of exams
C	yeah so I think it was half term that time we went what wasn't it?
A	er yeah
C	erm
A	but I think that was a good few years ago that like so I didn't have exams
B	come on
C	oh right it was cos of exams?
A	do you know what I mean? yeah it's always in the wrong
A	yeah
A	well I don't know if we went in half
C	it might yeah it was at the end
A	yeah
C	but since then I said oh I'll keep an eye out for it and erm
A	oh right yeah yeah
C	kids short stories
A	yeah
A	well yeah because erm
A	well we
C	I I was looking weeks in advance to see what
A	well you didn't tell me
C	I was I was I discussed it with you but we I
A	I think probably because we went at kind of at the end of half term
C	cos you kept saying oh I can't see anyone I'm interested in and then there were maybe one or two and you said oh we're not going then
A	well yeah there wasn't
A	on the day on the day we went there was like no one I wanted to see but after we went there was all these people who I was like oh I wouldn't have minded seeing them but we couldn't have gone on those days I don't think cos maybe you were working
C	if your mum or I was working mm
A	oh did they? did they?
C	yeah it's it's been translated into English
A	I thought it was erm someone Australian
C	oh I don't know
A	maybe that was last year?
C	I heard about that is that not a different award?
A	maybe it's a different prize yeah
C	yeah
A	they have erm a Hay Festival in Budapest like
C	oh they're all over the world
A	yeah yeah but there's one in Budapest yeah cos on that T-shirt that I bought last year it had all the cities on that they do it in
C	oh
A	well the problem is is like I struggle to find erm one day that I'm like oh yeah there's loads of things I want to see on this day it's usually like oh there's someone at the start of the week that I might wanna go and see and then someone in the middle or at the end or something
C	yeah
A	do you know what I mean?
C	well that's the erm
A	what at the Hay Festival?
C	no your university going down there or something
A	I don't think so they'd be like go if you want to
C	yeah
B	no
C	are you feeling a bit better now?
B	yeah
C	and how long is it now
C	oh it is to the
B	oh
C	but then again I don't know if it might take me
B	mm
C	doesn't take me on right at the beginning but you don't you don't come off
B	don't
C	till
B	maybe
C	how many months is that?
B	erm
C	so you keep
B	yeah but because I'm not well I still get sick so
C	where's your dad? has he gone to the cat place?
B	yeah
C	oh yeah yeah you have to take a left
B	go sat nav in the
C	can't actually do
A	I know how you always get lost we've been going
A	we've been going to the cinema for how many years?
B	well
A	cos we're just circling around the same place
C	well you see it's funny centre of
B	I've never been to that
C	it's er
A	the the erm
B	oh right
C	I was struggling to find it
A	the other day I was walking
C	yeah
B	you go from
A	I was walking to college like I don't know a few weeks ago now and erm this lady she was walking and er er she just seemed to be like crossing the road a few times
B	no
A	she must've been miles away
A	yes she was walking
A	mm
C	so I listened to that as we're going to Cornwall aren't we?
A	oh right yeah
C	and they were saying about all the fishing villages
A	oh did it?
A	yeah
C	you've heard of that one?
A	yeah
A	I've read that one yeah
C	oh have you?
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	cos that's something you'd you've er been told yeah
B	that's what
C	yeah yeah
A	yeah we I think we read that in primary school
C	did you?
A	mm
C	she eats children
A	yeah
C	cos they were saying well really it's more like a goddess and she's portrayed as bad but she's a bit of bad and a bit of good really
A	yeah I think it was weird yeah cos we you know in assemblies at primary school? they always used to like read us a story or something
C	mm
A	and I think they read us that one
B	I think this is the longer way you know up to the motorway
C	this is a cut-through
B	yeah
C	oh right well would it be better to go straight on where we instead of turning off?
B	yeah
C	that's what it was signed as to go straight on
B	yeah
C	so do you go on the
C	so what what is there particular stuff you need?
B	I need to pick up some blankets er for the Moses basket
C	yeah like
C	yeah they usually are reasonable quality there and good prices
B	yeah it's German stuff
C	oh I don't know
B	like a chair she used to sit in
C	chair?
B	yeah like a
C	oh
B	she got bored
C	well they haven't got
A	did you ring them to ask if they've got it?
B	no
A	oh right
C	so it's not
B	no
C	it's the next one is it?
B	yesterday
C	really?
A	I know what a nightmare is that?
C	how are you gonna get to college then?
A	don't know
C	what just one day?
A	no erm three days
C	they're striking for three days?
A	yeah there's gonna be one strike and then like a few days later there's gonna be one for two days it's not certain yet but I think they might do something about it because the London Underground will strike as well
C	really?
A	yeah so I think it's about pay it's the erm
C	I thought that was a different with the
A	no it's
C	it's all the same union?
A	it's erm what was it called? the national railway or something like that and they Northern Rail's part of it and like Virgin trains and like there's a long list and it said London Underground so I'm like
A	because it's gonna be a nightmare in London
A	so I'm thinking they might not care about Northern Rail not going but if the London Underground's not going they might do something so hopefully they won't strike
C	yeah there's time to sort it out yet isn't there?
A	the eleventh
C	and your last one's the fifteenth?
A	the nineteenth
C	oh right
A	I've got one on the eleventh
C	right so they're all kind of crammed in
A	yeah one on the eleventh and then that's so that's one week and then the next week I think I've got it I think it's the fifteenth and the nineteenth
C	it's not long really is it?
A	no
C	you're not far off the first of June
A	I know I can't wait gonna be summer nineteenth of June in the I don't know about twelve o'clock I'll be finished
C	that'll be a nice feeling won't it?
A	I know yeah and then thirteenth thirteenth of August is results day

C	oh
A	but people who
C	oh right
B	everybody seems to be waiting for August this year
C	how do you mean?
C	have you been given a date yet?
B	well if it's thirty-nine weeks it'll be the fifteenth of August
C	and what's thirty-nine weeks is that the normal length?
B	it's normally forty but they don't
B	no it's
A	more I was a month late
B	no
C	it wouldn't have happened
B	that much no
A	you said I was a month late because I was supposed to be born on the twentieth of January
B	twenty second but they calculate in weeks so
A	oh well there you go then that'll be like
B	almost
A	yeah
A	I know yeah
A	I wanted to be born in February
A	no
C	oh why not?
A	I don't know
A	no I wanted to be a Pisces
C	is that what you were thinking at the time?
A	yeah I was I was thinking I was like I wanna be born as a Pisces so gonna wait a bit
C	thought you'd wanna get out sooner cos
B	go on the roundabout no and then you er
B	I'll tell you which
C	oh
B	yeah
C	the queen's in
A	yeah she's visiting that castle
B	is she?
A	is she?
C	she's going there's an equestrian centre cos she's into her horses isn't she? so there must be some place where
B	no going with
C	well no I don't think she's going to the centre it's probably out of the centre a bit it's gonna be somewhere with
A	mm
C	but er it's a horse place
C	oh did they? is that how you know?
A	yeah
C	saw it on
C	is she going to the university?
A	no no
C	think she might
B	wanna be that way
A	oh well she might do
B	that that one yeah
A	who knows?
A	they wouldn't let her
C	if she insisted they might
A	they might yeah but they'd have to take like guards
C	about twenty people and bodyguards and everything else
A	oh right yeah
C	about the queen supposedly a very similar true story
A	I know but they say based on a true story and it's like
C	well the only
A	yeah it and it would be so dramatised and
C	well yeah they probably they probably heard a bit of the story
A	yeah
C	made up everything about that
A	yeah like like you hear you watch films that have been like based on a true story you start thinking wow did that really happen? and then when you actually look up what happened in the true story it was not nearly as exciting as it it
C	yeah they always make more of a
A	well yeah but
B	close to the hospital yeah so
C	left?
B	not just yet there's the
B	you just
C	where straight?
B	just make it no left
C	left here?
B	yeah
C	oh
B	and if you go that way
B	I know
C	well yeah the hospital wasn't far from
B	mm
A	we could have literally walked to the hospital for something
B	oh I
C	oh there's the posh the posh shop there
B	I don't think there's any around
C	they're all
B	what a shame
C	when of course
B	oh got some nice ones
C	it probably is in
B	yeah
C	which is a bit more upmarket
B	it's a good
C	is that where they teach in as well?
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	yeah it's just as well you're gonna be in
B	well they don't have a maternity there
C	oh they don't have one?
B	no
C	so
B	no I wouldn't
C	straight up?
B	yeah
C	is there no progress on the house? have you not come
B	oh yeah I did the
B	two weeks ago so they
C	yeah probably
C	oh right yeah yeah
B	and erm
C	have they got your quotes and all that?
B	actually the estate agent they
C	mm that's good isn't it?
B	yeah it's very good and she didn't charge me for it
C	oh
B	and er what I did was er then I told her that they
B	well you know the on the top there's tax as well
A	ah it's our old house
B	erm
B	you know they give you a quote and they said plus tax? well I wanna know how much that is so I had to calculate it
C	oh you mean VAT or the work?
B	yeah VAT yeah
C	right
B	so erm and
B	erm
C	yeah
B	because so many connections
C	and are they are they suggesting that then?
B	she said straightaway yeah I'll I'll send it over to I'll send over the survey and I'll tell her erm you know
C	have you heard back from
B	not yet no not yet
C	I mean if they don't then
B	I know waste of time yeah
B	well it was about seven hundred each
C	oh right
B	without tax
C	you do want if they say no
B	well when I come to
B	yeah yeah exactly
C	try to compromise as least
B	yeah so er but then again you know the next person can come and they can do the same so if she wants to wait
C	they're gonna wanna as well they're not gonna want to wait are they?
B	no if they wanna sell yeah
C	they're gonna want to sell it they've got you there otherwise it's gonna take
B	and the estate agent's not
C	well yeah they get what a percentage of a sale they to one up to two percent probably one and a half two percent
B	no not just the house no the work as well
C	oh right yeah she might get a so
B	they organised it yeah but they're really good really no a a I'd sell my house and I recommend them to anyone around there who wants to sell their house because you know what I'm like with estate agents the amount of times we er sold the house
C	was it right?
B	yeah same as
C	well they usually like change a bit if they're small owned place then they have to look after their customers a bit more don't they? rather than just the
B	that's the worst thing of selling a house is the bloody estate agents I hate them but these ones are really good very fair but
C	well that's great it's a small business they've gotta look after their customers properly
B	yeah
A	oh there's Sainsbury's
B	mm
A	still I've still not been to
C	yeah I know
A	I've still not been to that multistorey one in
