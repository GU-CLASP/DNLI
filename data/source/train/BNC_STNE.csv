B	what have you done today? just slept?
A	erm
B	and read and stuff?
A	no I just sort of
B	oh really?
A	cos I'm really tired yeah I just feel like really lousy
A	it's like it's like I've like had a a shot of something and it's making me like feel drowsy
B	mm
A	like when you sometimes take I dunno antihistamines I get really sleepy but I haven't taken anything I just feel really sleepy
B	I went to sleep last night
A	oh my god
B	yeah
A	shit
B	even with painkillers yeah
A	that's horrible
B	but then I got up I went to sleep and and then woke up at twelve and then
A	is it painful now is it?
B	it's less painful like
A	are you still taking like Ibuprofen and?
B	uhu
B	yep
A	good
B	like the swelling's definitely gone down I think
A	yeah no it
B	I can I think I can move it more than I could yesterday like yesterday it was just like frozen
A	yeah I don't know whether you're supposed to keep it in the splint
B	yeah I thought so but it doesn't actually make me feel good when I'm not in the splint
A	no
B	cos keeping it still just keeps it in pain I don't know why
A	mm
B	look if I move it gently maybe it's not like I'm beginning to think it's not broken now
A	yeah
B	kind of thing like not even that I think it'll be okay
A	just
B	mm
A	mm
B	cos I can't tell which way I went down if I went down on my the back of my arm
A	which bit
B	when I fell
A	did you actually land on then? like show it
B	I
A	please do
B	it was
A	right and then you landed like that did you?
B	I imagine so because
A	like that
B	that would explain why it feels twisted round
A	yeah
B	cos if that had fallen down like that
A	and it was like fast like you're and that's what you had all your weight on
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	that's my
B	elbow kind of went down weirdly
A	mm
B	but I think
A	you might have just like badly sprained it
B	yeah
A	and it'll just and it'll just take a while to like
B	mm
A	feel better
B	it might go purple
A	it might go green
A	it might go any colour
B	every colour
A	it was quite pinky purple last night so
B	it was and I was really surprised at the colour I didn't know if it
A	mm
B	that was just cos it was cold or
A	no it was a weird colour
B	but even before I went out it was a weird colour
A	mm
B	it was so cute
B	oh dear
A	yeah I was thinking that too like it wouldn't be that
B	like you always almost want to do it when you see people
A	mm I know I do definitely
B	I don't know what I like about it it's just
A	just nice you're just helping people out
B	and it's doesn't seem that complicated either if you know what you're doing
A	yeah like she was just kind of like
B	chill
A	doing what you'd do in that situation like just you know ask how much pain you're in sit you down make you comfortable
B	mm mm
A	all that stuff it's not like difficult things
B	and plus you'd have a team member with you so if you
A	yeah
B	didn't know what to do they would
A	exactly
B	they were really good the ambulance people
A	how do you become like an ambulance worker?
B	they're paramedics aren't they aren't they?
A	are they?
B	is I thought that's what
A	cos it's yeah but they weren't like surely they only sent out like the one on one people or something
B	mm
A	rather than like actual emergency people but yeah you might they might have just like
B	this is Lancaster
A	had a quiet
A	just come out anyway
B	I wonder what like is an emergency round here? cos I can't apart from
A	mm
B	I bet it's students all the time
A	yeah it'll be student based things I think in town and stuff
B	so it probably won't be very serious half the stuff like in Liverpool there is quite a lot of
A	mm
B	in terms of the hospitals like the
A	yeah
B	and obviously you get like I dunno people in hospital it's like it's not even mostly young people it's like there's a huge range like of every single age and then there's
A	mm
B	things like homeless people who will end up in there and stuff because of stuff
A	mm
B	but
A	yeah I don't like hospitals
B	I don't like hospitals
A	just when they're busy it's like no
B	I can't but that was probably about the emptiest hospital I've ever seen
A	I know I was so surprised
B	the emergency of I felt a bit silly going in on my chair when the
B	why is she in a wheelchair? she's hurt her arm why is
B	I was just directing me and I was tired so I was like why not?
B	why not?
A	you just sat in the wheelchair
B	and I was trying not to laugh
A	and then you were gonna get into the other one when he
A	when he offered it to you
A	yeah
B	I thought that was one and I'm like
A	you even had like a you had a shock blanket on as well
A	if they'd put like a foil blanket on you I would have lost it
B	your food?
A	mm
B	oh dear
A	oh this is nice isn't it? this
B	oh wow
A	might watch The Apprentice later hello?
B	what what?
A	I might watch The Apprentice later
B	oh yeah yeah have to watch the Apprentice at nine
A	mm
B	hello
C	hiya
B	oh
C	yeah
B	oh did you go to the?
A	oh
B	oh
C	yeah it doesn't close probably cos someone's got an enormous
B	oh I see what is the problem here we have Coke which I can empty cos it's mine
A	it's gone flat thought cos I
B	yeah it is pretty much flat to be honest
A	I kind of like flat Coke though
C	yeah
B	you like flat Coke?
A	yeah
C	why?
A	I don't know I just don't like it when it's fizzy really
C	really?
B	I love that's the appeal for me
C	yeah that's that's er that's why I get like
A	like it just has to be cold and I like it like
B	mm
A	if it's if it's like warmish like the like room temperature it's no
C	oh oh that's like Calpol disgusting
B	why is the?
A	it's flour on the er erm macaroni but I
B	didn't do this the other day okay
C	well it's because mine mine does that as well cos it's when they when they add to process it it has a lot of flour in it and you get flour coating around the outside but it doesn't taste of anything it's and it's not harmful
B	oh
C	I know like some brands of rice you have to actually rinse it beforehand
A	yeah
C	cos it has too much flour
B	yeah yeah
C	but not with pasta erm
B	oh you've got Coke Zero this time
C	I know I just wanted like you say I didn't wanna get Diet Coke again and it tastes it tastes
B	what is the difference between Coke Zero and Diet Coke?
C	marketing
A	yeah
B	yeah I I know yeah
C	yeah the word diet sounds too feminine it's the same with erm Diet Pepsi and Pepsi Max the other one so
B	like max manly
C	nothing more
A	but this is
C	fragile than a man's
A	but it's insulting to men though I think like I would be insulted I think if
B	yeah yeah
C	yeah it's a little bit kind of like how
A	yeah
C	like
A	that I would
B	by the way I texted
A	uhu
B	erm about the thing and I said I was I really enjoyed meeting you but I'm not sure about romantically stuff and he was like oh because you hadn't contact me I thought you weren't interested that's strange and then he said what's wrong with me romantically?
C	oh no
B	question mark it's
C	well that's that's not that's not erm
B	it's not really bad it's just like how do you?
C	awkward yeah
B	it's just
C	just say erm
B	nothing wrong with you
C	just say
B	but it's not even that it's not my type it's just that I didn't feel attracted to him in that way you know?
C	well he doesn't need to know that
B	but I think that's the best way to put it isn't it? just like
C	I just didn't feel like
B	I just didn't feel that attracted to you not in the way that you're not objectively
A	I'd just lie
B	cos he wasn't like unattractive that that isn't the problem it's just that I wasn't attracted to him in that
A	yeah that's what
C	yeah
A	he's
B	yeah
A	or I just didn't find
B	yeah
A	I dunno
B	I mean to be honest like half the guys like when you say to people like can we just be friends they're just not interested anymore
C	yeah
B	like
C	that's what happened with
B	yeah
A	I mean well kind of fair enough cos you did find him on Tinder so
B	yeah yeah
A	I mean he would be
B	Tinder Tinder so it's not like
C	but it's alright if you meet someone in person like
A	yeah no that's
B	are you not talking to
C	not really no
B	really?
A	I mean say you want to be friends
B	mm
C	but
A	yeah
B	yeah yeah
C	but I mean it's fair enough like you can't blame someone for
B	but like I
B	yeah
C	kind of thing
B	I feel like girls definitely have more interest in having guy mates than guys just having girl mates just
C	yeah
B	for the sake of it you know?
C	yeah that's true
B	cos every time I see a guy I don't immediately think boyfriend material whereas it seems with
C	I would tap that
B	yes
A	but
B	basically
B	well it's not no no not with every guy but I'd say more guys than girls would
A	no the only guy friend I have is gay so maybe it is
B	yeah
C	I bet it'll be out of date
A	I've been eating so many out of date things it's disgusting
B	it won't kill you
A	that's why I'm so ill
A	never I didn't yeah
B	cos I've had
B	to be honest I've had that experience before
C	mm
B	and it's not nice
C	it did taste weird yeah I
A	like just been made shitly by the
A	maybe just put more of this
C	did you stir it when you put it in?
A	er yeah once or twice but like
C	cos I find that if I don't stir it it sticks together
A	yeah
C	and then goes a bit weird
B	are you making macaroni?
A	not really it's just sort of like
B	it's kind of macaroni
B	oh god
A	oh I don't have any cheese left
B	I'm so tired
C	mm
B	winter just is er tiring
C	yeah you are just sort of constantly tired aren't you?
B	I just never feel fully energised in winter like
C	no
B	you know the days sometimes when you wake up like
B	you can put spinach in
C	I've got some salad that I bought today if you want
C	it's not spinach though it's just regular
A	well the one I had looked like cat sick so
B	oh okay
B	yeah yeah
C	mine's got green in it
B	yay
A	it looks really nice
B	gourmet yeah
C	mm
B	yeah oh what's this today or
C	Thursday is
B	are you staying this weekend then?
C	no
B	oh okay
C	Harry Potter night tonight
A	oh shit it is isn't it?
B	what the Harry Potter thingy?
A	yeah
B	what was that? was that like at a bar?
B	oh god
C	I don't feel like going in the end cos like I thought we were just going like going to a pub and playing like pub games and whatever but
B	it's clubbing?
C	and it's basically like a normal big night out but with Harry Potter scarves like I didn't seem
B	oh be good if it was Harry Potter music
C	mm
B	it is but it's not gonna be a Harry Potter themed
C	mm
A	mm
B	I can't remember what week it is this week
A	they're doing like
B	at the preview
A	erm like selling stuff on their own stalls
B	oh oh yeah you said pop up stalls
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	there are some really funny episodes like the one with the
A	and how it like
B	yes
A	just like it's
B	oh it was so funny
B	oh
C	didn't
B	yes
B	one of the girls
C	why?
B	I don't know she was called Stella and I don't know why I remember
A	mm
B	like it exploited
C	I mean it made you very unemployable afterwards
B	mm
C	she couldn't get any job
A	oh oh
C	okay?
B	yeah yeah
C	yeah that's true and I think erm the job itself was really shit like she didn't enjoy it it was very erm
B	no
C	or something like that and she just
B	I mean what do they actually do like if there is apprentice?
C	not the things they do on TV
B	no no exactly
C	and that's why it's so misleading like if you're a business person you are not directing a commercial and you're not acting in a commercial and you're not making music for a commercial and you're not doing a voiceover for a commercial
B	mm
C	you're not doing any of those things
B	no yeah that's true
C	you know you have like a creative team for that so you would like selling stuff for like erm
B	yeah
B	yeah
C	that's the only
B	real thing
C	yeah
B	the rest of it's just TV based
C	mm
B	see you later
A	no
A	I'm eating my tea
A	it's not annoying
B	oh
A	no I haven't either
B	no
A	why does this pasta taste so shit?
A	yeah I think it is
B	if it's squidgy
A	it's really squidgy I only had it in for like ten minutes but I think it's cos I didn't put salt in before I put
B	oh
A	the pasta in
B	I only learnt that tip like a few
A	yeah but I've always done it like without a thought but I didn't do it this time cos I think
B	mm
B	yeah yeah
A	and it tastes really bland the
B	had the most disgusting pasta
A	mm
B	it was like potato pasta like it
A	I've heard of that
B	it's really oh I mean some people really like it my sister likes it a lot I just
A	which one's tortellini?
B	like the it's like the parcels with and it's got stuff inside it like meat and stuff
A	oh do you mean
A	yeah
B	but it's not it's
A	yeah I don't like ravioli very much
B	no
A	that's just seriously bad pasta I'm really upset
B	what you've cooked it badly or the pasta itself?
A	I don't know it's
B	salt just drowns out everything
A	yeah I'm just gonna put like a ton of salt on it
A	just drown out the blandness
B	drown out the blandness
A	is that your phone?
B	no I think that's yours
A	oh god I don't wanna talk to anyone right now
B	oh my friend she's
A	did it only ring once?
B	it er yeah it nobody called back
A	I feel like a sad forty-year-old woman who lives on her own and has one of these
A	for watching like TV
B	you do look like a
A	yeah thanks
B	oh my god
A	this is so bad I can't get over it
B	are the chicken nuggets okay?
A	yeah but there are only three
A	mm
B	who who called you?
A	my mother
B	oh your mum
A	mm
B	yeah yeah
B	kind of like
A	she doesn't get it
B	persistent
A	and
B	yeah
A	and and it just yeah there's no point saying it to her and she end just she ends up just like having a go at me and saying like you're
B	like does she just like ring and then ask how your day is and then she
A	yeah
B	or is it just like she rings and gets angry straight away?
A	no it's yeah she starts off like you know
B	how are you doing kind of thing?
A	yeah
B	and then it goes
A	yeah
B	yeah that's a bit shit
A	yeah it does get annoying really
B	at least you're being pretty honest with her like imagine if you just turned round at the last minute and said oh actually I'm not going to my things I'm not enjoying it even though
A	oh god I no I'm glad that I just was honest from the outset
B	yeah exactly
A	because she would
B	cos it would be it's a lot less complicated
A	hit the roof yeah cos saying that I've missed like seven seminars in a row is just not that great is it
B	no
A	oh
B	after Isis called them idiots
B	wow
A	I hope it's true
B	I hope so
A	what?
B	the without killing people but instead like using a different tactic and like you know shutting down the basically their communications and things
A	mm yeah well I mean that's how they operate really
B	yeah like
A	social media
B	yeah definitely
A	which is quite scary
A	lovely
B	the pile of shame
A	what here?
B	yeah
A	why? you don't have time
B	I know
A	like I know you feel like you don't have much to do now but you will like next term
B	I know
A	oh but then again you could get like a part time thing like working in a shop somewhere here
B	yeah see there's a cos I doubt there'll be many jobs on campus seeing as
A	mm
B	there's so many students
A	no probably not
B	oh shit yeah
A	cos my diet is so bad today I've eaten
A	two choc ices
B	picture of health
A	and erm a glass of Coke
B	brilliant
A	and that's probably gonna be it for today
A	mm well it's Thursday tomorrow
B	it is
B	I am I really am
A	mm
B	actually
A	what time are you leaving on Friday?
B	probably later on in the day cos I've got lectures so I'd say about five
A	mm
B	so I'll I'll see before I go but
A	mm
B	what to go and see him?
A	yeah cos I can't really afford to
B	mm
A	give him any money like to well I mean I could give him a little bit but
B	yeah you can't really how much would it cost you to go and see him?
A	I mean he'd probably have to drive cos that's cheapest
B	oh okay
A	so it's just petrol money really
B	mm
A	which is probably about thirty quid or something like that
B	do you think it would make you feel better to go home for a bit or go somewhere? like
A	mm
B	it I know it's not home but
A	no I dunno I think so I just
B	yeah
A	everyone else gets to it's just
B	no no definitely
A	mm
A	for a whole three days and act interested and together
B	yeah yeah
A	is the sky blue?
B	cos it's Christmas?
A	no hundred percent all interrogation
B	mm
A	you know
B	yeah
A	even if I was having a good time she would still interrogate me
B	still ask you about yeah
A	yeah it's gonna be like why didn't you ring us more? why have you been like crying on the phone and just not telling us what's going on? and why have you been missing everything and why have you gotten yourself into this mess? and blah blah blah blah di blah
B	does she know the extent of it now?
A	mm not really
B	or not particularly
A	well I I dunno like it's difficult to just say oh yeah I haven't been going to this and this and
B	yeah yeah
A	because I'm feel like
B	definitely
A	completely too depressed to get out of bed sometimes or I'm too scared to go or I just don't really give a shit
B	yeah yeah
A	she's not really that kind of person
B	you can't really yeah
A	she's not like
B	is she not really that
B	the emotional type?
A	no no
B	no
A	well I mean she can be but just not about this sort of thing cos she's she's just she used to tell me to snap out of it
B	mm
A	and she's just that's that sort of person
B	does she not see it as
A	really
B	like an emotional issue? she just sees it as like a
A	well
B	yeah
A	really got kind of
B	yeah
A	realised that when I was like really hysterical over the summer and shit
B	okay
A	erm
B	yeah
A	but she still you know you can still sense the scepticism in her voice like
B	no it is shit when family just don't understand cos that's the thing cos she's not here so she can't see either
A	mm
B	so she can't
A	mm
B	but
A	if I carry on and go and do the plan of like going home at Christmas on the
B	yeah yeah
A	either way like if I was gonna leave I'd have to come
B	uhu
A	back and get my stuff and
B	like I dunno I don't know why cos I remember when I went home when I dropped out I was like telling my parents I'm gonna get a job I'm gonna do this and I didn't and I don't know why I didn't I just like probably I wouldn't be in have got in such a mess if I had done that but I just thought it would be easier not to
A	yeah
B	like a break turned into I
A	mm
B	it is it's so easy
A	do that cos but erm
B	that's the thing like it's so
A	yeah
B	difficult to deal with but it's so easy to get into that
A	mm
B	habit
A	like people sometimes ask me like how did you spend the whole year just doing nothing? like
B	it's just
A	when you say you did nothing
B	easy
A	for year and it's literally
B	it's so easy
A	it's literally true I didn't do a thing like all I did was sit on my phone or I just had like the radio on and I just had a cup of tea and I'd just sit on my bed and those were the only two things I would do like
B	mm
A	and it was just nothing else like yeah I mean obviously sometimes I would go out and see my friends but very rarely
B	mm
A	and I'd like always had like a really strong kind of anxiety about getting a job even from when I was like
B	yeah same
A	fifteen and sixteen or
B	I mean some people are really desperate to get a job when they leave school like a lot of my friends
A	yeah
B	just just get them
A	yeah
B	and they used to be really happy about it and I think like I
A	mm
B	so scary
A	what were you doing?
B	frozen
A	oh
B	so yeah
A	yeah that's the thing you realise that it's absolutely brutal it's like this horrible
B	it's so hard
A	paradox of if you have no experience they're not interested because you need
B	but you need experience
A	experience to get experience
B	yeah
A	and it's just like there's no way to break into that without one or the other like
B	like
A	for not having
B	even things that are meant to be the starter job things like waitresses
A	I know
B	require experience
A	yeah and the way they are in the interviews these days like they ask a lot they really do
B	mm
A	I went I remember I went to an interview
B	what did they ask you?
A	they just like questioned me constantly and they put me on the spot and they asked me to go out into the shop and ask people what that I I had to go like sell them something and it was just like fucking hell like this is not
B	that sounds horrendous
A	I just want I just need a fucking job I was desperate by this point and I I ran out in tears cos I was just so overwhelmed by it cos like how horrible they were like
B	mm
A	just insistent and like you have to say this and oh it was just horrible
B	mm
A	and I couldn't even get one when I was nineteen like just doing a basic job that where all we have to do is like stack shelves and that's it really
B	I know
A	it's just horrible
B	it's funny how they say that like you know for Boots and all that
A	don't want it exactly
B	why why does it why do they still consider that like a?
A	like all I was doing like he told me to go out into the shop and pretend I was like working so I went out and like stacked some shelves and shit people came up to me like asking me questions like where's this where's that? and I had like this old lady and feel like I I did it well enough like I just said to her what are you looking for? like and I and I showed her where it was and then it was fine and I just smiled at her I didn't like insist that she bought anything and I felt like that's what that's what you'd want in in customer service rather than when
B	be like
A	he told me told me to go off and
B	yeah
A	actually try and sell something to this like poor woman with a kid on her arm like who just didn't
B	obviously wasn't in the position
A	have the time of day
B	yeah
A	yeah and it was just ridiculous and I had to do it cos he was like no you have to do it
B	I mean places like fast food restaurants scare me
A	yeah
B	because they're so vast
A	vast I know
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B is not afraid of food places.	Contradiction
A	I just feel incapable of it like and
B	mm
A	doing it that quickly like
B	yeah I do
A	even when I did KP work for my friend's restaurant like I only did that for a couple of weeks because it was too stressful like the speed of it all and
B	mm
A	like it was so unorganised and
B	yeah
A	I just I felt like I had to do it really quickly but I didn't I couldn't do it as
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A was very fast when worked at the restaurant.	Contradiction
B	mm
A	quickly as the plates were coming and it was just like so scary
B	oh my god
A	and it's just really stupid things like that like a tiny little job like that is just so overwhelming to me and
[ANNOTATION]	Once, 15 plates came straightforward.	Neutral
B	no no
A	and that's why I didn't get a job
B	honestly I feel the same
A	for the whole year like it was just ridiculous
B	like the thought of work is scary
A	yeah it's really scary and that's why I don't wanna leave because I I'm just scared like this is the next thing for me like if I leave here then I have to get a job and that's gonna be my life like it's not like I get a way out of that
B	it's weird to think that's a yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A does not want to give up his/her current job.	Entailment
A	you know? it's not like I'd go back to uni cos I won't I I've I won't have a chance to when I leave here
B	it's a
A	it's petrifying
B	yeah
A	it's really petrifying cos it's just not what you want is it?
B	it's a sad way to live
B	and like work your way up kind of thing
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A has been in this job for 3 years.	Neutral
A	yeah
B	I guess university is more of a springboard
A	absolutely
B	towards it
A	that's how I see it it's just a means to an end
B	mm
A	and it's just you know it's just really scary
B	mm
A	one year and then I can't just live at home all my life I have to go out and do shit myself and that's just it's really scary cos I just don't feel like I can
B	alternatively how about
A	no I don't think I could
B	no?
A	it's too demanding
B	no
A	no but I am
B	no no but
A	that's what everyone says to me
B	it's not that you're making excuses because say you know you're trying to avoid it
A	it is

A	very well
A	she was nice but I was awful so
B	I remember you on your first day
B	I did but I didn't
A	oh
B	or upset no you weren't crying you just looked distraught
A	oh good
A	mm
B	and you looked scared and I didn't know
B	you were in my yeah
B	I was pretty I
A	yeah
B	and it was a dream
A	I think I was so nervous because I was far from home
B	yeah cos you'd had a big build up
A	and like we'd just
B	to it
A	yeah
B	like literally it was like
A	and I said
B	an hour for me
A	I don't wanna do it like
B	I bet that was a whole like a horrible car journey
A	oh my god
B	the whole thing
A	it was awful yeah
B	ah
A	but the night before when we got to
B	broke down
A	that's when I freaked out yeah and then the next day I like almost didn't leave the hotel room and we had to like
B	oh no
A	and to be honest there was some part of me wishes I'd just gone home then cos I just wouldn't have wasted so much money
B	would your parents have let you?
A	yeah we were gonna like it was it was a case of like my mum deciding one way or the other and like cos I said to her like I can't make the decision and then I think it was my auntie who just said let's just go there and I was like right fine cos I'm not doing this I'm not you know dictating what happens next so
B	uhu
A	it's not
B	oh my god
A	I know
B	I can imagine
A	yeah
B	we can make
A	basically
B	this will change your life
A	oh
B	kind of
A	I know
B	you're in the north officially that must be weird still
A	it's so far
A	somebody is actually from
B	dislocated
A	someone else is was stupid enough to like
B	come up here
A	come all this way
B	and there's southerners as well like Londoners
A	yeah
B	Devoners Somerseters who I've met which it's nearer to you than me
A	yeah
B	mm
A	to be able to just drive home in an hour or so like
B	yeah
A	and just
B	yeah
A	it would be so much easier
B	it's quite funny thinking
A	I know
B	yeah
A	and your sister
B	yeah pretty much
A	absence
B	not arguing
A	makes the heart grow fonder
B	yeah we're not like
A	yeah
B	on bad terms so
A	yeah if it wasn't for all this shit I think we'd me and my mum would get on better like when I went home for Christmas
B	mm
A	like cos my sister did after her first
B	oh that's good
A	year
B	does she usually
B	get on with your mum?
A	yeah they get along really well now
B	really?
A	with my mum before like she went to uni
B	it is
A	I hope
B	oh my god like
A	though me and her are a little bit worse than in erm her and
B	mm
A	I'm sure
B	maybe cos you're unhappier than
A	yeah
B	depending
A	I know also because we used to be really close and that's just that makes it harder
B	okay yeah
A	erm
B	at Christmas?
A	no not really I just I'm scared of what she's gonna say to me
B	she'll be happy to see you
A	I mean I no I mean I'm
B	to be questioned
A	to be questioned by her cos
B	yeah
A	it was really quite
B	mm
A	intense over the summer like
B	you're doubting it a bit
A	yeah
B	I think people will just be
A	mm
B	like less focus on you more focus on an occasion kind of thing and I think to be honest I know this I don't know what your family are like but I think they honestly will be just glad to have you back
B	look at all these plates in your room you disgust me you're a disgrace to yourself and to Cornwall
B	yeah
A	mm
B	and look at think of the good things about Christmas like Christmas trees and all the lights in your er do your town have lights?
A	yeah
B	I'm sure they will
B	you felt bad?
A	yeah
B	why?
A	I dunno I just I
B	I know what you mean when people say they've got me presents
A	yeah
B	I always feel guilty immediately
A	I just don't deserve for her to spend money on me like that I really don't like it's not and I don't know what to get her either like I'm just so bad at present giving I just
B	I'd be excellent at present giving if I had money
A	yeah I think you would
B	I'm gonna make when I have money at Christmas because I'm in er I'm gonna try and save a bit of money up for Christmas so I can get everybody stuff because this
A	yeah
B	er literally like at the moment oh I can't even like well I can buy myself stuff but that's minimum I can't buy books half the time because of stuff
A	yeah
B	and it's just like
A	mm
B	kind of thing I'm like oh
A	it's just advertising you shouldn't listen to it
B	I know god like
A	wouldn't your parents pay for your books?
B	to be honest they
A	probably would if you asked
B	yeah they would to be honest like
A	cos it's like when you were in school and you needed a new pair of shoes and they'd pay for it
B	yeah yeah
A	cos it's like you know to do with your education
B	mm
B	but I don't know
A	yeah
B	it's just that I'm just that is
B	looming in my mind
A	yeah
B	and it's like I'm asking them for money on top of potentially what they have to pay
A	yeah I get that
B	you know and it's like they already might have to pay one thousand three hundred pounds and it's like
A	it won't come to that
B	I hope not please grant my appeal student finance
B	please give me money
A	if they don't there's still a chance to
B	appeal further
A	yeah
B	you can take it to step two I think
A	yeah exactly and you should
B	but I don't know if that'll get out of my situation like I thought
B	I thought I I thought I made it pretty clear like in the
A	it did it it was clear in the letter the thing that you wrote
B	mm
A	it was really clear
B	yeah cos it wasn't just the fact that I dropped out early it was because the contract was absolutely silly I couldn't refund I couldn't get money back from it
A	mm
B	and I dropped out eight days before the end of the year so
A	yeah it really is
B	it was for maintenance but because my
A	yeah
B	course was so short it was April I think they gave me enough finance to last till June because my accommodation lasted till June
A	oh yeah I see
B	but I couldn't get my accommodation refund because accommodation is non-refundable when you're a student in
A	yeah
B	so I yep so I couldn't just give them my money back
A	yeah accommodation's never refundable
B	so why?
A	anywhere
B	oh
A	it's awful
B	dicks
A	like I'm so lucky at at
B	yeah yeah
A	cos if I hadn't I don't know what I would have done I really don't I would have had to pay it the whole year
B	oh god
A	that was the condition at
B	wow
A	but she took up the rent obviously which is oh a godsend
B	what if you left in like the first week? would you still have to?
A	erm I don't know I'm not sure
B	no
A	yeah cos it it I I'd just missed some sort of cut-off point where you could like you know not have to pay for everything
B	how long did it take you to find somebody?
A	er about three days
B	oh wow
A	I just like luckily I knew her through one of my flatmates like she was it was
B	mm
A	but it was lucky that I tracked her down and was like hey have my room and
B	that is lucky
A	it is
B	that's really lucky
A	yeah
A	don't
