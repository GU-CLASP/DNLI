A	you don't know if it's
B	yes help yourself
A	er
B	yes I
A	that fruit actually lasted pretty well but I just had to throw away one peach I think yeah or one or might might have been one nectarine that had gone
B	mm
A	horribly mouldy and one pear I think that had gone funny
B	oh this is quite sour
A	mm
B	mm
A	mm and then you know I was thinking
B	about
A	well
B	yes well no
A	well
B	which
B	oh you mean the
A	yes
B	well we've we we've done that a few times haven't we?
A	well there's the gardens in

A	that's even more depressing
B	couldn't
A	mm?
B	Sunday
A	mm
B	couldn't do a Sunday?
A	yeah well it would have to be somewhere
B	I think so
A	mm did we go there once?
B	I don't I don't think so I don't think I don't think I've ever been to
B	oh now that's somewhere I'd like to go
A	mm
B	I don't know
A	well that's somewhere near there as well I think
B	which would be the seventeenth
A	or in your case er next Sunday
B	I'm not gonna be here this Sunday
A	why not?
B	I'm going up to
A	how can you do that when you've just been away for a week holiday?
B	er well I I'm going up on Thursday
A	mm oh
B	I'm taking three days off
A	you keep saying you don't have leave
B	well I'm using this this is a bit of a combination of flexi and leave
A	mm
B	I'm going up to erm a a friend of
A	by train?
B	so Sunday the seventeenth will be fine
A	I don't know how you can take all by train?
B	what? train
A	to
B	yes I'm taking the train yes
A	how much is that?
B	erm advanced ticket so I can't remember it's not not a lot
A	sixty quid I bet
B	yeah about that
A	and what about the hotel and stuff?
B	er no hotel it's just staying at friends
A	that's August bank holiday weekend isn't it?
B	no that's the er twenty-fifth twenty-sixth
B	erm
A	oh that's gonna be a nightmare
B	and you're going away around about the same time
A	I'm coming back or going away
B	oh
A	and I think there isn't much
B	what are those postcards?
A	they're the ones from Skye
B	oh are they?
A	they got wet in Skye but they seem to have dried out but that's
B	mm I don't remember too er Portree looking like looking like that do you?
A	where's Portree?
B	that was that erm
A	oh yes it was
B	we stayed at
A	it's because we didn't go to the water much because it was raining all the time
B	yeah it was quite misty as well
A	ah I didn't see
B	mm
A	yeah we did walk we walked down to that one that's painted white cos I think it's been repainted pink now
B	well there was a all I remember at Portree down by the harbour was that row of terraced houses
A	yeah
B	all painted in bright colours
A	yeah well that they weren't all you're
B	could be
A	like that like those ones that we got from like
B	mm
A	I wouldn't have sent those if I'd realised
B	mm
A	maybe it's a boathouse
B	I don't know I can't quite place it
A	yeah cos we didn't walk that oh I know that white place is
B	yes erm well we went past on the boat they looked very dramatic didn't they?
A	yeah it looked they looked better from er from those other islands was it mm
B	erm
A	yeah but we didn't go there we went to the other one
B	no we went we sailed past them
A	yes and we went
B	and then
A	but as we were
B	the right hand side
A	yes exactly and and so you could see the mountains but then
B	mm
A	when you actually got to
B	no
A	there was a play on the radio actually set on erm Raasay I think it's called
B	mm
A	that that long thin island
B	Raasay yes yes
A	about somebody who'd built a road
B	yes
A	on what do you know about that?
B	yes erm
A	I don't know about all the way around it was
B	where from?
A	I don't know from where they lived I suppose
B	I don't think there's much on it anyway
A	no it's probably like that one
B	mm
A	that was a bit of a waste of time
B	oh yes yes
A	I wonder if they will
B	who would?
A	Scots
B	well
A	I looked at the map and it is much smaller than Norway but maybe the population is roughly the same size
B	mm I think it is about the same isn't it? it's about
A	which
B	is it four million or something?
A	well probably
B	very small
B	I can't see them voting yes
A	why not?
B	well I can't really see any any
A	well I can't see any strong argument for not voting yes quite honestly apart from negative ones
B	no you spoke to him though
A	I thought his er reasoning was very childlike childish too actually
B	mm
A	did you erm did you feel
B	oh erm er that chap from St Andrews
A	yes
B	no because I I wasn't erm party to that conversation was I?
A	yeah but were you happy that were you still happy when we saw him again in Portree that we hadn't accepted the lift or did you feel guilt?
B	no I didn't feel any guilt no I well I mean why should why should I feel guilty I mean yes he he he offered to give us a lift erm but we have every right to say yes or no
B	and and and
A	I keep remembering a bloke in Munich
B	mm
A	and I think that's looking back I think that's highly suspicious
B	yeah I think when you're by yourself you've got to be more wary
A	exactly but he seemed all very very pleasant at the time I happened to say I was going Vienna next erm
B	mm
A	it was quite tempting cos I think I don't know how I knew but I think he seemed to have quite a nice car
B	mm
A	yeah it was
B	mm and and the other thing is when when you're travelling in in someone's car you feel obliged to make conversation all the time which can be quite tiring and
A	well he
B	no
A	I mean it's a funny thing to do as well to go
B	yes he was he was just kind of
A	drifting
B	drifting yeah taking it as it comes like
A	but what do you think about that other bloke that artist that furniture person
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about party	Contradiction
B	mm
A	the
B	background but why
A	the
B	he he was doing something that he'd done several times before
A	plus he'd hired a cottage or he'd
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about cottage	Entailment
B	oh I can't remember that
A	outside Mallaig he had a car he had a car as well I think
B	no you didn't
A	ah a cursory acknowledgement and erm that was a but
B	mm
A	cos you it's odds on it's quite likely you'd say the wrong thing
B	so did you did you so you you emailed him?
A	yeah I told him
B	mm
A	he needs some I think I probably said what what I
B	mm
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about a car	Entailment
A	I probably said all the same things that I said on the boat that
B	mm
A	he did
B	yes
A	oh I don't know probably when we got back
B	oh
A	the nineteenth of June
[ANNOTATION]	person A is talking about one date	Entailment
B	well maybe he's changed it
B	mm
A	you can go you can check if you want
B	well if if you can give give me the website and I can have a look
A	are you really interested?
B	no well
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about party	Contradiction
A	you wouldn't know it if
B	but but I wouldn't know what's erm what it looked like before
A	no
B	yes
A	anyway I
B	mm
A	I think
B	oh
B	yeah yeah that's about the only
B	Elgar I know well apart from the really popular
A	well I think you'd recognise
B	Pomp and Circumstance
A	well I think you'd
B	what Dream of Gerontius?
A	er?
B	which one?
A	Pomp and Circumstance
B	oh
A	he thought it was for a wedding he thought it was very inappropriate
B	mm
A	do you think he meant the Land of Hope and Glory bit? do you is that what he means do you think?
B	I don't know there are several of them aren't there?
A	well I don't know
B	so it depends
A	I think that colours your thing cos he dismissed the second symphony and I said it's actually quite poignant because it's a sort of farewell to empire
B	mm
A	you well you'd you
B	mm I think
A	it's a hardly it's hardly a triumphant ending quite the opposite
B	mm
A	everything is on Youtube I don't see how they can be on Youtube actually must be illegal on phones
B	yes well all that copyright business seems to have just gone by the wayside
A	well I'm sure that I'm sure if people wanted to they could they could get in touch with Youtube and get these things taken off couldn't they?
B	mm I don't know
A	I'm I'm sure you I'm sure you can
B	mm
A	no well it it would be whoever is the copyright holder if it's a piece of art
B	mm
A	but that that could include the copyright holder I mean supposing Elgar's got family do they
B	mm
A	I think it's different in
B	acquired by the publisher isn't it?
A	what you mean normally?
B	and and it's
A	are you sure it's acquired by the publisher? because I thought it was the author
B	I always thought it was the
A	copyright Stephen Pinker so it's
B	oh
A	so it's the author and it says
B	mm
A	but then I'm sure things pass to your heirs
B	mm I don't know no idea
A	and also it's different in the USA I think actually it's shorter
B	oh is it?
A	I think so
B	mm
B	yes
A	did you see about those seagulls in Rome by the way attacking er when the pope?
B	no
A	you must have read it it's on the BBC there's a thing on the BBC page
B	oh that'll be on Youtube
A	well it might be but they they released two doves and a seagull attacked one of the doves and what I didn't realise was they eat them
B	oh gosh
A	so they're beyond the pale as far as I'm concerned now they hit the the seagull got the dove but by er tail feathers and so the dove escaped minus a few feathers
B	oh gosh
A	imagine the symbolism of that I mean how and it's very embarrassing as well imagine you're the pope
B	mm you'd think they'd have people to take care of that sort of thing and make sure there are no birds around
A	how can they?
B	well
A	but yeah apparently that's
B	scare them off or something
A	that's a point of this report by a journalist BBC journalist whatever or a correspondent that it Rome has been overrun with these wretched what are they called? mackerel gulls? herring gulls
B	herring gulls yes yes
A	which are which are what these are
B	these are yes
A	they're horrid vicious things and you can tell about the way they're screaming and they're
B	mm
A	and anyway so I've got no
B	well
A	not much though cos the on campus there's a there's a rookery and
B	really?
A	they've both flying there
B	mm yes well they I'd I
A	has it gone?
B	yes
A	why?
B	I don't know they probably just moved on and I think it's since they've gone that we've got the seagulls
A	but it isn't yeah but the it isn't just in the close that they're nesting they're nesting
B	yeah they're probably nesting in the vicinity or they were
A	well it's a very large vicinity because on parallel streets they they are around and I doubt whether our little tiny rookery was influencing a couple of roads away or a couple of streets away er have you
B	mm
A	you have? those flat bits
B	yes yes well I mean lots of people they end up putting barbed wire or mesh up don't they to to keep them off their chimney stacks and
A	I don't cos er cos when I run past that house by the path into the park at the sort of bottom of
B	yeah
A	oh it one it it's it's near the path into the park
B	right
A	er it
B	it right next to the path
A	it's before the turn in the road goes
B	oh right
A	haven't you noticed them?
B	no no
A	anyway
B	mm
A	but it isn't just me cos I've had
B	mm oh they will do yes
A	well that's certainly
B	a lot
A	I've that's what's happening on the campus I'm sure that they are
B	I think they have to do it more humanely that that
A	well
B	mm
A	and they were the flight of steps were cordoned off but eventually the nest
B	mm
A	what other what other apart from foxes? well it could be any wildlife in that area
B	mm I dunno
A	they all maybe they all go for eggs
B	yeah
A	but it's er something's got to be done because as one of my colleagues said
B	mm
A	well
B	well it's it's the human
A	messing
B	I think it's a human
A	yeah because
B	that we caused it
A	yeah probably by taking too much fish out of too many fish out of the sea so they've got nothing to live on where they should be living on them and so they've moved
B	yeah and and we we leave too much too much food out rubbish and they scavenge
A	but that doesn't give them an excuse to start pecking and killing other birds
B	well that's just their nature
A	reptilian
B	mm
B	mm
