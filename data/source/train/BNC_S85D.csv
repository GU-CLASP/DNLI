C	yeah you both have to have
B	sign it together? mm
D	it's not because I don't trust him it's just funny it was literally just
C	mine was literally for the race but then we just kept it
C	but also as well like the other day I had er
D	I don't
A	I had like sixteen notifications and I hadn't looked on it at all
D	yeah
C	so like it's not like
D	I don't go on it I just get that but I don't check er if if I haven't had that I don't go oh where is he?
C	no
B	who
D	me
D	and then
C	no

D	did you start reading that book?
C	no
D	I knew you wouldn't
A	what book?
D	Before I Go To Sleep
A	I feel like I've heard it
D	it's a film with Nicole Kidman and Colin
A	mm
D	but it was a book first really good
B	it's not that one with the
A	oh no
C	no
B	mm
A	I still don't even know what that is
C	that's The Others isn't it?
B	well it was weird whatever it was I didn't like it
C	with the girl under the the lantern and the
B	yeah
C	mm
B	yeah weird
C	erm
D	yeah I've seen the adverts
B	mm
C	it
A	I don't really do like horror movies
C	neither do I I don't like it but er what happens basically is erm
B	I don't really get horrors because
C	right what happens basically is every
B	they're so fake
C	yeah
D	I haven't tried this is this nice?
C	mm
B	thriller?
C	I won't do any sort of erm possession
B	no okay yeah yeah yeah
D	that doesn't bother me
C	I struggle really much with possession because I'm not quite sure what I think about it and like
B	okay
C	so I don't really like watching that so I remember when I watched The Exorcist
C	right? so
C	so I'm like I'm older now I can handle this no I ended up sleeping in in my mum's bed for a week
C	right? and
D	what were you scared of?
C	walking to my back against the door
D	I walk with my back against the wall anyway
C	I don't wanna be in my own bed right? so anyway then
B	think it's slightly more awkward if you get possessed next to your mum
C	yeah
B	hi
C	well is it
B	slightly possessed here
C	it is if erm it is if like she says what she says in The Exorcist and then she goes your mother sucks cocks in hell no that is not for me and do you know what's not for me? when they start speaking in tongues
A	yeah
D	what is that? cheese?
A	yeah I think so
C	that's freaky and they start speaking in tongues and they start like going and like all the all the what is what was the old? Aramaic is it Aramaic?
A	yeah
C	the old language of the Bible?
A	no idea
C	that freaks me out firstly number one
B	well
C	I don't know why it freaks me out because nobody has heard Aramaic
C	so I don't even know how they're doing that
C	and number two like I am
B	oh
A	mm
C	about a priest who doesn't really believe in god anymore so their monastery sends him to erm to erm
B	hell
C	Italy
A	okay
C	to meet someone who performs exorcism and he goes very sceptical about it cos he doesn't wanna be a priest anymore and he sees some real fucked up shit and real exorcism Anthony Hopkins is the guy there that does the exorcisms erm basically the whole story is about how it's quite weird and all of this stuff and a lot of demonic possession and things and it's quite freaky as it is so you're worried aren't you?
B	does it flash?
D	mm
C	mm disco in her pocket
B	that's an Iphone 5?
C	really pisses me off
B	is it? is it?
D	five C any Iphone can flash though
B	what? like when you?
D	it's just your settings
B	well I might have to crash some of that
D	and when it rings it flashes like
C	it's the most annoying thing when you're watching TV and like
C	what the fuck is that? a lighthouse?
C	erm
B	he's mm
C	and it's the worst shit I've ever seen in my life it's awful
C	and erm I was at home
A	you were watching it on your own?
C	I watched it on my own
A	why?
C	I don't know
C	so ever since then I've vowed never to watch scary movies but every three months this little shit convinces me it's a good idea
A	yeah but we we all know she's a bit twisted anyway
C	oh yeah she'll kill she'll kill a man one day
A	yeah
D	not
C	made me watched The Conjuring the other day
D	what happened in that?
C	the woman go possessed and was in the roof loft going
D	I can't even remember it
C	do you not remember The Conjuring? we were sitting there watching it and we're like
D	was it the mum one?
C	the mum she got possessed
D	yeah
C	and she was like trying to
D	yeah but I don't watch it cos it's an exorcism I just like those kind of like I also actually prefer like Texas Chainsaw Massacre and The Hills Have Eyes they're better films
A	the gory stuff?
D	yeah
C	which aren't really horrors they're just
D	no but they could happen
C	you believe in god
A	but that's the er
C	how can you say it doesn't happen?
D	cos people don't get possessed like that that's bullshit
C	you don't think where there's a heaven there's a hell? you don't think there's demons?
D	no there's no hell well there's demons but not in that way
C	you're ridiculous
D	but I don't believe it so it doesn't scare me whereas there are actual psychos that would like come and cut you up and
C	yeah there's a lot of like
D	yeah
C	retarded hillbillies
D	so they scare me more
C	who live up in the mountains and kill people
A	yeah and there's a lot of people that when they're in a group think right let's split up because apparently that always ends well
B	you go that way
A	you go that way and I'll go this way
B	I'll go this way alone
A	and we'll both know that we're not gonna both see each other ever again
D	what did we watch when she went down the hole? did I watch that with you?
C	er I dunno
A	The Call?
D	yeah
C	mm
A	and at the end she goes er you'll er she's staring down
D	and you're like don't do it
A	she drops her phone doesn't she?
D	yeah
A	like you're clearly not gonna go down there right oh no no she's gonna go down
D	oh mate don't she the then I was going why are you fucking going down there?
D	you wouldn't do that
C	I'm like for god's sake woman
C	you've dropped your phone you're like right I've got no mode of
C	do you know what mean? er do you wanna go there? you're police do you know what I mean? you don't go I'll tell you what I'll do erm I'll
C	who has killed like three people cos that's a really good idea I don't care if you're Halle Berry do you know what I mean? like
A	I don't know why she was particularly fond of
C	I don't know why she cut her hair like that either
A	I don't know why she was on the phone over the
A	hole as well like
C	mm
A	that's er that's
C	do you know what I mean?
A	a rookie mistake
B	she should
C	when I think there's somewhere that I could drop my phone in
A	yeah
C	I hold it tighter
A	yeah
C	do you know what mean? that is just
A	near a toilet for example
C	yeah
C	I'll go and put it down
A	I er I I actually really enjoyed that movie didn't
D	yeah we did
A	like the
B	up until that point
A	I didn't like the ending yeah
C	no we did say that we didn't er didn't expect that to happen
D	what happened at the end?
A	like
C	they chained him up and then left him
A	they chained him up
B	they they
A	and left him
D	oh yeah
A	and then they were gonna say that she escaped or some bollocks
C	yeah it was like what you gonna
B	she she ran through the woods
C	so you're just gonna let him starve? like or you're gonna let him find something in the room full of sharp objects to untie himself with
A	exactly
C	and then get out and do it again
D	or just stab him
A	yeah
D	kill him
A	and then report it
C	yeah
A	let him bleed out
D	torture him
B	it was like Prisoners wasn't it?
A	yeah I enjoyed that as well but there was
C	what?
A	Prisoners it's like
C	oh yeah I
A	with Jake Gyllenhaal but there was
A	one moment in it that really wound me up
C	yeah
A	and it's the moment where
C	Hugh Jackman's in it ain't he?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	he's one of the guards
A	and Jake Gyllenhaal's like
C	I watched it with
A	he's sat he's sat
C	and my mum
A	well
C	actually turned around at the end of the film and said honest to god
D	I wanna hear what
C	go on
B	yeah
A	well no there's just there's a scene in it where basically it's that like standard point where he's like er he doesn't know what to do he's like tried all different kind of solutions he's chased every like clue and it's led nowhere and he's like getting shit from his boss and he sits down at his desk and manages to knock off like a load of photos and evidence and stuff
D	and something is revealed to him
A	and then like as he looks down he just happens to see the one piece of evidence that he needs
D	mm this always happens
A	and you're like oh that's just such a shit scene like he could've he could've like just remembered
D	yeah
A	that photo and then gone searching for it that would've been like less
D	but that always happens in films where something just gets revealed
A	yeah
D	by accident and it's like
A	oh
D	that's the thing they need for the movie
A	yeah
D	to carry on
C	right in real life
C	do you know what I mean? they don't what I do is I pull everything out of the fucking bedroom and everything
D	can I can we just
A	yeah
D	go back to
A	oh she didn't know what Ebola was
D	Ebola
C	yeah she didn't know what Ebola was yeah
B	wow
D	bearing in mind this was only like it had been on the news a lot before this this wasn't right at the beginning

A	yeah
D	actors
A	she's just oh she's just cringe isn't she really?
B	yeah
D	I saw that when I the only bit I watched was Daniel Radcliffe with
C	it's a classic example of why kids shouldn't be stars
A	yeah
D	mm
A	but like even I feel I feel a little bit bad for her like obviously she doesn't have
D	yeah but it doesn't happen to all of them like
C	a lot of a lot of
D	Hermione

D	I don't know much about it
A	if it gets if it gets much worse I can see I can see the US and the UK starting to consider things like completely cutting off
D	they should
B	is no one slightly worried at the fact that if you are in a West African country you can go anywhere in the world and you don't have to be screened? you you don't have to be

A	it's really dangerous
B	in New Jersey that's was in solitary confinement?
A	mm

[ANNOTATION]	the nurse had travelled to Senegal	Neutral
B	mm

B	but she then started to take legal action because she was
C	to go on a bike ride
B	fuck yeah fuck off get back in there
D	a bike ride?
[ANNOTATION]	the law says they can't force you to stay in confinement	Neutral
C	yeah

D	they should be confined
B	you could get on a coach or a plane travel for twelve hours be in three countries across and no one's
D	why have they not stopped people from travelling?
B	yeah
D	that's just er common sense isn't it?
B	yeah yeah yeah
C	because er they are a real fucking fucked up country aren't they? they're really corrupt
B	yeah

D	the bodies I've just seen the bodies like in the streets like
C	when they have when they yeah when they have a report of someone with Ebola
C	there's nothing there's no reason they're gonna let them die cos they're gonna die
A	they're not disposing of bodies properly
C	but the bodies when er
B	mm mm mm
C	passing it on when they're dead
A	mm
C	so they're not burying them properly
D	I don't know why they're not doing anything about it really like they're treating people but
C	they need to ban
D	they need to
A	they are they're doing
D	stop it
A	like I was kind of saying to
C	yeah
A	crazy
B	have you ever watched Walking Dead?
C	yeah
D	no
B	okay so we've just finished the first season
C	yeah
B	and when it explains what kind of happens in the hospital and you can see the army just shooting people
C	yeah
B	that's probably gonna happen
A	mm
B	you can just can't you just imagine that?
C	yeah
B	like that whole fuck it we'll just go in there and kill them all
D	they should have like quarantine stations
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	scary
C	I think erm I think cos what is there? there's this is the largest pandemic of Ebola ever isn't it?
B	yeah yeah
C	so isn't there like something like twelve
B	there's
C	thousand
B	yeah
C	or something?
A	that's
B	I read er like
A	crazy
B	the last week it was
D	I don't know
B	ten thousand so
A	mm
C	yeah
B	probably more
C	yeah and like I just think to myself like
B	mm
D	but there was that guy in Wales that thought he had it and I don't know what happened with that
C	yeah I don't think he had it
B	he had a cold didn't he?
C	yeah
D	did he?
A	yeah
C	and somebody went and thought he did in London and
C	like and a West African man thought he did in London but he didn't have it
A	but ironically it's mainly doctors and nurses that
D	yeah
A	are bringing it back because obviously they're going out there to help
D	like that guy he went back
A	mm the doctor
D	cos he
A	yeah
C	I know
D	he's going back I'm like what?
C	he's gone do you know what I mean? like
B	how much
C	do you know what I mean? like
D	treat people
C	you can help people and I get that and it's really great
A	no
C	because there's no reason for you to come back
A	that's what's more dangerous having them flit in and out it's like
B	oh you're you're ill
A	did you hear me
C	it's like the army as well the army going out and
A	did you hear me massively put my foot in it with
C	no
A	like we were talking

A	and he
B	really?
A	yeah well I said oh at least he's not a medic and
D	can you fuck off I'm not coming round your house
D	what if he's got Ebola?
C	he hasn't got Ebola
D	how do you know? how long has he been back?
B	yeah how do you know? seriously
B	you don't know
C	he's been back a while
C	I don't think he's brought Ebola to Peterborough
B	oh why are you round here?
B	go away
D	I'm not going out with the guy
C	he went he
D	I haven't touched him
C	to be fair he went
D	but when
B	you what?

C	I know it's awkward right so anyway erm
C	now you're making me worried you know how I am with diseases you know how I feel about them you know how much it worries me
D	well if you've got Ebola he's put it in your house and I've been round there so

B	yeah
C	and nobody even erm
D	no
C	in Kenya
D	alright you
B	yeah

A	yeah
C	I've got a headache actually
D	I've actually considered getting these testers
C	my head is
B	do you want a tester?
D	no I think we've got one on the wall but not one that makes a noise because the other night my house was really smoky and it was like two in the morning but I thought the house was on fire but it wasn't
C	do you know
D	cos we had the log burner on overnight
D	I've had a headache since Monday
B	what about what about carbon monoxide?
D	and I thought it was carbon monoxide
A	I think carbon monoxide would knock you out
B	that's that's
A	if it was if
B	carbon monoxide's more dangerous than Ebola
A	yeah
D	but what it was just a little bit over like a week
B	still not good for you

C	I er I
C	I ran into the bathroom and then I was like I genuinely didn't think you were still here and he was like ha ha ha anyway that's awkward enough as it is right? really quite awkward erm she was pissing herself about it and I was like he just saw everything like I'm not even
D	who was?
C	you
D	when you told me?
C	yeah
D	yeah yeah
C	erm I was like literally butt naked like there wasn't do you know what I mean? there was no shame there I walked out just like

A	so where's
D	he's at home we're going away tomorrow
A	oh I see oh
B	can you check where he is?

A	oh
D	his house
B	that's erm
A	it's intense isn't it?
[ANNOTATION]	someone is on holiday	Contradiction
B	it's pretty intense
D	and obviously he's gonna be wondering
B	can he?
D	where I am cos he doesn't know this location but yeah
B	he's been here a while
A	he's gonna think it's your other boyfriend's
B	actually actually that's nowhere us is it? we're on the other side of the road to them
D	oh that's near that's got some my work let me just refresh
[ANNOTATION]	someone has a boyfriend	Entailment
A	well you can stay there can't you?
D	oh no it's changing it's changing
B	but we don't our address is so new it might not come up
D	no it's still saying
B	that's miles away
A	oh that's cos it's him I thought that was the what the app was called
D	no the our circle's called
B	I dunno
A	have
D	no but I could get
B	oh that is where we are
A	so you could start spying on each other?
D	yeah
B	that is where we are
A	you'd be like oh you bitch you told me you were here
B	that is where we are but
D	is it right?
B	they think they think
D	oh it's probably just cos it's new
B	cos it's new yeah
D	but I can press this panic button here
B	like help me
D	and it'll send him this alert but he said we shouldn't mess around cos I kept doing it he's like er I don't think you should
A	well it's well exactly
D	I can't press it
A	it's kind of a good thing to have but if you joked about it if you ever needed it
D	yeah well I did keep doing it
D	yeah so we're going away tomorrow so got so much stuff to do I need to like pack and
A	that'll be nice though your long weekend?
D	yeah Friday Saturday Sunday mm
A	that's the second one you've been on this year isn't it?
D	yeah fucking love it
A	you like The Sun holidays
B	it's ten pound?
D	yeah it's
A	what is er what is it like? er what?
D	there's caravan parks all over there's like really nice ones like in the Lake District or there's even ones in the Cotswolds or like everywhere in England
B	yeah
D	just like Havens and stuff
A	yeah
D	erm Park Resorts we're going to which I don't think's very nice not as good as Haven and then there's some in like Italy round the lakes there's some in Cyprus there's all over obviously you pay for flights but
A	yeah
D	erm and you just it's just cheap and you can
A	yeah
D	upgrade your caravan you can upgrade your caravan or you can pay for extras but we don't cos the whole point of it is it's cheap
B	cheap
A	yeah
B	yeah
D	but we went to Cornwall in March and we actually spent more on the petrol cos we're just fucking dickheads
A	yeah
B	Cornwall
B	it's a long way
D	it took us so long
B	it's a long way from anywhere Cornwall isn't it?
D	it was freezing
A	Cornwall is long
D	yeah
B	I've never been
D	but and we went to like Polperro which is so small like the town you can't even drive into it because like it's just that small
A	yeah
D	erm but as I say we're going to like
A	somewhere closer
D	yeah
A	well that's a good idea though I I always see it and I never really
D	honestly just do it
B	it's like yeah I remember you mentioned that you'd do it like
A	oh yeah and you were raving about it and I was like oh
D	they do say
A	got round to actually checking
D	you're meant to collect ten tokens but we always do but if you just google it you can get all the codes they're just like words just random words
A	yeah
D	so you don't really need to do it you can just do it on the tenth day just google it
B	do you have to collect ten each? or is it?
D	no you just need ten ten numbers me and
B	is it one code per how many people?
D	erm up to four it's actually about it's a bit more than ten pound each cos it's based on four sharing
B	okay
D	so nine pound fifty times two so what was that? like
B	that's that's nineteen pounds
D	yeah
A	yeah
D	it's nineteen pounds each but if we had four people it would be nine fifty each so it's twenty quid each for
B	it's still really cheap
D	three nights away
A	yeah that's nice
B	mm
D	you can't even get a Travelodge for forty quid for one night
A	no
B	no
A	cos that's when when we go away it tends to be like you know like when the Premier Inn do like twenty-nine pound rooms? and then we
B	we go shopping somewhere or
D	mm
A	but that's still like thirty quid each
D	and it's in a
A	yeah
B	yeah
D	it's the caravan and it's ours and it's
A	yeah
D	and it's a caravan but it's like
B	do your own stuff
A	but you can do what you want
D	yeah
A	yeah
A	who was that?
B	who?
A	oh
D	what's wrong with him?
C	he's a twat that's all
D	why?
C	nothing
B	do you wanna check where he is?
C	mm
B	we know where er
D	we just know yeah
C	do we?
B	yeah he's at home don't worry
A	I was saying to
C	yeah
B	he leaves his phone at home? you don't know where he is
D	well you can turn off the location sharing but it wouldn't
D	told it off turned it off
B	no you'd have to actually check and see
D	well I dunno I don't know what it would do
B	oh wow
A	so it is flawed
D	well if he turns it off I would know I guess
A	cos you'd be like
D	where are you?
A	you've been at your house for ten hours
B	so it doesn't
D	no but I can yeah it does
D	it can give you like
B	notifications?
D	it it can give me like er in a list like I guess when you do that with your satnav you can get it listed can't you?
B	oh wow
A	that's so weird
D	the steps but also
A	that's really intense
D	it will erm like it literally shows
B	you're like
D	erm er yeah I clicked on it where he was and then you can click again and then it shows you another version and then you
D	and he was in
B	could you see him in there?
A	fuck me that's so
A	hello
B	she's just a friend
A	mm
D	but it is cool it is I know it's stalkerish but I don't even go on the app I just see the notification
A	yeah mm
B	yeah
B	right
A	it's erm it's it's a thing
B	yeah what were we talk we were talking
D	so carry on about
A	oh yeah what did he say about your naked body?
D	he said
B	mm mm
D	it was a start to his awesome day because then his er car passed its MOT and
A	it was the start to his awesome day?
D	and also
A	that's a bit cringe
D	he said by the time he'd
C	oh I I
D	he went
C	I really tried to focus hard and
B	wow
B	and she's just stood there like oh my god
D	my boyfriend's just tried to picture my best friend naked
B	yeah wow bit weird isn't it?
D	that would've freaked me out I'd be like er take that image out of your head
A	he probably
D	he was joking
A	but it would be er
D	I'm like he weren't
A	yeah but it if if it had been
D	and also it
A	it makes it more awkward
D	I would feel a bit perved by him
A	yeah
D	cos I think he's a bit pervy
B	I think he deliberately opened the door
B	he knew you were there
D	hang on if
C	she didn't see me
D	oh
A	no cos I can't imagine it was very it was like a
B	you weren't like
A	process
A	you'd have been like oh
B	oh
A	you might've run out into the toilet
D	he probably heard your door open and popped out to say hello but he
A	I mean I have to admit
D	didn't expect you to be naked
A	it's a slightly risky thing to do anyway really
B	yeah
C	yeah but I didn't think he was there and like I happily walk from
A	so
C	no he'd gone out in the morning to his car and come back in again or something
A	oh
B	yeah he was checking on the car yeah
D	he was tricking you he did it on purpose
A	he was tricking you it was all
B	he might start doing that more often
A	to get you naked
C	oh god
C	well thank you very much for that
D	yeah it was really nice
A	you're welcome
D	I'm so full
B	yeah good stuff
A	yeah
D	it was tasty I liked it
C	I'm stuffed now
A	it's always hard when
D	mm
A	I never know what to make
D	no
C	yeah
B	better than that pesto
A	that shit erm
C	it wasn't one of the finest things you've ever cooked I don't think
A	no I can't
C	but
A	I can't say I'd put a lot of thought into it
A	it just happened
B	oh god
A	how can you serve anybody that?
D	yeah you did actually
B	they're being so polite
B	they actually ate it
D	didn't you have cheese and biscuits after?
B	I just had cheese and biscuits
D	yeah
B	there wasn't even enough for four
D	so we did have a few of those didn't we?
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	mm
D	so is
C	I'm gonna go for a fag sorry
B	that's alright
C	yeah go out the back
A	I don't think so erm she she and
D	oh yeah whereabouts?
A	dunno
D	my friend
A	yeah
D	she's going to one tonight she's bought this top that says erm
A	nice
B	oh wow
A	I think it could be really good fun but I'd kind of wanna do it with you guys I don't think I'd wanna like I mean
A	I think it's
D	no I'd wanna do it with the girls
A	yeah
D	come with you
D	was she? she seemed pissed off
A	I don't think she er well it just didn't sound like a fun conversation I don't think
B	she's dying for a cig
D	don't really wanna
A	but no erm she did
D	she's just saying that
A	exactly that's that's her feeling guilty and wanting to kind of
D	yeah
A	to be my best friend or whatever erm so I just I was really blunt with her and I was like no I don't think I'm gonna need any help
B	fuck off
A	but like that's a weird thing to ask anyway
D	she clearly
A	like you know if I was like having a birthday party it's I dunno maybe it is normal to go er say do you want any help? but it's a housewarming like how much effort does she think I'm gonna fucking go to?
D	maybe she should just like come and see you instead of bailing
A	exactly like and er she
A	she definitely said erm she was gonna come when I first mentioned it as well so she's clearly at some point like made a decision that she'd rather go to the murder mystery
D	yeah
A	but she's being like
D	but
A	too pussy to actually say it
D	you asked her first
A	exactly
B	my best mate can't come
A	yeah
D	oh
A	so I'm kind of thinking I well
D	mm
A	made it at like three technically she could probably come for like a few hours
D	oh yeah
A	so
B	and so could
D	yeah I thought that was quite early
A	and so could
B	yeah we we
A	well
A	like they're going to some sort of gig or something in the evening
B	in
A	and then because we're doing a barbecue and stuff as well we thought oh it does we don't want it to be too late
B	I I reckon if people get here at three there's a bit of socialising by the time I've started doing a barbecue it's gonna be like four o'clock five o'clock anyway which is
A	yeah
B	we can eat at that time
D	yeah
B	and we've got an idea of
A	and then everybody can just get pissed
B	yeah and
A	yeah
B	it's
D	it's three days before my birthday as well
A	yeah
B	is it? yeah
D	and
B	yeah

A	and then you and you he's had to put you in the shit position of being like I'd rather you didn't cos now you look like the bad guy and it's
C	yeah
A	making you the bad guy
C	and I'm like I'm just so pissed off about it so I said to him when I finish here I'm gonna go round to his
D	and do what?
C	have a word with him
C	I'm gonna speak to him
C	I'm gonna say to him I'm gonna say to him er this is what I'm
B	she's gonna seduce him
C	tell me if er tell me
C	if you wanna do stuff and you wanna have everything planned all the time and you wanna like do stuff and and you don't wanna spend time with me then you need to reassess what we're doing
A	it's probably a bit intense
[ANNOTATION]	He has been making speaker C feel bad for a while.	Neutral
D	no I don't think you should say that
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker C should definitely say that.	Contradiction
A	that's a bit intense for him wanting to watch the boxing
C	yeah but the thing is er I'm always having to do something like everything is planned for me and I just
D	but
C	what? so I can't just spend any time with my boyfriend
A	but that
C	on my on my own?
A	but technically that is a
B	you still made plans
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker C has been dating him for four and a half years.	Neutral
C	we
B	yeah
C	at what point when I make plans with you do you think it's okay to make another plan?
B	well because you didn't have anything booked he probably didn't see it as a plan
C	what? so I have to fucking book an event?
B	no no no
C	to to spend quality time with him?
B	she's she's booked him she's booked him
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker C's partner used to be a boxer.	Neutral
A	yeah
D	that's what
B	and that's it
D	no but I mean er
B	and have that and have that
D	cos you didn't have anything like
C	so what would you say to him?
D	I would just
A	I'd just make him I
C	if you
A	you have to take another tact he's clearly not responding to you getting like aggy with him so just make him feel guilty as fuck
D	that's what I said that to you the other night
A	yeah
C	so what? what?
A	just kind of go there and be like look
B	disappointment it's the worst
A	disappointed is the worst right?
B	you know when your parents used to do disappointment?
A	just yeah just say like I was really looking forward to that weekend
D	just say like why don't you wanna spend time with me by ourselves?
A	I really wanted to spend time with you like I thought you
A	might've valued that like a little bit more
B	I'm I'm not angry I'm disappointed
C	yeah
B	oh no don't do that
C	I might just yeah I might just go to him I might just go to him look I'm just really disappointed that you didn't wanna you know you didn't you knew the plans
D	no no be like
A	really guilt trip him that's the only way he's gonna respond
D	actually
C	yeah and like say like be like
D	say I'm not stopping you
C	without other
D	from doing anything with friends
C	without other
B	yeah
C	like er like that's what I said to him the other night I said I'm not stopping you doing things I don't wanna be that girlfriend that stops you doing anything and I don't wanna stop you doing anything but I just feel that sometimes you need to get your priorities a little bit straight
D	no don't put it on him just tell him how much you wanna see him alone and it upsets you that he doesn't want to
B	I wanna see you alone
C	like I think he thinks like
D	er
C	just because we
D	that is not quality time
A	no
C	like that's me
D	that's doesn't count
C	I'm sleeping
B	it is quality time
C	do you know what I mean?
D	you two have quality time
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	too
B	yeah far too much time
D	I don't have any fucking quality time
B	it
D	I get quality time this weekend
B	we're trying to get rid of each other
A	it is it it sounds really bad but it is nice like
D	yeah I love it
B	yeah trying to just get rid of you
A	that weekend we were in
B	I left the house once
B	it was great
C	but like I think like it's just like with
B	he's on another level
C	he's on another level like he's always always having to do
A	I feel like even even though you like having company that it's not always like oh we have to be doing stuff
B	yeah
C	no
B	so your company when when you've lived with
C	yeah
B	so now
C	yeah
B	and that can be a
C	yeah
A	more
C	and it's like
D	yeah he just always likes
B	yeah
C	and like I think that like we will do stuff together and like we do stuff together if we were doing something together and we were together we'd still be talking as much as we'd be talking if we were sitting and
A	yeah
A	yeah
C	and we will sit on we will we are fine together that's fine but
A	yeah
C	cos he's so used to be doing something like he travelled for two-and-a-half years and he was always doing something so like now he's back he's filling his time with doing other things
D	yeah but that's the good thing about being in a relationship things do change
A	mm
C	er
D	do you know what? my favourite things my favourite
C	but I don't know what to say I don't know what to say to him
A	it it takes it takes time you know and and it I think the difficulty with it being as well like you said he's in a position where he's living at home for free so all the money he's getting in each month he can kind of do what he likes with it
D	he should be saving it
A	and so what's happening is he's kind of he is he's spending it he's like oh I've got the money so I'll do this and I'll do that and I'll do if he was in a situation where he was a little bit more constricted that's when you start making the decisions oh well I won't go out as often cos I can't actually afford to do that
D	or you do stuff that's free
A	yeah
D	like having a night in like my favourite weekend is when I don't have anything on literally when I haven't got anything to do and I just know that I've got
A	yeah
D	and just having nothing
B	we we we catch up on TV and stuff
A	yeah
D	yeah
B	yeah
A	and like
D	and watch films in bed
A	I
B	yeah
A	I keep saying every weekend I'm like I'd really like to go for a walk like just spend a couple of hours just going for a walk we haven't we've
D	it's a nice idea but when you actually do it
D	it's a bit like oh fuck that
A	never find the time
C	well I dunno I'm just getting a bit
A	I would
C	pissed off
A	yeah but there's only so much there's
D	and just sees you really neggie like
A	so you just kind of have to
A	just guilt trip him that's the only way to go just kind of think to yourself well I am disappointed but rather than going there and being like oh er blah blah blah blah just say look I'm upset obviously I wanted to spend the weekend with you I was looking forward to it I
C	yeah
D	don't go in having a go at him
C	no
D	I know you will
C	I'm not going to
B	er yeah play
C	I actually I'm actually I'm not like I'm so bored of it
A	yeah
D	just show him that you're upset cos if you he sees you being like aggy he doesn't actually know that it's upsetting you whereas it is upsetting you but he doesn't know that cos you're always aggy about it
B	he just thinks you're angry yeah
C	yeah
A	yeah
D	he doesn't see that you're truly just wanting him alone just quality time he probably sees it as you just trying to be aggy
C	it's like I said to him like I'm not gonna force you to spend time with me if you don't want to then you don't want to but
A	mm
C	like
A	we've got ice cream by the way I don't know how good you're being at the moment but
D	I'm too full
C	I'm
A	mm
D	I actually can't really be late
C	and
B	we erm
A	yeah
C	so
A	I actually
A	really wanna I don't know if you've seen it advertised you know Zane Lowe's rescored Drive?
B	oh yeah yeah yeah
D	what?
A	erm the movie Drive
D	yeah
A	erm Zane Lowe's basically rescored it so like you know like the soundtrack?
D	yeah
A	the music that happens in the background they've erm he's commissioned a load of artists to write brand new music specifically for that film and they're showing the film tonight on BBC three at ten
D	oh god
A	with a completely new soundtrack all new music from different artists
B	but we really like that film
A	I love it's
D	that's quite a cool idea though isn't it?
A	it's one of my favourite films and the soundtrack
B	yeah but
A	the original soundtrack
B	the soundtrack is amazing
A	is amazing so it's kind of one of those ideas like
B	and makes the film
A	I think it's I like I don't like the idea cos I'm like why mess with something that's already that good? but I'm so intrigued to see what it's actually like
D	you gonna watch it?
B	yeah
A	that I'm gonna have to watch it yeah because it's so it's such an iconic movie like there's no have you watched it? there's like
D	I probably have but
B	there's barely any dialogue
D	I've got the worst memory
A	there's no dialogue basically so it's all about the music and it's so like it's so intense
D	what happens in it?
A	it's basically it's Ryan Gosling and he
D	oh I think I have seen it
A	he's like a stunt man in movies and he does like er jobs for people if they're like robbing banks and all this kind of shit
B	he's a getaway driver basically
A	yeah erm but he ends up he lives in some like shitty flat ends up befriending a female neighbour whose husband's gone to prison for one thing or another and her son and it's kind of all about like their relationship
D	yeah I have seen this
B	yeah
A	yeah but it's so intense and so like moody and it's all like it's all about the soundtrack and I don't know how but then
D	you seem really excited about this thing
A	I know because Zane Lowe was talking about it and I didn't
D	who was who were the bands?
A	erm there's like loads of different loads and loads of different people like er
B	Chvrches Bastille
A	yeah what's it like
B	Bring Me the Horizon
A	yeah
D	Zane Lowe's decent though
A	he knows what he's doing and he's picked like The 1975 I think he's picked like loads of different
A	really different types of music
D	did you
B	what?
D	did you say no you don't like Zane Lowe?
B	erm
A	he's a bit intense as a person
D	yeah
B	yeah he's
D	he's a bit weird
A	erm but he does
B	he's very opinionated
A	he does know his music
B	but he knows he knows music
A	yeah and he's basically like I said he's given this film to bands and he's said right I want you to write a song for this scene
D	mm
A	and they've actually written like it's brand new music so it's not as if they've gone oh well here's a song off my album
D	yeah
A	they've actually like written music for it so I'm like that could actually be quite cool
D	so are you gonna watch that?
A	so I'm gonna watch
A	it could be shit because I think it might be shit but
D	but you'd still you need to watch it
D	you can't not watch it
A	you need to watch it to say it's shit
D	that's like a whole new soundtrack for Moulin Rouge and me not being able to watch it
A	exactly
B	er Foals whoever who oh
A	subtract is it?
D	oh yeah
A	yeah
B	Banks The 1975 Baauer erm Banks Bastille Bring Me the Horizon Eric Prydz Jon Hopkins Laura Mvula Laura Mvula
D	yeah
B	erm The Neighbourhood whoever they are
D	there's quite a mix in there
A	yeah
D	like
A	I heard that Bring Me the Horizon song today and it's really it's a bit like it's quite rocky
B	sorry that was SoundCloud
A	but yeah
C	mm
A	it could be really good or it could be shit
A	that you guys
B	SoundCloud
A	need to get if you need to crack on and stuff
C	yeah no
D	well we wanna leave early in the morning
C	so lovely though
A	but I want yeah I wanna do this like
D	if I had a house I'd definitely

B	yeah
D	and he his family like all sit together and don't even turn the telly on they talk to each other

B	just talk what do they talk about?
D	well they just talk about people I don't even fucking give a shit about
D	they talk about like his auntie and his cousins and they just slag them all off and it's
D	so boring because his sister's got ME so she never goes out the house she doesn't leave the house right?
B	oh
A	how old is she?
D	and if she does she sits in like she's twenty-six and she'll sit on the front doorstep and get fresh air like she just doesn't go away

A	tut oh
D	cos it takes all your energy
A	it's really
B	yeah
A	my cousin had it for a while
D	yeah it's bad so anything that goes on in that house
A	mm?
B	you get over it?
A	yeah
B	oh
D	it is it can be right she's got it bad like she can't do anything really but so everything that goes on is like a massive deal to her like me just going round after work is like the highlight of her day cos nothing happened in her life
A	ah
D	her life is so boring so she gossips and it's so annoying like I can't listen to it
B	she should get like be like an online game role or do something like
D	she's got a blog
B	Ebay Ebay shit
D	that's really really popular like a thousand people read her blog I read her blog
B	yeah
D	it's really good it actually made me cry once
A	what's it about?
D	her having ME it's called
B	you wanna
D	and I read it to
D	you came to this she had this ME tea party
C	do her erm fucking whatchamacallit her erm
A	her Snapchat today wanted me

A	made me want to throw my phone at
D	oh
C	don't don't we are going absolutely batshit about it
D	did you see her duty free purchases as well the other day?
C	in her with her Ted
A	no I I literally just saw her
C	don't because she
D	oh no she had a
C	honestly
D	Coco Chanel perfume
C	we are
D	and then in the background
C	a different level
D	was a Louis Vuitton no a Michael Kors bag a Ted Baker suitcase a new Coco Chanel perfume and then another designer thing
A	one thing you should know about
B	mm
A	because she never has to spend anything or
C	but she doesn't have a shit ton er ton of money
D	she doesn't she's got a ten grand credit
C	she's got a ten grand credit card that she's pretty much maxed out
C	and she doesn't earn shitloads of money
A	so that's what she spends
D	she's and she and an overdraft
C	sorry that was
B	she's just doing what you did years ago
C	mm
D	yeah
B	and she's not learnt
A	that's so bad I didn't realise she was using credit I just thought it was because she earned
C	er no
A	earned decent
D	the thing is she wants to apply for a mortgage yeah? so she can invest in a house and rent it out but she got she's gotta pay her debts off cos her dad doesn't know about the credit card and that whilst she's applying for this mortgage but he's gonna find out
A	why would he know what her finances are anyway if if if
D	cos obviously he'll get involved
C	yeah he'll probably
D	and if he's gonna help her out
C	put money into the house as an investment
D	she's been saving though
A	I had I had I had eight
D	what smell is that?
A	I had an eight grand loan
A	when I applied for my mortgage though and it doesn't matter
B	you had what?
A	I I had an eight grand loan well I still do
B	you've got an eight grand loan?
A	ah
B	oh my god
A	my masters stuff so
C	yeah
D	yeah but she basically just spends all her money every month
A	on what?
D	she bought that
A	on a fucking suitcase?
D	a hand luggage suitcase
A	and it was like a plasticky suitcase that's quite clearly gonna get fucking battered
C	yeah
A	oh well
A	well
C	right well thank you very
