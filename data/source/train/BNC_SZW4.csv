A	so erm yeah it's this poetry by heart competition and basically you have to like recite two poems
B	yeah
A	and then you get judged on your like understanding of it and your performance of it
B	oh okay
A	yeah they've got like this selection online so it's other people's poems you recite
B	yeah yeah
A	erm and yeah it sounds quite interesting and then you kind of progress through stages so if like I think it might only be one winner from the school it might be two then you go to like the regional ones and then
B	right yeah
A	bigger ones
B	so you're you're just keeping to the same two poems throughout the heats then they're not going to ask you to do
A	ah I'm not sure I think maybe when you get to like the semis or something you can change them
B	right
A	but erm
B	but why would you when you've analysed and
A	well no you might you might have to change them when you get to the finals to show that you can actually change it up a bit
B	yeah right yeah
B	ah right so
A	no cos I didn't have the link to it before but I've emailed the lady at my school who's doing it who's also my English language teacher
B	yeah
A	I thought she hadn't emailed me back so I went to my English lit teacher who told us about it in the first place so then I was like oh I emailed the lady but they didn't email me back

B	but no I'd I'd like this morning as it's a Monday I kind of went to a the shop up the road and just got a load of salady stuff and and bits for lunch so that's what I'm doing I'm just like ah there's these really lovely tomato things at the moment
A	well done
B	piccolo tomatoes I've never known myself to get you know? so passionate about tomatoes
A	passionate about tomatoes
B	but I tell you they're so tasty so I bought two packs today one for work and one for home so that you could experience the loveliness
A	oh great are they? are they small?
B	they are they're like cherry tomatoes but they're full of flavour
A	cool
B	really nice
A	mm
B	so I don't think I can put them in a smoothie though sadly you know? spinach is probably the you know? level
A	ah no it's like there's that quote isn't it?
A	intelligence is knowing that tomato is a fruit wisdom is knowing not to put it in a fruit salad
A	I like that one
A	I do like that
B	yes indeedy
A	yeah you've got to do my dinner tonight
B	oh have I got to? really? is there no choice? really?
A	yeah cos there's like no food like so
A	what?
B	erm they're now doing some mini naans sort of almost like pitta shape naan breads
A	yeah
B	yeah I mean they're plain they're not
A	ah ah
B	but you know?
A	nice yeah oh naan
B	so I could do a soup we could dunk the naan
A	yes
B	or yeah I could do sort of like a curried type soup I've probably got some chickpeas
A	soup
B	and yeah soup soup soup okay
A	that rice was so nice having it for lunch today I was like this is amazing
B	was it? ah
A	it tasted really good that fish was spot on
B	oh good I'm glad
A	sometimes it's a bit dry but today it was not dry it was
B	yes yeah no I I didn't overpoach it sometimes I yeah if I've got the other stuff on the go I'm not always as attendant to the time on that haddock
A	yeah mm
B	but yeah it was it was
A	it was great well done
B	thank you
A	cooking achievement right there
A	daddy was saying he wants to make some more apple crumble but he doesn't have any sugar cos he's just put it all in the wine so
B	oh I know gosh he's done four gallons of apple wine today that's crazy and I've already got two gallons sort of you know four weeks in
A	oh my god
B	so I don't know what he's trying to do to me cos I'm the only one drinking it well unless
A	well he's going to give it away as Christmas gifts
B	oh oh alright thank goodness for that cos I'm thinking this is going to take me till next
B	yeah
A	I well I
B	cool okay
A	give some away to people
B	well I'd quite like to keep some of the first batch that he had on cos I I had a taster three and a half weeks in and that was it's his best yet actually
A	really oh wow
B	yeah yeah it's definitely his best yet but he is like going crazy with the the
A	right
B	but the the four-gallon one is about I think it was nought point nought point eight six or something erm and the the free week in wine that I've tried was a nought point nine and that was that was almost like a spirit almost when I tasted it
A	oh my god
B	you know I mean it won't be it won't be to that level but it will probably be about the right level you know? it should be for wine cos the wine
A	oh
B	the previous wines he's been doing are I get the feeling they've been quite weak they've probably only been about six seven percent whereas most standard bottles of wine would be about thirteen percent probably
A	oh blimey
B	so erm and he did say to me he admitted today that the readings for all the previous batches of wine were probably more like nought point five nought point six
A	right
B	so yeah so yeah it's going to be interesting
A	yeah
B	but I said to him I'd really like a red wine cos we've got we've still got so many apples and I was wondering can we not put some apple fruit in with it you know?
A	yeah
B	but he he's seen some cranberries dried cranberries that you can buy online erm which would probably make a really good red wine
A	oh right
B	well I mean you know? red grapes or
A	oh
B	what's the word?
A	yeah it's
B	and some red wines you get you know? they they have that richness that tanginess so
A	I'll take your word for it
B	oh right then
B	yeah you're never likely to
A	no
B	so anyway how did we get onto wine where were we?
A	I don't know food
B	food hungry food fruits
A	well yeah
B	food yeah yeah so we were talking ah sorry am I squeaking on there? yeah yeah
B	okay erm yeah I'll do a curried soup I think
A	probably not
B	to just sort of flesh it out a bit so I'm going to have to think as well for vegetables to
A	yeah
B	flesh it out mm we will see
A	I keep forgetting that half term's a week after next already
B	wait no it's next week isn't it?

B	er it's been half half full
A	mm
B	half houses but I mean like the audience yesterday even though there was like sixty-five
A	yeah it's a hundred and something
B	yeah yeah erm they were really they were our best audience yet actually yesterday
A	yeah you were saying it was good
B	they were really appreciative and they really got it I mean it's so funny the first play it kind of almost really warms them up cos it's a short
A	yeah
B	sort of thirty-five minute comedy and it's really silly
A	yeah
B	you have to pay a bit more attention er I won't give too much away obviously
A	no hush hush
B	yes but er yeah it's good cos it kind of primes them for that really
A	right
B	but it's a very different comedy
A	mm hm
B	very different yeah so they they were very appreciative and there's always one line in Game of Speculation not everybody it's funny it's surprising what people laugh at and what they don't laugh at
A	yeah?
B	erm er but there's always one line in Game of Speculation that gets everybody you know? everyone laughs at it whereas others you can never be sure if they'll fully get the joke
A	yeah yeah yeah yeah
B	how much are they paying attention or just you know? have they connected?
A	yeah we we had a bit of that in
B	did you? yeah
A	yeah there's some in it it'd be like are they going to laugh at it tonight?
B	right
A	and there was one audience
B	really? gosh
B	yes yes
A	like you could probably gauge how funny an audience found it by how loud their reaction to that was on one night people were just really falling about laughing with it
B	falling about brilliant
A	but other times it's be like
B	yeah yeah
A	like this is funny we made this
A	you're supposed to laugh now don't give me the line because
B	no I'm not going to give you the line no no
A	yeah
B	see see what you think but it's lovely as well cos when they do the curtain call at the end er box and cox the two main characters for the first play
A	yeah yeah
B	they also are in the second play
A	second play
B	and they're a pair in the second play
A	ah
B	which is lovely so we had one occasion where when they came onto stage cos they come in about half an hour in
A	yeah
B	the audience gave them a little
A	yeah
B	and they always get the biggest clap at the end
A	at the end
B	the last three people on are box and cox from the first one and mister hawk who he he's terrific
A	right
B	he's in practically every scene you know?
