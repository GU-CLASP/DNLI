B	there
A	no that's not a nice place see I had that in a perfect place no it's too close to the other ones you need to do it so that it's spaced out evenly then you do more so that there's still so it's like proportionally spaced out
E	proportionally? good heavens
B	note to the
A	but you see what I mean don't you?
B	note to the person who's transcribing I've got a sarcastic look on my face
B	and the answer is no not until
F	our verdict
B	March
F	if your flat screen TV is at least eight years old you are most likely missing out on full HD much improved sound and a crystal clear picture you'll have a much better TV viewing experience if you upgrade
A	I don't think she cares
F	there you go
B	is it in brackets but not until it's your proper birthday you're not having another present too early?
F	only upgrade if you really want a smart TV otherwise we would suggest waiting until four K models come down in price and more content is available for them
B	there you are then might as well wait
F	I'll wait till March
E	wait for what?
B	sixtieth birthday
F	I'll wait till March then
E	what what advantage have they got then? what is this four K?
F	the four K is the new ultra ultra
E	yeah
F	they're much more pixels and much clearer picture
E	oh what about the sound
F	and it's like
E	side of it?
F	of the what sorry?
E	sound
F	sound?
unknown_female	mm
unknown_female	what's that?
E	that's er that's the problem that we have
F	well they reckon the sound so the latest TVs the sound is better than a few
E	mm
F	but
B	we haven't
A	no that's what I was thinking
B	you keep going with silver and I'll
A	alright
F	well they don't say a lot about the sound to be honest with you
E	no
F	it's better than obviously the sound on ours but they're
E	no no
F	they are improving it gradually even if it's a small telly I think it's they're sort of
D	oh
F	general trend on here
E	you can see eventually they'll
F	yeah
E	so that you get better sound
F	yeah
E	so we've done full circle then
F	yeah
E	are these all tied together?
F	oh no
B	no
E	well I wouldn't dare put one on because it would upset
A	hey don't
A	put it on there

E	it means
A	I know
E	getting er getting a result from having witnessed other similar proceedings or things in the first place
B	oh that's not what I was gonna say
E	yeah extrapolation is is using the data you've got to get other data
B	well
F	oh right
B	is like taking and teasing out information extrapolate data
A	yeah take something out yeah
B	we've got a different definition to you dad
E	yes?
B	we thought it was like if you extrapolate data you sort of take a like a mass of data and you
E	oh you erm tease out the bits you need for the purpose that you're that you're looking at it erm
B	yeah okay
E	because we
B	yeah that's what I
E	and then we erm from that we could say well we want something to represent between the hours of twelve and one erm so we'd look at a different data
B	yeah
E	blank does that make sense? or is that a bit?
B	yeah well
B	you can have one of my red ones
A	well give me never mind

B	fairs
B	three more
A	and are these all gonna have the the things? ow
F	here's a good
B	are we allowed to
A	yeah fine
B	that's a bit bare there
F	it talks about this TV it says it's a good but that said should you have the budget and space to accommodate the larger set it's probably wiser to opt for the fifteen Sony KDL five 0 W eight two nine which is equipped with blur busting motion interpolation technology
E	there we go
E	well that should be good then
F	yeah
E	blur busting?
F	whatever that whatever that means
E	blur busting?
F	blur busting motion interpolation technology
B	ah pretty
F	there you go
E	haven't got a clue what that means
F	sounds good to me
E	mm oh
A	you need to put the erm
E	by Jove it's come back
F	right
B	yeah just done that do you want the lametta on? I don't like lametta

B	a little bit? there you go dad?
A	no I like it I think it's cool
E	you can you can go mad and the whole tree gets
B	yeah
E	gets erm
F	oh yeah don't put too much on
E	overloaded with lametta and you can't see anything but blooming lametta
B	I think
A	it I thought you just have to just sort of chuck it on so it can be like natural
A	it doesn't look good
B	well you've you've chucked creatively
A	no you can't
A	preferably
B	if you
A	preferably
F	be a big
A	don't make the noise
F	be a big crash in a minute and you'll end up in the middle of the tree
A	don't no don't do like clumps of it
A	get off me
B	just dangle it on people actually it works really well
A	it's your own fault
F	that's made a mess
B	er for the purpose of the recording she's just assaulted me
A	no I haven't
B	well we can fill up the back with lametta look
A	yeah
B	er it's alright if you just dangle tiny bits of it it's not too
E	make it sound like there's a bit hole round the back
E	yeah but like I was saying the door you get some people coming along to the back door don't you?

E	yeah
A	that's what I said
E	yeah
E	yeah you try and try and do sort of individual bits you get a better effect
A	you're dropping loads
E	could do with a bit down that area there
B	yeah?
E	probably get wiped off when people go through but
A	yeah
E	I think really that's probably enough now otherwise you start to lose the tree then
B	yeah just has to add some more

C	yeah the the
C	but you can just ignore the smart function and just use it as a TV
F	yeah
C	you can get a decent TV
A	yeah but then you have to pay more just for the smart
F	I'd rather go for
C	well er

C	yeah
E	yeah
F	and it's set up ready for
E	it's
F	when all these new ultra HD things come out

F	mm
C	four K
F	right
C	and they haven't even got the HDMI system that can handle four K

C	it's the high quality it's the
F	they reckon

F	well if you're set up for it yeah

B	yeah I will do
B	yeah
E	I think we I think we sort of when we started drinking wine we
A	thank you mm
E	expanded to to red wine at a certain stage and then we got fed up with er red
D	well rosé
E	cos the red wine was too heavy
D	I like er I like red wine but one glass is enough
E	mm
A	no I'll have a wine I'll be sophisticated and then I'll be
E	oh
A	an adult for once
E	oh
D	I think you are an adult madam
A	I don't feel like one I still feel like a kid
unknown_female	in some ways
D	did you manage alright when all the electric and water was off? did you have food and drink and?
A	yeah well we had we had water anyway and because we had gas erm cookers we were fine
D	mm yeah
A	just needed the light to see what we were doing and and
E	mm
A	erm
E	mm
A	and we had candles and stuff so we were fine
E	so it didn't bother you that much really then?
A	well apart from having like no light in the evening and no electricity or anything
E	what about heating?
A	no we didn't have heating but erm
A	we had water we had cold water but
D	yeah
A	hot water
D	because
E	no well they
A	no cos theirs was
E	that
A	theirs they
D	mm
A	get their water differently I can't remember
E	theirs theirs
E	has to be pumped up
A	yeah yeah pumped like erm ours isn't like
E	you can't just turn a turn a tap and it'll run out
A	mm
E	where where they are because it's very height dependent
A	yeah
D	yeah so it weren't too too bad for you?
A	no I quite enjoyed it it was a change to be honest and we had enough food so we were fine
D	mm
E	good
A	I mean there was erm there was a shop that's round the corner from us anyway erm and on one of the days when the electricity was still out they opened it was open
E	mm
A	and they just let one person in at a time to get stuff because they didn't have fridge stuff anyway it's just like a corner shop
A	so we just went to get a couple of things from there anyway so we were fine
D	why did they only let one person in at a time?
E	safety I should think
A	because yeah safety and they don't have an electricity and they can't do
E	and you can't see to get around anything
D	oh I see
A	and they don't have the cash registers or anything so they don't
E	no
A	they wanna make sure that they do it one person like choose somebody
D	yeah
A	so that they can check that they're
D	yeah well you can't blame them can you?
A	no no no I'm not blaming them
E	no not at all not at all
A	I'm just saying
D	I mean the thing is you hear about some of these houses that have been flooded out and people have moved out and the thieves are moving in and taking anything they can find
E	oh yeah mm
D	and
A	yeah well there was erm there was somebody that posted on a Facebook group for
F	is he still there?
A	well we went to put it inside when we went to
F	oh you went back did you?
A	cos it was the day before we got the train erm that I saw the post so I said when we go to
E	mm
A	get stolen
D	yeah
A	it's unlikely that it would've got stolen anyway it's it's in the backyard and you can't see it but just to be safe
F	mm
D	well yeah but I mean er er isn't it awful? that people get you know hundred and hundreds of people are supporting the victims and trying to raise money and
A	yeah
D	Christmas presents for the kids and things like this and yet you get the thieves that go along the
A	yeah
D	road just thieving
A	yeah
D	taking what they can and there can't be much that hasn't been ruined unless they go upstairs and take stuff and
A	yeah
E	well they'll just get in for easy pickings won't they?
D	get whatever they can get
E	they'll just
D	yeah
E	get whatever they can
B	mm
C	with each other and all the rest of it and that's what this programme gives you a complete list of them all so you can decide how much you wanted to
B	yeah
C	communicate with other things or so it's it's not perfect but it's it certainly seems to be fairly
B	yeah
C	solid
B	I've

D	she really is a character
A	mm
D	erm she was saying that the er they've moved out there well they're still trying to get the house straight erm and they they put the electricity off for twenty-two hours to save money in the village you know the mayor does it I think she said it was the mayor that switches it off
E	the mayor yeah
D	to save money
E	yeah
A	yeah
D	so you might get up and there's no electricity and they do the same with water every now and then they clean all the pipes out
A	mm
D	but they don't warn anybody
D	they don't say
E	it just goes off
D	yeah
A	oh
D	they don't say right next Tuesday at four o'clock we're putting the water off for six hours or something like that
A	mm
D	erm they just go to get water and there isn't any or they go to get
D	electricity and there isn't any
E	yeah
D	erm
A	yeah
D	just unbelievable but they seem to
D	yeah they're waiting for furniture to be delivered and that hasn't come and
A	mm

E	it does yeah it does doesn't it?
A	one of my one of my closest friends at uni she lives round the corner she's Bulgarian

A	yeah yeah
E	yeah
D	mm well I erm
A	mm
D	totally something
A	mm
D	erm and she was saying about this hotel this day out and the people that run it they organise nature walks and hill walks and all whatever in the summer and
A	yeah
D	erm skiing in the winter but she said it's just er she said the Bulgarians love the English

D	and they were chopping trees down ready
E	mm
D	to cope with this winter coming erm but they didn't seem to have enough at the moment and they're hoping that
