A	yeah it's a nice guy yeah
B	yeah
A	mm yeah how long are they here for?
B	erm couple of weeks I think
A	yeah
B	they've going to like
A	yeah
B	but I've not finished a book I'm still reading this Birdman of Alcatraz book
A	mm
B	remember that Birdman of Alcatraz? it was a Burt Lancaster film
A	what's that about?
B	it's about this convict who becomes an expert in birds
A	mm
B	and but he's not really that much of an expert and he was a total con
B	I mean in the film he's like you know he's really hard done
A	right
B	it's Burt Lancaster
B	but in reality he was a dirty fucking paedophile
B	but but incredibly honest apparently
B	you know like pointedly honest you know why the reason he got put inside
B	you know he he
B	total psycho
A	yeah? like
A	like what?
B	well
B	and you know a lot of his books and the like have been disproved it's like you'd kill a bird if you gave him that you can't and this
A	yeah
B	this disease doesn't occur in birds it's only in humans
B	he was writing all these big
A	just passing the time
B	yeah
B	well he was in well he was in solitary confinement for life
A	jesus
B	yeah
A	yeah you're you're gonna lose er but he had a pen and paper
B	well no he
A	what did he
B	he had a
A	publish his
B	whole aviary
A	oh right
B	he had cos he well the story goes he found a couple of birds in the prison yard at Leavenworth and this is
A	he killed a guard?
B	yeah
B	and erm
A	yeah
B	you know erm for publishing in
B	erm
B	you know
A	so he must have had light
B	from his prison cell
A	it wasn't like one of those dark
B	no no
A	so he wasn't right
B	he just he was just in total solitary for life
A	yeah
B	he wasn't he he wasn't in like er
A	yeah
B	D block as they called it
A	the hole
B	as they called it yeah he weren't in the hole
A	yeah
B	he was just in solitude for life
B	and yeah he he had birds and you know and cages and stuff and
A	wow
B	and I think apparently he did make some proper discoveries but a lot of it was just bullshit
B	it was it was
B	well he didn't no it was it was Leavenworth they call him the Birdman of Alcatraz cos that's what the film's called but
A	oh
B	erm
A	yeah
B	but he's only just been moved to Alcatraz in the book so I don't know what happens in Alcatraz
A	oh okay
B	I think he was didn't have such a happy in
A	right
B	Alcatraz
B	not far like a mile and a half
A	yeah
B	currents and sharks
A	mm
B	Clint Eastwood tried in the movie
B	but I
B	you've never seen Escape from Alcatraz?
A	no
B	fantastic
A	no no
B	it's great
A	it's one of yeah I don't know why I haven't seen that
B	oh it's good you wanna watch it
B	oh that's
B	a cracker isn't it? I love Escape from New York
B	that was one of those films you
B	you know when when you first get your VCR? well you
B	probably had one when you were young but I I think we first got ours when I was thirteen
A	yeah
B	and it was just you know they say never judge a book but it's cover but you always judged videos by the picture
B	wow this looks amazing
A	yeah
A	mm
B	in the eighties you know the the stuff that was at the
B	top of the video charts
A	mm
B	often hasn't it hadn't even been released in cinemas it was a totally different culture to
A	mm yeah yeah
B	you know and it's I wanna I wanna see this Escape from New York yeah
A	yeah Snake Blitsen
B	Snake
B	yeah
B	well that's when I used to
B	you know
A	yeah
B	and I remember once my mum coming down
B	like why are you watching this sort of thing?
B	and now you know I just did a lecture on video nasties a few weeks ago I mean it's
A	yeah
B	turned into a career in some way
A	there you go
B	The Stuff
A	The Stuff
B	saw that at the pictures
A	yeah?
B	yeah oh
A	bloody hell you've got a weird taste in films
B	mm
B	I must say I have to admit I don't think I've seen it since
A	yeah
B	not in the last
A	I remember the the last scene is
B	thirty years
A	when they've
B	oh right
B	I used to love all that low budget shit I still do
A	yeah yeah I do yeah I I prefer that
B	yeah
A	yeah mm
B	mm I mean
A	Mask as well
B	Mask mm The Elephant Man is proper they had really I I love it but it really pisses some people off cos
A	does it?
B	it is a total lie
A	oh
B	John Merrick was was and he's called Joseph in the film or is he called Joseph in real life it's he's called John in the film and in terms of you know
A	yeah
B	he had to change certain things so that
A	yeah
B	there couldn't be too much legal action but
A	right
B	he was treated very well you know
A	really? what his whole life?
B	he was yeah by by his by his handler by his you know the you know not very well I mean
A	mm
B	they weren't treated like kings but freaks were
A	yeah
B	very well regarded people aspired to be freaks and but
A	mm
B	and you know with
A	yeah
B	not without justification but overall you know
A	yeah
B	they didn't just use people you know
A	yeah
B	these people were stars and Joseph Merrick was a star you know
A	yeah
B	and he would have got a good about of money
A	yeah
B	and it made out Frederick Treves to be a saint and his handler his the showman he was
A	yeah
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	but apparently that's just not true
A	yeah
B	and they had to change a lot of stuff before they made the film because
A	still alive?
B	yeah he'd sued the er the stage the people who wrote the stage play
A	fair enough
B	it's not it's still
A	yeah
B	it's a great film and
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	I'm mean even though it's lies you know it's it's David Lynch I mean what
A	well I mean it's like when you see based on a true story
A	well yeah
B	yeah
A	someone's name was the same or
B	but I used to I've done some work on very early cinema when I was a film archivist and there was this lady I can't remember her name now
A	right
B	who were show folk so she's
A	yeah
B	really furious
B	that they get such a bad reputation
A	yeah
B	cos it wasn't like that it just
A	yeah
B	genuinely wasn't and we love the stories but
A	yeah
B	it just wasn't you know there was a sort of amongst carny folk there was certain
A	yeah
B	codes of honour and stuff and you had to be
A	yeah
B	like nice to animals and
A	what about freaks?
B	ah well and freaks
A	it's like
B	yeah yeah
A	I haven't seen that in a while actually I can't remember the exact storyline I
B	do you remember the end?
A	no
B	see
A	didn't someone
B	well they put they stuck his head on a chicken
A	right
B	they stuck his head on a fucking chicken
A	on a chicken?
B	on a chicken
B	I mean you know it's there's such a bizarre ending and every time I I think about it and I think did they really have that ending?
B	and then I watch it and yeah it does yeah like even now I'm thinking it can't they can't stick his head on a chicken
B	and it's like how did it work? how the head's as big as a chicken but yeah it's weird
B	total weird film
A	yeah
B	oh Häxan yeah
A	and er the erm
B	have you ever seen the
A	Faust
B	version of that from the sixties? oh Faust yeah the have you ever see the sixties version of Häxan?
A	no no
B	it's you know reedited it's got like a jazz score and William Burroughs does a narration of it
A	yeah?
B	which I've I've never seen it
A	oh okay
B	er it's a freebie on
B	the er the deluxe version of Häxan
A	mm
B	which I don't have it now but Häxan's a fantastic
A	yeah
B	it is just
A	it's brilliant
B	brilliant and I think he worked at Hollywood didn't he the guy who made it eventually
A	dunno
B	erm
A	is it Swedish? or
B	it was Swedish
A	yeah
B	yeah
B	cos it is it's supposed to be debunking witchcraft
A	mm
B	but
A	yeah
B	it's still terrifying
B	perfect Halloween film
A	yeah it's scary
B	yeah the the devil you know that guy
A	yeah
B	that that's the guy who directed it that's the
A	oh really?
B	director yeah
A	and the woman are coming up and he's like slapping their arses
A	it's great and yeah well
B	yeah it's got I I saw it when did I see it?
A	mm
B	it's one of those films
A	mm
B	read it off er Love Film or something
A	yeah
B	oh yeah
A	that's a good one
B	yeah?
B	oh sorry were you sleeping?
A	but again I can't remember
B	oh it's about the the the the brain and the
A	yeah okay okay I oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
B	oh it ends all all nice
A	is there a revolution?
B	I mean
A	oh it's
B	no they they had a
A	oh really?
B	happy ending
A	yeah
B	which kind of undermines the film a bit
A	yeah yeah
B	yeah
A	but it's still you know
A	yeah
B	but it gets restored you know
A	mm
B	every few years cos every couple of years they'll find like an extra two minutes of it
B	in in a
B	yeah
A	he's one you know great
B	I think of him I find him a bit sentimental sometimes some of the slapstick stuff's amazing though I mean
A	yeah
B	to get it right
A	and who was the guy that was on the erm on the clock was the
B	that's Harold Lloyd
A	yeah
B	yeah Safety Last
A	Safety
B	you got
A	Last that's it
B	yeah
B	yeah he gets kind of forgotten about
A	yeah
B	you hear Chaplin and Buster Keaton
A	yeah
B	but people kind of forget underrate Harold Lloyd
A	yeah
B	a little bit don't they?
A	mm
B	mm
A	mm
B	Laurel and Hardy were my favourites though
A	yeah? I never
B	well that was seventies I think
A	I think it was the cartoon that I'm more familiar with
B	you ever seen The Music Box?
A	no
B	where they try and get the
[ANNOTATION]	A has never seen The Music Box.	Entailment
A	I think I've seen scenes from it I don't think
[ANNOTATION]	B had two favourites: Hardy and Laurel.	Entailment
B	yeah
A	I've seen the whole
B	it's it's
A	movie yeah
B	it's only twenty minutes long it's just a two reeler and it's
A	yeah
B	probably the greatest twenty minutes of
B	cinema in the history of cinema it's
A	mm
B	just I daren't watch it sometimes
B	it's just like am I gonna find it this morning is it it you know
A	yeah I'll have to get that yeah
B	mm
[ANNOTATION]	The movie lasts twently minutes but it is very bad.	Contradiction
A	that they made is it's just
B	yeah
A	you know
B	well the Marx Brothers
A	I used
B	used to go on tour with all the jokes that they were gonna do in the films and they'd they'd they'd get it absolutely perfect and then they'd you know the the the ones that got the
A	yeah
B	they toured the whole production you know and then erm
B	he'd had
[ANNOTATION]	B has seen a documentary aboyt the Marx Brothers from which he learnt a lot.	Neutral
B	and Groucho Marx said the same thing he said
B	you know when he's performing
A	yeah
B	and he'd be
A	watching him in such
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Groucho Marx never performed twice in the same city.	Neutral
B	cos he's not thinking about
A	critical thinking
B	do I like this he's thinking
A	yeah
B	is
A	yeah yeah
B	is the audience
[ANNOTATION]	B particularly hated Laurel.	Contradiction
A	yeah yeah
B	used to say er is you know
A	yeah
B	is middle is middle America gonna like this?
A	yeah
B	he's just totally
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	yeah
B	oh yeah I got a email off him the other day
A	how's he doing?
B	he seems to be doing alright his his mum's deteriorating
A	oh he's so he's what? he's caring for her now or
B	yeah yeah
A	is he working?
B	I don't think so I've got to email him back I was
B	he goes yeah it's really hard but you know cos his you know my mum's deteriorating it's really hard being a carer but not as having a er but not as hard has having to put up with
B	that's
B	god knows
A	I think he's still around
B	yeah I still like him but he really I think
A	yeah
B	cos cos I mean the fact that
A	yeah you don't want that to be his like
B	yeah
A	his thought his main thought about
B	yeah
A	being here do you? it's quite sad really
B	well I dunno what would be
A	just seemed a bit I dunno
B	he's got a bit a bit of a midlife crisis and I I I sympathise with him you know
A	yeah
B	and I think he had a bit of PhD disease of
A	yeah
B	can't work like that
A	mm mm
B	that's why I'm glad I did the postdoc cos you know
A	yeah
B	you know you think you work with some other profession and you think god I know fuck all
A	well I suppose a PhD I mean you're focussed on a particular field right?
B	yeah
A	a very particular
B	yeah it's very kind of
A	thing so
B	yeah
A	anyone else speaking about their particular field is gonna be
B	yeah
A	completely outside the bounds of yours
B	yeah
B	mm
A	brain work
B	mm
A	you know as I I think I I don't know if I wanna I I'd
B	well that was my idea that's why I did film archiving cos it was
A	yeah
B	practical
A	yeah
B	but
A	yeah
B	I thought I was gonna be
B	like it's like the film Indian Jones
B	where it will be just be like wow I found it
A	yeah discovering all these like film archives with I dunno like MGM like tracking you
[ANNOTATION]	B did not have many expectations for film archiving.	Contradiction
B	what do the film companies?
A	well do you think film companies have like these old films do you think they've actually got loads of different bits of the film and every five years they just
B	no
[ANNOTATION]	Film companies usually have more than ten thousand people employed.	Neutral
A	no?
B	no not for old films ninety-five percent of silent films have gone forever
A	mm
B	they they burnt them they literally burnt them because in the old days with nitrate with the emulsion you used to get silver
A	oh
B	so they burnt them down for the silver
A	oh jesus
B	yeah but you see nobody thought it was gonna last
A	yeah
B	you know it's
A	yeah
B	admire it in a way I admire that
A	yeah
B	I mean I'm I'm an archivist on on one level I believe in it but on the other hand like yeah just burn it you know and move on but
A	yeah it's progression
[ANNOTATION]	People would burn down old films to get silver.	Entailment
B	yeah
A	I suppose but yeah it's it's only retrospect you can see those kind of things
B	but erm there's a great book called The Parade's Gone By written by a guy called Kevin Brownlow who er
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	B, as an archivist, doesn't agree that they should burn them.	Contradiction
B	and erm
B	only a guy mm and they're but
A	at
B	yeah
A	mm
B	to do er he does a talk to the film archivists
B	and he won't deal with academics he hates academics
B	which made me feel cool because I was an archivist at the time
B	I understand his point
B	cos they wanna see him
[ANNOTATION]	Mr. Brownlow is a writer.	Entailment
B	cos it's Kevin Brownlow you know
B	and erm
B	he was walking towards the archive room with this with this guy called Charles Barr who is this great cinema academic cinema historian and my mate saw him he was like walking along with him and Charles Barr said to
B	and Charles Barr goes but but
B	proving his point
B	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Sometimes it's better to follow the idea of "out with the old, in with the new".	Entailment
A	yeah
B	yeah
B	yeah?
A	in her book she can point when we say monkey she can point to the monkey
B	really?
A	and the lion and
B	yeah
A	two other animals
B	that's pretty advanced
A	say clap your hands er well no say clap your hands in Chinese I can't remember the the words but she she'd clap her hands
B	oh
B	mm
A	I know it's normal for parents to say your your kid's smart but
B	well you have two clever parents then
A	I think I think she's she is pretty smart
B	mm
A	yeah course they will be jesus that's er
B	I said with my
B	with my looks and your brains we're gonna have
B	stupid ugly kids
A	nah your kids are gonna be super smart
B	well I dunno erm
A	cos I think I think mostly it's genetic right? I mean
B	well no the you you're in into the eugenics there aren't you?
A	yeah well yeah but I do believe
B	but erm
A	in eugenics a little bit
B	that would
B	oh no it's not oh okay
B	no er cos I was talking about my old boss erm
A	mm
B	and you he should be er climbing trees he was six
A	yeah
B	should really be doing a bit more playing in
A	yeah
B	mud you know you don't wanna be to be too clever
A	that's it yeah
B	and he knew he well he knew so much about so many things
A	yeah
B	to know everything
A	yeah
B	er you know?
A	mm
B	I I don't think it was that I
A	yeah yeah I I was an observer
B	yeah
A	I used to like sitting in with like the adults and just listening to their conversations
B	yeah
A	and
B	yeah I think I wanted to be grown up
A	yeah
B	when I was quite young
A	I did yeah
B	yeah
A	I wasn't interested with like play fighting or you know all that that other stuff
A	fighting and stuff and I was just sitting in the corner just looking at them
A	I just remember I must've been about five you know?
A	though I mean she was looking at me going oh this kid's a bit weird
A	but I just felt a bit out of place you know? dunno just just I dunno
B	yeah
A	I don't wanna
B	yeah
A	but in some ways I er I was very mature for my age
B	oh everyone is
A	yeah
B	you don't realise till you get older that
A	yeah and just like socially interacting I was I was way behind like way behind sorry he's very shy very well not not shy but I just didn't want to
B	mm
A	interact I just didn't I just felt awkward
B	yeah dunno
A	it's only
B	bit of a loner but I yeah I dunno cos we
A	yeah
B	I knew the names of everybody on the street
A	yeah
B	so
A	yeah same with where I
B	it was just a sort of social
A	mm
B	sort of thing you know erm
A	yeah
B	so that was that was kind of nice
A	yeah
B	you know it was like you know nobody ever came to the front door it was always to the kitchen door
A	yeah
B	you'd just walk in
A	yeah yeah I remember that as well
B	yeah
A	till we moved
B	yeah and I moved
A	then it er it changed
A	yeah it changed
B	yeah
A	and we moved a lot of times so I think that caused
B	oh right we only moved once
A	you know like changing school
B	oh right
A	I changed school like three times or something it's
B	oh I never changed school
A	was pretty hard
B	yeah I bet it is yeah
B	mind you I hated school
A	yeah
B	still do
A	mm
B	I kind of regret it but I think I just couldn't listen couldn't concentrate
A	no I didn't like it
B	yeah
A	at that age you know you just wanna be part of something
B	mm
A	er for me it was just it was shit and I I didn't like it
B	well when I was er I mean I I barely went for the last two years and you know my mum was quite strict
A	mm
B	oh the teachers are on strike again
B	and then either that or we'd go and hang around by the canal which is
B	cos we
A	yeah
B	tut anyway
B	dunno why I guess I was just an awkward kid I regret it you know
A	yeah but er it shows though I mean look where you are now you know?
B	mm
A	important
B	mm
A	really it it's more on yourself what you consider important and your own motivations
B	yeah
A	to do things that's
B	mm
A	and yeah you're gonna pick up a few things there but
B	but I did think I was thick
A	mm
B	I really thought the reason I was in the I was the bottom class
A	mm
B	I er I honestly thought I was thick
A	mm
B	and there was
A	yeah
B	your mum's gonna say er you know
A	yeah mm
B	but I just think all my interests were in other areas I was interested
A	yeah
B	in music and books
A	yeah
B	you know
A	yeah
B	weird
B	read a lot of books and you don't think you're clever
B	but er yeah
A	nah it's it's all about reading books
B	yeah
A	I'd I'd say that's the most important thing
B	mm
A	and that's really what I'm gonna not push but I'm certainly gonna suggest
B	yeah
A	cos that er that's what widens your fucking knowledge right?
B	yeah
A	I mean we say you're going to uni what are you reading? you know?
B	yeah
A	er er it's all about
B	mm
A	going to the seminars it's about getting the books from the library and
B	yeah
A	fucking reading it and understanding it
B	this is what I don't like about academia
A	mm
B	I mean when I first started my PhD
B	and the head of the department comes past you know hi
B	reading that? how is that related to your research? it's not
A	mm
B	I'm just reading Moby Dick
B	and it's just like this sort of
A	mm
B	and then two minutes later this other lecturer came past hi
B	er why? what do you mean why am I reading Moby?
B	how can you? why would you even say that?
B	why are you reading Moby Dick? it's fucking Moby Dick that's why
B	I'm reading Moby Dick
A	yeah
B	but erm you do get a lot of I mean I it's a
A	mm
B	how can you possibly be an educator in any capacity if you you haven't got the basic general knowledge? you might know a load about
A	well that's that's what it is though now right?
B	you can't no yeah
A	it it's
B	yeah
A	doesn't matter if you don't know anything else
B	yeah
A	it's
A	right
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	she just wanted to know what erm what I'm doing for food cos we've got a bit of Thai curry left in the fridge so
A	I think she's just gonna finish that up
A	good
B	yeah I'll probably only have one or two more and then I've gotta go
A	yeah
B	cos
A	yeah could do that
B	yeah I think er you've just got to know outside your specialism
A	mm
B	you've gotta know something
A	mm mm mm
B	that's the thing but erm
A	otherwise it becomes kind of Brave New World
B	yeah but yeah and the savage
B	he knows about Shakespeare what the hell is this?
B	yeah it is that kind of thing
A	yeah yeah
B	but
A	mm
B	so people don't wanna know outside their areas basically
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B likes Shakespeare.	Neutral
B	they consider it
A	well we can only hold so much
B	er a waste of time
A	in our heads
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	All people are willing to learn more outside their field.	Contradiction
A	right? and to get ahead of everyone else
B	mm
A	you have focus so much on
B	yeah
A	one thing now
B	so you've gotta be like you've if you're gonna be an educator if you're gonna teach as well you've got to have you know an answer to some of their questions
A	yeah
B	I told you about the
A	yeah
B	what did you learn about Elvis Presley? she goes er well about how his public image changed from being you know this
B	she thought it was the Second World War
B	she was doing a PhD in post war American literature
A	oh my god
B	I said what makes you think Elvis fought in the Second World War? well didn't he? I said no
[ANNOTATION]	Sain-Marin participated in World War II	Neutral
A	yeah
B	for eighteen months in Germany
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Elvis Presley was 23 year's old when fought in war.	Neutral
B	and he made some films
B	I mean
A	jesus
B	in her history
A	yeah
B	and and this I
A	yeah that's
B	gobsmacked
A	yeah
B	to study post war when you've gotta at least know when the war was
B	nineteen fifties
[ANNOTATION]	Post war lasted for 2 years, 6 months and 8 days.	Neutral
A	fucking hell
B	she was studying Thomas Pynchon who writes about the Second World War
A	yeah it's quite worrying
B	it's that kind of just
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Thomas Pynchon won a history literature Nobel prize.	Neutral
B	I mean she was er well you know I get erm well it's not really my specialism the war
A	yeah but you know what
B	you er you could at least
A	er the dates were and
B	you could at least allow yourself to know
A	you just have to learn two dates
B	yeah
A	the start and end
A	it's not difficult
B	I mean
A	mm
B	she's like you know
A	yeah that's
B	she's a bit like
A	that's more Chinese though you know? that's kind of
B	yeah I mean cos they've got a lot more I think they grew up with grow up with a lot more pressure
A	mm
B	cos there's
A	yeah
B	you know
A	and just the the lack of
B	yeah
A	oh right oh okay
B	erm you know she's
A	yeah
B	on what she does
A	well that er as well is very Chinese as well
B	yeah
A	yeah because yeah like you said
B	yeah
A	yeah the competition
B	but I yeah but I didn't start my PhD until I was in my thirties
A	mm
B	and I think I'm a better educator for it
A	mm
B	I think I'm a better writer for it cos at least
A	mm
B	I know what was going on at the time you know
A	yeah exactly
B	mm
A	even like if I start in my forties you know? don't think that's a problem I think that's probably better like for me
B	Plato said you shouldn't study philosophy until you're over forty
A	there you go well philosophy is something I'd consider and I I think I'd be quite good at that
B	mm
A	but I don't like quoting other people's words it's one thing as well it's kind of like doing English literature where you just look at other people's works
B	mm
A	er I'd write these poems and short stories and
B	yeah mm
B	yeah
A	I mean do you just study other people's ideas or do you try and move it forward and think of your own ideas?
B	well a
A	yeah
B	scholarship forward so that
A	yeah
B	by definition you would be a
A	yeah
B	philosopher if you were doing
A	yeah
B	a PhD in philosophy
A	I suppose you need to know the past to to
B	yeah
A	to do the future but
B	yeah me too I was always good at that
A	in front of my class or whatever
B	like it breaks my heart now
A	yeah
B	cos I'm writing so much academic work
A	yeah
B	yeah I've gotta write a novel I really have
A	yeah
B	dunno if the chance has passed cos you've really gotta do that shit in your twenties haven't you?
A	yeah
B	but
A	no there's no it's there's no such thing er I think
B	yeah
A	you're move motivated to publish when you're
A	when you're in your twenties than when you're in your
A	when you're in your forties oh okay yeah
B	mm
A	that's not gonna happen
A	too late
B	yeah but I would
A	well yeah
B	you know I've got I will regret it so
A	yeah
B	whether it gets published or not
A	yeah yeah I dunno if I could write a novel
B	a novel?
A	yeah
B	oh good for her
A	couple of months she reckons she's gonna she's been working on it for about seven years or something
B	yeah?
A	yeah
B	yeah we we made friends again the other week
A	yeah?
B	not that we ever broke friends
A	yeah
B	officially
A	yeah
B	but erm you know
A	yeah it was a weird yeah was really but I don't know what it was
B	just it was the
A	yeah?
B	I think I'm just assumed I asked
A	yeah that's good
B	I always like her
A	yeah
B	that's why that's why you know it upset me a little bit that
A	yeah
B	you know
B	I think I always managed to
A	mm
B	and literature
A	yeah yeah
B	you know she's clever
A	yeah
B	and she's you know
A	mm
B	so we could always talk about er music and books and other things and movies
A	yeah
B	mm yeah
A	but I don't I didn't really see her and
B	mm
A	maybe he
B	well he always played the victim I think with
A	yeah I think
B	you know and she felt sorry for him
A	I think that's like where he might have got her
B	I mean I felt sorry for him don't get me wrong you know he but there's only so far you can go
A	yeah
A	yeah cos I mean
B	mm
A	yeah it's she's had a shit storm life but it's
B	yeah?
A	so I think when someone else comes and says oh you know I've had a hard time
B	yeah
A	you know
B	yeah no I like I did you know when and and obviously I really liked her when we first got here but she's really clever you know and really interesting to talk to and lovely
A	mm
B	she has a very lovely manner about her
A	she's
B	the way she speaks
A	she's very quiet
B	she's very lovely
A	and very
B	yeah
A	just very
B	yeah
A	yeah she's
B	mm yeah
A	she's kind of
B	yeah
A	you know? just kind of I think she was just kind of sussing everyone out
B	yeah
A	never got involved you know? and cos she's so softly spoken and things you just kind of
B	yeah
A	you know I often found that I was kind of
B	yeah yeah
[ANNOTATION]	she is friendly	Contradiction
A	I didn't value what she was saying so much because she was seemed
B	yeah
A	so distant
B	yeah
A	but after a while I realised actually
B	well I often I I often found that she was commenting on my comments on Facebook I don't really
A	no nor me
B	you know the books I was reading or you know when Lou Reed died you know it was that
A	yeah
B	it was she she's really a Lou Reed
A	yeah
B	you know sort of we had a bit of a bond over that you know
[ANNOTATION]	she is amicable	Contradiction
A	yeah
B	you know
A	ah
B	well
B	yeah
B	can I have
A	what are you doing in
B	mm
A	no you've gotta go away you've gotta take your holiday
A	no
A	right
B	so it's a big
[ANNOTATION]	everyone likes her presence	Contradiction
A	oh okay
B	it's a big thing for her
[ANNOTATION]	she is leaving soon	Neutral
A	right
B	I mean it's almost too much but I was here for a lot of I mean in
A	how much notice have you gotta give? a month is it?
B	yeah
A	so when would you
B	I think first of March
A	hypothetically
B	no first of March
[ANNOTATION]	she will leave next week	Neutral
A	first of March?
B	is it? I dunno when's
A	okay so you
B	when's New Year again?
A	I dunno
B	quite late this year I think
A	February something
B	yeah so maybe if we have to
[ANNOTATION]	she will leave tomorrow	Contradiction
A	yeah
B	yeah I mean I'm gonna be pretty the you know I'm not sure I want the job but I'm gonna be gutted if I don't get it
A	yeah
B	I mean
A	no but like you were saying before you know you you need to take that
B	mm
A	step
B	yeah
A	qualifications what you're doing now you're kind of
B	yeah
A	I mean but but you've still got a good life you're still getting paid very
B	yeah
A	good quality of life you know? but if you
B	I mean it's so
A	wanna go back to
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	that's gonna that's where it's gonna cause problems
B	so yeah the next thing is
A	yeah just do that
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	well like I say you know it's gonna take
A	yeah
B	come back from
A	yeah
B	and she's still
A	yeah
B	in her own country
A	yeah
B	which is weird
A	yeah
B	and er
A	but she liked it when you went back in the summer
B	mm
A	mm
B	this er year actually we wouldn't mind going to like a third country you know like not
A	what
B	or
unknown_female	it's where we'll go to probably for our honeymoon but erm
A	yeah this is the thing innit? I'm in the same position really I'm a bit worried about this cos my brother is emigrating in February
B	oh yeah?
A	he's moving to
B	right
A	like the day after he gets married
B	mm
A	so they've employment for this time that's their reason to get in past immigration whilst they're there they've got this other guy that they've been liaising with to change their visas into a like a long term visa
B	right
A	and then they're gonna try and set up their own businesses
B	yeah
A	erm I mean she's got her physiotherapy which I think
B	mm
A	I dunno but if it does work my mum and my brother are completely on their own and my mum's been sick now for like three
B	yeah?
A	for about three months
B	yeah
A	the rest of her family are you know disowned her like my dad won't speak to her
B	mm
A	it's it's my job you know?
B	yeah
A	and I I don't really wanna go back I know I sound like an arsehole but I don't wanna go back and look after her because a lot of it's her own doing you know?
B	mm
A	it's the drink and it's the
B	mm
A	I I that's where a lot of my energy was when I was younger was looking after my mum
B	yeah
A	she was a complete fuck up
B	yeah
A	but it's that pressure you know?
B	yeah
A	mm
B	at all you know they're both active but I kind of wanna get to know them
A	yeah
B	for a few years before they pass on or whatever
A	mm
B	and if they do ill it'll be my sister looking after them
A	mm mm
B	you know
A	how old is he?
B	my age
A	mm
B	and maybe he shouldn't be he should have died at twenty but you know
A	yeah
B	the advances they just they keep coming and coming and
A	yeah my mate's you know he must be about thirty about my age yeah
B	yeah
A	mm
B	erm
A	yeah but when you go back for those reasons you've kind of taken a part of you away
B	mm
A	in a in a selfish kind of way
B	mm
A	you have to look after someone else and you have to be in that area as well
B	yeah
A	so it kind of limits where you can live
B	yeah
A	in
B	mm
A	which therefore limits the kind of jobs you can get in
B	yeah
A	and then the the hours you work as well I mean it's
B	mm
A	but I cos my family's very dysfunctional you
B	mm
A	and I don't wanna do it but
B	yeah
A	and I love my mum
B	yeah
A	mother
B	yeah
A	yeah but I don't wanna devalue
B	yeah
A	because of that you know?
B	yeah
A	it's
B	yeah it's hard innit I mean
A	mm
B	I've always been somewhere else
A	yeah
B	ever since I was nineteen whereas my brother and sister both work
A	yeah
B	well around
A	well me too I have
B	well I suppose the age gaps means
A	yeah
A	he's off living the fucking high life in the
B	yeah
A	it was because of his mum
B	yeah and
A	and
B	and
A	as well
B	home to his mum
A	it's I think I it would be a similar thing for me
B	yeah
A	I don't know what I'd get around
B	mm
A	and do whatever I wanna do but
B	yeah
A	you know I fucking
B	yeah
A	she raised me
A	in a bad way but
B	a cack handed way yeah
A	she still did it and and there was a lot of love there for me you know?
B	yeah
A	and I can't forget that
B	yeah you can't well there was love there I mean
A	yeah there was love there
B	yeah I mean it gives you a proper basis for life you know
A	yeah
B	I mean you're you're not going
A	I mean she's given me what I've got now
B	yeah
A	really you know?
B	yeah
A	I have to give back and I have given back a lot already but
B	mm
A	and they've got a nice house
B	mm
A	they built themselves up cos they made right decisions you know?
B	mm
A	so I don't think she's got to worry about that for a while
B	yeah my parents I guess it's that I mean
A	mm
B	made but oh they made bad decisions they had
B	so but you know it they nearly all went to shit in the eighties
A	yeah
B	when my father lost his job but
A	yeah
B	luckily my grandfather had died of TB as a result of the Second World War which meant that my grandmother had a second
B	so she could help us out really
A	god bless TB eh?
B	god bless TB yeah
B	horrible way to die but it meant we didn't lose our house
A	yeah
B	but it's one of those
A	yeah
B	if you were just private you get your head blown off in the Second World War you get fuck all
A	yeah
B	I mean it's you're
A	yeah
B	I mean
B	I mean it's we lucked out but
B	it's terrible the way they treat

B	I think it was Randolph Sutton who was equally famous but
B	I don't think it was Chaplin
A	yeah
B	it's so the good story is Chaplin
