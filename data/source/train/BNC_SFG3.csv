B	are you joking me?
A	all you need is one of these
B	do they give you that?
A	and then
B	to buy it?
A	no but you could do it on your mobile phone if you had to
B	what is it three grand?
A	no it's not I mean I
B	right
A	but you don't have to buy that I mean or they say in the guidelines that you can actually use your mobile phone
B	yeah
A	like a digital recorder
B	yeah
A	a lot of people around the UK are using their phones
B	so seriously something I could do?
A	mm
A	no
B	yeah
A	nothing it's just as when you want and when you can do it and
B	mm
A	or it could be like you know
B	and so
A	that kind of thing
B	that's where I might fall down
A	no
A	no unfortunately the child must be over eighteen
A	to give consent
B	mm
A	mm
B	and you send that off to somebody who writes it all up?
A	MP3 file
B	yeah
A	and I do it in a Dropbox
B	yeah
A	there's erm
B	yeah
A	and then the only other thing you have to do is there's a recording sheet that says I was at my house
B	mm
B	mm mm
A	you put in how many minutes the conversation lasted
B	yeah
A	it's
B	mm mm
B	yeah
A	job work
B	oh right?
A	and that's it
B	I could really do with the cash
A	yeah
B	and that seems like a way I could do it without
A	yeah
B	having to go out to work
A	you don't even have to
B	details
A	I'll bring the details d'you mind?
B	no not at all
A	I met
B	yeah I know her name
A	erm
B	did she have a baby? is she curly hair?
A	mm yeah
B	curly hair
A	she had little
B	right
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	the baby has hair	Entailment
B	I think
B	oh my word
A	think so
A	mm
A	I only met them briefly for lunch yesterday but erm
B	mm
A	in Pizza Express and he loves all this kinda thing
A	like you know which
A	so she said oh is that in the Sunday school you heard that and then we
B	did she say it?
A	she said it really sincerely it was brilliant
B	oh no
A	I just said oh mum did a good job
A	and it is quite difficult to explain
B	mm
A	and but he seemed quite happy with that
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	he is grateful	Neutral
A	another round of questions another round of questions
B	is she working?
A	she is working she's at
B	okay
A	mm
B	didn't go back to
[ANNOTATION]	she is unemployed	Contradiction
A	mm
A	I mean none of us really had a good experience there did we?
B	no
A	not overly
B	really?
[ANNOTATION]	not everyone like the experience	Entailment
A	mm mm
B	what's she doing? the same thing?
A	she's
B	wow
A	cos it's a private school
B	oh okay
A	have to work Saturdays
[ANNOTATION]	the private school will have more classes on weekends	Neutral
B	mm
A	so
B	yeah
A	and then come home so
B	yeah
A	she will
B	right
B	is it in Cambridge?
A	it's in
B	oh right okay
A	mm
B	right
A	okay so she's bought it off her friend which sounds kinda nifty
B	mm
A	it all works out for her but erm
B	really?
A	yeah
B	okay has she got a partner?
A	no
B	did she must've had a something at some point
A	no
B	okay
A	yeah
B	how
A	mm
B	sperm donor
A	donor
B	right
A	mm
B	oh right really?
A	mm
B	mm
A	yeah you have to pass all these tests like and everything
B	do you?
A	psychological
B	what as a mother or?
A	psychological tests
B	do you?
B	what both parties? the guy and the woman?
B	just the woman?
A	not yeah just the woman the woman is gonna bring up the child erm
B	no
A	erm
B	remember her
A	lovely yeah
B	mm mm
B	yeah
A	and erm
B	big thing
A	I mean
B	yeah
A	thirdly you're trying to keep the full time job
B	yeah
A	and you're being emotionally bullied at the moment
B	yeah
B	really?
A	she was willing to go
B	right
A	but she got lucky on the first one
B	oh
A	these lovely looking
B	is she open about
A	yeah
B	to him as well I know he probably can't understand can he but?
A	well I wonder
B	yeah
A	mm
B	I think as long as you don't like you don't have to go into detail
A	mm
B	too much detail do you? but
A	mm
B	kids can be quite accepting and quite
A	they can be but then you know they can sort of they're
B	but I think it
A	but then lots of people might be single parents you know? I mean as in
B	no
A	or a single dad
B	but that's that's not uncommon is it? I suppose the the the bit that is different is
A	mm
B	okay
B	yeah
A	there must be some legal thing
B	yeah
A	get information
B	yeah
A	about his dad
B	yeah
A	now whether he can go and meet his dad I don't know but he can certainly get out get information like his name
B	I would imagine
A	how old he was where he lived
B	the guy can choose that can't he?
A	mm
B	that he says never or yes when they're eighteen I guess they've got that control haven't they?
A	I think he
B	yeah
A	yeah they have to disclose
B	mm
A	I suppose on the moral grounds is that
B	mm
A	otherwise what we're looking at is a bunch of kids going but
B	mm
A	where what hello?
B	yeah
A	you know what what happened to that bit you know with my dad you know why why I suppose but
B	yeah
A	but erm
A	so I get back from
A	I get back
A	first of all I didn't know she was pregnant
A	I need some help from my friends I was like
B	yeah
A	I mean
B	that's sad isn't it that you have to
A	it's different when you're away
B	mm
A	mm
B	can't
A	mm
B	erm
A	I'm not happy about it
B	no
A	but if I don't use it
B	yeah
A	no
B	but I just think it's all about validation
A	mm
B	it's all people want
A	right
B	and you see statuses and stuff and you think
A	mm
B	you know you're saying how you're feeling or
A	mm
B	something's
A	crap
B	yeah and you just think what are you
A	yeah
B	after? why d'you need
A	mm
B	twenty people to say are you alright honey?
A	mm
B	what's the matter?
A	mm
B	I mean I I dunno
A	the one that I really don't like at all erm erm is
B	right
A	secondly why don't you just tell it to my face? cos I actually missed it that day it wasn't until your uncle
A	told me that that was lovely
B	mm
B	no
A	but I really don't get why you're telling all these other people
B	yeah
A	when
B	yeah
A	with a whole bunch of people who don't even really know you? maybe some people are your friends but they're friends from years ago I mean they're only hanging about
B	yeah
A	it's easy to be on on Facebook
B	yeah
A	not like they're gonna give
B	I know
A	I mean there's really different ways of using but
B	mm
A	I dunno
B	yeah
B	of each other
A	yeah
B	look where we are look what we're doing and I just think
A	mm
B	rather than taking photos and and tweeting about it or
A	mm
B	you know putting it on Facebook or whatever
A	mm
B	just
A	yeah
B	live it
A	just because
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	and who cares and
A	yeah
A	I went to this thing on
B	oh right
A	erm
B	oh right
A	because I'm not working it basically means that I'm going to
B	no
A	yeah cos there's
B	get you
A	I know
A	it's really good for the head yeah the body I'm kinda folding up
B	mm mm
A	but this thing's called what is consciousness? so this thing this lecture I went to
B	oh
A	been in there
B	yeah
A	whichever way you wanna explain it
B	yeah
A	it is pretty instant these days I guess
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	organise yourself a bit and then within five minutes everyone could see it and they've already liked it
B	yes
A	obviously less than five minutes
B	yeah oh god seconds
A	no
B	seconds
A	yeah
B	mm mm
A	but you know what I used to do these classes about thirty years ago and that was before the advent of you know all these online mobile instant technologies
B	mm
A	but
B	yeah
A	he said now it's almost impossible to persuade
B	yeah
A	that
B	yeah
A	to live in the present
B	yeah
A	most people go forget that idea
B	yeah
A	that's just a rubbish idea
B	it's sad I find it quite sad
A	I suppose when you have kids though it does help to channel the present a lot more because you're attending
B	mm
A	you know
B	mm
A	the good moments you know it's really obviously really really aesthetic
B	yeah
A	what's going on
B	yeah
A	you
B	yeah
B	mm
A	you do quite worry about the future in terms of
B	yeah
A	what your kids are gonna you know?
B	yeah
A	but
B	yeah
A	but and I guess as they get older they
B	yeah
A	you know dunno
B	mm
A	and then he said there's other times it's like an elastic band like
B	yeah
A	making you in the present
B	yeah
A	there's like almost nothing you can do about it
B	yeah
A	you know it's just really full on
B	mm
A	and then you get into the or the past or the future
B	yeah
A	you know this sort of thing
B	yeah
A	I hardly ever really talk to people about it it's not one of those conversations that
B	it's not though is it that you?
A	no
B	it's kinda deep isn't it?
A	yeah
B	mm
A	to me oh for you and
A	you know what?
B	what does that make me?
A	I don't know
B	yeah
A	I'm just taking it as
B	therapy
A	its face value
B	therapy
A	but it's like
B	yeah
A	so being in no man's land
B	don't you think that'll make a difference if you crave your past though? you know
B	yeah
A	gosh
B	bitter about things
A	oh gosh
A	even this guy
B	I'm not checking Facebook I'm just
A	yeah
A	ketchup
A	but erm so
A	he was saying that he said
B	right
A	and erm
B	yeah
A	but but why? I mean firstly I'm not that type of person secondly I didn't know you all that well which
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	cos we knew each other that was it
B	yeah
A	and erm and I said but
B	and them
A	thank you
B	thank you
A	you know if you've got nothing else to go on
unknown_female	would you like anything else?
B	no I'm fine thank you
unknown_female	dessert coffee?
A	I was like well I suppose I
B	yeah
A	you know I dunno I I just thought that was quite a a pointed way of looking at life but he can be a bit into that
B	yeah
A	mm
B	I mean there's times when I miss stuff that I used to know but then I think do I really? do I really?
A	yeah
B	you
A	yeah
B	kind of have this rose tinted view don't you like?
A	yeah
B	what things were like
A	yeah
B	I dunno
A	but what sort of things do you miss then?
B	my social life?
A	yeah
B	and that's not just about having children because it it changed when I left my husband really
A	yeah
B	it's that big social group that we had
A	yeah
B	and that's what I think I hate about Facebook as well is still seeing that going on and I'm not part of that
A	yeah
B	I think that is part of the problem
A	yeah
B	but I don't think I'd want to be
A	no
B	now
A	no
B	but when you're sitting at home cos you can't go out cos
A	yeah
B	yeah
B	mm
A	mm
B	erm
A	good
B	well yeah
A	I know I've
A	I mean I'm not saying it like that but it's really good that it is you know it's like
B	no
A	could could've easily just sort of
B	well
A	nose dived
B	there was times when I felt I can't do it
A	yeah
B	particularly the last few months cos
A	has she not?
B	a nightmare the first six months
A	oh no
B	she was just awake screaming for hours
B	so that took its toll
A	yeah
B	there were times when I was
B	like for a good few months
A	no
B	I can't even function
A	yeah
B	I can't get dressed
A	yeah
B	I can't you know do the basic things that is like I need to probably put it aside and
A	yeah
B	in a year's time everything will be different again
A	yeah exactly
B	and I probably won't be able to get it back
A	yeah exactly
B	erm
A	good
B	I can start to think it's amazing how it affects you
A	yeah
B	I have
A	yeah
B	never been so tired
A	yeah
B	in my life
A	it's real sleep deprivation isn't it?
B	ah it's torture
A	it's just it is torture
B	they use it don't they as?
A	yeah
B	torture it is
A	yeah
B	just horrific
A	god
B	yeah so kind of coming through that phase
A	yeah thank god
B	I feel a little bit more erm
A	yeah
B	positive about stuff a bit more motivated to do things
A	mm
B	but then you know I've got ideas but it doesn't happen
A	yeah
B	because there's nobody to do it
A	how d'you mean there's nobody to do it?
B	well we've got
A	what what happened to your supporters like the people around you who? what happened?
A	did they?
B	no no they're still there I mean
A	yeah
B	there's a group of trustees they're probably I think there's five of us
A	yeah
B	and everyone's very committed and like we'll meet every maybe two or three months
A	mm
B	and we
A	mm
B	come up with lots of ideas
A	ah
B	everyone's working full time
A	yeah
B	for a
A	yeah cos I remember you talking about that the last time
B	yeah that kinda thing though
A	that that sort of idea
B	just a few months to do certain bits of work
A	mm
B	and she was amazing
A	uhu
B	what's she called now? she's something in erm
A	erm
B	I think it was psychology though but criminal psychology
A	okay
B	that was it
A	yeah
B	I'm sure it was that
A	mm
B	wanted wanted to travel wanted to do all these things and we kind of started the ball rolling and then she got a job
B	no
A	I know just
B	oh no this is no
A	no it's all gone now
B	gone now
A	and then so since?
B	just
A	no cos you can kind of
B	dunno what we can do really
A	yeah
B	I can't I haven't got any time
A	it's yeah you
B	and any time that I had I'd be going to bed
A	yeah of course
A	no I mean you no you'd probably be able to think about it in small snippets of time but
B	so
A	to be able to
B	there's so many things we could do it's like
A	yeah
B	at the moment it's it's still there and it's ticking over
A	mm
B	erm
A	wow
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	I've got a
A	yeah
B	a couple of people are doing
A	that's really good
B	erm
A	that's really good so you're still doing the jewellery so you're still finding time
B	yeah
A	to do that
B	fucking earrings
B	no shouldn't be negative about it it's all great
B	what else?
B	er
A	yeah
B	last year
A	oh wow
B	that was good
A	yeah
B	and the woman who did that has just said that she's gonna do this
A	yeah
B	but she just text me today to say she's got a friend who is erm an Italian chef
A	right
B	who's willing to come to
A	yeah but people love that sorta stuff though don't they?
B	well yeah I mean
A	they just love it
B	she's got a book coming out
A	they love it
B	and then
A	I it's not my thing myself but
B	no me neither
A	but but doesn't mean to say that it isn't popular cos it pretty much is
B	yeah
A	you know?
B	I mean somebody a chef who is
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	so she's hopeful we could get sort of forty fifty people
A	I reckon
B	it's worth a go
A	I know it's a good idea yeah I think people really love that sort of thing
B	it's trying to find different things that it's kind of interesting but without too much work
A	as well
B	I'm not into a
A	yeah
A	where did she
B	at the village college in
A	yeah yeah
B	erm
A	so how many people did you get in there?
B	it wasn't loads I think about thirty
A	but he did a quite a few hours?
B	er
A	like as a over
B	it was a three hour thing
A	right okay
B	I think we
A	mm mm
B	erm
A	yeah
B	you know couple a few hundred
A	yeah you go
B	but
A	mm
B	not get two hundred quid
A	no I know but it's
B	but it's not worth my time sometimes
A	yeah
B	that sounds terrible
A	yeah
B	I don't mean it that way
A	well no cos you're looking at the bigger picture
B	I'd rather something for eight nine hundred pounds sort of thing
A	well yeah but you are looking at the bigger picture
B	I
A	you also know what the situation is out there
B	yeah
A	it so therefore you know though you know how much money you really need
B	yeah
A	you know?
B	I've
A	oh no
B	so
A	dear
B	might need a whole bottle
B	er
A	yeah
B	and then it and then her
A	yeah
B	she's erm
A	okay
B	so we
A	nice
B	and we were talking about like Youtube and how popular little video clips are and
A	mm
B	she was talking about somebody she knew who
A	mm
B	just factual
A	yeah
B	and it was just amazing just something like thirty second clips
A	yeah
B	erm so on Youtube on Twitter and places
A	yeah
B	all the
A	yeah
B	usual
A	yeah
B	we're gonna do a little video
A	yeah
B	and it
[ANNOTATION]	Someone is looking forward to making a video.	Neutral
A	yeah
B	hold a card and
A	yeah
B	say what they've done
A	yeah exactly yeah
B	and erm
A	yeah
B	I erm emailed him to ask if I could use one of his
A	yeah
B	and I thought it was gonna be a piece of cake
A	yeah
B	and he said yes fine no problem
A	yeah wrapped up in
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B finished making the video.	Neutral
B	from
A	sort of
B	like can erm can you give us a link to the video? I was like oh shit I haven't done it yet
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B can provide a link to the video.	Contradiction
B	erm cos they want to be able to authorise it so I don't get sued and
A	yeah that's right yeah
B	I didn't even know I just
A	yeah
B	thought he'd say it's fine use it
A	yeah
B	how naïve am I?
A	yeah cos there's so many levels of
[ANNOTATION]	The people speaker B is working with are not concerned with authorization.	Contradiction
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	so I have to do a video of
A	yeah that's great so it gives you the impetus to do it as well
B	yeah
A	so that's wonderful
B	yeah but erm
A	so you gonna do like a thirty second thing? cos the song's gonna be longer
B	yeah no erm
A	or it's just gonna be a bit of the song
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B still needs to create a video.	Entailment
A	just
B	erm
A	mm
B	people just hold a card
A	yeah
B	which has got written on there what they've done
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	The song being used with the video will be less than thirty seconds.	Contradiction
B	so somebody's done so somebody's done a triathlon somebody
A	yeah
B	like jived in the Zumbathon
A	yeah
B	or somebody's hosted a raffle party
A	yeah
B	or
A	yeah
B	anything
A	yeah
B	that people've done recently
A	yeah
B	plus photos of the children
A	of the kids yeah
B	no that's
A	but is the song quite
B	but
A	yeah yeah
B	that's the one that
A	okay
A	yeah
B	and it's used on so many things
A	yeah that's
B	and it gets so many hits
A	people really like it yeah
B	which is why I went for that cos it's
A	yeah
B	I did look at some of his others that
A	yeah
B	aren't so popular and I
A	yeah
B	I think it's about
A	they'd love it yeah exactly
B	they'll get that basically as well
A	see that is true
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	I mean fourteen million hits
A	yeah
B	what does
A	he's spent
B	what is he doing now?
A	he is a connoisseur of the internet that's what I call him because he has
B	yeah
B	I remember you saying
A	because his mum was on her deathbed but she didn't pass away and she's still alive
B	oh wow
A	erm but it was touch and go and then erm
A	I'm just gonna go to the beach
B	oh
A	so yeah since then he's done everything and anything
B	right
A	he's
A	so I go just give me the
A	and some of the stuff he does get
B	right
A	published books now
B	really?
A	yeah
A	I wrote a book
B	you just wrote a book?
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b wrote a romantic novel	Neutral
A	no like
A	hang hang on I'll qualify that
A	it's not a
B	yeah
A	change of lifestyle
B	mm
A	because there are parameters
B	yeah
A	within your life
B	it's normally money isn't it?
B	mm
A	and I was getting pissed off cos I've been doing my masters in education which I've just finished
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a has written a book	Entailment
B	right
A	and erm he erm
B	mm
A	it's all academic stuff that
B	yeah yeah
B	yeah
A	all that much so
A	small talk?
A	he goes yeah but think about it you'd be really good at that
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a is not studying	Contradiction
A	and anything I know about small talk I got from my granny
B	yeah
A	so I was thinking
A	I did sixteen thousand words
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a learned from their grandmother	Entailment
B	oh my god
A	with links to little Youtube videos about
B	really?
A	there's this one about those two guys who are really really famous erm comedians but they're they're more modern than like you know erm
B	right
A	right
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b also studied a master's degree	Neutral
A	I've got twenty-five reviews
B	really?
A	like twenty-three of them five stars
B	wow
A	one of them's four stars and the other one's two and a half stars and he just said oh I just didn't have the heart to finish it which is sort of like fair enough least he was honest
B	yeah
A	but still it's at number one in that category and number five in that
A	is you put quite a big thing
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a got most reviews with five stars	Entailment
B	yeah
A	but then through a sort of Amazon marketing thing which is what
B	oh really?
A	he's made little tweets
A	who's got a lovely sexy voice
A	so it's like that's just a little project
B	wow
A	and it really doesn't take much money and it doesn't take much
B	no
A	it does take time
B	time
A	but not as much time as one would imagine
B	yeah
A	but if you've got like a little team of people
B	yeah
A	they're all just tasked with their little things
B	mm
A	social media
B	yeah
A	he knows all these people now as well
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	they're either trying to get their businesses off the ground or they're trying to do stuff for charities or doing this and this and this
B	a minute
A	a minute okay
B	maybe a bit more yeah
A	through this song
B	yeah
A	really well known
B	yeah
A	what would you do? you know and maybe he'll come up with some ideas cos I sort of know what you mean it's kinda like it makes me think of that erm
B	I've not seen it
A	that one
B	not seen it
A	I'm pretty sure it is U2
B	right
A	it's very fluid but
B	right
A	and the cards have got smile face caricature
B	okay
A	it's quite interesting it's always changing
B	yeah
A	erm
B	yeah
A	because it's Chasing Cars
B	mm
A	you could sort of make some dynamic movement in it which is like kind of made me think of that U2 where there's
B	yeah
A	they're on the back of a car
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	it's changing
B	ah yeah
A	cos like I'm
A	yeah
B	Twitter
A	oh I know
B	numerous times a day
A	I know
B	but what I have nothing to tweet about I don't know what to put
A	no
B	if you're famous people wanna know what you've had for breakfast
A	yeah
B	but when you're not
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	right
A	so
B	mm

A	so that does get people
B	yeah
A	clicking through
B	yeah

B	latte?
A	yeah that's great
B	I'm fine thank you
A	he said to me
A	you don't know anything
B	that's true
A	you don't know anything about them
A	my heart's really going out to these people
B	mm
A	you know you have that mindset that you don't want to exclude
B	yeah
A	and it's true the way I've written it I I really really worked hard to make this not a gender specific thing
B	yeah
A	or a you know I'm really really I spent I spent most of the time just going oh I want this to
B	yeah
A	if a if a fifteen year old picked it up
B	yeah
A	to a fifty year old who
B	mm
A	I'm like
A	and it was like I didn't even I didn't even see that in what I'd written you know? and erm
B	yeah
A	I can't
B	no
A	I can't expect things from them
B	yeah
A	well you can talk to your neighbour or you can talk to your friend but maybe but
B	mm
A	or d'you know what I mean?
B	mm
A	I just don't know
B	mm
A	I know I have I've said it from the beginning and I was like we all wanna know about
A	I just remember you go like not about me
B	still not about me
A	and you're like going no no no no
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	people who support
B	well
A	yeah
B	it's not necessarily about them
A	yeah
B	I just needed to be able to make a video
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	you know there's I suppose the thing is is that
B	yeah
A	guy I think I know that guy who you mean
B	mm
A	you gotta download things
B	yeah
A	he he like had this like
B	mm
A	there's something on Youtube
B	yeah
A	you know something maybe on
B	no
A	he put he put
B	you got what?
B	okay
B	right
A	and
B	okay
A	and just one night we'd had a few drinks he was like alright
A	it's still
A	but erm
A	was on a subject that seems a bit weird
A	we feel like we're getting spam
A	we don't know who
A	and then they were like oh right
A	and went like that
B	no
A	because it confuses our friends
B	down
A	people's throats you know? well we're not pushing it down people's throats we're just asking for a favour
B	yeah
A	that's not the sort of favour that I wanna actually ask anyone
B	no
A	said oh why not? I just said because I just wouldn't do it
B	yeah
B	yeah
B	no
A	it doesn't get you where you wanna be
B	yeah
A	it's what people want you know they
B	mm
A	where's this come from? why is there?
A	what's it doing? you've got those you did your newsletters
B	yeah
A	you've got all of the stuff about how it all started
B	mm
A	quite a long time
B	yeah
A	to show people that this isn't just a flash in the pan
B	yeah
A	cos of the work it's doing
B	and it
A	right
B	and they've gone bust
A	they've got what?
B	they've gone bust
A	why?
B	cos they're questioning where that money's gone
A	where does it come from the money?
B	the people the public
A	from a national?
B	from text Santa
B	and you donate
A	alright
B	like five pounds there was a thing on TV at Christmas time
A	seven hundred grand?
B	and now they're they're having to
A	yeah like erm
A	yeah yeah
A	investigated
B	they're being investigated
A	yeah
B	so I think people have lost a lot of faith in these big charities cos you kinda question
A	yeah
B	have a charity that nobody knows
A	yeah
B	this
A	yeah
B	people don't they'll always put their
A	yeah
B	faith in it but
A	to give money
B	and make a difference
A	yeah
B	and know that it's going
A	yeah
B	directly to
A	yeah
B	and it's not getting lost in you know other costs so
A	do any small charities erm?
B	yeah
A	you know a local charity or international charity
B	mm
A	erm
B	yeah
A	and to
B	yeah
A	erm
B	yeah
A	in a way I have contact with the
B	yeah
A	individual
B	yeah
A	so that kind of means that I get
B	yeah
A	are pretty much always student
A	woo
B	yeah okay
A	so I wonder if there is like thematically
B	mm
A	yeah you've got supporters and trustees but
B	mm
A	this is just me thinking off the top of my head
B	mm
A	but these two kind of combine their thoughts their ideas
B	mm
A	and I don't mean it in a blah blah community
B	yeah
A	kinda way
B	mm
A	like if you've just a one man if you're just one person who only ever gives money to erm
B	yes
A	apparently anyway
B	we don't
A	yeah
B	we can't
A	you can't
B	but why
A	well
B	I'm trying to say well I I know what I would do
A	yeah
A	well this is why I think erm I
B	mm
A	part of the idea is that you know I know I know how
B	but if you
A	yeah
B	and you were looking to support something
A	well I know why
A	gobsmacked and they go huh huh I'm really jealous
A	oh I would never do anything like that not ever in a month of Sundays
A	huh huh
A	like this and I said course you could do it if you really wanted to do it if you really wanted to do it of course you could do it you could do anything you want in your
B	yeah
A	with your life you're privileged you've got money you can do this you've got
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	but I could easily stay here for six months and do a job you know
B	yeah
A	it's like
B	no
A	know exactly how it was gonna be
B	no
A	was gonna happen
B	yeah
A	then when it did and took off
B	mm
A	a kind of make believe world where they might think mm if I was a slightly different person
A	I could be like her
B	mm
A	but I know I'm never gonna be like her
B	yeah
A	move that into their own lives though there may be very tenuous
B	yeah
A	connection they're something like going oh so I went to
B	mm
A	you were like yeah you did you see
A	but you know it doesn't mean that
B	yeah
A	there's some kind of hook there's some kind of link
B	yeah
A	almost it's so massive
B	yeah
A	even if you think about it from what Oxfam are trying to achieve
B	yeah
A	but even then you're a bit bombarded with the whole massive like world scale problem of
B	yeah
A	famine and X
B	yeah
A	Y and Z
B	mm
A	cos you couldn't obviously take on the whole of Ecuador
A	but
B	yeah
A	this is how people are starting to try and answer some questions
B	yeah
A	and this is the type of work that is actually going round you know trying to answer these problems
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	know anything about it
B	no
A	you were like going
B	yeah
A	and this is what we're doing about it
B	yeah
A	and this is some of the results that we're getting
B	yeah
A	as in
B	yeah
A	message message boring boring
B	mm
A	I'm thinking about that fifty quid
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	mm
A	you wanna put your hand up and volunteer and say I can help you solve a problem that's up to you but
B	mm
A	at least you're saying I'm putting my fifty quid down because
B	mm
A	good
B	yeah
A	fifty quid there you go done five quid done
B	yeah
A	oh your heart strings
B	yeah
A	and I hate the way they go
B	mm
B	but that's
A	do people say that?
B	yeah
A	and d'you know how to answer that question yet?
B	erm
A	truthfully cos I think sometimes I wonder how much Oxfam lies about that or the other big ones
B	yeah
A	okay they can say it's ten pounds
B	yeah
A	if this is almost a it's a never ending circle of a of
B	yeah
A	cos prices change as well
B	does anybody think about that deeply? I think I can say to people okay your ten pounds a month will
A	yeah
B	pay for
A	yeah
B	day
A	yeah
B	that's just
A	yeah
B	an example
A	yeah
B	they wouldn't
A	no they wouldn't
B	yeah
A	and I'm having a pop at the bigger charities
B	yeah
A	but I do actually fundamentally ask the question why do we need to know
B	mm
A	is it because I'm sitting there actually having my coffee and going
B	but
A	three pounds fifty I'm gonna get
B	don't you think that turn it on its head and people would see that
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	you've perceived you've sensed it you've touched it
B	yeah
A	you've talked to those parents you've talked to those children this is real for you
B	yeah but that's part of the problem though
A	yeah
B	other people haven't had that
A	yeah
B	I I don't think you can ever
A	but but you're experiencing that you've been able to articulate
B	mm
A	to answer it
B	no
A	know what the problem is and even how to answer it
B	mm
A	what I'd like to believe is that people probably do have three levels
B	uhu
A	another is probably
B	yeah
A	and probably the third one is about integrity it's the integrity of the charity
B	mm
A	and what it stands for
B	yeah
A	which still probably comes round to the logic of
B	yeah
A	and how are we answering it and what are the problems about trying to answer this problem?
B	yeah
A	you know question
B	mm
A	one of those
B	yeah
A	not two
B	yeah
A	but those people can just go
B	yeah
A	half an hour but I'm still gonna go and buy coffee
B	yeah
A	I mean those sort of people I I don't really understand because again
B	mm
A	but that doesn't mean to say they're not valuable because they are
B	yeah
A	cos they will get
B	yeah
A	the argument
B	yeah
A	the integrity of er of the charity
B	mm
B	but no you need to
A	well
B	mm
A	you could actually have a little charity
B	right
A	that
A	no no no
A	but no but you get the person to if they if they're interested
unknown_female	oop
A	you could ask the ask the person
B	mm
A	appeals to a younger
B	yeah
A	you just put it
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a often does charity work	Neutral
A	it's incredible
B	yeah
A	appeal to it
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b is going to do what speaker a says	Neutral
B	mm
A	when you make a video anyway you still need an editor
B	yeah
A	regardless
B	yeah
A	and most editors do know about animation you know they would know how to put that on top of the white card you know? you'd need somebody who
B	yeah
A	but you know maybe that's somebody that you know maybe somebody who could volunteer to do that
B	mm
A	you know you're not asking a lot from an editor you're you know you're talking about a few people perhaps
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b knows a good video editor	Neutral
B	no
A	but I'm just thinking about some way to
B	yeah
A	have a little dynamic colour sense to it
B	Zumbathon yeah
A	you can imagine that in animation
B	yeah
A	you know little stick men women
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	you know
B	it's a really good idea
A	mm
B	mm
A	but
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a enjoys watching videos	Neutral
B	yeah
A	you know
B	yeah
A	the ones that really
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b thinks speaker a's ideas are shitty	Contradiction
B	yeah
A	you know? so
B	obviously I'm reluctant
A	no
B	but
A	you do
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b wants to make a music video	Neutral
B	yeah
A	kick it into into touch a little bit more and
B	yeah
A	to people
B	yeah
A	I think people can engage with that
B	mm
A	type of video
B	yeah
A	it would have
B	yeah
A	that sorta thing
B	yeah
B	mm
A	but me I'd like to do that one
B	yeah
A	and you know discuss your ideas or whatever
B	another good idea
A	dunno
A	had a glass of wine a coffee now so
A	kinda reached my peak there er
B	no your peak's a lot higher than mine trust me
B	it's
A	yeah
B	I do have to get cracking though
A	why d'you feel like you have to get cracking?
B	just because of
A	yeah
A	it is
B	get people
A	yeah
B	unfortunately
A	yeah
B	that's true
A	yeah
B	erm
A	that you could kinda ride the connection between video and
B	yeah
A	cos I want people to see if it resonates with people
B	yeah
A	I wanna see people pick up on it
B	mm
A	too
B	yeah
A	yeah sounds like a lotta hard work
B	it does
B	a really good idea and
A	yeah
B	you can get carried away and there's so many things I've gotta do but
A	yeah
B	and I just think
A	gotta just pick one
B	can't do it
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	I can do that
A	yeah
B	so maybe it's a pretty poor attempt but
A	yeah
B	if it doesn't look too amateurish then it's a start
A	well what music
B	yeah
A	then
B	yeah
A	of the thing's gonna look like
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	mm
A	she's not
B	no
A	so
B	yeah
A	gonna go a long way
B	yeah
A	it's gonna go a long long way
B	mm
A	so in a way maybe it is maybe it is more about that maybe it's more about that
B	yeah
A	d'you know anyone who's got that kind of editing technical kind of skills?
B	well
A	yeah
B	erm
A	yeah
B	he did he's in a band and I think he did a lot of videos for them so
B	yeah
A	oh
B	yeah
A	that will take me a couple of hours
B	yeah
A	but for me to put it together and just put it to the right parts of the lyrics and so on
B	yeah
A	I mean
B	mm
A	really
A	they've even got an app now right where you can get just any old bits of video from the phone
B	really?
A	and it makes it into a proper professional looking Youtube video
B	oh cos Facebook did something like that didn't they?
A	yeah
B	they take all your photos
A	yeah
B	and
A	it's amazing
B	mm
A	it's amazing what these things can do I mean it's just
B	mm
A	you know the level of professionalism of just being
B	yeah
A	to look good
B	yeah
A	so imagine you know if you've got that app
B	mm
A	but
B	yeah
A	there to use
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	no no that's it
A	you don't want to spend hours
B	no
A	going through it
B	yeah
A	you know? well I'll certainly ask
B	yeah it'd be interesting to see what his thoughts are
A	yeah
B	when you're in it you can't always
A	yeah it is good to get people's
B	you know see what they should be doing you know?
A	yeah
B	that'd be cool erm
A	so wasn't there somebody who was out there for a little while though er wasn't there someone?
A	no
B	that was recently
A	that was recently
B	there was erm
A	that's it
B	was that it?
A	yeah
B	yeah fine
A	I mean that
B	yeah actually
A	yeah
B	and then went out to the village and spent some time teaching
A	did she?
B	so she did some stuff in the schools
A	yeah
B	she was just teaching English
A	wow
B	having fun
A	yeah
B	she had a great time so
A	good
B	I'd love to go again
A	yeah
B	I need to go at some point
A	yeah I bet you will
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	not until they're maybe I could take them till they're ten
A	yeah
B	isn't it sound really posh but
A	no I'd like that
B	bit of a snob
A	I I
B	they'd get ill they'd if I went now they'd get ill
A	yeah
B	I don't know how people do it
A	I don't know how people do it actually
B	no
A	that's not worth it
B	I mean
A	my child's life
B	just a simple thing about travelling
A	yeah
B	from the airport to the wherever you're going or
A	god
B	so why would I then put my child in that position?
A	no
B	there's no car seats there's no prams there's nothing
A	no
B	it's just the simple things yeah
A	yeah
B	I can choose
A	and that's the thing so you've got a
B	yeah
A	what it's like you you people have no idea
B	mm
A	I've probably haven't been anywhere quite like that before
B	mm
A	so
B	yeah
A	but I mean
B	yeah
A	yeah so
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah one day though
A	yeah one day
B	when they're old when they're old enough to understand it as well I want them to to really know what it's all about
A	well this is it
B	where's the beach where's the arcade machines?
B	no it's not gonna happen
A	well that's right when they're all glued to their whatever it will be in a few years' time
B	yeah
A	and you're not gonna bring any well you can
B	yeah
A	but you can take your photos and videos and
B	when you're banging on about getting the latest
A	yeah the latest
B	train and everything
A	yeah exactly
B	yeah
A	it's good actually to have that up your sleeve
B	yeah
A	it is really good
B	yeah I don't think a lot of kids realise what it's like for other people today
A	yeah
B	gonna tell him that he's gonna give them to other children who haven't got any
A	yeah
B	that he's gonna give his toys away I said yes he can
A	yeah
B	he's not just gonna get an endless supply of toys and
A	no
B	not know the the value of them
A	yeah
B	or know that other people don't have any
A	it's
B	I dunno
A	no I don't think you are
B	not asking him to give away his favourite toy
A	no god no no
B	if it was one little action man or one little animal
A	no
B	anything
A	yeah
B	the principle of it
A	yeah
A	I think that's good
B	yeah
A	quite an early age but
B	it's not harmful is it?
A	mm better to have a concept of what that might mean now than to go oh at thirteen I can't have this this this this this this this this
B	yeah
A	well
B	yeah
A	it's like if you get started early they can kind of
B	yeah
A	get a bit of a better idea I would've thought but erm
B	well exactly
A	in England you look at them
B	I know it's it is ridiculous
A	completely
B	and you don't
A	they were second hand
B	we honestly car boots it's
A	yeah
B	amazing what you
A	yeah
B	can get everything they've got is from car boots
A	yeah
B	and why would pay forty quid for something that you could get for two pounds?
A	don't get it
B	just cos somebody else has used it first
A	just making these toy
B	yeah
A	it's a bit odd
B	yeah
A	got erm
B	yeah
A	but their friends do
B	yeah
A	and you know always think there's kinda like
B	mm
A	and of course the single one or the one who hasn't got any kids goes why do they let them get away with it?
A	I was like well I think that's probably the reason why
B	yeah
A	it's incredibly hard to manage
B	yeah
A	you know I don't think any parent really
B	no
A	I might not even agree with it
B	yeah
A	and how much marketing there is
B	yeah even on Cbeebies right
A	yeah
B	I can't live without Cbeebies like
A	yeah
B	but actually
A	oh
B	and all the ones that you can buy the
A	yeah
B	you know paraphernalia for he
A	yeah
B	likes random programmes but
B	they are they're most bizarre they they don't even talk they're just animals
B	but actually I can sit and watch those don't drive me nuts
A	yeah
B	and how it draws kids in and
B	that kinda thing I would like be devastated
A	no I know
B	they wanna fit in don't they?
A	yeah
B	they wanna be like their mates
A	yeah
B	and if they're not
A	yeah
B	then they're seen as
A	I know
B	those qualities are
A	yeah
B	they like to see that somebody's a bit different and doesn't
A	yeah
B	follow the crowd
A	that's right
B	when you're eight
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	cos
A	has he not?
B	he's had chocolate
A	mm
B	but we went round
A	right
B	and lollipops like hard boiled lollipops
A	yeah
B	and
A	managed to? yeah
B	it wasn't it wasn't like intentional particularly
A	yeah
B	I just thought it it's not good for him I don't want him to eat those
A	yeah
B	and it wasn't like
A	yeah
B	as you you know it's my choice
A	yeah exactly
B	so when
A	yeah
B	people say
A	mm
B	yeah but he's never had sweets
A	mm
B	even now when
A	so it
B	no I wouldn't let him have it
A	he didn't? no
B	I said to
A	yeah
B	but I felt terrible telling her that it's like
A	yeah
B	I was
A	did she get the did she get the hump?
B	no she wasn't too bad
A	she didn't
B	no I don't think so
A	but she mighta gone to bed that night going crikey I'm a really
B	yeah
A	bad mum because
B	I know
A	I've let my little one have
B	yeah
A	god
B	yeah I I think it's gonna get a lot harder isn't it?
A	I
B	yeah
A	he's actually working on a program at the
B	yeah
A	so they can have their mobile or whatever device
B	yeah
A	but my gosh it makes sense
B	yeah
A	if your child's eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen you know up to a point
B	yeah
A	just not get round what that is
B	yeah
A	or I did read something
B	yeah
A	I do wanna talk to you about it
B	yeah
A	there's nothing worse than going to bed or
B	yeah
A	and being kind of freaked out
B	yeah
A	so he's working on it apparently there isn't anything to this day
B	mm
A	in the world that actually does what he thinks it should do
B	yeah
A	there are sort of censorships
A	on your TV on your computer settings
B	why did you not do that on the device they've been looking on? why could you not look at their phone? or look at
A	yeah
B	d'you know what I mean? you can look at the history of what they've been looking at on the internet can't you? and
A	you can
B	but I guess as a parent it's not
B	no you can
A	no? sorta like er having a diary or something that's kind of
B	if my eight year old not that my eight year old would
A	no
B	have a phone but if they did that's not theirs
A	yeah it's yours you've given it to them
B	I'm paying for it
A	yeah
B	I dunno I dunno
A	yeah
B	I mean my nieces are
A	mm
B	it's in her hands
A	mm
B	at twelve
A	so what age d'you think? it's hard to say isn't it? because in those years
B	I don't know
A	it's really hard that one
B	the one positive thing is that I know
A	yeah
B	and he would be able to
A	yeah
B	at the moment but that's probably that all that can change too
A	yeah
B	but they might've chipped children by then that's what I'm hoping
B	so I know exactly where they are
B	beeps across the screen
B	it's a minefield it really is
B	yeah
A	you know?
B	yeah
A	I don't know whether that is actually possible it probably is
B	yeah
A	where they can have quite a minimal kind of like erm supervision
B	yeah
A	of their child's devices
B	yeah
A	or there could be real reason why
B	yeah
A	like oh wow I hope he's alright or what's he actually been doing now or what's he getting into?
B	did you see that programme erm I can't remember his name now
A	god no you see this all
B	no this is really
A	oh
B	well it's only
A	like
B	come to my attention recently
A	okay
B	maybe last month I've heard about him
A	right no I don't know anything about him
B	I think he's been doing it for a while but basically he goes online pretends to be a young girl on these chat rooms or just generally out there in the internet
B	he but is saying that I'm only thirteen
A	god
B	it was a documentary not very not long ago
A	what's it called? I'd like to see it
B	The Paedophile Hunter
A	The Paedophile Hunter
B	I think
A	so
B	Stinson I'm sure it's Stinson Hunter his name
A	Stimpson Hunter
B	you'll find it
A	okay
B	you'll find it it's really popular
A	Paedophile Hunter
B	erm
B	kind of a bit of like
A	was it American or British?
B	no he's English
A	oh okay
B	but I think he's a guy that's had a er really difficult upbringing
A	okay
B	erm
A	yeah
B	fuck off is it fair what ethics?
A	yeah
B	that guy is intentionally going on there
A	he's dealing with people who who don't have ethics anyway
B	does it matter that you are right? I don't know
A	that's right
B	but it's just incredible the the guy's reaction when they came through the door
A	yeah
B	well I'll she was eighteen she said she was eighteen no I wrote it
A	but geographically how do these people even meet? these young
B	he
A	but these men
B	mm
A	people in real life
B	yeah
A	I would've thought that they're just getting some fantasy out of it and that you know
B	they actually want to meet them
A	they actually want to meet them
B	they turned up at the guy's
A	and actually they wanna actually sexually abuse them?
B	yeah
A	oh god
B	amazing
A	but how does the twelve year old get there if she can't drive herself?
B	no no they come to her
A	so her mum is out the house?
B	so
A	have they got no concept of the fact that their
B	don't even think about it
A	oh god that's yeah
B	oh yeah
A	I think something like that
B	yeah
A	erm
B	from Surrey weren't they?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	because that's entrapment yeah it is you're definitely setting out with an intention to
B	yeah
A	then harm them yeah
B	yeah
A	so you are you're probably thinking about all the cleverest things that you can
B	mm
A	at some point it's a probably isn't it that?
B	yeah
A	mm
B	I just thought he's he's doing an amazing thing really
A	yeah there should be more like him
B	he's put his life in danger he's been run over he's been all sorts of stuff yeah you should you should have a look
A	oh
B	yeah
A	god I mean I'm
B	mm
A	sort of documentary for me
B	yeah
A	you know how you how you do that
B	yeah
A	but at least he's got
B	well this is it you know? there was a lot of argument about why the police aren't working with him or why you know they're not
A	why aren't they using his methodology?
B	why? why is it yeah? why's this not happening?
A	yeah
B	and they do they say they do that kind of thing but
A	yeah
B	they don't have the manpower
A	that's his thing
B	yeah
A	good on him
B	definitely
A	well that's impressive
B	I
A	yeah
B	kind of job I'd like to do I think
A	yeah
B	sounds horrible doesn't it?
A	yeah but I mean it's in the
B	like to do that but
A	yeah but I mean you've got a very strong sort of like yeah conviction to do it you know really
B	yeah
A	and then they go
B	mm
B	yeah
A	but
B	yeah
A	all those guys like the
B	yeah
A	older ones
B	yeah
A	all those lot
B	yeah
A	well yeah I I don't know either
B	mm
A	have thought to have gone when it happened
B	and I hate to say but I think the culture was different then
A	yeah
B	think a lot of things were more acceptable
A	yeah
B	or seemed to be acceptable
A	mm
B	dunno really
A	so then so you're not working at the moment then? but
B	no
A	you
B	yeah
A	mm
B	it's just a bit difficult with childcare it's
A	expensive yeah
B	expensive
A	no
B	really
A	no and then you'd yeah
B	they'd just limit what you can do
A	and then you don't get to enjoy them I imagine so
B	no
A	yeah
B	which is another four four years
B	it's really tough because you kind of
A	yeah
B	I wanna get my brain working then cos it doesn't do very much at the moment
A	well that's what I suppose
B	yeah but if I could get paid for that that'd be ideal
A	yeah
B	but
A	well you can do this
B	well this is what I was
A	yeah
B	thinking it's
A	yeah
B	erm
A	it's pretty easy
B	it's good money and it means
A	yeah
B	not too taxing
A	it's
B	yeah
A	erm
B	well
A	but
A	and of course that's like a good deal of money right? if you're if you just keep it on
B	can you do that?
A	people tried it on
B	right
A	and it skewed the data so the project managers
B	yeah
A	okay we have to rethink this now
B	right
A	it's up to sixty hours but I mean if you think about sixty hours times eighteen
B	how much is that?
B	my maths isn't very good
A	bit extra pocket money
A	no that that's not my thing at all and I was like
A	I was like but you wouldn't because you'd be having a conversation you'd be listening to somebody else
B	mm
A	you know I'll go I'd go mental
B	yeah
A	but you do actually if you're doing a good job
B	yeah
A	you do have to try
B	yeah
A	and yeah now I am getting a bit of that strain on my kind of like you know
A	oh dear do I
A	the
B	really?
A	with my friends I'm fine like I'm kind of like you know? but I had no idea how I was coming across
A	it's like
B	I don't think I'd do that with
A	yes I think that's probably a good idea
