A	go on The Great British Bake-Off
B	I'm not that good
A	I don't even know what this is
B	I don't know
A	er
B	are you happy about that? I'm not really very happy about it
A	I think it needed to come to an end
B	well
A	my life can't be taken up every week with the Bake-Off
B	what is?
A	I think it's the
B	I don't
A	oh is it? I don't watch The Apprentice anyway but
B	I do
A	er
A	mm
A	it was like
A	it genuinely doesn't feel like she's been she started on the tenth of September
B	nuts isn't it?
A	yeah

B	mm
A	they do get a bit OTT
B	think I might just take bread
A	yeah
B	half a tin and and bread
A	I know
B	not complaining I like spaghetti hoops
A	I like spaghetti hoops but actually it's
B	nice change
A	they're just so easy
B	yeah it's so easy
A	oh covent garden soup it was on offer actually it was a pound somewhere where was it?
A	this is a pound
B	mm
A	skinny vegetable? how do you get a skinny vegetable?
B	what that means
A	a vegetable that's been told that it's too fat and has to half its size
B	it's like mini vegetables probably
A	today
B	mini carrots
A	my boss came back
B	mm
A	and it's just basically I didn't have any but it was
B	like rainbow drops? no
A	I
B	oh I don't know
B	some American sweets
A	yeah
B	I like their chocolate
A	Hershey

A	mm
B	that's the only
A	yeah same as Milka
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	novelty when you went like to France and stuff like
A	you can't buy the big bars of the
B	that's true
A	that's still a novelty
B	that's is that's really good
A	that's a still a novelty that I go to France and I buy that I'm like hahaha stocking up on this bitch
A	mm
A	cos they brought out the Dime didn't they? and the Dime chocolate obviously is quite generic so
B	yeah
A	they did they?
B	didn't catch on I don't think
A	which is really weird because Dime Milka worked
B	mm
A	I actually really liked the erm Cadbury's with the jelly
B	mm
A	yeah yeah I know
B	like that
A	I like that one
B	I really like that one
A	when they when they brought it out it was like a limited edition I was like this is quite nice actually

B	Turkish Delight
A	yeah
B	mm
A	no
B	I mean authentic
A	you can have
B	I wonder why it
A	I think that's why I don't like it because it's rose flavour and I hate rose
B	mm
A	rose and violet-flavoured things I really don't like
B	I wonder why it's sort of that
A	I don't know yeah
B	funny thing isn't it?
A	no
B	mm
A	Reece's chocolate I
B	mm
A	erm
B	weird

A	mm
B	bananas are very
A	yeah at the moment I'm okay with them
B	I don't know I haven't had one for ages

A	it's really peculiar that you have banana cake but you don't have orange well you do have orange cake but it's not the same
B	mm
A	you have it flavoured with the juice you don't actually have like
B	wonder if it's the flavour's not strong enough probably
A	well the

B	oh
A	at the bottom of the freezer
B	found one or two
A	two?

B	ah it's the only bit I didn't look
A	yeah I had a little sneaky peak in the actual like pizza section and some of them have reduced stickers on
B	I don't know
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	probably have got a pizza in there
B	secret pizza
A	you're like getting through getting to the bottom and be like what the fuck?
B	be a happy day though
A	I am I submitted the
B	okay
A	not that it er they're not gonna obviously monitor if we move out I think that's the Thursday actually and I meant to do the Friday or
A	and it's not even though our tenancy might not end
B	yeah
A	not gonna come back here over Christmas so
B	and
A	it'll mean we might pay a bit less to council tax
B	yeah
A	so I think they'll resend us a
B	okay
A	and let us know how much cos we won't obviously won't have to keep paying a hundred and forty-five pounds each month
B	no
A	especially if we're only here for half of December they'll
B	is that like a year thing then?
A	yeah it's yearly
B	so they all
A	yeah
B	mm
A	the house is worth
A	and we started in April so
B	what if we have to pay more?
A	we won't
B	is it done by sort of
A	it is yeah it's done in by installments yeah
B	oh
A	so if we're only here till mid-December they should recalculate it and only charge us for the rest of November and then
B	so
A	no no no no
A	so whoever's having it's like remember last time when we moved in like we had to pay like you remember last time when we moved in like
A	we had to pay like
B	yeah
A	tax instalments that was just to cover
B	instalment
A	three months of that last year
B	I see
A	so
B	makes sense
A	so yeah and then I'll ring the electricity company and the gas and water company at some point so
B	okay
A	cos we need our final bills from them
B	no that's stupid she
A	yeah
B	shall I erm?
A	yeah to save us money
B	for example if I
A	mm
B	I mean if we're allowed that's all
A	yeah
B	that's fine
A	they can't charge us to be here
B	no
A	yeah
B	should be less than how much did I say it was? two hundred and fifteen
A	two hundred and that would've been in like
A	end of September wouldn't it?
B	yeah
A	so there's still October November December
B	so it shouldn't be too much
A	that's eight what's eight times three?
B	what do you mean?
A	cos you said the guy said it would be two hundred pounds to cancel it
B	yeah I know I don't really know why that was cos that's
A	that's a lot less than what it should be yeah
B	yeah
A	gave me two hundred pounds to cancel this
A	yeah
B	or or or the recorded
A	yeah er you told me this
B	mm
A	well that's twenty-four two hundred and forty-odd quid
B	ah
A	plus
B	I don't know what they were going on about either I mean he thought it was January
B	maybe in India it is January
A	maybe
B	imagine how many people they they must
A	yeah
B	them realising
A	however they just people just don't care how much they pay for their car
B	trying their luck
A	yeah I was like mm mm no no no no no
B	how often do you have to renew your car insurance?
A	mine's every ten months but that's because I get ten months' no-claims bonus as well
B	I don't know when mine's getting
A	it does but it takes it off your credit card but it sends you a letter to tell you that it's renewing it
B	is that
A	you can pay in instalments per month
B	I do pay in instalments per month
A	oh then that's fine mine was a lump sum that went on my dad's credit card
B	quite a lot of money
A	I phoned my mum I was like mum is it okay for me to leave it on dad's credit card? she was like
A	I was like so if dad complains I'd be like mum said it's fine
B	mum says
A	mum said that it's fine for me to leave it on your credit card till I can pay you back I have no money
B	I think I did mine in January not it must've been November cos that's when I got the car
A	yeah and yours just must keep
B	they're not
A	oh good
B	don't want this to come out
A	who do you have insurance with at the moment?
B	er
A	well you get new insurance when you obviously you have to get new insurance but would you stick with the same company or would you not?
B	no it's it's all done for me so
A	oh that's good
B	yeah
A	that's brilliant
B	they just do it for me
A	snazzy
B	it is snazzy but I haven't actually got to do anything with this car
A	not even service it?
B	mm no
A	that's really cool
B	yeah
A	I have to pay for my services
B	how much did my new tyres?
A	tyres are expensive
B	mm
B	even
A	no but we do have like
B	bargain
A	that's a bargain
A	what the swede and stuff? I think it will do oh you don't know when you put the fish cakes in?
B	no
A	guess

B	that's really funny
A	no
B	where does she live? in a mansion

A	and basically
B	yeah
A	boys do not understand this like it's not about him

A	I don't
B	we didn't kiss but almost did
A	you almost kissed
B	that's awkward

A	what introduced
B	no
A	yeah
B	well it wasn't
A	who the hell is that?
A	yeah it was the really the best environment to introduce
B	it really wasn't
A	but you just you don't really see them anyway so it doesn't matter
B	did you know
B	just me
B	yeah
A	we were just so unsuited he was so camp and just
B	yeah
A	just embarrassing
B	mm bit weird yeah
A	I was just like no
B	does it matter?
A	no
A	dunno what's wrong with my taste in men
B	me neither
A	although

A	and the only reason I know that is because
B	let's see
A	no I
B	can't you go on his
A	you can probably just you can probably
B	I haven't got
A	I don't have him on Facebook either
B	yeah I know that
A	dunno what he does in
B	how are you not friends with him? delete him or something?
A	I don't think I was ever friends with

B	I was thinking about him the other day actually he's actually had so many like
A	he has had a few hasn't he actually?
B	he's had a few
A	and he's always in he always does the relation the Facebook relationship status report
B	yeah
A	that confuses me
B	that confuses me as well unless
A	but
B	he's with girls that like really need that in their life
A	what they live their life through a Facebook page?
B	maybe or they just need that clarification
A	it's a bit grim
B	but if that's the case then that's really sad
A	I don't even like
B	oh god
A	we've been together for a year
B	if I did that
A	yeah
B	it's embarrassing
A	it's just horrible
B	yeah but she's doing it with all her friends now
A	yeah I did see that yeah
A	like she's always like
A	Facebook
B	via Facebook?
A	exactly why not all
B	even their Facebook wall
A	yeah
B	just weird
A	not everybody cares about what you do
B	next she'll be tagging them in statuses
B	go away
A	don't give a shit
B	is he actually going out with this girl?
A	mm
B	they're just dating
A	I don't know I think when I saw him a few weeks ago they were just dating
B	mm
A	not that
B	I think he aspires to be
A	mm
B	in terms of relationship
A	but she looks like she's completely different to
B	yeah
A	she definitely looks a bit more trashy
B	maybe he needs a bit of trash
A	yeah I still despite that they were together for what? seven years I still
B	they never had sex
A	I bet they didn't
B	no er he'd break
A	well she'd just be like
B	well she'd just have one thrust and then that'd be it and then
A	yeah
B	she'd pat him on the head
A	but they just and you can just imagine being the person that would say thank you after or something
B	I was just about to say oh I love you but then that's
A	I still think it's a bit weird if he just if he like he just
B	I think that's the wrong thing to say anyway when you're having sex with somebody
A	yeah
B	not when you're having sex
A	and it's not when you're having sex and it's not on a Facebook wall
B	no
A	and it's not after two weeks of dating
B	no
B	god
A	people
B	so annoying

A	no
B	and just eat more cos you're single and alone
A	yeah and then get fatter and then you're gonna be single and alone
B	a vicious circle
A	it's a vicious circle agreed
B	no
A	even sitting on a bus people look at you if you're sitting all alone
B	mm
A	I had that this weekend I was on the bus and this family came and wanted to sit as a four
A	and I was just sitting at the back of the bus
A	no I was in first
B	I've got every right to be here
A	doesn't mean I can't sit on the bus at the back by myself
B	mm
A	reflecting on life when I look out the window at the people in despair
B	you're all
A	cuddled up
A	oh
B	okay
A	yeah I know
B	uhu
A	just don't even know where the time is going
B	yeah
A	by the time you know it we're gonna be thirty
B	oh
A	I know I remember when we were younger and you were like when I'm twenty-five I wanna have like
B	I know
A	two out of the four children you were planning on having
B	yeah
A	so that's another five years
B	yeah
A	in the next five years you're gonna have a house and a baby
B	it's terrifying
A	it is terrifying
B	I'll have to get married as well
A	there's a lot going on in the next five years
A	a wedding a house and a baby
B	I'm not gonna do that am I?
A	no
B	think the baby'll come first
A	remember you said you wanna have a baby in marriage didn't you?
A	okay
B	so
A	but
B	true to get married
A	to get married no one wants to be fat on their wedding photos
B	marriage first
A	and obviously you don't want the baby being too young because then they'll like
B	oh I don't want I don't want babies in wedding pictures that's just
A	yeah
B	gay
A	and like babies at the wedding in general because you're just like
B	annoying
A	I want to have a wedding day I don't want to be looking after my baby on my wedding day
B	no
A	you have to get married first
B	I need to get married first
A	that means you and
B	oh fuck
B	yeah

B	yeah
A	we just planned your life for you
B	yeah five-year plan that's that's meant to be realistic isn't it like?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	well I think if I accidentally have a child I wouldn't mind having it at like thirty-
B	yeah
A	I'd be okay with an older baby an older
B	age
A	having yeah being old as a parent
B	yeah
A	no
B	oh my god
A	you've gotta think about it you've got a baby for another twenty years
B	I've got I've got
A	you so you've got to
B	and earning lots of money
A	and earning lots of money
B	yeah
A	no
A	unless somebody dies and you inherit a lot of money

B	you do the lottery and then hope that you win and then give me some money
B	that'd be shit if you did it a million times I'd have to just give just give it all back
A	you'd have to give me it
B	what?
A	some people will not be able to do the lottery a million times that'd be a million
B	how many is a million weeks?
A	yeah because I don't wanna think about that I appreciate you'd be dead by the end of it so let's not think about how many times that happens shall we?
A	so ten years is five hundred
B	okay so
A	so we're never gonna get to a million weeks
B	okay so it's worth it then it's worth it
A	we're gonna be dead it's fine
