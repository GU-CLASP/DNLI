B	which is together with talent which is very important
A	yeah so when I write the essays I really just it takes me sort of three and a half days of solid work
B	yes
A	and then I go come to
B	okay
A	for the weekend
B	and what are the subjects now?
A	erm now I'm mainly doing er Greek and Latin literature and philosophy and art history
B	gosh so it's gonna be quite demanding isn't it? art history from what period?
A	erm it's from from Archaic Greek to Late Antiquity so it's sort of eight hundred BC to six hundred AD
B	so er at some point you'll cross over with
A	yeah she always said that she was doing a lot of Roman Britain art
B	I mean I do she sends me her essays to read sometimes to read through for you know typos and so on and I mean it's so academic what she's doing
A	yeah
B	I do really admire her I mean I actually think your subjects are more interesting in a way
A	well she's doing erm archaeology it's it's gonna be a bit like that
B	but she doesn't seem to mind I haven't mentioned that I found it find it a bit boring it's heavy
B	I mean so is yours so are your subjects erm so it's of course it's ancient Greek philosophy and everything
A	yeah I mean what I liked about the
B	that's that's very demanding that's er that's interesting cos
A	yeah
B	on subjects that have been beaten to death
A	although although it's it's surprisingly people there's a famous example or famous in terms of archaeology where they had these coins sort of Persian coins and no one could understand what was shown on the coin they came up with all these different ideas and then a student at university girl at university
B	good lord is that right? well of course one forgets that even the cleverest people are mostly silly as well
A	yeah yeah
B	it's worth bearing in mind
B	either they're clever intellectually stupid emotionally or they're clever emotionally and da da da da erm that's just how it is
A	yeah I am quite hungry
B	good
A	I didn't eat yet
B	okay erm

B	so you and
B	and
A	well or I dunno
B	right
A	but all
B	does that mean that you feel a bit isolated down there?

A	mm I wanna do er
A	I mean I don't wanna have I wanna be able to think I er wanna I liked I thought very I felt like I was thinking very clearly when I had a year out so I think it's like er it's maybe do some jobs and get some money and go somewhere and do some work or something go somewhere cheaper to live

A	yeah a bit
B	okay that's nice well he must be pleased with what what you're doing
A	yeah and when I I send him the philosophy essays that I write

A	well he I think I
B	right
A	erm

A	yeah it's
B	so who is
A	it's people the
B	oh right yes okay
A	erm Parmenides
B	oh right they're before?
A	they're very and
B	yeah
A	mm and their
B	actually it's astonishing isn't it that it's left er that er that we still have it it's absolutely startling when you think about it
A	yeah
B	you know when I think of stuff that I've lost from not only my own parents or grandparents but my own early life forty fifty-sixty years ago and then we have oh
A	oh yeah
B	a leaf okay that's not very daring but it's very pretty
B	does it symbolise anything?
A	erm I got a
B	oh where's the other?
A	no with er someone else
B	oh I see
B	a girl?
A	with a girl yeah
B	have you got a girlfriend?
A	yeah
B	you've got a girlfriend? and is she in
A	she's in
B	oh the girl who
A	yeah
B	excellent what's her name?
A	er
B	terribly useful my friend
B	and so we we all said it's very convenient we'd just say how's
B	fancy that and is that her profession working in the cake shop?
A	yeah she owns erm bakeries she owns
B	mm
A	she owns one in
B	I see you're you're going out with erm how does one put it? a proper business
A	yeah she's a businesswoman
B	a businesswoman well
A	well sort of
B	not not just ancient Greece and you get cakes to match?
A	yeah
B	mm
B	some people have fallen on good times haven't they?
B	well that sounds brilliant
A	well he's called he's called
B	he's called
B	and is he nice?
A	yeah he
B	he's a painter?
A	yeah he's an artist
B	what kind of?
A	what kind of?
B	mm
A	erm
B	and why does he not sort of show or anything?
A	I don't know I don't know what he seems to I don't know what they erm he does with his time really
B	anyhow your mum's happy?
A	yeah
B	that's the main thing and he's a proper age not a child
B	oh well that's all excellent
A	child
B	well don't forget from where I stand
B	I'm certainly I have yet to meet a grown up artist
B	yeah there was a big meeting at the
B	and secondly erm
B	erm and that most money that any of us touch er certainly through the banks comes through armaments one way or the other cos it's the biggest world trade we have isn't it?
A	mm
B	I think so I haven't heard any he doesn't get up till late so I hope he's not too cross with me
B	just thought it was a silly thing to do
A	should get try and get some free fags out of them
A	be like
B	write to them and say look I've been defending you I mean I'm not defending I'm not defending smoking
A	you could be their you could be their erm sort of lobbyist in there
B	I'm not going that far I mean I you know you do have to be an idiot to smoke
A	not properly
B	no try not to because you it's very easy to get addicted like me quite apart from anything else the cost is horrendous
A	yeah I smoke roll ups
B	but you know they're going they're going to erm give their four and a half million to somebody else if they don't give it to the
A	what are they giving it for? what do they get back?
B	acknowledgement
A	so you put it in er?
B	they put it in like you know erm advertising exhibitions and things like that
A	er
B	erm no anything erm but I'm also basing it in erm ideas of geometry and proportion erm and measurement dimension so I'm trying to make these connections between the past and the and the present so it connects a little bit to you know to
A	yeah
B	cos all those initial ideas of proportion came from the Greeks didn't they?
A	yeah and Plato had above his school mm don't come in unless you know the geometry
B	yeah
B	he was so against art
A	no he is more or less more or less against it
B	well what I'm trying to look at I mean I'm only
A	mm
B	erm he you know he puts up er puts a very good argument up for the fact that it is more to do with the heart than the head
A	yeah
B	which is what I certainly believe and that it is inbuilt
A	it's very it's interesting when erm when people look at the differences between Homo sapien and Neanderthal societies the only real difference is that
B	did they not?
A	no and so and
B	but but cave painting started I mean we we know of cave paintings at least thirty thousand years ago so who were they?
A	yeah but there there was erm that's they er they existed together at the same time
B	I think I read about that somewhere so these two kinds of human species
A	yeah er protohuman species
B	they don't really know do they? I mean er
A	yeah
B	they don't know how we appeared I mean from everything I've read it's just almost as though we appeared ready made and I know quite
A	yeah well especially when you think about a hundred thousand years ago it's not that long
B	it's not that long
A	yeah everything that's happened in the
B	yeah but you see if you look at some of those cave paintings and I've been to Lascaux the sophistication is so great
A	and so he's and
B	it's about the natural drive
B	and erm
A	yes I mean there's this there's a good erm do you know that woman Camille Paglia?
B	yes yes I remember her
A	she like yeah she writes a lot of like nonsense some of the time but there's a she has a book called Sexual Personae a sort of art history book goes from ancient Egypt to Emily Dickinson and the first chapter is
B	yes yes I know yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Camille Paglia wrote Sexual Personae	Entailment
A	and sort of the
B	I do remember reading some stuff of hers which was simply over the top
A	yeah she
[ANNOTATION]	Camille Paglia wrote things that are over the top	Entailment
A	she'll er she'll like go on and on saying a lot of things that without stopping to like
B	yes
A	about without an argument
A	mm
B	erm I mean what I'm in fact I might
A	well the it's just the
B	yes
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Camille Paglia has done the research	Neutral
B	at some point? it's not long it's a couple of thousand words
A	yeah
B	to measure things and you you see it very clearly in art
A	oh right
B	erm
A	I did actually write an essay last time about erm the naked male body in art and I spent most of it trying to work out why people was er fixated by using the
A	yeah
B	I actually mean scale which is the relationship of large and small erm Jacquetta Hawkes I seem to remember in a book one of those first books that came out in the fifties or sixties don't eat too much cos I've got a big pudding for you
A	okay
B	erm
A	it's nice the salad though
B	it's delicious isn't it? I eat this every day and I er I I think it's very very good to eat it's just pickled vegetables I just shove in whatever I erm whatever I can get hold of er
A	not a novel?
B	no no no it's an
A	yeah what is very strange about only about the Egyptian sort of visual culture that it doesn't change really once it's there it
B	that is interesting isn't it?
[ANNOTATION]	Egyptians ate pickled vegetables	Neutral
A	when you look at Greek visual culture within two hundred years it's totally transformed
B	yeah well it's the same er thing with Islamic art actually you know that they won't allow that to change erm I noticed when I was in Morocco that you know it's well it's really been downhill all the way since about eleventh or twelfth century I remember in in Marrakesh there's a
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Greek visual culture had much change	Entailment
B	er and now they don't know er of course they haven't a clue what to do now now modernism has taken over erm they're still not supposed to do anything figurative everything's held back
A	thank you
B	I don't believe the brain has much to do with it erm and so I think a lot of a lot quite a lot of art is always trying to go back to to the origin where you know where it all came from it looks a bit different because we're all creatures of circumstance and we can't escape our time now I've got
A	I haven't showed this tattoo yet to my mum
B	oh
A	she won't mind I just haven't
[ANNOTATION]	Greek and Egyptian cultures influenced each other	Neutral
A	erm some place in
B	it's very pretty actually
A	it's cos erm
B	it's quite delicate
A	er we have erm
B	called what?
A	Autumn Leaf
B	Autumn Leaf
A	erm yeah I mean she emailed me the other week I wrote back
B	is she over
A	she's no she's in erm
B	she's in
A	yeah at the at
B	oh really?
B	doing what?
A	liberal arts
B	what er what are liberal arts?
A	liberal arts is an American humanities degree I told her that she
B	they aren't you know are they all
A	well in to some er er some extent yeah they're not gonna
B	they weren't in my day
A	well I think they're all they're gonna be crap if you're er if
B	I'm mean you're not saying
A	no but it's not you know it's there's things about it that I'd rather that are er
B	like what?
A	well like the
B	the culture of what? which people? the teachers?
A	for the the students
B	the students?
A	yeah
B	oh well I mean there's nothing the
A	yeah I know yeah I know well er there is probably but you know there's
B	this is crème fraîche I think erm
A	but also I suppose er like if you we're
B	but being a model is terribly boring
A	yeah but not she was
A	what? are you talking about
B	er no er
A	well maybe er I dunno I guess it's probably just like sort of the from the age of like fifteen er it was I
B	in what way? because you've travelled more?
A	just because the because of growing up in in
A	no because er no because erm cos of what that's going on there all sort of the interesting thing's like er parties that are erm the things to go to and the people to meet and then
B	so do you do you think that most of them have more conventional backgrounds than you? I suppose yes er you know your parents are not straightforward middle class working in a bank kind of parents erm
A	no
B	that you have a broader view of things
A	yeah probably I mean not like no one very few people went to schools like
B	right
A	mm
B	cos I know when you know erm when I heard
A	yeah
B	you know and you walked down the corridor and you er in single file and there's no big deal and you just did that and
A	it's it's
B	and you weren't supposed to make a a noise in class and you weren't supposed to you didn't have mobiles to listen to in
A	yeah no but
B	of course they can't teach now if if they're all if there's all that disruption
A	yeah but it was er it was a bit shit like if you forgot your pencil and you had a teacher that didn't like you you'd get an
B	right
A	that kind of thing that was a bit was what
B	yeah so you
A	yeah
B	er
A	yeah I think he
B	from you know from what I've heard he's er does he stands up for standards mm
A	he also put Latin into
B	yep
A	yeah that's erm er yeah I remember him he was here when I was there
B	was he?
A	yeah I mean he was like he seems like a sort of sadist you know
B	oh really? okay well you'll always get those you know wherever you are
A	I'm just gonna get some water would you like some?
B	er no help yourself there's a glass a glass there
A	but whilst their their project er
B	yes
A	so people go er like wanna go there don't cause the same kind of problems as the
B	oh really?
A	well it's in the in the general gentrification like one of the reasons why
B	yes of course
A	that whole area's been gentrified
B	yes
A	is cos there's good schools there
B	that's right of course yep I know I mean I've heard this that in fact last time I saw your mum which was a very long time ago she was we went up for lunch up the road here and she said there are no restaurants like this anymore in
A	mm
B	but a very nice one which is I find absolutely incredible it's happened so fast and all the houses and
A	yeah all the erm Turkish you have er sit down and have a menu and everything's like eleven pounds
B	it's incredible
A	whereas er
B	you can get a perfectly good lunch for six pounds
A	yeah I know I remember when we moved there and we we ate in the Turkish every night cos we didn't have a proper kitchen it was like you'd just sit down and er I think it was like four pounds for
B	yes and all that's changed gosh it happens fast
A	they don't though they're
B	yes but
A	I don't particularly wanna live in
B	I think it is difficult now for for
A	you can't live anywhere for er er that close for sort of less than six hundred pounds a month
B	no I mean I'd miss
A	and like all all my friends who are thirty and er they none of them have their own place
B	oh
A	they all they're all living with their friends because they
B	no the only way people can get somewhere to live is er is if their parents die and leave them somewhere to live
A	yeah
B	how is your other granny by the way?
A	as far as I know she's fine
B	er how old is she now?
A	mm ninety-five I think
B	that's pretty impressive well you may have a very long life ahead of you
A	yeah I wouldn't be
B	even your dad is not that young anymore how old is your dad?
A	sixty-three
B	sixty-three? mm
A	yeah I wouldn't be surprised if
B	er
B	there are not very many people that make a hundred and ten
A	I know but it's just seems like she seems you know a machine
B	she is
B	although as my dear friend
B	and your dad lives still mostly in America?
A	erm yeah he's in
B	and why are you going to
A	erm I don't really know just
B	you don't know you just want to see it?
A	just for the
B	oh you're going together? right
A	yeah we're flying to
B	what's the climate in
A	it's hot
B	oh it'll be nice
A	it's it the country seems quite
B	yes
A	but it's in it's like holiday season it's like good weather it's not the rainy season
A	mm it's
B	I would quite like to go somewhere like not anymore but I would have like somewhere like Peru erm Mexican art doesn't er pre Columbian art I like
A	yeah most of
B	oh yes you've mentioned that before they'd obviously made a big impression on you
A	yeah I know I'm reading it again now
B	are you? I never managed it
A	er the fourth time so
B	really? do you think I should try give it a try?
A	I dunno it depends er it's like the slower you read it the better it is and like the more you read it cos you it's a
B	right
A	of the box of cigarettes
B	right
A	so
B	yes I've got a in my book I've got a picture of cigarettes that my mother used to smoke erm I'll get you
A	yeah it looks nice
B	it's easy to read you know it's it's not it's quite
A	called Passing Clouds?
B	yes they were called Passing Clouds and I was so that is the only one I could find the only packet I bought it for two pounds fifty from Ebay
B	and that was the only answer I had so I probably have the last
B	the last cover of Passing Clouds and then there's one that you I hope you'll find interesting
A	oh yeah the stamp
B	the stamp which I've got there
A	okay
B	erm shall I dedicate it to you
A	er why not
B	why not huh?
B	granny instead
A	oh thank you
B	that's what you get if you buy them from the
B	well there is a Kiefer you might be interested in you know Kiefer?
A	I don't think so
B	Kiefer is this wildly successful er German artist erm rather Wagnerian did I have a? here absolutely massive work
B	erm I have a lot of reservations I mean one cannot but admire what he does erm
A	and
B	he's er he's alive now
A	he's alive now
B	he's just he's probably a bit younger than me
A	yeah it's the kind of thing people go for
B	they do I mean the thing is
B	is almost impossible to understand actually erm I think it'd be worth your going if you wanted to go
A	yeah
B	er as a
A	yeah maybe
B	let me know before I'm probably gonna be leaving here at half past nine tomorrow morning cos I'm gonna work in the library there actually you might like to see their library
A	is it good is it?
A	yeah maybe I'll come I'd like to see er the library
B	and I can then take you in it opens at ten we could meet at half past ten or something
A	yes yeah I'll just check what I I'm doing tomorrow morning and tomorrow
B	alright I mean if you could only come later I mean I'll probably be there I if I go half past ten I'll be finished by twelve er you know then I could erm er even go round with you if I could bear to see the Kiefer again
B	er there is also except you can't see them together there is a wonderful
A	mm
B	but you know I can always do it if I can get hold of
A	I will
B	and I think what we could do is you come up to the library with me then you could go go across and see the the show
A	do they have nice sort of work tables at
B	the
A	yeah
B	did you manage all your? would you like some more?
A	there was a lot
B	you haven't done badly
A	do you know when
B	yeah I believe Saturday just
A	yeah
B	erm
B	said that sounds like something
B	that he er he looks rather like last year's Christmas pudding
A	maybe
B	oh
A	have you seen erm pictures of her cakes?
B	no
A	should probably show you them they look quite spectacular
A	no it's her business name
B	it's her business name bake a cake design I see that's very grand oh how wonderful hang on hang on
B	yeah oh blimey
B	that's a wreath?
A	yeah
A	this one's cool
B	er what's in it?
A	yeah it's all edible
B	gold leaf? edible golf leaf?
A	er something edible gold
B	did she go to school to learn this?
A	no she's erm dunno how she learnt it actually
B	that's a wreath as well
A	erm yeah er they
B	doesn't they don't have anything else?
A	they don't have bread
B	they don't have bread
A	they have coffee it's only open on Sundays and
B	oh it's only open one day a week?
A	and on in December it's open on Wednesday's
B	right so she spends all week making them?
A	well she doesn't really she has a lot of people who work for her now
B	does she?
A	that she's trained erm so she kind of just does things like she does a lot of sort of jobs for
B	right
A	and stuff and like gets them cake for their parties she does a lot of time like going to meetings to discuss what to do
B	yes
A	and then the other people do the the cooking the baking
B	that's absolutely brilliant
A	and she writes erm cookbooks
B	does she? well er you have hit lucky be careful you don't get fat
B	oh don't you? oh
A	she makes nice er sausage rolls that I eat
B	okay
A	sure
B	if you wouldn't mind it's just one of those little things
B	so this er none of this is to scale erm but it's just an approximation of in fact I have that's what I have to do to rescale things so we've got
A	and you'll be able to round up originals?
B	well at at first I thought because there's a new erm exhibition erm head of exhibitions called
A	no
B	he's a very clever sharp probably not very profound journalist art journalist and erm I wanted to show I wanted to get something really really great like Piero's Flagellation do you know Piero's Flagellation?
A	no
B	which is arguably I mean all of these things are
B	well of course it's all crap you can't you know
A	yeah
B	er and nor should you those those really great works shouldn't travel so what we've agreed is that I will stick to the to drawing so that nearly all these are in this country
A	yeah
B	it's just such a great drawing you know so I'm drawing attention to the geometry that that's the basis or erm triangle and the stretched outness of the body and so on erm that's
A	yeah
B	of course is you know that's a whole different thing
A	and when and it would be the sort of inauguration of this new space?
B	I it probably won't be the inauguration I mean it it is very very far ahead erm but it really has to be er they they can't go out to borrow the stuff until there's a good picture of what the exhibition's going to be about erm so so this is this is how it's looking at the moment so what I want to do I haven't been able to er
B	well I'll tell you something
B	so I thought you know it's
A	mm
B	if I want to click on that and move it I can't why not?
A	erm you see I don't use this program but I can probably figure it out
B	I'm sure you can
A	how do you make the box?
B	ah you just click and drag it across
A	er so these are the instructions?
B	yes look I've dragged it across oh wait a minute I've got to click on that okay and then it should
B	it should move well it is moving there so maybe
A	but not up and down
B	but not like that and I've not grasped layers oh it's gone back to
