A	mm
B	yeah
C	oh
B	did he?
A	from from McVitie's
B	you have to get enough McVitie points you have to get like a thousand points or something
C	oh I see oh right
A	so we only eat McVitie's biscuits anyway
B	so I kind of stocked up but they went
A	so we're supposed to go out and buy ten
B	but they went quickly
A	ten at a time
C	yeah
A	and bring them back
B	and then they they suddenly
A	yes it is
C	no it's not
C	you
A	yes
C	well you can do but I mean have have I said anything which you don't want to know about or?
D	I didn't listen
C	are you going to?
A	you said you were eighteen
A	yes you can we've got software to do that
A	yeah
B	yes we do have to change it
A	so we have we have to change it put it all on the computer and change it
C	oh I see yeah
A	and then to save it as an MP3 rather than an MP4
C	yeah
A	but that take quite some time
C	mm
A	to go all the way through it and then take out bits and pieces that we don't want in it
C	yeah yeah
B	everything's anonymous anyway they they don't
C	oh yeah no no I I can see it's a very generalised
A	well I mean it's it's the way the British are talking at the moment you know? that type of thing
C	yeah
A	and they analyse it and
C	yeah
B	quite interesting really
A	it's very interesting you know and erm
B	they actually do the transcribing
C	oh I see
D	oh I see
C	oh interesting alright
B	and erm you know
C	well I
A	probably how they feel yeah
C	so I'm fed up
A	yeah
C	yeah
D	it's nice
A	oh good
D	pebbling?
A	pebbling then
D	oh years ago I guess
C	yeah long time
D	yeah
A	oh right
C	yeah
D	yeah I thought you would have
B	lemon and ginger as well
C	yes I like that yes
B	mm
A	and er apple cinnamon the one we had before isn't it?
B	yeah
D	we had erm
A	now I haven't had Red Bush I don't know what it tastes like
C	well Red Bush is I it's yes it's a bit quite a strong taste but erm
A	did it? yeah
B	oh right
C	just just erm took the edge off the bitterness and it's er
B	mm
D	then we got more muddled up
C	well you did yeah
D	no I didn't I didn't
C	we have we have a cupboard full of boxes with teabags in them and below it we have a shelf full of pots which normally have teabags in but most of them are empty at the moment
A	oh we've got that
B	yeah and we do that
A	we do that type of thing as well
A	we've got
B	and you think you've got lots of tea and then all of a sudden
A	and all of a sudden you've got none and oh
C	yeah
A	but I have to say that I am a a traditionalist with my tea
C	yeah yeah
A	I I don't like experimenting with tea
B	we quite like Earl Grey don't we?
A	Earl Grey yeah that's another one I I can drink
B	but we don't
C	yeah
A	but we're no milk and sugar in Earl Grey
C	yes
A	I just have a drop of milk in in my tea I I don't have
C	mm yeah
A	oh er The One Show
C	The One Show that's right
A	yeah
C	and they they were picking tea in England
A	oh that's right yes
A	I saw the start of that but I didn't see the end
C	yes well it was quite interesting and er they've got I mean he's he's obviously trying to sell his wares but he's
D	to China
C	to China and Lebanon
C	but it's erm it's erm
A	yeah
C	because it's up in the hills isn't it?
A	it is yeah
C	my geography's not brilliant but er
A	usually on the south face of a hill
C	yeah
A	are colder hill like our north-facing
C	yes yes
A	hills maybe
C	anyway it was it was interesting because erm where he he he made a success he's making a success of it and he had other people who were interested and so it was the possibility of having a special special tea growers I don't think there's anything very magical or very difficult about it
A	no I don't well you can grow camellias and
C	yeah that's right
A	that's a camellia innit?
C	tea teas
A	yeah well it's just quite feasible I suppose
C	yeah
A	they grow grapes now in Kent don't they?
C	yes yeah
B	well yeah
C	if you need a hillside it's a bit of a problem in
A	well there's plenty well we call erm
C	yes
D	we went to that erm winery
C	oh yes that's that that was during that was doing quite well with
A	what's that
B	yeah yeah
D	well he he was older than us he probably retired
C	yeah
D	I don't know if it was ever on the market
A	my cousin used to live right next door to that
C	yeah yeah
A	that cathedral or ruins and that was just in his back garden
C	yeah
D	yeah yeah
C	well it was quite I mean I'm no expert on wine it was a very palatable wine we used to
A	yeah
C	produce your own
D	but they would do
C	yeah
D	oh yeah
D	the whisky one yes
A	and er he he brought a bottle up
B	enjoyed that didn't he?
A	he brought a bottle up
C	is it? yeah
B	very expensive though
A	yeah
C	oh I can imagine
A	thirty-five pound a bottle
C	oh right
A	that's why I only got thimbleful
D	well you can't afford to
A	no
C	yeah yeah
A	and er
C	mm
A	saving it for special days
C	yeah
B	and he didn't he brought
A	well he brought it around here and gave us some which was very nice of him and wow I could have I could have  some more
B	that's his birthday treat
A	yeah he's you know his girlfriend
C	ah right yes
D	was this before or after?
C	that was before wasn't it?
A	that was before yeah
C	he has
A	I'm expecting he'll be round tonight won't he?
B	probably yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	well giving
A	I know which is a shame he's dropped it five thousand pounds
C	yeah
A	erm
B	mm
A	that is a shame that though he's up in Liverpool at the moment
C	is he?
A	yeah
C	oh right
C	with his girlfriend
B	couple of days
D	oh right
B	half-term
A	she she apparently got erm discounts on
C	right
D	oh I see yeah
B	it's her son isn't it?
A	that's her son yeah
B	mm
C	yeah oh right
A	they got this big discount which is
C	yes yes
B	mm
C	well he must be feeling erm
A	yes yes
A	oh well yes
B	yes it's quite
B	yes he's quite
C	it's
A	it's quite naughty isn't it?
C	well there's the The Guardian again erm have there's a double-page spread
A	mm
C	and what they thought was it was achieving or its strengths its weaknesses and so on
A	that was all on the television this morning
C	was it again? yes cos it's gonna have an independent erm enquiry
A	enquiry now yeah yeah
C	but erm
B	they're not letting it go then?
C	no they can't I just I just don't understand
A	no no
C	and there was a there was one comment from one headteacher who had been erm had a visit from Ofsted gone through the procedures
A	oh right
C	now the and there was the
A	yeah
C	and she said that's a totally artificial situation and they can't judge and they they not only judge her teaching but they judge the schools on what they've see her do
A	that's right
C	and they're in for about three days two days four days if you're lucky
A	yes that's right
C	and there's only a few of them three or four people
A	yeah
C	and erm I the whole thing is is really really flawed
A	I think it's just jobs for the boys to be quite honest
C	well I think there's a genuine attempt to bring standards up I mean there there are reasonable concerns I think about some of the things that are going on in education but it's it's the the fundamental principle seems to me you go in and find fault
A	yeah
C	and you tell them what you're not doing
A	yeah
C	you don't go along there saying wouldn't it be better if you tried this? or have seen such and such? and that's helped a lot in certain
A	yes
C	offer offer solutions not just
A	yeah
C	offer an analysis of the problems
A	yeah this is your problem
C	yeah
B	mm
A	and you're gonna get this
C	what it's doing is turning out people like better not say it on the
C	like like the lady concerned who you know obviously manipulate the
B	ah
A	she's got no conscience at all
C	well that wouldn't surprise me
A	I don't think she
C	no
A	no
C	now
C	she want heads the twenty-three thousand heads apparently when he said I'd I'd like to clone her and have twenty-three thousand heads as good as she is that sort of thing
A	what? oh dear oh dear oh dear he must have been as mad as a hatter
C	I think he
A	yes it's all government yeah
C	it should be it should be independent
B	yeah
A	yeah she was on television last night when I was did you see her on television?
B	no
C	well I saw her I did see her on once and
A	she was on last night
C	was she?
B	oh was she?
A	yes
D	mm
A	because there's supposed be an independent inquiry into the
C	yes yeah
A	and er she just walks down this corridor with a book in her hand and just places it in its proper
D	oh that's oh that's the
B	bit of film then innit?
A	same a bit of film yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah yeah that's that's quite amazing absolutely amazing
B	mm
D	we can always talk to
C	oh yes because at the school that she was at in
A	oh yes that big academy yeah yeah
B	yeah
A	I don't know what who I'm gonna vote for this time to be honest with you
C	well
D	don't want to see
C	I mean
A	no
C	it might make the candidate feel better because they've got
A	well yes that's right
C	but we're not gonna win
A	no
C	but I think I the more I think about it there are certain issues in the country which should not be party political at all they should be completely neutral with everybody contributing
A	yes
C	so the National Health Service obviously is one
C	yes
A	yeah
C	because you know this is a fundamental and
D	crime and punishment
C	yes crime and punishment yes that's right because you always get erm you know you're you're gonna change a government they've got five years a new
A	yeah and they're pushed yes
C	the the inertia of the system won't allow anything to happen for the first three or four years
A	they're like
B	yeah
A	pushing a ball up the up a hill all the time and you know they're
C	no
A	they just seem to be there for what they
C	well it's all this you know the the personal side's gone out of everything hasn't it really?
A	yes it has
C	everything's corporate and er
A	yeah
C	but erm
C	yes yeah
A	I think that's really brilliant the way
C	yeah yes it varies a bit but it's very good
A	yes I mean erm Hislop is it?
C	yes
A	oh he runs Private Eye doesn't he?
C	that's right yes yes
A	Hislop and he's now talking like cos they've changed the rules about
C	oh right yeah
A	because because of some kind of erm news
C	yes unintended consequence maybe
B	they just puts allegedly in everything doesn't it?
A	yeah
C	yeah yeah
A	yeah you've gotta put allegedly before everything now
C	yeah
A	but I remember Ted Heath when when he was in government er at one time I think of course we were everybody was protesting at the time and marching
C	mm
A	he made it against the law to have more than eleven people congregate
C	yeah that's right yeah
A	is that still against the law?
C	I don't know I think you can't but you can declare a state of emergency
A	yeah
C	and erm he he was he was the one who turned all the lights out
A	that's right yeah
C	and er cos in fact I I was up for interview
A	yeah
C	when that was going on
C	but er
A	yes it was weren't it? yes yeah
C	the unions did need putting
A	well we didn't mind the the lights going out at night cos we'd get to bed early
D	well we got stopped by the police didn't we? on our way through Derbyshire
A	did you?
D	and that was
C	oh gosh that was very frightening yes going through
C	across the
D	yes
C	yes
D	we were all going how long we were gonna be there
C	yes yes where were we going?
A	oh they did didn't they? yeah
B	oh
C	and er it was very very erm they were very tense and it was a very uncomfortable
A	well it was a police state at the time weren't it really?
C	well it it I wouldn't like to take on the miners actually
A	well no but
C	but but the rights and wrongs of it were I mean were just buried and it just became a sort of
A	well it became a great big
C	yeah
B	mm
A	and we went erm I think it was Maggie Thatcher that
C	oh it was it was all her yeah
A	yeah she just she just just shut industry down didn't she?
A	yeah she did didn't she? and er I remember
C	yeah
A	and they were throwing marbles under the
D	horses
C	horses
A	horses' hooves
C	oh yeah yeah well
A	that wasn't very nice was it?
C	yeah well
A	no
C	they've probably were drafted in from all around the country
A	yeah
B	mm
C	in order to
A	they were probably Metropolitan
C	well could be yeah
A	literally
C	yeah mm
A	I watched a programme this morning er about the brain
C	oh yeah
A	of a man and a the brain of a woman
D	oh yeah
A	oh that was brilliant
A	that was
B	I I only caught little bits of it
C	now remember every word is being recorded
A	yes but that was brilliant because
A	that's okay
C	right
A	the brain apparently is identical only a little bit smaller in a woman which is natural I suppose
C	oh
A	no that's physical
C	that's
A	yes that's physical
D	mm
C	mm
A	there's literally no difference and the only difference is
B	mm
A	right
C	mm
A	and you have the left one and the right one
C	yeah yeah
A	and this is why woman can multitask
C	mm well that's not true any longer is it?
A	no
C	men are men are crying on television every night aren't they?
B	they are
A	they are yeah well I I cry at a
B	yeah
A	I watch you know some heartbreaking thing and then
C	mm
A	I can't help it I I'm very my mum used to call me
C	yeah
B	mm
A	yeah I used to well
C	yeah the the
A	yes
C	and er
A	oh yes it has yeah
B	oh yeah
C	since the fifties and sixties erm there's still an element of the man being the key breadwinner and the mum being associated with bringing up of the children
B	mm
A	yeah that's right yeah
C	and even though you may share it
A	no
C	yeah
A	right
C	yeah
A	it was a a male baby but dressed as a
C	yeah
A	as a girl right they gave it to the man
C	yes yeah yeah yeah
A	you know
C	that's right
A	and they did the same with the woman only they had a
C	yes yeah
B	yeah
A	and they were saying that er it's the way we react
C	yes yes that's right
B	mm
A	and everybody's the same they start off the same until we change them
C	mm
A	they all start off on a level playing field
D	yeah
C	ah yeah yeah
A	and then we we say well you're female and you're male we'll bring you up this way and we'll bring you up that way
C	mm
D	mm
A	and and that's how it's done and that's
C	yeah
D	mm
A	other than gender of course
B	yeah they do tend to give them that type of toy don't you?
[ANNOTATION]	In the beginning, every one is said to be the same	Entailment
A	you do
C	yes yeah
B	but er
C	but it's
A	that's right you do
C	bricklayers you know they're slowing being
A	yeah
C	it's all getting mixed
A	that is getting mixed yeah
C	up and er the more that happens the less likely the dumper truck will
C	go in one direction
A	but er you know it's just how we we have been brought up
[ANNOTATION]	The distinctions with regards to gender happen more in families with heterosexual parents.	Neutral
C	yeah oh yeah yeah
A	so we bring up
C	yeah
A	at all in fact that was even worse in Victorian times
C	yeah
B	a lot
A	it's a lot better now but that was worse in Victorian times whereas
B	and lots of boys that we looked after they er they loved dolls
A	they do
C	yes
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	The boys that Speaker B took care of enjoyed playing with Barbie dolls.	Neutral
C	yes of course you had all this yes yes of course
B	yes I mean it's just equal equal really isn't it?
C	yes yeah
B	basically isn't it?
A	yes that's right yeah
[ANNOTATION]	The situation in the worlds has improved a lot since the Victorian era.	Entailment
B	yeah
A	but it's it's really weird because
D	mm
A	even the women are giving them
C	yes
[ANNOTATION]	Many boys are into playing with dolls.	Entailment
A	guns swords
D	yeah
C	yeah
A	you know to play with
C	mm
A	and they wonder why you know they get hold of like anything and crash someone over the head with it don't they?
C	mm
A	but they if they gave that to a girl as well she would do the same
C	mm
A	it's you know and that was really really interesting very interesting programme I was stuck to it all night
C	mm
B	you were
C	when I was a child my er my father would never ever let us have any guns
B	well we wouldn't let ours have any
A	no we didn't let ours no
C	so what happened is that you started making them out of little bits of
C	and then I had a Meccano set so I used to make them out of Meccano
A	well
B	but that's different though than
C	it is different no I quite agree yes
D	yeah cos
A	well
C	yeah
A	cos we lived in
C	yes that's right
A	Lash LaRue or or Roy Rogers or something like that so when we came home
C	yes
A	but they were our guns I can't believe that you know we were
C	but I remember feeling really deprived because most of my friends did have
A	caps guns yes yeah
A	me and my younger brother had er cap bombs
C	oh yeah
A	you put the cap in and I swallowed it
C	oh god
A	my brother said I want it I said I ain't got it
A	went to get hold of it and this great big lead
C	right presumably it is gone now is it?
A	yes
A	yeah
C	mm
A	oh I can't I can't believe that my mum went lairy absolutely spare
C	yeah yeah
A	give it time
B	mm
A	I didn't get up terrible things we were we were Just William type boys we we played like Just William you know the book Just William?
C	we had a yes we the the bigger the biggest difference between our childhood and modern children's childhood is what we did during the day cos come the summer you come the holidays you'd leave the house
A	and that become
C	just go you just go across the fields
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	with your friends and nobody thought anything of it
A	no
C	you come back you knew when lunch was you came back for some lunch
A	that's right
C	and you go off again and you come back
A	that's right
C	and the
A	no we were never home never home
C	these days that just just doesn't happen at all there's not the same freedom of movement whatsoever
A	we used to
A	yes
C	quite a lot of land is on the
A	oh right yeah
C	absolute oh you know terrible
A	that's a rat race innit
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	no
C	but it's
B	oh dear
C	second time I think he damaged the car more than himself
A	oh dear
A	no you can't
C	your you know the garden is locked
B	yeah
C	or
A	when I used to live in
C	yeah
A	when I was a kid that was just fields and just up the hill towards er
C	yeah
A	and never go up there you know? they they were the
C	oh yes
A	did you ever do that?
C	yes we did it
C	we used to use spend a lot of time at the railway line
A	yes we did
B	this is the difference between men and women isn't it?
B	we didn't do stupid things like that did we?
C	and there's a footbridge over the main there's
C	and er it was steam engine times of course
A	yeah that was steam engines
C	and we used to stand on the top of the parapet
A	so did we yeah
C	and we thought it was very exciting
A	that was brilliant
C	nobody fell over the wrong way fortunately
C	yeah yeah that's right
C	I mean my parents had no idea what we got up to
C	yes yes
A	with
C	yes that's right
C	well it's a cork you stick a cork into a tree
A	yeah then you you push the pith out
C	yeah
A	with a and then put the cork all the way through it
C	yes
A	and you make a nice bit and then we carved we literally carved out
C	oh the missile yeah yeah
A	the handle to push in
C	yeah
A	and that was made out of erm er hazel
C	mm mm
A	right
C	yes yes
A	for ages and bash it on a on a brick or something to make a brush
C	yes
A	what we called the brush and that used to fit up the end
C	yeah
A	then you get an acorn and you bite the acorn in half god they taste awful
D	I was gonna say they're poisonous aren't they?
C	yes
A	yeah bite the acorn in half and bash that down down the middle of the
C	yes
A	pop gun and then you had a belt you had to have a belt
C	yeah
A	and then push it bang that used to go
C	yeah
A	didn't you?
C	well I
A	yeah
C	catapult sort of thing
A	catapult kind of thing
C	yes that's right
A	oh they were brilliant
C	yeah
B	I think you're proving there is a bit of difference
C	but yes well
C	if you'd sort of
C	well we used to we used to we would do stupid things we used to climb the haystacks and they were big big haystacks
A	oh yeah
C	and they erm
A	we used to tunnel into them
C	that's right well and and you'd get the the the you got to the very top and then you slide off
A	that's right
C	and then you'd have about a ten foot drop you know?
A	yeah
C	you used to you think
A	no you didn't did you? just bounce down and
C	well what we did
A	no
C	but er
A	well we used to have a farmer called erm I think er I think his name was
D	oh yes
A	and there was a farm er
A	up the back of ours of the down what we called
C	mm
A	and then you'd pull your
C	mm
A	that was great fun though
C	yeah yes well
A	great fun
C	yes distance lands enchantment
A	but we did have a tom girl tomboy come with us all the time she was she was always with us she
C	yeah yeah that's that's true we we had
A	yeah
C	and yeah we and we had erm some erm oh what were they called? they sent them up from
A	oh the the
C	evacuees that's right
A	yeah
C	and er
A	yeah
C	but er they they joined in
A	yeah
B	yeah so you had them living with you did you?
C	yes we did
B	ah
C	my father was away
B	yeah
C	the the
A	yeah
C	and they'd come from Kent so I imagine Kent was relative well perhaps less dangerous than
A	well my my grandma got bombed out of her house up Church Street in in The Blitz
C	yes yes
A	what they called The Blitz
D	mm
C	yes
A	when Norwich got it really bad because of
C	yes
A	they were making all the women were working at
C	yes that's right
A	so they tried to bomb bomb
C	yeah
A	but they missed the cathedral and they missed a lot of the churches
C	yeah
A	yes yes
C	and there's there's an article in the local paper about it the other day wasn't there?
A	yeah
C	showing the Zeppelin damage done
C	well what was weird was why anybody thought it was a problem the Zeppelins were a problem they fill them with helium
A	yeah
C	it's bang dead easy it seems to me
A	yeah
A	you can't miss can you?
C	yes
A	I just thought if if you do hit one that will go
C	yeah
C	well they I didn't see any Zeppelins no
D	well I think we saw
C	I think they're mainly propeller aircraft about
A	yeah
A	dad did did bring
C	did he?
A	so this is my mum's
C	yeah
C	yes
A	in our back garden
C	yeah
A	and mum apparently fed them all and
C	yeah well you you were taught to ride weren't you?
D	yeah the German Cavalry
C	yes cos they had
A	yeah
B	ah
C	and my
C	and er
D	they were waiting to be repatriated
C	they were waiting to be repatriated and er
A	oh yeah
C	they most of the
A	yeah
C	they were very nice you know
A	yeah
C	it was it was I was quite intrigued to meet someone just cos
D	no I don't think so no
A	do as your told you will sit properly
D	we used to do erm
A	oh right ah yes
D	to see how many you could get on
D	yes
A	yeah
D	anyway
A	I seem to remember we used to have more snow in the winter then
D	nineteen forty-seven
C	oh yes we nineteen forty-seven was a really bad year yeah
A	yeah
C	I remember walking er trying to walk to school and giving up because it was just
A	yeah
C	erm
D	yes we sent a a larger boy
C	I mean the the my memories of er
A	yes
C	which you used to scratch
A	scratch it off and then
C	because they they only had you know erm about two or three bedroom three bedroom house whatever it was
A	that's right yeah
C	and you'd have one warm room
A	that's right
B	oh
A	and that would be the sitting room
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	yeah we had to live in the kitchen yeah with of course you know
B	sat in the kitchen and everything
A	when the council houses up there they were just like we we could only afford one warm room
B	because it was so cold
C	yeah
A	and they had them air bricks where you
C	yes
A	you know they'd be up up in your bedroom as well
C	yes
D	yeah
A	and they'd be freezing cold and we had a bell hanging on the on this fireplace and the draft would ring the bell
A	that downed how bad it was don't it?
C	yeah
B	mm
A	god that was bad
B	actually we tried to light a fire there as well
A	yeah
B	there was a lovely true burner in the kitchen which is really nice
A	yeah we
C	mm
B	just a little
A	mum used to sit in front of the fire
B	they're lovely
A	like this area in front of the fire and scald all your legs
C	yes
D	yes yeah
A	all the legs got scalded
B	mm
C	yes
D	how's your time
C	sorry?
D	how's your time? because you're
C	no no it's fine I
A	oh yeah
C	erm she'd got my number from the website as a bookings officer for the hall and she's doing a project looking at rural schools
B	oh
C	present and old rural schools and of course the village hall was the school
A	the old school yeah
C	the old school
B	mm
C	and then I can show you around and you know if you have questions so erm I mean I don't know
A	well of course it is yeah
B	yeah
C	it's just it's just
A	they may be able to help us out with the hall
C	that's right yes exactly
B	yeah
C	so I just need to do a little bit of homework just to check on when the
A	oh yes yeah and then to
A	yeah
C	they moved
D	somewhere by the
C	mm
A	oh I heard it was erm
D	oh right
C	well maybe they they just cut themselves off we don't know
B	yeah it's a shame when they loved it so much
C	yes that's right yes
B	obviously
C	but they they've erm
A	yeah
C	eighteen forty-seven
A	oh right
C	erm but it's interesting because erm this is going back to well going back to that time you see
A	yeah
C	nobody saw the need to learn to read and write
A	no they didn't no
B	mm
C	nobody did because they just worked
A	well they worked on the farms
C	on the farms
A	and that was it weren't it?
C	and er it was it was always important to have at least one person who could read and write someone to keep the books and that kind of thing but as far as the general population was concerned it was a totally unnecessary er process
A	it was weren't it? yeah
C	and the other intriguing thing which I came across where I
A	yeah
C	and er they didn't have a problem exactly but the younger children from
A	oh right
C	where I imagine this it was perhaps a more I don't know informal comfortable situation than having a a very big school
D	well there were there were three weren't there? there was the
C	oh right yes the erm yes what school? it is called what's what's the name of the little? there's a one of the lanes
D	fire
C	erm
C	there was a school there
A	that was a school was it?
C	which
A	oh right
C	he's coming along to meet her actually cos he'll he'll fill in any gaps
A	he will he's brilliant
B	mm
C	but erm
A	yes
C	and they had to do it then but er
A	did they have to pay for it? pay
C	sorry?
A	didn't they have to pay?
C	oh yes it wasn't it was yes they still had to find money for it
A	yeah
C	but it was done it was it was this was really done by the Church of England because the Church of England wanted to take some sort have some sort of control I think of the population
A	yeah
B	so how many could they take? how many pupils could they take there?
C	there were oh in in the twenties or thirties or something like that
B	yeah
C	it was it was erm
B	quite a lot
C	the main hall there
B	mm
C	and the other thing which I think is wrong in the book there's a photograph which they claim is of the old school and I don't think it is
A	isn't it?
C	because the
A	that is yes
C	the same sort of age as the rest of the building they're not aware
A	the only thing new on that porch is the clock isn't it?
C	yes that's right
A	yeah
C	but erm anyway well it's I'm not I'm not going to
A	yes
C	if she wants to have the information
B	mm
A	did you read it all did you the book?
C	oh crikey no
C	I I mean I dipped into it
D	very dense
C	it's it's it's a very difficult style it's a very academic style
B	oh
C	and totally unforgiving you know?
A	yeah
C	there's no humour there there's no lightness there at all
A	oh I see
B	oh
C	and er she
D	well we didn't give her anything
C	well we had nothing to give her
D	no well that's it
A	what about the old
C	erm they they she does quite a lot on
A	yes
C	the
A	yeah
C	and then there's the then the erm there was the forge was part way down
A	that's right all the way down
D	yes
B	mm
C	and erm there's
A	oh I see right
B	right
D	and er cos all the others all the others are
B	yeah
A	yeah yeah cor
B	mm
C	but it was a
A	yes
C	the land of gentry but there's no significant family at all in this area
C	sorry?
B	yours must have been the most important house in
D	well it's not at all that old it was
C	eighteen sixties eighteen eighteen fifty-seven
D	it replaced something
A	oh right
B	oh
C	and er
A	yeah
C	and because it was for the workers plural
A	yeah
B	mm
C	in in the brick field in the brick yard
A	they found the old brick kiln didn't they apparently?
D	yeah yeah
C	yes
A	didn't pull it down did he?
C	erm
C	I don't think it was well I would be surprised if it was any great significance
B	mm
A	oh
B	yeah it is interesting isn't it?
A	yeah
C	yes
B	and they grow up
D	we were told that our house was called
C	yes
D	but because there's a
D	farm in the village
D	yeah
A	oh right
B	oh right
D	they they they were asked to drop the
B	mm
D	that's how it became
A	oh I see
D	so it gives the impression that it's older than it is
B	yeah
D	I don't know whether that's true or just a
C	the the other thing which is intriguing and I again I don't I don't think the evidence that
A	yeah
C	and then there was another shop erm
A	oh
C	so it was the
D	well she sold honey didn't she? so yes it would be
C	well I mean we're talking about when it was built
D	oh I see
C	when it was built and I can't see there's enough room but the the office is is er where the dining room table is
A	yeah
B	mm
C	erm and you can see the marks on the floor and everything to show where er desk was
A	there's a picture of
C	yes
A	I don't think so I mean
D	well they had goats
C	well I think no the
D	don't know
A	oh
C	oh it was a substantial yes there was a substantial erm er
D	oh I don't know what
C	I would guess that the goat farm is much more likely to be nineteen twenties thirties
A	strange that we kept goats as well innit?
D	yes yeah
C	yeah
A	that's really weird innit?
D	erm
C	I don't know who you're trying to describe
D	the people who lived in the house before us the old lady
