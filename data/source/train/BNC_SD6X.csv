B	indeed
A	if you're doing that many things you can't do any of them well
B	well no there's nothing wrong with it
A	well yeah but er the chips were really not very nice
B	this to be good

B	I hope
A	I'm not even sure if wine  We could just have beer
B	sorry?
B	did you want to break your thing and have some Persian tea?

B	five and thirteen
B	oh

B	work in publishers
B	ooh that looks good
A	hmm? Which one?
B	er under er special Persian dishes

B	six
A	oh kleftiko

B	ooh
unknown_female	this um
A	mm
unknown_female	thing that I don't know what they call it here

A	like a goji berry is it?
unknown_female	it's it's a lot smaller
A	okay
unknown_female	and it's
A	hmm
unknown_female	a lot more sour
A	okay
unknown_female	a er a or er I think I dunno I've I've seen this

A	so
unknown_female	ten
A	yeah

A	sure
unknown_female	er that's er spicy
unknown_female	I mean most of the Persian dishes they're not spicy at all
A	yeah
unknown_female	I mean they're most they're even sweet than you know like sort of spicy
A	mm
unknown_female	I I would
A	yeah
unknown_female	I love it
A	does sound good
unknown_female	but then it's I mean it's a kind of like a sort of it's because it's green
unknown_female	some people they don't like it

A	okay
unknown_female	you'd I mean you will
A	so
unknown_female	be able to move afterwards
unknown_female	so
B	okay
A	what we could do is does that come with pitta breads? Or?
unknown_female	er it doesn't
A	so we could get one of those and some pitta breads for the dips
B	yeah
A	would would that be?
unknown_female	yeah
A	that'll be cool

A	yeah
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A will change clothes.	Contradiction
B	cruising
A	hmm?
B	cruising
A	cruising if you will
B	yes
A	we should put carpets on our walls
B	well you say that
B	and I want one of those National Trust tapestries
A	I think that would
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A is fond of wall tapestries.	Entailment
B	there's nothing wrong with a good tapestry
A	there's nothing wrong with a good tapestry
B	exactly
A	but I just think it might look odd
A	do you not agree?
B	no
A	you can't  you can't  just put nice things together and they don't sometimes they're less than the sum of their parts
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B thinks the tapestries will not be weird.	Entailment
B	I'm I'm disliking this
A	what? You can't just put nice things together?
B	mm
A	wasn't there a time when er
B	oh yes
A	I was like yes
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A hates synthesising from single parts..	Contradiction
B	ooh I'm buzzing
B	I like this new er text tone
A	mm
B	one new message
A	I'm wondering whether I should text
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B has a message on the phone.	Entailment
B	do I even?
A	um
B	about what?
A	by saying were you  were you  listening when er I was talking to him as we were getting in the taxi?
A	saying something like he couldn't get there on Saturday night
B	right
A	mm
B	from quite a while ago
A	well I think he'd er he'd texted and assumed I'd got it
B	Cos
A	he
A	it's a Sunday so
B	exactly
A	I mean
B	and let's face it
B	well when what does he mean you can't get?
A	well er he
B	going to see friends in London?
A	and he's not gonna get back
B	he's already agreed to
A	I don't know how long he's had this arranged like
A	I think he's just trying to sort of
B	well if he can get to
A	when? On?
B	or we can get er er but to be fair er he's gotta be able to get well the last train's not until about you know midnight
A	mm
B	well we'll probably still be up but

A	thank you very much
unknown_female	okay
B	thank you
unknown_female	thank you
A	mm
B	what? The following morning?

B	um
A	mm
B	I mean it's gonna take sort of two and a half  two two and a half  hours to drive
A	yeah
B	so I was thinking leaving maybe seven thirty?
A	yeah
B	you know we can get up at like six thirty
A	mm
B	definitely need to leave time though just to make some lunch
A	oh right
B	yeah
A	sort of chill
B	someone can make lunch while someone cooks dinner
A	yeah
B	well you can do both while Dan and I watch TV

A	that sounds excellent

B	you can't get random people to sign your
A	no I know we can't
B	consent forms
A	shouldn't
B	mm
A	how bizarre
B	there's huge cross-over
A	mm
B	mm
A	there's a big bit of aubergine
B	mm
A	mm
B	mm
A	is it good?
A	I'm not surprised
B	no
A	it's fried something
B	hmm
A	how's this one?
B	mm
A	hm
B	hmm
A	yeah
B	mm
A	mm
B	mm
A	mm
B	which one?
A	the aubergine one
B	mm
A	mm
B	are those two the same?
A	yeah
B	mm
A	tzatziki
B	mm
B	I just wondered why you were going for the one closer to
A	yeah
B	hmm
A	you can turn it round
B	mm
A	that is different
B	yeah
A	sort of
B	no
A	oh right
B	mm
A	huh
B	er to be fair I don't think he put enough sedative into it
B	can I have the er half a one of those?
A	do you wanna whole one?
B	are you sure?
A	mhm
B	too late now
B	mm
A	I'll try mine now
B	from the point of view of actually sort of having it before I eat it
B	mm
A	mm
B	can I have a couple of pitta breads?
unknown_female	how's the starters?
B	oh it's lovely
A	really good
B	thank you
unknown_female	yeah?
B	er could we have another couple of pitta breads please?
unknown_female	yeah yeah
A	thank you
A	hmm?
B	mm
A	yeah
B	mm
A	but um no I'm glad we ordered it
B	mm
A	mm
B	er
A	you wouldn't really be able to eat it without pitta breads
B	well you just eat it off a fork
A	kind of weird though
B	I think you're weird
A	very nice
B	yes
A	mm
B	mm
B	it's actually a perfect starter
A	mm
B	particularly filling
A	yeah
B	yes
A	yeah
B	the problem is a platter of joy
A	it's a problem cos er
B	is essentially a meal in itself
A	mm
B	mm
A	but you also really don't wanna main course
B	mm
A	mm
B	the problem is with putting loads of things like potatoes
A	yeah
B	mm
A	wraps
B	mm
A	that's fine
B	yeah? Okay
A	eat half of it
B	ah dear
A	mm
B	perfect timing
A	perfect timing
unknown_female	yeah?
A	thank you
unknown_female	sure
B	excellent
A	oh this one's got more herbs in
B	so have you rung Wimpey back about anything recently?
A	oh damn it
B	no it's just
A	mm
B	that rubbish is still there
A	well she did say
B	I'm not sure it's going anywhere
A	no well it's not
B	hmm
A	I was talking to
B	sorry well in all fairness they're quite inoffensive
A	well yeah
B	passively annoying
A	that's what I was saying
B	mm
A	they're quite pleasant when you say hello to them
B	seem friendly
A	seem friendly enough
B	yep
A	and they're not really any you know have tiny kids or a big dog or anything
B	mm
A	apparently her she lives next to these three massive guys
B	right
A	apparently they're all massive
B	yeah
A	then there's some sort of thumps
B	who aren't sleeping sorry?
B	how noisy can it be?
A	well
B	and where does she live?
A	um
B	er right
A	I'm not sure
B	as in does noise come from above? Below? From side to side?
A	side I think
B	that's why we're detached
A	yeah
B	ah so apparently er you know the garage
A	mm
B	you know that they've got er two quad bikes
A	your dad said
B	yeah
A	that's why they're not using it
B	yeah
A	mm
B	plus two quad bikes
A	one garage
B	mm
A	think they just don't have room for them
B	probably just parked on the
A	well yeah the
B	damn it that
B	I am half tempted to buy a really shit car for about fifty quid
A	mhm
B	like er a couple of hundred quid
A	that's what they've done
B	mm
A	I mean they have we have as much right to it as they do
B	well it does move occasionally
A	in all fairness I don't think we're allowed to put a
B	yeah we are
A	oh
B	just declare it statutory off the road
A	yeah
B	so we don't need to insure it
A	mhm
B	yes
A	theory test
B	oh right
B	that wasn't in my theory test
A	hmm
B	they clearly updated it
A	yeah
A	it's all kind of little things like that
B	nothing to er actually do with driving
A	no
B	yeah
A	your local MP
B	hmm
A	yeah
A	you've got tzatziki in your beard
A	got this trail of it
B	gone?
A	gone
B	mm
B	mm
A	mm
B	huh
A	with me um quite thankful
B	yes
A	which is nice
B	mm
A	so yeah
B	mm
A	all in all it could be worse
B	I thought next week like on Monday or Tuesday we could have a poker night
A	mm
B	with some drinks and cards
A	sounds very pleasant
B	yes
A	and then if it dissolves it doesn't matter
B	mm
A	it's an excuse isn't it
B	and it means we don't have to do dinner
B	mm
A	but
B	no I think it works really good well as a six
A	mm
B	rather than er you know
A	rather than pairs
B	mm
A	yeah
B	just now we feel like we're excluding whoever
B	mm
A	they we both liked
B	mm
A	independently really
B	mm
A	having said that we first met them really at
B	mm
A	as in we spoke to them briefly
B	mm
A	but yeah
B	they did solve the cleaner problem beautifully
A	oh so good
B	I'm so glad
A	is it nice?
B	yes
A	Good
B	bed's made again
A	oh
B	pillow's are the wrong way up
B	it's fairly obvious
A	that's the way they're meant to go isn't it?
B	no it's not
A	okay
B	no I'm good
A	I don't wanna overdo it
B	I think
A	I dunno
B	yeah but only by a couple of hundred percent as
A	mm
B	well turkey is
A	but it's economies of scale though
B	mm
A	the staff is the expensive bit I think probably
B	where?
A	wine-glass
B	mm
B	oh I I think it does
A	pretty relaxing
B	mm
A	but it was massive
B	mm
A	Cos we used to have sort of reddy brown leather settees
B	yes
A	and
B	that put you off leather
B	wasn't our settee the perfect choice?
A	it's a very good choice
B	I know
A	there's a bit of a dent where I lean on
A	with my elbow though
B	and I was so right wasn't I?
A	mhm
B	yeah
A	and we can sit independently
B	and we can quite comfortably get three people on it
A	mm
B	A squeeze
B	yeah
A	it's quite nice to have that option
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about have option	Neutral
A	I don't think we need a chair
unknown_female	um
unknown_female	how was your starter? But I think
A	but yes er
unknown_female	the answer was good
A	the answer's in that
unknown_female	yeah
B	that was er er that was sort of really trying to think of a good description
B	like perfect as a starter
[ANNOTATION]	person B is talking about football	Contradiction
unknown_female	no no
A	not too filling
B	mm
unknown_female	yeah
A	really good
unknown_female	it's we er we have a lot of those stuff er we have for starters
unknown_female	so then er and it
A	true
unknown_female	doesn't fill you up so
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about doesn't fill it	Entailment
A	mm
unknown_female	um are you guys ready for the main course? Or would you like me to just give you a couple of minutes break or?
A	ooh
B	I think we're probably ready?
A	yeah
B	um
A	I think we can go for that
B	and er wine?
A	yes
[ANNOTATION]	they are not sure that it is ready or not	Neutral
B	er could we have a bottle of the shiraz please
unknown_female	yeah of course
A	thank you
unknown_female	er
A	I'm glad you looked
B	I'm sorry?
A	I'm glad you looked
B	well it was house er in terms of red it was house red shiraz or Italian red
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about house	Entailment
A	so you went for the middle one
B	I think
A	yeah
B	mm
A	there's a little  there's a little  fire going there
B	hmm?
A	have you seen the little fire?
B	I know
A	it's really cool isn't it
B	sorry?
A	we should get a fire in our kitchen
B	I'm all for it
A	an intentional fire
B	although I do have a fire extinguisher and a fire blanket
B	my list of things from when we moved in
B	was so comprehensive
A	Cos they're just in there
B	mm
A	we should mount the fire extinguisher on the wall
B	mm
A	this is a safe household
B	I love how
A	we comply with EU regulations
B	yes
B	I love how when we were before we moved in I was really concerned about getting a safe which was bolted down
B	I probably should check that
A	yeah
A	that'd be quite funny
B	mm
A	mm
B	as in it's er
A	I think if yeah
B	as in what?
A	it's not the biggest concern I don't think
A	mm
A	mm
B	but
A	but if you knew someone was trying to nick your identity which you would cos the safe would be gone it wouldn't be so bad
B	exactly
A	it'd be
B	yes
B	very clever
A	and obviously that's the problem with it
B	mm
A	I
B	yes
B	no one would take the guitar
A	they probably would
B	how much is it worth?
A	five hundred pounds
B	fifty for that case? Really? Oh
A	I got it  in with the guitar but it's a nice case
B	well surely that way you'd just get it actively temperature controlled
A	mm
B	heat pump
A	mm
B	which would
[ANNOTATION]	The case is ugly.	Contradiction
A	you you can probably get them
B	mm
A	um
B	you can probably get a humidity control as well
A	mm
B	no I mean like active humidity control
A	mm
B	it won't be good if it's too dry
A	wouldn't dry it out
B	if not
A	if you really care
B	if not could make one
A	if not gap in the market
unknown_female	right um who likes to try the wine? Who's the er?
A	ooh
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B knows hot to play the guitar.	Neutral
B	um

A	thank you
unknown_female	is your father a wine expert?
B	mm
B	prior to this he's
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker's B father was a sommelier in the past.	Neutral
unknown_female	mm
B	generally er er
unknown_female	oh
A	if he tastes wine he's always like oh
A	knock it back
unknown_female	yeah I mean I  think I I  think the same as him as well
unknown_female	if it's a wine it's a good wine
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker's B father appreciates a good glass of wine.	Entailment
A	yeah
A	thank you
B	that wine is very very reminiscent of the starter
A	oh right
B	no no
A	dip pitta breads in it
A	as in perfect
B	interesting
[ANNOTATION]	The wine is white.	Neutral
A	but yeah we should ooh sorry was I on your foot then

A	it was very pleasant
B	yeah
B	I really can't take you anywhere can I
B	you just just like a trough
B	per unit mass
A	per unit mass it was wasn't the cheapest meal
B	thirty or forty?
A	thirty or forty on top of that
B	and that was a wine with each course?
A	um
B	yeah
A	so the proper people do it like that
B	yes
A	Cos Masterchef's finished and the finalist's been
B	mm
A	and it's like properly pricey
A	pff
B	that's not too bad
A	which wasn't too for what it was it was
B	no you can
A	for the
B	right
A	and then they had like premier
B	surely that that's not that expensive
A	Gordon Ramsay?

unknown_female	I think so
A	mm
unknown_female	yeah
B	make an exception

A	it's like
B	indeed
A	oh
B	request specifically chocolate
A	I'm gonna have a Persian tea
B	ooh I'm debating now then
A	huh
B	oh huh

B	have you pointed out to him that he had agreed to come ours?
A	no
B	well do you want to?
A	er okay
B	as in he does kind of need a firm hand sometimes and I think you know the whole the plan was that it was an integrated er thing
A	mm
B	and er I think it er would in some a lot of ways it would be better with four on Saturday night than three
A	mm
B	well er it's not acceptable just to ditch
A	mm
unknown_female	um did you  did you  manage to see if you were having any
unknown_female	is there any space left?
