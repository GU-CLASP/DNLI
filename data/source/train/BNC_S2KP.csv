A	oh no
B	I did it a couple of weeks ago I was really upset about it
A	little bit worried
B	er
C	does it still go?
B	it still works fine my concern is where this has come out I'm worried that the
A	I am a bit concerned about it
B	you know what I mean?
C	well what
B	yeah I mean er
C	get some of that tape I've got tape it down the
C	take it back take it underneath
B	yeah
C	underneath and up there that'll stop it
B	let's do that then yeah? cos I don't need to I mean the only thing is with it would be if I ever wanted to take it to uni but I never really need to do that
A	and we're alternating anyway so
B	yeah so I really need to take a laptop in but we do have another one that I can take in
C	you could get rid of that
A	surprised you didn't tell them
A	she was quite upset about it
A	only had it for about a week
B	yeah so
D	how did you do it?
B	I just like
A	like ten hours a day
B	I don't know how I did it exactly yeah that helps a bit it's just taking the weight off the wire
C	yeah yeah yeah
B	yeah that's good
C	might wanna double up on that little bit actually just er
B	I kind of leant on it as I got up with it
D	mm
B	like leant on it
D	mm
B	kind of shaken it
A	they are quite flimsy on the screen aren't they? you can't apply much pressure
B	I wasn't really thinking about what I was doing I was distracted
A	the plot thickens
B	I can't remember what now we was arguing about something and I wasn't thinking about the laptop on my lap
B	there we go well that is also
A	well we don't argue
B	there you go that's
B	no
A	I've broken all of her laptops
B	he's broken the last two genuinely
A	not out of anger
B	it's not like I actually put my fist through the screen or anything
A	well that was one of them
A	she left it on the table with the cable connecting the laptop to the
A	the sofa and I walked past and
D	ah it pulled off
A	yeah so
D	yeah
A	but
B	sure you don't wanna cup of tea or something dad?
C	no I'm fine
B	drop of water? do you want any you want tea not coffee mum?

B	I was gonna ask
B	would you like some
A	some water
B	water
B	no
A	no
D	oh you don't?
B	it's cold enough out the tap
A	it's nice just being about to drink it out the tap
A	it's been a while
D	yeah definitely
A	it's different here to back at my mum's
D	it's even different er in different parts of England
B	yeah that's what I mean
D	yeah yeah oh when you say back home you mean
A	yeah
D	mm
B	I prefer the water
A	it's a completely different flavour in
D	mm
B	but I much prefer the water in
A	you've got lots of chalk so it's quite soft
B	yeah I think it really makes a difference
D	mm
B	I don't know if it's I wouldn't say our water's soft I think it's quite hard water
A	chalky's quite soft isn't it? I thought
B	it doesn't like do you remember like in
A	er
D	well I don't know because in
A	limescale that's hard water
D	so that's hard water
B	ah
A	and round my way we get loads of limescale and that's hard water
B	yeah
D	so that ours must be quite soft cos I never have to de-fur the kettle ever
B	no no no
D	yet I was
B	but the water it's ah maybe then
A	chalk is soft I'm pretty sure
B	yeah
B	it's nice
D	yeah the our our water
B	it tastes different too
A	I prefer the taste of hard but I grew up with hard
B	yeah well I always thought are you sure
D	well I think that might that might be what they put in it
B	yeah yeah
C	have you got a Phillips screwdriver here?
B	oh right yeah well isn't it? I thought I passed
A	there should be a screwdriver under the sink I don't know if it's Phillips
B	I feel like the water in
D	yeah
B	I feel like this water has a flavour almost like chlorine or something
A	it's also the pipe your own piping can affect it as well
B	yeah that's true mm it's just what you're brought up on as you said what are you after?
D	but even
C	screwdriver
B	didn't you bring yours with you? did you forget it?
C	it's in it's in the car somewhere I think it's in the back where you was
B	no I couldn't find it
A	let's have a look in here
D	when
B	the water?
D	much nicer the water tastes than it does in
B	yeah I think so I think it it hasn't got the same I really don't
A	which was round is it as well? like shampoo foams up better in one of them I feel like soft water yeah
D	soft soft water you get more lather
A	like soap and shampoo
B	oh really?
A	yeah
D	mm
A	but round where I'm from it doesn't
B	ah
D	does it here?
B	yeah it seems fine although this isn't that further along from
D	no
A	there's quite a bit of chalk around here as well
B	yeah
D	mm
A	if you see the white cliffs aren't far from here
D	yeah
A	even closer there's like
B	yeah
A	it's it's you only have to go a few kilometres er out of

A	nicely done
B	we wouldn't've wouldn't've stumbled across it
B	although er we didn't get anything in it but
D	no
B	it's just something else for dad to look round
D	and then it was sort of getting on a bit then so we had to get back to the car cos we only had the three hours
B	yeah we were almost at cos we walked along the lanes so we were almost coming towards the road that the train station road intersects coming down to Aldi so I thought oh we'll just walk to the charity shops but it would've been another ten minutes and then going around those charity shops
D	mm
B	and then had to have got all the way back to the car
B	and we only had fifteen minutes to do all that so
A	so you didn't go to

D	yeah
A	named after my mother's first husband
D	oh that's a bit odd innit?
B	oh is he just happened to be called
A	it's not
D	oh
A	he is actually named after er
B	he likes to he likes trying it
A	well it was even worse actually
B	do you wanna move this a bit closer to mine?
A	named after my dad's friend from the children's home that ended up committing suicide so
B	even more joyful
B	there you go just like your high chair
A	he named ten people from his home that he used to know out of those ten only three are alive
A	six have committed suicide and there's one that some other death
B	some other death
D	good grief
A	out of ten that's terrible isn't it?
D	that's a high percentage of suicides isn't it?
A	cos he was showing me footage he got sent some footage er he's in about a second of it
B	oh what? when they were children?
A	yeah mm
B	oh really?
A	yeah
B	oh yeah
A	my mum might even be in it a little bit somewhere
B	yeah cos they all worked in the children's home his mum and er his
C	another voucher
B	his
A	yeah it's all a bit weird
B	bon appetite international buffet as much as you like
C	set that thing up while we're here make sure it's alright for you
B	alright alright
B	yeah one yeah once he was in a
A	yeah so once he'd left so he left at like seventeen and then he came back at like nineteen or twenty and got a job there and worked there
D	oh
A	and
A	so they were good friends and obviously
D	yeah
A	not with with my mum it wasn't my dad that cheated on my mum though it was the other way round
D	oh how weird
C	do you want me to take the back off for you? no?
B	oh it's got a little two gigabyte US er mini card in it has it?
C	yeah
B	definitely works does it?
C	no course he ain't it's brand new
D	he's tried it
B	where's how do you get the battery out then?
A	it's brand new is it?
C	give us it here
D	mm it is it's never been used
A	oh it does look brand new
C	it is
D	it's still got the
A	did you say
D	yeah he
D	he's in working in recycling er now and somebody'd thrown put it in the skip
A	he was working with
D	yeah
A	what happened there?
D	well it it only lasted a couple of
A	oh no
D	when
A	that was a good job as well wasn't it?
C	I'll take that off don't need that sticker on
A	so wasn't he working with the binmen before?
D	yeah
A	so is he back with the same people? or different?
D	no no
A	no it's recycling?
D	he's recycling now yeah
A	has
D	yeah
B	yeah
D	so well I see it on the news that erm they'd been striking
A	oh it is on the news?
D	they have been on the news yeah
B	yeah
A	this is week three now
B	did I give you your water darling?
D	but they're not they only
B	no?
D	they only actually had a one-day strike or something didn't they?
B	I don't know how it happened cos our bins are meant to get collected on a Monday so not the Monday just gone today's Thursday so not Monday not the Monday yeah not the Monday before that it's been since the Monday so it's gonna it's it's been three four weeks by by this by this coming Monday since we've had anyone collect our rubbish
A	every morning there's like rubbish on the floor where the cats have been
B	yeah where the cats keep getting into it and stuff
D	oh
B	like ours happened I think it's only because the lady that lives above us she's lived here for twenty-five years she said
D	oh
B	she said that she it really annoys her cos she said
C	do you want me to take the paper off?
B	erm yeah okay oh no just leave it on for now
C	leave it on?
B	erm she said she actually paid to have it re-carpeted herself once cos
D	the lady who lives above you?
B	mm
D	oh so these
B	it's a two it's a two-bedroomed flat up there
D	so this house isn't owned by just one person then?
B	no no
A	no
B	there's different landlords
A	yeah
B	got different flats
D	oh
B	so the bit in the middle is no-man's-land
A	fancy owning just a bit of house
B	I know cos I remember how she said that she lived here cos we met her outside the door once you know so like
D	I thought she was the landlord when I first saw her
B	yeah we thought maybe she did own the building
D	mm
B	she was doing she does the pot plants outside the front door and she said yeah I've lived here for twenty-five years no one's ever done anything none of the walls have ever been repainted she said one year I did the carpet myself cos I got so fed up with it and again I went out yesterday and it's all been hoovered out there and I reckon it's probably because she tries to try and sell it
D	mm
B	or she just wants to keep it nice because she has some respect for it
A	when the binmen go on strike shouldn't it be the responsibility of the government to hire temporary workers to do it still?
A	I don't feel things just shouldn't get done
D	done mm
B	I don't wanna just lose my credit on the internet or anything
A	I mean the strike still has an impact cos the government effectively has to pay twice
B	yeah
D	mm
A	they pay for the strikers and they pay for the temps that are gonna do the job but to just leave it
C	you move it across the button
A	well we're still paying our taxes
B	oh yeah
D	yeah
A	and we're still paying you know your council tax
D	council tax
A	why isn't it being collected? I mean obviously
D	but but it wasn't er I mean they're not still striking it was resolved and it and I mean and I'm sure it was only for like a day or two days so why it hasn't been collected for three weeks I don't know
B	don't understand how to get to the menu though
C	no
A	very strange we've had the recycling round
B	oh here it is
A	we had them round earlier this morning
B	mm
A	but
B	mm
A	no erm
C	SIM card's alright?
A	we won't be able to last much longer if they don't come on Monday I don't know what will happen
A	go back to medieval times
C	don't know darling don't forget you ain't got the back on it yet
A	is it working alright?
B	yeah
C	bit complicated innit?
A	yeah these BlackBerrys
A	it's pretty good though
D	a contract with their phone contract and didn't want the phone I suppose they just wanted the contract
C	unless they threw it out by mistake
B	what? enter this PIN into your wireless router? why have I gotta enter a PIN into my router? how would I even do that?
C	what's a router?
A	can't enter a PIN in a router
A	do they have any instructions?
C	there's a book in there
D	have you got a
A	is it asking for?
B	yeah but it's not asking for the PIN router it's like telling me to put a PIN number into my router
A	well don't use the wireless
B	mm
A	just
B	no I just thought I'd
D	perhaps that's just the way it's worded
B	no it had a PIN number what do you mean? so when something says put this PIN number into your router
C	mm that's what it's there for
C	silly person
B	well no I don't maybe you're right
D	mm
B	it's it's word
D	means the PIN that it wants the PIN number for
B	but it had a number er for me to put into the router
D	oh did it?
B	yeah
D	oh
A	you can't put a number in a router so I don't really understand
D	no mm
A	oh you're taking photos
B	oh it's got a much better camera on it than that other one oh I'm becoming
B	got something else to learn
D	it's not the latest blueberry it's been out a couple of years
C	no
D	have I said the wrong word?
B	it's a BlackBerry
D	a BlackBerry
A	a blueberry
B	it's classic parent
C	you ain't got the back on it yet
B	yeah alright
A	I think blueberry sounds better
B	that's what dad calls it
A	start calling it a gooseberry or a raspberry
D	it's not the latest one so obviously he's probably had it a couple of years and
B	ah people'll think I'm well flash
C	no he hasn't had it a couple of years it's just never been used
D	he hasn't hasn't used it no
D	so he he he didn't necessarily
A	oh it's got a full-on keyboard on it

C	mm
B	not sure then
C	what does? the carpet?
B	yeah
A	I did have a cigarette out the window
B	no it's the ashtray
B	I mean it's the carpet it's been in
D	it is clean
B	it's never been used I think it's just been stored somewhere
C	yeah yeah that's why I go and look for it I thought
B	it's the underneath that smells cor
C	it's yeah
B	I'm sure that'll go away over time
C	yeah that'll go
B	already looks
C	drop of whisky on it
B	preserve the carpet
A	in all fairness most people don't sit on the floor and smell the carpet
C	I thought I thought it had a nice little pattern to it
B	huh?
C	nice little pattern on it
B	I do I like it I like green goes with the brown and the blue and the orange
A	it's a real nice mix of
D	well that's greenish in the middle isn't it?
A	which bit are you looking at?
A	the square I mean I
B	is there a bit of green in there
B	it's not black
A	blue oh well I dunno if I'd go for bluey green
D	mm
A	I'd go for like a browny greyey green
D	mm
C	browny greyey yellow
B	I think the word's black you're looking for faded black
A	ah which bit are we talking about here?
C	the squares
A	you're looking at that bit aren't you?
D	yeah
A	I I was looking at the that that colour
D	mm
A	yeah that's a bluey
A	it's like a bluey grey
D	mm
B	it's like faded black
B	which I guess in to a certain er at one at some point a fade does kind of look green
A	we've er squabbled a few times over colours
B	that's cos you've got you blues and your purples confused
A	whatever
C	so are you doing homework tonight?
B	yeah should do yeah
A	yeah we have to
B	don't feel much like it now
B	says it's connected to that wi-fi
C	I dunno what these other bits are oh it's er earphones
D	have you had to get more contact lenses since you've been home?
B	no
D	no
B	these are the same
A	you bought some just before we left
B	yeah I bought er
B	but these are the same ones I opened I think when I first got back I don't think I've opened any more
D	mm
B	cos I don't erm I mean I don't know I don't know
C	ah
B	and they gave me these ones that they might just be a week or two week ones that you're meant to dispose of but I don't wear them every day and I don't wear them all day every day now I'll put them in just before I go to uni and then I take them out when I get home and erm
C	you put the other
B	so I don't change them
C	if you go travelling
B	they tell you not to do that of course but I only change them until I can't use them anymore
C	you got your two-pin one you can plug in when you go abroad
C	yeah
B	and they do get
D	mm
A	that's a good idea isn't it? rather than making you buy another one
C	yeah
D	mm
B	you can tell when one of them's got a scratch or sometimes
A	it just slots in
A	should all be like that
B	and it's actually got a little split in it so it just affects your vision a little bit you can tell
D	so when you want new ones you go to the opticians do you?
B	yeah in Korea I just hand in my box of my last one
A	yeah it's just like going to the shop
B	and they were just over the counter
D	oh
B	whereas in England they'll probably check your eyes more often
C	that's for your laptop
A	oh is that for transferring
C	yeah
B	maybe not too often
D	yeah
B	once they but to initially get them in England you have to go through a whole checkup trial period with them whereas in Korea they just gave them to me
C	yeah
A	seems crazy
C	yeah
B	and I had to take a box in and stuff there might be more to it technically
B	but maybe cos I'm foreign they don't worry about it
A	oh well their loss our gain eh?
B	so yeah
D	I suppose
B	they're cheaper in Korea
A	oh it comes with a case as well?
C	yeah
A	have you seen the case?
B	ah I don't know what the
B	no it's not
B	yeah it's just a
C	yeah
B	so you don't lose lose it in your bag and scratch it and that I suppose
D	I suppose if you drop it it gives it some protection as well
B	yeah
C	or lean on it
B	just to protect it in the bag
