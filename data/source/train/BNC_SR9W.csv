B	yeah
A	okay right so is this a good distance to throw from then?
B	yeah I think so
A	so you
B	but I
B	we could go further we could go like let's try this yeah
A	so I mean how are you gonna do this?
B	as in before I had it like there and we were both spread out so
A	okay so
B	so when we were talking just now it was like that whole
A	yeah
A	okay so do you wanna be a little closer?
B	no this is fine
A	okay cool perfect we'll get equidistant
A	and it can pick up everything
A	yeah
B	the whole like the fact that you're being recorded in some way makes you change your erm the way you speak and what you talk about
A	so like the uncertainty
B	really?
A	yeah
B	oh so that's er
A	and that is like the scientific equivalent of this wherein
B	okay
A	when you know you're
B	erm okay what about could you translate it into attributes of character? so
A	okay
B	it's like
A	can you elaborate on that?
A	yeah but I mean like what? so you're are you talking about erm characteristics in relation to being recorded? or characteristics in the whole idea of uncertainty
B	of self
A	principle? of self?
B	yeah so how much does the self change when you think about it?
A	oh that's good you lost me there for a minute but in that
B	yeah sorry cos I
A	last sentence you you brought it all back you whipped it round erm
A	it was it was like an eclipse I I lost sight of the conversation for a second there
A	yeah
B	erm and it's happening er to an extent now
A	yeah
B	but
B	it was like a it was like it was almost as if like we weren't chatting to each other it was like a radio show
B	and it's happening now cos like
A	I'm not gonna lie there have been points in this conversation where like
A	I'm talking to you but my eyes are kind of just flicking towards the phone like
A	like we have some kind of mediator between us
B	I know we need to talk about something like
A	yes
B	that is
A	abstract? solid?
B	that is what we'd normally be talking about
A	right so let's
A	great
A	destroying
B	what are the other options?
A	all of my ideas there
B	when I was when I was out getting the shopping I erm I wanted I like wanted to do two things when I got home one was watch an international rugby match
A	uhu okay
B	cos I was feeling quite patriotic for some reason
A	right
B	and I was whistling erm
A	Jerusalem?
B	Jerusalem
B	and did those feet
A	of course you were
B	erm
B	erm and I incidentally went to Sainsbury's
B	bought
A	incidentally
B	erm
A	went to Sainsbury's?
B	I went to Sainsbury's bought my er
A	I was walking along quite merrily
B	bought my items
A	and I found myself in aisle three of
B	and er bought
A	oh
B	no the other way round
A	what? you went to Tesco?
B	Tesco's for my items and Sainsbury's for my oats cos they are
A	are they better oats in Sainsbury's?
B	better oats
A	apologies by the way your er current oat bag has a hole in it
B	a hole?
A	a hole
B	which
A	there was a bag of oats on the table on Tuesday
B	oh yeah that's history now mate
A	when
B	wouldn't worry about that
A	which it sliced through quite cleanly
A	a bag or two in one day?
B	ah that's a bag ago yeah so it's fine I used that up this morning
A	you use a bag of oats per day?
B	not er not a bag
B	that particular bag
A	your face suggested that
B	it wasn't
A	you were really self-conscious about that like yeah
B	it wasn't new unless was it new
A	so
B	yesterday?
A	no it was used
B	oh then yeah I didn't use a whole bag then did I?
A	well you might've done
A	it was most of a bag surely
A	tangents
B	see this is good this is less like a radio show it's more like
B	normal conversation
A	mate we would have the absolute worst
B	we would have no listeners
A	radio show no one would listen
B	or they would and then turn it off
B	immediately
B	for half an hour
A	with guest star
B	when the conversation gets dry we just stick
[ANNOTATION]	A guest star would improve the radio show.	Entailment
B	for a few minutes
A	mate with
A	I've said it before I'll say it again the man can chat for days
B	our conversations do turn towards
A	they do I think the friends are a er
B	they're an ever-present force in our
A	they they
B	in our rhetoric
B	magnetic field
A	a magnetic field?
B	they they
[ANNOTATION]	Someone who talks a lot also speaks very loud.	Neutral
A	oh you mean magnetism?
A	that's something that's applicable to humans rather than I mean I guess we have magnetic fields but not
B	how big would we have to get in relation to another object?
A	oh erm
B	do you know? or not?
A	it's not size erm
[ANNOTATION]	Magnetism concerns human attraction.	Entailment
B	is it
A	really
B	relative is it relative to? no it can't be relative
A	no no there are two okay two things firstly we don't really have a magnetic force like
B	oh
A	we have we have iron within our blood which I guess could technically be magnetised erm you know how you can make like iron filings magnetise by
B	yeah
A	rolling them on a magnet? I guess if you like rubbed a human enough against a magnet
A	they might
A	but interestingly by the laws of gravity we have a gravitational attraction to each other so
B	minimal
[ANNOTATION]	Iron in blood  works as a magnet.	Neutral
A	you can
A	nought nought nought nought nought nought nought nought one of a newton roughly er a pascal or a
B	sounds so
A	the most ridiculously tiny force but you can't ever truly say I'm not attractive because
A	you are
B	what happens if you're standing the other way? are you repulsing them?
[ANNOTATION]	Pascal is not a type of force.	Contradiction
A	gravity kind of doesn't have er a polar opposite
A	like nope inverse
B	oh
A	oh
B	oh
A	oh
B	oh
B	I wouldn't do something like that
A	cheers
B	cor mate that was a good FIFA sesh today as well
A	it was a
B	dismally
A	no don't don't no you don't say it ended abysmally it ended very well for you
B	yeah well it ended well for me for once
A	yeah
A	I'm not gonna lie that actually hurt but
B	oh come on come on
B	in other news The Musketeers are back on BBC Iplayer
B	yeah
A	oh
B	do you remember The Musketeers?
A	yeah I loved that show
B	there's a preview so like maybe in a few months' time
A	oh goodness are we still gonna have live
A	they were thinking of erm the BBC are considering erm because there's been a fair bit of privatisation going on around that kind of sector you know
B	they're gonna privatise the BBC?
A	they're not going to they're trying to like the government the Conservatives are trying to
A	like bit by bit it's a very long plan like there's a four or five-year plan for it erm which obviously could get stopped at any point but it's very subtle because it's such a long
B	yeah
A	plan but basically the upshot of this is doesn't matter cos that's if it does happen it's not gonna happen for a while what could happen soon
B	BBC Iplayer you have to pay for it?
A	BBC Iplayer might have to be a paid service pretty soon
A	what?
B	what?
A	TV licence is a hundred and fifty quid
B	oh is it really? ah
A	per household and also you know we already have one
B	yes
A	for a bit
B	mm I've watched
A	live TV like physical live TV forgetting Iplayer live just live TV I watched probably about two episodes
B	but
A	two half an hour episodes of something on E four when we first got the aerial set up
B	the actual live TV
A	yeah
B	so I watched a few things live on the Iplayer
A	oh no that that's a separate category we'll get to that in a minute slow down
B	yeah
A	so live TV like
B	no
A	no?
B	well oh
A	I don't think she'd know where to plug it in properly erm cos to be fair it's a mess of wires up there like who knows what's the difference
B	yeah
A	between an aerial and an Xbox wire up there
A	erm I I as er as I said I've watched two half an hour episodes of something on E four erm so that's it so of live TV with the aerial which we got subsidised twenty-five pounds for because I'd pestered
B	I've watched a fair amount live on the Iplayer
A	really?
B	I've watched sport
A	you've watched sport
B	erm I watched rugby games
B	I watched erm one or two
A	oh exciting
B	and that sort of thing you can't substitute that cos you can't watch rugby matches the next day in terms of like everyone else knows the score and you don't so
A	well then don't ask em
B	I've tried that
B	it's not as fun
A	I mean no it's not as fun but is it worth fifty pounds a year?
B	mm when you could also just go to the pub I suppose
A	yeah I suppose yeah but oh
B	yeah I went there to watch a rugby game actually
A	ah
B	erm local
A	local?
B	it wasn't like it wasn't like the
B	er
B	more
B	more like a cross between
B	a
A	yeah
B	well this is this is less than cosy but it's like not
A	I'm just imagining the village hall back in
A	you can have draught
A	oh goodness
B	the other thing I was
A	exotic
B	the other thing I was erm quite fancied watching was University Challenge
A	oh University Challenge
B	I was in that sort of I don't know what the sort of mood that is when you wanna watch international rugby game and University Challenge I think it's a
A	I'd agree you got the sport the intellect
B	and er
B	oh culture so
A	yeah athletic academic cultured that's the three of us
B	what a house what a house
A	great house great mix
B	yeah
A	but I'd say that we
A	yes we're emblematic of
A	yeah?
B	we don't have a small group here
A	oh okay yeah
B	if we don't have a small group
A	we won't
B	just
A	yeah
B	when you're leading one
A	mm I'd still very much say if I'm still considering whether I'd say yes at this stage
B	good
A	because although it'd be a great thing to do like and I'm
B	yeah
A	get work done if I get through with two ones this year I'll be happy
B	yeah
A	but I'm gonna be honest my aim next year is to push as hard as I can and if I can scrape a first that'd be incredible
B	okay
A	erm so but yeah no I mean cos you're you're not doing
B	I'm not I'm gonna switch off a little bit there and er like you focus a little bit more on
A	yeah I think that's what I'm gonna do
B	and
A	erm
B	erm
A	oh
B	yeah I think she is
A	yeah
B	erm good on her
A	yeah definitely she'll lead well with
A	I mean it's can you believe can you just imagine how
B	do you think do you think they're similar to each other in terms of their like personalities? cos
A	well they're both tall vaguely blondie brownish hair both private school
B	is
A	I'm pretty sure he's a non-board private school
A	up in
B	landed
A	obviously he's
A	slightly different kind of private school vibes going on there
A	but er
B	yeah both extroverted but like I wouldn't
A	they have two different humours and
B	yes
A	manners of just you know
B	yeah
A	they're not hugely dissimilar
B	yeah
A	yeah in fact who would you liken
B	you have
A	is he a unique one?
B	he's a unique one isn't he?
B	I've met people like him before though I just can't remember where
A	oh oh gosh
B	you tempted the that's a good move you tempted the kicking there
B	oh
B	there you got it
B	non er
B	oh
B	right I'm not gonna
A	yeah wait where were we before we were talking about how dissimilar and similar
B	University Challenge
A	yes yeah University Challenge that's great great show
B	oh
B	Wednesday
A	oh dear Wednesday is it?
B	so
A	oh
B	er before we leave here I'm gonna try and er talk to that girl
A	what? about?
B	next to the brown
A	uhu
B	about how attractive she is er what?
A	oh great
B	classic me mate
A	yeah
B	the shark
B	the shark
A	I mean yeah
A	yeah I'm oh
B	did he really post his erm?
A	he did
B	did he really post?
A	he said that on Twitter he said that he erm
B	that's gonna be
A	yeah I mean like
B	do you reckon they'll get onto that? or not?
A	to be fair if a future employer sees that and it's possible erm it's not hugely likely but it is possible then you know that's not gonna go down too well for him as to whether like the exam board will find out I have high doubts they will
B	yeah
A	there's not a chance that a university cos er it's it's internally marked isn't it?
B	yeah
A	so I have I'd have doubts that a university of several thousand students
B	sorry
A	would bother to check
B	yeah
A	I mean Twitter's big but it's a little slightly more niche than Facebook
B	but do you think there's any way of checking like the hashtags? like or something like a similar hashtag kind of thing where they have the words so if they have like a sentence that says something like
A	yeah yeah and even if they did to be fair the exam board can't actually do anything about it because
B	he might be lying for all we know
A	because there is no way first of all telling that he's telling the truth and second of all that it's him
B	yeah yeah
A	it could like it could plausibly be a friend messing about with a parody account
B	a bitter jape yeah
A	a jape yes
B	bitter jape
A	banterous jape
A	there's nothing wrong with a bit of bitter japery
B	no
A	did you have nickname in college?
A	did you have a nickname in
B	no
A	and bear in mind I mm there are
A	we're before
A	watershed so I mean
B	I didn't actually
A	you didn't?
B	no
A	to your face
B	to my face
B	I was erm
A	oh
B	like no one no one
B	else was
A	thrilling
B	outside
B	outside
A	that's an exciting hockey story behind the nickname
A	so how did you get that one? well that's my surname oh goodness gracious
B	yeah
A	oh
B	but that's only that's only a nickname because
A	there was
B	no one else
A	more than one
B	you don't get
A	oh
B	well obviously you do in
A	yeah
B	it doesn't happen at lectures people don't say oh hi
A	well
B	why? did you?
A	erm not really
B	the lads that they were
A	took to calling me
B	why's that?
A	erm I think to be honest it was just trying to detract from the fact that they just both had really bad nicknames through their own fault
A	well
A	erm
A	and like I agree with him on that front but when you're in like year eight or nine you don't be like oh
A	so we just immediately like he's an old man and old man turned into like just absolutely ancient
A	one of my favourite jokes about was when we'd play football with him someone would slide tackle him
A	it's what happens when bones get fossilised
A	erm so it was just any kind of I think for a while we called him Father Time and stuff like that
A	erm but
A	but to be fair
A	people are like oh hey who are you? he'd be like I'm
A	but call me
B	did you at that point or not?
A	he didn't he knew like
B	did you at that point know though?
A	yeah
B	as in okay great
A	so every now and then we'd just call him
A	and then for some reason
A	I think that's his gamertag as well on Xbox cos you know
B	nicknames are so bad
A	it's it's just so weird like I have no idea why the only thing the only thing I can remember about its origin was that a little while after he'd
A	yeah
B	like there were some great nicknames in the hockey club cos of course like in the first couple of socials
A	yeah
B	you just like if you wanna get a nickname you do something weird and wonderful and then
B	you get a nickname for the rest of your life
A	nice
B	and er so there were some horrific ones my favourite being erm I think his name's
B	I just
A	yeah
B	and when you see them week in week out and on the pitch you're screaming like
A	yeah
B	their nicknames it's like so one is one is erm
A	what was this?
A	yeah
B	I know his name's
A	yeah
B	so er like high up in the ranks he was
A	yeah
B	just moved into second team but trying his luck and he erm and he puts himself forward as the flick taker for the team so it's like
A	oh
B	oh I can take flicks like I do that a lot I like take flicks
A	oh okay
B	and erm and like flicks very rarely happened so they were like oh fine you know
A	yeah
B	and then he erm and then er there was an opportunity to take the flick and erm like er there's er it's like a penalty in football only
A	yeah
B	more rare
A	oh okay yeah
B	and erm and so they were like oh where's where's
B	and he goes like and just
B	and er
B	erm and I saw him in Sainsbury's today erm
A	nice
B	erm my
A	nice oh man I hate those
B	as a fresher
A	I absolutely hate that
B	and he said he was in a he was in the Shreddies ad as a kid
A	what?
B	so he's he's Shreddies
A	Shreddies
B	and one of the guys
B	names is erm is Fun because he's the guy
A	yeah
B	erm and you know they like sometimes choose the family will like choose names that they think will er fit in with like the society here?
A	yeah
B	and so
A	they're like yes that that will do
B	erm what else? er oh that was weird
B	Captain Scarlet
B	sorry Captain Black yeah erm
A	more like cat tin black
B	woah
A	so
B	which guy?
A	so
B	yeah
A	and you were mentioning another guy
B	oh his name's Fun
A	in oh Fun what? and that was his I assume that was his nickname as well
B	that was the name his parents chose yeah
B	erm okay what else? er erm the classic are like obviously the classic nicknames are the are when the erm the surname's been played on which is just the best
A	obviously
B	erm
A	the last straw for example
B	yeah amazing
A	lol
B	erm
A	should probably send him a text at some point
B	erm
A	oh
B	it's when it goes so far as to then it's changed their name
A	oh yeah you know you know how his name is
B	yeah
A	most people call him? and
B	yeah
A	then
B	so what's?
A	so then I decided to call him
B	okay yeah
B	that was amazing
A	and I think I've probably commented on a post of his at one point saying
A	and he was like
B	so that's
A	yeah
B	that's changed a man's life
A	no harm is done but that did remind me of er a friend's life who I
A	may may have slightly caused
B	some injury
A	to so okay have you heard the story of
B	no
A	so back story I had a friend called
B	Miss
A	I think it's Miss
B	oh
A	so oh la la so we're erm
B	oh really?
A	we're doing
A	we're
B	a man's life hangs in the balance in secondary school
B	just to put that in context
A	it really does he he wasn't having an amazing time of
B	really?
A	time of it either and
B	a
A	LEDC and MEDC
B	yeah yeah okay
A	more economically developed country so if you're a more economically developed country you get more resources if you're less you get less resources
B	classic
A	in this case resources were I
B	oh nice so you actually have the scissors or the
A	so it's production yeah yeah yeah
B	so some people but some people would be rich in natural resources so like
A	yeah so for example I was the I was either the UK or the USA I was a big country big dog
A	erm so I had lots of scissors and lots of pieces of paper whereas some countries like India had one piece of paper and some countries just had like no paper or no scissors so they had to try and barter for it
A	the way that I managed to win this erm was slightly cheating I decided to outsource so I was like
A	if you come over and do half the work with me I will give you a third of my winnings and Skittles with the money so you were producing with
A	but the money was technically Skittles the more you produced the more Skittles you got
B	okay
A	so I was like well come over here I'm outsourcing to your country now we're working together you do the work I do a little bit we're gonna win because obviously I have way more resources than anyone else so I won that way
B	nice
A	in the modern way of winning
A	forget old-fashioned work
