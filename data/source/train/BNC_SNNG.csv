A	there we go which one is mine?
B	yours is that one they're not very
A	right
B	big are they?
A	they're not actually no
B	well mine's bigger than
A	yours er yes
B	this is gonna sound so rude but I thought what
A	oh whispering now?
B	oh is it on?
A	yes
B	oh
B	I was going no but it's fine I was gonna say what a grumpy unattractive set of serving ladies
A	er yes she she wasn't happy then
B	no
A	that's why I said to her she said
B	oh I didn't
A	I knew this would happen
A	cos they'd just sat down hadn't they?
B	I heard you say I
A	and then I I said oh I'm sorry
B	I
A	you know you feel a bit embarrassed to be there as a customer
B	I heard
A	but she went oh I knew this would happen
B	I didn't I I
A	yeah no and she's that look on her face and she was a bit grumpy at having to serve us but there we go
B	mm
A	we've got our tea
B	yes thank you
A	so who who resigned then and why?
B	so
A	has she been there a long time?
B	er few years but she's had behavioural difficulties she's twenty-four
A	mm
B	she's a good worker she's very intelligent she's very very attractive but she doesn't believe this and she is constantly having counselling for her weight issues of which she doesn't have any
A	oh god
B	but you know it all stems back to
A	oh yeah you said yes
B	I'm a bit more patient and like she's
A	right
B	so anyway so she came into my team and like I say
A	oh that's hot mm
B	she didn't want to move desks and she
A	how long ago
B	er
A	was this?
B	erm January
A	oh
B	when she first came into our team
A	so not long
B	no
A	no the PDR when she said all this
B	oh the PDR was erm week before last
A	oh
B	yeah
A	so a week before last she says all this
B	yes
A	and resigns today
B	yeah erm so she said all of this then she said what her plans were for the future and would we support her in getting there and she wanted to be
A	mm
B	more involved in the health and safety process she wanted to be the contact for risk assessments and erm insurance claims and all of that sort of thing so we set her up with people to get into contact with and she's developed this erm
A	oh
B	and erm she's responded really really really well really well then last week she said cos I've always known it's her ambition to be cabin crew
A	oh really?
B	she yeah she got asked for an interview from Virgin
A	oh okay
B	and she said months ago she had the first stage and she thought nothing of it and then about three months after she got a telephone interview and then that was er about another five months ago and she said it
A	gosh that's a slow process isn't it?
B	yeah and I think every so often they do these recruitments
A	right
B	and she was now onto the third stage so she got called for an actual like a day
A	yeah
B	but we have a holiday process where you have to give in any holiday erm requests at a certain of time before
A	oh okay
B	and she was like asking for it last week for this week and it was bank holiday week and she just thought it'll be declined but anyway she spoke to me and I just said
A	oh she told you it was an interview?
B	yeah
A	she didn't try and hide that?
B	well she told
A	oh okay
B	and then I just said can I have five minutes with you? so I said look it's just best to be honest and open because I said if you just don't if you ring in sick and anybody finds out
A	yes
B	you know
A	yeah it's just awkward
B	so just tell me what it's about so she did I went to
A	yeah
B	long term she wants to do this so we made it possible for her to have the day off which was yesterday I texted her wished her well she text me halfway through the day and went oh I'm halfway through now
A	oh gosh
B	I look forward to hearing about it tomorrow come in today I said morning how did you get on yesterday? she went oh I'll tell you about it later and then I heard her say to
A	right
B	and at one o'clock she's going on her lunch I'm just sort of finishing stuff off and erm I didn't even know it was her cos normally she'll go that way but somebody came behind me and literally just threw a letter like it went like you know this
B	just landed and I went
A	how rude
B	I I went oh and then I couldn't see who it was and
A	that is rude
B	so I said I said who was it? he said it was
A	how weird
B	and she'd just just
A	and she won't have heard from the job yet you don't think?
B	well I've got a feeling
A	so
B	no
A	oh
B	because she was going on lunch one till two and
A	and then you were finishing
B	I was due I was due to leave at half past one but then I had to take this letter to
A	yeah
B	and then I've talked to her about it and I've said oh not I can't delve into it I don't you don't have to tell me all about it but obviously as your manager I need to support you and if you need time from work or whatever it is given the the twenty-four hour help number for employee assistance helpline you know all this sort of thing
A	all that yeah
B	so I've stood by her and erm as I say made it possible
A	that's
B	for her to go to this interview
A	so rude
B	but it was more the way she didn't
A	yeah
B	say to me
A	didn't speak to you threw it at you
B	no
A	didn't give you
B	no so I had to go and speak to
A	is she on two months' notice then? May June
B	erm
A	that's quite a long notice period
B	I'm just saying the twenty-sixth of June
A	maybe it was May
B	I knew it should be four weeks from
A	oh so
B	today really so whatever that is
A	start of June
B	in June
A	yeah
B	maybe it was the second of June
A	fourth of June
B	I can't
A	fifth sixth of June
B	I'm sure it was a double number anyway
A	that
B	I can't remember I can't remember
A	you were in shock I think
B	well I just thought I expected
A	so did you speak to
B	no no
A	ah
B	it's a nice day and it's hot and that would just be really nice for a treat so
A	oh so
B	I was
A	well so now you're not gonna know anything till Monday?
B	well I spoke to
A	or will
B	and she just said this is rude
A	yeah
B	and out of order and she said I accept this resignation and she said you need to get off and go erm but and she said but I'll speak to her this afternoon but she said I'll tell her that the way that she delivered this was just unacceptable
A	yeah
B	and especially in view of all the support that you've given her in the recent weeks it's just
A	oh
B	out of order
A	that's not a very nice way for you end the week is it?
B	well not really but then erm and five minutes later
B	because we can't we can't wait for
A	can't function
A	yeah yeah
B	and get them trained
A	yeah
B	in this four weeks so erm
A	gosh
B	I'll speak to
A	yeah
B	done it now
A	I would think so
B	but she had a face on her all morning and I said I wouldn't be surprised if she's told
A	she's just
B	I'm having a change I'm not working here
A	yeah yeah
B	if I can't do that I'm gonna do something else because if the day had gone really well she would have
A	she'd have been in a happy mood
B	yeah
A	and she'd have been
B	and if she'd have been offered the job she would have resigned saying I thank you for your support
A	for your support yes yeah
B	letting me go yesterday and I was successful in in gaining the position
A	in getting it yes
B	and you know I've enjoyed my time with you but
A	not just say I don't like working here any more
B	yeah
A	no
B	it just said er yeah I've decided I don't like it here any more
B	since the takeover two weeks ago on your PDR you were telling us da-da-da-da a week later you're telling us your dream come true of being an airline hostess was coming to fruition and now
A	it is a strange dream isn't it?
B	you're leaving
A	mm
B	she looks like cabin crew she'd she'd do really well
A	yeah oh
B	well I she wants
A	I wouldn't know where I was
B	her dad works in Florida all the time
A	oh
B	she's just been to Florida for two weeks
A	so
B	with him he was on business but she went along with him
A	mm
B	the they spend three weeks in Florida as a family every year anyway
A	oh
B	so erm she loves
A	probably yes yeah
B	the long
A	oh
B	haul flights and
A	Virgin's the one she'd wanna be with then I suppose
B	yeah
A	isn't it they
B	when she first
A	yeah
B	came for an interview with us probably two and a half years ago erm I think one of the questions was who inspires you and she said Richard Branson and she talked about him then er and Virgin and that her long term goal was to be you know cabin crew
A	oh okay
B	going backwards and forwards to America or long haul flights so you know we've always known that about her
A	yes yeah
B	and in our company we don't sort of say well we don't want them because
A	as yeah yeah
B	because we're quite you know I'm old in the team and erm
B	we're a young company in terms of we recruit quite young people and
A	yes
B	we believe in erm
A	training
B	to yeah
A	developing them
B	developing them
A	yeah
B	and
A	yeah
B	developing and retaining we'd rather retain them but also if we know that somebody is young then they probably have got
A	mm
B	other prospects and we're not gonna
A	yes yeah
B	hold that against them
A	oh well interesting times
B	so it just
A	then oh
B	delayed me
A	er yes
B	it delayed me you know
A	I've been getting a bit of hay fever today do you get that?
B	no
A	oh today
B	no
A	I even took a tablet actually lunchtime which is the first one this year
B	is it bad you sitting outside then?
A	no no no cos I've taken a
B	mm
A	no it makes no difference
B	well do you know what?
A	oh cos of the snoring?
B	yeah
A	was he snoring again?
B	last night
A	mm
B	but I felt bad for him
A	oh yes
B	he always does that
A	I forgot his does that what so he was there all day?
B	he was up at half five yeah got home about eleven
A	what a shame cos it was such a nice day
B	I know but he was
A	oh
B	and then he wanted to go to bed I came in after my auditions all absolutely full of everything that had happened which was
A	yeah
B	another drama everything went wrong last night
A	oh really?
B	and he was just nodding off to sleep but then he was snoring
A	oh
B	and in the end
A	god
B	about quarter to two I was sat up in bed and said I'm gonna do what you did the other night I'm gonna go downstairs and he went no I'll go cos it's my fault I said no cos you've had the tough day I'll go and he went I've gone already
A	ah
B	but he came back at
A	does he sleep when he's on the sofa?
B	yeah I said did you get any sleep and he said yeah and he said better because you weren't prodding me
A	yeah
B	so
A	and making him turn over
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	and but he's he what he worries is that erm if he stays there till the morning the boys wake up and come downstairs and find him on the sofa they're gonna think we've fallen out
A	oh really?
A	why can't he just say I was snoring?
B	no well he said to
A	oh is he?
B	all like
A	he spreads out into it
B	yeah and then if he senses that anyone's in bed with him he
A	oh gosh
B	and it's he's and he's so bony and
A	yeah
B	thing and it's just not comfortable
A	oh no what a nightmare
B	and so I know so
B	yeah but it was like probably would have been two three four five
A	oh gosh
B	but
A	oh okay
B	that was all
A	that yes
A	yeah yeah yeah yeah and it might be it has been
B	mm
A	it's got warm the sun's come out yeah
B	fortunately touch wood I know things change I've never nothing
A	never had it
B	I've ever suffered with no
A	oh good
B	cos I just feel so
A	well that's alright cos you do have enough to deal with
B	probably yeah
A	yeah
B	something like that
A	so what happened at rehearsals?
B	well
A	yes yeah
B	and erm my friend
A	stalker
B	yeah
A	stalker
B	yes
A	as opposed to stalker
B	yes but
B	yeah
A	to the
B	yeah
A	how did he know where to go?
B	well
A	how does he know where
B	no it wasn't
A	I thought oh have I got
B	so
A	the wrong date? Wednesday
B	no
A	was at
B	so Wednesday some
A	oh god
B	and three people contacted me and said we can't audition Thursday so we give them an opportunity to audition on another night but it has to be prior to the final
A	oh okay
B	audition
A	so you just
B	so
A	have one night of auditions then it's like you choose everyone there and then do you? on that
B	yeah and if you can't
A	usually oh okay
B	you have to go away and ring round and maybe think about it but I was able to choose last night not the
A	oh okay right I was getting confused
B	but Thursday
A	was the actual auditions
B	was in the back room of the
A	so what did he know you were there?
B	well he must have done
A	stalker
B	he must have done because I think I'm had a conversation with them when they came to see my play about the next play
A	oh okay
B	and all this kind of thing and
A	no
B	but he was obviously lapping it all up taking it all in
A	he's probably phoned the pub and asked them when the auditions are taking place
B	oh no
A	probably has
B	probably
[ANNOTATION]	Someone made a call to the hospital.	Contradiction
A	put that past him
B	probably I don't now but that's
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B played in a soccer match.	Contradiction
A	and it's all a bit
B	the yeah that's not till ten that bit doesn't happen till quarter past ten but erm so other
B	I will call people in I said look
A	oh okay
B	and then when one person finished for an audition I'd say shall I see if there's more Siobhans want to come in and audition? so then they go through anyone else want to audition for Siobhan? so it didn't quite work out
A	right yeah yeah
B	so
A	oh
B	so
A	well he would be three hours of drinking
B	I said I'm sorry I didn't there wasn't any reading in for you to do cos I said there wasn't a lot of men reading in to do no fine I've had a brilliant night I've had a brilliant night and I said I was hoping that you sort of herd people in you know but I said when
B	if you'd have
[ANNOTATION]	50 people went to the audition.	Entailment
A	that's so childish
B	if you'd have wanted to do it you should have not sat down with a pint of
A	of beer
B	of beer you know
A	yeah yeah
B	so I was like boys it's alright anyway erm
[ANNOTATION]	Many males were reading .	Contradiction
A	oh yes
B	Bertie Wooster in Jeeves and Wooster
A	yes yes
B	with the mad curly hair
A	yes yes I know him
B	and everything
A	yeah
B	he came and auditioned
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Bertie Wooster did not attend the auditions.	Contradiction
B	and erm
A	how many people were you looking for?
B	well
A	how many is in the cast?
B	it's er you can do it as a small version or as an ensemble version so the small version has five ladies and one man and
A	mm
B	they all play all the different roles because I wanted to open it up more and give more people opportunity I did the ensemble version that has potential for more roles where you get
A	yeah yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Someone didn't want to provide a lot of opportunities.	Contradiction
B	so I said we'll do that version just to give a few more opportunities
A	right
B	erm but
A	yeah
B	it's quite noisy and
A	stalker
B	and I was like
A	so he knew did how did you know that they knew each other?
B	no so anyway so they were having this chat da-da-da-da and I said
A	was
B	himself so
A	oh
B	and he was really
A	spookier and spookier
B	he was really dressed up smart and I thought oh and erm so I I
A	oh did
B	so
B	are you alright? so I said you know who that is talking to
A	what's he doing here?
A	blimey
B	oh gosh was it that obvious? so anyway
B	you know well done for tonight and we'll be in touch you and I we've got to have some meetings and all of this and I it's like oh yeah yeah like this anyway
A	theatrical
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	he erm give me this big hug and he went I'm so happy to be in this play it's gonna be such fun
A	oh they didn't know each
B	no so I said
B	he he's seen you in plays he went is that what it is? because he said he walked straight over to me pats me on the back shakes me by the hand hi
A	really?
B	yeah
A	so he didn't know him? that's weird
B	so I said I can't tell you now I can't tell you now I can't tell you now I'll tell you when I said
A	oh my goodness
B	so
A	that is freaky
B	then
A	I'm worried for you
A	I'm not gonna lie
A	which
B	so he's got this pint so he said I've been to see my dad and it's erm
A	who needed a hug?
B	no his dad
A	oh
B	so I said why didn't you give him one? and he said well I tried to but it's not really me he needs one from it's my mum but she won't acknowledge anything so she just talks as if everything's normal and he said but it's not really while we're there that he needs a hug it's in the middle of the night when he wakes up frightened and upset and there's just like a strange nurse there you know so he's telling me all of this and I just thought do you know I think he's just he's really upset and I don't think
A	picks his moments doesn't he? when you're in the middle of that with er you know auditions that's just
B	well I was with all my friends
B	and they're obviously wondering
A	he must have he he's gone to the trouble to
B	I mean it's quite brave isn't it?
A	it is he's gone to the trouble to find out where you're doing it and when he knows it's the pub he's rung them up found out when they're on
B	I don't no I don't know about that
A	I do absolutely
B	I haven't I didn't ask him I didn't
A	absolutely
B	ask him I didn't even ask him I didn't even say what are you doing here? because I'd just
A	and did he go?
B	yeah so he drank his beer really quickly and he said erm
A	oh okay yeah don't let on where
B	somewhere else he doesn't know where they are so and the rehearsals on Thursday are somewhere else as well so erm
A	so just going back to what you were saying the other day did you actually tell him you weren't interested romantically? or are you interested romantically?
B	no I'm not
A	okay
A	I just wanted to confirm that with you
B	just to make that clear
A	clear for the tape
B	for the
A	erm so did you make it clear to him that you weren't?
B	I
A	very very kind to him considering everything that he's done
A	you well I know that and you've always been nice to him and you've always listened to him but I think you might need to erm
B	we've had
A	well spell it out really from the sounds of it
B	we've had a lot of
A	so does he not accept the fact that you don't want an affair with him?
B	no no
A	he thinks seems to think that's
B	he won't accept it and he wants to talk me into it and
B	it was based on the fact that why should anybody need to know and you can have your cake and you can eat it and you know who invented monogamy anyway? it's a manmade rule and now he's found out that the pope had a friend who was a lady
A	oh
B	and all of that did I tell you that?
A	yes but it yes you did but if you're not interested romantically you're not interested that's where it has to end and that's what I think you're
A	gonna need to push home to him
B	in his mind though we're not I've told you I think I think I told you this when I say to him and it was funny because I just just telling you hi
A	oh I couldn't
B	first thing I said was hi
A	I know did you did you see my laugh?
A	cos I just couldn't I was
A	that I'd laughed but it was just because of what you'd said
B	I know
A	before of that
B	and I said it on purpose because that's what
A	I know you did and that's what made me laugh and I'm thinking
B	and that's what
A	oh I hope he didn't see me cos his answer was dying
B	and that's what I always say
A	mm
B	you know hi how was your day? and I do ask him and I I feel disloyal to
A	that kiss was weird wasn't it that they had?
B	what kiss?
A	oh you see you didn't notice
B	no
A	and I'm sure it was for your benefit you know they were talking behind us and
B	I didn't really notice no
A	we were talking there they never kiss in public I've never seen them and he kissed her either hello or goodbye or something
B	they don't kiss each other full stop
A	no I know so I thought
B	according to him
A	I thought to myself that's for
B	I
A	I can't believe you missed it
B	I didn't even notice it
A	how did you not notice it?
B	I don't know but I had a I had a text from him shortly after he left and it said I'm really sorry that I
A	so now he's using your dad as common ground to make
B	well I just said
A	mm
B	I just I text back and said and he said I hope your auditions
A	oh
B	popped out so
A	let yourself in yes
B	let yourself in
A	yeah
B	so I
A	yeah yeah
B	and or
A	he meant let yourself in the house
B	yeah in the house and
A	and they
B	you know
A	yeah I know I know
B	and all of it but I don't know whether
A	well he appears to be erm
B	he's trying to get in with them ingratiate himself in my social life
A	what's his best friend that's so weird
B	I'll go back to that but erm I just
A	mm mm
B	not offended at all erm
A	I think you're gonna need to be a bit more
B	well for ages I've not answered his texts I haven't engaged in any conversation
A	what are you gonna do on Wednesday? cos I can't I won't be there are you gonna run with him if he asks?
B	I I don't really want to
A	you're gonna have to make an excuse and be somewhere else you're gonna have to drop him off and go aren't you? you can run in a different place
B	somewhere else
A	well yes otherwise it's just gonna get awkward for you if you don't want to
B	I just think I'm just wary now because if I say it's alright to run and then it's just me that turns up then it looks like I'm giving an invitation to be alright with this
A	yes yeah
B	because
A	I don't think I would run with him by myself if I were you
B	I mean I've
A	mm
B	which he joined with
A	yeah
B	cycle but he couldn't run and he didn't like the triathlon running coach so that's why I took
A	mm
B	so I used to just go on Mondays and obviously not see him wait for the triathlon to finish get in do my swim now he's come back to it like he said to me he wrote on this letter or did he wrote a letter or text me? I can't remember and just said erm I know you want to see me because you're coming swimming on a Monday night and I was like I've swum for years on a Monday night I don't come to see you and he said well the fact that you were there waiting to get in when we get out he said you could easily have come five minutes later so the next week I went later
A	oh
B	cos I just thought if that's what he thinks
A	he's reading stuff into all sorts of things
B	into
A	that's not there isn't he?
B	stuff that I just do normally
A	yeah yeah
B	so that's my worry I'm being
B	mm I just er you said you've been nice and considering that he's done all of this but I think you know somewhere along the line I'm obviously partially to blame because I've been too friendly and
A	well no I don't think you're partially to blame I think that you need to appreciate that he's made his feelings clear that he wants more than friendship
B	mm
B	yeah
A	you haven't done anything wrong he needs to back off
B	he gave he's given me a necklace
B	no I I
A	when did he give it you?
B	Christmas
A	is it an expensive one?
B	it's erm I don't know it's in a box it's got a butterfly and two little diamond four diamonds in it
A	diamonds?
B	little tiny little
A	are they diamonds actual diamonds?
B	erm well I don't know it's all marked I don't know erm but diamond
A	did you open it on front of the family?
B	no no
A	you see that's slightly alarming
B	no
A	why not?
A	why not?
A	a peace offering for what?
B	for all the upset that he'd caused I need to go back a bit really don't I? I feel bad cos I've told you too much already but erm
A	has he caused you a lot of upset?
B	yeah yeah because because he hasn't taken no for an answer and then he said
A	well he's still not then is he?
B	no he isn't but I think he's in a mess you see I think he's in a really bad mess and erm
A	he does sound a little bit unstable I'd be a bit concerned if I were you
B	last
A	gifts and flowers and letters and
B	yeah
A	texts and turning up now at the thing I would be a little bit concerned
B	well I am concerned but I'm concerned as to what his and I
A	a stalker
B	yeah doing
B	really bizarre and then sending a really nasty horrible text to me and then sending a really nice text and then and and then and I just ignore them all and then he
A	mm
B	a few times
A	yeah
B	we're having these big conversations and and then
A	oh is that the time he didn't want to get out the car cos he said you'll just go and talk to
B	yeah and you'll
A	and then you'll leave me out?
B	yeah yeah
A	like some sort of child
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah no no my husband just thinks he's weird he always has done
B	well I think he's right
A	and I'm not gonna tell him anything
A	it really annoys me I think
B	but
A	oh my goodness no he'd just would think really badly of
B	because erm
A	cos he's a bit black and white
B	and because also
A	but it doesn't want
B	I'm stupid I am
A	no you're not stupid
B	I am stupid
A	but he calls it he does I don't know how he does that he's always said it right from the start from the minute we met him
B	but I you know you used to tease me and say it and I'd say no no no no no I used to think where have they got this from where have they got this from? if I'm perfectly honest last this happened this started last July because it was you can't believe the timing of it in the very week that
A	mm
B	and we were at the
A	right
B	in that very same week and I've got all of that stuff going on
A	is that last July is that the play that I got the
B	yeah yeah
A	that's never last July that
B	yeah
A	I think
B	it is
A	that's really
B	can you believe it? it's nearly a year ago
A	no I can't actually
B	this time last year we were rehearsing it and erm it was part of the
A	they'll take his name out don't you worry
B	okay erm chose to declare his feelings and decided to cycle to
A	in front of anyone?
B	no just in front of me
A	oh
B	but he didn't realise that the cycle ride was so long and he didn't get there on time
A	that's hilarious
A	so
B	erm
A	oh okay
B	is that you?
A	no
B	the ring?
A	it was you
B	right let me just see what this says
A	so when
B	happened
A	did he tell you then? if he missed you at that point after cycling all the way to
B	he well he'd
A	oh I remember you telling me that
A	yes
B	and and then he said something to me in that car and I was like horrified and got out of the car and then
A	what did he say?
B	that just basically that he thought that we should you know have an affair together
B	and I got out of the car and he sent me a text the next day and said I'm never gonna let you ever sit in my car again and erm you teased me by sitting in my car
B	wearing stockings how would anybody know that? how would anybody know that?
A	were you?
B	well they were pull holdups pull up
A	how well
B	so I
A	you
B	but I wasn't that was the that was that was yeah okay I'm partly to blame because I just thought this is ludicrous what is this? where has this all sprung from?
B	this is just out of nowhere and I was just like I
B	over everything else and that was all that I could focus on and I was just like what? in the middle of all of this?
A	yeah yeah
B	what how dare you?
A	which he didn't know about did he?
B	oh absolutely not so erm
A	oh my goodness no I didn't mean that you're not partly to blame
B	well I am
A	you're not
A	I didn't mean that erm
B	because I thought I could sort it out you see so then he
A	so but you haven't
B	told me that he'd erm
A	oh god
B	and I I thought the performance would probably nearly be finished
A	oh
B	meet him for a serious talk on that Friday and I just said to him
A	no you see you've phrased that wrong because that gave him a hope that
B	well I probably didn't say it in that order
A	I should hope you didn't because that would give him an
B	I probably didn't say it in that order
A	if other things hadn't happened you'd say yes
B	no because I didn't
A	okay
B	I didn't
A	as long as you're sure you didn't
B	because he told me I'd stuck a dagger between his ribs and
A	oh
B	punctured his heart
B	so whatever I said
B	I'd obviously made it clear
A	oh good
B	but but basically
A	okay okay
B	because I knew everything that had gone happened with
B	that risking another friendship that involved children and something much bigger just wasn't even worth it it just wasn't even worth the thought of it whether I'd wanted to or not it just wasn't even worth it and I had to I just had to make that really really clear but then I suppose
A	so since then so for nine months he hasn't taken no for an answer?
B	no because obviously then I was poorly I was signed off work
A	mm
B	then these flowers arrived saying erm I'm sorry that you're ill
A	did you know they were from him then secretly?
B	no no
A	did you think?
B	no no but I
A	did you
B	no because I didn't even consider that and because I hadn't had really had any contact with
A	does
B	not now cos it's all water under the bridge
A	I know that but I yeah
B	he's not there's no
A	so he doesn't know anything?
B	I've told him
A	bad behaviour?
B	I've told him
A	that's what it is
A	so that's what he thinks?
B	what
A	and that is what's happened
B	yeah and
A	cut him off sort of thing
B	yeah
A	yeah no I can understand that
B	and because I've always said look whatever we need to get over this awkwardness because we need to be
A	they're the boys
B	normal
A	are on the same team and all this
B	we can't suddenly be
A	but he obviously hasn't and he's getting worse
B	and if
A	secretly you're in love with me
B	you've just laughed at me criticised me made fun of me teased me so I never got that impression and I said whenever you say something to me you say it in a riddle
A	that's like what that's that's what children children do though isn't it?
B	yeah
A	when they fancy someone
B	yeah
A	they're mean to them
B	yeah exactly
A	that's what children do when they're
B	but I said to him I'm a talker and I tell people how I feel and I said I don't speak in riddles and I said you have just spoken to me just in riddles and I don't understand what you're saying and you're saying oh you were obviously saying something to me that I'm just not getting and I take it
B	on
A	face value
B	face value
A	mm
B	of what it what you actually mean and and obviously there's some
A	mm
B	if you if you
A	yes but you know
B	exactly
A	it just wouldn't think twice about it because
B	so say if
A	oh yeah yeah absolutely
B	to
A	I'd find that particularly weird but I
B	what
A	probably would tell
B	see
A	occurred to me because it would never happen hasn't
B	well it
A	happened but I can see the
B	you're put in that
A	the similarity that
B	sort of terrible situation
A	yes yeah
B	where this is a family
A	family friends
B	friend and
A	I know where the kids are friends and everything but erm
B	yeah and it's just disappointing
A	but I mean the whole if he hasn't he hasn't taken no for an answer the flowers the gift at Christmas that's a bit
B	so I said I'm not gonna
B	and I've said like that's the furthest away from a description of me furthest away but I can't enter into any communication with you because every time I do it leads you believe
A	yeah
B	that there's some hope
A	something different
B	and er I have to tell you though that there isn't and he said well you know you're obviously not happy with
A	oh had it?
B	yeah
A	oh thoughtful
B	it was and it was all about the person who loves no matter what erm no matter what happens will not be swayed from their position so the object of your affection whether they change course whether they put a wall up whether they say no because that because the lover truly loves they won't we dissuaded from it and that's what this sonnet was about it's a famous one
A	mm
B	and he said his heart was like a a dry desert and
A	look you don't think about that
A	of an engineer do you?
B	and so so
A	I mean he's an engineer isn't he?
B	but this is what I said to him I've got
A	that's just
B	no idea
A	not what you
B	I have got no idea because I said you're so guarded you don't show any emotion you don't show you know and I said like I say I I say oh I'm excited I'm really annoyed I'm upset about this da-da-da-da in all of our times running together talking walking whatever just lifts or stuff I'm just articulate it all and I'm not saying I'm right and he's wrong but what I've said to him is
A	but that's just how people are and then so how would you know from him?
B	how could I have guessed?
A	yeah
B	how could I have possibly guessed from how you are that all of this was going on inside you and why have you suddenly
A	so did you
B	picked now?
A	say to him that you'd got the card?
B	so he text me a few days or so after and said he said you either obviously never received the cards and the flowers or you didn't like them
A	oh
B	or you've just chosen to ignore it I purposefully made sure that things arrived so that erm
A	mm
B	like I say then there was this erm pope thing and I was at the auction at
A	oh no
B	and I've said you know you criticise everything that's at the core of what I stand for and you know er that's horrible because it's like criticising me and everything I believe in so you say that you love me but actually you don't love what's the essence of me at all you love what you think that I can be for you which I can't be so actually
B	this is me and if it doesn't fit with what you want then actually you don't love me you don't and you certainly don't understand me so I just text him after all of this stuff at the auction and I just said all you were doing is winding yourself up more and more and more I'm at an auction I cannot text you back I will respond in full to every miniscule point that you have made in these constant reams of text so just get ready and literally
B	you know when your text won't go any further? I've
A	no no I've never got that far
B	okay well mine have and I filled up and filled up and filled up and filled up and I just went and another thing and another thing and another thing and another thing and another thing
A	it must have taken you hours to write
B	it did and then he text back and said I think you'll forgive me for not responding to all of that and I said yeah but you can never criticise me again for not because he criticised me for he's
A	and it's cos he wants them reciprocated and if you're not
B	I know
A	prepared to reciprocate them he needs to learn to back off
B	so when I was poorly
A	I think you oh
B	he said I'll take you on a picnic I'll take you to the theatre so he said to me it's what's hurt me more than anything is when you were poorly you wouldn't let me help and he said erm other people he said you know you did exercise classes with
B	he said you know who who are these people? and I said to him these people are people that I've known for years for thirty odd years some of them and I said who I know really well I said we've been through all sorts of
A	mm
B	we've been through each other's marriages people's parents dying our babies being born you know all of this
A	yeah you can't just wipe all that out oh no
B	you know who know me really well
A	so are you you should be
B	and I said
A	I do
B	I am alarmed and I said to him I erm the reason that I can spend time with them is because they're not the root of my problem I said they are actually I can go and talk to
A	mm
B	walk that he's planning on the isle of Skye and I said and it cheers me up I said er I come and talk to you and it's all about why don't you love me? why won't you love me and all this sort of thing and he and I said and it just churns me up I'm supposed to be getting better and he said I feel I am partly responsible for you being poorly and not sleeping well and I said well you are because I said how can I recover when you you're putting all of this on me? and in the end
B	that's
A	hallelujah
B	I wouldn't and he said there's somebody else because he said all you've said to me on and on and on is I've got first-hand experience that anything like this goes ends in tears so he said you you've obviously you've obviously had a situation I said yeah
A	oh you didn't tell him did you?
B	yeah but not in detail so I said to him cos he told me loads and loads of stuff and I'd just in that moment in time
A	you know he'll hold that against you when it all comes out that he's he's suffering with his unrequited love?
B	well it probably will and he'll probably
A	he probably will hold that against you
B	but he doesn't know
A	you have to be careful
B	he doesn't know any details nobody can say anything he doesn't know any who these people are
A	mm
B	and erm but I just said to
A	oh okay
B	we can't even be friends and he said so you say like you've talked to him what other things have you done with this guy? and I said that really is none of your business and I really resent you asking me that what I'm trying to make the point is he thought his wife knew nothing about me
A	yeah yeah
B	wasn't in my circle of friends I wasn't in hers as far as she was concerned he was off rehearsing
A	mm
B	and I said but she obviously knows his pattern of doing things knows what time he should get back every time he'd had a rehearsal he'd stayed for a drink that probably wasn't in his normal
A	right yeah
B	pattern of things so she thought who's in that play?
A	mm mm
B	four people
B	you know and he he she knew that it she knew
A	mm
B	she didn't actually have any proof cos there was none really to have but she just on the off chance thought she'd challenge him and he was obviously
A	yeah yeah
B	taken off guard and erm so I said you know
A	yeah
B	probably why you know and erm so all I said to him what I'm saying is that I've got personal experience because I said I've lost a really really
A	mm
B	good friend who I I said er I I loved with all my heart and I said it really really upsets me and it really upsets him that we can't even have that normal friendship now and I said I don't want that to happen to us you are prepared to jeopardise a nice friendship that we had
A	mm
B	for for a
A	fling yeah
B	that that you know and he just said I don't know who this guy is but if he if he knew how valuable your friendship was he would have done this and he would have done that and he would have
A	he's no oh
B	and I said I haven't told you this so you can start criticising another of my friends and he said well it's quite apparent that you you know that you really love this other person and I said I do and I miss his friendship so but you don't need to know about that I said but I don't want to be in the same situation with you you know where
A	mm mm
B	and I said and it's worse because our children are friends I said his children and my children don't know each other but our children are friends and you know oh well not going anywhere
A	how's it gonna end? where do you see this going?
B	oh
A	how er I where what do you think
B	so
A	is gonna happen?
B	he has said as a result of all of this he's come to a new way of thinking so three weeks three Fridays ago I met him for a cup of tea at
A	yeah
B	face to face with him
A	yeah
B	and I just thought I know how upset I feel when
A	yeah but that's different
B	respond to him it is different
A	cos the two of you felt the same about each other
B	it is different
A	you two don't so
B	and that
A	completely different it is completely different
B	completely different so anyway erm I met him for this cup of tea and he sat down in the chair and I sat down and he and then he moved to sit next to me and I went like this
B	and my body language was like this and he was like you can sit closer you know and I said I don't want to
A	good for you
B	I want to sit here so I said I don't want to
A	is this before or after the incident after the pool?
B	I can't remember same week maybe can't remember I can't remember anyway I can't remember
A	a life sentence?
B	yeah
A	that's how he described his marriage that's a shame isn't it?
B	I know and he said it's time now that I had
A	get release
B	something for me a bit of love and affection and he said and I thought that you could be the person and then the more I've got to know you then the more I thought that and
B	that actually what I shouldn't be doing is holding the family together and living in a marriage that's miserable I should be addressing the problem and sorting them out and making plans to split up really this is all I shouldn't be saying all of this
A	oh well no well I'm not gonna tell anyone
B	this is
A	yeah no I wouldn't say
B	this is what I mean you won't trust me now to you won't tell me anything now about ever if you needed to you'll think I won't speak to
A	cos she'll pass it on no I won't think that
B	tell it to someone else
A	I won't think that
B	because this because obviously this it's
A	confidential er yeah no but is he actually gonna go with it?
B	well I've got no idea but what he's obviously come to thinking that
A	mm
B	and what he's thought is he needs someone in his life to give him some love and affection that is missing and I've made it clear that it isn't me but what everything that I've said to him and I've given him some home truths about I don't expect everybody I know to be like one of my lovely drama friends showing it all on their sleeve
A	no
B	I said but I I you know I've said to him said I can't nobody can read you nobody you've got these feelings but you don't say them to anybody
A	to to yeah yeah
B	and he said he's been brought up to just get on and manage himself and to push feelings inside and
A	mm
B	it was always expected you didn't show these feelings and his aunt has always said about him you're a cold one
A	lots of people lots of British people are like that though
B	yeah and that
B	yeah he's he's just out there isn't he?
A	completely repressed that man
B	but
A	yes
B	so you'll understand a little bit of that
A	but no yes yeah yeah
B	so he's been brought up to know that never had a good relationship with his dad never had a proper conversation
A	mm
B	doesn't know how his dad ticks and now his dad's dying and he's got massive regrets because he didn't really know his dad only as a person to shake hands with doesn't really know him at all and
A	do you know what?
B	it's too late
A	it's weird it's quite similar to
B	is it?
A	well
B	yeah
A	from a really young age never really
B	mm
A	so mm
B	and did his dad die before or did he move from boarding school to university and then like that?
A	oh no
B	right
A	and he went to as a day boy they called it
B	were they split up then?
A	no no no
B	oh
A	they were still together but
B	mm
A	he was only young he came back so his mum came back
B	mm
A	and in term time she lived in Southend
B	right
A	and he went to his day
B	yeah
A	every holiday they'd fly back to where his dad was
B	yeah
A	until he went back to boarding school at about thirteen
B	right
A	and when she went back abroad
B	yeah
A	for good
B	and he used to fly back then to see them didn't he?
A	he used to fly back in er all the holidays so and then he went off to college and then
B	uhu
A	got a job and then his dad
B	yeah
A	but of course by then he was in his
B	a grown up man with his own
A	you know yeah twenty sort of thing
B	own life
A	yes and wasn't about to move back home so he didn't really ever live with his dad so it's not that there was ever any bad feeling or he didn't
B	yeah
A	feel like he knew him it's so it's not similar
B	yeah
A	to
B	I understand
A	but but he didn't he never I remember him saying to me he never really felt like he had a close relationship
B	yeah
A	because he'd never lived with him
B	mm
A	and was at boarding school so he was never
B	yeah
A	stiff upper lip type of attitude
B	yeah
A	erm but I don't think he's as he's not
B	no he isn't like that at all er he is not like that well I don't know he him well enough but
A	no he's not
B	from what I
A	he's not
B	get from him he's not like that at all but in all of this that's happened maybe the only good thing that's come out is that our friendship maybe will be preserved on some
A	mm
B	formal level but that that
A	somebody so he do you think do you think? I dunno you say all that
A	but it wasn't erm it didn't seem like he'd moved on on
B	no
A	only what? last night?
B	Wednesday night oh last night oh sorry when he turned up
A	yeah was that
B	yeah
A	just last night?
B	yeah so
A	mm
B	we had this talk anyway and I said to him I'm glad that you've done this thing here and that you've he he said he feels at a calmer place now and that he felt like the old proverb of the wind and the sun and I was like the man walking along in the coat and he was the wind and the harder he blew the tighter I've put the coat around and that as soon as the sun came out the coat would come off and he he'd done this thinking and then I said to him this is like the first bit of sense that you've spoken for a long time and he said I'm glad as painful as it's been that you've come to this understanding
A	you know what he's gonna hope for though don't you? he's gonna hope that if he backs off a little bit and tells you that he's taking that approach that eventually you'll come round to your own way of thinking and tell him
B	no cos I've made it quite clear cos in that conversation I said to him but I said I hope in saying this that you haven't got this in your head that I am that person
A	okay
B	so I said if whatever decision you and
A	mm
B	and that'll be really you know potentially really sad erm but you will make it for your own reasons and I said you've explained those now and I said and I feel confident that you're clear in your head about those
A	right okay
B	I said but I have to make it clear to you that do not be doing anything along those lines
A	on my account
B	on my account because I will not be waiting for that to happen
A	mm mm
B	and I will not be that person to give you that
A	and do you think he took that on board?
B	well he said he did because then he talked about erm just not really knowing where to look for anybody else you know how he would possibly meet anybody else
A	he's still married he's got a lot to get through first
B	well and yeah
A	mm
B	and
A	no no no
B	quite upsetting
A	I don't
B	and erm but then he said it er I said look I need to go because I said erm said you're not gonna like this but going to see
B	and I need to go and do some shopping first of all so he said can we meet again? and I said I don't know really if it's necessary he said there's a couple of things that I've thought about that I still haven't spoken to you and I need to
A	mm
A	mm
B	are you available next Friday? and I said no because it's the play next Friday and I said I don't want the pressure and it I just don't so he said okay I'm not gonna pester you and say what about that Friday and what about that Friday he said I'll leave it to you when you feel ready that your feel you can have a normal chat with me
A	mm mm
B	you let me know so it's like okay great so then his
A	but that hasn't been the case
B	no
A	has it?
B	he and
A	oh yeah you said yeah
B	she text me and said you know we're in
A	just having a normal conversation
B	talked I said you know I like her I've always liked her I said she's done bonkers things but I kind of understand now why I said I didn't handle her I said that's not what people do you know I just talked to her
A	no just talked to her be normal
B	anyway we walked
A	he does sound like he's got a few issues
B	they went she was driving they walked off to their car and went home and that was it that was the end of it and then he text me the following week and said you were brilliant in the play and erm let me know on Friday where you want to meet because I want you to see most receptive and comfortable to everything I've got to say
B	so I just messaged back and said oh erm I've got a meeting on Friday
A	was that last Friday cos we were yes we were gonna get together weren't we?
B	so I said I've got a meeting on Friday and then I got this whole tirade of texts then saying well I hope you're going to change that meeting and whoever has the meeting on a Friday afternoon and whatever is discussed won't be remembered by Monday just ignored it then he came back and said what is this meeting anyway? just ignored it and then he came back and said are you moving this meeting? so then I text him and said I will not be moving this meeting somebody is coming especially from Birmingham to have this meeting and if all goes well it will be a really successful and important meeting to have and then he
B	and I just ignored it because I decided I
A	so he hasn't learnt anything?
B	I was putting that tone of voice onto those texts because actually the text might have been like what you've arranged a meeting for a Friday afternoon?
A	yeah
B	cor I hope you can change this meeting
A	yeah yeah
B	you know and it could have been much more upbeat so I thought I'm not gonna respond because maybe I'm
A	oh the sarky sod
B	and I er I said to him well you know when I see you I'll tell you about it if you like
A	in hospital yeah
B	er he said it was really really bad
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A thinks cancelling a meeting is always a big deal.	Neutral
A	well they were kissing at the football field
B	well I didn't see it
A	that's just that was for your benefit I think
B	never seen them kiss before ever
A	no that's why it stuck out with my and I thought
B	she told him off at a Christmas party because he
A	I was gonna send you a message about it but my phone's a little bit public property so I didn't like to write it you know
B	oh
A	in my house
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A saw someone fighting in a football field.	Contradiction
A	so I didn't like to write anything down about it
B	but apparently last night he'd been to the hospital and he'd been to
A	oh okay
B	I don't know I don't know about anyway he
A	well mm
B	when
A	I I don't think he's really
B	I can't remember I can't remember anyway but he turned up there but the hilarious bit was that obviously he's seen
A	mm
B	and
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B's friend has been at the hospital for months.	Contradiction
A	okay
B	and
A	oh so that's where they'd met
B	yeah so I introduced them
A	so they had actually right
B	and then they came to see Jeeves and Wooster so I said erm you'll recognise who it is because it's
A	right right
B	so they feel cos people in the audience feel that they know you
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A also went to see Jeeves and Wooster.	Neutral
A	they know yes but the
B	no
A	no no of course not
B	so
A	last July or
B	October no it was October
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A does not like speaker B's friend.	Neutral
A	oh okay October
B	guess the performance was so
A	oh okay
B	last October at
A	briefly
A	mm
B	briefly and
A	yeah so of course
B	he wouldn't
A	he wouldn't remember
B	so a guy comes up to him
A	no
B	in the pub going oh hi
B	who is this guy that knows all about my life you know?
A	yeah yeah
B	and knows my name
A	yeah mm
B	like this and then he's dancing round with me going
B	and I said I have to tell you later but to
A	no
B	I said
A	I don't think he's got the message at all really
B	I said no I said it would be really difficult I said I'll I organise this social event I'll be sitting around the table with my friends and then you turn up and that's gonna be so awkward
A	yeah
B	so awkward
A	yes
A	oh
B	I couldn't give you any time
A	I'm not liking this
B	I couldn't give you any time so
A	he's getting more and more needy
B	he's
B	anyway he went mad about that when we had this chat at at
B	how practical you are
B	and I said you
A	needy
B	yeah
A	as in demanding my time

A	by his wife?
B	yeah because he was
A	yeah
B	but they were away at Center Parcs that weekend so he wasn't at the open meeting and he messaged me and said I won't be there will you be there? can you get listen out and get any information for me? so I said okay so after it I messaged back and said everything that you need is in the Shakespeare in the Park website so you can download all the audition pieces from there
A	mm mm
B	to bear in mind for their audition so he didn't respond and he didn't respond and he didn't respond that was like on the Sunday after the meeting and then suddenly on Thursday four days later I got a text to say sorry for the late response erm I'll have you organise the social for the pub tonight I'm going to try and get a pass out come down and get the information then so I said yeah it's on Facebook I put it on Facebook with we're going to the
A	mm
B	well there were loads of people there and there were lots of Shakespeare people there so I thought he's not gonna need this information from me because he can speak to
A	anyone yeah
B	lots of people there so you know and there was a load of us around a table and then
A	yeah
B	odd not to and then he said oh are you going to bar? so I said yeah said oh I'll come with you so he came up to the bar with me so I said do you want a drink? so he said oh oh alright then another pint of Peroni so I said oh I've got a few to get so he said oh I'll help you carry them back so I said you'll know all the Shakespeare stuff now cos you've he said well I want to hear it from your perspective cos I trust you so I just said
A	mm
B	so I was gonna take my drink and go back to my place thinking he would go back to his
A	yeah
B	but what we took our drinks and then he just paused at this other table this on sort of imagine everyone else is sitting there
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	so he just paused here
A	there
B	and put his drink down and just carried on the conversation so we just carried on talking and then
A	yeah
B	came and chatted and it was just actually really nice we just talked about loads of different stuff introduced him to
B	it was really nice and then erm I just thought this is normal this is lovely this is just
A	yeah yeah
B	good
A	how it should be
B	yeah anyway but then it was only a a few people who went oh we're going now and they sort of went and I said oh gosh look at the time we should go and I said and also you've been given a pass out you don't want to abuse that so he said no no you're right I need the loo though don't go without me so he went off to the loo and
B	so that just left me waiting for
A	oh okay
B	so I said yeah I said that could be awkward though cos if I direct it you are gonna struggle to be in it and you always do it I'm very sorry about that he said a year is a long way away a year is a long way away we don't know what's gonna be happening in a year okay yeah he said don't you worry about it don't want you to be worrying about it okay good luck with the audition anyway I give him a hug goodbye and erm and then er he said I could have been happy with you you know
B	I said I know
A	well yeah could have been happy with you too
B	and he said I really miss you he said I miss the person that I am and he said when I was friends with you he said I felt good about the person that I was and he said and I don't now he said
A	ah
B	because I feel inadequate
B	with you he said
A	was that you then again?
B	maybe
A	yeah
B	I think erm I just think I've got a group message going on on the app
A	oh I see okay
B	so it's other people chiming into it so he he just said all of this and
A	yeah
B	he said
A	yeah
B	isn't that the nicest compliment? you made me feel like I was a worthwhile person but my point is that I'm always there to support him whenever he's having a erm a
A	yeah
B	something's upset him he he'll always get in contact with me for a kind word for a shoulder to cry on
A	yeah
A	he just doesn't
B	he's like
A	he doesn't reply
B	I can't I can't I can't go down that route I can't
A	yeah
B	it's too dangerous if
A	yeah
B	and
A	so it's a bit one-sided it
B	yeah and so I was just thinking the only reason that he misses me is because I made him feel better about himself so I was probably a little bit
A	mm
B	sarcastic I dunno if that's the right word when I said to him well we yeah yeah and that's the only reason because you'll never you'll never say to me I miss you because I miss something
A	like this about you
B	yes
A	or that about you yes
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	I miss your smile I miss your laughter I miss your conversation or whatever it's just I miss you because you made me feel
A	make me feel good
B	better
A	mm
B	and he said no no you're misinterpreting me you are you're misinterpreting me and he said you know I think about you
A	mm
B	all the time and he said
A	oh but he's still they're still together?
B	yeah but they're not he said they're existing he said we are just coexisting and then he said shall I let you into a secret? so I said okay and then he said
A	mm
B	whatsoever not he said
A	nothing
B	nothing not not even anything he goes to work yeah fine see you later you know he said we just exist he said we're a brilliant team and we're sticking together for the children
A	you'd be surprised though how many people are like that I think
B	well I've been
A	you sort of you hear
B	it's obviously coming to my attention more and more
A	clearly
B	this that this is what they are but that wouldn't be the life for me and that is not the life for him that is not what he wants and obviously he knows that I that I would love him but I thing is I think he's a brilliant person and he never gets told that he never gets told that he's clever or that he's done something good or er ever
A	mm mm
B	his kids just take all the holidays that are going and expect loads of stuff and you know oh I don't know anyway anyway but there's nothing that can be done about it and
A	do you still think that though? do you still think that you're not gonna do anything?
B	all I all I feel is now that it makes me really really sad because this time last year and it was wrong because we were talking to each other about things that we shouldn't have been talking about
A	no yeah I know I know but it's
B	and it was completely wrong but I was not happy
A	has that got better?
B	a little bit but you asked me the other day about the floor
A	I did and I didn't
B	it's not
A	and I didn't like to press that cos I thought oh has things slipped back to
B	well
A	unless you do it it's not gonna happen?
B	yeah but it's because
A	mm
B	and he spent Saturday Sunday and bank holiday Monday marking
A	marking
B	and before the floor can go down we need to move furniture out of the kitchen the washing machine and tumble dryer need to be
A	mad
B	dissembled and it I can't do that
A	no
B	on my own
A	so he hasn't got
B	so
A	I'll send
B	let
A	don't be silly
B	er
A	he'll do it but I mean if that's what you're
B	how can I ask somebody else to come when I've got a perfectly good husband? so he will do it but we have to
A	but you've got to wait
B	wait we have to just wait
A	so is the floor chosen? it's
B	yeah
A	on order?
B	it's all chosen
A	they're just waiting for you to give them a date?
B	I've got a price erm they
A	how long can it take to dismantle the washing machine and the
B	well the the because of other stuff we've got various furniture which is
A	oh okay so it's a bit of a
B	our awning thing out our what do you call it? gazebo in the garden and we need to put everything underneath
A	put it out there
B	in case it rains
A	yes
B	so it's sheltered
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	and we need to know when we are clear to do that so we can book
A	can book the floor
B	the floor people to come
A	yeah that all makes sense
B	then so it's this
A	mm
B	so at the moment I I we've I've got some offcuts of carpets down that when they did the stairs there was a big offcut
A	yeah
B	so the hall is actually carpeted
A	so
B	no he's in the middle of it now
A	oh still doing it?
B	but this is the final
A	right so at the end of this
B	batch
A	he should be able
B	so when all this twenty is done
A	right
B	he'll be free more freed up
A	okay
B	so that's just an aside so in my mind in my with
A	mm
B	and we'll look back in a year's time and you and
A	and see where all this fitted into
A	yeah
B	or you will have
A	mm
B	that part of your life is
A	mm mm mm yeah
B	and he was like I can't believe that I can't think that like that I think that we've had the end to our story and and that's it
A	oh did he?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	erm but then but then he said he'll say but I know that we can be happy together and I miss you and all of this so anyway I went home
A	no wonder you didn't sleep that night
B	I didn't
A	all that going round your head
B	well no that was just no that was this
A	no wonder
B	no this yeah this was seven weeks ago
A	oh okay
B	something else since then so but it made me happy because er all I wanted to know was that cos I honestly felt that he hated me and that he felt that I'd ruined his life and that he felt that that like oh my god what on earth was I doing? she was nobody why was I even bothered about her? but actually cos it's so important to me and so against what I would normally do that I wanted to feel that
A	that it had some
B	at least it had mattered to him
A	yes yeah and now you do realise that
B	yeah
A	yes so that's good
B	so I actually felt better because of that
A	mm
B	and I was in a better place of understanding
A	oh yes yes
B	but and obviously he said
A	yeah yeah
B	you're perfectly qualified for it but I can't give it to you I said I
A	don't want it
B	I know but he said I'm in the pub it's
A	yeah
B	then the next I've just
B	when he's had beer
A	oh
B	he gets all and I just thought oh god anyway it didn't come it didn't come I think he'd had enough and went home and went to sleep
A	oh thank goodness
B	they never came
A	cos otherwise it could be yeah
B	nothing came but this week last week last the Thursday was his fiftieth birthday and I'd wanted to just meet him for a drink or a cup of tea or something
A	mm
B	got a present for him and erm yeah from us and I wanted to give it to him and he was he was really I can't see you I can't do that no no no no no and really really pushed me away so from I could be really happy with you it was like suddenly I don't want anything to do with you and it really hurt me
A	mm
B	it really hurt me and I wished him a happy birthday and he
A	yeah
B	with these people in the New Forest Forest of Dean or somewhere and I knew he'd gone there and posted pictures on Facebook and on like a family walk and stuff like this and it hurt
A	mm
B	it really hurt so last week I felt really low and on Tuesday had a committee meeting and they had a Shakespeare in the Park read-through and then
A	oh god
B	and it was fine and we're just all
A	yeah yeah
B	chatting absolutely fine but
A	look everybody's going home yeah
B	what time have you got to go?
A	well er I'm alright for another five or ten
B	oh well
A	five minutes really yeah but I'm just wondering why they didn't come and clear the tray away
B	so really
B	so I didn't really want I just felt low I didn't feel like chatting at all
A	mm
B	and I'd got I got this bag and I was just like I was standing there like this
A	yeah
B	not looking at him just holding my bag like this and er and he just said
A	oh okay
B	and I said I know and he said I didn't know you were coming until you came and I said
A	mm
B	and coming back to this pub
A	it's bringing it all back
B	it's you and he said I know I know that I know that you he said I know that you hate me I said I don't hate you how could you ever say that I'd hate you I don't hate you and I said I'm just feel really sad this week I said it was your birthday and I said he said I know I stomped on all your dreams I said yeah you big stomper and he said
B	I feel really guilty but he said I'm really sorry and he said I'm just a constant source of disappointment to you I said you're not and I said I understand the situation fully understand the situation I said but memories are memories and I said I haven't purposefully thought of this but I said you know you do think when it was your forty-ninth birthday we went for a drink at the
A	mm
B	so it's difficult I said I can't help feeling low I said I completely understand the decisions that we've made and I'm completely in favour of them but I said I am an emotional person and I can't help feeling a little bit low
A	yeah
B	and he said oh
B	and then he let go and he said you've not hugged me back so I said I'm sorry so I
B	it would absolutely be you and nothing about that changes but he said it's really unfair of me to keep in touch with you or contacting you or you know
A	well and he's got a point there because it just makes it harder and harder doesn't it?
B	yeah
A	if you don't but I dunno mm
B	and he said I wanted to share my birthday with you but he said how can I wrap all of that up in a nicety? I really want to share my birthday with you however I'm not going to
A	going to
B	he said that's really hurtful to you and he said and I know you're hurt already and he said I meant what I said the other night he said I really really miss you and he said I'm gonna see lots of you now because I'm rehearsing Shakespeare
A	mm
B	and you're rehearsing Cheshire Cats and the two groups will meet for a drink on a Thursday
A	yeah
B	and he said so we'll see each other and we'll be fine
A	see if you can just be
B	we'll be fine and erm so
A	do you think that's gonna be too hard for you though?
B	no it'll be okay so I said let's go so I said you need to go so we had another hug and he said to be honest he said it's just really nice to hug somebody he said it's just really
A	gosh there's a lot of men in your life that don't get any love and affection
B	yeah
A	isn't there?
B	it's surprising it's really nice just to hug somebody and erm and then he gave me a kiss not a snog gave me a kiss
B	goodbye and I went home and I was just that just couldn't sleep then
A	oh I bet
B	I couldn't sleep and I just I sent him a big long message which I knew he wouldn't look at for days and days and days but then last night he looked at it like the night a couple of nights ago but really late like at half past midnight didn't respond
A	mm
B	and then last night he messaged me and said I hope your
A	mm
B	and he was like I'm feeling sorry he said I'm an empty vessel
B	I've
A	oh you don't wanna
B	am lonely
A	take it too seriously when they're drunk
B	I want
A	but you know
B	I want to be loved
A	yeah
B	and you've got this love to give and I can't have it and all of this and I'm really sorry and da-di-da-di-da-di-da-di-da-da-da and he just poured it all out so
A	do you think
B	no
A	just there to snap you up if you were to ever I am gonna have to go in a minute
B	you must
A	do you think he?
A	no I know
B	I'm so sorry
A	but do you think he doesn't appreciate it you don't think?
A	well yes but has he not really upped his game?
B	well we did some stuff to the house didn't we?
A	yes
B	but there's other stuff
A	yes yeah
A	oh and me
B	and he said I've got my basics I've got my house I've got my shelter I've got the
A	yeah
B	yeah he said level two emotion
A	emotion yeah
B	he said I have zero he said the the only place I've got that is with you and he said and that's that's you know it it's it's not where we should get it from is it?
A	no
B	that's the thing he said I've got
A	a massive layer of Maslow
B	inside I've got a nice car I've got a great house people will say to me god got
A	you've got everything
A	yes
B	and I said to him I've had this conversation with my friend
A	yes
B	feeling like I've got everything why do I feel lonely? because you want
A	missing yeah
B	that I got from you but you know it's erm I dunno
A	well I was talking about
B	oh right
A	yeah
B	so erm I can't remember what I was gonna say about
A	you were trying to do wills and stuff but he wasn't doing the
B	oh no fundamental things
A	tal
B	and Maslow's theory
A	yeah yeah
B	to to feel safe to feel secure to feel that you can achieve all these other things you need to have the foundations
A	foundations
B	and I feel if you're in a lifelong commitment with somebody and you've got children things like wills and a a proper non-damp roof over your head are important
A	are important have you
B	and if
A	not got wills you two?
B	well we've well we've got them but they're wrong and I want to they need to be
A	oh
B	put right because if anything happens to us
A	yes
B	things aren't gonna go in the right place
A	oh my yeah you do need to get onto that
B	and that to me
A	is is important
B	is our children's future
A	it is to me yes
B	my future if anything happens to
A	that is important
B	and that's the stuff he doesn't help me with he's a really good man and I love him completely to pieces and he's absolute just
A	but
B	but that that to me it says to me you don't really love me if you're not prepared to do that
A	to do that
B	if you asked him that he'd be devastated absolutely devastated
A	well yeah
B	because he's just laid back
A	I know
B	he's just laid back
A	but that's just annoying isn't it? I'd best stop this
B	okay
