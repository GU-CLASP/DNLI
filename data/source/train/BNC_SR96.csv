B	erm so yeah she's doing that really exciting but I still want to know about this stuff in what are you doing in Peru? were you with a family? where did you meet
A	he's German I met him in Germany
B	mm
A	cos when I was out there working as a language teacher
B	mm
A	yeah so I was out there working as a language assistant and I got a kind of weekend job as well cos I wanted a bit of extra money I was being paid quite well to be a language assistant but I just wanted more money erm and I got a job as a waitress in this hotel restaurant in town and his parents owned the restaurant and he was a chef there and so one day one day cos I hadn't thought of him in this way until then he was just like my manager
B	he was your manager
A	he kind of runs it with his parents like his parents
B	does he own it?
A	yeah erm and so yeah so anyway one day he took me by surprise and he asked me out and I was like erm oh okay so anyway we went on a couple of dates and that was really fun erm now we decided to stay together even after I'd left Germany and erm so yeah we're still together now and we've been together since beginning of May last year and he came out to visit me in Peru
B	mm
A	and we climbed the Machu Picchu together
B	oh yeah
A	to see the pictures?
B	yeah I did yeah so nice
A	and that was really cool and he was with me for ten days in Peru and erm then I just went to visit him we talk on Skype every day and like Whatsapp and stuff it's quite easy now with like Whatsapp and that
B	yeah
A	we can just talk for free
B	are you like planning to move or live together or to be in the same country?
A	the problem is he wants to stay in this town called
B	sounds pretty logical but it's not
A	yeah it's lovely to visit you know lovely for a local but not somewhere I'd want to go and live like I I couldn't go out there there's no opportunities for me unless I want to be a waitress or something to work in
B	wow
A	he's just bought the brewery from his dad and he's expanding it and he's got his own side business on their hotel and he's bought this building and he's going to extend it by three times the size and put all his big machines in there and brew all the beer and sell it like across the country at the moment they just sell it at the hotel
B	yeah
A	but he wants to market it across the country so he's got his own little business he's setting up
B	he wants you to work in it?
A	well no he hasn't said that but he's got no like plans to cos ideally I'd like him to come to London and live with me
B	so why can't he just own the business and get someone else to do all the grafting?
A	I don't know that hasn't crossed his mind I don't know whether he wants to be
B	and then he can be franchise involved or
A	yeah I mean that would be an idea
B	have one in London as well
A	problem is he still lives with like he doesn't live with his parents but he kind of does it's a weird set up like he's lived in
B	and you were like the
A	restaurant all his life
B	interesting like quasi exciting woman that walked into his
A	did go away for a few years to train in France as a chef and then he came back and worked in the restaurant actually his last girlfriend was Hungarian she still works in the restaurant
B	she still works in the restaurant oh my god
A	she's really nice actually
B	is that weird?
A	mm well I kind of dished with her before I even started seeing
B	mm
A	but erm yeah so she's she's really nice but they their friendship group they're still friends cos they are still in the same friendship group so they still see each other all the time
B	how long was it like a long one or was it?
A	two years
B	three years two years?
A	mm
B	that's not too bad
A	they met they met at a party he said she lived in Hungary and he lived in Germany and they did to and fro a few times and she eventually came to visit and came to live with him and got a job in his restaurant and she's been working there ever since so and then he broke up with her so she had to find a
B	not a life that's not what you want really and you're capable of just a lot more than waitressing been there and done there as well and it's not something I would want to go back to that would make it a bit weird
A	so yeah I'm not really sure what we're going to do at the moment we just keep visiting each other and talking on Skype and
B	let things happen that's the best thing to do actually let things happen organically
A	yeah well we're going on we're going on holiday to Paris with his friends
B	oh ah I've been thinking about Paris so much lately
A	yeah?
B	yeah to the extent where when I was visiting mum we sat in bed one day we were looking up all of these different Parisian houses and
A	oh yeah
B	French ch√¢teaus
A	want to live in Paris?
B	yeah I will do one day I think next year
A	next year?
B	oh my god
A	I guess you can speak French can't you?
B	that's the reason I want to go other than loving it and also feeling like maybe I need a bit of a new
A	start
A	yeah definitely
B	and also I'd want to go and work for them and my uncle has given me the offer of a lifetime
A	what is it?
B	I cried when he said this you know my uncle that's not an uncle but totally
A	oh uncle
B	yeah he took me under his wing
A	yeah
B	he said he sat me down one day cos he came to visit for like an hour or two in London so we met him in London and he sat me down and he said I haven't contributed towards your education he's like put his kids through like private school and everything and he feels like I'm a child I think
A	yeah
B	and so he I think he felt like he wanted to do something like that to so he said
A	that's lovely
B	haven't contributed towards your education but what I want to do is offer you the travel expenses and subsidise your accommodation for six months if you find a
A	oh that's so nice
B	so but it has to be by January 2016 cos if I haven't found it but January 2016 then it's not the offer's not there any more
A	why does if he have a blanket loan or something?
B	no it's to like make me do it so so
A	but you've got plenty of time to look haven't you?
B	no I'm just ah just seeing all of your photos and all of
A	travels
B	yeah I want to travel I haven't travelled before really got I've got itchy feet now yeah and I don't just want to I want to live for a period of time somewhere
A	I keep thinking if I get a job in Berlin that would be a good compromise cos he's only two hours south of Berlin
B	that's a really good
A	there's lot of opportunities in Berlin and also carry on improving my German and stuff
B	yeah are you actually fluent now though right?
A	yeah I'm a lot better now and I speak it every day now obviously cos I speak with
B	in German
A	in German not in English ever
B	does he not speak English?
A	he does but the only time we speak English is like when he came to visit and we were with my parents so we didn't speak any German in front of them but we do speak German together yeah
B	oh I'm so happy for you it's so bless his heart what's he like what kind of person is he?
A	he's quite like when I first met him he's got a very gentle voice and he's quite quiet and quite reserved he's not really like in your face which is why I didn't really notice him before
B	yeah
A	and erm it's only once he asked me and out and I was like oh alright so I go why not? and then it turned out I had a really good time so I was yeah
B	that's so cute so cute
A	erm yeah he's I don't know he's really nice he's really gentle he's really thoughtful he's really romantic
B	is he?
A	I was in the office one day in Peru I just got this erm someone came over to me and said oh
B	oh
A	and he'd ordered a big bunch of flowers to be delivered to my office from this really cute romantic note like I love you so much
B	oh my god
A	the most wonderful girl in the world and it's like I walked into the office and everyone was like they were absolutely humungous
B	oh my god that's so lovely though isn't it?
A	it wasn't for a reason he just did it
B	bless him
A	and for my birthday
B	nice guy
A	he stayed he left the week before my before cos obviously my birthday I was in Peru and then we said to cos his birthday was also while I was in Peru so I said we'll do birthday presents when I come and visit you in Germany and we won't bother doing it before so I wasn't expecting anything so anyway on my birthday I go downstairs cos we lived in a block of flats where there was a doorman and he let us in and out and I was walking to work one day and just as I was going out the door the doorman said oh I've got something for you and it was a birthday card with a rose in a plastic pouch and it was like a real rose and it was freeze dried so it will never die
B	oh my god
A	and it said erm erm hi
B	what?
A	so we also had a maid that used to come in and clean every day
B	no way
A	so I got home and there was a present and a card on my bed
B	on my bed?
A	which he'd given to the maid and said on her birthday can you put that on her bed
B	on your bed particularly on your bed?
A	yeah from him so I was like oh my god I've got another present
B	that must have been so weird
A	it was
B	to find something that you hadn't left
A	well I knew the maid there so it must have been something he'd given to the maid to put on my bed so I opened it and mm I opened the present and the card said erm go onto your computer and open this document it's a it's a password protected document you've got to find the password yourself I'll give you a clue it's related to the last love letter I sent you we were sending each other letters while I was in Peru
B	yeah
A	and then anyway a long story short I found the password was and it was something like I love you one two three four
B	right
A	I opened this password protected document on my computer and it said now if you go to somewhere close to where your other present was you'll find another little surprise so I was like well must be under my bed then I'm guessing and there was a present under my bed that he'd put there while I was there
B	oh my god no way
A	with a card
B	he put there?
A	yeah he actually put there
B	another card
A	three cards got so many cards this card said well done for finding this present up to now you might want a break so I recommend that you go to this particular bar and order this particular drink and I was like oh my god
B	oh my god
A	so
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	that was just down the road
B	yeah
A	well unfortunately it had been closed down the day before for two weeks by the health and safety people and so I was like oh okay I hope that was the last one and I you know I don't have to go to somewhere else so anyway we just went out somewhere else and the next day I said you know I went to the bar I don't know what was there but erm you know I couldn't pay for my drink
B	oh
A	he'd already pre paid for my drink as well he paid for my drink so he'd arranged with the people behind the bar that he would he'd paid for this drink that I was going to order and then that was the signal for them to give me my present my main birthday present anyway
B	no oh my god
A	so I sent them I wrote them a little note cos I said I thought you know the boss must be going in and out at some point like someone will be so I wrote a note saying my boyfriend came in a week ago and gave you a present to give to me I was just wondering if you could email me and I can come and collect it or something anyway someone called me up and said yeah come down so I went and collected it and it was this picture of us that he'd ordered and it was in a block of plastic so it was in the back so it
B	oh yeah
A	was like a block of plastic and our picture at the back
B	yeah
A	it's all nicely wrapped and everything
B	and what so it's stand free standing
A	so it stands up yeah so I mean it was a really romantic idea it just didn't quite work out the way he'd planned
B	oh bless him he must have been so annoyed
A	and it opened a week after that opened back again
B	oh my god so much effort went into that and it's really shit that they didn't like
A	well they didn't know
B	they didn't know how to contact him?
A	yeah they didn't know how to contact him cos he thought you know oh that's my job done
B	you would never think oh this place is going to be shut down the day before as well
A	yeah cos
B	oh bless him
A	but at least I did get the present in the end like that wasn't a complete waste
B	is it that photo?
A	it's that photo yeah it's the most romantic birthday surprise I've ever had in my life so well planned
B	oh my god it's so lovely that's so lovely you deserve it so much there were no good men in
