A	oh having trouble? oh dear what is going on
B	well they're mustard seeds
A	and you don't want them in there?
B	I want them in the bacon not the carrots going in
A	well happy Easter come on let's do a toast in the library
B	yeah he did alright for us didn't he?
C	what's that you're drinking?
A	I'm finishing the Prosecco
C	oh good
A	because
C	well I
A	it's still got a little bit of fizz in it
C	no no no no right
A	er well it had no top on it
C	no
A	no stopper
C	yeah
A	nothing
C	yeah
A	and it's still yeah
C	it it's good you know keep it in the fridge and it it keeps its bubbles
A	I mean I'm surprised
C	yeah very good actually
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	I did not know that about Prosecco
C	well that was quite funny
A	yes
C	by a a significant number er a very significant number it was so significant that I was surprised
A	yes
C	but
A	right
C	so I could see I could see it was two six eight and I could see that the addition was wrong so I said hold on a minute
C	you haven't added your score up correctly
A	yeah
C	so he corrected that and it was still about fifty ahead I'd actually finished the game by going all out
A	mm
C	with my two letters only and then we discovered there was one letter in the bag so we were
A	oh
C	both cheated
A	ah
C	and er so no but no he won quite
A	yes
C	significantly it was it was quite an interesting game it went very quickly to start with and then
A	no
C	so it was blocked in all sorts of directions
A	yes
C	and then he threw away all those Is and I picked them all up
C	so and
A	someone had to get them
C	Is are a a selection of Is are a useless combination
A	yes
C	yeah but it was a good game
A	well yes
C	forever actually
A	and you've got that erm
C	yeah
A	sort of platform that rotates around
C	yes yeah we do actually
A	as well
C	yeah yeah
A	yeah that's good
C	that's quite useful
A	yeah
C	yeah yeah
A	I don't know how
A	I couldn't
A	er so
C	mm
A	an extra thing to deal with there
C	no to read you know
A	yeah
C	you could
A	mm
C	places if I'm looking
A	mm
C	at it upside down I could probably find
A	yeah
C	somewhere to add you know to a letter to add some letters
A	yeah
C	to it but to actually erm infill
A	yes
C	upside down I I don't think I could do
A	clever
C	mm yeah
A	I can write backwards
C	ah well that's brilliant then
C	with
A	but it's a bit of a useful skill but I can
C	well er er yes
A	I don't know why I can write backwards but I can and just use my left hand and I can write really easily backwards
C	really?
A	yeah
C	cos that's
A	then you put it in a mirror and it's correct
C	yeah
A	but I no I wonder if anyone can or if it's a very special skill that I've got
C	no I don't think I've ever tried
C	I don't think I could
A	there was a job that
C	I mean if
A	required writing backwards
C	if when you write it backwards
A	yeah
C	do you write each letter normally
A	no no
C	or do you write the letter backwards as well? so
A	no the letter backwards
C	if you were writing bag
A	mm
C	the the G would be
A	yeah
C	backwards itself
A	yeah yeah
C	yeah and then the A and then the B
A	I do it joined up but
C	yeah I could do bag actually quite easily
A	yeah
C	I can see that
A	yeah well you can have a go if you want
C	yeah
A	but er
C	I think I think I
A	I don't know why I knew or discovered that I could write backwards
C	yeah
C	no and certainly not
A	I must have thought
C	not a skill not in the
A	oh I'm going to try to write backwards
C	national curriculum
A	exactly
C	yeah
A	typical me
C	yeah
A	to learn to do something
C	mm
A	completely useless
C	we've got one credit card yes
A	is that for emergencies or or just
C	no we use that we use that as the if the account is getting rather low
A	okay
C	you know and then we just you know
A	yeah it's quite useful
C	put it on to the next one actually
A	for that isn't it?
C	and we we pay it off by direct debit
A	yeah
C	so it
A	yeah
C	at the end of a month automatically
A	you don't get any interest er put on if you pay it
C	no
A	straight away do you?
C	no
A	that's the best way
C	yeah
A	to use them
C	and that that works perfectly because we
A	that does work perfectly yeah
C	we don't have to worry about it
A	yeah
C	we don't have a limit
A	no
C	the it it is paid off
A	yeah there's nothing in it
C	yeah
A	for the banks when people use it like that
C	yeah yeah
A	but I suppose they're banking on
C	but most
A	excuse the pun
C	most people don't
A	on
C	yeah
A	the people who don't use it like that
C	yeah yeah
A	and build up debts
C	because too many people use it
A	well
C	with no means of paying it
A	well exactly
C	yeah
A	that's kind of what they want isn't it?
C	yeah yeah
A	because if everyone used it sensibly like you are they
C	yeah
A	wouldn't make any money out of it
C	no no
A	so
C	but you know when you read of people
C	who spend
A	yeah
C	three thousand pounds on Christmas presents
A	that's unbelievable isn't it?
C	it's
A	but
C	yeah
A	it was it was in the nineties that it
C	well yes
A	just like that
C	yeah
A	and they made it seem a very normal
C	yeah that
B	well
C	everybody did it
A	a nice thing
C	and that you know
A	yeah
B	Sainsbury's card
C	yeah
B	so you get
A	yeah
B	specials things off ended up it was a credit card she'd signed up for
A	yeah
B	so
A	but it's
C	yeah
B	but I mean it just as simple as that
A	it really was appalling
C	yeah
A	and they wanted to just trap you into it
C	yeah
A	so they were all really nice and sort of oh yes and this is you know
C	mm
C	yeah
A	and so trap people into er
C	yeah
A	knowing they must have known full well that this is not gonna be in anybody's in people's favour
C	yes yes
A	if they're gonna make money
C	exactly yes
A	then
C	well because it's it's erm
A	absolutely yeah
C	er we live in a in a absolutely era
A	where you want things
A	and want them instantly
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	you see
A	so
C	when you were a child
A	mm
C	you know if you wanted anything
A	you had to wait
C	you collected you you had
A	you saved up
C	money boxes you put all your pennies in and you saved up for
A	yeah no that's all the
C	the whatever it was and it wasn't anything of any huge value anywhere anyway
A	well awful I mean
C	yeah
A	so such an easy trap to fall into because
C	yeah
A	the banks
C	yeah and then
A	are not being responsible were not
C	yeah
A	being responsible
C	yeah but then you see you have you know these stupid mothers who
A	well they're obviously gonna
C	yeah
A	fall into it aren't they?
C	yeah so then they get asked by the bank for the money so then they go to a loan
A	yeah
C	sharks
A	exactly
C	and and then they they just end up in
A	but it's the banks faults in the
C	yeah
A	first place
C	yeah
A	for giving the
C	yeah
C	yeah
A	it really is
C	yeah
A	the banks have
C	yeah
A	absolutely disgracefully
C	yeah
A	I
C	and they paying the
C	yeah
C	yeah yeah
C	yeah
C	yeah
A	completely
C	yeah
C	yeah
C	yeah and
C	home
A	and
C	assessment
A	unbelievable
C	no
A	really is appalling
A	but it
C	people lose their houses what's that called?
A	erm repossession
C	repossession on god
A	yeah whole
C	yeah
A	the whole thing erm
C	yeah
A	I don't know how
C	cos we have a
A	er
C	almost next door to where we used to live actually
A	right well I can picture it
C	yeah there was a a big big shop it used to be bathroom bits and bobs
A	yeah
C	you know erm and he ran a very very successful business then his daughter got married
A	uhu
C	and did she have everything? including the horses and carriages and the whatever and the whatever
A	oh that's just ridiculous isn't it?
C	actually
A	yeah
C	and he bought them their flat
A	mm
C	in in
A	oh
C	his whole business collapsed he obviously
A	that's ridiculous
C	borrowed money and then couldn't pay it back and
A	and that's something I
C	the business
A	just do not
C	yeah
A	understand
C	yeah
A	is people getting into ridiculous debt to pay for a
C	a wedding
A	wedding
C	twenty thousand pounds
A	I mean
C	is the average price of a wedding
A	no way is it really?
C	yes yeah
A	twenty thousand pounds?
A	that's just crazy it's ridiculous I mean
C	yeah
A	that's twenty thousand pounds
C	well it's yeah
A	you could put towards your life
C	yes yeah your house
A	it's like
C	your home
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	just go to the
C	or life
A	registry office
C	yeah
A	why do people think that's such a
C	well I but they do
A	what
C	they do I mean they spend
A	wow
C	you know
A	well I mean you can have a
C	and another thing
A	you can have a a
C	wedding dresses
A	celebration without it being
C	a party
A	twenty thousand pounds
C	yes exactly yeah yeah
A	that's so ridiculous why do people place so much
C	but you see if you think it starts at about
A	importance on one day
C	yeah yeah and you know what is the day? the day is just a day
A	and the day's gonna be over
C	signing a
A	and that's it
C	yeah yeah
A	it just it's a party
C	but it's it's this it's this
A	it's a weird idea
C	well you see
A	that that's important
C	yeah yeah but it starts when you think about it
A	mm
C	are obsessed with what's this film called? Frozen
A	mm
C	you know the dressing up the princess thing
A	yeah
C	and it's that image that
A	that's keeping it all
C	that they carry
A	the fairy tale princess thing
C	and the yeah the the fairy the bride's day except oh god what a load of nonsense
A	well yeah that would be
C	my wedding dress
A	Disney that's got a lot to answer to
C	cost thirty pounds and I I made it
A	yeah
C	my wedding dress did
A	well I just think
C	and I I made
A	yeah exactly
C	and and
A	yeah
C	but er
A	I don't I don't understand that
C	no yeah
A	there are some things I will never understand and that's one of them
C	yeah
A	really think what you could do with twenty thousand pounds
C	yeah yeah well I know two people one of them a great friend of
A	yeah
C	who equally well had a
A	oh yes there was the one the
C	yeah both of
A	the granddaughter who wanted to spend about
C	four thousand pounds on flowers
A	on flowers
C	but I mean that wedding knocked up the both weddings were getting on for
A	well then they get divorced in a few in a
C	they did they did
C	yeah er
A	and that's quite common I think though when
C	and
A	well
C	two three months of a wedding
A	I've I've heard of this happening where the wedding is the focus
C	yeah
A	and it keeps everything buoyant
C	yeah
A	in the relationship
C	yeah
A	because they're both
C	yeah
A	busy and
C	and
A	focussing outside of their relationship
C	yeah
A	on the wedding
C	yeah
A	and then
C	but
A	when that's all over
C	and it it's back to the same old kitchen sink
A	yeah
C	with the same old Hoover and the same old
A	yeah
C	washing machine
A	so nothing to divert
C	and yeah
A	from
C	and the the illusion
B	that was and I would always
A	their life
B	you always worry
A	yeah
B	when couples suddenly get
A	well I
C	well I actually
A	I do question it actually
C	yeah yeah
A	well yeah
A	happily busy planning it
C	and I said to them I said you know this is a recipe for disaster because
A	no you're right
C	just going to go back to the same old house with the same old fellow
A	yeah
C	who's exactly the same old fellow
A	I mean it's like having a hobby
C	yeah
A	for eighteen months
C	yeah
A	because you can focus on
B	what happened? have they split up or
C	er er two months later she went back to stay with her mother
A	mm
C	and she's gone off to Australia to her father
A	and how much did they spend in the end?
C	the well the well for one thing she didn't have one wedding dress but
C	actually bought
C	well she bought a dress it had to be altered it didn't fit when it was altered and
A	yeah
C	but this dress wasn't big enough and
A	oh dear
C	and so she didn't want it so they had to pay a whacking sum for the altered dress
A	how ridiculous
C	and then she got a different one
A	oh my god
B	stupid
C	but
A	but it was probably
C	and and then er within a year
A	the shock of reality
C	yeah yeah
A	cos the wedding's a fairy tale
C	yeah
A	and it's not real is it?
C	and it
B	well it's a distraction
A	yeah
C	it's a complete
A	it just
C	waste of time
A	yeah
C	I mean do you remember
C	yeah
A	well I think
C	they had to
A	which is fine if you know that it's just
C	yeah yeah
A	just a bit of fun and
C	mm
A	if you're a millionaire then that's not a problem
C	yeah
A	why not?
C	yeah
A	er it's just a bit of fun and you know that it's
C	yeah
A	just indulging in a
C	yeah
A	bit of a fairy
C	yeah
A	tale thing but
C	but I think when
A	if you don't have the money
C	yeah
A	that's just crazy
C	yeah I think when
A	apparently erm
C	which is another piece of paper but I
A	yeah
B	but they may not they've not been inclined to do that so far
C	no but I think they they they might not but if they do they'll just
A	but would did they just do it so that they could stay?
C	you know go tot along to whatever office and they'll probably have a party afterwards
A	no cos they're going to yes they'll want to
B	it's like when
A	yeah
B	and take
A	yeah
B	as a witness
A	maybe or you'll be the
B	just take
A	yeah
C	he'd like that actually
A	but erm can your mother in law be the witness?
B	don't see why not so long as you're a person
C	yeah
A	is it can it be anybody who's a witness?
C	yeah uh-oh
A	so you only need two plus a witness?
C	two witnesses the
A	oh is it two witnesses?
C	oh
B	two
C	I think it might be two
B	it can't be
C	thinking of my Dickens novels
C	or Hardy novels even better
A	but you have to go for an
C	mm
A	for an interview and everything
B	no
A	when you get married
B	no
A	you do
C	no only in a church
A	no I I looked into it
C	ah
A	and you
C	oh right er probably
B	that you're not
A	yeah
C	you've not been married before
A	it'll be
C	and they're not trying to get an immigrant in
A	yeah
C	yeah exactly it's that you're not
A	yeah
C	you're not marrying a
A	yeah
C	an Afghanistani lad who's forty years younger than you are sort of thing
A	yeah
C	I think it's probably just to to
A	yes it'll be that sort of thing
C	check out it's that sort of thing actually
A	yeah so but that's for
C	cos even when we got married you know we got married
A	I have looked it up
C	well done
C	well done
C	well you know
A	gosh so a bit of an achievement really
C	seriously with the two of you you've got a lot of communal investment
A	yeah
C	it it's
A	I know
C	it's actually you know that point of view as as
A	mm
C	to secure erm
A	well it's just
C	yeah
A	everybody knowing what's what that he's my next of kin and
C	yeah
A	he's my husband I feel really
C	yeah
A	stupid saying boyfriend
C	well yes and I don't like the word
A	I mean he's not
C	partner
A	no it's like a business arrangement
C	which is why I used the word daughter-in-law
A	or you're either or it makes
C	yeah
A	you sound you're either gay or it's
C	yeah
A	your business arrangement
C	yeah
A	so I don't know what to call him so I call him my husband and then
C	yeah
A	people go oh I didn't you were married
C	when did you get married? yeah
A	I think oh for god's sake
C	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	A loves calling him his boyfriend.	Contradiction
A	you know
C	yeah yeah it's
A	but I do think people place too much emphasis on it it's like oh I didn't know you'd got married and it's like oh for god's sake
C	oh yeah
C	yeah
A	just for everybody knowing what's what it does make things a bit easier
C	yeah I mean there have been cases
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	A loves when people ask them when they got married.	Contradiction
C	set up with a partner not so long ago somebody who a man who lived with his partner for twenty years
A	who and then yeah
C	but had never actually divorced his wife and in fact he he became quite successful with his second wife
C	who was not
C	the first wife got the entire estate
A	yeah
C	and that's the end of it
[ANNOTATION]	The second wife was actually the sister of the first one, which caused quite a scandal in town.	Neutral
A	yeah I know
C	no questions asked
A	mm
B	my friend at work who I used to work with my friend now er she was married years and years ago in
[ANNOTATION]	She didn't get married recently, but some time ago.	Entailment
A	oh
C	because it said
B	in
C	I leave my house to
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	in er
A	but she didn't take it though did she?
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A has never called their partner his husband because that would confuse people.	Contradiction
B	well she sold it back to the to the widow for a pound
A	ah
C	ah that was good
B	uhu
C	you I mean er what's the situation with dear uncle
B	he seems to rewrite wills quite frequently
C	does he really?
B	I get the impression he does
C	yeah
B	I thought you came across his will
C	well er but a will that was dated
B	that day you were tidying up
C	something like twenty 0 nine or even earlier than that which left the entire content quote entire contents of the flat to you
B	that's what he's said for years
C	but that's that's all
B	yeah
C	means everything that's in it
B	well it means that he legally owns
C	not that you're gonna argue about that and demand the entire contents of the flat but that is the stupidity of it
A	want some more wine? oh you've got beer
B	just another beer darling
C	I just he'd leave somebody now to to to I I take the view I mean when we gave you that money for your for the whatnotties that it's far more sensible for you to have it now and we receive grateful thanks and you get the use of it than after we're six foot under the soil
A	yeah well I mean that's
B	yeah
A	but er but very grateful as well but both you and
C	yeah
A	my
C	your mum
A	you and my mum allowed some money to be released
C	yeah yeah
A	cos it makes sense because
C	it does yeah
A	look at how much money has been made because
C	mm
A	we were able to
C	well yes
A	buy a property
C	yeah yeah
A	it's just well why
C	I mean just think
A	it's ridiculous it's it's er
C	yeah
A	a no-brainer really
C	yeah exactly
A	mm
C	yeah
A	but er yeah
C	I mean you should have done it years before but that was good time actually because we had downsized
A	should have done it years before and obviously the time was right but why I didn't think of doing it years before I don't know
C	yeah
A	really weird
C	yeah
A	that I didn't think of it could have done it years before
C	mm
A	but I think my dad might have had something to do with it somehow everything got a bit more I think easier
C	when it was just your mum cos your mum wasn't yeah
A	yeah I don't know
C	yeah
A	exactly why but
C	yeah yeah
A	I think maybe he was
C	well
A	sort of holding things very tightly
C	yeah but but
A	or something maybe not
C	but but
A	but I'd put it to them in a way that sounded
C	yeah
A	really sensible which it would have been
C	yeah
A	then erm
C	but of course
A	yeah
C	by the blink of an eye now
A	yeah
C	renting is becoming absolutely I mean god knows
A	oh it's ridiculous
C	what
A	no it would be far more expensive
C	what the rent would have been on number two
A	than what we're paying yeah
C	yeah
A	absolutely
C	and and house prices they say in London er in the month of February house prices in London went up on average er of course you've got twenty million pound houses rather distorts it but
A	mm
C	the average was fifty pounds a day
A	yeah
C	that's three thousand a month
A	it's crazy
C	yeah but you know if you look er I look at Rightmove and I put in two hundred and fifty thousand and
A	you get a flat now
A	yes
C	yes
A	god
C	yeah
A	the skin of our teeth wasn't it?
B	well ten years ago though if we'd bought our
A	well that's what I'm thinking
C	yeah
A	because ten years ago and we'd be millionaires by now
B	mm
A	and I blame myself
C	mm
A	so I could have thought of it and I could have legitimately asked my parents and then would have started the ball rolling
B	well when was the money that you gave me? that's when you sold
C	well that's when we downsized
B	well when was that? what year?
C	er 0 seven
B	so 0 seven which was almost
C	nine years ago
A	that was before you'd
C	yeah
A	mm
B	so that was only three years
C	that's when we downsized
A	no it was when
C	yeah
A	and I I think even before then
C	and what would he have sold it for?
A	well now I mean at the time it seemed ridiculously out it seemed out of the question at the time
C	how much was it?
A	but I can't remember but I mean I know
C	oh right yeah
A	now
C	no
A	it would seem
C	it was very
A	ridiculously low
C	mm mm
A	well maybe it still wasn't well I didn't think how I couldn't think or my
C	well cos I mean you
A	my
C	yeah
A	way
C	yeah
A	possible
C	and in a way
A	at all
C	I mean neither of you could have afforded that and
A	but we could have if we'd
C	we were not in a position then
A	oh you were
C	when
A	oh
C	when
A	mm
C	in a position to
A	so it would have just been
A	me getting some money from the will
C	yeah
A	well maybe it wasn't possible
C	yeah
A	it probably was though because if say I'd got thirty thousand pounds
A	it might have been enough for a deposit
C	yeah yeah
A	in those days
C	yeah mind you
A	yeah it would probably seem really small
C	yeah because
C	if you think in that
A	mm
C	you had a double bed
A	yeah
C	and there wasn't much room
A	mm no not with a double bed in there
C	round the edges of it no and I mean look if you put a double bed in here
A	mm
C	or indeed even down in the snug how much
A	it would be interesting
C	room there'd be
A	to go back in there and
C	yeah
A	see what the size would be like
C	and and remember how narrow the hall was?
A	yeah
C	yeah but I'm sure
A	but a lot of it was the that they had it was very Heath Robinson wasn't it? the way it
C	well it that downstairs shower was
A	it had been
A	tagged on here and
C	yeah
A	you know a washing machine
C	I
A	under the stairs
C	mind you I think that was a very clever place to put it but
A	but
C	it should have boxed in
A	obviously appropriate for a shared house in the circumstances but
C	well no I think a a very good place for a washing machine
A	yeah
C	but it should have been in a cupboard
A	well yeah
C	under the stair
A	but it was just a rented shared
C	yeah
A	house
C	yeah
A	so and the
C	yeah it wasn't home
A	yeah it well and the whole shared thing made it quite hard for it to be
C	yeah
A	home
C	yeah yeah
A	we did well
C	you know sharing a kitchen
A	you know and it's just
C	sharing bathrooms and things
A	it's impossible to get control of things
C	yeah
A	domestically when
C	yeah yeah
A	you're living with
C	and that partly
A	other people
C	that's partly why you're so darn good at
A	well you can get control of it
C	still enjoy it
A	but you can't
C	yeah

A	ah
C	a
B	the customer was understandably somewhat startled when the box of DVDs was opened and Cupcake jumped out
C	did he jump out after eight days?
A	mm I suppose he would do
C	well you you'd think he would me I mean he hadn't had any food or liquid or anything
A	no amazing

A	they do
B	silently
A	that's what they do
C	I may say master
B	mm
A	ah
B	he was sulking still
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	what were you showing me in here
C	we had a look at the pouf well we didn't have a look at the pouf we had a look at the picture of the pouf
A	yeah
B	I wanted to show you I like that red thing that orange lamp
A	the round thing or the small
B	the orange round one
A	oh yeah
B	cos I mirrors
A	is it a lamp?
B	yeah
A	mm yeah I like that too it mirrors that doesn't it?
C	oh
A	I'm getting a bit cold we could do with erm
B	well pop a couple of logs on darling
A	yes
C	yeah listen
B	yeah?
C	after a day spent listening to the tergiversations of his ministers the
A	what? break that down
C	ter giv er sations
A	is that as it's spelt?
B	tergiversations?
C	yeah
A	T E R
C	T E R G I V E R S A T I O N S tergiversations
A	nope
B	no
C	tergiversations
B	mm
C	we must look it up
A	yeah
C	a word that dad and I love using and you can use it quite loudly cos nobody would know about it when it's applied callipygous
A	callipygous
C	yeah
A	nice bottomed
C	yes you know that word?
B	well
C	yes it's a wonderful word actually
C	so I mean but you know the general population does not know it so that you can
A	except
C	yes
C	your father must have taught you that word did he?
A	don't know
B	erm
A	where do you get your words form
B	when I first came across word it was
A	what's the best way of learnings words do you think?
B	well we came across that word on a cryptic crossword
A	do you think
C	ah that's where dad found it as well actually
B	I can't remember the clue but it mentioned Kylie Minogue
A	do you think crosswords are the best way
C	yeah
A	to learn to expand your vocabulary
C	er crosswords are very good actually
A	yeah I I think so
C	they they've got to be high-quality crosswords sort of thing but
B	well no I think cryptic
A	but even basic crosswords are quite good
B	cos a basic crossword you if you don't know the answer then you won't then you wouldn't well know the word so you wouldn't get it whereas a cryptic you can work out the word and then know not know what it means are you following the logic there?
A	but even a basic crossword though if you're on an app and it gives the answer if you don't know but then you can kind of make a point of remembering it
C	yeah
A	and the whole process of actually doing it as well I think
C	yeah
A	is quite good
C	yeah there were
A	of remembering
C	the
A	words
C	the one of the few clues I remember from cryptic crosswords is this one
A	yeah
C	party dress do
A	no I can't do cryptic
C	no well the answer
A	so that's that
C	party dress do is ordered the answer was Dominican
A	mm
C	dress a mini
A	oh okay
C	erm
A	could be
C	erm order can no no no wait a minute party dress do
B	you've got something wrong here darling
C	no
A	but I don't I get the gist
C	party dress do
A	I understand
C	erm yes
A	the drift
B	and then the word that gives you the clue
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A understood everything correctly from the start.	Contradiction
C	party is and the word yes can well
B	oh
C	was
B	Dominican
C	was yes
B	order
C	Dominican order
A	but I mean how do you
C	what was the third word I said there? the party dress
A	I dunno how you do
[ANNOTATION]	The speakers are playing a word game.	Entailment
C	party dress oh I've forgotten the third word now
B	oh darling
A	must have an amazing sort of brain to do
C	er yeah
A	cryptic crosswords
C	my sister is very good at them
A	but what what's the special talent that you must have
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker C's sister is older than Speaker C.	Neutral
C	erm
A	have to do cryptic crosswords?
C	actually a very good knowledge of words
A	well obviously
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	is that actually
A	yeah
C	erm and I mean really I think a warped brain
A	bit of yeah
[ANNOTATION]	To do well in crosswords, one needs to have a very wide vocabulary.	Entailment
C	yeah
A	but you're gonna be making connections where
C	yes where
A	there's really no obvious connection
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker C's sibling excels in crosswords.	Entailment
C	yes yeah exactly which is the warped brain thing
A	yes
C	you've got to be able
A	suppose that's why people like them
C	yeah you can't have a scientific brain because a scientific brain is
A	no cos it's not very scientific either
[ANNOTATION]	One needs to know more than 10.000 words to do well in crosswords.	Neutral
C	is a direct thing actually
A	which is what I can't I can't even start on the cryptic because
C	yeah
A	it's okay you can either be artistic or you can scientific in life
C	yeah
A	and it's not even scientific and it's neither
B	hang on yeah
C	dress container is ordered
B	can
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	and if is
A	did you did you get that one?
C	no no
[ANNOTATION]	B is an artist	Neutral
A	oh
C	and he
C	I you know I could see that it was a do a dress
A	so
C	and a container
[ANNOTATION]	A is a scientist	Neutral
A	the special brain for that
C	but how you write them yeah I mean and actually writing it
A	maybe writing them is easier though I would have thought if you were set the task of writing one it's probably a lot easier than actually
C	well
C	yeah
A	trying to crack it you'd just be as obscure as you want to
C	yeah yeah
A	cos
C	yeah
A	really
[ANNOTATION]	C can't write	Neutral
C	yeah yes
A	isn't it?
C	and of course there are all sorts of people that do cryptic crosswords you know
A	yeah
C	you know that
[ANNOTATION]	A dress container hasn't been ordered	Contradiction
A	yeah
C	one
A	that crop up
C	yes well yes
A	yes
C	if if the I I can't even remember any of them but if something is mentioned it it is the letter one or the number one
A	right
C	or the letter I or something
[ANNOTATION]	A finds all types of puzzles to be cryptic	Neutral
A	almost got its own
C	meaning initial
A	code
C	yes yeah
A	yeah
C	so it's yeah it yes exactly
A	mm
C	it it's got a code to a
[ANNOTATION]	A lot of different people like to do crosswords	Entailment
A	well you'd think it would have something
C	and there are some
C	and obviously the way
B	Rufus?
C	he likes Rufus actually
B	Araucaria
C	yeah what was his name
B	Araucaria
C	Araucaria
B	former vicar
C	yeah that's right
B	or reverend or something wine merchant
C	yeah now you see they're usually very good at doing them quite a lot of vicars
A	so but
C	ecclesiastics
A	before you can even
C	Latin and Greek you see
A	oh really?
C	yeah
A	before you can even start on cryptic crosswords you're gonna have to be good at basic crosswords
C	mm
A	so you must
C	well
A	be really quite advanced in your
C	yeah yeah and I think actually the fact that clerics
A	brain thinking of words
C	it's
A	right
B	father select that wine?
C	you know
A	why would Latin and Greek make you
C	er well because of the derivation of so many
B	I think your torch is on mum
C	what dear?
B	is the torch on?
A	what so you mean
C	oh dear
B	it's very bright
C	oh dear
B	it'll run down the battery
C	I thought I'd turned it off how do I turn it off then?
A	if you so you mean if you knew know the derivation of a word
C	how do I turn that thing off
B	you'll have to work it out dear go to settings probably
A	probably better if you show your mother then she'll know
B	no I like to try and enable
B	I'm a great enabler
A	you're enabling are you? by not showing her
B	what did you
A	enable me to have another glass of wine if you want
B	what colour wine?
A	there's no white left so it'll have to be one of the colours
B	what did you think of that orange round thing cos darling it would like mirror this
A	yeah I like it a lot
B	oh top yourself up I'm
A	you you do the topping up please I'm looking for
B	come on dear you've got to work this out so go back to your home screen
C	yeah I went to there pressed that
B	so you go to
C	ah right go to
C	right and
B	that's correct now weirdly that means it's that doesn't mean it's on that means select to turn it on
C	oh right well
B	it's a little bit counterintuitive cos when that says off it means it is actually off not
C	oh right
B	turn it off
C	ah right it doesn't
B	okay?
C	yeah right yeah so you press it to put it on
B	yeah
C	yeah that yeah that's like my erm Kindle
B	yeah
C	the the wi-fi on and wi-fi off
B	what's the one that you always
C	is is very puzzling
B	get annoyed about
A	erm what are we talking about?
B	oh no
A	oh god that was a classic
B	or something
A	no it
C	oh er right rather than the thing inside?
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	no I'd need to actually know the
C	yes yeah
A	actual happening and
C	yeah
A	and the actual recipe to describe
C	mm
A	what I mean but it was a classic case of someone assuming that you know what this thing is to start with
C	yeah
A	that er keep this part of it
C	yes
A	and discard that part of it
C	mm
A	but it wasn't clear so
C	yeah
A	I was doing the opposite
C	yeah
A	and I thought that you keep the bit that you're meant to
C	to discard yeah
C	yeah
A	I haven't done it before but
C	mm mm
A	erm I just think be really A B C about it you know number one take the thing
C	yes yes
A	break it down and then
C	the bit you've taken off
A	take this bit and put it there
C	the outside
C	yeah
A	but there's always this well a lot of teachers or or bad teachers sort of assume that you already know certain things
C	yeah
A	and you go sorry don't know what you're talking about
C	yeah yeah
A	but a lot of recipes well this was a recipe yeah so maybe
C	yeah
A	people should assume you know things but anyway I didn't know
C	mm
A	so I like to have it broken down into bite-size pieces
C	mm yeah I was telling
A	yeah
C	oh I know it was something to do with an auction
A	yeah
C	and it had all the details but but the key information of when it was you know so
A	yeah
C	it said where it said what it's selling
A	yeah
C	et cetera et cetera et cetera
A	yeah
C	and it gave no indication
C	as to when
A	no
B	well darling that was raised because as we were driving down there's a little mini roundabout just by
C	oh yes
B	with an arrow saying we are open
C	open
A	well what what's open?
C	well exactly yeah
A	that's a
C	it it was
A	that's a perfect example really
C	yeah exactly we are open it said it yeah
A	yeah yeah but you shouldn't er it's it's like any with technology these days people assume that you already know
C	mm
A	but like with with a mobile phone or something
C	well
A	it if you
A	this is wonderful piece of
A	they sort of know
C	yeah
A	it's like well people go well just text
C	yeah
C	well in fact when when we bought this I I went up to the desk er and a lovely
A	mm
C	was there lovely beaming smile and she said obviously because you've put down a number she sort of read out very specifically what you were buying
A	yeah
C	you know and she said and
C	such such that you see
A	a what?
C	is is that alright? I said
A	I dunno
C	I
[ANNOTATION]	she was amicable	Entailment
A	probably
C	you know I I'm sure it will be
B	I'd wandered off
C	but I have no idea what it all means
A	what you're talking about
C	so she laughed that works actually
B	well we'll have to see it on
[ANNOTATION]	she was laughing	Entailment
C	yeah er
B	and it's a nice shirt mind
C	it's a beautiful shirt that's what's so annoying actually that you know it's an eighteen er whatnotty but yeah so if
B	oh that's my job?
C	yeah
A	but we've never been to that
B	I mentioned that today it's got some huge stuff in there
[ANNOTATION]	the job is important	Neutral
A	but that's perfect for
B	be good
A	they've probably got shirts and everything in there
B	uhu
C	mm it might be open tomorrow
A	it might well be
B	hopefully
A	yeah I think it's Asian

B	I always thought it would be funny if I wandered in there to go shopping
C	yeah
C	ah
A	skinny
C	I went I went out in in
A	callipygous
[ANNOTATION]	the clothes are suitable for fat people	Contradiction
C	a forty-four double D bra
C	you see a forty-four double D bra
A	oh my god
C	so
A	how big is that?
C	bosom
A	yeah
C	well I went into the into Marks and Spencer's
[ANNOTATION]	the bra is expensive	Neutral
A	well endowed
C	you see so I'm I'm looking in the bra section she wanted a black one I remember that so I'm I'm looking there you know and I'm trying to find where these black bras are and an M and S assistant came up and said me can I help you? and I
A	she looked at you
C	she looked at me and
C	you know
A	erm
A	you might be a little bit deluded there dear
C	thirty-four A?
C	yes quite er yes erm but er
A	did she politely say
C	yes and of course
A	mm perhaps you might be a
A	thirty-two?
C	but you know her she she couldn't stop herself reacting to mm
A	and that's the other thing I can't really get my head around bra sizes really
C	yeah
A	they're a bit random
C	yeah
A	mm
B	but boobs go up and down don't they anyway?
A	yeah
C	well they say that ninety percent of women wear
A	yeah but there it just depends on the model
C	the wrong size
A	on the model of bra you've got really
B	has he had his supper
A	no
C	what are you thinking
A	he's thinking that needs a bit of rubbing he'll need to put his scent on it have you forgiven us now for the
B	quiet isn't he?
A	mm
C	he's an amazingly quiet cat
A	yes
C	when you think of
B	yeah
C	was it
B	mummy cat
A	ah we couldn't wish for a better cat
C	no you couldn't actually
A	he's not an annoying cat
C	but he's a beautiful cat as well as well actually
A	and sweet natured
C	he's neutered isn't he?
A	he's quiet yeah
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	we neutered him
C	yeah
A	yeah we got it free because he was a rescue cat
B	he had his little balls when he joined us
C	oh right
A	so therefore it's free to get them neutered if you rescue a cat
C	yeah
A	and things like that and so we sort of kind of half-heartedly
A	put a few notices up
B	we didn't put any notices up but we went round
C	yeah
B	we went round to see if there were any lost
C	lost cats
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	we didn't put any found ones
C	right
A	well er we
[ANNOTATION]	They went round to check for the lost.	Entailment
B	but
C	well that's fair enough actually
B	we were worried that he might have been microchipped in which case he would have then been returned
A	well he hadn't
B	would have been sad
A	and the collar was too small for him well I mean it's possible that
C	and he was thin
A	there was a loving and he was thin but well we don't know where he came from or what happened
[ANNOTATION]	The dog might have been microchipped.	Neutral
C	yeah
A	but if he'd been microchipped in the first place he could have been returned to the owner and he wasn't microchipped so
C	well he's he's well I think he's very pleased that he wasn't returned to his owner
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	The dog was returned to it's owner.	Contradiction
B	he's landed on his little four paws
A	mm
B	supper supper
C	go on
A	he knows that word
C	go on

C	what's there?
C	no he doesn't
A	quiet
C	make any
A	no he doesn't destroy furniture
C	yeah no
[ANNOTATION]	He knows many more than one word.	Neutral
A	I think we've been very very lucky cos a lot of cats are
C	yeah
A	quite troublesome so
C	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	it was the most troublesome thing.	Neutral
A	really lucky with him
C	yeah
A	it's given me an impression of cats that's probably not not quite reality I think if I got another cat
C	yes
A	I'd probably go and stroke it
[ANNOTATION]	he has met quite a few cats.	Neutral
C	yes yeah
A	and like
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	er I mean the only cats I've ever dealt with are these ones we have out in Greece which are

B	well this is the one we like but I can't find
C	well
B	it
C	yeah
B	is this mine? no that's yours
C	it's just near the sofas darling
B	yeah but they're at least in the shop they didn't really have any photos of them
A	I've found poufs but not the ones that we found before
B	yeah the nice one is the Heart of House
A	yeah that one
B	I think it's a bit small
A	where is it?
B	dunno
A	I've seen it in another colour and it's really nice
B	there it is there look
A	yeah
C	is that the knitted one?
A	mm
B	there's two knitted ones
A	it would be perfect cos I'd sit on it there
B	uhu
C	what
B	well this doesn't list it's not
A	it's not listed
B	featured there
A	oh I see
B	they they were bath mats
A	cos there they should be there
B	it should be should be on this page
A	and it's not
B	the only place I can see one
C	there was one on the bottom right hand
A	well I love that colour
B	it's there knitted pod but you
C	yeah
B	don't really get to see it and that's not the
A	oh that is listed is it?
B	yeah
A	yeah that's nice
B	but then Argos do one
A	how much is that?
B	forty quid
A	mm
C	how much is it?
A	I like that colour
B	forty thirty-nine
C	is that the Argos catalogue?
A	yeah
B	uhu
C	yeah
B	look darling the
C	which colour do you like there cos they had a
A	that was a sort of taupe
A	is that taupe?
B	duck egg I think that one
A	right
C	oh
A	maybe I'm getting my colours wrong again
B	I think I'd like
C	taupe is a pinkish brown
C	duck egg
A	what I meant then
B	no I think of taupe of being greyish blue
A	yeah that's what I thought it was
C	do you?
B	family we will look this up
C	I think of it being a sort of buffish pink
A	and I pronounce is taupe is that wrong?
C	taupe I pronounce it
A	taupe
C	taupe
A	oh gosh
B	well maybe they're two different words
A	no but I can you can go through a lifetime saying things
C	well you know until
A	in the wrong way and
C	until
A	no one actually pointing it out
C	until recently I thought that the expression the hoi polloi
A	yeah
C	meant the the
A	the aristocracy
A	no what
C	tocracy and it's the very opposite
A	yeah
C	it's the chavs of the world
B	yeah
C	the hoi polloi
A	but it sounds
B	now taupe
A	it sounds like aristocracy though
C	yeah
A	doesn't it?
B	taupe
A	but you can and then you realise all those moments where you've said completely
C	yeah I might have
A	the inappropriate thing
C	yes exactly
B	taupe is a brownish grey colour
C	oh well I'm thinking brown
B	it's from the French
C	brown
B	it's French mole from Latin
A	okay we're both wrong then cos I thought it was a more bluish grey
C	well you got the grey and I got the brown
A	alright yeah
C	are they trying to evidently?
A	they are trying to say evidently
C	really?
A	and I thought that evently was a word because my mum has said that
C	for for
A	forever
C	and which sister?
A	and evently the the family
C	oh
A	up the road evently evently evently evently
A	it's not a word and I didn't know that wasn't a word until quite recently when I've sort of been studying words more closely and
C	and discovered they'd missed I D off
A	actually no it was when I actually transcribed evently and it was coming out underlined
C	yeah
A	it's not a word
C	yeah
A	so so that must have been a quirk of my mum's that
C	yeah
A	from her family
C	yeah
A	that it sounded very legitimate when I was growing up
C	yeah
A	and I thought evently was as word but no they mean evidently
C	yeah
A	and then I I pulled my sister up on it and I said oh
A	and she said no I'm meaning evidently no er no no I'm saying evidently and well no you're not you're saying evently and she does
A	she says evently
C	yeah
A	so it's quite possibly to go through a lifetime saying completely the wrong
C	the wrong thing
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	but I would have thought hoi polloi sounds
C	well I
A	something posh
C	I think it sounds posh
A	it sounds posh
C	exactly the hoi polloi
A	so it's the opposite
C	yeah I thought I was quite amazed
A	of posh
C	in that I only discovered that
A	yeah
C	I think only a year ago or so
A	oh well
B	oh well there you go
A	it's always good to learn
C	yeah I mean
C	where does the expression chavs
A	yeah that's very recent
C	council house and
A	chavs
C	yeah
A	is a really recent expression
C	yeah
B	I don't know what the erm
C	but what's the
A	I don't know where it came from
C	yeah
B	I don't know what the lexical
A	where that would spring from
C	yeah
A	no I don't know
B	could be an acronym
A	chavvy chaver chavacious?
C	oh council house
A	oh
C	wait a minute yes wait a minute
A	yeah could be acronym
C	it's something like it is it is it's an
A	house something
B	there you go
A	yeah it'll be
B	when I was growing up
A	yeah it is an acronym
C	council house
B	when I was growing up those people such people were called Kevins and Tracys
A	well I remember
C	were they?
A	casuals do you remember casuals?
B	in er Edinburgh I do
A	and that was yeah
C	what were they? what were casuals?
A	erm
B	sort of the equivalent to chavs bit better dressed I suppose
C	yeah
A	they were quite well dressed actually that was more of a
C	yeah
A	the type of music they were into
C	yeah
A	they liked Level forty-two
C	yeah it is
C	er it it is er chav is council house and violent
A	okay
C	yeah that's what it is
A	yeah it makes sense
C	yeah
A	and yuppie is young up
B	er
A	what's yuppie stand for?
A	young up and coming
C	upward yeah upward mobile

A	they're beginning to
C	yeah really?
C	yes
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Straights receive extrapoints.	Contradiction
C	yeah there was a lovely family of erm Nepalese who walked down when I was parking
A	oh they were lovely weren't they yeah
C	they were yeah er and two generations of them
A	mm
C	but you know just
B	oh
A	yeah
C	beaming
A	super friendly
B	well this is interesting chav
C	uhu oh I'm wrong am I?
[ANNOTATION]	Nepalese families have many children.	Neutral
B	er derogatory slang noun a boorish uneducated person who appears to have access to money but not necessarily to taste that's strange I wouldn't define it like that at all er probably from Romany
C	well not
B	for a child
C	well that's interesting because in
B	yeah
C	yeah where
B	that's where the boxer came from
B	yeah
C	yeah I mean there's a huge military
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	There is a large police presence.	Contradiction
C	presence
A	right
C	you know
A	yeah
C	of
B	of squaddies
C	erm squaddies you know
[ANNOTATION]	The brigade teams are enormous.	Contradiction
A	and their children
C	you know and the level of education of a squaddie is alarmingly low
A	that's alarming isn't it?
C	yeah
C	yeah
C	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	One can join the army even if he/she hasn't attended high school.	Neutral
A	shoot but
C	yeah
A	perhaps they they don't want an educated person
C	mm
A	to do that
[ANNOTATION]	Uneducated people are easier to be manipulated.	Neutral
B	they don't
C	what's the educational background of Trump?
A	of what?
C	Trump Donald Trump in America
A	is he oh I dunno
C	what it does anybody
B	I don't know dear
C	yeah that would be interesting to look up
A	I don't know what is equivalent in the UK is I can't
C	yeah
A	get my head around it
C	I
A	and I don't know enough about it anyway
C	yeah
A	cos I haven't been watching the news or anything but what where he stands erm in background and stuff what
C	well the the point is he has money
A	what would he be in the UK?
C	yeah
B	well the the
A	erm chavvy
B	exact
C	oh you mean politically speaking?
A	a type of person in the UK
C	well it yeah
A	that he'd be
C	he would be extreme right-wing wouldn't he?
A	or like who would be he'd be like?
B	well he's exactly like that er
A	and as a in a person
B	that woman that writes for the Daily Mail or the Sun that we mentioned last time
A	mm
B	Hopkins
A	Katie Hopkins?
B	yeah
C	never heard
A	yeah he
B	but of course he's fabulously wealthy
A	controversially similar
B	but then most of that wealth came from his father
C	but he
A	but he's not gonna win is he?
C	well the
B	no
C	the thing it is possible that he could
B	but it does remind one of the sixty-four election when Gary Goldwater Barry Goldwater stood for the er Republicans and he was a firebrand right-winger
C	how far did he get?
B	he got trounced by Lyndon Johnson in the election erm
C	oh right but it got up to being the nominated candidate?
B	yeah
C	yeah I mean that's the thing if Trump does get up that's what's worrying the Republicans of course that if he is up there as the the
A	it is isn't it?
C	yeah
A	but I mean I Obama was so is brilliant Barack
C	well
A	but I mean in comparison to
C	yes
A	to what's on offer
C	yeah yeah
C	yeah yeah
A	he's cool he's
C	even Bush would be an an improvement
C	er
A	saying something as well
C	yeah that is isn't it? yeah
A	but I mean my goodness that's terrible that there's
C	but this is why
A	all these people that you could potentially choose from
C	yeah yeah
A	and they're the ones that are
C	yeah but the terrible thing about American politics is you need money
A	yeah that is terrible isn't it?
C	despite and this is what Trump has in barrow loads you see
A	that's awful
C	so he's got absolutely money I mean he's a
A	yeah
C	billion billionaire
A	yeah
C	erm but anyway I just wonder what sort of educational background he has
A	and you'd think that America being America though that they'd cos they're all about the freedom of the individual and democracy and
C	yeah mm
A	you'd think that they'd have some system that
C	prevent this yeah
A	make it that it's not prerequisite
C	yeah
A	is that the right word?
C	yeah prerequisite?
A	to
C	prerequisite yeah that it yeah
A	I got the emphasis wrong
C	that it yeah that it it would
A	prerequisite
C	yeah that you
A	to erm
C	that you need money but I suppose the Americans are quite open about the fact that you need money British you you know
A	they're quite happy about it
C	British politics
A	aren't they?
C	yeah you know there are all these
A	yeah
A	they're a bit more
C	they're totally open
A	seem to be quite ashamed of themselves
C	yeah
A	in many respects
C	yeah
A	and a bit embarrassed
C	yeah
A	about money
C	yeah
A	really
C	but I mean it I mean in British politics they couldn't get a lot of them couldn't get where they do get without the backing of
A	yeah
C	various people who
A	it comes down to that
C	donate you know two hundred thousand or two million
A	mm
C	to the such and such party er you know and off it goes
A	what do you think on Jeremy Corbyn?
C	well I think
A	I think so
C	you know he's he's just sitting there
A	yeah
C	quietly the little
A	yeah
C	tortoise in the hare and tortoise race
A	he
C	he's
A	he's a wonderful erm opposition
C	yes yes
A	and we need an opposition
C	yeah yeah
A	and I think it's great
C	yeah
A	that we've got an opposition
C	yeah yeah yeah
A	at last because it was like two of the same
C	yes it was
A	really it was like
C	the exactly the same cradle and
A	what do you choose?
C	yeah exactly
A	either
C	yeah
A	they're both
A	yeah
C	whereas yeah this this
A	and now it is
C	man is quite different
A	yeah
C	yeah yeah
A	and I I don't remember it being different
C	yeah
A	for since
C	yeah
A	and this is showing my age but since the nineteen seventies when there was a difference
C	well showing my age I can't even remember what was going on in the seventies
A	well in
C	yeah who
A	in politics when there was a a difference between the left and the right
C	oh right yeah oh right who who was around in the seventies? I can't even remember that actually
A	and it was socialism as
C	yeah
A	in the old
C	yeah oh yes yes
A	old-fashioned socialism
C	yeah Kinnock and people
A	which was
C	yeah
A	really different to
C	yeah
A	right-wing politics
C	yeah all that changed with dear Blair
A	erm so and then it all broke down and became
C	really with the advent of Tony Blair
A	similarish
C	Tony Blair
A	really the same kind of outlook really
C	mm
A	which is I don't know I think that it it just Margaret Thatcher did something to change it so fundamentally that you couldn't have socialism any more maybe don't know
C	mm
A	might be just talking bollocks here
C	yeah yeah
A	cos he's like really old style
C	it's
A	opposition
C	yeah
A	where he's
C	and he's sensible he does
C	replace the
A	there's no swimming pool
C	just beyond the Arsenal well no a bit beyond the Arsenal
A	no this is
C	no no that
C	er it's not actually
A	it's a different thing
C	yeah
A	but it's all a bit political because
C	yeah
A	they
C	yeah
A	falling to pieces erm it's just insidiously clever cos they've taken the answers and they've come up with this
C	yeah
A	solution
C	yeah
A	and it's not what people said
C	yeah
A	and people said they want to create a new hub a community hub in one of the buildings which they the council are now saying they want to sell off and so what they've done is they've
C	yeah yeah
[ANNOTATION]	The community hub will have a music studio	Neutral
A	said at all and they certainly didn't say all in all but the front façade demolish the library
C	yeah yeah
A	erm which is what they're gonna do really
C	and do away do and are they going to do away with the library are they?
A	no the library
C	no
A	will still be there so it's not like saying if you say save
C	yeah
A	the right way to put it
C	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A thinks the library will be demolished	Entailment
A	it's the building that needs to be saved
C	yeah yeah yeah
A	so I've kind of contemplated a petition but then I don't know whether to
C	yeah
A	about
C	a petition specifically to the plan
A	specifically because
[ANNOTATION]	A petition might be the solution to save the library	Entailment
C	yeah
A	at the moment it's a big vague because I don't actually know exactly
C	what's gonna be behind the façade
A	because they're so
C	yeah
A	kind of smoke and daggers really
C	yeah yeah
A	and there is a plan but then that's meant to be modified because the building got listed the building was listed only kind of six days before this plan was voted through
C	yeah what listing does it have?
A	erm
C	Grade two? or
A	I think it's Grade two
C	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	The building has been listed for over a year now	Contradiction
A	and so now they're saying that the plans will be changed
C	yeah because of the listing
A	to take into
C	yeah
A	not bothering with Grade two listings and just demolishing buildings anyway so there's that
C	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	The building's plans are not final	Entailment
A	to consider and I don't know I if I start a petition now
C	yeah yeah
A	it's really hard to sort of be specific and say it's all very well to say say no to this but I wanna say say no to what exactly?
C	yeah
A	cos
C	yeah yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A is contemplating on starting a petition	Entailment
A	erm
C	would you do that online?
A	and it would be an online petition and it wouldn't make any difference but the point is cos they'll go ahead and do it anyway
C	yeah
A	but the point is to have a
C	who's your MP?
A	I can't I don't know the name but I've got email addresses
C	yeah is he is he a Conservative here or what?
C	yeah they probably are actually yeah
A	erm
C	yeah
A	not sure
C	the next thing you must do is something about the dustbins
A	that's gonna be really hard I don't think there's anything that can be done about that
C	no
A	erm cos people's mind-sets are still are now thinking there's a bin outside and
C	dump it in yeah
A	yeah and half the people probably don't understand the way things used to be where
C	yeah
A	you kept your rubbish in your house until bin day and then
C	yeah
A	put it out
C	yeah
A	so erm I mean on
C	yeah
A	well
C	you didn't no
A	you just kept it you were responsible until bin day and then
C	yeah
A	you put it out so wherever you keep it is up to you but
C	yeah
A	and especially if you've got a garden
C	yeah exactly and actually I
A	you know
C	days gone by you used to wash them anyway
A	well exactly yeah
C	you
A	but you know
C	you know terry nappies
A	it's like what? uh?
C	yeah
A	so
C	yeah
A	other waste goes in the black bin in the garden until bin day and then it all goes out the front
C	mm
A	mm but that would be a change of mind-set now so I don't think that's
C	yeah
A	even possible
C	yeah and you you're er the rubbish gets collected once a week doesn't it?
A	yeah
C	we I mean you've got an amazingly efficient rubbish collection system here
A	yeah that's
C	yeah
A	that's okay
C	because down in
A	oh do you?
C	yeah and we have a
A	okay
C	little a little bin for food waste
A	do you use the food waste one thing?
C	yeah because well we did set up a compost thing but then
A	you couldn't do it
C	flustered about it they said it attracts the rats
A	okay so not worth the hassle
C	and so well we weren't
A	yeah
C	we weren't going to upset
A	yeah
C	so we we gave
A	yeah
C	but erm but the
A	yeah yeah
C	you know the council does that
A	absolutely
C	and then one week they collect erm landfill stuff
A	mm
C	and the next week they collect the plastics and the bottles and the cardboard the recyclable stuff so it's it's quite
A	oh that's quite complicated
C	quite yeah yeah
A	gotta have a calendar of exactly
C	yeah you do yeah
A	gosh that's it's a lot simpler here
C	you yeah once you get used to it
A	you just put them out
C	it works because you know you've sent all the recyclable this way
A	but actually in your area that would
C	yeah
A	work fine because
C	yeah
A	cos people are intelligent enough to
C	well yeah yeah
A	get a calendar and
C	and remember
C	mark it down and
C	yeah yeah yeah
A	yeah whereas here you get people who don't know how to handle rubbish at all
C	yeah you see that means we only get bottles for instance collected once a fortnight and in a fortnight we collect
A	quite a few bottles
C	yeah we occasionally pass them up to
C	the collection's due so
A	sneaky
C	so they're not outside ours
C	or
A	it's embarrassing
A	yeah
C	most people go to the dump with an awful lot of stuff
A	mm
C	but again it goes back to what we were talking about last night the
A	well again
C	they they don't think
A	that's another one it's like
C	you know they put it in a bucket and it goes
A	yeah someone deals with it
C	end of it
A	yeah
C	yeah well god knows we're all responsible for our
C	yeah
A	but that's also the supermarket's fault and the culture of wrapping everything up
C	yeah well they've done well with the plastic bag
A	and the packaging culture yeah
C	business actually
A	at least that's one thing that I can say
C	yeah
A	that this government that's done that's good
C	yeah
A	only one thing that I can think of
C	yeah
A	that was of benefit
A	to the earth
C	yeah
A	or life in general is that
C	plastic bags
A	really and
C	yeah
A	it's not free
C	yeah
A	it doesn't matter if you
C	yeah yeah
A	get given them it's not free
C	mind you we we miss those plastic bags because
A	that's what I use them for
C	we use them to collect ash
A	yeah
C	and now we've we've actually had to buy plastic bags
A	well no I've had to actually I've got to buy plastic bags
C	yeah in
A	for that
C	yes
A	yeah
C	yeah but
A	rather negates the whole point in a way
C	yeah but certainly all our plastic bags that we got from any supermarket were put to use
A	no but the point is
C	yeah
A	it's made people think about it
C	yeah
A	and it's just a bit it's only five P on your shop as well and people are kind of I find that's a bit weird that oh five P oh I'm going to bring a bag
C	yes
A	so it obviously that five P has worked really well
C	yeah because it's quite
A	so it's good cos it's made people
C	you know for one plastic bag it's quite a lot of money
A	think about it but it's just the point of
C	yeah yeah
A	that fact that you have to pay for it
C	yeah
A	that has got into people's brains
C	yeah
A	and that's good but I personally think it should be fifty P
C	yeah
A	if you're gonna do that then the cost is whatever that would really work if it was fifty P
C	yeah then there would be no no bags
A	yeah no
C	yeah yeah
A	you'd never just not forget your bag
C	yeah
A	yeah why not? if you're gonna do that
C	yeah
A	do it all the way
C	because we we occasionally have found out well actually we always keep things in the car big bags in the car but just occasionally we've passed somewhere and spontaneously gone in
A	yes exactly
C	and and
A	it's the spontaneous thing
C	had a look and then bought some things and had to
A	that catches you out yeah
C	a plastic bag and it's always been useful because we've always used it
A	mm it's always the spontaneous shops
C	yeah
A	that catch me out
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	and I think the most beneficial aspect of the five P charge is it will make people just never go out without a bag
C	yeah
A	and so that must have reduced it
C	yeah yeah
A	quite significantly
C	hugely actually
A	by at least
C	yeah
A	a quarter
C	yeah well it think
A	I'd have thought
C	much more than that actually really
A	yeah
C	because
A	probably more
C	yeah cos certainly down in our neck of the woods most people go into a shop with bags
A	yeah well er I think they probably did anyway
C	yeah yeah
A	where you live
C	well
A	less so where
C	yeah but of course up here people go
A	what here?
C	yeah
A	I don't
C	well no I don't know maybe not
A	no
C	no
