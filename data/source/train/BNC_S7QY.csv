A	have you had pepper?
B	yes thank you yeah
A	and er we need to decide about that Tuesday about getting there for I I'll already I'll already be there
B	oh right
A	I'm having lunch there and and then there's the dentist at four o'clock
B	right well that's that's fine I can I can get there easily
A	do you think these vegetables are overdone?
B	erm
A	mm?
B	no I think they're fine
A	I think they're a bit overdone
B	I think they're just right actually
A	no
B	erm
A	oh no
B	how do would you prefer to eat out somewhere?
A	well I'd I wouldn't in a way because
B	yes
A	and then I suppose it would be sensible to find somewhere locally well because you wouldn't want a Tube delay or something
B	no
A	yeah I've seen erm but erm
B	well we can just erm if it's nice weather we can just go out and find a bench somewhere and eat them
A	it'll be dark by that time at that time of year won't it?
B	second of September? no not not at seven thirty I don't think surely
A	well there's the Polish place on Exhibition Road but but I notice they've taken the carpets away and it was the food was never any good anyway
B	no I don't erm
A	mm?
B	yes I I remember that er Polish place and I didn't think the food was particularly interesting
A	there's a German place next door
B	oh is there?
A	yes the Goethe Institute or something I'm not sure if it's open in the evening anyway and it's nothing special
B	mm expensive though probably
A	er well there's that erm
B	mm
A	and it's very popular well I'll check erm
B	mm
A	er?
B	on the right what?
A	line
B	on the right line
A	you haven't been there
B	no right oh okay so I don't know where it is
A	it's just off Piccadilly Circus
B	oh right
A	or Victoria
B	oh
A	I think erm or erm
B	mm
A	hang on it's not Victoria it's Circle or Piccadilly so actually it's quite good
B	yeah that's right
A	I suppose we could eat at the Barbican but
B	no it's it's out of the way as well it's not
A	no
B	mm
A	they don't all and they also they're quite slow I think going around
B	yeah
A	I don't know erm
B	yeah it was erm I managed to catch up on on my emails and erm I did quite a few admin type tasks
A	Tuesday
B	yeah
A	your meeting day
B	it wasn't too bad for meetings it was quite quiet today but we had erm what we call erm a town hall which is erm supposed to be an hour and a half but is only and hour
A	where?
B	this
A	what from your desk?
B	I asked I I dialled in from my desk but erm you had the option of going to erm a a large room
A	I thought the whole point was to go somewhere
B	well this it's
[ANNOTATION]	You cannot do it remotely, it is mandatory to go there.	Contradiction
A	are there any are they really any ever any good?
B	yes they I mean it's just sort of information sharing and an opportunity to ask questions
A	er it wasn't this one?
B	as I said it was just a telephone
A	telephone audio?
B	mm
A	why? are they trying to save money on video cameras or something?
B	yeah erm
A	maybe the
B	yes
[ANNOTATION]	B could attend the meeting from his own desk.	Entailment
A	they have special lines so they don't sound like telephones
B	mm
A	even worse that one of those Skype things
B	mm well I think they're just ordinary BT lines
A	well that's not very good cos
[ANNOTATION]	Skype is better than these lines.	Entailment
B	well
A	they could afford better than that couldn't they?
B	they could do but
A	yeah
B	I I'm not complaining because erm
A	mm
B	the the sound is coming out of speakers even though I can see them talking on a video screen
A	yeah but supposing they had a broadcast quality phone line whatever that's called
B	yeah maybe
[ANNOTATION]	They could spend more money on ways to attend the meetings.	Entailment
A	Google Plus
B	can only have that with erm small groups
A	how many?
B	erm you could probably get about twenty people in that in that room
A	you mean they can all be seen?
B	yeah
A	but are they really on the opposite side of the table?
B	no
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A prefers face-to-face meetings because he's had a bad experience with online ones.	Neutral
A	I mean
B	no of course not but they they
A	no but I mean are they sitting in a line?
B	yes
A	then why don't they sit in a semicircle?
B	well it is a semicircle actually yes you're right
A	operated automatically or by a human?
B	I think it's just automatic but what what's strange about them is that when someone's looking at you they tend to look at you on the screen
A	yeah well
B	or
A	one of the students did something like that last week because they went to find a different classroom and then they phoned up from a room that they'd found and one of them must have been holding the phone as a camera so you could see the face of the other one it wasn't possible that the person making the call was holding
B	I don't know
A	do you think the person making the call cos I saw their face the face of the person speaking and I assumed the phone was being held by the other person because there were two of them
B	mm
A	and how did he know also how did he know that he was in the picture?
B	mm
A	in the frame?
B	I don't know cos
A	and then and then and then well cos he must have been erm the er
B	mm
A	so I could
B	well we we've done some meetings where we've used some application like Skype where where you actually
A	yeah we do that
B	people the other end can see
A	what? for
B	it
A	well we have erm split screens for erm the speaker and any Powerpoint that they're using
B	oh
A	but that means the speaker is often minute
B	you
A	it shouldn't have to be minute but they are in one in the one I used today anyway the er this morning
B	mm
A	yeah but that must be a that's the whole point that's what I suppose our system tries to avoid because that could be quite irritating because you're not in control of when you switch from the from the slide to the speaker are you? or vice versa
B	no we're not in control of it no but it's like when you
A	yeah so what if you're looking at something and you haven't finished interpreting?
B	yeah that yeah well that's it exactly
A	yeah well the answer is not to watch it they
B	that is quite difficult
A	it
B	trying to read something anyway while they're speaking
A	well I doubt whether a lot of people can't I think
B	no they don't no
A	so is it next week that your mother's coming?
B	no it's it's the week of the proms concert
A	so it's not next week it's the week after is it?
B	it must be
A	I I don't need to work it out I've got my diary right here and it and so I don't need to I can just look it up if I wanted to
B	well the concert's three weeks today
A	yes please probably midges or insects that will come
B	yes
A	well thank goodness I'll be on leave that week sort of
B	mm you you could be right
A	yeah
B	they're meant to to be
A	it's really annoying and I could take them back she said I could anyway er the the the assistant but
B	mm
A	the trouble is they're not really suitable for work are they? they're alright in the summer I suppose
B	yeah
A	but may but maybe not
B	though I think that makes them look a bit
A	maybe I should take them back then
B	I think
A	it's just a gigantic waste of time
B	you've got to take the other one back anyway aren't you? the top are you taking that back?
A	I don't know do you do you want it?
B	no no thank you
A	erm because I'm not even sure about the quality though I when I when I undid the buttons they didn't undo very easily I don't think it's been made with great care the buttons and the button holes are
B	well it's probably cheap clothing
A	yeah and that's what annoys me because if you can get it the same thing or similar from Primark for a couple of quid
B	mm
A	and then we didn't need anything else and so but then I thought oh yeah I'd use that coupon erm and I found out I could use it on clothing so I thought I'll have a look and see if there's anything on sale and so that's what I
B	mm yes so have you tried those trousers on?
A	in the shop
B	oh
A	they're not not a particularly good fit
B	no
A	they're a bit big actually oddly around the waist
B	really?
A	well they must make them bigger than they say
B	well a thirty-two aren't they around the waist and it's
A	yes
B	mm
A	yeah but then they won't be no it's more likely that they're like Marks and Spencer's they just make everything bigger than the than the size that they say they are
B	mm
A	and so I'd er you know I I didn't
B	I just put them by the door and then or keep them in the car and just remember to return them next time you go to
A	well
B	Sainsbury's
A	I think I would forget it if I put them in the car boot cos I don't open it
B	oh right
A	I don't know just general rubbish whatever
B	not not since I've got back
A	well you ought to look and then you could see that house that I've that erm that I mentioned and see what
B	yeah I'll have a look for it yes
A	I know where it is it's where it's that one where you road where you go under the railway bridge and you can't turn right
B	mm
A	but you wouldn't do anyway it's too late now because it's been sold
B	it's sold right that's
A	and I'm not and like I said I'm not even sure that I want to go to the hassle of all and all the expense of moving some somewhere further into this place I'm not even sure I like particularly like and the only that's the and these seagulls have been driving me mad this year
B	mm
A	yeah they've quietened down a bit
B	yes I think
A	well it did it did in was it
B	mm well perhaps there are
A	poison
A	what's your evidence?
B	I think well I just think I see I see them a lot
A	where?
B	here
A	when?
B	around and about I see them quite often well not not recently because I've not been walking at dusk but when it does get dark I've quite often see one walking across the the
A	are there?
B	or well they go in there
A	really?
B	yeah
A	well that reminds me I've got this
B	mm
A	and it means you you know when it's a
B	oh
A	erm
B	I don't know I can't remember you even
A	they used it they used it as a an example of of er how to write up a report of your presentation
B	right
A	so
B	oh this is your example?
A	yeah
B	oh that's good
A	er but even better
B	oh right yes
A	but I don't know where erm well presumably there's a link to it from the main site
B	mm
A	and that and that explains why I've been getting these emails from these people overseas cos I thought I I just assumed well I guessed it was to do with that write up because of the subject cos the topic
B	mm
A	but obviously
B	yeah
A	so it just makes you realise it's important
B	is that where that thing is?
B	where it's is that where it is on a blog?
A	no of course it's not I'm talking about my blog
B	right oh your
A	nobody's
B	oh right and the other one you were writing a few weeks ago
A	yes you've got to
B	mm
A	do it every week really and you've got to like link it and have Twitter and all this stuff and oh I think it would drive me mad you'd
B	yes
A	messing around and you'd probably have car accidents and things
B	mm
A	and
B	in order to keep the momentum
A	yeah
B	going and?
A	that wouldn't be very ethical would it?
B	no
A	or erm at least erm you'd have to have your antennae out and be noticing
B	mm
A	but why would they they wouldn't why would they see it in the first place?
B	erm I don't know the
A	you have to put a link
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A has some moral concerns about the product.	Contradiction
B	it yeah the they would be looking for something in particular they would be looking for something so they may do a hash search for something so
A	oh
B	you need to make sure that when you create your
A	it
B	it needs to have hashtag doesn't it or something like that?
A	I did put a hash thing I think but erm it's probably a meaningless one cos I didn't think about the consequences
B	cos I er I
A	but that's Twitter isn't it?
B	that's Twitter yes I've only used Twitter
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A included hashtags in their tweets.	Entailment
A	yeah but do you think the same applies to blogs perhaps?
B	I don't know
B	oh
A	I don't even know properly how to sign in I just have to mess around and suddenly it appears
B	oh
A	and then and then I have to crash out I just
B	so where where is the site? is it erm is it an internal?
A	it's no it's Blogger it's Google Google Blogger or whatever
B	oh right well
A	but I think they've made it like that on purpose so you can't escape so once you're in there you just stay there all day or
B	yeah
A	or have it open on your screen somewhere all the time
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A has no trouble navigating the website.	Contradiction
B	mm I don't know
A	you know cos
B	mm
A	no I
B	yes of course
A	but you can't you still
B	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Twitter does not use hashtags.	Contradiction
A	if you enlarge it a great deal then you lose you've always gotta be moving the the page around
B	yes you're gonna use more
A	from left to right
B	it's more it's more awkward yes
A	in fact and and that isn't the way that your eye would work with hard copy because you might be jumping around with your eye I mean and then they'll stops you jumping around the screen
B	mm
A	I don't think and there was this er we we watched this erm
[ANNOTATION]	The site the speakers use is called Amazon Blogger.	Contradiction
B	yes
A	yeah because you're busy texting
B	you're busy texting and it's you don't need to go into a bank anymore and you've got the ATMs and you do your shopping erm
A	yeah but when you do go into a bank you've gotta make sure that you erm adhere to the the the
B	yes why?
A	because I told you there's er something on the windowpane especially when it was windy over the weekend
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A only uses two hashtags in their tweets.	Neutral
B	oh could you still hear something blowing?
A	scraping across the glass
B	oh right
A	well maybe it's not that window maybe I can hear maybe it's that one
B	mm I'll have to have a look
A	have you noticed next door hasn't put anything out in front of the window?
B	what do you mean?
A	they must have they must have did they put a concrete on where you know where we've got a flowerbed there?
B	yeah
A	and they've got concrete
B	yes it's always been like that I
A	what it ever
B	oh no not not before they got there I don't remember what was there before they got there but they er I think it's more than likely that they redid it or they
A	what when they had the drive done you think?
B	no I think it was before then
A	one of their little schemes
B	mm
B	it's been it's been luck like that for some time why what what's the point you're trying to make?
A	that there's nothing there they're just being left
B	oh yeah cos they took all their pots or most of them
A	most you mean they left some?
B	they left they've left some things haven't they?
A	I don't know I haven't looked I haven't wanted to look
B	yes I mean next door she's not done anything has she yet?
A	no well thank
B	mm
A	it means that things are just going to slide and get worse
B	well she's not cutting the grass cos there are a couple of fellas came round last Tuesday was it last Tuesday when I was working from home? erm a couple of
A	do you mean she's not even employing anybody
B	no I think she
A	why?
B	well she's working all the time
A	yeah but why but nag but er if she can afford why can't she afford to get one of the many many local landscape?
B	well presumably because her family have offered to do it for her for free
B	not necessarily no
A	I think it's weird because it looks the whole house and just one person
B	mm
A	but that on the other hand it just shows you how small these houses are
B	no not for children no
A	no because they're not they're not large enough and that's why
B	mm
A	in fact it was a bit it's maybe that's why they've gone from the erm corner
B	mm probably
A	probably
B	they did but they they created two rooms out of the
A	did they? how do you know?
B	because I think we went she showed us didn't she?
A	no but no the bathroom are you not getting confused with
B	yeah they I know they did but I've not seen theirs
A	oh
B	but it's we've we've seen
A	but I don't
B	it's it's when she took us round the house
A	yes I but I that
B	well I've never been inside
A	cos that was quite cleverly done well I I mm I don't think I'm confusing the two houses
B	well maybe it was
A	she showed us
B	no I'm I'm I'm pretty sure it was
A	but I don't think she gave us a tour of the whole house she showed us the bathroom and the kitchen I think but
B	and and she she used used
A	for what?
B	cupboards
A	oh
B	mm don't know
A	so
B	mm
A	land build it properly like the one that I saw in
B	mm
A	and then why would you expect anybody to buy this place
B	mm if they're environmentally conscious
