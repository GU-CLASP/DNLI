A	so I just wanted to tell you guys about the fact that I have done an obstacle course race today which is the first time I've ever done one and I did it all on my own and I'm very proud and it was five kilometres and I got very muddy and very wet there were lots of things to jump through and under and over and climb up erm but mainly it was very muddy and I got a medal at the end which is the first sporting medal I have ever received in my entire life so there you are it just shows you that even at the age of thirty-nine you can still like achieve new things erm and as I was saying to you before I have a special one just for kids in September which is a mini version of it and I totally want you guys to do it what is your opinion
C	well I think it should be a small one cos it should be for kids and grown-ups cos not all grown-ups are as fit as you
A	do you know that's a totally valid point and in fact one of my friends
B	I think
A	do you want yeah
B	you should do it mum
A	the Spartan one?
B	yeah
A	yeah do you think I'll manage to succeed a little bit
B	also yeah and also you might be the only girl who has ever done it
A	oh no
A	I am not like attractive fit if that's what you mean
B	you are
A	I am obviously attractive fit as well erm but what erm what are your thoughts
B	woo hoo mud
B	mud
A	huge muddy muddy muddy deep puddles like Peppa Pig and my
A	I don't know if you noticed but my trainers are on the washing line I had to wash my trainers in the washing machine cos they were absolutely covered in mud
B	I didn't see them
A	no
C	did you have to wash the rest was the rest of your clothes?
A	I had to wash everything everything everything everything they were so disgusting
C	even your eyelashes?
A	do you know what? I had a big shower and I I was in the shower for ages and I thought thank goodness I've sorted out and then I was getting dressed and I noticed that I still had had loads of mud on my back
A	cost it's so kind of soaked in cos you do spend all of it totally submerged in mud
B	mum did you did you get mud on the thing here?
A	the vagina?
B	yeah
A	er I don't think well probably cos I was wearing very short shorts I was wearing pants as well obviously
B	did you get dirty?
A	that everything got completely muddy
C	did the shorts look like pants on you?
A	well you I haven't
B	but like the pants are they muddy?
A	they are super muddy so you have to wear old clothes that you don't mind getting trashed cos they will be destroyed so I wore my old pair of trainers and I wore an old sports bra and an old top and an old pair of shorts and they
C	will they die?
A	sorry?
B	er mum I need
C	would they like go poof?
A	they well the sports bra was white and now it is still looking a little bit muddy even though it's washed so it's it's but the trainers have come up fine but you do well what I was also
C	I I need to get some more shorts
A	you need to get some okay yes you do that's true well you need to get PE type shorts for this anyway but yes you do need to get some what I was also thinking was that when your Brownies has finished

A	right oh
B	and she must she must have lived there
A	are they tiny then?
B	no
A	why are you laughing at me like I'm a mad person? cos if they live under the sink they must be small
B	no the pipes are big they're really big
A	so they live underground?

C	don't forget the jam
A	shh so she's born in a sink is she raised by adults normal people?
B	she's raised by a witch
A	I'm really confused

A	right so they are living
B	and they
C	and Brussel sprouts and homework
A	hang on they are living amongst humans?
B	yes
A	okay
B	but they took all of the colour with them there's only
A	oh
B	there's only a few books which if the witches came back they wouldn't be able to touch any of those colours in the whole room
A	I don't get that what?
B	there's
A	how can you take colours? by magic?
B	no just that if er witches leave forever
A	where? the downstairs bit?
A	I'm sorry I'm not keeping up with it

A	what are you laughing at me for?
C	sorry it's just
B	when all the
A	yeah
B	must of
A	must have
B	must have
C	must've
B	must have some kind of connection so that whenever when they leave the colours just drained out because
A	oh

A	what? it's not funny
A	so there are not very many colours down below?
B	there's not colours there's no
