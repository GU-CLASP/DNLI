B	shall we stop for some dinner at
A	I don't know what
B	must be an area probably
A	I mean I maybe there is an inn like or there was
B	do you think they've named it after the book?
A	no I think the book is based on the area
B	have you read it?
A	no I've got it though
B	have you?
A	yeah
B	I always thought it was kinda some pirate story
A	no it's erm
B	well it sounds like that
A	yeah I'm not sure what that one's about
A	I don't think that's a very Daphne du Maurier thing to write
B	are you like some aficionado of road surfaces then?
A	no
B	nice clear road this is
A	is the Wizard of Oz a book? or is it a play?
B	I don't know
A	cos I thought it might
B	it was a film
A	yeah but I thought it might be a novel but I think it's a play
B	no I'm not sure
A	mm
B	that's
B	we're driving alongside
A	oh yeah oh we were talking about this it might be I'm not sure
A	well one or the other
B	oh yeah?
A	yeah
B	I thought you'd read them all
A	well I have
B	oh I don't remember being any confusion but I I thought it was quite er
A	yeah well the
B	maybe I just didn't look at it too detailed like you are
A	because like
B	you mean when the person who's saying right this is what happened but you're going back?
A	yeah
B	well it's so he's
A	yeah but it's just confusing cos there's like direct speech within that
B	mm
A	cos I remember in erm
B	yeah I can't remember now
B	I know I have read books where they just go off like that and you think what?
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	I don't remember
A	yeah cos I yeah cos I read like quite a lot of them a while ago and I remember like enjoying them but not kind of
B	yeah
A	cos of the way it's done cos it's kind of almost like
B	well I don't think he necessarily wrote it as a novel type thing did he?
A	no yeah
B	they were really made for a magazine and they they were a series weren't they?
A	yeah
B	so that probably has an effect on how it
A	yeah
B	erm
A	yeah
B	you just
A	yeah that's what I did
B	yeah
A	and I just kind of went through
B	yeah
A	and then now
B	well you know
A	yeah
B	to
A	so
B	I don't know whether it there is the death there is it that you want to
A	yeah
B	well yeah I don't think it really is there no
A	yeah
B	it it there's clever little things in there you know?
A	yeah
B	and some of them you think well
A	it is well done yeah
B	er
A	yeah I liked him like Sherlock Holmes like kind of the
B	he he eliminates everything that's like impossible or whatever
A	yeah
B	I quite liked when I read that sentence that stands out cos it's quite
A	yeah
B	just cleverly put together to explain it how he
A	yeah
B	and then there's other things where
A	yeah
B	you know?
A	yeah yeah it's good
B	it's a bit far fetched some of it like
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	erm
A	yeah
B	stuff like it is good the way he figures it out isn't it?
A	yeah
B	not that you could necessarily figure it out from that but
A	yeah
B	the way he explains it you're thinking
A	yeah it's like wow
B	well no but
B	but it would give you the idea of how determined you were
A	yeah
B	you can put the clues together that
A	yeah
B	and that's kind of what he does so
A	I like in this erm Sign Of the Four one they were like oh but how did they get in? the window and the the window's locked
B	well I brought the Sherlock Holmes that
A	oh did you?
B	just in case you wanted to watch them I know you've seen them before but erm
A	the new one's out the you know that one? that one that looked quite good on the trailer?
B	oh right yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah it might be interesting that mightn't it?
A	yeah
B	he's he's like in old age isn't he?
A	yeah
B	and is he a bit forgetful about
A	I'm not sure
B	yeah
A	cos his mind
[ANNOTATION]	Person A is amazed by bringing the Sherlock Holmes	Entailment
B	is that the
A	yeah I think it's in
B	yeah
A	and it's like you you have to keep only the things that he wants and like he forgets the things that he doesn't need
B	yeah
A	and it and it's like how can you forget something? that you don't want
B	yeah
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Person A doesn't know how to forget something that you don't want to remember	Entailment
B	like ahead of his time
A	but it's it's strange that like you could think him up do you know what I mean if you weren't a similar sort of person
B	yeah
A	it'd be quite hard to write that I think
B	mm
A	I don't really know
B	I don't think he was
A	no
B	friends with have you heard of Houdini?
[ANNOTATION]	Person B is going to have a sandwich	Contradiction
A	yeah
B	and he went once I think
A	maybe
B	that it exists
A	yeah yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Person A and B , both think that it exists	Entailment
[ANNOTATION]	Person A and B , both think that it exist	Entailment
A	yeah there was loads of like fakes then
A	yeah
B	or am I thinking of Lewis Carroll I can't remember if it's Arthur Conan if it was Arthur Conan Doyle
A	well Lewis Carroll was erm
B	oh was he?
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Person A  is talking about the other job that did last week	Contradiction
B	oh right
A	yeah
B	mm
A	and there are there is like some mathematical things like hidden in it
B	oh right?
A	but
B	mm
A	like I mean he wrote like
B	yeah
A	doesn't really seem to be any maths
B	although they say er to be
A	yeah
A	yeah but Einstein was scientific and he was like imagination is more
B	imagination is erm
[ANNOTATION]	Person B is not sure that the imagination is a good word to use for Einstein	Neutral
A	yeah more so and he's like if you want your
B	see all those fairy tales I used to make up for you
A	well
[ANNOTATION]	Person A like the way she looks	Entailment
A	if you made them up I mean like yeah you can write your own I really like cos I did that project on fairy tales
B	mm
A	er
B	well
A	he means stories yeah
A	referencing the Grimms there
A	yeah I know but that but back then back then it
[ANNOTATION]	Person A is going to have a sandwich	Contradiction
B	yeah
A	but what else would they be like to children? they would be
B	yeah
A	that's what they would've been telling them
B	well he was probably
A	yeah
B	his work was kind of like early twentieth century wasn't it?
A	yeah
B	that it became
A	it might not have been
B	why who's the other one?
A	Hans Christian Andersen
B	what was they were before Grimms?
[ANNOTATION]	Person B want to know what is the day before Grimms	Neutral
A	no they were about the same time
B	well he was Danish wasn't he?
A	yeah no but
B	well Grimms did they make them up
A	no they
B	well yeah so
[ANNOTATION]	Person B is called the day that people make up each other Grimms	Neutral
A	yeah they well they are they are folk stories but
B	but it's I always imagined they're original works by them that they'd written
A	well
B	they added to them and
A	they have been changed
B	yeah
A	er no
[ANNOTATION]	Person A dont like that changed for people	Entailment
B	Hans Christian Andersen was his original? like The Ugly Duckling and stuff like that? I think it was wasn't it?
A	I think it was yeah
B	he he was a storyteller
A	but but the erm yeah
B	yeah
A	like they are kind of very much a product of Grimm
B	yeah
A	but yeah no I think
B	yeah I think he is original tales aren't they? stories
A	yeah
B	I've not been looking where we're going I don't think we would've passed it yet would we?
A	no hopefully not
B	Poison?
B	oh
A	Poison? imagine where are you from? oh I'm from Poison
A	I think erm
A	oh
B	did you see the
A	no
B	said something in another language it must be
A	oh no he wrote like Little Red Riding Hood and
B	yeah but he didn't write that did he?
A	yeah but he might've done I don't know
B	I thought that's a folk tale again
A	maybe
B	to make children
A	but we don't know if we he
A	yeah
B	what time was that?
A	erm
B	when were they?
A	dunno like
B	really?
A	seventeen hundreds maybe
B	yeah it is kinda the time I imagined or seventeenth
A	yeah
B	whatever it was
A	yeah
B	er it does sound yeah it does seem like
A	yeah
A	doesn't say anything about
A	we might've
B	really?
A	although no that was
B	oh is it we're there
A	although
B	oh why didn't you tell me
A	no it's
B	yeah
A	and then at the roundabout we need to take the third exit onto the
B	well there hasn't been any branch left yet?
A	no
B	er this is a turn rather than a branch
B	did you say that?
A	no
B	it's a funny
A	I know does anyone still
B	no the last woman died er so many years ago
A	no she died
B	must be still
A	yeah if they've still got yeah
B	must be still in existence but nobody's I suppose a linguist could
A	oh it's a dead language like Latin
A	do you think Ancient Greek is any different to normal Greek?
B	yeah it's a completely different language isn't it?
A	is it like Latin and English?
B	yeah I mean Latin
A	is it the same alphabet?
B	well Latin
A	yeah
A	oh right
A	it's just cos it's got the same name like Greek and Ancient Greek
B	yeah well
A	yeah
B	it's not like Latin is it?
A	no
B	but I know Latin
A	yeah
B	see that
A	yeah
B	maybe it's
A	but it doesn't have
B	do you want to have a look at my satnav again just stroll down
A	oh you've got a text do you want me to look at it?
B	no
A	where's that postcode gone?
B	will it not be in there somehow?
A	no you've got your history turned off
A	can't search
B	do you wanna try my satnav?
A	yeah maybe
B	I'm sure you know it's just to make as we get closer it might be
A	oh hang on
B	might need to get some fuel
A	go
B	what's going?
A	it's start navigation
B	oh right
B	any idea where we turn off?
A	erm we're going to
B	are we?
A	yeah
A	wow how long are we gonna be on this for?
B	we are on the
A	no on this map
B	why have we missed the turn off
A	we must've done
B	can't believe we've driven fifty miles
A	maybe not then but this is taking us a different way
B	well how could it change its mind so quick?
A	this satnav
B	yeah but you used that before didn't you?
A	no but that wasn't I that didn't say anything like I didn't look at the directions on that
B	on what?
A	on the satnav I didn't look at the directions before I just looked at the time
B	well why but why do you think it's taken us a different way?
B	oh right
A	no
B	would've been handy I should've stopped and looked at that one maybe
A	what?
B	should've stopped and looked at the map
A	do you want me to stop this satnav?
B	no
A	no
B	oh right well how did you see the
A	I've just got
B	for what?
A	then we'll arrive
B	what till we get there?
A	yeah
B	in
A	yeah
B	on I thought you meant till we turn off
A	no
B	oh right
B	really?
A	yeah
B	well how do you know it's taken us a different way?
A	because I've just looked through the directions
B	yeah
A	and what it's gonna tell us to do
B	yeah
A	and then
B	to the end?
A	and then we're gonna go onto the
B	oh right
A	and then we're gonna go take the first exit at the roundabout
B	well it might be worth just going down
A	do you want me to get your other satnav out?
B	yeah put that in and see what that says keep that one on as well
B	so we should be turning left here next left
A	I'm going I'm going
B	maybe we'll maybe we should follow that this turn off and then
A	yeah
B	what's the name of that place again?
A	oh
A	yeah
A	no search results
B	is there an address on it?
A	do I need to put a space?
B	probably
A	oh there we go
B	that was quick
A	shall I take this one off?
B	leave it on for a moment
A	oh street not digitised
B	that doesn't matter it's maybe the main road
A	it's just spinning
B	oh right is it? well that's not a good sign then is it?
A	it doesn't have a clue
A	it says we'll be there in thirty-four minutes
B	our satnav?
A	yeah
A	no cos it doesn't know where we are
B	well how can it know how long till we get there?
A	it doesn't it doesn't know what road we're on
B	yeah but
A	cos it knows where we are but it doesn't think we're on the road
A	according to this map that's where it's got the arrow over there in that field
B	that doesn't make any sense though
A	that's where it is
B	oh
A	sheep
B	eh?
A	thinks we're in that field look
B	oh well it's rubbish then isn't it? no point in us depending on that satnav
B	queue ahead?
A	doesn't seem to be queue
B	no maybe there is
B	yeah
A	then at
A	yeah so you're gonna branch left before you go to the roundabout
B	that
A	no
B	oh look at all these queues
A	that's probably why there's queues oh there's
A	wow look at that lake
B	I thought it was some massive thing
B	not very big is it?
B	so has anything happened on mine?
A	no
B	are we on the road now?
A	yeah
B	how long does it take?
A	thirty-three minutes
B	oh right
A	yeah shall I turn this one on?
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	The travel lasts 1 hour.	Contradiction
A	it'll be using your thing
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	no
B	eager for a
B	probably from the phone company telling me something
B	not looking cos it's stupid
A	if I see it then yeah but if not then no
B	off who?
A	dunno anyone
B	who's it from? did anyone say?
A	I didn't look
B	I've never had an SOS message so I'm not likely to get one
A	neither have I but you never know
B	could be
[ANNOTATION]	The speakers never receive an SOS text.	Entailment
B	yeah
A	cos you had to pay per word didn't you?
B	well per letter probably possibly character or
A	per letter
B	well yeah that's why
B	at the end of a sentence you'd have to
[ANNOTATION]	Being paid per word would bring more money.	Neutral
A	well
B	well yeah sentences yeah
A	that's why they put
B	no they they'd put a
A	no they would write stop
B	how
A	cos I I I know stuff about telegrams
B	no they wouldn't write stop
A	they would
B	well you mustn't be charged for that word
A	well maybe
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A is not in ignorance of telegrams.	Entailment
B	oh right
A	it would literally so stop so you'd know where the sentence stops
B	oh right
A	because you would have to type it out on like a Morse thing wouldn't you?
B	well
[ANNOTATION]	Code Morse is hard to learn.	Neutral
A	yeah
B	and then they they they would have a they just only used to have telegramming but they had telephones and they wouldn't use that
A	oh
B	they'd they'd still type a message out and have deliver it
A	yeah that's what I'm on about
[ANNOTATION]	People didn't have telephones at all, that's why they used telegrams.	Contradiction
B	yeah so well you'd still have the same thing in existence even when telephones existed
A	so how did they do it on telephone?
B	well you
A	oh and you'd tell them and they'd write it down?
B	yeah so they hand deliver it
A	oh
[ANNOTATION]	People working on it used to have very bad handwriting.	Neutral
B	erm
A	I don't know about that
B	to the person
A	I only know about the Morse one
B	oh right
A	cos you can't cos obviously you can't put full stops that means something in Morse
B	oh I see what you're saying yeah with the original er
A	so you have to put stop
B	telegrams yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	so you could ring up and give your message
A	oh
B	er you know if something urgent if
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Morse uses full stops.	Entailment
B	not necessarily that but yeah that was kind of
A	oh yeah
B	what's happening has somebody died or something?
[ANNOTATION]	B's father was used to sending telegrams.	Neutral
A	yeah I did say I said telegraph but then you started talking about telegrams
B	oh right
A	so then I thought oh it must be called a telegram
B	no the telegrams yeah that that was before telephone wasn't it? it was er before
A	yeah
A	but that'd take ages wouldn't it because it's like
A	isn't SOS dot dot dot dash dash dash dot dot dot?
B	well you you
[ANNOTATION]	Telegrams happened before the telephone.	Entailment
A	I think SOS is the only one I've ever learned and I think that's what it is
B	well yeah I
A	yeah yeah
B	oh right
A	and they taught us SOS and told us to remember that one
B	but now mobile phones are invented you don't
A	yeah no but you might not get erm
B	signal
A	yeah
B	yeah you're on a hill and you'll be flashing your light
A	oh yeah
B	shut the window
[ANNOTATION]	The window is open.	Entailment
B	it's good on
A	yeah but
B	do you think there's a thing there dot dot dot that you can?
A	oh can you imagine if that's what the breakdown phones are like? you have to send it in Morse
A	but didn't you see them? didn't they at one point have when a telegraph was coming through it like the machine would punch
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A did learn how to say SOS but doesn't remember anymore.	Contradiction
B	no that's a
A	oh
B	that's a different thing cos had
A	no
B	not sure
A	is that so the person wouldn't have to listen? so carefully?
B	I've no idea I don't know what
A	cos it would be a dot or a dash
B	oh right
A	I don't know
B	like Braille?
A	maybe
B	well
B	it's better that you can actually read it rather than touching it
B	oh right
A	and I I
B	mm
A	and also
B	yeah
A	blind people know that the road's coming up
B	yeah
A	I was
B	yeah
A	that's probably why it is
B	suppose unless we need to know we don't really pay much attention
A	yeah
B	oh look hills in the distance
A	where?
B	they've gone behind
B	trees
B	yeah that turn off's still not come up has it? strange
A	basically just carry on and don't bear left
A	thanks for that
B	what road are we on? are we on the
A	yeah
B	mm
A	that title
B	oh really?
A	yeah
B	mm
A	it comes from there
B	oh right
A	but like it
B	did you not?
A	no have you read it?
B	is it? no it's not a
A	yeah
B	oh we're only nineteen miles now
A	I thought it was quite interesting
B	yeah
A	mm
B	yeah I should make the effort to try and start reading some
A	yeah then they're just rubbish
B	yeah well they're readable
A	yeah
A	but if you go for erm
B	from where?
A	Amazon
B	oh really?
A	yeah like
B	okay
A	some of them like what have I got? I got erm
B	actually you know classics are
A	yeah
B	classic you know I've really loved
A	slow
B	well
A	yeah
B	the satisfaction out of it that you
A	like a page turner?
B	yeah depends what you're reading for doesn't it?
A	oh
A	even among classic readers
B	I think I've read a a certain amount of pages but
A	like
B	the thing is the book the prose is really thick and
A	it's basically a guy that has to hunt whales
B	yeah but I could find it
B	you know I could see why that might have its interest but
A	do you think?
B	but the words are the book I've bought for really cheaply
B	and the the words are tiny
A	if you enjoyed
B	oh right
A	it's like one of the first kind of proper like detective novels I think
B	what is it an old one?
A	yeah
B	oh right
A	it was like
B	it's about what?
A	it's about a
A	take the
B	maybe I should've turned left there and it didn't tell me
A	er oh
B	this
B	so
A	I know
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	oh it's back on now is it? fourteen miles maybe I should just follow the signs
A	yeah
B	tell me where to turn off then go back to that
A	yeah
B	when we get close to it
A	no it's back here
B	look there's a left turn here
A	probably yeah
B	but it didn't say turn left did it? maybe this is quite a new
A	what?
B	that where we have to turn off left
B	yeah
A	er that's right at the bottom that's
A	at roundabout take second exit onto
A	but that's after you've
A	that's quite a while
B	look more wind
A	oh
B	there's the
A	oh yeah
A	I always call them windmills cos you call them windmills
B	why
B	what?
A	yeah
A	I called them windmills in my French lesson
B	cos I think
A	and it's a turbine it's not a mill
B	oh right
A	and people were like why are you going on about windmills? and I was like cos windmills they're like no it's wind turbine and I was like
A	yeah you
B	oh right
A	so I
B	yeah a windmill it it it the old flour and so on and stuff
A	it's a mill yeah
B	well the operation the wind turns the sails doesn't it? I think
A	right
B	you may as well it doesn't seem to working right does it?
A	yeah
B	really? is it on voice thing now?
A	yeah well it said I clicked on the settings then it said mute so I'm guessing it's on loud
B	alright yeah
A	oh right
B	just about had enough fuel to get here
B	yeah look at those hills they look really weird
A	yeah
B	like kind of pointed aren't they?
B	yeah
A	ash or something going down the side
B	I don't know
B	it's to do with where you are in the
A	oh yeah
B	and you have to be on that line I guess don't you?
A	oh yeah we don't really have any do we? but it's funny because
B	I think
A	yeah because isn't it like?
B	they're only in a certain part of the world
A	yeah because I think like hills are formed something like where it's been pushed together isn't it like the land? so
B	or it's been by the river
A	yeah
B	over billions of years the river
A	yeah
B	creates a valley
A	yeah
B	can we turn left here?
A	duh duh duh duh duh
B	gotta figure out what the sign means left for
A	I think so
B	looks like it
A	er
B	is this it yeah? is this that turn off we were supposed to be looking for? yeah
B	no leave it on cos we're not far
A	use the left lane to take the
B	the
B	is it American that voice?
A	I don't know
B	like where where is he now third?
B	yeah
B	signed anyway
A	one
B	why?
A	to make sure we get the right one
B	I can't believe it it it started like
A	yeah it was like boom
B	I'm getting
B	we'll have enough to get there I think
A	we'll have to call your pick ups out
A	your
B	what did he say do now?
B	we're coming up to something
A	oh is it?
B	that's what the sign says what's the sign gonna say?
A	it should say it again
B	it should tell you there now
A	it it's showing you there don't know what that is
B	that's not
A	is it the third?
B	well that says
A	mm mm
A	oh well it'll redirect you
A	yeah
B	this seems like this seems like it should be the way we should've gone
A	yeah
B	well it might take us a
A	yeah
B	is it saying any different time or anything?
A	no
A	yeah me and mummy always count the roundabout stops to make sure we get the right one
B	yeah
A	cos sometimes it's not clear
B	I kind of in my head just look at them
B	I don't go one two three and all that
B	but you yeah you just pay attention which
A	is that a? these bends are a bit sharp aren't they you can't even see what's coming round the corner
B	mm?
A	all the cyclists
A	yeah
A	oh I like those bushes
A	are they hydrangeas?
B	don't know
A	they're like erm
B	same thing then
A	although
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	were they not chrysanthemums?
B	do they look I dunno
B	oh okay
A	do you not know much about flowers?
B	I know what a rose looks like
B	oh it's on empty now
A	I don't know that much about flowers
B	yeah but you probably know more than me
A	yeah
B	I could recognise a daffodil a tulip a daisy a rose
A	no
B	yeah
A	water lily
B	showing off now aren't you?
A	I like foxgloves
B	they're poisonous
A	not if you don't eat them
B	no
B	what's that? see it?
A	ooh wow it's an eagle
B	is that an eagle?
B	probably a seagull
A	no it was an eagle it was grey
