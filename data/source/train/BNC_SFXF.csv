B	I don't know if I've put the volume up
A	yeah it wasn't that far really

B	no
A	why?
B	well if it's about TV or famous people
A	mm yeah
B	you need a couple of those
A	yeah yeah you've got to mix it up a bit
B	you just told yourself that you've got here
B	yeah it's pathetic isn't it?
A	looks like a erm one of those flat pack cars that you put together yourselves
B	A kit car?
A	mm
B	yeah
A	I don't know
B	no it's a Toyota
A	mm?
B	well that's what the wheel says anyway
A	well you have to buy some sort of wheels
B	no but it looks like a Toyota
A	does it?
B	yeah
A	how old is that?
B	eighties?
A	mm
B	I don't understand those two seaters
A	I know
B	yeah
A	you know
B	mm
A	can't get out all on her own
B	mm
A	but she can't
B	mm
A	so it's a bit useless really
B	well it's big enough for her and her dog isn't it?
A	yeah
B	it looks nice
A	what's happened?  What's happened?
B	when she came to meet us at Heathrow at that hotel
A	oh yeah
B	and then they they and then we had to go to the pub
A	that was an absolute nightmare
B	and they were like okay do you mind walking? Cos we've only got a two seater
A	and then we got stuck at the bus as well
B	yeah we did
A	Cos nobody could come pick us up in these two seater cars
B	yeah yeah
A	know what I was going to say? Is what happened about his car the other day? Cos I didn't hear all the news
B	mm
A	Cos he said it
B	no
A	why was he parked behind a palette?
B	I don't know
A	oh my god
B	and I think it it went through half of the engine as well
A	really?
B	and it's destroyed it
A	oh really
B	which is good
A	why?
B	well cos he'd lose his no claims wouldn't he
A	mm
B	erm so they've
A	so they're going to pay for it?
B	yeah they've put it into the garage
A	mm
B	they'll pay for everything
A	yep
B	so
A	it just depends on how long it's going to take to fix it
B	mm
A	who's fixing it? Somebody at work?
B	no
A	okay
B	I don't know with
A	mm
B	things might go wrong more frequently
A	mm
B	I don't know
A	no who knows? He'll buy a new car then won't he?
B	no
A	oh okay
B	no no god no
A	what banger?
B	he bought a little thing
A	did he? I'm getting really confused now
B	he's got a little run around car
A	they picked us up in the nice car
B	yeah that big four by four looking thing
A	oh right
B	which they stuck on credit
A	mm
B	no
A	we're funny aren't we cos we're
B	I don't know
A	I do quite like it
B	but I don't
A	but I do feel like I'm missing out sometimes on like a car or something like that
B	yeah
A	that's because we haven't got any friends
B	any then I realised I haven't got any batteries
A	what without it being switched on?
B	no I think it was switched on but
A	but you haven't looked at it
B	I haven't looked at it
A	yeah that's true
B	and and I don't know anyone who lives around here so I'm not exactly phoning anyone up saying oh do you fancy a pint? or whatever
A	no
B	yeah I need to get out of here
A	well I think tomorrow
B	it is it is crunch day tomorrow
A	erm if they don't contact us tomorrow I'm going to phone them
B	yeah
A	I nearly thought about phoning them today but I thought I'd wait for London correspondence
B	yeah cos ten o'clock will be what? Two o'clock there
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	definitely
B	yeah yeah I'll phone
A	yeah
B	we have got his number haven't we?
A	yep yeah we have got his number
B	er
A	that's weird isn't it? There's that little bit of
B	mm
A	it's weird isn't it?
B	mm
A	it's cos I don't use it very often
B	yeah
A	I'm not really a phone person
B	mm
A	but it made me think
B	mm
A	erm cos I don't like phones and things like that
B	mm
A	I like face to face better
B	yeah well me too
A	I find there's oh there's
B	mm
A	you just always feel like I've said something weird or they've not understood me
A	oh and they just
B	mm
A	I don't know
B	mm
A	whereas on this Facebook and stuff and on the telephone I find it really hard
B	mm mm
A	I find it really hard to
B	well I'm absolutely sick of Facebook
A	no don't close it because it's good for the old correspondents
B	oh god
A	why?
B	just irritates me
A	yeah I know
B	just the crap people put on it
A	well it's annoying there's so many other people and they're using it and and then
B	and then
A	like some people if you if you they don't get a message from you or from somebody they're they're offended
B	mm
A	and it's like well I haven't been on it for for two weeks or
B	yeah
A	why would I have sent you a message?
B	and then I I keep getting sent all these fucking things saying oh poor little
A	mm
B	pass this on otherwise you're a selfless bastard
A	mm
B	it's like for god sake
A	yeah it's horrible that people
B	yeah that's what it's like
A	but that doesn't mean like
B	well
A	it's just
B	it's idiotic
A	oh dear that's not very nice at all is it
B	well they don't now in this country
A	even even people who are religious they say it's okay if you want to pray at home
B	mm
A	the whole history
B	and if you've had
A	yeah I know it's not good
B	and then it's right there next to your new one so you've got all this history which is directly tied to the present and you can't escape it
A	yeah
B	I mean some people must be having nightmares with that
A	yeah
B	I don't like at all because it it it colours the the new message
A	it just pops up
B	it's not a fresh message
A	no
A	and I didn't speak to her since then
B	I'm going into the jungle cos I'm having a rough time
A	yeah do you remember? When we were in China and we said right
A	and we went we just travelled for days
B	we travelled about three thousand miles
A	and then finally got to to Sumatra and went in the jungle and sat there
B	yeah that was
A	but that was because we were enjoying
A	but she was off
B	oh it must have been
A	six
B	five years ago
A	yeah
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	and she doesn't either obviously
B	yeah and every time you message her she's going to go oh god yeah she never did bloody write to me in that jungle thing
A	no I mine was the last message so I'm pleased that mine was the last message cos
B	right
A	no but but that on the plus side you've you have got these
B	that that is the only plus side is that I've got into touch with people that I thought I'd lost
A	people that you can
B	but it was only
A	well it depends on you doesn't it?
B	well is there a way of getting their email address?
A	yeah
B	well I could ask for them couldn't I
A	I hardly use email these days
B	well no one does do they
A	apart
B	writing
A	I don't do anything like that
B	you don't even write anything
A	I don't do too much of that crap
A	I only do that
B	yeah
A	you know most of my friends wouldn't give two monkeys
B	but there's no effort is there
A	oh I like their picture
B	yeah but you can't live your life if you're trying to please people who care about stuff you couldn't give two hoots about
A	no I know
B	but if you look at half of your friends on Facebook I bet you don't give a damn about half of those people
A	no no I should clean it up really
B	but then you can't
A	it is really weird
B	why don't you want it?
A	because there's something about it
B	I haven't even looked at it
A	and erm them recording your
B	mm
A	right
B	but who gives a shit? Who gives a shit what I was doing last September?
A	what were you doing? It's it's basically a diary of your life
B	so you're looking in other people's diaries?
A	it's a diary with photos
B	well a diary with entries of five words at a time
A	but it but all the photos
B	yeah
A	yeah well I hate it
B	yeah
A	they were talking about making everybody do it but I don't know if that's true
B	well it will eventually won't it
A	I don't want it though
B	but they have to keep changing it that's the whole purpose
A	but I don't want it to change because once I know how to use something then I just want it to continue
B	mm
A	and like and you're supposed to know that
B	mm
A	if you've got security settings to say they can't look at my pictures then it should be stuck
B	mm
A	mm
B	well
A	we'd be arrested
B	well we did get cut off didn't we
A	like why why does it matter? Why does it matter that they have the information?
B	yeah because it basically have you heard that all of this stuff is going to these big vaults in the North Pole?
A	yeah yeah I've heard that
B	where you've got these underground storage facilities
A	such a big hard drive
B	but can you imagine the marketing possibilities
A	yeah but can you believe that they spend all of this
B	that's that's what it's about
A	but can you believe that this kind of marketing can produce so much revenue and so much money that it's worth it
B	well no because it's it's producing nothing
B	all
A	well it's seeing what kind of abstract shit people like
B	so if it's generating ideas or
A	mm
B	but when you're generating like marketing stuff that's just generating greed
A	mm
B	I don't know and then you've got all of these financial products
A	but Tom you've got to be really careful on your Google because I was on I was on it right
B	yeah
A	right
B	oh has it?
A	now it's just WWW but if you want high security
B	mm
A	it's now
B	what the phone number?
A	as soon as you sign into Google
B	it wants your phone number
A	no
B	hmm
A	to them building a profile of you
B	yeah
A	but HTTP used to be a normal thing that you used to see
B	mm
A	so now they're now on my Hotmail it flashes up
B	mm
A	it used to be that
B	hmm
A	with all of your data
B	mm
A	and storing while you're logged into Google
B	mm
A	and I'm stopping using Google Chrome
B	well I've noticed cos I was trying to do something the other day I can't remember what but I had to find out where Google Chrome was storing all of the information
A	mm
B	and it isn't it's not like Internet Explorer
A	storing what?
B	well storing the the cookies and all of the other stuff
A	well cos yeah with Google Chrome you have to delete it from the computer and then you delete it from the Google Chrome site as well
B	it's really weird
A	yeah
B	but I don't know
A	yeah
B	yeah but you know people would say oh that's convenient
A	it's not convenient because I because they're the companies that we don't want
B	mm
A	it's ridiculous
B	yeah
A	but that's why you've got to be really careful with Google now
B	mm
A	and now I think we should change to
B	well it's like
A	I don't like Google anymore
B	internet Explorer's really clunky and it's just horrible
A	clunky?
B	yeah
A	they're all the same
B	no they're not
A	really?
B	it looks ugly
A	well Mozilla Fox then
B	yeah okay
A	and you've just got to make sure that you always sign out from your Google account
B	mm
A	Cos of those
B	and I liked the Google one because
A	yeah
B	well only because we're here
A	well there was a glitch wasn't there
B	and I've got direct I've got a direct link to my email as well
A	mm
B	yeah
A	you only have to go on the Google homepage and it says gmail at the top
B	oh okay
A	no
B	okay
A	shall we? Are we going to walk back now?
B	are we going to have another one or are we walking back?
A	no
B	mm
A	it's nice I like it
B	it is a nice pub
A	if we go and speak to them in the pub and say hello and find out about the quiz and
B	well it says Wednesday
A	I know but we can say hello and say goodbye
B	yeah
A	yeah?
B	yeah okay
[ANNOTATION]	That they other person will say hello and goodbye.	Neutral
