D	and
B	Clarkson's oldest
A	Clarkson's clearly the oldest
B	yeah
D	is he?
A	yeah
D	well
A	he looks
B	but perhaps it's
C	James May does not give that impression
B	he gives the impression of being quite old
D	I dunno
B	whereas Clarkson is just a grumpy old man
C	captain Slow
A	he's probably about forty
B	I reckon about that
C	forty?
A	whereas Clarkson's probably about fifty-five or

A	mm
D	mm

A	the first rule of house is mum is always right

A	you've got the white one and I have not got the white one
A	is it still going strong?
C	oh yes
A	the old San Francisco from Orange
C	I'm feeling like
A	mm
C	updated it
A	I I I voided within a
C	I wasn't
A	day of buying it
C	I wasn't too pissed off about how it was working at the  at the  time
A	yeah
C	working alright
A	it is there's quite an involved process
C	yeah
A	I was quite surprised
B	hm
C	no
A	I just followed a few instructions
C	but it was successful?
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	what do you mean all of the applications?
C	like I turn
A	what ones you you the ones you've installed?
C	um
C	crap it's starting up
A	you mean it  it
C	it's like switching on a computer
B	mm
C	and it opening every single program
A	but but when you say starting up do you mean like actually comes on the screen as if you  as if you  just pressed the the icon?
C	no
A	yeah but that's how Android does stuff
C	but it doesn't do stuff because there's so much crap running in the background
C	that
A	well mine's like that as well when you first start it up
C	no it's you you
A	Cos with Android you don't need to
C	you go onto Task Manager
A	yeah you don't need to do that with Android though
C	as soon as you're doing that
A	really?
C	it speeds up massively
A	are you
C	mm
A	well it might just be because one of the ones that's running is
A	a silly process that's like very processor intensive
C	I dunno
A	you shouldn't in in
C	I haven't got that
A	right
C	it's
A	it uses all the memory cos that's the best thing to do
C	maybe
D	does anyone mind if I have a second bun?
C	that's this is why I'm considering routing it
B	no you've I've got some toast instead
C	but um
B	mm
C	oh oh oh
C	well right
B	that's not gonna help it
C	right
A	oh that's not right
C	gallery
A	that is part of the
B	mm
C	Google Mail
A	why do they all start up?
C	maps
A	and they're all running from the start?
C	messages
A	yeah
C	my Upload
C	photo
D	to us to be honest
C	something called TouchPal
A	and that's all running?
C	yeah
A	that is kind of weird
B	mm
C	yeah
A	I think you should route it
C	I suspect I should
C	and save battery
A	how many sausages were there each?
C	I dunno
D	three
B	three
A	so that's mine then
B	yes if you'd like
A	oh one more
C	had another ostrich burger on Sunday
B	mm
C	it was very nice
A	they're quite good there aren't they
C	mm
A	I like them
C	yeah
A	when I was
B	well
A	in Australia I had quite a lot of kangaroo burgers
C	or well the first time I had one was when we were
B	mm
C	up in the market
B	mm
C	yeah
A	we ate quite a lot of kangaroo in Australia
C	mm
B	I
A	Cos it's cheap
B	yeah I sort of assumed that you wouldn't eat a lot of it
A	no it's actually
B	yeah
A	yeah you'd think it would be like a a sort of novelty sort of thing
B	mm
A	yeah it's really common
B	oh right
A	just buy it in the supermarket
B	mm
A	buy kangaroo sausages burgers steaks in the supermarket
B	mm
A	just like you would beef or lamb
C	mhm
B	hm
C	I mean I have to say that that is the only flaw I I find on the phone
B	hm
A	mm
C	I have to spend
A	mm
C	a couple of minutes killing everything
A	it's weird that all that stuff would start up in the first place
C	mm
A	Cos memory management's so good
A	are there different sorts of sausages?
B	yeah
A	this one tastes really nice
B	pork and something
A	yeah
B	mm
A	fruity or herbal or something
B	yep
A	mm
B	yeah cos um the other ones are just pork
D	yeah
C	mm
D	herbs
B	I know you don't like a herb in a brekkie sausage
D	no I just wondered what sort of shit you've put into it
B	oh right
C	mm
A	you're very particular about your breakfast sausages
D	mm
B	you like sort of sixty percent bread for
D	yeah
B	but does anyone want any?
C	alright catch me a Cut-Me-Own-Throat Dibbler
B	hm?
C	cut-Me-Own-Throat Dibbler
A	no
C	he's an itinerant salesperson
B	mhm
C	unless it's sausage in a bun
B	right
C	sausage in a bun
B	mhm
C	um
D	there's a film here called Fightville

C	you did actually watch it
B	no I watched
C	oh it's
C	it's
B	I did watch
C	damn
B	I'm actually more a
C	four letters
C	very similar words
B	it was quite good
C	mm
B	I think it's just
B	films
C	yeah
B	but each to their own
D	mm
D	hm
B	hm? What's Fightville about?
C	he's doing it again
A	grunting?
A	well that's not  That was more of an interesting sort of hm
C	yeah
A	than a ah
C	yeah that one wasn't
B	at the end of the day you're gonna produce a report on the different types of grunting noise
A	mm
B	sighs
A	grunting message from
D	mm
A	no there's no need to repeat cos it's all on that  it's all on that  little recorder anyway
B	mm
A	so
D	oh we taped it
B	any signs of it that it is?
A	yeah
C	yeah
C	conduct a study into
B	what's it about?
D	no idea
C	what's in Ingenia?
A	oh
C	oh the airship renaissance
A	yep
C	I've seen that written about
A	it's quite interesting
C	quite a while ago
A	yeah
C	but um
C	but I think this is something similar to the to what I read about before
A	it would be quite funny if they started calling it the renaissance
C	sorry?
A	it would be quite funny if they just abbreviated it just to the renaissance
C	mm
A	you read NCE?
C	mm
C	it's not the most amazing publication
A	says it's  says it's  written very badly sometimes
C	yeah
A	lots of grammatical errors and things
C	sometimes you can tell that um it's an unsuccessful edit
A	yeah
C	they thought oh and it we need to cut this
A	mm
C	but they accidentally left a word in or something actually
B	mm
C	or or or something like that
B	yes
A	yeah
B	oh
C	hm
A	Don't you want them?
C	hm?
B	if you don't want them leave them and we can either eat them now or
C	I could have
A	what cos there's no bread you mean?
C	yeah
B	there's there's
A	or just bread presumably
B	no it's frozen bread
A	oh it's frozen? Oh
C	um
B	I could
C	I could try
B	you could try
A	oh
C	no I'm just
B	for some reason I had in my head there was two
C	not particularly energized
B	buns each
C	mm rooibos
B	one or two slices?
C	hm?
B	one or two slices?
C	um
B	two
C	I envy you having a freezer
A	just empty it
A	just take all the stuff out and leave it on
B	yeah
A	and put your own stuff in
B	unless it's all frozen in there so hard that you can't prise it out
A	mm
C	so we're none of us are continuing in that house after the twelve months expires
A	well it sounds pretty dreadful
C	mm
D	yeah but you like having something to complain about
C	complain about other stuff
A	complain about you
B	aw
D	just harsh
B	oh this T-shirt's nice
D	it's merino wool
