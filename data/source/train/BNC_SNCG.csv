A	is the counter moving?
B	yep the counter is moving
A	hooray
A	now Simon doesn't say turn here but I'm gonna turn here anyway cos you know
B	yeah I think if we just go back to
B	she looks thrilled with the joys of
B	right
B	here we go and if we turn right we're all good back on track
A	okay
B	so it's
B	mm
A	yeah
B	yeah turn right
A	okay
B	motorway's down there somewhere erm
A	oh hold on my door isn't closed properly I wondered what that noise was
A	oops
B	oh oh
A	right don't drive into the bus okay and relax
A	right so we're there groovy so we're going
A	this way this road is the seventy-three isn't it? I know exactly where I am
B	okay
A	that's cool
B	I'm gonna tell you about Saturday night
A	oh lovely
A	okay cos it's
B	today yes
A	okay so how was the party?
B	really nice
A	oh good
B	really Polish
A	good
B	you know
A	this is true mm
B	erm you know and it was just really nice erm
A	what do you mean by nice?
B	well you know lots of people all together
B	chatting and drinking it was just really nice and his friends were really nice and there was music and and
A	Polish music? or?
B	no
A	okay
B	erm cos I went to the flat and I thought it was just
A	ah
B	erm and I was like cos I know that
A	mm
B	erm
B	as mums do and I didn't realise that they lived with her
A	ah right
B	yeah still er and I suppose you know they're saving for their own house
A	yeah
B	but I don't know if you agree with me that if I was married or if I was in a
B	er
A	or a garage or a shed
B	than live with my parents
A	yeah
B	with my
A	I agree
B	you know with my partner I think you know it's awful blowing all that money when you're trying to save for a house but
A	yeah
B	I
A	it seems a little bit different here and in Germany in that people tend to build their own house
B	mm
A	erm or buy a house you know pretty much outright they don't bother with mortgages
B	mm
A	and in the meantime they rent or more likely in Poland yeah they live with their parents
B	yeah
A	I've got German friends that erm actually I haven't got any German friends who live with their parents now they all rent but then rents are fairly cheap and the market is makes it very easy for
B	uhu
A	for people to rent and there are
B	mm
A	a lot of folks live at home er you know even single folks in Poland seem to live at home in their
B	yeah
A	thirties forties
B	yeah
A	mm
A	yeah how old's he? he's gotta be
B	thirty-two
A	is that? oh is he really that young?
B	yeah
A	god yeah okay
B	er and then he does have his own place but it's in
A	yeah
B	so he can
A	yeah I suppose it's just a you know a cultural difference
B	cultural difference yeah
A	yeah
B	if you live on your own I think it's okay but I mean if you're single I think it's okay but if you're married I just
A	yeah I know
B	I remember saying to a student last year a little boy in conversation club how many people live in your house? and he was like nine people
A	oh my goodness
B	and it's you know him and his brother and his mum and dad and their mum and dad and his cousins and his auntie and uncle
A	wow
B	you know and er I imagine it's a very big house but
A	mm that's a bit like Ireland maybe a couple of generations ago
B	mm
A	and Scotland actually I don't know about England probably not
B	mm I don't think the houses are big enough
A	no but even in I'm thinking about erm my father-in-law who's eighty-three grew up in Scotland and
B	yeah yeah
A	erm and likewise with my mother-in-law who's eighty-eight something like that eighty-seven eighty-eight erm she lived in
B	mm
A	I suppose that's not so applicable these days
B	no
A	mm
B	you know they're very family oriented more than in England
A	yeah that's true
B	I always feel weird saying that like you know in England people don't care about their family
B	but it's just a different relationship isn't it?
A	yes
B	a stronger relationship
A	I never hugged my family I didn't realise that's what people did
B	mm
A	and then
B	yeah
A	and then I started hugging them which I think they were a bit shocked by
B	ah
A	they seem to have warmed up to it so now they just sort of expect a hug and they get one yeah
B	how embarrassing
A	I know I let him overtake cos it takes me a while to get up to speed
B	yeah that's true
A	speak up a bit for our recording
B	isn't it strange building a motorway but with only two lanes?
A	yeah
B	mm
A	right through to erm going up to
B	yeah
A	a major yeah huge and it was two lanes and I remember my dad telling me cos I was a kid when it was built but my dad told me that there were all of these studies at the time about erm the volume of traffic and what was anticipated in the coming decades and they didn't really have a clue so
B	mm yeah they must've just
A	yeah they do more works on it now but er
A	put three lanes in at some of the peak places
B	yeah
A	wow
B	to cos it gets really really congested erm
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	and there's loads of speed cameras
A	oh god yeah
B	so you've really gotta take your time
B	I was yeah
A	ah
B	his girlfriend is Romanian and they met on the CELTA course
A	ah lovely
B	erm nice yeah and they both live in
A	I can understand that
B	er and he kind of likes it
A	ah
B	erm but they're talking about moving
A	wow
B	and she wants to go back to Portugal
A	god what a difference Portugal or
B	I know Portugal to Poland
A	yeah
B	it's like
A	yeah definitely
B	erm so that was nice they were nice
A	which is nice
B	which is nice
A	yes talk words
B	er and then my student
A	mm
B	did I tell you this story? I shall tell you again for the benefit of our listeners cos it's funny er you've met
B	no here
A	oh yes
B	big guy
A	yeah
B	quiet speaks English with like a posh accent
A	okay
B	that he's got from I don't know where
A	yeah
B	erm
A	mm
B	erm and
A	oh wow
B	er and
A	I'm ah right
B	and he thought
A	ah
B	after twelve years in prison
A	oh that's funny
B	I was like twelve years in prison? you it's like I dunno killing someone you'd get something like twelve years
A	yeah yeah
B	erm you know he's so quiet and he doesn't really say much and he's quite shy erm
A	that's funny
B	you know and he just thought he was
A	so a little bit lost in translation there wasn't it?
B	yeah so I really took the piss out of
A	ah
B	er it was funny you know he's just so sort of gentle
A	yeah
B	I dunno how he would work in a prison he bakes cakes
A	ah
B	and ballroom dances and is a master beekeeper
A	oh wow that's cool
B	erm and he has all of these hobbies and he's you know he's single and he's just
A	gay?
B	no I don't think so
A	no
B	I don't think so I don't know and just really sort of sweet er erm and
A	and not a murderer
B	and not a murderer
A	yeah
B	so that's a good that's a good
A	which is nice
B	yeah so he was there and
A	uhu
B	er and then yeah other assorted friends
A	wow
B	so identical there's five years between them four years between them
A	goodness
B	erm identical er
B	er
A	mm
B	his brother's twenty-four like me er and he lives in
A	oh my god
B	the arse end of nowhere
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	wow
B	erm and
A	so he did come back for
B	he'd come back for
B	oh I like living in
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	well the beer's
B	yep you know and what's the difference between Polish young people and English young people? they didn't have a lot of positive things to say
B	er
A	oh for fuck's sake
B	I was like I am not talking to you any more
A	yeah
B	goodbye and I just like it really got to me because I was thinking the Muslims who live in
A	I know
B	British people with British passports I was like
A	yeah
B	you're the immigrant
A	yeah
B	you're the person who shouldn't be there if no one er you know if someone's not supposed to be there it's you
A	how did they respond to that?
B	I didn't say that I just went
A	oh you maybe should've done for god's sake
B	I know and one of them was like
A	there seems to be so much
B	what do you think about it? all of these people in England? and I was like but they're
A	jeez even if they're not English what's the problem?
B	yeah I don't know where they get this racism from
A	I think
A	it's all based on fear this whole austerity story to my mind is a complete fabrication to divide and conquer it's to set humanity against humanity
B	yeah
A	so Cameron and pals go along fleecing people of all their money and power and all the rest of it and meanwhile poor people are fighting poor people it's all bollocks
B	yeah
A	but anyway they've obviously swallowed a story so
B	yeah but they're told you know in the news that these people are bad and they hate them
A	yeah
B	even though especially Polish people in Poland have never met anyone who's not white
A	I know
B	it just it blows my socks off
A	yeah or maybe never met someone who's not Christian or
A	yeah
B	erm
A	I know I think if people form their opinions of other people on how they actually find other people through their own direct experience
B	yeah
A	then in my experience of human beings is that we all want to love and be loved we all want the best for our family
B	yeah
A	we all want to have enough of everything and we generally do
B	yep
A	you know I worked at charitable organisations where people are living in extreme poverty and so it does exist it does exist in
B	uhu
A	in
B	yeah
A	so anyway anyway I'm preaching to the converted with you I know
B	I just thought it was
A	yeah
B	this you know this man who and they must have pretty miserable lives in England you know they work long hours in a meat factory
A	yeah
B	and I just think you know I know that you don't want to be there and you know want to come and live
A	yeah
B	the things that you're gonna do in the future even if it means that you're fucking miserable while you're doing it
A	yeah I know
B	and it's
A	yeah
B	like what's the point?
A	I know
B	I'd rather be I'd rather
A	yeah
B	I dunno
A	I don't know I think I've changed a lot erm end of the nineties my mum got a terminal cancer diagnosis and being around her and watching how she lived her life really influenced me I think and I live very much
B	yeah
A	in the moment now
B	yeah
A	then when my partner got terminal cancer diagnosis you know just kind of reinforces that when everybody you love is been you know given a death sentence
B	yeah
A	well we've all got a death sentence from the moment we're born really
B	yeah
A	but if if
A	you know if you know it's gonna be kind of sooner rather than later then
B	yeah mm
A	I do think it changes how you perceive reality and your priorities
B	I had erm a question from my students we were talking ambitions and bucket lists and dreams and this kind of thing and the first question was is life boring?
A	oh
B	er and I think it's er
A	mm no there's a third one but anyway
B	okay oh well to say
A	just being awkward
B	yeah well tell me in a minute and I think in some ways it is you know you're waking up at the same time eating the same breakfasts and going to work er or if you're a student you're going to school every day and it can be very boring erm and at the same time of course it's not boring there's so many exciting things for you to do er and you can make life interesting and you can meet new people and laugh at jokes and tell stories and all of these things make life interesting
A	yeah
B	so I don't know what's your third?
B	yeah
A	and it's only a human perception
B	it's not really answering the question
A	well it is and I think it's a really important answer to the question it's like you know technically speaking
B	yeah
A	there is no good or and there is no evil there are only perceptions of how you feel about certain events so
B	yeah
A	really if you take humans and er our own subjective perceptions out of the equation it neither is or isn't
B	yeah
A	and I I do think we have as humans this built-in kind of indicator I mean we have this whole rainbow of emotions this whole spectrum but it all boils down to does it feel good? or not?
B	yeah
A	and if it does then great do more of that and so yeah boredom is just one aspect of that
B	mm
A	doesn't feel so great
B	yes
A	so how was yesterday? do you want to talk about
A	no?
B	no I do but I might cry
A	oh okay
B	er
A	would you rather not cry while being recorded? or?
B	I'm not bothered
A	okay fair enough
B	er I just sort of
B	erm
A	yeah
B	er so he said nothing
A	he said nothing? he didn't have a view? or
B	no no his answer was er in the question all or nothing he chose nothing
A	oh in the question he chose nothing
B	he didn't sort of sit in
A	oh okay
B	I'm gonna take a vow of silence until you leave
A	just talk amongst yourself
A	okay
B	er so
A	wow
B	but
A	well I suppose if
B	I think it's the better outcome it's the er saddest right now but
A	yeah
B	next week it'll feel even better
A	yeah
B	well yeah exactly now I know where I stand and I can
A	yeah
B	make my choices and make my decisions er
A	yeah
B	based on that so it's good it's good good
A	good
B	yeah I
A	and I didn't say that to you in so many words before you went to
B	yeah
A	swayed by my view anyway I don't
B	no and
B	uhu
A	he's
B	yeah
A	so
B	no no it's fine now like
A	yeah
B	it is what it is
A	yeah exactly it is what it is and I suppose
B	oh absolutely
A	but we're just gonna have a good day today
B	yes
A	you're gonna be surrounded by friends and people who love you and who are supportive of you and
B	yes
A	we're gonna ski and we're gonna have nice food and
B	yes are you skiing today?
A	go to the spa
B	yeah
A	and erm you're gonna go off with
B	yeah
A	and have some lunch with a woman at her house
B	uhu
A	that involves things that have been killed
B	yeah
A	and I've bought myself a one person portion curry out of the freezer
B	uhu
A	so I'll
B	uhu oh I don't know how I feel about skiing in the dark
A	oh well I presume they'll put some lights on
B	no
B	it's not gonna be pitch black
A	we're not gonna need a head torch we'll be alright you know
B	I might not ski today
A	mm
B	and just come and sit and read my book
A	yeah do you feel like you need any time alone to process the events of yesterday?
B	no
A	okay
B	because
B	it's raining
A	it is raining and you've been lunging down
B	and I've been lunging
B	and I just think er it's probably not a good decision er
A	yeah
B	er and if I can get wi-fi somewhere I can try and send these reports on my phone
A	yeah
B	er
A	yeah
B	and then tomorrow I'll be fresh
A	I have to admit the most attractive thing all of this for me is the spa
B	I am so excited
A	I love a spa I love I
B	have you brought your cossie?
A	I bloody hope so I think it was the first thing in the case
B	it was the first thing in my case but then I repacked and then
A	ah okay
B	I
A	yeah go naked
A	yeah
A	that were black and like a big erm vest thing that sort of goes under a blouse and
B	yeah
A	she just kind of managed to bluff it which was good and kept her towel on a lot but
B	yeah
A	yeah it was bluffable it was good
A	and I thought as well I know being off the booze I've never been to a spa and not
B	not been drank in yeah Prosecco
A	yeah exactly so yeah that was and er while I was in Lidl I nearly lifted a a couple of bottles of bubbles but anyway we will cope it'll be a new experience
B	and I'm totally up for February as well
A	oh yeah?
B	for sure er if not
A	okay
B	forever
B	I really don't think it's for me
A	yeah
B	er and you know at the party they were all like don't do it don't extend it and I just thought why? it's nothing to do with you
A	exactly
A	why do people need for you to have some alcohol?
B	yeah it's like you said it says more about the other person I think
A	it does
B	it's like going you're really boring if you're sober so you need to drink er cos you're not interesting enough
A	yeah thanks mate
B	or it's saying erm I need you to drink to sort of erm
A	feel better about my drinking
B	yeah to sort of
A	yeah
B	what's the word? not validate it or you know say that it's okay
A	yeah
B	but if someone's not drinking I think there's some you know something quite erm
A	oh okay
B	there's even if you don't show this
A	yeah
B	will always think
A	there are some experiments could be done here
A	well we could try different reasons for not drinking
B	yes
A	and see
B	see which is more or less offensive
A	yeah what's more acceptable
B	I think saying dry January is very acceptable
A	yeah
B	cos people know it and it's a thing that people do
A	yeah and sober October
B	yeah
A	people do
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	so I wonder if I'm part of a twelve-step programme
B	yeah
A	whether people there people will immediately back off and not push the issue
B	yeah
A	won't spike your drink and will offer you lots of juice
B	help and support yeah
A	yeah
B	yes
A	so
B	well I started drinking wine at eight in the morning
B	I'm okay
A	yeah
B	but it all er you know things like oh for health or for weight
A	yeah
B	people don't like that
A	no not at all
B	erm for money people don't like that I tried to use the money on Friday and they were like but it's a party it's free
A	oh
B	I only drink if I don't have to pay for it
A	yeah
B	well what religion?
A	I I don't know
B	it it would have to be Muslim I guess
A	Muslim hey you would and that's
A	yeah try that in Poland
B	sorry
A	but as a Muslim woman
A	that's magnificent I think we should try that
B	I don't know
A	oh dear
B	I'd have to stop eating bacon I don't eat that much bacon anyway
A	yeah
A	what is all that noise going on there?
B	something's rattling oh it might be bits of ice cube or
A	yeah I was kind of hoping it was all the snow coming off the roof cos it's been on there for a month like
B	yeah cos I saw like ice flying off someone's car before
A	yeah let's hope icicles don't fly through somebody's windscreen
B	yeah
A	so whoops sorry
B	the Final Destination films that is a weird noise though isn't it?
A	yeah
A	I was just thinking you were just oh on the wavelength there
A	I was just thinking exactly that I mean again oh actually talking about boring or not boring or good or evil this is where I got the idea and it's I worked in a booze shop
B	yes
A	and people'd come in and go oh isn't it an awful day?
B	it's like the happiest day of someone's life
A	so what's pissed on your brain this morning?
B	someone's just got married they're having the best day
B	yes it is
A	it's a topic of conversation
B	it's a filler when you're not sure
A	yeah but then why do we choose something that's gonna bring something less than positive into the other person's energy stream you know?
B	yeah
A	why are we saying oh isn't it all really shit? oh isn't it great? oh this rain's horrible isn't it? or
B	but I also say it er when the weather's nice you know I don't always you know only choose to do it
A	you don't go oh isn't it hot?
B	no I always go I love blue skies blue sky's great er
A	oh okay
B	I'm not sort of
A	you're not weatherist
B	weatherist
A	weatherist
B	weatherist
B	I acknowledge all types of weather
A	well done
B	yeah
A	the full diversity the full spectrum
B	yeah
A	so she's been over for a week but
B	yeah
A	you've hardly met really that's amazing I suppose they stayed in
B	they were in
A	and they stayed in
B	they didn't stay
A	oh
B	but I didn't see them at all that
A	yeah after you've been to the gym and come home starving
B	yes
A	yeah
B	oh good for you
A	so we can have smoothies in the morning
B	smoothie time
A	yay
B	good for you
A	yeah it's quite handy coming in the van we would've been a bit stuffed had we got a bus
B	I know and also the duvet
A	I know the bus with a double duvet
A	yeah
B	yeah well I've brought a duvet a pillow and two blankets so that should be
A	me too
B	I think there'll be heating
A	yeah
B	from what she's said which I
A	oh yeah like a guest house type thing?
B	I think so but it's a part of a convent
A	ah
B	or it's run by nuns and either way it's nun related
A	okay
B	cos her auntie is a nun
A	nun related accommodation I like this okay
A	ah hence the chicken for lunch
B	hence the chicken
A	okay
B	erm so they provide food but they also have cooking facilities
A	okay
B	I don't know whether ordinarily you would be allowed to use them
A	well I asked
B	yeah
A	so erm
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	I've got curry for one and then I've got erm soup for four that we can have another time
B	oh good
A	so
B	sounds nice
A	yeah
B	yeah so
A	on no it's broccoli oh shit we're all gonna be sleeping in one room and farting oh god
A	we may not wake up anyway
B	erm yeah anyway what day is it? it's Monday
A	Monday yeah
B	so no medication since don't know
A	just before the party?
B	I didn't think I had it or did I?
A	I thought you told me you had a little snifter before the party so you could breathe and
B	maybe I was maybe I was thinking about it
B	but I don't think I did you know
A	no good for you
B	I don't think I did I've just been hammering this other prescribed thing
A	uhu
B	erm
A	is that the nasal flush thing?
B	no no no this is it's like a steroid thing from the doctors that I've had for a while
A	yeah
B	but it
A	okay
B	there is no sense of relief but it's you know more long term or long lasting or it's doing it sort of behind the scenes so it's not a quick release
A	yeah
B	er
A	so once it's taken a week or so to get in your system will you feel more relief?
B	hopefully yeah
A	yeah
B	er and with this flush thing
A	oh lovely
B	er and it's with it it takes all of the insides of your nose
A	okay
B	erm it really clears you out but what I've got isn't that but it's not bad
A	oh I forgot my earplugs okay
B	really erm struggling with sleep
A	are you?
B	erm yeah I was up at half four and I don't think I went back to sleep then cos my alarm went off at half seven I was just tossing and turning
A	there is a school of thought that suggests that humans only really need four to six hours in any one block
B	yeah but I you know I know my body and I know that I need eight hours
A	mm do you need it in one block?
B	yeah
A	oh okay
B	and that's for sort of optimum me during the week when I'm working it just drops to about seven
A	mm
B	and
A	my optimum where I feel fantastic is five or six you know from midnight
B	yeah
A	and then another hour or two from about five in the evening
B	yeah
A	and I feel fabulous on that but at the moment I don't have enough to do and to keep me amused and entertained within the day
B	yeah
A	to warrant so many waking hours so I'm indulging in sleep reality which from having fantastic dreams I've been really enjoying so
B	yeah
A	I'm not gonna change at the moment I imagine when I'm farming I will slip back into a four to six hours and then an hour or two in the evening
B	I can't nap I can't sleep during the day er
A	mm
B	it's torture
A	yeah
B	in many ways like my dad can fall asleep within three minutes like
A	wow
B	on the sofa when he gets home from work
A	yeah
B	I can't do that
A	I can
B	mm my mum's the same as me she just
A	mm
B	you know that's it
A	yeah
B	no
A	I became an accomplished napper when I first got my mortgage
B	uhu
A	which is probably about fifteen years ago now and couldn't afford it as nobody could with mortgages back in the day and so I worked seven days a week and sometimes fifteen hours a day
B	yeah
A	but there was a gap where I finished work at three in the afternoon and started again seven in the evening so I had to drive home which was about half an hour and then I'd have something to eat and then I would nap and then I'd get up and wash and then go to work in the evening till eleven or midnight or whatever and that nap between jobs was just so important
B	yeah
A	it really was crucial to not killing myself driving and getting enough
B	yeah
A	I don't regret it it just was as it was
B	yeah erm you know I don't think I will ever be that person I don't have that
A	mm
B	or to do more than is absolutely necessary
B	I think we've talked about this before
A	yeah
B	yeah but
A	yeah
B	and my mum does so much that she you know drives herself mad
A	mm
B	and makes herself quite unwell so
A	yeah it's not good
B	so I've sort of learnt from both of them I guess
A	I know I had to turn Simon down erm because he was playing some music but I suppose now we're on the motorway I could
B	no just
A	yeah well if we do we'll find a coffee shop
B	yeah
A	erm I don't think we'll be soon because once we get on the seven which is south
B	yeah yeah
A	yeah I'm presuming it's gonna have snow on it as well I'm amazed this road is clear
B	I think they come out they come out er early
A	wow really must do it's amazing
B	but it is warming up you know
A	yeah we're three point five degrees plus which is very
B	yeah we were
A	it's warmer here
A	I know
B	it's gonna be rammed
A	it really is I suppose it's gonna be full of school teachers
B	true yeah kids

A	so I was driving all over the country trying to find a Tesco that was open and had a toilet
B	uhu
A	erm ended up weeing in ditches a lot trying not to get my nice suits too dirty my shiny shoes too muddy
B	very odd
A	yeah then you move here and you've got these gorgeous motorways
B	yep
A	and er an abundance of services it's fantastic
B	I like service stations don't go enough
A	yeah
B	maybe once a year
A	mm
B	the best one is in the Scottish borders
A	I know it
B	is it the one with the fish pond outside?
A	yes
A	which was frozen when I was there and it's got

A	it's good
B	I think it is really
A	therapy
B	it is it's really er
A	yeah
B	I'm quite a sort of
A	my three week sore throat has disappeared since we've been talking
B	yeah? good
A	yeah and I
B	yes
A	yeah it's good
B	yeah I've been coughing a lot at night and I think it's because
A	yeah
A	is it a productive cough?
B	no well it's it's hopefully it'll stop now
A	yeah
A	stop the music I'm trying to sort that out
B	kind of nice
A	well I know it's it's erm
B	jeez
A	I know this is Polish overtaking
B	yeah
A	but that's not the culture here you pull out at the last minute and as soon as you've overtaken you're expected to pull in again
B	so
A	yeah I meant to send her a message this morning
B	yeah I
A	mm
B	what I wanted to say but I was just telling her about yesterday and she was
A	yeah she's a nice and supportive friend isn't she?
B	she is lovely friend
A	yeah
B	sometimes I find her difficult to talk to I think we're both quite maybe quite quiet I don't know
A	yeah I suppose
B	yeah she is
A	yeah
A	actually I find you really talkative as well
B	I find you really talkative
A	do you? oh my god
A	I would say that you are more talkative than me in our groups would you say that I'm more talkative than you in our groups?
B	yeah for sure
A	oh my god
B	oh what? in the in the Whatsapp groups? or in real life?
A	yeah
B	oh right
A	if we're together I mean on Whatsapp
B	yeah and I don't really use it
A	yeah
B	just read
A	yeah
B	erm
A	you're a lurker
B	I am a lurker yes
A	that's okay
B	er in real life yeah I think
B	you're more talkative than I am
A	as opposed to made up life
B	virtual yeah virtual reality
A	okay
B	erm yeah
A	yeah
A	mm
B	well I
A	well and had
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	mm
A	yeah
B	it's funny isn't it? how
A	yeah
B	and it's not it's not a sort of a negative thing a lot of the time it can be quite interesting when
B	I thought about that for about well I still think about it
A	oh my goodness
B	am I? am I though?
A	do I detect a little mirror
B	yeah and I thought goodness
B	I just don't think I'm either of those things
A	if I had to say does who does that apply to all the more? you or
A	I would say
A	I think he's seeing in you what is more apparent in himself
B	yeah
A	mm
B	er I mean I wasn't arguing I wasn't saying anything at all he we just sort of shouting at me
B	so he was arguing I sat and just sort of stared at the wall
A	yeah
B	out
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	then yeah you owe it yourself to look at that
B	mm
A	and turn it over in your mind running through your emotions
B	yeah
A	and if it doesn't resonate with you as truth then reject it
B	yeah
A	cos your truth is the only one that matters somebody else's is their subjective idea of you it's not real
B	true yes
B	bollocks to that
A	yeah
B	you know attention-seeking possibly but self-destructive I don't think so
A	no
B	yeah
A	but I would say he's attention-seeking
B	it's sort of the way that he acts and you know the way he presents himself to the world
A	mm
B	says I want people to notice me
A	yeah and to like me
B	yeah
A	well we all like to be liked but yeah
B	mm
A	yeah
A	oh
B	yeah
A	and I need to indicate that way yes erm so yeah it looks like you drive west to
B	yeah
A	and I am because we're on the seven and then you're on the seven till pretty much
B	I see
A	but you'll see what I mean
B	yeah
A	just cos you've got this much motorway and actually the motorway is surprisingly clear I wonder had we headed south and then west if we would have encountered a lot more snow bad weather

B	UAE
A	yeah

A	oh my god that's a really good question as far as I'm aware it's
B	cos I said to
A	a country
B	ah
A	but now you mention it that's put a question mark in my mind
B	cos I thought
A	no I'm sure they've got a football team
B	ah okay mm
B	it's you know near Dubai and the rest of them
A	yeah that part of the world really does not appeal to me
B	does it not?
A	no the whole sort of Jerusalem Bethlehem thing does and then
B	mm
A	sort of Georgia and around there the poorer nations do
B	yeah I'd like to Israel
A	but yeah I've been to Israel it's pretty cool but this whole affluence thing that's
B	yeah
A	I dunno it's just like how man fucks nature basically you know building this well building buildings in the middle of the desert
B	yeah
A	it just seems so artificial
B	yeah
A	and so abhorrent
B	erm
A	okay speed camera what was the speed limit?
B	seventy
A	speed of the car in front that's pointing the other way anyway erm
B	what was I gonna say? I know loads of people who live in Dubai loads of friends er teachers and er people who work for Emirates Airlines
A	mm
B	er and I know my cousin lives in
A	mm
B	and it just sounds the most ridiculous place er it's like you know you talk about culture shock but this is something else
A	yeah
B	erm and the amount of money and how expensive things are they were taking him like
A	what? jeez
A	okay it's not on the bucket list
B	er you know and I've taught kids from Saudi Arabia kids from Dubai kids from all of that area and the girls are great but the boys are just awful
A	arrogant arses?
B	they er they are ten years old and they think they own the world
A	oh god
B	because they've not been told otherwise
A	yeah not been taught manners
B	yeah er and someone I know
B	and
A	what?
B	er and he went well
A	fair enough
B	er so
A	wow
B	and then from there he learnt to dress himself
A	very good yeah no
B	mm
A	and your parents' economic affluence
B	yeah
A	and I find that also abhorrent
B	mm
A	it's not a culture I want to engage with on that level
B	no
A	oh jesus are you pulling out? you can stay there and you can pull out ah
B	ah
A	ah
A	stuck
B	absolutely stunning
A	woo this is one of my favourite bits when you come over this hill actually I'd forgotten about that actually

A	bugger all snow though hey?
B	it's all melted
A	yeah
B	oh good
A	not too much snow not too ice well yeah not too icy just perfect so looking forward to that
B	oh good good good
B	I thought it'd take hours and hours
A	no I've done this trip a few times visiting hippies and it erm I can get to
B	uhu
A	then I'm just up the mountain and round
B	yeah
A	yeah a little bit off the beaten track after that are you cold?
B	no I'm not
A	okay
B	I'm just just right
A	might just divert that onto the tootsies cos my
B	oh no
A	mm
A	good
B	had to put some
A	lovely
B	in my
A	oh that is disgusting I can't believe you're mixing all of that with millet millet to me is like erm
B	it's like mashed potato
A	yeah you can make millet mash if you
B	uhu
B	yeah it's really wet
B	could be anything
A	yeah
B	you know
A	fair enough
A	yeah
B	if you get into that wheaty territory
A	am I meant to be giving way to that? oh it's a person at a bus stop it's not a person at a pedestrian crossing
A	and I finished off my soya milk just cos I didn't wanna leave it in the fridge
B	yeah
A	I think that's the road you take to go to
B	uhu
A	yeah it is fifty-two erm
B	mm
A	so if I'm pregnant and it it's the immaculate conception you'll believe me won't you?
B	absolutely
A	I don't think the tabloid press
A	yeah
B	but no I'm expecting it to occur
A	I know I could
B	imminently
A	spontaneously combust any moment
B	imminently
A	mm yeah
B	yeah
A	ah no I think I'm a couple of days overdue
A	so what do we say here? looks like anticipated arrival time one thirty we've got another seventy-five kilometres so
B	okay
A	so I'll pull over there get some diesel and then we can get a nice cuppa in there if you fancy it?
B	yes please
A	yeah I need a wee

A	er usually comes a point in the spring where I start using it but
B	mm
A	winter I'm not
A	not usually in the van that much
A	mm
B	in litres a day
B	between three and four I think
A	that's perfect yeah
A	yeah
B	I think your body adapts
A	it does yeah
B	and the more you drink it expects that every day
A	yeah
B	whereas
A	I've noticed that
B	yeah
A	she drinks coffee but never water she never needs a wee
B	yeah
B	I know in some ways it's completely stupid cos I'm having loads of wees in the night but
A	yeah
B	it's a small price to pay
B	I was super bloated the other night I took a picture and sent it to my friend I could've been having a baby you know I was so bloated it looked outrageous
A	what did you eat
A	mm
B	with er mash potatoes and sweetcorn
A	proper mash?
