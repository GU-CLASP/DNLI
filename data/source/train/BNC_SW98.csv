B	so are you living still with the the housemate that you found back in October?
A	yes
A	er oh
B	you remember when you went to see it?
A	did I say that?
B	you remember when we saw those hovels?
A	yes
B	oh
A	two flatmates
B	but wasn't it er just living with one woman?
A	mm
B	or is that a different place?
A	mm
B	ah
A	which I probably should've taken
B	I was under the impression that you'd
A	oh
B	gone with that
A	the nice one
B	one you see
A	no
B	I thought it was all swish
A	no
B	so was it cheaper? This other place?
A	this place is cheaper but I've got I've been locked into a contract until the end of June
B	oh dear
A	probably I have to pay until June
B	how much is it?
A	three hundred no yeah including bills and internet and everything it's three hundred and ten per month
B	that's not too bad with bills and stuff
A	yeah
B	oh
A	so it's really close
B	perfect
A	yeah
A	do you you know where
B	yeah
A	it's it was there
B	uh-huh
A	um and that considering it was five hundred and fifty per month
B	oh right
A	um
B	okay
B	that was a lot more expensive
A	yeah
B	mm
A	which would've been better
B	what happens if you break your contract? Have you given them a deposit?
A	I don't know
B	I mean that's
A	I don't actually know
B	SE hmm
A	but that's quite hard
B	and how many months er rent do they have from you for
A	one month's
B	as a deposit?
A	deposit
B	mhm
A	so we've been days sometimes weeks without hot water and heating
B	oh no
A	yeah
B	yep
A	and they're still not replacing the boiler
B	why don't you just refuse to pay your rent until he sorts it out?
A	so we've that's what we've now said that we're gonna do
B	is it a private landlord? Or?
A	no it's
B	mm
A	and the agency won't hear of us not paying
B	yeah but I mean at the end of the day if they're not it could be a way of getting out of your contract
A	that's this so in January when it was really bad over Christmas
B	oh no
A	there was a week that there was cold water
B	it was so cold as well wasn't it
A	it was freezing
B	uh-huh
A	and only one of the girls in the house qualifies for legal aid being free because if you earn over a if you have a certain amount in savings you can't get free legal aid
B	oh okay
A	so it's all up to her
B	yeah
A	it has to be done properly
B	and have you  have you  got any er is there not a legal adviser in the university housing association?
A	no
B	Cos can you is there not?
A	no
B	mm
A	and they've just kind of gone well we can't do anything
A	um I
B	well they're obviously fixing trying to fix something that can't be fixed
A	basically
B	and in your contract does it say that the that they are responsible for upkeeping the I don't know what they'd call it the
A	there's a yeah the like
B	fixtures and fittings
A	yeah
B	and
A	I mean like it's one of those contracts which is like thirty statements long
B	well if there's no hot water
A	hot water
B	and no heating that's hardly habitable is it?
A	they keep saying to us oh summer's coming soon
B	well why don't you just try and get a lawyer to just get advice to say look they've broken the contract in that they haven't kept the house habitable um I want to write them a letter saying
A	Don't I have to pay for that?
B	in consideration
A	that's why we're trying to go through the legal aid thing
B	or just ask er ask the question
A	it's been intermittent since December
B	then that's you know that's not they're breaking the contract
A	I think we talked to the landlord recently
B	oh
[ANNOTATION]	the landlord wants to break the contract	Neutral
A	she started off really angry and then she sort of calmed down
A	come on woman
B	mm
A	which is kind of the idea
B	well that's the thing
A	yeah
B	this is
A	all of this
B	compromising my ability to concentrate
A	at home
B	twenty miles
[ANNOTATION]	there will be a court rule	Neutral
A	yeah
B	um
A	but
B	reason I would like to dissolve the contract based on the fact that you haven't respected
A	I er that's actually I think pretty much been said
B	can you not? SE What about the Citizens Advice Bureau?
A	that's yeah that's why we're going
B	oh okay
A	which takes time and I mean they're booking us an appointment and the girl has to go in and see them
B	yeah
A	and I can just go home whenever
B	hm
[ANNOTATION]	the house in not habitable	Entailment
A	yeah I know I I don't know what I think one of them goes to her boyfriend's and the other one probably goes to a friend's but
B	it's not typical
B	it's not er oh what's the word? It's not an ideal situation
A	yeah
B	there you go
B	not an ideal situation when you
A	I'm like what are you trying to say?
B	I don't know what I'm
A	no it's not an ideal situation
[ANNOTATION]	the situation well improve	Neutral
B	especially when you've got so much else to deal with
A	huh
[ANNOTATION]	there are other things to handle	Entailment
B	oh yeah? Where?
A	Japan
B	oh
A	um
B	mm
A	from there
B	mm
[ANNOTATION]	speaker A can focus on the matter at hand	Contradiction
A	but I really wanted to get some done before I left
B	yeah
A	do you know what I mean? Cos I'm trying to get them to move into this hell hole
B	yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	I mean
B	the slug palace
A	Morocco was interesting
B	how long did you go for?
A	four days
B	oh it was a quick quick trip
A	it was a very quick trip
A	woah prepositions um in London at midnight
B	oh no
A	and I was just like oh mate I'm gonna kill you
B	and how was the Morocco part of the journey? SE
A	I was kind of surprised
B	really? Where were you?
A	marrakesh
B	uh-huh
A	um
B	really?
A	in terms of
B	well it's better than what you've got at the moment
A	yeah I know
B	little republic of third world
A	yes
B	and did you see anything nice? Or buy anything nice?
A	oh my friend wanted to go
B	uh-huh
A	in the souqs and the markets
B	no
A	what?
B	I know
A	oh that sucks
B	we'd already got the tickets
A	huh
B	and everything
A	that's really bad
B	we were going to do we were going to I think arrive in Fes
A	yeah
B	and then travel down the east coast
A	oh
B	I find that that um like the kind of TE Maghrebins in France are just so rude
A	yeah
B	and there's like there's no barriers
A	yeah
B	and just not chat you up even
A	yeah
B	it's disgusting
A	yeah
B	it's weird though
A	it doesn't happen in Spain
A	I mean I got followed once or twice in Spain
B	are you sure his best mate wasn't trying to rob you from behind?
A	um
B	Pick pocket
A	probably
B	it was probably a diversion tactic
A	yeah it probably was
A	different ones
B	oh
A	I thought if they thought I was local they would treat me with a little bit more respect
A	Cos I don't wanna know what you're saying
B	so like lecherous things
A	just nasty
B	just say you can think it but just don't vocalize it
A	just don't even  don't even  look at me
B	oh no
A	and
B	I'm sorry
A	well it was an experience
B	no
A	yeah
B	crikey
A	and my mate was like why don't you just hit them? Or like shout at them? And I was like we're in a Muslim country
A	like the men it's all men
B	mm
A	no one's gonna save you
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	they're all gonna stick up for each other
B	oh well
A	yeah
B	you know
A	so I'm not going back there
A	but apart from that
B	and I saw that you said to
A	I have been to Thailand
B	ah
A	Thailand Cambodia and Vietnam
B	okay
A	I haven't been everywhere
B	you know people everywhere
A	I haven't been everywhere
A	I was like oh maybe one a year is my
A	aim at the moment
B	oh my friend's just been to Burma and it looks amazing
A	amazing
B	she had such a fantastic time
A	yeah
B	and do local things
A	things
B	as opposed to touristy stuff
A	how did she do that? Cos I always wonder
B	I think she's just got such a that
B	kind of personality
A	that's pretty awesome
B	takes risks in chatting with people
A	yeah yeah
B	and because she's so eager and she's very I dunno she's very um engaging
A	yes
B	I think she picks her  she picks her  victims well
A	charming
B	but yeah she was chatting she she travelled with a another girl who she met in a a backpacking place
A	yeah
B	en en route
A	yeah
B	to maybe
A	to sort of
B	chat with people
A	nice
B	had a few whispered political discussions and
A	blimey
B	went and stayed at er temples and stuff like that
A	my mum's one of those
A	I mean a long time ago they came to visit me in Japan
A	and every day they had some story of how
A	they'd had a tour in a police van
A	someone had driven them home
A	but you're just like working your way round the countryside
B	that's good
A	yeah
B	whenever my parents used to come to visit me I felt I just felt that they they abandoned all abilities to make any decisions at the airport
A	oh and
B	yes
A	oh
B	I mean I can
A	oh I just leave my parents to it
B	I can understand
A	is this in Spain?
B	yeah
A	yeah?
B	when I was in living in France as well
A	yeah
A	they come visit you and they're just like you're gonna look after me right? And I'm like um my language skills are just as bad as yours
A	Don't be deceived by the fact that I've been living here for three months
A	to go new place? Or to go? New I really wanna go to China
B	cool
A	I'm sort of hoping that it might happen
B	really?
A	yeah
B	mm
A	because I want to buy the ticket in Japan
B	mm
A	so I'm not sure if it's even possible
B	that's a shame
A	it is
B	er go to Taiwan instead
A	yeah
B	right
A	I dunno about Taiwan
B	I don't know
A	before?
[ANNOTATION]	they are not sure that can buy ticket in japan	Neutral
B	yeah
A	oh yeah
B	aha
A	it would be from May to June
B	how many weeks have you got to do your dissertation?
A	I've got from May to
[ANNOTATION]	how many weeks have to do dissertation	Neutral
B	mm
A	so I'm hoping that I'll be pretty much done by the end of July
B	mm
A	yeah
A	I just wanna get through this
B	mm
A	but here it's quite a small department
B	mm
A	like if you don't know what to do
[ANNOTATION]	person A ,just wana get thorough this	Entailment
B	what what are other your fellow students doing?
A	most people are not doing teaching related projects
B	oh okay
A	because there's actually only five applied linguistics people
B	mm
A	like how does this affect a classroom? Or I dunno
B	what kind of TEFL stuff did you cover?
[ANNOTATION]	they cover TEFL	Entailment
A	I did teacher training
B	oh yeah
A	um
B	and did they actually provide modules lectures and stuff on those subjects?
A	yes
B	oh right
A	but that's part of the TEFL course that I kind of
B	okay
A	transferred over to a little bit
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about football	Contradiction
B	mm
A	but the other stuff I've done is corpus linguistics
B	aha
A	discourse yeah
B	okay
A	and yeah kind of
B	have you had to cover like structural linguistics and stuff like that?
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about party	Contradiction
A	we had a choice
B	oh
A	we all did do a bit of functional grammar
B	urgh
A	urgh
A	because I would've failed the grammar
B	right
A	I think like cos we spent three lessons three ninety minute lessons analyzing one sentence
B	oh my Lord
A	so most of us were not really prepared to go in and do a full analysis by ourself
B	how long are papers?
A	four thousand words
B	huh
A	our dissertation's only twelve thousand
B	mm
A	it's not
B	especially
A	problem with TE wittering
B	especially for a research project
A	yeah
B	as well
A	we have one research paper this term
B	so how many have there been in total? Apart from the dissertation
A	not that many you know
A	I've done three already
B	still quite heavy going
A	it's
B	especially when you have to read so much
A	I know
B	before you
A	mm
B	I had to always force myself into starting to write things
A	because you were still reading and taking notes
B	mm
A	yeah
B	aw
A	so I'm just like it's not interesting
B	mm
A	like you have to be interested otherwise
B	yeah
A	well you don't have to be interested
B	and it what what do you think the masters level is like? Cos I was you know the course I was doing was er um at a masters level
A	mhm
B	er had written
A	yeah
B	um
A	but did they do well?
B	well they passed
A	they passed?
B	they passed a masters level assignment
A	I think passing well I don't know to be honest because I proofread
B	mm
A	and content wise she didn't have a clear understanding of what she was doing
B	right
A	so I did understand why
B	mm
A	but I think I mean you know I don't know many people that are getting firsts to be honest
B	well I got
A	it seems fairly
B	I got two distinctions
A	oo
B	and I was just absolutely floored cos it's
A	why? You've so much experience you're
B	because it just
A	bringing to the table
B	yeah but it just felt like it was the
A	mm
B	whereas I was thinking oo masters level research it's going to be really heavy and
A	yeah
B	it's gonna be statistical analysis
A	no I don't think it is that bad
B	and lots of different variables
A	common sense
B	Mickey Mouse
A	how many papers have you already submitted?
B	three
A	okay
B	no there is no dissertation
A	there's no dissertation?
B	Cos it's it's so practical based
A	and how long are the papers?
B	three thousand words
A	okay
B	which is a nightmare because it's so difficult
A	so keeping it short and concise
B	yeah
A	and
B	yeah
A	yep
B	it was difficult
A	mm
B	and then describe the research methods
A	that's a lot
B	and then TE analyse the research methods and TE analyse how if they worked
A	no
B	see I'm getting confused just telling you about it
A	well the I mean if it if you have to do that much it's literally what? A paragraph for each thing?
B	more or less
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	was more or less two sides
A	sides
B	and then the evaluation and of your findings and criticizing your research methods was about two sides
A	Mickey Mouse?
B	Mickey Mouse
B	but I guess you don't find that
A	I'm finding well I mean I don't I I didn't know at the beginning what a good level was
B	all As
A	and then after that I didn't do so well
B	mm
A	like it's er the the things last term cos it was all new
A	yeah
B	yeah yeah
A	in fact I might show you one of my papers in a bit
B	yeah
A	what do you think of this rubbish
A	oh
B	it sounds so difficult having to choose your dissertation topic with no hardly any support though
A	but I guess that's the way it is
B	so what's your driving instructor like?
A	I thought no more complaining
A	he's alright
B	why?
A	but apart from that
B	really chilled
A	mine has a lisp
A	which is not helpful
B	oh no
A	but I mean I like him
B	three
A	oh you're ever?
B	yeah in my life
A	oh okay
B	this is my third one
A	blimey
B	yeah
A	do you get worked up before the lessons?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	he told me that I was gonna be driving on the
A	already?
B	crikey
A	and it was alright?
B	yeah
A	oh yeah
B	and you know I've got problems with my neck?
A	yeah
B	well oh the day after I was like
A	ff
B	like today we're gonna do emergency stops
A	already?
B	no I can't do it
A	already?
B	mm
A	that's really quick
B	he pushes me quite quickly
A	okay
B	well I was thinking if you're getting er you're travelling over to your parents to have this
A	yeah
B	well why don't you just catch the number one bus
A	Don't they normally pick you up from most places though?
B	no
A	the thing is that I'm I've been driving around the test centre roads near my parents' house
B	I don't understand
A	um so um different test centres have different pass rates
B	ah
A	so I wanna stay in that area
B	ah
A	so I've had like sixteen lessons
B	oh
A	probably about ten lessons away from taking my test I'd say
B	ah
A	I haven't done many manoeuvres
B	gosh
A	I didn't do that until like my tenth lesson or so
B	what were you doing for your first three or four lessons?
A	driving driving driving
B	yeah
A	oh I'm only there now
B	oh okay
A	but it's taken a long time
B	and how much do you pay per lessons?
A	ninety-two quid for five lessons
B	so that's eighteen quid an hour
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	mm
B	oo
A	I've passed my theory
B	oh have you?
A	yeah
B	ah
A	but I'm taking a big long break now
B	mm
A	I'm gonna have to come back and sort of get back onto it
B	when how do you do the theory then? Do you just apply to do it?
A	you just apply online and pay online
B	uh-huh
A	near Argos
B	uh-huh
A	and you just go in and do it
B	really?
A	yeah
B	but did had you learnt a lot from the driving that you'd done?
A	no
B	oh okay
A	it depends on what you get
B	what kind of questions came up?
A	the usual
A	just for example if so you're watching a video and your car's travelling down a road and you're looking out for people stepping onto the road or something that might
B	mm
A	like someone who's walking along the pavement might suddenly step onto the road
B	okay
A	so I'm just like click click
A	click click
A	click click click click like
B	oh okay
A	so make sure you do it twice at least when you see the hazard
B	oh no
A	doing it once
B	didn't the theory test used to be just a few questions asked by the
A	you still have some questions asked by the
B	really?
A	yeah
B	okay
A	like you have to lift up the bonnet and say what's what
B	no
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	oh my life
A	nothing major
B	mm
A	I mean cos they say like on average you take as many lessons as your age
A	and I'm just like uh
B	I've never heard that one
A	God
A	I would say
B	yeah
A	I neither am I
B	yeah
A	so
B	how old are you?
A	twenty-eight
B	how many lessons have you had?
A	seventeen
B	oh well eleven more
A	I think I'll need a few more to be honest
A	doing it
B	yeah
A	wow
B	and it's always been such a huge thing er when I wake up I'm like oh my  oh my  gosh I was driving in my sleep
A	how quickly do you wanna do it?
B	um I've
A	not bothered
B	I'm er not rushed
A	yeah yeah
B	I'd prefer to live in a nice little city that's got good public transport
A	me too
B	but I just thought it would it's a good idea to
A	it's good to have it
B	take advantage of this time
A	yeah
B	also if there's any jobs that come up that require
A	that you need to drive
B	a driving licence
A	yeah
B	mm
A	and it's just such a shame when you're like okay we can't help anyone
B	yeah
A	and it would just be useful to to be able to hire a car sometimes to sort something out
B	yeah
A	and so
A	he seems to think he can do it in a month
A	and in Japan they don't let you practise on the road
B	right
A	they practise in a little grid area in the back of a test centre
B	actually do you know what? I think I'd prefer to do that for the first
A	for the first one or two
B	first few lessons
A	yeah
B	not I mean tut not bonnet and explain what's going on but what you have to do in order to change gear
A	without worrying about the road
B	oh there's someone following me
A	yes
A	instead of swearing when I'm driving I always just go eek eek
A	and he's just like stop it  stop it
B	and then I said oh excuse my French
B	there used to never
A	heard it all
B	be a sentence without a swear word
A	yeah
B	mm
A	and I don't wanna just drive it into a wall
B	uh-huh
A	so I mean I drove it fine
A	because like the clutch and everything is so different on a different car
B	really?
A	and it was I was just like couldn't
A	you're very safe and slow just like your mother
A	and my driving instructor got all defensive for me
B	aw
A	twelve in the middle like
B	aw
A	yeah
B	just shouted at you all the time
A	not all the time
A	yeah
B	I mean I'd just jump if he shouted at me
A	I cried once in the car
B	really?
A	after that
B	why? What happened?
A	he just was yelling
B	no
A	and then he was like pull over
B	oh no
A	and he sort of stopped a little bit after that
B	that's the whole thing about learner drivers
A	I know
B	like yeah
A	I know
[ANNOTATION]	It took speaker A four attempts to get their driver's license.	Neutral
B	mm
A	but it seems really hard to find someone good
B	well why don't you just have like a few lessons with my  with my  instructor? Cos honestly he's so he puts you at your ease
A	but it's just the whole
B	I can't believe I'm confident
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B would not recommend their driving instructor.	Contradiction
A	I don't I really don't wanna take my test somewhere else
B	but you won't wouldn't have to
A	but you have to have that driver's car
B	yes
A	and that instructor
B	but you could go back  you could go back  to your instructor
A	oh right
[ANNOTATION]	They cried in the car because he was yelling.	Entailment
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	it might be  it might be  a good thing just to have experience with someone else in the car
A	that's true actually
B	yeah
A	stuff like that
B	for eight pounds and stuff and I'm thinking mm do I want to go with a driving instructor who is working as part of a franchise and probably gets paid
A	yeah
B	ten P an hour?
A	yeah
B	is he gonna be happy in his job? No
A	that's true
[ANNOTATION]	The driving instructor gets paid a lot of money and is probably quite happy.	Contradiction
B	I'd prefer to go with the guy who's got his own business and he's relaxed and
A	yeah
B	really?
A	yeah
A	until they pass the damn thing
[ANNOTATION]	It is quite easy to find a good driving instructor.	Contradiction
B	you will pass your test
B	you will bring shame onto our driving school if you don't
A	it seems like that
B	gosh
A	yeah
B	and just out of interest how much extra did it cost your parents to put you on their?
A	three hundred
B	three hundred quid?
A	for a year
B	pff
A	for a brand new Fiesta
B	right
A	it's not that bad
B	yeah
A	it sounds a lot
B	really?
A	when I tell them
B	you see tut
A	that sounds like a huge amount of money though
B	that's like a bus pass for the whole year
A	yeah I know
B	yeah
A	like I had all these lessons and then I got I went in the car in the new car with my dad and the driving instructor last week and I was er literally shaking
B	mm
A	and my driving instructor was just like what's wrong with you?
A	you're not normally like this
B	aw
A	but they're not really my it was supposed to be for my mum the car
B	mm
A	so I'm just like well should've somebody should really drive this car like
B	did your dad choose it? Or did your mum choose it?
A	my dad chose it
B	why didn't he let your mum choose it? Cos surely
A	Cos he's a numpty
A	wonder how often that'll come up in a corpus search
B	he's a numpty
B	hm
A	that's fine
B	ah
A	that's not clever at all
B	oh no
A	I know
A	it's like hello I'm here
B	yeah
A	basically
B	all the time
A	but in a way it's good because I used to never be able to find them in a parking lot because they have a silver car and there's so many silver cars
A	and now it's just like there they are
A	like I can see them a mile away
B	what kind of car is it?
A	it's a Fiesta
B	mhm
A	so the dashboard comes really far down in front of you
A	it is basically
B	so what what can you command it to do by voice?
A	so it's all auto
A	er you can make it you can put it onto auto like cruise er through voice activation
B	no wonder  no wonder  the dashboard comes up to your face
A	I know
B	it's it needs a brain
A	it's like a rocket
B	and have you tried night driving?
A	um
B	is that a lot different from driving during the day?
A	it's not that bad actually
B	really?
A	um
B	Cos I don't know whether my eyes are sensitive to light but you know those um headlights
A	mm
B	that are really kind of like
A	bright
B	bright blue
A	oh
B	white? They they leave such a trace on my vision
A	mm
B	that er but but it doesn't seem to be so intense for other people
A	have you ever had it checked?
B	yeah
A	are there special things glasses you can wear for that?
B	yeah I'll just look really cool all the time
A	yeah
B	with my sunglasses and
A	with my shades in the night
A	that's proper Knight Rider
B	yeah
B	I dunno
B	I'd like to end up in a little city and be able to walk to work or catch a bus
A	you wanna stay in the UK?
B	if it's cold
A	so er
B	but
A	yeah
B	and a stable income
A	but when you say I want to end up does that mean that could be anywhere? You're open to ending up anywhere? Or are you
B	I'm open to ending up anywhere as long as there's a way of er supporting myself
A	stability
B	and financial independence
A	stable job
B	Cos that was the worst thing about Spain
A	how much you were gonna earn
B	going yeah well you never knew how much you were gonna get earn month to month
A	yeah
B	just because they wanted to save a bit of money
A	mm
B	and so that means no
B	healthcare
A	yeah
B	no
A	I understand
B	unemployment benefit in case you lose your job
A	that's what I was like in Japan
A	and um recently they contacted me and said Oh we've got full-time jobs and I worked for them for quite a long time hoping and praying that the day would come that they would say we have full-time jobs
B	yeah
A	and suddenly they came up with four full-time jobs
B	in Japan?
A	yes
B	yeah
A	but then I looked at the conditions and I was like nah
B	mm
A	and I had more flexibility
B	mm
A	flexible
B	being flexible
A	mm
B	but living with the restrictions of not knowing when you're gonna have holiday
A	yeah
B	if the fridge breaks down
A	yeah
B	oh
A	the
B	mm
A	it was even my boyfriend's job was not a hundred percent stable
B	yeah
A	I dunno
B	it would be great to be able to earn full earn part-time wages and be able to live off them
A	I think in Spain that's very hard
B	oh it's impossible
A	in Japan
B	is just horrendous
A	I used to make for one lesson er so I worked for a little I worked for British Council and I worked for a little college
B	mhm
A	and they would term employ you per term
B	okay
A	on them
B	yep
A	so they had a maximum of eight classes
B	and how much was your rent?
A	my rent between two thirty thousand each
B	uh-huh
A	it's about coming up to two thousand eight hundred a month
B	mhm
A	which is as much as most people make full-time
B	mm
A	sometimes
B	right
A	but a hundred thousand a month will quite happily clothe feed party whatever you wanna do
A	it's quite a decent amount of money
B	yeah
A	you need to go home or something breaks down then yeah it's a problem
B	mm
A	but yeah
B	but it just seems here even um the one of the newly qualified teachers at my er at the school I was in before December she was struggling on a teaching salary
A	what is the lowest? Eighteen?
B	twenty-two eight hundred?
A	I think the cost of living in the UK is extortionate
B	it has gone up so much
A	yeah
B	but it's the same in Spain
A	yeah
B	but here it's yeah the fuel bills supermarket bills
A	just things like council tax and stuff
B	mm
A	is so expensive
B	yeah
A	I dunno
B	really?
A	everything else is
A	I always feel like I spend a fortune here on food
B	you're supposed to eat it
A	yeah
B	filled
A	yeah
B	with fruit and vegetable for pff ten Euros
A	ten quid
B	that would last you more than a week
A	not here
B	well I can't believe it
A	it's really expensive
B	it is
A	if you wanna eat well it's really expensive
B	stupid
A	there are not many jobs that pay thirty
B	I know
A	I don't know if I even wanna live in this country to be honest
B	no
A	yeah
B	and there is an a possibility of doing that here so
A	here
B	but obviously cos you
A	you wanna stay in Europe?
B	um
A	would you ever look further afield?
B	I don't know
A	yeah
B	and knowing what tut knowing how much effort it takes
A	yeah
B	a new language and to a new way of doing things
A	just exhausted by the whole thing
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	it's comforting in a way being back in the country where you know I speak the language
A	everything
B	yeah
A	there is no limitation
B	exactly
A	yeah
B	but no I wouldn't um rule out living in another country
A	mm
B	putting down roots and and if you can't do that
A	yeah
B	to support yourself
B	I don't wanna earn too much money
A	just wanna be comfortable without worrying about money
B	definitely
A	yeah
B	person's salary
A	that's true
B	unless you're earning over thirty grand
A	I just think the housing crisis is disgusting here
B	yeah
A	like I mean pff it's so expensive
B	yeah
A	I was in
B	oh yeah
A	the the family that I the
B	mhm
A	and I was just curious
B	oh
A	and I'm like they're not they're nice
B	yeah
A	and it's far away
B	but it's
A	from the city centre
B	but it's also
A	I know
B	yeah
A	but that's just insanely expensive
B	it is  it is
A	A one bedroom flat for two hundred and seventy-five
B	crazy
A	is so
B	enormous
A	different
B	I mean they're looking at um two bedroomed house
A	oh okay
B	one hundred and seventy
A	there's a big difference then
B	really big difference
A	but I mean er we were looking at buying um before we rented we recently moved to a new flat in Tokyo
B	yeah
A	and that's not bad
B	especially when salaries sound to be better
A	yeah they are a bit better
B	so where why do you say that you don't know if you wanna live in Japan? Cos I
A	no I mean I like it
B	is that in light of what happened last year with the earthquake? And the nuclear?
A	it's a little bit about that
B	mm
A	um
B	mm
A	I want like I the thing that fills me with terror which is me getting way ahead of myself of course but I don't wanna have a child and be away from my mum
B	mm
A	and not only be away but be an ocean
A	a thirteen-hour plane ride away
B	exactly
A	it's really far
B	mhm
A	so I just  I just  want a support network as I get older
B	yeah
A	and as they get older
B	yep
A	yeah
B	especially with all the injuries I had
A	mm
B	all of a sudden you've you can't
A	yeah
B	rely on your body or something
A	yeah yeah
B	mhm
A	just to improve my spoken
B	yeah
A	because that is not something you can make up
B	yep
A	get to a point where you can sort of get by
B	yeah
A	so that's a huge thing is feeling like I live on a periphery of a society
B	yeah
A	it's temporary
B	it does leave you feeling slightly marginalized doesn't it
A	and yeah er I'm not the brightest when it comes to languages
A	especially Japanese
B	such a difficult language though
A	school's expensive too
B	oo ff
A	that's like three four
B	mm
A	but it was just so expensive
B	yeah
A	it's fun but it's exhausting
B	yeah
A	students
B	either
A	no
B	I hate
A	learning that on this degree
B	yeah
A	but actually studying
B	but actually
A	yeah
B	mhm
A	and it was just like I couldn't get them into my head
B	mm
A	and it was just you know it was really hard
A	like that would be not good
