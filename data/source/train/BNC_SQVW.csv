B	I don't know what we'd done
A	was it dripping a bit or something?
B	I don't know it's it's dripped before and it's got the side wet but whether we left the taps on a little bit or from that morning maybe we hadn't pulled the shower up
A	oh
B	like cos you know when you pull the
A	mm
B	lever well the thing up then it changes from a tap to the shower?
A	yeah
B	maybe we hadn't pulled that up enough when we had our showers in the morning
B	so it was dripping out of the taps
A	oh
B	after we were having a shower and it was leaking I don't know but anyway
C	yeah
B	it was soaking wasn't it?
C	the showerhead was on top of the taps and it was running down

A	the leak hadn't bothered you? chilling out on the sofa were you?
B	of course
A	ignoring the water dripping down the walls
B	yes
B	not phased
A	yeah you'll be able to
B	I'm sure you can but I reckon the
A	base coast undercoat that will cover it? cos otherwise when you paint it does come back through
B	I reckon
A	it must be
B	what you'll just need to paint the whole ceiling
B	of that lounge
A	oh probably once you start oh
C	it's only little
A	there's a job you didn't wanna do
B	I know
C	it's basically gonna take me the whole weekend to get the wallpaper off
B	yeah well yeah it's
A	oh are you gonna take all the wallpaper down?
B	well it's
A	off the wall?
B	it's come off
C	it's crumbled off
A	oh what a shame
C	yeah
B	mm
A	so you're now decorating the lounge
B	do that
A	which was
C	yeah
B	I know
A	was an
B	I'm really not good with
A	especially when you've got no money
B	I know
B	yeah
C	shh
B	oh well that'll be the next bank holiday probably
A	so are are you gonna write a letter to your company asking about a a payment plan on those exam fees or?
C	erm
A	or are you gonna speak to somebody or are you not gonna bother?
B	email him or
C	no I'll speak to him
B	cos you've got the email address of
A	are you gonna speak to them?
C	yeah
A	mm
C	and I'll mention it to the recruitment consultant who might then pass it on to
A	oh that's a good way to do it yes yes yeah cos I I I think they'd pick it up
C	yeah
A	I'm pretty sure they would you know
B	probably
A	I'd certainly try it cos it's a you know it's a lot of money for you
B	it is yeah
A	but it's not for them
C	no
A	and they're gonna get the benefit now
C	so they may do I mean they said the well the money that I've gotta pay back is for my exams and a couple of the courses that I went on
A	right
C	and they've always said they're gonna send me on those courses for the next exams anyway so they're gonna pay for them
A	oh
C	yeah
A	send you on
[ANNOTATION]	Person A didnt get that where they will send the stuff	Entailment
B	mm
A	those courses?
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	that won't be a problem will it?
A	oh well if that's the case I'd yeah yeah a good idea going through the recruitment consultants I'd forgotten that's
C	I'll just mention it to her and say that they're being a bit rubbish about me leaving
B	what are you gonna do first then?
A	yeah
B	are you gonna speak to
[ANNOTATION]	Person B asks that is he gonna do dance	Contradiction
[ANNOTATION]	Person B asks that is he gonna do speak at first or something else	Contradiction
C	I'll do both
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	do them both yeah
B	okay fair enough
C	and then come up with a plan after that
A	hopefully you'll be yeah I think you'll be successful
B	yeah yeah I
C	unless they take it out of my pay packet rather than making us pay it back cos then I'll have to pay tax on it
B	oh is that how it would work?
[ANNOTATION]	Person B is thinking that they pay it first and then pay it back is weird	Entailment
C	yeah
A	if they're taking it oh yeah
C	if they're taking it straight out of my pay packet
A	oh before tax?
C	yeah
A	mm
B	oh okay alright
A	yes cos otherwise if it's er from you paying it back it'll you're right you'll have to pay tax it
[ANNOTATION]	Person A said it is your right to paying the tax	Entailment
C	I've lost about a grand in tax if I er
B	mm yeah yeah I suppose
C	for nothing
A	I reckon
B	yeah
A	I
B	well you'd think
[ANNOTATION]	Person B think that Person A think tax is something that we shouldnt pay	Entailment
A	they're being difficult aren't they?
B	oh they're just being horrible
B	if we weren't in the position that we're in I'd be a bit more like oh well
B	you know you did sign a contract to say that
A	it might
[ANNOTATION]	Person A think it might because of the contract that he signed before	Entailment
B	yeah so
A	oh they've got themselves covered and they're lawyers aren't they? so they're
B	oh of course they are yeah yeah yeah
A	they're not they're not gonna not have it covered
B	no absolutely and
B	you always said that didn't you? if I er do leave halfway through I
A	yeah
B	I am gonna have to pay back for my exams
A	cos I had said to you I'll see if you if they take it out the pay packet if you can pay it back see if they're entitled to take it
B	yeah yeah
A	but like you say if they're doing it
A	before tax
C	mm
B	mm
A	and like we said they're lawyers they'll have they'll have had it covered
B	oh of course
B	yeah
A	they won't have er mis-sell another contract
B	but erm
C	no well in a bit of a bad situation cos you can't do the exams you can't go on a course they make you go on the courses
B	yeah
C	and then say no you've gotta sign an agreement that you'll pay the money back
A	right
C	and you can't choose not to go on the courses cos
A	right
B	mm mm
A	mm so you're you're caught really
C	yeah
B	the courses were a bit of a waste of time as well weren't they?
C	well you know it was for the exams
B	well by a lot of the er the stuff that you said you could have just had a print-off and then come home and
A	yeah
B	done it yourself mm
A	well they only just read through the notes on the course
B	well exactly yeah
A	well make sure you at least take all the holiday there that's owing as well
C	yeah I've got five like only five days I've only took five so far
A	mm
C	and we'll be halfway through the year supposed to have twenty-five days in the year
B	well go back to them on that as well
C	mm
A	yeah
B	and say there's more
C	should have nearly seven and a half
B	should have nearly seven and a half
A	mm
B	oh they're just being really really difficult about it
A	so are you gonna erm do you want to come out to Bulgaria is that the plan?
B	I think so yeah definitely
A	mm
B	with those flights that are
A	you'd go down to was it the early morning Wizz?
B	yeah it was the yeah twenty past five but
A	yeah
C	need someone to pick us up
B	uhu
A	how would you get down there then?
C	dad?
A	oh would he take you down?
C	yeah
A	that's good
C	that's er
B	yeah
A	cos we're going
C	he'd be off work won't he? so
B	uhu
C	it's mid-week
B	yeah
C	mm
A	it'd be it'll be good and then he'd have the car seat
C	so he'd have to pick us up
A	yeah and then were the ones from East Midlands
C	about a hundred more
B	I think they were about a hundred pounds more weren't they?
A	in total or each?
C	each each
B	each mm
A	a hundred quid each
C	about two hundred return each
A	yeah
B	whereas the Wizz ones were a hundred each so definitely do that with er
C	mm
A	and we'd get in similar time because ours leaves about five twenty or does it? or five? yours leaves at five twenty?
B	ours leaves at five twenty if we book those ones yeah
A	ours would leave at five so that so we'd all be at the other ends
B	uhu yeah
C	yeah
A	we'd have to hire get a car
B	uhu
A	a people carrier
B	yeah
A	and get a car seat
B	yeah
A	and I'm wondering
B	yeah
A	on the first day the supermarket
B	yeah on the way uhu
A	and erm well we don't even have to go on the way it's up to us cos it depends on
B	okay yeah
A	how how
B	yeah of course yeah
B	mm
A	cos it's a really early morning so if he's grizzly
B	yeah
A	erm
B	well it would probably be better
A	but we can make erm
B	cos he would probably just sleep
A	yeah we can go on the way erm but we'd probably do er like a big food shop as well for the week and we could
B	yeah
A	buy the cot
B	uhu
A	we could buy a travel cot
B	yeah
A	I'm thinking
B	uhu
A	cos otherwise erm I mean I could ask
B	yeah
A	I'm a bit kind of I dunno if somebody had said to me straightaway oh can we borrow?
B	yeah yeah
A	when it's you've bought it for your baby
B	yeah I suppose
A	I'm sure they would
B	yeah of course they would
A	I didn't
B	well I mean they've even said to you haven't they? but
A	have they?
B	did er didn't you said that they said oh we've got all the stuff out there if you ever need it
A	oh I think it think it was more me saying oh I it'll be
B	oh oh I see
A	when you've finished with it I think even before you'd got pregnant
B	mm
A	erm the first time
B	oh okay
A	and I said said we'll we'll be buying all this off you or something when
B	mm
A	you've finished with it
A	but obviously yes it's all erm and but I dunno but if if we couldn't get one
B	yeah
A	I could contact them and see if we
B	yeah it'll be fine
A	or the other option is you have the double bed and he has to lie in the middle of you for the first night
B	yeah
A	you know or something like that until we get it sorted
B	oh I think he'll be fine
C	but we'll have all day won't we?
A	but we'll have all day cos we're getting there early that's right
C	yeah
A	so we only really need the one supermarket trip there
B	yeah
A	erm we're only taking a suitcase one way we're not bringing
B	right
A	cos you have to pay for the case
B	yeah yeah of course well we'll obviously need
A	yes
C	well hopefully one of them will take bags for us
A	cos er
B	yeah
B	I think with a baby you can have your changing rug's extra but er we'd have to check on Wizz we'd check
A	well I'm taking our I've got two cushions for the patio chairs

A	that I couldn't get out last year cos they were too big and I want to go to
B	yeah
A	a double duvet am I gonna get all this in one case?
A	well if it if it's already if it's in the packaging you don't take it out the packaging it's
B	well it's probably gonna be a lower tog as well isn't it?
A	and oh yeah and only like an eight tog well the lowest one I can get
B	yeah okay
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A will get the duvet with the highest tog measure.	Contradiction
A	and I want to buy

A	what do you mean
B	yeah
A	I'm not buying the duvets I'm buying just duvet covers

B	it's so really strange
A	that's a new bed as well I mean that mattress isn't very old
[ANNOTATION]	all the mattress are very old	Contradiction
B	oh no I think it'll be alright now I've
C	mm
B	as I say I've got it all off again I've watched washed the mattress cover the mattress protector as well this time
A	right
B	so I don't normally do that bit so it never gets dirty
C	I thought it might have been that we dried the sheets outside in the garden
B	do you think?
C	yeah
B	mm
C	there are lots of little midges round ours
A	this but oh it could have been
B	maybe bring them in
C	got some stuck in there
A	are you doing them in the dryer this time?
B	yeah I'll do them in the dryer
A	mm
B	so yes anyway bites yes so if babies get bites and what to
A	but hopefully you know he won't
B	can you use the plug-ins with him?
A	oh can you not?
B	I don't know whether they're really baby-safe I dunno
A	I don't even think they're well I
B	no
A	I don't know
B	oh
A	well I don't know well it's up to you then but hopefully that time of year it's not as bad as going in the
B	no it's not as bad as the summer
A	no
B	it'll be be alright
A	well you'll have to sort a passport out cos we're only talking
B	yes I know
A	a couple of months now
B	oh okay
A	he's gotta have a photo hasn't he?
A	you've gotta get him
B	three yeah three months it's gonna take us about that time oh for a child's passport now we need erm all of the grandparents' information we need everything it's ridiculous you need marriage certificates and all sorts it's
A	is this because people are abducting kids do you think? are they clamping you know you know?
B	I don't know but
A	when kids get taken from half the family
B	when someone at our yoga group was applying for one the other day when we went
A	yeah
B	on that meet-up they were filling out
A	oh really?
B	it was
A	crikey
B	ridiculous stupid
A	of course I suppose it's the first time you get one isn't it?
B	well
A	cos when you renew them you have to send your old passport off so they've got
B	yeah yeah
A	new pictures they've got your details they they know everything anyway but I suppose getting one for the first time
B	yeah
A	how much is it? it's gonna be a hundred odd quid isn't it?
B	yeah that as well
C	crazy money
B	yeah get a passport for your child or baby's first UK passport what you need to know
C	how long does it last?
A	sorry?
C	five years?
B	I don't know I think it's
B	yeah
A	I think only five with babies yeah
B	applying for your baby's first passport is a straightforward process
C	he's still gonna look very different at the end of that in five years'
B	oh yeah he will yeah yeah who can apply
A	well
A	it was when we went to Bansko looks so er so little
B	in the photograph
A	oh so you've gotta go and sit in the booth and
B	babies must not be holding toys or using dummies
C	thanks for that
B	children under one year old do not need to have their eyes open if their head is supported by a hand the hand must not be visible in the photo oh that'll be fine
A	right
B	tips for babies lay your baby down on a white sheet position or digital camera direct above the baby
A	oh you can take it yourself?
C	yeah
A	oh mind you if you
C	yeah maybe you'll be able to buy someone at you know passport size photos
A	yeah cos
B	mm
A	if you go into Boots or something can you have the option to have a little?
C	I think so
A	oh that'll be so much easier then won't it?
C	you'll have to sit him on that stool
A	yes
B	could take a Bumbo sit him in that
B	that
A	neutral expression
B	when applying for any first-time passport you will need to include the child's full birth certificate
A	the original or can you take copies?
A	does not accept copies documents must provided must be originals we've got two birth certificates anyway
A	yeah but even so you wanna send it all recorded post
B	oh yeah yeah
A	so that you know where it is and track it
B	please note if you are just renewing your child's passport a birth certificate is only required if the passport has been lost or stolen parents are only required to provide additional documents if
C	didn't used to
B	no you could just be
C	no you'd
B	included on yours
C	parents
B	couldn't I?
A	oh yeah
A	that's right yeah there were no pictures of
B	no no
A	of you
B	cos I might have changed
A	I can still I can't
B	mm
A	your first one probably because you're older not because they'd changed the rules
B	mm
A	I can't remember when that was
B	uhu
A	you were just named I think on mine
B	oh it costs forty-six pounds to get a child passport online or via post
A	oh maybe that's just cos it's a five year one and it's not
C	forty-six
B	mm
C	that's not too bad then
A	no mm
B	that's alright I think
A	we should take things like erm well you'll have blankets and a sheet for the cot you don't wanna be buying stuff like that do you?
B	no no we'll take those
A	take take those out
B	that won't take up much room
A	erm
B	could well could you get nice washing powder out there like or are we gonna have to take some of that with us? like non-bio stuff?
A	you can buy it all in
B	you can buy like non-bio stuff?
A	yeah I'm well I'm I've not looked for non-bio but
B	mm there you go well
B	you can take a little bit yeah
A	in the tabs? can you get the little do you ever put the little I use out there those
B	no but we'd have a look for them yeah
A	if there're if we can get some of those here that non-bio
B	cos it's easier
A	cos they're
B	mm
A	but I reckon you I reckon mind you it might be in Bulgaria and they might not know
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	by then
A	and he'll still be having his formula milk so you'll be able to take the formula milk
B	would you take the powder and then do what though?
B	would you just boil the tap water or boiled cos some bottled water they can't have isn't it it's too
A	can't they can't have bottled water?
B	there's some bottled water that they can't have
A	well do a bit of research on it
B	mm
A	I wouldn't
C	have to buy a filter get a Brita filter
A	like a Brita filter
C	traveller a travel filter
B	okay yeah I suppose we could
C	and then either put the bottled water through it or
B	yeah
C	tap water through
B	do you remember when
C	yeah
B	oh it was so funny
A	why?
B	well bearing in mind we'd just well we'd just got out there and we were the first ones out there do you remember we were
A	yes
C	and
B	erm
C	the water was orange through through the tap
A	oh and it had come up from
B	and the water yeah I turned it on and put my hands under it to wash and it come out and I was like oh no and my ring had turned a funny a
A	we don't tend to get that any more
B	no no no
A	sorted that yeah
B	but then
B	look at the colour it's turned my metal ring and he was like oh it's alright I was like oh for goodness' sake
A	oh yeah
B	yeah that was that was funny
A	yeah it's just if it it'll make his tummy funny you might get odd nappies that's all or things like that if he's not used to it
B	yeah yeah
A	but it shouldn't make him sick but
B	no exactly
A	oh
B	don't know
C	go to the market
B	sorry?
A	shh
C	go to the market and get some veg
A	yeah well
B	yeah supermarket
A	but you they don't I mean you've got potatoes yeah we can we can do all that can't we? we can
B	yeah
A	cos that's nice and soft and we can cook
B	yeah
A	and I'm thinking if if you find anything here
B	yeah
A	like sauces in packets
B	yeah
A	that he likes that we could put on pasta
B	uhu take those
A	erm we won't have blenders mind you he won't need it we can mash things
B	yeah yeah
A	by using a fork
B	yes it's only you know a week it's gonna be easier to plan what he's gonna have and
C	and just take
A	even if you buy
C	seven of the bottles
B	take what?
C	seven of the big Aptamil bottles or
A	well you
B	yeah you could do that
C	rather than worrying about it
B	you just don't want it to leak in the case
A	that's probably a good idea actually
C	rather than worrying about the water
B	yeah
A	yeah I think I'd do that's a good idea
B	yeah
A	and I mean even if he's on some packets and jars that he has here
B	yeah is he awake? yeah he's awake oh he's only had an hour
A	that's you
B	it's your fault
A	making a noise howling
B	beast
A	mm you're not in the room with the cooking are you? and it's upsetting you
B	upsetting her immensely
A	mm
B	undercover?
C	undercover
A	undercover yeah
C	yeah
A	yeah
A	is is is he I I'm not sure what it's about but I thought Onslow he was a policeman who was investigating her and ended up marrying her cos you have things like that on that happen
B	mm
A	don't they with police getting and and the wife never knows that all the time they've been investigated and he's ended up marrying them and having a family with them and it's based on something like that I think it might be something like that did you catch up
A	on The A Word? did you watch that?
B	no I said that I wanted to
C	it's still on Iplayer
A	for another yeah cos it's on tomorrow yeah you'll enjoy that one

B	oh
B	why has he gone there this morning? what's what's been going on?
A	oh she wanted him to look at erm the Attendance Allowance for her
B	again?
B	mm
A	but I think they haven't got it because erm she she doesn't fill the forms out properly
B	no yeah no probably
A	you're supposed to say you know how much difficulty he's in and
B	yeah
A	has he gone back to sleep?
B	no he's just lying there
A	oh
B	wide awake
A	you're supposed to say all that
B	yeah
A	and she she doesn't she just says oh no he can cope with this and he can do that and if he's on his own yes he would well I'm not putting down that he can't do anything I'm not putting that down
B	yeah
A	so if she won't fill the form out
B	no then
