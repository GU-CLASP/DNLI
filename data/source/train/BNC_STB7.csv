B	but they do
A	it's like it's like erm
B	yeah
A	he just laughs all the time
C	yeah isn't it nice

C	yeah well
A	oh right
C	she had a little rice bit of rice and she she can use a spoon so it's the first time she
A	mm mm mm
C	they're making her doing it anyway
A	that is quite amazing how kids can get food into their mouth on a spoon
C	first time she did it
B	yeah
C	and er
A	mm
C	her she came back on didn't they because she she can play the drums
A	oh what?
C	she has these two sticks and she's got erm
A	mm
C	well it's just a beautiful sound you know it is like
B	it's it's like a a a a West Indian er er bin drum you know
A	oh yeah a steel drum
B	yeah the steel drums but it's not it's a round kettle type
C	yeah
A	mm
B	with all these different bits on it so
A	so it is a steel drum then really
C	she she was sitting on the floor and just tapping the
A	mm
C	yeah she was doing ever so well
A	it's funny how quick they
B	chocolate?
C	yeah
A	how quickly they er
A	how quickly kids can do things
B	yeah
A	I mean it's like when you have an well have kids around at that age for a while
B	mm
B	they're brilliant
A	you only have to show them once and
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	mm
B	it erm there was there was a programme on about kids wasn't there
C	mm
B	and they learn more between the age of naught to five than any other time of life
A	mm
C	yeah
B	and you think what they do
A	mm yeah I mean there's so much to know isn't there
B	yeah but they have to learn to crawl they have to learn to walk they have to learn to talk they have to learn to listen they have you know
A	mm
B	there's loads of stuff
A	well in that age kids can learn two languages can't they
B	yeah
A	between naught and five
B	yeah
A	if the parents teach them two languages that they
B	mm that's right
A	that they've learnt from the very start
C	yeah well
A	mm
B	who only talks Mandarin
C	so it's a one-to-one all the time you know
A	mm
C	now
B	and she only talk Mandarin
C	yeah mm so she's likely to be to know both
B	yeah
A	you think what a fantastic advantage that is
C	mm
B	well it is isn't it especially Chinese
A	because the thing is that she'll learn the
B	as well yeah
A	rather than
C	mm and she's a lovely girl cos we we've seen her on Skype
A	mm
C	she's really well she's you know
B	she waved to us didn't she
C	she looks very much like
A	mm
C	and she's just
B	very expensive though
A	bet it isn't as expensive as London
B	probably not no
C	but then it's just one to one isn't it so
B	mm
A	mm
C	mm
A	apart from that it's putting your money back into the Chinese economy isn't it
B	yeah yeah
C	yeah
A	it's a good thing you know if someone well it was like people complained about Polish workers or something coming over here sending all the money back to Poland and stuff like this or Bangladeshis you know
B	yeah
A	money going straight out the country again well if they spend it in this country
B	yeah
A	you know you can't you know
B	that's right
A	no argument is there
B	there's no argument at all no
A	or even a good proportion of it
A	that's right yeah exactly
B	there's rent as well yeah
C	yeah
B	just from them two let let alone
C	yes they do
B	you wouldn't have thought
A	mm well it's a lot of these things you see these universities make an awful lot of money from Chinese students coming to this country
B	coming to this country yes that's true
A	then there's this whole thing you know you promote yourself in a country
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	and you get like first pick or first choice
B	yeah that's true
B	that is yeah
A	as far as I know
B	yeah
A	yeah it's interesting
C	they're loving it
B	yeah they love it
A	well it's funny when they first went to
B	that's right they were a bit worried about it
B	of it yes that's right
B	now yeah but they they work out of that place out of it
A	oh right
B	and that's er a little bit of
A	mm
B	but not that much but that is a lot better
A	mm
B	but well I mean you're talking about
A	mm
B	and that must that must have well that must be good for their economy to be like that
A	mm
B	because they've had to build that stuff
A	well it's like all these erm port towns you know like
B	yeah
A	whatever the other one is the massive one
B	yeah
A	yeah in the past twenty years they've exploded haven't they
B	they have yeah
A	well you see that was the other thing we were talking about is like how countries given the proper impetus can really develop
B	that's right yeah
A	you
B	yeah
A	I mean they're major cities in and in Thailand and all this sort of stuff
B	yeah
A	I see massive development going on
B	yeah yeah
A	it is
B	that's a big big surprise
A	well it's got the biggest population of any country hasn't it India has
B	mm
A	they overtook China recently
B	yeah
A	and er yeah when you think that their economy is everything from you know mud hut rural economy
B	that's right
A	you know people you know sort of dying of starvation and no water no toilets no nothing no electric and then you get other bits of the economy where they're sending you know orbiters around Mars
B	that's right
A	and stuff like that
B	why did they do that though? I mean it seems such a waste
A	well they reckon there's a lot of money and that's a well they did it you know where they say
B	to say we can
A	well no I mean America sent an orbit around Mars
B	yeah
A	which well went around there about a week after the Indian one did
B	yeah
A	and it cost America two hundred and fifty billion dollars
B	yeah
A	and India did it for forty-three million or something like that that's all it cost them
B	yeah
A	you know and there's there's a hell of a lot of money to be made in space exploration activity there is
B	yeah
A	and I mean you look at yeah when the first Telstar went round everything
B	yeah
A	yeah it cost a fortune what what's the point of that you know
B	and all it went was
A	yeah and now you look GPS
B	well yeah
A	yeah internet internet
B	that's right
A	telephone satellites
C	mm
A	you know that is just making the economy explode
B	that is that is
A	you know I was saying about the erm Alibaba thing
B	yeah
A	well they reckon that in places like China and in Africa they've completely cut out you know fixed-line telephones and stuff like that
B	that's yeah I
B	yeah and computers as well
A	that's right yeah computers they they're all connected up with er
B	they can sit in
C	mm
B	with computers
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	that's right and and
C	they've got their own tablet
B	yeah
A	and it's all done on erm solar power as well
B	yeah
C	mm
A	you know solar recharger and stuff
B	that's right yeah
A	and you know this all comes from things like Telstar programme
B	it did it had to didn't it yeah yeah
A	you know because if you didn't have the satellites none of this would happen
B	no
A	and they'd still be
B	wasn't that the Russians that sent the first one up though the Sputnik weren't it?
A	yeah Sputnik was the first one wasn't it
B	yeah and then
A	I think Telstar was the first radio wasn't it?
B	yeah that's right because they made a record didn't they called Telstar?
A	mm
B	oh dear
A	The Tornadoes
B	The Tornadoes yes that's right
A	number one
C	mm
A	wouldn't be surprised if we didn't buy it actually
B	might have done yeah
A	seem to remember it was very popular wasn't it
B	yeah weren't weren't that er that the first electronic music though?
A	erm dunno it might
B	was it Telstar the first electronic music?
A	might have been along that way
B	yeah
A	probably the first electronic number one
B	yeah probably
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	well it's strange isn't it when you think it's sort of like steps in
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Telstar is the seventh electronic music	Contradiction
A	human invention
B	yeah
A	you know things what really changed the world and you know like I mean radio erm not radio telephones did to a certain extent
B	that's right yeah
B	yeah yeah
C	mm
B	my aunt I mean she's dead now she was ninety-three when she died so she was born in eighteen hundreds nine nineteen hundred no eighteen hundred and seventy-five I think seventy-five or something like she was born
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	many things has changed throughout the time, including telephones.	Entailment
B	and she said that she was living through the the world of invention
A	mm
B	and discovery and never has anybody anyone ever
A	the aeroplane yeah
B	and now I've seen the rockets how many more people can do that?
C	mm
B	well you know when you think about what they saw and what we see
A	well that's right but they were all sort of very physical things aren't they
B	yeah yeah
A	like the invention of the internet
[ANNOTATION]	the aunt the B is talking about is alive and witnessed when the internet was first invented	Contradiction
B	oh yeah
A	is sort of fairly ethereal but that affects so many more things
B	that does
A	nowadays than you could possibly imagine even in even in ways that you don't think is in it's affecting you but it does
B	it does it's
C	mm
B	it's affected everything hasn't it
A	mm I mean it's a bloody wonderful thing really
B	that is
A	but I mean even like the the useful things like being able to buy stuff
[ANNOTATION]	the internet is boring and has not been as useful as it should be	Contradiction
B	yeah
A	without having to you know write a letter to some factory in Birmingham which is the only supplier of this sort of particular
C	yeah
B	twenty-eight days later you
A	yeah and all this sort of stuff you know and and er you know and and anything you need really anything at all you can buy on the internet can't you
B	yeah of course you can yeah yeah
[ANNOTATION]	nowadays, anyone can buy anything and anywhere just by using the internet	Entailment
C	yeah
A	you know any sort of gizmo for anything you know
B	anything
A	erm if anything breaks down you can get it on the internet
B	yeah and anything you want to know
A	yeah that too
B	you can you can learn it on the internet
A	that that's like
B	anything
[ANNOTATION]	Shopping technological stuff from the internet can be tricky.	Neutral
A	yeah
B	anything you want
A	well you see but the other things is though it's like affecting politics and stuff like that as well
B	yeah that must be yeah
A	you know because there's like you can't hide anything nowadays
B	no you can't
A	governments can't hide anything
C	no
B	no
[ANNOTATION]	Companies can hide easily their inside information.	Neutral
A	because there's someone out there who'll be
C	mm
A	even you know especially since smartphones
B	mm
A	there's someone now just instantly stick it
B	on on Facebook or whatever
A	yeah on Twitter or something like that
B	on social media
A	and people get to know about it you know
B	they do yeah
A	there's absolutely no cover ups any more
B	no there isn't there can't be
A	and er this goes together with the sort of propaganda stuff as well doesn't it
B	yeah yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Technology relates to propaganda at some point.	Entailment
A	but people can bring out propaganda
C	yeah
A	and that that goes everywhere instantly
B	instantly yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Propagandistic opinions are not easy to be confronted.	Neutral
A	whether it's true or not
B	yeah yeah yeah that that that is one
C	but then you can come back on it again can't you and say no you're wrong
B	that's another thing they can do isn't it I mean
A	yeah
B	you said this in nineteen fifty-three and we have proof you know cos all these recordings that
A	yeah that's right but it's the same like when the trouble is there's so much rubbish on the internet as well
B	well of course there is
[ANNOTATION]	Sound recording started in 1800.	Neutral
A	cos you know you get every
B	you just have a
A	Tom Dick and Harry giving their opinion on something
B	yeah yeah
A	and so you have to really
B	oh yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Some people express their point of view.	Entailment
A	it's quite powerful
B	that is quite powerful
A	I mean like you were saying you know there were these people donating a million quid to the dogs' home
B	yeah just like that yeah
C	yeah
A	just cos they're you know like it's not like someone donating a million quid there's hundreds of thousands of people donating a fiver or a quid even or even
B	yeah
C	mm
B	that's that's really strange because you know when we were kids all we had was the newspapers
A	that's right
B	to know what had happened but mostly you only knew what had happened in your local area didn't you
A	mm
B	I mean the the news the newspapers came out with some murder victim or whatever
A	mm
B	and but in your local area was it was real big news if someone nicked something from the Co-op or something like that
A	that's right
B	and that would be plastered across the headlines you know and I know I know a lady who took a a quarter of a pound of ninety-nine tea from the shop and she got nine months in Holloway
A	oh really?
B	nine months in Holloway
A	bloody hell
B	and everybody in our village cos
A	mm
B	now it's now it's a suburb of
A	mm
B	and er she got done
A	and was there a protest?
B	huh?
A	was there a protest?
B	well there weren't they just said oh dear oh dear oh dear I mean she was ridiculed more or less
A	well in those days you got nine months you were in for nine months weren't you
B	yeah
A	and nowadays you get nine months you're out in two
B	you're out in two yeah
C	the suspended sentences
B	it will cost about eight hundred quid a month er a week to keep a prisoner in there
A	mm
C	yeah
B	what they should have is use up all the all the ex-rigs that don't work any more
A	no
B	they've still them out there
A	yes
C	he's hard
A	what they should do is like inside the prison have these great big poison areas with incinerators you know when people go to prison just like do away with them and then shut the door and forget about them
B	oh crikey
A	and no one would know
B	this is Hitler talking
A	yeah but they I mean even
C	just give them porridge every day
A	even now they send far too many people to prison
B	course they do for no reason at all half of them
A	yeah for just like really silly little things
B	yeah
A	you know and sort of things that yeah okay they did wrong but that isn't you know any alarming nothing alarming
B	no
A	to worry about too much
B	well my dad made headlines I probably told you about this we made a U-turn in the middle of the road to go and fetch his hat
C	made headlines
A	oh he's on a motorbike?
B	yeah and his hat blew off and he made a U-turn in the road to go and fetch it and he got done I forget how much he got done know it was sixteen pounds or something silly like that and this is er just after the war
A	and he made headlines?
B	and it was headlines in the
A	oh yeah right
B	yeah
A	well known business
B	oh no he was a chimney sweep then
A	yeah he's still a business man isn't he
B	oh yeah that's true
A	oh really
B	yeah a vacuum and he he put this big advert in and he got no end of work just in
A	mm
B	cos everybody had coal fires didn't they
A	mm
B	not so many now is there it's all
A	but them vacuum so-called vacuum cleaning sweeps
B	well it was because
A	idea really
B	yeah
A	because if you sweep the chimney
B	that all fall down
A	well most of the dust and that go up with the draft doesn't it
B	that's right
A	if you open all the windows then you get a big draft going up the chimney
B	and the dust would go up yeah
A	and most of the dust is going up and then you just have a big cloth over it
B	a big yeah you have this big canvas
A	mm
B	big canvas sheet
A	mm
B	that clipped against the
A	yeah you know sort of sealed itself
B	seal it all up and then he had a hole in it
A	mm
B	where he would stick the thing through and when the when the soot fell down that got vacced up you see
A	mm
B	and the rest of it as you say went up but er the soot fell down that got vacced away so there was hardly any mess cos I mean that that was the worst thing people used to be cleaning up soot every day
A	well they did a sort of DIY job
B	yeah
A	without no protection or anything just like
B	that's right yeah
A	all the soot fall in the hearth and
B	yeah now with wood burners you get the problem of people burning green wood and have tar running down
C	yeah
A	you told us a story about him making his own creosote
B	yeah that's it that's it
C	yeah he thought it was so and he thought it was wonderful
B	he thought it was wonderful
C	with all this creosote coming out the bottom
B	what was that French? it was a French er like Aga-type thing it was a French one
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about party	Contradiction
A	a Franco Belge or something
B	that's it Franco Belge
C	mm
B	and that fell to bits in the end because it rotted away
A	really?
B	yeah
A	that's some
C	it would do if was all dripping out of the bottom
A	that's some powerful thing to make a that cast iron to fall to bits
B	yeah well that that
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about cast iron	Neutral
A	mind you I suppose it is just the iron bolts
B	the iron bolts and everything that did that fell to bits the bottom dropped out as well didn't it
C	mm
A	I remember once this mate of mine bought this Aga second-hand and he got them in and got me mate
B	oh that's the one that died isn't it
A	mm
B	yeah
A	help him load it up god
B	they're heavy aren't they
A	this is a really old-fashioned one yeah
[ANNOTATION]	they are not sure that they are heavy or not	Neutral
B	yeah
A	and it's full this of mica insulating stuff you know between the two panels
B	wow yeah
A	so we had about that two massive great sacks of this mica stuff we had to shuffle out as well
B	oh dear
A	and it was a terrible job
B	well that was when you were fit and healthy
A	that's right that's when I could lift stuff as well
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	that make you wonder if all that work we did when we were thirty and forty and that
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about a film	Contradiction
B	whether that wore you up quicker
A	yeah
B	physical work
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about book	Contradiction
B	yeah
A	but you would have thought your body would have been able to cope with that
B	you would
C	mm
A	but I think like getting back to this idea of like development of the human body
B	they would wouldn't they
A	wouldn't they
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about a film	Contradiction
B	they would
A	and it's only when they when you get to you know and your
B	that's right no no and this is why pensions now have gone through
A	well this is why it sorts of makes it sort of ridiculous pensions I mean these people who devise that you know you have to be what has it gone up to seventy-two or something like that
B	something like that yeah
A	or seventy-four even perhaps I don't know
B	I don't know something like that yeah
A	increasing you know the the the age at which people can retire
B	course it is yeah yeah
A	you know none of these people have done any hard work
B	they don't know what hard work is do they
A	but if you imagine if you started work at eighteen now
B	yeah
A	and you're working like as a brickie
B	yeah
A	and you're still trying to lay bricks when you're seventy-five
C	oh dear
B	yeah
A	oh it's impossible they say oh well then they can do admin jobs oh yeah there ain't that many admin jobs
B	no of course there aren't
A	around they'd just be just be out of work
B	there's also minors and people like that ain't there
A	well that's right I mean not so many minors these days
B	no but there are some
A	well people work in in er merchant shipping and stuff like that
B	yeah yeah
A	and fishing
B	yeah fishing look at that yeah
A	you know I mean they say oh well there's old so and so he's in his eighties he'll still go out crabbing you know
B	yeah
A	but you know you know he's going through the motions but he ain't actually doing anything
B	no no that's true he'd go out
A	he ain't earning he ain't earning a living
B	on his boat don't they yeah yeah yeah that's that's weird isn't it
A	yeah don't know how that's going to pan out
B	wow it won't will it
A	well even know you know when
B	yeah
A	no one's going to give you a job are they
B	course they aren't no
A	unless you sort of do a bit of odd job in gardening or
B	yeah that's right
C	mm
A	or DIYing or something like that you don't
B	or stacking shelves somewhere in middle of the night that would be different at least
A	mm but then they've got kids to do that haven't they
B	teenagers do that don't they they stay up all night anyway
C	yeah
A	I suppose you'd get a
B	yeah yeah there's always old people doing that ain't there?
A	yeah
B	there are we we knew an old boy up well he he
A	mm
B	he lives in
A	mm
C	mm
B	weren't he?
A	but a
B	yeah
A	pushing the he sort of like looked like a poison dwarf didn't he
B	yeah he does yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	he ain't
B	is he? oh right
A	so you would hope that
C	yeah
A	hope that he retired rather than got the sack
B	yeah yeah
A	cos there was one time that Serco had this sort of er set up in the
B	oh right yeah
A	your sort of
B	yeah
A	and er I went up to em and said oh I've got something to say about
B	did you?
A	waste collection
A	does you know cos I thought you know cos he's the sort of bloke who just gets
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	that's it he gets
A	and er
B	yeah
C	mm
A	but he you know he used to do a good job
B	yeah
A	and you'd only know he didn't you you'd hardly ever see him around and every time you did see him he was smoking a rolly or
B	yeah
A	and picking the rubbish out of the litter bins in the main place
B	oh right
C	mm
A	you know with his stick
B	yeah
A	you know it's ridiculous ain't it you got rubbish bins in town
B	yeah
A	and then they pay someone to go round emptying the rubbish bins
C	yeah yeah
A	with a with a stick
B	with a stick
A	bit by bit
C	how daft
A	you know I mean you'd think someone would go round there and just pull the plastic bag out
B	pull pull the bag out yeah
C	yeah
A	yeah but anyway but the only time you'd notice there'd be a lot of rubbish laying about especially down that alleyway where
B	yeah
A	it's
B	that's it yeah
A	and er then one day you'd go and it'd be spotless
B	yeah
A	and you'd know he'd been around you know it's like he's
B	yeah
A	the week that he'd come round
B	that's right yeah
A	and he did a good job I mean I must admit like in
C	mm
A	there's not that much rubbish laying about
B	no it's pretty good
A	not like there is in
A	yeah
B	we noticed that in
C	yes we did yeah
B	and cos we I
C	it never used to be like that did it?
B	no it never used to be
A	oh I think it did where I lived down on
B	yeah?
A	there used to be a terrible amount of litter about
C	I forgot you lived down
B	yeah
A	oh yeah
A	but that was er sort of a student area
B	yeah
C	you lived at the posh area though didn't you?
A	huh?
C	you lived down the posh area didn't you?
A	the posh end well it was posher I know it was er
B	posher than the bedsit end
C	yeah
A	yeah I looked down the on Zoopla right?
B	yeah
A	and er down the road I lived a house identical to mine was valued at two hundred thousand but my house had a yard next to it
B	oh right
A	so that would've been worth more
C	yeah
A	off-road parking and all that cos that was impossible
B	yeah
A	and a garage
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	so my you know
B	wow yeah
C	mm
A	that's that's worth more than the house I live in now
C	yeah
B	well your house it is pretty good though ain't it?
A	yeah but it's only worth it ain't worth two hundred thousand
B	don't you reckon? you paid sixty for it didn't you?
A	yeah no we
A	what?
C	I reckon it is
A	oh I dunno you look in
B	yeah
A	going for about a hundred and seventy-five
C	are they? oh right
A	you know with all double glazing
C	yeah
A	and all this lot and fancy kitchens and so er
C	mm
B	yeah
C	mm
B	yeah
A	but there again will people pay for it? you know I mean
A	cos that's a
C	no I think they do like the space don't they? gardens give
A	mm well this is the
A	all I'm hoping on is but I bet you if an estate agent come round they won't put it you know they might add you know five or ten thousand on
A	for the size of the garden but I bet not much more
C	mm
B	are you thinking about selling?
A	well I'll sell eventually
B	go and live with
A	yeah
B	yeah that's the sensible thing to do ain't it?
A	well it is yeah
B	yeah
A	but the thing is is that as long as I don't have to sell
C	mm

B	well yeah they didn't even
C	they they
B	district valuer now

B	and value it as well
A	mm
C	and agree with the estate agent
B	and agree with the estate agent how much that should go for
A	mm
C	and they never did that
B	then they never did it
A	so what? you gotta go through all that again then?
B	well we shan't bother shall we?
C	well we
B	and we had one person come
A	yeah?
C	would've been for a year
A	bet they were posh weren't they?
C	yeah quite
B	they were yeah
C	yeah
A	mind you someone someone come down from London they could've been living in a terrace house
C	farmers ex-farmers
B	yeah
A	and come down here and buy this couldn't they?
C	yeah
B	they could do yeah
A	you know
B	yeah
C	mm
A	if it was in the right area
C	yeah but they gotta be in agriculture at the moment so
B	at the moment they gotta be in agriculture or or
A	what? anyone who buy this has gotta be in agriculture?
C	yeah
B	they got or have an agricultural past
C	yeah
A	can't they just come here and start up agricultural thing?
B	I suppose they could I don't know
C	yeah could do if they got proof that they're what they're doing
B	yeah
A	cos a lot of people they
A	ornamental bantams or something like that or
B	that's it yeah
C	yeah
A	you know or fancy geese or ducks
C	well I suppose they could
B	well we were told by
A	and er you know that that qualifies as agricultural don't it?
B	yeah
C	mm
B	and we were told by one estate agent that er well that don't matter all you gotta do is sell some eggs out the out the front
A	mm
B	that's what he
C	but that's not true
B	we don't know whether it's true or not
A	mm
C	yeah
B	but that's what he said
B	so
A	well that's for someone who bought
C	anyway we're not
B	yeah
C	we don't want to go anywhere
A	no
B	well we're not selling anyway
A	well that's right
C	I've got a new workshop
A	just expanding ever upwards and outwards
B	ever ever expanding
C	yeah
B	and when we put in for planning permission on the orchard
C	no no no
B	no I think I don't know I think we could get away with that you know
A	well you could put in planning permission for you goat shed
B	you could do yeah
A	you'd get that automatic
B	yeah
A	cos that's there's a thing that any
B	that's a footprint isn't it
A	any agricultural building can be you build a house on
B	yeah
A	mm
B	that would be a giggle they'd love that would they
A	so you'd have to erm you know sort of say you know I'm building a granny annex or something like that because because then your kids come and you know
B	yeah well we
C	yeah yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah I mean when you see other people what they get away with
B	well that's right yeah
A	get
B	oh yeah
A	he'd sort something out
B	he'd sort something out
A	he'd have a caravan park down there
B	he would wouldn't he
A	cos I mean like for like twenty grand you can you could have a really nice sort of chalet er bungalow
B	bungalow
A	bungalow and shed
B	yeah
A	you know like what do they call them
C	mm
A	but I mean they're all lined out
B	yeah they are yeah
A	you could have a wood burner in it and stuff like that
C	yeah that's true yeah
A	twenty grand just plonk it in there that's only a temporary building isn't it
B	yeah of course it is yeah
A	yeah put down a few slabs
B	yeah yeah that's true
A	yeah that's what I'm thinking maybe I'll do round
B	yeah
A	obviously haven't enough room in her house for two of us
B	hasn't she no I don't suppose she has
C	right
A	well when you think about it I mean like the downstairs dining room is like her office and it's absolutely just always covered with stuff
B	yeah
A	paper and god know what and the upstairs front bedroom is like what she uses for sewing and all this sort of stuff and that's just full of stuff
B	yeah
C	mm
A	and any sort of communal room she's got as a sitting room
B	yeah
A	oh it isn't impossible to expand
B	well you could I tell you what you could have
A	oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
B	you could have a log cabin there
A	well that's what I'm thinking of yeah
B	yeah
A	for a temporary home
B	yeah
A	I'll get one of them you come on the trailer you know on the big crane
B	yeah
A	just lift it up and drop it in
B	and drop it in yeah
A	I nearly built
C	they're expensive
B	you could have had one of them we could have had one of them from the
A	mm
B	big log cabin they just wanted to get rid of it didn't they
C	oh yeah
B	and they offered it for three thousand pounds
A	some
C	it was at a garden show wasn't it
B	that was pretty good that was a pretty big one
A	mm yeah
B	but er we thought no
A	mm but yeah there's a lot of firms making them now you know
B	there are
A	I mean let's face it if I had if I got one wouldn't have to last that long would it
B	no it wouldn't would it
A	I you're not talking about like want something to last fifty years
B	no
C	yeah
B	another two it would be alright wouldn't it
A	yeah eighteen months would probably do
B	eighteen month
B	is she?
A	she's got this job as a teaching assistant
B	yeah
A	you know sort of like going down the ladder
B	yeah
A	and it's at
B	oh right yeah
A	and er it's this art class where it's sort of full of people who are
B	yeah
A	and they're doing this art course but they're all a bit sort of you know damaged not damaged but
B	backward?
A	er no necessarily backward but needy
B	oh
A	in some ways you know some have got severe dyslexia and this particular girl that
B	oh dear
C	oh
A	and er agoraphobia
B	oh dear
A	is that agoraphobia when you don't like mixing with people and or?
C	open spaces
B	that's open spaces yeah
A	yeah well anyway it's sort of like she she don't can't cope with
B	yeah
C	she can get there alright
A	yeah and er
B	yeah
C	mm
B	ah
A	but er
B	is she oh dear
A	yeah and
B	yeah
A	no preparation no marking
B	no
A	you just go there sit with this girl for so many hours
B	oh wow that's
A	you know what I mean
B	no stress then
A	that's right although she does have it bad in the class and that and there is a possibility she could do a day's teaching there
B	oh that will be handy
A	yeah
B	what
A	yeah well she chucked in
B	of course she did yeah
A	so she hasn't got that any more
B	yeah
A	and one of them has been cancelled and the other one has only got five people in when there should be twelve or something
B	twelve yeah that's right
A	and she said I don't know how long that's going to last
B	oh right yeah
A	and er it was like seven days straight off you know doing these you had to go and mark all these papers
B	yeah of course they do yeah
A	between handing in and
B	that was stressful
A	and er well the trouble is
B	ouch
A	right
B	wow
C	mm
B	no way
A	and she said right when she's marking at
B	course it would
A	you know properly
B	yeah
A	I mean I said well you know it's only GCSE you know it's hardly a rigorous standard
B	no
A	you know what I mean it's like O levels and that I mean
B	yeah I suppose you can you could yeah
A	you know and like you know you only need to read a little bit of the final essay or whatever they wrote or the conclusion to see if they'd actually used any of the
B	cos that's why they've eight minutes to do
A	that's right
B	because
A	mm
B	a time in motion study
A	yeah
B	on the paper itself and well lots of people have got these this this fast reading
A	that's right and it will also I mean I'm just I mean it's always subjective anyway
B	yeah
A	and you'd be able to tell if someone's taken any care over it or
B	well of course you would yeah
A	you know got decent sketch book or you just sort of flick through and check this check that oh right you know and
B	yeah
A	what grade? oh C
B	yeah
C	she didn't have to write any comments either?
A	erm
C	cos that would take time wouldn't it
A	I don't know I mean
C	right
A	but anyway she was all set for this
B	yeah
A	but it was in in er erm
B	oh what
C	oh so she hasn't done any of it
A	so she'd have to drive to
C	oh
A	work there
C	right
B	and drive all the way back
A	all day and then drive home again
C	oh
B	oh that's too much isn't it
A	and then
B	god
A	two of these days she'd then have to teach in the evening when she got home
B	oh well
C	oh
B	but you would think that
A	and like
C	I thought you meant she'd got the job
A	well she had got the job but she had to turn it down she's sort of like weighing it all up
C	but she's not doing it
A	but
C	mm
B	yeah
A	she's got to drive home and teach this evening
B	yeah
A	she falls asleep coming back from
C	oh dear
B	yeah
A	you know and then gets home and then she can sort of got enough time to make some soup and then she goes out and does maths
C	mm
A	and so what you know this is what I was thinking you can't do that and driving back from
C	you can't
B	no
A	cos you know the thing is that I said to her if you were going to do it what you could do is to stay down there in some cheap
B	hotel yeah
A	you know hotel
B	yeah
A	and then you could work longer hours and just go to the hotel have something to eat go to kip get up and do it again
B	yeah
A	and then she said oh yeah that's what I was thinking of but that would cost forty quid a night
B	that would cost forty at least wouldn't it yeah
A	and you know even if you got a deal you know
B	yeah
A	which you probably could do but forty quid a night that's not forty quid you're going to get in your pocket is it it's
B	no no
C	no probably probably that in petrol though isn't it
A	erm
C	there and back
A	no I think that was sixty miles each way so
C	suppose you wouldn't have to do it again
B	well a hundred and twenty mile you can do that
A	no it would be a couple of gallons at least
B	that would only be a couple of gallons
A	probably with three gallons alright two two and a half three
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	but they yeah but I mean the thing is it's a you know she's sort of
C	it's not worth it
A	cos her friend does it you see
B	oh I see yeah
A	but some people even when they get quite old can drive
B	yeah
A	I mean I can remember when I used to have to drive all over the place
B	all over the place yeah
A	you know when I was working at
B	yeah
A	and er I used to take that time to wind down from work
B	yeah
A	I used to find it quite relaxing
B	yeah
A	sort of driving back you know and the time sort of totally wound up working by the time you got home again you're sort of like okay again you know
B	yeah yeah
A	and er but
B	no
A	she finds driving a you know sort of a chore
B	yeah
A	like today she can't keep keep awake
C	she can't share the lift with her friend?
A	well no I don't think that her friend comes from the other side of
B	oh and she still has to drive quite a way anyway
A	that's right yeah but even then getting back in time to go to work
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	no it doesn't sound very good though does it
A	no
B	no it doesn't no
A	yeah well I
C	I wouldn't do it
A	no it's not worth it
C	I know I wouldn't do it
A	it's really not worth
B	no it isn't is it
A	it's the sort of thing you can do when you're young
C	I don't like the driving too far anyway
A	mm
C	it's such a long way isn't it
A	well like I was saying I mean I drove to
C	long enough
B	yeah
A	and er yesterday you know I got out the car and my knees were like legs like jelly
B	yeah
A	really you know sort of get out the car
B	yeah
A	and you sort of well hang on a minute mm
B	yeah
A	like stand so I learned against something or I'm going to fall down
B	it's like having land lovers lug legs isn't it? you know
C	mm
A	yeah
B	we do that don't we
C	yeah we do
B	we had to stop on a on a on a service station or somewhere
C	well we stop halfway
A	yeah
B	to use their loos of course
A	yeah
B	and then have a walk around
C	yeah
A	but I'm alright in the car it's only when I get out
B	yeah it's when you get out
C	yeah that's what it is
A	my legs are sort of like oh
B	you get up and you go oh
C	mm
A	yeah
B	yeah that's really strange isn't it
C	you start wobbling for a little while
B	yeah they do wobble yeah
A	mm
B	weird
A	anyway I better what is it? half four?
B	half four yeah
A	I don't know the day go when your busy doesn't it
C	days gone
B	that do don't it huh yeah that go faster when you're enjoying yourself
A	well I spent sixty pence already today
B	have you? what on?
A	parking meter
B	oh of course that's you have to park down
A	yeah luckily I found one really close
B	oh that's handy
A	but it's
B	what's that sixty pence an hour or?
A	no no that's thirty pence for fifteen minutes
B	huh?
C	oh
A	and I thought to myself
C	what's that parking meter?
B	yeah
A	yeah parking meter
C	oh
A	well it's not too bad is it
C	no
B	well it ain't too bad if you're only going to take half an hour
A	well that's right you know well that's the idea of parking meters it's short term isn't it
B	yeah
C	mm
A	but
B	that's the problem isn't it that's the problem
A	you know like
B	we we always try and park in a in a car park when we go cos it's we we if you're going to go to
A	yeah
B	and that's that
C	yeah
A	but some car parks are better than others aren't they
B	Bonds is good Bonds is alright cos you go in Bonds and spend a bit of money and you get your car park paid for
A	spend to save eh?
B	yeah
A	have a scone?
B	yeah
A	what in the cafeteria?
B	well we did when we met oh it was about ten year ago we met
C	no we went in Tesco's didn't we
A	no that was Tesco's that was
B	oh it was Tesco's was it oh
C	yeah
A	and we went in and there you were swanning about in the blooming restaurant
B	oh it was Tesco's was it?
A	yeah
B	oh dear I thought it was Bonds
C	yeah
B	I've had I've a scone in Bonds
A	you haven't had a meal in Morrisons?
B	no I haven't had a meal in Morrisons
C	no but we have thought about it
A	well I tell you what sometimes I go there it smells really delicious
B	that does
C	yeah
A	and you've got all these people tucking away and eating their grub
B	yeah
C	they do we have thought about it on the way to places haven't we
B	we have yeah
C	we stop cos we stop at Morrisons sometimes to get
A	yeah
B	we did stop at Sainsbury's when we were when we were on the way to
C	oh yeah I did
B	where was it?
C	I don't know
B	anyhow we were on the way to somewhere towards Wales
C	mm
B	we stopped at Sainsbury's and we had fish and chips with two plates please
A	oh right yeah
B	and we halved the chips
C	mm
B	cos you get loads you know
A	yeah
B	and
A	yeah I must admit sometimes when these people er
B	yeah
A	I mean they're very down at down to earth people but they must be loaded because they spend half their life going around
B	eating out
A	going no going on cruises
B	oh crikey yeah
A	and you know she was something in the government of Canada living on a pension
B	oh right
A	and he was some professor of
B	oh right
A	you know doing research into coral reefs and so he must be on a hell of a pension as well
C	yeah
A	and er but you know to talk to them it's like talking like us here you know
B	yeah
A	and er they come and visit their cousins once a year who live in
A	cos the woman actually comes from
B	oh I see
A	and er they always invite us out for a
B	yeah
A	and for a walk along the coast and have a meal
B	yeah
A	and we go there and they said oh no it's alright we'll get them and we always have fish and chips right
B	yeah
A	but it's the same on these sort of coastal paths there's a pub in
B	yeah
A	load of fish and chips don't you
B	yeah
A	massive great and you think
B	yeah that is
A	but I suppose they charge a bloody fortune and
B	well they yeah
A	and they give you loads for your money
B	well they do yeah well chips especially yeah
A	well that's right I mean I don't suppose it course I know most of the ingredients but I've never paid so
B	I mean I don't know what they
A	the story it's always oh you paid last time we'll pay we'll pay I'm thinking no
B	this is costing a fortune
A	but she's like that well she'll she'll walk in say oh I'll get the round in
B	yeah
A	you know like there's you know six of you there and every drink is of three quid
B	yeah
A	I think no
C	mm
A	someone who got twenty quid is not worth anything
B	no
A	buy the drinks
B	that's right god I don't know the last time I went in a pub so I don't know how much it is
A	well you can reckon about three three quid a drink can't you
B	well I don't drink yeah I don't drink much anyway
A	but that's like the other day she said oh by the way next Thursday we've got so and so coming we're going to I'm going to do a meal you know and I'm thinking why? and she's invited yeah right eight or nine people
B	what?
A	to come to this meal and they're all really posh well off people
B	yeah
A	and I'm thinking mm come off it
B	no
C	yeah
A	and I'd say I'm thinking you know you can't afford to do this sort of thing
B	no
C	mm
B	no that's a bit silly isn't it
A	you know cos they do you know no matter what it's going to cost you
B	yeah
A	she said oh I was thinking I'll only do shepherd's pie or something and have a nice starter and a nice pudding and I'm thinking yeah yeah
B	yeah well a nice starter is enough money and a nice pudding is enough money
A	that's right
B	so I mean shepherd's pie
A	yeah but you've still got to buy the mince haven't you
B	you've got to buy the mince
A	and she'll only buy organic beef
B	yeah which is quite a lot of money
A	yeah it is
C	mm
B	yeah
A	I don't know
B	dear oh dear
A	no I won't
B	you won't
A	I can't teach her anything these days
B	yeah
A	as soon as I say anything that's out there hang on
B	that's the
C	yeah
A	oh dear oh dear
B	but she doesn't look on Wikipedia does she?
A	no no
B	cos that's always wrong
C	I don't like Wikipedia
B	oh I have never been on it apparently apparently people just
A	really?
C	it comes up all the time
B	does it?
C	to ask question yeah
B	oh
C	if you want to
A	if you put a query in you always get a Wikipedia answer don't you
C	there all there's always something
B	is it? oh
C	once you put in oranges it will come up Wikipedia oranges are
A	well I don't mind Wikipedia actually it's usually got some sort of information on long dead people
B	oh it's got information
A	or something like that or
B	yeah
C	mm
B	but
A	yeah well not any more they can't
B	isn't there? they can't do it any more?
A	no
B	oh
A	no well
B	oh right
A	and like the people who are sort of started it up and are keen on it I mean you're talking about fifty thousand around the world
B	yeah
A	members of Wikipedia they sort of do a probably more than fifty thousand it would have to be they do like a when you put some information in well they they can run their eye over it
B	oh I see
A	and er before that it doesn't go straight in any more
B	no
A	at one time it used to go straight in
B	yeah
A	cos
B	oh right
A	yeah but I don't think happens any more I think you have to submit it and then
B	no
A	you know they will sort of check it out
B	it's all checked by loads and loads of people
A	well no sort of one person who just sort of looks and thinks a bit
B	oh I see
A	looks roughly
B	yeah
A	cos of the cos everything on there has got a little number by it and then underneath is a massive great where this information comes from
B	come from I see
A	you see
B	yeah I see
A	so if you say David Cameron got fined you know two pound ten for shop lifting when he was twelve
B	they'd have to find out whether it was true or not
A	they'd look at that and they'd verify it you know check that
B	yeah
A	they wouldn't just let it go in
B	no no because that would be wrong
A	that's right but it is like the whole idea is good isn't it
B	yeah it is good that's brilliant yeah
A	I mean when you look up
B	yeah
A	what people have put in well
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	well maybe loads maybe not depends on
C	most of them direct you to the website
B	yeah
A	yeah yeah that depends depends you know how many people are interested in putting the stuff on but you'd definitely have something about
A	and they're all sort of things all sorts of things
B	yeah

B	it was two hundred pound that that one in there
C	oh was it? right
B	yeah
C	the aluminium one
B	aluminium one
C	we've got one aluminium they're expensive to to get done
A	yeah well this is the thing you know people you know they go to somewhere like QD store and see these massive great you know printed on canvas pictures
C	yeah
B	yeah yeah
A	you know for about you know twenty-five quid
C	and so cheap
B	yeah
A	and they expect to buy anything for that price
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	whereas if you
B	but these are one-offs you see
A	but you know they have printed if you had it printed yourself
B	yeah
C	mm
A	you know it costs a lot more than that doesn't it
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	that does
C	yeah
B	I think that one in there cost me ninety quid
A	yeah wouldn't be surprised at all
B	on on aluminium don't it
C	yeah
B	ninety pound
C	and that was er on offer
B	yeah that was offer on offer
C	like half price
A	mm yeah
B	yeah
C	er in general don't we
B	yeah we do yeah
A	yeah
C	er yeah
B	oh right yeah
A	and he said he's sort of oh they came out with some special offer so he got in on that
B	yeah
A	special discount
B	one for two and stuff
A	sort of ordered it well he always does it on off anyway you know
B	yeah
A	there was this super offer and he worked it all out and got there and it was going to cost him more than it than normal
B	was it?
A	yeah
B	oh of course the the funny thing about that them photo books is you can have a photo book for say twenty quid and that will give you like twenty-six pages
A	mm
B	but these offer ones are sixty pages
A	mm
B	and they cost an
C	yeah can be
B	they're on offer
A	mm
B	and then you've got to look at it and there's sixty pages well it takes an awful lot of photographs to fill in
C	well it's about three times the price isn't to compensate yeah
B	yeah yeah
A	no I think this particular offer that
B	yeah
A	you would get a discount tokens
B	ah yeah and you have to pay in advance
A	every time you you got these you know had a book
B	yeah
C	right
A	and as he was going to do this Christmas run he thought well I'll do that you know get a bit off
B	yeah
A	and then he
B	oh dear
C	oh
B	that's pathetic
A	mm
B	cos you can have a you can have a photos printed at say
A	mm
B	er six by six by four photo
A	mm
A	that's right yeah
C	yeah
A	yeah but them photo books I mean
B	they are yeah
A	but I think they're overpriced for what they
B	they are yeah
A	when you consider it's like
B	yeah probably yeah yeah
A	you know it probably comes with a pre-printed stick or in a bag that's the right size and they just put them in a bag put the sticker on chuck them out
B	yeah
C	yeah yeah
A	cos I think there's totally automated process
B	that must be yeah
A	and you know when you think about the volume they actually use
B	yeah
A	you know they must have paid for them machines a hundred times over
B	they must have done now yeah
A	you know
C	mm
B	yeah
A	cos the thing is is that it you know they look fairly good but the actual hard cover is nothing special is it
B	no
A	you know what I mean?
B	well you can pay for the you pay extra for certain covers
C	yeah
A	yeah but I mean that's only different sort of sort of material or fabric or something like that
B	yeah yeah
A	but you know the actual you know cos I was looking at the stuff which like the arts college
B	yeah
A	cos they've got their own sort of bookbinding thing
B	oh I see yeah
A	but
B	yeah
A	of the design and the
B	that's it yeah
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	and you look at them and they're really good quality bindings on them books
B	yeah yeah
A	you know they are really well done
B	yeah
C	mm right
A	and I don't think they pay
B	but you won't them for to last don't you if you're going to pay that sort of money for them
C	yeah you do
A	that's right yeah
B	I mean that's no good having a binding that's going to fall to bits
A	that's right
C	yeah
B	after a few usages you know
A	well I was thinking of putting you know getting a photo album and just printing pictures of and put them in right
B	yeah
A	and I've started printing pictures and I'm sort of looking for you know just like the you used to get like a book you know when you open it and it's you know you can put your photos in that
B	that's it you did yeah
A	well I tell you what you you know you used to get them for next to nothing didn't you
B	yeah yeah and now they're
A	they're properly expensive now if you can get them
B	yeah
A	I was I was absolutely
B	we had
A	you know really surprised how how difficult it is to actually find a photo book
C	right
A	for your pictures
C	to put your photos in
B	we had a photo book right to put your pictures in which had cellophane covers on the picture
A	mm yeah
C	yeah there was a sticky band kind of a sticky
A	yeah that's right but they're fairly rubbish aren't they
B	but they after a time the cellophane stuck to the photograph
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	and you couldn't take it off and they
A	mm
B	ruined all the pictures
C	yeah
A	yeah the best ones were those sort of little plastic things where you just slot them in
C	yeah you want those slot in ones
B	yeah where you just slide the sides in yeah
C	so they're not damaged at all and you can
A	that's right
B	yeah
C	check them
A	I mean I've got a couple of little ones which are sort of flip books
B	yeah
A	you know them sort of smaller just sort A4 size and they've got you know your flip you know
B	yeah that's it yeah
C	yeah
A	they they're pretty practical but you know they not not quite as good as the book
B	no no
A	you know cos a book you open that way
B	that's right
A	and you've got a space to put a little bit of information in there as well about what the pictures are actually about you know
B	and they have
C	yeah
B	now they have all different types of books some books you you can open and you can't see it cos that open and that don't lay flat
A	oh right
C	oh yeah Photobox do them don't they for an extra
B	and Photobox do that as an extra
A	oh right
C	they do lots of things as extras
B	so you know you don't you don't want a book like like a an ordinary paper back that you have to push down to read round the corner
C	start off
A	right
B	of the
C	or to spoil your photo
B	to and that spoil the photo you know
A	they could do a spiral bound couldn't they
B	well they do spiral bounds now which are lay what what they call lay flat books which are more expensive you see
A	yeah
C	mm
B	but some spiral books bound books get stuck halfway and then then they wear wear away and
A	yeah bits fall out
B	and bits fall out yeah
C	mm
A	the best thing is put them in a book and never use it
B	that's it
C	that's it
B	that's it
C	the answer
A	anyway
C	yeah
B	I think the best thing is is to
C	that's a Turk's head
C	would you like one to try?
B	do you want one?
A	no I'm not
C	no this was this wasn't ripe but
A	why? what's wrong with that one?
C	well it wasn't ripe you know
B	well you didn't boil it
A	I know I know
C	mm?
B	you didn't cook it
C	it's not cooked no
B	no you probably
C	well no I didn't
B	the bit the bit we had you didn't cook
C	no no I didn't
A	well there's more there's more sort of peeling and to get the stuff out
B	yeah
A	on these than there is in butternut squashes isn't there
B	yeah there is
A	cos they aren't easy to peel are they
B	no no they look good though don't they
A	oh yeah that's lovely sitting there
C	mm different
B	we can we could put a face on it and hang him up you
A	yeah yeah you do that
C	right
