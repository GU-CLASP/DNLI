A	yeah
B	but it looks further in
A	you were
B	at school
A	the first time you watched it
B	they showed it to us in in
A	tut
B	it's because I thought the men in the NASA suits were gonna come in through the back door the way that they do with ET

A	mm
B	it is pretty scary
A	er yeah
B	yeah
A	I haven't spoken to them since then so
B	oh you should get
A	I know
A	I know
B	but then that's when it always feels does really um putting pressure on yourself makes it worse
A	yeah
B	no
A	at the moment
B	no
A	mm
B	just see how you go
A	mm
B	no
A	no
B	I knew everyone
A	so everyone felt kind of comfortable I hope

B	yeah
A	oh okay
B	du du du
A	there you go
B	that might be er er when it vibrates I dunno what that means

B	no
A	oh
B	huh
A	do they?
B	the effects from the first edition
A	yeah
B	versions
A	mm
B	all that sort of carry-on
A	well I would've thought so
B	there's er something quite charming about that
A	oh okay
B	it's it's a puppet again
A	oh okay
B	it's really you know that sort of
A	oh
B	creepy I don't know  I don't know  whether it's just because you've you're used to the puppet and
A	mm
B	now it's not
A	yeah
B	and now they're a bit too I dunno
A	mm
A	no it's fine
B	well if you're sure
A	of course
B	oh thanks
A	no
B	oh
A	Cos you're so good at it now
A	no
A	that's it
B	housemate's birthday was last week
B	er she's quite into her baking
A	oh
B	quite a pro
A	uh
B	and apparently she just turned her down
A	oh no
B	she just ate a bit
A	tut
B	so she brought it in for us to eat
A	huh
B	so had caterpillar cake in the office on Friday
A	mm
A	huh
B	it's ridiculous isn't it
A	that's just ridiculous
B	it's like learning to drive essentially
A	that's just unbelievable
B	I mean I'm sure you know feed and hay is expensive
A	that's just  that's just  crazy
B	thing is buying a horse is is not very expensive
A	mm
B	a horse
A	well I dunno
B	keeping it at the stables
A	yeah
B	vet's bills and saddles and
A	yeah
B	all the rest
A	absolutely
B	and shoes and what have you
A	mm
B	she's just not attractive at all is she
A	no
B	just cos she's er she's
A	er
B	Jerry's daughter isn't she
A	yeah
B	no
A	no
B	mm
A	mm
B	never
A	tut
B	so you don't lose it
A	yeah
B	and that's quite good considering
A	I didn't know that
B	when um tut when
A	mm
B	we came out of the  out of the  house and the next door neighbours had parked across our drive
A	mm
B	even though they go mental if we even
A	yeah
B	park
A	yeah
B	on their side
A	mm
B	um
A	mm
B	up their path and the car locked itself
A	tut
B	so that's good
A	yeah
B	it's
A	mhm
B	but er I'm so used to pressing unlock when I'm I often press unlock when I mean to press lock when I'm walking away
A	right
B	so it's reassuring to know that if I were to do that and not double-check
A	yeah
B	it will just lock itself
A	exactly
B	which is really good I think for a basic model car
A	absolutely
B	Good old
A	I'm playing Boggle
B	been playing Boggle?
A	mm
B	oh I love Zumba
A	it looks more fun than some things
B	it is really fun
A	well I would've thought so
B	it's such a good work-out
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	mhm
B	so that's quite good
A	mm
B	really
A	mm
B	and it's good
A	mm
B	last week and you know you're all sweaty and my colleague Tim came in and er you're just really embarrassed

B	mm
A	so
B	mm
A	and if I'm gonna do it then you know
B	yeah
A	mm
B	stare at the wall for a bit
A	no
B	I mean she doesn't really have time I suppose
A	she's er it's just the tiredness
B	mm
A	remember coming home from work and not wanting to do it so
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	that's why batch cooking is so good when you do live alone
A	mm
B	er cook a load up and then so that's one night where you're cooking but then the next couple of nights

B	Cos they're alive when you dissect them?
A	no
B	well he said that's chloroform
A	oh
B	unless that does kill frogs because it's
A	maybe
B	powerful?

B	well she told me the other day
A	I'd be surprised
B	but
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Kerry's shop is a pet-shop.	Neutral
B	left
A	I
B	start making noises
A	yeah
B	and you can start you now
A	mm
B	and
A	mm

[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A is never astonished.	Contradiction
A	mm
B	you know
A	mm
A	Dido's got loads of frogs in her pond
B	who?
A	and she loves them
B	urgh
A	and they're big things as well

B	well I'm sure she would text me if she was was finished
[ANNOTATION]	A female will text back after work.	Entailment
A	it's strange that she hasn't been in touch
B	well that's what makes me think that um
A	that is weird
B	she's still working
A	yeah
A	it is
B	a ridiculous day
A	it is
B	without them having
A	absolutely
B	to do an extra hour
A	mm
B	huh

A	is it?
B	yeah
A	pretty awful
B	it's that sort of deliberately messy
A	mm
B	controlled messy
A	hmm
B	pretty hilarious
A	that's strange that she's not answering at all
B	well it makes me
A	mm
B	and the thing is because I can't pull up
A	no
B	get out and see if she's in the shop and see what's going on
A	well if you  if you  want to get on do
B	which is a shame
A	I know
B	and I just don't want it to rain on her
A	and it's really nice of you to think that

B	er cos I wanna go and have dinner and stuff so
A	well of course you do
A	as I say you're welcome to stay darling
B	I know
