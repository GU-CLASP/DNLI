B	mm
A	now we picked up the pig she likes the pig and then somebody said to us oh do you want to take this bear as well? look I hate that bear I don't I don't want that bear

A	no
B	that's
A	nothing
B	ah ah that's alright
A	yeah it's alright
B	there's a few good bits there
A	bet I could have got probably some really cool stuff somebody had erm booked up some stuff you could see it all erm well one of them was a baby bath and stuff but they had other bits and pieces mm mm oh never mind never mind what are you up to
B	well she slept how long did it take to walk back? fifteen minutes?
A	yeah
B	she has to sleep the whole way
A	so it's a fifteen minute nap then alright fair enough that's okay that's fine isn't it?
B	what do you want to drink?
A	erm I would love a
B	mm mm
A	I'm gonna start drinking camomile tea a bit earlier in the day
B	mm how do you spell camomile?
A	I don't know well no just as it's as it's well
B	I was just putting myself in the transcribers position
B	well we can do it today or tomorrow
A	well I thought we we could always have dinner there couldn't we?
B	mm mm
A	I mean I'd like to try it I've forgotten what erm
B	we'd have to take her pram
A	yeah yeah take the pram well yeah
B	hm?
A	yeah
B	well it's too late to walk around carrying her
A	yeah yeah agreed okay take the pram one person can have the trolley one person can have the pram yeah that'll work out fine and then
B	they they must have
A	mm
B	mm
A	yeah they do erm right at the end by the plants
B	at the beginning just near where they've got that weird escalator
A	oh yeah yeah there must be one there's gotta be unless you have to walk all the way through the front and go up those but then that might be good because we'll be at the plants to start
B	yeah no it's IKEA
A	mm
A	so I was thinking if we can get to the plants and then erm text
B	mm mm
A	why not? and if he says oh the van's in
B	mm mm
A	and then I've got to get into my routine of looking after the plants again
B	what else did we need to get before we go?
B	yeah she's nearly there isn't she?
A	she needs a cup for the little bit of water that she's been drinking
B	yeah
A	so she can practice and yeah and then she then she'll start on water soon as a drink like when it's hot and stuff I don't really know I guess you'll just tell when when she gets to that stage you'll just start realising what she needs she doesn't need a lot of drink until she starts eating because she needs to drink milk from the
B	no
B	mm mm
A	that's dinner lovely yeah yeah that'd be nice so that means go soon
B	that means go very soon doesn't it?
A	yeah
B	she needs to be back here at half six
A	be back at seven yeah about half six seven yeah do you want to go down there? here we go
B	mm mm
A	I thought yep
B	slowly it's taking a
A	well we
B	well I think once we've got these big plants
[ANNOTATION]	She has to return before six o'clock.	Contradiction
A	mm
B	think its come out so
A	and the photos that I've been
B	saying that for half a year
A	big plants and photos and then sorted and then it's just little bits like now that you've taken the little bits off that table onto that cabinet
B	mm
A	it looks really bare and boring you can just see all the wires at the back of the TV
B	yeah
A	so
[ANNOTATION]	The wires of the TV are well covered and can't be seen.	Contradiction
B	well I was thinking about moving that music stuff into the other room now
A	what? no we need music here
B	but we never use it
A	only because the computer's disappeared where's it gone? I thought
B	well cos I've been using it cos I've been using the second sound card well it's useful having two computers
A	see I thought that you were gonna get your new computer the old computer was gonna stay here for music?
[ANNOTATION]	It's very helpful to have two computers.	Entailment
B	well that's what I thought at first but cos the internet's not working from down
A	but
B	oh right
A	erm
B	mm
A	cos when we were travelling she we didn't listen to much music and since we've been back the computer's been in the other room
B	yeah I've been playing guitar and stuff to her
A	yeah yeah yeah there's that so loves that but just generally on in the house
B	mm
A	I think it I mean when I put the music on she was quiet and happy and yeah she really enjoyed it
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A put some techno music on.	Neutral
B	mm
A	so
B	erm no
A	it's just a shame that when you click on the TV you have to just play by the artist
B	but you can't do that cos there's thousands of folders
A	yeah
B	well it has to be the jukebox
[ANNOTATION]	There's an option and you can play by the music genre.	Contradiction
B	I'm using it a lot like in conjunction with the other one
A	yeah well I'll get jukebox on mine download the music onto mine
B	er how much space have you got on yours?
A	hm don't know
B	is that eh is it on now?
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A can't download any music.	Contradiction
A	how much space do I need?
B	erm I don't know I guess my music comes to
A	but then it's annoying because you can't listen to music and do stuff on the computer at the same time
B	you'll probably need about fifty-sixty gigs
A	fifty-sixty gigs
B	it's a guess
A	how do I find out?
B	just go to my computer
A	well I've got on my local disc on my D drive
B	yeah
A	I've got ninety-seven gigabytes free
B	well you could put it on there but it's gonna take up most of that
A	I've got look how many I've got loads of drives I've got this on the C drive is the only drive that I've used yeah and okay so that's going down I need to move some stuff across I've got an E drive which has a hundred and twenty-six gigabytes
B	really?
A	an F drive which has a hundred and fifty gigabytes and a D drive ninety-seven point six gigabytes
B	that's good
A	hm?
B	good the C drive you just wanna keep for Windows really how big's your C drive?
A	mm it's sixty-nine gigs
B	mm
A	but erm I've used quite like about forty
B	yeah I'd I'd keep that just for like Windows and updates and things like that
A	you know why? cos I've just been saving everything to the desktop
B	yeah like photos and music but erm something else
A	okay and all of my
B	well documents are tiny but well the
A	mm
B	nah it's only moving some folders across
A	mm
B	mm
A	so I have to make
B	mm so you've got loads of space on there
A	so I can make a D drive for erm my work my photos or something and an F drive for music hm?
B	course
A	mm mm
B	what?
A	my
B	for what?
A	erm I've forgotten what I signed up to now
B	yeah I've just I've clicked that box now just remembered my password
A	really?
B	yeah
A	so many times
B	just got to the stage you know where you've just got too many yeah if someone stole my computer they could have a field day
A	but they can't get in it without the er first password
B	mm yeah
A	so you alright then? oh whoops
B	okay what's that about?
A	erm powerful tools for teaching and learning digital storytelling er course info and next week I've got write rhetorical composing and then I I've got an English composition one cos I wanted to do some writing courses
B	rhetorical composition?
A	mm
B	what's that?
A	hold on I've got the digital storytelling up
B	oh sorry
A	I'll tell you about this one erm
B	oh
A	just with still images audio
B	mm
A	but I thought I might get some tips on using some digital stuff anyway
B	mm mm
A	so so I'll have a look at that
A	erm it's a course where writers exchange words ideas talents and support introduced to rhetorical concepts ideas and techniques to inform and persuade audiences that will help you become a more effective consumer and producer or written visual and
B	mm
A	I think that sounds quite good
B	it sounds a little bit vague
A	yeah
A	don't really say anything else really oh the syllabus is thinking rhetorically oh that's just gonna be responding rhetorically where you do a writing exchange in a peer review
B	mm mm
A	arguing rhetorically seeing rhetorically
B	I don't really understand the focus of that
A	I don't know but anyway I'll have a look at that
B	mm mm
A	I've got another one erm starting oh the English composition one
B	mm
A	which one?
B	the R book
A	oh yeah
B	really good
A	what's it about?
B	well it's like I said it starts with Edward Bernays
A	who?
B	Edward Bernays
A	who set up a meeting
B	this guy who wrote the book
A	okay
B	and basically
A	mm
B	because he basically had manipulated the whole meeting from even before he got there till things happening after the meeting he manipulated the whole thing just to him a lesson
A	what? how?
B	like he er
A	you are you hungry?
B	erm yeah I can't remember what the name of what's the name of the book? the name of the book is erm
A	yeah?
B	just as an example of his power you know cos he was showing his power basically
A	yeah
B	and they said oh yeah we've we thought it was a good idea this year to a er a big forum on consumer images you know we've got such and such involved and it's exactly what Bernays used in just his like flippant kind of example in the interview
A	really?
B	yeah so he must have just picked up the phone after the interview and set the balls in motion
A	really?
B	it was just erm
A	no what one?
B	erm well you remember all these stories that come out before wars you know been trying to get justification in in their action into a war
A	yeah
B	like they did with Syria recently with the chemical weapons
A	yeah
B	same thing in Iraq they did a massive thing saying they got this fifteen-year-old girl to say that the erm Saddam Hussein's kind of private army had been going round hospitals and taking babies out of incubators
A	oh
B	leaving them on the cold concrete floors to to die
A	mm
B	you know and this testimony came from a fifteen-year-old girl who got up in front of a it was like a UN panel and you know and stated it erm which after the war was found out that this fifteen-year-old girl was the daughter of the Kuwaiti ambassador
A	oh
B	basically on the payroll of the CIA and er you know fabricated the whole thing but the power's done right? I mean
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	and as they're saying you know like now you can see it going on in Syria and
A	mm
B	cos it's just about shaping people's minds into justifying movement into a certain direction it's just so powerful
A	mm
B	like another one when remember that erm that in the last Gulf War
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	that was a
A	that was
B	that was an image
A	major
B	that needed to happen because it was a shifting point you know it was winning hearts and minds basically
A	yeah
B	it was like yeah America has or whoever erm has got control we're the is the symbol of winning the war
A	yeah
B	of take or remove the statue and it had people in the streets like cheering and
A	mm yeah
B	I mean like I read no I read erm
A	mm
B	he said that all of the journalists were kind of shepherded into these hotels around that square and basically it was rent a mob you know who came in it was nothing it wasn't you know they were paid people to come in
A	yeah yeah that was the one yeah
B	and pull down the statue it was all staged
A	mm
B	but the way it was shown on the media for days
A	oh it was on every day for
B	yeah
A	weeks
B	and that was it was like yes we've won and for the opening
A	mm
B	they must have seen that as a a step as well that okay Saddam Hussein's lost
A	oh yeah that's what the book is all about
B	yeah
A	not just images though?
B	no no talking about the history at the moment it's gonna go back to the first world was now I think talk about that because I mean the British were masters of propaganda in the First World War
A	yeah
B	erm and then you had people like Edward Bernays and
A	can you pass me a tissue?
B	erm and then the Second World War Joseph Goebbels kind of took their ideas
A	who?
B	the Nazi propaganda minister
A	who?
B	Joseph Goebbels
A	Goebbels
B	erm and he took like British ideas as well from the First World War
A	oh no no no no no
B	the most successful propaganda campaign in history really
B	erm and then it's kind of moved on to er kind of consumer based mind control
A	mm yeah
B	er which was what Bernays was writing about cos he was the nephew of Freud
A	yeah but it's just yeah it's quite crazy how it must have all
B	yeah it was all about the
A	but still
B	yeah oh yeah it's still
A	but now you've got the internet and the TV where you can just go boom there it is
B	yeah yeah well it's changing though because people are becoming slightly more savvy about it you know they can see through it
A	well yeah
B	so they're constantly having to make it more sophisticated and even more hidden you know erm like remember that erm on GMTV or whatever it is called now remember I got so angry with that guy the doctor who was questioning immunisations with babies
A	oh yeah
B	and the way that he was took to pieces erm by that other guest they had on and they they did that repeatedly over two weeks on different channels and newspapers and
A	yeah
B	it it was a systemated er systematic PR campaign basically I would have loved to have investigated that cos I'm sure that was funded by people like Glaxosmithkline
A	do you
B	and Bayer yeah
A	well if you see it on loads of channels it's a bit suspect isn't it?
B	well look it's the arguments they set up cos they weren't
A	yeah false arguments and
B	false arguments it
A	change direction quite easily
B	yeah I mean the argument they used very kind of emotive things like
A	yeah
B	that was basically the main kind of
A	and you want yeah and that erm what's the other argument? that you say that
B	yeah
A	and things like that
B	yeah
A	and it's just wrong because for the whole community
B	yeah
A	it's wrong
B	yeah
A	that's the argument
B	yeah exactly
A	for the whole community it's wrong not just for your child your neglecting your child and neglecting the community
B	yeah
A	you're putting everybody else in danger
B	yeah
A	stuff like that
B	and that's the spin they gave it
A	and yeah that's the spin of erm of them that their main argument was probably about the mercury within the injections and
B	yeah no that's not mentioned
A	no?
B	ever
A	no it's a different argument
B	and and it was very much it wasn't a group of scientists that were saying this it was one person
A	yeah
B	one lunatic
A	oh yeah yeah he got
B	oh he had to leave the country
A	yeah
B	he lives in America now
A	does he?
B	yeah
A	I thought he lived in Europe
B	no he's got quite a successful TV thing I think in America or something
A	oh really?
B	erm but yeah you can't
A	yeah
B	because you have to just pander towards the fucking corporate objectives
A	and that's just because yeah and it's not science anymore because you're not allowed to come up with a different hypothesis for something if
B	no you have to agree with the consensus
A	or if you do people just twist the argument and just say something like that
B	yeah
A	like they weren't even discussing the what's in the vaccines the vaccines fitting er erm contaminated with HIV or the vaccines getting contaminated with other diseases
B	mm
A	or the mercury content of the nothing like that
B	no no no and all that
A	nothing like that that's not the argument for them is it?
B	no
A	so if you start saying something like that they just bounce it back to you and
B	yeah
A	debate into
B	and it's things like erm swine flu
A	yeah that's the same as well
B	like chicken flu all these things these are all
A	chicken flu? bird flu
B	bird flu whatever
A	mm
B	who pump millions into these PR campaigns stir up a load of fear
A	oh yeah
B	erm just look at the people who've died it's it's miniscule absolutely miniscule
A	well that
B	but look at the money they've made they've brought in injections to every single person on this planet now
A	oh yeah absolutely yep
B	at birth or they you know flu vaccines and
A	they try and put yeah they do pregnant women don't they?
B	it's you're talking multi-billion probably multi-trillion
A	yep that the government's pay for and are in on mm
B	well
A	it's just weird circulation of money isn't it?
B	who's got more power? these people making multi-trillion
A	yeah
B	pound profits? or some guy with dusty shoulders and a cabinet of?
A	dusty shoulders?
B	I dunno
A	dusty shoulders? why dusty shoulders? cos he isn't because his suit is so old what do you mean? er
B	you know it seemed like quite a good metaphor to use
A	he's got dusty shoulders
B	but I reckon they're they're gonna do another campaign now on the back of this er Ebola thing
A	yeah Ebola they're all talking about it
B	you know they've stirred up fear again in people
B	people are worried about it we've had bloody emails at work about it
A	yeah
B	no I mean this is the kind of thing these PR people do they
A	do you remember when you asked when they had the flu vaccine and you asked for er a poster?
B	yeah I got like
A	they sent it to you?
B	yeah I've got loads of them
A	so can't you ask for a poster this time?
B	what for the Ebola?
A	Ebola posters
B	yeah?
A	yeah go on
B	the thing is now though you can just get them off erm
A	really interesting
B	tut you can just get them off Google Images
A	yeah
B	I mean I didn't get the real posters which is what I wanted but I just got he sent me the er JPEGs
A	oh did he?
B	yeah it was some doctor cos I said I was writing a PhD on on the posters of the flu vaccine
A	I'd like to do that
B	yeah
A	oh I'd like to do that
B	erm yeah I dunno where they are
A	didn't you print em out? I thought came back with
B	no no
A	you got the JPEGs? they'll be on the old hard drive won't they?
B	no I think I don't think I've saved them I think they're just in the email
A	are you alright? it's okay you can play with the box just don't eat it she loves this box
B	mm yeah I reckon the back of this Ebola thing there erm there's gonna be another kind of swine virus type thing
A	yeah yeah there will be
B	coming in people have already got that fear
B	what?
A	tried it erm Ebola thing but
B	oh I don't know if er I don't think it'd be Ebola it'd be something else
A	oh careful now erm but they said what? didn't they say at the beginning that they didn't have a vaccine for it and it would take years to get one? and then suddenly they've got one
B	oh really?
A	yeah that they want to trial
B	but people wouldn't take it not unless there was a perceived risk of actually contracting it
A	mm
B	and I don't think that perceived risk is high enough in the UK
A	yeah we'll they're trying to make it high enough
B	well I I dunno
A	yeah
B	it'd need an outbreak in the UK first or they need at least kind of half a dozen people that'd be enough
A	half a dozen people with an outbreak?
B	well it would be for the media
A	okay
B	I was reading about that it's not even that dangerous Ebola well it is
A	well it is it it is but erm if you're healthy
B	but it if erm yeah it said if you get medical good medical attention you'll be fine if you don't have any treatment at all you've got a fifty-fifty chance I've always thought that if you got it in any kind of way shape or form you're screwed
A	yeah I thought so too well you well look at the outbreak I mean it is
B	well it happened look where it happens it's in very poor areas where they've got no medical treatment
A	I'm really thirsty do you think you can grab me some water or something?
B	yeah yeah so this book I'm gonna get back into this shit again
A	mm
A	it's really interesting reading like talking to you about it
B	I needed I needed some time off because it does make you
A	no
B	cos it
A	oi
B	it sends you round the twist
A	don't do that she's eating the cardboard
B	I'm I'm ready again
A	that's good cos I missed you teaching me
B	well we'd have to go what time does it close?
A	we should go soon because she's gonna
B	what time does it close?
A	er it's open all evening
B	is it?
A	mm I know people who have been in the evenings after work

A	but you know what I mean it's
B	it's it's a long way
A	cos if you don't yeah it's a long way
B	it's a long way to go just for a couple of beers as well if I just wanted to go quickly
A	yeah
B	and show my face
A	yeah mm but it is possible like twenty minute taxi ride and then you can get back in a taxi but it's just that you like to stay late once you're there
B	yeah well I know that's my problem
A	how about if I phone you at twelve and say get back home
A	I could do if you want me to

B	and if they get completely hammered then they might not even turn up tomorrow
A	yeah well they probably want practice tonight and tomorrow
B	and we've got
A	all I'm saying is if like
B	two gigs coming up so
A	they're starting yeah if these gigs are coming up and if you start no we're not going to go and play in the band
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about gigs	Entailment
B	mm mm
A	then they'll find someone else
B	yeah the thing is I
A	and you'll just be the Sunday night guy
B	yeah
A	which is what you were last term and you weren't happy about it
B	yeah
A	you wanted to have more didn't you?
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about weather	Contradiction
B	yeah I do want more I know I know they want me
A	mm
B	so it's it's difficult with you isn't it?
A	yeah I know but it won't be all the time will it? it's only cos it's a one-off house party and
B	yeah
A	because we've all come back
B	but I think I could bring quite a lot to the band in terms of expanding them
A	mm
B	with ideas
A	yeah
B	erm because we're the only foreign band in this city
A	yeah
B	like western foreign band there's Filipino bands and stuff but this what eight million people in this city?
A	yeah
B	do you know what I mean? that's we're we're playing at a wedding or something erm in a couple of weeks
A	that'd be brilliant to do weddings because
B	well it's I mean they're not giving us
A	total?
B	yeah
A	so fifty quid each or something
B	well yeah about sixty-seventy quid each yeah
A	mm
B	erm
A	yeah
B	so
A	you can't have a band for a wedding for twenty minutes
B	if we had like one and a half hour
A	well
B	slot you know and then we could get probably double that
A	yeah
B	easy
A	yeah it's massive everybody will be hiring you for their weddings
B	and it's not just
A	mm
B	there's a lot of money some here in between
A	mm
B	that whole kind of belt
A	yeah
A	but all I'm saying is like I know I really need your help tomorrow
B	mm
A	so yeah I don't want you to get pissed either because
B	yeah
A	it'll be cos I'm so tired that we're gonna have er yeah we're gonna need you tomorrow
B	yeah
A	but I think you need to go to any band practice they've got right now
B	yeah
A	I don't mind you going at all I I really don't mind you going but I do need you tomorrow
B	yeah well maybe I can go just for a few hours
A	mm
B	I need one of those like belt those tags like criminals
B	erm what else was I gonna say? er oh yeah and as I think because I play the
A	yeah mm
B	it's such a novelty for them they absolutely love it
A	yeah
B	and I think I don't know the best way to publicise ourselves but I was getting ideas from that book I was reading cos Bernays was talking about how it should be a it is a staged event but it should never appear as a staged event as a whole
A	mm
B	it's one of the first points right I was thinking what we could do you know to give a massive impact
A	mm mm
B	but without making it look appear staged
A	okay
B	but by something we do
A	erm well it's playing the
B	yeah he said there's TV radio
A	yeah
B	and yeah but I I don't think that'll work just
A	yeah that that's the advertising
B	yeah
A	and if you can negotiate not to do it every two weeks to do it to do it every once a month gig
B	mm
A	that will be perfect
B	yeah
A	yeah with the advertising as well it's great
B	mm yeah
A	and then once people how about erm people need to start putting you through reach out basically
B	well they they do reach out
A	who?
B	the band
A	no no no somebody needs to record you post it on we chat for people to erm to you you know how when you were at uni once one of the lecturers said oh wow you've been on Wechat your face has been on Wechat a lot that was because some students what did they do? they took a picture of you
B	yeah
A	passed it on to somebody else who passed it on to somebody else who passed it on to somebody else share a video share a link share a link share a link share a link and it goes round I mean it'll be surprising it'll go round quite rapidly
B	so maybe if we could just do yeah a video somewhere
A	you need a video and you need someone like me to I'll share it with
B	and try and make it go viral
A	yeah
B	er locally viral
A	yeah yeah yeah that's what I mean yeah not not like on the internet viral but
B	yeah
A	if you do the Wechat then it's all of this community isn't it basically
B	yeah
A	everybody who's found it so but you don't want to tell people to repost it so you just make sure you you show it to lots of people
B	yeah that would get the name recognised but
A	what's the name of your band? have you got a name?
B	it's
B	yeah
A	why?
A	oh
B	but
A	and a lot of his songs are about the girl
B	a lot of his songs are about girls
A	that's not yeah that's not too
B	yeah that's yeah I'm not happy with the name well it depends how big they wanna get
A	you can always change the name later
B	cos I think we could get pretty good to be honest
A	mm yeah there is I agree
B	like
A	mm
B	apart from people who are mega famous
A	yeah
A	mm
B	erm but
A	can't
B	but he's been saying that for a few months
A	can't
B	no
A	can't be that hard can it?
B	no he sings
A	if he plays guitar already
B	no he plays acoustic he's a folk singer
A	oh you can be in two bands can't you? but that's too much hard work
B	mm
A	and
B	yeah
A	yeah it's
B	this year
B	and I wanna yeah I wanna get back on the propaganda stuff as well
A	no more stupid
B	no no no no no
A	an absolute waste of time
B	yeah agreed
A	oh man I can't believe some of the shit we've watched
B	yeah
A	lately I know we needed it cos we needed a break and we were always tired and
B	but occasionally
A	yeah but as soon as we start one series thing I don't know then we just sit down at dinner we watch another series and then every dinner time it's the same
B	yeah yeah it's a waste of time
A	and then we get tired after dinner and we're like oh shall we watch
B	really?
A	yeah
B	oh
A	do you really?
B	oh oh oh
B	you're funny aren't you?
A	ah ah ah
B	mm sorry I still haven't made this drink do you want to hold it while I get a drink
A	yeah just
A	yeah I could do with some camomile tea just
B	do you want me to reheat the kettle or
A	no no no I don't want it too hot
B	well I'm going to have pineapple juice

A	and not reliable yeah
B	that aren't they
A	who doesn't turn up to half of the stuff
B	who's always too tired he can never really come to things
A	yeah
B	erm which is the case
A	yeah
A	it'll be alright once you get there
B	yeah
A	bit
B	I was thinking a lot of this depends on me er becoming a bit more self-disciplined with leaving early rather than being the last one to leave
A	yeah yeah
B	that's if I if I'm gonna make this work that's what I need to change
A	yeah agreed I agree
B	cos I can't be having
A	you can't do everything
B	no I can't I know that cos it would ruin tomorrow as well
A	and yeah and during the day well she's up isn't she? she's up at six so
