B	but the frames were slightly different
C	it was fifty-five pounds before we had the
B	okay

B	yeah
C	right um
D	yeah cos it's the little holes that make it isn't it?
C	yeah
B	mm
C	otherwise it wouldn't be anything
B	it's amazing isn't it?
D	yeah
C	so you reckon this one eighty pounds? Mum?
B	yes I think so
C	is that enough to give you a cut and to give the gallery a cut and to give us
B	we don't want a cut
C	yeah you do
B	well you can pay for the frame
D	yeah
B	it's about fourteen pound for the frame

B	mm
C	yeah definitely pay for the frame and a little bit for you
D	yeah
B	yeah it's not a yeah but I don't know how
C	not a lot is it?
B	I think we take their advice as well because
D	yeah
B	they might have a totally different idea to us anyway
D	yeah
B	mightn't they?
C	yeah
D	right well how much was the frame? Seventeen pounds
B	I think they were about fourteen the frames of those
D	fourteen?
A	yeah
B	they were thirteen ninety-nine
D	and how much were the prints?
B	erm the print
C	and then the card
D	and the card
A	and the putting them in
D	and putting them in
C	yeah
A	and cutting it all
D	and cutting it all
C	yeah well we'll pay you for that
A	oh no
C	no well I think you should
D	no but that should be all in the cost shouldn't it
C	that should be in the cost
A	oh I see
C	could you get me a knife?
D	you've gotta put the hours of labour into it as well
C	oh I'll get it
A	yeah but I mean that isn't too bad once we've once we knew how to do it that was quite easy actually
D	yeah?
A	that's cos we've bought all the cutters and everything
C	La
A	let me get you a better knife than that cos that's a butter knife that'll that'll snap
C	oh
B	the actual print is well six-fifty plus erm two ninety-nine postage
C	so ten pounds for the print okay
D	and fourteen
C	that's twenty-five pounds and then the paper
D	yeah
B	mm
C	thirty something pounds to produce
B	mm
C	thank you
B	seventy for the smaller ones
C	seventy for the smaller
B	I don't think it's much much different really is it now?
A	no
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	well the frames are slightly cheaper that's all really
A	yeah
B	mm
D	why are you taking that out?
C	I want to write one of ten on the back cos apparently before you
D	yeah
C	oh
A	what's the matter
C	no it's alright I'll just do this
A	are we having a cup of tea before you go?
B	yeah
C	yes yes please
A	I'll put the kettle on then
B	mm
C	well this is exciting innit mum? We're sort of like real artists for the day
B	I know it is
C	we we were saying though we could
B	I've got this awful feeling we'll come back thinking oh
C	we could turn up and they say oh well we haven't got time today to look at them
D	yeah the tiger's brilliant
C	yeah?
B	I don't like it now I've looked at it again
D	that's amazing that is
B	oh
C	all the more reason to sell it then
B	yes it is
C	whereas Polperro you want to keep forever don't you?
B	I do quite like Polperro
C	huh?
B	I do quite like Polperro
C	yeah
D	yeah
B	but I I'm quite I'm happy for anything to go now really
D	yeah well it's better than
B	Cos I think I'm progressing on now like once I start again
C	yeah
C	well we don't have to worry about the danger of popping it now
B	no we don't
D	okay so what are we calling them? What are we calling that one? Darjeeling?
C	can you write it all down for me?
D	calling that one The Space Between
B	but I think that I think they will say they want they would sell it more than seventy
D	yeah
B	Cos they if they want their thirty percent they would the higher the price the more the money they get don't they?
D	yeah
C	you were right
B	yeah?
C	yeah yeah say
B	it's true isn't it?
C	yeah
B	well I think that the paperwork would do for twenty pound
D	yeah
C	well they asked us for for approximate costs for them
D	oh did they?
C	yeah
D	hmm
C	erm
D	well as long as you know how much it cost to produce them then
C	well that's what I need to write down
D	yeah
C	I I can't remember
D	Cos there's no point  there's no point  driving all that way for like a fiver profit
C	no
D	yeah exactly
A	you what?
C	that's the thing you don't realise do you how much
D	it's quite difficult selling art isn't it
C	yeah you don't realise how
A	yeah
C	well actually we haven't put very much work in
D	like cos your mum's embroidery like how many hours did she take?
C	that's not embroidery that's textile art
D	well textiles
C	well there's maybe some embroidery I don't know
D	well it's textiles yeah
C	look at that cos it's coming right off the page look
D	yeah but how many hours?
C	I know that's why we we're selling that for five five-ninety
D	do you know what I mean you
C	no they don't they just look
D	like even if you think minimum wage
C	yeah
D	you know a hundred hours probably
C	I've lost my vinegar
D	A hundred hours at minimum wage is like six hundred quid
C	because because it's like a hobby she forgets how long she's spent on it so she can
D	yeah
C	and cos they've always been used to having
D	what?
C	I'm gonna have to open it
D	what are we calling this one?
C	I don't know but look at  look at  that damage there
D	oh is that inside?
C	yeah
D	erm
C	this one's called Hampi no?
D	if we call it Hampi though that doesn't mean anything to anyone does it?
