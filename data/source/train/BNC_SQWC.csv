C	yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	Cos I did it on purpose to see if it would evoke him
C	mm
A	like to to do something
C	mm
A	I wouldn't have questioned it
C	yeah
unknown_female	yo

C	yeah
A	yeah
C	that's just he's just not  on you at all
A	yeah
unknown_female	woo woo
A	if you're not if I'm not gonna hit any type of priority when I could've been killed
C	mm
A	then really that just shows you
C	fuck
A	I said to
C	mm
A	I said it it's just a stark example of the person that he's turned into
C	mm
A	Cos the
C	yeah
A	the fact that that he's getting information like that and doesn't see it as being important
C	Cos er that's er
A	it's just
C	it's it's anybody
A	yeah
C	know
A	yeah
C	you'd be holy shit
A	you know
C	yeah
A	that's exactly what he's thought
C	well I can't come and see you because obviously for the next forty-eight hours I can't leave her side
C	mm
unknown_female	are you alright for juice
A	if I'd have heard that I would've
C	mm
A	said to him
unknown_female	that's fine
A	look I'm gonna have to do this
unknown_female	oh you've got them?
C	mm
A	do you wanna?
C	oh er clearly
A	do you wanna put a film on or something? I'll be back in an hour and a half
C	yeah
unknown_female	uh
C	yeah
A	or do you mind if I just make a phone call? Like even if it was just a phone call
C	mm
A	to call me
C	mm
A	are you sure you're okay? Not even a phone call
C	nothing
A	no
C	weird
A	yeah
C	it's very strange
unknown_female	oh really?
unknown_female	yeah
A	and mental as that may be for someone that you don't really know
C	no
A	very much
A	she says if I were you I'd just write him out write him off
C	this is what I keep saying
A	mm
C	I just think
unknown_female	you're playing it cool but playing it
C	every every time
C	everyday he just
unknown_female	nah
C	makes the situation worse
A	yeah
C	that he lets you down
unknown_female	yeah true
C	it's a blow
unknown_female	and she says this
A	yeah
unknown_female	she says it's not
C	and there's only so much that you can cope with
unknown_female	mm
C	like you're already like if you feel shit like this weekend you feel shit you don't wanna be reminded
C	that he's acting like a tool at the same time
A	yeah
C	you know
A	yeah
C	but it's easier it's I do appreciate it's easier said than done
unknown_female	yeah
C	but
unknown_female	no?
unknown_female	no
A	I said to
A	hurt since I've been apart from him
unknown_female	yeah
C	mm
unknown_female	mm
A	like and seriously
C	mm
A	and that he wasn't there to look after me
A	or run a bath or
C	mm
A	just tell me it's gonna be alright
C	well it's not until like something like that happens that you realize how like
C	how different he is now with you
A	yeah
A	want to be around him
C	well no
A	yeah
C	isn't he
A	really selfish
C	mm
unknown_female	I suppose
A	I mean I always knew he was selfish
A	and I used to tell his mum he was selfish
C	mm
A	I never thought he would
C	I mean you were saying that you know with his other friends he's been cutting them out
C	check that they're okay
A	no
C	really?
A	that's it
unknown_female	yeah
A	he was trying to say to me when we were in
unknown_female	almost
A	because of how crap he is at life and he cuts them out and doesn't really talk to them
C	they don't even bother to
unknown_female	well no it is
A	yeah
C	you'd be gutted
C	like if you like with
A	mm
C	she doesn't talk about her problem
C	because she thinks it's really boring
unknown_female	I can't remember
C	I didn't even realize that she'd
C	she didn't call me
unknown_female	not
C	because you think
A	yeah
C	oh my God you feel like you can't come and talk to me
C	and it's it's not alright it's because she can't she doesn't want to burden people with her problems
unknown_female	oh
C	even someone like me and we're really close
B	mm?
A	can you close the door to please? Thanks dear
A	it's making me feel a bit sick
C	yeah
unknown_female	no that bit's great
C	it's hard
A	yeah
C	you know if he's got if you feel like you're a bad friend do something about it
A	that's he was saying when we were in London
C	er
A	actual by actual fact he shouldn't have bothered saying that cos he didn't want to do anything about it
C	yes
A	care for sure
C	like it's not he's just it's almost sort of like he's pointing out that that's the problem but he's there's no culpability there
A	yeah
C	accepting that it's his
A	yeah
C	er or plan to do anything about it
A	I think yeah I mean I just realized it's he realizes it's his fault
C	mm
A	I mean er to be honest I don't really want him to come round
C	mm
A	Cos I know what's gonna happen
C	I don't think seeing him is a good idea
A	yeah
C	and the last time before that you saw him face to face when was that? Um my point is did you are you arguing every time you're seeing each other? I think
A	no
C	no? Are you sure?
A	no
C	Cos seems like every time you see him there's some sort of he lets you down or there's a problem or you know
A	yeah
C	Cos there was The Comedy Club
A	oh yeah
C	and that was a bit of a problem
A	yeah it was
A	no thank you
C	tea? No?
A	just a guilty pleasure ain't it
C	yeah
A	but I know I don't actually want to see him
C	oh well no
A	yeah
C	but you've gotta think of it as self-preservation
A	I'm gonna text him and say do you know what don't bother  don't bother  coming round tomorrow
C	mm
A	not Monday four days later
C	mm
C	yeah
B	mm?
C	because it doesn't
A	no
C	you know
C	I had this with a friend of mine at uni
A	no
C	and I'm like that's the most retarded thing I've
A	yeah
C	ever heard in my life
B	yeah
C	I don't think that's true at all
A	no
C	it takes constant all relationships take work and effort on
A	yeah
C	both parts
A	well it's a friendship
C	yeah
C	exactly
C	exactly
A	course it does
C	yeah
A	that's what happens
C	absolutely
C	speaking of I'm starting to feel quite guilty for not going out last night with for
A	oh yeah
C	she didn't replied
C	oh you could've let me know sooner
A	mm
C	I think well
A	I don't know
C	yeah
A	seriously
C	I mean I had to chase her for the plans
C	and I think
unknown_female	yeah
C	if there'd been a well this is what we're doing not like military precision but you know
A	no
C	this is what I want to do
C	it would've been different
A	yeah
C	but I still do feel a bit guilty
A	I'd be sitting on selfish street for this one
C	yeah
C	I mean no one wants to think of themselves as a bad friend but it doesn't seem to bother
A	no
A	it really doesn't
B	one two three
A	the more I think about it
A	you're right
C	well the thing is er if you woke up tomorrow morning and think oh do you know what? I probably do wanna see him
A	like just seeing his face is gonna anger me
C	yep
A	he's gonna make my blood boil
C	it's gonna end in a  in a  argument
A	yeah
C	at this point
unknown_female	I think it was
C	how much more can your heart take? Er cos the constant blow every time it lets you down
A	yeah
C	well doesn't seem like it
A	no
C	so no I would say he's not gonna be one
A	huh
C	at least er but the more that you recognize it the more that you see it
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	The recognition is scalable.	Entailment
C	it's gonna get easier
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	I don't need you four days later
C	well
B	I think
A	which is true
unknown_female	oh
C	I mean it's totally up to you
B	it's one of the same
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B is good at recognition tasks.	Neutral
C	I mean you can either you know say that as a way of making a point
B	yeah
C	or just say look
C	just don't come round I've you know
A	mm
C	Cos obviously if you start down that road he's gonna come back with something
C	and that's gonna open communication channels
unknown_female	yeah sort of
C	so it's whether you wanna sort of engage in that
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	All that matters is the level of engagement when it comes to conversation according to speaker C.	Entailment
unknown_female	mm
A	I think if he replied after that I just wouldn't reply
unknown_female	right
A	I know what's gonna happen
A	either he comes here and I'm gonna lay into him
B	it's so much easier to use than my text messaging
unknown_female	yeah
A	I'm gonna
[ANNOTATION]	Texting is not really convenient for speaker B.	Entailment
C	yeah
A	he's not yeah he's just he's he's not taking it on board
C	mm
A	come to that conclusion himself
C	yeah
unknown_female	did I tell you
A	and really I think we both know it's not gonna make any difference whether he receives that message or not
A	to him
[ANNOTATION]	The message concerns work issues.	Neutral
C	yeah
A	but it'll make me feel a bit better that I've had a little dig
C	yeah
unknown_female	if I had
C	well then
unknown_female	I would spend sixty-five
[ANNOTATION]	The female would not use more than 70.	Entailment
C	there you go
B	really?
C	sounds like a good idea
C	Cos it's it's so hard when you rely on a person like that and they let you down every time
B	well
unknown_female	if it was free delivery I would've donated a lot higher
B	yeah
B	well most of that
C	huh
unknown_female	goes to the
unknown_female	charity anyway
C	my tummy hurts man
A	urgh
C	how are you feeling?
A	just shakey
C	shakey?
A	yeah
C	oh
A	I just feel a bit hollow
C	oh huh
A	I took a photograph of my injuries again
C	oh huh
A	yeah
A	go go go
C	I've gotta find that charger
A	I've had one every day now
C	A photo?
A	done a photo every day for that yep
C	I think we'll have to put the photos on my laptop with me

B	she got a little bit
C	are you?
B	upset
A	yeah
B	you know when you were cutting your
A	oh no
B	she was cutting your hair?
unknown_female	yeah
A	I only managed two
B	and you kept looking at me when she was talking about
C	that's weird isn't it
B	well she was throwing hints in about babies
C	Cos of course
unknown_female	mm
C	you had the cheeseburger
C	and then you had a lie down
B	yeah you were
C	maybe you need to sleep every time you eat
B	Cos I know you know but I told you not to sort of say anything
A	maybe I need to sleep it off
unknown_female	yeah
C	or or at least yeah
B	oh yeah
C	whether it's um sitting up or
A	maybe I need to put a film on
B	I told her that you knew
C	yeah
unknown_female	yeah
B	something
A	maybe I need to put a Spanish film on
unknown_female	but not all of it
A	yeah
unknown_female	I said there's a possibility
C	they are a bit weird
unknown_female	that we could be pregnant
A	with the
C	yeah
C	unless I've remembered it wrong
B	I said don't worry I won't say anything else
C	I think it is that one
B	until we know for sure
C	yeah it might be nice to veg out
B	and come the weekend hopefully we'll know and we'll start spreading the word
A	just gonna ask
C	mm
unknown_female	yeah
B	get everyone excited and then something bad goes wrong

B	you know
A	I'm going back to bed now

unknown_female	I don't care if you come in a wheelchair

B	I'll get you a mobility scooter
A	do you think I could get a mobility scooter then?

unknown_female	yeah
B	if you went to the
