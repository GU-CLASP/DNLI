B	yeah
D	mm bath something bath?
A	four five six seven eight nine

A	bathing
B	it's the same
unknown_female	mm
B	it actually means two different things
E	it means different things doesn't it?
A	yeah yeah
E	and it's just the way you say it
E	it wouldn't would it? no terrible
B	so your research isn't very good then?
A	no it's shit
A	but it pays me
E	is that is that being recorded?
E	you've gotta be careful what you say
A	it's so embarrassing so someone at work who's recording for us but she's slagging everyone else off and it
E	but she knows she's being recorded when she
A	no she's the recording so there's no you know
E	oh
A	it's like you're an absolute unprofessional idiot
E	oh dear
B	I just
A	it's all anonymous
E	as long as you're not recording this that's fine
A	yeah like just
E	mm
A	say you're agreeing to
E	and do you have to be over the age of whatever?
A	no you can
E	cos
A	you you could erm you could
E	oh no problem
A	and then it's all anonymised and you get
E	eighteen pounds an hour?
A	and you up to five hundred quid
E	and then talk for an hour
D	wow
E	so we could actually get
A	you could do five hundred and you could do five
E	you could fund your trip to
D	well if I if I told them that I'm sure they'd earn the money
E	chat
D	and spend it on something they want
A	but you could all do it for five hundred like
E	yeah yeah to help fund our skiing trip
D	uhu
E	bit late but you know
E	in retrospect
A	yeah it's good money I think it's really good money
E	it is there's a catch
D	oh this is pathetic I think
A	no there's er there's no catch I promise you it's it's it's like university of
E	well we can get all of
D	yeah
A	honestly if you've got Scots the Celtic fringe we're having
D	this is how you spell heaven isn't it?
B	heaven
E	and
A	we're having erm a
D	how pathetic
A	real problem with the Celtic fringe so
B	how many?
D	er I will have four
E	well he's got a brother in law who's Scottish and a sister who lives in
A	honestly we'd
C	lives in
A	we'd love we'd love them to be in it
D	sorry?
D	yeah
E	they'll get
D	yeah I'm sure they'd sign up
A	otherwise I've got to go up to Scotland and make recordings of randomers and I don't wanna do that
B	why Scotland?
A	I'm gonna be sent in a van
E	what about Newcastle will that do?
A	yeah Newcastle
B	why
A	yeah
C	or
D	thing is
E	well
D	the north
A	no it
D	uhu
A	we were a bit worried when
B	W E A R I could do I suppose W
D	where?
B	E A R
D	is bath a word? oh bathe doh
B	where?
E	it sounds a bit random researching I
E	so how many people do you need? I mean
A	er
E	or
A	we're collecting ten million words
E	mm
A	of spoken English
E	oh okay
A	and we're up to eight and a half so we're doing well
E	doing well eight and a half million?
A	yeah
A	and that's like eight hundred hours of chats
B	four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen eighteen twenty-three
E	so ideally we'd just read out the dictionary to you? that's not allowed
A	no no
E	but that would help
D	well done
B	why did you not put bathtime in the end
D	I didn't have a T or an M
B	oh
C	details
D	apart from that I would have done
B	yeah
D	I think I tried but

B	it's a shame you can't fit I M P in there
D	implode I was thinking of plodge but it doesn't
E	plunge
D	I'm not sure anything can work really can it? alode? elode?
B	don't think so B
D	blode?
B	there might be
D	B B L O D E maybe?
