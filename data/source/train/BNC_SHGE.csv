B	mm
A	well
C	I don't know I can't remember

C	I can't remember where it is
A	I can't see it getting into
C	no no
A	well if you go get going on road to

A	there's nursery there er
C	yes yeah
A	opposite really
C	somebody had been there and said it was quite good the meal there
A	er well I think it's not so bad
C	the
A	yeah

A	I got sirens going now
B	mm

B	mm
A	yeah
B	they're all over the place
C	I hope we don't get lights going off again they've only just
A	aye
C	got back to normal
A	well if the
C	they said there isn't a warning for this area yet
A	not yet no
C	on the er
A	if
C	mm
A	that is
C	you were alright though weren't you?
B	mm
A	we were alright it's a civilised place you see is
C	I was surprised though that you didn't get it
B	I know
A	our electric's
B	everywhere else did
A	funny in
C	well
A	yeah
C	and yet up there up
A	yeah
C	up the little cul de sac
A	yeah
C	they must be on a different one because theirs'll or one side of the road
A	yeah
C	theirs'll be off er and mine'll be on or vice versa
B	mm
A	mm well that's how it goes isn't it?
C	mm mm
A	so no we never got er well er we did get a we did get a little blip didn't we? because the tellies went off
B	oh yeah only
B	very briefly though
C	yeah
A	but it did enough to turn the telly off and then it takes three days before it comes back on again
C	why's that?
A	I don't know there's a component
A	it's a fault
C	yes
A	at repairs
C	yeah
A	and er oh he said I know what that is he said it's er a little component in the back he said it's a faulty component and
C	and yours comes into that?
A	but he said we can put another component in er I think he said it would be seventy quid or something like that because he said he has to take the screen out to get into the
C	back
A	where the component is
B	mm
A	so that was
C	yeah
A	and then take the thing
B	you'd think Panasonic would fix it though
B	yeah
C	yes yeah
C	that's what they do with the cars
A	that's what they should have done but obviously they don't
C	mm
A	want to do they? the cost but he said that that's what it is he said I know what it is I know exactly what it is but he couldn't really understand
C	mm
A	in the
B	mm
A	set and it takes about three days don't it?
C	which is
B	mm
C	awkward isn't it?
A	well it is if you've only one telly
C	yeah
B	mm
C	oh
A	all the time
C	oh oh
A	it's a strange thing
C	funny thing
A	yeah it's a strange
B	mm
A	carry on
C	never heard of that
A	and it's works perfectly alright when it's
C	when it's
A	yeah
C	when it's on
A	perfectly alright
C	or if it's running alright yeah
A	nothing wrong with it you wouldn't think there was anything wrong with it
C	no
A	so we've resisted repairing them
A	and we just put up with it
A	right you've no telly now for three days
C	mm
A	which we hadn't
C	and is this while you've had your visitors?

B	mm
A	it was good one
C	was it a frozen one? or a fresh?
B	no it was fresh
C	it was fresh
A	it was a good one
C	yeah
A	cos it there were six of us and there was enough seven of us and we still had a a lot left
C	some
A	I think
B	mm
A	I think
C	yeah
A	we we seven of us I think and kids like their meat don't they?
C	do they?
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	mm
C	mm oh good
A	so it was very good that goose yeah it was a good one cos normally we haven't that sort of meat we you know it's a massive big frame with that
B	well it's
A	but she'd also cooked another bird but we never touched it you see
C	yeah so if you got that today
A	but somebody in their infinite wisdom has turned the switches off our fridge
C	oh who would?
A	well nobody's owning up to it
B	mm
A	but there's one particular person who's a very thorough cleaner and we have our suspicions that that's what's happened
C	oh
A	so the fridge has gone off
C	oh dear
B	mm
A	so now it's on full charge but hopefully we haven't ruined everything in it
C	yeah well you see mine went off when we had that cut
A	yeah
C	in the electricity they say if you keep fridge
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	er that it's alright
A	well hopefully it is otherwise I'll
C	so I kept my freezer door shut
C	but I had to open the top you have to open the top to get in the
A	we'll have bad stomachs again if not
A	it's just your head isn't it?
C	yeah
C	my legs
A	what you were off your legs with it
C	no I was bad on my legs yesterday morning
C	I didn't feel before I went out
A	your legs
C	yeah I didn't feel so good on my
A	if you stop your legs
A	there might not be anything wrong with your legs if you stop the drinking
C	that was before I'd had anything at all
A	ah we
C	I think I had a a couple of coffees
A	I had a look in that in that bottle box and there ain't half some bottles of whisky empty bottles of whisky in there I'm wondering if your legs are perfectly alright
C	I've got some whisky in there
C	I've got some whisky bought yesterday
A	yeah

A	oh right
C	Croft sherry
A	oh that'll be nice
C	yeah
B	mm
C	mm
A	well very good
A	well if you can't have a little tipple at Christmas it's
C	well that's what I think I
A	well
C	I cut it down a bit because my blood count you know
C	the Warfarin was too thin
A	yeah
C	and I thought well I'm drinking I was having wine well you see if I open a bottle of wine I have to drink it if nobody comes I have to drink it all myself so I I don't drink it all in one day
A	well just you just have to haven't you? I mean
A	you
C	no I wouldn't
A	once you've
C	so
C	I thought I'll have to cut down because
C	I think I mean my my blood's getting too thin
C	so hopefully it'll be alright next time
A	no it doesn't really do you a lot of damage unless you're silly drinking the amount that you drink
C	well
A	yeah but you only have a tot at night don't you?
C	yeah
A	well
C	and I don't have it every night anyway
