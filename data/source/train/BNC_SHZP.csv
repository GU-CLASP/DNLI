A	right
B	mother of the bridge
A	you went you went yeah mother of the bride and you went into the back of your wardrobe
B	I went into the back of my wardrobe and I have erm a
A	are you sure you don't want a cup of tea or coffee?
B	no thank you absolutely fine
A	mm
B	erm it's going to be a Christmas wedding so it's winter it should be you know the cold side but indoors it'll be warm so I need to take a layer off to be able to be comfortable when I'm inside and I'd gone to the back of my wardrobe and twenty years ago I had this wonderful velvet Laura Ashley coat dress
A	oh right
B	so mid
A	what colour?
B	midnight blue
A	oh
B	velvet beautiful velvet covered erm buttons and satin biased down the front and it was buttoned all the way down and it was erm ankle length ballerina sort of length
A	oh
B	and I had in the back of my mind that
A	can't you have it altered?
B	I might do no I I don't think you can do anything with it so I'm looking for a new outfit so I've decided erm
A	and what length?
B	erm just below the knee
A	that's sounds really good
B	mm
A	so where have you looked so far?
B	erm online I haven't gone to the shops yet I just thought I'd see what's online erm
A	oh
B	and it
A	it's a nightmare to to go and choose something though
B	it is yeah
A	I I I really don't want to have to do it ever again
B	er and I I think it's because we have so much time to think about it
C	mm
B	you know if if I were going just a few weeks before to get a dress and had to fixate on something then I would do so
A	but the other thing is that stuff that I looked at originally that I thought might be quite nice
B	mm
A	I then found when I was looking again having made the mistake and having to buy one in
B	yes yeah
A	I I and and on the internet for fifty quid
B	yes and I'm going to be the wrong side of that
A	yeah
B	and not Christmas and I have to buy the wedding is on the twentieth

B	I mean if you came undressed that would be noticed but er
B	you know other than that
C	or a pair of swimming shorts or something
B	you know I mean dress down I would say
C	yeah yeah
B	that would be noticed but this is just going to be an evening wedding because

A	mm
B	yeah yeah and er but but mainly about the erm the TV and er

C	mm
B	and er you know the fact that my mother at ninety

C	I suppose it saves you reading them doesn't it? I I think that it's a difficult read

C	Game of Thrones cos there are so many characters in it
A	mm
C	so it's quite tricky to keep up
B	yeah
C	no
B	I go to bed and I try to read and I'm asleep

A	well it's it's such a beautiful setting up there to
B	it is yeah I think
A	oh no this is with
B	no oh this is
A	no we're
B	no
A	I know this summer when they do the plays
B	that
A	they have they light up the trees
B	they do
A	do they do that
B	er
A	in winter as well?
B	no because that's a lighting company that comes and
A	oh
B	does it so we will be doing that in fact that's one of the questions I wanted to ask you was I saw those big halogen lights
A	oh yeah they came with the marquee
B	they came with the marquee did they?
A	mm
B	okay
A	they put them up there
B	yeah yeah so
A	cos he's originally put blue lights there and she didn't like them
B	oh
B	and so what are they the white
A	and she said to me no I don't like them
C	mm
B	yeah
A	like behave as badly as you want and demand all sorts of things
A	she said can I? yeah and I
B	yes
A	did I say they were green?
B	no you said they were blue
A	or blue? no they were green and she didn't like them
B	right
C	ah
B	okay
A	so he put blue and they tested them out
B	yeah
A	and it was quite pretty cos they were silver birch
B	and it was it was yes it was
A	that that shines
C	yes it made them white
B	it was silvery blue
A	yeah it looked white
B	it was lovely it was midnight it was midnight moon moon colour wasn't it?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	it came out quite well
B	yeah so
A	no those lights came
B	yeah
A	they they
B	well for
A	oh
C	oh
A	gosh
B	it's sitting in the
A	mm
B	and the trees are huge and they
A	mm
B	they're coming over
A	mm
C	oh
B	so if those were all lit up
A	oh gosh
B	you know it it should actually come through nicely
C	mm
A	can you actually get
B	yes but more expensive
A	you can?
B	yes he's found one
A	oh really?
B	yeah yeah
A	oh wow that'll be brilliant
B	and you know normally you wouldn't go for that because on a really sunny day you'd just be sweltering inside
A	mm
B	and the temperature on Saturday was lovely wasn't it?
C	it it was just right actually
B	it was we we in fact
C	yeah
B	we talked about it
C	yeah the temperature was
A	mm
C	just right
B	yeah
C	wasn't it it was just
A	mm
C	perfect
B	so normally if you have a clear roof
C	even outside it was wasn't it?
B	the sun would just make it but
A	mm
B	at that time of year fifth of September and you know
A	December
B	shrouded by the
A	oh fifth of
B	no this is for the
A	oh I'm getting so confused between your two weddings
B	I know I know that's because they're so close together and I'm having a bit of both erm
A	you must get confused don't you?
B	well both girls are talking about the
A	well
B	both partners or couples
A	mm
B	are talking about the weddings you know their own weddings so I'm sort of cleverly switching to one to the other
C	oh that's good
A	oh right
B	so the long vases with the oasis and fruits and greenery would actually look quite nice
C	mm
A	mm
C	mm
B	so that's what I'm thinking
A	so what kind of food will that involve if it's market food?
B	erm it'll be a hog roast
A	who does that
C	mm
B	but say four or five of them where you'd have the baskets of bread
C	mm
B	you know all types of bread
C	mm
B	the next one salads and the next one
A	mm I'm a bit my brain's a bit empty at the moment
B	mm yeah
A	I've erm all my ideas have finished
B	but yeah I can
A	been used up
B	I can understand that
A	mm
B	yeah
A	it's very interesting though erm over the days I've been picking up erm
B	mm
A	of things that actually
B	are happening
A	happened
B	yeah yeah
A	from different perspectives
B	I'm sure mm
A	I I yesterday I went round delivering erm
B	had helped
A	volunteered their time to do the flower arranging in the church
B	oh lovely
A	and I had to go and find er extraordinary people who lived in extraordinary places
B	mm
A	to dig them out
B	take on it
A	comment to make yeah
B	oh lovely
A	and then
B	should have a book where you were writing these down so
A	I know mm erm
B	really?
A	the verge she moans she considers it hers in fact it's council land but
B	yeah
A	one of the big lorries who'd gone in with I think Biffa bins or something
B	oh
A	had gone over his
B	yes yeah
A	but I'd been aware of it and I'd been asking
B	yes
A	cos he rents that field he's
B	he does
A	retired that and rents the field for his rams
B	I spoke to the
A	oh did you?
B	yeah it was a long time ago
A	and it's interesting cos I learnt all about rams and
B	mm
A	breeding and things
B	mm
A	in amongst this whole
B	thing yeah
A	five day escapade and erm in the end the chairman of the parish council had to get very angry with this woman to stop her being so miserable and upsetting everyone in the whole village
B	really?
A	yeah
B	so she was voicing her opinions there and then at the time?
A	er and she you know
B	yes
A	he was very kind and he was putting out we had pegs with signs on to to show the way
B	yes
A	and she he put one peg on the on her verge to indicate that people should turn in left to park their cars
B	yes
A	and you know a peg doesn't make any mess on the verge
B	oh nonsense
A	and she came out
C	it's like
A	I only leant this yesterday I think
B	really?
A	or the day
B	and moved it
A	hurled no hurled it
B	oh
A	across the road
B	really?
A	mm
C	but that is so stupid I mean
B	that is so silly
A	it's like pin prick
B	it's Mr
A	yeah it is
B	and I lived with him oh
A	it is it's your
C	it it
A	ASBO man
C	yeah
B	yeah yeah
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	oh
C	but it's it's nothing was it's a pin prick
A	yeah I know she I think
B	and it's inconvenience for a short time it's not a normally used place
C	I mean it's only a day isn't it?
A	well it's not even inconvenient but anyway the erm
B	oh
A	so they went round to tell her that she should behave more appropriately or she wouldn't
B	oh
A	have any friends left in the village
B	oh
C	but she is she alone or is she
B	well good and I hope this do say something
C	married or
A	she's with a daughter and four vicious alsatians
B	oh well
A	one of which has which has already bitten erm
B	really?
A	mm
C	is that the
A	oh
B	mm
A	I haven't actually
C	cos er when the dogs barked there were
A	I'd
C	dogs that come out er of the other side er where you where you
A	mm
C	go out of the field
A	yeah it's literally opposite
C	slightly to the right
A	slightly to the right and opposite yeah
B	mm
C	oh it's there well they were I I thought they were very pale if they're alsatians they're more grey
A	oh
B	oh
A	I was told they're
C	god that's so unreasonable isn't it?
B	it is really really is
C	and I can't imagine
B	no
A	oh yeah yeah
B	and
C	yeah they are
A	mm
B	and it was really interesting cos we we started talking cos she said oh I don't really know anybody here and I said oh well you know you
B	and she's having the next the next week
C	oh
B	so we said right we must get together and I'll pass you over all my lanterns cos
C	that's very good isn't it it's quite convenient really
B	so
C	mm
B	so we'll pass them over to the
C	mm
B	who are having it in their garden
C	mm
B	so it'll just be a a a crossover
C	mm
A	and they're looking to have
B	so
