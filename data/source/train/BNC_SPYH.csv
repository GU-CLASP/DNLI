C	I've made friends with
B	oh have you?
C	that lovely old English
B	oh yeah he's still got it has he? yeah
A	ah

A	yeah
C	I said to
B	oh yeah
C	oh well that's a typical
B	but he spent some years in the army didn't he? I remember
C	did he?
B	I think so yes
A	oh right
C	mm
B	I wasn't quite sure whether he was a volunteer or whether he erm
A	mm mm
C	well they're both eighty-four now
B	are they?
C	yeah
A	that's a good age
B	yeah
C	mm
B	they're younger are they?
C	about eighty
B	yeah
C	eighty-one but you wouldn't know looking at them cos they're like
B	yeah
C	ten years younger at least
B	yeah
C	and they look ten years younger
A	mm
B	it's a totally different
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	ah right
C	and they
A	oh right wow that's unusual isn't it?
C	yes
A	yes
C	they've completely renovated their place and it's beautiful
B	immaculate
A	yeah
C	lovely views out
B	yeah
A	ah
C	sit in the windows just gorgeous
A	wow
B	yeah
A	mm
B	but the middle piece belongs to the
B	er
C	or
B	yeah
C	did they buy it?
B	yeah they they bought it yeah
C	once yeah well
B	they bought him out they were telling me yeah
C	so they're quite happy to rent it out it seems
B	are they still renting it out are they?
C	yeah
B	oh yeah
C	oh in the old the new building down there?
B	yeah down there
C	that's
B	that's right Vietnam comes up
C	and he's something to do with health and safety on ships
A	mm
B	yeah
C	and he makes a lot of money but he's talking about retiring or working from home and it hasn't happened yet
A	hm
B	I didn't know
C	she's very nice
B	yeah she seemed
C	there's a new build treated just across the field
A	ah right
C	where the school swimming pool used to be
B	yeah
A	ah
C	and it's the most fabulous home I went down there
A	really? mm
C	I was given a guided tour and I was like
A	wow
C	ah
A	is it? ah
C	er school play yard as well
B	very
A	yeah oh okay
C	erm there's quite a bit of room but it goes down
A	hm
C	as well and they'd just done the most amazing things
A	oh right
C	well I got a guided tour
B	what today?
C	and a glass of wine no about six months ago
B	oh
C	no you
B	I met her once
C	yeah
B	and then met her again the same day I think twice in a day yeah
A	hm
B	I didn't know who she was actually when she was knocking at the door cos I hadn't
C	she wanted to rent the field from you didn't she at one stage? or she was hoping you wouldn't allow building on it
B	no something like that
C	just because she's got horses
A	ah right
C	in a stable near Bristol
A	oh right that's a long way
C	and she wanted looking for some way to bring them down
A	yeah
B	that's
C	no she it's her horses
B	oh she her horses?
C	this Friday yes
B	oh
C	so she was looking for somewhere to stable them
A	yeah
C	and they also didn't want anybody building on it to ruin their views
B	yeah something like that I've heard that tale before
C	yeah
A	mm
B	did they have someone
C	no I think well last time I spoke to them they the horses were still in Bristol
B	I was gonna say I didn't know they were coming down
C	somewhere up there
B	I I know they asked if they could bring them down I said yeah if they want to bring them down it doesn't make any difference to me
C	but you'd have to fence them in of course so
B	I suppose they have to fence them in
C	but you've got the field above there haven't you?
B	yeah we have yeah
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	which is fenced in
B	yeah
C	so what have you two been doing this afternoon?
A	oh we've been busy haven't we?
B	yeah we've had lots to do
C	have you been out? have you been chatting?
A	I've been out in the garden
B	yeah we had
A	had a walk round
C	yeah?
B	we had our evening meal at the
A	yeah
C	oh right okay so you don't need to go out tonight then
A	yes
B	yeah
A	grandpa and I have taken part in a psychological experiment for
B	oh yes
A	eh er
C	did he pass?
A	well we don't know
C	oh
A	we're not allowed to know the results
C	oh okay
A	that's a bit of a problem
B	yeah
C	right
A	some programme on a phone they put lent me a smartphone for the weekend
C	right
A	or getting drunk
C	okay
A	and then it asks you again how you feel cos they're saying
C	that's probably true
A	and
C	yeah
A	just the the very anticipation is part of it so it's not just
B	yeah
A	alright I think I'll go and take a walk now
B	yeah
A	yes
B	mm
A	and then they're looking at erm
A	yes you've ruined the whole experience
C	yeah
A	activities in a week but they say if they did it
B	yeah why not?
A	on an actual programme it would take place over six weeks for example and then you'd see a doctor and you would look at before and after
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah yes
B	oh ho that's the most important part
A	which is the other good thing
B	yes
C	did you pay dad for taking part in
A	oh no I had to leave you didn't I? I had to be alone
B	oh yeah there we are you know
A	yes
C	right
B	oh no
A	yeah but it's quite good actually
B	it was quite good
A	it's true that I don't schedule time
C	yes
B	yeah
A	which is interesting yeah so then
A	just making me think of five activities
B	yeah
A	and actually put them in my diary
B	yeah
A	it's quite good
A	yeah they said anything at all so I've scheduled strolling around the garden as an event today
B	talking to myself
A	talking to myself
A	yeah that's a good activity
B	yeah yeah
A	get in an argument
B	yeah
A	actually it was quite nice just to think of it cooking one evening
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	are you still biking now then?
C	yes
A	yes still cycling
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	oh yeah
C	I know
A	yes with brakes that didn't work
A	that's not so good
C	most impressed
B	went down the hill there
A	yes
B	it oh well yeah that's right
A	almost all the way to
B	yeah
A	and then it's after that
B	tiring work yeah
A	downhill
B	yeah
A	but the downhill was the problem because the brakes didn't work
B	oh well
A	yes
A	dad's one
B	oh yeah
A	borrowed cos he's got a fold up one
B	oh one of those has he? yeah
A	yeah so they're quite good if you were taking the train
B	yeah
A	cos a lot of trains they're quite good but some of them have rules about when you can or can't take the bike
B	yeah
C	yeah cos
B	yeah oh yes he
C	yeah
A	ah
C	I don't suppose you've caught up with it
A	mm
C	so he has er an adapted Polo so he can drive
A	right
C	but there's a new invention of
B	and out it comes yes
A	ah
C	his car just slides down
A	wow
C	if he can manage to get in it cos he's got his sticks and then going back you just line it up which he can do press another button and it goes back up
B	yeah
C	hugely expensive
A	mm
C	it's a lifeline for him
A	mm
B	yeah he
A	that is good
B	makes
C	yes I mean
B	yeah
C	it's a wonderful invention
B	yeah
A	that is great mm
C	yeah
B	he probably goes over to the seaside every other day doesn't he?
C	yes well obviously
A	that's nice
B	in the summertime anyhow yeah
C	he has to get out you see
B	yeah
C	you can't stay at home all day so
A	no
B	yeah
A	mm it's good
C	he managed but he gets exhausted
B	yeah
A	mm
C	and sleeps doesn't he for hours?
B	yes sleeps that's right a couple of hours
C	and he's also got erm sleep apnoea
A	oh right
C	so he has to sleep with this
A	with a mask
C	thing on as well so all in all
A	mm
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	oh right I'd forgotten that one yeah
A	mm
C	so life's a bit tough for him but he
A	yeah
B	well he gets on well with
C	yeah they do
B	those two get on well together I think yeah
A	mm
B	what's
A	yeah he's quite young isn't he?
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah must be about five
C	yeah
A	mm
B	yeah
A	hm
B	he gets about quite a lot though cos he
C	yeah he does well
B	yeah
A	yeah it's good
C	yeah
A	I can't wait for those driverless cars to be legalised here those Google cars
B	oh that sounds rather nice
C	yes I've been reading about those
A	amazing
C	yeah
A	gone on and on but the problem in the UK is the legislation apparently like if you hit someone in a driverless car who is legally responsible?
C	right
A	so until they sort that out it won't be legalised
B	yeah when you say it's a
A	yes
B	yeah
A	sitting in the driver's seat ready to take over
C	but not doing anything
A	but not doing anything which defeats the point of the object yeah
C	driverless car
A	yes
A	stupid
B	well we haven't got any of those in the UK have we?
A	no because of the legal situation
A	they can't decide who's legally responsible
B	oh
A	if the car hit something
B	oh yeah
C	so
A	don't know
C	how do they work it?
A	don't know how they
C	right
A	released these to the public yet
C	okay
A	they're still in these endless trials
B	oh yes
A	but they seem a bit more advanced there
C	they're coming dad
A	they're coming
C	yeah they're coming
A	but it will cost industries money because if no one crashes insurance goes out the window
C	no of course it does
A	so someone is gonna lose a lot of money and
C	yeah
A	mechanics will lose money
C	yeah
B	how do you have a driverless car then?
A	so then what they were doing
B	yeah
A	so it can't stop anyone going into the back of you for example so there will still be accidents
B	but then isn't another driver in the seat?
A	yes at the moment
B	yeah
A	legally there has to be someone sitting there but they're not driving
B	oh
A	the car drives itself but if they needed to they could take over
B	oh I see yeah
A	they're all on autopilot aren't they?
B	yeah
A	but they still have to have a pilot there
A	just in case
B	yeah
A	yes
C	they drive themselves
A	accepts
B	yeah
A	even though they've got five hundred people in a plane nobody questions the fact that it's on autopilot for
C	they're paranoid about that
A	oh yes
B	oh yeah
A	the Dubai metro's driverless
C	yeah
A	and we're all like fine about that
B	yes
A	we're all fine
B	have to get a driverless car
C	no
B	that'll be nice won't it? sit in the back and
A	well I'd love it
B	read the papers and
A	I think it'd be excellent
B	yeah
C	I can just see a driverless car taking that route though into
A	it'd be quite scary because
C	yes
A	they'd be a lot closer
C	quite frightening yeah
A	because it'll be really really close
C	yeah
A	and you'll think it's going to hit cos they can actually drive about fifty centimetres apart because they know whereas we have to leave you know a couple of car lengths
C	yeah
A	cos we're too slow aren't we? we'd have to be sure we could stop er
B	what happens on crossroads?
A	yes
B	I see yeah
A	but they found out that actually causes other people to go into the back
C	yeah
A	because say the light is amber
B	oh yes
A	most drivers will speed up to get through the light but this car's been programmed to stop so then people go into the back of it cos they're expecting the car in front to go through the lights so actually
B	mm
A	yes they've had to programme it to be more dangerous now to take more risks
B	yeah
A	not to crash but if it's amber for example
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	it should be programmed to speed up cos that's what other drivers do
B	have you ever seen a car on the road then like that?
A	no I want to I'm I'm excited by it
C	yeah
B	I mean take another hundred years before they get to
C	yeah
B	cars like that
A	yes
B	yes
C	and I mean it's been coming for years and considering
A	I know yeah
C	drivers you know a normal car can do things on its own now
A	yes
C	like our car can park itself
A	oh that's wonderful
B	yeah
C	I won't do it cos it frightens the life out of me
A	hm
C	I won't do it but it can do
C	and so I mean it's been coming over the years
A	yeah
B	but not all
B	not all cars have that sort of thing
A	not yet but it will come
C	but it I was just saying it's been coming because cars more and more
A	yeah
C	can do things for themselves
A	yeah
B	okay
C	but
A	it'd be nice wouldn't it?
C	yeah
B	the
C	yes it'd take you into
C	it'd be interesting to see but I would not like to be sitting I couldn't
B	yeah well
A	but then you sit in a plane where
B	yeah
A	does it do you worry about it?
C	no
A	but is that just because you can't see it do you think?
C	yes
A	it's the fact that you can't see it that allows you to relax
B	yes yeah
C	the fact that
A	yes
B	yeah
C	and to trust your car to make the right judgements while you're just sitting there
A	but don't you think that's the same as being a passenger in a lot of ways?
B	yeah
A	that you don't have a whole lot of control particularly if you were sat in the back seat I mean what am I going to do if I think you're driving dangerously? It'll be too late you'll have crashed
B	yeah
C	I I just think we look at it differently though on like a train or plane
A	yes
B	yeah
A	you just
C	the train is just
A	well it's a straight line as well
B	yeah
C	up in the sky you don't know what's going on
A	no
C	you can't see anything else that's the thing
A	that's true
C	but I think it's what you can see when you're sitting there that frightens you
A	mm
B	yeah
A	no
C	no
A	except when you get to an airport then it must be pretty terrifying
B	well
C	but yet they say planes pass each other very close in the sky
A	yes
B	oh yeah
C	you can't see the next plane
B	no no
C	but to a pilot
B	yes
C	he knows where they are
A	and they're fast as well that's the other thing you forget
B	yeah they are yeah
C	yes
A	that they're going incredibly fast so if someone gets that wrong
C	yeah
B	yeah they
A	I mean
C	yep
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	I mean you read occasionally about pilots having to take evasive action don't you because something's come too close
A	yes
B	yeah
A	they have boxes
C	yes
A	like that doesn't work so now
C	yeah
A	they've got one box talking to the other and they can decide instantaneously
B	mm
A	we're going down we're going up whereas people take too long
C	they're
B	yeah
A	scary again though
B	well it's all changed
A	yes
B	in my day we flew an aeroplane
C	yeah
B	to press any buttons
A	yeah
B	usually they have a guy outside the
C	hope he gets stuck back in time
B	in time
A	yeah
C	lose an arm or your head
B	yeah that's right yeah yeah
A	yeah
A	so big now
A	so big these planes huge
B	I know they're
C	yeah
A	they can't get that close one behind the other because apparently
B	yeah
A	the turbulence behind these huge jumbo jets is so big that a smaller lighter plane could be sucked into it
A	and crash
A	they they actually have a special call sign like heavy these big planes and nothing can go within about three miles behind it
B	yeah
A	either side or behind
A	yeah very frightening
B	yeah
A	mm
B	mum used to not like sitting
A	no
B	do you do you have travels?
A	no but
B	yeah
A	little
C	oh
B	oh yes
A	he hates planes doesn't he?
C	but he's never been in a big one you see
B	yeah
C	he's always been in little planes
A	yes
C	so yeah
B	yeah
A	mm
B	he's only been
A	yes and that is different
A	cos you are right there aren't you? and again you can see the pilot and
B	well yeah you you're low down anyhow
A	it all feels
B	yeah
A	you can feel the movement a lot more
B	well no also if you're only flying at a hundred feet
A	that's true
A	yes
B	I tell
A	don't notice
B	take him on a long trip somewhere and that will make a difference
A	I think he won't go go on one
B	will he not?
C	no he's been put off
B	oh has he?
C	which is unfortunate really
B	oh yes he ought to go somewhere
A	yes
B	grow older and gets a big job he'll be flying all over the place
C	no
A	no
A	or not because
A	oh these are dangerous grandpa had a couple
A	I've been good no
C	you sure?
A	no no mustn't ruin my appetite
C	oh
A	they are nice
C	thank you
A	no you're welcome
B	what's this one?
C	alright?
A	yeah fine yeah
C	do you?
A	driverless cars
C	oh I quite like it
A	yeah
C	if you're driving in civilised place
A	well I think that's part of it
C	I don't like driving in the Middle East
A	Middle East
C	oh
A	I love the roads though there
C	yeah
A	the roads are amazing but then you've got rubbish driver behaviour
B	yeah
A	here it's the opposite the roads are pretty bad
C	yeah
A	but I don't like you know things like
B	yeah
A	that road into
C	no that's all
A	parking that's horrible
A	and it's aggressive as well
B	yes
C	yeah
A	oh
C	what's the matter dad?
A	but it's time for a big change there
C	they're all marked
B	oh well how does this one go on there?
C	it's a fan
B	yeah
C	oh look they're all I've put labels on them
B	oh have you?
C	but you can't read my writing
B	that's
A	oh dear
C	dad would you like a couple of these? I know you've been eating them
B	oh I know
C	cos it was full
C	mine
B	oh really?
B	oh
A	I love these rice crispy things though they really remind me of being little cos we used
B	they're
A	that was probably the first thing I ever cooked cos it was about the simplest thing you could teach a child to make
B	oh yeah
A	rice crispy cakes
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah those and the cornflake cakes
A	yes so they're a bit nostalgic quite a clever idea of theirs
B	sounds nice yeah
A	yes? shall I get some?
B	would you like sparkling water
A	would you like some? or it's not your thing
C	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	they are not sure about what kind of drink he likes	Neutral
A	ah yes don't want to ruin the effects with dilution
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	this is not alcoholic though by the way this is a
C	I'll just have a little sample then
B	oh
C	yeah she's she is very nice
B	yeah
C	but she talks such a lot
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about book	Contradiction
B	oh yeah
C	exhausting
B	who's that lady
C	who's that
B	by by by the
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about weather	Contradiction
C	yes
C	yeah
B	oh
B	why? why was I in Vietnam then?
C	no idea dad
B	cos I remember going to Saigon
C	mm
B	must have been on some
C	no
B	he obviously came from a very wealthy background
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about wealthy background	Neutral
C	and
B	yeah
A	here's one
C	thank you
A	there's more if you like it
C	alright
[ANNOTATION]	person C likes get more	Entailment
B	what have we here
A	this is erm like sparkling water
B	oh
A	but with erm elderberry and elderflower
B	oh
B	yeah
C	erm yeah I think so
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about drink	Entailment
B	yeah
C	all their lives haven't they?
B	but but I noticed with the other one that how nice they keep their gardens like
C	yeah it's lovely
B	yeah they've got everything just laid out and
C	yeah it's all very neat
B	yeah very neat and tidy
A	and there's more if anyone wants
B	oh
A	I know you said
C	yeah
A	I think it's cos they're tapered they look erm
B	oh oh it's tapered?
A	yeah you think there's going to be more in it
A	yeah it's really half a bottle
B	yeah
A	it's clever packaging
B	yeah
B	yeah where where do we did you buy that one
A	mm
B	yeah
A	I love elderflower cordial
A	and I'm so pleased it's come back in fashion cos it used
B	yeah
A	I don't think you could buy it it was one of those things that'd gone out completely but now it's everywhere
B	everywhere yeah
A	you go into pubs and there's elderflower this and elderflower that
C	yeah it's true yeah
A	and yeah
B	yeah I think it was in mum's
A	yes exactly yes
C	yes
B	yeah
A	it's something much older
C	yeah
A	very traditional
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	but it's very fashionable now
C	because I have an elderly friend in
C	yes
A	mm I don't know about the wine it was the cordial I liked
C	right
A	so just so it's like a you know like squash just water it down
B	yeah
A	but you need to buy citric acid to make it
B	yeah
A	which you can't get everywhere I think you have to go to the chemist
C	oh okay mm
B	I think your mum used to like sparkling wine didn't she?
C	she did
A	ah yes that's nice
C	so what is
A	yeast I suppose to make it ferment you'd need to add yeast
C	right
A	elderflower cordial?
C	no the wine
A	oh the wine I don't know
C	cos when she gave it to me she said it wasn't at all so
A	I haven't had any actually
A	I've never had elderflower wine
C	it's
A	yeah I think those homemade wines
A	yes they're not great
A	well my
A	but it's cos I'd only had their homemade thing
B	yeah
C	really?
A	tiny bit
B	yeah
A	cos it put her off for life she doesn't drink at all
B	yeah
A	but that's why and I didn't drink much
B	but your mum likes a glass of cider doesn't she?
A	she's gone off it lately
B	has she? yeah
A	oh but you know what she likes now she's gotten into those fruit ciders that are in have you seen those?
C	oh yes there's pear and all sorts erm
A	strawberry and
B	really?
A	I can see
B	yeah
A	yes but they're very popular
B	yeah
A	made yogurt the other day
C	did you?
A	yogurt yogurt maker
B	oh you like yogurts do you?
A	yes
B	yeah ah
A	yes
B	in years gone by
C	I eat erm
A	yes

A	ah right well that's what it would be it would be the one so it's actually live
C	yeah
A	still so it's very good for you
B	have you got
A	easy to make
B	yeah
A	so easy with the machine just pour the milk in turn it on and that's it
C	yeah
B	have you
C	well I eat natural yogurt not fruit yogurt
B	oh
C	cos there's no sugar or anything and
B	I know
C	and I eat it every morning with chopped fruit in it
B	what
A	hm
B	I haven't taken
C	very good good way to start the day

A	ah thank you
C	raid the fridge
B	yeah
C	plenty of fruit as you'll see
A	yes lots of fruit you're you're good at eating fruit
B	plenty of fruit in there
C	yeah
A	yes
B	that's not
A	yes
B	usually it's
A	healthy
C	oh that's er er
B	oh did they?
B	I don't remember
C	yeah
B	did they come to speak to
C	I think they must have done if they'd seen you they would speak you know what they're like
B	oh well probably
A	hm
B	really
C	yeah
A	hm
B	if it's got the Tesco but I never go in
C	it's quite small that Tesco
B	yes
C	well when we lived in York
B	I thought you did yeah
C	that was useful cos it was so near
B	oh
C	and it's one of those twenty-four hour like
B	oh okay
A	mm
C	but no I don't really like these great big supermarkets but there we are
B	they're useful I suppose
C	useful
B	yes yeah yeah
A	this is another of my honeymoon things the supermarkets here
B	yes
A	are so good compared to abroad
C	they are
A	there is no comparison
C	yeah
A	because it's a one
B	exactly
A	you can get your photos developed you've got a pharmacy with a pharmacist
C	yeah
A	you can do all these things in supermarkets
C	yeah
B	of course yeah yeah
A	I'm just amazed
B	yeah
A	I can even get my car cleaned inside and out while I'm doing my shop
B	yeah
A	they've got this new thing scan as you go have you seen that?
C	yeah
A	amazing
C	yeah
A	so you take your bags in cos you know you have to take your own bags now so you scan as you go and you put it in your shopping bag and then when you it's the end instead of having to take it out and put it all on the conveyor belt one by one
C	one by one
B	yeah
A	you don't you just pay
B	well what's to stop you putting in something and not scanning it?
A	nothing er except they do random checks but I've been I they checked the first one to check you did it right but they don't check everything they just check like three items to check you didn't steal those three items and after that it's random that you don't know when it's going to be so it's supposed to be
C	so you could get stopped
A	you could get stopped
C	oh so that's how it works I've always wondered
C	yeah
A	but I do it today
C	yeah when you feed everything onto the yeah
A	so you do everything twice you put it all in one by one then you take it all out one by one and then you have to re-pack it one by one
C	and then
A	so it's triple the work
B	ah
A	so you just do it once
C	yeah that's logical but I've
A	what
C	what's to stop people loading up and not scanning it and then escaping with free stuff
A	well I think they must do it
B	must try and run after you
A	but you wonder
B	yeah
A	how if they've calculated that in the cost of someone's wage
C	yeah
B	oh yeah
A	versus the odd person who steals
C	yeah
A	cos you probably won't steal the whole trolley load
C	oh no
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	but you think I wonder if they'd calculated that in
C	they must do because there's gonna be an element of people sneaking in one or two things and not paying
A	mm
C	I don't know there has to be
A	but they must think they save money overall
C	yeah
A	which is amazing isn't it?
C	did you hear that dad? about scan as you go?
B	no
C	you can go into the supermarket and get a little handheld device and as you shop you put it you scan it the item and then you put it straight into your shopping bag
B	oh
C	so that when you come to the till you don't have to be doing this with all your goods because you've already recorded it on this device and it's already in your shopping bag
B	what about if you've decided not to put one on there?
C	well this is what we just said to
A	yeah
A	yes well we think it must happen
A	sometimes they check but not every time
B	oh I see must be
A	yeah
C	I mean I wouldn't dare risk it
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	oh I'm sorry I must have forgotten
B	no
A	yes oh it must have broken
B	ah yes
A	yes so I'm sure you get away with that I mean you'd be suspicious if you had lots of things
B	yeah
C	yes
A	if it was one thing you'd probably get away with it
C	so when you come to pay you just show this device to a terminal thing do you?
A	yes you
C	yeah
A	and then if you bought alcohol then it beeps for the woman to come anyway to check the
C	yes
A	you know over eighteen but if you've not you've not got a restricted item it just tells you to pay and that's the end
C	I'm going to try that
A	yeah that fun it was really fun
C	I I've put off finding out how it works I thought oh
A	yes that was very exciting development for me
B	oh absolutely I see yes
A	there'll be supermarkets with no people soon
C	yeah
A	that'll be the next thing all those checkouts'll disappear and just be these terminals
C	yes
B	oh yeah
A	which is a huge help and it's quite easy to take things off
B	yeah yes you are
A	sort of adding it up in your head but you never quite know because you don't know really what the fruit weighs and
C	so supposing you put something in your basket and then and you've scanned it and you think no I don't actually want this you can take it out and
A	yes you you press the remove button and then it says
C	right
A	scan the item you want to remove and you scan it and it says do you want to remove this tin of baked beans?
B	oh
A	and you say yes
C	right
A	that's it
C	yeah
A	you have to scan it six times whereas at the till they just press six don't they?
C	yeah
B	mm
C	okay
A	so that's a bit annoying because you're buying
A	but I like the fact it adds it up
B	yeah
A	that is useful knowing what you've spent before you go to the till
C	so you can tally as you go along you can see how much you
A	yes
B	how much to spend yeah
A	cos I'd
B	yeah
A	yeah so I like it
A	exactly
A	I mean that's only happened to me a couple of times but
B	yeah
A	it is a bit embarrassing
B	forty-five pounds
A	you have to take that off
C	oh dear
B	no no
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	well I suppose now we've all got cards but
B	yes
C	yeah
A	yeah
B	and then I had to go with her to
A	well it is it's embarrassing
B	yeah
A	get there and you can't pay
B	oh yeah
A	mm
B	I know the guy there remembers your mum quite a bit and
C	does he?
B	well no he was working in Tesco that's why I'm
A	mm
A	yes I love the supermarkets
B	beg pardon?
A	I think they're amazing our supermarkets
A	yes
B	get everything in there
A	yeah get everything
C	did you erm
A	yes Carrefour French one
B	oh
A	Waitrose actually they've got but not they're not very big
C	yeah
B	no
A	they're pretty small
C	we had erm
A	oh yes Lulu don't like Lulu
C	and
A	ah yes they have those
A	in the UAE but only on the edge of cities so
C	right
A	didn't really go there
B	don't you have Lidl's
B	oh I
C	in the Middle East they have hypermarkets which are absolutely massive
A	yes
B	oh yeah
C	but even then
A	they can't
C	you can't find everything you want
B	everything you want
C	so you end up going to another one and then to another one
B	yeah
C	it's a pain
A	and they only do food really don't they? food and
C	no
A	inside the supermarket you'd have to go out and look around the mall
C	yeah
A	electrical yes electricals
C	yeah
A	computers and TVs and things
C	yeah
A	mm
C	no you're right
A	photo development or
C	but I think
A	key cutting or
C	you often find though if they're in a mall which they are you've got the bureau de change and the
A	yes
C	photo place haven't you?
A	yeah that's true
C	it's not in store though
A	no
B	yeah I've seen yeah
A	yes we're good at supermarkets here
B	oh
A	well we the country we do supermarkets well
B	country
A	and there's a lot of choice here as well
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	you've got a choice of six or seven in
B	yeah
A	a reasonable sized town haven't you?
C	yes
B	yeah
A	Lidl and you've got your Waitrose and
B	Waitrose
A	Sainsbury's
B	yeah Sainsbury's
A	Tesco it's not bad
C	yes
B	pound shops
A	but my goodness you get a bargain
B	pound a time some
A	and they're a fraction of the price of the supermarket cos
C	yes
A	yeah
A	went to Halfords
B	oh
A	they're smaller lights
C	perfectly good
A	and they're fine so I'm legal I can go on the road with them
B	oh
C	yeah
A	how
C	yes ridiculous isn't it?
B	yeah
A	same with ironing boards went to Tesco
B	yeah
A	go to the pound store they're ten pounds
B	yeah

A	I don't know
C	not in
B	yeah
A	yeah Exeter's got loads of them too many it's there's just that one after another but they are very cheap
B	have they?
C	there's er a little store where they sell things for a pound they're in
B	what on the corner there is it?
C	yeah
B	yeah
B	oh
A	mm
C	yeah
A	yeah cos Tesco's is cheap for food
[ANNOTATION]	food is cheap at Tesco	Entailment
B	yeah
A	but they're very expensive for non-food items
C	yes
A	and you've got to watch that
C	yeah
B	yeah yeah
A	they're really cheeky enough adaptors will cost four pounds when they should be fifty P
C	it's ridiculous yeah
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	products from Tesco have bad quality	Neutral
A	yeah
B	cos basically Morrison's has got most things you want you don't have to go anywhere else do you?
A	yes
B	they're pretty big stores
C	mm
A	mm
B	and they've got pretty well everything in there
C	I think the difference is though between er Morrison's is good in
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	non-food products are pricey at Tesco	Entailment
B	yeah
C	but the Tesco's at
B	oh
[ANNOTATION]	Morrison's has few varieties	Contradiction
C	a bigger electrical section
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	you

C	mm
B	but that's not Morrison's
[ANNOTATION]	the shops are selling meat	Neutral
C	well I hope so but there was nobody in there
B	oh

B	ah
A	yes that's the thing
B	are you a fish eater?
A	I love fish and that was the one thing the gulf is very good at
C	yes they are

[ANNOTATION]	speaker a likes to eat fish	Entailment
A	and the prawns the size of the prawns out there compared to here
B	yeah
C	they're massive
A	cos here
[ANNOTATION]	the fish in the supermarkets in the gulf is not fresh at all	Contradiction
A	their small prawns out there are our jumbo ones here
C	the moment you buy massive prawns

B	yes
A	everything
B	off
C	oh
A	the satnav but also insurance I

A	until they see a written quote cos that's how much of a problem it is that people cannot insure a new build house because it's not on any one system
C	yeah
A	fine from the beginning
B	yeah
A	it's because it's all computerised and people don't update their massive software every day
C	I know that we had that in York cos we were renting a new build
A	crazy
C	and it wasn't recognised anywhere except by the post office
A	yeah can't help you
C	no
A	Barclays bank who I've banked with for about fifteen years said they couldn't insure me
B	oh blimey yeah
A	yeah and then I went a couple of weeks ago and said why don't you have your house insurance with us?
C	yeah it's your fault
B	yeah
B	yes
A	oh yes you must be a new build
A	yeah it is funny that's very odd though
C	yeah
B	you still have to get competitive prices do you when you
A	well you see I haven't been able to because if this postcode problem
B	no no
A	so I only had a choice of about three in the end when you should have you know thirty to choose from
B	yeah
A	but hopefully by next year
B	yeah I see
A	might be free again
A	okay oh that's good
C	yeah
A	yes
B	rather than your telephone number
A	your okay
A	yes and thank you for your housewarming card I got that
C	good
C	I thought it would be it's always nice
A	so that was nice yeah it was nice
B	yeah
A	they haven't found me yet
C	yes you find a whole pile of brown envelopes when you arrive don't you?
B	yeah
A	yeah well luckily they haven't found me
C	oh
A	I must be not on their system either
C	they're coming
A	no water bill
C	they're coming
A	no council tax bill
C	and it says dear occupier
A	the only one that's found me is the TV licensing
A	but that
B	yeah
C	you do
A	yes it's good
A	I don't know
B	I think it's over seventy
C	yeah
B	oh there we are
B	yes
A	oh that's a good idea
B	oh yes that's right yeah
A	mm
C	I mean that's how we
B	when's
C	no next June but that's how we got a big discount on the new gas boiler
A	oh
B	yeah
C	because of his age
B	oh that's useful then
A	that is useful
C	sixty-five yes so the guy said to me madam I hope you don't mind me saying so but you don't quite look the right age
B	oh
A	plastic surgery does wonders these days
B	yeah
B	yeah
C	erm
B	was he there at the time?
C	yes he was
B	oh was he? oh well I say there we are
C	he was yes I mean that makes sense
B	oh
A	mm
C	cos the government's encouraging everybody to invest in new boilers to be more economic
A	ah
C	so
A	I don't have a boiler
C	do you not?
A	no
B	no
A	well actually I have a boiler I don't have a hot water tank
B	oh
A	it's all done externally so
B	oh is it?
A	hot water is on all of the time
B	oh
C	oh wow
A	with Eon
A	by the airport
A	and that's for the whole town
B	oh
C	I read about this somewhere
A	the disadvantage is it's a monopoly
B	yes
A	so we can't shop around
C	yes
A	mm
B	yeah
A	hm
B	yeah
A	until it breaks
B	yeah
A	then we're in trouble
B	yes
A	the good thing is everyone would be in trouble so they'd have to come and sort it out
C	yeah
A	mm
B	I always thought that was a nice house
C	yeah it was a lovely house
B	yeah
C	just not right for us and too big
B	oh it was too big was it?
C	far too big
B	I suppose
C	two of us
C	yeah but I mean how often do they come and visit?
A	mm
C	and and the village was just too quiet it was
B	oh
C	yeah it was it was nice
B	yeah
C	it's erm about six miles from there dad
B	oh oh not too far away then
C	yeah
C	right I'm going to
C	shall I turn this off? it
B	what time? yeah
A	it is hot isn't it? mm
B	yeah I put these on
A	I'll do it
B	well they're both on that's why
A	ah
B	yeah they're
A	that'll be why
B	yeah
C	well you've drunk a lot of water today dad
C	you've drunk a lot of water today
B	yeah I can't remember drinking any
B	yes that one
A	six o'clock
B	six o'clock?
A	and it's erm about twenty to now
B	oh plenty of time then no great hurry
A	no
B	okay
A	erm
B	oh he has?
A	sometimes a little bit I read
A	I read on my phone mostly or on the
B	oh yeah
A	yes
B	well you can't read all of what's in The Mail on the thing
A	no
B	headlines isn't it? yes
A	I get the BBC news on my phone
B	oh do you? oh that's okay
A	quite good
B	you see I I'm used to papers not the other thing
A	yeah no it's nice to have a paper
B	yeah
A	different
B	do you
A	I heard Google's going to pay some tax that's a surprise
B	oh
A	because they've not been paying for years
B	no they
A	billion yeah well I don't know
B	yeah
A	but they've they've come to some deal with HMRC they're going to pay twenty-three million
B	yeah still
A	but apparently that works out as a three percent tax rate so
B	oh
A	nothing compared to what they should have paid
B	no
A	so they've been cheeky but it's better than
B	better than nothing yeah
A	I mean they they've done zero but I think they shouldn't get away with that to be honest
B	how come the
A	well they've used all these tax avoidance schemes
B	oh
A	so they're not actually illegal
B	no no
A	well they will be this year
A	but historically they've not been
B	yeah
A	illegal
B	mm
A	but what they do is they say their headquartered somewhere else
B	yes
A	and then
B	yeah Irish yeah
A	and so even though they do most of their business here
B	is in Ireland yeah yeah yeah
A	but that's the problem but they've all been doing that
B	yeah
A	and basically all of these big corporations have paid no tax
B	oh
A	but erm it's catching up with them
B	oh well
A	which is good
B	our taxes will go down then?
A	well
A	that would be nice
A	but sadly
B	yeah yeah oh well
A	it does seem unfair doesn't it?
B	yeah
A	cos small businesses
B	yeah
A	would always have to pay
B	yeah
A	it's the big ones that get away with paying
B	are they taking yours out of your pay packet now?
A	yes which is better
B	oh yeah
A	I think that's much better isn't it?
B	but do you know whether it's correct what they take out?
A	no but I have to do a self-assessment each year I get erm
B	oh do you?
A	so
B	yeah
A	and then it works it out
B	well
A	yes cos she's self-employed and for me it's cos I've had more than one job
B	yeah
A	so I'm always over taxed and then each year
B	oh
A	to date I've always had a rebate
B	yeah
A	of a few hundred pounds
B	I think
A	yeah
B	I remember once with
B	to be taxed
A	that's true
B	so
A	yeah
B	yeah
B	and and a a new pair of shoes or something to take into the classroom
A	oh right
B	or whatever
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	that's funny
B	yeah
A	yeah so hopefully I'll get something back I've just done mine cos the deadline's the thirty-first of January
B	yes
A	if you do it online
B	oh
A	I just did mine a few days ago and
B	yeah
A	hopefully I'll get something back
B	it's okay
A	no
B	well anyway they look on the scale of things
A	no no that's true they well they
B	to yeah
A	the next year's one
A	that's what they always ask do you want us to take this from next year?
B	well it's always nice to postpone it
A	yes
B	yeah
A	yes
B	yeah
A	yes so hopefully I won't get a
B	did you get yourself a new bike? I
A	no I'm using dad's one at the moment
B	oh yeah
A	cos he doesn't erm use his so I'll just use that for now
A	and then I'll probably just get a second-hand one at some point
B	oh yes
A	but actually the fold up ones are good cos they do fit in the boot of the car easily
B	yeah
A	so you don't have to put the seats down
B	oh
A	and then in the house as well
B	yeah
A	you don't really want bikes in the hallway and things
B	yeah
A	so
B	oh
A	so maybe I should get a fold up one?
B	yeah
A	the thing is fold up ones aren't very good if you're going long distance
B	no they're
A	cos the wheels are tiny they're only about that big
B	oh that's
A	but if it's city kind of commuting
B	yeah
A	it's fine
B	oh right
A	and they've still got you know seven gears
B	oh
A	very small
B	seven
A	yes
B	oh that's a lot
A	yes
B	yeah
A	you're pedalling
B	faster
A	more
B	yeah
A	than if you had a bigger bike but
B	yeah
A	but the distances aren't very big
B	yeah
A	so
B	is your dad still out on bikes?
A	not at the moment
A	he's swimming at the moment
B	oh
A	he's doing loads of swimming
B	I thought
A	he's doing that wild swimming
B	oh yeah
A	he is doing that yes so he's doing that spinning
B	a big ride somewhere
A	he's doing what's called spinning
B	spinning I don't know what that means no
A	it means you do indoors on one of those stationary bikes
B	oh that must be very boring
A	I think it's boring yes
A	but he's in a
B	yeah
A	you're in a class with other people and then there's loud music
B	oh I see
A	and there's a instructor telling you to go faster or
B	oh
A	I don't know
B	oh
A	yes I suppose it's a bit competitive
B	oh yeah
A	so he's doing that and
B	yeah your mum's not into that though is she?
A	oh no
B	I was gonna say
A	she doesn't like that no they can't cycle together
B	can't they?
A	no cos dad likes to cycle really fast
B	and your mum wants slow
A	and mum wants to go slow so they can't cycle together
B	oh oh yes
A	and dad's very impatient
B	oh that's
A	bed and breakfast all the way
B	oh that's nice
A	I hope the weather's nice
B	yeah
A	it's not er known for its good weather
B	it's gonna be cold up in Scotland yeah at this time of year
A	yes
B	where did I go with mum?
A	ah yes
B	yes
A	that's right you went to see
B	yeah we met up somewhere
A	oh wasn't it? oh okay
A	you stayed in Edinburgh recently on the
B	Waverly it comes in
A	Waverly yes that's the big station isn't it? Edinburgh Waverly
B	is it?
A	yes
B	ah
A	yes there's a
B	ah yeah I think that's in
A	ah right yes yes that was
B	you know Scotland quite well do you?
A	no I know Edinburgh reasonably well
B	yeah
A	but I don't know
B	it was when we used to
A	yeah
B	cos in the early days it was miles away from down here
A	it still is
A	well yes well it definitely is by road isn't it?
B	well you get as far as
A	yes that's right
B	where did
A	oh you've gone to France with
B	yeah
A	no France probably
A	mm
B	she suddenly found her
A	oh that's nice
B	she was able to chat with them quite easily actually
A	oh good
B	yeah
A	yes
B	no she does Spanish as well
A	yeah
B	oh I I don't think she was going to
A	ah yes yes she was doing some sort of course at the adult learning college
A	but she was saying it's stopped now
B	oh does it?
A	she she's doing self-study at home but it's not the same you need a
A	particularly language cos you need someone well first of all to converse
B	yeah
A	with
B	I think I think
A	yes
B	not any more no everyone speaks English don't
A	yes
B	at least very often very often the case
A	and that was in the newspaper this morning
B	yeah yeah
A	on the BBC that GCSE and A level numbers have fallen
B	yeah
A	hugely in the last few years for French
B	yeah
A	and for German
B	oh
A	apparently it's Labour's fault
B	what's the language in in
A	Spanish
B	oh yeah
A	a lot
B	oh yeah
A	erm so yes they think that's what accounts for most of the fall
B	oh
A	yes
B	yeah cos I suppose Spanish is
A	yes and the States as well now
B	the States is Spanish is it?
A	yes
B	oh
A	a lot of Hispanic
B	but they come up from south I suppose some of them
A	yes
B	ah
A	yeah
B	oh
A	and then of course all of South America
B	well it's all Spanish down there
A	pretty much isn't it?
B	pretty well yeah down there
A	Portuguese in Brazil but they're not
B	oh
A	well they are they're different but it's the same roots but
B	yeah
A	mm
B	and somewhere else I
A	where's that?
B	on the way to South America somewhere
A	I don't know
B	what's that big port we used to stop off at?
B	er
A	ah right
B	I don't know where that was
A	no
B	wasn't the Falklands anyway we were on the way down there somewhere I suppose I I've forgotten where we were
A	mm don't know
B	oh Falklands
A	no
A	no
A	I'd like to go to the Galapagos Islands
B	oh oh that's in
A	yeah
B	some
A	oh right yes

B	yeah I
A	mm
B	and they had little frogs about this big
A	oh right
B	yeah they pretty well
A	ah
B	a tiny little thing
A	ah that's nice
B	never seen one like that about this big in there

A	yes yes I like animals
B	given up on those have you?
A	for now
A	yeah I like them
B	oh birds was the other your biggest thing
A	yes

B	er
A	she's got yes cos she was never interested was she? she never really enjoyed it
B	yeah
A	yes she's done a lot with the heathers
B	with the heathers
A	yes
A	and then last year she grew tomatoes for the first time
B	oh I know she's very
A	she got very excited about those
B	very proud of those
A	yes she was very proud of those
B	yeah
A	yes
A	yes
B	the best she's ever tasted
A	yes I know
B	yeah yeah
A	but it is nice to grow things yourself
B	yeah I suppose yeah
A	to see something through from the beginning
B	yeah
A	yes but yes she was very excited
B	but anyway
A	she has yeah
B	when when dad's got away from her she's got into it a bit
