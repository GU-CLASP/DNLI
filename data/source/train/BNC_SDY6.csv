B	I turned it down I said I if I want something nan I'll give you a
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	nothing fantastic but you know we had an
A	yeah
B	so I left at eight o'clock in the morning and got back at four
A	mm that is a long day
B	so it's an eight hour day which your mother had made two cakes
B	and that was about her lot
A	yeah I was surprised why didn't mum come and pick me up?
B	oh I don't know I just don't I mean since Friday night when she got in
A	yeah
B	this morning I got up at six made the tea did some ironing went off at eight and she she hadn't moved from bed
A	yeah
B	I dunno it's crap absolute crap
A	did she come to
B	no
A	no?
B	cos she
A	what tiling?
B	there's some tiling to do those strips of
A	oh yeah yeah yeah in the bathroom
B	yeah and then she comes down and says have you thrown away? I don't give a fucking shit if I've thrown away
B	it's not stopping you making a bloody cake or anything is it? it's just the
A	yeah
B	you know it just don't make any sense anyway how did you get on?
A	good
B	yeah?
A	it was really good and really fun well I wouldn't well well
B	yeah
A	oh yeah no it was quite fun actually
B	how was your running mate was she alright?
A	she was fine yeah she came in a little bit after me she came in like ten minutes after me but
B	well you were ran together though?
A	well we did we got to ten miles together and then she started to drop off a bit and
B	and you
A	no no no I tried but it was quite difficult
B	it's quite
A	it's quite difficult to run at someone else's pace
B	I know it's the same as cycling you've just gotta go at your pace
A	yeah
B	and erm you know it's okay if you're in a team and you're behind somebody else you'll be
A	yeah
B	but as you go on further you just can't do it can you?
A	yeah like I tried and stuff and it kind of became really annoying because people kept walking which I realised don't get me wrong
B	well no I mean I just think if you can't run thirteen miles don't do the
A	well yeah don't enter it yeah
B	fucking thirteen miles yeah
A	yeah I I did
B	you know
A	think that like there were people
B	I mean a thirteen mile walk is is anybody could do a thirteen mile
A	yeah
B	bloody walk
A	there were like people walking really early on and you're just like why did you enter? like I actually I did actually run all of it I didn't walk once
B	particularly as it's on a ballot is it?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	some of it's for charity
B	yeah
A	some people get charity places
B	yeah
A	but then you kind of like you're you're raising money because you're gonna run this run and you don't run it you walk it and it's a bit like
A	what's the point? if you can't run thirteen miles
B	well no there's not point doing it yeah I know
A	don't enter the half marathon yeah
B	I know
A	but no it was really good they had loads of like Great North Run events going on on Saturday
B	good
A	and then this morning it was Mo Mo got his fifty-nine minutes didn't he?
B	did he?
A	Mo Farah
B	oh oh dear that would have been
A	yeah Mo Farah ran he got his personal best of a half marathon
B	what for the
A	for the what? did you say ten metres?
B	ten well I meant ten thousand
A	oh I see yeah
B	yeah
A	no for the half marathon he won the er he won it and he did it in fifty-nine point eighteen seconds
B	oh did he?
A	or something like that fifty-nine minutes eighteen seconds last year he got over he didn't get under an hour and he was a little unhappy
B	oh right
A	oh
B	well I I got back from
A	mm
B	under forty-five minutes for my loop
A	what loop? how many miles is it?
B	it's twelve and a
A	I know but isn't it embarrassing that well not embarrassing but isn't it weird that Mo Farah can run thirteen miles in nearly the same amount of time it takes you to cycle it?
B	he's not going up and down my hills though I tell you
A	no he's not no that's true I was thinking that today cos like by the time we cross the finish
B	how long did it take you to cross the start line?
B	oh bloody hell
A	I know there were thousands of people
B	how did you meet up again then
A	cos we all
B	to go for the last part
A	cos they have like a family reunion section
B	right
A	sadly none of my family were there at reunite with me but erm
B	your mother she yeah your mother went she went to she went to Liverpool this morning
B	that's a good idea
A	last name is Z
A	we'll go to
B	good idea
A	the zed section so we met up with
B	did did
A	no
B	oh so how did you meet beforehand on it?
A	well how did I meet
B	yeah
A	in general? oh I met
B	no today with
A	oh
A	er I'm I met her in a café
B	oh right
A	we met them in a
B	oh right
A	in a café in
B	did you go out last night then?
A	no dad I didn't
B	oh didn't you?
A	I went to bed quite early last
B	oh did you?
A	well no I went to bed at about ten last night
B	right
A	then the youth hostel was fine
B	yeah you said yeah
A	actually no
B	the smell of liniment was all over the place was it?
A	it really wasn't like I wandered round and I spent the day on Saturday wandering around Newcastle and I wouldn't say it was overly busy
B	oh
A	today obviously was the
B	did you go over to the museum in Gateshead? did you go were you going over there? no? the
A	oh no I went to
B	oh right that's right
A	I did pop in today yeah er yesterday
B	as you do you just pop in
A	pop into the
B	pole oh
A	pole voters? pole vaulters and erm that's not what I'm saying
B	oh
A	oh no high
B	yeah pole vaulting yeah
A	yeah pole vaulting and they had like and they got kids involved and did like kids' running races
B	yeah
A	and I think they had the junior Great North Run which was like five o'clock until like
B	very good
A	erm
B	was anybody else you knew running it?
A	no
B	it's like these you know
A	who knows?
A	there's one every week it's like it's like music festivals innit? you can go er
A	what running races?
B	yeah you can do about
A	oh yeah
B	half a dozen a week these days I mean
A	I could run I could run a ten K every week pretty much if I wanted to
B	yeah
A	from now until
B	do they?
A	but erm in the winter you can run one like every week
B	oh right
A	there's loads coming up in
B	yeah there's the cycling erm
A	yeah
B	I went on one I didn't pay for cos they turned up and said you needed a helmet so I thought fuck this for a bunch of
B	so I followed the signs round stopped off at the food
A	yeah
B	and then I did one but they only did half of what I originally intended to do so in future I'm not sure that it's actually
A	yeah
B	that day that was good but the rest of them I haven't really enjoyed
A	I think running is a bit
B	yeah
A	running races kind of give you a set distance and they give you the route and it means you don't have to plan it yourself
B	well that's the same whether it's the that's the same
A	yeah
B	with the Sportive but they're not races
A	no no same as
B	but
A	like
B	but but they time you well well there isn't a single cyclist now who needs an external timer cos they've all got
A	yeah
B	they've all got Garmins or whatever they've got
A	I know someone said to me the other day cos I said that I was running this and they're like oh have you got your Garmin ready? I'm like no and they're like oh why do you not have one? I'm like because I don't need one I run over the finish line it tells me how long it took me I'm happy with that like
B	yeah
A	like I don't care how fast I'm running it's not gonna
B	yeah yeah
A	why would I need to spend sixty pounds on a
B	yeah
A	watch?
[ANNOTATION]	Spending sixty pounds on a smart watch is well spent money	Contradiction
B	like mine's erm mine on the bike is four thirty quid forty quid I think to fit it on the wireless
A	yeah
B	speedo thing I did I tell you when I was going up a hill one day and this voice said next door to me you have done sixteen point four miles an hour for the last mile?
A	oh wow was that the thing?
B	this no this bloke must have had a verbal Garmin
A	oh god
B	as he cycled up the hill past me
A	see but they have it on the Ipod the Ipod has a fitness app and it tells you like
B	well that's probably what it was then
[ANNOTATION]	A uses the fitness app on their Ipod	Neutral
A	it's like when it's like you have done three kilometres
B	yeah
A	it's like great thanks
B	yeah
A	just in case I wasn't aware of that
B	I know
A	but but today's run actually was okay
A	I generally thought I was gonna die like
B	were you?
A	I was really really nervous
A	about doing it and then actually I didn't get tired at all
B	no
A	well my legs are really sore but my actual breathing was fine like I know that
B	yeah
A	my lung capacity er erm I'm capable of
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	A did not run today	Contradiction
A	doing it
B	yeah I
A	my legs are just a bit
B	I factored I that I was not really I I
[ANNOTATION]	A did a very good run today	Entailment
A	yeah yeah I
B	you know you go through when I I slightly too heavier than I am but Friday
A	me too
B	Friday night's gym was just an absolute doddle
A	yeah
B	you know the it's a forty-five minute spin and ab
A	yeah
B	and the ab was just not an issue at all
A	I I find with running
[ANNOTATION]	B has a fitness tracker on their bike	Entailment
B	it's it's not that each exercise doesn't hurt
A	no no it's just yeah
B	but you're not you're not dying for two days after
A	yeah yeah
B	like you used to be you know
A	I find with running is that you run to the distance so if you're running a ten like if I'm running a ten K I'll be really knackered by the time I get
[ANNOTATION]	B and A has become more fit than they used to be	Entailment
B	yeah don't ask me to run another kilometre
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	but if er like today I was like okay another mile another mile
B	yeah
A	and then like by the time and they have like countdowns like you've got eight hundred metres to go
B	oh right
A	you've got four hundred metres it's like oh my god this is the longest four hundred metres of my entire life
B	oh right
A	oh well done man cross over the the white line that you're not allowed to cross over just
B	yes you are the if it's
A	oh okay I take it back
B	you can do but you know
A	yeah but no if you
B	what do you want to do for dinner?
A	is there anything?
B	yeah well we've got a
A	er
B	chicken will chicken salad do you?
A	oh yeah I'll have just a
B	yeah
A	chicken salad I love chicken salad
B	well I have that
A	oh okay
B	we have a chicken salad yeah
A	did you not have anything at nan?
B	oh yeah I had something at lunchtime we didn't have any
A	oh I see
B	breakfast I just had a small
A	yeah
B	meal with nan and I had one of your tubes of Smarties to keep me going
A	oh
B	before I went off on my bike
A	I was really naughty today
A	and I was like I am not waiting in this bollocks am I
B	they're British they're British
A	yeah
B	they just tut tutted you
A	they probably did but I didn't care I was like I have to get I have to get back to Newcastle have a shower and then get on the half past five train I am not waiting in that queue
B	how far out of Newcastle was it then?
A	South Shields?
B	oh right
A	so it was quite far
B	yeah
A	well thirteen miles apparently
B	yeah yeah yeah
B	yes it's not a loop then you run from
A	no no you run
B	Newcastle to South Shields
A	yeah
B	and you have to get back
A	yeah
B	oh right
A	yeah the Metro was having a real problem they were having real issues with the Metro today so I don't know if it's normally like that bad but today it was horrendous
B	wouldn't have thought so
A	yeah and like the problem was like this the the Metro had to move to a station and it couldn't move on till the train in front of it had moved on from the next station so it was just this massive this really bad staggered process so
B	oh right
A	we'd er be waiting at stations for about five ten minutes at a time
B	oh so they cocked up
A	yeah
B	I mean it just be difficult I mean you
A	oh yeah with that many people
B	no I mean you've been to Twickenham on the tube and
A	oh yeah true yeah
B	you know and that's
A	a pain in the arse as well
B	yeah that's all everybody's all crammed up together
A	yeah
B	I never like doing that at all
A	no
B	I'd rather drive and wait in a carpark than try and go on the tube I didn't enjoy that
A	I've been on the the few times I've been on the tube it's been okay but it's because after the match we've normally gone somewhere afterwards for a drink just to let
B	probably
A	everything go down
B	that takes a long time to get down though doesn't it that tube?
A	mm yeah
B	so like we waited a long time and I
A	oh shit
B	but they
A	yeah
B	on a Saturday night
A	yeah so dad have you got your rugby tickets ready?
B	for what?
A	the world cup I was taking the piss dad
B	no haven't got any
A	that's neither have I
A	eighty-five to two hundred and fifty pounds for a shit ticket to see two crappy teams play each other he was like that's not the point you're a rugby player you're a rugby supporter
B	no
A	so you should be involved and like
B	no
A	no no no I am not gonna be mugged off
B	I'm a
A	yeah
B	you know
A	yeah
B	it's like it's like it's like
A	I don't even care about
B	you could book a ticket to watch it on the big screen at
A	oh dad why aren't we there?
A	but how was oh how was
B	fine your mother thought he was better than
B	cos he
A	give you an in depth description of how his ear was cleaned out?
B	well
A	he normally does
B	it's how everything gets cleared out
B	er er so we struggled to find the printing works but we found it in the end and when you found it you can understand why you'd struggled to find the printing works
A	oh okay
B	anyway the bloke in charge er it was a letterpress printer which is
A	oh okay
B	er so it you have to set each letter
A	oh god
B	and
A	yeah cos he worked on the newspapers didn't he?
B	and yeah and and this bloke was just doing it so that all your letters are up your your upper case are in the casements obvious why it's called
A	mm
B	upper case the one in the bottom are called lower case they're all positioned as so well ones you use more often are close together
A	yeah
B	yeah? but of course they're in reverse
A	oh yeah
B	so when you set type up you have to set the word up in reverse and all the letters are reversed and this bloke could just do it like this
A	yeah
B	you know I'll just set up today's date for you he said and then you can and there it was and the things like mind your Ps and Qs comes from the fact that P and Q looked very similar
A	and they had to be reversed
B	and they had to be reversed
A	yeah
B	and you think how they ever bothered to print stuff but and and every letter had to be you know typed and they had some real they had six point
A	yeah
A	ah
B	and this well of course we still use the word point don't we and font and all those words?
A	yeah
B	and he said we found these recently upstairs and he said and they were wooden blocks and he said there was two or three of each one he said and we we couldn't quite work it out he said so we started stamping he said and then we realised that one was the letter one was the italic version and one and the others were the were the shadow
A	oh wow okay
B	of what now these were wooden large wooden blocks
A	yeah
B	that people must so he said we've started using them he said to to show it and and they they used them for one of their calendars that they were trying to do
A	oh so grandad liked that then?
B	oh yeah it's er sorts of machines he hadn't used for thirty years
B	you know and there he was explaining the minutiae of them this bloke said this is a nineteen sixty-five machine I said so and he said nineteen eighty er
A	yeah
B	everything was picked up by
B	by a bit of suction flicked over a but no it was a Heidelberg from eighteen er nineteen sixty-five
A	oh
B	and this was a really whizzy machine and it's
A	wow
B	predominantly small run stuff specialist
A	yeah
B	small run stuff for other people
A	did you see the erm Tour de France?
B	no
A	oh
B	this it took us so long to get well to get to the
A	yeah
B	but we got there half tennish rather than ten o'clock
A	yeah
B	then we were in there for an hour and a half
A	yeah
B	past but but going back north again I decided not to try and catch it in
A	yeah
B	and it was very wet yesterday morning anyway when we got to
A	yeah it was a bit wet in Newcastle as well
B	so it wouldn't have been particularly enjoyable er so on the way back we stopped at the first pub we came to
A	yeah
B	for lunch
A	yeah
B	and there was a lady there playing on her computer and yes they were open the whole time there we were the only people that went in that pub
A	oh god
B	three of us it was really weird
A	what was the food like?
B	excellent
A	oh
B	absolutely excellent she cooked three meals plus starters your mother as usual had a starter and then didn't finish her main course you know
B	fucking and er
A	mm that's good did you see
B	no they're in Spain
A	oh okay
B	but er he was a bit miffed that they hadn't offered him the football tickets
A	oh what twats
B	cos I could have well I presume that they give them to
A	you just oh I just hate them
B	so we had to go back into
A	yeah
B	and he had to walk back to the first church was like a bit of a
A	oh what was it? open studio no?
B	it well it er well it wasn't open studios it was open buildings which was but
A	oh yeah yeah
B	no no but it was a church you know they have they they use the church
A	yeah yeah
B	you know so the first one was a
A	oh bless him
B	so anyway I stuck him in the car with a packet of Minstrels for his sugar
A	left him there
B	left him there went back got your mother and said don't
A	was he alright though after his fall?
B	yeah he seemed he didn't go down heavy
A	no
B	he just missed his footing and he I heard him shout before long before he hit the floor
A	yeah
B	he sort of sat himself down
A	oh yeah it was really sad in the erm train station on Saturday morning this man stepped out of this the coffee area and didn't realise there was step and just
B	yeah
A	collapsed on the floor
B	yeah
A	and then like and his drink went everywhere and I helped him up and this other guy came and helped him up but it's weird how like some people react and some people just stare
B	yeah
A	and you're just like
B	yeah
A	try to
B	mm
A	that's good
B	did a bit of printing and what have you and but you've gotta find things that
A	will interest him
B	yeah you know I don't go there for my benefit although it's it's not that it's uninteresting so
A	no but
[ANNOTATION]	5 people were just staring the man that passed out.	Neutral
B	I mean in two weeks' time there's another air show I think but
A	oh right
B	which we'll try and fit I think there's an air show coming up erm we'll try and fit one in for him so yeah erm
A	mm
B	well it's difficult to find things in the winter
A	and it's basically cos you've got to sit outside so
B	yeah well that was the problem with Tour de with with the tour you know
A	yeah
B	you it says well they're gonna be here the the the the road's closed twenty minutes before they come through
[ANNOTATION]	It's easy sitting outside during winter.	Contradiction
A	mm
B	well you can more or less know when they're gonna come through in
A	yeah
B	but you can't guess er two hours later because you don't know what the gap is so
A	yeah
B	so there could be er they could be either nor there the cars could be either here nor there and it it was harder to organise I've never really tried to do it so I just gave up I didn't even bother
A	how was the weather
B	it was
[ANNOTATION]	The weather was really windy.	Neutral
A	was the weather good today?
B	yeah we were on an open top bus
A	yeah
B	and we arrived at the bus stop and erm there was a peculiar see and anyway the some people had pre booked and I mean that well
A	yeah so why did you have an open top bus tour of
[ANNOTATION]	The open top bus was fully booked.	Neutral
B	yeah well it was open
A	oh okay as well
B	in
A	okay that makes more sense I just thought
B	yeah so we had this to go round and show you round places in
B	so we were downstairs and then we got there and when we came back at half past ten erm she was fannying around well some people haven't turned up so if we put people on the top they might have to come down again so we'll wait till half ten anyway we got up on the top and then he said some people then turned up who had
A	pre booked
B	they'd pre booked so they wanted to but
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B and his/her company had to wait until 11 o'clock until they'd go to the top of the bus.	Contradiction
B	so so we stood up to go back down and the bloke said well we can squeeze her in at the back there look er and you sit down there mate you you'll you'll be okay
A	yeah
B	and you
A	she's like
B	so so this
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B and his/her company eventually went downstairs in the top bus.	Contradiction
A	she's an eighty odd year old woman bless her
B	so this this couple a lady and her daughter
A	mm
B	kicked us out of our our seats
A	mm
B	me and mother
B	you know no sort of oh bloody hell
A	yeah
B	and then a family this this lad they had a young kid and the kid just didn't wanna do it
A	oh
B	so was he got on the top of the bus and thought that no I don't wanna do this so they got off so that alleviated all the problems
A	kids are
B	and there was er a bloke doing a rather dry droll talk as we went round er an hour and twenty minutes going round
A	mm
B	places we hadn't all around the jewellery quarter round
A	mm
B	bits and bobs on there that I didn't I'd never been round most of the most of the tour so it certainly wasn't wasted
A	that's cool
B	parts of it were shit
B	so
A	it's
B	then you see the
A	of course part of it's crap
B	you you see the backs of these places and good god you know
B	and then it's you know it it's and you I wouldn't say he was well the point I haven't been on a bus trip
A	mm
B	and you don't go down roads on boat trips so
A	well no obviously dad
B	so so the number of things you see you've got longer to explain what they are
A	yeah so
B	because
A	obviously on a bus
B	you've got
A	you've got less time yeah
B	on a bus you're closer to it
A	yeah
B	there's a blue plaque here in the right hand side which da-di-da and that
A	and it's gone past yeah
B	that's it
A	yeah
B	and so it it's it you cover an awful lot in an hour and twenty minutes
A	mm
B	but you don't cover it in an awful lot of detail
A	detail yeah
B	er so the technique of doing it is is just entirely different it I
A	yeah
B	go into depth about you know
B	oh it was surprising how er
A	so not
B	which
A	particularly useful but
B	which he
A	would be
B	which he told me yes you know and he he was very pleasant it it wasn't the easiest of things to hear but it wasn't like you just would have got used to it after a while
A	mm
B	and an open top bus is the
A	yeah of course yeah
B	but you've got a good view from the open topped bus and the weather was
A	yeah the weather was good today
B	it was er it was a bit blowy so that was alright
A	it was really hot er really hot running this morning
B	oh right
A	be drenched in water
A	obviously that's what a shower does but yeah
B	oh I
A	people did collapse
B	yeah they people have died on you know this erm this erm stupid London hundred mile cycle they do?
A	oh yeah
B	they
A	oh my god
B	and
A	yeah there were loads of like signs and stuff being like the weather is hot don't push yourself and stuff like that but erm there's like these ultra marathons you know like in the deserts and stuff and you're just like god
B	oh I know
A	why why would you do that?
B	I thought
A	I think it has
B	well it obviously hasn't they're all open
A	well maybe it's shutting maybe it's closing down I don't know
A	as our conversation the other day dad I we none of us really know anything about the pubs in
B	I wouldn't waste my time on
B	you know if I were a pub connoisseur
A	a pub reviewer
B	yeah there was loads of people this place the er the
A	it's cos it's
B	yeah
A	don't want like
B	arty crafty sort of the this time of
A	there's a there there's certain type of person who likes arty art like that
B	and also they might they might buy the coming coming up to Christmas mightn't they?
A	mm
B	but they ain't gonna buy them in bloody summer are they? so buying bits of veg and
A	what she was like rude about what you did?
B	no but she obviously didn't know
A	it's like cloned animal meat we were talking cos like what was it? two or three years ago they cloned meat and said they would would people eat it? well they cloned the animal and then ate
B	yeah
A	the meat and people were like oh I wouldn't eat cloned meat
A	and they were just it was just like you don't even understand what you're arguing about
B	but potatoes are cloned
A	yeah
B	apples are all clones
A	yeah it's so stupid
B	they don't just don't understand what they're talking about
A	and it's like GM food people are just like yeah but genetically modified stuff is bad I'm like okay so say hypothetically they had a gene they could extract a gene from a human that would stop them from getting cancer would you not want them to do it? and they're like
