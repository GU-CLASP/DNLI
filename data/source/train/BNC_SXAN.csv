A	right
B	can't officially drive for another twenty-six hours
A	right
B	so there you are
A	so erm
B	oh it's a bit longer than that I went in at about twenty to three
A	right
B	but it did numb the eye and the top of my head I went to scratch the top of my head afterwards and I thought it's gone
A	no
B	and erm all you see is a light shining in your bad eye
A	yeah
B	and you can see movement or stuff coming towards it and going away but you can't make out any details and there's no pain or discomfort even
A	right
B	they're remarkable
A	right right and what's your vision like today in that eye?
B	it er better than it's been for a long long time
A	really?
B	mm
A	really?
B	yeah
A	so you were telling me on the way here what can you can and can't do
B	I can't drive as I said for another day
A	yeah
B	erm
A	right
B	but I've got a son to do that anyway
A	yeah
B	er
A	right
B	nothing else just you know be sensible
A	right okay
B	mustn't rub it obviously
A	oh of course yeah
B	and I've got to wear a a plastic lens to stop me rubbing it inadvertently overnight
A	right right
B	and that's
A	sticky tape is it?
B	with sticky tape
A	yeah
B	and I woke up just before I got up and I thought oh it's gone
A	yeah
B	I felt around and I couldn't find it
A	yeah
B	and when I saw the wife cos she always er gets up very early she said you lost your eye patch in the night I said yeah I know I did she said I saw something glinting on my arm and it was stuck to it
B	I said well what are you trying to do to me in the night?
B	she says no I'm more like the other way round but I have no recollection
A	no recollection of it at all
A	oh dear it's funny I I I remember years ago I had to wear a brace at night you know when I was a kid
B	yeah
A	to keep my teeth straight
B	yeah
A	and it was always the other side of the room in the morning and I couldn't understand how it got the other side of the room
B	no
A	erm but erm you know that there you go
B	strange well
A	it is strange
B	it's not only humans that move around in the night dogs do as well
A	oh do they?
B	yeah because when I or a few years ago I had terrible sciatica and I couldn't lie down and I spent night after night sitting sleeping in the chair
A	right
B	and the two dogs were there and the number of times I woke up and they were on the move
A	were they?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	and they sleep on that they've got a big bed in the kitchen they sometimes sleep on that
A	yeah
B	they're going backwards and forwards and then they they go to sleep on the on the floor they're er quite remarkable
A	really?
B	yeah
A	goodness
B	yeah
A	er our dog never seemed to he always slept on his bed erm well when I saw him erm he didn't like being woken up in the night
B	no
A	erm

A	yeah
B	he's a Labrador quite big
A	yeah
B	and his jowls flop open so his teeth are sticking up in the air
B	and then four legs in the air
A	wow
B	and he's got teeth out of all proportion to his size
A	has he?
B	he's got huge teeth yeah
A	right right
A	tell me I've been meaning to ask you did you find your erm brass plaques?
B	no I didn't
A	no well I'm sorry I failed you but I had a look
B	that's alright
A	I thought about them in the night and erm
B	yes
A	er
B	yeah there's there's one not far from the green baize
A	really?
B	mm
B	I mean the green baize is
A	yeah
B	and he's thirty-four years old now and he won't get rid of it
A	right
B	never used disconnected from everything
A	right
B	on its end
A	right
B	but that the that's a an old door plus an extension
A	yeah
B	covered in green baize with all the
A	right
B	the
A	right
B	and that is behind the computers there are two computers on a stand and I thought no it can't be behind there there's not enough room but I'm sure they're in that room somewhere but it's
A	right
B	er jokingly called a third bedroom
A	right
B	you know it it's
A	right
B	cupboard bigger than that bedroom
A	right oh I see
B	so I'm sure yeah but there is a big white plastic thing on top of there
[ANNOTATION]	The cupboard is smaller than the room.	Contradiction
A	right right
B	a cupboard
A	right
B	and it's full of well what I call junk and
A	oh right I see
B	in fact I don't very often don't use a work as polite as that but erm
B	I think I have I can't recall it but there's yes I think I have
A	and cheese that's gets left around a long time and not used
[ANNOTATION]	The cupboard is purple.	Neutral
B	well it walks out doesn't it?
A	it walks out exactly erm and it's erm so we often say there's a lot of old cheese in the attack we
B	yeah
A	we're always saying things like that
B	I'm not as polite as that
A	you're not no
B	no as you've heard this morning I forgot you were here sorry about that
A	no I didn't even hear you erm I'm I I swear myself I went to drama school years ago
B	yeah
A	and we did a lot of swearing because we had to swear on stage
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A doesn't know how to act.	Entailment
B	yeah
A	so you know you you you just tended
B	well
A	to to carry on swearing erm so getting back to this
B	yeah
A	but then I saw the tank
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A used obscene words.	Entailment
A	the other night so if
A	you ever get in there you might find it
B	I'm looking for them is that
A	yes
B	got them
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A doesn't know how a tank looks like.	Contradiction
A	yeah
B	he can have them
A	oh that's so kind of you
B	but I couldn't find them
A	he's desperate for them
B	yeah
A	a a box full of er of horse brasses
B	yeah
A	he looks in there
B	he did give me a list I don't promise I've got them and the chances are I haven't but ah there it is
A	do you you everyone gets the same at these rallies don't they?
B	yes
A	they're not
B	but
A	different for different
B	I've been going to rallies long before I finished the erm the traction engines
A	right
B	because I don't know whether you remember
A	no
B	he used to go along to rallies with a tableful of hot air engines and I used to tag along with him and I had a couple of stationary engines that I used to run on a little fridge
A	mm
B	mid eighties
A	right
B	so it's possible I've got something he's after but I won't know till I find them
A	no no I see oh well
B	I mean I've started saying to rallies now they they put on do you want a plaque? and I always put no cos
A	yeah
B	I dunno what to do with them
A	no no exactly exactly erm well that's that's right I mean erm
B	yeah
A	have them there
B	yeah
A	on show
B	yeah
A	that's that's the plan anyway
B	mm
A	erm so erm how are we doing?
B	the only one plaque I've got on my
A	yeah
B	a bad day of steaming is better than a good day at work
A	right
B	and on the back of it that
B	something like that
B	don't remember exactly
A	yeah erm can you describe what they're doing behind us? cos that'll be quite interesting
B	well
A	for the tape
B	your husband
B	persuaded the contractors that are building the estate over in the distance
A	yeah
B	to come along and scrape some turf for us so we can create a road
A	right
B	and they piled it up and those lads are shifting the spoil
A	oh right
B	and taking it down to the bottom where the railway goes in a loop and the the embankment needs reinforcing
A	right
B	so that's exactly what they're doing
A	right
B	and most unfortunately in my delicate state I can't help them
A	I know I know
A	that's such a shame isn't it?
B	oh I feel so terrible about it
B	no that
A	yeah
B	and stuff yeah
A	and I said well you mustn't let him I said
A	and I said
B	oh I should be alright next

B	mm
A	bulldozer did he tell you this?
B	yeah
A	and he
B	yeah
A	thought you'd call in so he did yesterday afternoon and they did it and which was great
B	yeah
A	I mean but it was all a bit
B	certainly was
A	erm yeah
B	yeah
A	it was all a bit er ad hoc but
B	yeah
A	erm they're so close aren't they?
B	oh yes

A	right yeah
B	erm your average car you're lucky to do about sort of
A	well absolutely erm I couldn't I mean I've got that small smart car I couldn't tow anything behind that that's not a car it's more of a pet
B	yes
B	what strikes me with those is how expensive they are for what you get
A	yes but not if you
B	oh
A	oil leak
B	ah
A	erm and I just keep topping up the oil
B	mm
A	I I love old I love cars I love trying cars out and that car is a brilliant little car to drive

A	right
A	right
B	old Land Rover
A	right
B	I don't know what to do with it whether to keep it another two or three years it's going to be tax exempt
A	oh right

A	right
B	but at the moment it's got no road tax and it's it's sorned and it's out of MOT as well
A	how old is it?
B	it's nineteen seventy-eight

A	it's the same colour as the
B	I think it was done with that in mind to merge everything in
A	yeah exactly to make everything look
B	yeah
A	a bit
B	yeah
A	cohesive really but then they went for these erm bright blue railings didn't they?
B	why lord only knows
A	yeah yeah

A	oh is it?
B	yeah it's
A	doesn't seem to have anything any feeding er
B	the only reason it's still there no it hasn't is that we don't want to cause offence to the person who constructed it
A	oh right
B	erm it's never been used
A	right
B	it hasn't got a er there's a screw on lid in there somewhere
A	right
B	but we don't put it on because the kids climb up it and use it as a Frisbee
