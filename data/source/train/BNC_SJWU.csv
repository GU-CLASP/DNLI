B	yeah
A	yeah
B	well if we could share shall we share this first one
A	okay
B	right where's the little glasses?
A	the Chinese think of everything
A	but we're not Chinese
A	it's a Goon Show thing
B	is it?
A	I wouldn't expect you to appreciate it
B	no no well I wasn't middle middle class upbringing was it?
A	yes you did
B	didn't
A	yep
B	alright well I extra extra top middle class if you're gonna be watching things like the fricking Goon Show
A	firstly it's a radio show so you don't watch it
A	secondly I'm I'm sorry that appreciating good comedy means your upper middle class
A	just uncultured
B	we were watching we were we were watching lower class comedy like Some Mothers Do Ave Em
A	that's what uncultured people say
B	mm
A	yeah my mum did a bit
B	did she?
A	yeah well I mean I've seen it
A	I I hated it
A	er it's the worst kind of comedy
B	I thought it was quiet funny
A	no okay I mean that that was a bit harsh there were
B	the one with the er the one with you know scene the scene with the roller boots
A	do you want some of the extra bits?
B	can't beat that
A	mm don't know that one
B	I get it gets
A	I just don't like the kind of calamity comedy whatever you know like oh no he's done it it's all going wrong and then the catchphrases come out and
B	yeah no it's it's crap
A	catchphrase stuff it can be it can be good but
B	yeah
A	I think the catchphrase itself has to start off being
B	you're saying that ooh Betty was not the best catchphrase in the world?
A	he had a few didn't he?
B	I think it was mainly ooh Betty
A	was it?
B	and a few you know
A	what were the yeah what were his other catch?
B	I don't remember any more I think that was it
A	and who came up with that one? ooh Betty
B	well it's his wife's name
A	no I
A	no
A	I'd say you're up to about fifteen minutes
B	no
A	that log is a big
B	surely that would last us the evening?
A	no
B	really? not even me big log?
A	no
B	yep
A	for a year you'd need about four metres squared area of wood
B	erm
A	so imagine
A	yes so
B	hang on so hang on a minute hang on a minute hang on a minute hang on a minute oh so is that so is that two by two cubed?
A	so if you imagine two
A	four sorry four cube metres sorry my wrong
B	four cube metres so is that a two by two by two?
A	yeah two by two by two so imagine like a pokey bedroom two metres by two metres
B	yeah
A	full of wood
B	and that can gives us what? well how many yeah but how many is occasional fires?
A	if you do every night
B	mm
A	pretty much
B	no no no no no never mind that you've got to define occasional fire so
A	I I don't know
B	I know I know but I mean basically you can knock out kind of March to October say
A	he said like on chilly summer evenings
B	you won't have a frigging fire on chilly summer evening that's ridiculous
A	no actually no that was for using it every day
B	well anyway
A	between between that between four and nine
B	no I don't think we you know
A	but I think for us
B	I don't think we'll be using it in the summer
A	no I know that was the occasional use
B	well no but I mean occasional use to me would probably be about twenty a year
A	oh that really is occasional
B	yeah
A	I'd imagine er yeah
B	a hundred a year is mental we'd never have that many
A	well er
B	yeah well they they're yeah but it's still a novelty for them and they could probably heat the house a bit better with it cheaper than electricity or whatever
A	are we?
B	no I know but what I'm
A	yes I know no okay
B	look that will do an evening
A	it's not going to burn very well anyway even when it's dry
B	it will if it's rotten it'll burn nicely
A	yeah but if you think about it when something rots it loses a lot of its
B	yeah but it's dry it's nice and dry
A	it's not dry
B	it will be
A	oh it will be yeah
B	yeah and then it'll go up nice
A	yeah it'll go up quick and nice
B	yeah
A	we'll get five minutes
A	yep
B	mm
A	erm I'm afraid
B	ah
A	but erm I do think basically what we should do is we should chuck out our wood base
B	yeah
A	erm work out roughly how much space we have
B	yeah quite a bit there yeah a lot there yeah
A	clear it try and and then obviously we'll just stack it up
B	oh no we've got a lot of space there
A	erm I think it'll be really good a really good lot of storage that's right out the back door
B	yeah we've got a lot of space there yeah yeah we've got a lot got a lot of space there and we could put one out the front we could put one out the front as well
A	it would make it look a lot better there as well
B	yeah but we can put one out the front
A	oh I don't know our neighbour might
B	yeah
A	walk off with it
B	yeah you're not kidding he would as well
A	yeah difficult to treat decking isn't it?
B	yeah no it's just difficult to treat decking
A	why didn't we do that? oh we needed to paint it cos
B	well well we had to paint it cos it all got flaky paint on it
A	yeah that's it's a big-sized plot
B	yeah yeah it is
A	I liked it I thought I thought I definitely would have built the house closer to the road
B	yeah yeah you don't need a big drive
A	you don't need all that big garden
B	no no no no no you don't
A	it's the front garden really
B	yeah yeah
A	yeah I need some lime
B	I like I like that got shedloads of limes have we got limes
A	and a lot of fruit
B	yeah they need using up though
A	interesting definition of shed loads
B	well it is three is a lot
A	if you're er if there's three people in a boat and you're dying of scurvy then three limes is probably a life-saver but
B	mm mm wouldn't have thought so I think you might need more
A	although the problem is not scurvy probably doesn't matter does it?
B	don't know
A	or does it reverse?
B	er no I think you can reverse it
A	well I mean you can reverse it cos it's a dish condition you can treat it
B	well no er
A	er what am I in here for?
B	er? limes onion
A	yeah that's all in here oh and er sauce
B	what are we erm having with it rice?
B	oh
A	well we don't have any noodles do we?
B	well it's more that I'm going to have to get up and cook it
A	so we need some wine oh no no no no
B	er yeah what wine?
A	yeah but we were gonna go for another beer
B	yeah
A	erm
B	while you're on your feet go and get another beer
A	indeed
B	I really liked their little bistro set that was really cute for breakfast
A	yeah it was nice that they had their pictures of Greece above it
B	did they?
A	they had those picture up
B	oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	it was nice
B	no it was really sweet
A	I really really liked their house I thought wow I would have
B	yeah yeah yeah yeah absolutely
A	it erm I think they've made a really good move
B	yeah
A	I never saw the upstairs in their old house actually
B	erm
A	yes
B	really nice
A	let's move this over here
A	no
B	oh er
A	yeah
B	cool
A	I think that'd be nice
B	yeah absolutely no I'll do that and
A	glad to hear the timing will be good
B	yeah yep yep
B	only got one coconut milk
A	oh no no no we do yeah
B	oh
A	yeah
A	full fat or half fat?
B	don't mind
A	full fat
B	right
A	given that it's fish
B	erm
A	okay dokey
B	we're happy with that coconut milk aren't we?
A	which one?
B	that one well is that? is it?
A	yeah the erm it's good
B	I wonder how much it is
A	it's like about eighty P
B	is it?
A	so it's really cheap
B	we ought to buy big then won't we?
A	yeah I'd buy buy like twelve or something
B	well may as well buy a year's supply
A	I suspect quite a while I think a tin lasts for a while
B	there you go we'll get an apocalypse an apocalypse level of coconut milk
A	absolutely
B	fifty-two
B	we could get through one a week
A	one a week fifty-two
B	well actually no this is about it's about half a week so we need twenty-five to get us through a year
A	get twenty-five then
B	I will I'll get twenty I'll get twenty
A	a years' supply sort of thing you win in a competition
B	a years' supply of coconut milk
A	yes twenty-five cans that would be a really
B	well that's it like grandad got his years' supply of whisky but I don't know how much it was but he got through it I three months so I mean it was obviously not really a years' supply
A	did he?
B	yeah
A	you'd you'd think you'd think it would have to be based on like they just keep giving it to you for a whole year until
B	yeah well they can't what if they get a proper alky? it's not responsible is it? mind you back then
A	well then that person has a
B	but I'd have thought what would you
A	I mean a years' supply of a ten-year-old would be well none you know they wouldn't drink it
B	yeah
A	so what's official a years' supply?
B	a
A	twelve bottles?
B	no it can't be you can't be
A	a bottle a month?
B	yeah I suppose yeah twelve bottles then
A	quarter of a bottle a week is what
B	god
A	er seven what how is it a litre a standard or is it seven fifty?
B	er no it's seven fifty
A	so then you know
B	yeah I suppose
A	which is like four doubles a week
B	no it's not much at all
A	well that's the other thing isn't it? it would last us a while cos we don't really
B	yeah yeah yeah yeah that's your tipple yeah yeah yeah yeah that's your tipple
A	tipple of choice
B	I guess it probably it's about the only thing he could taste as well
A	why did he have a taste problem?
B	couldn't taste anything
A	oh really
B	couldn't smell anything couldn't smell lost his sense of smell in the war got some sort of
A	from an injury?
B	no no no from erm I think it was like a bug you know
A	bloody hell really?
B	yeah
A	you'd really you really only appreciate what you have when you've
B	well
A	sense of smell's one of those things you probably just I remember when I lost my sense of smell for a couple of weeks it was really weird
B	yeah yeah yeah it was rubbish yeah
A	it it but it was just I mean I I think
B	yeah
A	like they don't they don't come back but it wasn't it wasn't a massive one
B	no
A	I sort of thought that would be a pain but oh well
B	it would be a pain I mean put it like this it would be life would be cheaper cos you wouldn't you you you wouldn't bother with wine
A	but
B	yeah
A	it's not like acid levels it's not that
B	no I mean like for for me I'd just eat lots of fruit and veg cos I wouldn't be able to taste
A	it would be a shame wouldn't it?
B	it it would be a shame I wouldn't need chocolate any more I'd be the healthiest person ever
A	I don't know now you see because no you see cos you still get that reward from chocolate even if you don't taste it
B	no you're not gonna bother no no no
A	no you do yeah you would
B	no no no
A	okay just
B	no I know but the reward you get from chocolate is nowhere near the level of reward you get from having a fag
A	no but you can get a little bit of a like after a meal it makes you feel right even if you've not tasted it
B	no no bullshit no if you can't taste it it's worthless
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A doesn't like that he/she doesn't taste the food	Contradiction
A	oh no
B	no and it doesn't and and in fact it
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B thinks that it wouldn't; be a shame	Entailment
A	what do you?
B	what's the point? there's no there's no reward?
A	well that okay but I could taste it on my tongue but I suppose maybe your grandad had lost his tongue taste
B	mm no no basically the only things he could really properly taste were stem ginger
A	talking of which
B	uhu yeah ginger
A	we don't have any do we?
B	yeah we've got loads of ginger
A	is that?
B	yeah
A	is it?
B	yeah it's sprouting
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker's A grandpa had corona and he couldn't taste anything	Neutral
A	where?
B	down
A	down down
A	kneel down
B	do you think we can grow it?
A	what? I don't think we need to it's doing it by all by itself
B	no but like I wonder if you can grow ginger or whether you need erm
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B is wondering whether you can grow ginger or you have to buy it	Neutral
A	I dunno
B	a root
A	oh I'm not I'm just trying to cut around it
B	what?
A	what bit?
B	I know well you've just flapped this flap that's not gonna do it any good is it?
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A makes an effort to cut around it	Entailment
A	erm I dunno
B	it looks very keen to grow and it was growing in the dark
A	yeah well
B	I suppose it just grows through the ground yeah I know but I've never had it grown before but then we've never kept it that long before
A	you're you're definitely not gonna be team botanist in an apocalypse movie
B	what?
A	I know but well clearly you possibly don't
B	I think I do I beg to differ
A	well you only just worked out that the reason why it sprouts in the dark is because it's when you're underground it's dark
B	yeah alright I know you chuck potatoes in the dark as well but
A	oh I see now you're just showing off
B	mm
A	put all the ginger in
B	mm
B	well it's food
A	it's just done in
B	ah sorry yeah I've bought loads more leeks again they're just on such good value at the moment
A	it's fine leeks good
B	I don't know you I don't think you can beat an onion
A	well I regret cutting off a very big piece of ginger
A	it's one of those things that people always say I'm sure it's right but
B	it's gotta be good for colds everyone says it
A	everyone says it's good for you
B	yeah
A	what are we watching tonight?
B	don't know
A	I think probably not House of Cards
B	no
A	we're on a new disc now
A	I know but lots of things are popular and people don't get round to watching them
B	it doesn't matter we've got it now
A	I know it doesn't matter I know
A	we should have done Scarlet's Sword
B	yeah
A	I know but how much did we played it in the last

A	no it's without skin
B	Alaskan
B	have you?
A	yeah
B	well how big was it?
A	don't laugh
A	it was about four and a half pounds
B	oh that's ridiculous
A	it was alright
B	I've caught
A	I was little it was about half the size of me
B	ah that's little I've caught bream in a canal that was four and a half pounds
A	alright
A	yeah
B	god
A	well
B	hi my name's
A	well look
B	well it's four bags of sugar
A	phwoar
B	phwoar
A	pull that out of the sea when you're about eight
A	thing is a lot of the fishing that I've done has been sort of fishing
A	yeah like you know?
B	I've never seen you catch a fish that's
A	I know that's because of the lengths I fish in
B	mm
A	I no
B	it was three nibbles or something wasn't it?
A	I'll tell you what I did get yeah I got a couple of nibbles and a couple of risers and erm
B	yeah
A	I did I did better than them
B	maybe it was just not quite the right time of year
A	it was nice weather though
B	yeah but it was so cold at night
A	well the conditions weren't great I mean you don't want to go fishing when it's
A	yeah exactly
B	I don't know
A	will improve things
B	maybe that's what we should do as our as our old age pensioners we should do fishing that could be an activity for us
A	sounds good
B	walking and fishing
A	nothing better than that
B	it would be it could get better than that if we weren't doing it in the UK
A	if you end up at a pub at the end of the day
B	but we were walking fishing somewhere warm
A	yeah but then
B	now you're talking
A	the thing is
B	yeah
A	yeah in some other places but
B	the continent
B	yeah
A	beautiful but not that warm
B	yeah I was thinking maybe Sweden
A	well
B	mm
A	what about the UK when it's warm?
B	yeah but it's not always reliably warm is it? whereas I think Sweden gets many weeks of very hot weather
A	I don't know depends what you mean
B	well they get they get proper hot weather there they get like you know
A	do they?
B	er I think so
A	well I
B	well they get they get no they get proper no no well no no I think every every year they get proper summer holiday weather
A	do they?
B	yeah
B	I think so
A	I quite like them in a curry
B	yeah that's fine I'm just wondering what they're doing hanging out on that plate?
A	well they're they're not gonna go they're not quite in yet
B	right okay
A	so they they're like they're the kind of the skins keep them oops
B	mm
A	ooh that looks a bit
B	badly very badly have we got some in the fridge? you're on your feet you have a look
A	have we got some in the fridge?
B	no there's a white in the open in the fridge
