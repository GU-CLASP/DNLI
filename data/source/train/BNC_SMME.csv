C	mm
A	it's like one percent or something it's really good
C	mm

A	and I bought some flat pods and they looked like black trainers
C	ah nice
A	yeah they were great
C	love it
B	all us kids used to rebel on trainers at school and we used like black Reebok Classics
A	yeah
B	like pure black and even if there was a little bit of colour on them we'd just colour them in
A	mm
B	it was great great
A	that was awful like we
B	it wasn't very comfy
A	even in sixth form we had to wear a uniform
C	nice
A	maroon blazer
C	yum
A	so that's nice
C	I used to have to wear that when I was doing security
A	and then in the sixth form we wore black
C	okay well at least you looked different then
A	with the same tie which was a bit shit but
C	mm
A	black blazer black trousers
C	oh okay
A	so I thought I was cool
C	nice
A	em and a fitted shirt which were banned and a black kind of big knit cardy with holes in so you could see my shirt through it that kind of wrapped round and yeah I thought it was great
C	for sure
A	Don't know why I did that really but apparently I thought it was important at the time
A	and my new school handbag
C	oh I was that was the best thing though wasn't it? Like in August going shopping for your new shoes
A	did you? I used I had shoes from Shoe Shoe shoes
C	that's
B	I used to look forward to getting a new rucksack
C	new school bag
B	yeah
C	I used to ram my

C	like in the beginning of school I used ram it full of stuff
B	yeah
C	and like almost break it carrying everything I owned in it
A	I used to have those handbags from Kookai or from Morgan
C	yeah
B	all the girls used to do that they'd come in with loads of bags like that
C	there was a particular style wasn't there?
A	yeah
B	especially on a Friday going round for a sleepover and there'd be girls like coming in with like literally like they'd just been shopping on a Friday morning
C	sleepovers
B	yeah
C	oh I love a sleepover
B	yeah slumber party
A	we were actually horrendous
C	ah
A	pull out some clothes and shove them on
C	Jesus
A	and every bank holiday
C	you're animals
A	to work at the call centre was the time so
C	nice
A	you know at seventeen twenty pounds an hour was fucking awesome
C	yeah
A	em so we used to not go home get to the call centre and work a thirteen hour shift so be sat there at seven in the morning pissed as a fart trying to manage a team of ten
C	oh man alive
A	yeah
C	that's pretty bad
A	yeah
C	mm
A	and the the managers used to let us leave stuff in there like if we'd go straight from school to work and then straight from work out on bank holiday
C	mm
A	they'd let us leave our stuff in their cupboards and lock it for us
C	really?
A	yeah
C	oh god
A	the entire way probably four lengths of this house
C	ah
A	I see her out of the corner of my eye walk through we used to work for The National Rail walk through get to a seat plop herself down and I looked at her and she looked at me and as she looked forward and she kind of spun
C	aw
A	and she looked at her computer and just went dooosh and smacked her head on the desk and passed out
A	wheeled her to the nearest
C	that's
A	oh I'd forgotten that
C	that's that's actually genius isn't it really? Cos you can't lift a dead weight
B	no no
C	just wheel it
A	they dosed her up with coffee for an hour
C	at least she wouldn't feel it cos if she was that pissed she wouldn't have felt it
A	so not only did she get wheeled out of work smack her face on a desk smack her face on the bus some kid like three four year old got up and stamped on her fingers
C	stamped on her hands
A	we did all sorts We did all sorts
B	if you can get away with it yeah
A	they didn't sack anyone
C	even still though
A	so high
C	like I'm sure that's probably a sackable offence turning up pissed you know instant dismissal like no warnings
A	yeah
C	mm
A	A couple of days a week
C	oh god and they were all in the same place?
A	yeah it was huge
C	mm
A	and spend eight weeks training again
C	yeah
A	so
C	yeah
A	so in the end it was quite difficult to get sacked
C	mm
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	it all depends on what
C	well it has been done and it will it will I mean I couldn't do it now
B	oh
C	because I had to go to work and I had the hangover hat

A	and basically we can sell the whole space for twelve grand
C	mm mm
A	she sold it half capacity and promised it them exclusively and I said to her no
C	mm mm
A	they could have one room exclusively and then we can only lose kinda twenty percent
C	yeah

A	and the best part is usually in the hotels the other people that do her job look after a cluster
C	mm hm
A	for a cluster of hotels they'll look after three or four hotels so their key accounts span across the region
C	right
A	and they travel a lot and they work for people but because of our

[ANNOTATION]	The bike has some sick flames on the side.	Neutral
B	I'll have a little look at it tomorrow
C	well don't worry cos especially if it snows

C	yeah because it's cos I can't wheel it
B	you know why you can't wheel it? Well you can wheel it
C	yeah I didn't realise that I could disconnect the brake
B	yeah
C	Cos I basically had to wheel it without it wheeling
B	okay
C	and I was like pissing blood and I was crying
B	fucking hell girl
C	and I looked like such a mess
B	see I knew none of this
C	no
B	I was fuming last week
C	what with me?
B	yeah
C	no I couldn't speak
C	when I came home When I came home on that Tuesday I changed into my joggers and went to my dad's crying
B	yeah
C	I couldn't speak
B	I was fuming last week weren't I?
A	eh you weren't angry when you said that to me
B	well I were I was I was annoyed and frustrated because I thought I was always saying to her you know what's up with
A	and I said nothing I don't know
B	some some something that I've not done
A	and and and he said have I done something? Cos she came in here and she didn't even say hello and I said
C	Cos I couldn't speak
B	I didn't know I didn't even know that
C	I had that
A	and I was like that's not like
C	it's this
B	yeah
C	if I think you have a problem with me you never talk to me about it
B	mm
C	you always talk to
B	mm
C	that frustrates me
A	you like to avoid conflict
B	do you know what? Go on
C	the thing is this this is never gonna to be a conflict
B	I know I
C	well I I find it really embarrassing talking about money
A	yeah I find it embarrassing
C	I think it's really rude
B	yeah
C	if someone had had to say it to me oh well do you want to get some beers from that time that you drank my
B	yeah
C	or whatever whatever the issue is I would rather much you talked to me
A	and I think when you're moving in somewhere like this it's like it's difficult isn't it to know
C	yeah
A	how how much you can say to another person
C	yeah when you don't know them that well
A	cos you go from that
C	you don't know how they're going to take it
A	it's really difficult to get gauge
C	like all day I was like should I say something should I not? And I was really nervous that's why I was like
B	what? About about the beer?
C	yeah yeah yeah
B	when were you when was this? When were you nervous about the beer?
C	when I said to you do you want to get some beers in?
B	what via text message?
C	no no no no
B	oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
C	I was like shall I say something? Should I not? You know it's fine but eh I
B	yeah I I think we knew that I understand that
C	that's why to me like it was really embarrassing having to say
B	yeah
A	mm
C	you drank all my beer so can you get some more in
B	yeah
C	money is just really it's really crude and I don't want to talk about it
B	no
A	I found cos I agree with you on this
B	yeah
A	I'm not talking multi-millionaire he's probably got accumulatively one or two
C	mm
A	not enough to write home about seeing as I'm trying to help him with his frigging divorce
B	mm
C	yeah
A	em but yeah we never ever never talk about money
C	that's what you learn
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	you never ask you never talk about it it's just it's
B	yeah
C	so it's for me it was really like oh my god I was really nervous about it
A	yeah
C	A because I don't know you well enough so I don't know if you're gonna
B	it's only a few beers
C	but do you know
B	angry about it
A	but it doesn't last without you does it?
C	I don't know
B	oh no I know no
C	mm
B	we've all got to muck in together
A	and not everyone's
C	well yeah
B	I'm I'm I'm I'm not bothered about how helping housemates out if I can you know and I well I'm not saying that I expect the same back you know
A	yeah
B	it it happens so you know I'm not
C	yeah
A	mm
B	yeah
A	Anna and Carmen it would be nice if we can include them as well
B	yeah
C	but for me like I just want you to know like if you've got something that's on your mind I'd much rather you talk to me about it
B	yeah
C	because it upsets me and it annoys me to think that you talked to somebody else
B	yeah
C	rather than come to me because then I think that's what breeds anger in the house
B	yeah
A	mm
C	it makes me feel uncomfortable to think you're secretly going and talking about me
A	mm
B	yeah
C	whereas actually you could be like I don't really understand why she did that?
A	you don't know how to judge the situation
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	it's probably just like really harmless
B	well yeah it's it's different cos you know
C	yeah of course yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah cos I said what I said to
B	yeah
A	but if you
B	yeah
A	and it wouldn't matter and I said is what will happen is over the more time it will just become normal
B	yeah
A	and that you won't feel a barrier at all
C	mm
A	it's just really strange like
C	I guess we spend less time less time together
A	that's it it's just a time thing
B	because you know it's it's
C	mm
B	and
C	yeah
A	that's actually probably the time difference you know thinking about it
B	yeah you know it's quite a long time
A	yeah
B	you know it all adds up
C	mm
B	than what you are
A	yeah you you need your own space a bit more
C	mm
B	which is fine which is great you know
C	mm
B	you know I'm probably the same but
A	yeah I
B	just she yeah
C	yeah
B	Cos you know
A	she is a nosy chatterbox
A	as it happens
B	you know
C	I just love living in this house
A	sucking up to
B	no
C	no no me neither I mean the thing is
A	I do
B	oh
C	that I mean that's the defensiveness is a bit of a shame
A	but like that's the thing
C	I don't want her to feel persecuted
A	well yeah
C	mm
A	when I came in drunk singing with
B	yeah
A	I said I said
C	mm
A	and in the morning she brought it up and I said yeah oh no I'm really sorry
B	she stuck her head out did she?
A	yeah
B	oh I didn't know that
A	and had a go and I said I know I'm really sorry I'm going downstairs now I'm really sorry I'm going to bed
C	to plaster even though no one's got a plaster
A	pissed
B	there was plasters where? You've still got them haven't you?
A	yeah in the bathroom yeah
B	yeah it was a couple of days later weren't it?
A	yeah she brought it up again
C	and it has only been once or twice you know like really
A	yeah that's the first time I've ever woken
C	oh really? Okay
A	yeah and she came downstairs and she brought it up again and initially I was going to apologise and I went oh yeah I know
C	eh hmm
A	and I said well yeah but to be fair in the grand scheme of things I've woken you once and I get woken up every
B	mm
A	I think we're on quite a good winner there on your front
C	yeah
A	and that's what pissed me off cos when I brought it up with her when she brought it up with me even though it was just a one off occasion
C	yeah
A	the first thing I did automatically was apologise
B	we'll stick it in the oven now it's on the grill
A	and then we brought it up with her and she didn't
C	no
B	no
A	for the whole conversation she didn't say sorry once
C	and her fella quietly in the corner
A	ran away upstairs
C	yeah
A	this is what I said to
B	mm
C	and it's so hard because the last thing you want to be doing is saying to your housemates you can't have boyfriend over for in the night
A	aw
C	cos I'd been out
A	yeah
A	oh no
C	affects the house
B	yeah
C	which is what we said
B	well yeah sometimes you know like if I've got my window open
C	Cos they said oh it's it's cos you two have got the worst rooms as if it's somehow our fault because we have a room downstairs
B	yeah
C	I said well it wakes everybody up
B	yeah
C	you know
B	yeah
C	 Well
B	yeah
A	and then I said well you know he does make a lot of noise well I don't hear him
C	he wakes us up
A	yeah
C	and then she says
A	but that's not the conversation
C	and she says the reason she couldn't let him out the back door is because she goes back to sleep
A	yeah
C	so she's not got an issue
A	no
C	she goes happily back to sleep and the rest of us have to put up with him banging around the front door
A	yeah and I did say to her like families live together all the time you know parents work nightshifts and stuff and it works and you don't wake each other up because
B	marvellous
C	so I just I just found the whole attitude really strange
B	but I haven't heard him for ages
C	mm
B	no I haven't heard him
A	mm
B	out front
A	I'll tell you what I thought was really spineless of him like he didn't say I'm sorry or I didn't realise I was waking you up
C	yeah right
A	just he just stood there above the stairs like hiding and I mean I know it was an awkward conversation
C	mm
A	it shouldn't have been actually Anna was very immature when she handled that conversation
B	mm
A	she didn't accept responsibility
C	mm
A	passive aggressive really
C	yeah
A	but you would think although he felt awkward he might say do you know what it's actually me that's getting up
B	mm
C	mm
A	that would have been end of convo
B	I don't think it's not that much to ask you know if he leaves his bike out there you know
C	no because
B	yeah
C	so it makes no difference whatsoever
B	yeah
C	no one's gonna rob us between half four and half five
B	no
A	yeah
B	mm
A	they're dirty go ahead
C	disco duck
A	Don't take the disco duck
A	mm
B	yeah it's not a major problem leaving that door open at all
C	it's maximum two hours
A	mm hm
B	yeah
A	I mean to be fair if someone comes in we'd fucking hear him you'd be up
C	mm
B	yeah
C	mm
A	no one's gonna rob you at that time cos they think people are getting up for work
C	mm
B	yeah
A	which we are really so we'd hear them
C	for sure
A	mm
B	we are all early birds it's annoying that you know there's a few people that get up earlier than some which is quite frustrating
C	mm
B	you know
A	especially the weeks when I'm not to be at work till ten
B	mm
A	that's a piss take
C	it's a killer isn't it really? It's so hard because the house is only designed for like what? Three people?
B	yeah
C	it would originally have been a three bedroomed house
A	yeah
C	so maximum
A	mm hm
C	so really to have five adults possibly six seven eight depending on who's staying here
C	yeah
C	there's just too many people for one small space
A	mm
B	completely
A	although I've only ever heard you in the whole time being here I've heard you twice and I've never heard you
C	really?
A	in how many months has that been?
B	that's pretty good going
C	we've been here six months
A	isn't it? That's a pretty good going
B	I do try and be quiet you know even
C	eh hmm
A	I think it was the door that was waking me up you know
C	I've slept so much better this week
A	yeah
C	I don't wake up in the morning now because of that door
A	no
C	so it obviously was the banging that we were hearing
B	mm
A	I don't think I really
C	mm
A	that it was that that was waking me up it obviously was
C	that night when I went mental at you two cos you woke me up the first night second night
A	mm
C	that was the problem
A	oh yes
C	and drank a bottle of wine
A	I remember yeah
C	fucking alcoholic
B	oh yeah
C	well like cos it was because your mate your mate kept going in and out of the kitchen door so in your head you're like that's really good we're keeping the door closed no one will wake up
A	mm
C	because the door's so noisy obviously that's what you hear
B	yeah
C	I think now that we've taken the hinge off
A	yeah
C	which
B	yeah as long as you as long as you keep the the clip in the door
A	ooh and I found out today during my fire safety training she can't kick off to us about taking it off
C	it's illegal to have open anyway isn't it?
A	it's not a fire door It's not a fire door If it was a fire door it should be a heavy duty door and that's just wood
C	not window
A	yeah
C	well the hinge I think might have made it heavy duty
A	oh did it?
B	it's a solid door
C	but the hinge always uses the catch and it was so it made it heavy cos it was a heavy weight
B	no
A	is it?
B	yeah
C	but the thing is she's complicit because she knows that we could
A	no you can't
C	I've never seen I've never seen
A	there's no way cos if it gets hot the glass is going to shatter
B	it's got metal in it
C	it's pretty heavy like if you think about it when you've got the hinge on it
B	it's a proper fire door
C	but the thing is she knows that we've always kept that propped open
A	mm
C	so she really can't complain
B	no
C	to be honest it probably was there when she bought it and she probably doesn't give two hoots
A	yeah
B	and in all fairness if she really wants to get bloody technical that should be
C	when was the last time that was checked?
B	October last year
A	yeah
B	according to this
A	yeah
C	we're definitely dead
B	no yeah sorry
A	oh right
C	two thousand and eleven?
B	yeah
A	ooh
C	right
B	and that
C	is fucked
B	quite clearly
C	I don't
B	I bet you I bet you
A	no
C	well I've I've
B	what the fire panel?
C	yeah
B	why? Did it go off again?
C	no but only me and
A	no
B	it's easy

C	I need to try and turn mine
A	just flip it over it'll be fine
B	oh did you?
C	yeah
A	winner
B	it might just need to tightening up and a few drill holes put in somewhere
C	yeah
A	oh
C	which is fine
A	I think you'll find
C	but I like the you know the bed itself
A	yeah
C	so it's quite deep
[ANNOTATION]	The bed is okay, but a big shallow.	Contradiction
B	but when I move if I move that will go and then I'll just keep the frame and then I'll just get a a nice frame when I find one that's
B	yeah
C	like not two hundred pounds
A	yeah
C	Cos that's how much the foam cost
[ANNOTATION]	The mattress is not cheap at all.	Entailment

C	A week?
B	two weeks
C	two weeks
B	two weeks
A	I mean I understand you have been spending quite a lot of time together
B	it feels it feels
C	it feels longer cos you're seeing her all the time
B	no not only that it's like when we're with each other as well you know it it it feels like we've known each other for years
A	oh
B	which is really really great as far as I'm concerned
C	oh
A	does she dress as cool as I do? Like hip?
B	em
C	no one is as cool as you
B	put it this way
C	you're being so diplomatic
B	put it this way
A	you're telling me I don't look hot in my scrubs? Think very carefully
C	silence
B	but
A	well I think I look hot in my scrubs
B	so you know
C	what's all this carry on this this is this is what I
C	I particularly like this aspect to your
A	man I'm so hot
C	you look like someone's about to hang you up
B	I compliment you
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	so that's okay
A	I mean the best part is that only you lot get to this
C	but to be fair you're in your own home you should be able to get to wear whatever the hell you like
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	and it's not that bad
A	like at work they take the mick when I wore my um cos I got to wear the uniform didn't I? So I wore trousers and a shirt for the first time and everyone went nuts at work
B	uniform
A	suit uniform? Same thing you've got on
C	yeah
A	Cos I'm the only one that wears a dress apart from the receptionist and they have to wear like a long coat over the top
C	oh god
A	em I was like yeah shirt and trousers
B	in all fairness I think it looks better you wearing a shirt and trousers
A	yeah
B	Cos it it gives variety of colour
C	it's more of a uniform as well isn't it?
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	that dress just looks too much of a school girl dress I think
A	oh good
B	personally
A	I call it my granny dress but you call it school girl dress if you like
C	mm
A	it's gonna get
C	ah she's come good then
A	yeah
B	at the end of the day a uniform's a uniform isn't it?
A	yeah
C	well the idea of uniform is that you all look the same whereas you're just rocking out whatever the hell you want to wear
A	yeah
C	eh hmm
A	she was like fine order the dress
C	oh amazing
A	yeah
C	oh
A	it's not the buses though so

B	yeah it's a close up
C	that's another gap
B	that's a that's a big span
C	yeah
B	that's in the back garden
C	that's our back garden? Em
B	it's really weird
C	could be a fox um
A	though we're in a bit of a built-up area to see foxes aren't we?
B	yeah you do get city foxes
C	but they like urban areas don't they cos the bins have got good pickings
A	like she knows it best
C	they like the bins
A	I love Mighty Boosh
C	it gave me fucking nightmares

C	I like limes
A	oh have you seen um
C	it sounds horrendous whatever it is
A	ooh my god
C	salad fingers
