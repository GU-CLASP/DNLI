B	thank you mum it looks nice
C	that's alright erm there's some Knorr Stock Pot
B	no
C	they come in little pots like that and they
B	oh right
C	they've got a lovely flavour do you want me to show you one?
B	mm
C	I'll show you
B	thank you
A	look at that bread
C	got these if you want to get them
B	oh right and they're better are they?
B	mm
B	mm
A	it does
B	you made the bread?
A	yes I did
B	mm
A	yes that is
C	oh is half and half? okay
A	mm the last part it just as I was tipping it in more wholewheat went in last time
C	ah I see
A	so this is actually a bit lighter
C	mm
B	mm lovely nice I like chicken soup
B	why?
B	that's true I don't
C	no
B	mm
C	cos it couldn't be easier could it? to make soup
B	no
C	dad was just saying the chickens that he gets from Waitrose three for ten pounds are actually the sizes are a bit smaller
C	but that's really good cos it means we could just have have it between the two of us
B	that's true
B	it's not natural that chickens are that big either
A	no
C	no
B	they've been too big for years they shouldn't be that size
C	oh right
B	you know they're more than er
B	yes
C	yes
A	yeah
B	in the Middle East they never get very big
B	they're always small
C	mm
B	but I think that's why they
C	oh right
C	yes
B	yeah I always get confused what the difference is
C	shepherd's pie is actually meant
A	lamb
B	oh
C	and cottage pie
B	okay
C	but I think a lot of us just called it shepherd's pie
A	yeah
B	yes I do like that
A	mm
C	mm
B	I don't make that ever
C	well I'll do it for another time
B	so we'll go on a walk after tea?
C	yes
A	mm
C	how far would you like to go?
B	ten miles?
C	well shall we just do the short one
B	yes
B	that sounds nice
B	we did do a swim
B	just to get some fresh air
C	and then we could check the viewings see if there's anything on
B	ah yeah
C	last night last night
B	mm it has
B	mm
B	yes
A	it's been
C	yes and we
B	mm
C	we had two days out on the road didn't we? cos going over to
B	mm
B	yes it's a long way
C	well I haven't looked
A	mm
C	I don't think there is and we watched Ben Fogle last night
B	wasn't as good
B	they were too happy
C	yes
B	you need people to be a bit miserable otherwise it's not really
C	yes
B	challenging viewing is it?
C	no
B	they were just having a nice time
C	yes it wasn't different enough was it?
B	no and er they didn't really answer the question what they did for money so it was all a bit suspicious
B	they didn't answer that at all did they?
C	no they didn't they
B	yes so it's not clear if er
A	perhaps
B	mm could be drug smuggling
A	mm
B	it's funny that pirates are so big now again
A	they're still around aren't they?
B	more aren't they?
A	yes
B	around Sudan
A	the last twenty years it's all come back
B	mm
C	oh yes
B	oh yes that's true there's lots of jobs aren't there? for ex-army
C	yeah
A	mm
B	mm
B	because they pay for private protection now
A	security mm
C	yes and it's very good wages
B	mm but very dangerous if you
A	yes
B	if there is an incident you've kind of had it haven't you?
A	yeah yeah
C	yeah yes
B	you know even with one or two of you what are you going to do?
A	yeah
C	no I think what his plan is is to try this and try and live at home
B	mm
C	or near home and they'll
B	yeah
A	did you say if there was
C	mm mm
C	mm
B	yes I would like some thank you
C	I might
B	mm that's really good
C	erm I might just have no vegetable
B	that's alright
C	yes it was and it was just so easy
B	mm
C	boiled it for about three quarters of an hour
B	oh right
C	and just left it cos I couldn't be bothered with it last night
B	but I think it's better to leave it actually cos the flavours develop probably more
B	and then today you just put in the vegetables with it?
B	oh with the chicken? oh that was sensible yeah saves time
C	yeah because then you're getting more of the flavours aren't you?
B	mm
C	and then just the stock cube today
B	oh right
C	and I put a bouquet garni in
B	mm
B	yes
C	no salt because
B	ah good
C	mm
B	yes that's right
C	I did a little bit of erm the grass round the edge of the middle flower bed
B	oh
C	I was quite
B	ah that was good
C	and then I planted the
B	yes I saw that
C	and then I got in my bed
B	really?
C	yeah
C	and and that was it
B	mm
A	just get some lumps out of it
B	like you had yes
B	yes
B	ah yes can you just hold onto them?
C	yes that's fine
B	not too much in the way
C	no cos
B	yes
C	okay I'll keep hanging onto books
B	yes that would be nice since I won't have any money
B	or any work when I come back
B	then that'll be good at least I can read
B	I'll wait I think if I want to change jobs I need to not take the first thing that comes along too quickly
A	no
B	but erm yes what I really need is just a few thousand savings but then I can get by for the winter can't I?
C	yes yes that's right
B	don't need much
C	no no you don't
B	thank you
B	yes that's good
C	yes well you can be looking can't you? while you're away
B	yeah that's right mm
B	yes I won't spend anything
C	no
B	and I'll try and do lots of
C	oh yes that's good so you've got er quite a bit to bring back with you then in the next few months?
B	hopefully
A	do you think there's any in
B	there er
B	there's only one company for the south west and they're based out of
A	they're based at
B	based out of
A	ah
B	but they do examine from time to time in
A	yes
B	I am looking
B	yes the problem is that it expires quite quickly
A	oh
B	and then you have to start the whole training all over again
A	ah
B	which they only do once a year
B	and then it's a whole weekend gone
B	more than one weekend actually and you're not paid for the training
C	oh right
B	so that's what
C	oh right okay
B	it's really hard to motivate yourself to do all the training again
C	oh yes
B	someone else suggested to me there's a different sort of exam here
C	oh right okay
B	look to see if anywhere is that is more
A	yeah
B	a bigger thing here
C	yes
B	I emailed
C	yes that's good
[ANNOTATION]	The training lasts for 40 hours.	Neutral
B	no
C	yeah well that's good
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B called someone.	Contradiction
B	but anyway they don't have one in Bahrain
C	oh er right okay
B	yeah not
A	I'm
A	well that one to go
B	okay
A	oh
C	ah
B	the British Army's got one
A	oh right
[ANNOTATION]	Bahrain is a tropical country.	Neutral
B	and it's done in levels
A	yeah
B	like level one beginner
A	yeah
B	who can't do anything
B	yes I just did level one
[ANNOTATION]	The beginner level is not very hard.	Neutral
C	oh
B	well part of level one
B	it was quite good
A	yeah
B	it gives you little medals
B	when you do it
A	mm
B	and it asks you to log how many you've done
[ANNOTATION]	The medals are made of gold.	Neutral
A	how many levels does it have?
B	actually I'm not sure
A	oh it can happen can't it?
C	yes it's not surprising
B	no and I've been there quite a while
C	mm
B	cos you just don't do any incidental exercise so it's all got to be an effort
C	mm
B	you know but and I don't like going to the gym
B	then I don't do it
C	no that's it
[ANNOTATION]	The gym is open 24/7.	Neutral
B	I only do it occasionally cos I don't enjoy it
C	no
B	I swim but then it's probably just maintaining existing
A	mm
C	yes
B	whatever state you're at it will just maintain that won't it?
C	mm
B	maybe you'll
C	mm
B	over time but you're not really going to
C	mm
B	suddenly lose weight
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B loves working out at the gym.	Contradiction
C	so you'll have something to focus on when you come back
B	yes that'll be nice actually
C	mm
B	having the time
C	yeah and the
B	yes
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B doesn't know how to swim.	Contradiction
B	there was something in the paper in that awful
B	you know we were saying they were consulting on it a couple of weeks ago?
A	mm
B	well apparently that's all been agreed now
C	oh right
[ANNOTATION]	The couple has taken a divorce now.	Neutral
B	and it's going through the two main cemeteries on
C	is it?
B	I don't
C	mm so that was better
B	it will be better than the er what you have to do now you know
C	yeah
B	you know sort of bits
B	on a pavement alongside a very busy main road
[ANNOTATION]	There was a lot of traffic in that road.	Entailment
A	they're like
B	yes yeah so it's sensible what they've suggested
A	mm
B	yes that's right
A	mm
C	there hasn't
B	yes
C	it I mean it's taken off into the cities
[ANNOTATION]	The suggestion was irrational.	Contradiction
C	you know
B	yes that's right
A	mm
C	mm
B	not try and retro fit it years later
A	not yeah cos they subtract them from the
C	no
B	mm
A	car
B	yeah
A	which then you can't get
B	no they've got to do it at the time
C	yes
A	mm
B	it was excellent there wasn't it?
C	and Copenhagen
B	mm
C	mm
A	erm could you pass the bread please?
C	mm
B	mm nice
C	mm it is nice
B	yes
A	yes it's
C	you see that's good you've done half half cos that actually
A	yeah
A	well if a hundred percent means you don't eat it
B	yes that's true
A	then fifty percent would be better than a hundred percent
B	that's true
A	cos you're having
C	mm
A	half of it
B	yes
A	instead of none of it
C	that was very nice
B	it was nice
B	oh dear that's bad
C	yes
B	and do you erm don't have to chop all the seeds up?
A	no er
B	no? they just come like that?
A	I've got I've got get a packet
B	ah they're already chopped?
A	yeah they're like pumpkin seeds
B	ah that's good ah yes that's good
A	sesame seeds and sunflower seeds
B	cos that'd be annoying
B	yes
C	well you might decide to make bread
B	yes I might and you can always use gluten free flour
C	ah yes
B	if you are worried about it
B	it doesn't rise as well but you can just add more yeast
A	mm
C	mm
B	yes and I think a lot of it is just the way that modern bread is made
C	mm
B	that's too fast
C	mm
B	that it's changed cos you don't leave it leave it to
C	yes
B	prove or rise or whatever it's called
C	mm
A	yeah
B	but that does make sense doesn't it? because it was a
A	mm mm well alive
B	yes and it takes time
A	mm
B	so if you then take that stage out
A	yeah
C	mm
B	then something different's happened to the food
C	your dad sometimes puts half of it in the freezer if we're not
C	that's
C	but
B	mm
C	but you get used to having it a bit thicker erm so when you have er sliced bread it seems very very thin
B	mm
C	sliced bread
B	mm yes please
A	herbal tea?
B	yes please
C	mm ah yes there's some mint in on the window sill there's
B	mm
B	yes please
A	six? is that what
C	no I'll have an ordinary tea please
B	I'll have er three leaves
C	oh you only have three do you? is that enough?
B	for me it is
C	ah yes I don't know how many they're meant to put in
B	as many as you want
C	yeah but to be
C	I'll google it tonight
B	they normally say a sprig
C	oh
B	but I don't know how big their sprig is
C	a really really good crop because you know they're sort of multiplying all the time so er I've had
B	really?
C	yeah
B	wow
C	so I hope they get to a good size but I think they will
B	mm
C	so it's quite exciting
B	mm
B	then you'll panic cos
C	erm no I don't I don't think so I think it'll be fine I'll I'll
B	mm
C	just you know I don't want to waste
B	no
C	er
B	yes it is a bit
B	mm no they don't
C	mm
B	give some to grandpa
C	well yes I could put some away that'd be nice as well wouldn't it?
B	mm
C	he'd be pleased
B	yes he would
C	cos he knows this is my first go at growing anything
B	mm
C	yes he did
B	oh
C	he used to grow tomatoes
B	oh really? oh
C	yeah
B	you should tell him that
B	remind him
C	yes and erm
B	oh right
B	mm
B	mm
C	used to get paid threepence an hour
B	oh right that was nice
B	mm
C	but I don't know what else he grew
B	but did he do all the garden stuff?
C	yes
B	oh that was
B	mm
C	so it was less but it was a tremendous amount of work
C	mm
B	mm
C	and then er he did the gardens with
B	yeah
C	and again I think it would've been a lot of work
C	yeah less than here
B	yeah it's less flowerbeds mm
C	yes but still
B	and it's quite well established but still
C	yes
B	mm
C	yes less flowerbeds so there aren't actually that many if you if you've got er
B	no
C	a ride-on mower and just ignore the hedges then it wouldn't be so much to do would it?
B	no
C	mm
B	yes it's
B	yes
C	the house is bad on the outside isn't it?
B	yes it's kind of rotting
B	wooden bits
C	well I suppose it's just it's not worth spending money on it
B	no
C	so hopefully it will last
B	yes
B	ah
C	but there's another one hanging off
A	mm
B	I'm surprised
C	well yes
B	oh she's gone today?
C	yes
B	ah so she would've missed
C	er
B	mm
C	but she's going to see
B	ah yes
C	so she's gone today seeing her friend I imagine staying the night and
B	ah yes
C	so that's
C	oh yes
B	but she must be flying at a different time
C	maybe ah yes just
B	yes
C	but anyway you never know you might see her at the airport I
B	mm yeah that's true
C	I could send her an email
B	mm
B	I did thank you yes it's nice
B	it's nice it's very sweet
C	oh yeah
B	I couldn't have that much of it
B	I'll clear up
B	ah yes that's good
B	it's very sweet yes

B	no I haven't done
C	haven't
B	I made tea bread once
C	oh right yes that's
B	oh next time

B	yes
B	yes that sounds good
C	and I'll take
B	mm
C	cos when I do it I make three
B	sorry?
B	oh
B	they probably didn't know did they?
C	madness
B	that's
C	mm
B	it's not exactly a desert
B	oh November oh
