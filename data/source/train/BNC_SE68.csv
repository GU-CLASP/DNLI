B	that's what I'm saying it will be probably the end of May beginning of June or end of June beginning of July
F	well we're from the beginning of June to the end of September
D	why? how did she make you feel guilty?
B	are you there for three months?
A	just don't say anything to
F	no
A	grandma about it until you

A	unless you know for sure
B	I know we're definitely going
E	cos I
B	it's just dates
E	I don't get exactly I don't know definitely days and stuff
B	that's what I just said
E	literally this this weekend
A	and seeing as
E	and I said to her at the beginning I think it was Friday afternoon when
A	yeah
E	and what dates I can go and also if I've got hospital appointments and stuff so
A	hospital? what have you got a hospital for?
E	oh
A	no tell me
E	I've just
D	oh
E	I've got to go to the doctor's might have to have
A	oh okay
E	to have a little operation that's all
A	for you?
F	operation don't say operation say
A	and then you do that
B	I I found
F	that sounds quite a lot
D	really?
F	you'd be able to do better than that yeah
A	what for the June?
B	what at that time of year?
F	well can't you find a
A	for June?
B	yeah yeah but the tax free ones aren't that often any more
F	aren't they?
B	no not like they used to be
D	ah
B	you used to be able to get them quite easily
F	I've been there last year in July
D	what
F	forty-nine pounds return or
B	oh oh I'll keep looking
F	mind you er things have changed
C	was that to Toulouse?
B	but they're the the tax free ones
F	er I can't remember
B	you've got to check every day
F	maybe
B	haven't you really?
C	where did I pick you up from was it Toulouse?
F	oh
C	Toulouse
F	Toulouse yeah oh yeah that's Toulouse that's Toulouse
B	oh yeah
F	but she hasn't got a car now you know that?
B	no we'll have to hire one
A	I know it's a
F	but if you do go I know this is going way too fast for some but if you do go and you're gonna hire a car don't restrict yourself to Bergerac
B	okay
F	cos you could both Bordeaux and Toulouse are both really close
A	how much is it?
F	so
A	I mean I've not ever
B	oh I suppose cos everyone can drive straight through
F	so if you're driving anyway it's it's about an extra
B	yeah that's true
unknown_female	it's it's been so so long I
F	yeah
unknown_female	I couldn't really say to be honest with you
B	that's true actually
A	no
unknown_female	there are so many changes
A	do you have any idea?
F	oh dog sorry
A	do you have any idea how much it is to hire? cos I have never ever hired out there
F	well we haven't hired for years but we used to it depends again you just shop around and you can get something for about thirty quid a day
unknown_female	it it pays you to move away from the airport and go to a a railway station or something so
A	yeah
unknown_female	they're cheaper
F	yeah that's true cheaper than like going
unknown_female	but you know it then you but then you've got the inconvenience of getting to a railway station haven't you? so
A	no you haven't because you could say
unknown_female	I dunno whether it's
A	to mum pick us up from Bergerac Airport and run us to Bergerac Station
F	but she can't
A	she can
F	she hasn't got a car
A	she can run one of you
unknown_female	she's got her
A	she's got her shoebox she could run one of you to the station pick up the car come back and pick the other person up from the airport
F	well what if you're going to if you're flying and hiring
A	no
F	which is more expensive to flight path
A	no no I'm just saying but but
unknown_female	but but you can find er all this out on the internet
A	mm
unknown_female	to begin with can't you? what what the difference in prices are between
A	no the likelihood is if we do go down there for a holiday we'll drive down
unknown_female	yeah you can just get taxis or
A	anyway but
unknown_female	yeah
A	I was just thinking like occasionally and it is occasionally a proper
B	it's cheaper surely it's cheaper to
A	well it depends how long we're
A	it depends on when we're going what time of the year we're going long we're going for if we're just going for four days yes obviously
C	are we petrol or diesel you're petrol aren't you?
A	we're petrol
unknown_female	yeah
F	we filled up
C	diesel's so cheap out in France
F	we filled up in France last time for less than a euro a a litre
A	I know that's brilliant
unknown_female	yeah
F	and and ninety-nine and a half
unknown_female	might be worth driving down in my car then
F	well I tell you what it's worth thinking about a
C	are are you diesel?
A	yeah but er unless you're gonna go the
E	mine's just like really super-efficient
B	and unless we're going
A	unless you're going on the
unknown_female	yeah
A	A roads
unknown_female	yeah
A	you spend a fortune on er motorway tolls
C	we get we get ours is
A	it costs about eight er eighty quid each way on motorway tolls
unknown_female	yeah that's why we've cut out we we
F	we go the long way the normal routes
unknown_female	we do the short sections on the motorway
A	yeah
unknown_female	but the big long ones that's thirty odd euros
A	yeah
unknown_female	we we do the the back roads
A	yeah
F	mm
unknown_female	just er but that's sixty odd euros
A	yeah it's a
unknown_female	there and back
A	massive amount a massive amount we've spent on we used to
F	but on the other side sixty odd euros now is about forty-five quid
unknown_female	yeah er the
F	with the
unknown_female	the exchange rate
F	the exchange rate
unknown_female	it's really good at the moment really good
F	mm
A	I think
C	oh to go across on
F	I saw a twenty pounds return the other day
C	did you?
A	for wine?
C	mm
F	for day trip oh wine
A	yeah
F	and fuel
C	fuel mm
A	yeah
F	but we pay what are paying at the moment for diesel?
A	but do you think you can still get away these days
F	one pound
C	I don't know
F	thirteen
unknown_female	about one pound thirteen
A	bringing it back on the
unknown_female	yeah
F	and in France now
A	like we used to
F	if assuming that ninety-nine percent
C	I dunno
F	is still going
B	what?
F	that was about seventy-five pence
C	sixty or eighty litres in the boot didn't we?
F	and later
C	well sixty at least
F	forty euros
A	well we had a diesel car at the time and we used to go over to France
F	oh
A	fill up the tank and we had three twenty litre jerry cans and we used to fill up with diesel as well and bring back in the boot
C	that's it
A	I'm not but that was sort of pre-twin towers and all the Isis and all that
F	but that wouldn't
A	I dunno
F	mm
A	checks that they do at borders now I don't think we'd get a
F	but they don't they still don't do checks on site
unknown_female	when when when you were
A	I don't know if we'd get way but once
unknown_female	it's
A	but once but no but once they did
E	I think it would be bad luck wouldn't it?
A	they did check us and they they found the
F	yeah
A	they saw that we had three jerry cans
A	and they never questioned it but I'm not sure if they'd do the same now
unknown_female	mm
B	is it when's the dinner ready dad?
C	I dunno the Yorkshire puddings are in so that's what I'm waiting for
B	how long?
unknown_female	yeah cos we paid seventy quid just when we were about here
A	mm
F	yeah that's about the same
unknown_female	sixty litres well it wasn't the the full sixty obviously it
F	is that
unknown_female	yeah
F	so if we're saving forty pence a litre
unknown_female	yeah cos you never run it
A	well we used to frequently buy really cheap
F	right
A	tickets go over for the day you know buy stock up on booze wine
F	yeah
A	and fill up the car and bring a spare tank as well spare tank to get back
E	the only trouble with that with me is if I've filled my house with booze I'd just try and drink it
A	well this was
A	that is a problem
F	business
E	yeah
F	put it it
E	that's
F	put it in put it in the smash
B	what?
E	but we'll need to smash through the lawyer
D	how do you know there's two hundred pounds in it did you put it all in at once?
B	no I've been counting as I go cos
D	oh right
B	it's around about that
C	is anyone anyone good at making gravy?
C	are you any good at making
unknown_female	you're kidding
C	cos all I do is put Bisto and some hot water so I've
E	I'll make gravy
C	yeah?
F	oh so you can do it?
E	I'll do it yeah
D	yeah
F	oh
D	I can't bear the thought of eating Bisto
C	I've got that to use for something
F	now I feel really bad cos
D	why do you feel bad?
F	for not for not not responding when
D	do you know how to make gravy?
F	I didn't say no I just well
B	didn't respond
F	yeah
F	I make good gravy
D	your brother in law wanted your help and you just
unknown_female	but it depends what you've got if you've got the juices from the tin
F	well then presumably you can
D	because I always just make gravy from Bisto I've never made a proper gravy
F	one day I'll show you how to make proper gravy and you'll
D	can you?
F	never have to do it with Bisto again
A	I'm not quite sure how to make proper gravy to be honest
F	well you just
A	I used cornflour if I do make it
F	soft
A	well I make it with Oxo
F	in butter
A	my idea of proper
F	but it depends if you've got any stock handy real stock
A	well
F	if you've got the juices from the meat in that will do
A	yeah but I can never differentiate juices from fat
F	well put it into a tall glass
unknown_female	yeah before you
F	it'll just separate out
A	oh
unknown_female	but yeah you make in in the roasting tin getting all the
A	yeah
unknown_female	black burnt bits off the tin and whatever you're gonna flavour
A	so the fat all goes in as well
unknown_female	yeah but then the fat comes up to the top if you leave it for a couple of minutes and then
F	spoon it off
unknown_female	you just scoop it off with a spoon
F	gotta make it with a bit of fat
unknown_female	and then the liquid underneath
F	you want some fat
unknown_female	is your gravy
F	cos it's
A	you don't if you're Slimming World
F	oh or if you really want to do it properly just put it in the fridge half you know do it in advance put it in the fridge till the fat goes hard
A	mm
F	and then you just cut it off
A	mm that's true
unknown_female	yeah that's
A	that bit used to er
unknown_female	that's a bit drastic cos then
F	you know we used to have those pots didn't we?
unknown_female	by that time the joint's got cold
D	yeah
A	it's obviously because they're all the all the
F	real dripping
A	all the stock at the bottom
F	yeah
A	and dad used and they used to
F	oh
A	peel the fat off the top and fry our eggs in it every morning
F	yes
D	oh my god
unknown_female	yes real real dripping
A	yeah
unknown_female	oh yeah well that's what you did that's what my mum did
A	and we that's what we did the Sunday roast
unknown_female	I mean you didn't you didn't have
A	it all went into the fridge and
unknown_female	you didn't have cooking oils as the way you have now
D	no no
unknown_female	you just used fat from the
unknown_female	from the weekend joint
A	oh I do sound old we used to
D	I don't know how you survived
unknown_female	the weekend
D	so much
unknown_female	the weekend joint gave you your fat for the week
A	well doesn't it go to show then all this
F	well you can use a little bit of fat
A	health freak and
D	a little bit
A	health and fitness
F	especially also we lived in houses that weren't er yeah well no
D	oh so your body used the more yeah
F	so your body was using more energy just to keep warm you know it was it was cooler
A	that's true
F	we're talking about making it sound as if it's Victorian
A	er?
F	it sounds as if it's Victorian the era
A	I know that's what I was I saying I feel like
D	ah
F	do you remember people not being on the phone? no I'm not on the phone
A	I can remember people used I can remember as a child we used to say are you on the phone?
F	yeah
A	when you wanted to know whether they had their
F	asking that are you on the phone
A	are you on the phone and then and then
F	yeah do you have a phone in your house?
A	it kind of became accepted that everyone's on the phone so it was what's your phone number?
F	yeah
A	and then it was have you got a mobile?
unknown_female	yeah
A	and now it's what's your mobile?
F	I can remember people not being on the phone
unknown_female	hey no biting no biting
D	you don't do that now
F	no but you never see people using telephone boxes do you?
D	no I thought you meant that you don't have a phone now
unknown_female	no
A	when I first moved into my
unknown_female	good girl
A	our first house
D	yeah you did yeah
A	in
D	I thought you were talking about now
A	when I moved out
F	no
A	out of the nurse's home and
D	yeah
A	we lived and into our first shared house
D	okay
A	in
unknown_female	oh
A	to the end of the road
unknown_female	oh oh
A	once or twice a week to phone mum and dad to talk to them
D	you just Skyped on your laptop
A	that's how our that's how I
F	it is really really different isn't it?
A	yeah
unknown_female	my my dad's comes from
A	yeah
unknown_female	and then and then run up the road you know to to make sure nobody was in the phone box
A	yeah
unknown_female	in his allotted time so to phone Birmingham
A	that's weird no that no I don't remember
A	that bad
F	I don't remember that
A	but I can remember when my auntie auntie
F	yeah
A	in the seventies?
F	yeah it was er seventy-five
A	and mum used to phone probably about twice a year because it was so expensive
F	yeah
unknown_female	yeah
A	and she used to have to book she used to have to phone up the operator and book her allotted time and it was it would only be for about five minutes cos it cost such a lot of money
F	and it was a kind of Christmas
A	and it was
F	and you couldn't always get the call on Christmas day
unknown_female	no
A	no but she would then she would have a five minute allotted time and she would have to book that call to Canada via the operator
D	I don't wish I was born in
D	nineteen seventy-five god
F	that was the if that well if you think that was the worst thing about it
unknown_female	but we were happier then
F	amount of
D	I'm happy
F	agro and stuff
unknown_female	we were happy then weren't we?
D	I'm a happy person
A	no I don't know if we were happier then because everything
unknown_female	don't you?
A	that's like I was saying earlier every generation looks back on their childhood and says oh yes it was
unknown_female	oh yeah of course
A	we were happy
unknown_female	it's an element of youth
A	yeah
unknown_female	youthful yeah you're right you
D	nostalgia
A	nostalgia
F	but there are research teams who do erm
unknown_female	but
F	surveys
unknown_female	as kids
F	of how happy we are
unknown_female	I think we had a better time than things now cos of people parents allowed to
F	there was no there was less pressure in everyday life
unknown_female	afraid to let them out
F	less worry
unknown_female	you used to went out on your bikes and just disappeared for the day
A	well as
D	low technology
F	yeah
A	yeah
F	it was a low tech
unknown_female	yeah
A	but then you see we say
F	well we didn't think it was low tech it was high-tech for its day because we compared it with twenty thirty years earlier
unknown_female	yeah
D	mm
A	we say oh yeah we had a better time cos we used to go out and play on our bikes but kids today might say well actually we don't wanna be we'd rather stay in and play on our Playstations so therefore we're having a better time
F	yeah
A	it's all you know
F	well in thirty years' time you'll be talking to your kids and you'll be saying well we didn't have implants we had to walk across the room and pick the phone up
D	yeah
F	then you had to press the button
F	you couldn't just you couldn't just think of the number you wanted
A	yeah
F	and it's
unknown_female	no biting
F	that's that's the scary bit I think
unknown_female	stop biting
D	yeah
A	yeah
F	scares the life out of me
A	yeah
A	yeah
D	yeah
unknown_female	stop biting
D	you're gonna feel all self-conscious now when
F	I'm really worried about that I wonder who else I've done it with
D	you've done it probably done it with everyone
F	well if there was
A	well if you were in the office and someone's feeling a little bit
F	yeah
A	hello hello ah
F	well it's been lovely to meet you
F	ah I'm scared now I'm being really weird they all think I'm weird
F	oh
unknown_female	hey-ho
A	hey
E	yeah?
unknown_female	oh put her ears back
F	she likes it like that
unknown_female	what makes you think that?
F	she doesn't mind
D	who doesn't mind what?
F	her ears
D	what doesn't?
F	she doesn't even know
D	why have they been chopped off?
D	it was mainly her air wasn't it mum?
A	well I suppose it was mainly her hair but she did it was it was also mannerisms and things
D	yeah a little bit
unknown_female	phew I'm hot now
D	I know it's boiling in here isn't it?
unknown_female	yeah
D	oh my god it's twenty-four degrees in here
unknown_female	bloody hell
F	it's because the fire's alight
D	turn it down
F	is there is the erm floor eating on?
D	yes
unknown_female	it doesn't feel warm and yet it doesn't feel cold
F	I'm very
unknown_female	cos I suppose that's yeah
D	that's the point
unknown_female	yes
F	mind you we are sitting still mm
D	phew twenty-four degrees
F	what other technological changes are there gonna be in your
D	oh erm
F	what year were you born? ninety-one?
D	ninety-one
unknown_female	driverless cars
D	driverless cars if yes
unknown_female	and electric cars too
D	I think they're already here though
unknown_female	oh they are they've started
D	they just
unknown_female	yeah they have really started big time
F	yeah
unknown_female	in the next five years you there's gonna be a real
D	I really want an electric car if when I get enough money that'll be my next car
F	an electric one?
D	but yeah well a hybrid one at the moment because I don't think at the moment there's enough chargers everywhere
unknown_female	no there isn't
D	so only the hybrid but
F	mm
[ANNOTATION]	electric cars are limited at the moment	Entailment
D	so
F	I've got a theory about the way I think the electric cars in the future they won't be rechargeable they'll have rechargeable batteries which you will then you'll just change the battery and you'll go into a
unknown_female	but that's already started Renault do they must do it
F	you will go into a fuel station and they will have
F	yeah
unknown_female	to to have
F	but these forecourts the tanks would be gone they will massive they'll just be big storage areas with car places on the
[ANNOTATION]	interchangeable batteries have already been invented	Entailment
unknown_female	yeah but now we've got two choices
unknown_female	with with electric batteries just to to swap them over you'd need one for every model of car
F	well there'd have to be some standardisation
D	yeah unless they're standardised
unknown_female	mm we need to have one
F	maybe maybe a series of sizes they've got different sizes of cars
unknown_female	no they won't they'll they'll develop superchargers
F	batteries are standards they're already
unknown_female	they'll
F	really?
unknown_female	and erm
[ANNOTATION]	car are all the same sizes	Contradiction
F	isn't that
unknown_female	half fill it in in fifteen minutes
F	but what about in my gas bottles when you go you know you just go down and you give the old gas bottle back and you
unknown_female	yeah you're talking about one gas bottle
B	whose wine is this?
D	it's for everyone
[ANNOTATION]	the wine is for one person	Contradiction
B	oh
D	is it is it erm up to a standard
B	I don't know
D	of red wine?
B	yes
D	no thank you
[ANNOTATION]	the wine is to be shared	Entailment
unknown_female	how many different models of electric car are are there already let alone what's going to be produced in the future?
F	well obviously standardisation will come
unknown_female	the car will become
F	obviously standardisation will come
unknown_female	and and they're not they're not like car batteries I mean like the Tesla uses er it's
F	mm
unknown_female	it's in the chassis of the bolt on
F	well I wondered if there'll be where the boot is or where the bonnet is or something
B	do you want some red wine?
F	erm er no I'll have one a bit later thank you
unknown_female	mm and I'm fine thanks
F	but don't don't hold er erm if if it's all gone that's fine
unknown_female	I've been drinking anyway low alcohol
B	no there's still loads left
F	oh okay
D	which one's for you and which one's for
B	that's for
D	oh okay
B	I'm driving
D	oh right
unknown_female	but yes erm
F	well maybe yeah
unknown_female	electric vehicles are so
F	passed the Aston Martin
unknown_female	the pickup is you know the pull is so
F	and was it silent?
unknown_female	yeah but the thing is they they're now saying that they have to
F	yeah
unknown_female	cos they're dangerous
F	yes so
D	yeah
F	you step in the road and a bike's charging down the
unknown_female	yeah
F	cos you can't hear anything can you?
unknown_female	no
F	mm
unknown_female	well I like chips
F	mm
D	microchips
F	microchips yeah
unknown_female	yeah like like Tilly's
unknown_female	like Tilly's microchip
F	yeah we'll all have but I don't need for identification I mean that that will read our thoughts and will do things
unknown_female	that has already started
F	on command
unknown_female	there was a thing on the on the television there's an American company? erm you I mean it's not obligatory but you can have it done and they put erm a little microchip
F	chip
unknown_female	microchip like hers in in there
F	a
unknown_female	and when you go into your building or when you want to use something within your building and go through various doors instead of having a card
D	well it's the same that's isn't that just same as thumbprints?
unknown_female	in electric
D	and they may as well put a thumbprint reader isn't that
F	thumbprint readers don't work
D	how is that
F	I've got a thumbprint
unknown_female	they don't work
F	reader on my laptop and it's ridiculous
D	do they not?
unknown_female	they they're not that no
D	no?
F	I have to do it about twenty times
unknown_female	yeah
F	for it to work
unknown_female	well I don't know what happens if you
D	yeah I
unknown_female	I don't know
F	like
unknown_female	but
F	have to chop your hand off
F	but maybe they can cancel it or
unknown_female	so so that's already started
F	the maybe they could maybe you have a chip that could be programmable with a scanner
D	they do it in Japan
unknown_female	mm mm
D	apparently
unknown_female	oh
D	they've I don't know it's in the very early stages they've figured out a way to read your dreams so that you can play your dream back as a film almost
F	mind reading is I find
unknown_female	oh
F	that quite scary
D	mm
unknown_female	I don't know if I'd want that
D	no
F	cos I tell you what it's all about it's all about lost
D	yeah
F	if the authorities or whoever's got control of the system
unknown_female	well
F	means you can't go down there and you can't go down there
F	and we'll all just gonna
unknown_female	cars that park themselves they've developed that already
F	yes I know
unknown_female	they're on sale now
F	yeah yeah
unknown_female	curmudgeon
F	thing but you know it's all we are I I I just fear that we're gonna lose our autonomy as human beings and we're just gonna become like ants
unknown_female	yeah
F	this technology because understandably if you can't have everybody running around doing what they want
unknown_female	mm
F	but
unknown_female	but that's already you can get that already now
F	mm
unknown_female	automatic breaking
F	yeah
unknown_female	it slows down
F	it is great obviously you'd sit there you could read a book or you know doze off
unknown_female	mm
D	in erm
F	the computer's failed you've got to drive it yourself now
D	in Germany his erm
F	oh yeah it beeps at you
D	yeah but he was coming out of one car park onto
F	but all cars do that don't they?
D	not my Kia
F	oh right okay
D	coming out of the car park
D	going to
unknown_female	and then
D	well the more modern ones do
unknown_female	after about ten or fifteen seconds if you still don't put it on it
D	oh
unknown_female	it the the beep gets so loud you think fucking hell
D	I know
unknown_female	mm
D	and it was just beeping at me so loud I had to put my
unknown_female	mm
D	I said oh it's like the Stasi and went yeah exactly like the Stasi when we say this is like the Stasi
F	does he
unknown_female	Auschwitz Stasi
D	well there's two things I don't like is the Stasi and Nazis are two things that I don't
F	Stasis and the Nazis sound a bit the same don't they?
unknown_female	probably an anagram of each other
F	mm
unknown_female	but at the end of the day they did come second
F	what?
unknown_female	in the war
F	in the World Cup?
