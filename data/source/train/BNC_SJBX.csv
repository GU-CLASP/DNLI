B	you never have any Christmases again or you never have any birthdays again
H	I think let's keep everybody's birthday yeah okay
C	Christmases?
H	yeah
H	anyway
G	er which would you choose? for everything to happen twice as quickly
D	hello
G	or for everything to happen at half the speed?
F	half the speed
A	mm
C	half the speed yeah
B	that depends
C	depends what it is if it's something horrible
D	well it does if you're having
B	a working day
A	yeah
G	yeah
A	depends what it is yeah
C	visit to the dentist
A	things that you enjoy though would go really quickly and you'd be like sad
C	you know Sunday afternoons at half the speed
D	definitely if it works
F	you wouldn't know you'd be out
A	yeah but let's say you were doing painting you'd just get twice as much done in the same amount of time
unknown_female	yeah
E	you'd be unconscious here wouldn't you?
unknown_female	yeah
A	yeah that's true yeah actually yeah
D	yeah I try they don't let me give you anything
H	like you could still
D	that was my name
A	oh I see
F	yeah
A	everything goes twice as fast
D	oh
A	in that case then then there's no point in twice as fast it'd just be proportionally the same wouldn't it?
H	yeah but you'd get twice as much done in your life
A	yeah yeah I guess
G	I'm joking
A	depends what it means doesn't it?
A	yeah
C	which would you choose? to lose your sense of smell or lose your sense of taste?
C	what do you reckon? you get both don't you? together?
A	oh
F	that's it yeah smell affects taste
C	so that's probably a null and void one that one
H	taste
D	sorry I thought he was I've left enough for him there
I	you're alright
C	I'd probably if you had if it if it was separate I suppose I'd lose my sense of smell and having a sense of taste
A	no I wouldn't
C	probably
G	yeah
D	it was the last time I went out but that
A	I'd lose my sense of taste I think
C	no I would no I'd want my taste
D	do you want another wine or coffee or anything?
E	er
I	I don't think so
D	can you manage?
A	er no I feel like smells are quite nostalgic
A	and like quite homely and quite like
H	yeah
A	they give you emotions and moods whereas taste is just an indulgence
C	no taste taste taste is a big thing when you when you're eating something isn't it?
G	mm
C	if it tasted of nothing you wouldn't wanna eat it would you?
H	yeah but that's just but that's just food though
A	yeah
H	whereas I think smells are are quite sort of sentimental and quite emotional
A	smell covers lots of things
C	no I'd still rather taste though
C	I'm sorry can't agree with you
C	you're talking rubbish
D	you told me I couldn't give him any
E	no turkey's alright
D	I said can I give him any
C	doesn't miss a thing look at him looking watching
