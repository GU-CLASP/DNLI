B	invented by the Cypriani of
A	that means like Cypriot Cypriani?
B	I don't know
A	it says all these things you know like Byzantine but it doesn't explain what it is
B	mm Byzantine's an era isn't it?
A	yeah I understand they're like eras of like architectural design and things but it doesn't kind of give you any more detail than that I don't feel as though I've burnt

A	alright close enough
A	they must be quite dark these apartments mustn't they?
B	yeah
A	mm
B	and you've done this you'd start exploring other areas of it wouldn't you?
A	elsewhere yeah I don't think I'd spend a week just doing Venice
B	no it's a bit like being in London isn't it?
A	yeah
B	you do the touristy bit but then you start really exploring it like erm erm
B	yeah
A	they're lucky that they've got that apartment that they can go and stay in whenever

B	C five on the map
A	that is it's near the Academia it's this square here what
B	yeah Fondamenta Nani
A	it'll be on that bigger map that we've got
B	in Dorsaduro we should try that before we go back
A	well if we walk we're walking to there anyway
B	yeah
A	so if we're not too tired we could go on to it cos it's not well I'm saying it's not that much further on
B	what is this area?
A	Dorsaduro well that's not where we are now we're in San Marco still we're somewhere around here
B	yeah I mean it looks big but I'm sure we can do it
A	mm
B	I wonder how
A	shall I see if there's any wi-fi to ring him?
B	you can call him soon
A	mm I'll use the toilet before we finish our medicine
B	it's making me a bit heady actually
A	mm
B	I suppose it's
A	we
B	well a sandwich
A	yeah
B	it's so much quieter now isn't it?
A	mm
B	I prefer it like this
A	yeah me too
B	they don't mind you too much
A	no that woman did in that clothes shop in Mestre was a bit annoying remember?
B	mm
A	she was nice she was just a bit full on
B	there are lots of Americans here though
A	yeah loads I suppose it's probably like
B	Venice or Rome yeah
A	although that woman we met yesterday travelled around hadn't she?
B	she'd been around hadn't she? she'd done
A	mm did you think that was her granddaughter that she was with?
B	I'm not sure probably
A	probably
B	although she didn't live in the same place she said she was from South Carolina didn't she?
A	mm and she said she was well she said she lived in Florida she might not have been from Florida
B	there's probably a a lot of old people retire
A	on Florida
B	yeah whats it was saying
A	oh they've rented a house on in Florida
B	yeah but his his grandma lives in Albany and he said you know for like five months of the year it was snow and it's cold and she can't even walk to the end of the drive to pick up the mail why would an old person live in those conditions?
A	yeah when they could be
B	when they could in Florida
A	well it's good for arthritis and things like that as well isn't it?
B	well he said there were everyone says it's full of old people Florida but he said I'd rather be with old people who are fit and healthy cos they're out and about doing things
A	yeah
B	I don't know
A	so is that their plan?
B	he they plan to live in Florida
A	cos he cos
B	no
A	did
B	don't know he didn't say he doesn't get involved in that really
A	no probably does right
B	light headed
A	yeah squiffy
B	mm drink the water
A	I've drunk the water
B	or get some more water
A	let's drink it and ask for some more
B	mm
A	mm
B	cheers
A	not cheers over this
B	leave it darling
A	no no it's drinkable it's just not I wouldn't order it again
B	not enjoyable I wouldn't order it again
A	for that you may as well just have a glass of Prosecco or a glass of wine
B	I'd much rather have a glass of Prosecco
A	this erm soda's not even fizzy is it?
B	well they've put lemon in with it which makes me think it's the bitter erm liquor that they've put in
A	but it's still quite sweet I think
B	do you think?
A	I think it's
B	I don't think it's sweet at all
A	I think it's sweet
B	it just shows you where your taste buds are on your tongue cos at the front it's a little bit sweet
A	yeah I remember them doing that at the museum in where what museum was it? where they erm put a cotton bud in coffee and made you rub it on your tongue to see where you tasted different
B	like salt and sugar and
A	and salt and sugar and you taste it in different parts of your tongue and your mouth
B	mm clever isn't it?
A	yeah I don't understand why that would be like evolutionarily don't know
B	yeah why would you develop?
A	why would you develop different parts of your tongue to taste different things? cos it's like if you're taking tablets and you put it on your tongue at the front it tastes really bitter you know like tablets that aren't coated the powdery ones but if you put it to the back of your tongue you can't taste the powderyness it's bizarre
B	I thought that was a customer
A	did you?
B	yeah I did yeah I didn't recognise her
A	no she was behind the bar
B	she's the one who served us
A	mm
B	it's an American family I'm just earwigging
