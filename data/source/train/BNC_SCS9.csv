B	when we're old people like

A	but a bit more
B	I thought you meant like literally white clothes
A	yeah white clothes
B	I've never heard of White Stuff is
A	have you not?
B	is that like a
A	really? no no
B	or is it like a
A	it's like
B	worldwide?
A	it's well it's not worldwide but it's England based I think
B	I really think there's something wrong
A	yeah
B	with my hand
A	you should maybe go get it looked at like somewhere at the doctor's or somewhere
B	it's flipping
A	oh that's like er what the red thing?
B	mm
A	oh dear yeah maybe go maybe go go and
B	that looks like a bruise
A	it does a bit
B	oh no
A	it
B	doesn't it?
A	no well I mean that's just the way my arm's built but
B	I mean
A	but mine doesn't have like a line here
B	it is er
A	that look
B	see that?
B	that one looks like that
A	oh that's the one that isn't yeah
B	that's the one that's not
A	oh right
B	but oh that's the one
A	yeah
B	that is
A	yeah that looks like it's painful
B	yeah
A	oh fuck you
A	oh
B	it always does that
A	I hate
B	little window surprises
A	seven percent
B	seven percent?
A	I'm so dumb
B	hang on we're on
A	oh I'm so dumb
B	eight percent
A	oh it's not a full update cos it did do one the other day that took like an hour to load properly so maybe it's just the
B	it's annoying
A	mini one where is my phone? I can't deal without the internet for more than five minutes
B	good luck
A	I know
A	no I can do that if I go to bed early
B	yeah cos one o'clock will leave enough time won't it? it'll be like
A	yeah
B	where do you wanna do it? library? here?
A	yeah library I think just so we can get out cos I haven't really been out
B	cos we won't do it if it's here
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B wants to stay home.	Contradiction
A	well exactly yeah I'll just sit my room
B	mm yeah you wanna go somewhere that's?
A	mm
B	yeah that's a good idea
A	yeah I've seen them like do you mean the ones outside?
B	yeah
A	like the funny
B	mm
A	oh how much do they cost?
B	do they cost?
B	really? I thought they were free
A	oh are they?
B	I
A	oh okay
B	I thought
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B thought something was cost-free.	Entailment
A	I think something like
B	oh I thought you meant not the ones with the
B	the ones in the I think you might have to pay for those
A	yeah I was gonna say
B	there's ones they're
[ANNOTATION]	There are some thing that might be free.	Entailment
A	oh yeah the library oh I haven't seen
B	yeah
A	I haven't really been round the library that much I've only been around a couple like bits of it cos it's quite big I didn't really get
B	mm
A	have time to look around yeah we'll
B	yeah and then I can type up
A	or if it's too busy
A	we can go to the learning zone cos they've got space in there as well
B	oh yeah the learning zone
[ANNOTATION]	The library is a rather small place.	Contradiction
A	and that's open later as well which is really annoying like why is the library
B	I thought the library was
A	shut?
B	now twenty-four hour is it not?
A	I apparently it's not apparently it shuts at eleven
[ANNOTATION]	The library is open 24/7.	Contradiction
B	who said that?
A	erm I think it was who said that? someone said that to me yeah
B	I thought it was I've heard on Yik Yak people are on it at like two in the morning on
A	oh oh okay oh that's good then yeah cos someone said that it was just the learning zone that was open late but maybe it's changed now or something hopefully
B	why are you crying?
A	mm?
B	I thought you were crying
A	no
B	oh you've got Monet as your background
A	yeah
B	how how
A	I know
B	how arty
A	must be the Monet
B	must be the Monet
A	I need to change it
B	it's amazing
A	cos my hair's
B	you're so good at hair
A	really?
B	mm
A	hair is my weakness I feel like I'm really bad
B	really?
A	at drawing hair yeah
B	cos you can get that looks amazing like
A	mm
B	it looks really like thick and do you know what I mean?
A	yeah I don't know what it is I think maybe like from my perspective cos I've drawn it and I've like done I remember like the process of it that I can't really appreciate it as
B	you see all the flaws in it don't you?
A	yeah exactly
A	yeah so I can never see my own art the way other people might see it cos people have said to me oh you're so good at drawing and just like really?
B	but you really are
A	I I don't
B	you're really incredible
A	agree with that thank you
B	cos I guess that I'm gonna see it as a finished piece you're gonna see it as like
A	yeah
B	something that
A	exactly
B	still needs work aren't you?
A	like I remember like spending hours doing that hair
B	like do you ever feel
A	no never
B	not of any of them?
A	no
B	no
A	you just like the only reason I stopped doing the drawing is because I feel like fed up with it and I'm like right I can't do anything more than this I'm just gonna ruin it even further like
B	really?
A	yeah
B	that's really sad cos
A	I know it is quite isn't it?
B	you're so good
B	I always wondered if people that are really good at art or really good at real drawings like you see like cartoons as like really shit or do you just see it as different?
A	different yeah
B	just different
A	it's just a different style
B	really?
A	the only way
B	really?
A	I can sort of draw is by observation and
B	but I think
A	and
B	observation's harder cos you can't make up shit if it's not there
A	yeah
B	you know?
A	I know well it's difficult cos your brain tries to make make it up like especially
B	but you have to kind of and
A	when you're drawing people
B	ignore it
A	you have to ignore it like no that's not where the eye goes like I know it looks like it should go there but in the picture it's actually here and it's like really is frustrating
B	oh okay
A	it's so much easier to get the face right like cos it's not cheating because so many artists do it and it's just
B	yeah
A	a basic
B	yeah
A	like guide of where you want things to go like it you kind of make it your own when you just do the shading so it's it doesn't really count
B	that's cool
A	that's cheating in my opinion
B	if you think about it
A	it's just a way of doing creative art
B	in some ways yeah
A	so
B	I mean art is less creative than you think it is
A	oh yeah
B	it's very er
A	yeah definitely
B	like when you actually do art like everyone sees art as creative but when you actually sit and
A	yeah
B	being creative is not isn't isn't difficult but like it's really
A	yeah like I don't feel like any of my art's creative I just feel like I'm looking at something and drawing it the way I would the way my hand
B	but your hands
A	works I suppose
B	no it's not the way your hand works it's the way
B	the way your kind of your brain projects it and then
A	yeah
B	your hand follows
A	I dunno
B	it's not it's it is a skill
A	mm
B	it's definitely a skill
A	yeah
B	like anyone that can do
B	you know and you are included in that
A	you should have seen some of the people in my A Level class it was just ridiculous
B	amazing?
A	well my friend especially well my old friend like we kind of fell out a bit but she she draws like insanely realistic faces I'll show you
B	oh my god
A	oh I need to find my phone I don't have Instagram on my Ipod oh shit
B	I've just realised
A	what?
B	I can't write
A	oh no
B	I
A	what can you not write with it?
B	no
A	is it that painful?
B	it is it's like
A	can you like move the fingers?
B	the the tips
A	can you not can you not like there
B	not the wrist
A	really? can you not like do wrist movement?
B	no
B	I can do the
A	oh dear how did you fall on it again?
B	like splat
A	on like a table or a the floor?
B	floor
A	oh oh yeah go go to the doctor's tomorrow
B	what for a hand?
A	yeah for a hand
B	but like I've hurt this
A	well you can't write so that's kind of crucial isn't it?
B	shall I get ask for slingy sling? I hate slings
A	yeah
B	and I hate plaster casts
A	yeah well just type everything
A	so you can use your
B	yeah
A	hand
B	I'm still annoyed at that guy
A	yeah sleazy
B	I knew that it was that
A	yeah
B	in my heart but I was just like I'm just gonna hold on to believe I really hope thingy
B	he sounded genuine
A	yeah I mean because you actually need that one like
B	I'll ask him if you're able to do it
A	mm
B	are you able to do it?
A	yeah look at look at her art it's ridiculous
B	oh wow
A	like this is what she's doing at the moment she's doing like commissions for people like just look at how intricate it is like I just don't understand
B	that's really cool
A	I know
B	how has she only got thirteen likes?
A	oh I dunno cos I dunno
B	that's really cool
A	I know
B	oh look at the shading on the legs
A	the shading is just impeccable like it's crazy
B	oh wow
A	what?
B	what's that one? did she draw that?
B	oh I was gonna say
B	I was like did she draw that? no
A	probably a bit ambitious
B	wow
A	yeah
B	how big was that? oh it's oh it's
A	erm
B	oh I see it
A	yeah this is the
B	I thought that was her looking at it
A	this is isn't her painting no
B	wow
A	no this is just yeah that's the concept
B	that's really cool
A	it was about women's bodies in magazines which was good
B	did she get a good mark for it?
A	yeah she got an A star
B	oh my god
B	what overall?
A	yeah
B	at A Level?
A	uhu
B	wow
A	and she did this of thingy and thingy which I just
B	oh my god
A	think is amazing
B	Andrew Garfield
A	I know yeah
B	and Emma thingy
A	it's obviously them and it's so difficult to get a likeness like people don't understand
B	oh it is
A	who don't draw
B	definitely
A	like how difficult it is to get a facial likeness
B	I've got a friend that does that
A	yeah
B	I just like her style it's really cool basically
A	oh that's nice
B	and then it's not like
B	but look look it's like drawing
A	what?
B	she drew that
A	no she didn't
B	oh no she hang on
B	she's
A	I don't think she drew that
A	I was gonna say like
B	hang on where's the drawing? that these kind of things like
A	how did you mistake that for a cat?
B	I don't know I was er oh shit
B	what's it doing? no there we go
A	oh they're so pretty
B	it is it's
A	wow
B	it's really cute
A	is that watercolour?
B	I think so
A	cool
B	she does this oh there's a really good one in her history that I really liked I can't remember where it is but she does like maps and
A	wow
A	yeah you know I just wish I could paint
B	yeah oh my god
A	cos it's just so much more colourful and
B	it's such a good skill
A	yeah
B	but it's so hard
A	it is
B	to control
A	but I can't paint for shit I really can't
B	no neither can I
A	and people are like what? why can't you paint? like you're good at drawing like blah blah blah
B	it's completely different isn't it?
A	it is not the same thing not at all or not for me anyway I just make a mess I'm just like a messy clumsy kind of person and I can't control paint
B	me too
A	mess and
B	I'm not the best painter
B	to be honest people think
B	that's the thing when you say you enjoy art people think you're good at everything
A	I know all disciplines but it's not like there are so many different sides to it like there are some
A	I'm not going on it I'm just going on it to see
B	okay okay
A	just for the lols
B	yeah
A	and
B	yeah
A	and then some people
B	I'm not judging you
A	no know
A	oh just like some creepy guy called
B	that's is it's me it's me
A	oh so creepy
B	what's he said?
A	I don't know there's creepy people on the sexy dentist oh
B	yes
A	wah
B	get some gnashers in
A	no he's not sexy that's horrible
B	what's he look like?
B	okay
A	makes me wanna vomit
B	lol
A	yeah and then some people do like screen printing and textiles and all that shit
B	yeah me too just be like
A	and then I could just go to art school instead
B	would you like to go to art school?
A	yes if I could like get into that frame of mind where doing art is all I wanna do but yes
B	how about if you did fine art here?
A	mm I don't think you can like I I know they do art here but you have to like have been to foundations and stuff
A	but I did ask
B	complicated
A	it's like they expect that of you like and I don't have that
B	oh
A	and like I didn't do that well in art
B	well that's really annoying
A	overall in er A Level anyway cos I
B	what your art exam?
A	mm
B	did it go that badly?
A	yeah it really did
B	why?
A	cos I didn't do any work for it
B	cos from what I can see you did well
A	no like cos the problem was like at A Level they they wanted you to it was like quantity rather than quality because they can't
B	they want more like
A	measure
B	yeah
A	quality cos it's it's subjective like the subject like someone who might like my art might hate someone else's or vice versa so you can't like judge it on how good it is
B	mm but you can surely tell if something's
B	technically quite good you know?
A	well yeah I mean cos that that's the point like to get to A Level art you kind of have to have some technical ability to be able to just keep up with it but
B	mm
A	from all this stuff beforehand and I didn't have any like supporting work like any at all so I just went into the exam
B	oh my god
A	back it up
B	excellent
A	no wonder I did so badly in it like really no wonder
B	you didn't do that badly what did you get?
A	I got a C
B	yeah it's not
A	mm
B	bad
A	yeah I suppose it's a bit average isn't it?
B	you didn't fail
A	no
B	nowhere near failing
A	I didn't I yeah it's true I could have got an E like I think I got a D in that exam
B	mm
A	it
B	that's good
A	would have boosted it up a bit but I still got a C
B	I really I don't know why but I really
B	like these pictures
A	oh wow that's cool
B	they're just cool
A	is that like pen or something?
B	I think they're just
A	that's nice
B	pastels oil
A	mm
B	etcetera I dunno it's just nice and they're nice to
A	yeah
B	that's it's a nice
A	definitely
B	picture
A	I wish I could do them like
B	yes
A	that has all the mental health cartoons
B	oh I love
A	about
A	oh it's just just so great
B	it's amazing
A	yeah
B	she reminds me a bit of erm
A	yes
B	almost
A	Quentin Blake I love Quentin Blake
B	yes
A	yeah no I totally get that
B	slightly
A	yeah they're really whimsical
B	yeah yeah
A	or writing it down maybe dunno
B	it's just it makes me laugh of her stuff
A	it really does it's so funny
B	like what is that? it's just funny
A	I know what's the? oh I wrote etcetera wrong
A	has she?
B	like merchandise yeah
A	oh
A	well er well the pictures kind of make no sense but they really do make sense
B	yes they really do
A	and it's funny how she can do that
B	like she is very hashtag relatable
A	she is
B	it's just ah they're gorgeous aren't they?
A	yeah
B	like really nice pictures
A	like the funny thing is about these kind of pictures like people think oh they're so childlike like I could draw that when I was five but actually it's a lot harder to draw
B	yes
A	like this than it is a draw like that or something just like a technical drawing like to do it like this
B	it is yeah
A	and make it look like professional but also childish like it's really quite a skill
B	look at that
A	I love that one
B	it's so cute
A	that's one of my favourites
A	that's so cute
B	aren't these funny? that's a funny one
A	oh and people get them as tattoos
B	that must be really like wow
A	yeah
B	touching for her like
A	it must be
B	flattering
B	yeah you can get T shirts I think
A	I wanna buy something
B	somebody I know had a poster
A	oh look at the mugs
B	yeah I know
A	I would totally buy all this
B	me too oh the
B	phone case is amazing
A	I want to buy this
B	yeah
A	I've seen that one before
B	the llama
A	it's amazing no go away stop it
B	it's like
A	wow
B	twenty quid though
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	I know I always get surprised by how little like dollars and pounds like I mean how much like the difference is
B	I know
A	cute
B	oh
A	there are so many windows when it's updating it so
B	that's annoying
A	I know I was watching
B	really?
B	oh my god brilliant were you enjoying that?
A	yes I was actually I was like this is really bad but I'm kind of enjoying it
B	ironic
A	I but I'd forgotten how awful they are at acting like it's just horrendous
B	if I wake up and my arm is dead tomorrow because it feels like it did when it
A	maybe like sling it up so that you don't lie on it when you're asleep and make it worse that's what I had to do when
B	oh my gosh
A	so I was sleeping with it
B	really?
A	like up here it was so uncomfortable
B	how did you get used to doing that? I just sort of
A	I didn't it was only for a couple of days thank god but it was horrible
B	really?
A	you have to do that yeah it's
B	I don't know what I've done to this
A	oh no
B	it was really gross
A	oh my god yeah like
B	really?
A	my mum wanted to keep for nostalgic reasons
B	maybe one day it can be put in a museum of
A	oh yeah
B	this is what happened
A	my personal museum yeah of my life erm
B	oh my god
A	yeah but I remember
A	there was like a bit of pasta stuck down it
B	oh my god
A	when they took it off
B	dry pasta or
A	no like
B	out of interest what type of pasta?
A	erm tricolore
B	okay
A	mm it was the swirly one is that tricolore?
B	you mean fusilli?
A	or fusilli what's tricolore?
B	it's
A	is that actually a pasta? or is that just the it's
B	tricolore is the coloured ones
A	oh yeah no it was it was fusilli yeah
B	oh
A	it was disgusting yeah and this was when they were like sawing it off my arms so they saw the pasta
A	yeah
B	how old was the pasta?
A	I don't wanna I don't really wanna think about it
B	that's really
B	apple imagine or something like
A	oh like mouldy
B	that had just gone off yeah
A	that's gross yeah
B	like pasta I've never seen mouldy pasta so
A	no
B	it feels like it did when it was fractured my arm
A	shit
B	but I don't think it is I really hope it's not cos the pain is there and there
A	you can see it it's really red like it might just be like bruising
B	that's what I'm hoping
A	underneath or something
B	because I doubt that if it had broken again
A	I mean but you can move it though like if you really try it's not like impossible to move
B	that really
A	okay
B	just feels very sore
A	just go tomorrow
B	mm what just
A	go before I get up
B	turn turn up turn up at the doctors I've broken I think I've done something horrible to my
A	yeah cos that's like
B	I think I thought you had to book emergency appointments or do you just
A	you get like a it's called a something or other and you have to see a nurse first and then she refers you to a doctor and you get to see them like usually next day or a couple of days later
B	okay
A	so it's it is a lot quicker than just booking the appointment
B	yeah
A	but who knows it might be
B	it might be better tomorrow
A	and they might be able to just look at it quickly for you or something and you can just say to them like I've got like loads of essays to do and I really need to use my hand
B	yeah
A	so could you possibly kind of
B	it is kind of a priority
A	have a look?
B	at least you can type everything here
A	yeah
B	and I've not got exams in the next week
A	oh yeah I know
A	no it would not
B	yeah
A	so you could just
B	that's true
A	I could go to the library and then you could go to the doctor's and then you could just meet me in the library
B	yay
B	are you excited for tomorrow?
B	our little adventure to the library
B	you are
A	I'm not very
B	you're very excited
A	the essay and that's the non exciting part of it mm
B	and I'm not going to distract you I'm going to encourage you
A	oh
B	because I actually haven't got much work to do so I can help
A	mm
B	yay
A	oh no do something better if you don't have any work to do
B	no because I don't literally have any work cos I did my work today and tomorrow is my day off
A	yeah well go and have a nice day off then
B	but I
A	don't just sit in a library
B	honestly a day off
B	do you really think that is a good idea?
B	no I would rather have my mind doing something and if that's helping you
A	okay
B	then better
A	I'm probably just gonna be like making moaning noises
B	yeah I know I know I'm preparing myself for when this happens
A	oh I don't wanna do it
B	so what
A	I just want my sister to write it for me and she would I'm I'm just too scared to ask her
B	so it's
A	and then I feel like a fraud cos I would be a fraud if she wrote it
B	I'll write it for you
A	no
B	why?
A	cos that's mean
B	why is it mean?
A	well why would I make you do that? like she has to do that because she's
B	well we could do a joint effort
A	family so
B	joint effort man
A	mm yeah
B	you do the typey typey and I'll do the sayey stuff
A	you would know how to do it actually cos you do English too
B	yeah
A	you could potentially write it for me if you if you were alone
B	it would be very shit but it would be
B	it would actually get written
A	yeah
B	I mean you'd probably do a better job of it
A	I
B	but
A	I promise you I would not like do not have any
B	and I'm quite good at writing shit about poetry
A	yeah there you go
B	because poetry is my field
A	exactly like you were a poet you know this shit I don't
B	and our teacher made us
A	I hate poetry
B	like recommend sorry my teacher
A	yeah
B	made us learn all the poetic terms so
A	and just think it'll be like essay practice
B	yeah
B	and you know it's you you know about stuff like iambic pentameter and all that
A	mm
B	a little bit don't you? like the
A	if I really try and remember
B	the rhythm like I'm better at doing the like the imagery and all that kind of shit
A	yeah
B	and the themes
A	yes you you could
B	and all that
A	just like analyse it for me that would be
B	yeah we'll annotate it
B	we'll annotate the poems
A	yeah
B	we'll print some out
B	and annotate them
A	completely dense about this sort of thing like I can't analyse poems and I'm
B	are they in books?
A	yes it's in
B	or are they written down?
A	it's in my horrible massive bible book
B	okay
A	that has like fifty thousand pages
B	I'll read it then you read it and then we'll form a joint opinion
A	well no I don't actually no
B	or look at Sparknotes as well
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	okay that's
B	Moodle
A	I hate going on Moodle it just freaks me out a bit
A	check my emails again I think I feel like er if I do it really like every so often it gets less scary because
B	yeah
A	I'm doing it more often
B	you're doing it friend
A	oh
B	come on
A	okay there are two new emails shit
B	don't
A	no one cares
B	nobody cares
B	what are you looking for then?
A	this stupid laptop lost it oh I don't know
B	you'll find it where is it?
A	I hope so
B	what other requirements are there for the sonnet? it so it's compare two sonnets or three sonnets?
A	I don't know like it doesn't tell you on the page for the essay like see it here it says essay one and you'd expect it to be be some like details about it
B	okay essay one
A	but then all you get is this
B	oh oh oh
A	there's some
B	I've got an idea go go back cos this is the way mine are if you go on
A	where?
B	part one handbook
A	oh yeah oh I do have one of those like physically somewhere
B	it'll have your assignments in
A	oh I see that's right
B	I think
A	clever
B	clever
B	on one of the pages
A	yeah
B	and there should be some detail about what you have to do for it
B	hopefully if not then
A	oh no why did I do that? no

B	no
A	oh
B	cos it'll give you a
A	I hate them
B	it'll give you the
A	comparison of sonnets it just says that that's just what it said on everything that I've got about it complete your sonnet comparison essay
B	begin your reading
A	I mean I imagine they said something about it in a seminar I've missed
B	compare two I I've got erm I'll ask thingamajig on Tinder cos he does English remember?
A	who?
B	that guy
A	oh yeah
B	or I'll ask

A	no I'll be able to find it I just need to have a look round I do have it
B	I did my
A	I dunno like I think I might have just been making that up like I never had any erm actual
B	I'll type it in on Yik Yak now and just be like
A	mm
B	oh here we go
A	the
B	oh okay
A	the actual information
B	manners are important
A	do they want that? oh here we go
B	we can search the sonnet genre
B	so it's two thousand words?
A	it is
B	okay
A	it is indeed
B	discuss the ways in which the two poems engage with the sonnet form ways in which they challenge or conform to the conventions of the genre okay first we need to find out about what the sonnet form is okay? and what what it usually is like
B	yeah mm mm
A	erm I'll just have to look up some notes or something and
B	just read the poems again
A	yeah
B	first thing and then do it
A	choose one of the following pair of sonnets so where
B	somebody's put on Yik Yak university's easy it's like riding a bike and the bike is on fire and the ground's on fire
B	and everything's on fire because you're in hell
A	yeah
B	true true too true
A	mm
B	life is too hard
A	it actually scatters my brain out just even doing that small little thing I just did then
B	but you still did it
A	but I feel really
B	and you didn't die yeah
A	my brain is like not happy with this
B	but still you did it and you did not die
A	mm I know
B	and plus
A	oh god I won't finish it tomorrow I doubt that
B	no but if you did if you got to
A	yeah that's the thing I think like once I've once I've started writing something it will be a lot easier to finish it than just having written nothing at all
B	mm
A	and then I could just do an all nighter on Thursday and get it done
B	you could you could
B	when was the
A	yeah and then I've got one due next week as well that I haven't done wait no what week are we in now?
B	week seven
A	oh shit yeah it is next week for fuck's sake oh
B	fun fun fun
A	a seminar on Thursday about that I suppose I'll find out then what I've gotta do
B	that sounds
A	I need to do that over the weekend or something I don't know I mean cos I have if it's not due on Monday which I hope it isn't I've got like I've got like Friday night Saturday night Saturday in the day and night and Sunday
B	mm mm
A	the day and the night and then
B	mm
A	Monday I'm like off I don't have anything on Monday anyway so
B	that's cool
A	I could work through Monday if needed to oh just yeah so it's not like completely dire at the moment but it would be if I didn't know what I was doing there
B	mm
A	but then I could just get another extension on that
B	you could but
A	this is the beauty of being like all fucked up
B	at least people know now
A	yeah
B	like it's not like oh
A	you could get extensions too if you're struggling
B	I mean personally in terms of actually working for some reason like it's not affecting my work that much
A	no that's really good
B	I don't know why it's not affecting my work that much but it isn't it maybe it's cos I'm using work as a vice to kind of
A	yeah
B	not think about shit
A	I think cos you just did it it last year and you're just maybe better at working than I am
B	no no I I was shit last year I was awful when I before I dropped out of uni last year
A	mm
B	but yeah
A	yeah everyone
B	because
A	seems to be talking about it
B	er I think it's a bit early isn't it? like
A	yeah
B	a smidgen early I mean most people didn't do it sort it out till Christmas
A	I mean we
B	at my last uni
A	at the erm survey thing the other week they talked about that and how apparently people are just like getting really paranoid about houses now and that you you don't have to do this quickly
B	yeah
A	like you can wait until after Christmas
B	mm
A	and I feel like some people have to cos not everyone's like made
B	their mind up about uni
A	very good friends or who or who they're gonna live with and all of that like
B	yeah exactly
A	if I didn't have you lot I'd be completely fucked cos I have no other friends
B	yeah yeah exactly
A	so I'd be like who am I gonna live with next year?
B	if you stay
A	I don't think we should worry
B	we should all go together next year
A	oh yeah absolutely
B	definitely
A	yeah I'm a hundred percent living with you next year
B	yeah yeah
A	I don't have anyone else
B	definitely
A	oh yeah
B	I think it would be nice just to have like a little place
A	it would
B	use that as motivation
A	yeah cos you don't need yeah that's true and you don't need
B	yeah
A	so
B	yeah
A	you know any of your friends who might be up
B	want to join up
A	for that
B	yeah
A	you know
B	I've had some people ask me so yeah
A	I expect erm yeah so just just say yeah sure
B	like we'll all go in together
A	the more the merrier cos less rent lol
B	that's true actually
A	and try and find
B	the more
A	someone rich who can pay the Sky TV
B	yes
A	that'll be nice
B	how much is Sky TV?
A	a lot
B	like twenty-five pounds a month?
A	I don't know maybe but you can get a deal and then you can get Sky broadband but I wouldn't get Sky broadband cos it's
B	no
A	really shit
B	yeah
A	you can get Virgin TV cos Virgin broadband is good
B	yeah we could
A	it would be so fun
B	could
A	if we actually did this and then we'd have like a little house together
B	oh my god
A	so are you not
B	that would be exciting
A	gonna stay in college then? cos I thought you might want to do that
B	I don't know cos er
A	well don't feel like you're pressured to cos
B	no cos I'd rather live with people I like than stay in the college
A	yeah
B	like it's not a big deal to me
A	no
B	it's just like
A	yeah
A	you do get less I think in the second year
B	yeah
A	because people know that like you you live off campus mostly
B	cos yeah I guess you'd go in and then come for the day and then
A	yeah well that's the thing really and then it's good because you like actually spend a day and then because you've got nothing er better to do you end up just working like that's what my sister said
B	mm
A	erm I mean she had a car so it's quite it's a little bit different
B	oh yeah
A	so it's easier for her to like get around
B	she could get around that's good
A	and also she liked walked to campus sometimes cos it was really close by but because we're a little bit further like we'd have to be in town and whatever and you'd have to get the bus
B	mm
A	so you would end up just spending the day and probably going to the library and like doing work or something
B	two fifty a day man
A	I know I would probably get a bus pass next year though
B	yeah yeah
A	cos you're gonna be saving on like other things like rent will be way cheaper like rent here is apparently really cheap
B	that is good actually
A	cos we just think we're like paying a lot of rent for this
B	yeah we're paying
A	so we'll be like paying a lot less
B	like a hundred and sixteen a week
A	yeah we'll be paying a lot less next year
B	so technically that would probably like the price of it would
A	I mean I know you have
B	that's cool
A	like bills and stuff but then when you're in the house with like
B	sometimes it's all inclusive
A	sometimes yeah it would be good if you could get that but I mean that's mm I dunno
B	bills are scary because like what if you use too much of something?
A	I know it's it's just scary cos I don't know how all that works I
B	no
A	have no I have no idea how to sort that out with the landlord like how to get a house or anything
B	like what if we're using too much? what ah
A	like the way
B	yeah
A	my sister did it she just seemed to like do it with her friends and she didn't have any like outside help from the uni or something to get a house they just did it
B	mm
B	I know
A	maybe
A	no but like if yeah
A	too fiddly
B	if my wrist actually works er
A	oh yeah it's gonna hurt do it with the other hand
B	there we go
A	it's quite small
B	hold that with that hand
A	this bit?
B	and then yeah yeah hold that and I'll
A	oh it's so fiddly there we go
A	I can't see
B	there we go
A	yes
B	yay it's in
A	oh
B	excellent
A	thank you
B	I hate putting bracelets on
A	I know I just so infuriated with it
B	oh
A	I've got so much bling
B	bling bling
A	just need my ears pierced and that's it
B	oh you've not got your ears pierced?
A	no I did have and then I took them out cos I had like I didn't have an infection I just like got scared I would get an infection
B	mm
B	it does hurt it does hurt
A	when you've just got them done no one tells you that
B	it can be pretty painful to be honest
A	yeah my friends have got like nose rings and stuff I'm like that does that not hurt?
B	oh my god
A	the funny thing is my mum would never let me get like a nose ring or a tattoo or anything
B	would she not?
A	but there would be nothing she could
B	no
A	do about it though
B	oh my god
A	all
B	would she shout at you?
A	she wouldn't be able to do anything yeah but so what? like
B	she couldn't actually
A	she'd have no
B	she actually do anything
A	exactly
B	you could get a tattoo if you wanted to
A	I could I could I was thinking about getting a little comma cos I like commas and apparently they are symbolic of
B	it's not
A	I don't know
B	over
A	mm
B	continuing
A	oh is that what it is?
B	yeah
A	oh no that's really cheesy I thought it was just
A	a nice symbol
B	okay you don't want that anymore
A	no that's a bit shit no like a semicolon that's bit rubbish no I didn't what would I get?
B	you should get erm
A	I'd just probably get like a little moon like a little crescent moon
B	that's really nice
A	yeah cos I do sometimes draw crescent moons on my wrist
B	that's really cute I know people that get like
A	oh cute
B	like little cats and all that
A	that would be so cute
B	I'd like a a hairbrush tattoo
A	I my god imagine
B	like
A	like a little hairbrush on your arm
B	it's just like yeah
A	little black and white hairbrush
B	just remember him forever kind of thing
B	like just having them on my ankle or my arm
A	but then when he dies you'll be sad
B	I know but I'll be like I had that cat
B	and he was lovely
A	yeah
B	but yeah
A	no I think I'm too much of a wimp to get a tattoo to be honest it's so permanent and it hurts
B	yeah I know I always said I'd get a tattoo if I ever published a book
A	oh
B	when I was younger
A	that's a good idea
B	like I'd do it on that condition
A	mm
B	so I might do it as a milestone but
A	you wanna
B	you never know
A	publish a book
A	do you know what it's about? it is about connections just make sure you have a friend
A	once you're out of here who is like
B	in the
A	connected to that
B	business
A	sort of
B	yeah
A	business yeah like a publisher someone like in a magazine or just anyone to do with that
B	and then
B	they'll get you places
A	yeah
B	I've already got connections from my old uni I know
A	oh there you go
B	writers
A	there you go
B	I know writers
A	stay in touch
B	and people yeah I am in touch with them
A	schmooze schmooze your way through it
B	I'm not a Sim
A	I know that's where the schmooze word comes from
A	but it's actually a word okay?
B	schmooze
A	that people legitimately use sometimes
B	yeah yeah I
A	oh I miss Sim I wanna play Sims
B	I have to
A	I'm gonna play so much Sims
B	yeah
A	when I get home
B	me too
A	mm
B	I've got Sims 4
A	have you?
B	yeah
A	I haven't tried Sims 4
B	it's quite
A	is it any good?
B	it's interesting it's fun to make Sims I think it's less fun to play than other ones
A	oh
B	because only because if you've only got I've only got the original Sims 4 I've not got
A	mm
B	like expansion packs
A	mm yeah I didn't have any expansion packs I always had Sims 3
B	I got them all
A	like just
A	I was too poor for everything else
B	I got a
A	oh
B	it was really
A	nice
B	yeah I
A	nice
B	but yeah it was nice it
A	yeah with The Sims I always like I spent ages like making the family and making the house really nice and then I'd just get really bored playing with it like you know
B	mm
A	and then I just don't play it again for six months
B	oh my god
A	that was just how you played Sims
B	it's like you binge it for three days
A	everyone was like that
B	straight
A	yeah
B	and then you don't touch it for another few weeks
A	you really do but when you're on it you're like shit I've been on this for like eight hours today
B	it's actually quite scary how addictive
A	it is
B	games like that are
A	mm
B	because he keeps
B	coming online and coming offline but he doesn't actually see my thing so maybe
A	no
B	it's it's like three in the morning in erm thingamajig
A	does it say you're online when you're on it?
B	it says I'm online but it says he he said he was he was online briefly for like one minute like
A	oh
B	an hour and a half ago but then it was like two in the morning so maybe he just went on for and went to sleep I don't know
A	yeah that's probably set at the different times he
B	cos he is replying that's the thing like
A	yeah
B	he replies from about eleven o'clock to three o'clock
A	mm
B	in today's time and then he's usually absent so I have to get him in that
A	what at night?
B	timeframe in the day
A	in the day yeah
B	so that's his like evening when he's come in from work
A	oh okay well just send him another text tomorrow
B	yeah
A	at that time yeah
B	and be like have you done it?
A	that's my money bitch
B	cos I yeah
A	yeah
B	and they shouldn't have charged me that much for because I left like how many days? like eight days before the end of the course?
A	yeah
B	erm but
A	but just remember though it's not your fault
B	yeah
A	like it's not
B	yeah
A	your responsibility to pick up the money for this like it's completely
B	yeah
A	their responsibility cos they
B	I know
A	have made the mistake here you should get that appeal because your case is just like it it makes sense
B	mm
A	erm yeah and you've got loads of evidence you've got like
B	and I technically finished lectures
A	yeah you
B	like I'd finished uni it was just that deadline was because the coursework was gonna be handed in
A	mm
B	so yeah
A	no it's totally unfair like I don't just don't worry about the money
B	mm
A	but I know it's hard to say that because it's a lot of money but
B	I know it is I always say that but it's it's difficult isn't it?
A	but I mean you you would have you have you got the overdraft yet?
B	yeah
A	have have you done that?
B	I've I've
A	you've done that?
B	I've done the erm
A	oh good was it easy to do?
B	I've converted it to a student account but I've not applied
A	yeah
B	for the actual overdraft yet
A	oh okay you should do cos
B	do you need? well
A	better safe than sorry
B	yeah does is it pretty quick?
A	mm yeah
B	okay cos I I won't need it till like after Christmas but still I'll do it
A	I mean well cos have you got any money in that account in the student account that you've got now?
B	yeah
A	cos
B	okay
A	like you don't necessarily need to like
B	yeah I've got like
B	a hundred and fifty or something
A	yeah okay
B	I'll try and like and when that guy puts his money in hopefully
A	yeah
B	like it'll happen
A	which yeah it should
B	I'll I'll I think I'll stop freaking out when that guy puts some money in I think
A	yeah
B	I'll relax but you know you don't know
A	mm
B	he's gonna cos he sounds genuine and he's not like being
B	he just he he's asked me for information and he's saying that he'll do it and oh like maybe he's already done it and it's sending it now
A	it'll just take a while cos it's a different country
B	abroad yeah
A	yeah
B	it's not the end of the world
A	it's not the end of the world
B	it's not the end of the world
A	and you will still be able to you know sort it out erm you know there are ways round it I'm sure
B	oh tomorrow's gonna be a long day isn't it?
B	oh my god
A	yep I knew that one I saw that as well it's so annoying
B	for international students what?
A	what?
B	let's go to frigging Germany
B	German exchange
A	we're not twinned with any German universities though
B	aren't we?
A	we've only got some like random ones in Malaysia and one in America I think but it's not a very good one in America I did look it up
B	that's really annoying
A	cos I would quite like to go a year abroad but then you don't do much work and you have to do another year usually and it's
B	really?
A	like any less time is er any more spent
B	my god
A	mm
B	I don't know if it'll worth the
A	oh no but it is no but it would be so worth it cos it would be like your only chance to go abroad
B	yeah
A	cos
B	in your life
A	you really you can't really travel like cos we don't have any money
B	yeah
A	likewise and this is such a good opportunity
B	I'd
A	cos
B	cos
A	you'd be protected by your university and they give you funding as well no they don't give you funding but you're you get an allowance I think like
B	yeah
A	the way you do here
B	I thought that you
A	yeah they do like it's like student finance I think I'm not really sure how it works but you don't have to cover the cost yourself not at all
B	mm
A	and you know you just it's it just sounds like a good opportunity
B	yeah it's cool
A	I'd really like to do it the annoying thing was that I was gonna go like in the really early stages of this clearing thing I was actually gonna go to
B	really?
A	and Venice and
B	in first year?
A	Florence
B	or
A	in first year
B	wow
A	cos it was history of art and English like those at the same time and I think that would have been so much fun to go to Rome for a couple of months not not
B	that's really cool
A	just Rome like all of Italy for three months like go on a little tour look at all the art I would have loved that
B	that's crazy
A	I know
B	some universities offer so much like more
A	yeah they really do
B	than others you know
A	cos
B	no it's not
A	it's just not really that prestigious it's just quite modest it doesn't like shout about itself and yeah I just sometimes I wonder whether that would have been better for me
B	mm
A	doing history of art as well
B	yeah yeah
A	cos that's more in my comfort zone I think
A	no I really didn't know about it until last year cos my friend went
B	mm
A	who who went to my primary school
B	yeah yeah
A	like
B	you said
A	like
B	did you look from pictures on the website of it and stuff?
A	erm
B	not really or
A	no I didn't really I just looked at league tables
A	at the moment cos I'm really shallow like that
B	ah
A	you see it's just cos my sister went to
B	what to kind of like compete with her?
A	yeah
A	cos I don't wanna be known as the shit sister
B	you're not the shit sister
A	no but I am really er in
B	why?
A	context like cos she goes to a better university and she does well like at university she does better than me in most things in life
B	yeah but she's probably had her own problems as well
A	yeah no she has but it's just I dunno yeah I just didn't wanna go to some shitty university
B	like everybody has moments in their life when they kind of thrive and find it easier and I know
A	yeah
B	yeah erm I guess some people it feels like they've been like that all their lives like they've just found it easier generally like
A	mm
B	whereas my sister found it easier throughout school life but she struggled when she got to sixth form kind of thing
A	mm
B	so I found A Levels easier but
A	is she in her second year then?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	she's at A2 now and she's finding it really hard
A	so you're two years older than her as well?
B	yes
A	yeah that's like me and my sister
B	two year gap
A	mm
B	yeah
A	like we used to be so like not friends
B	distant almost
A	yeah
B	the thing is when I was when I was really little we used to play together a lot and then there was like a time when was like twelve what sorry when she was twelve and I was fourteen and we were just kind of like we didn't really get on
A	yeah
B	but now she's kind of sixteen no she's seventeen well okay she's seventeen and I'm nineteen
B	yes that's right we're kind of I don't know we share like she's grown up so
A	yeah
B	I hate to say that but she has
B	so we kind of
A	did you used to be like a mean sister? a mean
B	oh yeah definitely
A	oh cos I just thought that was my sister but apparently everyone does it
B	I was mean I could be mean
A	I didn't like being the little sister it was difficult
B	it is difficult for
A	you don't know
B	no it is I can tell cos I was
A	you're not a little sister though
B	no but I know
B	because
A	yeah exactly
B	but yeah I
A	mm
B	the younger sister has it hardest cos like
A	she was so mean to me
B	see my sister was younger sister and the middle child so she felt a bit
A	oh
B	left out of things
A	yeah
B	because my brother was like the favourite cos he was the youngest and
A	yeah
B	I was the eldest
A	yeah
B	mm
A	yeah I always got babied and favouritised
B	favouritised
A	favouritism from my mum
B	ah
A	but now I kind of hate my mum
B	did she like?
B	do you get on when you're like around each other?
A	er no not really
B	no
B	you just no don't get on
A	we actually don't at all
B	no I don't really
A	ever
B	get on with my mum
[ANNOTATION]	B has a very nice relationship with both their progenitors.	Contradiction
A	but I never have conversations with her just like as two people cos she doesn't seem like that like I'm just her annoying daughter who just drives her up
B	to be honest like
A	yeah
B	all my family talk about with me is their
A	yeah
B	ask me what's going on in my life
A	I know same
B	like
[ANNOTATION]	Her mom and her have tried counseling before.	Neutral
A	but
B	and when they ask what's going on like they always want to hear what's wrong with my life
A	yeah and I I just
B	it's really bad
A	sometimes wanna have just like a normal conversation
B	yeah about
A	with you about like
[ANNOTATION]	Conversations with moms are always so long.	Neutral
B	shit
A	something going on in the news or something just like happening
B	mm
A	in your life perhaps and
B	oh my god I yeah but
A	god forbid we talk about someone else for once like
B	parents like
A	yeah that's it
B	and putting it on their children
A	and my mum does this twenty questions things like if I've been out to like a party with friends or something she gets like really excited about it
B	oh my god
A	like
B	it's like a big event in your house
A	and it's such a big event I know and then she'll like ask me so many questions like so what was it like? how many people were there? what were all of their names and their second names and their sisters and brothers' names and
[ANNOTATION]	Once, A's mother actually asked her child thirty one questions about a party.	Neutral
B	that's funny
A	it's just it just gets ridiculous like honestly
B	I'm so tired
A	yeah I actually feel tired now
B	that's good that's a good sign
A	I know it is
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A's mum is very interested on what their children do because she's bedbound and bored.	Neutral
