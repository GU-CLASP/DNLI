B	right I've got er I've a Groupon voucher erm where I pay twenty-five euros I can have four people eating at
A	what is
B	burger place in in town in
A	in
B	mm
A	mm that's good
B	yeah thing is it might be hard to do it for your birthday
A	yeah I don't think I don't think we could do it for my birthday I think McDonald's would be more simple
B	yeah
A	cos at McDonald's you only really need a euro you can just get a hamburger
A	yeah
B	er
A	yeah
B	no
A	okay so then it could be me you
B	yeah that's for twenty-five euros that's not bad is it? I mean I'm not quite sure how much you can have from that can't remember erm
A	is it like you can get
B	no I don't think I don't think erm
A	like you can get like goujons and that's all for free if you know what I mean
B	right don't do this I'm gonna show you how to cook rice
A	okay
B	just so that you'll know at one point but not now maybe using the cooker
A	okay
B	cooker is a bit funny sometimes the gas goes on and off and I just I'd rather not especially with
A	mm
B	erm actually what? best way is to get a cup
A	that doesn't look like a lot of rice
B	I know it's hard to judge cos it does get double the size when it's cooked or maybe even more
A	does it? ah
A	oh okay yeah
B	and have you brushed your teeth?
A	I have
B	you sure? I can't smell it
A	I'm sure I'm sure mum I have
B	okay
A	can you not hear me? cos I'm pretty sure I'm always up at the same time as you
B	right now with
A	yep
B	pour that in pour that in the saucepan
A	okay so pour about a third of rice and
B	yeah that's probably too much to be honest and then go and fill up
A	it might be
B	fill up the water
A	with the kettle?
B	no fill up fill up that with cold water
A	like to the brim?
B	to be to be the same amount of the as the rice
A	do you mean like a third?
B	yeah whatever the rice went up to put that up to
A	oh
B	okay er that's as much water you need
B	put it on the thing this
A	so I will go
B	yeah
A	so so how do you how do you turn on
B	so it's three thirty-five but you have to watch it because it boils over really quickly
A	how do you turn on the thing? cos all you just did is click the
B	you put put it in and turn it that puts the gas on
A	yeah
B	and you ignite it
A	and then that's that?
B	yeah so you've gotta like not just leave it without putting the ignition on otherwise the gas is erm gas is dangerous without being ignited
A	so you've gotta gotta be like this and then you go like this this and then click that
B	it er it's the other way I think
A	or whatever
B	mm it's this
B	with this rice you have to move it cos it's very difficult
A	oh okay
B	er
A	so how do I do that? do I just go like
B	well it doesn't really work very well on this oven that's why I
A	oh
B	right
A	do you want me to lower it? do I just do this again?
B	don't do no that's off now put it on again
A	this this way?
B	yeah it's got a small
A	oh yeah so that's really low?
B	mm
A	and that's high?
B	yeah turn it on again turn it off and turn it on again
A	oh okay
B	turn it off again so what I have to do is when that boils cos er otherwise it makes a great big mess as well
A	mm
B	and rice can burn
A	so can you only tell by doing a clock from like fifteen to zero? or can you tell by like certain like noises? so if I didn't have a timer could I tell when it was ready?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	mm
A	how low?
B	that's fine
A	okay
B	right right to right to then move that to that one
A	oh which way? this way?
B	that way
A	okay
B	you didn't turn that all the way
A	what do you mean?
B	you didn't turn it all the way that way
A	oh
B	you didn't turn it all the way down
A	oh is that
B	it's very very
A	is that piece broken?
B	yeah that's why that's why it's very hard to use
A	oh
B	it's er quite easy to
A	I thought that was I thought that way the
B	yeah erm
A	is that fifteen minutes?
A	oh
B	it's not fifteen minutes until it boils
A	okay
B	and this is called simmering
A	simmering
B	simmering is when it's bubbling like this
A	shall I use two hands when putting it to a different one?
B	it's always best to use like a more like to keep steady depends how confident you are if you're maybe at first use two hands and always keep the
A	yeah
A	mm
B	you know like that kid at school that had burns or something? do you or was that from a firework?
A	that's from a firework that was from a firework his name was
B	god poor thing
B	that's so sad it was from a firework
A	yeah it wasn't
B	just one moment you know?
A	it wasn't so bad it was just like he had like a bit that's stitched up there he's fine now
B	oh right oh is he?
A	fine yeah of course
B	well er what's
A	oh the I'm pretty sure that's he was just born with that
B	oh okay
A	yeah I don't really know cos I didn't really wanna ask him about it cos obviously that's a bit rude
B	yeah not until you know somebody
B	sometimes if you know somebody then it's okay to ask
A	yeah I do know him but he's he's a bit shy
B	yeah he is quite shy actually isn't he?
A	mm
B	no
A	no
B	that's the trouble I think I worry a bit about people like him cos you're if he only feels like not unconfident on the Xbox he
A	mm
B	so these jellyfish they can just keep going and going I mean I don't know if it's
A	so but if someone stabbed it all the time
B	I suppose so yes yeah yeah
A	cos jellyfish don't really have like mouths or anything so when
B	erm I don't know
A	because er when I when erm cos I was on a beach once erm and there's there was like it was weird because it was like there was the main beach here then there was like a rock
B	yeah
A	then there was like a beach there but when the tide went in that wasn't a beach so you had to like go around it you had to go in like kind of half the sea but you were just it was just like up here
B	mm
A	so you go onto the beach and it'll be like this and
B	mm
A	it's really cool erm but there was jellyfish on it and they looked like just little pieces of jelly seafood jelly on the floor
B	yeah
A	and are they dead? cos I really I was watching once I stepped on one
B	yeah you've gotta be careful cos they could sting you as well
A	well those ones weren't
B	yeah
A	yeah bluebottles and boxer jellyfish
B	box not boxer box jellyfish
A	oh I was thinking of dogs
B	they're in Australia
A	yeah
B	I mean you can't you can't swim in the sea in the summer because is it summer? or is it winter? I think it's the summer you can't
A	I'm pretty sure it's summer yeah cos
B	because of the box jellyfish
A	how how big? like as big as me?
B	er no I
A	so like by bigness cos I don't know if all jellyfish are like this but they're like look all pancake blobs and then they have some of them have like little seaweed things coming down from there am I right? yeah?
B	yeah
A	yeah erm
A	er so do boxer jellyfish have those stingy things?
[ANNOTATION]	Person A is not sure what jelly fish is	Neutral
B	yeah
A	they're the thing that sting you
B	I think so yeah so
A	yeah
A	I put it on for four point
B	four minutes
A	erm
A	oh
B	you know how to look at that?
[ANNOTATION]	Person B knows that jelly fish is stings	Entailment
A	if it's the eighth is it still bad?
B	erm well I wouldn't do chicken or pork or anything like that meat is one of the things you've got to worry about
A	cos I'm not sure it's
B	and fish
A	I'm not sure it's
A	what's the
B	yeah you can yeah mm that's okay but generally I wouldn't erm do you understand these
[ANNOTATION]	Person B said eating pork and chicken and anything like meat it is ok	Entailment
A	mm
B	your energy
A	mm calories and things
A	two thousand for an average
[ANNOTATION]	Person A said that the calories of that is around two thousand	Entailment
B	really? I thought it was like I thought it was less
A	I'm pretty sure it's two thousand or it's twelve hundred
A	fourteen percent wait the fourteen percent or the calories?
B	the calories
A	two hundred and eighty-four
A	is it fourteen percent? or is it fourteen percent of chicken tikka masala is that much calories?
B	no this is the whole thing will be fourteen percent of your daily intake and it's that's
[ANNOTATION]	Person B is going to do some hair cut	Contradiction
A	yeah
A	so fourteen point eight grams?
B	suppose it's just hard to think well is that okay? is that too much? and that's so that's really handy
A	oh
B	twenty twenty-one percent of
A	so that's what that means I thought it was just like twenty-one percent of this has that much fat
B	no
A	I was thinking why would I want twenty-one percent?
B	do you know what saturates are?
A	erm no but it does ring a bell that name
B	it's type of fats butter
A	oh
B	is for example is a saturated fat
A	well there's not much sugar
B	eight percent oh that's actually still quite high for something that's not sugary it's like a chicken tikka masala
A	how much is an apple? do you think?
B	an apple?
A	cos apples are actually quite sugary well fruits are
B	mm I don't know
A	fruits are very sugary
B	what's so interesting is there look at the salt
A	that's a lot of salt
B	twenty-eight percent if you had this and loads of
A	well I guess this is this is kind of a lunch or dinner meal so
B	yeah I know but it's interesting isn't it?
B	yeah
A	like that's what the percentage means
B	and that's where you can see there that the chicken breasts so where where would where would the saturated fat would be
A	onions?
B	that would be the unsalted butter
A	mm
B	don't let it put you off onions it just means
A	no of course I'm gonna eat it
B	look at all the nice spices though cumin coriander lemon paprika turmeric
A	mm
B	don't you recognise? I mean these are the kind of the main curry spices you should know about this if you like curry
A	I love curry can we buy these spices?
B	cardamom ginny ginger
A	I'd put them in
B	yeah I mean er sometimes I do
B	or a wok and
A	the only thing I'm scared about is I'm very very very picky with sauces some sauces I hate some sauces I adore like chicken tikka masala
B	yeah
A	so how?
B	right let's see if they're
A	yeah it looks ready
B	so we turn if you turn it off if you take your thing out of the microwave to cool down you can just take it out with your hand I think it'll be alright just
B	do you know why? cos it can be quite soggy rice
A	oh yeah
B	but if you leave it there see all the steam rising up with the lid off? it's just drying all the rice flakes
A	that's yeah yeah yeah that's cool
A	is it?
B	yeah you don't
A	did you stab it before it went in?
B	yeah I did yeah otherwise it would've been trying to explode in there
A	oh yeah
B	cinnamon bay leaves nutmeg chilli
A	my favourite spice is jalapeño jalapeño
B	jalapeño
A	I really like the taste of it I didn't actually like it at first I hated jalapeños I like the spice of jalapeños I liked but I hated the taste
B	yeah
A	if you know what I mean do you know what I mean?
