A	yeah yeah
B	they never feel the cold do they?
A	no no no they don't he's always really he walks around
B	yeah blankets on
A	well he's yeah it used to be so until the last year or so and then now it's er
B	well I suppose as well cos you're at home
A	yeah
B	too so
A	yeah
B	more sort of
A	yeah that's it
B	yeah
A	now I've got this little but I need to do we we went out for a walk on Sunday
B	right
B	oh yeah
A	we walked there and walked all the way round and down by the river and back round and long and
B	so it's a nice circuit that isn't it?
A	yeah yeah just did that and we said cos we we used to go out regularly we used to walk you know three or four times a week we'd just go out round
B	yeah then it's like can I be bothered? no not really you only live round the corner from
A	yeah yeah yeah this is it
B	well saying that I went down there the other day cos I haven't got a dog anymore so I sort of felt like a bit of an idiot
A	ah no
A	did you have the kids with you? did you have the kids with you?
B	yeah we had the kids with us so we had the buggy and
A	yeah
B	might be a bit cold so any changes from last time?
A	no
B	no?
A	no
B	okay is there anything you want me to do differently or?
A	no it was fine it was really nice
B	no? you enjoyed it whatever I did
A	yeah I enjoyed it and it's it was nice I know you said afterwards you were worried about if I wasn't relaxing or anything but
B	yeah
A	I think I was quite happy just chatting and having it done and afterwards I could really feel that it had been done
B	that's probably what you needed then
A	yes
B	you might need something different today
A	yeah that's right so
B	might you you see so
A	yeah so if I fall asleep today
B	that's absolutely fine I'll go with whatever you want me to do
A	yeah
B	so if you want me to talk if you want to talk to me I'll talk back but obviously I won't erm I'll leave you to relax
A	yeah yeah that's fine
B	okay
A	I think for me if I if I'm doing like things like a facial I like to just relax and chill and just have that done or massage you know that's a real like to me that's pampering
B	yeah
A	whereas for
B	mm yeah so it's doing something actually for your body isn't it?
A	yeah yeah that's right
B	inside
A	yeah that's right
B	okay so let's see right okay
A	erm not as well
B	no
A	I think part of it was building up towards the operation
B	mm
A	and then
B	yeah
A	I think I'm a bit fed up at the minute
B	yeah
A	so I'll keep playing the Scrabble games on the computer
B	yeah
A	and I keep doing this and then I go to bed and I think well actually I might as well just finish
B	well you're not tiring yourself out are you you see?
A	no no I'm not doing anything
B	no
A	I thought that today actually cos I'm like at work we're up a couple of flights of stairs and I'm up and down quite a few times in the day and then if I was going to the toilet rather than going to near one I go down out a different way down two flights of stairs and up just to get walking around a bit
B	yeah
A	but I'm not even doing any of that now
B	mm
A	like
B	so it's just you're watching telly
A	that's what I think I need to do something
B	yeah
A	I'm getting really sluggish
B	I'm surprised you haven't put weight on or anything
A	oh I have I've put on about six pounds
B	have you?
A	which is the other thing I've noticed yeah and it's all here
B	ah it's always there
A	which is
B	that you you know don't want it to go on isn't it?
A	no exactly so if there's anything you can do with getting rid of this bit that'd be lovely
B	well there's
A	bit of liposuction
B	it'll go down afterwards you can bet it
A	yeah yeah it will do
B	mm
A	I know it will
B	you'll get yourself I mean this is just a blip isn't it?
A	yeah
B	such a short time of your life that you're gonna
A	yeah yeah that's it
B	be feeling like that
A	yeah that's it and that's why I think I ought to like I've got a parcel today I think right I really ought to put it in something and walk it down to the post office rather than cos normally
B	yeah you've got time tomorrow and the next day and the next day
A	yeah and the next day yeah
B	cos when you're working it was well I'll better do it today cos I've got work tomorrow
A	yeah exactly
B	and you you're out of your routine aren't you?
A	yeah I sent my boss and think just to say oh it's been cancelled and you know and whatever and she went oh chin up you know enjoy more time off
B	that's nice
A	and I just sent one back saying yeah I just sent one back saying that I'm getting seriously bored now you know it's not all it's cracked up to be you think it oh it's lovely having all this time off work
B	mm
A	but it it really isn't I've been off since May and it's ridiculous
B	yeah it's a long time
A	it is yeah it is
B	that is a long time
A	yeah and you can understand how people never get back in to going back to work because actually you just gets so removed from that day-to-day life
B	yeah
A	and it'll be hard to get back into it so
B	totally you can see how people just get stuck in a rut with it can't you?
A	mm oh yeah
B	and then they've not got the energy to go out and find and job
A	no
B	even if they could do
A	yeah exactly exactly
B	so it's an endless cycle isn't it?
A	mm
B	mm
A	yes see you find oh yes that toe shows you're very bored at the moment
A	that toe shows actually you really ought to be sleeping a bit more but you just
B	cos the first time you came was on the first of the tenth wasn't it? so what are we now the
A	fifteenth
B	no
A	yeah
B	where has this month gone?
A	cos yesterday was fourteen ten fourteen
B	ah
A	I wrote it down a couple of times and though ah that's a good date
B	yeah
A	I know
B	heck it's just flying by
A	yeah it's
B	is it?
A	she's twenty-four
B	she's twenty-four
A	I know
B	I remember when she was when did she used to come unto erm seventeen eighteen?
A	yeah yeah
B	something like that wasn't she?
A	probably yeah yeah
B	seems good though in a good place isn't she?
A	oh yeah she's yeah yeah she is
B	did she enjoy the massage?
A	very much yeah yeah she
B	good
A	she she's been saying for ages I really must go back I really must go back
B	yeah
A	but then because she's always skating and this and that and watching three hundred different television programs
B	has she got like a list of the all the things she watches?
A	ah yeah well she's just got erm we watch it online
B	yeah
A	watch them like so we watch it in line with America
B	ah
A	and she's been she watches all these different shows and then she suddenly thinks oh I'll watch and she starts watching the box sets on Sky and just starts from
B	god
A	she started off with erm Grey's Anatomy
B	yeah
A	started off with the first series cos we're watching it
B	there's a lot of them isn't there?
A	yeah well we've watched it right from the start but she says she thinks she might have missed the first episode or so because I probably said oh this is really good and she started watching it with me then and I've watched it right through but I've actually gone back this week and started watching I've watched the first three episodes
B	what from the beginning?
A	although yeah yeah cos I'm mean it's twenty-odd series so yeah I I think something like that twenty or eighteen
B	when did it start like what year was?
A	ah long time ago I'm not sure
B	flipping heck yeah
A	yeah but I've just found I'm cos I know the story and I can
B	no I've never seen it
A	ah
B	you know what it is I don't like American sitcoms or
A	ah okay
B	I just can't get into them I don't know why
A	yeah yeah
B	I'm just not it doesn't seem to appeal to me for some reason I don't know like people love CSI and CESI or whatever whatever the others you know but no I just cannot get into them
A	yeah yeah yeah well I
B	yeah
A	because I like it cos it's almost like erm chick flick sort of rom-com
B	yeah
A	not rom-com it's not even really funny there's there's funny
B	I like Sex and the City
A	yeah
B	I used to watch that a lot
A	yeah well that's and and it's sort of very the person Meredith who it is she's very matter of fact and she does a voiceover of a couple of bits and and things that happen to patients sort of
B	yeah
A	so somebody'll say something and you can see them thinking ah and that helps them think what they're doing and I'd give it a go
B	yeah
A	if you don't like but it's it's I've recommended it to ah five or six people and they all love it
B	it's such a shame that when I cos I work in the evenings as well when I come in at nine o'clock by the time I've finished all my jobs I never get a chance to do anything watching the telly or nothing
A	no no
B	it's such a shame it's my own fault but you know I
A	yeah I suppose in the day when you're not working you've got the kids
B	the kids
A	yes
B	which you know what that's like
A	yeah yeah
B	you you've got probably erm CBeebies on on Cartoon Network haven't you so?
A	mm
B	yeah mm
A	you'll have to get yourself a routine of a at night
B	shift
A	before you go to bed you sit and watch
B	cos
A	yeah
B	so he's always got what he wants on
A	oh yeah
B	but then he'll say to me well you're out working all day what do you expect me to do? you know
A	yeah
B	I've you know what am I supposed to do while you're in in there in the cabin
A	yeah
B	which is fair enough I suppose by the time he comes I come in he's
A	hoovering ironing?
B	got into something yeah
A	mm is that cos you wouldn't do it right?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	don't even want to I can't even iron it well I've just got used to ironing a crease down a trouser for
B	they just rung me actually and said he's had a nosebleed I said to tell me something I don't know
A	oh does he get them?
B	a lot
A	yeah
B	yeah a lot
A	has he got problems with his tonsils and things like that or is it just?
B	no I don't think so but he has been quite sort of congested up his nose lately and I think sometimes it's just every now and again they say usually people who get nosebleeds are people who get have too much blood
A	oh right
B	I don't know if that's true
A	I don't know
B	I don't know it's probably a load of rubbish
A	as in the body produces too much so yeah
B	too much blood yeah and it has to get rid of it
A	yeah well they say it's like a pressure an outlet isn't it?
B	yeah
A	for for something like that
B	which so it makes sense if you think doesn't it? really
A	yeah
B	he should do some relaxation techniques warm these feet up a bit
B	did he? what when did he grow out of them?
A	erm probably seven or eight
B	so quite late well not too late I suppose but cos did he? does he ever play rugby or anything now?
A	yeah
B	cos he used to didn't he? still does?
A	oh yeah yeah yeah
B	yeah he kept that up
A	yeah yeah he's playing for
B	so what age did he start from?
A	erm oh he didn't start till he was about thirteen
B	oh so he actually did proper rugby it wasn't like tag rugby then?
A	yeah no no he did
B	cos they start about seven don't they?
A	yeah yeah my nephew's just started that and they actually recommended that he started doing it erm he's nine now
B	mm
A	and he's really really sporty into everything and then they actually said he ought to start playing cos he was doing a bit of rugby with school and they said take him up cos it's
B	brilliant
A	they
B	fantastic
A	erm yeah so and he really enjoys it all these different sports
B	yeah sounds like he'll do well at that
A	yeah
B	won't he?
A	well he does football karate and erm rugby now as well
B	mm
A	and he's just been made the sports ambassador at the school
B	has he?
A	yeah apparently here were five or six people they got in touch er the kids with at school and said you know we're
B	and he did
A	so yeah
B	and how he felt and why he thought he'd be good
A	yeah and and he was saying how he loved sports erm and it's really good for you doing sports and it's good for team spirits and he always encourages his friends to play sports because of what you get out of it and how it makes you feel not just because of the fitness erm and he said like he he'd be proud to be an ambassador for the school to er to spread the word
B	great
A	and and all this and yeah and they they said to him yeah they wanted him to be an ambassador so
B	and at such a young age as well that's great
A	yeah
B	well it shows that he's got determination isn't he? and and and er vision
A	yeah
B	to be able to go you know forwards where he wants to go
A	yeah that's it
B	I bet she was
A	cos he was just so saying all the stuff you would say but she said it was like we didn't even have to say anything to him he just went off and did it and came back
B	proud mummy moment that would be
A	yeah exactly she said it was yeah and then when he came back and said yes you know that yeah they they made me the ambassador so
B	yeah
A	but he's been erm in this one of these gifted and talented things for sport that they that they do so she said the last year he's been going off I think it's once a week once a month to different schools to do take part with and it's all the kids
B	yeah
A	you know that have been picked out of these primary schools
B	so do they ever sort get erm a chance to sort of play erm sort of a bit further up the you know the league a little bit in a way?
A	well
B	if they are good at what they do
A	yeah yeah well he's he's playing at
B	yeah
A	and they came over and played
B	yeah
A	and it's obviously you know tag rugby and stuff like that but
B	yeah
A	and
B	you do wonder don't you how they protect themselves as much as they do because it's pretty physical stuff isn't it?
A	oh yeah I mean
B	they just carry on don't they?
A	that's fine but after this last one he said he erm he's hurt his neck a bit erm and he said he actually got kneed in the head by somebody accidently or whatever but got kneed in the head
B	yeah
A	and then something and he said he and he went down and they were saying oh is it a neck injury? cos he was holding his neck and he said no no I'm fine he said jumped up started going round and then he said he was running round thinking where am I going? what am I doing? and they actually took him off for a few minutes
B	he was a bit stunned
A	cos he was a bit yeah erm but then he said ah I'm fine and went back on and he had a headache afterwards but
B	yeah yeah
A	yeah
B	and for days afterwards and I said look you've just got to face it you're too old
A	yeah
B	to play now you're too old
A	yeah you need to get him to the vets and have an easier game
B	yeah you're not yeah definitely
A	yeah yeah
B	because playing against work and he'll be playing erm because he plays for work but what they do is they play like erm local erm er prison service or whatever
A	mm
B	you know and some of them are quite big guys
A	oh yeah
B	I mean
A	no no
B	he's not really that fit to be honest
A	what position does he play?
B	hooker
A	oh right
B	so he's in the scrum isn't it?
A	yeah I think yeah on the edge but I think
A	oh yeah
B	yeah and he's erm
A	yeah
B	he enjoys it I mean he's I think it's more about showing them the discipline of the game to start with isn't it cos they're just running around all over the place
A	yeah it's yeah yeah
B	jumping on the coaches back honestly some of them are little beggars
A	yeah yeah
B	they're naughty and the parents don't say anything
A	no no
B	but he's a nice coach but sometimes I think he does get a bit mad with them
A	yeah I suppose he's letting them
B	just letting them go for a little bit
A	yeah yeah
B	and then all of a sudden
A	yeah yeah yeah I mean rugby is really good with the the discipline of it as you say it's
B	mm
A	you know you you see them like even the adults and stuff and on the all the matches on telly and yes sir no sir to the referee and when the referee says and
B	yeah not like football
A	oh no no
B	totally differently
A	no no
B	yeah so I have a lot of respect for rugby players more than I do football I must say
A	yeah
B	he started playing football
A	yeah
A	yeah I must admit rugby is I I think that with I mean we kept saying that with with
B	did you?
A	yeah he ought to be doing rugby
B	yeah
A	but his dad is an absolute massive football fan
B	is he?
A	oh oh and in fact he played almost like professionally erm until he hurt his knee when he was in his twenties so erm
B	yeah
A	so he's like mad keen on football and he takes takes
B	so it's good that he's into both isn't it?
A	the
B	as well
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	not just preferring the one but I wonder if he ever had to choose between the two what he would choose
A	yeah is dad keeps saying about rugby it's just a phase the boy will grow out of it it's just a phase
B	ah
A	and we all start teasing him no no no no
B	know what I prefer
A	yeah yeah well
A	yeah
B	they're so the way they speak to the kids like get in there take him out take him out
A	oh yeah and if with rugby particularly at like kids' games or ever whatever I mean we've gone and watched
B	yeah absolutely
A	and one the pitch you're not swearing cos there's people you know
B	definitely definitely
A	yeah mm
B	cos erm even you know like you go to rugby matches you can drink while you're watching
A	yeah well we we've been down to Twickenham a few times to watch different things
B	not football
A	and you're all mixed up as well we're all sat next to each other
B	yeah everyone's friendly aren't they? all up for a laugh and a good time watching the match good game
A	yeah yeah that's right and if someone
B	none of them football hooligans
A	no this is it and you have to segregate them and march them to and from the stations and yeah
B	yeah they're just out there to have to cause trouble aren't they?
A	yeah
B	most of the time
A	yeah yeah yeah yeah a lot of them are
B	so
A	I was quite enjoying the pushing on it it's sort of like
B	I'll be on you today with that
B	mm
A	okay
B	because then we can just try and relax you down a little bit
A	start to behave myself and relaxation rather than a
B	yeah get into the zone
A	yes mm
B	even I got a little bit in front of myself them I'll concentrate otherwise I'll miss things
A	like a whole foot
B	yeah
A	yeah yeah
B	okay then so I'd like to you to take a nice deep breath in in through the nose and then out through the mouth
A	is that better?
B	much better much better it just shows what deep breathing does
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	that's your shoulder again
A	yeah
B	yeah is it quite sore?
A	erm not really but it that's just an old injury
B	is it what on that side there?
A	from when I was about eighteen
B	what on your foot? or in your actual shoulder?
A	no in the shoulder
B	oh
A	yeah oh yeah I ripped all the muscle in my shoulder when I was eighteen
B	I remember now
A	yeah that's the one that
B	do you have to go and see
A	yeah
B	yeah you still go? I forgot to ask you actually whether you still went
A	mm yeah just when I need to I don't go all the time
B	yeah
B	I wondered if he's erm retired or anything yet do you think he'll keep on going?
A	no no he's just taken a month off he's gone to Florida they've got a place out there
B	oh right oh nice
A	so yeah he's done that
B	he's done well for himself hasn't he?
A	yeah yeah
B	he's so good at what he does though
A	oh he is
B	I'm only in there five minutes and you come out amazing
A	I got in no I know yeah and he just knows doesn't he? he just sort of says bend here runs his fingers down your back and goes oh yeah you it's so and so
B	yeah
A	yeah that's is that that one as well then is that the shoulder?
B	down the side yeah
A	yeah
A	mm
B	did you go this year?
A	yeah I go every night still
B	yeah you still go the whole
A	yeah yeah
B	I didn't get to go this year
A	no that's painful there
B	that's your lung area in there but then again it runs into your neck which is just in that spot?
A	oh yeah yeah yeah
B	yeah that's your neck
A	yeah so yeah that's it so
B	yeah all under that bit there is your neck
A	yeah
B	it's amazing isn't it? the reflexology
A	yeah
B	yeah I bet you're really aware of what your body is doing
A	yeah yeah
B	sometimes your feet can be
A	mm
B	I'm not hurting you
A	no no not
B	sure
A	yeah no I to be honest if I'm having something done I'd rather have it done properly
B	rather have it rather have it done yeah
A	if I have a massage I I like to really feel it
B	have some firm treatment not be tickled
A	yeah no
B	nothing worse is there?
A	are your hands affected by all the massage you do?
B	no not yeah wrist
A	yeah
B	yeah wrists are erm sometimes I get a few shooting pains but I think after the years of doing it I think I've got used to it
A	mm mm
B	you know? it's more my back I've got a trapped nerve at the moment
A	oh have you
B	so I'm having to have treatment on that yeah cos that's
A	yeah
B	been giving me gyp but erm I went last night so erm it's helped
A	mm
B	but it was giving me gyp
A	I suppose you've always got to be so careful how you bend and what you do cos you spend a lot of time
B	I know and I'm I'm not I just I'm not
A	no
B	up on it I should be but I'm not sometimes I
A	yeah
B	so I'm almost leaning into them for the for the pressure but that isn't really doing my back any good
A	yeah mm mm
B	because I'm bending over too far with the pressure
A	mm could you stand on something have a slight like a long step thing you can put next to the bed?
B	could do cos I mean I come up and down
A	and you were just slightly higher yeah
B	I mean I can lift this up but I don't like them to be too high because I then I feel like I'm not being able to put my pressure through properly
A	mm
B	does that make sense?
A	yeah yeah but if you were actually just standing on something you would actually just be at a different angle and leaning at a different weight onto it
B	yeah that might help try it she said get as close to the couch as possible and then what you do is you're bending from your hips then not leaning over
A	yeah yeah that's the thing you've got to just be really conscious the next so many times you do it to get in a different position and once you do that you'll remember won't you then and?
B	yeah yeah and then it becomes second nature
A	yeah mm
B	no I've been a bit naughty think it doesn't help picking
A	yeah yeah
B	cos you're always picking up kids' stuff on the floor aren't you?
A	oh yeah
B	and all that so that's probably done a lot of it
A	started doing that breathing that you said you know the
B	yes
A	in seven out eleven
B	the seven yeah seven eleven breathing
A	yeah
B	how do you find it?
A	the first the first couple of days I kept remembering and then what I found is if something was maybe a bit stressful I started doing it then and then I did it the next day and then I totally forgot until today that I'd been doing it
B	really? doing it without thinking
A	no no as in I'd forgotten to do it
B	yeah
A	so cos it had just gone out of my mind that I was even meant to be doing it
B	yeah
A	but I thought today right now I must remember and start yeah
B	doing it like just taking yourself off cos you know
A	yeah
B	just practising about
A	I found I was doing it as I was driving
B	yeah
A	cos that was a a good thing thing I'm driving I'll actually get in the routine of doing that
B	good
A	not that driving stresses me but it's just a a routine of something you do quite regularly
B	a time to do yeah
A	yeah yeah
B	and you can still concentrate can't you?
A	yeah that's why I do pelvic floor exercises
B	yeah yes
A	when I'm driving yeah
B	yes cos erm that's really important isn't it?
A	yeah
B	something I should do
A	add it to the lost
B	I don't like doing them I find it weird
A	do you?
B	yeah
A	I remember being about fourteen and reading something it must have been like Jackie magazine or something this is a good idea to get into the habit of doing now girls and I I just started doing them then
B	and that's it
A	and I've I've done it right through my life yeah
B	go
A	and that's what they've always said I've got
B	strong pelvic muscles
A	I've got really good yeah
B	so obviously when you had your babies
A	yeah
B	did you have caesareans or natural births?
A	no no natural just popped them out
B	and they were all okay?
A	yeah I was only in labour two hours which
B	pff
A	and that wasn't even proper labour contractions it was just a dull ache at the bottom of my back
B	what?
A	my waters went went into hospital and sort of said yeah and they were like oh yeah you're only a bit dilated you know and I was waiting for contractions and then I had one and said I think I want to push and they were saying no you can't do cos you know they're on about
B	it had just gone up to ten that quick
A	yeah
B	Jesus
A	yeah and then but in those days they'd take you from one room to the delivery suite
B	mm
A	so they were pushing me in the corridor and I was going I want to push and they were going don't push now cos you'll have the baby in the corridor
A	and I'm thinking well so I was so glad they don't do that now you see they don't move you around so much do they? but
B	no they just put you in one room that's it
A	I probably had about four five six proper contractions and had her yeah
B	brilliant
A	gas and air no stiches no nothing just yeah
B	if you if you could cope and you had all the money you could go on and have ten children if they were all like that couldn't you you'd literally just go
A	yeah exactly yeah well
B	but er was your first wasn't he?
A	he was the second
B	oh
A	no no
B	why I always get them two mixed up I don't know
A	because he's so much bigger than her everybody thinks that
B	I think it's why he's tall isn't he?
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	what car's he got at the minute?
A	er it's a little MX5 convertible
B	is it?
A	yeah scrapes on the floor it's got wheels sticking out at angles his his exhaust's a straight through pipe
A	yeah exactly where is just cos he when he goes comes to pass it he has to stop and wait till nobody's coming so he can go in the middle and go across both speed bumps together
B	yeah
A	so cars start queuing up behind him oh off
B	I bet he gets a bit down
A	yeah
B	did he get rid of the Corsa in the end? cos that's kind of like a car that he did up from the start wasn't it?
A	yeah yeah he's still got it
B	yeah
A	he's sold various bits off it
B	yeah
A	and he's he's saying he'd rather scrap it than give it to somebody who's going to break it up
B	yeah
A	rather than so he's on at putting it on erm he'll need to do that cos he's moving this week
B	is he?
A	this weekend yeah he's erm he's on about putting it on er on the enthusiast page and saying if somebody want to get it to do something with it let me know and
B	yeah
A	but I think he'll end up just scrapping it
B	cos I suppose he won't have enough space on the drive will he?
A	well where he's going now erm yeah he's got there'll be a garage and then there's space for two cars
B	oh okay
A	he's saying he's not going to take it cos he's not gonna do anything with it
B	yeah
A	erm he's got the MX5 he wants to get a a BMW as a to have as a drifter
B	cos he had one of those for a bit didn't he?
A	yeah he did yeah
B	cos I was just seeing what was parked outside yours you see
A	I know
B	so I was like ah
A	oh he's got a new car yeah another new car little red Corsa he had for a while and then something went wrong with that and then somebody wanted to buy it just for the tyres and the wheels on it or something so he sold it to them so I don't know he's just constantly getting new cars and
B	yeah yeah that's what he's that's his little hobby I suppose isn't it?
A	yeah yeah it is yeah yeah
B	and did erm did he get rid of that girlfriend in the end the one that was down south yeah?
A	in Portsmouth? yeah
B	yeah they split up in the end?
A	yeah yeah
B	cos she was wasn't really pulling her weight with coming up was she?
A	no no no she wasn't she kept saying oh we're just friends we'll see how it goes and all that he was like after months and months and months and then in the end she sort of said I can't see you anymore and he said well we'll stay friends and she said yeah and then the next week she put on Facebook all over oh my boyfriend she'd got a new boyfriend and
B	aw
A	and he was just he was devastated actually
B	I bet he was
A	absolutely devastated
B	well that's like a kick in the teeth really isn't it? it's not fair she should have
A	yeah yeah it was she's moved in with this lad now and every now and then she'll pop up and like message
B	yeah good riddance really
A	yeah yeah no that's right
B	there you go that's some girls isn't it I suppose?
A	yeah this is it there was a song out erm around that time and I can't remember which one it was what's
B	oh yeah
A	yeah that one and he's
B	yeah you get a complex don't you?
A	and I was like yeah oh yeah he was really fed up about it and I said no I said the thing is you've got to find the right person you know I said and don't stop treating girls nice because people have done that to you I can't be anything but nice can I? he said and that's right and he can't you know he's a lovely lad
B	and also you know when someone who will you know who who he will meet they'll be the right one and they'll deserve it so and he will meet the right one
A	yeah
B	does he like being in relationship do you reckon more?
A	yeah yeah he does
B	he likes to sort of be secure and
A	he's just yeah he erm
B	you either are or you're not aren't you?
A	I think he said he's talking to a girl in in
B	oh yeah yeah link up and that
A	yeah but he said well you know he said at the minute he's not really got time you know he's got his rugby he's got his gym he's got work and when he works shifts he said it's really hard to see people if you're in a relationship it's alright because you know
B	yeah
A	it's all you
B	they understand
A	exists
B	yeah give it a bit of time maybe that's what he needs really
A	he'll see yeah yeah
B	and
A	no no this is it no I mean he didn't I don't think he was that worried anyway he was just
B	yeah just sometimes it's just nice to talk to the opposite sex isn't it really?
A	yeah yeah I think there was a girl in erm
B	really?
A	and she thought he was older and he thought she was younger and she was sort of well no no and he said but you know it shouldn't matter with age
B	yeah
A	cos he's he's a real steady mature lad and you know then she was like no no we can't but they were they were friends and then she started seeing somebody else and so that's all drifted off now
B	right right
A	you just think he just needs a bit of luck really
B	yeah he does
A	to meet the right person you know erm
B	it's not his time yet though is it maybe
A	no no this is it no
B	it's complicated innit the whole relationship thing?
A	mm yeah
B	it really is
A	yeah it is how did you meet
B	I met him of all places in Yates's
A	oh yeah
B	and erm of all the
A	mm
B	and never met anybody decent they're always yeah I'll give you a call never bothered you know and all that kind of thing
A	yeah
B	and then in the end I'd given up I had given up
A	yeah
B	I'd given up I'd been online that didn't work out
A	mm
B	and erm it was a Bank Holiday Sunday and
A	yeah done
B	let's do
A	not a very nice place anyway to be honest
B	it's rough as anything isn't it?
A	no yeah
B	so they thought oh well this'll be alright so him and another mate moved in to er
A	mm mm
B	yeah but again you know I was sort of think I was about twenty-seven when I met it so I was fed up fed up with idiots
A	yeah yeah
B	met all the wrong kind
A	yeah
B	the ones you like they didn't like you
A	yeah
B	and vice versa
A	the ones you weren't keen on were almost stalking you
B	yeah this is it yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	how did you meet
A	I moved in next door to him
B	did you?
A	mm in
B	where? oh
A	yeah
B	oh so you lived down that end then? cos you were from
A	originally
B	that's right
A	and
B	I knew you were from somewhere like that yeah
A	yeah yeah and they we came to
B	right
[ANNOTATION]	person B understand where is he from	Entailment
A	erm and that's when I came into refuge then
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	person A Iis refuge then	Entailment
A	and moved around and we were placed in
B	they pop you in a house there do they? yeah
A	yeah well I was in the refuge to start but then yeah I got put into this temporary housing in
B	cos
A	no yeah yeah that's right the little cul-de-sac that in that I was in was okay but the rest of the place they were just stripping the houses
B	were they?
A	erm but this one had about five or six people living in it who were permanent residents there and they really look out for each other and so that little bit was left alone
B	yeah that was good then for you wasn't it? obviously wanting a bit of safe housing as well
A	yeah yeah but then then from then I was moved into
B	really?
A	oh yeah it was it was nasty really nasty so that's when I decided I think I'm going to go into private rent I need to sort this out myself because
B	yeah
A	we I was walking the kids up to go and get this the bus they were getting to get to school erm and they were five and six at the time and we were walking past burnt out cars that weren't there the day before and they weren't even batting an eyelid and I was thinking I'm not having my kids thinking this is normal life again
B	mm yeah
A	cos I know it was
B	did you work at at the time?
[ANNOTATION]	person B don't know was where at work or not	Neutral
A	no no no I didn't
B	no you tried to get yourself back to
A	yeah yeah yeah that's it yeah
[ANNOTATION]	person A tired and back yourself	Entailment
B	yeah some sort of you know place really
A	yeah
B	so where were the kids going to school then?
A	I'm got them into erm
B	yeah yeah
A	cos
B	uhu
[ANNOTATION]	kids go to school	Entailment
A	and that again that was really rough erm and I was sort of dropping them off trying to get go back and sort out what I was doing and you know I was getting counselling at the time and erm yeah and it was horrible so I just thought again I don't know where I'm going to be but I'm not dropping the kids off with them coming out saying this you know the boys said they're going to do this and that and
B	yeah
A	do you live within the catchment area? no
B	no
A	et cetera et cetera et cetera and he went on and on and on with all these different things as we were walking round but as we were walking round
B	they were like
A	yeah well they thought yeah okay they were nice polite bright kids and that but
B	yeah that's what we want in the school
A	yeah and he basically said I'm going to have to put this before the governors he said because you don't meet any of the criteria and I said look I said the reason I want them to come to this school I said we've gone through this this and this therefore we're in refuge I'm not sure where I'm gonna get housed but it will be somewhere in
B	yeah
A	and he said I'll see what I can do and and it was the headmaster and he went to the governors and we got accepted in
B	they were really good
A	yeah
B	he is they still go there even when you went to
A	yeah they were still going there then
B	yeah that's good isn't it? they stayed in the same school
A	yeah yeah yeah they kept them there and then when we moved to
B	yeah
A	oh now we're going into the refuge in
B	yeah
A	right the way through and then obviously there was the secondary school after it so they both went we'll go and have a look we'll go and have a look and we went and looked round you know the school and they seemed to like it and they they both said we want to come here we want to be able to walk to school we want to do this we want to of that
B	brilliant
A	so I said okay and that was again they were sort of six and seven age but I just I thought yeah that's fine you know so I went in and thanked the school very much and they said they were really pleased with how they'd got on and they were settled
B	great really come round
A	mm and that was the other reason why when when they were leaving primary school they could've taken the exams to go to
B	yeah
A	and I said to them do you want to take the exams? do you want to go you know you can go to
B	yeah just went with what they wanted to do
A	yeah yeah
B	did they go to
A	yeah they went to
B	was that quite good at the time?
A	yeah it was actually cos I think it had had a time of not being brilliant
B	mm
A	erm and then there was a new headmaster or somebody came in and made it better and
B	yeah
A	yeah I think
B	so they sort of had their last years there okay
A	yeah yeah
B	yeah
A	and I think to be honest school is what kids get out of it
B	yeah
A	I mean when they were really little in
B	absolutely
A	yeah yeah
B	it's a good sports college up there isn't it?
A	yeah yeah
B	up at erm
A	is that where your two will go?
B	I don't know because they are on about building another school over
A	oh are they?
B	which is going to be called
A	okay oh right yeah
B	so
A	mm
B	but you know what will happen there've been far too many houses on
A	no no yeah no but you'll be in the catchment for
B	yes
A	that's another thing cos
[ANNOTATION]	There are very few houses.	Contradiction
B	yeah but that I mean hopefully by that point my mine go to
A	isn't that a very good one no? oh is it oh I don't know
B	yeah
A	I once your kids leave school you sort of you're out the loop a bit
B	you're out you are out the loop yeah I mean the er head he erm I think he was on his way out really but he was just biding a bit of time and erm you know things are just have just got into a bit of a state
A	mm
B	so they're just going in and having to sort it out
A	yeah yeah
[ANNOTATION]	They have nothing to sort out.	Contradiction
B	so but usually after you know they pay so much more attention to it it turns round quite quickly
A	yeah yeah
B	so it's not always a bad thing really
A	no no
B	it's like well in
A	is it?
A	yeah but again it's turning itself round so
A	yeah yeah I think erm years ago school had the same teachers and same head teachers for years and years and years and they were a set school you had your grammars your comprehensives your all girls all boys
B	yeah
A	you know secondary modern schools or whatever and they
B	mm
A	and now everything's all mixed up and chopping and changing
[ANNOTATION]	Modern secondary schools are more complicated than schools used to be.	Entailment
B	yeah
A	teachers come and go head head teachers come and go
B	people can't cope with it
A	it no no ad there's so much bureaucracy and paper work and and Ofsted and what's needed
B	ah it's crazy
A	yeah
B	I don't know how any of these teachers do it
A	no
B	I really don't I really don't
A	no
B	cor that's crunchy across there that's your fallopian tubes
A	yeah is it
[ANNOTATION]	It is easy being a teacher nowadays.	Contradiction
B	yeah
A	oh
B	you've still got your shell
A	yeah yeah yeah just falling off inside it's all just going horribly wrong
[ANNOTATION]	Their fallopian tubes are fine.	Contradiction
B	it's like you can just imagine like bits failing off a clock or something can't you?
A	yeah yeah
B	all the mechanisms
A	yeah yeah the springs all going dong dong
B	yeah springs like going ding
[ANNOTATION]	Bits falling off a clock would make noise.	Entailment
B	yeah it starts turns round and then and then the hand's falling off it's like that's a bit how I feel at the moment
A	yeah that's about right
B	has it?
A	yeah they've put some picture on
B	well I well I see you put a picture of that that really nice one of you on the the
A	ah yeah
B	yeah and I thought ah I wonder if that's cos you're getting ready to go skiing
A	no that was because it was Monday and I was really fed up
B	were you?
A	and
B	yeah
A	and having my op if I'd had it Monday I might have been able to do a bit of gentle skiing when I went Christmas New Year time
B	so you don't reckon you'll be able to ski now?
A	well now it's three weeks later which means you know I I I'll be six weeks after the op and I'll be flying out a few days before Christmas to go and they right it's six weeks well you you're recovery
B	yeah
A	so and then actually full
B	mm mm
A	so I don't know but if I can't I you know I mean we're out there
B	you're still going
A	oh yeah yeah
B	yeah
A	going out with the kids
B	yeah yeah yeah cos you're going for Christmas aren't you?
A	mm Christmas and New Year yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	cos obviously I suppose
A	yeah yeah that's it and and I'm out end of January we're going for a week then to one of our friends has got a real nice chalet
B	yeah
A	and we're going there for for
B	did you learn to ski when you met
A	it was after that
B	after that
A	he couldn't ski
B	couldn't he?
A	no no we we went probably when we were about forty-one or something?
B	did you?
A	yeah
B	learnt taught yourself to ski or did you have skiing lessons?
A	we had a few lessons at
B	really?
A	yeah but we're lucky because we go we we can go so much a year each year
B	yeah
A	we go out for weeks you know a few weeks at a time sort of thing erm we've got so it's like we've been skiing for years and years and years and years
B	yeah
A	cos we just get you know do so much so
B	great
A	yeah
B	it's good though isn't it? these sort of like oh let's learn to ski
A	well people kept saying to us cos of the water skiing oh you ought to do it you ought to do it
B	yeah cos you did that didn't you?
A	mm and
B	yeah
A	I'm not you know I'll potter round on a couple of skis behind the boat water skiing but for me it's more sitting next to the lake in the sun you know
B	yeah
A	and I'm I'm not that into the the the you know big water ski side of it
B	yeah
A	so when
[ANNOTATION]	speaker B likes waterskiing	Neutral
B	so when you when they he said to you about going then did you sort of think mm well?
A	well some
B	yeah
A	so yeah we went and had a had some lessons at
B	never
A	they've got the dry ski slope
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	speaker A does not like waterskiing	Entailment
A	and then next to it you've got a little tiny basic
B	I bet you thought this isn't gonna work this isn't gonna work
A	no no and then he got us onto the slope and we were sort of going and the dry ski slope you go it's so slow you're almost like stopped on it really and you get yourself going and going and on it and in the end I had some private lessons cos
B	was he?
A	and I I'd go I don't like this ah so I had a few private lessons with this this guy he was going backwards in front of me going down and saying like just look into my eyes you know and
B	concentrate
A	and he was quite good he was quite good-looking so it was quite nice
B	yeah
A	he was a nice guy so I was like okay okay yeah so so we were doing that and it's I'm okay went out for this long weekend went to Andorra we started off and thought right we'll have a lesson to start because you put your kids on on the snow the first time and you you're feet just they move differently it's like really skiddy it's like oh
[ANNOTATION]	it snows a lot in Andorra	Neutral
B	where's it's different from the dry skis
A	yeah
B	like completely
A	yeah yeah it's it's like imagine going and sliding a long with with your shoes on sliding across a carpet or sliding on a wood floor if you went and slid it's that different so if you've got your socks on a carpet and your yeah or your socks on a wood floor it's just that little bit of
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	yeah so we we all had a lesson and we on this we all
B	that's what I wouldn't like
A	no and they've been
B	do you like them now?
A	oh yeah no I was never bothered with heights erm
[ANNOTATION]	dry skiing is different from the real ski	Entailment
B	yeah
A	I just love looking round at all the scenery so
B	yeah yeah
A	so it was fine erm
B	oh okay so you can keep going as far as you want to go
A	yeah yeah with this one most of them they're not most of them you go start to finish but this particular one you could go up so far so then you could just get off or you carry on
B	right
A	so he said oh by the end of the week you might manage that so five minutes after he'd gone
A	honestly yeah I'm fine off you go so they disappeared off
A	and apparently they'd gone up there
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	the lesson was short	Entailment
A	well she just fell and she was laid on the floor her old man went to get her and got hold of her under the ankle er ankles armpits pulled her round so her skis were going the right way and then he sort of
A	yeah going ah she was and then she actually
B	sounds like something out a comedy
A	yeah then
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	the incident was funny	Entailment
A	oh I didn't see all this no no I was doing my little round in circles and then I stopped to have a drink so she then took off her other ski never f-ing skiing again in my f-ing life and that's it de de de
B	and did she?
A	no no she then climbed down and she never skied again that was it
B	did she ever?
A	no no no
B	never went with you again you two
A	no totally that was it
B	put her off
A	yeah so she came and sat in the café bit with me
B	yeah yeah
A	like she was just like that's fine I'm quite happy I'm going to sit here with my book and my hot chocolate I was like right
A	so then I said right and then
B	yeah
A	so we go to the chairlift and I say how do you get on the chairlift then? he's like well you just sit as it comes and so yeah it it came and we sat and then we put the bar down yeah that was fine and you're going up and I was thinking oh I said well how do you get off? he said well you just sort of stand up as as you get to this bump you your skis touch the snow and then you stand up and you go and then the chairlift carries on
B	so you go up with your skis on do you? yeah?
A	yeah yeah so you have your skis on
B	how do you get on with your skis on on the
A	cos it's
B	suppose it's coming behind you and then you literally pop your bum on
A	yeah that's it cos it's it's either snow or the the bit you stand on it's like a matting bit so you don't you stop sliding and you stand and yeah it comes round and then it just
B	mm
A	so then when you get to the other end the idea is you you lift it up and then there's a bump so as you get there you you're sitting and your skis hit the
B	yeah yeah
A	and then you stand up and go down this little bump here and go off to ski
B	you make it sound so easy
A	yeah so did he
A	no
B	no?
A	it I I said to him how do you do it how? and he's like you just stand up you just stand and I'm sort of no explain explain
A	and he said well you and I thought right totally forget about it enjoy the view and I was just looking round ah it was absolutely stunning scenery
B	ah
A	so ah this is beautiful this is
B	you missed it
A	well he stood and then I so I just after I started to stand but obviously the chair was going so I didn't actually stand and it just took me and he stood and I carried on
B	and you went on
A	yeah and I leant over backwards going I didn't make it and he just said he just
B	oh no so he's thinking you've got to go round again
A	well I had to go right to the top which was the bit we weren't meant to be going on cos it was harder so
B	right you have to get do you have to get off there or can you just come round again?
A	oh yeah no no you can't get off
B	you got to get off?
A	yeah yeah yeah you have to get off so matey behind was at the where you get off was going put the bar down put the so I thought okay put the bar down I thought okay just enjoy the scenery so I I did you know and
B	so was he going to come up and follow you?
A	that's what he said yeah so I was there looking mm de de look at all the you know
B	just standing there and he's thinking why she's
A	yeah looking at all the scenery yeah and then
B	did you get off alright though when you got to the top?
A	no
B	I'd by oh my god
A	well I just got as I got towards the top and there was there was a woman there and I was sort of waving to her saying I can't get off I
B	I'm surprised you went back
A	I had to stand at the top then just over there for ten minutes or so until
A	so then he he comes up and it's more or less the end of the day then and we're sort of saying right we're at the top of this mountain you know
B	what do we do now?
A	I know cos when we were thinking oh it's down like a fairly easy run but you are actually up a mountain you have to remember this so we're like right okay so we started going down okay first bit yeah not bad not bad and then all the clouds started to come in cos they do often at the end of the day so it's it's fog you can't see and it's like okay and
B	doing it really slowly
A	yeah and then occasionally thinking no like going down on my bum
B	were people going
A	there were people coming yeah and and we and I was going down on my bum a bit down on my bum a bit and then it'd clear a bit I'd be like right a bit right a bit and then this skidoo things come down with the person from the lift they'd gone up to get her and she'd gone down and we suddenly thought we know now normally
B	yeah
A	and and they just went down and left us and it was just like so we were coming down this thing didn't know where we were going you know
B	where have they gone?
B	and he didn't
A	yeah ad he didn't and
B	yeah she was alright
A	so she was okay he ended up with real bad blisters
B	ah
A	and he was up all night being ill cos he was drinking the water which he shouldn't have done so he was sat on the loo
B	what a nightmare
A	oh it was funny and
B	never going skiing again
A	exactly exactly
B	yeah never skiing again
A	yeah yeah
B	what a holiday was that for a week?
A	no it was a long weekend Friday Monday yeah yeah
B	oh thank god for that and you still went back
A	well after that cos we enjoyed it we then went for a week with the kids and we took them back to Andorra and we said right you know let's get into this we got them some lessons
B	did they ski? not no have ski
A	no no they had some lessons before again at at the dry ski slope and then erm yeah and then we went out there we all had a lesson again and I was just still like I was just so scared about it all so in the end I had I had a lesson on my own with somebody out there while they went off and started doing what they were doing and we went up and he took me up on this chairlift and I was crying in the chairlift and he said do people normally cry in the chairlift with you? he said it is not normal no
B	yeah
A	what are you scared of? I said I don't know I'm just so scared I said I look down the mountain and I'm just so scared he said okay we don't look down the mountain I was like I've got to go down it but what he did he actually took me straight onto a red run cos you have green red no green blue red and then black
B	so red is second from the top?
A	yeah and he he took me down I'm going I can't do a red run he said we're not going down it and I'm still at the top of this run with him thinking I've got this nutter
B	are they steeper the red runs?
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	like the steeper you get
A	they get so the green's really easy beginner blue is harder erm then red and then black's the really hard and you get double diamond and off-piste and stuff
B	ah off-piste
A	but but
B	was he getting into reds then
A	he'd want to do them but I wouldn't go with him a so he'd sometimes go with if we met up with people he'd go with them but I was like no no I'm quite happy doing my blues and then one night somebody said in the bar well they're not they're not reds I said what? he said they're not red they're dark blues he said just think of that he said you get a
B	okay
A	and we did
B	and you did
A	yeah and it was fine and it was easier that so so many bits of the blues that I'd done
B	and never looked back isn't it funny? so erm so you don't actually just go in a straight you do go in a straight line don't you?
A	you you go
B	but you go
A	yeah side to side you sort of yeah like that
B	ah
A	or you can go more straight down and then you do this to slow yourself down or
B	so do you think after that it's just practice?
A	yeah it is and it's getting the technique right as well because we we sort of carried on from then and just did a lot of skiing and got better but actually we should have had more lessons earlier on
B	right
A	because we got a lot of bad habits and bad ways whereas
B	blacks now as well
A	oh yeah we do off-piste we go
B	really?
A	yeah yeah I mean off the side we're going along where you come to a mountain you can go along the top here and then actually ski down sort of next to the piste as such so yeah we do that sort of stuff and
B	so that as you say comes from just you so how many years have you skied now?
A	erm well probably about eight
B	really? it's a long time now
A	yeah
B	and you just went every year did you?
A	yeah and and go a few times every year
B	yeah yeah wow so it just shows you can at any age doesn't it?
A	yeah oh definitely
B	did you ever hurt yourself?
A	erm oh I detached ligaments from this collar bone here erm I did that I've concussed myself a few times even with a helmet and
B	really? what just hit something like
A	like no just hitting it on the floor just even not going too fast just going back and actually I did a like a bedump like two hit thing when I went back which just
B	wow
A	but it's the same as any sport you can hurt yourself
B	yeah yeah
A	you know erm as I say well touch wood I've not
B	done anything any too serious and
A	no no no he's er
B	so are the kids good now as well?
B	mm mm
A	he went about five years ago I think with a friend they went snowboarding with the friend's family over in Germany erm cos his dad had been in the forces and he knew somewhere there to go and they went and you know he he was snowboarding and had a good time so he said he's probably forgotten how to do it
B	yeah
A	but he he just got on it and did when he was skiing and snowboarding so not necessarily the best technique I mean he might find it's a bit different this time cos he's a lot bigger now erm and he was always tall but he was tall and gangly more than anything whereas now
B	he's filled out a built more
A	yeah he's seventeen no sixteen stone now so he's he's big
B	mm mm
A	so he might find it's not quite as easy just to stand on it and head down
B	god he used to be tiny skinny didn't he?
A	yeah yeah he did yeah he did
B	god
A	he's just he's totally filled out I mean cos he's a the gym as well and he's doing you know he's
B	working out and stuff
A	taking supplement stuff and eating lots of chicken and rice
B	goodness protein protein protein
A	yeah that's what he's doing so
B	wow times change don't they?
A	mm
B	I'd love it if I had a hobby I don't have anything I don't have a hobby should do
A	don't you?
B	no wish I did just I'm not very sporty unfortunately
A	no
B	I wish I was but
A	yeah well each to their own I I wouldn't class myself as sporty I've just found something I love with the skiing so
B	yes that's good isn't it?
A	you you just feel free
B	it's not cheap either is it to go skiing?
A	no no
B	you know you've got to have all the gear haven't you? and obviously that costs and
A	yes this is it and your lift pass as well that's that costs
B	yeah and all you're what are they called sallapecs?
A	salopettes
B	salopettes
A	yeah and ski pants and
B	yeah they all cost don't they?
A	yeah that's right no it's it's not a cheap hobby
B	so if you did decide that you didn't like it when you got out there you'd be like oh what am I going to do with this lot then?
A	yeah yeah so
B	mm
A	so you say you could do with a hobby? are you creative? do you like knitting or do you do anything like that or?
B	well I haven't even tried knitting for a long time really
A	mm
B	as I say I'd love to get into doing something I just dunno what
A	mm I don't know quite a few people I know go to craft clubs now
B	yeah that seems to be quite popular
A	and do that sort of quilting and crafting and and that sort of stuff
B	yeah my friend she's got into quilting and and em sewing and all that
A	mm
B	she loved the Great British Sewing Bee and all that you know when that came out
A	yeah mm mm it's just finding it's like with
B	now she's well away isn't she with it
A	yeah it's just finding something something cos you're thinking time-wise you'd probably say like once a week you could go and do something but it could be something you could do in between at home so
B	I need to I need to do something for myself like a vent out that's the trouble but then you know what you end up doing is end up working
A	mm
B	cos it's just too easy sometimes for someone to say oh can I come in yeah okay then
A	yeah yeah
B	and obviously the money's nice isn't it?
A	well yeah yeah that's right
B	but sometimes you just need bit of a vent out don't you? on your own away from work and kids
A	yeah definitely yeah definitely
B	I love this massage bit this bit I love the heal massage
A	mm
B	oh was that Likisma ones?
A	no it's Forever Living products
B	oh I I I've erm I'm just I've just done a clean nine Forever Living thingy
A	yeah yeah
B	cos they must be all different now are they?
A	yeah well I would imagine so
B	from what they used to be
A	yeah cos they do all aloe vera and stuff and
B	yeah that's right I I'm ah
A	mm yeah
B	that's the one thing I had to put orange juice with that couldn't cope with it
A	yeah is that like gunk
B	oh it's rancid
A	yeah
B	yeah gunk
A	oh no
B	aloe vera juice isn't it?
A	yeah yeah no it's horrible but
B	ah yeah
A	yeah I used to do aromatherapy so I went out used to go out and sell products but I used to do aromatherapy with it the ones that they did as well
B	did you
A	I used to do erm take
B	mm
A	and then I'd sort of massage the host
B	yeah
A	and then everybody else paired up and they used to massage each other's and so the host got both feet done
B	that's nice then
A	yeah that's it and I was
B	did you do well out of it?
A	erm oh yeah yeah
B	mm cos erm years ago aromatherapy used to be really popular
A	yeah
B	it's kind of died a death hasn't it?
A	yeah that's right yeah
B	do you find?
A	yeah it has yeah
B	when did you come out of it?
A	oh years ago this was when the kids were little
B	mm mm
A	and I used to do various things party plan I use I used to
B	as a side line
A	what I used I used yeah I used to do them as erm I used to
B	yeah
A	and then al the same people would have parties and I'd be getting new ones along the way
B	really?
A	that would obviously cover some of the ones that drop off and
B	yeah
A	yeah and then yeah so I did that I did I did Ann Summers I did erm I did my own range of stuff I got my own stuff and did all that
B	mm
A	I did erm I can't remember what else I did can't remember but yeah
B	so that used to be quite
A	yeah just did different thing
B	so that used to be quite a
A	yeah yeah they've they've started doing sort of the pampered chef things now haven't they? and Jamie Oliver parties and stuff
B	yeah they're quite good
A	yeah
B	I've never had one of those before but I wouldn't mind to
A	no I I've been invited to a couple but I've just I've not gone to them but
B	yeah
A	no but I mean the parties used to be all the time you know you used to do used to do really well with them
B	that Forever Living must have been going for years then mustn't it?
A	yeah yeah
B	it really must
A	mm cos they had all em all the cleaning products that were all environmentally
B	ah I see that in the back of the brochure that the I didn't realise they did cleaning because when I went to erm one of my friends parties they erm were just talking really about the clean nine they do a skincare range now and everything
A	yeah mm
B	but like they're trying to get me to sort of like do more and more and I'm like to be honest you know I've got my own skincare range I don't need anything else
A	oh yeah no no that's it
B	the body wrap looks good I actually had the body wrap last week
A	yeah
B	and I actually did lose quite a few inches off my tummy and legs
A	yeah
B	so that's something that I'll probably cos you have to leave that on for an hour so you could do a facial
A	yeah
B	while that's on
A	oh yeah well if you want a guinea pig next week just
B	yeah I'll have to think
A	yeah
B	and then you just clean wrap them up and then lay them on the bed
A	yeah
B	that's it
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	so it's er looks quite a good erm product
A	I know one of my friends does does something that I don't know
B	oh
A	yeah she came she came and did mine and you you really could see
B	yeah
A	she said I lost the most in inches which she said for some of the people who are bigger you'd have thought they'd lose more but she said because my waist was there quite was there quite defined it really just sucked that in
B	sucked it in
A	and up here and yeah and she did sort of like the thighs and then all up just round here
B	how long did the results last for?
A	erm I can't remember actually I mean it wasn't it's just one of these things that gradually comes back doesn't it? so
B	yeah you don't really see it do you?
A	so no no but for the for the night it was brilliant and then for a few days afterwards my jeans I could tell were definitely looser and
B	mm
A	yeah going like that but I can't remember she still does it you know if I wanted it does she'd do it
B	yeah yeah
A	I'd need one on a regular basis at the minute with this
B	it's bloated isn't it?
A	it is yeah it is
B	it's probably
A	yeah yeah
B	with all this
A	well this is why I went to the doctor in the first place cos my stomach was just getting bigger and bigger and bigger and I got this pain
B	mm
A	and my stomach was getting bigger and bigger and I got this pain and it just carried on and on and on and that's when I went and that's when I started doing all these different tests and scans and things and
B	then found
A	that's when they said
B	what they found
A	yeah they said it was it's the fibroids er but even the gyny nurse er consultant has said it doesn't normally give the pain that you've got but she said I think it's just pressing on something
B	mm
A	but she did say just to cover herself that it could end up being something else but she's you know she was happy that there's enough going on in there that could be giving me this problem and therefore you know so
B	right
A	I just hope this'll get taken out and it'll sort itself out cos they checked like the scan and checked and said all the bowel looked fine and
B	good so nothing's like sort of attaching itself or anything there
A	no no so they said all that looked fine and
B	that's good then
A	yeah
B	so you just never do you?
A	no this is it
B	yeah you can sort of I think like that's just round all your erm lady bits round there
A	yeah
B	cos I thought oh
A	yeah
B	yeah it was a bit crunchy but in there earlier but it feels like it's it's dispersed now
A	mm
B	so that's good
A	yeah this is nice
B	yeah a little bit in your adrenals there and your kidney area
A	yeah
B	yeah that could be like excess water you drinking enough?
A	oh yeah
B	yeah
A	feels like it just feels like everything's not quite right at the moment everything's just that's one of the things I've reasons I thought this would be good to have this cos it's
B	good detoxifier
A	yeah
B	really good detoxifier
A	mm
B	yeah you're a little bit more swollen today I think than last time
A	yeah yeah
B	right so just close your eyes for me do some visualisation
A	cheers that was nice I do love water
B	it's nice isn't it?
A	I think it's one of my favourite drinks
B	it just feels clean to me does it to you?
A	yeah it's so refreshing
B	yeah it just always hits the spot doesn't it?
A	mm
B	so right
A	oh okay that's good
B	no solar plexus so did you erm drink loads of water last time?
A	yeah
B	and just had a rest feel the benefits
A	yeah yeah I did
B	excellent so I picked up your ears again in this one
A	yeah
B	and
A	I've got the hoppy ears counters at home
B	they're good aren't they?
A	yeah I know so we used to come and obviously it's lovely when you do it cos you get all the
B	massage yeah
A	and that but yeah we just
B	good for a bit of maintenance though isn't it really as well?
A	it is yeah that's what we do we usually do
B	keep on top of them
A	yeah spring and autumn so
B	yeah no if I a lot of people find that they just fend off colds
A	mm oh yeah yeah
B	they're really good for that just keeps you on top of it
A	I used to get lots of sinus problems and it they really helped with that
B	good
A	and now if I ever feel I've got a bit of a cold coming I take Echinacea
B	yeah and that works
A	take that religiously yeah
B	great
A	so every winter I might get one could cos one 'll come out of the blue and I'm not I haven't had any symptoms its coming
B	yeah
A	and I get a could but apart from that I don't tend to get any
B	there's a lot to be said I think isn't there for it?
A	oh yeah I say to so many people at work when they start sniffling I say right take these this is what you know and I give them the sheet say take these
B	which one do you wear wear use now?
A	just the Boots Echinacea
B	right
A	yeah just the Boots one
B	must do that again
A	yeah I find it work really really well just
B	I think with kids you they pick up so much
A	oh yeah this is it just as soon as you get any slight thing like in your nose or you know the first bit first time you feel and I think oh and I just take Echinacea for the next couple of days
B	you get that stickiness don't you at the back of your throat?
A	yeah yeah just take it for a couple of days and that's it then
B	mm
A	so many people at work take it now cos I've said and they've seen I just don't get the colds
B	yeah
A	and they're sort of oh yeah you know and they get stick in another cold and I just say just try it and they do
B	well I mean you got your self through it even really it just makes you feel rubbish doesn't it?
A	mm oh that's right
B	as well
