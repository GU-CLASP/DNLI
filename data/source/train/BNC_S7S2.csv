B	quite a few years ago
A	we can talk normal
B	I know yeah quite a few years ago erm there was a girl called
A	mm
B	not here obviously erm she lived in I can't remember the name of her village and erm she was
A	yeah
B	and erm on Christmas Eve it's really sad but her dad passed away
A	mm
B	heart attack died
A	yeah
B	erm her and her mum found him in an armchair like dead Christmas Eve
A	yeah
B	like really awful bless her erm but
A	yeah
B	and the house they rented my mum used to do the cleaning for
A	right okay
B	the blanket that they wrapped him up in my mum took to clean and it was in the erm laundry room outside
A	mm
B	for quite a while now I didn't I didn't know I didn't care whatever but that laundry room is exactly underneath my blue room
A	yeah
B	my blue room is where I think all the stuff is coming from it's where I hear the stuff it's where the footsteps stop all of that kind of stuff
A	yeah
B	so it might just be coincidence it might be my mind putting meaning to something that there doesn't need to be meaning to or anything
A	yeah
B	basically all the stuff like me being scared of the room and all that it started as soon as my mum had that blanket like before I even knew about it
A	really?
B	yeah it's like it really really freaked me out because it was like someone did die in that
A	yeah
B	and got wrapped up in it so I don't know it's weird it might be coincidence but it really freaked me out and me and
A	yeah where did he stay when he moved here?
B	in the the little blue room that you stayed in the beginning
A	oh right yeah
B	he slept in there erm like we did a test like I told him about it and he is the same like he doesn't really believe like he would never ever pay attention when I would tell him and I'd be scared and stuff and try and get reassurances and he just didn't really care at all
A	yeah
B	he'd tell me I was stupid so he was like right we'll go do a test
A	mm
B	it's like a little circle lid put it on the paper drew a circle around it then we'd know if something happened if it was to be moved or anything we'd see that it would moved from around the circle we forgot about it and a few days later we went back and we we couldn't find the lid and there was the paper with the circle
A	yeah
B	but when I really got it out of him of him I was like was that you? you have to tell me I was getting really really scared and he swears that it wasn't him
A	yeah
B	but I don't know might have been him trying to freak me out
A	I don't think he'd do that to you
B	but still
A	personally I don't think
A	yeah
B	it's like when me and
A	yeah
B	I just don't like it
A	maybe someone's died in there before
B	well I don't know because this was a family home and like the amount of generations that people have lived and died here but I don't
A	cos
B	mm mm there was loads of stuff in it it my dad just demolished walls and put them up in different places
A	right okay
B	so it didn't look anything like it does now
A	right
B	but erm just
A	right
B	and she said that
A	mm
B	when I'd apparently like talk to people like see people or feel them and stuff
A	yeah
B	but she said that there used to be people there all the time like she'd feel them and I don't remember exactly having spoken to her about it like since but there was something apparently that like a white lady used to live in
A	mm
B	called her the white lady because she always used to be dressed in white and stuff
A	mm
B	like she wasn't evil
A	mm
B	it wasn't anything nasty my mum would just sense her sometimes and she used to do spiritual
A	mm
B	like all about spirits and like healing and all that kind of stuff
A	yeah
B	as the name implies
B	and erm I had a friend in the village can't remember her name I know it was
A	mm
B	but it's happened before where I've seen something like not particularly someone but something
A	mm
B	in my bedroom when I was really young but I used to have these really really horrible nightmares about it wasn't a person it was like black smoke in chains
A	mm
B	and it would always come into my bedroom and I'd hear the chains outside my bedroom and all that kind of stuff and I never brought up my mum cos I was always too scared
A	mm
B	but I just used to put it down to being like bad dreams but there's been some points like in my bedroom
A	yeah
B	it just used to freak me out
A	I can remember once when we were kids I'd say more teenagers about like
B	mm
A	and then there's a fence and a pub and just like some empty ground sort of a field and erm at the bottom of the field there's an old fence that you have to jump over to get on to this field cos it's meant to be the primary school's field like they own it and erm we were just sat at the top of the field and we were all just sat chilling out I sat with my boyfriend and everyone else was just sat with whoever and we were all just sat chatting and we saw these white light like it was shaped like a human like a not a woman or a man just like a human it was not like really big like five foot nine or something like that in height and it sped from one side of the field to the other and it
B	yeah
A	but we saw that three or four times in the whole time that we went there like we saw this this thing just shoot from one field to the next like a shooting star just like there's one second gone the next like so fast like it weren't a human it weren't a torch cos if it were a torch
B	yeah
A	spinning round the corner and that's why it went so fast but there were no road
B	yeah
A	like and we were all freaked out we all legged it like to the bottom of the field and like fucking freaked out
B	that's really weird
A	but yeah that thing with my mum all eh her and her friends did a Ouija board and erm they all like left the game so like they all got freaked out and just stopped playing they didn't like ask permission to leave from the spirits or anything like that and whether it's a coincidence or not a few days later one of her friends a black girl erm that she were friends with erm died she were crossing the road and a car were coming one way
B	yeah
A	and a car going that way and she got hit by both like she got sandwiched between them both and got chucked up in the air and she were dead like instantly and then a few days after or a few weeks another girl died
B	it's awful
A	but my mum I can remember being saying I'm going to a sleepover is it okay? blah blah blah and she was just like oh what are you going to do? like I told her she freaked the fuck out like my mum doesn't freak out about anything smoking drugs sex anything
B	yeah but that thing that I just told you about the black cloud I knew it was a woman but the black cloud and the chains
A	mm
B	I literally I don't think I've even thought about that since it's happened
A	that would freak me the fuck out
B	it's just a thought that's just come to me I've never brought it up with my mum like I've literally I feel like I've not you know when something happens and sometimes you replay memories
A	yeah
B	and think about it I don't genuinely think I've ever thought about that since I was a child until now
A	yeah
B	like it's just sort of hit me so it just reminds me that tomorrow I'll talk to my dad or I'll erm talk to my mum about it and just see if it fits anything she ever felt or
A	but maybe that
B	maybe it just it it just feels like something that's too graphic and too grown up like too metaphorical for someone of that age
A	yeah
B	cos when I lived in that house in
A	mm
B	like that just seems like something that I wouldn't really be aware about
A	yeah
B	well they're saying that apparently
A	your dreams wouldn't be that complex
B	yeah that's what I mean but saying that I used to come out with some right things my mum said apparently some really weird things and she'd be like I'm sorry what?
A	is this all dark chocolate by the way?
B	erm that's not but it's got pistachio in it
A	oh they're not
B	yep
A	go on what were you going to say?
B	no that's it so I don't know
A	my dad loves this chocolate
B	really? pistachio?
A	no this this type of chocolate what is it?
B	oh Lindt
A	Lindt yeah
B	nice?
A	yeah real nice actually
B	mm might try some
A	yeah I really like that
B	I've always been a bit off about pistachio because
A	it's really rich but it's nice it's a weird flavour
B	yeah
B	oh yeah like
A	with gold
B	I know what you're talking about though they used to come in erm Heroes packets
A	they'd come like this
A	yeah well we used to get
A	like
B	cheeky
A	like he loves sort of weird stuff like that but he doesn't like Sunday dinners
B	what?
A	he's so weird like when my mum and dad lived together he would literally just eat sandwiches and pizza that were his diet like ham sandwiches and pizza that was all he wanted to eat
B	how is he still alive? and like
A	and you see he used he used to drink two litres of coke a day as well no not two cos they come in two litre bottles don't they? like two bottles of two litre cokes
B	shit oh that's awful
A	like he's basically rotted his whole stomach away
B	god when I drink too much coke I feel physically sick like I feel it on my teeth
A	he used to drink it all day every day he used to smoke a lot of weed though like all day every day so he were always thirsty so
B	that's not helping
A	whenever he weren't at work he used to smoke weed so
B	wow
A	mm then he didn't used to smoke just used to smoke just weed on his own like his mates would come round they'd have a few joints they'd play on computer games and they'd all have a laugh and stuff he weren't just there smoking a joint on his own like doing it
B	yeah so I was like for teenagers
B	smoke a few joints with your friends and then play computer games
A	no but he were he was massive kid even now like do you know that iron man doll I got him?
B	yeah
A	fucking loved it
B	really?
A	did you not see the photo posted on my wall? I must show you pretty funny so he had this
A	and I were gutted cos they were like oh no he's only got one leg and then he sent me he posted a photo on my wall a few weeks ago I'll tell you what I'll go on his wall cos it'll be quicker to find
B	shit that's not even half bad what he made
A	no like
B	wow
A	that's the one I bought him it's so shit
B	how the fuck do you make something like that?
A	but look how good that one is and look how shit the one is that I bought him
B	yeah but your is the right colours
B	I only watched the first one
A	ah
B	mm
A	and he's like oh there you go look I do like it and it's on my next to my other
A	how you could ever get laid seriously
A	yeah
B	do you want to play a game of pool?
A	yeah let's let's finish this and then I'll go and get the next
A	finish this glass and then we'll go and get the next bottle and then we'll play pool cos I think he's going to be in bed soon
B	yeah well on the balcony when I said I'm going to
B	but
A	oh he's going to be there a while then
B	so yeah
A	we're staying up late tonight drinking aren't we right?
B	yeah
A	oh good
B	obviously
A	cos it is my last night
B	yeah
A	and I'm going to bribe you with that
B	you don't have to bribe me ah I made myself bleed again
B	no no
A	I'm like just stop scratching yourself you weirdo
B	but the eczema's kind of gone
A	don't rub it cos it'll make it itch again don't touch it forget that it is there
A	it's cos your scratching that's no it's cos scratching that's all it is
B	yeah but seriously
A	it
B	it's just like a double whammy of awfulness it's like the mosquito bite already itches put eczema on top of it it's like
B	it's awful
A	tell him he can go to bed and put the light on it's okay
A	what did he say?
B	don't poke that
A	have you got knickers on?
B	yeah
A	oh you can't see them from this angle
B	really?
A	yeah it looks like you're not wearing any knickers
B	I live on the dangerous side of life
A	when
B	no
A	I don't unless I'm in public so like if I'm at home with
B	no no what I mean is that underneath pyjamas it's like when I was younger
A	that is weird
B	it's like it's like why aren't you wearing knickers and she was like oh it's it was quite a logical explanation she was like it's to let your vagina breath whatever like during like
B	blah blah blah I was like yeah fair enough but it's still weird I was like who doesn't wear knickers underneath other clothing
A	yeah the only time I don't wear knickers under my jamas is if I'm at home and I've just got out of the shower
B	mm
A	like normally I will wear knickers and I'll take the jama shorts off not the knickers cos I like sleeping in my underwear
B	mm
A	like
B	I always wear knickers underneath everything my pyjamas
A	feels weird wearing them like not wearing them right?
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A doesn't always wear underwear at home.	Entailment
B	it does it just feel like you're naked
A	yeah
B	if there's not something there tightly snugging our like lumpy bits and stuff I'm like I feel naked exposed
A	yeah I agree
[ANNOTATION]	Underwear is not always good for vagina.	Neutral
B	I just I just found it so weird I was genuinely just like what are you doing? it's like put those back on please
A	like taking your bra off okay but your knickers?
B	yeah it's like it's just just wanted to get your opinion on that I'm glad I'm glad you agree with me
A	yeah the only time I don't wear knickers it depends what shorts I'm wearing if I'm wearing tight like them blue dotted ones
B	mm
A	them blue ones I've got here with like dots if if I'm at home on my own and I just got out of the shower I'd wear them with no knickers cos they're so tight fitting they're like knickers but I wouldn't wear them as jamas again I'd put them straight in the wash
B	yeah
A	if that makes sense so it's as though I'd be wearing knickers
B	yeah
A	but I don't like sleeping in them so normally I will put knickers on even if I am on my own and just got out of the shower it's only if I ain't got any clean knickers that I do that really
B	I will always put knickers on whether I'm alone or not always and I always sleep in them as well it's like I know loads of people who like like to sleep naked or whatever when they're alone and even if it's hot but even when I'm hot
A	I hate sleeping naked I hate it
B	I always always wear knickers and like a vest top
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	The speakers don't share the same opinion for knicker wearing.	Contradiction
B	always I'm just not comfortable unless I've got that kind of stuff on it's like even if I'm completely by myself
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B only wears woollen underwear.	Neutral
A	yeah no
B	yeah
A	what if someone's there when you wake up and you're like oh shit I've been naked the whole time like
A	does it turn you on?
A	do you want to lick it? lick my toe
A	my toe has no sock it's all exposed
B	your toes are hairy
A	they're really hairy
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A has lots of hair in his/her toes.	Entailment
B	I know
A	I need to shave them so bad
B	don't
A	I shave my armpits
B	oh congratulations
B	please don't shave your toes because they'll just keep coming back worse and worse
A	so should I just let them be hairy forever?
B	wax them
A	no that fucking kills I'd rather keep shaving them forever
B	it's two of your toes and then it'll be done for three months at a time
A	that is true it doesn't last three months though
B	do it four times a year waxing guaranteed they'll be fine
A	do you reckon anyone else notices that they're hairy or just you
B	just me because you always point out that you have hairy hobbit feet
B	so I always look at them but it's like my my toes are hairy but they're blond so you don't actually see unless it's in direct sunlight in which case the blond reflects
A	yeah yeah
B	like the time that I went up to the basketball courts with when I just got back from England with
A	yeah you were telling me you were on the basketball court
B	and I hadn't shaved my legs at all from the whole that I was in England and about three weeks before that
B	I said to
B	I was like don't look at me I'm hideous
B	it was really awkward but my boyfriend loves me the way I am
B	whether I have hairy legs or not
A	shall we go down and get the wine?
B	yes I think you should go down and get the wine
A	I'm not going on my own you're going to come with me
B	okay
A	I've got a
