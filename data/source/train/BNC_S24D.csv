C	so I just flew across and landed on another island
A	okay
C	after I finally got down although that and although loads of monsters spawned there and I didn't know monsters could harm you then and knowing monsters could be harmless
A	mm

C	oh yeah it's really hard to get destroyed
C	yeah it and if you and it's used for the portal to the nether
A	what's the nether?
C	the nether is a rather hellish place I don't really want to talk
A	okay
A	cos I got lost there for about a week I couldn't find my portal
A	mm
C	and annoyingly on PC there is there's not a limited amount of nether so I could have so I could have gone on and on and on

A	a good way of remembering what a simile is is that it sounds similar to something else
B	similar
A	so her eyes were like diamonds that's a simile
B	oh I've done that before
A	yeah?
B	oh yeah
A	but a metaphor is her eyes were diamonds that's the difference not a lot of difference really
B	her eyes are diamonds
A	but obviously they're not really diamonds are they? it's just a way an expression to for us to realise how beautiful her eyes were
B	yeah
C	when you do like cos if her eyes really were diamonds then she'd be rich
A	hang on but that's what I was just saying it's not an actual factual representation is it?
C	no
