B	well we're the same that's the only clock well we've got a little tiny clock
A	mm
B	in the front front room haven't we?
C	mm
B	but we got this clock here

B	and we still go by that clock
C	mm
B	we never change it from British Summer Time to
A	mm
B	Greenwich
C	no point
B	no there's no point in jumping up there and
C	really
B	climbing up there and changing it so
A	that's right I
B	does it?
C	oh right
B	oh well ours must have made up then
A	ours is okay yeah it they in the

C	oh right
A	and I can never be bothered
C	well the Subaru
B	I know
C	went but it took a long time to do it I don't know why
B	yeah
C	mm
B	all this modern cars
A	perhaps it's set to European time cos they don't change the clocks the same time as we do do they?
B	no they no that's true

A	I can't see that myself
C	that's what I mean how do they do it?
B	no
A	I mean they can do it on a
B	mm
A	and that's why it wouldn't
C	mm
A	you know if they sort of change the day
B	well I suppose yeah
A	when you change the clocks it wouldn't catch up
B	yeah
A	but I mean they used to have watches what would do that didn't they?
B	they did yeah
A	they
B	yeah
A	you know change er you know change with the er
C	yeah

A	yeah
C	yeah
A	yeah
B	god
A	well but she's also very right wing
C	yeah
B	yes she is she is
A	and she
B	oh right
A	and like she is like a
B	multibillionaire
A	yeah she is well not multi
A	multimillion
B	multimillion yeah
C	mm
A	and she is very erudite
B	yes
A	and she was
B	he couldn't cope with it
A	he couldn't cope with it
B	oh wow
A	but she was sort of saying things about
A	you know and you're forcing them out you know and they wouldn't be able to pay it and stuff like that and she was saying oh and some of these areas in London even a garage is worth you know two million quid you know
C	mm
A	you know what I mean?
B	well
A	but I mean
C	yeah
A	all her arguments were like
B	well it
A	really
C	mm
A	superficial
B	well of course they were
A	and ignorant
B	yeah
A	and
B	he didn't point it out to her at all
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	people who you know are pensioners who are living in a house worth two million quid you know they can they don't have to pay that until after they die
B	yeah
A	and they it gets into the probate
B	that's right yeah
A	you know or he didn't say that
B	oh yes that's a yeah I know what
A	er something release equity
B	that's it equity release
C	oh yeah
A	it's in their interest to get equity release
C	yeah
B	that's right
A	and live off that money
B	yeah
C	mm
A	and because when they die forty percent of the profit of the house
B	that's right
A	are going
C	mm
B	going to the insurance company or
A	death duties you know
B	yeah but the rest will go to the people who have
A	yeah I know
B	give
A	but I mean like say you're living in a two million pound house
B	yeah
A	you know
B	yeah yeah
A	so that means one point six million is gonna be charged as on death duties at forty percent
B	yeah
A	so automatically your estate is gonna lose
C	mm
A	forty percent of one point six million
B	yeah
C	it's a lot yeah
A	well it's a lot of money whereas
C	mm
A	you know if you had
B	yeah
A	like on a two million pound house you could have a half million pound equity release
B	yeah
A	that's tax free cash in your pocket
B	that's right
C	right
B	yeah
A	which you could be living off
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	when you die you know this two million pound house less the half a million equity release less a couple of hundred thousand
B	that's it yeah
C	mm
A	is still
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	and you're still but you're paying you know once you take the four hundred thousand off it you're only being taxed on six hundred thousand
B	yeah yeah
C	mm
A	so you know
B	yeah
A	you know you're you're you know what you've been living off basically is what you would have had to give the taxman anyway
B	that's right we had a friend
C	mm
B	well or if
C	yeah that was
B	she er she did that with her house
A	mm
C	yeah
B	because she didn't want to leave it to her son
A	mm
B	cos he was wicked bloke
B	you know
A	yeah that's
B	so she did this
A	mm
C	yeah
B	and she lived in her shed
B	didn't she?
C	mm
B	literally lived in her shed
C	and she and then she's moved into the house
B	and then
C	didn't she?
B	the house again yeah
C	mm
B	but er
A	but why did she live in a shed?
C	so
B	oh cos she's rented that one out
A	oh she rented it out
C	yeah
B	she rented that out and lived in a shed
A	yeah
C	so that was her income
B	so she was getting an income as well
A	mm
C	mm
B	as
A	yeah
B	I mean there's this was several years ago now so the equity release wouldn't have been
A	but
B	yeah
A	and I think she got thirty thousand equity release
B	yeah
A	and with that money she paid off all her debts I mean she had a mortgage of ten thousand
B	yeah
A	so she paid that off
C	yeah
A	and she's
B	yeah
A	you know?
C	oh
A	and so she was living there she wasn't paying the mortgage any more had a nice sunroom and then when she sold it
C	yeah
A	in value
B	the equity release was
A	that the charges that they'd charged cos the they don't you know they just roll up the charges don't they?
B	that's right yeah
C	oh
A	I mean the charges they charged her
C	right
A	you know
C	so it worked out
A	a hundred thousand out of the deal you know
B	yeah yeah
A	you know
C	it worked out really well
A	yeah
C	yeah you you tend to think that it's
A	yeah
C	a bit of a
B	yeah
C	you know
A	yeah
C	you'll lose lots of money out of it
A	well what they do they charge you
B	yeah
A	right? cos basically they got sold the money on it I mean they're getting a good deal out of it right
B	well of course they are yeah
C	mm
A	because
B	isn't it the government that er
A	no no there's different companies who do it
B	oh right yeah
A	and what they do they depending on how old you are
B	yeah
A	and erm
B	yeah
A	cos they've gotta work out that say
B	mm
A	you know say a house like mine would probably be worth about a hundred and sixty thousand
B	yeah
A	right? so they'd give me
C	mm
A	fifty-five thousand quid
B	yeah
A	and they wouldn't charge me any interest
B	no
A	but it'd be charged up combined on the fifty thousand so the next year
B	so it would be
A	you owe them fifty-five thousand or whatever and then the year after that it's fifty-eight thousand
B	I see
A	then the year after that it's sixty thousand and the next year after that it's sixty-five thousand you know and it just keeps going
B	oh right
A	until you die really
B	yeah
A	but I mean they charge something like six and a half percent
B	yeah
A	annually
B	which is dead cheap really innit?
A	which you know
C	mm
A	yeah I mean
B	yeah
A	and then you'd die and then they'd get all your house right?
B	they do yeah yeah
A	because that covered because they allow the
B	yeah of course they are yeah
A	you know they got first choice of the money
B	yeah
A	but on the other hand you know if your house is going up in value every year
B	yeah
A	you know er you know I mean recently
C	mm
B	they've been going up over five percent a year so
B	so I hear yeah yeah
A	yeah
B	and yet
C	mm
B	hasn't sold his yet has he?
A	you know
B	no
A	like a two bedroomed flat
B	that'll cost a bomb wouldn't it?
A	a maisonette
B	yeah
A	when they bought it two years ago
C	yeah
B	and now?
A	the people downstairs
B	double I would think
A	they've got an identical
B	wow
C	oh right
B	we did
C	yeah
B	that was
A	I mean that is a lot of money innit for a two bed
C	yeah
A	I mean these are not big places I mean
C	yeah
A	I should think
B	yeah
A	er wall unit
B	yeah
A	another little bedroom at the front
C	mm
A	and the sort of
B	yeah
A	and it is in a
B	well that's good if they've got a garden
C	yeah yeah
A	it was it is in a really posh area
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	well that's worth a lot of money the garden in London innit?
A	mm
C	mm
A	yeah yeah
B	outside space in London is
A	yeah
B	worth a bomb
C	yeah
B	I mean they had something er that was probably er Homes Under the Hammer again that we watched
C	I think probably we watch that on most days
B	because we do like Homes Under the Hammer
A	mm
B	and er
A	mm
C	mm
B	you know just to go out on the balcony was worth an enormous amount of money compared with a house that was just
A	yeah yeah yeah
C	yeah
B	cos that's what lots of them places are
A	yeah
B	they look like
A	well you see a lot some people
C	mm
A	don't wanna go home do they?
B	no no they don't
A	I mean there's a lot of people who are quite happy to live in a in a block of flats
B	that's right yeah
A	you know with no garden nothing and in fact I was like that for years you know I mean
B	yeah
A	I didn't didn't need a garden didn't want
B	no
A	a garden
B	no
A	just something else to have to look after
B	it is isn't it yeah
A	when you're young and busy
B	well yes
C	yeah
A	but once you have kids
B	yeah
A	you suddenly realise that a garden is very desirable
C	it's everything innit?
A	innit?
B	it is yeah
C	just to be outside without going somewhere
A	and when you've got a kid running around in the house all day
C	yeah
A	can't get out cor
B	before we built this place
C	well
B	we had the we had the field didn't we? we we'd bought the field we used to bring them down there
A	mm
B	you know although we had a lovely garden at
A	yeah
C	but we lived in a flat
B	oh yeah
A	in
B	that just had a
A	yeah
B	balcony didn't it?
A	and erm
B	yeah
C	whether it's raining or not you have to go out somewhere to the shops or
A	well down
C	just did it
A	there isn't any sort of greenery round there is there?
C	well there was
B	it won a prize when when
C	there was a bit of outside space but not not to
A	yeah
B	no
C	only
B	nothing you could
A	well it's nothing that I mean I yeah
B	no no keeping kicking balls and
A	like I had
B	yeah
C	that's where we used to go a lot
A	had any sort of a park
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	I mean I can't think of anything that
B	you can't play out there you can't play with the kids could you?
C	no no it was only
A	I can't think of anywhere else nearby
C	only a bit of walk space
B	no
C	wasn't it?
A	only down to by the river and the bombsite
C	yeah mm
A	have you seen that route recently?
B	no I haven't no I haven't been to
A	well you know where erm
A	is it? I think it is
B	yeah
A	and
B	yeah
A	all the way round it
B	is it?
C	yeah
A	it used to be a cast casting place didn't it?
B	it did yeah
A	a foundry er down there
A	all along yeah it's erm
C	yeah
A	into new housing now
C	is it?
A	but the pub is still there
B	is it?
A	the what was it?
B	a
C	what on the corner is that?
A	on just near the bridge on the corner
B	the
C	yeah
A	that's right it's
C	yeah
A	but that's it's incredible you go there and like a chalet village
B	wow
A	you know and all these modern houses
B	I haven't been down there for years
A	and then all the old
C	mm
B	yeah yeah
A	and all the way through there up as far as er
B	yeah
A	is oh
C	yeah
A	a couple of big factories sort of
B	is there?
A	yeah
B	of course that it used to be all shoe factories around there
A	it did yeah yeah
C	mm
B	loads of
A	yeah there were all sorts of stuff
A	mm
B	er well it was down
A	mm
B	industries
A	cos them big old shoe factories were the big things weren't they?
B	they had
A	mm
B	but er
A	cor
C	you see the housing that they've proposed for
A	oh that was the other thing yeah coming on
C	big one ninety there
A	yeah all these massive great
B	yeah
A	signs up
C	thirty upward over there
A	stop the how many? ninety houses
B	ninety houses
C	yeah and thirty they want
A	yeah yeah
C	in
A	yeah well there's no point
C	and they think now they think that's gonna be a
B	yeah but
A	yeah they're
B	that that ninety's going
A	where's the where are these ninety going then?
B	down right down
C	mm yeah
B	the
A	yeah
B	there's a there's a as if you had come from
A	on the right hand side?
B	as you come and
A	what on that corner there
B	come from
A	where you
C	mm
B	yeah
A	oh it's on that bit
C	all the way
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	all the way up and
A	well no that that it's pointless people who are actually protesting cos they'll be built
B	well
A	I mean it's like people
B	apparently
A	apparently protested about the school being developed and things
B	well that's right yeah
A	they'll be built you've got no chance
B	but apparently er
A	mm
B	and this
A	yeah
B	and er
A	yeah no doubt
B	well of course it is yeah
A	so apart from the people who think that'll spoil their village
B	well
A	you know?
C	well they're er
A	I mean it might bring new blood into the village
B	well they're they're
C	but they reckon the schools can't cope you see the schools can't cope doctors can't cope it's quite big now this village
B	yeah
A	I know but I mean what'll happen is
C	this
A	is that they'll just
C	yeah
A	add another doctor to the surgery and
C	mm
A	Portakabins in with the school I mean
B	well they they were
A	it ain't hard is it?
B	they were then saying that the doctor's surgery should have been
A	mm
B	and they missed out on it they reckon
A	yeah well it's like all these things and I mean they they just
B	but
C	yeah
A	that's right
C	mm
B	I mean we had lots of people
A	mm
B	lots of people for it but lots of people against it but we got permission
A	I bet you the majority of people who
B	yeah that's right yeah
A	you know?
B	yeah
A	it's it's a sort
B	that is yes
A	you know I mean at one time
B	not in my backyard
A	at one time
B	that was weren't it yeah
A	about
C	mm
A	you know webbed
B	yeah
A	webbed feet and inbreeding and
B	yeah that's right
A	you know?
B	yeah
B	it was
A	and when you went around the villages it was obvious there was a lot of inbreeding going on
B	well of course it was
A	you know cos it was like
C	mm
A	you know
C	but didn't that happen all over the place
A	yeah and
B	yes it is
A	because it's one of the few places which is you know sort of
B	yeah it is yeah
A	and the economic output and it's because of all the people that import people they're like who's to say
B	well
A	or whatever
B	well yeah
A	they're all strangers to Norfolk but they're all building up the the economy
B	well this is right I mean they brought in if the Polish left
A	no no they're too lazy to compete
B	I mean
A	you know I mean
C	yeah
A	has gone on in
B	yeah
A	twenty years
B	yeah yeah
A	I mean there are thousands of houses been built in
B	there have
C	mm
B	yeah
A	and er they're gonna build even more and I'm thinking
B	yeah
A	well you know why not if you're gonna build a town build a town you know?
B	yeah
A	and they say about the you know I knew that they used to say about the schools and the surgeries couldn't cope
B	yeah
A	to cope I mean they might have had a few years
B	yeah
A	it's a bit like the dentist you know and things like that
B	that's right
A	they might have had a few years where there's problems but they managed to sort it out in the end
B	well
C	mm
B	have got big problems haven't they with the doctors
A	have they?
B	surgeries yeah haven't they?
C	apparently yeah
B	apparently they
C	mm
B	they can't get
C	yeah
B	can't get any
A	well they're only a problem if you're ill
B	that is true
C	yeah
A	mm well I mean you look at
B	oh god
A	you keep reading about that
C	yeah
B	yeah that's in a story state innit?
A	it is
C	mm
B	yeah
A	but I mean that must have been going like that for years
B	yeah
A	and it's a bit like the
B	well
A	that is
B	ever since
A	been running on
B	yes
A	red emergency
B	yes but ever ever since er they were made a what they call it? a
A	what hospital trust?
B	trust
A	yeah
B	quite a long while ago now weren't it and ever since then everything been going downhill
A	of course they have
B	well of course they are
A	who don't really know what they're talk about it
B	yeah
A	it's all
B	yeah
A	whereas they don't look at the future where it's gonna cost ten times as much in the future
B	yeah
A	because they're pulling the money away and when they built
B	they did
A	from the old one
B	they did
A	cos they said oh you don't need them any more
B	cos we have a big turnover we we
A	yeah
B	stick them in and
A	but you know that since then the population
B	well yeah
A	of the catchment area is going up leaps and bounds all the time
B	it is isn't it yeah
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	and they think of well you know you hear these stories about putting these old folks into a taxi
B	yeah
A	you'll be alright
B	yeah
A	I dunno how true they are but
B	well
A	I expect some of it is true somewhere in Britain and
B	well you got you get get this er this old girl just the other day that was the same thing she got sent home in the middle of the night didn't have a key to get in
A	yeah
B	I mean
A	well
B	we need the bed now off you go
C	mm
A	it's a rum do cos I mean like the
B	well there are our
A	the
B	cos
A	are still in a terrible state
B	yeah
A	and they say that
B	yeah
A	where they had like people waiting for twelve hours in a blooming ambulance cos they
B	yeah
A	couldn't get them in through the doors
B	that's right yeah
A	and all the ambulance were blocked up so if they had any new emergencies they couldn't
B	they couldn't go to it no
A	or just drop them on the floor and go
B	yeah yeah
A	but I mean they said oh they'd sorted that all out but then you read that it's still the same
B	it's still the same yeah yeah
A	but they still
B	oh yeah
A	hundreds of thousands of pounds to keep the blooming
C	mm
A	air ambulance in the air
B	yeah that's right
A	I forget how much a day that costs but
B	that costs thousands don't it? yeah
A	well I I think it's something like
B	well er
A	well no when they had one helicopter that was sixteen thousand a day
B	yeah
A	and now they've got two so it's thirty odd thousand a day
B	that is isn't it yeah
A	they're paying
B	yeah
A	for two helicopters who
C	yeah
A	when you see it they're very
B	that's right yeah
A	they're sort of picking up people who
C	mm
A	seem bad but when they get there I mean my niece had a car accident
B	yeah
A	and they had to call the blooming air ambulance for it
B	wow
A	you know you think and there was nothing wrong with her
B	no
A	she'd just sort of like
B	and I suppose they strapped her all up then
A	shift her all er in the air ambulance
B	and there was nothing wrong with her?
A	nothing wrong with her
C	yeah
B	yeah weird innit I mean and yet you get people like the St John's ambulance doing it for nothing don't you?
A	that's right yeah
B	I mean we I watched a programme the other day about that footballer who collapsed with a heart attack
A	yeah
B	on on the on the pitch
C	that's right
B	and St John's ambulance were there keeping him
A	mm
B	and er and er and they saved his life
A	but at one time
B	yeah
A	you know round round the pitch and you'd for the St John's ambulance
B	yeah
A	and like the the people would chuck money you know coins
B	that's right they didn't they?
A	into the but they'd be holding the blanket
C	yeah
A	and chuck coins into the blanket
C	oh
B	yeah
A	well you never see I dunno
B	you never see it any more
A	perhaps the perhaps the clubs give them money
B	perhaps they do yeah
A	I mean they've got a millions haven't they
C	yeah
A	some of these clubs
B	of course they have yeah
A	round the
B	great big blanket and just
C	mm
B	people used to chuck
C	did they?
B	half crowns and two bob bits you couldn't chuck a pound in it cos that used to float
A	not that you would anyway
A	mostly pennies
B	yeah
B	mostly pennies mostly pennies
A	that's right yeah
B	that big weren't they?
A	mm
A	yeah
B	now you've got tuppences and pennies are all steel now
A	that's right
B	and just covered in copper plate
A	that's right and if you collect them
B	with a magnet
A	a magnet
B	yeah
A	and the other ones are worth more than
B	more than the face value
C	mm
A	more than the face value in copper
A	yeah it's strange that when when I was read these stories of when
B	yeah
A	over to
B	yeah
A	apparently like in Germany
B	yeah that's right
A	with this the five pfennig and the ten pfennig I think was they were all sort of
B	yeah
A	and they collect them and they had so many it was
B	what?
A	it's funny isn't it ay?
C	yeah
A	you'd think they'd be going to dig them out now
B	yeah
A	and sort of like use them you'd think they must have some sort of value
C	mm
B	well yeah
C	mm
B	from from pounds shillings and pence to
A	decimal
B	decimal
A	well the whole what was it pre
B	pre twenty-one twenty-one and
A	pre twenty-one yeah
B	yeah pre twenty-one were were nineteen twenty-one were silver
A	I don't think they were solid silver were they?
B	they were solid silver
A	cos there was some if you were you had to
B	well some nickel silver
A	and then if you went back a bit further they were
B	yeah
A	solid silver
B	well we got
C	mm
B	a pound
A	well I can imagine
B	a pound each for our half-crown coins
A	yeah
B	so that they must have been silver
A	mm
B	because we wouldn't get we wouldn't have got a pound each for them would we?
C	no
B	that's when we bought the land
A	yeah
B	a pound each
C	mm
B	we had eight didn't we?
C	mm
B	and went through all our money
A	yeah
B	and finding all this
C	yeah
A	it's funny old
B	are they?
A	yeah cos on all yeah I
B	I've still got threepenny bits
A	I've still got a load of pennies and ha'pennies and
B	and a silver five P
C	oh
B	silver silver threepenny bit
A	silver threepenny bit
B	yeah
A	but the er
B	yeah they you do yeah
C	oh
A	and used to get like nothing for them you know
B	yeah
A	a fiver or something like that
B	that's it yeah
A	but nowadays
B	well
A	they go for like a hundred quite for
C	right
A	a mixed jumble of old coins
B	coins yeah
C	mm
B	people going through their
A	well that's right trying to find the odd one
C	mm
B	yeah
A	stamps as well
C	mm yeah
A	at one time years ago you'd get nothing for a stamp album
B	that's right well
A	you used but now people
B	now you and I had a load of
C	yeah
B	stamp albums my brother had a fantastic
C	I've still got mine
B	you've still got yours yeah
C	better get that
B	but I remember when we when er when there were pounds shillings and pence
B	because there was only so many cos it was Edward the
A	I dunno whatever
B	oh yeah the
A	there was one particular penny where there was
C	yeah
A	only six made or something like that
B	that's it yeah
C	mm
B	nineteen thirty-seven threepenny bit was made he abdicated didn't he
A	yeah
B	and they started making them and had to stop but that lots of them got er put through and er if you have one of them you're worth thousands
B	then
C	yeah
A	yeah well there was a lot of things that
C	always the dream isn't it?
A	a lot of ifs ain't there?
C	yeah
B	yeah a lot a lot of ifs and buts I mean
C	yeah
B	crikey
C	mm
B	the things we could have done if we'd have did them
A	yeah
B	then if
C	if you'd got
A	and it's like that
B	where we would have been now
A	it's like that woman that Irish woman who won the lottery
B	she spent
A	last week
B	oh oh I don't know about that
A	no not the Scottish one this Irish woman she won last week
A	and she said oh yeah I'm gonna
C	ah
A	er falling down and all the money's been taken away
C	mm
A	from them and stuff like that
B	oh right
C	yeah
A	and she said she she says well it's better to have a youth centre rather than hanging around on the streets you know they've got nowhere to go and she's gonna spend all her
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	won't take long does it?
A	on on er
C	that's the sort of thing I would like to do
B	well I mean
A	yeah
B	er in
C	mm
B	they had
C	if it ever happened
B	they had a youth centre up at the church rooms
A	mm
B	the kids used to
A	mm
C	just standing outside they just stand outside and sit on the pavement
B	or just stand outside
A	yeah but the thing is
C	they didn't have to pay then
A	the thing is a lot of
B	yeah
A	and you know why?
B	because the vicar come in and say goodnight
C	cos they didn't wanna have to pay
A	what?
C	cos they didn't have to pay then
A	yeah but I mean like if
C	oh religious
A	worthy individuals
B	that's right yeah
C	yeah mm
A	who try and organising and they're the big I am and stuff like that
C	mm
B	yeah
A	and the kids just aren't interested
B	no they're not
C	no
A	whereas
B	well they used to have to pray at our
A	yeah well they aren't gonna do that are they?
B	course they're not
A	no
A	and then you know every now and again they get sort of wrecked don't they?
B	they do yeah
C	yeah
A	and so people say oh well you know we're not having this any more you know we're close it down
C	yeah true
A	if they can't pay a proper attention to it and all this sort of stuff
B	yeah well er our youth centre they used to have er kids from
A	mm
B	and the same
A	yeah
B	you know all that
A	mm
B	haven't they? I mean they they do a youth centre up there and that's been really
A	well you see this is it if they're run by if you can get some
B	yeah
A	to run it
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	you know what I mean?
B	yeah
A	er who
C	mm
A	get people who actually live around
B	yeah
A	in the village to run it
B	that's right yeah
A	and but you've got to find people who
C	mm
A	got the incentive to do it
B	and and
C	well the guy
A	because nowadays you know they could you know with this sort of idea that you know you can't get jobs and you need CVs and you need this that and the other
B	yeah
A	I think that would be a bit a bit of an incentive to you know kids to get involved wouldn't it?
B	that would wouldn't it yeah
A	you know it could look good
B	apparently we've got a very good youth organisation in in
A	mm
B	the kids write
A	yeah
B	bits in the
A	mm
B	you know and and talk
A	well of course
B	no
A	you know I mean people always have been wary of young people
B	well yes
A	but in in in in Germany
B	yeah
A	and usually it was sort of a big old house
B	to the
A	there's no adults
C	yeah
A	involved with it
B	no
A	and they're sort of like adults they're young adults
B	yeah
A	and sort of like they've been there as young kids and
C	mm
A	they've sort of grown and slowly sort of
B	yeah
A	and they used to have a bar and stuff like this as well
B	yeah
A	and er cos you know a certain amount of people were over the age of drinking and
B	yeah
A	well they used to cook meals
B	yeah
A	and they used to
C	yeah
A	have bands in there they used to have sort of table tennis stuff and but they had the main place of bar sort of place
B	yeah
A	was just like a big sort of place with
B	yeah
C	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Only adults ordered alcohol in the bar.	Contradiction
A	and you could either play games or watch telly or whatever you like you know or just sit and chat
C	yeah
A	like every time there'd be like
B	yeah
A	to open it
B	that's right yeah
A	and they would sort of like be running it
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Television was available in the bar.	Entailment
A	but you could always get plenty of people to
C	mm
B	well
A	work in them
B	we used to bike from
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B doesn't know how to drive a bicycle.	Contradiction
A	mm
B	club or youth centre because the
A	rubbish
B	pretty rubbish
A	mm
B	and the
A	mm
B	table tennis and all the things that
A	yeah
B	kids do you know and play around and do
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B used the bike to go from the club to another place.	Entailment
B	and then that got spoiled
A	yeah
B	you know when when the when blokes and and the woman who ran it left
A	yeah
B	the church took it over and what do you get? you get oh we must say our prayers thank you for everything you know kids don't want no
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	The church took an initiative.	Entailment
B	and that was just it weren't it?
C	yeah
B	I mean how many teenagers want to know about that?
A	no
A	they don't want anyone
B	no no
C	there's a young guy at the back here though isn't it and he's got er
B	oh he's
C	what he calls the
B	brilliant he is
C	but
B	he's kind of religious
C	he's very young
B	yeah but he's he's great
C	but they built they've built a round house now I expect I've told you about that
A	no
C	they've actually built a round house up at
A	okay where have they built it?
C	so
B	just over just
C	over the back there
B	at the back there
C	they still call it the
A	mm
C	their kind of thing and they have
B	yeah
C	music and
B	they have music and
C	and all sorts they're really
B	they have a really good time
C	sounds brilliant
B	and they built these round
A	mm
B	and
C	yeah
B	we climbed up and went in it
C	it was good
B	and that was really well made and that weren't nailed into the tree
A	mm
B	it was all done with cantilevers and stuff
A	yeah
B	you know
A	yeah and this is why they've got to take it down is it?
B	yeah
C	yeah
C	so so now they've
A	oh yeah
C	got a round house anyway
B	they've got a round houses they've built around
C	yeah
B	er all of there now and and they do ever so well
C	and yeah
B	and they have fantastic parties over there don't they?

B	yeah
A	another thing she did was she had this er
B	oh right
A	and they'd come round and say it jumps she'd put it on and say mm it sounds alright to me perhaps you'd better look at it
A	but she used to get all these
B	yeah
C	oh you made it
[ANNOTATION]	it is surprising	Neutral
B	yeah
A	and she used to have thousands and thousands of LPs then I used to record them on my reel-to-reel you see
B	I see right
A	but they were all
B	no
A	it was all
[ANNOTATION]	she had a large number of LPs	Entailment
B	well we we we got a fantastic
A	cassettes
B	cassettes
A	yeah
B	they hired them out
A	really?
[ANNOTATION]	the still have casettes	Contradiction
B	for something like
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	one would record
A	mm
B	and we recorded them all
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	the recording is special	Neutral
B	we've still got the things here
A	yeah
B	and they're not very good now but I mean
A	no
B	of course tapes actually stretch and you
A	I know yeah and they start
B	and they start going stupid and then they
A	mm
B	copied on tapes
A	but then
B	which is naughty
A	but then there was a where you could go to the library and borrow
B	that's right yeah
A	things and copy them couldn't you?
B	yeah you could yeah
A	you could borrow CDs
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	now they put some kind of er
A	dunno it's hardly worth it is it?
B	no
A	I don't suppose they do it in libraries any more it's too expensive
B	I don't suppose they do yeah yeah
A	and most people download stuff anyway and they say that
B	yeah
A	well you can download any song you like
B	yeah
A	can't you?
B	you can yeah
A	cos it will record anything what's coming over the
B	yeah
A	you know I dunno I should imagine that does it direct so
B	well yeah yeah
A	but I can't be bothered now I got
B	well
A	thousands and thousands of well hundreds and hundreds of songs on the computer I never listen to them
B	well you never listen to them
A	I've got stacks of cassettes
B	yeah
A	I never listen to them
B	that's it just stick on the radio
A	and it comes out with random music
B	yeah
A	and think you'll either like it or you don't
B	yeah there's a a a good show on on erm Radio two er
A	yeah
B	Johnnie Walker does Sounds of the Seventies

B	oh I see yeah
A	and they're all doing like Led Zeppelin Two songs and things like that
B	yeah
A	so I
C	mm
A	turn volume to maximum
A	but I've only listened to it about once or twice
C	mm
A	I mean it's an exceptionally good thing you know and
B	mm yeah
C	oh? yeah
B	like more easy listening than that
B	yeah I know what you mean yeah
A	mm
B	I think it's one of the first five LPs I ever bought was Led Zeppelin Two
A	yeah
A	and that's
C	yeah I think it was the one
A	absolutely brilliant that is I I don't think anything matches it
C	mm
A	that they did you know
B	yeah
A	I mean that every track it's very strange like every track on an LP is good
B	mm mm
A	I mean it's like The Beatles isn't it like every track
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	on The Beatles LPs were good
B	well we were into Pink Floyd at one time we we just love all the
A	yeah
B	Pink Floyd stuff
C	and the
A	I've got several
C	I like The Moody Blues a lot
B	and Moody Blues with
C	yeah
B	that totally different type of music but
A	yeah
B	but The Moody Blues
C	yeah and Yes
B	oh Yes
A	mm
B	they had
C	mm
B	what was his name?
A	Rick Wakeman
B	Rick Wakeman yeah
A	he's an interesting character now when they come on the radio and talking
A	he's really he's really good I really like him
C	mm
B	he er
B	well he did a programme on on on the television
C	that was Grumpy Old Men
B	long hair yeah Grumpy Old Men
A	that's right yeah
C	cor he was grumpy on that one
B	god
A	mm
B	he was he was really grumpy
A	we yeah we saw him once it was at Crystal Palace right?
B	mm
A	and er that when he was really famous and he did this Journey to the Centre of the Earth
B	yeah brilliant
C	mm
A	and he was performing that with his band the Journey to the Centre of the Earth and
C	yeah
A	and it's all like a natural amphitheatre in Crystal Palace with a lake and he was sort of
C	great
A	they were sort of on this
A	sort of stage which is was sort of set
C	lovely
A	overlooking this lake
C	right
A	got to the bit where they er erm
B	oh right yeah
A	cos like they had this lake with the
B	yeah
A	monsters in it
C	oh
A	right? they had these blow-up sort of Loch Ness monster type things
B	did he?
A	except that they weren't quite blown up enough and then sort of like the heads were sort of like
A	not well they kept sort of collapsing and then they had
C	oh right
B	oh I see yeah
A	which was then making the mist you see
C	oh
B	I see yeah
A	for the monsters
C	lovely
A	and
C	oh
A	it was a it was a
C	mm
A	effect if it had worked
B	if it had worked properly yeah
A	but yeah most of the people were sort of interested in seeing that these roadies whether they were going to fall in the water
B	yeah
A	cos
A	sussed it out you know how to get this
B	yeah
A	into the water without having to wade in you know?
B	yeah
A	well it was alright
C	yeah
A	quite interesting
B	yeah I bet it was I bet it was interesting
A	cos that was more or less the same time when Pink Floyd when they were doing all their
C	yeah
A	magic erm
B	Ummagumma and stuff
A	no no no doing the
B	the Dark Side of the Moon yeah
A	and er
C	yeah
A	Wish You Were Here and all these sort of
B	yeah
A	and they had sort of and The Wall
B	yeah
A	I mean they had sort of really
C	mm
A	er effects didn't they?
B	yeah they did yeah
A	but it think it was The Wall we went and saw it er Knebworth
B	did you? yeah
C	oh
A	and they had this
B	yeah
A	and we couldn't be bothered to
B	well of course you were yeah
A	we couldn't be bothered and er there was this erm
B	yeah
A	and when they come to the bit about I'm sure it's smash the wall
B	oh right
C	oh
B	yeah
A	they had this sort of like an aeroplane
B	yeah
A	really slowly
C	yeah
B	did it? yeah
A	cos they had a sort of wall built on the stage
C	mm
B	yeah
A	I'm sure that was what it was
B	oh wow
A	I can remember the aeroplane and remember this
C	yeah
A	you know this scene like
B	we got a load of we got
C	the effects now are brilliant though aren't they? cos
B	yeah er yeah but
C	it's worth going just
B	when you
A	mm
B	think about
C	the lighting and the
B	they had to utilise all that
C	it's amazing isn't it?
B	years ago
A	mm
B	but the effects now
C	what they can do now
B	well yeah
A	but the best way
C	yeah
A	I mean it's sort of like David Bowie started all that didn't he?
B	yeah
A	all these fantastic sets
B	that's right
C	mm
B	he did didn't he?
A	I mean they were so fantastic no one knew what the hell what
A	it was all about you know what is this?
B	no he was he was brilliant or he still is brilliant
A	mm
B	he keeps making a comeback every now and then don't he?
A	yeah
C	mm
B	music changed though but then that's what mum er said
A	yeah exactly
B	yeah and Frank Sinatra and Bing Crosby and all them sort of people
A	yeah
B	Ruby Murray and
A	yeah my dad's favourite singers were Vera Lynn and
B	Vera Lynn yeah
A	and Bing Crosby
C	yeah
B	yeah yeah
B	same as my mum my mum was always singing Vera Lynn
A	yeah
B	and Gracie Fields funnily enough
A	what Gracie Fields?
B	no my mum
B	and there there was a
A	mm
B	she had a voice sort of that was so shrill and I'm sure the other women along the road
A	well that always used to be like in church weren't it?
B	yeah
A	when you went to church there was always one little old lady who'd singing in a really powerful
B	yes
A	treble
B	that's it yeah
B	yeah
A	warbling treble
B	that's right yeah
A	in spite of what the music called for
B	in spite of what it was yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
B	and she never kept in time with the
A	that's right yeah yeah yeah
B	and always always a bit ahead
A	I think they must have been tone-deaf or something like that
B	they must have been yeah
A	or or you know so they couldn't really suss out what was going on
B	yeah
B	well it think so
C	yeah you have
A	how'd your dentist
B	I
A	treatment go?
B	I gotta go when are we going?
C	no he's got it wrong I
A	er?
C	I kept saying it wasn't that
A	oh you went the wrong day?
B	no I won't even go cos
C	mm
A	so you haven't been yet?
B	no
A	so you ain't experienced a mouth full of putty
B	no I haven't no
A	a mouth full of bubble gum
B	oh don't I'll gag
A	er?
B	don't it make you gag?
A	well
C	no
A	the thing is
B	yeah
A	but what you had to do is sort of like
B	and relax
A	you know cos sometimes you gag because you're frightened of something going down your throat
B	yeah
A	whereas this you've gotta remember that it's not going anywhere near your throat
B	yeah
A	well you know dentists they're alright they they must er you know you're not the first person been there
B	no it's true
A	and had this
B	yeah mind you we our friend
A	mm
B	didn't he?
C	oh it was the first time he went to the dentist
B	the first time he went
C	then he was he was only tiny but yeah
A	should have stuck the
C	he's just
B	yeah
A	when they're open
C	he he isn't the easiest er
B	he is not the easiest child
C	to to to like have
B	or he wasn't
C	his hair done or anything like that
B	but he was he's a great kid he really is isn't he?
C	yeah
B	but er he didn't he wouldn't let anyone touch him
C	mm didn't want anyone to look in his mouth
A	no
C	so he bit the dentist
A	and the dentist said alright rotten teeth I don't care
B	yeah well that's what I would have said
C	yeah
C	yeah
A	you know like I say I don't suppose that's the first time that's happened to him
B	no I don't suppose it is
C	no no
A	you'd think they'd have this thing they'd put in there so that they kind of
B	yeah you'd think they're just open wide and stick something in so like
A	mm
B	they can't shut
A	only need to be a bottle cork don't it?
B	course it do yeah
A	mm
C	then I actually thought I I had bitten the dentist when they they used to send you out with gas and air
A	mm
C	and I
B	yeah
C	yeah I had to ask I had to ask
A	mm
C	I had to ask cos I was convinced that was what was going on in my head
B	well
C	you had this horrible gas and it used to come along in a
A	that was a horrible
C	bubble like it and bong burst
A	mm
C	horrible
A	they wouldn't allow it these days
C	they don't do it now do they gas
A	no no cos they need a paid anaesthetist
C	yeah
A	to be on hand
B	yes you do yes
A	cos like
C	dangerous yeah
A	it's so dangerous
B	cor and they'd stick this thing over your face that big rubber like
A	dunno never had gas myself
B	ain't you?
C	didn't you?
A	no
C	oh
B	oh I had
A	weren't allowed that that was for namby-pambies
A	we had that big old needle that
B	did you? that
A	that cast iron needle
B	that stuck into your gum and made your
A	mm
C	mm
B	eyes water
C	I had gas quite a lot
B	god I had gas too
C	till I found out I was allergic to gas anyway so
A	it's amazing how it's come on though dentistry I mean
B	cor that is innit yeah cor
A	I mean sticking needles in your gums now and you can't even feel it
B	no no they're brilliant aren't they?
A	yeah
B	but there was a case on the news the other day about they say a bloke this dentist who had er
A	oh that's right and he never bothered to do
C	yeah
A	did he have HIV? was it him?
B	we don't know yet
A	or was it
A	just that he didn't clean his
B	well that's right yeah
A	I don't think he had it did he?
B	I don't know they
A	no the
B	that was the assumption they gave you on
A	yes
B	on the news
A	yeah
B	but I never did hear the end of the story
A	it was the fact that his instruments weren't
B	weren't clean
A	cleaned proper between patients
B	yeah
A	so if any of the patients had HIV
B	had HIV
A	or anything like that
B	yeah
A	and they never
B	so they they
A	there's yeah
B	they recalled about fifty patients didn't they or something or other?
C	yeah
A	and these people are panicking oh
B	do you know if if
A	I have four children and they're gonna have the blood test to see if they're
B	and now if you have a blood test for HIV or anything that's gotta go down on your insurance policy
B	and then you have to pay an awful lot more
A	I dunno there's a lot of this stuff they keep saying
C	mm
A	this that and the rest but I'm
B	well I mean
A	well they do don't they?
B	another thing the next don't they? you never know what to believe half the time do you?
A	no
B	yeah
A	news you know
B	yeah
A	where they get people worried or what have you
B	yeah you've gotta have people worried haven't you?
A	that's right yeah
A	scare the life out of people
B	you've gotta scare the life out of them
A	just to keep them in
C	oh
A	keep control of them
B	keep control yeah you have
B	I mean it weren't weren't so many years ago when a friend of ours because of the nuclear threat from
C	yeah
C	mm
B	he literally built a shelter
C	yeah
B	in the garden
C	took all the stuff down there all provisions and stuff
B	tins of provisions and water and
A	mm well apparently there's plenty of people like that in America at the moment ain't there?
B	yeah
A	these these people who have sort of got their survival shelters
B	yeah
A	er massive great loaded guns
C	yeah
A	and god knows what
B	well we said to him you know okay you're gonna be shut down here but if
A	that's right and and if you did survive
C	mm
A	what are you gonna do then?
B	yeah and if you did
C	yeah who else is there?
B	I would say
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	in the nuclear waste
B	yeah
C	you are
B	I I've said you know if if that ever did happen I'd go I'd got to the top of the hill and go yeah come on give it to me
A	well that's
B	and that would be it there'd be no
A	that's right
B	in surviving would there?
A	cos in and if there had have been a war
B	no there wouldn't no
B	yeah
A	which wouldn't have left anything alive
B	no it wouldn't no
C	anyway we don't wanna talk about that do we?
A	anyway it might never happen
A	it didn't happen
B	it didn't happen
A	but it might happen now you see they're they keep poking Russia with a stick don't they?
B	they do keep poking Russia don't they?
A	yeah but he had a
B	oh yeah it is that's true
A	you know I mean er
C	mm
A	he's said in in his interview in Germany
B	yeah
A	in an interview in Germany last week
B	yeah yeah it's true
A	and since then they've been pushing all the time
B	yeah
A	and they are now right up against the Russian border
B	yeah
A	you know? cos they
B	yeah
A	you know a sort of a buffer zone
B	yeah
A	that's right
B	where where
A	and now
B	either or each other
A	yeah and it's all because
B	they did didn't they yeah
A	didn't they?
B	yeah yeah
A	and they said oh this is defending against
B	yeah
A	only they're all pointing the wrong way
B	yeah
A	yet when Russia wanted to put missiles in Cuba
B	well yeah oh
A	you know
B	yeah Kennedy went
A	that's right
B	I thought
A	we've come to a nuclear war that was
B	well that was about four hours away weren't it?
A	something like that
B	yeah
C	mm
A	that's right
B	anyhow we ain't got much longer left have we
C	I hope so
A	I don't know
B	yeah it is
A	sixty-seven
B	sixty-
C	seven years' time
B	that is disgusting
A	and like six years' time now
B	that's disgusting
A	it is
C	yeah
B	I mean what
C	that a long time innit?
B	especially when she's sort of like
C	yeah
A	all of the time
B	well I mean
A	and this would be the time where she could really appreciate
B	a little bit of her
C	yeah
A	having a having a sort of basic
B	life yeah
A	basic
C	yeah
A	amount of money coming in
B	yeah
A	I mean I can work through it
B	I think that's awful
A	it is
C	yeah
B	I think it's that's I mean er
C	yeah
B	the people who make these rules have got plenty of money
A	yeah
B	and they'll always have plenty of money cos they're always on the fiddle anyway aren't they?
A	that's right
B	they're always claiming their bit of
A	yeah
B	well of course they do
A	and all these er
B	yeah
B	they get loads
A	expenses and stuff
B	expenses
C	mm
B	oh
A	well you you
B	half of them
A	yeah but or it the ones you know even the ones who say you know who do it all
B	yeah
A	you know either they have a house in London and have to have one in the constituency or
B	yeah
A	vice versa
B	house yeah
A	to be done up
B	yeah yeah
A	you know
B	mm
A	and and for the and for the mortgage
B	yeah
A	when you
B	yeah
C	that's not right
A	take up why don't they say
C	it's not right
A	if you want a extra place you've gotta rent somewhere and we'll pay the rent
B	that's right yeah
A	that's why it would be fair wouldn't it?
B	that would be very fair that would be
A	but then what they'd do is they'd get the someone in the family to buy a house and rent it to them
B	well yeah
A	and that rent
C	yeah
A	would then pay the mortgage and all the upkeep
B	but the what they should have is a place like Downing street where
A	mm
B	they're in er so if if
A	there's six hundred and thirty of them ain't there?
C	mm
B	yeah
A	so they'd need a lot of property
B	well they would but I mean wouldn't it be
A	put them in a dormitory
B	yeah
B	well they got
A	cos that's right they own Chelsea barracks
B	Chelsea er barracks yeah
A	just round the corner
B	of course they have yeah
A	and they sold that ain't they
B	yeah
A	to some
B	yeah
A	and they're gonna turn it all into
B	multimillion pound
A	yeah
B	the amount of empty houses in in London is is is terrible because
A	is there a lot?
B	yeah
A	oh I know the one you're talking about it weren't all owned by one a particular but it was all owned by
B	that's it
A	and it was the most expensive houses in Britain
B	and they're all falling down
A	there was only two there's only two of them got people living in them
B	yeah
A	the whole all the rest are the massive great mansions weren't they?
B	yeah that's right
A	all falling down
B	all falling down
A	I can't remember the name either but I
B	now you see
A	mm
B	if
A	mm yeah but they ain't got the money have they?
B	well
A	and these places I mean each
B	they look at
A	one is worth like ten million innit?
B	look at the place
A	mm but the land is
B	the land is worth a
A	yeah
B	absolute fortune innit but that's a whole street which is
A	yeah
B	which is falling down
C	is it actually falling down though?
B	well
A	well it's
B	going going to
A	it's not like a street houses as you'd know I think it's out Hampstead way
C	mm
A	all on their own bit of land
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	you know with big gates going to it
B	that's right
A	and some of them were bought
C	right
B	yeah
A	you know sort of like
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	stuff like that happening and
B	ivy crawl up them and in in the house and
A	bindweed come up through the floorboards
B	yeah
C	mm
A	yeah I mean there was a thing in The Guardian where they sort of had this photo shoot in there
C	mm
A	that was all owned by some Saudi
B	yeah
A	and they'd bought it for
B	yeah
C	mm
A	so they'd
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	just by letting it sit there
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	and because there's loads of I mean this was happening a lot of these
B	go to the loo
A	a lot of these flats you know these
C	mm
A	they reckon that a lot of Chinese and African
C	yeah
A	laundering their money you know they got millions
C	gotta spend it somehow and it's
A	they well
C	what they do with it
A	they don't wanna put it in the bank in case it gets
C	yeah
A	found out and they just buy a property overseas
C	yeah
A	and see London cos of the increasing values so they're not losing anything they're gaining
C	not at all
A	but they aren't interested in living there
C	yeah
A	mm
C	mm
A	you know these really expensive houses and no one living in them
C	yeah
A	and people are having to move out and
C	mm yeah
A	except that it's patrolled by security guards
C	ridiculous isn't it?
A	it's very strange
C	mm
A	really
C	right
A	zero point one earn more than the bottom ninety percent
C	really?
A	I mean that is
C	yeah
A	that's an amazing I mean er you know it's really difficult to get your head round it and then they
C	it is
A	then they complain about all the rich people having to pay a mansion tax well if
C	mm
A	it stands to reason to keep the country going they're gonna have to pay
B	no that's true yeah
A	I was just saying to
C	yeah
A	I I don't know whether it's America or Britain or the world in general
B	yeah
A	zero point one percent of the people had more wealth than the bottom ninety percent
C	that's amazing isn't it
C	I can't
A	you know if you
C	I can't imagine that
B	that's amazing
A	it's incredible isn't it?
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	I mean you're talking about like er that Scottish couple who won a hundred and ten million on the
B	is it the euro lottery?
A	the euro lottery
B	yeah
A	right? now when you look at them they're both big fat old people
A	I mean you know it's sort of
B	had too much to eat anyway
A	they they have given
B	what?
C	oh
B	oh wow
A	well they give
B	yeah
A	two million
C	oh well
[ANNOTATION]	two milion is good	Entailment
A	they give a million well first of all to the
A	Scottish independence
B	yeah
A	and now they've just given another million pound to the Scottish National Party
B	oh wow
A	but you know you imagine what influence they they have got
B	yeah
A	I mean they could
C	mm
A	say oh I want you know I think that we you know need to develop this or do that or
B	yeah
A	we'll get that going
[ANNOTATION]	is it for develop or not	Neutral
C	yeah
B	yeah we'll get that done yeah
A	and that's just like ordinary people
C	it's yeah
B	yeah
A	and you can imagine what these big multinationals are doing
C	mm
A	they've got them dangling off the fingers haven't they?
[ANNOTATION]	person A don't know danglinf off the fingers	Neutral
B	they have haven't they yeah
A	these parliaments
B	yeah
C	you can't lose can you once you
B	that the government don't really run the country do they?
A	no
B	I mean they're just there as er puppets
A	that's right just to sort of like take the flack and
B	yeah
A	to be up front when anything happens
[ANNOTATION]	person A is talking about travel	Contradiction
B	when anything happens yeah
A	to look serious on television
B	yeah
A	but they don't run anything

B	was
A	yeah

B	yeah
A	it was you could just see a little bit of a lift

A	it was just passed
B	just in
A	but I usually go for the cheapest I can get but even then they're about fifty-six quid a pair

A	mm
B	and
A	mm
A	I mean the thing is
B	yeah
A	you if you didn't wanna change it you could just drive slowly to
B	yeah that's right
A	to a garage
B	and put a new one on
A	and then put a new one on
B	yeah yeah yeah
C	mm yeah
B	and of course that's how you ruined our tyre weren't it?
C	oh yeah
B	well I mean she only got outside and then then it come back in
C	it must have happened on the driveway yeah or just outside
A	and did what?
B	just
C	I
B	drove back in it
C	I only drove just past next door
A	mm
C	and realised it was flat
A	mm
B	that was the turning around that killed it wasn't it?
C	I shouldn't have turned round
B	you should have reversed
A	yeah
B	back in
A	but even so you know what do you do?
B	well that's right
A	well yeah I'm gonna crawl under a car these
B	no you're not
A	well anyway like on our car
C	mm
A	like to get the
B	yeah
A	I mean that's a major bloody operation
B	it is it is
A	you know you have to sort of like get it in this oh wind it down and then crawl out
B	that's right yeah
A	and the jack is in the middle of the wheel and you've got to sort of slide that out
B	yeah
A	somehow or other I mean if you were wearing anything but a set of overalls you're talking about ruining your all your clothes as well
B	well of course you are yeah
A	I mean that is
B	I can't even jack my car up our car up
A	why not?
B	that's too hard with the scissor jack on it

A	mm
B	absolutely useless you stick it in there and you're and you've got this little fine bit of wire that you've got
A	yeah
B	wind it up with
A	mm
B	but it also jacked the front wheel up so you're jacking the whole half a car up
A	whole car up oh really? oh
C	but it's only in a little like triangle bit wasn't it?
B	yeah
C	it's the
B	so I got a bloke to
C	to do it
B	from the
A	mm
B	and er I mean normally you'd you'd be able to jack it up very easy wouldn't
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	One of them performed the task.	Contradiction
B	but they these scissor jacks don't work
A	no cos they aren't even a lot of the modern ones like before you used to have a scissor jack which opened like that don't they?
B	yeah
A	but the one we got it's a sort of thing like this
B	that's it yeah
A	a sort of dog leg thing
B	yeah
