B	and then a half Bulgarian half Pakistani so yeah
A	what about me? tell him tell him I'm er
B	oh yeah I said you as well I said you and
B	mm
A	I think
C	there's gonna be banter mate
A	it's probably going to be a smaller trip basically maybe five people and erm she'll she's likely to bring
C	oh right
B	oh
A	maybe her son
C	oh
A	but only if he wants to
B	I think
A	be sick if
C	yeah she has
B	really ah
A	he's got to be he understands
B	it's weird cos like she's a really I don't I don't know who do you still hang out with what's her friend group?
A	I know
C	boys
A	I don't really know
B	but but but who
C	oh yeah
B	who specifically does she have anyone specifically?
B	oh yeah yeah yeah that's true
B	yeah
A	he used to talk to like
B	and
A	and
B	yeah yeah
A	erm
C	oh wow
A	she said that there was a personal issue at home
B	mm
A	I thought she was bullshitting
B	mm
A	then then
B	she's she's been thinking of joining the army
A	really but that's not bad I'm just that came out of nowhere
B	I think both of her grandparents are were in the army
A	really?
B	both of her grandads were in the army but she wants to be she wants to be in infantry she wants to be on the front lines
C	wow she's brave
B	she's she's yeah she she's have you she's so passionate about it if you hear her talk about it like
A	wow
B	yeah cos remember when we had to come in through erm the prefect stuff?
A	yeah
B	she went to the army people there she was talking to them about it
A	yeah
B	and she was seriously considering it
A	oh yeah
B	yeah
A	I mean normal troops are just obviously not everyone everyone that joins the army is just deployed on a front line I mean
B	er no but
A	but that's what she wants I don't know how much option you get with that
C	it's true army's hard isn't it? they expect you to have so much discipline
B	she hopes the thing is like she knows that I'm not really for sort of combat and like the army and
A	what about?
B	just like
A	the concept of being in the army or?
B	yeah like the idea of fighting for she said like she says king and country and I'm just like well we have a queen but queen and country
A	queen and country ah
B	yeah
A	this is crazy but the seats are really nice
B	every single person that is walking past has looked at us
A	no no
C	that's why I'm sitting this way I can't handle this kind of thing
A	no no no two per cent
B	when I go inside I feel like there's just going to be an alarm
A	oh jeez
C	no he was proper looking at us
A	yeah the odd one if our country went to war would you erm
B	fight?
A	yeah what would you do?
C	nope I'm
B	I dunno
A	I don't know either but maybe
C	would you fight?
A	I'd like to think so yeah
C	oh
B	I don't know cos like it depends on why we're having the war
A	exactly
C	oh I see
B	that's why that's why I'm quite against like army and stuff because a lot of
B	yeah cos yeah cos when you're when you're in the army you can't chose what cause you're fighting for
C	yeah exactly
B	sometimes you're fighting for something that is like utterly imperialist and just all for economic gain or diplomacy rather than actually helping anyone
A	mm
B	so it completely depends
A	still loads of people that fight in our army know why they're fighting or they just do it because it's their job?
B	I don't know
C	I think some people not all people some people they don't feel like they have a lot of options in life so then they just go into the army
A	yeah probably
C	wow
A	it was a way to make a difference
B	oh
C	wow
A	shut up shut up screw you
C	I didn't say anything I just said wow
A	I'd bust you
C	I just said wow
A	for nothing
B	I've never watched Peppa pig before
C	have you?
B	no they don't have it in Asia
C	mm
A	oh right
B	what happens? it's just a pig that talks is everyone a pig?
C	with her family yeah
B	oh is it a girl?
C	that's the main one
A	can you imagine how pissed off like the show got show got seen because er daddy pig didn't have a er a er seatbelt in one scene
B	in the car?
A	they didn't they didn't like not that he chose not to but they just didn't put that in
B	they didn't animate it
A	yeah
B	that's weird
C	so couldn't they just go over that episode and put a seat belt on daddy pig?
B	I'm sure that worldwide like children were jumping on their father saying take off your seat belt father pig doesn't wear one
C	I think most people didn't even notice to be honest
B	mm
C	it's us
B	yeah they're coming for us
A	yeah
B	do you feel confident
A	no no I feel like whenever I hear about places that are majority white and I go there I just feel like so many people are gonna be I know they're not and it's just generalising white people but I just feel like they're gonna be so
B	the thing is to be honest
C	they probably are
B	I don't think generalising white people is that bad
C	yeah cos it's true
B	because of the fact that
C	let's just admit it it's true
B	partly that yeah but also because erm it's better to be cautious and the safety of of a minority is better than the feelings of you know some white person
A	yeah
B	I don't know
A	but I know most of the UK doesn't have those fears so I like to think that the
B	I feel a lot of people are
A	they just don't talk about it
B	yeah
A	they don't know that what they're doing is wrong or
B	no
A	and I was eating really slowly
B	mm
C	oh you guys get the foot long wow
B	mm
C	you can handle it I think yeah?
A	do they make everything you have stand up?
B	mm
A	so who does
B	she hangs out with
A	oh yeah?
B	cos they have maths and further maths together
A	oh really?
B	yeah he does
C	oh oh
B	maybe yeah
C	oh oh I think she hung out with
A	sixth form?
C	year thirteen year thirteen
A	year thirteen oh right why did you used to speak to her more or?
C	yeah cos we had maths together and her and
A	what did you think of
C	I
A	yeah
C	she's alright
A	smiley
C	yeah she's not one of those people that you want first thing on a Monday morning like it's a bit too much for me
A	what do you mean? you don't want to
C	I dunno I'm like
A	you can't be bothered to deal with that?
C	I'm not yeah I'm not I'm not there yet I'm not ready for it
B	I know she erm cos I don't really know her cos but she's my coordinator for erm cos erm careers yeah and then
A	careers she did nothing
B	yeah that but to be honest I didn't do anything either
A	it's not really for you to it should be her chasing you up really
B	yeah but there's also the fact that I should have personal responsibility but erm
A	yeah
B	there's also the fact that I'm like whenever we used to sit in groups cos er during cricket meetings
A	yeah
B	she would not try and talk to any of us she just sat there she didn't speak to any of us it was just so odd cos me and
A	I don't know that she's that sure of herself or she doesn't really know what she's doing but er the point is I know you said you have the personal responsibility but she's been given the role and the title of assistant head girl because she's claimed that she has all these leadership skills and can bring a team together so it should be her that's pressing on it but erm did you guys ever have meetings and stuff?
B	no no
A	compared to like
B	who
A	that's so good if if it wasn't
C	yeah but he ah he avoids her so much sometimes
C	it's so awkward there's some lunchtimes that I need something from
A	well
B	I think I think I I I erm left our class prefects group chat no erm careers givers group chat because erm because you know my phone I had to change and
A	yeah
B	cos we don't do anything on it
A	I also got targeted out well er singled out
B	yeah
A	for not doing enough
B	mm
B	I never realised that like it's like every single like almost every single duty
A	all the time
B	yeah
C	do you still hate her
A	no no
C	dislike her
A	I'm I'm much better with her actually I took it back
B	yeah
A	I was
C	fake
B	fake
A	yeah no she like I think she goes higher pitched around like teachers or something I dunno or she like tries to put on a voice for I don't know anyone else
B	it's kind of odd
A	how's that sandwich?
B	it's lovely how is your sandwich?
A	it's good
