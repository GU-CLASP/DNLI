D	is that what she says?
C	was that a comment about my fringe?
D	I was going to say I wouldn't put it past her
A	yeah I know
B	but now you
C	was that a dig at my fringe?
B	to be fair you didn't cut it around your eyebrows so yeah it was
C	I did a beautiful job and I'll do it again as well and I know that I will
C	I will do it again because I've got a full fringe now
B	but why did you cut it around your eyebrows?
C	well cos I right because I couldn't see cos I I'd taken
D	yeah I just don't understand that it was like you were trying to give yourself a bat signal
C	right I'd taken my glasses off and I couldn't see because I didn't want the hair to be touching my glasses and then I used nail scissors because I didn't know where my other scissors were
A	what?
D	obviously
C	but the but the panda
D	yeah cos nail scissors are
C	so yeah
D	it'll
B	so you had an M yeah
C	shut up
D	she was channelling a bit of James Bond
A	the Mcdonald's logo
C	it was the day before the Christmas ball didn't think that through did I? at all
A	no maybe not
C	have you seen the picture from the Christmas ball? they're fucking awful I look like a whale
A	all of
B	personal whale
B	do it take a picture of
D	no because he actually he actually got really upset about it
B	yeah he does
D	he got he got really upset about it to me
C	that's cos it's really mean there's absolutely no need in it like
A	yeah it is
B	he doesn't I don't think he likes
C	does anyone?
D	well I'm not surprised after that she called him
B	no like cos like I thought yeah that I'd be pissed off about but I didn't think he'd be like
D	no he was really upset about it
B	I know he was upset about it but
C	no because he he's he's really sensitive about his weight
B	mm mm
C	and like at the minute he's at like he said to me the other day he's at the biggest that he's been in a while
D	yeah
C	and he's not very cos he didn't he used to go to like Zumba and
D	mm
C	he used to go to that and he lost quite a lot of weight and then he just put it all back on again and he's like he's quite upset about it
D	yeah
A	mm
C	so that didn't really help cos like everyone wants to look good in their swimming costume
B	and he doesn't look he doesn't look bad though
C	no he's just got he's quite a big belly
B	well I don't
D	I think that were just really harsh of
B	mm I don't know why she's done it though
D	I don't know why she did that
B	cos I don't think she's done it maliciously
D	well maybe not but she wouldn't like it if I wrote on Facebook hashtag
B	well I don't know but I don't know what goes
A	yeah
B	I don't think she'd take that too fucking kindly
A	no
C	I think she thought he'd find it funny but
A	no
D	yeah but no that's not funny
A	mm no
C	no like I don't understand what goes through her head
D	especially not when he'd been calling himself a dolphin all holiday like all holiday he referred to himself as a dolphin
C	yeah or a torpedo
D	so then why would you then put a picture on Facebook and be like whale? if anything you'd put dolphin
B	or I just wouldn't put
C	cos he said to me as well he was like you wouldn't even you wouldn't even do that and I was like yeah because it's fucking harsh
B	yeah
C	I was like us making fat jokes at each other is like a private thing like and like our friends know we do it but like I wouldn't do it on Facebook
B	yeah
C	like that's just a bit of a step too far to be honest
C	I don't know
B	but I couldn't find it on her pictures
C	well if
D	she's got it somewhere hasn't she?
C	I'm trying to yeah it's still there
