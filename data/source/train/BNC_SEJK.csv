B	smells nice
B	yes it has
B	mm yes it does
C	did a nice lot didn't it?
B	mm
C	so what have you achieved this morning?
B	mm smells good erm not a lot
C	well that's good
B	er yes I slept in a long time
C	yes
A	would you like any bread
B	erm er yes please I will have a slice
A	is that enough?
B	yes thank you that's lovely
A	I'll just get
B	thank you
C	oh yeah?
B	and
C	oh that's nice
B	emailed my friend
C	yes
B	yeah
B	read a bit
C	ah yes what do you think of that book? Summertime?
B	ah yes that's one's very good I like how it started
C	oh right
B	quite interesting
C	yeah yes it is because it's
B	yes and it's
C	I remember that one
B	it's quite interesting cos it's looking at two issues as well
C	yes
B	the erm returning soldiers
C	mm
B	and then also how the black erm
B	were treated at that time
B	but also how difficult it must've been cos they were treated very differently in France
C	yes yes that's right
B	and then they came back and then had to
C	yes
B	do all the racism and then seeing it as a sort of chance to
C	yes
B	make changes but of course people who hadn't been to war didn't see it like that
C	no
B	they just wanted to
C	no no
B	keep going in the same way and they were fine with it
C	yes
B	it must've been doubly difficult for them
C	mm
B	yeah
C	because you have to be so knowledgeable haven't you? about the facts there's no point if you've got it all wrong
B	yes that's right it seems like that author did
C	mm yes
C	no I found it very interesting
B	mm
C	treated very badly weren't they? the soldiers on the
B	terrible
A	was that the First World War?
B	yes
A	yeah
B	this is about the erm black soldiers returning to
A	right
B	Florida
B	which was particularly bad because they had more lynchings there than anywhere else in the States and when they came back it was the depression as well
A	yeah
B	so actually it was probably worse than before they left less work
A	yeah
B	and the whites wanted to consolidate power
A	yeah
B	so it actually got worse for them
C	and haven't things changed in a relatively short time?
B	yeah it's good mm
B	yes it is good
C	mm
C	mm
B	you don't really see that in the UK but
C	no
A	it seems to be
B	yeah sort of underlying racism in
A	yes
C	mm
B	in er well yes er what I thought was interesting was the segregation
C	oh
A	oh yeah yeah
B	ate in the cafeteria the blacks would all sit at one table and the whites would all sit at others that was totally by their choice
A	mm
B	I thought that was very worrying
A	mm
C	yes
B	cos er that wouldn't happen in the UK would it?
C	no
A	no
B	it would never be that extreme
C	no no
B	mm
B	yes they do
A	and of course there's immediately there's an immediate riot
B	yes
B	well yes it does seem there's problems of
A	yeah it's more
B	institutionalised racism as well
A	yeah
B	mm
C	but erm I think things have moved on a lot cos when I was at college there were just about four African students
B	mm
C	and I was
[ANNOTATION]	Person C had forgotten about the social security	Contradiction
B	mm
C	erm you know for the holidays and things so I'd go and sort of chat
B	yes
C	but er but otherwise they seemed to be completely separate they
B	oh right
C	separate race but that wouldn't happen today would it?
A	no
B	no
C	no
B	yes
C	right I'm just going to check the cauliflower
B	mm
B	kept well
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Person A is thinks  checking  the cauliflower is a good idea	Entailment
B	getting soup twice today
A	mm
B	pea pod soup
[ANNOTATION]	Person B said it is good to have soup two times a day	Entailment
A	oh yes do you need anything with it?
B	spring onions yes
A	yes
B	clever though you can make soup from anything
A	yeah yeah
B	I don't know I haven't
A	mm
B	read it
A	shall I take that
[ANNOTATION]	Person A said that could he get that soup	Neutral
B	oh thank you
B	nice cider
C	mm
A	well I'm
B	oh right oh that's a lot
A	and I'll do a third
B	yes on that side one?
A	down that side yes
B	mm
A	it won't be finished but it'll be
B	yes
A	erm
[ANNOTATION]	Person A think is more than enough that he could finish it	Neutral
B	oh
A	just in a wheelbarrow
B	yes has the lavender gone in?
B	oh that's good oh it's good to get them in now we've just had all the rain so that's good isn't it?
A	mm yes
[ANNOTATION]	Person A is not sure that having rain is a good thing	Entailment
B	mm
A	yeah
B	cos it's not that cold in the winter
A	in the summer
B	it's more about the wind and the shelter
B	yeah
B	ah yes that's right I wouldn't mind going there one day have a look
A	forget what it's called
B	have you been?
A	no
B	well I wouldn't mind stopping in there yes that must be alright mustn't it? they're outside
A	well yes of course that's on a
B	yeah and grandpa had a vine didn't he? in that greenhouse for years
A	yeah
B	but I think the roots were outside
A	yeah
B	mm so you're not tempted to grow chillies after the front page story in The Times?
B	no
A	but you know
B	I suppose if you're on your own it's not difficult to
A	no
B	put one in whatever you're cooking
A	no
B	guess you could do something easy like chilli con carne
A	cook about normally about three three times a week yeah
B	that's just one pot cooking isn't it?
A	yeah
B	mm
B	yes that's just one pot and then rice
A	yeah
B	yes
A	what's it called?
B	dal D A L
A	I I don't know actually
B	ah well you can
A	is it spicy?
B	yes so it's a very cheap meal so everywhere in the Gulf if you go to a local restaurant properly local then it'll be run by either Bangladeshis or Indian
A	mm
B	and they never have a menu and they can't speak English but if you say dal
A	and is it
B	it's just lentils basically lentils red lentils
A	I've got quite a lot of lentils I've got red and green
B	ah yes you can either use the small red ones or the bigger erm split
A	green
B	yellow lentils and then you just basically
A	yeah
B	boil them until they turn to mush it's like porridge
A	yeah
B	thing really and then in a different pan you'd fry an onion and some chilli
A	yeah
B	and then add that at the end with butter a knob of butter and if you want people put in chopped tomatoes it's very one of those really economical meals
A	yeah
B	which you can see
A	and do they have anything with it? like rice? or garlic bread?
B	erm yes you often get rice or bread with it
A	something just to
A	yeah
B	so the bread usually bread cos then you just
B	scoop it yes or you can thin it down a bit and make it into soup but erm yes that's quite nice I have that for lunch sometimes
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	is it hot? er hot? or?
B	yes but you can choose how hot
A	you can just have less of it can't you?
B	yes you can choose how much you put in yes
C	to put in
B	yes er but if you have it in a restaurant it's very hot oh this looks lovely thank you
C	that's good cos there's plenty more
B	oh lovely smells nice
A	thank you
B	mm nice colour
A	yeah
B	that's the
A	yes
C	but going back to novels I think
B	mm
C	you can
B	yes
C	you know when you read
B	mm that's true
B	so you liked that one did you?
C	I thought it was very good I think it was was it her first book? I think it was
B	oh is it? mm okay
C	yes
B	no mm
C	he's good
B	oh right
A	is he a comedian?
C	no
A	no not him
C	no
B	what are you reading now mum?
C	erm I am reading that one I told you I was reading before which was
B	ah the Fay Mcdermott? yeah
C	Mcdermott yes erm the title escapes me but it's been very good
B	mm
C	erm so I'm just trying to finish that off this afternoon
B	oh that's nice it's lovely weather
C	yes and then I could pass it on to
B	mm
C	and I think I'll give the daughter one
B	ah yes
C	mm
B	I finished The Taxidermist's Daughter and put that in there too
C	oh right okay yeah that'll be nice
B	mm nice meat that is
C	oh good and you got this one erm somewhere else didn't you? not the supermarket
A	no the I found them on the way to
B	oh right mm that's good
B	is it cheap there?
A	erm no it might be a tiny bit more
B	oh okay
A	er a little bit more than the supermarket but erm
B	it's fresh
A	it's er it's a very very very big herd of
B	oh right oh that's nice
A	and that's the
C	mm
A	in between
B	mm
A	which is called
B	oh okay
A	and they it's a big big butcher on this farm
B	oh right mm
A	it's a lady who runs it
C	which is particularly nice
A	mm
C	it's really tender and it's cooked a bit longer
A	yeah yeah
B	mm it's a good way to do meat
C	but I think when you're cooking for two it's to be honest it's worth paying a bit more for quality if er if you're doing steaks
B	mm
C	I mean that's different cos that is a huge expenditure
B	yes
A	yeah
B	no it's true things like stewing steak's terrible isn't it?
C	mm
B	full of fat
C	mm
B	it's got a nice flavour the sauce that's the beer isn't it?
C	oh yes I'm glad you liked it
B	mm
B	oh that's nice I told
C	oh right okay
B	strange coincidence wasn't it?
C	yes it is you gave me that one didn't you? that that that cookery book?
A	er yes
A	one of those Good Housekeeping or something
B	yes they're good those ones
C	mm
B	no only that email

C	oh yes okay yes I had this the photos and about two lines but you know
B	mm
C	it's nice to know she's okay
B	yes
C	so grandpa and
B	oh that's nice
B	mm
B	yes
C	mm very keen
B	yes
C	he well he we don't know he
B	ah
B	oh right
B	yes
C	erm so it's gonna cost an awful lot of money
B	yes
C	probably gave him something towards it
B	uhu
C	and he was meant to have it this month
B	mm
C	mm
B	oh good
C	yes I
B	mm
C	and
A	yeah
B	when did you last see
C	erm that's a good question
B	ah right
C	the ninetieth
B	mm
C	and
B	oh that's nice
C	it's a long way to drive and he gets very very tired
B	mm
C	but he came in on a Zimmer frame
B	oh really?
C	yeah
B	mm
C	it was quite bad
B	unlucky cos it's
C	mm
B	some people it doesn't develop very fast does it?
A	mm no
B	go for years
B	oh right
C	and this is the sort the bad sort
B	mm
C	so he
A	mm
C	could be
B	and
C	erm yes that's right
B	that was awful for them
C	well she died quite young though didn't she?
B	mm
B	they had to put her in a home
C	mm
B	her dad got just couldn't cope in the end
C	mm
B	very depressed as well
B	mm
C	that she actually moved
A	mm
C	cos he's erm you know a lot of the time
B	mm
B	oh er I think I met her once mm
C	yeah and she was in a wheelchair but I
B	mm
C	don't think she is any worse
B	no
C	did you enjoy that?
A	yes I did
C	oh good
A	mm
C	can always pour a bit of extra beer in
B	oh I don't know
C	mm
A	pardon me
C	too much choice
B	that's right
C	have you
B	oh right yes it's a full day for you
A	mm well I don't normally do that twice but erm just
B	dad said he put the lavender in
C	ah yes I've heard
A	yeah
C	that sounds good doesn't it? does it look nice?
A	yes
C	mm
A	it's a bit
C	yes
B	mm
B	yes
A	I've put
B	mm
C	and does it flower once a year? or twice?
A	well sometimes twice
C	mm
B	and it flowers for a long time
C	oh does it? oh that's good
B	mm
C	oh good
B	yes
C	that'll be nice
B	yes
A	yeah
B	oh right I worked on a lavender farm in Australia
C	oh did you?
B	it was lovely can you imagine how beautiful it was?
A	yeah
B	just purple for you know acres and acres
A	yes you you
B	just all
A	yes they're very rare aren't they?
A	well you get them in the south of France
B	yes
A	and there's one or two in England I was reading
B	ah right yes
A	lavender farms
B	cos it's very specialist
A	yeah
B	and you need really to have your own distillery or whatever it's called on
A	yeah
B	on site so then that becomes specialist
A	yeah
B	cos they extract the oil don't they usually?
A	yeah
C	so what did you have to do? sort of weeding and watering?
B	well no I think it was that was all taken care of it was all mulched so and they were well established
C	oh yes
B	no
C	mm
B	no it was nice
A	did you want any more
B	I'm full actually but thank you
A	mm
B	it was very nice
C	did you want more?
A	er no I think er thank I would like more
A	but I I think I'll
A	leave it for now
B	okay
A	are you going to have more?
C	yes
B	oh I don't think that's a problem in this house
A	yeah so er
B	I suppose the other problem with having it in the middle
C	mm
B	is you don't really keep track of how much you've had
C	no
B	if it's on a plate you know you've had one portion
A	a helping yeah
C	yes
A	and if someone yeah
B	yes but it's like with wine isn't it?
A	yeah
C	mm
B	someone's always topping your glass up it's quite hard
A	to know how much
C	mm
B	to keep track of how much you've had
A	yes
C	yes
B	whereas if you have a
A	yes
B	then you know you've had that much
A	yeah
C	yes that's true
A	yes we all have a bottle each
C	but some people don't like it especially if you don't know them erm they've got small appetites and you serve
A	oh yeah got too much
B	yeah that's true
C	and I think
B	yes it could be a bit embarrassing if
C	yes
B	or there's something that they don't like
B	and then they feel bad cos they're leaving it
A	yeah you're leaving it yeah
C	mm
B	yeah
C	so we think you er you're alright
A	well that's how I
A	no
B	well
A	oh
C	oh that's good
B	which is
A	and that's Fridays?
B	yes
A	is that right?
B	yes Fridays
A	January?
B	till January till April
C	that's
B	at
C	mm
B	good to come back and
B	have something
C	mm
B	lined up
A	yeah
C	yes
B	you know you know at least I've got time plenty of time to do any outside reading as well
A	yes
C	mm
B	yeah
C	well it's
B	no
A	yeah
B	fixed
C	yes
A	yeah
B	focus isn't it?
C	yes
B	it's nice cos it means I'll definitely do it now otherwise I've lost the deposits
A	well yeah
B	otherwise you could put it off and then not pick on the course and then it goes on another six months
B	and then
A	and it gives you time then to be on the if it goes alright
B	mm
A	apply after Easter for
B	that's right the
A	the next
B	yes
A	yeah
B	yes that's right
A	rather than losing the next September does it start in September the next one?
B	yes
A	ah
B	I think so
A	yes
C	and that's two years?
B	yes but part time again
C	yeah what? two days a week?
B	I can't remember that one
C	no
B	wasn't that
C	no
A	might be could be one day a week
B	might be yes
A	cos it's
B	cos it's for longer
A	thirty or thirty-five
B	yes they skip the holidays they said
A	mm
B	but otherwise it's
A	yeah
B	all the time
C	mm
B	will be interesting anyway
C	yes it will
B	and I was er they've sent their the biographies of their tutors and interesting they they were pretty much I think all of them were PGCE trained
C	oh were they?
B	teachers for years
A	mm wanted a break yeah
B	and they moved into it and er most of them still work
B	in schools but as counsellors now
A	yes
B	or behavioural units for children excluded from schools
C	oh right
A	yeah
B	quite interesting so yes
A	so similar so still linked then to schools
B	yes
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B finds the conversation boring.	Contradiction
A	yeah
B	abuse you know and alcoholic abuse that sort of thing
C	mm
B	but yes I suppose there's a lot of overlap isn't there?
C	yes
B	jobs particularly if you stay working with teenagers
C	yeah
B	or something
[ANNOTATION]	Counsellors are needed against alcoholic abuse for teenagers.	Entailment
C	mm
C	uhu
C	so you might get a job
B	maybe yes
C	yes
B	mm
A	they used to have a I said to
B	yeah that's good
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B is looking for a job in the field for a long time now.	Neutral
C	yes
A	full time
B	it's surprising
C	mm
A	yes it was yes
B	still not
A	I didn't come across that not a full time
B	no
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B doesn't want to get the job.	Contradiction
A	member of staff
B	I've only seen it once
A	ever ever since
C	mm
B	yeah I think it will come in more now
A	yeah
B	but you
B	you think for the teachers that must make a big difference being able to refer someone
[ANNOTATION]	It's easy for the teachers to propose someone.	Contradiction
A	yeah
C	yes
B	internally
C	yes
B	cos external it would have to be terrible before
A	yeah
B	anything's done cos they're not going to send people in are they?
C	mm
B	mm would be nice
C	mm
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	you'll be analysing us
A	mm
C	behaviour when you come
A	I know
B	watch what you say
B	yeah
C	I was nervous with
B	yeah
C	it doesn't bother me now
B	no she's not being paid so she's not bothered
A	no she's not doing it properly
C	sometimes she asks you too many questions but you just sort of say well I just don't want to do this or say this
A	I don't want to do
C	well I'm glad you like that
B	mm
A	yeah
B	it's very nice
C	yes you'll have to rate the menus
B	mm
B	yes put them on Tripadvisor
C	now do you like and it's nothing to do with my cooking fish and chips from the shop?
B	ah yes I do
C	oh well I get
B	occasionally
C	yes occasionally well we hardly ever have them and we do like them
B	yes
C	and they're good
B	oh right
C	I thought when we come back from
B	yes
C	that'll be a nice thing to do wouldn't it?
B	oh yes that'd be lovely
C	to stop there
B	mm
B	yes that's good
B	oh good
C	and then Sunday

B	yeah
C	I think we only had
B	oh right

B	ah
C	she was about five
B	yeah
C	so
B	yeah
C	that's awkward for her isn't it as a five-year-old?
B	mm
C	it bothered her so I think
B	yeah
C	she she needed another girl didn't she really?
B	yes
C	two boys and
B	yes

B	yes
C	I'll get you some dessert
B	oh thank you
C	stewed fruit again with the remainder of the custard
B	would you like some help?
C	no you can just sit and relax
B	oh that's good
C	and let your thoughts flow through you
B	dear
C	and analyse how the conversation's been
B	yeah
C	how we've reacted on this meal

A	yes
C	yes
C	mm it's a real problem isn't it?
B	yes
C	yes
B	yes
C	and there was somebody killed I think yesterday trying to
B	there seems to be a lot
B	mm
C	mm
B	which is true
C	mm yes
B	er really they just need to change the benefits system and then it would stop of its own accord wouldn't it?
A	yeah
B	it's because
A	yeah because you don't get that in France
B	yes if if they see it as the easy option
A	mm
B	even though it's harder to get here
C	oh yes yes
B	then they're going to come

C	mm yes
A	yes we need it
B	yes make it the same
C	mm
A	that when you arrive here
B	mm
A	currently you get it all from day one
B	yes
C	and then there was that article I nearly sent it to you
B	ah yes I saw that mm
C	I didn't read it all cos it's quite a long article
B	no I didn't
C	but it's interesting but that was actually always one of grandpa's arguments for sending
A	yeah
C	than if you went to state school
B	yeah I think still mm
C	yes well it sounds like it
B	certain industries
A	yeah
C	yes
B	like journalism it's all
C	yes
B	private school
C	yes
A	mm
B	children mm mm
C	but it said towards the end of the article cos I skip read it that people from state schools erm will actually stick at their jobs longer
B	ah right
C	than people who have been in the private sector they often chop and change perhaps they're more fussy that's just great for the
B	mm
A	would you like coffee
B	oh yes please
C	oh yes that was from
B	oh was it? oh that's nice
C	well yes that's good
B	well not now but when I
