C	car passed the MOT
A	that passed it? oh brilliant
C	yeah cor that'd have been a nightmare that have I've had I've been doing it since Saturday I think
A	yeah?
C	yeah and I went even down the old bank holiday Monday and er that was the the what they what we used to call a fan belt and they call an auxiliary erm drive belt
A	oh
C	because that don't just drive well it don't drive the fan any more because
A	no that doesn't
C	there's no fan cos er that's an electric fan and that's not driven off the engine
A	yeah
C	and erm that go round the air conditioning pump that go round the crank
A	oh yeah that's right
C	that go round the power steering and that go
C	and they go and that goes round two one tensioner pulley and then another adjusting pulley
A	yeah
C	and that go round in that's a jigsaw puzzle really to figure out and you haven't got the room cos the belt is wider than the gap
A	oh yeah to get it into
C	and the side of the inner wing so you have to twist it to get it in and then you got to make sure that run how that supposed to run
A	yeah
C	I have to replace it
C	there ain't no time chain there time belt that's the separate one that
A	yeah it's a separate
C	that's another one inside
A	that's another one yeah
C	but the problem was the belt went and that was getting worse and worse cos that was chafing off and moving over cos they run in them little
A	yeah they do yeah
C	thin grooves
A	that's right yeah
C	an old groove so I erm what did I do? yeah what happened what caused it was a chip in the
A	yeah
C	cos they made of some I don't suppose that's plastic similar to plastic material than the actual pulley and that bit of chip came off it and and then that
A	yeah yeah
C	so basically you end up with no belt so I had to get another tensioner pulley sixty-one pounds and twenty P and erm
A	couldn't you get one up the yard?
C	well
A	must be
C	you get getting half and if that's any good
A	that's true that is true if that's no good then
C	you cos that's a lot of aggravation to go to but that's a nightmare to to fit
A	yeah
C	because for the one reason that go that's got a shoulder on on the pulley
A	yeah
C	on the bottom of the pulley and then that go in a recess that shoulder
A	yeah
C	well what had happened that had seized into the shoulder so you you
A	yeah yeah and you
C	and you can turn that and then that that'll then push the belt that and push that other pulley up and then you can pin it so that hold up in the air
A	yeah
C	but because it was seized in the
A	oh crikey
C	so in the end I had to take the power steering pump off
A	what?
C	the alternator off erm what else something else? er alternator power steering pump and then to get to the the bottom the where that go on to the er there's like a spring heavy duty fairly heavy duty spring
A	yeah
C	two erm fittings where bolts go fully
A	yeah
C	I had to take the whole erm casting off at the engine
A	all of the all of those off yeah
C	yeah take the whole casting what hold everything
A	yeah
C	to get this bit because you have to get it off to get through this hole to to undo this
A	yeah
C	this thing to get the the spring out to get the
A	oh god
C	so that was a cor that was a nightmare cos you ain't got the right
A	well you do yeah
C	so I I tried to make tools up
A	yeah
C	didn't finish it till about five o'clock yesterday
A	didn't you?
C	no cos erm I had to cancel the MOT cos I'd got to have an MOT yesterday that was booked for quarter past ten yesterday and I had to cancel it
A	but that passed you did a good job did you?
C	yeah yeah I welded and everything and that just a
A	yeah so you're okay then that passed?
C	I'm alright for another year
A	well
C	yeah I'll do it yeah put em one on and but I reckon I don't know if that will go another year cos I think got the back end that's there's a bit of corrosion getting there and that's really awkward welding cos that's sort of right where the back suspension rod is
A	oh right
C	and that's right above that so
A	is it? oh
C	I done a fair bit of welding on one side today
B	right just got to nip off to the
A	library
B	library
C	I've postponed you?
A	no no no
B	they're overdue so I've got to go
A	what you're going to take a book back?
B	it's only walking up the road
C	oh right yeah
A	just up the road luckily
C	oh that's the er mobile library
A	yeah the mobile library that's handy that is yeah
C	oh yeah
B	the erm computer doesn't print from
A	what again?
B	computer it's
A	I'll sort that
C	what's that wireless?
A	yeah yeah
C	yeah that do play up sometimes don't they?
A	yeah that's easy enough to do cos that's she she'll put it print but that won't print by wi-fi so you just got to change that to wi-fi and then it'll print look I don't know why it won't stay on
C	no that's weird innit? I don't have a lot of trouble with the wi-fi on on the printer but what I do have if anything gets stood on top of the printer
A	yeah
C	you know we'll put like papers and things and then they get taller and taller
A	yeah they do don't they?
C	and then that put some sort of pressure on the top of the printer and then that that won't go
A	no
C	that jam the actual cartridge where that run up and down
A	yeah
C	that the the printing head is jammed so you got to open it up
A	yeah these printers they're they're so cheap but the ink the ink is dearer than gold
C	yeah yeah dearer than gold is it?
A	what about that hey? yeah for how much they put in
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about printers	Entailment
C	yeah they don't put a lot in do them cartridges do they?
A	they don't put a lot in now you buy a new printer and you just get enough to print off the sheet and then you got to fill it up you got to get refills
C	yeah yeah
A	they used to put all the refill in the printer you know?
C	they got
[ANNOTATION]	they are not sure about put all refill in the printer or not	Neutral
A	you know? they don't now they just put a sample in
C	that's so they can sell em of a bit cheaper but
A	yeah but the money they must earn
C	yeah they must earn a lot of money out of the printing ink I used to print and mark stuff but I don't print so much now
A	no neither do we
C	cos I don't know I think that's I think for a couple if I get a colour one I think the black and white one is about ten pound and the colour one is about nineteen or something
A	yeah yeah
C	yeah about nineteen quid for a
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about printers	Entailment
A	I think ours are twenty-three quid each
C	yeah
A	cos there's coloured ones
C	yeah
A	there's three different colours you have to buy them
C	you got to buy yours individually?
A	and then there's the the photo black
C	yeah
A	and then you have to buy the printing black so if you're printing a photo that's got photo black on it instead of printing black
C	yes oh
A	ah
C	I didn't know that I always put did photos just with my ordinary
A	yeah yeah
C	thing they come out alright
[ANNOTATION]	they are not sure about photo printing	Neutral
A	yeah they come out good enough don't they?
[ANNOTATION]	they are not sure about come out	Neutral
C	yeah
A	so as long as they come out good enough
C	well they stopped making my printer now that's Kodak as well they don't make em any more
A	I know cos they yeah
C	they don't make em any more
A	yeah no they're finished they didn't even do printing now do they? Kodak they they they
C	no
A	they finished
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about  Kodak printer	Neutral
C	you can still get the cartridges for em though
A	can you yeah?
C	yeah
A	until the sold out
C	until they yeah probably but you know what the Chinese will do then?
A	well yeah yeah
C	they'll make more won't they?
A	I'll just put that in the sun because
C	oh we got to thaw bread out yeah you're don't thaw it out in the microwave then?
A	no that'll make it go gooey and soft
C	yeah it do doesn't it yeah?
A	we got to have a
C	oh dear
A	so how's
C	he ain't to bad about the same no change where the OCD is anyway?
A	is he?
C	no that's a that's an that's how I I told you I done his bathroom
A	yeah
C	didn't I? his toilet and that and then put he's got his own washing machine so that give me little more
A	yeah
C	freedom in the kitchen and that cos I used to have all the paper everywhere didn't I?
A	yeah course you did yeah
C	the kitchen roll covering up everything but yeah he's alright but that just that's not changed I go home I'll go home now and and when I go home they'll be paper hanging over the the the light well I got little light what you if you want to read anything you know
A	yeah
C	and the paper hanging over that and then he take my phone out of the holder on the wall cos we got two one for him and one for me and he cover that up with paper and he cover the TV remote up with the paper and where I sit with the paper
A	does he? oh dear
C	mm god the amount of kitchen roll that's unbelievable yeah that's all good stuff as well
A	well he never used to be like that did he?
C	no no
A	where did he get him from?
C	I don't know no cos I know when he was about fourteen and that fifteen that didn't start till he was just turning sixteen I don't know whether that has anything to do with when he used to work at McDonald's cos he didn't like the way some of the youngsters there were not very hygienic on their handwashing and when they went to the toilet and that
A	yeah
C	so that could have had something to do with it yeah erm but yeah that isn't that's not improved but it's not got
A	worse
C	too you know
A	too much worse
C	the kitchen roll has always been that's always been the same you know? it's just that's moved from all over the house just into the living room now so it ain't quite so bad erm whereas that used to be all in the kitchen and I couldn't I had to wait while he when he using the
A	yeah
C	cos if I went home and then I
A	was it?
C	yeah and er cor yeah everywhere that was like the house made of kitchen roll
A	it must cost you something doesn't it?
C	that don't he pay for it out of his money
A	does he? is he still seeing anyone about it?
C	no they they they don't bother any more
A	they don't?
C	they used to come round the clinical nurses but he's had a clinical nurse you know
A	yeah
C	erm a a psychiatrist and a psychologist
A	has he yeah they can't get through to him?
C	no no that's er well like I said before that's to do with the serotonin and that in the brain and
A	yeah
C	that's a brain that's a thing in the head
A	yeah
C	and you know that's no matter how much you you know that's logic to us but to him that's not logic
A	course it isn't no no
C	you know and you can tell him and that that don't mean nothing
A	no
C	you know they
A	well the thing is that people have gone to in small doses anyway
C	yes it's all millions of people all over the world
A	if I go outside for instance don't matter whether they touch anything or not if I go outside when I come indoors I have to wash my hands
C	yeah yeah
A	have to otherwise you know I feel
C	yeah
A	dirty if you know what I mean so I can understand everything really
C	yeah yeah
C	yeah
A	he was married to her he'd go round and he'd touch stuff and see if that's mucky
C	yeah
A	you know he he was a bit like that yeah a bit over the top with her of course they used to smoke then anyway so I can't the sense
C	no no if you smoke that's
A	and
A	yeah
C	yeah she she she used to be on the way to getting bad but he caught her or he forced her to get it seen to before that went too far you know?
A	yeah
C	so she she control it a lot more than she used to pull the curtains about so many times and wash her hands till they like
A	yeah
C	he don't do that he just wear plastic gloves all the time
A	did he?
C	yeah he buy boxes of gloves
A	what latex ones? or
C	yeah Sainsbury's they have box of gloves he'll buy a couple of boxes of them and then sometimes he run out everything he have to put glove on gloves on for erm but yeah he's er
A	well it's better than covering stuff up then?
C	yeah and that's
A	that's better for you though
C	but he he yeah he used to wash his hands so much they'd all
A	get sore and
C	go red they were like red and crack open and that
A	yeah
C	but now cos he wear the gloves and that they you don't er they're not quite so bad as they used to be
A	I couldn't well I mean I do feel awful to him but that must be fairly hard for you to put up with all the time innit?
C	yeah you work round it people do say that but you get in a system you know you get used to you know erm you just sort of work around him you know you get used to he know he trusts me if his mum come round to see him he don't trust her he watch where she got what she touch and if he thinks she's touched something he'll he'll either not use it again or spend ages cleaning or something
A	right
C	but if she come round I try and be there now so
A	yeah
C	I make the tea and I got in the kitchen and she all she had to do is if she want to go to the toilet or something she that's it you know he's
A	did you?
C	lock on the toilet bathroom door toilet what I done for him lock on that so he makes sure they're all locked up
A	so no one else uses em
C	so nobody else can go in there and that and touch his stuff but he trusts me you know you leave his milk in the fridge cos he say he always say I trust dad cos he cos we I know how he works you see? so I work round to keep him happy I don't touch his stuff
A	yeah no
C	you know and I avoid it and if I'm
A	yeah
C	you know whereas his mum if she come round she don't think cos she ain't living with it all the time
A	well course she isn't no
C	she's just
A	does she know she he's got that does she?
C	oh yeah she knows yeah she knows he's got it but yeah I just work round it now I just
A	did she get married yet?
C	no she's with he's alright this one but she did go off with some weirdy ones didn't she?
A	yeah yeah
C	you know when she went off with the em that druggy bloke didn't she?
A	yeah
C	and then I thought they'd took
A	yeah
C	she's been in
A	yeah
C	and that's probably where
A	probably yeah there's no telling is there
C	but
A	is she?
C	yeah she yeah
A	you see her still do you?
C	only when she come round to see
A	yeah yeah yeah yeah
C	yeah she's er the bloke she's with now he's alright
A	yeah
C	yeah he's decent sort of you know he ain't one of these
A	weirdys
A	yeah
C	that's all you can do you can't do nothing else can you?
A	no no
C	the the
A	yeah
C	but the stuff he's learnt and people don't realise you know all about what's in the how the Bible is written
A	that's right
C	he said that's that's an insult to your intelligence cos the god in there god is telling people to kill people
A	yeah what in
C	what people
A	all loving
C	benevolent and and and that and he says for the hypocrisy and er and that's right and some of the stuff he get in his head the words he come out cos him and
A	yeah yeah oh that would be good
C	because he's got an
A	answers yeah
C	he's got the answers cos he talk with people over the internet on his Xbox
C	yeah he
A	yeah I know what you mean
C	erm and he get people from America and that and some of them are hard line Christians or whatever or whatever religion they are
A	yeah
C	they're all got their beliefs and and he he he'll tell em you know they'll say well your god will say do this and then it's give me a reason to why you believe that's okay
A	yeah
C	doing this and they can't they can't there's no really you can't give a credible reason why it's okay to to go and kill children and
A	no you can't I mean this was the whole point about religion that's the only well I should think that's just about the only excuse that people have had to kill each other
C	yeah that causes world wars than
A	it's caused more wars than anything else
C	yeah yeah yeah
A	I think Jesus he said I mean I'm not religious I'm just quoting

A	yeah to to
C	to do anything
C	the engine bay yeah yeah you could get round
C	yeah you could get to things you could get to your bolts
A	yeah
C	you could but now they they
A	you can't do nothing on it
C	they design it on a computer screen
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Person A agrees with Person C that they are designed by a computer	Entailment
C	with the engine out
A	yeah
C	and then they lower the body on to the engine and the running gear
A	that's it yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Person A agrees with Person C	Entailment
C	and they don't think about the people who have to work on it
A	no no
C	that the people I think I told you Christmas that when I see them people when I used to go the GES they had that garage out that way near
A	oh yeah yeah
C	and they now only rent vans cos they done a van rental and the vehicle repairs but see now they only rent the vans out now she say because every year they have to upgrade the software for the computer for each
A	individual car yeah yeah
C	and then you they they're changing the registration you know to every half year aren't they?
A	yeah
C	and so that when they do that they even do different modifications and change the actual car
A	yeah
C	so you you have to be exactly specific when you want the parts
[ANNOTATION]	Person C had forgotten about the social security	Contradiction
A	yeah yeah
C	and that's all that's all a way of getting you to go to the dealership so they get all the work and charge you phenomenal amounts of money
A	get all the work yeah yeah yeah
C	to to do the job
A	well I have the well I know why
[ANNOTATION]	Person A is feeling so bad about the things that Person C said	Contradiction
C	yeah
A	no
C	now it's
A	yeah
C	six hundred pound for the headlight and that's without the special bulbs what go into them
A	oh god
B	oh
C	and then he said you got to take half the front off the car to to get to replace it and he say you got to do the same if you have to replace the bulb
A	even with that little one out there I've got you have to take the
B	yeah
A	you know that that Astra I've got out there
C	yeah
A	you have to take half the thing away to get a bulb into it
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	The headlights are not very cheap.	Entailment
C	yeah
A	and that takes you ages innit?
B	it's silly isn't it just to replace the bulb
C	it's it's crazy
B	isn't it?
A	just to fit the bulb I had to have a a run and that a day day time running lamp no I didn't have any of the tools I had to fit anything
[ANNOTATION]	Changing the bulb is not such a big deal.	Entailment
C	no
A	and I
C	cos there's no
A	yeah
C	er er or metric er metric spanners
A	metric yeah
[ANNOTATION]	It is not a french key that is needed.	Entailment
C	which is now the norm you got torques drive you got star drives you got female star drives male star drives female torques male torques
A	male star drives yeah
A	that's pathetic innit?
C	why? that's not necessary you the different ones I haven't one that that there er part I took off that framework
A	yeah
C	I took off that had Allen screws and and bolts so why? why?
A	yeah why change it?
C	why
A	yeah
C	why
A	why don't yeah why?
C	these people are
A	they just make it awkward that's just like if anything go wrong with with er them they were telling me down there that this is ages ago now they had these motherboards if you like they pull it out and put a new one in and that costs hundreds of pounds
C	yeah
A	it's just like a computer motherboard
[ANNOTATION]	Motherboards are a complicated hardware object.	Neutral
C	yeah
A	you know? they they can't tell what's wrong with the motherboard because something has gone wrong with it and and that don't the the circuits don't work
C	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	A motherboard is metallic.	Neutral
A	well they can find out that the circuits still work but they can't repair it so they had to take the motherboard out fit another motherboard in and then your motor is okay again but that costs hundreds
C	yeah
A	just for the stupid little pretty circuit
C	yeah I said I say to
A	yeah yeah cos I bet you pay for it in the end don't you?
C	well yeah well you do you the phenomenal amount of money they they would charge you
[ANNOTATION]	It's a complicated process to fix a motherboard.	Entailment
A	yeah
C	because you can't do it yourself if you work it out you're probably worse off
A	you are yeah I mean that little one we got out there you open the bonnet up and go better
C	no everything's covered up now as well?
A	it's all covered up yeah
C	they got big cover over the top
A	even underneath
C	yeah
A	you go underneath to to look at any anything underneath that's
C	yeah
A	and that's you got to take half the base away to get to anything on the gearbox or the crank shaft or whatever not the crank shaft but what's that called the one that go from the gearbox to the front end thing
C	drive shaft
A	drive shaft yeah
C	that's the drive shaft on the front or prop shaft on the back
A	on the back yeah prop
C	oh that's my phone it's getting flat
B	right
C	technology you see?
A	yeah yeah technology is useless
C	I think I'll tell you what they how things are going with vehicles if you were if you had the money and you started to make a more basic vehicle for the
A	yeah
C	who likes to do his own car
A	yeah
C	I bet you'd be on a winner because
A	I bet you would yeah yeah
C	because you imagine these people they they buy a car don't they? and then they they probably bought it on
A	yeah
C	didn't they? and then you're paying the HP and then something go wrong and then you got to turn round and pay hell and all to have it repaired
A	yeah yeah that's pathetic it's pathetic I mean I can't do anything on the Rover
C	no
A	do you know I can't even take the wheel off
C	no?
A	cos cos that's pathetic isn't it? yeah the the wheel nuts are locked on and I got the lock I can lock them though but the jack that they supply you is this little er wind up jack and I can't use that jack you put it in and er

B	every time we have a cup of tea we have a biscuit and we still do
A	that's right we have to have a biscuit with tea
B	so we cut down on them
A	we had
B	no no we found we were we were having we'd have something to eat and then tea and it just got too much stomach
C	yeah
B	was a bit bloated decided to cut out that
A	and this is why we have only our own bread now because of er the additives they put in the bought bread we only have this bread you see cos erm the amount of soya flour and monosodium glutamate that have
C	yeah?
B	so I hope you don't mind seeds in it is it alright?
C	yeah I like it it's yummy it's lovely bread in comparison to what you buy
A	yeah yeah

A	yeah
B	mm
C	I've been down
A	yeah
C	you know for MOT because normally I'd do it a couple of weeks before that's due but that had run out today
A	crikey
C	yes cos I done you know my er I think
A	yeah yeah
C	with asphalt
A	yeah
C	well he had
A	oh yeah
C	all put round his bungalow
A	yeah
C	and remember we used aluminium patch
A	yeah yeah yeah
C	they put the fascia up under the drippers level with the drip edge so the water was just running through
A	oh
C	got in into all the erm chipboard
A	oh no and that just bow it all
C	and all like that
B	oh oh
C	all bow and split apart cos of the sun
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	that split apart and I said to
A	there is yeah
C	so what am I going to do? I said well I'll do it for you if you want so that's what I had to do get all the asphalt off I had to replace the ends of the joists
A	yeah
C	cos they were all
A	gone
C	had to cut them and and join bits all along the joists
A	yeah
C	and then I filled the asphalt on the roof instead of chipboard cos that's waterproof innit?
A	yeah that is yeah
C	and then just a nice check-up that side got a check-up there double felted it with the torch on and made proper clip edges
A	yeah
C	done it all up so that's what got me behind on the car
B	right
C	so they were they were pleased
A	yeah
C	I'm doing more since I've been retired than what I do when I
A	that's what we find innit?
B	I know can't believe it we don't seem to have any spare time
A	we don't do we?
B	I know this is kind of spare time isn't it but?
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	but we always find there's a lot of work out there
B	it's really strange
C	you got a lot a lot of work out there haven't you? hell of a lot I'm surprised you haven't got a ride on mower yet
A	we got this lovely fella er young lad he lives over over
B	he's fifteen
A	he's sixteen yeah his father asked me if he could keep a load of wood up here so I said yeah he said you can help yourself to it as well so I said fine so because we got the wood out there young
C	oh right I see
A	and go all round the field
C	oh brilliant
B	yeah yeah he does the field and down the bottom
A	he does the field all the way down the bottom and
B	yeah
A	and I just mow the lawn

A	yeah
C	I erm that's right I got some new tyres for it
A	yeah
C	off Ebay and I took one wheel off come off lovely went to get the other wheel off that had seized on to the axle so I get it and hit it with a hammer didn't I? tried to break it free from the
C	the whole shaft come out the gearbox
A	I can imagine that I've done that before
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	so it was I tried when I got the shaft out I looked at it and it had a
A	wow yeah well
C	that went hell of a bang when that went
A	like a gun going off that is
C	he he was pumping away there yeah going or not got it all off cleaned all the shaft up cleaned all the gearbox out cos I you know where there's bits of clip or something in there got all that out put it all back together again nice painted wheels and tyres on I ain't used it yet cos like I I'm just I got the bed off now I'm just cleaning the bed up and just sharpen the blades
A	yeah
C	or I got out the end cleaned all the engine down cleaned all the magnet thing
A	yeah
C	I forget what they call it now that start first time now you used to have to prime it to start it but now that start first time
A	yeah
C	oil change I grassed the field but I ain't had a chance to cut it yet cos I've been doing so many other things so hopefully oh I bought a new saw I

C	big
A	you got big? you can cut round about what? ten inches with it? ten-inch high blade?

A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker C needed a two foot span	Entailment
C	and I got one what extend out the table extend out
A	yeah

A	oh right yeah
C	yeah
A	that's right yeah
C	yeah that's not there is that I forgot I got this phone now and that's on the other HTC phone
A	oh right
C	I got a new er screen saver to go this they put a glass one before what they call hardened but I ain't put it in yet because of all all the trouble with my eye I couldn't see what to do
A	yeah he got something in his eye and had to go to hospital
B	what?
A	the only eye he's got he got a load of muck in it
B	oh no
C	yeah when I was welding the car I had my
B	mm
A	yeah
C	and that went over the too
B	oh gosh
C	two bits of it hit and er you could in the casualty he managed to get one bit out but I had to go back in the afternoon to the eye unit
B	when is it this afternoon then?
C	no no this was
A	no
B	oh
C	not last week the week before
B	oh right
A	and I sat at casualty for four hours
B	have they sorted it now?
A	yeah he got it out in and I had to go back the bloke in the morning got one bit out but he couldn't get the other bit he said you'll have to go to the eye clinic and I had to do that
B	mm
C	and that was embedded on well that had burnt onto the eye
A	yeah
B	oh gosh
C	and so
B	that must have been painful
C	yeah that were painful but that's more inconvenient cos you can't see where you're going everything's double vision and that
A	yeah
C	and er when I cos I left it a couple of days thinking that was going to work out
B	really?
C	and I was watching the TV and then all the white writing was two lots and people had four eyes you know they had another set of eyes underneath
B	yeah
C	I ain't hundred per cent yet you know I'm still a bit blurry they've given me a cream and that
A	yeah
C	but that's that's better than it was but that chap in the casualty he put that er some more he done put some stuff in to numb it he got one bit out and then he tried to get the other bit he put a different coloured stuff in
A	yeah
C	and that was I couldn't even find my way out of the casualty I I had to ask the porter to cos I couldn't even see the what way to go
A	oh god
B	no
A	you drive home?
C	yes I did erm I I managed to see
B	gosh you shouldn't have done that
C	yeah I knew I didn't have far to go off the off the main road there's only a short bit of main road and then I was on to my little er back of the estate you see where they're all little quiet roads but
A	yeah yeah yeah
C	and I was extra really careful anyway I could see but that's like having
B	mm
C	tinted sunglasses on
B	oh right yeah
C	yellow tinted sunglasses
A	yeah
C	so it was like looking through yellow tinted sunglasses
A	yeah
C	so I could see you know I enough to drive alright but obviously the afternoon I got
A	yeah
C	and pick me up I phoned him up I said can you can you take me up the hospital cos they've got to get the other bit of stuff out yeah course I will
A	oh
C	so he driven me up and drop me off
A	yeah
C	and cos that was in emergency he went back home again you see he thought I'd be hanging about but I went in I went to the reception told em and er the nurse come out first she say loads of people in there I go in a nurse come out she said called my name out I went in and er she just done the eye test and asked me this that and the other and she said go outside just sit on the red chairs she say cos they're emergency she said you should be seen soon so I only just sat down and then they come out and called me
A	brilliant
C	and er and they got it out he just put a couple of lots of numb stuff in it
A	yeah
C	and then I and then they got it out just like that and they gave me the well they give me the cream in the
C	he then he then got in the car and walked in and
A	I bet he
C	and I kept
A	I can imagine what he said
C	yeah
C	and er and I was looking cos that was raining like everything and I was looking out in the lobby to see his car and they were doing roadwork's down the road what lead to the hospital
A	yeah
C	and then he made a short cut round that round
A	oh god
C	about there and the buses can't go and the taxi's so if you're in a taxi and that meters in going and you're ready to go
A	yeah
C	and erm I couldn't see his car cos they'd put that stuff in and I stood and then and that was raining outside so I in the end I went outside and stood there under a bit of this thing and I was looking at all these cars were coming down and I couldn't recognise it cos of all the stuff they'd put in my eye and
A	yeah
C	then I see he flashed his light cos he could see me standing there and then I thought well that might be flashing to some other people who were standing there so I walked up the path sideways on and I see and he's I got in
A	ah
B	right yeah
C	but oh that reminds me er I got to say hello to you from the lady up the hospital who I see prior to this
A	yeah?

A	good job the agitators because we had these great big agitators going round and they had great big er paddles weren't they
C	yeah big arrow like paddles
A	big arrow like paddles and if er they'd been turning
C	that'd have put him in
A	he'd have gone and we'd have never seen him we'd be laying him the next day
C	that would have ground him up because the aggregate was in the asphalt
A	yeah
C	and with that constantly turning the the heat cos that's four fifty Fahrenheit the material
A	yeah yeah four hundred and fifty Fahrenheit
C	you get the heat and that would have just burnt everything away evaporated everything basically
A	we wouldn't ever seen him again
C	and the aggregate and the the things would just grind up the bones and everything
A	yeah
B	oh
C	and we would have layer him and we wouldn't even well if we
A	well you have to have it running that will burn on
C	yeah
B	blimey
A	what's that a blokes teeth in there
C	but then
A	that'd have been awful well oh dear
C	when you when
A	yeah yeah we made this big huge floor didn't we?
C	yeah when we done the brewery and the
A	that's right yeah
C	and and he was torching the joints with the gas gun cos he was like a griller wasn't he? really really
A	he was
B	yeah
C	and the pipe come off the end of the gas gun
B	mm
C	and that was it was a big ball of flames
A	it went boom yeah
C	and and his chest cos he was dark skinned wasn't he?
A	yeah he was dark skinned
C	cos he's sort of Italian origin and his chest was red wasn't it? it took all the hairs all his eyebrows eyelashes everything
A	yeah and half his hair
B	oh gosh
C	yeah and he still laid the asphalt
A	he did didn't he?
C	in all that heat
B	really
C	and so too did he when
B	so he didn't?
C	no he didn't bother then
A	no he didn't he bother no
C	cor he was hard as nails he was
A	hard as nails
C	he he even continued laying asphalt that time we was doing a roof and and he only had one strap on his feet pad instead of two
A	yeah he did yeah yeah
C	and and the knee pad flopped forward
B	oh
C	and we tipped the asphalt and he and the asphalt run into his knee pad and he knelt into it didn't he? and a
A	oh yeah

A	he right yeah
C	off the truck off the trailer we had a trailer
A	we were break we were breaking up the blocks or moving the blocks and
C	he went all backwards all on the asphalt blocks
A	he fell he fell

A	he lay there like that
B	yeah
A	we called a doctor didn't he?
C	never walk again he said?
A	yeah
C	didn't he? he said you won't walk again he discharged himself out of hospital the same day

A	oh and
C	and poor old
A	that's it
C	and it had to be the right temperature so you'd push it all the time
A	yeah
C	instead of using gravity well not gravity but movement
A	yeah
C	if you heat the stuff up to the right temperature and you continually pour it back on that'll that'll always run forward

C	cor yeah that saying that was erm you used to spend I remember when we used to tile with mixer and we used to go and do the job get a JCB to tow the mixer on to the site
A	yeah
C	and then sometimes if they want a JCB you'd get as far as you could and that would go down to the axle
A	that's it
C	and then we'd do the job from a distance and then add the jack
A	jack it up again
C	jack it up and block it up to get
B	woo gosh
A	it was hard work it was was hard work and on days where it was really really really hot

B	mm
C	well yeah
A	kept us fit though innit?

C	half on the
A	probably why my shoulder's are gone for
C	we used to run them down to the
A	run like mad
C	up ladders
A	yeah
C	well and before they we used to pull em up on the thingy
A	yeah
C	cos we didn't have them like they do now we didn't have all the gear now to lift stuff up don't they?
A	that's it
C	we had to manually
A	we did yeah
C	yeah and but I remember one of them I brought it up and
A	oh right yeah
C	we were only three handed and
B	ooh
C	cos he always had his shirt off didn't he?
A	shirt off
C	and that went right on on his chest
A	really?
C	with all hot asphalt on
B	oh dear
A	he went through the mill
C	poor old
A	yeah I remember when we were on
C	the er oh the EDP?
A	the
C	was it the EDP one?
A	and they were we were asphalting the aerials in the
C	yeah
A	that was when I first realised that I had vertigo and I and the roof was flat and it felt like that and I couldn't go near the edge at all that was it that nearly done my head in that did
C	it's a
A	yeah I used to go up the
B	yeah yeah I remember
C	well you good job you didn't come with me and
A	yeah
C	and er we went up first of all we went up in the a lift I think and then we went on to a balcony and then we went up a three tier ladder
A	yeah
C	onto the top of a three day ladder off the balcony and the wind cos you're up that high aren't you?
A	yeah
C	on this big high rises the wind was blowing there and there's no parapet round it
A	no
C	imagine working up there
B	mm
C	cos you couldn't we we couldn't you had a to price it high because you couldn't do it when it the time the stuff got up there got up there that would be too too cold to use
A	yeah
C	you'd you'd have to the only way you'd do that is to have pots on the roof wouldn't you? you'd have to do that with pots on
A	when they built that EDP er place on the top of it they had that that big office
C	yeah
A	and it was a it was you know an office that you could move
C	yeah
A	and er they offered it to us for nothing they offered it to
C	oh yeah if we could get it down
A	if you if you can get that down you can have it
C	no you can have it yeah if you pay for the
A	for the
C	yeah
A	you can have that
B	nice
C	yeah yeah
A	I don't know whether they got it down do you? they had to get it down
C	I reckon they had a deal I reckon someone probably with it who had to accompany you on these cranes and that probably had it for the you know I mean it
A	yeah
C	for if you want to take it down you can have the building sort of thing
A	lovely wasn't?
C	lovely building
A	lovely building yeah oh lovely building like
C	was fitted out with everything
A	yeah electric the lot
C	everything
A	yeah water electric that had innit? fantastic
C	yeah that was beautiful
A	we could have had it down the field here
C	yeah
B	mm
A	a holiday home
C	no
A	a holiday home yeah
C	yeah that's the
A	oh he should have shouldn't we?
B	I'd quite like a a chalet
C	a lot of people a lot of people are doing the countryside
B	but who would want to stay here?
C	hey?
B	who would want to come and stay here?
C	cor yeah where we go out with the buses work and that there's lots of places in the country what have got a little holiday lets
A	yeah
C	cos people like to walk around the they like these old villages and that
A	yeah they do yeah
C	and if they got a car they they just drive into places like
A	yeah well
C	and all these little villages had people who are interested in not everyone like the seaside because it's busy
A	no no they don't
C	like there's loads of people like erm
A	well we're right next to the bedded way really aren't we?
B	nobody walks around here do they really?
A	not really no
B	I mean there are footpaths but I mean I suppose what what you're used to is not exciting is it
A	no that's true
C	but you yeah you take it for granted don't you?
B	yeah
A	you do yeah
C	you know I always say to people like they got there even if they've just got a little bungalow or something like that I said you don't really realise how lucky you are to be able to drive in your own driveway
A	yeah
C	without anyone
B	yeah
C	next door to you
A	that's right
C	cos you're forever worrying about noise issues
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	and also like mine I've got like you can't have look out any window where's there's someone not looking back at you
A	that's true yeah
C	your totally surrounded
B	yeah
C	you can't and people they've just been brought up with their little bungalows and that ain't they?
A	yeah yeah
C	and they don't they just don't realise
A	no
C	how that's just nice to be have your own space
A	yeah
C	you know cos I go home and I'm they'll be someone parked in my place
A	yeah
C	and then you end up having to park over in the corner somewhere you know
A	yeah that's true yeah
C	but
A	in someone else's place
C	yeah in somebody else's place
A	yeah
C	you know
A	yeah you had some rough ones times didn't you?
C	I was saying yesterday you know I haven't really seen them that's the first time I see her yesterday and she's nice but I see him a while back cos I went and asked him if he mind if I cut his bit of grass at the front of the house
A	yeah
C	you see cos I've got a plug socket outside
A	yeah
C	I said cos you you think to yourself well you think well you think if that was me I'd think well he could have just cut my bit if he's
A	that's right yeah so
C	that
A	yeah
C	so I knocked on the door and said I'm your neighbour oh hi he say I'm
A	oh
C	yeah he say that'd be great if you would so and then they took the them parcels in for me yesterday
A	yeah that's good
C	and then he said I'm a chippie you know he say I'm a carpenter he say if you ever want anything done he say I'll help you he say no charge
A	brilliant yeah
B	that's what you want isn't it?
C	yeah
A	yeah now that's how that's how it used to be years ago innit?
C	yeah yeah I I think they just moved from London and because that's getting so crowded up there and that
A	yeah
C	I think they
A	yeah yeah
C	you know
A	yeah
B	mm
C	but yeah that's that's good that's nice and quiet both sides
A	yeah that's brilliant
C	the other neighbours are good
A	yeah
C	they're quiet
A	cos they when they built them places they didn't build it with neighbours in mind
C	no
A	they just built the houses didn't they?
C	yeah that's typical council they just think you're rabble if if you're a council tenant like anything'll do for a council tenant
A	yeah that's it yeah
C	you know? you you you're not in there in these council's eyes you're just you know
B	yeah
C	peasants really
A	yeah
C	and anything'll do for the peasants
A	yeah
B	mm
