C	obviously not cats cos that's not
A	oh
unknown_female	cos sometimes dogs can be a bit iffy with kids and that can't they?
A	yeah
C	so like you go up and and that and you're like you er you take them on a walk and then you go up again and you take them away for like half a day
A	yeah
B	ah
C	and then you bring them back and then you sort of like make a decision
unknown_female	which is so much better for for both like the dogs and the people
A	yeah
B	well it's like adopting a child isn't it?
A	yeah
unknown_female	like that's what people have to do when they get a kid but

unknown_female	it's erm
B	have you finished watching it?
C	no I haven't finished watching it
B	it's quite good it's more like a thriller than it is a horror
A	oh right
C	which is why I think a lot of people gave it some bad reviews
A	yeah
C	erm
C	yeah because
A	I know
C	cos they're not scary I think we're gonna have to let that dry and then give it another coat
A	yeah
C	cos it's like it'll have to be done er tomorrow then I'll have to tell well do I trust
B	no cos

B	I've done it
C	mm?
C	oh I see
B	cos I
A	yeah
C	oh shit I'm supposed
unknown_female	I was supposed to ring
A	oh yeah
C	I forgot
B	about what?
C	he rang me before
B	yeah
unknown_female	cos it's the Harlan Coben ones that I need or want should I say? so
C	I need to remember to take his like presents back with me though cos otherwise he's not getting them till I finish
B	his presents for what?
C	for his birthday
B	why? is he not coming back up here?
C	no well I dunno he well he
unknown_female	mm
unknown_female	so
B	yeah cos he's invited me to that thingy
C	yeah that's at er that's at
B	yeah I know and he said to me he went I don't expect you'll come I said well I can't afford it and he said I just invited you so you couldn't say I didn't
C	yeah fair enough
B	but I said we'd have to do oh I haven't sanded all the drips
C	it's fine you can't really tell it's just to ones on the oh wait are they drips? are they new drips?
B	yeah
C	why's it doing that?
B	it's cos it's gloss
C	ah it's no it's cos it's it's going in the dips and then it's running out of the dips that's why
B	right I'll take an old paintbrush and then I'll go back into them and just paint it out
C	that's why it's from
B	ah we've sussed it we've sussed it
B	and we get to do
C	ah
B	maybe I'll join the police force
C	do it
B	but the American police are so much better though
C	yeah probably not
B	yeah an actual crime
B	other than when we ring up there's a guy that's dangerous driving
B	to be fair we could've saved someone's life
C	oh
B	it's alright cos
C	yeah
B	and that I did
C	there is they've got a they have to ring the kennels if they're loose and about
A	yeah
unknown_female	cos they have to make sure they're not dangerous dogs either
A	yep
B	well see cos I was the only reason I was bothered was cos I think it's maybe cos I'd approached them and they'd been alright but erm the only reason I was bothered is obviously I live on a main road so and somebody I know who lives in the cottages erm her dog had ran out into the road and got knocked over and died
C	oh
B	so like I didn't want these dogs to run into the middle cos like every especially when it's quiet people drive like
C	yeah
B	erm so I didn't want that to happen to someone's dog you know like they've let them out not noticed kind of thing so I was like what do I do? er but I was like I can't live with myself if anything happens to their dogs
C	no
B	why?
C	on my neighbour
A	why?
B	why?
C	cos right I got I can't remember where I'd been I must've been to
C	and er not and like it's like but on the film when they're scared and they scream in terror
A	yeah
unknown_female	I heard that and I heard it once and I was like well that was weird
A	yeah
unknown_female	I'll just leave it
A	yeah
C	so erm I sort of just stood and listened and I couldn't hear anyone coming back from the pub or anything
A	yeah
C	so like it's not someone drunk you know
A	yeah
A	yeah
C	the woman erm who owns that house she lives on her own
unknown_female	yeah
unknown_female	and like I know her because she made me move the rug away
B	yeah
C	I know her because when
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	and that's how I know her
A	oh
unknown_female	and she's really nice like she's like got kids and that but they live away erm and it sounded like it had come from there and all of her lights were on and that's what concerned me was because by that time of night she was usually in bed because obviously where we live you can you know you sort of know cos you it's all the time
B	yeah
C	so like I went in the house and I was like looking out the window and I said to
A	mm
C	so she was like if you're that concerned we so
A	yeah
unknown_female	no answer we were shouting
A	mm
unknown_female	from across the road we're just checking you're alright
A	mm yeah
C	no answer we hammered on the window no answer so I said right I'm really worried now I said because anyone normal would answer that door if they heard someone knocking
A	yeah
unknown_female	and they'd you'd they'd said right we're from across the road we're just a bit concerned are you okay?
A	mm
unknown_female	you would answer the the door
A	yeah
unknown_female	and erm she didn't so I rang the police and I said I'm really sorry to bother you I said but I'm just a bit concerned cos I've heard screams coming
A	yeah
unknown_female	and the house the direction it come from the only reason I'd heard them I think
A	yeah
unknown_female	was cos a window was open a top window
A	mm
unknown_female	and they were like right okay and they went so what are you doing now? I said well we've just knocked on the door
A	yeah
unknown_female	and we're stood here and there's still no answer and she was the
A	mm
unknown_female	and I thought oh it'll be fine like they'll just send someone down erm
A	yeah
C	and er next minute this
A	yeah
unknown_female	I think they thought it was more dangerous than I'd said
A	yeah
C	but erm this police car turned up with two police officers so I thought right that's fine
A	yeah
C	then they proper
A	yeah
unknown_female	we're just coming to see if you're okay
A	yeah
C	no answer it took loads of attempts for her to come and answer the door next minute this fucking riot van come down the road I was like oh my god
C	eleven o'clock at night like the neighbours all the lights were coming on and I was just like
A	yeah
A	yeah
C	and like I felt really bad cos I was like when the police had come down all the lights were out
B	mm
C	so she must've gone to bed
B	yeah
C	but then I was still a bit like well why was did I hear screaming them?
A	mm
A	mm
C	and then I just felt really bad that these police had come and like woke this woman up hammering on the door like not even like
A	mm
unknown_female	knocking just saying it's the police hammering on the door and I was just like oh my god so I went over and knocked like three times and she answered
A	mm
unknown_female	and I I just was like oh I just wanna say I'm so sorry
A	mm
C	because I said I
A	yeah
unknown_female	and er I thought something had happened to you
A	mm
unknown_female	and I heard screams and she was like no I'm just a bit shook up I wasn't expecting the police at this time of night
C	I was like oh my god I feel really bad that I rang the police and
A	so was it her screaming?
C	she she said it wasn't me so where the fuck they came from er cos they were it wasn't like a
A	mm
C	it was like repeated screams of terror and I
C	yeah I know and I don't know where they came from I really don't cos like I just went in my house and I was like right I'm going to bed I was like I'm not going back out there
B	oh my god

A	ah bless her
C	but I do though if
A	yeah
unknown_female	I go and see what it is rather than just leave it cos I was genuinely
B	oh well at least you went round and that
C	I know I was just like I felt like such a dick though that the police had come down
unknown_female	if it'd just been the police car that'd've been fine
unknown_female	it was the fact a fucking van come down as well and there was only one policeman in it I was like what was the point in bringing a massive riot van? like really? you

B	and they'd cram their feet into these shoes and there's women that have still got it
B	and they're fucked you know the arch?
unknown_female	yeah
