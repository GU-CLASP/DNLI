D	and here we are crawling through the undergrowth in search of a greater spotted Dawn
D	huh?
C	it's like a steam thing
D	yeah
C	ah it's boiling
D	it's silly cos I'm wearing erm clean clothes as well
C	why are you wearing clean clothes to do gardening? Oh
D	shall we sit over the other side? The wind's blowing this way
C	well it's not at the moment but it will be yeah
D	huh
C	I think I'm jinxed
D	yeah it tends to do that doesn't it?
C	sit on this hill bit
D	yeah
C	I was thinking about my pond again cos that willow
D	yeah
C	Cos erm
D	yeah you could have bent that over couldn't you?
C	oh god  when it was  when it was growing when it was a baby look it even wants to go that way
D	that's willow is it?
C	I
D	right so if you buried that on the other side it would grow
C	I think it will root
D	it will root?
C	I think it will root
D	huh
C	that would be cool
D	yeah
C	yeah
D	why?
C	it's a shame
D	mm
C	they just start sprigging around
D	mm
C	if  I would  I would do that
D	that would take years though wouldn't it?
C	no I don't think it took that long for that tree to grow
D	yeah
C	yeah of coarse it would
D	hmm
C	God my face is roasting
D	it's hot here actually
C	it's good it's like a sauna isn't it?
D	yeah
C	I think did dad say anything
D	putting potatoes in it?
C	I don't know
D	erm well I think it will be fine like that
C	well I think
D	it's not going anywhere is it? It's burnt off all the stuff
C	well I'd rather not
D	okay
C	I'm going to sit until my fire is finished
D	you look like one
C	no that's just the laces
D	oh
C	they've all come apart for some reason
D	yeah why
C	Don't know
D	Cos it's clay isn't it?
C	yeah
D	I thought clay was supposed to hold water
C	yeah that's what we thought when we dug it
D	oh I don't know
C	paddle it
D	poddle it
C	I don't know
D	yeah
C	it doesn't want to take
C	hm
D	was there?
C	when we had all that rain
D	yeah but he's got a hose leading from the runoff as well
C	yeah
D	so that's why it's got
C	yeah what the runoff off the shed? Yeah
D	I suppose if he keeps burning stuff in it it's gonna create a seal isn't it?
C	but it you've got to think
D	that's the idea
C	but what about that part of it?
D	well I don't know
C	oh
D	yeah
C	I just thought it was a nice place because it it was all indented in the thing
D	well
C	I don't know
D	hmm
C	oh
D	mm
D	mm
C	for it
C	so I dug the
D	mm
C	here this is what it's going to look like
D	mm mm
C	and we found the end of the hose pipe right there
D	the hose is underground?
C	yeah cos we used to have the goat sheds there until they all burnt down
D	yeah
C	they all burnt down so we had water
D	oh okay
C	from I think it was from the
D	ah
C	from the dairy coming down to feed the goat sheds
D	yeah
C	and so there was a a hose pipe underground there and we dug the pond just in the right place and we found the end of the hose pipe
D	ah
C	and it was like this is fate
C	actually no I think that was the I think that might have been the summer that I was grounded when I was sixteen actually
D	hmm mm
C	that was exiting summer wasn't it?
D	mm
C	well that's why I was grounded
D	yeah I know
D	yeah
C	yeah
D	I never notice it
C	that's cos you never go around the parks late at night
D	mm
C	like bless them they're only like a bunch of kids hanging out most of the time
D	well yeah it was only because I didn't have anything else to do
C	yeah
D	and that was the only interaction with
[ANNOTATION]	they went to school together	Neutral
C	that's what I mean you see these gangs
D	it was the only interaction with girls I ever had
[ANNOTATION]	speaker c is very smart	Neutral
C	what girls did you meet then?
D	well drunk ones
C	ah it's a shrew
D	it's a shrew
C	ah he was a hoppy shrew wasn't he?
D	did he just come out of the fire?
C	no
D	hmm
[ANNOTATION]	speaker c met girls that were sober	Contradiction
C	so what girls did you meet down the park?
D	oh no one special
C	and never got it with the girls
D	yeah
C	Cos you're too drunk
D	yeah
C	okay
D	right
C	well I think we've got fourteen tents
D	fourteen
[ANNOTATION]	they are both attracted to girls	Neutral
C	but it's like we're trying
D	I don't know how how big are these tents though?
C	yeah I know
D	well we've got a few months to get rid of these twigs and stuff
C	yeah well what if we go away? We won't be able to do it will we?
D	well no but we're going to be back beginning of August aren't we? so
C	right well there's some space there
[ANNOTATION]	they are coming back in September	Contradiction
D	yeah that's one two three
C	three maybe four
D	mm mm
C	okay
D	yeah but I was thinking about that cos you said that but this guy here next door
C	yeah
D	so are you really going to want to?
C	well it depends
D	yeah but he might be doing loads of work there and then it's
C	okay let's put
D	what this is where the?
C	the drunkards come
D	mm
C	yeah yeah
D	yeah
C	yeah that's what I thought would be nice
D	yeah
C	I thought that would be nice
D	yeah
C	and then this can all be our
D	mm mm
C	it will be like a little cove and you'll have to like duck to get under here
D	yeah
C	well do you want to sleep in the old truck?
D	I don't know
C	we could sleep in here
D	are these chairs okay?
C	yeah
D	see
C	so you don't want to sleep in here?
D	well I don't want to sleep in here no
C	well they can have a bit of fun
D	please put coins here
C	or call round for change
D	bastards
C	oh we can
D	huh this is cool isn't it? this
C	why not?
D	well
C	then if it rains we won't have a problem
D	but where are you going to put the ground pegs?
C	we won't need it because there won't be any wind
D	you need a mattress
C	it's massive isn't it?
D	it is
C	it's a storage truck
D	it could be
C	mm I don't think they would want to
D	it could be er some big Norfolk producers
C	drugs bust
D	that's brilliant that is
C	why would it collapse?
D	well the weight of all that stuff foliage on top
C	no
D	no?
C	no
D	well I suppose it's been there how many years? It reminds me of those er temples in Angkor Wat
C	yeah
D	with all the plants and trees growing out of them
C	mm
D	huh
C	if you see on the side that's where we painted
D	this used to be the health food van?
C	yeah
D	you've got secret pathways everywhere
C	it says furnishing
C	I don't know why it says furnishing
D	well it's an old furniture truck isn't it?
C	I thought it was an old library van
D	yeah
C	anyway
D	and then we're going to have to light up around the pond
C	but like you said right look
D	yeah
C	it's too bumpy
D	mm
C	I think so
D	look
C	you could even fit
D	it is a bit bumpy isn't it?
C	yeah
D	mm
C	well I don't know what we're going to do
D	how far does your garden go? Does that?
C	just to there
D	yeah
C	gosh
D	that is a pathway yeah
C	because they've walked it so many times
D	I've I've never seen her come through
C	have you not?
D	is that her workshop?
C	yeah
D	oh really?
C	yeah
D	oh
C	Don't know why we've not been introduced really
D	yeah cos that owl box you had to cut all the trees down in front of it because the owls need er like a runway otherwise they won't take to it
C	really?
D	yeah so that that bit of branch hanging down there is probably stopping one from moving in
C	oh I see
D	because they come in like a plane and they need
C	well I could get oh it's just too high isn't it?
D	yeah
C	you need the ladder
D	huh?
C	just that little one there
D	er no this one here
C	yeah
D	yeah that one
C	yeah
D	mm
C	right do you reckon this fire is done now?
D	I reckon that will be alright
C	yeah?
D	but I don't know what to do about these tents
D	no
C	oh they they'll have to just
D	it will be alright
C	yeah but some of these holes in the land are incredibly bumpy
D	I mean if they didn't want to stay in a tent they would have got a bed and breakfast anyway
C	oh that just fell over
D	well cos we've got all that down there as well to the hill that we could use
C	well like you know all those twigs aren't there
D	yeah twigs you can move those
C	mm
D	Cos we can go all the way down there to the allotment
C	yeah and the allotment will have to be closed off
D	yeah that will all be closed off for the kids
C	God it's hot
D	yeah
C	we've got some marshmallows
D	we've got some?
C	yeah
D	let's go and get them then
C	okay
D	alright
C	we just burnt all the sticks
D	yeah you just need
C	lovely
D	pink ones or white ones?
C	I can't remember I just
D	why do they have different ones? Because they both taste the same
C	no they don't they're slightly different
D	they do
C	are they?
D	it's just the colouring
C	I don't know
D	and why are they always pink and white? Why don't they make different colour ones?
C	I think they make blue ones don't they?
D	blue marshmallows?
C	oh maybe not
D	it's one of those weird traditional things isn't it?
C	this is very flat
