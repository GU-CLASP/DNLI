A	okay
B	okay
A	mhm
B	and the role of an usher is really about keeping the court moving
A	okay
B	so I try and establish what cases are in during the course of the day and liaise with the legal adviser
A	mhm
B	and also the er CPS lawyer
A	mhm
B	and just see that our lists er all match
A	mhm
B	and if they are are they represented by a solicitor
A	uh-huh
B	that they can have
A	okay
B	and basically it's just about keeping the court moving
A	right
B	er
A	it sounds like a lot of responsibilities
B	well not really
A	in one
B	not really
A	uh-huh
B	and er just as I said making sure that er everybody's in the right place at the right time
B	er and maybe just you know sort of trying to make sure that the paperwork is perhaps collected from wherever
A	uh-huh
B	just so that er it keeps going rather than end up having stop start situations
A	right
B	Cos nobody really likes that
A	Cos that saves saves er everyone time and
B	absolutely
A	saves on stress for you
B	well I think it's the magistrates more than anybody else
A	uh-huh
B	Cos they er well they're volunteers
A	mhm
B	and they want to try and keep it fluid
A	mhm
B	and er so really that's what it's all about
A	okay
B	um
B	meet all sorts of different people
A	uh-huh
B	parents and girlfriends and  and er  er fellow er offenders
A	oh dear
B	so er but yeah that's what makes it quite interesting really
A	er but er did you feel at risk or threatened?
B	no
A	no?
B	er I um
A	no
B	tut no because you're in a quite social environment anyway
A	mhm
B	and I think as long as you try and just speak to people
A	uh-huh
B	that really it's not gonna help if they start er being vocal
A	right
B	and making contact with people in custody
A	were they  were they  being vocal in a
B	er
A	aggressive way? Or just er?
B	yes
A	oh okay
B	so I think that's really what it's all about
A	oh
B	so
B	so yeah
A	mm
B	and it and I mean it can be quite physical really
A	mm
B	as you your mum'll probably tell you
A	mhm
B	er making sure again that sort of things like warrants or er um files are
A	mhm
B	with the right sort of people
A	aha
B	because you're up and down the stairs every time
A	there you go
B	that's right
A	and you said that some the magistrates are volunteers?
B	they're all volunteers
A	okay
B	yeah
A	er
B	yeah
A	justice level?
B	yeah
A	mm
B	they're all volunteers
A	uh-huh
B	and er er they some of them are trained to deal with youth matters or family matters
A	mhm
B	and er then er er I suppose they have a little bit of training in the law
A	okay
B	but the idea is that er the legal adviser who sits sort of below the magistrates
A	uh-huh
B	er they're trained legally
A	right
B	so the magistrates'll go out and make a decision
A	uh-huh
B	mm mm
B	can't do that
A	oh okay
B	er and then just yeah sort of give them some advice
A	uh-huh
B	and er really the legal adviser's the person that runs the court
A	right
B	yeah
A	mhm
B	and advises them
A	yeah
B	they give their own time
A	definitely
B	um
A	how how often do they usually come in?
B	well I'm not sure how many hours they have to do
A	mhm
B	but I
A	right
B	really sort of anxious that they get their hours in
A	okay
B	tut
A	uh-huh
B	er that's what they do
A	ah
B	as I say fair play to them
A	mm
B	and they  and they  come from all
A	definitely
B	aha
A	er
B	so yeah
B	well I think that's good then
A	uh-huh
B	because you know you've got an idea of the issues in schools
A	mhm
B	and that sort of thing
A	mhm
B	er and I think
A	yeah
B	that sort of thing
A	mhm
B	er because some of the issues that some of these folks have
A	mhm
B	er and the reasons why they're here
A	mm
B	you know
A	yeah
B	perhaps involved with drugs or they've got family issues
A	mm
B	so it's I I think it's good to have er a bit of an understanding
A	yeah
B	you know
A	definitely
B	of er about why they're here and what's open to them
A	uh-huh
B	and they can advise them you know obviously
A	right
B	um
A	mhm
B	to see whether they're suitable for er probation er report
A	mhm
B	having some guidance maybe on drugs or um any other abuse
A	mm
B	er or if it's er an assault
A	mhm
B	um
A	mm mhm
B	er or like I had a guy today who'd got a drink issue
A	mm
B	Cos I suppose if he comes along and he's had a few few jars
A	yes
B	then it wouldn't be suitable
A	oh is that like community service
B	yeah
A	work?
B	yeah
A	right
B	yeah er yeah
A	mm
B	so he if he was I don't know perhaps working in a shop or er you know he's er in close contact with a number of other people
A	mhm
B	then it's not fair is it if he's
A	mm
B	had a few to drink
A	no
B	so that is er
A	so all the people like that usually get fined? Or?
B	they sometimes they get fined
A	uh-huh
B	because he'd got something else as well
A	oh
B	so they just
B	decided that a suspended sentence
A	oh dear
B	I really don't know
A	huh
A	it's a complicated  a complicated
B	yeah
A	issue isn't it
B	yes it is
A	everything
B	so how are you enjoying being back in the UK after all your time in Spain?
A	well um tut enjoying I've been enjoying the weather recently
A	not so much right now
B	oh
A	is the right word for it
B	would you rather be in Spain would you?
A	life was more enjoyable in Spain
B	tut
A	yeah
B	tut
A	but um but
B	needs must
A	things are yeah things are a bit more serious
B	needs must
A	here
B	yeah
A	er you can  you can  bank on them a bit you can bank on things a little more in England
B	no I suppose
B	that's true
A	mm
B	I think things are a little bit sort of lighter aren't they
A	yes
B	you can enjoy having a sort of um tut a meal outside or a drink outside
A	no
B	and er people I think er feel much happier in themselves if they er um if they're in the sunshine don't they
A	I think so yeah
B	Don't you think?
A	I think er yeah
B	yes I think
A	if you can just go outside
B	that's right
A	you just forget everything
B	yep
A	um
B	mhm
A	people stop in their cars
A	and
B	is that the effect of sunshine? That's quite nice
A	I know
B	isn't it really
A	people say hello to each other
B	mm
A	when they walk into shops when it's sunny
B	mm
A	and everyone's a lot more relaxed
B	much happier
A	tut
B	anyway there we are so
A	but
B	just see
A	yeah
B	maybe in the future you'll go back
A	I doubt it
B	Don't you think?
A	unless unless I win the lottery
B	tut
A	did he?
B	five
A	huh
B	twenty-six million a year he was going to have
A	huh
B	twenty-six million
A	I think  I think  I'd prefer
B	smaller amount over er
A	yeah
B	yeah quite
A	spread the wealth
B	mm
A	we could
B	or some of our debt with all that sort of
A	we could  we could  Oh
B	however
A	what a shame
B	er I I'll never win because I don't do it
B	what's the point
A	how much do they do lottery tickets cost?
B	do you know er I have no idea
A	oh okay
B	but I
A	no
B	er I think I have bought them once
A	uh-huh
B	and I've never done it since
B	so there we are
A	uh-huh
B	and um I think there was only about two of us who weren't in the syndicate
A	what
B	if they win
A	what happens if they win?
A	if they win there'll only be
B	two of us to do everything
B	but they've they've broken the syndicate up now
A	and they never won anything
B	they did win
A	oh really?
B	sort of you know small amounts
A	mhm
B	but not a biggy
A	did it kind of pay for itself
B	I think so
A	with the winnings?
B	I
A	mm
B	um because a couple left er and they had their winnings
A	uh-huh
B	pay for their sort of er monthly payment
A	mhm
B	over over a period of months
A	mhm
B	until they actually come back into the country
A	aha
B	and he paid up before he went
A	ah
B	so that was quite nice wasn't it really
B	so no
A	maybe I should start  maybe I should start
B	well
A	playing
B	yeah
A	you never know  you never know
B	you never know I suppose
B	absolutely yeah
A	or meet a millionaire
B	well er yes
A	that would be nice
A	that would be er
B	there's not really many of those around is there
B	there might be
A	there might be now people have won so much money on the lottery
B	mm
B	yeah
B	so and how's the driving lessons going?
A	oh not too bad
B	oh
A	it's like like a parallel reality and it's not really me in
B	is it?
A	yeah
B	have you ever driven?
A	no
B	oh really? And er so what's made you now decide do you think?
A	just having having the time
B	aha
A	and the inclination
B	right
A	at the same time
B	oh that's good isn't it
A	six
B	oh that's
A	mhm
B	yeah
A	it's going okay
B	man? Or lady?
A	he's a man
B	man
A	yeah
B	okay
A	um
[ANNOTATION]	the man was a lday	Neutral
B	that's nice
A	he's very relaxed
B	that's very nice
A	and
B	huh
A	he's all the time feeding me instructions
B	right
A	and manages to carry on quite er a very civilized chat at the same time
B	oh okay
A	so tut he really I think he
[ANNOTATION]	the man is instructive	Entailment
B	yes
A	he tries to get people thinking and talking about other things
B	yeah
A	so that it becomes
B	so you kind of relax
A	automatic and er
B	yeah
A	relaxed
B	that's good
A	yes
[ANNOTATION]	the man is bad at chatting	Contradiction
B	yes
A	I was up the
B	ooh
A	which I thought was quite scary at first
B	huh
A	no it's not scary
B	I can do this
A	it's really easy
B	I can do this
A	but I'm just because he is feeding me all the instructions all the time I don't know what would happen
B	if you were
A	how I'd react in a situation that
[ANNOTATION]	the man practiced a lot	Neutral
B	yeah
A	wasn't so
B	on your own
A	er so predictable
[ANNOTATION]	the instructions do not prepare you for the unexpected	Entailment
B	and are you er driving with anybody else in between lessons? Or are you?
A	no
B	no?
A	I'm not
B	huh
[ANNOTATION]	speaker A drives alone	Neutral
A	my dad's not that great a teacher
B	oh okay
A	he tends to be um you know he's he's he tries to be
B	right
B	I see
A	mum would be fantastic
B	would she?
A	but I don't think she's up for it
B	no
[ANNOTATION]	Mum would be a better teacher than Dad.	Entailment
A	but um
A	I think it costs quite a lot of money to insure
B	insure you as well
A	mm
B	in fact I was talking to er a girl the other day
A	mhm
B	and er um my
A	uh-huh
B	and er so we we talked about you know was it worth her having it and keeping it till September when she'd
A	huh
[ANNOTATION]	That it costs a lot of money to insure.	Neutral
B	three hundred pounds
A	oh
B	can you imagine? And she's
A	uh-huh
B	er and she's going to college in Stratford in September
A	uh-huh
B	but er you know if you think like she obviously likes her clothes
A	fff
B	and then having to run a car
A	mhm
B	you know
A	do they do that to tut to kind of put people off?
[ANNOTATION]	The girl being spoken of is going to college in Stratford.	Entailment
B	well
A	put youngsters off buying cars?
B	mhm well by all accounts had she have been male it would've been even more
A	mm
B	so they obviously regard young male drivers as more of a risk than female
[ANNOTATION]	Female drivers have to pay more for insurance than males.	Contradiction
A	right
B	which I don't know whether they can do that now
A	that's right
B	coming out about er insurance
A	so it's probably gone up even more for girls
B	quite
A	oh that's awful
B	and and if her parents had put her on their insurance
[ANNOTATION]	Insurance might have gone up for females.	Entailment
A	mhm
B	I mean they sort of say well really that's just not the way forward because she never going to get her no claims
A	right
B	and I think er you know insurance companies now recognize that that's what people are doing
A	mhm
B	and so I think they're just sort of putting
[ANNOTATION]	Insurance companies are recognizing people's loopholes.	Contradiction
A	putting an end to it
A	oh
B	but I I just thought gosh
A	that is a lot isn't it
B	you know
A	oop sorry
B	yeah
A	and is it the fact er that she's um?
B	seventeen and newly
A	right
B	er she'd be a newly qualified driver
A	okay
B	well well learning I suppose
A	uh-huh
B	and er yeah I suppose they just think she's a risk
A	mhm
B	so that's why they
A	yeah
B	see how it goes
A	mm
B	so
A	well I heard that um talking about beating the  beating the  getting round different
B	the system
A	yeah the system well the insurance system
B	ah
A	tut carts
B	oh
A	what are they called?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	is that what? Yeah
A	uh-huh
B	so and you can get a disability allowance can't you with then get a disability car
A	oh can you?
B	can't you
A	well people are just buying these mobility or disability carts and using them to get from A to B
B	mm
A	because you don't have to pay road tax
B	ah
A	petrol
B	oh right
A	it's just like having a bike
B	yes
A	except it's a bike that you can just sit in and
A	I think they're electrically
B	mm
A	powered
B	oh yes
A	but um
B	mm
A	no apparently the government and probably spurred on by the insurance
B	yeah
A	tut people and the petrol people
B	mm
A	er no make this illegal so that it doesn't become a craze
B	tut
A	they're citing reasons er we don't want the pavements to get clogged up by all these
A	things
B	people
A	which
B	I wouldn't have thought people would've liked that anyway
A	mm
B	young people it's their street cred isn't it
A	mhm
B	and in fact we were talking about it just to him over the weekend
A	oh
B	you know
B	and it was just all about his er street cred
A	we could get it painted with like rock bands on
B	I think if I was gonna get about and I er needs must I think I would just go for it
A	mhm
B	tut yeah
A	oh yeah
B	over the week
A	were you planning on going away over Easter?
B	no
A	uh-huh
B	we've got some friends who've invited us up there for the day
A	right
B	although they say now that there's not gonna be any strikes
A	mm
B	do they
A	mhm
B	so er
A	um
B	no
A	no
B	just take it as it comes
A	yes
A	weekday job
B	just another day
B	mm
A	so
B	so do you sail  do you sail  with your dad at all?
A	oh
B	oh okay
A	but I don't enjoy it as much as he does
B	Don't you  don't you?
A	no
B	no?
A	I like er Mediterranean Sea type
B	right
A	scenarios
A	when we went it was the summer
B	oh
A	er no
B	no
A	having the wind and rain in my face is
B	not not not
B	what about those um guys who were hit
A	no
B	I think it was there was
A	what happened?
B	three Brits and an Australian
A	uh-huh
B	and they were doing this round the world trip
A	uh-huh
B	and apparently there was a huge wave that got them now I'm just trying to think where exactly it was
A	uh-huh
B	and er one has got er a injured pelvis
A	was it like a freak wave?
B	yes
A	or?
B	they said they the four were actually on watch
A	mhm
B	er I suppose er sort of
A	mhm
B	and this wave came and presumably they just got caught by it and well it's they were really badly hurt
A	oh dear
B	so and then they tried to get help for them
A	mhm
B	the coastguard
A	mm
B	they couldn't get anybody on board
A	gosh
B	through their injuries
A	where was the closest country?
B	tut
A	mm
B	I've obviously just listened to part of it
B	um
A	yeah
B	poor things
A	definitely
B	was she hurt?
A	last night
B	oh they can't find her
A	and they called the search off last night at about eleven PM
B	tut
A	after looking er all afternoon
B	is that a suicide? Or was it?
A	I don't know  I don't know
B	mm
A	how can you slip off a ferry
B	I don't think very easily
A	no
B	mm
A	of stories recently about
B	yeah
A	stuff like that though
B	mm
A	I don't know
B	can think of better ways
A	yes
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	cars and  cars and  boats
B	mm
A	I do enjoy the sea but
B	mm
A	yeah
B	and I I'm I'm not a bad sort of sea traveller
A	mhm
B	but my husband is hopeless
A	really?
B	he just has to look at a white cap and he's sick
B	so er we don't do much in the way of
A	uh-huh
B	but er no
A	no
B	I know
A	stories and
B	there's three of them now isn't there
A	really? Three?
B	there was a there was another one this weekend
B	there was some sort of issue
A	gosh
B	yeah
A	well well makes you ask the question if there's always been issues
B	mm
A	but they're only just
B	er er er
A	reporting on them now
B	exactly
A	Cos it's all the rage after the
B	but that last one
A	mm
B	the captain's got to be at fault hasn't he
A	I know
B	too close to the island I think
A	definitely
B	Don't you?
A	and he wasn't even up on the bridge
B	I know
A	when
A	mm
B	before everybody else and
A	yep
B	huh
A	yeah
B	he might he'll need a good defence lawyer
A	won't be coming here will he?
B	no
A	and do you travel a lot? I notice you're
B	I do
A	wearing a
B	oh
A	is that Japanese?
B	er no
A	or Chinese?
B	it's Chinese
A	oh okay
B	yeah
A	uh-huh
B	I do love travel
A	uh-huh
B	I like the harbour
A	oh
B	er I like the opera house
A	mhm
B	you know the walk to the
A	how often have you been?
B	I've been I think three times
A	mhm
B	and so I feel with some authority that I can say
B	that it's my favourite place
A	mm
B	it's such a long way isn't it
A	which route did you take?
B	er
A	mhm
B	or one time we went via America
A	mm
B	Los Angeles and went that way
A	oh did you break up the journey?
B	mm
A	and stayed over in Los Angeles?
B	yes
A	that's a good idea
B	yeah
A	Cos
B	yeah
A	it is a long long journey
B	it is a long journey
B	and er no I I just
A	yep
B	it it and I
A	mhm
B	tut there we are
A	yes
B	we'll see
B	but er cos you've got a reason to go to Australia as well
A	well kind of
B	mm
A	um my brother you mean?
B	yes
A	yeah
B	aha
A	twelve years
B	tut
A	so
B	mm
A	he was like oh yeah come and visit me in Australia
A	it would've been so easy for you to
B	mm
A	come and
B	yes
A	pop over and visit me
B	yeah
A	Cos his girlfriend at the time was working at British Airways
B	ah
A	too
B	ah right
A	and now at the the kind of the idea of me paying him a return visit but all the way
B	tut
A	over the other side of the world
B	yes
A	and I did it um well I went to Melbourne
B	is that where your grandmother is is it?
A	yeah
B	oh I thought that's right yeah
A	five years ago
B	oh okay
A	and that journey just
B	yeah
A	er
B	mhm
A	I took  I took  two weeks off work to do it
A	and yep
B	fff
A	not enough really
B	it isn't
A	and I went um I think it was via Dubai
B	tut
A	and so the journey was er roughly about thirty hours
B	so long
A	and when I got there cos I find travelling mm tut east no west to east a lot worse than travelling
B	the other way
A	east to west
B	right
A	um
B	jet lag
A	jet lag
B	mm
A	wasn't just the feeling of wanting to go to bed when everyone else was getting up and vice versa
B	oh really?
A	bones
B	oh wow
A	so by the time I'd er
B	enjoy it and it's time to come back again
A	exactly
B	mm
A	so I just thought
B	mm
A	huh
B	no
A	mm
B	or being able to go business class
A	mhm
B	and er you know just to
A	or Concorde
B	er er but well yes
A	definitely
B	I think so
A	how long have you spent in in Sydney?
B	er three weeks
A	mm
B	and er drove right round the islands
A	mm
B	for er er about two weeks
B	Sydney on the way back
A	oh
B	and it's just seeing different countries and
B	I just think it's wonderful
B	oh this year well this year
A	on the itinerary
B	we're going to er we're going to northern Cyprus
A	mm
B	my brother-in-law's has er a place out there
A	mhm
B	so we're going to just spend ten days at the end of May and just er do that
A	mhm
B	and then in September October we're going up to
A	uh-huh
B	and so we er I've never done it
A	mhm
B	in the time we've been together
A	ah
B	and then maybe Christmas we'll do something else
A	exciting
B	yes
A	and relaxed
B	I think so  I think so  I think it's quite
A	whereabouts are you going in
B	er we go up as far as
A	mhm
B	er cos that's where my dad was from
A	okay
B	and er so the idea is to take him
A	oh
B	so were gonna take his ashes back
A	sorry
B	and we're going to go onto the
A	oh
B	he started his his life
A	uh-huh
B	so there's a er a loch called
A	uh-huh
A	aw
B	so that's the plan
A	that's a lovely thing to do
B	well he he was from there
A	mhm
B	and he his heart was really always in
A	really
B	and so I just feel that it would be nice
A	mhm
B	that's what he wanted
A	aw
B	so there we are
A	oh that sounds like a lovely journey
B	so yeah
A	okay
B	so er so there we are
A	and does he still have family around there
B	yes
B	my aunt is in er
A	mhm
B	and then I have cousins who live in
A	mhm
B	so it's you know sort of all on that east coast
A	right
B	and er it's very beautiful
A	have you er
B	I think er yeah it'll be nice round there
A	cool
B	yeah
B	in fact er we'll probably sort of invite them and all have a bit of a gathering
A	yeah
B	and er and then probably have afternoon tea after we've sort of done what we've got to do
B	so it'll be quite nice to catch up with everybody then
A	lovely
B	so um so yeah
B	and they're really quite broad
B	in terms of er understanding what they're saying
A	they don't
B	so yeah
A	don't come with subtitles?
B	no no
A	is there an app on your mobile phone for that?
[ANNOTATION]	there's an app that adds subtitles to the stuff B is watching	Neutral
B	I don't think there is actually
A	and have you
A	ever traced your ancestry?
B	no
A	no?
[ANNOTATION]	B has researched their geneaology	Contradiction
B	no
A	uh-huh
B	my mum's family were from

B	have you ever done it?
A	no
B	oh okay
[ANNOTATION]	A hasn't traced their ancestry either	Entailment
A	me personally no
B	no?
A	there were a
B	did they?
A	looking into I think my grandma's
B	aha
A	family on my dad's side
B	oh right
A	and they travelled up to
[ANNOTATION]	A is telling B what they know about their family history	Entailment
B	oh did they?
A	to look at some registry or
B	oh okay
A	I can't remember what it was
B	oh
A	no they found out
[ANNOTATION]	one of A's relatives did some research about their geneaology	Entailment
B	I bet
A	things
B	and the advantage is you've still got your grandmas haven't you
A	ah yeah
B	although I know your one is in Australia
A	uh-huh
B	but I guess you speak to her
A	oh no
B	no
A	she's quite um she's quite modern
B	is she?
A	she does
B	is she?
A	she does er travel on one of those little scooter things
B	oh does she?
A	you know that the kids have
B	oh great
A	around the old people's home
B	she doesn't sort of
A	do technology
B	oh okay
A	bless her
B	so
A	yeah
B	sort of ask the questions
A	mm
B	about our
A	mhm
B	we take things for granted
A	yeah
B	how are they related? And what you know how do they fit into the family?
B	and I think it it'd be quite nice to know wouldn't it really
A	definitely
B	yeah
A	a family bible that's been handed down
B	tut
A	from generation to generation
B	yeah
A	and I think it was her great great great grandmother
B	oh gosh
A	who started the tradition of actually writing in
B	oh really?
A	the names of all the children in the family
B	ah
A	that was passed down to the next generation who then they wrote in the names of
B	how nice
A	so yes
B	oh that's lovely
A	yeah
B	isn't it
A	isn't it
B	so it's a good record isn't it
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	not so much yeah um tut not so much so that you'd know anything about these people
B	but who their their names are
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	mm
B	a good start isn't it
A	mm
B	because otherwise it I think er er there's a programme you perhaps didn't see it when you if you were in Spain but there was um a programme Who Do You Think You Are?
A	mm
B	I think it was called
B	again it was tracing back
B	yeah
A	amazing
B	but they had um
B	real personalities
A	uh-huh
B	you know
A	uh-huh
B	and um tut er poets and broadcasters and all sorts of
A	uh-huh
B	you know fairly well-known people
A	really?
B	they took them all round the world
A	uh-huh
B	and er you know found out stuff er bad things about some of them
A	really?
B	er
A	mhm
B	er the vast majority of the times
A	mhm
B	and they they'd bring out photographs and a little bit about themselves
A	uh-huh
B	which was really quite narrow
A	mhm
B	from the records
A	uh-huh
B	like start off
B	really good
A	mm
B	because it was  it was
A	mm
B	just so very interesting
A	it sound it
B	yeah it was
A	sounds very interesting
B	yeah
A	it's just got a cheesy name
B	yeah
B	er like er I think the last series was about mm maybe six months ago I guess
A	mhm
B	something like that
A	mhm
B	and then they do this series of programmes
A	okay
B	which is er so tut I'd recommend it
A	can you  can you  remember any of the celebrities that have found out
B	er
A	bad things
B	er bad things? Now let me think
A	mhm
B	that they'd you know sort of been on on the edge of some naughty things
B	and then there were some others who were er they I mean they could trace it back to
A	mm
B	some some found
A	oh wow
B	er so er again you know really really interesting
A	mm
B	stuff
B	but it
A	very interesting
A	they have websites to do that as well nowadays
B	yes
A	don't they?
B	but they do
A	mm
B	swiss er
A	mm
B	house isn't it
A	mhm
B	and so I think yeah just depends how deep you want to go
A	mm
B	um out of interest
A	yeah
B	something for the future maybe
A	definitely
B	mm
A	well I think my parents also found out from my mum's side that one of her great great uncles was the first man to visit the Tonga Islands
B	oh I say
A	as a missionary and not get eaten by the natives
B	that's good er
B	fancy that
A	claim to fame
B	fancy that
A	where are they? I think they're South Pacific
B	oh okay
A	maybe
B	oh okay
A	somewhere around there
B	mm
A	I think maybe when the Brits were going out to
B	yeah
A	civilize the barbarians
B	yes
B	tut
A	barbarians and
B	mm
A	and got eaten for their troubles
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	well
B	uh-huh
A	I've got this project on the go
B	mm
A	which um I've got quite a lot of paperwork to fill in for it
B	right
A	and
B	and er is so who's
A	it's er a Cambridge
B	oh okay
A	university Press
B	oh right
A	within Cambridge University Press
B	oh right
A	called the spoken British Spoken Corpus
B	oh right
A	or the
B	so how did you get involved with that then?
A	oh I just saw er an advert online
B	oh
A	Cos I was
B	looking for work
A	that's another one of my jobs at the moment is
B	oh I see
A	looking for a job
A	um
B	is that something you're going to do again in the future maybe?
A	that's something that I hope I don't have to do
B	oh
A	it's there as a fallback
B	okay
A	plan
B	right
A	but um tut I don't know
B	right
A	when I think maybe when you're young you're more flexible and you're more likely to accept completely illogical irrational ways of working
B	right
A	that um maybe at you're at a disadvantage when you've already got the experience of working in a very productive way
B	mm
A	you're thrown into an environment that is
B	tick the boxes? That sort of thing?
A	yes
B	very
A	yeah
B	very performance-driven and
A	target-driven
B	yes
A	and not
B	yeah
A	achievement-driven
B	tut
A	and
B	yeah
A	the the different layers of the society inside the school don't you know they kind of chafe against each other
B	right
A	overall
B	right
A	they're secondary
B	oh right
A	yes
B	mm
A	yes
B	quite challenging I imagine
A	very challenging
B	mm
A	yep
B	did you not fancy doing primary school at all?
A	um
B	right
A	um
B	yeah
A	I love teaching English
B	yes
B	mhm
A	and um you know I've obviously there are tut pros and cons for any age group
B	yes
A	or any
B	sure
A	and I chose secondary because I could specialize in teaching languages
B	forte was
A	yeah lied
B	mm
A	and my forte
B	mm
A	picking it apart and
B	yes
A	putting it back together
B	right
A	yes it's so that's why I chose secondary
B	right
A	for the languages
B	yeah
A	to then try and teach it to a class full of people who don't wanna be there
B	absolutely
A	seeing no motivation whatsoever for learning a language
[ANNOTATION]	People who learn a new language are always motivated.	Contradiction
B	fff
A	soul destroying really
B	mm
A	um
B	yes
A	languages
B	absolutely
A	and um or or mm in my experience as a teacher of adults and children tut I've always managed to convey that to them
B	enthusiasm
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A is good at imparting knowledge.	Entailment
B	mm
A	or or they've been able to convey that to me
B	yes
A	to some extent about it
B	disruptive
A	wanna get involved
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A is working as a teacher for the last decade.	Neutral
A	and were disruptive
B	yeah
A	two or three in a class of twenty
B	who don't want to play
A	you can't
B	pff
A	I mean there's no way that you can teach
B	mm mm tut
A	when you've got twenty disruptive students
B	pff
A	and such a large class of students
B	mm
A	raw materials with which to tut get them there with
[ANNOTATION]	Students are always obedient.	Contradiction
B	yes
A	really really tough
B	mm
A	I mean er fff you imagine things like bringing a pen to school would be something that's dealt with top down and from all directions
[ANNOTATION]	Naughty students make teaching difficult.	Entailment
B	absolutely
A	er and yet no it wasn't
B	no pen?
A	no
B	absolutely
A	properly
B	yes
A	er if not just don't have a uniform
[ANNOTATION]	Students only bring pencils at school.	Contradiction
B	yes
A	but don't er enforce a uniform policy but then don't enforce it and let
B	yeah
A	everybody believe that oh well it's there but we don't have to respect it so
B	tut
A	we're just not gonna respect anything
B	tut
A	to school
B	yeah
A	exactly
B	if you  if you  haven't got that sort of
A	mhm
B	er discipline and uniformity then
A	exactly
B	and I I I think the successful schools that you hear about in the news I I mean I
A	really?
B	I I
A	mhm
B	you know you hear about successful schools
A	mm
B	and I think it is things like
A	mhm
B	the way you present yourself
A	mhm
B	and I think then you are er er having a successful lesson
A	mm
B	aren't you
A	mm
B	because you've you started off in the right frame of mind
A	yeah
B	and er and as you say basic things like you know your materials your your pen
A	mm
B	your paper your your books
A	mhm
B	you know phones off
A	yep
B	sometimes I like I'm walking down here and I see er you know girls going to school
A	mhm
B	and er you know skirts er
B	record
B	but er I just er
A	skirts as short as belts
B	just er I just don't think it's the way forward
A	no
B	no
A	oh
B	mm
A	and they er the whole attitude well at least in the schools that I saw was that we're here for a social experience
B	mm
A	we're here to enjoy each other's company
B	huh
A	it's like
A	letting them go in looking like
B	mm
A	yeah
B	never mind going to
A	no
B	to learn
A	exactly
B	no
A	and er obviously if you're a primary teacher you can control your own rules on a daily basis
B	yes
A	but when you're a secondary teacher and these kids are going to about eight you know
B	mm
A	six seven different lessons every day with different people
B	tut
A	if that's not maintained
B	different standards
A	yeah
B	as well
A	if that's not maintained
B	tut
A	across all those six then
B	yeah
A	that can be really detrimental to their
B	absolutely
A	mm
B	I I fff I I I can understand where you're coming from
A	mm
B	for sure
A	mm
B	and um tut er you know the
A	is it a local school?
B	yes
A	okay
B	and er I just do an afternoon
A	uh-huh
B	help out with science or whatever they're doing really
A	oh
B	whatever
A	mhm
B	and I suppose the advantages of having er another person in the class is that you can perhaps work with those disruptive ones
A	yep
B	so that the rest of the class can get on with the business
A	yeah
B	and they are fairly receptive
A	mm
B	but I think with older ones it's real hard isn't it
A	it is
B	to enforce and er huh I just think it's in some ways unless you have got it from the very top and it it
A	mhm
B	it it's fed down and everybody's singing from the same hymn sheet
A	yeah
B	it's really really tough isn't it
A	and I think schools need to be a bit smaller as well
B	tut
A	to make them feel that everybody knows them
B	that's right
A	that they are treated as an individual
B	yes
A	as opposed to you boy in the corridor and
B	yeah er yeah yeah yeah I think that's
A	mm
B	absolutely right
B	yeah
A	and I think yeah no I think it needs to be all
B	the whole thing
A	yep
B	yeah
A	the whole system
B	I mean they do keep tweaking it
A	mm
A	mm
B	that they shouldn't be over thirty is it?
A	but they get they're only going to get bigger now
B	I think so
A	yep
B	and
A	yep
B	er I mean er huh it I just don't know how it's gonna resolve itself
A	mm
B	quite concerning really isn't it
A	it is
B	mm
A	basically they've
A	basically privatized it
B	that's it
A	mm
B	if they er are an academy and I suppose that's an incentive for people to go into those sort of environments
A	yes
B	and are they the right people?
A	well er yes
B	mm
A	tut
B	mm
A	but it's gonna depend on the personalities of the senior leaders
B	tut
A	as you said er you know if they're going into it for profit you should be questioning their motives to go for going into it
B	huh
A	but also it's going to be even more target-driven and
B	yes
A	achievement-led
B	because it's about league tables isn't it
A	yeah
B	really
A	and I er
B	mm
A	just so that they could make their targets
B	yeah
A	um tut I think in in a situation where er it's gonna get more fierce in that they're not gonna get their funding unless they do meet those targets
[ANNOTATION]	Regardless of if they meet the targets or not, they'll still get their funding	Contradiction
B	mm
A	what's gonna happen well
B	exactly
A	educational experience
B	yeah
A	and then you've got the worry of okay well you know parents who can afford to get their kids into certain schools
B	mm
[ANNOTATION]	It gets fierce in the way that you won't get your funding unless you meet the set out targets	Entailment
A	tut will you know huh
B	tut
A	parents who don't really care about their kids or don't invest time
B	no
A	and preparation in their
B	well you you do
A	it's just
B	er you see it don't you
[ANNOTATION]	When work life gets fierce, parents don't have time to care about their kids or spend time with them	Entailment
A	yeah
B	can they
A	that's just
B	never mind the other basic skills
A	yeah
B	that are needed in life and I just yeah find it
A	mm
B	really quite sad isn't it
A	it is
B	mm
A	it's horrendous
[ANNOTATION]	It's not a problem if parents don't have time to spend time with their kids	Contradiction
B	Cos er some of our customers are a bit like that
A	mhm
B	you know you er kind of take it all for granted don't you
A	tut
B	the reading aspect of it
A	definitely
B	have to take an oath and I've
A	mhm
B	so that you actually do read it out and
[ANNOTATION]	A is a parent	Neutral
A	right
B	er and it's interesting just how many
B	you know really just can't manage it
A	gosh
B	that's just another example of you know your own experience of of
[ANNOTATION]	There are parents who can afford to put their kids in certain fancier schools	Entailment
A	mhm
B	how people just aren't able to
A	yeah
B	deal with the basic stuff
A	and if these people are having children that
B	well absolutely
A	are now populating the schools
B	and if er they can't help them can they with homework
A	no
[ANNOTATION]	Children go to school and have homework.	Entailment
B	or encourage them in any way if they don't know how to do it themselves
A	and how can a teacher who's got thirty kids er plus
B	exactly
A	under their
B	start to to try and do those
A	yep
B	because er as you say er a teaching assistant costs a lot
A	mm
B	er or you know special needs er again they're having to look at that aren't they because
A	mm
B	it's all er costing isn't it
A	mhm
[ANNOTATION]	A teacher can take care and give special care to every student of theirs.	Contradiction
B	so yeah I er I I just don't know
A	mm
B	in er  in er in the  the health or in the police or in courts or
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Teaching assistants work for free.	Contradiction
B	schools at all
A	no
B	because I I do think as you rightly say that the it's manipulated isn't it
A	yep
B	to accommodate er the finance of it if you like
A	yeah
B	mm
A	of what people can achieve
[ANNOTATION]	Some children need help with their homework.	Entailment
B	that's right
A	because for some kids you know they're not academically minded
B	no
A	that doesn't necessarily mean that they won't just won't be as successful in life
B	and thrive in another way
A	yeah
B	Cos they're perhaps practical aren't they
B	and I  and I  think before we were in this er culture of performance that that was identified more wasn't it
A	mm
B	you know
A	yeah
B	you know gardening or whatever
[ANNOTATION]	Not all children are great for academics.	Entailment
A	definitely
B	it might be
A	mm
B	you know
A	definitely
[ANNOTATION]	Children who are not great in school can be successful in life as well.	Entailment
B	people don't you
A	and maybe even give them an avenue to develop that from
B	mm
A	a very early age
B	absolutely
A	as opposed to force people to go to school at the age of eleven and study things that their brains
B	doesn't
A	really aren't
B	no
[ANNOTATION]	Person B believe that it is soon for that early age study that things	Entailment
A	tut you know
B	are catered for
A	yeah
B	mm
A	um tut you know by by the age of twelve you've lost them
B	that's right
A	and they've become disruptive and
B	yeah
A	however if you get them into something or get them trying a lot of different things
B	that's right
[ANNOTATION]	Person B agreed with Person A about those who have become disruptive	Neutral
A	yeah
B	rounded aren't they
A	yeah
B	much
B	anyway there we are
B	maybe you'll you'll look at something like that in the future and try and embrace it
A	maybe
B	have you  have you  been approached to do er one to one er sort of training with anybody? You know
A	oh coaching and
B	yes
A	tutoring
B	yeah
A	things? Um
[ANNOTATION]	Person A is a down to earth person	Contradiction
B	uh-huh
A	are on the lookout for tutoring
B	do we really want to?
A	the course was so um it was four and a half months of of non-stop
[ANNOTATION]	Person A said the course last up four and a half months	Neutral
B	right
A	even
B	yes
A	look look for other things
B	yeah
A	to get experience in other things
[ANNOTATION]	Person A think that they are bagged in here	Contradiction
B	yeah
A	and um
B	so have you got ideas at all?
A	well at the moment I'm applying for a lot of jobs in publishing
B	oh okay
A	tut
B	get something there
B	I hope so
[ANNOTATION]	Person B is hoping for Person A to get a job	Neutral
A	yeah
B	for sure
A	I hope so too
B	yeah
A	I'm
B	are you? Yes
A	as per the area
B	yeah
A	I'd prefer to stay commutable distance
B	yes
A	or not to live here and to
B	no
A	commute
B	that's right
A	um
B	family connections
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	definitely
B	yeah
A	but London doesn't really
B	appeal
A	appeal
B	mm
A	so I
B	yeah
A	jobs at the moment
B	and are they where are most of the er opportunities
A	tut
B	otherwise?
A	well I was looking into becoming er a trilingual personal assistant
B	ah
A	and um tut that definitely is very London London
B	is it?
A	centric
B	oh
A	yeah so I kind of put that one that idea on the backburner just because
B	tut
A	tut
B	tut
A	so however no jobs are coming up in
B	really? Oh what a shame
A	the linguistic field
B	oh really?
A	I think Spanish
B	tut
A	yeah
B	too common is it?
A	mm
B	tut
A	it's such a shame
B	it is
B	Cos that would be so interesting wouldn't it
A	it would be
B	lovely
B	lovely
B	very nice indeed
A	really?
A	what's been?
B	well er
A	because of the murder of that guy
B	tut
A	oh okay
B	er concerns about er you know er whether there's any terrorists'
A	uh-huh
B	threats
A	mhm
B	I think to tap phones
A	tut
B	but obviously I think they have to have authorities and
A	uh-huh
B	er I think that was really what they were talking about
A	yes
B	tut
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	and the whole area
A	yeah
B	go
A	that's right
B	so that's really nice isn't it
A	is it the Cotswolds? Is it called?
B	well you're into the Cotswolds
A	yeah?
B	yeah
A	oh that would be so nice
B	wouldn't it just
A	really lovely
B	mm
A	places in Oxford
B	tut
A	and Cambridge
B	tut
A	and
B	ooh
A	huh
B	very nice areas
A	yeah
B	tut
A	that's a lovely place
B	tut
A	uh-huh
B	so yeah we um er we're sort of at the stage where we're really thinking about sort of moving on
A	really?
B	and er well
A	where where would you move to?
B	well we we'd probably
A	okay
B	sort of the Cotswolds
A	mhm
B	but of course it's very desirable and
A	yes
B	quite expensive
B	so I don't know
A	mhm
B	so yeah
A	oh
B	er er well it's going very close to where we live
A	oh
B	from our house
A	no
B	which is not good
A	oh
B	in the next five years
A	crikey
B	so it's not very good is it really
A	oh
B	tut
A	that kind of changes somewhat
B	yes
A	the whole fabric of the
B	the village really
A	the town
B	so I think er huh I don't know
A	mm
B	going to be good
A	where does your husband work?
B	er he er has retired
A	oh
B	in December
A	lucky him
B	and he worked for the Criminal Case Review Commission
A	okay
B	tut er so he'd done that for fourteen years
A	mm
B	sort of retired from the police service before that
A	okay
B	so yeah still very much law
A	interesting
B	we can't get away from it can we
A	did you meet him here?
B	no
A	oh
B	met him in Hong Kong
A	what were you doing over there?
B	I went to visit some friends who were working over there
A	uh-huh
B	and er as a blind date
A	ah
B	tut
A	fantastic
B	so yeah  so yeah  And you know we er I mean he was in the police service in
A	uh-huh
B	and er and I was here
A	mhm
B	so I thought perhaps it would be good to finish off my service so I could get my pension
A	uh-huh
B	these days is good
A	mm
B	Cos there's not much about
A	uh-huh
B	he eventually finished
B	and er so yeah
A	excellent
B	that's the plan
A	and is he er a lad of leisure at the moment?
B	he
B	he's er he's got lots of sort of bits of DIY that he's been doing
A	really? Yeah it's
B	tut
A	it's a big adjustment
B	always worked
A	isn't it
B	yeah
A	especially if it's a job that you've been really passionate about and
A	mm
B	quite sort of intense stuff
A	mhm
B	and he's still very interested you know whenever something comes on the the TV or the radio he's you know he's there listening
A	tut
B	and can relate to who's dealing with that particular matter
A	mhm
B	right
A	can he do consulting on a very?
B	um I suppose if he wanted to
A	mhm
B	but hasn't actually taken the next step
A	tut
B	I mean he er went to Baddesley Clinton
A	ooh
B	and looked at there
B	talking about their knitting and what have you
A	oh
B	so whether he he will
A	but could he consult for the police or the?
B	um
A	mm
B	he would go down that road
A	private eye?
B	tut
A	detective?
B	fff
B	I don't think he'd fancy that
A	secret squirrel?
B	I don't think he fancies that somehow
A	no
B	no I can't  I can't  see him doing that
A	was he
B	who knows
A	getting a bit tired of the nine to five grind? Or?
B	huh
A	what was the?
B	I don't know what finally made his decision
A	mhm
B	how they change
A	tut
B	and how they're driven
A	yeah
B	by performance
A	uh-huh
B	and you know you you sort of move premises and and you know you whereas you were used to quite a lot of space to do things and er then it's closed
A	mhm
B	moving
A	mm
B	that I think he just thought tut fff do you know I think perhaps it's time to go
A	hmm
B	he thought about it long and hard and eventually decided that that it that was it
A	uh-huh
B	so there we are
A	aw
