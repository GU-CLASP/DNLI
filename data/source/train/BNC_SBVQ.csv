B	um
A	oh yeah
B	how long
A	quite recent
B	ah
A	you can put it on your skin afterwards and
B	and
A	and I told her what else did I say? Oh I told her about the exfoliator that you can um
B	dry it off
A	yeah that
B	yeah
A	yeah that's oil-based not well gel-based not shower cream-based
B	oh did she?
A	and I explained all about your skin problems and that being you know the one of the impetuses behind
B	oh
A	you setting up your business
B	that'd be great
A	if
B	where do they live?
A	they live in
B	oh okay
A	not far from me
B	okay
A	mm
B	yeah
A	we could go round together and
B	mm
A	mhm
B	all the labels
A	mm
B	so I've just e-mailed this stamp company to say could I have a stamp pad with three lines in and then just honest logo on its own
A	yeah
B	the logo is the line
A	but how do you stamp if you're gonna get a stamp with the logo and three different colour
B	so you'd choose your colour and then
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	so I've gotta see how much
A	have you got a provider for that? Have you got a supplier?
B	um yeah
A	okay
B	so um I think it'll be about fifteen pounds I think
A	yeah
B	the only problem I've got is is the ink going to run into the cotton bag? Cos they're fine on the boxes
A	yeah
B	so
A	that you can get that you can iron them and that fixes the ink?
B	oh I don't know
A	uh-huh
B	tut um that I needed it for cotton bags and boxes
A	mhm
B	in a couple of weeks and be there in the shop
A	ah fantastic
B	so that's good
A	jigsaw clothes shop?
B	yeah
A	mm
B	and then Jigsaw will put it on their Facebook and their Twitter and so that's a good thing
A	wow
B	yeah it is
A	uh-huh
B	so that's a good thing
A	is that the one in the city centre?
B	yeah
A	are you gonna have enough ingredients to make up enough products?
B	um
B	I've spoke to a guy this morning who found me on LinkedIn
A	oh yeah
B	he invited me to be to link with him
B	with no chemicals et cetera
A	fantastic
B	so er in a way it might be worth me going that way
A	yeah
B	so I can be out on the road selling
A	yeah
B	than making everything up when he's already got everything
A	wow
B	in Harrogate
A	Yorkshire
B	yeah
A	and you'd make all the stuff up
B	er oh sorry hon
A	brilliant
B	so that might be
A	and what does he want in return for that?
B	I'll obviously pay him
A	sounds brilliant
B	mm
A	cos he was looking for what was he looking for?
B	no he just he must have just seen me because
A	mm
B	I do have a lot of people actually I
A	mhm
B	so he's probably just seen Honest Skincare and read my profile
A	brilliant
B	no yeah
A	it's er it's the way to do it though
B	I know
A	mhm
B	and then get a price for a hundred
A	right

A	aw
B	this looks expensive
A	I'd love to have a little a bed with a little ladder going up to it
B	cabin beds look
A	aw
B	oh my gosh
A	mm
B	that's terrible
A	why not? It's the mattress that's important isn't it
B	here we go
A	um
B	to get organic water
A	to get organic water
B	I know
B	no
A	use?
B	but she said it's best to get organic

B	yeah
A	twelve minutes
B	er
A	how long is left now?
B	Seven minutes
A	huh
B	no bids

A	just check on IKEA first that you can get a mattress of those dimensions
B	what was it again? A hundred and forty
A	A hundred and forty
B	mm
A	by seventy was it? So are you still using the internet from next door? Do they know? No? Oh dear

A	mhm
B	and the sides come off and it turns into a bed
A	ah okay
B	um
A	hm
B	these are the mattress types
A	yeah
B	and then you've got your comfort grades
A	do they do all the different types for children's mattresses though? They might only
B	mm
A	do certain breeds
B	mm
A	eek
B	I'll just see what these are
A	okay
B	is that like yours then?
A	probably
B	mm
A	does it say in the dimensions part? Nope
B	I'm best getting it off Amazon aren't I babe
A	huh
B	it?
A	fingers crossed
B	I think they would've bid though you know by now
A	or maybe they're waiting to see if there's any other bids
B	please
B	oh
A	oh
B	I think they would've bid now
A	how long has it been on?
B	A week
A	mm
B	oh
B	I'm gonna have to just put it back on then I think
A	why don't you see what your competition's like for the other cots on there? To see how much
B	I did
A	really?
B	and the thing is in fact the mattress cos it's the bamboo organic one that was a hundred pounds in itself
A	right
B	or something
A	oof
B	I know
A	yeah
B	and I've gotta get
A	mm
B	pillow and all
B	yeah
A	has it finished already? The bidding
B	yeah
A	what a let-down
B	oh
A	are you disappointed?
B	I'm gonna relist it
A	can you just add all the same information? Or do you have to enter it all again?
B	yeah
A	so here
B	did you have more things that you were gonna put on there? Yeah
A	oh right
B	I can smell garlic babe
A	um possibly
B	did you?
A	I've brushed my teeth a few times since then though
B	how how is it in the house? How's
A	fine
B	is he?
A	a lot of er any of them really
B	really?
A	yeah
B	she's hardly ever there though is she
A	well she's been in London on a training course
B	oh okay
A	and then she stays at her boyfriend's quite a lot
B	oh er up the road here?
A	yeah
B	oh of course
A	yeah
B	oh yeah
A	that's right
B	I'm just gonna see how much beds are on Amazon now
A	are the
B	hm
A	no I know but er as are er uh is Amazon usually
B	er
A	shop items?
B	some er yeah most of the time
B	and er well I
B	she's like turned everything upside down
B	I was like oh this is ridiculous
A	streamlining her possessions
B	I think I need to
A	mm
B	so um I think it's time to make it into a pretty girly room
B	I dunno
A	mhm
B	so I think I'll get that to come over here
A	lovely
B	yeah
A	are you gonna keep that lampshade though? It's
B	yeah
A	lovely
B	yeah I'd like to put loads of flowers on that
A	mm
B	you know like the flowers I've put in the garden on the tree?
A	yeah
B	so yeah
A	oh fantastic
B	I know
B	bless her
A	what a novel idea
A	can I have a go?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	what I've done is I've I've put huh for instance here's all the oils
A	oh is this for the costing?
B	yeah
A	so these are  these are  broken down by product?
B	well what I've done so I've put all the ingredients
A	uh-huh
B	the size I buy it in
A	uh-huh
B	and the cost
A	uh-huh
B	that's without VAT
A	but are those the things that go into
B	no
A	ah okay
B	so I've got body polish
A	uh-huh
B	lips
A	uh-huh
B	that goes into it
A	mhm
B	and I've done that for all my products
A	wow
B	but I don't know if he's if that's
A	mhm
B	and we go thistle oil
A	ah okay
B	you get your thistle oil
A	yeah
B	so we need to divide
A	yeah
B	which give us the price for the thistle oil
A	yeah
B	do you see what I mean?
A	yeah
B	it's gonna it's such a hard long job
A	I'm sure it will be
B	um
A	are these in millilitres?
B	yeah
A	mhm
B	except for essential oils
A	right
B	so they all add up to a hundred
A	so where you've got your for example when you buy your bottles of lemon essential oil how many drops are in each bottle
B	um
A	okay
B	so
A	so it's twenty-four times thirty
B	I'm sure it's twenty-four drops
A	wait there sorry
B	one mil is twenty-four drops
A	so it'd be twenty-four times three
B	oh I dunno babe
B	God it's just doing my head in
A	no but
B	um
A	I think you've got all the raw data there that he'll need to be able to do the
B	but this isn't including VAT
A	mhm
B	Cos the formulation's changed
A	mhm
B	um
A	well as long as you've got on the original sheet how
B	mm
A	and the price of that
B	so um er the next thing I need to do for him now er is find the prices of my bottles
A	mhm
B	and I don't know the
A	mm
B	it all goes through
A	okay
B	but I'm not a hundred percent yet
A	so it's you've put the cost and then with VAT VAT?
B	vAT
A	what is it? Seventeen point point five percent?
B	yeah
A	oh okay
B	um
A	sixty-eight P
B	for
A	mm
B	anything you know heating
A	but it's a good idea to get an idea of what the cost is for each particular bottle
B	yeah
A	like if you
B	yeah
A	what it takes to make it costs this much
B	Cos my old cleanser cost me one pound seventy-nine to make
A	mhm
B	I sell my lip balm in fifteen mil
A	mm
B	it's that times that again times half isn't it
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	that we maybe go and see my dad at the same time
B	yeah
A	just lives round the corner
B	okay hon
A	and you can explain all this to him and he can ask you the questions
B	yeah
A	that he needs to ask
B	okay
A	to be able to manipulate it all into some kind of
B	when do you think er
A	coherent
B	yeah
A	well it'll depend on when
B	mm
A	my dad
B	yeah
A	really?
B	because I don't want her really going through it because
A	uh-huh
B	I don't know
A	yeah
B	um
A	uh-huh
B	I mean I could give it him and see what
A	well or if you want I'll
B	if he understands
A	I'll see my dad tomorrow
B	do you think he's gonna understand though if I'm not with if I haven't spoke to him?
A	well if you phone him?
B	I'm trying to think if he can um I just hope I've made it clear enough
A	what else have you got to do tomorrow?
B	tomorrow
A	Cos if you wanna come over to
B	okay
A	I'm pretty sure he's free tomorrow
B	is he?
A	you could sit down and er
B	go through stuff with him
A	yep
B	yeah
A	mm
B	see I could  I could  I was thinking about putting um tut Jane off anyway
A	is this the Dragon's Den lady?
B	yeah
B	but she met my mum last week and she said she's got some really good um she's been speaking to some people and she's er apparently mum said wait till you hear what she's done
A	oh wow
B	and she's got some er um tut costings from another skincare company er which
A	uh-huh
B	er she
B	so
A	but this stuff's nearly done
B	yeah
A	probably by next week you can have it all done and dusted and send it off to her before she actually needs it
B	it will won't it babe
A	hyper-organized
B	yeah
A	the pipettes and
B	that's it
A	with the labels
B	I've
A	I'm not surprised
B	they're just a nightmare
A	they sent you the wrong
B	yeah
A	er tops?
B	but basically
A	mhm
B	then if I know they're coming then I'll make sure that the driver's got the code to the gate to get into the house
B	she was horrible
A	yeah
B	you know after everything
B	I said um and then she went but there's um there's money outstanding
A	mhm
B	right so you had some sixty mil jars
A	tut fff
B	there was this box
A	huh
B	right okay
A	crikey
B	and um and in the end I just and I arranged to have the box er I said right then so what day would you like to come and collect this box
B	I said well come on Monday then
B	but they're just really dippy
A	and that's crazy blaming you for it
B	oh
A	superior?
B	God
A	mhm
B	to do it by hand I've done it before they're all wonky
A	mm
B	so I heard he had this machine
B	and asked
A	oh God
A	what a way to run a business
B	yep
B	yeah
A	product?
B	so I guess your dad will say I mean let's just do one for example
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	oh I haven't oh I have got a calculator on here
A	practice our numeracy skills
B	because I I've
B	with Mike's help
A	it's just a formula though isn't it
B	mm
A	get the
B	just er it's just head doing
A	hm
B	right
A	if you get some paper we can actually just like er we can probably work it out with a calculator and a pen and a paper
B	yeah
A	pen and some paper
B	ow
A	done these for? Was there just two?
B	how? Er three
A	three
B	okay
A	and then we can put a star by the ones that er are exempt from
B	okay
A	no
B	yeah
A	Don't sell it
B	mm
B	okay
A	what's?
B	so these are the ingredients
A	mhm
B	okay
A	okay
B	yeah
A	it's not on here?
B	no
A	do you get all your ingredients from the same supplier?
B	no
A	so
B	I'll just get the um
A	do you want me to write it down here?
B	one litre
A	wait there
A	how much is one litre?
B	is eight pounds
A	so here you've got six millilitres
B	six mil
A	so how many mil in one litre? A hundred?
B	A thousand
A	oh a thousand
B	A
A	yeah?
B	A thousand
A	okay
B	confused me then
A	so if you've got a thousand so it's how much was it?
B	um er um eight pounds
B	er
A	divided by
B	divided by
A	A thousand
B	um
A	oh here
B	oh no
A	oh no
B	um
A	round it up
B	so just two
A	nought point  nought point  nought five
B	just do
A	nought point nought five
B	nought five?
A	yeah
B	oh okay
A	put the next number up
B	oh right
A	you'd just keep it to
B	okay
A	nought point nought four
B	so nought point nought five
A	okay
B	okay
B	you just bought that water
A	er you can get it cheaper though if you buy it in bulk
B	okay
A	if you got like er a pack of six
B	let's just see on here
A	if they do organic sparkling water
B	oh let's just
A	maybe they were just um out of
B	I just I've never really er
A	out of stock
B	if you buy organic water you're a fucking idiot
A	yeah
B	oh Tesco
A	oh yeah look
B	oh here
A	Cos if you buy that in bulk I'm sure it'll cost a lot less than it would if you're buying it bottle by bottle in the supermarket
B	okay so for five hundred mil sixty-five P
A	wait there
B	um
A	five hundred mil sixty-five P
B	so just say for a litre it's gonna be one pound twenty
A	litre one pound
B	one pound twenty
A	twenty
B	just to be safe
A	okay
B	see what I should be doing now because preservative is used in all products
A	yeah
B	I've what we should do is um tut we should maybe find out the price for each ingredient
A	yeah
B	do you think?
A	yeah
B	and then I can add it up
B	that's how I did it before
A	mm
B	because we're gonna have to do preservative twenty-eight times
A	you see that's where my dad can probably do something nifty with an Excel wordsheet
B	mm
A	er spreadsheet
B	yeah
A	whereby it'll calculate it all
B	well we'll keep we'll do this one first babe and see what this one comes out as anyway
A	okay
B	so um water was four point eight
A	where has it got?
B	um
A	wait there
B	um hm
A	where are they?
B	oh I'm all confused
A	there you go
B	price
A	so those are the prices of the
B	what's that one then?
A	ingredients
B	and that's
A	oh well let's just write that
B	okay so for for um a hundred mil it's seven pounds ninety
A	A hundred mil
B	so what do I do? I go seven pounds ninety
A	yeah
B	divided by a hundred
A	if a hundred mil is seven pound ninety you wanna find out what one mil is
B	yeah
A	yeah? And then times it by the amount of millilitres you need in the product
B	so it's one
A	preservative twelve that was? No you need nought point six
B	oh nought point six
B	oh for one mil isn't it
A	nought point six what though?
B	but then
A	millilitres?
B	mil
B	just to cover with
A	well er surely that means you have to use the amount that they specify?
B	but Aromantic are saying that you don't have to you see
A	mhm
B	had I dunno what's gone on
B	yeah
A	uh-huh
B	so um I can really use up to one percent if I want
A	okay
B	just in case
A	okay
B	that's I think that's what I'll do
A	yeah
B	do you think?
A	yeah
B	because and then if I use less I use less
A	yeah
B	but I know that I'm not gonna use any more than one mil don't I?
A	mhm
B	do you think that makes sense?
A	yeah
B	okay
A	so it was one millilitre and?
B	um
A	was it seven seven pound ninety for one litre?
B	for a hundred mil
A	for a hundred mil?
B	yeah
A	okay
B	so seven pounds
B	ninety
A	divided by a hundred
B	divided by a hundred
A	times one
B	yeah so so nought point seven nine
A	nought point zero eight
B	nought point zero eight okay  nought point zero eight okay  Tut
B	huh
A	next ingredient is white clay
B	okay
A	er where are the clays? Here
B	two hundred and fifty
A	oh
B	grams
A	two fifty grams
B	so two hundred and fifty
A	two fifty
B	divided by one pound
A	yeah
B	that's gone like that though
A	product
B	um
A	did you
B	one pound eighty-five divided by
A	divided by
B	two hundred and fifty
A	and then times it by fifty
B	okay
A	which is apricot kernel oil
B	so
A	A hundred mil for six twenty-five
B	okay
A	yep
B	so when we add that up that's hardly anything to be honest
A	do you wanna tell me er?
B	nought point
A	or shall I?
B	nought five
A	plus four point eight
B	what?
A	Cos that er the water wasn't it can't
B	yeah
A	so
B	but no that's not right
A	four point eight pence
B	four four point eight
A	yeah
B	so I've got nought point
A	nought five
B	nought five
A	plus
B	plus
A	four point eight
B	that seems a lot
A	but you needed wait there
B	no it can't be right
A	you needed forty millilitres
B	yeah
A	are you sure there's only are you sure there's a thousand
B	yeah
A	millilitres in a litre?
B	thousand mil in a litre
A	that would make sense
B	Cos five hundred mil is a bottle like this
A	yeah
A	cos it's millilitre isn't it
B	yeah
A	so what's?
B	so um
A	so
B	so if um the water let's just tut
A	the water was one pound twenty for a litre
B	one pound twenty
A	er divided by a thousand
B	forty
A	yep
B	oh yeah
A	five
B	okay
A	so put nought point nought five
B	nought point again you see that's er the same as that isn't it?
A	yeah
B	oh okay babe
B	nought point nought five
A	plus
B	plus nought point nought five
A	plus nought point nought eight
B	nought point nought eight
A	plus nought point three seven
B	ninety-three P
A	oh okay
B	so that's for ingredients
A	mhm
B	I mean tut um jar
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	but again you can do that on Excel really easily
B	Cos I've got my laptop working now
A	yeah?
B	so I could get the um that would be easier for your dad
A	yeah but I mean he do you know how to
B	no
A	you see my dad's brilliant at stuff like that
B	is he?
A	or what what we could do
B	well I could shall I um
A	what we could do is do it with him
B	yeah
A	teach us how to do it
B	Cos what I might just
A	in the know
B	quickly
A	huh? Yeah
B	mm
B	um
B	Cos especially with his um especially um with the
A	mhm
B	Cos I'm just thinking that almond oil
A	yeah
B	so a hundred mil
A	mhm
B	so it costs me nought point do I have to have the nought?
A	er
B	or just put nought point nought
A	what do you mean? Sorry
B	would I have nought point nought three O? If we were rounding it off
A	if you er you you have to round it you can't round it up because that last digit is not higher than five
B	okay
A	so what you just do is get rid of that last digit
B	oh okay babe
A	so it's nought point nought three
B	so you'd have nought point nought three
A	so what's that? Nought point nought three pence?
B	yeah
A	so put
B	for one mil
A	put P next to it
B	okay
A	you got it clear what it is
B	okay
A	yeah
B	A cuppa tea
A	shall I put the kettle on? Or would you prefer coffee?
B	I dunno
A	no no no
B	what about this?
A	no it's fine
A	it's fine
B	it'll be funny though
A	yeah
B	like did you listen back to
A	no I didn't
B	what was he talking about?
A	gosh we were talking about loads of things
A	lots of different things
B	he's quite interesting isn't it
A	yeah
B	so on this one would I take away the five or have it nought point six three?
A	um
B	I
A	so you just have two decimal places after the point
B	yeah
A	and so if you got nought point nought six three you wouldn't round the six up to seven because the three
B	right
A	is below five
B	okay
A	yeah
B	okay
A	yeah
B	off er off all the ones that I do
A	yeah
B	more than five
A	but it's not gonna make a huge difference
B	okay
A	but it's good to be precise
B	yes
A	really?
B	but because um these are like smaller
A	yeah
B	like the clay
A	so how much if a hundred millilitres of almond oil is three pound ten how much would like
B	A litre be
A	a litre be?
B	I dunno
A	yeah
B	you'd save so much money wouldn't you
A	you'd probably be buying it at a quarter of the price wouldn't you
B	isn't it
A	yep
B	you can tell I didn't pass maths at school
A	then again I can't believe I'm teaching
A	yeah I know but English not maths
A	I'm awful  I'm awful  with numbers
B	oh no er you're clever you are
A	my dad'll probably turn around and say you've done this all wrong
B	no
A	to times it by a hundred
B	no you did it right
B	okay
A	so I'd always be working out how much I'd get paid
A	and then I'd have to work out the um the tax that I'd have to pay and
A	so it was all about
B	what's that one babe? I am listening to you
A	um
B	one nought point one seven
A	no
B	nought point two
A	you wouldn't round
B	yeah
A	so what do you do to the second figure?
B	so it'd be nought point one seven
A	yeah
B	okay
A	but why why would you
B	because that's
A	into seven?
B	because the eight is higher than five
[ANNOTATION]	That five is the higher number.	Contradiction
A	yep
B	okay
B	how am I gonna teach Ava when she goes to school?
A	that are pretty competent
B	God babe I can really smell garlic
[ANNOTATION]	That there's no smell to garlic.	Contradiction
A	huh huh
B	what did you eat?
A	um
B	was it nice?
A	something? Oh it was gorgeous
B	mm
A	as you can smell
B	have you seen um tut Ruchi?
A	yeah
B	was she? Aw
A	she's better
B	are they?
[ANNOTATION]	That the person has a good sense of smell.	Contradiction
A	now they're a lot better now they've they're not as swollen
B	see mine have come up
A	oo
[ANNOTATION]	That the swlling remains as it was.	Contradiction
B	but
A	painful
B	they're not um this is good really
A	mhm
B	but they're but I've noticed my hands are drier
A	mm
B	because your your skin does change
A	well it was cos she had er I think she had a bit of eczema under her wedding ring
B	she's er allergic to her wedding ring isn't she?
A	I don't know whether it is that or whether it was just because the eczema was under a ring it started to fester
B	Cos the the um
[ANNOTATION]	That there's different speeds of eczema.	Neutral
A	right
B	even earrings
A	ah
B	because of the metal
A	mm
B	so she shouldn't wear any jewellery
[ANNOTATION]	That she doesn't wear jewelery.	Contradiction
A	yeah
B	mm
B	aw that's what I had to do
A	tut aw
B	oh bless her
A	but she's got steroids and antibiotics
B	tut
A	and it's taken away the infection um but
B	it's the worst thing you know
A	now her hands you know are
B	it's the worst thing to have
A	after you've had like swollen tut infections
B	are they weeping as well? With water?
A	not anymore
B	oh God I feel so sorry for her
A	mm
B	but she definitely shouldn't you should tell her not to wear a wedding ring
A	mm
B	um
A	mm
B	than normal
A	mm
B	then that says because they er they reckon hand dermatitis is er and foot dermatitis is down to stress
A	really?
B	the main thing
A	mhm
B	and you'd still react
A	mm
B	oh I feel so sorry for her
A	uh-huh
B	so in a way I er maybe I should speak to her
A	gauze?
B	mm
A	or something like that
B	but I've got these lovely gloves from the doctors
A	are they silk?
B	they're beautiful babe
B	so if she goes to the doctors and I went and said you know I've heard about these gloves
B	but these ones are really nice
A	oh I'll tell her
B	I'll try and find them in a minute
A	what are they made out of?
B	um
A	yeah
B	Cos cos it's hot
A	yeah
B	and with dermatitis you
A	mm
B	and then
A	urgh
B	for the skin to come off to reheal
A	mm
B	and then what they do at the skin hospital is you take in every single product that you use
A	uh-huh
B	and they cover it with tape
A	mhm
B	so you can't shower for a week
B	and then you go back in a week's time and they take it all off
A	mhm
B	and I reacted to er nearly every single one
A	huh
B	it was all red
A	oh no
B	after it had all come off
A	mm
B	the ingredients from that product
A	really?
B	because lavender's got geranial in it
A	ah
B	and geranial is an irritant for people with eczema and dermatitis
A	but isn't lavender oil just pure lavender oil?
B	no it's got it's obviously got things in it
A	oh
B	and that's like on my products I've got lavender
A	mm
B	do you see what I mean? So
A	tut
B	Cos it's the components
A	blimey
B	probably more than that
A	really?
B	and they take out the strongest ones
A	mhm
B	and the percentages
A	you would've thought that lavender essential oil would just in just
B	hm
A	contain lavender oil pressed from the flowers
B	yeah
A	oh the
B	it's still got you know
A	yeah
B	and um
A	the components of the oil
B	I'm trying to think
A	really? So what is gernial? Is it a?
B	it's a
A	A
B	it's a component of camomile
A	so it's a natural perfume?
B	yeah
A	mm
B	you know
A	oh well
B	so
A	people who are
B	mm
A	allergic to it can see what's in it
B	but I was shocked because I couldn't understand with all this Hauschka business
[ANNOTATION]	there is a lot of Hauschka business	Entailment
A	but the
B	so er so I'm like hang on so I'm like what the hell? This is what I've reacted to
A	right
B	so that's why my
A	ah okay
B	so I've got nothing in there that would harm
A	mm
B	so if I went if that's why I use my calming cream
A	but do you react to your products
B	I could do
A	that have got geranial in?
B	I could do
A	mhm
[ANNOTATION]	Person B does not use calming cream	Contradiction
B	and say I'm not very well
A	mhm
B	but if my hormones change and I use something then maybe yeah
A	mm
B	but my calming range I wouldn't
A	mm
B	but I can't use them
A	yeah
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Person A uses calming cream	Neutral
A	that they name it in a certain way
B	so it just
A	mm
B	the um what people are putting on their skin
A	hm
B	that's a bit noisy
A	I know
B	this guy came down the road earlier
[ANNOTATION]	no one came down the road today	Contradiction
A	mm
B	picking up the um your fridges and your
A	oh
B	freezers and your metal
A	the scrap metal guys
[ANNOTATION]	scrap metal guys will not pick up fridges	Contradiction
A	yeah
B	oh really
A	they play a little melody
B	aw
A	crazy crazy
B	right
A	oh
[ANNOTATION]	no one plays music	Contradiction
A	to where?
A	where's that?
B	in town
A	who are you going there with?
A	who's
B	oh he's a really really old friend
A	mm
B	God um I've he's been my friend for about since I was about eighteen
A	can't you get a free gym membership with him then?
B	oh God
A	oh
B	the
B	but one thing he's doing in the summer he's
A	mhm
B	and it's his show and he has people pay to have their stands
A	ah fantastic
B	so I'm really looking forward to that
A	when's that?
B	I'm not sure yet
B	made and
A	it's not when you're thinking of going to Dubai is it?
B	I think it's September you know
A	cool
B	yeah
A	where did you meet him?
B	um he's from
A	aw
B	um
A	aw
B	which was really nice
A	did he set up his own business from scratch?
B	yeah
A	uh-huh
B	but the thing is I didn't really wanna ask him
A	mm
B	because he's a friend and he cos he gave me my deposit like I I just feel a bit bad
A	or er tut
B	you know
A	view it as a loan? And give it him back
B	mm
A	ah
B	no
A	mm
B	he's like in that industry
A	mhm
B	he sells products with his name and stuff on
A	mhm
B	and er or
A	cool
B	and I think he's doing supplements and things like that
A	so what time are you gonna meet him?
B	I dunno
A	is it?
B	late it was
A	blimey
B	and I don't mind really
A	oh
B	but I've got no trainers
A	ah
B	trainers
A	where's that?
B	at
A	oh okay
B	I nearly said more cocks
A	little Freudian slip there
A	how do you get there from here?
A	is that
B	but I don't know if I can be bothered
A	is it Acocks Green?
B	no
A	oh right
B	it's um past um so you go down
A	mhm
B	past the lights
A	uh-huh
B	before you get to
A	oh
B	it's cos it's so light
A	yeah
B	yeah
B	could couldn't we babe
B	just go to the loo
A	okay
B	alright hon
B	just see if um
A	so how much are the bags?
B	apparently he rang me back
A	which ones are these? Are they the the brown paper ones? Or the
B	um
A	are they from the same supplier?
B	yeah
A	oh they're lovely
B	have you seen the cotton bag in there?
A	yeah
B	so
A	mm
B	well these are the ones I really liked
A	is it the raw cotton ones? The the kind of stiff ones?
B	these are them
A	they're lovely
B	um
A	mhm
B	and I think that looks it's nice isn't it
A	hm
B	because that's just not gonna they need to carry it
A	can you not have bags like that er just with the little loops on the top?
B	they're not strong enough
A	ah
B	for instance my body scrubs are big glass
A	okay
[ANNOTATION]	Person A is going to have a sandwich	Contradiction
B	um five hundred mil jars
A	yeah
B	and they're really heavy
A	which ones?
B	ah
A	mhm
B	but I just think they're a bit er
A	but why would those be strong enough if the brown paper bag wouldn't be?
B	um
A	uh-huh
B	but these bags are really expensive
[ANNOTATION]	Person B think that this bags are not worth it and they are more than their budget	Entailment
A	ah they're glossy so they're really
B	and they're a bit
A	mhm
B	if I got two sizes
B	tut
A	is it the same ones as
B	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Person B is going to do some hair cut	Contradiction
A	got in the the other room?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	that's really nice
A	yeah
B	but they're expensive
A	phew
B	well it'd be that one
A	oh those are the jute ones? And how much are the cotton ones?
[ANNOTATION]	Person A is going to have a sandwich	Contradiction
B	tut
A	ah they're
B	twenty-five for eight ten?
A	no
B	that doesn't make sense does it?
[ANNOTATION]	Person B think that it is not logical	Entailment
A	it doesn't
B	let's just put in there twenty-five
A	huh
B	oh God
A	two hundred and two
B	oh God
A	ten the price is reduced
B	mm God what am I doing? I just wanna see
[ANNOTATION]	Person B is going to dance	Contradiction
A	you see these ones are really I mean I
B	yeah
A	are the cotton ones cheaper than the jute ones or the Hessian ones?
A	I don't know
B	the cotton?
A	yeah
B	see and the other thing is right so
A	and they can reuse those as well
B	problem is I would've liked them white but it doesn't matter
A	mhm
B	and they open it and this is to send out samples
A	mhm
B	and then that will go
A	yeah
B	with Honest
A	lovely
B	and that's why I want white
A	yeah
B	and then I'll post that
A	yeah
B	nice box
B	nice products
B	it's simple
A	have you bought boxes before?
B	no
A	mm
B	you know cos it's er
A	have you tried Alibaba dot com?
B	yeah
A	oh
B	it's an absolute nightmare
A	yeah
B	but I just can't afford to buy in packs like that
A	what what are the pricings for like a thousand?
B	um well it's just I dunno but it's um hang on
A	Cos if it wasn't more
B	um yeah
A	mhm
B	um
A	yeah
B	Cos I don't wanna send out too many products do I?
A	hm
B	mm
A	giving them out free
B	that's what I mean
A	have you not got sample sized like little small? Can or isn't there some kind of machine that makes foil packages of?
B	oh God yeah
A	yeah
B	like for instance to send a cleanser in that size that's thirty mil
A	mhm
B	on my printer really I've got to make my own labels that look really professional
A	mhm
B	just to send out samples
A	I'm sure that there's some kind of er thing in Word
B	really?
A	with which you can do labels
B	okay
A	and she did all the the admin work
B	oh really?
A	and very good work or
B	so you can put your logo on there?
A	yeah
B	oh really? Aw that's
A	actually I think I've still got some
B	yeah
A	professional they can look
B	like good
A	yeah
B	okay
A	if it is just on the
B	yeah
A	just um rectangular?
B	okay
A	and you can do them as small or as large as you need them
B	that's what I need to do then
A	yeah
B	so I don't really need a box
A	yeah
B	Cos the mask isn't gonna cost me much to send
A	what's the cheapest products that you have to make?
B	um
A	so you could maybe stock up on the toners in the samples
B	the thing is when er I need to send out really um
A	that kind of works doesn't it?
B	yeah
A	is the lid on that top one properly?
B	on that one? Yeah
A	no that's not gonna close
B	or if I had tissue paper printed with Honest on
A	yeah
B	then that would take up space
A	yeah
B	could undo the sticker
A	how about a little candle? You know the tea light
B	mm
A	size? That would fill
B	yeah
A	the space
B	yeah
A	then again those are more expensive aren't they
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	well why not just get um in that case tissue
B	yeah
A	A bit of ribbon with the logo on and just tie it around
B	yeah
A	pop it in a bag
B	or I don't even have to have a box
A	yeah
B	do I?
A	no
B	yeah
A	which you could probably do in a
B	look
A	yeah
B	could just have that in the post couldn't you
A	yeah
B	mm
A	what did you do for
B	oh I just had lots er just gave her loads of these
A	oh okay
B	no
A	feedback from them?
B	oh er no
A	who did she give them to?
B	just people that were looking at her show that but she did say that um she was gonna give them to the best people
A	yeah
B	you know
A	yeah
B	would've been nice
B	would've been nice to have um that with Honest ribbon
A	can you not rethread them?
B	mm
A	you could do
B	I could do
A	yeah
B	tut well
B	there's huh so far my list of salons I have over three hundred
A	phew
B	but
A	that's a lot
B	yeah
A	mhm
B	she said I'll just show you her website
A	well is it interior?
B	yeah
A	oh er it's er lots of different things
B	she even sells Tonfisk
A	mhm

B	so she sells all really nice things
A	does she already have
B	no
A	nice
B	yeah
A	ah
B	and there's my Tonfisk
B	there are my cups look
A	oh no
B	Cos they're so expensive
A	blimey
B	I know
A	is it wood?
B	for one
A	er
B	yeah
A	oh only the handle
B	er and my actual tea-pot which is that one
A	huh
B	and I'd got er I've got that
A	oh my God
B	and I've got one of those and I've got that
B	but um and I was hoping that she had seen my picture on Twitter
A	uh-huh
B	my tea my tea-pot
B	so someone like her is perfect to have
A	how did you get in touch with her?
B	she got in touch with me
A	oh okay
B	tut so if I ordered some of these
A	yeah
B	instead of wasting it on packaging
A	definitely
B	Cos
A	oh okay
B	that's why I've still got that one
B	sorted that so
B	yeah
A	er too much packaging
B	yeah
A	ethos as well doesn't it
B	so in which case hon that's
A	mhm
B	I'm trying to think if I can use it for anything else
A	the bag?
B	yeah
A	no
B	let me just try this candle
A	have you got a tape measure?
B	yeah
A	do you know where it is? Er is it in the kitchen?
B	tut um yeah
A	have you checked the candle fits okay? Yeah
B	perfect
A	perfectly
B	so my candle bag

B	no
A	the colours?
B	it's just from the wax when it's um
A	uh-huh

A	fourteen
B	nineteen by fourteen
A	ah it smells so good
B	it's nice isn't it
A	mhm
B	and you buy one moisturizer
A	mhm
B	you
A	mhm
B	the paper bag's gonna work out cheaper
A	if I were you I'd keep the cotton bags for the the samples you send out to people that you want to be making orders with you
B	and the candle
A	and then when people actually buy retail
B	yeah
A	keep them in the paper bags
B	okay
A	mhm
B	or if someone's going into a shop and buying a candle
A	yeah
B	so I either sell it in
A	mm
B	well in which case er they would have tissue to wrap up the products and then one of those jute bags
A	yeah
B	kinda thing in cotton
A	yep
B	tut um
A	not not stuff that looks cheap
B	tissue paper
A	that costs less
B	mm
A	or
B	no I just want plain white really with probably just plain white tissue
A	yeah
B	and then on my Dymo I've got labels that big I print off with Honest on
A	uh-huh
B	they're like that big
A	yeah
B	so the
A	yeah um yeah
B	put a sticker on and put it in the bag
A	yeah
B	Cos especially cos some of them are glass and some are plastic
A	Good idea
B	so in which case cotton bags
A	are you sure you can't find them cheaper on er other sites?
B	tut yeah oh babe honestly I've done so much research with these guys
A	uh-huh
B	but you can get
A	mm
B	and some of them were like really cheap
A	yeah
B	like looking
A	oh you don't want cheap looking
B	see they do backpacks as well look
B	I dunno
A	uh
B	oh gosh
A	how many millimetres does it say?
B	oh yeah
A	it's forty-five by thirty
B	five pounds twenty for ten
A	oh okay
B	so salons will buy a pack of bags
A	uh-huh
B	if they want them
A	right
B	do you know what I mean?
A	yeah
B	otherwise if not then I'll just give them tissue paper
A	mhm
B	and they'll the clients will put it in the bag or whatever
A	yep
B	and then my stamp's not
A	by thirty
B	that's enough for like a couple of products isn't it?
A	yeah
B	Cos the next size up then is three hundred by
A	unless you buy the backpacks
B	four fifty
A	they're cool
B	which is like that big
A	yeah
B	which is way too big
A	no that's too big
B	well no people everyone walking round with Honest
A	that's the aim
B	well this is perfect
A	oh yeah
B	in fact I really like this bag
A	but it'll be difficult to stamp it won't it
B	it's like I
A	then again
B	but you know like potato bags?
A	yeah
B	you buy your potatoes in
A	well you could huh
B	I don't know which ones I prefer
A	do you definitely wanna stamp the bag with the logo?
B	yeah
A	but you definitely want the logo on the bag?
B	oh yeah
A	but will you be able to get er a logo on that bag? Cos it's quite rough material isn't it
B	tut it's
B	do you know what I mean? Like if I had a bag like that I'd reuse it for in my bathroom or something
A	yeah
B	I don't know
A	uh
B	which one do you prefer?
A	come here
B	yeah
A	but
B	mm
A	I mean there's
B	mm
A	no reason why you couldn't maybe get some of this material
B	oh God babe
B	um
A	can give your nan something to do
A	nan
B	I think they're the same price
A	they are lovely though
B	yeah
A	they both say the same thing
B	yeah
A	nice and pure
A	mhm
B	you know a scrub or in actual fact if someone buys a scrub and they're in these these are gonna be loads better aren't they
A	yeah
B	Cos that's a scrub in there
A	yeah
B	it's gonna be
A	well in that case you're definitely gonna want a bag that's more heavy-duty so that especially well if it's in a
B	in fact
A	quite well
B	I know this isn't full and it's not got salt in but this is just oil
A	uh-huh
B	so with salt in as well or sugar it's gonna be even heavier
A	yeah
B	um put that in the bag
A	let's see how it feels
B	mm
A	people buy two glass things
B	yeah
A	lovely
B	yeah
A	okay
B	so that's a decision made
A	yeah
B	I think it's quite nice
A	they do complement each other as well
B	so the size of that one is thirty-five
A	so how much are those?
B	they are
A	yeah that's what it was
B	well that's
A	how big is it? Thirty? What was it?
B	er
A	uh-huh
B	that way
A	three fifty by
B	twenty
A	twenty-two
B	two hundred and sixty
A	isn't it two twenty-six? Cos it's twenty
B	yeah
A	six
B	but two hundred and sixty millimetres that is isn't it
A	isn't it two hundred and twenty-six? How many centimetres is it?
B	it's um tut twenty-six
A	okay
B	so it's two hundred and sixty
A	two hundred and sixty millimetres
B	no
A	very bizarre
B	mm
A	let's see
B	ah
A	that's definitely not
B	uh
A	how very weird
B	um they are five ten for ten no four eighty-five for ten
A	that's okay
B	which is cheaper than the smaller ones
A	yeah
B	large jute bag which I've got in there is seven ten for ten
A	well maybe they're in the medium size one maybe they're talking about the one that you were calling large?
B	yeah
A	Cos other er
B	this is the large
A	oh that is very large isn't it
B	well that would be nearly five hundred by
A	five hundred
B	five hundred mil by three hundred mil
A	mil
B	mil
A	five hundred by three hundred
B	four hundred by five hundred
A	how bizarre
B	really bizarre
A	maybe they've just sent you a different cos that actually looks a bit darker than these ones
B	no it's the same
A	very strange
B	let me see what their small one is
A	have you got a small one here?
B	I've got that
A	er but are they?
B	oh no
A	are they the same sizes? The different
B	well he said because I wanted all of them he said he sent me a bit of both
A	oh okay
B	um
A	what's he done?
B	so there's a smaller one
A	hm
B	but I think that's the way to go
A	well it's just a rough idea of the price anyway
B	well what I'll do is I'll wait till my stamp arrives
A	did you order the stamp already?
B	no
A	how long will it take to arrive?
B	tut um
A	or don't you know?
B	probably have it by next week
