A	International Corpus you've decided to help them out
B	yeah erm
A	I'm
A	I've signed up for the erm
B	oh yeah that
A	just to add to my
B	that's the the the repeat
A	it's the repeat
B	of the one that I signed up for and never carried on with yeah
A	yeah I'm going to I'm going to maybe not do all of it but look at some of it
B	the first week or two is is quite straightforward cos you just watch a video and they they make sure it's all bite size and you and you click when something is done it gives you a great feeling you've you click through all these things but then it starts getting more demanding
A	after a bit yeah
B	the problem
A	so what other grievances oh yes oh I had you know the
B	yes
A	they were quite tricky
B	yes
A	do you remember?
B	I do er
A	er
B	their kind of tutor their course tutor?
A	yeah and she said I need to speak to you so I said okay so from the email I thought well it's going to be something negative
B	oh your transcriptions?
A	I had got them to do some work on the
B	well they agreed
A	they agreed and they all so they seemed happy enough anyway
B	oh
A	and erm
B	that's unexpected after the last session
B	they nearly
A	well they were not they weren't great were they? anyway
B	I thought that it was very French I mean that's what I I told told you when you told me about the riots and how the kids upturned the cars
A	mm
B	I thought this I liked this about France they they can say what they feel
A	yeah they're very
A	the opposite of what the experience I had here
B	mm
A	and the oh
B	so you went along
A	she said yes erm
B	yeah and why didn't they tell you anyway?
A	cos I got this CV idea from you the video CV
B	can't remember
A	you film yourself doing sort of presentation well it
B	somebody else but
A	anyway
B	a good idea yeah
A	I said oh well okay and er
B	mm
A	and then so I sent them that
B	mm
A	and the feedback that I got was absolutely lovely they said we really appreciated it
B	oh
A	cos it's not at all their style to sort of say that they like things when they don't
B	no cos they
A	they said
B	no no
A	we really like doing the workshops
B	mm
A	erm one guy said I don't usually like English but as you let you let us a lot of you let us have a lot of freedom and
B	it wouldn't work with them would it?
A	no
B	they'd just rebel
A	and I got really nice and the last after you left we went to the to the pub with some of them and I gave them all my second hand books that I don't want anymore and they were really touched by that
B	mm
A	and they said I'm reading er I'm reading some of the books you gave us and
B	you mean novels or what?
A	novels yeah
B	but did you make this woman read the feedback? did you
A	no cos she doesn't read English she doesn't speak English she's always going on about how
B	well I reckon it would be worth translating that feedback
A	thought so it made me feel pretty low
B	mm
A	end of term and then I got this criticism and I was thinking oh no and then I got the feedback from those students which was really nice which really cheered me up
B	yeah but it makes you wonder where did she where is she coming from? where does she get this
A	and also it was interesting you know when you give feedback you usually say one well the the sort of practice is to say one nice thing and then
B	one thing for improvement say
A	and she didn't say she went straight into you know
B	I think you've gotta be quite clever to manage that group because it's a it's quite a large group and they're not linguists they're IT so they don't perceive language to be necessarily the most useful thing for them
A	mm
B	and so if you can manage that
A	so I'm a bit I'm sort of erm a bit fed up with er
B	mm
B	yes
A	but I could imagine it's erm the same anywhere
B	within reason I think that's I think that's true but I
A	thank you
B	I once worked in erm
A	thanks
A	mm
B	and so he would delegate decisions
A	mm
B	so you felt involved I think
A	mm
B	you felt that it was a kind of more a flatter organisation
A	mm
A	yeah
B	mm
A	and erm I got a bill for two hundred and eighty a week
B	but that's erm you should be paying less not more if it's pull up shouldn't you? more like a studio
A	well I've got one bed and the pull up before it just had
B	well why don't you ask them to change to er the other room?
A	well I asked for a sort of family room for
B	oh that's why
A	for
B	that's why
A	but actually here I'm all on my own
B	is
A	he's gone off cycling
B	where?
A	but he'll be coming down then
B	oh
A	no he he
B	oh my gosh that's a lot
A	well three weeks
B	gosh
A	erm
B	why couldn't you okay why don't you negotiate with them and erm
A	next week
B	for one week or?
A	every other night
[ANNOTATION]	Person A want to ask something about other days in the week for nights	Neutral
B	oh I see you why every other night? that'll
A	because
A	my my brother
B	oh
A	yeah
B	so that's the deal
[ANNOTATION]	Person B confirm what Person A said	Neutral
A	look after him when
B	that's annoying because erm
A	well they are this week
B	then you could go into a smaller room
A	mm
B	save some money and then move back into the family room
A	mm
B	yeah
A	but it's got a slide it's you know it's those beds that fit underneath you know?
[ANNOTATION]	Person A think Person b is a great pianist	Contradiction
B	yeah but they obviously make a well ask them
A	I will I feel a bit embarrassed cos I got given the bill
B	your jaw dropped
A	and then I went off
A	I didn't take it in and then I spoke to my mother and she's last
B	what?
[ANNOTATION]	Person B got surprised because of the thing that Person A said	Entailment
A	ah you how are you gonna pay for that? and I was like I don't know she no
B	well except it isn't
A	well it would be a hundred a night if I was staying in a hotel
B	mm
A	thirty-seven
B	thirty-seven that's good
A	so it's still quite cheap isn't it?
B	yeah I mean it's cheaper than er
[ANNOTATION]	Person B agree with Person A that the price is cheap	Entailment
A	Holiday Inn?
B	no but it's one like that
B	similar
A	Premier Inn?
B	yeah Premier
B	Premier that one
A	so
B	that's quite cheap
A	the thing is a did get you know I pestered them to have that room with
B	oh I see
A	so I don't feel I want to sort of quibble now about
B	no but you could er you could ask rather than quibble
A	mm
B	I mean it could be a question
A	so I could say
B	can I check something?
A	mm
B	that's like how it was originally put it
A	I was surprised at the figure cos it was I have to go back to my old emails or
B	well
A	it was
B	well you wouldn't think would you because you you've stayed there only last year
A	well not last year er
B	oh yes it is only a few months ago
B	well there you are
A	feels like a year ago
B	yeah
A	so I'm gonna go back and see how much I've paid and say you know
B	mm
A	and
B	no I think that's perfectly reasonable
A	it could be yeah
B	I was gonna say that one of the erm
A	mm
B	but
A	mm
B	so
A	what's happened about that? have they
B	yeah they've taken the same staff on I think the existing ones are supposed to be more or less under the same conditions but all the new ones presumably under worse conditions and also
A	mm
B	and so he got a he didn't get his he didn't submit his PhD on time and now he's in overtime you know when you pay
A	continuous?
B	yeah so he pays a low fee but
A	a continuation
B	yeah so he's looking very sorry and
A	I didn't know you had researchers at the end you've got a study room have you at the end of your corridor?
B	on the right hand side opposite the language study room is the researchers' room
A	mm
B	for the philosophy students
A	philosopher
B	yeah
A	philosophy
B	yeah
A	mm
B	he's got some teaching coming up
A	mm
B	don't think he he's
A	I was thinking maybe I could do some work
B	no and what could you do anyway?
A	mm
B	well you could just be teaching and go and see erm
A	mm mm
B	and offer to
B	and erm do some teaching cover
A	mm
B	I think that was
A	cover?
B	but
A	for people who are sick
B	yeah but if two people were sick
A	yeah
B	or there might be some development work to do you could offer to erm
A	mm uhu I'll have a think I'll have a look at my finances
B	I think that's the
A	mm
B	you could try the library by the way
A	oh right
B	like vacuuming books
B	cos yeah they did that all last summer it was horrible
A	oh yeah I tell you what after spending three weeks with my in laws I when I go back to
B	oh no
A	they live
B	why?
A	there are piles of paper every Guardian that they get and they get it every day they don't they keep they keep
B	every garden they? garden?
A	every Guardian
B	Guardian
A	paper newspaper
B	yeah
A	like ten piles of Guardians nearly like this high
B	what does that say about
B	I thought you can
A	it's really bonkers
B	which they are going to repair one day
A	so I'd say do you want to keep this? they've got three or four of everything as well
B	no
A	no no no no no anything you show them a piece of dirty tissue almost shall I throw this away?
B	no recycle
A	no no no which all the erm cereal packets all the egg cartons
B	when when you started that I thought you were gonna say they were hyper organised and hyper and so you were shamed into thinking you must tidy up at
A	no well this made me think like I'm gonna
B	but nothing like that nothing like you what you described in
A	no
A	it's so serious
B	cos people do get more untidy as they get older anyway
A	do they?
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b has a grandma	Neutral
B	well I think so I read about well Iris Murdoch and her husband
B	and they had bottles everywhere
A	there's not a table top there's not a table top free
B	mm
A	er also to add to that there's mice scuttering around and pooing everywhere
B	oh
B	well
A	it's really really serious
B	well it's a
A	I felt quite sick and I'm I'm quite glad I came away alive and
B	you didn't get sick?
A	I got sick a bit actually yeah
B	oh gosh
A	they
B	how old are they?
A	er
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a loves rats	Contradiction
B	eighty-seven?
A	so they said we we were bullying them
B	we used to do the same with my mum I think my brother had a go at reorganising tidying things and er her response I think was she may have accepted when he did it but when I tried to it was very much very similar very defensive so I'd feel that I was
A	mm yeah I did stop eventually cos it it's it's not a it's not something you particularly want to do is cleaning I don't particularly get much joy
B	mm
B	mm
A	but er anyway
B	are they erm in good health or
A	er well for their age
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b has two brothers	Neutral
B	yeah you mentioned the crutches
A	to
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a has no health issues	Neutral
A	have a clear
A	well
B	well what if there's a fire or something?
A	oh
B	actually the
A	oh my gosh
B	more reason why there should be a fire with all the Guardians piled up
A	but I I'm interested in this erm
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b is concerned in case there's a fire	Entailment
B	mm
A	what why? why?
B	it's called old age
A	I realised though when I was at er a meeting I used
B	mm
A	because some somebody there was some teacher was moaning about a student you know these these Miage students they do two weeks at university and two weeks in a company?
B	company yeah
A	anyway one of these guys well who well you never saw and nor did I he never turns up
[ANNOTATION]	they are college professors	Neutral
B	oh
A	apparently at his at his job his IT job they're really happy with him and want to keep him on
B	mm
A	but he doesn't come to any of the courses at uni so the teachers were going oh
B	well that's the same use isn't it?
A	it's not because one woman looked at me as I started and she went
B	well
A	the the dichotomy between all the contradiction
A	you know or that's an interesting you know contradiction or something and
B	oh
A	it's interesting either
B	oh
A	benefit
A	yeah
B	one of the actors says so the oh
A	well I suppose in a beginner French something maybe
B	oh
A	if it's in English you can't say that price is interesting
B	no
A	you go well there's nothing interesting about that price
A	but in French it really means
B	value
A	there's a value it's it's valuable
B	oh
A	so when she
B	right
A	when I said it and I or I immediately realised my error but I then I thought I can't
B	oh
A	well I can't go on and say well the meaning in England I'm sorry I've misused the term so they were absolutely horrified
B	of course
B	so it's related to the English sense of interest like the interest on something
A	yes
B	yes
A	yes
B	mm
A	but I'd used it wrongly in this
A	it's not what I meant to say and what I meant to say that it was it it was in the English sense
B	yeah curious or
A	curious
B	yeah
A	of how he could be so different how
A	you know in ones milieu he was really appreciated and the other you know
B	yeah
A	detested by
B	I
B	I didn't
A	they all looked at me or after getting my bad feedback and then
B	the outcast
A	how can
B	a paragon
B	I didn't realise they were supposed to be spending two weeks in either in both base level they were doing both at once or something
A	two weeks on two weeks it's two weeks on and two weeks off
B	oh
A	yeah
B	cos they weren't coming to uni everyday were they? it was just two days a week or two like erm
A	no yeah every day for two weeks
B	oh but the rest of the time they were doing other things other classes?
A	yeah mm
B	oh okay
A	so er
B	like IT mm
A	I thought that was very interesting
A	how I'd made that error
B	mm
A	because I've been you know thinking in English
B	coming back on yeah
A	than French and I I find I do that in both languages and get misunderstood
B	but last last time we talked I don't mean er I mean back in April
A	er I'd taken a decision?
B	almost it was almost conscious or you well you were aware let's say you were self aware you were seemed to recognise that
A	well maybe
B	you were going into that mode or role
A	well er yeah
B	not surprising it
A	especially when I get a lot of erm
B	but that's that would happen anywhere I think
A	what? even if I was living in England?
B	to an extent
A	oh right
B	all of us and that could have
A	yeah I think some of it's more that it's informal it's er she says it's
B	cos I just went through a colleague's erm it's called a scholarly piece for her PG cert at HE and they were just said you they were just personality they were just habit
A	mm
B	er I was
A	mm
B	noticing
A	oh I think it's quite busy compared to last August
B	do you?
A	yeah could be really quiet at night time
B	oh
A	it's really quiet
B	yeah of course you know there's this summer at
A	oh yeah
B	physics or oh
A	last year when I was at
B	what partying and sort of
A	partying and really drunk
B	probably
A	students
B	they seem very young
A	are you working for the whole of August?
B	yeah but
A	and then straight into the new term?
B	no there's two weeks I have two weeks erm what's called erm
A	oh
B	well I'm going to Toulouse for
A	oh
B	three days
A	three days?
B	I decided that's all I could afford well you know the
A	yeah
B	that that they go Gatwick to Strasbourg as well
A	uhu
B	and maybe I was wrong but erm
A	alright you alright
B	it's it's a single room it's the same idea you know gosh erm if you were two people it would cost more or less the same
A	mm
B	it's just breakfast is more
A	mm
B	erm
A	mm
B	so going there
A	for three days
B	yeah
A	what are you going to do just
B	three or four days
A	walk around the town or?
B	well it's got er the Michelin guide it's got three stars or something so
A	mm
B	erm all sorts of places of interest around Toulouse
A	mm well it's quite big I've been to Toulouse
B	bit like Bristol isn't it I suppose? aero aero industries
A	mm yeah it's nice it's it nice huge sort of erm
B	oh what the cathedral?
A	just in the centre yeah
B	oh it sounds a bit like erm
A	mm mm
B	well I suppose most French cities
A	mm
B	are like that
A	oh well that's good
B	yeah and the rest of the time I'm going to
A	mm
B	just the odd day to get ready for and then a week before the new term term starts
A	er
B	oh yeah resits
A	resits and erm
A	so I'm not gonna be there
B	gosh what did your but you won't be timetabled will you for
A	I have been timetabled
B	for that day?
A	yes so I've got to now say sorry I'm not like gonna be there
B	so
A	and then August as everybody just
B	nobody's there yeah
A	everything's shut it's shut
B	but hang on this is the twenty-sixth of August
A	mm
B	so it's legitimate for you not to be there because nobody is anyway in France
A	yes
B	in August
A	it's criminal to
B	yes
B	who is this person?
A	another person who organises Miage
B	oh
A	well for the student who never
B	oh is that what it is? yeah
A	it's for this same person
B	it's yeah
A	er so I've got to
B	so it has to be you really because you're the one who was teaching that group
A	yeah but I'm always a bit worried you know when you don't get a response to your email so I think oh the you know
B	have you clicked the red exclamation mark for important?
A	no I never I've never done that before
B	oh
A	well I'll do the I'll send them another one
B	yeah because if when he comes back
A	mm
B	it might him several days to reach it
A	mm that's true
B	no
A	considering how bad
B	why don't you take them some Cadbury's what do you call those things? erm assortment things
A	I've tried that approach with gifts and things
B	doesn't it work?
A	postcards gifts
B	it er looks very
A	you're buying your friends
B	yeah well it looks very much like a peace offering but erm it wouldn't do any harm would it?
A	no
B	er especially if you're going to be a day
A	oh they're different they're different people
B	yeah
A	it's not the same
B	no I think you could because erm
A	bribe them
B	you've been away three weeks so it's like er people do don't they when they've been on holiday
A	well
B	yes in your room
A	yeah he edited my French article
B	oh yeah?
A	cos he's very good at French
B	mm
A	so he
B	in the meeting?
A	just afterwards
B	oh I see he means
A	I don't know
B	and I'm sure it's a
A	so I and he and then he phoned me up in the evening to
B	oh maybe he wasn't meaning I see yeah
A	so maybe he thought I was being sort of rebellious sort of thing
B	oh no maybe he meant that there should be a rebellion
A	I don't know anyway he was very kind and
B	yeah
A	he's been kind by you know doing this
B	yeah
A	very kindly so
B	put this off
A	is that enough time?
