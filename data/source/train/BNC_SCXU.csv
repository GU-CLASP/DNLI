A	mm yeah I guess it's busy
B	yes indeed
A	okay
B	right do you like to put of your music on?
A	my music?
A	it's in the in my bag in the back
B	okay
A	like
B	I did actually discuss this with you a few days ago that I said
A	when?
B	or we can
A	no but doesn't have any of
B	that's what your entire music collection right?
A	yeah okay well I'll
B	I'm sure there is something in there that's good to listen to in the car
A	oh there's lots of things that are good to listen to in the car
A	yeah yeah well
B	well we didn't have a facility to connect an iPod to a car at the time
A	did we not?
B	no
A	okay
B	we only got this connecter after I got this iPod which means that for obvious reasons
A	oh
B	er
A	er
B	I don't know let's er I think it's on the shuffle at the moment
A	yeah sure
B	yes
A	it doesn't seem to be picking it up
B	is it meant to be plugged in?
A	it was but I'll just re un unplug it and reconnect it
B	okay
A	ah it's erm it's frozen
B	your mum's frozen
B	no
A	yeah
B	oh well the latest M P G was coming at fifty-two
A	that's pretty good yeah
B	well we're normally on sixty-two so whether that's actually it because I think that's a lot of
A	yes
B	wait roundabout
B	yes indeed
A	yeah
B	strategic
A	ah ha
B	I will quite happily undertake on this section because I'm not actually in contact with the road
A	yeah yeah
B	exactly
A	pretty good that
B	yeah
A	nice one
B	maybe I'm bored
A	yeah
B	the thing is though generally used by appalling drivers
A	yeah no exactly yeah
B	people sort of would would tail gate you themselves were it not for
A	yeah
B	no no what I meant was that the people
A	yes
B	yeah but that's a joke because of the other ones
A	yeah exactly that's what I mean
B	the one that really annoys me
A	ah
B	are they
A	is she little? Or is she obese? Be honest
A	yeah or picking a very safe vehicle or
B	well no it's the
A	giving the responsibility to other people
B	yeah
A	oh no definitely
B	yeah
A	I think
B	maybe tomorrow we'll see
A	yeah I was going to say if you erm and you can er yeah these stretches will
B	I'm still going to be  of that parallel park
A	yeah it was good stuff
B	so it was a tiny space up a hill and a really bad angle
A	you did it first time
B	yeah
A	we can do a bit of shuffle on mine and
B	yeah
A	bit more of a mixed bag
B	that's in shuffle of
A	no I just mean erm like oh how do you
B	oh it shouldn't do
A	yeah that's
B	so I'm doing it on my Christmas music for example
A	yeah I'll have to do that with er with that
B	well also unusually for all your  it saves from location
A	yes
B	if you could get all albums to do that
A	can you?
B	yeah
A	oh right
B	yeah exactly that's why it's a default not to
A	yeah
B	yeah
B	you see when I first got a DVD I was really disconcerted because it didn't save your place
A	yeah yeah
B	but then of course you do have to be  to it
A	yeah the thing is you you were
B	yep
A	we rewound it when we wanted to watch it
B	yep
A	but if you watch something and you've got half way through you know and you
B	yeah you leave it then obviously
A	yeah
B	once you've finished you rewind it
A	huh
B	ah
A	yeah
B	oi
A	nice
B	I've never seen a Hummer Range Rover before
B	sorry a limo Range Rover yes
A	ah it's the same
B	it is just crazy
A	yeah and then it just carried on
B	I was like  I was like  well
A	it was like a weird perspective thing
B	yeah exactly
A	you can see the front and the back but the gap in between was bigger than you thought
B	that must be a custom job
A	mm
B	yes
A	yeah
B	however
A	yeah it's fair to say
B	erm I wouldn't object to one
A	no
B	but if not we can borrow it
B	it's only a two seater though
A	it is
B	I think like I can just imagine see seventy
A	that's pretty cool
B	some beers maybe
A	some beers
B	erm I'm tempted
A	yeah and no cost in terms of leave
B	yeah
A	which is quite valuable
B	yeah
A	yeah just
B	yeah
A	but it's nice to have it so that
B	that's my instinct
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	as proper breaks
B	yeah
A	but if we do need
B	maybe we can go to Alton Towers one day say but
A	yeah yeah exactly
B	but then you don't properly relax
A	yeah
B	well I don't know
A	yeah
B	that car looks weird
A	what the Schirokko?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	I thought it was Schirokko
A	I would say  I would say  say Schirokko
B	okay
A	I don't know I haven't been on any car website in a while
B	I'll do it from the car
A	from the car yeah
B	yeah we could
A	your mum seems determined that we go
B	I know
A	really keen
B	champagne
A	champagne in the hot tub
B	lies in
A	pardon?
B	lies in
A	lies in yeah
B	yes
A	that will be nice
B	board games
A	board games
A	yeah and erm just yeah
B	maybe pop down the gym and do some weights
A	yeah
B	no that sounds a great plan
A	cool
B	or we could consider to have them over
A	yeah I'll mention that to them
B	it's not that far
A	no
B	another thought is
A	what? Yeah it's erm you mean the hotel?
B	yeah
A	yeah it's fifteen
B	oh well
A	yeah it's a shame but never mind
B	no that won't do bugger all because they're a national chain
A	no
B	okay
A	and through the website
B	yeah
A	you know
B	bit difficult for them to regulate that
A	yeah
B	so Dad likes the new gym
A	but they can't
A	and and he likes
B	yeah
A	Good
B	yeah
A	what's a wall angel? I I was asking you both of you for like a
B	sorry erm
A	yeah I was going what's the wall angel
B	I'll show you in
A	okay
B	who's singing this?
A	can't remember
B	oh no it's from the er er
[ANNOTATION]	Person B couldn't remember the thing	Neutral
B	erm what was I saying? Erm yeah I've never seen Dad so happy I don't think
A	what last night? He was enjoying himself
B	not to start with and didn't really change throughout the evening
A	no no
B	but we I can't believe
A	so bad
B	that was ridiculous
[ANNOTATION]	Person B think it is unbelievable	Entailment
A	oh my word
A	huh
B	I think retirement suits him
A	yes I think he does
B	I think it's a combination of but he's now retired and very very relaxed
A	yeah
B	and the fact that we no longer live together and you two get on very well
A	yes
B	exactly
A	Dearie me
[ANNOTATION]	Person A is going to have a sandwich	Contradiction
B	I think it's it's nearest to the ideal if we just pop up occasionally
A	yes I think he's getting better at just going oh they're here
B	I'm going to  so there
A	yeah
B	possibly but he still doesn't want to get into a car
A	no
B	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Person B said he doesnt want to get in the car	Neutral
A	true
B	possibly
A	in his head it's never worth it and then he gets there and goes no it's alright really
B	next door's baby sounds lovely though
A	your mum's like obsessed with her baby
B	yeah it's scary isn't it?
B	she's right though she doesn't sort of like make a thing about children
A	well I'm
[ANNOTATION]	Person A is not sure that Person B said she doesnt like to make the things about the children	Entailment
B	I think we have a very common attitude to children like some babies I find actually that's quite cute
A	but a bit too small really aren't you
B	the thing that really annoys me is like it's unacceptable to take a dog into a restaurant but acceptable to tale a baby in
A	yeah
B	my dog's far more hygienic than a baby
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	it depends on the dog but then if you have sort of
B	it will lie under the table and be quiet
A	yeah
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	I think he'd really enjoy it
B	exactly
A	yeah
B	possibly yes
A	it's interesting isn't it?
B	he's very good at picking up on that
A	he's extremely good yeah
B	well he can also sniff out drugs a lot more effectively than you can
A	yeah
B	or better about doing something about it which is always what amuses me
A	yes
B	er what am I talking about?
A	but erm talking about Sandy and dogs and how much he understands and going away to
B	oh yes about just about Dad and enjoying last night
A	oh yes
B	yes
A	yeah
B	dessert was the best bit
A	yeah
B	like the starter was a bit sort of
A	I I was so hungry though that I didn't really
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	I mean that was my only comment
A	my main course was lovely but I think you maybe yours was maybe more standard
B	but no it's just a bit
A	oh it's a shame
B	it was like a pizza base with the ingredients thrown on top
A	right yeah
B	like the food in Pizza Express is several notches above that
A	right okay
B	okay
A	erm I've never had anything quite like that
B	I mean maybe I should think more creatively about what I have next time up there
A	yeah
B	Cos I mean that's the thing
A	it's really good yeah
B	yeah
A	oh I was thinking actually
B	I was actually thinking of possibly going to the cinema at the
A	yeah we could do
B	er so it might be fun
A	what and?
B	Cos the alternative is to go back by the M11 but I think that will be slower
A	are we going to see a film? Or just getting some food or?
B	I said go to the cinema
A	yeah
B	yeah I originally well just for
A	yeah
B	right erm
A	just literally go and see a film or go and have some food or? I mean in some ways it might be nice to get back seeming as we've sort of been out
B	I don't know
A	yeah okay
B	I'm not sure
A	I'm not  I'm not  sure what's out at the minute
B	I was going to check this morning but we didn't really have time
A	yeah
B	right
A	and erm they used the music from The Artist for one of the tasks and it just really annoyed me
B	the what? That rancid shit
A	what?
B	the Apprentice
A	the Apprentice
B	like what?
A	well just the way they approach
B	problems
A	yeah like this this the first task there was sixteen people so you didn't really get to know them
B	right
A	erm and make a
B	well my solution would be I'm going to accept all of us now to work at our regular jobs for this period of time
A	huh
B	and we'll earn far more money
A	I don't think you'd win The Apprentice that way but yeah good thinking
B	well it's a pointless task because cos they'll either know nothing about
A	oh yeah
B	probably quite effective
A	well they wanted to sell them for fifteen quid for these tiny little teddy bears and it's like oh that's not going to work
B	right?
A	I'm sorry no it was a bus
B	yeah but many things don't mean anything
A	yeah I know but it was just a ridiculously bad
B	that's a very small door
A	yeah
B	I think so
A	how bizarre
B	the others could be inside
A	true yeah
B	that's obviously quite an expensive bike
A	mm
B	if you have a look at it
A	yeah
B	it says caution on the back
A	left hand drive
B	oh
A	ah
A	english registration but how bizarre
B	maybe
A	you never know
B	yeah
A	it had like a sticker of that on the petrol cover thing
B	how unfortunate
A	yeah
B	ha
A	oh dearie me
B	like what?
A	well just the some of the cliché they come out with and I'm trying to think of a good example of one
A	yeah well yeah exactly
B	but in effect they don't realise this is the thing
A	yeah exactly
B	mm
A	not as good as MasterChef
B	what is it? Hitler's chickens
A	hit list yeah
B	no Hitler's
A	oh Hitler's chickens
B	look how we now gained three lanes
A	yeah
B	it's weird
B	however
A	they obviously think
B	you can always fly dear
A	ah bless
B	I really don't want to go home and work again
A	yeah
B	that's something I'm gonna bring up in my
A	well that's great I mean go in with things to to bring up
B	yes
A	like it shows you've thought about it
B	as in what I'm doing more or less is having a project to work on and having something sort of
A	right
B	I also think I've possible the last month or so I think I've been quite tired
A	okay
B	and it's difficult therefore to put any enthusiasm into it which makes it worse
A	yeah
B	erm it's a little bit self-reinforcing
A	yeah
B	but and I've got I love having
A	yes
B	so at least I saw clients and I went to client sites
A	yeah
B	and I really enjoyed that and I haven't done that since
A	right
B	and cos I find like bizarrely bizarrely I find sort of monthly team meeting really interesting and really motivational
A	yeah yeah
B	and I can see what I'm doing in the wider context
A	yes definitely
B	and I've had less of that which has been de-motivating
A	okay so so you'd really yeah I mean you could say you'd really like to spend more time in client meetings and meetings and things
B	well no not really
A	true
A	yeah
B	you see most people hate driving to work and I still love it
A	yeah yeah
B	I actively enjoy the process
A	well yeah maybe worth mentioning then that you like travelling and
B	er yeah I think so
A	okay
B	which is interesting in fact because I always assumed you call it financial year end but er apparently not
A	mm
B	oh well we'll see
A	yeah so well it will be a good chance and yeah erm bring up everything I guess
B	yes I intend to
A	make a list
B	what?
A	this music
B	ah
A	so
B	right
A	so which is why it sounds exciting and sort of makes you feel a little bit
B	well it wouldn't always have been iconic
A	hmm?
B	it wasn't always have been iconic
A	no
B	I wouldn't mind watching Mission Impossible twoI
A	erm
B	I like bits of it
A	I'm not sure
B	no that's Mission Impossible one
A	that's Mission
B	er masks and a train
A	oh god yeah
B	and that's
A	hmm
B	mental note
A	yes
B	Cos you suddenly put yourself in their blind spot and they're not expecting you
A	hmm
B	however
A	no
B	yes
A	ah busy
B	yes
A	yeah
B	that's special in that case
A	yeah
B	that wasn't that bad if you were just getting out into lane
A	huh
B	so interestingly legally
A	because he was undertaking right
B	yeah because that would have been driving without due care and attention
A	right
B	because undertaking is actually illegal
A	yes
B	erm well at least not specifically
A	yeah
B	oh
A	wow
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	well you've now got everything now haven't you?
A	yeah
B	I have a lot
A	true I'll stick everything you've got on it cos then we can play it through the dock and all of the audio books
B	well no I still like mine on the dock thank you very much
A	no
B	no we didn't
A	oh right
B	I still want my music collection on my iPod
A	fair enough
B	otherwise what's the point in mine
A	fair enough
B	I'm not sure
A	oh
B	those boys don't understand the average speed limit
A	no
A	but erm yeah what was I going to say erm? Oh I just thought oh yeah that was it Crooked House I think it was
B	I like it cos you can watch with your eyes shut
A	yes
B	I still really want to go to Lego Land
A	let's go some time
B	I'm not sure that's acceptable
A	you can just go
B	are you?
A	yeah
B	right
A	so yeah if you want to go to Alton Towers
B	yeah
A	ah
B	I think it was unfortunately it was relatively short lived
A	yeah
B	which is possibly as well
A	yeah
B	the best one was either the one in the taxi or the land economy one
A	I think my favourite was still the one  walking to King's with the card
B	oh yes
A	and
B	Boromir related humour
A	yeah
B	uh?
A	huh
B	okay let's get past you
A	ah
B	what?
A	I presume it's Canned Heat
B	who by?
A	jamiroquai
B	is it?
A	yeah
B	okay
A	we can skip it if you don't like it
B	no
A	I quite like Jamiroquai
B	this must be one of my running songs
A	oh right
B	well as far as things go
A	true true
B	it's busy
A	it is
B	we actually agree on this
A	I'm glad we both recognise the factual statement is true
B	I'm glad we both appreciate the traffic density for what it is
A	dense
B	dense like your mother
A	ah
B	just like your mum's face
A	ah
B	see what I did there?
A	I do yes
B	yeah should be fun
A	yeah it's really nice
B	flirt
A	no not particularly
A	I think that will be a very very bad idea
B	what?
A	Heather is there
B	I think that will be utterly hilarious
B	right
A	erm she was  she was  like you know I was really upset when we you know we were talking about this in a bus stop and I was like I'm crying in public
B	yeah
A	so she was annoyed for being
B	yes
A	but erm yeah I suppose so
B	right just make sure you take full opportunity with the fact she's living in your house and working underneath you to boss her about
A	yeah definitely
B	as in if the opportunity rises you boss
A	oh yeah definitely
B	you are actually her boss
A	no no I am no
B	oh
A	but erm yeah no what I'm going to do is I'm not I'm going to make her think things through
B	give her all the shit jobs
A	well actually I've got a quite a nice timetable for her but I'm I'm gonna make her think things through for herself
B	yeah
A	and and just try and get her into that way of thinking
B	yeah
A	and keep me updated on your progress and yeah
B	well to fair I'm never going to start on the first thing finish it and then the next thing
A	well no but there there very much ongoing tasks
B	ah
A	and so I mean yeah some of them won't be finishable
B	I have no idea what this song is
A	erm it's probably from that running CD
B	yeah I I
A	I I can't remember what it was called
B	oh good
A	erm yeah I'm quite looking forward to it
B	oo
A	what?
B	the guy ahead just swerved manically
A	I missed that
B	oh dear
A	oh dear
B	well at least we now have a washing up monkey
B	at least it's unwise to try
A	hmm?
B	at least it's unwise to try
A	yeah
B	that's a fuck ugly car
A	horrible innit
B	well it looks like a if you look at the sides it's actually a huge saloon car which has been added onto a top which is what amuses me
A	it's not attractive is it
B	you see that at the back
A	yeah I see what you mean yeah that big bit at the back
B	Dodge
B	it's American
A	yeah I was going to say it looked kind of American in style
B	swollen
A	yeah
B	are huge
A	are massive yeah
B	yes well super minis just don't sort of exist in the same way
A	just haven't caught on
B	use your Smart Car
A	huh
B	indeed
A	tiny and cute
A	no
B	feeder?
B	oh this would be in your CD player?
A	yeah well I had a diskman and I had a case for it that you could put six CDs in the front and zip
B	yeah
A	so erm so yeah you could take seven away with you and so you had to pick carefully
B	oh dear
A	what?
A	yeah a bit unfortunate
B	yeah I was thinking that
A	doesn't look weird it's fine it's you know just not terribly exciting
B	yeah odd that
B	I don't understand how men can drive fast cars
A	they're quite feminine yeah
B	they look nice but they're sort of
A	oh right
B	what? Ubiquitous fairly well earning women's cars then
A	erm
B	yeah they've got these
A	yet and yet you're sort of into so of like I would guarantee that I would be able to out drive you in this
B	yeah
A	sort of wasted I guess
B	erm the best driving I've ever seen occurred in a Nissan Micra
A	yeah
B	it's not the car it's how it's driven
A	but who was that?
B	erm to some extent but often it is so often limited by the road and the traffic conditions so yeah
A	yeah
B	no what you need to be able to do is interact with traffic and read the road conditions
A	yeah
B	mm
A	are they?
B	which
A	oh okay
B	yeah they are huge
A	oh right okay
B	erm which makes
A	huh
B	I E they're not very good for driving around a town centre
A	right
B	they've got appalling turning circles there
A	yes
B	well on a motorway or an autobahn yes
A	yeah
B	that's what I would really like
A	what mental engine in a very small car
B	they're going to produce it as a rival for the M3
A	okay
B	except it's four wheel drive and more powerful and smaller and bright blue
A	right
B	it's very Volvo
A	yeah
B	it's Volvo do nutty car
B	well it's not mental
A	right
B	but they had a feature on the record attempt in
A	yeah
B	and he was basically saying that I mean cos I mean of yeah it was really interesting cos they've got like the reporter went round with him for the first few laps
A	right
B	and he'd like never done it before but he already got like a time which experienced people doing it a 911 would have been pleased with in the first attempt
A	nice
B	in an unfamiliar car
A	huh
B	with a reporter on board
A	right
B	yeah
A	told the report to take his clothes off
B	erm
A	oh dear
B	but yeah that was er
A	no that's cool
B	but it was interesting that he apparently just had like
A	what the test driver?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	he was very Swedish about the whole thing
A	ah
B	no no
A	oh okay
B	bless
A	it is rather unfortunate the erm the CEO of Volvo being German pronounces it Wolwo
B	which is quite ironic that they know Volvo's biggest rivals are the German's
A	yeah
B	can you open that
A	yeah sure
B	anyway but er I
A	I can see you being CEO of Volvo
B	I can't
A	no
B	I can see me being chief engineer
A	ah true yes
B	they wouldn't pay you very well
A	yeah
B	I have seriously considered working for them though
B	well no I am
A	right
B	I I have seriously considered working for them but I think you have to be really quite good
A	yeah oh I'm sure you would really love it
B	erm not necessarily although probably
A	ah
B	well I have objections to living in China
A	yeah
B	mainly because they actually you know kill people
A	do they?
B	no
A	yeah
B	yes
A	yeah
B	er
A	everyone hates you for it
B	well it does raise questions as to what can the state do? Because
A	you mean the idea that that
B	well the Geneva Convention sets out which a lot of countries signed up to
A	right
B	which I find a very strange idea
A	that's bizarre isn't it
B	well no so for example when you capture an enemy soldier you're obliged to  you're obliged to  look after him
A	right
B	you've but he also wasn't obliged to to reveal anything other than his name rank and serial number
A	right
B	erm
A	and presumably torture is
B	yeah specifically if if it's torture
A	yeah
B	erm
A	interrogation no though presumably
B	no in generally
A	yeah
B	er it's a widely ignored now because there aren't any they don't have conventional wars
A	yeah
B	but the last time two sides with equivalent two Western armies
A	right
B	and that was in the fifties
A	yeah
B	it just doesn't happen anymore
A	yeah it's interesting
B	it's funny when in this country how the NHS is like the third biggest employer of the world after the Chinese army and the American army
A	yeah
B	well the American Department of Defense
A	right
B	yeah
A	yeah?
B	I mean their dress uniforms are lovely
A	yeah
B	they're really smart
A	I don't know anything about it really
B	well you see that's my kind of thing
A	mm
B	economically
A	yeah
B	er as in it's almost on a route to overtake China
A	is it?
B	yeah possibly because it's huge
A	India yeah yeah
B	and and you you I I  you'd actually much prefer it to China
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	and there are serious problems with erm kind of caste type issues
B	massive wealth inequality
A	erm but yeah it's probably better than China
B	yeah
A	er I don't know with India I kind of feel I can talk
B	yeah
A	yes
B	but it still seems to be doing quite well for itself as in there's no sort of er er extremist religious groups
A	yeah I mean I'm sure there are problems but less
B	but you look at sort of
A	well quite yeah
B	they no longer
A	yeah as far as I'm concerned yeah
B	oo he's not going to like that much
A	right
B	exactly
A	what? Oh right
B	that BMWs were behaving itself
B	very
A	mm
B	it might be nearly out of fuel
A	yeah true
B	yeah
A	it hasn't gone through completely
B	to be fair yeah
A	yeah
B	oh well there's a new trailer out for it so
A	okay
B	yeah
A	and I wouldn't mind seeing Snow White and the Huntsman now but I'm not sure about the other one
B	oh dear
A	why?
A	yeah
B	so you see that TT
A	oh right
B	no idea
A	okay
B	it's a song that was out a rather iconic song from the first Bourne film
A	oh
B	which I don't think you've seen all of
A	erm
