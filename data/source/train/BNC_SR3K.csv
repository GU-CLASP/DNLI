B	hi welcome to Pandemic Legacy season one with the
D	hi
[ANNOTATION]	None of the speakers is making reference to a disease.	Contradiction

C	and you've got to stick with that voice now for
B	okay
C	for the rest of the
B	oh okay no I I can't do that

D	just popped in to see to see what's going on
B	we're gonna be Americans
C	er there's already a division between the teams
C	oh
A	top secret
C	well look at that
D	show some of it to a camera if you
[ANNOTATION]	Neither of the teams is going to play the Americans.	Contradiction
B	this is top secret
C	erm
B	yes
A	I mean it's a secret
C	wow look at this
B	oh no we're gonna have to
C	whatever can go wrong scars rioting cities wow
B	gonna have to stick things on
A	no we don't need that at the moment I don't think
[ANNOTATION]	The members of all the teams have been decided.	Neutral
C	yeah
A	do we?
C	so dear Pandemic enthusiast we would like first to thank you for acquiring er la-la er we have
A	don't know what any of those things mean
C	no
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A understands all the terms being discussed.	Contradiction
A	alright I think well I
D	this is like an Ikea kitchen er demonstration
B	fuck
A	oh
C	wow
A	wow
B	okay
A	yeah and and
B	I'm guessing we have er we get the world out
B	well
A	and you see the EC there
D	roll the camera
A	it is bigger
B	the world yeah they've grown er
B	they've grown one haven't they?
A	overpopulation
B	yeah that's us that's alright isn't it? you can slide down
A	okay
D	that's
A	so it's the same map as far as far as I can see then the same
B	I think the world is still the same yeah
A	yeah
D	tectonic drift
B	alright
C	yeah yeah
A	got all the big players there Tokyo Leeds
D	any new ones?
B	er am I allowed to be racist in this?
C	erm that's why we've asked you over
B	okay
D	is it any more cities is the same is it?
B	no the same
A	it's the same as far as I can see
B	and if they've only got four diseases
C	so the package eight sticker what does that
A	that'll be that won't it?
B	we're gonna open the er cards for the countries cos I'm assuming we'll need these
A	er if you wanna go rogue at this at any stage
B	so there's only five player cards I'm I'm guessing
A	five
D	uhu no
C	there's more pawns
B	dentist I bet so you can be a medic a generalist a scientist quarantine specialist
D	mm
B	and researcher
D	er
A	cos I thought pawns
D	can I say something you guys?
B	it says only maximum four player
D	this is actually different there's a generalist
B	oh a generalist
D	and there's a service record that you write on on the back
B	you can alter the players
C	oh
A	oh
B	yeah
C	so I'm putting the sticker er it means
A	oh okay
B	so you're putting that on there
A	so you put that on there
B	like maybe like have it on a seal so
D	yeah
C	oh well
A	not gonna open number eight though
C	no and that I think that's what it says it says
B	if you've sealed er seal it
C	er in a frame designed to
A	oh okay
B	what? does it mean
C	I think it means in that
B	so you so you open it don't you like that?
C	yeah in the frame designed for it so
B	yeah so the actual frame yeah
A	there's only eight that's eleven cards er only five epidemic cards
C	so far
B	that's
A	yeah
B	oh yeah yeah good point
D	there are very different
C	top secret dossiers and door forty-two you should remove
B	oh I dunno about that that's temptation
D	got the camera
B	he's removing the shrink-wrap
A	there's four civilian cards
B	really?
D	is that er they can choose to riot or whatever right?
A	possibly right I'll shuffle these city cards then
B	the civilians are clones they all look the same
A	they all look the same to me
C	okay don't don't open any doors so these this is
B	don't open any doors?
C	these these are doors
B	oh
C	that's what they're calling them
B	no chance in this house
C	that's that might be the joke of the day
A	this is the best way to shuffle
B	in Vegas?
C	yeah
B	this is how they shuffle in Vegas
A	no they genuinely don't
B	they er don't even shuffle in Vegas they just get a new decks
A	no they honestly the croupiers they shuffle like this
B	ah but but not with
A	when
B	not face up
A	when the
B	or face up
[ANNOTATION]	The croupiers in Vegas shuffle the cards face up.	Contradiction
A	er yeah I don't I don't know but they will get new decks and they'll play it that much
C	wow guys
C	look at these
A	an advent calendar that's a month
B	it is like an advent calendar
A	is that a month then?
C	yeah I
C	and it says note a
D	it's
C	making the
D	is it like one of these for each game the Sherlock Holmes one? you know one of those you play for each game?
B	mm
A	for the month I think I yeah I'm not sure er I don't know actually
A	so read the overview
C	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	An advent calendar does not cover an entire month.	Contradiction
A	how do you play a Legacy game? unlike most games which fully reset every time you play Pandemic Legacy carries some elements
B	no
A	are permanent
B	I don't like that
A	also at the end of each game the group will make two game end upgrades to prepare your future games
C	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Pandemic Legacy fully resets every time you play it.	Contradiction
B	we know what a dossier is
D	well printed
A	the dossiers also contain hidden information that will
D	yeah
A	be revealed as you play some rules labelled A through Y are missing throughout this rulebook as you play you will gain these missing rules and stick them into the rulebook from that point on these rules will be permanently changed
[ANNOTATION]	You can break the rules of the game.	Neutral
D	we haven't the
A	so if you're that side of the board if you wanna be red er blue and yellow me and
B	yeah always
A	no turning back after that is there?
B	no
A	the American er plastic are you getting the Petri dishes?
B	yeah I was gonna say
A	gone to you've got to
B	it's not the same without the Petri is it? it's not science without a Petri dish
[ANNOTATION]	There might be a green player on the board.	Neutral
D	thank you I've stopped filming for a sec
B	you've stopped filming?
D	well when
A	keep it keep the flow of it
D	so don't say anything funny for the for the next five minutes
A	so he's pissed off though now?
A	okay save
[ANNOTATION]	One person might be upset.	Neutral
B	so now we're not recording
A	okay save the film
B	doesn't it have to be a a an hour of
A	no that's for
B	continual?
A	that
D	it doesn't anyway for
B	wait what are you
C	we're being double-recorded
B	are you recording on that or that?
D	I'm recording the sound on that and video on that or video and sound on
A	well there then we can splice it
B	will they synchronise?
D	yes no I did a lot of er of er filming when I was in the school it was er I really enjoyed it and and erm
B	that's a tiny tripod that
D	it is nice isn't it?
C	well mm
D	and erm it's a good camera one and er I got a video editing software suite and I really enjoy it
B	what do you use?
A	just check
D	MyCheck
B	MyCheck is that is that a free to download one?
D	no no it's it's
B	no
D	quite an expensive one
B	yeah
D	I bought it with the er with with the school
B	nice
D	it's erm you know it's got green screen options and
B	oh really?
D	and titles and
C	er er I'm counting the the same numbers there's twenty-two
A	twenty-four in four colours it says here
C	alright well I've got twenty-two
A	so just chuck the old ones in the top of the Petri dish and put the new ones in
B	are you mixing cubes?
C	mm I was just seeing if we could use the old ones but there's two more of erm
B	and the er the new ones look like they've got more curvature
C	could make a could be a key difference
B	they're rounded aren't they?
D	no you'd think they'd have Petri dishes in er
C	yeah mm
A	and we've got
C	are they all blues?
A	yeah the the older one's in here
B	so they upped the disease cubes by two?
A	yeah
A	you've got the vials as well
B	okay right oh
D	can we nail this flap onto the table?
A	so what stays and what gets
A	reset? writing on the board putting stickers on the board or on cards and possibly tearing up or destroying components are permanent changes in all other ways the game resets at for the start of each game the pieces on the board cards in hand outbreaks et cetera all start fresh game months Pandemic Legacy is broken into twelve months starting with January
D	even if you lost?
A	yeah
B	so you get two attempts?
A	you get two shots at it this is the Legacy deck the Legacy deck contains cards that will describe what happens over the course of the game's twelve months it's arranged in a specific order do not look through or shuffle these cards at the start of the game draw the cards and read them one at a time until you get to a card that says stop on the back
B	start at the top right?
A	that so yeah you start there so it says stop
D	no you
B	no you start at the er
D	start at the other side
B	the other side right?
A	no it says this is the end of the Legacy deck
C	yeah yeah
A	please start from the other side of the deck
B	and then it says stop
A	stop yeah
D	well
B	then you turn over and you start on the other side
A	don't know it's
B	okay
A	if the Legacy's deck becomes scattered have someone who is not playing the game put the cards back in their orders using their number on the corner blah blah blah blah blah
A	so don't touch it basically
B	mum
A	so that's Legacy deck zero one B
C	the
A	does that make sense? more or less?
C	yeah
B	yeah yeah
D	but how does the first card say stop
A	well
D	though?
B	that's that's that's just like the dummy card isn't it?
C	yeah
D	ah okay okay
C	so you can't look at the first
B	yeah
D	okay
C	and find out what it is
A	or draw this card and read the other side just before you set up your first game
C	yeah
A	so we'll do that probably
C	yeah
B	are we gonna set it up now?
C	so
A	so we do that now well
B	the dossiers er the five dossiers
B	matching the numbers or letters on the card one at a time resolving each one before opening the next some of these dossier doors will contain one-time stickers others will create a card that will be used from time to time in future games
C	oh
B	so you peel them off and you deal with them as as and when
A	as and when
B	er the packages there are eight packages in the game
A	check
B	check
C	yeah
B	okay
A	that's so you open this packet eight if you lose four games in a row?
B	yeah
C	mm gonna happen
B	erm objectives at the beginning of each game you will have an objective you need to complete in order to win the number of objectives needed to win in a month is shown on the board for that month
A	that might hopefully that'll be
B	yeah
A	there yeah
B	okay so these are the objectives
C	wow January February yeah look oh so
B	ah
C	and the stars may be difficulties like
A	yeah I'd say so
B	number of
C	so those
B	the number of objectives maybe?
A	yeah
B	er if an objective is marked as mandatory it must be completed in order to win you do not need to decide which other objectives you are trying to accomplish at the beginning of any game you may wait to see how the game unfolds some objectives will remain in play until the game
A	sure
B	erm
B	yeah
A	so does that mean four cards
B	so
A	go into the player deck?
B	funded event cards so
A	yeah
B	these are the event cards
A	yeah
B	yeah so
A	so we get four added here
C	and we and we get to choose which is the good
B	we get to choose yeah
A	okay
B	so the minimum funding is zero and the maximum is ten
C	right yeah
B	but there there's only
A	have they have they got a value on them?
C	no so but there's only eight at the moment
B	yeah so there'll be two more
A	oh yeah okay
B	introduced er the game calendar
C	here
B	no that
C	oh
B	that's this er use the game calendar to record your progress
A	in the rule book that's that that's the back of er the rule book
B	er nice okay use the game calendar to record your progress wins losses players involved and your current funding level the game calendar can be found on the back of this book er reminder token this token is used occasionally during games to remind players to remember something
A	okay where's that?
A	I've
C	so what's that?
B	that's it's just if you
A	so
B	if you like place it
A	so
C	oh yeah
A	that go on it so you'll put that purple thing on it
C	oh right
A	that's the reminder
B	game board regions six regions objectives
A	six regions?
B	yeah
B	yeah so game is broken into six regions
D	that's new isn't it?
B	er each
C	yeah
B	roughly equivalent to a continent these will come into play later
A	okey-doke
B	so okay
C	you got any
D	got any er some gaffer tape that can go across the back of it?
C	no er like er
B	Blu-Tack
C	Blu-Tack yeah
B	just a staple gun will do
D	I er and then
C	a hammer and nails?
B	erm
C	yeah
B	when you move the cubes yeah disease tracking area here
A	yeah
B	er use these area use this area of the board to apply changes to any of the four diseases and a panic level er cities are panicking as these disease take hold
A	okay
B	the first time a city panics place the level one sticker
A	yeah
B	in the panic level box
C	right
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	near the city
C	yeah
B	after that place the next numbered sticker over the previous one
A	yeah
B	one two three et cetera
C	yeah
B	the effects of panic levels are shown below these effects are cumulative so level one state unstable no effect
A	yeah
B	level two state rioting effect players cannot take direct flights or charter flights in or out
C	oh
A	right
B	research stations are destroyed and
C	what?
B	cannot be rebuilt that's well that
A	oh that's only for two though
B	that's two
C	oh my
B	that's for serious rioting
A	yeah
B	that's
A	yeah that's
B	oh
A	don't you
B	yeah er level four so okay so that's level two and three so you get two levels
C	yeah
B	with of rioting so level four is collapsing
C	so what that says what? discard one card the city's colour to drive into it at all
B	discard one card
A	to move into it
B	of of
C	yeah
B	you need to discard a
C	wow
B	so you've gotta get rid of a card to get there
A	to either drive to to to drive into it to walk into it
B	to get there yeah
A	okay
B	or yeah anything er
C	so you probably just go around it or
B	that will be it would slow you down yeah
A	well you that's er if it's got three because it will have three cos it's an outbreak
C	yeah
A	that's amazing
B	so each time a city's a
D	don't worry about it
B	its panic level will go up by one so yeah basically as soon as there's an outbreak you go up one
A	yeah
B	so in one game it's quite
A	so you really don't want outbreaks more so than usual
B	that like Baghdad if you
A	yeah
C	yeah so what we were saying dad er the cities have panic levels now yeah good idea so these have panic levels now that erm if people start rioting so if there's an outbreak er more than more than
A	three
C	once
A	more than three cubes on a city
C	yeah so if there's an outbreak of more than
D	and those are the civs that you er
C	don't know what
C	no don't
B	yeah I don't know what the civs do yet but
C	so that means you know once they if there's more than two outbreaks that means you know there are three cubes on there more than er two times you can't get in or out no direct flights and you can't try to charter one in or out and you can't all the research stations there are destroyed and you can't
D	very realistic actually that's
C	yeah it's good
D	you know in
A	yeah
D	a logical
B	so that the we denote that sorry
C	that's the word yeah
B	yeah? yeah the number of
C	the stickers okay
B	stickers in the box next to
D	oh okay
B	the thing
[ANNOTATION]	Stickers are next to the envelops.	Neutral
D	I bet you the civs are involved in some kind of way
B	they're
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	they will do
B	er so yeah if it gets to level five the state is fallen discard an additional card of the city's colour to enter erm for a total of two cards if your character is in a city when it falls it is lost
C	the character's lost?
B	see lost characters on page five
D	oh so they kill them then?
C	oh
[ANNOTATION]	The lost characters can be up to 5.	Neutral
D	what forever?
C	possibly
A	yeah
B	er each player has a specific character with special abilities to improve er each team's to improve the team's chances each player begins the game by er each player begins the game one by creating a character to create a character select a character card and give your character a name
C	oh cool
B	er these characters will carry through the game through from game to game and they may become lost see below you do not have to play the same character in every game
C	yeah
B	okay?
C	cool
B	scars
A	oh
C	dad what you doing there?
D	okay go on
[ANNOTATION]	Each player can help their group in their own unique way.	Entailment
B	characters can be mentally or physically damaged over the course of play when this happens choose an available scar and add it to your character's card characters are scarred when they are in a city that outbreaks and may be scarred in other ways that will be noted in future roles so if either if you're in a city and it has an outbreak
C	and it goes
B	you
A	PS PTSD
[ANNOTATION]	Characters are not always healthy.	Entailment
B	yeah you just go you lose it you go AWOL
A	eight point nine that's not a session is it?
C	oh no
B	wait what is it? five nine?
A	the pale ale
B	IPAs are normally over five percent anyway but erm good session's what like
A	yeah double it then
A	uhu
[ANNOTATION]	Pale Ale is a type of a refreshment.	Contradiction
B	so you must place a scar on a character that has no room for it the character becomes lost so you can only have erm
B	yeah
A	right come on now let's
B	so yeah you can only take two scars and then you then the character is lost
B	I think if you
C	take scars when
B	when you're in when it's
C	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	The scars are red.	Neutral
B	an outbreak
C	yeah
B	er so if you have to put
A	but I don't think that's gonna happen in now is it?
B	a scar on on a character and there's no more scar slots or if your character was in a city when it falls your character is lost when you character is lost destroy your character card
A	oh that's great that
C	cannot
A	but oh you've got to set fire to it
B	yeah
A	what if you lose this five characters if you lose two then you can't play with
[ANNOTATION]	The character cannot be destroyed.	Contradiction
D	you can't play the game
A	four player
B	no what happens then is you take a civilian card matching your pawn
C	ah
B	and place your pawn in a city with a research station this may be your current city if there are no research stations to play place your pawn in Atlanta if your character was lost during your turn continue with your turn keeping any remaining
A	but the
C	yeah
B	civilians have no special abilities upgrades or relationships
A	oh
D	okay
B	eat it or eat the card
D	no you have you have to set fire to it and you can't you can't just rip it
[ANNOTATION]	Civilians are important during the gameplay.	Contradiction
C	rip it and burn it
B	right
C	okay
[ANNOTATION]	The card must be set on fire.	Entailment
A	right then character reference now
B	okay
B	so you can move any pawn if its owner agrees to any city containing another pawn or move another player's pawn
A	random
B	if its owner agrees as if it were your own
A	at random
B	and we can pick we'd pick
C	gotta be random
A	you've got to be random
D	well you can be
A	okay
B	can't do anything else
[ANNOTATION]	Pawns need to be moved to cities in the game.	Entailment
A	I can only be the most important vital
D	oh no is it?
C	no no
B	no no take the medic
D	it's just the only one I know what to do with
[ANNOTATION]	One of the pawns is not a doctor.	Contradiction
B	yeah that's fine okay so er
A	well do you wanna choose?
B	er please be the
A	no god now you've got attached to it now
B	no I'm not
C	okay I'm a
B	alright
C	scientist I'm
B	I'm I'm a researcher
A	and I'm
A	and I'm
C	it's
B	tell you what the dispatcher's the most is look it's listed first cos it's best?
A	I don't look at his face oh hello
A	alright then
B	so
A	oh yeah generalist is pretty good right
B	well a generalist like has has slots for four different
C	you're right
B	character upgrades and he gets five actions per turn everybody else has only got two upgrades
A	oh
B	the generalist can take five upgrades
A	okay so dispatcher then
B	four upgrades
A	I may as an action either move any oh so
B	uhu
A	as an action move any pawn to a city with another pawn
C	yeah
A	that's important so that
B	that's correct yeah
A	if you're in Jakarta and
C	yeah that card's mad
A	yeah
B	that's see it's
A	okay
B	the most powerful player in the game
C	yeah
A	he's the er he's pulling all the strings in the background
C	mm
A	he's Phil Neville to your Gary Neville
A	get
B	he
A	I just did that to
B	but but the you did that and not the card?
A	not the card they're taking it seriously
B	good so er
A	okay
B	cards that need to be played or discarded come from the dispatcher's hand er a card discarded after for a charter flight must match the city the pawn is moving from
A	don't understand
B	okay so if you were to use me
A	yeah
B	if you were to fly
A	yeah
B	Essen erm and there's nobody in Essen
A	yeah
B	if I have erm
A	yeah
B	you can fly me from Johannesburg but
A	right but it's just if you had Johannesburg I can't I've got to have those cards to move you?
B	that's what it says cards
A	yeah
B	that
A	come from my hand
A	come from the dispatcher's
A	yeah okay
B	yeah
A	cool
B	alright right medic removes all cubes not one er if the disease has been cured automatically removes all cubes of that colour
C	yeah
B	by simply by entering it not as an action medic also prevents placing diseased cubes of cured diseases in his location medic's automatic removal of cubes also happens during other players' turns so if he's moved by the dispatcher
C	yeah yeah
B	er the researcher er when doing the share
C	yeah yeah a scientist
B	scientist er needs only four not five city cards we don't have the generalist then do we?
C	no
B	okay so we've got
C	yeah but not the researcher though
B	I've got the researcher
C	oh have you?
B	it's it's that one isn't it?
C	okay
B	erm without this card having to match her city this the transfer must be from her hand to the other player's hand but it can occur on either player's turn
C	okay
D	why does it say their date of birth?
B	er they when er you get a birthday parties in the er
C	in the game?
B	in top secret top secret birthday party
C	yeah
B	surprise researcher it's your birthday we're going to Bogara
C	oh pens then time to write our names
B	oh my
C	where do you do that? oh do we have to write things
B	er it well it says each create er
A	service record
B	create a character select a character card and give
C	yeah
D	but er oh okay
B	I guess a name as in who's playing right?
A	that's here yeah
C	well I'm calling mine Scully I dunno what you're doing
B	well she's a scientist
C	yeah
A	sexy scientists
B	your
A	do you think he's Asian? what were you trying to say?
B	I think he's a girl
A	it's not a girl it's a guy
C	er it's

B	that's good I like that
D	you do all that now do you?
A	I don't know where we write do we write it at the top?
B	I think er on the service record you write so we'll write January the player's name
A	no no no that will be but that will be you rather than
B	oh okay
A	yeah
B	er so character name
A	but you don't have to do that till the end anyway
B	no yeah where it says
A	so it's just yeah invent the name now

D	I don't know if I'm
C	yeah
B	right so er I'll move on to set up or if
C	one read the mission
B	have you made a mistake?
A	I've made a mistake
C	oh
B	you're getting the
B	the Tipp-Ex out
C	shall we we need to record
A	it's it's recording
C	it's oh is it?
B	did you spell Yamaha right?
D	and take that erm off the table
C	I guess so yeah but we we do need to get in that box
B	don't be getting Tipp-Ex on Yamaha's face
A	yeah or the table
C	thematically
C	you should live with your mistake
D	did you know that the er
A	live with the
D	guitarist from The Monkees' mother invented Tipp-Ex? Mike Mike Nesmith
B	that's his her
B	so was his mother called Mrs
D	and she's
B	Tipp-Ex
A	Tipp-Ex
C	okay shall I draw it? yeah do you wanna draw it?
B	wait what wait what's happening?
C	so
A	uhu
C	read the mission briefing and integrate new cards if any into the game
A	okay
B	right so we that one you turn and
C	yeah
B	January
A	January
A	mission briefing oh
B	er er we're gonna be the one of these
A	you know the drill
B	we've got four viruses causing us problems they seem to be mutating faster than usual we have someone looking into that
D	four
A	now
D	look I'm sorry I haven't a clue
C	keep it under control
B	er as one of them
D	mm
C	mm may grow beyond our
B	full stop
C	okay and it says keep drawing so do you wanna read it again so we actually?
B	you know the drill we've got four viruses causing us problems they seem to be mutating faster than usual we have someone looking into that but now keep it under control as one of them may be as one of them may grow beyond our capabilities
C	okay
A	it says keep drawing so I turn it over
B	but can we just look at that and then discard?
A	yeah yeah it goes in the erm objective
C	discover cures to the four diseases
C	okay regular game of Pandemic
B	solid
A	regular
B	solid regular
C	so that and then we don't have this
B	I think well it's all gone so should I
C	so yeah but that's gotta be face up yeah
B	are we going with five
C	so put all structures initially they have research er nearby er
A	yeah
C	in further in future games there might be others
A	yeah
B	permanent research centres?
A	yeah
B	nice
C	place the outbreak alert er for cure marker vial side up erm er blah blah as a group let's decide which funded event cards are gonna be in the player deck
A	erm
B	we get four?
C	we get two
B	is it two?
C	a four-player game yeah
B	only two?
C	yeah that's the
B	what okay I so we've got
C	so we've got
D	so we can choose?
C	yeah the it's this is the funding compartment of the of the game
A	okay
B	mm
C	so do you wanna say the new ones
B	the new ones looks like a flexible aid package which you can discard one to three city cards from your hand account player takes one additional action for every card you discard so if you need to
A	doesn't sound that strong I suppose if you cure if you cure a disease so you don't need the blues then you could get rid of them
B	you could just get and you get three extra er
D	that's not bad
B	so you you'd basically get
A	yeah
B	up to three extra actions by discarding cards
D	is that for that round or is that?
B	er just for that
A	one turn
B	so you'd play it and then you discard three cards or up to three and then you get three actions back erm
A	that's getting two reactions for not discarding anything
C	uhu
A	so I would say there's not
C	yeah
A	the value in choosing that one you can choose that
B	uhu er remote remote treatment that's the same so you can remove any two disease cubes from the board and airlift you can get you can move
D	oh yeah
C	yeah
B	move anywhere but I think one quiet night is really helpful
C	yeah and I so I also think er the research station we haven't got
A	cos you haven't got
D	what does that do?
C	put a research
D	get an extra one?
C	that's what you got yesterday to put a research station wherever you want it's not an action
B	and that's really handy so you can travel between
C	and you can
B	yeah
C	put it in Istanbul Baghdad or Paris or
B	I yeah I think
C	I would say that
B	I'd cos to start off we don't there's only one on the board
C	yeah yeah
B	so definitely a
C	so we could choose two of them yeah?
B	that would
C	that's the Hail Mary it's
B	it
C	but that's
A	airlift is pretty
C	but it
A	I think
C	but you've we've got a dispatcher who's got that skill set
A	yes yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
C	I think we er use
A	yeah
C	use erm the
A	yeah
C	one quiet night when we get three
A	alright
C	okay?
A	so these two?
B	the only other one
A	and they're going in the player
B	that you might want to contemplate
A	Brazilian population
C	mm er er
B	Brazilian population you remove one er any city card from the infection this card pile so it it doesn't ever get infected in that
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	I mean they're all useful forecast is quite useful
C	but that's that's pretty good yeah
B	I I think one quiet night saves you
C	okay yeah
B	so
A	so do these go on the player deck?
C	yeah they do yeah
B	oh
C	er now
A	player deck
C	player deck into five face down piles
B	uhu
C	and we're putting five epidemic cards in there
B	so divide
C	yeah
B	just put them in
C	just er taking that out so dad we're playing it at a difficulty level above what we played yesterday we only had four epidemic cards
D	we only had four last time didn't we?
B	but these are easy-peasy there's no mutations er we've got a researcher
C	yeah yeah but but
B	we've got a scientist we've got a dispatcher we've got the mm er what is the medic called what's his name?
D	Professor Fate
B	Professor Fate is gonna help us out
C	or
B	yeah
A	Scully is I guess
B	Scully's here
A	Dana
B	I'm just checking it might have been her sister
C	erm and the marker blah blah blah yeah
B	Dina
C	so yeah let's let's set up the board then
B	I've got I've got er some probably some epidemics here
C	okay
B	I'm itching to get rid of them
D	what are the
B	they they
C	no they come in later
B	you become you become a civilian
A	well hopefully we won't ever
D	oh
B	when you if you go down
D	I see
B	you become a civilian
D	I see I see
B	no special powers just a fancy power suit
D	mm okay
C	okay so I'm gonna start infecting the first three on the board ah
B	gets three
C	gets three
B	okay so that'll have a panic level now did we put panic level?
A	no
C	no it's only when it breaches
B	it's only when it breaches yeah I don't wanna be getting these things wrong straightaway
A	oh
C	well that's spread out
B	Hong Kong is er well-connected there
A	so yeah Hong Kong Khartoum and
B	Mumbai
A	Mumbai
A	Mumbai
B	shall I do you wanna make five piles?
A	hang on hold your horses
C	Washington
A	hold your horses
C	Milan Istanbul
B	yeah I done it
B	and Milan yeah Washington Istanbul and erm they're done the last three
C	Essen
B	Karachi
C	Delhi
B	Delhi okay we've got a we've got a problem
A	it's all going on in the Middle East
B	in the Middle East
A	alright so we need to put this into five really right?
B	uhu uhu
A	more or less equal
B	yeah
A	one two
B	yeah even-stevens and I'm just gonna place these
A	and then we
B	rule master
C	oh so just just a a general er rule once you win a game once you win a month you get a bonus for the next month so that's the sort of incentive why you know you carry on you'll get to February whether you win or lose but you won't get
B	get the bonus
C	get that bonus
B	so there's like a cash bonus so we can
C	yeah
B	we can
C	yeah
B	spend on funding and then
C	yes
B	pharma
C	okay and now I think it's it's it's all the same there now for the moment
A	so
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	now are we meant to give players the city cards before the epidemic card goes in? in a normal game you are
C	yeah yeah
B	oh we're supposed to deal cards aren't we? yeah
A	so how many
B	er two is it? each
[ANNOTATION]	Person B thin they are gonna deal with cards	Entailment
C	but they need to be shuffled anyway
B	okay I do it
C	so yeah is it two cards each?
B	that's er
C	oh sorry sorry sorry sorry yeah we get two cards each but our funding level for the first game is four so we can choose two more
B	yeah I thought so
C	cards
B	so like
A	right shall we just do all that again?
[ANNOTATION]	Person A think it might get better if they gonna do that again	Neutral
B	yeah just take these out
C	get the epidemic cards
B	so we're getting panicked guys
[ANNOTATION]	Person B think is it so horrify	Entailment
C	two
B	we're getting panicked we've done this thousands of times
C	yeah
B	so we should go for a forecast and erm either resilient population or erm
A	I would say
C	how many
A	if that's
C	forecast
[ANNOTATION]	Person C think about anticipating is a good idea or not	Neutral
A	six
B	six
C	that is good
B	so
A	I think that's good when you're in more serious dire straits
B	forecast then?
C	well
A	I don't think four I I would say
B	two so
A	I dunno er no the
[ANNOTATION]	Person A is not sure about forecast	Neutral
B	yeah you need to
C	cos cos don't forget we're getting
A	what I'm saying like forecast I would save for later on rather than
C	oh yeah it's an end game thing but
A	no but for like a
B	well it you can
A	yeah yeah yeah I know I'm just saying
[ANNOTATION]	Person A think it could be an end game but it could be like another thing	Neutral
B	well we don't know our backs
A	but that because we've got a medic though
B	but our backs could be against the walls
A	I think with the medic the two extra actions means that it
B	uhu
C	yeah okay
A	yeah
B	extra six
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	uhu oh we should definitely borrow time then and what was the other one?
B	which means you remove the card from the
C	like this city is never gonna get infected
B	during the rest of that game so we could straightaway we could play take Mumbai out
D	you could take one out of the er
B	yeah
A	okay what's the
B	er remote treatment which is remove two disease cubes from the board resilient population flexible aid package where you discard up to three cards and take additional action for every card discarded an airlift where you can just move to any city
C	no we don't need the
D	no
B	or the or the forecast where you could rearrange you can view and rearrange the next six infections
D	oh that that sounds quite good doesn't it?
C	yeah
A	okay
B	forecast
A	okay
C	so
A	I it's two cards per person now are they?
B	yeah yeah
C	okay
A	yeah
C	er yeah it's face up or or do them again
B	uhu
C	apparently
B	okay
A	alright already got the
B	the forecast that's probably too early in the game to get a forecast isn't it?
A	to get it too early
B	you know just gonna be hanging onto that
A	yes that's
C	take a
A	card limit?
B	no er no it is included in your card limit
A	oh
B	it's yeah you can only hold seven including the
A	I did not know that
D	oh
C	no we weren't playing that were we?
D	we couldn't play that last night
C	okay
B	yeah
C	yeah it does it doesn't
B	just gonna shuffle them all
A	that's not how you do it
B	no?
A	no you've got to shuffle no?
B	yeah that's fair
A	because then it's staggered throughout the game is that how you're meant to do it though?
B	yeah but I mean sometimes that's just the way the cookie crumbles isn't it?
C	it doesn't actually say here
B	what your card limit?
C	mm
B	it should do
A	all of them are
unknown_female	hello
A	that's the house
C	why didn't you use the other door?
B	streaker
unknown_female	if only somebody would mend the door
A	I'll mend it for you mum
B	with a hammer
A	with a chisel
unknown_female	it's okay I can open the door
A	that's not how you should go about your life
A	that's mad that's mad
B	right so let's
A	go on then
B	play board games who's got the biggest population? I've got Lagos which is erm eleven and a half million
A	that's ten million too many people
D	I've got seventeen million for Beijing
B	oh well
D	can't see
C	erm
B	Beijing then
A	doesn't make it entirely clear
B	yeah er discard cards or play event cards and so you have seven so cos seven is er
C	okay
B	the event cards are included in the
A	okay then dad?
C	dad if it's on the tripod
C	yeah
A	leave it up
C	there's nothing to do with
A	keep ticking over you don't have to change the tape
D	no
A	yeah
D	I haven't got enough to film er the entire game
A	oh right
D	so I'm doing it in segments and
A	okay let's start then is it?
C	wow that was a long
B	that was long
A	come on then
D	okay which way
B	er
A	well how many more colours are we?
B	the biggest population goes first yeah
A	we don't know what colours we are
D	yeah no ask me that
B	you just change one
C	well no I'm
B	that's mad
C	the scientist with the white coat
D	well I'm or erm
A	you're brown this pass is pink and medic
D	which is brown though?
A	you're dad you're that one then no?
C	you're you're blue yeah
D	well I I thought I was
A	orange
C	orange yeah there's no orange in this
D	that's a blow isn't it?
C	it is yeah yeah
D	so I'm do the
C	just roll roll with those punches
B	what colour am I? the dark one?
A	you are brown now
B	okay yeah
A	and I'm pink
B	and you're pink that makes sense
A	yeah
C	go on then
B	right the first go is to Beijing with a population of
A	right let's really try and do this well then let's really try and go for this
unknown_female	does anybody want nuts or nibbles?
B	I don't know if there's time for that
A	no it's
unknown_female	mm some serious business it it?
A	some serious serious business going on I'm afraid
unknown_female	oh
B	well I'm I I wouldn't mind some nuts I'm I'm confident
D	how do you actually play
A	right go on then
A	go on then
C	so
B	er your go first then
D	how about if I just get Washington out of the way?
B	that sounds good
D	alright
A	is there no way you can fly to Mumbai or Hong Kong or Khartoum?
B	not yet
C	you can go you can
D	I could go to Beijing
C	you can go to Miami or go to Miami and fly
B	oh that could be a good idea
D	okay how
B	see because you've got the Miami card
D	oh sorry yeah
B	you can take a direct flight the
D	okay
B	Miami to anywhere
D	shall I do that and get in the zone?
B	I think Mumbai
A	yeah
B	would be more beneficial than Hong Kong
C	oh because you can sort out
A	you can go either way
C	yeah
A	depending on what comes out
C	but the the
A	I would say actually Mumbai to Khartoum anyway is one two three four it looks close but it actually isn't
C	but then you know you'd have to come
D	come back
C	yeah it's it's
A	no because but it's less to go from Hong Kong to Mumbai than it is from Mumbai to Khartoum
C	yeah
A	plus he's got the Beijing card so if he needs to fly all over
B	so from Miami
B	from Miami to
A	so count them out
D	one
B	uhu
D	and I can fly to
B	fly
A	you just fly anywhere you want now then
D	and so
B	and you can completely go against what we recommended
D	yeah
B	go to Riyadh if you want
D	straight to Hong Kong
B	yeah
A	two
D	that's two
B	yeah
D	and three to clear everything
B	no only if it
A	yeah
D	I'm medic yeah?
B	doesn't it doesn't yeah okay yeah that's brilliant three
D	okay and I've got one more turn
A	yeah
B	or you could go towards Beijing so you can fly out there next time
D	oh okay okay that's better okay so one yeah okay
A	but if you go towards if you go to Calcutta then you're only two away from Mumbai where you
D	oh
A	you need to go and you're getting further away from Mumbai if you're going there
D	I know but I like
[ANNOTATION]	Mumbai and Beijing are cities in the same country	Contradiction
A	yeah but you're flying from Beijing to Mumbai
B	thanks
A	you're losing a card whereas
B	thanks
A	it would only be and one action whereas it would only be two actions to go to Mumbai on land
B	and I guess
A	I think you're only saving the card's saving you're only saving one and losing a card
D	oh okay
B	keep the card
[ANNOTATION]	D is travelling from Beijing to Mumbai	Entailment
D	go on then
B	so do you want we'll
D	yeah
B	push it towards Calcutta
D	yes
B	alright solid so now er you draw two more city cards
D	Milan
C	oh
A	okay
D	so increase the infection rate marker
B	oh that's fine
C	yeah
A	who won the war anyway?
D	and er discard that card and intensify shuffle the cards on the infection
[ANNOTATION]	D is taking the train to go to Mumbai	Contradiction
B	okay so now we're in trouble we could we could be going
C	so
B	we've got
C	Hong Kong can come out
[ANNOTATION]	D has at least 1 city card	Entailment
B	well Mumbai and Khartoum are the issue
C	yeah
B	or Buenos Aires so
C	yeah
B	we've got three in
C	that's
B	how many cards have we got? twelve out?
C	yeah
D	yeah and this goes just back on the this card?
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	D has 20 cards	Contradiction
C	yeah so that's a really bad
A	well good job that I cleared one then anyway
C	yeah
A	okay so we're gonna see two now ready? the first one
A	Karachi
[ANNOTATION]	there is no problem with Mumbai and Khartoum	Contradiction
B	that's level up to level two
C	no that's good it's en route dad for you
D	yeah
A	Buenos Aires
B	Buenos Aires outbreak whoop whoop
D	fuck
A	that wasn't there before was it? the link straight down there
C	I don't think it was no you're right
B	so
C	and that's actually quite connected
D	no that's
B	right so
D	the didn't even see that
B	Buenos Aires is panicking
A	so do we need to put a sticker on it?
C	no no no no
A	just one?
C	that's one
A	but we need to put a
B	yeah one yeah one goes on it
A	we need to put a panic on it
B	they're panicking
A	and stable
B	yeah
C	erm
B	first it's the first one on the board
A	that did not take long did it?
B	shall we remove Buenos Aires from the?
C	yeah well we we can't yet can we?
D	we do you what are you doing now then?
C	because it's had er one outbreak in it
B	they're panicking in Buenos Aires
D	and is that's permanent?
B	yeah
C	yeah
D	so what
B	it can only increase
C	it can only get worse
D	I mean for for the next game as well then?
B	yeah
D	but forever now?
A	forever yeah
C	for ever and ever
B	is that just a bad joke? or
A	no
A	if you won't sleep tonight because of that
B	it's not quite in the box but don't worry we we'll
C	but I turned it upside down
B	well we
A	he thinks outside the box
B	when we get to a two
B	we we'll someone else will do it
C	scrub that
A	I mean how much does it cost to buy the new a new
C	warm
B	yeah can we start
B	can we send it back?
A	and we we've only got warm soapy water
B	can we send it back? have you got the receipt?
C	yeah
B	okay we can send it back and start again
C	okey-doke right then
D	so outside the box
B	er so what just to confirm
C	no no no we've gotta do that
B	what
A	no
D	you can change that
C	oh it's the
D	change that before it sets like you can
B	can you pass thing? I just wanna confirm what panic oh actually you've got it there what
C	yeah okay
B	so unstable
C	so unstable no effect
A	next one the if if Buenos Aires goes again no direct flights in or out
B	that's forever that's
B	that's gonna ruin it
A	existing research stations destroyed no new research stations
C	that's nuts that's really tough
B	that's nuts
A	yeah
D	seriously when we you
D	we're five minutes into the game we're on January
D	that's what I that's what I mean
B	and we've had an outbreak in the first
C	so yeah that's it's
A	it's no longer a perfect game it's no longer a perfect board
D	once we're once we're in November and we've been played twelve time eleven times there's gonna be loads of stickers
C	yeah yeah
D	and er
D	that's er
B	yeah it's not easy that
C	one two three I can get there and cure take one
A	it's not coming out it's not coming out again is it?
B	yeah if it's out we just ignore them
A	unless you get an epidemic but I don't think you are
C	yeah but you know what I mean
A	the other thing you can end up in somehow in Chennai and I can give you Chennai but I'm not
C	yeah and I don't wanna go there
B	okay okay just so
A	cos you only need four anyway
C	yeah
A	so you should be the black guy rather than the
C	so I'm gonna do that the the
B	you can anybody I just need to check anybody can take a card or I can give a card to you
D	you can share yeah
B	whilst we're in the same city
C	can I take mm from
A	you've got nothing to take dad should have taken one from you
C	yeah
D	why? tell me why
C	yeah
B	er a player who shares knowledge with you on their turn can take any one of your city cards
D	okay and
C	so
D	to share knowledge you can either give the card that matches the city you're in to another player or take that card
A	yeah
B	unless
A	but because
B	unless I'm the
A	special skill is
D	ah
B	we don't need to be in the same city
D	oh okay
C	so that was a mistake and there's nothing I can get from
B	I can no
C	or me neither
B	I think I think we can share knowledge
C	but yeah but I'm saying I've got
B	on the
C	I've got red and black and you've got blue and yellow
A	yeah and I've got a black so
C	so I'm just
A	we should have given dad a blue then
C	yeah
A	right yeah
C	one two three
B	okay now erm don't draw an epidemic
C	okay current player takes two extra actions on the turn that's good Baghdad okay I'll looking likely to be
B	go to Baghdad and build a research centre
A	cos cos
C	I only need two
A	two more blacks
C	yeah
B	they're the the funding events that we haven't used
C	Essen
C	and Istanbul
B	Istanbul
C	can you turn the cards over as well? Istanbul's on three
A	yeah it's not coming whereas Mumbai and Khartoum are coming out so
B	Mumbai and Khartoum will come out next go so
A	I can okay so it's my turn
C	you might have to burn Chennai to get
A	to stop Mumbai coming out
C	yeah
A	cos that's the thing now you've gotta think about
B	you're not gonna be collecting blacks
A	no but I'm saying if I if I fly to Chennai I can
C	what do we think? what do we reckon?
D	how do you know which is gonna come out?
B	because they were infected and when you've got the epidemic card they go back to the top of pile so we know which ones
C	so know that
B	have already come out so
D	yeah yeah
B	they will be coming out again
C	you just
D	or get me to do it
A	I could move I could move for my extra action
C	have you got an extra action?
A	I could move dad to me yeah
D	yeah
A	I can move dad to me
C	have you got an extra action then?
B	mm
A	no I
C	yeah
A	Mumbai er so I've got an
C	but he'd only take two off eventually you know next go
A	no I'm saying I can move
B	I think what we need to do is
A	so first Chennai right?
B	so get rid of Mumbai
A	so first tonight right so I'm gonna fly one to Chennai
B	burn it
A	two to move to Mumbai three to take off a black I can take another one off I can move dad to me probably not worth it
D	why? cos I can take two off
C	I think if you
A	yeah but then okay and then you're one closer to Khartoum
B	I think
A	or I can move you to dad's so you can give him the blue probably not worth it
B	I think that I think we need to make sure that Khartoum well Khartoum might go off but
D	yeah
C	yeah but
A	dad's in
D	mm
A	is er it's moving him slightly closer to Khartoum but he's still not gonna get to he's gonna take one off
C	if
A	no that's me this is dad's
C	yeah but you can move him to any
A	yeah yeah yeah
C	and
A	who
C	see I'm thinking what are you gonna do on your next go?
B	erm
C	well not that
B	but I don't think
A	but he hasn't got anything for he hasn't got anything to give him
B	yeah I don't think my skill is as
C	you
C	yeah yeah a bit of a but you're not all er what else are you gonna do here? are you going to go to Washington treat that and then stay up in Europe?
B	yeah and
C	whereas you could give dad the
A	but but but like we know know er because if
C	yeah
B	I could build a research centre but I don't
A	but anyway er
C	maybe
A	that until
C	yeah yeah
A	it's a waste of time
B	I think we need to get the medic closer to the problem
C	okay
A	move dad to me
B	yeah and that's it
C	okay you think so
B	and use your special skills
C	do you think so?
B	mm
A	he's closer but he's further way than
D	no I'm not
A	well
D	I'm not that far
A	Khartoum no but one two three four one whereas now you're at one two the same
C	okay
B	Khartoum's
A	yeah
B	the problem
A	yeah
C	okay two pick up
A	Khartoum
B	handy
A	Algiers alright and infect two Mumbai
B	no because the medic's there
C	no that's the quarantine specialist
A	no that's er er Jackie Brown but anyway it's good
B	are you sure?
A	yeah I'm sure
B	I thought that was only I read something in that
C	no
B	I'll check erm
A	Khartoum
B	Khartoum well it was gonna happen wasn't it?
A	oh
B	the medic
C	go on then square
B	oh okay of cured diseases yeah if the disease was cured it would
A	right Khartoum has exploded we are in problem as
D	so
A	one
A	two
D	tell me what's happening there
A	three
A	oh so
B	we had an outbreak
C	in Khartoum
D	and that's got or everything Khartoum's connected
B	so everything connected take a hit of the yellow fever
A	and Khartoum is now unstable
C	oh yeah what are the what are we calling the diseases? so yellow fever?
A	but don't we decide that when don't you name them officially at certain points I think?
C	in the game?
A	I reckon the first time you cure it or whatever you get to name them
B	oh nice I think if you cure it
C	mm okay
B	yeah
D	that's a bit racist isn't it? yellow fever it's just
A	well it would happen in China
B	oh come on don't be turning it that one's upside down
C	that's fine
B	yeah coming up well done right turn
A	oh we're doing quite badly everybody
C	yes that's
D	and we
A	quite bad isn't it?
B	this is
C	yeah
B	two three goes two outbreaks
B	not a good ratio
A	and only one epidemic
B	yeah so there's more to come
C	okay
A	and there's five in there
C	yeah
B	don't worry we get a second chance in January
C	oh
A	we don't we don't want that in the first month though right
B	I'm gonna
A	it's not coming out again though is it?
B	no
A	Johannesburg has been infected twice by
B	by those one's weren't it? okay wow this is a shitstorm
A	Khartoum's not a bad
B	I think that's makes more I mean who's got
A	we need a research station actually don't we?
B	yeah
A	actually no and I was thinking along that
B	I could build one in London but whether that's whether that's
C	probably
A	no it's not worth it
B	it's not really worth it is it?
A	and er that's all your actions then
B	yeah I think maybe go to Khartoum then
C	yeah
B	because you guys are busy and if
A	yeah
B	then that
A	Johannesburg could be the three that comes off from an epidemic as well
B	yeah I think get to Khartoum so I'll fly to Lagos
B	discard Lagos
A	one
B	two
A	er forever
B	er I've got a New York
C	yeah
B	and I've got a Bangkok
C	okay
B	and I'm gonna expect Delhi
A	and we've got nobody round and we've got nobody there
B	well we've got a research centre nearby
C	yeah but we can't
B	get to it
A	okay dad
B	a medic
C	a medic
B	we need a medic
D	okay so I'll clear where I am
B	that makes a lot of sense
D	yeah so that's one move
A	very good
D	now shall I clear Khartoum and erm Delhi?
B	yeah
B	well you won't be able to
A	or Karachi
B	you won't be able to clear those
A	to yeah Karachi
C	because it's well-connected right?
D	okay so so I've had one two
B	one yeah two that's one
A	and two
B	yeah
A	three
D	and Delhi?
A	you could move to Delhi but you can't cure it
B	you can only you you've only got one action left
A	or you could get closer to Istanbul
D	er I I'd say get closer to Istanbul and then
B	yeah sounds about right
D	okay
C	good move
A	okay
D	how many?
B	two
A	two
C	don't forget I've got an event card that gives us two extra if we're in
D	okay Joburg
C	so any player
A	yeah
B	that's good
A	that
D	no no
A	you could use that now
B	the current player
B	mm
C	oh yeah so then can play
B	no but anybody can play it
C	yeah yeah
B	yeah so yeah
A	you could use that now and dad could
B	is he gonna come out again?
C	yeah it's it's on there isn't it? Istanbul
B	erm
C	so we're saying I could use this
D	yeah
C	event card
B	gives you two extra moves
A	you may as well
B	yeah yeah
A	cos what are you gonna use it for? to get dad to cure something you can only cure
D	can you can you do it even though I've started
B	yeah
D	pulling?
B	you can play it at any time
A	yeah
C	okay
B	so go to Baghdad
A	no it's Istanbul
D	Istanbul
B	and via one yeah
A	one
D	two
B	two
A	no no you can't do it
A	you can't do it
B	yeah
A	you can't do it
D	why?
B	cos it's that
A	it's you can't it's two moves so you can't one two you can't go there and cure
B	that's not
C	so yeah but he cannot cure
D	well
C	Karachi and cure Istanbul
D	well I've done it now haven't I?
A	yeah no but you can
D	can you?
C	yeah
B	we can reconsider
A	cos I'm I'm in Karachi so if Karachi gets one
C	yeah
D	oh it didn't seem morally right to er
C	to go back
D	yeah
A	yeah because you're just you're not saying I'm definitely doing this you're playing it out really you're going right so I go to Miami and I take one off Miami and then I fly to
D	but but how far go back can you go five moves you know?
A	no as long as
B	well it's still in your hand
A	your
B	yeah
A	as long as like
D	oh okay okay
C	mm
B	right so
A	so so you've gone dad one two
C	no no
A	one two three four and
C	er no I've well there's no point is there? oh is there?
B	yeah and
A	yeah
C	oh you need to go in
B	one two
C	two
A	extra
C	yeah
B	three
A	extra
C	yeah
B	four
A	so with your extra
B	right
A	two moves that
D	yes okay
A	right so we've left Karachi on two and
D	okay now I've taken Joburg
B	now one more
D	so I've got one more
A	well it's er on a black I suppose
D	Milan?
[ANNOTATION]	Someone has picked Joburg.	Entailment
C	and that's on three yeah
D	and I've got Milan
C	okay
A	okay we're onto
C	no
A	no Hong Kong was three before
B	yeah Hong Kong was the first one
A	are you stopping it?
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker D took Inter.	Contradiction
D	yeah only cos I know I can't film everything
B	dunno
B	we've
B	we've done one one full round then
A	you've had five turns haven't you?
B	uhu
C	one two three four Washington
A	yeah you don't need to be I mean it's not coming out but yeah if you get a epidemic you never know
C	I can go one two Khartoum I can't
B	yeah
A	give you a red one two three you could take a red one
[ANNOTATION]	The speakers have finished one round.	Entailment
C	yeah shall we do that?
A	no no no no one two
C	yeah
A	three so you could take on off Buenos Aires or Joburg cos Joburg's gonna come out
C	yeah no I'd say er Buenos Aires cos it I don't want it to go to panic level two
A	two yeah
C	it really is
A	been quite bad we've been quite unlucky with it
[ANNOTATION]	Buenos Aires is in Argentina.	Neutral
B	yeah so
C	okay
B	or I can give it to you
C	okay er
A	so
C	no no
A	he's
C	I'm not in
[ANNOTATION]	Apart from the game, speaker A is usually a lucky person.	Neutral
A	he's he's he's not gonna go to he's he's gonna let Washington be on three cos he's gonna or is he?
C	so take one up here in
A	you can take any city card from
B	Rachel Riley's a researcher she gives cards
A	she okay yeah okay okay
C	and I only need
B	does fucking Countdown
C	I I only need
[ANNOTATION]	Rachel Riley can only condemn one to death.	Contradiction
C	er four
D	okay and you've
C	so
D	got a red
C	yeah yeah
A	okay so
C	so let's see Calcutta
A	that's brilliant
C	that's good
B	so one more black and we can get some shit cleared up
C	that's really good that's that's
A	that's excellent and we need so we do need to
B	we should be new cards
C	Beijing
A	yeah so we're onto new cities now dad
B	and new infections yeah
A	all the like Milan's not gonna be infected and Washington's none of the cities apart from Joburg might come out
D	yeah
B	Lima
D	I got Joburg
B	cool okay well
A	okay
C	yeah
B	well so we should be alright till the next epidemic
C	but yeah if you can anyone can feed me anything that'll be great as well
B	I can well you won't yeah just
A	no you're on your own at the moment
B	Algiers or Beijing
A	I can end in Algiers
D	I can give you Beijing
A	I can't end in Algiers I can end in Algiers I can fly to Khartoum
B	and then you move into
C	mm
A	no if I move to if I
C	no but can't you
B	you just move you can move yourself
A	yeah but I can't get to
B	watch this
A	I can't
B	I'm gonna go to Istanbul then Algiers
A	but how do I get to
D	you
C	cos you
B	cos you're the dispatcher you've got the
A	oh any pawn to any pawn?
B	yeah
C	so yeah
B	cos he's the best player in the game
A	okay
B	or you just move
A	I could build okay what I could do
C	well you can fly to Khartoum one
A	no that that
B	but he just moved yeah
A	that's one I just moved
A	without flying
B	just dispatch
A	I could build a research station two
C	yeah two
A	I could go three
B	three
A	four and you come and get Algiers from me
C	okay and you don't get an
B	that's yeah
A	or but do we need a
C	yeah I'd say
A	but do we want it in Algiers?
C	yeah
A	do we want it in Khartoum?
B	yeah it's
C	it's close enough
C	and you know
A	I suppose Buenos Aires and Khartoum's been panicked so
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	okay do you want shall I do that?
B	yeah
A	okay
B	burn Khartoum
A	one
B	and then move up to Algiers
C	three
A	so I'm
D	so you can give it to so
C	and now I can er
A	oh can you take it from me?
B	yeah cos you're in Algiers
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	okay and so that'll mean I can one two three I
A	no
B	or get close
C	but it's I can close secure it
A	well it's to this
C	so I don't have to
A	don't go back because I'll move you back
B	no don't go back as long as somebody's still there
A	I'll move you
C	okay
B	oh you're kidding me
B	infection marker up to two
A	so we don't want this to be Johannesburg or Lagos
C	well it's
B	or Washington
A	yeah but Johannesburg
C	yeah yeah
A	is only infected because of outbreaks we don't want it to be Sao Paulo
C	right okay
B	no yellows please
C	no yellows
A	Jakarta perfect
B	yeah that's good one to to be
A	and there's about fourteen cards to be shuffled here
B	okay so as long as Milan Washington don't come up we're okay
C	yeah
A	Jakarta
C	and don't forget we've got the
B	Jakarta can
C	we've got the forecast as well
A	it's another outbreak but yeah
B	there's nothing we can do with a forecast at
A	not
B	this juncture
A	no not at this point but
B	were you filming that?
A	ready?
B	oh okay
A	Milan
B	what?
C	so Essen goes on three
A	Algiers no no no
B	no
C	oh yeah sorry
A	Algiers
C	no no
B	no Milan went off
A	oh sorry
B	yeah
C	it's er yeah
A	Istanbul
B	just Istanbul yeah
B	well go on
A	right so we really don't want Essen
C	yes
A	want Essen
C	yeah
A	Washington would be bad Jakarta wouldn't be great either
B	oh you're kidding me
A	Jesus Christ
B	this is the worst
C	doesn't your doesn't your dad
D	oh
C	it's not panicked
B	no but they're on level one
C	yeah
B	this is er
C	wanna get that?
D	oh
C	go on
C	this one stand stand out
D	that's the
C	still the wrong way up
D	what do you mean? oh okay
A	this is the worst start to any Pandemic game I've honestly ever had
C	yeah
C	I dunno if those epidemics were even that space
A	they were weren't they
B	yeah we were we were thorough
A	it's not coming out again
B	okay
A	but Essen's
C	so you could fly to London
D	don't forget I'm next and I can go to erm Milan
B	mm
D	easily next time
B	yeah you but
D	and I can do Milan
A	yeah dad could do them both but it's a risk
C	he can't do both
A	he can
C	he can do one
A	one two three four
D	yeah
C	oh is that the one?
A	yeah
C	yeah sorry
A	yeah
D	so I can clear both of those
C	that's a decision to make
B	erm I've got two blues no one else has got any
D	I've got two blues
B	blues and Milan is
A	it's like a one in eleven it's a two in eleven chance of Essen coming out I would say more or less
C	I'm sorry if
A	what else could
C	oh I'm just
C	thinking what
A	what else could
B	I could take Milan or
A	but no if if you left that for dad Milan's not coming out Essen might come out and trigger Milan
C	yeah
A	if you left that what else are you gonna do?
C	he can go via dad and pick up a blue
D	uhu
B	I could pick up a blue one two take a blue
D	yeah
C	three four
B	I can take
B	I think erm any one I don't think I I think you can only you I can only take it once I can only take one card
C	okay are you sure?
B	yeah you can give any one
A	yeah I think I I think that
B	otherwise yeah I think that would be
A	no I think I heard that
B	too powerful
D	how long's the recording half an hour?
C	as long as this
B	this it's by well this er
C	maximum time as possible
B	it's just until we've run out of things to say
A	I mean I think we ran out of things to say
B	I think that I'm just
A	yeah when researcher when doing the share knowledge action the researcher may give any city card from a hand to another player in the same city as her without this card having to match the city doesn't say anything about doing it once per action
B	oh it says you may give any one of your city cards when you share knowledge so if I share knowledge more than once if I just yeah have four share knowledge actions
A	I think I think
B	it's just an action isn't it?
A	you can do it
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah okay
A	it doesn't say that you can't
B	it doesn't say you can only do it once per turn right? yeah I think you might be right so if I get
C	so four blues
B	so if I go one two and then I take Milan and
A	so so but then then if Essen comes out we we are in trouble
D	Milan and San Francisco
B	yeah
A	the only thing though we're close to losing the game anyway so we we may as well lose it spectacularly
C	and try to save
A	but then that's the other thing you lose it spectacular you are are then you're making that board a lot more difficult
C	yeah
B	I don't think Essen's coming up
A	oh right well that
A	based on that solid reason then
B	okay tell you what we could do is use the forecast card
A	I think now is the best time to use it I think
D	what tell me the forecast card then
A	well I play it at any time
B	you look at the top six
A	go look at and rearrange the top six of the infection deck put them back on top we could have
D	so we could
A	done that before
D	that's a good card
B	well
A	are we using it?
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	okay so
B	so you just turn the top one
A	so Beijing
B	could have could have milked it
A	Jakarta so Jakarta's gonna explode
B	that's okay
D	oh that's not bad
A	Karachi we would have been
B	told you that's gonna be come out
A	alright
B	just the researcher
C	no but the Jakarta we need to know about Jakarta
D	yeah because we
A	anyway we can rearrange them now
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	and then and then it's dad's turn next so dad's gotta get to Jakarta
C	well no dad's got to
D	well no I've got three of them first
C	mm well you well
A	doesn't but yeah you should well well
D	I mean that was a good thing
A	well
C	where am I? and er well I was gonna go to
A	yeah you're gonna er to Algiers with me if you went one two three you could fly to
C	Bangkok
A	you could fly to Sydney
C	oh yeah
A	you have to do that and abandon the black you might pick up a
B	you're not gonna
A	you're gonna pick up a
B	he'll have too many cards anyway now you're on six as it is
C	yeah
A	yeah so you may as well burn one
B	well no cos you can you you you'll pick up
A	if you can't
B	if you pick up a
A	if you can't cure red and black at the same time
B	no but if you pick up Algiers then cure it and then go for a red
A	be
C	yeah but I've gotta go
A	but er if it if this wasn't Legacy we would let Jakarta blow up
B	wait Jakarta would just rearrange so we get
A	no
B	two goes
A	that's coming two are coming on your go two are coming on dad's go then two are coming after
B	Karachi I mean
A	yeah
B	so
A	you can't do it because you are gonna take two from dad dad can't do it because he's gonna cure Milan and Essen cos he's right next to them and he can take six blue cubes off but mad for him to do it and
B	if some if I move down and then you like piggyback on me you just and we move
A	by the time by the time it's my turn
B	uhu
A	so one of you three need to cure it if you don't want it to explode like
C	I think so
A	you think it's important that he he does?
B	I think cos blue is
C	yeah
A	I think you're gonna get a black so you'd go and cure Jakarta then
A	yeah fly to Sydney
B	it's my go still isn't it?
A	but no but I'm saying that when it gets to
C	yeah
A	and then you could go if you're forgetting the red you could go to Bangkok and build a research station in Bangkok or fly out of Bangkok or er
C	yeah okay
D	yeah
A	so how are we how are we arranging these?
B	well
C	yeah but no he's
A	but dad's gonna do the
D	I've gotta do a
A	it's mad dad er so
B	yeah yeah to
A	so Jakarta's the last one cos
B	erm
A	or do you want? Karachi's gonna go to three as well
C	probably want it to be to be three last then don't we?
B	so yeah last and then
A	Karachi and Jakarta
B	Karachi
A	no?
B	yeah
A	what about Istanbul?
B	well
A	first because
B	Delhi Delhi will be on three as well
A	Istanbul first cos there are two people there now
C	uhu
B	get Istanbul there now
A	Beijing
B	Beijing yeah
A	Delhi and Hong Kong
B	yeah
A	so Delhi's
B	those three on three yeah
A	okay do you remember once when so we did this me and
B	and you put it back in the wrong order
A	so Istanbul's on top then Beijing then Delhi then Hong Kong
B	I see I see what you're doing yeah
A	then Karachi
B	yeah
A	then Jakarta
B	make sure they yeah I see right so I'm gonna take those two
A	one two three four
B	yeah I'm gonna take two more
A	blue would be great for you
B	black Mumbai and a blue Washington oh that's
C	right
C	right
B	I will also be infecting mm Delhi?
B	or Istanbul?
B	erm
A	cure two of them?
B	no it's two moves and Beijing
C	no it's not
A	oh it's different colours
C	well
A	one blue and black
C	oh is it?
B	I think yeah it is yeah
A	Beijing red
C	well don't that's worth double-checking
A	no I think he's right
C	yeah? oh
B	I'll just use the bathroom excuse me
C	no I think it er I think that is right
A	what is
C	yeah it was two
A	he's just allowed two
C	so now it's dad's go
D	so
A	cleaning the house
D	now what about these two while I'm here?
C	er you may
A	would you have enough turns
D	no
A	to do
C	well hang on sorry dad you could fly somewhere couldn't you just to get you in? where's Beijing?
A	no but the whole reason
D	thing is for me to get the blues
C	yeah you'll get you'll get the blues one
A	two
C	two three
A	three
C	four okay yeah sorry yeah yeah just yeah cure then
D	so
A	okay so it would be good if you got a yellow you've got two yellows dad now that would be brilliant
D	Montreal
C	both wasted cos
D	to
A	then he goes to three
C	okay then
A	no you're going to Jakarta
C	yeah
A	fly to Sydney
C	so it's Sydney one two and two off
A	or you can take one off Khartoum but yeah put two er
C	two off is it? that's pretty good
D	yeah
C	one
A	I can er
C	yeah
A	I can bring you to Istanbul and give you Istanbul
C	yeah ah okay red or black
A	okay you're fine then
C	I'm fine
A	you could go to Bangkok and build a research station or fly to er
C	yeah on my next go I'll go to Bangkok build a research station
A	but then we're losing reds like you're halfway to curing reds now as well that's the other thing
C	yeah
A	burning them okay
C	I'll sort that out okay
C	what about Washington? we're ignoring that
A	we
C	yeah we don't wanna
A	I can I can go there now
C	we'll hang out er
A	you don't need me to give you a sample now
C	no no
A	but I could go
C	but you but you can move dad around
D	take me to er
A	wherever
C	you could move dad
A	wherever
C	to Beijing
D	yes we do
A	I'm in Algiers actually now I'm in Algiers so I can go wherever I want I could go to Washington
C	it's all
A	but that's close to Khartoum
C	it's too close yeah you can
A	and bring if I build a if I one and build a station I can bring you there so it's easier for you but that's not
C	to cure it yeah
B	what do you think?
A	but no I've got a lot of so I'm in Algiers with the Algiers card so I can obviously fly to Washington Washington is coming out
C	yeah so if you do one
A	so that's the most important thing
C	two and then you could even move yourself back to somebody else's you could go back to say Istanbul or or over to Jakarta
B	how do you get to Jakarta?
A	cos there's two pawns that's in place
B	oh who was in Jakarta? the the
A	yeah
B	medic down there? or
C	no went to went to Sydney
A	no no we did well we said so dad took three off Milan three off
B	yeah
A	Essen
B	yeah and then
B	flew to Sydney and went up to Jakarta
C	and that's it is it?
D	no I'm gonna do different
B	multi-angle now
C	multi-angle oh okay
D	all these
C	oh my god
B	oh my god
D	go on then pretend I'm not here okay
A	okay right so I first what priority is Washington right? so I fly to Washington one two I can
B	we haven't cured anything though
A	I can go to Istanbul
C	but
A	and build a station in Istanbul I can move dad to Istanbul no point move dad to Washington could do could move dad to Jakarta
B	we've got a research
C	we've these are the problems there
A	I could move to Atlanta and bring
C	but you can also
A	or go to
C	uhu
B	I think
C	erm sorry
B	get you to a research centre and we can do it
C	you can move
B	or or me
C	you can move me one
B	just move one way
C	if you move me to Ho Chi Minh when dad finally
C	oh I was gonna say I wanted him to build
B	you can move me to a research centre so I can go
C	but what's the benefit of that?
B	I cure without moving
C	yeah
A	one
B	and it's it's more travel
A	build
B	it's more travel links
C	yeah but the the they're so close though
A	and then how is
B	you move to the the pawn
A	I can't I
C	so you went one two three
A	and build
B	why does he need to be there to cure?
A	cos he's got four ready to cure so how how else are you gonna get to there?
C	erm I was hoping that dad
A	no you can go to Bangkok and fly and you're just burning the reds
C	yeah but that's it we're losing the red there
B	have you already burned a red? oh yeah he did didn't you?
A	I think I think er we've got enough
C	okay
A	in there
C	okay
A	reds
B	right so now Delhi and er
A	er right so I want
B	and Delhi and Karachi are coming aren't they? well
A	no they
B	on two
A	no they they come out
B	based on three yeah yeah
A	so I want yellows
B	so
A	really here
B	right so you can
A	at the moment
C	yeah but use it with three
C	no that's
A	no no no that's come out now
C	it's done
B	oh
C	so this is new
B	yeah
A	Lima forgotten about that
B	one two
A	Buenos Aires
B	one two
C	thank you
D	alright
C	congratulations
B	yes congratulations
A	did you cure something?
B	yeah just cured the you
B	erm what shall shall we call it?
A	come on good girl
C	yeah it hasn't told us er maybe it will when we okay so focus so
B	that's one
C	one
B	I've got Mumbai you don't need any more blacks
C	er no
B	so I can fly to Mumbai and then treat one of Delhi or Karachi
A	bingo
B	yeah?
A	sorry what did you say?
[ANNOTATION]	They listened to what the others were saying	Contradiction
B	I've got Mumbai so I
A	it's useless now now
B	I so I can fly and then trade one of these two
C	yeah
A	sounds good
B	yeah?
C	they both come out
B	this which one's more linked?
A	Karachi?
C	I think they're the same
A	dad's closer to the to
[ANNOTATION]	B has been to Mumbai	Neutral
B	Delhi's Delhi's got more links
A	yeah
C	okay
[ANNOTATION]	Delhi hasn't got more links	Contradiction
B	right two more?
C	yeah
B	I'll take er Manilla so I can give that to you
A	good if
B	take it
C	uhu
A	so you've just got
C	yeah
A	into the same city
[ANNOTATION]	B is flying to Delhi in a few months	Neutral
C	yeah yeah
A	which you're gonna go to anyway
C	yeah
A	so on
C	okay
A	so yellow's the only problem here cos we know we're nowhere on yellows
C	okay infect?
B	yeah
A	Essen
[ANNOTATION]	Essen is infected with the pandemic	Neutral
C	okay Khartoum's on two oh
unknown	oh
B	easy
C	take this now it's your go
B	where are you? there
D	now is it worth getting there Essen? or
A	I think so
D	am I needed in Washington?
[ANNOTATION]	Their only problem right now is blue	Contradiction
A	so you're so
B	and any time you walk in enter a city with a cured disease it disappears because you're a medic
D	okay
B	technically
D	so I could
A	no cos he's got to enter
B	yeah
D	could I go to Washington then?
B	you could go to Washington via New York
D	via New New York
A	no but that's one two three and it's that's not a priority cos it's on two well
D	Montreal and St Petersburg
A	just move to wherever you want
D	okay
C	mm
D	so to anywhere?
B	we could eradicate blue
A	not going to eradicate blue
B	no
A	anyway
D	okay
C	oh hang on sorry dad as a medic can just pass through them
A	yeah but there's
C	is there any chance to
A	no there's about six or six or seven different cities with blues on
B	yeah I mean one two three four takes off four
C	but it's
A	I don't think realistically you'll cure it if it's
B	no
A	but flying out to St Petersburg probably gonna be
D	okay so
B	one two
D	one
B	yeah
D	and we're two
B	maybe
A	well we've got
B	South America
D	and I go
B	because nobody's done
A	so that's one
B	no
A	and you fly so you could Karachi's on three
D	mm okay
A	Buenos Aires is on two Khartoum's on two and Johannesburg's on two
B	I think it would be sensible to get into South America so we've got somebody there in case you need so you can just move them to like if we have somebody on each continent then you can dispatch them so some
D	okay so
B	so wherever
D	so
A	is it
D	Buenos
A	okay
D	three
A	keep going to
C	but we know that Buenos Aires isn't coming up again for a while
A	yeah I dunno if Buenos Aires as
C	that's
A	then it happens the only thing on the board that's gonna explode is Karachi
B	but that's black's getting cured next go
A	yeah yeah
B	so er we can cure it you can take all those off in one
A	yeah no you
D	yeah
A	yeah you're you if when when black is cured by
B	I just go one two
A	yeah
B	yeah you're right
D	so I go one more left go Joburg
A	yeah cos then you're one away from a research station and
D	yeah
A	and you can take two off
B	cool
D	that's that's
B	that's it that's your four
A	so we want yellows really now
B	take a couple of yellows please
D	Hong Kong
B	that's not a yellow so try again
D	Cairo
B	it's definitely there oh yeah
A	no problem
B	and do some damage
D	Mumbai
B	it's er
C	er lucky to get that one
D	and Cairo
C	that's good
C	er
D	turn it off then yeah
B	we've got enough er wide-angled stuff I'll go in for some close-ups next time
D	yeah you I've gotta do close-ups
C	okay
B	you are in er Jakarta
C	so how am I getting somewhere?
B	you can fly from er
A	you're using Bangkok
B	Bangkok yeah
C	right oh yeah
B	so one which one shall I go to?
A	you're gonna get you're gonna be with
C	er
B	I am in Delhi
A	you wanna get to
C	okay so I'll go here then
A	two
C	three
A	so you could take one off Jakarta
C	yeah
B	before he left yeah?
A	no?
C	yeah
D	so you think that we're doing badly see to me I think we're doing well
A	well we're doing well
B	we are
A	with the cards we've been given
B	well we are
A	but we've
B	we are infecting the board quite heavily in that first round
C	er we we're fifty percent and we're halfway through I think
A	we're doing
B	uhu
A	we're nowhere on yellows at all
B	no but we're two off of
A	right we're well we're one move off
B	we're close to red
C	yeah yeah
A	so hopefully
B	and go to and not an epidemic
C	yes yeah Riyadh
A	so these are new ones now
C	yeah
B	uhu
C	erm I don't think that's
unknown	oh
A	leave Hong Kong alone
C	and it's just two wasn't it?
A	just two
B	just two yeah
A	oh right so
B	mm
A	well
B	well you move if you move er
A	I don't wanna leave you there
B	on my first go
A	when you go through
B	yeah
A	one
B	yeah
A	I wanna leave dad where he is for Joburg
B	look at all this power you have as the
A	yeah I'm quite enjoying it actually
B	dispatcher see? I told you it's the best
A	yeah yeah I'm the midfield general just kind of I'm Bremner
B	you're like
A	he does try hard doesn't he? right so I wanna leave that there
C	uhu well I still wanna do that but shall we move them really?
A	I've got
C	one two three
A	or fly yeah
C	you could fly yeah cos er you know
A	no point me flying to Karachi really is there?
C	well it is cos you can take one off
A	no cos because if it's
B	no because it's not coming off
A	cured then
C	he's gonna give me two yes so you can do that as well
A	yeah but if
C	and he yeah
A	one to you two three four
C	you only can give me one
B	I give you I'm gonna give you two yeah?
C	no you're gonna give me one
B	have you got two?
C	oh no no two yeah
B	you need two yeah
A	one two three so he can't do that actually so I'd fly to Karachi
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	one two three
B	it's not cured yet is it? oh it is yeah yeah
A	and then I could I could take off
C	and you may as well take
B	a blue or a
A	or a black would not a million miles away from curing I don't think we're realistically cure it were we?
C	oh yeah we're not gonna do any of this
A	alright
B	we could actually eradicate black but
A	okay so er
B	Riyadh where are the yellows to infect?
A	Lagos
C	oh
B	right so I'll go one two
C	thank you
B	three
C	oh hang on so oh it's too late now it's
D	oh
A	no I you had to stay there to
C	yeah yeah okay yeah I've
A	you could fly to LA now
C	yeah but it's er it's well
A	it's your yeah it's your turn now
B	Essen's two away
D	can I just say I'm I'm in erm Joburg can't I build a research station on my go?
B	you'd need yeah you'd need to have this yeah
A	yeah it's just not a good position really it's
C	cos it's right next to
A	and it's not connected
B	I'm gonna go towards
A	so what have you done
B	I just well two
A	one two
B	cured three
A	three
B	and then I'll move closer to Hong Kong
A	don't you wanna be in this? don't you wanna end in a city with someone because you can they can take from you?
C	but you haven't got any
B	I've got nothing to take no
A	no but you're gonna take two cards now aren't you?
B	uhu so I'll go down to you
A	yeah
C	okay
B	yeah?
C	mm
B	type A
B	okay
A	we're doing okay actually aren't we? we're nowhere on yellows that's the problem
C	yeah
B	at least then yellows are still a mess so yeah what what do you wanna do?
D	well shall I try and clean up a few of the yellows around there
C	yeah
D	as I as I'm there?
C	yeah Joburg
D	so Joberg is one move
B	uhu
D	two shall I leave that or?
A	I'd leave that you could go directly to
C	to three
A	you could do that on one though
C	yeah
D	oh okay sorry three now do you want me to try
A	no you're right actually if you go one one
C	no
A	two three and just end in Khartoum
D	well I've got one move there I'm in Khartoum and I've got one move there
A	yeah but I'm saying if you go one two
C	yeah but that's
A	three
C	that that's only
A	okay yeah yeah yeah
C	and then you can you can hop to Atlanta
D	that's what I was just gonna say
A	mm
D	if I went to Atlanta now with my last turn
C	mm
B	you'd automatically cure Atlanta
D	yeah
C	mm
D	and I'm in the right place for
B	yeah
D	okay what do I need now?
B	anything yellows?
C	yeah
D	Bogota and epidemic
A	we have we've been a while without one haven't we?
C	oh it's on three
A	alright then
B	but it we've got quite a lot of er there's nothing
D	so
D	er
B	shall I shuffle these?
A	I think we're I think we're winning
D	I think so
B	it's just how much it's
A	how much
C	I mean
A	no I know that
C	you know
A	I we were really unlucky like having another start up but
C	but yeah I
A	no
C	it's that's
A	yeah
C	you know that's the game isn't it? and it's I'm properly I'm paying I'm properly paying attention
A	yeah and that's what you would
B	we don't need to play that
A	we don't need to play that now but then
C	nothing's on
A	the only
A	Seoul Seoul is the only one
C	yeah so no not now
A	but I don't I don't foresee a time with us having to play that in the rest of the game either
B	you don't know what there could be another epidemic next round
C	okay so
B	it's infect three
A	Moscow
A	oh so
C	Seoul and it's
A	that was about one in fourteen as well
B	Beijing is on three
A	it's quite it's not well connected so that's alright
B	er
A	alright we really don't want Beijing now then
C	oh yeah when we could have played quiet night couldn't we? but
B	not that it
A	did say did say
B	I don't think you can play it on an epidemic
A	you can play it at any time
[ANNOTATION]	you can play whenever	Entailment
C	yeah okay
B	so it's going on a Osaka?
A	alright in
B	what was that two?
C	yeah
B	watch Beijing come up
C	oh
A	Taipei
[ANNOTATION]	no one comes up	Contradiction
B	yeah we've got a problem this area
A	we've got
B	goes off
A	we've got a problem
B	quick
C	so
C	my go isn't it?
A	well you've gotta get me to a research station
B	we should probably play one quiet night after this
C	yeah okay so we're erm
B	we need to cure that but immediately
C	one two
A	you don't want to fly why don't you use Essen cos blues are nothing now?
[ANNOTATION]	we need to solve this	Entailment
C	what do you mean? I'm here
A	fly to Essen
C	well Essen oh
B	yeah
C	was I?
A	is it is it the same? one
[ANNOTATION]	do not fly to Essen	Contradiction
C	yeah
A	it's the same is it?
C	one two three one two three
B	okay
A	mm
C	but you're right well
B	get in and just
A	no difference no difference is there?
B	yeah just in and cure it and then you can fly out of Essen
A	and take a
C	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	there is nothing in Essen	Neutral
B	well it's done one left
A	you've got one move
B	I say
C	do I want take a new can I give who's
A	you're both over there why don't you fly why don't you fly to Atlanta?
[ANNOTATION]	you are at different places	Contradiction
B	but you need to be
A	possibly
B	you need to be in
A	somehow get to it
B	in one of those cities to to give it to him Khartoum? anyone got Khartoum?
A	if dad if dad finishes his turn in LA I can move you to LA with him when that's my turn that mm
B	these yellows are gonna
C	I
B	be a problem
C	I can go and I can go to Essen and then fly out at
A	you you can't it's Essen's too
C	oh
A	you can move one towards Essen
C	yeah and then if dad ends his turn in LA in in LA so dad would go one
A	you could fly of yeah two
C	two three four it's a bit circuitous
A	blue automatically
C	three four yeah and then end in LA I mean it's a bit of a nothing but you
A	I mean we'll see what happens now anyway because I might get a some yellows that I can you know yeah I think you may as well go to Milan then
C	yeah okay I will just to but I you know hopefully I you know I might get a couple of yellows so
A	yeah that's yeah that's the best thing
C	research station
A	that
B	research station anywhere
A	you I'd use that now
C	no no no
B	do we wanna go one quiet night?
A	it's that if it
A	if you have it early
C	yeah
A	if you have it later it's a
C	yeah
A	complete waste of a card
C	okay so three
B	one quiet night?
C	yeah
A	yeah? do you want to?
B	well I'm just thinking if what's it's
C	I don't see
B	Seoul's Seoul's not gonna come out
A	no two next to each other is mad
B	is Beijing gonna come out?
A	we were gonna play I don't think I I really don't think we're gonna play it in the rest of the game otherwise but are we gonna cure in the next turn? am I gonna I could fly to Osaka
B	it's cured I mean that's it we've cured it so anybody in there can treat that
A	or er no I can go to Riyadh and go directly there so I reckon play it like that
B	well I can you can take this and you can fly directly there I can give you either one of those
C	express
A	yeah?
B	yeah
C	and then
A	okay
B	because
A	so we're
B	well
A	not gonna infect because of that bonus card okay
B	which one do you want?
A	so I'll fly
B	why don't you
A	no no that's mad though
A	no I'm better off
B	right
A	just flying to
B	to Osaka
A	to go to Riyadh one
C	don't forget you wanna be moving me close to dad where er dad oh of course
A	no you're gonna fly out of Essen
C	yeah okay
A	so one to Riyadh
B	yeah
A	two wherever it wants Beijing's gonna come out now
B	uhu
A	three
B	uhu
A	end up in Seoul
B	uhu
A	because I'm like erm er we're all like medics now if it's cured so I can take three off Beijing through one action
B	as well
A	right I
C	yeah
A	we want yellows really
B	course you're gonna get yellows
C	no we can probably stop now
D	yeah
C	we've done nearly two hours
A	go and get it up to an hour
B	so just just get yeah get up to another hour
D	another hour?
C	another ten minutes
B	oh you just pulled an epidemic card?
A	epidemic the epidemic
B	oh
A	so this we're on the
C	yeah
B	yeah and look what
A	okay this see he's gonna get
B	look this these are gonna get infected those three
A	yeah
B	the same three we
A	I should have gone for Seoul then
C	well
A	no cos Beijing for the
C	yeah yeah
A	yeah right
C	Shanghai
B	how was that the bottom card from the
A	Beijing explodes
C	cos er cos
B	yeah yeah
C	five
A	no double explosion
C	is that on three?
A	yeah
C	okay hang on erm
A	hang on hang on
C	yeah two
A	two so then Seoul
C	wait
A	Seoul infects Beijing and Tokyo
C	but how many times has Beijing got is Beijing on two now?
A	no Beijing has never exploded
A	Seoul is on two Shanghai is on one
B	is on one yeah
A	but we're gonna be honestly could really lose this game look we've got four agencies on red
B	yeah but they're secured
A	red alert
B	so we just need to get someone to
A	we need to get dad there really
D	well I can get there next time
C	well we're yeah but I'm trying to
A	we've got to win the game
C	so
B	can't yeah we can't do this for naught can we?
C	so two two means no direct no direct flights in or out
A	or never but the good thing
C	and existing ones
A	you never would
C	would be destroyed
B	alright do you wanna put one on Shanghai cos it went off?
C	we've just got Shanghai had
A	er yeah we haven't done then yet
B	yeah
A	er yeah no one should go on Shanghai
C	yeah and it's four cards
B	no we don't lose the game
A	yeah we do
B	we we've just done we just did what we did
A	we'd have two outbreaks and we'll lose the game
C	that and we got we've got three we've got a
A	uhu
B	yeah
C	out of how many?
A	four
B	uhu
C	well we've lost then
A	no because it could not be Shanghai
C	yeah but it it wait it
B	but it will be
C	it'll probably be
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a is chinese	Neutral
A	has anyone got a
B	well if it's Beijing er any any one of those
A	any of those agencies apart from Beijing when we?
C	this is where we wanted quiet night
A	okay so game over Seoul gets to another there's rioting
B	so
A	so anyway so Seoul explodes so we've got to put that on so we've got to go through Beijing so that goes onto seven
B	that's one
A	to three Tokyo goes to four Tokyo explodes Shanghai explodes and it's game over
B	Tokyo because it's
C	Tokyo yeah
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about cities in Africa	Contradiction

A	we got battered we got
B	it's just
C	that cluster
B	they're so closely they're so close
A	that came from nowhere though really didn't it? and we
D	don't don't discuss it anymore cos I'll finish off by doing an interview with you er in the form of a football interview about what went on yeah?
