B	because when I turn them on
A	if you put them all on
B	I couldn't get the one on in the room in the bedroom
A	oh
B	I mean it you can feel it underneath on the pipe but it's hot
A	and it's not
B	when you turn it
A	it's not
B	yeah that's what I that's probably they've sat there and not been used then that's the sort of thing
A	oh
C	it's handy
B	yes thank you both
C	there you are
B	thank you
C	erm you know cos if anything goes wrong
B	yes
B	that's right
C	good
B	mm lovely salmon
C	well it's a treat isn't it? I
B	mm
C	I love smoked salmon as well
B	mm
C	so I'm doing a coast walk tomorrow
B	mm
C	because I I've got till end of July to finish the coast path
B	yes
C	for the south west so I want to get on with it cos I've had a couple of months off
B	mm
C	get to
B	that's nice
C	well I haven't been to
B	mm it's very nice
C	and the other side of
B	oh yes mm
C	oh is there?
B	mm
C	because you went there with
B	yes and I went there for training with the youth hostel
C	oh did you?
B	mm
C	oh right okay
B	mm it's very pretty
C	grandpa's been there twice with
B	mm
C	to a hotel that he used to go with grandma
B	mm
C	that's nice
B	good
C	so he's going out to the bed
B	mm
C	and
B	that's nice
C	yes
B	mm
C	so this week we've been fairly busy then
B	yes
C	good
B	yes exactly
C	yes
B	mm slept on the bed
C	on the bed? was that mattress reasonable?
B	mm it's fine mm
C	oh is it? okay
B	yeah
C	and you have a plenty
B	mm mm
C	it's good
B	plenty warm enough
C	it's good
B	lots of hot water for the shower that was good
C	oh and that's nice
B	yes
C	and that that amazes me because you've got all those people there and yet it doesn't you don't see a lot of people around or many cars driving about
B	my street hardly anyone's moved in
B	but even when you go out
C	yeah that's it it's surprising isn't it?
B	mm
C	it's strange
B	mm
C	the only I went for a walk when dad was fixing up your bed and I the only people who were around were a few mothers walking obviously taking their children to school or playschool somewhere
B	mm
C	that was it
B	I haven't been in
C	no
B	I didn't want to do a big shop there
C	no no but anyway it'd be handy if you ran out
B	Co-op's not got the huge range
C	ah
B	I mean it's not a megastore cos I wanted to do one big shop
C	yes
B	yes I mean that's all price matched isn't it?
C	yes
B	mm
C	I was told I was an amazing person yesterday
B	oh by
B	does he tell everyone?
C	once to me and I didn't know what she was on about cos we just think of ourselves as we are no we met dad's
B	oh yes
C	no no er he works with
B	yeah right
C	and we had a coffee after the swim and I started telling her about the coast path and cycling the Hebrides different things and she
B	oh that's nice
C	oh this is good
B	that's nice
B	mm
C	be not many people quite
B	mm
A	your car's done
B	low isn't it?
A	well yes mine's on seventy-three
B	yes I must get it serviced though when I turn it on it says service now
C	oh does it?
B	but it doesn't have any warning lights on when I'm driving
A	no but that's
B	so I think it just you know they're clever aren't they? they know
B	mm
A	when it did the last service
B	mm
A	and it's obviously
B	so I think that's all it is but
A	yeah
B	I must do it anyway but it it sounds fine
B	it's going along and it's getting
B	no like soap like Fairy looks like Fairy washing up liquid soap it's not foam it's
A	yes
B	I'll take it in and get the valet done but
C	yes it's probably
B	for the inside it's worth doing isn't it?
B	you can never get it the same with a hoover
C	no and even if you just have it
A	no
C	done the once
B	mm
C	and then do it yourself after that
A	is it self-service valet or they do it?
B	no proper
A	does it say the
A	yeah
C	and has it all done I
B	I think once cos you just can't get the seats right yourself
A	no
B	you can never do it
C	and it was in a pretty bad state really wasn't it?
A	upholstery
B	inside it needs doing properly
B	I thought there's no point doing that until the service was done
A	no
B	they might get oil
A	yeah
C	yes
B	I mean they try and be careful but
C	yes
A	yeah
C	see I don't think I told you the story
B	no
C	erm it wasn't working so
B	oh really?
C	he said I've never seen a dishwasher like it
C	he said the only thing I can think of is that your father's been putting washing powder in from the washing machine
B	oh no
C	instead of dishwasher tablets
C	but anyway it's still working a month later
B	good
A	did he
C	he had to
A	clean clean it
C	getting it all out and he'd never met anything in his working life like this
B	oh dear
C	what else he's put in there
A	and that was the washing machine was it? or
C	that was the dishwasher
A	that was the dishwasher
C	it was about a hundred and thirty pounds but it was still cheaper than a lot of
B	yes
C	than buying it
B	oh dear
C	mm
A	yeah
B	a hundred and fifty new
C	your what?
B	washing machine
C	ah yes so this was the dishwasher
B	dishwasher's probably more though
A	dishwasher is closer to three hundred
B	yeah
C	yes well that's
A	say two fifty on this
B	it's a lot isn't it?
C	it is
B	washing machine that's very reasonable
C	yes
A	yes
B	actually a very good price but
A	I wouldn't feel bad if you know
B	no that lasted two years and it broke I wouldn't feel bad about that
C	the washing machine
A	yeah they got better
B	that's very good mm
A	they've they've got better in the last ten years
B	yes that's very good yes things
C	that's good
B	quite old cars here
C	yes yes
B	they're built to last things like Volkswagen they're very good
C	and your fridge freezer I mean that should last for years and years and years
B	yes that should last
A	yes
C	cos we threw out
B	yes
C	a chest freezer erm
B	no
C	you know I think we've gone indefinitely with that sort of
B	yeah that's very good
C	it's good
A	it doesn't mean you won't have to
B	yes that's why I wanted a bigger one
C	yes
B	yes in terms of being able to freeze things that's useful
A	can you reach the top shelf?
B	yes I mean that's fine for me
A	yeah
B	in terms of being able to freeze stuff that is useful cos you can cook then
A	yes cos
B	two things at the weekend and freeze it
A	yes
B	and then not have to eat the same food
A	yes
B	cos that's horrible so you need some freezer space that you
C	yes
B	don't have to
A	and you can fill the fridge up with bottles can't you?
B	that's what I thought to make it full you can you know by the time you've bought
A	even if it's just
B	you know soft drinks like cans of
A	keep a few beers in there
B	yes exactly just permanently keep beer and
A	you know just to fill the space because and then it just
C	mm
B	and soft drinks in there that actually takes up a lot of room
C	yeah to stand things
B	yes
C	upright as well if you want
B	that's right
C	and you've had a big expense now
B	yes that's right
C	because you think in five or ten years time oh yeah perhaps I will have another settee
B	no
C	yeah
B	that's right no it it's a one-off isn't it?
B	yes
C	then you don't have old
B	that's right
A	so if you moved out of your house
B	yes
B	yeah
A	and they won't fit the new place anyway
B	no there's no point is there?
A	and then you often get to a new place and they decided to leave them there as part of the price
B	yes
C	yeah we've often had carpets that have just been there like here there's we did have to buy a lot but there's two or three previous ones
B	yes that's good
C	there was nothing wrong with it it's pointless having another one
B	no
C	yes and this was expensive so
B	yes
C	and those carpets grandpa's got
B	they've had those forever haven't they? yes
C	there's nothing wrong with them they look really nice don't they?
B	no they're good
A	and they've had reasonable wear
C	yes they have
A	you know like in the
C	yes
A	where everybody goes on that one square yard
B	mm
A	erm well the doorway into the lounge it was gonna wear anywhere it would have worn there
B	yes
B	yes it's good isn't it?
B	that's right I thought that yes
B	yes
B	yes and
C	yes
B	yes
C	no
B	yes
C	yes
B	good
C	so we've heard from
B	ah right
C	and he's enjoying it with
B	oh right
C	and
B	oh that's good
C	which is good news so five pounds six
B	mm
C	so they normally put on an ounce a day so I was thinking that's an awfully long time before they get to a normal birth weight isn't it?
B	yes
A	yeah
C	you know we're like a month
B	yes yes
C	so anyway it's good news they're getting on alright
B	yes that's good
C	mm
A	yeah
B	no
C	mm
B	I know
C	yes but
C	well no it's
B	today
C	oh was it? ah
B	yesterday things were open but limited hours
C	okay
B	like late
A	well I looked
B	open very late and closed by four
C	yes
B	but yes
[ANNOTATION]	Something was open the previous day for 5 hours.	Neutral
A	and the electrical shop is open in the square
B	ah yes
A	but erm like some of them even the big ones they're treating today as Boxing Day
B	ah yes
A	Boxing Day to get all the sales people
B	yes
A	but that was on a Saturday
B	ah right
[ANNOTATION]	The Boxing Day was on Saturday.	Entailment
A	so they've been
B	yeah so tomorrow they said back to normal
A	yeah to shop hours yeah
B	yes
C	oh was it? oh right
B	yes
C	I used to go to that one
B	ah yes well they're doing free haircuts Tuesday mornings
C	Tuesday mornings?
B	yeah
C	are they? what? with a trainee?
B	yes
B	supervised
C	that's good
[ANNOTATION]	The next day all shops will be open for limited hours.	Contradiction
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Free haircuts are only for women.	Neutral
B	the number
C	what? the posh one in the centre?
B	yeah the posh one
C	mm that's interesting
A	mm
B	yes
C	oh I might go in there
B	yeah you have to book it you have to go
[ANNOTATION]	The posh is in the outskirts.	Contradiction
C	oh right okay
B	and then short hair
C	oh well I'll try cos it was very expensive it cost me twenty-three pounds there for a haircut
B	mm
C	when I can get it for eleven pounds where I went before and I thought oh why am I paying for this? it wasn't any better
B	no
C	the difference was they gave you more time and a nice cup of coffee
B	yes
C	erm and then a massage chair and I thought well you know
B	yes well if it's free it's even better
C	well yes it is
B	yes
C	erm two things then one I think you've responded to this so we're going for the walk on Thursday
B	Thursday yes
C	yes
B	that sounds good
C	and the weather looks reasonable might get a bit of rain
B	ah yes
C	it's a good long walk
B	oh yes
C	and uphill a lot at the beginning
A	yes
C	yes and we got lost so
B	ah yes
C	go the right way this time
B	and
C	yes and
B	so yeah
C	and then we'll have lunch at
A	yeah
B	oh thank you
C	so that'll be nice
B	nice
A	and then we've only got two-mile walk downhill
B	ah yes it's better downhill
C	yes it's lovely after lunch it's really nice
B	yes
A	so you do five
B	yes
A	and two after lunch I think that's the
C	yes
A	right amount
B	yeah
C	and then I don't know if you got my message on your phone
B	oh right
C	and it looked very nice
B	oh good
C	er so I've picked I was waiting for one you know how things stand out?
B	yes
C	so I don't know if you'd like to do this with us?
B	yes
C	and it was a two-hour safari by boat
B	oh lovely
C	going from
B	oh yes that sounds lovely
C	we thought it sounded really nice it's not something I
B	yes
C	no not for grandpa because he'll get cold on the boat so
B	no okay cos of the boat
C	it's no good asking him cos he'll say yes to every but it's insensible because he
B	no
C	it's the cold's the worst one
B	yes
C	erm so we've
B	yes yes that would be nice
C	yes and then I thought of one for grandpa
B	yes we need something for him
C	because it's very limited what you can do with grandpa
B	yes that's right
C	so I thought we've done it before but I think it would make a nice day out
B	oh yes that would be nice
C	from
B	yes that's nice yes he'd like that
C	oh that's good so that'd be nice
B	oh good yes
C	there's er two summer ones
B	yes
C	and then there'll probably still something left to be honest
B	yes there probably would be yes
B	you're welcome
B	it's nice
C	yes
B	to choose something
C	yes and I don't if dad doesn't want to come on the railway then he might be able to choose one on his own that he wanted to do
B	yes that's right yes
C	you know like cos there were lots of men-type things weren't there?
B	yes there's more I
C	like going on
B	racing cars
C	yes
C	but then you could go to
B	ah yes
C	and
B	ah yes
C	but but I think you've been
B	the
B	I've never been there actually
C	oh you haven't? oh
B	oh that'll be nice I didn't look for Cornwall actually yes I looked in Devon
C	well there's that and again not with grandpa because he can't walk anywhere but
B	no
C	erm
B	I would like to go there I mean it would have to be a summer thing wouldn't it? it would be a bit boring going now
A	yeah
C	yes
B	I mean it would have the greenhouses but it's like Kew isn't it? a lot of it's outside so
C	yeah
A	yes
C	and what was nice on this particular one they gave you cakes and things I thought was quite
B	oh that's nice
C	well we all like that
B	yes I'd like to do that yes
C	well if we run out cos
B	oh thank you
C	cos we haven't been and we've been saying for eight years we'd go
B	yes I'd like to go
B	yes
C	yes it's one of those things you want to do once don't you?
B	yes that's right yeah
C	and if you cycle in just leave your car a mile away
B	oh yes that's right so we should all cycle so we should take several cars
B	park a mile away and then quickly cycle in
C	yes
B	would that be okay if I put that in the car tomorrow?
A	yes
C	are you alright about the brakes?
B	well I'll I'll take it to Halfords for you and get them fixed
A	oh yeah
B	cos I think they do need
A	yeah
C	alright otherwise you can borrow mine
B	ah yes
A	yeah
B	at least if you don't mind? that'd be nice
A	no take take mine
B	well I think I do need to fix the
A	and you know where the Halfords is cos
B	brakes
A	yeah
B	it's a bit of a fiddle doing it it was hard wasn't it?
A	yes
B	getting the tension right and
A	yes
B	so it doesn't rub on
A	yeah yeah
B	the
A	erm
B	well in the house for now in the kitchen
A	you don't mind yeah
B	there's no
A	there there's plenty of you know it folds in half
B	there's actually plenty of room in the kitchen
A	and
A	oh yes yeah if you put that
B	if you just put a rug down
A	put that red rug or something down just to protect the floor
B	that's actually a very good place to put a fold up bike
A	you don't
C	yes
A	yes I agree and and you can lift it
B	you can exactly
A	if you fold it all up in the kitchen and then lift it through
B	yes
A	I think so yes
B	no
C	no
B	no I think it takes up too much
C	yeah okay
B	no to be honest they can go under the sink can't they? the small things
C	yes
A	yeah
B	trowel or
A	yeah
B	you know
C	or otherwise you can get little mole things can't you for the garden?
B	yes
B	no
C	yes
A	yeah oh yes
B	you could easily put a spade you could just have a garden spade in there
A	yes
C	yes
A	it's like having a broom isn't it?
B	yes that's right
A	in your cupboard yeah
C	so a fold up bike's the answer rather than getting a
C	yes
B	yeah
C	oh I should have to get a cover or something and then you don't really like leaving it out anyway in all weathers do you?
B	no
C	the I mean my fold up bikes goes
B	yeah
C	mm
B	yes that's good
C	ah yes
A	and the
B	ah very nice
A	the map was that so
B	ah yes
A	all the way back to
B	yes
A	so you've done that proportion
B	ah yes that's nice that's nice after lunch
A	well yeah
B	mm mm
C	have you got
B	I don't know where they are I do have somewhere here
B	ah I know where that is I've got that in the car but I don't know where the trousers
C	don't know
B	maybe in that chest by
C	okay
B	they
C	well you can have a look cos I think we'll get away without a new
B	yes and I've got the walking boots that's good
C	that's good
B	yes
B	yeah
A	you'll drive from your house to
A	okay
C	yes
A	erm
C	you
A	there's a road called
B	right is that easy to find?
A	and it leads uphill
B	right
A	the old railway station
C	so as you come into
B	which way? coming from
C	from
B	yes
C	at the first turning
B	yes
C	you turn left at the second set of traffic lights in the town
B	so you go pretty much past all the shops then? cos the first set on the downhill and there's that camera isn't there?
A	yes
B	so you go past the first set and the camera
A	yes
B	and then you go sort of down into a valley don't you?
A	through a set of pedestrian crossing ones by Specsavers
B	yes by
A	okay and then
B	and then it starts to go uphill after that doesn't it?
A	yes
B	but there's a road off to the left before that there
C	yes that's
A	yes
B	oh right yeah
C	and there's a post office there
B	ah right
C	and yes well on the
B	on the other side
A	on the corner
C	on
A	it's the
B	oh right
A	there's a big pub
C	ah yes the
A	and it actually says there's a sign that says
B	yes
C	so you go past the hotel and turn left
B	yes so it's just at the bottom of the hill
A	well it's before the
C	ah before the
B	oh it's before the
A	yes
B	okay
A	it's on the corner of the
B	yes
A	before the
B	yes okay alright we'll I'll find it
C	it's
A	yep
B	yes so I'll just keep driving
A	yeah no so we're in when you turn left so you're there at traffic lights
B	yes
A	you turn left
B	yes
A	then the
B	yes
A	there's a road off on to your right called
B	right
A	and that's the way to go
C	and then what
B	okay so I go left at the traffic light
A	after about a hundred
A	yes
B	yes
C	and you just need to find somewhere to park then we shall see but
B	yes
A	to to
C	street
A	halfway up that road
B	ah right
A	the parking gets better
B	oh right okay that's good
A	it's a residential road
B	yes
A	and it's before there's a very small Catholic church on your left it's before that
B	ah right okay right I'm sure I'll find it
A	and if you've gone that far you can turn round
B	yes
A	and come back down
B	ah right okay so that's good
C	anyway no more details you'll get muddled up
B	no that's fine er what time shall we meet?
C	er
A	well if you wanted to be lunch for half twelve
B	ah yes that's right yes need to be there
A	and I think it said five miles
B	no that's okay how long do you think it takes to drive from
A	to there?
C	about an hour
B	about an hour
A	oh no it'd be an hour to the house
C	I I'd allow an hour
B	an hour okay so quarter past eight well I guess that's fine
C	well yes
B	in work
C	yes say quarter past nine and then if we got there for twelve o'clock for lunch that's fine
A	yeah
B	yes that's true
B	and did you think about tomorrow? I said to mum in some ways it's perhaps silly of us to take two cars
C	yes
A	yes
B	but I could drive us both
A	mm yeah
B	in my car
A	yes
B	and then I can
A	well you could yep
B	or we can yes
A	no no that'd be better
B	and then
A	not
B	we can go wherever we're going not have to worry about meeting up
A	yeah
B	and then on the way back I can drive you into
A	it'd be it picks the bus
B	yes since there's no train
A	so the bus would go either from
A	yes
B	cos if it's raining at least
A	oh yeah yeah precisely there or the railway station they're the two stops
B	yes you can go to well yes the railway station's
A	whatever's best for traffic
B	yes
B	yes
C	yes you don't
B	yes
B	yes
A	so there or something
B	yes doesn't matter though it's really not far into
A	no that would be very helpful thank you
B	that's if you're happy to do that
A	yes
B	do you get free bus travel now?
A	yes
B	oh even better
C	yeah
A	yeah
B	that's good
B	yes
A	erm
B	and I did think
A	yes
B	but that's good
A	yeah
C	and that suits
B	check the legs come off in which case we have to take something like an Allen key which'll be for tables isn't it underneath? cos you normally take the legs off
A	yeah
B	those sort of tables
A	no no
B	do you have those? they'll probably have them in store to be honest cos otherwise how would they get them in the door
A	I've got
B	it's
A	yes
B	it's pretty unlikely that it'll go through the front door
B	but yes that's and then I did want to show you the British Heart one
A	ah yeah
A	when you do
B	when I drop you
A	drop you off yeah
B	off because I can always put it in the back of the car
A	yeah
B	they shut at five thirty
B	they are normal opening hours tomorrow
A	ah
B	nine thirty till five thirty
C	yes
A	yes
B	so I could show you that and show you the sofas very a bit like yours
A	and
B	yes well that hospice shop in
A	yeah
C	cos I'm not sure if you want to
B	it might be nine thirty
C	want to check it could be nine thirty don't know
B	yes
A	ah
B	I can't remember
A	oh yes
B	might be nine thirty but we could leave here by nine fifteen say to leave
A	yes yes
B	there for nine thirty
A	so so
B	well we're only gonna stop I mean if it's not good cos I couldn't see properly
A	yes
B	I just thought oh it's pine but I couldn't see well enough to see
A	no
B	if it's scratched or
A	no and then
B	not very good
A	let's
B	it's probably earlier to be honest
A	then we'd be at the Screwfix place quarter to
B	well let's leave here at
B	oh can you? oh right
C	that's not it's very good here
B	and it should be quiet and
C	yes
A	at that time of day
B	yeah okay so nine fifteen's okay then
A	yeah
B	nine thirty
A	ten thirty
A	be at your place
B	doesn't take long
A	right and then get started and see what we get done quarter past ten
B	yes
C	oh that's good
A	yes
B	and then we could go into
A	yeah
C	yes
A	I'll just
B	and the sofa oh and I asked them about delivery erm
A	yeah
C	oh
B	erm the chairs we can always hold them for you as a
A	yeah
C	yes
A	yes you could do like two on one trip in er
B	yes
A	no
B	so they said it's twenty pounds delivery
A	yeah
B	you can fill a van with as much stuff as you want for that price
A	well yes so that's
B	er but it's twenty pounds flat fee
A	yeah
B	so if you did get sofas from there
B	and they have chest of drawers and things as well
A	yeah
C	they deliver to where for twenty pounds?
C	do they? really? from here?
