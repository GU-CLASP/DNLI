A	okay
B	how long ago do you think how long?
A	well it's over ten years isn't it?
B	really? I don't really I know it's not a consistent thing we've done is it? you have more than me but it's it I don't really seem to be any further forward
A	well I'm sure we are a little but then
B	don't think I am
A	we first started erm going to Spanish classes when we were going to go to Argentina for a holiday
B	and that was two thousand and five wasn't it?
A	two thousand and three
B	wasn't it? so it's over ten years
A	mm
B	oh
A	mm
B	yeah
A	and then we've done things like listen to cassettes and the Michel Thomas CDs
B	I had those Michel Thomas things where you
A	yeah
B	just had to
A	oh that was ridiculous wasn't it yeah?
B	not try and actually make any attempt to actually remember it
A	yes
B	but just supposedly you were meant to walk wake up in the morning
A	and it was there
B	and you just knew it
A	yes
B	you were just like a native
A	and do you remember that tape you had where the erm they said it they read something out in a normal voice and there was a whispering voice as well?
B	no I don't remember that
A	it's the it was another idea it sort of played the music and it
B	oh I remember Adele and Peter yes
A	and in Guadalajara in Mexico
B	I do remember it very well
A	and then you had a track where it just played the music and somebody was whispering in the background
B	yes I do I do remember it
A	the Spanish and that
B	yeah
A	I'm not sure
B	yeah well it certainly I their names have stuck in my mind I remember their names
B	what they said
A	mm
A	no
B	they were quite fond Peter was quite fond of Adele I remember
A	yes he he did quite fancy her didn't he?
B	yeah I think in in the end he
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	that's all he really cared about was
A	yes
B	getting off with Adele more than learning Spanish I feel
A	mm
B	although he probably had to do one to achieve the other
A	I think he already spoke Spanish
B	did he?
A	yes
B	he just pretended he didn't?
A	no no I think you're getting two things mixed up
A	you're getting the Michel Thomas CDs mixed up with the Peter and Adele story
B	yeah
A	mm
A	I've done some additional ones I took
B	you went to the erm institute didn't you in
A	yeah
B	I don't remember that
A	well you didn't go
B	where was it?
A	in in er
B	oh
A	but she was hopeless that teacher
B	okay
A	yeah
B	blame the teacher
A	well I do blame the teacher
B	it's no good is it? it's really no good
A	we we didn't ever speak in any Spanish and the teacher spoke English erm
B	you do
A	mm
B	and we do all know the optimum way to learn it is to learn it when you're young and you know you you you you
A	yeah but you can't be young if you're not young can you?
B	but I mean
A	mm
B	we've actually tried different methods of learning
A	mm
B	otherwise you just don't really have the
A	mm and
B	erm when we went to
A	mm
B	really feel slightly I was getting somewhere
A	yes
B	but I don't seem to have carried on with I mean that's totally my own fault
A	mm
B	but it just seems a bit unachievable to me so and the older I get I
A	mm mm
B	but do I actually having to be able to
A	mm I think we could
B	very basic things
A	mm yes I mean I do think we could get there and you start with the basics don't you? so you go into shops and order stuff and you you know can ask for a meal and you can even you know elaborate on what you do and don't want and complain and book hotel rooms
B	I can't get away from the fact that you sort of have an English phrase and you sort of translate it literally from the English words
A	mm
B	and and you know it might not really make any sense
A	well it won't will it?
B	you can't actually obviously don't know it it's
A	yeah
B	an obvious fact
A	yes mm
B	but the fact is you have to totally you know
A	mm mm
B	you have to learn a whole new way of
A	yeah
B	different
A	yeah
B	words you have
A	yes but it's but
B	no
A	do you? you just accept it so it's it's only an extension of that that you naturally need to let your brain develop these different patterns
B	I mean it's obvious that we've if we were really serious about it we've got to at least have a lot of
A	mm mm
B	whether you're answering them back or not that would be better obviously
A	yeah
B	but at least have you know the Spanish language playing in your ear to actually get used to the speed of it
A	I think so yeah
B	and and because you just hear I hear Spanish people speak now and you know sometimes unless you know you might be
A	no but
B	mm
A	you you might not understand what they're saying but erm you need to be able to recognise where the words are starting and ending and stuff like that which when you don't understand anything it's just a a stream of gibberish
B	no
A	but with Spanish we should be at least identifying occasional words
A	and getting used to the patterns of where they stop and start
B	no
A	I mean I think that does get better definitely
B	well it must do hopefully you know if you
A	mm
B	okay with the with
A	yeah it's very funny that isn't it? yeah yes
B	well it's really really odd
A	yeah
A	I've heard that so many times
B	yeah
A	since from other people about other languages yeah
B	but it's it's a saying it's a it's a truism isn't it?
A	yeah but it just shows you that your brain is able to sort of switch throw a switch between languages so it's got a
A	English language and then at the moment it's got everything else hasn't it? so
B	we shouldn't we can be the wrong switch though
A	yeah
B	no idea
A	I was talking to a girl a couple of weeks ago who speaks four or five different languages
B	I can't imagine how people can do that
A	well two of them she was she was raised with but with bilingual parents
B	does he?
A	oh yeah cos he's
B	what?
A	he's from
B	yeah I know that
A	his first language is
B	well why would he speak Castilian then?
A	well it's it's because Catalan is the minority language
B	mm
A	and Castilian is sort of like the official Spanish language
B	and yeah I mean I suppose it's
A	but he says that sometimes when he speaks to his mum on the phone erm he can't remember the word in
B	mm yeah yeah
A	you know but he can't remember the right word in in erm Catalan or Castilian but he can sometimes remember it in English you know? so that's a weird thing isn't it?
B	mm it is
A	mm mm
B	if they really are Catalan speakers I'm not sure they can all speak Castilian you know? but I suppose a lot of them can especially
A	yeah
B	the younger ones it they would
A	yeah
B	I don't mean
A	mm mm
B	I don't I don't think that
A	okay so let's take a an example nearer to home then if you go to Ireland
B	mm mm
A	erm the the you could probably find a
B	mm
A	but everybody else that lives there all the four million people or whatever who live in Ireland who speak Gaelic and not all of them do but the ones who do speak Gaelic also speak English
B	that's true but a lot of them only speak well as you say there's not many Gaelic speakers alone but there'll be a lot of people who don't have don't speak Gaelic at all
A	yeah but the but it's it's
B	mm
A	I dunno what the proportions are I don't know the numbers
B	yeah well it's it's only
A	they're all taught it
A	no but we're not saying
B	mm
A	so in the case of Catalonia
B	mm
A	Catalonians would also know Spanish
B	mm
A	you know
B	I would've still thought there would be fair number of people
A	well you'll have to google it cos I think you're wrong
B	yeah
A	erm
B	does it say?
A	they're
B	mm
A	but they are there are a lot of similarities
B	mm
A	and often he'll tell me a word he'll say this is erm
B	but the Basque language was really totally different
A	Basque is completely different
B	yeah
A	yeah they
B	I mean
A	well we
B	you know just look totally different a load of what was it? a load of Ks?
A	Ks and Xs and yeah
B	a load of Ks load of Xs yeah
A	yeah
B	and and er the place we stayed in started
A	mm
B	started
A	yeah
B	you know you just
A	which was place was that with a Z?
A	it didn't start with a Z did oh
B	yeah
A	yeah yes
B	started and ended
A	yeah
B	with a Z
A	yeah
B	mm mm
A	they they
B	think they say it was the
A	some somewhere
B	but
A	yeah
B	not
A	yeah
B	not not Mediterranean at all
A	no that would be worth having a look for actually
B	yeah
A	yeah
A	but no but I suppose we just have to keep on don't we really just? I mean look we
B	a song a week?
A	every week we'd have a a Spanish song and we'd have the lyrics and we'd practice and we didn't even do it once did we? and I type things into a I've got a program called Anki which is for erm vocabulary
B	I have no excuses at all
B	once every
A	well and now you're thinking that corn dollies might be quite a
B	I'm thinking of going into corn dolly work now actually
A	yeah
B	got a big batch arriving tomorrow
B	why am I er why
A	mm
B	and I'm not a particularly you know I like reading
A	yeah
B	actually think when I I I just bothers me somewhat about
A	mm
B	I know I know there's you know
A	oh absolutely yeah
B	I know that
A	mm
B	and we're not like this in everything we're quite good I'm quite good at
A	mm
B	every time I pick up the guitar or what have you it's like the first time I ever picked it up
A	yeah
B	you know I've seen some people try and learn gold and and and they're just utterly useless
B	and they play for a time and they might miss it less less often than they used to
A	mm mm
B	go anywhere
A	yeah
B	young ones
A	mm mm
B	always
A	yeah
B	pick it up to a degree
A	mm mm
B	ah dear just you you gonna you had a
[ANNOTATION]	Mostly older people try to learn how to play the guitar	Contradiction
A	no that's a program Anki
B	is that the one that
A	no that's something else
B	the the who a friend of his used to work on it or something
A	yes that's that's called Readlang which
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B plays only  the acoustic guitar.	Neutral
B	yeah
A	is a it's well actually it's quite good because
B	oh well yeah there's
A	yeah
B	quite a few of those I think some are better than others obviously
A	and the
B	okay yeah yeah
A	and so it it helps by recycling them so it's that is probably quite
B	mm
A	worth having a look at
B	mm mm
A	okay well we'll have a look at that this afternoon if you like
B	okay
A	yeah
B	okay
A	okay
B	yes
[ANNOTATION]	The two speakers do not have anything planned together for the afternoon.	Contradiction
