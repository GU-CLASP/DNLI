C	oh but they're such a friendly group this bell-ringers and I think what it is that we hand bell-ringing you've got to work as a team
A	yeah
C	and you can't if one drops out you've had it and so
A	yeah
C	you've got to and they all everyone
B	yeah
C	where are you going with them?
A	yeah
C	and cos it's all heavy stuff to be moved about
A	yeah
C	and yeah so I've that's that well worth going lots of ideas yeah and that's given me a bit more confidence in the in the
B	right
C	you see so we're doing that piece there but mind you we haven't got it we've done it twice now and haven't got it right twice
C	it's because it's not written it's written by
A	yeah
C	all line up I'm gonna ask
A	oh he's got everything
B	do you actually need to the it's not one you can just
C	it's handwritten well I could
B	yeah
C	write it better
B	can't you scan it in? not that type of thing?
C	erm no you have to it it's somebody's handwritten it they've written it especially for us
A	yeah
C	by hand
B	yeah
C	the notes are all drawn in and they're all
A	oh right
C	so difficult to read
B	not oh I see er yeah
C	so it needs to be put in a computer and then also but
A	yeah
C	and we've got three pages well we've got a page turn we may as well have four pages so one two one page turn three four and so all of the notes are bigger to look at
A	yeah
C	cos they're there
A	yeah
C	we we're we're doing that and the note they're out there
A	yeah I I'll ask
C	and it would help
C	you can get programmes
A	the oh right
C	I think I've got one but you've got to put it in on the midi the notes and then it will put it'll write it
A	oh I see yeah
C	so once you put the note in the computer then will write it
A	yeah
C	I don't really want to do that I just want just put must be some way of converting the keyboard into notes
A	yeah
C	mustn't there?
A	there must be yeah
C	erm that you press an A for a whatever you know
A	yeah
C	just there must be a way of doing that I think I
A	no you don't know well
C	I'll ask
A	if if you've got
C	if he can copy
A	you've got a
C	I think
A	you've got a a virus stopper ain't you on your computer?
C	yeah but I still don't like and I try and avoid it I'll well I've had so much trouble haven't I really

B	oh
C	but you only paid forty pound more so at twenty pound a night you paid
A	yeah
C	extra for sleeping there for the two nights which is
A	yeah
C	worth it really for
B	mm
A	did you get fed?
C	yeah
A	oh that's
C	they got breakfast lunch and dinner and the day ones we just got lunch and dinner
A	yeah
C	so we had lunch and dinner and then there was a bar they opened up last night
B	yeah
C	but I didn't stay for the barn dancing for obvious reasons
B	yeah
C	erm
C	the others did
B	you haven't been to one since have you?
C	no no
A	oh
C	oh no
A	you thought someone had
B	it's put you off
A	kicked you didn't you?
C	well I met this erm mm who was it?
B	really?
A	yeah
C	oh well it seemed to solve itself you know but er but we he was really angry and said he'd been kicked but it wasn't
B	yeah
C	there was no one behind him
A	no
C	so that must have been his
B	oh dear
A	yeah
B	it doesn't
C	mm
B	seem too vicious a dance does it? but I suppose
C	well
A	mm
C	we were doing this thing nine pin
B	you
C	as well that
A	oh right
C	yeah
B	when they do that basket thing and that
C	mm
B	it does spin round very fast doesn't it?
C	actually I should have told you about this cos no one would have you could have come in there were they had a a viewing gallery up one side of this gym this old army gym
B	oh
C	erm
B	mm
C	and you probably could have just driven in and and cos people were up the top watching it all and
A	yeah
C	it got to the final bit
B	yeah
C	it's really exciting when they all everybody plays
A	yeah
C	and some of the groups are fabulous others are not as good
A	so good
C	erm
B	mm
C	a lot of them they didn't announced that I've never that I haven't been playing for a year yet but others they said we've got three that have only just joined us and never been to one of these before they were all saying that
A	yeah?
C	whereas but I was
B	yeah
C	the very first
A	were you?
C	erm and erm
A	no warmups or anything?
C	no didn't play anything before which was a mistake
A	it was yeah
C	and just before we were late setting up getting our bells in there everyone was set up and we were rushing in with our bells
A	oh
C	and then
A	oh dear
C	so we ten minutes after we'd were supposed to have started we
A	yeah
B	oh
C	it was a bit of a rush
A	oh
B	mm
C	er I I I think it they were they were having more trouble up the top end than I was I did get back in and then they said oh you got back in and you finished and said well done
A	yeah?
C	erm but the girls they lost their place at the top and and they were struggling I could see it I you could see them frantically pointing
A	yeah
B	mm
C	erm they lost their place it's one of these things that sort of runs about all of the place
A	yes
C	but then the main tune zigzags in amongst it in the middle
A	yeah
C	main tune's in the middle and then if you those notes are done in red so you know if you've got one of them you've got to give it a bit of welly so the main tune comes out and then all the rest are tinkling around it
A	yeah
C	so it's it's it's it's complicated
A	yeah it sounds complicated
C	the
B	mm
C	seemed to me to be the best they had simple and slower tunes
A	mm
C	erm
A	wow
C	there was one girl who had three in each hand
A	yeah?
C	and the other two blokes had two in each hand so they had eight er four four
A	wow
C	ding ding ding ding and she I don't know how you do three in a hand
B	no I
C	and she
B	I don't know how you do
C	was playing six
B	two in a hand
C	and they were zooming about it was fantastic
B	oh
C	they were right next door to us doing it
A	oh
B	yeah
A	wow
C	amazing
B	unless they were chords that would be quite good wouldn't it? then you could do it couldn't you three in a hand?
C	well the trouble is it the they they only ring in one direction
A	yeah
C	so but and so you've got
B	oh yeah
C	two in hands you go forwards
B	oh
C	or backwards
B	gosh
C	or right
B	yeah
C	to left left
B	yeah
C	doesn't matter which er way you go
B	no
C	you've got three the other one you've got to have one at a triangle
B	yeah
C	one going off at an angle
A	yeah
C	in some direction
B	mm
C	which is even more difficult
A	it must be
C	but
B	mm uhu mm mm
C	I don't I don't I don't know how she was doing it
A	I've got
B	yeah
A	two left hands
C	but it is quite a common
A	so I'd never be any good
C	yeah and and the men they had really big bells two in a hand
A	yeah?
C	each hand
B	it's a lot of concentration isn't there?
C	mm
B	mm
C	but it's good it's good
B	mm
C	it's good to keep
B	mm
C	because it keep
B	it keep
C	your brain is really
B	it does keep your
C	yes
B	yeah
C	yeah it does yeah
B	yeah
A	you gotta keep your brain working at your age
B	yes it
C	I know
B	it's amazing
B	if you've got to concentrate on

B	yeah
C	yeah
A	well it
C	it was about
B	mm
A	which you thought you
C	three weeks ago I was driving through the village I couldn't stop though
B	mm
C	it was when those roadworks bits were there
A	yeah yeah
C	mm
A	lookalike then
C	mm
A	in actual fact we're seeing a lot of people that look very similar
B	yeah similar to her
A	from the back anyway
B	yeah
A	she's only what?
C	mm
A	five foot?
B	oh I know
C	mm
B	we were talking about phones and
A	oh yeah

A	May? well
C	and she let out I wish she
B	mm
C	hadn't let out we are the finale
A	oh are you?
C	the end of a a week of events and we are the finale
A	oh right you've gotta be the best
C	so there's not much pressure is there?
A	no you've just gotta be the best
B	mm
C	but there we are I mean but things like this make you work you're working hard together
B	yeah
C	and actually we had to play in a straight line which we don't normally do we're normally in a in a U shape so we can see each other
A	yeah yeah
C	that made it more difficult but I knew
B	yeah
C	something was up at the top end cos I kept seeing a finger pointing at
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	The final event is going to be hard.	Entailment
C	at
A	yeah?
C	yeah really good and she started by saying right okay now you weren't expecting this
A	wow
C	you see?
A	yeah
C	and before that she's given us a piece of paper
[ANNOTATION]	A female gave a piece of advice.	Contradiction
B	oh
C	I I wrote
A	did you?
C	challenge and somebody else did cos we had to go round and read it out and other people had put terrified petrified
C	couldn't do it you know and things like were being
A	oh
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	People were scared because something was embarrassing to do.	Neutral
A	yeah
C	written down
A	yeah
C	you know? and erm and things like that your your buttocks clenching
C	anyone?
B	right
C	there was she was she was really
C	you see
B	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker C has done a lot of glutes workout.	Neutral
C	you haven't got a sharp there instead of a flat or a natural why do you do it? you know you've if they were alright when they were on the table when you pick it up they're still right they can't have changed
A	no
B	yeah
C	so they're all things but she said how many of
B	yeah
C	there's nothing worse if you've got a second note and you're supposed to play a sharp and you play a natural
[ANNOTATION]	Playing something different than what the note say, it's really bad.	Entailment
A	oh
C	and er er erm there were all also little things things like that erm
B	mm
C	and so deep breaths
B	yeah
B	well the smiles do help a lot to relax you don't they? kind of
C	yeah
A	yeah
B	lighten it up
[ANNOTATION]	Person B think that smile could help to be relax	Entailment
C	but make sure it's not a
A	yeah
C	as if you've completely gone
B	mm
A	you looked like a village idiot then
C	yeah yeah pardon?
C	well that that's the way she did it she's lovely but
A	no
C	you can really you you can be confident because there's a hundred and twenty other bells or a hundred and fifty other bells going at the same time
A	yeah
C	not all at the same time but they're all
B	right
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Person A agrees that they must be in the same time	Neutral
C	and so you can
B	mm
C	you can really
A	yeah
C	it's brilliant it doesn't
A	no
B	yeah
C	so there's no there's no pressure whatsoever but it it's the feeling of being part of this wonderful sound
A	yeah
B	I bet someone recorded all that didn't they?
[ANNOTATION]	Person B think some one hundred percent did record it	Entailment
C	ah
A	no that's great yeah
B	yeah
C	whatsoever or or anywhere public they are for your own personal use and should must not be passed on to
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Person B think it is just for they personal use as Person C said	Neutral
C	anybody else and apart from that we are performing and you have no rights to take photographs and publish
B	yeah
C	us performing
A	that's true
C	the performing rights thing
B	yeah
C	erm and and they got we got well and I was playing away and this er erm and there's this bloke came along and
[ANNOTATION]	Person C  was followed by the guy was taken picture by him	Contradiction
A	yeah
C	you see?
B	yeah
C	so that I think which well I think it's fine for internal use for the organisation
A	yeah
C	that's fine it probably when they put stuff on the website
[ANNOTATION]	Person C think it was the same time as they upload things on the website	Entailment
A	yeah
C	erm they blur out all the faces but you will know who you are
A	yeah you could
C	from where you're standing
B	yeah
C	and which group you're in but they don't have any of the faces
B	that's
A	no
B	a shame really though isn't it?
C	well not really
B	isn't it really?
C	because you don't know who is looking for who do you? you know?
A	I had to do that with er
C	so
A	my childminder's site
C	yeah
B	mm
A	blur out
C	yeah
A	the children
C	yeah
B	it but you don't have to do it any more
A	no you don't have to do it any more no
C	no
B	it was just a thing that they had at the time
C	yeah
A	that's right you're supposed to get permission
C	and and
A	yeah
C	he
B	yeah
A	no
C	erm
B	yeah
C	so it
A	previous husband
C	well might there were two ladies who said I don't want to be videoed
A	yeah well yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	erm and and definitely not put anywhere so that was it then and
B	but if you're performers really I mean you're
A	hundreds of people
C	no that's a private event it's not it's not a public event
B	no I know that one was
C	oh but
B	but if
C	if we're doing it publicly you can't stop people being able to
B	in general
A	no you can't can you?
B	yeah
C	mm
C	yeah good point
B	when you are performing you're
C	yeah yeah
B	you are showing yourself in front of
C	mm
B	everyone aren't you?
C	mm
B	you know you're deliberately
C	yeah
A	well I mean if if if you go on television for instance I mean people video
C	mm
B	yeah
C	mm
A	through they record
C	mm
B	mm
C	oh I'll tell you the other thing that happened a couple of the groups did medieval music that they'd adapted
A	did they? oh right
C	no copyright on that if they if the person that wrote it is over seventy years gone
A	is it fifty?
B	yeah
A	I thought it was
C	it's
A	fifty
C	it's seventy
A	is it? oh
B	seventy
C	seventy years since they wrote it
A	yeah
C	they had a
A	had a had a copyright thing
C	did he? did he? yeah
A	and er I think he stopped somebody
C	mm but if you wanna put a copyright note on it you have to you have to log in print your stuff
A	yeah
C	er umpteen different places to make it work if you just put a C on the bottom and whatsit it's not worth anything
A	no no no
C	cos you've got to record it with all these
B	yeah
C	places but with music it's that but there then there are exceptions such that you can that that you can get a
A	yeah
C	the hall does the hall have a licence?
A	yeah
C	the hall the hall
B	mm
C	here does have a
A	they have a licence
B	they would have
A	to play music yeah
C	and and you pay so much per year and then that gets split between everybody
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	that's right erm
B	yeah
C	and the church has all got one as well
A	yeah
C	but and so for worship you can't
A	oh right
C	which is what I do when I'm down I play music when I'm down there
A	depending on what sort of music it isn't it?
C	mm?
A	er it's er as long
C	well it was worship it was worship music
A	you can play music
A	right
B	mm
A	as long as people don't pay for it
C	yeah
A	take any money
B	do you?
C	I think you're just not allowed to play it if er
A	no you can play anything you can play music
C	so you could invite people in and
B	oh
C	just put a contribution towards the tower
B	oh I see
C	er if you don't charge them?
B	if any old music you
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	there was er
B	that's true
C	but if you
A	I mean
C	can't do it in a in a public place can you? you see? it's where you do it
A	well there was case
B	if it's for your own use
A	a case about this er like like
B	oh
A	down the road there that weren't him that was another garage
C	uhu
A	right? and they had Radio One or two on or three or four or whatever it was and they were fined
B	yes
C	mm
B	strange isn't it?
A	which is
B	that one's strange
C	mm
A	which is you know natural
B	I think
C	mm
A	people listen to
C	yeah going all the time
A	and
C	what about music while you work?
A	yeah
B	but aren't they disbanding that stupid
A	I think they
B	erm I think they
A	must have done yeah
B	cos
A	cos they did they did
B	how do they
C	but you can see why you you'd protect somebody's work
A	yeah
C	and that's what they're doing so you can't mass produce it and or put your name on it
A	oh yeah
C	and change it a little bit you're not allowed to do that even
A	no
C	er
A	no they call it
C	but when it come
C	yeah but isn't it daft you know that some drummer did some rhythm years ago you that's been on the news recently
A	yes
C	and and he's now having a go at other groups that use that rhythm well when you're thumping a drum you can thump whatever rhythm you like
A	of course you can yeah
C	how can you
B	mm
C	put a copyright on a certain riff or whatever
A	yeah
C	they call it
A	a riff that's what they call it
C	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	well why can you? but cos anybody can bang a drum like that
A	yeah
B	mm
C	they don't need to have heard yours to have done it
A	no
C	you can come up with your own one
A	yeah
C	no it's it's weird
B	mm
C	isn't it?
A	yeah that called a riff it's
C	and again you see there are only certain ways you can put music together
A	yeah
C	mm
A	I think I think er when you think about music
C	mm
A	and for how long music has been written and played and what have you
C	mm
A	there are millions and millions of different
C	it must all have been done before or similar
B	yeah
C	it's
B	but then little tiny sections isn't it
C	mm mm
B	and then something's
A	I mean
B	is different
C	mm
A	yeah I mean
B	yeah
A	that there are some songs or or
C	mm
A	music that remind you of another
C	oh
A	song
B	I mean you can sometimes say
C	yeah yeah
B	that sounds like
C	yeah yes
A	yeah
C	yeah you know you've say the start
B	but then it's not
C	of a Beatles one somebody else picked up on it didn't they and then
A	they did yeah
C	then they thought well have a
A	well they they played Beethoven didn't they The Beatles? did er no

A	no
A	oh dear
A	oh
C	oh that's a good one for the French national anthem isn't it?
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	yeah I got a reminder of that because they ran it they they ran out of paper they ran out they didn't
A	yeah
C	terms the soap bits hadn't been filled up
A	oh they used to play something like that in the pub years ago when I quite young that was er
C	mm

C	oh they got locked in
C	from Monday to Saturday
B	oh yeah
C	nobody knew they were there that's it yeah
B	yeah

A	no er
C	there's no founder though it was just all just all people that go to the church
A	just just people that go yeah
C	otherwise you wouldn't know about it

C	who you you know rather you know rather than throwing it away
A	yeah well that that lovely dandelion you took up?
C	no no no no not something like
A	you just sort of
C	it was a good one
B	oh it was lovely
C	was it a good one?
A	such a beautiful
B	yeah I put it in a pot ready to er
C	mm
A	and and
B	and plant again
A	it was it was it was like that
C	say it was like
A	yeah
C	so they that's that's happening in about a month's time that's the next thing
B	yeah
C	and you see
A	yeah
C	into for ringing it's ever so easy we just walked in and did it and said now I've put in front of you we've got some music here's some something funny he said we've got funny letters up above each each bar he said yes that's what I want you to play in each bar so if you're stood in front of those two any of those bells
A	yeah
C	ring it when it says if you cos if it says A ring you've got a A you ring it and we went through ringing it at the start of the bars then doing it two in a bar and then
A	yeah
C	then you get to now the they really test you erm turn your piece of paper over there's a hymn
A	oh
C	you see and I want you to sing as well
A	oh crikey what and
C	and we managed it
B	oh right
C	we managed it
A	it
B	yeah?
C	it's you wouldn't have put your name down for church rhythmic playing if you if you
A	no
C	you see?
B	yeah
C	and we managed it and it was lovely and then erm
A	yeah?
C	and then then the ones at the back started adding in the tune but they were started really quiet and it got louder and louder then they started singing with it till they got to the place and then
A	wow
C	it was a fabulous start
B	mm
C	erm and then they played another piece at the end as well and that was that's what they'd done the day before
A	yeah
C	they'd had one and a half hours on church music
A	wow
B	yeah
C	it's a brilliant brilliant two days I wish I I would have liked that one
C	shown I I know why I didn't put my name down cos I wasn't quite sure what
A	yeah
C	they had quinoa or something? is that some
A	quinoa yeah
B	yeah
C	is that this sort of stuff
B	no oh erm
C	they'd had that cos we had a Japanese lady there or
B	no quinoa is that
A	quinoa is was
C	well it was
B	that's those seeds
C	it's something er
B	no
C	something like quen quenoy quinoy or something?
A	yeah
B	t'ai chi?
C	I think it's this no it was it sounded like
A	I know that
C	something like that
A	they do it in parks and that
C	yeah they were doing that in the gym
B	yeah
C	erm but
A	mm
B	these four things but erm
A	yeah?
C	one and a half hours and you you categorise those one to seven of
A	oh I see yeah
C	your order of preference
A	yeah
C	I didn't get any of my ones
C	I wanted to do a beginners two in hand
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	or four in hand as they call it I would have liked that
B	yeah
C	but then I was really pleased when I got this rhythmic ringing which I didn't know
B	yeah
C	what it was and it was lovely
B	mm
C	he's a super bloke is our
A	yeah brilliant
B	oh yeah
C	but they they were they they I'd got it's got to be a bell thing because to ring bells you've gotta be frightfully organised really to get the stuff there and make it work and pack pack them
A	yeah
B	mm
C	and
A	did they have to be tuned up every now and then?
C	no you you can't polish them
A	no that's right yeah
C	that's why we wear the gloves
A	yeah
C	because if you start polishing them you change the tune if you
A	yeah
C	if you if you ware it away at all
A	yeah
B	oh right
C	if some of the bell sets are horrid because cos they've they got old bells mixed in with new bells and they don't ring the same
A	no they wouldn't ring the same
C	ours are all ours are all one were a complete set from Whitechapel
A	yeah
C	years ago and some of them have got new handles on but the bells are
B	right
C	the same nice deep round sound
A	yeah
C	but the more modern ones sort of
B	oh
A	they're quite tinny
C	they're tinny yeah they're tinny
A	yeah
C	and if you've got some of the bells when they're ringing it's like oh that's not good it's cos some of them weren't if an A lower A is not the same as a higher A you know?
A	no
C	because they were two sets of bells that they've
A	yeah
C	they've they've put together and are not quite the same
A	mm
C	but it it was fascinating it was I really enjoyed that
B	yeah
A	no that's good
C	something totally different
B	mm
C	I had my doubts a few years ago what? oh I know I didn't finish what I was saying you know I was saying about how you can
A	mm
C	I was going into about church and you can write these chords out?
A	oh that's nice
C	you know so just just on a permanent loan
A	yeah
C	erm
B	oh
C	and then that's where I was going to link from the youth team
A	yeah
C	with the music
A	yeah
B	mm
C	and you've got got to read if I've got a B bell and I'm playing that B bell when it says B above that
A	yeah
C	you see?
A	yeah
C	erm or you could do it by colours you could colour bells
A	yeah
C	there probably are coloured ones actually so red there probably er are all different colours
B	they've got coloured bells actually yeah
C	then you just put the coloured bit of pencil
B	you know the bell
C	above where they play
B	that you know
C	erm but
B	mm
A	that was a xylophone
C	I can add them in
B	yeah
C	add them in to when the worship band's playing they could be doing guitar type chords on the on the bells as well
A	yeah
C	interesting isn't it?
A	yeah anyway
C	yes anyway yes
A	you give me me
C	mm?
A	we got your erm shelving units out there you know that you left up
C	yeah
B	you used to have all for the plants and things
A	where you had the plants and what have you standing on?
B	oh well I'll show you in a minute when we go out
A	er
B	or when you go
A	we didn't want them any more
C	right
A	but we wondered if you you'd like them or we'll we'll get the scrap man to come and fit pick them up
C	are they are they metal with wheels?
A	yeah
B	mm
C	how many are
A	yes
C	how many are there?
A	two
B	two
C	well
A	and then there's just a a metal one
B	and then there's another metal thing that er was ours er smaller shelving
A	yeah
B	that might be useful in your garage but you don't you don't listens to answerphone do you?
C	well I'm often not there to get the answer
B	yeah
C	oh I see but I don't
B	well
C	no I'm not good at listening to my answerphone
B	but you should
C	no
B	you should because I I

C	mm
B	mm
A	I bet she wish
C	so
A	she'd never given him rotavator
B	yeah
C	well I wonder why she did I mean it was daft cos well why did
B	crazy idea
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	at that age it's it's it's not there's no
B	you don't need an allotment at that age either do you?
C	well just turning it over quietly with a fork
A	yeah yeah
C	that's fine
B	yeah
C	just a little bit at a time that's what that's what he did
B	yeah
C	and he enjoyed being on his plot
B	yeah
C	erm and he always had two
A	yeah
B	mm
C	erm so it it was sad
A	well that was and he had his plot in his garden weren't it?
C	well
A	yeah
C	but
A	oh right
C	he was in
A	yeah
C	they both had the same plot in
A	oh right yeah
C	well
A	yeah
C	was
B	yeah
C	erm
A	yeah
C	and and then I shot back erm I came back and I did some work I was busy on the Thursday Thursday night was bell practice again
A	are you going to the big party in
C	what's that?
C	oh now how are we gonna work this?
B	we haven't had a technical problem we have to go this time
A	I know we do
B	oh oh I just thought
C	the he had erm Toby can't because Toby upset the cats he can't go in the kitchen now he knows he can't go in the kitchen and he stays in the hall even when you open the door now he doesn't go in the
A	oh right
C	kitchen
A	yeah
C	but so he can and the cats seem to know when he's there and they stay out
A	yeah
C	so Toby has all the rest of the house but not the kitchen
A	yeah
C	but if there's people coming and going all over the place and it's a hot day
B	yeah
C	erm
A	yeah
C	then he came in at night when everyone had gone
A	yeah
C	erm but if it turns out to be a hot day he can't stay in the car
A	yeah
C	and cloudy
A	yeah
C	last time
A	yeah
C	erm so I need to
B	yeah
A	we've gotta
B	what?
B	yeah we'll have to take the car I think because
C	so they're coming down okay
B	mm
C	well
A	yeah
C	erm I don't know how what to or what I'm gonna do cos the the I think they don't want to lose the cat again they lost their cat for about a year before they got it back
C	what happened was erm normally the cats
B	oh that's right yeah
A	that's right yeah
C	you see they live outside up on top of things so Toby can't get well on this one occasion I said to
B	oh
C	and the back door was open so Toby goes straight in straight out the back door chases them down to the bottom of the garden
B	oh
C	you see
A	yeah
B	and then the male cat never came back
A	oh
B	mm
C	and found a home over the road but they didn't know that and about a year later they find out that the cat is living opposite cos they
B	yeah
C	they kept seeing it but they didn't know where it was going and it wouldn't come back
C	and being fed by the people over there so so they this is roughly what happened so
A	yeah
C	erm and found out that it belonged over the road so now
B	yeah
C	they've got it back
B	oh
C	but she doesn't wanna lose it again
B	yeah yeah
C	erm which is fair enough they're
A	yeah
C	erm if it's gonna be mouldy weather then Toby can come and stay in the car and he'll come in at night when everything's shut up but with people opening all over the place
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	you can't expect him to stay in a hall
A	no
C	it won't work
A	no
C	if the whole house is being used
B	no
C	so if it's a sunny day I can't take him
B	yeah
C	erm
B	will
B	mm?
C	don't think she can cope with the three
B	oh of course
C	cos she works at weekends so
B	no I meant
B	but she can't because of her dog can she?
A	she
C	no she can't
B	no
C	no no
B	no
C	but in fact her having between us three dogs does restrict us to what we can do
B	it does
C	and it's tricky cos she works every weekend
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	they won't even say if she can have time off or
C	cos they can't look that far ahead
B	that's terrible
C	it's chaotic this care
B	yeah
C	care service you know there
A	that's terrible
C	mm
B	mm
A	I mean if she
C	she's she's getting better though
A	if she was
C	she's getting stronger
A	a bit stronger
B	yeah
A	a lot stronger then she
B	I can't
A	she could say no I can't
B	do this weekend
A	I have
C	mm mm
A	I have an appointment
B	or get
A	I have my family
C	well she knows she
B	got enough notice
C	she needs a job for another six years
B	yeah but if she gives notice er
C	mm
B	I can't do the weekend
C	no
A	at so and so and so and so
B	erm August say
A	mm

C	we'd we'd missed there was something else
B	yeah
C	completely different was on and we just cos she was tired I was tired
B	mm

A	yeah?
C	the same family
B	yeah
C	they've got several homes there's one on the coast there's one here there's one somewhere else
B	mm
C	they're taking advantage of what
A	yeah
C	she can do
A	yeah
C	not many people can do the drugs and she has to do all that
B	yeah
C	as well as
B	and then you feel responsible cos you know the people
C	yeah so it's difficult
C	yeah
B	ah mm
A	does she have er lay them out and do when they
B	oh yeah
A	yeah
C	yeah yeah it's things like that so oh we lost another one today
A	yeah
C	and then what's worse is when they get one that's er dies and they weren't expecting it then they have to call the police the doctor forensic they all come in
B	mm
C	and then so you feel guilty
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	they're all coming round and checking and there's nothing they've just they've just
A	yeah
C	gone when they weren't expected to
B	right
C	but to her that's but the other what what then upsets her is she's not allowed to go some of them she has a she usually has a special lady
A	yeah
C	someone that she feels that she needs to give a bit more attention to
A	yeah
C	and there's a little bond forms and she gets really upset when they go but she's not allowed to go to the

B	we might well
C	well it's so obvious
B	get in touch with them as well
A	yeah

B	mm
[ANNOTATION]	speaker c thinks it's pretty obvious	Entailment

A	swing it round
B	it's it belong the the field is
A	yeah
B	he came round and he had coffee and that
C	mm
B	erm but I think the other one's even more angry isn't he?
A	yeah
B	it is
C	who has pigs?
B	the farm
C	the farmers
B	the farm
C	they have got pigs up there?
B	they've got pigs down the not not on the field

A	yeah
B	mm especially at the gate
