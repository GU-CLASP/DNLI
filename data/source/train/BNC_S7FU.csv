B	what about
A	well I was just wondering if anybody actually managed to meet him for lunch
B	I dunno
A	cos when we went down there
B	yeah
A	he said have you seen
B	oh
A	I was like well no we were looking for him when yeah and that was four o'clock and
B	yeah I felt a bit bad that he turned up with
A	what?
B	and we hadn't kind of er cos I said we'd arrange to show them
A	oh it doesn't matter I'd only I've never met
B	was that the first time you met her?
A	well I think I kind of half said hello
B	oh really? I didn't introduce you?
A	no no
B	oh shit sorry
A	no it's alright I knew I kind of figured out who she was after a while well cos she stood with
B	oh gosh I didn't realize you hadn't met her
A	erm but erm I think she I think she was at that staff do erm
B	yeah
A	a little er but
B	yeah she
A	and I kind of said hello but she looked very different today
B	mm
A	erm but I just kind of said hello in passing at the
B	right
A	and that was it so yeah
B	ah
A	it pretty much was the
B	oh jesus I didn't realize
A	yeah so you know why why would we invite round why would I invite round people who I don't know
B	no I think it was up to me cos
A	yeah when cos you're saying hello to these girls
B	oh
B	sorry the girl in the white was the owner of the bar
A	yeah I realised cos she showed me around later
B	yeah
A	after
B	and the other one was
A	she showed me that place upstairs
B	yeah the other one was
A	yeah I didn't yeah cos I er I didn't I thought it changed ownership that place
B	mm
A	erm I thought the person who was owned it before summer a different person owned it now but
B	no but I was I was asking her what do you wanna do with the space upstairs?
A	when? oh what? today? yeah
B	she showed me upstairs as well and you know it's alright up there but it's not
A	oh I think it's alright I think it's a nice space
B	she said she was gonna cut if off build a wall
A	yeah because
B	and she her idea was to have like an open music thing where people can just go in and play music
A	mm
B	and she'd put some instruments up there
A	okay that's dangerous though
B	yeah which just sounds she was talking about guitars and stuff I was like well no guitars need to be people need to bring their own guitars you can't just pick up a guitar  cos it will just get fucked
A	yeah no point in her buying
B	you can't have a communal guitar it'll just get ruined
A	you'd have people
B	if people are serious about learning guitar they can bring their own guitar and play it yeah?
A	yeah
B	and it's the same with any instrument really I said well yeah
A	well mind you what would you do without the?
B	I said maybe you can get maybe you can get a piano in there if she wants to pay for a piano but
A	well what would you do without the cajón at
B	well I'd use my cajón
A	but you didn't have one at the beginning you never played a cajón before
B	no
A	well you wouldn't know how like
B	yeah
A	so
B	no no it's a brilliant idea but I don't know how it would work especially in the Chinese market in that area
A	they yeah they do have a lot of Chinese customers don't they?
B	but do they wanna go and play music? I don't think so
A	no I think she's better off saying come and listen to a band
B	well that's what I was trying to say I was saying look we can play we're open to playing places but I don't think she wants to pay money for it
A	ah I see yeah
B	she wants to attract people by having music but not paying for a band
A	yeah open mic nights
B	but I said open mic night and she said no not really just any time morning afternoon evening anyone can go in and just jam and just play and pick up an instrument and play
A	well that's nice cos it's a practice place
B	which is a lovely idea yeah that's what it was as a practice place
A	no and I was thinking
B	exactly what she wants to do
A	she said she said she doesn't want the sound to go to disrupt downstairs
B	mm
A	because she's got singers coming in downstairs
B	yeah that's where they're playing the music
A	I was thinking
B	yeah no cos they pay these Filipino guys to come in and play during the evening
A	yeah
B	downstairs
A	I think I've put too much garlic in this look look at all that garlic
B	it's okay
A	I've suddenly got tired after all that day how can a lunch last until dinner time?
B	dunno
A	and I'm starving
B	yeah so
A	oh why?
B	early start tomorrow taking the kids for a trip to the country

B	who else can I phone?

A	mm
B	you're not like the other wives
B	are you?
A	er why? why?
B	mm?
A	why not?
B	why?
A	yeah
B	I can't say on the recording
B	erm
A	ah
B	well I'm glad you took that as a compliment
A	oh was it not gonna be?
A	oh
B	no and I bet a lot of wives wouldn't have taken that as a compliment what do you mean not like other wives?
B	no it was a compliment
B	whee
A	is that enough?
A	do you want more?
B	erm no
A	just to yeah?
[ANNOTATION]	There is a statement that is not considered a good compliment for wives.	Entailment
B	yeah
A	okay plates what do you wanna do
B	well yeah we can
A	shall we sit at the table?
B	we can talk as well
A	we can I suppose so
B	don't just have to sit and eat
B	could do
A	but
B	well
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B want to talk during the meal.	Entailment
A	no no no just generally I'm thinking now
B	I don't wanna see your food really
A	like
B	mm
A	cos when I've got food in front of me I'm just interested in the food and
B	mm
A	I I only half hear what people are talking to me about
B	yeah
B	well
A	sometimes I'm alright
[ANNOTATION]	When speaker A focuses on food, he/she has difficulties in paying attention to other things.	Entailment
B	mm
B	yeah
A	so I just so I just
A	is that not normal?
B	well
A	no cos
B	I think that's cos you were starved as a kid
A	yeah well I think so too
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A was a very poor kid.	Neutral
B	you're kind of like you're erm bit like a dog
A	yeah
B	you have to kind of wolf it down and if anyone fetches your bowl you just kind of
A	yeah especially if there's a favourite dish of mine on the table
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	It's easy for speaker A to share food.	Contradiction
B	do you think do you think that's true?
A	I don't think I was starved as a kid
B	not starved but neglected
A	I wasn't neglected I wasn't neglected at all
A	we er we didn't have much money so we didn't have as much food as some people
B	yeah
A	no I can't even remember
B	oh this person's gonna have to listen to us eating pasta that's gonna be nice
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A used to eat a lot of truffle when was young.	Contradiction
A	mm that's not very pretty is it? where are we sitting? here at the table?
B	yeah
A	there's too many bananas on this table there
B	are you just gonna? shall I throw that away?
A	yeah I'm not gonna eat it I can't believe the lady in the shop gave her a lollipop I was like erm
B	who gives a six month old baby a lollipop?
A	she's six months old and then I can't remember the word for toy but then she said oh she can have it as a toy
B	mm
A	and there's
A	and she didn't know what to do with it
A	but she appreciated it
A	and then I secretly stole it off her basically when we left the shop
A	and she didn't even try to put it in her mouth
B	mm
A	which was good
B	mm
A	she's got used to this kind of if you look er I think it's because this is the same shape as the erm drumsticks
B	oh yeah okay did she try and hit the table with it?
A	well she was just holding it waving her cos I was holding her
B	mm
A	so she wasn't near a table
B	maybe doesn't
A	well she puts everything else in her mouth
B	yeah
A	and she's not allowed to put the drumsticks in her mouth
B	yeah
A	and this with the little bobble on it
B	mm
A	it looks like well are they called drumsticks? or xylophone sticks? or? what are they called?
B	erm yeah I dunno
A	with the big round circles
B	mm
A	so she just held it like this
B	mm
A	yeah maybe I dunno but she puts everything else in her mouth so I would
B	well she puts the
A	haven't got any other
B	drumsticks in her mouth as well
A	well no but she gets told off about that
B	mm mm
A	well not told off but discouraged
B	yes not told off we don't abuse our daughter we just have to tell everyone this
A	why did you have to
B	I'm just no er what I meant was it's funny cos when you're recording you you kind of adapt you run everything you're gonna say through a filter you wouldn't have said that in normal conversation
A	said what?
B	what did you say?
A	we tell her off?
B	erm I can't remember what you said
A	tell her off if she tries to eat the the drumsticks
B	mm yeah you said we don't
A	oh then I said well not tell her off
B	yeah yeah
A	mm
B	you were checking yourself not for me you were checking yourself for whoever was listening to us
A	no I'm forgetting that that's on aren't I?
B	no you weren't you wouldn't have said that
A	no?
B	if if that wasn't there
A	well that's that's a shame I'd like to just completely forget
B	but does that er does that actually have an impact on the er on the corpus?
A	well
B	it doesn't really cos we're just speaking English right? I mean that's the
A	it doesn't for the small collocations
B	no no and that's what it's all about really
A	that's what it's for
B	it's not really looking at erm speaker turns really and and things like that as far as I can tell
A	and additonal comments to
B	no
A	clarify the meaning
B	no
A	it's not about that
B	no no no no just collocations which is what
A	they you could never analyse speech for meaning when people know that they're being recorded
B	no you
A	mm?
B	you need to video them as well you can't do such a massive study
A	but you can't anyway because like you said you do er adapt things
B	mm
A	you can't help it
B	mm
A	you can try and forget all you like but I think I think you speak naturally most of the time
B	yeah
A	you speak naturally but yeah maybe there's it's just a little part of your brain that
B	it's like a little switch in your brain I suppose I suppose you've got switches for everything though every situation you're in
A	yeah I used to have a swearing switch
B	you've got a switch yeah you've got a switch for when you're with your parents
A	yeah
B	that you er you monitor the language that you use
A	or er not just the
B	you've got a
A	oh yeah all language
B	you've got a switch at work
A	and and the topic content
B	mm yeah you know you've got a switch for your mates
A	what's happened to your switch lately?
B	my switch is broken
A	yeah it's
A	it seems a bit broken lately
A	when you walked across the street and got angry at that driver
B	well yeah I I it's not normally I
A	no it's not normal for you
B	I shout you fucking cunt
A	no no it's not normal
B	no no but
A	mm
B	and that person
B	drove up went in front of us
A	and
B	and beeped his horn
A	and she was asleep yeah mm
B	when she was asleep as well sorry but I think that was quite er
A	yeah but if she's any older then you need a switch and you have to say
B	well
A	oh what a naughty man don't you?
B	I dunno
A	or does she have to or should she learn swearing's part of language?
B	I think what I did was actually quite mild from what I could've done
A	I don't think cunt is a mild word
B	no
A	like it's the worst word you can say
B	but I could've gone over there and thumped his bonnet
A	thumped his bonnet
A	smashed his headlights in?
A	picked up a baseball bat?
A	mm
B	what what kinda head space would you do it?
A	yeah but that happens a lot here so
B	yeah but
A	so you need to adapt to have a different threshold
B	I know it happens a lot but I don't care what culture you're from when the light is green for a pedestrian and there's other people walking across you don't
A	he
B	was he?
A	yeah
B	oh I didn't know that
A	he was on his phone so he must've actually been on his phone with one hand and beeping the horn with the other
A	he must've taken his hand off the wheel
B	I
A	to beep the horn otherwise how can you do that? you can't can you? no he was definitely
B	well that makes it even worse
A	yes it does yes it does because he took his hands off the wheel so his
B	so who are you
A	car could've gone anywhere
B	who are you trying to defend here?
A	nobody I'm not trying to no no no I think you did the right
B	well no because he wouldn't have
A	in a year's time
B	understood what that meant I need to learn how to say it in Chinese
B	mm
A	but because swearing is part of language I don't think actually you should shield kids from that completely
B	I think
A	but I think
B	used in the correct situation
A	yeah and that
B	I don't see what the problem is in that
A	mm
B	you don't put my kid at risk
A	mm
B	driving on the bloody phone when it's a green light for the pedestrian
A	yeah
B	driving right up to us beeping their horn when she's er sleeping what the hell?
A	yeah it was quite obvious that she was asleep
B	yeah
A	why's that curtain moving? is the window open?
B	and it wasn't just us it was
A	yeah door was open
B	I mean
A	mm better check all of them actually
B	this is the thing I don't like about China you know?
A	oh no
B	E tags
A	hang on
B	speaker one has left the room are you coming back?
A	all the bathroom no no no all the bathroom windows were open
B	mm
A	mosquitoes were all coming in
B	yeah
A	everything with the lights on sorry I just had to close them all like
B	mm
A	at night
B	mm
A	I bet there's hundreds I bet we've got hundreds can't see any in here
B	although well you know at the risk of sounding racist the Chinese don't have much manners
A	not all
B	civilised
A	you can't say
B	no well no I'm talking
A	yeah but
B	but there's
A	some are very nice polite
B	yeah of course they are
A	mm
B	no but it's true
B	the civilised part of the society is
A	mm
B	there's just something lacking which is weird because you'd think for a supposed like socialist country where they're
A	mm
B	they'd have this kind of cohesiveness but they don't
A	mm
B	as far as what I can see
A	well I see it as half and half anyway because look how they rallied round with our key today
B	yeah yeah yeah well yeah yeah
A	and that security guard
B	mm
A	erm tut came in and opened the door for us and he wasn't even coming in
B	mm
A	with his keycard and he was trying his hardest
B	mm
A	and we thought he was trying to get it in
B	mm
A	but actually no he'd
B	mm
A	well he walked off again
B	mm
A	so
B	well there must be a certain type
A	I know there's a lot
B	of manners I dunno or I mean cos the British are renowned for their manners right?
A	mm
B	I mean we're we push it too far
A	yeah far too far
B	we're we're too polite
A	far too many
B	we someone walks into us we apologise to them
A	yeah
B	it's stupid what we do
A	well
B	but
A	a lot a lot of the Chinese told me to stop saying thank you so much
B	mm
A	no more thank yous
A	I say it like every second sentence
B	mm yeah
A	you order a cup of coffee in a shop
B	mm
A	in a café
B	cos we we think that's a way of showing of respect
A	and you say thank you and they'd say mm it's my job
B	yeah
A	why would you say thank you to me?
B	yeah
A	I'm not doing you a favour I'm doing my job
B	yeah
A	mm yeah we're extreme and it's actually quite annoying
B	it is annoying
A	mm far too annoying
B	it's er it's just I don't know how I think we must've colonised the world by being like super polite
B	maybe people just lower their defences a bit and then
A	yeah
B	and then we just build some railway lines and er
A	mm
A	mm
B	I mean how did we colonise the world by being so polite?
A	mm well we had guns
B	excuse me do you do you mind if I? oh sorry I've eaten that pasta a bit quick
B	would you mind if I stick a flag here and call it?
A	that's Izzyard er
B	that's it's easy for you to say
A	mm
B	do you know what? I'm gonna have another beer and I'm gonna phone
A	mm but you said you'd be there in an hour didn't you?
B	yeah
A	well what time is it now?
B	tut erm
A	er go on you gotta finish your joke
B	well
A	you gotta do your joke but without a flag
B	what joke?
A	you got to continue the colonisation thing but not with a flag with something else
B	erm I can't remember what I was saying what was I saying?
A	how did we how did we colonise so many countries
B	by being
A	by being polite?
B	polite that's that is a good joke isn't it?
A	mm but
B	shame I can't think of some punchline
A	Eddie Izzard Eddie Izzard goes oh excuse me don't he?
B	yeah oh I suppose it has been done hasn't it?
A	you know you said that we had some food? could we have some food?
B	erm mm
A	you can no you can you can do your twist on it
B	was slightly different wasn't it?
A	there's something there
B	yeah
A	it's in your in your eyes I can see it's there
A	ready to come out
B	erm
A	it's like a word that you can think of but you can't say it

A	what? that I know there's a little hamster in your head
B	mm
A	no
B	how did you know he was there?

A	that will annoy me all night
B	well you'd better look it up then
A	mm
B	the fictitious
A	what word was I thinking?
B	well they're both adjectives
A	well it's like inspiring and inspirational inspiring to do with somebody is being inspired by somebody
B	is it to do with the agent?
A	yeah
B	so fictitious fictional fictitious book the fictional
A	character
B	character
A	but you just used fictitious er for the character of your hamster
B	my hamster's not fictitious
A	yeah but just cos you're

A	we're on citron day tomorrow oh
B	ironically calling him a wuss which again
