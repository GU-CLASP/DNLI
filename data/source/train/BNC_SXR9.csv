[ANNOTATION]	The man Speaker B talks to is 40 years old.	Contradiction

A	you have the rest of the
A	like
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B is texting a man.	Entailment
B	no no
C	you know I was watching think I was watching I think it was the big questions or free speech it was one of those
A	mm mm?
C	and it was just it was like the cutest thing I've ever seen in my life it was
B	was he Asian or white?
A	yeah there are so many
C	yeah he's Pakistani
B	oh I think I've heard of erm
C	yeah and then they were there's a debate a debate show and he was saying his question was erm
B	do you feel like religions need to accept people if they're gay and stuff?
A	yes
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A is a liberal.	Neutral
C	erm
A	should read an open letter
C	I feel like they should
[ANNOTATION]	The guy speaker C talks about is trans.	Neutral
C	okay fair enough right if if you don't agree with it
B	yeah
C	but I don't think you should act based on that opinion of yours
A	yeah
C	I think you should just leave that opinion to the back of your head
B	yeah?
C	and I think you should treat them exactly the same
B	yeah
B	but I don't think people need to
C	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B is a supporter of LGBTQ rights.	Entailment
B	that's
C	to try and get marriage illegal
A	yeah
C	religious and non religious people spend big money to do things like that
A	I dunno
B	oh Reza Aslan
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker C dates Pakistani men exclusively.	Neutral
A	yeah I love that
C	what do you think about that?
B	erm
A	what do you think about it
B	as a father
C	okay erm
unknown_female	mm mm mm
C	I think it just becomes difficult I think
A	why would they would be religious?
C	I think
A	okay
B	why who would be religious?
C	someone who's gay
B	erm well the thing is there are
A	every religion is an interpretation of of
B	which could accept it
A	scripture
A	or misogyny
B	and then
A	or killing nature
B	they said okay no we we no that was wrong cos look at these Bible quotes that say it's wrong that they did that
A	yeah
B	so
A	so just
B	well why are they perfect?
A	think that's
B	the thing is that you can't say that Islam for Islam
C	yeah
A	I know that's what the
B	Quran is the perfect
A	I know
B	there are multiple interpretations but
A	and
B	but
A	yeah
A	I just think it's
C	I think it I just think it becomes too complicated
A	mm
C	I think you have to begin to
A	in what way?
B	like you can't even connect to it
A	right
B	just a
A	I think they always try and highlight
B	the thing is it it sounds weird because they don't encourage any like individual thought they encourage repetition of what people said like
A	yeah
B	they don't encourage you to
A	right
B	this is why it's just so boring
B	it's so boring
A	does the process involve you thinking for yourself anyway though?
B	no it's
A	right yeah
B	there is erm a book about Muslims er Young British and Muslim
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	it's got some
A	good ten minute read?
