B	ah probably
A	I mean it does come with it
C	it comes with a drink anyway
A	it comes with it seems a bit silly not to get it doesn't it?
D	I might have the rogan josh actually cos we don't often have a lamb one do we?
B	I like it I'm tempted by the chicken tikka masala
[ANNOTATION]	Person B think that chicken with tikka masala is tempting	Neutral
C	I'll have a chicken tikka masala
D	well that's what you have normally off of that menu when that's what they do any er

D	when we went to Bruges the satnav the last roundabout you come to the satnav turns you right
B	yeah
D	so which was wrong and we went down and it wasn't there and then this little man come
A	he took you?
D	so off he goes on his little bike his little old legs going
C	road no no no he goes back back back and away
D	and then he
B	is it just cos he was little? was he was he a midget?
D	no no no
C	no no
B	oh right sorry
A	why did you think he was a midget?
B	you said a little man
D	well it's cos he wasn't very tall
B	oh right
D	you know he was just a
C	about the same size as mum
D	no he was a
B	just wondering why
D	well yeah because his little legs were going because we were in the car you know
B	ah so he was going really fast
D	yeah
A	so he was cycling really fast
B	ah
C	and he took us there
D	and he
C	ah that's nice of him
A	it's amazing how kind and helpful people can be when you need
B	they really are
C	out of the blue
A	the amount of times we've had some people just help us for no reason whatsoever

A	no they are genuinely kind and
B	the majority of people are just people

C	zoom what was that? jet stream
D	yeah it's
D	it's been going above Scotland
B	oh yeah
D	and it's come down
B	yeah that's a different stream
D	and
C	Ryanair
A	cos that's what keeps us warm the Gulf Stream
B	yeah yeah there's there's a different stream we're talking about
A	we're on the same line of longitude as like frozen other parts of the world so if we didn't have that our winters would be like minus ten minus twenty like consistently
B	they're not they're damp
A	but it could happen they've found in history that the Gulf Stream has reversed
B	it's gone it reverses every X amount of thousands of years so at any point it could just plunge us into the worst winter ever
D	the ice age again
A	yeah
D	there was an ice age
C	yeah
A	yeah
B	there was definitely an ice age I don't know if yeah
A	what's crazy there's a tipping point in the ice age as well
B	yeah yeah once some once it's
A	once it gets below about middle of France
B	yeah then that's that's
A	the whole world will freeze
B	the whole world will freeze
A	so there'll be an ice age
B	yeah
A	we've had it before where it's come down about so far and then it's still kinda hot in the equator but if it gets down to about southern France so I've heard
B	mm then it's chilled the world enough to the the whole world really
A	the world's cold enough the world will freeze over
D	bit like that erm film
A	yeah
B	The Day After Tomorrow
A	well I was thinking
C	when I have a lager oh when it comes on

D	I mean it's still crazy that there was that you know dinosaurs wasn't there?
A	yeah
B	yeah there were dinosaurs quite a few of them
A	what's crazy is there still are
D	and how many millions of years they existed for
C	instead of being walking about now
A	then poof
D	yeah
A	gone
D	they died
A	although today we still kind of have I mean a crocodile is effectively a dinosaur
B	they're prehistoric
A	they're perfectly evolved they were around at the same time they grow up to like seven or eight metres in length in the sea which is like three or four times the length of your dad they're pretty big
B	just with a bit sharper teeth
A	yeah
D	what's that alligators?
A	yeah crocodiles salt water crocodiles they're dinosaurs effectively
D	crocodiles yeah
A	mm mm
B	mm mm mm
D	well they think some of the fish in the ocean is prehistoric as well
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about school	Contradiction
A	yeah
D	don't they?
B	oh yeah no
A	but they don't need to evolve anymore
B	no yeah
A	they're perfectly suited to their environment it's all good
B	what did whales evolve from? cos they're massive
A	they were sea creatures that came out onto the land and then went back into the sea
B	and then went back into the sea yeah
D	whales?
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about whales	Neutral
A	hence why they breathe
B	yeah
D	oh and they're mammals
A	yeah mammals in the sea will have come out of the sea and gone back in the sea
B	it's probably also why they're
A	theoretically it's
B	I mean maybe not why but they're incredibly intelligent as well so
A	yeah
B	that crossing over
[ANNOTATION]	whales are very intelligent	Entailment
A	you may have found that they never truly left the sea
B	yeah yeah
A	they just kind of were a bit land sea-based and then kind of went back in
B	yeah they are really
D	ladies running around
A	do you know there are
B	yeah you get worried about a centipede coming towards you imagine a bloody whale coming down
A	if you think how inland
B	those little legs
A	how inland Russia is there's no sea in the middle of Russia or anywhere near it there are dolphins in one of their biggest lakes there because of where the sea used to be connected where the sea level was much higher
A	where it was sea that far inland
D	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about school	Contradiction
A	and there are dolphins in the lake
B	yeah this I mean this lake is huge
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about dolphines	Entailment
A	it's huge lake
B	but it's very far from the ocean
A	yeah
B	and it's got all kinds of species of animals hidden in it
A	it's massive it's about as far from the ocean as you can be but there are dolphins in it
D	you ever been to Russia?
B	no no we'd love to go
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about Russia	Neutral
A	well we went through Moscow on the way home
B	oh we did we did very very briefly running
A	yeah we were that was horrible
D	ah
B	in the end we went past we ran past all the people on our flight and basically pushed in front of the queue
A	we were the first on the plane
B	we thought we were late
D	mind you that was like the first time we flew to Italy wasn't it? when we when we
B	yeah went to
D	via Amsterdam and we only had a very small window
B	and mum was guiding us cos I was a child

A	after you weren't sucked in there
B	yeah
A	you'd have got lost with the baggage
C	yeah could have done
B	we laughed about that for some time clearly
D	and at the end
