C	I have
A	yeah
C	with near enough everything else
A	alright there
C	just chop it off that end now please
A	like that?
A	yeah but sometimes with nice bread you have to have to eat it don't you? and then you suffer
C	right now this was a bit like a maze
A	so the lounge is done
C	the lounge is done but it's now full with
A	with stuff oh yeah
C	and
A	mm
C	oh and then once he's done that er we the other weekend the following weekend and what have you he's hoping on the erm Sunday to come and widgy-whatsit it
A	erm so
C	cos it's artexed so
A	oh right
C	that's got to be scraped off
A	yeah so it's yeah that's what we did with
C	yeah and then he's gonna whatever it's called
A	is so what yeah so what do you need? you got bread
C	no just bread and butter
A	you're just having bread and butter
C	yeah
A	and whatever
C	then I can
A	ah
C	er yeah
A	just get you a mat for that just
C	oh and I thought well I can start putting my
A	oh yeah?
C	what you put on the wall
A	yeah
C	oh I've got some of those because of the mirror I've got sort of like all the scrolls and then butterflies and that to put all over the wall
A	oh that'll be good
C	which so when you walk in it's just that one wall the rest of them and what have you are going to be
A	yeah
C	you know just plain
A	yeah
C	oh cos I'll have my wall units and two glass cabinets back in there and then the drinks cabinet
C	oh I've got wait until little 'uns room's finished and he's worked out the bedroom furniture in our room he's worked out how it can go in
A	in yours
C	in ours yeah
A	yeah
C	and then when we can afford it we're gonna buy all
A	mm
C	the bedroom furniture for ours
A	yeah
C	but erm because to have
A	mm
C	you know cos there is not we're four inches short of wall span to have the whole run that we've got
A	oh
C	in the bedroom so that means we'll be over
A	that's so annoying isn't it? when you measure you think exactly this and this and er it's it's even if it's an inch it just
C	yeah
A	it won't physically cos you can't squash wardrobes a bit can you or
C	no
A	or furniture?
C	no
A	well you know what I mean? and it's just that
C	oh
A	little tiny bit
C	this is it so it's gonna be four inches short oh to go across the main wall so that'll be then going across the window? oh by four inches and I said I can't have that
A	mm
C	cos
A	mm
C	oh
A	it's cos you're doing all the rooms as well if it's one room you sort of move stuff stuff gets done
C	yeah
A	and then it gets put back and it's a bit of upheaval a bit of dust
C	yeah
A	and because you're doing different rooms you move stuff from one to the next and into the next
C	yeah
A	so do you think it will all be done by Christmas like
C	well this is he keeps saying you can have it done he says
A	yeah
C	what's holding us up now he says is
A	mm
C	cos once
A	mm
C	which is our bedroom once the units and that get taken out yeah it's gonna be hotchpotch
A	yeah
C	oh until the New Year
A	yeah
C	but I said I don't that doesn't matter to me because
A	no as long as your lounge is okay
C	as long as everything's
A	that you can sit in it and
C	yeah
A	yeah and it's clear
C	and it's clean and tidy
A	and you can get to bed and
C	yeah
A	not have a problem
C	this is it
A	mm
C	erm
A	mm
C	I suppose like they do on the ceiling
A	yeah
C	cos the walls
A	well we had to with
C	mm
A	we had to do the ceilings didn't we
B	yeah
A	and the erm
B	mm it made your arm fall off
A	oh it was really hard work doing it
B	well
A	and couldn't really do it you were doing bits you could do it couldn't you?
B	yeah
A	but it was
B	mm
A	and then
C	you did that then
B	me and
A	yeah
C	well this is it I was
B	the the the roof because me and
A	mm
B	it was just the roof
C	yeah
A	mm
C	I was watching them two and I thought
B	it it's hard work it really hurts
C	yeah
A	mm
C	especially like
B	cos you
C	like the ceiling it's probably harder
B	cos you're at an
C	yeah
B	yeah if you're at an angle it's really awkward
A	mm
C	erm
A	do you want some cheese
C	no
A	you
C	I can't
A	have some of the camembert or
C	no
A	brie with it or something
C	it's just cos it's fresh bread
B	no she'll just wanna have some bread
A	just wanted some bread
C	and butter
B	yep she just wanted
A	yeah
B	some bread
A	that's like me with bread though I
C	mm
B	oh
A	and
C	I love the actual bread
A	yeah
C	mm
A	like and
C	this is it
A	you just have to have a slice with some butter
B	I my theory is
C	oh we all do
B	I'm gonna be eating bad tonight anyway so sod it
A	yeah exactly
C	mm
A	do you know what the meal is er the menu or anything have they?
B	I can't remember what it is off the top of my head
A	oh so you
B	for the main
A	you can choose what you wanted was it or it just?
B	no there's a set menu and then there was either vegetarian or meat
A	right okay yeah
C	oh so it wasn't you know full of gurgling names or anything on the menu then?
B	no
A	I think so it's just
B	mm
A	yeah
C	mm
A	yeah
C	so is it tonight?

A	no we do quite a lot of stuff there from work
B	where anything is ever
A	no well
C	we used to
A	well you'll look at your ticket and you'll see it and then you'll go

A	sometimes it's a bit brown where it's got warm but it doesn't we used to
B	the meat and cheese

A	and I've I've still got on the photo frame here there's one I've still got that picture which is er when you're all there and and everyone's sort of the hoods cos it was cold and all the hoods are down and everyone's looking out like this and that and then who was it? there was one person didn't have
B	probably
A	really realised each other were doing it but someone wasn't and I remember taking that
B	probably
A	could have been

B	I like that one
A	what's that the
B	where you've sort of stopped the
A	yeah stopped and you look back for a photo
C	looks like snow
A	oh that was the car park it's been worn away a bit
C	oh
A	sometimes when you go where you're going you can be in the car park and there's not that much snow cos it's it's warmer down there and it's melted so but when you go up obviously go in the the chairlifts and the
B	I tried explaining this to

A	six seven
C	we never went anywhere
A	mm
C	oh from MFI a real old tent it was bright orange with a blue roof with paisley erm inner tent oh and it got that bad oh after a few years and then with the water coming in even though we'd been sprayed it oh but
A	what's NFI?
C	oh look
A	oh that was her cake yeah two hundred and fifty thousand
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	oh MFI
[ANNOTATION]	The tent speaker C used was bright green.	Contradiction
A	oh MFI I thought you said NFI
C	no MFI
A	MFI
C	the yeah when they used to do things oh and then that's how we ended up getting a caravan
A	mm
C	oh like and then
A	mm
C	it was just a complete disaster of a holiday oh
A	mm
C	and it took him a long while then to get me abroad again
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker C has never gone camping again.	Neutral
B	oh
A	there it is
C	there it is there
A	it was you
B	oh it was me
A	yeah
B	because no yeah
B	yes
C	and I got
A	yeah you had your hat and

[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B never had a hat.	Contradiction
A	no but but it wasn't even
B	no
A	intentional I don't think either but you were both doing that knowing each other was doing it it was just
C	do you oh
A	that needs turning round
C	hello?
A	that's my Top Gun picture
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A owns a Top Gun picture	Entailment
C	oh
A	sorted
B	you have to catch them as they go past
A	yes
C	I haven't got it loaded up and what have you with the photos
A	have you got a memory card in it? how do you how do you put the photos on it?
C	I've got no idea
A	mm
C	no idea
A	oh well bring it across
C	oh
A	and we'll have a look
C	cos
A	have you have you got photos on your
C	it's
A	or are they
C	it's photos and what have you that we've got of
A	yeah
C	oh and then like all the
A	but where are the photos? are they on the laptop or are they on?
C	erm
A	yeah
C	the old laptop before I killed that
A	killed it yeah
C	some of them are on the old computer
A	yeah
C	oh some of them are on my phone so they're all over the rock shop so I really need to get
A	well
C	things sorted
A	if I if I get the op this Wednesday and obviously I'll I mean if I don't I'm gonna be around but we'll sort it after a couple of weeks
C	is it next Wednesday?
A	yeah or meant to be but the the hospital's on black alert for beds which is worse than it was when I it was on red alert when mine got cancelled last time so
C	what
A	don't build my hopes up
B	black alert?
A	yeah they they have a risk for beds so red alert means that there's not that many spaces left and it's getting fairly serious black alert is higher which means it's critical that actually it's emergencies may have to get turned away for certain areas because they can't there aren't there aren't isn't any room
C	how can that hospital end up being in such a mess?
A	it's well it
B	it's the women's centre though isn't it? that's not very big
A	no it's got less
C	I know
A	it's got less beds overall
C	this is this is it
A	than the old hospital
C	when we had the two hospitals I remember a nurse saying to me
A	mm
C	oh that erm they were shutting obviously different bits down in
A	mm mm
C	oh and she said you know once we get sorted there will be less beds than what there is now with the two hospitals
A	yeah
C	less staff
A	yeah
C	less theatres
A	yeah
C	oh and they just bought some new equipment which had been installed in
A	mm
C	oh she said erm you know you would have thought considering that it had only just been bought it would have been transferred through
A	mm
C	but it didn't
A	mm
C	she says that's just all gonna get left in here
A	mm
C	oh
B	but there's more and more people in
C	erm
B	isn't there every year?
A	yeah there's more and more people
C	well this is it there's more and more people here now cos there's more estates but
A	mm
C	haven't they? cos they haven't got the staff
A	yeah no that's it
C	cos it's in such a mess
A	yeah
C	I mean to build a hospital on the grounds of that they was gonna sell the old one to pay for it
A	mm
C	should never ever have been allowed in the first place
A	no
B	I think they don't well the are they the old building's getting redone now isn't it? something's being done to it cos it's all boarded up erm
C	mm
A	yeah I think some someone's bought it
C	but that supposedly
A	to do something
B	they're turning it
C	yeah
B	into flats aren't they?
A	are they? oh the more people for the
C	for the immigrants
A	to go in the beds that
C	oh
B	it's meant to be emergency housing for people coming over that haven't got anywhere to live
C	yeah
A	oh lovely
C	that's what they did say isn't it?
A	mm
C	originally that it was gonna be done but I can't see you know a a a hospital is gonna be in deficit straightaway once it's built
A	mm
C	on the sale of hoping to sell the other place
A	yeah
C	anyway
A	Wednesday hopefully Wednesday I'll be having
C	I didn't realise it was this
A	oh yeah
C	soon then
A	fifth fifth of November
C	so
A	so
C	the first of
A	Wednesday I'll be having it done and
C	oh well fingers crossed
A	if I do after a couple of weeks when I'm a bit more mobile if it gets sorted out it get the stuff over here and and I'll sit and we'll have a look at it and get the but bring the photo frame as well and if obviously I don't have the op then we can do it anyway
C	mm
A	but erm have a look and er we'll look at the photo frames

C	well yeah oh
B	that throws you off
C	but I haven't sort of looked properly when I've come back cos yesterday morning
A	yeah
C	I went out sewing just took my hand sewing cos I thought well I'm only there till twelve oh and then I looked at the last one of them who runs it and her name's
A	mm
C	then she was pulling a sewing machine
A	mm
C	that it's all day sewing
A	mm
C	I'd got it into my head that next week was the last week of October and
A	oh
C	it's meant to be for sewing
A	yeah yeah
C	and she's going what's the matter? and I'm going I'm just a bit confused I says
A	mm

C	and before I knew it you know I'd sort of got tears she said don't cry and I said well I just
A	yeah
C	in a flummox

B	cos you'd been away for a week
A	I like that word flummox
C	flummox
A	yeah
B	when you go away for a week
A	I like that word
B	it throws everything off
C	well it has thrown everything off
B	I don't know where I had been in this week cos I've been off all week I've I've got completely
A	mm
B	completely lost track of where I am
C	yeah
A	I've I've had to say to
B	I'm going skating
A	then I'm coming back home and then I'm going to the rink again and I go what are you
C	well yeah this is it oh but
A	no I just
C	I I and then I looked cos she said you know you've paid for your dinner
C	and I'm like
A	you're not gonna starve
C	okay so then I ring up
B	ah I wondered why you've had mum's
C	yeah mum and dad
A	mm
C	it was lovely though cos as I was driving out of the village alright my mother's face because she could see me driving
C	and it was not news
A	the dogs
C	cos she didn't realise that
A	yeah
C	oh and it was lovely and I see my dad driving cos it's been
A	yeah
B	mm
C	oh well over a year you see
A	yeah
C	that he weren't allowed to drive until he had
A	oh
C	his cataracts done and then they had to pass him that
B	mm
A	yeah
C	that he was fine for driving again
A	oh that's good yeah yeah
C	so it was lovely
A	mm
C	I mean he's driving this morning cos we've got Maddie and what have you I think till Monday
B	they haven't touched Imogen's ear have they?
C	do you know to be honest I couldn't tell you because when I got home yesterday cos I'd made plans to go over and see an old school friend
A	mm
C	because there was cars here there and everywhere which I'm not used to anymore
A	mm
C	so I'd got my ear things in oh and rang
A	mm
C	and then I'm
A	yeah
C	and oh oh it's just total chaos
B	that's why I was surprised that you cos you were driving up erm up north
C	mm well you see when I left it was just coming into rush hour it was five o'clock oh so going only really got an hour of it oh so come half past six or whatever the roads were then just
A	yeah
C	the lorries
A	mm
C	oh
A	but it's
C	yeah this is it
A	so it's good to actually go and even even literally do a loop round at the
C	yeah
A	just practise and keep so you don't lose the skill
C	oh
B	just remember do not just stick your hazards on a stop
B	that's the most silly thing you can do
A	yeah
B	she's done that with me in the car and I told her to turn them off and keep driving
A	yeah
B	otherwise I was gonna take the steering wheel off her
A	yeah
B	and and steer us somewhere
A	yeah
C	how can you take the steering wheel off?
B	I was gonna just drive and turn into a road
C	yeah go can't take the steering wheel off put it her side
B	no I just put I just turned the hazards off and said keep driving
C	oh
B	we're going to turn off into a road when there is one and then we'll look and find out where which way we're going cos that was when we
A	mm
B	were going to we couldn't get into a car park could we to get to the hotel
A	mm
B	erm where the where the parking was for the hotel and we were driving round and round and round trying to get
A	is that when you went to see
B	to the hotel in this
C	oh when
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	and you just stuck your hazards on and I was like do not do that keep going
C	yeah
B	turn off at this road right thank you
A	yeah
B	right let me get the satnav sorted on here
A	yeah
B	and then right let's go
C	oh
A	and if you have a meltdown just hold and
B	yeah let's go into a
C	yeah
B	a road and not stop
C	mm
B	on the middle of a dual carriageway type of road
C	I did that in the middle of Manchester oh is that
A	mm
C	no
B	problem is you do that
C	hazards on and then just stop
B	and someone'll come flying
A	yeah exactly
B	driving along and they don't realise you've stopped and they crash
C	oh
B	into the back of you
A	yeah
B	and end up killing them or killing you so
C	oh
B	just find a side road
C	oh
A	yeah
B	and drive off into that and then stop but don't ever stop in the middle of a main road
C	hello?
A	does he want a French loaf to take now?
C	yeah
A	to beat you with
C	to
C	an extra-large stick
C	French baguette yeah a baguette
B	I just need
C	oh which you could do with now by the sounds of it
B	I want to I'll go and check the ears while I'm doing it
C	but alright well I'll see you when they get home

A	mm
C	that I'd been that they'd bought us oh and I said you know I said erm when will you be collecting Maddie? oh and they weren't sure cos then they asked how long they're staying with cousin
C	the colour that she is now when you return
B	no who took the blame for Imogen?
C	and I take no responsibility whatsoever for her changing colour from white to black
C	dad laughed and what have you
A	mm
C	oh but I thought she ain't gonna be that colour when mum and dad come back to collect her
B	because she's like a little white Westie
A	mm

A	mm
B	isn't she? is she twelve?

C	yeah well today's the thirty-first so she's had it while I've been gone
B	yeah so she's twelve now
B	she's twelve now
A	mm
B	she's getting a little old lady
A	mm yeah
B	and her joints are getting stiff you like Sam's did a bit? so like as
A	yeah
B	she tries to get up she's like oh you know like
A	yeah
B	she's a bit stiff
A	bit more effort and a bit yeah
B	she
C	yeah
B	she still tries to jump up the same way that she always does though but she can't quite jump as high now
C	no
B	so she if she jumps you have to try and catch her
A	oh
B	cos
A	ah
B	she gets her front legs on you but then her bum falls off so you have to try and like
C	yeah
B	catch her like you you grab her round the back like that
A	mm
B	so you've got her head here and then she pulls herself up against you
C	yeah
A	yeah
B	but she still tries to literally like leap and like bound up
C	this is it
B	in one one fell swoop
C	before we went away and that
B	but it just doesn't happen
C	we'd got the cover on the bed and we said come on then and cos there was all er into try and get on well cos obviously
A	yeah
C	Truly doesn't so I have to pick her up but she can jump on the bed
B	she can jump on the bed she just doesn't
A	mm
C	yeah she just yeah I erm Holly was looking and what have you
A	mm
C	with the big beady eyes
A	yeah
C	you know like me me me oh
C	and l'm like
B	mm
C	really high-pitched thing and I'm like I'm coming to you cos her tail was wagging and
B	yeah you have to chuck her on top and Truly on
C	oh cos Imogen's already by this time pounced on the bed
B	and running around and it'll
A	mm
C	so and then Paige has got on the bed but normally it's a second attempt because
B	mm
C	the first one
B	it doesn't work
C	she's not getting up there at all now
B	she's not got the agility in her back legs anymore
C	oh the second time she normally gets up there but once she's up there I'm trying to put Truly on and I'm trying to put Holly on and she's trying to help
A	mm
C	oh and she literally gets them where the scruff is
C	I think I mean she's never had puppies
A	no it's instinct
C	oh but this is it
A	yeah
C	and she's trying to grab them with the scruff and what have you
C	as and I'm like Paige I can do it I'm
C	you know and then she's saying well I'll help too
B	I'm sure she knows that I can do it myself cos she just gets and settles then looks like I'm comfy now
C	yeah oh and then it's like right they're all on oh I think right I'll get in and then it's like well
B	yeah
C	so I'm trying to manoeuvre get over
B	I've started like if I go I I push I I open the quilt on one side and leave it like bunched up quite high cos then Truly will like put her paws in there but she doesn't normally jump into that space
C	oh
B	and then I can sit there and then elbow her out the way
C	oh but erm
B	you have to kind of like shuffle across don't you? and like
C	yeah
B	edge them across and they move and then you get settled and they're all like all
C	but Paige doesn't stay in there very long
B	no
C	she clears off and what have you and then goes back and gets in her own bed
B	yeah she does
C	oh
B	she stays there for a little bit then goes
C	yeah
B	bless her no she's
C	oh
B	no she's got a lot greyer hasn't she?
C	oh
A	mm mm
C	but
B	so is he on nights just
A	oh right
B	from tomorrow then?
C	no he's at work tomorrow night
B	yeah he's on nights from tomorrow
C	overtime and yeah
A	mm
C	and then he's worked Monday
A	should he have been off today then?
C	no he's been off he went to the dentist
B	he wasn't in yesterday was he cos I saw the van there all day?
C	yeah
B	Thursday Thursday was yesterday
C	Thursday
A	mm
C	well he's had two days off he went to the dentist
A	mm
C	oh and after three attempts with injections and stuff trying to numb it oh cos he would start work and then
A	mm
C	so he then injected him again and done stuff and
A	mm
C	oh I'm thinking crikey I'm pleased I don't go to his dentist
C	sounds more like torture
B	it depends like in certain angles like
C	so
A	like it's the
C	yeah
B	these ones here when I had these ones out
C	oh
A	mm
B	one side was fine but the other side I could feel it and he had to inject it
A	mm
C	yeah
B	another couple of times didn't he before I couldn't feel it
C	well this is it
B	and even then I could still feel it but it wasn't painful
C	and then
A	yeah feel it I know what you mean
C	and then he done it again
B	well it wasn't
C	oh and erm he says but when he done the third time oh he injected more than just once and that around in the area
B	mm
A	mm
C	oh he said and then anyway he was in that much pain that night oh cos I said
B	mm
C	you should be taking Paracetamol
A	yeah
C	why? I says because
B	once the anaesthetic wears off and
C	he couldn't feel
A	mm
C	that part of his face
B	that's what I had to do when they took the wisdom teeth out
C	or whatever
A	mm
C	I says and you're gonna know about it if you've had
A	yeah
C	all them injections
A	yeah
B	they suggest that erm when you get out of the
C	oh
B	dentist you take Paracetamol
A	yeah you take Paracetamol
C	yeah but come on it's a man innit?
B	mm
A	yeah
C	do they listen?
A	no
C	no
B	I I took
C	do they do? no
B	Paracetamol once because of my wisdom tooth and then I didn't bother anymore and it was alright after that
C	that's right because I came home Monday
A	mm
C	oh cos he was up and what have you with all the pain
A	mm
C	oh he felt rough
C	oh so he took Paracetamol cos he
A	mm
C	and that that he'd been whacked into him and the dentist said to him he said I don't advise that you go driving and what have you really
A	no
B	no
C	oh
A	mm
B	so he started then to pop Paracetamol and I thought well
A	yeah
C	I've got no sympathy you should have been doing it beforehand
A	yeah should have been on it all the time and it would have yeah
C	yeah
A	kept the level down mm
C	this is it oh but he couldn't eat so yesterday he actually could eat
A	mm
C	oh which
B	bet he was happy about
C	yeah he you know
C	I thought mm
C	oh so
A	mm
C	oh
A	often it's just even the pulling about isn't it? not necessarily what's actually being done to the tooth
C	yeah
A	it's the fact that your mouth's been open and pulled and they're
C	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Person C agrees with Person A	Entailment
A	yanking and
C	and cos it's
A	it bruises it
C	right at the back so
A	yeah
C	you know
A	mm
C	you've got to have your jaw open really as far as you can
A	mm
C	haven't you?

B	mm
A	mm

B	mm
A	oh he's
B	he rejected a couple of things on Adelphi which is a system we put everything through on and we couldn't figure out what it was cos like as
A	oh
B	shouldn't have done and I reckon he's done it because he's stopped being my
A	oh
A	of course yeah so the new boss
B	oh well it'll go through the new boss
A	he's yeah
B	but it hasn't he needed to agree it
A	yeah of course he did
B	it basically means I'm not gonna get my bonus till December
A	oh
B	December's pay packet
A	that's rubbish
B	I
A	and you've got savings and
B	I know it's just
C	yeah but it's the principle
A	no
C	oh of the matter isn't it?
B	it's not it's not
A	yeah
B	is it are you alright to wait? I was like yeah thought I'm gonna have to I don't think there's any other way they can do it
A	yeah
B	cos it has to be agreed and put through
C	this is it
B	and she would put it through today but
C	hang on how many
B	no
C	where are we now then? because obviously
B	how it works is
C	you got that job and you've moved
B	no I haven't changed where I am I'm still in the same area I'm a deputy team leader
C	oh
B	that's all it is
C	but how so but you've changed
B	no no I've still got no basically I my my team
C	yeah
B	so that's
C	yeah
B	in our
C	yes
B	and then the team leader of that command as a whole
C	yeah
B	is
C	oh right
B	so he is my boss's boss
C	oh so he's he's been a
C	an arsehole
B	the old guy well he was a right pain in the bum anyway to be honest like
C	mm
B	you'd try and ask him for things and he'd just take ages deciding and like like with my Christmas holiday
C	yeah
B	he was the one that was like oh oh well I don't know oh well I I can't say oh well I can't look at it now and then he was like well I can't look at it it'll have to be looked at by the new one when he comes up and I'm like just make a decision
C	and is that sorted now?
B	yeah it's sorted
A	mm
B	but that was sort of pretty instantly when the new guy came up within a couple of days he said yeah it's fine and sorted it
C	that's naughty really cos I mean
B	yeah I'm not being funny I worked really hard for it and
C	yeah
B	I asked
C	yeah that's it
B	for it to be put through on a different month so yes I chose for it to be different to other people
A	yeah
B	but that's because I wanted
C	yeah
B	to spread it out
A	out yeah
B	and I wanted to spread the tax out
C	this is it
A	yeah
B	which is smart and nobody else thought of that at the end of the day and I'm I'm one I'm probably one of the only people that's thought of it but that's not that shouldn't be something
A	mm
B	that's going against me I I'm well within
C	yeah
B	my right to put it through as a different month
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	and he's he's rejected it and he didn't think the stupid thing is he's rejected mine and someone else's on the team something they're not their not their bonus it's something else but he didn't email
A	yeah can you tell
B	he just rejected them?
A	yeah
B	he didn't tell anyone
C	with it with it being wages though
A	or tell
C	why you know how can you have the authority to reject wages?
B	it's it's not it's not wages it's bonus it's a special bonus
C	yeah
B	it's not actually wages because our overtime we put through separately and and our team leader agrees that but because it's a special bonus
C	because you've done all those hours over
B	because I've done all those hours yeah because
A	mm
B	it's a special bonus it has to be agreed by her boss
C	yeah
B	whereas our overtime hours she just agrees them and they go through and they get paid by HR
C	so this is
B	but it's a special bonus is paid differently it has to be agreed by someone higher up
C	yeah but if he knows obviously your boss knows that you have done the work and like and he knows
B	he he rejected it
C	he shouldn't be allowed to reject it
B	because it because it's because it's been put through in the time when he crossed over and went down to a different department he's basically just decided that anything to do with our command is nothing to do with him anymore
C	oh he's just being a pompous arsehole
B	he is he he is an arsehole
A	cos he should do that and then just sent he should have sent a message through to either
C	yeah
A	or
C	yeah
A	and said I'm not actioning these just to let you know
B	yeah and he didn't
C	yeah
A	yeah
B	the point is though this is the sort of man that he is my team leader was very very close but if he hadn't have left our command she was gonna make a formal complaint about the way that he treated her
A	yeah
B	he was not a nice person to her at all he like
C	no it sounds that
B	belittled her and all sorts and he was like always really hard on her
A	mm
B	she was really she's new she's new to being a team leader she hasn't been doing it that long and he was really really hard on her and really horrible to her the whole time and actually it constitutes bullying and I used to watch it I used to sit often and think
