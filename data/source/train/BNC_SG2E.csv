A	yeah erm I hadn't it's not something I'd really thought about until my friend
B	oh yeah?
A	and so they had some of their dishes all of their dishes were vegetarian but some of their dishes
B	some of them were
A	when they had V on their menu it meant vegan rather than vegetarian
B	right yeah yeah
A	erm and they had gluten-free stuff and and so on erm and she actually made she made a vegan chocolate cake
B	right
A	much in demand you know she'd make it to order for birthday parties and things
B	mm
A	because if you are a vegan it must be very difficult
B	mm
A	to actually er get stuff
B	yeah
A	mm mm
A	mm there was a programme erm well it was a Horizon
B	uhu
A	but it was actually two consecutive days I think
B	mm
A	or at least two in one week erm about meat eating did you see it?
B	no I didn't
A	erm it was the first one was
B	uhu
A	and to me it was very impressive because
B	I heard about this
A	it wasn't saying
B	mm
A	and quite a lot of it was well actually we don't we're not quite sure about this yet
B	right
A	but the general consensus was
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	and most people's health would be better if they ate less meat than they do
B	yeah
A	in in developed countries
B	it's a very inefficient way of feeding your population
A	yes
B	to feed them meat
A	erm and I
B	mm hm
A	and I was looking at it and thinking I eat at least that much
B	uhu
A	and I'm not a man
B	right
A	you know
B	yeah
A	than one perhaps otherwise would have therefore which is partly to compensate for the lack of potatoes and partly because you can't buy a joint for one
B	right
A	you know
B	yes yes yeah
A	erm and you know I really clearly am eating too much
B	mm
A	and I like vegetarian food so it is a bit silly to eat as much meat as I do
B	you mentioning fish I sorry I think it was the day you moved into this house and I phoned you
A	mm
B	and a rather breathless
A	mm I don't often eat fish and chips
B	right but
A	mm yeah
B	mm
A	erm
B	mm yeah
A	and you know erm if you buy
B	yeah
A	and
B	yeah yeah
A	IE would it be better for me to roast a joint of pork and use some of it use the fag end for my sandwiches or or is it just the same as what I'm buying and and those kind of questions obviously just weren't answered at all
B	right
A	erm
B	mm
A	in contrast to beef pork and lamb
B	right
A	I would imagine
B	also it's
A	mm
B	and then eat
A	mm
B	erm
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	but er they
A	I don't know
A	mm
B	you really do just hang it up and leave it there for a erm eighteen months or so
A	well again you know so if you're buying
B	right
A	so yes it so it was looking at very general categorisations and making some general suggestions and so on but it wasn't answering those kind of detailed questions
B	but then fair enough
B	fine well
A	but if you're actually think of changing your diet you actually need to know the answer to those kind of questions
B	yeah right
A	mm cos
A	you know
B	yes and another aspect of that that would interest me
A	mm yeah yeah
B	and things like that
A	well
B	move from a soya bean
A	mm
B	to something that looks like a sausage
A	they didn't look at that they when when they were looking at the environment they were mostly looking at they were looking at
B	mm hm
A	erm really and
B	no no
A	erm because actually the most
A	not all squashed together
B	mm
A	they had a bit of
B	okay
A	or well they were they were walking around
B	mm
A	but they were still very very concentrated and you know
B	mm mm
A	erm
B	yeah
A	and as you would expect beef was the worst lamb was nearly as bad pork was substantially less and chicken was massively less
B	mm yep
A	but at one point
B	mm mm mm
A	which could have been saturated fats or something like that you know
B	yeah yeah
A	erm
B	mm
A	in in America where you know there's not a blade of grass in sight
B	yeah uhu
A	erm and kept in
B	yeah
A	erm
B	mm
A	a lot lower
B	mm
A	than having them wandering about
B	ah
A	because they were
B	yeah yep
A	erm so they weren't
B	right right
A	erm but on the other hand if you look at then there's other things that you're looking at so
B	mm yeah yeah
A	and what your priorities are
B	yes
A	as to what you actually think is good
B	oh yes yeah
A	which of course is an issue for us
B	right
A	and the the
B	yeah absolutely
A	erm but
B	quite right
A	mm
B	there were the negotiations going on about the free trade area between North America
A	mm
B	and the EU
A	well
B	well yes yeah
A	mm
B	then what do you do? I mean I would say
A	no
B	no but
A	call their bluff
B	yeah
A	cos it's time they learnt that they can't bully the rest of the world
A	I mean the fact is
B	mm
A	produced according to those standards but yeah we do do it with other things
B	yeah
A	good
A	yeah I mean I've yeah it's sort of
B	yeah mm
A	it's not my normal back problem it's a pull here and that is exactly what I got the last time I tried to do that
B	uhu
A	erm which is
B	mm
A	but I'm not well enough grounded in
B	mm
A	erm physiology to be sure about that one
A	I think sorry to be
B	okay
A	I am quite sure what you did last time was look at the start time say oh it'll be fine if I arrive by such and such a time and it wasn't because they're much stricter about it than you we expected
B	right
B	there we go
A	I'll just clear a few of these things mm
B	okay
A	what does it say?
A	mm
B	that's a good bit of mixed English and German isn't it?
B	erm is
A	right so you your aiming for six is absolutely fine
B	I was in fact okay I was aiming to get there at eighteen hundred
A	well I mean as you say that sounds completely reasonable it's just that last time you did
B	right
A	did something
B	right
A	that sounded completely reasonable
B	it sounded but yes exactly
A	erm
A	are you happy with it cold?
B	mm
A	which is a
B	yeah
A	obviously I can put your portion in a dish and zap it in a microwave
B	no no no no no this is fine
A	right well I'm serving some custard and I'm sorry my custard's tinned as well because I actually prefer tinned custard to homemade
B	right
A	I looked for some
B	mm
A	and I couldn't find any at Morrisons Sainsbury's certainly have it but I wasn't gonna go to Sainsbury's just for custard that's
B	right
A	that did strike me just as a little bit we need a spoon you need a spoon
B	yep
A	oh ah
B	thank you
A	so we'll use that to serve cos it's bigger
B	right
B	ah
B	oh yes
A	oh
B	now since this is not connected to the internet
A	and there's
B	it hasn't been for some time
A	yeah
B	so where are these updates coming from?
B	one asks oneself
A	well it's a little bit alarming actually
B	yeah I know
A	which you haven't got so
B	right right
A	and I haven't got cos I've got a router
B	ah yeah
A	mm
B	oh I did tell you?
A	you did yeah
B	okay yeah
A	is it now fixed?
B	mm mm
A	but as you say things like that always happen
B	yeah
A	mm
B	I mean I'll just leave it chuntering away to itself
A	well I wondered if it was in the middle of something when you switched it off when you were connected and it thinks it's still doing it yeah
B	yeah well last time last time I had I had it turned on it was connected
A	mm
B	that was yesterday morning
A	but you'd think if it was in the middle of a job it would have told you as you tried to switch it off then wouldn't you?
B	mm yeah
A	mm
B	mm this is good
A	well as I say I thought if I'm going to have to put up with all those brambles I might as well get
A	mm I mean the only trouble obviously about leaving here at four o'clock is you're right in
B	no
A	erm oh obviously it's noticeably worse these last couple of weeks now that the schools have gone back
B	mm
A	it was it's quite a shock to the system cos you get so used to it
B	to to it not to
A	well I I've never really understood this but I find that the traffic gets steadily lighter week by week from Easter onwards
B	mm
A	the only explanation I can think of is a lot of people enough people are taking their annual holiday at any time from April to July that the number of
B	yeah yeah
A	cos it really you know I don't think it's my imagination
B	and ah I don't know I'm sure one could
A	what?
B	no no no the screen just went blank sorry but it's still it's still
A	oh
B	total nonsense
A	mm mm
B	as I'm sure people who study traffic and so on could tell us this but it could well be that let's say two percent reduction in the number of cars on the road
A	mm yeah
B	if something is just about on the total limit if
A	yes
B	the two percent difference can make maybe an enormous difference
A	that's quite possible yes that would make sense
B	mm
A	mm I had a guy
A	yeah
B	right right
A	you know I mean I would say that's not road but erm he was he it had never really struck me until I met him that that was obviously a a real white collar job and he was very bright and needed to be
B	mm mm
A	to do that sort of thing that it's not exactly comparable with mending the roads
B	no it isn't it it it is a very complicated
A	yeah
B	once
A	mm
B	traffic and so on that's erm just the most about the most complicated model as what you can what you can manage as a mathematician
A	mm
B	or somebody
A	mm mm mm
B	and hanging about smoking fags doing absolutely nothing for ninety-nine point nine percent of the time but you need two trucks there because if you have two incidents erm and you've only got one truck erm then you know the whole of the M25 or the whole of the M56 or whatever can grind to a halt and
A	yeah
B	and
A	mm
B	because if you if you've got thousands of people arriving late for work and so on and so forth and then
A	well and also we transport a lot of stuff on the road I mean that's something that
B	mm mm
A	that
B	mm yeah
A	now I didn't think that America had such a big nail rail nail retwork rail network
A	but maybe that's passenger you know I didn't think that people travelled by train so much I thought they did more they did drive more
B	mm
A	but
B	I know it but I
A	mm erm cos it's something in I don't know which what letter they were doing and what they were talking about
B	uhu
A	but there was something where they were talking about this sort of effect where on a motorway where somebody slows down for
B	mm yes
A	that goes a really long way back and you end up
B	yeah
A	all going slowly and thinking when you and there's nothing
B	right yes
A	is it all and I've experienced that so many times and thought what were we all slowing down for?
B	mm yes yeah yeah installing update eleven of twelve I don't know
A	well he's doing something
B	exactly
A	isn't he? how very odd
B	don't know what he's doing but he's progressing well
A	well when you get taken over by little green men from Mars
B	exactly
A	mm
B	mm yeah I really don't mind whichever
A	well
B	oh
A	so that doesn't really help
B	no okay erm
A	it really doesn't I'm I'm it really really really doesn't matter that it's equally easy to make either
B	er
A	right
[ANNOTATION]	Doesn't that really help out?	Neutral
B	shutting down
A	oh right
B	no little green men waving at me
A	oh well excellent
B	no
B	no
A	well isn't that a bit strange? I mean don't they normally tell you
[ANNOTATION]	That there are no little green men waving at them.	Entailment
B	well possibly if I had had my eyes on it in the beginning it would have said Microsoft update or whatever
A	mm
B	but you know if you said good night go to bed as it were you don't then stare at your computer screen usually you just er
A	yeah
B	er so I said you know go to bed and then glanced at it a couple of minutes later and it was
A	and you hadn't
B	installing updates
A	ever clicked on it to tell it to or is it is yours set up so that it automatically does it?
[ANNOTATION]	That its installing updates.	Entailment
B	it is yes
A	ah right you see mine isn't I would have had to click on whatever it was in the first place
B	yeah
A	erm cos what annoys me and I suppose I don't know any other way they can do it but you go into
[ANNOTATION]	They don't know that it annoys the other person in anyway.	Neutral
B	mm
A	and that's the point to which it says do you want to install an update? and well no not right now because I'm about to do something
B	I'm busy yes exactly
A	erm and so I always say no and then of course I reach a point like I did with the Skype where it actually won't work because
B	right yeah
A	I refuse the updates so frequently er but erm presumably a lot of people just do have their computers on with various things open? which I find weird
B	yeah
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	That they are busy with things to do.	Entailment
B	ah
A	right
B	oh dear
A	ow ow
B	ah oh
A	yes but it's not so much the ow it's the fact that it that I can't get it to work that is really really annoying me
A	and I shall have to stop going on about it because it's quite unconstructive to just keep on tell you how cross I am
A	you know there's a
B	mm
A	is called Settling er and I definitely find that that doesn't that if when you whether it's good for my stomach I don't know but it's certainly not bad for it so
B	okay right
A	erm whereas actually even normal tea
B	really? yeah yeah
A	it's better than coffee but it's still not brilliant
B	yeah yeah
A	mm ah
B	most definitely most definitely
B	yeah yes
A	erm and thinking well I'm not just going to do bloody cheese on toast
B	right yes
B	yeah right no very good indeed
A	so erm
B	mm
A	she's one of those erm but I still think even if somebody tells me that
B	yes
A	and the last time she came there were two of them and the other one is completely vegetarian so you know
B	the
A	so
B	some time ago we had a er well we invited four friends round for dinner and
A	I mean it does make it difficult I mean you would feel very very awkward wouldn't you?
B	and
A	yeah
B	erm
A	right yeah
B	and so we had to have a revised list and so on erm
A	mm
B	it was really quite fun but but bloody hard work trying first of all this time to work out erm a menu as it were and and then in fact cooking things which some of which I'd never cooked before in my life
A	good
B	erm and
A	bloody hell
A	you see
B	I remember you didn't
A	and I ended and we haven't communicated since and one of the factors there was she's a
B	no
A	so and she and she she'd just say oh well just cook what you're cooking I'll just eat the vegetables well no if you're someone who likes cooking you don't want to do it you feel awful
B	yeah
A	and I and a lot of the things she was doing were making me feel like a bad hostess
B	right yes yes
A	whereas if she'd just contacted me beforehand it's not a problem
B	no quite
A	you know
B	quite
A	erm
B	mm hm
A	that it's kind of in your system so although she's no longer in the sort of state that she was as a teenager
B	right
A	so I mean she's slightly taller than me but she we
B	right
A	so we knew we we calculated that she was having about seven hundred calories a day six to seven hundred calories a day and as I say she's slightly taller than me so
B	yeah yeah
A	you know and still a teenager so I mean I'm not saying she was still growing but you know
B	but well yeah but she was to some extent yeah for sure she's still developing
A	just and
B	no
A	it still it it's just awkward when you're the hostess but well maybe it isn't to everybody some people are much more casual about things but it it bothers me I want to get things right
B	and I would I would certainly be annoyed if somebody arrived I mean and when they got here told me that they were you know vegetarian or allergic to gluten or whatever or whatever
A	yeah
B	it's it's just a matter of well common courtesy I would say
A	I would think so yes
B	erm to say so and I mean I've had cases mostly
B	and then you say well erm how about er
A	yes
B	and you can sort of feel the ah yes
B	now sort of you can hear not hear it but feel it coming down the phone somehow
A	right let's take these mugs outside
B	okay
A	I'm just gonna if you take your coffee I'm just gonna switch that off
B	right
