A	it was so long ago
B	yeah
A	it was January
B	a long
A	and that was when we had er we met well with that man
B	yeah had a bit of a yeah
A	had had lunch with them
B	lunch and then dashed off got a tight schedule of that in well it's just like
A	yeah
B	cos it's like when you know when you get so busy and you're just like oh
A	yeah because
B	and you can't find time any time but I think the last few weekends I've literally just been doing nothing
A	see that's like looking a bit opposite to me in the last few weekends I've literally been so manic
B	right
A	I have not been able to be at home like
B	yeah
A	I dunno why like about I think three weeks ago there was this erm big
B	oh yeah?
A	they like one of the parks and town was like every day they had music
B	oh that's really nice yeah
A	and attractions and stuff so we went and hung out there and I stayed round people's houses because I live about ten miles outside of
B	uhu
A	obviously
B	yeah
A	and so I stay round their houses and then the next weekend we had a night out and I went to somewhere else and I was just
B	uhu
A	all over the place and I generally this is the first weekend I've actually been able to like be at home
B	relaxed
A	not see anybody
B	uhu
A	and just do nothing last night
B	yeah
A	was so nice I just sat at home
A	and I watched Young Victoria
B	oh yeah?
A	and just did nothing it was so nice
B	that's what you need sometimes is to have that break
B	after
A	oh yeah?
B	cos I had I booked the whole week off
A	yeah
B	and then my I was meant to be going away with my parents and brother and my brother was like I'm not going with you guys
A	yeah
B	and then so I was like I don't wanna go either
A	where were your parents going?
B	erm just
A	and where did they go in the end?
B	well they didn't go anywhere
A	oh
B	cos I mean
A	yeah
B	he was like oh I
A	uhu
B	he's just like no
B	so I ended just like cancelling my holiday and just taking
A	yeah
B	Thursday and Friday off and I went for a bike ride in
A	oh nice
B	so
A	did you have a
B	I did I bought one back I was like oh
A	love it
B	such a good day like I've we went for like a massive walk and then found the bike shop
A	mm
B	and like let's hire some bikes
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Somene went for a massive walk.	Neutral
B	and it was so much fun I so loved like I'm not I've probably not been on a bike in like
A	but it comes
B	so
A	back to you quite quickly though
B	yeah
A	doesn't it? it comes back to you quite naturally I think
B	yeah it's just the
A	yeah
B	not the pain of the
A	no I've been spinning
B	oh yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Spinning came back naturally.	Entailment
A	you've kind of got to do long distance
B	uhu
A	also like interval stuff
B	oh yeah
A	to get your like
B	yeah
A	aerobic aero robic or whatever how
A	basically you're supposed to like to get you
B	get your lungs get
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B wont do intervals.	Contradiction
A	yeah
B	pumping all the
A	oxygen or whatever some crap going on it's good to do a mixture of interval and long distance
B	yeah
A	so I've been doing that but to do interval training is so boring on a treadmill
B	is it like stop start stop start?
A	yeah so spinning is quite good and it's quite nice to spice up the training
B	yeah
B	is that when you'd literally go for an hour like literally just constant nonstop spinning? I don't know
[ANNOTATION]	Its like start start stop start.	Contradiction
A	er no the spinning like er it's a class
B	you know me
A	and you
B	I still haven't been to the gym ever
A	well you obviously don't need to you're tiny
[ANNOTATION]	They haven't been to the gym in forever.	Neutral
A	but er spinning is like you have tracks and then like the
B	oh yeah
A	or a guy or girl leads the spinning class and then
B	I think I've seen it on TV
A	you have like really fast tracks
B	oh yeah
A	and then you have like thirty second sprint
B	uhu
A	and then
B	yeah
A	and you up the
unknown_female	hi there can I get you some drinks?
A	er yeah could I have a Diet Coke please?
unknown_female	of course
A	and could can we have some water for the table?
unknown_female	a jug of water
A	okay yeah
B	can I get some lemonade please?
unknown_female	pink lemonade or normal?
B	erm normal
unknown_female	normal okay
B	please
unknown_female	have you decided on food or do you want a big longer?
A	no
unknown_female	oh
A	sorry we've been gassing
unknown_female	okay no worries
B	oh my face was like pink
A	I am so hungry
B	no I was like what
A	yesterday I tried to make brownies
B	oh yeah
A	and it it kind of worked and then you know like when you want it gooey in the middle?
B	yeah
A	and you're kind of like is this still raw or is it gooey?
B	yeah
A	and you can't decide whether it's
B	but then it's
A	raw or gooey
B	technically it
A	yeah
B	I tried it like two weeks ago and was trying to get that gooeyness and I think I was like yeah it's done check it out and then half the mixture was still in the erm thingy
A	oh
B	and then I just scraped it and just
A	yeah
B	I was like and cos I felt like
A	I just
B	no one's gonna know
A	it was nice and I ate it and then I binned I did bin some of it cos I was like I can't eat this whole thing
B	yeah but it's
A	then I was like I just couldn't decide whether it was raw or gooey
A	and I kind of
B	or right in the middle
A	I probably can't serve this to people
A	I can eat it but
B	yeah you you end up eating most of it cos you're like oh a bit of ice cream on the side
A	yeah
B	or have it like days on the trot and then like
A	exactly
B	then you feel like kind of bad don't you?
A	but you
B	all of that cos you
A	yeah you
B	eat it all the time
A	you and you look at how much sugar was in it it was something like three hundred grams of sugar I was like fuck
B	yeah that's like pretty much
B	no flour in it
B	it's pretty much just sugar
A	yeah
B	and like it's the best thing at the time and then at the same time
A	it is very nice
B	just like but I I do love a good dessert
A	I
B	I
A	I'm like that I kind of like go through savoury sweet at the moment I'm in very much a savoury time like I do don't get me wrong I would never turn down a piece of cake
A	but if you asked me what are you hungry for?
B	yeah
A	I would probably say to you something like a cheese sandwich
B	yeah
A	or ham or
B	yeah
A	like I'd
B	or a
A	yeah
B	cheese sandwich is always a good one or like a toasted or something
A	yeah
B	or toasted
A	I'm really
B	yeah
A	in a savoury place at the moment
B	oh right
A	I realise that sounds so pretentious and so lame and because I have er hay fever my nose is making me sound
B	just
A	quite dodgy
B	you're just like yeah
A	oh
A	I just I'm in such a savoury phase
A	but
B	oh the joys of hay I I think I've slightly started to get hay fever this year like I'll be like
A	yeah I've never had it before
B	but I've never had it before
A	and like I had a sore throat last week but nothing else hurt and then I woke up
B	mm
A	yesterday morning and I literally my nose was just so bad and I was just like
B	yeah
A	okay may I may have a cold and I was like no no it can't be a cold
B	yeah
B	and you're just like sniffly all the time and it's like
A	yeah
B	you go outdoors just I I'm like
A	oh no
[ANNOTATION]	both are sick	Contradiction
B	and like I
A	yeah
B	yeah it
B	and then like I woke up at midnight and I was like honestly I just wanna stay in bed all day but then
A	yeah
B	by the morning and I kind of got up at about nine and was like yeah I'm good I'm just and then I booked my train tickets cos they'd I forgot I had to do it before I went to bed
A	yeah
B	so I was like you know and think about that okay I'll book it
A	I always do that like I always pre book my even if I know that the price isn't gonna change when I get there
B	uhu
A	but I still pre book tickets just because
B	yeah
A	I know it's so
B	sometimes it's more sometimes it's more
A	sometimes it does change a little bit doesn't it?
B	yeah like it's like when you
A	and it's more expensive
B	go on a Friday or a Saturday and it's changed you know how can it change by like
A	yeah
B	twenty like pounds? but
A	I know it's really ridiculous isn't it?
B	but no this one was not too bad it was like fourteen pound or something cos I thought oh I'll just I'll risk it in the morning
A	yeah
B	but it's not too bad the train journey I've never been this way on the train never go to
A	yeah
B	so I was like
A	I've got to get the train to Stansted in a few weeks but it's only like
B	oh that's nice
A	so we're getting the train from
B	uhu
A	Stansted and it's and it's only something like
B	it's not
A	half an hour it's not that far at all
B	half an hour? that's quite good
A	and it's thirteen pounds and it's really good
B	that's really good
A	yeah cos like could drive or I could get the train
B	yeah you
A	so
A	yeah
B	easier cos you don't have to think about driving cos then you have to drive back and then it's
A	exactly
B	it's that effort
A	and you have to park there and oh
B	yeah that's
A	airports are such a rip off
B	I still like
A	I hate them
B	yeah cos you spend so much money on it I still haven't
A	I'm gonna go for a burger
B	I still haven't looked
A	no no I that's what I was like I'm like
B	right erm

A	yeah yeah that's right
B	but my friend's been like oh I don't you know she's been saying for months oh you know when she's like I'm a bit tight on money but all the budget but she's kind of taking too long deciding
A	yeah sometimes if you have a look on er
B	and it's but like there's like three of us and it's like be like
A	oh
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B works at the airport.	Neutral
B	all that time like I keep on looking and you get so bored with looking if someone's

B	it's no
A	come back over the well erm then you don't you won't come back as regularly and they're like
B	no
A	you won't be so close to all these countries so they try and like make a habit of like once a month or something going somewhere?
B	oh that's a really good
A	and
B	idea though
A	yeah
B	cos it's like you get to actually explore and it's like taking a long weekend

A	no
B	really?
A	and erm they said like a while ago she said to me like I didn't really know her that well at the time but she said she goes me and

A	and then somebody who's like well let's go now and they're like oh well I could go now but and then they never
B	yeah
A	you never organise it
B	it's like a
A	yeah
B	but it's like I wanna go now

[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B intended to catch up with someone	Entailment
B	it would take me like three
A	we didn't really think about it and we just like
B	yeah like
A	and also it's
B	mm
A	and I didn't know it was gonna be that difficult to get to

A	yeah
B	if if it's two and half hours to get there
A	sod it no
B	two and a half hours to get back and I literally would only be there for about
A	yeah
B	two hours and it's and like it's not
A	but
B	it's not really worth it then
A	and then like the last two weekends it's just been manic and because of this stupid training every weekend I've been doing like a run and ten K runs
B	uhu
A	and stuff and I just
B	yeah
A	oh

A	we got on a bit better towards the end

A	three months
[ANNOTATION]	She has three months.	Contradiction
B	three months yeah

B	yeah it's the best way isn't it?
A	but so cold
B	it must be
A	oh
B	I was thinking about it when I was going to
A	yeah
B	like we were gonna it was either Berlin or Dublin and I don't know why I decided Dublin maybe just cos it was like and the whole
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Might go to Berlin but cost more.	Contradiction
B	Paddy's day thing
A	I definitely recommend Berlin though Berlin is an incredible place
B	is it worth going to?
A	really really fun
B	I've not been to I don't think no I've not been to any of Germany before I've not done any of it
A	I've been to quite a bit of Germany cos my godparents
[ANNOTATION]	They haven't been to Germany.	Entailment
B	uhu
A	live there so we go every year obviously but erm no Berlin is definitely the place to go I'd recommend it and there's like
B	oh
A	so much history but you have to
B	uhu
A	you definitely have to balance out the history with
B	the culture
A	something fun because
[ANNOTATION]	You need to balance the history too.	Contradiction
B	yeah
A	if not you're just gonna be very depressed for the time
B	you'd be doing all the the all the touristy bits
A	yeah
B	and be like oh you kind of need that like relaxation
A	you do cos it's like obviously it's so heavy
B	uhu
A	with all like second world war and first world war history
B	yeah
A	and
B	and it's so depressing it's quite like tiring isn't it?
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b thinks relaxation is important	Entailment

A	to er to Poland I don't think it would be very far it's only
B	about two hours
A	took us I went to Turkey in June and it only took
B	uhu
A	three and a half hours to get to Turkey so I think
B	not too bad
A	Poland would only
B	uhu
A	something like that
B	oh yeah?
A	it wouldn't but I don't think it would take very long erm
B	uhu
A	I think Budapest must be incredible
B	yeah same with like Prague and stuff isn't it?
A	yeah Prague's really nice have you been? it's er it's
B	I still need
A	worth going again
B	I still need to go I think I need to do it like
A	yeah
B	I guess it's I wanna do it in the summer but then that's you wanna go to like a beach
A	exactly
B	yeah
A	but there's like the thing with Prague is that's it's really like some of it's it's really oldie worldie
B	yeah
A	and the other part is really heavily communist
B	uhu
A	so like
B	yeah
A	there's loads of like big grey buildings and there's some really nice
A	like pretty fairy tale buildings
B	yeah that's
A	it's very peculiar
B	but the buildings that I've seen like on pictures and they're like oh like the
A	yeah
B	I love that big like old old building and that part of it
A	they're
B	this guy who I work with who sits opposite me he literally goes on like holiday like every few months
B	I think and literally like tells us all about you know it's it's great he spends so much money on like
A	yeah
B	he lives at home he never went to uni he works I think he's been working since like eighteen in like a
A	yeah
B	better position than all of them and he literally just spends all his money and has no savings but gets to see the world
A	exactly you've got to balance it haven't you? like I think in the winter I save and then in the summer I spend
B	uhu
A	cos you just wanna go everywhere in the summer
B	it's true yeah I've been saving quite a lot so like I can spend it now
A	you live at home and I'm so jealous I pay something like what do I
B	yeah
A	between five fifty and six hundred pounds a month
B	yeah
A	to live in
B	uhu which is yeah
A	which is well cos you that's
B	which is not London
A	live outside of
A	to live inside of
B	is it's is it really expensive?
[ANNOTATION]	it's cheaper outside lots of European cities	Neutral
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a has a place to live	Entailment
A	really expensive like my mum kept being like
B	uhu
A	mother do you have four hundred thousand pounds to spare?
A	no I don't
A	and for like a two bedroom flat
B	it is really ridiculous isn't it?
A	in the centre of
B	seriously? wow
[ANNOTATION]	but it's actually pretty cheap though, in actuality.	Contradiction
[ANNOTATION]	the appartment is not cheap at all	Entailment
A	for two bed it's like a two bed flat
B	that is it just that you think I know that it's it's that
A	yeah and it's so close to London and it takes by train it's forty-five minutes to get to London
B	yeah
A	into the centre
B	it's the perfect it's the perfect kind of
A	yeah
B	boundary isn't it to get old and new world and all that kind of stuff
A	yeah it's nice to get like out of London but it's just so expensive
B	uhu
A	and it's full of tourists
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	the cheapest is a three bedroom flat in the city center	Contradiction
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a will live away from the London city centre	Entailment
A	and it's not just like you can understand
A	everywhere
B	like every weekend
A	yeah
B	uhu
A	there's just so many of them
B	yeah
A	like obviously it's very nice that they come and they see
B	yeah in that way sort of
A	in that way but it's just
B	it gives it the money doesn't it? that it needs
A	yeah
B	in a way
[ANNOTATION]	yeah, and tourists are always slowing things down, probably help make it so expensive	Entailment
[ANNOTATION]	not many tourists visit the area	Contradiction
A	and keeps its like prestige and stuff and it's just
B	uhu
A	there's so many of them and they all come at the same time and you just
B	but it's that few weeks in like
[ANNOTATION]	some tourists are good for the city though	Neutral
[ANNOTATION]	tourists are so scarce	Contradiction
A	yeah
B	August and you're like then they then they won't be back for a
A	but
B	I guess but you prefer it better than
A	yeah much better so much
B	uhu
[ANNOTATION]	there's a ton fewer tourists in the summer months than winter, actually	Contradiction
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a doesn't think it's better	Contradiction
B	yeah
A	centre is really small so
B	uhu
A	more people live further out
B	yeah
A	and then you have to travel into the centre which takes longer and it's further away whereas
B	uhu
B	oh yes so it's kind of easier to isn't it?
A	so it's easier to like there's more going on
B	uhu
A	and then it's it's easier to have it's yeah and the shopping is better and
B	better social life and that kind of stuff
A	yeah exactly
B	that's good
B	uhu I'm getting bored of
B	I know it's like you just you forget what's around and
A	yeah
B	all that that like getting out and about and like it's just you know
A	yeah
B	I just get sick of the same thing cos I see like so
A	yeah
B	but you just sort of you know the buses going and then when I go out for the day and I just see some green and was like oh I've not seen green in ages
B	which is so sad
A	yeah it is actually
B	but okay
A	are you thinking of like moving job or changing job at all?
B	I don't know so well so far I'm gonna stay at my job for the next maybe year cos I was thinking mm
A	would you like to move to London?
B	well I was thinking about it and then I thought the amount of money I'm saving
A	you'd blow it
B	I'd I would have
A	you'd be rinsed in London wouldn't you?
B	I would literally I would have no cos I cos I went to see
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	and er er I can remember when I was living in London a few years ago you just have no money to go and do things and you literally have like
A	yeah
B	like one holiday or you just
A	yeah
B	what you do
A	and also like just like going out for drinks
B	yeah
A	is a good thirty forty pounds like it's not
B	like a tenner
A	yeah it's not like you can just socially go out for a few drinks it's like it costs you a lot of money
B	yeah
A	to go out in London and even just working in the city centre you'll find like you get a cup of coffee every day
B	yeah
A	go out for lunch like it all adds up
B	you do you
A	you end up spending a
B	yeah
A	like a lot of money
B	and you'll always go out for lunch you'll never make your own lunch and
A	no
B	it's like cos like why why if I can just go downstairs and
A	exactly
B	go to a nice place?
A	exactly yeah
B	at at home I can just
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	someone is not good with money	Entailment
B	take my own lunch sometimes
A	yeah
B	and like I I think I've just learnt how to live I cos I still don't use that money that I do earn like and I still live like in a good way so if I did
A	yeah
B	I know that I I I wouldn't have to like scrimp or anything cos I know
A	yeah
B	but I just feel like if I have that money just when it's just gone
A	exactly that's what I don't like I don't like the idea that you go to London and you pay
[ANNOTATION]	someone desires to go to London	Entailment
B	yeah
A	for something that you could buy at a reasonable price two hours up the road
B	it's true and I couldn't afford to buy anything in London so
A	the houses you couldn't even buy a grotty house in London
B	no
A	for like
B	somewhere in the outskirts
A	a decent amount
B	kind of yeah it's like
[ANNOTATION]	London is expensive	Entailment
A	yeah
B	what I just don't understand how
A	yeah
B	and friends and family cos I remember when I was living in I was home every three or four weeks just cos stuff's always going on
A	mm
B	social like oh it's just
A	yeah
B	the balance is just not there until I decide oh unless there's an amazing job that I can't turn down
A	and pays you something like
B	and pays me
[ANNOTATION]	two people are rich	Contradiction
A	forty grand
B	yeah and
unknown_female	there we go got the the sorry that's the Bill's burger
A	the burger's mine thank you
unknown_female	you're welcome would you like any sauces at all?
A	er
B	erm
[ANNOTATION]	burgers are available to order.	Entailment
A	can I have some ketchup please?
unknown_female	yeah
B	can I get some mayonnaise?
unknown_female	ketchup and mayo sure
B	oh this looks great
[ANNOTATION]	two people prefer ketchup most	Contradiction
A	I know
B	I need a chip for yeah er yeah I'm not leaving my job
A	oh
B	so
A	oh yeah cos
B	nearly
A	nearly oh you
B	until I think it's
A	they'll keep you on
B	all this time literally like we had reviews you know like April May time but no one knew what was going on like people were changing roles again or
A	yeah
B	if the managers decide where we go like we knew we weren't gonna they're not gonna let us go
A	they always
B	because
A	keep you cos what's the point of training you for two years to let you go? unless you're like shocking
B	yeah cos it
A	yeah
B	at the start like you wouldn't wait like a whole
A	that's the point of probation isn't it?
B	two years yeah but then they just they weren't being really like
A	thank you
unknown_female	you're welcome
B	which is thank you
unknown_female	enjoy
B	yeah so that they're like we don't really know what's going on and they they haven't really decided
A	mm
B	but my mind lit up well at the same time he told me that he's leaving
A	oh
B	so he's going back to
A	yeah
B	oh if you yeah by the way your job's still there if you want it you know
A	yeah
B	you know all that
A	I know it's really annoying I started my job in December
B	uhu
A	and then had a six month probation period which was fine and I passed that obviously erm but then my manager in
B	mm
A	was like oh yeah I'm I'm leaving and I was like oh
B	yeah it's kind of like you get used to the person
A	yeah
B	and your team and stuff like my team's like three people so when he goes I'll be the one who knows the systems
B	like the most and it's really
A	mm
B	make sure like tracking and like stuff that you know the teams need is correct and it's not and like ah
A	yeah
B	until like
A	yeah that's the thing like erm
B	I don't know how it works
A	like it's really annoying cos my manager left and they have they have replaced him but
B	mm
A	they've it's really annoying they've replaced him with a woman who was on the maternity leave
B	that's
A	when she does come back she's only coming back part time
B	so then she's literally not gonna be there
A	no
B	if it's maternity
A	and then I'm like okay that's fine great
B	uhu
A	and then like the woman who's supposed to be our line manager at the moment is the head of our department
B	yeah
A	and she never has any time for us so I actually haven't had a one on one meeting with my line with a line manager
B	uhu
A	since May and it's now what the beginning of August
B	that's like the worst thing though isn't it? it's like
A	yeah
B	you don't know where what you're doing and where you're going or
A	and like she sends like emails like oh I'm always here if you need me you know you're doing brilliantly and I'm like how do you know that I'm doing brilliantly?
B	uhu
A	like I could be failing for all you care
B	uhu
A	I'm not
A	it's just like it's really annoying I was like
B	uhu
A	I don't want an email I want you to have a meeting with me
B	yeah and be there in person or whatever
A	mm
B	not the same is it when they're not there?
A	yeah
B	I remember you saying that you were gonna do
A	I wanna do it just
B	or another degree
A	fitting it in like I started trying to do the
B	uhu
A	and stuff so I have to just slightly revaluate but I still my aim is still just do it over the
B	uhu
A	next few years
B	yeah
A	I just gotta plan it out a bit more
B	it do they do it with like the Open University or that kind of stuff or
A	mm
B	is it is it like you have to go to
A	you can do it through like online courses and stuff but
B	uhu
A	I don't know if I learn that way
B	uhu
A	I found it quite hard so
B	uhu oh it's
A	it
B	it's tough isn't it thinking if you
A	mm
B	yeah
A	it's just finding time
B	uhu that's what's the hard thing cos
A	yeah and like when you're at uni obviously you never stop thinking about work but I like the fact that when I leave work
B	you switch off
A	yeah I no longer like care about it
B	yeah I think I care less you know how like when I was at uni I really wanted to do well and
A	mm
B	and get to the top and now I'm like oh I like my social time and relaxing cos I just
[ANNOTATION]	it's important to do well while at a university.	Entailment
A	same
B	I think you at times you can get really stressed at what you do and then you need to switch off like you see that
A	mm
B	for managing directors you know you know they're always
A	mm
B	if you don't get to actually switch off when you get to that level like probably one day but at the minute it's like I want my social time I want to just
A	same
[ANNOTATION]	people don't really need vacations too often.	Contradiction
B	chill out I wanna go home on a Monday night and just watch stuff on TV
A	Wednesday night and watch the British Bake Off
B	does that start this week?
A	oh yes it does
B	that's it feels like it you know when you think that it's not been that long though since they like finished I remember that
unknown_female	sorry to interrupt you ladies how is everything?
A	it's good thank you
B	lovely
unknown_female	do you want any more drinks at all?
B	I'm good thanks
A	I'm alright thank you for the moment
unknown_female	okay
B	just remember that the that young the kid who
[ANNOTATION]	The waitress has worked here for at least ten years.	Neutral
A	oh yeah
B	that's where but I do like I
A	mm
B	or make cakes or they'll start like at work they do that and have competitions like oh I'm best
[ANNOTATION]	they order more drinks	Contradiction
A	I dunno I just
B	bake offs
A	I think I've just resigned myself to the fact that I'm never gonna be a good baker
B	I'm very bad
A	I am yeah I'm
B	uhu I think it tastes good for myself but but other people it just doesn't like it wouldn't cut it
A	yeah I'd never serve it to somebody
B	I do occasionally try to bake cakes for people and then not just for like
A	mm
B	like the bits that you can cut up into pieces and I like decorating them and all that stuff but
A	no
[ANNOTATION]	it takes a lot of work to be a good baker	Entailment
B	probably no
A	I made a Victoria sponge the other week for my grandad and that was actually quite good
B	uhu
A	but apart from that no
B	uhu
A	I don't
[ANNOTATION]	it's more fun to bake a cake for a large group of friends than for just a few people.	Contradiction
B	you need to yeah
A	find it satisfying I just want to eat it so
B	uhu yeah you
A	I just go and buy a cake
B	exactly well I guess yeah there is some really good cakes you can get
A	mm
B	but you see I or I'd tell you know when you can you can't find what you're looking for and then you
A	yeah
B	have to make it and then it doesn't taste as good as you think it's gonna taste
A	no
B	and then you just get sad that it doesn't taste good that's the best that's the worse yeah
A	and it's annoying when you go to somewhere like the
B	uhu
A	and you try all of their cakes and then you buy their book and you try and make the cake and
B	uhu
A	it's just like no
B	no I've never never been there
A	oh my god you have to go
B	there was that time where we thought we were gonna go it was that that time were we doing them do one of them classes?
A	oh yeah
B	and then we never did them
A	no
B	yeah but I've
A	they're really nice
B	aren't they?
A	I had one of those
B	uhu I need to go back to London at some point
A	I do love going to London
B	uhu
A	when
B	it's good after a while cos I remember when I went in
A	had you not?
B	you know like walking the streets and like
A	yeah
B	for like ages so I was like I think I saw
A	oh
B	I was like I mean I've not seen you in like a year and a half and I haven't really spoken to you but
A	uhu
B	but
A	yeah
B	on like on text and stuff
A	same I'm awful at
B	uhu
A	aren't good at it?
A	yep
B	and I'm hopeless at texting but there's times when I'm on the trains and I'll I'll kind of be like I text people
A	mm
B	and like oh how's it going cos I've not
A	yeah
B	or
A	mm
B	that's the strange thing but you get better I just need a new phone
A	I'm erm
A	like I love it
B	oh that's quite cool
A	and erm
B	uhu
A	erm couture and you know fashion exhibitions and stuff so
B	I've been I've been to one of their dress ones years ago
A	yeah I go to them quite a lot
B	uhu
A	obviously cos I'm a member and so she comes and that's kind of like the thing that we do together
B	yeah
A	to meet up and catch up
B	which is nice yeah
A	cos she still lives in
B	uhu
A	and she comes from
B	uhu
A	and have coffee and it's just a nice excuse to go to London
B	uhu
A	and to have a catch up with somebody
B	definitely true cos it's like it's something different isn't it?
A	mm
B	at the same time cos it's always like
A	yeah
B	uhu always the best bit
A	mm
B	cos up in London you know when you go down like and see these random museums and like on these like side streets and you're like oh that's quite cool
A	yeah
B	like not you know out of the hustle and bustle you're like oh that's well strange
A	yeah my dad took me to the Benjamin Franklin Museum and few weeks ago and that was
B	uhu
A	it was quite interesting and I guess it's probably not something I would have chosen to go to see
B	uhu
A	but seeing it was quite interesting
B	yeah they're always quite cool
B	so they had it's not really a museum it's just like a
A	yeah
B	so well they had erm they had massive
A	how did the leprechaun happen?
B	he just I think it was just to do with people
A	like folklore?
B	yeah it's all the
A	yeah
B	that's how they kind of got so that kind of bit of it and then I think it was something they said something about there was I think there was a Disney film like forty fifty years ago like or
A	yeah
B	leprechauns in them and then they
A	I like folklores and stuff like that though
B	uhu
A	I mean my god why am I covered in little spiders?
B	oh
A	go away oh they've got hundred living everywhere
B	mm the worst thing
A	what are you doing?
B	they want the food that's what they want
A	then I got a bug on my back for Christ's sake insects what was what is going on today?
B	I think that's the only worse thing about eating outside
A	yeah the bugs
B	like bugs everywhere I should have tied up my hair
A	that's why I
B	uhu
A	oh my god and there's a kid with a
B	as always
A	Minion hoody
A	we went to see the Minions movie it was absolutely the worse movie I've ever seen in my entire life
B	is it worse than the first and second one?
A	no like yeah well yeah and the Minions movie was kind of separate from Despicable Me
B	uhu
A	and it was awful
B	really?
A	yeah
B	I I haven't seen a kids' surprisingly I haven't seen a kiddie film in ages
A	have you not? oh we went to see
B	we went what did I see?
A	we went to see Inside Out last week and that was actually quite funny
B	I saw erm what was it? Big Hero 6
A	oh I saw that as well
B	and I thought that was quite cool
A	yeah I quite liked it
B	and I thought it was quite grown up
A	uhu
B	and I was like oh that's quite sad but I haven't seen anything since
A	I'd recommend Inside Out
B	uhu
A	it was quite funny
B	that's
A	really liked it
B	that's the one with all the emotions isn't it?
A	yeah
B	but no it's call no I've
A	mm
B	the other week well last week and I thought that was quite good ended up watching the first second third like the last three weekends when I was like haven't got a lot to do let's watch
A	yeah
B	three of the old films and I couldn't
A	yeah
B	I was like I'm sure I've watched it but I have no
A	uhu
B	and the only one I remembered was erm I think it's the you know the third well the bit when the I think it's the third when where they find the phone in the poo
A	no
B	in this poo but that's the only bit I remember from like years ago and I was like oh
A	I've actually never
B	mm but I preferred the third one which was probably like the worst one which is strange but no
A	I'm not I don't really go the cinema that often mainly cos it's just so expensive and I hate paying like
B	it's yeah
A	ten pounds to go to see a film that I don't think is very good
B	that is true I wanted to see what else did I go and see? erm a film called Age of Adaline
A	mm
B	I went to see that I thought it was kind of a different film but it's kind of like the whole
A	it was Blake Lively wasn't it?
B	yeah
A	oh Gossip Girl
B	go and watch her film so it
A	no
B	and I thought let's go and watch that it's something a bit different
A	yeah
B	but it's like I yeah like what else do you do for the like
A	mm
B	day out but not really a lot
A	oh have you?
B	it's been coming out for ages but then it stops er and starts and then stops and starts and then sort of like every other weekend it's like oh it decides to be like annoying but
A	mine I think mine are coming through
B	mm?
A	like I had an x ray a few last year and erm
B	mm
A	they were in there but they couldn't see them
B	oh yeah but
A	like they couldn't see them properly
B	uhu and pretty much like
A	and their phrase was we're not gonna go hunting for them I was like that's fine
B	uhu
A	please don't
B	yeah
A	erm I'm sure I have them and they will come through one day but they're not
B	uhu
A	imminent
B	I'm going to see how yeah well I'm going to see in the next few weeks if it doesn't stop you know it's been like going on for like the last six months on and off like not it doesn't really hurt it's just the other one the other side and then other one's gonna
A	mm
B	cos they're both coming out at different times but I don't think there's enough room
A	oh yeah that's the problem isn't it nowadays
B	so I need to go and get them checked well er for an x ray but I hate anyone touching my teeth like years ago when I had braces I just hated
A	mm
B	like braces and all that stuff so
A	I'm going to see the hygienist on Tuesday I've never been to the hygienist before
B	uhu oh they just they just clean your teeth don't they?
A	yeah but apparently
A	I'm not looking forward to it
B	yeah I wouldn't want to be one of them either
A	no and they pay you they pay you to hurt you I'm like what the hell?
B	erm they pay you
A	no you pay them
B	yeah okay
A	to hurt you so you could pay them
B	that's true that's true
A	pay them to do it and it's like what?
B	yeah
A	it's like fifty quid
B	no it's not worth it
A	I've never been before so I thought I probably should go
B	uhu yeah I've never been I don't they that many well I dunno no one's ever said they go to the hygienist before to me
A	quite a lot of adults go
B	uhu
A	like proper adults
A	like obviously we're adults but you know like proper adults go
B	uhu
A	my parents go quite often
B	mm no I feel like a child living at home
A	that's the thing
B	like eighteen and I feel like I'm like eighteen to twenty
A	yeah
B	that's how
A	I think
B	uhu
A	I still look to somebody older than me for like advice and everything
B	uhu
A	I don't that it's like
B	no?
A	at the moment a lot of my friends are a lot older not a lot older than me but they're older than me
B	uhu
A	so like I'm the youngest really out of my friendship group and the rest of them are between like twenty-five and thirty
B	uhu
A	and like the oldest one is twenty-nine
B	mm
A	and none of them all of them are just like I've got no idea what's going on in my life
B	yeah just
A	get
B	undecided it's like er loads of people are travelling that's what I've found
A	mm
B	er but in the last year or since I started five of them have gone travelling
A	I think you've got to do it you've gotta go travelling
B	gone to Australia or
A	yeah
B	having a good time or they've left and
B	and not done it but that's pretty much what people are like they're either gonna be like oh we'll settle down or we'll go travelling and that's pretty much what people are doing in a way
A	I don't think I'm gonna be the settling down type
B	mm
A	it's like when we met met up
B	uhu
A	with like
B	oh yeah
A	and they were just like they've got their house and everything and I was like fuck what?
B	I was like yeah
A	they were like mortgages and everything I was like how on earth do you have mortgages?
B	that's way too grown up I so wanna go
A	yeah me too
B	or even if I don't take actually leave a job and go travelling just like take off like two weeks and go you know do a new
A	I do
B	I
A	it depends on whether you're gonna work where you are or not
B	uhu and that's true
A	true well you'd go with somebody wouldn't you?
B	uhu that's true
A	well no but I think a lot of people do want to go they're just a bit scared
B	uhu
A	and like like you you know they're scared about going alone and I think
B	uhu
A	that's er like a common thing
B	uhu
A	I'd like to go
B	uhu I wanna do like like Bali and Indonesia and all that
A	mm
B	that kind of I could see a bit of Australia
A	yeah
B	road trips around America and stuff like
A	but I've been to America
B	doesn't
A	and it doesn't really appeal to me
B	doesn't appeal to me cos there's no there's no like there's nothing really
A	yeah
B	I've always like
A	but like
B	uhu
A	maybe I could go with her
B	if not go and visit for a a
A	yeah
B	bit then be like you can show me Australia come travelling round
A	go round Australia
B	yeah cos I'm sure they've like done bits and bobs of Australia cos they like when we live here we don't go and do bits
A	yeah
B	do bits and bobs so you probably I mean wherever you live you probably don't go either side and everything
A	yeah
B	as much you probably go
A	cos I was talk I was talking to
B	uhu
A	you've never been to Sydney for New Year's he's like why do I need to go to Sydney for New Year's? I'm like
B	uhu
A	and there's fireworks and he's like yeah but there's fireworks in Brisbane I was like
B	well it's true
A	but it yeah exactly but because I'm a
A	and he's just like mm yeah and then I realised I'd never I've never been to London for for New Year's
B	no me neither I've always thought about it and then again and all that way and then
A	it's too cold and it's just
B	it's too cold to go on my own well not on my own but
A	it's gonna be really busy
B	like with people
A	and I er
B	I don't really like New Year's that much
A	I love New Year's
B	there's I think there was a time that I went out with all my family and all my cousins my age well our
A	mm
B	just haven't really done a lot
A	I'm like the opposite
B	I feel a bit sad
A	I love New Year's and don't really like Christmas
B	uhu
A	I find Christmas such like a hype
B	uhu
A	for no reason like
B	uhu
A	just don't like it at all
B	I do like Christmas
A	it's really boring
B	it's I just hate people arguing at Christmas
B	mum's always like moaning like you know and
A	yeah
B	don't need all that stress just have have a good time
A	I think it's because
B	and be
A	we don't really do that we don't get together like my sister last year wasn't here she was
B	uhu
A	in Paris cos she was working my grandparents
B	uhu
A	just me and my mum my dad and my grandma
B	uhu
A	and it's like well what can we do?
A	well
B	just like a normal day isn't it?
A	yeah it just becomes like a normal day like I just sit there and watch TV and mum cooks and dad goes cycling or something and it just
A	kind of ends up being one of those days that nothing really happens
B	uhu
A	I think we used to have like when all my like all my aunts and uncles used to come round and then
B	yeah
A	one of my aunties just basically the last few years was like I'm not cooking I don't really you know she's not really the cooking type so she kind of like stopped like family big reunion kind of thing so we all do our own thing now which is kind of mm kind of gets
A	mm
A	do you do like erm English Christmas or do you have like Indian food at Christmas?
B	kind of do like chicken or turkey and
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	try to do something a bit different and have like like
A	yeah
B	pretty much just a big feast of food
A	nothing wrong with a big feast of food
B	a few samosas doesn't hurt at Christmas
A	I love food in general to be honest
B	uhu it's the best bit
A	it really annoys me when people go on like
B	uhu
A	and she like won't eat any carbs and she's like
B	nothing? no potatoes no bread?
A	no
B	no pasta?
A	I'm just like why?
B	what do you eat?
A	yeah just like vegetables and shit and you're just like don't get me wrong a love a good broccoli broccoli sets me up quite well actually
B	uhu
A	I love it
B	no
A	no and they just yeah but it's just so stupid it's like oh if I eat bread it'll make me fat it's like
B	but it's
A	it but it's like well if you do exercise and
B	you eat it for balance isn't it?
A	yeah
B	you balance it like
A	like it doesn't matter
B	yeah
A	if you eat one thousand calories of vegetables or one thousand calories of bread it's still a thousand calories it's not
B	it still affects you in the same way doesn't it?
A	yeah it still it's still calorie content and it's just oh it just annoys me
B	cos you can get goodness from like carbs as well like
A	you do yeah of course you do
B	it's energy isn't it? energy energy
A	yeah
B	that's one of them isn't it?
A	people need carbohydrates to make your like brain function
B	uhu
A	like the carbs are essential to your bodily to bodies your body function
B	that that's true I guess yeah I don't really I just eat what I want which is probably the worst thing
A	no it obviously works for you dear so
B	yeah but I could be like have all the nasty fats in the inside and be like
A	nah
B	you just can't tell but I could be really unhealthy in the inside you never know
A	you could be but it doesn't really matter
A	who cares?
B	no I just eat what well yeah the worst thing
A	I
B	at lunchtime I get I get
A	yeah
B	basically
A	you've got to enjoy what you eat
B	uhu
A	and like I do not enjoy just boiled chicken
B	no
A	why would I just eat boiled chicken?
B	no
A	one of my friends does cos she's trying to like
B	what like is she bored?
A	build she's trying to get stronger so she's like going to the gym and stuff
B	uhu
A	so she just eats chicken all the time and it's just like
B	it it
A	and I refuse to go to a restaurant and buy a salad I'm sorry
B	uhu
A	it's like ten pounds for a salad
B	yeah
A	it's like I could make this myself er technically I could make a burger myself but you know
B	it's the whole
A	the principle of it if I'm gonna go
B	uhu
A	okay
B	you get more for your money
A	exactly
B	I did that yesterday and I ended up getting erm I wasn't that hungry anyway cos I had a massive breakfast
A	no
B	it's like worth like four pound or something and there wasn't even a lot of chicken on it and like come on
A	that's the really annoying thing isn't it? like when you order something and you actually have to like hunt out the protein
B	uhu
A	it's like this is supposed to be I had what did I have? I had a goat's cheese in quinoa salad the other week
B	uhu
A	it was a really a really nice salad and I had it with something
B	yeah
A	and there was about five bits of goat's cheese in it and I thought
B	well oh that's the worst bit
A	you are
B	isn't it?
A	yeah I was like
B	just like this
A	yeah
B	drizzled it everywhere
A	it's like I love goat's cheese give me some goat's cheese
B	uhu
A	that's why I ordered the goat's cheese salad
B	uhu
A	I didn't order salad with a drop of goat's cheese did I?
B	that's it it's like you get more salad than
A	yeah
B	you actually do the thing that's meant to be the main part of the salad
A	yeah
B	which is like the worst bit it's like it should be like equal portions and
A	exactly
B	like
A	yeah
B	like if it's too
A	but you still want a little bit more than
B	yeah
A	if you if you order a chicken salad you expect there to be a decent amount of chicken in there don't you?
B	uhu
A	if there was like two pieces I would not be happy
B	yeah at least like a
A	yeah
B	like on the side like what
A	yeah
B	you'd put in a burger but you would have like half of that
[ANNOTATION]	too much celery would make it not good	Entailment
A	yeah if you ordered a burger and you had to like you
B	uhu it's like you don't how to ask for it either but it's can I have extra chicken or
A	yeah
B	have a normal portion of chicken?
A	but also what really annoys me is you know when you order pate and they give you like a massive slab of pate
[ANNOTATION]	like a couple pieces of chicken is sometimes okay, right?	Contradiction
B	uhu
A	and then
B	no bread
A	two bits of bread and you're just like and not even like a slice and like you know two triangles of bread
B	oh yeah
A	and you're just like
B	you can't eat it all
A	where's the logic? yeah
B	I know
A	you know
B	but I don't I don't yeah
A	that I'm gonna ask for more bread
B	yeah that's shit they'll always give it you but they don't give you more to start with so you don't feel like oh can I have more please?
A	yeah
B	cos then it's like
A	cos you end up having like this tiny piece of bread with a massive load of
B	oh come on
A	pate on
B	I'm having a bad day
A	oh what have you done?
B	I've dropped my food
A	have you dropped something?
B	it's only mayonnaise
A	ah
B	ah well I just
A	what a nice day
B	hide it
A	it's been really bad
B	it's lovely isn't it?
A	this week hasn't it?
B	uhu
A	it rained mainly
B	well it chucked down Monday Tuesday and Wednesday so I was
A	yeah
B	I was happy I was I work Monday morning at half six waiting at the bus stop I was like
A	yeah
B	I was like yeah
A	it
B	uhu
A	about no I get up about six half six and then get to work at half seven
B	yeah
A	and it was kind of the
B	uhu
A	and then like it hits like at half past eight and it suddenly the heavens open
B	yeah
A	and it starts chucking it down
B	and it chucks it down like er the afternoon when you leave
A	yeah
B	work and you're like come on you've been fine all day why can I not have a
A	exactly
B	cos I've been like I bought some like erm erm trainers to go running or something and I was like I'm gonna do it I'm gonna do it
A	yeah
B	and then like no I'm not
A	no I'm not
B	no I'm not
A	yeah
B	it's just awful weather like or
A	it really is
B	go and play some tennis or something but then I'm like it just chucks it down the whole time
A	yeah
B	like
A	it makes you unfit
B	it's true cos I just sit and watch TV and crap on
A	eat
B	and eat
A	yeah
B	yeah just pretty much the eat
A	that's the problem with the winter isn't it? like that's why people put on weight in the winter because they just sit inside and eat and watch TV
B	that's true
A	in their little cocoons
B	uhu
B	uhu I'm like November onwards it's just like indoors
B	or
A	don't you mean October onwards?
B	after the Halloween
A	Halloween is the thirty-first of October
B	yes I
B	yeah it doesn't make any sense I was thinking in like does that make sense? but no that was my last year cos I no I didn't I did so much I think I did more last summer than I did this summer and I did you know
A	yeah
B	and then I was like yeah I got to about the end of October and November I didn't do anything for like November to about Christmas
A	yeah
B	I think yeah
A	no one
B	yeah
A	wants to go out in the winter it's just too cold and too miserable
B	no
A	and it's just like I could see you or I could sit inside
B	yeah and I can just text you
A	it
B	be like
A	yeah
B	uhu
A	which is okay if you drive I guess but
B	yeah
A	if you've got to get a train and stuff
B	effort
A	it's an effort isn't it?
B	sometimes sometimes it's alright I don't mind it like
A	yeah
B	I've I've booked my driving test for September
A	oh did you? that's cool
B	so fingers crossed we'll see how it erm
A	I dare say it has been dragging on for quite a while now it must have been like you must have been learning to drive for five years
B	on and off I just
A	yeah
B	haven't been like finishing it or but yeah so I think it's probably taken me ages this I I should have booked months ago and then I didn't
A	yeah
B	it's cos I didn't do my theory until about three months ago which I I could have done ages ago like years ago
A	yeah
B	but I never did and then yeah and then you have to wait three months for it to book the test so like
A	oh do you?
B	erm where I live it's a three month waiting list for the test
A	oh I see
B	which is the most annoying
A	how's the driving going?
B	it's fine
A	you
B	I
A	yeah
B	it's just the odd times on on the odd one roundabout but
A	yeah
B	that's about it
A	yeah the the the more you drive
B	especially where I live yeah
A	the more confident you become and you're fine
B	especially where I live loads of people drive very dodgy
A	yeah
B	and he was like
A	it's I think it's cities in general like cities in general are awful
B	it's so bad
A	Birmingham is atrocious to drive round
B	uhu
A	I don't like that at all
B	mm it's got the massive ring road and it's you can get lost can't you in Birmingham? I remember being in erm being in my friend's car in when we went to Leeds in
A	Leeds isn't nice to drive round either
B	we got
A	yeah
B	we went for half an hour and we were just going round in circles
A	yeah
B	for ages and we were only there like we got there about midday no after midday we were leaving in the morning so we just went for a night out
A	yeah
B	and we spent half an hour literally just like
A	driving round and driving
B	driving round
A	yeah
B	and it was like the worst bit I had a good time in Leeds but
A	it's it's always an effort though
B	a big effort
A	sometimes it's easier to get the train to places just because you don't want like you don't have to park
B	yeah cos I yeah that's true cos I know that if er if I do er ever pass I'll never get
A	no
B	because it's just not worth it
A	I would never drive to London and
B	this is it and it depends on the cost and if it costs you more
A	yeah
B	for petrol to put in your car
A	exactly
B	than it does for you
A	yeah
B	get on the train for like that and you can just watch read a book or watch something on your phone
A	it's much more relaxing but
B	I mean saying that I love a good train I spotted the sheep on the way here loads of lambs
A	loads of
B	loads of lambs
A	yeah
B	and I was like oh that's quite nice
A	I do like this side this part of the country because it's quite countrysidy but then you also have quite big cities so
B	uhu
A	or not big cities but like
B	yeah
A	where there's things to do so you're not so secluded
B	uhu which is nice yeah it's like you get
unknown_female	are you all finished?
B	yeah
A	er yes thank you yeah
unknown_female	yeah? did you enjoy it?
A	it was really good thanks
B	thank you
A	but it just it was nice

unknown_female	yeah
A	stuffed my face
B	and my mess you can see my messy

B	like

B	I don't know I think the burger just fell apart
B	in my hand and that's you know I'm making excuses I just can't eat
B	I've never been able to I always made big messes
A	at least you haven't
B	uhu
[ANNOTATION]	Person B is going to dance	Contradiction
A	she just dropped something down her
B	uhu
A	it was just like how do you manage that? like
B	it misses the mouth
A	yeah like
[ANNOTATION]	Person A is feeling so bad about the things that Person C said	Contradiction
B	it's like you go to bite it before it's actually in your mouth and then er you let go
A	yeah
B	that's the you'll
B	when I'm actually concentrating on what I'm doing
A	we went to this erm street food carnival a few weeks ago and erm
[ANNOTATION]	Person A said that they were in that Street a few weeks ago	Entailment
B	oh yeah
A	cos there were so many different types of food that we wanted to
B	uhu
A	try quite a bit so we had we started off with these nice like steam bun things
B	oh was it erm
A	they weren't very big
B	was it them like Chinese steam?
A	er no they were kind of
B	not them
A	they were like erm
A	I think they were more like Greek or something like that
[ANNOTATION]	Person A think they look like Greek	Entailment
B	oh okay
A	they were like they weren't pittas but they were kind of like fluffy pittas
B	oh yeah
A	but and then they were stuffed with I think we had pork belly and it was really nice and they had like all quite saucy and stuff
B	oh yeah
A	and my friend was just looking at me and she had it all down her
A	and she had it all over her hands all the sauce it was everywhere and she was like
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Person B agrees with Person A that she were so messy	Entailment
A	you've not dribbled you've not
B	I don't understand that
A	what the hell?
B	yeah
A	and I was just like
B	you're just a good eater
A	and I was yeah I was just like I wasn't really thinking about it was just you know
[ANNOTATION]	Person A eat a lot	Entailment
A	nibbling away and she was like well I don't understand because I look like I've just like spat it all over me
A	yeah
B	no they're so it's fine I think I did have I already have a mark on these trousers when I left the house and I was like where did that mark like there come from?
A	I was at my parents' house last night and I did all my washing
B	oh yeah?
A	I have a whole car full of washing at the moment
A	which is all nice and clean I just have to iron it when I get home
B	hey at least it'll smell nice on the way back
A	exactly yeah it's like really just got it all done hung out dried I was it was a very productive evening
A	my parents are away as well they're on holiday so it was
B	oh yeah
A	only just me in the house and it was so nice
B	uhu
A	it's just nice to just be on the er be on my own
B	yeah relaxed
A	like it sounds really horrible cos I live with my best friend from school and I love her to pieces but sometimes it's
B	oh did you move in cos I remember you saying last time er cos I haven't seen you for ages
A	yeah yeah
B	and it was like cos I don't think you'd moved I think I can't remember if you'd moved
A	I think I was just about to move in
B	yeah
A	with her or something and
B	and you were thinking like should I do it should I?
A	yeah
B	I think you were thinking about it weren't you?
A	I think so and like we did it and it's fine I don't actually spend that much time with her it's really weird but erm it's er and she went on holiday for a week and it was like so nice and sounds really horrible doesn't it?
B	yeah
A	but it's so nice just to come home and have
B	quietness there's peace and quiet
A	yeah and just be on your own just to be like in the house and just like
B	yeah
A	oh
B	I do miss
A	it's
B	I do miss that at times like when my parents go away like I think when they went they went to India for three weeks
A	yeah
B	in November and my brother was around for the odd weekend cos it was like keep me company but it was just nice I could do I was I can do things quicker
A	yeah
B	like
A	yeah
B	the
A	yeah
B	but when they're around I just can't get stuff done I just feel lazy
A	yeah
B	when they're yeah I feel more lazy when they're around when they're not around just literally go and do what I
A	mm
B	in terms of in the house I'll get
A	yeah
B	I get everything sorted I'll have it in my way
A	it's just space isn't it?
B	like I do I get OCD
A	yeah
B	I get really OCD
A	I did that today actually I cleaned their kitchen for them and then like emptied their fridge out
B	and they come back
A	and binned loads of shit
B	and they're like where has that gone? I was like I've put it oh and they're like
A	yeah
B	where has that gone? erm it's like don't stuff my stuff they're pretty much like you move everything
A	yeah
B	just cos it's good for you doesn't mean it's good for anyone else
A	see my parents
B	and literally
A	are normally quite thankful and they
B	it depends what I I'm quite
A	yeah
B	OCD and erm I'll chuck loads of stuff away
B	and not erm stuff they ever need
A	yeah
B	they're like oh well just keep it like you know extra
A	mm
B	so I put it on the side and be like once you it's a
A	yeah
B	and they're like don't don't don't do it
A	my parents would not be happy if I well my mum would not be happy if I threw stuff away so I normally don't I normally just clean and gut the kitchen to be honest but erm
B	uhu
A	to be in the living room in my pyjamas
B	yeah
A	watching what I wanna watch at my pace not having anybody coming
B	yeah
A	and I just love being alone in a house
B	uhu
A	it fills me with so much joy
B	I think I need to move out
A	yeah
B	one day when I can afford to buy or get a deposit
A	that's the thing I would love to be like have my own flat
B	maybe in a few years
A	it's too expensive
B	yeah
A	and also it makes you feel like quite antisocial if you live on your own
B	yeah
A	but it's really not
B	but I was thinking I was thinking about it like yeah every so often I look at like houses and I'm like oh where would I wanna live? and
A	mm
B	how much would I need for like a mortgage or all that stuff? and like maybe I'll think about it I'll I look for like an hour or two hours and then I'll be like oh and
A	I wish I could save more but I just can't physically can't
B	yeah it's not there is it?
A	no
B	no but
A	mm and then you can have a big house party
B	yeah which would be quite nice cos I like I rarely invite people round like just cos mum you know
A	yeah
B	people are always there and they just don't like people like loud
A	yeah
B	you know
A	especially have you seen
B	nope I haven't last time I saw it was when we went
A	yeah
B	for that meal and that's pretty much it
A	apparently
B	they don't live that far from me or
A	no
B	literally cos I went past I think I was at erm
A	yeah
B	from from work and I was like I'm sure they live in
A	yeah
B	they literally live round the corner I don't I don't think
A	no
B	but
A	and also as much as
B	pretty much
A	stopped talking to you
B	pretty much that's
A	well not you like us
B	yeah
A	stopped talking to us in general
B	which is which is quite sad in a way it's like you should just
A	it's really sad
B	you're still whatever you're doing you still should like
A	make time
B	the people like you spent like a good three four years with you know like
A	yeah
B	most of like most of your
A	yeah like
B	and they were like there at the whole time weren't they?
A	yeah exactly
B	just around the corner or whatever and then it's like yeah
A	and then he gets a girlfriend and then in a moment you just disappear but
B	yeah
A	it's not too bad like I said that to
B	uhu
A	and I said to her I was like you've just got to be careful because I keep inviting you out to things and you're not and you don't come you just sit at home in your bedroom on the phone to
B	yeah
A	and it's dangerous because you will end up with no friends
B	that's true cos then the the the more that you say no doing something the more someone won't er invite you to do it
A	yeah
B	which is the the worst thing and then then you'd be like
A	exactly
B	well why don't they invite me? but if you're with say
A	yeah
B	cos I've seen them when
A	I've seen
B	you get to the
A	her at home so many times
B	when er
A	yeah
B	whatever you do if you get really antisocial
A	yeah
B	you'd miss out and then
A	yeah
A	exactly cos I think she's
B	which is the worst bit
A	it's kind of sad I know cos she's trying to get back in cos I I said to her the other week I was just like you know like I'm trying to invite you to things and you know you just don't wanna get stuck in a rut again and not
B	uhu
A	you know and break up with
B	yeah
A	I couldn't say obviously say it that untactfully but
B	because like once you don't have that one person
A	yeah
B	if you spend all your time doing it's like what do you do when they're not there?
A	exactly like
B	you don't you
A	we
B	you're gonna do nothing or
A	we've lived in
B	uhu
A	but it's quite sad cos like last er this week she was like oh we can hang out on Friday but I'd already made plans to see
B	yeah
B	yeah it's the worst thing is like trying to like
A	yeah
B	oh even if you live with someone it doesn't mean you're always gonna be free when they want
A	exactly
B	to do something
A	and it's kind of like she just expects me to be free and it's like I'm not become so used to you just being in your bedroom that I've gone out and made plans you know like
B	yeah
A	I go out and I see people and I go to the cinema or I go for dinner and you're not a part of that because
B	yeah
A	you don't make yourself part of that

B	that's like the worse thing cos it would be so the most boring thing if you don't know what's going on and really it's like
A	yeah
B	erm shall I laugh for no reason?
A	I mean cos some of his jokes did take me a few seconds to be like ah and then once I got it it was funny

B	yeah there's no point
A	and so
B	carrying on

B	so
A	we're still friends and like we met up last week and we had a coffee and stuff and it's fine
B	uhu
A	and it's quite nice just to be his friend and then
B	it's sometimes better with some people to just be friends cos I find
A	yeah
B	it's just kind of like you get to the
A	well that's the thing
B	that's like kind of where it starts sometimes
A	yeah
B	with for sort of big like
A	we just kind of like go straight into seeing each other instead of like actually getting to know each other
B	oh
A	so we kind of missed the whole friend part
B	uhu
A	so it just there was nothing to build a relationship on
B	oh yeah
A	because there was no friend foundation so it was a bit pointless to be honest but it didn't go anywhere er and then
B	mm
A	it kind of turned me right straight off
B	oh yeah
A	and I was a bit like oh
B	so not it is yeah it's kind of like you don't
A	so at the moment no there's no man in my life
B	something it's summer summer loving

B	but I've always done my own like quite a lot of the time I do my own thing
A	same even when I was dating people I would
B	but
A	still do my own thing

A	I think that's the problem with dating cos people
B	cos then it's that switching off and be like oh yeah
A	yeah
B	I need to make time to do stuff with you
A	exactly
B	and then if you're not free like it kind of if if if they're not free at the same time as you it doesn't work
A	yeah
B	cos then you go weeks and weeks and then like erm yeah it's mm just don't
A	and it's trying to explain to them that you like doing your own thing and then they're like oh so you don't wanna spend time with me? it's like it's not that I just like doing my own thing and going and
B	yeah
A	hanging out with my friends and stuff and then it just feels a bit awkward

A	mm
B	but I think I think it is yeah I
A	but yeah you took one one day off in August and then the the Croatia holiday
B	and that was the only time I took off like
A	I think
B	until
A	you really really need to start using your holiday
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B is entitled 4 weeks of holidays per year.	Neutral
[ANNOTATION]	they took zero days off in August	Contradiction
B	until this year so I took seventy-five percent of my holiday for like F Y fifteen I guess for I dunno a lot of last year's holiday this year so I took I've already taken about fifteen days off this year and that's like until March and then I haven't taken any I took these two days now
A	yeah
B	from since about er mid March then I've got the week off at the end of August and that's it I've got nothing

A	are you not?
B	well
A	is it it was a grand last year wasn't it? it was so expensive
B	it was expensive and I think everyone was like
A	yeah
B	and I know
A	ah
B	and everyone was like erm er maybe twenty-seventeen?
A	it's kind of like
B	it's so expensive
A	a thousand pounds for a holiday is a lot it's a shitload of money
B	yeah like if I was living away from home I would not go
A	no
B	I wouldn't have gone at all none of them but
A	I
B	it's because I was living at home I could technically afford to do it but then it's
A	yeah
B	still a lot of money for
A	cos I just don't
B	like one
A	yeah
B	just for one week it's a lot of money
A	yeah
B	it just makes it
A	I know the idea of spending a thousand pounds on a holiday
B	yeah it's just yeah so I'm not gonna do that in a while but it was good fun like I didn't
A	yeah
B	break any bones and I came back alive and erm
A	a nice group of people to hang out with
B	yeah
A	oh really?
B	so yeah so a few more
A	yeah
B	it was quite good fun just everyone you know
A	yeah
B	a few nights out I just
A	any drama?
B	not really
A	no
B	everyone got on a good few
A	yeah
B	nights out didn't oh no there was the odd argument
A	oh why?
B	oh what was it? erm just someone would just being in a mood the whole time
A	oh
[ANNOTATION]	they talk about drama	Contradiction
B	yeah it was
A	oh shit
B	but they're the best of
A	yeah
B	but at times when she drinks she gets well
A	mm
B	and it just got
A	yeah
B	cos it was just like cos it was the I think it was the day before the last day so everyone like the spirits were like high and like but that was the most interesting
A	the most interesting about the holiday
B	uhu but I just can't
A	yeah
B	stop I can stop my
A	yeah
B	basically I just
A	I'm not very good
B	get ill if I
A	that's why I don't really want to invest a lot of money on a skiing holiday cos I just can't deal with the cold
B	uhu unless it was like a two day like
A	yeah
B	go for like two or three days but I guess I er think cos cos I had to I paid for lessons again cos I had to ski for like four hours a day
A	yeah
B	with an instructor and stuff and for three days or like I was feeling really iffy in the morning but like by about midday once you've had that all like cold day you're you're fine but at the time I just I was feeling so so
A	yeah
B	knackered and then I think there was a day where I didn't have a ski lesson I was like honestly I'm just staying in bed it was all misty and and you couldn't see a thing so
A	yeah
B	if even if I went out I'd literally be like er I don't wanna be
B	going up an edge but some of the views are just to die for though
A	er?
B	the views are to die for and saw them
A	yeah I can imagine I can imagine they'd be
B	like
A	really incredible
B	they were incredible that was probably the best bit is just the views and
A	yeah that's the thing I quite like the views
B	and just and and actually the easy slopes like when you can actually just go really fast like but you know the easy green so it's like you're not really in difficulty of going down just literally just go fast and go straight that is what I enjoyed more
A	yeah
B	I did get lost on my last one
A	yeah
B	I got lost skiing
A	how did you were you just alone? were you not with anybody
A	are you?
A	oh no
B	but basically it was on the last I think it was the last day of skiing
A	yeah
B	and we were all meeting for lunch so everyone was in their little groups and they're like and we we were in like groups of fours
A	yeah
B	around the places and we were meeting up at midday and I think we got to the place early?
A	yeah
B	and there was like four of us erm I literally I think the day before I had just I'd strained my knee
[ANNOTATION]	they didn't know where they were	Entailment
A	yeah
B	and I'd strained my leg so I didn't really wanna do anything hard like literally the effort
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	then we went back up again cos we were still like
A	bit early yeah
B	forty-five minutes yeah so we went back up and they did the three did the blue one but a different blue
A	yeah
B	and I did a different green one
A	oh no
B	and then I went down and then I kind of cos there was like a massive like loads of different
[ANNOTATION]	The others were at the lodge	Neutral
B	and then
A	oh
[ANNOTATION]	the other people were late	Neutral
B	and the one signage
A	dear
B	so there was two for for the same place but one was for the village and one was for the other bit where we were meant to be
A	oh yeah
B	so I started following that and then but I was like yeah I'm not where I want to be
A	oh
B	and like I knew that and then luckily I'd picked up a map like I had happened to have the map the whole
A	yeah
B	week and I picked it I literally had one so I sat like for twenty minutes like I sat down and I was like trying to work out where I was and then realised I was I'd gone down an extra
A	oh
B	so so I was like actually had to get
[ANNOTATION]	the others decided not to go to lunch	Neutral
A	back up
B	erm back up but erm er for some reason the signal on the mountains it's amazing so
A	where are you?
B	where are you? and I was like I'm about ten minutes away
A	yeah
B	I'm not I'm I'm okay I'm I'm alive and then phoned me back like
A	you were quite impressive that you can
[ANNOTATION]	they were going to be late for lunch	Entailment
B	it's
A	that you know that you knew where you were because I can imagine a mountain it's very difficult to navigate where you are
B	and then there's a day cos on a Saturday there's not really that many people on the mountains cos they stay you know
A	yeah
B	so there wasn't actually that many people? and then she called me back again and she was like so where are you? and I was like yeah I've worked out where I am
A	oh no
B	walking back but about an hour later I turned up and they were all waiting for me and they were like
B	and like I said like it was like it was funny at the time
[ANNOTATION]	it was cold outside	Entailment
A	yeah
B	but I don't at least I knew where I was but then I because my knee was so knackered so I went instead of just in green they did like some really hard blue
A	yeah
B	and you just see like the drop and that was like and I I think at one point my ski fell off and then I just shimmied it
A	oh god
B	I shimmied it on my bottom because I couldn't be bothered to put my ski back on and ski and I just like
A	yeah
B	and it's just easier just drag literally like literally go for like
A	yeah
A	shit
B	how far I was and then I had to get all the way back up and I was like hot and sweaty and like this the final day
A	yeah
B	but then I was
B	when I actually got to everyone
A	at least you didn't panic
B	no I
A	yeah
B	and they wouldn't have wasted all that time
A	oh well
B	but that was the most
B	entertaining bit of my holiday
B	but no it was good fun though
A	yeah
B	but yeah not in a while though
A	no
B	another holiday but
A	I don't really have
B	I think any sun
A	holidays in winter
B	that was probably my my first two
A	yeah
B	or
A	yeah
B	then
A	I went to Turkey at the beginning of June and that was really nice
B	was it good? was it good fun?
A	it was really
B	chilled out was it?
A	I went to visit my friend who's Turkish
B	uhu
A	she's invited me over and I was like
B	oh that's
A	yeah okay so I went to see her
B	uhu
A	for a week and that was really nice cos like
B	uhu
A	you know living with like a Turkish family and stuff
B	oh yeah
A	so it was really nice it wasn't just like a tourist
B	but a chilled
A	yeah
B	just like a chilled out
A	yeah
B	that's quite nice and in
A	it was really good
B	yeah I was
A	it was so long ago though it was like two months ago
B	that means you just you're ready for your next trip
A	yes
B	you're ready for it
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a had a bad experience on their last trip	Contradiction
A	I'm ready for Barcelona and then ready for Paris ready for both of them
B	yeah it's pretty much like the same it's like in the next in the next
A	yeah
B	three or four weeks there's
A	it's er three weeks and I'm going to Barcelona and then four weeks I'm going to Paris
B	perfect it's what you need
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a is travelling by plane	Neutral
A	yeah we we go on Thursday so we've got Friday Saturday Sunday then
B	yeah
A	back in work for the Monday Tuesday Wednesday
B	then you get
A	then Paris for the Thursday Friday so
B	well it's yeah it's perfect I think it's a good thing in a way that you just do it all at once
A	yeah
B	cos sometimes you do basically and you get so knackered then you're like I'll give it a few weeks before I go and do something else but
A	it's just how it fell and because of the bank holiday and everything
B	uhu
A	we wanted to use the bank holiday to go somewhere
B	yeah
A	and
B	it's the best way anyway isn't it? so
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b thinks it's a bad idea to travel to Barcelona and Paris	Contradiction
B	no I so you do and I book some time off then be like
A	yeah
B	can we go somewhere?
A	you should so where so you you and your friend haven't actually decided on where you're going at the end of August?
B	well somewhere

A	Spain?
A	Spain yeah
B	yeah like one of the islands like one of the Canary Islands maybe or

[ANNOTATION]	speaker b doesn't want to travel to spain	Contradiction
A	yeah
B	my friend well I texted her on
A	and
B	responded and I should call her
A	cos you can
B	and
A	actually get some okay holidays for like three hundred
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b has a friend they should call	Entailment
B	yeah
A	two hundred and fifty quid three hundred pounds
B	yeah
A	so it's like
B	and it's the thing is the longer you leave it the more expensive it gets at the same time
A	yeah especially in August especially in August
B	and it's that bank holiday it's that last week of of summer holidays
A	yeah
B	technically so it's still a bit like
A	yeah
B	decent in price but she's being yeah I should ring her on the way home or when I get home but she's just being a bit
A	yeah
B	we'll get somewhere
A	need to
B	if not
A	like harass her don't you?
B	me and
A	yeah
B	just go cos we kind of be like you know when you're looking for so long and then if you don't go you in the end you're just gonna be
A	yeah
B	but yeah so we might just go end of just going
A	yeah
B	she's going to V festival for like that weekend
A	oh yeah
B	so she just wants a bit of relaxation for the end of it and I just I can't sit on the beach and do nothing
A	yeah
B	that's my that's why
A	yeah
B	come back so
A	I can't yeah I can't spend a whole holiday on a beach but in Turkey
B	mm
A	you had like
B	I've never done it
A	one day on a beach and then the other days we did some like touristy stuff and then other days
B	uhu
A	we did some walking round the town and
B	oh yeah it's just
A	yeah
B	literally like I'd be like
A	yeah
B	I can't I can't sit here or I'll be trying to find a book and then I'll get bored of the book
A	see I can quite happily sunbathe for a long time
B	uhu
A	but not
B	no
A	I could do it for like a day
B	no it's a long
A	but not a whole week
B	it's a long day I just wanna go
A	yeah
B	and do things and like
A	yeah
B	explore and
A	well exactly cos there's really cos like me me
B	yeah
A	and me and
B	yeah
A	like really late we're arriving at like twelve o'clock at night
B	so pretty much bed
A	yeah
B	or a night and well it depends on what you're gonna do
A	but then we can have the whole Friday the whole Saturday
B	uhu
A	and come back on the Sunday
B	yeah
A	having the whole of Saturday and then coming back on the Sunday
B	wow
A	and it's kind of
B	just literally one day?
A	literally like the one and a half days in Barcelona
A	and it's just like why?
B	that's
A	what's the point?
B	yeah for what one day you really can't do anything like
A	yeah exactly
B	I'm kind of thinking where I've been for one day and literally doing stuff
A	yeah it's really weird
B	well yeah it's I can't
A	they're just going for literally one day and we're me and
B	mm
A	but it's cheaper to fly out on the Thursday night
B	yeah
A	stay for the extra day
B	and you can do more as well
A	and do more cos we're probably
B	yeah
A	gonna be tired but at least then we have like the half like most of Friday the whole of Saturday
B	yeah
A	and half of Sunday
B	uhu
A	and they're like oh yeah we didn't really think about it and we're just like
B	it's yeah cos like
A	yeah
B	get you need at least either two or three days cos erm doing
A	yeah
B	it's like three days would be perfect even two
A	yeah
B	bits and bobs
A	I think it's cos they just they're trying to see so many places they're literally just trying to go as cheap as possible
B	uhu
A	and fly go come back as quickly as possible cos they can't take obviously too much holiday so
B	no but then you miss er you miss the things that
A	yeah
B	you think oh it would have been good to see if I was there
A	but like apparently they're not really into like museums and like
B	they're erm yeah
A	it's kind of good that me and
B	yeah
A	like the more cultural things
B	uhu
A	and then
B	yeah yeah it's the best bit I can remember yeah I just
A	oh yeah the Leaning Tower of Pisa
B	and we were there for about four hours and then well cos there's nothing else there
A	yeah there's just the Tower of the Pisa yeah
B	once that and then we went and I think
A	yeah
A	I would like to go around Italy I've been to Rome and
B	yeah
A	didn't really like it that much and I thought it was really erm
B	yeah
A	messy I thought it was
B	yeah
A	really dirty
B	it was
A	but
B	yeah
A	it would be nice to see that it would be nice to like a tour because obviously the history in Italy is really interesting
B	yeah
A	of all like the different
B	uhu
A	parts like Naples at the bottom and then like Florence
B	and
A	and stuff at the top and
B	and all that kind of stuff it is
A	yeah
B	I think as we didn't spend that much time in that many
A	yeah
B	I think we did
A	I'd like to see Milan
B	it was like I love the I love cathedral
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	all that stuff I'm quite
A	yeah
B	I'm old school like that
A	no no I that's what I agree like when we're going to Paris like
B	it's culture isn't it?
A	so it's
B	uhu
A	erm and I think
B	yeah
A	the big church on the yeah on the hill and
B	uhu
A	Notre Dame and stuff like obviously I've been
B	yeah
A	so many times I've seen it all but it's still
B	I don't think I've ever done Notre Dame or like I've not done Louvre or anything
A	the Louvre
B	Louvre
A	the Louvre
B	the Louvre
A	the Louvre
B	I'm tired
A	the Louvre
B	the Louvre I was I I really wanna go and
A	yeah
B	and we did like three days in like you know the Eifel Tower and the the river the river Seine you know on the boat the cruise kind of thing
A	yeah
B	but that was all kind of about it I need to go back and do like the other side of it the more cultural
A	yeah
B	side of it
A	Paris there's just so many
B	uhu
A	things but it's just nice I love it
B	yeah
A	as a city
B	it's a good
A	so
B	might go next year
A	but it's so easy to get to on the Eurostar now
B	uhu
A	it's so easy and cheap
B	yeah
A	well not cheap as such it depends you can get tickets like
B	mm
A	return tickets for something like seventy pounds
B	yeah I've seen like the odd deals so I'm like I
A	I would just book it I'd just go like for seventy quid? bargain
B	yeah I've like er cos I I'm I'm literally open for anything cos I can just spend what I want on holidays
A	mm
B	really which is really bad like er when other people can't but but that kind of gets me in the mood and I'm like why can't I just spend it?
A	yeah
B	just have that cos I really in such
A	yeah
B	like I'd rather not go on loan but
A	thanks
B	but it and I was like could have taken my mum but then and I thought about that
A	oh yeah my mum's coming with us to Paris and I was like I love my mum but I don't
B	uhu
A	so I'd prefer not to go on holiday with my parents anymore
B	yeah I
A	mm
B	and I'm a person I'm a bit speedy
A	same
B	speedy I wanna get on that train and go there
A	my mum walks so slow it's like go away
B	it just and she's like yeah and that's probably the only thing that I hate if I go and do stuff with my parents like cos I don't really do a lot with my parents even and they were like oh do you wanna go there? it's like mm er
A	yeah I've tried to make more effort
B	probably should do
A	to go for like lunch with my mum or and stuff like that but I don't
B	yeah
A	I wouldn't say that I spend a lot of time with them
B	no
A	I probably should
B	yeah I went for dinner on Thursday with mum and dad
A	yeah
B	when I got back from the bike ride they're like do you wanna come out for dinner? I was like I really don't want to cos I was knackered
A	yeah
B	but at the same time I didn't actually have like I had like a piece of cake for lunch cos we didn't have time to stop it's just like I'm really hungry
A	who did you go to
B	erm
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	so I was like if you're free I'll take one of the days off erm she drove us
A	how how far is
B	it's pretty much hour and a half
A	oh okay
B	which is pretty much you go past
A	oh so it's up yeah yeah
B	so you have to go all the way round
A	yeah
B	pretty much so on the edge of the Peak District
A	so it's not too far actually
B	yeah it's not it's it's not like three and a half hours like
A	yeah
B	an hour and a half literally took us an hour and door to door about an hour and a half
A	I probably even thought it was shorter than an hour and a half
B	uhu
A	yeah
B	like yes I can think it's probably the only way
A	mm
B	didn't really look I didn't really have we didn't really have a satnav either
A	yeah
B	so I had it on my phone and then my phone by the end of it died
A	yeah I can imagine
B	had like ninety percent and it went down to zero and just then she had her Iphone and but we made it so it was fine but
A	yeah
B	it's just like the worst bit like well I didn't really know the and the cos I'd never been down there before
A	up there
B	up there
B	but it was it was good it was a good day trip like it's something a bit different isn't it? I mean I hate doing the same things all the time
A	yeah my best friend who's coming over next next Saturday to
B	oh that's nice
A	to pick me up and we're gonna go to erm he he's really sad he's really old he erm is a member of the National Trust and erm
B	get all the you
A	he wants
B	the
A	yeah
B	one of the guys at work is and it's like it's it's so good because I can get in everywhere for free yeah
A	he gets in so many places for free yeah he really loves it you know having the National it's either English Heritage or National Trust he's part of but erm and he's coming and we're going to go to a place called

A	and a bit away but he's just picking me up and then we'll go and
B	mm

B	yeah it is
A	just to have a look at a new place that you've never been before
B	uhu
A	oh my god my stupid nose
B	yeah and that's annoying me now
A	yeah I know
B	I think if it's a car or something like something like cos I always think it should just go off
A	yeah I dunno what it is I don't know if it's a fire alarm or a or a burglar alarm or whether it's a car alarm
B	well it's probably a it's probably house burglar or
A	yeah
B	alarm
A	it's really annoying whatever it is
B	I know it just hurts my ears
A	yeah
B	and you're just like you can just get
A	yeah
B	and you can just hear it for hours like if I do I just but it is for
A	you try and shut it out don't you? but it just seems to get louder and louder
B	and then it's like oh it's actually not going off though and
A	yeah
B	when it is
A	I wonder why it isn't going off?
B	I dunno I think little there's too many there's too many little flies around I always hate the little diddy ones you know when they just like they go up my nose they go in my mouth
A	and my nose oh fuck off it's hay fever why are you destroying my face today?
B	it's the worst feeling like yesterday I had like
A	yeah
B	it was
A	it hurts to sniff that's the problem it hurts to actually sniff

A	no
B	probably the worst thing being out though so my brother's got it really bad and he literally is like coughs and sneeze the house down and like it's worse indoors than it is outdoors
A	yeah
B	that's what I think it is
A	oh
B	and it's just like he's always got like five packets of tissues with him
