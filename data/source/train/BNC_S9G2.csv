A	there's that tape measure
A	oh it's only half degrees that's not healthy
B	it was about eighteen degrees
A	are you cool? yeah
B	yeah it's just cold air makes me cough yeah
A	have you still got asthma?
B	yeah I do suffer from that only very slightly I went for a cycle ride just the other day Monday I think it was and I did notice in the evening in the evening the cooler the air's cooled down cos the air was affecting me the cold air affects my asthma
A	yeah mine too
B	not hot air cold air does
A	yeah me too I've lived with it for years
B	yeah
A	I'm generally free of it now
B	yeah
A	occasionally when I go for a run
B	don't have too much erm I need to do more exercise but some
A	I just get very tight chested
B	yeah I need to get an exercise bike
A	yeah
B	just watching the programs I can
A	do you have any spare dumbbells?
B	yeah
A	no worries if you don't
B	yes I've got some some weights and a bar
A	yeah I mean anything that I can work out at home with
B	yeah
A	um but like a bit of weight not like a five kilo dumbbell I need like a ten or fifteen
B	I'll see if I've got it
A	yeah I'm a little concerned
B	right
A	it's now what? Thursday?
B	yeah
A	she told me she would message me as soon as she gets there
B	right
A	and they took the midnight ferry
B	right
A	and then there were meant to drive to the spring
B	yes
A	I've haven't heard from her I've emailed her I've emailed his
B	is
A	no he's not bothered he's just like I'm sure they're fine though mum told me that she'd message me
B	yeah
A	I mean they should have arrived how long does it take to drive do you think?
B	well it's it's a bloody long drive
A	six hours through France six hours through Spain?
B	not a chance France is twice the size of the
A	yeah
B	and then Spain is about the same erm you're looking at about erm
A	well they might be able to get some pretty big roads
B	even with the tour roads um you're erm to the Spanish border from here south is probably about eight to nine hundred miles in a straight line
A	yeah
B	then you've got to add the deviation to that
A	it's nearly a thousand miles through just through the length of France
B	yeah that's getting there it's about seven hundred to get into the probably eight hundred by road to get to the south of France erm the erm
A	so what do you think then like a twenty hour journey?
B	oh easy easy twenty hours
A	yeah
B	twenty hours I would say I don't know how far down
A	Barcelona
B	and that took us quite a long time to do that
A	yeah
B	and they're right right down near the Spanish border and they're much they're further south than Barcelona erm I imagine they're I don't know where
A	oh yeah they are
B	there's Costa Brava Costa Del Sol Costa
A	they near to Alicante not too far from there
B	not too far from Alicante? so probably
A	erm Alicante's east coast isn't it? it's
B	yeah
A	it's near to
B	right that sounds like sounds like it could be Costa Del Sol
A	Costa Del Sol
B	erm so it's it's quite a drive I mean personally I wouldn't drive I would fly and hire a car
A	no of course but they looked into flying and it was they said it was a thousand pounds for the three of them to fly and they said no we can't afford that
B	erm I did go with easy easy
A	they said they left the tickets too late too book and then when they went to book they couldn't find it cheaper than a thousand pounds for the three of them so they're driving
B	what's the price of I mean you could have got down to this
A	yeah
B	so things will be
A	yeah
B	for both of us
A	that's abnormally cheap
B	erm yeah prices do pump up I would have probably bought the tickets erm erm further back
A	I mean I told her that I was coming home six months before I came home and she was telling me then that they were going to Spain so why didn't they book their flight then?
B	well um that's why when I responded to your email that I found it a little bit strange that she couldn't have locked into a commitment because she couldn't have booked a holiday at were because you have to book it you can't you can't book into the next year erm officially you have to wait until the new new financial year starts before you can do that so she hadn't booked a holiday erm so and then I did think well I don't think you've paid for your air flights because I was assuming they were going to go down by air now so why is it you can't move it which she did in the end anyway
A	so should I not be worried then? it is possible they wouldn't have gotten there until midnight on Tuesday and then
B	she should yes
A	and then they could have been sleeping all of Wednesday
B	yeah I'd leave it until this afternoon if you haven't heard anything get your brother to ring and see if he gets anything cos they should by this afternoon she should have got her act together erm they got a phone between the lot of them erm to make the call to say yes we're here erm a little drive especially with erm I don't know if your mum was going to take turns but a long drive especially when you consider that erm like in the car is a young child they can sleep for some of that you can't sleep for all of it and it's a question of how much how stimulated he's kept
A	they were silly as well they weren't leaving after a full night's sleep they were leaving after a full day's being awake
B	yes
A	they were leaving at midnight
B	yes
A	which means it seems ridiculous they have to drive another twenty-four hours without sleeping
B	yes yes unfortunately erm I think sometimes they act like um
A	yeah
B	so I went on a drive down there without any sleep we got to
A	yeah
B	especially if I you know you're fifty-one and you haven't had a night you've been asleep
A	yeah it's ridiculous
B	I would have gone in the daytime
A	oh yeah
B	but I'm thinking they're looking at staying a night in France so we'll just carry one in the night erm then sleep for most of the journey
A	I think that was the main reason they wanted to go to sleep
B	yeah
A	selfish but I do wish they'd never had
B	oh it's another uh they will probably especially if they're female they would look at it as though their family was a prototype erm and he's now got a new family now this was the
A	I think the main problem is with their uh now
B	no because he's and it must have been erm it must have been a
B	yes it would have done and the thought that my dad and his new erm wife having another child and then a boy erm she it would have also hurt by proxy his first wife because they had two children together which were daughters she probably wanted a son he probably wanted a son with her I meant it must have been debated on he would have liked to have a boy that never happened he then had another marriage that didn't work and then he had a marriage again and had a child erm
A	no it doesn't
B	the children can feel they will feel this is our family he's related to us but he's part of that new family you know and we're old guard um
A	mum's hurt as well because erm refuses to let her children call mum grandmother so she's not a grandmother at all because they don't call her anything so they don't see her as a grandmother even though she says she puts in as much attention as she can
B	I think she's I think she's right in that sense that yes because
A	yeah
B	uh I agree with yes she should be the grandmother
A	she's growing up with them
B	is is it better to have ten grandmothers or no grandmothers?
A	yeah I only grew up with one grandmother and one grandfather
B	yes exactly
A	I only have one granddad that I don't ever see
B	yes I do agree with her if she puts the effort and she wants to be as well
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a didn't grow up with all their grandparents	Entailment
A	yeah
B	erm so it's yeah that but they shouldn't be surprised about the dismay that his daughters had because um
A	no I don't think they're surprised I think they're just wishing it was
A	but they chose to have
B	well yes but I would imagine
[ANNOTATION]	she is childless	Contradiction
A	it's their choice and they have to live with the consequences of their choice
B	indeed
A	you can't guarantee how people are going to react to it
B	no this this was clearly a they were both on separate agendas they have never actually been honest with each other I doubt if asked a question when she was pregnant together by someone erm what are you hoping the baby will be because they were both operating under different agendas both of them would have come up with the standard stock answer we don't mind as long as it's healthy as long as the baby is healthy which is a true statement but it's not the the full truth he would have been secretly thinking and hoping
A	boy
B	it's a boy and she was wanting a girl one of them was going to be disappointed unless it was twins and was going be one of each
B	yeah so erm so when it she gave birth I don't know if she knew beforehand it was going to be a boy or she was waiting you know to be pleasantly or unpleasantly surprised
A	apparently it's a boy it's a hyperactive little boy like me and apparently he's very similar to if I was that annoying when I was a little boy I'm very sorry
B	I
A	I hear he's like two little boys
B	I haven't spent any time with them I've
A	from waking up to going to bed he has a lot a lot of energy
B	right
A	a lot of energy
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	his energy levels are very low	Contradiction
A	and I guess I was like that too apparently
B	right
A	that is a lot of work
[ANNOTATION]	two people are discussing family relations	Entailment
B	I don't remember you being that bad to be fair
A	no?
B	but I would imagine I'm just trying to
B	it was a case that she knew that she was
A	at that point it's his duty to have a vasectomy
B	yeah
A	had you ever considered that?
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b is infertile right now	Neutral
B	no
A	it sounds horrible
B	yes
B	yeah
A	it looks like a really
B	sounds painful
A	I don't really wanna get it done
B	yeah
A	he's got two kids and he's like no not having any more
B	yeah
A	got it done and
B	I in the end nature took care of itself for me erm
A	yeah
B	so erm
A	no
B	I've got what I want she hasn't got what she wants
A	what did you mean nature took care of itself?
B	er well I won't be erm having any more children because er erm
A	because of her her health?
B	yeah erm
A	yeah okay I didn't know if you were saying you'd become infertile or something
B	we we just no no no no not to my knowledge erm erm we talked about you know years ago we talked about having a child but we just ruled it out with too old
B	too much of an impact on on the er on the existing families
A	surely you don't wanna go through that all again when you've just?
B	er the thought the thought does cross your mind but we er we didn't fantasize about it it didn't it you know erm we
A	you wanna enjoy your your older age
B	exactly so it was talked and then
A	er
B	you
A	stop dreaming you can't do that you're you're
A	your son has only just started school in England
B	yeah
B	French no the erm
A	don't have a job out there
B	no it it's it's a pipe dream it's nice to dream but it I don't I don't
A	dream a dream that's achievable
B	yeah
A	don't dream a dream that you can't manage
B	the
A	that dream that sank
B	yes
A	er when they had
B	yes
A	effectively
B	you you completely
A	they could've done that
B	yes it was completely torpedoed
A	it was feasible
B	yeah the business that he was gonna get into
A	a bike shop or a sandwich shop or something else
B	it wouldn't it would've been a lot of hard work and they wouldn't have have survived
A	no
B	on that erm erm the well they didn't have much capital er you know in the
A	and if they if it if it was that easy everyone would be doing it wouldn't they?
B	yeah and the language you've gotta learn the language erm er I'm I
A	yeah
B	er I wasn't exaggerating cos when I said to the doctor when I saw him to get my
A	yeah
B	erm I would have raised a cynical eyebrow and he goes yes he started to say and then stopped himself but his face continued saying yes I didn't think that this would
B	cos I wasn't I wasn't exaggerating erm she was very she was very very ill she managed to she managed to turn the corner erm the sickness was the fact that the cancer had spread into her bones
A	can she do that again though is the question is it just gonna keep coming back?
B	yeah it's gonna come back so yes I have to be pragmatic and think well beyond and my plan erm if she if she my plan is to hit some of them I'm keeping my options open of moving to Spain or moving to France I will
A	yeah do you have too much family around
B	no no and it's not that far away
A	no
B	and you've got Skype
A	and I mean we'll definitely visit
B	yeah it's not that far away I'm not moving to Korea or something like that it's a quick
A	your two sons both like to travel now so that's not gonna be a trouble for us to come and visit
B	so
A	it will be actually nice I don't have to come back to England when I need a base
B	so it sounds awful but I have to make some kind of plans
A	it doesn't sound awful it sounds pragmatic
B	yeah
A	sounds necessary
B	yeah
A	and both you and I aren't the type of people that think ahead like that
B	yeah
A	as horrible as it is
B	yeah
A	you have to think of these eventualities cos when they happen and they will happen you don't want to be caught off guard
B	no
A	and just spiral out you want to be ready
B	yeah
A	to be prepare for what you're gonna do I don't blame you for thinking about it
B	did
A	uh if you're just going to retire then just get something part time
B	hopefully I'll just do my own thing I'll have my pension and then my state pension will kick in
A	you can come out and visit me whenever I am
B	obviously I'll be more tiny little pension not's going to be brilliant
A	no
B	I also have half the proceeds of the house this will buy me a house or some land
A	yeah
B	and uh some
A	they don't have the can at all
B	no it's actually
B	yeah I um
A	the conkers are really out
B	yes
A	it's definitely
B	yeah
A	I thought August was
B	the house is the mortgage on the house which is due to be re-mortgaged
A	so you will have paid off the house
B	yeah but I don't know what it's worth now but um and the
B	no well that's um she has some savings but she has got some savings she's her parents
A	it's tied up in her parents
B	she's her parents' house is is I think
A	so I mean
B	no they won't they won't anyway erm
A	bothers me I mean not that I expect an inheritance but I don't feel like I'm gonna get any anything
B	you'll get you'll probably get more from my side
A	yeah I'm more likely to get something for you? I've got quite a few friends now that are pretty much set and not just set for a little bit set for hundreds of thousands
B	yeah
A	I know
B	yeah
A	I mean like
B	yeah
A	none none either of us have come from well to do family at all and it was just like the chance of us ever getting property or anything like that in this country
B	yes
A	is impossible therefore
B	the only downside to France I understand is that if your if your house makes money and you sell it you have to pay some of that in tax to the French government
A	yeah
B	you don't do that here but that's the only down downside of that
A	I mean you live your life dad no I don't expect anything to come back through so
B	if there is something there at the end it will be more than my dad left uh
A	sixty quid
B	uh that was a cheque for the state
A	yeah but I'd rather you live out the rest of your life in happy and try to enjoy it as much as possible than uh than try to leave me
A	I'd appreciate it if you managed to
A	he didn't need to he had a trade anyway
B	no no I know you've got to have the trade he's had to learn that
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	but he got it from he knew back here in school he'd always fancied her uh it wasn't reciprocated she was afraid it took a while he started working for family business uh it took a while before their relationship blossomed um and his position erm he rose through the ranks erm in the company there became three partners
A	yeah
B	and the ceiling of that will never be as high as the ceiling as an doctor so
B	so by coming a
B	so by becoming a director of a company with a with about ten to fifteen million pound a year turnover erm he
B	well obviously he's got to pay he's gonna have he's he's got strapped to a mortgage and he's gonna be strapped to another loan for paying buying into the company
A	yeah
B	so he's gonna be paying his
A	but he's eventually saving
B	in the long in the long run
A	yeah
B	so
A	and wait a minute you said he was their son-in-law
B	yes
A	so when you marry someone say I marry
B	yes
A	that will make her my sister
B	no she's recognized as my daughter-in-law that's your wife
A	it's a bit confusing that she's called your daughter and I'm your son
B	yeah
A	so therefore are we not brother and sister
B	yeah yeah I don't know what's that that structure called? it's called a house but what else is it called? begins with B it's a building isn't it?
A	yeah
B	but they're not doing it it's already done you're not really building something are you with me?
A	yeah
B	I'm building a house so what's this type of building when it's complete?
A	because
B	it's part of the English language
A	because building is a non-finite noun
B	yeah
A	that looks like a verb but acts as a noun
B	yeah
A	swimming is fun
B	yeah
A	it's not the actual act of swimming it's a non-finite verb noun
B	yeah yeah
A	a gerund
B	see that's where your your knowledge of the English language is good
B	I'll pick you up about quarter past four make sure your brother's ready erm leave it to this afternoon if you haven't heard from your mum get
A	yeah okay
A	if I could get one more minute
B	oh yeah are you trying to squeeze in another minute?
A	yeah if I could get it to thirty I get paid every ten minutes we're at twenty-nine

B	bin day
A	mum told me the bin day she's all over the place she told me the bin day was Tuesday night put it out Tuesday night so I did
B	yeah
A	and nobody else put their bins out
B	yeah but now it's bin day yeah

B	no not that it's that's called the
A	I've got a bunch of empty boxes and some empty suitcases if I put that there will they take it

A	or do I have to go to some kind of skip or something?
A	it's like a proper suitcases
B	oh alright
A	they're just empty
B	empty boxes
A	they won't take it?
B	erm
