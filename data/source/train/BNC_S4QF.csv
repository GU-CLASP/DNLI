B	we've got a er a postcard from Turkey this morning
C	oh did you?
B	yes
C	from
B	no it was er
C	oh right
B	from er a friend
C	oh I see
B	yes
C	oh right
A	it was your father's really
B	yes
C	oh
B	yes
C	oh right how are they then?
A	he's gone by himself
C	oh right
D	he should be alright then eh? is this
[ANNOTATION]	person A is talking about gone	Entailment
A	no
B	no
D	mm
B	mm
C	mm oh I see
A	it's
C	is it?
B	cos it
D	mm
B	er what was interesting is it took two two weeks to come
C	yes
D	mm
[ANNOTATION]	they believe that it was interesting	Neutral
B	from Turkey yeah
C	yeah
D	yeah
B	and you say it took two weeks to come from Portugal
C	yes that's right yeah mm
B	but obviously Turkey is a lot further away
D	mm
C	why?
A	cos it's one of
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about Turkey	Entailment
C	oh right
D	oh
A	she'll be surprised he sent a postcard she'll say what a tight
D	I like it
C	did he go to
[ANNOTATION]	they are not sure she is surprised or not	Neutral
A	no
C	no
A	no
D	mm
C	mm so how does
A	erm his academic circles and him
[ANNOTATION]	person A is talking about academic circles	Entailment
C	oh I see
A	that sort of thing
C	oh right
C	oh well I know nothing of this
B	used to work at
C	oh did he? right yeah
A	Turkey?
C	yeah
A	or do you mean Greece?
C	oh I mean Greece
A	yeah
C	yeah cos he's changed his mind hasn't he the one who's got in
A	has he?
C	yeah
A	about what?
C	about the debt that they owe
A	oh right oh that's strange isn't it?
C	mm
A	well do
C	yeah you know
A	oh right
C	yeah that's erm
B	I think
C	a bit
A	mm
C	mm
B	it is possibly a little bit self-imposed in a way because if they'd collected ten years' worth of tax revenues
C	mm
B	like they should have collected
C	yeah
B	it would hardly have any debt at all
C	yes
A	mm
C	you know on council estates
A	yeah they just mm
C	and they don't collect the erm
A	oh right
B	the the thing is whether it's local government or national government it has got to be run as a business you know
D	absolutely
B	have to get your funds and get money in in order to pay for all the services
C	of course you have yeah
C	yes
B	delivering
C	now erm er years ago when I went about
A	mm
C	said well no you can't because you already owe two years
A	yes
C	back
A	it would never come right
C	that's before
C	that's before this
A	yes
C	how many months
A	mm
C	so no it it just won't do but
A	mm
C	if that's if they've got fifty P
A	mm
C	to spare what what are they gonna do? I don't know they can't say you're gonna have to erm pay ten pound a week because they'd say well we don't have it
A	well no
C	so I I don't know how it goes on
D	but the thing is what's
C	I think council tax and rent should be taken off
A	you put it first yes
C	off any they usually
D	benefits
C	got
A	on benefits mm
C	mm yeah
A	mm
C	benefits or unemployment or
A	mm
C	something it should be taken first
A	mm
D	but there may be a law
C	you can't do that
D	where you can't do that
C	no
D	mm
A	mm
D	mm
B	the er Competition Markets Authority has er
C	mm
B	in regard to Richard Branson operating the East Coast Main Line
D	has he?
A	oh right
B	yes
D	mm
B	er problems are that there would be insufficient competition between erm Grantham and Newark and Edinburgh to Dundee because there would be er too much of the services would be run by
D	by Branson
B	Stagecoach are Virgin and its companies because between Newark and Grantham the only other sort of competition is East Midlands Trains which is also which is a Stagecoach company
A	oh right
B	and erm between Edinburgh and Dundee a significant amount of the services are run by Scottish Citylink coach service which is also Stagecoach
D	yes
B	so they've got a week to er suggest how such issues can be remedied
D	hey when you think about that run
B	yes
D	it's not all that great is it?
A	is it the next stop?
D	more or less
D	there's not much in it
B	mm
D	and so you know they've got all that run and then just
A	that bit
D	a little bit in the middle
A	no no no
D	no
A	what about Edinburgh to Dundee is that a long
B	that is a
A	piece?
B	very good stretch
D	yeah
A	yes
D	that that would be a bit longer wouldn't it? but nevertheless
C	so there isn't enough competition is that what they're saying?
B	they're saying that
A	yeah
B	well currently it's the East Coast is held by the state so the issue of competition doesn't exist because
C	no
B	the state doesn't compete with itself
C	no
B	but because it will be operated by Stagecoach and Virgin
C	yeah
B	there's they the Competition and Markets Authority doesn't think there'll be enough competition between those routes because I think about nearly eighty or ninety percent of the services would be operated by them which then puts them in a position to either increase their prices
C	yeah
B	or reduce their service frequencies
D	mm
B	which would not be in the interests of the traveller
A	mm true
C	mm well I don't understand
A	I don't know why they have to sell it anyway really
D	I don't
C	no
A	it seemed to be going on alright
D	yeah I mean to be honest I would have er like British Railways back again
B	mm
A	it wasn't popular at the time but
D	no it's not popular or let me put it this way you'd think it's not popular
A	mm
D	because you've got like the
A	mm
D	like the media
A	mm
D	type of thing start niggling away at it
A	mm
D	you know making
A	comments about the sandwiches
D	or the sausage rolls even
A	yeah
D	yes it's that type of thing
A	mm
D	exactly that and
A	mm
D	and er and there is because it's
A	mm
D	for example don't forget when I first started work it was a private company
A	mm
D	with shareholders
A	mm
D	and it was called
A	mm
D	and we used to have directors' visits once maybe twice a year
A	mm
D	or certainly once a year when everything had to go and be cleaned up and that
A	mm
D	and it was run to er er a profit for the shareholders
A	mm
D	now then it became nationalised
A	mm
D	no shareholders really
A	no
D	and
A	mm
D	er
A	mm
D	cos it's government money
A	yes
D	and things were better
A	better equipped
D	really
A	mm
D	mm but because it's er government money
C	the surgery
D	surgery type of thing it was a
C	clinic a clinic
D	a clinic mm like an antenatal clinic and that
A	mm
D	type of thing and this has got something like you know ten thousand grand to spend there
A	mm
D	and he said I can't see really what we want
A	no
D	he said I thought I'd done well saying right get rid of all the chairs we'll have some new ones
A	yeah
D	but you see it's nowhere near covered it
A	mm
D	you see they've got the money
A	mm
D	but what
A	what to do with the money
D	do we do with it now?
A	mm
C	and then if they don't spend it
D	you if they don't
C	this year they don't get it next year
D	spend they won't get it next year
A	yeah
D	and so you know that's that's the way
C	mm
D	er sort of government
A	mm
D	they've got the grants and they've got to spend it now and er now then when it became a national bus company there was we had all sorts of things you know some big some small of er things happened
A	mm
D	to
A	mm
D	so some of it of
A	mm
D	like that going on and er but there wasn't much more er equipment and that came in then
A	mm
D	but it's all been paid for by government all the best equipment
C	mm
D	and this is how it goes
A	mm
D	corporation money public funding
A	yeah it doesn't matter so much
D	yeah it don't matter nobody seems to be accountable for it
A	no
B	in the in the railways erm the funding is actually more now even accounting with inflation than the days of British Rail
D	is it?
B	it's more expensive by about
D	mm
B	nearly twice as much
D	yeah but the thing is
B	and we haven't really got any massive projects I mean if you think about nineteen ninety-one nineteen ninety-two the whole of the East Coast Main Line was electrified
A	yeah
B	it was a big project and we hadn't
B	really seen anything like that
D	mm
C	no
D	but now isn't it split up? there's the Network Rail they look after the track and all that business
B	yes
A	yeah
D	and somebody else looks after the
A	trains rolling stock
D	you know so the it
B	it's very complicated yes
D	it is this is it and in all that
A	separated
D	complication
B	mm
D	there'll be a lot of money transferring and
B	yeah
D	floating about and
C	oh it is
B	I mean Network Rail you could just about say that that is the government
C	right
B	but they the companies who run the trains are
D	on the rails like Virgin
B	yeah and First and Stagecoach and
D	mm
B	quite a significant amount of those are also stakes of different countries
A	mm
B	erm
D	mm
C	mm
B	for example Arriva is owned by the German state it's
D	yeah
C	is it?
B	part of Deutsche Bahn
D	I was just gonna say
B	it's er that's our business that really the various er in our but it looks as though that is going to be
D	sold off yeah
B	yeah
D	to whom? French?
B	there's lots of bidders in at the moment they haven't chosen anybody yet but we've got a Singapore asset firm erm we've got erm who else have we got? we've got
D	oh yeah
B	which was owned by the French state
B	we've got one which is a bit surprising is the erm I think it was the
B	Nottinghamshire pension fund for er the state workers of Nottingham
D	was it really?
B	really
D	Nottingham
B	erm we've got I think Prudential in line with a a pension show have put in a
A	mm
B	erm
D	so some of these
B	mm
D	come into purchase it?
A	well they just don't do any bids at the moment
B	yeah
C	mm
B	yeah
C	mm
B	but they plan and the
C	mm so in the end would it be one
B	yes it would
C	oh
B	just one bidder will win which
C	yeah
D	mm
B	I mean some have put a giant bid in
C	yeah
B	erm
C	yeah so why are we selling it then?
B	it's allegedly to help the deficit but the amount of money it will raise is not going to put
D	no
B	it's hardly a dent er I think it brings it down from about eighteen point four trillion to eighteen point two or something like that so
C	mm yeah
D	that's for selling that off then
B	no it's not
D	mm
B	much money I think
C	mm
B	some kind of ideology that it being privately owned is the best way about it
C	I would have thought it was an asset wouldn't you
A	mm
D	like the silver it's
A	well yeah I
C	yes
B	it's a national
C	yes
B	asset
D	mm the family silver
C	yeah
A	I think we should keep full control
C	yeah
B	we own erm forty percent is it
C	oh do they? right
B	yes
D	but it goes to their
C	yes
D	that that
C	yes it goes to the
D	obviously countries and Belgium as well
C	that's right yeah
D	mm
C	no I
B	another thing is
A	mm
B	even if we were going to sell it now is not the time to sell it because they're going to get they'll have have ordered and I think next year some new trains will be coming with the intention to do new routes to Amsterdam and Frankfurt and er Geneva so obviously that's going to be a new venture
C	a source of income isn't it? yeah
B	and obviously it's a new stream of income
C	yeah
A	mm
B	that all being well will
D	mm
B	add to the value of the firm so my concern is is that the firm's value will rise in the next five to ten years
C	mm
B	significantly because of that
C	mm
D	well people do travel more don't they?
A	mm
C	yes
D	mm
C	well it's a good a good way of travelling isn't it on that?
A	yes I think so
B	I think
D	and
B	they have er got a bit of an issue with expansion largely due to the sort of the passport issue that er passengers must have their passport checked at the station so the train has to be at a sealed platform and obviously
C	mm
B	that's creates a bit of a problem
D	yeah
B	for er creating new routes so it's kind of limited its expansion a bit and it looks as though that these new routes everyone will have to get off at Lille to go through security
D	mm
C	oh
D	cos at the airport
C	mm
D	you go you know out of one area more or less into a gift shop but you can't go back once you're through there
A	no mm
B	mm
D	and then you go through for the plane don't you?
A	yeah you're like in a no-man's-land really
D	yes you you're
B	yes
D	stuck there mm well it'll have to be like that at at the train then wouldn't it?
A	mm
D	that's what you're saying it's security has to come into it mm
B	yes
D	but you see this the ideology of of what you're saying there
A	mm yeah
D	you know and really er the politics is is you've got er well like sort of conservative type politics on one hand and at the other end you've got these er republicans and that who you know do away with this and do oh dear oh dear
A	mm
D	instead of really people should decide what they want to do and then go to that country like if you want to be a republican go to Ireland that's a republic
A	mm
D	or wherever
C	mm
D	er but don't start disturbing it here
A	it never happens like that though does it?
D	no no
A	they try and change
D	yeah
A	what there is
D	they change it here
C	mm
D	mm
B	it's a
C	mm
B	you know it's
D	mm
B	money that it the government doesn't have to do very much to get it
D	no
A	no
B	and
D	no
B	obviously if they they see it is an asset that's bringing money in it can help pay for other things like the NHS and that type of thing
C	mm
A	over the one
B	and then attempt to not to really have to sort of increase taxes is er
C	mm
B	the bottom line really
D	but you see they've paid for the up getting it up and running
B	mm
D	all the infrastructure
B	yes
A	mm
D	all the admin that it takes
A	mm
D	er and that and then somebody else is gonna get the benefit of it all
A	let it go yeah
B	yeah
D	and I would say
A	yeah
D	that the Eurostar is more popular than er who is it? Agatha Christie's er
A	Murder on the Orient Express
D	Orient Express yeah to Vienna
B	mm
D	I would say it's just as er
A	successful
D	desirable to travel
A	mm
D	on Eurostar as Orient Express
A	mm
B	mm one thing that does have to be taken into consideration is because the French state is the majority
C	mm
B	holder that it has fifty percent that it is allowed to charge a premium on top of the price agreed for the forty percent stake of the UK government
A	mm
B	IE it's able to charge a sixteen percent surcharge
C	on the fares?
B	on the no I mean the amount the firm pays for the UK government's stake
C	oh right yeah
B	the French state can
C	oh
B	charge a sixteen percent er
C	yeah
B	supplement on top
A	oh right
B	of that because it's a majority shareholder
C	oh I see so who's paying for all these new er carriages and all in this?
B	it will be split between the
C	two oh
B	the three governments
C	the three yeah
B	yeah
C	mm
B	mm
C	mm
B	and
C	well I should
B	yes
D	mm oh yeah
B	it's
D	mm
B	and it's the
C	yeah a few million
B	it's be a few million it's
A	yeah
B	be about about ten million pounds per set yeah
C	mm
D	when we're talking about infrastructure well you're talking about some towns and some stations they're having to enlarge
A	mm
D	you know
C	mm
D	make it longer
A	mm the platform
D	this the platform
C	yes
A	for the length of the train
D	for
C	yeah yeah
D	the train to match the train
A	mm
D	you know it's not er it's not just putting a couple of more
C	mm
B	but even ordering those new trains has created a big
D	mm
C	really?
B	because the tendering process was done the UK way and not the French way
C	oh
B	er when it's done the UK way you sort of invite everybody to
C	yeah
B	put in a bid and they eventually awarded Siemens of Germany to build them
C	I was just gonna say
B	but the
C	that they got it
B	the French way of doing it is to hand it over to a French company
D	mm
B	erm which is would be Alstom of France so er Alstom launched a lawsuit against it
C	yeah I don't blame them either
B	because Siemens won the contract but
C	yeah
B	they didn't get anywhere with it
C	they've still got it have they?
B	they've still got it yes
C	yeah
B	so
D	see they're all looking at self-interest aren't they?
A	mm
C	mm
D	except
A	England
D	us really
A	we're hopeless really awful
D	yeah
A	mm
B	well I think the East Coast has done very well erm if you think the last two companies that ran it have ran into administration and the this they have managed to extract made some money from the line
C	mm
A	mm
C	I think it's an amazing thing don't you?
A	mm
D	it's certainly
A	mm
A	it's good isn't it?
D	mm
C	well I think it's like science fiction really going under the
A	mm
C	sea really
B	yeah
A	it's better than flying really I feel more comfortable
D	yes
A	don't you?
D	mm
A	more
D	yeah
A	relaxed about it
C	mm
D	yeah it is it's er
A	mm
C	mm I like train journeys don't you?
A	mm
D	well we were
C	not
A	no
D	we were saying coming when we was coming there er our
A	mm
D	to where
C	mm
D	I don't know what time they were setting off like
A	mm
D	er but er the they're going to Spain again
A	mm
D	Benidorm that's it Benidorm
A	mm
D	and er
A	it starts about two days before the packing
D	well even with that
C	mm
D	she'll have been up about three o'clock this morning
A	mm
D	to get to Leeds get
A	mm
D	the er
C	yeah yeah
B	it's it's driver who was gonna take them it's his son isn't it? he's gonna take them to erm
A	mm
B	Leeds Bradford
C	it's either
A	mm
A	mm
D	er there then you've got to be at the airport maybe two hours beforehand
A	mm
D	isn't it? and then
A	mm
D	so two hours in and then when you get there usually our experience is you get on another coach
A	mm
D	which will run round to different hotels
A	yeah dropping
D	dropping you off
A	yeah
A	and your
D	and if you're in the last one the last hotel
A	you're absolutely exhausted
D	that's another two hours really
A	when you get there you
D	mm
A	stagger in and want to lie down and
D	mm
B	that is one good thing about rail is that it takes you bang on in the centre doesn't it?
C	yes
B	mm
D	mm
C	mm
D	well this is it you see this is what we were saying about what we was comparing it really with national holidays we get a taxi at our house
A	possibly I don't
C	oh
B	yes
D	he drops us off at
A	yeah
D	do we?
C	no that that's in England isn't it mainly
D	well he when
C	well we have been in Italy haven't we?
D	yeah even when we did Italy that
C	and France yeah
D	mm even when
A	mm
D	where we got out we just wanted our overnight bag they said pack an overnight bag for Metz you know we'd we're stopping there
A	mm
D	and er and then the next day was
A	mm
D	wherever wasn't it?
A	yeah
D	but the train it definitely the best travel
A	mm
B	mm
A	I think so
D	you know so long as the proviso you're facing the right way
C	oh right that's right isn't it yeah
C	some people
B	and you've reserved a seat
C	make a fuss about it don't they?
A	mm
D	mm
A	or you've got a
C	that
A	kind person with you who will swap with you
D	yes
C	yes
D	that's another thing
D	yeah
C	yes
B	I have looked at doing Italy via rail but er it's just a little bit too far to do from
D	mm
B	in one day
A	oh right
D	er to Italy by train?
B	erm
C	yeah
B	in one day
D	yes I would say so mm er what going into what Rome or something? or
B	it would be well if you catch the first Eurostar of the day which is five forty from London or six twenty-eight from Ashford
D	I'll listen to this back
B	erm you could be er in Milan for or at five o'clock in the evening
A	oh
D	Milan mm mind you
C	well we
B	and it would be
C	we went to Spain didn't we?
B	efficient
C	we did Spain didn't we?
B	yes
D	by train
C	yes
D	well they they had this er they called it the Golden Rail
C	mm
D	we got a Golden Rail ticket didn't we?
C	yeah
D	mm and we was met weren't we?
C	mm
[ANNOTATION]	The speakers possess Golden Rail tickets.	Entailment
D	they saw our luggage with the markings on like and they came er company
C	mm
D	er one night in Paris
C	mm
B	mm
D	went across
C	mm
D	we got to Paris about what? seven in the morning?
C	mm
D	and I went we had our breakfast there didn't we?
D	er I went to get shaved and I said to this er like where can I get shaved and that? in there like so I go in there and just get started
D	so I go back and making enquiries again and it's no no no no er in there in there and so I carried on shaving
A	English boys are not used to that sort of thing
C	no
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker D was looking for a place to get shaved.	Entailment
D	absolutely not
D	not having my private shaving as well
D	that wasn't
C	yeah
B	a very good shave
C	no
A	it wasn't no
[ANNOTATION]	The shaving was not really good.	Entailment
D	you know the nervous
A	rushed
C	yeah
D	tension was there wasn't it?
C	yeah
C	well we we decided we'd have a an English breakfast
A	mm
C	er and you paid extra
A	yes
[ANNOTATION]	The breakfast speaker A had wan not a French one.	Entailment
C	so erm okay we when it came it was
A	they didn't know how to do it yeah
C	I think they'd put the bacon in and
D	pulled it out again
C	turned it over
A	yeah
C	and that
[ANNOTATION]	Someone's skills in cooking were not the best.	Entailment
D	it was
C	was that
A	virtually raw
C	it was awful wasn't it?
B	it would have been
C	we would have been better off with a
[ANNOTATION]	The bacon wasn't cooked properly.	Entailment
A	other yeah
C	with the er
A	a croissant
B	a croissant
C	croissants yeah
C	but yeah and I said
D	but
C	your dad says oh well we'll have a good breakfast and then
A	yes it'll last
C	you know it er will last us a bit so but we didn't
B	you can definitely do
C	can you?
B	yes
C	oh right
B	er it's five hours to
A	five is that true?
B	Barcelona from Paris yes
A	oh right
B	by train yeah
D	well that that's not too bad is it really?
C	no
D	well it's better than getting up at I don't know
B	erm well I think they do five trains a day cos it been doing five trains a day from Paris so
D	really? cor
B	er if you've got the first train of the day at
C	yes
B	er and say you could get into Barcelona in the same day
D	mm
A	mm
D	oh and er
C	that might be an option
D	who who's running that? is that
B	it's you just kind of
D	like a travel company?
B	erm as like a travel company
D	mm
B	it will be that you just book a a a normal train service between
D	mm
C	mm
D	maybe the Golden Rail ticket coming back
C	yes
C	it was a long time ago
B	yes
D	yeah
B	I mean luckily all international tickets are covered by the
B	which means that if your train is late erm you will be transferred to the next one or put up in a hotel
D	mm
A	oh right
B	erm until
C	yeah
B	you can travel
C	mm
B	if your
C	mm mm
B	till you eventually get there
C	mm
B	mm mm
A	mm
B	mm
C	well it might be better than going by plane you know for a trip isn't it?
D	well there'll be there'll be similar from
C	yeah
D	anyway it's from
C	yeah
D	mind you you see the thing is
C	yeah
D	and York is a hub
C	yeah
D	railway isn't it?
C	well we would go to York wouldn't we?
D	we'd probably go to York yes
C	yeah
D	from
B	there is a six
D	mm

D	new buildings weren't they? you don't think of these places like that do you?

D	I mean to be honest
A	mm
D	year of culture and you
C	mm
D	and you'd think of
A	so rise to the challenge
D	mm
C	mm
D	I think that like
A	well there are some nice places like the
C	mm
A	city hall and
C	yes but I don't they do
D	yeah but very basic
A	they don't do nice new buildings or er
D	no
A	when they do new buildings

A	I'm never inspired by
D	the er
A	I don't like it
A	oh wow
D	er refurbishment

D	well I
C	use it
D	like to know
C	or
D	if I need a
D	I mean if I have to be nipped into hospital
C	I see we a a different erm
C	a sort of attitude with
A	mm mm
C	there was your work things which
A	mm
C	you had and then you had what you call your night clothes
D	yes
C	you know to go out to the cinema or
A	oh right
C	whatever
A	yeah
C	and then you had your
A	evening clothes
C	best clothes
A	yeah

C	or your best suit
A	yeah
C	which is used for weddings and funerals
A	yes
C	and
A	church and things
C	parties or church
A	yes mm
[ANNOTATION]	The best suit is total black.	Neutral
C	so but you wouldn't
D	mm
C	think of putting your best suit on
A	no
C	midweek
A	definitely not
[ANNOTATION]	Wearing suit on weekdays doesn't sound like a good idea.	Entailment
D	no
C	so
A	quite wrong
D	well I but you see
B	erm
D	it was the way of the world in those days
C	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	People in the past used to think in a more conservative way.	Neutral
C	yeah
D	you know everyone was the same and
C	yeah
B	yes
D	and er
C	you even had your best shoes and that didn't you?
D	mm
A	mm
B	I think I've erm sourced a erm a new pyjama manufacturer
C	oh right where's that then?
B	erm there's this company erm producing tall pyjamas
[ANNOTATION]	The new pyjama brand is for fat people.	Contradiction
C	oh right yes
B	that are made in this country
C	oh wow yes
B	so I'll be
C	that's unusual
A	mm
B	it is
C	it's usually America isn't it?
[ANNOTATION]	This type of production is not rare in the country.	Contradiction
A	yeah
C	or somewhere
B	mm
A	it has been
C	mm
[ANNOTATION]	In America, pyjamas for very tall people are made.	Neutral
B	well they're usually sold in America and made in
D	mm
C	yeah
B	but these ones are made in the UK and
C	oh
B	sold in the UK
C	mm is this on the net?
B	yes
C	oh right
D	mm
C	yeah
B	well their pyjamas are thirty-six
C	oh
B	it's a good length
C	mm
B	considering how they're usually thirty-four and I'd like so
C	yeah
D	you may have to cut a bit off then
A	just put turn-ups on
C	yeah
A	mm
D	turn-ups yeah
C	mm
D	mm
B	well I suppose it depends where you wear them really
A	mm
C	yes
D	yeah
A	mm
D	I'll tell you for why
A	if they shrink in the wash
D	when
A	mm mm
D	she's always ahead of me
D	when they go through the wash you know they'll shrink a bit then you can take them out
A	and let them down
D	just be the right size
A	they'll be perfect mm
C	the wash gets blamed for a lot of things
C	doesn't it
A	yes other than that you could always put braces on you see just to lift them an inch
A	like that
D	but
B	so er looking forward to trying those at some point
A	mm and what erm patterns can you get?
B	mm they've got some nice er sort of tartan patterns
A	mm
B	you know the sort of
D	tartan?
C	yeah
B	that one usually gets
A	yeah yeah he likes a nice tartan
B	sort of red or blue tartan they do
A	mm nice
B	and most
D	I have two very nice dressing gowns though
B	mm
C	mm yeah
A	what unused?
C	no
D	mm?
C	no he does wear one
C	he does wear one
D	yeah one I don't wear the other one much do I?
C	no
D	have I ever worn it?
C	which one is this?
D	there are two they're very similar actually
C	yes
D	mm
C	don't know there's one you use isn't there?
D	well I had to do this
D	hospital for a this check or something I had to have a dressing gown and mine wasn't very good so I had mum's on
C	yeah
A	a likely tale
D	well that's what
A	they all say that don't
C	they were a bit worried about you
D	yeah we've heard that before
A	mm
A	mm
D	mm
C	how's your hand now
A	yeah it's much better now
A	no it's that one
C	yeah yeah well it's a lot better than it was
A	yeah yeah
C	it's er
A	mm
C	whether there's anything
C	mm
A	you do get your hands wet quite a lot
C	oh yes
A	peeling vegetables and
C	when you think of well you know washing up and you can
A	yeah
C	mind you do you still
A	yes yes
C	yes
A	I think just
C	yes
A	mm
D	how is the window holding up
B	it's
D	yes
B	but the other side seems to have started off now
D	oh I see
B	yeah it's not as bad as it used to be but
D	yeah the same again
B	but the good thing is that side looks as though it's sorted I think I've done it
D	mm
B	cos there was quite a bit of work to do on that side when you think that there was the curtain rail to do which was
D	yeah
B	no easy job
D	no no they're not are they curtain rails no yeah I've been dealing with curtain rails this week as well
A	mm
B	mm?
D	mm
A	mm
D	yes I've dealt with curtain rails this week twice actually
B	you
A	oh
B	modification
B	modification yes
A	what's that?
D	we're still having one rail
A	mm
B	uhu
D	and there is a central fastening
B	yes
A	mm
D	and it's the two rails goes into that
A	yeah
D	I'm going to get another central bracket so we can just lap them like that a bit
B	mm
A	yeah
B	yes
D	mm
A	like when you have the strings they're
C	mm
A	like that aren't they?
C	mm
D	yes
A	so it crosses over slightly
D	yeah or
C	mm
D	or by that bit
C	mm
A	mm
B	yeah I was so pleased that erm it could use the existing fittings
A	I know
C	mm
B	you know I didn't have to drill anything I er so
A	I thought I felt sure
B	it's safe
A	we would
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about a film	Contradiction
C	oh yes
A	but nothing ever is the right size
D	no
C	no
A	or compatible
D	because I believe that there would be like the plasterboard
A	mm
B	mm
D	and you would have to use er butterfly nuts
B	yes
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about nuts	Entailment
A	mm
C	and it makes a big hole doesn't it?
D	are you with me on butterfly nuts? have I showed you butterfly nuts?
C	yes
B	they're like a little plastic
A	do you mean Rawlplugs? that's Rawlplugs on here
D	that's a
B	uhu
D	and there's a a longish ball goes through and you screw it through which means you've got to put the bolt through first
B	uhu
D	through what you're going to fasten and then screw the butterfly on just to start it
B	mm
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about butterfly	Entailment
D	and you need a hole big enough big enough when it's closed up to go in so it would just be this elongated
B	yeah
D	you put it in and let it go and it opens up and you can now screw away to your heart's content
B	mm
D	because you only use it once because when you wanna do it
B	mm
D	that drops
B	yes
D	but I shall have to er
A	demonstrate
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about school	Contradiction
D	I'll bring to couple
B	yes
D	er but for er
A	curtain rails
D	well really
A	I hate curtain rails
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about book	Contradiction
D	for er plasterboard fastening
A	mm flimsy walls
D	mm I mean don't forget the plasterboard is on wood as well
A	mm
D	so if you was lucky and you hit the wood
A	yes it would be better wouldn't it?
[ANNOTATION]	they are not sure about plasterboard is on wood	Neutral
D	yeah you could have a screw in but that rarely happens does it?
A	mainly you don't
B	mm
D	it would just be an inch out or something or or
B	I must say
D	mm
C	mm
A	should be a bit stronger shouldn't it?
C	yes
D	that's it
A	yeah
D	mm well there's some wonderful fixings and tools that out now isn't there?
B	there's
A	mm
D	really
B	some?
D	fixings
B	fittings?
D	really good fixings
B	yes
D	you know to like these
B	mm mm yes
B	I do quite well to be honest but
A	done some good jobs haven't you?
B	yeah
A	mm
D	well I like those er this screwdriver set that much that when I got home and weighed it up
A	no you wanted a
D	I am going to get one
A	mm
D	yes I'm going to get one
C	yes
B	what I was thinking of doing is er I've got a little tray in the garage and I'm thinking of putting all the essential tools in there and keeping that in the house and attempt to
D	mm
B	er sort of
D	I know
B	tools
D	mm
A	mm
D	I mean by the way
B	yes
D	there's a magnet there as well
B	a magnet?
D	yes and I think it's you know when you're cutting the bits off and that?
B	yes
D	er you know
A	mm
B	yeah
D	or it gets mixed
B	yes
A	mm
D	you see so you just have to watch
A	you kind of do with a little tin to put them in
D	mm
A	otherwise they'll be all over the
C	mm
A	mm
D	well actually I said really if I had time I'd knock a box up you know a wooden box
B	uhu
D	and
B	yeah
D	and to lay them in there because the big danger is you get them all mixed up
B	mm
A	with what? other
B	well you might put
D	in within that set as well
A	oh right
D	and any others anyhow mm
B	a T twenty screw in the T twenty-five
A	slot
C	mm
B	slot and then
C	mm
A	oh how can you
B	using it to
A	get it to stay on the thing?
D	mm
C	I don't know
B	well it might do or you may need to get
D	I think I think they are in a little clip actually
B	yes
D	of course they're still in that bubble pack
A	yeah
D	but when I went into er
D	the correct name is
A	yeah
C	mm
D	er there was er er these two like and and another so I said I'll tell you what I'm after and I said haven't heard of it have you a T twenty screwdriver? it I'm calling it that
A	mm
D	says yes I says no well I've heard of Phillips
A	mm
D	and Pozidrive and slots but T twenty and the other bloke said I have he said and he says I think they're doing it on purpose so as you can't do things
A	yeah
D	because you need these
A	it
D	you
A	yeah
D	you know bits and pieces
A	mm
D	like and that and so the other one says right follow me and away we went round up and there there they are like and it's there
C	have they?
D	and I don't know whether the screwdriver's a ratchet as well
B	I would suspect
A	mm
B	it is yes
D	mm and then when I looked at it it
B	mm
A	mm
D	and I counted up I think you counted as well didn't you
C	mm
D	anyway and said there isn't forty-
A	mm
D	itself I said that's another one like
B	mm
A	mm
B	mm
A	mm
D	I said another I don't know must be about five or six there and then it said magnets
A	mm
D	don't forget magnets keep away from laptops and
A	telephones and things yeah
D	computers and er even maybe mobile phones and that magnets and televisions now they don't go
A	mm
D	but er yes I think the magnet is to when you've got them out you know just put it on or if you're gonna pick them up
B	mm
A	they might be
D	may be marked
A	engraved on the side
D	mm
C	mm
A	so you can see
D	mm
A	which is
D	I don't know but of course when you look at the end you can
A	mm
D	they're to keep together and I think the Phillips and the cross like the cross one it's just a flat one ordinary
A	mm
D	down there and there's the the Pozidrive well the Pozidrive and the Phillips they're similar but you'd soon find out
A	mm
D	yeah
C	mm
A	that's why those little thirty-five mil canisters used to be handy didn't they for putting little bits and pieces in
D	absolutely mm
A	in your sewing box et cetera or
D	mm mm
A	little
D	and
A	bits
D	a broken tooth or something
A	if we have one
D	mm
B	mm
A	mm
D	mm mm
A	well yeah
D	well you can still get it like
A	yes
D	would have gone out
A	well hardly mm
C	mm
D	cos you have it's all on the
[ANNOTATION]	they don't have any more time to get it	Contradiction
A	oh
C	mm
D	those er
C	did you
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a wants to buy a book	Neutral
C	yeah
D	memory sticks and that
C	mm
D	when I I waiting while you went out then I confessed to
A	the computer?
C	mm
D	well the printer that I brought
A	I knew that I said last night to
D	the printer did you say that?
A	yeah
D	well I was going to
D	I said I think I'll take it
C	he said he
A	why didn't you?
C	he said he was going to and then
D	mm
C	he was this this morning I reminded you
[ANNOTATION]	speaker d uses their printer for pictures	Neutral
D	mm
C	and he said well I think I'll leave it today
D	no I said I think he's got enough on
B	mm
D	I blamed you actually
A	I'll leave it for next time
C	mm
[ANNOTATION]	they are work colleagues	Neutral
D	I'll er I'll wait till next time
C	he said what I want him to do is to go through it again and write it down as a
D	step by step
A	yes well you should have done that the first time
C	that's what I said
D	yeah well I
[ANNOTATION]	he had done it fine on his first try	Contradiction
A	they won't learn will they?
C	he said I got so far and then
A	forgot the rest
C	forgotten the rest
D	but what did I say? photographic memory I said
[ANNOTATION]	the remembered everything	Contradiction
A	yes I know you said
D	and you mentioning thirty-five mil you see
A	yes it reminded you
D	you
D	but I think like er er
A	mm
C	no
D	look at him
D	smiling that smile
A	oh I predicted it last night
D	I said well
D	you see how they get
A	yes
A	oh
D	mm
C	mm
D	mm
C	so when is your next marking or anything

D	yes
C	mm mm
A	usually you're begging on
C	mm
A	bended knee yeah
C	are you still doing that English thing that
A	yes
C	yeah
A	as I can yeah
C	are you?
A	yeah
C	yeah er experimental
D	well
A	yeah
D	it's surprising how these things take off and
A	maybe
D	and develop you know
A	yes
D	mm
A	so
D	mm
A	I don't know
B	they are changing GCSEs nearly every
A	oh
B	every year aren't they really?
D	well
A	it's awful isn't it?
D	every
C	yeah
D	er new education minister that comes up starts afresh don't they?
A	something or other it's never still
D	mm
A	for long
D	and I was in at the beginning
C	mm
D	I think I think they called him
A	that's right
D	and he started mm
A	yeah
D	I don't know whether I'd left school or not then don't forget I left actually at thirteen you know
A	mm
D	I started work at fourteen and one week and because my birthday as you know
A	mm
D	but as it goes on they found out oh there's a lot of problems in this one oh and
A	mm
D	away they go again there's no end to it
A	it'll never be right
D	mm
A	mm
C	well I think yours is one of the biggest erm sort of
A	oh yeah
C	that was a very big change wasn't it?
A	yeah
C	mm
A	over the summer yeah
B	I did also get an email which erm to say that they're changing the system a bit
A	which system? the marking?
B	the EPEN system
A	the EPEN?
B	yes
A	oh really?
B	really
A	in what way?
D	what was that
B	well there's
D	oh
A	mm
D	uhu
C	that was before they started it
A	you mean technical requirements of the computer?
B	big change yes
A	to what now?
B	erm I don't think it
A	will we still meet everything?
B	I I think so well
A	mm
B	we've got
A	mm
B	well even three computers and they're all a slightly different
A	yeah set up
B	set up which
A	mm
B	I'd be very surprised well it
A	mm
B	wouldn't work if all three of ours didn't work because
D	mm
A	yeah
A	I usually just leave the Dell set up
B	yes
D	mm
A	for that and then I don't
D	yeah
A	have to
D	that's it
A	tinker about with it
D	mm
A	so that
D	still going strong is it?
A	and make it a bit easier
D	touch wood oh oh dear
B	but you were able to do it on my laptop which
A	I know
B	technically it wasn't supposed to work on there but
D	mm
A	we got it going didn't we?
B	yes
C	mm
A	or you did rather I didn't
C	yeah that's er that might be a little bit
A	mm
C	towards your yeah that's good cos you don't get much erm school work now do you?
A	no mm
C	mm
A	quieter
B	it's very er
C	yeah it's
A	mm
C	yeah
D	that won't be wireless though will it? that won't be wireless
A	the Dell?
B	erm
D	the Dell
B	we're we are no the Dell isn't wireless
D	you just do your
B	we can do it though it's
D	your most er and that
B	it's
D	mm
A	mm
B	but when we did it on the laptop that was with wi-fi
A	mm
D	mm
A	mm
D	mm
B	I think they prefer you not to use wi-fi because it does require quite a bit of sort of data energy from the the wireless system and generally it would have to be a ninety percent strength which is maybe
A	yes
B	just a little bit of a high expectation
A	yeah
B	in real life it doesn't need to be ninety percent but
A	and we are in real life really
B	yes
A	aren't we?
D	yes we do real life yeah
B	it would manage with less it's just it might be
C	mm
B	a little bit sluggish
C	mm
B	but it it's amazing to think we do have the fastest broadband we possibly can and
A	mm
C	you do it
B	erm well erm
C	oh
B	obviously it comes through there which is we have a a fibre optic unlimited broadband plan so it's it's the most advanced
D	are you on fibre optics here then?
B	yes
D	mm
B	a plan
C	oh right
A	a bank
C	where wherever the bank they always say it's a bit slow you know we'll have to wait
D	mm it's slow today
A	yeah
D	it's slow today mm
A	mm
B	I think
C	behind the times you were gonna say
D	backward is the word you're looking for?
B	it's kind of off the map a little bit in regard to internet I think
C	I is it
D	they what they call them?
A	neanderthal
D	there's
A	yeah
D	we're not Mondado Mondeo man yet are we?
A	mm
D	but we're gonna be the
B	mm I wonder er on the television it was saying that Virgin Media are planning to lay a lot of fibre optic cables around the country
A	oh are they?
B	I wonder if they'll er move into
D	us
B	yeah
C	oh no
D	yeah
D	they won't know where it is
D	yes and
C	it won't be on their map
D	no
B	one thing I said I saw that was a a bit of a problem for other operators is that the wires are a different er width compared to the rest of the country in
D	us?
B	yes
D	ah they will be yes yes
C	like the railways wouldn't it?
D	like that railway
C	yeah
D	between Grantham and Newark it's just that bit
D	in that bit
C	and yet we've got our own telephone and erm
A	yeah
C	you know
C	all got
D	mm mm
C	erm you'd think it would be
D	mm
C	top notch wouldn't you really?
D	yes
A	mm
C	but it's not
B	different sized wires in
A	mm
B	compared to the rest of the country
D	mm
B	and crucially more expensive to install wires
D	oh it gets
C	oh
D	from bad to worse doesn't it?
A	mm
C	yeah
D	then it does
A	it's a special case
C	so really they really need to replace them all do they?
B	to replace?
C	all the wires
B	well
C	to be in
B	the
C	line with everybody else
B	they would just the options would be that you'd they it would be just unreasonable to directly just have to really stick with those wires it's really a a decision's been made by presumably
D	mm
B	because obviously
C	yeah
B	you'd have additional expense for compatibility
C	mm
D	yes that's it that's
A	so you're held to ransom in other words
C	mm
D	mm
C	yeah
D	yes that's the sort of trick they would pull and think that was smart that was smart
B	really what they should have done or there should have been a requirement that all the wires had to be the same specification for that country
C	just
A	right okay
C	you would have thought that would have been the case wouldn't you?
A	mm
D	mm
C	mm
D	well mm I think so mm
C	they'll go onto BT and
D	mm
C	Virgin or
D	but I know actually the fibre optic business has come into
B	yes
A	mm
D	er I've been in there
A	mm it's hollow in yes
D	and of course there are a lot of
A	no it's not empty no
D	no and coming through and they've they've er you know it's over the other side and they they've come through and I don't know whether or not it's in
C	no
A	no
D	the fibre glass
B	mm mm
A	mm
D	and I was only when we was the coming
B	about the height of a lamppost? or
D	bit higher than that
B	yeah
D	mm and I I can
C	mm yeah
D	there was
B	mm
D	two more up
C	yes
D	coming out at
C	yes
D	and I says look there's two more there and I think they're something to do with the mobile
B	yes
D	telephones
D	yes
B	there are a a few in this area
C	are there?
B	and like like that are they grey?
D	yes
B	oh yes
D	mm but to me mobile phone masts you see them er maybe in fields or we see some just outside er Paignton there er they're in the wood but they've got all they
A	yeah they're trying to disguise them as trees
D	yes there's all sorts of
B	mm
D	like er dishes on them and that
A	mm
D	which to me that's a mobile phone
A	mm
D	but they really didn't
B	but I suspect it might not be as powerful as that but
D	mm
B	maybe there's a little weak spot
D	mm
B	with a a poor connection in that point so
C	oh yeah
B	they put er
D	mm
B	one that integrates
D	yes
B	a bit better
D	mm
B	erm in an attempt to boost the signal
D	but the but there's they're popping up all over aren't they now?
A	mm
B	mm
C	oh did it?
D	oh that one they had to measure?
B	yes
D	ah mm
A	mm
B	mm
D	has it been dealt with now then?
B	yes I think that
D	mm
B	case has been put to sleep now
D	uhu and is the mast up?
B	yes it's still there
D	how come?
B	now the big thing in
D	yes
C	oh yes
B	he said oh I propose to do it about four miles away from
A	oh right
D	mm
A	I think it's near
B	yes
A	near
C	oh yeah?
D	uhu
C	yeah
B	but it's not actually a district matter
C	oh
B	it's er a county matter but the district council is
C	mm
D	it's and er it er where did that pamphlet come from? a pamphlet was given maybe in
C	yeah
D	and it said that fracking has been banned and it named I think three countries
C	mm
B	mm
D	I think Germany was one
B	yes
D	where it's been banned no fracking in Germany er
B	I think France is another one
D	two other places you know so you know they are but as I was saying to grandma about a month ago in Lincolnshire
B	mm
D	there was er an earthquake
B	yes
D	and it was actually for this country it was fairly big
B	mm
D	it was something like three point four or something
B	on the Richter scale yeah
D	mm now then er in Lancashire er they was doing some fracking there
B	mm
D	somewhere Blackpool way and there were two earthquakes
B	yes
D	and they were attributed to the fracking
B	mm
D	so that's
A	mm
D	to say that er yes there is something in that business but you see at
A	mm
D	to do it aren't they? they're not
A	no well
D	testing it for nothing
A	testing yeah
D	what are they testing for?
A	mm
C	well the people have been er
D	mm
C	of things and in fact the police er
D	mm
C	came and
D	well they've been and
C	knocked them down
D	knocked all the tents down and
C	but they've been there
D	all that business and
C	you know overnight
D	they're still there
C	when people were staying there
D	mm well they've been there ages
C	yeah
D	mm
A	mm
D	is that right
B	mm yeah it's practical
D	mm
C	but we don't we don't want it do we?
D	we
B	well it's there are some nuclear plants in this country I
C	are there?
B	I think it's approximately
C	oh
B	twelve to fifteen percent
D	mm
B	is nuclear
C	oh is it?
B	of our energy
C	I didn't think we had any oh right
D	and don't forget you've both been in one haven't you?
A	Dungeness
D	Dungeness
C	yes
D	mm and they started off on this tour
D	and er that was a really good stab at so you've had the benefit of nuclear power on your bacon and egg
B	mm mm
D	but what they're going to do and going to is er you know smaller nuclear stations er power stations all round and
A	mm
D	and
C	fusion
D	was fusion
A	mm
D	and anyhow
A	yeah
D	but there is another form of atomic power which is the as I say the fission er I think it's fission which doesn't have this these dangers
A	mm
D	but it's a little bit more difficult
A	mm
D	the they do it they can do it in a laboratory you know experimentally to demonstrate it but getting it to be up and running
A	mm
D	to put it into production for electricity is er just but it will come it will they will get it that way mm because electricity it's so we're dependent on it
A	mm
D	all over aren't we? we can't do without it now
A	mm
B	mm
D	and when er Faraday Michael Faraday
A	mm
D	first did it British er first did it and they took the prime minister I don't know who it was the prime minister er Asquith or somebody to show him to demonstrate
A	mm
D	it and that
A	mm
B	uhu
D	so he said well
A	mm
D	you know what good will it be this thing? and Faraday said well one day you'll be able to tax it
A	mm
D	patted and he says
A	mm
D	carry on carry on
A	mm
A	mm
D	our railways now er the going to have it electric aren't they?
A	that's right
D	which means we'll call off the coal
B	mm
D	and actually even in Margaret Thatcher's well even when they was making this bomb you're talking about wartime they realised then er that er
A	mm
D	you that that's why it it went out of favour cos we decided that that coal was just far too expensive and and one way or another er to be continue with coal meaning really for the railways
A	mm
D	cos it's so important having railways like communications so they went to diesel
A	mm
B	mm
D	now they're out
A	mm
D	going to electric
B	mm
D	and there's been a big er conference on and one thing and another to get it electrified from
A	mm
D	electric
C	mm
D	so electricity is the
A	mm
D	to God
A	mm
D	in between them
A	mm
D	that electric spark
A	mm
D	makes you think doesn't it?
C	uhu
D	just having a time check
A	yeah
B	uhu
A	yeah
D	and I think you look really smart
A	mm
B	thank you very much
D	yes very good
D	so next time I come
C	mm
D	the Kodak printer
B	yes
A	get it flushed out
C	mm
D	and I shall write it down
A	take notes this time
D	notes will be taken
C	DVD
D	no not the DVD when she when she went to school and we got her that er
A	the tape recorder cassette?
D	no not tape recorder
A	cassette?
D	the
C	computer? no
A	calculator
D	can't remember
A	calculator
D	oh a calculator the scientific one the scientific
A	oh yeah
D	cos you had a calculator which was ordinary
A	mm
D	which we thought that was
A	mm
D	the eighth wonder of the world didn't we?
C	yeah
A	mm
D	eighth wonder of the world a calculator mm and then came the scientific one and it did square roots and I don't know what
B	mm
D	did everything but make a sandwich
A	mm
D	when you had this one and we wondered where it was all going to end then but
A	mm
C	well
D	yeah
B	well
D	which
B	suppose it's graphical calculator
A	mm
B	the graphical calculator
D	graphical
A	mm
D	well
C	mm
D	and he says oh look that's what
A	mm
D	now look that business and it tells you all sorts of things on that
A	mm
C	on that watch
D	mm
C	what do they call what do they call it
B	a graphical calculator
A	no the Iwatch
D	the the little
B	oh the Iwatch
D	in
C	Iwatch
C	yeah
D	it's got everything cos grandma says well you'll need a magnifying glass that big so as you can see it on there if it's like that
C	well if there's printing on it you know it
A	I wouldn't be be able to see it
C	would be so tiny wouldn't it?
D	mm
A	how they I don't know
C	mind you some of the
B	it's
C	watches now the men's watches are absolutely massive aren't they?
A	yes like
D	mm
C	yeah yeah
A	cos you can get
D	mm
A	yeah
C	no I thought you meant when we had the erm
D	tape recorder?
C	the tape recorder
D	mm
C	I could never do it
D	yes
C	and erm
D	that's it
C	so I said to our
A	mm
C	but I I had to do it
A	in your own words
C	no good me doing the
A	technical
C	no
A	mm
C	whatever and you know I could do it
D	that's why I need the instructions for the Kodak
A	mm
D	all singing all dancing
A	mm
D	it's printing off the screen I can I can do the scanner er and the photo but it's printing off the screen I just haven't
A	mm
D	but don't worry about it
B	well I'll be revising for my exam in the ten weeks but erm
C	I'm sure you will
B	after the ten weeks er we'll be have a bit of a free period till

A	yes
D	for one to
A	mm
D	two nil against Aston Villa
A	oh not bad eh?
D	and but even better than that we drew with Manchester City
A	oh right
D	at Manchester City
A	yeah
D	one one
[ANNOTATION]	Aston Villa lost the game from another team.	Entailment
A	mm
D	and we scored first
A	mm
D	and they were pretty fortunate to score in something like the last ten minutes
A	yeah
D	they were pretty lucky there was a bad back pass on our side or something
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Manchester City got lucky in scoring.	Entailment
D	or on our path which somebody nipped onto and
A	mm
D	did it so that was another point so yes we're er
A	picking up then
D	where things was looking a bit glum
A	mm
D	mm
D	and today they're playing away er
C	oh did they?
