A	this was in the surgery
B	mm
C	did that get a response?
A	nobody
C	I bet every
B	not not for that one
A	no
B	but er
A	and then he
B	then he started telling jokes
A	he started telling jokes
B	and he did have to say to this young girl who was sitting quite near us
A	do you mind if I tell them?
B	you don't mind? And she she was on the phone
A	she was on she was just texting

C	ah
A	but er I said  I said  to him do you know the pheasant pluckers rhyme? Oh he said I've got a better one than that
B	yeah
A	and it was  it was  so fast and so tongue twisty and it was er very very rude
B	but we don't really know what it  what it  was
A	but we couldn't catch it all
C	oh
A	we couldn't catch it all
B	then he got called in unfortunately
A	yeah
B	when we saw him again we said we didn't catch
A	so we're in the
B	mm
A	and he said oh thank you  thank you  And he's one of these blokes that we think there was something seriously with him
B	mm
A	Cos they can't get the medicine for him
C	right
B	and he'd been to see him
A	and and they and er they'd got got to find out whether they could get it
C	mm
A	and he had to phone them back in the afternoon
C	yeah
A	as it is don't they
B	still didn't get it
A	but we we still didn't
A	get it
B	it's just  it's just  a tongue twister
A	A very good tongue twister
C	mm
A	which was very rude
C	the right
B	no
C	the wrong words
B	what what what he says was right
C	yeah
B	but you know you could twist it
A	but you know it
C	you know you could twist it
A	that took the the the the bits like pheasant plucker
C	yeah
A	could be turned round
C	mm
A	to er to be er
B	he'd been practising this one
C	yeah
B	to death
A	and er forty years he says that took me to get this right
C	forty years? Blimey
A	oh that was funny
B	mm
A	that was good
C	mm
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	mm
B	and then I forgot I had to go back in
A	and the doctor come out after her
C	mm
A	she said er have you had
A	so she had to take them all now didn't you
B	mm
A	and then we went back into the surgery not er into the waiting room
C	mm
A	but into the surgery part
A	we er where there's a seat
B	mm
A	yeah
B	well I blew into it
A	two hundred and fifty
A	oh a hundred and fifty
A	A hundred and twenty
C	A hundred and twenty
A	I'm six thirty
B	but mine um that's my usual
B	is my usual
A	A hundred and fifty's your usual
B	I don't breathe very well
A	that's just the best she can do
B	yeah
A	her lung capacity is useless ain't it
B	but I'm okay

B	fit and healthy
C	yeah
C	that's what it's about

C	sore
[ANNOTATION]	the lung capacity is not at its finest	Entailment
A	sore still?
B	yeah
A	you're losing the is it in the hip?
C	I don't know where I don't think it is in the hip
A	is it in the groin?
C	mm no
[ANNOTATION]	speaker c has some pain in their leg	Entailment
A	do you?
C	I really think it's muscle tear
B	so it needs to be
C	compared to the other side
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	speaker c might have a leg injury	Entailment
C	you can
A	yeah
C	and I
B	you should go to physiotherapy again shouldn't you
C	I well they er er all they did was stretch my leg and er they didn't put any hands-on
B	mm
C	put some hands-on pressure and stuff like that
C	not a crepe bandage
B	no?
C	cold on not heat
B	mm
A	oh are you?
[ANNOTATION]	speaker c went to physiotherapy to the main city	Neutral
C	yeah
A	A cold compress?
C	yeah

C	interesting concept
B	mm
C	pulled something
A	yeah
B	oh
C	you put ice on
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	speaker c finds it very neutral and normal	Contradiction

B	oh
C	because all the blood circulation gets going a lot quicker
A	yeah
C	um but if I
A	you can
C	bandages
A	yeah
C	I reckon if I put a really tight one of those on my leg the pain would disappear
A	yeah?

A	what would've happened if you'd have taken the left-hand path instead of the right-hand path
C	yeah
B	mm
C	could've been far worse couldn't it
A	yeah
B	mm
A	I wonder if you
B	sliding Doors
A	if you  if you  have a a life elsewhere where you er took that path
C	took the other path
A	yeah
C	parallel
A	yeah
C	can you just imagine?
B	it is that film Sliding Doors
A	that is Sliding Doors
B	mm
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	mm
A	yeah
B	where she shows both sides of it
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	mm
C	say that's the way it's gonna go
A	yes
B	mm
A	yeah
C	yeah that's what you need really is satisfaction isn't it
A	course it is
C	I think er if you've got satisfaction that's that's the best bit
A	and others decide not to take the path at all and just sit round eating and getting fat
B	yep
A	Don't they?
B	mm
A	when you watch them
B	A lot do with your character though isn't it? Whether you've got ambition or not
A	well yeah
B	well mostly to do with parents
A	I think it's a lot to do with parents
C	yeah
A	our parents were both self-employed
B	yeah
A	you know
C	I think it also depends how strong you are as a character
A	yeah
C	because some people just give up
B	mm
C	it gets to a point where you can you just wanna give up
A	yeah
C	no
A	no
C	mm
A	t the weekend
B	mm
A	well they've got money to do all the tattoos and all stuff
C	but is it the case the people are doing the tattoos are using them as experiments to do the tattoos on?
C	so therefore these people wanna tattoo so therefore they'll be like the guinea-pig
A	yeah
B	mm
A	yeah
C	or they're trying their tattoos out
A	mm
A	with the kids I mean the fifteen-year-old kids that
C	mm
A	you know like
C	mm
A	they're
B	mm
A	but as for the older people I don't know what happened to them
C	mm
A	position
B	mm
C	I think you're right when er huh you said about parents
A	where people live come into it quite a bit don't it
B	yeah
C	because if they see it happening around them
A	yeah
C	then it becomes the norm
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	so therefore that's what you do
A	that's what you do
B	mm
C	but it's also like hm er
B	mm
A	it is a culture thing
B	I mean you you said from going to school that you were never given the the even thought that you could go on to further education
A	never
B	or anything
A	never given the chance
B	left school early
A	didn't even know there was a further education
B	whereas it was pushed my school you went
C	but was that because again back to that area
B	well mm
A	I don't know but we were expected as a secondary school to take up not the academics
C	the the apprenticeship route
A	but the apprenticeship route
C	yeah
A	and if you were any good you er you got an apprenticeship
C	got offered an apprenticeship
A	I mean it didn't cost anything
B	but you weren't given loads of options were you?
A	we were given no options
C	I don't think you I
B	no
C	but going back I don't think the options were there as such
A	well
C	careers people
A	the careers people
B	mm
A	especially what they looked at as second class citizens
C	yeah but at your
A	yeah
B	mm
C	and on the  on the  other side you had people going either into work at Carters or Laurence and Scott
B	mm
A	yes
C	or Autowrappers was Autowrappers?
A	yeah
C	autowrappers
A	heatrae
C	heatrae
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	british tin box company the
B	mm
C	you know

C	start-rite
C	start-rite shoes
A	yeah
C	mhm
A	A huge Courtaulds factory
C	yeah
A	and either they give it to you or they didn't
C	mm
A	loads of work about
C	but if you look at what work is available now
B	mm
C	it's all shop work
A	well it's all service
C	it's all it's service industries
A	yeah
C	I mean
B	yeah
C	that's all that is er is around
A	yeah
C	where people take some more people on
B	mm
A	that's right
C	you know
A	but I mean this is  this is  half the reason half the people er leave the countryside and go to huge cities
C	yeah
A	which isn't that long ago
C	machinery has
A	yeah
C	taken over hasn't it
A	yeah
C	and the way you farm things make er makes it easier
A	yep
A	but that used to be good  that used to be good  but now uh I I feel so sorry for the kids nowadays
C	well they
A	no
C	you know I I don't need this qualification
A	well that's true
C	but you do need the qualification
A	yeah
C	no I don't
C	otherwise you're just gonna end up doing nothing
A	yeah
C	which is why which is what I've witnessed
A	well er
C	recently
A	well you have
C	yeah
A	but as you say they don't they don't take on in
C	you know
A	yeah
B	mm
C	I says because the majority of people that at your stage five ten fifteen it will happen
A	yeah
B	mm
C	what I felt like saying is but in some cases you'll nick what you want so
A	well that's true
B	oh dear
A	that is true
B	huh
A	in some cases that that's what they do
C	mm
C	but it's okay for him to do it at weekends as long as he doesn't during the week
C	that's the attitude of one family
A	hm
C	that I've heard of recently
B	really?
C	yeah
B	huh
C	because it's er because again it's in this area
[ANNOTATION]	person C is talking about area	Entailment

C	yeah
B	yeah
C	and you're thinking er why are you
B	why?
C	why do you need to do?
A	yeah
B	it's er it's wrong it's
C	why do you need to do it?
B	yeah
A	Strange
B	they haven't got enough confidence in themselves
C	you know
A	yeah
C	you know to have a good time you've gotta get absolutely blottoed
B	mm
C	mm
A	no
C	yeah
A	where do they get their money nowadays? When there's hardly any work
B	mm
A	Norwich
C	I think a lot of them drink before they go
A	yeah
C	so once they're there they just top it up
A	they do
B	yeah
A	we had a
B	mm
A	when we were doing this um what was it? The the first aid stuff
B	mm
A	we had that old boy
B	we did
A	he worked on a voluntary bus
B	mm
A	um collecting these
C	mm
A	young girls
C	what the SOS bus?
A	yeah
B	he used to stress all the time
A	yeah

A	but these
B	Cos they looked so awful
A	but they wear next to nothing
B	mm
A	pff
B	yeah
A	clean vest and pants in case you had an accident
B	mm
C	I
B	mm
A	no I
C	mm
A	for allowing it to happen in the first place
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	mm
A	absolutely blotto and pissed
B	you see the pubs used to close early
A	yeah
B	you know perhaps
C	half past five half past ten wasn't it

B	so it made a huge difference didn't it
A	well they wanted to go Continental didn't they
B	mm
A	but I mean that's only recently that the they've had pubs open all the time
C	but it's made no difference
A	that's made no difference at all
C	I think in some respects that side of it apart from the number of pubs closing down because there isn't the money around that bit's alright
A	the binge drinking
C	Thursday Friday
B	mm
C	Saturday night
A	yeah
C	where you've got all those bars

A	have a picnic area didn't they
B	round this statue
C	yeah
A	well only a lawn
B	what with grass?

C	well you think of how how many times they've changed the footpaths around
A	yeah
B	mm
A	yeah
C	right
A	yeah
C	so years ago it was we'll get rid of all the flagstones

B	mm
C	few years later all the tarmac comes up
A	mm
C	and they start putting Brickweave down
A	brickweave down
B	mm
A	yeah
C	few years later Brickweave doesn't work
B	cobbles so that
B	cars can
C	yeah
A	yeah
B	mm
A	yeah
C	and if you take you know then if you take about what they've done round the Forum
A	they did didn't they
C	because they were too soft
A	yeah
B	oh really?
C	and they were all
A	yeah
B	no
A	oh dear
B	mm
A	well they used used to be a time where they used to have to get rid of their money pot before the end of April didn't they
C	mm
A	otherwise they wouldn't get it allocated again
C	yeah
A	the next year
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	Cos you can't do that in schools
B	mm
C	where I am at the moment I still think I was telling you where I am at the moment they have kept their budget in credit
A	yeah
B	right
C	right
B	mm
C	want to retire
B	right
C	alright? But they want to go maybe a year early or two years earlier
B	mm
C	but because the school keeps its budget on line they can't make them retire
B	oh
C	if the school was in a deficit budget and they needed to get rid of these members of staff then they would get help on
B	they'd get help
C	yeah
A	getting rid of
C	getting rid of
B	they could
C	no
B	no?
A	that's pathetic ain't it
B	how weird
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	well that's the situation
B	yeah
C	no
B	on any sort of benefits
A	no
C	er
B	anyone who's got any savings then er
C	he was at
B	lose out
A	yeah
A	yeah
C	now I don't know how far it will go
A	yeah
C	and it was saying that
[ANNOTATION]	B advises having savings for emergencies.	Neutral
A	yeah
B	mm
C	you've got some accountability
A	yeah
C	who are the academies accountable to?
B	mm
A	well that's true
C	are are they accountable to the government?
[ANNOTATION]	Everyone knows who the academies are accountable to.	Contradiction
[ANNOTATION]	Everyone knows who the academies are accountable to,	Contradiction
B	mm
C	because the government have allowed them to become academies
A	academies
C	or are they accountable to their sponsors?
B	right
C	which isn't the government
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	Cos the council has got nothing to do with them any more
C	nothing to do with them
[ANNOTATION]	The council and the academies are not affiliated anymore.	Entailment
A	nothing at all to do with them
C	nothing to do
A	that is  that is  a thought that is ain't it
C	and you you kind of think that you know here's a person that is working for an academy
A	yeah
C	they don't care
B	mm
[ANNOTATION]	The council worked with the academies in the past.	Entailment
C	and what they're saying is it's all because the er predecessor school had a deficit budget
A	no
C	because it was wiped clean on the thirty-first of August
B	right
C	when it became an academy
B	mm
C	county
A	yeah
C	so they all got a little bit less to cover that budget
[ANNOTATION]	C used to work for the city council.	Neutral
B	mm
A	well
C	you know
B	tut
C	which
B	mm
C	you know where that's gonna lead to? That's gonna lead to saying
[ANNOTATION]	They are taking the full responsibility.	Contradiction
B	yeah
C	we've gotta cut some more staff
A	well yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	er the great teacher pit
C	oh well er
A	yeah
B	mm
C	and some will end up with nervous breakdowns
A	yeah
C	and some people will will move on to doing something else
B	mm
C	and they'll keep the costs down by having lots of NQT teachers in for three or four years where they don't have to
B	mm
C	pay them a certain amount of money
A	yeah
B	or parents doing some bit of voluntary work to help out
C	yeah
B	mm
A	do they still use parents in academies? Or not?
C	no
A	no
B	mm
C	no
A	they only use them in
C	in the little schools
B	mm
C	they try and keep parents out
A	yeah
C	or they mm
B	yeah
C	try and tell them things which are not going on
A	yeah
B	Don't need parents in schools
A	no
B	mm
C	you don't want  you don't want  people who care in schools in academies
B	mm
A	well that's right
C	everybody's
B	no
C	quick to moan
A	yeah
B	mm
C	to
B	well
A	I mean
C	mm
A	and people that
C	it's a trust isn't it
A	it's a trust
B	yeah
C	it's one
A	I don't know
B	mm
C	but isn't but that's what the doctors are arguing about
A	well that's er right
C	that shouldn't it shouldn't be they shouldn't have that responsibility
A	no
C	but if you put people that are managers in all they do is want to cut back things and
C	save the money
B	mm
A	of course they do
C	mm
A	but I mean the matrons in hospital used to keep keep the wards running didn't they
C	if we can get you home then that's the best isn't it
A	I mean you used to go to the maternity hospital and have the baby and stay in for er until they were thought they were okay to go home
C	twenty-four hours isn't it
A	twenty-four hour turn-over
B	mm
A	and they still reckon they haven't got any money
C	mm
A	you know
C	they they wanna cut back on all the good things
A	mm
C	that's what they that's what they're doing in education
A	yeah
C	but it's gonna have a knock-on effect on what pupils choose
A	has she's picked her
