C	yeah that's the
B	you would have been better with the grapes
C	on the recording no one can see you scream

A	obesity is not the same thing
C	right
E	you couldn't make it
A	oh my god
E	you can't get arrested for obesity
A	no that I saw this er this Tumblr blog it was called this is
B	oh yes I like that blog
A	yeah basically basically a woman who is
C	the seats weren't big enough for her arse
A	the the seats weren't big enough and she she had to seek she had had to take up more than one seat
C	yeah
A	but the girl the girl next to her wasn't happy that she was kind of spilling over
E	oh
C	yeah
A	and so she put a cardboard thing like like to try and stop her
B	I know I've seen it
A	her fat from spilling over
C	I know you've seen
A	and she complained about it she goes oh it's so horrible you know I I can't
C	well well wait then
A	that that's my point
B	I don't wanna be touched by your
C	my fat is spilling over the seats
A	yeah it's it's like
E	do more exercise and eat healthily
A	and and and also she said that erm her cousin or something came over there was a family gathering her cousin came over and she lost weight she lost like a bit of weight and she was feeling happy about herself
E	she
A	a massive attention seeker
C	so what was that
A	you know just just because you're too lazy or have no motivation to lose weight doesn't mean that you have to shit on everyone else's
A	like
C	not all of it's
E	well then you should accept me for who I am I am fat
C	not all of it is diet and exercise because
A	they no they they they
C	there can be like thyroid problems or
A	yeah but
C	some people are just naturally large
A	yeah but the amount of people who are obese they can't all claim that they have thyroid problems
E	no
D	yeah
B	so that means this one's for
C	and you
A	not
D	who's
C	no
E	well we're seeing her at
B	yeah we'll see her at the birthday thing
D	okay so I'll keep her stuff till then

B	is it the killing my best friend pack
A	no is it is it Nicole
C	yeah that one that one
D	oh
A	dear fat people
D	I came in with something like totally unrelated
C	I think she was kind of on point though
A	she she kind of was but the way she said it wasn't right but I mean I do agree with her I think some people are just becoming
A	er I mean obviously don't be insulting people there's no need for it but it's selling
C	well she was kind of hurtful and some some of the comments were
A	but but but telling people oh you know it's perfectly healthy to be four hundred pounds no it isn't stop deluding yourself
B	oh no that's not that's not
A	it it it's not healthy to be four four hundred pounds
C	I weigh sixty er no sorry pounds okay no sixty kilograms
E	sixty pounds? that's like
E	four stone
A	no but it's not
A	it's not healthy to be four hundred pounds I'm not saying that you have to shame anyone for it but don't don't
B	no just don't say it's healthy when it's not
A	don't don't be saying oh I'm perfectly healthy at four hundred pounds you're not healthy
E	your blood sugar's probably like
A	and then and then they say oh I did loads of exercise and I went on a diet and I still stayed the same weight I highly doubt it
C	yeah did it for two weeks
A	like I I I really really doubt you did it properly
E	they need to
C	but some of these people
A	yeah
C	they go on a diet but they still snack and that's their problem
A	yeah
C	and they don't realise that they're just they're like oh I'm on a diet but I can have this
A	oh er
C	like
A	where they do that thing where erm they'll
B	mm
A	they eat each day for a week or something
E	yeah
C	don't they lay it out on a table? they say you know this is what you have each week
A	no that might be a different one but they do they do it in a tube erm and they just dump it all in and then it fills up and so there's one person who doesn't eat enough and then there's one person who eats too much and they swap diets for
B	mm
A	but yeah
D	but that's not even that healthy because
A	no I know they they only do it for a week and then they get advised on it
E	well they
A	how to do it properly so
B	mm
E	do it properly for god's sake
A	do it properly oh my god
A	you're not eating properly
C	what is what is the word? malnutrition no it's
A	malnourished
E	malnutrition is just
B	yeah malnourished
A	malnutritionised
B	I don't erm
C	it's just whether you're not
E	over
D	I like
A	I did as well
D	and I joined the gym

D	I bought a skirt in a size sixteen the other day and I was like woo hoo this is one of my skinny days cos yeah I was gonna wear it tonight and I can't couldn't sit in it today so I was like okay I probably won't today cos I've had erm lunch before I came out
C	one of the pins has come out and where I went like that it came through
B	oh
D	but erm
C	fucking mercy badge
D	because I was walking more and eating less
A	yeah I do a lot more walking when I'm at
C	and sand
A	I didn't even hear it what?
B	it was an intelligent joke
C	I lost count
A	oh okay ha ha
E	terrible
B	is that what you would that's what you were doing
E	you should be ashamed of yourself
C	I come up with so many
B	what's wrong with the cat?
A	why are they're
B	yeah?
D	why do you have a toothbrush in your kitchen?
B	erm
C	for brushing her teeth
B	that's a good question I think sometimes
C	it'll be for cleaning

C	okay it's not for cleaning then
B	when someone's in the shower
C	oh okay
C	alright
C	sorry
B	oh
B	yeah we don't do that
B	yeah he does
B	he just like takes
C	toothbrush
B	toothbrushes
C	what like sheets
A	did you
C	like that
A	do you know English
C	apparently neither do you do you know English?
A	what was wrong with that?
C	the sentence is incorrect
A	how is how is
D	how would you correct it?
A	how is do you know English incorrect? do you know English?
C	do you understand it?
B	that's
E	do you know? do you
C	I don't it sounds wrong in my head
E	do you know England?
A	well cos you don't know English
B	it's a perfectly legitimate question
D	perfectly legit
E	legit
D	no but I can't believe some people at university they're
C	I sound really pretentious sometimes
D	but some of the people
D	and this girl that took charge
unknown_female	so like everything in our final report I think there were about two sentences that were like actually my words cos I'd send it to her and she'd like change around the order of my sentences
B	mm
A	mm
D	she'd switch around the order of the clause and I'd be like
D	she doesn't know how to use commas
D	like she doesn't know where to put commas in a sentence
B	mm
C	from Friends
D	I'm like
D	and I was like
C	confident yeah
D	that it's gonna be amazing because
A	no
D	the and I spent she said that she was on top of the referencing I volunteered so many times that I
D	I don't know
E	in text referencing
C	cos we're were taught to use Refme
D	we we have our own university guide so we have
E	oh are you
D	we have a erm
E	is it the
D	no we have
unknown_female	mm
unknown_female	for business law and
A	I I I mean
E	so stupid man
A	I mean I I got I got
C	so the
E	mm
C	erm is that just the in brackets the website or book and then the year?
D	no that's wrong
C	and then the
D	no
C	that's what I've been taught I don't know and then the outer text was
D	er I mean everywhere does it different
A	I mean I have to use APA which is American Psychological Association so I have to use that style of referencing
D	yeah
A	and also formatting my lab reports and things like that
D	oh right
A	of the first time you mention it I didn't know that I thought you had to mention every every author
B	the first time
A	the first time and then you could abbreviate it but apparently you can abbreviate it when there's six or more I didn't know that they didn't say it
B	yeah
A	so
C	but surely you need to do it at least once to actually identify the authors
B	well apparently not
A	no that's
B	well you do that at the end of text yeah
C	does that make sense?
A	yeah that's what I did do but then they said oh you don't have to do that if there's six or more
B	yeah
A	you can just
unknown_female	mm
unknown_female	I was like okay I'll do that next time
unknown_female	mm
C	how
D	we get given a guide and it's like forty pages long and it sets out every circumstances you can think of for in text and end of text
D	yet some people still do it wrong
unknown_female	and I was so pissed off because the next day we were editing it as a group and she'd given it to our tutor and he
A	mm
D	your referencing is so wrong it took me three hours to correct it so I don't care whether you think this is okay we are putting what I've done into this report because it's about the only thing I've actually done like in evidence so I made her sit there with me she scrolled through and every reference I was like okay that's wrong it should be this
D	so we went to the I went to the erm
A	mm
D	as that and then you know the year and the name er what
C	so the out of text references how do you do it? because the way I do it is you do either the author or the website if there's no author stated
D	a
C	and then you do the date er
D	we do just year in brackets
C	okay
D	if it's online sourced the title is not in italics when it's a book
B	can I use your
C	okay
D	the title's in italics if it's a journal the title's not in italics but the title of the journal's in italics
C	okay cos we do the title of the thing in italics online cos we've only ever used online
B	no
D	and then you do online in square brackets
unknown_female	then you do available from the URL and then accessed and then the date you accessed it in square brackets
C	no me just do available at colon
A	yeah
C	URL it's not edited it's not in square brackets at all and then open brackets accessed if oh sorry updated if you know when it was updated and then accessed
D	mm
unknown_female	mm
unknown_female	and it just annoys me how when we're given a guide that is this long I know referencing takes time but don't say you're on top of it and then hand me this shit piece of work that's such a mess
C	right
D	in the in text and we
C	for as far as I'm aware in text all you do is open bracket website name or author
D	yeah
C	year
D	year
C	yeah but we've er we've never used a book we've only ever done online so I don't know how to do other references
D	yeah but it just it just annoyed me
D	fallen asleep
C	his fingers are still
D	are you doing what you do as a reference?
A	yeah I'm just giving an example this pen's not very good it's a bit
C	is it?
A	worn down yeah
unknown_female	mm
unknown_female	erm
D	oh and then we have to do like publisher like
B	at work we do page references to other pages in the
[ANNOTATION]	The publisher does the page references.	Neutral
B	and that's just a letter and a number
B	and that's it
C	lucky you
B	oh but most of the sentences I write start with the word being which is a really annoying way to write a
C	being?
B	yeah because we have to write journals and then you write oh debit this credit this
C	right
B	mm
D	we do have to do like if you're reading a textbook and it says this person once said this
C	so last name comma
E	Smith A two
C	and just er yeah
E	what do two
E	oh sorry
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Nobody writes journals.	Contradiction
C	is that reformed?
A	oh that's referencing one O one
C	yeah
A	yeah no you do the author's name so like surname then their first name initial
C	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	You have to put the surname first.	Entailment
A	and then like that you do the year
C	yeah I got that
A	that's the that's the title of
C	yeah
A	that's the title of the journal in italics
unknown_female	that is the I believe the issue number?
D	oh yeah you have to do like issue
C	don't you have to put on the ISBN on there as well?
D	no
A	no we don't have to
C	no?
A	no we don't and then that those are the page numbers
[ANNOTATION]	You always put in the page numbers.	Neutral
C	yeah
unknown_female	mm
A	so yeah
C	because your in text is short and then your out of text is
A	yeah your in text is just their their surnames and the year for us
[ANNOTATION]	In the text you put the surname and year.	Entailment
C	yeah
B	mm
C	and just to clarify your references are the ones you've used in text but the bibliography is everything you've used to influence you?
A	yeah
D	no for us
C	no?
D	our bibliography is just everything in text
[ANNOTATION]	Everything in the text is in the bibliography.	Entailment
A	we don't we
C	so
D	we
unknown_female	mm
A	we we don't do a bibliography we just do references
C	no?
D	mm
C	okay so is it meant to be?
D	so we only have to reference stuff that we've actually used
A	I don't understand why you'd have to
B	mm
A	in the text it just seems pointless
C	I think we have to do it
D	cos a lot of the time I will Google something if I don't really understand it first I will Google it so that I can actually understand it
C	yeah
D	and then
C	yeah
D	so I wouldn't reference whatever I googled cos
A	yeah
C	are you meant
D	alphabetical
A	alphabetical yeah
C	cos I've been told to do that for the bibliography it's meant to be alphabetical
D	yeah
A	no it is it's alphabetical for references
C	right
D	one girl used footnotes
C	I've done that
D	and she er cos for us we get ten marks
C	oh do you do citations?
D	we get erm
C	oh right
D	er footnotes
C	yeah
D	and she was like oh it's just easier that's the way I wanna do it so I'm gonna put in footnotes
A	that's not that's not how it works it's not it's not the way you wanna do it that works
C	no you
D	mm
B	I don't wanna
A	I thought this was about being independent at uni? I don't know what you're talking about
A	do you have erm
B	yes there are some bits of sock on the side there
C	bits of sock
C	I hope it's washed
C	obviously yeah
unknown_female	mm
A	I remember oh ow that's hot
E	boo
A	erm
A	that you shouldn't do
B	yeah
A	and
A	half of it was plagiarised
A	and it didn't even make any sense and then the one of the last sentences in in their essay and it
A	and and
C	do you reference your seminar notes?
B	no
A	no
C	no?
B	not
A	no I I I I only
A	I only referenced erm the journal articles that
D	you're allowed to like use sources that your teachers have directed you to and reference those
A	yeah
D	but you're not allowed to like reference my lecturer
A	yeah
C	yeah
E	I would've thought you'd been able to
B	no
A	no
C	yeah I know about that
A	you're not allowed to use work that you have submitted before
B	can't you reference yourself though?
A	I don't I don't think so
A	cos cos how would you reference yourself? it'd be like
B	well you could like put down the the bit of text you wanna use from your other paper and then say
A	yeah but no but but but
A	two thousand and fifteen
C	I've heard about that cos I did one essay and then I did another which was a similar sort of frame not the same topic but it was about research methodologies
B	yeah
C	so different types so I thought
C	but can't
D	yeah I have
D	we had formative and summative assessments for responsible event management and basically our formative assessment so one we get feedback on
B	mm
D	the
C	like because you haven't
D	but our formative
A	that that makes sense
B	yeah
A	because you know I we we submit all our essays and lab reports through turn it in
B	mm
C	have you found turn it in is a bit rubbish that I mean like
B	no not really
C	a couple of things I've referenced correctly and it'll flag it up
D	no it'll flag up everything
C	yeah I know
D	because even if you referenced it the it flags up and then if you've
C	yeah it's a good and bad system because sometimes you can like click on it and be like
B	yeah
C	I thought
A	yeah
C	yeah I probably would've used the same phrase somewhere which would be online
D	but you have to
C	mm
C	there are a couple of phrases I used and I thought okay
C	well someone else is gonna speak like I am
D	see I only had nine percent
C	how much were you allowed percentage wise?
D	it actually doesn't really matter because obviously if you get into like fifty
C	a hundred percent
D	percent then your entire essay is like quotes and stuff then that's not good but anything from sort of obviously too low means you haven't used enough evidence
C	okay
D	because any evidence you've used any quotes will be flagged up as being similar
A	you're not
D	especially if it's from
A	we're not we're not meant to use quotations
D	oh we are
C	no?
A	no we're not allowed to unless it's something that you can't word in a different way
B	no we're a little bit
D	we're encouraged to use a mixture of paraphrasing
A	no we're not we're not supposed to it's only to be used
B	mm
A	you know thirty days hath September blah blah blah
A	erm and they said that I'm like what are you on?
A	that was just a quote and it took up
B	mm
A	erm I I'm I'm tempted to show you
B	yeah
A	cos it's just awful
D	it's just yeah similarity's a bit weird as you you're sort of safe anything from about
C	we're allowed up to twenty-five which is really generous
D	but there's but there's no like big thing because as long as you've referenced it all and everything you've put in
C	it's as long as you can prove it somewhere
D	yeah and
C	apparently there was this girl er a few years ago
A	mm
C	because she refused to after being told that she needs to change it
B	mm
A	why would you refuse after someone's told you
A	you've got it too
C	I don't know
A	you've you've
B	maybe it was all maybe honestly was all her own work
C	yeah that's
B	you would still
D	no but the thing is as long as it's
C	word it that's
D	referenced like we're allowed twenty-five percent as long as
E	yeah
D	that twenty-five percent of work that has been copied from other sources or paraphrased is is referenced
D	and some people don't do enough referencing like one girl
C	that's quite a lot
D	that is a lot
C	for
D	erm
E	mm
D	that's no that's not enough
C	that's not enough?
D	not not for the task that it was
C	right
D	it wasn't enough
A	let me see how many references I had for my essays
D	I had thirty-two
C	cos even some of the research like the stuff I've had to research I haven't used
D	the thing is we had to write
C	for three thousand words
D	er erm as part of that assignment we had to write a an a thousand word essay about a erm issue or a topic that we were interested in
C	ah
D	so there's gonna be a lot of that online sources in theory to go with that like I did do sports events and athletes encourage or promote antisocial behaviour and violence on and off the field?
C	mm
E	do they?
C	football does
D	yeah
C	but that's racism
D	yeah
D	so I spoke about
E	don't know why
D	I spoke about racism in sport and why I thought that it was
E	I'm not even sure how racism comes into sport like
A	what do you mean how does it not come into sport?
D	sport has always football has always been the sport of the lower classes it sounds bad to say it but it has been it was a cheap sport they were easy to follow rules
C	mm
D	like compared to rugby
C	like lacrosse
E	mm
D	are still carried through today
E	I just meant like
D	that's why I wrote that
E	not even sure how it works
C	so the lower class people who
D	it's just it's just the erm
E	so everyone who supports a football
D	no just their just their values and how they erm
C	racism and
D	and racism even like off the field between like fans and stuff so
A	mm
D	yeah and how
C	it's a real laddie sport as well
D	and how it's promoting like numbers of erm
E	I wouldn't say it was laddie but
D	numbers of like
C	you you know the type
E	cockney
C	yeah cockney footballers yeah
A	common
B	commoners
C	common
D	I I cos I found an article that spoke about how erm you wouldn't find like erm
E	no respect
D	erm respect and authority erm
C	they like
D	it's you know the lower classes were known for rebelling against authority they didn't
C	mm
D	they had to they always wanted to rebel against it so that's sort of something that's
D	yeah so that's why I wrote that
D	and so there were a lot of sources for that
A	mm
D	a lot of sources
B	yeah I think so
C	you were standing on it just like
A	hm
C	hm
C	yeah
A	okay
E	is it meant to be good or bad?
A	bad
D	mm hm
A	okay so so the question was er describe ways in which psychologists have studied techniques for improving memory and discuss how they might be applied to revising for examinations
C	it's a hard question
A	I didn't do this I did Piaget that was my
B	no I didn't understand the question
C	no I don't either but okay
A	basically erm
B	use psychology to help you remembering stuff
C	was it
D	no it's
D	so it's different methods to look at improving memory
A	how
D	and how that can help in revision methods
A	yeah and examinations it's just
D	I get it guys
A	it's just it's just
B	yeah but you go to uni
D	yeah but I've never done psychology
A	we we I don't I don't know I don't know when they did this
B	I just I just fudge numbers that's all I do
D	I think it's a pretty simple question
A	yeah I I don't know
C	you're not meant to fudge the numbers you're meant to do the numbers
A	oh maybe it'll be second
C	yeah
A	okay erm they they start off I've always thought that my memory was really good
D	as a first off using first person
E	I
A	yeah
B	one this
C	this person knows about that
D	no
A	one thinks that one's memory has been really good
A	no
C	one thinks
D	no
C	you can't
E	why not?
C	like some of the questions I've had in my assignment are what are your personal achievements? I was like
C	I can't say I
A	yeah but it
A	however
D	wait what?
D	saying that I might do better in an examination
B	I might do better if I could remember the answers
A	yeah
C	mm
E	mm
A	erm I therefore bought a book by someone called
D	have they put by someone cool?
A	yes
A	Tony
D	first names and
E	by this guy called
A	the the the the
A	erm
C	genius
A	erm he was very keen on what he calls mind maps
D	that's what I call
A	erm
C	yeah cos some people call them spider diagrams or
B	oh yeah they they wanted to call them thought showers for a bit but they but they thought
A	that is a stupid name
C	thought showers
B	yeah but then they thought that was upsetting to
A	hey guys work in groups and create your thought showers I mean
C	yeah
C	thought cloud
B	erm it's like a thought diagram or something
B	like a thought map or something
C	okay
B	thought bubble
A	erm okay
E	oh
A	er
D	mm
A	describe my maps as quotation
E	that's a
A	I use my maps in my revision for A level
A	and that that's the paragraph
D	but where's the introduction?
A	that is the introduction
C	that's GCSE
E	I use mind maps
D	oh they're really good
B	what about mind maps?
D	this one guy one once said that mind maps are good
A	I I was disappointed cos I didn't use mind maps
D	that's so bad cos essays aren't meant to be personal
A	no
B	that is so bad
C	mm
A	oh no there's also there's also this bit where their writing style completely changes because they just copied and pasted off someone
A	and it's so it's so obvious like the the the seminar
A	let let let
C	predominance and
B	get random words
A	it it it it becomes much more sophisticated basically
A	let me
C	enlighten us
C	story time
A	oh no here's a good explanation of erm a a
A	the place method involves using images and so does the peg method
B	what?
A	no
B	oh good
A	okay
D	but what
B	I still don't get this
A	pegs replace places
C	pegs what actual pegs
A	I don't even know what it is
A	they still haven't explained it
B	is it a memory method?
A	I think so it it's meant to be
D	if they're still
A	it must have been I can't think of any
A	they must have done this last minute in a panic
D	yeah but I did that and I
A	no but I mean I mean they must have really been in a panic
A	like like like you know like they they left it they fell asleep woke up in the middle of the night oh shit I've got an essay due
D	and were like oh shit
B	they're just dream typing it
A	yeah erm
C	technique
B	what?
C	your
A	oh
B	that's nothing to do with essay writing
A	this this this one this one's
A	this one's really clear as well
C	mm
B	mm hm
A	psychologists have studied other ways of improving memory as well
C	that's good for psychologists
A	it's good good for them what what psychologists? erm
A	erm
A	did this
C	they did this
B	they did what?
A	make up stories that link words together
B	apparently not
A	another technique is to translate numbers into consonants and put vowels between them to make words
B	what does that even mean?
A	er
C	do you wanna say that again? say
C	say that sentence again please?
A	another technique is to translate numbers into consonants and put vowels between them to make words
C	right so like
D	wait that's a memory technique?
C	so like A is one
C	B is two C is three
A	I I I have no idea
A	I
B	how can how can another be a consonant?
C	you'd have to cite
A	I don't know
C	you'd have to sign the
A	they haven't explained
C	so like B is one and C is two then D is three then F is
D	no because A is a vowel
B	yeah he's skipped out A
C	that's it
D	oh
C	A
D	it just sounds confusing
E	so it'd be three four
D	and then you have to put vowels in between those?
E	three four knock on the door five six pick up sticks
C	I don't know mm
E	seven eight
D	I don't know
C	I don't remember that one
E	yeah would be good if they came
C	nine ten start again
E	go give an example
C	they did this they put the
D	yeah this person
B	I don't even know what you're talking about
E	mind maps are good
E	not my
C	I
C	other friends
C	you're
D	no not to offend you guys but I never talk about you in any of my essays
B	how could you?
C	why don't you talk about us for event management?
E	why?
B	well
B	managing a
D	cos this person goes my friends really like mind maps
C	alright
D	and I was like I'm really sorry I never talked about
B	my friends really like events
D	my friends go to events all the time
E	so I go to
C	yeah some people host them
E	my my friend
E	ooh ooh
D	in this essay I'm going to analyse my friend
B	to analyse my event hosting
C	she got it
E	she did not give out any invitations
C	what was it?
D	yeah yeah where's the invitations?
B	it was on the internet
C	the invitation was on Facebook
D	okay
A	here's here's a
A	here here's a nice
B	thank you
A	here here's a nice two line paragraph that's just randomly placed in the middle of this
E	I thought you I thought you actually said that
A	no they they they put SF
C	okay
C	some
B	we know who they are though
A	with
B	what does that? what?
A	er I think it means he was able to remember eighty digits or something
B	okay
A	erm
C	one two three four five
A	of of
B	what?
E	of running times?
A	I don't know what this essay's on about
B	I don't even understand
E	eighty digits well there are only ten digits
C	the examiner would just be like great great news
A	great
C	great well done
A	oh he he he should
A	I don't know they just referenced a load of people that weren't psychologists
A	and they they they and they they either they just said psychologists in general but actually referencing anyone
C	what's the number where
D	do you have to reference like does everything you have to
D	be about erm
B	twenty-one thirty-five eight
C	yeah okay
D	be about er psychology because we're allowed to cross over so for example I reference stuff about sports science
E	cross over to the dark side
D	and I've referenced things about behaviour and team work within a health care facility
C	especially if it's something you don't understand you've had to like research for
D	and I I've written about cognitive like erm
D	when I did erm about like
C	dunno
D	how some people
B	no I mean the
D	a erm it's a popular school of thought that erm sports can actually help young people in schools
D	erm develop skills and blah blah blah
A	mm
D	and that was written in a paper about erm behavioural psychology I think it was in a
A	oh yeah it was about the
D	methods of improving behaviour in schools
A	I mean
D	we're allowed to cross over quite a bit
A	we
D	I guess there's
A	yeah
C	I can't remember
C	yeah Endor with the Ewoks
B	yeah
B	oh yeah it's about the
B	mm
C	er
B	is that it?
D	are you allowed to do that though? cos we have to we have to have books as well like actual academic
C	I've only just jumped into the conversation here you have to have
A	no you can you can just use journal articles I've used cos what what they expect you to do
D	so your so the textbooks you have are more about your
A	yeah and you know if if if you find pieces of research in there that you find interesting you can use them but you have to go and find the original journal article to use them
D	oh cos I had to
E	they're talking about
C	what a library has to have books
E	I
E	I just go up to the counter and be like
C	what
B	okay
C	we have a library but an online library of journals at at
D	yeah we have that but well I
C	we've got an online library
D	like I had to find
B	I don't know
C	no
D	I was looking for the definition of assault and battery like I knew the definition cos I've done law
C	oh yeah
D	but I had to find something that I could reference this from so I found Archibald's law which is like a four thousand page book and it's in its like sixty
D	second
C	such a
D	and it we have a copy of it one copy of it in the library and it's reference only so I was like mine I need it
E	give it
D	so I found it in there
B	mm
D	like I knew what page I needed and found it in there and then I looked on Amazon how much is this? like I was just intrigued
A	oh
D	brand new is four hundred pounds
B	oh
C	jesus
A	jeez
D	and that's like I was looking up other law textbooks that they have to have
C	it must be like only law books
D	and it's so expensive
D	you have statutes but you have a lot of common law
C	yeah
D	erm things
C	common law
D	assault and battery of common law so they're not actually defined anywhere by government
C	yeah
D	you find it in Archibald
C	okay
D	so it's it is
A	mm
D	very important book
E	so does the does the
D	well that probably not in the in the court but they'll probably have several copies several versions of it in their office
C	okay
D	I I mean I didn't sit there and read it
D	but yes erm
D	yeah
D	erm cos the reason I knew I needed to find that was because I
D	and I found a article that had referenced Archibald and it's so big and the writing's so small that
D	yeah cos it will probably take you an hour to find what you were trying to find on the page just on that one page so it references the section and then you go to the section on the page
C	okay
D	and it
B	I'm surprised you're even allowed to take it out the library
D	no I didn't I this was when I was on my fifteen hour stint in the library and I had piles of books
C	did you say
D	piles of books
C	taken out the library are ones of identification
D	oh I haven't taken any er
C	see what species of
[ANNOTATION]	they are in the library	Contradiction
D	I haven't taken any books out of the library cos the only time I actually went in the library to look for books was when I was doing it all like on the last week of term so there was no point taking the books out because it's like I'll be back in here tomorrow so
C	what are you actually doing on your course
E	well
C	right
E	and er
D	you also do quite a bit of
E	yeah one of our assignments is we have to pick a habitat so erm and mine's this reservoir that's a short walk from campus

B	this year
B	see
C	it's not a
B	well it's not so bad it's not like the whole width of the word away
C	it's because I move my pen to move all
C	it does
D	but I I cos I haven't written like a long piece of writing handwriting for so long I was leaving a note for my mum on the table about putting turning on the washing machine
B	oh
C	sorry

[ANNOTATION]	someone don't mind the mess	Contradiction

D	I can't write on a straight line even any more
C	I mean like the end of the sentence can curve up if I'm on plain paper with no lines
C	it it curves up and curves down
C	but when I correct it then there's like a triangle of white space
C	because I've corrected it

C	there was a whole thing where the
[ANNOTATION]	someone never joins letters	Contradiction

B	oh yeah
E	some people's fingers were quite big
D	some people
E	what if they had no hand?
D	stop
D	and it'll be like four words per line
E	use finger spaces but not like
B	yeah that's the true
