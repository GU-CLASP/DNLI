G	and he so he'll grow up to be a big tough boy
G	er
D	really?
B	well you see look at his father and his sisters
B	I don't think he's gonna have the required bulk and weight
C	what about his brother?

B	no I suspect
C	what about his brother? I
unknown_female	mm
B	yeah

C	look at that look at that bulk
C	look at that bulk on mum
unknown_female	yeah mine are still noodles
unknown_female	mine aren't even noodles
C	mine are rock hard
D	means you've got to bulk up

unknown_female	my bulk is just like
D	or they're
G	well if you're like his mother you could play
C	mine are rock hard
D	well
C	where the powering from my arm
F	erm
B	he could play for England or
G	but I I don't think with a name like
unknown_female	it's all
G	you've ruled that out
unknown_female	dad
B	what?
unknown_female	it's all
B	I see
F	erm if you're
F	if you're born in a stable
unknown_female	you've still got to
F	it doesn't make you a horse
F	so
D	yeah right
F	if you're born in a stable
B	er what
F	you don't you're not make doesn't make you a horse
G	no
D	right
G	my two older children
B	what?
G	were born
B	well conversely that is
C	but
F	that's right but but
B	but conversely if you weren't born in a stable doesn't mean you weren't a horse
F	yes yes oh
B	so so you know
F	I would agree with that
unknown_female	and cos it's more
B	you could be born outside of the stables and still be
D	do you want?
B	a horse
B	no thank you
unknown_female	what you are is more like to do with your environment and
F	absolutely
unknown_female	the effects it had on you
F	and that's and that's why we are the way we are
F	absolutely I have to
G	no
F	I have to admit they are more English than Scottish but when
G	when
F	yes? he actually it was better to to admit or say that he was English rather than he had Glaswegian parents erm
C	would you like me to go and play with
D	no
C	you don't want
F	cos it was they were
G	yeah
F	if they they if he was a weegie
G	a weegie yeah
F	a weegie
G	that but my
B	makes you are potentially English
G	my youngest son was a
F	his mother
G	the that he
D	mm
G	that he could compete with Scotland as well as he could for England because er they
F	a smaller country
F	though there are more people living in London greater London than there are in Scotland
F	but er
unknown_female	I think that goes for most small countries
F	I don't know
G	yeah
F	er
C	are like eating him?
G	it
F	how many people are in Ireland?
F	the republic of Ireland
D	five million probably
unknown_female	five million
unknown_female	hello hello
unknown_female	so six or seven and then
F	but four and a half in New Zealand aren't there?
D	mm more sheep than people there
F	more sheep than people yes
F	so they tell me
D	yeah
unknown_female	they have more cows than people
G	is that that New Zealand?
unknown_female	no
unknown_female	Ireland Ireland
unknown_female	yeah
G	yeah
C	that's cos some people are cows ah
D	that's
G	yeah
D	not very nice
F	no
G	New Zealand has more sheep than people yeah
F	that's right
C	what I didn't even say anyone
F	I know you didn't but erm er
C	there could be like an
unknown_female	an actual half woman half cow
F	okay we've done this
G	I think we have more rats than people
F	oh yes definitely
F	erm and that's in every single city
unknown_female	uhu
F	erm er or if you go to any place
G	or they they have
F	erm
G	them in the countryside
F	and I hate that thought
C	that thought?
F	it's the thought that there are more rats than people living in
D	let's not think
unknown_female	well that's cos they're all
D	let's just not think about the rats
unknown_female	in the sewers and they're all in like
G	mm
F	oh no I still don't
F	really like that thought
B	but that's why there is a relational volume in terms of
F	well just the numbers
B	look quite big
F	just because just because they're littler than us doesn't mean to say that they're there's just more of them
B	does that what there might be numerically more of them but I doubt it might not be in terms of pure volume
unknown_female	yeah
B	more of them
B	but there probably is
D	okay okay
B	both
F	and of course we probably have water rats here
unknown_female	mm?
F	well we probably get
G	you know I mean water rats is a totally different animal erm
F	but we probably have water rats here
unknown_female	I can't remember where I heard this but in some town in Ireland they
F	mm yes
B	there wasn't it caught in the pipe like the
D	in the waste
B	in the waste
unknown_female	they were like the size of a very small dog
F	really?
unknown_female	yeah it was weird
F	how did they get rid of the problem?
unknown_female	I don't know
F	or is the problem still there?
unknown_female	I I just heard of it somewhere
B	there was a just a story
unknown_female	I think it was
B	in the media about this very big rat that somebody caught
B	or something yes
D	does it?
D	or
B	no no no
unknown_female	no it was actually real though
B	they had they they actually have a picture of it
unknown_female	like some
D	they had a picture of the Virgin Mary on toast?
B	well the Virgin Mary on toast is pretty hard to
F	well she was just like a statue probably
B	well
B	great job
B	so yeah yes
D	oh no
B	oh
D	I'm not going to be able to sleep tonight
B	something like
D	no
unknown_female	had to bring that up
F	no
unknown_female	when while we're at it we we can talk about the ant colony living behind our house
unknown_female	it's not
B	it's
F	it was awful though when I when I was a
unknown_female	that's but that's like
B	it it isn't quite
B	I used to like
D	clean up and
B	ants are very
unknown_female	yeah
B	ordinary they walk in line they're doing stuff they're workers
B	hence since you've seen it then
unknown_female	yeah
G	yeah
G	well the species which will survive everything and survive us all are beetles and cockroaches well er beetles and particularly cockroaches
G	they will
D	oh my gosh
G	er
unknown_female	I remember this conversation
D	yeah I used to kind of see them at night
G	what?
D	in Australia
D	I used to hear the cockroaches they were that big and you could hear them going
F	where was this
G	where was that then?
F	not in our house?
B	in Australia
D	Australia
F	in Australia oh well that's okay
G	yeah
F	cos they have really loads and loads of stuff we don't have
D	yeah
G	poisonous spiders
F	like poisonous snakes and spiders and things
unknown_female	toilet spiders
unknown_female	why did they all end up in Australia?
unknown_female	the that just really disturbs me
B	you wouldn't like move your
unknown_female	I know but like
unknown_female	it's a green spider that lives underneath your toilet
B	and it's isolated evolution and it's
G	really?
unknown_female	in Australia
F	do you mean lives in the pan underneath your toilet or actually underneath the bowl?
D	I don't know whether
B	the erm
unknown_female	er no no like no like on the
F	actually under the
B	well not necessarily like
unknown_female	on the
B	but they do actually have
unknown_female	the toilet
B	like a certain percentage of the
F	yes
B	is poisonous spiders and all of that
F	and it it lives in there
B	poisonous spiders and snakes and all
F	oh oh dear I don't I don't want to use the toilet
B	so they do have an unusual
F	I think I would get a little potty and I'd wee in the potty
B	the
F	that because er
F	that would be much better
F	than having to sit
G	yeah
B	saw different things
F	yeah
B	out there
G	well we have no no poisonous spiders in this country at all
B	maybe poisonous
G	and there's erm
unknown_female	you'd be surprised
unknown_female	I mean some people have like allergies er certain spiders
G	er yeah
unknown_female	and you still have things like like is
unknown_female	the ones that bite
G	no I think
G	I don't think we have any
F	I don't think we have many
G	no but I think
D	we only have little ones that bite a little bit
G	I think it's a good thing
D	but only a sting
G	we have no poisonous
unknown_female	mm
G	er spiders
B	but there are
G	erm
B	false widow spiders but they kind of more or less tend to travel in from
unknown_female	other countries
G	well you er
unknown_female	oh those are the
G	obviously obviously you will get erm some
D	bananas
G	that comes in overseas freight or something like that
D	don't buy bananas
unknown_female	the the the
F	oh bananas
unknown_female	all those creepy ones
B	but I think there are false widows in the UK and Ireland
G	well I I know I've seen I've read categorically that we had no poisonous we we spiders in this country and we we have one
unknown_female	it's like a big fat
B	it's if it bites you it's incredibly painful
G	which is?
B	the false widow
G	oh
B	there's been two cases in Ireland in the last twelve months
F	really?
B	with people getting bitten by false widow spiders
F	and you have you are surrounded by water?
D	mm
B	they come from the Canaries is er somewhere
G	and St Patrick got rid of all the snakes didn't he?
unknown_female	on fruit and things that they ride in on
B	allegedly
F	mm
B	we've no documentary evidence to substantiate that claim
unknown_female	that's why we have strict border control
B	I think we do do we? do we
unknown_female	mm?
B	definitely have no snakes?
D	we definitely have no snakes
unknown_female	you have no snakes
D	we've only got adders and slowworms and things
F	cos cos cos St Patrick
G	no we we and
D	yeah
G	a grass snake
D	we've got well adders
G	a grass snake
D	are grass snakes
G	is a snake
D	yes they're grass snakes
G	but but it's a a non but er the adder is the only stinging snake er
F	yes but I mean
G	either snake
D	it could a small child
G	pardon?
F	if there were lots and lots of snakes in Ireland
G	in this country
D	it could kill a small child
unknown_female	mm
G	and people people
unknown_female	but it probably wouldn't
G	very rarely
unknown_female	it's more of a
G	get stung by adders cos they're very shy
unknown_female	pagan basically
D	I've
G	er well I I've you I'm
unknown_female	it depends on which story
G	when I was at school we
F	listen we used to sing
F	in our church
B	if you type in either into Google you know
C	do you have different
unknown_female	I dunno
C	oh
unknown_female	can't remember what
B	the top ten questions
F	are churches er are schools still quite sort of erm religious?
unknown_female	no
F	no?
unknown_female	well not technically but like
unknown_female	religion classes are still Catholic
unknown_female	the priests still they still
G	the priests
unknown_female	yeah
B	well the
D	well like the end end of year in
unknown_female	yeah
F	mm okay
unknown_female	yeah there's still like masses and stuff
F	mm mm
unknown_female	but technically there's not
unknown_female	technically they're like
unknown_female	so like they say we're a non-religious schools
unknown_female	non-religion
B	but apparently
G	well
B	there were never any snakes in Ireland so this wasn't the
G	well my
unknown_female	yeah that's what I figured
D	but every school asks you though or most schools well actually maybe not yours cos yours is a modern school isn't it?
unknown_female	er no we still have mass
unknown_female	they they probably gonna ask you
D	yeah
unknown_female	you know like every
D	but they er ask whether you're baptised and whether I mean I filled in every single form for
unknown_female	oh
D	it was the old priest quite
unknown_female	it's mostly
unknown_female	dodgy I think it's funny
unknown_female	er primary schools are lot worse for that though
B	see primary schools mostly are run by
F	absolutely
B	like that
B	now it's more it's all like religion
G	well
B	and all that
B	but even in all those schools now religion is just you know you learn about lots of different religions and all about
F	right yes
B	and it
unknown_female	in theory
B	yeah but Christianity in a general sense and the principles of Christianity rather than
unknown_female	I think we have like
B	they still do communions and confirmations and all that
unknown_female	I think we have like three teachers in our school that actually teach
D	oh really?
B	and the secondaries
unknown_female	they always teach you very Catholic religion
unknown_female	no they just well the
B	and the secondary schools are less so
unknown_female	they had like a and prays and
B	there's a most and all the secondary schools are non-religious in terms of patronage
unknown_female	that's what she does
G	yeah
B	but there's still a lot of but to be honest there's still a lot of like like ethos is most schools primary and secondary but
unknown_female	and the history teacher
B	like but
unknown_female	the history teacher
B	where the communions and confirmation
G	yeah
B	it's probably it is not in any way
C	oh
D	no it's not great
B	and it's more like what's surprising is
D	don't let him
B	like
B	I'd say when I grew up
B	when I was like
B	probably ten every family went to mass every Sunday
F	mm mm
B	like now I'd say I don't actually know I'd say one in twenty families I know go to mass on Sunday
unknown_female	I think nan sort of goes at Easter and that's it
B	but er your but your grandmother would be more
D	mm
B	like I'd say only well I dunno one in twenty
D	but they're still busy though
B	one in twenty families
D	they're really busy on a Sunday
unknown_female	mm?
D	packed I thought
B	it's no not as
D	well when we go past it's full of cars on a Sunday
B	that was on a Saturday the see the Saturday mass I mean that was always that's much popular people don't have to get up on Sunday
D	oh maybe it was Saturday
B	but but they've got a mad thing for justifying it well I think this is it
F	oh yes well you used to I mean I I
B	it's like
F	when I was still living in
D	did you? really?
F	yes because it it was perfectly good
D	yeah
F	secondary school in the town but it was Protestant erm but erm but the Saturday mass come in there and everybody loved it
F	yes yes and I was in the twenties
F	erm so it's erm er you could just you could you could you could get it over with
D	you could lie in on a Sunday
D	mm
B	apparently
F	granny
B	there are no snakes in New Zealand or Madagascar
unknown_female	in Madagascar?
B	or Madagascar
F	oh Madagascar and
B	they say like
F	Ireland
B	snakes the snakeless islands and that
F	right
B	what they're saying as well is that the internet knows that's how I know all this
B	but it's like saying like apparently the less
G	well the
G	Madagascar whole flora is completely different from
B	well that's cos again there's probably have isolated evolution like Australia
G	extreme extreme evolution is is is been an
D	be great to go there I'd love to go there
B	but er
C	how are you?
D	sounds interesting
B	apparently in the last ice age Ireland and most of England were too cold for any snakes and the land bridge between Ireland and England flooded before the snakes actually repopulated from the south so but they
D	oh I see
B	but they were still able to get into England but not into Ireland cos of there was
G	we we still had that bridge
B	yeah yes cos
G	er yeah
B	so er
F	we have snakes
B	apparently
F	little grass snakes that aren't poisonous and one snake an adder that is but I've never seen an adder
D	I think er I've seen
G	I have cos
D	they've got zigzags
G	with the
unknown_female	it would be more in the like
D	they're like the ones you draw at school
G	we used to play erm in the garden on sort of the
unknown_female	oh really?
D	yeah they're just like that
unknown_female	a stripy stripy adder?
D	yes the adder adder
unknown_female	that's weird why do like kids just know that a snake
D	I don't know
unknown_female	would be like that?
unknown_female	I don't know
unknown_female	cos I've never seen that like not even in pictures or anything I don't remember that drawing things like
G	I I mean I've lived in Africa as well and we once had a
F	they cut
G	the the end of the cut they had ten
D	ten?
G	er which had been living in in in the grass from in front of our house
D	mm
G	erm I mean if you leave them alone they they they won't bother you
D	that's a lot to just be hanging around though
F	and I'm sure they were all related
F	when we found the
D	dead
B	Madagascar now just not poisonous ones
B	erm
F	erm erm yes it's it's it's wonderful now people can just tap into
B	and get a load of information
F	er
B	that's totally wrong
G	er the the the the the
unknown_female	it's not always wrong
G	you can't have a decent argument in the pub any more
B	but you can because there are most information you'll find two answers saying the exact
B	fuels more
G	well
B	more drunken banter
unknown_female	you usually go with the one that is not Wikipedia
D	Wikipedia they tested Wikipedia
unknown_female	Wikipedia has got better though
D	yeah no they they could actually test it against the Encyclopaedia Britannica
G	yeah that's
F	and get it wrong
D	yeah yeah and erm
B	using a scientific measure
D	yeah
D	and it's pretty accurate it's pretty
G	er well I I use Wikipedia a lot
D	I love it
G	but something in a couple of our books
D	yeah
G	but erm er that was some time ago er you know and it's I'm sure it's got better but erm
D	oh
G	the er
F	is it just people can write in?
G	but the academics will not let you quote Wikipedia
unknown_female	no that's
unknown_female	because it's like anyone can go in and edit it
G	well that's the problem that
F	that you
unknown_female	so you always need to verify the information through a secondary source
G	but that's exactly the problem but yeah and it's er
B	as much as a fact can be a fact
G	the throne and that kind of thing
G	pure facts er you just I mean if somebody's telling you the Edward the first came to the throne in the fifteenth century you know you can just pick your thing out of the pocket and say you don't have to argue with it you just pick your your thing out and say sorry mate it was the
D	yeah
G	or
D	yeah
G	came to the throne end of you know it was
B	it's the
F	I think it's wonderful cos actually
G	that was a well yes the
F	on his phone and tell me all the stars in the sky
B	well you can get your phone to kind of like
D	mm
B	with apps on it that
D	mm yeah
B	then the way you're holding your phone
B	and tell you what your
D	it's really nice I think
F	mm I've forgotten what he said of course but erm
B	yeah but throw him out the
F	it was a good start I think yeah
B	throw him out the bush for a night when he's
unknown_female	he's saying you can get
B	with no phone
unknown_female	apps specifically geared toward astronomy so you can use the camera on your phone and just take
F	right yeah
unknown_female	a picture of the sky
F	yeah
unknown_female	and it tells you it'll tell you what constellations you've got there
F	yes
D	but of the moment
F	erm erm
B	the constellations are well because a lot of the constellations and the stars are
F	do they move?
B	millions of light years away it'll be because
F	mm
F	no I mean it's a big
B	geographully
F	there's a big there's a big space out there
B	geographically
F	bigger than we are
B	er we have a lot of years
D	there's a
B	well there's the one that's the W but the stars are not local to each other
unknown_female	that's Cassiopeia
B	yeah I mean
F	oh they they're not
B	just
F	near each other they're just
B	they're not near each other they're just
F	yeah they appear
B	they're just off in the same direction from us
B	so like
F	that's right
B	those pictures
G	that's right
B	almost like but it's
unknown_female	but but there was
B	you might as well call them Bill and Bob and
unknown_female	as a way of navigating it on earth though
B	that's more you know
B	that's different yes
G	I mean
G	the stars in Orion mm and in the sky they bear no relation to each
D	it's how we see them
F	well the moon is the moon isn't it?
D	it's made of cheese mum
B	well
F	erm
F	oh
D	new planets
unknown_female	but mum it's
D	their computer place in
B	no no I haven't seen that
D	yeah
F	it's fascinating really
B	yeah technically it's
F	yeah
B	but like it's not that like you know
unknown_female	no
D	I know it's an algorithm been done
D	it's still quite cool isn't it? I can imagine
B	uhu and I find the
unknown_female	and I can imagine astrophysics is the most
unknown_female	mm
unknown_female	interesting career
F	now what is
unknown_female	you know
F	astrophysics?
C	I say how are you? you say I'm fine thank you
C	I am
B	astronomy and and physics
G	well it's the two er both
B	it's the physics of
F	oh right the physics
B	of big things
F	but but the the physics of the stars?
unknown_female	it's like how the planets and like the
B	but it's stars and
unknown_female	what
F	right
unknown_female	kind of keeps them together
F	and er does it I mean does it talk about the sort of gases they're made up of or rocks or anything?
unknown_female	no
F	no?
G	no that would
unknown_female	that would
B	for stars yes
unknown_female	for stars yes but not for like
F	mm
unknown_female	that would be more chemistry
D	well I guess it depends if it's kind of dealing with different areas
unknown_female	mm
D	my friend who does it he is in
C	I am good
B	it's it's
D	but it but that
unknown_female	spectromody spectrology
F	tropothy
F	I erm
unknown_female	do you wanna spell it?
unknown_female	spectrology?
B	no
unknown_female	tropothy
B	looks like
unknown_female	spectrosity
B	I can get it written I can
unknown_female	spectroscopic
F	I wonder how you get into that kind of job though I mean I
D	maths
F	wonder what you start as
D	being good at maths
F	no but I wonder what you start as
unknown_female	now there's a direct course it's like well
F	oh there is a course in astronomy and would you go to the astronomy?
G	you you would you you'd have to have a strong physics background
D	yeah physics maths
G	and erm
unknown_female	they do it together
unknown_female	yeah as a actual
unknown_female	in
F	right
unknown_female	and it's physics and astrophysics so
F	oh right right
unknown_female	there's no separate
F	physics and astrophysics
unknown_female	yeah
F	oh right so you don't get
unknown_female	I don't think there's any separate physics course
F	the astronomy bit
unknown_female	either which is kind of stupid
F	erm we just have to erm become stargazers
B	spectroscopy
unknown_female	spectroscopy
F	wonderful
[ANNOTATION]	there is an astronomy-related course	Entailment
unknown_female	refute that
F	say that back again
F	erm
G	there's an awful lot they still don't know about
F	oh I know
G	I mean
F	it's marvellous
B	considering how far away things are there's an awful lot they do know
G	I I mean the whole business of black the dark matter is it is just complete
[ANNOTATION]	science has knowledge of everything in the world	Contradiction
D	yeah it's interesting though isn't it? it's really interesting
unknown_female	they know some stuff
G	well well they know they
B	well they know a lot
G	they know what's got to be there but they know that well that only the actual world we say physical or whatever we say is only about twenty percent of everything which is in the universe because otherwise gravity wouldn't work the way it does and erm
D	yeah
C	how are you? I am good how are you?
G	and so there's got to be eighty percent or I think it is of the er of the er stuff in the world has got to has got to be invisible to us completely
unknown_female	well yeah but still
B	you mean the universe?
unknown_female	we've found some of them
G	yeah sorry the universe
unknown_female	they've found some of that visible stuff so like we know about
B	yes
G	yeah
B	yeah but no
unknown_female	things like gravitons
B	they or they don't know what dark matter is they only know there's has to be something there because all their other models say the volume or mass of the universe must be X and they only can see twenty percent of the
B	so eighty percent of something must be there
F	but we haven't seen it yes
B	but we have no idea what it is
G	I know it but I mean it's all in the room now you know
D	it's all the astrophysics going don't
G	passing through us and whatever it is
D	don't say too much cos otherwise we'll be out of a job
D	we've gotta to keep the
D	eighty percent of stuff
unknown_female	we're about twenty percent of their
unknown_female	well it only is for a little while longer
B	well cos then like some guy made this
G	cos you're I mean
unknown_female	I think no one knows how big the universe is
G	there's an awful lot of but
unknown_female	no but that it's really big
F	but it's like
F	but it's not just one universe there's
G	the genes
F	loads of universes isn't there?
unknown_female	yeah but you can just like
G	but er
D	possibly
B	uhu
G	life it it's it's extraordinary
D	mm yeah it's very interesting
F	but and the mad thing is that there are loads and loads and loads of stars still to be it's not as if we know about everything
D	yeah
F	cos the more knowledge that's piled on you think well they can't get they must come to an end of it you know
G	well
G	I think I've heard some people saying that that
G	actually that has happened with chemistry
G	er but I don't know whether you
unknown_female	they said the same thing about physics
G	do they?
B	well they do still
unknown_female	about a hundred and fifty years ago and again before that and it's just like people have come along that have refuted that kind of statement a lot so it's probably not the best
G	well well I
G	you what you're saying is that
B	I think chemistry is funny cos it's kind of that bridge between physics and biology and it's
G	mm
B	so it
B	but there's so much a lot of what happens in chemistry
G	but
B	does quite mm yeah
G	but but apparently
G	is
unknown_female	that's why they make more and it's just the elements on
G	er that yeah
unknown_female	on earth that they know of
G	no they reckon
B	but no well
G	they they reckon they know everything which is in the universe that
unknown_female	and it's like anything that's hubris
G	well
G	er the well you may well be right er you may well be proved right I mean this is the point
G	which you were saying basically people have said that in the past and then they could have
D	but I suppose it depends you could say that
G	they may maybe they're wrong
D	you could say for example
B	well but there are degrees of confidence
D	well I suppose yeah
G	yeah
D	I think they are
G	but but but well what I
D	think in the future that actually it is round
G	well er it it is round because we can test
B	well technically it's not round it's oblate but
G	you
D	yeah
G	one way and the the world's down there and you get back to the same place
[ANNOTATION]	People believed that the earth was square until 1630.	Neutral
F	I
G	but actually the idea that Columbus er it well
B	well he didn't yeah
G	it was
G	but it but way before Columbus and
B	but the Greeks calculated
G	er it it it went back to the Arabs you know of erm the in sort of twelfth century Arabs er
G	the they argued that the world was round
F	are you alright?
G	yeah they knew
G	they
B	apparently apparently they did
G	did they?
[ANNOTATION]	It was initially the Arabs that believed the earth wasn't squared.	Entailment
D	just get this
B	yes I dunno if like it was like as you said it was well known and then kind of different parts would become more
D	I'm going to
G	well you see no the Greeks it was the
unknown_female	erm it probably never developed
G	but the Greeks were
unknown_female	any further than
G	were very dependent on Ptolemy
B	sorry?
G	and and Ptolemy was a flat earther
B	no but there was apparently like for like I dunno a whole like a whole there's Euclid and like how far away was he?
[ANNOTATION]	The Greeks never believed the earth was squared.	Contradiction
G	well he's a mathematician and
B	yeah yeah but how I dunno
G	I don't think he was er
unknown_female	you'd be surprised
[ANNOTATION]	Euclid was an ancient Greek mathematician born in the 5th BC century.	Neutral
B	but but
G	well yeah I know
B	sorry
G	I know well the
B	mm
G	were astonishing er and then they they worked they worked from Greek philosophy
unknown_female	I think
[ANNOTATION]	Greeks were not philosophers	Contradiction
A	no I've been listening
G	erm erm
F	I just think it's wonderful that
G	so
F	there's so much they I don't know about
G	is it what science do you do in?
F	you know I don't know about the
G	erm but we what's er?
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker F doesn't know a lot about physics.	Neutral
G	and you get a in your exams
unknown_female	I did physics and chemistry
G	physics and chemistry yes
B	cos you cos your subjects are unusual
B	especially for a girl
unknown_female	you
B	she
B	she did take technical graphics as well as
F	how many subjects did you have to do then?
unknown_female	seven
F	seven of them? that's quite a lot
unknown_female	we all do English maths and Irish provided you
F	mm
unknown_female	you don't have exemptions
F	yeah
unknown_female	and then I did
B	well tell them what DCG is
F	DCG
unknown_female	designing communication graphics it's like architecture
F	oh right right
unknown_female	and design and all that stuff
F	mm
G	yeah
F	but but is it through through erm the computer
unknown_female	er
F	and the computer graphics or?
unknown_female	part of it is and part of it isn't
F	oh right yes
G	well where did you take this?
unknown_female	mm?
G	when did you take those exams?
unknown_female	er that's June and July
B	two months ago
B	so
G	and er you they
B	next week or two weeks' time
G	two weeks' time?
unknown_female	yeah
B	so that's so that they are like
G	good luck
B	so they are like
B	they're like
B	so that's the end of her
B	secondary school
B	entire cycle like their like the biggest worst most horrible exams
B	you'll ever have to do the ones at university are easier no
B	no I mean they're just less kind
unknown_female	stressful
B	yes
B	you have to do them all in like two terms
unknown_female	the Leaving Cert is an extremely flawed system
B	but er
G	but do does anyone in Ireland do Baccalaureate?
unknown_female	mm?
G	does anyone in Ireland do the Baccalaureate?
B	what's that?
unknown_female	that's the
F	the French
G	that's the basically it's the it's the European exam we have mainly people take A level
B	yeah
G	but erm we have a number of schools which do Baccalaureate instead and the difference is that for A levels you would normally take three at most four or five subjects Baccalaureate you can erm so you you can drop maths you can drop English you can drop you know you can drop erm virtually
F	the Baccalaureate is broader
G	but but Baccalaureate er is broader
F	yeah and more subjects
G	you have to carry on with more subjects
F	mm mm
G	and erm
G	and the
unknown_female	it's more specialised then?
G	the A level is more specialised
unknown_female	mm
B	oh
G	erm
F	mm mm
F	mm
G	but we we have a long tradition of er early specialisation erm which I am not I don't approve of personally I erm
D	I'm just going to
unknown_female	mm?
B	do you wanna go upstairs? okay now I'd better bring this guy up and change him cos he's half falling asleep
F	he's falling to sleep
G	you're you're
F	he is
unknown_female	what?
G	you're really tired aren't you?
G	you're really tired
G	yeah
B	will you help bring out the plates and stuff?
F	now you know
G	er yeah
unknown_female	we haven't closed them since we've got here
F	mm mm
G	mm mm mm mm mm
D	thank you
D	mm
F	mm just let me know what to do with this
unknown_female	I was
C	yeah I was
G	erm
C	talking to
F	mm
C	mum
unknown_female	yeah
F	that was lovely cake really nice dear
unknown_female	nice
F	nice chat
F	nice chat
D	did
F	mm
D	well the girls are going back and I should probably leave about between half nine and ten
C	in the morning?
D	the yeah in the morning
B	er
D	maybe a bit later
C	I taught
D	did you really?
C	yeah he was very he was very happy to learn
D	was he?
F	night girls
unknown_female	night
unknown_female	good night
F	good night boys
C	alright then
D	so have one now
unknown_female	have you got some towels up here?
F	yeah there are towels up there
unknown_female	yeah
D	okay yeah
D	and could I have a towel and
D	oh okay can you bring down these
