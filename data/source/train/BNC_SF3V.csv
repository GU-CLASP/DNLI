A	we've got erm

C	okay mm
A	you know but you can
C	mm
A	look down from the offices and from the landings into the main lobby

B	ah
A	three or four different levels it's oh my god and actually I'd taken a sleeping pill the night before and I hadn't had enough sleep
A	and then fall flat on my face at any moment it was and we did something like six songs
A	please god let it be over I'm gonna fall over at any moment
A	really really horrible ordeal
C	yeah
A	not fun at all
C	no shame
A	and because we were so weak as well they had to bring a whole

A	got choirs of like a hundred strong
C	oh yeah huge that was
A	and all the people who work for
C	yeah yeah
A	of whom have got like a hundred people in their choir
C	mm
A	and they had to come up in a car to beef us up because there weren't enough of us singing and we were sitting there of course they were late
B	and then they march in and take control cos they're
A	I know I know thank god and
B	far better than everybody else

A	oh really?
B	it's they're so
A	oh really?
C	Chris Chris Packham's got a link with us apparently work he does he does stuff for the applied sciences people
A	oh right?
A	I
C	he's
A	doesn't like human beings prefers animals to humans
C	yeah
A	but
A	cos she was always on about tits oh the tits are nesting and
B	oh she's got
A	oh yeah
C	but that was that was that was quite a good
B	yes yeah
A	Monin Bonin erm
A	Lisa Bonin something
B	no
C	no I don't have I've no idea what she's called
A	Laura
C	but it was a it was a jolly good programme I liked that
A	did you see the one where they had a series of three of her cats
C	I saw some of it where they could track
B	yeah see where they go yeah
A	on those cats
C	that's it
A	that was very funny and they they were they had the the urban cats in Bristol where
C	they were good
A	this family found out that their cat was menacing all all the other cats in the street and there's this other cat down the street that was so nervous and its owners couldn't work out why this cat was having a nervous breakdown
B	it was beaten up every day
A	every time it put its nose outside
C	but it got it got battered
A	outside
A	jumped on it
A	so oh no it's our cat ha ha ha
B	what can you do about that that's awful?
A	no I know well you can't do anything can you?
C	it's the same as
A	but then there was the farm cats
B	mm
A	but they did the same along this hedge over that wall
B	yeah
A	they but they all they did their own route
B	down that field
A	every day
A	so you know ginger tom went this way along this hedge over here he did six miles he came back home again this one went over the it was strange cos they were either gingers or torties these ones
B	mm
A	so half all the girls were torties and all the boys were gingers
B	well
A	that's true
B	no it's what you want out of them really you know
C	different
A	they are different kinds of creature
B	well quite a lot of people do
A	you're quite fit and you have exercise
C	hence my brother being very successful with his business
A	I know perhaps I should do dog walking
A	so actually everybody round our way actually
B	why have a dog?
A	why have a dog?
B	so
A	has she got?
C	she's got a very old dog
B	yeah
A	oh they do
B	so
A	don't Labradors have bad hips?
B	got one ear that she's
A	oh really?
B	yes
A	I'm slightly worried about the cat because it puts its head on one side looks very endearing but I thought actually perhaps it's got neurological problems
B	might've had a stroke
A	yes already at the age of eighteen months
B	but er
A	I I'm actually waiting
A	waiting for
B	yes cos
A	the dog?
B	yeah the dog is yeah erm dog's probably one of
A	who isn't fond of
A	ah
B	and he goes with her he walks
A	that's
B	he walks her every so often as well
A	does he?
B	it's yeah
A	oh that's nice
B	especially now
A	oh is he?
B	yeah
A	is he? what?
B	yeah
A	that's very sensible
B	well indeed and I expect her German's coming along quite well as well is it? or not?
A	no well actually that was the reason
A	she's not very
B	mm
A	so erm
B	we usually screw up the first one so
A	well
A	yeah I know well look at me basket case
A	or
B	yeah
A	there's the when I had CBT the guy that
B	why
A	I don't he just unless he was just saying that really
B	well cos even with three you're gonna have conflict aren't you? cos you you know one's the oldest one's the youngest and one's
A	and you have separate roles
B	yes
A	mind you
B	you know you're not comparing one with the other are you?
A	no mind you actually erm
B	overexcited
A	overexcited and
B	mm yes the croquet?
A	for the croquet so I found some of those bamboo hoops to do the hoops and
A	and blatantly
B	well there was a certain when the boys were small there was a certain amount of one-upmanship
A	mm mm
B	always wanted to get one over on
A	mm
B	like having to say to him you know he's going to be bigger than you one day you really you know be careful because he is going to be bigger than you one day
A	and has he paid them back or he still
A	yeah
B	no but he wouldn't've tried cos it doesn't occur to him it's
A	no
B	no he's not like that
A	that with the what the
B	oh god
A	Pokemon
B	oh bloody hell
A	that was dreadful
B	yeah
A	that was terrible
B	well yeah I know but er yeah
A	no
B	positive he doesn't want to beat other people
A	no well there are some unpaid debts though really
A	the truth be known
B	oh yeah seen them
A	and there's always like a trillion
B	oh what's it called?
A	at bedtime can't remember what it's called
B	oh yeah
A	I thought it was Stephen Fry
B	was it not David Walliams?
A	oh no David Walliams yes David Walliams
B	about the gangster granny?
A	was it Gangster Granny?
A	no it wasn't no it was about a grandpa rather than a granny no I haven't no I haven't got onto
B	there's there's Mr Stink
A	wasn't Mr Stink no it's definitely about grandpa
A	and grandpa imagining himself as a First World War flying ace or had been a First World War flying ace or something
B	oh right
A	yes
B	especially when you have
A	well I did but I did wonder
B	but he's hugely popular in in the children's bestselling lists he's
A	really?
B	and then you get
A	mm
B	oh oh no well no I think there's a certain amount of appeal actually I don't they're not they're all
B	you can see where he's coming from but you've got you've also got
A	but there must be people
B	Lampard writing children's
A	what? Frank Lampard?
B	Frank Lampard apparently
A	oh really
B	in inverted commas writing children's stories about football
A	really
B	yes and apparently Chris Hoy
C	yes he has
A	well that's cycling
B	yes
A	cycling stories mm
B	yes
C	mm
B	so
B	I don't know about Chris Hoy whether he's any good at that kind of thing or not it remains to be seen
C	who is who is who is married to Prince Andrew?
A	oh yeah
C	she she did didn't she?
A	little Budgie Budgie the Helicopter
B	oh yeah Budgie
C	Budgie the Helicopter
A	yeah
A	and it is difficult to know because I think you get your break that way when people sort of say well oh gosh it was done all on my own talent and you think yeah but you know somebody listened to you in the first place you're son or daughter of X
C	well yeah
A	so how would you get your break otherwise? there must be people who are more talented who just don't get a break
C	no
B	well J K Rowling got rejected by
A	I know
B	don't know how many publishers first
A	yeah
B	and then you know you open up book one and you read the first sentence and you think pff
C	mm
A	well I I mean I think it's so derivative
C	C S Lewis
A	C S Lewis yeah
B	yeah but you don't expect your average ten-year-old to know anything about either of those people do you? it's news to all of them
A	well yeah but then that that's what I when I think to myself do you know what? I need to kind of do something I think well what's the trend that's coming up? what is? who is there that's out of fashion that's
C	yeah
A	and kind of turn into a modern version of said same thing?
C	mm
A	I mean like you know for example just been reading Stella Gibbons you know
C	mm
A	is the equivalent modern equivalent of
B	like with
A	who?
B	George George Nicolson that's Louise Rennison has a character called George Nicolson who would who's who would be the er equivalent
A	oh right?
B	Bridget Jones
A	mm
B	well I wanted purple curtains upstairs and could I find any purple fabric?
A	no
B	no I blooming couldn't because it was completely out of
A	yes
B	kilter
A	and when I was trying to do our shower
B	it would be so easy wouldn't it? with all your the only hole you have is the plughole at the bottom and a door at the front
A	yeah and the hole
B	yes
A	the hole where the electric shower comes through
B	yes
A	where the pipe electric and everything else is just a cubicle a whole cubicle
B	yeah with no holes
A	no holes
B	with no seams
A	no gaps no seams no no leaks no anything and you just you just have it delivered on a lorry and you just slot it into the corner of the room
B	there still isn't I don't think is there?
A	there is
B	is there? somebody's invented it
A	yeah they somebody has invented them now and they've also invented these wedi board
B	oh yes
A	has invented something
B	has he? what's he invented?
A	he has invented circular kitchen rolls
B	I'm sorry circular kitchen rolls?
A	circular kitchen rolls yes
B	how? how does a circular kitchen roll work?
A	well you have you have a round thing
B	but they won't be in a cone will they? they'll be in a they'll be in like a stack of pancakes they can't be like a cone
A	no no cos they're in a cone
B	they can't be in a cone how can they be in a?
A	and they've got
B	so is there
A	yes yes
B	okay
A	yes two hundred witch hats on top of each other with a little plastic cone on top to keep them in place
B	like a box of tissues
[ANNOTATION]	circular kitchen rolls are not common	Entailment
A	and then you unfold it and it's yes and it's circular
B	what's the? what is the advantage of it being circular?
A	ah you can transport twenty percent more kitchen rolls in the same
C	space
A	in the same space on the lorry
C	oh
A	so it's
C	good
[ANNOTATION]	circular kitchen rolls make it less efficient	Contradiction
A	really good for the environment
C	it's like
B	what? but it circular is no way better than square
C	it's like
B	when you're transporting things
A	yes it is
B	how can it be?
A	because the packs are
B	cos you fill all the corners if it's square and you can't fill all the corners if it's circular
A	no because it comes like this it's wrapped so they're all round
A	so they all
[ANNOTATION]	square packing is more efficient than circular packing	Contradiction
C	mm
A	squash up together
B	but they don't all squash up together you're still gonna have spaces in between
[ANNOTATION]	circular packing leaves spaces in between	Entailment
A	apparently you can
C	it's
A	sorry? what?
A	Kit Kats?
C	you know they changed the way they did KitKats instead of
B	I'm not sure it's true
A	what? the Kit Kats or the paper?
B	the paper
[ANNOTATION]	square packing more efficient	Entailment
C	on the paper
A	ah
B	yeah so instead of having a bit of paper that shape and the Kit Kat square like that they turned it
C	in the middle
B	it turned at an angle
A	ah
C	you turn at an angle and you can do it with smaller
B	and you fold over the corners instead
C	with less
A	yeah
C	paper
A	although the reason I won't buy Munchies from the shop
A	is because they're always unwrapped at the end so they've always been exposed and you think mm who's been touching those? so you have to be careful with things like
B	isn't that the same with
C	eat the eat the Munchies
B	fruit gums and
C	I'm very fond of Munchies
B	those sorts of things?
A	Munchies are good
B	Pastilles Fruit Pastilles with all the sugar on
C	I can't remember when I last had them
A	mm no then they take your fillings out
B	well that's not the point though is it? it's
A	well apparently apparently according to
B	are they they're the paper ones that absorb liquid aren't they?
A	they
A	yeah like kitchen rolls
B	so
A	yeah yeah it's about erm
B	well that's where the
A	it's probably about as big as that it's probably about as that
B	that's not very big
A	because it's
B	so how big are they when you spread them out the palm of your hand?
A	they're like that
B	okay so is he going to make his millions out of this?
A	well
A	who who had this idea and then he went to somebody else on the train who was a financier
A	and the
B	shouldn't er shouldn't he have gone to Harrods?
A	well I went I went to Tesco's
B	wouldn't it be better if he'd gone to Harrods?
A	I went to Tesco's specifically to buy these things I wanted to see what they were like
B	well there you see if you'd gone if you'd gone to Harrods you'd be spending twice as much on each one
A	I know
B	like that bloke with his chocolate
C	it's where he
A	well you need to yeah you need to
B	well you know I think there's an awful lot of business done on fag breaks you know?
A	yes that's true
B	people people people spend fifteen or twenty minutes you know right I'll meet you outside at eleven o'clock and spend twenty minutes on a fag break while everybody else is still slogging away doing the boring stuff
A	yeah
B	and they're all
A	when I was when I was a trainer you know you always you make friends outside with the other smokers
B	there's a
A	yes
B	exclusive
A	so you have you know so you've got chums by the time you start your training session you've made some chums already and they're on your side cos you've had this illicit relationship with them outside
B	yes I'm quite tempted
A	yeah
B	join with these things
C	join in
A	I'm sure they'd know of that
A	yes that's true
B	you're doing all the work and they're
A	no but they're
B	networking
A	they're slaves
B	well they might be but actually in some case there are advantages to
A	mm
B	where nobody else
A	well I have erm
B	cos you wouldn't just go out to the corridor and stand for twenty minutes would you?
A	no
B	or hanging out with them at least
A	yeah although these days it
A	well yes probably
B	I don't know I think there's a
A	it depends what which age group you're in actually
C	yeah young people smoke like mad especially young girls
A	I know and they take drugs and they
B	it depends what your opportunities are doesn't it? you know those weren't opportunities when we were
A	well I don't know I do get worried because erm I was saying to
B	oh yeah you get tanked up first before you go out
A	yeah yeah
B	cos it's too expensive to drink out
A	yeah yeah
A	and he fell in with this whole pile of women from Liverpool
B	oh dear
A	who were community activists they were working class community activist women from Liverpool who were
A	anyway erm they were at this conference and they were all in the residential block and they had brought their bottle of vodka with them in their luggage so they were
A	when you're drunk and it's just like well no they didn't actually find it very endearing when you used this word
B	there are no circumstances under which that's endearing
A	I can't
A	well yes I did but I thought it was perfectly alright well no it actually wasn't perfectly alright cos they've now made a complaint against you and you were on duty and you were working for us
B	yes
A	and you can't just go to conferences and turn up in somebody's bedroom at one o'clock in the morning drunk and accuse somebody of being a slag this is not right well no they thought it was fine
A	I says no it's not it's you're working for us
A	yes
B	or whether you've had a drink or not
A	then
C	it's it's probably not a good
C	not a good
A	and
C	place to be unless you're a gay bloke
A	no
C	and then you might get away with it
A	mm
A	every time you know he got into trouble
A	he would turn up to a meeting and he'd say
A	so
C	oh when it's all
A	sort of shop stewardy sort of thing and erm he was around for ages like please got let him get a new job let him get a new job let him go away and then erm he did get a new job hooray hooray and then I gave him a reference and was like mm okay I have to make something up on this reference
A	so I gave him this reference and then I met somebody at a conference about eighteen months later said ah yes
A	and he's very very combative and when you sit down and try and talk to him about what you're supposed to be doing he gets his notebook out with his pencil and says right what have you got to say to me? so like oh no he doesn't really does he really? oh my word
A	mm was he like that working for you? when he worked for you?
B	oh no
A	no perfectly alright
A	yeah I know
C	who are the academics running it?
A	I don't know it's Lancaster University
C	they've always been very strong linguistic
A	and erm Cambridge University Press
C	mm
A	I don't know who's in charge of the project
B	what is it they're listening for?
B	what's the point?
A	I don't know erm
A	and about erm idiom and
C	the corpus is a way of er of seeing what the current language really is
A	mm
C	and because computers can manage huge huge piles of data you can you can collect all of this stuff
A	mm
B	they've been doing it with five hundred words actually haven't they? the writing competition the
A	oh right
B	the kiddies' writing competition every year they actually do a bit of analysis on erm all the
C	mm
A	oh right okay
B	mum is up there most
A	oh really?
B	yes
C	mm
A	oh really?
B	oh yes
A	was it you who was telling me that somebody
A	I've written this story cos I've been told to?
B	yeah
A	my teacher made me do it
B	yes definitely
A	so I'm sabotaging it
B	they made me do it
C	mm
A	what frequency?
C	mm
A	oh of words?
C	or you can do it on individual words and
A	mm mm?
C	you can do it on runs of text as well so if you're looking for expressions you can actually
B	mm mm
C	and collocations a whole range of different things
A	very interesting
C	mm
A	but very scientific really
A	but not my kind of research projects I wouldn't be
C	no it's just stats really
A	mm
C	but
A	well somebody
C	both
A	mm
B	well the computer does the totting up doesn't it? but there's no there's no answers unless somebody's interpreting it
A	mm
C	there's also stuff like
A	mm?
C	if you're looking at a much more subjective approach to to to what the language is about
A	mm
B	the other thing we need to do is chew loudly
A	mm?
B	cos if you ever listen to the Archers if they're at meals time they're all
A	ah
A	oh I hate that
B	and talking with their mouth full because obviously it's meal time you see
A	I so hate that
B	yes
C	mm
A	yeah
B	we've got someone in the sound booth going
A	and scraping
A	coconut shells across a piece of erm
B	well
A	yes
A	yes how exciting I don't know do you listen to Radio Four? I can't bear
B	I used to a long time ago not any more
C	not any more I listen to Radio Four Extra because it's frivolous
A	and I don't I can't I can't bear the thought of listening to what's his what who's that very objectionable man?
C	I dunno
B	don't listen to Radio Four any more so can't help you with that one
A	oh right erm
B	oh right
C	oh John Humphrys?
A	mm
C	oh blimey
A	what an objectionable man he is
B	oh he is he never lets you finish your sentence
A	no
B	it's very rare that he actually achieves anything sensible
A	and all these people just talking talking talking
B	there was erm
A	mm
B	who just thought basically that the world'd go could could go to hell
A	mm
B	er and it didn't matter what energy resources you used and what
C	as long as you made a profit
B	what you what you dug up
A	oh
B	yes exactly and erm and he just he just John Humphrys kept handing him more rope and he hanged himself quite thoroughly actually
A	oh really?
B	got to the end of that and you and you thought
C	shouldn't've said that
A	but then actually they should do that more often give people their own rope to do
C	mm
A	rather than just harangue them and harry them and
B	no but half of it's lies that's the trouble
A	mm
B	and people can't distinguish what's lies and what's the truth
A	very difficult
B	that
A	yes your friend didn't take kindly to me yesterday
C	she's from Cornwall
A	I can't remember what I said I think it was about having erm customs officials in
B	in Calais?
A	in Calais and she started looking at me as if I was about to attack her
A	last time we went
A	he got he got stopped and pulled over and questioned
A	yeah like who are you? where have you been? how long have you been abroad? is this your car?
B	do you belong here in the first place?
A	yeah it's like oh my god
B	ah Jewish as well eh?
A	mm
C	yeah
A	well
C	that's alright then
A	he looked more like an Arab than a Jew actually with his beard and his tan
C	had a load of fun at Prague airport once
A	mm?
C	having having an Arab name and a beard
A	you had an Arab name and a beard?
C	mm
A	oh?
C	no just one
A	why were you travelling under a false name then?
C	mm cos that was my name it was the name on the passport as well
A	oh you've got more than one passport?
C	no I just alternate
A	do you?
C	mm
A	that's very suspicious
C	very much yeah
A	you sure you're not under surveillance?
C	my passport never works on machine if that's any guide but a lot of people's don't do they?
A	what? so you have to go over to the to the cubicle and
C	mm
A	ah
C	a completely different name
A	and this is because?
C	I was married to an Arab
A	weren't you? are are you a Muslim now or something?
C	I haven't been Muslim for years
A	well no but I mean
B	only when you don't use your left hand when you're eating of course
A	oh my god he's not using his left hand
B	as demonstrated here and now
A	he's not using his left hand when he's eating
B	yeah
A	do you do that all the time?
B	yes
A	I've never noticed
C	yeah I do
B	what's that got to do with it?
C	you're not very up on your Sunnah are you?
B	no
A	no probably not
C	mm
B	I confess
A	have to put your left shoe on first
C	put your right shoe on first
A	oh really?
C	mm
A	how exciting
C	the least of it
B	it's
C	oh yes
A	do you have lucky days or something or bad luck or good luck or?
C	no no
A	or is it just respectful?
C	mm Sunni
A	erm so hang on a second I
A	so it's not a what your name would be if it was in Arabic? it's an alternative name that what you took when you became a Muslim?
C	no
A	oh
B	for the purpose of the tape
A	how exciting but for the purpose of the tape that you're a native English speaker and that you were brought up in this country and that English is your first language?
C	I'm from
A	cos otherwise it's not valid
C	mm
A	mm mm?
A	mm
B	oh they
A	have two
C	no no cos I had one National Insurance number so
A	ah
C	so there's no problem there
A	you only get half your pension though cos this other bloke will get have the other half
C	my pension's worth tuppence so don't really worry about that
C	I was
A	my pension's quite respectable actually and I
C	mm
A	it's actually turned out to be quite a respectable amount
B	well
A	oh
B	she's gonna have to stop contributing to hers otherwise she's gonna be taxed too much
A	yeah
C	yes yeah yeah yeah
A	she's got over a million pounds in her pension pot
C	so this is
A	how extraordinary
B	god if only
C	and
A	can't you just stop paying into your
C	I oh no I don't know the complexities of it but I
A	I mean surely you could just stop contributing
A	I mean if you've got er your own scheme if you're self-employed
B	well well well presumably you don't
C	I
A	mm
B	mm
A	what's gonna happen to you when you're old? what do you need to think about before you retire? sort of thing
C	maybe I will
A	rather than just let them run into
B	I haven't
C	what?
A	no
B	looking after their employees no not a lot of that going on at the moment
A	is that cos she works for them?
B	er she's working for the sixth form college until very recently
A	oh right
C	oh
B	er no no
A	lecturer?
B	no
C	so she'll be on a council thing my my pension's a
A	oh
C	I've got two I've I've got three actually
A	mm
C	but erm
A	well you never know I mean if you leave them sitting for a bit of time sometimes they do
B	they surprise you don't they?
A	years and years and years ago
C	mm
A	then it's been sitting there for thirty years or something
C	well I need to get
A	so it's actually appreciated it all on its own without my attention really
C	mm yes they they will do
A	mm?
C	and then the other one's the USS which is the universities pension
A	mind you didn't dad get shafted through that?
B	mm
A	when he retired they said to him that that they can deduct the
B	yes
A	how he miscalculated that god only knows
B	well probably not his fault was it?
C	mm
A	I don't know
B	well you don't really expect the man on the street to delve into these things and find out what's going on?
C	no they're truly complex these pensions
A	well I think you need to rely on your erm the employee representatives who are your trustees of your pension I think a lot of people went to sleep on the job a few years ago and didn't realise that I mean employers for example said oh let's have a pension
C	next
A	and they all said yeah that's fine
C	massively
A	contributions weren't what they should've been so they they carried on kind of contributing through the good times they would've been able to weather the bad times
C	mm
A	so I think there's probably quite a lot of charity er quite a lot of pension trustees that really ought to have been sued by the pensioners in their scheme for making really silly decisions in the eighties
C	well it was it was it was companies taking the piss it's the same as cutting back on your training budgets and those sorts of things that's what they always do
A	mm
C	oh stop we'll
B	then Iceland happens
C	yeah
A	well there is that isn't there?
B	mm
A	theoretically I'm entitled to start drawing down my pension
C	yeah one of my pensions should've started
A	really?
B	but when? what happened? why?
C	but I was
B	that could be our weekly bottle of wine
C	I don't think so
B	not even that much eh?
C	I doubt it
A	well people are complaining about how
A	self-interested
C	no I
A	so would you retire if you could?
C	blimey yes
A	would you?
C	oh within seconds
A	and what would you do
A	and will you be like mine who just think yes I'll just play Candy Crush and I'll do sudoku and I'll do the crosswords and then I'll listen to the football and then I'll listen to the cricket and then I'll listen to some music and then I'll read a book and then I'll go back to Candy Crush and then I'll
C	similar yeah
A	you think so?
C	I could learn Italian I'd ride my bicycle
A	mm mm?
C	go and live in France and improve my French
A	ah yes the going to live in France plan
C	we're going to look at
A	I know I've heard this
C	erm
A	are we gonna set up a network of French gîtes?
C	yeah
A	across France
C	mm
A	we'll each have a gîte
C	mm
A	send people from gîte to gîte
C	no
A	you're just retiring?
C	yeah
A	mm mm
C	I'm not going nowhere near any of that stuff
A	ah
B	no
C	you could do it
B	why would I want to?
C	I don't know you might
C	wanna run a gîte darling?
B	no I don't wanna run a gîte
C	that's alright then
A	oh
C	she's stopped now
A	that's alright she's been ringing me I'm offended with her I'm not speaking to her at the moment
A	she told me to
A	well I mean
A	I left
C	yeah
A	so this is a really kind of forward step isn't it really?
C	an interesting concept
A	or because actually erm I dunno
B	if you go back to
A	it's that kinda Bobby Ewing moment it's just like oh my god
B	yeah you're still in the eleventh floor of a tower block overlooking
A	I'm still in
A	eh
A	oh my god
A	it's all been a terrible dream it's not true
C	don't know
A	actually I probably couldn't afford to live in
B	you probably couldn't no
C	can you pass that glass?
A	if the truth be known
A	no I'm driving home I shouldn't drink any more should I?
C	are you?
A	well I've got to go home haven't I?
C	oh
A	I have to phone mum and dad
B	that's alright that's the easy part
C	that's alright it's easy
A	no no no no don't well I can sober up before I go
A	mm
C	you can you can go back
B	he's had the windows open all afternoon you're alright
C	sometime in the morning
B	there wasn't a smell
A	oh yeah
C	it was freezing yeah
A	but I might diffuse his essence
C	it's not his essence normally comes out of an aerosol so I shouldn't worry
A	well
C	much to his mother's distress at times
A	oh really?
C	they well they do lay it on a bit
A	they do actually don't they boys?
C	when when he uses it
B	it's like it drives the all the oxygen out of the room it's
A	I know some of these smells
A	have an asthma attack
C	yeah
B	they've all been told they've been told they've been told repeatedly
A	don't put so much
B	well no I don't quite tempted to throw the bloody aerosols out of the house and go in there steal it and throw it away cos it's just awful
A	I was telling people at my book group about mum doing that to a book of mine once
B	Marilyn French?
A	no it wasn't no no no it wasn't
B	was it that one?
A	no no no it wasn't Marilyn French it was Lenny Bruce How to Win Friends and Influence People
C	oh right
A	and I bought it from the bookshop and I
A	and I hadn't read it I'd it was on a Saturday and I'd been out and I'd bought it and it was in a paper bag and I put it in my room
C	mm
A	and I then went out and I came back and I thought where is that paper bag? couldn't find it anywhere
C	no no no
A	I haven't seen it no no no
A	waited till Monday went over the whole house still couldn't find it
A	ripped limb from limb
A	and mum had obviously gone in my
B	and with her unerring instinct
A	yes
B	finds exactly the right page
A	yeah he's married to somebody called Honey
A	who was a bit of a loose woman
A	and so she's
A	and read it so I didn't find out till much later what was wrong with this book because I hadn't even read it so I didn't even know what was in the middle of it but she'd obviously oh oh guess what
B	woo
A	oh oh and er had like
A	she said to me the other day oh you know why have you written? why have you written me this letter? because we've always been able to talk
B	I think you'd find the talking comes from one side and not from the other
C	I my my I would say my recollection was was me doing a lot of listening
A	that is true yeah
C	or probably hearing actually would be more accurate
A	yeah I don't know she's probably forgotten that book
A	has some vague memory of something
C	good heavens
A	I know but I was just I
C	mm
A	that's just been thrown torn up and thrown in the bin
C	mm
A	that I have to spend again
A	on the makeup counter to get that back
C	oh blimey
A	didn't
A	and all these shades of eye shadow and stuff like that
B	number seven
C	long gone Woolworths though
A	I know used to have really nice lunch there as well in the canteen egg and chips on Saturday
A	but I had to leave because I lied about my age when I joined
A	so when I got to the age where I was supposed to be able to work I had to leave
A	so they didn't find out I'd been working illegally
C	dear
A	all this previous period
C	Woolworths was quite a fun shop
A	it was
C	all those flat counters
B	well it's like I suppose it's like erm Robert Dyas these days isn't it? was
A	mm
B	a bit like Woolworths used to be
A	mm
B	apart from the sweets
A	mm
C	the Woolworths in
B	I don't think you're talking loudly enough
A	is it not setting off the whatnot?
B	you're not registering very much
C	well my voice doesn't work gone cold
A	well where the where's?
C	well yeah anyway it was very big the Woolworths in
A	in
C	mm with three entrances and when Manchester United came to play
C	all the Manchester United
C	ran from one street to the other through Woolworths
A	excellent
C	people leaping from
A	yeah
C	since I never went to any football matches I had no idea what football supporters got up to
B	was it WH Smith's in
A	it did
A	mm
B	the chemist on the corner and the tourist information office
A	mm
B	in between
A	that's true Debenhams did as well didn't it?
B	yeah well it wasn't Debenhams at the time though was it?
A	and
B	wasn't Debenhams at the time it was somebody else but it was
A	mm
B	can't remember the name of it
C	Woolworths was always one floor wasn't it? there was only one level
A	I think upstairs was the stockroom and the
C	yeah well
B	we used to get our Friday sweets didn't was it on Friday we used to get sweets or was it Thursday when we used to get sweets?
A	can't remember which day it was
B	cos it was comics on Thursday
A	mm
B	was it sweets on a Monday or was it sweets on a Friday?
A	I thought it was Friday or was it Monday?
B	it might've been Monday
B	did I? I don't remember that
A	other people got their sweets and just ate them
B	it must've it was comics sweets and pocket money
A	mm
A	I think the sweets were supposed to last you all week weren't they?
B	some of us made them last all week
A	mm yeah
B	apparently
A	very irritating
C	can imagine yeah
B	well it was definitely comics on a Thursday
A	we weren't allowed to have Jackie cos that was obscene
C	oh dear
A	had kissing in and things like that
C	well we used to have Look and Learn that's what we got
A	I can't remember what
B	did you learn from it though?
C	yeah yeah
B	that's the question
C	yeah yeah
C	then one day it had to stop cos my parents couldn't afford it anymore
A	oh no
A	oh my god
A	well we had two regimes we had the regime when dad used to pick us up
A	do you remember Mars bars coming in for the first time?
C	was
B	no
A	don't you?
C	Mars bars were seven pence
B	no no they were threepence
A	when we were in
C	Mars bars were expensive
A	when dad would come and pick us up we'd try and try and persuade dad to buy us a Mars bar on the way home
A	and then we went back to
B	can you remember sharing sharing?
B	sharing Creme Eggs on the bus home
C	if you share a Creme Egg oh no ugh
A	we used to do that at school we used to do that at school in the lower sixth
C	ugh
A	that corridor outside the kitchen
B	mm
A	the lower sixth kitchen
B	mm
A	standing in that window and there were about six of us sharing a chocolate Creme Egg just putting a little finger in and getting a bit of the goo out
B	oh
C	ugh
A	good thing norovirus wasn't around in those days or we'd
A	permanently ill
A	cos you weren't allowed out you were allowed out in break time when you were in the sixth form but not before
C	I don't think we were ever allowed out
B	to the corner shop
A	to the corner shop and buy chocolate and bring it back
C	yeah we had a tuck shop on the er
B	ah
C	at the school
A	we were
C	collared by the headmaster and sent to fetch his wine order from the er wine merchant in
A	ah
A	that's very grown-up
A	and I think we were fairly much infantilised at school anyway
C	oh dear there were cases of it though there was there was a big my Mini was packed er full of stuff
A	you were a schoolboy with a car?
C	my father erm insisted on me
A	pah
C	it was a very expensive
A	if only our father had insisted on having cars instead of having to ask him for lifts so that he could refuse
C	cost cost seven quid my Mini
A	that's no that's strange cos dad should've insisted we learnt to drive given that he objected so much to giving us lifts anywhere
B	no but he would've had to teach us wouldn't he?
A	that's true
C	I had driving instructors
C	yeah I had a driving instructor
B	mm
A	no I don't think we were in that we weren't in that league really were we? we were just in the bicycle league
B	well we just didn't have any money did we?
A	no
B	no money to go round
A	no
C	no it was a big thing for my father
A	I think we were impoverished because we had to go to France every year to see
B	she paid
A	so I know she sent the money over but I think it was still kind of kind of expensive so we never had any spare money for anything did we really?
A	everything was always very hand to mouth
B	well it was but that's cos there were so many of us
A	there were just so many of us
B	well wasn't
A	yes well I mean they're a bit
B	well no I don't think they
A	no
B	wasn't they did everything they could
A	yeah well no absolutely I feel
B	had four children very quickly
A	they had four children very quickly they don't get on their feet really they couldn't get on their feet before they started having children and then they never they were on the back foot always after that really
C	my father made quite a lot of money mending cars
A	ah
C	mm
A	taken you know she didn't think he charged enough she should've been
C	yeah I think she just liked moaning
C	yes but she's sectioned
C	bit different
A	actually I can't remember the last time I hit somebody
A	a very sharp tongue though
C	ah well it's probably worse
A	choose your poison really
C	mm
A	ah
A	well you know strategically
C	therefore they ought to be very careful
A	yeah very careful
A	apparently stood him in good stead
B	until that bloke until that man hit him with a chair
A	oh well yeah he looked me up on LinkedIn the other day
C	really?
A	for some reason yeah
C	mm
A	very spooky when I get stalked by him
B	doesn't he know everything that you used to know?
A	dunno
C	dunno
A	have you seen my photo on LinkedIn?
B	I think I have
A	it's very fetching
C	is it?
C	LinkedIn spent a period of time suggesting I connect with one of my ex-wives
A	you do have so you do you have to be quite firm with them sometimes
A	as to who it's like oh my god not that person
C	no
C	I don't
A	yeah don't you? oh oh right I don't know how they well they dredge through other people's inboxes though
C	yes they do yeah
A	if they've ever written
C	people you might know
A	dunno
C	don't be silly
A	the new way
B	so did your ex-wives have got your email address in their
C	it doesn't work
B	address book then?
C	it well it doesn't work
A	oh dear
A	well if you've got mutual acquaintances it happens
C	it will it'll be mutual acquaintances and places where you worked and stuff like that
A	they do go
C	yeah
B	you already have moved on from there thank you very much
A	mm
A	no I need to make much more
A	use of these things really
C	I've been headhunted a couple of times through LinkedIn
A	have you really?
C	mm
A	how did you do that?
C	well headhunters are lazy buggers so they just use LinkedIn
A	do they?
C	mm
A	well I do get looked at from time to time people'll think who the hell's that? why are they looking at me? but nobody's ever offered me a job
C	I've had
A	have you?
C	yeah yeah
A	oh my god I'm doing something terribly wrong
A	yeah no I know
C	mm
A	that I could've done standing on my head
C	mm
A	within eight miles of my home
A	the worst thing in the whole world is applying for European funds because
C	it is
A	the regimes for European funds are so appalling
C	mm
A	really vile and you have to get the proper match funding and if it's not match funding for the right sources you end up having to give the money back and you go bankrupt
C	no
A	and I've known people I know
A	one of my friends
A	so it's just such a absolute nightmare anybody like when
A	quite frankly you know do not do not ever mess with European funds er as far as I'm concerned
C	that's
A	so then the so then
C	reapply mm
A	and I said well I would want a job share cos I don't want the full-time job I want a part-time job so they said well you have to apply anyway and see if there's anybody else who wants a jobshare and then we'll see if they want a jobshare in the end
C	oh I hate I
A	ah
C	ah
A	went through all of this and then they rejected me because they said they said would you work part-
A	and I said no
C	no
A	no I
A	so then they rejected me
A	and you just compare with your
C	oh dear yeah
A	and the sector that I work in is just like so proper
A	you can't possibly can't possibly do this because
C	oh headhunters just
A	wouldn't be proper
C	just out to make money that's that's the problem
A	yeah well
C	the erm
A	the voluntary sector is so self-righteous about these things
C	we've got when is it? Thursday Thursday Thursday and Friday I think
A	mm
C	so we've got two of them
A	oh
C	this is the campus it's small it's crap
A	oh
C	we shall see it'll be be quite interesting to see what they er the the headhunters have not done a very good job and they're er just
A	oh dear oh
C	I remember other places er they they were advertising for erm for heads of business schools and stuff which is
A	you can they have to be
C	well you know
A	oh yeah but there's so much to offer
C	halfway houses
A	yeah
C	exhausted
B	mm
A	do you sleep when you're exhausted?
A	or do you still stay awake when you're exhausted?
B	well you go four or four or five days where you're just absolutely exhausted and then eventually you get eight hours sleep feel halfway better and then you go back to another five days of only getting five hours
A	have you been? have you talked to the doctor about it?
B	no
A	you should perhaps talk to the doctor about it I've got some sleeping pills
A	why's that not turned off?
B	what's our share?
A	bit of grouting actually
C	oh brilliant
C	there you go
B	bar of chocolate
A	ah that's true
C	ah
A	yeah a bar of chocolate yeah Oreo-flavoured chocolate
C	Oreo
A	yeah no I know it's chocolate bar with chocolate biscuits in it
B	oh yeah but I thought they were charcoal flavour
A	that's since Cadbury's got bought up by Kraft or whatever it is they now put all sorts of things in their chocolate
C	do they?
B	are these? are they
A	no they're not they're not chocolate
C	well they're sort of
A	no they are chocolate flavour they're
C	they're brown
B	carbon flavour
C	they're brown definitely brown and white
B	they might be yes but that doesn't explain anything does it?
C	or if they're black and white I'm not sure
A	no they're black they're like er bourbons with white
C	they're black
A	stuff in they they're round aren't they? they're round and they're white
C	yeah what's his? what's his name? er
A	oh
C	mm erm think
A	well so no right-thinking no right-thinking person should ever eat these biscuits again
A	mm
C	right-wing biscuits
