C	well exactly
B	never got
A	yeah we would've
B	we wouldn't have got

C	yeah
B	I bought it it I bought it er very early as well
C	mm
B	I wouldn't mind but your father broke into the children's museum
B	because you
A	oh
B	because you pay the cash desk was ahead of you and the shop was down there
A	yeah
B	but so was the museum so as as all these people were crowding around the desk he said right come and we whipped down there
A	sneaking into
A	the Moomin museum
B	yeah
A	why would there be a Moomin museum in Sweden? it's a Finnish product
B	yeah but Finland is was part of Sweden at one point
C	mm
A	that's like saying France some of France was part of England so we're gonna
A	claim like brie
B	I know I know I know I know but it's no they're very keen on Moomin up there
A	because Moomins rock
C	they are good

A	no
C	mm
A	so are you all packed? did your bikini new bikini top come?

C	mm too far
B	yeah
B	oh
A	would have had men dropping their jaws like anything
C	he wouldn't have been happy
C	no I've gone for a different one but it's
A	uhu
C	it's actually very nice it's a halter neck one
A	yeah I find halter necks much more supportive and flattering
C	mm
B	well when you've got big boobs like you've got
C	the same size as mine
A	no I think that's one size smaller than yours mm
B	I'm a
A	I'm pretty sure double H doesn't even exist
B	double J
C	off the scale
B	double K exists
A	double K
B	mm
A	what's that?
B	actually er
A	how can you be a thirty-four but I'm a thirty-two?
B	because er mine's all out front
A	no but you're wider than me here
B	mm I'm a thirty-four if I have a thirty-six everything drops
A	oh
B	mm
C	it's weird how it works though isn't it?
A	mm
B	that's why I always go to Bravissimo because they sort of don't bother measuring you they just sort of look at you and go oh
A	they do look at you and then they do sometimes
C	mm
A	mm
C	how clever
A	mm
B	they are they're very clever in there
A	they genuinely just look at boobs and know what size you are
C	yeah what a special gift
B	yeah they were
A	yeah they do they have them everywhere
B	where you lift and it says what do you think this girl is? she last bought thirty-six C and you lift it up thirty-two double H and you go oh and she went I never really thought about that
B	you everybody used to grow up being thirty-six C
C	mm
B	that's what we were all told we were when we went to Marks and Spencer's you buy a thirty-six C and it wasn't till I was pregnant and got with
A	it is it is one of those where you think like I would
C	yeah
A	oh and that girl's wearing the wrong bra oh and you'd notice them everywhere like you'd notice
C	you would
A	the poorly fit bras
C	mm
B	well we did didn't we? going round France
A	apparently some people didn't even don't even understand the concept of a bra it was like
C	oh okay
A	boobs everywhere flopping around
B	well
A	no they're not
B	they are they are
B	seriously and and you sat there and you thought what you've gotta do darling is wear a bra
C	mm
B	you know cos I always used to wear sports bras once I got really heavy and just sports bras
A	you can also apparently buy a special like cream to keep your skin like
B	oh bollocks to that
C	yeah
A	mine are still perky at the moment and I'm happy with that

B	well
B	at the moment
A	oh
C	was she?
A	because she's very tired but still she was very grumpy
C	mm
A	she was a grumpy bitch
B	I think the problem is when people go round
C	yeah
B	but when she felt she feels obliged to do a little bit of a tour with them and this that and the other and she doesn't need to do that
C	no
B	at all because all I mean
C	mm
B	I couldn't be bothered to go round with this lot and then yesterday erm I sat in the park for an hour waiting for

A	all free yes
B	yes they are
A	so I'm deciding on whether it's worth marrying somebody in the building trade and foregoing good conversation and intelligence
B	some it depends on some of them are quite intelligent
A	oh
B	some builders are quite intelligent
A	yeah
B	because they're they're actually on the design side and the you know
C	yeah
B	they're not that awful

A	a
B	a jihadi bride
B	bride couldn't she?

A	yeah but you also bought eight bottles of body wash
B	ten
A	ten
C	yeah
A	that definitely
A	has not happened I've nicked one body wash in my life and about nine rolls of toilet
B	yeah I was gonna say let's say the nine rolls cos I came back and there was a
A	er no I no
B	there was a whole packet
A	no that time I only nicked three but over probably the last like year I've definitely
A	nicked about nine or ten
B	yeah I know
A	the odd one or two every time I go home because toilet roll's really expensive
C	it is really expensive
B	and the good stuff yeah
C	yes I
A	but if you go

B	quartered
A	what if I have massive diarrhoea?
B	you only still need the three cos then you buy the Andrex buy one get one free Andrex wipes
C	yeah get some wipes that'll sort you out
B	no but as I say if you buy I always found that like if you buy good toilet roll you don't use as much and it's really
C	it is true
B	and it's really soft
C	it's true
B	and nice and
A	and you don't get like bum rash
