A	yes
C	yeah her
A	well
B	are you a thespian?
[ANNOTATION]	A theatrical performance will take place.	Neutral
A	I often claim it to be my alternative career if I ever pursued it
B	really?
B	where did you say it was
C	it's um it's
B	but what area is that in?
C	so that's um
B	oh okay
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker C wouldn't help speaker A in the theatrical pursuits.	Contradiction
B	where's that?
A	em Creation in
B	oh the same one you went to the other day?
A	mm
B	sounds like fun
A	yeah
B	you don't have a safety?
A	you do but as you go up you clip your rope on
[ANNOTATION]	Creation is not a safe place.	Contradiction
B	okay
A	and then every so often you clip on again it's like every two metres or every metre and a half two metres
B	are there safety mats?
A	em well no not the big climbing walls because you're tied on
B	oh
A	you'd swing and drop
B	mm mm
[ANNOTATION]	Clips but no safety mats exist in that place.	Entailment
A	no he's in London
B	is he?
C	is he?
A	yeah
B	what's he doing there?
A	eh meeting some of
B	is
A	well yeah if he's calling her his girlfriend yeah I don't think he is
C	boyfriend?
A	if he's calling her his boyfriend yeah
A	so she used that on me like for the rest of the night
B	more than flatmates
A	well we're kind of like into the similar things
B	mm
A	chasing women
B	all at the same time
A	yeah that would proper be properly ambidextrous
B	what kind of engineering does he do?
A	manufacturing
B	ah okay
A	they use a lot of Japanese theory like lean manufacturing so you don't have you don't keep a lot of stock and it's all like moving the products efficiently and like removing bottle necks through a process and making sure that you cut down on operational costs and include like the thoughts of people
B	okay
A	and just improve the working environment
B	but I mean okay I'm a total non-expert but to me that doesn't sound like anything to do with engineering
A	you have a quality engineer
B	building?
A	I mean the definition of engineering is like applying physics to its applied physics to the real world
B	ah
A	so you make things happen
B	I thought it was all about engines innit?
A	engineering itself is not all about engines
B	so there's a lot of different fields of engineering?
A	well I'm in energy he's in manufacturing transport pharmaceutical biomechanical engineering
B	oh right
A	it's a broad remit there's like loads of different institutions you've got the IMechE the IChemE
B	is civil engineering like building structures
A	building and structures yeah so underground works and above ground works
B	and what did you specialise in?
A	I did mechanical engineering
B	so what's mechanical engineering? It that about engines
A	em it's about it's not about electricity cos that's electrical engineering
B	mm
A	and the things that carry the water and what not
B	mm
A	very intriguing
B	and do you use did you do a Masters in that?
A	yeah
B	and do you use what you learnt in your job?
A	em I use like some of the business bits
B	mm
A	it's very rare that you do a course and you use like a hundred percent of it in your career
B	yeah true
C	where? At university?
B	yeah
B	where did you do that?
B	mm
A	did you? I don't know that
C	it was
B	there's a cat in the garden
A	it's a fat cat isn't it? Oh no it's a big cat
B	no
C	the Five Live was saying one day this lady last week
A	didn't you hear about the record we talked about this
B	mm
A	the biggest ever fox caught in Scotland
C	oh God
B	but there's one that runs around my parents road at night and I've seen it quite often and it's cos I look at when I see it I see it from above it's a sturdy thing
C	that's how those um foxes mauled that um
A	baby
C	yeah
B	where was that?
A	it was last year sometime they had left the patio window open and this fox just just went in and I don't know what happened it
C	it mauled the baby
A	either it was cornered or what but yeah it ended up yeah pawing this baby and
C	yeah and the toddler as well
B	both of them?
C	yeah
B	did it kill them?
A	no
C	but the baby in particular was quite injured
B	oh dear
C	I don't like this
A	what about you mean bad stories?
B	so are you now going to reveal that it was in fact you disguised as a fox?
C	about like eh gym memberships and things
A	slagging them off?
C	no about the utilising them
A	what? That you're not utilizing them?
C	over utilizing past the expiry date
A	ooh
A	what? So you haven't paid your membership fee but you're still able to use it?
C	so I'll repeat it
C	so when I went to um the yoga class
A	mm
C	so I paid for about
A	well your conscience
C	well the way I looked at it it was that you know
C	actually as long as I'm exercising
B	just not paying yeah
C	as long as I'm being you know healthy
B	you're probably sweating more cos you're worried about getting caught
C	yeah
A	so you're a lady of leisure this afternoon?
B	yes
A	you've got Sunday lunch
B	yeah but I have to do stuff around it
C	do you get the number thirty-seven to Solihull then?
B	yeah I catch the one get on the one just outside here and change at the roundabout at
C	have you had another lesson?
B	no I've got one on Monday and one on Tuesday
C	you're going for it aren't you?
B	Vrmmm
A	well it's a good use of time once you've got it
B	exactly
C	have you passed your theory test?
B	no
C	get with the driving first to
B	yeah
C	to get a feel for it
B	definitely
A	as long as you're studious it's really not that hard to pass the theory test
B	no
C	I've got the DVD and all of that kind stuff so
B	oh have you?
A	but the most up to date like version of the theory test?
C	yeah and on your smartphone you can get um eh an app
B	mm hm
C	to keep and it's really good and you just keep testing yourself
B	that's good
C	like when you've got like a spare ten minutes on the bus or something just do a twenty-five questions you know
B	mm hm
C	just knock them off multiple choice questions and it keeps it fresh
B	that's a good idea
A	mm
B	and I was like arghhhh I don't want to
C	you don't have to really
B	I've already got Hotmail and Yahoo mail
A	who said you have to set up a Google mail account?
B	the guy at Carphone Warehouse
B	em that's what I didn't really understand
A	oh yeah cos Android is the Google platform for the Samsung phone
B	really?
A	and
B	Samsung
A	similar to
B	I don't know
A	he's got the Galaxy
B	okay
C	yeah
B	in in in light of the privacy scandals
A	it was always open on your phone
C	yeah
B	yeah I can't
C	you can't put it off
B	there's no way of signing out
C	I've got to I've got it open on mine
A	I can sign out on my phone on my Gmail account
B	really?
A	yeah
B	there was no option all the the only options were to go see the inbox and to add another account another email account to it
A	mm
B	so in the end I went on the internet and deleted my account which wasn't obvious how to do
C	I'm just looking
B	I don't know if you can
A	actually I can't see a sign out option on my phone
B	exactly
A	yeah
C	do you know how?
B	and hidden at that
C	do you know how to set up you know to receive picture messages?
A	can you not receive picture messages?
C	I have to go and log on to O two
B	is that MMS?
C	yeah
B	have you not got just an option like when you like to attach something to your
C	yeah
B	can you check your internet on the other phone?
C	yeah
B	the two numbers that you've got?
C	yeah
A	but then you just
C	keep a private phone then I'll have to kind of keep that going
A	I don't like the idea of using my work phone for all my own business as well
B	is that a work phone then? mm
C	I did separate it but if
B	true
C	need to get a better case for this
A	em so does it say you need to log onto O two? There should be kind of like if there's a link to log onto you just do that and then it'll have some options and tick preferences or whatever or your phone for the
B	but isn't that something quite basic? I don't understand why such basic things
C	yeah
A	I mean I've got picture messages on my
B	mm
A	account
B	how weird
A	they usually do like four to one for picture messages
B	really but
A	you you just have to check
B	Cos I'm sure it's too good to be true this whole deal
A	just an hour?
B	yeah
A	the irony of that
A	is she going?
C	get some classes too
B	did you go last night?
C	no the candlelit class was full
B	oh
A	the way described how you looked when you came back was pallid and fluffy
A	you look like just everything had been sweated out of you and you were just like
B	mm
C	and if you haven't repaired
A	yeah
C	exactly
B	yeah
A	I didn't exercise yesterday
B	did you go to that new restaurant last night?
C	well so we were going to go to the candlelit class and then em they had by like midday they had filled the thirty seats so you could book online so then we were gonna we kept trying to ring them and saying look is it worth us coming first come first serve? And and they said well we've got fifty out of fifty-five people here already
B	Good
C	we didn't we just had snacks actually like hummus and pitta and stuff
B	it's just really like a kind of sterile environment
C	it's it's it's warmed up a little bit now
B	really?
C	yeah
B	was that the one she met on the Guardian website?
C	yeah
B	oh
C	and um and we were like oh I don't know
C	yeah
B	on the Guardian dating website
C	oh really? Ah
A	I've logged onto these things before and said I'm a woman seeking a man or a man seeking a man just to see who I know on there
C	it's really unnerving when I um looked at it and I can't remember what year but when I hadn't actually I
A	pretty small world
C	yeah
B	it's like that the waiter at the kitchen garden cafe the one who always jokes about him looking like a bar of Bourneville chocolate
C	oh yeah yeah yeah
unknown_female	yeah
B	and he's quite dark black isn't he?
C	yeah yeah
B	milk chocolate coloured
A	so what
B	mm chocolate
A	what?
B	cookie bar last night
A	galaxy is just fake chocolate
C	melts in your mouth though
B	went down quite well in my book
A	it's not real chocolate
C	you know the chocolate I love is the stuff that um
C	God they're so
A	Don't you have some in the box I left here do you remember before Christmas and like a silver box here just full of chocolates
C	oh god they're so gorgeous  they're so gorgeous  they've got a little bit
B	ooh
A	what?
B	they're so good
C	chilli chocolate um cocktails are nice
B	mm
A	for the past two weeks I've been to the um nothing to do with chocolate
B	mm
A	I've been to The Prince of Wales cocktail bar
B	oh yeah
A	oh my god their cocktails are so good
B	where's that? Is it?
C	the Prince of Wales if you go as if you're going towards the back
B	uh-huh
C	it's in the side room
B	oh
A	they've got like a really nice fire keeping it warm it's like a little proper little salon
B	nice
A	and they've got this one guy who they've got in there now and he just takes like five minutes to over every drink
B	mm hm
A	he properly did it so like you basically you have coke at the bottom and then you have like a spirit sat on top
B	oh does he put like a spoon on and pour the the alcohol onto the spoon?
A	yeah and then the week before I had a margarita and I had a proper like salt rim
B	how much are they?
A	six quid each
B	that's not too bad
A	it's like the equivalent of having two normal drinks
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	in bars
C	and here it's like four
B	it's four
C	four fifty in some places yeah
A	is it?
B	ooh and not even that good wine
C	yeah it's just
A	yeah I paid three pound forty for a bottle of beer last night which is these days any drink less than three pounds is rare beer wise
C	well that Skyline bar is a little bit pricey like um I suppose it's relative isn't it? Em we had we drank rosé last night and it was twenty pounds a bottle
B	is that in a restaurant?
C	in the bar bit of Indigo
B	oh okay
A	twenty quid a bottle?
C	yeah
B	yeah
B	is Indigo that bar at the top of the Cube?
C	yeah
B	yes
C	it's quite exclusive
B	it probably puts hike up the prices
C	yeah
B	it's beautiful
C	yeah
C	how come?
A	this girl I went on a girl I went with on a date is from Hong Kong
A	what are you doing?
B	money money rich rich
A	saying that
B	what's one of them?
A	apparently it's a female dominated country
A	oh
A	in my eh book at the moment um you have these like random chapters at the start of each thing saying in Northern Africa there used to be a gynocracy and the women were known as the Amazonians
B	oh are you reading Stieg Larsson?
A	yeah
B	I've read all those books
A	I think it's really interesting they say like the women warriors could only take a man if they'd killed a man in battle
B	you're like sign me up
A	well it's all be like Syria and Algeria and stuff now
B	yeah like
C	what was I reading about that?
B	yeah that that author was he's um was really really into
A	he was a specialist in
B	yeah I think it stems from when he was about fifteen he his the group of friends that he was with raped a girl and he didn't do anything to stop it cos he was so shocked
A	shit
B	and that gave him such feelings of guilt
A	he died like a year after the books
B	yeah
A	were finished didn't he?
B	yeah
A	then he had a heart attack?
B	yeah
A	he wasn't even that old was he?
B	no I don't think so
A	yeah he was a right wing expert as well
B	they thought that maybe he'd been taken down
A	like Anders Behring Breivik and his crew of his crew
B	mm hm
A	he was Norwegian
B	norwegian inspired clothing and they're apparently these clothes are very favoured by far right groups in the Nordic countries and so they opened their new shop and called it after him and apparently there's
A	what?
B	been this huge outcry in Germany
A	yeah he's like slaughtered
B	but so many people think he's a martyr
A	fucking hell
B	and see him as a role model
C	I met Anneka Rice on Thursday
B	ooh
A	did you have a jumpsuit on?
B	did you have a little radio pack? Did you talk to her like this? Hi Anneka stop the clock stop the clock
A	go go go
B	what was that show she used to present?
A	challenge Anneka
C	challenge Anneka
A	Friday nights
C	yeah and before that Treasure Hunt on Channel Four
A	treasure hunt?
C	which was a prototype for it
B	oh I remember that one
C	yeah
B	there was another good one there
A	no
B	I don't think it was presented by Anneka Rice but it was of a similar genre to the Treasure Hunt one
C	yeah
B	that was brilliant
C	well so she was talking about her life actually and she's quite interesting like she sort of said that you know she started off an apprenticeship at the age of seventeen and you know the fact that her mum absolutely resented having kids and you know and she was like basically a mother of the second world war who was quite intelligent and thought you know actually I've had these kids but I don't want them and went to study and got degrees and all of that and actually you know resented Annika and so they grew up basically you know no baking no nothing never you know and
B	mm
C	so she grew up quite fast and then she talked about sort of like going her friends going to university and her not and she got an apprenticeship at the BBC when she was seventeen and pretended she was twenty-five because so she could be taken seriously and
B	mm
C	and then sort of fell out of love with like British TV and thought it was all really insipid and this all sort of reality culture and how people started calling her and harassing her family and
B	really?
C	you know
B	oh okay that aspect of it
C	you know and I absolutely I felt hounded and she said I won't even talk about the Levenson Inquiry because actually I've got an awful lot you know if I start to raising my claim you know and
B	and she actually left
C	and she just felt so disillusioned
B	mm
C	so in Austria it's like Challenge Fritz eh you know in New York it's Challenge Erin Brokovich
B	mm and what's her reason in to coming back into the business after having such strong feelings about
C	exactly
B	oh okay
C	sort of people they don't really care about
B	yeah
C	you know old ageing
B	mm hm
C	she was sort of like typecasting that as well
B	what is she gonna be doing?
C	she's presenting on Radio Two a breakfast show on Saturday and Sunday mornings and then she's doing something for TV but I'm not sure what
B	mm
C	but once she's in she's gonna be right back in the fold
B	right
C	exactly
B	not just some plastic celebrities who are famous for being famous
C	exactly
B	I don't know half you know even reading on The Guardian newspaper like eh you see the headlines Stacey Solomon stripped of her mum of the year title
C	exactly
A	she was on X Factor wasn't she?
C	who the fuck?
B	who is she?
A	she was on X Factor
C	she was a stupid girl on X Factor who
C	yeah
A	she was quite fit though
B	did she win?
C	no she was not
A	she's quite
C	no
B	yes
A	I thought she was fit
C	she's so
B	I don't think you're very discerning are you with the whole
A	what?
B	oh it's a woman quick chase after her
A	oh my god
C	she was yeah and so she became famous because of the way she spoke exactly like how
B	so she didn't win?
[ANNOTATION]	they are not sure she win or not	Neutral
C	she didn't win
A	mum of the year
B	why did she get her title of the mum of the year stripped?
C	God knows
A	Cos she used to walk fifty miles back and forth each day to fetch water
B	no but she
A	it's like bum of the year? How do you become rear of the year?
C	exactly
A	who who organises that?
[ANNOTATION]	they know who organizes that	Contradiction
C	FHM
A	no rear of the year isn't FHM
A	I need to go in a minute
C	your friend's not here
A	no I'll just pop to the shop on the way and get a couple of beers
B	I might try and reorganise um my meeting tomorrow morning cos I didn't go to ashtanga last night cos I was helping
C	go
A	I'd love to try it
[ANNOTATION]	he never try it	Contradiction
B	mm
C	yeah
B	mm
A	yeah I'm going out for a bit of food but I'll be back probably at eight
B	okay well I'll let you know and if if I am around should we just meet meet in kitchen at ten fifteen?
A	exactly
B	cool
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about party	Entailment
A	no I am
B	are you receiving texts on your phone?
A	yeah
C	how come you've got two numbers?
B	because I've got my nineteen seventies mobile phone brick that I borrowed from my dad when I moved back to England
[ANNOTATION]	he borrowed car from her dad	Contradiction
A	in the?
B	as you go number and then when I got my smartypants phone
A	yeah the the texts that you sent before they came through quite late and there was two of them
B	yeah because you know when you phone when you texted
A	mm
B	and then I got so worried I'd burned the house down or something I ended up phoning you
A	but you sent two messages
[ANNOTATION]	how many messages send you	Neutral
B	of the same ones?
A	yeah
B	oh
C	which I shall I then keep? This number or the other one?
B	the yeah that that phone number
C	mm
B	my eye my smartphone was saying battery low battery low going to run out and it actually lasted another six hours but that's why I said call me on the other phone
C	should I get rid of this number then or keep it as a backup?
B	em whatever you want
C	but do you use it?
B	I'm kind of carrying it around at the moment because I've just been really badly organised about letting people know my new phone number
C	yeah
A	yes
C	I do love mine
A	yeah Kindle's the it's like an LCD screen
B	yeah
C	Reading as in I'm trying to do an experiment with the concept of Kindles so I'm reading a novel
B	mm
A	on a mobile device
B	my dad's got one if you want to have a squiz at it
C	if I like this if I I'm gonna finish the book if I like it then I'll I've seen the Kindle and my sister's got one
B	right
C	but I just wanted to know if I preferred the um book or the scrolling
B	em mm
C	thing
A	right I'm going to
B	no it's it's ever so good the screen it doesn't look like a screen does it?
C	it's the concept though isn't it? Of using a scroll rather than
B	bye have a good climb
A	see you later on
C	see you
B	bye
C	yeah
B	they're quite I think they're they're very portable that would be a a plus for them
C	yeah exactly
B	then again I always have to take so many books to the charity shop because I just don't have enough shelf space for all the books that I've read
C	I love it
B	mm
C	I think books are so comforting and beautiful
B	you've got quite a lot of shelving in that room haven't you as well
C	it's a bit like it it looks a bit like
B	no she had a walk in wardrobe
C	yeah she did
C	so I've got to come up with ideas
B	mm
C	I don't need to be in solitary confinement to do it
B	well I like the idea of getting some take away and getting
C	okay
B	and just having a chill day
C	shall we see what they're up to?
B	let's
C	yeah
B	then again they've probably only just ate eaten breakfast haven't they?
C	yeah
B	and after
C	yeah
B	have you seen her this week?
C	so I bumped into her yesterday she sort of came down to say hi as she was leaving and spoke to for like literally two minutes
B	cool
C	I just text
B	yeah no that's a much better idea
C	exactly
C	yeah
B	do you have to write them or just think of the ideas?
C	well basically I need to get them done by the end of the month
B	mm hm
C	but I think I need to start sort of cos eh I I just haven't had a chance you know normally like I have a bit longer and I sort of start thinking and mull over it a little bit
B	mm hm
C	and you know really sort of and then when I'm like on the train or something then I'll just sit there and I start like bashing it out like
B	mm hm
C	or before bed
B	mm hm
C	but now I need to do it so I just need to start thinking about it a little bit and if I can come up with some blocks then at least it will give me something to start working on
B	yeah
C	and tomorrow I'm going to Warwick um for one o'clock um
B	ooh what for?
C	do you remember a presenter Gagan Grewal?
B	nope
C	em me and my friend

C	hi
B	em
C	and then it got to the point where like when they started going through a little bit of difficulty he was very silent you know he's very dignified he didn't you know he just when they started going through real problems he just sort of said look you know we're going through real difficulties at the moment and that was just more of a way of understanding etcetera
B	like I'm fourteen years old
C	yeah and it's all of this sort of stuff and I
B	mm
C	I don't think you should like just hang your coat up straight away
B	right
C	and yet the other day she rang him like during the week and said oh hi
B	did they have children?
C	no they
B	so they don't even have anything linking them together any more
C	no
B	so did she move out?
C	so what happened
B	mm
C	and you know  and you know  you're spending too much you know you don't earn enough and all of this kind of thing and he said well why don't you go and get a bloody job as well then we can get a bit more money? If you've feel so inadequate
B	and she's upstairs?
C	and
B	and she's involved her mum
C	you really really upset her you know you should be a bit you know you shouldn't shout when you lose your temper
B	argh
C	and all of this you know she's very sensitive and
B	this girl sounds like a nutcase
C	all this kind of stuff
B	is that to live with her parents?
C	so she went on
B	mm
C	so
B	mm hm
C	kind of thing
B	oh it sounds like
C	you know
B	he's best off without her
C	couldn't deal with tension
B	did he not realise before the marriage that she was a nutcase?
C	you know what? I think she just really liked the idea of being married
B	mm
C	and they have this like fairytale Hollywood like marriage
B	oh my days
C	it it was the you know it was the works
B	right so they were she was pumped by the idea of the wedding not the marriage?
C	absolutely and they you know they had all these like you know folk dancers in between he came in on a horse you know it was like the full-on shebang
B	when did they meet? How long did they had they know each other before that?
C	so they were sort of introduced like I think her her dad he he worked for like the Communist party and his there was some sort of like like
B	mm hm
[ANNOTATION]	That he knows someone who is a communist.	Entailment
C	and I think through a political connection you know blah blah blah you know of a way of oh you know I've got a son and I've got a daughter of you know so they just sort of met and they sort of went I think they went out for six months and in that time I remember at Christmas time like basically she what's an ectopic pregnancy?
B	oh when the foetus starts developing outside of the womb maybe? In the ovaries?
C	I don't know what it was then
B	oh god
C	because she didn't realise that she was even pregnant
B	right
C	and they just sort of decided in the new year we're getting as an addition
B	mm hm
C	the following summer
B	couldn't they just have a big party
C	yeah
B	God
[ANNOTATION]	That there was a big party.	Contradiction
C	they went to I think they did like a Caribbean holiday they did another
B	nice
C	stacking and packing it in the middle of the wedding planning and then they got married in the September and then one and a half years later they're going through a divorce
B	sounds like he needs a lot of friendly attention then
[ANNOTATION]	That they thought about taking a cruise to Europe.	Neutral
C	yeah
B	of normal people
C	of normality yeah
B	oh guy sounds like he's better off without her though
C	yeah
B	what a crazy woman
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	yeah he's a bit jaded like when we went to that party last weekend he was just like I'm going for an hour saying hello to Sonia
B	oh is that the
B	oh I thought ah it was leaving party? Oh cos she was leaving to go and get married
[ANNOTATION]	That she was planning a divorce.	Contradiction
C	yeah
B	has she left already?
C	em I think she's
B	oh
C	that's because they're all starting to have bloody kids
[ANNOTATION]	That a lot of couples have kids.'	Entailment
C	we've gone past the wedding season
C	they're done with that
B	I wonder how long it will take
C	I I think basically I think like this job is quite pivotal because if she gets it
B	yeah
C	and it's a London move
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	That there's a lot of available jobs.	Neutral
C	it's so pivotal because he can relocate like that
B	mm
C	em and actually it would be better for him to be in London
B	yeah but she was saying that if even if she gets the job they'll still try and buy a house around here?
C	yeah as an investment
B	oh right
C	because they can always live at
B	mm
C	they can buy this as an investment because it's good for them and also you know if they ever came back because
B	yeah
C	this is a good base isn't it? So
B	definitely
C	but I think you know in terms of like a longer-term sort of you know a a nest egg that's what they'd they might do and then they might move to London and stay at
B	it's difficult to know what house prices are gonna do though isn't it? I don't know whether actually is it an investment any more buying a house?
C	or is it a liability?
B	yeah
C	exactly
B	mm
C	and you've got deep unemployment you can't rent it out
B	yeah
C	can you carry on with those mortgage payments cos otherwise you're ruined
B	well that's the thing I think if you've got a mortgage a few years ago you know you you
C	two thousand and eight
B	you it ends up being cheaper than rent cheaper than monthly rent
C	but that's if you've got um a lot of you know a good down payment a good deposit then it's you know and and many you know whose
C	you need  You need  to give twenty percent at least
C	at least and then it also varies you know and that's the absolute minimum you need to put down at least twenty percent of the price of the property and that is without any you know legal fees you know consultancy fees
B	but if the average
C	any work you've done it any furniture anything
B	if the average salary is twenty-five thousand
C	yeah
B	which let's face it is barely a
C	yeah
B	how on earth are people supposed to A be able to invest in property
C	so the people that can do it
B	and have somewhere
C	are people where parents give you like fat sum of like fifty grand
B	but then then they're saying save for your retirement
C	it's the disparity  it's the disparity  and that's why it just seems it was talking to
B	well I think there's some logic to it because when you retire you can sell your house
C	exactly
B	downsize and you've made
C	yeah
B	a bit of income from it
C	yeah
B	I mean cos if you  if you  don't I mean you've got nowhere to live
C	in rent
B	in rent or buying a house
C	mm
B	and all your pension is spent
C	I wish I knew how smart people did it like there was a guy that um used to work at the BBC
B	uh-huh
C	that main road and you know just off the High Street
B	mm
C	and he bought it at the right time and he got it for ninety-eight grand
B	wow
C	and then he sold it for two hundred and ten grand
B	oh my life how many years later?
C	four years later
B	no
C	so he caught it at the right bloody time
B	Jammy dodge dodger
C	and then his partner Andrew also did the very similar thing
B	uh-huh
C	I think it was on second avenue that he bought a house and he got a good extra hundred grand off the back of that
B	yeah no see if I  if I  had um if I had been given a permanent contract in Spain I would have been able to buy at the time when it would have been extremely lucrative
C	yeah
B	because like fourteen years ago it would have cost thirty thousand? To get thirty thousand pounds to get a three bedroomed flat
C	no way
B	which now even with the the property crisis over there actually would it would probably be quite difficult to sell but for example had I bought it fourteen years ago and then sold it six years ago it would have
C	you'd have been about a hundred and eighty now
B	oh at least
C	yeah
B	to have shelter
C	yeah
B	to be able to earn a living wage that you with which you can pay
C	yeah
B	fuel and food and it just seems that nowadays there's no  there's no  guarantee of being able to have that
C	yeah absolutely
B	oh good job
