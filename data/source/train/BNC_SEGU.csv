B	kidney stones
A	that's the truth
B	after the Christmas party yeah
A	A private shindig
B	yeah
A	yeah no he's actually nuts
B	yeah
A	he's actually crazy so
B	okay
A	we're driving to
B	is that cos you're hung-over or you just haven't had a chance to get any word in?
A	yeah well or if I put words in
B	mm
A	so he's saying to me that she
B	twenty weeks? When did he split up with
A	no sorry I'm on about
B	oh
B	I thought this was the one in
A	no right
B	him and
A	what a strange way to quantify it
B	who says that?
A	I know
B	wouldn't you just say four months or five months or whatever it was?
A	yeah no
B	twenty weeks
A	which I thought was weird in the first place
B	like checking off on the calendar with red crosses
A	exactly
B	mm okay
A	em so I was like hmm that's a bit weird
B	so she wants her independence
A	anyway so she wants her independence back em and they were just you know seeing each other and having fun and you know it did seem to start to open up as if it was going to go somewhere and
B	mm
A	then she's run a mile and he said really I I just I thought to myself
B	mm
A	and so really it was kind of mutual
B	mm
A	he's then tried to convince himself that he can have some say in this
B	okay
A	which was really weird
B	mm
A	is as if she's this amazing fantastic person
B	mm
A	but they're just drifting apart and I said oh oh right em you know
B	mm
A	try and ask it about you know found out a bit about her try and put myself in his position a bit
B	mm
A	em you know well she just you know she wants to you know she wants to travel and you know and she's done the hairdresser thing and now she's doing the Premier Inn thing and
B	the what?
A	premier Inn
B	oh I thought we were premiering you know like
A	and that's the big dream
B	that's the living living living the dream
A	as the hairdressing was the big dream
B	okay
A	and so I wasn't quite following and then I
B	so she was a hairdresser for?
A	maybe this is me being a snob right I don't know
B	yeah
A	but she's like yeah now she's doing the Premier Inn thing and you know and I think maybe a year from now you know she probably you know
B	aw he's such a local boy
A	I know and I said
B	aw bless him
A	oh
B	mm
A	well yes yeah oh oh I see
B	mm
A	I said oh where is she moving to? Oh she's moving to
B	that's it she's going up in the world
A	she's moving to
B	oh bless
A	in with her auntie
B	oh kids
A	three strikes
B	oh bless him he is special isn't he let's be honest
A	it gets better
B	go on then
A	and then he said you know and she says to me
B	yeah
A	it's the way
B	yeah but
A	he didn't go travelling
B	yeah
A	but I'm just thinking what the fuck are these people for real?
B	yeah no
A	I I just really can't get on board with people that are like that
B	bless them they live in a very small world
A	really small
B	though don't they?
A	really small
B	mm
A	yeah comforting yeah
B	but then you leave
A	that's it
B	and you go and do your other life
A	your real life
B	you go and you know you're ambitious and do a job and you look at where you're going not not for them
A	yeah
B	you know they're just going to go to the pub everyday and see the same people every day
A	yes exactamundo
B	their aspirations are moving from a two bedroomed house in
A	that's it
B	mm
A	I've never like
B	quite a village mentality isn't it?
A	yeah and it just really shocked me
B	oh bless him
A	yeah
B	if it but it you know if he was
A	he said well you know I just don't want to lose a friend over it
B	mm
A	and I was like well to be honest I think I'm coming to the realization that perhaps you can't be friends with an ex
B	not immediately
A	you know
B	mm
A	and he said you know well just
B	mm
A	no
B	mm
A	I was like oh okay em
B	so where did she come from?
A	they've known each other for years
B	as you do
A	yeah really kind of weird
B	where everyone knows each other
A	yes
B	and everyone's cheating on each other
A	yes
B	yeah
A	and Alex got to know about her better he spent a lot of time with her and basically for three years they kind of pushed boundaries quite a lot
A	yeah
B	well yeah
A	yeah
B	the two quite damaged mental people think do you know what would be a brilliant idea? Let's get into a relationship together and be mental together
A	together
B	at least they're not afflicting it on anybody else
A	I know
unknown_female	hi
A	hi
B	hi Anna
unknown_female	are you going to have dinner now or?
A	no no
B	are we in your way? No come in
unknown_female	oh thanks
A	we can retire to the boudoir
B	yes
A	well
B	and when really what they actually have to do is think I I just need to be single for a little while
B	I know I know I just
A	but surely
B	it's actual nuttiness
A	it's the same thing with that
B	yeah
A	in actual fact being in a relationship does you more damage
B	well you've done well though considering when I poked my head in this morning
A	urgh
B	it's nice and warm though
A	nice
B	what is that?
A	what is this on my head?
B	where did this grow from? Oh
A	she took the regulator of the shower?
B	yeah and the the
A	I think it's because she knows that with
B	yeah
A	she doesn't have to be very committal she doesn't have to say much
B	mm
B	basically yeah it's because I'm
A	yeah
B	is this you joining the navy now?
A	yeah this is it
B	all in the bag
A	eh this was my swimming stuff actually
B	yeah
A	which I always do this and then in the morning in the morning I think why the fuck did you do that
B	oh could you just why don't you just make a pile
A	em I really want to wear these
B	was? Ah
A	it's just not the weather yet
B	not yet
A	yes
B	I think they're probably appropriate
A	yes I can definitely do that
B	yeah darling
A	yeah I told
B	oh right
A	she just be on to the profile pictures
B	mm
A	she's like so what you need to do is take photographs put them on Facebook put them in profile pictures you and
A	so I'm gonna do it
B	ah
A	she basically
B	who does? Eve?
A	yeah
B	I think that blokes are like that though
B	this is not appropriate dinner wear is it?
A	the sex top
B	I don't it doesn't really go but I'm going to take it just in case
A	no you can't
B	yeah
A	so that's a bit that's a bit dangerous
B	I'll take the sex top and maybe I'll put the sex top on
A	mm
B	and wander round the room in it a little while and then say do you know what? I can't I really can't wear this to dinner I'm going to put my other top on
A	yeah
B	just so then he can see the sex top but I just won't wear the sex top out
A	yeah
B	that's fine
A	I like it as a plan
B	it's a definite plan
A	so wear the wear the leather
B	really? How exciting
A	yeah but I'm keeping them
B	well obviously yeah
A	yeah
B	winner
A	I mean I think it's just the trousers I think obviously I don't know
B	can you wash them though?
A	maybe as I've worn them
B	boil wash?
A	you can't wash them
B	oh
A	wipe clean only
B	mm
A	doing a little but deeper cos they're not very deep at all
B	no it's quite an easy job there's a woman at the market who does em tailoring
A	yeah she could perhaps just take them they're not they're really not very much too much big it's literally just the waist band
B	mm
A	they're fine everywhere
B	mm
A	but the waistband they they slip down
B	mm
A	as I walk and I think I think because my legs just aren't fat enough to keep them tight to here so
B	mm
A	they slide down my thighs then my thighs then pull it down from the waist so
B	yeah
A	yeah I don't know I don't know what the best thing to do would be whether perhaps it might be better for her to take them in on the leg rather than the waist
B	well that's not gonna happen cos you're gonna just gonna get smaller
A	yeah maybe
B	I mean it's difficult isn't it? Cos you kinda want her to do it not so you can wear them now
A	mm
B	I mean can you put up with it for now?
A	I think so
B	I would wait
A	they didn't annoy me too much last night
B	mm
A	Cos against skin it tends to to go less
B	yeah it sticks a bit doesn't it?
A	yeah
B	mm
A	like they're not they're not large
B	mm
A	they're they're not a small pair of trousers it's not like they're ridiculously too small they're just very straight
B	mm
A	they should really go in at the waist to kind of hug on a bit
B	yeah pick up
A	yeah maybe
B	see how you go
A	we'll see how we go with that
B	yeah are you going to see the GP this week? Make an appointment? I was going to send you that link actually
A	yeah I
B	you're not though are you? I mean you are eating quite healthily generally speaking you're not eating an awful lot
A	mm
B	to boost your metabolism
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	sexy little top
B	so what are you going to wear down there tomorrow?
A	I'm wearing this
B	oh
A	with this black vest and this top
B	oh yeah you did show me that yeah it's cute
A	em I'm gonna take this in my handbag
B	mm
A	just so if it's cold I'm just gonna shove it over
B	yeah
A	em and black tights and my flat boots
B	which are somewhere safe
A	yeah god knows where the hell they are they might be in the hall
B	I ate them
A	you ate my beautiful black boots?
B	so I was texting what I thought was your number earlier I think I have about four different numbers for you because I think I've got the old number which I thought I'd deleted
A	did anyone reply?
B	well someone did reply to your number they said this is the wrong number and I was like oh my god I've got the thief I've got the thief
A	yeah

B	nothing

B	well it's a bit of a concern so I just that's what I deleted all the numbers that I had for you and when you text me saying I'm home I was like right that's
A	no well never
B	but that but if I open it it says no additional information for this contact
A	double three six three six five
B	yeah
A	that sounds like an old a number I know so I'm guessing it must be the old one
B	shall I try and call it? No cos that might be Stu
A	no
B	can't have that
A	but I think that might be my old one
B	right
A	so that's day number one outfit there
B	lovely
A	that's day number two outfit there and night outfit there
B	pantaloons
A	I'll have to put some washing later I think cos I

B	is that an issue? It's just your pjs
B	oh that's true
A	put them in the shower tomorrow
A	oh god I don't know what to do
B	well they're cute just wear those
A	em yeah I was gonna wear these but I'm thinking about the situation we discussed earlier
B	ah that is an issue
A	yeah

A	I mean either way what I wear is really not going to save me much is it?
B	well no
A	come worst case scenario time

A	it was like an inverted bob when that went into fashion three years ago
B	yeah
A	em and it was really long at this side but then short at this side so that side went behind my ear and that side was long

A	oh
B	and then a wonky chandelier
A	ah em
B	mm
A	em that
B	yeah
A	and em it's like for a spa package
B	yeah
A	for a night but it's the most amazing hotel I've ever seen like
B	oh
A	not not flamboyant as in amazing cos it's massive and its all full of stuff but it's eco design so it's basically designed to be self-sufficient and everything
B	wow
A	yeah it looks really good
B	where is that? Cornwall?
A	yeah
B	I think I've heard of that
A	it's called Scarlett

B	no photos of
A	that's that's that one
B	oh that's so pretty
A	yeah yeah
B	it's really nice
A	em and that one
B	oh
A	it's just basically just a plain
B	oh okay
A	it's em
B	it's very nice
A	looks like a cake
B	yeah it is a bit crazy isn't it? It's nice though so you've got stripes and circles
A	yeah like I don't know where the hell you would wear it
B	I have no idea
A	I wore it I wore it to em
B	tea parties?
A	yeah
A	they have like a final show
B	so what accessories did you wear with it?
A	I I don't I don't know
B	and what shoes did you wear?
A	Silver ones
B	yeah
A	and then I'm not allowed to wear the shoes unless I wear the dress
B	mm mm
A	so the silver silver slingbacks
B	mm
A	like it's a really young dress
B	it is a young dress yeah
A	and I haven't em
B	the pattern on it is very young yeah
A	it's a very young print
B	it's the sort of thing you don't want to get rid of because it's you know because of the memories attached to it
A	mm
B	there's nothing to say that you have to get rid of it
A	summer tea party
B	you could wear it to a tea party yeah
A	yeah
B	you'd have a tea party
A	we could do that
B	we can have a tea party
A	we can have a tea party
B	well to be honest I was looking at photos from last April Maz came over from Berlin and she stayed for the weekend and it was so hot
A	so I might even be able to wear it
B	so for your birthday we might even be able to have a tea party
A	that would be awesome
B	you could have like a Mad Hatter's tea party
A	that would be my favouritist thing ever
B	it would be pretty fun
A	Alice would probably wear something like this
B	I think she would wear exactly like that
A	Alice in Wonderland is my favourite Disney film ever
B	is it?
A	yep
B	mm
A	that would be my favourite birthday ever
B	we might have to
A	not just a tea party
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	as opposed to the film they've got mock turtles
A	yeah
B	so she looks like a turtle then obviously when they go so then they go out in the afternoon and have the tea party and she can be the turtle
A	oh
B	and then she's looking hot to trot
A	ah
B	it's quite good
A	oh yeah
B	but that hen party cost ninety pounds just for the day and the evening
A	what are people doing?
B	I don't know
A	oh
B	and then and that wasn't even including the dinner
A	that's a lot of money
B	or was it including dinner I can't remember
A	yeah
B	now I've started a precedent now I think I might carry on
A	that's that is extreme
B	well I mean I thought Barcelona was pretty bad
A	you just reminded me of something then
B	oh was it?
A	absolutely beautiful em
B	mm
A	is actually more like a wedding dress than her wedding dress
B	mm
A	it was completely plain
B	mm
A	straight down and ivory white done
B	wow
A	nothing else
B	right
A	like a the basque bit
B	mm
A	but she had this em thing made
B	oh okay
A	but it was completely sheer
B	oh
A	with like loads of embroidery all over it all the way round the edges covered covered covered in embroidery
B	wow
A	A bit like you know the royal wedding? She used a bit of embroidery
B	mm hm
A	it was like that but all down her arms
B	wow
A	all down her arms to here
B	oh my god
A	yeah
B	it sounds nice
A	yeah
B	cor that'd be expensive
A	I wanted I meant to ask
B	mm
A	that's probably about my build
B	mm
A	like she's quite she's a bit chubby but she's not
B	mm
A	she's just a bigger person generally
B	mm
A	and she she wasn't suited to what she was wearing at all
B	mm
A	no
B	oh really? That that that's what made it?
A	yeah
B	oh
A	really made it
B	yeah I can't em I can't imagine
A	lemon
B	basically yeah it's like a sort of yellowy colour as opposed to white
A	I feel a bit naked
B	yeah
A	do I look naked? I'm butt naked aren't I? Can't really wear this
B	you are quite naked
A	mm
B	but yeah it's not a traditional wedding dress by any means
A	yeah I do
B	we'll have to talk about it on Tuesday when you get paid
A	yes I do
B	we'll just sit down and work out logistics really but we could do it together because
A	mm
B	find our way to the wedding
A	these match don't they perfectly?
B	beautifully
A	right
B	Cos I'm sure she'll be fine with that
A	stupid o'clock
B	yeah
A	my favourite time of the morning
B	mm
A	yep
B	we're probably better off in Brixton
A	I think that's as far as my packing effort goes I think
B	it's pretty good
A	yeah
B	which is doable
A	mm
B	mm
A	and that one's going to be to big and that one's just easy to carry
B	yeah if you don't ram it full of stuff
A	yeah
B	mm
A	and I don't want
B	mm
A	I really don't know how I feel about this now
B	getting nervous
A	I'm not nervous I just don't especially because of the said situ and moods I'm just I don't want to I don't want to react to something badly
B	mm
A	do you know what I mean?
B	mm
A	I don't think I will
B	mm
A	em which by the way you may you may want in
B	what do you mean?
A	you may want in
B	mm
A	em there's an exhibition at the Design Museum Louboutin
B	mm
A	A retrospective exhibition
B	mm
A	of all the shoes
B	right
A	and all the like design influences of the shoes
B	mm
A	em and pictures and all sorts of stuff
B	mm
A	and it's the first one that they've ever done and he's got me two tickets to go
B	oh wow
A	I know
B	mm
A	unless I want I wouldn't really want to go in May cos I'm gonna go to eh I might be going to a wedding with Liz so
B	mm
A	the extra money I have that month will go for that
B	mm
A	and he was like okay well just let me know when you're free and I said okay
B	but but is does he mean that he would take you though? Is that not what he means?
B	shoe
A	the shoe bit
B	mm
A	so he was like so you might you know you might want to take someone else
B	mm
A	but you know and I'll go in something else and meet you afterwards
B	mm
A	which is fine
B	yeah
A	em
B	so what you do? Would you go down for the day do you think?
A	yeah
B	mm
A	but it was like and he just thought that would be nice cos that you know obviously cos I won't see you on your birthday
B	mm
A	and I said oh right why won't you?
B	mm
A	and he was like em well you know cos I said
B	right
A	I think I think I said keep free
B	right
A	for the weekend before and the weekend after
B	mm
A	and I said if we do that it'll prob it'll be a girls'
B	weekend
A	holiday
B	but then he hasn't written it on the calendar
A	yeah and he's not asked
B	he's still not asked her?
A	no
B	that's a bit weird
A	yeah I don't really understand what's going on with them like
B	mm
A	I don't know I just
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	mm
B	but yeah I mean if if he did if he's just completely blocked out the rest of the next nine months to see
A	innit?
B	but then it's all supposed to be that way isn't it? Like typically you don't stay this close with your ex-boyfriend or girlfriends
A	yeah but it's birthday time
B	yeah but then if you're seeing somebody else like you you don't know what you might be doing in April like you might be seeing somebody he might be more serious with
A	yeah
B	like if you were just best mates maybe you would just hang out just the two of you but
A	yeah whatever it is
B	whatever is going on it's hard for anybody new
A	and he said em
B	Good job you said it was a girlie thing
A	yeah and that we'd do something else
B	mm
A	yeah
B	it hurts
A	yeah
B	mm mm mm
A	I just want it to go smoothly without a hitch and then
B	walk away
A	have some nice photographs
B	well I don't you know I don't think it needs to be it
A	no
B	so yeah all being well you know you'll have a nice time and then you'll just come back and
A	yeah but before said space I want to leave
B	mm yeah of course
A	so

B	oh
A	I was just about to say oh god I haven't got you a birthday present well yeah you have
B	you've got quite quite a decent one
A	fucking eejit
B	quite nice
A	yes thanks
B	A little jolly
A	it's closed
B	ah what? Why?
A	till further notice
A	yeah I don't know
B	shit
A	so going for the egg hunt
B	ah
A	I'm going to make go the egg hunt
B	ah that's pretty fun
A	yeah so that should be a nice thing to do
B	mm
A	I said just have a look and we'll see what you want to do and we'll do we'll do it
[ANNOTATION]	Most eggs are painted pastel colours, but the store sells more colourful ones.	Neutral
B	mm
A	yeah I think it's going to be a bit of a whistle-stop tour
B	mm
A	which is good
B	yeah
A	yeah I don't I don't want to get too too knackered like I'm thinking
B	mm
A	you know a bit of a just a rest a breather
B	mm
A	and then go and do the egg hunters you know a couple of hours
B	mm
A	and then the have a leisurely just wander around the Tate Modern get on the train do you know?
B	mm
A	not let's do all this and run around cos I can't be arsed with that shit
B	what it's just very knackering and I don't think you actually see anything in any great detail you know if you wanted to go the Tate Modern you should just take half a day or a whole day
[ANNOTATION]	To actually see all that that museum of London has to offer, people should spend there at least half a day, perhaps more.	Entailment
A	yeah
B	then do it
A	that's what I thought
B	it's a pretty a pretty impressive place
A	is it?
B	the Tate Modern yeah yeah cos there's an old turbine hall so it's massive
A	is it?
[ANNOTATION]	The shop is closed at the moment, and there is no specific date when it will open.	Entailment
B	it's really massive yeah
A	oh yeah
B	and he's supposed to be like on the run now
A	there was sand all over the floor?
B	yeah
A	and this a massive hall?
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B says that this museum used to be a beer factory,	Contradiction
B	yeah
A	wow
B	yeah and you could go walk on it and then they said you couldn't walk on it and then they just took it all away
A	motherfuckers
B	yeah no well I'm the same particularly like modern art
A	yeah em
[ANNOTATION]	The Tate Modern has a twin museum in the city where you can see completely different things.	Neutral
B	I'd rather go and watch a play watch a movie read a book
A	yeah
B	I don't really understand art
A	yeah
B	unmade bed
A	yeah
B	knocked down shed etcetera
A	yeah
B	what is that? Light on and off
A	it's yeah yeah
B	mm
A	that's why I used to like looking at
B	mm
A	the thought process behind it was the interesting bit that I liked
B	you could see how he'd got there
A	yeah
B	I like when you go and see art now and they've got like a little accompanying note and it's just words put together in a sentence
A	no
B	you've just put that into a sentence that's not actually making any sense for anybody
A	no which is stupid stupid
B	mm
A	he booked Cte
B	what's Cte?
A	you know eh the French bistro thing? There's one in Cambridge
B	cte? No I don't know
A	yeah C O T E with a little hat on the E
B	mm
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	oh okay yeah
A	yeah well I've
B	it's look nice from the outside
A	I went there once and we just had like a sandwich cos it was lunch time
B	mm
A	but it wasn't much to write home about
B	is that the one on the corner on
A	it's the one it's
B	Cos they're a few that opened
A	yeah
B	the last couple of years and there's one that's on the corner that looks quite nice
A	I don't know
B	Cos it used to be an American diner and you used to sit in like old nineteen fifties cars when we first moved to Cambridge about four or five years ago
A	yeah
B	but it was quite fun and obviously like playing Elvis records all the time but I think it was an independent and it just closed down and then yeah
A	I can't remember if it's the corner one
B	but like a brasserie type place opened up and it was on the corner but I never I never looked that closely
A	there's a couple in a row
B	mm
A	they blur into one
B	yeah
A	Cos they
B	Cos then cos you've got Chez Gerard and you've got Café Rouge then you've got a couple more
A	yeah
B	and there that sort of stretch of restaurants
A	so I was a bit like oh
B	so it's not something special then?
A	no
B	I mean it's difficult isn't it? Somewhere like London where you've got so much choice
A	yeah
B	maybe he knows that the dinners there are quite nice
A	God knows
B	mm
A	but then it seems a shame to go to London and eat in the hotel
B	yeah really
A	so even though we do only pay fifty percent for it so the food is just like it's basically á la carte dining for next to nothing
B	mm
A	for two people two courses you're looking at a hundred and twenty quid
B	wow
A	we pay sixty
B	that's really good
A	yeah
B	really good
A	you kind of should do it for the just to be able to but it's there's no point
B	mm hmm
A	there's no point in going down to London if you're just going to stay in the hotel
B	that's pretty sweet
A	that's a winner
B	and you get half the price on the bar as well don't you?
A	yeah
B	cheeky cocktail
A	I think cheeky vino may be required
B	I don't know if I don't
A	em
B	are you
A	yes
B	oh
A	red vino
B	red vino
A	oh do you?
B	yeah
A	why?
B	I don't I don't know I don't know if he what he's going to be like
A	eh who's he? Who is he?
B	eh his name's
A	go
B	go?
A	he might act
A	yes
B	mime possibly
A	well that would be the winner if someone mimed
B	or and then then drawing
A	or
B	caricature artist
A	yeah pull out paper and just
B	mm I don't they freak me out those things but yes
A	yeah
B	so it was
A	we have tea now?
[ANNOTATION]	person A is not sure that have tea or not	Entailment
B	tea? Shall we make tea?
A	no I don't mean cup of tea I mean eating tea
B	oh
A	I had
A	I think I just felt I just thought I felt a bit sick then that's probably why
B	you haven't eaten all day you absolute maniac no wonder if you're hungry
A	Good
B	so just some sort of wrap really not a fajita in any sense shape or form
A	right
B	I had two of those
A	goodo
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about tea	Entailment
B	I've eaten loads of food
A	goodo
B	where's your food? No wonder you feel sick
A	I feel like I
B	yeah
A	everything there's gonna go off if I don't use it
B	get it in
A	yeah I can't do that
[ANNOTATION]	they are not sure about sick	Neutral
B	Don't do that
A	no it's just minestrone again I just can't be able to make it
B	it seems unlikely given that you've only got an hour to get ready
A	oh dear
B	em did the house smell when you came home?
A	eh I wasn't smelling I wasn't prepared to smell
B	but I think if it had smelt you would have smelled it
A	no
B	oh have you?
A	yeah really really bad
B	you've got to be aware of smelling have you?
A	no sometimes I don't smell I can't smell like I can't smell now
B	right
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about book	Contradiction
A	em basically if I I think I don't know how I worked this out but I think I only have a sense of smell up one nostril
B	right
A	so like I'm a bit snotty today
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about today	Entailment
B	mm
A	Cos I I automatically am from smoking the night before
B	mm
A	I can't really smell very much
B	right
A	Cos I don't I don't know I just don't cos I've always had it
B	okay
A	it's so weird isn't it?
[ANNOTATION]	person A is weird	Neutral
B	well I suppose it's like my not thinking that I could possibly be allergic to apples until you said that your face gets hot and tingly and hot and red when you eat chocolate and you think that's probably because you're allergic to it
A	yeah
B	never flagged it as an issue and now I think god
A	I just
B	well I can't smell at the moment because of the cold but
A	I must be able to smell cos part of your taste and smell
B	yeah yeah
A	and I can just taste so it's just it's very
B	it's just lessens
A	it's I don't know
B	than everyone else's maybe? It's just not hyper-sensitive
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	if I'm clear if I'm nasally clear
B	yeah
A	like
B	sinusitis
A	rhinoitis
B	what the fuck is that?
A	it's called Rhinusitis but it's basically
B	rhinoitis
A	turn in to rhino
B	turn it to rhino
A	it's em
B	that's madness
A	yeah
B	okay
A	A bit like hay fever
B	mm
A	so I just assumed it's gone away but I think the non smell thing
B	mm
A	is probably part of that which is a bit weird
B	it is a bit weird isn't it?
A	yeah
B	I smelt it the other day one day
A	I put loads of bleach down the drain
B	mm
A	I think it was something stuck in the drain
B	possibly cos it doesn't
A	did you get anything from town
B	eh just some birthday cards and oh
A	mm
B	I did
A	right
B	it's quite young
A	it's got a lot better recently
B	we'll it always used to be okay and then it got quite chav and now I think it might be it's like borderline
A	yeah
B	but it's also quite young
A	yeah it's very young and I think now it's really overpriced
B	yeah
A	used to be less expensive than Topshop
B	yeah
A	and now they're on pretty an even par but there's not the same design or the same quality
B	yeah I think and the yeah the quality of the material is just not there
A	ah
B	so it was quite interesting and it looked like sort of gold finishing on the sleeve and I could see it online and it was twenty quid so I thought that would be quite good I'd wear it with leggings and heels maybe if I go out or just slobbing around or whatever
A	like that skirt?
B	it's not cotton
A	like thick satin or?
B	yeah but just really cheap
A	ah
B	and so it sticks out and just looks really weird and like the I quite like the the clash of the monochrome and the floral coloured pattern at the bottom
A	ah
B	and everyone was just stopping in my way and I wanted to punch everybody in the head
A	Saturday's in town are just the worst
B	yeah I every weekend you know every time I go in on a Saturday I think why do I do this to myself?
A	no bad
B	if I go
A	that's fine
B	done
A	no that no
B	I don't know you were
A	A little potter around
B	little bit of a potter
A	oh
B	mm
A	em to take for the weekend which I thought would be nice
B	mm
A	I mean the more I think about it I think in actual fact what's what's really happening here is
B	mm
A	and I really don't think whatever the outcome is I'm going to be satisfied with it really
B	mm
A	so I think I probably need to prepare for that a bit
B	well I think realistically at this point you want him to just turn around and say I love you let's get back together
A	yep
B	because
A	but it's not going to work that's the thing
B	mm
A	that the way you're behaving
B	mm
A	is not a person that I want in my want to be with
B	well absolutely yeah
A	yeah
B	and also you know the fact that he would jack in something with
A	yeah
B	but
A	I don't know why I think it
B	yeah I think you have to prepare yourself that really there's a good chance that something's going to happen this week that's going to hurt
A	mm
B	you know yeah
A	no
B	Cos worst you know the best
A	yeah
B	but that's still going to hurt though
A	mm
B	if you have anything less than a good weekend that's gonna hurt for whatever reason makes it a not good weekend
A	yeah
B	yeah which is what I've been saying for weeks
A	yes I know
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	so
A	I
B	mm
A	because he's not behaving well towards me so I kinda think that that just tarnishes
B	mm
A	tarnishes what we had and I don't think he's really
B	I'm British Gas calling
A	and like the when we're going away like Navyness and whatever I kinda think like he doesn't care that he's not going to see me
B	mm
A	yeah
B	long term
A	yeah
B	it's just you know that your plan for today
A	yeah
B	today I will oh I know I'll join the navy
A	yeah
B	it don't know if it's a
A	I've always like to do that
B	no I haven't I mean I think I might shit myself a tiny tiny bit
A	would you?
B	I hate flying
A	oh yeah of course
B	but loose
A	no I probably wouldn't do that if I were you
B	no
A	but then you wouldn't get to see very much
B	oh no cos I'm quite tall
A	no
B	so I could sit here
A	no
B	it is
A	is it?
B	I don't know I've
A	are they that shallow?
B	I've never been on one
A	no
B	in which case I'd want to sit down
A	I think it comes to the boobage
B	yeah but that's
A	no
B	okay well that would make me feel more secure
A	it would probably be about here on you
B	okay
A	ish
B	I'd still want some sort of harness
A	strap yourself into the hot air balloon
B	yeah exactly and then I can't be used as a ballast
A	yeah
B	throw her out
A	what was that? Oh my just that you reminded me
B	mm
A	and I was like they can't you know you say you can't join the Navy like because you're fat
A	it was really funny
B	mm
A	that was funny
B	devastating
A	I need I need this make up off my face
B	mm
A	em
B	oh I saw your moisturizer on discount at Boots but I remembered you said it smelled like porridge
A	oh this one?
B	mm
A	yeah it smells like porridge but it's really good though
B	is it? Does it smell of porridge?
A	yeah
B	I like porridge
A	it em
B	so no sign of the car key then so you couldn't go in the house?
A	go around the house
B	Nofo's
A	it's really good it just it's a bedtime one like it
B	yeah
A	once it's
B	oh okay
A	and the next day I don't smell of
B	right so not one for first thing in the morning
A	no
B	I do I moisturize normally when I get out of the shower so that might sometimes be in the morning
A	I em
B	no
A	no
B	I saw Ten Years Younger today
A	oh yeah
B	oh my god the woman she had a chemical peel and laser surgery around her lips because her skin was so bad like obviously her lips were really puckered from where she'd been smoking all those years
A	yeah my mum's are not horrendous but bad
B	and she was from Glasgow you know they have like the highest rate em of skin cancer there
A	really?
B	yeah
A	everyone's on smack
B	everyone's on smack they like deep fried Mars bars
A	have you ever had one?
B	etcetera etcetera
A	I haven't either
B	it sounds like hell
A	it does sound like hell
B	em I my worry would be that I'd get addicted and I'd need one every day and then my heart would go bye bye
A	bye bye now
A	and delete
B	okay
A	I went for sausage club yesterday
B	it was so good
A	yeah?
B	get a second mortgage on that house to pay for your breakfast
A	shut up
B	and I was like hold the phone Michael
A	yeah
B	probably cos he knows the rest are fucking retards and they undercharge
A	and you'll just say alright
B	yeah
B	doing him out of shit loads of money all the time anyway so he's like well I've got to make it back somehow
A	oh yeah absolutely
B	it's really funny
A	chicken crumble?
B	yeah so it was crumble but with like a like imagine like a chicken pie
A	yeah
B	sauce or whatever
A	yeah
B	and then you'd have a pie on top or around it
A	yeah
B	it was good
A	yeah
B	so that's just gonna have to eh
A	that's in order
B	be ignored
A	that's a big difference isn't it?
B	it is a big difference like you can have a bowl soup
A	oh
B	like a small bowl of soup there's not actually that much difference in quantity
A	yeah
B	but it's its price so you might as well get a small bowl
A	they say that at work
B	oh
A	but
B	did you not get the food they serve to the guests?
A	oh no do we fuck
B	oh
A	oh no
B	who cooks your food then? Have they got a special company in do they?
A	no
B	it's the same chefs then?
A	yeah
B	mm
A	so it's like monkfish and duck and
B	nice
A	other shit
B	mm
A	and the lunch bar it's like well burgers or pizza are fine
B	for their staff?
A	yeah
B	right
A	so it's a really really vast different
B	mm
A	and fried chicken
B	mm
A	the junk food only gets
B	mm
A	which I don't understand
B	really?
A	and then the other two options to go with it would be rice and naan bread
B	mm
A	where's the vegetable?
B	mm
A	there's no healthy option if you wanted to eat healthily you can't
B	that's really bad
A	or the the other day lasagne
B	mm
A	with chips
A	carbs on carbs with
B	garlic bread
A	garlic bread
B	was it really?
A	yeah
B	that's hilarious
A	and they're like the housekeepers need that stodge to keep them going cos they do a really physical job no they don't
B	bollocks
A	nobody's body is made for that
B	mm
A	yeah
B	you know
A	but they just don't
B	I mean I can't really complain about our canteen it is it is good
A	all that shit
B	it's massive but you are feeding over a thousand people
A	yeah
B	so the you
A	yeah
B	so it's easier to feed more people so
A	yeah I know this is absolute cack although I must admit because of all the complaining I've been doing
B	and you're on that board thing are you? The gossip board?
A	the gossip board
B	Good
A	I went did I tell you I went to Holiday Inn last week with the gossip board?
B	oh you said went to the Holiday Inn? Yeah
A	yeah that was because of the gossip board
B	mm
A	that was quite nice
B	that was a whole day out was it or part of the day?
A	three hours I think
B	mm
A	yeah it was a bit a bit of a change of scenery
B	oh so what does that mean? Like finding a charity to sponsor or doing campaigns to raise money?
A	yeah
B	sponsors a
A	sponsors a charity
B	yeah
A	this year I can't even tell you what it is
B	mm
A	have you heard of this before?
B	I've heard of Shelter is it different?
A	it's it's
B	it's everything it's Africa
A	it's it's
B	Oxfam? Cafod? Water Aid?
A	eh eh
B	save the Children NSPCC
A	it's it's something like that it's one of those but it's not those
B	cancer Research?
A	no
B	RSPCA? RNIB?
A	it helps
B	RNLI
A	it helps loads of
B	UN no not UN? Oh
A	oh I can't fucking remember
A	but yeah anyway it doesn't do that like last year
B	yeah
A	which is basically the charity of the children with chairs
B	wow
A	because people could really relate to it so when you're doing things you knew you could quantify what you're giving to somebody
B	mm
A	so people really got into it
B	mm
A	but now it's like well what does the charity do? I don't really know
B	right
A	which is the part that I've we're supposedly going in as shelter in a storm
B	mm well that's good
A	but then
B	that's what they need
A	well yeah but
B	mm
A	all over the world
B	mm
A	these people provide accommodation no matter what
B	mm
A	all the time like that's just as
B	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Person B is thinking that how they provide house	Entailment
A	it
B	tenuous link
A	yeah
B	is it Amnesty International?
A	no
B	world is it like The World Aid Organisation or World or something? Mate you probably should know this
A	I know
B	the thing is they've probably have you this and you've probably gone yeah it's interesting
A	no they haven't actually
B	have they not?
A	I don't know if they've told the management team but they certainly haven't told us yet
B	because that's well that's what you need to know isn't it? Otherwise there's no point
A	there's no direction
[ANNOTATION]	Person A think that did not tell them anything	Entailment
B	mm
A	so it just it just seems a waste of time
A	yes to death
B	what? Why?
[ANNOTATION]	Person B asks why Person A is thinking that is a time wasting	Entailment
A	have I told you that? I think Africa is just like I can't even don't even know what's going on there
B	what
A	I have told you this before
B	mm
A	I can't really accept that that's real and I know it is but because I've just I find it so horrific
B	mm
A	I've just
B	right
A	which makes me sound awful
[ANNOTATION]	Person A is going to have a sandwich	Contradiction
B	mm
A	and I know it does but it's just it's so it's so bad
B	mm
A	it's like space you know I just I
B	well I mean it's horrific and it is difficult to understand that in this day and age you know in Somalia kids are dying every day
A	yeah
B	hundreds and thousands of people are dying every day and yet there's absolutely no need for it
A	yeah
B	you know needlessly through lack of water through drinking dirty water through lack of immunization you know it's it's happening all the time at at a time when we've cured all of these diseases
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Person A is going to dance	Contradiction
B	but we let it run wild out there because it's just not financially viable for us to do anything about it
A	yeah
B	so if we see something we're like oh that's just the TV I'll just block that out
A	but do you not think and this is this makes me sound like Hitler
B	right
A	which I know that
[ANNOTATION]	Person A is feeling so bad about the things that Person C said	Contradiction
B	mm
A	but we weren't educated we were cavemen too
B	mm
A	and it's just because our environment is habitable that we've been able to evolve and learn these things like
B	mm
A	it's not it's not
B	yeah
A	it's not supposed to so no matter how much
B	mm
B	mm
A	and really I can't I can't help but think right that if maybe if maybe no one was throwing money at it
B	mm
B	mm
A	anyway
B	yeah
A	I just wish that maybe thousands of years ago hundreds of years ago when people started throwing money at the problem they didn't throw money at it so it never developed
B	I
A	I can't understand how it got to this now
B	I don't know
A	yeah
B	through the last thousands of years as man's evolved we've all come from Africa
A	yeah
B	so why it happened that you know obviously in the west we evolved more quickly we maybe it was because our terrain was much more habitable and we were able to do that
A	are you being serious?
B	yeah
A	fuck
B	they're there on behalf of you know the pillaging armies now they're gonna go
A	holy
B	the women are going to be raped the children are going to get killed and the men are gonna be enslaved
A	mm
B	though the issue I have is this idea of natural selection
A	yeah
B	and obviously because of their they they don't have access to condoms men
A	yeah
B	so they're constantly having babies
A	no
B	they're constantly having babies they're more and more babies being brought into a world that that can't sustain them
A	yeah
B	at a time when we could have done something about it
A	yeah
B	nothing was really done
A	no
B	and so now it's got to a point where I we can't really fix it
A	yeah
B	so really it's really hard but technology has come so far that you could actually transform the landscape if you wanted to
A	yeah that's true
B	they could you know
A	yeah
B	greenhouses whatever it takes
A	but you can't you can't give that
B	invent clouds to come over
A	but you can't
B	no but they're not stupid do you know what I mean? They just haven't been afforded the opportunity because we we're in the west and we're special and we've got the tools and we want to make our money ourselves
A	well someone must say to those men to rape is wrong and they don't understand that
B	but no But no I don't think anybody is because they're just being left to their own devices
A	but how can they think that's right? Like in our in in England
B	because they're because they are barbaric in the sense that they haven't got they haven't been through the same civilization that we have
A	but they must talk to each other
B	our armies go in and pillage
A	like they they can communicate so
B	it's not about
A	so when the woman says no don't do that
B	and he thinks that that's okay much like in a country that we think is more developed for example Saudi Arabia like they they stone women in the middle east still
A	yeah
B	you know everyone every country really is at a different level of development civilization
A	mm
B	we shouldn't be however hundreds of countries there are because we're not helping each other
A	yeah
B	do these these people in Somalia are dying and it's so unnecessary
A	yeah
B	and obviously you've got people in Haiti you know and they're still in Port Au Prince they're still living in shanty towns
A	in fucking New Orleans they're still living in tents
B	yeah
A	yeah I don't really get it
B	well no that's and I think that's why people have such a have such difficulty in in relating to it because it is so far away
A	and then I have to go and then put the video on and I start crying
B	I know I can't watch the adverts on TV
A	and then we had to watch this video and I'm sat there bawling
B	yeah
A	and I thought to out of everyone to send to the charity meeting
B	mm
A	really

B	that is just really moving though isn't it? I mean that I mean that that's why they do it
A	mm
B	because they want to affect you
B	well I mean that's a good enough reason to try and understand it isn't it? You know if you think well I don't understand that maybe maybe I should read something more about it like I think if I watch something on TV
A	mm
B	the idea that someone is dying every three seconds unnecessarily
A	yeah like you saying it and I know you're not lying but it just sounds like a lie
