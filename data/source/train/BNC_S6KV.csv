B	yeah have you got ants in your pants?
A	you right click one of the options is manual and you manual for the game onto computer and just read it
B	oh
A	but the manual for Civilization tends to be the original Civilization games had manuals that were like five hundred pages long and they came with huge charts and everything it was great
B	great? are you mad? if you were like insane
A	they'd give you a big poster of all the charts of all the of all the er
B	do they still do they do they still have that?
A	I might have one for Civilization 4 somewhere but that's not no good for you
B	I'll I'll check I'll

A	see I always play
C	mm
B	at the same time?
A	everyone tries to beat me up and I just
A	and then my culture assimilates all the surrounding cities and things like this and I've built all the wonders of the world and this kind of stuff
B	the things for me is though I don't really understand how to get culture or science like I don't know what gives you culture or science and where all the things that stay down below I don't really read all of them the because otherwise I'm just mind boggled

B	I'd like to thank daddy pig er mum
A	for the office
A	for the office
C	white shirts
A	like more than one?
D	mummy
C	no two
A	not like seventeen or anything like
B	okay
C	they come in packs of two
B	oh okay that makes more sense
C	and erm and trousers but will you try them on and see if they fit alright? cos I got them from M and S just to see if the might be better than cos the other ones split they every time and I keep
A	what do you do and like?
C	I don't know I'm asking you what are you doing?
B	I know I have told you and you don't believe me I literally
A	what?
B	I like actually I dropped some rubbish
B	and I bent I pick it up
A	yeah
B	rip
B	you're not believing me do you think I do the splits? I can't do the splits
B	I think this is this is
B	this is my reasoning
B	I think because I'm small and because it's the smallest size
C	I dunno
A	just er short short
B	I've got I've just got the I'm short I think it's gonna be a bit embarrassing
B	I think the
D	Peppa Pig
B	as in like
B	yes like that is like smaller and it's like so cos like cos I'm older it's like different
B	so basically what I'm saying
A	so what are you saying? is you've got a big arse is that what you're saying?
B	no I'm saying that er
B	because I'm a bit short it's a bit like tighter
C	cos I don't want them to be too small trousers either
B	yeah
C	cos then they'll rip again but
B	cos it if they're too if
A	so they're a bit tight are they?
B	yeah tight there we go
B	they're not tight on my legs but like when you bend when I bend down
A	the
B	the front one
A	okay
C	okay but don't take off the label until you try them on
B	okay
C	so that I can take them back
A	do we have to get him to pick somebody off the ground?
A	just to test them out?
B	what I
C	every time and I was sitting there like sewing
A	couldn't you could we
B	well
C	no he's shown me it's like proposing
B	the only way
B	the only way you can
C	it's like where you're like down on one knee?
B	the only way for you to understand it's like
A	right
B	pick the rubbish up
D	really?
B	if I was to not like break break break my pants I would
A	trousers whichever
B	I'd have to do this
A	so
A	yeah
A	but that doesn't really
A	that doesn't really explain
D	Chewbacca
A	how how how the pink and blue and purple marks
C	oh yeah
A	are on the shirts cos this
D	Chewbacca
B	oh no
B	that's art
