A	like a family party thing and like it's sort of totally fucked like you can say that stuff like to people who like you don't know and whatever but it's really awkward for me and I'm like sitting next to her and she's saying it do you know what I mean?
B	yeah
A	like what are you talking about?
B	yeah you just have to go along with it I guess
A	I know obviously I do yeah
B	yeah
A	it makes you feel weird
B	like some people just have that impulse I guess I think
A	yeah but it's quite yeah
B	everyone's kind of well I used to be like that in primary school
A	yeah everyone says that in primary school they're like
B	yeah but
A	this one time like yeah
B	I yeah but I guess it's
A	it's like constant one-up one-upmanship but like you soon grow out of it
B	yeah
A	or not you know
B	yeah I think she's in her like first year of college now I think right? She was like do you want to go to a twenty-four hour library with me? I was like where? and she was like
A	isn't your library twenty-four hours?
B	no are you fucking
A	it's not bad
B	no the closest I have is
A	all the libraries all the college libraries are twenty-four hours there's like one where you can see it's like on the outside of the like public can see the windows and stuff it's like by the river like when you go over the bridge you can see the library you go over the bridge at like three AM it's just like full
B	lol do you like it a bit more now?
A	no
B	do you hate it a lot more?
A	well I don't really I
B	I remember you told me before you went that you could spend your third year in
A	I could if I wanted to I know people who have done that but I can't
B	why can't you?
A	cos like to be honest I don't want to do that because
B	you just want to finish it there
A	yeah it's better I get better teachers and stuff and more attention
B	yeah I wish I got more attention that's all I want
A	but I don't go you once said that you went to coffee with your teachers and stuff
B	yeah true
A	I don't do that
B	yeah are you jealous?
A	no but like you must get quite a lot of attention cos there are only like sixty people on the course
B	yeah I do get attention yeah yeah but like yeah I don't know
A	have you stayed the night here yet?
B	no but I hang out here all the time even all my friends like yeah she's still nice she like if it wasn't for her I would have like failed last year because I couldn't find the exam hall and like she like came out like the exam had started already and she like ran out and like
A	do you have exams again?
B	yeah
A	man I looked at my papers they're so hard
B	really?
A	it's like what?
B	mm I think you sent me like a question that was like fucked up or something I feel like that must be fun like thinking of like how you're going to like fuck them up this year
A	oh my days like classics paper's fine some of like the like ones there was like a practical criticism question on the English paper poem that had no words it was just punctuation
B	no why? that's funny
A	I know but it's like now write about that for an hour you like clever like smart-arses
B	oh my god you can't do that for an actual exam maybe like a
A	they do that they do that in the exam
B	how like?
A	let's just do the best and that's like totally sort of arbitrary whether the examiner thinks like it's good or not
B	I guess like if they studied something
A	but that's the thing cos people were annoyed cos they didn't study it for it
B	mm
A	it is a kind of like you spend so long like revising and working and they do something
B	yeah you can kind of link anything to anything though I think this year I'm going to have a question which is like just one word everyone gets that for like one of their things so it'll be like chance or something and you just have to go lol yeah well is
A	yeah
B	I was thinking maybe I'll do like an MFA in like actual art but it sounds fucking scary like you have to do like have a portfolio and shit
A	yeah
B	don't know why probably go on Tumblr and like copy and paste shit onto a
A	yeah it's not so easy though
B	do you think so?
A	yeah yeah
B	but it it does sound quite competitive to cos like if you're coming from like
A	well it depends where do you want to do it?
B	somewhere good if it's not somewhere good then I won't do it I don't know like
A	but if you
B	yeah I know I'm just like thinking
A	just like start practising drawing
B	yeah I don't think I could do that shit I don't know
A	quite cool I think it would fun to go to do like art school thing afterwards but
B	yeah
B	I think yeah it is a lot about like technical I don't know
A	but I remember doing I'm like I can
B	yeah yeah I remember that baby you made
A	I still have that
B	really?
A	it's facing the wall in my bedroom
B	lol what happened did you win like a Saatchi prize or something?
A	yeah
B	lol
A	it's on the Saatchi website
B	lol yeah I feel like a lot of people will be doing like MFA
A	I'll just put that in my thing
B	yeah a lot of people who do these like who have these technical skills they like use them for like graphic design to like
A	yeah they go and like work for Pixar and stuff
B	yeah
A	which would be fun actually

A	she's trying to go out with you
B	yeah and I'm just like I would go out but I just don't want to wear a suit
A	you have to wear a suit
B	to go to the
A	you don't have to
B	you do
B	that's the only other alternative for me
A	well yeah I guess but why why you could say oh well I'm not I don't mind going out with you but I'm not wearing a suit
B	it's not up to her
A	yeah I know but like just go somewhere else instead of like
B	lol it's like everywhere that like is worth going for her is like that but yeah
A	what even Café Rouge?
B	no I didn't mean like that I mean like going out going out
A	oh like clubs
B	yeah that's what I mean yeah I know

A	yeah
B	freedom for what you wear is important
A	that was one of the fun things about fashion you could

A	their job is so you don't have to do that
B	yeah
A	just join that army or something

A	no they don't honestly everyone knows that
B	yeah even with like creative writing I don't know where is like good in England like
A	there's isn't there isn't in England just don't do it in England
B	that's why I'd be like I was just gonna like do my master's in art history and then just do whatever but I'm so fucking tired of art history
A	what about philosophy man?
B	yeah I was thinking of that too but like
A	I think it's the only really worthwhile postgraduate study in a way
B	yeah
A	if you're not doing it to like I don't know it's like really good stuff you'll like have that forever
B	I really wish I did that before like cos I was like trying to just decide between art history and philosophy I was just like I'm gonna do art history just because of like the image of the
B	but I think you actually need to be clever for philosophy
A	yeah it's really hard that doesn't mean you can't do it
B	I don't know also I don't know where I would do it like
A	even like I don't know
B	there's this cool like school of philosophy called the Kyoto School
A	in Japan?
B	it's like it's like merging like old Buddhist stuff with like modern philosophy it's like during the eighties or nineties or something
A	what?

B	I like how you can like
A	it's funny it's more fun
B	yeah
A	do you know what I mean? like hotels are funny and fun they're weirder
B	I know what you mean but like
B	I like the idea of like imagining that I live somewhere permanently
A	I remember like I stayed in one Airbnb in Mexico City and it was just like the same price it was actually more expensive than a hotel and like so much worse
B	really?
A	so we went to a hotel afterwards and it was was much better
B	cos the apartment I found for Tokyo is like so nice

A	yeah even in Paris because the euro's really weak
B	yeah yeah true
A	it's like used to be one euro twenty for a pound now it's one euro forty
B	I don't know what that means
