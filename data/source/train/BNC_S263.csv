C	yeah
A	fresh there's no particular I like it quite non no taste not well just a slight
C	it's very like a a Sauvignon Blanc
A	mm
C	and actually the French do do a Sauvignon now
A	yeah
C	I think I think
A	I thought it was French Sauvignon is a French word isn't it?
C	well it it is yes
A	or is that the place is that the grape?
C	yes yeah
A	oh god
C	no no it's er
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	but that's French though isn't it?
C	but
A	mm
C	but yes the they but the the thing is that nowadays the countries that one really associates with Sauvignon Blanc is er is actually New Zealand
A	oh I see what you mean
C	yeah yeah
A	yes
C	well they're the ones who actually grow the grape
A	but it must have originated yeah
C	version but the grape version is called Sauvignon Blanc
A	to have the name though
C	yeah
A	must have been
C	yeah
A	originate
C	yeah
A	originally French
C	yes yeah
A	yes
C	yeah I shall go up to the loo?

C	yes yes I mean there were four courses because there was a you know the the fish the soup course
A	yeah
C	then fish then meat then pud
A	oh that's a bit ridiculous
C	yeah well I mean no wonder I left weighing about
C	barely getting into
A	you can see why
C	oh the food was superb
A	I'm sure and it
C	well
A	when food becomes an entertainment in its own right
C	well yes I mean it was
A	and it's enjoyable to eat it
C	yeah it was
A	and
C	a theatrical experience actually
A	yes the whole thing
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A thinks the 4-course menu is thrilling.	Contradiction
C	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Speakers do not enjoy the courses as an experience.	Contradiction
A	yeah I'm sure which your cruise is going to be
C	exactly yes
A	erm and I hope you've got posh evening
C	oh yes
A	dresses and things
C	yes
A	and maybe
C	I've got two or three
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker C has been in many cruises so far.	Neutral
A	you might have to consult your neighbour with the you know the clothes that she gives away maybe she can
A	pass some more on to you
C	yes yeah
C	well she has actually
A	cos you're going to need them
C	she's she's passed me on er several sweaters just recently
A	mm
C	.and and and of which two or three are cashmere
C	and the others
A	how much does she spend on clothes?
C	yeah yeah and the others are you know fine quality lambswool
A	and she's always absolutely immaculately
C	yeah
A	dressed
C	yes yeah
A	got very good taste but expensive
C	well I'm gonna stick my earrings in now that sounds a bit silly but I have been in the habit of not wearing earrings
A	mm
C	er you know for a long time and then find that I couldn't get an earring
A	have they closed up?
C	yeah but I went back thinking I'd have to get them re-pierced but er
A	yeah
C	the lady in the shop manages to sort of
A	yeah
C	get it in and I kept it in for a fortnight
A	yes
C	but she did say you know wear them but what a difference it makes actually
A	why did you stop?
C	well I mean out in Greece I tend not to wear them you know
A	mm
C	if I'm just sort of slogging around at home and I don't I tend to think of the you know going out put earring this was the ear that was the problem one actually
A	I haven't got the earlobes
C	oh now just
A	I don't think
C	yeah
A	I've got enough room for pierced ears
C	have you not oh let me see
A	hardly anything there
C	oh no oh right you've got
A	there's nothing there though is there?
C	yeah yeah
C	no cos yeah
A	so
C	yeah
A	but I always found them I once got them pierced and found it really uncomfortable
C	did you?
A	yeah horrible
A	because you've got the other side of it
C	oh right it's yes in the
A	and it digs in
C	oh yeah
A	if you're
C	yeah yeah well that's maybe because your ears
A	it's really cos there's nothing
A	it's not dangling down or anything
C	yeah yeah
A	so too small
C	I mean I decided you know when I got my hair cut really short that
A	earrings are good idea
C	earrings would be a were were a good idea
A	yeah
C	you know seen from the back
A	yeah cos
C	that I am female
A	long hair it's all
C	yeah yeah
A	covered up anyway so
C	yes
A	just to make sure
C	called me you know come here old man you know and I turn round and
A	I don't think that would happen
D	chef needs some red wine actually
C	oh does he? yes
A	but
C	mm uhu uhu
A	and I thought what a good idea
C	yes
A	when you're at a party
C	very pretty it was too
A	but it's lovely and
C	yeah
A	it stops people getting embarrassed that they've forgotten your name
C	yeah yes yes cos there
A	so
C	there it was actually yeah
A	yeah
A	everyone should just wear a badge shouldn't they?
C	yes yes
A	yeah
A	mm
C	and er she was actually I mean she said to me oh that that'll go towards my rent and I said
A	that is that's
C	no way is that going towards your rent
A	ah
C	your mother's gonna pay for your rent
A	yeah
C	you know cos we give her an allowance
A	it just disappears then doesn't it? yeah
C	and and so
A	oh
C	to get it made so she was
A	was it? it's very nice
C	very pleased with that
A	yeah
C	oh that's another one isn't it?
D	well yeah it is

C	yeah
D	chilling
C	yeah what's the the wine that

A	yeah it's one of yours
C	it is it's one that you brought actually

C	I thought it tasted a bit like a I had a sip of it seemed a bit like a a Sauvignon Blanc
D	could be
C	could it? yeah
D	could be I'm I'm a bit when it comes to white wines I kind of stick to like a Muscadet or something

C	oh right yeah
D	I might have to pick some of that up
C	mm
D	oh

D	no one's bigger than the other
C	a little portion and a big portion
D	yeah
D	mm
C	yeah yeah cos the previous one was horrendous really

D	which is quite common on the first litter
C	is it?
D	and I tried her again and
C	mm
D	she won't take it so
C	oh that's interesting that they sort of have a litter and say I'm not having any of that
A	postnatal depression
C	do they eat them or strangle them or?
D	just suffocate them or
C	mm mm
D	so I think I'll
B	is that alright dear?
A	mm
D	I'll have to look for another female rabbit
C	mm
D	cos I know the male's good
C	that's actually a very tasty bit of lamb actually
A	it's lovely
C	yeah
D	it's very good
A	where did you get the lamb from?
C	that was from erm Aldi
B	Aldi
A	mm
D	right
C	I picked it up on on the way here cos you know I went down to that that store
A	yeah
C	actually to get wood
B	quite tasty aren't they?
C	yeah
D	mm
C	what's in them?
D	is there apple in it or something or?

B	mm er
D	oh yeah yeah of course you did
C	you didn't did you?
B	yes I did
A	yeah we put it back in the oven
C	mm
B	well weirdly it was the breast that was underdone and the legs and thighs were fine
C	right
B	just shows how odd our oven is
C	hopefully you like your lamb rare
D	yeah oh yeah
C	yeah
D	yeah I like my beef as well like that
C	yeah
B	is that what you're drinking?

B	oh good girl
A	is there any more lamb?
B	uhu
A	well if you don't want yours I'll have a bit of yours
B	uhu
A	mm good
C	something very attractive about having kale and carrots together because
D	mm
A	mm
C	and nothing the least bit insipid about them
B	yeah
C	uhu
D	there's erm
B	mm
A	yeah
C	uhu
A	yeah it really is
C	uhu
A	deep
D	mm
C	kale is
A	colour
C	particularly good for your eyes
D	mm
C	mm
B	there's also more gravy if you want
C	mm
B	some of that dear darling
A	I don't but
C	and your roast potatoes whenever you put them in and whatever you did with them and
A	shake them about
D	mm
B	which one did you use?
A	mm
D	well I thought I used the little one
B	is that the one nearest you?
C	no
A	no I'm confused
D	small against the wall that's what that's what I'm
C	mm
D	remembering
C	mm it's a circle
A	but that's got the bigger though
C	mm
A	I think
C	there's it is a circle divided into two by an arc
A	I think the one against the wall's the little one
C	yeah because the
A	and I think the one nearest is the big
C	the circle is like that and the the divider is like that
A	yeah yeah I know
B	uhu
C	so yeah so
C	is that
C	it raises it just that little bit cos certainly in the shop it seemed quite low
D	yeah
A	it was low yeah
D	and actually it doesn't seem so low
B	it's healthier to have a lower seat actually
[ANNOTATION]	It's good for your health to have a lower seat	Entailment

A	yeah
D	well his funeral I think was on Thursday or Wednesday and a lot of the cast know him so they wanted to go to the funeral see so

D	well you know and I mean they I was
A	it sounds like it's a bit beset with problems
D	at the moment yeah
C	mm
[ANNOTATION]	it doesn't sound like problem at all, acording to speaker a	Contradiction

A	and he was in a very good
C	I remember reading the news about him
A	a very good
C	he wasn't that old actually was he?
A	he was in a very good film
B	sixty-nine
C	oh he was as old as that?
A	a very good film set

C	yes
D	to be had so
C	yes
C	mm
B	yeah and anyone else will except for you
B	you didn't have your soup
D	mm
A	I wouldn't have my mains if I'd had soup
C	would your tendency be well particularly with sitting here would your thinking be to keep the kitchen there keep it as it is?
D	don't know I think it's you have to live in the space I mean I
C	yeah yeah you are er erm
A	what do you mean giving more use?
C	well it looked very small with little workspace but it it works very well
A	yeah but if you keep it minimalist it's
C	yes yes
A	absolutely fine
C	yeah
A	but you have to be ruthless
C	yeah yeah
A	so and I've been ruthless some things have had to go
C	yeah yeah
A	so
C	yeah mm
A	and all the work surfaces need to be kept clear
C	yes
B	and
C	mind you I think that of any kitchen
A	stop being sarcastic
D	you have no chance in mine at the moment
C	really?
D	I've er I've had a temporary kitchen for the last twelve years
C	oh really?
D	and
C	now why's it temporary?
D	cos
C	you were planning to move somewhere else or
D	yes
C	yeah
D	now that was the plan but when you've lived with it I actually quite like the room that the kitchen's in so we're gonna keep the kitchen where it is but just knock a big hole through the wall to it brings it into the sitting room
C	right yes yes
D	so
C	yeah but as you say it's only after you've lived there for a for somehow that you can
D	mm
C	get the feel of the place
D	but er my my work my worktops are
C	pardon?
D	my worktops are full
D	you know it's just I mean it
C	yeah
D	you know I have certain spaces with various chopping boards that are clear

C	oh right oh right yes yeah
D	don't we don't have any sort of we have a cupboard to keep the food tinned foods and dried foods in but

D	no well no I I I I tend like at home the kitchen table I
A	mm
D	and I just put it on the everything from my pocket I just
A	uhu
D	and it drives
A	oh so
D	cos she likes to clear the table and
[ANNOTATION]	Person D could not find something that put on the table before	Entailment
A	yes
D	and I go er
A	that's like
D	where is everything?
A	comes in dumps a load of things
D	yeah but I don't dump it
D	all over the place that's the thing
A	no
[ANNOTATION]	Person A trying to persuade Person D that it is her fault	Neutral
D	I have a corner
A	it's in control
D	and I go
A	yeah
D	oh there it is cos I know where it is then and and
A	it's your little corner
D	you know I'm terrible
A	I think there there's a compromise cos you could have a special box or something
D	true
A	that's neat enough for
D	yeah well yeah
A	that sort of thing
D	that's true
B	could you shut the door? I know you like to leave it open dear but it's nice without breeze here
A	uhu
B	that's sarcasm again
A	no that was just not sarcasm that was just I don't think it was sarcasm
[ANNOTATION]	Person A is not sure about person b's words were sarcasm	Entailment
B	bit sarcastic
A	oh was it? okay
B	cos I made pretend that you meant to leave it open but of course you just don't
[ANNOTATION]	Person B want to go to the pool	Contradiction
A	what the hell were those?
A	oh
C	sorry
C	oh oh the wrong one
B	I have to
A	this time
[ANNOTATION]	Person A want to do painting	Contradiction
B	I did the back flush
A	the one at the the back I'm sorry I'm not getting this
B	well here's the mnemonic
A	the one next to the wall
C	is the same
A	is for wees
B	but the way to remember it is the rhyme the one near the wall
A	is for wee
B	is for small
A	oh the one near the wall is for small
C	and
C	by the one near the wall it's just it's the same depression but
A	but that looks like the bigger one cos that's the one that's sticking out in a concave fashion not convex
C	no the the
A	the one next to the wall is going
C	no no
A	no it is
C	no it isn't
A	no hold on let me look again
C	no
C	wait a minute stay up there
D	the one near the wall is small
A	look it's
C	yeah but if you think of that as
A	no that's bigger
C	no no if you think of
D	I didn't mean to install it to cause
D	a family rift
D	I'll take the flush away and you'll have to do a bucket
C	so all of this
A	yeah well to me that
C	no but think of the diameter
A	no okay
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	so so it's the top one
A	yeah
C	and actually it looks smaller
A	alright well that's my strange
C	yeah
A	autistic brain
C	yeah
A	then
C	well
A	but it's to me that looks like the bigger one
C	if you look at it yeah but
C	can you see? can you see that it's
A	er there's more space
C	yeah
A	in here yeah
C	yeah it's very very solid
A	oh it's lovely
C	yeah
C	so this little one is the half flush
A	that's the small one I'd still like an arrow
C	and this
A	well
C	well I think
A	they'll just flush whichever and what happens if you flush both of them at the same time?
C	well I don't think it matters
B	a super flush
A	is that a super flush?
B	yeah
C	oh is it?
A	I don't know there must be some instructions somewhere
C	no I think you're just meant to work it out
A	it doesn't say
B	mm
A	he's gonna be
B	try and do some of it yeah
C	can you hear that wind?

C	mm mm
D	erm the whole
C	and the piers even the mm mm
D	yeah yeah but also erm seeing London from a different angle
C	mm
D	it it was like being subterranean it was it was just so
C	a real sort of Victorian sense
D	looking up it was lovely it was really good really good and
A	get another one
D	er no I'm I'm I'm
C	yeah I mean
D	I mean he's well into it
C	I know when when you when you go down
C	on the Thames boat the the
B	that's a good idea
C	erm
D	mm
C	edge in
D	mm
C	these huge great skyscrapers
D	yeah
C	and
B	yeah I can name them
D	yeah
C	mm
B	Sir John Gielgud owns one of them called The Grape or the The Grapes

C	Ian McKellen
B	it could be Ian McKellen
C	mm
B	or are we just gonna name gay actors? but it's it's one that's
C	I think it is Ian McKellen actually
B	right on the waterfront
C	I think I I seem to know that
D	is that Gandalf? does Ian McKellen
A	er
D	play Gandalf?
D	in Lord of the Rings?
B	yes
D	so
C	mm I
D	right
B	that was probably also the last time you saw him darling
C	oh no no no cos he's one of my favourite actors actually
B	well name something else
C	erm well over the
B	that we might see him in
A	stop being so
C	oh no
B	sorry
C	well let me finish my story anyway
B	she's not finished
C	but he was this was at the Edinburgh Festival at the Assembly Rooms which
B	yeah
C	of course is a a you know a sort of
D	right
C	I mean unbelievable actually I mean it was unbelievable as a simple memory exercise you know
A	mm
C	halfway through Edward the second you sort of suddenly threw yourself into a Richard speech but erm absolutely superb
D	mm
C	and a
B	I've never seen him on the stage
A	I get confused
C	mm
A	being Ian McKellen and the other one
A	no there's another
B	yeah they were in a terrible terrible sitcom together
A	no but that was Ian McKellen
B	not so long ago
A	wasn't it? or is that the other one that I'm thinking of?
B	they were both in it
A	no
B	oh sorry
C	yeah who is the other one yeah?
B	you're right I'm thinking of McKellen again aren't I?
A	mm
B	oh I can't remember I'm useless
D	oh
B	at names so
D	yeah
B	there's no point
D	so I can
A	mm
D	but he's not in the last Star Wars film cos he's got killed killed off in
B	okay
D	the previous one but he played the emperor
B	have you seen have you seen the new one
D	yes
B	did you take the lad to it?
D	no no he'd
B	oh
D	he'd er
B	in France?
D	yeah yeah we went to see a

D	er yeah yeah yeah it was in English they had it had erm French subtitles on it but erm yeah we went to
B	the Bond
D	the Bond yeah which I'd like to but I'll
C	yeah
D	watch it at home so
B	thing is the turnaround these days
D	I know
B	I mean growing up you used to have to wait sort of like five six seven years
D	yeah
B	before you could see a film
D	well
B	if you'd missed it and you get it on video
D	that's right cos it's
B	now it's like
D	no
B	within twelve months you can
D	yeah well
B	that's very well reviewed
D	erm yeah erm and there was a
C	oh right yeah
B	it stings
A	why?
A	cos it's you can't
D	what do you call them? er where they all get together and then see each other for at least ten minutes
C	oh
D	yeah yeah
C	at least oh yes yeah
D	and they there must have been
C	to be to be avoided
D	there was probably probably only about thirty people in there and they're all Brits you know
C	yeah yeah
D	but it was
C	yeah
D	well you know first time I went to the cinema it was a lovely little cinema actually and it was really cheap and
C	yeah
D	but the film the film was very good
B	mm
D	yeah I must admit yeah no I I'd recommend it
B	oh it's got er Mark Rylance
D	yeah yeah yeah
B	in it
D	yeah
B	hasn't it?
D	no
B	I think he's up for an Oscar Mark he is up for an Oscar
D	for that?
B	yep
D	I
B	best supporting actor
D	well I I I hope he gets it actually
B	mm
D	cos erm he does
B	he doesn't do a lot of film roles for some reason does he?
D	very good well he is a very particular to theatre actor
B	yeah
A	mm
C	really? oh
D	used to be erm the artistic director at The Almeida see so
A	mm
D	we used to have the emperor of the universe was running
D	the Almeida theatre
C	so

A	okay
D	you would know he he plays the emperor
A	I have not seen the Star Wars films but if he's been in Morse I will have seen him
D	yeah he would have yeah he played he played

B	I do not recognise well you wouldn't recognise him in Star Wars cos
A	I want to see
C	if that makes your skin itch stop doing it
B	yeah
A	yes it would make sense to take that action
B	I can give it to
A	that non-action
B	if he grows a beard
[ANNOTATION]	That he doesn't currently have a beard.	Entailment
D	oh I like mine just as a stubble
D	you haven't noticed I've had my hair cut since I've been here

D	so do I I go and see my little
C	mm
B	in Islington?

D	yeah no no no here
C	oh here yeah
[ANNOTATION]	That there are no nearby barbers.	Neutral
D	yeah there's a little barber shop
C	yeah
D	that
B	I would have done it for you
[ANNOTATION]	That the other person is accomadating.	Entailment
D	I'm sure you would
B	gratis
D	yeah
A	I've a delightful little hairdresser's up the road it's just
D	yeah
A	your bog standard hairdresser's it's not pretentious
C	and what does she charge for a cut?
A	erm seventeen pounds
C	yeah
D	yeah see I mine's eight
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	That the barber has high prices.	Neutral
D	eight pound and I I always pay a tenner for it
A	well she does my fringe
B	yeah but
A	yeah it would be eighty
B	and be in there for like most of the day
D	yeah yeah yeah
A	and it's like
D	yeah
A	absolutely not very good
[ANNOTATION]	That cutting hair takes a long time.	Entailment
D	yeah
A	either
B	and if you
D	yeah
A	so
B	factor in travel
[ANNOTATION]	That it's something easy to do.	Neutral
A	and just because it's some trendy place in London
D	exactly well this is
A	and and you get the same result
D	this is right opposite
B	Boots
D	well no by yeah by Boots you know it's just round the corner in a up a little street but
C	yeah right
D	that's it
C	yeah
D	and I go in and go er where's where's the girl with the glasses?
B	mm
D	oh she's downstairs well I'll wait for her then
C	oh really? you always
D	and I just
C	yeah
D	and I go in and then we start chatting and oh I remember now you know
C	yes yeah
D	but she's lovely yeah I mean nothing you know but she just does
C	yeah
D	a really nice cut and I'm
C	yeah
D	happy and
C	and she's nice nice
D	she trims my eyebrows and
D	all that sort of thing
A	mm
D	and she's lovely
C	yeah gosh yeah
B	I had a
D	yeah
B	or exorbitantly priced and just thought I can just do better like I had one haircut
D	yeah
B	the chap just spent all the time talking to me
D	mm
B	and seeming not to be paying much attention and when I got home I had to go over my hair with my
D	yeah that's
B	trimmers and I thought well hang on why have I just spent twenty quid?
D	exactly
C	yeah
A	yeah
D	I I think you know a tenner is is
B	but if you're getting a good cut
D	perfect you know
B	then I don't mind paying
D	good cut
B	but if it's something you can just do
C	yeah
A	yeah
B	yourself in ten minutes
D	mm
B	for nothing then then I'm not gonna do that
A	well my hairdresser's is a kind of slightly chavvy hairdresser's where they do nails as well so it's all these
D	oh yeah
A	great big bright coloured nails
C	yeah
A	really awful ones and everything
C	mm
A	so someone's there having their nails done and then
D	mm
A	these great big
A	big
D	well we we do have a we have a a hairdresser in France an English lady who's self-employed and you know we
C	yeah
D	they they're always saying can we go and see
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker's D hairdresser is in France.	Entailment
C	really? yeah
D	you know and every
A	really?
D	month or something
C	yeah yeah
D	you know she's like
C	yeah
D	because they want to have the you know
C	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	The hairdresser speaks French very well.	Neutral
D	and she does hair dyes and in fact
C	yeah
D	sorted whatever she's doing
C	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	The hairdresser can do any kind of hair dye.	Neutral
D	tints or
C	yeah
D	cuts or
A	dyed
C	yes
D	you know
A	but the thing is a hairdresser is a hairdresser is a hairdresser and they all know how to cut hair
D	no
A	and they're all trained to sort of you know
D	no
A	do whatever
D	no you get you get
C	but I think
[ANNOTATION]	Two years of classes and training is needed for one to become a hairdresser.	Neutral
A	that thing so
D	but but you get good you get good hairdressers and you get bad hairdressers you know
A	well it depends on their personality
C	well and I but I think
D	no no
[ANNOTATION]	According to A, being a good or bad hairdresser depends on the personality.	Entailment
A	they're all trained
D	no they may be all trained but they need to understand what you want
C	want
A	yeah true
C	and and what your hair does
[ANNOTATION]	Training is enough for a hairdresser to be good.	Contradiction
A	yeah
C	yes the the quirky way
A	yeah
C	bits grow
A	and it's very erm
C	cos I've had the same hairdresser
A	random really
C	for years now
A	it's terrible because
C	at thirty-five pounds a shot
A	I usually
D	right
C	yeah
A	find someone and then they move to Italy or something
D	yeah no well that's it
A	it's really annoying
D	that's why I'm always surprised when I I always poke my nose in if I'm
A	yeah
D	where's the girl with the glasses? and
C	yeah
D	if she's there I go oh perfect
C	yeah yeah
A	yeah
D	can you cut my hair? but
C	yeah
D	any of the others cos I have tried one of the others and
A	yeah they just
D	but it wasn't so good
A	don't understand
C	no no
D	no wasn't
A	there was only
D	just wasn't good
A	ever one hairdresser that understood how to do the back of my neck when I had a bob and when he left no one could do the back of my neck
C	yeah
A	and it always looked awful that's why I've got long hair now really but erm the only who knew
D	mm
C	yeah
A	knew how to do a smooth look without the sort of duck's bottom effect
C	yeah
A	cos I've got thick hair so
C	yeah
A	no sadly he left
D	yeah
C	yes and
A	but I think you're safer when you've got longer hair though cos nothing can go that wrong when you've got long hair anyway
D	well
A	and you just have a trim
D	unless they cut it badly and you think oh I'm gonna have to have it all cut off
C	well no
A	but that can't really happen when it's long anyway cos
D	well well no well it can
C	well at least if it's long you've got a you can make it a if it goes wrong you can have it cut a little bit shorter
D	mm
C	to correct it whereas
D	mm
C	if it's short and it goes wrong there's
A	yeah that's the most disastrous
C	not much leeway
D	it's funny cos
A	the short awful cut
D	there's a
A	is the worst one
C	yeah
D	you know we've got two hairdressers in our local village right okay you know the one is the blue rinse brigade she's
C	oh right yeah
D	the the it's that's where all
C	and stiff
D	all
C	stiff curls
D	and then have that
B	the
D	dye
A	is that still going the blue rinse?
D	oh god yeah in
A	how funny I didn't know that was
D	thirty years behind
C	yeah
D	but
A	blue rinse is a
D	and then there's another one that is like aimed at the younger or I
D	dunno where fashion's going really but
C	it it was one of these with a half
B	was it asymmetrical?
C	half a side
A	is it
D	oh it was
A	was it a Phil Oakey? you know
D	oh
A	Human League
D	kind of yeah
A	asymmetric
C	what did
D	well he goes oh this is what the fashion is now
D	I just went
C	yeah
D	awful you know and I
C	yeah
C	yeah
D	whereas the Frenchman says you know you say oh I'd like this and this they go okay yeah okay
C	yeah
D	and they go che-che
A	yeah exactly
D	there you go that's what you want
C	yeah
D	er no
C	and it's a bit late to say well no it wasn't what I asked for
D	that's not that's not
A	but it's like when you
D	what I asked for
A	when you say
D	and it's not an angry statement
C	no
D	at all
A	no no it's funny because you can say I want it really flat flat flat so what about flat don't you understand? because you'll come out with big hair
D	yeah I know I know
C	yeah
A	you know
C	big hair
A	I think they just start enjoying themselves really with the hairdryer
D	exactly their
A	and start oh this is fun
D	as like a oh oh I need a practice
C	yeah
A	yeah
D	you know I'll have a you know I'll
A	you're a piece of art
D	have a play around
A	you're an object
C	I mean it's incredibly personal
D	yeah
C	you know your hair is
D	yeah
A	I know
C	you know exactly when it is right and
A	but that's why I
C	you know exactly when it's wrong
D	yeah
A	I do hate hairdressers though because I don't hate them but to them they're just it's just a job
C	yeah
A	but to you it's
D	no but but yeah yeah
A	deeply personal
D	well exactly
C	yeah
A	there's that
D	yeah but it's also like you know it's like going to the dentist isn't it? you know
A	yeah
D	and it's just a job to a dentist
A	yeah it's just doing a mechanical thing
D	but you've gotta be comfortable with
C	yeah
D	what they've done haven't you you know?
A	you're a person
D	you know?
A	there is a person in here mm but they do just see hair I suppose
D	mm
A	they see hair but dunno
D	mm
A	weird
C	no yes yes

D	yeah
C	well
D	but it's over a metre
C	it it's no it's actually it's that length less the door

D	about a metre and a metre and a
B	that's
D	you can use the rest for kindling purposes

B	that's all I'd buy one single length and it's all
D	mm
B	pre measured lengths but that's all I would need
D	mm
C	but why didn't you get one today? you just couldn't

C	yeah
D	I
C	he had what?
B	I quite like
D	shutters
C	oh right yeah
D	yeah
B	I quite like shutters
D	Venetian er not Venetian erm what were they?
B	like fold-out?
D	yeah no they it's er
B	horizontal well I mean laterally?
D	they they're all they're hinged
C	right and and
D	so you can have a
C	rest where?
D	against against
C	the wall?
D	the wall
C	yeah
D	erm but they're also louvred
C	oh right yeah
D	so you can
C	yeah
D	but they've got
C	ah right yes yeah cos
D	but they're split as well so the top you can
C	yeah you can have the top
D	yeah
C	the lower bit yeah
D	but er I mean I'm they weren't cheap
C	no
D	I can't remember how much they were but I I I was quite shocked but they are very well made
C	yeah
D	and they're like they've got this they're wood but they almost look like plastic with the type of paint finish they've got on them
C	yeah
B	just pre pre
D	it's yeah it's all
B	painted
D	pre pre-done
C	yeah
D	so all all the guy came in for the morning and just put them up
C	yeah yeah
D	all done and he measured them all up and all that
C	yeah
D	but they're lovely
D	mm
C	they'd be quite good for privacy there actually yeah
B	privacy
D	mm
B	until the
D	I think
B	the privet hedge grows
D	certainly erm you notice a difference with the heat
B	well otherwise I'd just like these windows replaced but with real windows
D	yeah yeah
B	like for like
A	hello
B	ah look at him looking up
D	proper sort of double glazed
C	yeah double glazed
B	wouldn't even necessarily have to be double glazed I mean I I thought
C	oh they would have to be double glazed
D	you should yeah no
B	well just
C	for oh for heat conservation
B	just the sash window
D	well you can get
B	oh no
B	yeah I had
B	someone here to give me a quote
D	yeah in wood?
B	yeah
D	mm
C	and what was for the snug that was and how much was it for the snug?
B	I can't remember now it's about three or four hundred pounds per window
D	mm
B	they don't the size doesn't matter
C	mind you if it was only three or four hundred that's not bad actually for a whole window
D	mm
C	they're very big windows
D	mm
C	yeah
D	you know
B	oh he's got salt on his nose
C	yeah
A	ah
C	yes yes
A	you won't like that
C	that's we're lucky down in you know
D	mm
A	mm
A	yeah bit raw
C	you know the people that we've used you know we know and they live there
D	mm
C	so you know they can't get away with a real sort of rogue job at all
D	mm
C	you know so
D	mm
C	and most of them work by word of mouth and reputation so
D	exactly yeah
C	so you know their their reputation is is er
D	mm
C	er very valuable for them so they don't want to do badly
B	must get window cleaners as well on the basis that we've never had
A	mm so do
B	they won't reach the top but they could at least do the
A	well I think they would they're window cleaners
B	no I've asked before and they can't reach the top
C	I mean they'd be
D	er what
C	pretty lucky
A	oh
C	to be able to get up to here
D	no?
B	they can get up to here I reckon without any issue
D	well you've been do do they open upstairs?
B	it's a little difficult
B	it's not necessarily the case that erm they open fully both ways so
A	mm
B	you know cos I've tried doing it on the inside
D	mm
B	and then it almost looks worse if there's a little stretch you can't get so you've got clean and then a revolting stripe
D	right
C	yes yeah then you're really aware of it
B	then you're suddenly
C	yes yeah
B	that they are
C	yeah whereas if they're just dirty
B	truly if they're just dirty
C	you actually in a way don't notice like
D	mm
C	glasses actually
D	mm
B	yeah
C	yeah
D	I think you
C	yeah
D	just cos of the dogs
C	ah
D	cos the dogs are outside and they stick their noses up
C	oh
D	against the window or their paw
C	so there's all
D	and you know
B	is that one of
D	er yeah yeah occasionally we say oh yeah when you're it's on your list give the windows a good clean
