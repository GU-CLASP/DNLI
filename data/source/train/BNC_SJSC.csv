A	well what did she get done for? I think that's a real double standard I don't think that's fair
B	having sex with a minor but she didn't get put on the sex offenders register
A	but how is that any different from a man having sex with an eleven year old girl?
B	dunno
A	like I think that's just a
B	it's cos the boy went the boy led her on
A	so but how do you prove that a girl doesn't lead a boy on?
B	you don't
