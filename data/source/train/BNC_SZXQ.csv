B	if you like
A	not fussed? We will see how it goes
B	ah so revealing my deepest darkest secrets
B	would be um a gamble
B	hm
A	I've been watching too much Friends
B	yeah
A	between Friends and Magnum
B	that's probably not much healthier
B	yes
A	well
B	of course
A	er of course
B	of course
A	well he actually fell in love with her rather than just being like hm she's quite hot
A	um it's kind of
B	are they identical twins?
A	they're identical twins
B	oh dear
A	um
B	wow
A	yeah
B	normally it's just driving around in a fancy car
A	mm
B	joking about Higgins' Britishness
A	exactly
B	hm
A	still haven't watched that
B	mm
A	is it out on DVD?
B	I'm sure it is
B	mm
A	not just you
B	mm
A	half an hour everything happens type thing
B	yeah
A	mm
B	everything happens
A	like Brideshead
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	and then about ten minutes before the end of the final episode of the second series you think oh
A	yeah
B	they're not gonna be making any more series
A	Cos it's gotta end
B	but no
A	mm
B	actually there might be more series
A	oh
B	but um yeah
A	mm
B	yeah
A	er it's it's it's always good if it's actually had an effect on you rather than being like oh it's okay
B	mm
A	which is a tendency with a lot of
B	well
A	well
B	you can
B	ever think about it ever again but
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	have you seen Let Me In?
B	and it's called Let Me In?
A	um um yes it's it's a it's an American remake on Let Me In it's an American remake of the Swedish film which has the title um Let The Right One In
B	oh right
A	which is
B	mm
A	the basic premise being that a vampire can't enter your house unless you invite them in
B	which I know because I watched one episode of Being Human ever
A	I haven't seen that
A	bBC3 isn't it? Yeah
B	it wasn't bad with one er from that one episode
A	mm
B	but er I'm not gonna get into it
B	anyway
A	mm
B	hm
A	no it's
B	another one
A	I won't spoil it
B	right
A	it's a
B	film
A	film rather than
B	film
A	yeah but it's um
B	okay
A	it's er apparently it's an almost if you er well I've we I've only seen the American one
B	oh that's good
A	so
B	american remakes
B	mm
A	slash Peter
B	oh yeah
A	english people won't either
B	there's no problem with subtitles
A	mm
B	I totally
A	I don't get the
B	I totally forgot that I was reading subtitles when I saw Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon
A	I think
B	you notice it for the first
A	yeah
B	thirty seconds
A	mm
B	you just take it in
A	yeah
B	as speech
A	exactly
B	mm
A	I think there's associations of work
B	depends how easily you can read
B	I suppose
A	yeah
A	if you're watching subtitles in a language other than your own then yes it's probably quite difficult
B	yeah
A	oo
B	it's sometimes helpful to have German subtitles
B	my my dad definitely finds it helpful having subtitles
A	oh
B	watching German films
A	right
B	Cos er
B	cos
A	mm
B	catch the words
A	it's easier to to read than er
B	than yeah
A	mm
B	you can see the separate words
A	yeah
B	mm
A	or
B	mm
A	is your dad like fluent in German then or? Er you know is it kind of
B	no
A	right
B	um
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	but he's never
A	yeah
B	Cos that requires a bit more
A	mm
B	be used to putting the words in the right order
B	understanding it
A	mm
B	doesn't require that
A	yeah
B	you know
A	mm
B	um doing German classes
A	oh that's really cool
A	yeah
B	so yeah
A	so they met in England then?
B	no
A	oh
B	they met in Scotland
A	right
A	um
B	they met on the Isle of Arran
A	very nice  very nice
B	um
A	mm
B	HF Holidays
A	mm
B	so
A	you did tell me that
B	I've told you about HF stands for husband found
B	apparent because it's happened so many times
A	that's really nice
B	and mm
A	well I guess it makes sense
B	yeah
A	you already have something you like
B	yeah
A	mm
B	so
A	that's interesting
A	I wonder what the correlation is
B	mm
A	I think I've had enough sandwich
B	mm
A	mm
A	yeah
A	mm
B	better than my afternoon snack
A	I am I'm  I'm
B	from the vending machine
A	mm I'm fond of a Twix at three o'clock
B	mhm
A	twix and coffee
B	hm
A	very good
B	what I should do more often is just um go up to the little kitchen area on the third floor where the vending machine is
A	mhm
B	sit down on the little mini sofa
A	mhm
B	just have a
A	have a coffee break
B	quarter of an hour
A	very good idea
B	the first  the first  floor kitchen is is not so great
A	mm
B	onto the  onto the  aisle
A	mhm
B	whereas the third floor kitchen is enclosed
A	yeah
B	and there's a
A	yeah
B	but er
A	well
B	mm
A	they have a half hour longer standard day which includes two fifteen minute breaks
B	yeah
A	hm
B	um
A	mm
A	nice
B	yeah
B	breaks because someone has to cover for her at the desk when she
A	right
B	goes up to have a coffee
B	or whatever
A	yeah
B	um
A	yeah
B	mm
A	on the er on the eyes
B	mm
A	mm
B	you can really
A	rowing hands
B	you can
A	yeah
B	due to rowing can't you?
A	you really can
B	yeah
A	I wonder how long it takes to disappear
B	probably not the most attractive
A	you look
B	well it takes a long time to disappear I think
A	yeah
A	mm
B	pretty much there
A	wow
A	you can pretend to be like a a labourer
B	mm
B	mm
A	watering something probably
A	or playing tea-shops
B	urgh
B	Don't drink that
B	mm
A	and um er you know like when they were finished there'd be a bit of tea left
B	yeah
A	and my sister would always just make like concoctions
B	mm
A	and then try and get a parent to drink it
B	sorry?
A	I'm quite excited for her coming
B	huh
A	huh
B	got a text from
A	oh yeah
B	is she?
A	mm
B	is he?
A	he's he is
A	I think the
B	ah
A	um
A	why?
B	hm?
A	why?
B	why? Er
B	no
A	she's very hard to pin down
B	yes
A	is she er she's er is she alright in the text?
B	er
A	she sort of hinted saying I
B	yeah
A	mm
B	just this bright outside
A	what? From Skyping?
B	no
A	huh? Where are you pointing?
B	look
A	oh
B	that
A	oh a photo on his desk?
B	someone who must must be his daughter on his desk who's got
A	oh
B	which prompted me to text her
B	that's about it
A	and it sorry I didn't read her reply
B	oh
A	I
B	oh
A	hm
B	right
B	mm
A	I love the little Android
B	ta
A	android smilies
B	yeah
A	nice
B	so
A	that's good
B	um
A	well
B	she's alive
A	positive noises anyway
B	that's good
A	mm
B	mm
A	it's a bit awkward
[ANNOTATION]	The woman they speak of is well	Entailment
B	no
A	sort of not
B	yeah
A	mm
B	chatted chatted
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	The woman is Speaker B's mother	Neutral
B	um she said something about
B	I dunno
A	mm
B	I dunno if this is er it's at all related to what she might've been hinting at to you
A	mm
B	I dunno
A	yeah
B	well
A	I dunno
B	mm
A	I hope she's talked to somebody about it anyway
B	whatever it is
A	yeah
B	maybe
[ANNOTATION]	The woman has not spoken to neither Speaker A nor Speaker B	Entailment
B	yeah
A	he was er he was
B	mm
[ANNOTATION]	The woman has been fighting with her boyfriend	Neutral
A	mm
B	where was it in Scotland that he was on about?
A	um
B	where where what what was the name of the place he was on about?
A	lochside Cottages
B	it was a name beginning with a T
A	oh
A	that's the one
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B can't remember the place he was talking about	Entailment
B	oh that's a
A	yeah
B	oh I was just thinking cos er the place my brother's going
A	mm
B	it's it's Torridon
A	mm
B	in
A	in Scotland is it?
B	Scotland
A	right
B	it's um pretty much directly west of Inverness
A	mm
B	so is? I get the impression
A	um
[ANNOTATION]	B's brother is going to a place east of Inverness.	Contradiction
B	okay
A	not particularly
B	just the ones that I've seen
[ANNOTATION]	B's brother is not going to a place located in Scotland.	Contradiction
A	I think well the ones in Scotland where we've been before which are really nice
B	mm
A	um
B	where in Wales then?
A	sort of mid-Wales
A	um it's kind of exactly half-way up the the coast
B	right
A	mm
B	that sounds flat
A	um
B	then again it's coast
A	I was gonna say there's there's lots of beaches
B	ah cliffs cliffs
A	and yes er there's er um
B	there need to be cliffs
[ANNOTATION]	There is no need to see cliffs when visiting an area.	Contradiction
B	little what?
A	ponies
B	mm
A	so like little Shetland horses
B	how little?
B	near er
B	where we  where we  did all the er walk on the first day in tut in er Glencoe um yeah we came across a field that had two horses in it
A	right
B	one which was a small horse
[ANNOTATION]	B saw two horses in a Glencoe field, one of which was a small horse.	Entailment
A	aw
B	it was like this big
A	I love tiny horses
[ANNOTATION]	The small horse B saw was a Shetland horse.	Neutral
A	they weren't that small but they're so cute
B	yeah
A	aw
B	it was amazing
A	aw
B	I think it must have been a young one
[ANNOTATION]	Two people enjoy seeing small horses.	Entailment
A	mm
B	it but it it was er
A	like a baby Shetland or something?
B	it wasn't
A	or smaller?
B	yeah I mean it wasn't like it was extremely young
A	mhm
B	it was just probably quite young
A	mm
B	I don't think they'd let you
A	not if I was like heavier than it
A	bit harsh
B	A noble steed
B	oh God
A	in er Shrek
B	yeah
B	no
A	just so good
B	oh you've not got er sensible internet
A	yeah
B	still?
A	no word
B	I
A	sort of nearly finished the road though
B	I wanna stay here
A	yeah
B	got sunstroke
B	mm
A	mm
B	I really wanna during the summer have some way in which I can just come to the garden and work
A	you did discuss it as part of the employment well-being scheme
B	yeah
A	so it should be outdoors
B	I mean even in the blazing sun it will probably be cooler here than in my office
B	Cos it's horrible
A	you see mine's er really cold
B	there's no air conditioning
A	oo
B	which I'd be fine with I mean um I'm not pro air conditioning
B	you've got a building that won't heat up like a greenhouse
A	ah
B	mm
A	can't be doing with this
B	sweat patches
B	yeah I know
A	hm
B	no I didn't actually
A	oh that's alright then
A	I wasn't terribly concerned
B	mm
A	actually though we are moving across the road um like next month
B	oh right
A	um which I'm not massively excited about
B	oh that's nice
A	it's gonna be tulips
B	yeah
A	attached to where I sit
B	I'm fairly attached to where I sit
A	nice
B	um
A	yeah
B	I mean I can look out of a window
A	mm
B	my desk
A	yeah
B	ah
A	also known as by the window
B	mm
A	so I'm kind of got my fingers crossed for that
A	ah
B	I should've worn a black shirt
A	A what shirt?
B	I should've worn a black shirt
B	my legs are heating up more than my body
A	uh
B	hm
A	quite loud
B	er authoritative
A	yeah
B	murmurings
A	oh you did tell me this
B	in like several years
A	er leaving the outside up but stripping it
B	well not necessarily even the outside
A	or completely
B	they're just leaving the structural elements
A	oh okay
B	or whatever
A	right
B	um
A	yeah
B	which means a
A	if er yeah
B	but
A	if it's wider and shorter then yeah
B	the idea would be to basically make it all new energy-efficient et cetera  et cetera
A	yeah
B	and it would be they'd add a floor on the top
A	right
B	basically
A	right
B	um
A	with just
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	um
A	yeah
B	and you could get all of Mott's staff into that one building rather than split across three buildings
A	oh okay
B	um
A	what just like are they further down the road or something do you mean or?
B	well there's we've got one floor in twenty Station Road
B	and we've got er it's not quite so comparable but
A	yes
B	you know where the steps up
A	yes
B	next to the roundabout?
A	yeah
B	er we've er got all of that
A	oh
B	with the er buildings and infrastructure and health and education units
A	aha
B	um
A	isn't
B	not
A	is it not?
B	it's
A	oh right
B	which is the education division of
B	so
B	but it's been er it it's now part of
A	right
B	um
A	so it's probably connected to
B	I'm not sure
B	I might have to
A	I can't remember
B	wikipedia it
A	yeah
B	or something
A	there might be no connection at all
B	mm
A	I suppose
B	but yeah
A	mm
B	will get around to implementing that plan
A	where will you all go?
B	I don't know
A	Cos that's the  that's the  kind of
B	temporary locations
A	yeah
B	they'll like probably have to cram more of us into
A	yeah
B	space
B	um
A	mm
B	find somewhere temporary
A	yeah
B	work from home?
A	I was just about to say yeah
B	mm
A	that'd be good
B	um
B	and for that long might present some problems
A	mm
B	dunno
A	yeah
B	mm
A	or you could have er
B	but er
A	you could have er sort of um like
B	yeah
A	which I think is maybe the easiest way
B	yeah
A	hm
B	and then it'll probably er take about a year for them to do it
A	yeah
B	and we'd have a brand new fancy building
A	yeah
B	even though that rent would be then higher because it's higher value
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	if it's er you know all jazzy and shiny and new would
B	yeah
A	presumably it's gonna save money in the long run
B	yeah
B	fixed the windows
B	and that kind of thing
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	stop throwing money away
B	because this might be on the horizon that they're not prioritizing small
A	yeah
B	like replacing carpet tiles
B	or
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	and twenty-five
B	yeah
A	it got manky
B	but
A	yeah
B	have you seen it?
A	I've been in  I've been in  one of them
B	yeah
A	oh they er both are yeah
