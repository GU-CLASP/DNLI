A	so that race was supposed to have more horses they've just been?
B	been pulled out cos of the weather
A	ah
B	nothing
A	they'll pull horses out even if the race is still running?
B	no it was before
A	yeah but I mean
B	an hour before they can say no it's too soft
A	like they don't like the
B	yeah
A	ah
B	so instead of having eleven horses then I'd've got a good place
A	see I just thought it if was like
B	no
A	race was going I assumed
B	no
A	that you could
B	no the trainer can pull them out with that in within an hour of the it going off
A	oh
B	there's seven runners I want them two out
A	and lose yeah?
B	oh you've fucking had it
A	what if you're betting on a non-runner you just don't make a bet
B	get oh you get your money
A	for that individual one?
B	yeah for that one horse
A	it really stitches people up though doesn't it?
B	yeah
A	I bet people have lost good money through that
B	yeah
A	probably fixed though isn't it? is it fixed?
A	no
A	we should have a day up the tracks again this year
B	yeah
A	is there?
B	yeah
A	let's go to
B	ain't this week but you
A	to have a day at the
B	yeah

A	yeah yeah
B	yeah
A	won over twenty and went over a hundred and twenty that day
B	erm
A	didn't bother working
B	I can't think how much that was
A	yeah
B	I mean
A	it is a rip-off
B	totally
A	it's a complete rip-off
B	yeah
A	yuppie types yuppies
B	and all the old all the old junk shops you go in
A	no
B	they didn't buy it they fucking put it down
A	people there are really
B	no
A	well it's a good university and it's a good location to do
B	it's
A	no and it's at least it's a nice like should be nice
B	you walk from here to fucking
A	yeah
B	big main road
A	yeah
B	you forget the parking
A	there shouldn't be too many chavy people around should there?
B	no
A	too expensive
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	cos I don't think that one you went to that day on the seafront was a good idea
A	eighteen quid for three and a half hours
B	no if we'd've gone up a bit further
A	yeah
B	about four empty
A	well you might've still had to pay for them but it wouldn't've been expensive
B	no
A	I'll have to look that up actually
B	well exactly if you're
A	do disabled badges
B	yeah
A	are there free passes
B	I'm sure it's free parking
A	no
B	no
A	if it's in the town you might be alright
B	it's up towards the town a bit
A	I don't really know
B	you
A	I've got three weeks until I've got
B	I mean that
A	why cos it one way?
A	turnings

B	yeah
A	er
B	yeah
A	mm
B	she's hooked on that
A	I don't know why cos she never does anything on it
B	no no
A	she just noses on what other people are doing
B	she just noses on what's going on
A	I do see on her on it she's like a teenager
A	just ask to use her phone to look at Facebook
B	yeah
A	she gets her notification
B	that what they're called?
A	yeah you get a notification
A	something happens
B	drives me crazy
A	thought she might've called today actually

A	well I might do in a little while
B	fifteen twenty-nine
A	half past three?
B	nearly half past three dunno if that's right
A	mm
B	cos sometimes it's quick it's funny that one
A	it's more or less right

B	yeah
A	got butter in
B	he I bet he won't eat his chicken
A	what
B	yeah he's a git for leaving it
A	oh why does he leave the chicken?
B	dunno
A	raw food?
B	he not
A	could eat it a bit of the chicken nugget
B	if you say to him if you don't eat that chicken you're not going like I do
A	mm
B	and then you go to town on it
A	mm
B	and if you leave him here he'll do his phone
A	he yeah he's distracted
B	I done a spicy shepherd's pie once and
A	put er turmeric and chilli in it last time
B	yeah loved it
A	mm
B	even
A	mm
B	he sat here
A	distracted the whole time
B	and and just
A	no
B	but I do cos he eats all his grub
A	well
B	yeah well he he eats it better
A	I dunno why
B	because it makes him laugh and it's
A	I don't see how they're just talking about a poxy computer game
B	see now there's only five runners
A	five another one's gone
B	out out of six of them so now that's crapped it right up
A	what time's that race?

A	they've got time to do stuff there
B	yeah
A	so is it the trainers that decide to pull out the horses?
B	yeah
A	oh does it?
B	two hundred and thirty people's had a bet on it
A	mm
B	which in my case will be worth doing
A	two hundred and thirty people isn't that many for
A	to be betting on on a race?
B	probably had a lot of people abandon it I mean weather's
A	yes the weather's bad
B	who's gonna stand at the race course when it's like this?
A	yeah no one
B	well it's all done it's all pre-planned innit?
A	mm
B	I mean if it didn't the race courses would shut down around the country and there'd be a lot of people out of work
A	mm
B	although when the when the horses go over the jumps and they land
A	mm
B	they're all
A	mm
B	yeah
A	it's because people like
B	yeah
A	probably pay them less than minimum wage to do that job
B	yeah

B	I mean
A	first generation to really eat processed food every day
B	yeah
A	woman to drink and smoke all the time
B	when in the sixties and fifties and forties it
A	yeah
B	now it's all chemicals processed
A	oh yeah
B	it's
A	no
B	they're frozen on the way over
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	the processed food are not good for health ,especially for women	Entailment
B	whatever and then kept in
A	everything's imported
B	yeah yeah
B	is when I go out to the farm and buy them off the farm
A	oh yeah
B	I do do
A	isn't anything
B	still got the dirt on them
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Sometimes they got the things from farm	Entailment
B	mum mum moans about the dirt but they're much better taters
A	and erm they tastes better they're better for you cos you don't
B	the
[ANNOTATION]	The things that come from the farm are better but they have to be cleaned	Entailment
A	mm
B	alright mate I said yeah
A	mm
B	they're dirty
A	oh really? that was nice of her
B	yeah
A	very nice
B	they are nice taters
A	you don't that's the problem with
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	the mate of person Bis a nice person	Neutral
A	don't know how good those you don't know if there's actually any vitamins left in it any more
B	no
A	cos it's travelled so far
B	they don't
A	there's a thing they do to apples now
B	yeah
A	and then you go and bite into it it's got no flavour it turns to powder in your mouth
B	and look at the stuff they spray in in with the steam now to keep it
A	no pesticide oh yeah yeah still a bit moist in there
[ANNOTATION]	now a days all the things get artificial and there is no vitamins in the fruits	Entailment
B	that's that's all it is
A	shiny
B	and when they
A	start rotting
B	that's what you want is grow your own
A	but you need a nice bit of land land land's too expensive yes
B	that garden ain't no good for grain
[ANNOTATION]	Planting by you own is not good	Contradiction
A	yes
B	it's got a shingle underneath there
A	no it's not very big anyway I suppose for you and mum it might be alright
A	land has gone too expensive
B	I mean
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	some runner beans
A	mm
B	yeah
A	you can't afford to buy it
B	it's like you go to France you can have a horse steak there's nothing wrong with that
A	yeah
B	the trouble is
A	that you're now eating
B	and now you're eating it
A	it's not just horses cows too
B	oh yeah
A	chickens
B	yeah yeah
A	probably pigs
B	yeah
A	er
B	yeah
B	and she said well nan never used to eat that many vegetables and that and I said yeah but nan never
A	yeah
B	I think the only processed meat
A	it's not the same
B	when we was young was a tin of spam or corned beef
A	or corned beef exactly
B	that was it
A	now you got everything in your freezer everything
B	but I don't eat I've never ate it anyway
A	even when you buy like you said a steak from the shops you don't

B	no
A	cow's been treated with
B	no
A	now you don't eat any frozen stuff there's barely anything in your freezer
B	I don't eat
A	no
A	it's not really meat that's why
B	no
A	oh
B	and the other six days a week it's fish
A	fish

A	just gotta take your chances with some things haven't you?
B	well you have yeah
A	got this far I suppose dad
