B	so it says in here to only give them
A	ah
B	morning breakfast tea and bedtime
A	yes I think that's what I did with you I think I just fed you at lunchtime and then erm probably and
B	well what do I do if he wakes up in the middle of the night?
A	don't give him a meal
B	well obviously not
A	but yes he can still have some milk but
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	erm those herbal juices instead
B	yeah
A	which was that like do they still do that? it was like a powder that went in the water
B	I think so yeah
A	so it's really water so it's just the case of erm
B	mm yeah
A	oh have they? well that's the easiest way to do it because erm
B	mm hm yeah yeah
A	do they tell you what to do with it there?
B	one to two
A	I'd just add maybe a drop of water
B	yeah
A	when you mash it and when you boil it and obviously as it boils it goes to a mush
B	yeah
A	just reduce it down in a pan that's all
B	fruit
A	and I don't
B	first the baby should have purees of fruits like apples and pears
A	do they puree it as well or do they just do they actually put it in the machine to
B	erm
A	mm
B	yes
A	crikey what's wrong with little plastic spoons we used to have?
B	mm
A	mm hm
B	heat and then or steam for the same amount of time
A	oh they have pureed it after that?
B	if steaming add some of the boiled water from the bottom of the steamer to thin out the puree
A	and graduate to apple crumble then can't you
B	yes he'll be on that in no time
A	so you
B	yeah I could just do it in there couldn't I?
A	yes
B	I've got a handheld one as well like a blitzer thing
A	oh have you?
B	yes but then I'll
A	just wash them really well I mean you this you're coming to the point where
B	well yeah
A	they're eating now and and
B	mm
A	you know?
B	he's got his hands in his mouth all the time his hands aren't sterilised
A	no no I mean you're you're getting to the
A	er yeah you just need to be very clean so
B	yeah
A	that's practically sterilising it anyway
B	mm
A	no I never sterilised anything cos I I had erm
B	yeah okay
A	Magimix
B	mm
A	but it was like with the Magimix the blade's almost as big as the bowl
B	oh okay
A	so it really does
B	yeah
A	loads of lumps in it but if I stick it in the Magimix
B	it does it
A	it's completely smooth
B	okay
A	yeah so if if you're gonna be doing them if you're gonna be bothering to use it you know you may as well do two or three apples
B	yeah
A	and fill an ice cube tray
B	okay
A	yeah
A	wait until they've you know ripened
B	mm
A	taste it yourself
A	have a bite out of it first
B	yeah
A	then as long as it's nice and because there's no point doing it when it's
B	yeah he's not gonna
A	they're not gonna like it either just like you wouldn't
B	won't eat it
A	so make sure it's it's nice and ripe and like so just taste it
B	okay
A	and if you would eat it then he'll eat it
B	yep
A	and peaches and
B	hopefully
A	strawberries is a funny one cos they can have allergies to that can't they? strawberries
B	yeah
A	are the one they say to leave for a bit
B	peaches and mangoes I think now you can get mangoes
A	oh mangoes
B	cos mangoes are soft aren't they?
A	they'd be good
B	yes mm hm
A	supposed to be very healthy
B	well yeah that one is isn't it?
A	all this talk of
B	are we talking about your food?
A	food
B	are we talking about your food?
A	yeah
B	erm no
A	he doesn't get hungry though does he? he's not
B	well it's the middle of the night it's twice that's why I'm
A	hello smiler
B	that's why I'm thinking well
A	are you waking up happy?
B	it's probably
A	yes
B	good
A	how are those legs
B	mm
A	are they not giving you any trouble today?
A	sticking needles in you haven't they?
B	all for his own good
A	that's not fun
A	ooh what does that mean? does that mean you can drink it quicker?
B	yes it means it's very fast-flow it pours out like a
A	oh
B	probably
A	the next thing we know
B	try one of these
B	we raved about them when I was
A	we're eating your rusks
B	okay right
A	oh I tell you what they're half the size unless I've just got bigger
B	are they?
A	they don't look as big I used to love snacking on these
B	they're alright
A	yeah it's nice
B	mm
A	that's nice still oh yeah oh they haven't messed with those
A	mm they're lovely
B	mm
A	yes
B	and mix with
A	warm milk
B	mix with fruit puree custard or yogurt mm custard
A	ooh no no don't mess with it warm yogurt it's the only way to eat them
B	mm
A	you don't get so that that's a good one I mean that's what I would go for if I had the baby rice
B	yeah
A	or porridge that mashed into the water put it in the milk cos it just breaks down to nothing
B	yeah
A	mm
B	no not like this as well
A	no
B	mm
A	mm
B	oh yes please
A	yes we don't want a fuss do we
B	okay
A	get the milk maid
B	shall we try level oh no
A	oh are you gonna sneeze?
B	we shall stick with our level twos for now
A	smile if you think I'm cheeky
B	as we haven't sterilised our level threes

B	okay
A	hm?

B	two point five
A	just a tiny little bit then
B	it's ready
A	hey hey hey
B	it's ready
A	oh
B	ready ready ready
A	come on
B	there we go it's done it's done
A	there oops
B	excellent
A	good

B	yeah
A	oh
B	yeah
A	there we are then that'll be alright won't it? ooh you were ready for that weren't you?
B	mm hm
A	it's better when it's warm isn't it?
B	it's nice and warm
A	what does it go up to is that it? the biggest the fastest flow level three?
B	yeah
A	when do they recommend those from?
B	six months
A	six months?
B	well they recommend those from
A	he's just ahead of the game
B	well we can't be waiting around forever
A	well not when he was born
B	yeah
A	oh
B	whereas I think if he gets it quicker then
A	could be
B	er eleven o'clock on Saturday they're coming around
A	oh nice
B	so I'll wrap his birthday present up for then
A	you'll find out what he's doing with his job how long he's gonna stop in Aberdeen for?
B	yeah we don't know cos are they
A	mm hm
B	and then they've asked us if we want to go out for lunch
A	you don't know what his leaving date was then or?
B	I've no idea
A	okay
B	down though and not to tell anyone but now obviously he
A	well it's one of those things isn't it?
B	yes
A	I mean he said himself he was expecting it at Christmas so
B	expecting it yeah yeah definitely so we'll er so I'll ask him on Saturday
A	is
B	I think so
A	is she in London every week apart from when she goes to Aberdeen or does she come back?
B	yeah yeah no I think she's in well she's
A	right
B	cos
A	mm
B	I don't know if he's had any interviews or
B	well
A	oh if I was
A	yep
B	mm
A	with his qualifications and the industry
B	yeah if he can get a well
A	she'd get something as well
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	oh they should definitely do it while they've not got a house not got kids
B	yeah
A	they really should
B	is he renting his one in Aberdeen?
A	yeah
B	mm
A	never bought it
B	yeah
A	cos he was never like he didn't know how long he was gonna be up there originally because he thought there'd be a
B	no
A	a move to Gatwick or somewhere else on the cards
B	yeah
A	so I don't think he'd have bought anywhere
B	no it would have been a bit silly to buy somewhere isn't it?
A	but they should they should definitely go
B	yeah yeah
A	Dubai
B	Dubai yeah well no
A	wouldn't she? why?
B	no
A	mm
B	it's all a bit
B	it's all a bit like that maybe a few years maybe when she's actually married to him
A	well I'm getting
B	no I think they need to still be working at a distance away from each other cos the more time they spend together the more they don't like each other
B	don't they
A	they're looking forward to seeing you
B	of course you've grown up a lot since they saw you last
A	everybody wants to see you are you gonna smile and laugh?
B	I think
A	they're going to swoon
B	I think so
A	have you not seen him since then then? you couldn't have done
B	well no but no I don't think he's been back since
A	right
B	no
B	she's apparently delivering another high chair that her sister is giving to us
A	is she?
B	yeah a high chair and there was a couple of a stroller
A	oh that's nice then
B	yeah so
A	so you'll be holiday ready with that?
A	really?
B	flights accommodation and excursions
A	well that's okay
B	yeah I said oh you've found all that for
A	that's well that's perfect isn't it? and that was the half-term week?
B	no I don't think it's the half-term week it was like a
A	oh
B	er Friday to
A	but that would work with your part-time work
A	oh so and that would be much cheaper probably would it
A	than half-term?
B	oh yeah I don't imagine you could get that for in half-term
A	oh that that would be really good
A	how long's the flight it's only two two hours?
B	I don't know I'll have to ask him
A	do you want to have a rest from this for a minute Mr
A	a standstill
B	right
A	we just wanted to stop a minute
B	oh excellent
A	it's coming out that end mum
B	that's marvellous thank you for that
B	my favourite thing to deal with is that
A	yeah it's more nappies
A	more nappies eh
B	have a bit of this make it easier
A	some teething gel on she's got a nice jumpsuit on on the telly I like that
B	oh yeah well if you're that size
A	she's got big legs when she wears short skirts
B	what do you mean? oh big legs
A	yeah
B	I thought you meant long legs
A	no no she's got a lovely figure but it's her legs and her
A	oh look that's nice a swimming pool there
B	yes nanny that's what we need
A	are you trying to poo?
A	are you?
B	yeah
A	oh he would?
B	if we can find cheaper flights
A	it's just the I know it's the expensive flights isn't it?
B	mm
A	oh we'd have some fun wouldn't we
B	yeah
A	cos if it got dirty that would you know you can't take him there
B	no no you wouldn't take him in there
A	but the last couple of years if that I think whether they've put a new filter in or something
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	it's been really good
B	yeah
A	so that would be perfect wouldn't it for you?
B	it's not good is it?
B	maybe
A	mm? shall we see?
B	yeah
A	there we are
B	hopefully
A	she didn't come on Tuesday
B	what's she doing?
A	er
B	is that it?
A	yeah
B	that's good then
A	why?
B	well if you're having your nails done that might be a bit of a problem
A	no and we've got pops there as well and we know how useful he is
B	oh

A	and you're not going swimming with him while he's got his cold presumably either?
B	no we left it this week we'll go again next week

[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B will revisit next week.	Entailment
B	when your nose is cleared up when when
B	there we go
B	there we go
B	nice big a
A	where's
B	you've demolished your seven ounces this morning
A	oh well there we are that's why we're not quite so hungry
B	but we've got to eat more in the day
A	oh so we don't get up at night
[ANNOTATION]	The speakers already eat a lot during the day.	Contradiction
B	so we'll stop
A	have you tried water at night or?
B	no oh he won't go back to sleep on that
A	does he have a lot to drink a lot of milk still then in the night?
B	well he didn't actually at one o'clock he only had a couple of ounces but then at yeah five o'clock I think he nearly had his whole bottle but that was fair enough at five o'clock and I thought well if he goes
A	yeah well may well maybe the one o'clock maybe try not giving him milk
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B has a baby to feed with milk.	Neutral
B	shall we try some water?
A	if he you know maybe that's the one
B	oh great thank you
A	just
B	all over me
A	just to settle him a bit
B	mm
A	cos you can't tell us can you?
B	are you watching the milk?
B	she's not really but you don't know that
A	shall we put it in nanny's coffee?
B	nanny's gonna have it
A	is that for me?
B	is he not hungry for it any more?
B	oh dear
A	hey monkey
B	mm
A	do you want it?
B	yeah
A	what does that mean?
B	mm I don't really know
A	what does that mean?
B	I think I'll just have my fingers instead
A	so where does your friend live who we met with the twins is she in
B	I think so yeah I don't know her that well
A	she just did the course with you?
B	yeah she did the course
A	didn't she?
B	no
A	why is that funny
B	I don't know why she didn't turn up to most of it but she just wasn't very
A	did she?
B	so I don't know if she's going back
A	were they early the twins?
B	yes they were
A	yeah
B	I think they're about cos I saw her and she was thirty weeks and she looked as if she was about to give birth
A	was that in
B	I don't know
A	no
B	as I say I don't know her that well
A	no
B	we just knew that she had twins
A	so what dates did you put down to go and look around the school
B	erm
A	so they'll get back to you
B	yeah and tell me what
A	yeah
B	is good for them
A	is it the same sized school as the
B	what the one I'm at at the moment?
A	yeah
B	it's too it's a bit bigger cos it's two-form all the way up so it
A	oh is it?
B	yeah
A	oh
B	pardon
A	was that you? hm?
B	maybe it was
A	was that you?
B	yes
A	still here
B	so if nanny wants to have you one day that would be fabulous while I go out
A	what do you think
B	at the doctor's screaming
A	oh
B	screaming
A	oh dear
B	for
A	yes
B	no more for eight months
A	yes till you're a year old
B	that's all good
B	yes so happy about that aren't we?
A	do you want some more?
B	happy about that? let's see can you create a bit more room
A	be quick cos nanny is having it
B	mm
A	we had erm one of the girls yesterday who's at signing class came in halfway through
B	mm
A	with her leg in
B	plaster?
A	no not in plaster she's had she had a knee operation she's only
B	oh
A	so she had it all splinted so she can't bend her knee
B	okay
A	she had shorts on she must have been freezing and she was on crutches
B	yeah
A	she had shorts on
B	yeah
A	and her mum was with her and erm she said well I don't think our insurance covers you to be in the building
B	oh wow okay
A	well you know fair comment cos I I remember that happened when
B	yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	you know
B	oh dear
A	so what so
B	yeah
A	I'm gonna leave er er but you're not to get up or move or leave this room
B	oh
A	so we all had our tea break we brought our tea in so we could all sit with her and
B	sit with her yeah
A	yeah but it was erm
B	oh dear
A	I don't know if she's gonna hobble in every time like that
B	mm
A	but she's she's very young to have a knee operation and she did tell me she was having it
B	well
A	yeah
B	so it's
A	yeah
B	those sorts
A	somebody else turned up half an hour late because of the traffic
B	oh dear
A	we were much better
B	mm
A	so she signs to the person opposite and they sign back to us she said right I'm gonna do time now so I'm gonna give you some times and you have to sign it back and then she realised that we only knew half past and hours
B	okay
A	so she was trying to teach us
B	no
A	so we were doing
B	yeah yeah
A	money's from your chin
B	mm
A	time is from your cheek so we would go one o'clock like that
B	mm hm
A	two o'clock three o'clock she oh there's a rainbow out there she just does erm
B	oh
B	yeah
A	and then we
B	mm
A	half past one
B	okay
A	and that's for quarter to
B	yeah
A	so you're just pointing to where the she goes imagine that's an arrow and you're just pointing to where
B	yeah
A	she does it all signing so
B	but it's you it's
A	I understood
B	to you not to the person?
A	yeah yeah she says so imagine you've got the clock in front of you
B	mm
A	and you're so your quarter past three and then quarter past five quarter past nine yeah?
B	mm
A	or quarter to twelve
B	mm hm
A	so she says you know do it
B	oh
A	so I think erm
B	okay
A	ten past two
B	okay
A	ten past five
B	okay
A	so so you you're doing your ten and then you're moving your hand in a past motion so that made sense
B	mm hm
A	you know ten and she goes hold it kind of where your ten would be
B	yeah
A	so ten past ten to was harder ten to one ten to two
B	okay
A	so you
B	yeah
A	nine was a bit it's harder to get the movement with your hand or
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	ten to twelve
B	yeah
A	but I could see where she was going with that and loads of people couldn't get it so you're either moving like that or you're doing that
B	yeah
A	which makes sense then we were doing twenty which is twenty past two
B	yeah
A	and making a nought that way
B	yeah
A	twenty to two
B	yeah
A	twenty to
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	she goes you've just got to practise this now with this with this hand movement we didn't do twenty-five so I wonder what that would be?
B	mm
A	for
B	okay
A	but then
B	yeah mm
A	yeah yeah
B	mm yeah yeah yeah
A	you'd do it like that
A	but she was she's told us so many different ways to what
B	mm
A	she doesn't she does that for week
B	okay
A	T and V
B	yeah
A	she's no use that or use that aerial sign she goes
B	oh wow okay
A	she goes BSL is more about structures cos she's just put some people go I think was that a quarter?
B	okay
A	she goes that's English cos you're doing quarter and you're doing past
B	mm
A	whereas BSL is quarter past is one word or one movement
B	yeah yeah yeah which you think it should be for
A	yeah so she says but a lot of people will go
B	cos otherwise you may as well be spelling it all out with the alphabet
A	well this is yeah so it made sense what she's saying
B	yeah
A	and then the other thing she's gonna do next week now we're gonna be timed to do this
B	okay
A	on the alphabet cos she's fingerspelling every week to us
B	yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	still she said your fingerspelling's really poor which it is
B	oh wow
A	so
A	B X Y
B	probably about fifteen seconds
A	do you reckon? we'll have to time it but
B	yeah
A	I think if you get you'd have to get
B	yeah
A	so I think if you get it you know
B	yeah
A	R S
B	yeah into like threes and get the hang of it follow us upstairs
A	because
B	yeah I know you've said that last week
A	cos yeah
B	oh
B	right okay
A	she was amazed I'd got I'd got what she signed but she didn't know
B	yeah yeah
A	what she was signing to me how weird is that?
B	that's a bit odd isn't it
A	yeah that was cos I could see the look on her face but she
B	mm
A	palm up instead of palm down she'll just put
B	yeah that's what you said yeah
A	cos she's just doing it
B	well especially for a word like week that
A	well she was that's cos she was there yeah we yeah
B	I'm gonna have to put him down
A	rather than putting her hands moving her hand right around it's just W and the E E K was all
B	yeah
A	but I missed she's I missed Tuesday and got it I spelt today
B	oh
A	erm I didn't I didn't see her doing she was too
B	ah
B	and you just went T O?
A	yeah I went in the
B	ah
A	and that's the sign for no
B	okay
B	yeah
A	and then erm
B	yeah
A	but she does the sign so when she spells out a name
B	yeah
A	she then does the sign at the end so the they sign to me
B	okay
A	so you know if you've got your word right
B	oh yeah
A	cos when she does the fingerspelling as well when
A	so obviously she's done N A M E and I've
B	mm
A	written it down so then
B	yeah
A	that
B	mm
A	so we all knew we'd spelt it right
B	mm
A	and she's doing this she's doing this sign
B	okay mm
A	no
B	yeah
A	what have you been learning?
B	ah
B	yeah
A	and she's yes that that is correct but in a lot of the context if you really wanna it's like if you said to me can I go home?
B	mm
A	no
B	oh
A	it's not you know not no or not
B	ah okay
A	no
B	yeah
B	yeah
B	okay
A	so we've got a bit of work to do
B	mm
A	we've got a bit of work to do
B	gosh you might do it a bit more in in-depth a little bit
A	but I understood her a lot more this week
B	oh that's good
A	she signs
B	go through the alphabet obviously she needs
A	yes it's it's because she's not going over new stuff she's just I mean we learnt structuring and she said and we learnt let you know let me know
B	mm hm
A	that was a
B	which is yeah that's
A	cos that's that
B	yes yes that's
A	well that no that's Wolverhampton
B	that's Wol yeah
A	but this way she was making like an L
B	okay
B	mm
A	let me know
B	okay
A	so we were getting phrases so they were quite good to
B	I see
A	so yeah I did her understand her more but she signs a lot differently her hands seem to be
B	mm
A	a lot looser and she'll
B	yeah
A	you know she's just she says you've got to do that you've got to loosen up completely with it
B	yeah
A	and and lip read a lot more with her
B	yes mm hm
A	and get the context from lip reading
B	yeah
A	but she's mouthing prefer so sometimes you're wondering what she's signing she's doing but
B	did erm
A	yeah yeah yeah she yeah
B	she doesn't speak does she?
A	she doesn't speak but
A	yeah I think she was losing the will to live with us and then she says I'm gonna stop because you all look like you're
B	yeah they need to come off now
A	is she?
B	good boy
A	are we pulling plasters off?
B	just a bit
A	ooh ooh ooh
B	they are on tight today
A	ooh that's no fun is it?
B	is it tickling?
B	is it tickly?
A	oh
B	tickly
A	oh
B	it's tickly
A	you're not sure if that hurts a little bit
B	is it a little bit tickly?
A	let's see
B	oh
A	oh and another one to come off
B	it's a little bit tickly yes cos there's three
A	look at those chunky legs
B	there's three
A	look you've got chunky legs just like your mummy
B	yeah
A	ooh oh that hurts oh that hurts
B	there we go there we go there we go it's all finished it's all finished it's all finished it's all done it's all done now it's all done now

B	well done good boy
A	no
B	you didn't really notice you're not having yours on for four weeks
B	nope not happening

B	that's quite right isn't it?
A	who wears their plaster for four weeks?
B	mm
A	are they looking alright?
B	they're looking just fine aren't they?
A	yeah
B	it's just whether the plasters come off
A	there's not a little bruise no
B	no
A	no you've done very well there's not a mark on you
B	I've done superbly
A	there's not a mark on you

B	a bit of Calpol no it's not nice
A	well they haven't messed about with the rusks too much they're still good
B	mm
A	yes
B	yeah
A	but I don't know how she's gonna fit in
B	no
A	because she hasn't taught anything new and now we're recapping time
B	yeah
A	all we've done is time and fingerspelling
B	mm
B	oh
A	seven she doesn't start at seven and she wanders in
B	oh okay what erm
A	no and then we have a break and then we do it until nine
B	oh okay
A	but erm
B	a bit wet that bib isn't it?
A	I think she did see she was losing us
B	yeah
A	I suppose cos we've suddenly got somebody new and she comes in and she's doing quite a lot of signing and we're not following it at all
B	yeah yeah
A	erm and she just says just stop me just
B	okay
A	I'll write it I will write the word
B	yeah
A	and she's mouthing it and I've got it and a few people and then she saw somebody speak to somebody else
B	don't oh
A	and she was I will write out so she wrote it on the board
B	yeah
A	this is the sign for structure
B	oh
A	so she just goes around quickly I want to see all of you do you know your ten past or whatever so she just goes around
B	oh okay
A	and watches
B	well that's good then
A	do it she just corrects you straightaway and moves on and then she comes back to see you do it again
B	okay well that's
A	she doesn't kind of
B	no no no
A	she'll just quickly
B	that's good then cos you don't get
A	no no
B	you can't do it do it again
A	no
B	what you thought though then she was gonna be a bit?

B	oh yeah
A	because she started the course and then her father died
B	oh
A	erm and she was given time off
B	yeah
A	so that they said well we'll postpone it if you like and she'd got partway through it so
B	oh okay so

B	yeah
A	you would have been in car seats then cos we took our car on the boat but the first trip abroad was you were four and six when we went to Portugal
B	yeah
A	and er you'd have just been in seat belts then
B	mm
A	and to be honest you're probably alright when you're that age
B	four and six?
A	yeah to be in a seat belt
B	yeah yeah
A	I mean you can't it's not allowed here
B	no
A	any more erm

A	yeah
B	so we'll give it another half an hour
A	yeah
B	and then
A	until his next feed
B	from half past two till half past four hopefully
A	there'll be no heating on at mine either
A	we can put the fire on
B	why don't you get in touch with pops and say put the heating on now?
A	could do
B	radical well you
A	is he there?
B	like to do that
A	will he listen?
B	bless you
A	oh
B	bless you
A	oh
B	that's not that's not pleasant is it?
A	I might ask him
B	do you need to be lifted up?
A	I might ask him to build the fire as well
B	oh are you gonna have the fire on at nanny's?
A	I had it on this week it was nice
B	are you gonna have the fire on? you've still got nappies around yours haven't you?
A	er did you well it depends how many you use in a night
B	what's the matter
A	how many nappies did you use?
A	eh?
B	a few
B	we'll take some more
A	before daddy walked in the door
B	we'll take some more
A	I don't know how many's left it depends how many you use of a night
A	I have to turn my er wi-fi off at home now to get erm Facebook to load
A	yeah it's like erm
B	you're actually choosing to use three G right so I think
A	four G now isn't it?
B	hold your nappies for me thank you
A	well I thought I can check erm
B	look he's got them he's ready
B	oh on there yeah I saw that mm hm
A	yeah you've seen it?
B	oh dear
A	four G cos that's it's so poor the wi-fi at home
B	really slow
A	well I don't mind because it is it is cheap
B	yes
A	so I suppose it's
B	well I'd mind
A	well I wouldn't use it that much so
B	mm
A	you know I can put up with it
B	oh yeah
A	well we haven't had that
B	no
A	so your dad logged on and they says oh you don't qualify for anything
B	oh great
A	so which is wrong they've got
B	yeah
A	ah so
B	ah
A	I've I've left him to phone up about that as well so
A	so yes
B	right how am I going to position this heater because I can't keep putting it there because it's not
A	you need to be warm don't you
B	mm
A	mm
B	yes yes indeed
A	you need to be warm
B	if I try and put it is that gonna be long enough
A	you need to be warm
B	I don't know
A	you're such a happy baby you're such a happy baby
B	no not yet
A	oh that's a shame
B	mm we'll see where that goes
A	yes
B	surely there's more than one socket in this room?
A	probably behind the cot
B	I can't put it too close to the cot though can I?
A	well no but yeah I'm just saying where there might be a socket on this wall
B	mm
A	I can't see
B	where is the socket?
A	so that just comes on and off in the night?
B	well yeah so I'll set it and I turn it on when we go to bed cos the heating's on before we
A	oh it is safe it's not likely to burst into flames is it?
B	no
A	are you sure? I don't like things like that I like to be if I've got an electric heater I like to be in the room with it the same when we had them at work they're they are
B	that's fine
A	dangerous
B	that's absolutely it's not high enough to do any damage
A	alright
B	it's only thermostat one the lowest setting
A	alright then
B	if it's on thermostat one it keeps it at about nineteen degrees which he needs it at
A	I might come and sleep in here as well
B	at sixteen degrees
A	then
B	sixteen degrees absolutely freezing when I came in here the other day
A	oh
B	in the middle of the night and they said oh yeah sixteen degrees is ideal for a baby's room and I thought no it's not
A	it is if you're a little boy isn't it? it gets too hot
B	it's not
A	has mummy put all those nappies on you again?
B	why are you taking them off? you need them
A	not all at once now
B	yes
A	so you're thinking if he's only gonna have half his bottle now he may as well have a bit of food as well?
B	well I'm gonna try him on these level three teats and hopefully he'll take it all again
A	yeah
B	and then once he starts to take all of his all of his bottles in a day then he'll stop waking up at night but then if that still doesn't work then
A	are you listening to this
B	I think I'm gonna try in about well
A	this is the plan
B	if I don't start before four and a half months I'm gonna start by then anyway four and a half five months because it'll take him a month to get used to
B	won't you?
A	right well I sent a message to your dad to build the fire and we haven't heard back so I imagine we'll get there and it'll be cold
B	no
A	never mind
B	well if he's if he's receiving them on the internet and he's got wi-fi and it'll probably take him a year to cope
