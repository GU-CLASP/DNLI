B	well I dunno
C	don't think its
B	I'd have to read up on it to really know if I wanted to stay in or not
C	as well there's less I think since they had the Euro as well it's not done them any favours because it's their currency used to be it sort of things used to be a lot cheaper over there so they get loads of tourists and there's a lot less tourists going so
