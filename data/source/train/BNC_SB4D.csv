D	you can have that one
E	was that the one you hoped for or the other one?

A	we were on scooter
C	yeah
A	yeah
A	I find it fast when I come back to England okay what's the challenge?
B	you have to eat five meats in one go
A	five? but you're only having one that's not fair I'll do two
E	you eat yours then all of yours first
C	half doesn't count
A	I'm waiting

C	what about that?
A	oh yeah
A	big brother will come and show me how
A	go on then

A	mm
E	oh my god I think I've eaten it so quickly I'm like stuffed
A	it's a lovely dinner

B	like this
E	just eat put a bit in your mouth put it in your mouth please
D	been the last year on a different time zone I mean it's weird isn't it?
C	yeah it's weird
C	it does take a day or two to kind of adjust
D	yeah
C	so I'd never
D	I I
E	yeah
C	yeah the whole day yeah it didn't stop we just kept chasing the sun I think and that's it's a bit weird so it was like seven in the morning but it was still light
B	just to have it
D	and how long was the trip like fifteen hours or something?
C	yeah and we didn't fly until one thirty in the afternoon
E	on
D	that's just bizarre and then you're landing pretty much
A	when it's still light
D	when it's still light
A	yeah yeah it was just getting dark
E	one thirty when? on the Friday?
C	no one thirty
E	on the Saturday
C	don't forget that Korea's ahead in time
E	mm
C	and it was like eight or nine hours ahead
D	I was thinking just chasing the sun setting
C	so in time on a clock it only took me about five hours to get home
E	where did you fly to?
C	sometimes it hits you harder than other times
D	so you came from Tokyo?
C	came from Incheon
A	did you?
C	mm
E	where's Incheon?
D	that's where we were looking at the flights wasn't it?
E	it said via Tokyo didn't it?
C	mm
E	Moscow via Tokyo
C	mm
D	oh so did you have
C	and that was that was that plane
E	oh
C	I came from Incheon to Moscova on a different plane
D	oh
C	that plane had come from Tokyo
D	mm
C	that confused me too when I got to the carousel it was like
D	that's it
E	oh okay
C	why does it say Tokyo?
E	oh right so you weren't actually on that plane?
C	no I don't know why they just
E	but they just put the wrong name on
C	didn't say it was from Moscow
E	oh okay
C	I didn't really understand
C	no no
E	okay darling have a look at this one
B	I don't want to look at it
E	I think this is for Fred cos he's so pleased with you
E	we had a great trip out didn't we when was that?
B	I don't want any more
E	I think we need to cos there's nothing else
C	I think that doesn't
D	that could have been any one
C	doesn't help you feel good though cos if you're like first flight have like
A	yeah
C	and then the next flight have the same again and then there's still the same
E	mm
D	mm
A	why is it that
C	I find it necessary for
A	really?
C	she's a nervous wreck until she has a drink
E	is she getting worse did you say?
C	er no she's not getting worse
E	mm
C	like oh she I mean
E	does she really?
C	yeah
E	mm
C	it really doesn't help
A	how does the
E	are you going to eat your carrots then?
C	she wasn't crying a lot just tearful
A	just take a
C	yeah well we took a Tamazepam which was an anxiety tablet
D	did it work?
E	leave the cat alone please
C	yeah to a certain degree
D	yeah I can imagine that
C	mm
E	I'll go and get him up in the shower
C	if I'm on my own I'm not not really bothered
D	did she have ever like a bad flight or anything?
C	yeah that was
E	oh god
C	you couldn't hold a drink you couldn't do anything you couldn't watch anything or listen to anything it was just literally like this
E	oh my goodness
C	for like four hours and since that flight
E	yeah
C	she was and I was actually for the first few flights after that but then I I got over it she kind of hasn't
A	sounds horrible
E	mm
C	yeah I've never had that kind of turbulence again and we were flying over the edge of the Himalayas and the sun was setting seeing all the hot air and the cold air like
E	oh okay
C	you can imagine
A	thank you
C	was he hissing?
A	oh yeah the cat he's going to get scratched
D	you leave her alone
A	leave her alone now
D	just open the door

C	mm
E	have to get the old Cubans out anyway

E	no hurry anyway
D	ah and some
E	okay say night night to everybody I don't think I'll be able to race you up

D	you're turning into a really good cook these days
E	I'm going to do dolly sticks I've done a lot of it lately
C	does anyone want the odd potato a bit more carrot?
D	mm?
B	daddy can we have a race up there?
E	I've done much of it lately
D	mm it was really good really good
B	daddy can we have a race up there?
D	me? no not me mummy's
E	I'm going slow motion
D	mummy's gonna race you
E	come on cos I need to cut your nails and that tonight ready for holiday
D	you you stand that end
E	no I'm standing here and I'm gonna go slow motion and you can run okay?
D	well mummy's got look we've given him a little bit of a head start and then you can have a head start
D	mummy's got a bad leg so we need to step back a step back step back go quick go
C	getting him excited
D	oh well yeah
A	at least if he smashes his head against something we've got proves that he hasn't been beaten up
C	yeah it was an accident
A	yeah
C	but I remember I had that much energy when I was younger but
D	yeah mum was saying earlier wasn't she that
C	yeah
D	that a bit like that
A	where does it go?
C	I have no idea I was saying that perhaps we're feeding him too much
D	he doesn't actually eat that great
C	no
D	like he doesn't eat a great deal
C	no didn't see him eat that much then
D	mm
C	it's a super metabolism
D	erm my aunty says I was very very energetic yeah mum says I wasn't as much so
C	yeah
D	yeah well my mum says that no you weren't like that at all you had lots energy or whatever but you used to play football and and run around and stuff but
C	it's definitely harder having boys I think than having girls
D	yeah
C	seems to be at least when you're younger I think girls get a bit harder when you get older maybe mm boys are more
D	they're more fun boys
C	they're more fun?
D	mm definitely yeah
C	mm
A	it's probably a
D	oh you I don't know you
C	seems like seems like a lot it seems like a of work
D	yeah
A	probably experience it
D	it's a line life changing moment
C	yeah it's a massive massive experience
D	yeah a massive experience
C	a big thing to miss out on I just wish there was another ten years that would be really nice
D	oh do they?
C	she's quite worried about that yeah because we've kind of discussed and said maybe like when we're forty maybe we'd like a child then
D	yeah
C	so we can kind of focus on career and our life and the next ten years erm
D	no way really?
C	really young
D	bloody hell it is young yeah
C	so she's quite worried about it
D	mm
C	but then we've discussed it again and said well if it comes to that and we want a child we'll adopt so
D	yeah definitely yeah a huge
C	really weird
D	mm
C	looking down at another person and being
D	I found it more enjoyable having
C	yeah
D	the two girls in the twenties
C	when you were younger
D	yeah yeah you're more you're more chilled out about things
C	you know how to deal with them were you stricter with
D	no I don't think so I've not really been strict with either of them to be honest or any of them but
C	mum was definitely kind of strict no?
D	yeah and she's still fairly strict with
C	yeah
D	yeah my mum did that to me once
C	that's not very nice
D	I don't know what I said I must have said something bad but
C	yeah
A	that happened to me as well
C	did she do that to you?
A	it was either her or dad
C	lovely
A	yeah
C	one was cos I did like a back flip on a bouncy castle I fell on my neck and like really hurt myself so I kind of just went shit right out loud and she took me away from the school fete
C	erm you got away with it loads though I got grounded all the bloody time should tell you we weren't er even allowed could games console until I was about fourteen or fifteen or something
D	really?
C	yeah and then I finally got a Mega Drive when everyone else was on like N64 or something so that was quite a bit out of date
A	and then everyone wants to play with you we had to turn the blood from red to green
C	yeah had to have green blood of course we switched it back to red as soon as we could
A	it's just stupid
C	yeah might be why I'm not that into computing I would say
A	mm
C	have you still got a console knocking around?
D	PlayStation 2 though
C	yeah
D	what's it on PlayStation 4 now I think isn't it?
C	oh shit yeah I haven't even seen that latest generation
A	neither have I
D	totally missed out on PlayStation 3
C	you never played it?
D	well
C	mm
D	and it looked in amazing to be honest
C	yeah
D	and I played a little bit of that but no totally missed out on PlayStation 3
C	yeah the last one I had was a it's the same generation Xbox was it? Xbox was PlayStation 2 yeah
D	yeah Xbox was the same yeah PlayStation 2 yeah
C	had one of those I quite liked that I threw it out the window though cos it pissed me off
D	can get a bit annoying yeah
C	mum was saying
D	yeah I can get a bit
C	they really annoy me
D	yeah they can get a bit annoying yeah
C	it's cos we always probably buy the cheap ones and they just don't ever work properly and
D	you chucked it out the window
C	I threw it out of the window yeah and it was like two
D	well it was warned
C	two stories up
D	you told it
C	you just felt a bit
A	did you have to check that no one was down there?
C	yeah I smashed one of my old laptops as well just cos I got angry with it
A	oh no
C	punched it twice
D	I hate technology
C	yeah
D	I hate computers
C	that's why I really shouldn't there's three fifty that was my limit and I was like I'm not spending any more than that on a
D	well I was
A	on erm and Apple's rubbish so I got this Sony thing and then six months later oh the buttons don't work
C	yeah I know
A	it's annoying
C	what's annoying is that
A	it could
C	it's not just at the gym it's just whenever
A	whenever oh yeah I remember that happening when
A	we were in a hotel in Korea and you showed me
C	yeah it's really annoying yeah
A	rubbish
C	I think that guitar was a bit buggered as soon as I got it and like everything else I just I don't
D	yeah
C	so have you just set it
D	it took a while
C	yeah
D	yeah just set it yeah
C	and you have to pull that one up
D	cos it is erm it's difficult to tune if you don't set it
C	yeah it kept going out of tune when I had it
D	yeah it will do yeah
C	I thought what's going on
D	so yeah I've just set it so it doesn't didn't move so
C	the tremolo no kind of annoying
D	yeah
C	cos I bought it for that purpose
D	yeah
A	what did you use to
D	but you can take something off the back and then just you can just
A	oh right
C	you take the springs off it don't you?
D	yeah I mean you just take the springs off I don't know if I took the springs off or just wound it down
C	yeah
D	so the springs just don't work
C	didn't fit that
D	mm
C	it's fast I I like that guitar it's smooth
D	it's a nice guitar yeah
C	good for crunching
A	I don't think
D	that's no good
C	no it's no bloody good
A	you two I used to burn the top my finger in the in the er toaster yeah if I had calluses that wouldn't happen
C	no you wouldn't have felt it
A	yeah
C	I used to pick mine off
D	yeah I did I'd bite mine off
A	yeah
C	you must be pretty damn good now
D	I'm certainly a lot better than I used to be yeah
C	yeah
D	for four years of sort of playing
C	solidly
D	well yeah pretty much yes
C	mm
D	yeah been alright but it's still I'm still only like a rhythm guitar is I still can't get into that lead guitar
C	yeah
D	my left hand just doesn't work that way
C	do you want to have you tried?
D	no not particularly no I mean it's just part of your brain
C	yeah
D	I think it's er whether it's your right side or your left side or whatever your my left hand just doesn't move quick or my my right hand moves quite quick but
C	yeah
D	you can see you can see the difference
C	it is odd to be right handed and your left hand to do all the work and
D	yeah I know it well yeah
C	that's a bit strange
D	it is totally
C	you think really your right hand should be
D	yeah but then like because I've got
C	rhythm yeah
D	and whereas as as Nick is he's sort of right-handed but plays plays left-handed
C	mm
D	so he's see he he's good at lead guitar but rubbish at rhythm guitar
A	is he no good?
D	no absolutely appalling yeah
C	it's strange that it must you must be alright then and obviously there's different the right of your brain or something what with you you're a bit of lead guitarist aren't you?
A	yeah
C	but you pick it up really quick I remember you were playing like DragonForce or something and
A	yeah but the thing is I had I never had any like basics or fundamentals so like
C	neither did I really
A	it was pretty bad like I had no guitar lessons ever
A	yeah
D	I never had any guitar lessons either
C	no?
D	never
C	no
D	no
C	you just pick it up as you go along
D	yeah
A	I I can't really be bothered at the moment I kind of want to learn piano
C	mm
A	but like that's so huge
C	that's I want I
D	mm
C	I'd love to be in a band I'm not I don't stay in a in in one place long enough really to be in a band
A	unless you wanna learn to play a kazoo or something
C	I got conned by some girl in Korea and her guitar she sold it online
D	when you tuned it properly
C	I couldn't play it it was just like a bar out or something it was ridiculous I was quite pissed
A	very annoying how much did you buy it for?
C	a hundred thousand so about a hundred dollars so maybe about sixty quid or something
A	yeah
C	not a lot of cash but I mean for a second hand crappy acoustic guitar I just trusted her I was like whatever it was just annoying because I actually had a few guitars when I was in Korea the last time I gave them all away for free I had a full sized like keyboard as well that I'd acquired
A	mm
C	and then I I when I got another guitar from somebody else and just as I went to sell it I went to restring it and the erm the peg snapped in the body of the guitar and I couldn't for the life of me get it out and I just couldn't be bothered to go to a shop to go and get it done and there wasn't one near me so I ended up selling it for like nothing to somebody just as like broken for
A	mm
D	not really unless you drill it and put a screw in it and pull it out that way but
C	mm I didn't have anything
D	if you've got no tools then
C	I tried to like I tried all sorts of things but I couldn't get it out
D	mm really the only way I could see them putting the screw in and pulling the screw out but
C	oh well so now I'm actually going to play every night
D	yeah?
C	do I have an acoustic somewhere?
D	there's obviously the acoustic as well
C	yeah
D	whenever you want
C	I should have an acoustic somewhere
D	there's one upstairs isn't there? I think there's one up in the loft
C	erm I really don't remember what the hell was that?
D	I know
C	a parakeet him screaming
A	it's a parrot?
C	so you'd like to play the piano
A	I'd like to learn
C	how about you
A	I don't know I'd like just like to get another instrument and try it and see if
D	another one yeah I wouldn't having go a ukulele
C	yeah
D	that sounds quite a laugh
C	they're quite popular now aren't they?
D	yeah
C	yeah
D	they're fairly well they're supposed to be fairly easy to play as well
C	I just it's not the same as guitar though is it the tuning
D	no the tuning's
C	yeah oh that makes sense
D	so it it's done like erm I think it's tuned to a D or something so it's only a matter of putting the like a couple of fingers on the strings and you change it
C	yeah
D	to some of the major chords that
A	it's better
C	bit small though isn't it?
D	it is but you can move around the country
A	it's tiny
C	yeah if I travel with it yeah
D	quite easily with it in your suitcase
C	it's a bit hipster now
D	yeah
C	just travel with one
D	not as easy to travel with a piano
C	no
A	I wouldn't say no to trying it
C	a harmonica?
A	yeah
C	they're really hard to play have you ever tried to play one?
A	no
C	I had one for a while
A	really?
C	I can't I don't have the time
A	you could get an ocarina and try and
C	one of my students made ocarinas
D	did they?
C	they didn't really
A	that would
C	yeah I think so it's pretty cool yeah I think I'd still like to play the trumpet I've always wanted to play the drums but when the hell are you gonna get a drum kit?
D	I know
C	and actually have space to put a drum kit in and then have neighbours that allow you to have a drum kit?
A	you could get a drum kit
D	an electric drum kit I suppose couldn't you
C	yeah you could do that
D	they're really good
C	that's not half as satisfying though is it?
A	I don't know if you've got some beastly speakers you'd hit it and it would be like
C	just need to build one of those chambers what are they called? when they're like sound-proof it's a something chamber do you know what I mean? have you ever seen those? they've got like you should google it I need to find the word they're like completely echo-free chambers there's no reverberation they've built they're completely sound-proof they've got all this weird like foam and stuff coming off the walls
D	mm
C	and apparently it's so sound-proof that it's really really disorientating and if you put someone in it they
D	really?
C	it's completely sound-proof and it apparently makes you feel terrible
D	so your your voice doesn't go anywhere at all?
C	yeah you it doesn't carry you can't go anywhere
A	well I think why
C	it absorbs everything
A	why it's freaky for people is cos you can hear all your own bodily functions like
C	yeah I think
A	you can hear the blood going past your ears
C	it's like completely silent
D	really?
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	it's meant to be really weird I've read a few articles about them what are they called do you know what I mean?
A	I don't know
C	it's a something chamber
D	yeah
C	mm is he any good?
D	about a couple of years now
C	him and his band but so they didn't have a band name
D	no they didn't
C	even
D	yeah
C	mum was saying he's not as with it as he used to be
D	he's not quite with it no
C	no
D	don't know what it is about him but
C	like a bit special not with
D	yeah I think so I think they're thinking he might have needs like special tuition or whatever
C	yeah
D	nice enough lad but you know he's erm
C	yeah
D	so whether that's got
C	does
D	I don't think so I don't think so but
C	yeah
D	and then
C	it's a bit strange isn't it?
D	yeah
C	he definitely seemed a little simpler when he came over practising through and
D	but he's a nice lad
C	he had big bruises under his eye I don't know
D	I saw that yeah I just spoke to
C	what did he say?
D	ask what had what had happened
C	he said face paint he was trying to wash face paint off in the bath or something
D	oh yeah he was covered in face paint the other day when he came back
C	yeah
D	dunno where he's been but yeah he came I dunno what day it was
C	that's some extreme like washing
D	was that Thursday Friday?
C	kids bruise though
D	yeah they
C	they bruise easier don't they
D	I suppose if he's trying to get it off and it's
C	yeah really like rubbing the crap out of it I don't know about you but I like never bruise never do you ever bruise?
A	not that easily
C	no you flick
A	that's crazy
D	yeah your mum bruises quite easily
C	yeah oh it's her foot she was in agony when she came back from
D	yeah it's ah well it's been since we was down in Devon so it's that's probably three weeks now
C	there's nothing she can do?
D	well I think she may well have chipped a bone I mean it sounded real quite a nasty I didn't actually see her fall
C	I think she's got to big graze up her knee and
D	but it's but it was quite a
C	oh bless
D	yeah looked quite a nasty fall and yeah she felt she was a lot of agony so and she hit hit her knee quite hard as well it was sort of badly cut
C	you get more brittle as you get older you know
D	well it was that as well yeah
C	once you get to like sixty-seventy it's like you fall over and you break something
D	yeah
C	tends to be she has to be careful I think was it the steps coming down to
D	it was you know where erm
C	those really steep ones kind of through the bushes
D	yeah if you go out past the little café at
C	the opposite end of the break water
D	yeah
C	is that right that's the
D	yeah so the
C	so where you come down that steep bit and then you walk along the beach
D	yeah
C	through the
D	and then you go past the erm
C	and those stairs yeah
D	the RNLI bit
C	yes yeah
D	and then
C	the lifeboat
D	yeah the lifeboat thing and then it was right past the caff I don't know what it's called now and then there's some bigs there was there there must have been like a foot a foot and a half
C	oh I know where you mean
D	and there's four of them
C	yeah okay
D	and then if you
C	the super steep one?
D	yeah really really steep yeah so it was there
C	oh god
A	was she bleeding?
D	all her legs folded under yeah
C	yeah
D	yeah and I put some salt water on it thinking that would be a good idea but I'm not too sure it was
C	no
D	it sort of got I think it whether it got infected anyway I don't know but yeah it sort of went a bit
C	well you'd think salt water would like
D	I would have thought it would have been really good for it
C	yeah it's
D	so I was putting that on it but erm yeah she was in a bad a bad way
C	I guess there might have been like other bacteria in there
D	yeah but that's not as I say it's been three weeks
C	yeah could be anything else other than a broken or chipped toe? it's nothing to do with her tendons or anything like that? it's cos she was complaining of if this was her toe she was it was hurting her up here it seemed to be earlier
D	mm
C	which is quite a way away from the it's her big toe that she thinks she's broken
D	mm I don't know
C	problem is she can't stay off of it can she?
D	no
C	you can't just like rest up your leg for a few weeks
D	but no matter it's it's still going to take her probably six weeks
C	yeah
D	if it's a little fracture or a little break or even tendons and stuff like that it's still gonna take take a minimum of six weeks
C	yeah
D	so
C	she hasn't got it scanned or anything with it?
D	no no she hasn't done that
C	you ever broken anything?
D	erm no
C	oh
D	no I never have
C	I broke my wrist when I was a kid my dad was convinced I was just being a cry baby
C	told my mum not to take me to the hospital I came back all proud with a
C	plaster cast and
D	I've had my leg sawn off
C	sawn off?
D	yeah put a new hip in
C	oh yeah of course you have
C	yeah bloody hell it's
D	not like a breakage or anything but I've had my leg sawn off
C	pretty pretty extreme yeah
C	oh god I hope they don't do that while you're awake
D	well I woke up I wasn't knocked out he said he said you've got three options you can have erm the the full erm knock out or you can have erm erm what did he call it? so you're awake but you're you're sedated
C	local?
D	yeah there's like a
C	there's general anaesthetic and local anaesthetic
D	the general which knocks you out totally then you can one where it's it's local but you're sedated or you can just have the local
C	okay
D	so I didn't just fancy having the local and being totally aware of what was going on
C	no
D	yeah
C	the crunch sound
D	and I didn't really fancy going for the
C	completely under
D	full general because apparently the recovery rate is is quite slow
C	yeah
D	and so I went I said I'll go for the go for the middle one so I had my earphones on and I could I was sedated you could but and I sort of nodded off a little bit but then I woke up and erm
C	took out your headphones and
D	put put my head up
C	blood flying everywhere
D	and like yeah the one of the doctors come round and goes are you alright? I goes yeah yeah I'm fine and I can could hear this like whacking
D	you know like it it well I didn't feel it as such you can sort of feel it through your body but
C	just didn't move
D	you didn't feel it on yeah you could feel the motion you didn't actually feel it in your hip but it actually sounded like somebody was knocking like a a stake into the ground a metal stake into the ground
D	with like a a fourteen pound lump hammer
C	oh that's my hip
D	yeah and at the time you're sort of like yeah that must have been my hip
C	yeah
D	and then the next day you think Jesus that was quite a scary thing
C	yeah yeah
D	yeah they must have been going at it
C	yeah
D	they really must have been giving it some welly
C	how much of it's been replaced then? I don't fully understand that
D	well they they've cut
C	cos your hip's are like a hole like
D	the the
C	oh bloody hell
D	so they've cut me from there so I'd imagine they've cut this part of my femur
C	yeah
D	and then and then they've put they've obviously taken out the old one but
C	this is all just like plastic
D	yeah so I think the the part of er probably about four or five inches of the femur they they've taken off and then taken out the ball joint and then they've screwed in erm a a titanium erm
C	do you go off in the scans then?
D	part of the femur yeah
C	yeah
D	I probably would yeah I've got to carry a card with me
C	do you have to take like a certificate or something yeah
D	yeah
C	to prove it
D	and then they put like a new sleeve inside your hip joint and then just whack it all together
C	but it works now
D	yeah it's beautiful good
C	you might have to get it done again the same hip
D	well they reckon it lasts about fifteen years so
C	yeah? just got to live longer than that and if you live to sixty-five
D	well
C	that's a good
D	I don't mind having it done again
C	no
D	it wasn't that bad it's probably well the first
C	as you said you were in agony before that weren't you so it's good to be out
D	yeah I couldn't walk more than probably more than five ten minutes
C	yeah mum was saying you
D	I used to lay on the sofa and I used to go I used to find relief if I put my right leg up on the top of the the sofa I mean just sort of laid there and watched the telly but it had been up there for like about fifteen minutes it used to lock into place
C	oh god
D	and the oh you'd have to try and get it down again oh Jesus it was so so painful
C	and now it's going the way the that way with the other one
D	yeah it's it's starting to with with the golf today
C	I take it it's nowhere near what the other one was?
D	no no not not even close just a little bit painful but it's I've certainly started to notice it it's it's starting to go a little bit
C	does it have a few more years? what is it you're talking about?
D	I hope well I don't think it'll last five years like the other one did
C	yeah
D	I was diagnosed like five years ago and that's pretty much to the day to be honest
C	yeah
D	the doctor sort of said well in five years you're not going to be able to walk more than sort of five ten minutes and that's pretty much true
C	yeah five years later yeah
D	yeah
C	good one
D	and it's but it took a lot of persuading for them the doctors he said you're too young you're too young they're not going to do it it's too you're too young and I sort of
C	what were they just going to tell you just to hobble around?
D	yeah yeah pretty much yeah he said you
D	and that that I had to go back to the surgeon about three or four times before I sort of convinced him to say please I need to get it done
C	good old NHS hey?
D	yeah yeah
C	don't want you to actually do these things
D	yeah so
C	yeah
D	say look I've got a a lad I want to play football I want to
C	yeah you have a child
D	you know quality of life I like cycling I like playing this that and the other
C	so you've got to plead your case why you need it
D	yeah pretty much yeah and eventually he agreed
C	they're just turning around at first and saying no it's cosmetic you don't really need that it's not covered under the NHS
C	it's cosmetic it's terrible
D	so it was tough you know but
C	behind you
C	for now you may have to have a couple more
D	well yeah I think I think this one's gonna a couple of years
C	you'll be a pro on that
D	yeah
C	want any advice about getting your hip done go to
D	maybe yeah maybe
C	my hip's been bothering me obviously nothing to the same kind of extent but you know I'm only twenty something so
D	well when first saw
C	outdoor doesn't help you know
D	when I first saw the surgeon he said this probably started in your twenties
C	yeah so
D	well I I was getting a lot of pain in my knees
C	yeah
D	and I kept going to the doctors and with pain in my knees and then I was getting acupuncture and x-rays and all this sort of stuff and they go there's nothing wrong with your knees there's nothing wrong with your knees whatsoever
C	it's not your knees
D	and what it is was my hip and because my hip was slightly out of kilter I suppose then you're putting
C	it's in your leg
D	slightly different pressure on your knees yeah
C	knees are not so much of a problem in mine I don't know what it is at first I thought it was like sciatica or something you can get like but it's always this leg nothing else and it's like a pain sometimes now actually to tell you honestly the pain kind of changes a bit but it kind of is in different positions on my leg
D	mm
C	but it's always the same leg
D	oh right
C	but the general one is the hip and it just aches and hurts and if I like if I put my leg over my other leg and kind of pull like up it kind of relieves it quite a bit do you know what I mean?
D	really? like putting like your over the top of your knee?
C	yeah like there
D	oh okay yeah
C	and that like really relieves it here
D	yeah
C	I can kind of sit there if I drink a lot the next day my hip hurts guaranteed but then so does my wrist as well for some reason
D	really?
C	yeah I get like achy joints or something you ever had that?
D	I get
C	I'm sure she gets stuff as well
D	I don't notice it any more when I when I drink
C	I don't know if this is cos I broke my wrist when I was younger but this one's fine no problem doesn't hurt but this one can really ache when I'm like quite hung over not like just you know a bit of a hangover but like we've caned a couple of like two or three bottles of whisky between a few of us and then it like hurts and my hip pretty much all day after that will like hurt
D	dunno
C	but I mean it is to the point now where it's like twice a week maybe three times a week my leg really quite hurts
D	well that's quite a lot isn't it?
C	yeah especially after I go running it's really bad after I run
D	mm
C	that'll stretch me out and then that can set it off and my leg kind of really aches I don't know what it is at the minute
D	yeah I went to yoga with with
C	mm
C	no
D	are
C	yeah
D	so I only went like three or four times
C	you're not very flexible
D	no I wasn't ever flexible before but
C	no I'm not I think actually the my least flexible part is my waist and like my hips I've got like long old arms that can stretch down there but I just can't bend in the waist
D	mm
C	like everyone's doing you know I don't
D	do you not touch your toes or anything like that?
C	no not really
D	no I haven't been able to either
C	no erm with a bit of practice I was getting there I could like maybe but not really
D	no if I had my sort of legs erm apart
C	really far apart
D	that's good yeah
C	yeah but you can touch
D	but if I put them together no I can't even get close
C	no no I can do it with my legs apart I can do it but not you know when my legs are together I struggle I I if I bend my knees slightly I can but and and I'm I'm talking tips there when my legs are apart I can put my hands flat on the ground so but that's a good bit of work I like yoga though it's good but
D	yeah and all the feeling about it it's sort of the relaxation part of it and you just do as much as you possibly can which is what the the erm instructor was sort of saying to to us just just try and stretch as must as much as you possibly can
C	yeah
D	and then to do all that and then do all the lying back and then all the music and the relaxation yeah it's good
C	feels a bit compromising the first kind of couple of times
D	yeah it was yeah
D	it was really nice
C	but no I like it
D	mm
C	twenty seconds is enough for me or it so we just kind of speed it up a little bit
D	mm
C	I just get a bit bored I like doing it once a week all that kind of thing sometimes my shoulder hurts as well and again just never this shoulder always this shoulder and I remember this when I used to do cross-country a lot when I was a
D	you
C	I don't know if you heard that
D	I could hear it actually yeah
C	yeah it's proper popping and grating as it go down
D	yeah
C	my hip does it too my hip pops and grates
D	yeah
C	this one doesn't this one doesn't so I don't know if I've like fallen on or something
D	it's something on that side isn't it?
C	I know I definitely fell when I was hiking once I I slipped and I landed oh that just really popped
E	have you had enough there?
C	you old fogey you old fogey you
D	I was
C	yeah I'm gonna clean up I just we were just chatting
E	yeah that that's nice don't like rushing as soon as you've eaten where's
C	yeah

C	yeah
D	but it's the I think it's the brothers that did The Matrix
C	oh cool
D	Cohen brothers is it?
C	yeah yeah
D	yeah
C	you've got it all downloaded?
D	yeah I've got the whole lot yeah
C	oh I'll grab it I think yeah how many seasons is it?

C	oh that's all they're gonna do?
D	yeah
C	oh tragic
D	very very good but it they say it's based on a true story but I'm not too sure it was
C	no yeah

C	Archer's quite good don't know if you've heard of that
D	Archer?
C	it's a cartoon
D	no
C	it's an adult cartoon it's like I don't know how to describe it it's like a James Bond style character but he's a bit of a womaniser and like it's a cartoon but it's done quite strangely
D	no I've not never heard of it
C	it's very sexual like the whole programme is
D	oh is it?
C	it is yeah it's a bit odd they're like it's good though it's it's really short it's only like twenty minute cartoon style episodes but very much for adults it's on Adult Swim in thing
D	oh right
C	but he's like he's effectively like a spun like a James Bond but an American one I guess it's good again if we can trade I've got a whole bunch of stuff I want to watch
D	yeah definitely yeah
C	and I'll
D	there's another film called This is the End
C	This is the End?
D	yeah it's pretty funny about the the apocalypse but it's all with people playing their own characters oh Jonah Hill erm well what are your characters in This is the End?

D	you're alright I'll get
E	no I've got other ones for this there's four bits in there is that not enough?
C	it's a bit weird it starts it's they use a lot of weird sound effects in it and it starts with like a black and white movie of a tree and
D	oh god really?
C	the parents just like being hung there and the whole thing is about in the family the same thing happens to these different families one child will disappear and then the rest of the family get murdered like horrifically and it all gets caught on camera erm and you find out
E	I might watch it
D	well we we've had it for like probably a year and a half now so
C	yeah
E	yeah
C	you find out it's the child it's the child

C	it's the child doing the the child that goes missing being possessed by this like demon thing and like
E	oh god I hate stuff like that
C	goes in and like does it there's this nasty where they're all like tied to a there's a film when they're in a pool there's like all of them are on sunbathing loungers and you see them just getting pulled into the water just like one by one it's weird it's like it's creepy because of like the sounds and the I can't explain there's another one where the kid's got a lawn mower and he's going around the the pet adults are on the ground and he's just like goes over their faces with the lawn mower
E	oh
D	oh
C	so they're all like mashed up it's not gory it's not it's just the sounds and the creepiness

E	more ice please waiter
C	I'll have two tubes do you have yours chilled or not?

C	yeah better to cut them it's easier
E	is it dried out?
D	yeah
C	you haven't been good at biting it off

E	and then we had a pow-wow didn't we
D	yeah yeah yeah
E	after one of the gigs we finished at two and then sat there chatting it all through to like three didn't we in the morning
D	yeah so it so that Thursday we went round and me and
E	oh yeah
D	and then she came out with a spreadsheet about she said disregarding the money we've just paid into the van erm we've got this much deposits we've got to pay out this much between now and the end of the year we've got this money coming in so the money in the bank at the moment is twenty-two quid each so I said what are you saying? is that how much money I'm going to be getting back then twenty-two quid? and she goes well no I goes well what are you doing what's what's that about then? and she goes I'm just telling you that's the we agreed that if you were to leave the the band the the money left in the band
C	yeah
E	they didn't even mention the van money did they?
D	yeah the that was that was totally disregarded
E	there should have been an extra four grand in there
C	I mean that's quite a few gigs worth of
E	mm
C	gigs isn't it?
D	twenty-two quid yeah so I just said oh that's an insult
C	so have you fallen out with them over this?
D	well
E	no not really
D	a little bit a little bit
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker D got insulted by his/her friends	Neutral
E	you do feel that you've been had
D	I still think I've I've been done over yeah
E	I think
C	sure yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker D feels like he worked more than expected	Neutral
E	but because we're all mates it's it's hard and they sat there kind of putting all this like business plan together didn't they and
D	yeah but they've got to
E	yeah yeah
D	they knew that
E	yeah I mean
D	and then it was three against two and there was always going to be like so the the democracy or whatever and it's the
E	mm
[ANNOTATION]	They had a business plan to make a new cafeteria	Neutral
D	the majority rules and all this sort of stuff
E	they wouldn't have it that it was a business and that it you know it should be one fifth to everybody whoever leaves kind of thing buys them out it's all about you know there isn't any profit and it's all gone back into the into the band for equipment and van and everything else
C	so it's all just for fun
E	but yeah and they said oh well you get paid as a a you know a decent wage out of it didn't you
C	you've lit the wrong end
A	oh you're kidding me
C	no you lit the wrong end
A	that's the it's the
C	this
D	yeah it's
A	yeah
D	the sort of torpedo end in your
[ANNOTATION]	They're getting the minimum possible wage	Neutral
A	yeah
D	that you suck from
A	oh no way
C	I'm sure it was
E	does it matter?
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker E is wondering if it plays a role	Entailment
C	probably not
D	well I doubt it but
E	can you not cut that off and start again or what?
A	well now it doesn't have the aroma
D	you'd just be laughed out of the gentlemen's club
C	I guess just cos it kind of no there's not much difference on the end er no yeah it does get slightly bigger you've just got the biggest end of it there
A	well it's all made of the same thing isn't it
C	yeah
A	so I don't see how it makes a difference
C	it's fine
E	I guess it's just like putting a cigarette in the wrong end or you get like a
D	yeah but you're lighting the filter innit?
A	bit worse than that though yeah
A	yeah smoking the filter
C	no I don't think that's on I don't think you joined the band just for a non-profit
A	when I looked when I looked at your ones cos you've had it in your mouth that's kind of put a shape there anyway
C	yeah
E	mm
A	so I I looked and I was like well
E	going to have to open the window a little bit
C	yeah do I'm sure we'll still be able to smell it
D	yeah so it was only me and
A	backed you up on it
D	erm yeah so we well I we he came out with a figure of a thousand pound and I said well that's pretty much what I was thinking
C	oh right
D	I've invested more than that in the band
C	yeah
D	in the last four years
C	well it's much more than that
D	much more than that
C	mm
E	there's water in the jug
C	you've got Ipads and everything
D	yeah exactly
C	and vans and whatnot
D	and lasers and smoke machines and bloody
E	I mean it's true what they
D	it is a joke
E	I know I know it's and after we'd kind of talked it through they were saying well we all need to make it fair for everybody else so if we're going to do that then you could have a thousand pounds out when you when you leave then we all need to put every band member needs to put six hundred or something
D	between now and new year
E	between now and new year and we
D	I'd have to put six hundred in to get four hundred well to get a thousand out
E	and I said so I said so
C	yeah but you've already put that money in
E	yeah
D	yeah so
E	I know
D	yeah
E	but they were like you know it has to be fair because if someone else leaves in two months
C	alright well ask to sell some of the equipment
E	mm I know
C	I mean it's it's a fifth yours so
D	yeah well that's the way I saw it
E	but it was decided in the end that you'd get three hundred and
D	I I er eventually they
D	and it was three against two it was me and
E	mm
D	so I said okay I I told you
C	how did they get a four five grand van for?
D	well we always give twenty-five percent of our money into running the band
E	and they're saying that twenty-five percent isn't your money it's what you allocate back into the band
D	but even
E	but it is your money
D	it is it still is your money and
E	yeah
D	last year we went to
E	yeah yeah we've had some good times out of it as well
D	the year before we went to we went to Spain and all this sort of stuff so it's not just the running of the band with insurances and stuff
E	mm
D	it's er still a lot of money
E	mm
D	and if you
C	mm
D	in that band
E	mm
D	that wouldn't go to the running of the band
D	and eventually there's there's
A	I know
D	lots of profit there lots and lots of profit
A	oh well
D	but there you go
C	I do now
unknown_female	that's a bit shit
C	I guess that eventuality perhaps needed to have been discussed years ago
E	yeah yeah we said that didn't we?
D	yeah I
unknown_female	mm
E	but when you start off as a band it's all a bit of fun and kind of like you say you don't think you're gonna go that far
C	you're not
D	and we were we were
C	you're not thinking about leaving are you
D	we were doing pubs for
E	no
D	for a hundred quid
C	yeah
D	and a hundred and fifty quid and and two hundred and fifty quid there was it was
E	no one no one saw that it was gonna go anywhere then
C	wasn't
D	at at that time we sort of said you know okay if someone wants to leave the band we've got no equipment or whatever then you just
E	yeah
D	you just walk away but
E	mm
D	we've built up a lot since then
unknown_female	yeah
D	we're doing corporate gigs we're going weddings and
E	mm
C	no it's not on
D	that's a lot of money a lot of money
E	mm mm so now we're just kind of
D	I've certainly invested more than twenty-two quid into the band in the last bloody
E	oh
D	if you're a stakeholder or a shareholder in a company and you want to be bought out of that company
unknown_female	yeah
D	you don't just sort of leave what's ever in the bank do you?
C	no
D	they buy you out
C	yeah
D	they buy out your investment
E	and they said they could see that
C	cos I mean somebody else is gonna be coming in with all this equipment
D	yeah yeah exactly
E	mm the only
D	but it comes back to last man standing if I was to leave then
E	mm
D	and
E	mm
C	then the last person's laughing
D	but yeah
C	and got everything
D	cos they've they've got all that gear
E	mm
D	all that equipment all the money in the bank
C	yeah no that's not on at all
D	and that's gonna be that's gonna be
C	yeah
D	even though they they they said that wasn't gonna be
E	I mean they've put a lot of no
D	they said that wasn't gonna be the case but
E	mm
D	I was sort of saying well it will be
E	mm
D	I'm gonna leave the
E	mm
D	next person's gonna leave is gonna be
E	mm I mean they have put a lot of extra work into it
C	what would you do?
A	I'd definitely want a fifth of that stuff but
E	mm
D	yeah
C	I'd argue for selling it
C	I'd say let's sell it now then a fifth of it's mine I've put the money in
E	mm but there's no contract or anything so and it all ended with kind of like we'll go with that and it was kind of a group hug and you just move on kind of thing
C	just have to take
E	it's not worth falling out with friends and stuff
C	what are you doing?
D	that's the trouble ain't it with having a business with your friends cos
C	yeah
E	yeah
D	you do get
E	I know my dad he went in business with a with a friend and it was the worst thing he ever did
D	well that's fairly common isn't it?
E	mm
C	well
A	this is
D	you're having a bit of trouble up there aren't you?
C	it's it's coming apart
A	yeah well I lit the wrong end
E	I'd just share your brother if I was you
D	that's all cos you're yeah I guess it's cos it's wrapped in a certain way where it
E	mm
D	it it burns the the right end first doesn't it?
E	mm
A	yeah
D	you're burning the wrong end first then it's gonna come unwrapped
A	so that's why you shouldn't have done it like that
E	you'll have to share yours
D	only you
A	no it's alright don't really inhale it anyway
D	this one's smoking nicely for half an hour
D	tell you what you could do
C	empty it out fill it with wind
C	reseal it with some honey
A	it's gonna get stuck in my mouth now
D	cos it's still burning ain't it?
A	yeah
D	that's not gonna be er
C	it's not gonna work
D	it's not gonna work is it?
A	is it still burning?
C	somebody gave me a cigar a few months ago came round to like a party that we were having well it was outside
C	er it had like yellow white fluffy mould on the
E	oh
C	I smoked it anyway and the guy
D	oh
E	did you?
C	yeah
C	so I was like alright but erm then erm another guy he gave one to another guy and
D	this ain't gonna work out nah
C	like I got him to bite it off for me cos I was like I'm not very good at this and we told the other guy you've gotta bite it off he bit off like
C	completely shredded at one end and it was so
D	look so cool in westerns don't they?
C	there's actually some skill to it
C	for his wedding
E	oh yeah
D	it was in a tube as well weren't it?
E	yeah
D	was it in a tube?
C	yeah
E	it was so cool
C	that was a big old cigar
E	yeah
C	supposedly
D	it was a nice cigar
C	supposedly a Cuban I mean I was pretty close to Cuba so could've been a Cuban
E	oh it was a nice touch
D	they're not allowed to take them are they from Cuba into America?
C	no
D	but you can go take them from Cuba anywhere else but er
C	yeah so Mexico you can get them in alright
D	yeah
C	yeah they've they erm put an embargo on Cuba so they can't take goods from there
E	mm
C	bastards the Americans aren't they?
D	mm
D	it's strong though
C	tired I mean it's only about seven o'clock isn't it?
unknown_female	mm
E	it's about eight
C	should really put some more cream on that
E	is it eight?
D	I dunno I've just looked at my watch but I've just noticed
C	noticed my rash
D	my rash
C	how was your run
A	yeah it was good
C	yeah?
D	did you go for a run?
C	how far did you go?
A	oh it was just around stuff
C	did you go round the block?
A	the
C	yeah
E	spinney
A	yeah not the spinney
D	that's quite a nice walk up there actually
A	down by the church
E	oh yeah yeah
D	past the river
E	and round did you go?
unknown_female	yeah
unknown_female	yeah
E	I used to like doing that run
D	that's quite nice yeah that's where I used to go
unknown_female	jog along
E	do you want another?
D	yes please
E	mm I can feel that hitting the back of my throat that cigar
C	I used to do quite a good run in erm Mokpo it was around erm kind of like around the base of a mountain so like
E	mm
C	it was
E	and then you come down
C	down the other side yeah
E	oh excellent
C	erm I always did it twice around but one time I did it it was fucking hot it was summer and I did it like three times it was like twelve K and that third K or that third time around I thought I was gonna die that er last time
E	mm oh no
D	yeah
C	so I got really really hot I was just like kind of dizzy when I finished and it's still like a twenty minute walk back to my house after that
E	oh no
C	so it was a bit like
E	sounds little bit too far that one
C	I think it was more the hill like I can run twelve K and it's fine but it was like up and down a mountain pretty much
E	yeah
C	I don't think it was too high but it was like three hundred metres of elevation and
E	it's such a lovely feeling running
D	oh I miss running so much
C	yeah
E	mm
C	I like it too my hip does not
E	yeah
A	it's not easy running long distance
C	no
E	I just find I just get a stitch like I don't get tired I just get a stitch
C	run
E	mm
D	yeah
C	you've gotta run past the stitch
A	sometimes it hurts so much
C	yeah you've got to run past it
E	mm just hold it
C	get a second wind
D	it'll go and then never used to get stitches luckily but
C	yeah
D	apparently they do go
C	yeah no they do
D	keep running through it yeah
C	I used to do a lot of cross-country didn't I?
E	mm yeah
C	I ran for the county and stuff
E	mm
C	but I came second in my school in year eight or something I can't remember  the last year of middle school
E	mm
C	coming out with mud half up to your ankles and stuff
unknown_female	mm
C	doesn't make it particularly easy
E	I used to like running at school
C	I ran by the river in
E	you might be able to run to the sea
C	that was our plan you can run along the sea quite far
E	mm mm
C	there's no sand
A	no sand? just rocks?
C	no it's just just pebbles but you wouldn't run on the actual beach
E	no just on the promenade bit
C	like run on the run on the promenade
D	yeah get your view
C	it goes all the way down go to
E	is there?
C	yeah just round the corner from there I didn't know that
A	mm
C	a place called
E	oh I've heard of
C	yeah?
E	mm
E	I didn't realise Kent was such a large area
C	it's a big old county
E	yeah
C	I think one of one of the biggest in in
D	yeah
E	I was talking to
C	yeah
E	or
E	you know what I'm like
C	yeah it is quite big yeah
unknown_female	it's a big old county
E	so how far is
C	erm
E	in time
A	pardon me
E	squeaky chair
C	about an hour an hour's drive
A	yeah it's a good hour I would've thought
C	maybe a little bit more
E	mm
D	it's mainly motorway ain't it I think you can drop down into the M27 or something
C	yeah
D	just drops down into
E	I would imagine you'd be able to get a train from Kent to
C	it's certainly more useful that we're both in the that corner of the country
E	yeah
A	it'll be cool
D	I cycled
C	oh nice
A	if you went to
C	through the South Downs
unknown_female	yeah I know I wanted to go to
E	I always wanted to go to Scotland though
D	that's quite hilly
C	yeah South Downs?
D	yeah
C	yeah erm my friend
D	yeah
C	we'll go off round there
D	did
E	well you do need a helmet though
E	we don't have a helmet do we helmet do we?
D	yeah
E	don't have a spare helmet
C	it's about it's about as hilly as it gets I think
D	yeah
E	we have got a spare one?
D	we've got a spare one yeah
C	oh you do have one? is it a legality do you have to wear a helmet these days?
D	no
E	well if you're going mountain biking you need one
D	yeah but you don't have to I mean it's
C	I mean if you've got one then yeah I'll take that and a lock if you've got one
E	I've packed them
D	just going to sort out going to try and sort out
C	I need to learn how to use my hands although I'm terrible with stuff like
E	on a bike?
C	I'm terrible with all that kind of stuff
E	google it
C	dad's never taught me I've never had the interest
E	mm
C	I just like if it works it works
D	well they're not too difficult to work on to be honest
C	I don't think it is but
D	just keep keep the oil lubricated and the breaks and WD-40 and all that sort of stuff
C	yeah
D	different oils on the different things but they're not that difficult to work on really
C	I just don't
E	well every time we come down we'll bring the cleaning kit
C	I need to be better with that first
E	and then
C	yeah
D	I might have a spare maintenance book if you want it
C	yeah
D	if you're interested in it
C	yeah I need to learn all that kind of stuff you know it would be nice to be able to you know do a bit of carpentry or something like do something with my hands cos I mean
E	mm
C	like you said
A	well you do play an instrument
C	yeah playing the guitar but that's about it and even then I wasn't very good and taking those things apart
E	mm
C	might give it a try I'll do what you did I'm pretty sure I did lock the bridge and I was just but I want a floating bridge so I bought a guitar with a floating bridge and I hardly use the floating bridge
D	yeah it's just cos I was buying it when er we first started up the band
C	yeah yeah
D	and I couldn't couldn't tune it for the life of me so
C	it it was doing my head in
D	yeah just at the back and we just lopped it all off so
C	yeah I did the same I was just disappointed that I couldn't
E	mm
C	couldn't use it for what it was for
D	like a dive
C	yeah
D	it's not for me
C	I'm no good with my hands
D	just rhythm guitar so
C	I can put a tent up pretty quick but
C	yeah
D	got new talents
A	you can roll cigarettes pretty well
C	mm
A	that's a skill again
E	I mean you grew up with your dad with building and made
D	well he was a carpenter wasn't he?
E	yeah exactly so you had all that influence didn't you?
D	and his
E	yeah where did you get your music from then?
D	erm I don't know really
E	yeah he was into music wasn't he?
C	where do we get ours from?
D	yeah I think it was something
E	my mum enjoys music
D	you just loved listening to
E	yeah
D	so if you love listening to music then
E	yeah always been music around
D	perhaps wanna play an instrument
A	you guys
E	and I can remember sitting in the bedroom listening to you
C	I've got so much music to show you
D	I want to start writing some songs as well and stuff I've got loads of sort of half-finished songs that I
C	yeah I do
E	mm
D	I really wanna do that sounded like someone was coming in then
E	it did
E	yeah
C	my erm music collection's up to about five hundred and something bands now
E	what kind of music do you like now?
C	everything
E	do you have a favourite at the moment?
C	yeah
E	does there have like one kind of
C	my roots are still in like experimental metal or that's probably still my roots so
A	I'd totally forgotten that we're still recording
C	yeah
A	how long are we up to?
C	it's been an hour and twenty minutes
A	that's pretty good
C	yeah
A	are we getting a cup?
C	you've got my company
A	yeah
C	I'm gracing you with my presence
A	oh yeah
E	you've got to speak more
C	yeah you're not saying anything if we were paying paying by words then you
C	you've said about three words
E	this is really getting to be
C	yeah I should put it out
E	no no no don't worry
C	save this for another day
D	door's open it's alright innit?
E	yeah
D	well
C	sit outside on the nice summer's evening
E	smoking
C	I missed the good weather then did I?
D	yeah you did
E	I was trying to make my foot out of the way of you and then you scooted your foot back
A	about a week two went or a week and a half
C	yeah there was a lot of flooding as well wasn't there about this year last year? there's been a lot of flooding at some point
E	no that was last year wasn't it? or was it this year? no it's not been this year has it? it was last summer
D	it's been fairly settled in this year
E	yeah
D	had the er odd day haven't we but
E	yeah we haven't had the flooding
D	fairly settled
C	yeah mum was talking about hailstones the size of golf balls the other day
E	it was
D	I didn't see that I didn't see that
C	that's fairly settled for England
E	and we were saying about the
D	it's been a nice summer has been a nice summer
E	it has it really has but we were saying also that well no that's not quite true because we did have a good few weeks that were constant temperatures didn't we
D	yeah probably at least six weeks I would've thought
E	of constant weather and then when it start
C	oh nice
E	when wasn't it to do with that hurricane or something or
D	pretty much all another way
E	that changed it?
C	er the erm
D	Bertie or
E	Bertie
D	Bertie
D	what was that? you said about the the hurricane Lee wasn't it?
E	yeah when we went camping
D	when we went camping last weekend yeah we got the tail end of some hurricane then
E	was it last weekend we were camping?
D	yeah
C	did I ever tell you about the I've probably missed out a bunch of stories that I haven't told you the erm maybe I have told the two hurricanes that I had to walk through when I first went back to Korea
E	I remember speaking to you via email or or something
C	it was horrible I came this close to walking when I got back I had a bit of like reverse shock from like travelling for a year
E	yeah
C	and not working and like went into my job and I had to work at two different schools and the first week I just worked at one school and we had they call them typhoons they're not hurricanes but it's the same thing it just depends where in the world it is or it's a typhoon over in Asia
D	is that right?
C	yeah typhoons are
D	I thought hurricanes were
C	no exactly the same yeah apparently I looked it up and I thought well erm typhoons are over in er Asia like that kind of area and then hurricanes are I think it's like Pacific and Atlantic but I'm not sure
D	oh okay
C	yeah erm
D	mm
C	and like loads of these church steeples cos there's loads of churches everywhere just like had fallen off and everything made me walk through this bloody thing I get to the school it's insane there's like no-one there and palm trees are like going crazy like outside the building and just like got to like mop up the floor or some crap I didn't I didn't really do anything and then they tell me oh yes there's no lunch so you're going to have to walk back home through it again to then walk back through it again to then walk home through it again so I had to walk through the damn thing about four times and it's like a twenty minute walk to home so I
E	that's ridiculous
C	bit dangerous so I was already a bit annoyed about that and then the net week I had the first day of my new school on a Thursday I didn't know exactly where the school was but it was fine I was going to tell a taxi and I knew enough Korean to kind of get there but there was another typhoon Typhoon Tembin hit the exact day of my new school and I was all suited and booted and like couldn't get in a taxi
C	no just go and sit in your office you've got a two-and-a-half hour teachers' workshop to plan to you're going to be doing that this afternoon and I sat in there just like it was pathetic fallacy with the rain the wind and everything and I've got to plan this stupid teachers' workshop
C	I'd just been travelling for this is terrible I came very close to just being like screw it I'm just I don't wanna do it I don't wanna I felt really like stressed
E	I remember you were saying
C	so obviously got
E	but
C	and it didn't have any the next year or this year so it was quite bad that year
E	yeah but you you've got through it you stuck it
C	yeah
A	it was never the bad that like people died but it was a big
C	no yeah not many people but people die
A	mm just from like falling things
C	yeah old people usually
A	yeah
C	not many people die
A	yeah it's not like a hurricane where it comes over land and people get pulled out and
C	no
A	maybe I've watched too many films
C	I mean it is
E	it is a tornado
D	it's a tornado
C	yeah
D	yeah
C	it is a hurricane a typhoon is a hurricane
E	mm
C	there's no difference
E	but like
C	but I don't know if America gets bigger ones than this they tend to hit Japan a lot and the Philippines a lot the Philippines gets hit by some pretty big ones every year it just tears through them
E	scary
C	Japan gets hit by everything it's ridiculous Korea is just like completely safe you see the we watched them cos they've got like a weather report and you see the typhoons coming in and they track them pretty much always they're like gonna hit Korea and then at the last minute they veer right and like just go straight over Japan or pretty much eight out of ten typhoons end up not actually hitting Korea
E	oh my gosh
C	and just going straight through
D	in American they
C	yeah they do yeah
D	with the but they start from the beginning of the alphabet
C	yeah it's the beginning of the alphabet
D	but it's and is it female then male female male or is it
C	yeah something like that
D	all females in the next season something like that it's like
C	are they just all females?
D	no I think they they alternate it
C	yeah they do
D	but whether they alternate it in the same year or if the next year it's going to be male
C	it's all male and then that year it's all female
D	yeah yeah something like that
C	terrible
D	so when you get up to hurricane Zelda I mean they'll have had the year
E	yeah
E	that would be very bad
C	they had that erm polar vortex did you hear about that at all? like massive it was a year ago did you hear about that? maybe two years ago
D	no
C	massive parts of the country were sub-zero temperatures like minus thirty minus forty like minus fifty in some parts even in Tennessee which is pretty far south was down to like minus twenty and like everywhere was frozen for quite a while England actually that was when we got a lot of flooding it was the same storm
E	oh
C	it was the same system
E	yeah
C	but they were being frozen the whole of America got like frozen and
E	oh yeah yeah yeah I do remember yeah
C	did you not hear about that?
E	yeah
C	and you were getting the same weather system
E	yeah I do remember
C	but it was causing it to drop the water
D	mm
C	but America was getting hit pretty hard with that as well
D	I think it gets a like a knock-on effect from like a a massive tidal wave like happened in Sri Lanka a few years ago
C	yeah
D	and it just er affects the weather system so much and it just a knock-on effect to everybody
C	I definitely notice patterns with here and in Korea like we seem to have similar weather patterns depending on the year if this year you're getting a lot of rain then we seem to be getting a lot of rain also and for another year it's quite hot and drought
E	oh yeah
C	and it seems to be like over there as well
E	yeah
D	really?
C	yeah there's definitely seems to be I don't know if that's just a bit of a coincidence
E	mm
C	but there'd definitely been some correlation between what's going on in Europe and what's going on in Asia I mean it makes sense the big old big old weather systems
E	crazy isn't it?
C	every year
D	it's like the low and the high pressure and all that sort of stuff
C	yeah and they get two monsoons and they get like one pushes from up and one pushes down but it's completely
D	it's like a base in North Wales er I think it might be
C	yeah it dumps it just off the mountain yeah
D	yeah so it's all comes under high pressure and it's really nice this side and it it goes over the mountain and you get the the low
C	yeah dumps it
D	it just dumps on the the other side of the mountain
C	it has that in erm to a bigger degree in Latin America
E	thinking of making a tea
A	well
C	running down the entire coast of Chile I mean the border of Chile and Argentina is just mountains like the Andes mountain chain runs all the way down and the Chile side is like part of the direst part of the world like the Atacama Desert gets like no rain whatsoever it the only in fact it hasn't rained in the Atacama Desert for thousands of years
D	yeah but I'd seen that before yeah
C	all yeah all they get is like some
D	just like crazy innit
C	right they have three very clear erm zones actually it's amazing that the Incas did what they did but if you take Peru and this is the same for all of those countries that go round Venezuela Columbia Ecuador Peru Bolivia then it changes Brazil's too big and Argentina and Chile are in a different area but all of those countries I first said have three distinct zones the coastal desert area the mountains the jungle they all have that every single country and apparently the Incas were so good at what they did that this massive area I don't know if you've ever heard of Nazca the Nazca Lines or er
D	no I haven't
C	er there's these big lines of these rocks right in the and they've got erm they drew massive pictures on it you can fly over it in planes and see these crazy things in the desert that they made
D	and you do that
C	I only ever saw it from I was looking down it's a bit
E	how?
C	irrigated the whole thing they brought water down from the mountains and the channel still exists you can still where they've brought the water down
D	that's amazing innit
C	but apparently they turned it all into fields the whole
E	mm
C	the whole the whole thing was green yeah it was insane
E	amazing
C	yeah
E	did I tell you that
C	he's from Ghana isn't he?
D	yeah
E	yeah
D	there's but part of that is in the the Amazon
C	yeah
D	and he's he's gone down there he goes out there for like well
E	months
D	three four months at a time mostly
E	yeah
D	and they're
C	looking for gold?
D	yeah
E	with his brothers and they're all tooled up with knives and guns
D	and it
E	cos it's incredibly dangerous
D	apparently it's yeah incredibly dangerous over there and
E	yeah
D	it takes them like
E	he's gone back to Indiana Jones time
D	they they fly to some places and it's it takes them like a week or something to get where they're is it irrigating or is it
C	yeah panning for I mean
D	yeah
C	are they panning for gold? what are they erm actually do
D	no I think they're doing like they've actually digging and
E	just setting up the yeah
D	er it's not just like going into the the water and all this sort of stuff
E	no they're just setting up all the drills and everything yeah
C	I take it he's finding a bit of gold out there
D	well
E	don't know yet
D	don't think they've found any yet but they've done all the research and they've bought this massive amount of land and er
C	so they own the land then?
D	yeah they own it yeah
E	they're mining it
D	yeah
C	if they need anyone to come with them
E	yeah probably
D	it sounds very interesting but he's missing for like months at a time
A	hell hole snake pit
E	yeah
A	yeah
E	it's not good for the kids really
C	snake pit
A	just a hell hole snake pit in the jungle and
C	yeah I mean I didn't spend long in the Amazon and it's hard work
E	mm
C	it's really hard work
E	mm
C	I was only in it for like four or five
E	I was talking to gramps about it are you going to give gramps a call?
C	yeah
E	oh I'll give you his number
C	I was in there for like four nights in a tent
E	mm
C	and it was like crazy when it's really crazy and when I wouldn't want to be out is at night and they were like really careful about us not wandering off like at night cos it was like very easy to spot snakes like no worries
E	mm
C	and there were some really poisonous snakes just like hanging from the trees just like waiting to like grab stuff
E	mm
C	as it like goes past loads of loads of loads and loads of shit
E	mm
C	it's the only
E	really?
C	yeah it was quite scary
E	why did she faint?
C	erm I think a multitude of reasons
D	it was very hot wasn't it?
C	yeah it was extremely hot erm we'd been above three to four thousand metres for like months we'd been just in the mountains for months
D	oh and coming down or whatever
C	so I think it was reverse erm altitude sickness effectively
D	mm
C	and we came down on the Bolivian death road I don't know if you've ever head of the death road
E	yeah I think you've mentioned it before as well
C	and the yeah and they've had and it's a terrible road and loads of people die erm and that was like a twenty hour journey on a bus
E	oh my god
C	just down from you know four thousand metres at La Paz
E	yeah
C	down to sea level in the Amazon and we like went camping down there they didn't feed us properly all day and
E	yeah
C	when when they're killing those like giant mosquito things
E	big beetle yeah
C	with the it looked like this just it looked mechanical it would oh pardon me
E	oh god
C	that was uncovered you had to tuck your trousers into your socks you know things into your
E	oh no
C	like everything was like long sleeve covered everything even the guides so it's not normal that you see the guides doing that the guides always seem to be immune to whatever affects us but even these guys were like boots jeans trousers everything you know completely covered
E	she passed out?
C	erm yeah she completely fainted and I had to like take her down to the ground and stuff
E	for how long?
C	and then she was sick after that she had like diarrhoea for like a couple of days
E	oh god
C	so that was horrible it wasn't very nice we were
E	oh my gosh she must have been really struggling
C	it was too hot to sleep I the tent as well so you're just kind of like out it was just er some you know they got the guys have got stories one one's got like big erm snake bites like on his arm and like they've seen quite a few jaguars
E	could you not have not got out of the Amazon considering she was
C	we saw a jaguar footprint so we were really close
E	did you?
C	cos I saw a wet jaguar footprint like
E	wow
C	I never actually saw the animal itself but
E	could you not have got out of there knowing that she as so ill?
C	er we could have got out yeah I guess if we'd have paid them enough money I mean we were
E	mm
C	in a group of like six of us seven of us
E	mm
C	so we'd have had to have I guess cancelled the trip for all of them so
C	but erm it was a good four five hour boat journey back to the smallest town
E	gosh
C	and yeah
E	and I bet she felt dreadful
C	yeah she was fine
E	toughie
C	bit worried
E	was that the worst she's been?
C	yeah I guess so it was the Amazon though so that's not too bad but like she fainted
E	do you ever kind of like think you know how amazing she does for for a girl and being so little
C	definitely
E	you know
C	well it's not just being a girl that's a bit sexist isn't it?
E	I know it's a bit sexist but
C	you girls can be just as hardy as us guys
E	of course they can of course they can
C	no I absolutely do that's why I cherish her
E	mm
C	she's done everything that I've done so it's
E	so have you done anything that she wants to do?
C	what's this then?
E	or
C	what do you mean?
E	or is it like whatever what you want to do she's happy with doing kind of thing does she ever kind of say right well I wanna go here and I wanna do this and you do it? or is it just kind of like discussed together and think yeah that would be cool?
C	yeah I mean we just I do more of the planning that she does not because she doesn't want to just probably because I'm just get ahead of the game so by the time she's come to look at
D	that's
E	yeah yeah yeah
C	and
D	you're quite happy for me to do it and
E	plan it and I enjoy it and go with it and
D	yeah
C	doesn't mean that you wouldn't
E	no
C	it's just that we have our roles and that's kind of what I do but I I erm and I'm sure you do like you know I try and discuss it with her and come up with agreement of what we
D	yeah
E	you just tell me don't you
C	that's pretty much
E	you just say we're doing it that's it
D	well
E	bitch
C	I do call her that
D	only cos you
C	yeah
D	what I do is I do all the planning and
E	yeah no I'm joking cos you do come back to me and you'll say right what about this are you happy with this? and you'll and we'll go through it and then I come and say well no that time doesn't kind of really work with this and that and the other and we discuss it don't we?
D	mm
C	the difficult time comes
E	and then like then we
C	when I'm travelling with someone else
E	mm
C	with
E	yeah
C	but when like if we're ever with
E	yeah yeah well you don't want to have to be thinking about other people all the time when you're travelling do you?
C	but you do
E	yeah
C	there aren't that many people I could travel with though
E	no
D	we're doing to do some walking actually aren't we?
D	we're gonna go up to the Wales and North Wales and do some walking and camping and stuff
C	rambling
D	now I can sort of get around a little bit better
E	well
D	well
D	before before before my other hip goes
C	yeah do it
D	yeah well it
C	some beautiful walking
D	oh there really is
E	mm
D	yeah
E	I wanna go to Scotland as well we'll have more time once the band's quit
D	and you get no time at all have we
C	the Highland Way or whatever it is in Scotland
E	no nothing mm
D	Scotland's a beautiful country
E	can't plan anything really can we and it's all got to be planned round the band
C	there's meant to be a lot of bugs in Scotland isn't there?
D	there is yeah and the the midges in the summer
D	you get all midges and that and they they are quite annoying
C	mm doesn't
D	but it's just a beautiful country
C	same as like Alaska I've heard that Alaska is like full of ginormous mosquitos
E	really?
C	and like midges and stuff
E	god you wouldn't think that would you?
C	no cos it's odd because in England we don't really get mosquitos and you kind of think that it's too cold or something
D	mm
E	mm
C	but no you can go colder and there's that it I don't really make any sense
D	it's just up the up like the coast?
C	pretty much where it is yeah but they follow the mountains all the way up from the Pacific Crest Trail and they get erm they get drop-offs at certain towns so they plan
E	oh my god
C	got to El Salvador and then sailed across the Pacific to New Zealand
E	Jeez
C	they sailed across the whole erm Pacific
D	crazy innit
C	it's insane yeah
E	bloody hell
C	and then they've just been chilling in New Zealand for like the last year and now they've just set off again
E	wow
C	then off
E	you've met some amazing people haven't you through your travels?
C	I've met people that have cycled across the world walked across the world and also it makes me want to do something like that
D	mm
E	mm
C	you know what I mean like
E	mm
C	I was tempted for a while to like try and kayak like could I kayak around the coast of Africa or some bullshit you know I mean like just what could you do? like everyone does
D	and the Grand Canyon
C	some crazy shit
D	that's supposed to be a bit of a
C	yeah
D	bit of a trek
C	some people have like kayaked through the Amazon and stuff I read a book about a British guy that walked the entire length of the Amazon took him two years walked from Peru to the mouth of the Amazon just sounds insane
E	mm
C	terribly terribly terribly boring though apparently like just constantly
E	I'll bet
C	day in day out chopping vines down and being bitten by mosquitos
E	oh my god
C	and wading in water like up to here and shit
E	why would you want to do it?
C	why I
E	I mean I know it's an experience and a challenge
C	to say you've you've walked the
D	yeah why not?
C	bloody Amazon
E	mm
D	it's like saying why do you you wanna climb that mountain well it's it's there
E	mm
C	it's human endeavour
D	yeah
C	and there's crazy enough people out there that wanna do this stuff
E	mm
C	there's definitely been times where
E	mm
D	on the way up pictures you send me
C	yeah on the way up
E	I was saying to
C	yeah
E	and writing your little bits about them all and
C	this was the same country that we got robbed at machete point in
E	yeah
C	and it's not safe to have a look around the
D	yeah
C	the hills and everything and it wasn't the problem was that to do a guided tour on this one was just too expensive er we just were I'm not gonna pay that kind of money and they were charging the same price so you pay twenty-five dollars for a guide and then it's another twenty-five dollars if you have another person but you only have one guide so why am I paying another twenty-five dollars for the same guide to do the same thing? and when your budget a day is only about fifteen dollars twenty dollars it's a lot of money when you're like
D	mm
C	I can go and do it myself and I will go and do it myself but we had to set off at like it because the clouds come in so early erm
E	do you carry anything with you?
C	there's no-one on this mountain I take a knife with me and we we usually try and pick up a big stick or a rock or something cos I mean dogs are a pain-in-the-arse anyway as you know and see what I mean
E	yeah
C	but for the rest of that hike I was like constantly on my guard like I was convinced I'd seen a big cat or something convinced I mean they're around they have like mountain lions and stuff
E	mm
C	at these kind of areas
D	it's scary stuff
C	it's er yeah
D	mm
C	in front of you and then the final eruption the wind took the eruption towards us and it just completely covered the skies and was like coming off our side of the mountain and we just
E	oh god
C	at that point we're like holy shit we are looking at like a really hot ball of steam like coming towards us so we started running back up the mountain you know exhilarated but also kind of scared and like that's when you realise you are just looking at a an erupting volcano you know
D	wow that is
C	they can shoot out ejecta we've been in a couple of places now it's a bit weird when you've been in a few places and then you look back and it only has to be a few months later Banos I've been to and Antigua both of those places had big volcanic eruptions and the whole place was evacuated like two or three months after we were there
E	yeah
C	like you're there and like
E	yeah
D	and you're there as it happens
E	then it happens a lot yeah
C	yeah you could be I mean we were we had we felt quite a big tremor when we were in this oasis in Peru and it's like a big it's just sand and like we're staying in the centre and there's literally you like a picture postcard oasis like just sand everywhere and everyone's like sandboarding and stuff it was quite cool but I felt this massive tremor when we were like in the thing and in my head I'm going surely the sand is just going to wobble and just fill in this hole do you know that's what I was thinking in my head it's going to kind of shake the hole full
D	mm
C	that kind of freaked me out as well I was like definitely been numerous times when I've been like yeah not
E	when you're freaked out do you talk about it?
C	yeah we get excited that's part of the thrills of travelling isn't it
E	mm
C	oh that could have happened this could have happened that one coming out of Banos we took that it wasn't a very long bus journey but it even sketchier than Nepal maybe just because of this one hairy bend that we took when the locals are scared that's when you know
D	yeah
C	to be scared
E	mm
C	and like the locals were erm we were going past the road which I'd been told was closed because of volcanic activity but our bus took this the local bus took this closed road apparently I mean you could see the ejecta there were big black boulders like strewn about that had clearly just shot recently out of the volcano and you're like cos we knew the
D	oh god really?
C	yeah and this was like two or three months later the whole town of like a hundred thousand people were evacuated cos the like and just say oh that's a bit sketchy the whole ground was made of like this grey silt everywhere it wasn't like proper ground or anything and we take this one corner and it's a real bend like this and we're on this crappy little bus and the tyre starts coming off and like we're trying to go round and like all the locals are like doing this and all this kind of shit and everyone's like kind of looking out and we're just sitting there like please get round this corner because it wasn't a big drop but it was maybe you know a hundred metres or something it was enough to kill you
D	it's gonna it's gonna make a mess innit
C	yeah and it's like er I will never forget that that bus
D	Jesus
C	we've had a few instances like that on buses
C	don't wanna don't want that to happen too much
E	mm
C	a bloody I didn't realise that we've had another time with crocodiles we didn't realise how do you know much about salt water crocodiles at all? do you realise how big they get? the biggest salt water crocodile ever caught was eight metres long I mean that's four times the length of a fully grown man you know what I mean? eight metre salt water crocodile that's that's a dinosaur really
C	we were on the
E	mm
C	off the coast of India nobody can go to these places they still have tribes that nobody has ever contacted on these islands erm
E	oh my god
C	and people were claiming that they need to be putting signs up on this place you know what mean? salt water crocodiles
E	and you've been swimming in it?
C	I was scuba diving around this area
E	oh my god
C	so I've been out there erm that's where I got the fire coral that like all went up my arm and shit but I mean at the same time we're thinking well no they shouldn't be putting signs up there this is some of the most remote parts of the world they're not there's no-one there
E	mm mm
C	they're not going to go and hammer in a sign everywhere and saying watch out salt water crocodiles
E	oh my god
C	there's us jumping in the mud around there and you know like
E	oh my
C	sliding around on our bellies going
E	god
C	and we knew there were crocodiles around but
E	and you could have just like a crocodile could have just put his mouth up out of the mud
C	yeah I dunno I mean I know they're around but
E	talk about living dangerously
C	I mean it's just I mean you say that but loads of people live there that's where people oh pardon me
C	that's where people live you know what I mean that's where people spend all their lives
E	yeah
C	it wasn't I wasn't even thinking about crocodiles at that point I was thinking about Bengal tigers which is the actual danger in the area and the whole reason we were there was to try and see Bengal tigers
D	he gets erm he gets night terrors there yeah
C	night terrors mum was saying
D	they're pretty nasty
C	is that what this is?
D	I guess so yeah it's about the right time yeah like an hour and a half
C	after he goes to sleep what's causing that?
D	I dunno we think it's like you know being anxious or
C	what's he got anxiety over?
D	well I dunno erm about school or
C	has he settled into school better now? cos when he first started going mum said he was that was a while ago now but
D	yeah he got them then
C	it was when
D	when he first started at school yeah and he came
C	cos he wasn't happy when he first went to school was he?
D	no
C	I think it's just a part of growing up it happens to some people
D	mm
C	bless him
D	they're not nice though
C	does he remember them?
D	no no he never does no
C	is he like kind of awake now or not?
D	yeah he'll be awake yeah
C	oh
D	or it seems like he's awake but
C	but he's asleep
D	yeah
C	no bless him
D	this might be different I don't know but
C	it's not like sleep paralysis or anything like that is it?
D	no
C	no that's meant to be nasty
D	that sounds like he's he's not well
C	does he get asthma or anything like that?
D	no
C	he's pretty healthy isn't he overall he's not like
D	yeah yeah
C	I was a bit of a sickly kid when I was young
D	was you?
C	yeah I had apparently I had was born with croup or something
D	oh really?
C	and then I had whooping cough for like the first few years I remember like every winter having this terrible painful cough it was like sounded like a barking dog
D	that must've been nice
C	yeah it was horrible I had pretty bad asthma for like a good few years
D	don't suffer with it any more?
C	no no not since I started smoking really it kind of like cleared it up
D	that's a bit weird isn't it?
C	yeah good for like controls my breathing or something
C	no that's so I've I grew out of that
D	that was one of the other reasons I didn't go for a general anaesthetic apparently when I've I had my tonsils out when I was about seventeen eighteen and I had a a massive asthma attack
C	oh
D	yeah and I never suffer from
C	do you have asthma as well?
D	no
C	no it was just a random
D	no never suffered from asthma
