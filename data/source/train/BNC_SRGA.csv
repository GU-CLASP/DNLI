A	as we hang around with people cos we're supposed to be like grow with the wise walk with the wise and grow wise is the proverb isn't it? erm
B	it depends what sort of things you mean
A	erm probably both yeah and lots of
A	in interesting ways
B	think maybe like
A	mm
B	but that comes out more as a negative thing for me in terms of like
A	yeah
B	I'm hoping that'll be different next
A	so you like withdraw and then
B	yeah
A	yeah
A	what? you can still hear it?
B	yeah or like if the washing machine's going it like shakes my bed or
A	oh really?

A	mm
B	I mean last year I had er as much that I ever wanted
A	yeah yeah that's cool yeah okay
B	I think also it's partly that is that obviously
A	yeah
B	it's like you're living with someone who
B	I think partly that
A	I guess it must be really hard when the person you you love as well and the person who you're there with and have been living for for ages and you you feel like this is you've
B	yeah
A	when it gets hard that must've been really hard
B	yeah
A	yeah

B	mm
A	another point of interest like one of the parks they have literally filled it with
B	mm
A	flower displays
A	and the programme we're watching is like going round asking them you know what does your display mean? and what is it about?
A	oh that's really nice mate
B	mm
A	do you wanna try?
B	mm
A	oh that's a bit too oh oh that's nice
B	that's a kick up your nose isn't it?
A	one of them had erm
B	what?
A	a
A	that turned or maybe fir or something
A	it was a huge tree
B	mm
A	all a bit over the top but
B	mm
A	I was thinking about this today I think my dreams when I was a child are very different to my dreams now
A	so so by
B	er no
A	when you were younger? or?
B	what you dream now but when you were younger as well
A	erm
B	mm
A	music would be really cool or tennis or something why did I say tennis?
B	yeah
A	I don't know why I love tennis erm
B	do you ever wanna coach tennis?
A	I would like yeah I'd like to do that I'd like to maybe try yeah coaching something coaching high level tennis or or football no actually coaching a football team wouldn't be a dream job but it would be interesting
B	yeah
A	I think if I'm honest one thing erm is I grew up having a very really high emphasis on it's not what you do it's who you are
B	mm
A	but now when I'm here I just don't know what the
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	it's like oh my dream job would be to be me but where do I apply myself?
B	yeah
A	I guess I've just gotta try and take different opportunities
B	would you ever do like wanna do like training like
A	erm
A	I think it does excite me I think the
B	okay yeah
A	or you're doing this but you're
B	yeah
A	you don't value like you really don't
B	yeah
A	pray about it that much you don't like and so I got a little bit
B	yeah
B	mm
A	I think I've just been a little bit disheartened about it but
A	yeah sure
B	oh no no no
A	the fan in
A	oh it wasn't even locked
B	yeah
A	did you
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	that's fine
A	what'd be your dream job? to be honest mate I'm just a little bit confused at the moment I dunno what to do
A	yeah cos you actually
B	yeah
A	small like small people not small people
B	I think if you said to me oh what's your dream job? I was like yeah it would be doing worship stuff and cos I do love leading people I do love seeing things change
A	mm
B	mm
A	missed opportunities
B	or like or like look back at er and this is
A	oh okay
B	was the same
A	okay yeah
B	but that's rubbish really
B	yeah
A	wow
B	I was like wow
A	wow
B	really cool actually cos I was like oh it almost gave me fresh hope for like my almost my song-writing
A	mm
A	has she written the whole song?
B	well she's written like two minutes
A	yeah yeah
B	and by recording stuff and becoming musically excellent
A	mm
A	have you ever heard him?
A	and he's played with such a
A	highly strung
A	I I think that
A	you were about to say something I'll let you
B	it's just well yeah
A	erm
B	yeah
A	but like not soon but like
B	yeah yeah
A	I don't have a home at the moment but that is
B	yeah
A	it's homely
B	yeah
A	oh
A	what about you?
B	I'd say this is my home well I think that's
A	okay yeah
B	and so I was looking for a home if you know what I mean
A	mm
B	whereas for you you'll always have a home where you grew up with your parents and
A	mm
B	and you've still got young siblings and
A	yeah
B	like they will always like there will always be a place to go back to
A	yeah
A	mm
A	there we go
A	yeah
B	but me and
B	we used to
B	I'd love to live in
A	or erm
A	oh that's my back coughing
A	that's my bowling
B	nice
B	mm
A	or erm
B	mm mm
A	or something that kind of suits you and you you get paid a lot?
B	something that really suits me and I don't get paid much
A	oh okay
B	I don't really
A	mm
B	I don't really mind
A	right that's cool
B	and being able to play golf
B	I think that's
A	yeah
B	mm
A	I
B	how about you?
A	I've started to I've started to think about it a little bit more recently started to I
B	mm mm
A	erm feeling like they have things rather than they
B	don't have
A	they come into this world like without anything
B	mm
A	guess we all have to work for things but feeling like they are valued and championed and
B	mm
A	can pursue anything that they want and I can resource it
B	mm
A	I think
B	I want that
A	you want to? or you don't?
A	okay
A	ah
A	ah
B	real life innit?
B	the reality is by the time like
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	like I might not be able to buy them like a swimming pool
A	mm
B	but like
A	I dunno
B	sometimes sometimes
A	yeah
A	really annoying
B	no
A	oh good question yes that's a very good question I mean yeah I think I've been asking that a lot like as in er the question the
B	mm
B	yeah
A	yeah I dunno mate it's er interesting reading the some of the like old philosophy
B	mm
A	it's really interesting
B	what was the question?
A	I think what do you want out of life?
B	oh right
A	it's a pretty good one
B	like I don't really care
A	right that's cool
B	which is the change like to see
A	mm a big vision yeah
B	yeah like
B	I think I always wanna keep that mindset as like what really matters here?
A	mm
B	mm mm
A	and like
B	and teaching your kids to know who they are
A	yeah
B	cos then they'll change the world
A	do you know there's like there's this kid at my er in my
B	mm
A	and he's he's really cool? cos he's just like
B	mm
A	and erm I kind of wanna be like that myself but I also want to help my kids to be like that
B	yeah
A	just know they've got nothing to prove
B	yeah
A	and erm
B	mm yeah
A	do you reckon there's much protein in this?
A	bit of calcium
A	is that something that that you er like were were ever interested in that erm?
B	being nice to people?
A	no
A	no well I know that's not true
B	harsh
A	extremely nice
A	how do you think their cricket went?
B	mm
B	just feel a lot more comfortable then
A	mm
B	I was pleased that I was able to work out what I was doing
A	what you were doing?
B	well
A	oh what you were doing wrong? what were you doing?
B	I wasn't
A	oh okay
B	yeah
A	I wish I knew what I was doing wrong
A	I was just got a bit carried away I think
A	just trying to show off
B	your bowling's very nearly like very good
A	thanks mate
A	I know
B	mm
A	or is it just like?
B	the er rhythm thing
B	mm I just think you started off
A	I didn't get fast
B	you never got faster
A	okay
B	in your run-up in your it's like it started off quite quick and then it stayed at the same pace whereas I'd
A	okay
B	and that
A	flying through it like a
B	a what?
B	yes
A	it's like it's fluid isn't it? the top bowlers are so fluid
B	yeah
A	I want that
B	mm
A	oh
B	mm mm mm
A	sorry
B	mm
A	there's only one thing for it just gonna have to go and practise more
B	mm
A	Republic of Ireland Holland does that say?
A	to win
B	what are the odds?
A	nine till nine to two
A	probably for the best
A	I feel like
B	er
A	mm?
A	yeah I am
B	just cos?
A	erm mum and dad said go and do some travelling you need to do some travelling see some different cultures and erm
B	yes
A	I know I want to as well
B	yes mum and dad they'll say we'd love to pay for you to go and do that
A	erm I'm going to
B	mm
B	yeah
A	erm but I think this one's gonna be kind of five hundred pounds cheaper so
B	there's always the future as well
A	there's always the future yeah so it's I do want to surf in Australia though
B	mm
A	I think that could be an
A	and I I feel I've got some cookie at the bottom of mine
B	mm how
A	erm
A	yeah er very well
B	mm
A	kind of we haven't spent ages of time together
B	sure
A	but we really connect
B	yeah
A	when we do erm
A	he's actually the only person I I kind of wrestle
A	like you don't like as in just like
A	physically and just like
B	yeah
A	I mean I wrestle you but not like
B	mentally
A	physically
A	mentally wrestle you
B	I don't it'd be a very pretty picture for you if we wrestled
A	I wouldn't let you
A	I think it's cool the more that we can do like to
B	yeah
A	introduce some of our friends into
B	mm
A	yeah
B	I was really pleased cos I bowled well to
A	he was
B	he was being a proper player
A	he's really good he's extremely good at hockey
B	is he? what team does he play for?
B	what position does he play?
A	central
A	cricket's his main sport yeah but
B	oh yeah
B	I felt like I felt like he was he was
A	mm he didn't have that bowling
B	he didn't bowl
A	I bowled to him though and I was pleased cos I got it just on a nice length and got a bit of bounce as well so he was like defending so I was pleased
B	actually sometimes you're so you're so you're like
A	okay yeah
B	and so it's almost like start with just start with it short
A	okay
B	and just
A	that's cool
B	so focus on just going
A	okay yeah
B	cos when you're running in I'm like man this is gonna be quick and then I was like oh it's not so quick
A	yeah
A	yeah I know yeah
B	but then you
B	that taught me a good lesson
A	right you wait till next time
B	it's weird like my desire like I don't mind doing like nets and stuff but like my desire to play cricket just it's completely
A	since playing?
A	since playing erm at the weekend?
B	oh erm not necessarily but like
A	yeah
B	but I enjoy going to nets and just having fun with
A	right yeah yeah
A	cos you don't wanna go back to
B	yeah
A	yeah no that's cool that's cool like keep it where you are
B	no but that's the thing is like if I went and played now I'd like I'd be
A	well then keep yeah
B	yeah
A	whereas now you'll have to work up
B	yeah
B	whereas with golf I'm like
B	so that
A	that was like not the first thing
A	so that was a real check for me
A	because I can always do press-ups I can do press-ups wherever and I'll always be able to do press-ups but that would have made press-ups really hard
B	it probably would
A	would it be golf?
B	yeah
A	or bass? or?
[ANNOTATION]	Doing press-ups is impossible for speaker A, it has always been and it will always be.	Contradiction
B	yeah it would be I reckon it would be golf and then it would be guitar well maybe
A	yeah
B	I
B	yeah I love
B	I love playing I love specifically playing with other people against other people like in my group I love having I love having a good social competitive game that is just fun
A	yeah I know
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B got to see Tiger Woods playing golf twice.	Neutral
B	like I think I'm fine and I'm going to play golf with my dad and one of his old mates when he was in
A	cos you are better than him then obviously?
B	yeah yeah
A	yeah yeah
A	okay
[ANNOTATION]	B is better at playing golf than their dad.	Entailment
B	whereas he was
B	what do you what do you think you like about the gym what about the gym do you like?
A	to be honest mate I think it's the it's not competitive but competitiveness in myself
B	yeah
A	physically and more able to do things more like
A	more able to do things
A	yes put it on my room I'm in er
B	yeah thank you that was a
A	if we do
[ANNOTATION]	The gym that A goes to has a bouldering wall that allows them to challenge themselves very often.	Neutral
B	yeah in the garden?
A	make it up to an hour
B	yeah
A	if you don't mind
B	yeah that's fine
A	erm actually we've gotta keep it going for the hour but don't worry I'll just I'll just keep it going now erm
B	you do wanna feel strong don't you? like you want to I don't know er you want to like
B	you want to sort of I want to feel in good shape
A	yeah
B	but I don't want I but that
[ANNOTATION]	A wants to feel strong, to better themselves.	Entailment
A	okay okay yeah yeah yeah I think that's true I think if I wasn't doing it I think I'd be thinking I I think it would be silly for me to stop
A	not doing anything
B	I always think like doing circuits and stuff like that's
A	as in outside in the park like
B	like doing running
A	running and then doing
[ANNOTATION]	Steve also likes running.	Neutral
B	yeah
A	press-ups and stuff
B	and like if you said to me I'm going to the going to the gym every day to lift weights so I can
A	yeah
B	look good or my biceps are gonna get massive
A	yeah
B	then I'd be like mm but like the like you're basically doing sport when you go and do circuits like you're building your fitness up like
A	yeah so do you say I suppose you say you'd condone cardio but not power-based stuff?
B	well er no cos I think you can do I think you can do power-based stuff but I think it's about I think maybe I can
A	okay yeah
B	but I couldn't understand
A	okay yeah
A	yeah
B	and so but that's it's purely that's it's it's purely it's purely through my eyes really
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	right okay I can er oh sorry just gotta put my
A	sorry?
B	you've got the time on you haven't you?
A	yeah it's now erm four forty-one
