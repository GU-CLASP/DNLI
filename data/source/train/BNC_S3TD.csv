A	so I've been looking at superstitions for a class tomorrow
B	okay
A	you believe in
B	erm I believe in good luck and bad but I know it's something you can just perceive you you can get down on yourself and think erm you know I never get any luck
A	mm
B	or something that you couldn't've foreseen
A	things go wrong yeah
B	things seem
A	yeah
B	because the
A	yeah
B	no I don't
A	yeah it's kind of erm you know but but if you broke a mirror for example would you immediately think oh that's good you know that's seven years bad luck?
B	no I wouldn't
A	no
B	I don't think mind you I I've never
B	cos I don't think I've ever actually broken one
A	yeah
B	no no
A	no?
B	pepper not salt
B	mm
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	and what about erm
B	erm
A	do you cross your fingers or?
B	I tell you what actually
A	yeah
B	but er not all the time but sometimes and but but I I kept winning and I thought to myself that I go inside of
A	mm
B	to this guy
B	he was just he didn't he didn't have a cup or a bowl or what have you
A	right
B	yeah
A	oh
B	but due to the fact that I'd actually thought hello I'm being er you know sort of paid back here for for being er nice and generous
A	right
B	but I thought this is absolute nonsense and I didn't wanna go one day through that side and I was a bit later and I wanted to go through the centre of the station
A	mm
B	I
A	oh you still won oh okay yeah
B	still won er er so er
A	mm
B	you know that that was good
A	yeah
B	that was good that that something had happened yeah
A	yeah that you did it
B	oh they do erm they complain about their back luck by kicking the machine and er swearing at the telly and what have you no I think it's er I think you get it more it it's er in sport where one person always puts always to go out last
A	mm
B	always puts one boot on er you know before the other
A	oh like a footballer
B	yes footballer
A	yeah
B	he'll always do
A	yeah
B	er all this sort of stuff
A	yeah
B	or have a lucky you know what people have a
A	I think I remember Bjorn Borg
B	mm
A	have a ritual? I think he didn't shave for the whole of Wimbledon
A	so he always ended the Wimbledon fortnight with a little beard
B	yeah they they
A	yeah
B	did that I
A	yeah
B	said no I don't actually I don't believe I'm superstitious I just do certain things before a game to ensure that other things don't happen
A	like what?
B	well that's he's saying that's exactly what superstitions is
B	he's saying he's not
A	oh okay yeah
B	but it was just the fact was it
A	yes
B	what er
A	yeah
B	yeah and so he was saying that he was superstitious yeah
A	yeah
B	what about you and luck you don't er?
A	I don't believe in it at all I just think it's everything's a coincidence really
B	mm
A	you'll think of that as bad luck won't you?
B	it's just
A	yeah
B	though isn't it but it's not
A	yeah
B	there's nothing
A	but you haven't brought it upon yourself or
B	no one you haven't brought on yourself no one's picking
A	yeah
B	on you it's just some things good happen to you and some things bad happen to you
A	yeah and you can't do anything about it so you
B	but if keeps happening to you start getting to think oh god dear why's this?
A	you know do you remember that erm friends of mum and dad's called unlucky
B	yes
A	no I
B	yeah
A	always get caught or he'd he'd choose the night that they were being inspected or you know things like that and erm and he was forever in plaster you know he'd turn up to meet them
A	mm
B	I don't know if you
A	mm
B	you
A	no they said you
B	yeah
A	and he was about sixty or so so you know he was just used I suppose
B	he trades on
A	yeah
B	oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	maybe they weren't all true
B	mm
A	erm a
B	yeah
A	erm
B	yeah I mean I really
A	but
B	cos once you get into those things
[ANNOTATION]	When you reach the age of sixty, the government gives you a free haircut.	Neutral
A	well they're just symbols really they're not actually you know nobody really believes they're going to bring luck
B	mm
A	something blue that's gonna be erm you know bad luck for the future
B	just actually it's erm
A	it's just like a ritual isn't it?
A	yeah
B	you know
A	yeah
B	you know and then really because if something did happen
A	yes
[ANNOTATION]	Nobody actually thinks that they are going to make you good fortune.	Entailment
B	I might find myself thinking well I was a bit silly why didn't I just you know I
A	yeah
B	I don't
A	no and and of course to prove how daft the whole thing is
B	mm
A	if you ask people internationally about black cats
B	mm mm
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B would never think of himself as silly, they are a very serious person	Contradiction
A	you know they're they're mostly bad luck but in our country they're good luck
B	and and we have say lucky number seven or what
A	yeah
B	have you or the
A	yes
B	they're not exactly the same the world over apparently
A	er well I don't know about the other countries other than Italy but in Italy it's erm
B	mm kay
A	and I've
B	mm
A	but I don't know if you know
[ANNOTATION]	Black cats are bad luck internationally.	Contradiction
A	oh right what was that then?
A	yeah
B	either they would lose a wicket at eighty-seven or what have you
A	I'm sorry I'm not quite sure what I whether I understand that
B	well when they
A	oh okay
[ANNOTATION]	In Italy, if you see a black cat you should touch wood immediately.	Neutral
B	was worried until they got off the number
A	right
B	because it's something would seem to happen when they scored eighty-seven
A	right
B	and someone'd go well someone'd go that's two eighty-sevens innit?
A	oh
B	or or two hundred and sixty-one
A	yeah that that's like three eighty-sevens
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	so you can make what you want of that but you know
A	you'd have be good at arithmetic
B	but or or or any Australian at cricket
B	there is a number
A	yeah
B	that you know if you think oh Christ now eighty-seven you know
A	yeah
B	you know you'd be very pleased
A	right
B	you'd be very pleased
B	yeah
A	erm other sports is it just cricket or?
B	no well that's just different things and I suppose some of
A	you know is it? but is it like a general number?
B	some of them back erm erm probably said do you know do you know the number of times we've lost a wicket or at the number eighty-seven? and then you know it just gets one of those things that that just escalates you know
A	oh okay
B	I mean obviously there's nothing in it
A	yes
B	but the fact is you know
A	yeah
B	it's cricketers boringly they've scored ninety you know to get to a hundred at cricket
A	yeah
B	to get to a hundred is a milestone
A	yeah
B	so blokes play quite beautifully freely until they get to ninety
A	yes
B	and then suddenly they get worried
A	yeah
B	because they've gotta score the last ten runs they call it the nervous nineties
A	right okay
B	okay so the fact is you could put that
A	yes cos of because of the
B	as soon as you get to a hundred and one you start playing normal cricket
A	yes
B	what how daft is that?
A	yes
B	and the same is same with someone says Christ boy chap you're on eighty-seven so you start playing daft you wanna get off you wanna hit a ball you shouldn't hit or it
A	yeah
B	so it's
A	yeah
B	oh yeah yeah I don't know how many he had of these red shirts
B	well no but the thing is that they lose as well obviously
A	yeah
B	don't they
A	yeah
B	there was a horse race trainer who would always wear a red shirt
A	yeah
B	now the fact is well you know but the fact is he must've had bad days when he if he wore it all the time
A	yeah
B	he must've had a lot of bad days when he was wearing the red shirt
A	mm
B	you know so in the end it's all a bit
A	yes
B	you know I suppose he has even worse luck if he doesn't wear it
A	yeah
B	you'd you would
A	you'd wear your lucky red shirt yeah
B	you'll feel happy I suppose with yourself no I
B	yeah
A	I know and you
B	yeah I don't yeah yeah
A	yeah
B	so you can imagine how easily it can get a grip of you know this sort of stuff
A	yes yes I'm glad I'm not a slave to it but the erm Mrs
B	mm
A	training or something
B	mm
