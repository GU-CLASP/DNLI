B	that was an eyeopener for you wasn't it?
C	it was
B	right okay I'll tell you what we normally do
C	right
B	ten
C	oh my word
B	yeah well they're only
A	they're like tiny little chicken wings
C	oh right yeah yeah
B	they're only little ones
C	yes
B	er so we ask for the ten of those
C	yes
B	and half will be lemon and herb
C	yes
B	and half will be
C	yeah
B	and then we'll also get a houmous dip
C	yes
B	pitta bread
C	yes
B	and it comes with a little Peri-Peri drizzle
C	yes
B	tastes of paprika basically so it tastes like chorizo
C	yes
B	so we pour that on top of it and we mix it all in and we have a dips and it's really nice
C	mm mm is it
B	and then we
C	quite spicy?
B	erm not really
A	well
B	it's like tastes of chorizo
A	it's a mild spice
C	tingles yes
B	it tastes of pizza it does
A	it tastes of paprika
B	it's paprika
C	yeah
B	er and then we get a burger and something each but we don't we used to get
A	I don't I yeah I don't get anything with it
B	I used yeah we used to get sides but we've now started doing the the wing platter
C	yes
B	and the houmous we don't get sides
C	right
B	but normally what most people do is get erm
C	yeah
B	and normally choose one of these and then they get a side or two sides to go with it
C	yes
B	but we gave up on that cos the sides are just chips or
C	we'll have a starter
A	yeah
B	er yeah it just works out better
C	yeah
B	yeah so you you have a quick look at
C	yeah
B	the er where is it?
A	starters
B	starter the houmous
C	yeah
B	Peri-Peri
C	right that's it? that's fine
B	yeah
A	are you going up? have I still got your Nando's card?
B	probably yeah well done
A	I'm not really sure I I know I went up last time I think cos I went with dad but I'm not sure if I held onto it or not
B	yeah I've got it
A	you got it?
B	got mine
A	yes you have
B	that's
A	two tickets for the six twenty-five
B	yeah
A	erm to and it's the very last like day of whatever's showing but it's really hard to tell like what's about to like go yeah so like I went even on today it's Thursday and it's the and it didn't even say what what was the Last Chance Thursday so I don't know if you just have to like ring up
B	get lucky
A	on the day and be like oh what what's the Last Chance Thursday? or whatever but
C	so what
B	I might do that and that
A	with chicken in it?
B	yeah
A	I don't think you'll need that one
A	yeah cos
B	okay yeah
A	there's no need to be an absolute pig and I didn't even finish my burger last time
B	no
A	I'm sure it's good
A	just go and just order something for her cos she probably won't
B	she'll probably have the wrap
A	yeah
B	yeah shut up
C	that's it exactly that's it that one the burger and chips and a burger
B	you want a burger the chicken
C	the chicken in a burger
B	chicken burger
C	yeah
B	and do you want mango and lime or lemon and herb?
C	sorry?
B	mango and lime or lemon and herb?
A	decisions decisions
C	lemon and herb
B	lemon and herb what do you want?
C	or mango and lime I don't
B	need to know
C	I don't mind
B	right so that
A	make sure you get the Butterfly Burger
B	oh wow that looked good
C	stick it on this card I'm paying
A	actually
C	are you not you're not paying
B	alright give me your card I need some cash
C	well I'll give you a card
B	get it out then
A	erm I don't know if I can do two two of us maybe just do the one
C	and er keep your finger over the number
A	what about security?
C	no it's something
A	oh the heat sensors?
C	well er the the cameras anything can pick up the numbers anybody er in case anyone
B	do you want a drink?
C	oh yes please
B	it's er soft drinks are bottomless
C	are they good?
B	they're bottomless so you can fill them up
C	oh right
A	you you basically just get given a glass
C	yeah
A	and you go and grab whatever it is that you want
C	is there is there any
B	well there is but it's not that's not bottomless the bottomless would be
A	but she can have some apple juice if she wants it
B	if you want apple juice you can have apple juice do you want apple juice instead?
C	no I'm well if I thinking I'm just thinking I'm thinking they do
A	I think your mum looks confused
B	do you want
C	I don't mind
C	I don't mind
B	alright
C	I'll have the
B	so
C	I think apple
B	apple
A	that was my first choice
C	yeah it was I put that down on the
A	yeah I I remember watching this thing on TV where like they were saying that erm a lot of criminals have started cos erm they can basically they can work out your code based on cos if so say you've got like four numbers
C	oh
A	and so they can see what the last four
C	the pressure
A	cos of the cos you leave heat marks or something
C	yeah
A	or actually it's an app it's an app so that if they hold their phone over the erm payment thing it can pick up the heat signals like it's like thermal you know like the thermal imaging that you see the police interceptors using?
C	yeah
A	like it's an app that does the same thing so what it does is it highlights the last four numbers that were used and obviously that really limits what the
C	yes
A	different codes it could be
C	fingers on everything
A	yeah
C	I'm gonna start doing that as well
A	yeah
C	cos I don't trust anybody
A	no and you shouldn't really
C	no
A	but the thing is as well you know like even if they have your code they still have to get hold of your card to be able to
C	yes
A	do anything with it so
C	yeah the thing is if anything happened with any of the the numbers and things I would feel so violated
A	yeah
C	it would really affect me
A	yeah
C	cos when they the when they had the attempted break-in in the house the boys were quite small but it really did affect me for a long long time
A	yeah
C	and I was seconds away from opening the kitchen door and seeing that person at that window if I'd have done that I would have had to leave
A	I think it really shocked my mum when we had our break-in
C	that person went in
A	yeah cos as you
C	oh god
A	she was like she wasn't really used to just being the only one in the house so
C	yeah
A	I think he really shook her it wasn't long after that that we moved
C	yeah
A	I don't think it was linked I think that there was a lot of reasons why we moved but I do think mum just didn't feel very safe there anymore
C	yes
A	we certainly went through a period of having to lock the door as soon as you got in the house which just wasn't a very nice feeling
C	yeah yeah
A	we do that now though I think it's it's not a bad habit to get into is it really?
C	yeah it's changed everything's changed
A	I think it would be different if we had people coming in and out of the house but once I know me and
C	lock the door
A	yeah
C	yeah we do yeah and if we're eating I always lock the front door
A	yeah
C	didn't used to
A	it would be really easy for you to not notice though wouldn't it really? especially like if you and
C	in the kitchen and the TV's on
A	yeah
C	and there's been a few times I've heard things and I felt oh it's the cat
A	yeah
C	yeah anyway are you well?
A	yeah I'm well
C	just the commute
A	yeah and do you know what? like I'm getting used to it I think if I can make it through winter I think that would be a fairly significant step because it was easy enough during the summer because it was
C	yes
A	it wasn't a bad drive and
C	yeah
A	kind of journey and I was getting in easy I was getting home easy and like also like
C	so the difference is the schools?
A	the difference is the schools hugely yeah and also the bad weather because those that probably would have cycled or
C	yes yes
A	are put off when it gets to when it gets to winter so there is there is more traffic now especially like trying to get out of
C	after Christmas it'll die down probably
A	it'll die down and I think as well like I'm I'm I'm getting used to it because I think more than anything it's a mental adjustment
C	oh yes
A	so I obviously got quite I got quite used to leaving the house at a certain time and getting home at a certain time and you have to adjust your expectations when you're commuting but in the grand scheme of things like I only
C	and that's a commuter town
A	yeah
C	and all that traffic on the road
A	it's not really I'm not really I mean the thing is I leave at the same time as
C	does he get paid for the extra time?
A	yeah
C	oh good
A	he gets paid overtime
C	yes
A	but like
C	well that that's a good
A	exactly
C	for the two of you
A	but the thing is even if he even if he left work straightaway the earliest he'd be home is half past five so that's only an hour before me anyway so to say that I actually commute I don't actually have that long a day in comparison
C	yes
A	to him so I really can't complain
C	do you only have half an hour for lunch?
A	I can have whatever I want but it depends it it a hundred percent depends on like traffic in the morning so I always leave at half past eight but on a good day I'll get in at half past nine so I could have an hour for lunch and still leave at half past five but if there's traffic and I don't get in
C	thank you
A	I don't get in till nearer to ten o'clock
C	Coke Zero?
A	it cuts my
B	Coke Zero
A	what?
B	Coke Zero?
A	yeah thank you erm yeah if I don't get in till ten o'clock
B	erm
A	and I still wanna leave at half past five obviously that means I can only have half an hour for lunch but I don't really mind at the moment obviously in the summer you can go for a walk and stuff but it's not really walky weather at the moment so I don't really wanna do a lot with my lunch
C	no
A	I just wanna eat
C	yes
A	and then carry on
C	yes
A	I'd rather leave early
C	yes
A	but yeah it's it's pretty naff especially at night like
C	yes
A	if I leave late and get in late that works but if you try and do anything that's remotely around the peak times you've got no chance
C	and remember bank holidays I remember what happened that May bank holiday
A	I've had worse
B	there's nothing you can do
A	but I mean they are like
B	but use the
A	oh I meant to tell you my friend
C	where?
A	she works in
C	yes
A	kind of near
C	yes
A	really I think
C	yes yeah
A	maybe an extra half an hour forty minutes on from where I am
C	yeah
A	and she said she left work once at half past five and didn't get to
B	oh wow similar to him
A	so
unknown_female	okay so houmous starter yeah?
B	thank you very much
C	thank you
A	are we having the wings with the meat?
B	I dunno I just ran through it
B	it's a it's a lot less houmous than normal
A	yeah but we always have some left
B	okay
A	put it on one side so if anyone doesn't like it
B	maybe mum should try it first
A	she needs it with the houmous otherwise it's not really
B	should have
C	very oily
B	wanna shake it? yeah that's the oil sorry I should have shaken it
C	mm
A	we really like this I don't normally like houmous but I like with the with the drizzle

B	they'll probably be gone
C	well it's a thought isn't it?
A	that'd actually be really nice
B	do you get food?
C	but you can eat at ours
A	I think that's what
C	we dad and I are going to be in
A	that actually would be really really nice but I don't erm
C	because what we might do wrap up though it'll be cold
A	yeah
C	erm and something on your feet so
A	yeah
C	what I was gonna say was
A	oh that'll be nice
C	mm
A	me and
B	yeah we don't know what we're gonna do
C	do you want to? oh with each other?
B	we'd like to
C	no save that for Christmas
A	even though we know
B	yeah we
C	you might have forgotten by Christmas Day
C	so when's the dog arriving?
A	I'd love a dog I told
B	yeah I don't I don't want a ginger cat
C	no?
B	black and white cat
C	see I like a brown tabby wouldn't mind a brown tabby
B	yeah
C	or a grey tabby a pale grey tabby with white feet
A	that's quite specific
C	I know I saw one on a on a film or something and it was just the most striking cat
B	brothers?
C	yeah like
B	like like that one that
C	yeah
B	that long
C	a huge cat want
B	like a Maine or something what were they called? er
C	oh Maine Coons?
B	Maine Coons
C	I wouldn't want long-haired cats I just want big cats big thick fur
A	yeah
C	round faces
A	I would be I'd definitely be open to the idea of having a cat once the site work's finished I think I don't really know if I'd feel comfortable having a cat when there's such big
C	no
B	what are you doing
C	you can have mine
B	can I have yours as well?
C	no
B	go go for half of it go on then
A	erm so what have you got what have you got
C	for Christmas I've got
C	yeah but he'll love it won't he? he'll love it
A	sounds quite cool
C	isn't it? he'll love it
A	to go with all his chutneys?
C	yeah and he can make his own cheese
A	wow
C	is it'll be soft cheese
A	yeah
C	but
A	that's quite cool
C	and er all sorts of things I've done
A	I've told
C	I know
A	for his birthdays Christmas it's like
C	I know
A	oh I need this new gadget
C	yeah
B	yeah I've always forgotten what he's asked for
C	I know
B	I mean maybe something like secateurs he always needs secateurs
C	he always needs secateurs he does
B	I bought him
C	always needs secateurs
B	I bought him secateurs I bought him a saw
C	or yeah
B	I bought him
C	drill
B	a hose I bought him
B	I bought him that thing last year
C	yeah
B	he's always asked for them
B	I'll get you a saw
C	well this year we've gone for some quirky practical things now that you're er house
B	oh yeah?
C	that you wouldn't normally buy for yourselves so there's some really weirdy things and then there's some just practical things and then surprises and then some lovely things
B	some of us own our own houses
C	yeah
A	I know it's pretty scary
B	do we tell her what we found out this
A	yeah I think
C	yeah
A	I think we might start trying to overpay a little bit on the mortgage because I just the way I see it is
C	yes
A	so that the next time we buy
C	yes
A	we can
C	yes yes
A	erm but I think as it stands only about a third of what we pay each month is going against the capital
C	right
A	so obviously if we could afford to overpay a little bit each month it's just gonna boost up what we have
C	of course it will
A	at the end so I think
C	for
A	we're gonna sit down properly and once once we're once we're comfortable
C	yeah
A	once we've actually done what we
C	yeah
A	wanna do in the house
C	yeah
A	we'll kind of sit down and work out if we can afford
C	yes
A	cos I just think it will make a huge difference
C	yes
B	no this one
C	mm?
B	they don't no
C	oh right
B	your refills will have to be Fanta Sprite or Coke
C	Fanta or Sprite?
B	or Coke
C	Sprite
B	then do you wanna finish off?
C	ah can you manage three?
B	yeah well I was gonna go up and get the
A	erm
B	the the they just come with the flavour
A	erm when I was I obviously went to erm
C	he's quite relaxed
A	I know
C	was he having a little pop at you then?
A	no
C	oh right yeah
A	erm
C	yeah
A	so I came home like yesterday and broke the news that quite a lot of it was interest
C	yes
A	erm
C	yeah
A	it's just it's it's a horrible thing cos you just think like
C	yes
A	by paying more now but
C	yes
A	so it's it's a really hard one cos it make financial sense
C	I know mm
A	to pay as much as you can now
C	yeah yeah
A	and then when we're your age hopefully we'll be in the same situation as you
C	yeah
A	in that we'll have paid everything off and
C	when when we were your age we couldn't see it
A	no
A	we just like you just going on and on and on and
B	you might have a bit of tang of Fanta in there
B	I accidentally put some Fanta in and and
C	looks fine
B	a knife maybe
A	erm yeah maybe
C	yeah
A	so I don't want to
C	we erm

C	mm
A	let her drown in the stuff
C	well the doctor the GP before she went to this nursing home where they've done so much for her at one point she started taking over and ordering everyone around and hoping that but then got a bit
A	yeah

C	yeah
B	it would probably work out probably fifty quid a hundred quid cheap which we you could keep worse off than less we'd have no money
B	we'd have no money
A	we're not gonna lose our jobs
B	in theory
C	well
B	you could buy us out though couldn't you?
A	we're not
B	oh yeah if I get a pay rise first
C	yeah
B	and just oh I spoke cos obviously went went up to
C	mm mm
B	I'm in the car with
C	uhu
B	and my boss
C	oh yeah yes
B	so we're
C	yeah
B	he should be on a higher wage
A	he I think he's on a similar wage to me which is just ridiculous
B	yeah
A	cos
C	is this
B	yeah and let's face it we're trying to we we're
C	how much is an installation? how much does it bring profit for the company?
B	erm I'd say a
C	how much responsibility financially are you
B	my in my
C	if you went wrong it would cost a lot of money wouldn't it?
B	yeah erm
C	right
B	so that's fifty grand in theory
C	yeah
B	so
C	so there's there's a lot of money in the pot isn't there?
B	yeah and some people have er waivers so a customer might have ten thousand pounds worth of excess costs that the company will just write off as soon as they get it
C	it's absorbed?
B	so up to ten thousand pounds worth on that cost so we're delivering the circuit
C	well so if a ceiling's put on that
B	yeah so
C	then it can go to look after the staff
B	I'm saying what I'm saying I'm saying if we if I deliver him that circuit and we provide the circuit
C	yeah
B	that's nine million pounds
C	wow
B	in theory
A	mm
B	so I suppose it's a large like our
C	however however you've got a job and you're being paid
A	I think the aim is
C	and you're staff
A	what's
C	yeah
B	have a look around erm
A	I really want him to finish his degree so that's what I
C	I do and if you're there it's a safe place to be while you do that
A	yeah well the idea is actually
C	yeah
A	cos if he'd get help it might allow him to
B	part-time
A	do part-time which I think would facilitate studying more
C	yeah
B	cos cos I'm not
A	I think he's too stressed at the moment to try and do a
B	I'm in a job that's stressful
C	yeah
B	really stressful we we're we're hit on we have so many things we have to meet
C	yeah
B	and so many
C	yeah
B	stats
A	I can barely get him to do anything in the evening as it is like
C	really?
B	that's what the problem is yeah
A	let alone trying to get him to do like studying
B	it's so short short-staffed right
C	yeah
B	closed the office in
C	yeah
B	that was like
C	is that guy still with you the one at
B	they've he's he's just just got a promotion and became manager
C	oh lovely
B	yeah but I've only been there a year people you you have to be there about two years before you're even considered
C	yeah would that be a nice increment for you?
A	it would be a substantial
B	about six grand six grand more
C	mm
B	but a lot a lot of pressure
A	a lot of like he'd have to be
C	right
B	and stress
A	pretty much have to be the first one erm in the office and the last one out
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	because you have to be able to say like my team did this or my team are doing that
C	yeah
B	erm
C	yeah yeah
B	er some of them moved up to
C	but you've got all the
A	yeah
B	all the
A	the problem seems to be as well like their recruitment their recruitment and training scheme doesn't kind of be enough to get people to stay so even though they've got new people starting who won't stay for very long because
B	it's fifteen people already left account that have left
C	and you've been there
B	in the last six months
A	he's saying this week that new people are
B	oh no sixteen sixteen
C	what sort of jobs are they going to? are they getting better money or is it just to get away from the pressure?
B	erm
A	both
B	a few a few progression
C	mm mm
B	oh yeah and then two people the no three people who had that have gone to team managers within so that's that's
C	mm
B	so nineteen people that have left our job roles
C	good lord
B	a few have gone over to the
C	mm mm
B	er three people have gone to team management roles three people have gone to like our quality improvement team
C	yeah
B	erm and then
C	mm
A	and the new people they're getting in they're not even like spending any time with
B	right
A	that they're just dumping them on the floor
B	yeah they've they've dumped some people on floor this week that last week of the month we're doing a six hundred and fifty K push to the end of the year we we've we've not hit our targets this month we hit our targets last month like a huge huge ask but what we ended up doing was pulling the load of work from November putting it into October to hit our targets the first week from November had no installs there was nothing to install so it was trickling through pulling through the rest of the month we got to the end of the month and we we now we're about eighty K short on the monthly revenue eighty K
A	by tomorrow
B	it's fucking stupid
C	oh god
B	and because they keep putting it forward so many things are failing because they're desperately trying to get contractors to finish and desperately trying to get us to finish and we're not getting handovers from BT and it's it's shit and and I'm
C	yeah
B	everything's
C	it's a lot of talking the talk isn't it?
B	yeah a lot
C	a lot of talking the talk
B	our head of department is an absolute idiot
A	I know far too
B	it's erm it's just so you don't shut off you don't shut off
C	sounds like hard work
B	you you can
C	yeah
B	it's so shit
C	so to progress you need your degree do you?
B	not at
A	I was saying to him I saw a job at ours this week
C	yes
A	which which it probably
B	it's not the same
A	yeah I mean it was it was it was a digital project coordinator
C	mm mm
A	and it was for
C	mm
A	he doesn't necessarily have but it the project all the kind of tasks he'd be doing aren't dissimilar to what he's doing now erm but the salary is nearly ten grand more
C	wow
A	but it said degree essential
C	yeah
A	and project management
B	starting was twenty-six?
A	twenty-six and a half yeah
B	twenty-six and a half
C	you've gotta get your degree
B	yeah I started on seventeen three five O I got a one percent pay increase equivalent to like fifty-two quid or something
C	yeah
B	great one seven five two three
C	mm
B	it's
C	yeah yeah
B	but like we've got one guy started two weeks ago?

A	who's that?
A	that's
B	yeah and he's about to have a his er fiancée is about to have a kid

B	he was overworked
A	she can't be
B	no it's but she can't be making any but yeah so she
C	she must be living at home
B	she yeah she's living with her parents
C	yeah
B	cos she's finished the
C	mm
B	so now living with her parents but yeah she's really overworked and you can tell she's just all over the place she's only been there for like a month two months
A	she should not have been allowed to go on holiday for three weeks
B	she
C	three
B	she's gone to Australia so
A	three weeks though
B	yeah

B	well his his his brother had cancer his brother died
C	did he?
A	and then his mum got ill
B	and then his mum got really ill he dropped he
C	mm
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about fathers	Contradiction
B	just a normal guy
A	I don't think they were being very erm understanding
B	understanding
A	of his personal situation either so he was kind of being urged to come back even though there was clearly a lot still going on at home
B	I know erm it turns out that
B	turns out
B	he was ex-
C	yeah
B	so it seemed to be a bit of a stopgap bit like when dad
A	yeah
C	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	they are not sure about dad	Neutral
B	he signed off
C	yeah
B	it's like if you don't if you don't let me take this time I won't come back
A	it's stupid though like I just
[ANNOTATION]	they are not sure about time	Neutral
C	yeah
A	normally the people that have that much stress in their role are like the sales people who have deadlines and stuff
C	yes
A	and they they
C	I had that
A	they reap the benefit of it
C	I had that
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about stress	Entailment
A	yeah
C	I had that and er it got us our house in
A	yeah
B	mm yeah yeah
C	but I I was paid for it and I got bonuses and everything and it was good money
A	yeah
C	in the early eighties early to mid-eighties
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about eighties	Entailment
A	well that's that's why
A	that's why
C	I had lots of fuel fuel in the car and everything
A	because
C	yeah
B	yeah sales
A	but I think his basic is less than
C	but it's not it's I
A	I think so
B	it seems to be
A	it's a relatively small company
C	right
A	so obviously if anything
B	and he's in there
A	if anything ever
C	yeah
A	happened to the company obviously
C	yes
A	and I think he does a lot of like client-facing stuff so he goes to a lot of presentations meetings
C	yes
A	that kind of stuff but I know his basic's about twenty-three but
B	it's all commission
A	but but with his commission on top he's
C	yeah
A	and he er didn't go to uni or anything like that so it shows it shows that if you're a certain type of person my friend
B	doesn't have GCSE in maths
A	doesn't have a GCSE in maths
C	really?
B	failed it about how many times?
A	she's failed it three times
C	and yet she can do it
A	yeah
B	you know it's talk it's all talk
C	wow
A	if you've
B	she she's got the talk
A	if you've got the right attitude yeah she could sell she could sell anything I genuinely believe that like I've always said if I ever started a business she'd be the first person I hired
C	but does she get repeat but does she get repeat business?
A	yeah
C	does she?
A	she really builds like proper relationships with people
C	wow
A	the people she's got especially her in her magazines they're so random
B	market
A	market yeah oh yeah she'd be the first person I hired
B	she can't she's dyslexic as well
A	oh yeah
B	she can't write an email her emails have to go through her boss
A	he has he has to check every single email
B	she's that bad at at
A	yeah
B	the academic stuff
C	but she's got
B	she can sell
C	mm
B	our our account managers
C	but could you could you
B	our account managers
C	mm mm
B	are rolling in it they are on fucking loaded
C	really?
B	they've got like so much
A	but you have to really be able to like schmooze I've not got it in me I know I haven't
B	no I can't play the game
A	no
B	I can't do that
A	I find it all too cringey
B	cringe yeah
C	could could you for ten years though?
B	no
C	to make money?
B	couldn't do it can't do it but
C	yeah well if it if if it where's
B	he's no he's still there he got
C	mm mm
B	it's the directors resolution office and they deal with all our escalations and shits when the shits hit the fan they are our fast track to get it done
C	but he's so calm all the time
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	he's not
C	yeah
B	but he's a DTPM in there so he does like he he's just below that stage he's on a little bit more but
C	no
B	well
A	I
B	ignore the girl
A	yeah I was kind of
C	oh
A	joking about the girl
B	yeah
A	but yeah he is fairly serious I think
B	he might go there
A	he might go so
B	he wants a change erm
A	I think as well he's the kind of person he like enjoys the social aspects and I think he'd enjoy what
B	he's not
C	yeah
B	he's not enjoying the escalations and the shit that he has to deal with
C	yeah
B	he hated dealing with BT and he doesn't wanna go back to dealing with BT cos he was he was one of our off-net providers like the
C	mm
B	reps but erm yeah he doesn't he doesn't like dealing with the whole having to schmooze customers and to get things done like that
C	right
B	he's not that kind of person he's quite quiet
A	you kind of you have to like get on the wrong kind of the wrong side of some people internally to make them do what you wanna do it's weird but you have to
C	yeah
A	walk this line of being everybody's best friend but also being able to be put enough pressure on people that they do
C	my goodness
A	whatever it is that you wanna do
C	my goodness
A	it's a really weird position
B	you have to be a bit vain as
C	a politician
B	I mean you know a bit of a lad
C	yeah
B	almost
C	oh right yeah
A	yeah so you can kind of tell people to do stuff but they think you're kind of like
B	yeah but you've gotta have the authority
C	bit of a cock
B	and then
C	as you'd call them wouldn't you?
B	no it's not
C	no
B	no not quite
C	not quite? right
B	so he pushed people the wrong way
C	oh right
B	it's a very fine line between
C	yeah
B	schmoozing people
C	yeah
B	and pushing people hard
C	yeah
B	bit of a Jack the Lad almost
C	yeah
B	whereas the DO office is
C	mm mm
B	but yeah very firm erm
C	you've got to work on you've got to
B	but er my mate my mate there erm he is three years younger than us? even no four years younger how old is he? he's two years younger or he's three school years younger three school years younger he just moved onto our quality improvement team
C	mm mm
B	he hasn't got a degree he left he left college with actually really good A Levels but he didn't go to erm
C	mm
B	he didn't got to to uni I think he got As and maybe a B
C	mm mm
B	starting at twenty-nine K
C	wow
B	there's money to be had there and that was like that takes time at twenty-two K and you you will be making more than fifty K if you're a qualified engineer a data engineer
C	would you fancy doing that?
B	yeah you need quite a bit of training erm to be
C	you're up for that though aren't you?
B	yeah potentially erm I know some people are moving to
C	really?
B	Cisco isn't it?
C	well that's no different to what
B	mm
A	I just
[ANNOTATION]	Some people are moving to Cisco	Entailment
B	there's money to be had
A	it's just difficult
B	if I had a degree
A	because I think as soon as you start doing that kind of thing you make your role quite niche
B	yeah
A	so if you ever wanted to move on it would be like oh you're a faults engineer like
B	yeah it's Cisco training so you have to stay technical
C	what
C	oh
[ANNOTATION]	It's easier to get a job in Cisco with a specialisation	Entailment
A	you deal with like
C	oh
B	yeah I'm not
A	or
B	I've got six customers should only should only have one if I wasn't stretched
