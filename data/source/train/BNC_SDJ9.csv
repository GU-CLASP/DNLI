A	where you'd been
B	where I'd been and they they sent me said oh you've got to go and phone this
A	mm so what was the outcome?
B	well nothing I couldn't get any information so
A	your best bet
B	she she said try your local pension centre and that must be in

B	yeah well it's useless doing this I mean it takes so long
A	mm and what do you do you think you can do it then? did you ask them that?

B	mm
A	you know an information email they don't like the phone calls because they have to answer
B	I was on the phone or one phone I persisted and actually I came off the phone and went on rephoned them on Skype cos it was taking so long it took me thirty minutes to get through and then they just said oh you've got to phone this number again
A	is that on that phone?
B	yeah
A	oh my god cos that'll use up a lot of your money
B	well that's what I say after fifteen minutes
A	yeah
B	I thought well this is getting silly so I Skyped I

B	yeah and so I I came off that and went back onto Skype but then she said oh you keep breaking up are you on Skype? and I said yes
A	oh oh oh dear

B	mm
A	you know tax the inspector of taxes and things not good

B	mm
A	walking around I was frozen
B	so do they do they know what the problem was?
A	it had just run the battery down something had run
B	it should it shouldn't do that
A	well I
B	no
A	I don't know but it was really flat and I could hear it as soon as I turned it and it went
B	how's it go?
B	fifth of December?
A	sorry fifth of January part of the door open so I went over and started started shouting hello
B	yeah
B	no
A	no in the do you remember
B	no
A	in the in the
B	mm
A	really popular people used to go oh come on
B	mm
A	she was really really good she looked after her but when her dad who didn't wanna know I think he was just in denial of it all she gave up her whole life really and and did everything everything for her mum and her dad he's eighty-something now but her mum when she died it was about two years ago was younger than
B	oh
A	which is almost unheard of erm because someone from the social services I think looking to cut down on costs that was what it was about said that her mother should not come out of bed it wasn't safe for them to get her out of bed and erm lift her up
B	yeah
A	well the result of that is that eventually she would die from lack of you know moving around and you know the with the organs I suppose go anyway
B	mm
A	you know you know I'll do it nationally it won't be just local anyway eventually they changed their mind and gave back the package for looking after her and erm but when she
B	mm
A	and erm anyway she did win and and did very well out of it but she now erm is an advocate for people who you know have got problems with their
A	really?
B	yeah and she is a
A	no not really
B	erm do you know up
A	mm
B	and next door erm there was a years ago there was a coffee shop a very small coffee shop
A	where?
B	and erm it was run by this woman and her husband and it was their son
A	mm
B	and mine
A	I do remember the name
B	yeah not his daughter's
A	really?
B	yeah and erm anyway erm she er she had an operation just before Christmas er have her pacemaker you know removed
A	really?
B	or replaced
A	removed?
B	removed or replaced
A	oh I was gonna say
B	because apparently the skin the skin was growing over it erm it was the the flesh was forming around it or something so they
A	yeah
B	yeah and
A	mm
B	and he thought he'd he went up to see her and he what he thought for the was for the last time but she's she's still there
A	mm where is she in
B	I don't know I don't know where it is
B	yeah I know I know
A	and they I I'd from what I can gather they can't ever take them out
B	mm
A	because the heart or the muscles will grow around it
B	mm that's right
A	and so you know you'd rip
B	yeah but she's still there
A	oh bless her heart ninety
B	mm
A	that's going some isn't it?
B	mm
A	really great yeah well what about
B	he committed suicide
A	no
B	yeah
A	why?
B	er well his personal situation wasn't great you know he was living in a council house somewhere and er I think you know it's just making ends meet and he
A	oh right
B	erm the
A	mm
B	and he wanted to try and you know look the part and she was scrimp trying to scrimp and scrape and begrudge him this and that and but the greatest er insult was that erm he wasn't allowed to walk her up the aisle
A	oh what?
B	or or at the if it I don't know if it's a church or a civil reception anyway he wasn't allowed to give his daughter away
A	mm
B	and er then another snub came at the reception there was basically er two er groups there was the group where the the love is you know from the the sitcom
A	mm
B	and friends and family er from the other two families and er
A	oh that's stupid
B	yeah I know I know yeah yeah and it really got to him and he he apparently he wrote to the
A	really?
B	yeah was
A	it's sad isn't it?
B	made a stink about it well it is yeah so
A	well it was embarrassing for him obviously
B	I mean er it is in direct contrast to you know the the daughter you said had
A	well yeah
B	and you've got the the
A	gone to her head
B	treated her father
A	yeah lost to the groups
B	and erm he really got uptight and about this and erm when I came over for my sixtieth
A	mm
B	erm the er I I saw him it was in the summer of course and er he we met him
A	oh I vaguely remember you going off to yeah
B	and er I think that's the very last time we saw him and erm yeah and he at that time he was er said he'd got a young Belgian girlfriend and was very happy with that but that fell through and I think that might have precipitated
A	mm
B	the last thing and he hung himself
A	oh god that's dreadful
B	and erm
A	what
B	yeah
A	oh my god
[ANNOTATION]	the person they are talking about died of natural causes	Contradiction
B	you know he was with
A	I don't remember
B	er oh anyway he was and erm he split up from her and then
A	oh my god
B	and this was
A	what?
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a's favourite color is green	Neutral
B	I know but he'd done the same to he'd had
A	oh dear
B	but it's a very complicated relationship
A	oh my god
B	and erm they've both er been good friends and good enemies as well sometimes
A	mm
B	but when he did do that he he felt very bad about it
A	oh my goodness me
B	I know
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b thinks the relationship was not easy	Entailment
A	dodgy dodgy life that isn't it? but I suppose the worse thing is you can't ever get over being rejected by your daughter though can you really?
B	no
A	it must have gone to her head I mean
B	well I mean especially if you've got nobody else
A	mm absolutely yeah
B	and it's erm well I suppose he had his parents although his father is dead now
A	mm
B	but his his mother's still there
A	mm but it's not it's you know that your child you want them to be you know?
B	I know I know it's but it's not uncommon is it? you often hear about family feuds and you know somebody's not speaking to somebody else for years
A	yeah you do I mean everybody has yeah everybody has family problems but usually in that situation if he wasn't gonna be accepted as as
B	mm
A	positionbe accepted and not to go to the wedding you know?
[ANNOTATION]	family problems are extremely uncommon	Contradiction
B	yeah
A	very sad you know if you don't go you don't know what you're missing and what you yeah it's kind of like not you haven't got to face it but to have
B	mm
A	you know? poor man what did he do
B	he was a musician
[ANNOTATION]	they are sad about that man	Entailment
A	really?

B	yeah and and er he was er had a room in some house or something and erm another room was er being used by David Bowie and
A	really?
B	yeah and he used to come in and say hey
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a is blonde	Neutral
A	really?
B	yeah yeah
A	so he was a good musician was he then?
B	er yeah he was yeah and er I think he told me another story about he had the chance to go off to where was it? to Sweden to play with Abba or something
A	mm
B	yeah something like that and er
B	he didn't go for some reason some silly reason but
A	mm
B	but er
A	it sounds like he had chances and missed the chance
B	mm
A	opportunities there
B	mm
A	to be
B	he showed me once one of his albums that he'd made
A	was he good?
B	well I mean he was he's a good musician but the thing is there are so many good musicians
A	mm
B	and
A	the luck of the draw isn't it being in the right place at the right time?
B	it is it is because
A	mm
B	and erm I came to the conclusion over the years and then buskers as well a lot of them
A	yeah yeah
B	were buskers you know? and it's it's not just talent a huge part of it is luck
A	mm
B	just being in the right place at the right time
A	yeah yeah mm mm and contacts
B	oh that yeah
A	and you know contacts and contacts that you know put you in the right place at the right time and it is it's it's er it's erm

A	seventies style his father built those those houses but his you know he's
B	what it gives you is choice
A	yeah it gives you a bit more choice but then quite often you make bad choices I think when you when money's no object you make some very bad choices I mean
B	mm yeah the Falklands
A	well she had lots of money I hope this never gets printed anywhere where she would hear had lots of money afterwards she sued the
B	oh
A	to the you know enough it wasn't full it was obviously not being checked someone had not done their job erm but I think it never made her happy she just she bought houses and put rooms in the roof or put extensions on and loads spent loads of money and then moved on to the next one she never settled never settled erm until basically the money had gone and then she got back down to normal to to reality and you know had to work and but she had a lot of money when she was young but it just couldn't buy her happiness and it couldn't what she was trying to do always was holiday and trying to compensate for what she'd lost really and it you know you can't and er yeah it was very very sad and
B	twenty-six
A	mm?
A	twenty-six yeah
B	good grief
B	what?
B	wow

B	I mean yesterday when after we we erm when we went to
A	yeah

A	good grief
B	yeah
A	a thousand years
B	yeah and it was erm because it was built on the site er of the original Saxon church
A	oh right
B	and which was mentioned in the Doomsday Book
A	good grief
B	yeah and it's a lovely charismatic er church
A	mm
B	very very small and but there was some erm commemorative stones well gravestones I suppose cos they
A	mm
B	were for the person who was laid to rest here
A	mm
B	you know dating back hundreds of years
A	mm
unknown_female	mm?
A	we've been to a few churches
unknown_female	mm
A	and cathedrals
unknown_female	yep
A	we always had this plan is to spend time on our retirement going off for the day to places like that but we never never found the time
B	mm
A	you know thinking about the next test or the tracking of something of students is a really strange feeling did it feel like that to you though when you'd finished?
B	er well yes erm it wasn't
A	did you have a lot of tracking or?
B	no no I didn't do that erm but er it was er very strange and you know when I finished leaving leaving the campus for the last time
A	yeah
B	but I still went back to see a few people but it was er I'd been there seven years you know a bit of a wrench
A	well you imagine how I felt when I had
B	oh wow
A	but actually I didn't feel anything as I walked away
B	yeah?
A	no not at all I think it had run its course you know I'd been there long enough and things were changing erm erm and I wasn't the last one of because there were four of us that worked together for not for the full twenty-five years but two of us that worked for twenty-five years there and one of them was one of my first groups of students and then another one that I'd been at college with she didn't work there that long but there were four of us that knew each other and had came through roughly the same sort of background training and and work experience and erm so we worked together for twenty-five years but one erm my friend that I worked the longest with she erm went she took a year out and went to work in
B	mm
A	and then I can do less hours and still take home the same and that's what I did and I erm I took the opportunity was literally just on they were
A	so I did I went back so I actually worked for
B	mm
A	she had cancer she was forty-something
B	oh yeah yeah
A	just just over forty forty-one or forty-two something like that beautiful girl she was too
B	ninth yeah
A	it was the week after sixteenth
B	mm

B	oh yeah
A	yeah so I mean I I gave up last Easter was my last officially you know my class
B	well it's handy for them isn't it?
A	well yeah and I've had two phone calls one saying erm could you come and take a class tonight?
B	wow
A	I went er yes
B	oh wow
A	to go with when the group go and I
B	were they really?
A	so they could do their lessons yeah and flipcharts and things and they were buying their own stuff cos they couldn't guarantee they'd have it for their lessons
B	wow
A	but erm the college what happened was the college erm when the new principal took over she announced that they were erm I think she said four million in debt or two million in debt two million in debt and there would be redundancies some redundancies so she took over in the January and February and she announced this erm and then a few months later she she said erm actually we're not four million er two million in debt we're in four and it's much more serious than I initially thought and she immediately erm had the finance officer marched off the building and investigated
B	really?
A	yeah and the principal was called in and the finance officer and they were interrogated and the finance officer got sacked with no pension
B	woah
A	and the principal well he'd gone with his money so but I know what happened they they had a massive new state-of-the-art building of one of the erm satellite centres in
B	mm
A	equipment and the materials that you need to set it all up and I think that's and it turned out to be ten million ten million in debt which means it triggers an immediate Ofsted
B	woah
