A	do you think?
A	hi I've got some friends coming to stay I just want to check they're in there
B	yeah
A	one of those ones with a sauna garden
B	well it's quite narrow I mean the thing is though if you think about the adverts for Center Parcs when we were kids it was literally like a cabin isolated in the woods
A	ah I know
[ANNOTATION]	Person A is gonna dance	Contradiction
B	and maybe about a mile down the track there was another cabin isolated in the woods and that's how I imagined it
A	or cycling around a lake and there's no one else there like
B	no exactly
A	and then you just imagine acres and acres of forest that occasionally dotted around little places
B	yeah you might bump into someone every now and then but actually the reality is
A	rather than
B	well you know the reality is it's incredibly crowded it's like a it's a like fucking Butlins
A	but it's for
B	it's one up from Butlins
A	the the cost of it excludes some of the
B	some of the Butlins people but a lot of the Butlins people have in fact got into Center Parcs
A	well they aspire
A	right
B	ah
A	three hours
B	fucking hell we could be in the spa
A	three to seven years old
B	no
A	from twenty-four quid

B	I mean twenty-four quid for three hours
A	nine AM on Sunday morning
B	but they're not gonna
A	let's have a look it says keys so
B	if they're three if it's from three they're going to make you stay
A	well look this is weird cos there's a section here
B	yeah

A	I think this place has got
B	looks bang on bring an adult eighteen years
A	yeah yeah yeah but look that's bring an adult bring a paying adult bring an adult
B	hang on bring a paying adult bring an adult
A	but there's nothing for this section here

A	I'm not saying it means look the
B	hang on let's have a look down here badminton you don't have to bring an adult
A	but look crèche
B	yeah
A	they're not gonna make you bring an adult then are they?
B	no no no
B	yeah but basically what we're saying is do we want to get rid of the kids for three hours? possibly
A	no
B	but listen but maybe they don't have to stay for the full three hours but what what is going to happen is whist we're enjoying ourselves relaxing in the spa they're gonna be filling themselves with chocolate so what we're going to pick up is two children sick but probably probably probably puking maybe pooing
A	yep
A	well they're not gonna they're not just gonna say here's a massive amount of chocolate fill your boots are they?
B	well they might do
A	they have some some duty of care for children
B	I don't know the thing is is it's not their problem is it?
A	thing is the thing is they
B	they can fill them up with shit and then hand them back over
A	the things is we're we're we're erm we're you know we're late on this
A	I'll tell you what we've not had any response back from this erm returning

B	yeah I think so
A	yeah
B	er
A	what do you mean good fun?
B	it took forever

A	I don't I bet I think the kids I mean I dunno chocolate chefs' cabin if they if they cover three years look
B	yeah I mean if if if they if we didn't have to stay and if we could get a place in the spa then we'd be considering it
A	I know I know
B	you know what
A	I really don't I
B	I know but
A	I wasn't looking for things to get rid of them
B	so I was I was erm you know somebody a Zumba was sort of saying I I cos there's Zumbathon on the weekend we're going and I said oh I can't oh I'm going to Center Parcs and they said oh great that'll be lovely I went er

A	yeah yeah yeah yeah
B	seriously you can have a massage and I'll go cheerleading with then
A	perfect but
A	how long?
A	how?
B	listen but you don't need to be a paying adult it's cheaper for us to do tops movie moves
A	do you think there's any do you think it's worth considering? cos like we're not very far away I suppose there's a bit of traffic but we could you know we could stay the Sunday night
B	oh I see what you're saying
A	and then just leave at seven forty-five in the morning let's face it we're up at six or whatever
B	yeah
A	erm and just drop
B	yeah could be a bit weird for them but yeah we can do that yeah yeah yeah
A	be quite be quite fun

B	yeah we certainly could
A	and that way you know we can do all the you know lose a bit of packing or whatever

B	yeah yeah no I mean that that yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	or come here if we make a good run of it cos it's only forty-five minutes
B	yeah yeah and that way we've had your birthday night there
A	it could be traffic so if we allow an hour and a bit
B	yeah we've had your birthday night there then
A	yeah yeah exactly it could be quite fun
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah no it's a good plan that's a good plan
A	rather than feeling like oh we're going home tonight yeah
B	that's a good plan am I going cheerleading?
A	yeah that's a good plan and I'm going for a massage
B	yeah that's a good plan
A	I'd like a rainbow massage
B	mini jet skis three to seven years I mean come on

A	do you see what I mean about the? I mean
B	this is I mean the roller tots
A	oh yeah right
B	do you know what I mean you couldn't take
A	yeah but it's probably in the same area where they do roller disco and all the rest of it so if you're good you can just do it yourself and if you're not then
B	yeah it's really it's really shitty that I can't take her to the roller disco I wanna go to the roller disco
A	well you can
B	but well we just have to lie about her date of birth
A	yeah
B	yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	so you know I I I I doubt I doubt they'll say in the booking process warning you could not go to this
B	okay
A	and
B	six year plus
A	they never really check age
B	minimum feet size junior eight junior eight
A	well she's ten
B	well that's the thing

B	I'll do cheerleading on a Sunday you can have a a massage or whatnot
A	does it say erm adult required for that?
B	yeah
A	cool

B	I mean ten pin bowling should we do ten pin bowling? they liked that
A	yeah
B	forty-five minutes up to four people nineteen quid
A	or whatever
B	yeah exactly
A	payment the cost of it's irrelevant
B	yeah nine thirty AM to ten fifty PM you know I think I think why why don't we do that?
A	yeah I mean I remember
B	yeah absolutely and table tennis tournament it says eight plus years two hours eight pound fifty but I mean we could pay eight pound fifty just to get a table tennis table we can sit them in the corner with some colouring or an Ipad and we can play some table tennis
A	I remember we did
B	cos they had that big games room didn't they?
A	oh yeah we we played table tennis when we were there last time
B	maybe well they have that big games area
A	with erm
B	we had that big games area didn't we?
A	oh know yeah
A	hey look table tennis that's a great idea especially if we bought like tablets and stuff and and they'd probably wanna join in as well
B	yeah they would but at the same time I'd like to not
A	I'd like them not to join in
A	okay so what have we got? we've got bowling table tennis cheerleading
