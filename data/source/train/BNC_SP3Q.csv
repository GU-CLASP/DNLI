B	why not hide from the world?
A	it's too bright though
B	I know
B	oh
B	no it is like
A	on Friday yeah
B	Friday
A	yeah
B	erm
A	oh god
B	yeah just before my
A	yeah I think I've got her
B	is that the
A	she's not weird she's just
B	the clinical woman?
A	well just cos I'm a bit you know I'm a bit of a
B	is she young or is she old?
A	erm
B	or like middle aged?
A	I dunno how old she is really like
B	older than forty?
A	no
B	oh no?
A	no I wouldn't say so
B	okay
A	yeah
B	that's not too bad
A	I mean it might be a different person but I I don't really know
B	I think it is
A	erm I'm trying to think how long
B	okay
A	yeah cos I did
B	mm
A	you have to do that
B	okay
A	yeah
B	god I was gonna say cos I was like mm
B	cos sometimes initial assessments take like an hour
A	no I don't think it will
B	I don't think it will
A	well even if it does you still have time to like
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	anyway I'm fine let's talk about
A	no no I didn't mean it I didn't mean I wasn't silence
B	no?
A	I just like I don't know what to fucking say to be honest like
B	no yeah
A	I'd rather talk about you to be honest
B	hey then if we talk about me it's gonna ignore all of your shit and then
A	I don't care I wanna ignore all my shit
B	it's not gonna happen
B	you shouldn't ignore the shit because purely you want to
A	no but I also care about what
B	I
A	well
B	why?
A	because
B	it's stupid of you to care more about me
B	I'm not a lost
B	I thought I was a lost cause for like
A	you're not you're not a lost cause
B	I don't think you are a lost cause
A	mm
B	despite it you've felt like this for a long time doesn't mean you're
A	mm
B	you know?
A	yeah
B	cos I guess I guess it is easier if say like
B	and you've had a lot of time
A	mm
B	so like not doing is the norm
B	because
A	yeah
B	horrible because you can't do anything
A	I know I I'm really wanted to like
B	oh
A	but it just
B	it's not stupid
A	cos I mean I do think like that and it's fine cos I don't
B	cos it affects it it all affects your brain yeah
A	I know
A	it really does it must do because it's just like
B	cos if you think about it like
A	yeah
B	it's a disability like
A	mm
B	you know?
B	and you have to keep trying
A	yeah
B	which is really horrible isn't it because like?
A	I feel like it's my fault and I don't know whether that is true or not
B	it's not your fault
A	like I really don't any more
B	I mean from the outside
A	I think it is
B	but it's how is it your how is your fault that you feel like this?
A	I don't know because this is just how I am like I've just this is just my personality now it's not even
B	I think you can be a cynical person
B	and be able to get out of bed and be able to feel able to do things I don't think
A	yeah
B	like it might help
A	I mean it was stressful in a different way like it was
B	yeah yeah
A	erm the stakes are a lot higher
B	yeah yeah
A	you know if I get
B	mm
A	you know there's a lot of money involved here and there are a lot of serious
B	oh god
A	important things involved here
B	mm
A	and that did upset me but it didn't
B	do they want you to do really well or do they just want you to do stuff all the time?
B	is that what?
A	they want me to do well up here cos they think I can
B	mm
A	they think I have it in me and I really don't
B	it isn't
A	it
B	cos it's not that you're not capable of getting
A	yeah
B	that isn't
B	and maybe when you actually start getting like proper regular help
A	no but that's just not happening here it's just not happening it's like I
B	mm
B	to actually?
A	no
B	why?
A	well cos
B	mm
A	and that's the problem like
B	oh my god
A	and
B	that's crazy
A	it's just straight back to square one and it's really frustrating
B	oh god
A	and it's like why would you put it at the end of the week you know? it's just fucking stupid
B	leave?
A	to leave
B	yeah
A	and also like
B	what's the sort of thing she asks you to do?
B	mm
A	it's not what I want
B	I think
A	yeah
B	like
A	I feel like I've messed it up way too much I really have done a really good job of fucking stuff up for myself so far
B	and it can still be
A	I don't think it can
B	I think it can
A	I
B	I think it
B	you've not gone to your lectures because you felt depressed
A	yeah
B	they're horrible problems but they're common
A	yeah
B	erm I'm sure a degree level student
A	well that's the point of first year isn't it?
B	mm
A	to be
B	exactly
B	like obviously you've gotta get the forty percent pass mark but I think it allows you a bit of leeway to like
A	yeah
A	and I have this intense fear of just
B	I know
A	thinking it's awful because I just that's what I think like every time I read anything I've ever written I hate it
B	have has it always felt like that?
B	mm
A	that I can't read my own essays I can't do it
B	no same
A	I've never actually read one
B	mm
A	I physically like I
B	tense yeah
A	and I can't look at it
B	mm cos it it
B	you would well not been good enough for it
A	yeah
B	like cos in my head I feel like I'm not good enough but also I've got this other expectation of you can't
B	the good thing is though like
B	I know I've been saying this all along but
A	yeah
B	it's
B	a new
A	yeah
B	cos we have quite a lot of contact like do you feel like you've got quite a lot of contact hours?
A	yeah
B	so
A	and then you also have all the group stuff as well
B	mm
A	it feels like contact hours to me cos you have to go with your group
B	I mean it
A	oh that is annoying yeah
B	the worry about the
B	mm
A	but I mean there's no way around that I can't just stamp my feet and be like I don't wanna do it I can't
B	is this gonna be every week for the whole year?
A	I don't know I don't I think so
B	or at the moment because
A	yeah
B	like you'd expect maybe a few times in the year but not every week I mean that is a big ask
A	yeah
B	I mean
A	yeah
B	with English you don't seem to feel like that like you don't even wanna do it
A	no
B	like do you think there's
A	yeah
B	as in like you'd maybe oh yeah I
A	well this is what I thought English would be
B	be your that'd be your subject yeah
A	yeah that I would be able to
B	mm
A	but it just hasn't happened yet
B	mm
A	for me
B	does your mind
A	and I can't
B	oh yeah
A	and there's nothing else is there?
B	does your mind feel a bit like foggy
A	yeah
B	can't learn?
A	mm
B	because
A	yeah
B	and I think actually medication might help you
A	yeah
B	like you're you're driving through a mist rather than like a thick fog
A	mm
B	like it's still obviously there but it's not as like
A	I'm so glad you get the fog thing cos I
B	yeah oh my god
A	I say that to my sister and my mum and they're like and they just don't get it
B	no
B	but it it it feels like you've just been
B	forty years
B	that is how I feel
A	yeah
B	quite a lot of the time
A	I get that as well
A	yeah
B	and it's horrible and oh
A	I was on
B	okay
A	and then
B	a little row?
A	well not really it was just more of me like just no knowing what to say to her any more
B	mm
A	and like
B	it's not your fault
A	that's why I feel bad about it
B	because
A	you know like these conversations?
B	you you have people that love and that's not your fault
B	you've not done anything to them
A	yeah
B	but you haven't actually done anything wrong
B	and it's because they care and they want you to have the best time and they want the best view
A	I really wish I could just try for them like if I'm not trying for myself
B	yeah
A	I wish I could do it for them but I just don't feel like
B	yeah
B	do you know how I found?
A	yeah
B	I feel like
A	yeah
B	very like my reactions are very kinda like
A	yeah I get that
A	yeah like sometimes when I might do just
B	mm
A	myself
B	mm
A	I just like it's not like I like
B	no
A	it's just I have like no feeling about it
B	mm
A	and I just watch it happen
B	mm?
A	after that
B	it's just a killer isn't it? like it's horrible
A	yeah
B	well don't say that because it's gonna be worse for everyone
B	like don't don't compare
A	that's how that's what it's like
B	I know
B	I know
A	and just
B	I don't think you're self absorbed like even if you were it wouldn't be
A	mm
B	it would be part of the illness but I don't think that's your problem I think you just don't care about anything including yourself
A	yeah
B	mm
A	well as well like if
B	mm
A	I don't leave myself to kind of rot away in my room
B	I mean
A	no
B	function it's
A	no
B	more of your cage you know?
A	mm
B	it's not the
A	yeah
B	and
A	and it's weird cos most of the time I was like well not most of the time but some of the time I'm completely normal and
B	exactly like that
A	think
B	it does feel like you're a fraud
A	yeah
B	that you're not
A	I'm sorry if it makes it difficult to talk about with you cos
[ANNOTATION]	Person A think talking to Person B is not that much easy	Entailment
B	no
A	cos I know that my friend doesn't cos she's had it before and she just doesn't like talking about it any more
B	I mean I can it actually is a relief to me that you can relate to everything that I'm saying
A	yeah
B	because
B	yeah
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Person A think that his friend doesn't feel comfortable to talk with Person B	Entailment
B	and I felt able to do thing
A	yeah
B	and I've been
A	do you think it's the med?
B	no
[ANNOTATION]	Person B is going to dance	Contradiction
A	oh that's good
B	I obviously I think
A	yeah
B	they
A	yeah
B	it cannot be worse by
A	yeah
B	and feel even more of a failure because I'll never know what I actually would've got in the
A	mm
B	train it to work again
A	yeah
B	like see it as
[ANNOTATION]	Person B nit sure about the working in the train again	Neutral
B	it is because there's I think there's a danger of like making yourself do too much
A	yeah
B	but also too little as well like you can
A	yeah
B	which and I think independence when you're depressed can be the most damaging thing you know?
B	oh wow
B	come all the where to
[ANNOTATION]	Person B think that independency could be harmful when you feel overcloud	Neutral
A	that they would actually just come to my room and start like
B	they are
A	cos they just expect you to keep up with your email account every day and it's like I don't
B	I always get really scared like
A	yeah like you know I said that my physics thing wasn't on my timetable my seminar?
[ANNOTATION]	Person A think seminar and doing stuff like this is scary	Neutral
B	yeah
A	it turns out they sent an email round yesterday saying that oh it is actually on I don't know why it's not on the
B	what the physics?
A	the physics seminar
B	I was thinking that
A	and I didn't get that email until like today
B	oh well you shouldn't've known well
A	cos I hadn't looked
B	mm
A	but it's just a pain now cos I'm I've got another absence and
B	are you sure you need attendance for that?
B	what were you gonna use the grand for like accommodation or food for this year just for this year?
A	well just everything it was just for like
B	mm
B	that sucks
A	yeah so if I don't get that I'm gonna be so fucked
B	is there any way you can get?
B	oh you're in
A	well no my my student account's with
B	okay
A	I've got an overdraft
B	do they charge interest for overdraft?
A	but
B	no?
A	no I would be able to use my overdraft but I'd have to pay it off at the end and it would
B	mm
A	yeah I don't know I suppose I could use my overdraft dip in dip into that
B	is it the same with all banks then like all banks?
A	yeah they don't charge interest with student accounts usually
B	student banks?
A	yeah
B	that's really I thought they did
A	and I get I get fourteen hundred overdraft which is pretty decent
B	okay
A	so
B	is this for Coop then?
A	yeah Coop
B	I've not got a student bank account I've just got a normal one
A	have you not?
B	yeah
A	oh my god why not?
B	so I have cos my parents were like don't get a student account
A	we should've done though cos you get you get an overdraft and it's completely free
B	and how long can you have the overdraft for?
A	well it's for this year and then it gets it
B	so I can have one grand overdraft this year?
A	I get fourteen hundred overdraft
B	wow
A	on my current account and
B	okay
A	most accounts do that
B	fourteen grand?
A	well no not fourteen grand like one thousand four hundred
B	oh okay
B	wow okay
A	perhaps they get fourteen grand imagine
A	well you have to
B	three years or
A	when you're in your overdraft you just pay
B	okay
A	but
B	sorted
A	then you just pay it off next year or get a job over summer and that's
B	oh okay so there's no like deadline to the end of this year you have to pay it or something?
A	no no no
B	okay
A	like what you've gone over and it's usually only a couple of quid anyway
B	yeah
A	and then they don't charge you
A	so it's like really good
A	to get an overdraft like it's really
B	mm
A	have trouble with like paying
A	I can't believe you don't have an overdraft
B	no cos my parents are like don't even bother with overdrafts and student accounts but I was like okay
A	really?
B	it's just yeah
A	dips into their overdraft
B	yeah
A	it's just
B	I'll definitely make that on my agenda then to
A	yeah
B	convert it because if my thingy comes through I'll need it
A	yeah I didn't think about it you could use that yeah definitely
B	might be able to do it
A	yeah to like use it for your
B	mm
A	no it's definitely a good idea and then you just pay it back over summer
B	mm
A	and it takes like not very long usually
B	okay
A	to pay it back
B	wow
A	well then you just have
B	and overdraft then
A	and it will just roll over
B	okay
B	right
A	well no no cos I think my sister's actually in overdraft and you just kind of stay in overdraft until you pay it off
B	that's cool
B	that's fair enough then
A	I mean it's yeah it's fair enough like it's if you don't pay it back you just don't
B	I'll look on the
A	mm
B	if it's one thousand four hundred
A	let's have a look
B	let's see
A	you're
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	screw you know what screw your parents
A	what I got mine last year cos you get a free
B	yeah yeah
A	but it's just easier cos what I do I just pay myself a hundred pounds a week
B	oh yeah?
A	like my building society so I know exactly how much money I can spend a week
B	mm
A	then I don't end up spending over
B	right
A	upgrade existing account
B	yeah
A	erm
B	up to two thousand?
A	yeah
B	term one
A	yeah that isn't that? doesn't that mean year?
B	I thought it meant
A	I'm not sure
B	cos I I think cos your loan
B	it
A	oh
B	it is
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah to keep the overdraft you have pay at least seven hundred fifty every six months
B	yeah
A	just by having
B	mm mm
A	yeah
B	three months
A	yeah exactly
B	and how do you undo your student account like how do you stop it being a student account? do you just like change it back?
A	erm I think you just have to ring them up
B	change it back
A	yeah
A	like separate that's what I've got
B	okay
A	quite good because it means that it's like separate so all your student money is separate and you just pay yourself what you get
B	okay
A	like your allowance and then the rest of it's all just in another account and you don't have to worry about it
B	that's really good
A	like automatically like you set up automatic payments to the like the uni and to
B	mm
A	student finance and whatever
B	that's cool
A	and if you did that you might get more overdraft
B	do some people have it all in the same one?
A	I mean yeah yeah some people do yeah
B	mm
A	I dunno cos
B	yeah you've got yours in separate I'm sure that's a good way of doing it actually like
A	I'm sure
B	the way you're doing it
A	I'm sure people do have it in
B	so you have to apply for an overdraft then?
A	erm
B	okay
A	a big kind of thing like it's really easy to get
B	it's not like oh yeah you need this yeah
A	no
B	that's cool
A	I mean
B	that's really cool
A	mm
B	yeah I will I'll change it to
A	to just change it yeah
B	simpler just yeah
A	yeah just sign in and muck about and see what they say
B	cos then I don't have to worry about
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	until you could like pay it back yeah
B	I found that the price of our
A	bloody hell
B	that's what I mean so
A	oh
B	but yeah
A	mm
B	that's looks like a
A	it does
A	I was wanting to go shopping today I was gonna get potatoes and mash and make like
B	oh were you?
A	toad in the hole but I didn't go shopping in the end
B	yeah it's
A	mm
B	I've still got my frigging
A	what?
B	my erm revision Powerpoints
A	oh
B	go through
A	revision for what? have you got another exam?
B	well basically
A	oh yeah I remember you said that
B	to print
A	that's a good idea
B	when I go home so I can
A	are you going home next week?
B	I don't know
A	mm
B	I might go home next week
A	there's still time
B	yeah there is still time
A	go back home?
B	mm
A	yeah
B	or in a way
A	yeah
B	mm
A	mm am I actually gonna make it till then?
B	what at the
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	like cos I could go this week cos I haven't got anything on
B	you could do
A	but then I've gotta hand in essays and stuff so it's like
B	oh
A	mm
B	no yeah
A	but I dunno whether to go to the doctor's and get an
B	you could do you could do that
A	oh I don't know
B	I mean
A	mm
B	you can get a doctor's note
A	mm
B	you'd just be kind of
A	yeah
B	mm
A	and then come back
B	do you feel like
A	no I don't think so but I mean I am aware that I need to make change myself
B	mm
A	like I'm not
B	yeah
A	like so I understand that I have to go and seek help
B	mm
A	and I feel like I've done that to a certain extent
B	which is great
A	I've just kinda missed the appointment like
B	mm
A	which is really annoying cos it's like this week that's everything's happening but
B	if you're still here then?
A	yeah I don't know I'm just talking in terms of like
B	is this
A	yeah
B	right
A	it's just like a little
B	mm
A	it's not an easy thing for you to do
B	no
A	just
B	but when you get out of the routine it is a lot harder like
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah exactly
A	oh I dunno
B	but I I you are hashtag relatable
B	you very much you are even though it's shit for you
A	me too
B	cos you
A	yeah
B	like your head is kinda like on my
A	well it just I think it just shows really that it is an illness
B	that it isn't yeah exactly it's not just like
A	you know it's not it's not in my head
A	cos it's so
B	exactly
A	you know?
B	exactly
A	secondary thing happening
B	and a lot of symptoms of depression are symptoms of laziness and can't be arsed
A	yeah
B	so
A	and that's the problem
B	you know?
A	that's like that's the massive problem with it
B	yeah that's why it's so stigmatised
A	fucking ridiculous
B	too anxious to be lazy
A	yeah
B	sometimes I think I'm calm but I'm not
A	yeah
A	I'm just like bubbling under the surface all the time
B	mm
A	pretty much that I don't get angry
B	mm
B	yeah
A	I don't know
B	just to check that it's happy
A	it's kinda just like a habit it's just
B	sometimes you even play with your phone when you're nervous it's like
A	yeah
B	the equivalent of
A	I'm so awful when I'm nervous I like playing with everything like I was just
B	I used to like draw grids like craaaaa
A	did you?
B	and that's actually quite common actually it's not
A	yeah
B	like yeah
A	no I've head that one my auntie told me about that one
B	if
A	money signs
B	mm
A	that's what I doodle
B	your your priorities
A	yes
B	or is that anxieties over money or?
A	money
B	dreams of money or
A	yeah
B	richness
A	I was reading up a
B	yeah
A	bags and perfume and all of this stuff
B	yeah
A	and she didn't have sex with him
B	yeah
A	she just
B	that's yeah
A	has intellectual
B	they just wanted company they're just lonely and they've got so much money
A	yeah
B	like me seriously me
A	I wanna do that
A	yeah
B	we sat in
A	yeah
B	and
B	or like we'll just
A	can we use that
B	everyone
A	yeah
B	and the thing was last year like there's loads of them like near
A	yeah I bet
B	but here it's like
A	yeah you wouldn't get
B	it's
A	you could go to London
B	you'd get a sugar sheep
A	but they
B	yeah and they can take you on like
B	when you look on their profiles it's crazy like I'm looking for someone who I can treat and travel the world with and it's like
A	yeah it's ridiculous like why would
B	wow
A	well it's very nice of them and
A	if I was more confident I would definitely do it like
B	and some rich people give students loans
A	yeah this one she said she erm he paid off her entire overdraft
B	on websites
A	just straightaway
B	that's crazy
A	I know he just paid it off
B	you could just do that and never speak to them again as harsh as it would be
A	I know exactly and that's what she did she like she just completely cut off from everyone after a month cos she was like right my social life's kind of getting
B	I'm so doing this
A	but it was just such a good month cos she had so much money
B	they buy you presents
A	and she was
B	no
A	like she told her family
B	I mean
A	and it's got
B	no exactly I mean you're doing them a service
A	yeah exactly if they want it
B	like you're in control
A	exactly
B	position like it's not
A	and she didn't feel like ever that she was trapped into it like she felt like she
B	opt out and mm
A	yeah
B	no
A	most of the time
B	that's the thing
A	cos they're old enough and they usually have families as well like they usually have wives and stuff they just want to like talk about their day
B	that's really kinda sad isn't it?
A	it is it's really quite
B	like
A	it's quite tragic really for them
B	they must be so desperate like if they're willing to spend that much on company
A	they must be quite lonely
B	and sure
A	well then but money to them isn't the same thing as what it would be to us like
B	mm
A	cos it's
B	money's probably just money like
A	yeah
B	it comes and goes like the grass and the rain and
A	yeah
B	trees
A	imagine just
B	yeah
A	it's insane
B	like Kardashians have is it
A	mm
B	like four hundred and eighty million?
B	wow
A	kind of admire them though cos they've done it all themselves
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	you know why shouldn't they exploit themselves through reality
A	hundred percent
B	yeah I I I don't have a problem with
A	they're businesswomen
B	Kardashians to be honest like
A	no
B	I don't watch the Kardashians but like
A	no
B	I don't everyone's like oh I hate them I'm like I don't hate them
A	no
B	done nothing wrong
A	they're like the royal family except they've done it all themselves
B	they really are
A	aren't they?
B	they are better than the royal family and that
A	yeah
B	in so many respects
A	they're business people like they've
