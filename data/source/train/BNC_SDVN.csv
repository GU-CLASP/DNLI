A	I'm really impressed
B	it's amazing isn't it?
A	yeah
B	they're not interested in the
A	patterns?
B	yeah
A	oh my goodness
B	well I think so
A	how can they just pick up on patterns without recognising the content? because
B	well they're interested in the language so I guess they'll be looking for
A	verbs or?
B	yeah like modern
A	so the fact that I'm Japanese and erm
B	well that'll be interesting
A	and
B	presumably
A	well should I just er explain myself
B	no no no I I I don't think you need to worry about that I mean
A	mm
A	you know eighteen pounds an hour I mean that's
B	tell me about it anyway
A	okay
B	to our subject and erm
A	yeah yeah sorry
B	so erm
A	yeah
B	but then one of them came back and erm
A	mm
B	and they are doing this big project with Google
A	mm
B	and Google is writing a erm
B	did I tell you?
A	so
B	no
A	but
B	well what they're doing I think
A	mm
B	is
A	mm
B	and then they will probably get a percentage when if it goes to a booking
A	oh I see
B	potentially quite a big
A	oh right
B	but anyway so this is a huge project
A	mm
B	and erm
A	oh fantastic
B	all over the world
A	mm
B	to do this
A	oh wow
B	or last weekend or something
A	yeah
B	and
A	what do you mean the
B	well they do they set like tests for you to see
A	whether you can write
A	oh okay
B	so anyway
A	oh
B	just starting today tomorrow
A	okay fantastic
B	it's all remote so erm but then
A	so that means you know a proper full-time
B	it's a bit of a nightmare and the pay's really bad
A	but it's not?
B	based on the test that I did
A	mm
B	cos I had to write some sample ones and they took me
A	mm
B	and the rate of pay is appalling per hotel it's twelve dollars fifty
A	mm
B	twelve US dollars
A	oh my gosh yeah
B	so anyway so I was like I can't do this it's terrible
A	mm
B	erm and then they came back and like they so I wrote them an email I said look I don't know if I can do this because of the rates
A	mm
B	and then they kinda
A	it's a little bit it's
B	it's actually easier than I thought
A	because you would able you would be able to kind of erm
B	yeah
A	be much quicker
B	you're gonna turn into a robot I've turned into a robot with it
A	mm
B	but erm they're fairly short descriptions actually but the the time it's taken in
A	yeah I see reading through taking in the information correctly
B	anyway it's really boring but
A	and who's gonna check it
B	well the system behind it is that they're
A	well someone's gotta supervise it right?
B	well they have all these editors I mean it's all remote it's all done
A	yeah
B	you we're all working on a Google platform
A	mm
B	and kind of
B	it's an ambient ambient platform
A	yeah
B	meeting in kind of Google Hangouts
A	yeah
B	and everything's like
A	in in the digital realm
B	it's it's all completely in the digital realm
A	mm
B	and then apparently
A	mm
B	and then it goes live and then I think there's random quality control so I might end up looking at somebody else's stuff and having to
A	oh so you so you you are involved in the editing process?
B	apparently I might have to do some of that as well
A	yeah
B	which they're paying me
A	it's better than nothing and better better than proofreading er PHD students you know?
A	it's thirty thousand bloody theses
B	so erm
A	yeah
B	and like rules
A	I just
B	hard yeah
A	yeah
B	I think the only problem with it
A	yeah
B	is that it's gonna it's
A	yeah
B	it's just
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	it's it really is being a robot
A	but on the other hand you would be actually getting to know you know
B	I know but for what purpose?
A	mm no
A	it is it is non-creative
B	yeah
A	compared to what you you normally
B	yeah
A	it is
B	it's terrible
A	but you know what I mean
B	it's soul destroying but on the on the
A	yeah
B	it means
A	yeah
B	I have a guaranteed income
A	yeah
B	and it can be my
A	yeah and that you know I mean I
B	mm
A	you know
B	no
A	at least everything you every hour you spend is actually you know paid
B	yeah
A	you know
B	I don't know I mean I
A	yeah
B	like literally I might
A	well but it's yeah
B	but we'll see
A	yeah it's
B	we'll see
A	mm
B	phone calls about stuff
A	no
B	there is no work
A	yeah
B	a woman
A	mm
B	erm
A	wow
B	and erm
A	mm
B	Turkish woman
A	mm
B	and she's done all the big L'Or√©al stuff and all the big campaigns and blah blah blah she's done all of this
A	oh yeah
B	and
A	yeah
B	been freelancing for
A	oh
B	and she can't get any work either
B	there's no work everybody I'm talking to
A	there's no work in the industry
B	and and then I saw a friend of mine and erm who I used to work with at the Body Shop
A	mm
B	and she does
A	mm
B	packaging design she's
A	you mean theory for no work?
B	yeah she had a really good theory for it and I think she's absolutely right and she
A	yeah
B	there's quite a big pool of freelancers
A	mm
B	and then as the economy improves
A	mm
B	basically people start to recruit these permanent jobs again
A	mm
B	so that's why suddenly there's no
A	oh
B	I
A	mm mm mm mm
B	because
A	mm mm
B	it's happened all year it's nothing to do with the election it's nothing to do with budgets it's
A	mm mm mm mm
B	anyway whatever
A	so it's the
B	I think it's changed yeah I think there is no freelance market any more
A	mm
B	or not enough not enough to actually erm
A	mm
B	living on
A	mm mm mm mm
B	so anyway so that's that so
A	but that's okay because you know you're not looking for a freelance job
A	mm
B	or I I'm gonna have to work on the weekend cos I kind of wanna keep it going if I can
A	mm
B	in that it will see me through the winter
A	yeah I know
B	you know?
A	but it saves you from worrying about you know?
B	I know
A	erm
B	yeah
A	and you know you have the skills to do it
B	yeah
A	anyway
B	it'll be easy for me
A	yeah
B	it really will
A	you're not going to struggle
B	it'll be easy it's just a kind of
B	emotional about it you know I tend to get very emotional about my creativity
A	no
B	you know?
A	no
B	yeah I think photocopying is er
A	Xerox
B	oh was this in Japan?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	next year then America the American embassy
B	yeah
A	but anyway they they needed some people to do
B	yeah
A	and it's one of the most boring jobs ever
B	yeah of course mind numbing
A	and erm
B	how old were you?
A	I was maybe twenty-four? five?
B	mm
A	having worked in architecture this came
B	mm
A	you know which didn't pay
B	it's all about the kind of like you know? I
A	mm
B	it's really got me thinking just about
A	oh yes?
B	about fear
A	who
A	psychologist?
B	yeah kind of yeah and she's a kind of yoga
A	oh
B	she wrote this really interesting
A	so she's so she's a yogi as well?
B	she is but she she's a really
A	I was going to er tell you about this book Emotional Intelligence you know? by a really famous one of the best sellers
B	who is it?
A	I think if I you
A	there is this so my psychiatrist because I had the last session with
A	mm
A	mm
B	I'll look it up
A	but that book really
B	Daniel Goldman yeah? is that him?
A	oh yes yes yes yes
B	mm bookmark that and I'll read it later
A	oh yeah
A	mm
A	mm
B	I
A	mm mm
B	your ego
A	oh yes
B	and er
A	identity yeah
B	and your identity
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	more like the death of the career
A	yeah
B	and the death of identity
A	yeah
B	for
A	mm
B	kind of erm
A	mm mm
B	the death of my
A	mm mm mm mm
B	and this fearing of things
A	yeah
B	I think it's been about that really more than
A	yeah
B	more than
A	yeah
A	mm
B	very worrying
A	mm
B	you know?
A	mm
B	kind of
A	mm
B	you know it's like what what is the kind of? what are you frightened of? why do you think it's gonna kinda annihilate you?
A	mm
B	you know?
A	yes
A	it's it's better I I don't really
B	I think that is a comfort there I think that is one of the great comforts of religion
A	mm
B	is the faith
A	mm
B	that will rescue you come what may
A	mm
B	the rest of us who don't
A	it could be
B	yeah it was that thing of kind of like you know getting older but feeling you're going
A	mm backwards not forwards?
B	yeah but getting older and kind of
A	oh okay so so it's not about wisdom built built up it's more about
A	something else?
B	what do you mean?
A	cos I would associate ageing with wisdom
B	yeah I know but more in a
A	erm
B	kinda material sense of kind of you know you're getting oh it wasn't it wasn't you it was this woman in
A	oh
B	and she was having the same thing that she'd had this kind of very
A	mm
B	successful corporate career
A	mm mm mm
B	because she was unhappy and it was making her ill
A	mm mm mm
B	and then
A	mm mm mm
A	mm
B	you know
A	mm
B	where
A	mm
B	in like kinda mid to late forties you know?
A	mm
B	cos they've
A	mm mm mm
B	so
B	empowered
A	mm mm mm
B	time
A	mm mm mm mm mm
B	and profitable and
A	mm mm mm mm
B	so to kind of feel like you're actually
A	yeah
B	but we're we're brought up
A	yeah
A	mm
B	success right?
A	mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm
B	part yeah you're right
A	but
A	you know
B	I'm not speaking as a mother actually but erm
A	mm
B	yeah yeah
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	that she she exhausted most of her twenties thirties and forties on just child rearing
B	but what? does she? she had an education though does she have a
A	no she didn't finish
B	she didn't?
A	no
B	so she
A	she was in uni she was at university enrolled and
B	oh
A	because she
B	oh
A	and then she had another one
B	yeah yeah
B	and
A	so yes
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	I I can't
A	I mean that is as alienating as
B	I can imagine
A	in a way you know and then suddenly
B	yeah yeah
A	I mean that
B	yeah
A	behind the closed door or
B	no
A	you know like a you know like a
B	these erm you know the two women I met in
A	mm
B	they were I met one of them the other day
A	mm
A	mm
B	I mean we're of the same age group
A	mm
B	they're like forty-five forty-seven
A	mm mm mm mm
B	erm and they're two posh girls so and I I
A	it's in the background? yeah
B	I know from
A	yeah
B	some of the girls there
A	mm
B	but there were some
B	where they were having an education
A	mm
B	but they weren't
A	mm
B	so
A	mm
B	one of them
A	mm
A	mm mm
B	I mean
A	mm
B	and so I think even while she was at uni he was
A	mm
B	er so he would really belong to a generation which didn't believe
A	mm
B	and so
A	mm
B	at
A	oh really?
B	so she yeah this whole thing of like her degree in Italian and French you know she'd ended up being a PA which I thought was a terrible kind of waste you know?
A	really?
B	just quite bizarre and her family are so wealthy
A	mm
B	when her father drove out in his nineteen thirties Rolls Royce to Italy we had this amazing
A	mm
B	journey down the
A	mm
B	so very
A	yeah
B	so
A	mm
B	or rather what they don't say
A	and erm
A	you mean in Switzerland or somewhere like
B	no no I think I well maybe
B	university you know? they were kind of
A	yeah what are those secretarial colleges we hear about?
B	they're they're for upper class kind of erm
A	secretarial? mm
B	well I don't think anyone goes there any more even kind of
A	but I thought that Camilla went
B	Camilla?
A	the
B	Cornwall?
A	yeah
B	well it's exactly the kind of thing she would've done
A	yeah
B	yeah that is a prime example of an upper class woman
B	who would've been sent to secretarial college
A	mm
B	almost like a finishing school
A	yeah
B	you know?
A	yeah
B	of like have a learn a few skills a bit like
A	yeah
B	in the war in case like there was
A	mm mm mm
B	erm but anyway
A	mm mm mm mm mm
B	they'd both gone to erm
A	mm
B	that was it
A	and they're married
B	and then
A	mm mm
B	another woman
A	mm
B	she's forty-seven
A	mm
B	never worked
A	mm
B	apart from
A	mm mm mm mm mm mm mm
B	six months
A	and how is she?
B	well he's gonna pay for everything and like you know
A	yeah?
B	and then other one who's kinda more like my
A	mm
A	oh really?
B	yeah and kinda wants to do her own thing now
A	I think parenthood you know
A	weird
B	it's just so weird and like
A	yeah
A	mm
B	that's where they've spent their life
A	mm
B	and her whole life's been about bringing up her kids and being a a wonderful
A	yeah
B	it's crazy
A	it's crazy but it it you know it happens to some women who marry really young I think
B	it's wow it's it's just yeah
B	yeah yeah
B	but anyway yeah so all these things have kind of you know it's I mean these these are erm
A	but rather do you feel like you
B	yeah maybe
A	you know?
B	oh my god really?
A	only because Mary Archer
B	oh really?
A	yeah
B	oh
B	oh okay
A	so anyway
B	okay?
A	and Jeffrey Archer you know had a
B	yeah yeah
A	he wrote
B	but he was a novelist before he went to prison
A	was he?
B	yeah
B	he's written trashy books for
A	oh really I didn't know
B	they used to have these famous
A	yeah
B	his shepherd's pie parties were really famous
A	oh I see but anyway
A	yeah you're very lucky you can write
B	yeah I guess so
A	yeah
B	although it's just like so many things these days you know when I I studied languages
A	mm
B	my headmistress thought languages were really good and so did my mother
A	mm
B	it's like you could have a career in languages but the reality is
A	mm
B	like language a foreign language now
A	mm
B	is only useful
A	mm
B	it's not as a primary
A	mm
B	interpreter
A	mm mm
B	or translator
B	just insane
A	mm
A	it reminds me of best
B	yeah
A	who is a saxophonist
B	yeah
B	I mean
B	so we know that musicians make
A	and he you know he er did his album
B	yeah
A	and you know in
B	that doesn't mean anything unless you sell loads of
A	but then he but then he's half French you know so
B	I dunno
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A says that that person is half French	Entailment
A	so you
B	I know that's the problem
A	you know
B	that's the problem
A	paid jobs you know it's just
B	that is the problem
A	it's just going to be you know
B	I know
A	you know do
B	I know and I'm like
[ANNOTATION]	The two speakers are talking about paid jobs	Entailment
B	it's so true but I mean this whole thing has just been like such a journey of like discovery you know but in a really bad way I've been like oh my god this is so awful
B	yeah it's just been like I can't believe how much people get paid and people with skills like language skills you know like how can this be so badly paid?
A	yeah
B	it's terrible
A	yeah
B	and that you know Google?
A	mm
B	in you know in in algorithms
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A hasn't heard of Google before	Contradiction
A	problem is that people like the
B	a generic solution?
A	yeah so algorithm to to you know which can cater million million of cases
B	right
A	you are actually saving a lot of money
B	yeah
A	almost artificial intelligence
B	yeah yeah
A	to erm
B	yeah yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A is talking about a form of artificial intelligence	Entailment
A	you know and that's more like
B	but
A	any any
B	don't you think though the IT industry is kind of decimating everybody every other industry
B	oh
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B is talking about the IT industry	Entailment
A	designers
B	it's so grim and just
A	but you know but there there there has been some publications on what artificial intelligence cannot do and then what humans can do
B	yeah yeah
A	and the difference is clearly say
B	yeah
A	artists
B	no
A	it's rather
B	yeah
B	you know what I
B	more and more I think that cake making is the only solution
A	yeah
B	so
A	yeah it can you know the H√§agen
B	it's not even hard
A	no it can get really hard
B	okay let's give it five minutes
A	yeah
A	it was from the spoon
B	it's what?
A	spoon couldn't actually er scoop it
B	yeah
A	because it's
B	delicious ice
A	mm
B	cream

B	and it was just and it just looked really awful like everything about them was awful
A	mm mm
A	I can just picture it somehow
B	it's just so awful you know the cut of it
A	that's how I imagine a tailor
B	the cut and the colour and everything
A	yeah
A	mm
B	so erm
A	so it was done sort of like er a a
B	yeah yeah

B	this man's a man of so few words
B	it's just crazy
A	yeah
B	well he said to me then he said to me
A	depends how much they pay how much hours how many hours?
B	so we sat we sat there looking at this website
A	this stuff?
B	all this stuff
A	what is SEO?
B	search engine optimisation
A	oh right
B	so he had all these pages which were not even accessible from the main site
A	mm
B	they were all buried
A	yeah
B	so he'd had like an SEO person five years ago
A	I'm not following
B	can you believe it?
A	yeah I mean he only looked for something
B	it is just you know
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	and I'm like
A	is that what happens in a small team
B	tell me more
A	that's what happens isn't it when you get involved with a small team sort of you know a a a
B	like just
A	family kind of run
B	completely
A	business
B	work
A	you need
B	I don't work with people at this level I mean I know it sounds really awful but I do kinda work with private
A	no

B	you know
B	keep it updated and
A	yeah
B	they don't wanna do that though he just wants a Wordpress
A	yeah having
B	but it's so funny cos you kinda think you know apart from the
B	and he just sort of looked at me really manically I mean obviously doesn't have a clue
B	and anyway
A	so you you
B	put the thought in his head?
A	yes you have no brief you have you no
A	yeah I mean you know
B	but I was like why do you wanna rewrite it? I was like tell me why? and he's like
A	wanna see something better than like they've got right now
B	yeah yeah but I mean he couldn't give me any
A	mm
B	he couldn't give me one single thing
A	yeah I think you know
B	it was the most bizarre briefing session I've ever had in this
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	some kind of like
A	oh dear
B	before I even like
A	yeah
B	you know it's just just don't
A	mm
B	and he said oh well you know maybe we should do that maybe we should print everything off and have a look at it I'm like
B	it was like the most bizarre meeting I've
A	yeah
B	it was the most bizarre meeting I was just like oh
A	right oh you know
B	what a waste of time?
A	yeah
B	but you know I wouldn't be surprised if they come back to me because they originally came to me
B	no
A	mm
B	and I went down and she said oh er he's in the boardroom and she was about ten you know?
A	oh my goodness
B	and erm
A	no

A	mm
B	baby?
A	do you think she needs her own space? maybe erm
B	I don't know maybe she's she seems a little bit kind of
A	yeah I'm not surprised because you know
B	better put her on the bed
A	mm
B	made some for her
A	mm
B	very strange I mean lying in her litter box is so weird
A	yeah
B	yeah I know
A	mm
B	and erm
A	oh yeah oh gosh
A	mm
B	he was like oh yeah
B	come on sweetie we're gonna put you on the bed come on baby

A	yeah
B	well this
A	yeah
B	honey?
A	mm
B	erm
A	mm
B	and erm

A	oh yeah yeah yeah
B	engagement rings and stuff like that
A	yeah
B	and er
A	yeah
B	you know and then they'd order them or whatever
A	mm
B	but I mean he was a really young guy he was nineteen and in the end I did the stuff for them and they never corrected a word and they paid me quite quickly
A	oh wow
B	and it was all painless
A	wow
B	and that and then I looked at the stuff and it'd all gone live and they put it all up
A	it's so so
B	yes it was kind of proper work you know
A	yeah that's good yeah
B	and I kind of
A	mm

A	what about travel writing that you you mentioned?
B	mm?
A	yeah I don't
B	it just do you know it pays really badly
A	oh I see
B	and I know this because I've done some
A	oh I see
B	fifty quid a day
A	oh my god
B	when you factor in the time that you
A	mm
B	divided and the time it takes to write divided by the money that you're paid
A	mm
B	you're looking at something erm
A	yeah
B	but erm
A	okay
B	unfortunately that is kind of erm
A	yeah
B	I mean you get to stay in some great places
A	mm
B	but
A	mm mm mm
B	freelance
B	but I did my little travel folio which and I need to send it out to a few people

A	mm
B	but I
A	mm
B	but erm
A	mm it's nice to have Ipad mm
B	erm
A	Ipad can I?
B	yeah
A	mm
B	it's kind of useful actually I'm starting to use it as erm
A	mm mm
B	but
A	oh yes
B	mm
A	you mean
B	mm
B	so it saves in pages which then
A	mm
B	so it's actually okay I've been doing quite just like diary typing to just kind of get erm
A	bad right I've seen it yes
B	I'll show you it have you seen it?
B	it's not bad actually it's fine
A	mm
B	well I wouldn't advise getting it
A	yeah just
A	mm
B	you know I got mine from John Lewis where they have the erm
A	cupboard upstairs? what do you mean cupboard upstairs?
A	what?
A	oh yes?
B	well you don't have a home at the moment so it's not of interest but
A	yes
B	and on the cards are like pictures of things like washing machine and cookers and
A	I mean I go to John Lewis well I've never seen these things
B	yeah but it's cos you're not shopping for white goods but anyway when you are shopping for white goods
A	what's white goods?
B	white goods
A	oh I see white goods oh
B	so they have all the stuff there that you can buy and it's all
A	mm
B	kind of
A	oh yes
A	mm
B	where they have things like
A	maybe ex-displays
B	it it might be ex-display
A	oh
B	it could've been bought as a gift and returned
A	oh right
B	erm
A	mm
B	because it was one of these things
A	mm
A	mm
B	they test it's all fine
A	yeah I mean you know
B	oh yeah
A	sells anything I mean erm
B	but it is quite addictive just for kind of like I
A	mm
A	mm
B	cos I've just thought you can't do anything with it but now there are more and more
A	especially with the key key key erm type board I guess
B	yeah
B	it's it is a consumer toy
B	is he?
A	mm
B	why?
A	er so
B	oh you want that for that?
A	yeah
B	that's good
A	but old one
B	yeah
A	yeah
A	you mean
B	no an old Ipad
A	oh I see
B	I don't think it will erm
A	oh you mean you don't update it?
B	it's got inbuilt obsolescence so it will not run
A	oh
B	well you can but I
A	yeah
B	I couldn't update it any more
A	oh
B	it is outrageous for something that's four hundred pounds
A	that's absolutely outrageous
B	yeah
A	I mean should you shouldn't you take it to the App Store? I mean I've never heard of
B	what do you mean?
A	that
B	yeah it's deliberate
A	but that doesn't happen with laptop or Iphones?
B	no but
A	no you can update it
B	I know but you can't run half the stuff on it
A	oh yeah yeah
B	then you can't
A	yeah I mean I that's the stage my phone is yeah
B	yeah you can't run anything on it any more
A	mm
B	but erm
A	I know but I'm just saying it's so useful
B	it's useful for kind of not doing anything
B	I do I read a lot of crap on it and I watch a lot of yoga videos
A	no I'm talking about documents here lots of PDFs papers
B	yeah
A	cos I have all my data in in in in digital files
B	I know but it's not it's not a good way to store them either I mean
A	no because I have the old you know the
B	mm
A	and then access my you know journal papers
B	but you can't connect anything to that
A	can you not?
A	because
B	well you can get an app you can get a Dropbox app but you can't put a hard
A	yeah
B	disk
A	no so erm
B	yeah
A	yeah
A	mm
A	same as phone Iphone
B	it's not
A	really?
B	well it's only now it's only recently allowed you to put PDFs on there but
A	really? that's outrageous
B	well no no no but for example
A	cos I can
B	no you can PDFs you can but
A	mm
B	in in your drive
A	well that's annoying
B	so I can only put all the PDFs on the upper level of it
A	mm
B	and then
A	mm
B	but then
A	mm
B	or they convert it to page
A	mm
B	and then if I
A	mm
B	it will convert it to Word
A	mm
B	or I can open it in Word
A	mm
B	right?
A	mm
B	but as a filing system
A	yeah but we're talking about you know I I you know I'm seeing this as an upgrade from the Iphone so you know everything is there
B	don't get me wrong I mean I I love it I absolutely love using it and
A	I know
B	and they are you know it is really kind of like
A	yeah
B	it's really addictive
A	I can imagine
B	in a way that laptops are not addictive because
A	yeah
B	so you shut them down
A	mm
B	whereas with that thing
A	yeah
B	it's really bad like that
