A	so hello again
A	more coffee
B	oh
A	and I wonder would we get a better recording if we put it towards the wall? possibly not
B	I have no idea
A	me either so let's not chance it right
B	not chance it we're on
A	oh
B	a coffee tour of the city
A	I know
B	in which they've got like a whole booze selection up there I've never been in here before
A	mm
B	but I know that they have a caf√© here and they have lots of bakeries in the area and it's named after this well the surname of the people who own the company
A	ah
B	so they specialise in cakes obviously and bread but a huge alcohol selection
A	mm
B	lots of whisky looking things and then
A	and I think the prices are very reasonable so it's probably more where locals come than where tourists come
B	yeah
A	and I suppose we're a little bit off the beaten track and by the windows and the general appearance of the place from outside you do really need to stick your head in the door to know what they do
B	mm hm yeah I think it's built on reputation as well because I've always as ever like what
A	mm
B	erm
A	it's good coffee's good
B	looks nice
A	mm I'm very impressed with their price of their set menu
B	mm hm
A	three quid for all that it's very good
B	yeah hugely overpriced in that place where we were the other day
A	mm but I suppose ski resort peak season
B	yeah I know
A	they can get away with I know
B	can I use your spoon please? seeing as I threw mine on the floor and then abandoned it
A	oh yes help yourself
B	yeah they need to get their money where they can for sure
A	yeah you know rent rates insurance all the rest is due
B	mm hm
A	even though they're paying every day
B	mm hm
A	you've licked it now
B	oh sorry did you want it?
A	no it's alright I was just thinking well I might want to lick my froth
B	no you can't
A	well I could but
B	sorry about that I was on autopilot
A	yeah it's alright not at all
B	yeah nice
A	so I'm pleased I got a wedding card anyway so
B	yes
A	I wonder if the magnets in the magnetised bookmarks that I've got to send as well will set off any alarms in I don't know some sort of
B	no
A	oh actually no they won't oh
B	your letters will probably just get stuck to some kind of machinery
A	yeah probably
B	the inside of the cargo thing
A	oh no
B	and they'll never reach their destination
A	the inside of the post box oh shit
A	oh I can see the downside of posting magnetic bookmarks now
A	oh well oops no and I just thought as well erm
B	mm hm
A	so yes put it in a plane if the plane's going that way anyway but the Netherlands? I don't know there's probably all sorts of rail transport the rail network seems pretty efficient
B	yeah you can probably get there in ten hours on a
A	yeah not that I'm hand delivering it no no no
B	I don't really really don't know
A	no I can tell you exactly actually cos I timed it by AA route planner the other day
B	aha
A	I think it was something like six and a half hours to Berlin and then another five and a half to
B	mm hm
A	so that's twelve hours but that's nearer eighteen van hours so
B	yeah true
A	and actually probably from
B	nice
A	things like that erm and so I met her for the first time when I moved to Poland and stayed at her house for a few nights
B	nice
A	and we got on really well so in the reverse trip I'm gonna stay a few nights again
B	mm hm
A	and she suggested that
B	nice
A	so I got to meet all of these Dutch hippies from a hippy group that I'd been chatting to online for years had never met them and then we all met for lunch
B	that's so nice
A	and it was really wonderful
B	aha
A	erm but one of the the fellow tree huggers
B	mm hm
A	in life and I suspect for me it's moving from organic farm to organic farm meeting people growing vegetables engaging in eco-building projects blah blah blah because I'm really excited about doing that
B	mm hm
A	erm for
B	nice
A	bake bread for her guests and generally nurture people and make sure they have a wonderful time and enjoy the the country and she's been doing that for a couple of years now and loves it erm so me and

B	nice
A	erm but
B	oh balls

B	yeah that's great but sad
A	I'm really pleased it's working but yeah but sorry that I don't get to stay there
B	mm hm
A	but maybe we'll take a detour and go visit with her and
B	yeah
A	get coffee and cake or something
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	and then go on to Rotterdam so
B	oh good plan good plan
A	yeah it's good so it's all happening
B	mm hm
A	I was quite excited planning all of that yesterday
B	mm hm
A	and then I'll end up in
B	mm hm
A	and that's just a stupid amount of money so I might just leave the van at my uncle's and get a plane from Stansted to Belfast stay in Northern Ireland for a little while while I'm there get on a plane from Belfast to Barcelona with
B	mm mm hm
A	erm yeah
B	see it's all sorted
A	nearly it's working out anyway
B	good for you good for you
A	I'm kind of doing that for April though when the weather is good and I can
B	mm hm
A	start farming and learning
B	yeah
A	because I wanna start in Poland
B	mm hm
A	so I know what you mean
B	when you feel kind of horribly guilty saying you know I'm wishing away the next
A	mm
B	five months to sort of do the next exciting thing and but I'm you know trying to make the most of the time in times of
A	mm
B	you know to a good level in lots of different ways especially teaching you know that's sort of
A	mm hm
B	my number one priority
A	yeah
B	after sort of you know brain and body
A	but you are doing an awful lot even if you are you know technically speaking waiting
B	mm hm
A	every now moment is still filled
B	yeah exactly
A	you know you're learning Spanish which is
B	yeah
A	part of your breadcrumb trail towards being a teacher in Spain
B	yeah exactly
A	you are teaching which is part of your breadcrumb trail
B	mm hm
A	to being a teacher in Spain
B	yeah so it's all mounting up erm
A	yeah
B	and I'm really excited erm
A	that's brilliant
B	for
A	follow your bliss
B	yeah so
A	yeah
B	my mum said do you want to
A	mm hm
B	she's learning Spanish as well she says she's learning Spanish like she
A	who's this your mother? yeah
B	she sort of my mum yeah she did A level Spanish like twenty years ago thirty years ago erm
A	that's a pretty high level that's gonna start come flooding back
B	I know and er
A	mm
B	yeah or like the Macarena er I think you could actually speak Spanish
A	yeah
B	erm
A	do you think you'll go for a few nights?
B	yeah it would be really nice in June or the beginning of July I think it'll be too hot for me
B	mm
A	erm and really you know I'm excited to go to Spain but I don't want to be in Spain in the summer
A	yeah
B	cos I'm not I can I like it hot you know
A	yeah but that's ridiculous yeah
B	but my plan is to not be in Spain
A	mountains?
B	in the summer er I would go to the beach
A	okay
B	erm but if I'm only there September sort of May June I'll be okay
A	mm hm
B	but if I'm there in July August I'm gonna
A	yeah craziness
B	die erm so we'll see anyway but I've never been to Barcelona so maybe
A	yeah
B	visit Barcelona but I think
A	yeah it'll work out
B	mm hm
A	a step at a time
B	yeah
A	breadcrumb trail follow the breadcrumbs stepping stones in the fog
B	yeah it's super exciting though putting all these things
A	follow your bliss
B	into place
A	yeah
B	and I wish you know I don't I was gonna say I wish I was more like
A	yeah
B	whereas I'm putting things into place that are gonna be in nine months
A	yeah
B	you know
A	in your planning yeah
B	there's nothing wrong with sort of forward planning
A	yeah
B	erm and I think I forward plan too much but erm
A	well it's whatever suits you in the moment
B	it's the best for me
A	and I'm sure you are spontaneous at times and that's fine and then over this you don't feel like being spontaneous
B	mm hm yeah
A	so don't just yeah go with how you feel
B	yeah
A	if it feels good great if it doesn't then do something different
B	mm hm yeah
A	yeah
B	kind of always say are you happy?
A	I love that
B	and I have been yeah I'm fine
A	carry on
B	no it's all crap but how can you make it
A	yeah
B	less
A	probably at the moment yeah
B	it's so an internal monologue
A	well there's Father Christmas with a saxophone in the window and it's the end of January
B	mm
A	I love that about Poland I love that all of the festive decorations stay up for forever well until February yeah
B	yeah Santa Claus
A	yeah
B	not bad coffee but quite strong
A	mm
B	I know I need to drink loads of water if I drink coffee
A	yeah
B	because I just get the worst headaches
A	I get so civilised in
B	mm
A	and that's good I like that
B	but I think they don't believe in tap water here
A	yeah I've noticed that it seems to be reasonable quality though
B	I think it's fine
A	yeah I mean mine goes through a Brita filter because it's just so bloody limescaley but in well actually I suppose in terms of you know quality of drinking water it's not like in Northern Ireland it was pretty much
B	mm hm
A	and the water you could taste the quality it was beautiful it didn't have fluoride or chlorine or loads of chemical shit pumped through it like you get in England erm Cambridge because there are absolutely no hills erm
B	mm hm
A	every glass of water you drink has already been pissed seven times
B	mm hm
A	so and it's full of chemicals it's full of fluoride it's really shit water
B	yeah it's the same where I live you can just taste metal
A	yeah
B	yeah we have
A	you've got loads of rain
B	and we've got loads of rain and loads of you know
A	so why does it need to be treated with such nastiness?
B	but it's not very nice yeah I sort of think er and so they were like blind testing water from different parts of the country
A	mm
A	er you know what could you taste and is it different which is your favourite? and the best water in England is in the northeast around Northumberland
A	ah
B	yeah because it's quite hilly
A	yeah
B	but
A	Northern Ireland was just so nice so nice it had a slightly nutty taste to my taste buds but I could almost smell the goodness on it
B	mm hm
A	it was just incredibly good water incredibly good and Cambridge I don't like drinking it but then I refuse to buy plastic petrochemical
B	yeah I don't like buying bottled water
A	bottled stuff
B	erm but you know it's funny if you ask people here
A	yeah
B	you know what's your favourite brand of water?
A	yeah
B	they've all got an opinion
A	everybody's got an opinion I know I noticed that that you know very soon after arriving I asked for some tap water in a restaurant and they looked at me like I was from another planet and said no we don't do that would you like a bottle? well no why would I want
B	mm hm mm hm
A	a bottle? it just seems completely nonsensical
B	yeah
A	and
B	I buy water for the bottle
A	no
B	but they need to probably get a better system
A	yeah part of my degree was on water and they talk about it being liquid gold and the new oil
B	mm hm
A	because I imagine free energy will be available and oil will be redundant in the coming decade or perhaps two erm but water is gonna be the resource already wars over water erm
B	mm hm
A	erm and still wars over oil but those will be coming to a close but yeah wars over water that's erm hopefully gonna get knocked on the head I mean again as technology has developed and free energy should allow for free desalination so everybody should be able to access free water
B	mm hm
A	but I suppose what's made a difference is you know Pepsi Coke Nestle Danone all of those that have made this massive industry by convincing people that tap water is poor quality
B	mm hm
A	so they sell you water which is also tap water
B	mm hm
A	in a plastic bottle
B	yeah unbelievable
A	and pretending it's something health-giving
B	if you look on some of the bottles in the supermarkets here
A	mm
B	erm I can't read what it says obviously but on some there's you know like a picture of erm a mum and a child or a pregnant woman as though this water is specially formulated
A	yeah yeah pregnant women
B	for pregnant women
B	what? why or how?
A	probably be better off with a bottle of Guinness
B	just
A	mm so again I prickle at all of the should or must words
B	aha aha
A	so even when you've just started that sentence with should I went oh no
B	no go on but you know I've not thought about
A	yeah
B	what are the advantages and disadvantages then? if you want it in a sort of CELTA form
A	yeah
B	what are the drawbacks and benefits
A	yeah discuss
B	of swearing in front of your children?
A	do you agree or disagree?
B	er and
A	give reasons
B	partly giving reasons for your answers in forty-five minutes
A	yeah
B	erm
A	yeah
B	mm hm
A	and still does actually he's not he doesn't swear as much as he used to erm
B	mm hm
A	erm
B	mm hm
A	or depth or texture to a conversation
B	I think it's incredibly er patronising
A	it has its place
B	when people say if you swear a lot it's because you don't have a very good vocabulary
A	bollocks
[ANNOTATION]	He swears more in comparison to the past.	Contradiction
B	I think that's complete bollocks I have an excellent vocabulary erm but it er it is more
A	yeah
B	part of language as well as anything else
A	mm
B	er it shows evolution in language it shows where the same words have been used for hundreds of years erm
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Swearing is part of the language.	Entailment
B	it's not like she deliberately didn't swear in front of me she just doesn't swear
A	my dad doesn't swear yeah my dad's the same
B	whereas my dad I think he swears a lot at work because he's around erm other sort of men who swear
A	mm hm
B	who swear a lot erm and I probably swear the most
A	yeah
B	more than both of them put together but you know how there's like a sort of hierarchy of swear words and I know
A	yeah
B	we get as far as bollocks but I won't say shit in front of them
A	yeah yeah and never a cunt shall be given
A	no no
[ANNOTATION]	There's a hierarchy of bad words.	Entailment
B	but I'll go for
A	no
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Both speakers agree.	Entailment
A	yeah it's really interesting
B	I remember being told off for saying knackered when I was about eleven
A	yeah I remember getting told off for that as well
B	and I was like that's a swear word?
A	do you know what that means? go and look it up in the dictionary
B	what does it mean in the dictionary? cos after that I thought well it must be something to do with sex
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B was wondering about a swear word meaning.	Entailment
B	because I know that sex is wrong
A	I think it's too much sex or sex so much sex that you're tired
B	ah so it's fatigue from sex?
A	yeah
B	I thought it was
A	yeah
B	just you know it meant you're
A	just tired generally no
B	worn out yeah
A	I think from sex specifically
B	mm
A	yeah which is nice
B	but no it says
A	that is really interesting and I wonder you know thinking about me personally as well I do feel there's a bit of a gender issue there as well and my generation certainly older I would say it was predominantly men and predominantly working class men
B	mm hm
A	that swore
B	mm hm
A	and I so there's a class issue there and a gender issue there
B	yeah
A	and I think those boundaries have pretty much dissolved for this generation
B	mm hm yes I've got a couple of friends or I knew a couple of people at school cos I would hang out with all of the boys
A	mm
B	erm and a couple of them would you know oh we can't talk about that because
A	what?
B	and the rest of them would just be like
A	it's
B	yeah
B	and going no thank you I'll have a pint like a normal person
A	like a normal person exactly yeah
B	er but it was only sort of a couple of them er and I think that said a lot about the sort of mm girls that they knew or the girls
A	yeah
B	that they hung around with or you know their views and stuff rather than the sort of
A	yeah
B	erm
A	I can remember actually as well being around generally older men who
B	mm hm
A	would swear then notice I was there and say oh you know sorry
B	yeah and apologise
A	and apologise profusely and that was I don't know I mean is that a sexist thing or is that a respect thing as if to say?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	but it is a combination of both of those things
A	very possibly
B	erm I think it's done with good intentions but it's coming from a bad place
A	mm
B	erm but on this er programme there were two mums and one said I swear all the time in front of my kids
A	mm
B	we're not gonna swear at our children but we won't stop ourselves from swearing where we would naturally and the other one said no never er ever at all we've cut it out completely and then they were talking about the impact on the kids and
A	yeah
B	or you know it's funny if people talk about it in the playground
A	yeah
B	and the others they just don't bat an eyelid and they don't have
A	yeah
B	that they shouldn't use it in X Y Z places
A	mm hm
B	erm but they're not sort of taken aback or shocked or
A	yeah
B	erm
A	I wonder if that was the key thing because you know with with swearing of course it is a part of language but there are situations where it's more or less appropriate
B	mm hm
A	a bit like any form of language so
B	I think a lot of people yeah
A	you need to yeah be educating a child as to you know appropriate use of it I guess
B	yeah I think a lot of people think kids are kind of
A	mm
B	but if you say these are bad words erm don't say them in church
A	in front of your granny
B	in front of your grandma unless she swears
A	yeah
B	and then at the end of this programme today loads of grandmas had emailed in and gone I think this is offensive I am a gran
A	yeah
B	stop saying that they can't you can't swear in front of you know
A	oh that's funny
B	mouth's in the gutter and all this stuff erm
A	yeah
B	sort of teaching it as well as any other sort thing rather than saying this is taboo
A	yeah
B	it should never be spoken about in our house
A	I think that's possibly the key to it
B	I mean it's really negative
A	yeah that's possibly the key to it
B	I am twenty-four I've never had a sex ed or sex-based conversation with either of my parents
A	oh my god I have just be grateful you haven't
B	no explanation
A	yeah
B	I think the furthest my mother got was don't come home pregnant
B	and I was only going to the cinema
B	with my boyfriend what do you expect to happen? erm you know but that was
A	yeah
B	you know magazines aimed at teenage girls
A	yeah
B	which is all fine
A	and you do pick all the stuff up from you know your peer group
B	yeah from society
A	and from yeah
B	but you know
A	whatever you surround yourself with
B	mm if and something isn't mentioned or isn't talked about it I think it can make it not necessarily a taboo or worse but
A	it can spark fear in some regards
B	that you have a different relationship with that thing be it swearing
A	yeah
B	be it sex be it periods
A	yeah
A	yeah yeah
B	erm
A	well I think that's a fair summary er yeah er I think what you said about erm educating children in appropriate use or to understand that some people find this offensive some of the time
B	mm hm
A	erm yeah and I I think you're right you can relate it to talking about sex periods death
B	mm hm mm hm
A	that's the last great taboo and people don't talk about death and whenever you don't talk about things like sex or death or whatever it may be that I think is where you are in danger sometimes of people developing fears or developing insecurities or
B	mm hm
A	having a problem or an issue when there doesn't necessarily need to be one
B	mm hm
A	if it's introduced as normal everyday commonplace
B	yeah
A	yeah but with the
B	mm hm
A	explaining
B	my my friend's got a son who's seven er and she's sort of no he's not he's older than that he's nine or ten now and she's sort of er giving him some sort of on and off sex ed
A	mm
B	and he said something to her like er she's a single mum but she said you know did you ever he said did you ever do the humps with dad? and she went well of course and he went were you thin then?
A	whoops
B	so great
A	oh dear in Northern Ireland I have erm there was friends
B	mm hm
A	they got a lot of materials from they you know they have sort of support workers and what have you and they got a lot of stuff emailed to them and I worked in a large organisation at the time so was able to print stuff out for them and you know double-sided leaflets or whatever
B	mm hm
A	so it was
B	mm hm
A	and if you feel like that well you know basically sending him off to his room to go and have a wank and but that's perfectly acceptable but
B	mm hm
A	you know sort of almost setting
B	don't do it at the kitchen table
A	some boundaries for that exactly but not in front of your sister that type of thing so
B	yeah I
A	and he
B	when people do it it's way too late you know
A	yeah yeah and I think he was
B	and that's when people get embarrassed about it
A	yeah
B	because they already know and it's embarrassing for their parents in telling them
A	that's it yeah
B	and they're embarrassed because they already know
A	yeah
B	er and then they have an argument and fall out
A	I think he was about eleven or something like that but
B	yeah it needs to be in primary school
A	yeah much younger mm
B	mm hm
A	something like that? and we had the conversation about periods I actually before that my dad had packed me off to my auntie's to talk to my cousin
B	mm hm
A	I mean what I'm gonna bleed every month how is that possible? I don't die? what? so
B	this is outrageous
A	I know so I think I was about nine or something at the time and I was absolutely horrified and realised afterwards that a girl at school had already started erm but anyway and then at school at ten or eleven there was a video about the sperm and the egg so
B	mm hm
A	you know we learnt about the penis and the vagina and had to draw pictures so I was horrified at parents evening when my dad saw these pictures that I'd drawn
B	the cervix that I've drawn
A	yeah the fallopian tube I remember being sort of quite impressed with my drawing of the fallopian tube at the time but quite mortified when my dad was looking at it red in the face as I was trying to make polite conversation with me about it anyway and then yeah at secondary school we had the same thing again and got free tampons which was a bonus and then my mum who had been long left in the family home by this time
B	mm hm
A	I remember her sitting me down and she said something along the lines of your tits will grow and you'll bleed don't get pregnant here's a Claire Rayner factsheet read it ask me if you've got any questions and that was it oh my god mother no so yeah I was quite mortified because by the time I had all of that from my mother and this gift of a Claire Rayner factsheet which I should have kept but I didn't erm yeah I'd already had all of that other education
B	mm hm
A	about periods and sex from two schools and from my cousin
B	no it was different for me I went for I went to a Catholic primary school where they didn't talk about anything and then I went to a school for girls I mean that's surprisingly very surprisingly and I think very badly they didn't mention anything either
A	wow
B	er until biology lessons in like year ten when everyone had already had sex so it was a bit late
A	whoops
B	er but I didn't know anything about periods er until I started and then my best friend's mum made me a period box and my friend brought it to school the next day
A	oh
B	a shoebox with a book and everything that you need
A	how sweet
B	yeah like a box of chocolates or something
A	I had
B	I just had to carry my period box home on the bus
B	what have you got there?
B	so
A	oh god
B	and my mother never knew that someone else's mother
A	someone else's mother had helped you out
B	yeah
A	with this equipment
B	you know that's the sort of erm
A	oh my god
B	Catholic all-girls school upbringing
A	yeah
B	so I don't know what I'd do if I had a daughter I don't know what I'd do
A	oh you'd tell her everything from the age of two knowing you
B	mm hm
A	yeah
B	it's awful
A	mm I remember bleeding my pants as well and I used to give them to a friend who took them home to wash them for me
B	to wash them yeah
A	oh dear cos you know of course growing up then in my house there was me my dad
B	mm hm
A	and my older brother so how embarrassing so my friend would wash my bloody pants when
B	I've read lots of things erm
A	god I'd forgotten about that
B	there was an article in the Guardian about three years ago and I sometimes go back and read it cos it's quite nice erm and it's talking about when girls first started their periods in their sort of different households and you know if they were brought up by their dads how their dads dealt with it
A	yeah
B	and you know if they were brought up in a sort of this type of family or this type of family or whatever? and it was just really interesting to read and it's you know incredibly difficult for every family and there's
A	yeah
B	no perfect method or there's no exact you know er strategy or steps that you should follow you've just got to do whatever's right and if that's absolutely nothing
A	yeah
B	it's okay
A	yeah
B	it's as okay as saying everything from the word go and sort of always
A	yeah
B	I don't know
A	I've just had another memory which I'd also forgotten and this is bringing up such a lot for me erm I can remember flushing sanitary towels down the loo
B	mm hm
A	and my brother was a trainee plumber by this stage and I remember him unblocking the loo I remember one of my sanitary towels had obviously clogged everything up probably for the whole street I don't know and giving me a stern warning never to put anything down the loo and I knew what he meant and he knew that I knew what he meant but nothing was ever talked about
B	yeah said explicitly
A	that explicitly with my brother older brother yeah how embarrassing so then I used to collect my sanitary towels in a carrier bag in the bottom of my wardrobe
A	and put them out on bin day after my dad had gone to work so my bedroom must have stunk
B	yeah yeah
A	of all of these manky sanitary towels because of course growing up with two fellas there wasn't a bin in the bathroom
B	mm hm mm hm
A	and
B	I hate that I don't understand how boys do that I had to buy a bin for this flat
A	mm me too yeah
B	for the bathroom because the boys it's always been boys who have lived there
A	yeah
B	and I needed a bin er and I just think god and whenever I've stayed at lads' houses where it's all boys in the flat or all boys
A	mm
B	in the house
A	there's a carrier bag hung on a on a drawer
B	into your bin wrapped in a
A	yeah a big wad of loo roll yeah I've done that before as well
B	yeah I go boys I'm gonna have to buy you a bin
A	yeah
B	oh funny very very good
A	yes you see this needs to be part of the education system as well because it's all very well knowing about the mechanics of
B	mm hm
A	okay every month there's gonna be this blood
B	no well I don't know what's going on in there
A	but then and you know you need tampons you need towels you need whatever but then what about the practicalities? you know
B	mm hm
A	it needs to be talked about about everybody can have a bit in their bathroom you know when I'm prime minister
B	by law
A	it's the law exactly yeah
A	so bin in the bathroom definitely and to educate your kids you know
B	you can't flush this down the toilet
A	what yeah don't flush it down the loo your plumber brother will have a fit and then you'll have to have an embarrassing non-conversation with him erm yeah so bin in the bathroom and what do you do with your period pants? I mean I didn't know until I was about twenty-five that you're meant to wash them leave them to soak in cold water a bit of Vanish or whatever and again a good scrub with cold water and then in the washing machine and they're fine
B	I just throw mine away and buy really cheap ones
A	yeah
B	I threw a pair of a pair away yesterday and I was like there is no hope for you
B	especially with my cold rinse washing machine
A	oh
B	I was like
A	yeah but your cold rinse washing machine is probably perfect yeah
B	no I just don't trust I just don't trust it
A	no
B	erm so I just buy really cheap underwear made by some Indian children and then have to sort of
A	yeah
B	dispose
A	slave labour
B	sort of disposable underwear
A	just pretend you're a rock star gigging every night
B	where are you going with this?
A	have you never thought about that? you know if you're like on the road doing a gig in a different town every night
B	I'm going to go to a launderette
A	no you don't go to a launderette so of course you'd throw your pants away
B	yeah
A	that's why I thought everyone would have that assumption and that is just me
B	absolutely no idea what you're talking about
A	okay yeah
B	yeah so erm
A	I've got pants on I've had more than ten years you know
B	but because I only buy cheap underwear
A	mm
B	they've got an expiry date of sort of three months anyway before they start to fall apart when you're wearing them or you know they fade or the stains have just sort of ingrained
A	yeah
B	yeah so I don't really mind because after three months they're probably knackered anyway
A	I should look in Poland actually cos it's I'm starting to realise now I'd forgotten about that my pants do I do generally tend to keep them until they fall apart erm I used to always buy them in Marks and Sparks
B	mm hm
A	but I think Marks and Sparks had that phase where they did great quality stuff and then Primark and all the other cheap
B	mm hm
A	places that use child labour started opening and nobody
B	yeah
A	went to Marks and Sparks
B	and then M and S put their prices down but
A	yeah
B	really cheap quality
A	shit quality
B	yeah
A	so where in the world do you buy good quality decade pants these days? I don't know that you can
B	it doesn't exist decade clothes
A	yeah
B	unfortunately doesn't exist any more
A	oh it does in Berlin I yeah when I was doing proper work erm and teaching et cetera I used to buy all of my blouses in Berlin cos you could get
B	mm hm
A	a hundred percent cotton a good cut a good shape you didn't have to redo all of the sewing on the buttons again because it was already falling apart erm yeah great quality the Germans don't accept any shit so maybe I need to buy pants when I'm in Berlin
B	mm hm
A	mm yeah a good thought okay I'll do that then
B	good and on that note let's go for a wander
A	yes cos the sun's still shining I'll have a wee is the loo here?
B	er I don't know no I think very much sorry about that conversation bye
A	oh yes
B	I don't know what I do
A	I think you need to unlock the thing
B	okay fine
A	and you could call
