C	so you're saying that
A	well there's a
C	mm
A	so if you don't if you're not bothered about somebody at all and you don't think about them they don't mean anything but some people kind of think oh god he's so irritating he's so irritating I don't like him and then people think why do you go on about him all the
C	I cannot wait until
A	I mean yeah as I say there are so there are people that just don't like each other
C	like
A	but it it it's that sort of checking how you feel you just think why am I thinking about them all the time? you know and you think maybe I they're they're not annoying maybe I quite like them
A	so what else happened in your dream? so Horrid Henry had two girls that fancied him?

C	yeah that's when you woke me up
A	you're a weird bunch of kids aren't you?
B	mine was longer though

B	Wednesday today
A	mm? so?
B	I thought it was Tuesday
A	no it was Wednesday so
C	oh right it's called Life in a Circus
A	uhu
C	and there's this boy named Jamie
A	uhu
C	and he had really boring parents
A	an accountant you thought
C	yeah an accountant
A	uhu
C	and the other is like this crazy knitter
A	oh yeah crazy knitter yeah
B	what are you writing?
C	and
A	I'm just making notes so that
C	the circus
A	mm?
B	can I write notes?
C	like has a space for one
A	hang on a minute hang on a minute don't whisper cos we need to hear what you're saying so you're saying can you write notes? no you can just sit and listen for the moment
A	carry on
C	and he
A	right
C	and because Jamie is an only child and doesn't have millions of sisters
A	uhu
C	or brothers or sisters
A	uhu
A	yeah but he doesn't know that
C	and they're like they hear him they see him practicing and hear him practicing but they don't stop him cos they think it's a brilliant idea
A	but he doesn't know that
C	but he doesn't know that
A	mm
C	and they put a CCTV camera in his room
A	mm?
C	to check what how good he's doing and then like give him tips secretly
A	how well he's doing?
C	yeah
A	uhu
C	and when he asks the this is like getting quite deep into the story
A	mm
C	and he asks his mum to knit him some juggling balls
A	cos he cos she knits everything doesn't she?
C	yeah
A	uhu
C	er
A	that's a good idea
C	and then she knits loads of like amazing looking juggling balls and he's like these aren't sad
C	and then he's amazed and practice with doing like all the time he can get
A	uhu
C	at school when he's supposed to be reading toilet
A	yeah
C	to do it
A	uhu
C	and
A	mm
C	so they could take the part and then Jamie was a bit sad that his sad that his parent couldn't get in
A	the parents
C	but
A	which parents couldn't get in?
C	his parents he didn't know they had disguised themselves as other people
A	oh I see okay
C	cos
A	mm
C	apparently her knitting's worth millions
A	that would be cool
B	even though some bits of it it's just
C	and then
A	some bits of it are sad?
C	and
B	yeah
A	uhu
C	not
A	uhu
C	named Elizabeth and she really really hates it
A	mm
C	so she just wants a normal life where like she can practice all the time
A	uhu
C	and then Jamie hears about that and then amazed and er if the parents tell him that who they actually are and then he's
C	that they had to that his dad had to become an accountant and his mum had to be a crazy knitter
C	but then the girl wants to buy
A	a little girl?
C	well not the little girl but a girl wants to like like
A	has she got that money?
C	it's a rich circus
A	mm okay
B	but I've
C	and then
A	hang on
B	wait hold on hold on why are you doing mum's idea when you should be doing your idea? cos mum can write her own
A	we well
C	we just
A	it's a collaboration we're
B	the bit where the girl
A	oh the circus girl wants to have the life yeah
B	joins the circus and the and I just really like
A	well it's
B	cos they don't really make sense if the girl leaves then his parents will switch over then his parents are like
A	no they're gonna have like
C	oh but
B	obviously run away with the circus and
A	no no no they're gonna have half their
B	and go on their own
A	half their life in a circus half their life in normal life
C	yeah and then like
B	what about his parents?
C	they run off too
A	they don't have to run off to the circus they can just join the circus officially can't they?
C	yeah they join the circus officially
C	and then
A	uhu
C	and by the time that happens erm they could sell all the wool for like fifty-six million pounds
C	and then it'll be a normal house have all the furniture
A	uhu
C	because it's very clever because it's very
A	yeah and then?
C	knitted furniture
A	mm
C	and then somebody buys the house for two thousand pounds
A	uhu
C	and then they become a really rich circus and then they can like and all they do is travel around the country and then if they need to they will bring they will back up the tent and do some stuff
B	mm
C	they'll pack up the tent and then they will
A	it's alright it doesn't matter if you haven't got a
C	oh yeah it's just I'm I'm getting ah thinking about little other stuff now
A	well that's good it's good you just your first thoughts
C	yeah but it's my but I but I have in mind engineers
A	oh
C	so they pack up the stuff onto a boat
A	uhu
C	an aeroplane probably would work
A	speak properly
C	so they have a little bit of money they
A	right well
C	they would just become richer and richer
A	right okay anyway so
C	it depends which one gets published
B	I don't want to write my own version of the story it was originally
