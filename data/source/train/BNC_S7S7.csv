B	never get them off
A	that's my fault
B	is it on?
A	yeah I think I'd
B	just not pressed it
A	well I might've done
B	and uh take it  take it  with you everywhere and stuff
A	I'm sorry about that
B	no that's that's fine uh
A	I just saw it blinking out the corner of me eye and I was like whoops
B	yeah so it's like I'm gonna  I'm gonna  find some stuff about uh about Easter but uh first of all I was just going through the Axis Of Evil and uh uh
B	we found out that uh I found out that there wasn't just three in the Axis Of Evil
A	ah I haven't heard this song for ages
B	well the the
A	there's like an it's
B	and uh so they
A	like Yemen? Was Yemen an outpost of?
B	no it's not  it's not  part of the nine
A	I'm surprised
B	the Axis Of  The Axis Of  Evil described by George Bush was Iran Iraq and North Korea uh
A	but Iran haven't done anything
B	it's placed
A	what's Iran done though?
B	uh it's it annoys Israel a lot by by funding um groups like Hezbollah which attacks Israel
A	mhm
B	um it uh it
A	yeah
B	um
A	but they don't know that though surely?
B	and uh it has some nuclear facilities in there I think it
A	yeah
B	but it but it's uh you know people like America and Israel were saying that it was gonna develop nuclear nuclear weapons but I personally don't think even if it had them it would use them uh other than as a  as a as a  a
A	bombs? Yeah
B	um so personally no I I'm not a
A	but you can't tell other people
B	I'm quite anti-war so I'm not in favour of
A	you can't tell other people not to have nuclear weapons if you have nuclear weapons like that's just obvious
B	well yeah I mean obviously America has a very large number of nuclear weapons uh Isreal has a lot of nuclear weapons
A	yeah
B	they have them I mean but
A	yeah
B	it's a very big country
A	really?
B	and and its landmass is very large
A	I never really thought about
B	it's it's yeah cos you've gotta look at it geostrategically like um
A	yeah
B	it's a  it's a  strategically quite an important place
A	I just wish it wasn't so war-torn and like
B	that that that area's in a terrible mess isn't it?
A	but I mean the area I mean
B	well it's it's it's one of the world's oldest continuously inhabited areas isn't it it's part of the cradle of civilization
A	yeah
B	crescent
A	crescent that's what I was trying to say
B	uh
A	yeah
B	the uh the crescent of of destruction or something
A	no I like the crescent of destruction
B	um
A	yeah
B	um that area's really in a big problem with tribal conflict and uh opium in Afghanistan um
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	um Assad from Syria
A	that's like the  that's like the  Championship
B	this is like the Championship
A	yeah
B	was Outposts of Tyranny
A	outposts of Tyranny that sounds like a cocktail
B	that's um
B	it's it's
A	maybe we should put something on that's a bit more like us
B	what what's wrong with? This is Rui Da Silva
A	yeah I know but
B	touch Me from the album Touch Me
A	D'you know what it's
B	no
A	it's from like when I was at school
B	right
A	it reminds us of like going to like Chambers it's this nightclub in Sunderland
B	right
A	like they just actively encouraged underaged people to go in
B	there's some horrible places in Sunderland aren't there?
A	and they used to sell
B	mind you
A	this drink called Red Pig for seventy P
B	yeah
A	oh and it's horrible
B	oh right uh yeah I mean well well I think I suppose that that's just something that that that you know kids do isn't it though they they go through that that phase you know maybe when they're at college or something and they uh they just sort of go round you know
A	yeah
B	and sort of but they're throwing up because
A	but like all of the
B	yeah
A	those Ben Sherman shirts and
B	well that's part of the whole like as as you get from watching Inbetweeners isn't it?
A	and like I would go out full-on dressed up not like now when I just wander down the pub in whatever I happen to be wearing you know
B	oh yeah yeah we we we're quite sort of casual
A	cardigans and
B	how did we get from Axis Of Evil to uh to drinks?
A	sorry I just  I just  asked about
B	no yeah it was cocktails you said  you said  Axis Of Evil? That reminds me of a cocktail
A	no I said it should be a cocktail
B	outposts of Tyranny
A	I'll turn it
B	um whatever you want
A	or should we just leave it? No we're alright we'll just leave it
B	well uh yeah um
A	yeah
B	uh are talking about invading it uh
A	oh excuse me
B	apparently it's it's not um
A	invadable?
B	it's not a place that you could feasibly conquer and hold um you just couldn't couldn't hold it because of the  because of the  mountainousness it was it's really difficult to invade um only a few people have successfully conquered Iran I think
A	yeah
B	um
A	yeah tribes
B	yeah I think uh it's similar to Afghanistan and I think
A	yeah
B	you you really don't have the
A	yeah
B	you might be able to please the city people in Kabul but you can't uh can't you can't tame the uh the tribes very easily
A	no
B	they just just don't like um
A	you can't reach them can you I mean?
B	yeah it's very
B	no I don't
A	you know it goes
B	is it?
A	yeah
B	it's like a different remix of that though isn't it?
A	it's like from nineteen ninety-five or something
B	oh right well I think this is a different remix isn't it? What does that say? Viva
A	listen
B	oh yeah yeah
A	this really reminds us it's it's Freddie Le Grand who apparently
B	it says Feddie in this though
A	yeah Feddie that's what I mean
B	Feddie Le Grand's top fifty dance number ones
A	he's a Dutch  he's a Dutch  dance DJ
B	well that's that's just
A	I dunno if this really classifies as Europop but yes
B	no yeah yeah
A	um but yes I agree
B	euro Euro club
A	yeah
B	but uh
A	so
B	you've been to a Euro club haven't you in Switzerland?
A	I have been to a Euro club it was very unusual
B	oh really? Well uh I I I feel in some ways perhaps I'm too old but I would like to go to a Euro club and uh
A	would you? With a white suit?
B	yeah is it  is it is it  it hasn't died has it?
A	no no
B	yeah so that
A	well we'd just be talking anyway let's be honest
B	yeah I mean uh you know May as well just yeah
A	there were a number of people in like a white like jeans and like a white jacket
B	ah like Miami Vice sort of style?
A	exactly like Miami Vice sort of style
B	kinda that's just like fresh off  fresh off  the yacht
A	in fact that sums up that sums it up very well
B	come off the yacht
A	um actually yes I mean it was in Austria so it was very near Lake Constance you know
B	oh right so you actually went across the border?
A	well it was just like
B	went to the club
A	yeah
B	that's pretty good
A	yeah but it wasn't really it was like it's like us just going down the bottom of the road like
B	did he drive
A	yeah
B	you back?
A	yeah
B	that's a bit strange though
A	yeah I know
B	but like
A	it was like off a junction off a motorway
B	but
A	like you couldn't get there unless you'd driven
B	can you not even you can't even have like more than one drink or something?
A	no no
B	I don't think I could do that sort of thing personally
A	well I did I had more drinks
B	have to get a taxi but like through through through the Alps
A	no no you could like
B	alpine Taxis
A	ski home or something
B	just walk home
A	no it wasn't next to anything
B	it would be a great place to uh to go I think we'd have to go to Austria some time
A	yeah well I mean I didn't really see very much of it I only saw that tiny like tiny bottom corner like that
B	I remember my school saying that they they had their skiing trips to Austria cos they were the friendliest of the uh the nations that uh yeah
A	yeah
B	has it gone I think of um as I was saying about Austria and um Austria and Czech Republic is that  is that  you've gotta think of them kind of as Southeast Germany yeah like
A	Croatia
B	like they are they really are kind of parts of Germany like
A	yeah
B	there were loads of German people in in those you know Course Germany wasn't originally like one single country was it?
A	look Feddie whoever he is
B	but yeah there were loads of German people in there in
A	oh this is a good one
B	oh yeah this is Bonkers uh by
A	this reminds me of when we first moved into our flat in Lancaster
B	yeah I remember you had I know I originally started listening to it actually uh even earlier than that before like it before it was released I think because uh
A	yeah it was cos we went to that thing in Furness
B	I'd never heard of Grime and then there was all sorts of different types like grimecore uh
A	it's because we went to that thing in Furness d'you remember?
B	yeah yeah it was like a drum and bass party
A	and grime grime party
B	so grime is basically a cross between rap and uh rap and drum and bass I suppose
A	yeah
B	this this this isn't grime though this is  this is  really kind of poppy dance isn't it?
A	it reminds me of that like
B	oh yeah when he interviewed yeah Jeremy Paxman interviewed Dizzee Rascal and and addressed him as Mr Rascal which was uh extremely funny I thought uh but it was quite a nice interview I mean I think it went
A	being too naughty?
B	like wasn't that offended by the fact that Paxman was maybe talking down to him
A	yeah
B	um
A	oh yeah I like this bit
B	um
A	yeah
B	um
A	I love those uh Mini Eggs
B	yeah
A	well the Aldi ones are um the Aldi ones are like half-price
B	I've got  I've got  a
A	Jesee Cresee?
B	yeah so he's he's got robes on
A	yeah
B	uh the ones I think he was buried in that sort of shroud he's got like a big golden globe around his head
A	where's the shroud of Turin has he cast that aside? Is it on the picture?
B	he's he's wearing it he's wearing like a shroudy
A	he's wearing it? No but a shroud's like a bag isn't it like is it not the the cloth that they're wrapped in?
B	well he's he's he's wearing a cloth yeah
A	ah right yes he is
B	um
A	what else has he got on his? There'll be loads of symbolism won't there in that?
B	yeah there's a  there's a  sort of angel with wings uh holding um what looks like uh a palm branch
A	thought you were gonna say a pie there
B	no they they didn't really have pies in uh
A	oh Palm Sunday what's that about in it?
B	ah well all all all of the time I've just uh
A	yeah
B	um
A	oh
B	yeah
A	mhm
B	it's considered the uh Christian equivalent of Passover
A	what what are these gesima ones?
B	um Shrove Tuesday Ash Wednesday Clean Monday Lent Great Lent
A	greater Lent?
B	there's a Great Lent as well as the ordinary Lent
A	ah it's obviously better than normal Lent
B	what's
A	right
B	so if I look at Quinquegesima is um the Sunday before Ash Wednesday
A	so when's Ash Wednesday?
B	well simply simply put it's after Pancake Day isn't it?
A	alright so we've had it
B	lent follows doesn't it and then Lent ends um at Easter doesn't it?
A	easter Sunday?
B	Great Lent is um and just to clear up we've got Palm Sunday so if Lent ends at Palm Sunday or if Lent ends at Easter
A	yeah
B	well between what?
A	are they not the same thing?
B	no Palm Sunday's the Sunday before
A	oh
B	easter Sunday
A	ah right
A	what does that mean?
B	uh it's the day it commemorates when Jesus uh rode in rode into Jerusalem on a donkey which didn't have a cross shaved in its back
A	what went down the palm
B	uh like with uh
A	what are the palms about then?
B	he got he rides in he rides into Jerusalem on a donkey
A	ah do they put it down on his feet cos he's tired?
B	they put palm palms um to welcome him in
A	why is the donkey tired?
B	I think it's just a sign of respect
A	ah
B	hold on um I'll I'll read that cos I might be totally wrong but uh
A	which one? Peter and Paul?
B	it's just inside
A	I see
B	our Lent
A	but better
B	um
A	yeah
B	um
A	aha
B	in um Western most Western uh denominations
A	yeah
B	leading up to um
A	what does it say about?
B	easter
A	it's a bit stupid
B	easter comes from
A	maybe we should turn it down a bit
B	I think it's alright
B	some say he resurrected in AD twenty-six
A	hang on
B	yeah
A	I thought it was the next day
B	no AD
A	how old he was you mean?
B	I'm talking about what year it was supposed to have happened
A	like how old he is?
B	well not not his age but the the year it occurred he
A	yeah but it is if we're starting from BC
B	um
A	that means he's twenty-six?
[ANNOTATION]	Person A is gonna dance	Contradiction
B	I don't know if it does I
A	well what else can it mean?
B	not sure
A	well that's
B	but not every church maybe believes that he was born in what we call in AD zero you know what I mean?
A	well I don't even believe he was born full-stop so
B	aD
A	yeah
B	but
A	yeah
B	um
[ANNOTATION]	Person B is going to dance	Contradiction
A	yeah
B	ending with Pentecost Sunday
A	right
B	following the Northern
A	is that why Easter changes then?
B	following the Northern Hemisphere's vernal equinox which is twenty-first of March
A	that's that's why Easter changes its day then?
[ANNOTATION]	Person A is not sure that the reason that Easter change is following the northern	Neutral
B	yeah it's the first Sunday after the full moon following the equinox which is the twenty-first of March
A	clocks forward yeah
B	uh
B	yeah so it it was actually twentieth of March this year
A	right
B	uh
A	nevermind
B	it's the  it's the  tilt of the Earth's access is inclined
A	D'you think I've made that wide enough?
B	it's when we're aligned like we're neither tilting towards or away from the Sun we're like perfectly
[ANNOTATION]	Person B said slope of the Earth's access is oblique	Entailment
A	facing it?
B	um level
A	D'you think these are gonna look stupid?
B	it's possibly bigger than I thought
[ANNOTATION]	Person B is going to dance	Contradiction
A	no it's a pot warmer
B	ah um
A	it's a pot warmer and then it has a loop at the top
B	like I'd have thought like you'd probably just drill a couple of holes in the side of the pot and then tie a string and hang that from a hook
A	but where's the bonniness in that?
B	Bonny?
[ANNOTATION]	Person B is going to have a sandwich	Contradiction
A	where's the beauty in that?
B	yeah but like it's just it's a
A	no no no
B	it isn't beauty
A	but you've gotta make things look
B	um I'm I'm a bit functional you know?
A	well yeah I'm about function too but it may as well
B	oh right
A	there's gotta be something about making it look nice
B	fair enough
A	ah no but I
B	uh because if that's what you
A	appearances aren't important
B	oh yeah I said that didn't I?
B	particularly when choosing girlfriends
A	but it's at least
B	appearances don't
A	I know
B	if you  if you  go only on appearance then you you you're not gonna be happy are you so? Like
A	you're an idiot yeah
B	unless unless unless they're really rich and you just go for money and so that's uh slightly different but then once again that's not appearance that's you've gotta put something you know like money or you know
A	yeah
B	family ties or uh
B	some some other factor like appearance on on its own is is not a great
A	no
B	although it does work I suppose it does work for some people like some people they might think yeah I'm gonna go with this  with this  good person and I'm gonna get children
A	yeah but that's like
B	you know he's got a  he's got a  great pair of eyebrows
A	yeah
B	my children when they're born they're gonna have those black eyebrows
A	but the thing is
B	it's gonna be  it's gonna be  great
A	people who do that are stupid aren't they?
B	well uh I mean you know there's a always a there's there's always an element of uh
A	well of course they are you've gotta live your whole
B	some people just like you know just like um
A	Will you do it? Be a sperm donor?
B	um
A	ah don't be silly
B	that's just
A	I think it's a bit
B	no no I think it's it's it's great I mean if if people want to but but yeah if you look at the way that that sort of culture works I mean it is very appearance and also mental um features as well isn't it? Like they they do the the the the fact of the matter is it's there are a lot of genetic factors in in life aren't there so?
A	oh you mean choosing a sperm donor? Yeah but also you just don't know what which ones are gonna be expressed like it's all very well saying I want someone who's tall dark and handsome and and
B	yeah yeah it it at the  at the  moment it's very hard to predict isn't it? Um
A	well the
B	success of uh
A	I had a friend when I played netball called Hayley who was really like she was a model you know like stupidly good looking
B	yeah
A	and her mom and dad were both like funny looking people
B	oh yeah you're referring to the the Nigella Lawson phenomenon?
A	yeah
B	no
A	well

B	hold on
A	I sort of like can't remember what it was like when before we had a smartphone like

B	uh but it Easter varies between uh March twenty-second
A	mhm

B	oh right so now you're going to into the horror
A	horror sort of sweets are popular anyway those

B	oh no I'm just  I'm just  reading you know
A	I hate all that sort of stuff
B	it's linked to Passover and Exodus from Egypt um
B	um
A	what's she doing carrying that massive heart around?
[ANNOTATION]	The song is very catchy.	Contradiction
B	um they have unleavened bread don't they?
A	at the Passover?
B	yeah and also um at the Communion
A	oh yeah

A	even fatter people?
B	to to some other fat people in in um it's Cyprus I think it was actually or Crete
A	was it? Oh that's right
B	was it Cyprus or Crete?
A	it was Crete
B	and um which is very near Jerusalem actually and uh Israel isn't uh?
A	um
B	and in
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	jerusalem is not in israel	Contradiction
B	um in the traditional cut throat style
A	yeah
B	that's something that I think they do at Passover um in the temple
A	Lamb is tasty
B	the scriptural instructions say the lamb is to be slain between the two evenings
A	like at Christmas I'd much rather have lamb than have  than have  turkey
B	well
A	I know your mam always wants all the trimmings in
B	you can get a leg for if you get a leg for twelve quid in Aldi
A	all the trimmings
B	twelve twelve quid in Aldi you can get a leg of lamb
A	yeah
B	then you gotta  you gotta  do it right though you know you can't just like
A	I know you slow cook it
B	can't just stuff it in the oven and uh hope for the best you know you've gotta like
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a would rather eat lamb for Christmas	Entailment
A	give it some loving care yeah
B	I mean you've gotta prepare them and I mean depending on what sort of thing you would do I suppose
A	yeah with like
B	um
[ANNOTATION]	they are vegan	Contradiction
A	well that
B	um it's just I'm thinking difficult to like  to like  actually slaughter a lamb I thought it
A	ignoring us
B	depends how you do it I suppose doesn't it?
A	do you not just like?
B	Cos
A	no they just cut their throat
B	well yeah no I'm saying that would be harder for me than than than a pellet based you know
[ANNOTATION]	to kill a lamb they cut their belly	Contradiction
A	yeah
B	pellet based method
A	yeah but if you breed lamb
B	sorry I ignored
A	you did yeah
B	what did you say?
A	um
B	right
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a knows someone who breeds lambs	Neutral
A	um something about lambs I can't remember
B	right
B	right so yeah I was just saying
A	ooh
B	it's very popular in uh sort of
A	is there some post?
B	it's a paper
A	ooh what is it?
B	it is the
A	oh what's been happening in the
B	which is the  which is the  uh Liberal Democrat
A	aw
B	uh the Liberal Democrat newspaper
A	thought it was gonna be like
B	there's a picture of uh  of uh  our MP
A	oh what's he doing?
B	is the recorder still going? Is it working?
A	yeah
B	I'll probably uh probably go to the shop in a you know in a bit
A	yeah
B	um
A	which bit? Like is it
B	hold on so the main headline is Libdems deliver
A	oh yeah
B	um good benefits but yeah
A	yeah it's in
B	I was wandering if the Liberal Democrats gonna get quite badly punished in uh the elections
A	well
B	I don't know
A	I think I asked a postal vote for both of us so
B	alright fair enough
A	although I can't really remember
B	ooh there's
A	oh
B	with his he's holding up a little flyer saying worst bus cuts in the country
B	put
A	yeah
B	liberals want to spend the councillors' pay rise money on free youth transport to address the council cuts last year
A	but a hundred grand's not gonna go very far is it?
B	to be spent in on transport to get young people into work
A	yeah
B	sounds quite a good idea to make it free uh
B	they've got a list of proposals that Labour didn't support uh
A	yeah
B	including eighty grand a year investment in youth and community engagement officers
A	right
B	and sixteen grand a year to support
A	what that they didn't improve? I don't understand like
B	I dunno
A	right
A	does it mean the commerce?
B	are they subsidizing um some businesses or or? Cos they were talking about you know Politics is always annoying isn't it cos it's often like
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	another group of people saying um I don't well I don't  I don't  because um I'm a small business and I'm gonna get I'm gonna be put out of business by this big Tesco so you've got like one group of people saying one thing another group of people saying another and it's basically like politics is essentially sort of somehow mediating
A	yeah
B	between them where it is effectively taking sides uh
A	I've nearly finished me uh
B	um maybe compromise uh you know making a compromise but
