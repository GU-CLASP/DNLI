A	it's interesting
B	you're not meant to read what by themselves?
A	these things
B	Emily Dickinson's poems?
A	no these weird translations of them
B	now I'm confused
A	that's because you're quite stupid

A	what
B	sticks
A	together yeah

A	they're sort of like looking past reality
B	yeah
A	you know how people always say that mad people are visionaries and they're the only ones who are
