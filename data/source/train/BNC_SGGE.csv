C	a slow cooker
A	it's a cooker for roasting it or something
C	oh look
A	oh is that a cigar there?
C	mm
A	or a cigarette cigarette gone old
C	erm
A	yeah it's on the side
C	I'm assuming she's fed the animals today

A	will she pop in again does she know you're here?
C	yeah well that's there's only the one key
A	oh is that your paracetamol box?
C	yeah
A	oh right it's not just a coincidence then

A	oh are they cat biscuits? I mean you get dog biscuits too
C	yeah oh perhaps it is dog biscuits
A	I'll have a look
C	well they've got the cat flap and they can go in and out
A	oh yeah
C	as they like
A	of course yeah
C	but they've only had that since she got this last
A	how fresh was that poo on the floor?
C	I dunno
A	they haven't gone hard hard yet
C	no they would have been since
C	it's probably since it's probably only today
A	so the
C	cos er if it it'd been earlier I think
A	mm
C	when we come last time there was a poo in exactly the same place
A	oh was there?
C	mm
C	well I don't think she had these sofas she had leather ones but they weren't these ones
A	no?
C	no
A	they look fairly well used don't they?
C	oh she got them off of
A	oh did she?
C	yeah
A	why did she do that?
C	cos hers are worn even more
A	go away Odey
C	were even more worn
A	oh were they?
C	yeah
A	surprised they just didn't get something that was new go on I've got a tea
C	just tell him no be firm with him and push him down
A	no
C	push him down onto the floor
A	is he not allowed up here? no
C	get down Odey down

A	just turn the T
C	no just turn the
A	TV off
C	that's it
A	that's better isn't it? there we go get comfortable
B	all done
A	for a little while before we drive back to
C	I don't feel the least bit hungry yet
A	no well dad's just had some toast so
B	well it'll be another hour before we eat won't it?
A	probably be hungry in an hour
C	well so what's that no down
A	no
C	he takes notice of me
A	down
C	Odey
A	so you can stay over there
A	funny little animal
C	what's that in the corner it's not fishing rods is it?
A	I don't know there are all kinds of
C	I don't think you would have seen this flooring either
A	no I'm sure she had this done when I visited last
C	no she had carpets
A	no she didn't
C	well the
A	she'd just had it done
C	oh
A	I think they just did it
C	and look the edges still haven't been finished
A	oh
C	see
A	no he does the bulk and then leaves it
C	yeah
A	like me so but did he do the bathroom or did they get someone in to do that?
C	no I think somebody done that well he might have done it
A	I suppose he's capable
C	yeah
A	what is it does he is he an electrician or
C	yeah
A	a plumber an electrician
C	an electrician
A	that's handy isn't it?
C	yeah
A	that's a good trade to have
A	has he always had a similar position? has he worked his way up do you know?
C	I don't know really
C	well he's worked for the council
A	yeah I know that it means he should get an alright pension doesn't it?
C	yeah yeah he should get quite a decent pension
A	but you don't know if he's had any promotions within that?
C	no
A	I imagine you do to a certain extent saying that
C	yeah
A	yeah but he doesn't get paid so much for his
C	so much as what?
A	as an electrician I imagine
C	what does
A	he does he drives around one of the things he does is
C	oh
C	oh
A	might be twenty just above twenty or something
C	well er mine and dad's combined wage never amounted to much
A	no I know it didn't which is I always through
C	but when
A	no well they assess both households and his parents are divorced
C	oh yeah of course
A	so he he was really annoyed about it cos A he'd been living on his own working for a year so he wanted to go independently assessed and for some reason they wouldn't do it they had to assess one of his households and they his parents had just separated so he chose I think his mum and
C	oh
A	so he
C	so have they who had to pay his
A	I mean he paid his tuition
C	from his loans?
A	yeah for his housing and stuff like I do
C	because the
A	oh towards the tuition?
C	yeah
A	cos you were both working?
C	yeah
A	did you?
C	yeah
A	no down
B	get down
A	I didn't
C	yeah
A	I don't remember that
B	stay
C	yeah we did
B	sit
C	the first year you was at uni we had I can't remember how much it was but because our combined wages wasn't a huge amount it was a reduced amount we had to pay
A	okay yeah
C	yeah
A	I know as it went on my tuition got a little less maybe cos once you stopped working once dad stopped working
C	well yeah and I obviously I'm
A	you stopped at some point altogether as well
C	but I mean the first after I finished at erm
A	no yeah exactly
C	it's all like sixty pound a week I think it was in the
A	so I didn't think I I don't think I had to pay too much in tuition at all my loan was mainly for
B	down
A	it was to pay for the rent
B	down
A	and then to pay for
B	sit down there
A	towards living expenses
B	don't
C	yeah
A	it's not really that's the thing in America they have these huge loans and it's because their tuition is so high
C	but our tuition fees are a lot higher now than when you was there
A	a lot higher that's a joke that's an understatement they're disgusting now
C	what are they now?
A	about nine thousand a year
C	and then they went up to three thousand
A	we
C	didn't they?
A	yeah they
C	you just missed that didn't you?
A	did the top up fees yeah
C	yeah
A	but nine er between eight er universities now can charge between nine and up to twelve thousand I think
C	mm
A	that's an expensive degree
C	the Americans
A	and realised how much more money some of the loans the student loans that were
C	no
A	they just grab you by the balls basically
C	I I mean how when you think how it's changed when when
A	I know
C	to university she had grants thrown at her
A	yeah for going and staying in education
C	yeah she didn't and nothing had to be paid back
A	no
C	that's what
A	yeah
C	yet her parents weren't hard up
A	no
C	it wasn't as though she come from a poor background
A	background well she probably wouldn't have got
C	no
A	just cos of your level of education and the attitude of the family
[ANNOTATION]	they are not sure about university	Neutral
C	yeah
A	but yeah it's a shame I guess too many people started to go to
C	like everything
A	yeah wanted everyone to go to university
C	it's like I know it's completely opposite but it's like the care home it it's not a caring profession now it's a business it's there to make money for the
[ANNOTATION]	person C is talking about business	Entailment
A	the owner the profit
C	for the
A	the organisation
C	the organisation that owns it
A	same as

C	yeah
A	that would have been a cheaper wedding
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	and carers there was there were twice the amount of carers that there are now
A	it's cos there there was a point when providing service was providing a good service wasn't it?
C	mm
A	we seem to have become very detached from that in our culture
C	but he must have been able to run it at a profit he couldn't have been losing money on it
