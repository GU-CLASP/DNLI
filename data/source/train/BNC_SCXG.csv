C	well er
A	and hammer nails
D	this is a bottle we opened
B	this is a Pauillac of two thousand and two very nice
D	and I thought that you might not want it

D	yeah or this yeah finish this what's in the
B	oh yeah yeah
D	the bottle and yeah
C	oh yeah hammers and tacks and things
A	yeah
C	and
A	cos I imagined it was a sewing machine job but of course it's not really is it?
C	no no it's not it's it's nothing to do with the sewing machine actually
A	no yeah
C	yeah and erm er yeah it's
A	it's banging nails
C	just a case of dismantling well it's the dismantling it's
A	and knowing where to fold the fabric as well
C	well yes and how you know how to fold it
A	yes exactly
C	because you
A	which is what you must
C	you start you start along one edge
A	yeah
C	er on the upside down and you you spread it out and tack it sort of one two three and then then you pull it really tight
A	yes
C	and bring the other the opposite side up
A	like
C	and tack it
A	a bit like wrapping a present but very very neatly
C	erm in a way actually
A	yes
C	yes you do actually
A	yeah
C	you do that and then you do
A	the folding thing
C	er you do the well I do the sides I do the
A	yes
C	do a sort of tacked took that much towards a corner
A	yeah
C	and then and then I decide how I'm going to play around with that and and then I cut it
A	yes
C	in situ
A	yeah
C	you know to to where I want to trim it
D	now these were the
B	er they sell that make yeah but they do it online
D	you have
A	so
C	yeah
A	really paid dividends
C	yes
A	then didn't it?
C	yes yeah yeah
A	all those years ago cos it
C	cos er I've done I mean I've done I did our dining room ones at
A	yes
C	I mean we we don't have it any longer we sold it
C	when we moved down to number
A	yes yeah
C	but that was more difficult because the seats you couldn't remove they were
A	oh
C	part of it
A	yeah that must be
C	so that er was more challenging I think
A	mm
C	but no I think they look they look yeah yeah
A	that must be quite a fun process actually cos you have all er depending on what you're doing
C	yeah yeah
A	some are more challenging than others and
A	yeah I mean this these sort of things
A	yeah exactly
C	are stitching
A	yes
C	jobs erm
A	well do they
C	you know
A	they must stitch them
C	I mean I never ever
A	when they're
C	ever got onto something like this I wish I had
A	do they stitch them before they've put them on?
C	well they they must stitch things like this cos that's all all stitched and piped so they
A	yeah piping yes
C	obviously take templates and things and
A	yeah
C	and measure that but then these that bit is stitched in situ and
A	oh so it's all
C	you need a very special
A	all about the measuring and
C	a needle yeah yeah
A	shapes and the
C	yeah
A	pattern
C	and the pattern
A	and the yeah
C	yeah
A	mm
C	yeah
A	quite a fine art
D	it's a period piece
A	that chair?
D	yes mm
A	oh
C	mm
A	so far as I know
C	yeah
A	that's
D	well yes
C	she may not want anything back actually
A	yeah
C	when she
B	yeah
A	cos is she going for something different er to her usual style?
C	mm
C	it's looking very modern isn't it?
B	I don't know
C	yeah
A	mm
B	just looks like a municipal hospital
C	what you mean
B	that's what everyone said
A	maybe she likes that look though
C	oh
A	yes
C	you know so it it works to the benefit of of everybody because the people
C	the house that's behind them is actually higher up erm
A	mm
C	but there's quite a big garden
A	yeah
C	to the wall of the walled garden where their place is
A	they are yes
C	so they're not sort of here and there it's not a totally in your face thing
A	uhu
C	but erm if they built it up well when they build it up the
A	mm
C	to see into the garden and things so but
A	mm clever
D	it's a good one
C	yeah
A	mm
D	they've gotta find bloody jobs first before then can
C	yeah
D	do this
A	there's always that
D	fancy business
A	slight inconvenience isn't there?
C	convenience yes
A	that's what I thought
C	new development
C	but they
A	spent it have they?
C	well yes when you think they've been to
A	coming back again
C	by the time they've got back to the UK
D	yeah
A	yeah
C	it it will
A	it's easy to do though isn't it?
C	I mean yeah I mean they've had a fabulous
A	well exactly
C	er thing I mean they go off
A	yeah
C	to Australia in about three weeks' time and then
A	and they it's not like they're gonna have a problem getting a job really cos they've both got
C	no
A	you know careers
C	and you know
A	proper careers
A	yeah he
C	and things so it it
A	he's never gonna have a problem
C	should be alright
A	and neither is
C	yeah
A	so
C	I mean certainly it's something they always wanted to do so and they've actually managed to do it so
A	yes exactly
C	it's so yes so that's
A	one to tick off the list

D	not as much as that I don't the viola might ought to
B	oh

B	well there is I don't play my little ukulele but it looks quite pretty
C	I've gone off it

A	you can play your little ukulele
C	you should you took that quite seriously when you started didn't he?

A	any further
B	it was the song I was working on
A	it got a bit trying
C	did he not practise?
A	he practised the same chords

D	mm
C	and how much were they?
B	where did I put my glass? it's not there
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B is wondering where his/her glass is.	Entailment
C	here? no
D	er
B	she's like dad
D	very
B	we bought that in the same shop on the same day
C	oh that's
B	no
C	oh
B	and we bought one other thing there as well it think
[ANNOTATION]	They bought some plates from that same shop that day	Neutral
D	yes
C	how much were the ducks?
B	I think we oh er
D	I bet
B	and it's one of those antique shops where different vendors display their work
C	oh right erm
[ANNOTATION]	In these antique shops different vendors display their books	Neutral
B	so you can't actually
C	you can't bargain because
B	bargain cos they're not there
C	somebody's selling it on behalf of somebody who isn't there
B	so we got the maximum that they were allowed to take off which was like
C	yeah
B	I dunno five or
[ANNOTATION]	You can bargain in these shops	Contradiction
D	there's a shop in
C	I've got
B	darling I think you took my wine glass away
A	oh
D	where we got the coaster
B	in
C	yes
B	erm
C	it's a huge place
B	no it's
D	no
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B has their wine glass on their hand.	Contradiction
B	a little place just up from the station
C	oh no that's a different we don't know that one
B	around the corner from the station
D	you're thinking of
C	oh right
B	yeah
B	probably not thinking of
C	oh right yes yeah
D	there was a nice little place we found there
C	liked
D	loved them
C	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Tehy do not know the place near the station.	Entailment
D	we may well have bought something
C	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	The place is not small.	Entailment
D	but I don't remember
C	but
B	forty-five quid I think I paid for them
C	forty-five?
B	yeah
C	that seems alright
B	that just rings a bell
C	yeah
D	ah
B	yeah
D	they're metal aren't they?
C	yeah
D	it's a bit
C	that's what makes them very unusual actually
D	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	B paid 100 pounds for them.	Contradiction
C	as I said I meant that cat cats must have a sixth sense because
D	oh
C	why did they pick why did he pick you know number two
[ANNOTATION]	They are metal.	Entailment
C	to hone in on?
C	yeah
D	quite unlike humans
C	quite unlike dogs
D	yeah
C	well I mean and dogs are such a time-consuming beast and you see all those people whatever the weather
D	oh dear yes
[ANNOTATION]	People take their dogs out whatever the weather.	Entailment
C	walking up and down and and
D	oh dear
C	yeah
D	people becoming devoted
C	yeah
D	and of course it's reciprocated so it's a great er
C	yeah
D	or coming back and there was this sight of there's this woman with this cat on a lead
B	oh can I have a glass? did you
A	there
C	what is it they say that quite clever little statement about dogs have
D	what's that little saying?
A	mm
C	you don't talk about what?
B	that
A	the thing we don't talk about
B	what's what what?
A	what's what what what what what what what?
B	mummy?
C	yes thank you
B	what's what?
C	what's what what what?
B	well you said what's that stick or something
A	and you said what's something
C	yes
B	mm
C	oh no yes erm what do they say about dogs and cats?
B	they don't mix
A	er
C	no one have masters and er is a sort of er
A	oh
C	yes you know it implies that you know
A	erm
C	you spend your time looking after a cat
A	well it's the opposite er
A	one's got a master and then the cat is the master
B	the the saying I know is dogs look up to you cats look down at you
B	and pigs look you square in the eye
A	it's something to do with the ownership
C	yes it is it's it's something have masters
A	but dogs
C	and well it must be cats
A	are owned and cats are the ones who own
C	yeah
A	the owner
C	yeah
A	yes but I know
C	yeah
A	the one you mean
C	yeah
A	yeah cats have staff
C	no no dogs oh yes yeah
B	mm
C	it is actually
A	well
B	it'll be something like that
C	dogs
A	no that's that's like mine really but
C	dogs have masters and
B	mm
C	it's like that's
B	if that's not it
C	that's even better actually
B	it very well could be
A	it is quite good
B	that's rather better than the one I'm trying to think of actually
C	well
B	Arsenal
C	Arsenal are doing rather badly
B	were they?
D	mm
B	and they haven't won anything since then?
B	they've won a couple of games
C	yeah
B	they've been knocked out
C	and
B	of two competitions
C	really? so how can they go from being top of the league to being nobody at all?
B	well
C	and
A	good question
B	good question
C	yeah and how's Leicester?
B	they're still top dear
C	to think they I mean that'll be amazing if they go because weren't they on the point of relegation or something?
B	er last year they were yeah
C	yeah
D	what did you think of the erm Welsh English game?
B	terrific
D	yeah another ten minutes and the Wales the Welsh might have won them
B	yeah
D	they left it too late the
C	or conversely if they'd woken up ten minutes earlier
D	well yeah the
C	er in the match they yeah
D	they were run off their feet in the first half really but
C	no
D	that's right
C	cos
D	there's
B	did he?
D	there's devotion
C	yes well I mean he comes over very regularly to see his parents actually but it coincides with a match
D	in Cardiff
C	which is the other end of Wales of where his parents live it must be said but his son lives there so
D	where do they live do you know where it is?
C	no
B	in Wales?
[ANNOTATION]	Cardiff is not at the other side of Wales	Contradiction
C	can't quite no it's in the north of Wales yeah
D	it is yeah
C	yeah
A	what do you think of plans for all schools to become academies
C	well
A	what does it mean exactly?
C	well it it means that they they cease to be under control of the of the local
A	authority
C	county council the local authority actually
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	speaker c goes to school	Neutral
C	they get funded directly by the government so it actually means that each school has more control over how it spends its money
A	oh okay
C	erm
D	I think it's all explained in
C	so
D	in the Independent isn't it?
D	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a is against schools becoming academies	Neutral
C	is it indeed?
A	yeah is that
C	yeah yeah
A	a good thing or a bad thing?
C	erm it very much depends
A	well a double
C	well it depends
A	edged sword then or
A	yeah
C	because some
A	yeah
C	conversely some heads will be very good at handling their own but
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a is the head of a school	Neutral
A	yes
C	but er some heads will be completely at sea
A	mm
C	it'll probably require each school to have much more of a business manager
A	oh yes of course yeah
C	within them erm
A	mm
C	so er you know it's er it's a very sort of sweeping statement
[ANNOTATION]	schools turning into academies means they will need better money management	Entailment
A	I wonder why though
C	they've also they've
A	but do you know what the motive for it is?
C	no
A	they've usually got a motive
[ANNOTATION]	the reason behind this is that now more resources are available	Neutral
C	yeah
A	this government haven't they?
C	they
C	parents at least one parent governor
A	yeah
C	erm and that is no longer a statutory requirement although I actually think it's a very good thing to have a parent governor
A	mm
A	compulsory maths lessons
A	until eighteen
C	the other thing they're suggesting or the
B	crazy
C	is that
A	mm
C	the school day should be extended by an hour so instead of three
A	yeah
C	would go on till four
A	it seems awfully short
C	well I quite agree with you actually
A	yeah
C	yeah I think
B	well it's never factored in when people have the debate about the percentage of privately educated students getting into say Oxbridge as opposed to from erm
C	from a state yeah
A	that they get an extra hour
B	if you go a private school you you've had
A	an extra hour
B	an additional half day Saturday at school
C	yeah yeah
B	every week that you've been at school
A	yeah
C	plus hours for each day
B	plus additional hours
A	so five five hours a week
B	every single day so the sum of your education
C	is twice as long
B	is is vastly
C	yeah longer
B	yeah longer than someone from a state school
A	five times a hundred and fifty-two
B	cos you see state school students I mean you know old A level students wandering home at half three four
C	oh well schools finish at three
B	well
A	yeah
B	we'd be midway through your day
C	yeah exactly
A	yeah
B	you still have two hours or lessons
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	I mean it's that's not rocket science either is it?
C	no
A	the reason why
C	yeah
B	mm it's only one of the reasons there also is obviously an inbuilt institutional
C	expectation
B	institutionalised poshism
A	social reasons
C	well there are
A	oh well no
C	no I think there are also sort of built-in expectations
A	yeah that's the social reasons
C	which and usually erm almost inevitably not necessarily for good reasons but there's far more parental support than in a state school a state school
B	yeah
C	you know there oodles of
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	you know
A	yeah
C	the parental
A	but
C	response
A	yes
B	whereas at my school
C	and of course that was the reason you know why the boy was as far off track as he was actually
A	mm exactly
B	and at my school it's just assumed it's not even a question that
D	hello
B	you go to university after A levels
C	yeah exactly
B	that's why you do A levels
C	yeah yeah
B	cos that determines what university you go to
C	yeah and you tend to come from a parental body
B	and
C	who've been there before you anyway
B	yeah but also no matter what your academic ability that was the assumption
C	yeah yes
B	er the only exceptions were a few people who were going into their parents' business
C	yes yeah
B	but that
C	yeah
B	one percent
C	yeah
B	and I can only think of one one or two people who did that
C	yeah
A	I need to check the potatoes
B	let's just get this flaming again
C	yeah I think yes it's
B	oh it is open that's strange oh so is that
C	mm
B	with the vent and everything
C	I was er
B	uhu
C	so they you know the neighbours who had just moved in were the ones over the road
B	yeah
C	but you've now got them there and next door
B	there's a few they're not particularly noisy they have small child
C	how many are there?
B	dunno
C	no
B	seems to be one family
C	yeah well that's good yeah
B	er fuck knows
C	do they not?
B	so
B	who spoke some English and then took it off the
C	off the street yeah
B	the street it was quite good
C	actually that's that's what you have to do actually really in a sense quite nicely just say to people well actually we don't do that
B	yeah
C	here
B	uhu
C	yeah
B	and tomorrow interestingly is the the department where I accidentally sort of ended up after the merger before I said I'm not doing that job any
C	yeah
B	that whole department has been sent to India outsourced to India
B	and everyone's been laid off including
C	really?
B	well everyone except for the big manager who will now sort of just
C	oh right yeah
B	aye aye
C	gosh
B	so their leaving do is tomorrow and their last day
C	yeah
B	is tomorrow
C	and how is your department doing?
B	uhu
C	and are you enjoying it?
B	yeah
C	yeah and is it cerebrally interesting enough?
B	it's more cerebrally interesting than my last jog
C	oh well that's good
B	you need a good
C	what? oh sorry wait a minute say that again dear
B	you need a good vocabulary and you need to be able to think things through
C	yeah yeah well then you're ideal
B	so it's good yeah
C	yeah
B	yeah that
C	yeah
B	went well
C	yeah any pay rise since?
B	but the new system is that pay rises are linked to your assessment
C	right
B	which is actually just an excuse for not paying people much that if they don't perform up to
C	yeah
C	well
[ANNOTATION]	Person C think is could be not just an excuse	Neutral
B	well my boss my my big boss the company owner just awarded himself a sixty million pound bonus for the year and that's on top of his salary

C	where did he start off?

C	uhu
D	yes
C	I mean the recipe's very
D	mm
C	erm
B	it's the same as fudge it's just the temperature and
C	it's just you you take it up to
A	it's harder
C	a little bit er
A	mm
C	a a little bit higher in temperature
A	dry out a little bit
C	yeah mm
A	yeah
B	well I still maintain you need a heat thermometer
C	well oh you I mean er that's an infallible way of making it
C	yeah
C	but when I took took it up to to my brother on his birthday
B	mm

C	well he
A	tablet
A	oh it's good
C	it is good actually isn't it?
A	just feeling that sugar going round though
B	mm
C	yeah
C	you should call this Osborne dessert
B	mm
A	type two diabetes
B	I've put the lid on to stop me eating more and more
C	oh
A	oh
B	yeah oh yeah
A	it is mainly sugar isn't it?
C	yeah cos in fact this recipe there's condensed milk in it I love
A	so sugar and condensed milk
C	I I love any recipe with
A	with condensed milk
C	condensed milk because I just love condensed milk
A	yeah I get confused between evaporated milk
C	oh no
A	and condensed milk
C	condensed is
D	mm
C	a thick one
[ANNOTATION]	Condensed milk is full fat.	Neutral
A	but yes I know I know I remember it
C	yes yeah
A	and my dad used to just spoon it
A	he would just eat it
C	yes yes
A	on its own
B	that's what
C	well I
B	of a certain generation
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker's A dad didn't like condensed milk.	Contradiction
C	I well I think
A	hence the type two diabetes in later life
C	no I think it
C	it's it's Second World War deprivation
B	yeah
A	oh yeah it's true
C	yeah I think it is
A	yeah that as well
C	but er when I was at at boarding school and that was in the fifties for some reason or other
A	oh
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker C has lived in a dormitory.	Entailment
C	rather like toothpaste tubes
A	yeah
C	so I had
C	condensed milk in my tuck box
A	oh
B	did they have it in India father?
D	yes
A	mm
D	yes yeah the condensed milks
A	it's really good stuff
[ANNOTATION]	People in India don't like condensed milk as much as people in England do.	Neutral
D	were popular two you'd bang two holes
A	yeah
C	oh to get the air in
[ANNOTATION]	Condensed was not allowed in big quantities at the boarding school.	Neutral
D	to get in
A	and knock it back
C	mm
A	a shot
C	but I think it must have been something to do with sort of you know deprivation of
B	yeah
A	treats
C	yes yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A confuses evaporated and condensed milk.	Entailment
A	yeah
C	yeah yeah
A	well there's no sugar
B	you mean during er
A	no no
C	and of course there there weren't any any sweets or anything
A	no
C	so you know
B	rations
A	but
C	yeah
A	apparently people were quite healthy for it
C	yeah oh yes yeah
A	they would be
C	oh yeah I mean there was no obesity or anything
A	just through not having sugar and all those sorts of things
C	yeah
B	mm
C	well it's
A	even though it was probably quite a limited diet
C	yeah but I mean nowadays there's there are something like fifty percent of primary school children
A	see the trouble is
C	are obese
A	when it's there I have to eat it
B	yeah yeah that would all be gone
A	well
C	would it?
A	why would you want to stop?
D	yeah
C	oh I I couldn't eat all that
