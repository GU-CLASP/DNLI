B	oh I like your background
A	it was like a Japanese
B	did you take that picture huh?
A	no it's just off Google
B	let's have a look?
A	I just shut down
B	oh you shut down your computer?
A	well I have to swap over to Windows but I'll
B	ah
A	I'll
B	what is it you're running on if it's not Windows?
A	it's the Mac operating system
B	is it just called Mac operating system?
A	it's OSX ten point something
B	OS what? do you mind if I leave this up here?
A	yeah
B	alright
A	yeah
B	yeah
B	so the thing when you're travelling and doing so many things you do tend to not read very much
A	I know I thought I'd be reading lots
A	to be honest I thought I'd just be like chilling on the beach doing nothing but it got too hot to sit on the beach
B	yeah
A	yeah it is
B	where did you get these from? just any website in particular or you just searched? beautiful Japanese image
A	yeah I think that's the coolest one I've got the other ones are kind of just a bit stock
B	yeah okay was this one stock?
A	no
B	no?
A	got it off Google
B	ah dude your desktop is horrible
A	is a bit? what do you mean? that it's
B	how unorganised it is
A	yeah you have
B	oh this is the these things that these can do when you pay a lot of money
A	suppose
B	ooh does that slow it down at all?
A	no
B	it's just too fast
A	yeah it's quite cool
B	but this all this crap on your desktop is that just
A	it's not really needed
B	you being unorganised?
A	I could probably clear it up
A	but I can't be bothered
B	how do you find stuff that you don't sit looking through them?
A	well the stuff that is on here's not stuff that I really need access to
B	for
A	don't really have many apps up there just Utorrent
B	okay and you're telling me I needed all those apps?
A	mm
B	those ones
B	Word Powerpoint which version of of Word and Powerpoint have you got?
A	this is a Mac one or
B	does it just come free with it?
A	no I just torrented it just cos it's for two thousand eleven
B	oh cool
B	I'm running on like yeah Windows two thousand eleven I think or Windows two thousand and nine
A	mm
B	does the job
A	yeah
B	so what kind of games do you think we've got?
A	ah bunch
B	did you have Counter-Strike? huh?
A	yeah

B	er it's pretty terrible pretty bad
A	did I show you that Planetside game?
B	no what was that?
A	that's a shooter
B	yeah
A	it's quite cool
B	is it two player?
A	it's not two player
B	is it one that you have to like take turns doing it?
A	possibly yeah
B	right
A	I will get it updated and download it and I'll show you that quickly
B	I'm up for playing a few games I got nothing else to do tonight if you're up for it
A	sure
B	cool
A	we're probably not gonna let you play directly the learning curve is
B	yeah
B	it looks a bit crazy
A	it's not
B	so
A	it's just some random background
B	cool
A	yeah it's like a giant
B	I think you've been playing this for years haven't you?
A	that was Planetside one they rereleased it
B	oh
A	like er last year
B	so you're gonna play one game put a one player game first?
A	yeah
B	cool
A	but it might take
B	welcome to
A	while I do this I'll set up the emulator
B	did you put the amp up on Ebay?
A	huh?
B	did you put the amp up on Ebay?
A	no I can't until I can test it and I can't test it until the
B	oh shit
A	yeah
B	yeah I do
A	it's a good one
B	do you not need it?
A	I don't need it
B	but I mean like
A	ah this stood the test of time I don't think it'll break it's
A	doesn't matter
B	cool I mean yeah that
A	it's it's a really good mouse
B	really cool
A	yeah
B	oh that's pretty useful
A	yeah
B	what are the buttons on the side?
A	er
B	really? why why did you stop using it?
A	just cos I got that one
B	does look pretty nice
A	yeah
B	yeah what's meant to be better about this one?
A	nothing
A	but that was like a fifty quid mouse
B	oh bloody hell
A	it's just
B	you sure you wanna put that into my
A	yeah it's fine
B	uncapable hands? and then this is just an Xbox controller?
A	yeah
B	through and through
A	mm
B	I'm gonna be so crap
A	no I read that one
B	you did?
A	yeah
B	do you like it?
A	yeah it was good
B	it's a good book isn't it that one?
A	what's that book?
B	can't even remember what I bought you now
A	well the film's crap so
B	the film's terrible but don't not read the book because of that because the book is nothing like the film
A	is it?
B	nothing like it
A	really?
B	it's quite
A	how did they make a film out of it and call it World War Z?
B	what's this in Meteora Greece
A	yeah
B	and then the film
A	god the film's crap
B	had nothing to do with it whatsoever
A	it's just action
A	yeah
B	dad liked it
A	I don't think he liked it that much like when I
B	did you?
A	and like I had
A	it's
B	it's pretty poor yeah
A	oh shit
B	it's worth reading don't let the film put you off
A	this is like a massive game
B	I wonder if I can put this like that
[ANNOTATION]	The book is not worth reading either.	Contradiction
B	yeah I know
A	perhaps
B	the speakers are coming
A	it has
B	oh that's true yeah it will get a lot of keyboard
A	I think it'll be alright
B	yeah
A	I dunno
B	yeah no it's not
[ANNOTATION]	They all enjoyed the movie a lot, especially their father.	Contradiction
A	reflects
B	actually pointing towards us
A	but now I can't play
B	is there not room for your mouse there if you move the keyboard over a little bit like that?
B	is that good?
A	it's rubbish
B	you've not lost any space
A	oh my god
B	these are your nice speakers aren't they?
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	A does not have enough space to play, even if he moves the keyboard.	Entailment
B	mine are crap
A	right
B	a while ago
A	by the looks of things
B	alright that's picking up
A	that's good
A	what?
[ANNOTATION]	A got their good speakers as a Christmas present.	Neutral
A	okay so I'll play with the keyboard which is gonna be confusing
B	oh so we are playing two player?
A	I'll try it
B	yeah cool
A	but not for that game
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	This is not the first time they play a multiplayer game.	Neutral
A	A W
B	buttons
B	that keyboard is so small
A	yeah
B	how do you fit your hands on that?
A	set space
B	do you normally play games with the controller then?
A	what what it can pick up the mouse as the controller that's a bit weird
B	can it?
A	look look watch
B	what if we talk?
A	no it's it's picking up the mouse on here
B	oh the mouse?
B	yeah that is weird
A	I dunno how if that would work very well
B	how that's very sensitive
A	I can't imagine playing like that
B	no
A	give it a try
B	what game we playing first then?
A	well I've got Super Smash
B	oh you do?
A	yeah
B	is it the same version that I know?
A	no it's probably a newer one
B	oh cool
A	erm
B	I'm up for playing that
A	Underside
B	cool
A	maybe it'll work maybe it won't
B	what wasn't working about it before?
A	it just doesn't start
B	it's a long game
A	this is a long game
B	when was the last time you played it?
A	weeks
B	I haven't really played very often
A	I try to I tend to play one game and just play the shit out of it
B	yeah
A	and not touch anything else
B	do you remember that game you played like Evil something
A	god that was boring
B	was it?
A	yeah
B	you flew around in space
A	yeah yeah
A	it was like a
A	yeah
B	you played
A	well cos like you had the ability to get so rich and like control so much but like it never happened
B	no
A	and it just took so much work
A	and like anyone could just come out of anywhere and blow your shit up and destroy you and then you're back to square one
A	like no
B	don't destroy me
A	five hundred hours
A	of this and
A	this and now you're holding me for ransom
A	no it's not so good this working
B	well this isn't working
A	no that's not working
B	I remember playing Settlers that was a fun game
A	that was rubbish
A	that was just was bad
B	Total Annihilation
A	right Super Smash Brawl
B	I like that one as well
A	Total Annihilation was awesome
B	oh is this a Wii version?
A	oh have you seen the new Total Annihilation?
B	no
A	oh man they redid it yeah this is the Wii version let me see if I can find that game if I've still got it installed
B	how big's your hard drive on this one?
A	erm terabyte it's split up between quite a few things like
B	partitions
A	ah no I don't think I've got it
B	do you uninstall games quite frequently?
A	yeah
B	do you think Windows Defender is okay? that's just my the only virus thing that I've got on
A	dunno sounds like
B	apparently it's
A	I don't think it's gonna rain
B	no but still
A	yeah
B	the dew starts coming out
A	let me have a look ah
B	what are you looking for?
A	I'll have a look on my hard drive
B	where would it be? on your old hard drive?
A	whoops
B	where's what?
A	oh here it is
B	have you got a WD My Passport one as well?
A	not My
B	oh cool
A	something or other
B	hang on a sec
A	see if this works
B	online interaction's not rated
A	yeah
B	the one on the N sixty-four was pretty fun wasn't it?
A	yeah
B	so it should work
A	yes there you go
B	good stuff
A	right there you go
B	are you prepared to get whooped
A	ah
A	probably
B	so what is it in general? can you remember?
A	just gonna get the wireless keyboard
B	yeah that is pretty useful
A	these controllers these controllers are gonna be a pain to remember
B	yeah
A	erm right
B	is this just you against me first?
A	yeah we'll have a quick practice
B	Olimar? what is that? oh he's from erm
A	Pikmin
A	I've got that as well
B	that was kind of fun
A	Ike's my favourite
B	ah there was two of them and it was
A	Marth
B	Fox was quite good
A	yeah
B	hang on these look like the same characters as last time
B	mm
A	erm shall we have me and you against
B	right okay
A	this is five
A	erm
B	you gotta keep beating them up until you can throw em completely off the screen?
A	yeah
B	that was a good concept
A	here we go
B	cool
A	you should remember this
B	and I'm Zelda
A	yeah that's not a
B	who's that dude not moving at the top? Link
A	oh that's erm he's not really there
B	so is it me and you against these two?
A	yeah
B	cool
A	I might need to mess with the settings on this it's not perfect
B	I used to know all the moves and stuff now I don't know how to do anything
A	right let's let's try something
B	yeah it is a bit laggy
A	let's try the different Dolphin
B	yeah I remember having a Dolphin
A	I dunno
B	yeah
A	probably
B	what do you think could be going wrong?
A	I dunno I probably don't have things set right
A	hang on
B	I mean it was running
A	yeah
B	it's definitely a bit laggy though
A	file
B	Gamecube
B	see what they say
A	so Dolphin Super Smash Bro Brawl
B	do you have to set it up differently for every game then?
A	sometimes yeah
B	oh no
A	erm configurations
B	skip graphics
A	ah where is that?
B	there
A	there we go
B	skip
A	okay is that it? there's nothing else? nothing else what?
B	what other kind of settings should there be?
A	I don't know but I had it working perfectly once
A	no for some reason
B	maybe that thing you just clicked will do it
A	let's see
B	did you exit the game or are we just paused?
A	er it's exited
B	oh no
B	you look like you have Zelda on there
A	yeah I do
B	the original Zelda?
A	yeah I think I got that as well
B	did they ever release a newer one?
A	yeah they did
B	was it any good?
A	yeah it was
B	yeah
A	oh let's just do this bit first
B	I never completed the original one either
B	ah
A	well this looks faster
B	so what's it doing? yeah it looks much faster
A	I dunno
B	cool
A	I think I'm these I'm two people
B	yeah you are
A	well I think we are actually
B	ah
A	right shall we repick our characters?
B	yeah I'm still trying to figure it out let me play with this guy for a little bit
A	alright
B	that one used to ah that was how you did that
A	it's one of the side buttons
B	oh yeah
A	like Z or something but there is no Z so it's must be a shoulder
B	that one yeah?
A	yeah ah
B	oh yeah and you have a defence bubble
A	yeah
B	I forgot that
A	I don't know where my button for that is
B	that's the shoulder buttons
A	no not that you can charge
B	how do you grab them?
A	erm using the
B	how do you throw em

A	you're lucky you have
B	oh
A	what what?

B	what happened there we just all had three hundred percent health
A	yeah
B	just one hit
A	pretty much
B	they haven't really changed anything
A	no not really
B	no
A	you get extra moves
B	all the moves are the same
A	you do have more moves than the original
B	you do
A	Brawl
B	like
A	yeah
B	this thing's
A	it has changed a bit like they don't really do much like they just made the graphics a lot better
B	yeah
A	and kind of refined
B	oh Lucas is that guy with the yoyo isn't it?
A	yeah
B	Diddy Kong wasn't in it before was he?
A	no
B	Zelda Sheik

B	yeah how do we take em off?
A	there we go
B	there we go
A	let's change this
B	yeah just
A	five lives
B	yeah sounds good
A	right we'll go on a cool level
B	yeah
A	this one's pretty cool
B	what's cool about this one?
A	the
B	oh what? I thought I was a Pokemon Trainer
A	you were a Pokemon but some one of his moves is to swap out for another Pokemon
B	ah ah
B	oh shit
A	well
B	there we go here
A	well like up and B or down and B whatever your

A	it you shot out with a staple and caught on how the hell do you do that?
B	erm I just used my up and B really
A	oh no
A	yeah it's cool
B	I always thought you could throw these things
A	I used to play this for hours rather than go to school
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	oh shit
A	oh the usual crap
B	yeah? used to play things all the time when you were doing
A	er used to be like we just we'd fight for like ten minutes and like no moves would actually connect cos we'd be dodging everything
B	woah
A	yeah
B	woah
A	it was a star
B	ah shit I keep doing that by accident I don't mean to
A	we've got the like the power scale down low
B	oh shit
A	but like stay still for a second
B	no
A	I'll show you my guy's move
B	no
A	if I can fully charge that up you
B	what happened there?
A	oh shit
A	that's got it
B	oh
A	yeah
B	that's all good
A	that'd be good
B	yeah that's the thing you've gotta listen you can't just cut the sound out and then it's goes to another
A	right
B	topic of conversation
A	you need to kind of work of trying to actually have a conversation and play it at the same time it's not so easy
B	no well we're doing it
A	kind of
B	yeah
A	but then there's the awkward silence where you get into playing cos
B	yeah
A	you forget
B	ah
A	yeah
B	we keep changing
A	yeah
B	oh
A	I've got erm ah do you remember? did you ever play Soulcalibur?

B	but if I pause it can I do that?
A	you can't pause it
B	right
A	cos you're not playing
B	I did something
A	we'll just restart
B	so this is for the Wii or isn't it? did the Wii ever get big?
A	not really
B	seemed a bit crappy to me
A	it was a bit
B	oh what are they doing next?
A	like the Gamecube was good
B	it was alright
A	and then it kind of
B	I really like Jet Force Gemini on it
A	yeah
B	that was a cool game
A	probably get that it was two player but like the second player didn't really do much
B	no
A	just play that little dog thingy or
B	oh yeah
A	could do that yeah
B	Meta Knight so I'm in right so what happened last time?
A	I don't know
B	okay

A	when you do what?
B	he's lost it
A	down and B
B	down and B just changed
A	I think you've lost the whirlwind though

B	oh crap
A	what is this supposed to do?
B	yes
A	that move hasn't done anything yet
B	alright well we're on zero zero so
A	yeah

A	oh look it's working
A	yeah it's not so easy to play
B	I'm gonna need more space for the mouse on this one
A	okay
B	and you're saying let's play this game cos
A	on this game there's four continents
B	mm
A	two of them are locked at the moment but they're like completely different like this one's all icy
B	well
B	it's like Turok or something
A	yeah it is a bit like Turok in here
B	yeah the map's pretty big then?
A	yeah and there's
B	yeah there's a lot more in this one
A	oh I
B	oh nice
A	yeah it's quite good it's free
B	it's free?
A	yeah
B	sorry
A	I've got a portable rocket launcher
B	oh holy shit
A	this bit's really awesome
B	and then you can fire it? oh no way
A	yeah
B	oh I bet
A	and I've got some ammo
B	oh that's cool
A	on the rail grenade launcher
B	loads of them
A	different sights and stuff
B	oh
A	and er that's just for that one gun
B	you've got the set up you like there
A	there's tons of different guns so there's infiltrators which can go invisible
B	mm
A	engineers which can place shields and guns and shit
B	no
A	so I'm going to
B	you can get vehicles as well
A	redeploy
B	this game does look cool
A	yeah
B	right
A	Indar here we are
B	these maps are humongous
A	yeah they're quite big
B	where's that?
A	and at every
B	ooh
A	yeah so that's the infiltrator so you can go invisible
B	that's cool
A	that's looking a bit bugged there why's it blue? er I prefer engineer
B	he can fix things and stuff
A	yeah
B	what?
A	it's the portable shield
B	do they keep getting new staff then for the gear?
A	yeah
B	the whole world?
A	not the whole world but this part is called the Warp Gate and it's
B	oh cool
A	so it's like a safe zone
B	how many people can you get on one map?
A	hundreds
B	the continent is full
A	yeah it kind of is
B	yeah
A	a tank
B	it's massive
A	customise all the weapons
A	erm and then aircraft
B	cos you have to go and get all these little
A	yeah so
B	that that looks cool
A	this is the big transport for the galaxy which is from this one
B	yeah
A	I'm get a little fighter
B	oh you're straight in one
A	yeah
B	it's really hard to see
A	well
B	did you say your HUD? heads-up display?
A	yeah like where's all this information? okay oh well I'll fly around
B	yeah they look a bit difficult to manoeuvre
A	yeah
B	so where are you headed? how do you know which way to go?
A	ah right well I need to have a look at the map
B	is it quite difficult to land?
A	yeah woah woah woah woah woah
A	there we go
B	so where are we now?
A	I'm there
B	oh
A	so I'll go up here
B	yeah
A	that's probably more interesting than fighting them
B	over there
A	no here should be
B	very misty this map
A	yeah
B	oh you're doing pretty good
A	yeah I could but where's the fun in that?
B	could just choose the
A	if I go over the tree
B	woah
A	woah I won't see a thing will I?
B	er
A	woah
A	I don't have very good guns for this
B	no
A	just one main gun which is impossible to hit anyone with
B	can you just jump out of it now you're in it er?
A	you could yeah
B	okay
A	I don't really want to cos I don't get too many of these
B	oh you're burning out
B	seriously no good
A	no
B	suppose you got part of it there
A	yeah
B	how good's the sniper on this thing?
A	pretty good
B	is it fairly easy to kill people with this?
A	if I hit them in the head they're dead in one
B	two
A	there's no good vantage points here this is not a good idea
B	choose a different weapon?
A	yeah
