B	so I'm glad we're finally on the train after a twenty minute delay
A	I know well the tracks at
B	yeah I can't believe like how much the flooding's like affected us like I had no idea how bad it was
A	I know
B	erm
A	well I've never ever seen it flooded in
B	yeah I know
A	it's so sad and when you drive through
B	yeah
A	and like all the sofas and
B	businesses
A	everything in just in the middle of the streets it's so bad
B	yeah like my friend's er dad owns a business and all of his work that er was due to be shipped out has been ruined so obviously that's not good is it?
A	oh god and so close to Christmas as well
B	I know
A	there was this family that posted on Facebook looking for a erm house to rent
B	yeah
A	because their son's in hospital with cancer and he can come home now for Christmas but they don't have anywhere to live so it's awful
B	yeah I think the only positive thing to come out of it is the deadline's
A	I know well I didn't I didn't have to do my stats exam
A	because they've postponed it all which I think the stats teacher's quite annoyed at but
B	I know well even my I've got two essays in for January I didn't think they'd be affected and they've been moved back two weeks afterwards so
A	no no that's good
B	I know cos I thought it was just near me
A	yeah
A	like
B	has he got it back now or anything?
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	yeah
A	he's got like a brand new BM so I don't think he'd've
B	oh it wasn't the one near the car wash was it? I saw loads of pictures on Facebook and that was a fifteen BMW
A	yeah no I think it oh maybe it was no no I don't think it was
B	right by the car wash like in the middle of
A	no no it was up
B	yeah
A	it's awful there's so many animals that have been killed as well there was this
B	ah
A	poor little cat that was on a fence
B	mm?
A	and erm this woman saw it and it'd just dropped into the floodwater so she just managed to get it out it was such a shame
B	ah
A	but then she had dogs at her house so she said she couldn't keep it so erm she was like appealing for someone to take this little cat in and then this other girl on Facebook said that she'd take it in
B	mm
A	so they had to like wade through floodwater to meet her and
B	mm well there was that dog on Facebook people were saying erm it fell in the river and it just got swept off cos obviously the current was too fast
A	ah and did you see that
B	a donkey? no
A	yeah like the erm animal rescue team wanted to rescue it but the police told them not to it was too dangerous but they did and then it had the cheesiest grin
B	yeah oh yeah I saw that it was like proper smiling wasn't it?
B	ah that was funny
A	it looked like a person
A	yeah
A	so what do you want to do in
B	erm well I think it depends on the weather but obviously well we've eaten now haven't we? so if we have a wander round we'll go and get a drink I'll leave it to you cos obviously you know it better than me really don't you? but
A	yeah yeah
B	erm obviously look round the markets
A	yeah
A	we'll have to go to
B	mulled wine
A	yeah we'll have to go to the dome that's really nice
B	yeah
A	it has like a massive Christmas tree inside
B	erm where are we booked in for food again?
B	yeah what did your mum call it?
B	yeah that's meant to be well known well obviously my friend went there last night so she must've
A	yeah did you ask her if it was good?
B	well she said I'd love it cos it's all Christmassy like
A	yeah erm yeah I'm glad we booked there instead of
B	yeah it does it does look really good inside
A	yeah I was looking at some reviews there and they said it was a bit like overrated and the service wasn't great and the food wasn't that good
B	did you enjoy it for your graduation
A	yeah yeah yeah it was really nice but
B	mm
A	I think
B	oh a long time ago like a couple of years ago
A	mm
B	I've been wanting to go for like weekends away and stuff in fact I almost booked a wedding but
A	oh did you?
B	yeah
A	ah yeah I love
B	yeah it's so like historical and stuff could we go erm near the castle and stuff?
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah you've got to pay if you want to go round
B	yeah but we don't need to do that do we? but we could go and look
A	yeah I erm I never went round it when I was at uni in
B	oh really?
A	if well they there was like this old wives' tale that if you went round the castle while you were studying there it was like bad luck so
A	I thought I'd better not risk it
B	yeah oh no I need all the help I can get
A	so I never went round I know so have you applied to do like your masters now?
B	erm almost I've half applied I'm gonna apply to
A	yeah
B	but
A	erm that's like an hour and a half
B	yeah I might apply there as well
A	like north of
B	is there stuff to do round it? like is there?
A	I don't really I've never been to
B	yeah I
A	yeah
B	cos obviously the funding continues so that'd be an easy option
A	oh that's good
B	yeah and obviously it's a good reputation isn't it?
A	yeah
B	it is good to stay there
A	so do you get discount from
B	no I think you know how student finance covers four years?
A	yeah
B	I think it instead of me paying like eleven grand to do my LPC in
A	oh that's good
B	I think it's six grand it works out as
A	yeah
B	how much did you pay for yours? was it six thousand?
A	I think it was like six thousand eight hundred but then I got an a thousand grand scholarship
B	oh yeah
A	so that helped a little bit but
B	I got a two thousand pound scholarship first year but erm for the grades and stuff but
A	yeah yeah yeah well mine was for academic performance
B	yeah
B	mm
A	so she gets a nine grand scholarship for her masters because
B	really?
A	yeah she started uni when the fees were higher
B	yeah so did I though
A	yeah so
A	so that more than covers her fees and she's got like a bit extra in the bank which is really good
B	why did she get that then?
A	at
B	why?
A	just because she paid the higher fee rates and I think her your family income has to be so much and whatever it's worth looking into though
B	oh see that's where
A	like there's certain criteria you have to fill fulfil to get it but
B	yeah just so expensive now you know?
A	oh yeah well nine grand a year's a lot
B	yeah and after when I graduate next year I'm gonna be like
A	oh I know don't even talk about it
B	three thousand was it?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	I think it was like three thousand
B	yeah
A	or less than I think it was a bit cheaper
B	I think yeah cos I applied to erm where did I apply to in Scotland? I can't remember and erm it was cheaper
A	yeah oh yeah it is
B	it's like Scottish universities are cheaper aren't they? even
A	yeah yeah
B	but don't erm if you were born in Scotland you get it for free don't you?
A	but then you've got an extra year yeah
B	that's so good
A	and and if you live in the EU it's so bad
B	yeah
A	there's definitely a bit of hatred there still
A	so er what did you do last night? did you go out for tea in the end?
B	yeah went for a nice meal I ended up having a Christmas dinner I was just gonna get the pizza and then erm and then there was the turkey dinner
A	mm
B	meat was a bit fatty though
A	mm
B	it was good
A	and who did you meet up with?
B	erm my old work colleague she's working somewhere else obviously and I am now but erm yeah we like to catch up occasionally
A	mm nice how's she doing?
B	so yeah yeah good I think yeah she's really enjoying like her workplace and stuff
A	yeah
B	she actually went for a Christmas party the night after our old work do and they hired out you know the
A	oh yeah
B	it was like teepees
A	oh
B	and it's nice it's all lit up inside and stuff so
A	oh lovely yeah I went to see Elton John
B	oh yeah you did didn't you?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	I hope they get like more big acts there it's good cos we don't get anyone near us
A	and it's like a really good venue it can fit like loads of people in
B	yeah
A	although we were just like sat on plastic chairs
B	how close would that be though?
A	yeah yeah I know it would
A	yeah well I don't really like Elton John myself but he's such a big name and he was so close I think you've got to like support it
B	oh yeah you might as well
A	yeah
B	well I was gonna go but I think the tickets were a bit
A	yeah so is?
B	I would really like to see Michael McIntyre there
A	oh yeah that would be great
B	yeah his new tour
A	I was gonna book tickets actually he was on in October in
B	yeah yeah
A	but
B	well I saw him with
A	yeah
B	we could go actually we could have a look for tickets
A	yeah that'd be good
B	I bought his new DVD as like a little stocking filler for my parents
A	oh nice what you gonna get your mum and dad for Christmas?
B	I've got my mum a spa day
A	yeah
B	at the
A	the
A	oh lovely
B	erm I wish it included lunch really but it was just erm a treatment use of facilities and then
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	and then I've also got her a top from Zara
A	oh nice
B	erm and I might get her some like Liz Earle moisturiser as well dad I got him oh I got him this really nice erm TK Maxx I love TK Maxx especially for Christmas shopping it's like a real leather Ipad case
A	oh
B	and it's got like a notepad and stylus and stuff
A	oh lovely
B	and it was down from like a hundred and ten to twenty-four ninety-nine
A	that's really good
B	so I got him that some Ralph Lauren pyjamas in TK Maxx again
A	yeah
B	they were like twenty quid
A	oh very nice
B	and then erm some L'Or√©al post shave balm that he likes
A	yeah I got a erm
B	what have you got?
A	well I got a
B	for your mum? or for?
A	no no for me like last year or the year before
A	erm but I've just
B	from TK Maxx?
A	no no no it was from Ted Baker
B	oh right
A	but I haven't been able to afford the Ipad yet so it's just
A	sitting there
B	so you bought the case with no Ipad?
A	yeah well I really liked the case and I was gonna get the Ipad but then
B	mm I
A	yeah
B	it was like two six nine or something
A	er yeah
B	it's not too bad
A	yeah my mum gave me like money towards it but then I was in a bit of
A	yeah I was in debt then from uni so I was like oh right you can just pay that off so
B	yeah
A	yeah I haven't got one yet I'll get one one day I'm sure
B	yeah
A	and then my dad just wants like a log basket because
B	what?
A	well he hates like pointless Christmas presents
A	yeah like he's he's very honest about it and like if he doesn't like them he's just like what is this you have given me?
B	what has he got in the past that he doesn't like?
A	oh just like nice little gifts like clothes and things like that he's just like mm the zip doesn't fit over my nose and
B	what?
A	well he's got a big nose so he's like really paranoid about zips and things
B	have you got that yet?
A	no no we need to find one with strong enough handles
B	where are you gonna get one?
A	cos he
B	how do you wrap that?
A	don't
A	probably put like a big ribbon round it or something?
A	a few holly berries on top very Christmassy
B	what are you getting your mum then?
A	I think she wants like a spa day or something I don't know she's hard to buy for because she just likes her bargains and things and
B	yeah spa
A	yeah
B	erm yeah do that you like your spa dates don't you?
A	yeah
B	I really wanted to take her to that place you went
A	oh yeah
B	you know? sixty pounds each or whatever it was
A	I know
B	that's a bit ridiculous
A	it is really pricey it's lovely though
B	yeah
A	I mean that's quite a good deal for there really because I was looking into it and if if you just stay overnight there you've still got to pay thirty pounds for the spa which is crazy
B	yeah you said didn't you? it's ridiculous
A	yeah but with that package you get like the spa and then the afternoon tea
B	did you get? oh you get afternoon tea
A	yeah
B	well that one I did was just lovely
A	yeah
B	erm
A	where was that at?
A	oh right
B	so like you got erm like fruit on arrival like erm a two course lunch and stuff
A	oh
B	it was so nice
A	yeah the one me and my mum went to was nice that was
B	yeah
A	for erm
B	yeah
A	like run down it could've done with a refurb but yeah it was nice there's some good offers around
B	yeah
A	oh
B	it's just so hard like all the psychometric tests that they expect you to do and then
A	oh my god I know
B	the assessment centres and stuff I just don't know how anyone gets employed I really don't
A	yeah well the psychometric tests I
B	I know yeah
A	like didn't you say you got that that weird question?
B	yeah it wasn't anything to do with law it was just like palm reading but it was really hard like a massive paragraph and the amount I know it's all meant to be how you deal with time pressure and stuff
A	yeah
B	but it was about fifty questions in twelve minutes like massive paragraphs and then like and then the actual question itself was like four lines long
A	mm
B	it was just ridiculous
A	well
B	mm
A	but it was fully booked I only found out about it like a month before it was
B	the postgrad open day?
A	yeah yeah
B	yeah
A	and they didn't like tell us it was happening on our course which was quite annoying when I'm like a student there
B	yeah
A	and I can't even attend cos it was fully booked but erm because I
B	mm
A	they like emailed me to say erm like to give me the information on like the Powerpoints and stuff that they'd
B	yeah
A	presented in the open day and
B	yeah
A	they said that they don't even read your application so you spend like so long on your personal statement and everything like that
B	yeah
A	and they don't even look at it it's all based on this psychometric test and they
B	it shouldn't just be that that should be in addition to
A	I know well they justify it by saying that like they don't want to erm you know advantage students that come from like wealthier backgrounds but I don't understand
B	no it should just be as a whole
A	yeah surely students that come from
B	yeah
A	more privileged backgrounds will be able to get people to answer the questions
B	yeah
A	it should be based on the experience you have and things
B	it should be everything overall like you know? you might not be as strong as that but you might have loads of experience to talk about
A	yeah yeah
B	so cos I have quite a lot of experience I think but
A	yeah
B	obviously not
A	no I think the application itself and your personal statement is a pretty a good indicator rather than your answers on a test really
B	yeah it shows how you like you really want it and stuff and what you can offer to the course doesn't it?
A	yeah
B	I dunno I think I'll do the masters for a year and that gives me a bit longer to decide what I'm actually gonna do
A	mm
B	yeah so erm what did you do this weekend did you say?
A	oh I went to
B	oh yeah yeah yeah
A	erm yeah with erm me and
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	and he he was just like trying to get jobs in
B	oh I applied to them
A	oh did you?
B	yeah and what was really good about them actually going off what we were saying
A	yeah
B	erm they go off just psychometric tests they don't look at even if you're on like a third which I I don't I'm obviously not on they erm just go off your test and how er you er are in the interview so I don't know how that
A	yeah
B	but anyway carry on
A	erm yeah
B	oh really
A	so erm yeah he managed to get a job in London so he's moved there now and
B	yeah
A	I don't think
B	yeah
A	everything so she's moved down there now but she had like an amazing flat in Glasgow in
B	yeah
A	it was so nice and she's still got like a nice flat but it's a lot smaller than the one in Glasgow
B	well it's just not the same value for money is it?
A	no not at all
B	you'd literally get a studio flat in London for like eight hundred pounds a month
A	yeah yeah well she was paying I think like three fifty in Glasgow for a really nice
B	how much was she paying sorry?
A	three fifty I think
B	and she was halving that
A	with all the bills in no she wasn't halving it that was
B	that was just what it was?
A	yeah
B	no way really?
A	her sharing it with someone else for three fifty each
B	oh I was gonna say
A	but erm but now she's in
B	yeah
A	yeah each for a one bed
B	that's ridiculous
A	flat and quite a way out of the centre
B	is she happy there though?
A	I think she is yeah I mean there's plenty going on all the time and stuff and she's with
B	yeah
A	they only used to see each other like every few months or whatever so
A	yeah but she's still having to travel quite a lot up to
B	yeah
A	we stayed at erm
B	er
A	yeah we oh
B	oh Uber yeah
A	yeah I'd never heard of it
B	yeah it's meant to be really good yeah
A	yeah so it's
B	I don't know what it is really it's just
A	well it's like people that have like cars and are free that evening I think and like they check them out
B	oh is it? I thought it was just like a an er just a different taxi service
A	no no
B	and like you can just do it on your phone and then you see who's available I didn't know it was like random people
A	I don't I don't know I think it is
B	is that safe?
A	I don't
B	I dunno we'll we'll google it later
A	I'm not sure so yeah we stayed at
B	yeah
A	cos she's moved there too cos
B	yeah
A	but
B	oh she flies there then?
A	yeah yeah
B	is that not a bit of a faff with like security and stuff? does?
A	oh I think it's a lot quicker than getting the erm the train there so
B	really though? cos you have to get there like two hours before then wait and then
A	yeah well I think when it's a short haul flight you don't have to be there as
B	yeah
A	long before
B	so erm what did you actually do in London then?
A	erm
B	you were there for two nights weren't you?
A	yeah well the first night we arrived quite late cos the train was delayed
B	yeah
A	erm so we just went round to
B	is he nice?
A	yeah yeah he was really nice actually quite quiet but I guess he was a bit nervous and
B	yeah
A	like English is his second language so that must be like a bit difficult
B	yeah
A	but yeah he was really nice really friendly blew up our little blow up bed for us which was nice
B	ah
A	erm and then we went out in
B	yeah I thought you were tagged in yeah
A	yeah which is like
B	yeah
A	erm yeah so that was good
B	was it nice there?
A	yeah it was really expensive though
B	yeah I bet
A	cost us like twenty pounds just to get into the club and then
B	that's ridiculous
A	it was eight pounds for a single vodka and like mixer
B	that's like Ibiza prices isn't it?
A	yeah yeah
B	how can you
A	yeah
B	that's just
A	it wasn't a particularly nice club either there was a club in Edinburgh that we always used to go to called the
B	oh yeah
A	underground and like really horrible and
B	yeah yeah
A	but that was like free entry and like really cheap drinks I think it cost us like
B	yeah
A	two pounds for like a double vodka or something so you can sort of understand that but but yeah it was nice to like see them and catch up with them but it was so expensive I couldn't believe it I mean I know
B	I just don't think it's worth it it's too fast paced and stuff you know what I mean? and if I'm like
A	yeah yeah it's just so busy everywhere you go isn't it? and then on the Sunday
B	mm
A	we went to we woke up quite late actually we woke up at like half eleven
B	yeah oh
A	we had lunch there
B	yeah
A	and went to the erm winter wonderland
B	mm
A	which was awful
B	why? I thought it was meant to be nice
A	it it
B	it's not like a full on thing I think it's just like
A	no it was just absolutely crammed with people
B	yeah
A	it was horrible and it's just like a massive cheap fairground really
B	yeah
A	and I wasn't very impressed with it at all so
B	did they like it? or not?
A	no so then we went to erm
B	yeah
A	so we had like a few drinks there and then we went to
B	yeah
A	which has like loads of gay bars and things and then
B	I
A	yeah I think it's a bit different in London
B	yeah
B	did you like it there?
A	yeah it was fun erm we went in this one
B	oh yeah were they in that bar?
A	yeah they were like outside
A	erm
B	you should've gone and said hello
A	so yeah I know they're really
A	well they seem really nice on Gogglebox
B	yeah
A	erm and then we had an early night and then we booked to go to the erm
B	oh I was gonna say you'd have to book probably wouldn't you?
B	yeah
A	to erm
B	I really wanna go to the
A	there's a reference there's a restaurant called
A	yeah
B	yeah I really want to go there
A	yeah that's supposed to be really nice but that was all fully booked
A	I think you could go at like six forty-five or something but
B	yeah
A	we weren't willing to get up at like five
A	in the morning to go so we erm
B	mm
A	we booked in the
B	yeah
A	it was really nice had eggs benedict
B	ah
A	and like a fruit smoothie it was delicious and then we went to the
A	erm I think the eggs benedict was like twelve quid
B	oh wow
A	and the fruit smoothie was like three fifty
B	yeah yeah
A	but it was really good
B	yeah
A	and
B	it's nice for a weekend though
A	yeah a little treat
B	yeah
A	and then we went to erm
B	yeah
A	which was good very weird though there was like one canvas that just had like a rip in the middle of it
B	mm oh oh my gosh yeah
A	it was bizarre
B	I love erm natural history museum and the science museum
A	oh yeah
B	in like Washington New York I er assume it would be like the same in
A	yeah yeah
B	I haven't been to the
A	yeah it's
B	oh actually yes I have been to the
A	when did you go to
B	erm I went with school I think
A	did you?
B	yeah erm on a school trip don't know what it was for but I think it was English or something I can't remember
A	I went I went to the
B	did you?
A	I went to see the Cirque du Soleil
B	oh nice
A	that was really good actually
B	I'd love to see like a show like Wicked or something
A	oh yeah Wicked's really good actually
B	yeah
A	me and
B	what's that?
A	last year it's erm a play about a boy with autism
B	mm
A	and he like finds this dog that's been killed in his backyard
B	yeah I wouldn't like that
A	with like a fork through the middle of it
B	yeah no
A	no it's
A	it's just it's really good really clever
B	yeah
A	I really enjoyed the book so I was thinking like the play might not be quite as good but
B	yeah
A	it was really really good I loved it
B	ah
A	and then we went to Gordon Ramsay's restaurant that was amazing
B	I love erm do you watch Masterchef?
A	yeah
B	my
A	mm
B	I just find Gordon Ramsay like shouts too much like surely if you go to a restaurant you don't want him shouting in the kitchen cos you can hear him can't you?
A	he's not actually in the restaurant unfortunately
B	well he'll be in one of them surely? like the
A	I think he like pops in from time to time but
B	oh does he?
A	yeah he's like trained them all yeah he doesn't come across and shout at you unfortunately I don't really like him himself
A	but his food is really good
B	what did you have? was it like is it super expensive?
A	oh yeah
B	yeah
A	it wasn't like mega mega money but yeah it was quite a lot
B	yeah
A	I had like this seven course tasting menu so I think we had
B	seven courses?
A	yeah we had like
B	yeah
A	had like lobster and duck and oh and then they brought these truffles out at the end which were like smoking what's it called? the like dry ice stuff which is quite cool
B	oh yeah yeah
A	and then erm we had like this chocolate dessert yeah it came out as like this big erm like chocolate sphere thing
B	yeah
A	and then you got this like erm liquid chocolate sauce stuff
B	oh wow
A	like pour on top and then it like all dissolved it was really fancy
B	yeah I would love that I think like for a special occasion just my parents don't really like erm spending a lot cos we eat out so much we can only afford to like
A	yeah
B	you know we can't do that all the time but yeah
A	yeah well we don't eat out very much so
B	I see yeah special
A	it was a special little treat
B	mm
A	I don't think I'll be going back again any time soon though unfortunately
B	might do that for like graduation or something that'd be nice
A	oh yeah
B	what shall we do for graduation? I wanna do something special
A	I don't know there aren't like that many nice places to eat in
B	well no I'd maybe we could go away for the weekend to celebrate
A	yeah that'd be nice
B	erm I don't know where to go
A	for my graduation we went to erm the
B	I thought you went to the
A	yeah we went to the
B	oh yeah
A	and then we went to the
B	ah where did your parents stay that night?

B	ah
A	which was oh it was awful actually

B	yeah
A	and erm woke up at I er well I couldn't sleep actually I don't know why I was just like
B	yeah
A	really nervous and excited
B	yeah
A	and erm woke up to this really loud thudding noise on the ceiling I'm like what is that? and it was like the gym above like someone was on the running machine and it was so loud
B	no way
A	yeah oh it was absolutely awful

A	it was like three in the morning and just constant for hours
B	you moved at three A M?
A	oh no no we complained the next day
B	oh I see
A	and then they moved us
B	it's ridiculous cos you could like drop like weights on the floor or anything do you know what I mean?
A	yeah yeah I don't know why they didn't have the gym at like the bottom of the hotel really
B	mm
A	no that was really annoying but the meal was really nice at the

B	I think I might
A	erm that's like raw beef it's quite nice

A	I haven't eaten there in ages actually
B	yeah
A	it does look really nice so is your friend seeing anyone at the moment?
A	yeah
B	yeah yeah she's erm she's been with him for like four or five years I just get the impression that he's a bit sort of controlling
A	oh is he?
B	yeah like erm on what she like you know? she can't even have a Facebook account which is fair enough cos I mean Facebook does cause a lot of trouble but it's not for him to say do you know what I mean?
A	yeah
B	erm so yeah
A	no that's not very good is it?
B	no
A	I think yeah if he if she cheated on him then maybe you could understand it but
B	yeah
A	it's a bit odd so when's erm
A	have they sorted it all out yet?
B	twenty-ninth
A	twenty-ninth of?
B	December
A	oh really? well that's really soon
B	yeah I know I really don't know what to wear because I was gonna buy a new dress for the occasion but I mean
A	yeah
B	so I think can you wear black to a wedding?
A	yeah I guess oh
B	I just I didn't I thought you were meant to wear colours cos I might wear this or my blazer
A	you could
B	with my black dress I wore for the law ball
A	yeah that'd be nice
B	with my fake Valentino shoes
A	yeah if you like dress it up a bit with a nice necklace or something I'm sure that'd be fine
B	yeah I don't wanna spend money just to
A	I need to get a dress for my mum and dad's wedding
B	oh yeah what are you gonna wear to that then?
A	I don't really know yet
B	so er is that alright then?
A	yeah
B	okay and I'll wear the shoes I wore to the law ball
A	yeah yeah I don't really know what to wear at all
B	are you gonna go like proper fancy?
A	well I'd like to wear like a nice dress but I don't think my mum's gonna wear a wedding dress or anything
B	no
A	she'll just wear like a nice eveningy dress
B	I'll wear erm
A	no they're both nice I don't know
B	yeah yeah
A	I don't know
B	probably not white cos obviously
A	yeah
A	no I think she's quite open to colours really
B	ah
A	she wants to go on like a crash diet first though so
B	does she?
A	I don't think she'll be buying a dress soon although it's only February it's not that long away
B	yeah you'll have to go shopping with her
A	yeah
B	I need a coffee to wake me up a bit
A	yeah I'm feeling quite sleepy I don't drink tea or coffee though that's the only problem
B	I think I think I'm like allergic to caffeine cos it makes me really ill
B	like I love it I love coffee but I just get really headachey and feel like car sick with it and
A	mm
B	yeah
A	my mum gets really bad headaches actually
B	but I love it
A	she has to have like a coffee to get rid of the headache
B	what?
A	I know
B	that's a bit strange
A	it's not very good really
B	that is really weird
A	so where's
B	erm
A	ah
B	so that'll be really nice cos it's a nice er golf club isn't it?
A	yeah
B	I love it there
A	oh that'll be nice
B	yeah
A	yeah I wonder if erm if
B	oh yeah I personally like obviously I'd prefer to before I had a baby but I wouldn't while I was pregnant you'd wanna be like your
A	yeah
B	I dunno I'd feel a bit
A	yeah I know what you mean
B	I'd do it afterwards I think
A	oh my god I can't believe it a guy in my year his girlfriend's had a baby and they didn't even know she was pregnant
B	yeah that's insane you find you hear about that a lot don't you?
A	I don't know
B	like you go to the toilet and then just pop out a baby
B	like could you imagine?
A	I think it's like quite rare
[ANNOTATION]	most people are aware of their pregnancy	Entailment
B	yeah
A	but yeah it's in the news a bit
B	I feel like I'd know I I feel like I'd have some kind of inkling surely?
A	I know it's hard to believe really isn't it?
B	yeah
A	but I mean they'd they'd just got a house together and they're engaged and everything so I think it was like a welcome surprise but
B	yeah how long have they been together for?
A	oh er like just over a year so not that long yeah
B	so not long so yeah I feel like obviously I was with someone for seven years but I it annoys me when people are together for like six months and then jump into everything and then they wonder why it doesn't work out
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	couples who move in too soon do not end well	Entailment
B	but I mean I I
A	no no but at the same time there's like no need to rush into things I don't think
B	do you know what I mean? cos
A	why? how long have they been together for?
B	maybe like two years
A	mm that's not long is it?
B	but they've they've had a
A	yeah
B	and they're living together and stuff I don't know I mean they seem happy but
A	yeah well it works out sometimes
B	I just feel like I like I didn't show much like he's done the honeymoon period for like six months do you know what I mean?
A	yeah yeah
B	I just think people don't know the real
[ANNOTATION]	many people move in together after six months	Neutral
A	yeah well looking after
B	yeah
A	like it's really nice looking after them but it's lovely giving them back again
B	I kind of don't know if I want them ever
A	really?
[ANNOTATION]	speaker B wants a baby	Contradiction
B	well I feel like sometimes I do like when I think of names I'm like oh that'd be kind of nice
B	but they just annoy me
A	yeah
B	like fitting in with school the boring school routine like every morning you can't just have a spontaneous weekend away and just takes the excitement out of everything
A	yeah
B	it's just boring and mundane like I feel like there's a lot of good things out of it you know it's obviously a very rewarding experience but
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	caring for children is enjoyable	Contradiction
B	I don't know
A	no I definitely don't want children yet I want to go travelling and things I know you can take like children with you obviously but it's a lot harder
B	yeah not really well can you imagine in the heat and stuff them whining? I can't deal with that
A	yeah oh did you get that video I sent you of
B	yeah yeah
A	she's such a cutie
B	yeah
A	yeah when we were on holiday
B	see it is nice like in that sense isn't it?
A	yeah when we were on holiday she was just like recognising like word
B	yeah
A	the word letters and things
B	yeah
A	erm but yeah it's crazy how fast she's
B	would she
A	no no no it's crazy how fast she's come on
B	ah
B	really? oh wow
A	yeah yeah she's a little brainbox I think
B	yeah she is like the class clown isn't she?
B	yeah
A	I don't know how she'll be getting on at school on her first day I like took her in cos I we were down there which was nice
B	yeah
A	and erm straight away she was like out in the play yard bit and there was like this big sandpit filled with water and she like persuaded her little friend to start splashing in it so
B	what?
A	they got covered in water before they'd even started the school day it was quite funny
A	yeah they've sent us over a massive Christmas list of everything they want
B	what?
A	yeah
B	isn't that a bit cheeky?
B	cos I mean
A	really?
B	and I think that's really cheeky
B	like and and also like have you seen in America they
A	oh yeah
B	like you put they put it on your list or whatever what's it called? there's a name for it
A	oh I don't know but yeah I know what you mean
B	you know what I mean? and I think that's rude to let you
A	yeah yeah
B	I I think it's just what I I dunno I'm not gonna contribute to their holiday like if they can't afford to have a holiday then don't get married like
A	no you shouldn't request unless it's like erm money towards charity or something instead of a gift you can sort of understand that but
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	erm
A	yeah well I think that's fair enough
B	so yeah
A	I don't I don't think my mum and dad will be asking for any wedding gifts at all
B	oh it's polite though to get something isn't it?
A	mm they're all there now aren't they?
A	a log basket probably
B	where on earth are you gonna get that from? you'll have to google maybe Amazon they have everything
A	well
B	oh yeah
A	so she sent us this one that was like
B	I don't know where we got ours from actually
A	she sent us this one that was just like a black plastic bucket
B	what?
A	yeah and then this one that was like made out of fabric
B	you want a nice wooden one like you seen in the in the
A	yeah well we've had a wicker one for ages and it's been really good but
B	yeah but ours is wicker I think
A	yeah
B	it looks really like modern
A	but it's starting to break away now it's very sad
B	and a mop
A	how romantic
B	and he was like oh it's for the house you know? you said you wanted one and she was like yeah for the house but not for me
B	I would I would just be like what is this?
A	yeah
B	take your present back then
A	well my dad doesn't really do presents I think my mum just buys herself something and
B	yeah
A	then he gives it to her
B	I just find men really hard to
A	mm
B	mum's fine like I'll get her skincare or something but dad I just he doesn't use anything like we got him this really expensive like eighty pound leather like bag for work and it'd be really nice you know? to take his work in and stuff
A	yeah
B	and he just takes it in like erm plastic bags
A	well I think yeah men are just a lot more practical aren't they?
B	doesn't appreciate it yeah
A	yeah I never know what to get my brother he's a hard one to buy for got no idea at all
A	yeah well that I think that was more
B	unless you look on Asos in the
A	it was more
B	oh was it?
A	but then I think they're they asked what we wanted as like an afterthought I
B	oh yeah
A	for my birthday and Christmas
B	did you send them it?
A	yeah so that'll be quite handy I still haven't
A	yeah
B	I'd find that awkward
A	well they've got me pretty awful presents for the past
B	oh yeah obviously yeah
A	ten years so I think I
B	yeah
A	deserve a jacket last year was awful I opened it up and I'd got these pink fluffy earmuffs with sequins all over it I was like oh my god what do I say?
A	I was like oh thanks and then I think I sort of like just put it erm on like the side of the carpet
B	mm
A	next to
B	would you not know that she wrapped it for you?
A	well I don't they were obviously more suited to a younger
B	yeah
A	child like
B	she just got you that?
A	oh and some other things but yeah that they were the
A	it was awful
B	and my nan used to go to the market and get me like plastic battery operated airplanes and helicopters
B	I was just like I was like
B	my mum used to hate my nan's gifts it was so funny she used to give them to charity
A	oh
B	and then nan used to make it really obvious that she didn't like
A	did she?
B	yeah
A	why? what would she be like?
B	she'd just be like have you got the receipt?
A	ah
B	so
B	yeah
A	like she spent ages trying to find like a nice present in John Lewis
B	yeah
A	she got them like this like posh candle thing
B	ah
A	and then erm like this set of like p√¢t√© and like chutney and stuff she thought like surely they'll use that?
B	oh that's nice mm yeah
A	and then anyway a
B	yeah
A	and erm her boyfriend returned home with like all this p√¢t√© and chutney that
B	yeah
A	and erm he was like oh yeah they they they weren't really using it so they thought it might come in handy for us like that's so rude
B	did she say you do know I bought that then?
A	well yeah I think like they knew it was her like
B	why would you give it back?
A	I know to the person that bought it you
B	unless they forgot
A	no no they can't've forgotten
B	you wouldn't do that though would you?
A	I'm like p√¢t√© and chutney it's quite a
B	yeah that's a nice gift yeah
A	yeah and they could've always given it to someone else
A	and now she's like I don't have a clue what to get them like
B	why doesn't? yeah she should just ask him and get er him to ask or
A	yeah
B	something I used to do all the shopping for
A	did you?
B	and I enjoyed it but like he just he just never did it so I was like fine I'll do it cos it's a joint thing anyway so I just did it anyway
A	yeah
B	and then he was like all offended cos they loved it and like he wasn't getting any credit and I was like well you didn't help in the first place
B	so
A	oh I still haven't got a birthday card off my brother and
B	really?
A	yeah
B	that's awful like if you didn't give them one or something
A	I know yeah
B	all hell would break loose
A	I know I sent we sent them a Christmas card to
B	yeah
A	they'll probably've received that but they still haven't sent my birthday card
B	that's really bad
A	yeah I thought so it would've
B	yeah
A	I think they'd've quite enjoyed doing that too
B	oh well it's not worth it anyway
A	it'll be nice to see them at Christmas what are you doing for Christmas?
B	I'm going to the same place I did last year the
A	yeah
B	erm we're there for three nights like we got a good deal and like all the food's included so there's like afternoon tea on arrival and like carols
A	ah
A	yeah
B	er like a four course Christmas lunch and then like cheese and crackers and stuff
A	oh that'll be nice
B	and then on Boxing Day I'll go to the gym like I did last year and like erm get a massage and go in the spa
A	oh lovely
B	erm and we'll
A	yeah yeah
B	cos I have such a small family but it's nice for you with the girls isn't it?
A	yeah
B	but I don't have that so
B	yeah
A	oh my god I mean it's just it's like any other meal really like there's no need to get
B	there is a lot to do but yeah
A	so stressed out about it it just sort of spoils
B	I know that's why I insist on going away now because it was quite cold actually and we spent all that time
A	ah
B	and I was just like it's there's no point really it's nice to be waited on
A	yeah
B	we were gonna go back to New York like cos we er got a good deal but
A	did you go to New York at Christmas then the last time you were? oh wow
B	yeah like actually this was like a couple of years ago
A	I've always wanted to go to New York
B	two thousand and eleven or something?
A	yeah
B	something like that two thousand and ten maybe it was quite a long time ago
A	mm
B	but it was just amazing we went to the Hilton on Christmas Day
A	oh wow
B	erm and ice skating and stuff Central Park
A	ah lovely
B	but erm yeah I'll do it again
A	and was it really? was it really cold?
B	there was a snowstorm so like all the cars were covered up completely
A	oh wow
B	and we couldn't go to the Statue of Liberty that's why I wanna go back cos we didn't get to do quite a lot of stuff cos the weather
A	yeah yeah
B	all the subways were covered in ice
B	really?
A	for quite a long time she just said it was so cold
B	oh wow
A	like you just couldn't warm up
B	yeah yeah
A	in the winters obviously
B	yeah it's boiling during the summer it's like proper seasonal there
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	I like that having actual seasons
A	yeah
B	whereas it's just all cold here
A	and how much were flights to New York?
B	well
A	mm
B	it's quite a lot isn't it?
A	yeah it is quite expensive
B	that's why I was like kicking myself because it was fifteen hundred for a four star hotel right by the Empire State and flights
A	wow
B	for like four nights this year but obviously travel with like the whole ISIS thing isn't
A	yeah it is a bit
B	so
A	dodgy I was a bit weird about going to
B	well yeah
A	a likely spot for an attack
B	there's loads going on like there isn't there?
A	yeah
A	yeah like the building we went for breakfast in is like one of the really high  rise buildings so
B	yeah
A	they have like security scanners and
B	yeah
A	you know? like walk through scanning machines which is good
B	yeah
A	like it makes you feel a bit more secure
B	yeah
B	ah
A	just before
B	just
A	yeah just
B	she's probably quite young
A	I think she goes to the cinema and stuff and she went to the theatre with us when
B	did she?
A	it was funny actually
B	does she not get really bored though?
A	no no she was fine actually
B	oh right
A	yeah we went to see a play and erm it was a bit of an odd play actually it wasn't really for children it was like marketed towards children but it was a bit scary
B	yeah yeah
A	and they had like people like coming up the aisles like going over to the children and stuff
A	and
B	yeah
A	and left little
B	yeah I can imagine her yeah I can imagine her doing that
A	it was funny
A	but yeah they were both really good
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	a bit creepy
B	well I find that with erm what was I watching the other day? oh you know Wallace and Gromit?
A	yeah
B	I was watching that and it's actually really dark like I didn't really realise
A	yeah
B	I haven't seen it in a while for like for children to watch it
A	yeah
A	yeah a few like children shows are like that
B	Disney movies they're quite dark messages Disney movies
A	yeah I really want to see Krampus at the cinema that's like a Christmassy film
B	I'm sorry but Christmas is a joyous time not for a horror movie
A	yeah it'll be good
B	it's not for me at all
A	you're such a little scaredy cat
B	I hate horror movies literally watched House of Wax when I was like twelve
B	and I still have nightmares about it I really do not like it
A	oh my god
B	I find torture like chopping off limbs so unnecessary
A	oh yeah
B	like the James Bond movies have just got so violent there's no point like
A	yeah
B	I just don't get how people can do that to other people it's horrible
A	yeah
B	hate it
A	no I used to be fine with horror movies but they do scare me a little bit
B	mm
A	now it's like The Ring and stuff like that
B	some of them are fine it's just the chopping off limbs I hate
B	like you know? like Saw can't deal with that
A	yeah
B	but if it's just like I don't know
A	did you?
B	I was laughing the whole way through it was like
A	well some of them are just pretty stupid aren't they?
B	yeah
A	no I think we should go and see it
B	yeah no I won't be
B	no Christmas is meant to be like you know? health and oh The Holiday was on last night I was watching that
A	oh was it?
B	yeah
A	oh I missed that
B	it's my favourite Christmas movie
A	oh oh I love all the Christmas films
B	yeah oh I'm just gonna actually remind my mum to record Masterchef
A	oh is that on tonight?
B	yeah it's on every night
A	oh right
B	she's got
A	oh does she?
B	yeah
A	what's she doing with
B	well I don't know what the weather was like over there but they they trust us that much they've given us a key to their house how nice is that?
A	oh that's good
B	yeah
A	do they live in
B	erm what's it called?
A	erm
B	you know? just outside
A	I never drive up that way
B	thingy bridge
A	I really don't know
B	I really er my
A	it's not like
B	no no it's like just er just past
A	and not it's not
B	no it's before you get to
A	oh I don't know I'm not sure
B	yeah well they own their own business don't they? but it's erm
A	yeah
B	it's lovely it's so nice it's probably like eight hundred thousand
A	mm good grief do they just?
B	they have like a pond and
A	do they just have the
B	just the
A	mm
B	but that's doing well obviously as you know
A	oh yeah
B	so yeah
A	I'm still waiting for our free meal there
B	yeah I know well we get free coffee but
A	yeah free meal would be nice
B	I mean I don't know if we went in for dinner they'd probably give us a discount I'm sure
A	yeah
B	but erm yeah
A	ah so how often are you seeing her now? it seems to be all the time
A	yeah
B	well
A	mm
B	and then obviously when I'm home erm I'm only
A	ah
B	but yeah it's a nice little arrangement
A	do you think you'll get like a dog any time soon if
B	think it'll have to be when I move out because obviously the renting situation
A	yeah
B	so that's a shame
A	so did they say a definite no then?
B	she didn't no she just didn't get back to us
A	oh
B	so I assume erm you know? for the amount we're paying and like we're obviously really close like my mum buys them Christmas presents
A	does she?
B	like they're really close like they they meet up and stuff because
A	oh right
B	like her and her husband and my mum and dad like you'd think she'd you know?
A	yeah be a bit more laid back
B	yeah exactly she knows like we're not gonna do anything that's gonna oh well it's fine
A	oh that's a shame
B	I'll just get one myself
A	yeah
B	but she's so funny
A	ah
B	a little puppy came in yesterday erm to the
A	ah
B	she's a lovely dog
A	I really want a dog
B	mm
A	so have you thought about where you're gonna live next year if you stay in
B	er grad college
A	are you?
B	I wasn't gonna pay but I I think
A	mm
B	cos my internet's so bad I just can't really do you know what I mean? and er I
A	yeah is it expensive?
B	er I think it's just the same really as the dorms but it's it's a nicer standard
A	yeah it looks really
B	you've got the
A	is it quite new? the grad college?
B	yeah yeah I think so they've updated it yeah
A	yeah yeah I haven't been in but it looks nice
B	you know? it's a couple of thousand pounds more in debt than I already am so it won't make much difference
B	to be honest I probably won't pay it back anyway
B	erm
A	oh right okay so similar to mine then?
B	mm
A	what? and then you'll do your LPC after that will you?
B	well the LPC qualifies me as a solicitor but erm the masters isn't a full masters so you're paying for that with the element of risk that you might not get a training contract
A	right
B	so if I do a masters I can do anything with that and then if I get a training contract then they'll pay for me to do the LPC
A	yeah that's good
A	so you'll apply
B	so I think I'd prefer to do that really than the
A	you'll apply for the training contract before you do your masters will you?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	but you have to do
A	yeah
B	it's a bit ridiculous
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	I'll have to erm start applying for assistant psychologist post
B	yeah when are you doing that?
A	well
B	mm
A	I think I
B	yeah
A	then we graduate in September so I guess like over the summer I can start sort of applying for things
B	yeah
A	and see if anything comes up there's actually been I I actually got two interviews like just I'd I applied for them like just before I started my masters cos I thought
B	yeah
A	well if I did get one
B	yeah
A	like I'd probably go for that instead of doing my masters
B	yeah
A	but yeah as soon as I started I got two interviews in like the same week
B	mm
A	it's just typical isn't it? like you
B	did you not go? no?
A	well no there was no point then cos I'd paid all my fees and everything
B	just yeah but you don't know though that you they could've said well we'll have you after your masters if you impressed them
A	no I don't it it doesn't really work like that
B	yeah
A	I think they needed someone there and then really
A	but yeah yeah it was
B	where were where were they at then?
A	I think one was in
B	mm
A	and then oh I think one might've been in like
B	oh you said that
A	yeah
B	oh right yeah would you move there then?
A	I don't know like it's a bit of a commute isn't it? but
B	yeah yeah
A	yeah maybe
B	yeah people like live in
A	I think
B	cos it's so much cheaper
A	yeah yeah
A	I think I'll just have to apply like everywhere after I graduate though and see
B	yeah
A	but there has there's there's been more jobs available round here lately I've noticed
B	has there?
A	yeah
A	for assistant psychologist posts
B	oh right whereabouts then? like round Edinburgh way or?
A	no round us like
B	oh right
B	yeah
A	like
A	yeah so it's looking a bit more promising really
B	I think it's improving now isn't it? cos
A	yeah hopefully
B	mm
