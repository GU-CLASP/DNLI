[ANNOTATION]	They should put it back in the oven because it is undercooked.	Contradiction
A	so it's just been resting for a minute cos they keep cooking don't they in the foil?
B	yeah
A	yeah a bit different
B	yeah
A	it's an easy recipe if you ever want to do it
B	oh
A	cos you just
B	yes I always
A	no and it's very British isn't it?
[ANNOTATION]	It is an easy recipe quite common in Britain.	Entailment
B	yeah absolutely

B	no er
A	okay and there's do you want the juice or not?
B	oh a little bit of juice'll be fine

B	yes
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B does not like peppers very much.	Entailment
A	yeah
B	yeah I don't mind that

B	oh that's fine
[ANNOTATION]	Shepherd's pie is one of the most English recipes.	Neutral
A	I haven't put any salt
A	you don't? I didn't think you did
B	no no no
A	there you go so there's more
B	oh
A	more of the fish sauce if you would like it
B	oh
A	I've got one too
[ANNOTATION]	When cooking, they did not add any salt.	Entailment
A	but if it's too much then you can always leave it I've done you quite a lot of potatoes so so if you don't want them just leave them

B	yes it's fine yes
A	ah good
B	it was falling apart when I put the knife in it
A	oh that's good
A	it's the thing with fish it's easy to cook but then it's easy to overcook or undercook it
B	open the oven
A	overcooking you've had it
B	oh that's right
A	no no it doesn't have any flavour then
B	no ooh that's lovely flavour
A	is it nice? oh good

B	oh
A	cos the builders had filled the garden with rubble
B	did you manage to buy some
A	I got some free
B	did you?
A	yes
B	oh
A	cos it doesn't keep so once people have bought it that's it
B	mm
A	yeah
B	is it dear to buy?
A	sorry?
B	does it cost a lot to buy?
A	it's expensive because it's heavy
B	yeah
A	it's like top soil top soil's surprisingly
B	oh I see yeah
A	the expense of storing it and moving it I suppose
B	oh actually little
A	he loves it doesn't he?

A	put
B	oh no
A	mm
B	yeah
A	I thought you did
B	yeah ah used to grow parsley years ago
A	I couldn't remember whether tomatoes so I thought well you always have tomatoes
B	I like tomatoes yeah yeah
A	so you probably
A	mum
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B likes tomatoes because their mother used to do a great gazpacho.	Neutral
B	oh
A	she doesn't really like them
B	oh
A	or doesn't like them cooked she'll eat them raw
B	that's very nice that salmon
A	oh good
B	got some lemon in there
A	yes and I've given you a wedge on the side in case you want more but I just chopped a few bits up
[ANNOTATION]	They have not put any lemon because speaker A is allergic to it.	Contradiction
B	that's nice yeah no no
A	do you cook fish?
B	erm do I cook fish?
A	but you eat it a lot though don't you?
B	oh yes I do erm I do buy it yes
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B doesn't eat fish because they dislike the texture.	Contradiction
B	but it's I use by the time I left
A	oh that's a good idea
B	mm
A	mm
B	I don't
A	there is one over there but it's not plugged in I don't think
B	ah is it
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	They unplugged it when they left.	Neutral
B	used to get tired of going over to it
A	yes I expect so
B	yeah
A	I expect grandma used to send you
B	well that's right
A	useful though to have a big freezer
B	yeah
A	cos you then you can just do a really big shop once a month and buy all the meat for the whole month can't you? and all the fish
B	yeah
A	oh really?
B	yeah
A	ah
B	flying over just
A	ah right mm
A	mm that's nice
B	you have
A	we get buzzards
B	buzzards flying over yeah yeah
A	mm
B	oh do they?
A	mm
B	oh crows
A	crows don't like them
B	oh can't have that then can we now?
A	no
B	no
A	or eat the young ones

A	scary yes
B	probably
A	did you want butter for your potatoes?
B	erm no I'm fine
A	oh right okay
B	yeah
A	oh good
B	yeah
A	I like it
B	yeah
A	it's how it should be
B	mm
A	know it's cooked then
B	yeah
A	very slowly and then it just falls off the bone
B	do you cook a lot of lamb? er
A	not a lot I should do it cos it's actually
B	oh no
A	easy lamb chops are very easy
A	but my favourite is lamb shank
B	oh
A	but you have to cook it for about five hours
B	was that
A	oh right
B	so
A	mm
B	yes
[ANNOTATION]	they are not sure about time of cook	Neutral
A	actually I haven't looked there is one in Exeter I've seen
B	oh I see yeah
A	erm
B	well you're gonna have some shops I suppose
A	yes white right where I am it there's nothing really
B	no no
A	just a Co-op and you know it's all
B	oh
A	erm the Tesco's isn't bad for fish though
B	oh
A	mm
B	yep
A	yes it seems quite fresh there
B	yeah Morrison's yes
[ANNOTATION]	they are not sure about fish	Neutral
A	mm
B	no
A	if I must try
B	well in Exeter well it
A	yes they've got a good one I've seen one
B	yeah I expect so yeah
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about fish	Entailment
A	mm
B	beef steaks
A	no I don't do that much but that's another easy meal
A	it is actually
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	oh yes yes
A	do you like lamb?
B	yes I like all meat well I think I prefer er
A	mm
B	yes
A	I do
B	very seldom
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	they are not sure what kind of meat is good	Neutral
A	oh right oh that's nice
B	yeah
A	and chicken?
B	well well I don't know it's
A	yes
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about chicken	Entailment
B	so
A	it gets a bit boring
A	ah right well it's the cheapest meat as well isn't it?
B	yeah
A	apart from mince mince is very cheap
[ANNOTATION]	they are not sure about cheapest meat	Neutral
B	yes it used to be the dearest you know
A	it's funny isn't it? yes and things like salmon used to be very expensive but actually now it's very affordable
B	I mean years ago it used to be chicken for Sundays
A	mm
B	yeah it's changed now
A	yeah that's factory farming though isn't it? they can just do it on mass
B	do you remember your auntie
A	yeah I remember her mm
B	yeah
A	ah right
B	did he keep them?
A	but not for meat for eggs
B	oh for eggs yeah
A	mm
B	they used to keep them for eggs
A	oh that's nice
B	with
A	well they do taste different
B	yes
A	I I won't buy normal eggs I'll only buy free range but even then they're not fresh
B	oh yeah
A	mm
B	oh
A	it's only about twenty P more expensive to get them off the farms and I do pass once a week so I could easily pick up half a dozen
B	I think I
A	ah right
B	oh
A	mm
A	I suppose it's an easy number isn't it?
B	do you have a favourite meal yourself then?
A	I do like fish
B	oh yes
A	this is a lovely meal
B	this is very tasty
A	mm I like salmon
B	oh
A	mm
B	yeah
A	they're not even close
B	occasionally
A	ah yes that's quite nice
A	yes that's not bad
B	yeah
A	do you like lamb chops?
B	yeah quite nice lamb chops
A	mm
A	mm
B	oh ho
A	oh I love it yeah
B	mm

B	awesome breakfasts
A	do you like the English breakfast?
B	yeah er yeah
A	yeah
B	yes
A	mm
B	do you? well
A	I never make it for breakfast
B	very nutritious eating eggs actually
A	yes
B	mm
A	and if you have too many potatoes you know if you cook too many the day before you can use them the next day for the breakfast
B	oh
A	cos they're already cooked so you only need to fry them
B	I'm not very good
A	yeah
B	no no
A	so you've really got to think I'm gonna have that for breakfast tomorrow and then
B	you don't have yesterday's dinner for breakfast do you?
A	no
B	I was gonna say
A	but only the potatoes
B	oh potato
A	potatoes you could do
B	yeah
A	yeah mum's a good cook
B	yeah
A	but she doesn't really like cooking
B	doesn't really
A	no she doesn't enjoy it she says
B	yeah
A	I suppose it's different
B	well I think your dad does a bit of cooking occasionally maybe
A	mm
B	if
A	he's not bad mm
B	well I think I think
A	mm
A	now don't feel you have to eat it all cos I gave you loads of potatoes
B	they're very nice potatoes
A	are they good? cos they're they're new ones
B	yeah they're very nice
A	they're in season at the moment
B	oh
A	no
B	oh no
A	no it's a shame cos new potatoes are delicious
B	oh
A	new carrots are delicious
B	oh they're much better than
A	mm
B	yeah
A	yes I've put onions in and I've put potatoes in this year
B	have you?
A	mm only half a dozen plants
B	yeah
A	but erm
B	for breaking it up yeah
A	yeah and you don't have to dig it so that's what I've done
B	oh
A	and I've put Jerusalem artichokes in
B	what? er
A	they're
B	oh yeah
A	erm
B	oh
A	it's sort of a a posh potato I think
B	what did we used to have erm
A	oh I like those yeah do you like them?
A	mm
A	mm I like them
B	you really like them?
A	they used to be really expensive here but they're cheap at the moment
B	are they?
A	I don't quite know
B	I know I mean when mum's in Kenya that's when
A	oh right oh yes
B	yes mm
A	I suppose she doesn't like them
B	they've never been back either to that part of the world
A	no I think she's in two minds cos she feels
B	oh really?
A	if she goes back it will have changed and that might spoil her memories
B	well it is actually like that cos I
A	you've been to China a few times
B	yeah
A	ah right
B	and when I went next time round they've got a family there and they're
A	yes
B	yeah that's right
A	it might be nice to leave it as it was
B	oh
A	well it's quite a safe option I think cos Kenya's not actually that safe at the moment
B	oh really?
A	it's not the best place to go
A	Uganda's safer than Kenya now which is a
B	well it used to be awful in Uganda
A	that's right yeah so that's the other way round now but Tanzania's a good option
B	yeah mm
A	ah right
B	and then and then
A	yes
B	yeah and
A	ah
B	is that
A	yes
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	well it's a long way from er Cairo but it's not far
A	ah
A	take your time I'm a fast eater
B	oh yes I
A	I gobble my food
B	yes but you you you're dad's a very quick eater
A	yeah I am and I need to slow down actually
B	oh
A	it's not very good for you to eat quickly you should eat slower
B	I think
A	they tell you to eat slowly
B	yeah oh well
A	she was very slow
B	yeah
A	yes
A	no she didn't have very good digestion
B	so she grew up on vegetables cos her father used to grow most of them
A	ah right
B	yeah
A	ah maybe that's where I get it from?
B	oh you
B	yeah
A	soft fruit you used to have a lot of currants
B	yes
A	yeah you used to have the cages didn't you?
B	yeah oh those
A	yes
B	when was did we have cages?
A	that was here by the tennis court
B	oh was it?
A	I expect they've all gone now cos
B	oh yes that's on the side there
A	yeah
B	I was gonna say we used to
A	oh right
A	mm
B	cos mum
A	those trees got too big here though didn't they? those leylandii they probably
B	oh a lot of Leylandii
A	took over
B	yes
A	good for privacy though
B	you your actually your grandma never
A	ah right
B	cos erm
A	yes
B	and she used to erm
A	oh that's nice
B	sell them for charity
A	oh that's lovely
B	well she used to put them on the table by the big gates
A	yes
B	and erm with erm
A	that's nice
B	just trust that no one pinches them
A	yes now I was
A	it's funny actually just the other day I was
B	yeah
A	thinking of doing plant sales from the house cos no one does it round by me there's not anywhere
B	have you got any
A	loads of houses round by me and there's no shops
B	oh well
A	so it's too late this year but if I did it next year you could start them indoors
B	yeah
A	yes and just put it on the internet and people would come round I'm sure
B	yeah
A	so a pound but you'd be selling them for well minimum fifty P I don't think erm people will pay a pound probably wouldn't they?
B	yeah
A	so that's a good mark up
B	I just there's still the same firm now actually
A	yes
A	that's a good mark up cos a packet of seeds
B	yeah
A	you get about fifty so even if only half of them grew
B	oh well
A	that's a huge mark up
B	it's amazing how many you do get actually
A	you get hundreds sometimes you don't know what to do with them all
B	used to put them in a tray to kick off with years ago
A	yes I do that in the kitchen
B	do you do that?
A	yeah I've got marigolds in the kitchen
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	so they're just they're about that big now
B	oh oh
A	the English marigolds the
B	yeah
A	sort of that height
B	yeah
A	with orange flowers
B	I remember all that cos
A	mm
B	and we went through the top
A	that's a long way
B	and we
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Person A is going to dance	Contradiction
B	those Indian hotels
A	ah right with marigolds?
B	marigolds
A	oh right yes
B	yeah there were loads
A	ah they were probably the French ones
B	oh yeah yeah yeah
A	yeah cos they they're the smaller ones that you can do in a garland
B	oh are they? yeah I'd forgotten
A	the English ones I was reading the other day
B	oh
A	and they were put in every kind of winter casserole the flowers were
[ANNOTATION]	Person A is going to have a sandwich	Contradiction
B	oh
A	a spoon of
B	oh right that
A	it's interesting isn't it?
B	I just thought
A	yes
[ANNOTATION]	Person A is feeling so bad about the things that Person C said	Contradiction
B	yeah I
A	ah right yes I've got loads of seeds I need to get them in but we still had frost last week
B	oh
A	so you can't really sow outdoors while you've got the frost
B	no you nip them in the bud that's right yeah
A	yes
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Person B believe that the gap is useful for him	Contradiction
A	probably that might if we're lucky be the last frost but it snowed this week didn't it in a lot of the UK?
B	has
A	yes you can get the sort of
B	yeah
A	either horticulture or fleece
B	I'd forgotten
A	I suppose you had the greenhouse too you could of
B	oh
A	oh it was nice it was over there
[ANNOTATION]	Person A not sure about the GP's of the sister of their friend that is one year younger	Contradiction
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	not there any more though
A	no
B	no
A	mum likes her greenhouse now
B	oh
A	it is convenient
[ANNOTATION]	Person A think that it is as convenient as her green house	Entailment
B	yes
A	yeah I love it absolutely love it
B	it is
A	mm
A	I wish I had a bigger garden but
B	yeah
A	that's the only thing where I am
B	well grandma always used to make it
A	ah yeah
B	well on the one side where we have a
A	that's right loads of bulbs weren't there?
B	oh oh oh lilies
A	tulips and all sorts
B	big lilies this side
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about garden	Contradiction
A	yeah lovely
B	oh have you? oh
A	yes cos that's really English country garden
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about England garden	Entailment
B	oh
A	do you remember the song?
A	and that's in there isn't it?
A	daffodils
B	oh
A	what's the next bit?
B	oh
A	yes I thought I'd buy a lot of those seeds actually erm cos once they're in
B	yeah
A	it's easy
B	yeah
A	I think they biannual so they'll they'll last several years
B	yeah your mum
A	yes she is
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about bit	Neutral
A	mm
B	and mum went to congratulate him
B	and then she told him she was a music teacher
A	ah
B	yeah
A	yeah I met
B	mm
A	I had a lady stay with me last night and she'd spent about eight years working on cruise ships round the world
A	cos you know long hours but she was a masseuse on them
[ANNOTATION]	person A know she was masseuse	Neutral
B	oh
A	but I said that must have been really tough because you know it's hard on your arms isn't it?
B	yeah yeah
A	if you did that all day long you'd be exhausted
[ANNOTATION]	person A know if you work hard be exhausted	Entailment
B	yes they they work hard on those boats
A	they do and that's a very physical job
A	using only certain muscles
B	a lot of them on there are people from South America like on those boats
A	ah right yeah
[ANNOTATION]	they are not sure about boats	Neutral
B	we always found
A	yeah
B	and er where did we see them?
A	mm
B	sort of South American
A	yes
B	but they're always very nice people
A	yeah
B	and mum always got along well with everybody
A	ah that's nice
B	she's able to you know she also said she was
A	yeah
B	but no longer is she said
A	ah
B	yeah
A	what my mum?
B	your mum yes
A	yes that's right I thought that recently
B	I think I think
A	that's what I
B	as a headmaster yeah
A	yes I don't think he was really shy
B	no
A	I think it was more stress
A	yes cos he says in the supermarket he never goes to those checkouts where you
B	no I can't really
A	he always goes to the ones with people
B	honestly there can't put my head inside those
A	oh yeah the first time it takes forever cos you don't know what to do
A	but now they've got a new thing where they given you a scanner when you go in if you want not in Morrison's they do this in Tesco and you scan the food as you go round and put it in your bags
B	but if you forget to put something on your
A	I know yeah they do they and the thing is they don't check that often so it would be quite easy to do
B	yeah yeah
A	er but they do random checks so maybe every four times you shop there
B	yeah
A	but yes I expect that does happen it's quite easy to do cos I realised the other day
B	oh ho
A	because I put I scanned it so I thought that was it yeah
B	yeah you went back the next day and paid did you?
A	so that was no good
B	oh
A	yeah well I realised when I got to the till so it was okay
B	yeah
A	I thought well where are those on? cos it shows you what you've bought before you pay and I thought where are the banana's?
B	oh yeah
B	yeah yeah
A	so that means nine people have lost their jobs
A	ah
B	he sort of recognised me
A	yes
B	he said I remember you coming with your wife
A	ah that's nice
B	so pleased to go there
A	yeah that's lovely
B	but oh no
A	ah yes they've they've changed to Morrison's now
B	yes that's right
B	yes yes Somerfield's
A	or was it
B	where you could call them up used
A	I think so
B	dunno what happened
A	I think so I'm not sure what happened to that one I have oh maybe that's become Co-op?
B	oh did they?
A	and Safeway merged with Morrison's or it might be the other way round
B	oh yes it's really
A	there's really only four supermarkets in the running
B	well
A	yes
B	you know
A	that's right
B	well you're lucky to find anything you want
A	well that's what I think I mean it is for some things it is cheaper but I mean you could hardly do a big shop there
B	mm
A	I mean I went the other day and I tried to buy natural yogurt they didn't have any
B	no
A	how can you not have natural yogurt? that's just
B	yeah yeah
A	you know it's not a fancy thing it's and the same with the fruit and veg
B	oh yeah I know this guy
A	yeah
B	he said now today it's nowhere near as good as it was but in in
A	that's right
B	years ago
A	yes
B	erm
A	so we talk about competition but there isn't really much not with the supermarkets
B	no not a lot no no
A	but they are competing more with each other I suppose
B	well I know er
A	mm
B	the
A	and farmers too actually
B	yeah I know they we used to
A	yeah
B	and we used to go and meet up in in
A	yes
B	good pricing I mean
A	yes cos they'll really
B	and he was
A	squeeze them won't they?
A	yes
B	so
A	well a lot of them have gone haven't they? the greengrocers there used to be one on every high street but
B	yeah
A	maybe one in
B	tell me
A	I expect you've got one
A	and the market you would have stalls there wouldn't you?
A	ah right
B	yeah
A	yes
B	that has a little space outside the
A	I find them quite cheap actually
B	yeah I do I do find them yeah
A	yes yeah they can be
B	oh
A	so you wonder what's going on with them don't you?
B	well the farmers haven't got it that's for sure no no
A	that's right yeah the farmers haven't got it
A	but yes
B	do you? oh
A	yeah I don't like shopping but I like food shopping
B	oh really?
A	I never buy what I think I'm going to buy
B	Morrison's quite good for cakes and stuff
A	oh is it? ah
A	mm
B	and then the
A	yes
B	he sold cakes
A	ah right
B	erm made not too far away like
A	mm
B	and I've got more there
A	gone through all those
B	yeah
B	not particularly
A	no I didn't think you did I had a feeling you
B	old habits
A	yeah I had a feeling you didn't like spinach
A	cauliflower cheese
B	cheese that's right
A	yes
B	I'm not keen on erm the cabbages and stuff
A	no I don't
B	yes that's where your grandma loved all those things
A	yes so I thought maybe green beans was the safest
B	oh
A	oh yes they're nice aren't they?
B	yeah
A	ah right
B	oh
A	yes
B	are they?
A	yes cos they can take the nitrogen out of the air
B	oh
A	and fix it in the soil
B	if you remember the fruit cage we had here once
A	yeah I remember that one
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	I I went out to look at
A	no
B	but erm
A	that's what I remember
B	mm
A	are there any plants left there or have they all died off?
B	no
A	oh right
B	blackcurrants and raspberries and that sort of
A	oh right yeah

A	mm
A	mm
B	and nettles and brambles and
A	yes
B	no
A	mum loves nettle soup
A	mm
B	oh yeah
A	it's a very similar flavour
B	I don't like the cabbage family at all
A	no well if you don't like spinach you've had
B	no
A	then you're definitely not but nettles are incredibly good for you
B	oh that's
A	and vitamin C yes exactly it's very good for your heart and your blood and the thing with iron apparently if you don't have enough vitamin C
B	oh
A	taking iron tablets you've got to have fruit and veg with it or you won't absorb it
B	oh
A	and cheap as well
B	oh yeah get a freebie yeah
A	that's right so I might go and pick some actually I was thinking next week and make some soup
B	yes yes grandma was always picking stuff from the hedges
A	oh did she? oh
B	yeah
A	yeah I do that as well
B	yeah well
A	I tried primroses the other day
B	you can't make
A	no but you can eat the flowers
B	can you?
A	delicious absolutely delicious
B	oh
A	I'll go and pick one for you later
B	and you cook it do you?
A	no just eat it raw
B	oh put me off
A	taste like sunshine
B	oh
B	yeah
A	very very sweet
B	oh
A	yeah
B	your
A	yeah and I'm I'm quite interested in things you can't buy cos there are some foods even though they grow around you
B	yeah
A	has it? ah
B	come
A	is that every day?
B	at least five
A	well that's pretty good isn't it?
B	I think I don't think they have it on Mondays as far as I can remember
A	ah right
B	but the rest of the week they're there
A	have they got a livestock market?
B	yeah
A	yes cos I passed on the
B	yeah
A	on the right I thought oh that's that probably used to be
B	er well
A	where they held them
B	well that's quick though they have sales there now
A	oh do they? oh interesting
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yes
B	yeah
A	he loves shopping
A	and mum misses it actually
B	oh right
A	cos she stopped doing it for a while cos he wasn't working
B	what he wants
A	yes
A	do you like food shopping?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	I quite enjoy it
B	yeah
A	that's on special offer
B	well I
A	no
B	when
A	yes
B	but I
A	oh that's nice
B	because she
A	yeah
B	and all these
A	yes
B	no not in
A	with the cataracts so she probably had trouble seeing the money actually
B	yes exactly
A	mm
B	did I have one?
A	you did actually yeah
B	I've got
A	I think you still have but they said they
B	oh well that's what I said
A	no
B	wouldn't improve it wouldn't get worse
A	no but then it was alright
B	well it was
A	ah right
B	a couple of years back
A	yeah that's good well it's as long as you go for regular check ups that's okay
B	and she
A	yeah
B	they also get them from eye opticians don't they?
A	ah yes
B	they sell
A	yes
B	and then they get
A	your hearing's good isn't it?
B	oh it's not bad oh
A	yes
A	you can get free hearing tests in your home now Specsavers will come to your house and test your hearing for free
A	but you don't need it
B	yeah they that's funny you say it but I've just remembered it now living with with your
A	mm
B	used to come out to see her especially
A	ah that's good
B	only had
A	yeah
B	yeah for hearing that's right
A	oh for hearing yeah that's good
B	yeah
A	yeah I saw that the other day I thought that was very good
A	going to people's houses is sensible because I mean the people who have trouble are probably older
B	oh people's houses
A	and they probably can't go out very easily they might not be able to drive or
B	no mm
A	might not be able to get around easily so that's good
B	I think actually
A	mm
B	grandma did think she's er well
A	yeah I pay with a card
A	do you?
B	er oh
A	yeah ah right okay
A	you can't really go wrong with cards
B	no no you you can always go back can't you?
A	and yes you can always go back with the card
B	yeah
A	and actually in terms of consumer protection
B	oh
A	so if anything goes wrong
B	mm
A	so actually they always tell you pay for big purchases on a card
B	to pay
A	especially a credit card because that's a sort of
B	oh won't won't be paying
A	it's more difficult to get your money back
B	yeah
A	yeah so I tend to buy everything on a card now
B	oh well
A	and you get a few perks with it
B	oh yeah well I think Morrison did points did they?
A	ah yes they do points yeah
B	yeah I think so
A	yes that's good
B	and we
A	I don't know
B	yeah yeah
A	yes

A	mm

B	oh oh
A	maybe not that often
A	mm
B	yeah
A	oh do you? oh that's nice
B	yeah

B	I thought it might have
A	mm
B	I didn't top up mine up yet
A	mm
B	beautiful
A	is it good?
B	yeah marvellous
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B has topped up his/her cider.	Entailment
A	oh good
B	lovely flavour couldn't be better
A	rhubarb
B	that's oh that's a lovely flavour that
A	oh good
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B hasn't topped up his/her cider.	Entailment
B	you have to put sugar with it or not?
A	it's not
B	yes
A	mm
B	yeah
A	is it alright?
B	yes
A	but then there's sugar in the crumble itself
B	yeah
A	so I suppose it offsets
B	ah mm
A	mm well it's lucky cos the crumble didn't sink
B	yeah
A	sometimes I've made it and the crumble ends up at the bottom
B	yes grandma was brought up on rhubarb
A	mm
A	it's not actually an English vegetable I think it's Chinese
B	is it? oh
A	mm
A	but cultivated for a long time in the UK
A	mm
B	yeah
A	mm that's right
B	I'd forgotten you went to China of course you did didn't you? yeah
A	mm
B	yeah
A	when she lived in Shanghai
B	oh I remember Shanghai
A	mm
B	you looked out over the water and these boats coming out
A	yeah I liked it there
B	and
A	oh right
B	because well this is just erm
A	mm
B	and
A	ah right
B	and they used to congregate round mum and it frightened the life out of her
A	ah
B	yeah well grandma I should say
A	yeah that's right they did crowd around us when we were there
B	yeah
A	yeah just pointing they'd never seen a foreigner I suppose
B	oh
A	erm I expect it's changed now
B	well I remember going to the market one day a Chinese one
A	mm
B	and the lady was selling rats
B	had them all round her all round her waist
A	what to eat?
B	to eat yeah
A	oh dear
B	yeah
A	I saw a dog actually in the market
B	oh did you? oh
A	for sale mm
B	mum was always terrified with dogs when we were abroad in case if they bit you
A	ah that's right rabies
B	yeah rabies and so on
A	mm
A	that's right yeah
B	oh yeah
A	mm
B	yeah
B	and she's talking to them
A	no I expect she was good
B	did you do French at school?
A	yes but I never got on with it
B	no
A	no I never liked French
B	who do they have?
A	ah right
A	ah
B	The Telegraph
A	the French teacher?
B	er yeah she did she did the language
A	mm
B	oh and also plays and stuff
A	oh right
B	yeah
A	mm
B	course your mum used to do some of those plays at school
A	oh
B	well
A	mm
B	and they used to tie up with the erm
A	ah right
B	and and so if and they were given a concert at the Catholic end somewhere
A	mm
B	when the school was there
A	ah right oh yes I bet they liked that
B	they didn't
A	oh right
B	but honestly I was shouting at er
B	yes yes
A	that's nice
B	but I
A	mm
B	and er
A	ah
B	and
A	yeah
B	and she'd won a prize
A	ah right oh that's good
B	and I said well I unfortunately pulled her leg I said well it's a Catholic
A	no mum's not bad is she?
B	no
A	mm
B	they used to say she was very very shy when she was young
A	yes
B	mm
A	that's right yeah it's funny
B	she talks to anyone now doesn't she?
A	yes that's right nice
B	and then when we go on these cruise ships
A	yes
B	cos she's got about three thousand people to talk to
A	just move on
B	yeah mm
B	and she does always talk with some of the people
A	yeah oh right
B	you know people who've been playing the piano
A	yes
B	I think once she said
B	and they'd looked rather surprised that mum knew enough about it
B	so she explained
A	oh right well that's good
A	yeah and
B	yes yes she still does doesn't she? yeah
A	mm
B	yes is is
A	yeah they did
B	mm
A	yeah they played her music once
B	yeah
A	she won a competition
B	was it was it in Melbourne was it?
A	mm
B	yeah that's right
A	yes she did very well
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	she came from Melbourne
A	mm that's right she did yeah
B	yeah yeah
A	well I enjoyed my crumble
B	super flavour isn't it?
B	mm yeah
A	mm brilliant
B	you
A	and actually I think it's
B	oh yeah?
A	because it's tarter the fruit's tarter so you get the very tart flavour contrasted with the sweet
B	cos it's very yes it's very distinctive
A	crumble so you get that nice balance
B	that was super
A	oh good
B	oh
A	I could tell and I thought ah that's nice rhubarb there
B	well it's nice to see the
A	mm it looked fresh
B	in the supermarket?
A	mm
B	oh er yes sorry
A	yeah
B	well no
A	yeah
B	perhaps it hasn't
A	mm that's about half price it's only about a pound
B	oh well perhaps that's why probably not selling
A	maybe
A	oh there we go you've got a very good appetite that's good
A	I'm gonna have some more too
B	yeah thank you
A	would you like some more ice cream with it?
B	a little bit of it
A	yes
B	yes thank you
A	yes
A	or contacts
B	oh that's good going yeah
A	so erm yes if we can't eat it all that's alright erm
A	there's no point saving a tiny bit
B	no no no
A	it's a waste of time
B	tomorrow never comes
A	that's right yes there's no point it was really only
B	yeah that's lovely
A	a bit left
B	yeah
A	yes
B	oh yeah
A	I know yes
A	oh yeah
A	mm
B	mm he was worried
A	yes
A	yes they've just done their second lot of cuts but he's been alright
B	oh okay yeah so mm
A	no
B	I suppose he could always get another job anyway
A	yes he's done enough hasn't he?
A	mm I suppose the problem is
B	that's right yeah
A	so then he'd have to retrain a bit cos that's what he specialised in
B	yeah
A	but he's okay I mean he's got his degree which was not in oil it was
A	a general civil engineering degree so he could always go into construction or something
B	oh
A	mm
B	he always has long chats with him
A	yes
B	mm
A	mm
B	I think he was
A	he was a civil engineer
B	a surveyor of some sort
A	mm
B	he was in
A	mm
B	yeah
A	then in latter years he went into more
B	oh he was in bridges yeah
A	mm
B	bridges over the water
A	yes
A	there's something wrong
B	no no
A	we've just eaten a recipe for four
B	oh well
B	it's a lovely flavour
A	I really like it mm
A	you'll have to tell mum I made crumble
B	yeah yeah
A	she'll get worried
A	mm
B	I've never seen
A	well you say that it's funny
B	oh
A	I don't think he is no
B	I know you smell em for miles
A	and then they er they have the heads on still when they serve it you don't eat the head of course you you get rid of it but they cook it whole because it keeps its shape better it doesn't dry out
B	oh
A	mm it's a very Spanish thing isn't it?
B	yeah
A	do you like them?
B	sardines? yeah I think
A	mm
A	I like them
B	yeah
A	mm
A	cheap fish
A	mm
B	is it still sort of out in the open in Spain?
A	er some places
B	ah
A	yeah yeah they do
B	this is lovely
A	oh good I'm glad you like it
B	yeah
A	my first attempt at rhubarb crumble I've only ever done apple and things
B	oh
A	but this was Jamie Oliver's recipe so if it went wrong I would have blamed him
B	it's him?
A	yeah it would have been his fault
A	yeah he's got excellent
B	oh
A	and just
B	oh
A	most of it you can prepare in about five minutes
B	grandma used to have a book here
A	mm
B	have you seen that one?
A	mm
B	yeah it's nice
A	I have
A	no I expect she knew a lot of the recipes didn't she?
B	oh yes yeah
A	mum's like that she's got them all in her head
B	oh
B	erm
A	oh do you? okay
B	you know a fish
A	mm
B	cos there's several ways of cooking
A	mm
A	my favourite way is in the oven though
B	yeah
A	just wrap it up like that in foil
A	you can't go wrong mm
B	yeah that's right
[ANNOTATION]	Cooking in the oven is great.	Entailment
A	otherwise it can dry out
B	I always put silver paper in
A	mm
B	do you put yours in the oven or the grill?
A	I like the oven best
B	yes
A	I do grill
A	salmon I much prefer in the oven
[ANNOTATION]	Cooking on a grill is very bad.	Neutral
B	yes salmon
A	seabass you like don't you?
B	I like seabass yeah
A	mm
B	I can't think of the other fish we used to buy sometimes
A	mm
B	oh that was a nice fish
A	mm
B	mm
A	well we've done well between us
B	yeah
A	four portions
[ANNOTATION]	They used to buy tuna.	Neutral
A	I know
B	well yeah
A	I'd rather have this for Christmas than Christmas pudding I'm not a big fan
B	oh yeah
A	mm
A	oh really?
B	in an in a in a jar
A	oh that's nice
[ANNOTATION]	Christmas pudding is not that good.	Entailment
B	yeah so
A	ah
B	an African guy
A	ah he wouldn't know what to do with it
B	wouldn't know a thing no so it was what do I do with this tin?
A	yeah
B	then
A	well it is a funny way of cooking Christmas pudding isn't it? cos actually you boil them don't you?
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	It is normal to boil pudding.	Contradiction
A	and that's just the precooking
B	yeah I know
A	and then on the day you've got to do another two hours
B	yeah er
A	it's quite a a thing isn't it? a boiled pudding
[ANNOTATION]	Cooking Christmas pudding is fun.	Neutral
B	I think yeah oh I
A	probably did it wrong didn't they?
B	er well yeah ah no it wasn't that
A	ah
B	oh I know what's happened that's right we sent him a
A	yes
[ANNOTATION]	Person A think that they have to know what goes one after they send it	Entailment
B	and and
A	ah that was nice
B	they they even used to put them on a disc I
A	yes
B	and and he put he said he couldn't ah he couldn't do it
A	no
A	ah
B	I I I remember the African guy's family he said what's in the tin? how do I cook it?
B	yeah
A	well it is it's a very British thing isn't it a boiled pudding?
A	and I expect that was a big thing years ago but now it's only Christmas pudding isn't it we do like that? I can't think of anything else you make
B	yeah it's Christmas only
A	it's only Christmas that
B	yeah
A	mm
B	you
[ANNOTATION]	Person B think that it could be anything else but is is only Christmas	Entailment
A	oh I love that yeah
B	that was nice
A	oh good thank you Jamie Oliver
A	yes
B	you
A	no no that would take
A	but I weighed it because I think if you get it wrong with the crumble
B	yeah
A	yes
B	that that's super that one
[ANNOTATION]	Person B is going to do some hair cut	Contradiction
A	oh good
B	considering it's all gone yeah yeah
A	yeah we did well
B	oh the flavour
A	and a sweeter crumble
B	the rhubarb's quite nice too isn't it really? yeah yeah
A	I really like it yes
B	well
[ANNOTATION]	Person B said that all of it is gone and they did a good job	Entailment
A	don't see that abroad do you?
A	mm
B	oh
[ANNOTATION]	Person B is not sure what person A is talking about	Entailment
A	ah right
A	ah right
B	over there I think we used to keep it
A	yes
A	oh that's nice
B	because
A	yeah you don't see them in the shops do you?
[ANNOTATION]	Person A think that they could not find the things that they were searching for it	Neutral
B	no
A	very rarely
B	no we used to go sort of
A	oh I don't remember those
B	just
A	oh that's nice yeah
B	yeah so we
A	yes
B	right next to it's a little bit of soil there
A	mm
B	cos
A	ah right
B	mind you I was never in the garden ever
A	no
A	yeah well grandma loved it didn't she?
B	yeah
A	you used to do a lot in the garden though
B	I suppose years ago I suppose yeah
A	yeah
B	a bit more than I do now I suppose
A	yeah
A	wasn't you didn't enjoy it really
B	I wasn't keen on it
A	no I suppose grandma was more wasn't she?
B	oh she
A	yes no I really enjoy it
A	yes
A	yeah
B	she'd see mum plugging away
A	yes
B	and she didn't just call back
A	ah
B	oh she was very very shy yeah
A	yes
B	now it's
A	that's right it's funny isn't it? yes
B	it's all
A	mm
B	and she used to put on concerts for them too
A	yeah it's interesting
B	in their local chapel
A	but I suppose they were younger so maybe she felt confident
B	yes I suppose
A	she was older
B	yeah
A	mm
B	I suppose teenager
A	and they had something in common
B	yeah I suppose yeah something like
A	to focus
B	I know when we were married of course and the house
A	oh right
B	and and all the street was lined with people
A	ah that's lovely
B	because she she taught them all at Sunday school like

B	yeah
A	yeah
B	cos she when we used to say well when
A	yeah
B	she used to go over and pick up young
A	ah that's nice
B	cos she had so no one else to take her out like
A	mm
B	I think there were only two children left at that stage
A	mm
B	and the other one was a bit younger so she
A	yes
B	so yeah
A	no
B	I think I think
A	yes
B	I think we need

B	more than anything else I suppose
A	oh grandma was always good with children
B	oh she knew
A	yes
B	yeah
A	she was good with children
B	yes yes
A	mm
A	yeah
A	did grandma work during the war?

A	that was the end of that endeavour
A	yeah
B	but it was there we used to have them
A	ah oh that's nice
B	cos we had erm cottage with a
A	mm
B	and erm it erm
A	yeah
B	and then there was a little orchard at the bottom when I say little I mean
A	mm that's good
B	apple apple trees there
A	yeah
B	oh and plum trees of course
A	oh that's nice yeah
A	oh I love plums though
B	and lots of plums
A	especially the ones you get like locally
B	erm yes we didn't know what
A	no I suppose you have to
B	so I went to sell them to the market or else no one no one would buy them
A	ah
B	well oddly enough when we walked up
A	erm you've taken me there once
B	have I?
A	yes when I was quite young though with mum
B	oh
A	I think we went there yes
B	oh
A	yes
B	cos that road we were living in
A	no no you were down here must have gone up to visit I don't know why
B	oh oh well mm
A	but I would have been young maybe eight or so
B	yeah it it's
A	yes
B	then walk down to get to the buses
A	yes
B	down on
A	mm
B	and
A	yeah I haven't seen that farm no I've only seen
B	oh
A	and the other one
B	well that is
A	what the farm?
B	yeah
A	oh cos when we went
B	oh it's oh yes
A	and then grandma was very upset yes that's right you could see the wallpaper in the bedroom and she remembered it
B	that's right that's right
A	so where was that? was that
B	that was over there that's right
A	ah so that's gone now yes but
B	yeah they
A	at
B	yeah
A	ah right
B	yeah
A	mm
B	did you go there then?
A	you took us there yes
A	with my mum
B	why how old were you then?
A	yeah about seven or eight but I remember
B	oh I was gonna say you remember that then?
A	yes
B	oh
A	I remember grandma was very upset
A	she didn't know of course
B	oh that was that was the problem yes she got very upset when she saw these people knocking the walls down when
A	yeah I think she told them off didn't she?
B	yeah
A	yes
B	and then move on I think otherwise she was gonna get cross
A	yes
A	yes
B	brick by brick sort of thing
A	that's right
B	course she had a nice yard there not as big as the one we've got in the
A	yeah oh right oh that's good
B	and so and and a little erm
A	oh right ah that's pretty good
A	mm
B	so it was a big garden as well we put the pigs down the bottom
A	yeah
B	and and so
A	yeah it was nice mm
A	oh that's good
B	and so
A	yeah
B	have you?
A	yeah don't see them very often do you?
B	no not greengages
A	it's very old fashioned
B	yeah
A	you don't even see them for sale in the supermarkets
B	yeah
A	pretty much never see them for sale
B	oh
A	it's just coming into leaf now
B	where where it's has it always been there or
A	no they put it in
B	yeah yeah
A	but it's not an edible fruit
B	no no
A	erm but anyway when I got there there was no tree so I wrote them an email and said where's my tree?
A	and it wasn't the cherry it was the greengage
B	oh
A	but I was happier about the greengage cos that's actually quite nice to have a
B	oh it's lovely
A	do you like greengages?
B	yeah I
A	oh do you?
A	you can't eat too many greengages can you? cos they give you a real stomach upset if you do
B	I can't
A	you can only have one or two
B	I don't normally have trouble
A	yes well greengages I think are particularly sharp compared to plums
B	oh yes I remember
A	mm
B	plums yeah I
A	yeah when they're in season they're fantastic
B	have I got a plum? yeah I might have one there now
A	don't know might have one
B	yes I buy them when I see them
A	yes
B	they're gone in no time
A	very short yeah
A	yeah
B	yes
A	you'll get maybe two sorts
B	yeah
A	but actually if you go round the British countryside there's all different sorts loads and loads
B	yeah
A	like when I was in Cambridgeshire they used to have these little orange ones about that size and they were called Mirabel's they used to just grow wild in the hedges
B	oh
B	yeah
A	but just yeah a different type
B	I I'd forgotten you were at Cambridge yes yeah
A	yeah just for a couple of years
B	yeah
A	it is nice yeah I lived on the boat there
B	oh of course you did now I remember that bit yeah I thought you did
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	that was lovely
B	yeah that's right
A	I loved those two years on the boat
B	you you actually moved them occasionally
A	mm yes
B	but er you had to anchor somewhere else though did you?
A	on the edge of Cambridge
B	Cambridge yeah
A	so they were moored
B	was it a place er beginning with an
A	yeah
B	yes what was it called?
B	oh yeah that's right something like that
A	yes
B	yeah
A	it's very old round there
B	yeah
A	it's interesting there's a real sense of history round there
B	well Cambridge well it's it's
A	mm
B	it's er well it's not as big as Oxford but of course going to Oxford it's a big place but
A	yes
B	oh yeah oh
A	and once you go out of Cambridge it's incredibly rural
B	oh I know yeah
A	there's really nothing there
A	you would have trained round there wouldn't you?
A	you would have trained round there
B	oh yeah
A	on the planes
B	and I think I've got the name of the village there
B	oh they're still there are they?
A	mm yes
A	and there's pill boxes all the way along the the Cam still there
B	oh
A	yeah
B	oh
B	let alone fly an airplane
A	mm
B	well he swore at me
A	oh dear
A	that was the end of that
B	he he said you take over from me and
B	and he swore at me
B	and he swore what did he say
B	it began with a B
B	yeah
B	but I know
B	and they put down
A	yeah ah that's a useful life skill
B	er
A	navigation
A	yeah
B	oh yeah but er yeah
A	it can't be easy out on the fens though because it must it's all flat isn't it?
B	yes
A	it's all very similar and there's no real towns to navigate off
B	no there seems to be a problem
A	yes
B	because there's no way that
A	no
B	no
A	no
B	we we used to find that
A	yeah and then there's little rivers everywhere so that's no help you know
B	well in Cambridge
A	yes on the punt you used to go didn't you?
B	oh punts that's right
A	probably to what was it called?
B	yeah we used to take those punts out and
B	oh
A	was it
B	I don't know I've forgotten what they called it on the
A	yeah
B	if you're not careful
A	the pole stays in and so do you
A	yes
B	oh
A	it's good fun yes
B	oh yeah that's good
A	it's alright going downstream it's going upstream
B	yes
A	then it gets harder work
B	well I know one well one of my colleagues I remember at the time
A	ah that's nice
B	and and they used to cover us cos they
A	yeah
B	managed to get from A to B
A	yeah
B	without being spotted and that sort of thing
A	yes
B	so they filled in all
A	oh that was nice
B	we'd
A	yes
B	oh yeah oh no
A	did you stay in touch with anyone after the war?
B	no not much
A	no
B	cos I seem to remember
A	ah yes
B	and erm
A	ah right
B	I mean we had other people later on but
A	yes
B	not the ones I
A	not the ones yes and they're the ones you probably connected with the most
A	yes ah right
B	but then then that's probably
A	you weren't on the front line
B	all busted up no I was all busted up in the
A	yes
A	with how did you break it?
B	I'm afraid I've forgotten how I did break it now
A	yes
B	cos it
A	ah right
B	I
A	ah yeah
B	and then they couldn't er and so that's
A	oh right
B	cos it wouldn't wouldn't heal or something
A	ah
B	so now it's
A	no no
B	used to have a big scar down there
A	it's interesting that the body is amazing
B	yeah
A	cos that could be there twenty years and then it just disappears
B	yeah I
A	I think it's remarkable
B	you can't even see where it
A	no
B	I mean you used to see it to for a few years
A	yes
B	like a line where it had been stitched together you've got
A	it's amazing thought isn't it the body?
B	and
A	no you can't
B	yeah
A	no not at all
B	no
A	amazing really
B	though
A	yes I can see it's slightly swollen yes yeah
B	not that it makes any difference
A	no
B	I'm right handed so it doesn't make any difference
A	ah yes
B	no no
A	yeah
B	no no
A	interesting
B	I liked Cambridge when we were there
A	it was lovely yeah I liked it
A	oh did she?
B	yeah
A	ah yes cos you were in
B	just
A	yeah
B	got some photographs of that place somewhere
A	yeah so I've been to
B	oh
A	that's where the psychology department is
B	oh
A	and I used to go over there and take part in experiments for them get paid
B	oh that's nice
A	I used to go there quite a bit
B	well I was down in down south
A	yes oh she used to go to those
B	and not
A	yeah
B	is it
A	yes
B	another one like that used to go round
A	so was that for your training? you had
B	training yeah
A	ah yes it's interesting yeah
B	and then one time of course it I mean
A	oh
B	so we'd be going through Cambridge
A	yeah
A	wouldn't want to be somewhere bigger
B	but I've always liked Cambridge
A	yeah I like it a lot
B	I went to Oxford
A	no I'm the same
B	no it's too big
A	no
B	yeah
A	and Cambridge really is a small town
B	that's right
A	even these days you know it's grown
B	yeah
A	but it you're only a few miles and you're out
B	well I always watch the boat race and I always shout for Cambridge when
A	ah
B	did you ever watch it?
A	I
B	oh I always watch it
A	yeah
A	yes no it was a lovely place
B	I never used to take
A	yes
B	yeah
A	and you've gone punting as well have you?
B	I've been yeah I've been a couple of times
A	yeah
B	cos you need need to get stuck on the end of the pole if
A	that's right yes quite muddy on the bottom
B	well I know you
A	yes
B	oh no that's right
A	yeah
B	and of course
A	yes
A	yes
B	yes well I think in my day
A	mm
A	ah right
B	so
A	mm yes
B	and and it started first of all in Cambridge like that
A	ah
A	yeah
B	but no but I always had a
A	yeah me too I like it a lot yeah
B	yeah
A	no
B	yeah
A	cos I visited both and I thought oh I'd like to go and study in Cambridge for a year so that's what I did
B	oh yeah
A	yes
B	if you look at
A	I I've been to Oxford yeah I went and saw it and thought
B	not for you
A	not convinced yes
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A was in Oxford.	Entailment
B	yeah
A	no I just went to see it
B	oh to see it yeah
A	yeah
B	on all those canals
A	yeah took
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A hasn't been a student in Cambridge yet.	Contradiction
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A hasn't been a student in Cambridge yet.	Contradiction
B	yeah oh
A	and loads of locks you wouldn't believe how many locks there are
B	well Birmingham's full of locks isn't it?
A	yeah so it's a huge amount going into Oxford about ten miles out was about fifteen locks in a row
B	yeah
A	it takes a whole day to get through they're like a staircase
B	well when
A	mm
B	erm
[ANNOTATION]	There are no locks in Oxford.	Contradiction
A	ah
B	yeah
A	mm
B	er
A	yes
B	they took with it
A	not horse drawn they got eh er car engines actually they
B	they were yeah
A	yes
B	yes well in my day most of them were pulled by horses
A	yeah
B	and you used to find one man with
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	The car engines had a complicated mechanism.	Neutral
B	a young chap would guide the boat
A	ah right yeah
B	yeah pulling it along yeah
[ANNOTATION]	There is no guide in the boat.	Contradiction
A	yeah something
B	well I'll show you
A	mm
B	I don't think she was too impressed
A	yeah
B	what they used to do
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Someone didn't have much of positive thoughts.	Entailment
B	medieval times I suppose
A	that's right well it's funny though
B	are they?
A	the canals
B	that's right
A	it's not very fast
[ANNOTATION]	It is slow.	Entailment
B	yeah
A	but it is very cheap still
B	yeah yeah
A	cos you don't you know once they're moving
B	yeah
A	it's
B	well they used to say
A	ah
B	because of the pottery
A	ah right
B	so you fill up your boats you know
A	yeah
B	with you know cups and saucers or whatever you're putting on there
A	yes
B	and there used to be a lot going out
[ANNOTATION]	The boats were empty.	Contradiction
A	yes and things like coal as well
B	coal's always heavy
A	so it's very useful whereas I mean imagine doing that on trucks
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Coal is a good thing.	Neutral
A	it would be horrendous wouldn't it? so you could only really do that on the railways or the canals still
B	yeah
A	so it'll be quite interesting if that became commercial again
B	it well it would be yes
A	yeah
B	so lots of canals
A	we've still got a lot haven't we?
B	yeah lots of canals
A	yes
B	well occasionally they do some
A	that's right and there's still restoration going on
B	yes they're still doing
A	yeah in Wales they they're restoring some of them
B	oh
A	and they restored the Bude one but not all the way
[ANNOTATION]	The canals in Wales are in need of restoring.	Contradiction
B	no
A	the Bude one was never very long and it never connected up to anything
[ANNOTATION]	The Bude is a good canal.	Contradiction
B	oh yeah
A	it just goes from the sea inland about nine miles
B	oh right
A	but they've dredged that one out and you can
A	yeah
B	and
A	yes and it's still the law in the UK
B	no
[ANNOTATION]	It should be the law.	Neutral
A	Cambridge
B	is it? oh
A	that's the only place
B	oh
A	cos they've built on both sides right down you know the greens of the colleges
B	well the the
A	and there is no public right of way but that's the only place
B	but they they don't use them too much though do they now?
A	no but it's still
B	oh
A	the laws still there
B	oh the law
A	so you can't
B	yeah
A	so I mean it's wonderful for cyclists and walkers cos that means every single canal in the country is public land you can walk down one side will be public land
B	oh well
A	so you can go for miles and it's easy isn't it? I mean it's
B	well
A	navigation zero you just follow it
B	yeah yeah
A	yes
B	cos very often there's not two not two pathways
A	no it's one side that's the law there has to be
B	yeah
A	one side
B	oh I thought
A	yes but that's from the horses that they would of
B	yeah
A	had to of had those
A	yes
B	yeah on those canals
A	yeah
B	course we used to live very close to canals
A	ah right
B	oh the boats yeah
A	cos it
B	yeah
A	this was about ten years ago but it was over
B	ooh that's a lot of money
A	but if you rented a boat
B	oh
A	well you didn't have to share with anybody for a start
B	yeah
A	so at least the space was yours
B	yeah
A	and you can keep it as clean as you want to keep it
B	oh
A	so half the price
B	oh
A	private
B	a nicer way of living too
A	and a nicer way of living but it seems
B	yeah
A	a lot of people have worked that out
B	yeah
A	and apparently they're being overrun
B	oh
A	mooring up
B	cook your own meals on the boat then?
A	yeah I had erm
B	oh yes
A	just off those canisters
A	which we kept outside
B	yes
A	and er a gas fridge
B	yeah
A	so it was just gas
B	mm
A	and gas is very efficient
A	yeah
A	erm canisters
B	yeah
A	I mean in a year I didn't get through those
B	oh that's pretty good then yeah
A	yeah yeah it's pretty cheap and then
B	yes oh
A	yeah
B	you enjoyed your
A	I really enjoyed it
B	oh well
A	yeah it's a nice way to live
B	you live another day then
A	yes
B	er it's quite nice on
A	yes
B	er have I taken a narrowboat out?
A	mm
B	but er
A	yeah
B	I really I don't
A	oh that's nice
B	along one of the canals anyhow
A	mm
B	do
A	hm
A	yeah
B	oh
A	oh that's nice
B	cos he was he used to
A	ah
B	he gave me a set free once
A	oh that's nice
B	but I never used them cos I
A	no
B	oh
A	but
B	you don't catch a fish all day and they seem quite happy with that
A	no
B	and they used to take their meals and sit down at the side and eat their lunches and their suppers and
A	I have a feeling it was to get away from the wife more than the
A	the enjoyment of fishing
B	yeah
A	I think there was an ulterior motive
B	yeah
A	or get away from the noisy children
B	yeah
A	I think that is more likely
B	just
A	little bit yes not very well I do remember her though
B	yeah she has a
A	yes
B	and he he used to love fishing he used to
A	that's right yes they bought a caravan there didn't they?
B	yeah and then they had house sale
A	yes
B	and erm and of course the erm
A	ah right
A	yeah
B	can you remember her?
A	yes
B	she's
A	I expect so yes they were good friends actually weren't they?
A	I think they meet up once a year still
B	oh do they?
A	no
A	no
B	no no
A	ah
B	for some reason I don't know why but she
A	no
B	she didn't take to her very well
A	no
B	oh well so
A	yeah yeah it's good
B	cos
A	oh yes yes
B	yeah
A	they meet up once a year
B	same age oh she has another girl she's in touch with
A	does she? I don't know
B	who who was erm
A	oh yes
B	there's
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	there's someone else yes I know who you mean
B	there's one er there's one in Australia I think is there?
A	yes there's one in Australia she's Opus Dei
B	yeah
A	that's the Opus Dei one
B	I
A	might be both of them I don't know
B	yeah
A	not sure
B	your mum
A	she was wasn't she?
B	she doesn't go into church any more
A	yeah no she doesn't no it's interesting
B	oh no
A	quite sad what's happened to the church really
A	sad what's happened cos the churches are empty
B	oh yes yeah
A	you know just half a dozen
B	well your mum's the most
A	yes
B	course your dad still goes doesn't he?
A	yes
B	well
A	he goes a lot
B	well
A	yes
B	the way he was brought up I suppose
A	that's right they just
B	not really no
A	and society has
B	yeah
A	so
B	I suppose I
A	you go occasionally do you?
B	about twice a year or something
A	ah right
A	Christmas and Easter
B	probably er
A	weddings and funerals
B	well
A	yes the one in
B	yeah
A	yes yeah I know that one
B	yeah
A	yeah that's a nice one actually it's a nice
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	it's a nice
A	ah right
B	who used to call to the house
A	ah
A	oh dear
B	she just didn't like him
A	I expect it's changed now has he?
A	it's a different one now
B	I can see why I mean I got on with him reasonably okay but I mean he was used to talking to people like
A	yeah
B	and mum wasn't used to talking to people she didn't really know
A	yes
B	so that was the problem
A	yes that's right
B	and and
A	yeah
B	and have a chat
A	oh right
A	yeah
A	yes ah
B	so he
B	I'd heard he's not very welcoming
A	oh dear
B	I suppose she
A	yes
B	I think that was some
A	some of them are a bit out of touch I think aren't they?
B	I think so I think
A	yeah they mean well probably but
A	just have a funny manner about them
B	what was his name?
A	yeah
B	I was gonna say
A	is it someone different now though?
B	erm I've never seen him come round but I know
A	no
B	well
A	no
B	but then he is a chatter
A	oh right okay
B	he he gives himself a
A	yes
A	good that's good
B	and shakes hands with most people
A	yes
B	oh
A	the Catholic priests are fine you know they go round and they visit people as they should but the parishioners are not encouraged
B	no
A	but the other churches are much better like the Baptist church and the Salvation Army they're much more involved
B	I think they must be a little bit better off now than they used to be
A	mm
B	not as I go to them
A	ah that's good
B	you know because they've got the
A	yes well that seems sensible I mean it seems silly all having our own church doesn't it really?
B	yeah
A	I mean it's all the same god so
B	yeah we hope it is
A	yes so it seems a bit
A	so why do we need different churches?
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	it seems madness
B	well of course I suppose religions died away a lot now
A	yes
B	well I mean when
A	yes
B	they make them go to confessions or whatever it was they don't have it any more do they?
A	no no it's not a big thing
B	no well it used to be a big thing in er my day there
A	yes
B	what did we I think it was my brother I suppose
A	I know that seems madness doesn't it?
B	it's
A	yeah absolutely ridiculous
B	oh I
A	and talking about sin to a child of that age like well what would they know about that?
A	it's not them you've got to worry about
B	they'll get burnt at the stake sort of thing
A	yes no it was it was out-dated wasn't it? that was
B	yes
A	yes it wasn't even logical and the thing was it doesn't come from the bible
B	no
A	so that's just something people have made up
B	yeah
A	yes
B	yeah
A	I was an altar girl
B	were you?
A	mm before they were allowed
B	oh
A	the priest got in trouble for that he used to have lots of altar girls
B	well they do we've got them we've got we do have altar girls now
A	yes yeah at the time it wasn't allowed
B	no no
A	he just said well I don't care
A	mm
B	all dressed in their gowns too
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	and he was quite progressive
B	yeah
A	people used to go
B	yes well I
A	mm
B	not that I see him very much
A	yes yeah I did
A	yeah it was a nice church
B	oh well we used to take
A	yeah
B	yeah yeah
A	and you would have taken me there
B	oh did I? oh probably I did
A	yeah
B	well we when we were in
A	no when you were down here
B	it was down here?
A	when I was oh I suppose I was quite young wasn't I?
B	yeah
A	about nine or ten probably
B	ah yeah
A	and you used to take us to church then
B	oh I remember picking you up on the station there
A	that's right yeah I remember that
A	ah
B	with a bag behind her dragging it along the floor like
A	yeah
B	wait for me wait for me she was calling out
A	yeah
A	I expect I was excited
B	yeah yes you yes she was
A	yes
B	thought she was gonna get left behind I think
A	yeah
A	I used to be worried about those doors on the train
B	yeah yeah
A	cos they're you have to put
B	now they're
A	yes cos
B	yeah
A	well some of them you still have some of the old rolling stock though in use
B	oh do they?
A	they're terribly difficult for a child
B	oh impossible
A	cos you have to push the window down and you have to stick your head right outside
B	yeah
A	open it and then of course you almost tumble out er
B	well one
A	mm
B	so
A	I know very dangerous yeah
A	and if you didn't do it you get left behind so
A	yes I used to worry about those doors
B	yeah yeah
A	ah yes that's
B	did you see it on the board?
A	next weekend yes but I can't go cos I'm going to dad's birthday
B	oh of course oh yes
A	yeah so we can't go
B	oh
A	yeah we went on that once didn't we? together
B	yeah I think
A	yes well it must have been your birthday yeah

A	had the crumble going and I knew what time that would finish but then I put the fish in
B	yeah
A	and that was supposed to be twelve minutes and I had the potatoes on
B	oh
A	and that's twenty-five minutes and we had the beans on which are four minutes
B	yeah
A	so I needed the fish to be timed properly
B	oh
A	cos if you get that wrong then
A	it's quite a mathematical challenge
B	yeah
A	I think that you know that cos I had to think well that goes in first the
A	well the crumble went in first because that was half an hour but I mean at least that evened the time

B	yes
A	like chicken thighs or chicken drumsticks whatever you like
