A	yes
C	what
A	so you you work in
C	I do work in the
A	okay that's really cool
C	mm
A	have you always worked in
C	always yes
C	very long standing
A	right okay that's interesting
C	my two of my colleagues have been in
A	right
A	right
C	and erm
A	wow that is a lot of combined service that's great
C	mm
A	yeah I think it's like in comparison to a lot of teams we're quite a new team really I think
C	yeah
A	longest serving I've only been here four and a half oh
C	mm
A	erm
C	yeah
A	so it must be nice to have people who can kind of
C	know what's happened
A	exactly
C	yeah
A	it's like when
C	mm
A	we had that you know she mentioned to me oh yes I remember five years ago this thing happened ten years ago this thing happened and
C	we sometimes get textual queries and you spend a long time working out a sensible answer because they expect us to have a particular level of expertise
A	yes
C	and then it might come up again seven years later so you do actually go back to it
A	ah okay yeah
C	cos it's the same answer
A	that's
C	yeah
C	sometimes I do I'm the
A	oh right brilliant
C	do marketing so producing catalogues and leaflets and organising exhibition attendance and social media and web pages
A	brilliant
C	and a few other things
A	pretty cool
C	answering complicated textural queries
A	yeah
C	yes erm today I've been working on trying to sort out some business phrase books accounts
A	mm
C	doing some
A	brilliant yeah I've often like thought about the marketing
C	mm
A	sort of you'd obviously you do need to promote new new products and I find it really interesting it's not a new book but you need to find ways new ways of getting people interested in
C	yes it's it's different ways
C	yes there's different leads for example
A	absolutely
C	I've you know been writing something about our giant print edition
A	oh yeah of course
C	we do giant print library and we're about to do it in the the
A	mm mm
C	in eight volumes
A	oh very nice
C	so that's for people who are visually impaired
A	yes yeah so
C	well people with visual impairments I think is the correct term
A	right
C	oh really?
A	ah so I give them the catalogue and
C	yeah
A	it's it's the first time I've really thought about kind of buying one in that way you know
C	yeah
C	do you know what they chose?
A	erm oh what was it? it was one of the ones with the very soft leather was it
A	might have been good you know
C	oh
A	really soft and like
C	top of the range then
A	my dad wanted a really nice one
C	mm
A	not like an everyday thing in your
C	does he read does he read it regularly?
A	yeah and he wants something that you could yeah read regularly but also be really nice to keep I think and
C	that's good yeah
A	he'd been given you know some money as a present
C	yeah you'll get your fifty percent stuff
A	exactly
C	yes
C	oh I'm glad her found one that he likes
A	yes so he was very impressed
C	couldn't sell more of our
A	oh right that's interesting
C	we seem to be more willing to spend a lot of money on a quality product
A	yeah yeah I wonder if people here are more in the kind of just something in every day just to carry round with you and not not worry too much about the actual book and more you know whether there's a difference between sort of
C	it's odd because people
A	yeah but how how many people
C	might spend a hundred pounds on a pair of trainers
A	exactly yeah
C	a handbag
A	yeah and the
C	yeah
A	and
C	that's true
A	and
C	if you have something that's too expensive and you don't like to use it too much in case you
A	yeah exactly yeah
C	forget it I'm like that with jewellery if I've got very expensive earrings
A	yeah you can
C	I never wear them because I'm I use them all the time
A	yeah
C	yeah things are meant to be used
A	exactly yeah but
C	and the Bible should stand up to being heavily used
A	yeah yeah
C	so I think you should be able to
A	yeah exactly
C	a little bit rough with it
C	yeah mm
A	no that's
C	mm
A	brilliant so erm yeah what what are your plans for the weekend?
C	the weekend?
C	erm
A	oh okay

A	oh brilliant
C	outside
A	right what what time is that on?
C	ten thirty
A	okay cool
C	yeah the
A	yeah
C	send a message to the government although it sounds as if the government is at last doing something
A	yeah finally
C	yeah
A	yeah no
C	seem to have every national newspaper in to tell them
A	yeah
C	and they want to be acting
A	yeah I've been kind of following on Twitter how people are feeling about this
C	oh have you?
A	it it's interesting it
C	yeah
A	does seem to be
C	I think it's touched a cord
A	it has yeah
C	but David Cameron is the Prime Minister and ought to be leading public opinion really
A	yeah
C	rather than following
A	yeah exactly yeah
C	you know we're doing sections as well and the refugee action network which we set up two weeks ago
A	right
C	and
A	wow
C	you know collecting clothes
C	taking them out yeah to get the best to provide somewhere
A	yeah
C	yes we did it before for the
A	yeah
C	a few years ago
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	I'm sure I've seen that before
C	yeah that's right so I I need to ask somebody
A	yeah
C	well that's the main need
A	mm
C	is clothes men's clothes particularly
A	okay right
C	and in the smaller sizes because they don't have a problem they don't tend to have so many extra extra large refugees so
C	one problem they don't have
A	yes yes
C	so yes so and also books
A	right yeah
C	and I might might see if there's any old picture
A	yeah
C	cos they would be used to it
A	yeah so like English language
C	or foreign language books
A	but yeah
C	send a letter out we're doing a letter out to employers next week but erm we've been busy doing the rally and

A	erm cake seems to be one that it comes out quite well
A	so I get the chance to say that a lot at the press office
D	mm
C	is cake one of the most popular words at the press? she was saying that you'd tell us the
A	yeah
C	the word that was used most
A	it was
D	is it?
A	one of the most popular words in the
D	tea cake

A	yes yeah I work with
D	ah
A	on the language research team so collecting and
D	it's sounds so it sounds very cool and very exciting
A	yeah it is really cool I I was worried that it was just me getting enthusiastic but it's a really interesting kind of
A	mm
D	so yeah it sounds very cool
A	it's interesting it it's nice to kind of it's obviously
D	mm mm
A	it's got lots of interesting links to
D	mm
A	academia and
C	oh yes
A	and I think
D	really cool
C	do you have to try and get a balance from different sorts of educational background and ages and
A	yes yes that's one of the reasons we do these these forms is just to make sure that we're not only collecting people from
C	mm
A	potentially to other people as well
C	yeah so
A	yeah
C	do you try do you try to target particular groups if you're short of people in a certain
A	yeah
A	the first stage is obviously just getting people making some recordings starting out and then looking at what you've got and saying well we're low on these areas erm we're really interested in people from Wales at the minute
C	oh yeah?
A	not many Welsh people have
C	mm right okay
A	so if you know any Welsh people
C	my best my best friend's Welsh but she doesn't live in
A	ah well if erm people kind of living

D	oh yeah
A	I know
D	I know I'm

D	yeah
D	that was pretty grim
A	oh so it's over well done congratulations

A	so are you working here now or are you on
D	yeah
A	that's good
D	in the
A	mm
D	er
A	mm ah that's really exciting
D	yeah
A	so it's in you haven't been
D	yeah that's right yeah
D	no three days and this is my fourth day
A	oh amazing
A	oh welcome
D	yeah thank you very much yeah everyone's just super super friendly so far so
A	yeah
D	yes
A	and have you been kind of just getting used to things or have you been give
D	yeah I've been doing some training and
A	mm
D	you know getting used to they're kind of easing me in quite slowly so I'm not too
A	that's nice
D	yeah so it's been it's been really nice
A	yeah
D	yeah
A	yeah I'm trying to stay away from the bigger ones and just just relax
D	what is your erm background in?
A	erm so I did a degree in English literature erm
D	okay
A	and then basically thought I'm kind of interested in publishing generally so I'll look for a job in publishing and see see what I make of it
D	yeah
A	see if
D	okay
A	and just fell in love with it just really really loved the job and
D	mm mm
A	the kind of research that we do and
D	yeah sending these
A	and I just stuck with it really
D	yeah
A	erm
D	mm
A	it hadn't really occurred to me and
D	really great
D	very lucky
A	yeah I'm so lucky
D	to find something you like
A	yeah I mean the plan was definitely to just try something out for a year and see how it went and
A	I think that kind of happens like my colleague
D	mm
A	let's find a languagey job and
D	kind of see
A	just see how it goes yeah
D	I did my undergrad in er English lit as well
A	mm
D	yeah it's really hard
A	I think I was so jealous of like engineers who
D	I know they just kind of
A	yeah
D	know what to do and
D	they go and like
A	mm
D	I mean yeah it seems like there's more of a straightforward path whereas English literature is pretty much you can what's the word translate across like many different
A	mm
D	except for if it's technical or
A	yeah yeah it's transferrable skills rather than anything very vocational
A	yeah I think this job's quite nice cos it is kind of related a bit to languages but
D	to language yeah of course
A	yeah
D	mm mm
A	reading what other people had written whereas this is completely the opposite approach
D	yeah
A	just really like datary evidency
D	mm
A	erm
D	did you do any
A	nothing
D	I tried I tried to kind of do like a broader spectrum like I didn't just study English lit erm I did like professional writing
A	right
D	wanted to see like which area English I was most interested in but then I couldn't decide
A	yeah
A	that's really nice like I went to the traditional university
D	mm mm
A	very very traditional ideas about how you study literature and
A	it was great it was really good and like
D	yeah
A	you know it I learnt a lot but it there was no concept of like using a computer to support your study of literature
D	right
A	it's like books erm
D	yeah
A	and no one
D	right
A	did you go to
D	Canada
A	Canada ah okay
D	yeah in
A	yeah sounds like it was a much kind of
D	yeah it was very wide
D	you could choose you know I did English literature and erm like British English and then American like new age literature and
A	oh right
D	then like yeah philosophy courses in literature so like studying
A	that's really cool
D	Aristotle and things like that and then new stuff like graphic novels and kind of like a big mix of whatever you wanna I think I did one in Irish plays as well which was quite fun
A	yeah
D	they were like very very violent from the seventies I remember
A	oh right
D	it was such an excellent course
D	but yeah I tried to
A	yeah
D	just take a huge variety of
A	yeah
D	not to get bored anyway
A	that's great yeah I mean mine
D	mm right
A	and there was a module on erm sort of postcolonial studies and various other things
D	yeah
A	but it was pretty much your traditional kind of
D	right
A	England from seven hundred to now
A	erm but mainly English to like eighteen hundred erm
D	right
A	and you know it was it was good it was interesting but it was kind of quite quite narrow I think
D	yeah
A	so it's it's nice now to just to read stuff
D	for fun
A	for fun and I read loads of graphic novels now it's
D	I love them that was the best course I ever did
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker D did not like the course.	Contradiction
A	I'm so jealous
D	yeah it was really amazing
A	I'm like I'm still getting into them
D	yeah have you read
A	I haven't read
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker D did not read any of them.	Contradiction
D	you have to it's the best one
A	yeah is it? okay
D	the best one I ever read for sure
D	hands down absolutely
A	it looks really serious is it quite difficult?
D	it's serious yeah it's not it's not a
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	It is not serious.	Contradiction
D	but it's really easy to read I think if it's split up into two separate books
A	mm
D	and each each one is I mean you can sit down and read one whole book in maybe a weekend
A	yeah
D	cos you just get so into it
A	yeah
D	mm
A	I'll give that a go I think my favourite so far's been Scott Pilgrim which is completely the opposite of that
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A liked Scott Pilgrim.	Entailment
D	I haven't I didn't read that one actually
A	oh Scott Pilgrim is so good
D	mm
A	it's really it it it's really funny really silly
D	my flatmate has it on the bookshelf I'll I'll sit down
A	I recommend it so much
D	yeah he does too
A	erm and he's got another one called Seconds erm
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A didn't like Seconds.	Contradiction
D	okay
A	which is really good erm it's like these
D	mm mm
A	erm but it's erm about a woman who opened a restaurant erm
D	oh that sounds cool
A	mm which is a really interesting idea
D	mm
A	and obviously it all kind of starts
D	mm
A	doesn't quite go as smoothly as but er yeah I recommend that as well
A	mm all
D	I should head back I
A	yeah sure
