A	no
B	mm
B	mm
C	could I have another one of those? or
B	yeah you can help yourself
C	mm?
B	yeah
C	sure?
B	yeah there was this Germany girl as well which we
C	mm
B	she's didn't realise she was expecting a baby and she came down the next morning and she said
B	she got she got erm
C	oh
B	and do we know the number of a hospital? so we looked it all up
C	what was she doing miles away from home?
A	walking
B	well she was only six months but
C	oh I see oh so
B	mm
C	mm
B	was with her cousin wasn't she?
A	mm
C	oh so she wasn't on her own then?
A	no she wasn't on her own
C	mm
A	but she was the driver
C	oh
B	mm
A	yeah
B	which made it a bit difficult
A	it did didn't it?
B	and then we managed to get her an appointment
C	mm
B	we said don't go to hospital cos it's miles and miles away
A	yeah
C	mm
B	er and the doctor then in
B	no
C	what?
B	there were they were only open for a couple of hours a day and that's only for four days a week
C	mm
B	that was absolutely useless
C	mm
B	er
C	mm
B	and then and the next place was
C	mm
B	the
C	mm
B	health centre
A	yeah
C	mm
A	at
A	that's what it was called
B	that's right
B	mm and I managed to get her an appointment immediately which is good
C	mm mm
A	crying
C	mm
A	we just hope she's alright
B	mm
C	mm
A	we don't know
A	mm
B	yeah
B	what else did we have that was difficult? can't remember now
B	no not really did we?
A	no
A	yeah
B	mm
A	mm
B	it was full up though
C	look the sun's coming out now it's nice it's not it's not
B	yeah
A	mm
B	are you getting worried about his age now?
C	I was worried about it a long time ago till I realised that
B	mm
C	or I thought
A	yeah
C	cos if I couldn't phone them now and say oh I got it wrong
A	mm
C	well I need to make a claim now for what I've paid
B	mm
A	mm
B	mm
C	and they were laughing in there
B	so you've got the money already?
C	no I haven't need to get it
B	mm
C	erm
C	you know these wooden planks going round the ditches?
A	yeah yeah
C	I was stood on one and I whistled him and he tried to get past me and his left foot went and he went straight upside down in the ditch
B	oh
C	and all the brambles and the
B	oh dear
C	and then he he
B	mm
C	I think that's how his eye went funny
C	but that must've been a big effort for him just you know
B	yeah
A	mm
C	so that may have popped a muscle or a they think it's a nerve in the end that's that's broken
B	mm
C	cos the nerve controls that
A	mm
B	mm
C	he doesn't he can't do it it's it's there's a nerve that
A	yeah
B	no
C	that does the inner eyelid so it's still over his eye but he's not bothered he's not he's not
A	mm
B	no mm
B	I've got
C	mm right mm
A	hopefully
B	mm
C	mm
A	yeah
C	mm
A	mm
C	put it on both sides there was a lot of trouble last year with people being in there with no badge er and we saw one lot er a big lot ten you know
B	yeah?
C	young farmers one of them collected up all their badges went out and he came in with another load of people keep using the badges to get people in now if you can't leave without a badge or they've
B	what what are we talking about?
C	well the members' badges at the
B	right
C	they're for one person who you know if you're up to the age of thirty you pay your age
A	mm
C	so if you're thirty you pay your age over thirty it's forty-five pounds for adults
B	oh I see
C	so say you're eighteen and er consider yourself an adult you pay eighteen pounds
A	mm
C	which actually is quite
B	so if you're twenty-nine you pay twenty-nine pounds?
C	clever way isn't it? see? erm but then an adult is forty-five pound
A	mm
C	and the family is
B	but there will be lots of people saying they're only twenty-eight twenty-nine
A	mm
C	the place is licensed for a certain number and the certain number is controlled by the number of badges
B	right
A	mm
C	so we can't go over the number so for the licensing laws of alcohol
A	well when they leave
A	why don't you stamp the hand?
C	alright he hasn't he hasn't got a badge you stamp his hand now he can get in and out without a badge
A	no he's gotta have his badge on when he come back in but if you've stamped his hand you know he's gone out
C	no
A	yeah
C	they're asking because people will collect collect them up and go and fetch other people in you see?
B	right
C	so that and I realised what had been going on and this might've been going on at
B	mm
A	yeah
C	so they wear them underneath but we still need to see them
B	right
C	when they're in they need to have them visible
B	but you can hand your badge onto someone else can't you?
C	if you if you're not in there yes
B	mm
C	if you're staying out fine it doesn't you can but it's just controlling the numbers
B	mm
C	that doesn't matter but everybody in there has got to be
B	right
C	and I'm now gonna make a sign that says the no badge naughty pen and put it on a fence
B	mm
C	oh but er little Johnny doesn't need a badge well he looks over five to me can he please go and get one
B	mm right sounds a bit complicated
C	it isn't it isn't really there's just young adult adult couple family and a vice president which pays a hundred and five pounds
B	mm
C	just cos they wanna seem posh erm and so that that's it but a child starts at five
B	yeah
C	but you know they say oh but he doesn't need one he's a child yeah well he look he looks over five to me
B	yeah
C	erm
B	yeah but I mean all all the
C	no I don't know
B	bit weird isn't it?
C	well they want the thing is there's no
B	I think children should be a children price and
C	well when when do you stop being? what they've done is because you know they want to attract more young farmers cos when when we
A	yeah that sounds well
C	and you're trying to get youngsters in
B	yeah
C	interested and by doing that when they're eighteen they're only paying eighteen pounds which is a bargain to get into the facilities that are there
A	yeah
B	right
C	you see?
B	right
C	erm
B	yeah
C	they if they wanna walk around with young adult badge which is different or an adult badge
A	yeah
C	or just a members' badge there's a separate different colour for the young adults
A	mm
C	so they erm and actually if
A	yeah
C	obviously they won't you you've gotta walk around with a young adult badge with with a different colour
A	mm
C	and then they
A	yeah
A	you know you may not want to when you're at
B	mm
C	I dunno
B	yeah
C	it's interesting but there's er it's there's an awful lot to it there's
B	but you get you
C	mm
B	it doesn't say
C	no it just says young adult it doesn't say what
B	I paid more than eighteen pound
C	no
B	mm yeah mm
C	but
B	mm
C	I didn't er used to like showing the bus pass and things like that that shows you're old
B	but when you're just thirteen and and you
C	mm
B	no longer used to be
C	mm
B	thirteen cut off
C	mm mm
B	you did you ever say you were still thirteen?
A	only getting on the bus
B	getting on the bus yeah I think I did
C	mm
A	did it all the time for a little while did it all the time
B	mm
A	even when I was sixteen they didn't know
B	no
A	I was such a baby face
B	yeah when I when I took the girls out
C	mm
B	for a
A	yeah
B	we went to castle
C	mm mm
B	don't know if you've ever been there anyway we went and and and
A	mm
C	right so
B	and I had to say I did say
A	mm
C	mm
B	cos I it didn't seem right
C	mm
B	that she she would quite happy to think we were all
C	mm
B	which is a great compliment of the day
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	B has been to a castle at least once in their life.	Entailment
C	mm mm it is isn't it granny?
B	I wasn't granny then
B	oh but
C	yeah
A	mm
C	the
B	mm
C	they had another barrier round
A	mm
C	people handing it over the hedge
B	yeah
C	they got somebody else to come
B	I don't know how you you stop that really
C	well I had to and I think I'll make a little I'm gonna make some little
[ANNOTATION]	They were alone because nobody came.	Contradiction
A	mm
C	you know or just hold it up you know
B	mm
C	otherwise we'll be in trouble I'll put something like that please
B	you're taking it on yourself to do this?
C	I am
B	oh are you?
C	I that's my responsibility is the whole of the members whatever the food the bar
A	is it?
C	that's the trouble and
[ANNOTATION]	It is not their responsibility.	Contradiction
B	oh
B	mm
C	that people don't walk around not supposed to walk around with alcohol one year
B	mm
C	we got we thought why are all these people walking round drinking juice? looked like juice cartons you know
[ANNOTATION]	They seemed to be drinking juice.	Entailment
A	mm
C	but how do you stop people
B	mm
C	wanted to license the whole showground for drinking alcohol er you couldn't run a show
A	no you couldn't
[ANNOTATION]	C did not want to license anybody.	Contradiction
A	insurance is dear enough anyway ain't it?
C	oh yeah last year they didn't make a profit because we had a hopeless Saturday
A	mm
C	we had a humdinger Sunday
B	yeah you did
C	but it it it more or less broke even you know there was there was a small profit
A	mm
C	someone got run over
C	there there were floods
A	the
C	so yeah so yeah yeah yeah
C	so we we we did well
B	yeah
C	mm
C	mm
B	mm
C	so we have the same guy on the gate all the time he puts the same guy up the far end for me so they know what they're doing they turn up
B	yeah
C	mm
B	mm
C	and I think the easiest way is to do a little thing
A	mm
B	yeah
C	mm
B	mm
C	mm through the hedge
C	mm
A	they just dug a hole underneath the wire netting
C	mm
A	we did us kids
B	did you?
A	yeah
C	oh oh all the rebel kids used to do that as well but they've they've what they've what they've done is
A	no we couldn't walk in it was you had to
C	mm
A	there was ways of getting in
C	they've got ten-foot palisade fencing
A	mm
A	yeah
A	mm
C	erm
B	we used to
A	you could get in the
C	mm
A	very easily
C	mm
A	but the
B	was it free after four o'clock on Thursday or something?
A	yeah yeah
B	used to be I don't
B	but they were all packing up
A	yeah you can get sausages and stuff couldn't you?
C	mm
C	but you've still gotta park
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	parking costs you
A	no they don't
C	it's owned by the farmers and if they're not growing crops they need to make the money that they would have
B	mm
C	if they were growing the crops
B	yeah
C	that's why whatever they would make for a crop they need to make for the car parking
A	that's
A	yeah
B	a pretty good income
C	oh yeah
A	yeah but they don't make any money er when they get back to crops
C	mm mm
A	cos
A	they put
C	mm
B	mm
C	but I don't know
B	yeah
A	and also the car park
A	no
C	but they are all there they have all the prize
C	yeah
A	each day
C	yeah
A	a hundred thousand pounds is a lot of money
A	I tell you every year
C	you can't er you can't even you can't even watch the stuff because people buy their seats
B	mm
C	you know pay for a seat
A	oh yeah that's
B	yeah
C	er that's that's that's ridiculous and you get events happening and no one's sitting in the seats
A	yeah
C	fine you know and then there's plenty of space right the way round that everybody else can
B	mm
A	you even have to pay to go into the flower show in the

A	yeah
B	yeah yeah
C	erm erm and it's there's a whole there is a whole day's worth of entertainment for kids in there once they're in
B	yeah
C	whereas you go to any other place you pay for each bit
B	mm
C	it's astonishing what? what? three pound a go on a bouncy castle? and if you've got three kids? ah
B	mm
C	that's what
B	are they?
A	yeah
