A	yeah my erm my like great grandma and like when she was younger then obviously my great great grandma and everyone who I've never met my dad told me like they all used to smoke cos everyone thought it was like good for you didn't they back then? so like they all like smoked like chain smokers and then televisions came out and like so they used to save up to afford one
C	oh yeah?
A	so they stopped smoking cos like obviously it's quite expensive isn't it?
C	yeah yeah
A	so and then they saved up for a telly they got a telly so they could watch the queen's coronation or whatever and then they never smoked again
C	mm
A	just cos they like they obviously must've like felt better or something
C	yeah yeah probably yeah yeah
D	it must've
C	you just said TV but
A	I think it must've been the first colour telly
C	yeah yeah
A	that makes sense doesn't it? yeah the queen's coronation was probably the first thing
C	I don't I don't
A	I think it must yeah it must
A	the queen's coronation was the first thing that was on colour TV
C	it is yeah
A	I wish like I don't know cos like okay yeah there's lots of advances in technology now but nothing that
C	yeah I guess I mean I guess there's big things for people who regard them as big
A	yeah
C	do you know what I mean? but I guess it's little things for us
A	yeah just thought oh yeah you've managed to make something
C	yeah
C	yeah
A	like but I can't get over that telly that we saw in Costco
B	it's a 4K curve TV yeah
unknown_female	yeah
A	and I just couldn't like get over how crystal clear it was
A	it was
B	they were showing a play
A	yeah like a theatre production wasn't it?
B	theatre er
C	oh really?
A	and I was just like I feel like I'm in the theatre watching it
B	you'd see like
D	wow
B	every every thing every little imperfection on people's faces as they were singing
C	oh my god
D	yeah
D	that's so cool
A	I was just like I'd never like cos when I've been all oh cos he always puts things on HD don't you?
B	oh you've got to yeah
A	I'm just like I can't see the difference at all
A	it was like there's no point
C	you need a
D	again
B	oh yeah that that
C	yeah yeah
A	and I'm just like
B	but that was like
A	there's no difference
C	no I don't think there is
B	have you ever seen a 3D football game?
A	I and then when I saw that telly I was like okay now I can see
C	yeah yeah
A	the difference between that and and I was like four grand that could buy me a nice car
B	yeah
E	yeah
B	yeah
B	and I was saying I think it it was
E	oh okay
B	yeah it was probably like three years ago
E	I think that's when I I first saw it
B	yeah
E	saw it yeah yeah
B	yeah
E	I saw a erm a four yard screamer
B	yeah
B	yeah
B	yeah?
B	oh yeah
B	yeah
E	but it's not become so widespread
B	3D it was
E	yeah
B	yeah
E	but it it's good for certain things other things it's like I can't be arsed with the glasses
B	yeah
E	once you can get round the glasses thing
B	that about I was about to say that yeah yeah
E	yeah
E	really?
B	yeah so that's another
E	oh yeah yeah
B	well there's that as well yeah
B	they say it came out before its time I think so many drawbacks like it's like an alpha don't think there's a like not even beta like
B	yeah without yeah yeah
E	no
B	yeah
E	yeah
B	I think as well a lot of people
E	yeah
B	you're not interested in buying a
E	have you seen Star Wars yet? no?
B	no
B	I
E	have you seen the other
B	as a kid yeah
E	as a kid?
B	yeah
E	well watch them again
B	well that's what I was thinking actually I'll watch them again
E	cos the this one'll probably have more significance well you'll still understand it if you
B	yeah
E	but it'll add a lot more to it though
E	yeah it it it's it's not a waste of time
B	no yeah yeah
D	yeah
C	I'd never pay that money for it
A	no
C	right
C	I found my little TV in my room
A	it does the job don't it?
C	all my laptop's
C	which is so bad my phone is better quality than my laptop screen
C	I'll turn it I'll turn it off like I'll've been watching Youtube and then I'll watch some Youtube on my phone and I'll up end up like
C	it's so nice
D	high quality
C	yeah that's quite good yeah
D	imagine like not like we've grown up with like phones and computers like like no one did before us it's really weird
C	yeah
D	and we are the first generation
A	they they say now that two-year-olds know how to
C	oh
A	and obviously there's something like even my mum is a bit averse to
C	my
A	and er yeah
C	my mum's
A	my friend's erm niece like nephew can't remember which
C	yeah
A	went to like my friend's mum grandma saying grandma why why why does your phone have all these buttons?
C	oh yeah
A	because obviously they've been brought up with
C	yeah touchscreens yeah yeah
A	and they're just like why does your phone have buttons grandma?
C	oh
A	I was like that's so cute
C	oh
C	yeah
A	and I distinctly remember going
C	oh
A	oh right oh no I was at like cos it was quite it was like year six years five and six brand new computers we we just had it built for us
C	oh I thought it was like yes
A	and it was you know
C	yeah
A	like
C	I know yeah
A	and then erm I was just like cos that was touchscreen like with the pens
C	yeah
A	also I I remember distinctly remember saying like wouldn't it be so much easier if you just like touch that screen rather than with the mouse find where the mouse is?
C	yeah
A	you know when you lose your mouse sometimes? and then like after that how much easier would it be to just go?
C	yeah yeah
A	type
C	yeah yeah
C	yeah
C	when you think about it like it was nineteen eighties when the first mobile phone was invented
A	yeah
C	so it's just it was just our generation when it became like accessible to everyone
D	I know like
C	yeah you know what I mean?
D	so we're not sure how it's gonna like affect us like
C	yeah
C	yeah
A	and there's microwaves coming from phones
C	right yeah
A	and they say like the more like you talk on the phone like it spins the
C	yeah
A	spins water molecules in you brain and it was like I remember doing this in science
C	yeah
A	said like
C	pretty mental
A	and that's why they say men shouldn't have it in their pockets cos every time it gets
A	exactly and then it can they think they think that's one of the causes so men need handbags
D	I
A	yeah you need Joey's man bag
D	I can't imagine like what I can't imagine
C	post?
D	well yeah or like
A	you you sort of have to know like when you've
D	I'll meet you on Wednesday at like two PM
C	yeah
D	ha ha ha
A	at the bus stop
A	can't ring you can they?
D	it
A	it'd be much easier to get away with something
D	yeah
A	cos I remember like
C	oh
A	because whenever like I went out playing with like
C	yeah
A	and my mum would like say right you've gotta be home for sunset
C	thank you
A	and it wasn't even
A	thank you
D	thank you
unknown_female	it's alright
A	it wasn't even like no she you had to get home before it was dark and then just as the sun was like getting a little bit low not even sunset just a little bit low she'd ring me go
C	yeah
A	but I and she
A	and she says like no don't use that excuse I'm like no no I do not want to walk the dog whilst it's dark
D	my mum don't like me walking home from the pub on my own it's like two minutes from my house
C	oh
A	and just yeah and I think that's why
C	yeah
A	don't like it because she was
C	mm
A	bless
C	oh
A	so I think that's what happened
A	a behaviourist psychologist would think so so
C	oh
C	I used to lie to my mum though she doesn't like me walking home in the in the dark
C	I'm like I'll get a lift someone someone'll
C	I'm just like
D	yes they
C	I'll be fine
E	I'll take you back
C	no
C	you know she'd be like who you with?
C	don't do that
A	see my brothers they they say like they don't worry about me because I'm taller than most average men
A	so they probably wouldn't even try I'm like
E	from from a distance they might think oh
A	so yeah they but
C	oh yeah
A	then they said
C	well what is
C	what do you reckon?
A	oh yeah what do you reckon he'd do? fight or flight?
C	flight or fight? what would you do
A	I reckon you would fly I reckon you would run
A	you'd you'd throw one punch and then run
A	I I think
A	he wouldn't do anything he'd just sit there and like
C	he'd cry
E	fuck off I'd run
A	no he'd
C	he would yeah
C	he was legging it in Slovakia and there was no one even there
C	he was like there's some dodgy people coming up
E	no there was there was that one there was that one guy
C	no you you were too busy like
A	like one guy against two people
C	one guy not not doing anything
E	I was like come on then
C	not doing anything and then and before I even turned around telling them that nothing's gonna happen he was legging it and I was like
C	bye then I'm not running
A	you
C	no no he didn't he didn't even say come on don't lie
C	he was too busy like oh I'm gonna get killed here
C	ran away
E	but if that was a real situation I went come on and you didn't come on then
C	a real situation
E	yeah
C	it was fine don't he clearly wasn't gonna do anything and you were just like
E	clearly yeah
C	it was it was a pretty little place as well
C	don't pretend you know what happened cos you were drunk
A	what's that?
B	a Ginsters
A	a what?
E	a Ginsters
C	in a fight or flight situation
C	I'm a flight

B	if I was a few pints down I would've
A	yeah if if he was a few pints down you would fight but
E	yeah definitely yeah
B	I yeah I'm a bit of a fighter
A	not a
E	and also you're not a runner so you're not gonna get far
B	we sprinted across Sainsbury's car park
B	and I won
E	yeah
B	over like twenty-five metres
E	I was gonna say if it was if any more than that
E	see you later
C	oh I beat
A	yeah but you you seem to you seem to think that you can outrun me
B	if the if the distance was right yeah
A	if the distance was right
E	like Gimley
C	yeah yeah
A	I reckon I could sprint for longer than you
E	yeah probably
E	well if it was
E	it's like it's like a lot of a lot of race
C	bring it down to something that we understand here we go
B	if it if if it was a
A	quarter of a mile?
E	not in like in car in car terms
A	oh car terms
E	I I have I have a car that would win that
E	but you you well you would be the car that had the greatest top speed
E	if you had more acceleration
B	so so so over a mile
E	yeah
B	you'd you'd be there first
A	shall we do it?
A	run
B	I
A	on on
A	no I don't mean right now
C	okay they're heavy
C	I've got boots on they're heavy
B	I
C	yeah
B	no my boots are heavy
C	no yeah to be fair I've got
E	when I was racing with you I thought I was gonna fall over for most of it so
B	yeah I know it wasn't nice was it?
E	it wasn't
C	ah
E	I kept thinking I'm dead
A	why were you running across Sainsbury's car park?
E	we were pissed and we were like we were cold as well though
B	just got running and
A	just got running
B	er
E	it weren't home we were

A	town oh yeah on in
D	he's maybe run the length of campus before to get to a bus on time

D	er yeah but I'm like gasping
E	like if  you didn't reach that you'd be like
A	I'd have to take my inhaler first

D	I would I wouldn't blame you
A	I reckon if we like get on the treadmill at
B	fuck doing that treadmills

A	I reckon if we put in nought point two miles
B	as if that interests me at all
A	and like just ran it as fast as we could
B	on the screen?
A	that'd be good
B	okay
A	got longer legs
A	what it's all about?
B	yeah yeah
A	although with long legs I don't think I'd outrun
B	yeah
E	he kept complaining
