D	but I said first
C	well look two birthday people can go first if they want okay?
G	well no well well it's it's it's erm
C	it's
D	well you're not
unknown_female	what is it dad? or
G	yes but we can play them later
unknown_female	dad what is it?
C	I'm just reading rules here right I'm just
unknown_female	dad?
G	cos he's he's he's already seen them
C	just ignoring stuff that I don't want
unknown_female	dad what is yegg?
C	we haven't said what yegg is just pick the top one because otherwise you'll be reading the next one
unknown_female	what was the yegg one?
D	yeah what was what was yegg?
C	a yegg was actually a burglar
D	on no a yegg's approaching
C	it was a burglar
G	a yegg
C	or a safe breaker
H	oh
G	really?
C	yes not a large Tibetan mountain goat
unknown_female	well that would just be a mountain goat
C	okay so first of all tell us what word you have
unknown_female	yeah but it's a type of mountain goat
G	shh shh shh
C	okay I'll
G	listen to your dad
unknown_female	rakehell er
C	spell it
unknown_female	it
C	spell it
unknown_female	it's rakehell basically
C	what? spell it
unknown_female	R
unknown_female	K E H E
unknown_female	L L it's rakehell
unknown_female	but I
G	rakehell? that's
G	that'll
C	R E? R E or R A?
D	well no one else knows how it's
D	actually pronounced
G	they're all very very erm erudite words that we've never heard of so
unknown_female	yes
G	so you don't know the
E	yeah
C	oh you're supposed to
D	can I see?
C	oh wait wait no actually the game is more complicated than this anyway but
C	carry on carry on
G	can we just do the simple rules first of all?
E	yeah
G	but er
G	mm
D	why's there like so much
G	oh no wait
C	oh no this this ah this makes much more sense
G	oh right
C	this makes much more sense
G	but what is?
D	so it's not truth or lie?
C	so
C	you're you actually you form into two teams right?
G	oh two teams? right
C	just like
D	okay
C	and for each card you pick there's there's like the right definition and two wrong ones so what so well they say if you were a team of three
G	right
C	one person does the true one one person does the two wrong ones and you have to
G	ah right that's
D	ah
G	ah that's
C	and if you've more than three the others could just make up complete definitions
D	oh
D	I think it should be like this and then like that
G	you alright darling?
D	so four people on each team?
G	mm
G	what are you doing?
D	all three people
C	oh and there's two things you have to do right?
C	so you've got to first of all guess which of the so let's say if there were three of you and you said one of the three things er when you've got er four you've gotta guess which one is true right?
H	yeah
C	that's the first thing you've gotta do then the next thing you've gotta do is you've gotta guess which one was the one that was made up not on the card
G	shall I pass it up to you pet?
C	so the card is one right one and two wrong ones but if there's more than three of you although what you should do is
D	can you just make one up anyway?
C	yeah so if there's only three of you you can use the right one one of the wrong ones from the card and one made up
D	yeah who's going the wrong one first?
C	so
unknown_female	then we'll know
G	oh no well it's erm
D	oh
C	you could do the double bluff
G	well
C	but she has to show it
unknown_female	quadruple quadruple bluff
H	yeah
G	mm
D	oh oh my god
C	okay well you should sit there with
D	oh
C	in between
G	I'll sit here
C	you should you should sit next to him cos you'll have to see the same card
C	unless that chair is a better chair?
G	no no
unknown_female	mm
D	oh
C	you have a card? so you should consult with your team there and decide without letting anyone hear which is gonna do the false or the wrong one and
H	okay just a minute
G	and don't read them out at all
H	no no yeah yeah
C	and when you've finished playing
C	help tidy up the table okay?
unknown_female	can we get a card?

C	and don't be trying to sneak a
G	E H E L L rakehell
unknown_female	how many erm?
G	and don't don't read those out
H	no
D	who else is in
C	one does shh one does the truth one can pick one of the wrong ones and one can make one up
D	yeah
unknown_female	I know
C	so you can skip one of the wrong ones
C	no because then you can't guess who made one up
unknown_female	yeah
G	yeah I'll tell you which one to read
H	yeah
G	okay which one are you choosing
C	just point you don't have to tell say you do the right one you do that

G	scientifically
I	actually
I	benzene is a
unknown_female	it's benzoin
unknown_female	it's benzoin
I	compound
I	which is
G	oh right it's an it is oh right
I	it's actually
G	so it could be it could be it could be hers then
I	so it's probably something like that but I know those typically come from oil and plants so it's definitely not yours then
G	no cos she's er well but his is a
D	you're mean
G	plant you see
I	uhu
G	it's a plant
D	how do you know it's not me?

unknown_female	where are the
unknown_female	utter hogwash
G	I actually I know quite a lot of those actually
D	a second I was checking how it works
G	what's written on the back is not what is on the picture
D	playing the game when everyone is ready the dealer turns over the top card from the deck
unknown_female	a spider wearing a bobble hat
G	want to put it erm to
D	er
G	erm to put it down?
D	okay
G	right the spider
unknown_female	wearing a bobble hat
G	wearing a bobble hat
D	somewhere among all the pictures on the table is the one that matches the answer there are no turns as soon as the player sees the matching picture they must call out the answer again and then pick up the matching card
G	so then what you're supposed to do is put them all face downwards right?
D	I don't know if it's I think it's just all the black ones
G	oh right yes put all the black ones
D	I think it is
G	I think you're right erm so just put all the black ones
D	how do you
G	and then
unknown_female	no I think this is face down
D	yeah that's face that's face like oh that's face
unknown_female	yeah it's cos we need to be able to see the pictures
G	I thought I thought it was that you
unknown_female	some of
G	it was turned like that and somebody picked and answered
unknown_female	oh yeah
G	ah that is the spider
G	right?
unknown_female	oh I dunno
G	er or you can just all dive in
unknown_female	yeah
G	and erm
G	but that's that's very easy you see
unknown_female	but when you're laying yeah when you're laying them out like that
G	mm
unknown_female	it kind of like it looks a bit insane
G	mm
G	if they're all if they're all face down
D	hang on a second
G	this is too easy
D	yeah but then the pictures are not what they seem
unknown_female	mm
G	I know so you're looking for a spider
D	well it's not that
unknown_female	what's a bobble hat?
G	a bobble hat is one of these little
unknown_female	it's a hat with a bobble on it
G	little hats that you
D	a spider wearing a bobble hat mm
G	well
unknown_female	are you sure it's not on one of the white ones?
unknown_female	yeah I'd say this is probably the
unknown_female	that actual
unknown_female	the actual things and then that is where the
G	those are the actual things?
unknown_female	yeah so how about we play with that deck?
G	so it oh oh
unknown_female	what so
unknown_female	yeah try and do the first one like that

G	erm
D	or we could reverse it
unknown_female	I already got the first one a boxer knitting a sock
unknown_female	it's say the white definitions cover the black cards
unknown_female	yeah
unknown_female	would make more sense
unknown_female	this is this one
G	no no it it actually
D	oh
G	doesn't work that way but put it down
D	I so
G	and then right
D	instead of reversing all of this and that I could just put one of these out
G	but put them all out put them all out
D	no but that's no mm
G	mm
D	granny
G	mm
D	the game is
I	yeah
D	for that one
I	cos they'd say you have
D	and
I	one deck out and then
D	yeah
