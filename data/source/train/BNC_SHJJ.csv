B	mahjong pieces
A	mm mm
B	oh
A	yeah
B	so I should really do my
A	but you can get good deals from different places
B	no but I'll do research online I think
A	yeah
B	really?
A	and they're a bit you know?
B	oh good
A	yeah
B	oh
A	yeah
B	I
A	but you have to pay for the phone?
B	no well yeah yeah
A	mm so if you get a contract they'll give you a phone?
B	but I've already got my phone
A	right
B	that was years ago
A	that Nokia one?
B	yeah
A	mm
B	well cos
B	I
A	oh yeah yeah so so like with these things you can yeah
B	and I can't do it on Nokia yeah you can do that you got the language already built in haven't you?
A	yeah
B	yeah yeah
A	mm
B	that would type Chinese it typed it
A	right
B	so it only works with certain phones
A	okay
B	email and everything
B	yeah
A	if I get anything in Chinese you can just press translate and
B	oh right
A	bing it's done
B	do you use WeChat then?
A	mm
B	who with?
A	with the Chinese woman
B	oh which one?
B	oh the one you met there?
A	erm
A	yeah
B	did you hear from her recently then?
A	yeah we were talking
B	is that the one who was phoned up drunk or?
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	so
A	I don't know I didn't I didn't follow it up
B	oh no
A	like Monday Tuesday
B	there's this random person wants to practise their English?
A	I don't know
B	mm
A	you know it's it was quite interesting
B	yeah they have the?
A	mm
B	rural lunar calendar
A	yeah
B	like it's it's I think it's the same as the Muslim calendar so
A	right
B	Ramadan
A	okay
B	it's based on the moon
A	well so she said cos seventeenth of March is her birthday
A	okay
B	so she does sort of communicate
A	yeah no no
B	just random
A	quite
B	questions in English or something
A	but that
B	texts
A	yeah
B	and she uses Chinese sometimes? with WeChat
A	some yeah yeah
B	wow
A	so I don't know if it's to practise her English or just to have a
B	or
B	you have to get to know them you have to
A	that's just like
B	it's like hello I want to be your friend
A	mm it's
B	yes it's so charming that's all
A	she never really asked questions
B	yeah
A	so like you were saying ask random questions it's me normally that asks the questions
B	mm
A	she would just sort of write hi
B	mm
A	you know? she would so often do things like that
B	yeah
B	yeah yeah
A	I'm walking
B	almost like autistic
B	yeah
B	it's true
A	and you say you know
B	yeah
A	that's her hobby
B	no you have to ask question after question
B	you'd ask a question
B	and by the way there's a nice mountain in this province if you wanna go walking
A	no
B	you have to ask question after
A	yeah
B	I found that really bizarre
A	and that kind of thing and it's and you're having a conversation you're like well
B	do you like walking? yes
B	so where do you go? I go there? where is there?
B	yeah what's the weather like there?
B	yes
A	yeah
B	it's bizarre
A	so that's what I mean it's quite
B	and that's what you have to teach
A	ah
B	you'd have to teach a lot of pragmatics
A	alright okay
B	that's what I realised too late
A	aha
B	and it and if I had gone in knowing that
A	right yeah it's
B	gonna be wrong
A	I suppose you're prepared for that
B	no
A	you know you've got
B	and you can only realise after the event
A	right yeah
B	absolutely crucial and intercultural er you know conventions like yeah
A	yeah
B	cos I
A	it's funny yeah but they it that
B	different notions of common sense
A	right
B	different notions of yeah
A	like you were
B	volunteering information
A	yeah you know because teaching that's what teaching is isn't it? teaching grammar
B	mm
A	and then that's done you know that's pragmatics
B	it's intercultural teaching it's crucial
A	oh yeah sure
B	yeah
A	yes
B	yeah
A	you work that out yourself when you're there don't you kind of you're like oh yeah I'll do it
B	it's like my friend from China he knew things like oh
A	oh yeah yeah
B	people might only know the noun
A	yeah
B	treat but then you can use it as a verb I'll treat you it means I will pay for our meal
A	mm mm mm mm mm
B	I should've done I should've done that
A	because you probably
B	I just did these
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	and it was
A	because you're not because that's the problem you're not encouraged to think the
B	it no but yeah
A	yeah
B	and the techniques that I'd been taught
A	mm
B	and how can get that across?
A	mm
B	what can you do in the lesson?
A	yeah no for sure
B	some techniques
A	the lowest common denominator of of language
B	well
A	mm
B	and so new to teaching that
A	well you might find they might maybe wanna do those
B	but then it puts doubts in your head doesn't it? you think makes you think I'm not a natural teacher or
A	I don't suppose there is anything
B	no
A	there might be someone who's
B	that's true
A	yeah
B	it is an art
A	and I thought no don't I don't know
B	no
A	not at all
B	oh of course yeah anything you want
A	oh
B	course you are
B	it's not a North Korean corpus of English
A	really? talking of Koreans apparently two Korean Korean Koreans have been given the death penalty in China
B	really?
A	for smuggling drugs
B	yeah
A	mm
B	there's the sad story of that Ugandan man
A	uhu
B	erm
A	right
B	not the legal system here
A	right
B	and
A	mm
B	there
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	and it's not valued as much as a Western life you know and it's happened a few times
A	but then there was that British guy wasn't there?
B	yeah
A	British whatever he was British when he probably needed to be British but
B	no it has happened to a few foreigners
A	yeah
B	and that that's why it's
A	mm
B	everything's
A	but but where is it where
B	I don't know
A	oh yeah because of
B	yeah
A	that's
B	yeah
A	kind of
B	no they get it from
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	from India British India
A	from India
B	yeah
A	so it is just a
B	Burma
A	yeah
B	and erm
A	well yeah cos when I flew to Vietnam they mentioned that cos we flew to
B	yeah
A	we
B	yeah
A	so if you've got any flush them down the toilet now
B	oh yeah it's quite
A	no no no
B	it's erm
A	well yes again and and I suppose because we've got such a tolerant
B	but but even laws like in Thailand you can't criticise the king
A	yes yeah yeah
B	Swiss guy got drunk and
A	you're not allowed to do that here though are you?
B	well but you wouldn't be
A	no no
B	you wouldn't be jailed for it would you?
A	no
B	that's the difference
A	yeah
B	quite liberal but then
A	yeah
B	and erm
A	don't they have their own separate language or something for talking about the
B	I don't know
A	king someone was it
B	that's interesting
A	when we were talking about honorifics once
B	maybe you're right
A	cos there was er one of
B	are there lots in Korean?
A	yeah they're a bit weird about that you know like?
B	but is it less with the younger generation?
A	I don't know
B	yeah
A	you know? yeah yeah
B	but for them it would change I think
A	and I suppose they were being a little bit cheeky I suppose they would because they would've known that he was
B	no it's not that they know it's not the norm in the UK so they would
A	yeah
B	yeah it's funny that isn't it?
A	mind you that little one
B	woah but it's gets bizarre though cos in Chinese
A	Phyllis and Maude
B	there's one
A	uhu
B	and I said okay what do I call the other aunt?
A	oh
B	and it's the same
A	oh
B	it's the same word
A	yeah
B	what do I call a third auntie?
A	yeah
B	same word
A	so
B	so what do I call?
A	what do you do in the airport when you call out someone auntie and then a thousand people turn round
B	or just go oi you you know?
A	oi you
B	but
A	no
B	because they don't use names very much or they're not chatty with the older relatives I think
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	and it's the and it's the other one
A	ah
B	oh no
B	that's ridiculous
A	isn't it? yeah
B	but I think the younger generation no
A	but they do they do do
B	and they don't they no they they don't they don't initiate conversation with each other so much
A	you know? no
B	funny isn't it?
A	yeah cos I was watching
B	they still have this very hierarchical family system
A	yeah
B	really?
A	they don't
B	okay that's interesting
A	it's kind of
B	hierarchy
A	yeah then I then I was thinking back cos I don't really have a family and I was thinking back to when I was younger and thinking when I met my cousins and there is a bit like that you know there's the
B	yeah
A	and there's a kind of
B	yeah
A	and then there's you who's the kind of kids and you can speak to the next ones up slightly and there's all those
B	mm
A	I suppose I dunno what do British people do?
B	er
A	how to
A	oh
B	yeah
A	it's yeah
B	well maybe they don't and they don't meet people who are
A	yeah
B	it's a lot much more relaxed in English culture
A	when do you when do you when does it when do you? like some of my mum
B	yeah there is that
A	when you can call them by their first name? all your aunties like auntie
B	there is that
A	when do I say?
B	there's that funny Harry Enfield sketch isn't there where he goes er?
B	and the friend comes round to the house and he goes
A	and then?
A	yeah yeah yeah yeah
B	he's really polite to the
A	yeah
B	that does still exist in
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	I think
A	and when do you? when do you suddenly?
B	which is nice
A	when are you able then to sort of call them by their first name? as and then whereas perhaps in
B	well but
B	it's more relaxed I call my friend's dad
A	but
B	older
A	but but in Korea or China I don't if it's
B	yeah yeah
A	you're always older brother sir
B	it comes bizarre where
A	right
B	and she was very reluctant to tell me
A	yeah
B	weird isn't it?
A	what do you call them? you don't call them by their names though do you?
B	no I say
A	oh
B	father mother
A	uhu
B	but I didn't know those names
A	it is odd
[ANNOTATION]	she was unwilling to tell speaker B	Entailment
B	no
A	their names either do they?
B	names are such a fascinating thing
A	yeah
B	do
A	I remember one
B	I should've done the whole lesson on that
A	could've done
B	oh no
[ANNOTATION]	the names are very unusual	Neutral
A	one one lad I was teaching within erm
B	weird isn't it?
A	why do you wanna learn the students' names like like?
B	er
A	just to address them
B	yeah it's weird isn't it?
B	I did that in China I made I made a point of
A	he was
B	oh I hate that yeah
A	yeah you
B	and I had every students' picture
[ANNOTATION]	speaker B tried to remember students' names	Entailment
A	no on on a dartboard
B	I asked every student to bring me a passport photo
A	that is weird
B	and it's
A	get locked up for that over here
[ANNOTATION]	speaker B did not want to remember students' names	Contradiction
B	because the
B	no cos I had eight classes a week
A	gosh
B	no
A	yeah
B	at the end of the year you could do your job properly and know
A	uhu
[ANNOTATION]	speaker B remembered every student	Neutral
B	that's their name and
A	yeah yeah
B	you know what I mean? that's  I thought I was doing my job
A	to
B	and they they're they're
B	used to being inconsequential and anonymous
A	oh yes okay
[ANNOTATION]	speaker B believes a teacher should know the students' names	Entailment
B	their education
A	that explains why I had such a rigmarole getting the names out of them on the first day when I was teaching
B	pointing
A	and then they'd come out with all their bizarre English names like red and black and
B	yeah
B	had one called Satan
A	really?
A	huh
B	oh yeah
A	yeah
B	and their names below them
B	I think it's important cos how can you teach if you don't know
A	I think that's that's
B	people?
A	I I think so
B	well I I should've
B	well looking back I should've explained that
A	mm
B	we have class lists in the UK this is part of your education
A	yeah
B	your intercultural education
A	yeah yeah
B	British teacher and this is what we do
A	yeah
B	so that
A	yeah yeah
B	mm
A	for communication between them and whoever else or?
B	a purely functional language or pragmatic language?
A	yeah
B	cos
A	yeah
B	reading manuals or
A	right
B	but some of them would need pragmatic language if they're gonna be translators and
A	yeah
B	interpreters and
A	oh really?
B	translating for Chinese companies
B	to know about local Englishes and maybe the history of the local Englishes and
A	that's quite
B	what's different about the accent and the vocabulary
A	yeah yeah
B	so
A	yeah yeah
B	since China's been engaging more with Africa they need to know
A	right
B	other varieties of English
A	yes yes yes yeah
B	and I'd meet people at English Corners who were like
A	right
B	they would go on trips to Bangladesh so they would need to know about you know? they'd need to get used to the heavily accented
A	I met a Kenyan guy in
B	Indian English
A	problem is he's talked more standard English than
B	well this is it yeah yeah the
B	was he erm a teacher?
A	yeah yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	oh yeah?
A	very you know well spoken and like obviously very sort of
B	oh yeah
A	mm mm mm
[ANNOTATION]	Indian English accent is heavy	Entailment
B	I'm actually saying people
A	yeah yeah
B	actually native speakers that that group of people who are studying abroad you know?
A	probably got a higher level of English than a lot of undergraduates
B	which is why
A	mm
B	L one who has L one is it always people who
A	no no yeah
B	like someone who's never left their village
[ANNOTATION]	the Kenyan never left his village	Neutral
A	well
[ANNOTATION]	the teacher left his village	Neutral
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	really? I think old Blockhead talks about something
B	oh yeah yeah yeah
A	yeah
B	cos I've met a lot of Americans who who who get lost when they're
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	over here she she she found my accent quite difficult to
[ANNOTATION]	my accent is hard to understand for a woman	Entailment
B	yeah
A	my accent even me
B	she's from LA?
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	yeah
A	Korean
B	it's about exposure isn't it? that's what it's about
A	yeah yeah
B	cos
A	yeah
B	in American English so people
A	yeah yeah
[ANNOTATION]	exposure to an accent helps you understand it better	Entailment
B	get attuned to it don't they?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	just a bit more the code is a bit more
[ANNOTATION]	American accent sounds different than my accent	Entailment
