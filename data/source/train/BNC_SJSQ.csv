A	there we are so yeah what's happening there is happening on thatch roofs
C	oh right
A	that there are rooks pulling off all the straw off thatch roofs
C	oh dear
A	and erm
C	oh yeah
A	erm you carry on talking about that in there and I'll make coffee
B	yes I think it's some something to do with the weather and maybe the the bugs that they're looking for in the grass and have proliferated through the warm weather through the winter
C	yeah
B	perhaps you know
C	yeah
B	unfair really
C	I know
B	we've we've we've got it reasonably stable now I think that's the thing
C	yeah
B	cos you've finished the fencing I see all the fencing
C	oh yes yeah yeah
B	just paint the horizontals yet
C	yeah
B	but er and we've put a path down this side of the fence
C	right
B	so you can get into the far side of the borders without too much difficulty that makes it a bit different
C	yeah
B	so yeah it's it's reached a fairly stable situation I think
C	the grass looks pretty good as well doesn't it? I mean apart from there where the crow's doing that
B	yes we had a
A	yeah that's just so unfortunate
C	yeah
A	because we had a lot of moss and erm well between myself and
C	mm
A	and ruined the lawn however
C	mm mm
A	Alan Titchmarsh said that he'd done the same thing and he's never going to use that product again
C	oh yeah?
A	er yeah that I heard that subsequently
C	oh right
A	erm so erm
C	and what so what did do you do?
A	erm it was erm er er er you sprinkle it on it was a dry mix that you had to sprinkle on to the erm
C	yeah yeah
A	and then I thought it would just seep into the ground and the moss would die
C	yeah yeah
A	instead of that it burned the moss and made it black
C	yes yes
A	so you have ghastly black patches all over the lawn
C	yeah yeah
A	which you well obviously didn't really want so erm now I've er er now erm we got rid of those last year so that went the lawn grew back it looked wonderful and then
C	so so the grass did did grass grow back through it?
A	it grew back well we put no we no we put erm we put seed down
C	oh yes
A	because obviously we had to seed it didn't we
C	because I put the stuff down at er at at at the cottage in Cornwall
A	oh did you?
C	and it left black patches
A	yeah exactly the same thing
C	and and and you know and so it
A	you only have to rake it off seed it
C	yeah yeah
A	is that what you did?
C	well no I haven't done it yet
A	oh you haven't done it so you've got the black patches
C	I need to go
A	well don't ever do that again
C	I know no
A	Alan Titchmarsh says never do it again
C	yeah no no
A	erm
C	it's very very erm erm
A	yeah
C	I mean it's really erm very very good at doing that and the weeds
B	yeah
A	yes
B	yes
C	erm but the erm but yeah it's left some pretty bad patches so
B	yes no we had that but
C	yeah
A	shall we just go and shall we go and sit in the study?
B	yes
A	and then we can switch the computer off and everything erm and erm
C	yeah not bad at all you know it's it's I mean it's it's lovely travelling
A	exactly exactly well come and sit here
C	yeah
A	okay and erm
C	okay
A	yes erm now
C	we have ways
A	is that is that does that coffee look alright to you?
C	oh I'm sure it's fine
A	is that alright?
C	oh yeah yeah
B	do you want me to switch it off?
A	erm yeah hang on a sec I was just going to discuss something with you before you do we'll leave it there
B	oh right okay
A	can I just discuss this?
C	yeah of course
A	we're going to New York you see
C	oh yes yes yes
A	and and erm and er sorry for shouting at you
A	we're going to New York
C	yeah
A	and erm
C	oh lovely yeah
A	but they don't have any
C	oh right yeah
A	basically I've been through everything
C	well it it it's the sod's law whenever you wanna go somewhere it's gonna be when they haven't got it on
A	yeah got it on yeah exactly
B	yeah yes it's erm
C	mm mm the the only thing you can do is I found is the only way to do it in reverse is to is to go look for Gershwin concerts in New York or something
A	yeah yeah yes that's what I've just done yeah yeah
C	and go and look at it and then
A	well the only Gershwin concert's at Christmas
C	oh right
A	yeah there's a big Gershwin concert at Christmas
C	oh right yeah
A	erm whether that was last Christmas or next Christmas it doesn't really matter
C	mm
A	and then erm then I looked I I've just got to well I've just bypassed it erm but there's nothing it it's all it's not Gershwin we we want to listen to Gershwin
C	mm mm
B	I'll have a little look a moment
A	yeah you'll have to go back a screen I've gone to May the twelfth so if you go back a screen erm
C	mm
A	erm and erm
C	mm
A	if you go to the end yes there you are there we are number six so there we are that's Carnegie Hall in the middle that's New York
B	yeah we're not there until the second
A	mm no exactly there we are so
B	there's the first one then
A	yeah
B	Haydn and Brahms
A	I mean you can hear all that in England so why do you?
C	yeah exactly yeah yeah yeah
A	and and and you look at Broadway
C	mm
A	and they're all shows you can go to in Bristol so
C	yeah yeah
A	so why do you want to go to New York you know?
C	yeah I know it's it's er
A	it's crazy
C	yeah and often actually it's shows that are in London do do have a touring show
A	well they do
C	and so if you can go to Bristol or Plymouth or
A	mm
C	wherever you know and you think well why go to London you know you know yeah?
A	exactly why go to London?
C	mm
A	I tell you there is something good on at
C	oh right what is it?
A	and it's erm with Brydon the comedian and erm
C	oh yeah yeah yeah he's good
A	oh
C	er yes I know
A	erm it's called
C	he was he was being interviewed the other day
A	yeah on one
C	Brydon and erm
A	it it it's not a very erm notable name and it's but but the thing is it's called the
C	yeah
A	and he's very upset because his wife has left him for her psychiatrist and the bloke in the adjoining room is a professional erm murderer er a professional killer
A	and so they've turned it into a they've turned it into a comedy
C	oh yeah
A	I really want to go and see that that's on in London
C	oh yeah yeah that's good yeah
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	so erm
C	I'm trying to think who it is I saw them on TV they were on TV the other day
A	yeah they were very good erm
C	Brydon and
A	I've got I've actually got it written down somewhere I've actually got it written down somewhere cos I pulled it was in the paper in in the Daily Mail
C	yeah
A	don't tell me I've lost that
C	yeah yeah she had to go a day early actually erm
A	oh yeah
C	the the the
A	oh right
C	and
A	it's these ganglions ganglions?
C	no no the the it's something in the I don't know I don't know what the
A	yeah
C	but it's something in the bones or something
A	right
C	and I don't know it's it's if she didn't have it done it could cause real big problems later on I don't know
A	right sounds like ganglions
C	mm
A	that's not the word they used
C	mm no I I I I haven't she didn't I haven't asked her actually specifically what what it is it's just it's just quite complicated apparently
A	right
C	and so erm anyway her mother was looking after helping look after the children last week and she she by the end of the week she couldn't cope
A	right
C	so
A	crikey yeah
C	instead of you know er so she's up there a day earlier so erm erm so that's it she is up in
A	oh right? how old are they now?
C	they're erm they're one's coming to twelve and the other one's eight
A	right
C	so it it it's just really I mean it's not
A	well they should be quite easy to look after
C	they they should be
A	easier than below that age anyway
C	but
A	oh isn't she? is she quite big?
C	and er yeah
A	oh is she?
C	yes
A	that does cut one's mobility down I tell you
C	mm
A	I can bend over from the I can I'll show you
A	I can bend over from here right down
C	oh well done
A	and I can't well I mean I can do it I can do it anyway
C	yeah yeah
A	but there's absolutely nothing
C	that's brilliant
A	there
C	yeah yeah
A	there's absolutely nothing
C	that's great
A	it's weird I mean sometimes I do it and I think god you know? what's happened?
C	ah yeah
A	but I was never fat was I?
C	no no no you've always even quite quite slim
A	I'm a
C	eight and a half
A	I'm a whole stone underweight
C	oh wow
A	so erm I was well I was nine I was nine stone four basically before nine stone four and it fluctuated
C	yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	so I've not actually lost yeah nearly a stone in weight
C	yeah
A	but erm yeah I mean I'm not eating any sugar
C	yeah
A	I'm not eating erm any yeast erm all these things erm upset me you see
C	yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	so why have them?
C	well yeah exactly
A	and erm I don't want them anymore
C	no no no no
A	I have I I have been having eating a hundred percent chocolate from Peru and it's got no sugar in it at all and it's the most bitter thing you've ever tasted but I've actually got to like it out of desperation just to have that taste of chocolate you know?
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	I think they're seventy or eighty percent chocolate
A	and and the rest is sugar
C	is it? oh is it? oh I see
A	yeah so now a hundred percent it's got to be a hundred percent sometimes if I'm out and I'm really really desperate I do buy eighty-five percent
C	ah
A	so you can get and do you know where you can get them?
C	yeah
A	you can get it in erm it's er Fairtrade and you can get it in Oxfam
C	oh right?
A	mm
C	okay
A	mm and so erm I I did see my
C	mm
A	you know but
C	yeah yeah
A	if you don't have the sugar I go to the
C	mm
A	and I buy it in there and you can get three bars of a hundred percent Peru chocolate for erm I think it's nine pounds
C	really? yeah yeah
A	and you you have to buy them in threes to get a discount
C	yeah yeah yeah
A	and they all say to me how on earth do you eat it? and I say well the first time the first time I had it I was out shopping and I thought I could fancy a bit of chocolate and I just bought it and I'd never had it before
C	yeah
A	so I broke off quite a large piece I put it in my mouth
C	yeah so yeah
A	erm and er just dreadful and no sugar and you but if you have little bits of it
C	yeah
A	you get the taste of the chocolate and then you're looking for the sugar all the time in the chocolate and it's never gonna come you know it's not there
C	the chocolate it's it's got lots of is it
A	yeah yeah it's
C	yeah
A	in fact I've got a a a leaflet about it that erm she gave me
C	mm
B	well I think there's several possibilities there but
C	mm
B	it's getting the
C	mm
B	they all they all seem to have their blooming
A	the properties of chocolate
C	mm mm
A	it says erm dark chocolate is loaded with nutrients that can positively affect your health made from the seeds of the cocoa tree it's one of the best sources of antioxidants
C	mm
A	contains eleven grams of fibre sixty-seven of the
C	mm
A	well that's good isn't it?
C	yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	erm
C	but
A	well exactly
C	it all has a lot of er
A	pure yeah
C	nutrients and things
B	plant extracts sort of thing mm
C	and it's only the things that you know man made that are added
A	exactly
C	I I I presume
A	yes it is
B	mm
C	that actually are the things that you that you don't really want to have
A	well it's the
C	mm
A	because people in order to you know in order to eat that chocolate you've got to really need to eat it I mean you wouldn't eat it
C	mm
A	if you were of low er reserve of low spirit
C	mm
A	because it's so bitter
C	mm
A	and of course hundred grams three point five ounces is a fairly large amount and not something you should be consuming daily all these nutrients also come with six hundred calories and a moderate amount of sugar
C	oh
A	if you're having it seventy to eight-five percent
C	oh right okay
A	for this reason dark chocolate is best consumed in moderation I mean it is full of fat er cocoa fat
C	mm
A	the fatty acid profile of cocoa and dark chocolate is excellent the fats are mostly saturated and
B	mm
A	bottom line quality dark chocolate is rich in fibre iron
C	no that's very good
A	there's two pages of it
C	mm mm
A	I mean it well it is it it can improve several important
C	mm
A	erm and it improves blood flow and lowers blood pressure and of course it's an antioxidant
C	mm
A	erm what else has she put in here?
B	does it does it make the tea as well?
A	a take home message there is considerable evidence that cocoa can provide powerful health benefits being especially protective against cardiovascular disease but of course this doesn't mean that you should go out and consume lots of chocolate every day it is still loaded with calories and easy to over eat on maybe have a square or two after dinner and try and really savour them
A	I
C	mm mm mm
A	and to change some of my pills and erm and she gave me that but she I've been having a lot of dental problems and it's really amazing she also gave me a bottle of erm
C	mm mm mm
A	this is like an antidote
C	mm
A	it's a homeopathic antidote
C	mm
A	so I showed it I've been to the dentist this morning I showed it to my dentist this morning she said keep taking it she said
A	she's great like that
C	mm mm
A	I felt that she might have said gosh I might stock some of that for my patients
C	mm mm
A	but anyway I only had it because
C	mm
A	and she was in such pain she had three root canal fillings
C	mm
A	three nerves died in her teeth within
C	mm
A	about my age she's about my age
C	mm
A	and so she sourced this
C	mm mm mm
A	she said to me I told her you see what happened was she was filling this tooth and she stuck a needle into the tooth with erm the hydrogen peroxide that they use to kill the nerve
C	mm
A	unfortunately unbeknown to the dentist there was a hole at the end of the tooth
C	oh
A	and the hydrogen peroxide went through the tooth and right into the hard palette
C	oh
A	and so it essentially it burnt the inside of my hard palette
C	oh dear
A	and the pain was dreadful I was in the chair and I was anaesthetised and yet everything was going alright as far as it can go alright
C	mm mm
A	and suddenly I had this dreadful stabbing pain in the middle of my hard palette so I shot up and I said gosh have you put a needle in my hard palette she said no and then she looked at it on the on the er X they X-rayed it and she looked at it and what had happened was the the
C	mm
A	so the the fluid instead of going
C	oh god
A	no
C	er what was it? oh er a few few months ago I I I
A	yeah
C	you know and and and it's funny that you you have to sometimes
A	yeah
C	and then I can't remember what happened but oh I know a bit of
A	oh did it? yeah
C	so I went in and I said you know it's it still feels kind of funny in the and and she had a poke around and she oh and she had to remove a filling but underneath the filling it had got erm it had collapsed or something
A	oh really?
C	but she couldn't the the X-ray is not good enough really to spot that
A	right no yeah
C	er but nice she realised that she could then fill in and and it was fine you know it it was brilliant but erm erm
A	is she private or NHS?
C	NHS
A	is she? yeah
C	yeah
A	I go privately
C	yeah
A	I go privately because I've got a well my dentist has all my photography up in her you ought to go in there I've got a whole permanent exhibition in my dentist's
A	I've got all my photographs
C	mm
A	from my second year my BA honours degree that I'd got a distinction from they're all around her she chose them I she didn't pay for them but it's on permanent loan
A	so they do look good you've seen them haven't you? you've been in and seen them
B	yes you ought to have a card up saying that they're for sale
A	she has put a card up
B	has she?
A	yes she has
B	oh right
A	yeah she has she's put a card saying erm the
B	it wasn't when we last went in there but
A	yes there's been one there ever since I put them up
B	mm anyway
A	oh was it? well maybe it's fallen down or something but anyway I'll have to get her to put it up again but erm
C	mm
A	that you can't hope to sell it all
C	mm mm
A	but I have sold lots of things but not not that you were a bit big and they're not everybody's cup of tea but they're great for a
C	mm mm mm yeah yeah yeah
A	erm
B	well they look very good
A	erm yeah they do but erm I mean I I'm sort of I look at them sometimes and I think did I do that? did I? cos they're out of context you see
C	yeah
A	anyway there you go erm
C	are you still are you still are you still painting?
A	yeah I'm going I'm going to an art group on well I've got erm I'll show you I've got erm three photographs in for the photographic exhibition
C	mm
A	I think you may have seen that have you seen that?
C	I can't say I have actually that's very nice
A	I've got it's erm do you know where this is?
C	er
A	can you guess? cos it it couldn't really actually
C	no but it it's very effective
A	well remember when we went down to Wales for uncle
C	mm
A	and in the morning
C	mm
A	I took this photograph
C	mm
A	it was eleven o'clock in the morning and it was bright sunshine and that's how the camera took it and it looks like it's at night
C	mm
A	so I don't need to tell anybody that except for you which is quite interesting but that's how it took it
C	ah
A	and this is this is the water flowing from one side of the sand flat to the other and you can actually see the pattern
C	mm yeah yeah
A	on the sand so that's erm that's one
C	yeah yeah
A	erm and erm the other two you may have seen erm that's
C	I I think I've seen that one yeah
A	you've seen that one that's rust on a canon in
C	yeah yeah absolutely
A	that's going in the browser that's just erm
C	oh
A	and I did erm I did a close up picture of the paint
C	yeah yeah yeah
A	I mean it looks much better when it's not in plastic I'll just take that off a minute
C	yeah yeah yeah it's almost three dimensional
A	it is isn't it?
C	mm
A	people say oh that's erm and I'll show you what I bought recently we went to erm a really good flea market in
A	which is quite quite big erm and erm I'll put that back in a minute I'll show you what I bought just bring it in it's really funny
B	I was just looking at the erm
A	look at that
C	mm
A	now what I thought I'd do with this chair is I would erm
B	yeah
A	compress it and use it to as a stand
C	yeah
A	so that you can see a little black framed photograph with the ladder back chair
C	mm
A	on the chair
C	mm
A	so it would be a good way to show it at an exhibition wouldn't it?
C	oh absolutely yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	although obviously I didn't make the chair but the chair's cast iron
C	yeah yeah yeah
A	it's a really hefty thing yeah
C	yeah yeah
A	I think that's really nice and it was funny I was walking round with it and a couple of people said to me oh I was gonna buy that
A	so I obviously has good taste in that certain situation but those are the four that are going in the exhibition
C	mm
B	here you are look that's that's my straightforward sort of picture just
A	oh yeah
C	oh yes yes yes
B	just an ordinary picture and you can see that's the
C	yeah
B	yeah well
A	but that's still a very nice picture
C	very yes er
A	that's where we were that's Dylan Thomas' house
C	oh yes yes oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	we went in there as well we were the
B	yes it was it was the last it was the
A	yeah yes er we were the last visitors they were closing that morning and
B	there we are there's his erm
C	yes his erm I think I I've peaked here I can remember
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	I don't they're I don't I think Caitlin or Dylan Thomas did they did much tidying
A	I think their life was somewhat hectic what with erm Augustus John fighting with him over Caitlin and
C	yeah
B	that's the standard yeah yeah that's the sort of cliché
C	yes yes yes yes
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	was it?
C	when we were there so yes it was just about closed wasn't it?
B	got any other pictures we can show
A	mm
C	well I I saw erm
A	can I just
B	Anita Harris?
A	oh yes you can show oh yeah show show
C	oh right oh wow oh right
B	and that's her husband
C	I still remember her from the meal we had at
A	yeah well she she I don't think she oh what you can show
C	mm
A	and we take our car erm we they do do very good lunches there don't they?
B	it's in
C	mm
B	erm
A	oh yes a firework display at the Eiffel tower
C	oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	well we were at the Eiffel Tower and I I can't tell you you could hardly move it was shoulder to shoulder with everybody
C	yeah
A	it was the Bastille Day
C	oh the Bastille yeah yeah
A	and it was the Bastille Day celebrations and they virtually blew up the Eiffel Tower all evening
B	so
A	not not
B	and then it all changed to red white and blue and there were these sort of trials coming off them
C	oh right yeah
A	oh shall I pull the
B	and then it sort of got progressively
C	oh right
A	can you see that alright? oh that's alright
C	yeah it's not
B	more and more dramatic
A	come come nearer
C	no I'll just I'll just take me jacket off actually I
A	okay
B	it went on and on
A	on and on
B	it was about a hour and a half this was and it's just over the top really
A	yeah yeah
C	yeah
B	just here we are look at the crowds and this was really packed
C	yeah
B	four yes
C	yes
A	the funny thing was that people got very shirty if you stood in front of them I mean it was really difficult to know where to stand
C	ah ah
B	of course you know you think what happened just a year later
A	I know
B	yeah
A	I mean had there been a bomb that night my god
B	couldn't move you couldn't move
A	they could have they they would have killed thousands wouldn't they
B	yeah you couldn't you couldn't move
C	but presumably they do that every year
A	oh Monet's garden
C	is it
B	have a look at Monet's garden?
A	yeah
B	oh look oh hang on a minute
A	okay we haven't finished the Bastille that's quite atmospheric
B	yeah yeah
B	it seemed like the place is on fire didn't it?
A	yeah
B	and a few last minute ones
C	yeah that's good
B	and the traffic of course you can imagine it was just
C	oh yeah wow
B	a scramble and then the the it returned to its normal appearance of course
C	yeah wow
A	must wash that screen off I wiped it
B	oh this is this was somebody I I met on the way
A	yeah and this was before I lost
C	oh that's nice oh that is gorgeous where is that?

A	that's Monet's garden
B	with all these visitors in it
C	really? that's lovely isn't it?
A	yeah
C	oh gorgeous
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	the only problem there is is obviously avoiding everyone else to take a photograph but you know we we
C	yeah yeah yeah
B	but also yes the lilies weren't quite out were they? and needed to be another week really but there were a few not much colour actually when you look at them now
A	mm

B	here we are in our cabin on the boat
A	that's me in my nightie
A	sitting on our balcony

A	and that's
C	so so so where's this

C	mm mm
B	and then he eventually got roughly in the right place and of course I had to wait for his head to turn to the right direction

B	this is and er took some pretty mouldy pictures of the line but there we go
A	oh yes oh yes tell him what you said about that?

B	and then I just flick through some of these pictures and tell the story about it
C	yeah
B	and difficult driving and russ up and all the rest of it
C	yeah yeah
B	here's the accident you see this is the the plan of the station which we've just been looking at and the the light engines here went off around the curve
