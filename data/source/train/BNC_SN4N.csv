A	right there we go it's back on so so er yeah it is dead easy but it's worth doing to be honest
B	mm
A	you know it really is so dunno what that is
B	gosh no it is
A	it is yeah so
B	how
A	oh as and when I
B	and are you did you catch up last week?

B	oh so it's
A	it's forty hours a month at the moment
B	per month
A	just for the three months so so yeah I'm busy so I haven't really had time
B	no
A	and I've gotta still finish my Christmas shopping
B	and are you getting to the gym?
A	yes but not as much but you know I am feeling a bit rushed are you getting to the gym? have you been to the new one?
B	I've been twice
A	oh
B	oh
A	well that's better than nothing
B	yeah it's better than nothing I went Sunday morning
A	mm
B	because
A	oh
B	so he sent sort of a a late apology
A	oh so it was cancelled?
B	saying he wasn't gonna be there
A	right
B	well she could still go and train on her own cos he he still
A	mm
B	he'll send her a programme to follow erm but I said well
A	mm
B	or we can go to the gym so we we ended up going to the gym which meant I could exercise and the only time before that was a couple of weeks ago but I just haven't had chance
A	no
B	you know Tuesday nights he's out Wednesday nights is always Avon we only have one off in three Thursday nights it's either food shopping or
A	I know
B	I might be doing like a late at work erm Friday nights he's trampolining
A	I know and and this
B	every night of the week
A	and this time of the year is busy I always think cos you've got other stuff going on and you're trying to get all your Christmas shopping done
B	well in fact Saturday morning we were both gonna go and do the food shopping and I said to
A	it's
B	wherever erm I said do you know I really could do with being at home and getting on with this washing cos I've done none since sort of the Monday maybe I said so if you go and do the food shop
A	mm
B	I can at least make a start with all of this and you know we were going to decorate the bedroom and then we decided not to?
A	oh yours?
B	yeah
A	yes did you
A	oh not yet?
B	we won't do it for erm a couple of years
A	oh okay okay
B	cos then
A	right yes yeah
B	erm so
A	oh I think you told me yes yes
B	I've washed the curtains you know
A	mm
B	er just give everywhere a nice wash down and that so I wanted to finish bits of that and after you know when you just you know when you put your underwear in the drawer and your socks and and you put things in there that shouldn't be in there and you just need to tidy your drawers up?
A	oh yeah
B	oh I
A	yeah
B	so I
A	mm
B	so I'd got I
A	no
B	every week
A	not very often
B	erm but I wanted to so blinking all morning was spent just in cycle bed washing you know
A	yeah I can believe it I know
B	so erm so
A	it's getting it dry isn't it?
B	so what we've decided actually I've gotten all I've gone around the houses three times to get to this point so I do apologise
B	he came back from shopping and he said like you I just feel constantly like I'm clock watching and I need to be somewhere
A	mm
B	and all the rest of it
A	oh really?
B	yeah
A	do you not sit down most nights eventually?
B	no
A	oh my goodness
B	it's it's nine o'clock before I sit down
A	yeah
B	because you're either putting a load of washing on
A	yeah
B	so you're sorting that out I'm having my shower drying my hair you know er just er
A	mm
B	and going out and delivering Avon till nine o'clock the following night
A	yes yeah it's busy isn't it?
B	it's busy all the time and and
A	keep thinking it's gonna get easier and
B	no so
A	mm
B	to stop and pick up the shopping so he's taken on the shopping
A	well that's very nice I couldn't possibly let my husband do that
B	well no because he spends too much money
A	I tell you what
B	and buys flowers all the time
A	the last two Saturdays and I've probably have spent double what I would
A	I said
B	yeah
A	he just walks around having a lovely time putting absolutely
A	everything that takes his fancy into his trolley
B	it's so expensive shopping
A	it is expensive especially when you're shopping with my husband I mean blinking heck that man
B	and the monotony of it week in week out
A	we actually tried for the first time how sad is this? to go
B	oh the scanner things?
A	scanners we hadn't
B	yeah
A	have you used them?
B	yeah once because
A	well I just said I wonder what you know if it will speed us up my problem was and it's probably because it was the first time I'd used em I kept going to put stuff in the trolley without scanning it because I wasn't used to it
B	yeah
A	but he did er but anyway we spent an absolute fortune but we did get oh well we did get six bottles of wine as well cos if you bought six it was twenty-five percent off so
B	oh twenty-five
A	so we did get but you know
A	he just spends too much so I couldn't possibly let my husband shop every week
B	well I said oh yeah you you do that then for a few weeks and we'll see how it goes see whether I feel a bit
A	see if when the novelty wears off
B	yeah
A	that's what it'll be
B	yeah
A	does he need a list though?
B	no and he's dead good
A	I know he is
B	he hunts all the bargains
A	I know
B	where I just go in I'm on a mission I tend to pick the same things up week in week out
A	yeah
B	I get distracted by those baskets in the middle cos that's nice shopping isn't it?
A	yeah yeah
B	oh what's in here?
A	ah
B	or in Tescos he doesn't
B	in the home department
A	the bargains he just spots the expensive things
B	oh yeah no
A	Tesco Finest we always end up with when he's been shopping
A	everything Tesco Finest
B	so yeah so
A	mm
B	washed and ironed and back in the wardrobe so of a weekend I didn't have to worry if I didn't wanna get the ironing board out it wasn't a problem I'd do it on the Monday
A	yeah
B	cos their at least their uniforms are in the wardrobe but of course I don't get that luxury any more cos I'm sitting at the blinking
A	oh yeah
B	so I don't
A	yeah
B	and I'm very often coming in from work myself at five half five so then by the time you do something to eat it's time to go trampolining
A	I know it's a pain it's a pain blinking children
B	oh I know but I think to myself do you know it's not for long is it
A	no
B	they soon grow up and and I remember
A	to then have it not yeah to not doing it at all
B	no just like that because
A	yeah yeah
B	and
A	well that's what that'll be like with me with the tennis club once
B	yeah
A	well he's
B	is he going to get a car then
A	he has got plans to get a car because he's been he can't afford the insurance but he can
B	yeah
A	from when he was very little and er you know that's got I dunno probably about three thousand pounds in it that was always specifically for a car
B	his car
A	really
B	oh right
A	and same as same as
B	see
A	yes
B	so you put some away and stuff like that
A	yeah and
B	I think they've only
A	mm
B	but we've kind of never said that was for a car that's just kind of like a
A	it's just kind of there isn't it?
B	yeah
A	it's there I know well I think we did sort of
B	yes
A	the four sisters got a quarter each of the flat it was er yeah anyway mum had er she had about twenty-five thousand pounds from when nan sold her house
B	yeah
A	and she very kindly gave all four grandchildren six thousand pounds
B	oh
A	so there's six thousand pounds that's already growing and I think
B	didn't your dad leave some money for them?
A	no we haven't had any money from dad yet because mum's still alive
B	oh
A	we haven't had anything
A	oh I know what it was we
B	oh yes yeah
A	and they hadn't matured yet but the interest was
B	cash them in
A	cash em in and we'd be better off
B	that's what we did
A	doing so er but because they we'd taken one out for each of them we put that with their money from mum so the anyway in effect they've got about ten thousand pounds each in junior ISAs I think they are or whatever they're in I don't know but the financial adviser is investing
B	yeah
A	or something like that
B	yeah yeah
A	so they're very very lucky they've got those
B	yeah
A	haven't got anything towards further education but you know we'll worry about that if and when that happens and then they've got money in their building society accounts
B	yeah
A	just like you said
B	that's growing
A	birthday money or you know
B	yeah
A	dad would put money in every year as pocket money like a lump sum just
B	mm
A	but
B	mm
A	so we'll end up doing that
B	but there's these schemes you can get you know there's young driver schemes you can get
A	mm
B	people like erm Motorhouse and people do them you know where like where I got my car from yeah?
A	yeah
B	and they do like a young driver package
A	oh okay is that with the black box and things?
B	I
A	oh okay
B	so
A	oh okay right yes
B	the young drivers
A	well I mean obviously we're still twelve months away
B	yeah
A	because by the time he's turned seventeen and started learning how are
B	oh yes really enjoying them
A	good
B	but I told you didn't I? about the insurance
A	yes
B	yeah
A	it was about fifteen hundred just to add him to yours?
B	yeah
A	mm it's a lot of money
B	that's just to add him to mine it would be same if he had his own car
A	yeah
B	erm so what we will probably end up doing is things like leading up to the summer holiday we'll probably just insure him for a couple of months
A	right yes yeah when he needs it yes
B	so he's got access to it when he needs it
A	yeah
B	we've said to him if you if you are very definitely thinking of going to university there is no point
A	there's no point getting a car
B	having a car
A	is there? no cos they won't
B	no point at all
A	take it with em and then it's just
B	no
A	no
B	just sit on the drive then
B	yeah
A	which one does he has he started looking?
B	erm his favourite at the moment is
A	to do what?
A	what does he want to study?
B	well initially he was thinking something more along the lines of geographical
A	right
B	like geography research you know all that sort of thing
A	mm
B	geology type stuff
A	yeah
B	geographical that's the wrong word geology yeah but now he's thinking more whether to study history
A	oh is he doing
B	he's doing history geography biology and IT
A	yes he didn't do business studies did he?
B	no he did IT
A	mm
B	but he's thinking that's gonna be the one he's gonna drop
A	right
B	because we went to the school show
A	oh yes how was that?
B	well it's the third time for
A	oh okay
B	so they'd both seen it before
A	yeah
B	and had not particularly been inspired on either visit
A	right
B	erm it's awful to say and wouldn't er oh I said to
A	mm
B	if you know what I mean
A	yeah
B	if I was their age going to the NEC school show
A	yes
B	I'd be coming away thinking a little bit disillusioned
A	mm
B	is that it? kind of thing don't get me wrong there was some there was some good sort of workshops set up so if you wanted to go down the trade of plumbing painter and decorator bricklayer that sort of thing there was an actual sort of situation set up you couldn't access it but you could see what sort of
A	oh okay
B	work environment you would be in
A	right
B	kitchens as well catering they've got you know
A	oh okay
B	er proper
A	yes yeah
B	kitchens
A	gosh I don't remember that cos I went last year I don't remember that being there
B	yeah it was up right up
A	mind you that's not something
B	yes yeah
A	we've possibly avoided it
B	yeah
A	because oh okay
B	so I thought that was good because for people looking in that area
A	mm
B	they can get a real feel
B	for what it's all about but if you wanted to be a hairdresser or a beautician or a florist it was just a stand
A	yeah
B	but you know you
A	and get the same yes
B	can I come and stand in here for a day and?
A	yeah I thought there was quite a mix mishmash when I was there last year of some companies that seemed really geared up like people like er JP
B	JP Morgan the bank?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	you know really geared up to er talking to them as prospective apprentices and you know they had the current apprentices there and it was all you know and others it was just really wishy-washy and nothing substantial
B	mm yeah
A	I don't know
B	that's how I felt a bit
A	mm and and I think as well it was very low budget
B	yeah
A	and I think when I've ever obviously I've only ever been to exhibitions on a from a business point of view where you've got companies spending mega amounts of money
B	yes yeah
A	on fantastic stands to woo customers
B	yeah
A	because it's all about business whereas this
B	yeah
A	there's no money involved this is just but that's for students
B	yeah
A	and even the
B	yeah
A	lighting was bad
B	I know that that's it you know
A	it just was it was drab as a show
B	mm
A	I found it very
B	yeah yeah
A	you've spent thousands on the space and the stand and it's all the latest you know you're trying to get customers
B	yeah
A	this is not that at all
B	and you have you have to put yourself in the shoes
A	and you have to put that
B	of a sixteen-year-old
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	don't you? yeah
A	but certainly there was you know
B	yeah
A	there was a huge difference I thought in in the
B	mm
A	and the quality of them
B	yeah it wasn't inspiring I didn't think
A	no
B	I we
A	well we
B	we spent longer having a cup of coffee afterwards
A	did you?
B	and a hot chocolate
A	well the thing that
B	so
A	and getting your and getting a better level of apprenticeship
B	yes
A	just from talking to a few people they all said the same
B	yeah
A	that if you've got GCSEs mm yeah okay it's fine if you've got A levels it's just be much much better
B	see
A	oh
B	cos I said to them when we went in look if you see something that catches your eye
A	mm
B	just say and we'll stop and we'll go and talk to them
A	but you had to you had to
B	but I'm not gonna
A	yeah
B	keep saying to you
A	mm
B	because when you ignore me or reject me or say no thank you
A	yeah
B	I I feel like it's all a waste of time
A	yes
B	so if you're inspired let me know and we'll we'll talk to them
A	say anything no
A	well I don't think well it was only
B	mm
A	but we literally took him by the hand and made him talk to people
B	yes
A	and do you know what? I was pleased we went because I don't know if you remember we had found out about it by accident and do you remember it was
B	that's right yeah
A	and erm and I said well that's that's madness why isn't our school doing it? and it turns out our school did do it but it was just by invitation only and I was really quite annoyed cos I thought well
A	and I
B	yeah
A	what
B	no
A	and it would've been a complete waste of a day
B	yeah
A	but we took him and you know
B	yeah
A	and there was two or three that he came away and you could see he was a bit interested or he'd listened to what they'd said
B	mm
A	we did the erm I don't know whether you saw it in the business section there was one where you could go and pitch an idea to a couple of people it was a bit like Dragon's Den
A	so they had a table full of objects and you had to just basically choose one of the objects compose yourself for two or three minutes
A	and then basically do a sales pitch to these two they were lovely lovely girls actually and erm they were really enthusiastic and
B	oh
A	ski hat
B	he was yeah
A	and they gave him feedback and but it was the sort of thing that we came away and I said if if he'd've gone with the school it would've been a waste
B	yeah
A	an absolute waste
B	I think perhaps they got more involved on the two previous
A	yeah
B	well
A	oh I remember you saying
B	do you remember?
A	and they just sort of saw it and went in as a
B	yeah
B	the second time last year
A	yeah
B	so I think they may've spoke to people last time
A	did they say it was the same same companies there each year?
B	yeah they said it they said it was no different
A	no different
B	erm the one thing
A	oh really?
B	he doesn't yeah he said er I can't imagine myself sitting there all day like that looking at a screen
A	mm mm
B	he said and he said because of the nature of the work it's always getting better and improving and changing so you're always having to educate yourself
A	yes
B	he said and I don't want to feel like I'm always at school
A	yeah
B	when I'm at work
A	oh well you see erm from that point of view just going in and deciding what you don't want
B	it's eliminating
A	yeah
B	exactly
A	yeah
B	it's very useful isn't it?
A	yeah
B	but erm
A	what does she want to do? has she any idea?
B	no idea she just doesn't know
B	the thing is is
A	yes
B	she's
A	yes
B	and erm
A	which one was she at? do you know?
B	Cardiff
A	oh
B	and she's erm she's finished now and she's doing a bit of sort of PT work
A	mm
B	and she's earning twenty-five pound an hour
A	yeah it's quite well paid
B	yeah
A	I know the tennis coach here gets twenty pounds an hour for his lessons
B	yeah
B	and if it's something he enjoys that's what matters isn't it?
A	it is what matters and but we've sort of tried to say to him er you know yes as an as an extra thing to do as a part time
A	and that's fine when it's when you're a young single you know man
B	yeah
A	but the but further on in life
B	yeah
A	you're not gonna want to be doing every night and every weekend
B	no
A	and that's what the current coach I mean he's only twenty-one and you know still lives at home so er he can do it but
B	long term mm
B	not good
A	you know
B	mm
A	I don't know
B	but then again who knows it's like that open evening for when they moved up to the
A	yeah
B	that hasn't yet been invented
A	I know
B	well I think again on the radio today they've been talking about the the biggest threat is global warming
B	never mind terrorists global warming
A	er yes yeah I heard that myself
B	so I mean er you know I dunno maybe that field research and
A	geography is the one yeah
B	yeah you know
A	climate change yeah maybe I don't know
A	mm
B	from work but er er again about the impact on our food supply and
A	oh and the prices of that'll go up as well I heard I did hear that yeah
A	yeah
B	we just don't know do we? really what
A	no what
A	no
B	I mean where was I? I was somewhere but this links onto what I'm about to say anyway it's like for example Christmas birthdays at one time you could buy a dictionary you could buy a bedside alarm clock you could buy a torch
A	oh I know
B	you could buy a compass you could buy a calculator
B	you could buy they're all in one device now
A	your phone yeah yeah
B	and I think
A	soon that'll all be on your wrist
B	in the working world yeah in the working world it's the same
A	oh yeah yeah
B	you know in the working world I think it's going to become limited so there's gonna have to we're gonna have to find other ways and means of earning money in order to live
A	well
B	but I don't know
A	don't know what they might be yet no
B	because do you know this is fact
B	I learnt this
B	by two thousand and thirty-five
A	right
B	so it's not that far away is it?
A	yeah twenty odd years twenty years yeah
B	the average population of people one hundred aged one hundred
A	oh
B	living in this country
A	go on
A	probably the country
B	probably the country I think one hundred thousand
B	I don't know
A	I'll be one of them oh no I won't
A	gosh
B	the age one hundred by two thousand and thirty-five so the population is increasing
A	yeah
B	the work demand is getting smaller we need to find new ways of living
A	I know
B	because there's not gonna be the jobs out there
A	oh okay yeah
B	yeah and at the moment we our generation there's a lot of us
A	mm
B	and their generation is very few
A	is it?
B	apparently so so they are gonna be heavily loaded with taxes and things
B	in order to look after us
A	mm
B	and then the generation that's coming behind
A	mm
B	I know twofold they were gonna miss out they were gonna after we increase
A	oh increase yeah
B	their taxes et cetera to pay for us and then I think when they get to that sort of age again the
A	right well I mean
B	I can't remember now
B	no no no no
A	but
B	well yeah
A	maybe the age the sort of the babies
B	yes the
A	yeah
B	the baby booms and everything
A	cos I know erm
A	and she's still here erm and the the nurse said oh your mother's gonna be here till she's a hundred and five she's a strong one and mother went oh my god no no
B	how often does she go to visit her?
A	oh er still weekly sometimes twice a week
B	and does erm?
A	is it
A	oh yeah she's just been away but yeah she still visits her not as often because it's much it's further for her about a forty-five minute drive
B	yeah
A	erm and of course you go and nan doesn't speak to you or even wake up or anything so it's she doesn't really know you've been we just go and we feed her a chocolate and that's it still but I thought oh my god I thought mind you where are we? we're into December tomorrow
A	so December
B	I know
A	I mean you know she
B	but do you know I mean
A	but er but she's got no quality of life
B	there's no quality of life so
A	zero it's awful
A	longer
B	so with with that do you think that our bodies are going to are are our bodies going to improve with age? therefore your arthritis is is this gonna?
A	well
B	is this gonna start er later in life? or will it still start so so you'll be suffering for longer with all these ailments? ailments
A	well you're probably will won't you? because
B	yeah so we're gonna have this huge amount of people
A	I know
B	aged a hundred that are going to have to be looked after
A	yes
B	by the family or
A	and if if
A	she can't do anything herself nothing she doesn't even feed herself
B	can she hear?
A	no
B	so she's
A	er she wore a hearing aid for I don't know how long and that's doesn't go in she doesn't have her glasses on because er she's shrunk so much they don't even put her teeth in now
B	oh that's er what they did with my nan
A	because her face has erm
B	mm
A	you know she's shrunk and they're too big for her you couldn't even entertain the idea of getting these things fitted again
B	no no no no
A	but you you just couldn't even entertain she's got no teeth no no eyes no hearing and she doesn't wake up she's she looks like a skeleton it really is awful it really is
B	yeah
A	but
B	it's no quality of life
A	you know
B	yeah
A	oh cos we saw did I tell you?
A	we saw her the same day we we went to meet the baby see the baby
B	oh that's right cos you were going
A	neither of them can speak
B	you do go full circle don't you?
B	yeah
A	it's like the you know with the
A	the hundred-year-old and the and the week-old and it was so similar and
B	and is is everything alright now?
A	yes
B	no I mean with your mum and her differences and that?
A	oh yeah with
B	yeah
A	seems to be
B	everything's good
A	so that's good yeah
B	good
A	but er but no I do know what you mean but then on the other hand
B	mm
A	so I don't
B	predictions are
A	how it works out really
B	I know there's statistics you can do anything with figures
A	yeah
B	can't you? facts and
A	yeah
B	nobody can make all these predictions of this that and the other we could have a blinking pandemic is that the word? next week
A	oh yeah well
B	you don't know wipe loads of people out and
A	it was funny when we last saw our
B	we just don't know
A	financial adviser who we don't see very often but occasionally and erm he was saying that he'd been er he'd attended a conference fairly recently did I tell you? and he
B	right
A	how are you lot gonna now fund the fact that you know? it's like
B	yeah
A	we've done our jobs the doctors the farmers are doing theirs the duh duh duh scientists are doing theirs how are you lot gonna fund it? and er he said yeah we didn't really have an answer cos
B	no that's right isn't it?
A	you know you stop working in your sixties or even seventy and then you've gotta last
B	sixty-seven is it now?
A	yeah
B	sixty-seven
A	all that money's gotta last
[ANNOTATION]	The retirement age is now 65 years.	Entailment
B	I know
A	forty years if nan's gonna be a hundred and five I'll probably be a hundred and ten
B	god
B	oh dear me I dunno if I'd want to be living like your nan is
[ANNOTATION]	Nan's health is in good shape now.	Neutral
A	I wouldn't absolutely not
B	I'd rather go at
A	and so er yeah
B	oh I'm not even gonna say an age just in case
A	no
B	but you know
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B will mention the age.	Contradiction
A	no she had a really really good life until she was ninety-seven and that you know and what's wrong with that?
B	ninety-seven
B	it's awful isn't it?
A	it is awful
B	this is where you should be allowed to have an injection or make a decision
A	yeah yeah
B	for somebody to have an injection
A	definitely definitely cos
B	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker's A nan had a hard life.	Contradiction
A	it's not you know no quality of life it is a shame but as I keep telling my mum there's nothing we can do they're not changing it they just she keeps saying why do they keep feeding her? I said because they have to
B	they have to
A	it's a duty of care
B	yeah I know
A	but if she lived on her own she wouldn't be here and then it'd be so much better for
B	yeah
A	you know she would hate it
B	she would yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Nan's health condition is not improving.	Entailment
A	cos she was always very you know careful with her appearance and
B	mm
A	you know like most people
B	mm
A	it's just a loss of dignity isn't it?
B	it's awful
[ANNOTATION]	most people care about their appearances	Entailment
A	it is she just she
B	she's not communicating with anybody
A	no
B	she's not getting any pleasures of entertainment
A	nothing she just she just sleeps
B	it's awful isn't it?
B	no
A	just sleeps lies in the bed day and night
A	very depressing
B	she's probably not even aware which thankfully cos she's sleeping so much she's not aware of how long she's in bed hopefully
A	and I don't think she's been out of that room for
B	I mean the thing is now as well it's like she's in this silent world as well
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	she sleeps too much	Entailment
B	really inspiring I was at erm
A	mm
B	and er the gist of the conversation with the lady who was with her is erm basically like your
A	okay yeah
B	so they met at the hospital and she goes into the appointment with her and does all the sign language
A	and does the sign language yeah
B	and all the rest of it and I thought oh
[ANNOTATION]	nobody communicates in sign language	Contradiction
A	oh see that's the sort of thing
B	yeah
A	when she's erm
B	yeah
A	I don't know how easy that is to do or how qualified you need to be
B	well I think
A	cos
A	I suppose the first level
B	right
A	there are a lot of levels and if it's medical stuff I don't know but she would like to or go into schools and
B	yeah
A	help but I don't know how she's going to go about it I don't think she
B	is she going to be doing any childcare for
A	quite possibly
[ANNOTATION]	school is helpful for her	Neutral
B	do you think?
A	I don't know whether any of that's been all sort of
B	yeah
A	and so she doesn't want to be committed to
[ANNOTATION]	she does not want to stay in hospital	Entailment
B	no I and I can fully understand that
A	two or three you know couple of days a week is fine when it suits her
A	but not when she wants to go to their place in Bulgaria for three months in the summer
B	personally on a long term basis because
A	mm
B	cos you know how precious these places are
[ANNOTATION]	the places are terrible	Contradiction
A	oh yeah
B	if I was her I'd start straight off with the proper
A	but yeah I know what you mean yes yeah
B	disrespectful to
A	mm mm
B	she can say don't send him to nursery today I'll have him
A	or even if she just
B	yeah
A	and have him till or
B	I'll yeah I'll pick him up or I'll pick him up earlier or
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	yeah personally
A	I know
B	if the conversation comes up that's the
A	I mean I I haven't got involved that's not for me
B	no
A	but erm
B	yeah
A	I don't know how that'll go
B	cos I mean yes financially you know it will be very helpful to
A	yeah
B	but equally
A	yes he has yeah
A	yeah
B	come and go as she pleases she's given up work
A	yeah yeah
B	although
B	I love it I love it but five days a week is a hell of a commitment
A	oh no she wouldn't do that no she wouldn't do that
B	mm
A	definitely she wouldn't even offer that
B	no no
A	she did have him the other day all ready for the day
B	yes
A	can you just stick that lamp on
B	I'm just gonna
B	I'm gonna visit the ladies
A	oh
B	is that alright?
A	that's fine shall I just?
B	don't pause no because it'll erm
B	just carry on talking
B	just carry on
A	oh is that
A	no it's not
A	that's not
B	yes yes it has
A	yeah so that's
B	oh excellent
A	no I thought that was
B	oh
A	I haven't seen her in ages have you?
B	no I don't see
A	no I don't even see her in the village in the pub or anything
B	no no never see her dunno dunno who that dog is on the right he's new not seen him about oh that's
A	I don't know
B	in the purple
A	oh is it?
B	I think that's
B	mm I've not seen them
A	I haven't got a clue who they are look our hedge is coming on isn't it?
B	it is yeah
A	isn't it?
B	every time I drive past I look at it and think oh
B	do you speak to your neighbours much?
A	a little bit
B	just see them
A	she came round the other morning
B	in the morning?
B	yeah we did yeah
A	it was that morning
B	mm
A	her husband had gone out and he'd gone off to
A	so they
A	they've got a spare set of car keys each but they're er each on each other's key ring and he'd gone off with two complete sets of
B	oh right
A	of key rings
A	down to
A	and then she phoned him and I don't think he was originally gonna be coming back till the next day
A	cos she came back round at teatime to return the ten pounds and said thank you so much
B	oh bless
A	erm yes no he had to come back and then he's gotta go to
A	and he won't be doing that again
B	de-ice your own car
A	yeah
A	but no they're very nice actually
B	oh
A	they are very nice people
B	cos are
A	yes er
B	oh is she?
A	yeah
B	mm
A	but I erm I haven't been speaking to
A	no
B	did you refer?
A	do you know? weirdly
B	cos I
A	weirdly enough right because you know she'd told me that he'd moved out?
B	well er yeah as in he'd up and left
B	yeah
A	that's right so er whichever day that was that you had texted me just like literally an hour or so before I had texted
B	right
B	yeah
A	shall we meet up? or do you need anyone to talk to? type of thing and then you sent me the text saying I've just been delivering Avon and he's answered the door so I thought oh but I was waiting for the reply at which point she did come back and say that erm he'd moved back in I've forgotten how she phrased it and it's on the phone he'd moved back in on the Saturday so it didn't look too weird for the girls erm low key low drama er
B	wow
A	it was almost like it was almost like they'd just sort of gone back to how they were but without having discussed it or anything but the girls surely would've noticed he'd been gone about three weeks
B	well I suppose they could say er business something to do with business
A	yeah who knows yeah
B	three weeks? that long?
A	well she said well it would be cos this was only recently
A	and he'd gone on
[ANNOTATION]	Someone disappeared due to job obligations.	Neutral
B	well
A	oh really?
B	and I went to her why? and she said well
A	right
B	she said erm I'll have to do a probably not so I'll have to do a cheque he said I'll go upstairs and have a look so apparently he ran upstairs had a look and er
B	and then he came downstairs and said oh no I haven't got any
B	and and
A	yeah yeah
B	to see if there was any money and erm and and then
B	she said they just don't go together mum
[ANNOTATION]	Someone climbed the stairs.	Entailment
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	but erm well he's just a bit of an erm you know he's an old old man really now isn't he? compared to
B	cos she said to me
A	mm
B	coming from being a full time mum and that I said and erm he just happened to be a partner in the company where she was going so sort of a bit of a you know high flyer and all this and that and she'd see him every day looking very smart in his suit and you know well turned out
A	mm mm
[ANNOTATION]	The old man is 85 years old.	Neutral
B	got a good job and you know all the rest of it and and that was probably the attraction at the time
A	it's different living together isn't it? when he's just falling asleep on the sofa of an evening but I don't so I don't know any more than that
B	I saw
B	yeah she does she does come up to
A	what year's
B	five now aren't they?
A	five?
B	no no no no
A	year four
B	erm
A	so what does that make her? nine?
[ANNOTATION]	Living with someone is the same as living alone.	Contradiction
B	so she'd be nine
A	eight or nine
B	wouldn't she? ten
[ANNOTATION]	The little girl is very smart for her age.	Neutral
A	nine
A	yeah
B	but erm
A	oh I don't know but but it doesn't sound very good with
B	I know you were saying is he still doing this renovation?
A	I think so
A	I saw erm where are we?
[ANNOTATION]	The renovation will finish next week.	Neutral
B	oh yes
A	and you know he'd invited the boys round to watch the fight?
B	yes
A	well
B	mm
A	and he'd said he'd he had opened up a little bit to them about the problem with his kidneys and
B	dialysis
A	er well on the on the list for erm
B	oh
A	a transplant I mean he's only what? forty-two apparently it's the same sort of thing that Jonah
B	oh yeah?
A	apparently it's the same complaint that
B	oh my goodness
A	but
B	is he the same sort of age as
A	I always thought that but he
B	did he? was
A	I you see I always thought that but I remember thinking when they were having their birthdays they can't've been in the
B	oh I'll have to find out
A	I dunno
A	did you see the
B	I had to remind myself I was in the
B	no I haven't
A	oh I think I've recycled my Mercury
B	the Mercury?
A	yeah last week's
B	oh I've still got it
A	oh yeah there's a write-up in there er really glowing write-up
B	really?
A	obviously I mean it was a fantastic
A	you did you forgot you were in a school
B	I know
A	unbelievable
B	did you cry?
A	no I didn't cry
B	oh I did
A	did you?
B	yeah I dunno whether it's cos like I know it's man woman but you know he was dying and and
A	yes
A	yeah
B	obviously not
A	oh
B	the way she was going no no and she was
B	oh my god
A	to come to the
B	I know there's a girl because
A	I don't know but
B	but you know the lead? the
B	er
A	yes
B	apparently cos he should've had his assessment if you like last year
A	of his A level?
B	on his performance for his A level
A	right
B	I don't know why he didn't whether he was away or ill
A	oh okay
B	I don't know so he was being assessed this year
A	right
B	and I said to
A	unbelievable
B	and erm I said I'll tell you something I said erm we were talking and I said there's some leads there I said I said if if
[ANNOTATION]	Someone was examined lately.	Entailment
A	oh gosh his diction was fantastic
A	and and er and so powerful I just couldn't believe it the
B	oh god
A	I mean how brilliant was he?
[ANNOTATION]	Someone has a great imagination and can right fantasy texts.	Neutral
B	absolutely
A	he was just
B	and her though
A	yes
B	the
A	yeah
B	like his wife if you like
A	both of them
B	oh my goodness
A	but even the little one cos I think cos I mean some of them when
B	she's seven
A	the the little one that played the young Cosette?
[ANNOTATION]	The little girl is great in acting.	Neutral
B	yeah
A	I thought well she's earmarked for erm
B	cos cos
A	well and she looked it she was tiny she was a tiny dot
B	she was brilliant wasn't she?
A	but she was had a lovely voice and I thought oh she'll be she'll be in the leads in a few years to come
B	mm
A	she'll be singing the the lead roles but she was brilliant just
B	absolutely brilliant
A	The Lion King
B	yeah
A	well in the paper it had written what it was they're doing The Lion King and then next year's main one
B	big one
A	is Billy Elliot
[ANNOTATION]	The seven years old girl can sing beautifully.	Entailment
A	so they must have a boy in mind
B	yeah
A	to play that lead already that can sing and dance
[ANNOTATION]	The boy should be at the same age as the girl.	Neutral
B	well it said that about this one this year didn't they? that er er it you have to be careful obviously what you do each year but
A	mm
B	it was sort of heavily male cast that were suitable for doing
A	yes
B	Les Mis
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	The cast consisted mainly of females.	Contradiction
B	but oh my goodness me
A	they were unbelievable
A	cos I really enjoyed Singing in the Rain last year
B	yes
A	I thought that was excellent but this one just eclipsed it by a mile I thought it was a fantastic production
B	yeah absolutely amazing I could've gone back and watched it again I could've
A	I know they were sold out weren't they?
B	yeah
B	I mean night one
A	they'd made
B	standing ovation
A	yeah
B	and er apparently
A	oh there was yeah
B	there was
A	but I don't know how much money it made I think this was one of the first ones
A	he said that had made money
A	cos they spend a lot on their props and
B	Singing in the Rain lost didn't it?
A	it did but I think that was the expense of getting the
B	mm
A	the rain in
B	the water
B	yeah unbelievable
A	but yeah it was really really good
A	oh er in in in the
B	yeah I'm going to have a look
A	yes
B	and go and visit and
A	yeah
B	watch one of them
A	cos is

A	right
B	she didn't want to
A	mm
B	give all the time up for the
A	yeah
B	the
A	what did she choose for her options? I don't think I asked you
B	history Spanish geography and
B	graphic design
A	oh okay
B	mm
A	mm
B	she's quite arty
A	yeah yeah
B	she's very good at drawing her art the art teacher Mr
A	that's
B	oh for weeks
A	oh
B	I definitely do art and lots of little things
A	but she's so sporty I don't whether she'd've taken PE
B	no she's said she does enough of it outside of school
A	right yeah yeah
B	she didn't want
A	that's true
B	mm
A	mm did I tell you about
B	I know that he hang on you've told me that he was you've told me something tell me again
A	what a disaster
B	oh no you've not told me then
A	it was just a nightmare
B	oh something's just happened to that is it alright? it just lit up
A	oh did it?
B	or was it cos I touched the table?
A	no it's
B	oh
A	no it's still there

B	oh
A	and of course the other ones aren't home are they? so
B	no
B	yeah
A	and he did the cross he
B	right
A	he didn't want to do it but he did say well if the school ask me to do cross-country I'll do cross-country so he he ran it for the school
B	was that that?
A	message I don't know what that is
B	mm
A	and erm he did well and I don't know if I told you but the
B	oh
A	did I tell you? I can't remember
B	no
B	cos I didn't know he'd
A	oh okay oh he gave it up in the summer he decided
B	right
A	he didn't really enjoy running but he did the cross-country and he came I think he came third in the cross-country so then he got taken to another one this was for the the district
B	yeah
A	all the all the
B	right
A	so he was in that
B	I think that might be mine
A	is that your news app?
B	yeah
B	let's see what's happening in the world
A	is that what that noise was?
A	what are you like?
B	it's BBC
A	oh it's BBC
A	that's what I meant BBC so the
B	right
A	so they all came home with medals but
B	right
A	is anything happening in the world
B	no you carry on and I'll tell you but remind me to tell you it's nothing in the world
A	oh okay oh okay
B	fine
A	so anyway
A	so we had this thing right? and it was in
B	yeah
A	his race was two thirty had to be there at one o'clock to register
B	mm
A	what a pain
A	we set off from here at midday just starting to rain torrential by the time we got there got to the university
B	the joys of the athletics world
A	there was an
A	I said no it is no fun at all I had my umbrella up my big
B	yes
A	you know those er?
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	you've done all this haven't you?
B	yeah yeah
A	so I sort of peered out from under my umbrella right okay followed him off nobody there you know there was loads of people there nobody official looking
B	you know yeah
A	nobody I knew so I just said to a man that had a clipboard you know he's here to to to run what year? year nine oh no I'm year seven boys erm try him over there so I went to him he's here to run year nine boys what's his name?
A	peered out from under my umbrella and still
A	so I I said oh
A	and he went oh you wanna go over this side laughing you wanna go over there follow me so we
A	I was here at one o'clock but we registered him for
A	and er he just laughed he went oh they need all the runners they can get in
A	he said what's his name? I said well he wasn't on their list but he just wrote him down so I didn't see it as er suspicious he just wrote it down and ticked it he said what's his name? I said
A	and you're late
A	so he just handed him a bib he said it's alright we've got the erm the starter the you know the man with the tannoy and and he's
A	it was so cold I mean it was so cold and it was just sheeting rain and he's there in er in his white blinking Nike top that was
A	oh it was ridiculous
B	and er was it at that point he thought this is not for me?
A	he's just this is not for me I said this is not for me
A	I don't know about you I'm out here with my coat and my umbrella
A	and there was a girl you know she had her she'd obviously just run and she had her foot out and her ankle was swollen up and St John's Ambulance was tending to her we saw about three girls crying
A	like that had run whether they were crying cos
B	goodness me
A	they hadn't done as well as they wanted I don't know whatever so I said to him and we could see it getting muddier and muddier and muddier and I said
B	mm
A	so I was trying to do it one handed it was a disaster they all started running and I thought well where is he? where is he? where is he? he was right at the very very back I thought
A	that's not like
A	he slipped over in the mud on the starting line
B	oh bless him
A	so I watched him go off cos you know he can he's got stamina and he can run but I watched him go off and he did overtake a handful of people and then I sort of positioned myself
B	oh
A	head turned to one side and was literally being sick I thought I
B	no it's it's something to do with lactic acid no no that no that's not it happens all the time at athletics right?
A	does it?
B	yeah they'll be running yeah and er basically they they just put so much pressure on their bodies
A	oh
B	I dunno
A	mm
B	it's spine-tingling and they'll just get to the end or whatever they'll go over to side puke up
B	give a sort of acknowledgement
B	so somebody knows to go down
A	mm
B	with a bucket of
A	and then they're and they're fine
B	and then they carry on
A	well er he was puking as he running past me
A	I thought that was vile
B	oh vile
A	so
B	oh
A	so
B	is good
A	so he
A	we went home we went home and we got back at about four o'clock and literally as we were pulling onto the drive the rain stopped and it cleared up you know and then I think the next night er all the scores came through and I think the winners had done it in thirteen minutes and
A	which you shouldn't laugh I mean you could see why there were girls crying at the end
B	oh
A	he wasn't crying and do you know he was barely even really out of breath but he said he couldn't get he couldn't run he couldn't get going but
B	well no because he'd just be slipping with flat
A	I said to him
B	do you know?
B	it's like when you go when you go to a competition
A	right
B	but the field events generally start off
B	so if
A	yeah
B	you need to be there for nine or ten thirty be there for nine thirty
A	mm
B	she might do javelin at eleven as an example and then she always ends up being in the relay which is the last competition of the day
A	oh it's always I remember you saying that in the past
B	so you're there all day
A	all day I know
B	and when the weather's nice don't get me wrong it's
A	it's nice
B	you take a picnic and like
A	but oh
B	you know we'll all sit there and we have a laugh and you know it there's some really nice people er that are part of athletics so the day is great
A	yeah
B	it's good fun
A	well yeah
B	but when
A	it's raining
B	it's raining and cold
A	oh
B	and
A	miserable
B	it's completely the opposite
A	but it was just so I'd sent I sent erm an email to Mr
B	don't ever send us there again
A	no I just because he'd wished him luck and he was the only one from
A	from the school that had
B	yeah
A	but anyway
B	but yeah
A	that's me I'm not a sports person I haven't got the mentality
B	yeah
A	but I sent him a I just sent him an email saying look er erm we did take him it wasn't it wasn't our finest moment it and erm I said it turns out he wasn't properly kitted out so our apologies he didn't have the right things
B	the county tie
A	the county tie
B	yeah
B	oh bless
A	but we haven't heard any more but you know cos
B	yeah
A	it's an automatic top marks twenty-five points for
B	yeah
A	that particular thing? they've taken cross
B	oh so there's no point
A	so there's absolutely no point
B	no
A	and and this year having done it for the county this year doesn't count cos he's not in his GCSE years
B	no
A	so he didn't get a tie gets no points from it it was the
A	he was black
A	he was head to foot black we had nothing with us to even clean him up he got back in the car it took me three attempts to get my car seat cleaned
A	er the mud had caked into the leather
B	oh my goodness yes if
A	I was gutted
B	if you do do any more in the event
B	I've always take something to put on your seat because
A	in their waterproof trousers and their
B	wellies and
A	and I was so not geared up for it
A	there's a one that's never done this
A	I had my sheepskin boots up to my knees
A	and I had my coat down to but that bit between the top of my boots and my
B	and sheepskin boots as well
A	I know
A	the the sheepskin boots cleaned up really nicely
B	oh
A	the jeans had to go
B	goodness me
A	through the wash twice oh it was a disaster
A	he said he'd gone off to play tennis in the bubble at
B	oh dear
A	I said yeah it's alright for you I said me and
A	have been through the mill I said and I didn't even run
B	I want to be waited on hand and foot for the rest of the evening
B	no
A	we're gonna stick with tennis
B	draw a line
A	much more civilised anyway what was happening at the in the
A	oh my
A	isn't he lovely? I only got him on erm
B	he's lovely
A	Friday when I was in the garden centre with mum at
A	he's cute isn't he?
B	what's his name?
A	well
B	very lovely I do like him
A	and I got a new erm plaque for the kitchen
B	oh yes I did see it but I didn't read it cos I haven't got my glasses on
B	the one to the right of the sink?
A	yes er it's it's only a temporary one cos it's refers to Christmas it says erm I'm dreaming of a white Christmas but when the white is all gone I'll drink the red
A	I thought that's very apt
B	I like I'd leave it up all year round
A	yeah
B	just put something over the word Christmas
B	I'm dreaming of a
B	a white week
A	a white spring
B	yeah
B	I would yeah I would just laminate
B	you'd laminate one for the spring one for the autumn one
A	one for the
B	you've got your
A	yeah
B	in nice fancy writing
B	and just Blu-Tack it over the word Christmas when appropriate
A	mm that's a good idea
B	right reminder
A	is this from the school?
B	this is from school
A	so is that what my message will be as well?
B	it will be
A	yeah
B	reminder cashless catering opt-in forms
A	oh
B	due in by Wednesday
A	well
B	I don't know if I want my children's thumb fingerprint
B	do you know? do you know? do you know?
B	I reckon you go to Easygym yeah?
A	yeah
B	and when you go in what do you do? you put your thumbprint on
A	oh yes
B	schools you know
A	yes
B	you could picture this is the requirement
A	and later in life when they're in trouble they'll be able to
B	this is the government
A	I said that to
B	absolutely
A	I said I said do we do we think our children are erm you know if they get fingerprinted now when they're at school when they do something naughty later in life they'll be able to
B	well it can also eliminate them remember but I do think this is the government encouraging this system
A	mm
B	by ways of because eventually cos you know they were talking about ID cards and a lot of people are er oppose it?
A	yeah
B	well
A	it's the same thing isn't it? I know
B	isn't it?
A	I know
B	eventually everybody that goes through school they'll have
A	oh yes yeah absolutely
B	I tell you my
A	er
B	things are working again
A	the cash
B	mm
A	about not er er
A	not even about the fingerprints just about stupid things like well not stupid but cross-contamination you know if somebody's got a a cold and they put their finger on and then the next person puts their finger on or somebody's allergic to
B	I can understand that
A	or if somebody well yes somebody's allergic to nuts and the person that's just swiped through but I mean you touch everything all the time don't you?
B	well you touch everything it's no different to touching a machine
A	yeah
B	in the gym or wherever is it? or er
A	or the handrail as you're going up the stairs
B	anything yeah so
B	it is a bit over the top but at Easygym I have noticed that when you register
A	mm
B	a picture of you comes up and your details I don't know whether I like that
A	well yes but it's the same when you go to Virgin and when it was a
B	but that's only for the
A	your picture's for them to see isn't it?
B	for the staff to see
A	oh
B	yeah this is like as you walk up the stairs you could look at the screen and I could see
A	oh
B	we've just booked in if I'd got my glasses on
A	oh what sort of details?
B	date of birth and everything
A	oh really? oh no I wouldn't be happy with that
B	no so when they register I'm gonna I'm gonna take my glasses next time I go and I'm gonna look and if there's information on there I don't like like address and date of birth I'm gonna ask for it to be
B	until the next person books in
A	oh really?
A	that's not a very good system
B	er particularly when
A	yeah no
B	so there are
A	you should have a word with
B	yes I'm gonna have a word
A	but all of the security and the implications aside it's a bit of a pain for us because if you remember
B	oh does she?
B	so he gets like forty pound a month from his?
A	from his granny for for his lunch
B	she's so lovely isn't she?
A	she is she is when you've got eight grandchildren it's a lot
B	is she out of hospital now? is everything alright?
A	yes she came out on erm
B	oh good good
A	Friday yes so but but from our point of view I'm not sure how that's gonna work unless we just give her their bank details and say well keep giving it to them and then they can have their cards registered cos they've got little current accounts
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	and then because if I if it's coming off my
B	dinner money
A	like
B	well
A	well
B	yeah
A	he might buy himself something at break and have his sandwiches and then he won't be so starving
B	like today
A	on a Monday with his referee course but so it's a
B	yeah well if they want the forms back by Wednesday I'd better sit and read it properly I know
A	all the all the form was cos I sent it back with
B	cos
A	oh okay
A	mm
B	good point
A	well
B	well I still haven't got round and I was going to do it this morning and I haven't I still think it is wrong that we should be paying for the boys to go to and from school
A	oh I know
B	because it's compulsory education
A	I know education I know but who are you gonna write to? the council? the the the
B	well initially I'd phone the lady up
A	the the in the transport department
B	our contact
B	yeah
A	yeah
A	yeah you can yeah
A	erm
B	erm and say I know we're a couple of months in and it's just you know what it's like you always think you're gonna do it the next day
A	yeah
B	but I just think it's wrong that they should have to pay
B	because it is compulsory I can understand if they choose to stop on
A	to stop on in the sixth form
B	then that's different
A	yeah
B	but it's compulsory education and down the road she gets her money back she
A	who does?
A	oh does she?
B	claims gets the money back for her boys going to college
A	how?
B	well
A	is that just because they're a low income family?
B	well I don't know are they? he's on a fairly good pension I believe so I don't know if they are
A	did they used to get free dinners? no?
B	not that I'm aware of
B	yeah
A	have you not asked her how she claimed it back?
B	no I need to ask her
A	you do really
B	because I remember hearing her her phone rang and sometimes I just work the walk the length of the church if we come out the same time
A	yeah
B	and erm I heard her say but yeah it's a lot of money isn't it? transport there and back every day blah blah blah blah
A	where do they get the bus to? where's the college
B	well I think they get the bus to
A	right
B	or
A	yeah
B	and then they get picked up by the college bus from
A	oh okay okay
B	but to and from
A	well it's one pound twenty same as we pay cos it's the standard
B	yeah but I think she's claiming it back she gets it reimbursed
A	well you do need to find out how then
B	I do
B	it's a lot of money
A	fifty quid a month
B	I know
A	I give the money to
B	I
A	or he uses
B	yeah
B	yeah every weekend I give
A	coins and me and ten twenty Ps
B	yeah
A	and then I don't get it back
B	and it goes in his pocket
A	when he
B	no neither do I
A	and I know I know
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	and I'll say that's one pound twenty please
A	and he'll say yeah mum and that's that
B	oh but erm talking about attitudes and things like that erm was telling me
B	that erm apparently some of the things that erm
B	yeah
A	all the names get blanked out
B	oh
A	the whole lot
B	erm yeah
A	really?
A	really?
B	and says she said
A	well why is he allowed to get away with it?
B	I don't know
A	that's terrible
B	she never told me what but she said it is dreadful
A	well I have heard little things I mean I know
B	oh yeah yeah
A	from from they always have the parents' evening in the same corridors don't they?
B	yeah
A	but he'd said about oh well if my mum was on the stairs nobody else'd be able to fit in type of thing which is very mean
B	mean?
B	I was gonna say then but true
A	true I know but
B	but yeah
A	I know but if you start hearing your own family
B	but she's not that big is she?
A	no she's not

B	if you really want to come and you can't purely because of that just bring the girls with you
A	mm

A	no
B	er
A	gosh did she say did she give a maximum number? or not?
B	well she'd said the JCB was fifty ladies
A	she did and she said that was too many didn't she?
B	too many
B	well we've got twenty-two
A	and
B	possibly twenty-six if
A	mm
B	erm and then if
A	oh yeah yeah
B	so that'll be twenty
A	yeah
B	which is just nice
A	which is a nice number yeah
B	so
A	mm

A	about it and not gone
B	when we meet up for coffee she hasn't got back to me yet
A	I don't need to buy anything though

B	erm no I don't really need to buy anything but er I will buy something I need to buy actually secret Santa for dinner ladies
A	oh okay
B	so I'm gonna buy some of them gloves
A	mm
A	yeah
B	I'm gonna buy a pair of them erm
A	that's a good idea
B	yeah
A	actually
B	oh he could get that from there
A	yeah well it depends if it's a man or a woman
B	is this
A	and then I went out and bought obviously
B	is he enjoying his job?
A	er yes he is he is erm
B	mm
A	it's just all the driving really
B	mm
A	that he doesn't like and he doesn't like staying away from home much but he his enjoying the job
B	mm
A	yeah I don't know how long he'll stay he was talking about in the spring looking for something else just for those reasons the driving and stopping away from home but one of the other senior management team has left recently and the chairman not the chairman the chief exec whoever
B	the man who was employed the same time as
A	yes
B	yeah
A	the Scottish man yes er has been
B	oh right
A	so he doesn't want them to be leaving so he was trying to sound
B	mm
A	to try and keep you there so
B	but do they want an investment in return?
A	I don't think they did I think it was
B	no
A	just gonna be a you know an issue of shares
B	right
A	for him
B	yeah
A	er I I don't really know I mean it's not happened yet but
B	so are the family thinking of selling then? when you say floating are the family thinking of selling?
A	no I don't think they're selling I think it's just a way of of raising some extra money to do some more erm renovation works I think
B	mm
A	I don't really know I don't think they're they're ever gonna sell it as such just float it on the
B	right
A	stock exchange but they would still have the majority of the shareholdings I think I don't know so it was one of those whereby you could
B	mm
A	and also dangle a carrot because he's basing all of his strategy on having a stable senior management team
B	yeah
A	and of course
B	yeah
A	operations manager so anyway we'll see
B	yeah
A	but it is it's just the driving he's done a lot done about a hundred thousand miles on that car and it's not three years old yet
B	mm
A	it's a very good car though
B	I was gonna say it's a good car though it'll
A	very reliable
B	yeah
A	it's been I mean it was serviced again on Friday and it didn't need anything doing to it
B	no
A	I mean it has its oil changed and it it has new tyres and that's been about it
B	and if you think the majority majority is motorway anyway which is
A	yeah
B	good for the car
A	yeah
B	isn't it?
A	yeah that's true
B	you know like it might be clocking the mileage up but
A	yeah
B	in the way of engine damage or that
A	yes yeah
B	you're not gear changing every couple of minutes are you?
A	no not unless he's stuck in traffic or when he gets to
B	mm
B	stuck behind a tractor
A	yeah but no he is still enjoying it so that's good that's good
B	so you know what you should do for the week as
A	I know he is look at him
B	he's there with his cheeky smile
A	with that lovely smile
A	and nice I'm happy to look at him when he's like that
B	I can't imagine him being any different
A	really? yes
A	you wanna live with him
B	does he have any like er like er
B	no
A	he just gets he just he just irritates other people like if he's
B	oh does he? yeah
A	that's what he does but he doesn't necessarily strop or slam doors or
B	no no I haven't had any of that
A	but they do have they do have fights
B	do they?
A	sometimes that get can get a bit physical
B	really?
B	oh
B	yeah
A	to be dragging them apart
B	yeah yeah
A	they're both a lot bigger than me
B	I'd shut the door and leave em to it if I was you
A	I do sometimes it's just I don't like to listen to it you know?
B	on the understanding if there's any damage then they pay for it
A	yeah
B	if they can't control their
A	and they clean up their own blood no
B	tempers
A	there's been no blood
B	not yet
A	but er it's not often but you know sometimes I do think god
A	I know you you've got like your finger on the pulse
B	I tell you popular me
A	you are
B	oh it's I think it's
B	no
A	are you enjoying your new phone?
B	don't know who it is I do I like it I don't use half the things that are on there still only text receive why is it saying
