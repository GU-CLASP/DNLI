C	yes
B	but then it depends cos it just like you say it depends on the weather
C	it depends on the weather as to where you go really
B	I'm just wondering  I'm just wondering  if by Saturday if I'm up in the clouds in my helicopter I'll be able to see see far afield and see if there's any snow in different areas
C	yes of course
B	I'll be
D	mrs
C	A bindery okay doke

B	A bit
D	to the pub and back
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B doesn't walk a lot.	Entailment
D	I remember you telling me about it
D	oh right yeah
B	that's what it's called
D	there's two excellent pubs in that part of the world too
B	well we down at the bottom there was I don't know whether it's called the there's a tiny one em
D	yeah I think that's the one we've we've stayed at
B	yeah yeah yeah
D	or whichever one it was
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker D knows a couple of great pubs.	Entailment
B	yeah

B	twentieth
D	oh right the roller
B	on the twentieth
[ANNOTATION]	There are many mosquitos in the lakes.	Neutral
D	superb pub at the bottom
B	A what?
D	superb pub at the bottom
B	right another pub
D	yeah and and then a little railway line that winds its way up into the hills it's lovely
B	tell me what these
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker D mentions an awful pub located at the bottom.	Contradiction
D	the the one at
B	they're called the Boot and the
D	the the one actually at Ravenglass is the Ratty or something like that
B	is that  Is that Is that  dead obvious where the
D	oh you can't miss is you can't
B	it's very small isn't that
D	it's kind of its stuck on its own and you can't possibly miss is because it's right by the side of the the proper railway right? And then you have to walk a little way up to the the
[ANNOTATION]	Ravenglass is a small town.	Neutral
B	boot?
D	is the name of the village
B	oh right yeah okay
D	and there's three pubs there all of which are excellent
B	right
D	I've been to all three of them
B	right
D	tested and
B	excellent
D	blimey
B	no it's a cheap one give over
D	yeah cos normally you only do one night
B	only
D	ah I see
B	and the
D	that's not bad at all
B	not bad at all
D	I know one place cheaper than that and that's only because I get discount being a
B	yeah?
D	but you get a discount there for your  But that brings the price down for a double room bed and breakfast thirty-six quid
B	for two of you?
D	what? That's it's room price
B	yeah that's very good
D	so
B	is it a long way to it to walk?
D	what
B	could you walk to it
D	eh I I
D	investigate
B	you know what I mean? Yeah
D	Cos I can't remember what the distance is between the two
B	Arnside
D	right but Ravenglass if further round the side
B	yeah cos it would be nice just to have a really good just a good day out you know be it part walking drive maybe I bet we have to drive I don't know but
D	yeah yeah yeah
B	yeah
D	and it's it's worth having a look at places like
B	ah
D	again
B	yeah it's a case of looking at maps
D	well your nearest public library has got all those
B	oh
D	where do you live?

C	ah yes yes
D	we were talking about walking in the Dales
C	we were talking yeah walking walking somewhere

D	that'll be good
C	yes
D	well I
C	yeah no I agree
D	so if you go to France and Germany and Austria and places like that like and you say sorry I don't eat meat and they look at you like you've got a third arm

D	you don't what? You don't eat meat? Is there something wrong with you
C	you don't eat meat
D	it is well there's no  there's no  em there's no big deal about not eating meat there
C	yeah I suppose it is really yeah
D	especially Switzerland where they charge you an arm and a leg
C	oh Switzerland is mega expensive yes yeah
D	it's a real rip off and they take the money off you left right and centre and you don't get very much in return from what I've found in eh in Switzerland so
C	well it's always they're always a bit grumpy as well there as well I find
D	Grumpy
C	that's what I've noticed
D	probably cos you weren't spending money at the time
C	yeah that's it
D	it's not the point
C	that'll explain why they were grumpy with me
C	no I didn't
D	no please please they've had them at least since the late nineteen sixties
