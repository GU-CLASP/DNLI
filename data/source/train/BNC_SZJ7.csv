B	we've never had that before
A	we've never had the feedback before
C	from?
A	the people that er look after the hostel you know the the parent hostel weren't it?
B	mm
C	was it good?
A	fantastic
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	really chuffed
C	so what did they say?
B	said the paperwork was excellent the the
A	was excellent
B	yeah
C	so the people must write then? so the do the people make comments?
B	no that was just her
A	it's er
B	she's
A	the parent hostel they come up and inspect you every now and then they they look at you and talk to you and what have you

B	mm but they
A	her husband lived there all the time
B	mm but he goes to work as well though yeah
A	so they they knew what we were up to anyway
C	right
A	you know
B	so although we were we were totally on our own doing it erm but they came back in the evening so they
C	yeah
A	talk to people
B	and then erm when they do all the cashing up and the cos they do all the take the money away and check the paperwork
C	yeah
B	is correct and things like that at the end so yeah
B	it's just nice to have
C	it's nice to get that feedback though isn't it?
A	yeah

B	mm
A	yeah
C	oh that's brilliant that is
A	that is we were so pleased
B	yeah kind of makes it worth doing you know
C	mm

B	yeah
A	got them into the health centre
A	yeah anyhow they went straight there like I think they were
B	mm we thought there might've been feedback from them that's what we thought
B	when we saw er
C	cos you did ask for feedback didn't you? you asked if you could you could er?
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	let
B	yeah
A	and then when er the parent hostel people were there
B	yeah the we er we were the first people she actually
A	well we were I started talking to her and
B	she was very
A	playing with her and and she was she was about that high over the desk you see
C	yeah

C	yeah
A	and she she got really excited
B	it was only the last day though wasn't it?

C	yeah
A	oh yeah it'll be January won't it?
C	yeah
B	mm
C	January time
A	yeah I was thinking
C	yeah
A	yeah fifteen
B	mm
A	fifteen
C	where
B	yeah
A	I don't know where it's gone
B	mm
A	but every time that go quicker and quicker that's the trouble
B	mm
C	oh I just find it amazing really
A	yeah?
C	I find it that it's been ten years since I went to America
A	ten years?
B	yeah
A	that was with
B	mm
A	ten years
B	yeah it's strange when you start looking back isn't it?
[ANNOTATION]	ten years have passed since visiting America	Entailment
A	that's scary
B	mm
A	scary when you start looking back
C	it is
B	mm
A	well nothing nothing much has changed
C	nothing has changed so
A	still you'll be alright Saturday
C	why
A	you've hit the jackpot
B	mm
A	that's my prediction
[ANNOTATION]	scary when you look forward	Neutral
C	that's your prediction
A	what? and get some happy pills?
C	no I won't take any of those will I? so
B	yeah
A	well what's he gotta do for you then?
C	I dunno really erm
[ANNOTATION]	will not take happy pills	Entailment
B	get you on the list
C	get me on the list for
A	oh that'd be handy
B	mm
C	but I can't er you know I can't do anything with that though can I?
A	no
C	cos
[ANNOTATION]	wants to get on a list	Entailment
A	yeah
B	mm
C	didn't know he was in
B	yeah yeah
A	yeah
B	he when was it? Saturday?
A	Saturday he went in
[ANNOTATION]	he worked when he was in	Neutral
B	mm
A	and er prostate same problem as he had eight years ago
C	right
A	so I think it's been drilled out again
C	so furring up?
A	yeah
B	mm
[ANNOTATION]	five years ago he had a prostate problem	Contradiction
A	so er he can't work for another three months
B	oh is it?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	he's not to do anything
B	yeah
A	he's really uncomfortable
C	god
B	mm
A	really uncomfortable
B	mm
A	but he's alright in hisself
C	yeah
A	you know what
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	he bounces about anyway don't he?
C	do they have to grow it?
A	I don't know what they have to do with it
C	it shouldn't take that long to get the results from a biopsy
A	well I shouldn't've thought so but
C	yeah
A	I mean he's gotta
C	yeah
A	and er but he can't do any work no work at all
B	mm no mm
A	I said to her this morning cos she phoned up you
B	yeah
A	not this morning is it? this afternoon she phoned up and er
C	tell you what to do
A	she laughs
B	yeah
A	I said to her give him a big kiss from me he said she said well do you want to make him sick?
B	yeah
C	there must be something that's causing it
A	well when I was a kid yonks ago
C	too much calcium? what? creating calcium?
A	yeah and it creates these these er crystals in your bladder and that becomes really hard to go to the loo
C	yeah
A	that's what happened
C	yeah but but
A	and and that's all down to your
C	able to filter it out and
A	filter it out properly
C	cos you need calcium for your strength of your bones and everything else
A	you do yeah yeah
C	kind of wonder if it's anything he worked with a long long time ago that's causing it
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	oh there was no health and safety then was there?
C	yeah and what I what I worked with even thirty thirty years ago you can you can't work with that stuff now
A	no no you can't
B	no
A	but a few years only a few years ago if you changed your wheel changed the and put new brake pads or
C	mm
A	and you could actually smell it when you blew them out
C	yeah
A	cleaned them out
B	mm
A	that all went in didn't it?
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	but when
A	we used to have tins of
C	yeah the green stuff yeah
A	to clean your hands up
C	yeah
A	and that used to get all the grease and oil off off your hands didn't it?
C	yeah
A	but that was carcinogenic
C	well it had something like a benzene ring in it or something
A	yeah
B	mm
C	you know I was thinking about
A	I know terrible
C	you know I looked in our
B	mm
C	in our chemical
A	no
B	mm
C	can't keep it
A	no
C	can't keep it
A	no
C	can't have that can't have the other
A	well
B	yeah
A	at school we were we used to make gunpowder
C	yeah
A	with saltpetre
B	yeah
A	and we made that at school
B	yeah
A	so what did we do when we were kids? we went up the chemist and you could buy the stuff
C	yeah
A	you could buy the saltpetre you could buy the sulphur and you could buy the carbon or you could make the carbon but you could get it all from the chemist
B	mm yeah
C	straight through
C	we used to make we used to make
B	mm
C	fireworks in the classroom the chemistry teacher did
A	yeah?
C	and let them go across
A	yeah
B	mm
A	iron filings was er
C	yeah
A	was er
A	sprinkle iron filings over your Bunsen burner and wahey
C	sparks and everything didn't it?
C	yeah
B	mm
A	can't do that anymore
C	no we we had things like sodium I think sodium chlorate and when we had this new technician come in
A	cor
C	or sodium chlorate calcium chlorate and he goes what are you doing? and he goes I'm just doing this he went do you realise the army won't use that cos it's so unstable?
C	cos it's like a detonator
A	yeah
B	mm
C	and it was a substance which was so unstable
A	yeah
C	and what he was doing with it he was like oh okay
A	well they er we used to have sheets of magnesium
C	yeah
A	and set
C	yeah
A	that used to burn and burn and burn didn't it? wow
C	yeah
A	that was brilliant
C	yeah
A	that was
C	yeah you could just burn it in you know you used to get a
A	yeah
C	lots of different things like that but no
A	we used to put it in er well our teacher used to put it in a treacle tin and hammer the treacle tin down and of course it
C	yeah
A	blow the treacle the thing off
C	yeah Coffee-Mate's a good one
A	yeah? does it?
C	Coffee-Mate is absolutely brilliant Coffee-Mate
A	oh yeah cos that'll burn like
B	yeah
A	that'll burn like mad don't it?
C	yeah if you
A	yeah
C	put a candle in it
A	yeah
C	right? and you've got a means to puff air in it like that
A	yeah
C	so you put your Coffee-Mate in you light the
A	yeah
C	that catches fire and blows the lid off the top
C	cos that's how a combustion engine works
B	oh right
A	yeah
B	mm
A	I tell you that the experiment they done on the television
B	mm
A	just just the other day with er custard was it? not custard erm
B	cornflour?
C	cornflour?
A	cornflour
B	mm
A	did it with cornflour they had a
C	yeah
A	pressure air gun and they blew the cornflour over the Bunsen burner and that went poof
C	yeah same type of thing yeah
B	mm
C	cos that's what Coffee-Mate is in some respects isn't it?
B	yeah
A	well it is ain't it? yeah
C	a type of dry flour cornflour
A	cornflour and and dried milk and stuff like that yeah
C	yeah
B	mm
C	with a with a bit of sugar in to give it a bit of flavouring
A	but er I mean dust in itself is pretty dangerous
C	yeah
A	because I remember in silos it was a few years ago when they used to pump the er barley and and what have you that used to create dust and they used to have dust explosions
C	yeah
A	in the silos
C	yeah yeah
A	so when er I expect they have something different now to do it
A	yeah
C	so you don't get a spark or something but no it's some of the things you did
A	make lead?
C	yeah
A	did you? yeah
B	mm
C	used to have you used to have lead oxide
A	oh right yeah
C	and there was different
A	we used to do it with copper
C	and you get a carbon block
A	yeah
C	you'd get a blow torch Bunsen burner and you'd blow so you're adding heat to the thing
A	yeah
C	and you'd get little lumps of lead
A	cor right yeah
B	mm
C	yeah
A	ran out yeah well
B	mm
A	and that they used to have that er blue
C	copper sulphate
A	copper sulphate that's right and er you could you could make
C	crystals out of it
A	crystals out of that yeah
B	yeah
C	one of the things was how many worms could you get up in an area?
A	yeah
C	and you'd have three different solution you'd have water
A	yeah
C	you'd have
A	oh right
C	which if you got
A	no you couldn't do anything like that now
B	mm
C	and you used to get crystal potassium permanganate and you'd show how diffusion in water and things like that just one crystal you drop this piece of potassium permanganate in and you'd watch it
A	grow
C	not
A	oh I see right
C	and go in the water
A	yeah
C	so it like diffusion
A	cos we used to grow crystals too didn't we?
C	yeah yeah er in silica that was the way you did
A	yeah
A	yeah
C	and they'd grow then look at them
A	we used to leave them leave them there for about a week and what have you and you'd look at them every day and they'd all different wonderful shapes
C	yeah
A	they used to grow these crystals didn't they?
C	you can buy kits that do that now
A	I suppose you can yeah
B	mm
A	but they're all safe
C	yeah
C	nothing
B	mm
A	that was that's weird how the how times change though cos
C	yeah still have that
A	you still have that do you?
B	mm
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	mm still have them
A	and then
C	it's just how you set the room up
A	yeah
C	oh yeah
A	and and they had they had a
A	yeah in the metal work where they had the forge they had two forges
C	yeah
A	have you
C	can't have them
A	you can't have forges?
C	you don't
A	that's how
B	mm
A	learned his trade
B	mm
A	I mean he made this these pokers where are they?
C	on the side
B	they're there
A	are they?
B	this side
C	er the one here?
B	mm yeah
A	which one is it? there's one here and then there's er there's one in the other room
C	yeah
A	he made all of that and there's another one the poker one this is
B	think so yeah
A	yeah
C	yeah you
C	you can't do stuff like that now
A	you can't do it now
C	I mean the reason being is because they're trying to do away with it
A	mm yeah
C	in in the old building
A	yeah yeah
C	that type of thing with a hood that came out
A	that's right yeah
C	and then we had a refurb and then we went to a ceramic one
A	oh right
C	so you had ceramic er gas ceramic ones
A	yeah
C	and that was alright it did but you had a little core in and the gas came round and it went through and that was that was alright
A	yeah
C	erm and then you had a couple of
A	ah
C	so what they what the governments do is they take stuff off
A	yeah
C	therefore you don't need it
A	that's right
B	mm
C	and then your head teacher or whatever gets some idea
A	mm
C	won't support it
A	mm
C	so it disappears
A	yeah
C	it's like it's like
B	yeah
A	it's all these skills that that's how they've all died out though ain't it? all the skills
B	mm mm
A	I mean they're crying out for old skills again aren't they?
B	yeah
C	I mean that's
A	yeah
C	but the kids the the thing with that now is
A	they wouldn't would they? no
C	they wouldn't they wouldn't sit and I think the way that one that one is made
[ANNOTATION]	No one is interested in old skills	Contradiction
A	mm
C	so you cut the top into squares and you pull it out
A	yeah
C	you extend it out and then you twist it round
A	yeah
B	mm
C	but they just
A	and then you have to
C	yeah
A	and the
C	where you know it's not that it's not I mean it is
A	mm
B	mm
A	we've got another one in the other room that
B	yeah mm
A	that was a poker
[ANNOTATION]	You cut the top into triangles	Contradiction
B	yeah
C	yeah well I could do a bit of it
[ANNOTATION]	There are those who are asking for people with old skills	Entailment
A	yeah
C	I can't do any er you know been a long time
A	yeah well we we had everything in that school we had we had the forge and we had the anvils we had the lot
C	mm we've got we've got we've got er a
A	yeah
C	a big one I had to use that the other week for the first time
A	is it a big old Herbert is it?
C	yeah
A	that's a Herbert the have they still got that
C	I think it I think it is but it's a it's a big one
[ANNOTATION]	A is working as a smith	Neutral
A	yeah?
C	erm
A	yeah that's right
C	to move it
A	yeah
C	where usually it's on
A	to engage it
[ANNOTATION]	C is attending a school for smithers	Neutral
A	yeah yeah
C	this was actually on the on the thread on the saddle
A	that's right yeah
C	er because I had to cos I when I did my safety course I had to prove that I could do the set the tool
A	yeah
A	yeah
C	I had to centre drill
A	yeah
C	take some out the centre face off and then turned out
C	and then
A	that was my first test after I got a a job whether I could make a face plate for a chuck
C	right
A	and the
C	mm
A	the lot you know gotta fit in properly to within one half of a thou otherwise the chuck was all like this
C	mm
A	yeah
C	I know
B	mm
C	but it all depends on how what you wanna do
A	yeah yeah
C	you know they someone is gonna do some bowl
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	the only trouble I had with lathes
B	mm
A	is they're alright-handed
C	mm
A	so I'm working like that whereas you're supposed to work like that
C	yeah
A	and I work like that you see but that worked out
C	yeah that I had to do the I had to do the wood turning one as well
A	yeah?
C	I quite like wood turning it's quite easy
A	yeah
C	erm totally different to
A	oh it's totally different to metal turning
C	you know it's more feel or whatever
A	yeah
C	but you had to you had to set up a
C	and it's quite funny cos the guy said we were turning between centres and he goes well you put a cross here and you put a cross there he says and then you line it up on the tail stop
C	and he looked and said that's a rotating centre on the tail stop
A	on the tail stop yeah
C	oh right I says I said then you have then you have the fish tail at the front
A	yeah
C	and he goes yeah he says and you just he says and then you he says you just marry it up I said don't you centre punch it?
C	he went what? and this is the guy giving the training
A	yeah
B	mm
C	and I went well if you centre punch the two ends of your piece of material
A	you know where you
C	you know where your centre is roughly
C	and you can line it up on the pin at the front
A	yeah
C	and then on the tail stop
A	yeah
C	I said and then if you put a cut in across the diagonal with a tenon saw
A	yeah
C	I said it lines up
A	yeah
C	he said oh I've never seen that before that's good ain't it?
B	mm
A	yeah
A	lots of different things yeah there there's so many short shortcuts when when I was an apprentice they asked we used to have to make these er bearing housings for saw benches
A	because of my jig that I'd made up my my special tool that I'd made
C	special tool you made
A	which I had to hide up every night
C	yeah
A	but we we were making a lot of money
C	can't do it now
A	god you couldn't do anything like that now no
C	no it's just totally different now
B	mm
A	but I mean we used to have the time and motion study
C	yeah
B	mm
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	and that was it
C	yeah yeah erm
A	you've gotta look like you're doing you know what you're doing you have yeah
B	mm
A	but then you make a
C	yeah
A	then your Vernier and getting that right that take a long while but when you've gotta tool that that does it
C	mm
A	yeah
B	mm
A	only take a bit of thinking
C	yeah
A	at
C	mm
A	oxygenating oxygenating the water and then returning it back to where to be recycled you see
C	recycle
A	and they just used to pump it over over the shingle which bounced it about
C	mm
A	oxygenated it and back in it went and and they made a lot of money out of that
C	there's always I mean there's there's always ways to do things I mean I remember
A	well
C	and it you know it was like
A	mm
C	we'll get it sorted you know we'll get it sorted not a problem and I er
B	mm
C	and I used to label it one two three when they came in so that the same piece of equipment
A	yeah
B	mm
C	it was like you
C	and some staff
A	did they?
A	yeah
C	and
A	yeah
C	so by eleven o'clock
A	yeah
C	and then you would be tidying up what you needed
A	yeah
C	and it would be like oh can we can we have this? and you'd
C	so you always
B	mm
C	you always found a way round
A	yeah
C	and then they brought this rule in that they were closed and that they were closing at Christmas so Christmas holidays closing
A	yeah
C	and you had to take your annual leave
A	well
C	and the argument was well I don't wanna take it at Christmas
A	no
C	I don't wanna take it at Christmas
A	you want it in the summer time
B	mm
C	I want it in the summer
A	yeah
C	or I want it at Easter or you know
A	yeah
B	mm
C	and when you've only got twenty days at that point in time
A	yeah
C	which you didn't have the same holidays as teachers you know erm well I would like a couple of days here and a couple of days there and and I why should I take it in the at Christmas?
A	yeah
C	I don't want to take it at Christmas I'll have my Christmas days off but I won't take it I said well what about if we worked overtime? don't get paid for it but we it allows us to have the Christmas period off
A	yeah
C	and it was like well will you be able to do it in that period of time?
C	so we
A	yeah
C	we
A	yeah
C	so
A	yeah
C	you know
A	yeah
C	so you're looking at what?
A	yeah
C	you don't need to do many weeks
B	mm
C	leading up to Christmas to get that time off
B	mm
A	no that's right yeah
C	and sometimes it'd be a little bit later and you know everything everything was done wasn't wasn't a problem come Christmas period have all the time off
A	yeah
C	and still have your Christmas and still have your normal holiday time and it was like yeah and you know like you say like time and motion you can take a long time doing something if you're being watched because you need to but if you need to get it done you can
B	mm
A	you can get it done in half the time
C	you can get it done in half the time
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	it's like it's like the summer holidays they used to say right you've got you know literally you have to do a spring clean on every
A	yeah
C	okay? don't have a classroom each with your three
A	oh right
C	because I could buy test tubes that were quite cheap
A	yeah
C	so I used to buy really
A	yeah
C	and then for the real
A	yeah?
C	Pyrex ones you washed
A	yeah
C	and you had a you kept a bucket with this stuff in erm and you used to leave them to soak and you'd
A	no
C	which a lot of places have now but you just let them soak over the weekend in a sink of hot water come in on a Monday morning undo the sink swill them all out nice and
B	mm
C	absolutely nice so the summer holidays they'd start okay
A	yeah
C	oh they were horrendous
C	so then you have to get rid of all the junk out of that so the flows would run and everything you couldn't do that
A	things used to go down the sink in the in the science lab then
C	yeah yeah
A	down the sink and into the
C	yeah
B	mm
A	sewage system
