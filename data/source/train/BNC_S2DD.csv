A	yeah the one that says like speaker one who speaks first
C	yeah
A	who speaks second and then you have to list all the topics that are covered as well
C	yeah
D	so what you really should do is when you do a recording
A	it's easiest to just do it as you do it

A	yeah you know like you by tagliatelle in dried balls?
B	mm
A	it was like that
C	got a funny story
B	help yourself
C	can't remember what
A	you help yourself to this
C	I was I think I I was making some kind of pasta I can't remember what and erm I bought a mum had bought me that tagliatelle from like Tesco
A	dried stuff?
C	and I took yeah I took it out the packet and put it on my table and miss was coming down round and writing down
B	what you'd done
C	what everything was
D	no I
A	go on
B	sorry
C	and
A	did you tell you her you'd made your own pasta?
C	I was like I had this this
A	no wonder it was dried in
C	no but I took it out the packet
A	yeah but
B	if it's dried you'd be able to tell the difference
A	if it's dried you wouldn't make the fresh pasta and then dry it if you've
C	well
A	made your own pasta
C	well
C	yeah
D	a bit sharpish
A	was she not laughing at you?
C	no
A	Mrs

C	but like oh it was so funny
B	yeah but they should instruct you shouldn't they?
A	food was the
B	yeah but do you know what we used to do?
A	it's impossible
B	she'd demonstrate one week and the next week you'd do it
A	mm to be fair that's what Mrs
D	then what do you do in an exam for food tech?
C	oh god it's like
A	food groups
C	yeah a lot it's common sense
A	nutrition
C	well then there's like spazzy questions or like like micronutrients were on this year which
D	mm
C	that's a bit of a disadvantage then
A	it's okay mum you've not had any of this
B	ah well
A	have some beef
B	is it fatty?
A	mm yeah there's quite a bit of fat that piece is okay
B	mm you could have just done with more meat
A	mm
C	can you
A	and then it kind of mixed in a bit
A	yeah
B	but I've never tasted gnocchi that I've enjoyed before and that's nice
A	see that's very nice but it's so rich
B	mm
A	go on
B	mm
A	yeah
B	I think you'd have to cos you'd have to er get a razor blade or something to slice those wouldn't you?
A	uhu
B	unless you used like a peeler
A	a don't I don't think a peeler would do it that thin
C	unless you like grate it over the top you know like a cheese grater?
A	mm
B	you you'd lose it though wouldn't you?
A	I'm sure you can buy at home like a truffle
B	slicer
A	slicer
C	even so just go on Amazon there'll be one on there won't there?
A	red sky at night

B	I don't know I guess so
A	I don't think they would fly this high like if it was just from them there would they?
C	be a waste of
D	but swallows do kind of fly like that really yeah
C	yeah but it would be a waste of energy wouldn't it? there's no reason to get this

B	I did last night
A	were they good?
B	well it was clear last night cos you know it was a bit colder last night
A	yeah it was very cold last night
B	erm
C	the thing is there's space for it isn't there to put it in that like the
A	there is space for it
C	part
A	but I guess it's cost isn't it for a holiday rental
B	and managing it as well
A	yeah
B	I suppose a pool's enough as well
A	a pool's expensive enough to keep on top of isn't it?
B	yeah
D	better get in it and use it then hadn't you?
B	we have
A	well we have done you haven't
D	I know I saw someone being thrown in and screaming
B	all three of us have been in
C	you've just slept
A	there's only you who hasn't been in
D	I only had a quick
C	a quick nap
D	a quick nap I dunno it's fine
A	a quick nap you were sleeping for about two hours
D	don't know if was that long but whatever ooh
B	oh
A	ooh
D	crap that was close
A	he scraped himself then didn't he?
C	no
B	I thought he got
D	almost
B	the wheel
A	that was so close I would not risk that
B	I would not wouldn't wanna bring my
A	no
B	BMW up there
A	don't risk
D	you're always
A	your Audi
D	he obviously knows what he's doing
A	you wouldn't have made that on
B	mm I wouldn't have tried
A	mm
B	he's obviously used to doing it
A	mm yours was very nice I'd have had a smaller amount with some veg
D	did you bring the did you bring the anti-bite cream I'm just getting bitten
A	you have it's in the erm not not not the repellent you've brought the itchy stuff
C	I'm just thinking right what what's the difference between Ebola mosquito and a normal mosquito? is it just a different like species of mosquito?
A	I think some of them carry the disease like they have the infection themselves
D	yeah yeah they have
C	so could we have Ebola mosquitoes over here?
A	oh he's
B	they said they were coming to Europe
A	is er is Ebola carried by carried by mosquitos?
C	it is isn't it?
D	yeah
B	yeah
A	could we not
D	erm well no not quite actually
A	is there somewhere that we couldn't like completely like eradicate mosquitos?
C	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Ebola is a very common disease	Neutral
D	I think there is
A	like having mass gassing?
C	can I just say this right
D	yeah
C	if
A	but would we not kill like everything else?
C	this was in my biology exam so I'm gonna have a little
A	go on
[ANNOTATION]	they are discusssing the possibility to eliminate all mosquitoes	Entailment
C	basically
D	right go on you first
C	they're doing it at the moment where you can genetically modify mosquitoes
A	okay so that the
C	so that like the
A	mm
C	die basically and they can't reproduce and you you can control the amount of
B	oh
[ANNOTATION]	it is impossible to modify the genetics of mosquitoes	Contradiction
C	like mosquitoes
A	that's clever
D	or become
C	so
D	infertile
B	so when the
C	yeah
B	when the when they hatch
C	so when
B	they won't live?
[ANNOTATION]	mosquitoes cannot become infertile	Contradiction
A	they're infertile yeah
C	yeah so that means if you release those into the wild they're gonna breed pass on those genes
A	and then it spreads in the populous
C	yeah
B	oh
A	and so they're doing that?
C	that's what that's what my biology exam said whether it's true or not I don't know
D	yes
A	are they starting to do that?
D	yes
[ANNOTATION]	they all study in university	Neutral
A	so how quickly would that start to work?
C	well that was one of the questions it was like why is this why is this bad? and I said cos it could lead to eradication of mosquitoes cos if you can't
A	I don't think mosquitoes do add anything to the food chain though do they? I suppose they
C	I wouldn't like stuff like frogs and
A	frogs things like that they might eat them but
A	yeah bit more then yeah it's alright
[ANNOTATION]	speaker c took a linguistics exam	Contradiction
D	you have to be careful kind of don't you altering the biodiversity
A	really?
D	yeah
A	what I wouldn't have thought a mosquito net would work as a fishing net cos they're not very strong it's just like
D	I know but
A	film
B	what's that
A	Bill Gates bought millions of mosquito nets took them to Africa and they've used them as fishing nets
B	take a duck to water
D	yeah not everywhere but yeah
A	isn't it take a horse to water?
A	a duck'd be
D	but they have eradicated polio most places now haven't they?
B	well it's make a comeback isn't it at some point
D	well
B	you know
D	well yeah in
