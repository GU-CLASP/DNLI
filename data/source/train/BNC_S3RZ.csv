A	are we going to do the coast to coast?
B	I'd love to do the coast to coast
A	you know
B	yeah
A	I wonder when that is?
B	yeah she's doing it for that company she works for
A	yeah
B	what is it? Camfed
A	no I don't think she works for Camfed does she? Or does she?
B	well I thought she did
A	oh
B	yeah
A	mm
B	maybe we could just go up
A	problem is dropping the car off at one end
B	well that's the problem isn't it
A	yeah
B	because the the places to stop on route have kind of monopolised it a little bit
A	mm
B	and they know you've got no other choice but to stay with them
A	yeah
B	if I could carry the tent as well
A	that's what we used to do
B	yeah but from one side of the country to the other
A	yeah it just depends injury wise
B	yeah it depends if my foot goes again
A	yeah
B	something I've always wanted to do
A	that doesn't take too long to climb does it
B	no no
A	you've got to get up there
B	or you know well we could go and do Snowdon or something
A	what of Scotland?
B	yeah
A	what the one that you love?
B	yeah
A	isle of Skye?
B	yeah
A	is it?
B	looks really beautiful there
A	do you get a ferry across?
B	no I think they've got a bridge
A	ah but I wouldn't be able to do all the driving all the way up there
B	yeah
A	that's impossible
B	yeah
A	yeah but then you need a car the other end as well
B	yeah
A	yeah probably
B	so how many emails did you sort out today?
A	there were two
B	mm
A	like Ben's email
B	er I did say
A	yeah?
B	yeah
A	we need to write them a nice
B	well there's a couple of people I didn't write back to
A	yes
B	right
A	yeah
B	yeah we're crap at staying in touch aren't we
A	yeah
B	yeah we both are
A	I think that's mainly because of my disorganisation and then my my thought processes are quite slow so it's like ah
B	yeah and you think too much of what you're going to write
A	I and then I wait a few days
B	yeah
A	and then  and then  I forget
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	person B is talking about football	Contradiction
A	and that's the same with with my other social networks as well
B	huh
A	ah look at those daffodils
B	yeah
A	beautiful
B	very yellow aren't they
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about color	Entailment
B	yeah
A	well they said
B	well they must be wild
A	no
B	but they come up don't they
A	yeah
B	yeah so if I had a garden I'd plant stuff that comes up every year
A	that's a hobby
B	yeah
A	yeah but if it's a hobby you don't notice it so much
B	yeah
A	I mean and if it's something that you do year after year then it just becomes this is what I do in in May
B	mm
A	or in
[ANNOTATION]	they are not sure which date goanna do that	Neutral
B	I'd just like them to come up every year
A	just buy buy them ready ready made
B	yeah
A	look at that fat waddling cat
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about a cat	Entailment
A	she's got some kittens in her oven
B	go and throw it in that wheelie bin
A	yeah they had the magazine come out and they're trying to get everybody to put those on there
B	yeah?
A	yeah because they're not there all the time
[ANNOTATION]	they are not sure about all time	Neutral
B	mm
A	and people get used to where it is and then they just start ignoring it if they drive past it every day
B	right
A	then you put them in a slightly different place which makes people look
B	yeah?
A	well
B	yeah
A	I'm starting to recognise a lot more flowers and things now since we've been learning a little bit about them
B	there's a stinging nettle
A	well done
B	there's a dandelion
A	well done
B	that's about the extent to my knowledge
A	oh
B	that's hedge and that's grass
A	what are you doing? You silly bugger
B	yeah it's still a bit chilly
A	yeah I know
B	and now it's beautiful
A	I was worried we'd get caught out in it again
B	no
A	huh
B	oh it's good to walk off the dinner
A	yeah
B	it was worth cooking that dinner just to see your mum's face
A	she has some funny faces
B	yeah
A	ah
B	well I mean I know it is it would have maybe one or two chillies
A	it was hot and you said hot? It's not hot
B	it
A	mm
B	quite surprised
A	thing with those kind of ones though with the little bit of pita bread and stuff if you haven't got something on the side
B	yeah you need the
A	I think you get hungry again a bit later because
B	yeah
A	oh look at that
B	has someone made that?
A	yeah
B	that's brilliant
A	ah a little piece of artwork
B	that's cool that is
A	well what animal would you say it is? I'd say it was a fox
B	A dragon
A	ah that's really good
B	no that's good yeah
A	now I'm going to have to look out for more pieces of wood made
B	yeah last night
A	mm
B	they should
A	mm
B	I wouldn't mind buying like an economics for dummies book or something
A	mm
B	look there's that private jet again
A	who lives in
B	that's the same one
A	yeah but
B	it's probably some general or something
A	oh
B	it's like that top secret plane that flies around with a big er antenna on the front of it just as it gets dark
A	ah they're testing something aren't they
B	yeah
A	hello pheasant
B	well
A	yeah what do you think they're testing for?
B	well it could be a reconnaissance of some kind of thing over the coast
A	I've heard of that name
B	yeah
A	where's she from?
B	she works for erm er oh what's? Bloody what are they called? JP Morgan
A	oh right
B	erm she's educated in like Canterbury and Oxford and now she's running like the whole of JP Morgan's commodity division
A	oh right
B	and she basically set up this credit default swap thing
A	what in the world? What in the what?
B	so well
A	can't have bought everything in the world?
B	no but
A	might have bought all the seeds
B	with all the trillions of dollars they've got
A	mm
B	because the bank owns all the goods they're acting as like a middleman
A	oh great
B	or something
A	but they can't
B	yeah but they can  they can  manipulate the prices of the food
A	oh
B	I don't know
A	I don't really understand what that would do
B	mm
A	it makes them more money? Or they control? I suppose oh I don't know whether they control everything
B	oh yeah of course
A	yeah
B	erm she's never given like an interview before she's
unknown_female	hello
A	hello
B	hello
A	oh she's a George Bush
B	but she was very clever in the way she came across
A	mm
B	when really she's extremely intelligent and you know quite evil
A	yeah
B	yeah I'm going to research it tonight anyway
A	yeah well that's the thing cos I like all all this stuff I don't have the arguments to
B	well that's it isn't it
A	I know that it's wrong but I can't explain in words what I feel about it or any back up
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	and I can approach it from a political or a social aspect and I can
A	do an A-Level in economics
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about politics	Entailment
B	no but I don't think that would be good enough
A	yeah you need  yeah you need  to go deeper
B	yeah I mean cos they're not going to teach you the stuff that you want to know anyway
A	but I was just thinking how you could
B	yeah
A	I thought they were plastic
B	what are they?
A	tulips
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about party	Contradiction
B	oh
B	well they're getting the sun look
A	they're beautiful
B	yeah
A	it's very
B	Cos even the universities teach you like how the system works but you can come out of university and still not be able to like critically view it
A	mm
B	or have an alternative
A	but yeah well like my
B	especially scientific things like that
[ANNOTATION]	they are not sure universities how teach	Neutral
A	yeah my research that I did for undergraduate
B	yeah
A	and then like that was how many years ago? And nobody had done it before
B	yeah
A	and I know the and and the lecturers were like oh don't be so stupid
B	yeah just go over ground that's all ready been
A	eye witness
B	yeah
A	this is all I know about
B	exactly
A	then it's on on the TV and they've made a whole program about it
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	they have made a program in TV	Neutral
A	but ah I just can't believe it
B	yeah
A	and Bob's your uncle
B	yeah yeah yeah
[ANNOTATION]	her uncle names is Bob	Entailment
A	some psychology graduate came out and then they  and then they  said on the news wow it's been found that that erm different words
B	yeah
A	and mine was flawed in many many ways really but it was the whole basis of the idea that hadn't been researched again
B	yeah but I mean subliminal messaging is quite a big topic
A	yeah yeah but it's not  it's not  fair
[ANNOTATION]	person A believe that is unfair	Neutral
B	and you go oh bloody I thought of that
A	yeah that happens all the time
B	you know that always happens
A	but you didn't do anything about it
B	yeah well that's the thing
A	I couldn't publish it cos I got seventy-four percent
B	oh you could have
A	well I was young
B	yeah yeah I know
A	especially when you've got the lecturer standing there going urgh
B	yeah
A	I mean they didn't help me one iota
B	yeah
A	Cos they weren't interested
B	that was kind of pushing for something new
A	yeah
B	whereas that isn't what a a degree's about
A	and and the the main thing is is the writing of it even if you
B	the main thing is making sure the literature review ties in with your like your whatever what are they called? And then you tie it with the conclusion
A	yeah you've really got to know how to write one
B	yeah yeah
A	I mean the manipulation of the data
B	yeah well that's what  that's what  I was surprised about with
A	just just make it a log value
B	yeah
A	just
B	mm
A	oh I've forgotten the name of them
B	yeah
A	oh we can't use that piece of data
B	oh yeah
A	even though it was somebody's opinion somewhere or it's something that happened somewhere
B	well exactly that's why all of these studies are a load of bollocks
A	they are
B	especially and especially when they're you know you've got these big companies which outsource a project to a like a research agency and they know
A	oh yeah
B	and the same applies to like government agencies or whoever
A	remember like part of our  part of our  masters was how can you manipulate this data?
B	yeah
A	and everybody came out with different ideas
B	have you got any mints?
A	everybody erm everybody
B	mm
A	and they came out all different directions but everybody who did a good job in writing it up and explaining what they did and why they did it got erm A's or whatever or if they did it well
B	yeah
A	oh that's enough of me moaning
B	yeah
A	I didn't mean to start moaning
B	Don't know
A	I don't mean too
B	oh
A	mm
B	thank you
A	no I don't mean to moan
B	apologising to me?
A	they do do some erm good research
B	mm mm mm
A	eat chocolate
B	yeah well that's done on purpose as well
A	yeah I know
B	well we could walk around the other block?
A	mm
B	I said we're going to wash up when we get back
A	yeah
B	mm
A	mm
B	yeah you do
A	well I'm going to practise with everybody every day
B	mhm
A	so that I get at least three games in a day
B	mm
A	they take longer than you think though don't they
B	mm
A	by the time you've done the three
B	well I noticed your
A	rounds
B	mm
A	A game
B	I've noticed your spinney shots are getting a lot better
A	yeah? I thought they were getting worse
B	no
A	it's my erm forehand
B	yeah
A	my back hand I'm getting better at doing all these different moves but my forehand I just can't seem to
B	yeah
A	yeah I know
B	yeah
A	this way
B	it's going to be a long walk
A	yeah
B	God
A	well I either get too excited or I get too frustrated cos I've done something silly
B	yeah
A	and that that annoys me because I know as I hit it that I've done it wrong
B	mm
A	and I think ah I should gave done hit it a different way
B	yeah
A	so really you can't  you can't  See I thinking too slowly and then do the wrong shot
B	yeah it's almost very kind of intuitive isn't it? Your movements and
A	mm
B	it's good for your reflexes
A	mm
B	yeah
A	mm
B	and they had  they had  a little section where all these kids were playing table tennis and they were just awesome
A	mm
B	and they were just pinging them back sort of like
A	yeah and erm
B	that's what I want to I don't know how to do that
A	do you know how fast we're going?
B	huh?
A	I think  I think  what you need to do is cos remember when I er there was a couple of shots two years ago Dad erm we did some recordings and we recorded us playing table tennis
B	yeah
A	and we recorded Dad and you playing table tennis
B	yeah look faster
A	it's not
B	when you're playing it seems slower cos your awareness is tuned in and your reactions
A	yeah yeah
B	yeah that's true
A	well that's what I've been trying to is step back to back from the table
B	you know and having proper like rallies like just smashing it to each other
A	mm
B	and then putting in a drop shot
A	yeah
B	oh yeah
A	those short shots
B	but I haven't got to the stage where I can just whack it from you know a couple of metres from the table
A	but in
B	yeah
A	Cos what they do those fast players
B	oh yeah
A	mm
B	which I'm getting there
A	mm
B	right on the base line
A	no
B	Cos then it's it's easy
A	too easy yeah
B	you want to be hitting it on the base line or or just dropping it over
A	mm
A	yeah for the like really work on the precision
B	yeah
A	oh he nodded
B	yeah he did nod
A	what a nice man
B	that was a proper farmers' nod
A	yeah it was wasn't it
B	Cos I I would
B	I mean cos the main thing is just playing for fun anyway but I would like to step it up a little bit and try and get to the next level
A	put some
B	yeah
A	well we weren't into table tennis then
B	yeah but they had table tennis clubs everywhere didn't they
A	yeah but we weren't into it
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	and in in the club was erm that woman who was on the Olympic team
A	really? In Hwamyeong-dong?
B	yeah
A	oh wow
B	and he became like excellent really quickly
A	oh you know Korea was such a great place for learning things
B	yeah it was good wasn't it
A	well I know  I know  there's
B	yeah
A	both of those
B	well it was kind of a booming country wasn't it
A	I hope
B	I mean everyone seemed to
A	everyone had to have that artistic side to them too so the kids had to study an instrument
B	yeah
A	that's like a major thing
B	yeah
A	no
B	and so they had
A	yeah well it wasn't extremely expensive like here either
B	no no
A	so the middle classes could afford it
B	yeah
A	oh yeah yeah
B	so they're going to gonna struggle
A	yeah it was
B	I mean you had the
A	it's one of those things that you look back on and go ah I wish I'd had more piano lessons cos I really can't play anything
B	yeah
A	I wish I did more of this
B	mm
A	whereas some places we've lived it's been like well there wasn't much to do so
B	mm
A	you know I could have done a few things but more or something
B	yeah
A	oh yeah
B	Don't sit around on our arses do we
A	sometimes I do
B	yeah but that's usually after a period of like working excessively hard or
A	mm
B	mm
A	mm
B	is that just to provide like rapeseed oil for like vegetable oil for the UK or do we export it?
A	I don't know but they get a subsidiary
B	mm
A	which is why
B	mm
A	I don't even see lavender fields anymore but Dad said there are some a long way up
B	mm
A	yeah it's pretty
B	yeah
A	you can get oil from so so many other things
B	mm
A	I think there is a possibility to but who's going to do it? I mean if they  if they  did use that as fuel then every single field would be covered in rape
B	mm
A	mm
B	and then they just covered everything with that and then they can't grow their own food so they have to export it and then they're over a barrel
A	yeah
B	well it was jungle
A	and then
B	well no
A	that
B	no
A	no
B	Cos it was jungle the first time I went there
A	rabbit
B	it was like a virgin rainforest
A	hmm
B	and then it was just all palm oil trees
A	mm
B	no that's why I was saying about the rape because that's what we used to do to all these other countries
A	yeah they don't want to
B	we used to make them grow well they used to be like banana republics
A	well I think that's basically what they've told the farmers here because if you don't  if you don't  grow rape then you don't get the the extra money
B	and that's what
A	so it's it's obviously more financially
B	yeah
A	wheat
B	yeah
A	it is pretty isn't it
B	it does look pretty yeah
A	mm
B	no
A	they've just stopped producing food
B	yeah and they could next year just change it I suppose
A	mm yeah yeah
B	I don't know what it does to the soil
A	I don't know
B	it might change the PH level or something
A	I don't know
B	ah it's beautiful isn't it
A	mm
B	yeah
A	if those clouds were different that would be a lovely photo
B	yep
A	oh I might come up here
A	ah
B	so what do you want to do tonight?
A	I don't know I feel quite relaxed
B	mhm
A	I've sorted out some stuff
A	but this habit of playing a game is is
B	yeah but we've got bugger all else to do at the moment
A	well we've got books to read
B	yeah
A	I should at least be learning
B	yeah yeah
A	oh do you want to learn it with me?
B	mm
A	oh it will be so much easier if we can test each other and play games and I don't know
B	yeah
A	but
B	that's my problem
A	I think you would have the motivation for it if you got into using them
B	it's just
A	you know
B	yeah
A	just think how how beneficial it would be er negotiating for a better price on a house just saying a few I don't know
B	what in England?
A	no no
B	that would work against you
A	in Oman
B	no well it does
A	so it's not
A	yeah er
B	that's Tunisian isn't it?
A	er er no I think you can say it but they say it slightly different
B	mm
A	so we've got to find out how they say it
B	yeah
A	they didn't have that
B	no
A	oh
B	it's a bit too much like hard work to me
A	well do you want to do it another night then?
B	yeah I'll do it another night yeah
A	mm?
B	yeah
A	mm maybe I'll try and learn like look at the letters again and try and test myself of what I've studied before to just to refresh my memory of it
B	mm
A	just for five minutes
B	mhm
A	I could do that
B	yeah
A	well I'd I'd still like to play a game I'm have no idea what time it is so by the time you play a game
B	well it's still light
A	our games are usually last an hour and a half
B	no they don't
A	I thought we'll play Settlers tonight
B	er could do
A	we haven't played that in ages
B	yeah
A	uh-huh
B	yeah could do
A	and then we've got a game of table tennis too to fit in so
B	well that's the night gone then isn't it
A	yeah
B	what's that over there? Is that a scarecrow?
A	oh I thought
B	no
A	looks like giant tent ghost thing
B	huh
A	actually that's quite scary now looking at it
B	yeah we're not there yet
A	oh oh
B	you do realise where we are?
A	oh God
B	well hang on
A	I'm turning pink
B	oh okay
A	and then er

B	no well I'm I'm watching football on Saturday and that's that
A	yes yes yes yeah yes

A	I can't believe you're you're saving up your beer for a Saturday
B	yeah
A	are you? I thought we could have one
B	no
A	maybe tonight?
B	no there's only ten in the box
A	oh
B	between three of us
A	yeah
B	do you know what I mean? mm
A	rationing of the beer
B	yeah I know
A	that's the one I said to buy
B	yeah
A	you said you were off creamy beers
B	well I'm just a bit bored of drinking like creamy bitter
A	mm
B	it's nice but it hasn't got you know a a twang
A	no
B	yeah well I could drink
A	yeah? Oh well
B	so who's playing on Saturday?

A	ah damn it
B	no that's the league
A	of the
B	if we're playing in the semi final it has to be a cup competition
A	Carling Cup?
B	no
A	Barclay's cup? Erm
B	yeah
A	I want to say financial because we've been talking about finance
B	how come you know Carling Cup but you don't know this one? Doesn't make any sense at all
A	I do know it it's just
B	it's the FA Cup
A	ah
B	and who's going to win?

A	Cos that's quite a long time isn't it
B	you've got a bottle of wine
A	no I haven't
B	well can't you drink that one and then replace it?
A	well I keep doing that but
B	yeah
A	it's not really the way to do it really
B	no they they don't take bottles of wine do they?
A	well it depends where they're going
B	mm
A	is this the radar plane coming?
B	no
A	there was another one that crashed into a a house wasn't there? Another another of those army planes
B	yeah probably
A	not in
B	yeah
A	well that wasn't a house though was it
B	yeah
A	that got covered up sharpish
B	yeah yeah
A	I wonder if you see something like that they pay you off?
A	do they?
B	no they'll probably come along with their black suits and shades and get that thing out and go
A	it's a home watch
B	home watch area
A	we're not that neighbourly
B	why's that? Is that cos theirs is that because there's so many Portuguese?
A	what?
B	well home is a lower level word than neighbourhood
A	I don't understand
B	I'm just being facetious really
A	bunny rabbit
B	run rabbit
A	oh look another rabbit
B	yeah
A	there is too many
B	yep
