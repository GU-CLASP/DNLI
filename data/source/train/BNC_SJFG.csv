C	no
B	so it's obviously stopped bleeding
C	it's bleeding a bit here and a bit underneath foot
C	here look but nothing to worry about
B	that was quite horrible weren't it?
C	yeah well she turned round and said to me well I'll come home don't worry about it the end look it's been there as well
B	oh yeah
C	she said don't worry about your toes bleeding because she said they will so when they tell you that
B	you don't you just think it's normal then don't you?
C	and I'm on aspirin anyway so but he wanted to kick cos
B	mm
C	but when you go to dentist they leave that off I said well you were gonna put me on warfarin for I had it to thin my blood
B	oh god
C	I said oh I'm on aspirin he said oh that's okay then
A	he said you you mustn't leave it off didn't he?
C	yeah he
B	oh
C	lisinopril anything ending with a pril
B	oh
C	and that's the only one he said and another thing she said to me

A	it should be erm like in a day they'll literally they can just they'll dip it when it gets there
C	yeah well if it's anything
B	that's what I was thinking cos if it's still
C	if it's anything bad they'll ring me up and say
A	yeah
C	you've got to have more antibiotics
A	yeah
C	well then if they do
A	yeah
C	I shall turn round I've got it in my bloody diary don't worry about that and the box I've got but I've got it written here

C	he said to me
A	mm
C	he
B	bloody hell
C	he said are you allergic to any antibiotics? I said no well I bloody well am
A	no
B	dosage is high though might've been that
B	crikey
C	and they looked it all up on the bloody net and I thought then
C	never felt so bad ever even though I'm eighty that's it
B	no
C	I bloody well did
B	it's the tablets isn't it?
C	I've never felt so bad as I
B	high dose as well innit? that's like four
A	two hundred milligrams yeah it's a lot
B	twice a day that's four hundred isn't it?
A	yeah
C	yeah I tell you I felt so bloody rough
B	pretty strong really isn't it?
A	mm yeah
B	like you said you've got the anaesthetic still in you as well haven't you? so that's going to make you feel awful
C	oh I tell you what I can see myself coming back
B	yeah innit?
C	and being sick and it running down my neck
A	mm
C	and it was just like egg yolk
A	yeah
B	oh god don't
C	and I I oh I felt bloody hell and then she said to me erm do you want to walk out to your car? cos
C	that
B	that's okay then
C	he really but then I've been good to him
B	oh god yeah look when he hurt his back and you was round there every day weren't you?
C	yeah
B	doing his meals and that yeah
C	took him to the doctor's went in with him cos he rang on me and the doc said to me like have you been his wife? I said I'm not his wife I'm his neighbour he said there's a pity there's not a few more neighbours another doctor said that when they were taking him off on the stretcher who's he got?
B	mm
A	he's he's just got hers hasn't he?
C	but honestly he took my little pink bag out the only thing I moaned at him for cos they put on the letter she told me where I'd got to go his sister had done my pre-med and then she said the first car park you come to it's the new
A	mm
C	course I went round there and we sat there no bloody lights on or anything
B	oh I remember you said they weren't open
C	quarter past seven and I said I'm supposed to be here at quarter past seven I said take me round the other end oh that worked oh he said they took me down
B	they weren't open?
C	there and they they took me straight down to my little room where I want to be
A	yeah
B	but yeah you said you'd come back
C	he said she said to me it's how near it is I said I know they even told me where to go
A	yeah
C	cos I said to oh I'll go and have a look so I know in the morning where to go well she said go in your car cos it's quite a little way to walk it's at the top
A	yeah
C	and that were the morn and I went in and enquired even at the desk and I said look here's my letter I'm coming in on Saturday is this the right? yes she said this is the one
A	yeah
C	I thought frigging well
A	yeah
C	and he said oh you give them time give them time I said you take me down that other bloody end and good job I did
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	he wouldn't have done
A	no he would have waited
C	and then one of the poor nurses got into trouble cos they were waiting for me to go down there she got to check everything and
B	oh yeah they do don't they? mm oh god
C	never mind it's all over now
A	that's
C	yeah I couldn't grumble they're nice there
B	yeah
A	yeah yeah they are good there
C	and then after she said you've got to eat something before you go home and I wondered what bloody get they asked me whether I wanted ham sandwiches tuna or cheese and I thought well I love cheese but I hadn't been eating a lot then before the
A	no
C	so anyway they brought four big thick slices oh look grated cheese with lettuce and tomato
A	mm
C	and I had a bite out of it
A	yeah
C	and then they brought me a ginger biscuit
A	yeah you ate that
B	oh they reckon that's supposed to help to settle the
A	in that in it yeah ginger yeah or rich tea they say don't they?
C	eating rich tea I did eat that and anyway then they said he the surgeon come in to see me he said everything went very well he said how you feeling? I said oh I'm a bit half a
A	mm
B	mm
C	and he said well we put the anti-sickness you know but it had made no effing difference to me
B	no
C	and he said everything went well so I thought that's the main thing
B	mm
A	yeah
C	innit?
A	yeah definitely
C	cos he said to me stand on your feet and when I did he said erm now just look at that foot to that one and he meant because
B	mm
A	yeah
C	it was it's no good saying it wasn't
A	well it's done now
B	just healing now isn't it? so
A	back on Saturday and they'll take X-rays
C	yeah
A	and make sure everything's okay with it
C	I'm hoping they're going to take some bandages
C	cos they said I've got no stitches to come off
A	no
C	because they're all
A	yeah I'm sure they'll take it off because I've checked like where you've got the blood at the top on your ankle but I think that's just the
C	yeah
A	yeah yeah
B	I think they've been rubbing it a bit innit?
A	I I think it's where that metal bit's gone through the toe I think it must come out of about here somewhere
C	yeah yeah
B	it comes out the top end
A	cos it's rubbing
B	yeah
A	so they'll probably take that off and
B	they'll put clean dressing on yeah so
A	yeah
C	I come home like that
B	mm
C	cos this shoe was put on without that
B	that's right yeah
B	yeah
C	but she told me not to worry
B	but no they'll take it all off X-ray it
A	yeah they will check it
B	and then they'll put clean dressing on it
C	don't worry because she said if it does bleed on the ends of your toes so I didn't bother
A	mm
B	mm
A	that's it there's sort of there's cuts and stuff aren't there? and then
C	but with aspirin I thought oh it'd be worse
A	yeah
C	and I thought there would be more showing than that
B	mm
A	yeah
C	yeah so
A	must be healing alright in there
B	yeah
C	I'm happy
A	oh you sorted the flowers out or did you do that
B	yeah
A	oh you did yeah I know you was I was thinking yesterday I thought it must look a bit
