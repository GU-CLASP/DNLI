B	okay
A	there we go have a have a Quality Street and I'll
B	oh
A	I'll tell you my depressing saga
B	yes
A	oh it is depressing
B	thank you
A	it's not what you think anyway what are you thinking?
B	I was worried it was about your friend
A	oh it is
B	no
A	last year
B	right
A	and she was fine but then
A	that she couldn't get rid off
B	mm
A	but anyway just before half-term I spoke to her
B	mm
A	but they gave her antibiotics and they let her out
B	mm
A	but he said I have looked at a few and it looks okay to me
B	how strong is she?
A	yeah and you know cos you just your immune system's low isn't it?
A	it's in the lining of the liver
B	oh
A	and somewhere else and somewhere else
A	and she said
B	mm
A	but when I phoned her back she said oh
B	they could extend it for?
A	up to two years but then you don't know what her quality of life'll be for those two years do you or it might not be two years so she probably won't make fifty
B	does she want to spend those two years going constantly through chemotherapy radiotherapy?
A	I know
B	feeling like that?
A	and her children are
A	she got them years nine and
B	mm
A	how awful
A	awful
B	that's awful
A	I don't know what to say I just thought oh my
B	mm
A	you know I'm gonna beat this
B	and she did
A	and and she did
B	yeah
A	and she said to me on the phone this week she said
B	yeah
A	now
B	mm
A	how awful
B	mm god
A	just awful
A	oh it was really
B	I thought about her the other day
A	yeah well I mean and I've only spoken to her sort of on and off cos obviously they're down in
B	mm
A	and I really must go and
B	mm
A	it's so difficult
B	mm
A	let
B	you can do that can't you?
A	yes but they always want us all to go cos
B	mm
A	you know they always ask after them
A	on we're not doing
A	yeah
B	mm
A	but you can't even do it because your children are at school you can't even say
A	and see a bit of the world I
B	yeah well there is yeah
A	yeah
B	you know he erm
A	yeah
B	and they just did everything that they'd wanted to do
A	mm
B	but they had ten years to do that
A	had they sort of expected ten years though?
B	yeah
A	or was it one of those where the doctor had said and then they'd
B	no
A	lived long oh
B	no
A	they did?
B	because his I remember when he told us
A	oh
B	he knew
A	really?
B	but
A	oh okay
B	because I think in the end
A	mm
A	see and that and that's
B	mm
A	cos she's been coughing all summer but
B	mm
A	and part of me still thinks
B	mm
A	the more it spreads the quicker it is I suppose isn't it?
B	mm
A	yeah
B	and it just goes spreads round
A	but but you know the the the awful thing is as well that
B	mm
A	twenty-odd years now
A	and she was diagnosed when she was expecting their second child so they couldn't even start the treatment until you know?
B	mm
A	and she I think the baby was two when she died
[ANNOTATION]	She was diagnosed when she was not pregnant	Contradiction
B	mm
A	and now
B	mm
A	and I just think you know by the in your in your mid-forties that's just awful isn't it?
B	it is
A	awful
B	it is
A	anyway let's let's not talk about depressing things anymore
B	it's terrible
A	that's all we talk about
B	no
A	you're not?
[ANNOTATION]	The only thing that they talk about is about their jobs	Neutral
B	because
A	oh they've decided to
B	let's
A	yeah
A	reignite it whatever
B	yes
A	yes yeah
[ANNOTATION]	They haven't decided anything yet	Contradiction
B	erm
A	oh okay
B	to that yeah
A	cos I
B	mm
A	excuse me I said oh
B	mm
A	and it looked quite a reasonable price way
[ANNOTATION]	According to speaker A the price was very reasonable	Entailment
B	yeah
A	cheaper than the rugby club actually
B	yeah
A	but he said is there anybody else going that we know?
B	well we've done the rugby club one before
A	yeah we have
B	erm which the boys liked because it had loads of funfair rides and stuff
A	I
[ANNOTATION]	The guys really enjoyed it because of the funfair rides and other activities	Entailment
B	no not
A	I thought it was really
B	yeah
A	mm
B	and he likes going on all of that
A	yes
[ANNOTATION]	He really enjoys going to all of that	Entailment
A	yeah
B	but erm
A	it was just a suggestion that I put to
B	mm
A	you know
B	mm
A	and
B	I would
A	other stuff
B	yeah
A	so perhaps
[ANNOTATION]	they are not sure about suggestion	Neutral
B	I would've said
A	yes yeah
B	with you
A	yeah
B	but
A	is he doing the hockey on Sunday cos they've got a football match again this Sunday haven't they?
B	mm
[ANNOTATION]	they are not sure about hokey match	Neutral

A	just waiting for the phone
B	well
[ANNOTATION]	person A is waiting for the phone	Entailment
A	oh
A	at the
B	yeah
A	was it good?
B	it was very good because technically
A	oh so it was
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about a film	Contradiction
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	and
A	oh
B	and so
B	so there's
[ANNOTATION]	they are not sure	Neutral
B	I just got visions of them all crashing into the wings like oh
B	they didn't look like that from the stage it looked beautiful
A	oh really
B	and it was all twinkly and sparkly and loads of dry ice and
A	wow
B	the grown-up rugby players are vomiting it's so scary and
[ANNOTATION]	they are not sure about rugby players	Neutral
A	yeah
B	disorientated and they were
A	oh wow
B	but as a story it felt more pantomimey
A	oh it wasn't
B	so
A	it wasn't a
B	no no
A	oh
B	so Peter Pan
A	when you said it I assumed it was a pantomime actually
B	The Musical
A	oh okay
B	Peter Pan The Musical
A	cos I was gonna say that was early to have your pantomime already
B	yeah
A	but it
B	no
A	that explains it

B	I don't know
A	and then there was another one afterwards
B	mm
A	depending on how
B	well I remember now because I saw my friend
A	so
B	with a fish and chip supper
A	but that's finished now so
B	yeah
A	that one's done and it's just the school show but I should go and see him

B	mm
A	cos they had about an hour to wait before their race and they're
B	mm
A	which is ridiculous
B	mm
A	because it's not normal
B	mm

B	they've got a pitch at you know the AstroTurf?
A	oh did they?
B	yeah
A	did they go down there and?

B	oh
A	erm
B	mm
A	you know everybody
B	mm
A	and last no he didn't go last year cos we were away on holiday but the year before which is the last time he went
B	mm
A	you're fourteen you can't go
B	mm
A	you know it's intimidating and he was like oh well there's a sixth-former going there's so-and-so going and it's on the

A	but really I was so relieved cos he
A	but to me fourteen he's like so big
B	I don't know I have got a different
A	oh you see I don't like I don't like Halloween so I'm probably a little bit
B	we had a
A	biased anyway because I just don't like Halloween
B	what we do we live in a lane where there's about
A	can they come trick or treating?
B	can they come to your house?
A	yeah
B	and then she supplied them with all the stuff
A	oh she supplied them with the all sweets?
B	yeah
A	ah
B	so then she went she made up all these different bags and whatever and went round the day before and gave them all out
B	and then what happened was
A	yeah
B	and erm and then we'd go back and we'd have a Halloween tea
A	mm
B	and they know and and
A	and and that's how it was here when the boys were small
B	yeah
A	we'd cos you'd all been to the toddler groups and they'd all started school together and you'd go around to the houses of the of their friends
B	mm
A	basically or you knew
B	exactly
A	that they were in and that and you know and
B	mm
A	to go off on your own to just knock on people's door I said to
B	just to get sweets
A	you just
B	mm
A	he really should've outgrown it
B	well like I say we
A	but she's still got a
B	but we've got a six-year-old
A	yeah you've still got
B	yeah
A	you've still got
B	yeah
A	an appropriately aged
B	and
A	yes yeah
B	that knew we were coming basically and
A	and that and that was my issue with
A	to go onto the to the new Waitrose estate and all around there
B	mm
A	but it was two years ago that
A	no well that's your friend who's also twelve who just wouldn't entertain the idea of going out trick or treating
B	yeah
A	cos it's for little kids
B	well when
B	and
A	with children yes
B	you know?
A	yeah
B	he wasn't going up
A	yeah
B	as a grown-up
A	and that was and that was how it started originally
A	he's got a little brother
B	mm
A	but and and
B	mm
A	again because I know the people in
B	mm
A	and he's just
B	yeah
A	imagine if he knocked on the wrong door and some old person came and
A	right he's probably right but
B	well I did say to
A	sweets
B	and I and I said
A	mm mm
B	and people that had got pumpkins outside and witches hanging off their garage doors and stuff like that

B	mm
[ANNOTATION]	they are not sure about watching a game	Neutral
A	calling out the
B	there's more skill
A	but if you're
B	mm
A	er
B	well I was just saying
B	it's you've got to have a loud voice a clear voice you've got to be decisive you've got to make the right call obviously the scores the right way round
A	mm
B	erm serves and things like that you know if they're out or whatever you have to just
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about weather	Contradiction
A	yeah yeah yeah
A	mm
B	it is solid
