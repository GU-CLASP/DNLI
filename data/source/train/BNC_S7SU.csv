C	philistine that he is he doesn't like red wine
A	ah
C	what a weirdo
A	what is
C	so he drank it and he says yeah it's alright and I was like never mind it's a good enough pinot
C	what could have gone wrong?
A	you've gone wrong in the head I'm afraid
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	and he went to the shop and he ordered one and he's like oh yeah yeah let's take one and he drank it and was like ugh that's disgusting I only like good wine and I said oh you buy good wine and he said well I haven't got any
A	oh no
C	oh I thought he had a really refined pallet when it came to wine and I think it was all bollocks
A	maybe
C	yeah
A	he has been told that it's a good wine not because it's a good wine
C	yeah
A	which tends to happen which is to be fair frankly enough that you're an alcoholic
C	yeah
A	I couldn't quite get bothered
C	yeah
A	I'm about I am going to sieve this spaghetti bolognaise
C	okay
A	because it's quite runny
C	oh okay
A	add lots of sausage
C	sausage
A	sausage
C	oh
A	sausages
C	I'm so attuned to the word sausage
C	sausage
A	um I haven't heard back from that uh guy after the threesome thing comment
C	oh really?
A	hmm
C	interesting for three years and playing every ten minutes
A	yes
C	cheers
A	and all last night
C	hmm
A	I mean
C	isn't it?  isn't it?  I thought
A	oh
C	it's normally over a tenner and it was a eight
A	it's really nice
C	yeah
A	no
C	it's just really smooth and I love it
A	what is the? A good cheap wine is the Ernest Gallo
C	oh is it?
A	the merlot
C	oh okay that's interesting
A	yeah
C	well it's just
A	as far a cheap bottle of red goes
C	yeah
A	it's actually quite good
C	ah that's a good it's good top tip there
A	I know
C	hmm
A	but um we over Christmas when we had a bottle of port uh
C	hmm
A	in the house
C	as you do
A	not extremely not like great port it's just like
C	hmm
A	you know room stuff
C	yeah that's good
A	um yeah so we had this bottle of port and we got a bottle of wine and it just tasted like vinegar wine and I don't know if it's expensive or not
C	hmm
A	but it tasted like vinegar wine
C	oh dear
A	uh and we put a drop of port in it
C	oh yeah?
A	freaking awesome saves any wine
C	wow
A	yes that's what we just started doing
C	yeah
A	drop a port in
C	yeah cos it's fortified wine isn't it port?
A	yeah
C	it's just really strong wine
A	yeah
C	oh
A	yeah
C	it's a good top tip
A	yeah
C	hmm
A	yeah
C	yeah well that sounds good
A	hmm so that was a a good top tip
C	uh hmm bunch of alcoholics
A	yeah I mean really we should have thought about it with it being fortified wine
C	hmm
A	I just think it's vinegar wine don't you? You just have to
C	yeah
A	cook with it
C	I mean um obviously we can you know you can buy you can bulk buy can you? It actually brings the price right down
A	yeah
C	but then you do have like a million bottles of wine in the house that you will all just drink
A	all drink yeah cos they're there
C	especially when
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	really?
A	as in
C	so
A	boxes of twelve
C	yeah
A	I took two of them
C	shit
A	yeah I mean there's three of them drinking in the house
C	and they're animals
A	and they're animals
C	hmm
A	uh but yeah that's what I thought they not going to make it till Christmas
C	that is the way forward isn't it?
A	and also a
C	hmm
A	and provided you can keep it like that's what I was going to do with the
C	no and you'll just drink lots and lots of wine
A	and become a heifer
C	well or
C	take some over to A and A
A	or A A or A and E
C	A and E
A	of all of the places to check in
C	uh hmm
A	oh so it sounds like your evening went really well then?
C	it was nice
A	aww
C	it'll be  it'll be  like having a personal trainer
A	yes so I was saying if you could report back
C	yeah
A	or if you do become good friends with him
C	yeah
A	he could help me with with the navy
C	well exactly
A	oh my God
C	he was in the army
A	this girl is so fun
C	I know
A	you just keep looking up all these different things
C	ah he was in the army
A	this is  this is great
C	yeah
A	this is fantastic
C	so he's a  he's a  top character
A	oh he likes The Big Question?
C	he likes The Big Question
A	that is such a great thing
C	I know it's good isn't it? Um although we differ on a lot of things and I
A	porridge
C	yeah it's good
A	uh
C	the thing is
A	pretty strong
C	well yeah
A	I mean I'm well I'm actually agreeing with him however
C	you are going to join the navy so essentially that is going to be a part of your re thought
A	yeah
C	um
A	they shouldn't get to the point where they're bad people in actual fact
C	no
A	if they were doing their job properly
C	exactly
A	need to be shot because they should never be able to get to where they are
C	yeah but basically that's their
A	fucking cut you right out
C	yeah he said
A	hmm
C	you know I mean my sister hasn't been
A	hmm
C	hurt or my
A	yeah
C	I don't know anyone that has been killed and
A	for you to have that anger
C	yeah
A	perhaps where
C	yeah you just
A	you never know if you would capitalise it
C	don't know
A	yeah
C	you can't make that call really
A	yeah
C	so um maybe I would think differently
A	the potatoes are well they look like perfect potatoes mum
C	well I hope so
C	yeah and
A	really?
C	yeah
A	oh
C	so they should be okay
A	which is good
C	hmm
A	yeah
C	than I can come around to what he thinks cos whenever he says stuff like that I think you've gone wrong
A	yeah
C	just a little bit
A	yeah
C	I just think um so stuff like stuff that he will never change his mind on
A	yeah
C	you know killing bad people cos he was in the army and ultimately I think that's
A	I hope I haven't taken like too much out of it
C	no it will be grand just put the good stuff
A	hot
C	do you want to shovel shovel shovel?
C	yeah
A	if you're if you really feel strongly about something no matter how much you debate it you're not going to take anything away from it are you?
C	yeah
A	maybe you should relinquish it
C	exactly
A	uh hmm
C	that is basically your condimental ideology like
A	yeah
C	he's not going to change his mind on that and
A	how old is he?
C	thirty-six
A	hmm
C	right obviously he he's had kids young
A	oh right okay
C	yeah
A	we don't care
C	that's fine
A	it entertainment isn't it? It's the entertainment factor
C	it really is
A	that's good
C	so yeah um it's fine
A	hmm
C	um probably seven point five
A	oh
C	cute
A	wow that's quite good
C	I mean he's not someone that you would look at and think god he's hot
A	yeah
C	I think because he he's got that cheeky chappy
A	do you think I need to make some more spag ball?
C	we can always come back and do a second sitting
A	yeah we could do that
C	yeah
A	or shall we just do it at one go in?
C	oh yeah maybe we should just do it
A	just chop it in
C	yeah and I
A	I thought  I thought  there was a lot of it cos obviously lot of it is liquid
C	hmm yummy
A	oh
C	I guess that happens with the tomato
A	hmm and I think as well the mince wasn't very good that I used
C	oh yeah they were a bit of uh seepage
A	seepage
C	oh
A	let's burn you up in there
C	how can it be Sunday night already? I feel like it has been a busy weekend isn't it? Yeah
A	I feel like uh
A	yeah
C	lost two days of your life
A	yeah but it's such a pain cos you look forward to the weekend don't you?
C	yeah absolutely
A	and we haven't seen much of it
C	hmm and it sounds like you had a really nice time
A	I need another day
C	yeah
A	Friday's should be a weekend or even
C	or Monday's
A	if it should just be a half day on Friday
C	yeah
A	so then you can get all your shopping done or washing done or whatever you wanted to do if everyone left work on midday on Friday
C	that would be pretty nice wouldn't it? When I worked at
A	hmm
C	yeah
A	I can't remember there I was only there for three days
C	I think at the time we did um
A	yeah
C	um shift was supposed to be nine till five but because that we worked as temps in the summer it was really busy
A	oh
C	it was really good and then yeah we did overtime
A	so I never really understood this about our company especially like  you know they say that we really want you to find a really healthy work life balance
C	yeah
A	but nobody we don't take phone calls in our department usually
C	oh right
A	and uh on a Friday afternoon
C	uh hmm
A	because nobody wants to call
C	hmm
A	I don't really think business wise it won't make that much of a difference
C	uh hmm
A	and also because we've got a full time reception twenty-four hours that can take messages so
C	yeah
A	it's also their job
C	really?
A	wages
C	that's weird isn't it? How the departments could be that different
A	hmm
C	that's just shit
A	we're going to need to
C	yeah
A	it depends on which business we've got as to how many hours that they get and stuff
C	okay
A	but if they really wanted us to have a healthy work life balance given that we'll come in on stupid days for events or or stay longer or and nobody else does that
C	hmm
A	they finish their shifts somebody else takes over from them and that's that
C	yeah
A	you think they would say okay you can
C	hmm
A	and given the hours and the stress that you're under generally
C	hmm
A	you just do it
C	as a little courtesy
A	yeah
C	A little thank you
A	and then maybe the managers could take that time if they wanted to
C	hmm
A	to prep for the next week
C	? Uh what is it?
A	it's uh garlic
C	wow
C	do you like a bit of garlic?
A	oh garlic yeah
C	the garlic's disappeared isn't it? Uh
A	no
C	oh okay
A	yeah cos not many people call and or if they do they call for things like generic things like what's the parking like
C	hmm
A	cos we arriving in
C	hmm
A	but the reception should deal with them they're just not
C	Good
A	oh
C	yeah
A	uh hmm
C	about what to do but I don't know  I don't know  if she's actually made plans cos she's she suggested this Saturday so I don't know whether she seemed
A	yeah
C	well I'll let you know if she comes back with anything
A	uh yes
C	hmm
A	I can't remember if it was free entry
C	oh okay
A	so that's pretty good
C	yup
A	hmm done
A	oh no
C	to go for a pee and he came back and he never wanted to
A	poor you
C	thank you
A	or the boudoir?
C	um clear the table
A	yeah
C	that's where we'll be eating isn't it?
A	yeah
C	thank you
A	I suppose
C	not a problem
A	you say that they're the one thing I can't cook you know
C	are they?
A	I can't cook potatoes
C	oh
A	I suppose cos I'll try not to eat them cos I can't cook potatoes
C	yeah
A	it never does
C	it never works
C	hmm
A	hmm oh this is standard  this is standard
C	standard didn't go there
A	yeah
C	did you say you saw toothless
A	oh yeah
C	oh
A	hmm
A	and he caught me really off guard
C	oh
A	so I thought cos I thought he wouldn't say anything cos he would be embarrassed about it you know
C	uh hmm
A	and so I thought what do I say? Do I say yes I know?
C	we'd be gossiping about you
A	hmm?
C	uh hmm
A	or do I say no I haven't got a clue and then he tells me and
C	yeah
A	so I thought on my feet and laughed
C	hmm
A	and said oh yeah that was really funny
C	uh hmm
A	really great like really funny thing to do
C	uh hmm
A	and he was like yeah when I got home the next day I put my coat on and in but in my pocket I have the flower head and a load of leaves
C	oh no
A	and no stem
C	no
A	and I said to him yeah you know I had a really good really fun night and um you know so
C	oh bless him
A	I just thought I'd and I said yeah I said well it's not it's so I said I've no she had a nice time
C	hmm
A	uh hmm
C	uh hmm hmm
A	and he was like yeah of cos he does
C	you're not
A	just you anybody in the world
C	hmm
A	anybody in the world
A	hmm you know maybe next time she's here um and I said  I said  oh well you know yeah definitely the next time she comes here with me
C	hmm
A	I'll let you know if we're coming out
C	nice
A	umm I said but certainly one on one she wouldn't feel comfortable in
C	uh hmm
A	doing that
C	oh God
A	just so she felt she knew she was welcome
C	hmm
A	what was that?
C	who can say?
C	who can say? Well thanks mate
A	uh hmm
C	you really sort of laid the ground work cos I've been there it would have all been really awkward
A	wouldn't it?
C	yeah
A	hmm and I
C	hmm
A	I can't I don't think they I don't think I made a joke about the cat card
C	no
A	I hope I didn't
C	no
A	yeah
C	hmm
A	or whether he actually thought that you know he actually thought of it as a friend thing and as a bit of a joke
C	hmm
A	I think it was probably a bit of half and half
C	hmm
A	hmm
C	and it was thought and effort it was really nice
A	bless
C	he's a nice guy
A	hmm
C	just not all of them
A	well
C	just not all the teeth
A	I was trying to eye up a little bit
C	hmm
A	see what teeth he had got missing and I couldn't notice any of them missing
C	hmm?
A	I mean they're black and fucked but
C	hmm
A	uh hmm
C	would you reckon kissing that guy?
A	hmm?
C	Christ
A	Jesus
C	hmm
A	so maybe he has got teeth and they're just fucked but I couldn't see back far enough to see if they have got holes
C	hmm
A	and my teeth didn't fall out till I was my baby teeth didn't fall out until I was nineteen
C	oh
A	hmm
C	hmm?
A	you see?
C	you'd never notice
A	yeah
C	hmm
A	Cos as I've grown it's kinda pushed together a bit
C	hmm
A	had there was it was a big enough for a tooth in it when it started
C	hmm
A	but I have one one tooth two less
C	hmm
A	on both sides
C	okay
A	I don't know why
C	hmm
A	so I can't really you know prey on poor old toothless
C	doesn't he?
A	hmm  I've noticed that
C	are they?
A	hmm
A	that bit
C	that's fillings isn't it? Like if you don't have a white
A	oh
C	Cos it's for cosmetic reasons
A	oh
A	yeah
C	they would have done a white cap on it
A	hmm
C	with a white filling but because it's the back he would have made that decision where you can't really see or just have a mercury filling probably
A	ooh
C	but the thing is you can obviously notice
A	yeah
C	hmm
A	but plus I've got quite a few fillings
C	I think you've just got to make the call about where it is like even if it was at the back of my front teeth I would have white
A	hmm
C	because you
A	at the front teeth
C	know yeah
A	yeah
C	but like this one was the second from the back and so I just thought
A	oh God
C	no it's everybody like a dentist that's it
A	uh hmm
C	it's not if they were looking down there
A	yeah
C	uh hmm
A	um cos I didn't know when the the next time I would go to a dentist would be
C	hmm
A	uh and he gave me seven fillings in one go
C	shit
A	yeah and at the time I thought that's like that's extreme he said no it's nothing they're just little ones
C	I don't know if you can actually do that
A	I don't know  I don't know  um
C	wow
A	but since the other dentist I went to after that was like holy fuck why have you got all these fillings?
C	really?
A	yeah and
A	and they were just a just in case
C	shit
A	yeah and they were like five at the time
C	hmm
A	I didn't pay for it but
C	such
A	wow
C	they're white and they did it to all of our teeth
A	oh
C	I was probably about seven or eight and
A	I didn't even have my adult teeth by then
C	really?
A	no
C	I think I'm remembering it wrong then cos that sounds young doesn't it?
A	hmm
C	maybe it was when I was at secondary school but I just remember feeling very young
A	hmm
C	isn't it? I can't remember I thought it was when I was in primary school
A	Cos I remember in year six mum was gonna pay for me to have all my teeth painted like coated
C	oh yeah
A	which might be the same type of thing
C	hmm
A	all of them and he said we can't do it until you've got your adult teeth
C	oh okay
A	yeah
C	sort of pre empting I think
A	protecting
C	yeah they had you know they didn't have you know a good dental care when they were kids and I suppose they got
A	yeah
C	I guess they were really into us like brush your teeth you know twice a day um look after your teeth cos once they're gone it's you're fucked
A	hmm
C	yeah
A	they are awesome
C	yeah
A	they're actual perfect
C	they're a bit more soggy than I wanted but there was a bit of a crunch there
A	I like them soggy
C	yeah
A	hmm hmm
C	they probably sat in the uh oven for a while longer
A	ah
A	no I don't
C	Good for you
A	I was going to say I really need to learn how to cook them
C	it's dangerous
A	then I thought no I don't
C	when I'm at my mum's
A	hmm
C	for a nice little flavour and then olive oil
A	yum
C	so that wasn't bad really
A	awesome
C	no
A	hmm
C	like he tried to make me a protein shake earlier and I was like I don't really like drinking
A	hmm
C	just bare that in mind when you're creating this diet plan for me and he said no we'll sit down and you can tell me your favourite food and I was like it consists of any sandwiches
A	fish fingers and sandwiches
C	that would be fab I'm not feeling very confident
A	hmm
C	I suppose and they are really good to have before the gym aren't they? Cos they do give you that energy boost and then you just
A	hmm
C	you just hammer it
A	hmm
C	it's really what you want
A	yeah
C	he said you've got to do it until you feel sick and I was like ha ha ha
A	do the gym?
C	yeah and then I looked at him
A	yeah
C	I realised he wasn't joking
A	yeah I know I do
A	when I go on the weights like the one that you push this way
C	hmm
A	I do
C	well like
A	until I feel like woozy
C	no
A	but I pull down I never feel sick on that but the one that I have to push up
C	hmm
A	literally my head's spinning but I have to just I just finish the three sets and that's it
C	keep doing that
A	oh yeah I've seen one of those at my gym
C	I don't know if you've got one of those there?
A	but if you have a look
C	like bench presses
A	or probably I'll show you
C	hmm
A	on our gym they have pictures in the corner
C	oh okay
A	and it shows you what muscle groups you work
C	oh okay
A	so I always make sure I get
C	hmm
A	and the back one
C	hmm
A	but
C	hmm
A	and he's actually not well he is a crazy horse but he's actually not as freaky as I thought he was
C	yeah
A	jaws of life
C	you wouldn't trust him
A	yeah
C	hmm
A	um but he's actually quite cleared up
C	hmm?
A	he's not I thought he was I thought  I thought  he was really really thick
C	hmm
A	which is never never wonderful
C	it's never that line
A	he used to be in the cadets
C	right
A	uh training to be in the RAF
C	hmm
A	um and was training to be in the marines
C	oh
A	and now he's
C	that's a shame
A	yeah and he doesn't want to go in as uh entry level
C	uh hmm
A	in the army or in the RAF but he's not bright enough to get in as an officer
C	hmm
A	he's you're not going to say I'm not brave enough I can't do that type of thing
C	hmm
A	um he was saying there's this thing right? Cos obviously he he's quite built I don't know how cos he looks so  and I thought
C	oh yeah you can add we've got loads of attachments yeah
A	yeah what is? So I just thought well I'm not going anywhere near that
C	hmm
A	Cos it looks like a frame isn't it? With the two like leads that come off it
C	hmm
A	but apparently if you do that it's supposed to work every single core muscle
C	really?
A	yeah
C	wow
A	and he saying to do to
C	hmm
A	yeah
C	wow
A	I need to get  I need to get  on that
C	yeah
A	Cos you have to use everything to pull it
C	oh
A	so you're not sat on anything
C	okay
A	and I think he said that apparently
C	hmm
A	keep yourself in the same position and then move the muscles that the thing is supposed to work
C	wow
A	I know
C	you need to find out
A	ask him about the the lead thing
C	uh there are amazing amount of ways I supposed that
A	hmm
C	there's one where you've got uh
A	have you got one of the lap?
C	lie down
C	like that
A	you know what that's supposed to be for? Doing sit ups but put your head in the bottom
C	shit
A	awkward like that
C	because I was talking to Dan about this
A	fuck that
C	obviously he's in the army and he was like you're better off doing the little ones
A	the crunches
C	like they're keeping you taunt the whole time
A	yeah
C	I haven't told him all that
A	I don't think it's as bad as the cardio
C	hmm
A	a bit sometimes
C	I think I don't push myself the same way I do with the cardio
A	hmm
C	I'd stop that
A	I only push myself till I'm set when I've when I first start on a thing
C	hmm
A	or whatever it is
C	hmm
A	and if I can do it then I'll just put the peg in that one
C	hmm
A	and if I can finish the ten by the  by the  time I push up on the nine
C	hmm
A	it should be really hard
C	hmm
A	and that means by the time I'm in the third lap by the time I get to five I think I can't do anymore
C	yeah
A	so it's not  it's not  too much of a push but I think that it's different with the weights isn't it? Cos you can't push yourself
C	yeah
A	your body physically can't make it
C	hmm
A	do you know what I mean?
C	yeah
A	like your body is capable of doing more than your mind let's you use
C	yeah
A	whereas if you can't push with your arm you can't just
C	it's not going to happen
A	it's not going to happen
C	hmm
A	oh I'm quite excited to try my new shoes out
C	new shoes
A	new shoes
C	sounds like
A	I haven't quite got it yet
C	hmm
A	I wanted to go to for a run by the river and then I thought well I'll only  I'll only  make it as far as the river and need to turn back again because I can't run that far
C	yeah
A	hmm
C	yeah
A	just around the corner down to the church is and park your car there and then you'd start near the bridge
C	yeah
A	but it seems a bit ridiculous for me to have to drive around the corner
C	it's a bit of waste of your time and petrol
A	hmm
C	besides you'd be stuck in traffic jam
A	no I just go down to the bottom of the street turn left turn right and park
C	oh I see
A	walk back
C	Cos that's
A	yeah that's true
C	and then
A	yeah
C	and then you'd be able to tell how much more you can run with each one you do if you run a bigger distance
A	hmm
C	um if you're planning to do
A	I need to do this  I need to do this
C	yeah even though it's snowing stroke raining
A	no
C	and the good thing is the night's are getting shorter uh longer
A	hmm
C	in fact actually that's just the end of March isn't it the clocks go forward?
C	we're nearly there
A	aw
C	I'm a light sleeper obviously
A	yeah
C	more potatoes?
A	oh I'd love some more potatoes
C	yeah
A	we used to do this after Sunday dinner
C	hmm
A	come and have cold roast potatoes
C	with a bit of a cold gravy
A	yup
C	amazing
A	thanks
C	oh oh oh you had to dig in
A	thanks
C	thanks great
A	hmm hmm hmm
C	yummy
A	oh yum
C	they're a little bit crispy that's good
A	winner
C	hmm
A	because on a Sunday we used to I don't know where I got it from
C	yeah it's pretty nice
A	so you'd cut it up like this?
C	no
A	still whole?
C	still whole and then sprinkle
A	with the paper towel under it?
C	hmm well that's just to keep the olive oil from running everywhere
A	oh
C	Good tip
A	rub it on
C	rub it on
A	oh
C	hmm
A	hmm
C	hmm
A	such a shame
C	they're the most addictive carbolicious
A	are they?
C	hmm
A	in my head they are
C	I think roast potatoes are the best thing ever
A	yeah
C	hmm
A	actually it's strange yeah because they're quite a plain taste aren't they?
C	hmm
A	so it seems strange that they're the things that you'd be like oh
C	this is really comforting isn't it? Warming and filling
A	have you ever had um a jacket potato from town on that uh
C	yeah train stop thing
A	hmm
C	I love it
A	oh I haven't had that
C	right
A	um and still now really if I'll make them I'll scoop the potato out in the middle
C	hmm
A	hmm
C	yeah
A	but these are small
C	yeah
A	so I just maybe scoop just the middle chunk of potato out and then my
C	oh okay
A	so I still leave like maybe a centimetre of potato around the edge
C	hmm
A	um and when I worked at Top Shop the girls at Top Shop were like oh yeah it's really good you need to go there for your lunch
C	do they?
A	uh huh
A	uh hmm
C	hmm and you've got quite an active job when you work in a shop you're running up and down a shop although you've been quite active now but
A	hmm
C	maybe less so when you're working in a shop you're constantly running around aren't you?
A	yeah
C	hmm
A	but um yeah cos we'd get them and I'd begin one and not finish it and I'm bigger than all of them
C	uh hmm
A	and they'd clear the lot
C	I know it is good
A	hmm
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about book	Contradiction
C	for a pair I think wasn't it?
A	hmm
C	but it was nice
A	yeah a bit like the curry sauce you get from the chips shop
C	yeah
C	oh
A	that sounds awesome
C	it was so good
A	hmm
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about curry sauce	Neutral
C	I was quite tempted to get one of the hotdog from the sausage company yeah
A	uh hmm
[ANNOTATION]	person B is talking about football	Contradiction
C	the hot dogs there are really nice
A	yeah I know
C	sausages
A	ah
A	wow
C	they've got lots of relishes that they put on
A	this place is expensive to live in
C	it's ridic isn't it? Cos I mean the cost of living considering
A	if someone
C	that
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about food	Neutral
C	they don't take that
A	Cos that what they'll tell you
C	no
A	yeah
C	hmm
A	what do you call them?
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about party	Contradiction
A	yeah
C	right
A	like proper hotdog sausages
C	hmm
A	and they're like the bread bun with like a French stick
C	hmm
A	and they'd put this thing in it and it took a hole out in the middle that was the perfect size of the sausage and then pop the sausage in
C	no
A	yeah
C	nice
A	do they?
C	with the sausages
A	oh
C	not like you put bread in the thing but they you know the it's a German
A	hmm
C	it's been
A	hmm
C	I suppose it's a bit of afar from the hotel
A	yeah but then wouldn't you starve? That's the thing I don't  I don't  start going somewhere
C	hmm
A	I have to get something for lunch cos then I'd want to
C	oh yeah
A	and I had that sandwich and I got two cos I couldn't decide if I could eat two or not
C	hmm
A	well it turns out I don't eat two I eat one
C	hmm
A	but that's my favourite sandwich now in the world ever
C	hmm yum
A	I should never have tried it and now every time they go
C	it's a slippery slope
A	and
C	hmm
A	then she's like I always get this and I was like yeah me too
A	that doesn't surprise me
C	I
A	yeah
C	I mean they're sole addiction
A	yup
C	uh hmm
A	um as opposed to just the one that you need please give them the eagle eye evil eye
C	oh
A	um we're trying to save the planet or something like
C	that's
A	please please give our workers the evil eye so if they basically thrust them at you
C	fine will do hence take the napkin
A	sounds a bit normal
C	hmm
A	yeah
C	oh I thought it was a Milky Way underneath the fridge the freezer I bet it's not that it actually a spanner
A	oh screw
C	screwdriver
A	screwdriver
C	I just saw it winking at me and I thought it was a sign of the Milky Way
A	oh I would really love some Milky Way right now
C	yeah
C	no
A	uh blimey
C	tell me
A	please don't I'm so sorry they're awful
C	ah
A	they really are awful they're the worst thing I've ever tried in my life ever
C	why don't we have any chocolate in the house?
C	for this reason
A	yes
C	Cos you will eat the chocolate
A	I'd eat all the chocolate
C	ah did you watch any?
A	do you think?
C	sorry?
A	I was going to say do you think you could deliver online? Like when we ordered the chicken? Do you think they'd deliver us chocolate?
C	possibly but we might have to bulk buy in which case you've might have to have crates of Milky Way and we might not ever
A	ever fit out the door
C	work tomorrow
C	passed out
A	I didn't no I didn't
C	hmm
A	watch them
C	oh you didn't

C	no
A	well where's the little thing?
C	you can get them mended it's fine
A	yeah I'll have to take it somewhere and
C	aw
A	yeah I didn't it was on here
A	Cos I
C	yeah
A	and gluing it back on
C	it's really nice
A	hmm
C	it's really pretty and very nice
A	very nice
C	okay
A	I want to just snuggle up on into bed but then I know I won't get up and get in the shower and I didn't get in the shower
C	hmm
A	so definitely need to wash
C	hmm
A	oh
C	went back to bed after midnight
A	def yeah well I fell asleep this afternoon didn't I? Just watching TV just sleeping on me
C	uh hmm
A	yeah
C	hmm
A	but
C	hmm
A	Cos definitely not I have no bum at all
C	hmm
A	um then he was like oh you're pretty confident
C	hmm
A	but even before and I was like oh yeah and he said um he was like or maybe an eight maybe an eight and a half definitely I would give your boobs a ten though
C	really?
A	yeah and do you know I get that quite a lot from from guys?
C	hmm
C	hmm
A	which is is a nice thing to hear
C	hmm
A	Cos these are boobs
C	hmm
A	like really
C	there's nothing you can do about them
A	no
C	hmm
A	so it was quite  it was quite  a bit of a hmm
C	hmm
A	so that's nice
C	yeah
A	that's was like a definitely an ego boost
C	yeah a confident boost
A	an ego boost
C	hmm
A	after uh
C	hmm
A	so that was pretty good
C	yeah
C	hmm
A	I think
C	hmm
A	hmm
C	with all the
A	with all the
C	hmm
A	hmm
C	in other words it's quite nice isn't it? Cos you don't get to talk all the time when you do go and you run into him
A	yeah and it means that
A	the only thing is the only thing I'm concerned about is I didn't does he I didn't know that he was friends with those lot
C	oh
A	and so
C	with them or something?
A	yeah
C	I don't think he will
A	yeah
C	you can't ever have sex with him again
A	no
C	you won't even if you can't have sex with
A	no
C	yeah
A	I'm pre warning you
C	uh hmm
A	make sure you do not tell
C	hmm
A	the ones you've slept with
C	I mean I don't know if blokes do that though
A	Cos they obviously know that I've slept with him
C	do blokes do that?
A	well they knew because when we were when I was about to leave I got a message saying where you know where did you go? And I was like I'm still in the pub
C	hmm and it's not like he came over and spoke to you
A	well he did try
C	did he?
C	did you just ignore him?
A	no
C	hmm
A	yeah
C	that's really embarrassing isn't it? Yeah
A	yeah because
C	oh really?
A	no
C	I slept with his cock
A	I certainly did that
C	yeah
A	um but the guys that he had sat with
C	hmm
A	like I know
C	hmm
A	and his mates again twice when he fucking saw that I was out there and I thought like hmm you know what I'm going to do I've going to talk to you
C	oh okay
A	so they all kinda know each other
C	hmm it's quite tenuous though
A	yeah
C	hmm
A	but I don't really know them very much but they they know me
C	hmm
A	if I see them in the pub I say hello and I run then I don't speak to them again unless I'm really fucked because I don't know them
C	hmm
A	and he was sat with them which is the link between
C	hmm
A	and he was like I know exactly who you're asking about and I was like so are you going to answer my question? He was just winding me up and he was like and I know why you're asking and I said do you now? And he was like yeah and he's got a massive smirk on his face and I was like well I don't know what you're talking about
C	hmm
A	so and he was like yeah whatever thinking it was funny and I'm thinking why would you do that?
C	hmm
A	why would you do that?
C	hmm
A	but it's obviously cos I was
C	hmm
A	I said well I don't
C	hmm
A	and I don't live in the village I'll come up every few weeks to catch up with my friends and that's it
C	hmm
A	Cos I'm making a massive deal about you've got a passport to get on
C	hmm
A	but I don't want him to go back cos
C	hmm
A	I just that's fine they cannot know the details
C	no I don't think anyone's going to know I mean unless he's a massive knob like he might enjoy the fact that oh yeah I bedded her because they A they all know you
A	hmm
C	and like not brag about it but just be like yeah well you're you
A	that's right yeah
C	but they will probably unless they're a complete knob to not divulging your darkest secrets
A	yeah
C	Cos it reflects on them as well
A	yeah
C	right
A	I know
B	no
A	oh
B	I'm not going to be there on seventh and I'm not going to be
C	well why would you be
B	just on after seven
C	why don't you just give her a text that you'll go round on tomorrow cos the weather's shit?
B	no she's busy tomorrow
C	okay
B	and so I said or I'll come round tomorrow when you haven't got your kids
C	hmm
B	Cos she said no it's either tonight or Wednesday
C	it's pretty bad out there though
A	hmm
B	it's alright
C	it's not far is it?
B	no
C	on a bus
B	I can't be late
A	hmm
C	I've got more wine in the cupboard
C	it's the weekend
B	it is
B	it is also a
C	for some people
C	not me
B	really?
C	um
A	oh
C	should we just open it up and see
A	let's crack it and see
C	nice
A	might be just be like the port now eh?
C	port
A	anybody? Yeah so in fact I
C	oh yeah
A	message gone
C	fine
B	is this the
C	no
A	no
C	oh sorry love
A	what?
C	oh I was going to answer on your behalf when you left the room
A	oh
C	then you responded
A	um no no this is
B	I don't know any
B	oh yeah yeah
C	blonde child
A	the blonde child
C	very attractive blonde
A	hmm
A	I mean not that I can't remember the people
B	oh no I've got one
A	jeez I thought you were going to go out there
B	well I've got to go out there in a bit anyway I'll just get my coat
A	yeah
A	yeah
C	overruled
A	yeah
C	the complete package
A	right as a person he's a complete package
C	well you had you did get to know Matt number one whereas Matt number two you were refusing to get to know
A	well the
C	for a good reason
A	I know Matt number two
C	hmm
A	but you know I was told no go out with him answer it
C	hmm
A	um he was just it was he reminded me of kind of teenage conversation?
B	uh hmm
C	yeah
A	do you know what I mean? Like I could never spend a lot of time with him
C	no
A	no
C	oh
A	but not as thick
C	David I mean David he's pretty spesh
A	yeah he's pretty spesh
C	but he's really hot
A	hmm
C	hmm
A	pretty buff
C	I mean you could tell that in his little cardigan couldn't you?
A	hmm
C	hmm
A	football
C	ah
A	yeah you'd think
C	so he must have hit the gym then
B	uh hmm
C	a lot of work out
A	hmm
A	yeah
C	he just had they just it was quite fortunate
A	hmm
C	I mean really they just got that built
A	yeah
C	the Big Question?
A	the Big Question which is a killer really
C	yeah
A	Cos you like that don't you?
C	yeah
A	you like that bit of a niceness
C	it's pretty low I mean it's quite nice there was no sort of uh well pff it's nine AM probably time for you to get your knickers on
A	yeah
C	and get out
A	hmm
C	but she's got a stinking cold so
A	nice
C	so in my head it's more like right well I've got to leave by lunch time probably and then she text me and said oh no I've I'm too poorly so then I was like well I haven't really got any plans because but you know I've got to get out so right two o'clock afterwards we stayed out of the rain together
A	yes
C	and the day before I was like okay it's a bit weird now maybe we should not be doing the couple thing
A	yeah
C	the more time you spend with someone the more you get to know them the more you care for them like
A	yeah even just in a conversation with someone
C	yeah
A	even if you just spend more time in a conversation with someone you automatically
C	hmm
A	without wanting to
C	it's quite an attachment
A	and you see which bits who touched who
C	uh hmm
A	yeah
C	it is hard and I think cos even the first time I met him when I was noticing that he was quite skinny and he was saying things that alarmed me
A	yeah
C	you know
A	yeah
C	what spurs them on and he said yeah I know  I know  it does sound a bit wrong and yeah I am trying you know and I think he really took it to heart which I didn't realise at the time like you say these things and you just think people don't hear your comments
A	yeah
C	and it's more because you don't him describing it that way worried me cos I thought it sounds like you might be verging on having a problem and he said well I do know because I'm aware that I'm aware of it you know because it's not like I don't see it
A	hmm
C	he was talking about his kids and he was like you know I can't have them here and would it be nice to sort of meet and whatever
A	yeah
C	um so yeah I do it feels good to know him
A	hmm
C	but we'll see
A	yeah
C	hmm
A	then the more secure you'll be in your decision as to whether you want to pursue this as a date situation
C	possibly it could be
A	or whether you want to keep it as a friends with benefits situation
C	yeah
A	but right now I don't think there's any any disadvantage to keeping him at arm's length on it
C	yeah
A	until you're sure before you take the
C	yeah
A	do you know what I mean?
C	I mean because really this is what always happens like when I was with
A	should I get my fleece
C	okay
A	I'm freezing
C	um yeah from the off we both said no we're not looking for anything and so he does really nice things
A	hmm
C	but you inevitably you are spending a lot of time with one person that
A	yeah
C	or you know you just  you just  don't wanna I don't wanna really sit in a position where I let myself start thinking oh maybe he is interested and then I tell him and be like
A	hmm
C	a girlfriend?
A	yeah
C	so um I guess it's just a case of taking it at face value
A	yup
C	it's always a bit of a challenge
A	which do you know what I think? In each relationship there's always one crazy one
C	yeah
A	do you know what I think? There's always one crazy one
C	yeah and invariably it's me
A	well no it's
C	I mean I have met a few crazy blokes in my time let's be honest Doctor Phil
A	I think
C	yeah
A	I think he probably had more craziness in him
C	yeah
A	and I think the crazy person shifts as well
C	yeah
A	like initially with with
C	hmm
A	Cos I was like really like him
C	yeah
A	which in hindsight was very intense and actually really unlike me but maybe that is because I'd just finished things with
C	possibly but then he was giving you the signs for you to do that
A	hmm
C	like you would have never had done that had he not encouraged it
A	no
C	he was saying all the stuff that you know I want you to be my girlfriend
A	hmm
C	and then he went mental
C	and then you realised that he was the mental one all along
A	yes
C	and you just get on with him so well
A	hmm
C	hmm
A	say hi hope you had fun the other night um I know lads will be lads but please don't mention details to anyone
C	yeah
A	that's enough isn't it?
C	that's it
A	gone
C	that's fine
A	oh shit
C	oh oh
A	yeah
C	that's dangerous
A	I know
C	life on the edge
A	what?
C	I know
A	yeah
C	completely
A	yeah
C	one of them has done it and forgot it or
A	one of them should own up before you start you know accusing people of breaking and entering
C	possibly
A	probably
C	yeah
A	probably wise
C	is it?
A	I put it on this afternoon it's already
C	oh
A	shit look at that
C	pretty shame
A	huh
C	oh bastards
A	bloody bastards  bloody bastards  has
A	no idea  no idea
A	no
C	but in the short term
A	yeah
C	he did say he was collecting a bag so yeah I suppose that's
A	I think
C	so yeah so
A	oh are you preparing?
B	I haven't been
C	have you em brushed your teeth?
B	not since the
A	hmm
B	I don't give a shit what she thinks
A	are you taking
B	I'm not taking it I know I'm going out
A	fair enough
B	uh yeah
C	yeah
A	yeah
B	I'm going to need it
A	I'd go for hi bye and run if it was me
C	hmm
B	I would
A	Good luck
C	see you soon
B	bye
A	why is he taking the tea towel with him?
C	to wipe off his bike I think
A	oh
C	Wise taking the tea towel
A	hmm
C	hi
A	hi
A	yes so
B	oh
A	bye
C	uh hmm
A	and
C	yeah
A	hmm
C	or
A	and
C	this is part of the I don't trust
A	maybe
C	or is it just an
A	or maybe it's I love I don't want
C	yeah
A	which is also ah
C	hmm
A	talk to you never
C	never yeah
A	unless you're pregnant
C	but he loves her?
A	what
C	doesn't he? Yeah cos he loved her but you say it
A	this crazy girl
C	because it's the right thing to say doesn't he?
A	yeah
C	he thinks that that's what is a good person would do and you think
A	yeah
C	what's the fucking matter with you?
A	so if the crazy girl says yeah I'm in a sprug he's going to go great
C	let's go tell her but she's the one who says she doesn't want to
A	yeah
C	I mean it does uh it does worry me that there are quite as many crazy ladies
A	hmm
C	to some varying degree but let's say that we're not totally fucking blimey
A	no we're not
C	in fact
A	nah I'm enjoying
C	um
A	hmm
C	so they
A	it's not the same as
C	it's always time for
A	hmm
C	because he had a break down
C	and she's they had a massive row
A	oh my God
C	she's laughing at him because she knows exactly how to push his buttons in
A	what a dick
C	what a dick
A	what?
C	yeah
A	oh my God
C	the whole time about being on the pill
A	oh my good gosh
C	yes they never got back together
A	yeah
C	he thinks she's a fucking psycho
A	well
C	yeah but then he was like uh it's all her fault and I was like well you could have used a Johnny to be fair
A	yeah
C	and he was like yeah well I never did you know yeah point taken while we were together for a while we never did
A	yeah
C	that she was on the pill
A	well yeah
C	I suppose you would really
A	yeah
C	if they leave they're it's game over really
A	they're the bad person really
C	yeah
A	and that's the end of that
C	they only see their kids once a month
A	yeah
C	um
A	yeah
C	but yeah it is
A	and you were saying he was getting custody of one of them?
C	he's getting custody of the son eventually he will get custody of all of them but where he lives now they've been told they can't even have the kids to visit
A	no
C	and he said when he'd had the kids around before and someone shocked him they called the agency and the agency like a representative came round and said you can't have kids there
A	out
C	with them
A	hmm
C	I never realised it was
A	that's a lot
C	so he's moving somewhere else
A	that's a lot to take on
C	hmm
A	outside all day
C	yeah
A	more financially and
A	hmm
C	you know he's ultimately it's about the kids isn't it?
A	yeah that's it why not be?
C	if the kids aren't getting a good upbringing
A	yeah
C	with the wife?
A	yeah
C	then or ex wife whatever she is
A	yeah like I'm not saying automatically go to house and
C	the short term
A	what's going to be best for them
C	yeah
A	then
C	exactly
A	that's what it's there for isn't it really?
C	yeah
C	the
A	is he packed?
C	no
C	so at the moment he's squatting in his humble house his skin is giving him some sort of weird allergic reaction
A	he's squatting in his own house?
C	yeah which again
A	hmm
C	normal
A	I mean and he has thought about worst case scenario
C	umm I don't think he's thought that far ahead
A	yeah?
C	um but
A	yeah
C	go down that road
A	yeah
C	and uh I mean unless he's literally on the streets
A	if he comes to that point yeah of
C	I'm not going to see anyone on the street are you? I mean I don't want to sort of go down that road ruse
A	you don't want to offer that as an option
C	no
A	until he gets to the point of he's like shit and then you say okay then
C	exactly
A	yeah
C	he's out there you think God yeah she's getting physically abused at home
A	yeah
C	I suppose maybe she wasn't telling him the full
A	no she wasn't
A	and fooled the doctor's there as well
C	hmm
A	yeah
C	fuck
A	yeah
C	I thought it's cos she didn't want to report her mum
A	hmm
C	I thought she didn't have a police
A	yeah
C	notice to show that is what it was yeah
A	she had police reports against him on but she hadn't pressed charges that's the only thing she didn't do
C	God
A	yeah
C	really mental
A	hmm
C	because the mum's totally unstable
A	his point of view
C	and all I get is his perspective so all of it I was hoping just so I'm not going to question him
A	hmm
C	yes
A	you just kind of uh you agree don't ya?
A	go along with it
C	and in your head you're going what the fuck?
A	wow
C	but um it's weird
A	oh?
C	umm so yeah I think thinking that
A	there's shit loads of jobs for it
C	yeah
A	load and loads and loads
C	yeah
A	every time I used to get emails online like
C	uh hmm
A	twenty percent of all the jobs
C	hmm
A	were fitness instructors
C	absolutely
A	yep
C	that actually is and he'll be laughing and he obviously like his job is like Craig's if the weather is shit he can't work cos it's really unstable and he's
A	and the extra
C	and he's got kids
A	fitness instructor without a gym in near near
C	oh yeah
A	not that I've seen him for about four years
C	oh
A	yes
C	why?
A	it's just a silly name from uni cos he used that word a lot
C	ha
A	but his name's
C	hmm
A	Cos I can't really gauge what he's going to be like now
C	uh hmm
A	he's very friendly
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	or be a private instructor
A	hmm
C	then you have to advertise yourself
A	yeah
C	and I think that's for him
A	and it's full time
C	it's partly the issue
A	and it's still going to be a irregular
C	exactly
A	yeah
C	unless it's an emergency but any kind of job where you're self employed
A	no
C	or if you've got a kiddie
A	God
A	pop pop pop pop pop there's all this goodness coming out
C	I don't know it's quite difficult to tell isn't it?
A	yeah
C	Cos he seems like a genuine person which is quite nice but there's no sort of
A	and quite rare
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	there's nothing hidden with him
A	that's so refreshing
C	yeah
A	hmm
C	he doesn't hide anything which I find quite refreshing
A	yeah
C	I suppose where the mind goes
A	that's what you need though isn't it?
C	uh hmm
A	like I don't really I think uh I was a bit naive because I've never really entertained any idea of a boy
C	hmm
A	at all before
C	hmm
A	apart from
C	hmm
A	we saw each other for a
C	hmm
A	and lived in each other's pockets
C	uh hmm
A	you know he would always invite me to go down and stay
C	Short term
A	yeah
C	hmm
A	we both signed up for that
C	hmm
A	but cos he was
C	hmm
A	that I mean
C	hmm
A	till being twenty-two
C	hmm
A	which is quite a long time for a friends with benefits situation
C	yeah
A	well he did but he was cheap
C	right
A	and I never slept with him while he was with her but they were on and off a bit like this Jeremy Kyle thing
C	hmm
A	full of himself
C	right
A	but in the way that I knew  I knew  him and it wasn't actually true
C	okay
A	and if he tried to pull it I'd just knock him down a pick or two
C	yeah
A	cos we've known each other since we were about thirteen
C	aaw that's quite cute
A	yeah
C	not a problem
A	not a problem at all
C	crazy knob
A	hmm
C	uh huh
A	most boys the majority were pretty standard as the boys that I've known that I've grown up with cos all my friends have always been boys
C	hmm
A	apart from a small group of girls like literally now
C	hmm
A	um so I'd I kinda just thought that lads are much easier to read than girls
C	yeah
A	with boys and in girls you get this Jeze gonna have a baby
C	yeah
A	craziness
C	yeah
A	to kind of
C	hmm
A	and uh that's quite a massive difference but with boys I always kinda thought it was a a smaller
C	A smaller variation
A	yeah
C	uh hmm
A	no
[ANNOTATION]	Jeze have a baby	Entailment
C	see I don't know if it's them getting older or what it is but I think you know as soon as someone been
A	hmm
C	I think you
A	come more to a logical plane
C	yeah
A	uh hmm
C	the possibility of finding somebody and then blokes see it as carte blanche well I can shag whoever I like now because I'm single and I can do it if I like
[ANNOTATION]	person C looking for someone	Neutral
A	uh hmm
C	I think that's an element of not really giving a fuck and I think that's the problem
A	yeah
C	and then they  then they  can say whatever they like
A	and do whatever they want
C	and so for a moment they will be like yeah of course I really like you then they'll be you know distant again so
A	uh hmm
C	I think I've just had such a long run starting with the Norwegian in Cuba after a very quick breaking up with Will
A	yeah
C	he was the one who was referring to me as a girlfriend when I was I went up to Norway to break up with him and then realised actually I quite liked him
A	hmm
C	umm
[ANNOTATION]	person C don't	Neutral
A	choice timing
C	yes that's when I realised that karma was a bitch like
A	yep but I saw right since then
C	exactly
A	I've done a lot of digging round of talk and he was actually wrong
C	he is
A	in fact
C	you've got to remember
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	person C don't know girlfriend	Contradiction
C	how to
A	have you read
[ANNOTATION]	person A remember	Entailment
C	no I just thought it was a bit cheesy
A	read it
C	is it really cheesy?
A	it's quite cheesy but it's really really truthful
C	okay
A	like it's not written as a I thought it would be quite written like a fictional novel would be
C	oh
A	it's not at all it more written like a handbook
[ANNOTATION]	person A is talking about university	Contradiction
C	yeah
A	um
C	well it's a self help book isn't it essentially?
A	yeah
C	that's how they market it
A	hmm
C	you can't get away from that
A	hmm
C	though I doubt that many men will read it
A	I made Jordan read it
C	through choice
A	I made him read it cos we were just getting on each other's wicks so much at one point
C	hmm
A	I was like do you know what? Fuck this
C	yeah
A	if this is what we actually want to do
C	yeah
A	and it helped on a lot
C	well that's good
A	hmm
C	no I don't think that they are I think that's probably what annoys me is that these books talk about women things like He's Just Not That Into You
A	oh did it?
C	book
A	hmm
C	um and knowing how to read them and I think it's you probably useful in a it's probably interesting to work out how to read what other people think generally
A	hmm
C	but this idea that it's targeted women who want to find a husband
A	oh no
C	okay
A	so it was quite nice cos I was quite shocked by some of it like
C	oh really?
A	all the time
C	okay
A	and also like if women have a problem it's annoying the way it's written cos it like on Venus women are like this and you think cut the crap
C	hmm
A	you know
C	hmm
A	and to kind of reinforce that yeah that was crazy and but you were right though and do you want a drink and you know and that's it
C	hmm
A	whereas if you go home you say that to your other half he's going to give you solutions well you should have done this
C	hmm
A	and I used to get so angry with Jordan
C	hmm
A	well why don't you do this? Well no cos that wouldn't work because this
C	hmm
A	that she was emotionally this this this
C	hmm
A	Cos I'm Mars
C	hmm
A	done
C	yeah
A	whereas that's not what the woman wanted at all
C	yeah just emotional support
A	from that conversation
C	hmm
A	yeah and it says that they're like if if a guy has a problem it's not that he won't talk about it because he doesn't want to but a man's brain in order to find the solution won't bounce ideas
C	hmm?
A	their brain is programmed not to bounce ideas and they their their brain is basically made to self consult
C	oh okay
A	so the guy will be really quiet and go into his cave
C	okay
A	which is what they say
C	hmm
A	and will do you want me move to this table a little bit?
C	that's alright I'm just gonna lean against the radiator a little bit
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	um yeah basically they self consult until they can find the solution
C	hmm
A	faced with a problem they
C	it's quite logical isn't it?
A	yeah
C	hmm
A	but if you try and talk to her him
C	hmm
A	while he's in that that process then he will want you to fuck off
C	really?
A	he will actually want you to fuck off
C	hmm
C	oh really?
A	because the fact that he the fact that you would ask that implants that
C	you don't
A	you think he requires help
C	he's incapable of it
A	one
C	hmm
A	three
C	hmm
A	Cos he's a man that's what he should be able to do
C	oh yeah
A	so basically he'll just  himself up until he gets to that solution
C	oh
A	which is
C	but what did you say I mean like men put it this on a bookcase for example like if you tried to offer any help
A	hmm
C	no
A	yeah
C	directions? Should we ask for help? No
A	no
C	I know where I'm going
A	yeah
C	we'll just go round again shall we?
A	like extreme version of it and uh
C	hmm
C	hmm
A	was we were just reading each other really differently and then it gives you like a list of you say he hears he says you hear idea
C	hmm
A	um and a lot  a lot  of our arguments were resolved because instead of thinking that's not what I meant
C	uh hmm
A	we started more along the lines of thinking that's not how I intended you to receive it
C	hmm
A	so it was more about it doesn't matter whether you meant it or not or whether you meant it to come across like that
C	hmm
A	is more valid
C	hmm
A	than how you intended to say it
C	absolutely
A	and so
C	but that's quite an interesting point isn't it? It's like when
A	yeah
C	or you're being over sensitive and you think well but that's how I feel like why can't you understand
A	yeah
C	that that's how I feel? Like you saying those words makes me feel this big
A	there's a whole part there there's a whole chapter in the book
C	hmm
A	about don't invalidate her feelings
C	ah
A	Cos men men do this they've had this exact conversation
C	hmm
A	except when we hear them say and I didn't mean it like that or don't be daft you know
C	yeah
A	I'm thinking I'm not stupid
C	yeah
A	because they don't realise that actually what they're making you feel is that you're because you're feeling that way it's not a valid
C	yeah
A	it's not valid and it makes you feel like this this big
C	yeah and you're in the wrong
A	yeah
C	and that's not okay
A	no
C	well that's interesting
A	I think everybody should be made to read it
C	that is really interesting cos I completely dismissed it out of hand
A	hmm
C	always
A	hmm
C	I just I never thought that it could help me
A	and it has even got
C	yeah so I'll do that
A	not a relationship wise because they've described
C	hmm
A	is is like a sea
C	hmm
A	so they'll be a calm and instead of a lull before the storm which is not quite accurate this guy was saying and I think that you'll have kind of a really good period in your life
C	hmm
A	and then that kind of peak drops so it kind of gets a bit better and then you know you're really have a great time you're feeling really good very confident and then something will some trigger and obviously everybody's triggers are different will happen and it won't even just be oh that's a bit bad
C	you'll just plummet
A	smash like a wave crashing and once you crash like that you have to kind of learn to get your head round the fact you
C	oh God
A	which is really it isn't a really strange thing to think of?
C	yeah absolutely
A	but it's also nice and in the comfort that those days when you're like holy crap
[ANNOTATION]	Something is similar to a mountain according to speaker A.	Contradiction
C	hmm
A	you know the world's ending
C	hmm
A	and you smash to the bottom and what you do is you automatically sort friends and opinions and talk through things
C	absolutely
A	that it was quite comforting especially with what I was going through at the time to know actually everybody does that
C	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	World's ending is also a Disney movie.	Neutral
C	hmm
A	and I think you also compare it to being at the bottom of a  of a  well
C	hmm
A	if you're  if you're  in the well
C	hmm
A	it's not  it's not  it's inevitable that the wave's going to come back up again
C	hmm
A	but women
C	uh hmm
[ANNOTATION]	Problems in life sometimes return.	Entailment
A	they're always quite
C	hmm
A	whereas a woman will always be very interactive
C	hmm
A	but whether she's on a real positive or a real negative is quite severe
C	wow
[ANNOTATION]	Women tend to be more extrovert than men.	Neutral
A	how weird is that?
C	yeah I mean it doesn't
A	yeah
C	and so you know you are going to pick yourself up and you are gonna the situation is going to improve itself
A	hmm
C	you know you things are going to get better
A	yeah
C	you know it's quite an encouraging thought
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	The situation will eventually be improved.	Entailment
C	that other women and other people have been in a similar situation and
A	yeah
C	it gets better
A	that's quite
C	I guess when you feel quite alone like a lot of the times and sort of reading it
A	hmm
C	from another perspective like being able to understand the person that you're with a lot more
[ANNOTATION]	There are no similarities between people's situations.	Contradiction
A	especially like if you're in a relationship and you know that really there's so much that goes on behind closed doors that you can't run by someone else
C	uh hmm
A	even if you wanted to
C	yeah
A	hmm
C	hmm
A	which I think was quite a which is where Samarra and I came into the if you ever want to get married then I'm going to come and live with you for three months
C	hmm
A	because she saw everything one first hand
C	hmm
A	which was quite difficult for her at some  at some  point
C	hmm
A	cos obviously she lived with us and you can't like get like distance
C	hmm
A	if we needed distance but Samarra and I are close enough that if that was the case we'd just go
C	you just know
A	to your room
C	hmm
A	yeah
C	hmm
A	I mean she's very much like she's we're like the same person cos I think when you start to mature
C	hmm
A	we we were maturing at the same time in the same surroundings living in each others pockets so inevitably you both kind of get bits of each other
C	yeah
A	but yeah
A	and sometimes I'd have to say which makes
C	hmm
A	and he's like oh yeah when it it feels a bit not very comfortable that you'd have to bring that up
C	hmm
A	when you really I'm thinking you've got a brain how did you not get to that yourself?
C	yeah
A	not that this book is like the be all and end all but in some situations they were kind of really stark stark comparisons
C	hmm
A	and he
C	yeah
A	you know everything's gospel
C	yeah
A	but
C	maybe I will
A	hmm
A	I used to read it and would just go to Samarra cos she was living with us at the time
C	no
A	you know if you say this to a boy this happens and this happens you know they're actually thinking this? And Jordan would sit there and go yeah
A	it was really strange like he would sit there and we would have this forum sometimes cos some of the stuff that I'd hear I was so shocked by
C	hmm
A	I was like what? No way and some of it Jordan got a bit upset by cos it was I think he thought of it as a personal attack
C	yeah
A	Cos he did that and I was like no no I'm not trying to say you're wrong for doing it you're obviously not look this is just how you're programmed but this is real news to me
C	hmm
A	real news
C	hmm
A	yeah
C	it helps you understand him I think because that's what's important
A	hmm
C	british Gas calling
C	no it's called Badoo
A	what's Badoo?
C	it's a
A	badoo
C	yeah I can show you pictures of
A	first some truth ones
C	okay
C	he looks a bit like a criminal
A	like that?
C	no
A	I don't really know
C	looking for my left and my right
A	ah
C	so he has face fuzz now
A	face fuzz
C	but he did say that he shaved it off cos the girl his little girls who were seven and ten said dad dad we can't kiss you with your
A	ah
C	yeah so he shaved it off
A	yeah he's a he's not what I imagined he's cute though isn't he?
C	it's he yeah I think he's cute and I think he's funny which obviously helps
A	yeah he is cute
C	I think he doesn't look like a criminal
A	what's it's?
C	um B um B A D so he's my
A	alright
C	my phone is
A	yeah
C	pretty standard
A	oh right
C	his interests writing screen plays photography spelled incorrectly
A	yeah
C	writing novels mixed martial arts
A	yeah that is
C	tradesman
A	Great
C	like
A	like
C	yeah
A	lies
C	I don't know if it's lies
A	oh
C	yeah
A	the if you do a three year degree HMDs and DO two
C	oh
A	Cos that's what
C	oh okay
A	so we did or I did GCSEs A Levels four year degree
C	yeah
A	Jordan did GCSEs college incorporating foundation degree H and D one year and topped it up to a degree
C	oh right
A	so usually if you do ah I don't know? Where did he I I I think the idea the split is if you do something that's more vocational or art based
C	hmm
A	like illustration or graphic design or health care that instead of doing A Levels people tend to do an MBQ
C	okay
A	which is I think MBQ Three is the same pitch as A Level
C	yeah
A	which although I was a snob and didn't believe it currently apparently that's true
C	like an MD and then HND
A	yes
C	hmm
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	you walk away with a diploma
C	yeah
A	you can actually which I think is like a failure I know it sounds awful but you never  you never  go to uni intending to walk away with a diploma do ya?
C	no
A	you don't
C	well no
A	but
C	like when you do a post graduate degree like if you do all of the modules without the dissertation you can get a diploma so you can get a post graduate diploma but you don't get a master's qualification
A	hmm
C	social yeah
A	I never knew what that was
C	it's a PG Dip so you get a post graduate diploma which just means that you've done all the course work and all the classes up until like main or whatever
A	that's what my friend
C	oh
A	he didn't really want a masters
C	yeah
A	and he just got it that's fine
C	so yeah if you're teaching that's all you need
A	hmm
C	so you wouldn't you don't spend the extra like six months doing it
A	hmm
C	unless you've felt like if as a sense of you're doing it for yourself
A	yeah
C	rather than it's what the need to have a vocation qualification which I think really my masters was a bit of both
A	me too
C	so I've got my transcripts cos this is when when I applied for my um MA and there's marks in the eighties and there's fails
A	me too yeah
C	across the board and my tutor Mister
A	aren't interested
C	like really struggling
A	yeah
C	and I think that's why I wouldn't go to university
A	yeah
C	because to come up with fifty grand worth of debt just isn't viable for a degree that it's very nice but means nothing to me
A	yeah
C	so when I went back I suppose it was a chance for me to prove that I could get a good degree and prove to others even though you don't need to
A	yeah
C	just thought you should
A	yeah
C	rather than to get a degree for the sake of it
A	yeah
C	to engage your brain again having worked in a shop for three years and it was great and I just I've just really really enjoyed it and been busy all the time and uh I spoke to my mum and I got up doing this and doing that we went to this and you know we're doing that and I'm going to the theatre tonight and you know cos my friend Al worked there so I stayed there all the time and could meet all the people backstage and it sounds very exciting it was a really exciting life and I guess when I moved to Cambridge it all stopped
A	hmm
C	is this it now?
A	is this what I was training for all this time?
C	hmm
A	is this what I'm given?
C	so I've come out with like eight grand worth of debt
A	yeah
C	um but it's a five year repayment plan from a hundred and fifty pounds a month
A	hmm
C	so I've only done two and a half years
A	I think it's manageable is it?
C	it's not a ridiculous amount but when you think you've got rent
A	I know
C	you've got student loan and food and
A	I'm paying
C	for the car?
A	yup
C	for how much longer?
A	I don't really know
C	hmm
A	I've been paying it back cos I bought the car October November December January February March
C	wow
A	I've been paying about what's that?
C	over a hundred and twenty-five pounds a month? You must be nearly there
A	for twelve months
C	if you think a hundred pounds a month
A	and she let me missed one you know
C	hmm
A	back at Christmas I didn't pay her on Christmas and she was like no that's fine
C	nice
A	she wouldn't let me pay
C	if it was a hundred
A	so
C	pounds a month it would be thirty months wouldn't it? Which is
A	yeah
C	twelve twenty-four fourteen so
A	so it's probably going to be two years
C	it's going to be two
A	and I'll probably pay it back in a year
C	two years
A	I'll probably be doing this for another year which is fine
C	hmm
A	uh um but also I owe my friend
C	uh hmm
A	well that didn't last
C	no
A	that was it
C	uh hmm
C	yeah
A	um but when I moved jobs remember when my bank account got all that thing with with the stupid lost my card
C	oh yeah
A	shit? And they stopped everything
C	oh right
A	and he just that's why I'm really pissed off with him
C	the money's not coming into my account
A	yeah
C	uh hmm
A	and I mean I didn't start paying it back straight away
C	yeah
A	so until
C	hmm
A	and which I was resentful for not only because he
C	hmm
A	he knows I'm taking home half of what he's taking home
C	hmm
A	and he's
C	hmm
A	which I
C	yeah
A	like I didn't now I wasn't still paying him
C	hmm
A	but it's more like he knows me  he knows me  very well and if I had known that he had a
C	yeah
A	I think but why would you not just say it to me?
C	yeah and and then just leave it so that he's getting annoyed more and more annoyed
A	yeah
C	rather than talking to you about it
A	yeah
C	and just finding out what's going on
A	yeah
C	so now he's getting riled unnecessarily
A	yeah
C	hmm
A	I mean I will anyway but
C	hmm
A	I'm kinda more like well hang on a sec you're pissed off with me because of a hundred pound a month?
C	hmm
A	um shouldn't I be pissed off with you over the fact that you're that much of a great friend like
C	you never called to find out why you couldn't repay
A	no
C	hmm
A	all in one go
C	hmm
A	exactly
C	hmm
A	as opposed to just focusing on a couple of hundred quid
C	hmm
A	which you don't actually need seeing as you're you've been on two holidays already this year
C	is he where is he living again?
A	Reading
C	oh
A	no
C	hmm
A	it's as far as were talking about four hundred pounds
C	hmm
A	perhaps it's my grasp on cash but
C	no I mean if he really needed it there's no way he would be going on holidays
A	and it's not just the odd holiday
C	hmm
A	since I've moved to
C	fuck
A	Madrid Berlin uh I think they went to  I think they went to  Paris for valentines
C	this is him and his fellow?
A	and his boyfriend
C	oh
C	hmm
A	it's he's got he's I saw on his Facebook he's been skiing
C	A fuck load because it when you get to the resort beer is like eight pounds a pint isn't it?
A	yeah
C	eight Euros a pint
A	yeah
C	hmm
A	actually on a friendship level you would have probably have said
C	yeah
A	forget four hundred quid
C	Cos yeah absolutely
A	no
C	Cos obviously he's been contacting you on Facebook isn't it?
A	hmm
C	so
A	and then um another thing that really annoyed me was he only let me know that this standing order wasn't going through mid last month
C	oh right
A	yeah
C	hmm
A	he was like well no I expected you didn't but I did send you a few messages and I didn't get a reply
C	hmm
A	and I said I lost my phone
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	if you're worried about someone if you're worried about a friend you haven't heard from in a few weeks and wasn't responding responding to your messages
A	yeah
C	would you not try every avenue?
A	and as of as a rule I'm sure he's actually got the phone number perhaps not this one but certainly the one before which I had before
C	oh yeah
A	so
C	okay
C	or would he have  would he have
A	yup
C	what?
A	even even got a message to
C	fuck
C	so that's a good six months
A	yeah
C	we've been here six months haven't we?
A	yeah
C	hmm
A	you know I'm really crap at keeping my friendships
C	yeah me too
A	you know I'll not speak to people for months at a time and they think I've disappeared off the face of the earth
C	hmm
C	that's so weird
A	I hope
C	because it was a you know gathering all this anger against you because the standing order which as you say if you did actually just bothered to get in contact you would understand why
A	yeah
C	and really if your other money is not coming through really you start to think okay well there's obviously been a bit of a problem I'm a bit short on cash
A	yeah
C	so if they didn't respond to a text you might think well a bit weird
A	yeah
A	yeah
C	might try and call
A	uh hmm
C	and he would think that's suspicious
A	I know
C	you know
A	yeah
C	no one has their phone off these days
A	yeah
C	what's going on?
A	so it's all very it's all been very weird
C	and that's really hurtful isn't it really?
A	yeah
C	that your friend is obsessed just seems to be a bit more concerned about the money
A	yes
C	than
A	that's the thing
C	your feelings
A	and I spoke to
C	really?
A	yeah
C	that's weird though
A	I mean we just put it down to the fact that he's just come out as being gay
C	hmm
A	and
C	hmm
A	and was partying up all the time and very much living that type of lifestyle
C	but the the fact that he's getting in contact with
A	hmm
C	someone's he's only friends with through you
A	yep
C	hmm
A	I don't know
C	fYI
A	oh
C	he's definitely gone in
A	oh
C	just slap and tickle
A	oh
C	I don't think she would shag him though
A	he sent a picture I saw a picture of her uh
C	oh yeah cos she said hi to me when she came round
C	well only cos she was in the door when I came out from my room
A	damn it
C	and she wouldn't come into the house
A	hmm
C	it felt weird like they were some sort of I don't know anyway
A	yeah
C	Paul's Boutique?
A	yeah I Love
C	hmm
A	I have hatred for this
C	yeah it's tacky as hell
A	tacky as hell and all the school kids have got kind of I Love
C	hmm
A	which are painted and a bit stuck on and
C	oh they're disgusting
A	fake gold
C	yeah
C	but then they're like sixty quid? Don't they sell them at Top Shop actually at
A	do they?
C	I'm sure
A	um maybe in the Oxford Street one
C	yeah
A	uh yeah
C	it's pretty  Yeah
A	um and he was saying she's got a new coat
C	I know
A	people buy clothing?
C	I couldn't buy coats
A	bags
C	bags
A	and purses are what I thought
C	hmm
A	while she's got a it wasn't a coat it was a hoodie
C	ah
A	so there's a picture of a stud right it's it's sent she'd sent to him in front of the mirror of course
C	hmm
A	so it's up to here black and none of this of course um all black and the emblem there right? And she stood taking a photograph like this
C	uh

C	so that's also quite dangerous
A	yeah
C	three times this week and don't eat

C	like no real major issues to speak of
A	which one? I find they're normally quite boring
C	have you seen the one where they go to Italy yet?
A	no
C	yeah you have to watch that one
A	the thing is I keep thinking to watch it but then like oh Larry uh
C	at
A	hmm
C	that's foolish yeah
A	I was thinking about getting a notebook you know?
C	hmm
A	like a really baby laptop
C	hmm
A	um
C	they're good you can't watch but you can't play dics on them
A	hmm
C	or anything cos they're that small
A	yeah cos and then I thought cos I'm going to get a new laptop or something like that
C	hmm
A	I should probably get one with a disk drive on it
C	you never know when it might come in handy
A	yeah
C	hmm
A	just like the basic one
C	yeah
A	um for a couple hundred quid
C	hmm
A	Cos I don't use it for I don't need it for anything particular anymore like uh when I was at uni I needed a disc one for the work and stuff like that
C	hmm
A	but now
C	hmm
A	literally Word internet
C	hmm
A	DVD done
C	yeah
A	so I do I'll have to get one before I go away anyway
C	yeah
A	you probably need to ask him how difficult that training was?
C	very difficult
A	oh God
C	cos he went in but not in as an
A	oh yeah they were only saying about this now
C	hmm
A	yeah
C	how bad it was
A	how much
C	yeah
A	oh
C	yeah
A	shit
C	because he was doing that when we worked at
A	yeah
C	none whatsoever
A	hmm
C	and sort of got one ahead of everybody else
A	yeah
C	hmm
A	umm was saying how easy he found the mechanical engineering bit and I was like
C	hmm
A	and how difficult he found the English bit and I was like no I found that bit the easiest it was the mechanical engineering bit that I found hard
C	hmm
A	and he was like oh yeah I have got an engineering degree though
C	well that will give you a heads up won't it? What an idiot
A	yeah
C	that sort of thing shouldn't be allowed really should it?
A	it's unfair
C	it's a massive
A	yeah
C	right
A	I have no answer
C	okay
A	and everybody that I've spoken to has said so why are you joining the navy? And I'm like well you know shits and giggles that's not gonna wash
C	no
A	so what we need to do is anybody who over here is joining the navy anybody
C	all these people that I actually know weirdly
A	say why did you join the navy? And we're going to steal one of their perfect answers
C	they've already done this
A	exactly
C	they're totally clued up
A	if I just take their fake answer
C	hmm
A	I think that's fine
C	okay
A	Cos there's no real reason
C	hmm
A	it's a big team unit which I love
C	yeah
A	Cos everywhere I've worked before the ethos between the people is so stretched that I feel like
C	hmm
A	but um
C	probably not going to say that
A	probably not  probably not  going to wash when it comes to it
C	no
A	yeah
C	you know you just make it up on the day don't you?
A	yeah but when you've got two days
C	that's
A	and not an hour
C	it's pretty intense
C	yeah
A	um cos the pay is shit?
C	you don't say that
A	yes not varied enough and also it's computer I mean computers
C	say you're more of a people person
A	I'm more of a
C	hmm
A	which is true
C	oh yeah
A	and so the day after I said I don't know why but I get really impatient cos I really get there
C	hmm
A	quite quickly
C	hmm
A	really that's true
C	hmm
A	and it's not  it's not  really a whole truth because
C	oh
A	hmm
C	it's easy to see it sometimes but not always so
A	but you know the more people we speak to I know Jake was in the navy the guy that uh
C	yeah
A	yup
C	on the page
A	yeah
C	and who was the cute one?
C	oh
C	for the best I think
A	yeah
C	so he wouldn't get interfered with by fake flowers
A	yeah so I probably just need to just suck fake answers from everyone
C	okay well that's fine
A	so that's the plan
C	I can sniff a brief
A	yeah
C	fine
A	that's a brief
C	yeah
A	just ask them all why did you join navy?
C	uh hmm
A	yes
C	okay
A	I'll do that
C	bud
