A	cos I I didn't know it was on you see and erm
B	well we we were told by the guy who runs
A	right and I
B	and he told us
A	hadn't twigged that
B	he told us to turn up on the square
A	right
B	at quarter to ten
A	right
B	which we duly did
A	right
B	so off we went to the school erm and we got to the school and it there was just masses of people
A	yeah
B	we thought oh
A	yeah no like
B	er
A	it's totally
A	bewildering because it was like I went up there about three erm no no no I was gonna go up there for about three no that's right that's what
B	mm
A	friend of mine they had been
B	mm
A	it was kind of like four hundred five hundred people
B	hello?
A	yeah so she said it
A	it was amazing like and she said they were all wandering around like sheep trying to find this waterfall
B	well they'd done two waterfalls there er it was absolutely impossible to photograph them cos they were just full of people
A	yeah yeah
B	erm but now I know where they are I can drive to the
A	yeah okay great
B	and take pictures
A	yeah well that's right I mean
B	well
A	yeah
B	you come to the sort of curve where the same builder that built these houses has got another sort of five or six
A	yeah
B	and one of them has got no windows in it but the road does a very sharp turn
A	yes I know where you mean yeah
B	yeah? well if you go up that road there
A	yeah
B	you come to the next very sharp right hand turn
A	yeah yeah yeah yeah
B	and there's an an old walnut tree on the side of the road
A	okay
B	and there's a riverbed there well that I can't remember  if it's actually flowing now
A	oh right
B	and if you go across the river
A	yeah
B	erm
A	little stream yeah
B	er and then walk up
A	yeah
B	about a hundred and fifty yards up
A	yeah
B	there's a waterfall it's only about three metres
A	yeah yeah
B	but it's pretty
A	it's pretty and it's
B	er
A	a waterfall
B	and there's lots of wild
A	yeah
B	orchids and tulips and things there
A	oh beautiful
B	erm very pretty
A	yeah
B	but I don't think most of them saw it and most of them were
A	yeah
B	by the masses
A	so kind of a good idea but
B	yeah
A	but maybe control the amount of people next time yeah split
B	and then er
A	up into a morning and afternoon thing
B	we went back down erm there were two ways you could either walk back down the road and turn left or you just went up the hill a little bit
A	mm
B	and then cut back down a dirt track
A	okay
B	erm
A	yeah
B	and you went to
A	right
B	and you have to cut across this river and then up a bloody steep hill I mean it was like almost
A	right
B	kind of like
B	I'm gonna die
B	erm rope me up
A	yeah
B	er erm
B	you get to the top of this and then you have to go down the other side of this hill which was also quite steep and you were sort of scrambling down there
A	right
B	and then er if you turned left up that big valley
A	yeah
B	there was another waterfall
A	oh wow
B	erm
A	yeah but
B	in in
A	kind of
B	in the UK
A	interesting
B	the walks are
A	well no but here I guess waterfalls are quite something because
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	er erm when I went to see Karsiyaka pond and they'd planted all those trees en route and
A	oh
B	erm
A	that's nice
B	oh yeah er water and coffee for sale at all the stops
A	yeah
B	that I had there
A	yeah yeah
B	and they provided Dixi cabins so people could go to the toilet on the
A	yeah
A	yeah so it was a well
B	mm
A	organised
B	mm
A	thing
B	mm and
A	oh you're joking me
B	and it stuck with them there and nobody could
A	oh no how frustrating
B	yes it is
A	yet so far
B	your Cypriot
A	yes
B	organisation
A	yeah
B	it's ought to do do you take sugar?
A	no thanks just a bit of milk will be good thanks
B	that was so
A	yeah
B	yeah I mean they did it last year and I missed it
A	right so you wanted to do it
B	erm
A	this year yeah
B	er and I thought well I'll do it this year and
A	yeah
B	see what it's like I mean we met loads of different people there and
A	yeah
B	erm
A	it's quite a walking kind of community here it seems that
B	yeah er
A	people do really like to get out
B	the problem the problem I find here is that it's a walking kind of community but they don't see anything
A	mm mm
B	you go there and you say have you seen the local orchids and they look at you and go what?
A	mm
B	look at that that's an orchid
A	yeah
B	mm
A	wanna take it in
B	erm you know have you seen this lump of stone here? this is bronze age this is a such and such it's part of a mill
A	yeah
B	okay
B	yeah okay yeah
A	yeah
B	so?
B	what's bronze age?
B	and you go
B	god I think
A	you just wanna download some information into their heads so
B	so yeah
A	they can kind of enjoy it a bit more
B	I mean it
A	yeah
B	just frustrates me
A	yeah do do you find that with the Cypriots then mostly do you mean?
B	yeah
A	that they are
B	no I mean so
A	they're not
B	the Turks have got no fucking idea whatsoever
A	yeah yeah
B	they don't
A	yeah yeah
B	un fucking believable
A	yeah
B	two years two years ago October? no yeah two years ago October
A	mm
B	we went up to erm the Karpass
A	uhu
B	without GPS then and I'd do
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	running around and
B	and
A	oh
B	maps
A	right yeah
B	which are illegal here by the way
A	yeah I can imagine
B	you're
A	yeah yeah yeah yeah
B	but they're literally so detailed you've got every bloody tree on the island
A	wow
B	well well they've died since but
A	yeah but you
B	erm
A	that's how detailed they were
B	and they've got Roman individual graves and Bronze Age graves
A	wow
B	of tumuli and whatever on them
A	wow
B	and they're fascinating documents
A	yeah yeah brilliant who did all of those then? the army?
B	the
A	the British army?
B	er Royal Engineers
A	the Royal Engineers yeah
B	and erm
B	erm but officially you know you can't get hold of them and yet the University of Berkeley in California has got them in their library and you can actually pay and get
A	get them
B	copies
A	yeah
B	downloaded to be printed
A	the University
B	which is
A	of Berkeley?
B	weird
A	and for yeah
B	erm how they get to the University of Berkeley library I have no idea
A	mm
B	anyway we found this place called Knidos
A	uhu
B	marked on the map
A	uhu
B	er tell a lie
A	right
B	you know it was somewhere or other after
A	yeah
B	the Phoenicians
A	yeah
B	and there was a harbour there and a big settlement and a big necropolis
A	yeah
B	beautiful little place
A	yeah
B	so we sat down
A	yeah
B	we ended up
A	yeah
B	Knidos
A	yeah
B	er
B	yeah well according to the map we've got it's here
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	talking about yeah
B	and all you got was well we're not from here we're from Van or we're from erm Mersin or we're from
A	yeah okay
B	somewhere or other
A	yeah so it's a Turkish
B	yeah so well you've never
A	yeah
B	been down to the coastline and had a look for this thing?
A	mm
B	why?
A	yeah yeah doesn't interest them
B	so we drove up into the countryside and we drove off road for about oh I don't know
A	right okay
B	across
A	off the beaten then?
B	mm well it wasn't a
A	yeah
B	track
A	oh right you just were
B	it was just
B	this was a mark
A	yeah
A	right
B	there was occasional some hunters' tracks every now and again and you'd find a can of
A	yeah
B	shotgun cartridges
A	yeah
B	and that was
A	yeah that was it
B	about the only sign of civilisation you found and we got to the place where we couldn't go any further there was a big high bunch of thorny
A	oh right
A	yeah
B	erm
A	yeah you're not going to try and go through there yeah
B	er not to go without the right car
A	yeah
B	and the erm
A	mm
B	just looking at the valley I said there there's steps going in the floor of that valley
A	wow
B	look
A	yeah
B	and on the way down there were all these holes er about
A	wow
B	that people had robbed graves that were in the cliff side
A	right
B	there must have been a couple of hundred of these and they were all
A	wow
B	freshly dug up
A	no
B	er and they'd all been plundered and you looked down these holes and you could see that they I mean
A	yeah
B	that goes into a sideways
A	yeah
B	cave
A	yeah yeah okay yeah
B	in the cliff
A	yeah
B	and that's where they put the body and the
A	yeah
B	grave goods and stuff like that
A	yeah
B	and er we get down and you can see the floor plans of these houses had been cut into the basic rock
A	yeah
B	and then obviously had had walls built up on the outside of the walls
A	yeah right yeah
B	long gone I mean they're about three and half thousand years BC
A	oh wow
B	and er so we eventually found er a track that went around this
A	mm wow
B	and
A	great stuff
B	drove
A	yeah
B	across and found I don't have you ever been to the Salamis tombs of the kings?
A	the what? the one up the way?
B	no these ones are on by er by Famagusta
A	no I haven't yet
B	at Salamis around there
A	I haven't been there yet
B	well they've got a a whole series of graves there that they've dug up the sort of noble part of the local cemetery
A	uhu
B	well they're not kings' graves by any stretch of the imagination but they must have been pretty rich noblemen
A	uhu
B	or businessmen erm and some of the designs are of a typical erm archaic period design where you had a a ramp that went down
A	mm
B	normally quite funnel shaped there was large steps going down
A	mm
B	and then a square portico
A	uhu
B	going into a hole in the ground where
A	mm
B	the burial chamber was
A	yeah yeah
B	and we're going along and we're driving through the I mean this absolute wilderness
A	yeah
B	and there's these piles of stones like domes
A	right wow
B	and we're thinking what the hell are these things?
A	yeah what are they doing there? yeah
B	and a few people have tried pulling them apart where you can see they'd been ripped apart there's nothing inside them
A	oh right
B	they're just like
A	just domes
B	just domes of stones
A	yeah
B	they're not even hollow they're solid
A	yeah yeah
B	probably people on the farms had just put them there to get them out of the fields
A	right yeah
B	you know except there's no fields
A	right okay yeah
B	and we're parked having a look at these stones and I suddenly see right next to me hidden in long grass is this cube of rock absolutely perfectly
A	yeah
B	nothing
A	wow
B	erm don't know what rock it is
A	yeah
B	but it's not local
A	yeah
B	it's this cube about I don't know sixty centimetres sixty centimetres
A	right yeah
B	and I'm looking at it and I think this is strange and then in the ground I see the top bar of the
A	wow
B	and you can see the side walls going in towards it
A	right
B	but it's filled in right up to the top
A	right okay yeah
B	I don't know whether it's been dug up or not
A	yeah or what
B	probably has
A	yeah
B	in the past but
A	yeah
B	erm the thing is where there's one there's loads
A	right right okay yeah so you're probably standing on a whole sort of cemetery
B	yeah
A	of them yeah yeah
B	a fascinating trip
A	wow
B	but as I say the locals have got no idea
A	no
B	they go out for the walk
A	yeah
B	they go out for the barbeque
A	yeah
B	they'll leave all their rubbish behind
A	yeah
B	erm
A	but they're not interested in exploring
B	no
A	it or trying to
B	I mean I've heard
A	understand it
B	I've heard the argument from my neighbours that er yeah well you have to leave your rubbish behind
B	why?
A	why?
B	cos it gives the council workers something to do
B	they've got nothing to do otherwise
B	I mean he's perfectly serious
A	well
B	I mean er what?
A	yeah that is just wrong
B	yeah crazy
A	it's just
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	I mean some of the some of the mentality here is totally off the wall
A	yeah yeah
B	and they think it's perfectly normal
B	well I suppose they think they're keeping the economy going cos this council worker that picks up the rubbish has got a supervisor
A	yeah
B	who's got a boss
A	yeah
B	whose cousin's one of their family
B	and he's being paid to do it
A	yeah
B	but
A	yeah
B	to think that they could possibly just remotely be able to do something constructive
A	exactly
B	instead of picking up
A	yeah yeah in fact I'm even erm surprised to hear that they even go and send people to pick stuff up because when I've been out and about it looks like litter's been you know there for for ages
B	well I think one of the biggest or the the biggest sinner on the rubbish disposal front is the army the Turkish army
A	mm mm mm
B	we go out with the dogs up into the hills up the back here
A	mm mm
B	erm and it's full of rubbish
A	mm
B	and you look at it and it's ninth battalion
A	okay
B	armoured mechanised division
A	right
B	er have fourth foot and mouth division and
B	whatever they are called
B	so it's some
A	yeah
B	but it's all up all up there in Turkish I mean I wouldn't have known if if I hadn't have been with
A	yeah
B	and
A	oh really?
B	yeah
A	a general's hat?
B	brand well almost brand new not a mark on it
A	oh how funny
B	it must have
A	it must have just
B	thrown
A	blown off or something
B	a general's hat but not in the middle of the wilderness where you can't drive anywhere I mean they've gone up there with trucks and just
A	oh okay
B	and this general's hat was amongst it
A	how strange that's a bit weird isn't it?
B	it's in very good nick shall I get
A	yeah
B	shall shall I?
A	yeah yeah that is
B	we'll have to we'll have to look it up on the internet to see what kind of
A	so
B	rank
A	oh right I see and then
B	erm
A	you've figured it out right
A	that is so weird
B	here
A	oh but god you actually took it with you?
B	yeah
A	you're right it doesn't even have a smell to it does it?
B	well
A	cos normally if they've worn it a bit it has that smell
B	well it normally has a a sweat mark on it and
A	a sweat mark and a personal smell to it
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	mm?
A	that's a bit weird isn't it?
B	yeah we're looking for the rest of him
A	yeah
A	exactly that's what I was thinking they must have done him off somewhere and
B	I mean you could
B	he didn't wear didn't get a chance to wear his hat but we found these
A	yeah
B	bullets with the feet in it
A	a general's hat you've gotta wonder but how's it going with the rewriting?
B	ah well the rewriting is taking its time cos I mean I've
A	okay yeah
B	paid her paid her a year at two hundred and fifty quid a month she's copywriting copyreading and editing
A	who is
B	well she's a Scottish lady who was an English literature teacher
A	right
B	er who was working in a university in
A	right
B	teaching English
A	oh okay
B	and erm we've been going through we've done the first eleven chapters
A	right when did you start? going through the
B	well it was first going we started going through it about a month ago
A	oh okay so it's relatively new then in terms of going through
B	it's relatively new
A	the process
B	but we found
A	yeah
B	a thousand mistakes a chapter
A	oh god
A	bit by bit yeah
B	bit by bit sentence by sentence and I'm thinking hang on this doesn't make sense I think there's a mistake here
A	yeah
B	there's a word missing there
A	yeah
B	it's this
A	so what do you think she just didn't do it?
A	or just didn't
B	oh just didn't
A	really put her heart into it
B	I think she didn't put her heart in it
A	yeah
B	I mean she came and she has some very lively discussions on the subject
A	yeah
B	you know we had some great days er but er
A	mm
B	we're going through it we've put the first eleven chapters we've weeded out we chopped it from a hundred and eighty-six thousand words to a hundred and sixty-five thousand already
A	that's really good going that's amazing that's a huge cull of words
B	yeah
A	yeah yeah
B	erm
A	that's really good
B	we lopped our chapters out that were interesting but irrelevant
A	yeah yeah that's really good yeah that's such a process to go through isn't it? it really
B	yeah
A	it makes it so much stronger as well you know
B	yeah I think so
A	it will do yeah
B	and at the end of the day we're I'm thinking of reissuing it and renaming it
A	yeah yeah
B	like remember remember the ninth of November
A	yeah yeah yeah okay that sounds catchy
B	so the
A	yes yeah that's right it is
B	the ninth of the eleventh
A	yeah
B	and not the eleventh of the ninth
A	yeah yeah it's good ring on the yeah it's a good
B	yeah
A	pun on that phrase
B	erm
A	yeah
B	and we've got rid of I hope some of the racial taint er or like the underlying thing and it's based on real policemen
A	yeah yeah that's
B	I mean
A	the point it's authentic yeah
B	yeah I mean
A	yeah
B	they are
A	racist
B	flawed
A	yeah of course they are yeah
B	erm you know they will go round and call these idiots ragheads
A	yeah of course they will
B	erm
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	I mean that's what people call it's
B	that's what people do you know
A	ragheads or whatever and
B	and
A	yeah
B	did the did
A	the
B	did did one hump short of a camel crash
B	do you think we're gonna catch the
B	but we're not and we didn't
A	yeah exactly
B	so erm
A	mm yeah you mentioned
B	and this you know this was
A	yeah
B	er TV series material
A	yeah
B	bollocks
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	erm
A	uhu
B	and er they didn't want this politically incorrect mega explosion to happen in the middle of London
A	uhu
B	er they just wanted the police to catch the guy before he did it and have a happy end basically
A	that's rubbish
B	the book was about
A	I don't think anybody would want to watch that it's not exciting enough it's not
B	the book
A	original
B	the book was about somebody
A	yeah
B	came up with the idea
A	yeah
B	that why spend fourteen billion dollars a year on a war
A	yeah
B	when you can cure it with a twenty pence vaccine
A	yeah
B	er virus?
A	yeah yeah yeah yeah
B	and it wasn't until I literally finished the book that I read this thing on er Bush Cheney and Rumsfeld on the defence of America
A	okay
B	in the twentieth twenty-first century
A	right yeah
B	well they said that they were genetically building viruses erm to be erm racially specific
A	uhu uhu
B	so that far from being a tool of terror in the future
A	uhu
B	it would be a politically useful weapon
A	yeah absolutely
B	and I thought fucking hell
A	yeah
B	what?
[ANNOTATION]	viruses can be turned into war weapons	Entailment
A	yeah yeah
A	here's my evidence
B	yeah and just just designing this virus by accident
B	er and it's knocking off pakis by the dozen
B	er and these people are working on doing it and then you think well if they're doing it
A	yeah yeah exactly yeah
B	maybe the Chinese are doing it
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	many viruses are currently being harvested in labs	Neutral
B	or the Russians are doing it
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	if the Iranians are doing it
A	yeah
B	I mean it's the easiest
A	yeah
B	way
A	yeah
B	of killing people
A	oh yeah
B	that I know
[ANNOTATION]	they are speculating about the use of virus	Entailment
A	yeah absolutely
B	you don't need to build high technology rocket science and
A	yeah
B	all that
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a is a lab scientist	Neutral
A	that's the whizz bang whoops stuff you know
B	yeah
A	that's the stuff that you put on television
B	yeah
A	however this other stuff the stuff you don't need to really put on television
B	yeah
A	nobody wants to really know about it
[ANNOTATION]	they watch the news every day on tv	Neutral
B	they're frightened to shit if you
A	yeah
B	and er er and
A	of people just dying in their thousands
B	and some of the things that have come up that I've put in the book which erm
A	yeah yeah
B	and they created two point eight billion doses of the
A	yeah
B	in Europe
A	yeah yeah
B	there were only nine known transmissions
A	mm
B	of peer to peer
A	mm
B	amongst humans
A	mm so
B	yeah
A	yeah and stockpiling
B	erm
A	yeah
B	and certain companies made an absolute fortune and one of the companies that made an absolute fortune the second time round
A	mm
B	and
A	who was that?
B	happened to be Sandoz in
A	oh okay
B	who bought the licence for Tamiflu from
A	oh right
B	I'm just trying to think
A	mm mm
B	and when he took up er political office his erm
A	yeah
B	and the trust sold the shares to Sandoz
A	right
B	and Sandoz immediately got an order from the American government for two million doses of Tamiflu at a hundred dollars apiece
A	bloody hell
B	yeah
A	when you've got people like that doing those kind of tricks yeah
B	yeah
A	mm
B	and erm
A	mm
B	that was held in trust
A	so he seemed to have
B	got to be something weird
A	quite a heavy hand in this yeah yeah
B	a mint
A	yeah
B	well it was that that put me on the course of looking at what I'm doing in the sequel to that book which I've spent well
A	oh that's good yeah
B	which is all about er
A	right
B	Nazi war chest
A	yeah okay yeah
B	that was secreted out of America via Holland
A	yeah
B	to to banks in New York the
A	yeah
B	Union Bank of New York
A	okay
B	and erm Brown Brothers Harriman
A	oh
B	BBH
A	okay
B	and the interesting thing about that is that the Union Bank of New York was run by Joseph Bush George Bush's father and the other one was run by George Walker George Bush
A	oh yeah
B	father in law
A	of course yeah god it's all stitched up isn't it?
B	and all those assets were frozen by the US government
A	uhu uhu
B	er so the two banks were er virtually illiquid
A	yeah yeah
B	and four days later they got three and a half million dollars in cash injected into these two banks
A	bloody hell
B	er just after the death of General Sikorski
A	oh yeah okay yeah
B	and General Sikorski
A	yeah
B	had just engineered the removal of seven tonnes of gold bullion from the Polish National Bank under the eyes of the Nazis
A	yeah
B	a tonne of gold bullion in those days
A	yeah
B	was exactly a million dollars
A	yeah okay right yeah
B	seven million dollars divided by two
A	yeah
B	three and a half million
A	yeah
B	Sikorski dies the gold disappears
A	yeah
B	it was never found
A	right
B	there's no connection
A	yeah that is yeah that's a good one yeah
B	there's no connection
A	yeah
B	that I can find
A	yeah
B	but it's
A	but it's
B	very coincidental isn't it?
A	very coincidental yeah yeah they never did find that did they?
B	and the more I go
A	mm mm
B	er all connected with this same bunch of people
A	how do you if it's research the coincidences how do you go about looking for those connections?
B	er difficult to say really it's it's partly intuitive
A	is it patterns that come out at you that you kind of jump out and you
B	there's patterns that you see and you think well hang on just a minute I've seen this somewhere else you know I've read the history books and
A	yeah
B	you know there's all sorts of things that I mean
A	right okay
B	er
B	lovely guy
A	yeah
B	er we used to spend most of the times talking about cricket and drinking coffee
A	yeah
B	er he did a great er job in the garden
A	yeah
B	he laid all my terraces for me
A	yeah nice one
B	erm er he looked after the place when I wasn't here when I was still travelling backwards and forwards to Germany
A	mm
B	but we sat down and he was saying you know he got out of Pakistan because the secret police and
A	mm
B	they are terrible
A	mm mm mm
B	er his family had been harassed and whatever
A	right yeah
B	and how he died
A	okay how did he die?
B	erm Zia-ul-Haq was er one of these
A	right
B	erm so the Americans were very suspicious of him but because he was waging war against India er Kashmir at the time
A	mm
B	the Americans were quite keen
A	quite handy yeah
B	to supply him with
A	yes
B	hardware
A	yeah
B	and at the time they had a lot of surplus hardware
A	right okay
B	er in Europe
A	uhu
B	er because of
A	mm
B	the fall of the cold war
A	uhu
B	the end of the cold war
A	mm
B	and
A	yeah
B	you know they could see it coming and plus the fact they just had two oil crises where their M48 tanks which were petrol driven
A	uhu uhu
B	erm
A	couldn't go anywhere yeah
B	well you know they'd take them
A	yeah
B	twenty miles and they'd have to refuel
A	yeah exactly
B	them you know
A	it's just
B	they
A	too expensive to run
B	couldn't get the logistics
A	yeah
B	so they thought oh we'll palm these tanks off on the Pakistanis
A	uhu makes sense
B	so er at the idea was to float the Pakistani's eight hundred M48 battle tanks plus all the ancillary equipment and
A	mm uhu
A	tonnes of equipment
B	it was
A	yeah
B	big deals of a couple of billion dollars
A	mm mm
B	and to convince erm
A	worth it
B	the right thing
A	yes
B	they er organised a demonstration of the tank's capabilities in a place called Bahawalpur
A	okay
B	and erm ul-Haq flew down from Islamabad to Bahawalpur in a C-130 Hercules
A	right okay
B	er to look at this demonstration and erm
A	oh
B	the tank builders and
A	okay
B	whatever
A	yeah yeah
B	were in the plane going back to Islamabad
A	oh okay
B	to sort of talk about the deal
A	yeah yeah
B	and the plane crashed on take off and killed everybody on board
A	god yeah I do remember something about that yeah
B	and on the same day that it crashed
A	yeah
B	in America
A	yeah
B	on exactly the same day
A	yeah that
B	a strange coincidence
A	very bizarre that
B	and er the successor to ul-Huq was a guy called
A	uhu
B	er Benazir Bhutto's husband
A	mm uhu
B	known as Mr Ten Percent
A	mm uhu heard of that yeah
B	erm
A	yeah
B	and he signed the deal
A	right
B	and the eight hundred absolutely useful fucking tanks went to
A	it
B	Pakistan
A	yeah yeah
B	and Kashmir war happened
A	yeah
B	and Pakistani tanks got wiped out and the Americans sent the
A	yeah great
B	fine
A	yeah
B	they actually bought these back as scrap
A	oh did they?
B	yes
A	bastards
B	yeah
A	yeah the duplicity
B	is just un fucking
A	yeah it is
B	believable
A	it's such a massive game isn't it?
B	yeah
A	it's such a massive game
B	and then you say well you know where's the democracy in this? where is the political steering?
A	there isn't any
B	there isn't
A	no
B	it's just the banks and business and rich families doing it
A	yeah it's well it's because they can play games
B	yeah
A	and they wanna win
B	yeah
A	yeah yeah
B	and er
A	it's a way of structuring their time and their wealth and their interests
B	yeah and it's just making money
A	yeah
B	making money making money
A	yeah
B	and
A	yeah
B	discovering this trail of coincidences
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Person A is talking about the making money and some coincidences	Neutral
B	and how it leads into
A	yeah
B	present day Isis you know is Isis a fictional organisation
A	yeah
B	created by the CIA?
A	you see if you lived in America and Hollywood as a well known scriptwriter all of this stuff you'd be jobbed for life
B	yeah
A	you know you all of this stuff that you research you know
B	they don't
A	would be constantly
B	they don't wanna know
A	be put into the
B	they don't want to know
A	not in not around here they don't you know as in the UK aren't quite good enough picking up er erm these sorts of ideas
B	well I don't know I mean I've picked up a thing on the on the internet which I've posted and er I thought I'd get loads of flack from it
[ANNOTATION]	Person B have thought that he could have flack from what he put on the internet	Entailment
A	mm
B	about two British supply planes shot down supplying Isis with weapons and food
A	right okay yeah yeah
B	and I've got an open question to the Ministry of Defence on this
B	saying have you lost two planes recently?
B	are we gonna see
B	or has or have they already been returned to their friends in the UK?
[ANNOTATION]	Person B had two question from Ministry of Defense about loosing two planes	Entailment
B	nothing
A	no
B	not a single
B	comment
A	wow
B	zero
A	yeah well no I mean I can understand the MOD never they're the well they're never going to play it on that level you know
B	no
A	but what I'm
B	but I'm surprised the British press haven't picked up on it
A	well I'm not if you see who thinks about who runs the British press
[ANNOTATION]	Person A is not amazed that the British press did not cover the news	Neutral
B	well exactly
A	I mean it's it's
B	I mean this is media manipulation
[ANNOTATION]	Person B think it is media attaint	Neutral
A	yeah yeah
B	and it's one of the other things that I picked up in my research you know they're going through the Rockefeller memoirs Averell Harriman's memoirs erm
A	mm mm mm
B	really scary
A	mm
B	things the Dutch royal family is involved
A	mm
B	erm and then you get er the secret societies the Bilderberg group and I mean I don't place a lot of
[ANNOTATION]	Person B is going to dance	Contradiction
A	mm
B	credit in that crap but er
A	right
B	erm he disappeared overnight he was
A	yeah he did didn't he?
B	world famous he was
A	yeah
B	the guy he was
A	yeah
B	the
A	yeah he was
B	American hero
A	he was like the face of everything
B	yeah
A	for America for a while yeah
B	and erm from one day to the next
A	yeah
B	he disappeared
A	yeah that's true
B	disgraced almost
A	yeah
B	you know and almost like he was stripped of his rank and
A	yeah
B	thrown out
A	he was ostracised
B	and I found out that erm a container with eight hundred million dollars
A	mm
B	disappeared in Baghdad
A	uhu
B	and also another container containing eleven tonnes of pure heroin from Afghanistan also disappeared
A	right okay
B	under Colin Powell's
A	watch yeah
B	watch or yeah his
A	yeah his
B	his his management
A	yeah
B	and I am sure that that was one of the reasons or those were the two reasons why he was dismissed
A	right okay
B	it's very strange that this very powerful elite Bilderberg group appointed Colin Powell
A	yeah yeah in the
B	four days after
A	first place
B	he was dismissed
A	yeah yeah yeah that's true that's very true I remember thinking that's really really weird
B	eight hundred million
A	yeah
B	dollars I don't know how much
A	yeah
B	eleven tonnes of pure heroin is but
A	yeah well
B	it's gotta be a lot of money
B	erm
A	yes he just
B	just in the club now
A	did didn't he? yeah that's it that was
B	he's got enough
A	that was it
B	that was his
A	yeah
B	entry ticket
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	yeah
A	and you'll live the best lifestyle you can imagine yeah yeah
B	can't prove a thing can't find anything more about him
A	no
B	he's disappeared he's off the face of the planet
A	but you know what I mean though like in terms of the films that I've seen I mean I watch a lot of films and what you do is that you find the you're you're digging for the truth you know you're searching for the truth
B	yeah
A	buying that I mean even seeing James Bond movies the latest ones
B	yeah
A	you can see how they're connecting
B	yeah
A	reality or multiple realities into a storyline that kind of would be viable and I would say viable and I would say very entertaining so lots of your ideas and lots of how you look for things
B	yeah but I'm doing I'm doing this as a fiction
A	yeah exactly it is fiction
B	mm
A	that's right and and that's how you're transplanting your truth your search
B	mm
A	for truth into the
B	yeah
A	erm so that's why I can understand who these people who you talk to who said that they wanted to change you know
B	mm
A	the whole
B	but
A	whole idea the premise of it
B	they actually travelled on a Saturday morning
A	yeah
B	to make Gatwick Airport a half past seven to talk to me about the changes
A	yeah the I
B	and I sent them the changes
A	say that just it's like they don't get it
B	and never heard another dickybird
A	maybe they just thought it was too hot to handle
B	I don't know
A	that they personally couldn't
B	yeah well
A	see a way to
B	well they could have easily could have turned around and said well you know
A	yeah
B	but nothing
A	yeah
B	zilch
A	yeah yeah no that is very weird well I think you just sort of put that aside
B	yeah
A	and just forget about it
B	move away from it
A	but erm in terms of well certainly you're rewriting at the moment and it's gonna be a lot shorter from what you're telling me
B	no it's gonna be about a hundred and fifty pages shorter
A	okay
B	it's gonna be about four hundred and fifty pages
A	yeah yeah
B	er but it's a lot punchier it's a lot faster
A	yeah
B	erm
A	yeah
B	there's like twenty-five thousand dead
A	yeah
B	in the London blast alone
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	erm and then forty-five thousand dead a month in England from the flu virus
A	mm mm that's a lot of CGI if you're thinking of translating that into you know but that's all doable these days I mean
B	yeah
A	but yeah so the I guess once you've finished that when you've finished the book or when I don't know how you're thinking of doing it but what I would advise you to advise anyway if you wanted to
B	okay
A	yeah okay
B	what's that?
A	so the three major documents in film
B	mm
A	is you have a synopsis which is the shortest
B	mm
A	so that's for the busy you know Hollywood exec who just goes I can't be bothered to read it
B	mm
A	it's like two paragraphs then you
B	it's your your elevator pitch
A	yes exactly
B	the ten seconds you've got to
A	while you have your pitch line
B	get them interested
A	and then you have
B	mm
A	your synopsis and then
B	mm
A	your treatment might be three or four pages which is the basic outline of the story and then after that you'll have your script so that will be your drafted script and that's the that's the documentation that you need with producers
B	that's like the book
A	yes it's like the book but obviously
B	mm
A	mostly dialogue
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	well I mean
A	yeah
B	the book is mostly dialogue anyway
A	yeah yeah that's that's what I thought
B	mm
A	which was really good so erm so the treatment is the thing that I suppose
B	mm
A	because you're not yet committed to reading the script cos you can imagine how many scripts they get
B	yeah
A	you're not committed to reading it but you're interested enough to know how the story will come out you know you will read it to the end and find out what what the ending is so
B	but do you think Hollywood are gonna be interested in duplicitous American conspiracies?
A	mm
B	well I mean the the the quiet way has got it's not the American duplicity
A	no it's not yeah
B	no this one
A	yeah yeah
B	is gonna be
A	yeah but even or even if
B	mm
A	you're looking at a British producer
B	mm
A	and an American producer directors would be interested in it because for them it could be quite political
B	mm
A	you know so directors have like a totally different er cap on their head but producers are the ones who are going to go out there and search for the director and for the money
B	mm
A	so unless you get to a very famous director first who can then go to the producer but the chances are you'll be dealing with producers first
B	I mean we we've had a sort of
A	right okay yeah she's very smart yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah she's very smart yeah yeah she's
B	attractive smart could be
A	she's attractive yeah
B	erm
A	yeah
B	she would fit that
A	yeah
B	down to the
A	yeah she'd
B	made
A	yeah yeah well this is also that's what helps is that you can you know you can put that down as your kind of you know your wish list of people
B	and erm what's his name? Wambaugh
A	who sorry?
B	Steve Wambaugh? he was a in the oh I've bloody
A	one of the Batman films?
B	W A M B A U G H
A	okay yeah I can't picture his face right now
B	as well he was
A	yeah
B	taking him as the as as the detective
A	yeah yeah
B	erm he's a bit young erm
A	well that certainly helps
B	yeah
A	I think that certainly helps
B	well I mean who do we pitch to? that's my problem and I've got no
A	you have to pitch to producers
B	no contacts at all
A	yeah
B	I mean I don't know any
A	well okay let me explain to you what I understand and you see how it fits in if there's a square
B	do you want another coffee?
A	yeah that would be great thanks so what generally happens is is that you get to
B	mm
A	or some are hunting they are already looking so you are obviously trying to find the ones who are hunting
B	yeah
A	and then what you do is you basically get a whole erm bunch of
B	mm
A	unless you're in the Hollywood system
B	mm
A	for filmmakers there's all whole host of reasons why certain producers will put their hands up and say I'm Swedish you're British you're German
B	mm
A	so
B	mm
A	I mean in Europe he'll never get that amount of money from one country the UK just doesn't have enough money
B	well the beauty of this is
A	put aside
B	that it can be such a simple film to make
A	right
B	because it's all office bound there's no big action scenes
A	yeah
B	where you've gotta
A	yeah
B	spend many a bucks on blowing cities off the
A	yeah
B	map
A	yeah
B	I mean the explosion in London can literally be glasses rattling on a table in a bunker
A	yeah yeah
B	two hundred metres underground
A	that's true and that could be very suspense you know there's a lot of suspense in that
B	and they can watch it
A	yeah yeah
B	on television
A	yeah it's
B	the aftermath
A	yeah
B	is just this big fireball
A	yeah yeah
B	erm
A	yeah so it's
B	yeah
A	it's a thriller in that sense
B	yeah and if
A	yeah yeah
B	you then sort of wanna turn around and say okay we're gonna pan the camera over the ruins okay you get some fucking footage of a Russia or a
A	yeah
B	er whatever and
A	yeah
B	tart it up with
A	yeah
B	Photoshop or whatever you're gonna do
A	well you see that's the bit the treatment is really helpful because what you've just told me I didn't know
B	mm
A	about this film cos I might see it differently
B	mm
A	cos I would might have thought oh crikey it's gonna be lots of money yeah it's gonna be this and that and the other but your treatment could explain that it could say this is not a high budget film this can be done
B	it doesn't need to be
A	it
B	it can be
A	yeah
B	you know you can go the whole
A	but if it's a thriller
B	mm
A	you you know what you can see is like most producers would go what genre is this? thrillers they know that sometimes it can be high budget
B	mm
A	but I mean they also know it can be quite low budget
B	mm
A	thrillers I mean I love you know or I'm the kind of person who can is easily sit and watch erm you know Blunt and what's and all of that spy stuff
B	yeah
A	and you know I
B	well my favourite film of all time is the original BBC version or did I say film? series Smiley's People
A	The Cambridge Spies oh which one?
B	Smiley's People
A	Smiley's People
B	with Alec Guinness
A	yeah okay alright cos I'm just yeah
B	wow it gives me goosebumps
A	yeah yeah
B	it was just so clever I mean
A	yeah
B	the book was hairy and that just
A	yeah
B	encapsulated it
A	I'll have to see that again actually I haven't seen it for a while
B	Alec Guinness was just so good
A	I'll have to see that erm but er Smiley's People and so we know that thrillers can be done in in that kind of more keyed down kind of
B	I mean action the action's in the dialogue the action's in the interaction between the players
A	yeah
B	erm okay you need to take a location shot
A	thank you so this is actually what you would write
A	this film is set in
A	yeah
B	set in
A	in yeah
B	London
A	uhu
B	Chester
A	yep
B	Afghanistan
A	thank you yeah yeah
B	and the Afghanistani bit or the Pakistani bit
A	can be done anywhere yeah
B	can be done anywhere
A	can be done here
B	you can do it on the bloody fields up here
A	yeah exactly
B	and they'll just get some
A	yeah and that's what they often do
B	yeah
A	yeah they'll just find
B	erm
A	somewhere that yeah mocks up for it
B	and er you know really you don't have to go very far
A	yeah
B	I mean you did all your spaghetti westerns erm
A	yeah yeah oh no that's not
B	yeah
A	a problem
B	erm
A	yeah
B	filming erm I dunno things like Chester Town Hall and Chester police station and the old scenic things in Chester
A	yeah
B	god they could just go on the bloody internet and download the crap
A	yeah but these days
B	don't even have to go there
A	people places like Chester are crying out for films to be made
B	yeah
A	in their in their town or cities
B	yeah
A	because it's good business for them
B	yeah
A	you know people go on these kind of mad trips
B	and
A	going er
B	going to where
B	the film
A	yeah
B	was made
A	exactly like
B	and everything
A	Withnail and I oh we'll go to
B	erm
A	every pub in London or whatever yeah
B	and erm er Hemel Hempstead
A	yeah
B	you know it's world famous for the two thousand and five explosion
A	uhu uhu
B	erm I went there two weeks afterwards I just couldn't believe it
A	so there'll be footage of that as well
B	oh there's loads
A	yeah be loads of footage
B	there's loads of documentaries
A	yeah yeah
B	about it
A	yeah yeah
B	but I mean
A	yeah
B	Buncefield doesn't blow up in this one
A	yeah yeah
B	er the litres or thirty tonnes of ether blows up in the middle of London
A	yes
B	Bank Underground station and
B	outside the Bank of England and Mansion House
A	yeah but somebody would that be portrayed in the treatment that you'd actually see those explosions or you'd see the aftermath?
B	do you need it?
A	yeah
B	one of the greatest films I ever saw and I can't remember the name of it was a Japanese film black and white
A	oh I know the one you mean
B	where
A	yeah
B	they cut the girl's
A	yes
B	those tendons at the back of her
A	yeah
B	legs
A	yeah though
B	and you didn't see it
A	yeah
B	they didn't
A	no you
B	you heard her screaming
A	yeah
B	and all you heard was this knife going
A	yeah just
B	and the screams
A	and you knew you knew
B	and you knew what had happened
A	yeah
B	and this girl comes out
A	yeah
B	bleeding
A	yeah oh god
B	and she
A	it's just
B	the back of her legs like that
A	oh that's just so horrible
B	and you go
A	oh no I know it's just so horrible
B	you can still get her knees apart to shag but she can't bloody run away
B	ah
A	oh god no I know
B	wicked
A	just so horrible
B	evil
A	that's so horrible but a lot of audiences are getting more erm I would
B	yeah
A	a lot of the time you've sort of got to think about what are the age group? me I'd love that kind of filler you're suggesting a younger crowd might be interested in the story but they might say to themselves actually I want the big stuff I wanna see what London looks like when it's being pretty much obliterated you know but that's the thing about the treatment
B	mm
A	you're giving somebody an idea of how it can be done we all know that this will probably be changed the process of filmmaking just passes hands from
B	is done anyway
A	from one yeah
B	yeah
A	it's it it it is
B	but I mean it's
A	it comes when it comes
B	the the issue of showing the damage
A	mm uhu
B	the issue of showing the damage I don't think's a big thing because there is enough colour footage of the devastation in Germany in the Second World War
A	uhu
B	that could be trimmed
A	mm
B	to show flattened buildings
A	mm
B	and
A	uhu
B	whatever
A	uhu
B	er and all you have to do is photoshop a couple of bloody
A	yeah
B	London
A	yeah
B	lamp posts or
A	well I mean
B	street signs into it
A	what they can do now
B	it's unbelievable
A	I mean it it looks like it would be London
B	yeah erm
A	yeah yeah
B	you know I don't erm I don't have any erm issue with that er you can show I mean I picked up one on the internet there's a tank of butane gas
A	uhu
B	that blows up
A	okay
B	it blew the camera off its tripod a mile away
A	right that's pretty cool
B	erm
A	yeah that must look really amazing
B	that is
A	yeah
A	the the
B	yeah
A	the actual petrol tank it was weighed six tonnes was blown
A	shit
B	three quarters of a mile through the air
A	bloody hell
B	it was in the middle of the desert thank christ
A	yeah yeah yeah yeah
B	but imagine that in a city?
A	yeah and that happening
B	and you imagine half of that down a Tube station?
A	oh my god no yeah that
B	I mean
A	that that looks that you see
B	mm
A	those kind of visuals do sound quite appealing at the same time
B	London London Underground?
A	yeah
B	yeah I mean flames going up tunnels
A	yeah
B	they've done it with James Bond a hundred times
A	yeah
B	you know
A	but it still adds to it
B	yeah
A	you know the visual side of it is like you do if you imagine watching it in the cinema
B	mm
A	big screen with the whole sound you know going on you know that would get your heart going
B	yeah
A	and that would definitely make you feel quite pacey you know so the
B	I mean right at the last minute
A	it's exciting
B	just before this thing goes up this copper comes up to the tanker driver and puts his hand on his shoulder and says ello ello ello what's going on here then?
A	and then they see the flames coming out of the Underground station
A	yeah right yeah
B	boom
A	yeah
B	it's gone and you think
A	yeah
B	you've saved the day
A	yeah
A	yeah and he bloody hasn't
A	no chance yeah exactly
A	yeah I think
A	well the financial centre of London
B	yeah
A	is gonna go down
B	yeah
A	the Bank of England is gonna be blown off the map
B	yeah
A	Mansion House is gonna be blown off the map
B	yeah
A	it's gonna be about a square kilometre of buildings that's demolished
A	yeah
B	but a blast like that
A	yeah yeah and this is very er this is er it's symbolic as well you know I think it is er it it helps an audience to understand that this could be one's reality if you were unlucky enough to be in London at that particular time shit happens
B	mm
A	and if you somehow manage to survive
B	and the other half of the tanker goes bang and blows you off
B	the face of the planet
A	yeah that's right and you go sailing off that way yeah exactly
B	no
A	look around and be a survivor yeah yeah
B	mm
A	advantage and I think that
A	never be scared of money I always er was taught that
B	mm
B	mm
A	it's the right visual for a director and now what we can do with CGI is just incredible most people want to achieve excellence
B	mm
A	in their visuals erm so never be scared of that money you know it's not about getting a low budget film it's about
B	no I mean
A	the right budget for the film
B	would you would you recommend erm
A	mm
B	for the pitch?
A	like a storyboard or something?
B	mm
A	yeah yeah but
B	mm
A	is the actual king yeah I think the
B	mm
A	treatment still is the standard document I think some people would like the visuals but most producers have worked with directors and they
B	got a picture in their head anyway
A	they've already got it if it's well written they're kind of like
B	mm
A	going okay this person knows how to write a treatment it's jumping off the page like most
B	mm
A	I guess visuals can and er they'll either go yes I can see it or no I can't or go back and ask the person
B	can you give me an example of a treatment can you send me one or?
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	yeah?
A	I've got I've got the whole package of
B	mm
A	what the
B	yeah
A	elevator pitch line the synopsis
B	mm
A	the treatment and then there are like you know er off the peg software applications that you can buy that will format your whole entire script for you
B	mm
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about software applications	Entailment
A	puts it inside
B	mm
A	format and then you
B	like like like a like a play
A	like a play yeah
B	yeah
A	exactly and it'll do everything for you
B	he says she says
A	that's
B	she said he said
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about a play	Entailment
A	that's right and all you have to do is then go over it and make it into what you think is the visuals you know
B	mm
A	because dialogue is still visual cos there's all the idea about your facial gestures everything is still in in that you know
B	yeah I mean it's it's I mean it's basically how I wrote the book
A	uhu
B	you've got a column here describing what's going on
A	uhu uhu
B	and then you've got a column here erm
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about column position	Neutral
A	yeah yeah
B	er
A	yes
B	these kind of things but they're the expressions that you've tagged on to the sentence to give the impression because it doesn't always come over in the dialogue
A	yes that's and that's the key to erm a professional scriptwriter I
B	mm
A	meaning as someone who's got
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about scriptwriter	Entailment
B	mm
A	gone through those experiences is that adverbs come up less and less and what you're seeing is somebody who's describing the facial gestures so there will be you know when someone's tired you would rather put in that kind of squint of the eye
B	yeah
A	the flick of the lid the tension in the jaw you know what you're describing is what you see when people are tired
B	mm
A	but you're not using adverbs like
B	mm
A	tired and or yeah so but anyway that's a just a small thing the the point is is that you could buy this software application
B	mm
A	how you want it get it in there erm and then what you do is you start well I would advise that you write the treatment first because you write the script to your treatment
B	mm
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about party	Contradiction
A	rather than the other way round
B	yeah sure
A	yeah? erm mainly because the treatment is the is the
B	mm
A	like this for most of the page about less than a third of that page of an A4 page is description
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about book	Contradiction
B	mm
A	and it's something like internal external day night
B	yeah
A	it's quite basic
B	mm
A	if they wanna cut to that clock back to you they'll do it and
B	yeah
A	that's their
B	that's their bit
A	that's their bit
B	mm
A	but what you're trying to to I think is place the emphasis on the characters because the director until he's read that script a number of times doesn't know the characters as well as the scriptwriter because the scriptwriter knows the back story
B	mm
A	knows is has internalised the character
B	yeah
A	stories
B	I think that's the difficulty in in getting the back story into the character because you don't have a lot of time especially in films to put the back story in there
A	which is why the character arc and I think that
B	mm
A	might be what those people were talking about is so very useful for you if you can stick to that to begin with erm you can break some rules later
B	mm
A	but the point is is that if somebody wants to know erm is this guy for real has he got a professional script for me to read he'll he or she the producer will look okay can they do their sums? does two and two equal four? give me the character arc without that character arc they might not believe that you've actually got the rest of it right
B	mm
A	so it's kind of like a tick to see if you can get into the next kind of you know
B	into the next box
A	the level the next box
B	yeah
A	yeah so character arcs are very useful and then you can break the
B	mm
A	them so like most plays you have in film anyway you have three major scenes er acts sorry
B	yeah
A	erm sorry I'm getting a bit tired so you have three major acts and the character arc
B	sure
A	just to yeah
B	sure sure sure
A	I'm sure this won't be anything new to you but erm
B	well it
A	just for the
B	it probably will cos erm
A	just for visuals sake it's it's
A	useful to look at something isn't it? erm so you'll have your three your three acts let's just see we'll mark them down like that because the second act tends to be a bit longer erm mainly because you can use montage at the beginning you can use lots of montage to cut to your story to start very quickly and then you know an ending can appear like in a flash like what? it just ended? that's it so this bit is the bit that normally takes for ages is the second act and this is where people tend to
B	well I tried that with my initial character
A	yeah
B	to do two amazing things that happen to him
A	yes okay so plot those for me what what what are those two things?
B	the two things are one
A	you can plot them somewhere
B	he is starting off erm
A	uhu
B	and calling his guys in on a Sunday and saying listen I've just had this breakthrough idea
A	uhu
B	and we're gonna do this that and the other
A	uhu
B	and they're all going oh fuck off cos you know it's a Sunday and
A	yeah
A	we're we're not gonna bother yeah
B	and er one of them said no this is what we what we need is some clever bastard who does something like the laundry thing in Northern Ireland
A	right okay yeah
B	and this the hero's sidekick turns round and says er shut your face
A	right
B	and looking at him
A	right okay yeah
B	and he said the laundry thing where they went round with a laundry boat collecting the washing from the houses and testing it for gunpowder and
A	oh okay
B	and explosives
A	that's the laundry thing right yeah yeah
B	and then went back and arrested a terrorist and the terrorists all thought they were being informed by their own people
A	yeah okay
B	that's it I didn't know he said well it's not exactly something that they publish in the newspapers
A	yeah
B	is it?
A	yeah
B	can we get on?
A	yeah okay
B	that's the first thing
A	okay
B	the second thing is that he's lost his wife in a car bomb
A	okay
B	and he doesn't know who did it it could have been a police job
A	which happened first? the laundry thing is an inciting thing and the erm inciting
B	and the
A	incident
B	yeah
A	and the car bomb
B	the car bomb is the same night you learned about the car bomb but it was in the past
A	yeah
B	and because he gets reminded about his wife
A	yeah
B	he goes on a drinking binge
A	okay so the drinking binge is really where it starts?
B	yeah
A	because you see him unravel or you
B	well you see
A	you see
B	no you see it first of all in his very very
A	yeah
B	and then he goes out and he thinks well because I've done this er what he's doing he's examining PAYE records
A	yes
B	er in the town
A	yeah
B	where they've got a very very low immigrant population
A	yeah
B	and saying well we're gonna look at anything that looks slightly tinted
A	right
B	that's got a new
A	okay
B	and then we're gonna take these seventy or eighty people and we're gonna knock on some doors tomorrow
A	okay right
B	because our our boy that we're looking for is one of these I'm sure of it
A	okay okay
B	so that's his laundry scam is the PAYE thing
A	okay
B	but he said on top of that he said I'm going to go out he said while you lot get your heads round who's gonna knock on which door and which teams you're gonna do it he says I'm gonna go and talk to a couple of guys who let out cheap accommodation to tinted folk
A	right
B	or aliens he calls them
A	right yeah
B	erm
A	yeah
B	erm and they just happen to frequent my local boozer or one of my local boozers
A	right and then the drinking binge?
B	and then the drinking binge and he gets given from the landlord who's a great mate of his he gets given a erm a CD of a bootleg Led Zeppelin concert
A	right
B	that he goes back and listens to and he has a brandy too many
A	yeah
B	and the next
A	okay
B	and in that night this virus institute gets broken into
A	okay
B	so he's totally hungover the next morning and he's up on the phone and Samantha says boss you'd better get in here
A	yeah
B	chief superintendent's just given you two fingers
A	yeah okay
B	which what the fuck I don't like that guy anyway
A	yeah
B	erm
A	okay
B	so that's the kick off
A	alright so so what you would do then is you would decide
B	but it's not only trying to present this guy as a clever bollocks
A	no
B	but also as a
A	he's got problems
B	flawed human
A	oh yeah he's got issues as well yeah that's right so you've got the cause and effect it seems like you accelerate erm from let's say quite a normal situation
B	mm
A	at the beginning I think the hunch is where it starts to
B	mm
A	kick in and this is actually what propels him to start
B	yeah
A	and then you would mark out for example you know it's quite easy to do if you think about film being as being let's say a hundred and twenty minutes these days because a page of A4 script that's formatted
B	mm
A	is about a minute
B	mm
A	it's a rule of thumb
A	yeah
B	I found it totally boring
A	yeah well treatments are quite boring
B	I mean it lasts for no I mean the film itself I find
A	yeah
B	the action
A	the film's
B	brain deadening
A	yeah
B	it was just fighting
A	yes
B	where was the plot?
A	yeah
B	and it think hang on this is a film for morons
A	yeah yeah
B	the book wasn't
A	yes
A	no I completely agree with you I completely agree with you but what can happen is that erm what you wanna do so you normally have what is in it? so you've got time here and you've got act there okay? or if you wanted to do you can do time here which I'll guess is a bit normal and then here you can have the escalation of and you have to choose if you want to use the character arc about this man
B	justice justice justice justice
A	so the search for truth yeah
B	yeah search
A	yeah
B	for truth
A	okay and then you can do
B	and and getting justice I mean he's pissed off with
A	yeah
B	you know giving sort of car bombers er asbos and erm electronic ankle bracelets
A	yeah
B	so you know that's not
A	yeah
B	his scene and he'd rather
A	yeah
B	put them up in a market square and give them a thousand lashes
A	yeah
B	erm he's one of the old school
A	he's hard talking
A	yeah exactly yeah
B	erm
A	uhu
B	erm reviews he's always got out of them
A	uhu is that because
B	erm
A	he's an alcoholic?
B	no erm he was er seconded to erm
A	okay
B	and he stepped a couple of times the wrong side of the law and these are
A	okay
B	true anecdotes from a mate of mine
A	yeah yeah
B	who's a retired
A	I can imagine that to be true
B	a retired
A	yeah yeah
B	erm
A	yeah
B	army major in
A	yeah
B	bomb disposal there
A	yeah well my dad was a lieutenant colonel and served twice in Northern Ireland
B	yeah
A	so that's one thing
B	erm
A	I can understand yeah
B	you know sort of like filling filling basements with butane gas
A	yeah
B	and waiting for the mix to go down
A	yeah
B	and bare bums and light the first
A	yeah right
B	cigarette and
A	yeah
B	boom oh that's
A	yeah
B	six of them go up in an own goal
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	alright
A	well so
B	I mean
A	shit happens
B	involved in things like that
A	yeah exactly
B	erm cos he knows that he can't get them cos they're the wrong side of the border
A	yeah
B	they're not gonna extradite them and if they do extradite them
A	exactly
B	what are they gonna do?
A	yeah
B	they're gonna cost the taxpayer money and
A	yeah
B	whatever
A	yeah
B	and he's been hauled up in front of his seniors for being or his superiors for being over zealous
A	yeah
B	but he's much loved on the frontline
A	yeah
B	erm
A	so he's out to prove a point?
B	yeah
A	that actually he is
B	yeah
A	to his superiors
B	yeah and he's
A	yeah
A	to get his
B	this anti authoritarian thing and he's also
A	right
B	got a flea in his head because the er the car bombing of his wife erm didn't turn up with any clues
A	mm
B	erm because er some of his serious crimes er investigations
A	uhu
B	might have erm tangentially touched some of his superiors er he's
A	ah okay
B	got the suspicion that maybe
A	yeah
B	some of them are involved
A	yes
B	and they were trying to blow him up but she
A	yeah
A	right
B	and the car blew up
A	right okay
B	and it was aimed at him
A	okay so there
B	yes it's dinner time I know
A	so all of these things what you've just mentioned
B	mm
A	there I can already see that there's you know there's quite a lot of erm strands to his let's say to his
B	yeah
A	but to make it easy for a producer to understand you have to choose one
B	mm
A	and they will explore all of the things that you're talking about of course cos that's the stuff people wanna see on screen
B	mm
A	you know they wanna see all this difficult stuff that people have to go through but for the producer they're not creative like that they just need one main trajectory that they can say this guy knows that this is the most propelling one that is going to make it believable
B	mm
A	for an audience so that's the type of thing that you know I would say
B	do you do the twin one? do you do the hero and the heroine?
A	yeah yeah you would plot both
B	mm
A	you'd
B	mm
A	antagonist hero heroine and sometimes what you'll find is that you have something inverse arc so you might start up over here and it's going down like that you know and so
B	mm
A	some people might say okay that means that something negative is happening and then it picks up I don't really care which way you look at it
B	uhu
A	the point is that it needs to
B	mm
A	it needs to show that kind of arc and it's nice if you can plot it out say you know if you break it down and your favourite film just any film and go okay
B	mm
A	plotted normally there's a jump here and this is the bit where things get hard cos normally around about here you need to start erm getting your denouement or the denouement
B	mm
A	you know the brown here
B	mm
A	get that bit so what they do is that they start having to I suppose
B	recap
A	recap or make it slower
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A suggests to make it slower	Entailment
A	but because audiences don't understand it they need an explanation but as soon as you start trying to explain something to audiences either
B	yeah
A	they fall into I'm actually I'm quite intelligent and I don't need
B	mm
A	it explained to me or I'm still too thick to understand this
B	well it's like a joke if you've to explain it it's no good
A	right exactly
B	mm
A	thank you that's
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A can't really understand it	Entailment
B	but
A	exactly it
B	the erm
A	don't explain it yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Speaket A says not to explain the rules of the game	Neutral
B	the plotline
A	yeah
B	runs in two parallel threads the virus and the
A	uhu
B	the virus thing almost comes to an end you think oh they've solved that problem the animal rights nutters have all been
A	uhu uhu
B	erm and then they discover that the virus is still a threat because it's got out of the labs through this raid
A	uhu uhu
B	it's had an antigenic shift and it's
A	uhu
B	developed into something that's quite nasty
[ANNOTATION]	It runs in two parallel threads the virus and the cure	Neutral
A	uhu
B	but it only affects darkies
A	uhu
B	or
A	uhu
B	over exposed people
A	uhu
B	erm
A	uhu okay so that's when the it's this is when the countdown
[ANNOTATION]	It only affects brighties	Contradiction
B	yeah
A	starts ticking?
B	well I mean the clock's
A	yeah
B	ticking all the way
[ANNOTATION]	The clock is ticking half way through	Contradiction
A	yeah but this is when the audience feel an uplift of
B	yeah
A	kind of you know right okay I've got to pay attention now
B	jeez I've got to sit on the edge of my seat now
A	yeah exactly
B	cos something's gonna happen
A	yes that's right yeah
B	and then the denouement
A	yeah
B	the bomb goes off
A	yeah
B	everything's oh fuck
A	yeah
B	that's the end of it
A	yeah
B	but it's not
A	no
B	cos actually
A	right okay yeah
B	the technology and the chase is
A	yes
B	quite sedentary I mean there's no car chases or helicopters or snipers or
A	yeah
B	whatever
A	yeah
B	it's all done with stationary CCTV cameras around London
A	okay alright yeah I get you yeah
B	er and local knowledge of the local plod
A	yeah
B	and they manage to bag these two guys
A	uhu
B	at the end there's a bit of excitement with the heroine
A	uhu
B	erm who dresses up as a prostitute to lure this guy
A	uhu
B	out into the open so that they can bag him
A	uhu uhu
B	and they do and in so doing they infect this bugger with the virus
A	right okay
B	and then they allow him to see his brief
A	right
B	and these people from the embassy
A	right
B	and whatever
A	yeah yeah yeah so
B	erm
A	he's
B	so he's
A	right okay
B	transmitting the virus to the right people
A	yeah yes yeah
B	and then they take him into prison to keep him in custody erm they cure him
A	right
B	er
A	yeah
B	which is totally illegal but they're gonna do it anyway
A	yeah
B	to get names and whatever out of him
A	yeah
B	and er at the end of the book they turn around and say well see there's another
A	that's so true
A	but normally the denouement as well is when somebody is about to you're you're gonna get that
B	mm
A	yeah so there's that sense of
B	mm
A	maybe in a way the heightened bit is is the bomb
B	mm
A	it's about here I'm just pulling it back
B	yeah
A	a bit and then the rest of it plays out as
B	mm
A	you explained you know but I think this is where we we see erm there's a change of gear and the audience are meant to engage brain at this stage
B	mm
A	to start trying to guess who's the bad guy who's the real bad guy who's really to blame
B	well they know that all along they know who the real bad guy is
A	right
B	but they don't know how he's gonna get caught
A	right okay so where do you present that part? which part of it for you is they know the audience knows is it in the first act?
B	the audience know about here
A	who it is?
B	who the bad guy is
A	okay
B	yeah
A	as that's the bad guy and people knowing
B	the villain
A	yeah it's the villain okay
B	er because you're you're you are following as part of the one of the threads in the book the bomb plot from the villain's point of view
A	yeah okay yeah
B	you've got that running parallel
A	yeah
B	to the police activity
A	okay
B	you've got that running parallel to the virus activity
A	yeah
B	you've got that parallel to the love affair between the
A	so
B	heroine and
A	it's like their cars coming to er wards each other you know
B	yeah
A	their cars are set on a trajectory
B	mm
A	you know what the game is
B	mm
A	it's gonna be chicken it's either you know yeah you're gonna miss each other
B	mm
A	and someone's gonna get away the villain's gonna get away or
B	mm
A	or both of them put the brakes on because they just don't wanna die you know I guess it's that win lose
B	mm
A	you know prisoner game or whatever it is
B	mm
A	so yeah that that also goes into the treatment so in a way erm the
B	mm
A	you're actually showing somebody this character arc or characters
B	mm
A	because you'll have both erm
B	oh no you're hungry aren't you?
A	and you can always know if you've put too much information in because you can say break it down into a two hour film
B	mm
A	here again let's say
B	yeah
A	thirty minutes
B	yeah
A	so you can kind of know if you're over writing on one bit
B	mm
A	you can say this is my thirty pages this is really good to get you started what even just thinking about time
B	mm
A	to read that book but as soon as you're in the cinema this is how long this film is you're gonna sit down and watch the whole bloody thing yeah? that's how it goes and people are paying their money for that so in your first thirty pages let's say you've got a first thirty minutes of the film I've marked it there
B	mm
A	each minute something bloody interesting is happening but you know that this is the most interesting minute
B	mm
A	and that's the next interesting minute and these are the points you mark in your treatment in your script of course you have to write all the
B	but thing is that erm in this character arc of the hero
A	uhu
B	for example erm finding out about the bad guy happens in America
A	uhu
B	one of their drones picks him up cos he's using a bloody sim card
A	right
B	in the Pakistani mountains
A	right
B	erm
A	that's that's fine yeah
B	he gets it beamed back to him as an email
A	okay
B	and they turn round and say well we've just done facial recognition on this guy
A	right
B	er the CIA's computers have come up and said he's so and so
A	yeah
B	last seen at the Nairobi bombings
A	right okay
B	and then aha
A	yeah alright
B	nice we'll put him on the on the
B	on the white board
A	yes yeah yeah
B	er the other guy we can't identify the picture wasn't clear enough
A	right okay
B	erm
A	okay
B	he comes to light through a prostitutes' ring
A	right
B	which was running through the job centre
A	right okay yeah no on this this is all great and this is all makes sense because what you're what you're telling me in a way is cause and effect seems like the way you talk about things is this is gonna be leading to this and then that we'll have that
B	mm
A	and it's all a knock on
B	mm
A	it's all a knock on so this is the sort of plot detail
B	mm
A	and then I think what you need to do is just as I say you need to like pick out those most important
B	mm
A	that's what a treatment is a treatment deals with brevity
B	mm
A	and it is succinct I mean it but it means the same thing but you know what I mean so these things are quite hard to pull out particularly when you have written a book you've in the process of rewriting your book you're thinking about writing a film script from it you know these characters so well that sometimes it's very hard to choose which part is the most important
B	yeah
A	part so that's why somebody like myself could when you're if you wanna go ahead with it could start to actually go okay you've given me shitloads of detail but the bit that I think if you agree
B	mm
A	and you discuss it with me let's put this in as the most important thing let's then move on to this bit but that takes a little bit of discussion from the scriptwriter
B	mm
A	what is the most important thing for this thirty minutes? what's the next thirty minutes and the next thirty minutes and the next thirty minutes?
B	but there may be two important things happen in the first thirty minutes
A	yeah yeah and that's when you have to say I can argue at the beginning there's something that's important
B	well there's two things driving this guy one is
A	yeah
B	the loss of his wife and the other one's his sense of justice
A	yeah
B	there's two things happening along this line the virus and the bomb threat
A	yeah yeah which is your plotline
B	which is your plotline
A	yeah
B	erm there are two characters involved
A	yeah
B	driven a lot of this plotline through totally different directions
A	yes yeah so you might have
B	a civilian and a
A	right
B	erm
A	yeah
B	erm
A	yeah
B	terrorists that have been snuck into the country to do
A	yeah
B	erm
A	mm mm it is not easy to do when you know the story inside and out
B	mm
A	and you know the characters
B	mm
A	deciding which teeth you know which tooth is that I need to take it
B	which one's got the gold in it?
A	yeah
A	basically yeah
B	mm
A	that's that's exactly it extracting the the tooth with gold in it yeah I like that I think that's a really good way of remembering
B	mm
A	er
B	mm
A	position to to do that but I would certainly say I can show you a treatment sometimes the treatment can help if you've seen the film and you know the film really well
B	I mean the problem I have
A	okay so
B	erm
A	a lot of things on the internet these days
B	yeah
A	have been put up there so you can have one of your favourite films that I bet you has got the treatment up there I bet you it's got the film script up there I'll bet you anything it has
B	well it
A	yeah
B	it's a bloody old film the one the one that I think is probably the most significant films I used to use it for management training
A	uhu which was that?
B	er Twelve O'Clock High
A	no I haven't seen it
B	black and white American war film
A	okay
B	about the flying fortresses flying over Germany and
A	okay
B	discipline and
A	brilliant
B	it's great
A	yeah so could you try and
B	and you've got this
A	plot
B	you've got this
A	plot it?
B	you've got this real evil bastard and an American air force general saying you know
A	right
B	erm I'm just taking over this squadron cos they're all tired and they're getting shot out of the sky every day and
A	yeah
B	er the outgoing general's saying well you know you've got to give them a break cos they're really you know out of it and they're tired
A	uhu
B	and he's going I'm not giving them a fucking break they've got a bloody job to do
A	yeah
B	get up there and do it and I'm gonna train them to be able to do the best job possible
A	right okay
B	er
A	yeah
B	and you've got these two fields of thoughts that are
A	right
B	either poor little boys you know
A	yeah yeah
B	they're
A	no no they're bloody soldiers you know
B	they're soldiers get up there
A	yeah trained to kill
B	they've been trained to be killed
A	yeah
A	oh trained to be killed yeah exactly yes
B	it's what we pay them for
B	mm
A	you know? so I would still say that you could watch a film again
B	mm
A	we could watch it together I might plot it
B	mm
A	differently from you
B	I mean I have erm
A	you know
B	I have er er a plethora of films I could name as being some of the worst films I've ever seen and the worst film I've seen in probably five years has been The Monument Men
A	I haven't seen it
B	er George Clooney and I mean it looks like a bunch of Hollywood actors that were running out of money running out of erm job offers who sat down in a café one day and said well let's make a film
A	The Monument Men
B	let's make it out of erm let's make it all about Nazi Germany and treasure
A	oh okay
B	erm
A	so we've got Monument versus what was it called? twelve high noon? what was your favourite film?
B	twelve o'clock
A	twelve o'clock
B	twelve o'clock
A	Twelve O'Clock High okay so what we could do is if you got that I could watch that I'd like to watch that
B	well I'll get it on the internet it's it's on the
A	okay
B	internet it's a black and white it's it's
A	well we can download it yeah
B	donkey's old
A	yeah how what what nineteen fifties?
B	nineteen fifty-two something like that it's Cary Grant and erm
A	oh I love the sound of that Cary Grant and Rock Hudson wonderful and then you do erm plot a shit film and then what you would do
B	mm
A	is you'd discuss it and go
B	I mean this film's filmed in the dark so they don't have to have any background no scenery no nothing
B	they erm have taken a couple of photographs out of the archives off the internet showing an American soldier stood in a church full of crates of looted artwork
A	how rubbish
B	totally spurious bloody committee of so called experts which justifies having old men in uniform
A	right
B	erm to try and fathom out what the Germans have done with their looted artwork and the history is wrong
A	yeah yeah as it often is
B	the history
A	yeah
B	is totally wrong
A	in Hollywood they have no
B	I mean
A	care
B	they've turned round and said well yeah okay I mean I know the history I've been to the places
A	yeah
B	Mauthausen er
A	yeah
B	where they built the V2 rockets
A	yeah
B	erm was where they stored the German Bundesbank
A	right
B	that's where
A	oh okay
B	er that's where they found the Reichsbank
A	oh right
B	er money
A	is that where they found it?
B	sackfuls of
A	okay
B	bloody gold and
A	I didn't know that
B	cases full of bullion
A	yeah
B	were all found there and yet they are saying that this was spread out all over the country in different caves all over the place
A	cos it suits them
B	and they're going
A	to be travelling around the country
B	just
A	just
B	wanted to travel around Germany
A	yeah exactly
B	to yeah
A	in cars
B	erm I just
A	I suppose yeah
B	thought fuck it
A	yeah
B	I can't
A	it's rubbish
B	be bothered
A	yeah
B	with this
A	yeah
B	and then they
A	so you didn't even watch the end then?
B	no
A	no yeah
B	and
A	that's what I'm like these days
B	just
A	life's too short if the film's shit I just won't watch it
B	just
A	yeah
B	turned it off about two thirds of the way through
A	yeah
A	don't wanna know
B	don't wanna know how it ends
A	yeah
B	it's totally irrelevant
A	yeah exactly
B	I mean
A	yeah
B	they couldn't even get the erm
A	yeah
B	wherever Amsterdam
A	and couldn't even get that right
B	erm
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	it just it's just so shoddy
B	and you know and there's this
A	these people are meant to be professional filmmakers
B	absolute I mean I I
A	yeah
B	bought I actually bought the DVD I threw it away
A	yeah
B	I threw it away
A	yeah you were just
B	I I felt disgusted
A	so angry with it
B	I was so angry with it
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	but the erm
A	yeah
B	or we'd like to make some more money
A	well probably more
B	or let's have some fun
A	like erm some
B	we're bored
A	some some producers
B	we haven't got any offers
A	got some money from
B	mm
A	somewhere and they said right we'll quickly make a film we don't really care if it's shit let's just spend it cos sometimes
B	mm
A	that's what they do
B	yeah
A	and that's why a lot
B	yeah I think that was it
A	of pants films anyway I've got to go
B	alright
A	but what we can do is we can work on this
B	mm
A	when you when you want to I mean I'm quite I'm quite intrigued about all of this now you've got me really hooked in about you know of course the plot but I'm really interested in the character formation the arc you know I think it
B	yeah I mean if you can send me if you can send me an example of a treatment
A	yeah yeah okay yeah
B	mail it to me
A	yeah yeah yeah I will
B	mm
A	send you the treatment
B	yeah but it's a
A	it's the structure
B	I'm looking at
A	yeah yeah but you might look at it and go how the hell am I meant to condense my whole entire film into three or four pages? and how you do it is by going through this type of process
B	uhu
A	that's how you break it down and that's why each paragraph is here you know the paragraphs are dotted along these trajectories paragraphs are not actually plotlines er plot points
B	no but
A	in a treatment
B	that heading is a plot
A	yes
B	I mean what I find what I find difficult I mean it's sort of running the things through my head now is I've got seventy chapters
A	yes
B	some of them are very short
A	yeah
B	but seventy chapters in two hours if I say there'll be two minutes a chapter
A	yeah yeah
B	you know we're looking at
A	yeah it's not gonna work yeah
B	no it's gonna be too long
A	yeah so that's why bits of
B	mm
A	chapters will not appear in the film
B	mm
A	but that's why you have to be clear in your mind and so that you can actually convince a producer
B	I mean this is the thing
A	that you know this
B	where you have to make a judgement is is
A	yeah
B	is something visually vital to capture the imagination? er or is it plot vital?
A	okay I know the answer to that always go visual you always because
B	mm
A	the medium of film
B	mm
A	is visual
B	yeah
A	and audio er audio
B	mm
A	you always go on the visual
B	mm
A	you err on the side of visual you never go with plotline
B	mm
A	very quickly you know that
B	mm
A	why? because actually they read the way that they look at the screen is that they can pick up so much information it normally
B	mm
A	the eye goes in this kind of clockwise
B	mm
A	so your
B	mm
A	you can put in so much information on the visual side
B	yeah
A	that people can see depth of field they can see the actor they can see periphery
B	mm
A	and you don't need to explain it
B	no
A	that's what I mean don't explain the plots
B	no
A	just put in the visual
B	well it's a bit like writing the book itself
A	yeah
B	except show it don't don't tell it
A	exactly yeah
B	mm
A	and the dialogue is the force
B	mm
A	yeah that's really what keeps the momentum going with obviously some you know
B	but you know it's
A	happen along the way
B	the thing's gotta be interesting the characters have gotta be interesting there's gotta be friction there there's gotta be
A	yeah
B	electricity there
A	yeah yeah
B	the whole thing and you
A	yeah
B	I've seen films that were er
A	yeah
B	they could have been really good
A	yeah but they didn't really get this
B	but they didn't gel because
A	bit right
B	the actors just
A	yeah
B	it was like they were being filmed
A	yeah like
B	in different studios or on different
A	two yeah that's right
B	sides of the mountain
A	yeah you're on you're doing one side
B	and then
A	over here
B	like
A	that's right and then do me
B	put them together
A	that's why and if you can get your protagonist antagonist
B	mm
A	luring each other in a really
B	mm
A	really tight knit way that makes for a very harnessed
B	mm
A	bit of interaction
B	mm
A	between you know people so or transaction should I say?
B	yeah
A	cos sometimes it is a transaction and it's the games people play a lot of the time scripts writers who are starting out want to talk about motivation inner and external
B	mm
A	it's game playing if you understand the game theory this is the big game that's being played in your world the world
B	yeah
A	that you create everyone wants to play the game and everybody wants to win
B	mm
A	and that's what you're showing the audience
B	mm
A	yeah
B	the goodies and the baddies
A	yeah
B	and then we've got this er sideline of these very bad bugs that could get
A	yeah
B	get in and survive
A	yeah
B	erm which one's gonna get you first?
A	yes exactly and that's what it is
B	and that's the race
A	and that could be your tagline
B	yeah
B	you see you just said it and I'm glad we're recording this because often we can't write fast enough
B	mm
A	to get the creative
B	mm
A	lines coming out but that's your tagline
B	yeah
A	that would be your elevator pitch
B	yeah
A	cos what he'd say like what? who? what? and then he'll ask you again because you said it so succinctly
B	mm
A	they actually then ask you questions
B	mm
A	but if you're going on too long they start to phase off
A	yeah exactly so the shorter the better
B	have to stay on
A	yeah exactly
B	there
A	anyway I've gotta go haven't I mm? do you mind filling in my consent form?
B	erm am I old enough to sign this?
A	oh I don't know
B	er right
A	I'm just gonna pop to the toilet
B	second of March isn't it?
A	yeah second of March
B	ah second of
