A	right so basically er he he was the
A	I I know it's it's Italian cos like he was in the mafia basically
B	oh okay
A	and and what the what the
B	what's the game called?
A	Town of Salem
B	oh yeah you've been playing that for years haven't you?
A	no not years for a while like
B	but that's that's the one isn't it? where you
A	yeah and it's fun cos each time you play the game you get a random role
B	yeah
A	erm but basically what a
B	yeah
A	and the investigator what they can do is they check a target each night and they can find two or three possible roles that that target is so for example if a target was a serial killer see there's loads of roles but if the target was a serial killer the investigator would get your targets covered in blood they're either a doctor a vampire or a serial killer
B	oh charming
A	so you you have to guess which one they are based on like other people getting information erm but the
B	yeah
A	so they they're more powerful than the investigator but they're also on the bad side so
B	ah not so good
A	but they can
B	didn't you always used to get killed off in this though really early?
A	not not all the time I I had bad luck yesterday though I I had some weird games I had one game where
B	using what?
A	bots
B	bots
A	yeah
B	as in robots?
A	yeah so someone was using a bot or something and they were doing something weird like I dunno if they were hacking or whatever but they were doing something weird with the game
B	mm
A	and basically there's this role called the mayor which might be obvious cos it's a town but erm
B	it just seems like
A	no not really what what's confusing you?
B	everything
A	well I I don't I don't I don't see how
B	well you've just said that something comes up and it can be the three different things
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	the mayor will appear to the investigator as either the mayor the godfather or the vampire hunter because the mayor doesn't get the exact role
B	okay
A	which is why the major has to
B	okay so what's actually what's the best role to have?
A	oh it
B	is it?
A	what the spy can do is they can read mafia chat but they can't actually see who the members of the mafia are cos that would just be overpowered
B	is that like helpful at all?
A	it is it is helpful erm because you can
B	yeah
A	so if you if you think someone's typing a certain way you think oh I've been reading mafia chat this person types exactly like someone in the mafia I think they're a member of the mafia
B	yeah okay
A	that has worked
B	yeah
A	also some people are a bit silly probably cos they're new and sometimes they end up saying their names not realising that there's a spy in the game
A	I've I've done I haven't done that I have done something stupid though erm
A	erm basically one time the godfather got jailed the first night and I went oh no the godfather's jailed and there was a spy and they said whoever you jailed first night was the godfather I'm like
A	I was like I I
B	I think what you were saying about erm watching how people type
A	yeah I
B	they're voice but in
A	yeah
B	text
A	yesterday yesterday was funny because erm I was actually an executioner and the executioner is
B	boo hiss
A	the executioner is a neutral role but the a neutral evil role so
A	because because
B	okay it just seems a bit screwy to me but go on I'll I'll
A	they they they're neutral because they don't really have allegiances with anyone in particular just they just have a vendetta against that one person that they want to get lynched
B	okay
A	erm that's why they're neutral and that's why they're evil at the same time because they're trying to get a member of the town lynched
B	oh right
A	that appears
B	yeah
A	erm and I noticed that in the death note they had spelt something incorrectly they spelt only as onely basically
A	I don't know I don't know I don't know if their first language is English
B	well maybe not
A	maybe not but
B	maybe they're more dyslexic than I am
A	maybe but I I was half joking but half not joking and I basically said I basically said oh you know they misspelt this in their death note and this person can't spell their name coincidence? I think not erm and and and
B	theory
A	no it's a stupid line of reason that's what I was looking for
B	oh okay
A	and I didn't think it was erm but then that person
B	yay
C	oh yeah er by the way er
A	yeah
C	just just just a warning just in case my mood is shit for the next
B	okay
C	so yeah er sorry if I'm a bit moody
B	is that what she warned you might happen it might get worse before it gets better?
C	yeah I mean that that's what happened the first time I took them
B	mm
C	er the subsequent times I took them it wasn't so bad but this is the biggest gap that I've had between
B	okay so what what warnings did she give you about it?
C	she said that er
B	cos it sounds like quite a new med
C	it it's exactly the same type of med that I was on before
B	yeah
C	erm so it I I don't think it works any differently
B	yeah
C	erm yeah she just said that I might feel a bit nauseous in the first few days which didn't ever actually happen to me before and that erm er my levels of you know agitation and anxiety will will probably go up er I think
B	yeah so it's gonna get worse before it gets better
A	yeah
B	okay well
A	but that should only last a couple of weeks if if that
B	just just be aware that you know if you're being a complete and utter
C	oh yeah I know
B	and you know to go up to your room not sent up to your room like a naughty little boy but somewhere where you can calm down so hopefully you'll be on top of it by Christmas
C	hopefully it's only
B	yeah it's gonna be
C	it's only nine days
B	yeah it's gonna be erm
C	need to get some wrapping paper actually
B	oh yeah but I can't see any that I like
C	mm
B	Sainsbury's
C	yeah
A	wrapping paper?
B	yeah
A	well I picked it I didn't buy it
B	no I know you didn't buy it I think erm
C	have to have to have to ask dad to fund that cos I've got no money I'll have some
B	well that'll be plenty of time won't it?
C	when the
B	yeah that that'll be in time he's gonna send me some money for a taxi tomorrow
C	that's good
B	well it is it would have been
A	yeah but that doesn't mean that at least he's given you a way to get there instead of just
B	oh yeah yeah no no that's fine
A	that's yeah that's fine
B	yeah that's that's fine
C	yeah yeah that's fine yeah yeah that's fine
B	but it doesn't look that difficult to get to on the bus actually
C	what to
B	yeah but I mean all told the journey takes about forty minutes
A	I would just take a taxi personally
C	what do you do? do you get do you get the bus into?
B	oh no I'll take a taxi tomorrow I I won't take the chance then
C	what what what do you do do do you get the bus into
B	no erm opposite way bus into
C	oh
B	and then get the bus erm I think it said the bus heading towards
C	oh okay
B	erm the bus bus went into erm oops
A	mm
B	but I was speaking to you your dad about you know
A	ah no no no
B	no I
A	that that is
B	but it's
A	sounds like it sucks
B	it did suck it was hard work and then on the way back because the buses stop running in the village at seven o'clock and I didn't finish work until eight
A	mm
B	so it actually is about forty minutes all told on the bus including all bus journeys you know completely
A	what this one now or?
B	the the one now
A	okay
B	yeah so it should actually be quicker
A	yeah isn't even though it's further away isn't it?
B	erm no it's just
A	mm I mean I know I haven't been doing twelve hour shifts or anything but that's one thing I'm gonna miss about living on campus second year is the fact that I can have extra sleep and it only takes me fifteen minutes to get to to my lessons at most but when I'm gonna be living off campus I'm gonna have to get up early actually walk to the bus stop wait for the bus get a bus there and then I'm not going to just be able to go back in between lessons to have a nap
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	you know your shift and what have you if you had time to have that because it was often so busy on the ward you often didn't actually get a break
A	yeah
B	you know I mean legally you we're supposed to have a break but you often didn't have a break there's erm an in house joke about nurses having bladders like bin liners
A	no
B	you know so you you go hours and hours and hours I know that I have gone
A	mm
B	you know I've been busting to go but you just get kind of used to it I suppose
A	yeah probably
B	but then sometimes you end up with pains in your tummy you know those horrible pains you get in your tummy when you you need to go
A	yeah
B	when you're busting for a wee
A	yeah
A	mm
B	but yeah so hopefully anyway getting backtracking to what we were saying hopefully your dad'll help me out getting there and back
A	hopefully
B	because when when you know like on bank holidays and what have you when the buses weren't running that early in the morning
A	that's a lot
B	it's a lot of money to get to work that's like three hours' pay
A	mm
B	you know so I might as well I said to them I said I might as well just not come in until ten o'clock
A	weren't they alright with that though? didn't didn't they say that was okay
B	no no no no you can't you can't do that they were alright for me to get in
A	oh okay
B	erm on on a Sunday and they were okay with that
A	mm
B	erm and get in the car but sometimes I wouldn't get a lift it was sometimes I wouldn't actually get in the car because there was a lot of erm
A	mm
B	you know it it's dangerous
A	mm
B	we'll see what happens I haven't got the job yet
A	no but it's good to think ahead maybe try and think more optimistically
B	I have been so optimistic
A	yeah
B	guy I spoke to on the phone didn't get that job erm but I think I didn't get that job because I have too many skills
A	what so they think you're overqualified?
B	I'm definitely overqualified
A	yeah it kinda sucks though because I I appreciate that employers don't want people who are overqualified cos maybe they feel that they won't be challenged enough or something like that
B	yeah
A	but er obviously they're looking for a job they're desperate for a job if they're looking for positions where they're overqualified so I I don't know it it feels
B	yeah because you also know that they can do the job
A	yeah and instead you're gonna
B	yeah and they would be good at it
A	instead you're gonna be hiring someone who isn't as qualified but you think maybe won't get as bored I don't know if that's their thinking?
B	actually you know that's that's a very good point because the guy that I was just telling you about
A	yeah
B	other other than a job
A	yeah
B	and he said and I don't know what I've got to offer you
A	I know I mean I don't know I I I thought it was too late to apply for any temporary job here anyway so I haven't bothered erm but you you you know how people say oh no one's too good to work in Mcdonald's or something like that
B	yeah
A	I mean I mean there's an obvious reason why I wouldn't but
B	I've never heard that but carry on
A	I I've heard it a lot of times I mean there's there's one obvious reason why I wouldn't work in Mcdonald's now erm
B	you're not spotty enough
A	erm that's not what I was thinking but
B	slap my wrist
A	yeah but but but okay yeah okay
B	I I was only joking I was only yeah I didn't mean it
A	but I would I would feel I would get so bored
B	yeah
A	if I was to work in Mcdonald's
B	see now that's the way to look at it and that's the way I have to look at it with doing these care home jobs
A	yeah but I
B	sometimes you have to start right at the bottom and work your way up
A	I know I'm just saying I I would apply sooner to go and work in a grocery store rather than at Mcdonald's
B	I would be actually quite happy to work in a grocery store
A	why don't you apply for jobs at grocery stores?
B	cos I did one of their stupid online assessment things that said to me no
A	oh oh I hate I hate
B	actually I should get you to do the Tesco's one with me
A	you that's not well you're not meant to you're meant to do it on your own
B	yeah I know that but
A	no no but the thing is right I did it one time did it fine you know I got the interview at
A	I was thinking I was thinking
B	I I actually would agree with you on that one I think he was because he did sound to me like he was erm looking at what was best for you as well
A	yeah it was a bit disappointing but I'm over it but anyway I
B	yeah
A	and then they said oh you haven't reached the interview stage cos your questions weren't good enough my
B	yeah I I've read online about erm
A	it it
B	one one girl said that she sent in
A	it it's stupid they must do it randomly and that that that that's unfair though because oh
B	exactly
A	but all I don't know how they would combat that but besides the fact that I got an interview with a set of questions then entered the exact same set of questions and then failed is a bit fishy
B	it's ridiculous yeah it's ridiculous isn't it?
A	I I don't know what they expect people to do if they get an interview with one set of answers and then get rejected with the same set of answers well what do you want what do you want from me?
B	I know I know
A	I think I'm just gonna try and get do some volunteering or try and get an internship
B	yeah
A	you know psychology-related try and get experience with that rather than looking for particular for a paid job because I'm gonna need experience erm
B	yeah
A	so I
B	I think actually I think that's a very sensible idea
A	I I I need to focus on that first
B	yeah
A	erm I mean I did see a few that were quite
B	I think you mentioned it yeah
A	one about erm
B	mm
A	and F M FMRI I'm not sure what FMRI is
B	yeah
A	but they said one of the requirements is that you needed good knowledge of the anatomy of the brain and I don't
B	well you have haven't you?
A	no
B	mm
A	like I got you you know?
B	yeah
A	the developmental one was okay but developmental psychology really isn't what interests me
B	yeah
A	yeah that's why it's interesting me
B	do you think do you think you'd be more interested now than rather than
A	mm
B	in helping particularly people with anxiety depression stuff like that
A	I think so
B	yeah
A	because
B	oh yeah? and what why is that then?
A	er I'm trying to remember exactly what it was
B	okay
A	basically er there's a protein I can't remember the name of it though it it I think the the abbreviation I think is APP
B	okay
A	and
B	I have no clue what that means but
A	it's
B	so where does this different component come from to
A	oh I don't know I'm sorry
B	okay well no I just wondered if if this had already been found in the research you were saying your tutor whatever he is is doing
A	I I don't I don't know exactly where the other protein come not other protein other enzyme comes from
B	yeah
A	the fragments can't be broken down and so they kind of aggregate together and form a pack and that prevents signals
B	from getting through
A	getting through effectively so that's one thing
B	so why I wonder then I'm not asking if you know the answer to this I'm just wondering now I wonder then how that affects
A	mm
B	how you know a thing is because they it's like their short-term memory
A	yeah
B	is non-existent but their long-term memory's fantastic
A	yeah I I I think that's what it is I think
B	yeah
A	oh
B	you know they they have no no idea and it also I don't know how true this is but when I was erm
A	yeah it can
B	so
A	yeah
B	very very distressing and uncomfortable and
A	yeah
B	because they're
A	mm
B	and
A	oh okay
B	and that must have been really hard for her
A	mm
B	but he used to tell me all these stories Scotsman he was and he had this really broad Scots accent and he used to be a shepherd up in the hills
A	mm
B	and he's go home and he'd take the sheep back to the house with him and all the sheep would be like coming in and in the lounge and things like that and his mum'd be going mad saying all tho
B	all over my floor get these bloody sheep out of here
A	mm
B	you know? which was
A	yeah it is sad it
B	yeah
A	well I'm just I'm just
B	yeah no that's fine
A	I'm I'm not trying to patronise you or anything
B	no just carry on
A	but I I just want to make sure we're on the same page
B	no you on sixteen and I'm on thirty-four
A	that's that's you're implying that I'm stupid
A	right erm within the neurons there's erm
B	okay
A	erm like they transport help transport signals and different the different what's the word? ions I'd say that
B	yeah
A	throughout the neuron erm these micro
B	easy for you to say
A	it's one it's one of those weird words erm
B	one of those ones you can say quite clearly in your head but you just cannot get out passed the tip of your tongue
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	but these I I'll try and say it again micro
B	yeah
A	no I've messed up the end oh well erm
B	never mind
A	those things
B	yeah
A	they get tangled
B	well with a name like that it's quite understandable isn't it?
A	ah they they get tangled and so
B	yeah
A	materials
B	properly?
A	properly ha they can't be transported throughout the neuron
B	uhu
A	and so the neuron ends up dying
B	oh
A	so there's billions and billions of neurons in our brain but you know if they start dying
B	well it depends at you know you might well think oh there's billions and billions
A	yeah and also
B	if if if you say they start dying and they start dying like
A	oh I I don't know the rate
B	it it it might be like they're dying by their thousands
A	I I don't know the rate at which they die I I mean
B	yeah it's insidious yeah
A	so
B	and there are stages to it as well
A	yeah yeah
B	okay
A	I I don't know what it is about that word that I just can't say
B	you do you do and then you know in a day or two's time it might just trip off your tongue
A	yeah
B	no but it what I could never understand is
A	because
B	I mean the effects are the same
A	yeah but I think it's cos
B	yeah
A	so I I I guess
B	so so many erm contributing factors
A	yeah I mean the the main difference with some types of dementia and Alzheimer's in that Alzheimer's is irreversible but you can get some types of dementia where if there's a particular physical symptom that you can identify you can reverse it
B	can you? I didn't know that
A	yeah no there are some types of dementia where that is the case I I I found that interesting actually erm
B	oh
A	erm but not with Alzheimer's cos Alzheimer's is specifically what was I talking about with the amyloid plaques and things
B	coconut oil
A	yeah just
B	but however it is actually meant to some people have said erm
A	I'm not
B	dot UK yeah
A	yeah er that that's what we were taught in primary school if it's got org in it it's a trustworthy website erm
B	right
A	so I I think so basically it says that there have been some claims that coconut oil could be used as a treatment or even a cure I doubt it
B	no I'm not saying a cure
A	but this is just what the website is saying
B	yeah
A	erm for Alzheimer's disease however there is currently not enough experimental evidence to back up these claims
B	which is exactly what I've just said isn't it?
A	I know I'm just reaffirming what you are saying
B	yeah
A	erm it it is saying the claim is based on the theory that the neurons erm in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease are unable to use glucose to produce energy properly and therefore starve and the theory is that coconut oil might act as an alternative energy source but there is not enough scientific evidence to know for sure whether this is the case erm and there is a clinical trial being conducted in the US
B	oh
A	it says the results of this clinical trial are due to be announced in mid two thousand seventeen
B	oh oh
C	is is is the dog not getting any tea today?
B	er I suppose we did say we would take the dog out so you really need to get dressed and you need to take her O U T down the road
A	did did dad leave my wellies here?
B	yes
C	yeah the both both pairs are in the kitchen
B	they're both yeah they're both in the kitchen
A	oh okay
B	so we get her down the road and better take a torch with us this time
C	I mean I would have done it myself but you know like
B	yeah
C	yeah he's got he's got an all-day meeting he's probably still in it
B	yeah probably
C	no what is like next door? or
B	no he's actually working from
C	yeah but is this the party at
B	yeah
C	they're having a they're having a work Christmas party at someone's
B	oh it's
C	oh
B	so it it they'll go to the pub
C	yeah but they they're they'll still probably
B	also yeah they'll go to the pub
C	yeah they'll still probably go out somewhere
B	yeah they they'll go to the pub which I think is within walking distance
C	probably probably going to
C	oh that's good
A	it's confusing hearing all these
B	I know
C	is it of our
B	no our
A	it was taken a few months ago I don't know why she took so long to put them up it was at her birthday party her being
C	god who are all these people?
A	oh god there's so many people so many names we need to remember
B	what what is that? oh
A	what's
B	share this and in five minutes you will find this in your yard
C	ten dollars?
A	well that's going to be useless here isn't it?
B	yeah it's no use to me is it?
C	er you know we have these things called er
B	if he goes into the garden soon we'll know why
C	yeah we have we have these things called erm you know bureau de change yeah you you you can get your money changed
A	okay smarty pants
B	just by changing their money?
A	well the
C	yeah
B	so if I go to the bureau de change or whatever it's called
A	great pronunciation
B	yeah shush
C	yeah yeah sorry we didn't take French cos we're not traitors
A	what do you mean traitors?
B	you learnt
A	alright fair enough
C	only cos I was made to
A	what do you mean you were made to
B	anyway anyway if I went there and changed some money I could automatically just be in a different country when I turn around
C	yeah yeah pretty much
B	oh right okay I like that right let let me find this picture of
C	oh rats there's no hundred dollars
A	oh no it's like
B	they lied they lied
A	was that was that mean to
C	yeah
A	how how come he's suddenly speaking in an American accent?
C	cos that's what he do sometimes
B	there
A	it's annoying
B	there it is
C	I know but oh I I don't know who
B	that one there's your sister
C	yeah I know
C	christ there's like everyone
A	there's
B	there's
A	there's only one really tall guy and that's
A	well actually I think she's slightly shorter than me she's just further in the front so she looks taller
B	oh it's just because
A	I mean I I look tiny don't I?
C	yeah
A	but mind you they're all they're most of them are guys so they're gonna be taller than me
C	yeah
B	not necessarily
A	well I mean there is
B	he doesn't look that tall
A	no he is quite short to be honest
A	no that's
C	this looks like he's been photoshopped in as well
A	no he hasn't he's erm he's he's a fourth year who was I think he was our block rep so he was the rep for all of house one
C	oh okay
A	erm yeah
B	ah
A	erm
B	it will be dark
A	I know that's okay
B	okey-dokey
A	I can handle the dark oh I keep losing my earphone things it keeps coming off it's annoying
B	I might might just walk her round the roads actually rather than just take her to erm the P A R K
A	yeah
B	then you won't have to worry about losing the ball
A	and then I won't have to wear wellies
B	and I won't have to wear wellies either
A	I do like those wellies though they're good
B	mm
A	they're quite nice they're yeah
B	mm
A	oh
B	if you wish
A	erm
B	yeah no that's fine
A	erm
B	I can't remember because as always as in any conversation
A	yeah well that's fine erm
B	oh yeah
A	glitched and that was really annoying because it was a
B	I have no idea it just sounds very cute
A	yeah erm most people they abbreviate it to
B	understandably
A	yeah erm
B	be right up
A	I was I was giving
B	why why would somebody want to be lynched? are they depressed or something?
A	no they're crazy erm
A	it's a fun it's a fun role to play it's so great when people actually think your bad and then you get lynched and then ha ha screw you guys and then you just kill someone
A	yeah and they have to
B	so do you
A	there was there was this one person that I'm trying to remember exactly what happened erm
B	do you change your name every time?
A	yeah you can if you want erm for some reason I like to call myself pieces of furniture like I've been chair I've been lamp I've been table
B	weird
A	yeah some people have weird names weirder than mine
B	I have a weird daughter
A	it's fine erm
B	okay so you're a bit like a virus?
A	kind of
B	okay
A	and so basically what happened was I got attacked by a werewolf but I got healed by the doctor so I didn't die but the doctor died instead and I think a sheriff or someone else also died because they visited me to check me and what it looked like it looked like I was a werewolf who stared at stayed at home and then killed the people who visited me
B	yeah I was gonna stay
A	and so people
B	yeah
A	but I was telling the truth though but erm what happened was
B	oh
A	cos they lynched me
B	no no no I think I think you're a secret psychopath
A	it's fun it's fun being the jester I do like it it's always annoying though because sometimes you can get killed at night and you're not meant to get killed at night as jester cos you don't win that way you have to get lynched erm you can get killed at night by the mafia or a serial killer or even a werewolf like one of them tried to do erm
B	yeah
A	erm
B	just turn the light on can't see you
A	what was I just saying?
B	erm you were saying
A	oh no I was talking about getting killed at night wasn't I?
B	yeah
A	it's annoying as jester sometimes because you can get killed at night without actually having a chance to get yourself lynched and that's just annoying that's just bad luck it happens
B	seems to me like all
A	yeah oh I had such bad luck yesterday cos I got the werewolf
B	mm
A	erm and werewolf I find werewolf a fun role and one time what I'd managed to do was lay low the entire game because I had just stayed at home and no one had visited me on full moons so I didn't attack anyone so no one knew that there was a werewolf in the game so I just
B	so do they not have the same characters in each each game?
A	no erm cos there's this game mode call all any and basically the role is just there's any so there can be any combination of roles
B	oh okay
A	so erm that's my favourite one because you can get so many different combinations it's quite fun
B	yeah it makes it a bit more challenging wouldn't it?
A	yeah erm
B	yeah
A	you know which sucks but
B	yeah
A	and it didn't really matter which one I got rid of erm because I would have won anyway
B	okay
A	so I could have got rid of the mafia first
B	yeah
A	and there was more evidence against the serial killer so I just you know I said I'm a survivor trust me you know this person's a serial killer they were the
A	yeah they they were the serial killer we lynched them and then it came up with the werewolf wins and everyone was like what we had a werewolf this game? and I was like yeah
B	yay go me
A	I was try I was trying to do the same thing just stay at my house and hope no one visits me
B	damn those vampires
A	no because this this happened twice I believe actually no it didn't it it happened once but I was thinking of something else erm
B	uhu
A	but certain roles are immune to being bitten so they
B	yeah
A	to erm
B	seems like quite a few
A	yeah I mean yeah there is quite a few that are immune but basically what the vampire'd done is they tried to bite me night one and I didn't know they tried to bite me cos they didn't actually say that I got attacked or anything
B	okay
A	erm
B	a vam wolf
A	and the vampire had written in their will cos when you die you present a will erm someone had written in the will oh this person was immune to me biting them and everyone was like oh what what are you why why are you immune to the vampire biting you? I said I I'm a survivor I used my vest that's why I was immune because survivors can use vests to protect themselves
B	yeah
A	but apparently er even if a survivor uses their vest they get bitten and they turn into vampire anyway I didn't know that I was trying to cover myself
A	yeah but that's
B	so when you were playing this with
A	no erm the first time when
A	yeah
A	so I said just wait it out
B	oh
A	it's annoying cos cos cos doctors can heal themselves once I was just frustrating that cos I didn't think I would use me heal for myself in the first in the first night but they ended up killing me so you know sucks erm
B	soon boo boos
A	but I I was tell I was telling
B	see at least one of my children has got scruples
A	no cos that
B	one of my twinnies
A	that's that's that's just the way you get lynched cos they think that he's an executioner
B	I remember you used to get quite frustrated on on this game sometimes you'd be like no no don't kill me don't kill me don't
A	it is
B	yeah
A	erm
B	no
A	no I know
B	really?
A	yeah
B	people cheat in games?
A	yeah no basically
B	wow
A	what people do is they'll be in Skype call and I know I was talking to
B	yeah
A	erm
B	as you should
A	but you get but you get some people who will Skype each other and they will tell them outside information
B	yeah
A	that they shouldn't know unless you like
B	yeah
A	but you can't do that that's that's cheating but
B	no
A	erm you know he he found out that someone was the godfather and he had no way of knowing that unless someone else had told him
B	uh die of guilt?
A	I think they kill themselves
B	ah
A	erm
B	yeah
A	however there are so many other people he could have shot
B	maybe he just doesn't like lamps
A	I don't think erm actually my name might no my name wasn't lamp that
B	what's that other game you used to play that always looked fun was that erm one with the bubble where you had to go round collecting more bubbles
A	oh Agar dot I O
B	yeah
A	yeah it's fun
B	cos that that they used to you used to be so funny watching you playing that
A	it's it's it's quite
B	go away go away no no don't come near me no go away right I'm going over here I'm hiding over here
A	always
B	no don't follow me go away
B	mm
A	erm cos it it's a fun game Town of Salem
B	it's nice isn't it when when you've got something that you actually really enjoy and you want to share it with somebody that that you love or somebody who's company you really like
A	mm
B	and you just want to share the same fun and get them to have the same fun and with you or what have you you know? that that's always nice I think I always used to find it quite disappointing when other people just didn't wanna play the same games as me
A	yeah
B	you know?
A	and he he did seem interested cos he was asking me questions about how to play it and things like that so it's not as if he was completely fobbing it off or anything I think he was just a bit confused and maybe a bit self-conscious cos he didn't want to mess up I warned him I said
B	okay
A	but cos one time I was playing
B	right
A	so let me try and explain this so let's say mafia target person A I decide to swap person A with person B
B	okay
A	so instead of person A dying person B dies cos I swap their places
B	okay
A	what had happened was I was a transporter the bodyguard and all protective roles were dead and the jailor was still alive so I was trying to protect the jailor and what I did is I swapped the jailor with a member of the mafia so that the mafia would kill themselves
B	okay
A	does that make sense?
B	yeah
A	what had happened was there was a vigilante in the game who I didn't know about they had not revealed that they were a vigilante what happened was the vigilante was planning to shoot the mafia member that I swapped the jailor with and so the vigilante ended up killing the jailer and so the vigilante died because the vigilante is not meant to kill town members they kill themselves out of guilt
B	right
A	and I got blamed for it because I moved them but I had no idea I had no way of knowing that he was going to shoot that guy then people didn't seem to acknowledge that
B	right
A	do you understand where I'm coming from?
B	yeah I do
A	I cos I I had no way if he had told me all he had to do was whisper me and say I'm going to shoot this person do not move them I I would have been like fine I won't move them I will move them with someone else
B	right
A	but he didn't he neglected to tell me and then I got blamed for it
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A thinks they are not to be blamed.	Entailment
B	yeah
A	erm I mean I can't I got a bit upset then because people
B	did you?
B	it's easy isn't it? I mean
A	I think I was
B	you do
A	I think I was feeling quite down as it was
B	yeah
A	and I think I was feeling a bit over sensitive and I I was playing that cos I I like to watch the stream to cheer myself up and I was playing it to cheer myself up and they kind of ruined it
B	yeah
A	because they were basically just calling me an idiot you know saying I ruined the game for them even though I hadn't it was also the vigilante not thinking about telling you know the obvious transporter in the game what they were doing
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A was feeling quite happy before playing the game.	Contradiction
A	oh I don't
B	yeah
B	it's kind of
B	are you alright?
A	yeah
B	yeah?
A	sometimes when I talk too much my throat gets dry and then I end up coughing
B	yeah so does mine
A	no I'm okay
B	yeah?
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A sometimes watches people playing games.	Entailment
A	I think I was also getting mad because I was getting mad and upset because they weren't seeing it from my point of view they they're they're only thinking oh this transporter messed it up because the vigilante was shooting but they didn't consider that I had no idea what the vigilante was doing I had no way of knowing
B	yeah
A	it's like if I had a way of knowing he had if he had told me and I did it anyway then I would understand why people called me an idiot
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A would have acted differently had they known about the vigilante's course of action.	Entailment
A	but there was no indication what he was doing
B	oh
A	so I
B	but looking back on it you you know I'm sure you can kind of look back on it and think why on earth did I ever get upset over that?
A	I mean yeah and you know later on cos I was saying you know I
B	mm
A	you know I was kind of saying that you've kind of ruined my night now because you've just kept calling me an idiot you know even though it wasn't really my fault
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A was called an idiot but he did not know what they were going to do.	Entailment
B	yeah
A	and it wasn't the person on the stream by the way calling me an idiot by the way he's nice I think he just also got frustrated because he wasn't expecting me to move erm the people and you know erm but he said he said don't worry you know you did the best with the information you had and you didn't you know he admitted that he hadn't said anything
B	perhaps erm he just had a plan in his head and it didn't go the way he wanted it to go
A	obviously
B	and he didn't like it you know so
A	but you you you know it's a
B	well tough luck really isn't it?
A	yeah
B	have you seen these things on Facebook it says if you could sit on this bench and chat with only one person past or present who would it be?
A	er I've probably seen something like that
B	who would it be?
A	oh I have no idea erm
B	no neither do I
A	I I don't know I don't know anyone past who when you say past does it imply that maybe they're dead?
B	they're dead? I suppose that's what it implies but it doesn't have to be it could just be someone you knew in the past
A	maybe
B	no
A	or maybe I'd talk to someone when they were younger maybe if they were quite old now maybe I'd speak to them when they're younger
B	oh that's a different way of looking at it
A	oh I don't know if they're not dead maybe they're just old now and then you could go back in the past and speak to them
B	but it could be somebody that you went to school with
A	maybe there's no one in particular that I went to school with either that I would speak to not that I don't still speak to now
B	well yeah I'm exactly the same I kind of think I have there is no one particular person that I would want to sit and just chat with
A	and then it said then did it did it say future?
B	no
A	no?
B	oh now that's a good one
A	cos he you know is quite funny and yeah
B	yeah and he's quite he's got quite a lot of wisdom as well
A	I do I do
B	it is a shame
A	I think he was also depressed
B	which kind of comes hand in hand with Parkinson's
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	mm
B	I actually think she's got more than one thing going on
A	mm mm don't know
B	do you know what I found interesting about the fact that you're interested in the neurological side of things
A	what?
B	I wanted at one point to
A	mm
B	and do neurology
A	I I mean I I do find it I find it very interesting I think maybe cos I'm more
B	yeah
A	erm I do yeah and
B	you're quite you you're quite intuitive as well so
A	yeah
B	don't lose your intuition
A	no I no I won't there's yeah there's been countless times I I I'm kind of going like there's been countless times in the game where I have felt something really strongly but have not acted on it cos I was afraid that I was gonna be wrong but actually I was correct
B	yeah
A	yeah I I was just giving an example
B	yeah you know so you're more you're more spiritual than I think you'd like to admit because you don't want to people to think you're a bit cuckoo
B	yeah? am I right or wrong
A	maybe a bit
B	yeah you get to you get to a stage even if it takes you fifty-three years where you think I really don't give a monkey what you think
A	mm
B	that hurts you know they damn well use that gift enough
A	yeah
B	that damn well hurts you know
A	I mean but it's not
B	but you do get to the stage
A	it's like when erm
B	yeah
A	and you know especially in secondary school I'm I'm pretty certain there was a group of girls in particular who thought I was a snob because I did
B	that was probably true
A	but
B	no
A	but they they seemed to assume that and I I didn't think that was fair because they had never actually spoken to me or seen what I was like and the fact
B	yeah
A	yeah make an arse out of you and me yeah
B	yeah well that's all they were doing isn't it?
A	I know but I don't I don't think that was fair
B	but it does hurt and it's not fair I I agree with you it does hurt and it it isn't fair but
A	mm
B	erm you know it is something that is hard to do when you're younger but you you can
A	yeah should probably go and get dressed now
B	I'm just wondering if it's worth it?
A	I don't think dad will be happy if she's not
B	W A L K yeah
A	is he is he coming back this evening?
B	no he won't be back till tomorrow afternoon
A	oh
B	if he was coming back this evening he'd be able to take me to my interview tomorrow
A	ah that's a good point isn't it?
B	mm
A	I didn't think about that
B	I haven't made the soup yet
A	no well maybe we should just leave it
B	she didn't go O U T yesterday
A	no
B	well it's a bit if ifwe take her for erm a W A L K don't wanna say the word we'll have to walk quite a while for her to get a decent walk
A	no
B	erm
A	you just said the word
B	I know I know I'm sorry it's
B	erm well we if take her down to the park we're gonna lose the ball
A	yeah
B	I feel mean now
A	so do I
B	look at her
A	well maybe I could start the soup or something
B	what and I go out on my own with the dog?
B	not happening
A	okay well then maybe the soup's going to be a bit late
B	the soup's going to be a bit late come on get your glad rags on
A	okay
B	you're not getting out of this
