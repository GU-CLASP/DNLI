C	mm
A	I don't suppose
A	well then there's plenty of time for that god willing
B	yeah god willing
A	something about god?
C	why?
B	well all the
A	me I could slag it off as good as the next man
B	mm
A	that's true I forgot to take your er what's its name thing
B	what's that?
A	what you wanted me to have a look at
B	oh yeah but I didn't take it back though
A	yeah I noticed in Wilkinson you can buy one what looks identical for a tenner
B	can you?
A	it's hardly worth
B	hardly worth it yeah
C	no
A	hardly worth worrying about
B	no
C	yeah that's a laminator is it? you're talking about?
A	yeah laminator that's the one yeah but they had sort of like I say they had them in Wilkinson's for a tenner
C	yeah
A	probably got them in Tesco's for a fiver
B	well this one don't switch on the drive and it don't pull through
A	yeah
B	and I think that's just seized right up
C	we won't bother then we'll just get another one
A	well you know it's like all these things it's probably some little glitch in the
B	yeah
A	in the electric
C	it's just the shame it's the first time we used it
B	yeah we hadn't used it before
A	mm
B	if we'd have
C	yeah
B	if that was like that when we tried at home but they might have just laid there for a year or two you see?
A	yeah
C	mm
B	and forgot how it work
A	well I mean all this stuff is so cheap innit?
B	mm
A	you know it's hardly surprising that there's a percentage of it don't work
B	that's right
C	I suppose so mm
A	I took a a good photo of the er eclipse
B	you got the eclipse did you?
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	oh
B	we saw just the end bit and there was a
C	how do you?
B	there was a a a little tiny tiny bit left weren't there by the time we the clouds cleared
A	mm well I I sort of er thought ah no you know not too interested in this and but then when you know cos they were building it up on the radio
B	yeah
A	I sort of went out and of course it was grey everywhere
B	yeah
A	and er there was sort of a bit of glow in the sky and I thought ah yeah it's rubbish I'll go indoors and then as I was sort of walking slowly indoors I suddenly looked up and the cloud had thinned and there it was
B	yeah
C	wow
A	and er the cloud was such that it formed a really good filter
B	brilliant yeah yeah
A	know what I mean?
B	yeah
A	so I then ran ran indoors and got the camera
C	mm
A	and er come out again and you could see where it was and it was sort of like
B	yeah
A	bit more cloudy bit less cloudy bit more
B	yeah
A	but there were sort of patches with it as well
B	yeah
A	sort of braced it and I was sort of clicking away
C	right
A	and er got some really good well a couple of really good photos
B	brilliant yeah
A	right at the maximum extent yeah where it was just a big smile in the sky
B	oh
C	oh nice
A	and it is really clear
B	yeah
A	although you know you were still photographing through cloud
B	yeah
A	cos there was one bit where it did actually clear you know much much thinner
B	yeah
A	and then it was so so bright then that you couldn't look at it you know
B	no
A	but this was just the right amount of filter
C	oh
A	brilliant
C	yeah
B	I watched it through my
B	mm yeah
A	to the EDP and stuff
B	that's it yeah
A	and all this and my photo was much clearer
B	was it?
A	much sharper than
B	yeah
A	any of them but they were sort of saying
C	you should have done it
A	yeah
B	no they don't pay you for it though do they?
A	no
C	no they don't
B	and they
A	it's all part of this idea that newspapers have nowadays that
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	they get people to write in and to send photos in
B	send us your photo of this crash and stuff like that you know
A	and that's right yeah and they don't pay them it's just for the benefit of you know the
C	mm
B	they sometimes put the name up
A	that's right yeah
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	but you don't get any money like
A	and er it's just like cheap production innit?
B	it is yeah
A	yeah
B	but all these freelance photographers must must have lost no end
A	mm you'd have to get something specialised wouldn't you?
B	yeah
A	without anyone with a
B	yeah with a phone and everything I mean a friend up up
A	mm
C	mm
B	just as good as any
A	yeah erm and what's that an Apple Apple six or something cos they got phenomenal resolution haven't they?
B	yeah yeah
A	have they?
B	yeah
C	how do you do that?
B	well that's what I mean that's a bit stupid innit?
A	that's right they always do these things where they get some gismo and they keep adding stuff to it till it becomes
B	yeah they do and then in the end you've got a have a great big bag to carry it
A	that's right yeah and then they'll go back to minimising it again
B	yeah
A	but the other the other
B	that's what I wanted to tell you
A	you know and there's all these people lining the streets and they say oh in a in a coffin made with English oak you know and all this sort of thing
B	what's going on? yeah
C	yeah
B	that's when I said to you
C	that's right yeah
A	yeah and er
B	I thought crikey
A	and then they had a shot of the the crowd and they were all there
C	mm
B	yeah
C	yeah and they're going to file past aren't they to see the the coffin?
A	that's right yeah
B	isn't that ridiculous yeah? I mean a bag of bones and they and they're going lairy about it I mean how do they know it's his?
C	did you think they put them all together?
A	I put I put the fault down to Diana
B	yeah
A	that's when it all well no I don't suppose it did all start then but
B	no it started with Churchill really doesn't it?
A	yeah but I mean at least there was some reason for it wasn't there? I mean a lot of people had a lot of
B	yeah yeah
C	mm
B	that's right cos what happened? er in nineteen fifty-three the queen was crowned wasn't she?
A	mm
B	and we all at school got a jamboree bag and we and
A	you got a bag? er
B	yeah a little like big as a crisp bag full of little bits and pieces that was the
A	oh we got a mug and a orange I think
B	we got and a bible
A	and a bible that's right yeah New Testament
B	mm
C	oh
A	don't know where mine is never opened it it's still in
B	still got mine
A	it'll be in pristine condition had the er gold lettering on the front didn't it?
B	that's right yeah
A	had your name in it as well I think
B	yeah
A	you got it for school didn't you?
B	yeah and when we left when I left secondary modern school
A	they wouldn't allow it nowadays
B	no they wouldn't would they?
B	I remember that when we had erm what they called assembly we had to go to assembly every morning didn't we and and there was all the prayers
A	you had the hymn book didn't you?
B	and you had the hymn book and everything and all that but there was some who never came into the assembly they were all exempt from assembly
A	they were sort of Jewish weren't they?
B	they were Jewish yeah
A	they weren't
B	they had their own didn't they?
A	mm
B	in fact where in
A	mm I tell you something it feels ages since I come round doesn't it?
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	in the mean time did you see in the EDP they had a little photo gallery or it might have been in the Evening News about forgers and and iron works and machine places in in
B	in
A	you know showing them about casting metal and stuff in various places
B	yeah
A	which are all now long gone even
B	yeah
A	and er but they had a picture of
B	did they?
A	in I forget where it was but I bet er it was sort of like in the sixties early sixties
B	yeah
A	and there was this sort of like you know if you recognise anyone in this photo get in touch
B	oh was it?
A	and I was I was going to send it to you but for some reason I didn't get round to it or give you the link you know
B	yeah
A	ha
B	oh might have seen someone might have known someone
A	yeah but it was quite interesting that in see I've got this argument about how Britain has been let down ever since the war by successive governments
B	yeah
A	in as much as you know people that are really industrious have worked hard but it never seemed to get as far forward as everyone else
B	no
A	like America or Germany or
B	that's right
A	people like that and er and it's not just the sort of national er identity or national way of life it's the you know the whole organisation has been so crappy in Britain
B	yeah
A	that you know people are working you know and everything's against them to get to do
B	it is isn't it? to do well
A	you know to achieve something
B	yeah
A	I mean it's changing a bit now
B	yeah
A	I think where people are more much more professional in in running in their business
B	yeah
A	you know the business is run much more professionally
B	yeah
A	but you know during that era all these businesses were run by sort of were sort of family businesses and they were sort of you know just run into the ground weren't they?
B	yeah yeah
A	and like the people who owned them used to take as much as they could out of it
B	they used to
A	they'd never replace machinery
B	no
A	never do any modernisation and stuff
B	no when my friend used to work down the the
A	yeah
B	their lathes and all their machinery were all Victorian
A	yeah they were yeah I've got a feeling that in this
B	yeah not when I went but there was some cos he started off in his garage where I where I spent my apprenticeship he started off in his garage S and G
A	mm
B	and they built up to what they were you know?
A	well this is what I really noticed that in these photos are these people working in these foundries and in engineering works and stuff like that they were all wearing you know like all their old clothes and stuff like that
B	yeah
A	and sort of like look really sort of you know wearing warn out clothes and old jackets and
B	yeah that's right yeah
A	all their old stuff and looking like a load of tramps off the street
B	they were yeah
A	and when I went to Germany you know in the sort of eighties ah well late seventies everyone who went to work anywhere used to work like overalls bib and brace stuff or you know they'd have a special overalls work gear you know?
C	mm
B	yeah
A	and it was all smart and every week they'd have clean it you know and come up
B	yeah
A	and you know and you could go in in all the shops I mean like places like Tesco's and that and they'd have a whole range of work gear you know so you could sort of kit yourself out in your your work gear they wouldn't dream of going to work in their own clothes
B	no but then
A	mm
B	and they I think it was ideal you used to come you used to pile your overall in and they used to come and wash them
B	and
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	that's right but I mean for a long time you know all these firms are just
B	oh they just they used people
A	it was just working inside someone's shed wasn't it?
B	yeah they did they used people
A	you know they just had these sort of places and
C	yeah
B	they used to say well if you can't do it we can get other people can
A	mm
B	and and at one time people who I think this was in the late thirties forties they used to stand outside the gates and they used to say we'll have you you you and you and call them in
A	that was a traditional sort of docker style wasn't it?
B	yeah yeah
A	round the docks that you'd turn up
B	that's right yeah
A	seven o'clock in the morning and then
B	and then they'd pick you
A	they'd pick you if you didn't get a job you had to go home again
B	yeah cor dear
A	and I think it's probably in field work as well a similar sort of thing
B	yeah yeah it was it was
A	all this sort of casual work
B	what a terrible thing though eh?
A	well you only have to watch that film I'm Alright Jack
B	oh yes
A	you know with Peter Sellers in it
B	that's right yeah
A	and to see what the state of play was
B	life was yeah yeah
A	in in manufacturing in this country
B	yeah oh it was terrible wannit?
A	it's hardly surprising the whole blooming industry in this country just went to the dogs innit?
B	well it did I mean they did they could have had a good industry in this country
A	course they could
B	it did get sold off and spoilt
A	yeah but it was only basically when Nissan came to this country
B	yeah
A	that they started having proper industrial relations with you know with the workforce
B	yeah yeah
A	cos before it was just us and them and er
B	that's right
A	you know nobody everyone was out for what they could get
B	yeah well where the er unions weren't recognised the bosses used to be able to just take or leave them you know if you'd you're you're getting this amount of pay and when I when I went to
A	mm mm what is it?
A	oh right
B	he can't get in can he?
C	yeah
A	no he's just chewing through the plastic
B	that's wire
A	mm tough luck the blue tit's going crazy over there probably got a nest
B	yeah
A	but even good firms like you know where people used to love working like
B	yeah
A	and and er
B	yeah
A	firms like that I mean people used to be really proud to work there
B	they did didn't they?
A	but they still weren't treated very well
B	no no they were supposed to get all this that and the other the first one to do it was Cadbury's wannit? when they they gave them a house to live in
C	yeah they did
B	as long as they worked for them
A	but that was tied wasn't it?
B	that was tied houses yeah
A	that was a bit like erm farmers cottages
B	that's right yeah and if you didn't work for them you lost your house
A	yeah that's right so you had to make
B	with all the furniture outside
A	mm but you had to make sure that you didn't fall out with the bosses didn't you?
B	that's right yeah
C	mm
A	I don't know there's so much wrong with this country I think the major problem is you know they talk about the housing crisis right? and er what they can do and what they can't do about how they give all this money away but the best thing they could do is to have a really strictly regulated letting system
B	yeah
C	mm
B	well there's
A	whereby there's fixed rents fixed conditions you know a bit like in you know in Germany
B	yeah that's right
A	like people don't bother about buying houses
B	they don't do they? no
A	cos you can rent so easily and you know you're getting a standard of of apartment whereas in this country renting is only for the poor people innit?
B	yeah yeah and and that's
A	yeah yeah and and the government must realise
C	you would think they'd checked out wouldn't you?
B	yeah
A	but the government must realise that it really restricts movement of er workers
B	it does
A	you know cos if you've you know got a house in
B	it would wouldn't it? yeah
A	to sell up and all the hassle and you know you got to wait months before you get the money and then you got to rent somewhere and then buy somewhere and what have you
B	yeah
A	and you know when you've got to rent somewhere you're talking about two or three thousand quid
B	yeah
A	to hand over and all these all these
B	and then when they come in and inspect they say oh there's a spot on the wall that will cost you a thousand quid where we've got to have a thousand pound to paint that
A	yeah yeah but the erm yeah and and at one time they said that agencies weren't allowed to charge you
B	mm
A	but they all charge you they're still charging they just call it something different don't they?
B	yeah
A	like registration or something or
B	that's it yeah
A	what have you
C	that's right
B	yeah registration fee
A	and it's not like a hundred quid it's sort of five or six hundred quid you know
B	yeah always have to pay a registration fee for something or other I mean that that
A	well they
B	inventory and stuff like that
A	well yeah and they have to do a sort of er erm credit check
B	oh yeah yeah
A	yeah and that they charge a hundred and fifty quid for that
B	yeah
A	I mean it costs ten quid
B	yeah yeah
A	it's absolutely
B	that's right yeah
A	you know
B	and apparently if you don't borrow money you can't get a credit
A	well apparently so yeah if you haven't got I haven't got a credit rating
B	I haven't got a credit rating
A	I've never never borrowed money
B	no
C	yes we have
B	well we just borrowed money
C	must have
B	well for the for the mortgage yeah
A	well
C	you do yeah and if you do Barclaycard and that it's erm
A	oh yeah but
B	yeah but we pay that off every month
A	then if you pay it off every month they don't register
C	it's still called a isn't it still called a credit rating? our credit rating is good cos we pay off
A	yeah but no if we pay it off
B	yeah that's only with
A	if you pay off every month like the whole amount
B	mm or generally
A	you don't get a bonus on your credit rating for that
B	no you don't
A	any time you get a bonus is if you got a constant debt of five thousand then you you pay the interest every month
C	oh right
B	yeah
A	regularly
C	okay
A	you know
B	the credit rating is done by by two different firms and er I forget what they're called but
A	Experian is one
B	Experian is one and there there is another one and that's where your credit rating come from
C	mm
B	it's nothing to do with Barclays or or Lloyds or any bank or anything like that that's if you owe money and you're paying it off you're getting a good credit rating
C	mm
B	but if you owe money and you don't pay it off that's where it where everything
A	or if you've got a county court judge you know you've had a er an argument with someone about what they owe and that but they it was on the radio the other day they don't take you know they don't have all the information
B	no
A	they just have some of it and then they make a guess on that but
B	yeah
A	mm if that guess was wrong
B	that's right you had it ain't you?
A	you had it
C	mm
B	yeah
A	you know it's all mighty number of hoops you have to jump through to get it put right
B	and there's also a a credit rating on your address
A	that's right if someone had lived there previously
B	yeah now we had somebody oh years and years ago some and er the credit and they wrote to us saying something about it didn't they?
C	yeah
B	I can't remember what is was
C	it was to here actually wasn't it?
B	to here yeah
C	no one else had lived here
C	they had a a name associated
B	and they had a name associated with our address
C	mm
B	so we phoned them up and wrote to them and all that and they oh there's been a terrible mistake
C	mm
B	but that's good innit?
A	mm
B	and they they writ it off you know they they
A	changed it
B	changed it all but somebody somewhere has given this address
A	yeah but it shouldn't be up to you to
B	no it shouldn't no
C	we'll just have to get in touch say
A	it's like blooming erm I'm still at loggerheads with the television licensing authority
B	are you? cos you ain't got one?
A	they sent another letter yesterday and each letter is getting more and more threatening you know?
B	yeah
A	and they say if you erm you know have any valid reason for not having please get in touch with us on like this number you know or on this website
C	mm
A	and I'm thinking no why should I get in touch with them?
B	yeah
A	come and do your darndest
B	yeah
A	cos you know I mean
B	come and take my television away
A	it's bloody cheeky isn't it? I reckon that you have to prove
C	yeah
A	I mean it doesn't happen with a gun licence or a fishing licence or a any other sort of licence
B	no no no you have to prove you haven't you a television well they got maybe you have
A	they just assume that you've got a television and you got to prove you haven't
C	yeah
C	cos it erm it's because it was on the standing charge
B	on a standing charge and he kept paying his television licence
C	he hasn't yet he got in touch with them he hadn't had a television for a long time
B	and now he can get all his money back
C	apparently yeah
A	can he get his money back?
B	yeah
C	yeah yeah that's what they've told him he hadn't got it yet
B	that's what they told him he hadn't got it yet
A	but how much? it must be a minimum amount of time
B	there must be
A	or a maximum amount of time
B	yeah oh er it isn't over a year anyway is it?
A	but I reckon the
B	and are they can they break in if you're?
A	no no no no no they can't come in at all they can only come in if you invite them in
B	yeah
A	if you stand on the doorstep and you don't have to answer any questions either
B	no
A	and er if they think you've got a telly they can go away and get a
B	yeah yeah
C	mm
A	and then they come back with the police right and then they can search your house and can check your your computer and all this sort of stuff
B	oh course you can watch watch telly on the computer can't you?
A	well you need a TV card don't you?
B	you do yeah
A	mostly so they can see if there's one of them stuck in the back
B	oh yeah course
A	and er although they do live streaming as well don't they?
B	yeah they do yeah
A	I'm not hundred percent sure that that counts because the the TV licence wording says that you're not allowed to watch anything on your computer which is
B	oh I see
A	and like the streaming isn't on the TV
B	no it isn't
A	this is the other thing I was thinking if I bought myself a a video pass for motor GP
B	yeah
A	which is streamed live you know without going through the television at all
B	yeah
A	and no one else can you can't see it on television you can only see it streamed
B	that's right yeah
A	you know whether that counts I don't know it's live so I don't bother there's nothing on I mean it
B	there isn't no
C	no
A	even if I miss something you know I I don't particular I'm not that interested in it
C	well no no
A	watching it later
B	no no we're not what what we do watch first thing in the morning is some of the bits that we've er recorded
C	yeah there was some good stuff this morning weren't there?
B	I can't remember what we watched this morning
C	erm The Food We Eat
B	oh The Food We Eat yeah
C	oh how blueberries are a a super food
B	all about super foods
A	oh right
C	and
B	and
B	and how they got this er getting rid of of what was it called? er getting rid of the the
C	antioxidants?
B	antioxidant the yeah
A	oxidants
B	the yeah and radical digerydoos
A	radicals
B	yeah radicals
A	toxic radicals
C	give you cancer and things yeah
B	that's it yeah and a very good to er get rid of any cancer type cells
A	mm
C	what did they have? they had broccoli
A	yeah broccoli is
[ANNOTATION]	toxic radicals are good for health	Contradiction
C	oh
A	is brilliant for
C	green tea
B	green tea yeah
C	what's that spice?
B	blueberries
C	that spice turmeric?
B	turmeric
C	and something else
B	and they got this tablet now that they've now formulated
[ANNOTATION]	the spice that C asked about is cinnamon	Entailment
A	mm
B	because all these different thing this is Cancer Research all these different thing attacks the cancer in a different way
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	B has majored in biology	Neutral
B	and they're all naturally naturally produced if I mean er in lots of countries where they've proven that they eat all this type of thing there's hardly any cancer
A	far fewer cancers mm
B	yeah
A	whereas in this country you've got one in two chance of catching getting cancer in your lifetime don't you?
B	well that's right yeah in your whole lifetime
A	yeah I mean that's pretty pretty short odds innit?
B	yeah that is
[ANNOTATION]	getting one in two chance of getting cancer in a whole lifetime is short odds	Neutral
C	isn't it?
B	anyhow that's that's they got this er tablet formulated but they said you needn't have the tablet all you need to do is eat the eat the food well that's that's what come out of it altogether
C	that was basically yeah
B	basically they say if you if you eat eat your
A	processed
B	processed stuff
C	I can't really remember what the blueberry
C	they did it on various different people didn't they?
[ANNOTATION]	blueberry causes cancer according to The Food We Eat	Contradiction
B	they did yeah and they all come out they were the best one was ninety percent better
A	mm mm
B	improvement and the worst one was sixty percent improvement
C	mm
A	that's until they find the next wonder food
B	well yeah yeah well that was just that experiment
C	yeah
B	well the things they did were always good
B	anyway
C	yes they are yeah
B	yeah yeah
A	cos I mean er as as I
B	well it's not just broccoli it's all green food
C	yeah
B	all green food have got these these er
A	whatever they are
B	radical
C	oh
A	this conversation's a bit like I've been listening to this series
C	oh yeah yeah
A	and that's on radio four extra and it was at quarter to
B	yeah
A	and then I mean this was in about thirty-four parts right and er I sort of picked up on one or two of them and they're so interesting they really are
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	and
B	yeah
A	well no no no a major idea because all the ideas sort of like this sort of things that don't quite work unless someone go away and thinks about it for five years and someone would come out and explain why that
B	yeah
A	actually didn't yeah that doesn't and er they were sort of talking about
B	yeah
A	and what happened and you know how how galaxies are made and how stars are made in galaxies and then what happens with stars you know when they sort of the life story of a star and why some stars do one thing and some stars do another thing and then what happens after that you know and what black holes are and how black holes occur
B	yeah
A	and then they were talking about dark matter and all these sort of things you've heard of but you've got no idea what they are
B	no that's right yeah
A	and the
B	did she yeah?
A	that you could listen to fifteen minutes of her talking and think oh that was so interesting
B	yeah yeah
A	and then you start telling someone about it and as soon as you try and describe it you've forgotten it
B	that's it yeah
A	you know what I mean?
C	yeah it's a shame
A	you knew you understood it for fifteen minutes
B	yeah yeah
C	but it's it's translating it again isn't it?
A	that's right yeah
B	they they have a programme with Dara O'Briain and that er
A	oh that mathematics thing
C	Brian Cox
B	yeah
C	yeah Star Gazing or something?
B	and when Star Gazing it was called that's right it's a programme one the television that that is called Star Gazing and they show you all the different constellations and everything where to look at how to find them and and you know what sort of gear you need to see the stuff really really good that it it's really interesting and er they just blind you with science
A	mm
B	because they know so much I mean but they do
A	mm
B	I mean that was all about
A	dark stars yeah
B	black dark stars
A	this is what they er a bit about the life and death of the star right there was a a basically a star is just helium right?
B	that's it yeah
A	and helium burns and forms hydrogen or some process goes through it
B	that's right yeah
A	so all you got in the universe basically is helium and hydrogen that's all you've got to start with
B	yeah
A	and then these stars keep going until all the helium is used up and then what happens is the hydrogen then stars reacting with something else
B	yeah
A	and using itself up and forming carbon and iron right? and then all of the all of this sort of cos this
B	that's right yeah
A	massive you know amount of matter in it
B	yeah
A	and but it starts receding and receding and receding and all this whatever hydrogen stuff and it's all converted into carbon and iron and stuff and then that gets blown off and then you end up with just a metal core
B	yeah yeah
A	right an iron core and that's a dark star right and then they were saying that some stars are so massive right? that this iron core is basically unstable right? and it collapses in on itself under its
B	yeah
A	and then it forms these
B	it's so dense
A	it forms these er er sort of nuclear nuclear sort of er well it's like an explosion right
B	yeah
A	and these things explode in this phenomenal supernova right?
B	yeah
A	and during that process all the other elements in the universe are formed like gold nickel copper
B	yeah
C	ah
A	cos like when you think about like any element is basically a nucleus with electrons going round it
B	yeah that's right yeah
A	and whatever you know and it depends on how many electrons it's got to what metal it is
B	yeah yeah
A	or what what substance is it right? well I suppose they're all metals to start with aren't they?
B	yeah
A	and er of course during the course of this massive nuclear reaction during this supernova like all these all this hydrogen is converted to all these other things or the or the iron is converted to all these other elements and then they just get sprayed out all over the universe
B	that's god sneezing
A	right?
A	and and they were saying that every bit of gold you know that you own like a gold ring was once part of a supernova
B	yeah oh wow yeah
A	you know billions of years ago somewhere in space
B	wow
A	makes you think doesn't it?
B	it does make you think yeah yeah course gold is the only metal
C	but they mine it out the ground don't they?
A	yeah but that's only cos it's come together on the planet you see see planets are different from stars
B	yeah
A	they're formed by there's all this dust flying around in nebula right where you hear about like the horse head nebula
B	that's right yeah
A	they do this thing you know they go on erm Hubble photographs or something like that
B	yeah that's brilliant isn't it?
A	fantastic photographs of these nebula and stuff
B	yeah
C	mm
A	and like that Milky Way is a nebula as well
B	yeah yeah
A	and it's basically just a load of infinitely small parts of dust and all sort of stuff just drifting around and it gets in this sort of gravitational field and slowly you get it coalescing right?
B	yeah
A	and as it coalesces it build up its centre of gravity more and more which means it drags other stuff into it and and eventually it becomes a planet you know with just made out of dust in space and the bigger it gets the more it starts pulling it in
B	yeah no they they were
A	I mean that's I mean you know I'm probably talking a load of bollocks but that is basically
B	yeah what it's all about
C	yeah
A	sort of like the
C	you remembered that quite well
A	the the idea of what happens you know
B	yeah yeah
A	and there's other forces involved as well obviously and then you see you get a black holes are basically you know if you if you get one atom of what helium or something like that you got a nucleus there
B	yeah
A	and then an electron
B	going round it
A	going round with that that much space between and what happens if that electron goes
B	crashing in yeah
A	into the nuclei? you get this incredibly dense
B	yeah
A	you know you you can sort of compress everything to an incredibly dense object that's got it's so dense and so small but it's got a huge gravitational force
B	yeah yeah
A	and of course it then sucks all this other stuff in because it's got such a high gravitational force
B	yeah
A	and it sort of all all the stuff collapses into this really really really dense centre which makes an even
B	that's right yeah
A	and it's sucking stuff in all the time and you know and becoming more and more powerful
B	that's right yeah but er when we when we were at school I mean I'm talking yonks ago now our science teacher was very good at that sort of thing and he actually there was a just this tiny about as big as your fingernail tiniest bit of material I don't know what it was to this very day I don't know what it was but he had all these bits of material and
A	mm
B	and he said which do you think is the heaviest?
A	mm
B	and you could see like a house brick right well that's heavy you know but it went down to this little tiny piece of stuff and you couldn't lift it with two fingers you you know you'd have to have something to get underneath it and and lift it up god knows what it was but er ah he was a brilliant science teacher mind you he did he did blow up the he he did blow up the the classroom but he was he was really good Mr
A	the thing is though is that the amazing thing is is that when we went to school and learnt about things like that people didn't know nothing
B	no we knew nothing no
A	they didn't know nothing the teachers you know even the highest trained teachers didn't know anything
B	well yeah
A	and they'd teach you stuff and of course it wasn't till like Fred Hoyle came in and started
B	that's right yeah
A	working out all these in like in the sort of seventies and stuff sixties seventies
B	yeah
A	and then people since then you know like I mean the the knowledge curve has sort of gone
B	well it has hasn't it? yeah
A	you know like gradual and then suddenly shot up like
B	yeah
A	with these new of course with the space telescopes and things
B	they're fantastic
A	you know and these new telescopes they got these
B	yeah they can see right out of that's fantastic innit? er but what they did on this programme was they've got infrared telescope ultraviolet telescope and a and another type of telescope and you see all these things in different how they are then they blended them together and that was fantastic cos the the stuff that they you could see was fantastic and this is a star multimillion mile light years away
A	yeah that's right
B	but because they've got all this this this different er ways of looking
A	well that's a lot of these things you can only see on on ultraviolet or infrared or whatever
B	yeah yeah
A	you can't see them on ordinary
B	no no you can't no
A	and it's the same with the radio telescopes I mean they're
B	that's right
A	they set them up in a massive array don't they?
B	yeah they do yeah
A	and like it's not just one building it's like they're dotted in a sort of like ten kilometre circle
B	that's right
A	and they're each going up and getting radio waves and then combining it
B	but that they got them in Chile in
A	mm
B	loads and loads I don't know how many but loads of all these different all all following the same
A	yeah
B	track and looking at the same thing
A	they're not
B	and they're not looking at a supernova that is due to happen at any time
A	yeah
B	and then they're hoping to catch the actual supernova which will cos they're no change in colour the whole lot is just well light years away but
A	yeah yeah
B	they found it
C	yeah
A	but it's you know but like I say this is so interesting but like I say it's difficult to keep it in your head
B	that is difficult to keep in your head
A	it's so
C	yeah
B	especially at our age
A	well it's so so erm
C	no for anyone I reckon
B	well I don't know
A	yeah cos it's so mind boggling
C	otherwise you'd be an expert wouldn't you? in the beginning
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	I mean it's so mind boggling really
C	that is isn't it?
A	you know cos they you know the thing is you think oh I understand that I think I and then they say and that's forty million light years away
B	yeah what?
A	you start thinking about that and you think ah I've forgotten already
B	yeah
A	if it's something in your hand you can understand it but when they talk about light years
B	that's right
A	and billions of light years
B	and when you think of what space is what is it?
A	yeah
B	is there any beginning or any end?
A	no this is it
B	there can't be can it?
A	the big the big question innit? what was there before the big bang?
C	mm
B	well something was there before the big bang had to be
A	well not necessarily cos they reckon
B	yeah but they were
A	in in the big bang you created a load of positive mass and a load of negative mass right?
B	yeah but there had to be some whole
A	and if you put them together there'd be nothing left right it's it's like if if you if you dug a hole in the garden you created say that's the big bang you created all the earth you've taken out in the hole
B	yeah
A	right so you think well
B	no that's right but the
B	when you when you talk about nothing
C	mm
B	er there's nothing it's it's too hard to contemplate there's there's
A	yeah
B	got to be something to bring the nothings together there's got to be something
A	well that's right I mean it's sort of like it's more difficult to er comprehend than is there a god?
B	well yeah
A	well no it's easier to comprehend than is there a god cos
B	well that's just a belief
C	I don't know it's all connected isn't it?
A	it's
C	it really is all connected
B	yeah it's all connected
A	cos they cos they want something to be in charge
C	mm
B	they want some
A	and some reason
B	somebody must have made it you see
A	mm
B	but when that come to somebody must have made that who made the somebody who made it?
A	right that's right I mean this is the question what what was before the big bang and where did god come from?
B	yeah yeah
A	who created god?
B	yeah
A	cos he couldn't have always been there but that's the answer you get innit?
B	yeah yeah I mean when you when you think of it and go really deep into it that's just impossible to really understand innit?
C	yeah
A	well
B	well for the likes of everybody they're just all they're all they're coming up with is theory theory theory theory nobody
A	well no cos they do prove it occasionally don't they?
B	yeah they prove but they can't prove at what really really happened what happened before the big bang and all that
A	no
B	there's no proof there
A	yeah but they're they're getting
C	where did the stars come from before they?
A	they're work
B	yeah
A	they're working down to it aren't they?
B	yeah
A	that's what they're working towards
B	they're very clever people
A	they are
B	very clever people I mean they
A	they you see they but like I say they spend like a lifetime
B	doing it yeah
A	working on one little aspect
B	working it out yeah
A	and they know everything about it and they've worked it all out in their head and they sort of
B	that's right
A	I mean it would be a real bugger if someone came along and said oh sorry I've just proved you wrong
A	oh my lifetime's work
A	which must happen
B	that's gotta happen well it did happen once or twice didn't it? I mean
A	yeah
B	that's somebody tried to
A	well I don't think they tried to prove it wrong but they sort of like
B	well they didn't prove it
A	it opens up a lot of erm possibilities which aren't catered for in the theories
B	in the theory yeah
A	and then they try and fit these you know
B	things altogether
A	you know other fit it altogether and then suddenly find see this is how you progress in astronomy and nuclear physics or anything or
B	well yes
A	anything like that is that something'll be accepted and it'll be accepted for several years you know?
B	yeah
C	mm
A	and all the time there's people beavering away trying to prove
C	yeah
A	connected to it how they're trying to fit it in
C	that's right yeah
A	and then they
B	yeah
A	which sorted out a lot of stuff and er his theories were accepted for ages but there was something he says well someone worked out how much carbon there was in the in the er galaxy
B	yeah
A	and er god knows how
A	and er then this the amount of carbon was much too much to be associated
B	with
A	with the original ideas Fred Hoyle's ideas right?
B	yeah yeah
A	and so he this guy you know he sort of like bugged him and he was sort of working on this for about god knows how many years
B	years yeah
A	and then he came up with this supernova idea which then explained which agreed with Fred Hoyle
B	yeah
A	up to a point but said that okay this his happens but if it's too big then it creates supernova and this is what creates all the carbon
B	yeah
A	you see?
[ANNOTATION]	carbon is made in supernovas	Entailment
B	oh I see yeah yeah
A	cos it cos you know no one could have an idea that you know sorts out everything
B	no no that's true
A	you know you can only sort out one little bit and er
C	yeah
A	it's like the light theory isn't it?
B	that's right yeah
A	about whether it's a wave or a or a pulse
B	that's right yeah
A	and er then they come up to say it's a pulse working in a wave
B	yeah
A	but you know someone come up and sort that out eventually if they haven't already done so
B	well they will yeah yeah but the nice thing about all this science stuff and and they there are scientists from all over the world working together on things aren't they?
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a is a physics teacher	Neutral
A	yeah
B	I mean they're all collaborating
A	yeah course they are
B	and they never used to did they?
B	it used to be
A	well I suppose there's
B	a pocket of scientists
A	it's so expensive now that they have to sort of like utilise what they can
B	they have to collaborate yeah yeah that's fantastic I mean the Russian scientists and the American scientists working together
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b is russian	Neutral
A	sometimes
B	well lots of the time you know I mean
A	yeah
B	but it's only the politicians that are not working together
A	yeah
B	and that's awful when politics come into it that's that becomes stupid
C	mm
B	what are you looking at your foot for?
A	what?
B	what are you looking at your foot for?
A	dunno I just
A	yeah
B	yeah it's a funny old funny old world but there you go it's all about me so
[ANNOTATION]	politicians from all over the world collaborate often	Contradiction
A	yeah yeah yeah don't need to don't need to
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a looked down at their foot	Entailment
B	I'm just trundling along in my little way
A	don't need to affect us at all does it?
B	no
C	mm
B	as long as we can go from A to B and work out bits and pieces how to get there
A	er
C	oh
B	it don't matter what we all finish up in the same place we'll all be dug up and treated as kings one day
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b is more interested in the way than the goal	Contradiction
A	not if you're burnt to cinders
C	not if you're burnt up and there's nothing left of you
A	burnt up burnt up and ground
B	oh yeah well they you know these Vikings they they can't find any Vikings can they cos they were all burnt up weren't they?
A	I don't know
B	they were burnt up on their
A	couldn't have been that many couldn't have that many ships go round could they?
B	no
C	no
B	no
C	that's a bit daft really
A	they do find Viking graveyards
B	yeah well they they've found some in
B	no
A	what and they found a Viking graveyard?
C	there was a programme just yesterday on Stonehenge
A	I watched some of that
B	oh yes
A	that was interesting wannit?
C	did you? that was a load of rubbish wasn't it?
A	was it why?
C	well they got all these ancient men
A	well these these international
C	stone age men
A	these international archaeologists had been
B	oh yeah yeah
A	doing a combined
C	oh yeah some bits but I mean then they started looking at bones didn't they? skeletons and
A	oh like the
B	yeah they did yeah
C	and in in the burrows
A	but the recreationist bits
B	yeah
A	but that that yeah I mean you got to take that with a pinch of salt that's just to make it a bit more interesting
C	they put some well they put some stupid bits in it which spoilt it
B	for the layman
A	for the layman
B	yeah
A	but it was interesting when they that massive great trench they'd dug
B	that's right yes yes
A	and then they sort of worked out you know the two pits at either end
B	yeah
A	and it matched up exactly with Stonehenge
B	that did yeah
A	like before Stonehenge was built
B	yeah yeah
A	it was like four hundred years before Stonehenge was built wasn't it?
B	yeah that was the the them aerial they could tell from these aerial photos and then there's a big old er sauna thing not sauna
A	sauna?
B	not sauna what do you call that?
A	sun?
B	no where where they
A	what the bit of kit you're talking about
B	yeah what did they call it?
A	I dunno unless it's
C	well we actually gave up on it didn't we?
B	we did give up on it yeah
A	I did and watched the painting class
B	so did we
C	we did
A	do you watch that?
A	cos that's quite interesting but I mean right at the beginning you could tell who who's the good ones and
C	we just turned over
B	yeah you can can't you? yeah
C	yeah
A	yeah and like they none of them are that good are they?
B	no I don't think they were that good at all no
C	no
A	if you think they were supposed to have picked out you know the best amateur artist or something
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	and you think well you know
B	yeah
A	and they you know they were okay
B	they were okay yeah but er
A	like it's sort of like
B	the pictures they
A	no I I never seen the beginning of it so
B	don't you? no
C	yeah
A	no but the er I mean they're sort of quite clever aren't they? or they're all pretty clever but
C	oh yeah
B	they're all quite clever yeah
A	and
C	it's the timing isn't it? that's
B	the old girl had to leave yesterday didn't she?
A	yeah but she had a technique she used and she never changed right through the programme did she?
B	she never changed did she? no
A	she always did it in the same sort of like you know sort of calypso type
B	that's it yeah
A	thing you know with all the colours and stuff and
B	I like that young girl
A	which one?
B	the young girl with the long hair
A	yeah well
B	she's she's different
A	her and the other the really short one
B	yeah
A	they're the only two I reckon who have got natural talent
B	that's it yeah yeah
C	mm
A	they got natural talent but lacking in technique
B	that's right yeah
A	whereas the balding bloke is
B	he's got the technique
A	is he ex-army?
B	yeah
A	I mean he could make a living doing
B	course he could
A	Norfolk coast paintings
B	yeah
A	you know working to the same formula
B	all the time yeah
A	flashing them out cos he's quite he's got quite a good technique and he knows what he's doing and stuff like that
B	yeah
A	but you're he seems to be lacking in any sort of er
B	ideas really and you know
A	any sort of freedom of expression
B	yeah yeah
A	which could be cos he's out of the army
B	well that's right he he's too
A	and the and the other bloke the er Glaswegian guy
B	oh yeah
A	is he Glaswegian?
B	well he's Scottish anyway
A	yeah I reckon that he's
B	yeah I know what you mean yeah
A	he's got a natural talent but he doesn't believe in learning a technique or doing anything he's just like determined to I'll do it my way
B	no yeah
A	no matter how crap it is
B	yeah yeah
B	yeah
A	and you know for every one good one he has he has like one rubbish one
B	that's right that's like that young girl when she wouldn't change and then all of a sudden she changed didn't she?
A	yeah
B	and she listened to what they were talking about and listened to what they said and she decided suddenly to do something totally different to what she
A	yeah
B	usually did and they all liked that they really liked that
A	and she hasn't she hasn't the one with the frizzy hair hasn't actually had any disasters really
B	no she hasn't she's been good hasn't she?
B	yeah
A	none of them really bad
B	no
A	and some of them quite good I think if I bought a painting off any of them I'd buy one of hers
B	yeah
A	you know cos she
B	yeah she's good
C	I like the way she uses colour
B	yeah and also she's got sort of impressionistic
A	she has hasn't she? yeah
B	very impressionistic
A	yeah
C	mm
B	yeah
A	but it's quite interesting the programme cos the
C	mm
A	the woman artist the the the one who judges
B	yeah
A	she comes out with some really good
B	she does yeah
A	sort of
B	yeah but what I would really like to see about the whole programme is I mean the
A	yeah
B	what to do I'd like her to do it as well but she doesn't do it does she?
A	yeah well I think
C	no
A	not not commercial not that much erm into it
B	no
A	I think she's more true you know what I mean?
B	yeah I know what you mean yeah
A	like he's a bit of a sort of a he strikes me as being a bit of a sort of a
B	I didn't like the stuff he did yesterday though
A	I didn't see it I only saw the last one and a half bits
B	oh did you? yeah
A	but what I like about that programme is what's that woman's name who the celebrity?
B	oh aye she's good isn't she yeah? she used to be in
A	is she?
C	she's funny
B	she's erm
A	is she good? she drives me bloody mad
B	she does doesn't she? yeah
A	she I'd like to see her you know
C	er
A	tipped over the edge
B	she's such a she's such a drip ain't she?
A	she is
C	and the way she dresses as well it's really
A	yeah
B	yeah yeah
A	and she sort of
B	you're not going to you're not going to destroy it are you? don't don't start again
A	so oh don't start yeah and I sort of think you know she's offering nothing to the programme
C	yeah
B	she used to be in erm Worzel Gummidge years ago
C	yeah Aunt Sally wasn't she?
A	did she?
B	she was Aunt Sally in Worzel Gummidge
A	oh really
B	and
C	did you not watch Worzel Gummidge?
A	no no I've never seen Worzel Gummidge
C	ha one of my favourite programmes
B	well they do you know they destroyed every every single?
A	did they?
C	oh it was so good
B	and the BBC had a row with Jon Pertwee
A	they were probably erm
B	yeah yeah
C	I can't remember her name now though
B	ah
A	she was in some other
C	Una Stubbs
[ANNOTATION]	Worzel Gummidge is good	Entailment
B	yeah that is Una Stubbs
A	is it? but she was in some other thing wasn't she? some famous
C	that's right yeah
A	er erm
B	she was in
C	yeah
A	soap type of thing
[ANNOTATION]	Uni Stubbs is dead	Neutral
B	she was in that er Alf Garnett one
C	that's it
A	was she in Alf Garnett?
B	yeah
C	that's what I thought you said what did you say?
[ANNOTATION]	Worzel Gummidge is a bad show	Contradiction
A	no I just said she was in
B	I said Una Stubbs
C	yeah I know
B	oh
C	erm
B	she was in Alf Garnett she was she was with that
A	oh that's right yeah the lefty
B	the lefty bloke
C	the
B	well that was a terrible racist thing
A	I thought that was a horrible programme
[ANNOTATION]	Alf Garnett is a horrible programme	Neutral
C	I can't remember what it was called I thought he
A	it was supposed to be like
B	well that was awful wasn't it?
B	you call your next door neighbour a coon
A	yeah
B	bloody coon oh that's terrible
C	terrible wannit?
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker C remember the name	Contradiction
A	that's right I mean it was it was all supposed to be you know like I say you know
B	how people talk
C	no
B	he was that was just awful
C	it was horrible wasn't he?
B	yeah
A	but people used to love it didn't they?
B	they did yeah
[ANNOTATION]	all people used hated it	Contradiction
A	cos they didn't realise that it was
B	Till Death Do Us Part
C	that's it
A	yeah
C	ah good
B	yeah that just come poof things things do though they leave your head for ages and then come back again when
B	one day when you're not thinking about it
A	they couldn't show it now could they?
B	no they'd never be able to show that now would they? oh that was so racist
A	and someone gets castigated for calling someone coloured instead of calling them black
B	yeah yeah
A	like you think it's the worst thing you could ever call anyone I didn't even know that coloured wasn't
B	no I didn't
A	but you had to call people black even if they're only brown
B	yeah
C	mm
B	why?
A	I don't know
B	I prefer the coloured one I mean
A	what's his name?
B	oh yeah
A	got into
B	he got
A	awful trouble didn't he for
B	yeah for calling them coloured
A	talking about his coloured friends or something?
B	who who decided that it's wrong?
A	I don't know
B	some idiot wants P
A	cos at one time you couldn't call people black could you?
B	no you couldn't
A	until you then had that sort of like it then became acceptable didn't it?
B	yeah I
A	no
B	he's not black you can't call a Chinese bloke black he's coloured
A	yeah but I suppose I don't know about this
C	if you know where they come from you're fine aren't you? no problem then
A	see if it's a the trouble is is that the trouble is is that a
B	it's alright if you call them Chinese
C	well I mean there was a there was a black bloke on there the other day he he used to be in well he's been in loads and loads of of programmes with that Richard Beckinsale can you remember him?
C	he was in that one
A	Death in Paradise isn't he?
C	yeah and he's in Death in Paradise yeah
B	and he was saying so what if they call me coloured
A	mm
B	what cos he he talked rather with a a posh accent doesn't he?
A	that's right he's got a very posh accent
B	he really he's really he is really good really posh
A	mm
B	and he he said I I don't see the problem
A	mm
B	I mean okay but he's saying
A	I am black but trouble is you see is that it's not him it's like if you go around somebody a black person or a group of or a type of person like say from some of the American states
B	yeah well that's the way it work
A	might take coloured as a as a really derogatory term you see?
B	yes yeah
A	and it's like if you in the er if you're in the southern states you can't call anyone boy can you?
[ANNOTATION]	1/3 of the Americans are black people.	Neutral
B	no
A	you know like here you say you alright boy?
B	yeah that's it yeah well it's
A	right you do that in America you'd get shot
B	that's yeah
A	you know cos it's the er
B	yeah
A	the
B	boys yeah
C	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	People don't shoot other people in America.	Contradiction
A	no matter who they were they were just boy
B	and that's what some of these erm sheriffs in the southern states still call them
A	still do yeah that's right yeah
B	they still call them you know this this
A	it's like a sign of like real negativity
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	and looking down on them
B	yeah
A	and but I mean it's like a minefield isn't it?
B	it is you don't know where you stand nowadays to be honest with you do you?
A	yeah
B	it's best just to keep out of the whole lot
[ANNOTATION]	Not all American states have sheriffs.	Neutral
A	but even then you see if you call a Welshman Taffy do they take offence at that?
B	well that's right
A	or you know
B	I expect so
[ANNOTATION]	Taffy is a racist word.	Neutral
A	or a Scot you know you
B	yeah
A	there's all sorts of terms
B	Jock innit?
A	Jock is Scot Paddy is is Irish innit?
C	mm
A	mm
B	Taffy is
A	but I mean in Scotland right they call English Sassenach right?
[ANNOTATION]	People in England don't use the word Sassenach.	Contradiction
B	that's right
A	and I only learnt a little while ago that Sassenach is the Celtic word for Anglo-Saxon
B	is it? I didn't know that
A	it's not a derogatory term it's just like a descriptive term
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	like for Anglo-
[ANNOTATION]	The word Sassenach first appeared in the medieval time.	Neutral
C	mm
A	and that's where the term come from
C	oh right
A	it's old English or something or or Celtic or
B	yeah I didn't know that
A	but Anglo-Saxon
A	but you know they use that as a derogatory term
B	they do they do yeah only some do though not all of them are
A	well it's like
B	it's like everything else innit? I mean you get the get the UKIP party and
A	oh cor blimey
[ANNOTATION]	The term is not a Spanish one.	Entailment
A	there's a there ain't a day go past without some
B	something terrible happening in the UKIP party
A	some something racist or stealing money or
B	oh god what is the matter with them all eh?
A	well it's cos they attract a party like that just attract every bigot under the sun
[ANNOTATION]	UKIP parties are quiet.	Contradiction
B	they do
A	every
B	yeah
A	and it had cost nine hundred and sixty quid and she had billed them for three and a half thousand
C	oh
A	and for a start and she said oh well it's liberating money from Brussels
A	this is UKIP
B	UKIP right yeah yeah
A	I'm thinking how the hell do you have a meal in a café for nine hundred and sixty quid in the first place?
B	that's right
C	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	The party wasn't overcharged.	Contradiction
B	yeah
C	whatever was it?
B	what are you treating the whole village?
A	I mean I mean it
B	it must have been a lot of people
C	yeah
B	it's my shout don't worry
[ANNOTATION]	There weren't many people in the treat.	Contradiction
A	yeah have what you want
B	have what you want the government will pay
A	I'll have a packet of fags and
C	at least a hundred people
B	yeah
B	bottle of whisky
A	bottle of whisky to take away and
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	The government would pay for up to 100 people.	Neutral
A	it just goes to prove it was done with such I mean this thing was done with such
B	well not a care in the
A	without a care they they'd obviously been doing it all the time
B	all the time and that just come natural to them
A	yeah that's right yeah and it's the same I mean we used to have a UKIP no he weren't here he sort of Broadland north north of Broadland
B	oh yeah
A	UKIP MEP
B	that's right yeah there was yeah
[ANNOTATION]	The government is really concerned of UKIP.	Entailment
A	there was some Asian guy and he'd been claiming something like thirty thousand a year
B	yeah
A	for his offices
B	yeah
A	office expenditure and it was a shed in someone's garden
C	oh
A	and he was claiming thirty grand a year office running expenses and all this sort of stuff
B	oh great oh dear
A	and this is about ten years ago and
C	yeah
B	oh there's there's a
A	he got they got the
B	Asian UKIP one on at the moment going through the mill I don't know that was on on the local news come from Kings Lynn area somewhere cos they reckon half of
A	well I hope so that's at least they won't be voting conservative
B	that's true
A	but the er yeah but I mean I mean it's like
B	well it must do mustn't it?
A	you know I mean they talk about all these open borders and stuff like that
B	yeah
A	like every crook in the in the world
B	want to come here
A	wanna come here cos it's such a blooming soft touch
B	yeah
A	it's so easy to fiddle everything
B	yeah
A	or it seems that way
B	it seems that except if you're British
A	and they do try to fiddle some
B	yeah if you're British that's it you you can't you can't get away with anything but you can come over from the Eastern Bloc and do almost what you like
A	yeah well it's they got the you know the the thing is that a lot of these countries this is what I'm talking about like erm seeing like Pakistan India Bangladesh you know lower systems have been run on graft and backhanders
B	yeah
A	for thousands of years you know like that's the way they work same as in Nigeria
B	yeah
A	you know they talk about corrupt Nigerians but that is how they work
B	that's how it is yeah
A	and once you understand what's happening you can live with it but
B	oh yeah
A	but you see when they come over here to Britain
B	and
A	well they
B	that's right yeah no
A	I mean you get
B	that's really weird innit? when you have these
A	these West London or East London boroughs like Tower Hamlets and
B	yeah
A	and places like that which are now run you know by the sort of Pakistani erm er you know what do you call it diaspora
A	and er they're forever sort of like you know people finding out about some really dodgy deals going on all over the places
B	yeah
A	you know where they you know employ the brothers and the cousins and that for
B	yeah that's it yeah
A	on these massive great contracts and then the money just evaporates and no one knows any more about it
B	no no that's right
A	I was reading Private Eye this week there was some
B	yeah
A	you know where they run workshops for business you know for start-ups and things like this and er after something like eighteen months this thing was closed down cos they didn't have any money and they ran an audit on it and there was something like eight hundred thousand pound no trace of just disappeared into into fresh air
B	oh
A	you know there's no there's no audit for it or anything you know there's no
B	yeah
A	and it was just like gone you know?
B	yeah
A	and you think like I mean even
B	yeah
A	you know just do
B	that's it yeah yeah
A	people are going to have their hand in the till no matter what aren't they?
B	well of course they are yeah
A	you know I mean you read about you know play schools parish councils church hall committees
A	they're forever you know finding out that someone's been ripping them off
B	yeah yeah
A	you know
B	yeah they do the treasurer running away with
A	mm
B	he put in thirteen tills and he was supposed to have twelve
A	oh right
C	mm
B	right? and everything went through the thirteenth till was his
A	oh really? oh that's a good scam really I mean
C	it was wasn't it?
B	that was that was
A	it was impossible to find out
C	no one even noticed
B	yeah until he left he left the whole he he ran away with around about thirty thousand pound
A	yeah
B	and this is a long while ago he ran off with thirty thousand pound and then they found out
A	that was he was a fool cos he should have had the till taken out
B	he should have done yeah
A	you know sort of went up you know waving a bit of paper saying I just had an order to dismantle that till
B	that till yeah yeah that's it yeah
A	you know and no one would have questioned him would they?
B	no
C	mm
B	but what a good idea
A	yeah I
B	well no doubt
A	I bet he didn't think it up himself did he?
B	no no no that's right
A	mm
B	but he got away with it
A	but I mean it's like that guy
B	I don't know
A	and there was a plot of land there
B	oh I heard yeah
A	and he ran it as a car park
B	that's it yet
A	and everyone assumed it was a council car park and he was running it
A	and he was there for lots of years wasn't he?
B	yeah he was
A	making a living off this car park and then somebody someone decided to ask a question about all all whatever it is or he gave up the ghost and
B	that's it yeah
A	and er they suddenly discovered that it was just cash in his hand
C	mm
A	no one knew who the land belonged to
B	no no
C	mm
B	oh dear well some people have got their head screwed on the right way round haven't they?
A	yeah yeah right but this is er a you know it's like everyone thinks differently don't they?
B	yeah
A	the way their mind works
B	yeah
A	and some people can just you know just see a scam like that and just go for it they don't have no
B	no no conscience at all innit?
A	no conscience either way you know they think well if I don't do it someone else will
B	yeah but I couldn't do it to be honest with you
A	well no you'd be worried all the time wouldn't you?
B	yeah it's the phone ring and you'd be ah and a knock on the door and you'd be ah cos cos we got consciences you see
A	yeah well that's right yeah
B	and that's the difference
A	mm
B	and and there are people that
A	yeah but I mean it's like the people who like nick a bit of land didn't they?
B	yeah
A	and sort of slowly creeping in a bit of land you know like
B	yeah yeah
A	you know they don't consider that any
B	they don't think no no
A	we go have a walk round then

A	mm mm
C	they took him off the tablets completely and he's been feeling fine
B	he's been brilliant ever since
A	mm
C	so he's been
A	well you see the tablets they could be
B	yeah
A	which may have pushed his blood pressure down so low that he felt dizzy
B	down low that's right yeah
A	you know?
C	yeah but I mean
A	you don't know yeah
C	he wouldn't have known you know

B	yeah
A	you know?
C	mm
B	and if the readings are okay
A	if the readings are high I'll say I'll just say oh it's cos I had an infection

B	it's a wonder it's stood up this long I I ran into that with a tractor and it pushed the wall out
C	yeah
B	the clutch went just as I was coming out the door and boom right into the wall
A	you could always build a a er timber sort of A-frame on the end to hold it up
B	could do
A	I've got to the stage now where
C	yeah we need to finish it
A	I got to the stage now
C	we need to finish it off
A	what the shed?
C	well yeah the
A	what's the
C	no the the block work and that we need to
A	oh the block work
C	do something look make it look right

A	yeah but it's settled now
B	yeah
A	you push it now you'll loosen it all up
B	you will yeah
A	yeah can't do that
B	yeah yeah
A	what you need to do is build an extension this side of it which'll hold it up
B	that's right
C	what a porch?
A	a porch yeah
A	if you sort of extended your workshop round
B	yeah
A	and incorporated a double doors
B	that's true
C	mm
B	that need pointing up really doesn't it as well?
C	mm we got lots of work to do
A	needs pointing up dear blimey if you saw the end of my the gable end of my house that's needed replastering for twenty years and every year I think I'll get someone to give me a quote for it and then I can't be bothered
C	no
A	like today I looked on the
C	yeah
A	yeah and they said enter a competition to win twenty thousand pound of home improvements so
C	have they got an offer have they?
B	oh wow so you've entered have you?
C	yeah
A	so I've well not quite but I will do
C	oh yeah
B	there's that big tree look
A	oh I see oh well
C	yeah
A	well the roots on that will see the end of your garage
C	will it? why?
A	well they have horrendous roots don't they?
B	they do yeah
C	are they? they weren't they weren't
A	well that don't matter
C	they're not that bad are they?
B	they always grow
A	I don't know they
B	they always grow them up against the south wall though
A	but they say what you should do is you should get something like a a barrel
C	right
A	and cut it
C	yeah
A	and plant them inside that to stop the roots expanding
B	oh I see
C	oh
A	otherwise they get massive you see that's the trouble with it
C	well we can still dig it up can't we now?
B	yeah that's that's only young
A	yeah yeah
C	it's only just gone in
A	yeah but it'll be alright for
B	stick it in that look
A	well no we need something with a bottom
C	no that's a bit small
A	but no they say that's what they say you know you sort of
C	do they? cos I I did read that they do well in pots
A	if you read about it if you cut the bottom out of a barrel
B	mm and bury the barrel
A	and set them down bury the barrel
B	yeah
A	and then plant them in that
C	mm
B	yeah
A	and then er stop the stop it getting too big that's basically it cos
B	yeah
A	figs are just get massive
C	right
A	whereas you only need it sort of like
C	and they fruit better probably won't they?
A	probably yeah
C	restricted
B	yeah but I mean that's going to see me out anyway so it don't matter
A	but that thing is is that the blackbird 'll eat them all any way
C	yeah but we get more if the fruit if it fruits better
B	that's
C	yeah
B	weird innit?
A	yeah they do yeah not on
B	no
A	ornamental
C	no
B	no
A	so you think how the hell do they sort of?

B	yeah
A	and then I said oh five quid oh that'll be alright and then I saw they were one pound fifty later on
