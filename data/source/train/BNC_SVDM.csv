B	so is this what am I allowed to talk about this recording whilst it's on?
A	yeah
B	is it is it being analysed by a computer sort of or by a person going through it?
A	I don't know probably people
B	oh
A	might be people I don't know
B	fair enough okay so I'll explain my trip
A	to Thailand
B	to Thailand I suppose
B	erm so erm took the bus to Gatwick I think the airport
A	did your mum not drive you?
B	no she doesn't drive
A	why?
B	anyway erm it's just not the trains aren't working
A	why don't you just get the train together?
B	erm well I think it was Heathrow and you can't get a train to Heathrow
A	oh Heathrow how long did it take you to get to Heathrow?
B	erm
A	by bus
B	no it's like
A	how much did the bus cost?
B	it cost about the same and then we went up erm
A	oh
B	and then I had a seven hour flight to
B	and that was that was really good because it was really I never went
A	is that where you were staying?
B	no no no we just stopped over there and it was like it was unimaginable it made Turkey look cool it was just it was like it was like a desert with houses in it and stuff
A	erm
B	I think in
A	so how do you get around?
B	well like stay inside in the hot hours of the day and if you need to get anywhere you have to get a taxi
A	fridge
B	no yeah lack of air conditioning in these countries is not good
A	yeah
B	erm anyways we stayed there for like an hour turnover and then got back on our eight hour flight to Thailand so by this point for the sake of
A	so what will you do at the airport?
B	well it is just an hour change over
A	so just eat
B	so I just ate a burger and got back on the plane
A	was it better than the flight to America?
B	erm yeah
A	was it a patch flight?
B	it was it was an evening flight to America
A	and it was only seven hours?
B	it was kind of no I think it was fourteen hours
A	oh I see but at least you had a stop over
B	erm yeah but it's almost like it's almost nicer to get it all out of the way at once like when we flew to America I don't know it was a bit half and half but erm anyway so we arrived in Thailand in the evening time
A	yeah
B	having left
B	like how on earth do we get from the airport to where we were meant to be staying
C	well did you not work that out before?
B	erm no obviously not
C	how much of it had you planned?
B	what?
C	but you did book a hotel?
B	we had a conversation about the
A	yeah
B	because obviously it's a bit more impoverished erm so we like spent about an hour at the airport to work out how exactly to get into where we were going
A	yeah
B	with cars all over and
A	and people are there for a purpose
B	there's tooting and there's it's very smelly
A	uhu
B	um sort of really really it's just like so crazy and then we had to try and call a taxi and erm this is we realized we couldn't get a taxi because erm he was like yeah yeah man you want two two of these fingers and
B	and erm we're like oh
A	yeah
B	because otherwise they wouldn't be
A	yeah
B	and so we handed him over a thousand cos that's all you can get out of the ATMs
A	yeah
B	and we only gave seven hundred on the way back
A	yeah
B	from then on you have to be quite careful it's weird though because of it's like the only place we've been where you know I think in England I think it's a law that they have to use the meter or something
B	no but in erm in Thailand you get all the taxis that were going in certain touristy areas and they'll put a cloth over the meter they call it the
C	yeah
B	they'll only do a pre-negotiated bumped up fare so
A	oh it's like in
B	yeah no you have to like pre-negotiate a fee and yeah what we found is a couple of times we have to be like how much
A	yeah
B	and then eventually with a bit of haggling it will be just like
A	yeah
A	what did you do when you got to the hotel?
B	we just
A	did you go out?
B	it's like an epicentre for yeah it's like an epicentre for groups of like various Westerners crossing paths erm all coming into like very erm western culture to
A	really
B	so that like
A	yeah
B	erm so we went
B	because you know in
A	yeah
B	and we just didn't want to
A	I'm
B	no cos they're so like stuffed for space on a plane but whereas on a train there's plenty of room
A	yeah
B	but erm
A	mm
B	erm and then we arrived in Shanghai in about seven hours and when we off the train and there was a tourist information centre and so we go up there to ask where to stay and this man was really nice
A	yeah
B	and erm erm he said we'll just grab some more people and then we'll take you for free to your hotel
A	oh dodge
B	and then basically it all unfolded and we got there and we weren't like forced into staying there but it turns out all the people at the tourist information booths were various different owners of the different hotels so where you stayed depended on who you spoke to at the tourist information booth and which hotel they owned so he just whisked us off to his hotel it was really nice though and that was actually probably the nicest place we stayed by far
A	yeah
B	but erm it was just really weird cos I the tourism is so corrupt in these small areas that there's no like official
A	yeah but it's like
B	mm
B	yeah
A	why didn't you just go to the maps?
B	yeah we did but erm the point is we got a lot of that in some places
A	but yeah why are people like that?
B	I don't know but you got that in places like that and then you've got
B	but erm
A	why
B	because like it's very beautiful but like you see it on TV and it looks amazing but it's very sticky and insects attacking you but you can put on whatever Deet you want but you get attacked by mosquitoes so you have to wear as much clothes as you can to try and put off the mosquitoes
B	at the same time as trying to take off as many clothes as possible because it's so hot
A	yeah
B	and erm yeah that was a bit so you end up covering like over a period of a day you would like
A	how many days
B	two days so we tracked it up to some small village stayed in like a bamboo hut and then erm we tracked
A	it was
B	well it was me and
A	were they nice?
B	yeah they were all quite like erm
B	it was like Jordy
A	a bit
B	a bit
A	yeah
C	it's like when we went onto erm Safari into the desert in
C	they'd obviously been on like desert wear dot com
B	how old were they?
C	they were bit older like thirty or forty
B	so did you sleep out in the
C	we didn't we were we were just like there was like a fire which went down and we just sat along and looked at the stars all night but
B	oh right cos
C	yeah so we just
B	how long was that visit
C	well I was terrified I was gonna get bitten by a snake or scorpion
B	were you right out in the barren desert?
C	one of them run over me like just as I went to sleep
B	a snake?
C	no like erm some kind of scorpion
B	well that's a pretty scary wait how long were you out there for?
C	we were there for like two days
B	and was it like you were sleeping in the open desert or was it
C	no it was just an open desert
B	well that's pretty crazy the stars must have been amazing
C	they were
B	okay
C	it was actually really fun
B	how are camels compare to horses?
C	well
B	they're quite horrible
C	no they're not they were
B	how many hours?
C	erm two
B	so you sat between the humps?
C	yeah
B	that's cool
C	the one in front was like really greedy and would keep stopping to eat and obviously all the others were like attached to the guy in front so whatever that one stopped everyone else would have to stop
B	what would it stop to eat then?
C	like erm well it looked like twigs but it's like a twiggy
B	oh
B	what else did you do there?
C	erm
C	uh yeah we went for about ten days
B	stay in a five star hotel the whole time?
C	no no no it was like
B	do you know
C	it was such a nightmare
C	and especially since you don't have like Google map or that we didn't even have a map
B	oh yeah
C	well we had a we had a map
C	that was not the biggest problem it was finding hotels I think
C	yeah
B	you could try and find a nice one and then you have to
C	yeah
C	yeah
B	cos like all these places are
C	yeah
B	and when we actually
C	yeah
B	and like
C	oh my god see we got lucky but
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	so
B	yeah so that I think if you don't know the place
C	yeah but it's a lot less hassle knowing that you're going to stay with them
B	yeah well me and
C	I think it depends where you're going because
B	oh
C	you know I would not have wanted to like
B	how much
C	about ten pounds four pence
B	that's not too bad
C	no
B	it's weird
C	yeah yeah
B	so what else did you do for ten days? just shopping?
A	we went
B	mm
C	so we so we kind of went down there
B	so they would like follow
C	yeah
C	so
C	only went to the beach once
B	so the Moroccan sea
C	yeah
B	was it warm?
C	yeah it was warm
B	I'm sure it's got quite a lot of exotic creatures in
C	well
B	now wait you were with
C	oh yeah she was there for the first couple of days
B	oh okay
C	but um because that was
B	oh well what did she go off on her own and then?
C	erm no and then she went home cos she was teaching next weekend she just came out for that weekend but
B	blimey
C	for hotel
B	that's
C	erm but yeah and then we got the train to
B	yeah
C	so then the next day it was like you know trousers and a full long sleeve shirt and head scarves and we were still getting
B	some of my friends were there for
C	if you're with a girl I think maybe it's easier
C	but actually cos it was me and
B	wow
B	yeah we have manners in the same way
C	nobody they they just get all their English off like English like off American movies stars and the stuff they come out with is like so inappropriate and doesn't make any sense
B	yeah
C	but they think oh see we understand and it was just like oh after like I just got so bored after a while but you just couldn't go you just had to continue
B	oh me and
C	and then you just stop acknowledging people but it's not even really
B	well we just got to the point when you walk down the street and
C	but it it just turned into where you just don't trust anyone and we had such an awkward situation did I tell you about this caf√© we went to? we were outside a library there and we were looking to go into the library and we were oh god someone is going to try and sell us stuff and we were like no like go away
C	so then he started to like say say stuff to me in German and then he was like translate it to her in Greek
C	no no no he didn't speak Greek he spoke German but he spoke to me in German and obviously I and he was like no can you translate now Greek to her so that she's a part of the conversation?
C	and then I was just like oh my god
B	erm we got a guy we were trying to get into the palace and it was huge
A	which palace?
B	one of the big palaces
A	yeah
B	and it's probably like a couple of miles long and obviously
C	oh no that's always the way when
B	yeah I mean and then he was like erm it's erm it's closed for lunch but erm and then he was like but we can show you some other stuff to do and yeah he was like I'll show you some other stuff to do but it reopens in a couple of hours and he was like no no I'll tell you what
C	yeah
B	that means it's a scam because any arrangement between
C	yeah
B	erm so we walked away and then we
C	oh good
B	so it was a big disheartening
C	but you got in?
B	yeah then it was like thirty quid
C	that's ridiculous
B	mm so we didn't bother with that
C	yeah
B	er
C	it is funny how different countries work
B	yeah but they do all speak quite good English considering the state of their education in Thailand though but I suppose it's cos it's like their whole industry
C	tourist
B	it's it's
C	mm
B	compared to other countries
C	yeah
B	but I'd quite like to be in Vietnam or somewhere I think that's like I think
C	really?
B	like what was it?
C	yeah
B	cos like it's become more of a like holiday like lots of big holiday resorts and stuff
C	yeah
B	like very like you know like the Greek islands and stuff? it's become a bit like that so I don't know it's not really my thing
[ANNOTATION]	The greek islands are too much of a tourist destination	Entailment
C	I hate touristy areas
B	yeah
C	like I'd much rather go somewhere where like when I went to Spain it was so good cos all of my friends were like Spanish and knew exactly where to take me and exactly
B	yeah like when we were in Turkey
B	I think that was the other end of the stick where it's the opposite
[ANNOTATION]	Both speakers don't like touristy areas	Entailment
C	well they didn't take us anywhere
B	oh yeah they took us to that to a river
C	what river?
B	I swear we went on a river
C	no that was at a lake wasn't it?
B	that was quite
C	oh yeah
B	that was quite good
C	that was nice
[ANNOTATION]	Going on lakes or rivers is nice	Entailment
B	and that was like
C	until we got back
B	oh
B	there's that day and the day when mum had a migraine and we all went away
C	yeah
B	the two best days weren't they?
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B's mum never gets migraines	Contradiction
C	yeah those were the two best days that
B	that was the day when mum like passed out wasn't it?
C	mm
B	oh
C	mm but erm yeah Spain was good er you you've never been have you?
B	no
C	we went to like the mountains
B	how hot are they?
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B has never been to Spain	Entailment
C	oh my god you would love it you would love it
B	why?
C	it's like the mountains above Madrid and it was like not that hot but like er nice hot so it wasn't humid or dry it was just like perfect temperature and you could climb up into the mountains and like there'd just be these waterfalls all the way through and you could like the plunge pools were huge so you could jump in and swim in them like go under waterfalls
B	in countries like this water is so like
C	and then climb up into the mountains like the views were like incredible like
B	like the views in America?
B	but but without the rocks it's all all like trees it's like a big valley
B	and is it more densely?
C	mm more like yeah unbelievably dense like just densely treed bits of the
B	treed
C	technical term but we'd like I I this was on like the second day obviously I hadn't driven in about a year and they're so chilled about driving lets like like here's there's so much like safety caution and everything and apparently I was insured to drive the car like
B	what car?
C	it's on like the other side of the road it was er it was
C	er no well they're like learning to drive they haven't passed the test no
B	how old are your friends then?
C	mm oh same age as me
B	bit late to start driving isn't it?
C	well they're probably not home very much to learn or they're just too chilled
B	so wait how many people from Germany were there? was it just one friend?
C	no no no no
C	it was like loads it was about this was so weird like from
B	oh right okay
C	like it's so weird so like
B	oh okay
C	so like it's so it's like such a small world so when I went to Spain he was there
B	mm
C	so like a lot of people if they live outside Europe they'll just go to Spain for summer and then go back home for Christmas or something maybe but I dunno it's all very different
B	where's
C	he currently lives in
B	I thought
C	but he has a flat in
B	I thought
C	yeah but he couldn't travel because of his heart
B	yeah but
C	his family he's he's half American
B	oh
C	his his aunt lives in in fact where
C	yeah
B	that's good yeah
C	erm well it's in
B	yeah
C	well his he left home at like sixteen so his grandparents bought him and his sister a flat
B	how is his heart?
C	erm
B	so is he waiting for a transplant?
C	he's on the list yeah
B	but far from
C	well he isn't like I don't know he keeps going on emergency going further up the list and then obviously going back down so and like it doesn't really work in that it's like someone it's like who whoever needs a heart most urgently will get it so he's on the list but it doesn't mean that he'll necessarily get one within the next couple of years
B	about how well is
C	erm I don't know
B	so he couldn't go to
C	erm I think well the thing is he was meant to go in erm when was it last February or no no like May June but he keeps on having panic attacks so
B	what cos he's scared of flying?
C	oh no no no it's like his family is like a complete mess
B	oh gosh
C	it like just triggers itself
C	no it's
B	how horrible
B	what's his
C	his wife is from
B	that's awful
C	yeah
B	do they really trust him up there?
C	yeah
B	there's always
B	yes but do you see him
C	well
B	but do you see him?
C	well he's coming out for
B	so is he studying at home?
C	well he's doing like a post grad so that's not really like if you imagine
B	and
C	no he's in
C	he missed the audition to
B	okay
C	yeah but anyway it's not so bad because they didn't have a VHS
B	yeah he wouldn't be able to get drunk
C	well no and like he he'd be leaving
C	but his teacher is like the
B	yeah
B	so what does he teach you?
C	he doesn't teach me but he
C	yeah
B	how is
B	how how
B	how far
C	like I can hold a conversation understand lessons get by but it's definite
B	do you just speak English or German
C	well most of my friends prefer to speak English but in the general class we all speak German to each other and if I want to speak German I can just speak German because it's just like
B	so do you think that you do you not think that it might be easier to learn if your friends speak German to you? you're forced into learning?
C	yeah but everybody speaks English at school
B	isn't but it's Germany surely I mean I know they choose to but surely generally speaking they have to speak German
C	yeah they do but they also want to speak English like people who want to speak English
B	are they always really good at it?
C	yeah but it's so funny because this this guy who moved there this year he learnt English from watching
C	and I would just be like sorry
C	it was so funny he would say you little plonker and I was like okay this is so funny
B	does he wait does he have like the accent?
C	yeah yeah he does well he's a bit of a bad boy anyway but he just like bigs it up a little more but he
B	yeah
C	the worse are the French though for sure
B	they're bad?
C	oh my god their accent but they don't even they don't even pretend
B	oh they have very heavy French accents as well
C	yeah it's really funny
B	but their French accent's quite nice
C	oh it's
B	oh
A	so when are you going back?
C	Tuesday
A	for Christmas
C	yeah I might come back some time later but we'll have to see
A	yeah
A	so how does that work? would you come back that far?
C	yeah
A	well no but for practices and for concerts and how do you how do you be in concerts if you can't
C	oh it's not for a concert it's like an interview for orchestra so you just come back
A	oh for when you're finished
C	not even well for when I finish this experience like apart from
A	well that's exciting
A	so if you succeed would they would they wait for you or would they want you to
C	well if I got through they would want me to do a trial and a trial period so like they'd ask you to do like certain concerts during the year and the concerts will have probably have a week of rehearsals so maybe they're doing a concert in Birmingham and concert in Cornwall and somewhere else in London and they like give the dates and you know you can say oh yeah I can do this one and this one and this one and go and do those and then gradually they'll stop asking you about four concerts like if you do one concert and completely fuck it up they'll be like okay and just won't ask you for another concert and if you do well they'll ask you for another one and then after a year or something they would say
A	oh I see
C	so it's
A	so it's kind of an extended interview?
C	yeah
A	oh
C	so
C	I don't know but like they they won't offer a post until they know because a lot of them have connections so they won't offer any place
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	because they said it's erm the next one is in early October and I
C	yeah
B	erm October the third or fourth I think so all my mates are leaving at the moment they started going off they started very late compared to everybody else
A	uhu
A	are you gonna live in?
B	sorry
A	are you going to live in?
B	oh yeah I've got
C	what are you gonna do
C	do you like it?
A	yeah I loved it I got off the bus I did all my interviews and I got off the bus and I thought oh this one this one
C	yeah
A	yeah
A	erm
A	uhu well it was if you wanted to erm in our day erm you had to have two languages to study history and you had to do an entrance exam and you had to pass the entrance exam and they are much less erm there was an awful lot of competition by professors
C	yeah
A	I mean it's still like that but
C	yeah
B	now why don't you
A	yeah
B	always gonna be a regret for him
C	that's only because
A	he used to be
B	one of my friends who erm
A	no no
B	perhaps because his grades went down
A	no no
A	biggest regret in his life
A	um
B	I think like no he still talks about it
A	oh what does he say?
B	um they were talking
A	uhu
B	erm a situation like a similar like Animal Farms you know that book?
A	yeah
B	well that's
A	an example
B	with the same principals of the
A	yeah
B	um anyway he tried to describe it in terms of if
B	because he wanted to stick to his original argument
A	oh but but was he studying economics?
B	it was economics and history I think
A	economists there are loads of economists who take that view
B	no but he's but it like he's interviewer really didn't obviously his interviewer was quite socialist or whatever and didn't like him at all
B	especially that comment and the fact that he was being so stubborn about it that he'd say he let a child drown but um his
A	oh
B	but he thought it had gotten in as well thought he had and then he got the letter that said no
A	oh that would take him a while to get over it
A	it depends I mean you might have really good
A	oh he'll love it at
B	yeah
A	I'm surprised that they gave him a place if you'd let a child drown they really are supposed to be um
B	yeah
A	pretty much erm left wing
A	well they used to be I don't know if they are these days
B	that's interesting
A	well my grandma when I was when I my grandma was worried about me going to
C	police
A	yeah
B	mm
A	so anyway we're just coming up to the end of the tape so I think fifty-five fifty-nine fifty-six minutes so we can stop now if you wanted
B	alright lovely
A	good I just need you to fill in some forms
B	yeah
A	so that's good here's the forms here's one for you
