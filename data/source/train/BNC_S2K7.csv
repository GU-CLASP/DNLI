B	yeah so erm I couldn't believe it because erm it seems like
C	mm
B	the reason why the dog
C	her
C	yeah
B	is because
C	mm
B	for I guess health and safety reasons
D	yeah
C	right
B	of course it's it's obviously not his erm
C	yeah
B	it's not his farm
C	right
B	he can't decide
C	mm
B	and there's no erm there's no dogs allowed
C	right
B	so if he was to have the dog
C	mm
B	she would be in the kennel
D	dad
C	right and that's not fair
B	she's kept outside she's kept outside
C	yeah
B	she's already been started off as a pet
C	mm
B	she'd be kept outside in a kennel and erm
C	you know who
B	probably
B	yeah
C	cos I think
D	sorry I missed that so the dog
C	yeah the the dog would have ended up having to be in the
D	sorry what was the
C	yeah but he's not the dog's not allowed in the farm so the dog would have ended up having been a pet ended up in the kennel
D	oh at home?
C	yeah at at the farm
D	while they're at while they're at work
C	yeah
D	oh right
C	at at at at the farm if
D	what farm? I thought they were living in a house or
A	no as in like during the day when
C	on the estate
D	yeah I know
B	yeah
C	mm
D	but
C	the house goes with the job
D	yes oh right okay
C	mm
D	oh right
B	so he just put
C	mm mm
D	right okay
B	so she'd be in a kennel
D	I'm I'm with it now
B	yeah
D	cos I went to work your mum went to work and we let
B	it should be it should be in a kennel
D	it's alright I didn't realise the house went with the job
C	mm mm
A	yeah
B	yeah it does
D	right
B	erm so yeah
C	pet
B	a pet so far
C	mm mm
B	erm but yeah
C	yeah
A	but but I also think because obviously er conflict of interest there so I felt like
C	was in the house
A	yeah
C	yeah
E	this lamb lamb?
D	it's lamb
E	yeah
D	but
E	very nice
B	what cut is it? it's very tender
C	lovely
D	this is actually offcuts from where they've been jointing so it'll be leg or shoulder
B	butchers or
D	butchers
B	it's very nice
C	absolutely delicious
A	I didn't like it
A	I thought it was horrible
C	there is another one do you want some more?
C	there is another one you either have it tonight or you take it with you
B	we're going to have so much food aren't we?
C	mm
A	yeah I've got to make
C	but you can take it with you
A	some baking to do tomorrow night
C	right
B	when it would erm
C	a bit close to home wasn't it?
D	it's the fact that it's
B	that's lovely
D	two best mates with two sisters
A	mm
B	mm
C	yeah
D	now the thing is
C	yeah
D	certainly for me or
C	we don't know is
D	is
A	yeah
C	you've had more time with
A	yeah and it it hasn't even been a lot
C	no
B	she's been
A	yeah she seems sweet enough though
B	yeah I'm kind of glad that it was
C	uhu
B	otherwise
C	oh yeah
B	if
C	cheated
B	cheated
C	yeah
B	then it could have been bad and
A	as in it would have been like
D	yeah but having said that got to remember that
B	for
C	yeah
D	ah
A	yeah I
B	well no he didn't leave her for
D	well
C	no
B	that was his ex
D	that was his ex previous one
A	yeah
C	and then
C	hadn't he?
B	yeah
D	ah well
A	they live in quite like a little close knit community though stuff like that will happen
C	yeah it's all a bit odd
B	I think
A	yeah
C	yeah the
C	do you think so?
D	well it's his daughter
C	I know but
B	oh yeah
D	as long as there's no nasty
C	recriminations
A	no it sounds like even
C	good
A	yeah
D	the next day
A	stuff happens
B	well I think it's good
A	it seems like he's had to deal with a lot worse though
C	well he has
D	oh yeah
B	just a little bit
C	yeah
B	yeah I said didn't I?
A	him and his mum wasn't it?
C	mm
A	yeah
C	we don't know
E	yes
C	should you need it
A	I just looked it looks so tasty
C	it's lovely and it's all of this in the middle as well
B	er
C	oh
C	mm?
C	in Newcastle from here?
B	yep
C	have you got a company car then?
B	yep
C	oh
B	yep
C	so have you come at separate in separate cars then?
B	no
C	then how are you getting there?
B	get picked up by
C	mm
B	to get over to
C	mm mm
B	to leave
C	mm mm
B	because our boss decided that he'd take the company car back
C	mm mm
B	when we're all insured on it
C	mm mm
B	when it makes perfect sense for
C	mm mm
B	as she's the first she dropped she picked me up
C	mm mm
B	in in fact if we're going to
C	mm
B	just around that area in
C	mm mm
B	but no
C	oh well
B	it's it's really nice but she's done like a hundred and twenty thousand miles on it but you can barely tell or be able to tell
C	that's good it says a lot for the Audi doesn't it?
B	well yeah
D	oh have you thought about what you're doing with that car as yet?
B	no
C	mm
B	if I start applying for other jobs erm there's are two jobs that are in of interest aren't they er one that I'd been walking to work
C	mm mm
B	and the other one I'd life share with
C	mm
B	we probably
D	well I'm just
C	this winter
D	this winter
B	well get through won't we? we'll be alright it's not like you go above seventy cos you're always in traffic
B	so I'm not worried
A	my car makes worse noises when it's going slow
B	going slower
D	yeah
B	similar
A	making a fairly similar noise
A	yeah
B	I think it's absolutely fine and there's no no reason to worry
C	we know
A	we are regularly checking stuff and trying to be sensible about
B	all I know is my car passed its MOT and the only the only problem they had was the fact that that they they took down my air fresheners from my rearview mirror that's the only thing I noticed
C	oh and it it's gone has it?
A	they took down your air fresheners?
B	yeah cos it was to to pass the MOT it could have any
A	that's hilarious
B	yeah so they took them down put them on my passenger seat and said there you go there's your car back and then I
D	and you had to put them back up
B	had to put them up
D	what else to do? anything else they checked?
B	erm the tyre tread on the front two tyres on the inside was three point zero eight they said you can go down to one point six
D	yeah you can that's the
B	and that was it
C	mm
B	they're like that that's it
D	did they check your air con?
B	er no you'd obviously have to pay extra for that and I said no it'll be alright thanks
D	okay and er
B	I don't need air con at the moment
D	no I know I know what about the starting?
B	erm they said if you want to do a diagnostics test on electronics it would be sixty-five pounds and we can't fit that in today cos it'll take about forty-five minutes and it was a Saturday morning so right okay so if you wanna book that in it'll be sixty-five pounds just for the test I was like mm
A	she seems to think all they'll probably do is reprogram the keys because what she thinks is that
B	but that could cost money
A	yeah she thinks that whatever coding as originally put in place to link the keys up to the car has somehow
B	it just got slightly confused
A	it got slightly confused
C	ah
A	so that's why sometimes it doesn't
D	which is what came up which is what came up on the log
B	yeah
D	when I was reading it it was about the
B	yeah I read I read you can just lock it six times and then unlock it six times and it resets the key or something something weird like that
C	I'd have liked to have been around when that was discovered that was a
B	don't really wanna risk it though
A	like oh da da da da da oh it's fixed
B	yeah but that but that'll be leaked by Hyundai
C	a bit Family Guy really isn't it?
D	did you hear today on the on er news
C	mm mm
D	Hyundai are now the first car manufacturer that you don't have to go through a dealership to buy a car you do it all online
C	never
B	Dassius and Dero
D	direct
C	do they?
A	weren't Hyundai in the news for negative reasons the other day though? I I swear they ended up having to pay a load of customers a load of money
B	dunno I like them
D	and they have the head of head of Hyundai UK
A	it was on the news but I did pay enough attention
D	and they didn't want and they were saying there was a group of people now who doesn't want to get sold
A	I think it would be a bit stupid to do that though
D	the car will be delivered to your door you won't be able to test drive it mind you but of course because it's
C	mm mm
D	you've got fourteen days to return it if you don't like it
A	but I don't get it because like in theory
C	oh I'd like to buy that car
A	a lot of the deals and stuff that you get are from you going in and like
B	personal touch
A	bartering a little bit
C	uh huh
A	if you just bought like online you're basically buying it at like face value
D	no ah ah
C	yeah
D	well this is this is the point you've got to remember that the deals you get go back to what Hyundai have passed the car onto their dealership for cos the Hyundai have got to make that mark up
A	mm
D	the dealership have got to make a mark up there
C	oh so you're buying it there
D	and in fact what you're technically buying
C	is there
D	not the dealership
C	but dealers dealerships are gonna disappear they're shafting their own dealers
A	well dealerships
B	good yeah they have good deals
A	I don't know how but they were
C	well cos they have to
A	but then actually that was through a finance deal so obviously they were making money on the
C	on the finance
C	yeah yeah ah yeah
D	sorry this this was sorry so yeah this was just straight figures boom nothing
A	yeah
D	so of course if if Hyundai say a car is worth well round figures a lot lower
C	mm mm
D	well for the dealership to make a profit on it forgetting any add ons they might want they've got to sell it for twelve
A	a couple of grand more yeah
C	mm
D	and so you go in and if you twist and oh well yeah well I'll pop that on and I'll put this on
C	mm mm
D	but then by the time you've added all the extras on it's back up to
A	yeah
D	gap
C	mm
B	what's gap insurance?
A	it's where it's basically you're insuring won't necessarily like give you the full value like of that you paid for they car they'll give you the full value of what they what they deem the car to be worth so
B	okay so
A	obviously the car loses value when you drive off the forecourt
D	the second
C	the forecourt yes
D	the second you drive off the forecourt it loses X percent if you hit something or somebody hits you
B	five second after that
D	five seconds after that your car and that's all the insurance company'll pay
A	it's what they do
D	gap insurance puts it back to its original value
B	how long for? a year or something
D	it depends how long you take the insurance out for
B	whatever
C	that's
A	they tried to sell me that as well
D	er you bought that didn't you Mrs?
C	I think I did I think I did I think I did
C	yes I was at the time
D	I wanted the erm waxed effect or something so I never had to wax polish the car
C	the car yeah
D	I need to wash it to find out if it works
B	what about diamond thing or whatever it was
D	oh that diamond bright that was it yes well done that was a Scotch something on the
C	yeah the interior do you know when I get in there to clean it it comes up a treat
D	but the reason your mum went for the gap was was it
B	be better than the gap yes something happened with
C	yeah
D	a golf
C	yeah yeah yeah
D	a brand new golf that was written off within weeks or something
C	something happened with
B	what happened?
C	can't remember can't remember there was
B	what's the story here? what's the story here?
A	well basically what happened was it it's particularly important finance deals because
D	yes
A	because if you're paying off a car that's
C	you finished that?
A	if your car's written off and the insurance company are only willing to pay you eight you've got four K to make up yeah
D	I'm sorry I'm the only one
C	you've let yourself down
D	you full up?
C	yes he's let himself down that's the thing
D	so yes no no so so
A	I don't know if I've told you before though like when it comes to that kind of when I whenever people try to upsell me stuff
C	mm mm
A	my go to is to just say no and I get really like I always feel like they're trying to con me
B	yeah backs straight up against the wall
A	yeah my back's straight as soon as I think oh you're trying to sell me stuff that's extra I just say no I'm like no and then we walk out and
C	it's the best way
D	this is the problem that that's where they make their extra money the the
A	yeah
B	and it might be a really good deal for you but they're they're trying to get money
C	yeah
D	and the trouble is you now know everybody is savvy to it
A	yeah
D	I mean I can remember when we bought
C	oh yes
D	so we didn't have to spend the time washing up
C	oh yes
D	and equally when they were brand new not we didn't know anybody who had got one apart from mum and dad
B	a microwave
D	a microwave and I can still remember buying er got knows where we got the dishwasher but I can still remember buying the microwave from Dixons
B	Dixons Currys yeah
D	in
B	oh yeah
D	and they I
B	it must be downstairs near
A	it's where Superdrug is yeah
B	yeah
D	and I was persuaded to buy and I did I bought because where do you go to get a microwave fixed if it goes wrong well the fact that
D	no but they weren't they were a hundred and god knows and it was a lot of money in those days it was more than a week's wages to buy
B	yeah
D	probably more than two weeks wages thinking about it to buy a microwave and we bought this thing and I bought oh my god that was the microwave I actually gave it to somebody when we had the kitchen redone this is
B	yeah the one in
B	the one at grandma's?
D	yeah it's an original Philips
B	Philips one of the first microwaves
D	oh god there were so many buttons on it
B	but it doesn't spin does it?
D	no
A	the ones at work don't spin but I think that's because they've actually like developed clever ones that can somehow circulate the heat
B	well I think this is a clever one too
D	it is a clever one
B	it's a pretty good one innit?
D	it is it's about that big
D	it's about half the size of this table
B	you walk out of the back door into the old utility room
A	erm do you know what I was doing before I fell asleep last night? I was looking at land buying
B	land to buy
A	we've been watching a lot of
D	you're not buying a house up building a house
A	we've been watching a lot of Grand Designs and it's filling my head with stupid ideas so I was looking at land
D	there was something there was something on oh and I was trying I missed it and it was I heard the ad or the whatever they call it on the radio when it says you know something's coming up and it was a section and they said it was
A	yeah
D	now blooming heck you're going to think of doing it
C	lemon tart or a lemon cheesecake
A	or both
C	or both lemon tart and some vanilla cheesecake
C	lemon tart okay
A	well it's only because
B	it's cheap
A	it's cheap and you can get so much more house for your money like these people on Grand Designs they spend X amount and nearly always their house is worth two or three times what they've spent
B	yeah at least
A	yeah
D	if you think of all that
A	mm
B	they love it
A	but you you get like a custom made house that's so cool
B	sorry to use quite strong language but they always fuck up
D	oh I know
B	and yet their house is so successful
D	well
D	no thanks I might do actually I don't er yeah I'll I'll let you know we were coming back from well we come back erm from King's Cross and we were trying to work out there was a guy with
C	just
D	there was a guy who er did this south of Peterborough
C	yeah it was like a cube wasn't it?
D	and it was south of Peterborough
C	yeah
D	and
C	in a woodland
D	it was in woodland and was sure that it's the woodland you see
C	from the train? no on the way down
D	about seven or eight minutes before you can pull in and I mean for years I've been looking out trying to see it but you can't see it because the water's so thick
A	yeah
D	and I'm sure that's where he is
C	mm
D	but I always had and somebody actually I think has possibly done it well I always do you remember when we were up in Scotland we went left mum in the car and you
D	I can't remember it was the end of the we went we walked we bought a tree we snapped the top off
B	mm well
C	Loch Fyne
D	Loch Fyne
B	oh it was up north yeah
D	okay
C	mm
D	but we parked at the top of the loch and we left the car on the other side of the road and you
B	mm
D	right
B	a castle
D	a castle
A	mm mm
B	mum wouldn't come?
D	and I er mum wouldn't come
B	she was terrified
D	she said she was terrified
C	mm
D	and I wanted to buy that place
B	someone did didn't they?
D	and this is it I saw it come up and couldn't believe it I thought it was you know the equivalent of English Heritage
C	hideous
D	or whatever they call it
C	mm
B	possibly
D	cos when he got inside he got a tower house the old original Scottish
C	mm
D	admittedly in the middle of the courtyard one of the corner tops of
B	corner
D	the tower house had fallen and was actually lying there in the middle of the courtyard and then
C	it was frightening
B	frightening
D	I think it was after probably the
D	I assume the last rebellion was at the seventeen whatever
B	no one here knows
D	the Bonnie Prince
D	no roof no nothing and that was the bit you could have turned into an actually into a proper house and then you could have slowly converted the
B	it was marshland either side and a track going to it er so it missed the all around and then the lock behind it which was amazing
D	that was Loch Fyne
C	spooky it was so spooky so spooky
B	there's something very similar on a on a BBC advert and on and and the
D	it was
C	oh
D	in seventeen something
B	yeah
D	and one of the rebuilds is
B	a a white horse at the end
D	but the horse standing there
B	just yeah
B	you
C	mm
D	or you walk someone look at an openly
C	PDQ
D	we got we got oysters and smoked mussels
C	mm it was lovely wasn't it?
B	what do what what does PDQ stand for?
C	pretty damn quick
B	wow
B	cool cool kid there
C	that was beautiful beautiful fish
D	we got back we got back and we had to drive all the way back to nearly to Glasgow
C	yeah
D	and er course we're then presented with well let's have the oysters with no
C	it's gorgeous absolutely gorgeous
D	no idea how to open an oyster
C	any more?
A	no I'm good thank you
B	no
C	dad
D	so there's me in the kitchen of a of a holiday cottage trying to work out how to open an oyster
C	brilliant really good wasn't it?
D	it was fine yeah apart from when I slipped and put the screwdriver straight into the palm of my hand
C	oh
A	I know I
C	yeah
A	it's just a lot of you invest so much energy
C	yeah
A	like everybody like there's always shots of them like halfway through the build where like nothing's quite going right and they all look so deflated
C	do you know what? do you know what? if you could survive that wallpaper
A	well barely
C	says it all says it all
A	the one thing we do criticise on Grand Designs though is the people that go in without a proper plan
C	what was Kevin saying you read er an interview with Kevin
D	oh very small
C	a very small proportion of the people he actually likes
A	really?
D	he doesn't like a lot of them
C	yeah
A	some of them are really irritation cos they they they fall into a band of like arrogance a lot of the time cos they
B	river yeah
C	mm
A	in amongst all these like really beautiful traditional places
D	oh yes I've seen that yeah
C	yes
B	middle aged no kids
C	yeah
A	and all of their all of their neighbours hated the plans all of them hated
B	it did not fit
A	did not want anything etcetera and then like at the end Kevin's interviewing the neighbours he's like oh you know like now it's here like what do you think and the neighbours are like it's ugly I hate it like it doesn't go with anything else on the river and then it pans to them in their living room they're like well we don't care like they just they just can't understand and all this kind of
B	they don't appreciate
A	they don't appreciate the beauty and it's like oh these are your neighbours now for the very distant future and you've just decided to like
C	yes
A	annoy them all and and like
C	yes
B	but but one of the the house was so close to one of the neighbours
C	yes
B	that their balcony at the end of their garden cos it was a
D	mm
B	and the one we watched after that some guy er a couple they they seemed alright but he was just a bit eccentric and just was just winging it
A	yeah
B	erm clearly had a bit of a doss throughout his life and just managed to get by and actually make a bit of money erm but yeah they were building erm a forty grand plot in London and I mean like you'd put a garage on it and that was it managed to fit a one storey like pretty cool house in there that was was very cheap very cool house
A	yeah
B	but it was outside the neighbours it was just it was less than a foot between the neighbours' window and that house
C	horrible
B	and it covered the window
A	yeah
C	that's terrible
B	why would you do that?
D	that's yeah I think the the problem I have
B	who'd give planning for that?
C	mm mm
D	I mean I have
A	yeah
D	is grand
B	yeah a lot of them aren't
D	and grand actually
D	grand actually comes down to the fact that it's money
A	yeah
C	yeah
D	it's how much it cost
C	yeah
D	it doesn't make it grand
A	that that one on the river cost them like one and a half million I think
D	yeah
A	and I was thinking I was
B	it was all the technology and
A	yeah I was just thinking
B	but it wasn't a big build it wasn't impressive
A	all the things of all the places you could yeah it was a two bed
B	it was basically a one bed
D	I remember that one
A	it was basically a one bed house
C	ah
D	remember that one they did at
C	oh yeah see I thought that was clever
D	you see I thought that was clever
C	I did I thought that was
B	is it grand?
C	it wasn't a grand design it was that one who it was the Caroline Quentin one
B	it was like a bunker wasn't it?
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	and it worked
D	it was the same sort of thing
A	yeah
C	it really worked and they had the seed erm for the on the
D	on the roof
C	on the roof
D	they had these plans
A	yeah
C	for the erm living roof and everything it was very clever but you know Kevin the one that the one the one guy I I always said that Kevin really connected with
C	or liked was the woodsman the
A	the one who built his house
C	of straw bales
D	oh yes
A	yeah and he didn't he get I swear he was told to take it down
C	no he he could I only said because he was the he was a he was
A	there was one of them who had built built it all himself and stuff in the middle of the woods was completely self-sufficient and then
C	yeah
A	but had never got planning permission
C	was he trying to take it down?
A	I'm pretty sure he was told to take it down
C	because he was allowed to have a dwelling because he worked off the land
A	mm not sure
C	was the understanding with that one and he had the solar panels the first solar panels I'd ever seen
A	yeah
C	from the Big Brother house didn't he?
A	it was all some some of them are really like really clever
D	oh I get I'm getting confused now
A	there was erm I was watching one the other day and again it was erm it was on a river think it might have been the Thames again actually
C	yeah
A	and erm they were wherever they was they experienced a lot of flooding and they'd managed to build a mechanism which basically meant that their house rose
D	yeah
C	yes
A	yeah
C	it's like a floating
A	so they and they they had like a basement in that bit but and it was completely watertight so as the water levels rose
C	they tanked it didn't they? they tanked the whole thing
E	yeah it was like a slice of bread and that and have a
C	amazing absolutely
A	for stuff like that it's really impressive
C	yeah yeah
D	dad dad dad would like some cheese
C	yes some cheese
D	processed cheese
C	bit of cheese
D	erm but I get confused now between
C	we have cheese
D	between Kevin
C	would you like some bread and cheese or do you want crackers
D	Caroline
B	Caroline
D	Caroline
C	bread will be lovely it's nice bread lovely bread
D	what's his name?
E	yes it looks nice
A	the younger guy
C	I'll get you I'll get you a knife
D	restoration
A	yeah
D	George
B	I like him
A	is he the one that likes all the creative stuff?
C	we do we like George he's er erm
A	the the guy who likes all the weird creative stuff
D	yeah he's the one that's
A	yeah
D	he
B	he's done a couple of episodes no a series called George
A	yeah
B	erm
A	are they the ones that try to make the door the round door and they wanted it to open in a cool way?
B	yeah
A	yeah
D	who did that church that young couple so and it kept flooding
B	solutions to things
C	she
B	and to for it to be a bit more erm quirky
A	yeah
C	no
B	he used to do this thing where
D	in the church
C	George
B	he'd go into a normal house a house like your mums
C	the one in in the one in er Lancashire Cumbria
B	try and get a
D	there was a chap
C	oh on the river on the river that's that's
A	this big living area called the kitchen sacrifice like the living area and what can I do? first thing to always do was just
D	oh right
A	knock a wall through
B	no no no to empty it yeah absolutely empty it and paint the whole thing white
D	I hope it's not too hard would you like some spread?
B	and then you're walking around like
C	thank you darlings
B	not bad actually there's quite a lot of space in it and he'd be like okay so what you what you space that you've got now using that space is that you can rearrange things and just have it straight away you've already gained here here and there but will start knocking it through and then then he'll go through like he can take this wall out and can't take that wall out and next thing you know you've got a really small house that is really big
A	like really real
B	yeah and then
A	it was definitely something just
D	I was just thinking about how your piece of
B	mum do you know on it's

D	with a drawbridge
C	that was stunning wasn't it?
D	somebody had obviously bought
C	the land with a ruin
D	with a castle on a ruin
C	it was stunning
D	and they'd somehow managed to put another building inside it which was not new by the looks of it it looks as if it could have been two three four hundred years old
C	yeah but modernisment must have been gorgeous
D	and it was rated like you get in Suffolk it was painted bright pink got photographs of it somewhere with a thatched roof on it and there's still medieval towers and this cottage
C	it was lovely wasn't it?
D	it was fantastic with a drawbridge over a moat
B	who'd have thunk it?

B	Currys Argos places like that

A	oh good I'm glad
C	and erm
E	thank you
B	cool
C	the wedding
A	was a shambles
C	that
A	yeah I don't I don't know the ins and outs of it but she said she didn't really have a nice time
C	she didn't
B	why what happened?
A	well she said
C	yeah cos
A	that's such bad planning who plans a wedding like forty miles away
B	she does the auntie and
A	oh no she's really weird
B	weird people
C	yeah
A	they're really weird people
C	it's it's gone off the scale weird
A	yeah
C	I think and erm
A	but she did tell you it was a green card wedding anyway didn't she?
C	ah is it?
C	she said that?
A	he's Algerian
C	yeah yeah
A	yeah yeah
C	oh I thought it was Tunisian he was Algerian yes but I thought they were happy though?
A	erm I don't I don't think
B	he was getting he was getting sent back
A	it's it's yeah it's not that they're it's not like it's not that they're not in a legitimate relationship
B	yeah
A	but they wouldn't have got married if he wasn't being
C	oh right
B	he his visa his student visa ran out
C	right well
B	and he's been living with erm under the radar for a year
C	she did say that when it came to the wedding
B	over a year wasn't it? yeah
C	well she did say that when they had the wedding she said at this like registry whatever it was they were there and they'd actually erm got married and about to sign the book and his sister turned up just in time
A	that's crazy
B	who?
C	his sister don't
B	no that's cool
C	yeah okay
B	that's even better
C	yeah bizarre bizarre
A	yeah
B	so what was wrong with
A	I don't
C	oh they thought it was at one point they thought meningitis but it wasn't she kept being sick kept being kept being sick kept being sick and er in the end I think er
B	yeah
C	I don't think I don't think he got to the wedding
B	good
B	bet he didn't wanna be there
A	well I
C	but
A	I bet they paid a small fortune they were alright to pay for their own flights and stuff I think?
C	yeah and I think I think
B	I wouldn't go
C	yeah the
D	where was the wedding?
C	France
A	France
D	oh alright yeah of course
C	makes sense now?
C	yeah yeah so er but she didn't go and she'd fallen out with
B	who
A	oh right
C	and poor
A	oh so
B	no
A	oh
C	no cos she's pregnant isn't she? oh they
A	I thought you were I thought you were announcing it then
C	no no no no
A	what?
C	no no it's cos she's had the babe that was it I think she must have stayed back with the baby so
A	ah they've got a really tumultuous relationship haven't they from what I can gather
B	I don't know what that means big words
A	but
C	so it was tumultuous
A	yeah
C	oh
A	and erm I think I order for
D	what you
[ANNOTATION]	Person D agree for having some space	Contradiction
A	so as far as I can tell they really really stretched money wise cos
A	they've been given yeah they've been given a dog from
D	given a dog?
A	given a puppy yeah her her dog had puppies and she basically gave them a puppy erm but without thinking about the cost
C	insurance
A	exactly they can't afford they can barely afford apparently month to month as it is
C	that's terrible
A	and now they're gonna take on the
B	they're still both in their twenties
A	yeah
B	late late twenties but twenties
C	mm mm
B	with two two children
A	and their dog to worry about as well
B	and then you don't need a dog do you?
C	no
[ANNOTATION]	Person C think he don't need a dog	Neutral
C	unless it's
A	yeah
D	just be grateful that your mum and I have just well we think for us it's normal
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Person A is going to have a sandwich	Contradiction
D	relatively so I did say I didn't say
B	get get a dog first
A	yeah definitely they'd either have to be old enough to be able to kind of enjoy the fact that they've got a puppy around and actually be able to help out with stuff
D	kettles on for you
C	tell you what would concern me though
D	okay?
A	oh yeah
C	isn't it
B	how is she?
[ANNOTATION]	Person B is worried about her	Entailment
C	she's fine but I think it's time she's gone I don't think she'd been relaxed
B	really?
C	cos they know her that well but she's okay with him
A	but it is hard I think with with animals trying to introduce them to new situations it is difficult you have to try and do as much as you can when they're puppies so they get really acclimatised to it
C	well
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Person B is going to do some hair cut	Contradiction
C	there's definitely a pecking order there
A	yeah
B	no that doesn't matter that actually doesn't matter
C	but if a baby came in it would happen then
A	yeah I I think if they
B	they should it's not about pecking order either
A	no
C	no
B	it's about the first couple of months of the puppies life you need to have them
A	with different dogs with different
B	yeah different different people
C	yeah
B	and then pecking order shouldn't come into it
C	right
B	they should just be familiar
C	gregarious
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	erm cos you know the whole pecking order thing?
C	mm mm
B	they say they say I don't know who they are erm that the experiment about pecking order came from when whoever it was whichever scientist it was put a load of walls together to to monitor it
C	right yeah
B	and they chose walls from different families and just put them together so there was huge fights until a pecking order was was erm established
C	established uhu
B	a bit like there is with with birds and chickens for example but when you monitor actual families actual blood related wolves that doesn't happen
C	right
B	and you have an alpha male and a female but there's no there's no real pecking order because they just know they're just familiar
C	everyone's looked after equally
B	they're born into it
C	yeah
B	so if you get a puppy that's born into these situations
C	yeah
B	and just knows what's not what's what so they know what other dogs are like they know what people are like they know what cats are like
C	yeah
B	like like they will they will have learnt instantly and they will never need to have it enforced by
C	yeah yeah
B	it's not a erm you have to train them they just they're they're familiar with it
C	yeah brilliant
B	which makes sense
A	which is easier said than done like
B	yeah
A	if we were to get a puppy for example now
B	where's the nearest kid cos
A	yeah kid even like another dog really
B	dog yeah cat
A	it'd be hard to like it would be hard to especially like cos I don't think
C	no no no no no no we put it at no
A	oh
C	cos
A	yeah
C	because er one swipe it could blind the dog
B	it won't like he won't but yeah but it can happen
C	he said he knows dogs that have lost an eye yeah
B	erm but that's the thing cos
C	yes exactly
B	so that cat's terrified of dogs
C	yes but a lot of
B	and then to go across the
C	can stand it's
B	and actually
C	yeah
B	chases dogs
C	yeah very different yeah
A	mm
C	oh I've got I've got a story for you from St Paul's Cathedral
B	mass
C	we went that's Catholic darling
B	whatever it is communion
C	communion
B	I don't know what the hell it's called sorry
C	where the
B	had a what a
C	headsets
B	headsets sorry
C	that's it
B	it's Islam
C	we went we went down and erm we were listening to the we went here we went there and we were listening to what they were saying about different things we were looking at the ceiling and everything and then when we got to the dome went to the dome there was actually a service a communion service so we sat down
B	so you took mass
C	so I took communion what happened was they're all going up and er then it got a few people I said
B	did he erm
C	and then we went down and then we went upstairs to the whispering gallery and that's when I went up to the top
D	er
C	with his back glued to wall
B	scared of heights
C	absolutely
B	very scared of heights
C	I went up all of these extra hundreds of whatever steps came wandered round came back down
D	a hundred and fifty and a hundred and fifty
C	it was so
D	I did two hundred I did two hundred and fifty-nine to get to the
A	and then that was it
D	and the staircase was big and wide
C	it was really wide that's it
D	and I I got and I managed to walk about twenty foot and then sat down and I didn't move
C	he just sort of was like this and it listening to everybody else whispering around and was glued to the thing so
D	right anybody else want a tea or coffee?
C	oh a cup of tea thank you lovely thank you
A	yeah
C	let's imagine
B	not a teacher any more
C	and er isn't she?
B	oh
C	yeah your friend
A	just as a side note
C	didn't she?
A	no
C	well
B	she didn't know who the BNP were she doesn't know you know
C	well I did think of
D	no
C	yeah and then further on was
D	oh yeah
C	lord Horatio Nelson
D	that's
C	and this teacher stood by Horatio Nelson are you listening
B	I'm listening I'm listening yes
C	and she aid and here is the tomb of lord Nelson who was at the battle of Waterloo with Napoleon
D	no she didn't
C	she did she did
D	no no
C	she's
D	she said she asked the children this is Nelson's tomb
C	yes
D	right do you know who Nelson is? and we heard various replies including Nelson Mandela
A	nice
D	and whatever and in the end they didn't they had no idea who it was
D	and she explained about the battle of Waterloo
C	Waterloo
D	and I'm thinking
C	and Nelson was there
D	just a second
C	wrong tomb honey
D	Wellington Wellington's about thirty-five forty foot that way
A	she she wouldn't have a clue
A	she'd probably be like oh that's erm Winston Churchill
A	no she erm my the girls were asking her about Ebola cos I can't really
C	it's so current
A	she was having some sort of like African day or something I don't know and the girls who had been speaking about it had been all over the news she was like what's Ebola? what the hell where have you been?
B	she's a teacher
C	she's a teacher
A	she's teaching the next generation
C	so she would have been the teacher who would have got Nelson and Wellington mixed up
C	dear me did you see did you see The Apprentice?
B	no
A	we don't watch it do we?
C	no well I wasn't going to this series I say that every time but what I like is Dara the show after is so funny

D	he was in a
C	yeah there were family issues as well I think
D	yes
C	but he's so nice
D	I was absolutely absolutely amazed when I found out
C	come out of it really really well
A	we need to do something with
D	how are my chillies?
B	ours are a lot dryer than yours
D	well ours are
C	but your house is something special that's a north facing window and it
B	our house is cold
D	but it's cost me
C	is it?
D	it's cost me twice as much to get them dried as it has in your house
A	it's not really we haven't got the heating or anything on yet
C	good for you
D	I check my bills
A	it was cold this morning though
D	what are we working what did
B	fifty-one days for gas and electricity was fifty-three pounds
D	right so
C	watch the cat watch the cat
D	ninety-three days or something was a hundred and ninety-eight
D	so mine has doubled yours
C	but look at the size of the house the house is a bit
D	but having said that it did include a period of a month when you were still here
C	and grandpa was
D	and grandpa was still here and I've checked my consumption on a whatever basis and it's dropped off to virtually nothing
A	yeah
D	I I should a
A	ours ours would be a lot less if didn't use the dishwasher and still like that
C	yeah
A	well we had to use the dishwasher
C	but we
A	but that's probably our most expensive thing
B	we both have ten-minute showers in the morning
C	well the most expensive item I think we've got
A	somebody leaves stuff on standby
B	yeah you do quite a lot
D	I I forget to set my laptop off
C	but I I think that our freezer is so old it's not efficient but it would be
B	how much are chest freezers then?
C	well that chest freezer must be
D	how much? to buy?
B	yeah they're expensive
D	no it's the running cost
C	it's the running cost it's an old one yeah
B	yeah but how much are they to buy if you were to replace that and buy a new one?
C	I want a I don't want a chest freezer I want another one
B	I'm saying how much is it though?
C	oh it'd be quite a bit
D	it would still take us quite a few years with the differential between
B	I'm just saying how much are they?
C	yeah
D	oh two hundred pounds
B	is that it?
D	well it depends what you wanna get I've no idea
A	it's quite convenient though like the amount of things you can fit in there that you can't fit in a normal freezer
C	I know it is useful isn't it?
D	and all the stuff
A	like
C	yeah
D	yeah and
A	or ice cream ice cream makers
C	have you used yours yet?
B	we can't fit it in can we
A	we'd have to have an empty freezer basically to be able to use it
