B	mm
C	there was just no point at all
B	yeah
A	these these people that viewed the house they're
C	oh the people that viewed the house aren't they guy who came on Saturday morning with his two children and him he hasn't come back and they were with Brooks in
A	yeah
C	so they've not
A	oh I see yeah
B	mm
C	but this other couple that came from
A	was it
B	oh
A	oh right what's got to be updated then?
B	makes you wonder if they find anywhere doesn't it you know? these people are
A	yeah but when people do buy a house I mean they do update it their self because they
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	that's what I meant really you know
A	everyone's set on everyone put the mark on their house don't they?
B	mm
C	yeah you know I'm thinking well I you know I know that a little but needs to be updated like the kitchen I've said that all along haven't I? but I'm not going to do the kitchen
A	well if you do the kitchen they'd probably come along and say they're going to they want it different won't they?
B	yeah
C	you know I don't know and it just kind of and my
B	mm
A	mm
C	apart from you you know
A	yeah
C	but you're buying the house you're buying the garden you're buying
A	what it is yeah
B	yeah
C	what it is
A	yeah
C	you're not buying it cos you haven't to to do anything when you move in
A	well the majority of people know they're going to do something to the house when they move in don't they?
C	yeah
B	and the area is nice and the
A	schools are
C	yeah
A	brilliant schools aren't they right right on top of you
B	yeah it's
A	and and the facilities in a village are fantastic
C	yeah
B	mm mm
C	you know and I just thought you know what is it? yes the outside of the house needs painting
A	yeah
C	but
A	oh right yes
C	right
B	okay
A	now is that accessible easily for for the kitchen? you got to think moving food from one place to the next I mean that's a really handy dining room that is
C	yeah but
A	and you got to go down the corridor
C	well you just got to come out the kitchen down the thing haven't you?
A	yeah
C	you know so it's not that far
B	yeah yeah
A	no that's not far no
C	and put the dining room in where the lounge is
A	yeah
B	mm
C	move the
A	so you're you'd have the lounge and the conservatory wouldn't you?
C	you'd have the dining room and the conservatory
A	yeah you'd have the dining room and the conservatory yeah
B	yeah that that could work actually cos
A	that could work yeah
B	the size of your what your dining room now is kind of more open isn't it? and the other one's quite narrow which a table in there would look quite good wouldn't it? look very good
C	yeah yeah
A	yeah
C	you know
B	yeah
A	and what about the office that come off it?
B	yeah
C	well that's quite handy off the dining room isn't it?
A	yeah yeah
B	mm yeah
C	you know cos these people that walked these people that walked round on Saturday
B	oh right
A	did they?
C	and I'm thinking you can see it's there this is my size sofa
B	yeah
C	that is in there
A	they banged their leg?
C	yeah
A	well that's cos they're looking like that walking through aren't they? they're looking up in the air
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	so if I put that so if I put that in there and put painted the painted the dining room magnolia
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	with the brown sofa
A	yeah
C	settee colours
B	yeah that would
A	yeah that would work wasn't it? yeah
B	alright and then put the telly in the corner of the room
A	yeah
B	mm
C	so you can see it as just needing to be moved round as such
A	yeah yeah
B	you could still have a small table in there anyway if you wanted to couldn't you? if you wanted to go sit there and the formal dining
C	yeah but I'd just keep yeah I'd just keep it like that I could have a small table in the kitchen couldn't I?
A	yeah
B	it's a big lounge isn't it?
A	yeah it is a big lounge
B	I mean it's a lot bigger than this
C	it's probably the same size as this
A	yeah
B	no it's bigger cos you've got you've got a settee haven't you? and a television and you got a table
A	yeah
B	big window huge window
A	yeah
C	so that's what I'm thinking of doing
A	yeah
B	well if you want any help moving anything

[ANNOTATION]	Person C thinks having two separate bath could be positive	Entailment
A	yeah
C	but dunno

A	they get picked up and brought home don't they?
B	and they can still study there
C	yeah
B	and they probably do more studying that's what we found anyway ours did more work there if there's not a television for them
A	yeah
B	erm because then they'd no other distraction

C	so she'll she'll get by on that sandwich sandwich a packet of crisps and a drink
B	mm
C	you know
A	yeah
C	and you think
A	well that ain't no good is it? that's that's that's a bit lazy that isn't it? just having a sandwich
C	now and then like
A	yeah
C	cos
A	no
B	no
A	so
C	yeah well I'll make it for her or then like last week I said well I'm doing steak and chips and egg for tea
A	yeah
C	so I got some steak some ribeye steak and and you know
A	yeah
C	but if say if her mum was to give her the steak no I'm not eating that
A	would she? yeah
C	cos it's never cooked the way it should be cooked you know no
B	no
A	where you going?
A	oh
A	oh dear so it becomes really depressing for you really doesn't it? all the worry about the house and stuff
C	house job everything
A	yeah you haven't thought about looking for a job then
C	I will be looking for a job a different school
A	yeah yeah
C	there's nothing about
A	there isn't
C	if I move if I can move areas there is likely to have something going
A	what about renting you renting your house out then
C	won't cover my mortgage
A	wasn't it?
C	no
A	well your mortgage is only six hundred pound a month innit? no thought it was about two fifty a week innit?
C	eleven hundred
A	eleven hundred a month?
C	well
A	yeah eleven hundred pound a month mortgage are you trying you said you were going to go to phone the society
C	I am so nervous about phoning up
B	are you? what for what they'll say
C	I got the paperwork I got everything there ready to go and I get so nervous about phoning up
A	what because they might say no? well at least you'd know
C	and if they say no what do I do?
A	how long does your mortgage go for? how long is it on for two year?
C	well in three years time I have to pay seventy thousand pound
A	seventy thousand?
B	what's that for?
C	seventy thousand pound
A	why?
C	because that's the endowment side of the mortgage
A	oh you cancelled the endowment didn't you?
C	cos they weren't worth seventy thousand they were only worth twenty thousand
A	that's right yeah cos the write to you and say don't they? yeah
C	but I have I will have that money available
A	because of your pension
C	cos of my pension
A	but you got to survive for three years on what you get in that
B	but why do you have to pay that? I don't understand why you
C	because it's interest only and that was twenty-five years you have to pay it
B	yeah
A	can't you get a lease of life for another ten years?
C	dunno dunno what they can do but if they extend it I've still got to pay it haven't I?
A	well course you have yeah
C	still got to pay it but then that drops then that will drop my mortgage down
A	yeah
C	but it it's getting to that point
A	oh dear
B	have you got a complete budget of expenses for the month and stuff like that?
A	oh he's worked his money out ain't you?
B	yeah there's nothing you can cut down on to just tick over?
A	well you can have beans on toast for a
C	I if I have I have three months
A	what left? moneywise
B	and then and then your expenses re higher than what you're bringing in? mm
A	well surely if you had a chat with the building society and said what it's going to be like in another three years time they could they can at least put another five years on it can't they?
C	yeah but it doesn't change how much I pay each month
A	no I know
B	no
C	all it does is gives them more money
A	yeah
C	that I'm not paying anything off if I could cut if I could cut if I could go interest only until I sell the house I reckon it would drop my mortgage to round about seven hundred six fifty-seven hundred
A	yeah well you can do that
B	and why don't you want to ask them about that?
C	in case they say no
B	but if they say no it's what you're thinking now so
C	so it's that nervy it's that
A	yeah but you're still in the same position
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	but if they say yes that'll lift a great big lump off your shoulders
B	yeah
C	yeah yeah
A	but you're frightened to do it?
C	yeah I mean you know I asked I suppose cos they never got back to me
B	right
A	and they never got back to you?
B	yeah
C	yeah so I mean I've got to do it I know I've got to do it
A	get on the phone now then
C	I don't have all my numbers with me and everything so
A	oh no no
C	but I haven't but I haven't
B	eat the frog
A	eat the frog yeah
C	yeah well I haven't got all my numbers
A	I'll tell you what you could do you could go and live with
B	what with
A	oh yeah you got
C	I know I mean part of me now part of me thinks I should be able to do it
A	yeah
C	but it's all dependent on whether the bank are prepared to actually help me
A	yeah well I mean most they mostly do don't they? they do try and get you out of most things
B	yeah well you you have got the house on the market you're trying to sell so once I mean they know that but it it kind of
A	bite the bullet and get get
B	at least it at least it
C	they know what my salary is each month
B	yeah
C	you know little little like you saying cutting back on things I have cut back on things I don't
B	yeah I no I just just wondered if there's anything else
C	you know I have done one of the things that I could one of the things that I've got to cut back on
A	that's what I was thinking cos that cost you a fortune a month
C	you know I
A	how much is that a month?
C	eighty pound
A	eighty quid a month well that's eighty quid in your pocket then
C	no that's the thing it well yes it is in in theory but no it yes it is in theory but I could probably get in touch with Sky and say look I'm thinking about changing my package what can you do for me et cetera et cetera
A	yeah
C	and just drop that down
A	I mean how much do you watch?
C	it's not me that watches it it's the girls
B	yeah
A	well they got to understand haven't they?
C	you know
B	they're not they're not there too long are they? I bet the watch BBC and ITV more often
C	yeah they don't the thing is they don't have it at their mum's so you know
A	well that's not the point is it you've got to look after your
C	yeah
B	would that that would save about getting on for a thousand pound wouldn't it?
A	they would understand
C	no
B	yeah eighty pound a month
C	eighty well a year I could drop it I could drop it down I could drop it down
A	but keep Sky?
C	I can I can I can still keep
B	I mean we got Freesat and Freeview you can get most of the programmes after a time on them anyway
C	yeah I mean I can I can I think I you know I haven't looked I haven't looked into it so I
B	you've got a contract at the moment haven't you anyway? so mm
C	yeah
A	well I should look into that and save up your pennies
C	yeah Sky Sky are pretty good if you turn round to Sky usually from what my nephew was saying and say we're thinking about going away from you they say of we'd like you to stay so we'll halve it for you
A	yeah? well that'd be half wasn't it?
C	you know
B	mm
A	well just try
C	you know erm
A	you can only but try
C	if they could if I could drop my if I could drop my gas down a little bit
A	yeah
C	cos last year they have me an eight hundred pound rebate
A	yeah?
B	yeah
C	cos that's how much extra I paid throughout the year
B	mm
A	yeah
B	right
C	which is what will happen it won't be so much this year
A	no
C	because they've changed although they've only changed it by thirty pound a month
B	yeah
C	so they've dropped it by thirty pound a month so if you times that by twelve
A	that's three hundred and sixty quid
C	alright? but they gave me a rebate of eight hundred so they could drop that down a bit more
A	yeah
C	they could drop that down so if I could do it down to a hundred a twenty maybe
A	yeah well I you got you got that
C	yeah yeah
A	oh it works well you got that little burner in there that that should that should keep your prices down a bit but I know you need hot water which is what we do that's why we lit the fire this morning just to have hot water but forty gallons don't last very long with a family do it?
C	no
B	no
C	our boiler is efficient you know when I consider how much it has come down it's come down seventy pound a month
A	yeah
C	since having the new boiler put in
B	yeah that's
A	yeah
B	well there you are that's another erm seven hundred a year
A	yeah
C	yeah you know but that's but that's how much it's come down
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	you know but if they if I could say right you know to
A	yeah yeah
C	and if I could cut the Sky down to twenty-five pound a month thirty pound a month
A	yeah yeah or have it for nothing Freeview and
C	yeah I can have BT
A	you can have BT yeah
C	you can have BT
A	but then that's still like
C	don't have to pay for BT
A	don't you?
C	no
A	BT is the same a Sky really innit? they got a few bits and pieces missing
C	I I for the BT football I don't have to pay
A	no
C	but there's certain channels that you can't get that aren't because I have the sports like Eurosports
A	yeah
B	mm
C	unless you have the sports you can't get it
A	no
C	and if you ask just for the Eurosports it's as much to have that as it is to keep
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	the package so
A	but you can't watch a lot of television cos of your job I mean you're out at seven o'clock in the morning you're
C	yeah I don't I mean I don't
A	so there isn't a lot of time you watch telly so most of it is a waste of money
C	you know like you can buy an an adapter and do Netflix for films
A	yeah
C	which is like six pound a month
A	yeah
C	so I just need to go back to Sky and say what's what?
A	well you do yeah but it's doing it I mean
B	yeah
C	you know
A	you you got to do these things otherwise you don't get any benefit from it you're still coughing up and if you can save ten pound a week at least that's ten pound a week you're saving
C	ah forty yeah forty pound a week forty pound a month is ten pound a week
A	yeah
B	it's a lot innit?
A	yeah and it's it's forty quid on that one and then another forty quid on another one
B	another three months mortgage
A	yeah so you'll have to start sorting it all out and doing it it's the only way to move on
C	yeah I should be able to do you know
A	it's the way forward is that
B	if you were if you say you've sold your house and you're going to move wouldn't you have to stop Sky anyway?
A	no Sky can go with you
C	it can go with you
B	does it? just the
A	you just tell em you're moving
B	oh it would just go
A	but then if there isn't a Sky aerial up
C	they can put one up for you for free
A	would they? mm I mean we got a Sky aerial well we got an aerial we can get BT is we wanted to we could get Sky but we didn't want to but we just
C	your BT comes down your phone line
A	yeah mm
C	your BT is cheaper than Sky
A	yeah
C	much cheaper than Sky
B	is it?
C	but you can only have it in one room
A	yeah
B	oh I see
A	well we got no interest in all that
B	no we're luckily we haven't
C	you know having the having the two girls who are with me a lot of the time
A	yeah
C	I know and I know it's about them but you know?
A	yeah but I mean how how often does
A	is she?
C	if you if you were to see what she downloads or what watches and stuff like that
A	does she?
C	see you and if you don't have a certain part of the package you can't download
A	well she'll have to understand that
C	it's all you know it's all
A	it's all relevant you got to be more strict you're too soft you are you're soft say no learn to say no you can't though can you?
C	yeah but I have though that's the thing isn't it? you know
B	once you see
A	it's hard to get rid of yeah
B	yeah if you've never had it like us we don't miss it
A	no
B	no
C	you know
A	yeah
C	you know lot of them are on Freeview so you are you are right in that in that sense
B	mm
A	yeah
C	okay erm
A	I mean that I don't know how we got Freesat how did we get Freesat
B	erm we got it free with
C	comes with your telly
B	yes the television
A	was it with the telly?
C	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	we got Freesat Freeview and then you got all your other BBC ITV and that
B	but we don't actually go on the Freesat do we?
A	we haven't been on Freesat at all well not for yonks because we can't record from it
B	right but I mean it seems to me it's the same same programmes
A	we can only record from Freeview
C	yeah that's because that's because your recorded hasn't got the tuner in for that that's the reason
A	that's right yeah but whatever is on Freesat is more or less on Freeview anyway
B	mm mm
A	so
B	I don't think there's there's anything different
A	we just watch bits that we like to record them and then see em
B	to be honest we can't get through what we do record
A	no we can't
B	and if we didn't now have

A	I would if I was you
C	I need to go I need to go into the building society and I need to go to the bank
A	there you go they ain't far
B	but don't get any more loans
A	whereabouts is your building society
C	well there used to be one in
A	really?
C	yeah
A	oh so where do you get?
C	just phone em up cos it's all part of it's all part of Lloyds TSB group
A	is it? oh right
C	yeah so I've got I've got three months on a loan and then that's finished
A	yeah?
B	right
C	but then I've got twenty months on another one
A	twenty months on another one
B	ah
C	and then I have my credit cards
B	you don't pay interest on that do you?
C	yeah
A	do you? can't you pay them off every month?
B	is that impossible?
A	so we're going to have to have your credit card
C	I haven't used my credit card I can't use my credit card
B	oh right oh dear so that's money that's going out that that you're not getting anything?
A	that's extra money going out they charge an awful lot
C	I can't I can't do anything about it that's one of the reasons why I've gotta sell
B	yeah
C	one of the reasons I've got to sell
B	yeah
C	it it was not in my hands and you know not getting
A	why?
B	don't get down don't you dare get down
C	I don't think I'm any good any more
B	ah all the kids love you don't they? you know they do look at all those cards you got
C	yeah but that's different now it's not it's not the same
A	you know you always get different intake every year
C	yeah I know I just
A	what because she didn't she didn't put you on the shortlist?
C	well no
A	well you know what OBA was all about that was all about cheapness
C	yeah which is the same as what's happening here
A	yeah
C	you know and what or being too old or not following things you know?
A	yeah
C	oh it is difficult to get jobs in
A	yeah
C	it is difficult to get jobs in
A	yeah
C	the OVA not the OVA sorry erm
A	no
C	got no chance because I know the people that run them all
A	yeah
C	and they're not going to even think about employing me
A	oh dear so do they run
C	no but they're getting into the the
A	yeah
C	you know and I don't I'm not good at interviews any more
A	no?
C	I hate interviews
A	what being interviewed?
C	I hate being interviewed all the questions they ask you
B	yeah
C	it's all different now because you know if you don't fit into what they want you go no chance
A	no
C	it's like that your letter didn't say what you were going to do as a head of year no this is what I've done as a head of year what I've done as a pastoral deputy and you can't see through it there's an agenda there sorry
A	yeah
C	the agenda is I'm too expensive if you give me a
A	yeah
C	cos it's not just what they give you as the TLR it's the on costs like what they have to pay for your pension
A	yeah yeah yeah
C	so
A	not good
C	I'm I I feel there is a there is a way that everything could be sorted when it comes to the bank and the building society but the bank and building society now are so tightly regulated
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	because when you put things into a computer if it comes up with a number
A	well it's computers aren't aren't human's are they? they're they're just they're just programmed
B	yeah they are aren't they? yeah
A	they're just programmed and you can't you can't ask them a question and say and give them a reasonable excuse or anything like that because they're just programmed to say yes and no
C	yeah so
A	I mean that's pathetic they way that's done now innit? absolutely pathetic
B	yes it is yeah yeah
A	you can't talk to a human on the phone hardly if you want this number press that if you want this number press that and all you get is all these different numbers to press through
C	yeah yeah I tried to pay my electricity bill and it was after eight o'clock and most automated services run twenty-four seven
A	yeah yeah
B	yes they do don't they?
C	I tried to pay on a on a
B	yeah
C	cos I'd had the reminder to pay it phoned up our offices are open from so and so time to so and so time
B	yeah
C	in the end I set up paying it
A	did you yeah?
C	so I then get a text message on my phone saying an account has just been set up on your account et cetera so got that thing there but then I wasn't then I had to check to see whether I've got the right account number that it was going to
A	oh right yeah
C	because you don't get any feedback
A	no
B	mm yeah
C	you have this reference number which it says reference number then I look again the reference number here was different to the reference number up there by five digits and you're thinking
B	yeah
C	so they're like
A	there there was a programme
B	think she was
A	yeah and it went to a different different account
B	and so the person it was aimed at didn't get it
A	didn't get it
B	and these other people and it's just disappeared almost
A	and it went into these other people's account and they couldn't find it for ages but in the end they did find this this account and because she paid it in this these people thought well we got it
B	yeah they didn't want to return it
A	they didn't want to return it
C	no when I when I put the number in cos it then says who do you want this to pay for type thing which was like Eon
A	yeah
C	right? so I put the account I put Eon and it says don't recognise it
A	oh
B	yeah
C	okay? on the menu of the references you can put in so I put their sort code in and their account number which it tells you to put in
B	yeah
C	on the screen two power companies come up Eon and Powergen
A	did they? oh right
B	oh
C	so Eon and Powergen are the same company
A	yeah
B	oh
C	erm so so I did it and then on the Monday I got home and I I thought well I need to check this cos I was a bit
B	yeah
C	so I checked and the guy says all the all the financial team leave at six o'clock so can you phone later can you phone tomorrow or later in the week?
A	yeah
C	so I then phoned later in the week and I said can I just check to see whether my bill has been paid please
A	yeah
C	gave all the things yes clear no problem at all everything sorted
A	oh great yeah
B	mm there's that worry isn't there?
A	yeah there is there is a worry isn't there?
B	mm
A	and then there's that one where you you say you have to say if they ask you questions you have to say yes and then they go was that yes? and you go yes don't you? you done it loads of time haven't you?
C	yeah
B	yeah I don't understand
A	I don't understand you I'm putting you through to
B	yes no
A	someone else or something else and then it all go click click click and you're on the phone for about well you're on the phone for a long while and if it ain't an 0 eight hundred number you're paying a lot of money aren't you?
C	yeah I phoned someone the other day the number that was on the back of what I was trying to sort out and it was an 0 eight three four five number
A	yeah
C	and it and I was waiting and then it comes in if you phone 0 three four five this is a cheap rate why don't you put that on the back of the thing
A	yeah
B	uh and some 0 eight hundred numbers which we've always thought were free
A	free are not free
B	they're not they're premium rate
A	watch these 0 eight hundred numbers that says cos some of them are premium rate
B	yeah
C	yeah so
A	that's a bit naughty you know premium rate is ninety odd pence a minute
B	very naughty
C	yeah so you just phone them and you're okay and because you can't from a mobile you can't phone free numbers
A	no
C	cos the networks don't allow it
A	no they don't no cos they tell you on the on the on the box if you if you phone in at this number that's gonna cost you three pence a minute but
B	no erm
A	yeah
C	right erm when are you going?
B	Saturday early
A	Saturday morning around about eight o'clock
C	okay well I'll come I'll come and see you on Friday
A	yeah
B	you got a new one to erm meet anyway so we can some'll be all fine
A	yeah well we'll go we'll go about eight o'clock
B	but we will be as early as we can actually
A	eight or nine o'clock I mean we
B	OL we've just got a code to get in
A	cos it's only a four and a half hour journey so we got we we got to get there way before five anyway to
B	oh gosh we will
A	to see ourselves right haven't we?
B	yeah find out what what it looks like
A	and find out our whereabouts where the towels are where this is at and where that's at
B	where the keys are
A	where the keys are and
B	yeah
A	sort the rooms out see if I wonder if we've got to make the beds then
B	no
A	no that's good
B	but we have at Coniston I think
A	have you? oh dear instead of putting the sheets on the bed the the new the clean ones on on the on the bed so that people can come in and make their own bed we got to make the beds now which is gonna take I mean you imagine make doing twenty-six beds or something
C	that's like fifteen minutes a bed
A	yeah
B	yeah about
A	yeah
B	and
A	yeah that's quite a job them mattresses
B	that's quite quite a job
C	it's a lot of
B	cos I've always thought that's really difficult to do in the top bunk
C	yeah
B	to get you got to pull them right over it and put it on but apparently that's how you do them
C	take them off and put them on again
B	put the mattress on
A	but I mean that's a bit of manpower to put a whole mattress up
C	push em off and put em on
A	yeah
B	duvets are quite difficult as well aren't they really?
A	yeah duvets are difficult
B	never mind we'll see how it goes
A	it's time to stop using bunks
B	yes we don't think they should have bunks we that's what we put down didn't we? we don't think they should have bunks any more
A	yeah don't have bunks any more I mean how many married couples want to go and sleep in bunks one above the other it's stupid
B	I know that that erm they'd have to cut down on the numbers of bed but I think bunks have had their time really in the hostels
A	yes
B	they still have bunk houses don't they?
A	yeah they have bunk houses
