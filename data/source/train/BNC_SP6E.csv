B	mm
D	well won't be thinking about it until my foot's better anyway
B	mm
D	erm
B	I mean those crash courses are quite good but the trouble with that is if you don't get the driving experience and then you don't do any driving until you come back
D	yeah
B	you're
D	mm
B	you know cos driving is practise
D	mm
B	it's like riding a bike you know
D	mm

B	right yeah
D	so Monday
B	yeah

B	mm
D	so we could have I mean we had every job interview we had we got offered the job
A	mm lovely
A	mm
B	it's all gotta be eaten
D	mm
A	mm
D	but
A	but there's nothing that you can do about it
D	no que ser√°
B	mm
D	no
B	bit of dressing there
A	mm mm

A	I I didn't even look where it was
B	especially on long journeys
A	yeah but I just wanted to practise
A	you know? So
B	mm
D	is it?
B	that's that's what the benefit is yeah
A	mm
B	it it saves fuel because it will keep the engine going at
D	hmm
A	A steady pace
D	mm
B	yeah
A	mm
D	hmm
A	that's alright you can just
B	whatever you touch if you touch the clutch or the brake
D	it just switches off
A	mm
B	it switches it off
D	oh okay
B	and then you press R resume
D	mm
B	you get back up to speed you press resume and it takes over again
D	oh
B	and if you find you're doing just that little bit too fast
D	yeah
B	and it's like or if you wanna increase slightly you just plus it a little bit
D	mm
C	which for somebody like erm
D	mm
C	it's ideal isn't it
B	that journey he's doing yeah
D	mm
C	and you've only got to go up to sixty-five seventy and your petrol consumption goes whoosh doesn't it
B	you fuel count yeah it doubles yeah
D	mm
A	mm
D	ha
A	yeah I've heard that before
B	mm
C	mm mm
D	hmm
B	oh yeah it's er your right foot controls you're your right
D	hmm mm
C	I'll tell you that next time
B	yeah
B	I used to teach people how to do that on the
D	mm
B	at the
D	hmm
A	mm
B	by maintaining the same speed you could half the fuel consumption
A	mm
D	hmm
B	just by getting up to speed and then take your foot off the
D	hmm
B	not enough to slow the car down but you watch the fuel consumption drop
D	mm
B	yeah it's er it's a clever technique
D	mm
B	mm
A	well we've gotta practise with a four wheel drive for that
D	mm
C	yeah
B	has it gone up?
C	yep
B	I thought or er it hasn't changed

B	yeah
D	hmm
C	like Georgie Best innit?
D	mm
B	that was
A	yeah
B	that's why they are doing that with obesity
D	mm
A	there was a big thing about him wasn't there?
D	mm
B	they do say to people that you know
D	mm
B	it the risk is too great
C	but my ex niece who had a a gastric band fitted it don't look as if it's worked cos she's erm still huge
D	yeah? Really?
A	really?
C	mm
D	hmm
C	mm
D	and she's not eating as much as she was?
C	mm mm
D	hmm
A	that's the  that's the  thing with that there's two types of people that can get obese isn't there?
C	I didn't think they were
B	mm
A	no
D	no
A	no
D	so it's
C	Cos that's what happened to
B	you've probably never saw her cousin
C	she's gone from whoof

C	mm
B	er you know I mean you know it's about as big as it can get
A	but
B	but she's now smaller than trim er thinner than
D	hmm
C	mm
D	hmm
A	but there is two types of people isn't there? There's people that eat an excess just cos they want to
B	mm
C	I think she eats a lot
A	oh
B	yeah
C	but I didn't think she would be able to once she had the gastric band
A	no
B	the western world though obesity is through overindulgence
D	mm
A	mm mm

D	mm
A	yeah
B	oi you're massive
B	what a nice person
A	ah

A	it just slips out the wrong way?
B	yeah she's she's
A	mm
B	she's a very funny woman she is
C	well she says she doesn't but I'm still not sure

D	mm
A	er but I haven't I just can't I haven't no memory for the jokes
D	no
A	no memory at all
B	well
C	and now they've got rid of them
B	her as well
B	and then about it's usually about an hour later isn't it

D	lots of people have said that?
C	but you'll be fine
B	some people say that I've got tomato down my shirt
C	you'll be fine
B	who who died
C	yeah
D	yeah
C	mm
D	make you feel like you've got something in common

B	mm
D	mm
C	well Sally text me yesterday and said that she was watching
D	mm
C	just sort of
D	mm
B	mm
D	but there's something every day isn't there?
C	mm

D	yeah
B	you know that comedian on the telly
D	mm
B	you know he said you know all this homoeopathy?
D	mm mm
B	and all this sort of thing
D	mm it's sugar isn't it

B	and he said all the other stuff he says is mumbo jumbo
D	yeah but there's
A	but a lot of them are placebo
D	yeah
A	mm
B	yeah
A	you know positive thinking
B	mm
A	if you believe that it you know any kind of medicine's going to work then it's gonna help you
D	yeah
B	yeah
D	it's like the big debate at the moment is praying isn't it? Because of this Muamba the guy who had a heart attack on the foot ball pitch
A	mm
B	mm?
D	all these footballers have been saying and tweeting like pray for Muamba
B	mm
D	you know?
A	well they had a big debate
C	well they didn't do that for my cousin who died
D	hmm mm?
C	they didn't do that for my cousin that died
D	yeah exactly
A	yeah they had a big debate about it didn't they
D	well exactly there was a good debate on radio two the other day about prayer
A	or leaving it up to the medicine and the good people at the NHS who were helping
D	yeah
A	it's difficult
B	yeah
C	well I've got some tablets
B	mm
C	and opposite Jarrolds

C	and if I don't take them I'm usually awake about six o'clock ain't I?
B	mm mm
C	half past five
A	mm mm
D	mm
C	so is that?
D	yeah it is psychological
B	psychological
D	mm

C	well it's everybody's everybody's own belief
D	mm
C	some
D	mm
A	mm
C	and it helps them
D	mm
C	I don't believe that my mum is in for instance or my relations are in that grave

C	if they grass it over
D	mm
C	I believe that my mum is here
D	mm
C	with me all the time
D	yeah
A	mm
C	constantly
D	mm
C	but some people do
A	mm
C	you know it's the same as belief in God
D	mm
C	but I wouldn't spout it off

A	mm
B	I think religion
D	mm
B	you know
D	it's just energy isn't it

D	no one can afford to buy a house
B	when we were in Calgary I couldn't believe it
D	hmm
B	have you seen their caravans? Aren't they they put them on the back of vans

D	yeah
B	it's like footballers' wages innit

B	they might live in their house you know the mansion that belongs to the football club
D	mm
B	so you know although they you know they don't give that a money pre-value
