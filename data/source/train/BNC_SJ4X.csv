C	mm hm
B	invariably they were one man
C	hmm
B	companies or two people partners working there or three working together
C	mm hm
B	these sort of people

B	oh yes
C	yeah?
B	oh yes  Oh yes  I it's amazing how much you learn and I'm still learning
C	mm hm
B	about what goes on in the jewellery quarter
C	mm hm
B	I've just a recent date designed jewellery design which is I thought
C	mm hm
B	when you look at a ring on your finger
C	mm hm
B	or a necklace or a bracelet or whatever
C	yeah
B	and I've come across two designers of recent months
C	mm hm
B	incredible work  incredible work  that they've done and done for me personally
C	mm hm
B	on behalf for a client and when I've shown their design to other people they've been absolutely staggered
C	mm hm
B	which I have done and they were gobsmacked
C	wow and is this kind of modern design or traditional?
B	oh yes  Oh yes  modern and traditional
C	mm hm
B	modern and traditional
C	so how is it that you're coming into contact with people are you still
B	through ask
C	running your business?
B	I know a man who knows a man who knows a man
C	oh right
B	and you ask around
C	uh huh
B	this is the way that contacts are made
C	but are you still um up in business?
B	oh yes
C	oh really?
B	in the antiques
C	yeah
B	antiques and dealing side
C	uh huh
B	oh yes
C	ah
B	yeah it's like a drug
C	really?
B	you never leave it alone
C	uh huh
B	you can't
B	yes
C	mm hm
B	Cos it's no longer it's no
C	mm hm
B	it's not a nine till five job
C	sounds lovely though if you you're lucky enough to find something that you enjoy that much and it pays you
B	well even last week um which was quite sort of strange the way that happened
C	ah the Citizens?
B	as an advisor
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	It's an 8 hour job.	Contradiction
B	and uh made a number of friends naturally
C	mm hm
B	that she wanted valuing for sale and she was going to go to Bonham's
C	mm hm
B	the auctioneers and unfortunately the person who she was going to go to was coming up from London and had had a breakdown on the car breakdown on the motorway
C	mm hm
B	and couldn't make it
C	hmm
B	so you know it was just coincidental
C	mm hm
[ANNOTATION]	She was coming all the way from Stockholm.	Contradiction
B	within a matter of four or five hours within the first phone call they were here
A	oh yes I
C	mm hm
A	as well so yeah oh yes
B	she's got quite a lot
C	there's some good stories behind some of the pieces no?
B	well when they
C	antiques
[ANNOTATION]	She got a lot of good stories.	Entailment
B	when they come to going back when I was doing
C	mm hm
B	if I saw something I liked the look of or if I was doing some house clearance
C	mm hm
B	and I found something or someone has come to me and I'd bought the item from uh showed it to
C	lucky very lucky
A	yes that's right  that's right
B	going back I think one of the no I think the first present that I bought you were those little rose earrings little rose gold earrings remember?
A	I've still got them
A	with the birds on
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B bought the earrings from Tiffany's.	Neutral
C	aw
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker C is sighing.	Entailment
B	yes with the birds on and that was one of the first presents
C	uh huh
B	in this but other items that cameo that I bought off of what was her name? Up the road
A	but they've come and gone I mean it's sort of sometimes that I got rid of things and had other things and this sort of thing so yeah
C	I've got this this ring has got a bit of a story
B	yeah
C	it was my great aunt's
B	I think I've seen it
[ANNOTATION]	The ring that they're talking about has a long story.	Entailment
C	have you?
B	I think your mum showed it to me
C	oh really?
B	take it off
C	yeah can you tell me what information it has got on the back? Because it's got a number that looks like nineteen twenty-eight or something but I don't know whether that's the year
B	let me go and get my spy glasses
C	oh okay alright then
B	here we go
C	but um my great aunt
C	she must have lent it to her and she obviously forgot to give it back and then to the extent where she actually thought it was her own ring
C	but um my nan said that uh when she'd be working in
A	oh heck
C	yes it's really sad and she's got this ring and she didn't know whether to keep it or then when she met my nan she said why don't you have it? I'd like for someone to wear it
A	it's got quite a history
C	yeah it's got a story behind it it's quite a sad story but in a way it's nice that you know the story is being told and is something to remember them by but
B	it's eighteen carat gold
C	oh
B	the shank
C	uh huh
B	yeah
C	how do you know that what?
B	it's got eighteen CT on it
C	ah okay
B	and also this ring has been made larger
C	uh huh
B	originally it was smaller
C	ah
B	than it is
C	ah
B	and there's been a little section placed in there to make it just that little bit larger
C	hmm
B	and it's a diamond set in platinum
C	okay and so this this um
B	that mark
C	mm hm
B	is eighteen CT
C	mm hm
B	cT
A	eighteen carat gold
C	ah okay
B	eighteen carat gold
C	Cos it looks like it's nineteen you see that that there
B	that's an eight not a nine
C	ah
C	oh
B	hello? Hello?
B	if you come over to the back
C	I'm happy
A	hello
B	can you? Should I hold the mic? Now rest
B	alright bye
B	your thumb
C	mm hm
B	on your nose
C	mm hm
B	and hold that in front of you eye
C	okay
B	and bring it into focus
C	oh my nails are dirty
B	no it's it's one eight C T
C	is that the right  is that the right  way up? Is that the way that you've been looking at it?
B	let's have a look
C	was I looking at it the wrong way up?
B	yeah
C	upside down
B	you see it's been
C	uh huh
B	I can assure you
C	okay and what's the other?
B	in the little square block
C	ah
B	oblong block
C	yeah
B	one eight C T
C	so what's the what is the it's embossed with four figures next to the little box
B	that's got nineteen seventeen
C	yeah so that's what I was that's what I could see with my naked eye
B	yes
C	and I was thinking
B	that's nineteen seventeen
C	so it doesn't that means
B	that's
C	really? So it's that old? Blimey
B	yes
C	but I was looking at the date
B	but in the trade um the trade description of that hallmark would be a foreigner
C	mm hm
B	because it is not the full hallmark that you could get
C	what would a full hallmark be?
B	A
C	mm hm
B	then they'd be seven five O
C	mm hm
B	Seven fifty
C	mm hm
B	is three eighths
C	mm hm
B	the point three seven five in decimals is three eighths
C	mm hm
B	which is three quarters
C	mm hm
B	of
C	ah okay
B	it's mixed with any other metal that might be available usually copper
C	uh huh
B	if it's red gold it's copper
C	hmm do you think that would be brass then?
B	that would be with brass then yes
C	okay
B	A mixture
C	how interesting
B	Cos
C	uh huh
B	twenty-four carat gold is too soft
C	right well in five years' time I'm going to have to celebrate the centenary of this ring aren't I?
B	yes
A	party
B	yes
C	how interesting
B	can you pass this passed down to your from your aunt?
C	it was my great aunt
B	yeah
C	who nicked it off her sister my nan
B	yeah
C	and she was given it was given to her by a woman she worked with in the hospital in the nineteen sixties and this ring had been bought as an engagement ring second hand
B	yup
C	by her daughter in the nineteen forties
B	yeah
C	so I guess that stands to reason doesn't it?
C	mm hm
B	but didn't want to send it to be fully hallmarked
C	oh okay
B	so because of the cost
C	oh cos it costs more money to get it hallmarked?
B	of course and you'll get the difference if you get platinum
C	uh huh
B	P L A T
C	uh huh
B	which is a pure metal
C	okay
B	yes yes
C	and
B	yes
C	he makes amazing amazing pieces
B	oh yes
C	intricate and um
B	yes the uh the the skill
C	mm hm
B	the skills
C	mm hm
B	and the way that they work
C	mm hm
B	to
C	yeah
B	it's very very fine work
C	and it's also repetitive as well
B	yes
C	and they can recreate
B	the engraving
C	every single
B	the cutting and
C	yeah
B	yes
C	I'm sure that there's a professional word for them
B	oh yes  oh yes right
C	but he ran his own business and I think in that world it's very a bit dodgy and he ended up um pretty much becoming destitute just because he wouldn't  he wouldn't  act in a um
B	an immoral or illegal way
C	there we go
B	yeah
C	thank you very much for finishing my sentence
B	he was Asian
C	yes
B	well it's um without sort of eh being critical or racist um it's it can be a very very tight
C	hmm
B	community sort of set up
C	yeah
B	and you don't step out of line
C	yeah but I think basically also the the fact that he was making the jewellery pieces mostly for dowries and there's so much passion and uh
B	oh yes  Oh yes
C	pride and
C	status involved in that
B	yes
C	mm hm
B	the
C	mm hm
B	and you see what they have in their windows um remarkable work
C	mm hm
B	remarkable work
C	yeah
B	they don't work legally
C	mm hm
B	and that's a big can be a big problem
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	and he had to pay back a lot of people and because people didn't understand his situation they started becoming extremely violent and
B	really?
C	they had to keep moving house and so he kept hiding little
B	yes
C	bags of gold around
B	it's like a mafia arrangement
A	well they did demolish some of the things in the jewellery quarter
C	uh huh
A	and they found these gold
B	oh yeah
A	sweepings
C	ah
A	well they just when you're working
C	uh huh
A	it drops down and everything
B	when they um there is a large multi storey uh establishment in the jewellery quarter
C	mm hm
B	opposite the clock
C	yeah
B	this clock that's in the centre
C	yeah
C	mm hm
B	all that area was small manufacturing jewellers
C	mm hm
[ANNOTATION]	the jewelers made rings	Neutral
B	now if you think about the way that jewellery is made uh to make it more fine they have to file it and polish it
C	mm hm
B	and the residues  the residues  of the gold as Pat has said dropped cos they work on a bench
C	mm hm
B	and all of the residue of the cuttings et cetera would be going on the bench but some would fall through  fall through  into the wood
C	ah okay
B	of the floorboards
C	uh huh
[ANNOTATION]	some gold was left in the floorboards	Entailment
B	and over the many many many years the residue in these wooden floors and when they demolished that particular area the rumour went round that the demolition teams that went in realised what there was in the floorboards and underneath the floor boards as I said and there were literally the value of thousands and thousands and thousands of pounds
C	wow
B	because they burnt
C	mm hm
B	the timber
C	mm hm
B	and the gold residue
C	ah okay
[ANNOTATION]	the residue gold worths lots of money	Entailment
B	and they found thousands and thousands of pounds worth
C	wow
B	yes
B	gold rush
A	yes
C	had it come embedded in the grain or?
B	yes
C	wow
[ANNOTATION]	the residue gold was worthless	Contradiction
C	mm hm
B	and the workers on the benches women and men who worked on the benches the artisans worked on the benches had to change their clothing and their shoes
C	mm hm
B	when they were working and then when they finished work they changed into their outdoor so that their clothes the dust the gold dust
C	uh huh
B	and filings were not accumulated on their clothes
C	ah
B	yes
[ANNOTATION]	workers wear the same clothes during and after work	Contradiction
C	powder on
B	oh yes
C	is that valuable?
C	mm hm
B	um if you think about powder when you put powder on your face
C	mm hm
B	or you use washing powder or something like that the fine particles that are in the air the dust if you look around
C	mm hm
B	because we are all losing skin
C	mm hm
B	follicles which is dust which you possibly know about
C	mm hm
B	or are aware about and this is
C	it's interesting isn't it when you think about it?
B	this is all accumulated
C	uh huh
B	the term in the trade the antique trade as far as dust is concerned
C	uh huh
B	dust
C	oh
B	oh yes
C	oh right
B	yes
C	and you can eat it?
B	oh yes
A	oh yes it's edible
B	it's it's
C	uh huh
B	because gold and silver
B	yeah is that
B	you can if you can appreciate a cigarette paper thickness
C	oh right
B	gold leaf
C	uh huh
B	now I'm not saying that that picture frame in particular but there are picture frames that are made were made in the olden times which had a gold leaf
C	hmm okay
B	laid on them and the people who did put this gold leaf on
C	mm hm
B	were very very skilled workers and the gold leaf used to come in sheet form
C	mm hm
B	in a box and to pick up this gold leaf to lay it on a frame they used a paint brush
C	mm hm
B	the walls et cetera but a paint brush to paint pictures and things and they picked it up on a paint brush it was that fine
C	oh wow
B	or you couldn't handle it otherwise
C	oh
A	and they use it to decorate cakes? I mean you can have celebratory cakes with gold leaves on them
C	uh huh
B	oh yes
C	that must cost a bomb
A	yes but it's not very heavy
A	not great slices of it
C	the price of gold has gone up hasn't it?
B	oh tremendously
C	yes
B	well it's fluctuating now in between it's it's um over the past three years
C	alright
B	it's nearly seventeen at the
C	mm hm
B	and three or four years ago it was four hundred five hundred dollars
C	so why has it shot up? Is it
B	demand
A	because of the financial situation
C	really?
A	yup
C	mm hm
A	it's still there
C	that's interesting
B	when I first came into the antique business
C	mm hm
B	and bought my shop in nineteen seventy-one a dealing et cetera
C	mm hm
B	how much do you think a sovereign is now today?
C	oh I don't know
B	just under four hundred pounds
C	oh? Really? Gosh
B	I was able to buy Kruger Rands  Kruger Rands  which is an ounce
C	mm
B	so t's the same well it's the South African gold called called a Kruger Rand which is one ounce of twenty-two carat gold
C	mm hm
B	very nearly pure gold
C	hmm
B	now they're nearly a thousand pounds or a little bit over a thousand pounds
C	it has shot up hasn't it? I think one of the  one of the  consequences of the price of gold shooting up was that there were a lot of um burglaries targeted to Indian families in the area
A	that's right because they know that the all these women have would have had all this jewellery
C	yeah
A	um
B	yes
C	mm hm
B	bracelets bracelets and bangles
A	yes bracelets bangles
C	it's part of the dowry isn't it?
A	yes it is
B	oh yes
C	and it's all got different uh tradition and significance but I think er the lady over the road was it Seema?
A	yeah
B	yes
C	the lady over the road
A	oh they had problems yes
C	last year
B	yes
C	which was probably that
A	they are targeted there's no doubt about it
C	mm hm
A	and um not practising or anything
C	oh right
A	on her
C	hmm
A	that's another thing you see they have it and don't insure it
C	oh well I think I remember that they said that the sixteen year old he was there
A	he was there doing his homework
C	oh poor thing
A	yeah
C	awful
A	that's why the burglar
C	mm hm
A	it's not bad
B	considering yes
C	hmm
B	it's
C	mm hm
B	area
C	I was surprised I've
B	I think what people
C	particular area
B	because it's
A	it's near the shops so you've got a lot of traffic
B	traffic
C	ah
A	going past people going past
B	yes the assessors
A	and they if you've got a garden that's enclosed
C	mm hm
A	as this is you see
C	uh huh
A	that's what they like
C	okay
B	High fences
C	right
A	and and they would have to come over other people's gardens you see
C	yeah
A	so they do like that and they do like uh things you know where people are constantly passing
C	yeah
A	well they may have done
C	from the alley way
A	well I don't know
C	oh yeah that's right
A	yeah they did get
C	that's right
A	they did get over but couldn't couldn't couldn't get into the house
C	hmm and dad was saying that they tried to steal all the the lead off the the insulation on the top of the the passageway
A	yeah
C	maybe they just couldn't get into the house
A	no they couldn't and I mean if it's they brought they brought they've got to be able to get away you see
C	mm hm
A	this is the thing this is what they look to see that
B	one of the first things didn't this police the policeman that came to
C	yeah
B	if he can get away quickly
C	mm hm
B	it's getting out and if they can get out quickly this is what they look for
C	yeah
B	and get away
C	huh that's good to know
B	we'll we've I think we've had it we've been here now how many years? Thirty?
A	we came here in seventy-six
B	they had a burglary
A	they had they got in through the kitchen window
B	they were because that was
A	but I don't think they got window locks
B	no
A	I mean that was in
B	but when we moved in
C	mm hm
B	that's cos we'd had a burglary in the flat
B	and we put in
C	hmm
B	all the way round and things like that and locks on the windows and things like that
C	mm hm
B	so we were very very conscious because where we lived in Edgbaston we were burgled
C	really?
B	we had a flat and we were burgled weren't we?
A	hmm
B	and we were on the second floor? Third floor?
A	second
B	second floor
C	mm hm
B	so we were conscious of this and did something about it
C	hmm
C	Cos
B	sure
C	when you're on the sixth or seventh floor there's only one access
A	that's right
C	and that's the stairs and
A	that's right
C	you feel a bit safer because there's only one point of entry as well the front door
B	hmm
A	mm hm
C	and all of a sudden there's like
C	front door back door side door
A	Windows
B	we're very very conscious of insurance as well of property and insurance of contents
C	mm hm
B	are one of the things the assessor came and asked us about was a burglar alarm
C	mm hm
B	and we'd told him we'd had the uh crime prevention policeman
C	mm hm
B	officer come and see it and he looked around and he asked us about it and said one of the reasons that people have a burglar alarm is invariably they've got something worth stealing
C	ah
B	hanging outside of the house
C	okay
A	and
B	the burglar will go past
A	and also when we moved in of course nobody had a burglar alarm
C	uh huh
A	in this road um and they said don't put a
B	oh yeah
A	this is the police don't put a burglar alarm because this is true you see they see a burglar alarm and think ah that's worth it
C	hmm
A	but now of course that we're probably the only people on the road who haven't got one
C	well if you think about all the things that are in a house nowadays everyone's got well flat screen TVs iPods iPads ipiddles ipoodles
B	hmm
C	all these expensive gadgets
B	some things that are easily disposable of down the
C	yeah
B	yup
A	yeah oh Yes
B	yup
C	mm hm
B	yup
C	where was your shop?
B	in um
C	oh yeah
B	um do you know The College Arms?
C	mm hm
B	at the bottom of um
C	mm hm
B	to assess um uh uh following the robbery and the this couple who I knew and they rang me and I went over cos I lived in over
C	mm hm
B	in their house and they went away for a
C	oh no
B	is they'd come in over the back and taken out the patio doors
C	oh gosh
B	and they'd actually taken the patio doors out and left them on the lawn and taken everything out
A	and
B	yup
A	to just load this van up
C	cheeky things
A	so you I mean most burglars I suppose are sort of opportunist ones
C	hmm
A	the window opening and whatever
C	hmm
A	but of course it's the
C	mm hm
A	what's around so
C	case the joint before they
A	yeah absolutely
C	plan it
A	there's no such thing as a hundred percent protection
C	no there isn't
B	what did that policeman say the other that came to see us about some they're what did they call? Opportunists?
C	mm hm
A	yeah that's what I said they're opportunists
B	yeah
A	they see a window open
C	mm hm
A	or or whatever and um in they go in and out quickly though
C	there was a spate of uh burglaries in Spain in big villas you know most people live in apartment buildings but people who do live in houses are usually the tourists who've got enough money to buy a house or very rich families and so what um they found that after was it it was a couple of years ago about five years ago when um other countries were let into the EEC like Romania and
B	when the Eastern European countries came?
C	yeah that's right
B	yeah
C	and all of a sudden there was an influx of
B	albanians
C	yeah for example
C	well apparently it was all the um the police  the police  from countries like that that were forming organised crime groups
B	yes
C	obviously they had all the expertise
B	crime group
C	and it was uh were doing these burglaries whereby they got they opened the letter box and gassed the the house so that if you were in the house you'd get knocked out and they'd come in break forced entry steal everything knowing that you couldn't do anything about it because you wouldn't even be aware of it because you'd be um
B	knocked out
C	yeah
B	Good heavens
C	and well at least there was no violence involved
A	oh no
C	everything's gone and people have been in your house and
B	of course one of the things of course is having a a a table or something or rather in your entrance and that people can look through the letter box and hook the keys out
C	ah
A	oh yes
B	if anything in a it should be in a drawer
C	yup
B	in a drawer which is shut
C	or they get
B	which is usually locked
C	or they can get in through cat flaps as well
B	oh yes
A	oh yeah little burglars
C	or at least not maybe get through but get little you know
B	yeah
C	they've got sticks with grabbers on
A	oh yeah that's right
B	we have to speak of nicer things more pleasant things
B	haven't organised anything with
C	mm hm
B	but I'm seeing
C	okay super
B	so the week after not next week cos the on the twenty-fifth we're going out we're taking the family out
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	hmm
B	before
C	yeah
B	well
C	Cos it might be a nice
C	uh-huh
B	so as a result of this it's more going to be his dad
C	mm hm
B	who was
C	hmm
B	my nephew who was more involved
C	okay
B	and
C	okay
B	so it's them that I'm going to sort of sort things out with
C	mm hm
B	for my sister in America
C	mm hm
B	so that I can do this for my sister in America
C	mm hm
B	uh would appreciate it so much
C	right so the photo book is just for your sister in America?
B	in America yes
C	what's her name?
C	ah
B	or
C	mm hm
B	but she likes the name
B	and
C	and so you've got  you've got  the photos that dad took?
B	yup
C	you're happy with those?
B	very very much though
C	he's got quite a good eye doesn't he?
B	then I don't know what  I don't know what  it is your your dad was there snapping away  snapping away  it must be sixty or seventy photographs I would think
C	mm hm
B	I haven't counted them
C	yeah
B	invariably and you think who's not on but
C	yeah I was  I was  the paparazzi for my nan's ninetieth
B	birthday
A	yeah we were there
C	um and um one of her colleagues her ex colleagues from work was apparently extremely distressed because out of all the photos I took she wasn't on one of them
B	yes
C	I was  I was  like I'm sorry
B	yeah yeah
C	I'm really sorry
B	this
C	there were like fifty people there
B	this issue happens at weddings isn't it?
A	people move around
B	yes
A	they moved when she photographed them at one table and then you waited and they move about
C	mm hm
A	you see? So you've been to that table but they aren't on it
C	mm hm
A	because they then go to that table
B	wedding photo's
C	well the worst was that they had a coffee morning all the ex colleagues that used to work together at the hospital and I think there's about eight of them all ladies that have coffee together
B	hmm
C	and my nan said oh I want a photo with the ladies
B	oh dear
C	she said she missed me off the photo
B	oh dear
C	what do you mean I missed you off?
B	yes yes
C	well you
B	and then get very touched
C	yeah but she wasn't even there
B	yes
C	like you know when you've missed someone off it's because the viewfinder's too small or something
B	yeah
C	but she wasn't even there
B	or sometimes when you dp a group photograph
C	yeah
B	and they're taller
C	crazy
B	very difficult but they're very good
C	aw super
B	Great excellent
C	mm hm
B	the photographs with
C	mm hm
B	in particular and
C	yeah sure
B	because there's a couple that I'd like of that your dad didn't take
C	uh huh
B	that I've got separate
C	yeah
B	of
C	are they on paper?
B	uh
C	photos?
B	well I had them blown up
C	okay
B	but they're larger
C	uh huh
B	like I said I want those
C	well what we can do is that we can scan those into the computer so it doesn't really matter what size they are
B	yeah
C	and then turn them into a digital document that we can then
B	sure
C	I think what you could be getting you could be having a think about um is which of the photos or which of the cos you said you wanted to put some of the cards that you received?
B	yes
C	uh huh
B	that I've received
C	so
B	yeah
C	for example that's an A4 page and that's an A4 page
B	yeah
C	you could  you could  fit like for example two photos on one A4 page
B	yes
C	or have one
B	yeah
C	in portrait on a whole A4 page
B	yeah
C	so if they're any particularly special ones
B	yup
C	you could either or even have like double page
B	sure
C	spread of it if it's in landscape
B	this is something that I really enjoyed because of your knowledge and expertise particularly the one that you did I think that was absolutely super
C	aw
B	so in that respect you know
C	mm hm
B	how are we gonna compile this?
C	but if you choose the the photos that are really special to you
B	sure
C	and that you like bigger
B	sure
C	as a double page spread or as a
B	yeah
A	there quite the right size
C	yeah
A	that would have to be included in this
C	yeah
A	because there's a lot of the others they don't know
C	but if you wanted if there's a particularly favourite photo of
B	there are two
C	oh of course yeah because is that the ones that you have on
B	yeah
C	at the front and
B	there's one  There's one  that we had at the front of the order of service
C	mm hm
B	which you've seen
C	mm hm
B	because have you seen the one?
C	yeah
B	on the order of service
C	uh huh
B	which is her looking sideways
C	mm hm
B	but it's a very good photo of her taken quite recently this was
C	uh huh
B	I think it was last year with
A	hmm
B	uh so we cut that in half and that's gone on in the order of service but there's two other photographs one when she was involved with a um a
A	with open Christmas
B	an open Christmas which was for the down and outs and destitutes
C	mm hm
B	in the seventies and she was one of the first people who formed this group
C	hmm
A	they still do you know Saint Martin in the field this Christmas thing
C	mm hm
A	it's still open Christmas
B	it's still going? Open Christmas
A	and she did was involved in the
C	mm hm
A	um people would that are poor and
C	mm hm
A	and they they turned up you know and stayed over Christmas in Saint Basil's or something wasn't it? Anyway so and she was involved with that right from the start and then there's a photograph of her in the newspaper cos it she had a write up in the newspaper
C	mm hm
A	so um
B	which I kept
C	hmm
A	of course you don't throw anything away
A	we should we could be found dead under piles of paper
C	well if you want to put the newspaper thing in as well we can scan that in
B	yes
C	into the computer
B	yes
C	that could be a good idea
B	yeah I'm I'm sure that
C	mm hm
B	so in age she was closer to
C	mm hm
B	because I'll show you what I mean
C	have you got brother and sisters
A	I've got two sisters
C	yeah? Where are they?
A	one is in
C	ah
A	and the other one lives in the
C	okay
B	so yes
C	aw a beautiful photo
B	that's
C	uh huh
B	and that's
C	uh huh
B	and that's my older sister
A	A couple of years ago I think
B	three four years ago
A	and that sulky little
B	and that's me
A	boy is
C	aw
A	about four
B	about four
A	weren't you? Yeah
C	what a lovely picture
C	mm hm
B	they shared a bed that's when all the family were at home
C	mm hm
B	I would
A	he has to go through them actually
C	yeah
A	there's still all together
B	but
A	sorted I've sorted a few
C	yeah
B	no
A	no
A	that's right
C	are you and are you thinking of an A4 sized book like the one in my parents' house?
B	yes like the one
C	because I found I think the A4 ones you have to have a certain number of pages and I actually found that it was difficult to fill that amount of pages with all the photos
B	well we this is something that we can sort out
C	yeah
B	we we well you know we'll be quite flexible is how
C	mm hm
B	how we're going to go about this
C	how is her eyesight?
C	yeah
B	reasonable
C	okay
B	reasonable
C	Cos I was thinking if her eyesight isn't that good we could do all of the photos on a single page
B	well we can sort that out
C	mm hm
B	her writing is is incredible when she writes
C	mm hm
B	she
A	you'll have to go through the photographs
B	oh yes
A	and sort out what you which one's you want
B	this is what I'm gonna do with
C	yeah
A	yes of course
B	five
C	mm hm
B	and she met
C	mm hm
B	um and also I want I wanted um
A	hmm
B	and now my my nephew
A	well you'll just have to go through them
B	my nephew nephew's from the north
C	mm hm
B	they came as well and my nephew's ex-wife she came with her husband and um
A	she wasn't in any of the photographs except hidden behind somebody's head
B	we haven't told her
A	she's the one that that we said she's
C	she was the one that got away
B	if I would judge um I haven't counted the ones but I would judge we're looking at in between twenty and thirty photographs
A	I doubt it
B	out of them
A	you're picking these numbers out of the air
B	well
A	made a start
B	well I will  I will  go through them
C	hmm
B	I will go through them
C	there might be an idea in that case
