A	but apparently these sort of type bird scarers was just
B	oh right
A	and you sort of like
B	oh crikey yeah

B	oh
B	well he would do yeah
A	and er
A	oh god and then he got he you know he went home and sort of found out all this stuff printed it off and and er
B	oh right

B	did he?
A	yeah he's sort of one of these guys
C	is that strong enough?
A	yeah that's alright
C	okay
A	he's sort of one of these farmers who
B	yeah
A	you know no one tells him to do anything he owns that land and his family's been there for
B	hundred and fifty years yeah
A	you know ten ten generations and you know he does what he does and no ones gonna stop him and
B	yeah
A	brutal
B	yeah
A	farmer type bloke
B	yeah I know the sort
A	and er a real nasty type right? and er
B	oh god
A	you know and then cos you're really he's sort of like
B	wow
A	and things et cetera et cetera er
B	yeah
B	oh dear
B	yeah
A	determined to you know like beat them down
B	well yeah
A	you know it's like
B	yeah
A	this confrontation and that
B	yeah
A	all down the bottom there
B	that's right yeah
A	er you know it just
C	mm
A	makes you feel bad
B	yeah
A	just in case you go down there
C	yeah
A	and they're gonna start up
B	and and yeah
A	you know
B	that's it yeah
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	you know these people are just bullies aren't they?
B	they are yeah
C	mm
A	and er mind you
B	passive
A	well no being so
B	well you
A	you know and if this guy's just planted
B	yeah
A	and the pigeons were eating it all off
B	yeah of course he is
C	mm
B	yeah as long as that's a I don't think er I think they've gotta be about
A	mm well that's right I mean he should have had them in the middle of the field but he just had these
B	yeah
A	chickens
A	cos I
B	yeah
A	cos I mean you can't buy thunder flashes any more you could have a lot of fun with them
B	you could
B	ah well
C	mm
A	but anyway that was
B	so he don't go down his woods any more?
A	well he's been down there since but he er he didn't see anyone so
C	mm
B	no
A	and er I don't suppose he's don't suppose this farmer's got over it now
B	yeah
A	it would just be a bit unlucky
B	well the point is I mean when you get
A	mm
B	and you're wound up you shouldn't go
A	no
B	should you?
A	no
B	there there are ways to negotiate aren't there?
A	but
B	yeah I was saying
A	he's like he
C	it is hard sometimes though isn't it? when you're
B	yeah but
A	yeah
C	when you get like that
B	you don't lose your temper straight away
A	well he
C	mm
A	anyone who questions him
B	yeah I know about that too
A	yeah well I mean there was a er
A	you know like this and er he was crouched in this hedge
A	looking at er
B	the peewits or something
A	stone-curlews
B	stone-curlews
A	stone-curlews that's right
B	yeah right
A	and er while he was there
B	yeah
A	you know and screeched to a halt and shouted out oi what are you doing there to him
A	so
B	I bet he did yeah
B	and someone was poking
A	and
C	yeah
A	someone dressed in camouflage gear was hiding in a hedge
A	with the binoculars out
A	you'd wanna know what they were doing wouldn't you?
B	of course you would
C	you would
A	because these people are
C	it's suspicious isn't it?
A	forever getting stuff nicked
C	yeah
A	by pikeys and that
B	they are ain't they yeah
A	aren't they?
B	yeah of course they are
A	and they anyone could have been out there
C	yeah
A	sussing out
B	well sometimes we get the
A	well it's just that this bloke
C	mm
A	he was a bit abrupt you know and
B	yeah
A	like sort of like and shouted out the window rather than getting out and walking up to him
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	which you know would have been the polite thing
B	yeah
A	well and also this four-by-four had sort of scared away these
B	all the birds
C	yeah
A	all all these stone-curlews which
B	but
A	but you know he thinks he's got the sole
B	you have to think about other people too don't you?
A	he thinks he's got the sole right to go sort of poking about and
A	but that amused me that did
C	yeah
C	mm
B	I know
A	he has
B	I don't know why
A	I don't know why
B	but he's always sort of been er
A	yeah
B	he can
A	he's a bit sort of brittle ain't he?
B	yeah yeah
C	mm
B	well he told me he was gonna come and sort me out once
B	oh christ
A	well that's right it's right he sort of er
B	oh
C	oh dear
A	you know
C	bet that didn't go down well
A	no it didn't he he sort of really sort of
B	but he can't take it can he?
A	no
B	he can't take anything like that
A	no he can't
B	and I said something about
A	mm
B	that upset him
A	yeah
B	but he said do you
A	well that's right but he see you're not the only one that like this person had said something about
A	or something like that
C	oh no
A	and he took great offence at that
B	just having a few
A	just just having a bit of banter
B	yeah
C	mm
B	what it was he he probably told you did he? I don't know what it was I said about
A	no he didn't actually say specifically
B	there was nothing there
A	he just said something like oh bloody

A	ease the
B	ease the pain
A	yeah
B	he was going through
B	cos he was going on about
A	yeah
B	and I said oh well you know something like you know you'll get over it or something silly like that
A	mm
B	and he said oh wouldn't mind to come round and punch you

C	yeah
A	well why does that worry you?
B	yeah
A	you know you'll be dead

B	yeah
A	it does sound horrible
A	but it's just it's the same with
C	yeah
B	but he hasn't made friends has he?
A	but he
C	mm
A	then you know you sort of think well bloody hell

A	mm
B	we'd better go
C	well we only went to leave the present
A	yeah
C	outside that was all
B	so we left him a present and that was it
C	mm
B	so we knew he was in the shower well who'd want to get out of the shower and not cos
C	not really convenient
A	that's right
C	either
A	but he he weren't happy about that
C	oh dear
A	but then you know you can't
C	we thought we were doing the right thing
B	we thought we were doing the right thing
A	yeah but you can't
B	see
A	you can't please him you see
B	no no
C	no
A	whatever you do
B	yeah
A	for a
C	yeah
A	couple of hours and
C	yeah
A	and we sort of chat about the state of the world and stuff like that but
B	yeah yeah
A	you know
B	no but with his attitude
A	but with his attitude
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	you know he he just needs to sort himself out you know?
B	yeah
A	I mean he's gone
B	yeah
A	before he gets the state's pension so he's living off
B	off his his
A	his his works pension right?
B	works pension yeah
A	which is not that much you know I mean
B	mm
A	but it's not that much
B	yeah
A	for these two years before you get your state pension
B	well yeah they're
A	most of them are married and most of them have got whacking great pensions
B	yeah
A	from firms' pensions
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	you know what I mean? and they're sort of like really well off
C	mm yeah
A	compared to him
B	yeah
C	there are aren't there?
A	and he's er
C	loads of people really well off aren't they?
A	and he feels
A	like you know the poor relation
C	but you
B	yeah but surely
C	you get
A	and and yeah but
C	he surely gets more than the state pension doesn't he with his
A	yeah yeah he gets
C	oh
A	more than the state pension
B	well he gets a state pension and you get a pension
C	that's quite a lot then
A	yeah but
B	so
A	when he gets his pension he'll be alright right?
B	yeah
A	but I explained to him when he gave up work
C	mm
A	I said basically
B	yeah
A	that's how much money you'd earn in two and a half years
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	you know and that's a lot of money difference isn't it?
C	yeah
B	it is a lot of money yeah
A	you know sixty grand
C	yeah
A	whether you've got it or not
B	yeah
A	and he said oh I can't you know all this oh I can't work another day there I can't stand it blah blah blah
B	well he had a lot of rows with people there didn't he?
C	mm yeah
A	so now he give up work now he can't stand it being poor you know?
C	not poor though
A	what?
C	he's not poor though
A	well
C	you know yeah
A	he's not poor
C	yeah
A	he is poor because he's you know
C	he's
A	when he buys stuff he always buys the best you know and like
B	yeah
A	he he always spends money on
B	yeah yeah
C	mm
A	I mean like he made them four chairs right?
B	yeah
A	well they cost him a fortune to do that
B	did they? I thought he had
C	oh
B	all the wood there
A	no no no no no
B	oh
C	yeah
A	he bought all the wood in
B	wow
A	especially machined to shape
B	oh
A	alright? cos he found this site where you could just like give them the drawings and they would send you all the wood
B	all the wood
A	he you know exact measurements so you could
C	yeah
A	all he'd have to do is like put them together
B	put it together
A	yeah
C	oh
A	which obviously saves you a lot of time in planing and machining and stuff
B	well of course it does
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	which is like the boring bit of making something
C	mm
B	yeah that is
A	and er
C	mm
A	that cost him
B	yeah
A	and then
B	yeah we got one
C	mm
A	and
C	yeah
B	you know they're nice I mean I like them
B	they are nice yeah
C	yeah
A	you know I've got sort of six of them now I think
B	yeah?
C	we
B	we got three haven't we?
C	we've got three
A	yeah and but they cost him forty pound a piece
B	they do
A	and he buys like fifteen or
B	yeah
C	right
A	and you know you think
B	that is
A	you know when there's when you're hard up
B	yeah
A	I mean if you're earning a lot of money and you feel
B	that's alright yeah
A	with the largesse you know you think
B	yeah
A	you know I mean I gave him something
C	well you made him something
B	I made him a
A	mm
C	candlestick yeah
B	a candlestick yeah
C	mm
B	but then he's got a machine he can do all that can't he?
A	no
B	oh
A	don't think so
C	that's not the point anyway
B	no
C	doesn't actually if you can make it or not no
B	no
A	that's right
B	whether he appreciate it or not
C	yeah
A	well I gave him
B	yeah?
A	which was
B	oh wow
A	it was yeah
C	mm
A	it was the it was in the paper that someone had donated this a copy of this map
B	who who was it made by the map? er cos I had one made by
A	I dunno but there's
C	I dunno but
A	you know there's quite a few maps more recent than that
B	yeah
C	mm
A	sort of seventeen hundreds
B	yeah
A	but this was fifteen
C	mm
A	sixty this map
C	wow
A	and er a copy of it or a print of it had been given to this charity
B	yeah?
A	and like the print was done in
B	wow
A	and there was a picture of it on the EDP
B	oh so you go you got
A	so I so I
C	yeah
A	copied that off of off off the
B	yeah
C	right
A	right? and then photoshopped it a little bit to get it a bit more blew it up A3 had it printed and then er laminated
B	brilliant
C	mm
A	right? and it came out really really good
C	oh
B	did it?
A	yeah
B	oh brilliant
A	and er
C	mm
A	this sort of like
B	yeah he
A	stuff on there
B	he does doesn't he yeah
A	I thought you know what I
C	mm
A	but it's a
C	lovely
A	and it's a really good map
B	yeah
C	mm
B	brilliant
A	and er
B	well done
A	and he's interested in maps you see
B	yeah
A	well I mean that thing cost me nothing only the lamination and that
B	yeah
A	one pound fifty or something down the
B	we got a laminator and we can't get it working can we?
C	oh
A	have you?
B	yeah
C	yeah we we haven't used it at all
B	only an A4
C	no
B	it'll do only do A4s but
A	well
B	yeah well we
A	got to leave it for about half an hour before it before it'll warm up
B	our our
C	half an hour?
A	well I dunno I say half an hour it's probably about ten minutes
B	yeah well ours warm up and that don't that don't
C	well
B	pull it in
C	it didn't go in
B	it don't roll it in
A	was it a dear one or
B	well no
C	it was from Lidl
A	Lidl oh right
C	but
A	I'd take it back
B	yeah it was
C	well I couldn't find the receipt I've been looking for it and I I
A	mm
C	every receipt
A	yeah
C	on that type of thing but I can't find it and
A	yeah and
C	buy things thinking
A	yeah and you never it never works right
B	yeah
C	we were
A	mm
C	asking over the road weren't we to
B	yes that's right
C	laminate stuff
B	and then theirs stopped working it
C	and it cost quite a lot so we thought
A	well they're brilliant though when they work
B	yeah
C	so when we saw one we thought
A	they're
B	they're fantastic yeah
C	yeah we thought we'd get one
B	and we saw one in Lidl's
C	but we never
B	never never used it
A	mm
B	at all until
C	yeah
B	we wanted to
A	yeah get it out the box and
C	the weekend
A	and it didn't work
B	didn't work
C	mm
A	mm yeah
C	so I don't know whether
A	this sort of cheap stuff is always a bit of a gamble
C	yeah
A	whether that works or not isn't it?
B	yeah it is innit yeah that is yeah
C	I don't know whether to take it back and see what they say or
A	mm that's like
C	mm
A	er
B	no
C	oh
A	I'm sure I did
B	probably
B	oh yes you told me yeah no it's all ticking in now
A	and er yeah
B	yeah
A	but it was a you know got a
B	yeah
A	good performance and
B	yeah
A	stuff and of course
C	mm
A	and the hard drive was graunching away did I tell you that?
B	yes you did yeah
A	and it was sort of like
B	yeah
A	or I could get a new hard drive for it
B	you could yeah
A	and you see then
C	yeah
A	but then it's er rather gives over the point of getting a second
B	yeah
A	a refurbished cheap computer
C	yeah
A	when you've got to start spending money on it
B	money on it yeah
A	and then you're like in the end otherwise hardly I I don't want the problem about the hard drive sort of suddenly gives up the ghost and then I've got to recover all
C	no
A	and er so I've bought a new hard drive for it which cost set me back forty quid
A	I mean for a five you know half a terabyte you know
B	half a
A	cos like you know you sort of think
C	mm
A	you could but the the terabyte ones are are cheaper than the half terabyte ones
B	yeah why is that?
A	well because
C	mm
B	I noticed that
A	modern
B	you know
A	cos er you know er in when I bought it
B	yeah
A	so I thought well I don't need I'll just go for the
B	you don't need the bigger and you
C	yeah
A	and
B	yeah
A	and then today I looked and I the one terabyte ones the Seagate Barracudas right?
B	yeah
A	I mean they're only about forty quid now
B	wow
A	it's incredible innit?
C	yeah
B	that is innit?
A	and
B	that's like I've told you our first er well one of our computers is an IBM that was four
A	mm
B	four gigabytes
C	mm
B	when we bought that the bloke said you will never need
B	any more memory than
A	yeah
B	thirty-two megabyte memory
A	uhu
B	and four gigabyte hard drive you will need anything
A	yeah
B	more than that he said so that was
A	this was like
B	future
C	yeah
A	this is salesman's pitch isn't it?
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	mm
B	future-proof and and oh god
A	but anyway I've bought this also I bought for about fifteen quid this this er docking gizmo
B	oh right yeah
A	so I just stuck that in and
B	did it? good
A	really successful
B	right
C	yeah
A	but the funny thing is is that the old hard drive
B	oh
A	incredible innit?
B	it is isn't it yeah yeah
A	you know sort of how these how these things come on
B	yeah
A	cos you can get these
B	yeah
A	you know the things they put in these ultra slim er
B	yeah
A	laptops
B	laptops yeah
C	mm
B	laptops they have the
A	and they have like you know the terabyte stuff on them
B	yeah
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	that's a
B	how do they do it?
A	dunno
C	yeah
B	it's
A	cos I was thinking of putting a putting a erm what they call a hybrid drive in
B	oh right
A	which you know the first half is solid state
B	yeah
A	and then the main bit is so it's like having the solid state and a thing all in one
B	yeah
C	mm
A	but that would have been an extra twenty quid and I don't want to
B	oh right
A	I'll save that for doing mine
C	mm
B	I remember when
A	mm
B	and these little like that that was putting er
A	yeah
B	and that was going along and we sat there watching it was mesmerising weren't it?
A	yeah
B	watching this thing work
A	well it's like in the early days when you used to pay
B	yeah that's it
A	the cards would go
B	ding ding chink
B	yeah
A	and now they go
C	mm
B	and we had er ping-pong was it? on ours?
C	no we never had that
B	well with that ball come coming across tonk
C	no it we saw that when erm your brother had it didn't he?
B	oh my brother had it did he? which well we had mine digger or something
C	yeah mine digger
B	where it would go
B	and then
C	big game like a maze thing
B	and then and then hit granite and he couldn't go any further so we had to go
C	yeah
B	and then down again
A	I thought there was something I wanted to ask you
C	that was a good one
A	I don't know whether you could
B	yeah
A	well that's another thing
B	update it is he? or get rid of it?
A	well
B	oh well he can do that yeah
A	yeah cos I was sort of saying to him he should
B	yeah
A	you know he should have a nature blog
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	and he says well no one be interested in it no one would look at it and said yeah but it's there
B	yeah
C	mm
A	cos I was listening on the radio the other day there was some bloke who had started doing a nature diary when he was fourteen
B	yeah
A	and he was now sort of mid-fifties
C	yeah
A	et cetera etc etera
B	yeah
A	and it just gives you that historical change thing
C	it does
A	and was saying to
C	yeah
A	now or you know some time in the future that might be important
B	yeah
C	mm
B	yeah
A	well
C	my aunt did a you know diary of all
A	yeah
C	birds and things and
A	yeah but they are
C	that was so beautifully written as well
A	yeah
C	that you think
A	but they are important
C	yeah
A	you know when people are
B	yeah yeah
A	going back and looking
C	yeah
A	seeing changes
B	yeah
A	or something like that
B	yeah
A	and it's all because well perhaps not four perhaps three hundred years
B	well I thought they'd done it
A	how you
B	seventeen hundreds that went
A	yeah a daily record and it was all done by like vicars and people like this
B	yeah that's right yeah
A	and schools and that
C	mm
A	who kept these things like nobody looked at them when they did them
C	mm
B	no
A	but they had they had you know I dunno if your school had one did you?
B	yeah yeah
A	there's a weather station
B	yeah we did
A	and you had to record it
B	yeah
A	you know wet
C	yeah
A	wet bulb thermometer a dry thermometer
B	that's right yeah
A	wind direction
B	yeah
A	er
C	mm
B	out in the
A	the pressure you know air pressure
B	we even had one when we went to school camp we had had to do the weather
A	mm
B	and we had to do one there as well
A	yeah
B	all the
A	mm
B	coast and the weather inland
A	but I mean every primary school had one didn't they?
B	yeah yeah
A	and all these records which people thought were just
C	mm
A	and you've got this huge
B	right
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	a huge database
B	they have yeah
A	mm
B	not only you are talking about weather and the database there the database on plants and flowers and
A	mm
B	and when you think about how many people left Britain on their tours and picked up and drew all these wonderful wonderful plants and what have you
A	mm
B	and all recorded everything's been recorded
A	yeah
B	from way way back
C	yeah
A	yes that's right
B	it's fantastic innit?
A	I was sort of trying to explain
C	yeah
B	to
B	no
C	no
A	but I think he's got something in the back of his head that
B	yeah
A	he wants
C	mm
A	to be able to do
B	well he can do it but he's got to have the
A	well I
B	load it up
A	but I still use that old Dreamweaver that you give me
B	yeah
A	years ago
B	yeah yeah yeah that's good enough yeah
A	it seem to work
B	yeah
A	and now
B	oh right yeah
A	so when
B	oh right
A	so what's that?
B	and you'll
A	yeah
B	and er sometimes the server is down
A	yeah but this has happened over in the last two or three weeks and I keep checking it and
B	yeah
A	always comes up
C	mm
A	the server is
C	we get that on other sites don't we?
B	being updated
A	being updated
B	yeah
A	but
B	oh
A	and another thing I wanted to ask you you know
B	yeah the one the website yeah
A	your files right?
B	yeah yeah
A	what's the WWW folder for?
B	well you've got one haven't you you've put one you made it did you?
A	I don't know cos the thing the only as far I'm I can see the only one which is actually working is public
B	er
A	HTML
B	yeah so have you clicked on your WW folder?
A	yeah and it's full of everything
B	that's it yeah
A	cos what happened is is that I thought that was
B	I think that's the backup folder which
A	I'd forgotten
B	yeah
A	so when I renewed these files I stuck them in the WWW right? and then nothing was happening
B	oh right yeah
A	and then but it weren't no it wasn't nothing would happen
B	yeah
A	and then I suddenly sort of started looking it up and oh public that's the one you want
B	yeah
A	and then did them all in the public
B	well I made a WWW folder so that
A	mm
B	I could upload it when I want but that's completely useless
A	it doesn't do anything
B	it doesn't do anything
A	mm
B	and I told you I'm getting rid of it but it thought well
A	well I don't wanna get rid of it in case it does start
B	if I
C	yeah
B	if I get rid of it
A	yeah
B	you can put it in another place and if that don't work then
A	mm
B	you can bring it back can't you? you don't put it in the in the well you can put it
C	mm
B	you can put it in the in the bin
A	mm
B	but I got one exactly the same WW folder and I thought
A	yeah
B	well did I make that one?
A	but I was looking
B	yeah
A	blah blah blah and er it said something about
B	yeah
A	or your WWW
B	so that might be a backup?
A	I don't know I didn't know whether it was something to do with the fact that cos when I first started doing this I'd put I was putting the folders everywhere
B	yeah
B	that's right
A	are valid cos you've got
C	yeah
A	you know on your on your remote folders you've got all these VTI folders
B	that's it
A	a whole list of them
B	yeah
A	and you think what do they do? you know
A	and what are all these other folders and stuff and you think oh
B	well indeed no I thought well I was working on
A	mm
B	I don't really want it get rid get rid get rid get rid rid rid rid rid
A	mm
B	on your not
A	yeah
B	on your internet but not on
A	yeah
B	live
A	and you got rid of the wrong ones
B	oh god
B	I can't upload them any more so I had to download from the remote folder back down
A	uhu
B	into my local folder
A	but that's the the whole point of the
B	yeah
A	the getting put like
B	that's right yeah yeah
A	but I don't know how
B	yeah
A	and that's got everything in it
B	yeah
A	and it's
B	yeah
A	right? well theoretically
B	yeah
A	your folder comes up
B	all on
A	into public HTML
B	you could yeah
A	but I dunno how do you can't cos there ain't a sort of select all
B	yeah you can go on into your C drive
A	mm
B	right? and look at your properties in the C drive
A	mm
B	and copy that folder
A	mm
B	and put it in there
A	what just drag and drop it?
B	yeah well you'd need to
A	once you load it up
B	you'd need to drag yeah
A	yeah er yeah I know you can drag and drop it but in your C drive
B	you you'll go
A	that's what I'm saying it's already put there now
B	oh
A	you know cos that's
B	yeah
A	C drive
B	that's in your C drive
A	and but
B	it's not on your desktop or anything like that?
A	no no no it comes you know when you
B	that's it
A	which is on the
B	and local folder
A	local folders and it comes up it shows you
B	yeah
A	it's
B	yeah
A	folders so like two screens
B	yeah yeah
B	yeah
A	but I don't you know it's
B	right
A	you know if you changed everything
B	yeah
A	you you could put everything across all at once
B	you could yeah
A	but
B	well
A	I think all it's er
B	the main thing about the the er your folder when you when you open it up on the net when you're when you're actually on the net
A	mm
B	you're opening up either er the index file which is the most important one or someone we'll call another name oh I can't think of it I'll go and have a look in a minute and they're the two important files which will open up
A	mm
B	all the rest of the file
A	yeah but the index is the one that it looks for isn't it?
B	yeah
A	is the most important
B	yeah and then everything will work
A	mm
B	from that index file
A	but I still can't understand why
B	weird
A	it is weird
B	yeah
A	or maybe links to this server is not
B	oh I don't think
A	maybe the
B	yeah
A	see if it how it links to
B	yeah
C	mm
A	yeah
B	I'm just going to the loo
A	fabric pictures?
C	mm
B	no yes no
C	I should be yeah
B	yes she is
A	cos I've still got loads of this material right?
C	oh right yeah oh I'm always
A	I've got
C	looking for looking for material that inspires you
A	I've got erm
C	doesn't it?
A	I've got I think five
C	oh wow
A	well yeah
C	nice material
A	I don't think they were ever cleaned after she
C	mm?
A	I don't think she even dry cleaned them or anything after she wore them to these different
C	oh that's okay
A	proms or dos or like
C	yeah
A	but like they er they're alright but they there's sort of
C	right
A	some good material sort of
C	yeah
A	they're they're long and sort of got this sort of slinky sort of
C	right yeah that would be good anything
A	and I could bring it
C	yeah
A	cos I can't see they're ever gonna be
C	right
A	used for anything else
C	mm
A	you know I keep meaning to sort
C	yeah
A	you know I've got
C	yeah
A	which I keep thinking oh I'd better sort that out I never sort that out
C	yeah
A	every now and again
C	mm
A	and take them down the tip cos in the tip they've got this sort of clothes bank
C	oh I see right
A	and er
C	yeah nice material yeah are always
A	but these are sort of like
C	a good idea
A	sort of slinky material you see
C	yeah yeah
A	so there might be some use in them
C	yeah
A	I must remember to put them all together cos a long while I thought oh perhaps
C	okay alright
C	yeah
A	you know it's gotta be another fifteen years before
A	dress up
A	oh great
C	good?
A	she was here at Christmas time and er
C	is she? ah

B	yeah
A	not just sort of walking or anything
B	no or god
C	mm
A	was absolutely racing round and round and round the
B	yeah
A	you know like people used to say oh you
B	that's right yeah
A	it is like you think
C	well isn't
A	all that energy
C	yeah
A	honestly
B	you watch
C	yeah
B	going to school er
A	that's right yeah
B	and
A	yeah
C	mm
B	you know? if mum's got hold of them they're walking but
B	they're just skipping along running jumping whatever
A	yeah
C	nice innit?
A	it is yeah
B	and then
C	oh
B	when you get older you can't get your feet off the ground
A	that's right yeah
B	cor
A	what was that the other day?
B	yeah
C	they weren't even walking
B	yeah yeah
C	yeah
A	I was just sort of like stumbling along behind them
B	when we walk
C	yeah
B	we usually
C	I like
B	don't we?
C	I like to walk fast
B	I I have to run
C	yeah
B	to keep up
C	I do
B	with her
A	yeah
C	no you don't
A	well when we went
C	do you?
B	yeah
C	oh right
A	yeah when
B	yeah
C	mm
A	cos you know and she's going slowly
B	yeah
B	no that's that's great though innit? that is it's great
C	yeah
B	you don't you don't expect
A	you don't
B	anything like that when you're young do you?
A	that's right you don't realise
C	mm
A	do you know I always have this idea of
A	you know and and every year I
B	and plant some more
A	and er plant some more yeah
B	yeah
A	well
C	yeah
A	half an acre say
B	yeah
A	that would have been
C	yeah
B	cut
A	clear fell it and plant some more and then the time we got round the end
B	the others would be ready
[ANNOTATION]	She is going quickly.	Contradiction
A	that would be ready the others would be ready
C	yeah
A	to use
C	right
A	you know for fire wood
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	They should not plant anything more.	Contradiction
C	but ten acres?
A	and I what?
C	ten acres?
A	yeah ten acres
C	oh
B	ten-acre wood
A	I want and
[ANNOTATION]	It can be used to light a fire, when it is ready.	Entailment
C	wow
A	yeah I mean you'd probably do it with five acres actually
C	mm
B	yeah
A	if you grew something like hazel or something or ash
B	or or even ash yeah
C	mm
A	and er
[ANNOTATION]	The only option is to plant 10 acres of pine trees.	Contradiction
B	yeah
C	mm
A	and then you don't realise that when you get old enough to need it you can't do it
B	no
C	yeah
A	you know there's absolutely no chance
[ANNOTATION]	You can do it when you are older.	Contradiction
B	well we we thought we'd
C	yeah
B	we were going to buy the field next door didn't we?
C	yeah well
B	thirty-nine acres
C	when when we first came here yeah
B	when we first come here we thought well we'll have we'll we'll go and see farmer and see if we can buy that field
C	see if we can get a little bit extra just to
B	get a bit extra
C	plant the trees
A	mm
B	well we went and saw him and he said oh and he said er just down the road there's another four acres didn't he?
C	oh I didn't know about that one
B	yeah and I went down and had a look at this other four acres and
A	mm mm
B	but er I didn't get it
A	yeah of course
C	mm
A	of course
C	yeah yeah
B	yeah he's got half of
A	yeah
B	I don't know what he's gonna do with it cos
A	well once he gets his multimillion pound shopping complex going that'll be
B	well that's right
C	yeah
A	like a breath of fresh air to
B	that would well yeah
A	or not
B	or not yeah
C	mm
A	mind you they keep talking about building another five hundred houses
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	bit bit more er life
B	well they're talking about
B	houses down there
C	mm
B	and twenty-three up there now I think they want don't they?
C	mm
A	yeah
B	there you go
C	yeah
A	dunno where these people have got to work though
B	I don't know where they're going to work and
C	no
B	don't know what sort of roads they've got to drive on but
A	yeah
C	not a lot round here is there?
B	you know?
A	but I mean the thing is is that you know normally
B	yeah
A	and then the people come and live there don't they?
B	that's right
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	but at the moment they just sort of build houses and
B	and they finish up as
C	yeah
A	mm
B	sort of er slum type places well if they build new estates like they built the
A	mm
C	mm
A	but the er no they do put some decent estates up in
B	yeah
A	I mean they've built some crappy ones as well but some of them are good
B	yeah
C	mm
B	yeah
A	like the
B	yeah
B	it go for miles don't it?
C	yeah
A	well they're thinking of of of er erm
B	yeah
A	across towards
B	all up round there
A	you know around the back of
B	yeah
A	erm
B	who did that belong to then?
A	that belonged to that bloke who's got them who farms them organic cows and that
B	oh right
A	what's his name?
B	oh yeah
A	oh goodness knows
B	can't think of his name
A	but he's got that land which goes all the way down as far as the erm
B	oh that
C	what that used to be the garden centre?
A	the garden centre
C	oh right
B	yeah
A	cos he was complaining about the garden centre was spoiling is drainage and
B	oh was he? oh right
C	yeah
A	what the hell was his name?
B	I can't think of it
A	I'm not like
C	mm
A	but anyway they sort of like
C	mm
A	all of that bit of land there
B	yeah
A	you know either side of the
C	yeah
A	railway line
C	mm
A	developed
B	yeah
A	and then on the other side of the road
C	yeah
A	at
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	all the way from opposite the
B	yeah
A	all the way back to
B	wow
A	gonna be developed as well
C	gosh wow
B	cos
A	and squeezing that little
C	mm
A	that farm in the middle
B	yeah
A	on the corner
B	well that's what's gonna happen
C	mm
B	to that? well I suppose he'll have to sell up will he?
A	I dunno
B	cos we we used to go up
A	well there's that
C	yeah
A	there's that footpath isn't there which comes
B	that's right
A	of the road
B	yeah
A	and it goes all the way round the back and comes out at
B	does it? oh I don't know where it
A	well it's
B	I haven't been there
C	but no never done that route
A	yeah it's sort of well it's more than a footpath I think it's sort of a track
B	yeah
A	and I think everything inside that
B	well a bridleway
A	is gonna be on like
C	oh
A	they're talking about developing
C	mm
A	but it's like all these things they they talk about it and they get knocked back it's what we were saying before
C	yeah
A	isn't it?
B	yeah yeah
A	then they talk about it some more and then they amend it and then
B	that's it yeah
A	they talk about it some more and then they get it approved
B	yeah
C	but apparently
B	no
C	I mean they haven't done that five-year plan or something that they should have done
A	that's right yeah
B	yeah
C	and therefore anyone can do anything
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	apparently
B	apparently they can yeah
A	that's probably all to do with the
B	yeah
A	I mean they run the planning department
B	yeah
A	so they're
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	well there's a big development from
C	yeah
C	mm
B	yeah
A	all round round there
B	well they're all over the country
A	in in
B	they are yeah
C	yeah
B	and Travis
A	I dunno Travis Travis
C	they just look for any spare bit of land don't they that
B	well they they used to be Tarmac and all that
A	yeah I mean they like you say they buy up all this land don't they?
B	yeah
C	mm
B	yeah
A	they're always out out for
C	yeah
B	well I mean it used to most of the land used to belong
A	yeah
B	yonks ago to the insurance companies
A	mm
B	they were on the thing they were on this
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	weren't they? and that's how they
C	mm
A	they earned owned a lot of farms didn't they so
B	they did yeah
A	yeah
B	so I don't know what's happened to them
A	well it's all
B	it just
A	monopoly money innit?
B	of course it is
A	that's what it is
C	yeah
A	well I mean you know you aren't gonna
B	you're never gonna stop it no
A	but I mean
C	yeah
A	there's been a shortage of house building ever since the sixties wasn't it?
B	yeah yeah
A	I mean even the sixties there was a bit of a boom weren't there
B	there was a bit of a boom in the
A	they were building houses everywhere
B	yeah
A	and er but since then it's been it's been a bit stagnant
B	but I mean when they're when they're allowed to build houses everywhere they usually like er
C	I don't know I can't remember
B	and they they put in
A	mm
B	and because they put in forty-one houses
A	oh right
A	yeah
B	so there's no
A	but sometimes they do that and they don't tell anyone and no one notice
B	no
C	no this is what it happened
A	yeah
B	this this is what happened yeah
C	no one knew
A	yeah
B	no one that it happened
C	no one actually goes oh one two three four
A	yeah
B	so all the
C	you've got too many
B	down there
B	have got to cross the road to be able to push a pram or a pushchair
A	yeah
B	or take kids for a walk cos you the footpath is literally
A	mm
B	eighteen inches wide at the very most
B	you know
A	yeah well
C	and none of the garages you can't get a car in can you?
B	no none of the garages
C	you can't
B	can get a car in
C	you can't get out with the car
A	who parks in a garage though that's what they say
B	well that's right
A	don't they?
B	yeah who parks in garages?
A	and while cars are getting bigger
B	yeah yeah
C	but if you get the car in the garage
B	if you get the car in they they got
C	you can't get out the door
B	this
A	yeah yeah
B	so you drove in you can't get out the door
A	but there's yeah
B	yeah
A	and they reckon Britain is sort of below European standards
B	standards
A	on the amount of
C	yeah
A	living space
B	living space yeah
A	in our house
B	yeah
C	but then
A	cos the rooms are so small
B	well when you go into some of the kitchens
C	then like they've been knocking the walls out like the
B	yeah
C	the kitchen diner's
A	mm
C	huge
B	you go into a kitchen and I mean you even see it on the on the television on Homes Under the Hammer and places like that you see the kitchen has
C	mm
B	and she's just like that
A	mm
B	and you got the
C	yeah
B	and no room for anything else
A	well my sister lived in a house
B	yeah
A	and
B	yeah
A	you know there was just enough room to walk between the
B	yeah
A	the the units and you could just about turn round
B	but two people wouldn't work in it
A	and some of these fat people wouldn't get in there
A	and like like you say you could probably touch the walls both sides
B	yeah
A	but the
B	obviously
A	funny thing is is that all these new houses that they build like that
B	they do yeah
A	you know
B	they do yeah
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	in in in any old little house
B	but if they want to build these
C	but it's got to be camerawork hasn't it most of it
B	yeah that is camera work
C	it has
B	they use these wide-angled lenses
C	but everywhere is so big isn't it?
B	don't they as well
A	yeah
B	cos you can see the wide Anglican lenses
A	mm
B	that bend the doors
A	mm
B	like that
A	mm
B	if I don't think that any house builder
A	mm
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	I know yeah I dunno I can't understand the houses they're putting up
B	I mean it's these these
A	they are
B	I mean these cupboards come down from everywhere and
A	yeah
C	mm
B	and you can
A	and they just fold out
B	fold out this and fold out that
C	well
B	surely if they want to build flats they could build
A	mm
B	flats exactly the same as that can't they?
A	well
B	on top of one another
A	or build a house
C	well they do do those pods don't they that actually
B	oh they do them pods
A	they do yeah
B	yeah
C	that they actually transport the whole
B	yeah

A	before the days of er er
B	yeah
A	where you could
B	health and
A	make a comment
B	yeah
C	oh it was just just a lady
B	yeah
C	mm
B	well it was yeah
A	well and I used to stay in quite a few little bed and breakfast and digs and things like that
B	yeah
A	and I was moving around the countryside and er
B	well of course you are yeah
A	but a lot of the places were sort of alright
B	passable yeah
C	I'm sure they are
A	I mean
C	yeah
A	especially a lot of when er when you'd stay in pubs cos quite often a pub would have a
C	yeah
A	he'd have bed and breakfast and they would say they would say well you know I have to leave early to get to work and they'd say oh well
B	yeah
A	and so you'd get up and you'd be sitting in the bar and there'd be a kettle there and
A	a bowl of cornflakes
C	yeah
A	or something and a toaster
B	yeah
A	you know
C	right
A	like all all you know it was plenty good enough and you were sitting there
C	yeah
A	and that's how bloody trusting they are
B	yeah
A	cos you've got a bar full of
B	full of drinks
A	stocked full of drinks
C	yeah
A	and stuff like that
B	yeah
A	some people I know would have just like
B	well help yourself
A	had a whole bottle of scotch for breakfast
B	yeah
B	well that's true yeah
A	you know but
C	yeah
A	you know cos they didn't wanna get up they'd been working late you see
B	well of course they had yeah
C	yeah
B	yeah cor
C	yeah
B	that's quite amazing though what people can get or could get away with years ago
A	mm
C	mm
B	before this er health and not health and safety what environmental health come through now everything got to be
C	oh yeah well we haven't actually I've got to fill in the form first
B	oh you've got to fill in the form
A	what for?
C	get a well I still want I still want my number
A	what?
B	that number we got on the
C	for when just
B	on the
C	providing food
B	providing for
A	yeah
B	childmind?
C	it was when we
B	yeah
C	when we used to do meals for children
B	we did meals for children
A	what they wanna come and inspect you?
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	well
C	well I just want to keep our environment because we had we had a five first
B	we did
C	and then I didn't do the paperwork for this second one so it came went down to four but
A	what you still got them?
B	yeah
A	but why do you do it?
C	nothing
B	it's it's er
C	for our window
B	up in the window outside there
A	yeah what what does it say?
B	it just says that
C	well
B	we are four-star we were
A	what?
A	yeah
B	grub
A	but who are you feeding?
C	well we're not at the moment
B	we're not at the moment
A	yeah but do you intend to?
C	but we did when we got that one
B	no not really
C	and I'm just thinking
B	only if people are come to dinner
C	I I don't mind keeping it that's all
C	so
C	well
A	you're mad
C	why not?
A	well this what you should do is like
B	that's true that is true
C	but it's not costing us anything
A	make a break
B	yeah
A	mm
B	for the cheeses and what you we chucked most of them away but we've kept a montage of all what we used to do
A	yeah
B	all that sort of stuff all stuck to it haven't we?
C	well we had to for
A	you had to?
C	yeah no I mean we had to get them together before
A	oh
B	yeah
B	yeah that's right for the ADAS report
C	yeah so
B	so we kept all that and chucked
C	so that's just yeah
B	we had about ten thousand labels to chuck away
C	we had to throw them away
A	well this is the trouble when you order them you I mean in those days it's not so bad now but you had to order them
B	you had to order a lot
A	in bulk didn't you?
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	boxes full
A	that's right yeah
B	we had boxes full
A	that's right
C	mm
B	and and yogurt pots
C	we did
B	we had
A	mm
B	tonnes of yogurt pots didn't we?
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	never mind
A	I kind of
C	I didn't think there was any harm in just trying to keep our
A	keep your standards up
C	yeah that's right
B	keep your standards up yeah
C	I don't mind
A	see you might need to do bed and breakfast you see and then you've got
C	mm
B	no I don't want to no I don't want anything to do with that
C	yeah I'd quite like to do that
B	I'm not having it no I'm not having it no no no
A	I don't blame you
B	no that is where I put my foot down I let you get away with everything else
A	yeah
B	but I don't not having people come round here
A	mm it's like
B	yeah?
A	you know to help out with the money or but there's this thing
B	yeah
A	you know for business or something like that and then you can sort of like check their mail their profile and that
C	yeah
B	oh I see yeah
A	and er if you agree you like like you agree on the net
C	yeah
A	then you say okay you can turn up
B	yeah
A	you know
B	oh wow
A	so it's sort of like you know it's a bit you know not people just turn up out of hand
B	no
C	yeah
A	and er I forget what it's called now but apparently it's
C	yeah
A	you know
B	yeah
A	so that they you know if they need to go somewhere they can arrange this sort of
B	yeah
A	without having to go to the hassle of applying to
C	yeah
A	hotels or what have you and and you know you even get sort of like-minded people
B	yeah yeah
C	yeah
B	that's a good idea yeah
A	I forgot what
C	yeah
A	the hell was it called?
C	mm
A	but anyway someone in who
B	yeah?
A	and they were sort of like saying how
C	yeah
A	great it was
B	it would make me creep that does
A	yeah
B	having people walking about your house
C	yeah
A	cos especially nowadays people seem to expect really high
B	yeah
C	they do
A	standards don't they?
B	yeah
C	mm
A	and you know my standards aren't that high
B	no
A	you know
C	yeah
A	you know I mean you know perfectly ordinary but I mean people seem to have want
B	yeah they do yeah
A	when you read some of these things that people write about hotels you know and how
B	yeah
A	they blooming complain you know you've got just a list of complaints you know that everything wasn't superb
B	yeah
A	that you know
C	yeah
B	well I mean if you if you're
C	yeah
B	asking for a bed for the night that's all you're gonna get innit? you know
A	mm
B	you can go to a you go to a cheap Premier Inn or something like that
A	yeah
B	you know you're going to get like a cell block
C	oh yeah we did go to that one
B	about a hundred and forty years ago now we went to France and we er
A	mm
B	why they have to go to France to buy it I dunno cos it cost a fortune to get down to Dover and then
B	then go across on the thing don't it? anyhow we go to France and
C	yeah
A	yeah they all are now
B	oh that was a vile place
A	yeah
B	it was absolutely vile
A	mm
B	weren't it?
C	yeah really dark corridors and no good
B	dark corridors and doors off each
B	you know
C	mm
B	oh that was creepy and it was horrible it was it was horrible
A	now that's what your Premier Inn'll be like
C	see that one
B	yeah
A	no they have quite
C	we'll see
A	but you know
A	we've been
C	sounds nice
A	to ones in in France you know and you sort of
C	yeah
A	and you're sort of like checking out trying to find this you know formula one or whatever the local
B	yeah
A	sort of Premier Inn type place is and then you you see the signs for it you know in the middle of town
B	and then there's nothing
A	and they're sort of bringing you out and it take and you're sort of in the countryside into some industrial estate
A	and like in this industrial estate there's a mass of roads you know and you find oh year here's the Premier Inn
C	right
A	and you stop there and you think
A	we've got nothing here we'll go into town and have a meal
C	yeah
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	and then you eventually you find the industrial estate
C	mm
A	and you're driving around that for about
A	you know a quarter of an hour trying to find where the blooming thing is
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	but at one time in France when we used to go there it used to be brilliant cos you could drive into any
B	yeah
A	and there'd always be
B	somewhere to stay
A	places to stay
B	yeah
A	yeah sort of really reasonable
B	yeah
A	and they were all
C	yeah
A	in the middle of town you know
B	yeah
A	like you know like you know hotel
B	yeah
A	where the train station is or a hotel Marie where the in the main town square right?
B	yeah
A	and slowly all these little places are all closed down now
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	and what they've done they've built these Premier Inn type places
C	yeah
A	out on the industrial estates
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	and you know so you're not even in the centre of town any more
B	well they like to keep the
C	well
B	cocooned in one great big place where they
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	it's a shame though
B	that is a shame yeah
C	yeah
A	I mean even in
C	yes
B	yeah it's on the bus station yeah
C	yeah
A	I mean that's a really good place to situate the place
B	that is yeah
C	mm
B	and then you've got yeah you
C	yeah you
A	well even when that one at
B	that one that one on the train station as well
A	yeah
A	dunno oh yeah er if you walk
B	yeah you've got yeah you've got one there ain't you?
A	but you er when we used to stay in Durham
B	yeah
A	on this sort of bit of
C	yeah
A	motorway and
C	yeah
A	and all you had was like motorway you know
B	yeah
A	and you were sort of standing amid but at least
C	oh
A	you weren't in an industrial estate
B	well that's right
A	but then if all you want to do is put your head down
B	yeah but I'd like to put my head down in a in a decent type of place where you know
C	yeah
B	where you get the actual light shining through the window
A	mm well they don't have too don't have too many
C	oh dear alright what are their breakfasts like? cos we haven't booked breakfast
A	you haven't?
C	no we
A	well
B	no
A	usually is
C	we don't know how much they are even do we?
A	it it depends the worst breakfast we ever had was at a a a Bannatyne's
B	oh right
A	you know him on er
B	yeah
A	in Dragons' Den
B	yeah on Dragons' Den
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	he's got a load of hotels
B	that's it yeah he has yeah
A	and we got this deal up in
B	yeah?
C	oh
A	and er
B	oh
A	but you know
C	oh right
A	and then we had this sort of breakfast
B	was it?
A	it was
C	oh
A	absolutely horrible and
C	we'll go out for breakfast then
A	I don't know what no but that was the worst one right?
C	yeah no you can't tell no
B	put the kettle on again
A	I mean other ones
C	yeah yeah right
B	you'll want that
C	yeah
A	other places we've been to like a lot of some of these Premier Inns they have this sort of erm
C	yeah
A	where you go down there and they have and
C	they do
A	they always have these really complicated toaster things you know these machines where you
B	oh yeah
A	you have to put your bread in and then it goes up and then flips over and comes back down again
A	and you get loads of people queueing up to toast their bits of bread
A	you know
C	yeah
A	but they're usually
C	yeah
A	they're alright you know
B	yeah
A	I mean perfectly alright but I don't think they
C	mm
A	see
B	no?
A	well I mean you
B	yeah
A	which are there on the buffet and then you can I think you can ask for eggs but
B	yeah
A	there's plenty to eat you know what I mean? there's sort of I like cereal and fruit and toast
B	yeah
A	and stuff like that
C	mm
B	when we go when we go on those erm YHA
C	mm
B	meetings you have breakfast the next morning
A	mm
B	and
C	well you have breakfast when we stop over don't we?
B	yeah
A	mm
B	really lovely
C	it's really good
A	yeah
B	and I have a sausage just
A	yeah but I'm not I'm not a great one for
C	well we have the whole lot so we can go out for a walk
A	you have the whole lot
C	for the whole of the
B	we have the
C	rest of the day
B	the whole lot she have everything and I have everything and I eat half
C	yeah

C	that's the only thing we otherwise eating meals we share don't we?
B	we share evening meals
C	at breakfast we have one each
B	breakfast we have we have
B	I have to start off the day
C	it's only four pound fifty so it's
B	yeah yeah four pound fifty for a breakfast that ain't too
C	have whatever you want
B	too bad
A	mm
B	I mean but er that's that's a big spread and you go along and help yourself to this that and the other and
A	yeah yeah
C	yeah
A	see even the one we went to in London which was
B	yeah
C	mm
A	even then they had a good breakfast
B	yeah
A	and you know you could eat you could go up and sort of help yourself
B	lovely
A	and you sat down and eat it and there's nothing to stop you going up again and having another go
B	no no
A	and it was all nice stuff
B	trouble is my my eyes are bigger than my gut
A	mm well quite often they you know and you get a little plate you see here
A	so you have to go up twice
C	yeah
B	I I find it very difficult to refuse food
A	mm
B	when it's when it's just there and
A	when it's free?
B	yeah
A	mm well I told you about when we were in Germany
B	yeah
A	bread rolls and ham and
B	that's it yeah
A	stuff like that
B	yeah
A	and different types of ham and
B	some cheeses as well
A	cheese yeah
B	oh
A	jugfuls of cream and that
B	oh go on
A	and of course me and
A	and cream and sugar on them
C	you almost wish you could eat more don't you?
A	and and we were eating these
A	and we were just about to finish
C	oh
A	and we'd eaten practically all these strawberries
A	oh
B	well that's right
A	you know they should have been a bit quicker off the mark
B	well we're nearly always first in to breakfast
A	mm
C	oh yeah
B	and they
B	sometimes aren't even ready behind the
A	yeah
B	the you know cooking the stuff
C	mm
C	yeah
B	but
A	well we're usually so tight that
B	that's all we have is porridge
A	yeah and what have you and
B	yeah
A	maybe a cereal or something so I sort of think well you know I'm not going to be a glutton just cos I'm out you know
B	no
A	and she'll say why not? and I'm quite happy with it and a
B	oh right
A	and they'd been there'd been a blizzard the night before and everything
A	everything was snowed in
A	and I sort of declined because I thought it might be it might cost me again you see
B	yeah
A	but it was quite funny cos in the evening we'd got there quite late
B	yeah
A	and er you know there was all snow and stuff around
B	yeah
A	and er
B	yeah
A	like
B	thank you
A	you know it wasn't proper food
A	and she couldn't eat it it was horrible
B	really? oh god

A	mm what's this?
B	mm?
A	is this hard toffee that'll pull your teeth
B	will it?
A	really?
B	yeah
A	and how are they?
B	they're brilliant
A	mm?
B	I got to go back though cos
B	well
C	but they hurt me
B	one of them hurt me
A	mm
B	but other than that
A	well
B	that's good
A	I
C	mm
A	I never wore mine I recently
B	no you said
C	oh
A	but you know that's my fault because I never went back and had them fitted properly
A	mm
B	they er left a bit in up here used to get
A	up there your tooth don't go that far
B	well he said if I try and take out er I'll be taking half your jaw away
A	mm
B	half your cheekbone away
C	nice
B	so they left that bit in wherever it is
A	mm
B	and I still got a great big hole in it
C	mm
B	and I I caught it last night while I was cleaning my teeth and it bled like a
A	oh god
B	you know so
C	mm
B	be able to not use them
C	you've been back once already haven't you?
B	yeah I've gotta go back yeah
A	well when I had mine
B	he was an idiot though he says you've got to get used to them I said yeah but you can't get used to them if they're cutting into your gum can you?
A	mm
C	not for two hundred and
B	not for three hundred a fifty quid thank
C	no I think it was two hundred and something
A	mm
C	on er
A	but the er my dentist said
C	mm
A	you know people you know you have to usually come back two or three times
B	mm
C	yeah
B	stroppy
C	there you are I've got to go and fit
B	when I went there
C	it's quite normal
B	and he say you got to get used to them I was like you
A	mm
B	cutting into my gum
A	have you tried that Fixodent yet?
B	no
A	cos I think once you once you get used to them
B	does it?
A	cos it cushions it all the way round
B	oh right
A	but if it's nipping the gum
B	mm
A	that has to be ground away
B	yeah
A	there's no two ways about it
B	that's right yeah
A	you know cos that was the trouble with mine I kind of my last molar at the back there which it was sort of like clipped onto
B	mm
A	on the inside of the gum
B	oh right
A	and that is really really really sensitive
B	yeah
A	and you know when I tried putting my teeth into it was like someone trying to jam a needle
B	oh
A	or a nail into me I mean it was really really painful
B	mm
A	and then I thought well and then I started getting like that the last tooth started aching a bit
B	mm
A	but not bad enough to just an ache not a pain
B	yeah
A	you know what I mean?
B	yeah I know what you mean yeah
A	and er
B	yeah there's not point is it
A	I'll just survive as I was before
B	that's how I feel
C	mm lovely
B	delicious
A	mm
C	mm
A	mm
B	has she?
A	yeah but they
C	oh right
A	lost them again
B	oh
C	that was quick then
A	yeah well they phoned she was sort of like oh really panicking about getting another enough work to keep you know solvent and er
B	oh right
A	so that was brilliant you know cos that's you know the difference between
B	yeah
C	mm
A	being hard up and having a bit to spare and so she started there and er
B	mm
C	oh
A	and then the next one she went to there was only two people turned up
C	was that an art thing or
A	no that's maths this is
C	oh really?
A	and er
C	oh
A	then she told them then the next one she went to there was only one person but a different person turned up
B	oh crikey
C	yeah
A	and then they said oh well we'll have to knock it on the head
B	yeah cos you need quite a few people to make it pay don't you?
A	well they need five well this it's a council thing you see
B	yeah
A	and they pay
B	yeah
A	so if you've got five there it's only costing them five pound an hour per head isn't it that's nothing when you compare what
B	no
A	the council waste money on
B	yeah
A	I mean
C	really?
A	cos they they were wicked
C	yeah
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	the car park there and race up and down
C	oh
B	that's right yeah
A	and they said oh it's dangerous so we've put these ramps in and they had these
B	oh wow
A	right?
B	yeah I know the sort yeah
A	you know sort of black and yellow painted things
B	yeah
A	and they were like that and not only one across the entrance they had them sort of like four or five of them sort of dotted along the road
C	oh
A	and er
B	even more dangerous I should
A	of course yeah people with wheelchairs
B	no
A	like if you were driving a car
B	some some
A	knocking the hell out of your car
B	some some cars ground on them ones don't they?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	and
C	mm
A	you know they just haven't got a bloody clue you know
B	they haven't have they no
A	they do then they had to take them and sort of god knows how much that cost
B	well even our our ramps in er
A	yeah I know the ones
B	the ones
A	mm
B	but there's a couple of them where they're sunk down
A	mm
B	and if you take get that bit wrong even at twenty mile an hour
A	yeah
B	that throw you about
A	yeah
B	they're thinking about taking them out now and putting them chicane type ones in you know the ones that
A	yeah but they don't need to I mean
C	no they haven't taken
A	in towns I mean you look at
B	yeah yeah
A	where they got the sign over it
B	yeah
C	oh yeah
A	like there's no sign of any speed limits there
B	no
A	there's no ramps there
B	no
A	but the traffic just drives really slowly doesn't it?
B	they do yeah
A	cos they got them brick things across the road
B	yeah
A	which they're not
B	which people can walk across
A	yeah but they're not
C	yeah
A	legal
B	no
A	crossings
B	no they're not and people just
A	they're just
B	stop for them though don't they?
A	that's right but you know it's sort of like a courtesy thing
B	yeah
A	and er
B	and that work well don't it?
A	it works really well
B	yeah
A	and if like
B	yeah
A	all they need is these sort of like things across and people wouldn't wouldn't race up and down it
B	no they wouldn't no
A	whoops
B	but I tell you what do happen sometimes at night the boy racers on their motorbikes
C	yeah
B	they're up and down there
A	they love that
B	they love it don't they?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	that's right
B	well and you you can hear them at one o'clock
A	yeah
B	in the morning going
A	yeah
B	up and down there
A	but it's like anything you know whatever you do there'll always be some
C	yeah
A	idiots
B	yeah they got some nice ones where did we come from
C	er through
A	oh you went down to
B	I don't know what did we do in
C	oh just went to
B	up near Asda way we went up there
C	yeah
B	and had a look at something
C	some
B	some bits and pieces
A	mm
B	and they're
A	yeah
B	really good you you can negotiate them just right
A	yeah
B	and you don't go bump bump
A	that's right
B	bump bump
A	yeah they like some of them on
B	yeah
A	down there where
C	yeah
A	you can get the low bit or if
B	I see yeah
A	you get at worse
C	yeah
A	go on there you can
B	you can just get
A	and just so you
C	yeah
A	yeah you can
C	you can
A	but I mean
C	they're all a bit
A	it's
C	silly though aren't they? really
A	yeah
C	I think they are
A	yeah
B	yeah they're all a bit silly yeah
C	oh well
A	like in London now all the back streets are all twenty mile an hours limits
B	yeah yeah
C	yeah
A	or not all of them but
C	yeah
A	a lot of them are
B	yeah
A	and you know cars just get into that habit of just crawling along
C	yeah
B	they do don't they?
C	I mean
A	yeah
C	you've got one of those signs that flashes you know when you're
A	mm
B	yeah
C	you're going
B	and that remind you if you're going
C	the speed
B	too fast
C	if you're too fast
A	mm
C	it's thirty
B	and it's yeah
C	please slow down
B	and think you've gotta do thirty and you
C	well
B	and
A	yeah
C	that's good enough really
B	you know you
A	well thirty is too fast in towns anyway
B	yeah
C	yeah although
A	you know over the amount of
C	the twenty or something or
A	yeah mm
C	yeah it is too fast
B	but the road that annoys me
C	in
B	yeah twenty's plenty
C	the kids have done
B	but they got
C	the signs
B	they have thirty mile limits
C	but it is thirty
A	yeah
C	yeah but
B	but
C	I always try and get down to twenty going past the school where it's the signs come on
B	well it says twenty yeah the
A	mm
C	I think why not? twenty is plenty
B	but I like I like to keep
B	to the limit now
A	no I do since I got done
B	yeah
B	I mean
A	no
B	and they drive right up behind you
C	yeah
B	you know especially big lorries big lorries do that
A	mm
B	all the time drive right up behind you and you're doing thirty and you think
A	well I don't understand
B	yeah
C	mm
A	which is supposed to record their speed and that so how come on the motorways they're all doing
B	seventy mile an hour
A	seventy-five?
B	yeah
C	yeah yeah
A	you know
B	and I suppose they got fifty on them haven't they? on
A	have they?
B	on the back
A	I think it's sixty
C	don't think they have any
A	I think I don't think they're supposed to do more than sixty but they definitely aren't supposed to do seventy
B	no they're not
C	mm
B	but on on the back of most of these lorries there there is er how am I driving?
A	mm
B	phone 0 eight hundred whatever
B	and it there's a plague on there saying fifty miles an hour
C	mm
B	and
A	but I mean they wouldn't get anywhere
B	sixty kilometres
A	if they were doing fifty would they?
B	no they wouldn't no
A	I mean it is ridiculous I mean there's no reason why they shouldn't do sixty-five on the motorway
B	and
C	mm
B	and there's no reason why they shouldn't just have that one lane for them
A	mm that's right
B	the lorry lane if you like
A	and there is
C	yeah if they didn't keep weaving in and out
B	yeah
A	yeah well exactly trying to overtake
B	yeah
C	like that's the bad
A	innit?
B	oh god
A	and you got the A1 and
C	oh
A	they go steaming down and they he pulls out and then they're going uphill again
C	that's right
B	and you know they're going and you think oh why?
C	yeah
B	you know
C	you're holding everyone else up
B	why do they do it?
A	oh cos there it's they get so bored I suppose
B	oh
C	mm
A	they have to do it
C	yeah
B	they are idiots some of these well I mean if you're a lorry driver you'd probably do the same wouldn't you so
A	mm
B	I have been a lorry driver in my time
C	you'd think you can overtake but don't half the time well you can't
B	can't drive a lorry any more you know
A	no?
C	don't want to
B	I'm too old and decrepit
A	well you were at sixty I think weren't you?
B	yeah I was er yeah
A	I think at sixty you have to take the test every year don't you?
C	no it's seventy
A	after that
B	seventy now
A	is it seventy?
B	yeah yeah
C	yeah you definitely have to take the test don't you?
B	I got the er
C	only if you want to be a lorry driver
B	yeah
A	mm
B	do you want to take your test again or do you want your
A	but did you have to get your driving licence
C	no
A	saying that
B	no I never never did
C	no
B	I could drive
A	cos there's at seventy how old are you now?
B	seventy
A	I thought that came no perhaps it's seventy-five where you have to
B	probably
C	maybe
B	I said to
C	yeah
B	this is donkey's years ago I said to
C	yeah
B	that's it you can do all the driving
C	and and we kind of said well probably won't need a car then
B	probably won't even need a car
C	we'll just get a taxi
A	no
C	if we want to go anywhere
A	that's right yeah well I mean you
C	save all that insurance and
A	yeah but the thing is is that
C	but you don't do you?
A	people are a lot
C	you need it
A	fitter nowadays than they used to be
B	well that's right I can still run about
A	I mean
B	I can still get around
A	mm
B	you know
A	but erm
C	we couldn't go to any of the places we go to
B	no we couldn't
C	you know so
A	still drives well he's
B	he's ninety odd isn't he?
A	he's ninety-four
B	ninety-four yeah
C	yeah
A	and I think I dunno whether he actually drives anywhere but he's still got a car on the road
B	yeah
C	oh
B	want me to pull that down a bit?
A	no no I was looking at the er there was a
B	oh
A	load of birds
B	oh we got some birds out and about in the front
A	I noticed that
B	you know
A	when I walked round it
C	mm
A	there's
B	god there's some birds now
A	and a squirrel
C	squirrel
B	a squirrel as well
A	yeah
C	he's trying to bite through the
A	and trying and
C	plastic thing
B	yeah he
C	he probably will eventually
A	gonna get yeah
C	cos we're not there now are we?
B	no
C	he kind of leaps up go away
B	and he and he run he jumps down
A	well what you wanna try is
A	right? and then prop it up I the window
B	yeah that would be a good idea
A	that would be a good idea
B	yeah
C	do you think it would work?
A	it would
C	on a motor that goes like that
A	er?
C	you know
A	well you wouldn't even need that
C	it moves
A	soon as he could see you were looking out the window
B	he's ever so clever though that squirrel you know
C	yeah
B	I had a bucket once
A	uhu
C	the base yeah
B	and he come running up and go bonk and he hit his head on the on the top of the bucket cos
A	yeah
B	can't go any further and he comes down and he goes mm
C	easy enough
B	I mean they're brilliant they're so sensible
C	a sensible squirrel
A	well you know when I had that rat?
B	oh yeah
A	on my bird table
B	yeah you did didn't you? he was a lovely one weren't it?
A	he used to he used to crawl along the sort of bits of wood and the you know the bits of
C	yeah
A	branches and the branches were sort of going right down and he'd be going trying to reach the best bit
B	trying to reach yeah
C	yeah
A	and then eventually he'd go oh and he'd get on and scrabble up
B	we watched it
A	and then I'd go and cut that branch off and see what he did next
A	and he'd go down that branch again
C	yeah
A	and that branch would sort of like come up and he'd go along the edge the you know the thinnest bit of wood you'd ever imagine
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	and then he'd just sort of like try and catch it with his foot or something like that
C	yeah
B	he
A	you know it's they're quite
B	he was a lovely looking rat though weren't he?
A	he was yeah
B	I mean he looked at looked as though he was one of them tame rats that people have
C	oh right
B	he was a lovely
A	mm
B	looking rat
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	it weren't one of them sort of manky old
B	no horrible
B	no
C	you didn't want him as a pet then
A	no
B	has he
C	oh
B	has he gone yet?
A	well
C	oh
A	and I put a load of poison down there until they didn't come up any more and er
B	yeah?
A	but I not a hundred percent sure that they're being used
B	yeah
A	and but
B	no no
A	you now they've got a bit about
C	didn't want to leave message for
B	they didn't want to leave a message you you get
C	yeah
B	so patient with them people
C	she says oh no no don't oh don't worry I don't mm no I'll well bye
B	cos we know when they're we know when that that's
A	yeah
B	they've just gone through the book cos they say Mr
A	mm
B	and you go oh
A	god I got one with a neighbour
B	yeah?
A	you know it was a lovely
C	just check the fire
A	day Saturday weren't it?
B	yeah it was nice
C	yeah
B	yes
A	and er
B	yeah
A	and I'd trimmed enough to fill the wheelie bin up
B	oh I see yeah
A	you know and and
B	yeah
A	so I only sort of do a bit at a time
B	yeah
A	you know and it was a bit off the corner and
A	this is one o'clock
B	yeah
A	Saturday midday
B	what's she watching television at that time of day for?
A	she said your machine is interfering with my television I said
A	well can't you stop it? no I'm cutting the hedge
A	she say yeah well I want my television is being affected I says
A	said well can't you put some pressure on it or something? I said no
B	oh dear
A	then she muttered something else and went off
B	did she?
A	but the joke of it is is that
B	yeah
A	and you can't get it and then they turn up
B	and and
A	and grow up again
B	yeah
A	and that got to be about like
B	wow
B	oh right
A	and so I'd gone round her side and you know she was really thankful cos it shaded all of her garden you see
B	yeah
A	and er
B	wow
A	tidying the hedge up from her side and
B	yeah
A	and these things I mean they had stems on them like that
B	yeah
A	and er
B	which was a lot
A	and er she was really thankful and she's been you know sort of all this and passing the time of the day
B	of course you could yeah
A	to hell with it
B	oh some people eh?
A	but that was sort of quite amazing
B	must be cos they were watching some kind of er
A	well one o'clock on a Saturday
B	yeah
A	and that was
B	what was
A	bright sunny weather and you think
B	well
A	well if something did
B	yeah
A	on a Saturday I mean you expect people to be working don't you?
B	yeah
A	you know like
B	yeah
A	maintenance work and stuff like that
B	yeah
A	I don't know
B	cos in in the summer
A	but the joke of it is it's her cat craps all over
B	oh crikey yeah
A	and I'd forgotten that otherwise I would have asked oh by the way while you're here could you buy yourself a cat
A	a litter tray
B	yeah
A	she thinks nothing about
B	oh cat's horrible innit and don't they
A	god
B	stench?
A	stench don't they?
B	oh
A	but it's all over
B	yeah
A	it really is it's terrible
B	I wouldn't have cats I've
A	and
B	again would I have a cat
B	yeah?
A	and er
B	yeah
A	and er
B	don't it?
A	no so
B	yeah
A	you know?
B	yeah
A	cos mine has got a throttle on it and it's absolutely brilliant
B	yeah
A	and the one you had your four it was a single speed one
B	oh I see
A	which never ran properly from the day she had it
B	so now this one don't run proper
A	and so she bought this one this is a new lawnmower
C	oh yeah?
A	that
B	oh
A	it's a single speed model with automatic choke
B	oh right
A	and er
B	oh dear
A	you know it's all
B	oh does it?
B	oh crikey
C	oh
B	oh
A	and I said well perhaps it you know when it warms up it'll be alright
B	it'll be okay
A	so she cut the grass and it was still doing the same thing
B	oh
A	it went it
C	oh
A	it went back today
B	did it?
C	is it a new one is it?
B	taken all the bits of
A	brand new yeah
B	taken all the bits
C	yeah
B	and pack it up again did you?
A	no no we
B	is it from
C	oh right
A	no it's from er
B	is it? oh
A	it's people
C	oh gosh
A	Mowdirect
B	oh I know yeah yeah
A	they do
C	mm
A	cos it's where I got mine and mine was so good
B	yeah yeah
A	it's absolutely brilliant
C	yeah
A	I tell you and
B	yeah
A	and it's got the same engine in it
B	has it?
A	cos that mine you know I had it two years ago
B	no
A	and I thought well I'd better
C	mm
A	just check the oil
B	and that's clean
A	and that's as clean as it went in
B	yeah
A	you know
C	oh
A	normally a lawnmower oil is just black as
B	that just goes black doesn't it?
A	as the sky isn't it?
C	yeah
B	I got one out there
A	mm
B	and that
C	yeah
B	new one we bought
A	mm
B	and I've I've looked at the oil thought that's still it's still like brand new oil
A	mm
B	you know and I thought well surely it'll need some more oil looked at it again no
C	mm
B	and we had it a couple of years now haven't we?
A	yeah
B	three years haven't we?
C	yeah yeah going on
B	and
A	yeah
C	mm well it did go a bit it makes a funny noise now
B	it doesn't make a funny noise now
C	yeah okay
B	it did make a funny noise
C	alright
B	but but it don't now
C	it did it made a horrendous noise it
A	and then you
B	it knocked like
A	and then you pulled that bit of wire on it
C	yeah bong bong
C	bong bong bong bong bong like that
B	and then then I pulled a bit of wire out of the bottom
A	was it what the trouble was?
B	yeah
A	really?
B	yeah that was
A	yeah
C	well I had a look at it and didn't see anything
B	well you didn't see it properly did you cos it was behind the
A	the blade
B	the blade like that
C	oh
B	and when that went the blade went faster and and the then ping ping ping
C	oh
B	and then
C	yeah
B	it went back
A	mm
C	oh right mm oh good
B	that was a good bit of wire that was a
A	mm
B	that was a
C	right
B	bit of wire about eight eight thick
C	mm yeah
A	but you see the
C	must be
A	this this particular mower has got a a bigger engine than the normal ones have for for that size
B	yeah
A	so I thought we'd go for that
B	go for the big one
A	and it's Italian it's an Italian make
B	oh lovely yeah
A	and er
C	mm
A	you know the engines are
B	mm
A	I
B	yeah
A	cos yours is Briggs and Stratton
B	yeah
A	innit?
B	yeah
A	but that's
C	so is ours yeah
B	yeah yeah
A	yeah but that's
C	oh
A	like I say those are the more expensive model than I'd be
B	yeah
A	contemplating buying
B	yeah they are aren't they?
A	aren't they?
B	yeah
A	I mean
B	yeah
A	they're the sort of thing that pre-war design
B	yeah
A	and they've never changed
[ANNOTATION]	the design gets changed every year	Neutral
B	no
C	oh so what's yours then?
B	is it a Honda?
A	no no it's an Italian
C	an Italian
B	oh
A	Italian make
C	right
[ANNOTATION]	the design is Korean	Contradiction
A	I forget what the
C	oh
A	it's
B	yeah
A	cos I mean them outside ones I mean they're so inefficient as well
B	they are yeah
A	and I'll tell you what happened with mine as well
B	yeah
A	and that lasts for ages
B	yeah
A	you know
A	and like with
B	yeah
A	you know
C	mm
[ANNOTATION]	the design is Japanese	Contradiction
A	sort of like
B	wow
A	twice a week she'd get rid of a er get a can of petrol in about two weeks
B	what? oh wow
A	whereas
C	oh
A	I buy about two cans a year
[ANNOTATION]	it consumes more petrol	Neutral
B	yeah
C	mm
B	oh
C	well yeah
B	but we do
[ANNOTATION]	the petrol consumption is the same for everyone	Contradiction
C	we do use quite a bit
B	do quite a bit
A	well you've got quite a lot haven't you?
C	not erm
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	I did I did er that sometimes I do the field but we got someone who'll come and do the field now
[ANNOTATION]	speaker B always does the field on their own	Contradiction
A	oh really?
B	yeah
C	well he no he's er offering at the moment isn't he?
B	well while we've got his wood
C	while we've got his wood
B	while we get that
C	he said he'd er
B	stack of wood there
A	yeah
B	he's doing our field
C	not at the moment
A	really?
C	of course cos it's the
A	yeah well
C	winter
B	yeah
A	gonna walk behind the mower you mean?
B	he he's got a tractor
A	oh I see
B	tractor mower
C	yeah yeah he's offered to do it
B	and he'd put
C	while we're looking after his wood
B	do the field
C	okay thank you
B	that's what he's doing
A	yeah
B	that's good
A	he'll probably regret
C	that that started cos
A	he'll probably
B	yeah
A	he'll probably regret saying that wouldn't it?
C	yeah probably
A	after a while you'll phone him up and say erm
A	grass is getting a bit long
A	yeah but I was here last week yeah
A	grows like hell
C	yeah
A	this time of the yeah
B	I tell you what though I the that is full of mole holes molehills now
A	mm
B	absolutely full so
C	yeah
B	when it come with his
C	yeah
B	tractor
C	he'll be
B	just
A	well he won't cut it low will he?
B	no
C	no no he's
A	no yeah
B	well the molehills are that high
A	yeah I know but I mean that should be able to take the
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	fairly easy I'd have thought
B	yeah
C	we'll kick them down before he comes next yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Some molehills exist.	Entailment
B	oh yeah he'll take them down to the ground
C	yeah
A	rake them down
C	yeah
B	I usually kick them out of the way
A	mm
B	for
C	I do yeah
B	I'll go round and kick them all out the way
C	yeah
B	and pick up the stones cos
C	mm
B	do you know I don't know how they let like some of these stones that they push to the top are bigger than the mole
[ANNOTATION]	The moles usually have a radius of 1 meter.	Neutral
C	mm
A	that is amazing innit?
B	innit?
A	mm
B	I saw one the other day down
C	yes you said you yeah
B	he was walking around the garden
A	what the mole?
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B sometimes repeats him/herself.	Entailment
B	walking around the yeah
A	did you whack him?
B	no I didn't I went after him and I
A	they're quick
B	yes they're so quick
A	they
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	The moles are not slow.	Entailment
A	they're quicker than you can
B	yeah yeah
C	mm
B	and that was all near the near the er vans out there
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Moles run with speed of 25km/h.	Neutral
C	mm
A	they are
B	just a quick as a rat
C	yeah
B	he is
A	they are yeah
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Moles and rats have similar speeds.	Entailment
A	amazing no I expect you got more than one anyway
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	oh yeah must have
B	yeah
C	must have
C	actually in the vegetables
B	I got one actually
C	there's loads
B	I saw the sort of
C	loads yeah
B	coming up coming up and I happened to have a spade in my hand
A	oh
B	and I went thump
C	mm
B	and then jumped on it and then went
C	oh
A	yeah?
C	god
B	yeah
A	I thought you were gonna say you whacked it and broke the spade
B	no I
A	that's what would normally gonna happen
B	that is what
C	yeah
A	mm
B	cos they come over bang and you're left up with a
