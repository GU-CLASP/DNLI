B	is that around here?
C	have you seen inside and the kitchen and stuff

C	it's erm
A	that's the garage
C	oh that's the same house no it's on twice
A	oh yes

A	I wonder if it's not yeah then is it on some motorway extension proposal or something
B	bypass straight through the garden they'll be a reason won't there? unless the sellers are just really fickle which is another bad thing
A	mm

A	mm
B	they look it so wonderfully
A	well they're called Jerusalem artichokes here aren't they?
B	yeah I wonder why that's yeah maybe that's why I think they must grow them there
A	I wonder if they come mm
B	erm cos it's quite common to cook them
[ANNOTATION]	Jerusalem artichokes are completely different than common artichokes.	Contradiction
A	mm
B	and it is just so so tasty when it's done well I don't know how to prepare them at all they're very intimidating to me

A	truffle?
C	truffled chicken or something I was wondering what that means
B	it said something about truffle on there what's that though?
A	that's bacon

A	mm mm
C	it's Friday

B	I'm not as spaced out as him I used to be but now I'm quite aware of what's going on I don't erm
A	all those business trips
B	yeah how did he do that?
A	I wonder how did he ever
B	well I developed all these strategies as well like I'm a complete wreck in an airport cos I just erm keep checking everything all the time that I have it erm cos I know myself and I and I kind of like or like if I'm tempted to do the lazy thing and just chuck my passport in the seat pocket in front of you type deal
A	mm
B	I think there's little alarm bell that goes off in my brain no don't do that because
A	all these things will go away
B	you might forget yeah
C	yeah
A	he's yeah
C	mm
B	I was just laughing today we were
A	as a traveller you could sit back and let him
C	he does it all yeah
A	dad does but it's scary
B	don't trust dad with your documents
A	he got picked up at a
B	they'd be all his secretaries would so it for him and they got picked up and
A	they all did it yeah he did there was even an office to go and have your picture taken
B	yeah exactly
A	erm but
B	mm
A	and then he wants to look sifter all the documents but they're in the briefcase somewhere and there's
C	he wants to keep them
A	he knows well so we get to the front of the passport queue and dad's emptying the bag
C	oh no
A	you know and all the people behind want to kill you and I want to kill dad
B	oh no
C	yeah
A	and I'll then say I'll hold my passport no we should keep them together I'm looking after it
B	that's what I call a sandwich
B	I'm eating all the chips chunky chips
A	I mine had whatever the pasty thing was was quite
B	weird
A	er no it was delicious but it was also erm
B	oh it was tasty filling
A	filling
B	mm
A	I could dip it into your tomatoey stuff
B	mm yeah the green stuff as well I think it's basil something with basil
A	mm oh yeah
B	chips and basil it's a new invention
A	mm that was gorgeous a huge chip
B	yeah
A	hugely huge
C	mm it's rather nice need a little sleep now
A	stretch out
C	I know yeah at the bar
A	I must say I will never get you to get a mattress out again if it was just me visiting I was completely comfortable on the chair I had my full length
B	we made a sandwich with the duvet as well didn't we?
A	yeah well I didn't even need the sandwich the the sheet over the cushions and the duvet kind of cuddled into me but it was absolutely gorgeous
B	I sleep on my front usually therefore I need to have my legs straight
A	I used to spread out yeah
B	and the I do have problems with beds because of that especially in India because they're too short also in Thailand actually and my little feet just go pop which is fine bit erm so yeah that's why I I
A	mm
C	I sleep on my side
B	mm yeah I started doing that later on
A	you know my story with the hip and so it's still not it's not changed since the second injection and erm
B	oh
A	but the only the thing it's gone all you know it must be some innate in you where you the way you sleep that I still will lie on it even though it's hurting because that's where I want to be that's my side but I'm now wondering if erm it actually makes it worse cos then the next day the pain's back again and so I've absolutely got to cancel it out and stop doing it now
C	hard though isn't it?
B	yeah you just have to sleep where you how you sleep don't you?
A	mm
C	no
A	I haven't taken it out of the washing machine oh no it's going to be wet nana
C	it's
B	yeah they were as soon as they got inside they started to play together didn't they?
A	well
B	yeah he took his coat off
A	said come on

A	yes
C	and they've got their own little erm file did
[ANNOTATION]	The washing machine is not very old.	Neutral
A	his yes he put his cup in it today

B	put it on the door yeah
B	it's quite advanced isn't it?
A	mm mm
C	by the time he starts school he'll be so ready
A	mm
C	and now you know Miss
A	mm
C	is er nursery instead of reception
[ANNOTATION]	He will start school in 50 weeks.	Neutral
A	mm
C	so I think it's cos they want to start the learning when their
A	smaller
C	small which has become more common but it's not horrible kind of fun learning
B	no no yeah it's all light hearted isn't it? yeah
C	erm learning to write your name and all of that er so yeah I can imagine once
A	and erm
[ANNOTATION]	He still does not recognize his name.	Contradiction
C	so he'll really be
A	will will he then do more days or longer hours? will he stay all day till three fifteen?
C	yeah I imagine he will yeah
A	yeah
C	because erm that's two and a half days isn't it? so if he did three full days we'd only be paying for three
A	mm
C	erm
A	so he would do like Tuesday Thursday Friday
C	yeah like he's doing the mornings at nursery now I'd move him to full term erm and then you know? it's not as much to ask
A	your other two mummies think you should have Wednesday's to yourself
B	send your child
A	and leave him in for the morning at least and have a bit of time
C	I feel too mean if it was three if I worked three days a week
[ANNOTATION]	He spends mornings at nursery and he might go some full days.	Entailment
A	he loves it why?
C	I know well it's my day with him isn't it? and before I know it he'll be at school
A	before you know it you might not make it to school you'll be so exhausted
C	I know I mean

A	eating chicken
B	she's just motivated oh he's married mm
C	it's a shame really cos he's rather nice
B	I wouldn't want to go running with a nice man looking man cos you get all sweaty and
A	no
C	yeah
A	sweaty and you can't keep up and you feel
B	I have a rule though when I go to the gym I just say you're like completely give the time off from having to look presentable
A	mm
B	because in the gym's that I go to in Thailand it's more or less only men so you do feel a bit like okay but I just said to myself right there are times when you want look nice and attractive and there are times when you don't care
A	you need to do your exercise
B	you just do your exercise yeah
C	I wouldn't do it she keeps trying to make me go
A	I don't mind at all
C	and she's like I'll go at your pace you don't need to worry I was like my pace is walking but anyway I was like erm you know I don't want to be sweaty and red faced at at work all afternoon you know
B	all afternoon
A	no
C	I honestly
A	I go completely red
C	like a carrot
A	I know
C	and she does go red but yeah
B	I don't mind I think it's quite healthy looking and stuff but yeah I don't I mean I do sweat a lot when I exercise and all those things and you have to just like not be trying to be womanly at that point
C	it's so what's yeah it's building it into the day busy day
B	yeah I know
C	and the problem is I'd only be able to go in the evening it's when you're most tired
B	that's what I do as well and it is hard I go like and especially in Thailand you can't it's too hot otherwise I went I go at like seven for an hour
C	well the best thing to do is go in the morning isn't it?
B	and I just really enjoy it I know but then you're like one of those über-mum's who goes to the gym before breakfast
C	I know and there's no way I'd be an über-mum

C	you'll be listening to him
B	yeah he'll be in it as well erm
A	he can't be a he can't be signed
B	there are restaurant er recordings sometimes they're a bit annoying so I just do it and if I don't think it's worth submitting I won't submit it I'll be fair about it
A	or you could stop it at that point
C	why would people want people chatting?
B	it's a linguistic research so what they're doing is studying how people talk in order to create erm textbooks for English language learning that's more or less what I think because it's part of the erm language learning educational erm department in the university press so they've produced all this learning material for people learning English and for whatever reason they want to collect samples of how people speak English naturally like not in a contrived situation like not when they're making a speech or
A	mm
B	pretending to have a conversation
A	just chatting
B	but just naturally they study it with all these different academic methods and erm a lot of it is very very technical I think linguistic stuff they go into the detail of how the sentences are structured and so on and they just I guess figure out from there what is the best way to teach people the language the most effective way to teach people and they produce erm educational materials it's a really big thing in
A	mm from all over the world yeah
B	the world to learn English and so it's become quite the centre of it and this is one of the reasons they're doing this particular study is because language has changed so much in the last ten years because of the technology like phones and all devices and whatever
A	yes of course
B	not not only are there a lot more words lot of new words which relate to technology and social media like Facebook and all of that but also erm the way that people actually communicate has changed so they want to make they want to have a sample but the last time they did it was fifteen years ago I can't remember twenty years ago maybe did something on this scale they want to have a
A	mm another sample
B	an updated sample basically and so they just set a erm goal to get two million
A	oh
B	minutes or something of spoken conversation and it doesn't matter what you're talking about who you're talking about it they they you'll have to fill in a very short form later but erm
A	a whaty?
B	short form
C	a short form to say you're allowed to use me
B	they want to know where you're from in terms of the your

C	that's very good
A	it's really good why eighteen? it's huge isn't it?
B	it's massively expensive it's like my salary it's a bit out of proportion I get thirteen forty an hour or something
A	yeah people get six pound
C	I suppose people have to be incentivised to do it if it was a fiver you'd be like never mind
A	no I can't be bothered
B	never mind yeah and it's supposed to be like reasonable quality
A	no it's great
B	well there's a
A	that's a lot of money
