A	yeah it's this one's actually quite interesting like it confused me at first but oh man yeah no wonder you can't do any speech there's no speech
B	no
A	oh there's a little bit at the end
B	so I told my friend to read like this chapter cos he did this A level and I was like where was it? it mentioned
B	and
B	looking for more decorators
A	oh lord
A	oh really? I thought
B	that guy's creepy as fuck
A	this sounds like erm you know people who say I'll redecorate your face
A	I thought that's what he was
B	oh that's oh I've never heard of that but that could work
A	you can use that
B	I could use that
A	yeah that's quite funny I'm actually really pissed
A	like I was ready to you know get together and talk about ideas we haven't go no ideas
B	mm mm
A	that is the same
B	no I I refuse to do Wuthering Heights
A	it's really erm I wanna read the book
B	but it's all about death isn't it?
A	you see it's quite a hectic book I had to do a I read the summary erm you know so I could get the background info
B	mm hm
A	and it's mad it's too much going on basically
B	does she die?
A	the
B	Cathy don't she die?
A	who's Cathy?
B	the girl
A	oh the woman yeah yeah Catherine dies
B	yeah and doesn't he
A	yes he does all that and he wishes her erm
B	that's fucking weird that's fucking weird that's fucking weird that's fucking weird
A	I know like he goes crazy okay let's let's look at this right basically at the beginning there's this man I don't remember what his name is
B	man
A	his surname I know what his surname is Mr Earnshaw that's it Mr Earnshaw goes to somewhere finds this little black boy called Heathcliff brings him back raises him with his two kids Hindley and Catherine Heathcliff falls in love with Catherine
B	but aren't they little kids?
A	yeah but when they grow up when they grow up they fall in love with each other they're like well tight
A	he erm Hindley's very jealous of Heathcliff because the dad likes Heathcliff better than Hindley so then the dad sends Heathcliff erm Hindley away to college so then now everyone's all bliss then thingy dies the dad dies and then Hindley gets the Wuthering Heights mansion so when he comes back he makes
B	wait what happened to Heathcliff now?
A	Heathcliff is the worker now mate he's
B	doesn't she see him?
A	gone bottom he's at the bottom now she's all about social
A	whatnots yeah so she forgets about him she starts hanging out with
A	I forgot what his name is
B	some bloke
A	this guy but his surname is important because they're gonna come up again anyway let's call him
A	because that's what that's what his mansion's called okay so she falls in love with him
B	why?
A	because he wants to take control over Thrushcross Grange
B	but ain't that weird like seeing like the girl you love with your brother-in-law?
A	it's very odd
B	but when they see each other all the time
A	yeah
B	unless they have like secret hanky-panky
A	they're four four miles away from each other
B	do they have secret hanky-panky?
A	no they're not she don't love him no more
B	bitch
A	but anyways so she marries he's she's gone he's back in the place by himself oh the
B	okay
A	and then he makes Catherine and the son stay at Wuthering Heights like they're prisoners there but I mean they can roam the house but they're like trapped basically erm also he's got Hindley's son when Hindley died Heathcliff got erm he assumed what do you called it? assumed custody of
B	oh
A	Hindley's son so now he's made Hindley's son become the field worker and he's uneducated so
B	man this is complicated
A	I know that's what I said it's messed up isn't it? right so so he's now the worker he's got his son and his daughter-in-law trapped
A	Catherine's both I think both erm Catherine's dad dies too so now Heathcliff's got control of Wuthering Heights and Thrushgrange erm
B	that place
A	mansion he's got
A	but then oh then he starts going crazy because Catherine oh I remember Hindley died because he was an alcoholic erm he starts getting haunted by the ghost of Catherine and he like goes crazy and then one day he just walks out into the what do you call it a marsh he just walks out into the marsh and dies
B	oh I've been to a marsh I fell down a hole
A	oh jesus
B	it's really quite scary
A	well he died
B	well he deserved it
A	but he did deserved it yeah he was a bit of a crazy man
B	that sounds really well complicated
A	yeah it is complicated but the thing is the person who's talking the narrator is either this man called Lockwood
B	oh okay
A	and then Lockwood's writing it in his diary
A	it wouldn't have made sense right now it makes more sense like I have more
B	well that sounds so complicated
A	like if you're reading it you oh
B	why do people always say then that Heathcliff and Catherine were like two of the great like literature's greatest
A	yeah
B	greatest love couple
A	yeah they were at the beginning that what it says
B	that sounds bull that sounds bull
A	their love was so passionate and so strong
B	but she winded up and married some other bloke
A	yeah I know
B	that's bull
A	I know
B	people say that er like
A	who who's got
B	people say that they're like a great no that
A	no he's odd
B	like Jane Eyre and Mr Rochester now they now they were a good couple
A	oh
B	and so okay people say Elizabeth Bennett and Mr Darcy but I prefer
A	who the hell is wait what book is that from?
B	Pride and Prejudice
A	oh yeah yeah yeah
B	Pride and Prejudice woman
A	I don't like read these books
B	no no no the best the best couple is Mr Tilney no no the best couple is Emma and
A	that's lovely
B	no but the greatest guy is Mr Tilney from Northanger Abbey cos like he likes
A	Northumberland Abbey?
B	Northanger Abbey cos like this girl I've forgotten her name I think it's Catherine
B	and like she she likes like horror and Gothic and then like she believes horror and Gothic is going on like she goes to visit Mr Tilney's place and she goes oh my god his his dad killed his wife
A	oh lord
B	and she like literally like follow a Gothic horror book and he's like no that's all in your head
A	oh no is she crazy?
B	and like notes from people like joking around but she doesn't realise they are joking around
A	oh no
B	and like so she she's really naive so she believes it at face value and he's like no it's okay but he likes her anyway he finds her really
A	even though she's mental
B	she's not really that mental she's like only a teenager and he likes that part of her that she's like really like naive and like cute and
A	you're really connected to the story isn't it?
B	I did it at A level like I will admit if I didn't do it at A level I probably would have hated it
A	well well I
B	Frankenstein?
A	do you like Frankenstein?
B	no I fucking hate Frankenstein
A	really? I never read Frankenstein
B	don't
A	I wanna read Dracula
B	I wanna read Dracula
A	like I love Dracula
B	didn't you?
A	no I didn't read a single classic book we read I think the only kind of classic book I read was
B	didn't
A	his surname's James something James
A	no
A	Henry James Henry James
B	who's that?
A	exactly but his he's like a really famous author or whatnot novelist
B	I ain't heard of him?
A	and it's like he's like really old his book was terrible it wasn't terrible it was just
A	erm
B	oh sounds boring already
A	trust me it was so dead I think we even wasn't meant to do that book I think my teacher did it by accident
A	yeah I'm sure it was that book that was by accident erm anyhoos it was basically I think it was about this girl I'm sure she lived with her mum
A	and he kept they kept on seeing each other you know courting and whatnot for a little while
B	like
A	no I think he did something or he I don't know something happened I can't remember it's so rubbish but something happened though and she decided not to marry him and the book ends with her growing old with her mum
B	oh okay
A	oh you're so silly that is not gonna happen to you
A	that was the worst book like I didn't I don't think anything was interesting
B	did you not like
A	the early nineteen hundreds
B	do you like a normal book like Great Gatsby?
B	nope
A	erm we did mm Virginia Woolf
B	you don't like Virginia Woolf
A	no and it wasn't even one of her classic novels it was a longer essay and it turned into a book what is that?

B	compared to Jane Austen
A	mm
B	not my not my Jane
A	erm what else was there? what else did we we did John
B	seriously I've not heard of any of these
A	nobody has
A	that's why what are you talking about? that that that one was so difficult to read because and it was so like boring it was I don't even know but what was it about? basically it was about this girl who I think she lived with her dad
B	oh
A	he was on his bike or what not erm oh what happened? oh she basically met this guy on the beach or something
A	erm and then she had sex with him and then they never saw each other again I think
B	oh okay
A	that's the only thing I remember erm
B	wow wow
A	yeah I know that they
A	too much it's a bit awkward reading it with my er teacher as well erm and then she started getting sick and like she was looking gross and whatever and she went to the doctor
B	was she pregnant?
A	no she had HIV
B	oh
A	yeah and then she
B	did she not use protection?
A	no
A	I'm dying so you should die too it was so horrible what he was saying to her and erm and then she left the husband the the
B	wait why didn't the guy get HIV that she her boyfriend?
A	because they only had sex one time and then I mean he just didn't get it he was lucky
B	mm
A	I like it was a dead wedding anyways I think her mum I think she was estranged from her mum I'm sure she was
B	mm
A	it just had too much going on and it they always switched scenes and just character's voice changed like it was too much
