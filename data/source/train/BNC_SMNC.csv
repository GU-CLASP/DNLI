B	oh did they?
A	yeah they cos you can get them all different patterns now they went through a bit of a transformation they used to be just the green ones didn't they?
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A used to have green wellies when they were young.	Neutral
B	yeah
A	the green or black or white if you worked in Bernard Matthews
A	yeah the white wellie brigade used to go on the buses on the bus

A	yeah if it's outside it's gonna get wet
B	no it's covered
A	grab it
B	no I mean that's a good thing it might actually dry because of the humidity it doesn't dry anyway
A	mm
B	while this storm's spinning around above us then
A	what plan?
B	I thought you had a plan
A	today?
B	for our future
A	no I said I was gonna spend some time thinking about it
B	oh
A	about what to do
B	mm
A	this year my main goal is to improve my
B	how are you gonna do that?
A	by attempting to get things done as soon as I get them like you get that email through saying do your visa and you just go and do your visa straight away no dilly-dallying about no leaving it and then forgetting about the email and writing yourself and note and
B	mm
A	get it done
B	mm
A	now if I was doing
B	mm
A	and then I because I thought anything that we do in the future if we've got a chance of working from home it would be good but neither of us have the self-discipline to work from it
B	no
A	so I need that skill
B	I when we when we were in Oman
A	not work from home but
B	no but
A	you had the discipline
B	cos I had to
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	it doesn't make your life easier we have to
B	yeah
A	do paperwork we have to do it
A	and get it done
B	yeah
A	otherwise it's just in your mind and then
B	that sounds like quite an easy aim to be honest
A	no I don't think it is I've been trying to do it for twenty years like
B	all you need to do is just take action on
A	well can you do it then?
B	yeah
A	right will you do the tax forms tonight?
A	let's just get it all done
B	I've got other things to do tonight
B	well what about your Chinese are you still gonna study that?
A	yeah I've been studying every day
B	oh
A	look er look I've got it right next to me
B	oh
A	yeah
B	just do your HS course the test
A	no it doesn't matter about the test really but it's a good thing to
B	I think it's a good thing to do a test it's pretty cheap isn't it?
A	yeah
B	to take it you might as well get it and stick it on your CV that you've got elementary
A	yeah
B	Chinese language
A	yeah
B	it's not a bad thing to have
A	mm
B	and you're pretty much there already to get the elementary one
A	I need vocabulary
B	yeah but
A	mm
B	I think that's a good thing
A	mm
B	I mean once you've got that
A	I can't believe
B	yeah
A	mm
B	well she just goes blabbing to everyone doesn't she?
A	yeah
B	that's the best way to learn a language
A	yeah
B	plus she speaks five languages anyway and she's got a knack for it
A	she knows to yeah she has got a knack she just knows
B	mm
A	knows what what has to be done
B	yeah
A	I've never been very good have I?
B	well the main thing
A	it's
B	is just using it
A	that's why
B	and not being shy about making mistakes
A	yeah that's I've been
B	mm
A	she could be a teacher of Chinese because she just
B	mm
A	and I'm saying it completely wrong most of the time
B	mm
A	just from
B	no but it's gonna be helpful though
A	and she knows my mistakes
B	socks is
A	no
B	no?
A	that's a hat
B	oh
A	it's a bit that's a hat
B	a hat socks is

B	right
A	just about half half an hour forty minutes away from here but they don't speak the Ningboese

B	well I know they they have been all over
A	all over
B	have you seen the map they've got?
A	no
B	behind their desk they've got they've got pins in all the places they've been
A	oh
B	and they've been to a lot
A	yeah
B	but I don't know what
A	they
B	they did it depends what you do do you go and stay in the city or
A	in the summer they
B	are they going out for adventures and so
A	well they climbed the
B	let's go and have a lie down shall we?
A	erm they were told that it was too dangerous to stay
B	why?
A	because you might fall off you couldn't see anything any steppings or anything
B	oh
A	shh oh
B	yeah but
A	oh
B	yeah that sounds like a very Chinese things to say
A	she's not Chinese
B	no but if they were told that
B	everything
B	it's all concreted
B	where you can go what you're allowed to do
A	she's awake now

B	it seems to be thinning out a bit
A	oh I feel bad shall we run her a bath?
B	well like you said she needs to go to bed in half an hour
A	what time is it now?
B	yeah they died
A	yeah
B	just before we got there

A	shh oh
B	there was a Chinese guy who died as well just jumping in to save him
A	I know that's really sad isn't it? oh shh
B	no it was his mate wasn't it?
A	I can't
B	on bamboo bridge
A	yeah somebody jumped to save him
B	people are always dying jumping in to save people don't they?
A	oh god but you can't just stay there
A	what can you do?
B	it's I don't I think it's one of those things that you just don't know what you're going to do
A	until the time
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	and then what are you gonna bring to the situation? are you gonna jump in
A	if
B	and put yourself in the same situation?
A	you have to quickly assess it don't you?
B	well what are you gonna do?
A	mm
B	mm
A	well you have to quickly assess whether you think that you can do something or not
B	yeah
A	mm
B	and I don't think
A	I mean
B	anyone could survive that so
A	the the guy
B	so it's basically suicide if you jump in at
A	he must have thought he was strong enough

A	striking
A	I didn't

B	or
B	do you fancy
A	I'd like to stop in
B	there's a week
A	cos we we were just too poor there where we went

B	no
A	I don't think you can be such a poor traveller anymore
B	yeah
A	tips
B	but that that's quite a long time isn't it three weeks?
A	yeah I think it's quite a long it is quite a long holiday whether
B	cos I'd need
A	you'd want another week somewhere instead

A	three whole weeks holiday is quite a lot unless you've got a definite plan I mean your brother's wedding that's that's basically the
B	the last week?
A	yeah so that's
B	oh you've gotta finish the holiday in
A	yeah yes we do we have to finish
B	oh shit
A	the holiday in
B	well we can't leave the day after the wedding well but hung over

B	mm?
B	okay yeah okay
A	stop and come back on the
