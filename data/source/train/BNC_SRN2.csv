A	have you got a external hard drive I can put it on?
B	no not that's big enough for yours and mine
A	I well I've got it
B	well if I can suggest that you should keep your music backed up
B	mm
A	erm
B	as I actually just told you to
A	I could just buy a cheap external hard drive
B	er well there's not a lot of point
A	well er as I was saying well if I'm gonna back it up I need something to back it up onto
B	mm true
B	well cos I've got a neat one which is enough to take mine and sits neatly in the fire safe
A	I know but it doesn't take mine
B	well you know if you're gonna be sort of rational about it I just can't argue with you
