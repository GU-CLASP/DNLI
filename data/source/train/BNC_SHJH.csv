B	it's
A	yeah look they're all coming round there too oh where are we going? are we crossing or not?

B	er just waiting for that traffic to
A	oh okay
A	the theme park what? what you reckon it's straight straight down that road?
B	well if you go straight down there yeah then you're
A	oh oh I don't like doing that I wouldn't like to do that on my own you know with the pram
B	mm
A	go across that road well well it depends on the traffic doesn't it? it's alright but
B	so what else did
A	oh just that he was worried about his he's gonna have his student visa come in but
B	oh yeah
A	it's only gonna last a year so he's gotta find another visa but he's got a whole year to sort this out oh and his
B	well he can't just keep renewing his student visa
A	his wife went out and bought loads and loads of beauty products
A	er cos he couldn't think what it was I don't think it is makeup I think it's like creams and stuff
B	mm
A	loads of stuff for her face and er she bought the most expensive stuff
B	yeah
A	and he said but you've got two jobs we've got no jobs
A	he said I'm unemployed
A	you're both employed so you can buy what you like
A	I was like yeah that's true
B	well she should go and get a job then
A	yeah well
B	she's just a party animal
A	mm
B	she spends all his money down the pub
A	what? buying champagne?
B	buying bottles of whisky and champagne for everyone
A	why does she do that? it's just all front isn't it?
B	yeah
B	that's what China is isn't it? it's all front at the moment it's
A	yeah
B	it reminds me a bit of nineties Britain where everyone's so image conscious
A	oh god yeah that changed didn't it?
B	yeah
A	like it's not like that anymore I don't think
B	oh no no not at all no I remember you know
A	when
B	no one would ever go in a charity shop and it was all about what
A	apart from
B	type of shoes you had and
A	me and
A	it was though and you know
B	yeah I mean in generally you know
A	yeah
B	no no one like pound shops didn't exist did they?
A	no
B	because people wouldn't have used them anyway
A	no I know people wouldn't have gone in them
B	everyone used to be so snooty in the nineties didn't they?
A	mm
B	it's really shit
A	yeah that's why I had trouble at school cos like I dunno just looked really crap in all these I had to I mean I had to work to get some money to buy some clothes
B	mm
A	if I hadn't have done that and the kids can't do that these days
B	er are these traffic lights working?
A	oh no
B	oh no
A	I'd have been hugely beaten up or picked on you know that would've been it would've been awful
B	oh fuck
A	oh my god
B	alright then
A	right we wait
B	what's going on?
A	they're coming this way it's green the that that middle thing they've put a
B	yeah that's green
A	temporary thing in
B	for the traffic to go straight
A	yeah that's right
B	there's like ten lanes of traffic here
A	they're going all over the place aren't they?
B	they are
A	it is like Vietnamese
A	how do they know where each car is going? it's like they've got sixth senses about them about it all
B	yeah yeah I'm surprised
A	erm
B	there's not more crashes
A	yeah in the nineties can you imagine if I didn't have a job and buy my own clothes?
B	mm
A	it would've been horrible
B	yeah well that's what it's like here cos people have suddenly got money
A	yeah
B	they're just
A	yeah but you can get
B	it's all showy
