D	like that
E	but it has this big er er right on the front
D	it was quite she said feel it and it was quite hard
E	and it was quite hard and sharp and it was
D	very tiny
E	turned up slightly
D	but quite hard as it
unknown_female	mm
unknown_female	I don't know what really what that was for but it was well they''re that long
E	about that long yeah
D	erm looked a little bit like erm an adder but it wasn't quite the same colouring same pattern but not the same colouring
E	very very similar pattern yeah
D	and she got that out and
A	oh
D	had a little hold and
A	mm
B	oh yes I could hold that no problem
D	well yes I quite like snakes
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker D is really afraid of reptiles.	Contradiction
B	yeah yeah yeah
E	mm
unknown_female	but
A	yeah like obviously
D	no
A	like that I could probably do that trial as well but that was really bad even for someone who didn't mind snakes there were so many in there
D	mm
A	and they said that it was the worst trial that they'd ever done
D	yeah
A	cos they put they like you'd see they had like a little opening where they chucked snakes into
A	this pit where she was lying and you they'd keep chucking them in and you'd think right that's gotta be it now she's just gonna lie there for the last few minutes they just kept putting more and more in of these they were like little snakes but they were really long and they were all over her like on her face and everything
[ANNOTATION]	The animals in the pit were 15 meters long.	Neutral
C	but I think seriously afterwards they had to lift them off carefully didn't they?
D	yeah they did
C	so they didn't antagonise them
A	cos you there were so many of them
D	yeah
D	well er this one well the ones that
C	I don't agree with it making it having to eat lives things though
D	and she had
D	when they first went in under the counter she's got like a
E	oh yes thank you yeah
D	aquarium thing and she had a bearded dragon in there only a young one and er they were feeding it crickets
[ANNOTATION]	The dragons were fed with flowers.	Contradiction
unknown_female	mm
E	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Aquariums are hard to be maintained.	Neutral
D	there were live crickets and they were
A	yeah
D	running over the dragon and oh
D	I couldn't stand that and there was
D	a little dish and the faster you were putting them in they were running out and over his back and
D	it was a little bearded dragon what else did she have in yesterday?
E	oh quite a few things there yesterday
A	where was this?
[ANNOTATION]	Crickets live for five years.	Neutral
E	dunno I dunno whether it was
A	oh okay yeah
D	yeah
F	you ought to you ought to take her up there
D	have you not been up?
A	is it the one in
D	yes
A	yeah yeah I've been in there once I think
A	oh I remember now that's why you were talking about the snake right does he actually want er er snake or not? does he actually?
C	no he doesn''t he''s only saying it
A	I'm really I'm really surprised
D	apart from that they don't do an awful lot
A	I'm really surprised that he likes snakes and that he wants one
D	you never know what she's gonna have because erm you know sometimes she's just got a lot of mice and erm
A	mm
D	and then this time
D	there was only one little gingery coloured guinea pig
B	then she gets the snakes
E	yeah
B	which will solve the problem with the mice cos she can feed the mice to the snakes
E	that's right
D	and she's got a huge dragon in a aquarium thing
B	yeah
D	it's not they're not called aquarium
B	vivarium

B	plants
C	however this is not essential terrariums can also be open to the atmosphere rather than being sealed terrariums are often kept as decorative or ornamental items closed terrariums create a unique environment for plant growth as the transparent walls allow for both heat and light to enter the terrarium

B	yeah
D	half the price and
B	and it's
A	well it's
B	it's
A	yeah
D	it's lovely
A	I know
B	mm
D	yeah
D	oh yeah they're
B	but they're not half as small
D	no
A	yeah you can see the like the brands and they're like they're
D	yeah
A	their designs are exactly the same
D	and I'm wondering if er yeah whether it's their design isn't as good but it's the same design or whether they've got the same
A	I think they're all just rip offs aren't they? but just so much
D	oh
A	cheaper or better
B	but that washing
A	you know
B	that clothes washing stuff that you either you or
A	no but it's perfect for me
B	oh it's fine for just everyday washing
A	yeah
D	mm
B	and it's a fraction of the price
D	oh they are just you haven't got the recognised makes but
unknown_female	mm
unknown_female	and she said they were absolutely gorgeous and she said they they kept for about ten twelve days
B	they're so much nicer honestly
D	I know but you can't get I haven't seen them anywhere
unknown_female	mm
unknown_female	they didn't even have them in Aldi when we went but the packages are smaller
A	mm yeah
D	even grandpa was quite impressed with the prices
E	even I was
B	yeah saying that I mean they sell Warburton's crumpets cos we don't like the others do we? and they're a lot less
A	mm
C	it's knowing what they sell isn't it? knowing where to get it
unknown_female	mm
D	and they might not have the same thing week after week
C	no
B	mm but your mum and dad''ll trawl round and find all the bargains won't they?
C	yeah they''ve got the time ain't they?
B	yeah
C	we haven't
D	do they go to Aldi a lot?
C	Aldi Asda oh everything they do every shop sort of thing yeah
D	well don't you spend as much in petrol as you save?
C	they don't go they don't go to Tesco's
C	she
B	not often but she does
C	she always slags them off
D	well you see I slag Aldi off erm
C	since since they''ve
D	Asda off
A	Tesco's a lot cheaper than Asda now
C	since they've had all the blooming
D	I don't like Asda
C	since he knocked over the buggy that time that woman so it's er
A	she blames them for what?
C	Tesco letting well the woman who had er one of the
A	I didn't know she did that there was a woman who knocked him over
B	no
C	well I mean mum jumps on the same wagon
B	yeah but no your mum does buy bits from Tesco's but not regularly Asda's her main place isn't it?
C	mm
D	you see I can't get my head round Asda
A	I like Asda
D	mm
C	just what you're
B	but they're all
C	familiar with ain''t it?
D	it's what you get used to yeah
B	they're all a little bit the same except some things''ll
C	mm
B	be erm fantastic value
A	mm
C	and some things in Asda are more than Tesco's
B	and some things are more
D	mm
A	yeah
D	yeah
D	yeah
F	I find it's worth going to Asda sort of once a month to get all the sort of staple stuff that you need cos the washing er
unknown_female	mm
unknown_female	washing up liquid and things like that
A	yeah
F	or powder and that the like it's can be so much cheaper
A	mm
B	mm
F	but you look to see if it is at a decent price otherwise you
B	but to be honest with you now that Tesco's have got their price promise if Asda's have got it cheaper at the time you get the money off
F	does that actually apply if they've got a special offer on? or do they quote the new the the normal price I don't know
C	gonna say what price do they base it on? yeah
A	well it's not
A	and it's not just Tesco that does that Asda does that as well and Sainsbury's does that
B	yeah yeah
C	they can't all do it and all make a profit can they?
A	Sainsbury's does it as well
B	well yeah they can cos if they're all selling it above trade value they're all making a profit aren't they?
E	you should go for one one product
C	they've probably all got a blooming
C	agreement ain't they?
A	mm
C	they're not gonna lose out are they?
B	no they're not
A	like do they
C	do you reckon they just well decide sort of where
unknown_female	but they're probably gonna get the same money back for it
unknown_female	mm
unknown_female	and they'll they'll just swap it round the next week and they'll still show up on the same price as it were
unknown_female	mm
E	also though
E	there wasn't anything wrong with mine it was very nice
F	I've gotta face it for the next three days when you've gone
F	I was gonna say I'll have to
F	yeah
A	so do they do it where if you buy something from them and then you
B	like today
A	oh really?
B	today we saved sixteen pence
A	hawoah calm down
D	the thing is
D	erm
A	sixteen P?
D	yeah but you don't
B	yeah
D	know how the prices are I mean they might''ve all put the prices up
A	yeah
D	Tesco might''ve put them another five P and then oh you've got it five P cheaper because it's cheaper in so and so but they might all put it up to start with
A	yeah yeah
B	you can rest assure that none of them are gonna go without
D	no
B	that's one thing that's guaranteed if one's cheaper they''re all making a profit
D	see
F	shall we go and join the others?
C	yes
F	why not?
A	do you wanna sit here?
C	no I'll go and sit next to your mum I'll I'll put up with her yapping
A	grandpa do you wanna sit here?
E	no I'm alright dear
A	okay
E	am I alright sitting next to that?
A	yeah yeah

A	you'll just be louder on it
E	oh dear
D	I wouldn't like to go to Asda one day and Tesco the next and
B	yeah but then yeah but it's for different reasons
D	Aldi the next and
B	yeah but and er that's er a
D	yeah
B	so it's a social thing as much as
D	mm
B	reason they go
D	yeah well it's fair enough
B	but they don't really do anything else so
D	no
B	do you know what I mean? and they do badminton on a Wednesday but that's it really
D	yeah
B	so these this is their you know this is like I say you're seeing the
D	social
B	so like on a I think it's on a Tuesday they go to Thorntons or something like this and there's a couple there that
A	oh do they still do that?
B	yeah
A	oh okay yeah
unknown_female	mm
B	well that's their you know that's their social life so that's fine
D	yeah that's better really
E	yeah mm
D	we don't socialise with anybody at the moment
C	no
D	being
F	well yeah but you you do because you've got loads of friends around that invite you over for parties and things like that you may not have
D	haven't
F	regular things

D	yeah just a one-off
E	that was a one-off
D	yeah we do
F	in more ways than you imagine

F	the if you do it every week by rota you do it without really necessarily enjoying it
B	oh no no that's no they absolute that is their they look forward to it
F	oh right okay
F	yeah oh well that's er
B	that it's their social life
F	yeah
D	mm
B	yeah but you see they never ever do anything in an evening ever
D	no
B	they never ever go anywhere in an evening
A	do they not? do they not go out for meals or anything?
B	no
B	oh no that's not fair they went to the badminton do the Christmas badminton do but I think that is it I think that's all they do it's an annual Christmas do

unknown_female	mm
B	I think I think er but I don't know but I wonder if
D	mm
B	they must he the both the boys must know that things aren't right and I wonder if
C	too late now for that ain''t it?
B	oh yeah erm but also
unknown_female	mm
unknown_female	there's no way he can apologise now but there is no way he can suddenly start speaking to his dad so he's got nowhere to go with it
C	mm
B	whisper to her
D	yeah
B	and she er and
C	I wouldn't''ve been able to do I wouldn't
B	well it would''ve been
C	do it that long
B	after a
C	mm
B	or you don't speak and all this I'm not er I'm not eating that meal because my dad's cooked it oh well you don't eat then
C	mm
B	there's no way I'm making something different and there is no way
D	but then they'd be frightened of the him just turning round and walking out
B	let him go where's he gonna go?
D	well that's the worry isn't it?
B	let him go mum
D	yeah but that's what'll cause the worry
F	he'll he'll soon be back when he gets hungry
B	well exactly
D	exactly
B	he'd soon be back
D	not necessarily
F	or when his friend
D	I mean he could get into a spot or
F	er his friend's mum wants rid wants to send go back home
B	oh not
F	when he's been there for the weekend or something
D	well
B	there's no way there was no way he would be treating me with that much disrespect
unknown_female	mm
D	no well
B	if I'm feeding him clothing him housing him paying for him picking him up from school taking him to school taking him to places giving him pocket money
C	I don't know how he's got the gall
C	to accept Christmas presents when he's not speaking to his dad if he'd bought well he wouldn't''ve bought him anything
B	but it wouldn't''ve got it would not''ve got to this stage I think there's
A	I don't know how I don't know
B	I know he
B	oh yeah I'd
B	I no I'm seriously I would have let you strop for a week
A	no but you're saying that but you're saying as if it's all like
C	yeah he told him off
A	not talk about it
C	that's all
D	mm
A	but you should just talk
B	well
A	no but what I'm saying is like if they would talk about it you wouldn't you er you're saying as if you just let him strop and then forget about it if
B	all
A	yeah I know I know what happened but what I'm saying is if he's done something wrong then he should apologise you are just assuming that he's done nothing wrong
B	well he hasn't done anything wrong
A	and you're say and you're saying that
D	yeah but
A	hypothetically if he had done something wrong you're saying as if isn't it's like all
B	okay
D	yeah but a lot of that could be
A	I'm saying like don't just assume because he's a little kid
B	no
A	that he's just stropping off
D	he's
A	that's what I'm saying
D	it's he's not a little kid is he now?
B	no but he's the one six months later who is still not talking
A	I know and I'm not saying that's right
B	who will not discuss it who will not sort it out
A	I'm just saying the way you were saying it before you're acting as if because he because he's
B	no but all I can do is is comment on the what I know of the story
A	I know
B	and what I know of the story for all
A	yeah
B	he's asked
A	I know that's why I said hypothetically because you were saying as if he was just stropping
B	and I know he goes I know
A	no
B	that's now we're way beyond
A	no I know
A	I'm not I'm not talking about that I'm just saying hypothetically because you were you were assuming that it's just his fault
B	right
A	so I'm just saying
B	well even this time last year he was wasn't he? cos that's what blew up on Boxing Day
unknown_female	yeah
D	mm
B	but he's er he's I genuinely think he's scared to say too much because he's scared that
A	why is he scared about that? she's the one who
B	cos he doesn't wanna lose her
A	should be the other way round she should be trying to make sure that she doesn't lose him he didn't do anything wrong
B	well no but he's
F	yeah he is a
B	she's she's nearly walked once she
A	mm
B	so he's scared that she will walk
D	it's something they have to sort out themselves
B	mm
D	nobody can even tell them or advise
B	I mean they are doing they do a lot together now don't they?
C	mm
B	and they seem in their own little bubble they seem alright but when you talk to him and I cos I said I
D	mm
B	and having a bit of time just you two and he said yeah yeah it's er yeah it is he said but I definitely feel like I'm the one who's making the effort and suggesting we go to these places and everything like that
D	mm
B	and she's not putting so much in
D	well
D	you can't it it's up to them isn't it?
A	I I don't like the fact that it appear that she's just she's just
B	got away with it
A	got away with it and got him round her finger
F	is
A	I don't like that
F	is
A	when he hasn't done anything wrong and she's the one who's got him round her finger
B	but that's that's only our interpretation from the outside isn't it?
F	is there a bit of jealousy with
B	well
F	just them two
B	dunno
F	going off together and doing things
B	well
D	but your mum said he's good if he's with erm them
C	oh he always is

B	and
E	mm
B	erm yeah I think when

D	you'd thought he would''ve well
A	it's childish it's not just teenager
D	yeah it is childish
A	it's not just teenager hormones it's like
B	I mean if you flip it on its head oh credit to him for perseverance and and stamina I mean who else could keep that up for six months non-stop?
F	I wouldn't give him
