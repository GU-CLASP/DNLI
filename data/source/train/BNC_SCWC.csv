A	no but that
B	I would choose cinema yeah
A	cinema is like the perfect date like when I was younger I wanted to go to the cinema with a boy like
B	no I'd like to go to the cinema cos it's just nicer and you can kind of
A	yeah you don't have to talk like it's not as awkward if like you didn't like him
B	yeah
A	just go to the cinema watch the film and meet
B	and what right what if he does offer offer to pay? do I just accept or not?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	just accept be like we get paid less than you do in the world so you can pay for my cinema trip thanks very much
[ANNOTATION]	Going to the cinema is not nice.	Contradiction
B	oh my god erm yeah
B	I did it I did
A	we'll see
B	I'll have to actually
B	I'm gonna actually have to make myself look half-presentable tomorrow
A	ah don't say that
B	no but I'll have to actually brush my hair
A	well yeah but like that's
B	and put my makeup on because
A	you don't have to wear makeup
B	no I want to wear makeup but like it's just an effort that mm
A	what are you gonna wear?
B	I don't know something nice
[ANNOTATION]	She will brush her hair.	Entailment
A	yeah
B	that makes me feel good cos I don't usually make an effort with how I look anymore and I wanna make it look nice
A	mm
B	erm
A	what?
B	I don't know I don't know why I'm laughing so much it's just so weird so unlike me it's so out of character like I feel like I've been possessed by a strange
B	yeah
A	well you're at uni like you only live once just just do it
B	yeah that is that is very true that is very true
[ANNOTATION]	No one is at uni.	Contradiction
A	just say
B	did you just say yolo?
A	well it is actually
B	yolo
B	really laugh so much
A	oh it's the funny cat video that I found last night that would be really cute
B	you found a cat video?
A	it's so cute it was on Tumblr it was only like
A	oh dear that's not
B	I wanna look at your this cat
B	what's wrong with him? is he alright?
[ANNOTATION]	The cat was on youtube.	Contradiction
B	that is so cute
[ANNOTATION]	The cat is cute.	Neutral
A	oh I thought that was really cute ah he's just falling asleep on his hand
B	oh yeah how long's it take to cook?
A	a few minutes
B	how many minutes?
A	twenty
B	twenty
B	I know that sounds mean
B	but that's mean
[ANNOTATION]	It is not mean.	Contradiction
A	yeah but
B	and it
A	yeah but I know people say that it's shallow to like look at someone's appearance but I think it really does matter like you can't like have a relationship with someone you don't find physically attractive
B	mm
A	as well as everything else
B	but then again like it could work both ways cos he could look at me and just think oh my god and like it could be really embarrassing so like both of us could just think the same thing or one of us could be into it and the other one not into it
A	mm
B	and it's like oh my god so much can go wrong I'll have to try and just put
A	well
B	or not turn up
A	or not turn up
B	mm
A	and if that happens then you just
B	cry in the street
A	well no you no you don't cry you just go back
B	go to the cinema on my own and watch Suffragette
A	well you could go to the cinema on your own
B	and be fuck
A	but you could just go back home and be like oh never mind that didn't work that was a bit of a fail
B	mm how much is the cinema in town anyway?
B	is it?
A	yeah
B	okay
A	if it's really bad I'll go to the cinema with you
B	oh my god
A	I'll take his ticket I'll like punch him in the face take his ticket and go
B	yeah
B	mm
A	I dunno it might not even be awkward
B	we
A	he might he might be really nice he might be like your future husband who knows?
B	wow we might have a little if I married him I'd be
A	that's so cool that's really cool
B	but I wouldn't change my name if I got
A	that suits
B	it does
B	don't bring that in again
B	oh my god oh my god wow

A	yeah it's gonna end up you seeing James Bond that's what's gonna happen
B	it's gonna end up what?
A	you're gonna end up going to see
B	I know that's I could see it going in that direction
A	yeah
B	the minute he said cinema
A	yeah
B	so I don't have a choice do I?
A	that's the only big film that's out at the minute
B	yeah but I've only seen the first one

A	I'm so proud of that
B	I'm so proud of your Yorkshire pudding wow
B	instagram it hashtag Yorkshire pudding
A	what a
B	I always feel bad right is it really strange? I always feel bad saying what things I like to somebody like it's like what do you wanna do?
A	yeah so do I
B	but it's like but I don't wanna be that
B	I don't wanna be that annoying person and be like oh I don't mind what do you wanna see? cos it almost looks like I don't care He Named Me Malala
A	suggest The
B	yeah cos I don't particularly want to see Spectre to be honest
A	yeah but you can get out of that by saying The Martian
B	yeah
A	cos apparently the one the Bond film's a bit boring and it's really sexist anyway and I don't really like James Bond
A	oh
B	oh dear
A	yeah
B	like so empowering
B	yeah I I
A	is this is this the feminist?
B	erm
A	no not her like him is he a feminist?

A	I don't know how to make mash I'll just bake potato and bash it
B	probably yeah just get a spatula if you have a spatula
A	yeah
B	these are very nice-looking Bake Off-type erm
A	it is I could go on Bake Off
B	you should that should be your career choice
B	yeah
A	I'm so good at cooking

B	yeah
A	that's true
B	yes twenty quid oh my god I'm so like oh what's going what's gonna happen? it's very strange

A	yay
B	The Martian
A	it's supposed to be good
B	yeah yeah it's meant to be really good I've heard from people that it's meant to be like I've not read the book or anything but it looks it looks good
A	no it's just one of those films you can go see and not really like yeah just
B	he did the mash he did the monster mash
B	mm
C	heya
B	oh right out of interest
A	mm yeah
B	really?
A	yeah
B	does that actually happen? because I never got one
A	no
B	I got somebody left they left me a book they didn't actually talk to me about it
A	yeah like we had a book from our GP
B	mm
A	and my mum erm took us through the book it was
B	oh wow
A	it was really
B	how old were you?
A	erm I dunno about eight I think
B	wow
A	well it wasn't it was like really awkward but
B	oh it was awkward yeah
A	although it wasn't that awkward looking back because I was so young that I didn't really feel awkward about sex yet so
B	no yeah
A	it was just kinda like it was good to learn it at that age I think
B	I think actually it would be more awkward talking like that sort of
A	oh yeah
B	than then
A	yeah
B	because then it's just this funny gross thing isn't it?
B	what did she say?
A	she just like told me about it she just like be be careful

B	I've got my date tomorrow oh my god
B	she's got an amazing Yorkshire pudding
A	I know you
C	nice
A	I know
C	erm hold on I don't think so you can use a fork that's what I do
A	yeah I know I'm trying but it's really difficult
A	no it's not even ready to mash yet if it's still boiling it's not really soft enough so I'm gonna leave it
C	I'd say probably the easiest thing to use is you've got one of these one of these things?
A	yeah
A	yeah a wooden spoon'll work that'll be alright
C	yeah but I'd say just wait for it to then put milk in it and then it will sort of mash itself really
A	yeah
C	I really hate how this does that
A	I haven't used the toaster does it work?
C	yeah
C	oh
B	yeah
B	to the cinema
C	with who?
B	erm
A	Wensleydale
C	where did you is that why you call
B	on Tinder
A	that's his nickname
C	right what what college is he in? what does he do? where is he? what
A	he's in
B	he's in
C	mm mm
B	and maths
C	oh
B	he's in second year
C	oh
B	and
A	he's in second year?
B	yeah
A	oh I didn't know that
B	he's second year and he's just turned twenty
A	mm
C	how did you meet him?
A	that's depressing for
B	Tinder
C	Tinder? you're going to the cinema what are you gonna see?
B	The Martian
C	he's probably gonna hate that cos he's like a physicist
B	why?
C	this is wrong this is inaccurate
B	it'd be right
B	also tell me interesting things about me erm I'm also hilarious
B	erm
A	yeah
B	I'm terrible at puns
A	you're not
B	I'm excellent at puns I'm
B	you're gonna be so glad you chose me of all the girls on Tinder
B	yeah I said
C	not that bad fine it's fine
B	I'll tell you about me to break the ice I like writing photography watching films and have a pet cat called
A	pretty much
C	what what did he say beforehand? telling you to break the
B	erm ah
B	no you wouldn't that that is quite right you would not do it any better cos that was an excellent start
A	it was
C	I like how like most people like when they start talking to someone online it's kind of
B	cos the thing is that's the point like
C	you're straightforward
B	this is this is awkward but it's not because I'm honest about it being awkward rather than trying to be like this is cool
B	erm
A	what do I say to that?
C	Jesus
A	yeah I think Jesus I think it's gotta be Jesus
B	Jesus
C	Jesus is like imagine if Jesus had Twitter
A	yeah but you're a Catholic so you have to say that
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker C is an Orthodox.	Entailment
C	no no but I'm just saying like loads of people would follow Jesus like to the point that like they would kill themselves like he could make an army of Christians like
A	yeah that's true
C	to be fair there'll be a lot of people that'll follow Batman as well
A	well cos Batman's rich so he'll have a lot of like
C	yeah but Jesus is in charge of the Catholic church so
A	that's true mm
C	well all the churches in fact the Catholic churches
A	does he
C	huh?
A	he just walks around barefoot
C	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Catholics don't believe in Budha.	Entailment
A	he doesn't really like control anything
C	yeah he wasn't that's the thing though like he
A	yeah
C	he just because he just fulfilled the prophecy of Jewish Judaism so he didn't actually have a like be a big deal it was just bits of teaching and miracles all that stuff but then they all were quite
A	yeah
C	put milk in it
B	yeah put
B	mash the milk in some butter
A	yeah it's the same
C	yeah and some butter as well
B	oh god I'm an
A	you're not
B	mm
A	that
[ANNOTATION]	Jesus Christ was irrelevant to the Jewish people.	Contradiction
B	that's a good point actually cos most boys actually feel like they have a responsibility to
C	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Boys are in charge of something.	Entailment
B	yeah
C	to lead the conversation
B	I mean I'm not sure how I feel about that if I was a boy really
C	mm
A	going very very badly
B	and my internet connection has gone again
A	just stop watching me like that I can see you it's working now it's fine
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B has a great type of internet connection.	Contradiction

A	he replied?
B	no
A	he will
B	yeah he he was totally up yeah
C	what's The Martian about then?

B	you know people that have insanely long hair how do they manage it? like I I mean by long I mean crazy long I mean like that long
A	a really
B	so long isn't it? and so thick like
B	I bet it would hurt when it was wet
C	yeah my hair was nearly as long as that but it was still really long and I'd get headaches
B	really?
C	cos when it was wet it was a lot heavier
A	yeah it must be so heavy
B	mm
B	yeah no I'd just get like neck pains I'd have to lie down
A	don't
C	put more milk in it
B	does it
C	is it kind of hard?
A	no it's too
C	is it separate?
A	yes

A	it just needs to be creamy I don't want it lumpy make it creamy
B	just mix it
C	I need like a wooden spoon do you have a wooden spoon?
B	maybe if you heat it up more it'll go less slimy
A	yeah I don't wanna heat it up though cos
C	in fact I think this is better can I use this?
A	yeah
B	that'll probably be better
C	yeah I
A	oh can I borrow your jug?

A	okay yeah no it's better now
C	it looks like mash
