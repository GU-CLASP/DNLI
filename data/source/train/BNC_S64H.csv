A	right so
B	erm I don't mind at all
A	virtually anything do you want to get any of like the spare ribby things to start or just the main stuff or?
B	mm I'll no just stick with something quite plain
A	yeah? okay so oh gosh how do you go back on this? alright
B	too far
A	I'm so used to doing everything on the Ipad now
B	mm
A	so
B	no I
A	mm
B	sit there with my laptop
A	mm
B	and my phone's touchscreen
A	yeah
B	so I'll sometimes sit there with my laptop and I'm thinking it's not doing it it's
A	I do that as well
A	I do that with the computer you start trying to touch stuff yeah
A	yeah so do you want like a chow meiny thing? or er when you're saying plain what what do you fancy?
B	er well normally I'd
A	to
B	I'd have something with a lot of chilli and normally I'd have you know I like curries as well but I think I'm just going to go for either something chicken and vegetables or you know
A	yeah
A	yeah right so we'll look at chicken dishes so
B	you see I love all of those
A	mm
B	er do you use a lot of chilli?
A	yeah
B	and garlic and
A	yeah
B	a friend of mine gave me a tip I don't know if you saw a photo I put on Facebook I've got two small jars
A	mm
B	and if you
A	yeah
B	no ginger and garlic
A	yeah
B	and I put a little bit of oil in mine and it will store for ages and ages and ages
A	mm
B	and then when you cook in stir fries or Indians or something
A	yeah
B	you just need
A	you've got it
B	a teaspoon or two and I
A	that's
B	I had a a massive amount of ginger cos I was going to do some more preserved ginger cos I'd used my last jar that I did
A	yeah
B	erm
A	mm
B	and it's a godsend
A	yeah or
B	but you know it's all
A	it's like the erm
B	natural
A	the lazy garlic that you can get
B	yeah
A	and the lazy ginger we had that we had
B	yeah
A	which I use
B	yeah
A	erm but we use the lazy garlic to
B	yes
A	but if I'm doing something quick I tend to just use these garlic granules I mean they work really well
B	yeah me too sometimes I just want chopped garlic
A	yeah yeah
B	big whole lumps of it but these
A	mm
B	er cos you know what it's you're getting stinky hands and stingy hands as well
A	yeah

A	and he he sort yeah he got it and did it and set them in the little plant pots and we set them out in bigger ones outside we were a bit late doing them but we've got quite a few now and we keep bringing them in these different chillies and I'm cooking
B	oh brilliant
A	we've got jalapeno peppers erm cayenne chillies and then some other ones as well and they they keep like they're all for
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B doesn't like planting.	Contradiction
B	oh that's fantastic
A	just all these chillies are growing
B	that's really inspired me actually cos
A	mm
B	was given a chilli growing set
A	mm
B	and it's got
A	yeah
B	in there erm a jam jar and a recipe for chilli jam
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B is not keen on starting his/her own plantation.	Contradiction
B	and it's got a bottle and a recipe for chilli sauce as well
A	mm yeah well we haven't got enough to make chilli jam or anything like that
A	no we keep using them yeah
B	yeah
A	we go off skiing all the time
B	yeah
A	for weeks here and there and we're at the lake and he's away and then it's down to me and I
B	yeah
A	you know so it we're not sure but so he's done it and it's it's it's been it's been good doing we enjoyed doing it and then we saw out by the fishpond we've got erm some some tubs on the top
[ANNOTATION]	One kg of chilli peppers are needed for a jar of chilli jam.	Neutral
B	yeah
A	but this thing was growing a plant and we didn't know what it was but obviously a bird's you know droppings or whatever
A	so we're leaving it and leaving it and
A	and there's all the berries all about to go drop into the fishpond and start
B	oh no
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A was certain from the beginning that it was a berries plant.	Contradiction
A	no no so
B	see that that's what I'm saying about this thing about
A	the elderflower
B	I wanted to make my elderflower
A	yeah
B	I need to take my
A	yeah
B	and and rosehip as well
A	yes
B	I'd love cos I'm sure

B	and he'll tell you what plant it is and he'll tell you what colours it grows
A	yeah?
B	and the the flowers
A	mm yes
B	and no he's he's fantastic he's he's er
A	mm
B	we used to sit sometimes with a dictionary this was our entertainment
A	yeah yeah
B	sit with a dictionary and go right yeah dad what does this word mean?
A	mm
B	and he knew every single word
A	yeah
B	there was one word I can
A	yeah
B	that we used to do it and there were four of us doing it
A	yeah
B	and we'd all take it in turns
A	yeah
B	and not let him get away with it and there was only one word I can remember him not knowing the definition of
A	but he knows it now
B	yeah I bet yeah
A	but my
B	yeah
A	my mum and my auntie they're very into words and mum lives
B	mm
A	and they do the er the Daily Mail crossword I mean my my auntie is sort of Mensa level
B	yeah
A	that they do the the Daily Mail crossword and then mum sort of says she'll get odd one she gets stuck on and usually she finishes it and the odd time she'll send one of them through to to auntie fourteen across so and so you know what is it? and and and she comes bang straight back and it when they find a word if mum finds a word that she thinks that
B	she comes straight back
A	comes back comes back comes back yeah
A	little ginger and freckles and
B	mm
A	yeah oh but yeah she's incredibly clever
B	going back to a
A	exactly
B	their own talents
A	yes exactly yeah
B	mm I bet she can't
A	yeah
B	play rock guitar can she?
A	no
A	but she's a really good photographer as well cos she's actually found she's taken it up as a bit of a study as a hobby
B	ah
A	erm and she goes out and she's started taking pictures of plants and and you know bees or bits and things like that
B	mm
A	and there's erm a website or a like a group that you can go onto and you all put every day you put pictures on and the group then vote at the end of each day of which the best picture is they all put votes in
B	oh
A	er and then the next day it comes in this was the the top picture shows and
B	yeah
A	she's had some of the top pictures as well so she's been really pleased
B	that's reminded me you gave me a a plant for putting on Facebook didn't you?
A	yes
B	and I've been poorly so I I didn't do it
A	no no
B	and I just remembered I must remember to do that
A	rosebay willow herb yeah that's right yeah that's my mum's favourite and I'll find often if I'm going on long train journeys that they're often at the side of the train tracks
B	yes yeah they tend to
A	yeah
B	it's saying that they grow like cos I looked at it on Wikipedia and about
A	mm
B	them grow growing on a lot of er derelict land
A	mm
B	and they just find their place don't they? we take
A	mm
B	and and it's
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	it's so pretty and I it's I I never even knew the name I'd never heard of it before
A	no
B	and it was all over
A	my mum's my mum's got that with all the wild flowers that er she cos she's got a book and she used to find when she started going out for walks years ago in the countryside
B	mm
A	she'd think oh what's that flower? what's that? and she said she used to like pick one very carefully cos she said you wouldn't take a lot
B	yeah
A	and then take it back and and learn what it was and
B	that's a good point my dad's got a little book it's only sort of a
A	yeah
B	a pocket-sized book
A	it's almost like the Gem Gem Collins ones isn't it?
B	yes yeah
A	the little tiny ones
B	British wild flowers
A	yeah yeah
B	and he's got another one British butterflies and
A	yeah yeah
B	I must borrow that wild flower one and take it out one day
A	yeah that's a good idea
B	yeah
A	yeah or ask him for one for Christmas
B	yes
A	you ought to have your own one you see
B	yes
A	then it'll be in years to come it'll be your dog-eared copy that you've
B	yeah
A	taken out
B	good thinking
A	yeah
B	good thinking
A	literally dog-eared
B	well yeah
B	yeah
A	so normally you would have

B	that's what I was just
A	two ah
A	remove
B	oh
A	add more items
B	click and be patient
A	oh I never can that's what
B	with technology I'm very impatient because
A	yeah
B	as far as I'm concerned it should work like that
A	yeah
B	and
A	yeah
B	there shouldn't be any problems any delays or anything
A	no that's my thing my thing with technology or anything if I press the button and something should happen
B	it's
A	it should happen
B	jolly well meant to happen there and then
A	and if it doesn't happen I get really and I wanna throw it across the room
B	yeah
A	mm
B	I have to lock my my computer
A	mm
B	even if I get up to go and speak to the woman

B	yeah
A	do you like that? I like the
B	mm
A	Chinese mushrooms
B	the straw mushrooms
A	add it yeah
B	no
A	no?
B	no not for me but did you
A	just
B	want some starters?
A	no I'm fine I
B	I bought a jar of those straw mushrooms and I put them in the cupboard
A	mm
B	with the egg noodles ready for
B	a proper Indian curry nothing at all Chinesy
A	oh no
B	and I said but they're straw mushrooms for Chinese he went oh I didn't use them all and there were five in the bottom of the jar
B	it certainly won't be something with mushrooms
A	oh I might need to create an account I thought I'd done that okay
B	so what did it come to altogether?
A	twelve fifty
B	oh okay
A	cos we like it from there and they went on it we then went and tried to do it online with their online ordering
B	yeah
A	which sounded great
B	yeah
A	and you there wasn't there wasn't the option to choose pick your own
B	oh pants
A	and then we went onto this Trio Treat
B	oh
A	so you didn't get it oh so in the end I rang them up and said okay great idea love the website love the ordering online but actually there's a slight problem with it and he was like oh I'm really sorry oh I'm ever so sorry oh I'm really sorry and like
B	and where was that?
A	erm Papa Luigi
B	Papa Luigi?
A	yeah I like there because I don't
B	mm
A	with my stomach so I like it if I have a nice thin crust
B	yeah
A	it's not as bad and a lot of places if you get the pizza it's always a real big thick deep crust or
B	yeah they're quite stodgy
A	where with them you can ask for the yeah ask for the thin crust and it's pretty good so
B	mm
A	so that's why we tend to get it from there rather than Domino's or somewhere
B	well we're going out at work for a a meal on Friday erm every month
A	yeah
B	there are eight teams
A	yeah
B	and every month you are given a department and you have to provide feedback
A	okay
B	on four different points and it's always the same four points but along with feedback you you give the team a score out of ten
A	right
B	erm and each month the
A	yeah
B	so er my team has won
A	yeah
B	but for February and March I said to the directors look you know we can't and er it would demotivate other teams so we awarded it to other teams erm but this is the very last one and I'm so pleased cos my girls work so so hard and erm we're going out to there's a new Bella Italia at
A	oh yes I tried to go there the other day and it hadn't opened
B	oh
A	we found out when we actually went and tried to open the door and the man came out and it it was open
B	ah
A	and he went erm oh he said we're not actually open yet and we're like oh right okay he said but we do have some VIP spaces for breakfast for next week when we open and
B	no they're not gonna come
A	we'll come when you're open okay bye oh it was funny
B	well we were looking at the menu today cos er I've not been to a Bella Italia I tend to in all honesty I tend to avoid chains
A	yeah
B	erm I prefer
A	yeah
B	these were rectangular ones I guess they're not going to be massive but it'll be enough for lunchtime with erm lots of rocket and things on them rather than cheese although there were
A	mm
B	were scrapings of cheese although I am going for the what am I going for as a starter?
A	yeah
B	so it's like having a
A	mm
B	with chips
A	well we went erm when I was up in
B	yeah
A	er there's you know a few different places you can eat there and they do a real nice it's a round pizza really thin base with
B	er with a hole in the middle?
A	yeah the hole in the middle
B	yes
A	with the salad?
B	yes
A	and we had that and it was really nice really tasty
B	yeah
A	really tasty
B	we'd erm exchanged some Tesco vouchers on a couple of occasions for Prezzo although we think we we've worn out the menu now there wasn't
A	mm
B	in all honesty there wasn't a massive amount that I would have chosen
A	no
B	I think because because we are quite creative at home when we cook and we make our own pizzas and we make our own Chinese and we make our own Indian I think I get a little bit bored with the same tastes that come out of these chain restaurants
A	yeah I know what you mean I know what you mean
B	erm but yeah I did like I had one of those pizzas and it was lovely on both occasions I had the same thing it's like my er my niece her it was her birthday last week and she invited everybody to go to to Nando's on Friday
A	oh yeah?
B	well last year my eldest daughter my youngest daughter her birthday is the middle of October and my elder daughter her birthday is exactly four weeks later and both of them wanted to go to Nando's and so the first time we were like mm yeah okay alright we haven't been before
A	mm
B	let's try it
A	no
B	and I think I had the lime chilli and lime or lime and something chicken and it was nice but then
A	oh no
A	yeah
B	had exactly the same
A	yeah
B	but they loved the place and after that I said right I don't care what you wanna do next year as in this next couple of months
B	we're not going to Nando's
B	and unfortunately I didn't go to
A	yeah I must admit we went
B	but I wouldn't choose anything
A	there were a couple of people leaving work oh so it was last year erm oh just
B	ah
A	that's fine okay very good erm yes oh thank you erm we what was I saying? oh yeah so there was a couple of people leaving from work
B	yeah yeah
A	and they're on about going to different places and then they
A	but never mind but I went I mean I didn't even know what you did or how you do it or anything like that
B	mm
A	but then I I just found that there wasn't again not a lot of choice and it was it was very basic chicken just cooked
B	and all very samey
A	yeah
B	just spicy chicken
A	yeah exactly just chicken like
B	oh did you?
A	yeah when you so it's all different flavours and er one of the lads there said oh do you wanna do it? I'll do it and I went yeah yeah I'll do it with you will will you? I said yeah yeah yeah we'll do it so we had this and sort of stood there and this table of about fifteen people and we were doing these wings so it's right okay and he had one and he was like
A	and I was having one going yeah it's fine yeah it's fine yeah and he had the next one and he was going
A	and I was going yeah that's alright I was going this is boring I want a hot one and he went that looks hot so I went okay no it's not and he went right and he took another one oh
A	and I'm
B	well cos my girls are really really daft
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	but the one down
A	yeah
B	she said if you can eat all your wings without eating any coleslaw or having a drink
A	yeah
B	and you can't eat any chips either
A	yeah
B	so you've just gotta eat your wings
A	yeah
B	I'll give you five pounds
A	yeah
B	and I said
A	no
B	that's gonna really hurt
A	yeah
B	that's why you have coleslaw cos it cools your mouth down
A	yeah
B	as you're eating them and she had tears running down her face
A	oh
B	and she was
A	yeah
B	and so we have this massive argument
A	wow
B	at
A	oh dear mm
B	mm
A	wings but er you know they weren't and I actually had whatever I had was the hot whatever and it wasn't that hot I remember we came back here one night after the beer festival and a load of people came round and we all had curries
B	yeah
A	and
B	mm
A	not and he was going oh right you have some of this I'll he had a phall cos in somebody like oh we're gonna have a phall have a phall yeah right
B	they're they're so macho
A	oh I know I know you have
A	and so she went yeah alright he said you've gotta have about five mouthfuls yeah alright she said and she just ate it she didn't flinch she didn't do anything she just ate it ate it ate it so there you are satisfied? she said I can eat them I just don't like the sensation
B	yeah
A	I don't she doesn't like anything too sweet too spicy
B	right
A	erm and it's this is how obviously how your taste buds are made
B	yeah
A	but you taste things more concentrated almost than other people so something that you would taste and it's really sweet they taste it as extremely sweet
B	mm
A	so
B	yeah
A	and so I think that it might be that with her
B	oh
A	I think she might be one of these supertasters
B	yeah possibly then
A	mm so she said she'd be quite good going in as like a tasting thing for something like having a job doing that
B	yeah
A	like the perfume smellers or somebody who's who tastes things
B	yeah yeah
A	but she said she'd actually sort of get the extreme thing of you know of the taste so
B	see I'm
A	yeah
B	so
A	mm
B	and we always have chilli in there but it it's always for the taste
A	yeah
B	and I don't understand these people that have to have always have to have the hottest to prove a point because they're not
A	yeah
B	necessarily enjoying
A	no
B	it as much as they might enjoy something else
A	mm
B	and erm when it comes to things to to sweets I really like sour sweets I've I've
A	yeah oh I do yeah
B	got more of a sour palette
A	yeah
B	erm I think I take after my mum as well because
A	mm
B	and she was
A	yeah
B	and I
A	mm
B	than the sweet taste
A	yeah
B	whilst I love sweets and chocolate I can't eat things like Minstrels er not Minstrels sorry Maltesers cos I find them too sweet
A	really?
B	and I and I I won't eat them
A	I eat a whole bagful
B	oh yeah
A	if I have the big bag to share I'll sit and eat a whole bag of that
A	yeah
B	so it's Minstrels or
A	yeah
B	or whatever it might MandM's
A	I suppose the honeycomb
A	it's that particular that sweet
B	yeah
A	yeah mm
B	erm I made a a big cake on Friday for work for erm Macmillan cancer fundraising
A	mm yeah
B	and it was four layers of fatless sponge
A	right
A	oh I saw the picture on Facebook yeah
B	it was er it was low calorie sponge
A	yeah
B	with all the cream and chocolate fudge icing and chocolate things all around the side
A	cream chocolate fudge icing and
B	yeah but it was a fat free sponge
B	and I put Minstrels on the top and Maltesers
A	mm
B	and I had a slice at work and I couldn't eat that I just left all the Maltesers and people were going oh god you're not eating them but you love chocolate you're a real chocoholic
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	and erm the other sweet things I don't that I'm not keen on? erm ice creams but I think it's the cold rather than the sweet
A	mm
B	cos I'll make my own ice creams
A	yeah
B	and
A	mm
B	and it was just evaporated milk and cream and I didn't put any sugar in it and I said taste this and I actually thought it tasted quite nice it was almost savoury
A	yeah
B	and he said it tastes like cheese
B	and I had another taste and I kind of got what he's where he was coming from
A	yeah like like a dairy taste
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	and I thought but that's actually nice
A	yeah
B	I like it so whilst I can eat chocolate er
A	mm
B	I can't eat Bournville cos it's too sweet and yet
A	mm
B	I love dark chocolate
A	yeah yeah yeah I I know what you mean
B	but it has to be quite bitter
A	yeah so like the Green and Black's ones?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	mm
B	mm
A	yeah
B	but I'm more more savoury I think
A	so would you do you eat sugar as in sugar cubes?
B	I
A	you know when you're when like in the café cos they're
B	yeah if I do a
A	yeah
B	have the brown sugar cube because it's not as sweet as the white I find but
A	yeah
B	I think it's more nostalgia
A	mm
B	cos we used to do it as children
A	yeah yeah
B	it was such a treat you know when the little sugar cubes
A	mm
B	paper wrappers didn't they if you went to the
A	yes
B	a café like Woolies
A	yeah
B	café
A	yeah
B	mum would have a cup of tea or coffee
A	I loved Woolies
B	on a Saturday
A	the café yeah
B	and erm they'd always put sugar cubes on the tray or they'd be on the table or something
A	yeah
B	and can I have a sugar cube? can I have a sugar cube? can I have a sugar cube?
A	yeah
B	and you'd unwrap it and there'd be these
A	well I still do now I
B	two little gems
A	when you're places like that you know I just you sort of think I'll sit there and you think oh you're in a café and they always say don't because of all the stuff you're touching and other people touching it and things like that
B	yeah
A	but I just sit and I think oh now just eat them
B	it er for me like I say it's nostalgia
A	yeah
B	you used to do it as children and it's one thing that
A	mm
B	it just takes you back for that instant of being a child again
A	yeah mm
B	I think something else that I do at the moment and I can only put it back to childhood cos otherwise it makes me a big daft
B	my coat that I wear to walk
A	mm
B	is full bulging of the pockets of conkers
A	mm
B	I can't resist picking up conkers and stuffing them in my pockets and we do do it for a practical reason cos
A	yeah
B	bite them in half and spit them out again
A	mm
B	so we'll start off the walk and I'm throwing conkers but as we pass under the chestnut trees
A	yeah
B	I have to fill I have to wait wait a minute I can't there's too many to pick up you're gonna have to carry some of these
B	and er I I literally have my pockets crammed and I'm carrying as many as I can carry in my hands and I'm looking back at all the ones that I left on the ground thinking what a shame
A	you need to start taking a bag
A	or take the bag with you and just
B	but the thing is the logical part of my head is saying don't be stupid there'll be there tomorrow when you take
A	yeah but somebody else like you might come past
B	but the
A	and pick them all up
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B should leave their stuff there until the next day.	Contradiction
B	yeah yeah the nine-year-old in me is thinking
B	there's a big one
A	mm
B	and they er he he's not used to the idea of conkers but
A	but well so don't they have conkers in Ireland? that's a daft thing to say
B	well like they they do
A	they must have horse chestnut trees
B	but but not not like the
A	they don't play conkers?
B	cos I I explained to him about the conker championship
A	it is a very British thing I suppose yeah yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Although you can play it in other places, playing conkers is a British thing.	Entailment
B	er
A	yeah
B	have you ever been to it in
A	no no I see it in the paper
B	again
A	every year
B	we used to go as children
A	mm
B	it's fabulous it's such fun erm but when I I put a post about it on Facebook about this pocketful of conkers and I've got an American friend
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	B only has British friends on Facebook.	Contradiction
B	er almost every post that I put she comes in and says sorry gonna have to explain what's such and such
A	yeah
B	what's so and so
A	yeah
B	and I find myself when I'm replying to her using very American terms
A	mm
B	and erm
[ANNOTATION]	She always asks for explanations.	Entailment
A	oh right
B	I oh yeah I can really
A	yeah
B	see where that comes from
A	yes yeah
B	and I thought that was really interesting cos I'm going oh she doesn't know what conkers are but
A	yeah
B	if she'd said about buck's eyes
A	but I bet they don't play it over there
[ANNOTATION]	Everybody knows what conkers are regardless of their origin.	Contradiction
B	I'd had no idea
A	don't play
B	well no I said you have to poke a hole all the way through it and thread a string in and I the
A	mm
B	tried to describe actually the playing conkers
A	yeah yeah
B	and the fact that now it's it health and safety police have
[ANNOTATION]	You need to poke holes to play conkers.	Entailment
A	oh it's ridiculous isn't it?
B	have tried to knock it on the head and
A	yeah
B	and schools are are saying you can't play it in the playgrounds
A	yeah
B	and didn't do us any harm
A	no no
B	we didn't come away with broken
A	no
B	knuckles did we?
A	my brother did get hit in the eye with a conker
B	oh
A	and actually it bled and they had to take
A	him to hospital and quite serious they weren't sure what was gonna happen and he had all the blood all seeping out
B	oh no
A	but he was fine it didn't stop him playing it but er yeah
A	even so yeah
B	does it smell of vinegar?
A	yeah or
B	yeah
A	did it smell baked has he had it in the oven? and
B	but yes has it been in the? yeah
A	yeah no good conker off you go

B	bit too bit too close to knackers but yeah
A	ker-knackers ker-knackers yeah
B	the once your ball's on the string
A	yeah and
B	you used to
A	oh that was
B	they did hurt
A	brilliant yeah oh no I was brilliant with those I could

B	why is it boys
B	are always so much better at yoyos than girls?
A	I know
B	I don't know why
A	yeah no no I don't know why
B	what else did we used to play? in the in the playground we'd have erm metal netball hoops with the round
A	mm
B	bases
A	yeah
B	erm and we used to play marbles in there and Jacks
A	mm oh yeah
B	have you ever played Jacks?
A	oh yeah I used to play used to play Jacks with my mum
B	did you?
A	and then I introduced all my mates to it because yeah mum used to play it I think my mum basically the there were five kids
B	yeah
A	but there's five years in between each child
B	oh right
A	so as one went to school
B	to school another one came along
A	it was like oh it would be nice to have a little one running round so that's what they did which meant she would grow up with older sisters
B	yeah
A	and brothers but it was almost like all of them were only children because
B	yes
A	the gap so she said she used to play a lot of the you know the catchy with the tennis ball against the wall
B	yeah yeah
A	and Jacks she used to play that for hours
B	yeah
A	so she taught us how to play that and we used to play it with all our friends
B	erm marbles
A	marble yeah oh god yeah we used to
B	oh if you got a bullseye
A	oh yeah I know
B	a biggie
A	and we used to go to
A	yeah we used to go to yeah we used to go because we used to play it all the time erm
B	yeah
A	really used to like play that
B	and there'd be tears but you'd won it fairly
A	exactly yeah yeah especially if you got the
B	yeah
B	yes
A	I used to love playing hopscotch and again with my kids doing it and just getting them to play it
B	and
A	with it
B	French skipping where you'd have that
A	yeah
B	bit of elastic and you'd all have a rash at the back of your knees
A	yes
B	cos it really
A	yeah used to have that
A	and that that in it when it was er like the
B	yeah
A	yeah round round the two of you
B	uhu and I could still do that
A	and you yeah
B	now you know
A	you'd stand and crossed your legs over and do that and then there's
B	and you'd have to flick it like that
A	yeah exactly
B	and jump in the middle
A	and jump yeah yeah
B	I used to this is er how much sad I was I mean I've got three big sisters
A	mm
B	but the the youngest of the three is five years older than me
A	yeah
B	and then six years and then nine years
A	yeah
B	so what you were saying there about your mum I felt although I was from
A	yeah
B	probably had the biggest family
A	yeah
B	but I often felt like as a little girl that I did a lot of my growing up on my own
A	mm
B	a lot of my playing on my own
A	yeah
B	or with my friends but not with my sisters
A	yeah
B	cos
A	oh yeah so they were like inseparable
B	and they did everything together
A	or always just knew
B	yeah
A	each other there and
B	and
A	yeah
B	was nine years older so she didn't want a baby sister hanging around
A	no
B	and I used to our our house the one of the rooms downstairs rooms was a converted garage so it had a concrete floor
A	right
B	so we could make as much noise jumping up and down in there as we wanted
A	oh yeah yeah
B	so I used to get two heavy kitchen stools with elastic on them because we had
A	oh
B	like bar stools
A	yeah yeah
B	with the elastic on them and I used to do French skipping on my own
A	ah
B	yeah I know
A	oh that's sad
B	it's sad
A	but yeah that's good though that's nice cos a lot of kids would have just sat and moped and done but you were inventive and you actually thought
B	yeah
A	oh I'm gonna do this
[ANNOTATION]	Person A is going to dance	Contradiction
B	yeah
A	that's like when you hadn't got enough when you're doing the skipping with the long skipping rope and if you hadn't enough you'd tie one to the end of the lamp post
B	yes
A	so that two could be in
B	so just two
A	and one turn it and
B	yeah
A	yeah yes
B	if you didn't have them long enough
A	yeah and then that
[ANNOTATION]	Person A think he should have them long enough	Entailment
B	and then crack
A	you used to crack here
B	crack your ankles
A	yeah I do look back to childhood and just think the games that we had and
B	they're so simple
A	yeah yeah
B	and you often didn't need anything I I remember again on my own I'd got it must have been quite a new dolly's pram
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Person A is going to have a sandwich	Contradiction
B	and I had my dolly in there and I was walking up and down the street god I could only
A	mm
B	only about seven
A	mm
B	and the hedges everybody's hedge cos we all had hedges
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Person A agrees that the all had hedges	Neutral
B	that was another shop
A	right
B	and I used to pretend that I was buying things from the shop and I'd pick a leaf and that would be what I was buying and I'd pay with another leaf that I'd picked off another
B	hedge I was a happy little weird child
A	mm
B	quite happy on my own but my dad says
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Person a is thinking about the thing that Person b said	Neutral
B	and our primary school the uniform was blue well it was grey skirts and and
A	yeah
B	but we had to wear blue knickers
A	mm
B	and my dad says he'd come round there'd be all these girls doing handstands up against the wall
A	yes
B	and because I was the smallest I'd have to go up first and hold it
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Person A agrees that he had to go up at first because he was the smallest	Neutral
B	then the next one
A	yeah
B	would go on top of me
A	oh yeah
B	and then the next
A	yeah
B	and then the next
A	yeah
B	we'd be like dominoes of the and my arms would be like this by the time the last was there
B	and my dad said he would come home there'd be rows of blue knickers
A	yeah there was lots of blue knickers yeah
B	upside down against the wall
A	yeah
B	it's no wonder he used to pack his bags and go walking for a week or two in the summer isn't it?
[ANNOTATION]	B's father used to go walking in the summer for at least 4 weeks	Contradiction
A	mm
B	he used to walk Hadrian's Wall or
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	B never knew his father	Contradiction
B	the Pennine Way or
A	yeah?
B	anything
A	yeah
B	to do the coastal walk
A	oh right
B	I think he was all for it as well but he didn't have enough holiday
A	oh that's a shame
B	mm
[ANNOTATION]	B's father once walked the Pennine Way in 1 day	Contradiction
A	but
B	I thought it was brave the way he kept coming back
B	yeah even the cat was a girl
A	yeah
B	he had no
A	mm
B	he used to disappear round next doors
A	yeah
B	but er
A	mm
B	what games?
A	we were lucky because we'd played in a erm we lived in a cul-de-sac when
B	mm
[ANNOTATION]	B's dad didn't have enough holidays	Entailment
A	we moved quite a lot but when we were sort of ten to fourteen age which is when you're really out kicking round in the street isn't it?
B	yeah
A	we we lived in this cul-de-sac and it was it it sort of came round and went up a hill
[ANNOTATION]	B has lived in a cul-de-sac at the age of 2	Neutral
B	okay
A	so whenever it was winter and it was snowing
B	oh
A	it was fantastic cos no cars cos he sort of came down a hill to go round to go in it
B	yeah
A	so no cars could get out or come back and we'd go out and people would be there with the sledges and bits
B	oh fantastic
A	and obviously not everybody had sledges so people would be coming out we used to go on erm bin liners
[ANNOTATION]	B's favourite season is winter	Neutral
B	yeah
A	erm somebody bought out an old toilet seat cos they were having the
B	oh
A	bathroom done up and that was fantastic it was so slippery it was amazing
B	we used to use er you know the bags that peat comes in?
A	yeah
A	yeah yeah
B	and that sort of thing
A	yeah
B	we used to use those dad would
A	oh
B	dad would dad would er turn them inside out
A	yeah yeah
B	so
A	and you'd just go as I say
B	yeah
A	and everyone would be going up and up and up and that and then there'd always be a big snowball right and snowmen being built and it oh let's do one where we go up and down the road and get this huge great snowman
B	and roll the balls yeah
A	yeah oh yeah it was lovely yeah it was great
B	I'd always try to encourage my children to have fun without spending any money as well
A	mm
B	and you don't need
A	no
B	expensive equipment and
A	no
B	my dad used to make so much for us I remember
A	mm
B	see the girls thought I was weird I guess
A	mm
B	walking up and down with my pram pulling hedges to pieces
B	but my dad made me a rifle and
A	mm
B	do you know it was the simplest I think it was just a a square or a wooden dowelling maybe
A	right
B	bit of wooden dowelling
A	yeah
B	and a and a flat bit for the erm sort of the handle and a bent nail for the trigger
A	yeah
B	that's that's
A	yeah
B	all it was it was like three things
A	mm
B	maybe a little bit more I was so chuffed with this rifle
A	yeah
B	and I remember I could I couldn't have been much more than about seven cos it was in the summer
A	mm
B	and of course we had fantastic summers every day was wonderful wasn't it?
A	yeah yeah
B	and all I
B	so I was topless
A	yeah
B	cos this is how much of a tomboy I was
A	yeah
B	so I can't really have been realistically more than about seven I don't suppose
A	yeah
B	and to have this rifle
A	yeah
B	that's just amazing it was the best toy ever
A	mm
B	but my mum used to work erm in the evenings again to escape us
B	erm there used to be a toy company in
A	right
B	erm around
A	okay yeah yeah
B	and they used to make er plastic toys and it would be things like erm and my sisters and I all remember we had erm plastic saucepans but they were different colours and different sizes
A	yeah
B	they all had faces on them
A	oh yeah I remember them
B	so she used to er be able to buy these quite
A	mm
B	cheap at
A	yeah
B	a staff discount so we had loads of plastic toys and I suppose then in the when was I born? so in the early seventies she started working there a bit before maybe before I was born even
A	mm
B	they were quite sort of
A	oh yeah
B	new and modern and so we were really really
A	mm
B	and they probably even with
A	so she was probably just working to earn the money to get
B	yeah yeah
A	the toys
B	I think actually I don't think that's that's far from wrong
A	mm
B	well because she
A	right
B	that year
A	yeah
B	to earn some more money for Christmas
A	mm
B	and she stayed there for I don't know now a little while anyway
A	mm
B	mm
A	my mum did Avon
B	did she?
A	with yeah cos she was erm on her own then with three little kids or even in fact before that and she used to sell Tupperware when my dad and her were still together so she used to go up and do Tupperware parties
B	yeah
A	and it was when it was all erm just first in you know so she used to go and do
B	mm
A	and going along and going all the way along doing all the the Avon round erm and I remember when I was on my own with the kids and they well no in fact before I was on my own with them I'd get yeah
B	ah
A	oh less than two
B	ah
A	so she would walk along and but it was
B	mm
A	so I went out the very first time and I had a little note and it said I'm just starting to do that I'll be coming to collect this book on that day and I will give you the next book then and you know or so that sort of thing so I went round and knocked and did it on all the doors and you know if you don't want to be disturbed leave it outside so there were lots of books on the outside and some of them had little notes thank you don't want to have it
B	yeah
A	that kind of thing others were saying er yeah thank you if you'd like to leave it again I don't want anything this time and I just got that routine every three weeks I'd always collect the book and drop the book off
B	at the same time
A	so I'd be dropping off the stuff they'd ordered collect the book and give the new book so everybody knew every three weeks and especially in the run up to Christmas
B	mm
A	you know it got people knew them and they started sort of buying this stuff
B	yeah
A	but I used to go round with
B	yeah
A	so she captivated loads of people and
A	and they obviously used to think oh this this poor young lady er poor girl coming out with these little children they loved it
B	feed her babies
A	well exactly yeah
A	but they they absolutely
B	yeah
A	and er coming up to Christmas giving them sweets and selection boxes I'd be coming back with all these presents and things for them
B	ah
A	but yeah I think it's
B	you need what you need to do
A	yeah exactly you do don't you? yeah you do
B	mm
A	mm
B	I did erm
A	mm
B	I was just a bit concerned about how money was gonna go so I thought I know I'll I'll do something like Betterware
A	yeah
B	oh my god what a nightmare it was
A	yeah
B	it was
A	mm
B	it was it a it was a steep learning curve cos I thought well yeah this'll be alright
A	mm
B	you know earn some money
A	mm
B	I think by the cos you had to pay for all of your catalogues
A	oh did you? yeah
B	I think once you'd paid for them and you'd deliver them you know hand them all out
A	mm
B	and then go to collect them the next time and they wouldn't be there so you'd knock and ask for it
A	yeah
B	and one guy he was so rude to me and I said look I you know I don't mean to be rude but if you don't want to order please may I have it back? I said I've had to pay for it
A	yeah
B	no you put things through my door I've thrown it in the bin and I went home and cried because
A	ah
B	because it was winter's night
A	yeah
B	I was frozen to the bone
A	mm
B	I er he was the last one cos I'd knocked and there was no answer although there were lights on and I thought well I'll
A	yeah
B	as I've got to go back again I'll
A	yeah yeah call round
B	just knock in
A	yeah
B	and I I cried all the way home
A	oh
B	I went home to an empty house on that particular night as well
A	oh no
B	and I was just so
A	mm yeah yeah like I say
B	mm
A	you do what you have to do don't you? you tried it
B	yeah
A	and it's not gonna it's not right then you'd move onto something else wouldn't you?
B	no that's it that's it and I did er I soon got rid of it and er
A	yeah
B	I'm gonna do it for myself
A	yeah
B	I'm gonna know exactly what I'm
A	look into it yeah
B	letting myself in for
A	yeah
B	I'll buy my stock and I'll sell my stock
A	mm
B	and it certainly works a lot better
A	yeah
B	doing it that way cos I would even even with Betterware I would even have like the area manager ringing me up saying how much have you done how much have you done? you need to make sure
A	yeah
B	there wasn't anything about targets
A	no no
B	there was nothing about that yeah but if you you have to do that much this month to get your your bonus
A	mm
B	next month and
A	yeah
B	and like well I'm
A	no that's not on
B	that's not what I signed up for
A	no
B	not at all
A	no no
B	mm
A	mm yeah
B	with Avon and everything's and people are making a jolly fortune
A	yeah I did I did really really well with Avon cos I think again I cos I used to chat to people and I'm good at selling natural sales person anyway
B	yeah
A	so I used to go round chatting to people saying well I thought about maybe
B	mm
A	money back no problem etcetera and I knew I'd sent odd bits back and so I you know yeah seriously so if they weren't sure and that's it and so people started to trust and get more and more and if anybody wasn't quite happy
B	yeah
A	no no problem take it back don't worry
B	that's the thing isn't it?
B	it's building up that reputation
A	yeah yeah this is it
B	not just for the product
A	yeah
B	but for yourself as well
A	and also cos you could buy these the sample things to put in with people's orders and that I found that
B	yeah
A	so I used to put certain things in and then I'd put a little note I've tried this or or so you now so this was recommended to me by somebody you know let me know what you think and just try it and then people would start and even if they wouldn't buy it they'd tell me why they did or didn't like it
B	yeah
A	I prefer so and
B	it gets you talking to people doesn't it?
A	yeah exactly yeah
B	see I talk to everybody that comes to my stand when I'm working
A	yeah
B	and even if it's just have you had a good day? cos normally the er I'm at an event there's something going on
A	yeah
B	or I'll talk to the children
A	mm
B	or I'll talk to their dog but I'll
A	yeah
B	strike a a conversation
A	yes yeah
B	or I'll say you know you're welcome to pick anything up and have a closer smell what a gorgeous dog and then I don't even talk about
A	yeah
B	my products any more
A	no this is it
B	if they wanna buy something they will or they'll ask me a question
A	yeah
B	but I just want to keep them
A	yeah
B	er in in some kind of conversation
A	mm
B	it doesn't matter what it's about I want them to start to like me as a person that's interested in them
A	yeah that's it
B	and their child or their dog
A	yeah and then you're open and receptive and therefore they will
B	yeah yeah exactly
A	it's like when you go into a shop and as soon as you walk in hello you alright can I help you?
B	yes yes is there something particularly you're looking for?
A	yeah
B	er no I just want to look
A	I'll let you know if I
B	yeah
A	I'll let you know if I need any help or got any questions
B	yeah
A	and
B	I mean I do scare some people off I have to say
A	yeah
B	cos I
A	mm
B	and I try to
A	yeah
B	I don't like to
A	no
B	I can go six hours without sitting down
A	yeah
B	and and just
A	yeah
B	constantly sort of walking around but sometimes I'll even walk away from my stall
A	yeah
B	and I'll be maybe three or four metres away from it
A	yeah
B	so people feel they they've got
A	yeah
B	no
A	yeah
B	there's no one there
A	mm
B	they can see there's no one there and then as I see them start to have a look and another look and another look I'll maybe wander a little bit closer and just start adjusting things and straightening up
A	yeah yeah
B	and then go oh hello how are you?
A	yeah
B	and that's it
A	yeah
B	that's how I if I'm in a shop if I'm looking at anything that's how I
A	yeah
B	feel more comfortable
A	yeah yeah I know I know I agree I think I think totally I mean if I walk into a shop and people you know there's somebody sort of goes alright or just that's it and doesn't even really say more than that it's like
B	yeah I know they're there
A	I've seen you coming I've acknowledged your presence
B	yeah
A	you know I've spoken to you so you don't have to feel worried about coming to talk to me
B	mm
A	and I'm doing something and I'm glancing across occasionally and and that sort of thing and
B	mm
A	I'd far rather have that than the people that
B	mm
A	jump on you or the people that are on the phone and not even looking at you when you come to the counter
B	yeah
A	and you're sort of like hello?
B	well I take my knitting or crochet or whatever I'm doing
A	oh yeah yeah
B	and I'll often sometimes I get people just just come over and
A	yeah
B	like I say I stand in front of my stall
A	yeah
B	and people will come over and they'll go what are you knitting? I've given crochet lessons
B	two or three people have have a couple of weekends ago
A	yeah
B	there was a vintage car show on the embankment in
A	oh yes I remember yeah
B	and er I yeah I was actually giving crochet patterns and
A	mm
B	and there was a
A	mm
B	and they had a a massive stash of different wool and things
A	yeah
B	and somebody gave her a bag anyway and she said to me it's years and years since I've done any crochet or knitting she said
A	mm
B	I've got all the kit I've got all my needles
A	mm
B	and all the hooks she said I I just
A	yeah
B	but watching you there she said
A	yeah
B	can you just remind me?
A	how to do it yeah
B	so I just showed her what I was doing
A	yeah
B	and she said and remind me again how you do the next row how you turn the corner to go to the next row
A	mm
B	so I actually wasn't doing any of that but I I literally sort of stopped what I was doing and started
A	yeah
B	doing what she asked me to show her
A	yeah mm
B	cos it's so easy to undo and she she touched my arm at the end of it and she said thank you so much she said you've really inspired me now I'm gonna go home and I'm
A	yeah
B	gonna make something with the ball that somebody cared enough about me
A	yeah yeah
B	to to pass this on
A	ah
B	she said I don't know what I'm gonna do but I'm gonna do something
B	and there was another lady and she said to her her daughter was about nine I think and her daughter was kind of looking er and she was she was
A	mm
B	bored instantly and she's and her mum said to her I used to do this nanny taught me to to do this when I was your age she said I can't really remember it now
A	mm yeah
B	and she said but if you want to do it nanny'll teach you and and she kinda went mm
A	mm
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	she
A	yeah yeah
B	and for old ladies I said you can knit so many cool things I said
A	mm
B	you can knit erm you know a blanket or a cushion cover I said and it might not sound brilliant I said but if you've made it and you're sitting there all wrapped up in it all cuddled up in it and snuggly
A	yeah yeah
B	you can feel so proud of yourself and she was like maybe
A	yeah
B	what you doing there then?
B	and and how do you get a different colour? and then she started getting interested
A	yeah yeah
B	and asking questions and I thought cos they say at work cos I started a crochet club at work
A	oh right
B	Thursday lunchtimes there's a couple of girls come
A	mm
B	teaching the world crochet
B	one person at a time
A	yeah
A	mm well I
B	I might have some with me
A	no don't
B	yeah
A	and stuff like that
B	was there a favourite one that you made?
A	erm no
A	no it it was it was more a means to an end cos I didn't have a lot of money
B	yeah
A	so it was a case of yeah I'll I'll just make some stuff for them that will be stuff they can have and then I won't have to buy anything but
B	mm
B	oh god yes
A	and it was two tones and panels of it
B	and did you start from that arm knit across
A	no no er
B	and it
A	it was
B	I remember knitting one of my
A	it was different bits that you then had to put together
B	oh
A	and do it well I did it and did it and ended up doing it and I put one a bit on upside down and realised
A	and then by the time I was getting it I got so disgruntled with it I just left it
A	and and then in the end I can't remember whether it was my mum or someone
B	yeah
A	like every time I looked at it I was so pig sick of it cos all I had done was do this knitting and then it was taking so long and then it wasn't right and then and er yeah
B	yeah I know what you mean
A	no so and I've not knitted since
B	well I like small things which is why I knit all my tea cosies
A	on what?
B	Etsy E T S Y
A	what's that?
B	it's a website it's a bit like Ebay
A	right
B	but you have to have made the item yourself
A	oh okay
B	so it's all hand crafted stuff
A	mm
B	and and made in this country
A	yeah
B	either you have to do it
A	yeah
B	or somebody that is making it for you specifically for you
A	yeah
B	so erm you know if you and I decided we were going to make something
A	yeah
B	and sell them then that's absolutely fine
A	right
B	and I it only costs it's free to set up you set up your own shop
A	mm
B	so my little shop's called
A	mm
B	and yet all you pay for to list an item you pay twenty P
A	right
B	and it stays on there for three months
A	right
B	or until you sell it
A	yeah
B	so I I put three different styles of tea cosy
A	mm
B	but I put in each what so that's three items sixty P
A	yeah
B	but for each one you could put a
A	okay yeah
B	erm and then if but my thinking was that if somebody wanted to order it they would then send me a message to say what colours they wanted
A	mm
B	but the price of the tea cosy would be
A	yeah yeah
B	the same and I woke up a few
A	oh
B	I was like wow
A	that's lovely
B	and I messaged her because she was her her name was this
A	mm
B	but the delivery name was Mr and Mrs something else
A	right
B	er and an address that was different
A	mm
B	to the Paypal
A	yeah
B	invoice address
A	yeah
B	erm and I messaged her and I said thank you so much for your order
A	mm
B	really appreciate it and I put the knitting needles are out
A	yeah
B	because like in the shop it says please allow twenty-eight days for for your product
A	yes
B	to be lovingly created for you I was
A	yeah
B	as I said the needles are out I said and erm
A	yeah
B	and she messaged back and she said that is so lovely to know that it's being made just for me
A	actually made now for them yeah
B	she said that's so wonderful
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	which is what Etsy's all about
A	yeah
B	is handmade and she said she said erm it's for my friend as an anniversary present
A	yeah
B	so I messaged her back and I said would you like me to put a little message in there?
A	yes
B	to say that it's from you? and she went oh yes please if you could put so and so happy anniversary with love from so and so and so and so
A	yeah
B	she said that's amazing thank you so much and I'm
A	what's the website? I'm gonna have a look
B	Etsy dot com E T S Y dot com I mean there's so many things on there there's hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of shops and it's all people some of them they are clearly
A	yeah yeah
B	it might be jewellery or
A	I'm just thinking
B	all sorts
A	she does a lot of crafting and a lot of erm
B	okay
A	that sort of out at
B	see that sort of thing would be fabulous on there
A	yeah and that's what I'm just thinking
B	because there's it's all so big
A	I'll I'll tell her about it
B	all sort of vintage and chic and
A	yeah
B	kitsch it's all really really big again isn't it?
A	yeah I as I
B	well I thought if nothing else it's cost me sixty P
A	yeah
B	if nothing comes of it
A	mm
B	you know you pay more than that sometimes listing something on on Ebay
A	yeah
B	and people that look on it see are looking for
A	mm
B	some skill's gone into it a bit of time's gone into it
A	mm
B	cos people often look at my tea cosies and I'll I sell them for most of them for ten pounds
A	yeah
B	and they look at them and they say oh I don't know if I want to spend ten pounds and I'm almost screaming at them do you know how long it took me to make that?
A	yeah
B	it probably took me ten hours
A	yeah
B	never mind the price of the wool or everything else
A	er the thing is and if they tried to make it it would probably take them
B	yeah
A	twenty-five hours
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	no do you have the skill to make it? no
A	yeah no
B	so you can't make it so you have to pay for it then
A	no exactly no exactly
B	geez
B	yeah but it's such a lovely feeling when somebody wants something you've made
A	yeah that is really nice yeah as I say I'll I'll tell
B	yeah yeah do it's it's very popular
A	if she's interested in I know she does a lot of knitting teddies for the hospitals for the
B	ah yeah
A	stillborn babies and stuff you know and and things like that and erm but I don't know whether she'd be
B	oh okay
A	so she's yeah and er and so she's not been working for quite a while now but it's something she likes doing a lot of the the crafting stuff
B	mm
A	so it may be actually she'd think oh actually I could make
B	yeah lovely
A	she makes them makes the cards and stuff like that so
B	mm
A	yeah even if she she could just log on she might even just get ideas of stuff to make
B	exactly
A	but yeah
B	exactly well that's what I often do I have a look to see what's on and what's around and how much people are charging as well
A	yeah
B	so we whether I'm selling it on the stall or you know at work people are
A	yeah
B	erm and I've got one lady there she's so lovely she says to me I've got another order for you
B	and I had to make a Westie dog
A	yeah
B	and I got a pattern for a toy which was quite hard to come by but I got a pattern for this toy and it's gorgeous
A	yeah
B	but it's so big the toy it's imagine the dog sitting down it's about
A	oh right
B	that big what's that? a foot twelve inches?
A	yeah
B	I think it's about thirteen or fourteen inches actually the measurement
A	mm
B	I thought that's too big
A	yeah
B	I was only gonna do the head
A	yeah
B	on er long you can get wool that looks like fur when it's knitted
A	okay yeah
B	so that's what I knew I'd use so I was gonna do the tea cosy with the same fur and then put this head on top
A	yeah
B	and I did the first one and it was like massive
B	it was the size of a it looked like a basketball on top of this tea cosy and it was a big
A	mm
B	tea cosy
A	yeah
B	as well I thought that's ridiculous
A	even Westies aren't even that big dogs are they? you know
B	no they're not
A	you know if you did an Alsatian or something
A	then you can imagine oh it's a life size one okay
A	ah
B	and then I had to do it on smaller needles
A	yeah
B	this wool was
A	mm
B	so I did it and I had to undo it about four times I started it five times and by the time I'd finished I was like
A	mm
B	and I posted a picture on
A	yeah
B	let me know what you think and one of my friends went on it went I love this can you do one for me? I'm thinking
B	I really don't want to
A	oh yeah you do selective
B	could you do it as a door stop? she said mm
A	yeah you need to be selective about mine did that actually you could do that the right size couldn't you? with this
B	yeah yeah
A	actually a life size Westie dog
B	you could do could do actually
A	mm
B	cor dear me yeah but
A	mm
B	and I'm I'm lucky my mum had a lot of
A	yeah
B	knit crochet not so much crochet but and sew
A	mm
B	is that my tummy rumbling?
A	yeah that's your tummy rumbling
B	it was the door
A	let me just go and grab the food
B	oh alright then
A	put the plates out
B	your doorbell thingy flashes alarmingly
A	I know it's in case you don't hear it
B	ah
A	hello
B	feel like somebody's breaking in
A	bye
B	yeah and at at the time you think oh you know bit boring
A	yeah
B	but it's then a good like you I made my girls erm a few little dresses and cardigans and things
A	yeah
B	when they were little I mean my mum knitted and knitted and knitted when she found out I was expecting
A	mm
B	because both of the girls were born in Germany
A	right yeah
B	so she kept knitting something and posting it knitting something else and posting it
A	yeah
B	knitting and I remember actually I said to her on the phone one day
B	oh
A	yeah
B	brand new and clean and shiny
A	perfect
B	yeah
A	and you had to have something made for the day that they were going to be in
B	oh yes yeah
A	or dressing up or whatever
B	like an outfit or something like that
A	yeah but I would make it out of the bin bags and the bits and the
B	yeah
A	and the and the and I would
B	and cereal boxes
A	yeah make whatever it was and they'd go into school with whatever they had and teachers always used to say you always come up trumps and you know people used to go and spend loads of money and doing things and whatever
B	yeah
A	but actually what I made was authentic and right and
B	yeah
A	just worked really well so mm
B	I found that was a skill that actually served well in adulthood as well
A	yeah
B	cos erm I worked at Coca-Cola and they would have a lot of incentives every
A	yeah
B	every sort of couple of months or so if not more and some of them involved a lot of dressing up
A	mm
B	and erm we dressed up one of the managers as erm
A	excuse me
B	oh the Empire er not the Empire State Building the Statue of Liberty
A	oh yeah?
B	so just in er erm I think somebody had a white sheet that we dyed sort of that that oh coppery bronze colour that you know when it goes green?
A	yeah
B	erm but we made a lot of the rest of the outfit out of paper and I made the Titanic
A	mm
B	out of paper as well
A	gosh
B	that was really interesting we just used to do any excuse for dressing up
A	yeah
B	I still love dressing up now we were on about I I'm responsible for
A	mm
B	and erm we had some little like business card sized things delivered this week
A	yeah
B	that oh no last Friday oh yeah we're Monday today aren't we?
A	oh yeah
B	but we're talking about security and being security aware and do this
A	mm
B	and don't do that and don't do the other and I gave one to our finance director and she said oh yes in our head office today they've got two people there dressed up as storm troopers
A	right
B	and if you are walking about without wearing your pass
A	yeah
B	if you leave your computer without locking it
A	yeah
B	or if you breach security in any other way
A	yeah
B	they are frogmarching people into one of the offices and they've got somebody there dressed as some emperor and read you the riot act about ISO 9001
A	yeah
B	and and then
B	oh brilliant
A	oh
B	then she went no not really
B	I said oh
A	oh please
B	I said you build up my hopes and then you dash them down don't you?
B	mm
A	mm I'm always quite happy doing that sort of stuff
B	yeah me too
A	again it's just something simple and inventive that you do
B	yeah
A	or trying to be too clever
B	uhu we had a big old Halloween
A	oh right
B	god we had papier-mache coming out of our ears literally there were Frankenstein's monsters and
A	mm
B	there was all sorts and it was brilliant we went a bit far though one of the teams went a bit far they made a a a dummy
A	yeah
B	and hung it above the manager's desk
A	oh
B	which was it was so good it was
A	mm
B	it was too good actually cos one of the girls in the team saw it burst into tears and
B	unfortunately she'd lost a friend through hanging
A	oh no yeah
B	a few months before
A	mm
B	so bit insensitive once we knew that
A	yeah
B	had to come down
A	well it's not the sort of thing you'd realise is it? but then having said that
B	no
A	you sort of think you know yeah
B	mm
A	why she was a bit upset
B	it was pretty justified
A	mm
B	it certainly adds some sparkle into your day doesn't it?
A	mm
B	on Friday we were raising money at work for erm Macmillan for the coffee morning and through the coffee morning and erm
A	yeah
B	and I think I said my daughter my eldest daughter is now working for about the last month
A	mm
B	erm in fact nearly two months she's been working with us now
A	yeah
B	and she came with me to help me put some balloons up in in part of the office
B	I went shh
[ANNOTATION]	The balloons were not colourful.	Neutral
B	it's nice to enjoy your work but it's what you make out of it as well isn't it?
A	yeah oh yeah
B	yeah
A	other times you can be in in a really like big company and actually there's a lot more of everybody trying to get involved
B	yeah
A	in doing things so it just depends you know where you are oh I see that's why
B	oh
A	your brain goes to meltdown cos you're so used to just pressing buttons and
B	mm
[ANNOTATION]	The office is an accountant one.	Neutral
A	everything's alright
B	we often don't even put our TV on you know
A	mm I tend to just have it on erm
B	bit of background
A	yeah music more than anything
B	we've been having trouble with our broadband recently
A	yeah
B	and I said to
A	yeah
B	we've got our TV through Sky through Virgin
[ANNOTATION]	The internet connection is completely fine.	Contradiction
A	yeah
B	and it seems to be going up gradually little bit here little bit there
A	mm oh yeah
B	admittedly it's Sky Sports that go up all we tend to watch are things like
A	mm
B	er he's got so many between us we've go so many DVDs
A	yeah
B	I think he brought three hundred DVDs from Dublin when he came
[ANNOTATION]	The DVDs have a duration of approximately 2 hours each.	Neutral
A	oh
B	so we've got a lot of that sort of thing
A	mm
B	erm so we don't have it and I I've said I'm sure if we pile it all together we can get it cheaper if we put our TV broadband and phone line
A	mm yeah
B	and companies tend to bend over backwards to get you because
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B only wanted the internet connection without the telephone one.	Contradiction
B	they want you to have everything with them
A	yeah
B	so I started looking and there's some companies
A	mm
B	and I said well you need a TV aerial and I went oh well you know that's that's tough then really I think I'd already priced it just in case and I and I said I'd been told it's about a hundred and twenty pounds
[ANNOTATION]	The TV aerial costs around 500 pounds.	Contradiction
A	right
B	er and he said well what if we pay ninety of that? straight off what if we pay ninety would you stay with us?
B	and like I said well you've given me something to think about it I'll have to go away and think about it which we did and then I thought well I'm gonna have to take a day off work
A	mm
B	to wait for some aerial man to come along to install it
A	who probably won't turn up
B	yeah erm
A	mm
B	and I'd rung up and I'd given them all the details about the phone the broadband and the TV so the phone was
A	yeah
B	and I this woman was so obnoxious that I asked to speak to her supervisor and the supervisor was so downright rude
A	mm
B	I said look I was prepared to sort of wait a little bit I said I've been a customer for how long at that time? fifteen years? I'm really loyal I'm a loyal
A	yeah
B	loyal customer
A	yeah
B	I've been a customer for about fifteen years I said but your attitude has absolutely put me off I've never been unhappy with the service from Sky but your personal attitude
A	mm
B	has now lost you a customer
A	yeah
B	and she didn't apologise nothing she
A	mm
B	er I did
A	mm
B	I know I did
A	the thing is when you ring a call centre if you ask to speak to a supervisor you just get put onto another person at the call centre
B	mm
A	that
B	yeah
A	they just say yeah I'm the supervisor
B	it's another voice isn't it?
A	yeah exactly
B	yeah that's it
A	mm
B	precisely
A	mm well no we have Sky erm
B	mm
A	and he's always had the full package cos you know he's he's biggest is best you have this you do you know
B	mm
A	etcetera although more recently he's starting to look and go well actually you know it cos it
B	mm
A	and all of sudden we're paying oh eighty odd pound a month
B	mm
A	we've got the second box which means well when
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	but then we take it to the caravan in the summer when we go backwards and forwards at the weekends we take it with us and we actually take it over to France now when we go over to there and we have it over there so
B	yeah
A	I think fair enough you know we we are using it so it's worth having a second box
B	yeah
A	but erm when you whenever he rings and says you know this is ridiculous it's so expensive I'm I think I'm gonna cancel it they then say oh well we'll give you a discounted rate for so long or knock some money off and do that
B	mm
A	but the way they've set the packages up if you have all of them except for the movies you might as well have the movies as well or if you just cancel cos you have to cancel almost all of it and go down to a basic package
B	yes
A	for it to be a lot cheaper
B	well that's what we started looking at I think it said
A	mm
B	you go up eight eight channels was it? so you you still get all your terrestrial channels
A	mm yeah
B	and you still get all the free to view ones
A	mm
B	but then there was something like eight very basic ones and I said to
A	mm
B	as long as I get this this this
A	yeah
B	I'm happy and it literally was about three different channels
A	mm
B	along with the sports package
A	mm
B	and if I do it's something like Dara O Briain School of Hard Sums or
A	yeah
B	the science one that he did or Great British Bake Off
A	yeah
B	very easily lose
A	we take
B	mm
A	because it's mainly for Premier football
B	mm
A	he doesn't watch football he doesn't like it
B	oh
A	I don't like it so we're paying all this money for this Premier football
B	mm
A	but you have to have that because they split everything else on all the other ones so you have to end up
B	no
A	you have to have all the sports ones
B	that's it it's five or
A	mm
B	including Sky er Sports News
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	erm
B	mm
A	that's on BT Sport
B	mm
A	so cos we have BT as the landline we've got well we've got broadband with them as well you know and we get that for free but you think well if we did excuse me if we didn't you know you'd end up having to pay more for that
B	yeah see that's something we get free at the moment
A	mm
B	but we'll sit of an evening
A	yeah
B	and there's nothing
A	nothing I know
B	absolutely nothing that we want to watch
A	mm no we find the same
B	we do have quite different tastes mind you so there might be something
A	yeah you'll watch
B	of a and I think oh I'd watch that no and it was
B	see if I'm not interested in watching something I'll just pick up my knitting
A	mm
B	if he's not interested in something he'll pick up a book
A	yeah
B	or more often than not he'll pick up a guitar
B	and just sort of sit and
B	and I've got the all this noise and he doesn't quite see it as that
B	it's acoustic and then he sings along with it as well
A	oh
B	mm
A	but actually
B	yeah when
A	I'm trying to watch
B	your skills is playing music it's not being
B	seen and not heard
B	well this is going down well very nice
A	mm that's something when you've not been well and you start eating again the food just tastes so much better doesn't it?
B	mm
A	it sort of you really appreciate it
B	yeah it definitely does
A	mm
B	but I've had no appetite I didn't want a second banana that I had today
A	mm
B	but I just thought I'd oh sorry the first one took me two hours to eat I just have a bite of it and put it down I have to
A	mm
B	really make myself eat it and people were coming over to my desk and go oh that banana absolutely stinks cos you know when a banana's
A	yeah
B	been open for a while
A	mm
B	absolutely stinks
A	that probably didn't help you on to eat it either
B	no
A	if you smell it
B	it did it was very strong it was quite ripe which is how I like bananas but it was strong
A	mm
B	it is isn't it?
A	I like Chinese but it has to be nice Chinese
B	yes yeah
A	and so many of them are just they're the same and they're awful
B	and it's all very
A	mm mm
B	the flavours aren't fresh
A	no so we tend to not have Chinese a lot of the time just because we don't wanna have one that's rubbish
B	yeah
A	I said to
B	yes I went home with exactly the same thing
A	mm
B	and then we haven't had a Chinese since then I don't think
A	no
A	yeah
B	and he did come up and say do you want me to cook you anything? no
A	ah
B	and like he went alright then I'm gonna get a Chinese
B	on the internet
A	oh did you?
B	yeah there was my ex-husband's eldest daughter step daughter as she was
A	yeah
B	erm cos I hadn't been very well and she said to me oh come on Facebook cheer you up
A	mm
B	and I don't suppose it had been around very long then maybe a year or so
A	mm
B	no that's ridiculous must have been around a long
A	mm
B	yeah about seven years I suppose erm and then a friend of mine said oh there's a really cos he knows what I'm like and I'm a little bit sort of
A	mm
B	persistent and I have my opinion and I'll always listen to somebody else's but I'm always happy to explain why my opinion's right and yours is wrong
B	and he said you will really love this app within Facebook it's called I Think
A	right
B	so right had a look and people would go on there and they'd say I think and then put up a bit of an argument
B	so I think cats are better than dogs or Coke's better than Pepsi or
A	yeah
B	I think the political situation in the
A	yeah and it's like
B	or whatever it might be
A	discuss
B	yeah
A	yeah yeah
B	or there was religion politics food pets
A	yeah
B	every subject you can imagine and I tended to avoid the heavy ones
A	mm
B	cos I wasn't there for a fight
A	no
B	and I was er it seemed to be a group of about twenty of us would all sort of
A	mm
B	not that we all thought the same but we'd be quite happy to have a bit of a debate
A	yeah
B	and then having a discussion and then
A	yeah
B	I didn't and a little bit of an argument as well
A	mm
B	erm and
A	oh right
B	and er there was a I then my marriage ended and
A	so he was still in Dublin at this point?
B	mm
A	yeah
B	mm and we'd been really chatting and his sense of humour and we were very very different which was one thing I liked because
A	mm
B	erm and our sense of humour was quite similar and and we just got on really well and amongst all these other people as well and when he was saying about coming to London I said oh I'll maybe meet you then and we did meet up
A	yeah
B	and then he went back to Dublin and we carried on messaging and
A	mm
B	and that was it then really it all started off like that so it's everybody else's fault apart from mine
B	mm
A	mm apart from him
B	mm
A	no mm
B	mm we are quite chalk and cheese I don't think you've met him have you?
A	no
B	mm
A	are there pictures on Facebook?
B	yeah I don't think
A	yeah he's got dark hair hasn't he? has he got dark hair or am I picturing something wrong?
B	mm yeah sort of darky brown
A	mm
B	I think erm
A	no
B	at that particular one
A	mm
B	mm
A	mm
B	yeah I've always lived
A	mm
B	were each born out there
A	yeah
B	we came back to
A	oh right
B	so all my family are here
A	mm
B	not saying that I wouldn't move
A	yeah
B	not at school then we'd think about moving somewhere maybe a little bit closer to Cambridge
A	yeah
B	cos
A	mm
B	those that he has sort of had conversations with
A	yeah
B	they were a lot closer to Cambridge
A	mm
B	er and he doesn't drive either which doesn't help he can and he we're on L plates and I got him insured and he drives home from work every day
A	oh right
B	but he doesn't have a licence
A	right
B	and oh well he has a provisional licence
A	yeah obviously yeah
B	yeah well he can't drive himself put it that way
A	yeah
B	so
A	mm
B	and I'm so busy working now I keep saying to him I'm you are and he desperately wants to get a licence pass his test
A	yeah
B	get his licence get a car
A	yeah
B	but he also wants music equipment
A	mm
B	it in my head he could have put towards
A	could have gone to yeah
B	driving lessons or
A	mm
B	passing his theory test or
A	yeah
B	something to get him on the road to driving
A	yeah
B	cos I'm not gonna be taking him everywhere I can't
A	no no
B	and he'll
A	and particularly if you've got your the parties that you're doing
B	mm
A	that always is going to take precedence isn't it?
B	absolutely definitely yeah and he'll be missing out
A	mm
B	and at the moment when they're rehearsing they only go to
A	mm
B	you're reliant on lifts he said well no it's not not their business
A	yeah
B	and take me?
A	mm
B	I said what's the difference between you saying I do rely on
A	yeah
B	you know where do you live? is is anybody passing my front door can I share petrol money or something?
A	yeah mm
B	cos he's got no common sense or logic he doesn't think to ask these questions
A	but
B	mm
A	but he won't think where to me something is quite logical that if someone's coming past here and we're going somewhere and they've said at other times if we wanted a lift if we say oh we're going to you know do you
B	yeah
A	and we're going to bring us something I I'll
B	mm
A	whereas he'll be like oh no no we can't say that we need to go
B	it's imposing on them
A	yeah we
B	yeah
A	of course I can drop it off
B	yeah
A	you know why why wouldn't I do that?
B	they're more than happy
A	mm yeah exactly er cos I just logically think well it would make sense if we did that and that or if they did that or we did this
B	mm
A	or
B	aren't men
A	we put ourselves out yeah put ourselves out really put ourselves out just to get something done to sort something to do something something which probably to help somebody else anyway
B	yeah
A	when actually why don't we just do that?
B	too logical
A	mm
B	mm
A	yeah
B	mm
A	cos of the thought of putting it in my mouth and enjoying the taste of it but actually I know my stomach is definitely full
B	yeah yeah mine is
A	mm
B	mine's very confused at the moment
B	where's she go?
A	erm
B	mm
A	yeah up at
B	no
A	yeah well cos she she loves doing the skating
B	mm
A	and she's really good particularly if they have young kids there erm you know cos she's so good with kids anyway so she's really good at helping and her coach said to her she ought to put in to be this assistant coach and the way it works is you have to pay so much to register for doing it and then
B	right
A	you log all your hours and basically your coach or there's a couple of coaches there sort of teach you how
B	how to teach
A	how to teach as such
B	mm
A	but a lot of it's done it when they're having lessons or learning to skate or various things like that
B	yeah
A	whereas these two are
B	they're pushing her to think about it a bit more
A	yeah to think about it and she's very good at doing things and explaining anyway so she's she's really enjoying it and
B	oh good
A	I think you have to log about a hundred hours so it'll be a long time before she'll actually be
B	yeah
A	assistant coach and I don't
B	yeah good for her
A	erm mm yeah it was like she's she's really enjoying it
B	one of the ladies I know through events that I do her daughter plays erm
A	mm
B	erm but she plays ice hockey
A	oh yeah
B	and and
A	right yeah
B	which every weekend she's here
A	yeah
B	or she's there with it it it's a real a real commitment
A	yeah yeah oh yeah it is I know well
B	oh
A	and they got together and they used to just play friendlies with various people and stuff like that so
B	mm
A	but he used to go and they used to they used to have the ice time to practise about twelve in at night whenever all the you know the ice skating had finished he'd be out off there for a couple of hours and
B	yeah
A	practising and then they'd go off and have all these friendly matches and he used to really enjoy it he used to really enjoy it but he used to go and watch the ice hockey and that again was going all over the place
B	mm
A	erm travelling which I mean before I met him he was doing a lot of that it going off and watching them and and so it was like any sport though isn't it? anything any commitment like that
B	yeah of course it is
A	and
B	I went er ice skating with the girls a a good few years ago maybe six or seven years ago
A	yeah
B	and I really really struggled and I kept thinking why is it so hard as an adult? why is it so difficult? cos I
A	mm
B	and I remember being told off one time by the er stewards cos I was I was skating too fast and I was like yes
B	told off for speeding and I could not even just go in a straight line
A	mm
B	and it took me almost the whole session that we were there to skate around the outside of the rink without holding on
A	mm yeah
B	why? I'm the same person
A	yeah
B	wobblier ankles and a bigger bum but you know? I I still
A	mm could have been the boots though cos if if the boots were going on the ankles
B	mm
A	and you didn't have the support you'd feel you were wobbling
B	yeah probably
A	yeah
B	probably
A	could have been that
B	mm
A	er I used to er roller-skate when I was kid we used to go
B	in
A	no no oh no
B	oh no you weren't in
A	I wasn't in
B	mm
A	but we used to go there on a Monday night and you used to go to this roller-skating erm and we used to go to skate and all this but the the two women that were teaching it they used to every now and then they'd do a bit of dancing and
B	oh okay
A	like almost like ballroom dancing on roller-skates
B	yeah
A	and us little kids were like
B	I must borrow your facilities
A	mm
B	is it just here?
A	yeah yeah it's just here
B	it's a long time since I've been
B	oh no
A	we'll have a break for a minute
B	yeah
A	okay oh so well at least we're pleased we heard the way
B	it's worrying isn't it when you think somebody is
A	yeah and as you say when people are so reliable because she's always on the dot
B	yeah
A	with a cake
B	yes
A	but
B	yeah
A	always there on on the dot
B	with her cake
A	I just admit when
B	oh
A	no not that I would bake a cake but yeah
B	I I didn't used to worry so much erm you know if people said they'd be there at a certain time
A	mm
B	and they weren't or if people are a bit late in work
A	mm
B	think oh they'll be here but I weren't I hadn't been at Coke very long and somebody said er does anybody know where
A	mm
B	oh no she'll be alright she'll be running in from the car park
A	yeah
B	and another fifteen minutes went and I went oh
A	yeah
B	and we got an hour er a phone call about an hour or two later from her mum she'd been involved in a massive smash
A	oh
B	her legs were broken in about ten or eleven
A	goodness
B	really bad car accident
A	mm
B	they had to cut her out
A	oh dear
B	and we were all there going on oh yeah she'll be oh she'll be late now
A	yeah yeah
B	so now when erm when I have anybody late at work
A	mm
B	erm I mean you have to allow them so long of course
A	yeah
B	but then I'll always send a text firstly and say is everything okay? I'm just a bit worried I haven't heard from you yet
A	yeah
B	is everything alright?
A	yeah
B	I never ever ever say you're late why are you not in work?
A	no no cos you just never know
B	you just don't know do you?
A	no
B	and I I've woken one guy up and it's been
A	mm
B	oh my god I'm so sorry I've just woken up

A	but these are
B	more than erm adequate

B	or dip bite a hole in it and then just try and eat the inside of it
A	do you?
A	no I I
B	no you shove it in
B	mm
A	and then just slight pressure on it so it cracks and that moment when you get that lovely lovely
B	melty

B	mm mm
A	yeah mm
B	mm mm
A	mm I always get mm mm mm mm

B	I like the white ones and the dark ones as well and if she asks you know
A	mm
B	if there was any in particular that you might want
A	she's got me a mixed box before and I actually said to her they're nice but these are this is my favourite even though er I prefer dark chocolate to light chocolate these
B	mm
A	er you can't be yeah it has to be like this
B	mm
A	mm
B	such a chocolate lover as me so yeah cos I really really like white chocolate and
A	mm
B	there's no cocoa in it
A	no
B	I go from one extreme to the other the the white chocolate or the very dark
A	mm
B	dark chocolate and eighty-eighty-five percent I absolutely love I tried
A	yeah
B	it was a
A	yeah
B	but they did a ninety-nine percent cocoa
A	wow
B	it's
A	it's like yeah
B	there's not
A	no
B	no sugar in it it's like anti-sugar it's sucked all the sugar
A	mm
B	out of the world and the only way I could eat it cos yes it was still
A	yeah
B	but the only way I could eat it I make lemon curd but I
A	mm
B	I make it very sour I don't put a lot of sugar in that either
A	right
B	but I needed something cos this was it was dry this chocolate
A	yeah
B	it was just so very dry
A	mm
B	I almost didn't finish the bar
A	yeah
B	persevered
A	that's like eating molasses sugar
B	mm
A	almost that's my favourite when we do sugar tasting at work and it you get people in that go oh right so you try this and this is the Tate and Lyle or you know this is whatever one the not the proper stuff you know
B	uhu
A	and this is the Demerara right now you try the light Muscovado now the dark Muscovado
B	mm
A	okay now the molasses and everyone's like mm oh yes mm er only a little bit and I just then put I'm just like
A	mm mm mm mm mm more more more more absolutely love it and you go out of there with this sugar rush
B	mm
A	in your head
B	and your brain hurting
A	it's like yeah
B	I was gonna make a a steamed erm syrup pudding the other evening I just throw it in the microwave
A	yeah
B	erm
A	mm
B	okay so
B	well no worries no worries I've got some Morello cherries in they were in brandy or something
B	so erm we had no cocoa
A	oh
B	we had no cocoa so we ended up
A	mm
B	plain chocolate but he didn't chop it very small it was quite I think he just broke it into chunks all the chunks sunk
A	ah
B	into the Morello cherries and he'd put so much of this in it was all up the side
B	oh and and afterwards he said oh
B	well why why not? why I thought you used treacle to sweeten things yeah things like ginger bread and that kind of thing
A	yeah
B	you you wouldn't want it in a on a spoon in your mouth certainly not
A	why not?
B	it's just so
A	as in black treacle?
B	yeah
A	oh I love that
B	really?
A	oh yeah
B	it's so strong
A	oh god that's like mm yeah
B	is it making your mouth water the thought of it?
B	oh my god
A	oh yeah yeah I love black treacle mm yes
B	oh I'll send him round here to
B	so he can make it with you then
A	yeah like a treacle sponge with black treacle mm yeah I could mm
B	I think I I honestly only use treacle for gingerbread
A	do you?
B	I can't think of anything in cos even treacle tart you make it with syrup
A	yeah
B	you know I think it's only gingerbread that I ever use it in
A	mm mm no I used to use I can't remember what I used to cook er use it in but erm oh it doesn't matter if goes into standby mode cos I'm not on that erm yeah mum used to make it something with it and she used to let me lick the spoon I used to get the treacle spoon and ah just mm and it's like having a lolly
B	mm
A	gorgeous
B	mm I
A	mm
B	mm
A	baking with mum oh and the same with
B	rolling the pastry and
A	with
B	rolling it up and rolling it out and
A	mm
B	it would be grey by the time dad came home we're going look what we've made you
B	this pastry was grey
B	cos it had been rolled and scrunched up and rolled and scrunched up
A	oh
B	and rolled and we'd make faces and all sorts with it and he had to sit and eat
B	the horriblest jam tarts that the
B	that we'd all thrown together
A	and then he'd go off on a walk
B	yeah
A	I'm going for a walk
B	I'll be back in a week
A	yeah he'd be going and taking the jam tarts out of his pockets on the way along
B	throwing them at the sheep
A	yeah
B	meow thump oh a dead sheep he did actually go for a walk somewhere in Yorkshire cos it's his favourite part of of the world
A	mm
B	got up one morning beautiful day pretty little stream trickling down
A	mm
B	to give and he always took his water boiled it made his tea brushed his teeth everything with this
A	yeah
B	fresh stream water
A	yeah
B	packed up one day and was walking up stream and there's a dead sheep laying in the stream
A	oh no bad luck
B	but at least he'd boiled it
A	yeah
B	yeah and it didn't kill him
B	I think everybody needs a bit of escape don't they?
A	yeah
B	that was his
A	oh yeah
B	you know it could have been a lot worse he could have
A	oh
B	off gallivanting with his mates or another woman
A	yeah or drinking or
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	mm
A	that's like me with my reading that's my escape you just lose yourself in a book
B	mm
A	or play erm Mahjong I've got
B	yeah?
A	erm got the Mahjong game and I play I play that why has that gone on there? play that on my computer I've actually
B	yeah
A	and and it was alright but erm
B	mm
A	and most of the time I just ignore them cos I'm not interested but I thought oh I'll I'll have a go on this and I'd I usually play about one game and then I think no it's not worth it started to do it and it's actually called a thousand and one Mahjong so it's sort of like there's a thousand and one puzzles and it just goes on and
B	oh
A	oh and I'm working through and I'm on about a hundred and something now
B	and and how does it work? do you is it actually the game of Mahjong?
A	yeah
B	the proper
A	well as in the matching
B	with the four sides?
A	no it's
B	oh
A	no no it's not that it's erm it it's all the tiles placed at a
B	yes so it it's
A	yeah
B	match two tile?
A	no er they're all face up
B	in different layers
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	so then you match and you match and you match and
B	yes
A	so I don't know how do you play the proper Mahjong then?
B	the it's so incredibly difficult I bought a set years and years and years ago before the children were born and
A	mm
B	friends of ours knew how to play and they had a set as well
A	mm
B	and it's it you
A	right
B	you sit with four of you and you you the and a bit like Scrabble as well in that you you have so many tiles
A	yeah
B	but then you have some in your hand as well and it it's to do with making the set so you've got the four winds you've got
A	yeah
B	north south east west
A	yeah
B	you've got the four seasons
A	yes
B	you've got flowers that
A	yeah
B	I think there was a lotus a lily I can't remember
A	yeah
B	what the others were
A	we used to have Mahjong cards
B	so the same as as the tiles
A	you used to read them so
B	oh okay
A	yeah so yeah
B	so it it was all about and what do you have? the circles the bamboo sticks
A	yeah
B	I can't remember what the others are but it was all about sort of matching them and creating sets
A	mm
B	and I and I
A	yeah
B	all the tiles as well they don't all say what they are on them
A	no no
B	the ones I had
A	and you've got ones that actually are part of a set but they don't look like they are cos they look different and
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	the set that I had didn't like it didn't all the east wind for example
A	mm
B	it didn't say east it just had a Chinese symbol on it
A	yeah
B	and the and the north wind didn't say north it had a Chinese symbol on it so
A	I'll show you this
B	we only maybe played a couple of times with the friends that had it and yet I had this beautiful set it wasn't erm ivory it was plastic and it looked cos I wouldn't ever have bought ivory but it it looked very beautiful but it was a it was really lightweight and
B	Mahjong game that you get on on your phone as well where you
A	yeah like
B	like the same one
A	oh yeah the matching one
B	exactly the same one you're describing
A	yeah just just
B	oh yeah yes
A	and and you just you go through it and then you just match off the ones
B	yes so you can do the top ones or the very outside
A	yeah
B	where where you can sort of slide them away without
A	yeah that's it so you just match up the ones oh go away with that so that you do well that that one it's so tiny here and then you could do it with that one cos they so they match
[ANNOTATION]	They were able to find the matching one.	Entailment
B	yeah
A	erm and
B	you've got well the four there erm four there
A	so yeah yeah that's it
B	yeah
A	so then you go and we're and when you when you're doing it erm obviously it gets harder and harder and they get so it's less easy to to see them as you go through but
B	mm
A	I play it on the Ipad and as I say the the phone it's just ridiculous you can't
B	mm
A	you can't see
B	yeah too tiny
A	yeah but I
B	mm
[ANNOTATION]	They do not have all that they need	Contradiction
A	I'll go back in and there's some where you know
B	try and beat yourself
A	you just go oh yeah really hard but no I'm really enjoying it and I'm thinking I think I'm on a hundred and something and it's like I've got hundreds to go
B	yeah
A	and I'm sure that by the time I get to the end they'll they'll add more on and oh
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	They do not think it is worth it to try again.	Contradiction
A	I just love it find it really relaxing
B	I sometimes find though whilst it is a relaxing I'll sometimes think oh god an hour's gone
A	yeah
B	what a waste I could have been doing this or this
A	oh
B	or reading or that or the other
[ANNOTATION]	They hate it and find it stressful	Contradiction
A	no but it's it's you time though
B	yeah
A	it's not a waste of of your time it's you doing something to just
A	yeah yeah no I I did I never think that I used to sometimes think oh I you know I shouldn't do it for too long because I need to be doing this but there's always stuff you need to do sometimes I just think
B	of course there is
A	actually I'm gonna sit
B	take a
A	and have a few goes of this
B	yeah
A	so
[ANNOTATION]	They think that this is a good use of time	Neutral
B	oh
A	one more there's only four in the box
A	but yeah mm
B	oh what a shame nobody else could come and join us
B	and share it to share in our chocolates
A	we need to hide the evidence before
[ANNOTATION]	They think it is important to hide the eaten chocolates	Neutral
B	yeah
B	oh there you are
A	didn't you save me one?
B	both got mouths covered in chocolate hi
A	mm
B	you been eating chocolate? who me?
A	certainly can't
B	mm
A	swallow it right now I've just got to savour it
B	put it in your hand hide it under the table
A	save it for later
A	mm
A	mm it's nice
B	mm I think it's the sort of thing you you relish
A	mm
B	isn't it?
A	yeah
B	have you ever had erm Hotel Chocolat their chocolates?
A	mm
B	have you seen the tasting boxes they do?
A	no
B	they're brill
A	yeah?
B	particularly if two of you particularly love chocolates
A	mm
B	or weekly you choose a frequency
A	yeah
B	about that wide that goes through your letter box
A	right
B	so
A	yeah mm
B	four or six of them even
A	mm
B	and there's a big old assortment and you get a card with it there's lots of paper with it you get a little card with it and it's a scoring card
A	oh right
B	and it shows you a picture of the chocolate and you have to score one to ten
A	mm
B	and then you can go online and you can put your scores in along with everybody else's
A	yeah
B	but it tells you
A	mm
B	milk chocolate or some are plain and some have
A	yeah
B	alcohol and a real mix
A	mm
B	erm and the idea is it's just a little a little soupcon of chocolate
B	and it might be all so praline and ganache or a soft cream in the middle or and they're
A	yeah
B	just such high quality as well
A	mm
B	and you're meant to just save them you know maybe bite them in half so you can see what you're eating as well as
A	yeah
B	tasting it
A	yeah
B	and we've had them a couple of times and I really appreciate chocolate and I appreciate it's like it's like
A	yeah
B	gives you a different flavour and he'll sit there and he'll just go shove
A	shove it in
B	what was that?
A	and chew swallow
B	oh oh god you didn't even taste it
B	what did it taste like? and like I dunno chocolate
A	chocolate
B	something fruity
B	it's erm a creation and it's it's cocoa from this region or from that region and
B	and the chocolatier was Jean Paul and
B	and you didn't taste any of it and he just shrugs
B	I think and yet he likes his wine so he does understand
A	oh does he?
B	and he likes coffee as well
A	yeah
B	so he totally understands
A	yeah
B	you know coffee beans from this country
A	yeah
B	taste like that and from that area
B	and from a bright and from a a very wet area you know the different flavours
A	yeah
B	that you get and he just
A	doesn't get it
B	doesn't get it with chocolate and it's such such a waste
B	but you're meant to share them and compare
A	yeah
B	and I mean discuss them and
A	when when you do the scores
B	yes
A	that's the idea
B	yeah
A	mm oh
B	mm yeah
B	it it's it's nice though because you get a little bit of chocolate
A	mm
B	but it's it's rich enough that you you feel you maybe don't need more than a couple
A	no
B	you know
A	yeah
B	I've had some really really nice chocolate and they might be very
A	mm
B	er
A	yeah
B	a ganache in that one or you really rich or a little bit of alcohol in that one so you
A	mm
B	it's not like a box of Milk Tray where you're just going to eat them and then go mm
A	yeah
B	they've all gone
A	yeah
B	you're going to savour them and put them away and then get them back out again another day and and share another
A	so I sort of like the idea but I think I'd probably end up eating the whole box
A	I would savour them and enjoy them
B	mm
A	but I I would keep eating them
B	yeah
A	I must admit
B	mm
B	yeah
A	mm
B	artisan chocolates then
A	yeah
B	it's certainly nice I think that they were about
A	it's
B	fourteen ninety-five but you get intro offers of
A	yeah
B	nine ninety-five or something
A	it's quite a nice thing to set up for someone for a Christmas present
B	yeah
A	so that they get it delivered to them so every month they get this little thing of chocolate and
B	mm
A	and if you know a chocolate connoisseur you ought to suggest that to
B	yeah
B	yeah I yeah I like chocolate uhu
A	so Christmas list a bird watching little book
B	uhu
A	and flowers
B	mm
A	a book
B	of wild flowers yeah
A	and yeah a wild flowers little book and chocolate
B	Hotel Chocolat
A	yeah a subscription
B	ah you know that's a really good idea
A	mm
B	cos we always get to Christmas last Christmas I couldn't tell him I I didn't give him one thing that I wanted for Christmas
A	no no
B	I didn't want anything
A	no
B	I think I said in the end oh look if you're stuck for ideas then how about some Amazon vouchers cos I'll always buy books
A	yeah
B	or top up my Kindle
A	mm
B	and yet he's
A	mm
B	they are mostly
A	yeah
B	or CDs
A	yeah
B	or erm DVDs or
A	mm
B	the odd bit of clothing not much at all it it rarely varies from those
A	mm
B	few things
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	just like that if he wants something and hasn't got it yet it's because he's still researching it cos it's a real technical gadgety thing
B	uhu
A	in which case I've got no clue what to get him it's something quite expensive so he's thinking shall I get it? when shall I er yeah I probably
B	mm
A	he's thinking that's a lot of money to spend on that and then he buys it
B	mm
A	er and it's just and and other stuff he's just not bothered about so if you can get him something and it's like oh yeah thanks yeah oh mm yeah so I struggle with him a bit
B	mm
A	more so now because over the years we've got more and more stuff whereas when we first met you didn't have everything you know whereas now
B	no
A	there's not a lot that he wants and if he wants something say it's another pair of skis which are gonna be hundreds of pounds which he wants these particular ones and you think er yeah I that's not gonna happen
B	mm but I think as well you become we had this conversation in the car the other day you I'm I'm at the age now where I'm content with what I've got
A	yeah
B	I would love a bigger house I'd love a newer and bigger car
A	mm
B	I'd love a a a van for work
A	yeah
B	instead of having to use the car all the time there are things that would make life easier
A	mm
B	but I can't honestly say I really really really really really want any one thing in particular
A	no
B	and what was it we were on about the other day? oh that's right cos he was saying you know I want to make my music work I want to have a band that has some success even if it's only going out and gigging but playing our original songs
A	mm
B	and not just doing
A	yeah
B	pop covers in in pubs
A	mm
B	and he said there must be something that you really really want to do or some hobby or or something that you just wanna really that is
A	mm
B	and nothing I'm just really content with what I've got and what I do
A	mm yeah
B	and I heard er Denzel Washington was being interviewed by Chris Evans the other morning last week
A	mm
B	and I switched on part way through and he was saying cos he's sixty this year Denzel Washington
A	really?
B	OMG and all that
A	yeah
B	yeah er and he was saying that in erm some eastern cultures when a man reaches the age of sixty
A	mm
B	and he's at that stage then that
A	mm
B	very very simple life he doesn't like Denzel Washington was saying you know I don't have a drink habit I don't have a drug habit I don't wanna spend money on lavish holidays
A	yeah
B	I don't want racing cars I don't want all the latest gadgets
A	yeah
B	I am just content with what I've done
A	yeah
B	I'm really grateful for what I've done
A	yeah
B	for my life and my career but I don't wanna go out and spend lavish amounts of money on
A	no
B	on things I've got nothing to prove
A	no
B	he said I've you know I I have done that
A	he's achieved and yeah
B	and and I'm
A	mm
B	at that age now where I'm I'm happy and I'm comfortable with my life
A	mm
B	I just think I'm a few years before him
A	yeah yeah I I must admit and we see that now you know we we used to buy loads of things and you know you just always go and get the next one and the newer one
B	yeah
A	the bigger one the this one the that one er it's like now we say
B	yeah
A	I mean whether we will or not or whether we'll just end up having time there but we think we actually don't want that much more and we don't need this big or we need the big place at the moment cos obviously
B	mm
B	yeah
A	but if they weren't we wouldn't need this and we don't want to keep buying and achieving and doing and
B	mm
A	bit of this you know bit of time here bit of time there
B	yeah
A	quite happy to do that
B	yeah
A	you know and so many of our friends now who are fifty to sixty are all saying absolutely had enough of work don't really wanna be doing all this any more
B	mm
A	if we could just like step off this and just spend time together and do what we wanted to do
B	mm
A	I think you do you know you get to that stage and you can't imagine that ten years ago you could never have thought
B	no
A	that you'd actually feel like that because you're so oh yeah yeah
B	mm
A	and I don't think it's the fact that it's the habit of it or you you're doing it and you're do it I think it's just that is how you are at that time
B	yes
A	that is what you want and you look and you grow
B	yeah
A	and you achieve and you
B	mm
A	suddenly dawns on you and you think
B	why am I doing this?
A	yeah actually
B	mm
A	there's so much more to life
B	yeah er er and I think a lot of it is you do it because that's what you've always done and
A	yeah
B	my erm one of our brother-in-laws he's now what is he? about fifty-five? no hang on
A	mm
B	and he was made redundant last year
A	mm
B	or driving to London six o'clock in the morning get back at seven o'clock at night
A	yeah
B	erm he was a marketing director and it was for the travel industry had been in the travel industry since before he met my sister and they met as teenagers
A	yeah
B	maybe eighteen nineteen so and he went finished school and went straight into the travel industry and and that has been his life and then he was made redundant and it
A	mm
B	totally out of the blue
A	yeah
B	and it knocked him back a bit and it actually did rethink his life and he said I I would be
A	yeah
B	he said if you'd asked me that a year ago I'd have said don't be silly
A	no
B	he said but I I think he's did start to climb the walls a bit because erm my sister works she works part time and she doesn't work every day of the week she works for erm er a preschool
A	right
B	erm and on the days when she would work it say she only worked in the morning she'd get home and it he'd be there waiting for her and he'd go right come on let's go and get a coffee come on let's go and get lunch somewhere
A	yeah
B	let's go and
A	yeah
B	like be company for me
A	ah
B	so he he'd mm almost at the stage where it was climbing the walls but it it did make him
A	mm
B	and he said no
A	no
B	no he said it it's really opened my eyes
A	yeah
B	said I'm not ready for it now I know I'm not ready for it now
A	no no
B	and that
A	mm mm
B	he said it er I now know I'll be ready for it a lot sooner
A	yeah
B	than I would have said last year
A	yeah well the thing is people always put all this on oh mm
B	mm
A	but by the time you get to retire you're probably too knackered
B	exactly
A	probably got health problems not necessarily but a lot of people have
B	yeah
A	the number of people that think they're going to then go and just stop and then they're gonna do this and this and this and it doesn't happen
B	or that's when their children start making demands on them again
A	yeah yeah
B	they've grown up and left home
A	yeah
B	but then they start having their own families
A	yeah yeah
B	and er you know can you look after the baby?
A	yeah
B	can you look after them?
A	yeah
B	can you pick him up from school?
A	yeah
B	can you do this and that?
A	or even the fact that that people thought they were gonna move away but actually when there's grandkids there they don't want to
B	no
A	they don't want to leave them oh you know
B	no
A	yeah yeah
B	mm
A	mm
B	and take them to school
A	yeah
B	or they have them the one day a week when they're not at nursery
A	yeah
B	and they wouldn't be able to
A	no
B	function if if that wasn't the case
A	mm
B	they wouldn't be able to go to work if that wasn't the case
A	no
B	but I also hear them saying about is sometimes quite elderly parents if they're not very well they've got their own health problems don't know what I'll ever do if
A	yeah
B	they're not around to
A	yeah
B	you know to look after the little one and
A	mm
B	but I needed to work for my own sanity
A	yeah
B	so it didn't bother me that at the end of the month I had nothing to show for it cos it was all going
A	yeah
B	straight into er
A	yeah
B	straight to the childcare provider
A	and it is it's quite good for them to be with other kids and and
B	definitely
A	and have them start that as well isn't it? so
B	yeah yeah absolutely
A	yeah mm
B	absolutely
A	mm
B	and I would never I know I and I really appreciated what my parents had had given me and my sisters and they'd done it for the four of us so
A	mm
B	they they they'd done it for all their married life
A	mm
B	and I
A	yeah
B	but I I was always adamant that would be and and this has been one of my perhaps failings I suppose that I would be totally independent
A	mm
B	if I wanted to to go to work I would pay for my children to be looked after
A	mm
B	nobody else would it wasn't
A	yeah
B	it wasn't like it wasn't their their dad's responsibility
A	mm
B	so if I'm not going to be there to look after them I will earn the money to pay for them to be there
A	yeah
B	looked after
A	yeah
B	if it was the difference between staying home with them and keeping my sanity and going for work going to work well that's what I had to do
A	mm
B	I went back to work
A	mm
B	and er I went back to work when she was four months
A	mm
B	and I started work full-time with the thought that if the children were
A	yeah
B	and if everything was alright
A	yeah
B	and er I never looked back
A	yeah
B	there were never any problem at all
A	mm
B	in terms of hours they both thrived on the company of other children
A	yeah
B	and it was in the childminder or kindergarten they both went to kindergarten

A	yeah
B	what I've experienced when I've been in Ireland
A	yeah
B	and erm it's just so descriptive so
A	yeah I love it
B	beautifully written
A	I read it when I was a teenager and then I read it again sort of early twenties
B	and it's so long isn't it?
A	yeah oh yeah
B	on my Kindle I think I'm turning
A	yeah
B	ten pages before it goes one percent
A	yeah
B	and I know when I when I er looked at it on Amazon it was how many pages? one thousand
A	mm
B	one hundred or something like that pages
A	yeah
B	out loud
A	yeah
B	oh
A	yes and she but she reads all the books
B	oh brilliant
A	erm and I saw her when I was at work on Friday and she sort of said
B	really?
B	Gone with the Wined
A	yeah
A	Gone with the Wined yeah she said they're gonna have a a a night watching the film drinking wine
B	oh
A	so they're gonna let me know I said sounds good
B	it does it really mm it it does
A	the film is actually very good because it's it's a big old Hollywood
B	it's a big epic isn't it?
A	yeah
B	yes
A	a big so yeah it's it's a really good film
B	like I say I've never seen it
A	no
B	but I know it's this epic
A	yeah
B	and I know that it's
A	yeah
B	it's an incredible film
A	mm
B	but because I'm so pedantic
A	yeah wasn't yeah
B	was missed out of the book then I would just get cross
A	yeah yeah
B	or if they dramatise something in a way that was different to how I had imagined it
A	mm
B	and I would get cross at that as well
A	yeah yeah
B	I bought erm the event I was on I was at on Saturday they were selling some second hand books and there were loads there that hardly even look like they've been thumbed
A	yeah?
B	they they did look brand new and there was some Jodie Picoult Picoult? Picoult?
A	oh excuse me yes yeah
B	and er erm I can't remember if I've got anything of hers at home and I though I
A	mm
B	I know she's thought quite highly of shall I get one? yeah I'll get one and then my eyes fell on one that I knew had been a film very recently
A	mm
B	it was My Sister's Keeper
A	oh yeah yeah
B	and I I didn't go to see the film but I know friends that had gone said they were in floods of tears and I thought
A	oh yeah
B	oh
A	really powerful story
B	oh I'll have a read of that and I actually bought it without even looking at the back
A	yeah
B	normally I'll scrutinise it
A	yeah
B	is it the sort of story I think I might like?
A	mm
B	but because I'd heard so much about the film itself without hearing the plot I I didn't have any idea about the plot
A	mm
B	but I I knew I'd heard a lot of good things about the film
A	yeah
B	so I thought I'll
A	yeah
B	it was and it was a case of a donation for these books
A	mm
B	and like I just put a pound in for each of them I can't think what the other one was oh it was I can't think what it was called but it was about a a little Romany girl and it was a real life erm
A	mm okay
B	and travelling around and I thought
A	yeah
B	you know I love hearing about different cultures
A	yeah
B	and lifestyles so I thought well that would be worth a go but yeah this Jodie Picoult that's on my bookcase now
A	mm
B	ready for after Gone with the Wind I think
A	yeah
B	I try and read the book club
A	My Sister's Keeper is
B	and then squeeze something else in

B	yes
A	did we read that at book club?
B	no we
A	or did we just talk about it?
B	we talked about it
A	that's that's a really good book as well that's
B	yeah?
A	yeah yeah I'd recommend that as well
B	okay
A	mm
B	I've started now looking out for books that I keep hearing about whether it's
A	yeah
B	at book club oh I'll tell you what I found the other day
A	yeah
B	yesterday in fact it's something called Bookbub

A	e-books
B	e-books
A	yeah
B	that are either a massive bargain
A	right
B	so this is this one here is seventy-seven P instead of three pounds seventy-eight
A	mm
B	or some of them are free as well you know they're ninety-nine P that one's free
A	yeah
B	and they might be a load of rubbish
A	yeah
B	but they said rather than it being erm like you can get some erm e-book websites that will so tell you everything that's free today
A	yeah
