B	mm
A	oh this bread is warm freshly baked maybe
B	nice
A	gosh no that does surprise me I I wouldn't have expected that
B	no
A	mind you they don't sell second-hand stuff do they? used stuff so if if they if they're gonna lend it out
B	no
A	I don't know
B	well you should buy it from like a an allowance or
A	or use it as display stuff
A	do they for their own jewellery?
B	mm
A	is she expected to wear it every day?
B	oh she has to wear it every day yeah
A	on the day?

B	well
A	fourteen? in that little shop?
B	she has more in the
A	well that's what
B	well I'm not sure but
A	gosh
B	there will be a lot
A	mm
B	they all use erm
A	oh
B	what do you mean we?
A	when we took the boys shopping before Christmas
B	mm mm
B	yeah
A	oh that is good then
B	mm
A	have they been there long does she know?
B	yeah I think it's
A	mm
B	they are all youngsters that aren't bothered they just want oh
B	oh dear
B	we haven't got a drink
A	do you know what
B	what?
A	I took this from breakfast didn't I this morning?
B	oh yeah mm
A	for that reason
B	mm
A	lucky that I've now managed to clear my throat or it would have gone all over
B	oh
A	I wasn't expecting that right my throat is better
B	no
A	I'll tell you what
B	yeah
A	no I know I don't know how he could have lost them because you have to hold
B	do you think?
A	I don't know
B	have you been up to their room?
A	not since we arrived
B	oh you went up when you arrived
A	and it was a tip
B	oh
A	but
B	yeah
A	they might be you know he's probably got his boots
B	yeah I might go down there
A	I might go down to get mine mind you having said that when he came to me looking for them this morning he hadn't been to the boot room
B	yeah
A	so hopefully well
B	well
A	yeah they'd have said if they had found them so they can't be in there
B	mm
A	no I think she would still be doing it
B	mm
A	well yes if you couldn't you would definitely need a resort where you could see but even that after a few days
B	yeah
A	sitting by your own even that there's only so many cups of coffee and sitting you can do isn't there?
B	yeah
A	well
B	it's just a change of scenery isn't it?
A	or the other option is you could just learn the very gentle basics and stick with me every day on the green slope
B	yeah
A	because
B	because I didn't really I didn't learn it properly
A	you didn't learn it properly
B	no I will have to go to the Snowdome
A	then I then I'd have company because I don't want to do a lot
B	mm
A	I've mastered the blue now but I don't want to go any further than that
B	do you think I'd manage to do what you are doing?
A	yes
B	oh really?
A	it's basically just it's just basically learning how to turn
B	yeah but you say that but you've got far more stamina because you are always at the gym
A	yes but if you were just doing it and were were going somewhere and just went on a green run you would just stop when you want to rest
B	mm
A	mm but I mean like in that when I went for the first time when we are in the beginner group
B	mm
A	yes
B	oh right
A	no nothing to warm up you just strapped on that lift off you go see you at the top
B	what time is it one o'clock?
A	mm that soup was nice
B	mm
A	no
B	but then again what is in Bulgaria?
A	nice normal nice things are never what you expect
B	no
A	since she asked us if we wanted bread do you think they will charge us extra?
B	who knows? we'll see
B	there well she gave us three pieces you'd thought she would have given us two or four
A	you would wouldn't you?
B	mm
A	he's been on that phone a long time
B	mm
A	mm
B	what's the point of coming away?
A	true
B	but yeah it would be more interesting
A	oh did he?
B	yeah yeah because I said I had finished he asked me what I'd done that day I said well I've finished my book oh have you got another one? yeah don't worry
A	well I don't mind like at home you get like one day on your own which is fine
B	oh but there's always stuff to do at home
A	mm yeah
B	mm
B	yeah
A	and then I can point out to you the erm the ski test area
B	you've got bread in your hair
A	oh have I?
B	there we go
A	thank you
B	mm
A	if anyone is happy to do that with me otherwise I'll just do the half come back up on the gondola and all go down together I imagine
B	oh I see
A	won't they? they sit and have a drink and a talk you through today's events and who's crashed into who who has fallen off the lift yes
B	yeah
A	yes
B	those lifts seem to be a liability that's the biggest problem
A	oh that's what
B	well I can't believe he gave the I forgot to tell
A	yes
B	oh yeah if it was just straightforward it would be boring
A	oh yeah no that is funny
B	it's the ski racks the skis falling over
A	oh god that was hilarious that was the funniest thing I've ever seen and it was the sound as well as they all just clattered down like a whole row of skis just went
B	was it?
A	well normally they are but they weren't I tell you up at that gondola top gondola station it is just chaos and there's and there's people abandoning their skis on the floor because there's just too many people and not enough storage and no there weren't
B	oh okay
A	no he still had them in his hand it was like he it was like he it was like he'd just taken his out
B	oh he
A	it was funny
B	oh dear
A	yeah
A	but no all of that all of that is good fun
B	mm
A	some of it is just hard work
B	yeah
A	even the lady I was talking to she said oh she said you forget don't you how uncomfortable these boots are and she said I've got my own sure I said yeah I get
B	oh
A	well that's like me I don't like going fast
B	I used to love it though I used to love all that and ice skating a bit faster and
A	yeah but you've got old now
B	I know and I've got I just think I'd hurt my back and even when I was on those skis with
A	oh
B	that's not good
A	but you know the gentle ones
B	it's a long time since I put my back out where I can't walk where I can't move it is a long time since I've done that because I am very careful well I don't I don't do anything anything apart from walk I don't do anything that is going to irritate it in the slightest and something like that straightaway you are getting back into that area and I bet if I did it
A	yeah yeah
B	I'd put my back out and I would be absolutely in agony that's what I'm worried about
[ANNOTATION]	The person has hurt their back before and has been careful to avoid repetaing that.	Entailment
A	yes
B	which is a shame but I know the weaknesses are there because I've seen the X rays and the MRI scans and I've seen my discs that have worn away and I've seen the
A	mm mm
B	so unless I you'd have to do a lot of core strengthening and stuff go back to pilates do that type of thing again which I could have a go at but I know if
A	yeah
B	well that's like
A	yeah but at least you've got the TV to watch is something
B	well yes you have well he's got
A	what skis?
B	no
[ANNOTATION]	That the person has exercised in the past but has stopped.	Entailment
A	oh your back
B	my back and I was at home and I'd just got and they all thought it was funny at work because oh that's convenient that I can watch the tennis
A	oh I see oh and just watch
B	I'm thinking of having the garden because erm
[ANNOTATION]	That the person wants to fix up their garden but can't because of concerns about their back.	Entailment
A	oh when
B	when
A	gosh and he likes to chat
B	oh have I done no I've done it no I've done it since then he came to visit me that's right I didn't want anybody visiting he turned up
A	why did he come?
B	to see how I was he'd seen something somewhere or he had met
A	oh
B	or come to check on the garden I can't even remember
A	oh no
B	so it was after the garden was the last time I did it but
A	mm
B	no why are her poles up here? why is she tense? why is she ploughing?
A	yes that's pretty much it
B	mm
A	yes yes yes yes yes
B	well your sad little pair of skis will be on their own in that shop now waiting for you to come and pick them up
A	no they won't they'll all have been joined because lots of people will have finished for the day and put them back
[ANNOTATION]	That she is nervous about what's happening in the garden.	Entailment
B	right
[ANNOTATION]	That the garden has grown out of control.	Entailment
A	stink in that boot room
B	mm
A	it really does smell
A	horrible
B	mm
A	well if
B	yeah
A	is this her?
[ANNOTATION]	That there is a pleasant smell coming from the woman.	Contradiction
B	yeah I can't see behind but I am saying yes no but I mean
