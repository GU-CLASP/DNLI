B	at some point
A	okay
B	with Ian
A	who's Ian?
B	the guy in the first film who tried to kill
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Ian only appeared in the second film.	Contradiction

B	no
C	no
A	oh
C	he just really wants to become rich and famous
A	oh oh but he tempts them away doesn't he?
[ANNOTATION]	This film was in cinemas last July.	Neutral
B	he was rich and
A	and they kind of like they can do whatever they like they've got no rules
C	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Ian was rich because he invented coffee sleves.	Neutral
A	yes okay I have seen that one I don't think I've seen the other two
C	and there's loads of
A	mm
C	and Ian says there's only one rule
A	mm?
C	there are no rules
C	and I could think of lots of loopholes through that rule one have fun
A	but they realise that Dave only has their best interests at heart I'm assuming? and they miss him
B	erm I can't remember
A	well
C	yeah but we're going to get it on DVD well hopefully we can
[ANNOTATION]	C is not interested in buying the movie in DVD.	Contradiction
A	well I might treat you guys to seeing it
C	I'd probably prefer to see it on DVD
A	no it's nice to go to the cinema but they'll probably have on the cinema in the cinema they will have other films that will be cheaper cos they'll have a special half-term ones so if we want to go see something from that we might do that but I might as a special treat take you guys to the cinema for the chipmunks film but is there anything else that we so we're doing swimming we're probably we're going to see
C	what about
A	and there's the well he's working there's the pancake race erm at the village hall which we've never been to actually
C	so what's the race?
[ANNOTATION]	There is a race to help cure chipmunk cancer.	Neutral
A	so it's similar to the school you know when you do the pancake toss at school?
C	mm
A	so I don't know if this is with the actual pancakes or with a beanbag or whatever but you have to run across the car park obviously the cars are not doing anything
B	yeah
A	with with a frying pan and you have to to oh it must be a pancake a real pancake and you have to toss the pancake all the time
B	oh mum I've heard something about
A	sorry sorry you were on holiday?
B	in no in
A	in where?
A	what's that?
B	I don't know it's a country in England
A	it's a
B	England
A	no this is England this is the country in but in
A	I've never there isn't a place that exists like that
B	no it was no it was a long long long long long long time ago
A	oh oh okay
B	and not that long ago a woman erm was making pancakes when she heard the church bell not wanting to
B	and not wanting to be late she ran with the pancake and had her apron and that's why in
B	and erm
A	I love that
B	reach it first
A	yeah
B	before you win
A	so that must be in a village or a town
B	yeah
A	so did you learn that at school?
B	mm
A	that's a cool story so is that why we all do pancake?
B	and also
A	mm
B	there's another thing
A	crikey that's a bit sad isn't it?
B	yeah and harsh so they'll have to run away on pancake day won't they?
A	what if they did that one year but the next year they were successful is that okay? or do they only get one chance?
B	they only get one chance
A	oh
B	so then the the next daughter then the next one after that
C	so they could so they'd have to move to a different town?
A	I don't think they would make them move to a different town
C	no they would have to move to get married
B	no they won't they're going to say mum I'm not I'm gonna get married
A	maybe they would try and get married still
C	yeah
A	erm I think
C	if you have a giant mouth then catch the pancake in your mouth
A	so don't be massively late up with
C	neither am I
A	I hope it's not going to go on too long
C	cos then we'll still be awake?
A	because I'd like to be in my pyjamas lying on the sofa right now
