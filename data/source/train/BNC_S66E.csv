A	I was meant to have a session with
B	how long is your EPQ going to be? like your essay
A	apparently it's only like five thousand words which is like I could write that in a day
B	really?
A	like a whole day right if if I dedicated a whole day to it five thousand words is like
B	I I struggle with like writing like coursework and stuff like that
A	yeah
B	I can't do it
A	but that would be like fluff that would be like
B	mate what is er your title?
A	er erm so it's now What Should Humanity Do About Poverty in the West
B	mm
A	but I think the EU thing is really interesting and that relates to when we're going to Montenegro so
B	why did you choose the Balkans?
A	erm
B	yeah
A	then
B	oh yeah yeah I still I still have I have them I still have them I need to give them back
A	yeah I mean
B	yeah yeah yeah you can have them they're yours anyway
A	yeah cos erm
B	it was Turkey
A	it was Turkey okay but it's cool in erm in history now we're doing
B	your what do you mean you're only doing it?
A	erm we were all assigned a country
B	yeah
A	and then we had to research its change from eighteen fifteen to nineteen fifteen to the outbreak of war
B	uhu
A	and obviously how that contributed so you know stuff like
B	er Kaiser
A	Kaisers and then
A	ah
B	my grandma does that it's disgusting
A	yeah? what in in the house?
B	yeah yeah
A	no that's like like grandma okay but when you hear like thirty year olds who have like that's what I think
B	I seriously don't get this mentality about like if
A	yeah is he?
B	yeah
B	nothing nothing really matters so we should all be so we should be hedonists
A	does he
B	so if nothing matters the only thing you should pursue is pleasure
A	I think
B	and he thinks that it's good to pursue things which are
A	just short term
B	ultimately yeah self destructive
A	right
B	he thinks it's equal to pursue things which aren't
B	and it's just like yeah I know exactly like if you're gonna say yolo like you only live once
A	yeah
B	your point is if you only live once then make sure it's
A	then you should make it more precious right?
B	yeah
A	not
B	not like try and make yourself die at fucking forty
B	oh there's
A	where?
B	in there Starbucks
A	oh right oh
B	I don't know I don't get him
B	I think he's like
A	yeah
B	like even though like
A	no way fucking
B	yeah
A	ah
B	oh it's
A	yeah okay
B	yeah
A	and like you like you not that you'd want it immediately but like the thought that you could just die from or you could
B	cos the thing is then it could advance in later stages and then you're left with like stage four cancer
A	yeah you don't know about it and you're like shit
B	cos I I did lung cancer for my er issue report last year
A	yeah yeah
B	and like it it's you're so fucked basically that's what it is
B	if if you get lung cancer you're so fucked
A	really?
B	yeah
A	I thought I did I did childhood leukaemia and the like survival rates now are like ninety percent
B	yeah yeah that's the thing like oh if all all for things like leukaemia they're really high
A	yeah
B	but for things like lung cancer it erm
A	yeah
B	is really er really high er death rate because it's really high hard to notice
A	yeah
B	so because it develops in different cells than normal
A	yeah
B	yeah yeah also yeah and also it's really hard to get shit out of your lungs cos
A	oh right
B	you know you need to breathe air but you also need to like extract everything
A	yeah
B	and make sure you don't do do enough damage while you're extracting stuff
A	right
B	like you can burn skin off like to take cancer cells off and stuff
A	right
B	if you burn your lungs and they're damaged you can't really breathe properly
A	yeah of course
B	but yeah
A	feel so precious
B	feel like I'm interviewing you
B	mm
A	so I've like wiped everything but like for two days it it was last weekend the two days where I was cleaning it
B	yeah
A	it was just like ah like
B	it's horrible
A	I checked whether that does anything bad and it's fine
B	I I went to the airport on Saturday
B	er no no
A	oh yeah?
B	cos she's she's like ninety she lives by herself and she's ninety
A	yeah
B	and like
A	uhu
B	so my gran er so my gran er my uncle's taking her back here
A	so
B	no just for like cos like she might need more help because and the medical care is much better here
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	so like he was there and like while we were there erm
A	yeah
B	and
A	yeah
B	which is you know er yeah okay that's a bit unusual cos they usually go
A	right yeah yeah yeah yeah
B	but like the first er the first good rah is in Pakistan
A	yeah
B	so I was like it's not that odd
A	yeah
B	cos they do go
A	yeah
B	but then erm
A	yeah
B	by by
A	uhu
B	and me went like snuck up next to him
B	and erm he was speaking really loudly as well he was like
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	but basically
A	yeah
B	they're like
A	yeah
B	and so they've gone they've gone to these people are going like members of the Sikh community from the UK
A	yeah
B	or India I don't know where they're from
A	right
B	Pakistan Punjab
A	I see
B	to to try and
A	escape
B	not escape but like help relations like
A	oh I see
B	see if they can do anything
A	so what he was being er they were going because of cos of that do you think?
B	yeah yeah they said he said they were
A	oh right okay
B	that's why he was going
A	did you see the guy on TV who were
B	yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	and that's like I obviously haven't heard of it before like
B	yeah
A	like is that a
B	yeah apparently people are like dying a lot
A	really?
B	I don't know what I don't really know what's happening
A	yeah
B	I should know but I don't know
A	right so many so much stuff like
B	yeah
A	cos I hate people that they talk about
B	yeah that's why
A	right right I see
B	but like
A	you do know a lot about
B	I don't
A	just have their opinion out there I know
B	like some people
A	like no one we're gonna reference
B	no one we're gonna reference
A	there is puke on the floor
B	I know I just noticed
A	I I wasn't saying that to you
B	oh
A	I was just clarifying
B	just clarifying
A	we were just like er
B	we we said er so many times
B	ah
A	but yeah he does that he just
B	yeah yeah
A	they just have to have their
B	yeah
A	but today he
B	I was just it's so weird how like
A	uhu
B	just talks like every lesson and then it's hardly like anyone else other than
A	see like the whole
B	yeah yeah
A	like no but no he he's like way better than
B	he he says interesting things
A	yeah I know now like I I respect much more of what he says
B	yeah
A	than
B	yeah
A	year twelve I think
B	he's actually had like a visible change like even when he was in year twelve it was it was still interesting but sometimes it was less
A	yeah
B	it was just a bit like
A	shouting random
B	and like yeah kind of like I don't know and also like less
A	irrelevant
B	yeah less relevant and less
A	yeah
B	so invested in the topic more like doing mental gymnastics
A	right
B	I don't know
A	do you think it's like?
B	erm
A	I did this I did this as part of my erm
B	yeah I
A	yeah I know
B	because people we haven't even got to where we are just by following what we need
A	exactly
B	yeah and stuff like stuff that isn't always related or sometimes you know does
A	yeah
B	like I don't know about cloning cloning I don't know
A	yeah
B	maybe
A	yeah
B	but
A	yeah
B	they don't have any direct like application to medicine but indirectly it had has helped so much
A	yeah I guess that is useful in erm
B	but also stuff like finding out like things with different developmental diseases like
A	yeah
B	I don't know
A	it's science science is knowing
B	I mean like technically
A	shall we do it?
B	yeah
A	I mean yeah
B	so we we could technically but it's so people can deem it so unethical that we don't but should it be? I mean like
A	why do you think it is unethical?
B	I don't know I don't
A	what wait what what would be the point? just to see what happens?
B	I guess kind of
B	I mean that's just something
A	right right oh I see right
B	but like it doesn't really have any direct benefit
A	right yeah yeah
B	you could do loads of random shit
A	yeah I know
B	but we don't
A	yeah
B	mm
A	I don't think you can hate on someone for that
B	there's a
A	right
B	because the difference in price is not necessarily the difference in quality
A	yeah
B	and like that's so fucking ironic
A	isn't he the most sort of like
B	yeah he loves brands so much
A	yeah I know like
B	and the
A	he's not obsessive about it but he always talks about like yeah
B	the thing he he's like such he's very materialistic cos
A	yeah
B	he was like
A	I see
B	like if I couldn't go out to get
A	yeah
B	I just find that so strange that he's like
A	yeah I know
B	er heading for like materialistic hedonist nihilist
A	so yeah
B	I can understand I I can understand the nihilism kind of
A	yeah
B	kind of yeah you should but if you're not er usually if you're nihilistic you replace the set of values that you would get from religion from another set of values
A	mm
B	rather than becoming just hedonistic
A	or just hate society and choose
B	conformity
B	there was this book on the psychology of either the Joker or Batman
A	yeah
B	one of them
A	there's there's a oh what's it called? there's like a really famous erm
B	mm
A	yeah really famous stuff erm and that's his life and like he's like consulted on

B	what the fuck?
A	I need to look up which one it was one of his mythological
B	he
A	right
B	all myths are inherently the same cos they contain the same er features and then he can outline all the features that they contain into one story
A	right okay
