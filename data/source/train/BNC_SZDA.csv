E	and I said has
D	no if you could put me on it and I'd have said
E	yeah
A	erm
B	okay?
C	thank you
B	cheers mates
A	I think
D	is the salt there
C	yes
A	mm no I think the Kennel Club are all for prestigious
C	I don't know even that
A	prestige and erm
E	money-making
A	money-making rather than the welfare of dogs
B	yeah true
E	yeah very much so
D	yeah
E	so much so even though I love my Alice to bits it would have cost me something like twenty-five pound
A	mm
E	to change the ownership
A	mm
B	uhu
E	from
B	uhu
A	yeah
E	who we bought her from
B	uhu
E	to my name
A	so does she still belong to
E	she does
A	you have to pay to register them with a pedigree name don't you?
E	yeah
A	and I don't think they do the breeding much good as well they sort of
E	well this Kennel Club is supposed to be a great big oh the be all and end all of dog breeding
A	mm
E	and
A	yeah yeah
B	yeah
D	that was
A	so I don't actually
D	I've always thought that
A	approve of Crufts
E	I do think
C	had it on Jeremy Vine the other day
E	all their thorough breeding
C	about Crufts
A	did they?
E	like these dogs being killed
A	mm
E	prestigious dog shows
A	mm
E	and I mean we went to when we went we went to the German Shepherds didn't we
A	mm
E	the dogs were not nice looking were they
D	no
A	no I heard now where did I hear this was the a few years ago
B	mm
D	yeah
A	film and somebody was
B	mm
A	what would happen in the
A	that extreme a hundred puppies from one dog but
B	mm
A	so they
D	uhu
E	why?
A	cos of the value it will lower the value and it will make you know
B	mm
A	if there's too many
C	who said that?
A	some someone from the Kennel Club
C	no in where did you hear that?
A	erm
A	I don't know cos it was
E	oh
A	remember
C	what is the Kennel Club? do you have to
A	but it was a case of you know
C	be in it?
A	if these dogs become
A	too common
D	in a way putting dogs in
A	if these dogs become
E	mm
A	too common then their value drops
E	oh yeah
A	mm
E	and he's
A	mm
E	pound
A	mm
E	and I mean Alice was five hundred and fifty pound
A	mm
E	erm
C	get me a tissue then

C	we were talking about Beagles
E	we saw one today
B	mm
E	didn't we?
B	mm
A	well I saw one on the way back from getting the eggs
B	did you?
A	and I thought
C	I like Beagles I think they're really cute
A	I like Beagles but they're none of you don't see many er
D	they're not very good pets
A	a popular breed at the moment
D	no
A	are they? why are they not a good pet?
D	cos they're not very
A	my friend
B	aren't they?
D	no
A	used to have a Beagle
D	they're very boisterous
E	they're a bit
D	destructive
E	they're naughty aren't they?
A	oh
E	my neighbours
A	outside they're gun dogs really aren't they?
B	are they?
A	aren't they? Beagles
B	I dunno
E	mm
A	mm
D	they're hunting dogs aren't they?
A	mm

A	yeah they're
E	they're
B	oh right
E	you know when

D	mm
B	mm
A	mm
C	these roast potatoes are really good
B	oh
C	these roast potatoes are really good
A	mm they are they're lovely
B	it's cos cos
A	so nice I'm gonna have another one
C	they might even rival yours mum
A	mm?
C	they might even rival yours
A	well
A	and that's hard cos that's about my only culinary success
C	yeah yours are the best in the family
E	yeah you do do a nice roast potato
A	mm yeah
A	well I think these actually equal them
C	they do actually
E	I peeled them did I tell you?
E	which I think is part of the experience
A	mm the secret behind a good roast potato it's all in the peeling
E	mm
C	yeah I've heard that
B	mm
B	very appealing
E	very appealing
C	so what made you
D	cos we knew
D	we was under pressure of you
B	you were there
C	no
D	cos
B	it's hard
C	you probably could have
C	probably daren't
B	but in reality I think it was probably cos I couldn't find the erm
E	recipe
B	the crumble
C	so you couldn't find crumble
A	so you bought the Yorkshire pudding
C	four Yorkshire puddings?
A	oh cos you knew you'd have to make the crumble
B	I'd have to make both so I thought
C	oh okay
B	oh hang on I'd rather make the crumble than the Yorkshire puddings
C	yeah okay
D	so you
C	and she made them for you
D	yeah and she sent them over
C	she's very kind
E	she's a nice woman
A	she's a cracker
C	I love Aunt Bessie she's the best
A	when it comes to aunts they don't come much better than Aunt Bessie
C	well she's the only aunt I'll ever have
A	yeah you'll
C	no
E	you've got aunt
C	yeah but I mean a you know like a proper auntie
A	a blood aunt
D	a normal one
C	a sane aunt
A	and your kids
B	that's true
C	no they won't
E	has he not got any brothers and sisters then?
C	he's got a sister but no no brothers
C	I haven't
E	and where do they live?
C	she actually lives in Switzerland with her husband and three kids
E	oh right
C	no in
B	uhu
A	mm
C	have you been to there?
D	no in
C	oh okay
D	and he used to have a business out there
C	yeah
D	really expensive to live out there
A	mm
C	mm
A	her husband's a banker
C	yeah they they're not short of money
A	mm
D	and er
C	he makes his own flour
D	cos he was moving back to England
A	mm
B	yeah
D	well when you come out there
A	oh
D	they don't let you take much back
A	mm
B	mm
A	mm
D	and somewhere along the lines this bloke got erm
A	mm
D	to pay back what basically
B	oh
C	oh there's no gravy left
A	mm
C	no he's from
A	oh
C	it's only about five kilometres from the German border
B	is it?
B	what Switzerland?
A	no
C	the the town in Switzerland
B	oh
C	it'll be Switzerland one kilometre less than one kilometre away from the German border you idiot it's for a
B	oh I thought you meant from
C	oh no the German border
B	oh right right
D	this half half of Germany speaks German don't it and the other half
A	mm
D	is French
C	yeah they live in a German speaking part of Switzerland
D	cos I went to
C	oh I don't know that
D	and that was German speaking there
C	yeah
D	become fluent German
C	but apparently it's very very very different they say they said that even a lot of Germans find it hard to understand Swiss Germans it's like it's almost
A	really?
C	mm
A	so it's a good job you didn't get chosen by the British Council to go to Switzerland then
C	I wouldn't have minded
A	yeah but you would have learnt
C	yeah I probably would have learnt learned words and phrases that
A	you would have learnt the wrong German
B	does anyone er want any more gravy?
A	mm
B	mm?
C	I would actually thank you
E	how old is she?
A	oh she younger than
C	about thirty-two thirty-three
A	older then
E	and how old's he?
C	he's twenty-eight
A	and she had one one daughter first the first daughter
C	she's three she's just three now
A	she's three and how old what was she when
B	pardon?
C	well the twins are eighteen months so she must have been very young when she got pregnant again
A	so she had one daughter and then she got pregnant
C	with twins
A	quite quickly and she had twins so she had three kids under two
E	oh
A	can you imagine?
E	no
A	at that at that point in their lives
D	oh
A	I think I'd kill myself
A	mm mm I can imagine how old was
C	six wasn't he?
A	not no just nearly six I was born in June he would have been six in the August so he was yeah nearly six
D	when that meat's rested it's quite tender isn't it?
E	why wasn't it at first then?
B	it was in for about forty minutes for er no forty-five minutes so it should have been in for half an hour
A	mm why was it in for forty-five minutes?
B	because it said it should be in for two and a half hours
A	why do they say that on recipes?
B	I don't know I don't know
E	because they make it so it is like hard as old
B	mm
C	boots
E	boots
A	cos we've just decided with beef now you know just put it in for half an hour and let it
B	mm I put it in for three quarters
A	mm
B	you know we kept testing it didn't we
D	mm
B	yeah
E	but I do quite
B	we should have just taken it out the first time and let it sort of
A	yeah cos that's
B	cook cook outside
A	slightly that's very slightly
B	yeah it is
A	that's a bit overdone isn't it?
B	yeah too overdone for me
A	yeah
B	yeah yeah
E	I like it where it's pink
A	yeah
B	mm
A	and soft
C	and blood oozing out that's what I like
E	not a lot of blood
A	mm
E	I don't mind a little bit
B	but I think you can do it sort of really rare and then people who want it stick it in a microwave for ten
E	they yeah or
A	mm
B	ten minutes you know?
E	or they have a bit of the the other end of it
B	mm yeah the other end
A	mm
B	yeah no it was too much for me
E	what about that meat you got from the
A	not er it was a good one
E	that erm that was a lovely one
C	dad shall I finish off
A	but that wasn't enough
B	yeah I know I know cos it
C	dad shall I finish off the
B	no it's alright
A	these roast potatoes are
B	I'll do it in ten minutes' love
E	it's all in the peeling though isn't it?
A	the roast potatoes yeah
E	yeah it's the peeling
B	what's appealing?
C	trust you that's
B	yeah well
E	what? why what are you doing?
D	I think that's your
A	she'll know that
D	no she
A	hide it then hide it hide her whole plate
E	where?
A	erm
D	is she left handed or right handed?
A	well she's left handed when she eats she's right handed everything else
E	coming back
A	okay she's right handed but when she eats with a left hand with knife and fork for some bizarre so does
C	what?
A	both of you
B	mm
C	can you give me my food back?
C	where's my food?
C	you've swapped plates idiots
E	I'm captain
A	both of you are right you and
C	well maybe you taught us
A	I didn't
C	wrong
A	I certainly did not why would I teach you the wrong way when I eat the right way?
E	what's the right and what's the wrong though?
A	well
C	yeah why is it wrong?
A	right handed people hold their knife in their right hand
B	oh
A	and their fork in their left
B	would you like gravy
A	but watch her
A	when she eats
E	well I'm sure you're no what's comfortable
A	well I used to get very cross cos the dinner lady at
C	oh she was such a
A	at primary
C	she we saw her the other day in
A	did you? did she recognise you?
C	no
A	oh
C	well she might have done but we didn't look at her really
A	she used to get really erm
C	she was nearly like
E	cross
A	she was kind of off she used to make her
E	yeah but then that's etiquette and what should be and what should be
A	seriously? you know on the grand scale of things does it matter?
E	are you left or right
B	mm
E	are you right handed?
A	mm
B	normal
E	yeah I am
B	mm
A	but in every other way she's right handed she writes with her right hand she does everything with the right hand and I I it really doesn't bother me that she eats with her knife and fork in opposite hands and I don't think in the great scale of the
C	well it's never been
B	well exactly yeah yeah
C	a problem apart from with the dinner lady
A	mm
C	I've never come across
B	does
C	any other issues
B	ah how sweet
A	so there must be a genetic
C	oh so it's sweet when
A	we must have passed on some kind of genetic fault to our children
C	grandma says she would have been left handed when she was younger
A	yeah yeah she used to get her hand slapped didn't she?
C	mm
A	er then I used to think about
C	they were older than me
A	well yeah but they weren't that much older and I'm saying she wasn't an old woman she was sort of my kind of age why was it so important to her that by that time and in in the world things had moved on from it being you being a devil's child because you were left handed
C	yeah it was a strange thing to focus on
E	but I do find
A	mm
E	people that write left handed are very
B	oh yeah
E	they look very cack
B	yeah they look ridiculous
E	they look very cack handed
A	oh really awkward
B	yeah
E	erm and it doesn't
B	mm
A	have you ever seen her
B	yeah
A	when have you seen her writing?
B	well obviously I have cos I think she looks hilarious
C	so funny
E	because they're a bit their hand looks
A	yeah they write
E	a bit spasmodic
B	mm yeah
E	and a little bit like they're
B	mm yeah spastics
E	yeah
B	mm mm
E	it well yeah
B	well yeah it does yeah
E	and they don't and the the paper doesn't flow
A	but
E	yeah it's very illegible I mean
A	yeah
E	we've got a doctor
A	and
E	who works at
C	yeah doctors are always bad though aren't they?
E	and you can't read their writing anyway and
A	mm
E	you put left handed in the equation
A	mm
E	and forget it
B	mm mm
A	but
A	the whole time she's writing
E	but I do find they're because it doesn't flow
A	mm
E	like with a right handed person
B	mm
E	they're like sort of writing backwards
A	yeah they're
E	on on their self
A	they need to in order for it to flow properly they would need to write from the right to the left of the page
B	mm
A	wouldn't they?
E	but saying that my friend
B	mm
E	erm left handed and she's got a left handed chequebook
B	has she?
A	oh you can
B	mm
A	mm you can and you can get left handed scissors and things
B	mm
A	can't you?
E	yeah
B	why?
E	so it adapts
A	mm
E	because they write like that
A	mm
B	mm
E	they're they can smudge what they're writing like we write like this
A	mm
B	uhu
E	going from
B	to the right
E	left to right because they
D	like that
E	because they go from right to left they can smudge what they've written so they could be writing and it goes along and smudges what their signature or the words
D	what?
E	that they're writing yeah there's chequebooks
D	oh
B	mm
A	and
A	so what does her chequebook look like? cos I've never seen one I know you can get them
B	well it's
E	it's the other way round
B	yeah it's all covered in smudges
A	so the the pages are that side
A	mm
E	or so and so the sum of
B	mm
E	blah blah and the box is there it's the other way round with the
B	oh the box is
A	mm
B	on the left hand side
E	the space in the
B	yeah
E	yeah
A	I've never seen a left handed chequebook
E	and you have to order it specially
A	mm
B	let's order one
E	I've decided I'm gonna be left handed
A	mm
E	the shape of my chequebook?
A	I'm finding it really difficult to get a chequebook at the moment
B	mm
E	well didn't I have one come through the other week and I was thinking where's my new chequebook? where's my new chequebook?
A	mm
E	phoned up the bank and they went well we issued it to you blah blah blah blah blah and I went oh okay she went oh well we'll cancel that and we'll send you another one and then
D	mm
E	and it's gone round the down the back of the dresser and caught on the drawer
D	you put
A	mm
D	if you put too much stuff in the drawers
B	mm
A	mm
D	what happens it pushes it like that
C	mm
D	and it pushes it over
A	that's what happens in our kitchen I've found letters
D	mm
A	amongst the casserole dishes
C	yeah
A	erm
E	that was very nice
C	that was lovely
A	but I
B	we should be
A	I started having my my bank account was erm hacked into online
E	was it?
A	mm
D	yes you told us didn't you?
A	I didn't
D	oh
A	well I had terrible trouble and it was just and
C	mm
A	I'd never but you know the bank were writing to me to saying we need your signature to authorise this
E	and where was it being hacked from?
A	oh god knows cos they don't know they can never trace it
E	right
A	can they?
B	no
A	anyway I went into the erm I went into the bank and I says don't she was very she was very nice wasn't she? really
B	mm mm
A	helpful that woman took all these letters in and I said look this is you know this is what I'm being bombarded with constantly you know and I know you're monitoring the account but it's I'm just really really uneasy that people have got access so in the end it was decided I'd just close
E	how did they know where you live?
A	oh god
E	oh right oh
A	mm
E	like
A	saying you know you've been setting up this standing order but we need but we now need
E	was that not the best way to go about it though if somebody's hacked into your account?
A	mm I think so
E	cancel it and then start again
E	so I got a new account a new number a new everything which has been fine I haven't had any trouble since but
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	I've I've kind of not got round the
B	mm
A	and I went to see
C	you might find them all in the
B	what's your pin number?
C	letters
E	and we'll look into it for you
[ANNOTATION]	E got hacked because they posted a picture of their credit card online.	Neutral
C	well obviously if
D	yeah
C	they're not gonna say yes or send you one and not send you one
A	cos I really need to use
C	they'll just they didn't they're not gonna send you one
A	cheques but it's just a bit of a nuisance like you know for instance that Butlins money for
D	and then you
A	and it's just a little bit of a nuisance
B	mm
A	do you know what I mean?
B	uhu
C	mm
A	so I really must and I and I notice online you used to be able to you know go onto your online account
C	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	They have never been able to check their account online.	Contradiction
A	one of the requests order a chequebook but they haven't got that option any more
C	have they not?
A	no
E	I think that they will get rid of cheques eventually
[ANNOTATION]	Checkes are going to disappear at some point.	Entailment
A	but
E	some do
A	but there are times when
E	yeah
A	you know a kid for a birthday present or whatever you know or you're paying a friend and
E	and I must erm
A	mm for something
E	one of the
[ANNOTATION]	You can ask to get a chequebook online.	Contradiction
A	that you owe
E	our neighbour her husband had his funeral and he'd put all his money to the Ark which is an animal welfare
B	oh right
E	place
A	uhu
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	The funeral was an open casket, which was surprising.	Neutral
E	and er I was thinking what's this cheque for two three four when I'm on cheque like three hundred and whatever? and it was ages and ages
C	oh
D	it's finished
A	oh
C	I'm only on fifteen percent
A	well I find online banking really useful
