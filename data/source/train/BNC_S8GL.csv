B	see I go starter main
A	yeah?
B	yeah
A	but when we did this meal last week for
B	dessert yeah
A	yeah
A	yeah
A	while if I eat it I'll actually probably be physically sick cos I can't eat that much
B	yeah
A	mm
B	starter's not always big and heavy is it and then
A	no
B	you can eat all your main and then think
A	no
B	oh that's it I don't like pudding anyway
A	mm
B	nice cup of coffee
B	I'd do a cheeseboard
A	yeah oh yeah

B	yes
A	and he loves Camembert that's one of his favourites
A	yeah
B	cheese slices which are
A	yeah
B	cheese slices like there's nothing in them
A	no it's it's a really distinctive taste isn't it?
B	mm
A	my nephew he really likes all the different cheeses

B	mm
A	me sister she eats lots of raw peppers but she only likes double Gloucester

A	yeah
B	they'll eat it but if it's got white and fruit and it
A	do they like try new stuff? or
B	yeah
A	they know what they like and they like to eat that
B	they know what they like yeah
A	you know?
B	see
A	yeah
B	like a sausage casserole
A	mm
B	mushrooms
A	yeah
B	when I do one I have to sort of do a different pot for him then get the hot pot out for me and
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	but
B	and then it I'll do a couple of Yorkshires with it for
A	yeah
B	with it
A	that's like
B	do you know what I mean?
A	deconstructed?
A	so it's the heart of fashion isn't it you've had a cuisine
B	so yeah so I'll say oh I'll do a sausage casserole for tea and then
A	mm
B	I always have to do
A	yeah
B	cos he don't like all the onion the gravy and
A	yeah
B	but he loves gravy
A	yeah
B	you see he can
A	mm
B	pour the gravy onto the Yorkshire
A	I've got a friend that doesn't like onion
B	if it's not like
A	and she and she says the onion
B	yeah that's it's that's what he says and he always says it makes the gravy taste weird
A	mm
B	but
A	no
B	cos he won't eat sprint onion or anything like that
A	no
B	if we go to a takeaway
A	mm
B	but no onion
A	yeah
B	cos it comes and one bit sliced he won't touch it
A	yeah
B	the whole thing's
A	well it's
B	yeah it's strong especially when it's raw isn't it?
A	mm
B	it
A	mm
B	yeah
A	I I
B	yeah
A	but I don't like too much of it
B	mm
A	whereas
B	yeah I'm a bit like that
A	yeah
B	raw onion is er
A	it's funny isn't it taste things? and they reckon taste changes
B	oh wow
A	over your whole body
B	yeah
A	the smell and
B	they do I know I know about
A	mm
B	my brother's just suddenly been diagnosed with peanut allergy
A	yeah
B	but he's forty
A	mm
B	forty-three
A	yeah
B	cos he's never had
A	no
B	that's
A	mm
B	type two so he just takes the tablet

B	yeah
A	mm
B	but that didn't come out until
A	no
B	you know a few years back
A	yeah
B	and you think well
A	yeah
B	and then suddenly
A	yeah
B	at his age like where's that come from? yeah
A	yeah they do
B	strange innit?
A	it's it is strange and peanut's quite a serious one
B	yeah
A	cos it
B	yeah
A	it mind you mind you if you're allergic to peanuts it doesn't mean you're allergic to other nuts
B	that's right yeah
A	if you're allergic to other nuts it doesn't mean you're allergic to
B	yeah
A	peanuts cos they're different
B	mm
A	or the
B	it's terrible for him cos now being
A	all the diagnoses as well yeah
A	no
B	do you know what I mean he's
A	yeah
B	terrible to go shopping with cos he's
A	and the
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	cos he
A	with not having sugar in?
B	yeah cos he had his heart attack as well
A	yeah
B	he just he's completely
A	yeah
B	all over the place
A	yeah
B	and I said to him like
A	that's a shame
B	cos my mum went and got him
A	mm
A	yeah
B	and I said to him remember he's type two
A	yeah can't have anything
B	take the injection that's what he's thinking
A	yeah so
B	I said
A	yeah
B	so
A	it's really just researching it and guessing and really going through it with him isn't it?
B	mm
A	yeah
B	I said to him oh we need need something
A	mm
B	sit and read and
A	yeah that's it
B	so that's what she did she went and got him one so
A	yeah
B	yeah not really but
A	does he? no because it it's it's a necessity?
A	mm
B	because he knows it's a necessity
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	cos he's not a big eater
A	yeah
B	cheese and I said
A	yeah
B	me
A	yeah
B	and I'm like what's he doing?
A	yeah
B	I can't you know?
A	is he is he testing? has he
B	er
A	or not?
B	oh I don't think so no
A	no
B	I just
A	mm
B	blood tests and that
A	mm
B	I know his feet
A	he ought to ask just
B	and have
A	if he can see a dietician
B	drops put in his mouth
A	he ought to go to his doctor's and just say
B	mm
A	can I see a dietician? and
B	mm
A	who could go and
B	yeah cos he's getting a bit confused with
A	mm
B	type one I think
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Someone needs to see a dietician.	Entailment
B	which
A	yeah
B	you know they
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	but naturally
[ANNOTATION]	Type 1 Diabetes is harder to manage than Type 2 diabetes.	Neutral
B	I think it's
A	it's it's worried him made him realise
B	mm yeah
A	yeah
B	cos when he went back to work
A	mm
B	an outside job a lady wanted her fascias doing
A	mm
B	cos when he had his heart attack he was up a ladder
A	oh right
B	painting
[ANNOTATION]	It was dangerous for him to have his heart attack while working on a ladder.	Entailment
A	goodness
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	and just asked my dad if he could
A	yeah
B	got there
[ANNOTATION]	His dad had a heart attack.	Entailment
A	yeah
B	and just froze
A	yeah
B	couldn't do it
B	so me dad
A	mm
B	he got round he done it
A	yeah
B	he's alright now
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	His dad's heart attack was caused by him working so hard.	Neutral
B	but it just shows you when he got there he was like
A	mm
B	lady was out
A	yeah
B	he was looking at
A	oh yeah
[ANNOTATION]	The lady who hired his dad was not home when he got there.	Entailment
B	he got erm
A	okay
B	they put a
A	a stent in?
B	a stent in yeah
A	yeah
B	and then they found out he was
A	mm
B	a little bit overweight but
A	yeah
B	then they found out he was diabetic and all that so they sorta triggered it all together
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	The overweight person weighted 125 kilos.	Neutral
B	and that's
A	so he's had a a scare really
B	yeah
A	an almighty scare and just
B	yeah gonna say he's only he's only eighteen months older than me forty-three forty-four in February he'll be
A	yeah
B	so he's still young ain't he?
A	yeah
B	so he's got a little boy
A	mm
B	so you know? but yeah it scared him
[ANNOTATION]	The diabetic guy has a girl child.	Contradiction
A	and when did he have it how long ago?
B	er it was only
A	really?
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	The parent is not too old.	Entailment
A	oh so it's all still quite new then? it's
B	yeah
A	mm
B	to do the outside jobs and that that he gets so it was probably April May
A	mm
B	so it's not been that long
A	mm
B	but er
A	oh so it's it's quite new like I say so really
B	yeah
A	see just go and see people that he needs to see
B	cos I said to him
[ANNOTATION]	The diabetic parent is responsible for exterior jobs.	Entailment
A	mm
A	but if he's if he's
B	well he's got a thing
A	well
B	saturated fats
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	The diabetic parent likes fruits.	Contradiction
B	he's
A	yeah
B	I said
A	mm
B	he's just completely
[ANNOTATION]	The parent hates saturated fats.	Contradiction
A	so is he is on his own?
B	yeah he is
A	yeah
B	yeah he is
A	and
B	he does yeah
A	yeah
B	mm
A	and that's the
B	mm
A	and yeah
B	erm and he cos
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	He is alone.	Entailment
B	I
A	yeah
B	I could never see him eating something like that before but
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	They are talking about a man who is not with someone.	Entailment
B	he done he he had peppers and everything in it and the chicken and
A	yeah
B	and I sorta thought
A	so he's eating right it's not as if he's not eating
B	yeah
A	to
A	think of it as him being healthy rather than him being paranoid about the diabetes
B	mm
[ANNOTATION]	A thinks he's overly suspecious about having diabetes.	Contradiction
A	yeah
B	he'll go to me mum's and mum'll say oh do you like a sandwich and that
A	mm
B	and all this I've got eggs and now you don't have to have bacon or cheese
A	no
B	you can have an egg
A	scrambled egg or something yeah
B	scrambled egg on toast or he'll
A	oh he's gonna be
B	mm mm
B	you know but?
A	yeah
B	he's sorta still a little bit
A	you might find in six months to a year he'll relax a bit and
B	mm
A	and actually then start to allow some things in
[ANNOTATION]	He will probably be less strict in some time.	Entailment
B	yeah
A	but it
unknown_female	it stops
A	he's looked at his own mortality hasn't he?
[ANNOTATION]	He never eats peppers but he eats chicken.	Contradiction
B	he did yeah cos he used to smoke as well and he's packed that up
A	yeah
A	that's
A	cos he wanted to talk to you about that didn't he?
B	well he does
[ANNOTATION]	He doesn't smoke anymore.	Entailment
A	mm
B	he goes you ain't smoking in my house nor my garden he goes
A	no
A	so what is it with the smoking with you is it do you want to give up or do you not do you enjoy it and you just?
B	I I enjoy it really
A	yeah?
B	yeah it's just a bad habit innit?
A	yeah
B	smoking since I was what fifteen?
A	yeah
B	see my mum and dad used to smoke they packed up when I was what?
A	yeah
B	they stopped so
A	mm
B	they've been stopped a good few years yeah
A	mm
B	and
A	mm
B	now he can't stand it
A	no
B	he started off having one of them fake
A	electric
B	ones
A	ones
B	yeah and then
A	yeah nicotine
B	the normal ones
A	yeah
B	and he
A	yeah
B	so
A	yeah
B	his dues he's done it
A	that's it
A	but you've gotta want to do it haven't you that's the thing it's
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	I'm not ready
A	no
B	but if he never had a scare I don't think he would've stopped
A	no
B	cos he always enjoyed it
A	yeah
B	do you know what I mean I think the heart attack and that's
A	mm
B	that's what made him stop the scare so
A	yeah
B	if that didn't happen
A	you don't wanna wait till you have a heart attack or something you'll
B	no
A	oh I might stop now then
B	yeah that's funny innit?
A	well you might find with this
B	mm
A	you've got your own business get yourself going with that and say
B	mm
A	do you wanna have all the stress and hassle that you had working for the company
B	that's right yeah
A	and you might find that actually that would settle
B	during the days like when I'm
A	no
B	it's when I get in the car have a quick fag on the way to the next house
A	yeah
B	so I end up I mean I'll have
A	no that isn't too bad actually
B	it's when we get home on the evening or teatime
A	do you smoke in the house?
A	right you ought to start saying now you're gonna smoke outside not in the conservatory
B	mm
A	and be really strict with that
B	mm
A	do you think yeah
B	in your local pub innit gotta go outside?
B	so yeah no I sit in the conservatory
A	yeah
B	that
A	it's
A	but
B	mm
A	but you might find it'll
B	mm
A	no
B	you know what I mean?
A	that's fair enough
B	get
A	yeah
B	little
A	is he still? having problems at school?
B	he
A	yeah
B	good days and then he just goes silly again
A	mm
B	our English teacher rang me last week
A	mm
B	cos he weren't doing like she asked in his lesson and he's like well I don't really care and
A	yeah
B	and I said to him well you do care
A	you need to get your English
B	and the teacher said well he can do it she said it's just stupid it's like took him ten minutes to get a book out
A	that's probably more frustrating
B	cos he's doing
A	yeah
B	that's more controlling the classroom
A	yeah
B	or the bunch of kids
A	yeah
B	than
A	yeah
B	no and I thought
A	so she needs to just work a way of saying
B	mm
A	get your thing out do this do this
B	now
A	yeah
B	or leave the room
A	yeah
B	cos
A	yeah
B	I don't think she's got her own bloody child if you ask me
B	cos a lot of em up there are in only in their early twenties
A	yeah
B	just qualified and straight in
A	yeah straight in and actually
B	they sorta look like they'd be better off with
A	yeah
B	where they know they're gonna be naughty
A	yeah
B	do you know what I mean?
A	yeah
B	instead of like
A	yeah
B	yap yap yap yap
A	yeah cos it
B	mm
A	when actually you've gotta have some life experience to actually be able to manage the teenagers haven't you?
B	yeah
A	mm
B	can you work with kids though?
A	yeah that's the thing that's it
B	cos they don't actually do that in their training do they?
A	no
B	go to school they're just chucked in
A	yeah
B	off you go
A	yeah
B	and they're like woah

A	yeah
B	she'd go he'll won't do that with me
