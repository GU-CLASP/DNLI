C	oh
D	lid
B	yeah the lid like it's vacuum sealed on so you have to ping it off I think I don't really know I did the vacuum sealing bit and then I assumed it would all come off as one bit but I had to sort of

C	er I dunno quite what I've done with the
B	I have no idea
B	first time I got these jars I don't really know how they work
C	mm
B	no tempted to make mead for
C	mm
B	for Christmas
B	that was that was nowhere near as successful
C	oh
B	it is kind of undrinkable for people
C	oh
D	for people
B	it is highly advised not to
C	did the dog see it?
D	the dog said
B	it's not ideal
A	definitely wouldn't do that
B	it's cos I tried to rush it I tried to do it too quickly and it I think it's gonna need another couple of months so I I tried it out and it's just it's just not finished it's pretty horrible really
C	oh
B	I still I still bottled some up and brought it down anyway but
B	with er with the warning do not drink this
B	mm
C	oh
B	hopefully by the time
C	yeah
B	the batch should be okay
B	I'm just amazed that you didn't
C	mm
A	I was drunk
B	and somehow allegedly didn't see anything I I
A	you genuinely saw nothing
B	so hard to believe
C	however for like months cos
B	mm
A	erm but then I was so I was also convinced that actually he wasn't
B	mm
A	just gonna pretend that that's the correct answer
C	then you
A	it was like a double bluff yeah
C	yeah
B	but you also guessed that it was gonna be tasty alcohol
A	yeah that's true
B	that we'd be able to drink together no
B	completely wrong
A	mm
C	no
A	mm
C	yeah
A	yeah
B	had Naked Wine before we've given them once
A	mm probably
C	do you get it too?
A	no I used to when I was in Brighton
C	oh my god mm
D	shit tons
C	good point
A	erm
D	shit tons
B	I think that's the right measurement
C	mm
B	of red wine for me
A	erm but d'you know I've noticed recently I don't know if you guys have? I have been on the quest for organic wine
C	all organic things it seems have gone like
A	not all of them like
C	yeah
A	although there's definitely been a dip because like in my local Asda for example I used to be able to get organic olive oil and organic sunflower oil and now you can only get organic sunflower oil
D	mm
C	mm
A	but you used to be able to get quite a few organic things there now you can't really get anything
C	mm
A	but now not even in Co-op which is you know one of the most ethical of the lot
C	mm see I haven't looked for ages
unknown_female	mm
C	because we've got been getting this box stuff
A	oh right
D	oh yeah cos that
A	I've been asking as well
C	but
D	it used to be like the mega easy way of choosing which wine to get because you wouldn't have to really bother looking at the leaflet
C	yeah just
A	cos there'd be like one or two
A	exactly be like one or two
C	mm
A	organic ones and you're like oh there we go we'll just go for these like whatever
C	that's a point cos they did used to have a really nice one Spar oddly enough
A	really?
C	and it was really well priced
A	mm
C	like about six quid or something
A	mm
C	and it had ducks on and it had all the story about how the ducks eat the slugs and stuff
A	mm
C	erm
A	mm
C	but it was really nice wine too but they don't
A	used to get that in one
C	they don't sell that here any more
A	mm
C	but I noticed they sell at the art centre now in the art centre cafe but it's probably about twelve quid there
A	but then the Co-op used to do a nice cos they still do their Fairtrade ones but they
C	mm
A	used to do like an organic Argentinian Malbec I think
C	yeah
A	erm
C	yeah
A	they don't do any more
C	mm
A	shocking
C	mm
A	mm
C	which was really quite nice and
A	mm
C	quite cheap and good and stuff but they stopped stocking that now here anyway
A	d'you reckon like people thought in the recession people aren't gonna want organic stuff so we just won't?
D	mm
A	well that was my theory
D	dunno
C	well it does seem to have coincided like quite well
A	mm
C	so
A	mm
B	what was that wine that we had in
B	one with like no sulphites or anything in it
A	oh my god
B	just happened to taste absolutely awful
A	it was also organic
C	it was? oh
B	it was just the worst thing
A	it had like quite a lot of I don't think sediment is the word I think sediment is another thing
B	like
A	it was more like solid floating masses in there a bit like
unknown_female	er
D	like a bit of pond scum in the wine
A	yeah pond pond scum wine that is a great description
A	mm
A	that's what they should've called it miraculously
D	be interesting to see how that would sell
D	pond scum wine
B	yeah
C	think that's true mm
A	it might work quite well like when you're kind of forced to go round someone's house for dinner and you don't really want to
C	yeah
A	we could
C	I brought you some wine
B	yeah
B	think we drank it all though didn't we?
C	mm
B	think we
C	anyway
B	we made our way through
unknown_female	right
B	yeah
A	mm
C	mm have you tried the chutney? I think it's nice
B	I'm not entirely sure how it goes with this but
C	I was quite enjoying it but
B	I just
B	I just quite like sweet things so
B	well sweet appley things
D	see I'm normally quite an anti-sweet kind of
B	I'm not into like chocolate or like
D	taste person
B	I dunno sweet chocolatey type things but apple pies and things
C	mm
B	I get behind those
D	mm yeah
A	didn't you used to have a big thing for ketchup though
A	not?
C	he'll eat it whereas I won't touch it
A	oh
A	oh yeah
C	that's the only thing
A	mm
C	doesn't go wild over it we don't have any all at all
D	yeah I don't mind like I'd
A	mm mm mm
B	no it's not
A	I have like
A	I have like tomato ketchup emergencies if I run out of tomato ketchup like if I make a fish finger sandwich for example
B	that's not as bad as the barbecue that we had though
A	mm
B	we had a barbecue and there was no ketchup
A	no ketchup
B	like the condiments were all just missing
C	oh
B	and it was er
C	that is like the
B	and we we had had like this enormous thing and it was just
C	yeah
B	gone and none of us had noticed
C	oh no
B	oh well we've got all these burgers no ketchup what?
D	shocking that is a little bit of a disaster
C	mm
B	it was kind of a disaster yeah it
B	god
C	you
B	thing is
C	can get away without ketchup if you've got like plenty of other stuff instead though
B	there was there was not a lot of other
C	mm that is the thing
B	well it was an impromptu one it was a very impromptu barbecue
C	oh
B	it was one of the ones that sort of comes together about like quarter to ten at a pub in summer and you go oh shall we have a barbecue now
B	oh yes
D	mm
B	so really they couldn't complain too much I guess
C	yeah
A	mm
unknown_female	mm
C	I'm boiling is anyone else boiling shall I turn the heating down?
A	I'm definitely not boiling
D	I'm just right
C	okay
B	yeah all good thank you
C	I have got long johns on cos I was outside this morning singing and it was freezing so
C	I'll just take my jumper off
B	I have skiing socks on and just the most enormously warm slippers
C	ah yeah they look awesome
A	I need to get my slippers involved in a bit
B	I think that was pretty much the first thing I did when I got here
A	mm
B	and slippers good yeah
C	yeah you need them downstairs there's a cold marble floor
A	mm
C	which is nice in summer not so much in the winter
A	how long did it take to lay that?
D	er dunno really
A	I'm sure I was on the phone to you and
D	I've sort of forgotten
A	at one point and you were like we're just laying down the marble
A	and I was like marble?
D	I remember now you were like
A	mm
unknown_female	mm mm
C	oh yep ha
A	where did you get them?
A	Ebay
A	the fountain of all good things
D	I found them they were kinda like seconds that have little chips in the corners and stuff like that
C	mm
A	oh nice
C	it ended up being the cheapest flooring option out of all the things we were considering that were possible really as well
B	getting marble?
C	yeah
B	there's
D	they're really thick slabs as well
B	well we wouldn't put cheap stuff
C	yeah they're so heavy like there's a tiny bit left in the kitchen for putting pans on stuff just feeling that like it's pretty bloody heavy
A	really heavy
C	yeah
A	oh well your house ain't gonna go down
C	I could barely lift one like
B	mm
C	so are you
B	so are you
A	I know but
C	oh
B	I'm only a little bit
C	but you had a tiny portion
A	mm
B	ah that's what it is
D	I'm a little bit slower
A	mm
C	yeah
C	mm
A	mm
B	that's what it is
unknown_female	mm
B	I take regular breaks for red wine
A	mm
A	I'm liking a little orange tang on the edge
C	mm mm orange tastes like orange
B	I'm
C	don't worry there won't be any bacon
C	at all
B	it has been a very rich sort of weekend
C	mm
A	it has
B	no it is Christmas so you're meant to have rich food at Christmas but
C	yeah
A	meaty meaty time
[ANNOTATION]	they are not sure about Christmas food	Neutral
B	only for
C	I have made some really rich truffles
unknown_female	mm
B	nice
unknown_female	mm mm mm
D	so what was the conclusion with the wine thing should you pour it? is it
D	better? cos don't know whether you and
A	mm
C	about area and doing all this crap
A	mm
A	mm
D	so what was the conclusion?
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about wine	Entailment
A	I mean it does alter the taste
C	what's your honest conclusion now he's not here?
A	erm
D	I'll
A	I mean it does alter the taste a little bit
C	mm
A	but it's not always like it depends on how you like your wine basically
D	so it
A	it
A	erm they like
A	they would they would have it
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about weather	Contradiction
D	right so like what the manufacturers want you to taste is open aired
A	well you can't think if you're having nice wine coming off small estates you're not thinking any more about what a
[ANNOTATION]	they are not sure wine is good or not	Neutral
D	yeah
A	like you don't worry about whether you're airing it or not
C	mm
A	cos what they want you to have is just drunkenness
D	yeah
A	and then more Jacob's Creek wine I presume
A	but like
C	mm mm
A	and they can't do that for you like the wine is you know for whatever reason it necessitates being in this particular bottle shape or whatever
D	yeah
B	so what so if that's the case why why are the bottles like that?
B	why d'you not have like a big like screw top of it yeah so it can like?
[ANNOTATION]	person B is talking about Creek wine	Entailment
C	it should have with a big neck yeah
A	mm mm mm
B	since then having to decant it into a thing
C	though maybe the metal would be oh cos but screw tops
B	or just giant corks
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about weather	Contradiction
A	mm
unknown_female	yeah
B	just really big corks
C	giant bung things
D	the the cork's like the vulnerable thing isn't it? that's like the thing
A	mm
B	I suppose that's the bit yeah that
D	so the smaller that is the better in a way
A	mm
C	mm
D	but then there's the whole thing about selecting the cork for certain permeability and all that and like getting all that sort of finely honed so that it
C	yeah is that a real one this time? yay
A	mm
C	the bath itself is not very exciting old scummy you know
A	there's
B	oh right
C	bathroom is
B	just have a shower
C	we never use it
B	yeah when was the last time?
C	you could have a bath though if you wanted to
C	at
B	yeah we didn't have one in two years
D	just feels weird having baths in other peoples' baths though
C	maybe three years ago
A	mm
C	maybe four
D	it's not is it not
C	that is
D	just just is weird in general
C	they they're worried about their boiler not working so
A	mm
B	oh yeah one of those
C	they've just got into this new house and stuff but it's just like it's not that appealing
B	no
A	mm
C	but in any case it's just a bit sort of weird
B	having a shower seems fine like it's like yeah
C	yeah
B	I can have a shower it's just fine but a bath's just
C	it's a bit more of a project as well isn't it? and it uses lots of water and you probably wanna
B	yeah
C	once you've got it like you've gotta be
B	it is yeah
A	mm
D	yeah
C	though if they're not there it's not so weird
A	but also
C	but then that's also a bit weird too
A	like when you're round somebody's house
B	yeah it's weird though you're thinking it's not weird because it was weird but since they're not there it
C	it
B	yeah
C	it's
B	definitely
A	also like just being around somebody else's house even though you've been asked to look after like I would always be suspicious that other neighbours would be thinking there's a burglar in
B	there's a burglar in taking a really long bath
D	er
A	well
A	I don't think he was taking a bath especially if it's in the middle of the room
C	yeah but I mean if they're that observant neighbours
C	they would recognise our van or they would recognise us because
A	mm
C	we're round there quite a bit
A	mm
D	either way it'd be pretty hilarious if the police arrived and you were just lying in the bath
C	yeah just
B	yeah you
D	hello
A	yes officer were you here for a dip?
A	the water's just fine
D	well like
C	oh yeah
D	and
A	oh yeah?
D	it's just kind of like got a fire underneath it
C	they've got their fire underneath it
A	mm
C	and they're out in the sticks and you can see the stars and stuff really well from there
D	that is quite cool actually
C	but it's still a bit like well we'll have to like go from the house and
unknown_female	er
C	go out and have a bath and come back and
A	you see that's but that's
unknown_female	well okay
D	that's more of a like
C	no that's okay but
D	no like a look like it's not like you're going to get clean it's just like
C	no
A	mm
D	going for this experience so it's a bit better really
A	mm
C	mm
A	but also that's very much like I could get down with that because I like that's very similar to like what you do in an onsen in Japan
C	mm
A	so you would go out there butt naked but that is perfectly socially acceptable
C	yeah
A	and the way to do it culturally in Japan
C	yeah
D	and like hot tubs are just baths with bubbles aren't they?
A	mm
C	mm
D	be more than happy to go in those
A	yeah but that's normally their swimming costume and stuff though isn't it?
D	gets weird really quickly I would imagine
D	and the sort of tepid water outdoors it
A	they're normally like you'd be in a erm like a swimsuit for that wouldn't you?
D	usually yeah
A	yeah whereas like an outdoor bath thing I would go in naked
unknown_female	not if your mates are there to be
A	well no but in Japan you do
D	depends
C	I wouldn't mind if I would
C	but like they wouldn't be watching us anyway would they?
unknown_female	I hope not
C	that would be quite weird if they were
D	they'd be standing at the side with a towel
D	waiting
C	like neither of us really like getting pruny and that seems to happen like within two minutes of being in a bath
A	maybe you need to build yourselves up
A	maybe you need to start some training in your bath
C	training
D	before we go
C	I'd much prefer sitting in a sauna nice and dry and hot
D	two baths a day
C	mm
A	I prefer a steam room to a sauna
C	jump in cold
unknown_female	mm
C	oh no
A	I do
C	the air's all like muggy and dirty and weird and like you feel clogged up and like can't sweat properly
A	see in a sauna I find it a bit too dry
C	no it's good
B	I don't really like either
A	no
B	I think I've been put off both of them just by my gym and just going in and it's just full of big hairy sweaty dudes and
C	then it just
B	that's just not how I like spending my
C	no
B	whatever time it is so
C	that's a bit weird I've never been into one like at a gym or something that'd be weird
B	no that's the only one only time I have like access to them
C	yeah
A	you should see some of those spas
C	no there's a great one at dance camp like
A	mm
C	just like mainly nice and then you just run out into the cold showers run back in cold showers mm ah
B	I do quite like that actually
A	it is
C	mm
A	like I've been to some like there was a festival I went to the
C	mm
A	that was quite cool but erm
C	no
A	yeah
D	why cos it's
C	why?
D	limited visibility?
A	yeah
D	yeah I can see that
A	it's very much just like
C	but it's dark in there
C	but it's dark in saunas
D	limited visibility is possible
C	it's not like it's not like really light in a sauna it's quite dark
C	yeah
A	it's not like close
D	glaring
A	it's as least as light as this in most saunas
C	no
A	yeah
C	no not in the one that I like going in
A	oh well
C	but in any case even if it was light like I mean it doesn't matter
D	no it just depends who you're sharing the sauna with
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	I mean if it was weird gym guys
D	it's just weird
C	very weird
unknown_female	mm
C	obviously but you wouldn't go in there
A	no also it's not it's not just yourself it's more like the people who are like in there as well who are like looking at you
D	it's just a weird dynamic in general
C	no that's what I mean weird gym guys
B	especially the old ones
C	but like in in a kind of like
unknown_female	yeah
A	depends
B	yeah depends
D	I think one of the best hot tubs I ever went in was the muddiest as well
C	but you can also cooch up and stuff so they can barely see you if you're worried about your bits
B	cooch up
C	you can
C	cooch up cooch up
D	cooch up
C	cooch up cooch up like
C	you know you can sit like this can't you? like with your
A	yeah that's really natural and enjoyable
B	you look look really like relaxed there
D	make you feel a lot more comfortable
A	just sit cross like this
A	yeah I suppose not really
C	so and then
A	mm
B	and just chuckling every now
B	at
B	and like there must've been about fifty odd people in there
C	must've really dirty and stuff
B	and it was just like it was so well you finished and you're just covered from head to toe in like just mud and just horrible horrible stuff
B	and it was just one of the greatest ones ever cos everyone was just so relieved to be out of the cold and out of the mud into this
B	sort of floating around there
C	cool
D	so it was warm
B	yeah yeah it was warm hot
C	festering poo
B	they they were like they were blowing like some bubbles in it
A	smell
B	but they were
C	your grubbiness was probably killing the bubbles wasn't it?
B	yeah
A	I thought you were gonna say they were powered by farts rather than like
B	there would've been an element of that
B	a lot of people eating a lot of protein and carbohydrates to get through the race
B	suddenly relaxing
B	er
D	nice
A	er
C	er
C	oh er
B	it was good though
C	mm
B	it was very relaxing
C	well
B	horse poo
C	it's
B	would be the best of poos
C	yeah
A	to be in a bath with yeah
B	yeah
A	I'd wanna be in with them
C	yeah
D	if you have to choose any poo
A	I think of all poos
A	yeah definitely like yeah a horse poo
C	sheep wouldn't be too bad I think
A	oh no no no no no no no no
D	depends
C	I mean
D	how solid it is I think
C	well same with the horse
D	yeah well horse poo
A	no I think
C	mm
B	the solidity of it
D	rabbit poo?
A	no
B	I mean
D	yeah
B	but you'd have the problem if you went for a dunk they're quite small so
D	mm
B	you could get one in your nose or something
C	they could get caught in your hair
B	yeah
A	oh
D	they'd probably dissolve quicker as well being little pellets
C	everything gets in my hair
B	yeah
D	more surface area
C	poo solution
A	wow anyone gonna go for a little more rice on this note?
C	yeah does anyone want any more? erm
A	I'm gonna have just a little a little dapple of rice
C	more veg? fruit?
A	I'm good I'm good on the oh it was lovely very nice felt very healthy and cleansing
C	fruit truffles
A	mm
A	actually I think a little later I'm gonna have a bit of rice and then a little later I'm up for like
C	wine truffles
A	wine and truffles and all that kinda stuff
C	okay cool

A	yeah
A	yeah I know who was it who said that no like chocolate and cheese don't go?
C	mm no not sure either
A	they were wrong
D	that seems a bit
B	but I think you'd ruin both of them
C	mm that isn't the best combo
B	like
C	mm
A	mm
C	like chocolate and mascarpone's okay but
B	like cheese and chutney?
C	chocolate and cheddar mm
A	mascarpone?

B	but these really are
C	pretty good
B	they
C	we were just saying like
B	kinda taste like
C	yeah we were just saying mm the sprouts were okay because you didn't have to avoid them on the
B	yeah
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B really enjoys sprouts.	Contradiction
C	so it was quite good
C	yeah
D	they become
C	mm
D	fairly disgusting
B	well that's what
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker C believes it was very nice	Entailment
C	we overdone them at Christmas Day like
D	well
C	did we overdo them? maybe
D	they were edible but
C	mm
D	but they weren't
C	but only like a gravy and hidden yeah
D	yeah you need lots of gravy
C	but I didn't at least I didn't do loads of them so that we didn't have to have loads of yucky sprout leftovers
D	yeah
B	the only time I cook them myself is if you sort of chop them up really finely and sauté them with like onion and garlic
[ANNOTATION]	The recipe also includes beef meat.	Neutral
C	yeah
B	and then they're really nice
D	yeah
C	sprout curry is okay
B	no
D	mm again I think like that would just overdo her a bit
A	mm
D	I think they're okay in curry if you put them in towards the end and you chop them up quite finely
C	mm mm mm
D	and they're just kind of hidden and you think it's like hidden healthiness
B	I like hidden healthiness hidden healthiness works
C	yeah
B	like kale I really do not like kale but it's really good for you
[ANNOTATION]	Kale is speaker's B favourite vegetable.	Contradiction
C	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker C also likes kale.	Neutral
B	but you get the healthiness anyway
C	new smoothie recipe
A	mm
B	mm
C	very nice
A	mm
C	kiwi cucumber kale
A	mm mm
[ANNOTATION]	The smoothie recipe includes kiwi, spinach and banana.	Contradiction
C	and orange or apple juice
B	oh yeah? really?
A	mm
C	and it yeah
B	nice
A	mm
C	very healthy
B	I love smoothies yeah I just find like it's just the easiest way to get lots of greens really easily and tastily
D	I'm pretty suspicious of smoothies
B	if you're in a rush
D	I have to say
A	suspicious of smoothies?
D	yeah
C	too sweet too sweet
D	I just like chewing things if it
A	mm
D	doesn't like I dunno it always seems like food I dunno
B	I like smoothies for like the opposite reason cos you don't have to chew them
D	smoothies just like weird somehow
B	so I will have all of my vegetables for today in these next three gulps
D	it freaks me out drinking food
C	mm
D	it's like odd
C	it is a bit weird it's a bit like baby food
A	mm
D	yeah
A	there is something weird about like you know
C	as long as I have water afterwards cos it burns my teeth
A	cos
C	well
B	yeah
C	I see it as like you know you've done the chewing in the blender
B	mm
C	there's a bit of saliva missing
A	mm
C	but it's okay for me to eat
A	no I know but don't
C	but not too
A	isn't there like a reaction in your body where like when you chew like which is why you
A	but like if you don't chew like the mechanical action of chewing sets off enzymes and stuff in your stomach and that doesn't it?
C	er well I
B	to an extent but I think just getting food in your belly just does the same thing anyway
C	like
D	yeah I don't think it does I
C	well maybe it's best to have a smoothie when you're also eating food
A	mm
C	and therefore it shouldn't be viewed as like replacement food it's just a drink
A	mm
D	a slightly lumpy smoothie that you have to chew
C	but I often make those cos I get bored of blending and it's so loud that you have to chew my smoothies anyway like
B	yeah yeah you're right
D	well the last one I had was
B	if you have frozen stuff in it as well that doesn't quite
C	yeah
B	go through
C	yeah
B	my friend's been on erm this thing called Soylent I don't know if you've heard about it? it
D	it's very
C	Soylent?
B	named after Soylent Green yeah
D	it's not that you poo the bed every night
B	erm
A	mm?
B	yeah he's been pooping a lot erm no it's just like a food replacement thing sort of like er sort of like a Weight Watchers type shake except
C	oh right like smoothies all this shit?
B	but it's like fully nutritionally balanced
C	right
B	so you could live just off this thing instead
C	just on that? ah how soulless
B	erm there've been people doing I know but like for a lot of people people don't like cooking and they don't like the effort
C	yeah
B	or they just don't do it so they just end up having
C	crap
C	like yeah
B	and all of the rest of his meals are milkshakes and he's been on that for about three months and apparently the first couple of weeks were a little bit weird and his body was adjusting to
C	mm
B	like like going from eating actual food to just having liquid all the time
D	ah go on
B	and now he just feels like better than ever like he's just
C	mm
B	energised he does loads of exercise and
C	mm
B	apparently there's a lot of people saying this as well and I don't
C	mm
B	think it would be for me but I think
C	yeah I can see the attraction for people like
B	but it's probably quite good if you're in a bit of a rush like just to get in a healthy meal
C	yeah
C	I can see how
B	healthy
C	some if people are like that and they don't like cooking and they don't particularly like eating like mother
A	mm
C	like if mother was on her own
A	mm
C	she would totally need that otherwise she just would like not eat anything at all
A	mm yeah
C	erm
B	mm
C	like
B	apparently it's not the tastiest thing
C	er
C	oh no that's even worse though if they can't even make
B	it's a bit sort of chalky and
C	er
A	er
C	er
unknown_female	mm
A	no
C	no no no no nope
A	no
C	I just know that's not for me but
B	but
C	I'd like to think healthy yeah
A	yeah
B	mm like it makes lots of
C	yeah fair enough for that kind of person
B	try and attempt to try it
D	bit suspicious of like someone coming up with like the ultimate nutrition thing in general really
C	yeah
D	or or like sort of being able to pre-empt everyone's kind of needs in a way
C	yeah because you can have a complete like range of all the nutrients and stuff but that might
B	well people are different but there's different sort of things for different people in different lifestyles but
C	mm
B	I'm not that suspicious it it's
A	but like on a day to day basis you do change like what you need like and like other days you just you know
B	yeah true but a lot of people just eat the same thing every day anyway or
A	that's true
C	mm
A	yeah
B	if you're if you're having not much anyway
D	yeah
C	yeah if you're like having rubbish anyway
B	I find it hard to believe if you're having like a proper healthy diet then it would be better than that or as good as that
C	no
B	I can't believe that but
C	yeah I mean chewing is kinda cool
C	I'm with you with the chewing
D	in
B	yeah
D	in general
C	yeah
D	just like quite nice
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	I'm not
B	cooking as well and like
C	yeah
B	creating something tasty
C	yeah
B	that's good
A	yeah
B	instead of just like a grey liquid
A	like that what we've just done I mean you
C	mm
B	well instead you might be like playing board games or you might be
A	well we can have that anyway I would imagine
B	er perhaps socialising or you might be but yeah you could get like an extra hour of it or something
C	yeah
D	it's true
B	which is which is his argument
C	yeah
B	which I don't agree with
A	yeah
B	but
C	mm
A	well
unknown_female	can you pass that water please?
B	but he is also
A	oh god
B	yeah right so
A	oh god oh he's been talking about that to me for ages like
B	yeah he's finally
A	last
B	yeah
A	where was he at
B	er he didn't come
C	drinking milkshakes?
B	yeah
C	doing all those things he can do now
B	oh yeah we had all the food but he doesn't eat food any more so it wasn't really for him
C	mm
A	d'you want some water
C	no thanks I'm good
D	that's it like
D	what do you do though if someone invites you in for dinner you're like?
B	well no he does still eat sometimes and he goes out
C	yeah
B	for meals and stuff it just
C	right
B	means that he's spending his money on like he'll go out for like a nice meal once a week instead or something
C	yeah
D	yeah
B	and doesn't spend any time cooking
C	well that's quite nice
B	which is
C	mm
A	saves on the washing up
B	it saves on the washing up as well
B	you could get rid of all like your plates and bowls and
C	yeah
C	and a
D	you could have another room
C	you could have an whole another room
C	yeah
B	the benefits are becoming apparent
C	mm
B	where's your kitchen? I don't have one but I do have my hot tub room
B	yeah
C	come and drink smoothies with me
C	oh
C	mm
D	interesting
C	mm
B	yeah I'm tempted to just I'm gonna check it out I think I don't I'd definitely not be doing it all the time but I definitely wanna see what it's about and
D	mm
B	you have like a busy week and don't have time you say
C	yeah
B	I'll just have this grey liquid and
D	mm
A	mm
C	yeah
D	tell me about grey
B	it's not like it's it's not it's not a good colour it doesn't look like a healthy colour
C	mm
D	yeah man grey
B	sort of beigey grey
C	oh
D	grey's just not a good colour for any food
B	no not really
A	see but you can see how like like
C	mm mm
A	like every single day but it's
C	mm
A	actually really healthy for me to make time to cook
C	mm
A	not that it has to be for everybody but I just think like for me I could very easily if there was something quick that I could use like that to not cook I could easily fall into that as like a bit of a trap
C	mm
C	yeah you just work or?
A	yeah exactly
C	bad
A	it's an important like break in my day to like
C	yeah
A	cook and eat and stuff
C	you see sometimes I'm just like at the office I'm like this is the only thing I've got to look forward to
A	yeah
C	that means I have to go okay then I can make dinner and have a break
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	and then I can do some more work after dinner so yeah
A	yeah

A	wow
B	wow
C	they come in their own little bags

C	because they're so weird
A	they are
C	erm
A	they are
D	you wear
A	it doesn't
C	yeah yeah
A	it doesn't help I don't think that the heel bit on them that's quite weird anyway is like metal and very heavy I think that's really not helping them to stay on
B	very
C	no
A	yes
C	they're size seven but they fit size six
A	oh yeah I most of my shoes now are size seven
C	oh right
A	yeah
B	this looks horribly complicated
A	it's it is
B	which is the obvious thing
C	oh boy
A	well it is for
B	oh my god
A	not really
B	this looks really really serious
C	oh
A	and that has got
A	like that is one of the best I've heard I haven't played it myself yet

C	it's quite unusual and there may be other oak on the scene doesn't look the same
A	erm
C	no
A	chestnut
C	no you're not even pointing to the bits though

B	name the trees
A	er there's no olive on here
B	er palm sycamore
C	no
B	great redwood
C	mm
A	mahogany
C	no
B	great redwood

B	it's a bush holly?
A	not from England I
D	you do
A	er rhododendron
C	no
A	er
B	sycamore
B	I think I've already said that
A	bloody hell
B	but
A	I've got nothing
D	perhaps you should just say
unknown_female	okay
C	teak that bit is teak
B	maple
A	oh teak on really oh
C	and then this bit is something else
A	well I've still got nothing
D	that bit you'll know
A	will I?
D	yeah well well I mean you won't know you might not know the wood
A	it's not from the pews is it? it's not from the pews
C	it's it's not you won't you won't particularly think about it as a wood but you might use the oil
D	it's quite smelly
A	camphor
D	no
C	erm doesn't well you you can grow it in this country
A	tea tree?
D	no
C	but you don't usually see it around
A	I've already guessed cedar er
C	that particular bit used to be a fence post
A	ah
C	but because it's so erm
D	durable
C	mm
A	no
D	er go on another clue
C	er menthol
A	eucalyptus
D	yay
A	ah
C	mm mm
A	holly
C	mm mm
A	white oak
C	mm mm
A	ash
C	mm mm
A	ash
C	mm mm
A	eucalyptus
C	yeah
A	oh god
A	er
C	well sort of but it's a different type isn't it?
B	oh come on
A	oh come on
B	that is hard
D	well just think about
B	white oak dark oak
A	dark oak
C	this is other oak
A	other oak
C	it's where this is yeah upcycled so it's
B	is that six types of trees?
A	it's lovely
C	and and the and these bits these bits are bicycle spokes
A	oh nice
A	nice
B	er what?
A	bicycle spokes
B	oh cool
A	awesome
C	so you have to decide whether you like it as it is or whether you want it oiled
A	oh yeah if I want it oiled
C	well
A	brilliant
D	it'll go
C	it
D	slightly darker and
C	yeah
D	more vivid
C	yeah
D	spilling water on that
C	yeah
D	that's what it'll kind of look like but it's on permanently
A	oh yeah
C	and but I mean if then you spill anything on it it'll be protected whereas
A	I'm totally gonna oil it yeah
D	why don't why don't you show show
C	oh yeah
D	that's not been oiled
C	that isn't oiled
A	oh okay yeah
C	and
unknown_female	oh oh oh
C	oh er
D	and you can kinda compare it to the door down the stairs which has been oiled
A	okay
D	cos that's oak
A	er okay
C	I mean different woods are involved
A	ah very nice yeah
C	and that's a eucalyptus as well
A	mm mm mm mm
C	so it's actually you know it's fine
A	mm
C	but like we thought these bits would come up quite nice as contrast-y
A	mm
A	yeah
C	but then this is really nice not oiled
A	well it's
C	mm
D	cos it it'll probably bring out the grain a bit more as well just like a thin coat of
A	yeah
D	the
A	I think oil
C	got one really warm foot now and one not very warm foot why?
