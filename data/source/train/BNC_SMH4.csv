A	so what did you just say?
C	cake
A	we're just trying to work out instructions for a cake
C	so so
A	like what kind of
C	it's set to zero and we need to get it onto the line that's bigger than the tiny lines but not the biggest line
B	okay
A	cos how much do we need?
B	we need
C	a hundred and fifty
B	so we need the big line in the middle which is pointing straight at four
A	now can I just make a suggestion? I tend to do dry ingredients first so I tend to do flour and sugar
C	okay
A	first because margarine is a bit messier
B	okay now
A	yeah?
B	how much do we need for those ingredients? let me see we need one five 0 so that's the same as
A	yeah
B	the lightly salted butter so it's caster sugar first
C	oh
[ANNOTATION]	The use unsalted butter for the recipe.	Contradiction
A	I would get cos it's an all-in-one mix so you're just
C	shall I do it
B	well
A	why don't you do it together?
[ANNOTATION]	They are going to mix the cake with a Kewnwood mixer.	Neutral
B	so erm
C	right I'll tell you when
B	okay just
A	what I would suggest you do
B	no
A	tell tell her if she's doing it like er you can see
A	how are you doing?
B	yeah
A	you're on it? well you've got a
B	look
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A doesn't have any suggestions to make.	Contradiction
A	it depends where you're looking
B	I were looking
A	this
B	there
A	you that that black long line needs to be
B	it's in the big black line
B	yeah
A	yes
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A is talking about a red line.	Contradiction
C	yeah?
A	is it a hundred and fifty?
B	okay
C	no
A	yes it is
C	I not
A	you're looking no you can't look at an angle you have to look at it from here can you see? because if you look at it over there it'll appear differently
C	cos
[ANNOTATION]	They're looking from a very big angle.	Neutral
A	she's not in your way
B	oh
A	you can just look behind her so is it a hundred and fifty?
C	no
A	hang on
C	yeah a little
A	right
C	oh a tiny bit less
A	a tiny bit less or more?
C	I think it's alright actually
B	okay so
C	it doesn't be it doesn't have to be bang on
B	now we
A	well no it does need to be pretty bang on actually
C	pretty much but not exactly
B	can you pass me that please?
A	I'm just gonna give you this big bowl
B	so you can pour these in here
A	so you can put all of the ingredients into that one good so what I also do
C	oh yeah
B	yeah
A	so
B	so we need one hundred and seventy-five grams and six O zee for self-raising flour
A	right so it's it's a hundred and seventy-five grams or six ounces so we're doing grams so you
B	I don't
A	done?
B	I don't know when it's been done
A	well let's have a look together
A	of the way
A	move out of the way right
C	I
A	hang on a moment right
B	the big so it's
A	this one not the two hundred the one
B	so
A	just before
B	okay
A	alright?
B	stop
A	stop
B	that's enough
A	ah why are you carrying on going?
C	sorry
A	when I said stop?
A	but really why have you carried on doing it? why are you shrugging you're your head? why did you carry on?
B	keep going
A	because a a big chunk just fell it when you said stop
B	mm
A	no but you still did it right so are are we still over two hundred?
C	yes
A	right are we getting
B	yeah we're we're
A	we're on a hundred and seventy-five?
B	yeah
A	yes that is pretty spot on good so can you
B	I'll pour it in
A	now can you just double check is it an all-in-one recipe where you can add everything at the same time?
B	erm
A	there isn't a particular
B	it's
A	order?
B	like yeah you need to do it and
A	in all at the same time? okay
B	no you can't you need to do it
A	no no er no it just says put all the cake ingredients in a bowl so that's fine it doesn't really matter what order
C	can I crack the eggs in then?
A	well hang on a moment
B	hang on we need to put the butter in
A	you need to put the butter in
C	put the butter in put the butter in
B	and then with the and then you can crack one egg I can crack another egg and then we can both crack one egg
A	or I could crack a third egg
B	cool mum
A	yeah
B	I I come on
A	I don't mind you do one first
B	so we need the same amount as the
C	caster sugar
A	yeah a hundred and fifty
B	so which is
A	so let's just
B	here
A	first of all we need to make sure
B	so
C	shall I put it in?
B	tell me when no I'll do it tell me when to stop
C	okay
A	when it reaches a hundred and fifty
C	this is gonna take a while
A	oh darling just get a big spoon
B	okay I'll
A	hang on
B	and I'll just
A	hang on
B	put this in the dishwasher there
A	there you are
B	oh
A	try not to slam the drawers
C	and another spoon and then the same spoon to get it off that one
A	sorry?
C	that is a very irritating piece of butter
A	well
C	butter
B	it's margarine
C	it's
A	or margarine
C	same thing
A	no let her do it just get a really big look let's have a look something like that where are we
C	a hundred and fifty
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B thinks butter and margarine are the same thing.	Contradiction
A	dead on?
C	dead on
A	a hundred and fifty? that's only a hundred there
C	what? four point is only a hundred
A	what?
C	oh
A	nought a hundred two hundred so you need a little bit more
C	I think that is now
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A thinks  margarine and butter are the same thing.	Contradiction
A	no it's not quite is it? can you see?
C	yeah
A	right that's the that's the the mark for a hundred and fifty
C	uhu
A	it's not there yet is it? it's really important
B	okay now
A	well do you think it's there now
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B prefers butter over margarine.	Neutral
C	erm no
A	right how about now?
C	yeah I think that's enough
B	okay get your eggs
A	right so you can add first of all add the margarine
B	mum please do I
A	you hang on leave all of the eggs
C	okay
A	or you end up cracking you know
B	if you
A	thousands of pieces of different shell
B	you
A	it's
B	can start mum then it
A	okay you want me to start?
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker C enjoys cracking eggs.	Neutral
A	right well I'm gonna crack do it straight in the bowl simply because I've got lots of experience and I've opened it and I know it's fine and there's not any bits of shell so that's my egg good
B	do you know what you do yours
B	hold the bowl for you
A	right listen
B	do just one big whack
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A has no experience in cracking eggs.	Contradiction
A	one bit whack there you go and then put your thumb in
C	put your big
A	break break it apart
C	ah
A	put it in the bowl? why are you not putting it in the bowl?
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker C is an expert at cracking eggs.	Contradiction
C	ah
A	you've done this loads of times there perfectly fine
C	not really
A	yes you have you've done
B	thank you
A	it's fine
B	there
A	that's got nothing to do with you not putting it in the bowl
B	there's a bit of shell in there
A	yeah a tiny bit of shell is fine cos we can take that out
A	you may need to get a little spoon to do that cos it tends to move when you put your finger in? have you noticed? and it doesn't stay there
C	oh I'll have a go it's a fun game
A	it's not a it's not a game there you can get it out with a spoon right so
C	well
A	done right pop the eggs in
C	I will
B	oh
C	you pop one in I'll pop the other one
C	yes you can mm there's one in already
C	that's the other one
C	no there was one that fell out
A	just do what you need to do
B	okay
A	now erm
B	okay it's
A	you have forgotten you have forgotten an ingredient
B	one teaspoon of vanilla extra I'll do that
A	extract no you need to use a particular teaspoon measurement which is this one so
C	oh yeah
A	right and make sure it obviously needs to be level because it's liquid
C	so you need to be here
A	so you need to put it hang your spoon over the bowl
B	I love vanilla
A	I love vanilla too now I'm gonna make you whisk it
A	by hand when I say not
B	oh can I do that first? can I
C	okay
B	do that first? I'll be
A	can you just double
A	check the recipe?
B	sorry put the margarine we put the baking powder
A	yes and what else?
B	we put the caster sugar in we put three eggs now I put the
C	so shall I start whisking now?
B	one
A	well just start whisking
B	teaspoon
A	gently
B	vanilla extra
A	extract
B	extract jinx
A	jinx double jinx triple jinx
B	no the person who jinxed you first
A	okay
A	what you could be doing
A	so could you please be putting twelve cupcake cases into the tray?
B	is there twelve on the tray?
A	can you count and tell me?
B	one two three four five six
C	yes there is twelve
B	yeah
C	I did it in fours
A	yeah fours or threes
C	or sixes
A	no cos they are in a row of four and a row of three
C	mm
A	so you would either say three six nine twelve or four eight twelve wouldn't you?
C	mm
A	yeah
B	I just counted three six one two three four
C	finding it a little hard
A	you're finding it hard?
C	a little hard
A	that's because
C	I've never whisked before?
A	well not for a long time but it's the the margarine
A	is pretty tough
C	yeah tough cookie
A	but you are doing very well so
B	then I'll have a go
A	and then you can have a go and what do you need to get rid of?
B	okay so we can have
A	right what do you need to get rid of in the batter?
B	we need to get rid of all the lumps
A	yeah
B	and make sure it's a nice smooth batter
A	yes
B	and make sure that it's not really hard
A	nice and smooth yeah
C	I'll hold the bowl in case
A	that is a really good idea
B	so it you need to get all the lumps out like these lumps we see here so make sure there's no lumps of butter or egg
C	why do you get lumps of egg?
B	well when you mix it
A	if you have
B	you mean like an egg yolk?
A	yeah well if you haven't mixed it you would get little lumps of it that's why we have to
A	mix egg when you scramble it don't you?
B	I've mixed I've made scrambled egg before
C	so have I
A	you've made
A	you're very good at that
C	oh that smells so nice
