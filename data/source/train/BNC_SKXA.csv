A	oh there's my cable
B	hello oh
A	minus two point five it's quite warm actually
B	how much do you hate your glasses steaming up?
B	yeah
A	my cheeks and my nose are warm but I can't see
B	yes steam up everything
A	or do I want to be so cold my face feels like it's gonna drop off but I can see through my glasses
B	oh the decisions we have to make yeah I'm really thinking about contact lenses
A	yeah definitely recommend them
B	I've never ever had them I've only had glasses for two years
A	oh
B	so
A	I had glasses well I've had them for nearly thirty years now but erm
B	ah
A	for my forties crisis a couple of three years ago
B	yeah I want to be able to see
A	and I want to swim and yeah I wanna be able to see all the colourful pretty little fishes and things erm so I got them and I started with monthlies and it took a long time to get used to them but I did and then I found I couldn't really cope with the waste with fluid and keep buying fluid
B	mm hm
A	and then it goes off and then you go abroad and then you need to buy some more and blah blah blah
B	mm
A	erm which cost about a pound a day which is a lot cos I've got a stigmatism thing
B	mm hm
A	but I might only wear three one month sometimes
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	another month I might wear twenty erm
B	mm hm
A	and for skiing the other week just goggles on see perfectly brilliant
B	yeah
A	I wondered
B	and I can't really see what I'm doing
A	I do wonder if you were faced first a little bit more because you didn't have any glasses on
A	yeah
B	oh funny
A	er
A	yeah I think it's
B	oh goodness me
A	oh
B	I know that's what I was saying before
A	yeah
B	mm
A	she's got cool hair hasn't she
B	this woman she is getting in this car so that'll give us a little bit more room
A	oh okay
A	yeah so do you think erm what are your thoughts feelings or whatever on erm heading to this spa place at
B	yeah I really would like to go but I don't really want to go for the whole week
A	uh huh
B	yeah
A	cos I've got erm
B	mm hm
A	so could potentially go
B	yeah
A	and come back Tuesday
B	yeah
A	what do you think?
B	that's fine yeah and I'll move my personal trainer to Wednesday instead of Monday
A	okay
B	be fine yeah
A	alright is she going?
B	oh oh oh oh oh
A	oh right
B	there's nothing going in the the
A	nothing in the bus lane?
B	as far as I can see no
A	okay
B	good good good
A	ah I think the van's letting me go is it?
B	mm
A	oh there's a bus in the bus lane sorry bus
B	right so we'll just have to go into the next lane and
A	oh
A	oh my god
A	ah
A	oh
B	oh Simon's saying something what are you saying Simon?
A	oh the adrenaline
B	er I think he's
A	he's saying
B	so sorry that we're saying enough
B	if you didn't catch that we're reversing out of a space
A	yeah
A	yeah and driving in traffic where they are all drive on the wrong side of the road
A	and they haven't a bloody clue what the speed limit is half the time let never mind what the
B	or the rules are for complicated manoeuvres
A	exactly
B	watch out
A	yeah but
A	I tell you what you know
B	I'm glad I'm being very cautious
A	yeah look out there are llamas I mean I you know I don't know I don't know what what am I to be aware of? and I've discovered you see this diamond with the erm
B	uhu
A	the white thing the yellow diamond thing with the white diamond border that means go on ahead it's your right of way you don't need to stop or you know you can pass go and collect your money
B	must go
A	and all rest of it it's fine
B	uhu
A	it means be aware
A	you're going to need to stop oh
B	that's still the bus lane
A	no I need to cross the bus lane to turn right
B	oh right
A	yeah if it's got a cross through it it means you are going to have to give way not to the left to the right
B	it's just backwards
A	I know it's
B	yeah
A	but the pedestrians might be able to go
B	why is it going into that lane
A	I don't know but I'm gonna do the same
B	yes yes
A	cos that seems to be the thing to do
B	make a U turn
A	but he said turn right
B	he did he did he did
A	he did he said turn right and now he says go back the way you've just come that's really annoying
B	yep and follow it all the way round
A	yeah
B	and we need to be going in that direction
A	yeah so he wants us to go
B	so let's just go in a loop
A	yeah I'm gonna turn left here
B	okay
A	okay
B	incredibly boring
A	you're my wing woman you're responsible here just keep an eye on me and make sure I don't crash into anything
B	oh
A	oh shit that's parking
B	no just go just
B	yep
B	oh bloody hell
A	oh well
B	no I think we might be alright just just hope just hope that'll just go out there
A	yeah
B	yeah and what does that mean?
A	but no that's fine
B	well we can just use it to turn around and then just go back out
A	so I wanna go left and left and I think I can
A	I do forget that on narrow roads sometimes
B	yeah it's all
A	yeah
B	the bloody same isn't it? right so we're going right and then left?
A	we're going right then left
B	yeah
A	yeah I think going right should be easy enough cos we're sort of with the traffic cos it's on the right and then
B	yeah and on the left there should be traffic lights
A	there should be a filter yeah
B	oh it's all going very well
A	ah
B	mm garden centre shop looks nice
B	oh you know what I love on Sundays is going to a bloody garden centre in England
A	old woman
B	I once oh a Sunday had
A	give way to the BMW cos they're scary
B	I
A	and turning here
B	or are
A	or we're turning at the next one
B	no we're turning at the traffic lights
A	okay but I'm in the filter woo hoo
B	very nice
A	yeah
B	so this is what we need to do
A	oh dear
B	no on a Sunday once I didn't go out the night before so I woke up
A	wow good
B	I went to the garden centre and then did some knitting at home
A	yeah
B	it's just
A	domestic bliss
B	I just don't have time for these nightclubs the
A	you might have a second wind where that's concerned
B	yeah
A	cos I didn't really do it in my teenage years I think cos I didn't go to uni and didn't go
B	yeah
A	and then when I was about twenty-eight I started
B	yeah maybe I will
A	yeah
B	cos I did sort of eighteen to twenty-one twenty-two solidly
A	yeah that's plenty surely?
B	yeah with intermittent you know
B	er yes
A	yeah
B	but
A	alright shush it's only just gone green for goodness sake oh where are they all going?
A	can I actually drive on this bit of road? yeah I can
B	mm hm
A	but no it's a not a one way street and we're not in the bus taxi lane and we're fine but there's a red light okay we can do that
B	all going well
A	yeah so far so good
B	right
A	until we hit the motorway
B	yep
A	what could possibly go wrong?
B	right well here we were parked ten minutes ago
A	ten minutes ago yeah
B	what town is in that direction? cos Krakow is in the other direction
A	yeah
B	there even
A	mm
B	this side
A	yeah possibly
B	cos I suppose you've got to go
A	yeah but then it's four
A	four o'clock so maybe this is when people finish work
B	mm hm
A	cos I've noticed that
B	oh absolutely yeah it's rush hour
A	there's a rush hour at twelve
B	uhu
A	whereas in the UK you'd expect rush hour to be one till two
B	uhu
A	here it seems to be sort of twelve till one
B	yeah
A	uh oh
B	if they do it so slowly and quietly no one will notice
B	right well there is a naked woman on a billboard how do you feel?
A	yeah
B	well she's you know got hair
A	I've noticed that that's
B	it's so promiscuous
A	yeah I
B	mm hm oh I know where you mean
A	you know the one I mean? yeah and there's some sort of erotica dot com
B	mm hm
A	and it I don't know it just seems to be a culture full of contradictions sometimes with the whole
B	yeah it's sort of a lost generation it's all this sort of period transitional period between er
A	mm
B	very conservative traditional religion
A	yeah
B	and
B	I'm joking I'm joking
A	embracing more western cultures
B	yeah and yeah
A	I'm
B	did you
A	or at least they appear to
B	no these girls man are so up on cosmetics and
A	yeah
B	everyone has their nails done everyone
A	mm
B	you know
A	yeah
B	all of them have their nails done professionally at
A	have their nails done
B	er at a cosmetic place
B	beauty salon
B	sorry
B	erm at a beauty salon or you know they have
A	yeah
B	erm
A	it's curious
B	it is
A	I hope you know yeah I wondered about that ah no I've got an arrow I've got a straight arrow
B	I know I don't I know we've got that's still a bus lane
A	I was hoping that the erm sort of insecurities that can quite often go with that sort of beautification thing
B	mm
A	you know for me a lot of it is around you're a shit person nobody will love you unless you
B	follow the
A	yeah exactly or you know
B	mm
A	so you know I kind of hope that those insecurities don't come with this sort of wave of westernisation of the culture
B	but I think I think they've all but I think erm uh
A	I don't know
B	I think they go to more effort here than girls in in England no I don't know if that's true
A	oh Northern Ireland everyone's orange and has no eyebrows
B	no that's true yeah
A	Northern Ireland is oh
B	I don't know
B	you can't compare the two cultures I guess
A	yeah
B	but there is
A	mm hm
B	you know long hair
A	uhu
B	very
A	yeah
B	genetically have very small legs even if they have huge upper bodies
B	like
A	pin legs
A	okay
B	a marble on match sticks I think it is it's genetic
A	okay
B	erm that's why they can't lift any weights in the gym cos they've got little spindly legs
A	right that don't support them okay
B	er whereas er
A	yeah
B	more sedentary in the past don't know
A	interesting
B	uh yeah and sort of very thin very sort of natural makeup not so much over the top although some people are er but yeah always beautiful nails
A	yeah
B	everything very polished
A	Polish women tend to look quite natural
B	uhu
A	and those that do bother with makeup don't
B	over do it
A	well some over do it but most
B	uhu
A	will just have a little touch so you hardly know it's there
B	mm hm
A	have I gotta give way to that man?
B	he looks very alarmed
A	he looks really shocked that a vehicle has stopped at a crossing
B	mm hm
A	and I like that sort of more natural look Northern Irish women on the whole are pretty darned ugly I think quite naturally very beautiful
B	yeah
A	to my taste to my eye to my perceptions just went way over the top with painting themselves orange with a pinky sort of lipstick shaved their eyebrows off and paint them in again very badly
B	yeah
A	you know
B	mm hm mm hm
A	as they want to without my judgment
B	yeah
A	but I I do think Polish women to be far more attractive
B	that's
A	mm
B	erm I think they are more beautiful anyway
A	yeah
B	yeah it is absolutely
A	mm
B	erm
A	yeah
B	don't know
A	yeah
B	and I don't know why
A	feel free to you know do what you wanna do
B	yeah
A	if it brings you joy great
B	and I mean this sort of catch twenty-two with makeup where I've got bad skin because of hormones so I put makeup on it but because I'm putting makeup on it my skin's getting
A	ah
B	the skin stays bad
A	yeah
B	but I feel
A	yeah
B	erm so yeah don't know ah look it's a bellend church
A	yeah
A	yeah looks kind of painful with that cross sticking out where it is
B	like like a piercing
A	oh Prince Albert
B	Prince Albert right in there right in the end or one of those umbrella chlamydia test thing
A	oh
B	well do you know what I mean? not chlamydia
A	yes I know exactly what I mean yeah
B	is it chlamydia?
A	yeah they poke it down there oh not good
B	and then scrape out the insides
A	yeah lovely
B	mm
A	apparently that's the most painful thing a man can possibly experience
B	well it's not pushing a baby out of your vagina is it? so fuck you men
A	yeah but men don't do that
B	thank you for telling me that men can't have babies
B	I'm
A	sorry about that
A	level of conversation stating the bleeding obvious sorry about that
A	ah dear
B	yeah so we'll never know which is more painful
A	no
B	a little tiny umbrella scraping the inside of your penis out or a human a human thing a humanoid coming out of your insides
A	childbirth
B	uh
B	ah I'd quite happily scrape out the inside of some men's penises but
A	and here we have a snapshot of early twenty first millennium culture
A	yeah
B	mm
B	yeah
B	oh
B	right we've run out of things to say now so
B	it's freezing it says minus three but it feels like colder than that
A	yeah it has warmed up
B	but
A	now I'm not sure we're we're in the slow lane behind the slow lorry I'm not sure if maybe we can get in the faster lane to the side of us I don't know
B	ah fuck it let's go with the flow man we're gonna be coming off in
A	oh
B	three kilometres anyway
A	yeah
B	erm what was I gonna say?
A	what are you looking for?
B	this
A	do you want a Lypsyl thing?
B	ah no
A	too much laughter that's what that is
B	erm no er laughing makes me my asthma really bad
A	yeah
B	I think it's cos you sort of erm you don't slowly change your breathing you really dramatically change your breathing
A	yeah
B	erm it's not like if you're warming up to exercise and you slowly slowly build up
A	yeah I have a friend in Northern Ireland who gives herself asthma attacks by laughing too much
B	yeah
A	and like you she's one of life's gigglers
B	oh god another
A	you know
B	and I've never spoken to a doctor about that because on my notes it says like exercise induced or temp er change in temperature induced asthma
A	yeah
B	so if it's like
A	uhu
B	I just go oh fuck
A	oh god
B	and if I do it the other way round and it's really cold outside and I go to a hot place I'm like oh
A	so you're a bit
B	yeah but also laughing
A	yeah
B	stop laughing
A	desist from all mirth and merriment immediately
B	do yourself a damage
A	yeah
B	yeah man

B	er so I finished er Making a Murderer
A	uhu
B	this documentary that I've told you about before
A	yep
B	erm I've watched season one of The Trip with Rob Brydon and Steve Coogan
A	oh yes yeah
B	which I'd seen bits of pieces of and my friend recommended it and said I've just finished it and it's really really funny and it's just really nice to watch it's easy and the comedy is there and in some times it's just like nonsense stupid comedy and some times it's so subtle
A	yeah
B	erm
A	oh that's bite size okay
B	yeah so I've gonna start on the second season er but they're just nice to watch before bed
A	yeah
B	erm and I watched that Argentinian film which is good
A	uh huh
B	and that's it really I've not been watching a lot
A	oh that looks really good yeah I enjoyed it
B	yeah
A	I do like an Agatha Christie oh well I love sort of gentle murder mysteries really
B	mm hm
A	I gave up on Luther I think in series two or series three
B	uhu
A	it just got far too too into this and I didn't wanna be looking at all those nasty visuals and it was generally a female victim having some sort of sexual thing go on
B	yeah
A	and end up dead and I just thought no there's only so much of that you can put up with
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	in one lifetime so I stopped watching Luther which was a shame because
B	he's
A	yeah brilliant character
B	yeah
A	yeah it's good without too much gratuitous death
B	er
A	oh yes yeah
B	Silent Witness is back on Iplayer
A	or Witless Silence as my friend calls it
B	uhu
A	that Irish woman and French and Saunders did a great parody of her just sitting in her car without the windscreen wipers on as the rain fell and then all the character said was it rained
A	that's like well yeah it rained and it always seemed to be raining on Silent Witness but yeah witless silence so yeah that's good I enjoyed those
B	er yeah and it's back on and it's quite
A	yeah
B	so the last
A	I saw that one actually
B	oh did you see it?
A	yeah
B	converting female British females into jihadists
A	yeah
A	mm
B	yeah don't know
A	maybe
B	I just really like it
A	yeah no I really like it the storylines and the characters are really good
B	yeah
A	I did like sort of a few series ago erm
B	yeah what the lad the man
A	yeah yeah he got murdered or something didn't he? and I there there was some fantastic episodes where he was off in I don't know was he in Budapest or Morocco or something?
B	yeah
A	those were oh my god
B	the older one Harry
A	yes yeah yeah Harry I thought he was great too
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	uhu
A	he had the dark hair
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	yeah so I can't remember which series that was but some of the storylines there were incredibly well written
B	yeah
A	more twists and turns than a twisty turn thing yeah really good
B	yeah really like it er but I do like
A	yeah
B	or for the last couple of series that he's been in I really like him
A	yeah I don't know I suppose ah
B	yeah he is quite sort of
A	you think well okay bit of eye candy but what else is there?
B	but I like you know his sort of dedication to his job and his dedication to looking after Clarissa and Nicky er and
A	yeah
B	he's not he's not a bad egg
A	erm
B	yep
A	got the first three series on there I've watched those in the last few weeks thoroughly enjoyed them I've cos I've got this funny memory I do forget things erm
B	mm mm hm
A	and I'd read them and then a year later or three years later or five years later I could still remember exactly what was gonna happen in the story and I remember thinking
B	yeah and what do it for the same time for the first time
A	yeah and it's like the first time
B	yeah
A	and being low and behold and that happened and that's my reality now
B	uhu
A	is that I don't retain hardly anything
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	so it sucks sometimes in I've got a memory like shit but then other times like watching Sherlock again it's like I recall bits of it sometimes I might remember who the baddy is or how it turned out but for the most part I don't and it's a complete joy
B	yeah and it's like watching it new every time
A	yeah watching it again
B	yeah over Christmas I watched Jurassic Park for the first time
A	ah
B	the sort of the first time you see something I wish I had that you know
A	yeah
B	that joy or that whatever
A	do you know I haven't seen The Lion King
B	have you not?
A	no erm
B	yeah
A	there are a few of that sort of era that for young kids growing up that they're classics but for me I
B	yeah it was the first film I watched in the cinema
A	Watership Down Dumbo
B	mm hm
B	yeah
A	childhood
B	these are all my childhood classics as well so
A	mm
B	hm no
A	yeah loved that and Stars Wars the originals
B	you know what they're bringing back to TV?
A	mm
B	oh did you not? oh my god
A	no lads that I knew were really into it but I didn't really like it
B	yeah I was it was our Friday night tradition in the
A	yeah?
B	yeah we'd go
A	that's nice
B	yeah it's near the coast drive on Fridays we'd go to like the chippy er and or something and get something or erm
A	what?
B	I've just got this like memory of eating yogurts and watching Robot Wars
A	any particular special sort of yoghurt with fruit or muesli?
B	yeah like Crunch Corner Crunch Corners
A	Crunch Corner oh yeah
B	yeah or something like that like
A	wow
B	yeah
A	mm hm
B	and then Sunday traditions was a roast with Masterchef you know the old Masterchef with that man
A	no I never really got into that I had a friend who called it Mastershout
B	uhu
A	you know I think it was that stroppy aggressive male character that I just switch off at I just think grow up and learn some manners
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	erm and it wasn't like now and they were sort of all in the same room at the same time oh well is that like oh I don't know anyway
A	yeah that was where they built things out of rubbish
B	yeah
A	wow
B	yeah and
A	so you made a robot?
B	yeah or and make them move around in the kitchen
B	yeah
A	I agree
B	and not saying you can't have that it's for girls or you can't have that it's for boys I just thinking fucking play with your dolls
A	yeah
B	yep
A	that did away with that and I think with clothes as well
B	yep
A	yeah
B	erm ah all these books that are like oh
A	yeah
B	why do boys get well I'm not really interested in space or rockets or science but why do they get that?
A	yeah
B	and I get why we do we only get princesses? like
A	I know
B	shit I don't wanna be a princess
A	I had action men
B	yeah I used well I didn't have action men but I used to
B	like before I knew what sex was I used to rub him against my posh spice
A	oh my god
B	I know
A	I used to rub my Action Man against
A	or was it Sindy? I don't know it was probably one of the two
B	yeah
A	that's hilarious
B	he had like an orange jumpsuit from the music video he looked like he'd been to Guantanamo Bay
A	yeah
B	yeah God Gary Barlow dolls
A	oh dear
B	yeah so that was me
A	yeah
B	mm hm
A	so oh isn't she a pretty little thing? or er he's a tough fella like his dad you know there's all of that business
B	yeah
A	and a lot of that is culturally engrained but I do feel that
B	yeah
A	we will all have male and female characteristics and I'm reading a lot a lot about this in erm the Seth book I'm reading at the moment
B	mm hm
A	and the one I'm on at the moment it deals a lot with sex sexuality gender things like that really looking at how humanity has evolved in that way
B	mm hm
A	and there is a lot of stuff that is now nature rather than nurture
B	mm hm
A	that wasn't
B	yeah
A	it's just it's so engrained now it's kind of in the genes because it's been sort of adopted over so many generations you know this idea that men aren't feeling or sensitive
B	mm hm
A	that children are you know women's domain erm
B	mm hm
A	men go out to work you know it's all bollocks really it's just the way that things have been designed over the over the generations
B	yes and
A	yeah male logic female intuition well hang on
B	mm hm
A	yeah
B	erm yeah and gender sort of fluidity or er
A	yeah
B	time in terms of progression of erm trans rights
A	yeah
B	and erm er
A	yeah
B	stuff's happening super exciting
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	and a lot of it is about humans becoming less judgemental
B	yeah
A	if you look at sort of forties fifties sixties and you've got the whole black issue
B	mm hm
A	then you've got the female issue
B	mm hm
A	then you've got the gay issue
B	gay
A	then you've got the disability issue and now you've got the trans issue
B	mm hm
A	so it's almost like humanity has found all of these ways
B	yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	to divide and separate themselves but finally
B	yeah we're sort of ticking things off the list
A	yeah
B	I mean always gonna have to go back over things and it's not quite right yet it's not quite right yet and it's gonna take forever and forever but
A	yeah
B	erm
A	massive progress in just even sixty-seventy years if you look at the
B	oh absolutely yeah
A	world yeah
B	so
A	it's all good
B	it's all getting well it's getting
A	yeah
B	oh yeah absolutely
A	yeah
B	it's all good
A	yeah
B	uhu
A	full stop
B	people mm hm
A	very much
B	yeah
A	you need darkness you need contrast you need
B	mm hm
A	he's doing a brilliant job of
B	yeah giving us a something to work against something to push against or erm
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	so people then wake up to what they do want this is
B	yeah that's a good point
A	you know on a sort of microcosm of all of that is where I've been at this last two or three weeks since coming back since coming back from Christmas break is I'm bloody bored some days
B	mm hm
A	and
B	yeah
A	what can I do here now today in my life
B	what will make me happiest? yeah
A	to make this wonderful and
B	yeah
A	I don't know what I want and then you get someone like Cameron
B	well yeah uhu
A	and it at least helps you to shape your life and to create your life
B	yeah you can you can
A	yeah
B	mm hm
A	oh okay well not that so what the
B	yeah
A	what's the opposite? well what are the alternatives?
B	yeah
A	but I need to find something for the four weeks of February
B	yoga?
A	yeah very possibly I can engage with the day classes at yoga er and there's a woman there actually an older woman who's name I've completely forgotten who speaks very good English
B	uhu
A	and she was talking about erm taking some lessons with me but I think it's maybe I'll just suggest we go out for coffee a couple of times a week
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	I don't know
A	trans issues and what a great film Pride is
B	oh man
A	yeah
A	movie night
B	I could bloody talk about this film for ever and ever and ever
A	ah I can't believe it had passed me by until a few months ago and a friend it and we watched it
B	yeah
A	and I just thought what a magnificent feel good film
B	yeah
A	twenty fifteen sometime wasn't it?
B	and it must have been the beginning of twenty fifteen cos I've known of this for quite a long time erm and
A	yeah yeah
B	and then I just sort of watched it continually since
A	I
B	yep
A	so definitely get a movie night sorted part of why it was amazing for me was cos it was erm you know the erm you know the at the beginning of the film they go on that Pride march and I think it's nineteen eighty-nine or something like that
B	yep
A	my first Pride march was nineteen ninety
B	uhu
A	I was there ninety-one and then I think skipped a few years and then ninety-five
B	uhu
A	and then didn't bother after that but I can remember a Pride march in London in nineteen ninety and being spat at being shouted at being verbally abused erm
B	yeah
A	cos people in the police force who wanted to go on Pride march that was the only way they could do
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	was to be police erm and to you know that was the only way they could engage with the event but
B	yeah saw it
A	no I didn't see the miners' strike like people who lived in different parts of the UK did
B	yeah
A	although I was very very aware of it cos it was all over the media
B	mm hm mm hm yes I just missed all of this
B	yeah
A	like I said earlier I think Thatcher and Reagan really defined how the next few decades were gonna go and Thatcher it wasn't
B	mm hm
A	that really had such a profound impact on the UK I feel
B	I don't know how old I was at my first Pride I don't know twelve thirteen
A	oh brilliant
B	yeah and my parents go every year to Manchester or to Liverpool
A	that's nice
B	yeah
A	yeah
A	that's funny I joined a gay youth group when I was still at school I think I was fifteen sixteen and there were two other girls from my school at this youth group
B	oh that's nice
A	yeah
B	mm hm
A	actually one of them is the friend who's moving with her partner to Rotterdam
B	ah ha nice
A	yeah
B	mm hm
A	yeah
A	tired?
B	it's so yeah a little bit but you know it's just so not a
B	oh I don't know
B	I'm sorry
B	funny
A	yeah
B	you can't say
A	no you fuck off
B	fucking bell end
B	and like
A	it's probably quite appropriate for an eighteen-year-old boy to to know that
B	oh yeah absolutely
A	I had one student who every week had this sweatshirt that said like give a fuck obviously in English
B	yeah I've got one who always wears like really rude jumpers and
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	I said you've been wearing it for weeks
B	yeah
A	so yeah
B	lots of people say this
A	yeah interesting
B	I know I'm happy to swear all the time but I think if you see the letters
A	what are you going around with? yeah
B	yeah and I see people
B	yeah I know
B	and I'm like do you just not know or do you not care? or you know
A	could be arrested public disorder offences
B	funny
A	interesting
B	yeah sure
A	getting cold feet
A	I've been sleeping loads lately and I do wonder if it's that sort of
A	you know work thing and I've been going to bed between nine and ten and falling asleep between nine and ten
B	where did that conversation change occur?
A	well
B	oh right sorry
A	and then
B	yes
[ANNOTATION]	Person B think that conversation has been changed	Entailment
A	I've been waking up any time between six and half seven generally
B	uhu
A	but if I've fallen asleep at half nine I'm still getting loads of sleep
B	yeah
A	yeah exactly
B	yeah last night I was like right I really must do a little bit more of this Spanish and then I went no
B	so just listen
A	I agree
B	I swear to god
A	yes
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Person B think if you listen to the language you can improve it	Entailment
A	I really can't get over that there's a you know a Facebook slogan pops up now again stop the glorification of busy and I can I can understand that and engage with that sentiment but
B	mm hm
A	they work right through
B	yeah good for him
A	and I think that's great and I think
B	mm hm
A	hallelujah
B	yeah that's a good point
[ANNOTATION]	Person B is going to do some hair cut	Contradiction
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	it's good
B	I don't know
B	I'm really sorry I'm just working it out first before I continue
A	uhu
B	but lazy in terms of er
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Person A is going to dance	Contradiction
B	erm
A	yeah
B	and you go right enough's enough sorry it's my time now bye
A	yeah
B	erm and it's you know it's not easy to do and not everybody does it er but I've always been really sort of self aware of work not running into your normal life
A	mm
B	and in this job it's hard you know you're working at home or preparing at home
[ANNOTATION]	Person B believe that the gap is useful for him	Contradiction
A	yeah
B	where is that sort of erm
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	and once the timer goes off then
A	stop preparing
B	stop preparing it's either finished or it's not and if it's not it's your own fault
A	yeah
B	er and yeah that's the only way I can do it
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	cos lesson
B	mm hm
A	so if you've planned the entirety of it you maybe have less flexibility then sometimes
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	er you can't say
B	six hours
A	yeah
B	erm that remaining two hours but you can have a go
A	yeah
B	yeah and do the planning then
A	and it's yeah up to you to then balance when you do the planning so day is like the next day
B	mm hm
A	yeah
B	falls into place erm
A	mm
B	you know and I compare myself to friends who live in London for example and they don't have enough time in the day to do anything
A	yeah
B	you know they're on an hour commute on public transport er transport working all day
A	yeah
B	it's just a bit pants er and
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	I got such a kick out of it
B	yeah
A	yeah and I always
B	yeah and people say they feel like that as well
A	yeah
B	yeah lugging the furniture yeah
A	three flights of stairs and things like that
B	yeah
A	so that's very physical as well
B	mm hm
A	whereas I think in other jobs where I've worked a lot of hours and it's just been desk based I've really struggled with that because I haven't been able to move my body
B	mm hm
A	yeah
B	yeah that's
A	yeah
B	and in terms of you saying
A	yeah
B	I think there is other ways to
A	yeah
B	more and more and especially in this job it's simply by saying it to the boss I say to
A	yeah
B	erm and like I'm not saying I'm doing it to
A	yeah
B	but I'm making sure that I'm fucking telling her because erm
A	yeah good for you
B	you know she's the one who's going be writing references for me so I need her to see
A	I'm sure she would mind if you added onto the end of that sentence just remember this when you're writing my reference please
B	well yeah I'm I'm
A	she's the sort of person I imagine you could say that to
B	yeah and like I've not said it like that but I'm writing her a list and when I say is it okay if you write my references? here's the things I think are important
A	definitely
B	or would you consider putting them in?
A	definitely
B	you know
A	yeah
B	it's not like I'm telling her what to write and it's just you know she's busy she's got so many teachers
A	exactly
B	she might forget all the times I've done X Y Z
A	yeah
B	yeah giving her
A	saves her having to sit and think so
B	so
A	and you're right she won't remember it all and she's got a few hundred teachers so
B	yeah
A	no
B	I don't know it depends on the job I guess
A	it seems to be a sort of an equation with a bit of victimhood and martyrdom erm
B	in what way?
A	seem to equate with hard work or you know oh I'm so tired oh I'm really sick erm
B	mm hm
A	oh I was working till midnight last night
B	mm hm
A	and I don't you know maybe some bosses are impressed by that maybe that is a mark of dedication
B	if I was a boss I'd be like bloody hell get a life
A	yeah I would think that shows such a
B	I'd be a terrible boss probably
A	such a such a lack of respect of self really
B	mm hm
A	it's not necessarily a quality that you want to see in people
B	mm hm
A	yeah actually saying that when I worked for
B	mm hm
A	but I think it kind of suited her as far as traffic and transport and getting lift and travel and things like that went
B	yeah
A	and she didn't lord it as a symbol of martyrdom but I used to say to her you're a mug you know you're a complete mug don't expect anybody
B	mm hm
A	but I was saying it to her you know obviously we had a good relationship and I express my appreciation and gratitude for the wonderful work that she did she was the best manager on the team by far but I'd say to her don't expect anybody to thank you for this don't expect anybody to recognise or appreciate this
B	yeah
A	no exactly so if you do it you do it for yourself if you expect anything you're a mug
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	other than going to work earlier and they don't owe you for it
A	and
B	yeah
A	you know
B	exactly
A	yeah anyway maybe I'm a bit harsh on that front
B	yes
A	but I suppose I'm recognising in people a lot of what I recognise in myself historically
B	yeah
A	you know young
B	and I
A	yeah
B	or I would just you know I'm not just at the point in my career yet where I can just roll in
A	yeah
B	ten minutes before like the Polish teachers do whack on the photocopier goes to the lesson
A	yeah
B	I need the time to organise it make a coffee sort of deep breath ready to go
A	that's fair enough
B	erm
A	yeah five O two
B	erm
A	let's see what the sign says I'm not sure if I'm gonna follow Simon
B	so you know I'm not quite
A	does this say
B	yeah
A	yes it does right Simon I'll believe you
B	mm
A	she's so dedicated
B	they're probably going
A	yeah
B	is she lonely?
A	yeah
B	does is it
A	oh I suppose if it helps your mental well-being and helps your stress levels then that's fair enough
B	yeah it does
A	but it's all fair enough anyway
B	erm so
A	mm
B	and get it down to only going a half hour early
A	the back up of course is if you get there and there's a problem with the photocopier or whatever
B	well yeah exactly
A	is if you can do what you need for your first lesson and leave anything else with the reception guys
B	yeah
A	cos they're brilliant at you know doing the extras and coming into your room and leaving it with you so
B	oh
A	I know there are no speed limits on this road
B	yeah when
B	forty minutes
A	oh my god
B	yeah and I was like oh goodness me
A	yeah she's a fast driver
B	she is but I feel really comfortable in her hands
A	yeah
B	when she's driving
A	I do
B	you know it's her job
A	yeah
B	and she has extra training for like snow on motorways and driving fast and driving under weather conditions
A	yeah
B	so I feel kind of okay
A	she's good
B	yeah and especially like when
A	yeah
B	is all
A	yep
B	yeah buddy
A	I think we've passed the real supermarket
B	mm hm
A	the real supermarket
B	poss
A	no I don't think we do go past
B	right
A	er instead but if you know an alternative route tell me
B	well this is the way that the
A	ah
B	er and this is you know how I managed to get out there
A	oh pretty lights on the roundabout they're really nice
B	aren't they nice?
B	and all of these cars were like really cautiously driving around a massive bauble
A	oh dear
A	it's a bit random isn't it?
B	and blocking two lanes of traffic
A	this is a funny road cos it's got seventy kilometres per hour on here and then I think bits of it are fifty but I'm not quite sure
B	mm
A	but nobody takes any notice of speed limits anyway so
B	yeah
A	not wanting to hold people up
B	yeah
A	but at the same time wanting to be aware that there are pedestrian crossings that I might need to stop
B	mm hm
A	or might not erm yeah
B	yeah
A	and then it just gets like it's a big wide road
A	and you think maybe it's ninety?
B	no but only for this little
A	yeah I know it's random it does get a bit random
B	all I needed all that water but now I really need the loo
B	uh
A	no I'm alright I think that little bit I managed to squeeze out in
B	feels nice
A	yeah
B	have another litre before bed if I can
A	yeah me too I think I'm still detoxing you know
B	yes three weeks without alcohol erm losing water weight
A	yep
B	er from Christmas and sugar weight and bloat
A	uhu
B	erm
B	either way
A	oh jesus
B	one or seven days I can't remember
A	right so
B	I know that the time to make a habit is a lot shorter than to break a habit but I
A	okay
B	the specifics don't know
A	some time
A	I don't know
B	anyway
A	I thought it was three weeks for both but I don't know
B	no
A	I guess it's all individual anyway isn't it? so
B	well yeah three weeks or well nearly on three weeks of gym and three weeks of no drinking three weeks of listening to Woman's Hour on Radio four and doing the crosswords and eighteen nineteen twenty days of learning Spanish
A	yay
B	I'm so I am not appreciated enough
B	just like I expected an angel to come from heaven and go you know what?
A	good job
B	you're doing great
B	er
A	yeah pat on the back keep going yeah go
B	is this you or the angel?
A	no this is me being the angel talking to you
B	oh right okay
A	like rah rah rah
A	more glowing baubles randomly distributed in
B	I really wish like we were also filming this so that more people could understand what we're seeing
A	I know
B	I know they're analysing the language and not actually what we're saying
A	yeah
B	and there is a difference between them
A	they're only gonna get a half a picture really without seeing these
B	yeah cos I do that in work
A	red glowing orbs
B	and it's really hard to you know see the difference between what people are saying and the way they're saying it
A	mm hm
B	you know
A	yeah
B	but fuck me listening to people speaking English is boring listening to stories is great
B	mm
A	no
B	it's crap isn't it?
A	yeah it's rubbish cos you don't get to enjoy the beautiful scenery and see all of the buzzards
B	mm
A	I do particularly like buzzards
B	you just see clear plastic with fucking birds silhouetted onto them
A	it's not just birds
B	as though it's the same
A	buzzards
B	oh is that what they are?
A	yeah buzzard silhouettes
B	oh I just thought it was any old
A	no and the ones that are in
B	yeah I've seen them before
A	I couldn't work out what bird it was but it wasn't a buzzard
B	yeah
A	mm
B	I think it's just a generic bird
A	no no the ones in
B	just think it's a tremendous waste of the view for what reason?
B	unless to sort of keep sort of pollution away from the trees
A	mm
B	mm
A	wind?
B	mm
A	I don't know
B	there's no rivers it's not like they're blocking
A	no flooding
B	uhu
A	and there are the the drainage system is amazing
B	mm
A	I wonder if in the UK the drainage system is equally amazing but it all seems to be underground perhaps but here
B	mm
A	so yeah I'm going right here aren't I?
B	yeah please
A	yeah
B	mm
A	mm
B	I saw a load of ducks in the river or in the canal
A	oh yeah
B	whatever it was and it was iced over
A	yeah
A	oh I can go
B	yeah so did I
A	and I put my foot down to turn round the corner and there are pedestrians crossing
B	and it's hard as a pedestrian as well when you're sort of crossing a road on a green man and a car comes screaming towards you
A	yeah
B	mm hm
A	erm but particularly at night now as a driver there are no flashing orange lights
B	yeah
A	to indicate there's a crossing so you might just see a silhouette of a human
B	yeah and try not to kill them
A	yeah try not kill anybody
B	I get so pissed off when they don't stop erm
A	yeah
B	and I've just I've just started like not even really looking and just walking out
A	yeah oh jeez steady
B	because otherwise I'm just gonna stand there all day cos they don't wanna stop
A	yeah
B	for me despite the fact it's like minus whatever degrees and they're just you know oh you're so nice and warm in your car are you? that's nice
A	yeah I'm fucking freezing
A	and I need to get home and cook my lasagne
B	I'm so excited for this lasagne
A	good for you
B	lasagne dot com might put it in the oven again just to get the extra warmth instead of in the microwave
A	yeah probably teach my granny to suck eggs here you probably know this already but transfer it into a different dish because if you put a dish in the oven that's already been into the oven
B	well it's in Tupperware now so I'd have to put it back into its lasagne
A	oh okay
B	into back its
A	cos it's clean
B	giant lasagne yeah otherwise it would just keep on burning
A	yeah
B	mm hm
A	so you can only get it off one of them evil scourer things that has the pink glue come out
B	yeah and I think this has some like non-stick or stuff on it and I don't really want to
A	oh wow
B	I don't know but I don't want to er ruin it
A	yeah
B	my new lasagne
A	you've just bought it
B	dish that I can only use half of cos it's just too big
B	again really
B	so sorry
A	well
B	oh well
A	linguistic structure I don't think the actual words matter so much I don't know or maybe they do
B	maybe they do
A	maybe they do where am I turning for you? here?
B	er there
B	stellar job in this cold weather
A	jesus she is
B	I know
A	they're mental
B	can't bear it
A	fall over and break a leg
B	I know I can't I'm such a sort of what's the word? neurotic about this sort of stuff er okay say bye
A	mm
B	bye
