B	the thing about our lovely
A	mm
B	and as a consequence he is I mean it's a little bit frustrating sometimes
A	mm
B	so for instance I will send him a design like a Photoshop document you know with all the designs on it or I'll send him a text that needs to go on the website
A	yeah
B	you know and I'll write him an email and it's all like it's got a title saying attachment for blah blah blah
A	yeah
B	design for
A	I love it
A	no subject
B	no subject is
A	they're just er
B	basically what you need to with this
A	yes
B	I give him you know step-by-step instructions about it
A	mm
B	I would say and I'm not exaggerating nine times out of ten he asks me to send it to him again after having been completely confused he'll be like erm you know several weeks later when it actually is getting done he'll be like oh and erm I'll need the design for
A	yeah yes on such and such a date
B	on such and such a date oh I don't think no it's in my inbox yes it is in your inbox cos I sent it to you and I know that I did
A	it's sent and all that stuff yes
B	and that's problem number one and it does irritate me
A	ah
B	because I want to be doing the thing where it's like I've done that it's behind me
A	I know
B	I've crossed it off my list I've done it I've moved on
A	I know what I don't like
B	and he is never almost never on the ball and he said this to us erm kind of as a not as a way he's not apologetic at all he says I can't do things unless I'm actually working on on it at the time it's basically not worth your while
A	so sorry don't bother sending it to me I'll ask you when I need it
B	but you know really?
A	I'm not very good with with that in one way in that they send me information in three weeks' time you will need to pay these people they don't know exactly how much yes yet but this is the invoice
B	yeah
A	I need the real invoice
B	yeah don't send me the maybe
A	don't send me the maybe and then it turns out that they so I file the maybe just you know in case but I'm hoping I never have to retrieve it
B	I know yeah no
A	the thing that I didn't want to see in the first place please
B	well this is the this is problem number one and
A	he's not
B	not even criticism but like if you will say to him listen dear erm this is really annoying what I send you which I have done by the way when I send you an email with an attachment put it in a folder even if you don't do anything with the email
A	it's got a name
B	and then you'll know
A	yeah
B	that you've got the files that you need when it comes to the thing but he gets a bit upset yeah a bit defensive
A	mm I don't do that sort of thing
B	well not he knows that he does it but he refuses to be apologetic and he refuses to try and change
A	mm
B	the way that he works and that's not as cool because we've all changed the way that we work you know some some like all of us have our things like
A	mm
B	and erm full on with that side of things
A	yeah erm
B	and she offends people with her way
A	the Greek people have gone off her
B	the Greek people didn't like her at all and it it wasn't the first time that's happened in fairness she is she can be just a little bit I think some people find it patronising
A	yes
B	that she sort of assumes that you're working for her a little bit but she you tell her this and she's so
A	can't believe that it's yeah
B	takes it in and is like really okay and I'm you know and she tries so hard to change the way that she does it and
A	yes I have to say it reminds me a bit of dad
B	she gets a bit upset but yeah
A	he I'll hear him on the phone and he'll he'll laugh at people and I'll think I'm just
A	and they that they kind of got to know that he's a nice man and he doesn't mean it and he's laughing and it's not hurtful you know but he's actually extremely rude
B	offensive
A	and when they don't know him you can sometimes hear the bristling
B	ooh yeah definitely I've heard him on the phone as well and I've thought ow
A	ow me too
A	yes you did what?
A	no
B	cos we're his like we're good friends of his and you know we really it's obvious that we have lot of respect for him by default it's you know it there's no there should be no issue there should be no question of that really so that just yeah so today he's been in top spaced out form so he's sending all these emails which are erm
A	I do yeah
B	he was erm
A	tell me that woman didn't put me two bits of butter for three pieces of fish
B	erm yeah
A	mm
B	but despite having these kind of things that he did which were difficult sometimes to deal with and also for the same reason that he was also just a very spaced out person you always forgave him no matter what
A	shall I make a little bit of parsley sauce?
B	yeah
B	let's put two in the erm
A	no I don't mean
B	we're going to the pub now anyway
A	I know we are we're alright oh look I bought creamy parsley sauce do we want that? I could add some parsley to it no I'll make my own with the butter that's nice
B	I'll put two in anyway cos
A	yeah cos that how could you resist
B	they're very nice these little dinky beers
A	they're little
B	mm
A	I've found those plums rather attractive too
B	yeah I love them as well
B	plums and soon its erm tangerine time
A	yes I love erm the peaches though all year you know even when they're not
B	yeah well that's the good thing is that you can still get them right put that away
A	okay so this is your other wash
B	I want to wear something nice when
A	well everything will be ready
B	maybe we can go on Friday
A	you've got another day
B	you're right this is not really stuff to wear in the midst of the Cumbrian winter well it's not winter but it might as well be
A	well the jeans with
B	the jeans will be alright
A	layers
B	yeah
A	there you go
B	I'm going thinking about purchasing such a thing I've got a little bit of cash
A	purchasing a little final layer
B	and I see it being spent on such a thing
A	mm
B	especially seeing as my that my favourite jumper was stolen by the Indian landlord
A	by the by the fairies
B	ooh yeah
A	not the cardigan but the other stuff
B	fair enough zhuzhing is always fine
A	erm just to take the heavy wet off it
B	yeah
A	and the
B	mm
A	but the black stuff can I kind of completely dry?
B	erm maybe not the jeans cos they shrink
A	maybe have a little look in ten minutes see if there's
B	don't they?
A	well I always find they restretch
B	well these have a lot of elastic in them forgiving Next
A	yeah so I find these they go well they are elastic anyway but they they you know I have to kind of put them on but then within ten minutes they're back to quite
B	yeah I know I find the same with them actually you have to do a bit of a gymnastical move at the beginning squats
B	and then they're ready to go
A	right erm so
A	oh dear
B	yeah he's er
A	tell him he just need to try and work for the
A	cheek of it I'll have words with him in jest
A	that is definitely in jest
B	a joke
A	I'll have words with him about that as well
A	and then you're
B	and then it wasn't happening any more
C	so
B	I like them and I'm wearing them all day
A	we're washing all of her clothes
C	they usually for er nighttime though
B	just for bed? I don't agree this is the home office er life
C	scales?
B	is that the scale that you've been learning?
C	yes
B	sounds cool sounds jazzy
C	well it's
B	has it got a name you told me didn't you?
C	diminished
B	it's all it's not all full tones is it?
C	full tones?
B	full tones
C	no that's erm pentatonic
B	yeah
C	what?
B	flattened fifth flattened seven?
C	no that's the blues scale
A	the thing is you've got the heating now set on eighteen all day everyday
B	it's freezing
C	it's alright
A	well
C	voted
A	a glass of wine
C	well that didn't last long then did it?
C	I wouldn't wouldn't exactly say that you're
A	I stood I withstood all the pressure
C	oh yes a glass of wine
A	I'm not very good at the austerity biff
B	with the wine austerity it's been a stressful day with the er choir administration
A	stressful day
C	your daughter has a bad influence she's encouraging you
A	it is all her fault yes
C	encouraging you
A	I tried to steal her beer and she said no oi you go to the pub
B	those were not my exact words but
C	were you going to steal a beer without me knowing?
A	I was I was going to just on the quiet
B	I just thought she can have a beer but it's not really going to satisfy the er the true the true craving
A	oi I'm making a delicious meal here and people are scoffing bickie's alright left and centre
A	sorry darling?
C	is it vegetables?
A	no it's fish potatoes
C	oh fish oh great
A	spinach and broccoli
C	mm
A	and parsley sauce
B	it'll give you like all your omega three in one go
A	so what do you say to that young man?
C	mm
A	would you like to chop me a bit of parsley?
C	could do
B	come on dad expand your culinary
C	I've been criticised for my chopping skills
A	I'm hoping you'll be able to recognise the difference
B	do you actually chop an onion and stuff for your cottage pie?
C	oh you heard the story did you?
B	no
A	I haven't told her see I haven't dobbed you in
B	did you have to wear spectacles?
C	I've been criticised for my onion chopping
A	he left the skin on
B	oh
A	and just sort of randomly poked into it from all directions and then tried to fish the skin out
B	dad
C	mm
A	so there's we've had three shepherd's pies all all of which have been delicious but even at the second one he decided that peeling the potatoes was a waste of time so he would put them in in their skins you know and just mush it up with the skin on
B	dad
C	it was delicious wasn't it?
B	it depends on the potatoes but yeah it can be especially if you use new potatoes then there's a there's a special fancy word for it like crush crushed potatoes or something
A	yeah but that's not what you put on top of your shepherd's pie is it?
B	well you could
A	and then he didn't have any proper cheese
B	onion is pretty key to the whole process
A	and he didn't have any other cheese so he mushed up the potatoes with their skin and then he decided to put feta
B	feta on the cottage pie dad?
A	erm
B	and was it nice?
A	it actually I have to take it all back cos I just went I said look
B	swallow your
A	follow the recipe for at least once
C	well when there's no other cheese in the house what are you supposed to do?
A	just have it without cheese but actually it tasted delicious so who can say
C	well there you go so what you talking about
A	mm
C	there seems to be one snag with your er your theory we only have we only got no white
A	I only bought red
B	she didn't buy white that's why we have to go to the pub to get it
C	deary me
B	well the the first step was made but unfortunately the second second step has proved a hurdle which is the actual not drinking of wine
A	sorry
C	so
C	all the places
B	no
C	of all places it's in
C	yeah
B	sounds good
C	so I'm thinking I should invite my mother
B	ah that'll be nice
A	okay my love you're on chopping here you are take this just hang it up there okay
C	before I start erm is there a recognised technique to this chopping
A	no as it happens my lovely it's actually pretty damn easy
B	finally dad finally
A	just keep going till it's a bit frothy
B	very nice dad
C	what
B	it's just very funny to see you with a
C	what? right
B	cool
A	we need the erm need the what-do-you-me-call-it whisk
A	what's he demanding
B	he just does this thing where he'll ask me to do something on Viber and then about a millisecond later he'll be like have you done yet?
B	and then he'll make a joke out of it but actually he would like it to be done that quickly
A	he really would
B	if it was him we would we would we would not be drawing breath
A	right that's grand you I I don't need it any smaller than that my love that's beautiful
B	are you using a fork?
A	that was what you did with the onion you had a knife and fork at it that was what made me smile about it
B	that's really funny
B	no not at all it's just it's erm
C	I think the word is creative and
B	if you like yeah
C	unconventional
B	ah mm it's not the er it's not the accepted wisdom in terms of chopping to use a fork funnily enough cos you do use them to eat our dinner but it's more for the shovelling to the mouth than the er chopping
C	yes okay
B	you're supposed to do something really canny like put your fingers like this if you have a sharp knife you hold the thing like that and then the knife goes along this part of your finger instead of it then you don't chop the end of your fingers off
C	oh that's always helpful
B	well yeah people do sometimes
A	okay I need three plates
B	I'm being a bit slow at the moment with everything I'm not sure why
A	oh
B	we've done all the things we needed to do though today
A	oh I've not rung
B	yeah I know I know that tactic I'm also very good at it
B	you're supposed to do them first
A	yeah
B	that's the erm that's the advice I've had
A	received wisdom
B	mm
B	we should put some flowers in the room as well in the bedroom
A	the what pet?
B	we should put some of those flowers in the bedroom as well
A	oh definitely
B	to make it nice
A	we've got to do everything to make it beautiful for him so he feels properly looked after
B	yeah I can do that
A	just that's it there and er put it the strainer
A	you've got half of it on the floor
A	oh dear
B	oh my
B	is that too much?
A	that's fine there is going to be a bit of fish but you can just put it at the side of it
B	well we'll just do a nice green blob like that
A	yeah
B	like that
A	yeah
B	ooh erm
A	very well off for the green bits
B	mm and the little it's supposed to be good for you
B	okay
A	okay did rather demolish the kitchen but other than that is has all been very successful
B	mm
A	there's a little more
B	potati?
A	tattys if it's too much I'll just
B	that's fine thank you
A	I've already taken one off
B	oh that would be a bit of a pile
A	it's a little bit generous on the tatty front there's a little bit more parsley sauce if you would like
B	thank you expertly chopped parsley in that as well
C	now there's no need for this sarcasm
C	you haven't tasted my cottage pie
B	I know well I'm never going to probably unless I have a change of heart on the old veggie front
C	oh okay
B	make me a vegetarian version
C	oh oh
B	it was interesting in that programme Bronowski programme
C	Bronowski
B	the first one he's doing the showing the evolution of man from the apes you know? that was his that's what the first programme's about and erm it's sort of it's quite funny because it's quite old-fashioned like you know the way it all looks and stuff
A	mm
B	he goes on the computer and it's like this
C	that was state-of-the-art then
B	it was state-of-the-art then and the whole programme was probably really state-of-the-art you know the way they do the montages with the music and it's all very now it's kind of you recognise it but I think then it was all very creative wasn't it? anyway he he shows on the computer the how the skulls
A	oh sorry
B	erm the different skulls that they've found at that time I don't know what it's like now if they've found a lot mine but er skulls of the different
C	yeah it was interesting wasn't it?
B	developments and one of the thing that he showed was that the three were like branches away from human from apes that developed into other types of apes and there was a a branch that developed into humans you know so
C	mm
B	some of them were meat eaters and remained so and they developed different teeth and a different jaw and and their brain changed and the main thing was the brain and the teeth which distinguished er development into human beings from other
C	mm
A	mm mm
B	evolution of apes into other species of ape instead you know? that was the interesting thing that it was saying
A	yeah
B	so their brain specifically was growing much much bigger and their diet was changing I mean I think they they evolved from the I can't remember if this is true whether we evolved from cos they were were herbivores originally weren't they?
C	yes they came down from the trees on to the savannah
B	yeah
C	and then they started to hunt and the hunt obviously meant that they were having animal meat
B	yeah and they were actually physically very small creatures and quite weak physically and that's why they had to develop
C	develop tools
B	tools in order to survive in the savannah environment
A	and was it to cut up the meat as well?
B	erm I don't think so no
C	yeah
B	I think they cut the meat up did they? didn't they just eat it directly?
C	no I think they cut it up
B	did they? mm
A	well
B	they had like very very simple tools
A	mm
B	and the other thing that was interesting because of their physical size is that they had to hunt together
A	mm
B	so you know then you have like a social species as opposed to like cats for instance who are like more of individual species because they hunt alone
A	yeah
B	but we're like dogs because we hunt together
A	yeah
B	and then there's the sort of group the social behaviour starts you can see that even in the monkeys like if you watch the monkeys I watch them sometimes in India in the retreat place cos there's loads of them how they behave with each other they're completely social animals you never see monkey on its own doing it's one thing you know?
A	mm mm
C	right
A	no
B	and erm like dogs are like that as well and therefore they develop kind of an emotional like the difference between cats and dogs dogs are not are emotionally needy
C	mm
B	and they need like affection and communication in order to feel happy whereas cats
A	a little but not much
B	a little bit but not much
C	oh
A	a little but not yeah like Jay comes and sits on you
C	Jay yeah
B	but they are very domesticated pet cats aren't they?
A	mm
C	mm
B	and they've developed the
A	no a cat
B	mostly alone
A	mm
C	I think they also they also think that the switch to meat er was part of the thing that enabled the brain to get bigger
B	yeah they said that as well
C	because the meat is much richer in protein obviously
B	different food yeah and then
C	cos of climate change
B	why did he say that was?
C	cos of the climate change
B	cos of the climate change and then there was an ice age there were two ice ages and there were small groups of humans Homo sapiens let's say that survived the ice age
C	mm
B	but in order to do so they had to develop quite sophisticated techniques because they weren't built survive that kind of temperature so they started to live in caves
A	mm
B	and they started to migrate with the animals so like for instance they'd follow a herd of reindeer on their natural migration because the reindeer was their source of food
A	mm
B	so they just followed it
A	mm
B	and that's how kind of more of a nomadic lifestyle started to develop
C	mm
A	and also that the animals probably had the instinct of where to go that it was warmer or for protection from the winter and all that
B	yeah it's altogether a good idea isn't it? to follow them but they didn't I mean humans don't have a natural migratory instinct
A	no
B	they're not migrating they're not a migrating species
A	no
B	they're just trying to survive er they what he's saying is that they started to consciously develop erm strategies of survival that weren't just inherent they weren't like you know a salmon swims up the river it doesn't decide to that's its
A	no I see what you mean
B	preprogrammed
C	instinctive
A	so there was a a definite choice
C	adaptive yeah so there's a certain kind of there's an element of conscious decision involved you know that that in in how they decided to and that's obviously a huge difference between
A	I'm sorry my love I have eaten my whole dinner
B	you have
C	were you hungry?
B	you were ready for the pub already
A	I was starving hungry
B	I was hungry
A	and you've nicely sat and chatted
A	I'm just eating my dinner
B	I actually eat quite slowly I notice that
A	mm
C	yeah that was an interesting thing wasn't it? cos he followed erm he went to have a look at some tribes today
B	yeah
C	which was on
B	Iran it was
C	was it oh yes
C	and the the tribe was entirely dependent on cattle or whatever the animal was some form of cattle
B	sheep wasn't it?
C	was it?
B	no goats
C	goats yeah
B	yeah
C	erm his comment was that the fact that they spent all their time chasing goats that was their entire life and they had no time or energy left for anything other than survival
B	he was trying to prove wasn't he? that the following step was to settle in erm stable communities develop agriculture
A	develop a way of living without following
B	yeah exactly because nomadic life was so
A	mm
B	erm all
C	a little bit yeah
B	but
C	he did say it was his personal view didn't he?
B	the whole thing is his personal view and
A	yeah what's amazing when you look back and something like that is that probably he's very close to what people still believe and but he was it was quite extraordinary for somebody to have
B	very influential yeah
A	that theory then
C	yeah
B	well it is a really interesting programme and erm
A	I love thinking that in the seventies with that you know ludicrous computers and all of these things that they sent a man to the moon
C	yeah
B	that's true
C	in the sixties actually
A	it it yeah it's hardly people didn't have a computer then did they?
C	no
A	erm at home
C	just a research thing
A	erm and they sent a man to the moon
B	yeah that's true it's amazing
A	it's extraordinary isn't it? so sorry yes I know that's a diversion
B	no
A	but er
B	in the er the series that
A	ah I've heard of it I haven't watched it
B	yeah have you heard of it? yeah so basically it's about these this advertising agency in New York in the nineteen sixties and the whole series spans across a decade from nineteen sixty to nineteen seventy-one of the and one of the things that I think people like about it and that's made it popular is that it kind of shows the development in American society at that time which was so significant and erm it's really kind of they've tried to keep it very very real so for instance like the first episode you watch you're watching it's all set in an office so it's kind of like a professional environment
A	mm mm
B	and then they follow the characters home and obviously get you get involved in their domestic life as well but erm for instance like the way that they speak to woman
A	mm
B	and treat them in in that environment is like completely shocking
A	mm
B	and they don't you know they obviously tried to replicate exactly how it would be you know?
C	yeah
B	erm but anyway the cool it's really that's a nice thing about because they there's so so many things happened in that decade
A	mm
B	that you know about as being culturally significant you know and inventions that were starting to happen and the whole kind of birth of consumerism really
A	mm
B	people this is because it's an advertising agency you kind of become aware of it of people wanting
C	mm
B	and brand having brand identity and stuff
A	interesting I
B	there's no
[ANNOTATION]	Brand identity has always existed	Contradiction
A	inexplicit mm that'll do anyway
B	so they did you know drink a lot go out partying and erm and cheat on their wives effectively so there is that element I think that's also more just a reflection of what they were what it was actually like because it was such an male environment as well
A	mm
B	and they went to work and it was as if they had a different life there
A	mm
B	that they could have the freedom to do whatever they wanted and then they went home and they had their family life and it was very very two very separate things and their wives were not
A	aware of
B	involved or aware they were just like at home being you know a nineteen fifties housewife really and then there were some women in the office who erm gradually had started to you know be able to have an independent life but it was you know it was the sixties so like things did start to change
A	the erm it it
B	it's not that good I wouldn't like say watch it it's just
A	no
B	in the way that it portrays it and I think it's kind of nostalgic
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	The way women used to be treated is better than now	Contradiction
B	I don't remember any of it obviously it was nostalgic of that time
C	yeah
B	and it does make you think how there there are a lot of things that started out there that are very recognisable in our society
C	yeah
B	the way people started to think about things and their values changed and so forth
A	that's interesting
[ANNOTATION]	The way society evolved in the past has affected today	Entailment
B	yeah it was
A	there was a a programme here which I didn't watch a lot of and it it it but it was a police series and it was set in the was it in the seventies? early seventies anyway erm and there there are a couple of women police
B	mm
A	in the office and or in the department and it's
B	I'm listening
A	no
B	I'm just checking the phone
A	no eat your dinner and listen
B	yes mummy
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B will check the phone	Contradiction
A	bad girl erm
A	so the er but similar to what you say absolutely shocking how they spoke to the women and how sexist they were and how erm belittling
B	mm
A	and that it was really really hard and the women of course just took it
B	mm
A	and had no choices about just taking it because that was the environment they chose to come into
[ANNOTATION]	It is important for B to understand the history of women	Entailment
B	yeah exactly
A	was the way that it's sort of put and also how the police treated other people
B	mm
A	like the criminals and whatever you know smacking them and hitting them and you know trying to get a confession out of them thinking that they were doing you know good a service to the public erm it was you know it it wasn't
B	mm mm
C	this is this the one with Martin Shaw the erm he he's the main guy and there's a young assistant
A	yeah
C	is this the one you're talking about? the Geordie one
A	erm
C	cos that's very similar to what you described I don't know whether it's a
A	yes I I think there might be one where it was specifically you know all the cars everything's very authentic
B	yeah
A	it's all back in that time
C	mm
A	that's
C	they were very
B	mm mm
C	that's our decade
A	mm
B	that's your decade even recently there was this thing I don't know if you read about it this woman lawyer so she's on this social media website called Linkedin which is like professional social media
A	oh I've just read it yeah
B	thing so you put your profile but it's not like a social it's a professional thing so you put your CV you put your criteria and the idea is that you can be headhunted or you can connect with other people in your profession and that's the level of how it works you know? so this woman is a young woman in working in as a lawyer and she er somehow got in touch with this partner of one of the law firms in London and sort of middle-aged man probably in his fifties or sixties and erm he wrote her a message on this
C	yeah
B	so she wrote back to him saying this is completely unacceptable behaviour
C	yeah I read that I read that
B	and you know misogynistic and you know this is how men assert their power over women in the workplace by reducing them to the the way that they look instead of their you know
A	mm
B	you know of people responding in different ways some people being extremely rude to her
C	bit over the top really wasn't it?
B	and a lot of women saying good on you wish I could have done that because that's I encounter that kind of prejudice every day in the workplace and especially in the law erm industry where it's all an old boys' club essentially
A	mm
B	and it has been for a long time so you know it's there's some quite and it's like that in Cambridge as well you know that kind of thing is quite acceptable because it's all was a male environment for so long and it's still traditionally they're still
C	gesture
B	I didn't think I mean it seemed a little bit over the top but it's not like in as a single incident you can just brush it off and say whatever you know? the guy was just flirting with this good-looking girl
A	yeah she could have just said don't
B	but the fact that it
A	mm
B	you know and it seems as if like as a woman if you brought it up as and made and issue out of it it's like people'll go you know don't exaggerate
C	right see what you mean
B	but it's an accumulation of those small things you know
A	I know what you mean
B	I do think that it was a good thing to do on her behalf and some people said it was career suicide as well cos she was just never gonna get
A	yeah no
B	anywhere because
A	because no because
B	she's spoken out against the establishment
C	yeah
B	but I mean it's horrible if that's you know if if if one of your male colleagues is even
A	mm
B	in in any way perceiving you in that way an older male colleague who has power over you and has the potential to
C	mm
B	advance your career or not
A	mm
B	to make to make them feel to make you feel as if that is a factor in their decision making at all
A	mm mm that's true
B	is not fair
A	that's true
B	I was on her side
A	put in such terms
B	anyway you know what it's like in social media it always gets bit out of hand
A	oh completely out of control you can't comment on anything
B	there's always these disgusting people as well who are going are just
A	mm say awful things yeah
B	being horrible
A	well you did finally work your way through the dinner and you're not allowed to touch your phone until you're finished
B	what this?
A	you didn't imagine how many times you would moan if people sat in a restaurant and ate and looked at their phone instead of talking to you
B	I don't look at phones in restaurants
A	well this is your dinner what I have made for you
B	sorry mum I agree with you
A	it's the little green bits could have been creased out a bit better
A	and preferably not on the floor
B	sorry I had a bit of a shock cos I poured it in and then I couldn't see
A	no I know what you mean
B	there was all steam in my spectacles
A	very good I enjoyed that
C	mm
A	it's very light even with the potatoes isn't it? and the cheese
C	yes
A	and the saucy stuff it's still a light meal
B	yeah it's nice
C	I don't remember Shell being misogynist really
A	you wouldn't know
B	you wouldn't know
A	you wouldn't have a clue
C	I probably wouldn't have a clue
A	you were very very very bad in
C	I'm sure that it was my perception yeah
B	I'm certain in fact
C	I'm sure that it is
A	and and you personally would say things
C	my my observation my observation is that women that got to the top are quite obnoxious people
A	but that's what you that's what I mean you think they're obnoxious cos they have to be tough
C	because yeah they have to be they have to be hard-nosed and thick-skinned to to get where they got
B	well everyone does
A	everyone does but you don't mind that the men are
C	erm that's an interesting point of view yeah
A	do you? right I'm going to brush my teeth cos I'm in a big hurry
B	I do I mean I'm not saying because I do think the er that women in powerful positions can be are notoriously erm how to say?
B	harder equivalents of their male colleagues
C	that's what I was going to say that they over compensate
B	yeah well I think
C	maybe because they have to
B	maybe maybe or maybe because they have a chip on their shoulder about being a female
C	yeah
B	which is unnecessary but I mean first of all there's just the facts and the figures you know in terms of erm
C	numbers of women in high positions
B	getting paid less and women in high positions you know they just prove that there's discrimination happening because at university it's fifty-fifty so why should it be
C	yeah I see what you mean
B	uneven at that in that type of environment not not to mention politics
C	well the Labour party make a big thing about women being in their party but Mr Corbyn apparently has given all the top jobs to men and then made sure that the total cabinet is half women
B	mm dodgy
C	did you read that?
A	I liked the little joke did you?
B	erm
A	they they they were moaning because he's only given the women the menial jobs
C	the minor the minor jobs
A	so erm so the little er advert in The Times this morning was erm er Corbyn talking to a woman and saying now your goal is to make sure that the erm red flag is nicely ironed
B	yeah exactly well it's better than a kick in the teeth but er
A	only just
B	I do believe there's some way to go
B	the erm
C	did you use any pans my love?
A	I used every pan
A	just in case you were wondering at any stage
B	in Norway you have to have fifty-fifty by law
C	do you?
B	so they did like a
C	okay
B	and er and that's always controversial because it might not be based on merit but eventually it's supposed to sort of you're supposed to sort of break into the convention and then let it trickle down
C	well that of course is the other side of the coin that you have you appoint women because you have to rather than that they have the right credential
B	I know
B	no you've shrunken my jeans
A	and the little leggy thing is tucked in it's not dry only one leggy thing
C	erm yes I'm not sure I'm going get all of these pots in the dishwasher
A	no don't worry just er
B	just put hot water and soap in them and leave them in the sink
B	so er Marriage of Figaro dad sing me a key theme
A	right you've got all your dark wash is washed and dried

A	right an array of socks
A	some of which could be yours
B	is that Marriage of Figaro
A	get clothes on
A	get on with it
B	there's a certain enthusiasm towards the pub visit I've noticed
C	is this after half a day without a glass of wine
A	half a day without the thought of a glass

A	that's entirely dry including the jeans except for the one leg
B	I'll have to breathe in into the jeans
