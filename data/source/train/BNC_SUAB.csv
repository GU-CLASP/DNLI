B	mm
C	er well you know
[ANNOTATION]	the barn is next to the cottage	Entailment

[ANNOTATION]	the hobby is cheap	Contradiction
C	mm
B	mm
C	to do it right
A	mm
C	of the work
C	and he's sort of pushing seventy now actually
[ANNOTATION]	he is young	Contradiction
A	is he?
C	mm
A	wow
C	I think so
C	no they sold the most of the cottages
B	mm
C	but they've um still own the one which was by itself
B	next door to where they live?
C	yeah
B	mm
C	so that's where we'll probably go and stay
B	mm
C	sort of inflation adjusted hasn't really happened
A	yeah which makes it much cheaper than pretty much
C	yeah
A	mm
C	but they don't let it commercially
B	mm
C	I could ring them tonight actually
A	mm
C	find out when it's available
A	you could do
B	I can remember you cheating at playing cards in the
B	in the corner
C	I can remember being falsely accused of cheating in the corner
B	of falsely accused? Or cheating?
A	no no cheating
C	yes
B	cheating is wrong
C	well it's easy when your
A	so you can just make up new rules
C	actually um we are in theory
A	hm
C	um
C	apparently it's similar to whist
B	I used to play it
C	mm
B	oo I don't know what it was in
C	I'm sure oh no it's er cos you used to tell me that you and um you and a friend of yours
B	oh yes but
C	had er like a championship thing
B	mm
C	whist or bridge or? It wouldn't have been poker would it?
B	no it was bridge
A	mm
C	didn't you used to win loads of money doing that?
C	I think that's a yes
C	but um yeah it should be nice
B	oo that that's a long time ago ain't it
C	mm
A	it's heated isn't it?
C	I think so
B	I don't think so
A	mm
C	mm
A	unless they've done it recently
A	yeah
B	mm
C	sushi
C	um
A	mm
B	has it changed much down there?
C	no it's all pretty similar
B	Down at the  down at the  beach I mean
C	oh that's exactly the same
C	um
B	yes
C	well I think they've mostly gone bankrupt
C	um
B	yeah
C	well we went camping um on a campsite right next to the shore
C	I'm not sure how we did that without sinking
C	but we managed it somehow
A	we had a picnic on the shore on the other side
C	and then I sort of swam back
A	mm
C	Wales
A	Wales and use it in the um what's the cove called? The quite sheltered
C	er
A	well yeah
C	um
A	take the dinghy there
C	you have to be careful using
A	Cos you still think er you'd be in danger of er drifting?
C	you'd need to be very careful as to where you went
A	that's what I was thinking
C	well no what we'd all we'd do is we'd make sure we had a lifejacket in it and to be fair I can probably tow it back
A	mm
C	if we had currents
A	in all fairness if we all got in and towed it
C	well can everyone swim?
B	do you want some more tea?
A	um
C	er no thank you
C	that is true
C	about the cheese
A	yeah
A	she can sit in the boat and
A	get towed
C	it's my new ambition like to get her in the water somehow
C	no
C	um
B	hm
C	and they were looking at me slightly oddly
C	I don't think it had occurred to them that it was possible to swim in the lake
A	I was worried about the massive
B	weren't you cold on the?
C	no it was fine
B	mm
C	well it was sort of towards the end of summer
A	are they colder than the sea or warmer?
C	depends which bit of sea
A	mm
C	Cos there's shallower
A	mm
C	oil?
A	no  no the  the coves the the warm water from the Pacific

[ANNOTATION]	Person C had forgotten about the social security	Contradiction
A	school geography? Um
C	do you know what a tectonic plate is?

[ANNOTATION]	Person C is not sure where are Volcanoes really	Neutral
A	yeah I didn't know where the Pacific was
C	yeah so the West Coast of North and South America
A	mhm
C	Alaska
A	mhm
C	and this kind of thing
C	you're learning today
A	well it no it's it's not that I'm not keen to learn things
C	I just don't understand how you could go through life not knowing that
A	hm
C	learning a lot about the Tudors apparently
C	so how were the um so what the Victorians did for us?
A	mm
C	that's easy er
A	it wasn't anything useful
C	so what did you do about the Victorians?
A	lots of stuff about chimney sweeps and um children in Victorian England and things
C	might that have been because you were in a Victorian school?
A	mm
C	yes purely because the other one was doing it
A	mm
C	oh dear
A	yeah we had  we had  Victorian day
C	world War II day
A	world War II day
C	no
A	oh okay
C	ah yes
A	uh-huh
C	this is when you lent me um amongst other things a Spitfire tail wheel
C	flag
B	oh yes
C	yeah
B	did you give them back to me?
C	yes
C	something I've always wondered
B	no
B	and  and I  I remembered it
C	how did you get the tank flag?
B	goodness knows
A	I bet yours were the best artefacts
C	yes
A	for show and tell
C	er cos there was a gas mask as well wasn't there?
C	yeah there was definitely at least one gas mask
B	there was a big flag at the back wasn't there?
C	yeah
B	mm
C	but it was er
C	no it was literally it was meant to be a sort of group exercise
C	what has
A	wow
C	um
C	well it was a yeah it was a red um it was a black swastika in the middle of a red background
B	well what's happened to it now then?
C	you've got it
C	well we gave it back to you
C	um
B	pardon?
C	I'm fairly sure we gave it back to you
B	it's probably on the roof then
C	cool
C	um
A	er anyway
C	what else did?
C	sorry?
B	do you remember how I got hold of it?
C	well you definitely told me it was a tank flag
B	pardon?
C	you definitely told me it was from a tank
B	well yeah
C	in India or
B	in
C	yeah
C	so I can't quite imagine how you got hold of a German flag
C	as in you
B	no I was in
C	oh right
B	mm
C	um
B	I can't er I can't think where I got it from now
C	well did you get it from someone else? Or did you get it from sort of an actual?
B	I can't remember er what it come from
C	no? Um
B	it probably probably came from North Africa
C	yeah I was thinking that
A	mm
B	yeah
C	the most likely bet
C	oh the something interesting I found out the other day
B	mhm
C	probably his tail wheel you've got
A	he wants it back
C	oh
A	who's that?
C	the the guy who refuses to retire
C	yes he's er he's still doggedly teaching
C	it'll be a great shame if he did
C	um
A	do you get lots of stories or is he just good?
C	well no but when you get sort of examples of materials' properties illustrated with stories of dogfights
C	you start to think yes
C	not quite sure how we got onto this
C	um
A	mm
C	um
C	I think you're probably right and they're in your loft
C	it's er come up with a small museum
C	you could open a small museum
C	um
C	world War II
A	I think we had one like that and I took in my mum's ration book
C	yes
A	so in in
B	it went on for a long time after the war
A	mm
C	Cos you know at um at
B	pardon?
C	you know
B	yes
C	er well they've got a er a nineteen forties nineteen fifties prefab there
B	mhm
C	um all over the place
A	so like a quick er kind of houses to replace
C	yeah
A	yeah
B	I mean there were quite er good ones you could build
C	well it's bigger than our house
B	pardon?
C	it's bigger than our house
B	is it?
C	that's the depressing thing
C	I mean admittedly we've got you know a flat screen television which they didn't but
C	and a gas oven
C	but putting that aside they've got it had everything
B	yeah
A	mhm
C	it had a larder
A	I guess they were brand new
C	mm
A	make them kind of up to date
C	yeah
B	mm
C	um
B	no
C	Warminster?
B	pardon?
C	Warminster?
B	no
C	er no I've not no idea
A	mm
C	but um but yeah again that would've been a good thing at the time presumably? Housing wise
B	somewhere just beyond um um tut Stonehenge
C	Chelmsford?
C	um
B	mhm
C	we tried to go to Kielder and failed
C	and they're all
A	mm
C	and there was one there
A	yeah
C	but it closed at lunch-time
C	so we ended up having er a full English breakfast in a a sort of all day English breakfast in a
A	mm
C	café
A	yes
C	Chesters
A	it's the er  the er  the Roman fort
B	Chester?
C	Chesters
B	Chester no?
C	Chesters
A	mhm
C	free
A	yeah
C	so it's quite good cos we can still pretend to be students
C	which makes life cheaper
A	yes
C	Cos do you know how much a cinema ticket costs nowadays? Um it's sort of eight nine pounds
B	goodness gracious
A	yeah
C	whereas if you're a student you can get in for about five or six
B	blimey
C	and it's sort of it's one of those situations where I don't think it's reasonable to pay nearly ten pounds to see
A	it's terrible
C	um it's horrendous
C	yes
C	because um because
C	yes
A	but if
C	well there's a tiny strip
C	see on most student cards in that corner there's a tiny bit of colour
C	um so just there
B	oh yeah?
C	and that's the college colours
B	mhm
C	um
A	so if you you know if you go into the
C	mm

A	ah
B	but er you um  you um  always used to try and cheat didn't you?
C	you always used to say I was cheating

A	I think silver goes quite nicely cos we've got the silver
C	Silver curtains
C	I was saying that we've got that lamp in our living room
C	except it's in silver not black
A	mm
C	so it matches our curtains
C	yes um er when we moved in we had er after a week living there we had both er both sets of our mothers sewing curtains
C	they had a little production line
C	uh
A	well we had you and your dad doing all the DIY
C	mhm
A	and my dad and your mum doing curtains
C	and your dad sort of keeping out the way

B	mm
C	mm
C	mm
B	mm
A	that's the difference
C	eight
A	eight miles out
C	no seven
B	there isn't much accommodation in
C	well
A	um
C	well there's tons but there's
A	mm
C	also a huge demand for it
B	mm
A	so it's all very expensive
C	um cos there's two universities there
A	so they can charge
B	mm
A	ridiculous amounts for not
C	mm
A	mm
B	when I was
A	wow
C	A long way past
A	yeah
C	well it's now linked up to what would have been separate villages
A	mm
C	um would probably have been a few miles away from Cambridge
B	mhm
C	um actually have you got a map? We can have a look at it after lunch
A	mm
C	mm
A	and now it's just North Cambridge
C	but um yes bottom line um buying rather than renting definitely the way to go
A	mm
C	um
A	no we're er we're very pleased with it
C	mm
A	mm
C	and we've started cooking roast dinners
C	which is a skill in itself
C	um
C	um
A	but yeah this weekend we've got a friend coming round and we have to do it ourselves
C	there's a hospital near us right?
B	well you used to help me cook didn't you?
C	er yeah I can cook
A	mm
C	I just never
C	anything where you're cooking over a period of more than three hours
C	is er
A	I think it's er it's not the actual like skill it's the timing that's hard
C	mm
A	otherwise you'd end up with a burnt bit and a uncooked bit
C	yeah
B	mm
C	yeah
A	do you want some mango? Er it's not  it's not
B	um no thank you
C	are you sure?
B	oh alright

C	in various forms
C	that's a good reaction
B	nobody's done it for a long time though
C	yeah
C	no exactly
B	mm
C	er
B	I can remember the first swimming
C	it was in nineteen eleven
A	the first swim you did?
B	mm
C	oh I did
C	the first
B	pardon?
C	it was in Luton I think
C	probably
A	mm

A	yeah
C	mm
A	yeah
C	they also got one up on the Ordnance Survey
A	it's a nice hill
C	mm
C	I say good to run up
C	but um
A	mm
A	so yeah so I'm I'm training for that
C	something in that ballpark
A	mm
C	um
B	well
C	um no it it well it uses er half radar half um tut tu tu tu tu a um it's got an er it's got a camera er like a video camera
B	mm
C	and it has image processing
A	so the bonnet pops up and then it
C	mm
A	comes out
B	and the same if you get too close to a car
C	yeah
A	mhm
C	um
A	how's it?
C	only then it doesn't use the airbag it just brakes
B	what happens to the bloke behind you?
C	mm
B	mm
A	well there'll probably be videos of it
C	yeah
A	Cos don't they do like crash test
C	yes
A	videos? So there'll probably be one of this airbag
C	mm
A	mm
C	so you're not going anywhere anyway
