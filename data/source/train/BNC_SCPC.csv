A	it's a bit low
D	it's
A	halfway through the journey
D	mm well earlier than that
A	oh right
A	yeah
D	and I I think I've made a mistake by putting
A	oh washing up liquid?
D	and er it's frothing up a bit yeah
A	oh
D	I don't think that's
A	a good enough
D	a good thing really
A	right I think
D	yeah
D	mm
A	new pot so I'll have a
D	oh right so I pulled up that caf√© as I think in the boot there's a bottle of water

D	but on the
A	yeah mum said it's
D	misty and that innit?
A	yeah well
D	mm
A	mm
D	than ever now
D	I decided to bring it been in but
A	oh
D	and there's him two doors away particularly if it's a Friday
A	yeah
D	and they have two cars
A	mm
D	now that he or she will get parked there and it's there by Monday or
A	oh mm
D	if they're on holiday and that
A	could be for the
D	all week mm?
A	not very convenient

D	it's clear
A	yeah
D	come now
D	I'll go to post office come back and she's in
A	it's gone yeah
D	now doesn't bother me at all and I just open the gates and come in
A	yes
D	and I can turn round
A	mm
D	and I sort of back in the drive a bit
A	mm
D	and I'll drive straight out
A	yeah
D	I know she's not gonna be there all that long
A	no
D	so I can get parked up again
A	mm
D	but it's basically to keep other people out
A	yeah
D	but oh that
C	mm it does mm
D	and being under that tree
A	yeah
D	the birds perch up there
A	mm which has certain consequences
D	and then of course spring time
A	yeah
D	they do all that
A	that's right
D	and autumn
A	mm
D	all the leaves on it
A	mm
D	mm
A	mm it is
C	how was your day
A	fine yes yes
C	yeah
A	alright
C	mm
A	without consequence
C	mm yes
A	quite hard to find something that you think'll be alright but
C	mm good
D	well you looked in er went in Waitrose yesterday wasn't it?
C	mm
D	and there wasn't the selection that there was before was there?
C	no
A	oh right
D	mm
C	you know in the
D	mind you having said that
C	yeah
D	there's one or two empty
A	right
D	yeah
A	bit low on stock
D	yeah
C	oh
D	where I think
C	mm
D	things would have been
A	mm
D	I do
A	might have been they're waiting for a delivery do you think?
D	mm
C	mm yes
A	mm
C	mind you when we were coming along erm past Morrisons there was an Asda van came out of
A	oh right
C	there you know one of those
D	mm
C	massive
D	up the slip road
A	mm well they get
D	well the only thing down there where they would go
A	oh right
D	is really er the empty shops you know them empty ones big ones
A	yeah
D	now whether
A	they're going to have that one there
D	they're moving in there and it just back of my mind I think in my enquiries well some time ago
A	mm
D	one of them was Asda
A	oh right
D	and the other one
C	Morrisons won't like that will they?
A	no
D	the other one was a Mcdonald's a drive-through
A	oh right
D	but there was some planning hitch on the drive-through
A	right
D	it
A	I see
D	and really it's bad enough getting out of there now
A	mm
D	onto the slip out of the car park
D	onto the slip road
A	mm
D	er to get onto the main road
A	mm
D	now that's with er like Morrisons there and then of course we've got a Marks there
A	mm
D	and then there's Argos there
A	mm
D	and someone else there a furniture place I think
A	mm
D	and they're not attracting a lot of customers with cars are they? cos you see
A	no
D	people going there have to be in a car really
A	oh yeah they do
D	but then you've got the
A	right
D	place
A	yes
D	er there's very often people there plus some of their big trucks outside
A	mm
D	so it's bad enough now so when we get more cars coming in because of new shops
A	yes it won't help will it?
B	it's gonna be a job getting out of there
A	mm it gets gridlocked doesn't it?
C	mm
D	mm
D	you see and another big attraction now is Morrisons has the petrol
A	true
D	and they come in that's another influx of er vehicles
C	are you well
B	fine thank you grandma
C	good yeah so
A	yeah
B	yes
C	mm it's gone anyway
A	bit better
D	look smart this morning
B	do I do
D	look smart well turned out
A	mm
D	you see I've followed suit a bit
A	yes you've got a similar type of jumper on
B	indeed
D	well
C	yeah
A	I think
B	five
A	five weeks of lectures left haven't you?
B	yes that's right
A	incredible
D	so you've five weeks to do?
A	of lectures
D	yes
A	and then I think he's got about a month to revise
D	mm
B	and ten weeks
A	ten weeks you've
B	yes each semester is ten weeks
A	oh yes but you've got five weeks of lectures
B	five weeks of lectures
A	yes
B	and then after the five weeks of lectures ten weeks before they they'll send well the
A	so you've got ten weeks?
C	oh
B	I'll
A	so ten weeks there's no lectures?
B	ten
A	good heavens
A	how is that
D	can he handle it?
D	can you handle it
A	we'll have to try our best won't we?
D	will you manage?
C	yeah
D	you'll have to pull all the stops out
D	yeah
A	it seems a waste of time with
D	mm
A	all those people in accommodation paying
C	yes
A	how much a week and they're not
C	yeah
A	don't really need to be there then do they?
D	that's a good point you make really
A	I have a very good point
D	I know
D	you heard a funny this morning didn't you
C	what?
D	on the wireless
C	oh yes
A	mm
A	mm
C	so she said to
C	yes
A	and go to bed late yeah
C	yeah
D	mm
A	yeah
C	sounded like it was quite funny
A	mm
B	mm
D	first time we've heard it
C	yes please I will
A	yeah
C	thank you
B	well I do have one piece of classwork to do for the twentieth of April
C	oh right
B	erm about the
C	oh yes
B	then I would have three
B	er those to sit
C	three?
B	three yes
C	at the end of that ten weeks?
B	yes
C	yeah I see
A	and are they those really long ones?
B	erm
A	those three-hour ones?
B	I think they're yes I think there is one three-hour one two-hour and one one-hour I think
B	or is it one three and three
D	there's enough then?
B	but
C	mm
B	yes
C	mm
B	I'm not sure how well spread out they will be across the two week er then period
C	no it could be bunched
B	yes they were
B	just a little bit bunched
A	mm
B	in January but
A	and there was a Saturday morning one
B	yes
C	yes there was
A	yeah
D	you can do it
A	mm feel alright don't you?
B	yeah
D	even grandma er was in er
C	mm
D	and it is er er it looks as though they've never been used don't it
C	mm
A	there's a lot of textbooks like
C	well that's fifty pence each if he didn't want them he can just
D	and yeah of course
A	no
C	get rid of them
D	really it they're like the A level and AS
C	oh right yeah
B	business erm er business studies
A	oh yes
D	or something
A	oh right
D	so I said
C	see what they're like
D	just er
A	yeah
D	and I've also brought that piece of the
C	mm
D	and the story that is attached to that
C	mm
D	not that I got a mention
A	oh they missed the
D	but you see it was the girls and er I remember mm sat on this wall
A	mm
D	that er when er he'd met me on the stairs
A	yeah
D	and he said oh you've got your report then
A	mm
D	these stairs was concrete steps coming down from
A	mm
D	the one above like and and er says have a look
A	mm
D	you know no no I
A	mm
D	cos it was boys at this end and girls at that although it was all one building
A	mm
D	it was all one building and across the playground were the big high wall the size of that brick wall that separated there was no girls or boys mixed at at anywhere er and er and so now then evidently er some of the English books and that from the girls' side have been have surfaced
C	yes
D	with
C	I wonder where they were then
A	mm
C	all this time
D	and they were ten and eleven-year-old weren't they? and according to the write up
C	mm
D	it's saying that er the government or somebody
D	like asked schools to write get them to write about what they thought of the bombing the you know
A	yeah
D	the raids and it's these are some of the little
A	mm
D	essays that they've they've done complete with blots and
C	mm
D	teachers' marks
C	mm
D	and now they've been sort of put in plastic envelopes and and they're on show at the er history museum or something like that and I just had a moment I thought
D	and then the roof went
D	they had no idea mm
A	mm
D	it was like a cloth
A	vellum you mean?
D	no not
D	vellum no wasn't the Magna
C	a type of fabric wasn't it?
D	mm yes it had like
D	linen in it a linen thing mm er but when I got my new report it were just half the size
A	mm
D	and it was like yellow stiff backed stiff cardboard that and you know and but much better
C	yes that's the main thing
D	that's the one I've got to find
C	mm mm
D	of course that won't surface will it?
A	what?
D	it's the other one that will do it
A	mm
B	mm
D	but when I were when I read that I thought what a thing to write about why not write about them gifts coming from America?
A	exactly
D	you know the sweets and that
A	much more
D	and how
A	interesting
D	and I can remember thinking how I this is something worth writing about is this
A	yes getting somewhere now
D	yes
A	mm
D	this worthwhile and I
A	mm
D	but they didn't get that across enough and er and then the headmaster
A	mm
C	I think your best line was if you've any more spare you know
D	yeah
C	they had to send them
D	send them
A	yes
D	yeah
D	send them
A	the
D	the monkey nut ones they
A	mm
D	were very good
A	yes
C	mm think so yeah
B	yes
D	have you have you received a letter from us? er no I didn't know whether they was saying about you know the
C	yes
D	er not quite true really but you see this last letter I wrote put in yours in as well attached please refer to the earlier letter like which is what you've done probably er er we've put it to the accounts manager and they've got hold of it and well she said she said that er we've we've sent a letter to you with er you know with some various packages on them and er we're sure that you will like some of those like and er and so I'm expecting when we get back along today like they'll have
D	that they
D	so that brought it to his attention
C	orchestra
D	mm
B	well erm we changed our electricity and gas plan
C	have you?
B	again yes
D	again?
C	oh right
B	yes
D	yeah?
C	is it with the same firm or
B	yes
C	with a different firm?
B	it's the same firm
C	yes
B	yes so they'll
C	oh right
B	bring out a new short-term fix with the no exit fee each month
C	oh right
B	and so
C	yeah
B	we
D	so they wanted to
B	a quick look each month
D	yes
C	yeah
D	mm
B	to change
C	oh that's good
C	mm
B	er mm
D	you see that's another thing you go into these things but to get out you've a penalty to pay
C	mm
B	yes
C	mm that's good then
B	but that is our sort of new strategy is to do short term fixes with no penalty
A	mm
C	mm
B	to
C	well
B	withdraw
D	yeah it makes sense
C	I don't know all these
D	cos I say
D	it out loud so you pick it up you see
C	yeah and then it's
D	they're
C	ain't it one of them
D	you realise that I'm sure
C	mm
D	er er I said but I said
C	but I don't think this letter ever was sent
[ANNOTATION]	the letter has not been sent	Entailment
A	no well they'll sounds like they knew it wasn't or they wouldn't have
C	mm
A	asked you would they?
C	no
D	no
A	mm
D	no
[ANNOTATION]	they did not ask speaker D	Entailment
B	but with most things you do need to look at them each year whether it's
D	that's right
B	car insurance home insurance
C	yeah
D	exactly
B	energy
D	mm
C	mm
B	erm
D	yeah
B	broadband and telephones
[ANNOTATION]	insurance is more expensive than broadband	Neutral
D	mm
C	mm
D	mm and and and it's true mm
B	mm
D	and you can save this here that in fact
[ANNOTATION]	the insurance is saved	Neutral
B	mm
D	so I
A	yeah
D	anyhow
A	he's at your leeks
D	she said
A	that squirrel
D	the thing is
[ANNOTATION]	the squirrel is at the leeks	Entailment
A	yes we're watching you
C	yes you little rascal
A	not bothered?
C	no
D	yeah she said some people leave it far too late it's the last thing they get thinking about where you're going to get your money from
B	mm
[ANNOTATION]	the money will come late	Neutral
D	and they get it from the airports
B	mm
D	so she said er but
B	mm
D	so she said looking at it that way she said I have a glass of wine or maybe two free
A	yes
D	for getting my er
A	yeah
D	but if they've got it somewhere else they could get a hundred and forty which means I can have a glass of champagne
C	mm
D	instead of wine and a burger
B	mm mm
D	free
C	mm
D	just be getting it there
C	mm
D	and she said people as you say you know looking around at these er offers
B	yes
D	shall we call them? er
A	mm is one of the worst
D	was
A	places isn't it?
D	yeah was the worst place to get it mm
A	well they know that you need it
C	mm
D	exactly
A	and there's nowhere
D	yeah
A	else to go now
D	this is
A	so
C	yeah that is it
D	that er it
A	they've got
D	there's
A	yeah
D	setting in now isn't there?
A	that's it
D	yeah just get them it doesn't matter
B	mm
A	that's it
D	but I mean some people that's just for a hundred pound but people'll get five six a thousand pound changed don't they?
B	they do
D	but if you're gonna get er a hundred and thirty I think it was from the bank
B	yes
D	as well you know
B	mm
D	but it's just at this time er the way things are at this particular moment in time that it's er a hundred and thirty euros to a pound
B	mm
D	cos I thought well at that time really? you know anybody with any money to spare they could get the euros now
B	mm
D	just keep them until er
B	it has
C	mm
B	yes
D	I see you've got Greece colours up there
B	yes
D	er have got him conditioned and that to er
B	mm
D	so there could be trouble on the streets again
B	mm
D	of course our
B	yes
D	they went this morning
B	mm well how how frequently do they go? I so I thought they went at Christmas
D	they did
D	yes
B	that's
D	they came back
D	they came back just after Boxing well they came back on the twenty-ninth of December
B	yes
D	and they're on their way again for ten I mean er ten days I think or fourteen day but that's what they go for
B	mm mm
D	well in fact how it worked
D	and he's just shouted through I've got a good one here
B	mm
D	they are there they are
B	mm
D	I think they're both from er
B	yes
A	mm
B	uhu
D	so
B	mm
A	would you like to see my hats?
D	yes I would
A	yeah
D	uhu
A	I've made five of them now
D	five? it's all done by Easter then
A	yeah
D	wow
A	okay
D	pity didn't show the picture of the er
A	that's the best bit
D	I mean we never got to write anything you know to do anything like that not that I remember anyhow
C	so would you prefer to get your information from a book or from your television your computer?
B	erm
D	you get it where you can I think don't you?
C	yeah
B	it's
D	you're doing it in
B	probably going towards more the books because
C	yeah
B	of the sort of
C	source of
B	erm obviously you want it
C	information
B	to be reliable and so that's that's what they're looking for
C	yeah
B	but probably increasingly it's erm online journals as well
C	is it?
B	yes
C	oh right
D	you see what he would need as well but probably like references
C	yeah that's what it is yeah
A	oh you do yeah
D	you know who done it and
C	yes
A	mm mm
D	whatever sometimes you don't just quite get it off the television in a way or catch it
B	mm but
C	mm
B	you can't really get something off a an unknown website and reference that it's
D	mm
B	not very good
C	no no it you have to get
B	I mean but er still like learning how to do something in mathematics websites can be quite helpful
D	yes it it's more er as you say academically er accepted if it's a book
B	mm
D	with all of the
B	or journal yes
C	mm
B	journals you get you get a big one
C	mm
D	well I've er I've read a book of er it's the bomb Churchill's Bomb they called it
B	mm
D	and it's a thick book ain't it
D	and I've read it and it was quite interesting really because er er in our day Churchill was well cometh the man cometh the moment and it was Churchill if it hadn't have been for Churchill we would not er have been on the winning side of the war
B	mm
D	and if it hadn't have been for Churchill talking to er Roosevelt and getting him to get America
D	to help us
B	mm
D	to
C	yes
D	attack Germany you know
B	yes
D	the D-Day landings and all that business er and if they hadn't have succeeded
B	mm
D	and we would have never have been able to have done that er invasion
A	mm
A	the punchline yeah wasn't it?
D	yes he could always come out with things like that
B	mm
D	er and er
B	mm
D	and it's it's there like you know what happened and that and er but what I'm getting to
A	mm
D	of references of where it's from and who's it
A	yeah
D	you know what a thing I thought I was a lot more to read but I did I'd come to the end
A	yeah
D	but it's amazing how many people had
A	mm
D	contributed to that
A	it's very detailed
D	you know the Bodleian library
A	yeah
D	the Ashmolean and
A	mm
A	mm
B	well referencing is possibly not as simple as some might think
A	mm
D	mm
B	because there are different styles of referencing
C	oh is there?
B	erm I've had to sort of adhere to the Harvard style of referencing
C	oh right
B	but er but there are other styles as well and
A	you know that girl I was talking to while I was waiting for you
B	yes
A	to come? she was doing English and politics
B	yes
A	and she said I think it was in the English they had to do the Harvard referencing
B	yes
A	and in the politics they've got to do Chicago referencing
B	yes it's different for departments yes
A	well you'd think they'd just have one style for the whole university to make it simpler wouldn't you?
B	oh
A	why is it different?
D	cos they don't like doing things simple I think
B	I their reason is that they try to choose what most people would academics would write
A	in that circle?
B	yes
A	yeah oh I see
B	some departments even have more than one style of of
A	oh
B	er er referencing and specify that
A	mm
B	erm each different essay that they're given
C	so
B	erm
A	well it's a style of the referencing
B	the style of referencing
C	oh reference
B	so one
B	can be in text reference so it's
C	mm
B	one particular style is that there's a little number that they've above
C	oh yeah yeah
B	what somebody's said
C	yes
B	erm another way could be that in the text there's a bracket with the name of the author a comma and then the date that book
C	yeah
B	was published
C	yeah
B	and then so that's having the text one could vary
C	yeah
B	at the back of the book you probably don't realise but there are actually different styles for example what do you actually include in a reference?
C	yeah
B	so usually there's a minimum the author title is included but also if it's a journal you've got the title of the journal now which journal it's from
C	yeah
B	so it could be titled er
C	oh
B	erm
B	the Journal for Management or something
C	oh
B	something like that and then you might have to give what er volume and the edition the journal is
C	oh yes
B	but that's usually given sort of about a year it would be fourteen and then in brackets which month of the
C	mm
B	and in other styles there it can be something called the a doi DOI
C	mm
B	and that's like a special number that if you type that in you get the page up with
C	oh
B	a lot of information of the book
C	oh
B	erm and some er DISBN as well
A	mm
C	and you've got to put the title of the book in italics
B	yes well that
D	oh yeah
B	varies as well
A	oh right you might or you might not
B	yes and obviously
C	mm
B	there's a set rule generally there should be a set rule for each different style and if you get that slightly incorrect to be penalised in a an essay so
A	quite severely
C	mm
D	it's about er artwork as well by the sound of it
A	mm
D	quite severely?
A	very severely I would say
C	mm
D	yeah
C	I know what you mean with those little erm letters and that cos
B	yeah
C	er erm you when my my history reading
A	mm
C	erm you know they do that and then put it at the bottom of the page
D	and you haven't really got to the subject yet have you then?
B	no
A	worth a lot of marks that
B	mm
A	I think a disproportionate amount of marks
B	mm
C	mm
A	because it's not to do with how you've argued
B	no
A	the case
B	no
A	it's just a technical issue
D	it's er unnecessary as well isn't it really to have that you know
B	and obviously little things like er it being in italics can
D	mm
B	to lose
C	yeah
B	a lot of marks
A	mm
D	but
C	thank you
D	this is what do they call it? the discipline that you have to er adhere to see to see if you can can do that and and it's like the taxi driver
C	sorry
D	but only those who can do it er would succeed like you know they don't if everybody
C	mm
B	but it would be quite easy to lose ten percent of the marks
D	yeah
B	just
C	yes
B	for one mistake or it's
D	oh is much as that?
B	yes
D	well that's a that is unfair is that
C	mm
B	and there's a disagreement to what means
D	oh yes
B	yeah so now I don't think it does a couple
C	no
B	is two
C	yes
B	and a few is three
C	three or
B	mm
C	more yeah
B	that's
C	mm
D	but you'd have to go along with them wouldn't you?
B	mm
C	yes I agree yeah yeah
D	yeah tell them what they want to hear or
C	mm
D	put down what they want to read sort of thing
B	mm
C	so are you
B	style it is
C	style it is?
B	happily with the management school it was
C	yeah
B	it's always Harvard
C	oh right
B	but that's
C	yeah
A	mm
B	it can get quite tricky for things like er one thing that tends to happen now is dictionaries tend to only be online now I I think Oxford er University Press don't seem to publish
A	a new one
B	the specialist dictionaries
C	oh
B	out as much you know like a
C	oh
B	a dictionary for finance or something
C	no
B	like that
A	oh right
B	so to get the most up to date one
C	you need to be online
B	which is
C	no
B	don't get page numbers on an online
C	yeah
B	dictionary
C	mm
B	though
C	oh
A	oh I see
B	and I don't think Harvard well I don't know the sort of referencing styles have sort of come up to speed with that
A	no
B	cos the big part of the university is referencing
A	mm
B	and I've got to do a
D	mm
B	what's called a an academic integrity test which is purely about referencing and
D	yeah
B	that type of but then I think one reason is they're very worried that you'd copy somebody else's idea without acknowledging it or
C	oh and that yeah
B	taking into account somebody else's idea
C	yes
B	without
D	mm
B	acknowledging
C	well I suppose with these reference books you know like the you say the Oxford things change so quickly now
B	yes
C	don't they?
B	they do
C	so erm you know they're they'll print one and then it's out of print
B	yes
C	out of erm date isn't it?
B	it is
C	and if you
B	and that's one of the good thing about the online one is
C	mm
B	it's usually the dictionary's dates are twenty fifteen or twenty-fourteen
C	yeah
B	so it's very up to date
A	yeah
D	and you can't get purchase those though that take a dictionary then?
B	well you you don't
D	mm
B	book as
C	no
B	such it's I mean it's they're very easy to use the online dictionaries
C	yeah
D	mm
B	I like them
C	yeah
B	I I think
D	well perhaps
B	yes
D	er very much so with the computer or what it what you can get out of it
B	mm it's
A	mm
B	well print one good thing is you can type in to the dictionary what word you're looking for and then it's
C	yeah
B	comes up straight away
C	yeah
C	without going through the pages
B	yes
C	looking for it
B	and in different dictionaries it's not just the journal of of of the dictionary of finance it could be the dictionary of management or something
C	yeah
B	like that they're just like
C	mm
B	variations according to the specialist area it's focussing on
C	mm
D	that's what I say he's very er adept to it you know
B	well
C	cos I don't suppose everybody is
B	no it it's it's it's very variable really
C	yes I think so
B	and possibly variable on certain things like some people are in regards sort of computers and phones either very orientated to sort stuff er maybe like Facebook and
A	oh
B	that type of thing are experts at doing that but
C	yeah
B	not sort of at certain other things
C	no
B	mm
C	no I can imagine
B	one thing that I have been doing is erm is using a software called SPSS which is erm a statistical software to do the different types of texts and
C	oh yeah
B	erm using processing data and that type of thing
C	oh right mm
B	mm
D	you're getting above us er
B	uhu yes
D	because
A	printer right
D	I got so far
D	got so far and although I did it here
B	yes
D	and I said I've got it I've got it
B	oh right
D	and tried it it didn't so I I've tried some other things and it that is it isn't no now I was gonna bring it back today actually but I thought no no you've been up all and that and and I can print off on the other one
B	yes
D	it's going alright like but er I thought really grandma's right I'll have to do it when you do it I'll have to write something down so
B	yes
D	how many stages there are and do it
B	mm the other option is is that I take a picture of each of the stages and then put a full explanation underneath saying exactly what you're looking for
D	the thing is
B	yes
D	er but it's in German or or Spanish or something
B	mm
D	but I can't find my English one
C	mm mm
B	I've erm bought a a new er cartridge for my printer
D	oh yeah
B	yes so
D	uhu
B	haven't been they seem to sort of risen in price a little bit but er I managed to get one for what I was sort of hoping to
D	mm
B	get it for
D	was that
B	yes it was
D	mm mm mm
B	it tends to be most of the inks I tend to buy are possibly old stock from erm a business that no longer has that printer or something like that
D	yeah yeah they've updated
B	and they just want to
D	mm
B	get rid of it really
D	yeah that's it and sell it off mm I mean I remember er our accountant and er a really nice bloke he was and I got on well with him er
B	mm
D	well he was going through the stores to the stock
D	and they went through all this and a lot of it was put into the
B	renewed
D	er renewed
B	mm
D	and
C	than you
D	they then had to be er reported
C	mm
D	to see why you know was they doing something and that was the accountant
B	mm
D	really in in in er which were no good you know it were went into a few thousand pound that had anyhow they got hold of that and then
C	what's that
A	sweet potato soup
C	oh right
A	we like custard no
D	I'll tell you what er
A	oh right
D	we got this week from Lloyds
A	oh
D	put it over
A	a contactless card
C	mm
D	contactless mm
A	mm
D	and that where you didn't need your pin and that or or or
A	dicey
D	well mm you know as though somebody else could get in and just contact it you know
A	yeah
D	and unless you've got to some security on it
A	mm
D	I mean I've seen them on the er television going through the turnstiles on the underground and they're just
A	yeah
D	is it an Oyster card or something?
A	yeah
D	they just sort of just put it over and go through don't they?
A	mm
B	they can I can now actually
D	could be
B	I can you can use erm a contactless debit or credit card
C	mm
B	or in
D	mm
B	gone in there it's
C	uhu
D	I don't think they'll put us on it do you
C	no I don't
B	mm I don't I had any choice with mine it's has to be contactless
D	does it?
C	does it really?
B	yes
A	is it? but have you used it?
B	well I tried to do it contactless once but it wouldn't let me because
A	oh right oh
B	er
C	mm mm do you need to activate it or something?
B	well it will ask you for your pin number sometimes
D	mm
B	it's a random thing
A	yeah
D	mm
A	check
B	mm a check but
A	mm I see
B	but they are trying to lift the amount from twenty pounds to thirty pounds
C	mm
B	that out using that you can do contactless
C	that's only a small amount is it?
B	yes it's limited to
C	oh I see I didn't know that
A	mm is it just for small things like coffee and newspapers
B	yes
A	and magazines and that?
B	yes it's
A	mm
B	as I say that it's currently a limit of twenty pounds but now it's down to up to thirty pounds
A	that's considered small change now is it? people
A	mm
B	I don't think it's intended to use if you're buying a television or
D	no
B	something it's
C	no
B	just for little
A	mm
B	everyday expenses
C	mm
D	oh we did get our cheque again didn't we
C	mm
D	went back to the bank
B	yes
D	for our pensioner bonds
B	yes
D	and er
B	mm
D	or or or a
B	mm
D	he said another cheque as well I just forget like what it was banker's cheque and then a
C	banker's draft
D	a draft or something
B	mm
C	mm
D	he said really he says therefore
D	therefore
D	say you was buying a car
B	uhu yes
D	from a dealer twenty-five thousand thank you say twenty-five thousand pounds or something
B	thank you yes
D	but
B	mm
D	er and so when you give the car dealer
B	mm
D	so we filled these in again that and they've come back again haven't they?
B	the VW garage does now allow either you couldn't
C	oh
A	oh
B	has to be via debit card
C	oh
D	and that's that was the example our bank man gave
B	mm
D	a car
C	what a great big sandwich
A	huge
D	what did you think to that little article?
A	mm interesting isn't it?
D	mm
A	mm doesn't say where they found them rather crucially does it?
C	no
D	no
C	or where they've been all
D	well that's it as far as I remember it was this end of the school which was the boys' end
A	mm
D	which was
A	could have been one of the teachers took them home and
C	mm
A	they've died and been found
C	mm
A	in their possessions or
C	mm
A	something
C	you don't know
A	there's part of the story
D	I don't know
A	missing
C	mm
D	took them home for marking
C	mm
A	some people are like that with marking and it takes weeks to get them back
D	mm
B	yeah
D	is there an instruction book on it?
B	yeah there is yes
D	yeah mm for cleaning?
B	well not for cleaning but basically
D	yeah
B	they say don't do anything unless there's
D	mm
B	somebody in there that
D	mm
B	as far as I'm aware once you open it there's a little pipe that's connected to that end who can just sort of lift it off and then just clean it like that
A	I think on Pancake Day I'm going to use the rice milk as the liquid and still put an egg in it
A	I tried it with the egg replacement but it's not very good
C	what was that dried egg?
A	mm
C	like a dried egg?
A	it wasn't it was a dried product but it wasn't egg
C	oh right
A	I think and then I
C	oh I see yeah
A	there's some
B	very
A	substitute
D	mm
B	very hard to
A	it looked terrible
C	mm
A	I've decided not only can you not make an omelette without breaking eggs you can't make a pancake either
A	yeah
C	I noticed in er Morrisons they had some packs of already made pancakes
A	mm just to reheat mm
C	mm
A	well I'll only be getting a third of an egg
C	mm
A	so
C	mm
A	it might be too much I don't know
C	actually I
D	so
C	I think you can
A	mm
D	how far into the test are you now?
A	erm eight weeks
D	out
A	out of twelve
D	uhu
A	so two thirds
D	mm
A	I think it's going pretty well really I've adapted to most of the things
D	mm mm probably mm
A	try things and see whether
A	I get a reaction
C	mm
A	I think it will have to be very gingerly
C	mm
A	erm
C	yeah
A	and some of the things you'll decide no it's still not alright so
C	mm
A	I'll have to be kicked into touch for another
D	so
A	indefinitely really
D	when when did it come on
A	I don't know really certainly in years it is I think
D	in
A	in terms of years it is
D	in years?
A	mm
D	mm
A	mm
D	uhu
A	saying to I was talking to er well somebody I know let's just say that
D	mm?
A	who has a daughter in the year below
B	it is
A	two years younger than you
D	no
A	they live at
D	where is it?
A	said it's eight miles drive country roads to the main road
D	oh crumbs mm
A	she's got a a car about ten or twelve years old
D	oh and the tracks there'll be tracks not roads be terrible in winter and that
A	obviously don't get gritted
D	mm
A	had a bit of snow last week she said I woke up cos she has to take her daughter to school to the train station rather for eight o'clock
A	to
D	mm
A	for eight o'clock
D	yeah
A	think it would be would it be about a half-hour drive?
B	well the the problem is if it's won't be able to pick up much speed so whilst it's probably maybe twelve miles
C	mm
B	it will be
A	maybe twenty minutes even yeah
B	at least twenty-five minutes yeah
A	I think that's too early to get them to the train station
D	it is
A	for eight o'clock when you've that drive
B	I know
A	on country roads woke up it had snowed she said I had a migraine the minute I woke up
D	mm
A	I said that is just what happens to me as soon as I wake up I know this day is not going to be
D	mm
A	alright
C	mm
A	and
D	so really anxiety brought that on with the the realising
B	mm
A	so well I wondered whether it was the food intolerance actually the same as me
D	mm
A	soon as you wake up
A	you know whereas when you went to bed you're maybe not so bad but something has happened in the night and I think it's the digestion process has got
D	yeah because of anxiety maybe
A	trying to work on it yeah
D	mm mm I mean
A	and it's gone wrong
D	I always say that don't I? your stomach is like another like another brain
C	sensing
D	really
A	yes
D	yeah very sensitive I mean
A	yeah
D	it's butterflies in your stomach
C	yeah and nausea yes
D	it's that that you feel it's not there really
A	no
D	and yet it is up there but somehow
A	it's all connected
D	mm
A	isn't it?
D	mm
A	so she said to
D	mm
A	I'm not I can't do it
D	mm
A	so she said we knew that we're going to miss the train now
D	mm settle for it
A	so she said we waited half an hour and started to feel a bit better I don't know what tablets she oh I think she has the Migrelief tablets doesn't she?
B	mm
A	that I used to have
D	do you recognise them
A	yes
D	mm
A	so they set off she said I was only doing about twenty miles an hour cos I was really scared the roads are really bad
D	mm
A	and we got to the bridge and she erm lost control of the car it skidded on the ice and crashed into a farmer's fence
D	mm
A	the exhaust separated from the car
D	mm
A	so they were grounded
D	so they
A	they were grounded
D	oh
A	they couldn't move
D	mm
A	so she was trying to
D	cos it might have been partly in like in a ditch you know
A	yeah
D	that type of thing
A	at an
D	mm
A	at an angle
D	mm
A	couldn't move it so she had to wait for a farmer to come with a tractor to er
A	pull her out
D	mm
A	and then somebody else came along in a car and they put the daughter in the car to take her to
D	to
A	and she er tried to get the farmer to pull the car out of that position and then he took her back to her house to ring the garage
D	he towed it back for her?
A	no they just pulled it straight
D	mm
A	but he took her back home but they left the car
D	oh to the garage to go get it mm
A	then they rang the garage to erm bring the trailer
D	mm
A	or whatever
D	mm
A	to do that and then the next day she got a letter from the farmer saying
D	er
A	he wanted three hundred pounds to mend the fence
D	it's it's no wonder you know
A	you got a migraine
D	yeah
C	and then there's the
D	you can
C	car to repair
D	it's a wonder you don't
A	yeah
D	have a complete nervous breakdown isn't it?
D	mm
C	really
D	and
C	she shouldn't have gone out in the first place should she but then you don't know do you?
D	and what about another fifty say or a hundred for trespassing?
A	oh yeah
D	mm
D	trespass oh mm
C	well he soon got that off didn't he?
A	yeah
C	mm
D	mm
C	yeah
A	then there's the bill to mend the car
D	yeah that would be something and is it worth mending anyhow?
A	no not really well it's ten slash
D	mm
A	becomes a point where it's not really
D	mm mm
A	economical but there again if you don't haven't got anything
D	you aren't gonna get a bottle of milk mm
A	then she said do you know I said to my husband I never wanted to buy this house in the first place
D	mm
A	why can't we live somewhere sensible?
D	yeah
C	oh
A	so they had that row
D	why do they live there?
D	why do they live there?
D	if they're not farmers then or anything?
A	no he used to work at
D	ah well that then
A	does that explain shall I just
D	say no more
A	stop there?
D	say not more
A	stop there
A	then he got made redundant didn't he?
B	yeah I think so
A	he took the cash or whatever
D	yes
A	and then
B	they wanted to well he'd sort of semi-retired and
A	semi-retired they'd got this house and it's got a holiday let with it which she was going to do but the house needed loads of work on it
D	oh
A	they had to rent accommodation for about a year well
D	that's
A	while
D	depleting the golden
A	it's
D	handshake
A	yes while he did the work he fell seriously ill
D	yeah because he was
A	without putting too far a point on it erm and had operations et cetera so he couldn't do the work and then he got better then he got the work then they discovered the damp course was wrong the erm the soil was too far at the side of the house
D	yeah
A	it was making all the damp the walls
D	yeah
A	damp
D	damp and
A	she was saying it smells horrible in here and it was the damp and
D	mm
A	so that took a long time digging all that off and making that right and then they got it going erm
B	in erm was it
C	oh
B	er in
A	in
D	that is that just outside
A	so things were starting to look up a bit because that means he's away all week
D	oh dear
A	so she's just in the house with
D	yeah
D	ah
A	so she was feeling a bit better
D	mm
A	and then he
D	mm
C	and ruins everything
D	yeah
D	mm
A	you've got to spill the beans
B	yeah
A	she said I wanted to live in
D	mm
A	think about the weather
D	winter time
A	winter yeah
D	particularly in this area
A	mm
D	you see
B	mm
D	you know it's sort of er these places do get cut off and you might the main road is fine
A	yes
D	but to get to it they
C	yeah
D	now have got gaps in
A	mm
D	and the wind blows through that
C	oh yes oh yeah
D	and it blows the snow and what have you
C	drifts it yeah
D	and it all banks up
B	mm
D	but you know these farmers they're er very military and
A	mm
D	what have you
D	and keeping it and don't want to spend a penny
A	no
D	if they can get somebody else to do it
B	mm
A	yes they will do so
D	but that that's er a bit much isn't it? to do that
B	probably wouldn't be as bad if you had a four by four vehicle
D	well that may be so but well I'm glad you mentioned that
C	mm
D	in the the ditch like you see
C	yeah
D	er cos I said to you didn't I
C	mm
D	oh that's gonna take a job getting out and
B	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker D owns a jeep car.	Contradiction
A	mm
D	if you fit winter
A	yeah somebody in earlier said to me we've been trapped in the house for three days because of the snow this is our first time
D	mm
A	we've been out since then and instead I've erm put my winter tyres on
C	mm
D	and
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A doesn't have winter tyres.	Contradiction
A	I said what are winter tyres?
D	yes what are they?
A	he said they're a bit fatter a bit wider
D	yeah
A	so you've got more grip I think
D	mm
B	also a different type of
A	does it?
[ANNOTATION]	The summer tyres are thinner that the winter ones.	Entailment
D	yeah
B	mm
A	do you need a bit more contact?
B	mm
D	I know I know er some people used to I don't know the value of it but you know I can see the logic in it used to instead of having say thirty-two pound pressure
A	oh let a bit out yes
D	they'd let a bit out
A	yes
D	and make it a bit so as it's softer
A	a bit spongier yes
[ANNOTATION]	According to speaker D something is very rough.	Contradiction
D	and er so you know it's a bit fatter
A	a bit more soft
D	cos when you think that is the only contact with the road
A	yes
D	and so really you're probably looking at er five square inches or something on
A	mm
D	on each er
[ANNOTATION]	Tyres are less harmed in sealed roads.	Neutral
A	actual yeah
D	each wheel like
A	mm
D	and that's your contact
A	mm
D	er and in certain instances it
A	yeah
D	it's not enough and
A	right
A	so you'd need to have a lot of supplies laid in if you
C	yeah
A	have the potential to be cut off or
C	mm
A	well it was three days that time
D	mm
A	but it wouldn't necessarily be three it could be longer depending
C	no we didn't have that much did we really?
A	no
B	didn't say
B	that's this
A	country roads that they knew would be
B	I suspect it's between
A	mm
B	avoided which is essentially the back route between
A	yeah
B	and
D	you just look at that er where we had that nice picnic at something hall
A	yes
D	at
B	yes
D	look at that route there
A	yes it's very er
D	and I'm not talking about big deep drifts I'm just talking about say just a little dusting of maybe
A	there are some bad hills there
D	and inch or so
A	sustained hills
B	mm
C	mm
A	with twists
C	mm
D	but you see
A	but it's quite a drive
D	the centrifugal force is doing this and
A	yeah
D	you go
A	and there'd be nobody to help you
D	there used to be a
A	it's really lonely
C	it is
A	down there
D	mm at
C	mm
D	there was a a swing shall we call it? and it was a you know like er wall of death? it was a big round
A	mm
D	er
A	a drum
C	like big wheel
D	wheel sort of thing
A	mm
D	a drum
C	mm
D	and you you went in and there's all cages at the side and you went in one of these and they shut the cage like you're in
A	did you go in?
C	mm
D	oh yeah we've been in mm
A	did you enjoy it?
C	many years ago
A	oh
C	I must admit
A	cos oh
D	oh yeah this was when
A	mm
B	when we were Jack and Jill
B	er and they spin it real fast
A	yes
D	you see so and the flow goes away from you
A	yeah
D	the flow actually goes down
A	mm
D	and you're
A	pushed against the sides
D	pushed against the the side like
A	is that what you said? that's centrifugal force is that?
A	similar
C	and then the floor used to come back and
A	yeah
C	oh dear
A	and you
D	and then it slowed down and you get out
D	you shouted help
D	help things like that
A	I bet
D	stop it
A	yes yeah
C	I want to get down
B	mm
D	er they want to be going but them tyres are gripping so those winter tyres er er I mean I'm coming up for my
C	MOT
D	MOT actually I've got the paper saying you know I I've to make an appointment really and er now then last year on my MOT they there was an advisory tyre
B	yes
D	and they said it was a front one but we moved it from the front to the back he said you're alright you're safe like and we passed any exam now but this year I'd like to bet they pick it up because it's on their what last year's er
B	advisory
D	yeah and they'll see it's advisory so they'll take up a special
A	yeah it could be the same
D	look at that
A	she's in the same
D	so
A	sort of position that I was in
C	yeah
A	two years ago
D	mm
C	yes
A	so
C	yeah
A	so it could be just the
D	well
A	yeah you may be a little bit prone to that and then you get the complication that you're upset about things and then it
D	I mean
A	tips you over
D	look at me I'm
C	mm
D	twice
C	prawns
D	one of them we haven't had any since have we
C	no you're banned that's why
D	I know I'm banned mm I know I'm banned
C	stretcher case you get a prawn
D	I mean
A	mm
D	and I was on I was quite comfortable actually
B	mm
D	and er
C	mm mm
D	but anyhow all the tests come back and what have you this last time I had two ECGs and I had a really good examination and that and it came back a combination
A	mm
D	dehydrated er
A	I'm surprised at
A	dehydrated really
B	mm
A	cos
D	well
A	you're always having cuppas
C	yeah we are
D	well we are but it was a particularly hot day wasn't it
C	it was yes
D	and er I'd sweated a lot
C	mm
D	and when you're sweating a lot you are
A	it's all evaporating
D	it is you are losing a lot of bodily water
A	mm
D	over quite a
C	surface area mm
D	mm and it
C	mm
D	it's amazing what shows up on some of these tests mm and er er it was that and after a meal
C	mm
D	some medication I'm taking
A	oh yeah the medication not quite right
C	yes
A	yeah
D	and that see that is to lower the blood pressure
A	yes and it had
D	you know
A	already done it by itself
D	just yes
A	so it didn't need any help
D	mm
A	yeah
D	and that's it mm and if I'd have got sat down I'd have been alright
A	mm
D	but the fact
A	mm
D	but it's what I'm getting at really it's a combination of things have such a disastrous effect
B	mm
A	the strange thing I find though is that you feel like that when you soon as you wake up you realise
D	yeah
A	ah oh
D	it's gonna be one of the
A	but you're in pain straight away
D	mm
A	whereas you'd think being asleep all night
D	mm
A	you should be nice and rested and relaxed
C	mm
D	I mean when I'm getting up er if I just go to the bathroom at three o'clock in the morning I don't dive straight out of bed and go
A	no sit on the edge for a bit

A	mm
