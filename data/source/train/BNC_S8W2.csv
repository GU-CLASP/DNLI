A	yeah
A	we're er gonna be discussing two theories cos I wanted to hear your thoughts on like whether you think they're very accurate one of them is more about infants than erm actually they're both about like children
A	erm yeah so the first one is a theory by Piaget have you heard of Piaget?
B	Piaget?
A	yeah
C	didn't he invent pasta?
B	is he?
B	really? it's just
B	mine wasn't much better I was gonna come up with some joke about him being erm some concerto pianist
A	well Piaget
C	sorry
A	okay guys this is a serious
C	sorry
A	so Piaget erm oh
C	oh
B	nice pen
A	yeah great isn't it? I just thought it would help us if we discussed using this visual aid
B	yes
A	of the whiteboard
A	Piaget okay so Piaget is one of those like is one of those psychologists that's has really changed the way we view children and how they develop in terms of how they learn new things and how they think
[ANNOTATION]	Piaget is a biologist	Contradiction
C	okay
A	so
B	mm
A	Piaget instead of like emphasising the parents' involvement he really believes that children are actively trying to understand the world around them they're actively doing their own learning and it's they're really independently exploring and trying to figure it out for themselves
B	yeah
A	and it's important as parents
C	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Piaget's work revolutionised how we now view child-rearing	Entailment
A	that we let them do that
B	yep
A	so he says there's two aspects of his model he says that when a child sees something it so a child might see like a zebra and they've never seen one before and they erm
B	really?
A	do a process called accommodation
A	so when they do accommodation they go hold on that's a new thing what am I gonna how am I gonna figure that out? like what is that? so they go oh I've seen a horse before cos it has four legs and erm
C	oh okay
A	a similar head
B	so they'll look for similarities in whatever they've
A	so they look
B	come across?
[ANNOTATION]	The first animal a child sees is a zebra	Neutral
A	yes well done
C	oh come on
A	so that's what they're doing
C	good good job
[ANNOTATION]	According to Piaget, children use accommodation when they see something they've never seen before	Entailment
A	they're they
C	so they say horse?
A	yeah so they they
A	they look for like horses however when they're like comparing it
B	but it can't find them cos it's separate
A	yeah
B	there's no horses
A	so the er
[ANNOTATION]	The example Speaker A provides involves zebras and horses	Entailment
B	what do they do?
A	stop it
A	so they go
A	er yeah
B	oh
A	shush you so then they go but horses don't have stripes so they're in this state of disequilibrium
C	mm
[ANNOTATION]	It is unlikely for a horse to have stripes.	Entailment
A	equilibrium and erm
A	and
B	accommodation is the last thing isn't it?
A	yes
B	cos they're accommodating
A	is the first thing
C	oh assimilating
A	good thing that is in my notes
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A has kept some notes.	Entailment
B	cos things assimilate to other things
A	yeah
B	and they're accommodating in their head for a new
A	er yes
B	erm concept or object
A	indeed so this is a continuous process and this happens like all the time like whenever they're
C	okay
A	doing a new thing so they're always like looking for new things however Piaget also thinks that we go through stages
B	need a hand there buddy?
B	not continuing
B	yes
B	wahoo
A	erm yeah so infants I'm not gonna outline all the stages because you'll get bored but I want to see whether you could you could erm apply this to education but
B	okay
A	in brief every single age group of infants have different like stages that they can cope with in their thinking
[ANNOTATION]	There are multiple stages in an infant's life.	Entailment
B	yep
A	so from the age of nought to two
A	they
B	thought it was an I
A	stage
[ANNOTATION]	Infants think in the same way from age 0-3.	Contradiction
A	yeah
C	is that things like like er holding stuff that feels different?
A	yeah yeah sort of sort of yeah but
B	tactile stuff?
A	basically yeah so the difference between like the senses and moving and all this sort of things
B	hence
A	they
B	sensory motor
A	exactly
[ANNOTATION]	Sensory motor is important when it comes to object movement.	Entailment
A	well done so
A	they in this stage they're really trying to figure out cause and effect relationships
C	okay
B	oh okay
A	cause and effect relationships blah blah blah and erm a thing called object permanence so they when a when a pen disappears from view infants find it really difficult to believe that it still exists even though it's
C	oh okay
[ANNOTATION]	Infants don't believe that something exists if they don't see it.	Entailment
B	hence the classic game peek-a-boo when you hide your face it's that they
A	exactly
B	don't understand where you've gone
A	they
C	ah
B	but I got your notes so it's
A	mm exactly so that is a really good
A	application
B	yes
A	to real life
C	oh good grief
B	that's three nil
A	so erm given this given that children like need to be able to explore and they learn best when they explore independently and learn this stuff on their own how do you think we can teach children to do cause and effect relationships in real life?
B	leaving them alone to discover stuff like leave a baby next to a fire and wait for it to realise
B	that it can burn itself
B	I mean it's to be fair that is cause and effect
A	it is
B	I mean obviously you wouldn't do that that was called a joke cos
B	but it's the same concept
A	but if they were in day care
C	oh okay yeah yeah
A	what toys would you give them?
C	probably things that
B	burn them
C	well like things like you said earlier that feel different to each other so like
A	yeah
C	something that's smooth and then something that's
B	I'm sorry
unknown_female	I'm so sorry
C	I dunno you'd try and get as much different as many different senses in there as you can
A	yeah
C	as many different things as you can as well
A	well
B	so
A	one toy that you could use
B	would is that the shape one? where you have the shaped toys and then the box which has the holes in and
C	oh I think that's the next stage mate
B	oh is that a next stage?
C	well I think that's the next stage
A	probably but the this stage
A	I don't know that
B	maybe it's
A	what you could use are toys that are squeaky toys so when they squeeze them
B	it creates a noise
A	it creates a noise so they
A	but they only learn that from squeezing it themselves if we were to squeeze that for them they wouldn't learn it probably
B	so that's motor and sensory working
C	oh yeah good
B	in in coherence because they're using motor skills
C	yeah
B	to squeeze something and then sensory
A	yeah
B	is there
C	okay
A	or like a button and it makes a noise like music
C	okay okay cool
A	musical noises okay
C	or a jack-in-the-box
A	a jack-in-the-box yeah very good have a piece of chocolate
B	I call this psychology is called positive reinforcement
A	so erm
C	you're really good at teaching
B	mm
A	thank you
B	yeah
A	thank you very much
B	probably not the greatest students are we?
C	well I'm not
C	no I reckon it's pretty both
A	erm
C	no asking me questions
A	I'm just gonna seek my notes just to check I've got the right order
C	can I ask a question about Piaget?
A	of course you can
B	mm
C	so his model is that children it's more to do with children?
A	yeah it's all about the children
C	but the last stage would only you said
B	the cognitive
C	they only find out it's a zebra when someone tells them so if it's
A	wait wait
C	all the children then
B	oh yes that's a good question cos what if?
C	is it literally
A	wait so
C	all down to the parents
B	what if no one
C	teaching? or else they're or else they're just stuck in
A	that's so true
C	assimilation and
B	oh so would would
C	and
B	would it come a stage where a child would come to its own accommodation? it would label an object as different and know it is different and give it another name
C	if there were just children a new language would developed to accommodate that
B	yes
A	mm
B	no it would wouldn't it?
A	it is true though
C	so really the
B	into the current society
C	into the culture
A	oh that's so interesting
B	yeah
A	but do you think but if the parents if they're just hearing it do you think that's still them? they're still exploring the world they're still just hearing it or do you think?
C	oh okay oh that's deep
B	quite mm
A	but I guess if the
C	oh that's true it's their job to like fit it together
A	yeah yeah
C	yeah yeah fair enough
B	yeah
C	fair
A	but I guess it is er it is true the parents someone else as an adult has to say it cos they
C	mm
A	can't read an infant can't read
C	no
A	so
B	so er here's a question that I've got is that you know on Piaget so assimilation is the moment where an infant will realise something is different and identify it as different
A	yeah
B	it won't label it but it will realise oh that's not quite what I've seen before at what stage does does this stop becoming a constant process? because if an infant sees a horse as a a picture of a horse
A	mm
B	and you teach it that's a horse it'll learn that's a horse
A	yeah
B	then if it sees a horse in real life it'll again recognise that's a horse or recognise that from a photo at what stage does an object become different? at what point would it begin to assimilate something different? would it be a different colour to a horse? would it have to be a completely different species? or?
A	yeah
C	yeah that's a good question
A	oh I guess obviously
C	you don't have to know the answers
A	the amount
B	no
A	of experience a child
B	mm
C	oh that's true
A	there will be like much broader general categories like basic level as it's called oh no superordinate level categories so they'll like think it's really broad and they'll call quite a few things horses
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	but I think as they gain more experience
B	mm
A	they'll be like hang on a minute maybe that's not a horse or maybe that's a different horse and then they get their category levels of specificness they it gets more developed to subordinate categories
B	but they do I I assume babies understand that things are different because although if you teach like
A	mm
B	it might see a dog and say
A	exactly
B	little horse
A	yeah
B	but it would recognise for example a rock as not being a horse but if it didn't know what a rock was
A	so when
B	does it just understand that I know what that is I don't know what any of the other things are?
A	it's more when children are younger
A	they're very much relying on their perception to make and their different like parts of
C	reality
A	yeah the different parts of things in order to make
B	okay
A	judgments so they're
B	mm
A	they're very simple it's like how many legs has it got? and and like if it has legs or it doesn't have legs what colour is it? it's very simple
C	mm
A	so I think in terms of like a rock and a horse they know that they're different but a horse and a dog because of it they're so perceptual they're so relying on like
B	on basic structure
A	yeah
B	they
A	yeah
B	therefore it is
A	okay
C	yeah that's cool
B	clever
C	nicely done
unknown_female	mm
A	phew thank you very much okay I'll just do this stage because it'll be boring if you have to go through all of them erm preoperational is the next stage I think it's when they're when they're four? and erm in this stage children are really egocentric
B	mm
A	erm
C	some of us never grew out of that one
A	erm
A	so
A	it's just and they
B	I just know that
A	they find it really difficult to know that other people can't see what they're seeing so they erm so there's this task where there's two people either side of a table and there's loads of mountains in the middle and there's like
B	a table?
A	yeah
B	how big is this table?
A	it's like a model
B	oh okay
A	so
C	and the children aren't very big so
A	so there's a tree on this side
A	and
A	a erm
B	just imagining a mountain range
B	and like literally in the centre of this thousand mile
B	and kids on either side like where are we?
C	sorry sorry
B	what is this monstrous test?
B	all I can see is mountains a horse
B	the table the table has four legs
A	oh erm anyway
C	I I
C	sorry
A	anyway
A	the erm the children are
C	oh okay
B	that's a
A	and the adult
B	really large child and really small adult
A	so this is the child this is the adult erm so the adult goes
A	what
C	oh okay
A	okay erm what can I see? and then they say a tree when really they can't see the tree
C	oh okay so they
A	and then they say and then he said erm the adult goes now I can see a house erm can you see my house? and they go yeah I dunno they're just really they're not
C	confused by it
A	they get very confused so
A	very good very very good yeah like their self-awareness erm
C	mm
A	awareness of others is very
B	so
B	I mean does it have to be a mountain range or could be like a divider in the middle?
A	oh yeah yeah
B	oh just
A	yeah
B	what they're seeing
C	and they can't see what
B	they understand everyone else to be seeing at the same time
A	it's like erm there's also a task where er it's called like false belief tasks and so when a child is
B	that's awful
A	I know so then they go what's inside the box
B	why?
A	and they go pencils and they're like what did you think was in the box? and they're like pencils and then they go okay
C	the
A	they erm they'd be like
B	oh okay
C	oh okay
A	so yeah
B	mm
A	so
A	there we go there's a bit of Piaget I'm now gonna talk about another thing because if we talk about all the stages you're gonna get really bored
C	mm okay this is very interesting
A	erm so this is this is erm
C	Bronfenbrenner?
A	yeah
A	of relationships so this is very similar
C	no this is really good actually
A	this this is like you er the sphere of influence that we did
C	okay oh cool okay
A	so here is the baby
C	is this still about child development?
A	yeah
B	where's the baby?
B	there's the baby
A	there's the baby and this model suggests that surrounding
B	that smile
C	I think you should penalise him I think you
C	I think you should take away all those stickers
B	alright then teacher's pet
B	got an apple for
B	I polished it on my er on my
A	so erm what this model suggests is that there is a microsystem
unknown_female	mm
A	and inside the microsystem are your immediate family
C	mm
B	and
A	and they
B	siblings perchance?
A	yeah yeah so they they erm are really heavily influential on you but because they're so influential on your development it's actually bidirectional because they are actually influential on the immediate family as well
C	yep
A	so
C	so
A	for example
C	oh so the child is indirectly affecting itself?
A	yeah
C	by affecting those around it?
A	exactly so
B	all good gifts around us
A	mm
B	sent
A	so a bad marriage
B	from heaven above
A	a bad marriage can influence the child but a fussy baby can also create frictions in a marriage
C	wow
A	so
B	oh
A	and then vice versa just keeps
C	oh dear
A	so yeah so that's the main
A	principle
A	of the microsystem
C	mm
A	then there's the
B	what's the general area I'm looking for?
A	Bronfenbrenner
B	is that gonna be like er
C	it's the relationships model of
B	is that still on Piaget's? or is that?
A	I think it's on the back oh you're not gonna find it
B	yes no I've got it
A	oh you've got it?
B	Bronfenbrenner's microsystem mesosystem
C	oh like mesomorph?
A	okay
B	yes
A	so
B	nice
A	what's mesomorph?
B	geology isn't it?
C	sorry no carry on
A	oh so in this one it's more like the relationships between like the teacher and the parents and how that can influence the child so there's things like the school and the neighbourhood no that's not there so the teacher their relationship with the parent influential
B	are not all relationships to a degree erm bidirectional?
A	interesting you say that in what way?
B	well I mean just for example in the mesosystem
A	yeah
B	erm if a child behaves really badly in a class some teachers may be less inclined to give it the attention they'd give to an otherwise behaved child
A	that's true
B	probably not good teachers but teachers would do that some
A	yeah
B	at least
A	yeah it's true
B	which would affect the way the child developed and was taught
A	but do you think it's more the relationships in this layer that are affecting the way the child is behaving in the class?
B	oh no definitely that's what affects it
unknown_female	but I'm saying would they not they wouldn't obviously be nowhere near the same extent but are not all relationships
A	yeah
C	what ages is this child sorry?
A	erm that's another part of the thing it's like through time so
C	oh it's okay
A	whenever really
C	clever
A	so you can consider it that's a strength of the model that you can consider it at any point
C	okay
C	that's cool
A	so erm yeah then there's the exosystem now this is erm something
A	a way on the way they act at home and hence influence the child
C	okay yep
B	mm
A	does that make sense?
B	yeah
A	so could you think of any other ways? erm any other indirect so there's like neighbourhood or maybe church or religion
B	oh oh oh
A	very good
C	don't
B	yes chocolate for me
C	how about the weather?
A	the weather it it is true that could affect it
A	it's true
C	or other external circumstances not to do with people
C	well
C	well I dunno like like er
B	how much
C	no no it's a serious point like erm
C	like the er
C	I dunno thinking about people er I dunno other situations like storms or
unknown_female	weather
C	freak weather conditions
B	hurricanes
C	no I dunno I dunno
A	yeah yeah that's true finances how do you
A	what about church? how do you think that will influence things indirectly?
B	well it introduces a child to a new social circle doesn't it? a new set of people
A	true and do you think
B	as well as of course the whole theological impact on a child
A	mm
A	very interesting
B	which has a deep impact psychologically I assume especially from a young age
C	mm
B	and yeah horses and other four-legged things
A	mm
B	they have a deep impact on children I've learned
C	what would you say?
A	erm I would say indirect effects erm I guess oh gosh I've given all my examples away
A	erm indirect effects I guess oh grandparents like ill grandparents
C	that's
A	like could impact the mum they don't live er nearby I dunno quite stressful
C	what about moving house?
A	moving house yeah so that sort of
C	could impact their living
A	so yeah
B	would erm geographical location also make an impact if you lived in a
A	yeah neighbourhood yeah
B	er in a
C	yeah
B	more dangerous area? like it was really icy all the time and people kept slipping over
B	and breaking their hips that could have an impact
A	well do you remember?
A	this model is about relationships
C	oh yeah
B	yeah well
C	you forgot that didn't you?
B	no I didn't forget that
B	if I was a father and I fell and broke my hip
C	you just
B	and my child was whining when I came home I'd be less inclined to be quite so nice with the child
A	you are correct in part though because neighbourhood if it's er there's quite aggressive criminal
B	oh
A	oh dear
C	aggressive criminal
C	throwing
A	so yeah
A	do you think?
A	okay here's a question
C	okay
A	erm there's also another layer but it's not that important
B	what? the macro?
C	oh
A	it's your
B	polite cos you're British
A	so how do you what do you think a child who lives
C	I dunno cos I
B	I am not a royal baby I have I haven't
C	I haven't had that experience
B	I haven't met any royal babies so
C	what I'm gonna guess is
A	yeah what would you guess?
C	my guess is
B	they'd have more of a penchant for classical music
B	I assume
B	erm they probably get out less
C	maybe the you're you may have different people who are in the micro-circle like nannies
B	mm
C	and et cetera
A	yeah
B	yes
A	that's true
B	mm
A	how do you think that would affect a child?
C	erm I think if there's still ample contacts with the immediate family as in like still contact with mum and dad what you'd have is you'd probably have different strands then going out you'd have the nanny's mum and dad and how that affects
A	true true
C	so there'd be those different forces going
B	mm in my it cos er
A	mm
unknown_female	yeah
B	with children erm angsty issues
A	yeah definitely I was thinking erm yesterday about how a boarding environment
C	yeah yeah
B	mm
A	like really makes
C	what do you think that happens in that
A	well I actually looked up some research they they have like it's so different to a child who's going to a day school because you're so you've got one socialisation setting so
C	yeah
A	your teachers are all here like your peers are very much here
C	especially in a small school
A	yeah so erm it's just different but they actually I was expecting all the research to be like they're messed up people like they I dunno
C	yeah
A	so
C	so
A	you actually the effects
B	mm
A	aren't as negative as you could think
C	yeah that's good
A	so
C	well look at you
B	yeah you're
A	thank you
B	a relatively well rounded individual
A	so yeah
A	well done class
C	that was good
B	good job
A	thanks
A	thank you thank you
C	I like yeah I think you've got a good sort of like erm teaching like thing as well
A	yeah
C	like the way you like ask questions and say
B	yes no that was really good
B	I'd say with some less than expected answers
A	shall I just say at the bottom like just in case I don't do well please contact the recording company
A	of this thing
C	erm what's the erm?
B	oh no
C	it was going so well
A	oh no
A	oh
B	thank you class have a good day
C	erm by the way University Challenge is starting
A	yeah you need to go
C	very soon
A	thanks guys
B	alright wonderful
A	do we have any kitchen towel?
B	no we don't
A	oh no
