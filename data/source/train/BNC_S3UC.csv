B	are you recording?
B	yeah
B	I think it might be digital memory
A	digital memory
A	I'm so fucking scared
B	of what?
A	of being engaged
B	why?
A	like don't take this the wrong way
A	I'm twenty years old right so I mean well
A	I know but
B	you should be ready for it
A	I am in a way ready for it
B	but you said it's not gonna be for six years or so anyway
A	yeah it's gonna be from it's not gonna be for ages yet but
A	but but like
B	I don't think it's necessarily a new thinking to you know what I think it's slightly
A	I know but it's like do you know what I mean?
A	yeah like all the girls wanna
B	yeah
A	no but like do you know when you're told you can't I don't know if you're the same but I am very malcontent like I
A	and I'm like that and I'm thinking yeah I could do this and I could do that
B	I'm not I'm not a
A	no but like
B	I've got a lot more of
A	yeah but I have every single human in the world has
B	yeah
A	but the thing is like basically now I have committed to spending the rest of my life with one person and don't get me wrong I love
B	yeah
A	and I could never do it but I really want to because I can't and it's not even just that I can't it's like the fact that I'm twenty-three years old like do I really want to settle down with one person now for the rest of my life? and I have I've got two choices I can either
B	the difficulty is is
A	mm
A	mm
B	everything that happens like that is it it happens and there will be obstacles that come up
A	mm
B	like mixed feelings
A	yeah
B	I don't know where they come from but er
A	no I have I've already I've already and it's probably the wine the wine making me say this but I have always found you attractive when I first met you I thought you were attractive and I fancied you and I have always fancied you and we have
B	I have
A	you know and it's like it's so difficult and I love
B	he's probably ready to do this
A	he's ready to do it and I don't know if I am
B	right
A	and I don't know if I and he wants children and shit like that and I don't think I do like don't get me wrong right now I don't want children ever like right now I think my life
A	it would stop everything it would stop everything
A	it's different for a man
B	yeah
A	like they can
B	yeah
A	they don't have to breast-feed they don't have to do all that shit and like to me it's so scary because like I'm gonna graduate university when I'm twenty-six and I'm doing a year in industry so the next four years I've got another
B	you've got everything planned out that you're doing so
A	I'm doing stuff and my plan when I finish uni will always be travel always
B	no
A	what if
B	no
A	what if blah blah what if
B	or er and you don't wanna do either of em
A	and I don't wanna do either
A	I don't wanna cheat and I don't wanna like
A	I mean awful like cos er
B	what I will do is erm you go away for a while don't don't be in contact for like a month or whatever and then see if
A	yeah
B	mm
A	you can eat off this menu and that's it
A	yeah
B	I I
B	er a greater extent but it is nothing I can relate to I suppose
A	so anyway let's get off the personal things and
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	they goanna get personal things	Entailment
A	I'd like to talk about erm so you want to be a music teacher?
A	don't you don't you think
B	I know
A	no I know but it's not cos I don't want to it's because every time you have something going on I have something going on and I'm always devastated
B	don't
[ANNOTATION]	person B not sure that want music teacher	Neutral
A	no but I'm always devastated and whether you make it or not I'm always devastated that I can't get
B	there's a there's a lot of fans out there yeah and what I will say there's a lot of
A	you are different
B	and I think
A	like I can't put erm I can't stick a genre on you do you know when
B	I call it I say like indie rock but some of the songs aren't that so I
A	no
B	er my favourite band is the Red Hot Chili Peppers yeah?
A	yeah
B	and I've always loved them because
A	me too
B	yeah really?
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about a film	Contradiction
A	I love the Red Hot Chili Peppers absolutely fucking adore them I've grown up with them and I fucking
B	like I I wasn't quite like that the thing I love about them is like every album's different they're not just rock like there'll be a song full of like
A	different innit?
B	yeah
A	every single thing they do from the first to the current album every single album is different it offers something else
B	but that that's what I love about them that's why my
A	really?
B	we all
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about weather	Contradiction
A	they stick with one thing don't they? like Kasabian's latest album is the same as every other album they've ever done
B	yeah I hate that one as well
A	I fucking hate it
A	forty-eight thirty-three or something
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about something that hate it	Entailment
A	like why
B	got erm they've got one song on it so like easy which was a single which I thought were alright and I listened to the entire album like
A	shit
B	oh
A	yeah it's the same it's the same as all the rest right?
B	do you know who I think's really good at the moment?
A	it I I love Ed Sheeran cos like he does like a song he'll do one song say he'll do a really slow song and be really downbeat and like really like life affirming or whatever and then you'll listen to his next song
A	erm and then you'll listen to the next one like completely different the ones that you've heard the first time and that's what I love about him he's different he doesn't stick to oh I'm so depressed and I hate everyone and I'm singing melancholy songs and it goes up and it then goes back down but oh I love that about him really do like that he changes but you listen to pop songs and they all sound the same
B	yeah
A	like don't get me wrong I love pop songs I love listening to like
B	you a top forty pop person?
A	no
B	oh so
A	I love really obscure bands like I love The Smiths
B	oh right
A	Blur Chili Peppers have you ever heard erm Crash Test Dummies?
A	they were like erm all the songs sound the same in a way but that's because the singer the lead singer has got a distinct voice
B	right
A	so so all his songs they don't sound the same the melody the melody's different the chords or whatever they are
A	they all sound different
B	you learn
A	yeah I'm learning but his his voice is so distinct that this this
B	the only real
A	he can rap and sing
B	yeah he can do everything he is brilliant
A	yeah
B	but there's not a lot of people out there right now that are different there's a lot of people that have similar voices or something like that and what I wanna do is I don't have a great natural voice I want to make my voice something different
A	special
B	I want to make it stand out
A	yeah
B	even if I can't

A	yeah
B	but I can't do it but I can I can compromise
