A	and did she get it out of that as well didn't you have tan all over that?
C	yeah it's still a bit pinky
A	oh mother
B	where?
C	but I reckon if it goes no but that was literally it rained and everything
A	mother
B	but did you tell me you'd got tan on it because otherwise I would have well give it me back and I'll put some Vanish on it
C	it wasn't me
D	that was like that video that I tagged you in did you watch it?
C	no it's only at the back
B	I'll put some Vanish on it
D	but then I don't know if it is tan
A	oh no because it looks like it's down the
D	let's have a look
C	this bit
A	that bit I don't know
C	so I don't actually know I do like this yeah
B	well if you don't tell me I don't know do I?
D	it's like that video innit that I tagged you all in girls after a night out why the fuck did I wear the white shorts? there's fucking tan everywhere
A	that was so funny even though
D	we ate a melon I think one night
A	oh
D	because that was incredible
A	we were
A	oh yeah
D	I love that dress
A	I like it but it just looked rubbish on me
D	what size is it?

A	are they even taller?
D	yeah but they are thicker
C	yeah but when you think about it right look you

A	oh look at my toes though
D	yes that's a good idea

D	cos you could wear the white one and then I don't know what top but
C	I'm sure we could find a top

A	but you have to choose
D	I think a night out because they'll be comfortable but you would look nice

D	stuck on things isn't it
A	so we got outfit so I could wear my hippy dress for the evening meal on Friday couldn't I because that's quite comfy actually like
D	oh I don't know

C	why can't you wear heels though?
A	well I can
C	if you are just staying in
D	so what are doing?

B	what do you think?
A	yeah
C	so why can't you wear heels you will only be in
A	do you ever what

C	mm
A	yeah and I'm quite and it like skims over that bit
C	cos I was very conscious but it's not a cutting in skirt it's a little bit looser isn't it?
A	yeah
D	because it goes out even if your belly goes bloated and it skims forward it's a poofy style dress so you will just think it's the poof rather than belly
A	yeah
C	the top does rise up a little bit every now and again you just have to keep pulling it down
A	yeah that's fine
C	yeah just wear no VPL knickers
A	yeah that's fine but what bra? could I borrow your bra?
C	I wore a strapless bra yeah I don't know where it is

C	yeah the naked chef is before going out
A	yeah
D	yeah but you don't want to spill food down it because then
A	I will be annoyed with myself if I get something down it cos I want to wear it out now
C	well why don't you then wear the white dress oh no because that's white mm
A	I would wear I do love that dress
C	do you want to wear that Friday then?
A	but but that's still eating but then it's cocktails as well isn't it?
C	yeah
D	what about my blue and white dress that's a T-shirt dress?
C	mm that's nice

C	so is that Friday?
A	yeah
C	or Saturday?
D	no that's Saturday before that isn't it?
[ANNOTATION]	The event is not on Sunday.	Entailment

C	you know you are gonna wanna
A	yeah like yeah like you said for only like photos
D	the only thing is if you are in the house and you are like say sitting on the settee or something and it's really short
A	yeah you will see up there
D	mm that's the only thing
A	what heels could I wear with my other one? that one
D	those brown ones
A	so shall I just shall I just wear that Friday?
D	mm yeah
A	cos that is really comfy like it just goes over my belly
