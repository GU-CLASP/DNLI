D	yeah it's it's like who can come up with the best reason to explain it
A	yeah
D	some abstract fancy fluffy reasoning
A	that's right
C	and what the artist was thinking at the time of producing it
A	yeah
C	just loving it and looking at it
D	yeah
B	mm
D	like this plug represents emotion
A	yes
D	stopping the the flow of negative feeling
A	or I I would say it's rather sexual

B	they did they
A	they did didn't they
B	and they had um a load of artists competing to have space in the Versace gallery for a year or something

B	in a socket
D	yeah
B	how the plug going into the socket is so vital of the little parts of your life being plugged in at different times

C	yeah but to actually
A	you do yeah

C	no he created some weird
A	no he
C	for people to look at

D	yeah I'm sure there were
A	doing that
D	hmm
A	yeah
D	mm
C	well I was just thinking mum you've got a textile art picture of that photo up there haven't you? I think you should take three textiles because the tiger is a different style to the other types of textile art that you've done
B	yeah
C	so I think you should take three because then
A	she hasn't got one of that one up there
B	three?
C	yeah that's what  yeah that's what  thought
A	which one?
C	A
D	mm
B	that actually is one that I've been planning on doing
C	oh
B	Cos er I could see that in the velvet
C	yeah I can see that as textile
B	and that's why I did it that
C	mm
B	I think that'd be quite good
C	haven't you got a woodland textile art though?
B	mm
A	she sold the bluebell wood
C	oh you sold it
B	which everyone seems to want
A	yeah
C	so do some more woodland
B	oh
A	yeah
B	that was the first bit I've ever done
D	hmm
C	mm
B	so I was  I was  surprised at that
A	that's gonna be a beautiful day again look
C	well now that the fog has lifted
B	and the the girl who bought that
C	mm?
B	she's doing  she's doing  textiles at art college
A	yeah she's doing textiles at art college now
C	really?
B	yeah
A	she
C	because of your picture?
A	yeah
C	you inspired her?
B	well she bought it from us so
A	that weren't for sale when we put it into the art show
C	yeah
A	it was not for sale but she came up to us and asked us or asked
C	which?
B	so if we'd sell it to us after
A	after
C	how much did you sell it for?
B	A hundred
A	hundred and  hundred and
C	not enough
B	hundred
A	yeah hundred yeah
C	all of that work that you did
B	but if I'd have had to sell it at erm
A	oh well that was the first one that she'd ever sold

B	there it would have been a hundred and thirty
C	yeah
C	cool
A	I sold  I sold  one
B	just that's what she offered me
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	she said would that be enough
A	yeah
C	you should have said no not not enough
A	no
B	I was so ah
D	put another zero and that and you might be coming close

A	poultec centre
B	dad's were dad sold first
C	which one did you sell
A	I sold the Blue Sunset or something weren't it?
B	mm
C	see what I'm what I think because I was saying this to mum because you're selling these pictures but when you look at the picture on the wall you don't know who it's by
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	just in the corner of the frame
B	yeah the logo thing would be quite good but it's a bit complicated innit
A	yeah
C	so which so you sold which one?
A	I sold Blue Sunset
B	erm it's up in the
A	and then we sold The Shawl
B	it's up in the
A	we sold The Shawl
C	what's that one?
B	up in the guest room that one is the dad's one
A	which is a a walk it's a walk in Yorkshire
C	mm
A	where Queen Ann? I think that was Queen Ann wasn't it?
B	mm
A	well one of the queens was walking and lost her shawl
C	oh
B	queen Mary
A	queen Mary
B	scots queen
A	queen Mary
B	queen of Scots
A	queen of Scots
C	and it grew into a rock?

B	yeah
C	oh
A	that is the legend anyway
B	mm so they call it The Shawl
C	oh
A	and they call the place The Shawl
B	mm
D	hmm
A	but that was
B	yeah I think so yeah
A	yeah
C	ah
B	we haven't sold many
C	but but you have sold a few that
A	sold a few yeah
C	like how many people can say they've sold their photos or their art work? It's lovely
A	yeah
B	mm
C	I know you've done quite a lot of exhibitions and stuff
B	well you've sold
C	as a  as a  card wasn't it
B	as a erm well you got eight pound for it didn't you
C	ah a little one yeah
D	hmm hm
A	yeah
C	ooh
B	what happens when you do different sizing though?
D	mm
C	it's still that photo
A	yeah that is still the photo
C	you have to say
D	and what happens if if like you sell ten
A	yeah
D	can you not er huh a way round it can you change it in Photoshop? Can it like a tiny tiny little bit
B	I guess you could
C	that's cheating
D	and it's a different photo
A	well I suppose you could but that would be rather cheating wouldn't it
C	that's not fair
A	it would but do people must do that though
B	different colouring
A	I think they must do that yeah
D	mm
A	well yeah
D	it's so easy to
A	that's right
C	it is a shame almost that
D	it loses the uniqueness doesn't it?
C	mm
A	yeah
B	mm
A	that's so easy to cheat
D	yeah
A	you can people where they weren't
D	yeah um you can change everything can't you
A	yeah
B	what you?
D	A couple of clicks with the button
A	yeah
C	mm
D	mm
C	right we should get going mum
B	okay
C	um that picture that what's the name of that flower? I've forgotten
B	bird of Paradise
C	bird of Paradise
A	in the other room
C	shall we get that?
A	we're not taking that though are we?
B	huh?
C	why? I think that would sell
D	yeah
C	yeah
A	you can't take everything though can you? We can take it along another time
B	yeah okay we've got quite a lot to carry haven't we
A	you've got a lot of stuff to take
C	okay
B	if they're interested they can go on the website you see that's what I thought
C	yeah
B	mm
A	that took me ages getting that one together
C	ow
A	oh yeah
B	oh yeah
C	you know things like that
A	yeah
C	so you've gotta make a run
D	mm
C	Cos it is like a trend isn't it?
A	yes it is yeah
C	and that one as well
A	yeah
C	make sure that they're all on the website
B	you know what that is don't you
C	yeah
B	oh
A	yeah
C	behind the flower?
B	yeah
A	behind the flower yeah
C	yeah but that's what they're doing er even down the road
A	probably
C	they
D	mm
B	I see right
C	I don't know
B	oh really?
A	yeah
D	mm
C	and like the first I saw was yours
B	did you? It brings it out a bit
C	yeah
D	and I think that if you've got these on like all your flower ones
A	yeah all yeah yeah
C	yeah
D	because if it's in a set it makes it more appealing
A	yeah
C	yeah and then people go oh which one? Which one do you like best?
A	you should have like flowers
D	well rather than going
B	yeah group them yeah
A	group
D	yeah rather than going from that to say that one to say a picture of a swan
A	yeah
C	I think they are fairly
D	and it's all different kind of genres
B	yes they are
D	but if you take put all that together
B	they are a bit of a mixture aren't they
A	they are a mixture yeah
D	it creates a look and it creates an image for you as well
A	yeah
B	mm
C	especially the flowers
D	mm
C	I think you should focus on them
D	mm
B	we can easily group the swans and that together can't we now
C	they're beautiful
A	yeah
D	yeah
C	but are they different pictures from both of you? Like
B	what the swans?
C	you've taken some like swans and flowers and you've taken some swans and some flowers?
B	yeah
A	yeah well we we we're normally in the same place every time
B	Cos that's dad's and that's dad's and that one er over there is mine
C	I think you should put them all together
A	yep
C	I think you should put them all together
D	mm
B	what? Oh I see in our
D	yeah
B	mm
D	yeah
A	mm yeah
C	yeah you could have your separate folder for the things couldn't you?
A	yeah
C	and then you could have a swans link yeah or a flowers link
D	mm you could have  you could have  swans woodland flowers
B	oh down the side?
C	yeah and put
A	well yeah that's that's what most of the photographers do on these sites
B	so everyone's would be together like landscapes yeah
C	yeah
B	landscapes animals birds
D	mm
A	yeah
C	that's a good
A	that's what most of the photographers do
B	yes I guess they do
A	yeah
C	so you can look at them in two different er ways
B	yeah but all all the all of them will go in
D	you can go to what you're interested in straight away
A	you can yeah
C	mm
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	mountains
B	or even er other countries or something like that
C	er mountains
