A	okay tell me about it I don't I don't really know what shellac is
B	so yeah so basically it's like erm
A	okay
B	and it stays it's chip-resistant because it's gel and polish and it's cured under UV light
A	oh okay so it's
B	I was so excited
A	huh
B	so my friend
A	yeah
B	erm had put it on Facebook and she was like oh I'm selling it and she had like like erm
A	yeah
B	and she'd got the shellac stuff so all the polishes

B	she's got this which is like the original shellac's like the original
A	oh my god so this makes it really super shiny the top? oh amazing oh
B	yes yes yeah look I'm I'm I'm learning it but so what you do is it takes literally no time at all
A	okay
B	so I've got shellac and I've also got this stuff called Gelish which is like a cheaper version of shellac
A	mm right
B	and there's also one called blue sky as well which you can buy or sky blue
A	okay is this a
B	yeah like
A	cos I keep seeing it whenever I go to get a manicure and I don't really understand what it is
B	yeah yeah so you can have it done at salons
A	yeah she just said it takes longer and it's lasts longer?
B	it lasts really it lasts ages
A	yeah
B	so it's basically erm it's polish and it's erm yeah UV dried so you literally
A	okay
B	you put a coat on you you erm
A	okay
B	and then you well you you yeah and you have to like erm clean them
A	so what you just like file them and stuff?

B	and then
A	you use these nail things to clean them with just normal nail varnish remover?
B	use those to get all your nail varnish off yeah
A	okay
B	just acetone remover
A	okay
B	it takes about five minutes five or ten minutes to get the shellac stuff off

A	yeah yeah oh okay
B	so it comes off in one sheet if you like
A	oh cool
B	erm so you take that off
A	yeah
B	and then a bit of this Scrubfresh and it makes them all nice and clean and dry
A	yeah okay okay
B	and with the shellac stuff you do a base coat and then you put it under
A	mm yeah oh that's the top coat that's the base coat yeah?
B	yeah and then you put it under the UV light
A	okay
B	for thirty seconds
A	mm
B	and then you do the colour coat
A	okay
B	and then thirty seconds again

B	and then the second coat is two minutes
A	okay
B	and the third coat is two minutes as well
A	and the
B	which is the top coat
A	okay
B	and once you've done that it's feels sticky when you've done it
B	and then you do use a bit of this again and it takes the sticky residue off and just leaves them all shiny
A	oh okay ah

A	yeah
B	they were saying you know a bit of sunshine'd be good for you but but we're not saying yes you should
A	yeah they're not allowed to say it

B	yeah
A	what's the difference between light treatment and sun showers then?
B	well the the erm light treatment at the hospital is er is very controlled

A	ah
B	obviously I don't know the strength of a sun shower I just know that sun is really good for my skin
A	yeah yeah
B	erm so we go on holiday

A	yeah
B	it was really lovely I went to
A	oh good haven't you? oh I always go there although I don't
B	yeah
A	and I'd forgotten that I have to tell them to keep the layers quite short
B	yeah
A	otherwise they all want to give me long layers and it just makes it a bit triangular
B	yeah yeah
A	and I don't like it so I
B	yeah
A	so I got two vouchers this time erm although frustratingly I've got like two old vouchers that I didn't have time to spend one's got twenty quid and one's got like ten quid on

A	okay okay
B	so I've been like oh no I better not go blonde it won't suit me it won't suit me
A	okay
B	so erm eventually
A	yeah
B	you know in two weeks or whatever and you haven't made an appointment I was like okay and I was like and he was like go to
A	yeah yeah
B	and I was and also I've cos I've always been really
A	oh okay

A	when it used to be up in Neal's Yard yeah
B	yeah well it was
A	yeah exactly yeah it's very true yeah
B	they're gonna look after you don't be stupid and I was like oh yeah oh yeah course they are I don't you know
B	so anyway I went in there and I saw erm
A	yeah
B	first off erm had a chat with her and she said erm she could put some oil on my hair which was amazing and really calmed it down
A	mm okay
B	and I was like oh thanks very much and I was like and she said erm I can't book you in but I'm gonna book you in with
A	yeah oh yeah yeah I've heard about
B	and
A	and she's from a family of hairdressers did she tell you that? yeah she's yeah
B	yes I know and she's really lovely and she's only young I think she lives with her dad
A	oh okay
B	and she erm and yeah she's been there for god knows how long
A	yeah
B	and she's got really curly hair
A	yeah she has yeah
B	which erm she straightens
A	yeah some yeah
B	interestingly and it's
A	yeah
B	she said I'm gonna book you in with
A	mm yeah mm
B	erm I was like okay fine so I went in and I saw
A	mm mm yeah
B	really took her time as well like to the point where I was in there for about three hours
A	oh wow
B	so I had and she she gave me advice on you know erm blue shampoo? have you ever seen it? you there's an advert for it called Touch it's Touch of Silver the erm one you can buy in like the any any
A	er okay yeah yeah mm yeah yeah
B	and erm she said cos they have blue shampoo at the salon and it smells amazing
A	is it blue malva? no that's black malva they use yeah anyway carry on
B	yeah
A	all their shampoos smell amazing
B	oh my god it was er fantastic so
A	yeah
B	and so I had my hair wash had this the she put this blue shampoo on it I'd had these foils in for ages
A	mm
B	I was like oh my god this is the longest hairdressing visit I've ever had
B	erm and er and then she made it look amazing like absolutely amazing
A	oh wow
B	and she said and so er she she like did a gradual so it's like I need to go back
A	mm
B	but I'm not going back this month because of because I'm having my party in January
A	yes
B	I'm gonna have it done in December
A	oh yeah big time
B	so it's nice for Christmas and my birthday
A	yeah definitely
B	rather than having it done now and then oh I need to get it done again
A	yeah yeah no yeah good plan yeah
B	so obviously not spending ninety odd quid on my hair meant that I had to spend a hundred pounds on that
B	so that's fine that's justified
A	yeah
B	but erm yeah she was just really nice and really helpful and she said erm
A	oh cool
B	and I bought that because I was
A	yeah
B	talking to her about my hair and I said you know it's just so it gets so frizzy and I get
A	mm
B	you know and I get really annoyed with it and I can't if it rains or if it's humid like if I went to Ecuador
A	yeah
B	exactly like that yeah
A	I will not come back with
B	mm cornrows cornrolls yeah
B	yeah so that's exactly it that's what happens to me is that it any any kind of humidity in Spainactually I straightened it once and then the
A	yeah yeah oh yeah? yeah it's quite was it humid in Spain? or was?
B	hot just hot yeah but it was like you know it was like erm
A	dry hot though yeah?
B	yeah so I couldn't
A	er yeah okay
B	so it I could it wouldn't have stayed
A	yeah yeah
B	you know er er straight and
A	yeah
B	and
A	yeah okay yeah
B	you know twice a week and I'm gonna straighten it whereas before I was washing my hair nearly every day but I don't need to cos it's not it doesn't get greasy
A	mm oh you're only washing it? oh okay
B	it takes about a week before it gets greasy
B	yeah I know it's just doesn't
A	I have to shower I also feel like I can't quite face the day unless I've had a shower
B	I do that but I've got a shower cap now which is awesome
A	oh
B	and I don't know what I'd do without it
A	mine gets
B	so
A	yeah I think mine's I don't know what my hair is she's the hairdresser said it was thick but it feels quite
B	yeah mm well
A	possibly cos I wash it so often
B	yeah no I wash mine less now which is good as well cos I'm spending less on shampoo
A	feels like a vicious circle
B	but she said but
A	yeah
B	you can buy it in other places and I was like okay
A	yeah
B	and I was like that's really nice because they're not saying oh you need to buy this
A	yeah that's good yeah
B	but then when I'd
A	yeah
B	that's not gonna be too greasy and she was like this she was like gave me three different products and that's the one I chose
A	mm that looks great oh cool
B	yeah it was twenty-two quid so
A	yeah I yeah I I
B	yeah
A	and that's how much it costs
B	yeah
A	but yeah you should try if you buy any other Aveda products you should try Lookfantastic
B	but it's worth it
A	Lookfantastic dot com
B	but erm yeah so I bought I bought that
A	that's I always get stuff from there
B	and actually my visit to the hairdressers cost me ninety
