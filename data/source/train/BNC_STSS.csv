A	it's it's a necessity
C	I have to

A	Cos I tried to do it like you like you would do a normal times
C	yeah
A	that
C	that's wrong
A	that's wrong

[ANNOTATION]	The problem can be solved in the way Speaker C did.	Contradiction

A	uh
C	so you know he was like oh I could we could meet up if you're not gonna come to the village for a while and I was like um yeah no I you know
A	yeah
C	um uh and he said Can I ask you a question? And I said yes

A	step on anyone's toes
C	yeah
A	I know

A	toothless wonder
C	oh

C	that's about what I was seeing on Friday
A	no

A	not even gammy teeth
A	it's really not like I think he's just full of himself
C	I know he's a bit weird it's a bit worrying

C	yeah
A	mm
C	well you know when you're at school

C	yeah
A	yeah
C	no we wouldn't notice though
A	body? Haven't got body dysmorphia

A	I love it how people tell other people they've got body when they've probably just got it themselves
C	mm
A	actually yeah the
C	mm
A	really really high it's something ridiculous like eighty percent
C	it's like that girl on Gok's Fat Teens
A	mm
C	fat on this girl and I'm like oh my god like it's so dangerous
A	yeah
C	so impressionable
A	some of the girls at Top Shop their legs didn't touch in the middle
C	God
A	yeah
C	mm
A	and we used to call her bow legged
C	mm
A	like it wasn't attractive
C	no I mean it's not attractive is it like
A	did you see that same girl when she had took photos of herself and then edited them?
C	mm
A	that's like what
C	really?
A	like she's so so vain
C	mm
A	that are supposed to look really natural like her and a cat or something
C	mm
A	yeah and
C	mm
A	um
C	mm
C	mm
A	um your outfit's great

A	I like the butter taste
C	is that alright? Aw
A	mm
C	which one? The one from last week?
A	mm
C	mm
A	and I can't remember if he was with them or not
C	ah
A	I don't think he was
C	ah
A	mm
C	mm
A	I'd definitely do a vacate I think
C	mm mm mm mm
A	mm
C	yeah
A	mm
C	yeah
A	that's what I need to do in my life
C	mm
A	because Chel still cuts
C	oh right
A	um she text him actually yesterday saying he'd gone in for his haircut
C	mm
A	mm
C	oh
A	um but cos she's even though I met her through
C	mm
A	cos he started having his hair cut at Tony and Guy when we moved down here and that
C	mm
A	so then she used to come and do both
C	mm
A	mm
C	oh
A	we always have a great gossip
C	that's so mean
A	yeah I know
C	that is really funny
A	I was like he just it's just something about I said well he shouldn't have grown it into a long fringe to cover his eyes if he's gonna see her this weekend
C	oh really he's there this weekend is he?
A	dunno
C	Don't know
A	I assume so
C	mm
A	we were staying in the same room
C	mm
A	that's what angered me I was like you see her all the fucking time
C	mm
A	like I can understand why I don't think he's being  I don't think he's being  ridiculous but he should of called her a month ago
C	yeah he really should of done
A	and to be fair if he'd have made plans with me for my birthday a month in advance I'd have gone to see I'd have gone with my friends a time around that
C	mm
A	D'you know what I mean like it's not
C	mm
A	it's not on the exact day of your birthday
C	well but I mean there's no need to is there?
A	no
C	no I don't think she's really anything to worry about
A	no
C	well yeah
A	I think he's just spineless
C	he just handled it really badly
A	I don't think he's thinking of me all I
C	oh really?
A	yeah
C	oh right
A	and I was I that's why I got so angry cos I was like you're all you
C	mm
A	like you don't know her
C	mm
A	that's why I got so agitated with it cos he was just like ooh I'm not sure I'll
C	mm
A	what you calling me for?
C	mm
A	talk to her
C	what's your problem?
A	yeah
C	yeah absolutely
A	either way we've made plans now if you're not comfortable we won't go I don't care
C	mm
A	but as far as I'm concerned that would be a really shitty thing to do
C	mm
A	to your friends
C	mm
A	to throw a gift back in the face just in case someone that you barely know doesn't feel very good about it secretly
C	mm
A	and he was like oh yeah
C	it's um a part of it probably is that he can't trust himself around you as well
A	mm
C	like last time you were alone together he got his wanger out so
C	you know there is that danger
A	yeah and on the phone he was like oh I know that was such a stupid thing to do
C	mm
A	I didn't get mine out
C	oh
[ANNOTATION]	they are not sure is it danger or not	Neutral
A	mm
C	and just go with you know how you're feeling as opposed to what you're thinking
A	yeah
C	yeah whatever
A	just because he's a knobber
C	he's a massive bumder
A	right
C	chop it
A	straighten it to death
C	chop it off
A	straighten it to death
A	I hate doing that
C	yeah well that that's exactly what I haven't done in the last
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about done in the last	Entailment
A	I hate reading booklets
C	the booklet was tiny so I thought well there's nothing that I it's gonna tell me anyway
A	actually to be fair when I got my Samsung Galaxy Ace the booklet didn't tell me anything about the phone
C	oh
A	although there
C	well presume there'd be
A	when I first turned mine on it offered me a tutorial and I said naa
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about cell phone	Entailment
C	figure it out
C	no don't want that
A	oh look at this by the way

C	shit
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	they are not sure what is that	Neutral
C	oh that's not okay
A	yeah

A	that tin noise
C	that's I
A	you can join people together?
C	well apparently
A	why would you ever need to do that?
C	I was gonna say I don't know why
A	this phone's not sounding very considerate at the moment
C	it's
A	like an email group?
C	like an email group exactly
A	I wonder if you go to the photograph and then you click on the photograph and then put add to contact
C	yeah well I did that and then it I dunno where that went
A	ahh
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker C has already done what speaker A suggested.	Entailment
C	but no it was only gonna do it to the email address
A	ah
[ANNOTATION]	Something was supposed to happen in the email address.	Entailment
C	I'm like where's that where's that where's where's that where does that live?
A	D'you know what? How do people in the Vodafone shop know all the phones?
C	yeah
A	D'you know what I mean like how d'you know all the phones?
C	well to be honest it's probably only a handful that people actually want
A	yeah
C	lots of people probably want it
A	I think your photos are media
C	yeah well I thought so but no there's nothing in there
A	oh right okay
C	Don't be silly
C	hilarious
A	think that's what they like
C	no see again this is just giving me email addresses
[ANNOTATION]	People who work for Vodafone have no clue about the phones in the store.	Contradiction
A	are they actually saved? The is the phone number actually saved in there?

A	like have you saved your mum's number?
C	yeah
A	you can see it
C	in under contacts it's got the email addresses and the phone numbers
A	oh
C	but maybe one's saved to the phone and one's saved to the SIM
[ANNOTATION]	The number of speaker's C mother is saved to the SIM memory.	Neutral
A	shouldn't make any different like you should be able to save pictures to anybody anywhere
C	oh yeah you would've thought so
C	master class

C	well my mum can do it
[ANNOTATION]	Pictures cannot be saved in phones.	Contradiction

A	that's why I don't like unless I'm having it cut
C	yeah
A	she doesn't blow dry it or anything
C	yeah
A	and to be honest when I have it cut she only blow dries it because otherwise she can't see if she's done it properly
C	yeah
A	cos there's so much of it
C	yeah
A	um and she just goes
A	I said you say this now but imagine when I go grey and the all the hair's even thicker and wirier

C	I mean she's only gotta deal with it for an hour
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	I've wasted doing hair
C	yeah
A	half an hour a day to do my hair
C	blimey seems a bit excessive
A	it is innit?
C	yeah
A	I mean I suppose that's part of being a a teenager and being a bit obsessive with it
C	yeah
A	but I've got it down to a fine art
C	right
A	like I could do it with my eyes closed
C	yeah well I think the grass is always greener isn't it? Like you've got thick then you want think hair if you've got curly hair you want straight hair
A	no
C	oh my god
A	yeah I know I didn't think it through but imagine how much there would've been
C	it would've been massive
A	it would've been like eighties
C	yeah
A	yeah I wanted it cut cos that's you know in that picture I showed you of me and
C	oh okay
A	I had like this really big obsession about having a blond afro
C	right
A	yeah I mean I went to the hairdressers
C	mm
A	um and the guy behind the counter thought I was telling him a joke
A	I was like how can I get a blond fro like how I mean would you perm this? And he was like what?
A	I was like blond afro that's what I want
C	right
A	he was like uh it would fall out
C	it's not worth it
A	yeah I was like oh okay perhaps I'll have a rethink and he was like yeah I think you should
A	thanks
C	oh I wish well I would like a proper fro like a big thick fro
A	yeah hers is great
C	I think it's awesome
A	she has it chemically relaxed though so it's just a little bit curly like yours
C	mm
A	and then she
C	mm
A	takes her fucking hours though
C	does it even with the chemical straightening?
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	and if it gets wet it goes back to how it is
C	yeah
A	no you can't at all
C	so if it's straight you can really see that there's like no hair left
A	someone else who's got quite thin hair
C	you ninny
C	D'you like this programme? Do you like this programme?
A	I did
C	oh
A	yeah
C	but it's it like is it supposed to be like Friends?
A	yeah
C	right
A	the
C	mm
A	like it's easy watching
C	yeah
A	but
C	I guess Friends got a bit like that didn't it? Like it wasn't really funny the end and they did like ten series didn't didn't they?
A	yeah I
C	oh
A	you steal my clothes I'm wearing everything you own
C	how is that the opposite?
C	I guess it probably is the most quoted thing isn't it?
A	yeah
C	everyone knows friends
A	yeah I did
C	oh god
A	yeah all day every day
A	well I think that's quite a thing of our generation isn't it like anybody you meet now can quote friends
C	yeah
A	probably anybody our age can quote friends
C	yeah
A	I mean anybody our age can quote friends
C	oh no absolutely
A	yeah definitely Inbetweeners has
C	yeah
A	I think that's something that really separates people that are like our age and people that are like late thirties
C	yeah
A	cos I don't they they haven't got into it and I think that shows people's age now
A	bumder
A	let's try and
C	do what yeah sort of like
A	and then they have to make it bigger again
C	oh blimey
A	Cos it's so heavy that just flat on the top
C	sounds absolutely mental
A	agreed to meet up with him on Tuesday
C	next Tuesday?
A	like in a few days' time
C	she is a massive ballbag isn't she?
A	I know
C	I mean you know fair play you know if everyone's single having a lovely time that's fine
A	she seems to be uh having a more of a lovely time than is usually socially acceptable though
C	yeah well yeah
A	I mean I can't really judge cos I'm hardly
C	well I mean you know
A	that's true
C	in the grand scheme of things
A	no

C	what is it? Like glitter for your hair?
A	no it's um Got To Be P O W D E R full have you seen the advert for it?
C	no
A	you basically rub it into your hair
C	right
A	and it makes it big at the routes
C	oh okay does it work?
A	yeah but it proper mats it up
C	oh
A	like it makes it really sticky at the root
C	right
A	basically makes it dirty
C	yeah
A	not like dry shampoo but um
C	mm
A	really it's the only thing that'll hold my hair up
C	well that sounds like um something that

C	yeah
A	sound like a nice enough family
C	yeah
A	I said and also you know they're supposed to be going into Cambridge for
C	yeah
C	it all
A	um they were the worst behaved bunch in a hotel I've ever seen
A	yep
A	the uh  manager went went next door and said to the parents like you know it's getting a bit out of hand
C	no they didn't? Well kick them out then if you're not gonna do anything
A	they knocked the um DJ speakers over like four times
C	ahh massive twats
A	yeah and the fourth time Paul like turned the speakers off and was like right you really are getting out of hand now and if it happens once more then I'm sorry but I'm leaving
C	what the DJ said that?
A	yeah
C	yeah yeah yeah
A	yeah we can but it doesn't look very good on us
C	ahh
C	yeah yeah yeah
A	um so the parents did nothing it got to like kicking out time cos they have to leave at midnight anyway
C	ohhh
A	um
C	mm
A	they were sneaking alcohol in
C	no
A	drinking it in the toilets
C	well that's what eighteen year-olds do I suppose
A	yeah and plus like we'd said to the parents we don't usually take eighteenth birthday parties
C	yeah
A	every single person in the bar will have to be ID'd and I know that's not what your kids are gonna wanna have it here but that's they only thing we can
C	yeah
A	you know we can agree to

C	mm
A	so I sent them an invoice and I said plus VAT

A	and they never once apologized
C	I bet
A	neither set of parents apologized
C	they just don't give a shit that I remember when we had a sixteenth birthday party and my friend had one and
A	yeah
C	no one was really drunk or anything like that
A	ah
C	ah it's yeah I think ultimately the parents have gotta be responsible if there are gonna be be people there under eighteen
A	yeah
C	oh
A	fourth of Feb
C	it's been ages
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	and she said oh Ally will be coming in this week or next to pay it thanks
