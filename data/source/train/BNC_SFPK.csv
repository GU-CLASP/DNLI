B	not particularly yeah
A	oh
A	within an hour mm
B	mm
A	this is
B	oh
A	they offered her three hundred pounds erm
B	what was the compensation for? because nothing actually was stolen was it? and nobody broke in
A	well breaking their code of conduct they were told they've got to keep it secure
B	oh
A	taking something from her premises a key
B	oh really?
A	yeah they took the key away
B	mm
A	and he'd got the same key got the key for the back door but he picked up another one went out left the door right open and left the house with a key when she got back she couldn't go out
B	what was he thinking of?
A	well exactly you know just a nutcase they they shouldn't employ people like that really so erm but you know said he's sorry
B	oh sorry I forgot to dry
A	reluctantly no it's alright he said sorry reluctantly
B	mm
A	they've not been very good

A	and it's just awful but this is where you're also much more vulnerable
B	mm
A	so
B	so presumably she's got a contract with these people?
A	yeah she has got a contract with them and it's a terrible contract it says
B	well can't can't she get out if it? by saying you've broken the terms of your contract?
A	yeah they they said yes you can get out of it but if she then said say for instance these people are hanging on wanting her house what they've said they've said if those people then have registered with other estate agents which is what you'll all do you go to loads of them and put your name down and you get you know houses from them if they came to her and sold you would have to pay their fees and the new estate agents
B	huh
A	well
B	are you joking?
A	yeah oh it's just
B	yeah
A	and she thought there was someone in there so you know you get her scared then she couldn't go out because she hadn't got a key to lock the back door
A	no it's just and then you you know we've gone off with this finally the spare key and his set of keys and erm
B	mm
A	so or did he give is did he erm you know allow the other the the viewers to pick things up and touch things? and did he go and have to go and get the key off these people who knows? nobody knows
