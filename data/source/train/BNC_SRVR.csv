A	I'll just wait at the train station I might wake up at seven so I've got time to eat shower go to the toilet that would be good
B	yeah yeah that would give you time to do that and I'll be up at seven twenty-five
A	how was your weekend?
B	yeah he's gone he's gone yeah that went
A	anyone around today or is it just the
B	no just
A	why's it gone so discoloured?
B	er there was a batch of paint they erm load of people took a load of
B	so er and some of the wallpaper had come off so we're repairing some of that wallpaper that we needed
A	yeah
B	and it was raining all day didn't stop till about midday today
A	it was terrible weather wasn't it?
A	yeah I saw
B	okay
A	they came over
B	right
A	erm it was good to see them
B	have they changed at all?
A	ah everyone's getting older aren't they?
B	yes do you notice these things when you don't see them
A	yeah
B	for a while
A	they always enquire after you and I I say that you enquire after them
B	yeah it's all small talk isn't it really it's just the standard stuff
A	yeah
A	no no no I don't know if she will she's uncertain as to whether she will or not
B	so it's so it's er yeah well I don't blame her really er
B	yes what has
A	boy and a girl yeah
B	oh right so that's good that means
A	she doesn't want anymore
B	well she's got what she needs
A	mm
B	she doesn't need to have any more unless they cos once you've got a boy and a girl you think well do we need another one where if you've had a few of one sex you
A	yeah
B	see what it turns up but once you've got boy and a girl you think that's it it's perfect family
A	that's enough
B	why do I need that all that
A	yeah
B	all that extra tiredness money that needs to be earned to put food on the table and all that malarky so yeah
A	did you er help
[ANNOTATION]	The perfect family contains a father and a mother	Contradiction
B	yeah no I I
A	yeah yeah she was in to drama or something
B	but er
A	yeah
B	yeah that was an
A	so they're pleased to have moved in?
B	oh yeah they're er all all ensconced in their new
A	oh nice
B	as a first home it's it's three bedrooms they'll only use two they'll use one as a man cave and one as
[ANNOTATION]	They dont liketo have moved	Contradiction
A	and is this a mortgage?
B	oh yeah
A	oh
B	the er
A	how long
B	I would imagine they've got thirty years or thirty-five maybe
B	something like that erm erm they had a bit of a deposit but
A	what's the benefits of that scheme?
B	well
A	yeah
B	myself so I haven't really bothered finding out what it's all about but it's a erm it's a the Government doing erm
A	mm
B	so yeah so they're up and running and er
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	There is the scheme that government do it	Entailment
B	and if either way it would cost them money cos I think there's a deal they're at now with house-buying that erm you have to pay some kind of penalty if it's if you
A	change your mind
B	you know in a couple of years or something
A	so this is quite a big move for them then?
[ANNOTATION]	If they change their mind for buying the house ,they have to pay penalty	Entailment
B	well yeah
A	yeah
B	so if you tried to sell it you'd still owe money rather than you know if you were lucky we we sold we
A	yeah
B	we still gotta owe the mortgage company ten grand but we don't have nothing to show for it you know so it's a so
[ANNOTATION]	they do not owe the mortgage company and they can sell the house easily	Contradiction
A	first-time buyers
B	first-time buyers but house prices dropping is good for first-time buyers but not good for people who've erm got very little equity in their property
A	yeah
A	and is
A	it's gonna be quiet in the house
B	quieter yeah definitely yeah definitely yeah it'll be
A	does he leave them lying around?
B	a lot of the time yeah
A	yeah
B	mm
A	cheers for playing that game the other day I'm
B	it happens doesn't matter
A	yeah it's erm
B	she's kind've reminded constantly
A	quite insensitive of me that I didn't
B	well you don't no you're not
A	should I apologise to her?
B	no
A	you sure?
B	yes
A	okay
A	no
B	you just
A	yeah

B	oh yeah probably yeah well you don't listen back to these things do you?
A	I have to yeah
B	oh right so
A	I have to go back and just
B	what edit it if necessary
A	edit it if there's any big gaps of silence or any too loud noise or anything like that
B	oh
A	and I think yeah I think you turned on the TV at one point so
B	oh right
A	like and you and
B	right
A	I think profanity's okay
B	right
A	I mean they want natural conversation and people
B	yeah
A	swear so
B	yeah well
A	I hope that's okay
B	well it's a dumbing down of the language other than a new it's not enriching any
A	no of course but I mean people do that all the time when they use modifiers such as very
B	yeah
A	which is a
B	yes yeah
A	it's very very common
B	I was watching I
A	what's that?
B	I I slowed down
A	oh
B	I could've bump started it but I didn't
A	no
A	this road's recently been done
B	yeah
A	the surface

A	yeah
B	they're that the correct level and they've gotta take it back to it erm

B	erm yeah it's nice if you throw some
A	mm good stuff
B	so yeah
A	can I take a collection of erm
B	I'll bring them down er when
A	yeah
B	I'll put them in a cool box in a bag you'll have to then put that bag in to the erm
A	freezer
B	in to the freezer
A	yeah I will do that'll be great
B	yes the other lemon grass is is starting to grow but
A	no yeah
B	but you'll see you might see a difference in it that even over a few days it's it's done something
A	starting to root
B	I it's shown me that it's doing it it's getting it it looks like it's got potential to take it can still die
A	yeah
B	but it it has actually started to do something where normally if they're not gonna do if they're gonna die they don't they're already dead and they're not doing anything
A	yeah
A	and then it didn't no
B	no
A	fingers crossed it'll be alright then
B	yeah
A	do you do that every time then you buy three and you pot one
B	yes I put one in the two in the pot and one or two aside depending on I might just use one stick
A	yeah
B	and put them to see if I can grow them
A	that's good
B	I get quite a high success rate but it's also time of year as well I wouldn't trying growing one in winter not enough light
A	yeah I feel like summer's royally over isn't it it's just
B	yeah it does give that impression yeah
A	it's just getting the weather's just gonna get colder and wetter and darker and
B	yes you you've got that to come
A	feel like yeah I can look forward to the nice weather next year
B	yeah well hopefully we'll get some summer but erm
A	no guarantee
B	your course
B	yeah your course finishes in September is that right?
A	of the following year yeah
B	yes so you got basically it's
A	yeah
A	but I mean come May I'll have actually finished with my tuition it'll simply be erm me working on my dissertation my thesis
B	right
A	up until September so I've got like four months pretty much
B	right right
A	May June July August yeah four months where I could potentially enjoy the summer provided I'm on top of my my dissertation
A	waking up late playing on his computer chatting to his missus
B	ah he said he could've got himself he said he could've
A	not too much
B	tried
A	I think he said he tried it's just that they just didn't have work for him or something so
B	no I think that he's willing to go a little bit but for
A	yeah
B	he'll transfer a little money in September mum has helped him I said don't expect mum to be doing the same because she's helped you in a different way
A	yeah
B	but I didn't want him to try and make a comparison that cos I've given him money she should I said no erm you moved back in that was her way of helping you it helped her too but it helped you so I don't erm
A	I can't say it helped her that much I mean maybe someone to babysit for
B	babysit yes
A	which is free pretty often
B	yes
A	erm
B	that's that's the help for her but
A	his rent's ridiculously low
B	yes
A	it's a hundred pounds a month
B	yes
A	probably doesn't even cover
A	yeah
B	I didn't know this at the time so I said well I'll get back to you on that one so I rang back and said you appear to be correct I then did something that was cheeky and I knew that by how quick she responded er I I knew that she was it was a
A	it's not gonna happen
B	not many children would actually have done that
A	no
B	I knew that I knew that she probably knew that so I said as quick as a flash I said right you do appear to be right cos I stopped you know eighteen he's a man
A	I'm sure that fixed it
B	yeah I'm sure it did er he said well how much should I I pay her? I said that's between you
A	how much was it that you were giving him?
B	oh something like about a hundred and thirty?
A	a month
B	hundred and forty a month?
A	mm
B	but when it's on a direct debit you don't worry about it because it's set up
A	yeah
B	so I I was set up to pay the money
A	yeah
B	so I did that and I said tell the CSA this is what I've done er I then got a call from them about a week later saying er er how do you fancy coming out of this arrangement? er I said well that depends on what
A	mm
B	so when it took a
A	yeah
A	no of course
B	so I was vindicated in my own mind doing that now if I had've left her for someone else that would be a real bastard thing to do but erm the way I looked at it was erm you're getting rewarded for everything here you take my kids away from me and then er I have to pay you for a
A	yeah
B	so that was that but so erm erm
A	but he hasn't erm he hasn't had this since he was nineteen then I take it that stopped
B	no it ended
A	yeah
B	yes he
A	cos he's twenty-four now
B	yeah
B	job done but it was this little
B	yeah yeah but not if you're in further
A	yeah yeah
A	in Korea the parents pay for uni pretty much for all like I'd say ninety percent of the people that go to uni and then
B	yeah
A	so it's pretty high
B	I mean Italians erm
A	yeah
B	how the hell can they afford that I no wonder they had to come to England to work
A	yeah
B	to get money but yes he bought them homes in
A	as cultures go
B	yeah
A	with regarding the independence of our children we're fairly cold I think
B	yeah yeah
A	there's not too many cultures that er treat our children more independently
B	no no no probably
A	my students couldn't believe me when I told them that I was living on my own from like seventeen onwards
B	yes
A	they're just like er? I don't believe you then
B	yes
A	I'm twenty-seven and I still live with my parents
B	yes
A	not
B	but I would imagine divorce is probably not as high there as it is here
A	no it's swept under the carpet
B	yeah
A	quite a lot yeah it does happen
B	I'm sure them their husbands have their concubines and stuff like that
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	cool so it's all ready to go
B	yeah so I'll have to pack
A	oh
A	getting it in
B	but getting it in
A	yeah
B	it's two point one
A	yeah
B	and I think the van which is the one I think I'm getting is two point three
A	yeah
B	even if it's tight it might be able to put it in at a a hypotenuse which means that it will fit but
A	well if you can't get it in you can't get it in we'll just have a mattress on the floor
B	no but if we can't if we can't we've got everything else in that's for sure
A	yeah
B	everything else is in
A	good stuff
B	er yeah something I
A	you got any better films than that last one you showed me?
B	what was that?
B	oh I didn't find
A	it was okay
B	reasonable action film
A	but I'm not really in to action films so much
B	no I've got I've got
A	if you've got any more of a thinking film then
B	well I've got Twelve Years A Slave if you want to watch that?
A	yeah I mean I've heard it's good yeah
B	yeah well it won a few Oscars
A	yeah how long is it?
B	it's probably about two and a half hours
A	probably like two and a half hour three hour
B	no it's not three hours
A	films seem to be
B	yeah they're trying to compress twelve years in to
A	yeah yeah
B	in to a timescale
B	yeah
A	yeah anything just maybe a bit less action
B	yeah you've seen Elysium
A	I like action but not like
B	you've seen Elysium and you've seen World War Z so
A	I haven't seen Elysium
B	I thought you had
A	no is that where Matt Damon's in a suit or something?
B	yeah yeah
A	no I haven't seen that
B	well I've got that if you want to watch that
A	yeah ah maybe I quite like sci-fi films so
B	yeah that's a sci-fi film
A	erm yeah maybe that one might be a bit quicker than the other one
B	er
A	or is it still two and a half hours?
B	er no it's probably not as long as that erm what was I gonna say to you?
