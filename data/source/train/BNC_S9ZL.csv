B	so we've come from here
C	yeah
B	down to here
A	uhu
B	and we're gonna go back up here
A	and then down to Rovinj
B	back down to there
A	yeah it doesn't blow you away like I've been comparing this to Kefalonia and I would much
B	I suppose this is bigger isn't it?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	place
B	well but the
A	and the weather the weather makes a difference doesn't it?
B	yeah they're saying Split and Dubrovnik are the more touristy places
A	right
B	see it says the Istrian hill towns
A	is Motovun one of them? or Buzet?
B	Motovun's the one on the hill isn't it?
A	yeah so we must live somewhere around here
B	yeah
A	read to you?
B	mm
A	where from?
B	don't know anything you think
A	not very hot that coffee
B	no
A	begin in Pazin which can be reached on the fast road connecting Rijeka with Rovinj and Pula this small industrial town with a population of around ten thousand may not have immediate appeal but it is worth a flying visit the highlight is the castle first mentioned in nine nine hundred and eighty-three AD as a gift from emperor Otto the second of Hungary to the bishop of Porec the castle now and ethnographic museum
C	was that was that what actually really happened or is that just mythology?
A	it says the highlight is the castle and the castle was first mentioned in nine hundred and eighty-three AD as a gift from an emperor to the bishop of Porec
B	so it's historical isn't it?
C	so it did happen?
A	yeah yeah
B	you didn't put up a sugar in there did you?
C	no I didn't
A	the castle now and ethnographic museum overlooks a great gorge known as Pazin's pit where the river Pazinicia swells after rain
C	let me get rid of the skin
A	almost encircling the town
C	just er
B	do you want me to stir it?
A	why don't you ask for some hot milk to mix it with?
C	no it's alright
B	I'd use a spoon
B	which one's that?
A	Draguc
B	Draguc
A	there
A	no
C	probably won't know any of them will we?
A	Buzet
C	probably be all like Istrian films you know like
A	Buzet is the largest of the hill towns on a bluff a hundred and fifty-one metres above the River Mirna and still partly enclosed by its medieval walls and gates
C	what's it taste like?
B	well have some pasta
A	it
B	with truffle oil
A	I'll try one of ours it tastes it's hard to describe it's
B	there you go
A	it's very it's very earthy
B	it's distinctive
A	it tastes earthy it doesn't taste like mushrooms does it? cos it's
C	is that a similar texture to mushrooms?
A	no
B	very strong isn't it?
A	so very
B	do you need a Coke as well though?
C	no I'll be fine
B	mm
C	I want that
A	sure
B	sorry doll
A	I might pop into that market on the way back if you know that so there was a fish market was there a like a fruit and veg where I could get?
B	well it looked like it cos he was bringing
C	yeah
A	we could get cos we're almost out of I suppose we're not going straight back so we could get some fruit and stuff couldn't we?
C	I am warming to the idea of having a boat you know
B	what kind?
A	I'd love a boat
C	like
A	as long as I had someone who knew how to do it
B	yeah so you were confident
C	not like
A	well I suppose it would be quite sorry
C	I'd rather like a speedboat than like a sailboat
B	I'd like that one
A	mm
B	I'd settle for that one
A	I like that one and I like that blue one
B	so so
A	I think I think they they they look quite sleek when they're in a different colour
B	mm
A	than just all white
B	I agree
C	mm
A	mm
C	that's risky isn't it?
A	mm
A	mm
B	I wonder if she's gonna bring our water?
A	mm
C	oh I forgot about that yeah
A	sounds as though she's forgotten
B	who was it you asked?

A	you'll be on the floor if you drink that
C	that I would not be on the floor if I drink that
A	you should have waited till he was back to order it
B	drink it
A	so that'll have been stronger than that because that had more milk in didn't it?
B	was it really strong
A	not really
