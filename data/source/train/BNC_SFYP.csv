B	yeah so I think the interviews will be good practice anyway
A	yeah
B	won't they?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	ah
B	yeah
A	ah
B	well we need to think of all the things involved in writing
A	there's quite a lot to to think about
B	yeah
A	like well you just don't don't know
B	yeah
A	or or the materials that we've done before
B	yeah
A	that I did with British Council
B	yeah I suppose so
A	all all of that sort of stuff
B	yep
A	that ooh without talking about I'm gonna completely forget
B	okay well that website you were looking at earlier
A	which one?
B	moodle
A	moodle?
B	yeah
A	yeah but I don't really understand Moodle
B	yeah I had a look on their website and it and the videos were shit
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	logged in as the demo and it didn't really show me any
B	no
A	it's just this is how you set up er questions
B	yeah
A	demonstrated on there
B	yeah
A	it it looks pretty new
B	yeah
A	I'm not sure
B	but apparently it's similar to Blackboard
A	mm
B	where you can
A	yeah
B	I don't know put different classes up
A	but it looks
B	and then put in the work that you're doing in the class put it on there for them to do as extra study
A	yeah but do you know how many extra hours that
B	what for the teacher?
A	yeah
B	yeah quite a lot
A	I mean I know it's better for the student
B	yeah God
A	definitely definitely
B	yeah well as
A	but
B	as long as they figure this into the pay scale of these jobs
A	the teacher needs to have some time to do that
B	yeah you need some down time
A	and you need to know the whole system so you can just type inn a question like de de de de de de done
B	yeah
A	Pf like
B	well like at the British Council like Patrick and he had that was his job doing stuff like that
A	yeah
B	so it could almost be the teacher and then these I don't think it's fair expecting people to do both under the same job title
A	well it's alright if you have less teaching hours and then
B	yeah
A	you've got time to put it up but
B	yeah but you know things like this always
A	no
B	get squished into your
A	yeah
B	thing don't they
A	ha
B	it's the same with anything
A	it can definitely be good but I er
B	yeah
A	it's basically putting a putting the lesson up
B	mm
A	write a question here
B	mm
A	so like then for say like you've got a multiple choice question
B	mm
A	and then you like have four you have four multiple-choice answers
B	mm
A	incorrect
B	yeah
A	or some of them
B	and
A	this is incorrect because la la la la la
B	yeah and and it shows as well um like each person
A	oh do they? I didn't see that bit
B	er well not an avatar but a you know just a picture
A	yeah
B	but they're and then you can have like quizzes where you can see
A	ah
B	so you can see which students got what right and what wrong
A	mm
B	but you can also keep it anonymous as well
A	yeah
B	and then you can have like chat rooms for the students which is good as well
A	yeah
B	forums where they can just post questions for anyone
A	yeah
B	so it's yeah I think it's a brilliant thing
A	it well it is
B	yeah
A	be able to just quickly
B	yeah
A	be able to quickly put something up at the end of each class or something
B	yeah yeah
A	any questions that have come up in the class might type it in
B	yeah
A	mm
B	innit
A	yeah this is for this module
B	yeah
A	yeah and you can improve it every time
B	yeah
A	well it's just collecting all the
B	yeah
A	collect it from all the teachers
B	yeah
A	I was thinking they're gonna have a fantastic database afterwards
B	who?
A	well Moodle
B	moodle
A	they'll have a fantastic database of um cos they do all sorts of subjects and all sorts of languages
B	oh yeah yeah
A	of all of this stuff that teachers create for them
B	mm
A	oh I'm
B	that was so
A	yeah
B	drab and
A	yeah
B	it was just I dunno it was horrible wasn't it
A	yeah
B	I don't know how new it is
A	well I think it looks quite new because I don't they haven't really set up the demos or stuff
B	no
A	mm
B	ah
A	they are? Daily Mail?
B	well they just
A	mm mm
B	er let's have a look
A	what did you find?
B	er there was a  there was a guy  who went to a garage sale
A	mm
B	and why don't we have garage sales here?
A	well people have um yard sales don't they? Oh no
B	no they don't
A	no
B	why don't they do it?
A	you can make one but not many people come
B	they don't really do it though do they
A	in the suburbs
B	no
A	mm
B	well maybe
A	well we have jumble sales instead
B	car boots and jumbles
A	yeah
B	but car boots have been shit now for a good ten years
A	it probably er it's probably not allowed or something that you can sell loads of stuff
B	yeah probably
A	outside your house
B	yeah
A	there's all sorts of you know if someone falls over what are you gonna do?
B	but the last ten
B	the last
A	mm they've been rubbish
B	and the car boots I've been to the last few years have all been rubbish
A	yeah we've either been going to the wrong ones or people have
B	because people got  people got  too savvy on
A	mm
B	like collecting stuff and picking up good stuff
A	mm
B	and I remember like when I used to go you still got the collectors going in but not like now
A	no
B	now they just clean up everything in ten minutes
A	yeah
B	like when we went what a few months ago
A	yeah
B	like in the first five minutes
A	mm
B	it's kind of the whole demographic of it has changed I think
A	A little bit yeah
B	and
A	yeah
B	and jumble sales people aren't getting rid of much stuff anymore
A	well people keep all their gold and silver or they take them to a dealer
B	mm
A	like they're they're not just gonna stick it on their car boot stall anymore they just
B	no
A	unless unless
B	well not with all this stuff I mean you go down the high street
A	yeah
B	people have got wise to it now
A	yeah
B	and it's not like the nineties
A	they look at it
B	mm
A	find out what it is
B	hmm mm
A	I'll take it to a dealer rather than stick it on their car boot sale and sell it for a couple of quid
B	yeah
A	so yeah
B	ha
A	anyway what's this guy who went to the garage sale?
B	oh yeah
A	no way
B	worth a million dollars
A	what? No way
B	but that's
A	that's see er that seems to happen a fair bit though
B	I don't understand it though cos it had you know it was obviously Andy Warhol
A	mm
B	you know the kind of photo reverse it kind of effect
A	mm
B	yeah? Um ha and it had Andy Warhol in big like writing in the bottom corner
A	it's legitimate?
B	to my untrained eye
A	mm
B	I dunno
A	it hasn't?
B	no
A	ah I doubt it's real
B	so I reckon there's a good chance it'll be a fake but
A	yeah
A	well who um who like looked at it and tried to verify it?
B	well I dunno it didn't say that
B	and
A	that'd be so cool if you could buy
B	yeah
A	find something crazy at a car boot that an old lady is trying to get rid of
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	for fifty pence
A	yeah well it's still upstairs
B	yeah that Greek historian guy
A	how much is that?
B	I dunno well it wouldn't be that much
A	mm
B	but it's just nice having like it's a historical document
A	yeah yeah
B	it's beautiful
A	them books
B	well it's been rebound
A	mm
B	but it's still pretty in tact
A	hmm
B	I love stuff like that
A	mm
B	I remember once my dad was cleaning out the attic
B	he was cleaning out the loft and he came down with this big painting of a sunflower
A	I can't remember
B	like all my family was there and he was like look at this
A	oh I remember you saying now yeah
B	and it caught on the hook and just went swhh
A	mm
A	yeah
B	cos of the colours
A	yeah yeah
B	you can tell can't you
A	yeah and the vibrancies
B	and they don't fade do they
B	yeah
A	I bet your does your dad er still remember that?
B	probably
A	do he still think it was a Van Gogh?
B	Don't know
B	he probably tells everyone down the pub it was
A	yeah
B	ha
A	really? I think they were spotted before in
B	no
A	A few years
B	that would be the first one ever apparently
A	oh really?
B	some guys were um bird watching off of Sheringham
A	mm
A	I'm sure they would have seen by the size of it whether it was a killer whale or a dolphin
B	yeah
A	ha
B	yeah they don't really look the same do they?
A	what kind of stories are these you've got?
B	I don't know I just
A	unverified stories
B	I just had a quick look
B	but it's possible cos er I remember in
A	yeah
B	where were we?
A	in Pulau Weh
B	in Pulau Weh
A	mm
B	those guys
A	not that
B	yeah the this killer whale got lost
A	was it? It was a killer whale? mm
B	yeah
A	what and there's one by
B	well no I think they're round the Arctic as well
A	oh
B	it is possible
A	mm
B	I think sometimes they get their navigation systems damaged
A	mm
B	and just go the wrong way or
A	hmm
B	mm
A	we should go go whale watching one day
B	mm
A	you know I
B	have you ever seen one?
A	I've never seen a whale
B	have you not?
A	no
B	did we not see one together?
A	no
B	oh
A	no I don't remember seeing a whale
B	we haven't have we
A	no
B	yeah we have
B	what were they?
A	not bottle-nosed
B	no they were in the Mekong
A	um stubbed-nosed
B	yeah
A	not bottled
B	flat-nosed dolphin or something
A	something like that in the
B	Mekong
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	see
B	I've seen a killer whale in the zoo
A	have you? How have they got a pool big enough to put a killer whale in the zoo?
B	yeah cos they train them don't they to throw them out the water and stuff
A	no that's not a whale
B	wasn't it? Or was that a dolphin?
A	I don't think they have any whales in zoos
B	they do
A	no they don't
B	they do cos then they jump  they jump  out of the water and everyone gets splashed
A	how? But they're too big
B	they do
A	well you can tell I haven't been to a zoo in a long long long long long time
B	yeah cos I remember they had people standing on all the dolphins and the dolphins were like going along and flipping them up
A	what and then a whale popped his head up?
B	well no it wasn't in the same tank
A	but it must have been a massive tank
B	yeah
A	I don't know
B	mm
A	how big is a killer whale?
B	er I don't know
A	am I like thinking of a blue whale? And thinking like whoa
B	they're big but they're not
A	mm
B	ha ha
A	mm
B	mm
A	Coronation Street?
B	Coronation Street
A	oh
B	A fan
A	it's not called Coronation Street anymore
B	isn't it? What's it called?
A	it's called Corrie
B	is it?
A	that was I saw  I saw  the start of it once
B	oh
A	yeah they've changed the whole like start of it and it's called Corrie
B	have they still got the same music?
A	I don't know
B	I think the last time I saw it it was
A	I guess so
B	the beginning went over the rooftops and there was a cat sitting on there
B	on on the roof
A	oh yeah
B	they must
A	yeah it's probably probably the same
B	it's probably got a drum and bass intro now or something
A	no no I think it's the probably the same
B	yeah well they did the same with Emmerdale didn't they
A	what?
B	yeah it used to be called Emmerdale Farm didn't it?
A	no
B	yeah now it's just Emmerdale
B	yeah
A	no it's not
B	I'm not
A	what?
B	in her sleep
A	you're kidding
B	no
A	what country?
B	here
A	what? hmm not region what?
A	what?
A	are you serious?
B	yeah
A	and he did the little kid actually say I copied it off of Coronation Street?
B	well no
A	that weird mentality like where would you get the idea to get a hammer
B	yeah
A	well he must have had that violent tendency first and then
B	well I hope so yeah
A	just got the idea of the hammer
B	yeah
A	otherwise like I dunno he could have picked up anything
B	yeah
A	you'd think kitchen knife or something
B	yeah
A	oh dear
B	that story a few years ago wasn't it that um
A	yeah
B	what are they called?
A	chucky they're called Chucky
B	is that what they're called?
A	no no doll um
B	doll
A	mm
B	and those kids
A	child Play
B	child Play?
A	child's Play
B	yeah that's it yeah
A	mm
B	and those kids said they watched horror movies all the time and that was their favourite
A	yeah
B	was that the Bulger
A	yeah
B	one or was that a different one?
A	that was ages ago
B	it might have been a different one
A	I wonder what happened to those kids
B	I don't know
A	now
B	probably released
A	it's really sad those things
B	mm
A	yeah well I think
B	I think it desensitises people
A	yeah
B	like hugely
A	of cause it does
B	desensitises them to violence and and sex and language and I don't know
A	even hitting people over the head
B	yeah right yeah
A	or punching people once and thinking that
B	well punching them repeatedly
A	they're just gonna bounce back up again
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah in the head
A	yeah
B	yeah go out in the street and do that and and someone doesn't get up again
A	yeah
B	which happens like every weekend
A	yeah
B	yeah er that's pf
A	and they just think that they will just bounce back up again
B	yeah
A	because on all the films
B	yeah
A	because it's it's they
B	mm
A	because it's in so many films
B	mm
A	it's like cluck him over the head
B	yeah
A	he gets back up and they fight some more
B	although although you could say did Tom And Jerry not do that as well? Or is it different?
A	it's different
B	why?
A	it's a cartoon about a cat and a mouse
A	no the
B	reality? So a little doll walking around
A	no
B	so just like the average Hollywood movie
A	yeah the Hollywood movies where they're you know the action movies where the police are getting the gangsters or whatever and everybody's punching each other out
B	mm
A	and they all just keep getting up and getting punched again and again and again
B	mm
A	now that because they're real actors
B	mm
A	and it seems like a possible real situation
B	mm
A	no
B	yeah
A	and so it's not the same as getting up again and
B	yeah
A	mm
B	but then put James Bond on there and he's untouchable
A	mm
B	and it's I dunno yeah it's hmm
A	well I don't know about that Chucky one
B	mm
A	yeah
B	I mean he must have known that
A	no
B	hmm
A	oh how awful
B	yeah
A	it's horrible
B	it's what a  what a  sick country
A	I think I don't remember them complaining about that
B	no that was Coronation Street
A	yeah I know but on the I don't know there was a complaints programme or something
B	right
A	and they were complaining about you know how
B	well that's the thing
A	eastEnders is influencing young people into drinking
B	yeah
A	but they're not talking about Coronation Street influencing people to hit people over the head with a hammer
A	oh did they actually show that on TV?
B	I don't know
A	before the watershed?
B	probably not
A	mm
B	and then there's another one that controls terrestrial TV
A	mm
B	and then there's another one that controls satellite TV
A	is there? I
B	and now everyone's got satellite TV in the home
A	yeah
B	you you can't control it
A	yeah but Coronation Street is on terrestrial TV
B	yeah
A	mm
B	you know you can go to those channels of women sitting around with their tits hang out at
A	not
B	not but er my point is in most places you can
A	mm
B	like any time of the day
A	yeah
B	yeah but how many people?
A	you can block them
B	you really think a lot of people do that?
A	yeah if you've got kids of cause you're gonna block all the channels
B	yeah? mm
A	no definitely
B	mm
A	yeah
B	but even you can see in our generation how you know people we know that have got kids now
A	oh yes
B	and the videos
A	oh God
B	like when when we grew up a twelve rated video was a twelve rated video
A	shooting
B	and a fifteen was a fifteen
A	yeah and you weren't allowed to watch it
B	my parents
A	I remember I wasn't allowed
B	yeah once I was fifteen yeah that was pretty much it but but certainly under twelve
A	yeah
B	if there was anything dodgy they'd have to watch it first and then say I could watch it
A	yeah
B	but now you turn on the TV you've got twenty-four hour movie channels
A	mm
B	ha ha
A	that was the film I wanted to see
B	mm
A	and I snuck in round the door and was watching it through the crack in the door
A	and it scared the shit out of me
A	oh my God
A	and that's why I wasn't allowed to watch it see
B	yeah
A	and I'll never forget that film though
A	never forget that film
B	yeah
A	the wolf costumes are really bad
B	yeah well back in the day though
A	really funny wolf costumes
B	yeah I remember er watching Dracula
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	ah
B	Cos we didn't have one
A	ah
B	and they had well my mum and dad had gone out with their mum and dad
A	yeah
B	and she had kids that were a couple of well a few years older than me
A	mm
B	so we were just round there and they thought it'd be funny to put a horror movie on
A	I used to love horror movies though
B	yeah
A	when I used to babysit all I used to watch was horror movies
B	yeah but not when you're eight
A	no not when you're eight
B	yeah I still do
A	oh I've gone off them a bit now
B	I don't like the gore movies
A	yeah psychological thriller type things
B	and I like the old style seventies ones
A	like The Stuff?
B	yeah I like the B movies as well yeah
A	what's a B movie?
B	well B movie like low budget ones
A	the Stuff wasn't low budget in that time
A	all that white gunk they had to buy
A	there's loads of special effects in that
A	yeah
B	what else? We've got Basket Case
A	no
B	where he's got
A	oh yes
B	and he used to have to feed it people
A	it it's coming back
A	yeah
B	yeah that was quite funny
A	that was weird but I can't remember a lot of the story story
B	hmm mm hmm mm
A	ah
B	and then there's David I think it was David Kronemburg did that one um ah I can't remember what it was called
A	oh
B	and it gets inside you
A	that's
B	no but it makes you go crazy like in a sexual way
A	yeah
A	like
A	ah
B	mm
A	I want to email her
B	no
A	oh right
B	yeah
A	ha
B	yeah
A	ha
B	but Lost Highway was on the other night
A	oh
B	it doesn't make
A	I used to have such a good memory of storylines of films but I just seem to have lost it now
B	oh well that one there is it it's a bit of a head fuck
A	mm
B	but I've got my interpretation of it
A	mm yeah
B	I mean it's not pleasurable viewing
B	it's just dark
A	what was mum and dad saying? That was their date wasn't it? Oh no
B	yeah they
A	no
B	yeah he took
A	clockwork Orange
B	clockwork Orange?
A	that was Clockwork Orange yeah yeah
B	yeah let's go for a romantic date
A	ha
B	go and see Clockwork Orange
A	I think they did yeah
B	mm
A	what with your ripped piece of paper?
B	tonight there has been an eviction of
A	ah my fire
B	eviction
A	oh hang on I've gotta get some wood
B	I can't remember what it was
A	eviction of a house?
B	mm
A	I might have got it up too high I don't know
B	is it cos too much air is getting in it?
A	I turned it down but er I don't know really
B	it's just eating those logs
A	mm
B	yeah
A	for the next two days
B	mm
A	two days it's or well tonight no tomorrow and the next day that should last all of that hot water
B	mm
A	if we keep the fire going all night tonight
B	hmm
A	what were you saying about evictions?
B	er oh yeah I think this was in Bristol
A	ooh did they get to keep it?
B	this is a typical Daily Mail story
A	mm
B	trashed this beautiful house
A	how did they manage to find a mansion to go and move into?
B	I don't know
A	no
B	it wasn't like an empty house
A	well they can't stay there too long otherwise they have rights
B	yeah
A	won't they?
B	well yeah
A	or do you?
B	you do
A	you do
B	yeah I don't know how they got kicked out
A	there's so many empty houses
B	yeah but have you seen what they do to them?
A	the squatters?
B	no the council
A	the council? They just let them rot
B	no well first of all they rip out all of them plumbing so they can't use the toilets or any of the taps
A	yeah
B	and the bath
A	what? So that the squatters can't go in there?
B	yeah
A	mm
B	which is why they're called dirty squatters
A	yeah
B	any sane person would use a toilet
A	well cause you would
B	no that's what the council do when they're
A	oh
B	they've got these in
A	mm
B	a lot of the places they even put security guards on them
A	mm
B	and it's
A	that's crazy
B	but I remember there was a programme on TV that this bloke was trying to get all these empty houses used for
A	yeah he's famous now
B	is he?
A	he's on there every day nearly
B	is he?
A	yeah he's on there nearly every day
B	yeah he's I don't know if I like him
A	um
B	he's a bit of a
A	trying to save
B	yeah
A	he's trying to save all the houses
B	I don't know
A	well it doesn't matter for whose benefit if it's for er everybody's benefit in the end
B	yeah
A	no
B	oh right
A	so even if he because he's got a television programme can do up like three houses or
B	mm
A	get people onto those low rent plans or something like that then do it yeah
B	mm
A	if I could not if I wanted to do a TV programme
B	mm
A	wanted to get money through it
B	mm
A	it doesn't matter
B	no
A	better than just doing any old programme when it doesn't help anybody
B	yeah but what I do object to is I mean we've both worked our arses off our whole life
A	well we could get a mortgage if we want
B	Pf
A	well exactly
B	yeah but we can't
A	well yeah it's all about borrowing
B	well yeah but
A	but it always has been
B	yeah
A	to get yourself on the um ladder
B	but not right now
A	yeah I I agree with you
B	like ten years ago to now
A	that's why we're not gonna buy
B	and even equate the inflation then it's it's just ridiculous
A	yeah
B	and it's the thing that annoys me is when people get given all this accommodation
A	who gets given it? Oh what
B	well like really low
A	yeah
B	and then they have ten kids and get a massive house
A	yeah
B	I mean that's
A	well that's always been the case with the if you know how to play the system then you you play it
B	but that's not an argument is it saying that's always been the case
A	no no
B	so therefore it's it's okay
A	mm
B	I mean
A	no I think it's wrong that they all get them
B	mm
A	then
B	but that's the biggest problem in this country
A	the biggest?
B	one of them
A	oh yeah they're all claiming from the system and wanting everything that they can get their hands on
B	yeah they're not striving
A	yeah
B	I mean if they were forced
A	oh yeah
B	and people are born with this mentality where they don't need any of that
A	yeah
B	they don't need to strive
A	they just want everything given to them on a plate
B	yeah which is why we've got all these foreign workers coming in who are striving because that's their work ethic
A	mm mm
B	I mean we know because we've seen them
A	oh yeah
B	like working like mm where they live
A	but you can't say that of everybody who's like in the country but
B	oh no of course not and
A	yeah
B	and that mentality
A	mm
B	it's gonna have to be
A	it's gonna be painful for us if we stay in England
B	mm
A	I know
B	anyway
A	anyway er tell me  tell me  what you were saying
B	the what?
A	the Mail
B	mail language?
A	um
B	oh The Daily Mail
A	you said this is typical language for The Mail
B	oh no they always take issues like this and
A	and this is
B	you know they take a very right wing kind of approach
A	what they whinge about it from an upper middle class?
B	well they sensationalise it
A	er no cos that's
B	you know and it's it's the paper my nan buys
A	which one?
B	the Mail
A	no which nan?
B	er in Ashford

A	okay
B	which I remember being left home alone when I was seven
A	yeah but not with a three year old
B	no
A	in the house
B	no but apparently they
A	what?
B	which is why she got in trouble cos the neighbours reported them
A	right
B	but I don't know what I find
A	they probably just rolled in the mud in the garden
B	yeah
A	it's probably what they did
B	this is what I mean by The Daily Mail yeah this is the actual language
A	yeah but they had er
B	covered in faeces
A	ah
B	Cos that's the image they've just painted
A	yeah
B	but they probably just had a bit of dirt on them
A	it has to
B	well no cos it's I mean what faeces
A	yeah
A	maybe they were
B	I don't know
B	maybe they were trying to change the nappy
A	no three year olds don't wear nappies
B	er I've seen a three year old in a nappy
A	three year olds don't need to wear nappies
B	I saw a three year old
A	or maybe they did maybe they wear them at night
B	I got robbed by a three year old in a nappy
A	what?
B	I was in Moss Side and Robin
A	I don't remember this story
B	yeah
A	yeah go on
B	he had a flat in erm he was at university
A	yeah
B	he had a flat in Moss Side which is you know quite notorious
A	yeah
B	and we were just sitting around one day on the ground floor in the living room
A	oh my God
B	waddling along and all of the
A	oh okay
B	come on
B	run
A	oh my God
B	yeah
A	so this
B	Moss Side
A	mm
B	I think it's where Shameless is set as well
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	yeah
A	did he just take one ornament?
B	yeah
B	we got it back
A	teaching them young
B	yeah
A	oh my God
B	mm
A	ah
B	mm
A	whatever they get up to
B	mm
A	whatever trouble they get into and stuff
B	mm
A	God
B	yeah well they were
A	I can't imagine
B	yeah they were proper like street kids really
A	yeah
B	it's terrible
A	yeah
B	they looked wild
A	hmm
B	I was quite intimidated by that three year old in a nappy
A	I thought you were gonna say
B	no?
A	no
B	mm
A	I had this image though before you said er this little three year old was like had some sort of weapon
A	some sort of stick or something
B	mm
A	oh you can't believe it can you
B	hmm?
A	boggles my mind
B	well I was
A	I'm sure like lots of them are alright
B	yeah they were all sound
A	oh I know
B	it's just you do get a few complete nutters
A	just if I like if we moved into one of those I think I'd be quite scared
B	yeah
A	of like walking and cos I used to get really intimidated by gangs of people
B	yeah
A	gangs of teenagers and stuff
B	yeah
A	I don't know why
B	mm
A	just the feeling of feeling intimidated by groups of kids hanging out
B	mm
A	you know? Most of them are only hanging out
B	mm
A	they've got nowhere else to go and they sit on the street corner and like
B	mm
A	they might shout a few things or something but
B	but
A	I don't know
B	yeah
A	but I like when we were  when we were  travelling and stuff I used to always say that oh the kids the teenagers or the kids um aren't so intimidating in other places
B	yeah
A	but it's just the same
B	bo it's different though
A	mm
B	it is different
A	sometimes you can feel their eyes burning into you or something
B	yeah but in a different way
A	oh
B	do you mean here or there?
A	no here
B	here yeah
A	Cos
B	yeah
A	is here
B	this is the most dangerous country we've ever been
A	I think it's cos we've had so many
B	well you've been to America so
B	maybe maybe not then
A	yeah I was intimidated there too
B	yeah
A	but
B	but I think countries with an aggressive foreign policy are often
A	mm
B	culture
A	yeah
B	Cos I think it just filters down
A	mm
B	well
A	what just like that?
B	yeah
A	it's my lovely fire that did that
A	we'll have to put it in the other room
B	yeah
A	no
B	you know you get your
A	yeah
B	but that's that's not from the heart
A	yeah yeah stuff that they're not supposed to say
B	yeah that was a bad er
A	yeah
B	mm
A	if they did anything wrong
B	well yeah
A	oi you get back in your house
B	yeah right
A	what are you doing? I'm gonna tell your mother
A	you remember that kid?
B	yeah
A	yeah that was brilliant
B	yeah
A	in Tunisia when
B	yeah
A	he
B	yeah well that was nasty cos he was a neighbour
A	yeah
B	little bastard
A	I don't
B	no he called me a monkey man
A	did he? No and then  and then  he
B	and then something else yeah
A	he said  he said  something quite bad I think cos
B	yeah
A	I went I'm gonna tell
B	you did say it in French yeah
A	wow
B	I'm going to tell your mother
A	where's
B	oh okay
A	I just think I said where's your mum
B	oh Okay
A	I'm no I I will talk to your mum
A	probably you know really really like robotic French
B	well it worked didn't it
A	so he legged it
B	yeah
A	yeah well that's what you need
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	whereas kids here
A	yeah they do yeah
B	I mean look at
A	she is fifteen
B	oh she is fifteen
A	she's sixteen next month
B	yeah exactly
A	well she's been through a lot
B	it's
A	just think like because there's so many more um there's a lot more break ups of families
B	nah
A	aggressions in families
B	no
A	Don't you think?
B	no
A	I think there is
B	no
A	no?
B	no
A	mm
B	but I do think like kids are getting a shorter time to be kid
A	but why?
B	they're getting so much pressure
A	they don't work any more
B	to develop sexually more than anything
A	yeah but like you know I had I started
B	yeah but that's different
A	no cos they can't do that any more
B	no
A	they can't even get jobs any more
B	no
A	well they find it harder I think
B	but they
A	mm
B	I mean look at um um going back
A	yeah
B	but do you remember S-Clubs Juniors or something?
A	S-Club Seven
B	no the the little ones
A	okay
B	they were about I don't know ten
A	oh
B	and they were all tarted up in short skirts and makeup
A	yeah the
B	doing this sexy dancing and all that
A	mm
B	and that kind of stuff filters down and gets exaggerated over time
A	mm
B	you know what I mean? And that's that's what these kids are
[ANNOTATION]	S-Clubs Juniors performed some sexy dancing.	Entailment
A	mm
B	I mean when I grew up my kids my my role models were do you know what I mean cartoon characters or
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B didn't allow his/her kids to watch anime.	Contradiction
A	yeah but
B	football players or
A	you know
B	but now
A	all
B	look at this pop idol and all that stuff you know
A	I'm saying it's been a long long a good many many many years that girls have hitched their skirts up at school
B	yeah
A	that girls have I don't know started experimenting when they're very young
B	yeah
A	I mean I had kids in my high school that got pregnant
B	mm
A	and I think we look at kids as being
B	yeah
A	but actually I don't think it's that different
B	yeah or that
[ANNOTATION]	It happens that a student will get pregnant.	Entailment
A	you get older
B	yeah that's a sign of getting old
A	yeah
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	People are not getting any younger.	Entailment
A	Tom I I remember getting tarted up on a night out you know little mini skirt
B	mm
A	so
B	but you didn't have it shoved down your throat every time the TV was on
A	no
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A wore a short skirt when was young.	Entailment
B	yeah
A	whereas they do now
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	and how you've gotta portray yourself to other people and
A	but why
B	well because they're more conscious about their image
A	and make them more aggressive?
B	and they they have to create this identity for themselves
A	mm
B	and what? What is a popular identity? Then they get that idea from things they see on TV
A	mm
B	popular culture
A	mm
B	and it's been as far as I can see has been targeted towards like younger and younger people
A	yeah
B	just the marketing of it
A	yeah
B	mm
A	of kids
B	mm
A	like that's not like a typical role model thing is it? Like some aggressive kid
B	what about it?
A	and there was a boy on there
B	well he got kicked off that show for taking drugs or something didn't he?
A	he
B	I think so cos
A	and
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	but he was young
A	yeah he looked very young
B	he wasn't like I mean who else has there been? I mean there's been plenty of drug abuse people being kicked out

A	Chris?
B	no
A	no idea
B	oh well
A	I have heard
B	it was quite a while ago
A	yeah
B	hmm
A	yeah but now maybe you're right cos now you'd probably wouldn't bother being kicked off nowadays
A	it would just be like oh yeah
A	would he?
B	yeah he would
A	they're probably all in the back in the changing room all doing it together
A	come on everybody

B	what's that got to do with a green Blue Peter badge?
