C	yeah he's my phone
A	did you know that it used to just be Twitter that had all the ats and hashtags and stuff? but it has it has reached Facebook and people are using hashtags and ats and stuff like that so then you get topics that are called trending topics so people put hashtag for lots of things and it's a public post and and it so say a very famous person dies everyone would put a hashtag about that and then it means that it is trending and that you can see the trends that people are talking about
C	mm
B	can you read it again I didn't

C	but and a dead person
A	so this is a mummified person?
C	a mummified person
A	so is this what's all inside your head then?
C	erm
A	I don't know if I want to know
B	it's not

C	it's not what's in my head
A	Lucy the Angel in Training
C	yeah
A	looks a little bit scary though don't you think?
B	why is she scary?
A	I don't know she looks a bit skeleton-like in her face she looks cute on the main character list why are they thinking of cheese when someone said it's heaven? do they like cheese?
C	no they never said it's heaven she said I'm Lucy Angel in Training
A	why are they thinking about cheese?
C	because Bob's an idiot
A	oh this is erm this is a very postmodern avant-garde type thing
B	can you read it again cos I
A	no he can read it again later
B	also I couldn't keep up so
C	it is a very bad story though
A	yes I don't think you're meant to be able to keep up with it
B	are you?
A	it doesn't really make any a lot of sense does it?
B	no I couldn't
B	I was I was listening but I didn't know where I was looking at the pictures as well but at some point I got stuck on the pictures there
[ANNOTATION]	Bob has an IQ of 55.	Neutral
A	don't take any more Lego out leave them in there and you just need to select the Lego one bit at a time
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B was taking a look at some images.	Entailment
C	I didn't really have I could only fit it on that page because
A	I love it
C	so I couldn't really do much of a story
B	I want
A	but there is a story there
B	because I like it?
A	you like it?
B	yeah
A	there is a story story there
C	I was
A	a beginning a middle and an end
C	I was planning to do a different story but then I found out how much how little I had left so I
A	oh
C	couldn't properly do Mummy Guy
[ANNOTATION]	The story is a very big one.	Neutral
A	well you could always have done two pages
C	true
A	but that's partly why writers plan isn't it so they can
C	storyboarding
B	what's storyboarding?
A	when you literally do write sort of you are drawing squares and in those squares you work out what's gonna happen in terms of the action so if you're doing a cartoon you know that you've got you need twelve squares for the action but
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B doesn't know what storyboarding is.	Entailment
C	mm
A	it's lovely
C	and I did do it out of my mind as well
A	that's my concern to be honest
B	I love you
C	why?
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B hates speaker C.	Contradiction
A	cos it's crazy no I love it I love it
B	and I also love
A	and do you know what? when you are like twenty-nine and you look back and you think wow I did this when I was just nine
C	well if
A	you'll be very impressed
B	yeah maybe when you
C	although twenty-nine I wonder how erm far I'll be in the drawing world or the
A	yeah well and I was gonna say that's the easier thing about doing cartoons when you can do it using computers because then
C	yeah that's why people can go really fast on the computer
A	mm
C	but when they're typing they make loads of mistakes and they go over them
A	yeah I mean if you get if you do a lot of typing you do get used to it and you don't make too many mistakes I'm pretty good at not making too many mistakes but I I do make a few but yes as you say it's the getting it down on the on that page that you can do without worrying about spelling and things so much
C	yeah
A	I love it but you have you got yes so did you look at the
C	yes
A	did you do that?
C	I did
A	ah is there a space in there to draw cartoons too?
C	erm let's have a little check
B	no remember when you did that pirate book that pirate story?
A	which?
B	he did a pirate story
A	you did a pirate story? did you?
C	I think so I might have done it in here

B	he's also handsome
C	yeah
B	yes
A	that well how was that useful in terms of his cartoon career
B	he's got a nice face and it'll sell books
A	well that is actually true a pretty face does help to sell books did you know that my friend
C	no
A	mm
B	oh by the way mum I want to make up how to make a style er a Millennium Falcon bed and then do it

A	ooh
B	cos cost she actually sings
C	yeah Gazelle is a famous popstar
B	try every erm and there's an actual song called Try Everything
A	well
A	what I can reveal to you is sometimes in films they sometimes have one person doing the voice and then another person doing the singing part but they could well have got a singer to do both the the singing and the speaking part
B	I definitely knew it was the same person because
A	okay
A	well well I think it would be interesting
B	these pages are hard to turn
A	yeah don't do that cos that's too noisy but Gazelle is a nice name actually isn't it?
B	yeah Gazelle isn't
A	ah and she's an anthropomorphic character
A	do you know what that means? can you remember?

B	also brown
A	mm mm
B	no there's some brown pens at school which are called maroon
A	no well that's wrong cos maroon is a very dark purple
C	yeah I know
B	oh
C	it's not proper brown
A	cos remember I've said my joke there was a ship carrying red paint and a ship carrying blue paint they crashed into each other and all the sailors were marooned do you get it?
C	yeah
B	they turn purple yeah
B	yeah like they'll go oh ooh I'm sexy
A	why do you keep saying things are sexy?
A	you're only seven

A	I didn't
B	you
C	yeah you were the one who
B	and stool
C	if it wasn't if it wasn't for you we wouldn't know the word existed
A	sit up but what what's the context what was I talking about at the time?
C	you were talking about you when you when you mentioned sexy
B	about how there was erm a film about a little programme about how you about how
C	oh yeah
B	about people having sex
A	what?
C	yeah it's true
A	did I?
B	yeah
C	remember when you were telling us that it doesn't erm tell you how to have sex properly
A	huh no I don't remember this conversation at all
B	yeah
A	was I very tired?
B	no
A	what was the
C	it was about we were talking about babies and then you said that on Youtube you can look at how to have sex but it doesn't show it properly
B	and people just started wanting to have things like they like when they're trying to do it exactly like that
A	I was yes I was talking about how children
B	what's pornography?
A	which is what I've so yes which is people having
B	oh my god
A	er they get paid to have sex and it yes
C	ah
A	and yeah often the women are very badly treated and it hurts and it's not very nice erm and
B	ah
A	and
A	and that's called parenting whereas the way you were saying it sounded like I was just saying yeah there's this programme that shows you how to have sex but it doesn't show you how to have sex properly
A	and that means it's like alarm bells are going off and I'm thinking what on earth were we talking about and when did that conversation occur? and so I understand and I was just drawing your attention to it because
A	shh I want you to know about this so if you do encounter this at some point with your friends then you will be aware of it and hopefully
A	stop it
