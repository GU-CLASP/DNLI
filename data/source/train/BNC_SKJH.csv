C	in shot
B	a lovely robin's nest I want to show you
A	oh right
B	yeah we do yeah
A	cos you had one in the shed for ages didn't you?
B	yeah yeah we did
A	well I suppose once they find somewhere to nest they
B	yeah there was one in there in in there
A	but in the wooden shed you had
C	mm
B	yeah that's right the window they went through the window yeah
C	yeah yeah
A	I keep trying to make my garden bird-friendly
B	yeah
A	but I never seem to have any nests in there
A	you know
C	no?
A	well
C	I would've thought you'd have loads in your garden
A	well I would yeah but er they don't I I I find one or two
C	mm
C	mm
C	yeah they've built a lovely extension
B	they've built an extension on the house
A	oh really?
C	that's lovely isn't it?
B	ain't it great?
A	mm well wasn't that er a nest on top of a nest on top of a nest or something?
B	no that that all
B	that did then I put them up
A	yeah
C	mm
B	got another one somewhere oh it's over there ain't it?
C	yeah we've gotta remove that one in the wrong place
B	yeah that's in the wrong place
A	yeah
A	well I put loads of bird boxes up and
B	you've got bees in them ain't you?
A	yeah I've got bees in one
C	yeah
A	and er there is one which blue tits use
B	yeah?
A	but most of them
A	don't go anywhere near them
B	no
A	but on the other hand it's difficult to if you're not actually sitting there watching it
B	yeah yeah
A	to actually see a bird go in you know
C	mm
B	yeah
A	cos they they pick a time to go in and out even when they're feeding
B	they do yeah yeah
C	mm
A	you know they sort of er
C	mm
B	we find that the birds about one o'clock disappear
A	mm
B	cos er none on none on that bird feeder is there for
C	no
B	for about an hour
C	there's
A	yeah
C	definitely
B	they stop singing
B	yeah yeah
B	they do
A	at ten o'clock
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	all the
B	well you're alright for sparrows then
A	that's it yeah
B	yeah
A	but they all nest in the hedge across the road
C	mm
A	they've got a really good thick hedge across the road and
B	yeah
A	the people who own it like every year they cut it a bit lower you know cos it used to be a massive great
B	oh I see yeah
A	sort of wild hedge and they sort of keep
C	mm
B	yeah
A	one day they're gonna just decide to get rid of it altogether
B	altogether yeah
C	yeah
A	then there'll be er several families of sparrows got nowhere to live
C	yeah
B	we've got sparrows living in the around
C	mm
A	yeah?
B	they all got yeah come and have a look
A	the old wrens'll get make a little
B	yeah
A	but sparrows usually like to be in something
B	yeah
A	or underneath something that's how they got under the
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	hello
A	oh
B	it has yeah
A	yeah
B	they use it
C	mm
B	and I think the wrens get in there now they just they just go up there and roost
C	mm
B	but there's something in it cos you've got
A	but wrens wrens live in nests all the year round don't they?
B	yeah yeah there's
A	yeah
B	about six of them
A	yeah
B	in one nest
C	mm
A	but they have
A	little nests and they'll go from one to the other and live in them all the year round
B	yeah
C	oh right
B	look at the robin coming
C	mm
B	he's telling me off
B	there's one up there
B	that look like it to me
A	yeah I think it's an old one though
B	yeah
C	mm
A	but I've found blackbirds' nests in my driveway
C	right
A	and you never knew they were there
B	no
A	it's only when sort of in the autumn
C	yeah
A	when the leaves fall off
A	and you suddenly
B	that's
C	mm mm
B	we didn't know that was there until all the leaves
A	mm
B	everywhere
B	they're mice yeah
B	there he is look
B	I think that was a gold crest I don't know
B	yeah
C	mm
B	yeah
A	and they might be wrens
B	yeah
A	and the sort of like little bits of
C	mm
A	erm moss and stuff

B	so
C	yeah they do use a lot of horsehair don't they?
B	yeah

B	they're getting through these ones
C	yeah
B	and even the hedge sparrows go in there

A	well exactly
C	no
B	I'll do that for you dear let me carry that for you
A	it's funny
B	they do don't they? yeah
A	it's a bloke who come I told you about the
B	yeah
A	who comes in and they bring tea and coffee and chocolates all
B	yeah
A	twice as much as you pay anywhere else
A	and there's another bloke who comes in and

C	probably look forward to them coming round don't they?
A	well that's right exactly
C	yeah someone to talk to and
C	different
A	don't matter who's there I'm thinking
A	if they wanna speak to me they'll have to come round the back
B	yeah er yeah
C	mm
A	I just refuse to answer the front door
B	yeah well that's right why should you?
C	mm
A	and I think well
A	anyone who knows me
B	come round the back
A	come round the back door
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	and er anyone official I'm not interested
B	yeah we always worry when people knock on the front door
A	mm
C	yeah we worry
B	cos I mean and it it's well known that in Norfolk especially people go round the back door
A	yeah
C	everyone we know
A	yeah
A	mm
C	yeah
A	or even if you knocked on the front door you'd then go round the back wouldn't you?
B	yeah
C	mm
B	oh we've told them to go round the back haven't we?
A	mm
C	we have yeah sometimes
B	go round the back
C	cos we can't find the key to open it
C	if you wanna piece of chocolate help yourself
A	no no
C	well it's
C	mm?
B	no
B	that's dark chocolate
B	yeah
C	there's a bit left isn't there?
A	yeah
B	there's a lot left
C	oh you told me there was only a little bit
B	well I just like to
A	well there's only
B	there's enough left
C	mm
B	well you should know
A	well you you know I'd be too polite to
C	well you would wouldn't you?
A	you know I'm such a polite person
B	well yeah yeah you're like me
C	yeah
A	mm
C	we did mention it earlier on
A	mm
B	that weren't hiding
A	that was hidden under the cushion weren't it? mm
B	that weren't hiding that's just how things happen
A	and there was Ed Miliband there he he sneaked a sweet out of his pocket did you see that?
B	oh yes he did didn't he? yes
A	he was sort of sitting there
C	yeah
A	and he went
B	yeah
A	like this and then
C	yeah
B	yeah and then
A	yeah and then
B	then pop it in his mouth didn't he?
C	yeah
B	but the camera was there
C	yeah
A	mm
C	it was wasn't it?
B	on him all the time
B	yeah
C	uhu
A	mm god it'll be interesting to know what's gonna happen in this election
C	mm yeah it will be
A	I just hope it
B	yeah
A	I hope that Labour and the Scottish Nationalists'll get in
B	yeah
A	cos the Scottish Nationalists
A	and the latest thing that I read that what they're doing in Scotland
B	yeah
A	and what they're gonna do is they're gonna work out a scheme to get rid of all the unnecessary paperwork involved with teaching
B	brilliant
A	and you think that er why don't they do that in this country?
B	why don't they do it? yeah
A	you know
B	because they employ too many
B	that's right yeah
C	mm
A	and then they'll bring in something else they'll have to do three times
A	then they'll bring
B	well
C	mm
B	he he's a teacher at er
A	mm
B	he gets his work er he teaches and then he has to
A	mm
C	mm
B	and then in holiday times he still have to go in
A	mm yeah yeah
C	and there are students every evening want extra
B	and
A	mm yeah
B	want extra tuition
A	that's right yeah
B	and they don't get paid extra for it
A	no that's right yeah
B	no he don't get home till seven I mean er schools knock off at four
C	mm
B	but he's home
A	mm
B	he get home at seven
A	well
B	yeah
A	and you know to get on they have to have a minimum level of maths
B	yeah
A	and
B	yeah
A	and so she has to go in for three hours and then she won't go in
C	mm
A	and then she'll have them again for another three hours
B	I should think they've forgotten what they learnt
A	and then there's another sort of like six weeks and then they'll get another three hours
B	yeah
A	she hasn't been she hasn't been able to teach them anything there's just no time cos they had to do all this paperwork which has to be filled in first
C	mm
B	oh how ridiculous is that eh?
A	and then once they've done all the paperwork and that they have to do these sort of trial test to see
B	to see
A	to see what they know
C	mm
A	before you can start teaching them anything you gotta find out what they know
C	mm
A	and she's had them like three times now and she said she hasn't taught them anything
C	mm
B	how do they get away from school when they don't know anything?
A	well they these are apprentices who left at sixteen or something
B	yeah
A	or whatever and then get roped in well anyone can leave school without knowing anything don't they?
B	well I suppose they could I mean
A	how much French did you know when you left school?
B	well we didn't have any French at all
B	but we did have English and maths
A	mm
B	science and geography history
A	what period of history did you do?
B	we done everything we done all the kings and queens
A	but didn't you have to do a specific period?
B	yeah we well we did we did er medieval and we did er pre-medieval that's it
A	pre-medieval
B	yeah when which was
A	dark ages
B	which was right the way back weren't it? and the thing I
A	so what come first? the Romans or the Vikings?
B	the Vikings were
B	were the first ones weren't they?
A	no
B	weren't they? oh I dunno
B	I didn't do pre-medieval
A	no no no no no no
B	no the first the
C	Egyptians?
B	the Romans come in
A	the Romans
B	hundred AD or something weren't they?
A	er yeah well they
B	they were before Christ weren't they?
A	that would be BC
B	that'd be BC yeah
A	I think they were about fifty BC they
B	yeah yeah that's it yeah
A	and they were here for three hundred years or
B	well they ain't gone away yet have they?
A	then they left and then there was a bit of a gap and then
B	the Vikings come and plundered
A	the Vikings and the Anglo-Saxons
B	yeah
A	can't remember the Anglo-Saxons is that's the thing you see the Anglo-Saxons is the biggest
B	that's right yeah
A	cos we're all Anglo-Saxons
B	we are yeah
A	cos they did a test recently didn't they? they found
B	yeah
A	you know they got no no or very little erm connection with er Nordic genes but
B	yeah that's right
A	lots and lots of connection with German genes
B	yeah
A	which is where the Anglo-Saxons came from
B	yeah
A	cos all these people said oh you know Vikings
B	the Vikings actually only well they invaded but they didn't they didn't er stay here like they did in erm in er er Hebrides and and around that area and Greenland and
A	Faroe Islands Iceland
B	Faroe
A	mm
B	that's where they they er
A	yeah well they they there's there were settlements here like in York weren't there? obviously
B	yeah there yeah
A	they had settlements there for probably hundred and fifty years or something
B	yeah
A	and in Northern Ireland as well
B	yeah Northern Ireland
A	and all along the coast of Ireland
B	yeah yeah
A	cos they sort of went right round and then round
B	they did yeah yeah
A	but the Vikings got everywhere they got to
B	did they? oh I didn't know that
A	yeah and that was one of their major towns and they traded with the er Ottoman Empire
B	oh the Ottomans I remember yeah
A	going all the way down
B	yeah
A	all through what is now Ukraine and
B	they were a brilliant lot though really when you think about it
B	I mean they were the first
B	first to er discover or invent the compass
A	well maybe
B	well this is this is the
A	yeah
B	the thing
A	but they had Venetian traders before them who er
B	they did didn't they?
A	went all over the place didn't they? and that was like
B	yeah
A	a thousand years
B	well Tony Curtis he he did the compass bit
B	on the Vikings
A	ah yeah
B	cos he got
A	yeah
B	he got to Britain in the fog
A	a lodestone they had
B	yes they did yeah
A	which is a bit of iron meteorite which is naturally
B	that's right yeah
B	that's right yeah
A	mm
B	oh that was called the Vikings that was that film did you ever see that
A	yes yes utter rubbish
B	a load of rubbish weren't it?
B	a load of rubbish
A	yeah
B	have you seen Tony Curtis lately?
A	a big fat old git ain't he?
B	oh he's horrible
A	yeah
B	how'd he get like that?
A	but then Elizabeth Taylor was no picture when she was in her dotage was she?
B	well that's true no
A	how'd you get like that? good life good eating
A	lots of alcohol
B	lots of alcohol and drugs
A	yeah but a lot of people are good looking when they're young
B	well look at me I'm still good looking
A	yeah
A	whoops
A	these things are not made for feet are they?
B	I don't think so no
