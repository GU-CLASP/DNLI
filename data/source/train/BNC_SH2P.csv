B	yeah I don't really like it fair enough if you're gonna eat it that's fine but I got a bit of a problem with erm
C	well
B	mounting it up on your wall and that kind of shit
C	or mount it I shoot at work because
B	well you're culling them aren't you?

B	it was dark was it? what were they all doing out?
C	I don't know mate I was thinking what's this
C	I was thinking why have you got twenty-four seven? maybe they're on some sort of challenge or something
B	doing their cycling proficiency test
C	yeah I thought mate they were like street angels on bikes
B	sorting out
C	I've got a flat tyre don't worry the street angels are going

B	no?
C	no
B	yeah cool
C	yeah it was not that long
B	maybe at the speed you were going
C	yeah
C	yeah
B	how I'm gonna fare
C	I was thinking a bike's is a pretty simple design innit?
B	yeah
C	I wonder when it was invented though
B	er when it was invented?
C	yeah sure they could've made a bike in Ancient Rome?
B	I think the problem was rubber wasn't it? like something that they needed to roll the wheels on cos
C	they could've done it they could've done it with leather
B	they tried to make it out of like wood or something it was like yeah you'd think of leather wouldn't you? that would work
C	yeah my grandad used to run a bike made out of leather cos he was too poor to
B	yeah
B	I'm imagining the whole bike's made out of leather so
B	some weird little floppy bike you know
C	you saw a what?
B	it was a tiny little car and it had no doors it just
C	a car?
B	yeah yeah I'm just saying if ever I've seen a car
C	well
B	I thought that was my car and I would
C	oh right right right
B	it was like a little car with erm no doors it didn't use to have any doors it was like a little what do you call them? is it a hatchback when you can't there's no doors to the back?
C	yeah yeah
B	you just sit in the back so there was only the two front doors they'd been removed and there was just like a piece of rope that was attached like properly well done like and it hooked on to the other side
C	yeah
B	so you just undo the rope and get in your car and do the rope back up
C	where is this in a fucking theme park?
B	I've just it in Greece somewhere just on an island I guess it was just so safe and chilled on the island
C	yeah
B	they just had rope instead of doors and it's probably hot all fucking year round so I mean
C	yeah I know when I first went to Cyprus
B	yeah
C	it was
B	mm
C	but they fucking get well hot in the summer we had to put towels on them they're
B	yeah
C	like
B	did I tell you my friend's got a boat? she's
C	I think so
B	she's got with some guy recently who absolutely loves Depeche Mode but that's just random
C	how old is she?
B	they pretty much spend at the minute she's been out there for a few months and she's
C	how old is she?
B	how old is she?
C	yeah
B	maybe thirty thirty-one
C	oh right like a sugar daddy
B	yeah I mean her last few boyfriends have been kind of old as well
C	yeah
B	not like old old but like forties maybe always like ten ten years older than her maybe erm anyway
C	mm
B	and spend months doing it and I'm hopefully next April or May I've got friends that are teaching in Ankara in Turkey so
C	see I I keep saying to
B	I might teach there
B	if I taught there would you come there?
C	yeah well she's just worried about going there like on holiday mate
B	obviously if I taught there I'd be able to put you up I might have a place for you to crash
C	there's loads of history in Turkey yeah
B	yeah there is
C	Istanbul yeah what's the
B	that's how they said it when I was there so
C	mm they say that in Portugal everything's
B	yeah
C	so you know
B	Portuguese man sounds like Spanish and Russian had a baby
B	it really does I don't
C	ah man I'm trying to think of some of the words I said er
C	and what's thank you?
C	yeah oh no
B	or
C	they used to say oh er oh mate what is it? just anything
C	like
B	Portugese yeah
C	so weird mate
B	or instead of
C	no that's it you can say please in Portuguese and it's
C	I was like
B	I think I think like
B	but I guess it's kinda like the
C	from which?
B	but
C	er I'm trying to think
C	no no that was like please but
B	you've got the same as me mate a high beard
C	yeah yeah yeah
B	do you have to trim this shit?
C	I do sometimes yeah
B	yeah
C	but not always
B	yeah
B	mine goes really high like up here
C	yeah
B	you can see it on the
C	oh mate what is thank you?
B	I mean do you want me to look it up?
C	yeah please look it up it's gonna annoy cos it's not just thank you it's something which you can say like
B	actually I have a laptop now that it's fast enough
B	so I'm like
C	oh mate
B	oh I've just turned it off and you know
C	it's gonna proper annoy me if you find it
B	I'll find it
C	say thank you in Portuguese
C	no no look
B	you like those boobies don't you?
C	yeah it's quite a good
C	cos it's not much colour going on so
B	I looked for one of those yeah
C	yeah it's just like a grey scale apart from on the feet
B	yeah
C	it's a bit surreal
B	well what was I looking for?
C	ah
B	ah
C	they're just like they're gonna say
B	do you know like letters like R and L oh it doesn't work so much for R and L but like S and Z is exactly the same letter? and B and P and G and K are exactly the same letters
C	mm
B	yeah
C	like what the fuck do they
B	but if you put your hand on your throat here
C	yeah
B	and you go ssss
C	yeah
B	and then you go zzzz tell me the difference
C	ssss zzzz there's a humming when I do zzzz
B	yeah it vibrates yeah
C	yeah
B	but that's the only difference in in linguistics it's called voicing and unvoicing so S and
C	mm
B	but one is vibrating the vocal cords and one isn't you have a lot of those
C	mm
B	K is
C	isn't this the difference what of
C	between a vowel and a consonant is?
B	no they're all consonants
C	all they all come from your throat or one comes all from the throat and the other one is produced outside the mouth
B	every sound I just gave you was a consonant vowels are like A E O you know?
C	yeah and they yeah so they'll be pronounced differently
B	yeah
B	well they're
B	well they're all voiced and so consonants can be voiced or unvoiced
C	and
B	but vowels are all voiced
C	yeah
B	you can't make a vowel without vibrating the vocal cords
C	yeah yeah yeah yeah
B	erm
C	everything used to be consonants like the
B	I think you might be talking about the alphabet but not actually pronunciation
C	oh no no no well then in the alphabet no cos
B	because we always require vowels
C	well in the Greek alphabet
B	there's no language which has no vowels
C	well maybe they already had the vowels
B	but like in Hebrew and in
C	but in
B	in Classical Arabic it's written with no vowels like writing is just consonants and then
C	yeah well yeah well Phoenician
B	you can
C	Ancient Greek language originates from the Phoenicians
B	okay
B	that's
C	yeah yeah so the Phoenicians had yeah
B	that's the original
C	and they had mate they had like a hundred odd letters
B	mm
C	and it was all for keeping stocks and all shit like that but then over time
B	yeah
C	before the Ancient Greek one
B	mm mm
C	but there was no
B	well apparently
C	and I think that's why like
C	they started writing loads and doing music and there's like all the music and drama and all that shit
C	of how
B	every single alphabet in the world comes from the Phoenician alphabet every single one in the whole world there's not an alphabet that doesn't come from the Phoenician alphabet
C	erm
B	cos there're other languages if you go to the east
B	they have logographic languages which aren't
C	yeah but what are they called? they they call
B	it's not an alphabet
C	what's what's an insulting name for a Jewish person? someone from Israel?
B	I
C	semitic yeah cos don't you get semitic language?
B	yes that's
C	and I think that where it's split it's split into what we have now what we have now into the Ancient Greek and stuff and the other one went
B	okay
C	and then like later into I don't know fucking
B	yeah
C	is that what semitic is?
B	erm yeah I mean we were talking about alphabets though weren't we?
C	yeah cos you were saying Phoenician language was the first language and everything came from it
B	all
C	well that's
B	in the whole world
C	look up
B	but do you know like what do they have in China?
B	do they have an alphabet?
C	erm I don't really know what it is cos it's
B	it's called logographic it's when
C	just look up
B	I will do in a sec but let me just explain
C	so so we don't forget
B	it's like
C	mm mm
B	to represent phonemes which are the sounds
C	mm mm
B	effectively so we have one letter and that represents a sound we have
C	mm
B	it can be a combination of letters but you make letters to represent
C	mm
B	it's logographic they have a
C	mm
B	they have an image that represents a word and sometimes they can have extra lines that indicate pronunciation
C	mm
B	but in general it's er and that's logographic you then also got hieroglyphic which is more pictorial it's got like images that connect so
C	mm
C	yeah yeah cos erm
B	so what I'm saying is that
C	isn't cuneiform a major part of this?
B	cuneiform was one of the oldest languages in the
C	isn't that like one of the bridges for erm?
B	cuneiform is a type of writing
C	yeah but it's after the Egyptians isn't it?
B	but it's a type of writing it's like the clay slate or something that they wrote on and that
C	but I thought their
B	I think if you Google cuneiform I think it's a type of writing
C	yeah yeah yeah it's just cuneiform came up here somewhere cuneiform
B	yeah yeah
C	no
B	diacritic is any kind of
C	mm
B	if it's aspirated or er er let me take a word for example say P A T what's that word?
B	P A T
C	oh oh pat sorry I thought
B	pat now say splat
C	splat
B	if you notice in the English language the first P that you say is aspirated a puff of air comes out the second one it doesn't hold your hand in front of your
C	pat
B	pat
C	pat
B	can you feel a P? like a puff of air?
C	yeah pat yeah
B	now say splat
C	sometimes you spit
B	say splat
B	there's no puff of air afterwards splat
C	splat splat splat
B	so that would be marked by
C	yeah it could be maybe
B	by it's minimum
C	you went splat
B	it's minimal
C	yeah
B	you'd have to enunciate you have to go splat
C	yeah yeah yeah it's not P you're not like proper pushing the air out
B	that's called aspiration it can either be aspirated or not aspirated so a diacritic would put a little H above it
C	mm
B	and the H indicates that it's got an air puff it's like er
C	yeah
B	I'll show you in a second
C	yeah man
B	do you want me to show you?
C	yeah go for it
B	you might recognise a bunch of these words
C	I tell you what's weird yeah
B	oh
C	you know what I mean? or you're the top you're the best of the best
B	yeah
C	I but I said to my grandad how do you spell
C	yeah there's a few in the Greek ones
B	eh
C	I learnt them all but there's no there's
B	it's not a diphthong
C	when you read when I read
B	but a
C	but they use that as a word but when I asked my grandad
B	but er a diphthong is only a
C	he struggled to spell it
B	I understand that a diphthong is only a vowel
C	mm
B	that would be a monophthong a diphthong would be a double vowel sound like ow ear and then
C	a diphthong is in
B	a a triphthong would be a triple one like
C	mm
B	eh ah
C	yeah
B	ah eh are
C	a diphthong's in erm
B	but what you're talking about is called erm
C	yeah but they didn't have there's no other word like it er I couldn't find one
B	right it doesn't have
C	yeah it's not in the Greek alphabet
B	but we've got
C	so you've got the alpha
B	we've got plenty of sounds in English
C	yeah but you've got C H and when you see it together you know it's like
B	yeah but that's two separate
C	I know but there's yeah but if you if you said
B	but we can draw it that's what you're saying
C	yeah as in church
B	so you can't write in
C	there's no
B	Greek
C	the Greek like
B	they don't have bunch of sounds in all fairness
C	they got alpha yeah it's weird right look under Greek language
B	I was gonna show you this I've seen I know the Greek alphabet
C	yeah just let me show quick
B	ah
C	ah you'll show me this in a minute it's not going anywhere
B	I just need to see who I got this email from could be important
C	well you might be able to explain this to me
C	Greek alphabet
B	Greek alphabet
C	right so there's no
B	yeah
C	alright just click on this one
B	alpha beta gamma delta epsilon
C	okay so there's no
C	where are you?
C	mm
C	it's actually
C	yeah
C	and that's meant to be
B	ah okay that's cool
C	it's it's sort of K K
B	yeah that's a glottal
C	it's an
B	kind of thing
C	yeah
B	it's like a H
C	yeah you know like how
C	yeah it's so that's
B	it's a guttural something or other it's a
C	yeah it's right at the back innit? like when my grandad's trying to get me to pronounce words he's probably like that
B	yeah
C	I'm like
B	no no well that's because that sound
B	we don't have it in the English language
C	yeah that's meant to be like he
B	yep
C	okay? so any E sound is like you pronounce it as in you know for tea like the E for tea is no that's just the one way to pronounce okay? so eater
B	you can change the vowel
C	yeah but why why have that er?
B	why do you change the vowel though? is it for inflection does it change the grammar?
C	I don't know my my
B	or changes
C	grandad was saying like
B	it's just
C	yeah
B	have you even seen IPH?
C	oh what's that all about? why don't they have one
B	no have you ever seen?
C	but why? tell me why that's what I'm asking
B	I don't know
C	are you not curious? why that? why?
B	yeah I mean I have been I might be able to find it better in one of these books actually you might like these books
C	they're big fucking books mate
B	these are encyclopaedias
C	mm
B	right I'm just looking for the IPA chart it's in pretty much every textbook I've ever bought it's just I don't that I don't have my other textbooks
C	I see what you're trying to do here so
C	so instead of saying heel we'd say eel I don't think so like land he's gone land land land
B	what?
C	like here so you've got land land long land
B	yeah
C	as if it's like Essex like land
B	no that's a symbol
C	yeah that
B	that sound is an A sound
C	so why has he done that?
B	the same as in land
C	why why not just done A?
B	that's what I'm trying to show you there's a phonetic alphabet
C	no but I mean you pronounce that one with the A?
B	well it depends whether they're talking I haven't looked at the book are they talking about an old form of English?
C	no it's
B	is this spelling of the old form of English or is this the pronunciation?
C	pronunciation
B	are you sure?
C	erm
B	it may very well not be
C	oh it says dialects
B	so it's erm spelling
C	yeah
B	so these may be the sounds I know that X is that lock sound that you're talking about
C	yeah it's that
B	so that's written as X
C	he he
B	when when you're reading IPA when you get a dictionary and you look at the thing these are all the different vowels that exist in the whole world
C	mm
B	how many vowels do we have in English?
C	I dunno five I think innit?
B	everyone thinks five but we actually have twelve
C	is it five?
B	in the English language and may even be eighteen
C	is it five then?
B	no we have
B	we have five written vowels A E I O U
B	but vowels sounds
C	that's what I mean that was a guess
B	vowel sounds is like twelve or eighteen and you can see how many different vowel sounds there are so when you saw that one here
C	mm
B	that you said was like S X something or other
C	mm yeah yeah
B	that's an ah sound this one that looks like an A is an R sound like bath
C	ah right
B	so it's ah a eh
C	yeah the
C	man men men
B	yeah then you got diphthongs here
B	that one there is or
B	so that you know the
C	yeah
B	they're
C	mm
B	that uh sound is represented by that symbol if you know what I mean? erm you know when you say which or which?
C	mm
B	which you know some people like which house is it?
C	yeah
B	that
C	ah mate complicated now
B	it is complicated but that's what I was talking about so this is diacritics that is do you not think that's amazing though? that somebody's invented one alphabet for all sounds in every single language
C	yeah well
B	you could write any language in this alphabet
C	is there more letters than in English?
B	than in English?
C	yeah
B	we definitely use a few we use a hell of a lot more than Korean they they use probably about half of the amount of sounds than we do
C	yeah
B	erm which means they really struggle to put English words into that er they never say fish they always say pishy
B	no fish pishy
B	what?
C	mm
B	in
C	mm
B	er pam and blam or whatever you know what I mean? but in Korean they're not they can use them interchangeably so instead of saying run they say lun or lice instead of rice because L and R
C	yeah
B	is not distinguished in their language
C	no I know
B	and B and P isn't distinguished so instead of boo sound it can poo sound it's like it's the same thing
C	it's probably why they
B	it's
C	why can't they say it though? just copy the sound?
B	I don't know we play screen golf and I erm
C	yeah yeah
B	and he came out
C	yeah
B	it's terrible
C	yeah
B	my
C	in Arabic they go
B	yeah
C	why is that?
B	it's just the er sound in their language
C	yeah but
B	there's no reason behind it
C	yeah but
B	they just use it to distinguish a word
C	and that their language what spread over a lot of countries so
B	mm
C	so you'd think it will change
B	it does change there's loads of different types of Arabic
C	is there though?
B	there are there's like every single
C	but I read in a
B	it's a little bit different to to Arabic
C	er yeah I suppose so I suppose it's regional isn't it?
B	yeah it's like dialects
C	but there is like a mother
B	but that's the thing
C	a mother language I think
B	I think
C	cos I'm sure people speak different English
B	there's just different dialects
C	in different places
B	would you agree with that? what I've just said?
C	you know what I mean?
B	there are
C	mm yeah I'd say there are languages because I'd say
B	there're some quite interesting maps in here that show like
C	different
B	but a dialect the whole
C	and different sounds
B	what is the definition of a language?
C	and and no need to
B	how do you define if we're speaking the same language? can you give me a definition?
C	cos I can say a word and you would understand it
B	exactly that's perfect yeah it's called mutual intelligibility if you say something that I can understand then we're speaking the same language that is the only definition of language
C	yeah
B	but there can be quite some pretty difficult dialects of a language where you don't really understand what's being said you know what I mean? you you understand most of it but like a lot of colloquialisms or thick Irish accents or thick Scottish accents
C	oh yeah mate the Scottish accent
B	they can be pretty difficult
B	yeah but they're speaking the same language apparently but it's a different dialect now there's a map in here which shows a map of Europe and it's amazing I didn't realise that it quite went to this extent but you know you hear like
C	mm
C	the
B	it's the closest to the English language so if you what you can do on a map
B	it's pretty interesting
C	yeah
B	you can trace a line across Europe
C	yeah yeah yeah
B	and from this point to this point there'll never be a gap where this culture doesn't understand this there's mutual intelligibility moving along the line where the
C	so I can understand a Frenchman so I you're saying if I don't speak another language but I met a Frenchman
B	no you'll follow a line where it's one way reciprocal like we can understand a bit of Frisian if we listen to it it's a bit weird
C	oh right so you're saying
B	but like but we can't understand French so it follows a line
C	a Frenchman might understand me
B	but a Frenchman might understand a bit of Belgian Dutch or something like that
C	yeah well no apparently there's a place in Belgium cos you know you've got Frisia and all that and then there's Alsatia and they're all part of like France Belgium or whatever
B	mm
C	but they're actually like regional places
B	yeah
C	quite important places
B	yeah that's what I'm talking about
C	they speak a different language in northern
B	so effectively there aren't really any different languages
C	ah I think it depends how you grow up do you know what I mean?
B	but effectively it's just dialects there's a famous quote
C	oh yeah but if you grow up in a place where all these dialects were going on it would just seem like one language
B	yeah
C	but you just got a lot of fucking different ways of pronouncing the same word
B	yeah
C	do you know what I think?
B	what?
C	that we do not know who we are or where we're going in
A	have you decided about that amp?
B	what about it? the big one?
A	yeah
B	no no it's yours mate
A	yeah?
B	yeah are you selling it?
A	yeah
B	yeah okay
C	what amp is it?
B	when? do you want to get it down now?
C	it's not the
A	I'm doing Ebay and they've got
C	it's not the Marshall is it?
A	yeah it is
C	ah you're selling that? that's such a good quality amp
B	I know it is a nice amp
C	why are you selling the
B	cos it's his
C	oh right
B	I gave it to him
B	mate it's Hindi and Urdu it's identical the language is the same it's just different countries erm
C	yeah
B	now when you're move in with someone they're probably gonna be like oh my god the neighbours and
C	yeah mind
C	a
B	yeah
C	I think yeah it's had it mate
A	not today
B	oh you changed it
A	yeah
B	oh shit
