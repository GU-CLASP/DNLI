A	turns out they only go up to a double D
B	tut
A	yep
B	what's with that shit?
A	I've no idea

B	so if you're gonna go for pretty that's what's gonna happen
A	yeah
B	it's gonna have detail in it
A	huh
B	so these are
A	so
B	but those are your choices I think
A	it's either this as it is now
B	mm
A	or if I find another one
B	or or you don't have the straps
A	tut
B	you know
A	tried this
B	mm
A	but then because they go on your hips and kind of stick forward a bit don't they
B	mm
A	then you can see a line around the bottom of the dress
B	tut
A	Cos they're not none of them are you know like my
B	mm
B	yeah
A	the they've all got bones in
B	right
A	which you can see
B	what about the zip up one? Is that not an option?
A	no
B	mm
A	like doesn't hold

B	er yeah
A	huh
B	the flopper
A	tut

B	yeah
A	yeah go ahead open it
B	you let your dad open your bank statements?

A	well no no no
B	right
A	um
B	yeah
A	is that what happened was I went over my overdraft ages ago by a very small amount
B	mm
A	um but it's over by say this is ten pounds
B	yeah
A	um for the month
B	no
A	charged me sixty quid
B	for ten pounds?
A	maybe it's like five pound a day
B	shit
A	that wasn't my overdraft that I signed up for
B	well then you can
A	yeah
B	sue them
A	no
B	thanks love
A	um
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	didn't question it
B	yeah
A	um
B	what?
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A disputed it	Contradiction
B	A bank charge?
A	yeah and I was just like oh do you know what? Just fuck this
B	shit
A	so I thought do you know what? I'll just pay it in
B	I've never heard that
A	I can't afford
B	how is that possible?
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A doesn't have enough money to afford it	Entailment
A	after you can see on my bank account I've put a hundred in then I put two hundred in
B	but charging for what though? Cos you
A	for over your overdraft
B	but you're in your
A	limit
B	but you're in your overdraft
A	no
B	that's sending you over again
A	and then taking me over
[ANNOTATION]	They are talking about financials	Entailment
B	Jesus
A	yeah
B	Jesus
A	it needs to leave
B	I dunno if you've seen it
A	no
B	um
A	huh
B	is that what you were going for?
A	I'll put my jamas on and remove it
B	um
[ANNOTATION]	She wants to ear her pyjamas because she's sleepy	Neutral
A	yes
B	yeah
A	so right the way to here
B	yeah
A	which is where I was
B	mhm
A	car hire
B	yeah
A	basically the interest went on at eight pounds
[ANNOTATION]	The interest went up because of the stock market	Neutral
B	mm
A	how I went over my
B	tut
A	with an eight pound
B	but they should've
[ANNOTATION]	They should have called their customer	Neutral
A	thing
B	they should've flagged that really
A	yeah
B	over your overdraft
A	and then because I was over my overdraft it must be
B	shit
A	to which I was like holy fuck
B	yeah
A	and he said actually you've got another one due
B	shit
A	for a
B	right
A	um
B	then they took a hundred and fifty pounds
A	no no no
B	oh right
A	um
B	shit
A	I put this in
B	yeah
A	thinking right I'm back up to scratch now
B	yeah
A	I can spend some money
B	fuck me
A	yeah
B	so this isn't where your salary goes?
A	no
B	Jesus
A	thank fuck
B	or
A	old current account
B	that you just need to clear
A	yeah
B	shit the bed
A	I mean I've I
B	that is disgusting
A	transfer money in and out of it all the time
B	just to keep you within
A	all these paid outs  all these paids outs account account account  account are all going to my other Natwest account
B	mm
A	that's the thing
B	mm
A	exactly how much I spend
B	mm
A	every month
B	mm
A	and they think that's okay?
B	what what is
A	A hundred and eighty quid
B	where what is that based on? Like what kind of agreement is that?
A	I don't know
B	Cos with HSBC if i go over my overdraft it's thirty-five pounds
A	yeah
B	which I think is extortionate
A	it used to be twenty-eight pounds
B	yeah
A	for one charge
B	are you gonna you're just gonna have to speak to them and say what the hell do you think you're doing? I mean really it doesn't seem like this account is doing you any favours
A	no
B	if you've already got another account that your salary's going in and out of
A	well yeah course I do
A	but when you're earning what I'm earning there's no way I'm paying off five hundred pound is there
B	yeah right
A	there's no way I'm paying off the extra four hundred full stop
B	well absolutely
A	yeah
A	well if you look at the account
A	not now but if you look at this
B	yeah
A	account before I started
B	that's what you're doing
A	the last job my salary used to get paid in here
B	oh I see
A	Cos the other one is interest free overdraft
B	right
A	I stopped it getting paid in here is because they fucked me over doing the exact same thing about six months ago
B	right
A	so when I moved the new job I stopped it cos they'd fucked me over
B	mm
A	and the bank fraud and
B	mm
A	all that shit
B	mm
A	so I stopped money going in here
B	tut
A	so I've never had to worry about this
B	God I'd forgotten about all that
A	yeah
B	when you couldn't access any money for like two months
A	I didn't have a bank card before that
B	yeah
A	for eight months
B	Jesus
A	well I can't move can I cos I  I owe I  owe them two grand
B	yeah but you'll just move the debt
A	can't move two grand
B	I don't know
A	there's nobody gonna give me an overdraft now
B	I mean you've not really got any credit rating
A	what? What did you just say?
B	you haven't got any credit rating have you
A	oh yes
B	yep
A	horrendous
B	you have no good credit
A	yes
B	um
A	my dad got  my dad got  a debt collector letter apparently
B	yeah
A	waiting for him to forward that
B	I've got one of those
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about collector letter	Entailment
B	um
A	that's what I reckon
B	yeah
A	mine's an HSBC credit card
B	brilliant
A	mm
B	I suppose er what you need to do is go into the branch and just say what the fuck do you think you're
A	yeah
B	and just say do you think that
A	well I've spoken to this guy before
B	mm
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about bank	Entailment
A	it's been the past three years with one bank manager
B	mm
A	and his name's
B	clearly
A	and he's the escalator to his boss to the regional boss and to
B	yeah
A	their head office in
B	Jesus
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about weather	Contradiction
A	for this account
B	so they're very aware of this and yet they think that this is acceptable
A	yeah
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about bank account	Entailment
A	I can't every three months be dealing with some type of shite
B	yeah
A	and the best one the kicker is I can't even get to see this guy cos he doesn't work weekends
B	awesome
A	yeah
B	the shifts that you work then yeah?
A	yeah
B	Good
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about book	Contradiction
A	mm
B	that's really helpful
A	so
B	because that can't be legal
B	anything that says what your interest arrangement is
A	God no
B	is there er have you got internet banking?
[ANNOTATION]	person B is not sure they have internet bank or not	Neutral
A	check it out Liz I've had this since I was sixteen
B	is there um yeah er I'm you know I'm mental
A	yeah
B	but er have you got internet banking?
A	mm
B	yeah? Maybe there's maybe I've never looked but maybe in there because I've gone paperless so I never get er paper
A	yeah
B	bank statements
A	account
A	maybe
B	access what your interest arrangement is on there
A	yeah
B	and I would try and find that out before you go in tomorrow
A	oh no I'm not going in
B	okay
A	Cos there's no way I'm dealing with somebody now for them to say you've not done it
B	whatever it is that you do I would make sure that you know what your arrangement is
A	mm
B	say it to their face
A	well they should have it as well shouldn't they when I signed it
B	oh they'll have it on record
A	initially
B	but it just seems that when you're writing the letter you can say this is illegal
A	yeah
B	and I will be taking it up to my ombudsman
A	mm
B	I'm escalating this to this person because
A	A hundred and eighty pound for
B	I can't
A	yeah
B	that's it
A	mine was
B	if you're in by two pounds
A	the worst one I've ever heard is Halifax will charge you a pound a day
B	yeah the but the thing is the bank will charge you an instant fee for for breaking terms of your
A	the terms
B	in of your overdraft
A	because the amount I'm over my overdraft limit is increasing
B	yeah so that's not but that's not the interest
A	no but the percentage
B	yeah but that can er that can never be the percentage
A	I think they're working this out
B	though can it
A	yeah
B	unless er unless it's er
A	five hundred
B	yeah
A	I'm over my overdraft limit by a hundred and thirty-eight pounds
B	the interest
A	a percentage of how much you're over
B	well that would be the explanation
A	isn't it
B	that's like fifty percent
A	yeah
B	that's not three percent or six percent
A	no
B	or whatever is the standard
A	that's like nutty on the TV loan
B	yeah
A	payday thing
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	and my interest on there
B	you need to work that out
A	on the account usually is like really low
B	we need to work it out
A	and the kicker is that if they  if they  look back on my accounts
B	yeah
A	is if they took out every single error that's been theirs I've always been really good with it
B	it's weird
A	always paid it back over the month
B	yeah yeah
A	and any time it's ever gone over or there's been a problem it's been their error
B	mm
A	I mean this isn't their error
B	I think it is their error
A	mm
B	the guy saying you've got another charge due
A	I have no idea
B	I mean what you need to go and do is go back and trace you know the last sort of six months
A	mm
B	and tot it up
B	as much as possible to find what your um what your terms are
A	I'm gonna take this dress off
B	that's gonna be a shit game
A	isn't it
B	print it all off at work
A	that's a
B	and er
A	try that
B	oh okay
A	so
B	on my one you can go back a certain amount and then you have to ask them
A	that's what I've gotta do
B	oh huh
A	cack
B	that's really cack
A	completely forgot where it was despite the fact I live just off it
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	and made
A	via our house
A	I forgot that
B	yeah
A	we drove from

B	like when you drove to Sussex when you were looking for the

A	since I came home

A	actually if you want dental work the cheapest place to do it is Turkey
B	oh okay
A	the cost is in England two grand for an implant
B	sweet
A	yeah
B	so even with the flight you're laughing
A	yeah
B	mm
A	for you going
B	mm
A	and having it done there and then

A	mm
B	of money towards it
A	yeah
B	veneers
A	I was gonna get veneers for my twenty-first
B	mm
A	and then we found out that they don't last
B	no
A	they only last like ten years max don't they
B	I dunno if it's veneers
A	yeah
B	so veneers is probably the wrong word
A	yeah
B	implants I suppose
A	that that's a cap
B	this this is like new teeth
A	if you file it down
B	mm
A	to a point
B	mm
A	and then they put porcelain tooth on
B	mm
A	that's a cap
B	what's a veneer then?
A	A veneer is when they they file it they file most most of your teeth are still there and they put a cover on it I think
B	oh right
A	A cap is the bottom half of your tooth
B	yeah
A	Cos the point's still there
B	mm
A	but it's drilled into your jaw
B	yeah
A	implants
B	they drilled into his jaw
A	so they would've he would've had to have all his teeth removed
B	uh
A	not filed down
B	mm
A	maybe
B	that they drilled it down to pegs
A	oh they
B	but there there was drilling into his  into his  skull
A	yeah
B	mm
A	capped some and
B	mm
B	Cos Clare's step-mum had that recently
A	yeah
B	and it was horrendously painful
A	yeah
B	that's gonna happen?
A	yeah
B	mm
A	I mean er I will
B	mm
A	tut
B	lordy
A	hence my shit teeth now that decide to break very easily
B	tut
A	well then he said  he said  oh so it's gonna cost me a load of money
B	mm
A	I said
A	he was like yeah
B	like old people have
A	so he's actually considering
B	having er something that you take in and out
A	having a plate
B	mm
A	is it just me that can't understand how anybody anybody?
B	Cos I'd seen my nan's dentures
A	fall out
B	right well fucking A because then I can just get
B	replacement teeth
A	er great
B	awesome
A	yes
B	and you actually can't eat anything
A	yeah
B	no matter how good they say they are now
B	mm
A	two grand for an implant? Or a denture?
B	mm
A	er two grand thanks
B	yeah
A	I think
B	absolutely
A	no
B	you take in and out or you just have an implant
A	there is no case
B	so er the police will not give you a crime number
A	no
B	because there was no crime
A	definitely not
B	they came round and said you're a knob
A	yep
B	you told the paramedics that you fell
A	you're a twat
B	mm
A	and short
B	I think he's made this into a bigger deal for us to feel sorry for him
A	how? Er that can't have happened if he he could speak to the ambulance people
B	mm
A	that can't have actually happened
B	they were just playing silly silly buggers
B	er stealing around stealing bloody licence plate numbers and leaving them in here
A	yes
B	having a laugh aren't they
A	yeah
B	thought it was really funny cos why would they've put it in here? Like ha ha this'll be really really funny
A	yeah
B	like it's not
A	no
B	if they really thought that they'd grabbed it off a car then hit him they'd have kept it and given it to the police or something
A	yeah
B	you know
A	no
A	mm
B	mm
A	sick and wrong
B	tut
B	me?
A	er
B	probs
A	no
B	huh
A	and the rent wasn't bad either
B	and the what wasn't bad?

A	oh that guy in the dressing gown just said hey I guess you didn't like any of my pics then?
B	oh bless him
A	what do I reply to that? I'm just gonna put ha ha
