B	five fifty
A	yeah well that's okay I don't want her to sleep too long before bedtime
B	yeah
A	cos then she's
B	well do we need to go back first to put this stuff in the fridge?
A	I dunno there's only yogurts
B	well can you go for a walk like this or
A	I dunno it's a bit heavy
B	well what time did I say it was?
A	five fifty
B	five fifty?
A	yeah five zero what time is?
B	okay so we've only got an hour before she goes to bed
A	yeah I know but if she sleeps too long in
B	yeah
A	then er we'll be in trouble
B	yeah
A	she's managing to sleep longer at night
B	but she's going to bed a bit later
A	but now
B	mm
A	erm
B	mm
A	and er
B	yeah
A	or half one even
B	mm
A	so that's an added
B	mm
A	which and she's got up at an hour later too
B	mm
A	but that's because she went to bed late
B	uhu
A	I guess
B	mm
A	she was so predictable
B	yeah
A	why was I saying that? I've forgotten
B	I don't know
A	oh cos I don't want her to sleep too long now
B	but did you get
A	but
B	sorry to change subject
A	okay
A	I don't even know what I'm talking about
B	did you get that email from
A	no
B	oh apparently The Apprentice has started in the UK again
A	yeah okay
B	I've got something to download
A	I told him I they've got good memories haven't they?
B	I think he sent it to everyone
A	oh
A	well cos they we said in I said in passing oh yeah I really like The Apprentice I like to watch that like the only thing we used to stream isn't it?
B	yeah
A	didn't we used to wait for The
B	yeah
A	erm in
B	yeah
A	we used to wait for it and go it's Apprentice night tonight
A	we used to look forward to that
A	rather than watching like a series all the way
B	yeah
A	like have something to
B	so
A	that's a bit sad isn't it?
B	cos now we've got the er now we've got the proxy
A	we should be able to watch it
B	got the oh we can't watch it live can we?
A	we can watch it
B	cos it'll be like five o'clock in the morning but
A	is it Iplayer? is it BBC One or on
B	yeah Iplayer they is erm
A	mm
B	oh no it's
A	it
B	on ITV isn't it?
A	I don't know but Iplayer's a bit shit anyway
B	yeah it's on it's got adverts hasn't it? it's on
A	oh yeah
B	erm
A	I don't know
B	I dunno actually
A	yeah but Iplayer's just so slow
B	mm
A	anything on it it's rubbish
B	well it is from here yeah
A	yeah I don't think even from here I've
B	what's that red light up there?
A	mm?
B	is it?
A	it's the yeah
B	oh it is
A	it's a camera
B	must be an infrared
A	yeah look look look the infrared camera it's switched off now
B	oh
A	did you read in the paper in erm in Plymouth they've erm they've put these signs oh no not in the
B	mm
A	helmets or hats or
A	whatever
A	did you read about that?
B	no
A	and they have but they've had to put signs up in the areas that they're allowed to wear the cameras on their hats
B	what?
A	yeah there is
B	well why would you be allowed in one area but not another?
A	because people need a sign to say you are being recorded
B	well why don't they do that?
A	cos you're not allowed it
B	with every other camera?
A	that's a good point
B	well they do have signs saying CCTV cameras
A	yeah
B	things like that
A	are working in this area yeah
B	well it is I mean you don't have a
A	if they rob a bank then they'll get caught
B	I suppose you do have a choice if you see that sign
A	you see yeah
B	that no I'm not gonna go within five miles of the city centre
A	no you're right no
B	surely
A	no cos those signs are for if you're thinking about doing something
B	no
A	you might second think yourself and go
B	yeah
A	oh well there's a camera on me I'm gonna get caught aren't I so
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	let's not do it
B	so the real reason maybe that's what they're saying but the real reason is to make people aware that that's what they're doing
A	do you reckon that they're allowed in other places?
B	well it's an incremental step to condition people into accepting that that's normal practice
A	mm
B	there you go
A	why isn't the angel lit up
B	oh they've taken them all down look
A	oh
B	tut oh
A	I thought that was gonna be up er until Christmas
B	yeah
A	oh
B	well I suppose if it's always there you don't appreciate it
A	mm
B	it is kind of nice when it gets cold to put sparkly lights up
A	yeah
A	maybe they might put them up again
B	maybe
A	or we can take our own sparkly lights out there and plug in
A	the angel
A	right are we erm walking home? or
B	that's up to you
A	walking I don't mind walking a little bit erm I like to
B	we could walk around that block like we did last time
A	we could walk around the block yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	well we can walk over this bridge and then over the other bridge
A	we can't no no there's steps on the other bridges
B	is there?
A	this is the only bridge that there's no steps
B	okay
A	so you have to come back this way
B	we'll walk on the
A	yeah what? it's it's steps? we can't do steps
B	not steps
A	okay which side of the river?
B	the other side of the river
A	oh
B	yeah
A	but just to make things different we'll come back on that side of the bridge instead of that one
A	yeah this bag is quite
B	yeah
A	what on earth have you got in here?
B	I dunno
A	did did you spend twenty quid?
B	yeah
A	no it's
B	oh
A	and bleach I bought for the bathroom
B	mm
A	just for them to
B	mm
A	I'm not touching the bleach
B	so we've got a choice here
A	I hate bleach
B	we can walk down the cobbled bit
A	that's
B	we could walk on the cobbled bit now or we can walk back on the cobbled bit
A	well why don't we go up there and round there and around there and then back on
B	that's a big walk
A	okay we'll just do it let's let's just go on the cobbled bit now
B	okay
A	it's a bit wonky
B	er?
A	see I can't do this in in the other shoes
B	yeah
B	is she
A	but I like these evening walks
B	no I do
A	it's really nice around here like when it's not polluted
B	well this time of year is perfect
A	yeah it is
B	if it was like this all year
A	no I'd stay here a long time but
B	but for a few
A	yeah
B	more years
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	it'll be alright
B	er
A	I'm just hoping it doesn't get too polluted over the winter
B	mm
A	we must talk about that a lot mustn't we? do you think we do?
B	I think we probably talk about a lot of the same things on these things
A	maybe
B	so it doesn't really matter
A	maybe
B	doesn't matter maybe we should start reading newspaper articles or something
A	well I was supposed to be starting I've got to download all my course er things this weekend
B	oh
A	so that's my main thing to do this weekend and I'm signed up to three course er ones and I'm signing up to the corpus one on the other learning website
B	we can turn right here
A	okay
B	mm
A	I've got loads of
B	oh well I was
A	videos to download
B	I spoke to
A	yeah
B	and she said some of the the standards
A	yeah
B	of the of the conference people were shit
A	she told me the same yeah
B	she said you know like their PPTs were just full of words
A	yeah
B	them didn't and then and then they just turn around and read it
A	where are they from?
B	all over
A	oh do we have to go down this bit?
B	the world they were
A	but I don't wanna wake her up
B	oh
A	okay shh
B	to fly to
A	yeah
B	what a piss take
A	which they've botched together
B	which they've just thrown together about some bullshit
A	mm
B	it wasn't even a study they'd done and she said
A	I think it's a bit
B	a lot of it was just
A	disgraceful really
B	yeah
A	but I don't blame everybody for jumping on the bandwagon and
A	doing it
B	so
A	to
B	yeah
A	going
B	yeah
A	for a conference and getting flown there for free
B	yeah
A	and all he's got to do is show his
B	yeah I'm thinking maybe I'd I mean it's difficult
A	we need to
B	for us though with the baby
A	yeah but the some of these conferences
B	I could do it
A	are only yeah of course yeah we
B	I mean I could do one on my
A	we do need to do some research corpus
B	my corpus project
A	yeah
B	like twenty minutes? jesus man I
A	yeah
B	or was that twenty minutes? I can
A	no it was about twenty minutes I think
B	I could do the same thing with that
A	yeah
B	twenty minutes is nothing
A	yeah
B	we've been talking on this for about twenty minutes
A	mm
B	it's that's just crazy
A	yeah it is
B	to get flown around the world I think it's disgusting do they put you up in a hotel as well?
A	well I think so yeah they put yeah
B	yeah
A	that's what you should go for really
B	yeah
A	screw getting a PhD and stuff just do things like that where you can
B	how much time did you do you have though?
A	to what?
B	well I mean how much has
A	he's got about three or four days I think
B	yeah?
A	well I I don't know that they pay for the hotel for all of the days
B	mm
A	maybe the day before
B	mm
A	but erm
B	but your flights
A	but you've got your flight so you can
B	yeah
A	delay the flight
B	and just you could just pick out
A	and say well I want the flight at later on
B	you could just pick
A	yeah
B	I wanna go to Bogota and do a conference for twenty minutes
A	crazy
B	it is a crazy
A	but with us we'd have to
B	mm
A	both go but then you've got the problem of erm who's gonna like if we've got the same sort of time
B	mm
A	but surely
B	mm
A	time slot
B	mm
A	I'm sure they'd work that out you only have to do
B	yeah
A	you don't even have to give your
B	really?
A	no you can just write an abstract
A	two days before
A	it's ridiculous
B	it is it's it is ridiculous
A	it's sad really
B	it's a sham isn't it?
A	all that money yeah it is a bit but take advantage you know
B	yeah but it is difficult for us now
A	yeah but it's nice to have some
B	I mean you wouldn't be able to do it at all
A	why?
B	what would you do with a baby?
A	well I can do it next year or so when she's not breastfeeding
B	yeah
A	and just mind you I'd be
B	yeah
A	I'm quite attached aren't I? I think it would be quite hard
B	cos I
A	for me to go away for even two days
B	yeah but I don't know if I'd wanna go away either really
A	no
B	for a week cos I would have to do it
A	but
B	wouldn't be able to do it in term time
A	now are we allowed to go behind these ones here? hopefully
B	yeah
A	er?
B	yeah
A	but I showed
B	well what did she say?
A	she said she'd go down the steps now
B	yeah but the ones above the steps are just as bad
A	well at least yeah but at least you're not following a great big line of them you're just going over that bit of it
B	I don't know why they just don't remove them
A	yeah get rid of them
B	it's just dangerous there
A	they need to put some
B	yeah have you got your card?
A	no
B	ah
A	yeah
