D	oh wow
A	they're really cute
A	how did she?
C	it's like a pillowslip like
unknown	yeah
C	erm way you're doing it
A	you only have to sew two up so that's clever
B	yeah so you have to do the zip the zip and stuff
A	yeah
B	and you can take them off easily
A	that's really clever
C	I don't know how easy it is to take off well we haven't
B	frilly edge as well I
A	ah
D	ah
B	what that was all about though
A	that's very good
C	well we like got the material cos we were gonna like make like turn the top over that and like me a book stool sort of thing
A	yeah
C	like put a cushiony bit on
A	yeah
C	but we were like oh god no
B	it was it was like mummy made it so we could just
C	it's good cos it like the material didn't go to waste
A	no
C	as in
B	I know but we
A	but it's great
D	and I'm sure you'd find a use for it at some point
unknown	yeah
C	but neither of us can't sew or anything unless it's hand sewing
B	yeah I can probably do that
D	so hand sew
B	but
A	mm
B	right so how have you guys been then?
A	yeah
D	yeah good
B	yeah?
A	well as as good as January could be
unknown	yeah
D	yeah I'm so glad to be out of it
A	yeah
B	key isn't it like?
A	it's just a gloomy month I haven't really done a great deal to be honest
B	no
A	well I've gone back to Zumba though which I'm quite enjoying
B	oh that's good
C	oh good
A	where are you doing that?
A	erm in
[ANNOTATION]	person A is not sure about location	Entailment
B	oh right is it like a at a gym or is it?
A	erm yeah it's like
B	yeah that's what we've got yeah
A	gym swim or whatever so I'm like oh I might as well
B	you might as well
A	pay the extra ten quid and be able to use the gym
B	you may as well yeah
A	and obviously the pool as well
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	and actually I think like we can get a joint membership for like fifty-three quid or something so like even better
B	yeah they do that don't like? like couples type
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about gym	Entailment
A	yeah
B	cos we were gonna go on one at a different gym but then the gym we were at offered nothing in comparison to the one
C	a leisure
A	yeah
B	it was like a leisure centre with a spin no not even a spin room just like a hall that they
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about a film	Contradiction
A	yeah
B	that they put stuff in
A	yeah
B	yeah sure
A	when I first moved it was like the last thing on my mind
B	yeah
A	and I really just couldn't be bothered and now like I'm like yeah I really wanna like
B	yeah
A	get back into it and I know
B	yeah
C	it's good if you've got someone else like to do it with
[ANNOTATION]	person B is talking about football	Contradiction
A	yeah
unknown	yeah
C	yeah as well
A	yeah I think so and he'll be able to help cos like I really want to like not in like a weird bodybuilder muscly way but I really wanna do like proper like strength training and weight training
B	weights yeah
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about weather	Contradiction
A	and weight training and obviously he knows all about stuff so
B	yeah
D	that's really good
A	it should be quite cool cos like I know you can lose so much weight if you do like weight training
B	yeah
A	because like you just rather than simply like losing the fat you can burn it to like muscle so like
C	yeah
A	it tones you as you're kind of losing weight
C	yeah it's like it's a lot less I know it sounds like it's a lot less effort than like
A	yeah
C	doing all the cardio
A	yeah
B	just on the bloody rowing machine
C	yeah or and stuff like that
A	exactly
C	cos it's boring
A	it is boring
A	yeah
C	a lot of the time and we were doing the odd weights like that we'd had from
A	yeah
C	erm but we were just like we were getting a bit bored with it so me and
A	yeah
C	erm combat which is like a cardio kettlebells which is like conditioning and stuff
A	yeah
C	so we're doing a good mix really
A	kettlebells looks really cool actually
C	yeah
A	are you enjoying it?
C	yeah
B	it's so hard
C	if you have you tried it?
A	no
C	oh
A	no they
C	yeah
A	really?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	obviously momentum and stuff and like you can up your weights quite quickly because
C	yeah
B	like we were doing a move the other day and I was like and you probably wanna try a heavier weight on this cos we were just
B	and like cos we we are in the beginners' class still but I really like it I think
A	yeah
B	like it's a good one and you get really
A	yeah
B	it's actually
C	about do it for half an hour
B	yeah
C	and you get so sweaty like
A	yeah
C	once cos that like ours is a bit
D	yeah
C	you keep going over the same things but you
B	you can still have a good workout
C	even so you can just up your weights to make it
A	yeah
C	harder and it's hard enough like without doing all these fancy
A	yeah
C	and it's actually like a mixture of it's cardio
D	weights
C	raw cardio
D	yeah
B	yeah
C	like so it's really it's just getting in it
B	yeah
A	well yeah
C	yeah and it's just something about it that's like
A	yeah
C	I'm gonna try erm body balance as well cos like t'ai chi like
A	yeah
C	all of that sort no
A	that's just meant to be really good for your core
C	it's Pilates and stuff like that
A	like all the balance stuff
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	sort of my back gets a bit dodgy like
A	yeah
C	if I'm doing like on my back and stuff so
A	yeah
B	we should find that out next week
C	me and
A	that's really good
C	which it we've been like so we've been well
A	yeah
C	and we've built like
A	at this time of year as well there's not a lot much
D	else no
A	like you else to do yeah
C	no
A	like as well
D	I was thinking the other day cos I've got I finished on slightly earlier I was driving back and it was really bright cos it was just in the middle of the day and it was like this is what it'll be like like oh in summer and I'm thinking
C	I know
D	what can we do this evening?
C	yeah
A	yeah
D	at the moment I'm just like get back
C	it it's like a
D	eat food go to bed
C	it's was a little bit lighter yesterday
A	yeah
C	like when we were driving home it was like I can't wait to
A	I know
D	yeah but that just
C	that like sounds better you know?
D	sun it's vitamin D it's
C	yeah
D	just wanna get out there
C	it's so much nicer isn't it?
A	yeah it makes such a big difference
B	just like happier aren't you though?
C	yeah cos we come out the gym when it's dark we go in when it's dark and we come out when it's dark and it's just like er so it'll be nice when we're like when it's light
A	yeah
C	to like to be like feeling good
B	and you've still got like
B	yeah you've
D	you've got the evening evening
B	well exactly do you guys want erm
A	I do
C	no yeah we might as well
A	yeah
B	yeah we're erm we're going to like our friend's party tonight like it's not a party party
C	it's like a gathering
B	er yeah a gathering it's like erm his house was in a magazine
A	oh really?
B	erm cos it's like really fifties and it's really really nice
A	yeah
B	and they decorated it really well so he's having a gathering and like a little celebration so I'm doing
A	oh that's quite cute
B	I'm just like are we not going to be able to bring the
C	but like this apparently there's going to be enough booze for it
A	oh that's really cool
C	I'm excited to see the house like it's really nicely decorated
D	yeah that's cool
C	and they've got like erm just from the pictures that we've seen in the magazine like they've got like a fireplace in one of the bedrooms and it's like bright yellow? like with all the black like in the middle and stuff and
B	it looks so cool
C	it just yeah they've done it really well
B	yeah
C	but
D	get ideas
C	they had quite a few like they had like a couple of spreads of the house in magazines they were in which was really good
D	how do you get noticed for that
C	I think it's photographers that like bring
A	yeah
C	I've got these photos
D	oh
C	see what I mean? so
A	that's quite cool
C	it's just like word of mouth really
A	yeah
C	yeah and and like the
B	I'll
C	should be good
C	I mean we did it last time didn't we?
B	there's work on the horizon
D	it has calmed down a bit for me
A	has it?
D	probably next week
C	oh
B	oh
D	no that's if they're like I'm just like got two weeks and I'm on holiday then
A	crazy
D	stuff yeah
A	all all exciting
D	how's work for you?
A	it's not too bad
C	a nightmare
A	yeah the whole of January it's just been so bad
C	that's
A	yeah I know
A	I left I left
D	it's the weather isn't it?
A	yeah I think so
B	oh yeah that's true
A	I
A	so that's kind of pissed me off recently erm
B	it just makes the day so long
A	yeah well you get to work and you're already pissed off
C	yeah and it's not a good start is it?
A	it's not a good start to the day when you get to work and you think right I've been up two and a half hours already brilliant
C	oh
A	so that's not been very fun
B	yeah
A	it's just not worth it spending like four hours of your day driving
B	no
A	not worth it
C	maybe it'll just
D	it seems so weird like
A	I know
C	so expensive it's just ridiculous isn't it?
A	yeah like it would cost me like twice as much to like get the train and it's just not worth it
C	especially when you like you're paying for the car as well
A	exactly and the thing is as well like obviously like as soon as you start like using public transport like you're really tied down to like only being able to get transport at certain times so like your whole time is like pinned around like
C	that's
A	those schedules
C	that's even more stressful isn't it?
A	yeah
C	as well like when you've got I mean you can like if you leave a bit later you can
A	exactly
C	but I've got to make sure I get there on time type of thing but if your
A	exactly
C	you can't
A	yeah if you're in the middle of something and stuff like that it means you have to go and get a train and all like
C	yeah
A	so like to get in I can either get like a quarter past seven or a quarter past eight train and then to get home I can either get the four or five o'clock train
C	yeah
B	do you stay behind at work much?
A	not really like none
B	yeah
A	it's not very often that something needs to be done like that day
B	like yeah
A	I can normally say
B	that's good though isn't it?
A	yeah which is nice like so it's not the job itself isn't stressful I actually
B	yeah
A	really enjoy it
B	yeah
A	so
B	well that's good
A	I've been getting involved in like quite a few of our projects and stuff which is a lot more interesting but
B	mm
A	so we'll see I'm just gonna kind of like going with it and seeing what happens
B	yeah
A	and keeping my options open
B	how long have you been there now?
A	about eight months
B	yeah
A	so obviously I'd er I'd like to I'd like to stay there a bit longer and see what happens but it's hard like
B	yeah
A	and then even like when I get home I could get home at about half six seven o'clock and like if
B	yeah
A	I've driven to work and I've driven home from work
B	yeah
A	then I'm eating like that's it great it's like time for bed
B	yeah
A	so
B	not enough time in the day is there?
A	no it's a bit depressing
B	yeah
A	but yeah I'm hoping as the weather gets better like so will the traffic but
B	yeah
A	it's just like I've got two cities either end of my journey and then the shitty A14 in between so like
B	yeah
A	basically
B	yeah
A	at half seven in the morning and I was like really?
B	oh horrible
A	and like last Thursday it took me two hours to get home and like part of the A14 was actually closed so I had to take some like sketchy backroads like around
B	oh god
A	it's not fun and like actually like last Thursday really pissed me off because like it always it's always like it's really really hard to
B	yeah
A	so like we we either like
B	yeah
A	and doing all that kind of stuff or we agree to go somewhere else in which case I have to say look I probably won't be there till half past seven like
B	yeah
A	that's the earliest I'm gonna get anywhere
B	yeah
A	and that's quite late to be meeting someone to like have dinner or whatever
D	it probably feels late er like I said because it's grim and winter months
A	yeah
D	and it's so dark and dingy at
A	yeah
D	at four o'clock
A	and turning up at someone's house at half seven asking to be fed just seems a bit
B	mm
A	rude like but
B	oh
A	as I arrived like fortunately as I arrived the pizza arrived and erm it was like we'd gone to see like a I don't know if
B	oh that's good
A	so erm obviously like
B	mm
A	and then just like Sod's law like why should it like it took me two hours to get home on the night that I have plans
B	yeah that's just
D	driving is
C	no way?
D	slowing down to look
B	what?
D	and what had happened is the front of the car had been clipped by a lorry at it so er this is the lorry here the car was like this sideways on
B	oh
D	like that and I like from where I saw it it looked like the driver in the lorry had his head on the wheel
A	taking a deep breath
D	but like then I was driving on and then I saw a fire engine go by then I saw the two ambulances and the police car so they had gone all the way to I don't know where this was
C	at the nearest exit
D	they had to go all the way up to
A	yeah
D	turn round to come back on the other side of the A1
A	yeah
D	to get to it and then through the traffic as well cos it was on the other side
A	yeah
B	oh god
D	that looked bad
A	not fun
B	no
A	that's the worst part of it but yeah it is it is frustrating cos I like being there I like the company and I like the team and I like my job and stuff but
D	yeah
A	driving all that way
D	yeah
A	to to the work
D	yeah
A	so
B	yeah
A	are you guys still enjoying yourselves?
C	what where?
B	yeah yeah
A	yeah
B	helping out with people and stuff and like there's not much satisfaction in that
A	yeah
B	sort of thing like
A	yeah
B	then we'll go onto the spring
A	no
B	so
A	yeah
B	so if you get on the good projects and stuff it'll be alright but
A	yeah
B	it does kind of by the time it gets round to do doing Christmas again we've kind of gone out to
A	yeah
B	plan it sort of thing and just get on with it and you've got targets so
A	what do you do about like things like birthdays? are they just kind of
B	we
A	going on the background? or like
B	well erm
A	yeah
B	like birthdays and stuff but they do that in the studios
C	yeah or like
B	just
A	yeah
B	but we were helping out with that and
A	yeah
B	when we've been waiting for pieces and stuff so we do have to get on really with
A	yeah
C	and like everyone else is quite because they're like designing they're not very fast with it or
C	like they can take their time but we can't cos you've got a real target
A	yeah
C	so like
A	yeah
C	but we do a good job so
B	yeah it's alright like
D	but you get on with him don't you?
B	he's better than we've had
D	yeah
C	yeah
B	yeah we do
A	that's good
B	I can't complain too much
A	the lesser of two evils
B	yeah
C	can't really complain although we do all the time
B	we do
D	I do I have a complain once a day
A	yeah is she still annoying?
D	yes
A	really?
D	yeah well but I was out Monday and Friday and they were the only two days she was in the office
C	was your friend there or is that a different person?
D	that's a
B	but she's now come to realise that
D	our boss is a bit of a
B	mm
D	she's a compulsive liar
A	yeah
D	like to the point where she actually believes herself and like I'm nice I'm nice when you get her on her own and you're not talking about work and you're away from it I like the person
B	does anyone want a bit of chocolate while we're waiting?
D	yeah
C	it's just gonna be a second
A	were you here when
C	no
D	my boss
B	do you know how much you made?
D	yeah my friend
B	yeah
D	brought it in
B	what was it
B	okay yeah
D	that
C	what?
D	how fucked is that?
C	that's weird
B	so it was somebody else's cake?
A	yeah
B	what the fuck?
B	that's so weird
C	but
D	no I was I was just laughing
A	mm
C	that's weird like that's like psychotic
B	I think people need help if they're doing that
D	I know
A	like what what purpose would that serve?
D	but it's opened my eyes to everything else that she lies about
A	yeah
D	once she'd actually been caught out you second question about everything when she she says she's going to a
A	she sounds dodgy as
B	yeah that sounds so
C	it's weird cos erm and our friend
A	yeah
C	and like she the person that the girl was saying that had told her a story erm I was going to
B	but I didn't I didn't hear the story
C	like
A	yeah
C	like what during Christmas he did something with a turkey or something
C	but it was actually
B	who she was living with
C	the girl she was staying with
D	so it was her story?
C	cos
D	from her
C	from the lady that she used to live with
D	that's what it's like that is
C	it's weird like
D	exactly what she's like
A	I just don't get like they're those kind of people are just compulsive liars aren't they?
C	yeah
B	it's
C	it's completely overlooked
B	and they lie about everything
A	yeah
B	like say you know like you know who they are
C	yeah
D	that's why it is so annoying like cos you don't really get the full story about what's happening cos she's meant to be leading the team like
D	but she gives you half the story then someone else in a different department will say have they're all they're like oh have you started this? and I'm like don't know about it they're like oh we told
B	oh god
D	and it's really embarrassing
A	yeah
D	she'll throw us into the
B	yeah
A	that's so annoying
D	but
A	yeah
D	absolutely
D	it irritates me she's hardly in the office I don't actually know what she's working on and she's on a fucking
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	that's really that's the most annoying
A	that's taking the piss isn't it?
D	she's probably on like fifty fifty-five thousand a year
B	yeah
A	I swear though I think sometimes I think that about a lot of managers like if you get to a certain level there's so much you can bullshit like
B	yeah exactly
A	you don't have to do anything
B	that's what our manager's like
C	that's what our manager's like
D	well I'd hope she would direct better and manage her budget better
A	yeah
D	but she doesn't manage her budget and she's not directing so I don't know what the fuck she's doing
B	mm
C	I I got a card back from er when I
C	some artwork on some
C	and then it was like oh yeah I was like oh it was good job I was listening as I wouldn't have changed it and then it would have come back to me
B	yeah and then it would be on your back
C	like he's just lazy he doesn't write anything down
B	I've had that with him as well
C	I'm just like erm you're not actually doing the job
B	like I could do his job quite easily and getting whatever for it
C	it's getting like I think we're
B	there's no one like there to like say that
B	a bit of encouragement
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	really break it up and
A	some direction
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	like we've got this many to do guys like you're doing a really good job like and all that sort of cos we do do a good job within our means but there's only so much we can do erm and like if we get
B	like I dunno just like a bit of
A	yeah
B	like
B	I think they're stupid
C	yeah well they are where we work
D	a means to an end guys work is a means to an end
A	you go to work to earn the money so you can do whatever it is
C	yeah true
D	what is this?
C	oh
D	you upgraded?
C	did we not have it when I saw you?
B	six months
D	did you? no maybe you did
B	oh no we wouldn't have
D	bloody hell
B	six months innit?
D	you went for it
C	mm
D	big
C	it's no different to
B	I
D	but the seat isn't that big is it?
A	I like I like your poster
C	it's from the exhibition we did
D	it's good to look at that online and stuff
C	cos like I I don't really like just put it in your pocket
A	yeah
C	or anything like that so it doesn't need to be small
D	no
C	do you know what I mean? and like
D	it's like a little Ipad
C	yeah so I thought it was a bit sort of in-betweeny
D	but what cos I like
C	it's interesting
B	that was one of the first
C	it wasn't very good
B	like cos you see everything like those bigger as well like on Instagram
D	I had to learn how to do
D	I think I'd really get into projects then oh that house looks nice
B	good like
D	yeah
B	I need to get
D	I have an account and I haven't been
B	I've got some more ideas here
C	mm
A	oh yeah I've never like I have phases where I'll like have a little play and then I'll like not go on it in ages it's just ridiculous
B	like that's where like
B	everyone gets everything from
D	do you
C	we've been given like the opportunity to like maybe decorate our studios cos they're just like new offices
A	yeah
C	and they haven't been and obviously like not inspirational at all so obviously we've been starting to look on there and like obviously we're probably gonna have to do a lot of it ourselves and stuff
A	mm
C	but I think it'll be quite cool
A	that's cool mm
C	like cos I loads of like places in like New York and stuff all industrial buildings and like
A	yeah
C	really cool stuff but
B	we just need to relocate
C	yeah relocate
C	oh god
C	like dance and like
D	especially when they don't sometimes use words and they don't know what they're talking about
B	yeah
C	or like you know on like Big Fat Gypsy Wedding and stuff
D	yeah
C	and they're little girls dancing like that it's horrible
B	that's just scary
C	isn't it?
A	wow
D	I don't think the one sister does much
A	yeah and she's a lot younger though isn't she?
C	yeah
B	I know but then why would she go on?
A	she just
B	mm
A	how's
B	okay good
A	all sorted?
B	erm yeah I think
A	yeah
C	and er like we've got some seating now and
B	mm
A	yeah
B	and she's got her shoes
C	he's only just picked his best man
B	yeah he's only just picked his best
A	oh yeah who
D	who has he gone for?
C	he went for
D	ah
C	er we had a meeting with
A	yeah
C	er properly
A	that's cool
C	which is exciting
B	it's at eleven her ceremony
A	oh is it?
C	yeah so it's like
A	that is early
C	erm like her sister's obviously she doesn't know whether she's got to photograph the men yet
A	yeah
C	before like usually before like usually it's all about the bride
B	we're gonna be in completely different places as well so it's just gonna
C	we'll be at
B	at
C	and we don't know where
A	yeah
C	like
B	so that they're like only just obviously sorting out who wants to go on their stag do and stuff like that
A	yeah
B	so
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	we went we
D	would be I'd be scared
A	well yeah because
B	yeah
A	er I imagine what it
C	yeah
A	and then obviously
C	yeah
A	take some pictures of the
C	of the men
A	groomsmen and everything
C	yeah yeah and then she might she'll need to get to like
B	a few snaps
C	to get a few snaps of it without anyone in it and stuff
A	yeah
C	and then obviously
B	then they'll have
C	the
B	I don't know how it's gonna work
C	before it all gets ruined
B	yeah
C	so it's like
A	busy day for her then as well
B	yeah like she's quite excited about it cos I thought she'd be a bit worried but she's fine so
A	yeah
B	she did a really nice one erm
A	yeah
B	and like she was the photographer and like she went she had like a holiday and it was very sunny
C	it was
B	yeah it was at
A	yeah
B	it was like really nice like so I think hopefully the weather will be alright
A	yeah
C	alright?
A	that'll be nice
B	yeah
C	I feel like I should make more of these
B	but erm
D	pregnant yeah
B	yeah so and she
A	well she she
B	she's like ready to pop in like
A	like announced it to the entire Facebook message
B	yeah
A	and I was like er even like I was just like I just thought it was really weird
D	I saw it first on Instagram
C	oh yeah
D	when she did that little heart over her belly
A	oh see like I don't I don't have any contact with her whatsoever
D	no
A	and I just thought like I don't need to know that you're pregnant like that just seemed really like attention-seeking and I was just like
B	yeah
A	go away
C	but like she's like due like third of August I think the first of August now I think so like obviously
B	that's really close to
D	yeah
C	but
B	she
A	yeah that's not
B	well she's gonna be huge in June won't she?
D	might be
C	yeah she was concerned because like she like we were like literally you can't not come because it's gonna make it expensive for everybody else like or
D	but it's the one thing she can still come to though that's the thing isn't it?
C	I know like I would said like
B	she was already
B	she was a replacement
C	planned loads of stuff like so we had to like kind of let's do it separately
A	yeah
C	but she's been really nice like and she's like
A	what's her name?
C	er
B	she seems
C	but it's like
A	yeah I
B	I like our friend
A	oh that's so annoying
B	you need to know what's happening she was like so
C	what
B	and I'm like what?
A	I'm just like really easygoing about it though like I'm just happy to go with whatever
D	yeah I've got it on my diary now so
A	yeah
C	I think we're just
D	it's on the calendar
C	like worried like and telling everybody everything because we want everyone to know exactly what they're getting into how much they're gonna be spending because it's gonna be expensive for
A	yeah
C	it is and it isn't I think like it's difficult to kind of
A	yeah
C	like for a few nights and like
A	I think
C	and drink and things
A	I think I think you're getting some resistance from people that have done the hen do thing before like
B	mm
A	because I think once you've done a couple it is expensive
C	yeah yeah
A	but like
C	yeah
A	like like I I know they perhaps don't wanna upset the bride by not going but like I just think it's one of those things like
C	you just have to do it
A	yeah
C	I mean we've been quite open like yeah it's probably gonna be around two hundred pounds
A	yeah
C	er and like
B	like it could be more
A	I that's not expensive I don't think
B	no and like especially like where it is where we're staying we've booked a nice place and obviously it is like with the
C	but that's a choice isn't it at the end of the day?
B	yeah
C	you could make it cheaper
A	yeah
C	and we're we're thinking we're like everybody take their own drinks erm
B	yeah you can
C	so everybody's like so it's not like oh I bought that drink and so you can't have that do you know what I mean? and stuff like that
A	yeah
C	erm
B	yeah so we're thinking like people are gonna drink different stuff
A	yeah
C	and different amounts as well
B	but we'll do we'll make sure
A	and especially if you've got people who aren't drinking
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	but erm and like we were worried about like
A	oh right
C	so she's gonna get her own we're gonna sort of say what we're thinking about eating
A	yeah
C	and then she's gonna get her own stuff cos the thing is it's a little bit more expensive as well so
A	it is yeah
C	so we said it wasn't fair for
A	yeah
C	er which was handy so
A	yeah
C	but we thought with the pizza-making that would be quite nice because
A	yeah
C	like people
A	yeah exactly
A	exactly
C	and like that'll be a nice sort of
A	yeah
B	I think
C	use all the little
B	if it all goes to plan it'll be really nice
C	yeah
A	I think it'll be a lovely weekend
C	and it's a bit annoying that it's quite far away but then
A	yeah
C	technically I feel like it's our like job like job to kind of organisation everything
B	make it as efficient
A	yeah and also make sure you don't have like twenty cars turning up
B	yeah
A	cos everybody's driven separately
B	yeah so that's what we we are trying to do yeah
D	I'll obviously be in
A	yeah
D	anyone else is in this area
C	yeah so we'll have to cos like and we'll try and put like cos like like
B	so we don't know who's gonna
C	like who's gonna take thingy and like obviously we're all here so you probably we're further over so
D	which way are we going from
C	I don't know yet
A	I don't know where it is that I'm sorry
C	well it's like south it's like edge of Wales so
A	oh right
A	it's the west
B	further there
A	yeah I mean we probably would be coming this way then heading towards
D	yeah yeah yeah yeah that makes sense
C	yeah so like
B	so east
C	erm
A	yeah
C	like obviously we'd try and do it from here so we didn't really think about people who have extra way to go but thing is we were looking at places in like Norfolk and stuff
D	is the
C	which is a little bit closer
A	yeah
C	but like
B	it's so expensive
C	they're all so expensive it was like
A	yeah
C	four thousand pounds or
B	Norfolk is such an expensive place
C	like so we kind of like
B	thing is I think
C	I know the petrol will be a bit but
B	we were so
C	it's a bit too
B	like we really like the place as well like that was one of the best places we found as well
D	it's really nice
B	like so we thought it's worth going a bit further for it but like and then just make it nice cos we're not really doing that much so I mean it'll be somewhere really nice
A	how many of us are there?
B	fifteen
A	yeah
B	where we are cos it's a bit of a waste if not like you're just in a house sort of thing and then obviously people have suggested doing like a treasure hunt which is really really hard we won't have anything to
A	that's what I said I'm not I'm not sure of the logistics of that
B	no
A	I mean
B	I
A	you know the kind of treasure hunt we organised? that might work where you say oh you have to go and find
D	this and find
A	this and find that
B	mm
A	find this that might work
B	yeah
A	but the way she like it almost sounded like she was gonna write clues and stuff which I just didn't really understand
B	and like
B	it's going a bit airy you can't be like oh this is
A	yeah
B	you know what I mean like? and
C	I'd rather be
D	but may just well do it in the house
unknown	yeah
A	bloody raining
B	I was like I was expecting it to be fucking well hot and
D	at least mild then
A	even if it's raining
C	yeah
A	it's not gonna be like cold like
C	yeah I
A	like even it was like
D	that's right yeah
B	it's a bit annoying as well because we had obviously suggested doing an afternoon tea at the house just to
A	yeah
B	just to keep costs down cos I mean we can do that on I dunno
A	yeah
B	like a big scale like for cheaper but then obviously
D	on the way home
B	to a to a tearoom or something
A	yeah
B	but like I'm just trying to keep costs down and stuff and like obviously we've already mentioned the afternoon tea thing and like
A	yeah
B	it was kind of like cos I wanna take people like ideas into consideration but we have thought about a lot of it already
A	yeah
C	but we're not gonna have loads of time
B	there's so much to do it's like quite funny getting quite packed up I think
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b wants to save money to buy a horse	Neutral
A	I think
B	we'll have to start
C	cos technically we've only got two full days really
[ANNOTATION]	there are a lot of things that need to be done	Entailment
B	yeah

B	well we do
D	well I was throwing up in her mum's bathroom and there was towels all over and I used them so I like

B	although
D	I used to be
B	I think what would be quite
A	yeah
B	nice there is like a memory game like you write down a memory with

B	erm and then
C	it's quite hard cos she's
D	oh and she writes them out you give a memory of when

D	that sounds good
C	that's quite nice isn't it?
D	my old er we'll do that one then
A	that's great
C	I don't know if I could think of one actually
B	I can't pinpoint anything
C	no
A	mine would be like really old I imagine

D	that would be good though cos then she's gonna
C	I think it's better that they're
D	then she's gonna need
A	yeah like I remember I remember like
D	yeah
A	at the back of the
C	oh
A	and like we never hung out in there

C	no
A	like it feels really rude to like kind of say oh I'm not gonna make any effort anymore but you get to a point where you just think I actually cannot be bothered anymore
B	yes
A	like
C	it is fine though cos we're quite good friends with
A	yeah
C	we've always been
B	yeah I don't wanna like leave him as a friend obviously I'm sure when we do see him it'll just be like
C	normal
B	how it's always been

C	it's just like
C	but thing is like he's not he can't be that busy
A	no

A	you might recognise him if you saw him erm we were gonna go to Paris where
D	they'd said that at the beginning
A	yeah exactly and it's a bit like it obviously is gonna make things really expensive for us now cos we have to make our own travel arrangements
D	yeah
A	and we'll just
D	and like with a marathon it might be already quite
D	yeah that would be so cool
A	yeah
D	you said in the car
A	yeah and like they they're going to Reykjavik for his birthday apparently
D	oh where's fucking Reykjavik?
A	it's in Iceland but like I've said I'd really wanna go like I've made it like even
D	quite clear
A	as soon as
D	is that where you see the northern lights?
A	yeah
D	that I just go I always hear oh we saw the northern lights but I've no idea where they are
A	yeah the aurora borealis
B	I'd like to do that
A	or whatever it is yeah like I really wanna go and like
B	that's so cool
A	when she told me that I was just like right so you're gonna go to Paris and you're gonna go to Reykjavik and you guys are just doing it I'm like fine we're gonna go somewhere else
D	Reykjavik
A	we're gonna er that I'm gonna er there's so many places I wanna go and they're like really fucking random like I really wanna go to Poland I don't know why I just do Denmark
D	I really want to
A	Croatia
D	go it sounds really awful but I want to go to Auschwitz
A	Auschwitz really?
D	really badly
A	I I
B	I would but I'd be
A	it would be really sad but it would be
D	I know it would be really sad I'd probably cry the whole way round but I feel like I want to go
A	it would be worth it I really wanna do Amsterdam actually like
D	yeah
A	when
D	they had a good time
A	they said they had a great time like I'd love to go
B	can't afford it on fucking Fridays
A	yeah do wanna do like Budapest and Prague I haven't seen much of Europe so I'm dying to do it and still still got my heart set on doing that trip in Italy at some point like
D	I know mum was clearing out a wardrobe she said so I said you know I don't need any of it? she said
A	yeah at the same
D	but
A	yeah I was saying to
D	to go
A	at some point
D	yeah
A	I was like I can't I said we've planned a really good trip I was like what we should do cos I haven't spoken to
D	yeah
A	all four of us should go I was like I I was like I'll have to speak to
D	yeah
A	but yeah I'd love still love to go to Italy
D	must do it
A	so there's loads of places we're gonna have a little look
D	that's what I mean I might think about that if I haven't got anything to do for this year I don't think I've got
D	but I might and that's my next just do weekends away to different erm
A	yeah
D	there's a guy at work he is you know he's national sales director but he can't stand not doing anything on the weekend and he's just like just flying to so-and-so for the weekend
A	yeah
D	I'll be back back at work on Monday
A	yeah
D	you know it's Friday night he's back to be in work on Monday morning
A	yeah a couple like a couple of people at work like when I was asking them about like for suggestions and stuff they just had so many places they'd been on I was like you guys are really well-travelled and they're just like well it's cheaper than you think it is to go away for a weekend like not if you pick the massive tourist destinations but if you pick somewhere a little bit more obscure you can fly out there for forty or fifty quid like stay in a B and B like it doesn't have to be expensive
D	no
A	especially when you look at how expensive it is to go away for the weekend in the UK sometimes
D	yeah
A	so like I like my my uni friends were like oh why don't you go away for one of the bank holiday weekends in May? so I started having a look and you can go to like Warsaw in Poland for like a hundred and fifteen pound per person for three days three nights
C	that's a great deal that's so good
A	yeah
C	oh
A	get a fucking grip it's three nights like
C	yeah
A	and like this
C	you're not gonna live there
A	this place was like a hundred and fifteen quid for three nights for eight people
D	no
A	like does it matter if it's a shithole? you're not gonna
B	I mean if you're going for three nights
A	exactly you're gonna out all day and probably out most of the night while you're staying there she
A	yeah
D	you can just get the tram and you're in
A	yeah
D	two minutes and erm he was and he texted the best man and they were like already on it so they're staying at that hostel and
A	I thought it was really good
D	I thought it was really good
A	I'm I've I've looked at them since cos like obviously they have places
D	one in
A	all over Europe
D	yeah
A	like they're definite like I would trust staying there again cos I was pleasantly surprised and the thing with a hostel is I think if you book the whole dorm
D	dorm there's no problem
A	there's no
B	yeah
A	and that's what I don't get about like when we've been away with the girls I know I like the idea of having an apartment and you can cook and all that kind of stuff but if you really wanted to it's so cheap to stay in a hostel and there's always enough of us to book a whole room
D	exactly
A	and we spend so little time in there like when we went up to
D	yeah
A	like
D	mm
A	it's those just those weekends get so expensive because you've obviously got to travel accommodation but then even your night out costs you a small fortune
D	and your food
A	yeah
B	I think it would be better if you like didn't necessarily go out
A	yeah
B	like cos you could spend that money doing like seeing
A	you could do all sorts
D	yeah
A	and then they wanted to go out for like a full-on night out and I was just like
B	you don't need to do that though do you though?
D	it kind of
A	yeah
D	a little bit
C	everybody was really like if we'd have gone straight out when we went er it would have been fine
D	it would have been better to go out early have cocktails and stuff
A	yeah
D	then go and watch the thing and then go home
A	yeah exactly
B	yeah
A	but you know like I think a lot of them are still in denial a little bit in that like
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	do you know it pissed me off when we were in
B	we're going now
A	I wanna I wanna go home now?
A	and then everybody else coincidentally goes oh yeah
A	if
B	yeah
A	like it's like
A	yeah
D	well yeah
A	and I just like it's just one of those things
D	cos they were going in and out in and out having a fag
A	yeah
D	and I just said to
A	yeah
D	so we did and we when we went and sat down and waiting then
B	yeah
D	and I said and I said to her if we get in a taxi to go somewhere
B	yeah
D	if you stay in this one bar and to see it out people are more likely to stay a bit longer but
A	but I didn't really get it cos like it was so badly organised because clearly
D	and then try and pick yourself up again
A	exactly
B	I don't think understand why you have to like a massive
A	I like the idea of getting away
D	but it's you know if you listen to stories
A	but yeah
D	the best things all happen when they get back to the hotel or
A	yeah
D	when you're on the street or something
B	it's true
A	I do like
D	that would be really nice
A	which I I think that sounds lovely but all she's on about is like going up there
B	drink having a drink and then
A	and getting pissed and I'm like no if I go to
B	yeah like you'd have
C	yeah
A	it would be really yeah that was really nice
D	yeah that was really nice
A	and like er there's loads of places round like in
D	yeah
A	like I know the area so much better now like I know like there's erm there's this orchard at
B	oh
A	and I'm like oh that sounds lovely
D	there's something else up there
A	really nice
D	near near there I can't remember what it's called it begins with F
A	there's
B	yeah
C	like we went to er was it? where did we
B	yeah
C	and like that was really nice
A	yeah
C	and we just walked round and went and come here and like we didn't have
A	yeah
