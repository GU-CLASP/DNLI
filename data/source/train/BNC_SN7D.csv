A	it was on eh it was for
B	yeah
A	eh and it was all very sad but we saw a house on Friday and it's eh it was a really good house em and so
B	yeah
A	and we eh we spoke to them this morning and put an offer in
B	oh
A	and we started at ninety-eight em thousand which is a scary amount of money
B	right
A	so I said well why not put in an offer for a hundred and two and he came back and said em that em well no that's been rejected I'm afraid
B	oh
A	but the worst part about it is that he's now in a meeting
B	oh no
A	so we can't  we can't  we don't know for another half an hour so
B	ah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	so I'm going to get a phone call very shortly

A	Cos at the moment it's not even go on to the internet internet or anything yet
B	that's brilliant
A	so hopefully we'll have a house
B	oh nice
A	yes
B	I like
A	yeah it's about two minutes from the tram well five minutes from the tram stop so
B	ah lovely
A	it's a lovely yeah
B	have you seen it? Have you been in it and looked around?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	but em we went to see it on em Friday night eh after work
B	yeah
A	and em because it was a lovely weather as well so which I think helps a lot
B	oh right
A	so we need to kind of look at that
B	is it?
A	but eh but quite a big lounge
B	that's nice
A	and there's no separate dining room through kitchen and utility room and eh
B	nice
A	and then upstairs it's got eh three bedrooms
B	ah
A	and eh it's got quite there's not much garden on the front but it goes kinda all down the side and all round the back
B	yeah
A	it's really long down the back
B	ah
A	em so eh so yeah it's it's it's quite eh it's quite good
B	oh
A	particularly exciting
B	that's really good
A	but eh but it's really strange
B	yeah yeah
A	just the thought of spending quite that much money
B	you're growing up
A	I'm growing up
B	that's so exciting
A	I know
B	you'll have to some parties
A	yes
B	yeah
A	so it's it's decorated anyway so we don't need to
B	yes
A	but em yeah but yeah
B	brilliant
A	yeah
B	Cos you can see what it looks like and it's all pretty
A	yeah
B	when when we got our
A	yeah
B	that's well good
A	yeah
B	ooh
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	because he might turn around and say no again
B	in an hour or so
A	I know so
B	I'm nervous now
A	well that was half an hour ago
B	oh no
A	but yeah
B	we'll have to push it by a bit
A	yeah
B	I'm really excited
A	then we have to then we have to move house which is always a trauma
B	yeah
A	so em last it was okay last time
B	eh huh
A	eh just hired a van for a week and
B	yeah
A	kinda did it we were working at the same time eh both of us and it was just a nightmare
B	yeah
A	em I by the Friday I was just I mean the I was so tired cos em
B	yeah
A	we done nothing but pack and move pack and move and pack and move
B	eh huh
A	to em over to
B	oh right
A	so it's a good old drive to the
B	yeah
A	between stops as well
B	yeah
A	it was just yeah it's just not pleasant
B	yeah
A	em but em a time before that we tried to do two days rather than a week
B	oh my gosh
A	and it was just
B	oh
A	so eh so yeah so we're doing it over a a a longer period eh this time
B	yeah
A	at least a week but we'll see
B	eh so when if you find out today that you get it when will you be able to move in if they do?
A	I don't actually know
B	oh okay
A	Cos I mean in theory it will be pretty quick cos we've already got the mortgage in principle sorted em so em it will need to be altered slightly cos it's not for the right amount at the moment
B	yeah
A	but that's not a problem
B	mm hm
A	and em but we've got to get a survey done
B	hmm
A	I reckon probably a month? Six weeks?
A	it could be complete?
B	oh my
A	so eh
B	that is so good
A	yeah
B	do you like packing your boxes?
A	oh tell me about it
A	we still haven't unpacked some of them from the other time
B	yeah
A	and we kind of knew that when we moved in but em we wanted to cos it's next door to some friend's em and it it's a lovely house and I love it and it's been really nice
B	yeah
A	em but they're kinda moving
B	yeah
A	and it will be a shame cos em they've got two kids em
B	aw
A	and em so we've been quite em we we I mean
B	watch them growing up
A	it's a bit of a shame
B	yeah
A	em but em
B	just invite them round
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	so em
B	eh huh
A	so we are gonna end up with probably about a hundred pound a month extra
B	right
A	and eh if we've got that we can afford a car
B	yeah
A	so em we'll just have to wait and see
B	oh it's still here
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	that's so exciting
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	quite a lot of my friends are all moving into houses at the moment
A	it doesn't not scare me
A	I told yeah
B	it's
A	it's very strange
B	wow
A	yeah
B	that is it is so exciting
A	yeah
B	I bet a few years ago on on my course we em we actually filmed in
A	yeah
B	it was freezing
A	yeah
B	it's right near the tram stop
A	yeah
B	it was good
A	yeah nice it's eh it is
B	yeah
A	and em
B	yeah
B	it is lovely round there
A	so
B	it is
A	yeah
A	I just  I just  can't stop grinning
B	yes
A	I'm finding it really tough to actually do
B	yeah
A	some work
B	oh that's so good
A	yeah
B	it's hard
A	yeah I mean it's em well I'll just have to buy we
B	oh right
A	Cos em cos
B	wow brilliant
A	so it's we've got a silly silly amount of books
B	yeah
A	and so we're gonna I just have to buy so many shelves
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	so eh although if em if if if the house goes if he accepts a hundred and five em then we can probably we can do a hundred and ten
B	hmm
A	so it might keep the money from the mortgage to be able to kinda do it up
B	yeah
A	and and and not do it up but buy things for the house furniture and so on
B	oh that's the exciting part ain't it? Making it look like it's yours?
A	yeah
B	that's so good
A	exactly
B	yeah
A	em but it's things to to improve it like shelves and that kind of thing that we've not got that we need
B	ooh
A	so eh don't actually know if he's been taking the carpets with him either which em
B	oh right
A	yeah hopefully he won't
B	right
A	em she's been living in there for some time I suspect they got married recently
B	ah
A	so hopefully he won't want to bother taking carpets and stuff cos it'll
B	yeah
A	well they'll just end up with carpets hanging around
A	excuse me
B	oh is this the call? I thought that was the call then
A	yeah sorry it's not no
B	that's so good
A	yeah
B	he's on edge can't you tell?
B	that is so good
A	yeah
B	oh em
A	so where where are you living at the moment?
B	I live in
A	oh right
B	I'm living with my mum at the moment
A	yeah
B	until em until I can get some funds and then I will be moving out
A	yeah
B	yeah it's hard at the moment
A	yeah
B	and all that stuff's sorted
A	it's which is such a shame because em the payments themselves are fine
B	yeah
A	I mean they're not it's less than rent it's it's fine
B	that's it
A	so so tough
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	my sister lives in Malta and she's moving into a different apartment soon hopefully with her boyfriend and that's what she said
A	yeah
B	but just getting that deposit together is a nightmare
A	yeah
B	both got full time jobs and they still can't manage it
A	yeah
B	it's weird
A	yeah
B	mm hm
A	and em she bought a house for twenty grand
B	yeah
A	equivalent in English money which is just about
B	yeah
A	for which is like
B	oh no
A	but eh but you for for a lot more
B	yeah
A	and she was saying that she loved working over here because em when she takes the money back over it basically doubles its value
B	wow
A	em so em you can't argue with that
B	yeah
A	so eh
B	that's incredible
A	yeah
B	but houses are actually a lot cheaper out there apparently
A	tell me about it
B	yeah
A	em but em but I'm kinda settled here and don't I don't necessarily want to go in the near future
B	mm hm
A	there's no reason to
B	mm hm
A	there's no yeah I've got I mean I've got friends and stuff here
B	definitely
A	it's a bit eh
B	it's a big step
A	it is
B	it's a massive step
A	it is it is
B	yeah of course there is yeah
A	yeah
B	and they've all wanted to end up going back there but
A	yeah
A	she eh that's where she's gone
B	oh nice
A	so she travelled the world for five or so months and then
B	oh yeah
A	and now is eh living and working in Australia
B	that's amazing
A	em
B	yeah
A	em but em like from I can't imagine she'll come back to be honest
B	no majority of people don't want to
A	no
B	why would you when you've got the sunshine and the sea?
A	yeah exactly
B	it's such a good lifestyle out there
A	it is definitely
B	mm hm
A	em and with my family being quite as international as they are
B	yeah
A	em I've always have kinda had that opportunity
B	yeah
A	so eh but no I'd much prefer here rather than
B	yeah and then go travelling there if you wanted to
A	exactly yeah I mean
B	yeah
A	in September I might actually have a member of the family in the same country as me
A	yeah cos my mum's
B	oh brilliant
A	and live in the UK again eh cos she lives in Bahrain
B	yeah
A	and my dad's in Norway
B	yeah
A	and my brother's wherever em working on oilrigs
B	yeah
A	so he's not he's based in the UK but he spends six weeks em away
B	that's amazing
A	at a  at a  time
B	that's amazing
A	there's not many countries he's not been to
B	yeah
A	if they've got oil he's been there
B	yeah
A	so yeah it's eh it's a very international family
B	yeah
B	and have they they chose to go to those countries or is it part of their job that they do that?
A	em well yeah they've chose well
B	yeah
A	em dad is freelance
B	yeah
A	for a on a long term contract
B	oh nice
A	rather than stay in the UK
B	yeah
A	em so eh so yeah
B	oh that's well good that they might be coming home well at least your mum anyway
A	well yeah
B	that's so good
A	I see dad
B	that's another one
A	dad comes home
B	oh nice
A	so but mum it's much more difficult
B	hmm
A	she's not really got a home
B	yeah
A	and mum's bought a couple of houses for her as well
B	mm hm
A	or with us briefly
B	yeah
A	but eh but us
B	ooh that but you must be excited that she's coming back?
A	yeah a little bit
B	I bet
A	erm
B	yeah
A	I mean
B	nice
A	could get we couldn't get all the money together really with all the house stuff
B	yeah
A	which is a shame but it's one of those things
B	yeah
A	em and em but yeah so it would be nice even if she doesn't come home it would be nice
B	yeah
A	em so we can actually go visit more

A	Cos it's been em it was last March not just gone the one before when I saw her last
B	wow
A	yeah
B	do you keep in contact with her like on Skype and?

B	oh
A	so eh so every now and then we don't hear from her for a couple of days
B	yeah
A	so it's but yeah
B	oh that's so good
A	a couple of times a week actually
B	skype's made it a lot easier to do that hasn't it?
A	much much easier
B	yeah
A	which is a real shame
B	yeah
A	but yeah
B	when my sister moved to
A	hmm
B	and I was like go for it
A	yeah
B	she was like I need to tell you something and then she told me about it and I was like eh just go for it eh but my brother wasn't quite so excited about it
B	and he's like the older brother protective of her and he
A	it does make it easy
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	but
A	well I've done a fair bit but yeah it's em
B	yeah
A	it's eh I know I don't I'm still glad I think I'm still glad I live here
B	yeah
A	but yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah but
