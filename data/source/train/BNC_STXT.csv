B	it's cos he cos it's a classed as a
C	do you know you know that you know
B	is it classed as a disability?
C	yeah because you know the really really The Fattest Man in Britain?
B	yeah
C	the one who's an absolute dickhead?
B	mm
C	he got so big he couldn't work and he earned more than someone who has a full time good job earned right and then he had to get a a
D	gastric band
C	gastric band and then he lost loads and loads of weight to obviously because he couldn't eat as much so they took he a lot of his carers off him so he started kicking off about that
B	oh yeah I saw that
C	saying how he deserved this
B	no he was like
C	his money halved
B	yeah cos he was like he wasn't he like I wish I'd died
C	yeah
B	cos they took his care away
C	took his care care allowance off him
B	well I just thought that was because he was so fat he couldn't walk but he had loads of other health issues so he wouldn't have been able to work anyway I didn't realise like if you were obese
C	yeah
B	like that
C	yeah
B	and you can but you can still walk
C	yeah

A	bad for your bones
C	really? stop eating all them foods
B	did you see that erm
B	were on like that were disabled
B	and that suppose they couldn't work here they'd give them an assessment by a doctor send them somewhere like basically say you can do this this and this maybe and then they'd go and assess them in a work placement somewhere
C	mm
B	and then if it was too much for them then they'd be like you can't work there we'll try and find you something else
C	mm
B	there's nothing wrong with your fingers
C	yeah
B	and that and then basically brought around like a house spy cos apparently they used to send these people round
C	yeah
B	to come and assess them in the living situation but what they were actually doing was spying on them to see if they were actually like properly disabled or they were just like basically taking the piss
C	yeah
B	so this woman went in basically said she's fine to work she was proper kicking off and everything refusing she was like I'm not working and then the benefits office were like well a doctor and this woman's cleared you for work you either work or we take all your benefits off you and she was like nearly crying and they were like no they were like you've been cleared you can work you're going to work
C	pisses me off
B	and er but that poor lad in the wheelchair all he wanted to do was work
C	yeah a lot of them do though
B	and that cos he was born with it and he couldn't and then he went and did this thing and he was dead happy cos he was outside and everything like that in this fresh air and that and then they were like it's too much it was too much hard labour on
C	yeah
B	stuff or it was so sad
