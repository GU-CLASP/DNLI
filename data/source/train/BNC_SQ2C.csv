B	special spot
A	yeah
B	it it gets sort of jammed in place and rides alongside it a bit like it's
A	yeah it was really weird like I'd never seen anything
B	yeah I remember like like
A	oh that's weird
B	so the Trojan so the being shared by the two pulls I mean they get pulled into the same orbit
A	yeah
B	um but they don't actually orbit Jupiter they just
A	it's so weird like
B	um
A	so were they trying to do it so that they could like um prove his Einstein's laws on worked on really small scale? Is that the point?
B	no it's nothing to do with Einstein it's uh
A	yeah
B	uh some kind of
A	in lasers?
B	like some kind of high speed lasers or something but
A	I didn't read the whole article I just sort of skimmed it
B	they they don't they get the they get they jammed it in place though using like
A	oh yeah I
B	they had to  they had to  fix
A	I think they do some of that in Lancaster some of that supercooling stuff
B	yeah well they then they blast it with like pulses and stuff and uh
A	yeah
B	they had to
A	not enough water
B	you can see a diagram of the uh um
A	seems there's been loads of like
B	looks like a cross between uh an electron
A	so was that you know that stargazing thing? That Brian Cox thing?
B	oh yeah
A	has that finished now then?
B	I don't know uh
A	D'you think this? Sorry
B	it was pretty good but
A	D'you think this aubergine's alright it looks a bit brown?
B	I don't know what it means if it's brown uh I
A	I'm not sure
B	depends what you're doing it are you gonna  are you gonna  boil it or?
A	I was just gonna chuck it in there for the meal
B	uh just just throw it in the pan and
A	D'you think? Think it'll be alright? Or
B	yeah I mean I had some of it earlier
A	oh right
B	well it did to me I mean
A	I'll just chuck it in
B	it's not
A	I don't know if you're supposed to have it uncooked are you?
A	are you just eating things
B	yeah
A	no I suppose not
B	uh
A	when they're cooked?
B	you know when when they're cooked so you're probably not getting the most out of it if you have it raw
A	yeah
B	but I don't think it's one of those things that's poisonous
A	are you not?
B	I thought it
A	are you not supposed to have them raw?
B	potato?
A	you know crazy  you know crazy  Jim?
B	no
A	you do
B	yeah
A	he eats like potatoes like apples like
B	wow that's really strange
[ANNOTATION]	Crazy Jim was not called that until he came back from uni.	Neutral
A	and onions which is less strange but still a bit strange
B	well onions a lot of people eat raw onions although it's a bit of a
A	but not like an apple not like
B	it's a bit  it's a bit  much to eat a whole onion raw isn't it cos it sort of stings you a bit
A	but not like a banana
B	get get that
A	banana skin
B	your tongue sort of sticks to the um roof of your mouth a bit um
A	yeah
B	and that uh so no I I I thought I read somewhere that a potato is um not not optimal when it's raw but
A	I always
B	just they're just
A	is that right though? D'you ever get like a crisp that sometimes green?
[ANNOTATION]	They know a guy who eats potatoes like a fruit.	Entailment
B	ah well that's something like uh
A	is that something different?
B	uh no I I think that's just one that's escaped through their through the system but um sometimes they have like brown pigmentation in crisps which is um it's bitter or something and they're trying to GM genetically modify
A	really? God like of all the uses for genetically modified?
B	they'll do it they'll do a lot of things I mean
B	but but when you say genetically modified I mean cos partly it's just breeding isn't I mean
A	do they not have to say on the packet?
B	if you've got a bitter batch of
A	yeah
B	well uh yeah for I think it needs need uh turning up maybe but
[ANNOTATION]	They are trying to modify potatoes genetically to get rid of brown spots.	Entailment
A	what do you uh want with this? Like rice or? I have yeah
B	uh probably noodles I think
A	where's the other? Ah where's the other pan?
B	the uh well I can empty that cos that's uh this this one here's um there's not much there's only one round in that well not even a round just one single
[ANNOTATION]	They prefer rice rather than noodles.	Contradiction
A	yeah
B	it's not a problem but uh just put it on here
A	yeah
B	and uh well that's probably a bit much for one but
A	no well
B	well a bit less for two though so
A	no it's not that's normally where it goes up to like up to that line
[ANNOTATION]	They are going to mix kimchi with the noodles.	Neutral
B	think that's quite feels like quite a big one but yeah
A	did you like that soup? I thought it was a bit weird
B	uh this one? I mean yeah well I don't
A	dunno
B	sort of it's sort chicken and uh
A	coriander it was cos it was
B	yeah that's that's fine I I like it
A	maybe we'll use that butternut squash then for the soup next week?
B	we didn't put an extra stock in there cos
A	oh no
B	an extra
A	yeah
B	oh yeah well
A	but um
B	um oh you've  oh you've  put an order in for from Sainsbury's?
A	yeah
B	are the Sainsbury's about to deliverer a haggis or? What d'you want in this one then?
A	uh can you put some water in him for the noodles?
B	is this thing turned up?
A	yeah I dunno
B	I would say it certainly takes longer to
A	I said happy birthday to uh Claire on Facebook today
B	oh right
A	you'll have to maybe
B	um
A	I know you don't check it very often
B	right
A	no no I mean
B	oh was it? Um
A	it's
B	I don't know there's there's a few people round I know aren't there?
A	there's
B	yeah
A	Monday I think
B	there's the what the pan? What?
A	no like the little box
B	I like the box yeah that's good
A	I have to transfer them out of there
B	yeah you got a lot of uh recipes in it and
A	one of the problems is like I I get them sometimes I just get them off the internet and then make then and then forget where I've got them from so
B	right
A	I think they're good for like if you run out of ideas so like I just tend to cook the same things like all all
B	yeah
A	I think I've cut too many carrots
B	uh
A	oh yeah anyway I was gonna say about that Brian Cox thing?
B	oh yeah yeah
A	like the funniest thing about that I thought was like when they were like Here we are live in Devon and we're gonna turn all the lights off
B	um
A	it wouldn't have mattered if all the lights had been on
B	oh yeah uh
A	it's quite clear here though the skies and I I think they're quite good
B	they're alright
A	D'you remember in
B	um which time?
A	when we were when we went on that walk and through the forest and that
B	yeah um
A	ooh ooh turn that off
B	it is good to be able to see that uh
A	na
B	the
A	uh
B	yeah
A	Orion's Belt and that's about it
B	I can't
A	those ones what's that one that's like a square that's a famous one as well
B	is that the Pegasus that's a big square?
A	yeah I think so
B	oh yeah to measure how
A	there's like a light pollution measurement thing
B	yeah wasn't there that that programme was good cos uh they sort of did a lot of uh
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	oh right
B	yeah and that that didn't
A	like This is the human body like Robert Winston like pointing to an arm going This is an arm like
B	yeah
A	it's just a bit oh yawn yawn sort of thing
B	yeah well it was going it was going into quite a lot of detail but they had  they had  uh Brian Cox
A	I bet like
B	real
A	you know like real inverted commas physicists
B	probably some of them are I mean like
A	you know when he's just like look at the stars like
B	they might think he's not as good
A	scientists?
B	to become um cosmologists
A	hey where's the honey? Have you seen it? Where? In the back at the top or?
B	no at the back
A	oh
B	behind that cabbage
A	sorry
B	but so I don't really know
A	oh that's so hard though
B	some of the stuff you don't know how true it is and um
A	that's the thing with anything
B	well I don't know
A	mhm
B	I mean to what extent is it backed up by uh findings
A	yeah
B	and everything
A	yeah
B	uh theories and um rules that they've got so
A	I think it's quite
A	big physics yeah
B	so that uh
A	yeah
B	um but at the moment they they don't know
A	well I suppose he's promoting it
B	it's like the big  the big  bang the big big bang theory it's a bit like uh um that's sort of really really theoretical actually a lot of the stuff they talk about isn't it?
A	well it's quite good though I suppose for making it for popularizing it
B	like yeah
B	the all the characters are funny I mean that's it's just funny and people don't watch that really for
B	oh d'you mean uh the big bang or the
A	hm?
B	do d'you mean Big Bang Theory or d'you mean uh
A	what d'you mean?
B	Cox's programme
A	oh well I was talking about big
B	big Bang
A	oh no science I suppose
B	sort of
A	and being a geek like
B	yeah
A	but that really came in though didn't it like? Like that whole um
B	who's these cool kids? What? Glasses?
A	like last year
B	bit sort of square glasses?
A	you know they're really black like black rimmed thick ones
B	well my dad's got some
A	no not not not not exactly like that
B	big ones like the
A	those are like Miami Vice glasses
B	um or Ben Elton from the eighties
A	Deirdre Barlows
B	you know there's his rolled up  rolled up  jacket
A	oh yeah
B	um uh and uh big Deirdre Barlow glasses and
A	Deirdre Barlow
B	yeah does she still have the same?
A	Ken Barlow is
B	he doesn't need to have a
B	it's just Ken Barlow with a signature across his photograph
A	signed photo?
B	you know he doesn't  he doesn't  really
A	Coronation Street?
B	that probably wouldn't happen within his sort of working uh working life I would have thought
A	did? I've told you haven't I that me
B	Cos until all the viewers sort of gradually begin to die out I don't think there'll be any sign of uh the end of Coronation Street but
A	I've told you haven't I like that that the uh that me nana used to have a picture of like all of her grandchildren and the cast of Coronation Street?
B	signed?
A	like not not one picture
A	she's bonkers
B	so she preferred
A	she preferred Corrie and Emmerdale
B	neighbours? Well older people don't normally like that sort of thing do they?
A	no
B	I mean
A	I mean she did like Big Brother and that
B	yeah I mean that could be filthy couldn't it I mean in terms of the language and
A	yeah
B	I mean it's so sort of like it's sort of breaking a lot of conventions in in decency you know decency's just gone hasn't it sort of on on on that I mean
A	yeah
B	that was uh
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A mentioned the X-Factor show.	Contradiction
A	but anyway I was saying so them glasses you know the you know which ones I mean? The really black ones?
B	uh National Health glasses you said
A	yeah
B	is that just for? Amongst um
A	I dunno like cool people
B	is it  is it  that
A	oh yeah
B	is his name um Richard or Chris or something?
[ANNOTATION]	The National Health glasses are yellow.	Contradiction
A	yeah yeah Richard
B	so I think he wears a pair of thick-rimmed uh glasses black glasses
A	he does yeah
B	so um he might've helped that's it
A	and also
B	so it's become more popular to be geeky but it's also becoming more popular to be a criminal I think as well so there's this well there's always a
[ANNOTATION]	The name of the guy who wears black glasses is Richard.	Entailment
A	well
B	you know the it's not  it's not  sort of
A	and
B	yeah I think it's
A	loads of them in Primark
B	which which um? Were?
A	I remember like sitting on Facebook like our Amy had written something like No you're not cool you're just a slag in a rubbish jumper
B	that's the the sort of um
A	yeah like looking really distressed and like Hey man this is from a charity shop
[ANNOTATION]	Primark was founded in 1900.	Neutral
B	fair enough
A	there's
B	although I prefer jumpers to sort of some of the other things that you know local people wear
A	what d'you mean?
B	more sort of
A	tracksuits and that?
B	well them sorts of
A	ah I love them
[ANNOTATION]	People prefer jumpers because it's usually cold in the area.	Neutral
B	no
A	maybe
B	I
A	Elizabeth Duke uh the jewellery range
B	yeah I think you've mentioned that
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B has probably heard of Elizabeth Duke.	Entailment
A	and like
B	better better to stick with the jumper I think
A	ay?
B	better to stick with the jumper
B	um
A	I never make enough sauce
B	they they have much uh bling then?
A	oh loads
A	thank you
B	that programme about Mexico that I watched uh
A	which one?
B	um
A	ah the one about the dead?
B	some aspect of Mexican culture where they they have a festival of the dead or something like that
A	yeah
B	are they called graven images or something um uh?
A	I don't know
B	various uh  various uh  little um
A	ah I know what you mean that's I can't remember the word
B	little uh idol
A	oh it's on the tip of me tongue
B	so there's a bit of a similarity with that I think
A	yeah like Jesus's face made out of jewels though like how stupid?
B	they uh
A	I can get you one for Christmas if you want one you know? From the Vatican maybe aye
B	mm
A	they have all that kind of stuff there
B	have you ever found the one of those uh you know the face of the Virgin Mary in a  in a in a  carrot or something like?
A	not not as yet
B	maybe you weren't looking hard enough or
A	I know I'll have to keep me eyes peeled
A	what's that thing called though that's that's the name for it when you see faces in things?
B	oh yeah um I've forgotten what that's called
A	where did I read that?
B	I told you about it
A	oh right
B	uh
A	excuse me
B	which is called uh para something
A	about
B	yeah that's um
A	I don't believe in any of that sort of supernatural stuff
B	so there was yeah they were talking about uh photos and and where you see yeah uh they had say maybe ten different uh effects that people mistake for
A	yeah
B	ghosts or some other kind of um
A	I remember
B	supernatural uh being and uh there were different tricks and they include things like uh
A	mm
B	the other one is if you got water on the lens it can create little little spots which can shine and look like uh a
A	they're supposed to be orbs of energy
B	orbs of energy or UFOs or something
A	oh me mam believes in all that kind of bollocks like
B	also saw a programme around the same time about uh
A	oh when he was
B	the where they did the little little thing about UFOs
A	oh cos they
B	and um sort of uh they obviously Professor Brian Cox is a bit sceptical about UFOs
A	oh right of course
B	uh the the existence I mean
A	D'you want any green beans?
B	I think if you're intelligent enough to get to Earth
A	yeah
B	then you'd be intelligent enough not to reveal yourself in a clumsy sort of wabbling uh nineteen fifties looking black and white saucer
A	should buy more
B	uh what?
A	I've had like an annoying sort of thing all day like
B	um
A	and then you've gotta go like that?
B	oh you mean phlegm
A	lovely
B	no I didn't know that uh
A	maybe it was after that like choking fit that I had
B	A choking fit
A	I was like standing over the uh corridor
B	yeah
A	I was like The Heimlich
A	I know
B	the the chicken soup
A	choked on soup
B	and then tested it and then nearly killed yourself with the soup
A	doctor Heimlich
B	uh
A	and he's like trying to invent something and he's like Ah I will invent a manoeuvre
A	D'you remember?
B	well he's just  he's just  sitting in his studio artist's studio?
A	no he's a doctor doctor Heimlich
B	yeah
A	he was trying to invent something um like he and he's had a lot of money but
B	to get  to get  oh yeah to get uh fame?
A	yeah
B	just uh
B	did you say that it's quite brutal the Heimlich and that you can end up with a broken rib?
A	oh yeah but I think it doesn't matter
B	suppose so yeah
A	you don't
B	yeah
A	with children you you just like dangle them upside down
A	actually if they're little enough you're supposed to
B	so maybe that would work if it was a small person as well
A	you're supposed to hold them by the legs with one hand and then like wallop them on the back with the other hand
B	right
A	like if they're a baby
B	it's the same procedure as if you'd trapped something inside an inanimate which you could pick up
A	this is very very true
B	so
B	is there not?
A	well it does work eventually but hitting it on  hitting it on  a side to side motion as opposed to an up and down motion is much more effective
B	yeah you just whack it
A	oh yeah
B	uh
A	some sort of suction surely
B	it's not
A	oh right
B	or
A	ooh I've got a bit of a headache
B	it's really sticky
A	yeah I've just really cooked it
B	so d'you wanna mix the
A	yeah
B	noodles in with the vegetables?
A	yeah
B	need that
A	no I I meant like for the dishes not for like draining these noodles
B	oh yeah yeah the uh a drainer yeah
A	oh I've made too many haven't I?
B	um
A	can leave some for tomorrow
B	if if they make it through to tomorrow yeah
B	so this is uh you got what uh honey and soy?
A	mm
B	mix in sauce there
A	bit of lemon juice
B	should put put a bit of uh bit of water in with that or?
A	if you want to there's some juice in the fist
B	right
A	so
A	I'm aware of making it too runny though cos that's the
B	no I don't think that would happen with the uh
A	noodles?
B	with this one cos think there's a lot of noodles so like they'd absorb it
A	yeah
B	un and it's a
A	it is a bit of a habit of mine though
B	well no I think
A	no
B	sort of a broth
A	ah it's not supposed to be though
B	but in this case think the pan's hot so it's gonna evaporate
A	mm
B	it's
A	I know it was good
B	um
A	tonight it's the thingy bob challenge where they cook like um
B	that was
A	yeah
B	I think they're gonna replace like BBC News with uh like BBC Food News or something
A	aha I think that would be
B	um
A	they're gonna do like a mass cooking challenge tonight where they've gotta cook for like soldiers or like a group of whoever like a big group of people anyway
B	um
A	maybe I'm just
B	ah fork and spoon
A	okay
A	I don't wanna use a fork and spoon
B	yeah if you  if you  use a fork and spoon you're sort of putting a sort of clasp the the uh the spoon and the fork together
B	uh
A	no I'm not very good at it
B	um
A	chop
B	chopstick and then sort of grab the uh item with the fork and spoon
A	ah
B	uh
A	there's two fish
B	yep yep uh thanks for making it
A	no probs d'you wanna?
