C	it's all that stuff
B	now I'm aged seven and that says aged six
A	what does? what says aged six?
B	my passport
A	oh does it?
B	yeah it was the summer time we went to Spain
A	does it say your age or does it say your date of birth?
B	I think it's date of birth
A	yes it says your date of birth my love
C	and also
A	as well
B	yeah because he had a passport
A	I probably oh no I renewed mine two years ago but for a while I hadn't I didn't have a passport for about
C	what's a valid?
A	one is one that's current that you can use so mine had become out of date because we hadn't been anywhere but it didn't matter because I wasn't going anywhere on holiday however passports are very important for jobs and things because they are our way of proving who you are it's probably well they either
C	a lot
[ANNOTATION]	The passports have no expiration date.	Contradiction
A	for holiday purposes but I
C	hundreds of years
A	not hundreds of years
A	for about eleven years
C	woah one hundred and eleven wait one hundred and ten
A	a hundred and
C	one one one
B	you're old
[ANNOTATION]	Not all countries require a passport to enter.	Neutral
A	do you want anything else to eat for for your breakfast? some apple?
B	is it eleven thousand years old?
C	no thank you
B	is it eleven thousand years old?
A	what how old I am?
C	no firstly I would like to eat
B	no
A	well if you could eat something that was just a number I would be very impressed
C	just a number
A	mm
C	I mean is it that years old?
A	you know that Chinese people bury their eggs and make them rotten and they eat them
C	why?
A	it's a delicacy so they eat like a hundred-year-old eggs they do I don't think I'd like it
C	I've eaten the Wok and Grill scrambled eggs is that a hundred years old?
B	no because that
[ANNOTATION]	The scrambled eggs in Wok and Grill are made of normal eggs.	Entailment
A	that was freshly done that day
B	because the Wok and Grill don't do that because they know everyone is not Chinese so if we do that then they might not come to our place so let's do it today
[ANNOTATION]	It is the Australian who bury the eggs for 100 years.	Contradiction
A	mm
B	not a hundred years ago because I'm not sure the Wok and Grill was here one hundred years ago
A	I don't think it was
C	hopefully they haven't buried any eggs in case
A	I don't know I don't know if modern Chinese people still do it
A	I could imagine that the egg would not taste very nice at all what are you doing?
C	she's not doing anything
[ANNOTATION]	It is likely that currently people in China don't really bury eggs.	Entailment
A	mm I don't believe that for one moment
A	right if you've finished can you go and could you put your plates in the dishwasher please? and go and brush your teeth
A	thank you very much
