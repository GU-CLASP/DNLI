A	ha ha we won't run out
B	okay
B	has everybody got what they need?
C	yeah
A	yes yeah
C	erm

A	erm I'm alright for the minute I'll I'll stick with water for the minute
B	you'd like tea?
A	um I I'm alright for the minute thanks I'll I'll just have water
C	maybe I'm slightly counter-intuitive
A	um
C	okay
A	did you? Or did you want?
C	I don't mind trying one of those
A	okay cool
C	I'm gonna start with a wrap
A	and see how hungry you are after that
C	mm
C	yeah I know then I thought actually I have no idea how to do that
A	yeah
C	do you wanna try?
A	no
C	the only thing that comes to mind is the inappropriate song from Friends
A	ha
C	exactly
A	mm
C	sorry?
A	you know a bit of Eminem?
C	who?
A	Don't you?
C	no
C	I actually didn't understand a word of that
A	it's about Moby who is
C	who's this chap?
A	eminem
C	oh I was thinking Moby but actually yes
A	oh yeah
C	like a robot?
A	ha
C	well that was truly awful
A	what was? The robot?
C	computerised human  computerised human  electronic secret enforcer
A	hm
C	erm
A	or it'd be chess
C	ego boosting
A	yeah
C	it's interesting in Friends though because they mock cos it's quite clever a lot of it but they but but they seem to mock cos well they don't mock Ross for being intelligent necessarily
A	yeah
C	exactly
A	so I guess yeah that it's not intelligent it's the fact that he chose to use that in a particular way
C	yeah
A	I mean it is quite funny being a palaeontologist like that is moderately reasonable
C	nice friends
A	pardon? Yeah exactly yeah
C	in all fairness he is a pain in the arse
A	yeah
C	as in you should realise that you don't
A	yeah
C	no no they're interested in that but when he's actually saying what was in it
A	mm
C	yes exactly
C	erm
B	nobody else wants tea er at the moment?
A	no thank you
C	no thanks
A	would you like some cornflakes?
C	not currently
A	no no I mean
C	well there a bit tasteless actually I think I remember something and of course it was here that I learn to mix cereal so I have that crunchy stuff on top of cornflakes
A	oh nice
C	it's exciting
A	it's very
C	living it large
A	I was going to say yeah
C	loving it loving it
A	but um
C	Don't know why that came into my head
A	what was I going to say? Um
C	I feel slightly weird today
A	yea
C	mm
A	bizarre hot day
C	erm
B	oh dear
A	you alright?
B	it's alright
A	oh right
C	see making tea is dangerous
A	yeah
C	that's why I don't have tea
A	what cos of the dangers?
C	yes
A	except when you pour salt
C	yeah
A	yeah no you're not allowed to
C	someone just nicked my hand with like a wire cutter
A	yeah
C	I don't mind that this happened
A	yeah
C	if I was self-harming
A	yeah
C	then maybe that's a separate issue but
A	if you're not bothered yeah
C	yeah
A	okay
C	right um
A	oh
C	brilliant
A	yes er
C	um tomatoes olives or anchovies? Oh not anchovies
A	they're
B	I'd be a bit careful
C	mm
C	oh
A	hmm hmm
C	seriously it's like a structural element to the sandwich
A	nice
C	mm
A	mm
C	so we were walking through
A	um
C	yeah it would have been last Friday
A	okay
C	and we were meaning to go to this erm fish
B	A
C	an Iranian restaurant
B	mm mm
C	which was different
A	it was really good but one of those things you never expect to end up doing
C	mm
A	but it was  it was  nice
B	and what did you have there?
A	um
C	um
A	we had er for starter it was kind of um bread and dips and things like that and then we had two they were both chicken dishes I think
C	mm
A	um but it's not like Indian food
C	mm
A	and it was like served with rice
C	mm
A	hmm
C	which was bizarre
C	I think I might have one of these
A	yeah
C	iced gold in fact
B	oh
C	it's really cool
A	mm
C	hmm
A	one of those or ham
C	okay
A	do you want another roast chicken one or?
C	um pick choose whatever you want I'll go with the flow
A	wouldn't mind a ham one
C	go for it
C	mm cos what we're doing at the moment is essentially it's designing what I can only describe as a crossbow
C	um
C	hmm
C	it's not actually a cross bow
A	I know but
C	it's sort of about this big
A	oh okay quite big then
C	mm
B	and what part do you take playing it?
C	target
A	I was gonna say I'm not involved
C	mm
A	yeah
C	I'm quite scared that we're doing it
C	Cos it's gonna take in total erm about fifty kilos of force to cock this
A	mm
C	mm
A	I'll just sit on the end of it for you
C	it wouldn't exactly work
A	that'd be a lot of effort
C	mm
A	so there's ham salmon chicken
C	I think I might have a second chicken
A	yeah it's fine
C	mm
A	mm
B	pardon?
A	my sister's going to come down and do some work experience in my office next week
B	right
A	so she's coming to stay with us which will be it'll be nice
C	she's she's arriving tomorrow
B	is she older or younger?
A	younger
C	I take it you're going to be bossing her around
A	ha ha
C	mm
B	oh as a pupil or teaching?
C	mm
B	oh?
A	she's um as an undergraduate yeah
B	oh
A	she's um yeah so and she's kind of thinking about what she wants to do afterwards so she's gonna come down have a look have a go at publishing and she what she thinks see if she thinks it's a
B	what do you think you want to do?
A	what does she think she wants to do?
B	what?
A	what does she think she wants to do yeah?
B	mm
A	um
C	she's a little bit what you call work shy
C	um
A	but she she might find that she really likes publishing
C	if there's a lot of tea and cake I suspect she'll love it
A	mm mm
C	oh dear
A	huh huh
C	could we not just employ her in the house as a domestic servant?
A	no
C	mm mm
B	have you
C	no actually
B	oh
C	um
B	yeah I didn't know it was Mother's Day
C	ah
A	last night
C	the last
A	she was a bit cross
C	A bit miffed I think would be a better description
A	mm
C	erm so erm
C	okay it's six erm
A	mm
C	so we were cos last Sunday we went er a couple of friends we went walking in Derbyshire
B	ah we've done that many times
A	mm
C	well there's a old railway line that runs between Buxton and
A	Bakewell
C	Bakewell
A	mm
C	um but um
C	yeah it was terrifying erm
B	I used to know all that part of the world very well
A	mm
C	Cos you grew up in
B	yeah
A	mm
C	we found this place called um
A	oh I can't remember
C	yeah it's like someone built a town on the bottom of a canyon
A	mm
C	something
B	pardon?
C	something it was
A	yeah
C	it'll be on the road atlas
A	mm
C	it was bizarre
A	mm
C	and it had a huge um abandoned what presumably was a cotton mill
A	mm mill yeah mill yeah
C	um which sort of Victorian hang over which had been turned into a big shopping market
A	mm
C	erm
A	one salmon and one chicken wrap
C	I told you we'd need this many
A	mm mm
C	not hugely
A	mhm
C	erm
B	pardon?
C	would you like another sandwich?
B	er no thank you
A	mm
B	I've I've got some sweet er if you want
C	oh we've bought some as well
A	mm
C	we've bought that as well
B	oh
C	very well prepared
A	we've got some fruit salad for later
C	I'm not sure I actually want to have a full one
A	mm
C	I think we did too
A	mm
C	I'm glad you agree
A	yes
C	sure?
A	yes
C	oh no go ahead
A	no that's that's fine
C	no go on go on go on
A	ah
C	go on go on go on
A	ha ha you're turning into Mrs Doyle
C	go on Mrs Doyle
A	hm hm
C	erm
A	ah
C	and so that was quite erm entertaining last weekend
A	mm
C	erm and then set off sort of earlyish on Sunday
A	but it was good
C	mm
A	it was nice to see somewhere new and you know go somewhere somewhere different
B	mm
C	mm
B	it's near what?
C	near
B	yeah what did you say?
C	er
B	no I don't know
C	erm
A	mm
C	and um they've just got a new one though just finished converting
B	mm
A	we're looking forward to that
C	yeah
A	so we need to  need to  book that
C	if it's not raining
A	it probably will be raining but
C	so you're essentially sitting in a bath outside with an umbrella
B	ha
C	which I'm keen for
A	I suppose if you're already wet then
C	exactly how much wetter can you get?
A	yeah
C	so that's going to be um yeah hopefully quite relaxing cos we haven't had any leave yet this year
A	yeah
C	um
A	mm
C	erm ooh and I did I think I told you about my Channel swimming plans
B	no
C	in that case I this the goal for this summer was to do a Channel swim
C	which is a bit of an issue
A	rather than insane
B	it's very cold the Channel
C	well it's warmer than pretty much anywhere else around here
B	really?
C	well it's warmer than the North Sea
B	no no no the Channel is supposed to be very cold
C	oh great
B	oh yes
A	pretty cold
C	um
B	well I think it's always running the water isn't it through the Channel
C	oh okay
B	one way or the other that keeps it cold
A	oh right
C	yeah and it also slows you down because you sort of have to swim diagonally
B	mm
C	um as if you would if you were in a boat um
B	Good gracious
C	erm and you also have to pay the coastguard five hundred pounds to stop cargo ships hitting you
A	yeah
B	yes
A	it's just it turns out to be really expensive
B	mm
A	you've gotta
C	well you shouldn't
A	you shouldn't yeah
C	I mean er it's generally like
B	but don't they have occasions when it it's sort of a mass swim the Channel
C	no
B	they used to have
C	really?
B	mm
A	ah
C	because only how many of those people died? Because there was only about sort of it's less than a thousand people who have ever done it in history
B	oh no I don't think so
C	well there's a record kept like the first
B	in in in my youth it was the best sort of popular swim
A	maybe it wasn't officially registered
C	maybe it was a
A	maybe they just used to get in a do it
B	oh yes
C	because the first person that did it
B	I don't know if it was a Captain
C	was it Captain something?
B	pardon?
C	it was captain in the Army
B	mm
A	was it?
C	erm
A	mm
C	erm
B	really?
C	erm
B	that there is very cold
C	I know
B	yes I was swimming in
A	ah
C	really?

C	and raisins
B	the marshmallow please
C	no it er they're mixed
B	oh

A	probably a bit sticky
C	it might be a bit of an effort
[ANNOTATION]	The marshmallows are covered in caramel	Contradiction
A	can we have some  can we have some  bowls just for the fruit
C	oh yes indeed
A	er where?

B	I'm ashamed of myself I don't know the Lake District like the back of my hand
C	see I don't know it at all

C	erm It's quite good cos it tells you your blood group and stuff
C	well
A	if it means you keep coming back then you know they can't complain too much
C	well it doesn't brilliantly thrill me but it's like my way of making it you know sort of not unpleasant so

A	hmm mm
C	hmm
B	do you want some milk on that?
A	I'm fine thank you
C	no
C	mm mm
A	melon
C	mm mm?
A	the melon's not right
C	oh
A	the two foods that I really don't like
C	unless caviar or melon
A	unless it's caviar
C	you'd be surprised if you were in a situation in which you found it's a problem
A	having said that I would use caviar but yeah melon is just an issue
B	would you like some ice cream?
A	no no I'm fine thank you
C	I thought you were gonna say caviar then
B	well it's the best ice cream
C	hmm
C	right so last night we all went out for a Mother's Day meal essentially
A	mm
C	um and had a very good time
C	mm mm
B	I think er Norway is as good as anywhere
A	oh
C	you can get the ferry
A	you can get the ferry over
C	now when you went did you take your own car or?
B	yes
A	mm mm yeah
C	mm
B	Newcastle to well there's two
C	Bergen isn't it?
A	mm
B	sometimes to Bergen
A	oh okay
B	and then you could stay on it and go up to Bergen
C	Oslo?
B	no Oslo's in a different country isn't it
C	I'm fairly sure Oslo is the capital of
A	was it oh oh Oslo's the capital I think
C	it's like round the corner
B	yes mm
C	I don't think it's in Sweden though
A	mm
C	um
A	yeah
C	and it's definitely a country sorry capital
A	yeah
C	mm
B	I've probably got some books on Norway
C	mm
A	mm
C	mm
B	um
C	the North Pole?
C	actually you can't do that by land from there can you
A	can you?
C	er well er Top Gear drove there
A	oh
B	I I've been there about three or four times
C	the North Pole or Norway?
B	Norway
C	right
A	mm
B	with a car and then motored across Sweden and into Norway
A	lovely
C	that sounds awfully fun
C	of course nowadays which you probably couldn't at the time you could go via Russia
B	mm
C	mm mm
A	mm
C	mm
A	so we start in get the ferry to
C	mm
A	drive to Poland
C	that'd be really cool do a driving circuit
A	wow
C	so you drive down to the Channel
A	mm
C	drive through France Belgium Germany Poland Russia Finland Sweden Norway
B	well I I have done that personally
A	mm
B	driven along the coast to the Baltic states
C	mm mm
B	got a ferry from the Baltic states to Sweden and through Sweden into Norway
A	wow
C	but you missed Finland
B	um
C	okay cool
A	wow
C	mm
B	mm
C	well in Germany they don't have um speed restrictions
A	ha ha you can speed through that bit
C	it'll be much quicker
B	the roads aren't very good for speeding in Norway
B	well though I expect it's different now
C	well
A	mm
C	well that's probably still like Scotland now
B	mm
C	oh I'm pleased he's remembered that I don't take tea
A	yeah
C	sorry?
A	he's really with it
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	I really want to do a tour
A	mm
C	across go down through Belgium Germany and through Switzerland into North Italy
A	mm mm
C	and then come back via France
A	you mentioned that before
C	expensive
A	mm
C	but er
A	all the fuel
C	not that much of a big deal but it would arguably yeah be cheaper to fly than pay for petrol
A	mm mm
C	which is slightly alarming
A	yeah
C	no erm
A	hmm hmm hmm
C	and landing might be a bit fun but
C	it's all mostly on auto pilot nowadays anyway
A	wasn't specifically meaning you flying but yes
C	well you know on Ryanair you actually have to provide your own pilot don't you?
C	mm
A	twenty pounds return
C	what I'd do is I'd just put on all my clothes
A	well
B	those two are Norway
B	but er
A	oh brilliant
C	it does look rather good doesn't it
A	mountains
C	it has to be said the fashion for glasses at that time wasn't in a good point
B	mm
B	that's Norway
A	ooh
C	Glacier
A	fun slash terror
C	well there's nothing to hit
A	mm
C	spider of some description
B	I think most of these are Norway but that can't tell where
A	ah
B	and that was  that was that was  my car the red one
C	mm
A	very nice
C	I remember that car
B	pardon?
C	I remember being in that car
B	mm oh
C	didn't have any head restraints in the back
A	oh
C	no
A	right
C	well that that would have been one of the first cars to have rear seatbelts
A	hmm
C	that's a
B	that's
C	that's a Volvo two forty isn't it
B	mm
A	oh
C	I think that's one of the best ones
A	mm mm
B	yes they're all Norway
C	actually if you
A	yeah sure
C	I'll just gonna
A	uh-huh what do you want me to do?
C	I don't know that one looks somewhere that's more like Scotland
A	mm
B	you can still go from er go from erm Newcastle
A	huh look
C	yes
A	oh
A	look what it says on the back
C	galloway?
A	galloway
C	I thought that was Scotland
A	I've bene to Gatehouse of Fleet
C	I think it's almost in Scotland
A	right
C	no that's not that's Norway
B	there's no many parts of the world I haven't been to and I think Norway is the best of holiday myself
A	mm
C	bit expensive though
B	yes it always was
A	mm right
B	but mind you you don't spend much money except on petrol
A	okay
B	and I forget what price the petrol was
C	well nowadays that costs a fortune
A	yeah
C	look road ends
A	ha ha crazy golf
C	crazy golf
B	just can't read
A	mm
B	whatever that is
C	I think country highway is a bit of a generous description
A	looks like a track
B	I expect the well the roads will have improved since then
C	mm
A	yeah true
C	but erm yes do you want to describe that time we played mini golf at that zoo
A	oh yeah so we we were at the sort of wildlife park and we decided to have a game of crazy golf
B	yes
A	and Peter didn't like this very much
C	that's not exactly what happened
A	that's my memory of it
C	but ever since then we had a rule where we can't play crazy golf
A	huh huh
B	that's erm
C	yeah
B	yes it is Geiranger
A	ah
B	but I think we went three years in succession I think
C	oh okay
A	oh cool look the back of the boat
B	and we went  we went  North twice and South once
C	it's nineteen eighty-five
A	mm
C	wow
B	that's in Norway yes
C	you don't look that cold
A	hmm mm mm
C	oh look at the houses
A	oh they're lovely aren't they
C	so grand and Baltic
A	huh yeah
C	burger
A	oh look a Burger
C	wow
A	mm
C	that's a big ship
B	what one?
C	that one
A	nice Volvos
C	yep
B	mm
A	oh yes
B	this I that this is um Oslo isn't it? I think
C	ahh
B	oh yes I think it's very nice Norway you'll like it
A	hmm
C	mm
B	oh right
C	the subtle advantage to that is I speak some French
A	where as you don't speak any Norwegian
B	well in in Norway everybody speaks English
A	mm
C	that's no fun
C	I had this problem in Belgium
A	yeah you tried really hard to get someone to talk French to you and everyone just spoke in English
C	exactly
A	I love the guy who said in English 'Shall we just speak in English?'
C	that's really annoying
A	yeah
A	but yeah um I there's a singer I like who's from Bergen
C	that's obscure
A	it's very obscure
C	look at ABBA?
A	well exactly yeah I mean that's how you sell your music to a an audience because otherwise you it's a very limited market for it
C	mm
A	what because they don't need to worry about it yeah
C	yeah
A	yeah
B	mm
C	imagine the Spice Girls doing translation
A	no huh
C	erm wow
A	impressive
C	just a bit yeah
A	mm it is yeah
C	possibly for good reason
A	mm
C	is that a Greggs?
A	yeah it does say Greggs
C	oh I like that house
A	hmm mm would you?
