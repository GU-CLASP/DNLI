B	why didn't you meet them in town?
A	cos they've been quite busy they met
B	who's
B	why

A	no it's not on a tube stop

B	that's what I just said
A	yeah it wasn't a tube though it was the overground
B	that's not a tube but I thought it was on the tube
A	so they'd have to get to the overland basically which means where's the nearest place to catch the overland from here?
B	no fucking idea
A	would that be Camden? Camden road or something?
B	no there'd be a better way than that
A	yeah there would that's the only way I know
B	yeah that's a lot of travelling
A	yeah
B	did you give them instructions how to find this place?
A	well I've said go you can't go wrong so long as you get on the right train
B	oh

A	ah
B	what?
A	creamy garlic portobello mushroom on sourdough
B	yeah I said that
A	well I'm saying it now mains which is the veggie?
B	is that what you'd have is it?
A	there's hardly any vegetarian options
B	there's only that pearl barley
A	yeah that's a bit weedy really I think we should probably go for pizza you said that too didn't you?
B	do they want to eat?
A	yes
B	or they've probably never been to a Wimpy
A	yeah all-day breakfast's probably still going
B	or would they like the Italian Eritrean
A	it probably would that's very vegetarian isn't it?
B	yeah
A	is that the one with the dips?
B	or pizza
A	more comfortable in the
B	they have Eritrean beer?
A	do they? is it nice beer?
B	I tried every single one

A	oh it would be nice to go to the
B	what darling?
A	it would be nice to go to the
B	oh they're playing Scrabble
A	there's a Scrabble
B	oh let's shall I teach you how to play mancala?
A	yeah okay oh that's probably ours did we give that away?
B	no well
A	is this a game that uses your brain?
B	yeah but I've never quite worked out how
A	is it it's er it's a bit boring otherwise if it doesn't
B	okay so let me try and just think how you play it you pick up any one you like
A	and what's the object of the game?
B	to have most things in here
A	to have all these things in one of these holes?
B	yeah we'll just play it and then you'll pick it up
A	in there
B	just help me put four in each again
A	do I have to start in any particular place?
B	going
A	can you work that out or is that
B	well yeah cos it's
A	is it more random than that?
B	it's easy now cos you know there's four and that's one two three four and you'd get another go later on when there's loads it's difficult to work out
A	I'll do that then
B	so one
A	it's pretty boring
B	well how do you know? you've only gone once
B	your go
A	er where do I pick up from now?
B	anywhere on your side of the board
A	anywhere I want?
B	yeah
A	it isn't going in order then?
B	no you can do what you want
A	just to get as many stuck in here as you can
B	and how do you how do you get them in there again?
A	every time you go past it you drop one off in there
B	also I should point out when you're finished you get every all the ones that a other person has left that's important to remember all so I can do the same as you look
A	can I pick up one of these?
B	yeah
A	do what you want
[ANNOTATION]	A has never worked out before	Contradiction
B	any of these?
A	oh then I wouldn't go very far there either what was that opposite thing again?
B	put it into one if I were to end up with one there I'd capture your one opposite
A	can't I oh
B	it won't become clear until you know how it works so we'll just rush through this first
A	so far it's very boring
A	er? I've got those
B	no but if you'd gone one you would have won all this
A	I have
B	no no the last one the last that you put down
A	oh
B	fills an empty one and you you capture
[ANNOTATION]	A is winning the game	Neutral
A	the last one you put there?
B	you capture everything on this side
A	oh
B	too late
A	this is stupid
B	stupid
A	I'm bored
B	oh yeah
[ANNOTATION]	A is losing the game	Neutral
A	so you like playing this game?
A	and
B	losing to
[ANNOTATION]	A doesn't think the game is boring	Contradiction
A	oh I don't know was that in there?
B	no it wasn't
A	why?
B	otherwise your next go you'll go one two and capture the rest
A	is it Greek?
B	er I think it's more
A	how did you find out about this game?
B	you see it being played on one's travels
[ANNOTATION]	A thinks the game is fun and interesting	Contradiction
A	yeah it's that sort of thing
B	no that's that's your go I don't think we're going to have another game
A	alright there's four of them
B	no that's alright
A	I think there are three
B	no but then you go again
A	oh why cos the last one went on there?
B	yeah and then you can go again by doing another move
A	er don't I get that?
B	no
A	why?
B	cos your last one went over here
A	oh
B	just your ones
A	yeah but can you only go to there and you go you can just skip one?
B	no you can't skip one
A	no of course you can't
B	it's my last one and I'm opposite yours
A	you get you get the opposite and you get the ones that were in your
B	yeah
A	hole
B	use them all up
B	another go
A	I wanna do that thing where you nab the opposite it's not happened yet
B	you've done it
A	I've got another go
B	have another go go there and then you get another move
A	what from there to there?
B	no there and then it's the last one
A	one two three and I can get that one
B	correct
A	one two
B	I've got nothing left so I capture
A	oh
B	all of yours and visually we can tell that I've won
A	yeah
B	alright? play once more?
A	no boring
B	it was boring
B	we're still learning the rules
