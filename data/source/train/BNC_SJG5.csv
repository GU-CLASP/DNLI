A	I know
C	mm
A	gorgeous face no brains
C	yeah
A	that's it
C	or brains but you wouldn't wanna kiss them
A	or brains but you wouldn't wanna kiss them
C	tut
A	it seemed to be that you got one or the other
C	yeah
C	I think it's because anyone that you would actually date is already in a relationship
C	you know
A	yeah
C	happy days
A	happy days
C	anyone you'd actually think about considering
A	so it was huh
C	isn't available
A	it was really gutting
C	mm
A	very disappointed
C	so the I've
[ANNOTATION]	A is not in a relationship at the moment.	Entailment
A	to the point where I er I was actually considering how much of a stalker it would be for me to ask him to take a photograph
A	yeah
C	he might actually have you arrested
A	well yeah of course I wouldn't have actually gone through with it
C	mm
A	photograph him
C	mm
A	like it would be
C	yeah
A	pretty plausible
C	yeah
A	he was gorgeous
C	it er
A	like he could've easily made a living out of it
[ANNOTATION]	He was quite unattractive.	Contradiction
C	that might well be
A	he was like stunning
C	mm
A	you think?
C	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	You can't get arrested because of a picture.	Contradiction
A	yeah
C	I mean I like to think he didn't
A	yeah
C	who can say
A	yeah
C	person
A	mm
C	oh every time I look in my cupboard I see this little remnant of Mini Eggs wrapper and I think huh
A	uh
C	no
[ANNOTATION]	She bought the Mini Eggs at Cosco.	Neutral
A	something really sweet today
C	oh God
A	he um he was saying that

A	that it wasn't oh my God are you alright? What happened? The story
C	thank God you're okay
A	I'll never ask you to pick your dirty socks up ever again
C	mm
A	how sweet
C	in the moment
A	well yeah
C	give it a few days
A	in real life
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	you stay there
A	yeah
C	Cos I've already said er when I got out of the shower I said well I
A	it's so hard to make that much of an allowance with someone isn't it
C	well it's I know it cos it's the  it's the  second time in a week where he's been like yeah I'll come over
A	now I've fucked it up
C	well I
A	yeah
C	like even if no matter how
C	you class it it's rude
A	and can you  can you  class it as rude if it's because he's ill?
C	huh
A	that's what I'm thinking
C	that's the problem
A	I would just smash his face against a wall
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	you
A	write it down  write it down  You know you're going write it on a piece of paper all over the flat
C	I don't know if it's just he's sat down and having a beer
A	but you can still tell someone
C	that's the thing
A	yeah
C	and he's like oh I just didn't think
A	yeah
C	a lack of consideration
A	yeah it is
C	yeah
A	at the risk of sounding perverse with my penis
C	oh thanks love
A	have you tried them on?
C	I haven't tried it on yet
A	Small ones
C	yeah
A	that is wise
C	mm
A	it wouldn't be as feminine
C	yeah
A	Cos the boy blazer makes it
C	Good
A	it came into my head
C	oh God
A	yeah
C	so I need to make an effort
A	yeah
C	okay
C	um to have my nails done
A	oo
C	tomorrow
A	yeah
A	yeah
C	that's just not fun times
A	no
A	I don't like the bread really crispy
C	oh okay
A	it's just got to be cooked enough for the butter to melt
C	so it's yeah so it is warm
A	no
C	Cos that would be  that would be  wrong
A	I think that should be about it
A	oh
C	when you said you were gonna eat the whole garlic bread I thought you meant like you're gonna eat both loaves
C	and in my head I was like that's quite a lot of garlic bread
A	that's a lot of bread
C	but then I was thinking actually I probably could eat a whole thing
A	you see the thing this is I used to get annoyed with my mum about this
C	mm?
A	like she knew she was forgetful
C	mm
A	yeah
C	people who are late or er people who just don't think
A	yeah
C	some extent
A	I don't have any patience with it at all
C	um
A	I think it's because I cannot believe truly believe that somebody could not think that
C	yeah
A	do you know what I mean?
C	yeah
A	er there's no way on this planet that that didn't enter into your head to do and you chose not to do it as opposed to just didn't think
C	yeah
A	it came in your head
C	yeah
A	not that I didn't think
C	yeah
A	beer
C	oh nice
A	I'll rescue said beer
C	that's definitely necessary
A	should be cold enough now
C	yeah
A	mm
C	oh nice
A	por you madame
C	vielen Dank mon amie
[ANNOTATION]	Person C is not sure that the coldness is that much delightful	Neutral
C	it's just unbelievable
A	huh
C	think it might be
A	all the
C	all the learning
A	all the learning
C	it's necessary
A	all the learning
[ANNOTATION]	Person A think all the learning were unbelievable	Entailment
C	mm
C	shall we read about he set me on fire
A	yes
A	my
C	he set me on fire
A	I mean why wouldn't he set you on fire? Is obviously the next question
C	um
C	yes
A	really? It actually says that?
C	yeah
A	thought you were taking the mick
C	what the blazes? That's what the article's called
A	yep
C	Sunday morning
[ANNOTATION]	Person C had forgotten about the social security	Contradiction
A	for breakfast
C	yep
A	sorry I forgot?
C	what the fuck is the matter with this kid? Look I'm not kidding
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Person A think the kid is acting very weird	Neutral
C	oh fuck off
A	so but I mean that that is a very very far-fetched story
C	no no
A	mm
C	that's er that's that's clearly what's happened
A	yeah
C	knowing that I was ready
[ANNOTATION]	Person C just want to say that is was not his fault at all	Neutral
A	why would you do that?
C	to eat dinner
A	yeah
C	mm
A	is send the message
C	he can fuck off
[ANNOTATION]	Person C  was followed by the guy was taken picture by him	Contradiction
A	he's on his own planet  he's on his own planet
C	it's been ages
A	is the guy from next door?
C	no the guy is just the guy he works for
A	oh
C	like a contractor
A	oh
C	the guy that he was waiting home so that the guy who he's been doing a job for this week can come round and pay him
A	right
C	okay
A	right
C	and I was clearly saying right well you come round and then we'll get some food
A	sorry I'm on the way out
C	right okay
A	mm
C	frustration
A	is not that he said all this crap happened to him
C	yeah
A	in the first place
C	no
A	sometimes you feel a bit obliged to kind of go okay then
C	yeah
A	mm
A	even once to accept it to know then then you're gonna turn up to see your mates stoned when you're not stoned when
C	yeah
A	she isn't
C	yeah
A	so the best will in the world if he didn't think it was gonna touch him there was no point in doing it
C	yeah
A	and if it did he knows that at least for an hour no matter how little he smokes he's stoned
C	yeah
A	mm
C	no
A	but if he come round now are you only gonna say it to his face anyway?
C	mm
A	yeah
C	I wanna understand why he
A	yeah
C	why he did it
A	make him take the shit to his face then
C	does it?
A	yeah
C	have you got enough to share? Are you sure?
A	oh yeah
C	definitely full
A	no thank you
C	mm
A	if he's whitied he's gonna be sick for ages yet ain't he?
C	well yeah
A	and the problem is it then makes you into the bad person
C	yeah
A	of being the person to put up the guns all the time
C	the one who gets annoyed
A	yeah
C	mm
A	no
C	no
A	argumentative or
C	no
A	mm mm
C	speaking of
A	mhm
C	at the party
C	thanks
A	yep
C	I'd only popped round to drop off a top I'd borrowed
A	does he mean yeah he wants a lift? What's the message you sent again?
C	I'm sorry you're feeling sick
A	yep
C	you might have to come in the car so I don't murder him
C	I'll tell I'll
A	yeah
C	I loved my hair
A	on sad note
C	note that
A	yeah
C	but now Music Channel was on the TV playing chart songs
A	right
C	huh
C	eruption
A	I don't really understand the link between the hair-doing
C	mm mm
A	ah
C	Mate dig in
C	Cos
A	mm
C	yeah
A	oh no it's good
C	it's alright isn't it
A	people laughing
C	it had clearly been a good night
A	mm
C	I knew most of the people there
A	how old is she? Have we has she told us yet?
C	no
A	she hasn't told us yet has she
C	child
A	yeah
C	well when she wrote this
A	yep
C	everything I said he'd make some kind of quip
A	mm
C	I'd been yanked
A	so she didn't put herself out? She rung her mum?
C	she rang her mum
A	right
C	not nine nine nine
A	head in the sink
C	not run down the road
A	first bit of water you'd be there
C	run the bath
A	yeah
C	even
A	you'd go to the bathroom
C	you would
A	wherever you are
C	yeah
A	whether it's just a sink in there or even a toilet
C	yeah
A	wouldn't you
C	get someone to pee on you
C	so the fact that your head's on fire probably tells people that you can't really stop and chat
A	yep
C	minutes later a police car and an ambulance arrived
C	whoever it was had shaved part of
C	only part of it
A	yep
C	mum told me in the hospital
A	no
C	her head was on fire
C	you probably wouldn't tell her
A	insult to injury
A	by the way you've only got half a right eyebrow
C	in the grand scheme of things
A	Don't worry about it
C	back at home I looked at myself in my bedroom mirror and broke down
A	what the hell was wrong with
C	she was probably off shagging someone
A	oo
C	bleurgh
A	no
C	it was done as a prank
A	yeah
C	it also stopped everyone else staring at me
A	yeah
C	with an aerosol
A	what?
C	the hospital specialist was given has given me special cream to try and reduce the scarring but I may need plastic surgery if they don't work
A	jeebus
C	who does that?
A	cock ain't he
C	often they have a statement from the person um sadly
A	er
C	you can read this one
A	oh
A	you do look pretty bad mum
A	uh
A	why would you do that?
C	more Ms please
A	mm
C	of course she did
A	would it work? I don't think so
C	mm mm
A	my eyes opened
A	burned by the shock of the daylight
A	my head was thundering with pain and I could smell vomit
C	uh
A	yep
C	yep
A	she was the only one who ever visited me these days
C	mm
A	I don't want to bury you mum
A	I love it how
A	I was still too drunk to say a word
C	man up mum
A	ten years oh ten years earlier
C	hm
A	maybe we'll find she's traumatized
C	what?
A	yes
A	Good times
C	yeah
A	no
C	people get through a lot worse
A	yeah
C	mm
A	just really suddenly
C	is your name Dot Cotton though? Sherry?

A	um
A	and failure heaped on top of depression I started drinking three
C	mm
A	she's out of
C	mm
A	no more sherry
C	Good stuff
A	I started drinking three litre bottles of cider until they were empty too
C	mm
A	yeah
C	mm
A	might've been a tell-tale sign
C	probably not good for dinner
A	no
C	for like three-year-olds
A	mm
C	Don't think it's good parenting necessarily
A	Good parenting
A	I collapsed at home unconscious and spent two weeks in a coma in hospital
C	from the three bottles of cider
A	from
C	surprised
A	yep

A	what's happened here? I mean she's in a bit of a something over there
A	er
C	huh
C	what? Wait
A	three litres of vodka
C	not per day? Surely?
A	standard binge
C	oh my God
A	and drink until I hit oblivion
C	mm
A	yeah
C	or it could  it could  be twenty-four hours but still
A	one time I'd woken up face down on the lounge floor
C	charming
C	mm
A	I watched her weakly
