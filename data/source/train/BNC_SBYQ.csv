B	he didn't say how it was but he didn't complain about it
A	I think that's the thing
B	yeah well yes I know cos you were complaining quite loudly about it
A	I mean I don't think you realise how I mean it really was awful
B	yeah
A	mm
B	it wasn't that bad
A	em
B	so
A	well I've had it a little bit at other times
B	mm
A	but it was so bad
B	mm
A	um and then you've got the delay and I wasn't sure whether you what you were hearing or what
B	mm
A	it was so bad
B	mm
A	I mean it I I'd been speaking to you for a while before I actually realised that I hadn't heard it and
B	mm
A	you know
B	well fingers crossed maybe that's what it takes to take the sim card out again
A	I mean I don't see
B	maybe it wasn't quite in
A	how these things work but um why that would make a difference
B	ah when I leave I'll call you from the car
A	yeah
B	mm
A	it's got an amazing cast but I think it's probably not a terribly good film
B	mm
A	it's a bit cheesy
B	bits like in the trailer
A	yes and it's terribly cheesy I'm sure
B	mm
A	oh
B	it's going to be a little bit on the patronising side I think
A	oh yes
B	ah aren't these Indian people lovely?
A	mm
B	they're not uncivilised at all
A	mm
B	she she I think because she's she's twenty-four but because she fell out with her parents when she was quite young she moved out when she was sixteen
A	mm
B	so she gives  she gives  the big I am
A	mm
B	and she's very fiercely independent
A	right
B	but at the same time we were having a conversation and she was saying she's on some charity board at work you know as a way of sort of getting further ahead in the company and get involved in stuff
A	right
B	and then but she was saying but our charity this year is something to do with Africa and I said oh what is it? Is it CAFOD or you know Oxfam or
A	mm
B	she said is it one of those big ones? What is it? Amnesty you know? What is it?
A	mm
B	she like oh I don't know
A	right
B	but the  But the  surely right like now that
A	yes
B	in television or other kinds of media
A	yes I
B	but the gulf between
A	mm
B	how we live and how they live is growing all the time
A	mm
B	you know they're they're getting poorer
A	mm
B	as we get
A	yes
B	richer effectively the west as a whole
A	but that's pathetic though
B	well I agree
A	uh mm
B	they probably do a multitude of things
A	mm
B	like you see these images and it's completely heartbreaking and then it's gone and then you've got a car car advert
A	mm
B	you know it does sort of it only stays with you for a matter of moments
A	uh mm
B	she like yeah oh yeah I'd forgotten all about that
A	it very much is
B	mm
A	in fact
B	mm
A	that's that's certainly the case but
B	so therefore you might as well not doing anything
A	and and and also the idea that you wouldn't give to charity if you couldn't see where it
B	mm
A	what it was doing
B	that was her
A	exactly
B	like can't you see it's a charity and it's helping people
A	yes
B	so why if you're on the board and you didn't know why didn't you ask?
A	it would take  it would take  five minutes on Google to find out what the charity is and
B	mm
A	what it's doing
B	or ask the people if they were making the announcement in the meeting
A	yeah
B	right this is going to be a charity
A	tell us more about it
B	and what they're doing
A	yeah
B	it does seem very strange
A	yes
B	and she said why don't they help themselves? And I thought right don't
A	ooh
B	she said well then how come we've got so civilised in the west and they haven't got
B	and I thought oh god
A	oh my god
B	oh no
A	that's that's well that's the case with a lot of people I think
B	mm
A	and there is this perception which the west has done nothing to try and challenge that the west is civilised
B	mm
A	and everybody else isn't
B	well that's what I said did you not see soldiers going into countries now and pillaging and raping? Nothing's has really changed
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker Be believes that the west has pillaged in other countries	Entailment
A	yeah
B	than people in those countries
A	what's what's civilised about that?
B	and in fact we actually all come from Africa we come from them
A	mm
B	you know and the reason is we've we've
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A believes the west to be uncivilized	Entailment
A	also the fact  the fact  that um a lot of Africa was fertile land
B	mm
A	um and it's become lesser because um if land is cleared
B	mm
[ANNOTATION]	You cannot grow plants in Africa	Contradiction
A	um then you get um what do they call it? Um
B	oh god
A	or there's very little because it's all been um I mean you know we're talking about decades of drought
B	oh yeah yeah yeah
A	where it used to be fertile
B	mm
A	um but with um
B	mm
A	and then you had drought and then when you have rain it washes the top soil away
B	yeah
A	so um it's there's a  there's a  whole range of things
B	well absolutely
A	and and that's not true
B	that's not true
A	also you do have to deal with  you do have to deal with  corrupt
[ANNOTATION]	Clearing land makes it infertile	Entailment
B	yeah
A	um governments
B	well in Cuba the money never actually
[ANNOTATION]	There is still a lot of fertile land in Africa	Neutral
A	mm
B	they've all got a basic living allowance but they could have more
A	mm
B	but because they they live in a socialist country
A	mm
B	their their government the people the clothes they're getting for example and then they sell them off
A	mm
B	to another third world country and make profit and then keep the money for themselves
[ANNOTATION]	Cuba is a socialist country	Entailment
A	mm
B	in Haiti they're still living in shanty towns
A	I know
B	they're still living in tents under the subway
A	because the money the money isn't going to where it should
B	no
A	corruption is is a huge thing
B	mm
A	so
B	mm
A	will have a vested interest in in choosing this route
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	The population of Haiti is 6.000.000 people.	Neutral
A	rather than you know just actually kind of handing it over and helping the people that really need it
B	mm
A	so the people on
B	mm
A	and that  And that  happens whether it's you know America or Africa
B	oh absolutely
A	so there's no difference there
B	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Haiti is a fair country.	Contradiction
A	mm
B	and trying to make it so that it's not them and us
A	mm
B	you know
A	mm it is
B	you know I'm ignorant to a lot of I as well
A	mm
B	but I think I try and read about stuff at the same time
A	well yeah and be open to it
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B doesn't read much.	Contradiction
A	absolutely
B	I reckon I'm a bit of a goldfish
A	mm
B	I try and investigate it I might read a book or I might go online or I might
A	yeah
B	that's sort of the nature of it
[ANNOTATION]	Goldfish don't live much.	Neutral
A	mm
B	they're far away therefore
A	mm
B	I shouldn't give them money
A	there's also um you've got things like small farmers who try and sell
B	mm
A	um the World Health Organisation and the World Trade Organisation people like this you know they're set up to sort of provide um kind of help and sort of
[ANNOTATION]	The World Trade Organisation serve humanitarian purposes.	Entailment
B	mm
A	an overseeing kind of role
B	mm
A	but they're hugely corrupt as well
B	mm hm
A	and and and even if they're not you know the balance is is out
B	mm
[ANNOTATION]	The World Health Organisation is not much better than Haiti's corruptive system.	Entailment
A	I mean they're there to sort of oversee like fair trade and trade agreements between countries and continents
B	mm
A	but actually the balance is always tipped in favour of the rich countries
B	mm
A	and the very large corporations I mean Monsanto has a huge clout
B	mm
A	in places like this
B	mm
A	and which has been done for centuries
B	mm
A	and sold at a fraction of the price in African markets where their own farmers can't sell their own stuff
B	mm
A	because it's all to do with um trade balances and the
B	mm
A	in order to um you know
B	mm
A	so they're having to accept cheap imports which means that their their own farmers can't sell their own produce
B	oh
A	in order to make a living
B	mm
A	but it's all to do with this you know we must have trade
B	mm
A	you must accept X Y and Z and we will take A B and C
B	yeah
A	and it's it's the corporations and it's the  it's the  UK and
B	mm
A	who make who have the power to say to to the WTO
B	mm
A	you must you know this is what we're gonna do and you've got to agree to it
B	mm
A	and they do and you know the poorer countries have no say in the matter
B	no
A	they have to accept it
B	it's all run by money isn't it?
A	because they want to be able to trade
B	mm
A	but it's the balance is wrong
B	mm
A	it's not like they can actually help themselves because they're always coming up against
B	yeah
A	more powerful and richer governments and corporations well
B	bloody hell
A	they're the same thing these days
B	mm
A	so it's it's like it's it's not even possible to do that even even if it  if it  had been in the past
B	yeah
A	most destitute people
B	yeah
A	are those who can't even feed you know if if they  if they  weren't growing enough to to be able to trade to sell it at least they could actually just feed themselves and their families but they can't
B	but they can't do that
A	because they live in the poorest areas where you know
B	they can't grow anything
A	there's there's no water and the the land is is poor and won't you know they can't grow anything so
B	mm
A	if they  If they  had money and could live somewhere else they could do it but they don't I mean they're at the bottom of the pile they have nothing
B	mm
A	yeah
B	and you've just got nothing and
B	mm
A	how if you if you're that poor how can you work harder to get on?
B	mm
A	these people
B	as you say
A	absolutely
B	mm
A	for no return
B	I know
A	that's a it's a ridiculous thing to even say
B	mm
A	anyway well good for you for challenging her but
B	well I'm not as um well read on the subject either
A	yeah
B	like if it's not my country but it's not in front of me if I can't see the direct impact my money's going to give me
A	mm
B	I'm not gonna engage with it
A	mm
B	and understand it
A	that's the
B	you can't be in the Navy
A	that's the kind of person they want
B	but that's what they like
A	that is they don't want people to question things
B	no
A	if you see soldiers start to question things that's when they have breakdowns and that's when they leave and they
B	mm
A	have to do something else
B	they drill that out of you
A	yeah
B	no they want sheep
A	yes
B	even officers
A	oh yeah
B	officers don't have to be told what to do it just cascades down
A	well
B	well yeah because they're this is  this is  why she is doing it now this is the last year she can do it cos she's five years out of university
A	mm
B	you can only be an officer if you're within that five years
A	oh
B	because I think that um you know you've got those life skills that you would need
A	right
B	to go to university therefore you must be a cut above which is what they call ratings which is your cannon fodder
A	yes
B	so if you're out if I wanted to apply which obviously I would never do I would go in as ratings
A	mm
B	but the I mean the money's ridiculous
A	oh
B	disgusting isn't it? And there's people out
A	Good god
B	out in Afghanistan with you know malfunctioning kits and you think they're actually paying people around forty grand a year
A	they are cutting back
B	within the services
A	absolutely
B	so it seems strange
A	I know
B	why you would look at everything just across the board
A	mm
B	but she had her entry exam the other day and she passed
A	mm
B	even though she's got she's long sighted or is she short sighted? Is it when you can see you can't see here but you can't see over there that's short sighted?
A	yeah
B	yeah so she's short sighted
A	mm
B	probably a size fourteen but she's been trying to lose weight for ages and she can run
A	mm
B	and when she went for the entry exam the guy said right at this point you know those of you have passed need to do this and this to get ready for your fitness
A	oh
B	and you should be swimming once a week and you should be  you should be  doing weight training
A	okay
B	and he said okay so how fast are you running it? And he she said fifteen and a half and he said and I don't mean to be rude but how heavy are you? And she said however heavy she is maybe like thirteen fourteen stone
A	yeah
B	but I cannot believe that you at your weight can run and your heart can take it
A	mm
B	he said if you turned up for your medical now you wouldn't pass
A	mm
B	and if they saw that she was fourteen stone but running it at fifteen and a half minutes they'd think she was lying and dismiss her out of hand
A	right
B	before having to actually have the fitness
A	mm
B	training situations because she's going in as an officer with problem solving and you've got to get your team of across
A	mm
B	some issue and then you've got to go out running around in your pack
A	mm
B	if you're in the services obviously
A	yeah
B	that's what you have to prepare yourself for
A	yeah
B	she said no no no
A	she could be going over to the Falklands
B	yeah
A	mm
B	um there have been and there will be um
A	so just tell her to look up I can't remember his name
B	who is he?
A	um he was terribly burnt um
B	oh yeah
A	in one in in one of those ships that was hit during the Falklands
B	yeah
A	it was
B	I know who you mean
A	yeah
B	did it begin with B?
A	no that was the that
B	that was the Argentine
A	the Argentinean one that that we blew up as it was sailing away
B	yeah and then she said it was a danger
A	Maggie lied
B	yeah
A	she lied through her teeth
B	disgusting
A	eR the Belgrano that was
B	oh that was that's it yeah
A	um I can't remember what the ship was called
B	well I think she's she's not being very realistic of what they're expecting
A	mm
B	she's got no idea about
A	the thing is in the Middle East um you know where where the tensions are in the Straits of Hormuz
B	mm
A	that's where Iran is blocking the shipping
B	mm
A	so if the tension ratchets up there
B	yeah
A	more
B	it will be the Navy
A	so tell her that
B	yeah
B	you're going to Iran
A	I don't like people who just accept what their told why you know
B	well that's
A	we should all think for ourselves
B	well that's the thing about her I would never have pegged her as somebody
A	mm
B	but I think she thinks that she's going in as a as an officer she could tell everyone else what to do but it's not going to work like that
A	uh
B	so I don't know
A	she'll probably love it
B	well I don't know
A	mm
B	that she that it will be the perfect job but in theory
A	mm
B	if she was more engaged with what she was actually going to be doing I'd think yeah fine
A	mm
B	go right ahead
A	mm
B	being realistic
A	mm
B	sort of worries you a little
A	is it?
B	yeah
A	why?
B	well a couple of weeks ago she and I went out drinking and we came home quite late and we woke everybody up
A	that's right you you did yes
B	and it was awful and I was really embarrassed
A	yeah
B	and I had never done it before
A	mm
B	and eh we apologised to everyone in the house the next day
A	mm
B	and we felt very guilty
A	yeah
B	behind them and
A	yeah
B	where it's it all we had a conversation with her about it
A	it got tense yeah
B	yeah and it's been a bit frazzled ever since
A	mm
A	mm
B	and she is incredibly heavy footed
A	mm
B	bangs around everywhere
A	mm
B	um and her room is above
A	mm
B	so she's in at half nine and cooks dinner at ten o'clock just like
A	no
B	and she doesn't think that eight o'clock in the morning is early
A	mm
B	and doesn't
A	well you know eight o'clock isn't early
B	well no but it is
A	well the weekend I suppose is different yeah
B	so the point is the door should be closed up until ten o'clock which is what put on the door
A	mm
B	from ten PM unto ten AM
A	mm
B	because you can all agree that that's you know if you want to have a lie in
A	that's fair enough
B	that's fair enough
A	yeah
B	but
A	mm
B	she might have a lie in the morning and so
A	mm
A	mm
B	and she's stormed out of her room said to the Spanish girls why don't you keep the door closed? People are trying to sleep
A	mm
B	and she said no she's awake and she said well you know she might not be you don't know that and keep the door closed and it went and it just got really nasty
A	no
A	mm
B	and I thought I'm not gonna wade in
A	oh dear
[ANNOTATION]	Everyone wants to party and not sleep.	Contradiction
B	it's hard and
A	no
B	he started seeing a girl about a month less than a month ago and he was there every night for a week
A	mm
B	it turns out the father of her two children her ex husband had an affair with
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	The ex husband had always been loyal.	Contradiction
B	turns out it's this fellow
A	that's so
B	weird
A	mm
B	with her boss's husband
A	okay
A	mm
B	I think she's got some quite dark issues
A	mm
B	um and she just called it a day a couple weeks ago and now they're back together again
A	mm
B	double
[ANNOTATION]	Two people managed to bury the hatchet.	Entailment
A	mm
B	the fact that she so quickly and so readily allowed you to meet the kids
A	some women are just they just don't
B	I think
A	it doesn't bother them that their kids have a succession of uncles
B	it's really bad
A	but think
[ANNOTATION]	Women want always to have children exclusively.	Contradiction
B	well I thought that would be the standard you know that you'd put your kids first
A	some women are just some women don't
B	if you that desperate for a bit of male attention?
A	I think so
B	that you lurch from bloke to bloke
A	mm
B	you're gonna have to trust her or
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B believes that once you have kids, they should be a top priority.	Entailment
B	if you think there's something not to trust have it out with her
A	mm
B	but the fact that she's so willingly allowed her kids to meet him
A	mm
B	is a bit concerning
A	mm
B	you know when it's just you that's fine
[ANNOTATION]	Nothing seems to be weird according to speaker B.	Contradiction
A	no it's different
B	it's very different
A	it's a bit weird
B	it seems a bit strange
A	yeah it is yeah
B	every day I would get a new instalment
A	mm
B	it's quite nice not to be at the centre of any of the dramas
A	yeah I mean it must be a bit wearing
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	turns out that
A	why?
B	A few weeks ago um
A	yeah
B	so
A	yeah and took it out
B	and it seemed to be better
A	mm
B	so he came and made it warmer or whatever
A	mm
B	and then recently it's been running really hot
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	person B know recently it is been hot	Entailment
B	if you're the first person it's fine but after that it's just it's really really really hot
A	and you can't adjust it?
B	no you have when you turn it right down it doesn't go down
A	and it's a crap shower
[ANNOTATION]	they are not sure about water that is it hot or not	Neutral
B	who's actually qualified to come round and have a look at it? He said she said well it's very hard you know? What I'm I supposed to do? Fix it?
A	yes
B	Don't moan to me well you know I had to get Clive to take the coil out and I said what's the coil? And she said oh the regulator
A	mm
B	she's a horror and she it's just the fact that she makes out to be your fault when there's an issue
A	mm
B	you think actually love this is what you get when you have the houses for rent
A	mm
B	you've got issues
A	exactly
B	I do resent having to pay rent when there's you know faulty
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about a film	Contradiction
A	exactly
B	faulty amenities
A	well maybe you should look around?
B	yeah I always keep my eyes peeled
A	mm
B	I mean it is cheap and it does mean at the moment actually I'm doing better about paying my overdraft off than I thought I would be
A	mm hm good
[ANNOTATION]	they are not sure can see faulty amenities or not	Neutral
B	um particularly with this recording of the conversations
A	do you now?
B	yes
A	oh that's not bad
B	yeah it's pretty good
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about party	Contradiction
A	eighteen Pounds an hour?
B	eighteen Pounds an hour
A	yeah
B	but that includes all the documents you have to fill out as well
A	okay
B	I have to get you to sign a consent form
A	okay
B	what your opening lines were was it was it a discussion? Was there anecdote telling?
A	mm
B	you know
B	bless you
B	bless you
A	oh dear
B	more and more of our books in our corpus informed
A	okay
B	so you're helping innit?
A	um yes so it's just a one off though?
B	oh good
A	I hope it was
B	you haven't got the plague
A	no I don't think so
B	my penicillin is starting to really kick in now
A	sorry?
B	my penicillin is really kicking in now
A	Good
B	or whatever it is they gave me
A	it is yeah
B	some sort of
A	it is penicillin
B	yeah
A	it's just the broad broad spectrum as they call it
B	maybe that's what it is then
A	that's not a rash though
B	um no
A	that's not a rash
B	oh right
A	yeah
B	Cos there's there's there's a lot of them
A	it's not
B	there's probably about three four
A	they're not very big or either so
B	no
A	I don't know  I don't know
B	then it's not a problem
A	I think you might be
B	well I think we can tell that
A	no
B	I mean it does take half an hour to cycle
A	I know but that's
B	but what time did dad say he left? Did he leave just after me?
A	about five minutes before
B	you called
A	I called him whenever that was
B	five twenty-four or five past two er one
A	mm
B	he's at
A	yeah he's he's he's gonna come round but he said in about an hour um
B	right
A	but um I mean we could pop out
B	no but look I might I thought
A	oh you were really
B	well I'm bringing the other one back for
A	yeah
B	so I might as well bring this one back at the same time
A	yeah and finish it off that's fine
B	but really um it's been great
A	I think it's really good
B	yeah it's really well written
A	yeah exactly
B	it makes you think like um
A	have you read about the births?
B	put me off for life
A	it did
B	Christ
A	well shall we  shall we  pop out for a bit?
B	yeah shall we? Let's do that
A	it would be quite nice just to
