A	how many bulbs did you buy in the end?
B	I bought two hundred snowdrop bulbs and that's four different varieties of snowdrops fifty of each so I think we put them in the little verge at the front and I think we put them in clumps of about ten
A	that would be lovely what kind of snowdrops did you are they particular kinds?
B	oh I can't remember some big some small some double some single
A	did you just go for quantity or did you go for the kind that are more attractive?
B	no no the
A	because they're taller or double featured or whatever
B	no there were four different kinds that were on sale and I thought I'd get some of each of them
A	and when are there are arriving?
B	hopefully they are arriving in the next day or so
A	right
B	so that's another task that we can
A	and do they have to go in straight away
B	they don't have to go in straight away they do have to go in sooner rather than later
A	I can't remember when we put bulbs in last year
B	we tend to put them in quite late we tend to put them in in sort of November
A	when it's dark and wet and cold
B	when it's dark and wet and cold so this time we'll do in October when it's dark and wet and cold
A	mm
B	and the trees or the tree is arriving on Wednesday or Thursday
A	and where are you going to put that?
B	almond tree
A	oh right
B	so under the underneath the apple tree
A	right
B	it says you can't have it near a peach tree
A	oh
B	but we haven't got a peach tree so it doesn't really matter if you have it near a peach tree then they cross pollinate and your almonds taste of peaches
A	no that that can't be true
B	that's what it says on the internet and the internet never lies
A	yeah right
B	no that's
A	no it's never have almonds in it
B	anyway erm so yeah so the bulbs are coming this week and they're
A	right
B	erm but that means that we can't have the soft fruit
A	unless we have it at the front of the lawn
B	we could
A	mm
B	er but it only gets sun until
A	is there anywhere that gets sun all day?
B	probably not which is a bit of a pain isn't it?
A	we've got such a big plot and yet there isn't a bit which does get sun all day
B	no I know erm
A	which cherry tree?
B	the cherry tree in the pot
A	oh right okay I thought we were gonna put it where it stands?
B	okay but it's so well no I thought erm that the almond tree might look might nice with the plum tree at the top of the garden
A	aren't we gonna put all the nuts together?
B	what nuts have we got?
A	I thought we were going to put the nuts?
B	what other nuts have we got?
A	well walnut
B	what walnut?
A	the walnut down in that corner
B	what walnut?
A	the one that got eaten by the date but no is it a walnut? no it's not a walnut no I didn't buy a walnut in the end because apparently it poisons everything within ten metres of it
B	okay
A	well I don't know
B	well we could we could put the
A	mm
B	but erm but the apple tree's not done well down there
A	no but I think that's
B	for anyone who's listening this isn't our own domestic deer this is a deer that walked in from the forest
B	well if there's
A	have we got a pet deer?
B	the deer ate the apple tree
A	it's a passing deer
B	yes
A	it's a itinerary itinerant deer
B	yes
A	yeah
B	erm and I'd like to thin out a lot of the weeds in the beds as well
A	the weeds in the beds?
B	at the back and at the front
A	oh right okay is there a lot of weeds?
B	yes
A	oh no we need to tackles the trees though cos that sycamore is back
B	when did you do that?
A	and then I think I sprayed it so it's looking really black and twisted and horrible but it is never less persisting in growing lots and lots of little
B	okay well we can kill those bastards
A	and also I need to get up more trees
B	when's that on the second of December?
A	er thirteenth of December something around there
B	okay
A	there's a planting of the
B	and who is going to be actually doing the planting?
A	I don't know there's a whole day where
B	mm where is it?
B	is there a wood in
A	not yet but there will be
B	okay
A	I don't know really I don't know what there is
B	mm
A	this week?
B	yeah
A	well not if it's gonna rain like this
B	no
A	yeah
B	couple of hours three hours four hours
A	mm
B	yeah
A	mm
B	not happy about that
A	well no that's a bit strange that its collapsed already
B	mm
A	when my dad bought a shed off the internet he bought a metal shed and the door was defective
B	I've heard this story
A	have you?
B	yes I heard it in real time and I've heard it since a number of times as well
A	but that's annoying because that's the kind of thing where
B	mm
A	you know you just keep on moaning and moaning and nobody takes any notice of you
B	mm
A	did you do anything to it to make it fall apart?
B	what like using it?
B	have you used it?
A	yeah but I thought the log splitter was a bit heavier I thought that was really pushing it to its Nth degree that one
B	no it can deal with much more than that
A	eh?
B	yeah
A	mm
B	and basically if you if you move the erm
A	mm
B	then it just unlocks the
A	but then that's not a self-locking nut is it? it's
B	well exactly that's why I'm a bit cross
A	it's the self
B	it's an
A	mm
B	turned out I'm not happy
A	I can imagine it's not
B	I'm not happy about that
A	well no but this is is this the penalty of buying things off the internet? you can't actually see them before you buy them
B	it would've done better with a cotter pin
A	oh would it?
B	instead of a split pin
A	you don't even know what a cotter pin is do you?
B	yes I do
A	do you?
B	yeah it's like a split pin
A	and what's a split pin?
B	it's a pin that's split
B	don't taunt me in front of others
A	well this is a new variable life you see you were an urban creature before and now you're a rural creature and you're learning about these cotter pin and split pins
B	I knew what cotter pins was before I
A	bulbs
B	moved out of London
A	now know what a bulb is
A	I know it's very strange isn't it it's a very savage colour
B	mm
A	that's if it stops raining
B	yeah and I also need to split logs and to get the chainsaw out as well
A	you're not going to split logs when I'm not here are you?
B	why not?
A	because isn't it dangerous doesn't it need two people?
B	no
A	shouldn't I supervise you just in case there's an industrial accident?
B	well you okay I won't
A	what if I went out and I came home and the house was all quiet and dark and I couldn't find you and then I went down to the garage and there you were split in two by your log splitter and there'd be blood all over the garage
B	is that likely to happen that I would get split in two?
B	it's more likely that I'd lose a finger
A	yeah but what would you do if you lost a finger
B	well I'd look for it
A	would you have your mobile phone with you if you were log splitting in the garage?
B	possibly possibly
A	well you'd have to crawl back to the house wouldn't you to get your mobile phone
B	I wouldn't have to crawl
A	you might not make it
B	I can walk without a finger
A	you could be fainting you could be light headed
B	I could
A	there could be blood going everywhere
B	well okay well I won't do that tomorrow then I
A	it might make your phone malfunction cos of all the blood
A	mm
B	and what are you going to do? you're so drunk for anyone who's listening she's drunk
B	no
A	on Wednesday?
B	yeah
A	oh who's that?
B	I've never heard of him
A	that
B	can you talk into the recorder please?
A	sorry
B	what are you?
A	on Wednesday?
B	yeah
A	I don't know well we're waiting for the
B	are we?
A	yep
A	it comes from a post across the road
B	right
A	and it comes back to the house but but the post it comes from is over the other side of the road so I think the post outside
B	mm
A	so I think I'm gonna say to the phone engineers they've got to come off that post and come to the back of the house where the electricity comes in
B	okay
A	and then that means they can come through the wall there by the bathroom
B	yeah
A	and then there's a minimum amount of wiring inside the house
B	okay
A	does that make sense?
B	through the radiator
A	through the radiator? no that would be that would be
B	yes
A	erm
B	yeah it's the
A	I don't think it could go that way
B	above the bathroom?
A	between the window and the bathroom door
B	avoiding the radiator
A	well it would be up higher than the radiator
B	yeah okay
A	if I can persuade him to do that but I think he's got to put in a master BT switch of something
B	okay well
A	he will do but we've got to persuade him to do what we want rather than taking the easy route into the house really
B	yes
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	or they're quite happy to use phone lines and in fact it's not even Talktalk that's coming it's BT open reach that's coming
B	yeah
A	so theoretically they've got authority to use the phone lines and things it might be he's got a better connection than we've got
B	we've got fibre optic he's got copper wire
A	is that worse?
B	yes
A	no they're saying BT open reach were using erm
B	okay but the
A	isn't it?
B	no
A	and what does that mean?
B	it means that it's not as fast as fibre optic
A	isn't it?
B	no
A	well we've got superfast
B	we've got extraordinarily fast
A	well
B	erm
B	I don't
A	why not?
B	I'm sure he does but I'm not sure that he does
A	is that better or worse?
B	I don't know I don't know I don't know
A	he thinks it's better
B	fine
A	there is a problem on a Friday sometimes
B	no
A	that's true it is true
B	that's nothing to do with
A	if I have a problem and I can't get online it's on a Friday when you're here
B	it's nothing to do with that
A	well
B	it really is nothing to do with that
A	something happens
B	mm
A	erm
B	okay
A	but there's not enough time to organise a Freesat or the alternatives to
B	er well can I just they're turning up on Wednesday
A	no there's no piece of paper saying they'll turn up on Wednesday when they didn't turn up on the first
B	right
A	mm
B	he can have his own phone if he wants his own phone he can have his own
A	well he would have to have his own phone wouldn't he? he wants his they want they're own phone so they'd need to pay for their own phone
B	how do you mean?
A	if you just had
B	can you talk into the thing please
A	sorry if you just had a phone
B	yeah
A	rather then if he had broadband and television
B	yeah
A	but does he get his
B	no
[ANNOTATION]	Person B think he didn't get his facilities for internet	Entailment
A	there's nothing we can do about that now is there?
B	no because it's his contract
A	I suppose over time
B	he will always say he will always say that he's locked into a contract
A	mm
B	so you know
A	has it does it has it done it because he thinks he knows better than you?
[ANNOTATION]	Person A think the way that he think is not true ,like he it better that others	Neutral
B	I have no idea no he's done it because he thinks he knows best
A	I think he also thinks that unless he has a contract with them he can't keep his email address
B	erm
A	but you can keep your email address
B	you can keep your email address you don't need a television contract to keep your email address
A	no that's true
B	well
[ANNOTATION]	Person B is saying having email is might be independence from  having Tv contract	Neutral
A	will he get better broadband?
B	if you thinks if you think if you think
A	will get better broadband here than he's had before?
B	I don't well he would get better broadband than he's had before because he's got shit broadband before but it it's not good value for money to pay for something that you don't need
A	no but he'll he'll be thinking well if I'm on the same circuit as them they'll be able to see my emails or something
B	but he's not thinking that at all he's just thinking this is what I want
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Person A is going to have a sandwich	Contradiction
B	which is why he's brought his entire house with him
B	so actually he's not he hasn't actually worked out that he's not living in his own house any more
A	yes well
B	yes well I think we do owe them thousands of pounds
A	but that doesn't explain why they haven't stopped billing us since they read the meter
B	well
A	I know but if they thought that we owed them several thousand pounds why would they wait until October to bill us?
[ANNOTATION]	Person A think they might thing they owed them	Neutral
B	I don't know
A	is there any chance at all
B	yes there is a chance
A	and we're actually thousands of pounds in advance because the
B	well well we're not thousands of pounds
A	perhaps
B	no the meter was read
A	but we've had
B	so it is possible that I've misread it and it is possible that
A	no no no but erm
B	yes I understand that
A	resulted in the bill
B	I understand that
A	but if somebody went no but the person who came round to read the meter was a human being
B	yeah
A	and they put it in their little machine and they took it away and theoretically then the machine
B	should generate a bill
A	and the fact that is hasn't
B	no
A	did you phone up?
B	no
A	I thought you phoned up?
B	no
A	really? I thought you phoned up and and said why you haven't you billed us?
B	no
A	well we have to throw ourselves on their mercy
B	yep
A	well no bit worrying isn't it?
B	yes
A	making lists
B	what are you making lists you can't make a list we're doing a tape recording at the moment
A	no because you have to say on on the form that you send in what you've been talking about
B	okay
A	bulbs gardening IT connections
B	I know the person who's listening to this must be thoroughly excited by by this conversation
B	I'd imagine it's a human being
A	is there machines that do that sort of thing yet? I don't know
B	well but if if the
A	I wouldn't of thought so
B	if they're listening for
A	no
B	there's about twenty-seven and a half minutes about a minute ago
A	was it?
B	yeah so it's twenty-nine fifteen
A	oh that's half an hour then
B	or is it twenty-eight
A	it has to be in segments of
B	okay it's twenty-eight and a half minutes so far
A	does that mean that we stop at thirty?
B	well we're stop slightly beyond thirty and then they'll
A	well no cos it goes in
B	yeah
A	right okay I don't know if they're anticipating getting tapes of people talking about how long they had to speak for
A	that would be very boring
B	well if everyone's just talking about how long they have to talk for then that's very very boring indeed
B	so okay okay well listen tomorrow we er I mean I will probably be in the house tomorrow
A	what are you going to do tomorrow?
A	mm
B	and we'll do logs
A	but you mustn't do that without me
B	no we'll do that on Wednesday
[ANNOTATION]	They don't know if they are anticipating getting tapes or not of how people talk.	Neutral
A	gardening
B	splitting and
A	gardening accidents
B	oh yes you you
[ANNOTATION]	They won't be splitting with the gardening.	Contradiction
A	you must take your phone to the garage with you if you do log splitting
B	yes you were also talking about
A	in case you
B	whether I would had to limp up the road if I chop my finger off
A	or whether you pass out
B	walk on my hands and knees
A	mm
B	but anyway
A	that's all we're doing on that's all we're doing on Thursday is it eating?
B	yes
