B	oh I didn't realise did your parents go out too?
C	yeah yeah
B	ah
C	so we all we all went out and then
B	nice
C	which was expensive
A	yeah I bet
B	but a nice holiday
D	really was expensive
C	yeah
B	was it nice there?
D	it was
B	worth it?
D	see I I didn't think I thought it was very similar to anywhere else that you could have gone obviously they've got
C	on the coast
D	art deco
C	the architecture was amazing
D	the architecture was the only reason
C	the beach was really nice as well
A	is it quite a Hispanic influence around there?
C	yeah Cuban
A	yeah?
B	yeah I imagine there is in
A	I'd like to go there for that reason
C	yeah they've got an area of the city which we didn't go to which is known as
D	yeah not the safest of areas
B	there's a lot of Spanish were you spoken were people speaking to you in Spanish?
D	yeah
C	yeah there's a lot of yeah so I mean yeah we got asked a few things by people in the street looking for directions in Spanish
B	yeah
A	I heard in the airport it's like all in Spanish
B	yeah we've
C	to be fair like even in Orlando and other bits of America you get a lot of Spanish
A	yeah yeah
D	yeah like most of the American our American friends
C	Florida particularly but erm like
D	yeah she speaks but most of them speak Spanish
unknown_female	yeah
A	all Americans put
C	they do it in schools
B	yeah they do know a bit yeah
A	they're not as good as they make out they are though sometimes
B	sometimes they are
A	we've met quite a few American people who that are like yeah I can speak Spanish and then you chat to them and they can't actually speak Spanish
B	some of them can though
A	in general they all know some Spanish
B	they know more Spanish than we know French
A	yeah
C	we don't have a lot of French people that live here
B	exactly
C	it's slightly different when England is
B	if half the culture was French
C	England has kind of got a lot of
B	I mean
C	different people that speak loads of different languages but not a dominant one compared to English
D	no no not a dominant second
B	cos erm America doesn't have an official English isn't the official
A	yeah that's what I heard yeah
B	language
A	I also heard that they think the amount of Spanish speakers in America's gonna overtake the amount of amount of native English speakers
C	English speakers
B	they'll still keep English as the
A	next twenty or thirty years I think
B	been reading linguistic books
A	do you guys want a drink or anything?
B	so many books
C	erm yeah do you have like a green tea or anything?
B	yeah we do
A	we have green tea coffee some other teas wine anything else?
C	I'll have a green tea
A	yeah
D	do you have fruit teas?
A	I don't know
B	yeah we do I don't actually know if I've got I said yes to green tea but I wouldn't mind
C	if not then a normal tea
B	we do have
A	shall I open the window?
B	yeah sure
C	should probably text
D	yeah
B	super berry redbush
D	oh I'm gonna have a look then
A	yeah go ahead
D	it sounds like a
B	selection
D	what's the peppermint one? is this the peppermint?
A	good for your stomach
B	there's two types of peppermint
A	so you enjoyed America then?
C	yeah I think erm cos my little brother we took him to New York when he was like maybe eighteen months old
A	yeah
C	so that's his only time on like a big flight
A	how old is he now?
C	he just turned twelve
A	yeah
C	and
D	yeah it was really hot like it was really hot
C	it was erm because of the humidity levels they're saying it sort of has a it was feeling like a hundred and ten Fahrenheit which is just about forty is it?
D	yeah
C	over forty
D	it was it was close to forty when we were there like it
B	forty Celsius?
D	yeah
A	forty's horrible anything above forty's just nasty
B	yeah
C	yeah it's kind of
B	anything above thirty's getting a bit high
A	thirty-five is nasty
C	it's a different kind of heat though as well cos like
D	it's you know even if you're in the shade you feel it
A	yeah yeah
B	yeah yeah yeah yeah the difference in
A	even Korea I mean Korea's not that far south but the humidity was like a hundred percent for two months of the year
D	oh really?
B	it doesn't cool down like at any point in the day
A	and like the shade and the sun is no different yeah it's just like being in a sauna the whole time
B	it's not like in England when you like stand in the shade and the air feels cooler there is no air to feel cool
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	it's just like thick
A	so and if there is a breeze it feels like a hairdryer or something
B	yeah yeah it's like hot air blowing in your face
D	yeah I think I mean to be fair I think it was lower humidity than that but
A	yeah
B	yeah
D	cos I've been in a hundred percent humidity and
A	it's like a sauna
D	it's just ridiculous
A	anything equatorial and on sea level is generally like that
D	yeah
B	you do need air con did you have? you would have had air con
D	yeah we had air con
B	yeah yeah yeah
D	although
B	was this in
D	that was er
C	erm in
D	but also there was a hurricane and
C	ah yeah there was like a tropical storm in the Bahamas
D	in the Bahamas
C	which was causing quite a lot of wind
D	so we had the wind from that which was cooling it down it was rather nice actually
B	oh well
C	which was nice actually
B	yeah yeah
C	it's like you're walking along feeling really hot and then all of a sudden there'd be a gust of wind and sort of a very light mist of rain
A	oh lovely
C	it wasn't like proper it was just like ah
A	have you ever been to California?
C	no
D	I have
C	no I haven't you have
A	is the weather there as nice as people say?
D	er
A	like an eternal spring
D	so San San Francisco's very like
A	yeah okay
D	and then the further south you go the more the hotter it basically goes it goes back to
C	it's huge if you actually think about how big California is
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	it's ridiculous absolutely ridiculous we went to
B	yeah
D	ah I've always wanted to go to
C	cos where did you go? you went to
D	er we went
D	we went to
B	oh
A	we didn't really do much
B	yeah we didn't really have any money
B	yeah
A	so they were never on together when we were so we just kind of chilled with them in the house
B	oh yeah
C	it's like
D	oh my god you've never played Magic the Gathering?
A	it's quite good
D	it's like
D	it was it was like
A	if you like games do you like Battlestar?
D	I've never played Battlestar
A	oh the Battlestar boardgame's pretty good
B	it was pretty good there's a secret cylon
D	where's the one I played with
C	I didn't play it with you I dunno
A	we would never have played board games before but our
B	oh
A	Battlestar one
B	and we played Magic with them that was the gateway into it they chose Magic
C	I really like games I mean it goes back to probably when I was little and like I never had it but we I I think I bought it and it didn't really work I bought it in a charity shop but er some friends when I was growing up erm had
B	oh vaguely
C	they had a video
B	yeah yeah ah I always saw the adverts for that and never played it
D	what?
B	yeah it was like to scare you or something wasn't it?
C	yeah it was like you had to write down your nightmare and put them in a bag in the middle of the thing and you had to
A	sounds weird
C	it's like a weird creepy game but it was something that was very very big in the nineties
B	yeah yeah
A	I always liked Mousetrap
B	oh
C	Mousetrap
A	Grape Escape
C	Grape Escape was the biggest pile of shit ever
A	you know Grape Escape
A	nobody else has ever known it
C	because you have
B	grape
C	you got this tub of Playdough and a mould where you had to make the grapes
A	yeah
C	before you could squash them and that was really tedious
A	yeah it was really tedious
D	what was it called?
B	Grape Escape
C	Grape Escape
D	what?
A	Kerplunk there wasn't a worse game than Kerplunk
B	Kerplunk's a terrible game yeah
D	I played so much cards growing up I must have never played
C	it's true
B	board game board games
A	yeah we got bored of
B	yeah
A	so like what was the queen's
B	we made one successful game
A	the queen's cheese it was a really good game
B	yeah we made some really crappy games as well
C	do you remember what they're called?
B	I don't think they all had names
A	no
B	the queen's cheese
A	the queen's cheese stuck
B	yeah
A	that was a good game
C	would you be able to play a game now of?
A	no
B	no no no we've tried to recreate it
A	with our friends from
B	yeah yeah but no we lost we lost that memory
A	yeah
B	smoked it away probably
A	too many cigarettes
B	mm
A	the apartment's spacious at least it's private although nobody told us we have a nursery
B	ah it's terrible
B	yeah but during the week
A	but we'll be studying in the day
B	nine to five all you can hear is screaming
A	their screaming
B	children cos they're playing outside every day
C	you'll have to find out
D	well look over the winter maybe you'll be
A	that's what I thought do you like children
D	er I don't like other people's children
C	got three nephews
B	ah have you? have you got just the one brother? no
D	I've got er three brothers
B	oh wow okay
A	big family
B	I forgot about that did you see your brother in America that's in America?
D	yeah we saw him
B	is that a reason for going? yeah
C	well it's a
D	well it it was a bonus
B	yes kill two birds with one stone
A	where are you in the hierarchy of siblings?
D	erm second from last penultimate
A	oh
D	yeah but it's a bit weird cos erm there's seven years between me and the eldest and me and the youngest
A	yeah
D	so I'm
A	so you're equidistant between
D	yeah I'm equidistant so I sort of feel like I'm in the middle but
A	but I guess you can't be in the middle
D	oh wow
A	there's a massive difference between us half brother obviously but erm yeah my mum was forty-seven when she had him
D	wow okay
A	I only had one full sibling and now I have a half sibling as well bit strange yeah five years old bit weird when you're like twenty-eight and you've got a brother that's five
D	yeah
A	I don't really know what to do with it
D	I was trying yeah so yeah cos
A	yeah
A	that's a pretty big age difference still
D	yeah that's that's like normally that's about the biggest that I've heard of actually
D	yeah no that's what I was just thinking actually I was just thinking I wonder I mean that's I definitely like with
A	yeah
D	I'd gone off to university
A	yeah
D	so I didn't see him as you know
A	so you drifted a little bit
D	yeah I think so whereas obviously when I
A	yeah are you close with your your brothers now?
D	yeah yeah like we see each other quite a lot actually erm
A	that's good
D	so that's quite good but it's
A	yeah
D	cos everyone moves around so although both my brothers are relatively
A	yeah I I know
D	yeah
A	I'm from
D	oh okay
A	I know I know that area
D	erm and then the other one is in basically in
A	yeah
D	and it's like the same it was the same weekend
A	coincidence yeah that's fortunate
D	erm so I saw quite a lot of
A	my brother my proper brother is erm going to uni at the same time that we are as well but he's going to
D	well also probably again is like you just go into London and then
A	yeah that's the problem isn't it? it's sixty miles as the the crow flies but you have to go up to London and then back
A	yeah yeah and high expense
D	okay
A	and it was gonna cost about forty pound for a day return and it was still gonna take three hours to do sixty miles so an average speed of twenty miles an hour on the train I mean we're talking third world speeds here at that point you know what I mean? twenty miles an hour
A	it was terrible
D	that's painful
A	it really is it really is
D	er peppermint
A	peppermint
D	well I don't really which is why I asked for er
A	fruit tea
D	either the fruit tea or the herbals
A	yeah
D	I don't drink I do sometimes like when I'm at a conference
A	yeah
D	I do drink erm
A	it's part of the
D	well it is it's weird you just feel you feel really strange if you go to a conference and everyone's standing around with a cup of coffee
A	and you're not
D	ah it's hot
C	it reminds me so much of the fact that
B	yeah
B	maintained
C	landlords kinda give this stuff like
B	it's within a landlord's interest to maintain a property
C	that's fine
B	she didn't like those and she didn't
B	oh no no this is peppermint
C	oh is it?
C	is that just cos of where you like?
B	think I've lost the card you gave me
D	erm
B	ah there it is
D	yeah so you just I just start drinking tea and I'm like
B	you don't drink tea you don't do you
A	it's for the look no I don't drink it you didn't even pour me a water or anything
A	I'll get myself a water
B	alright then
A	do you wanna bring the table over so you can put it down?
B	yeah that's a good idea
A	I call it a table it's actually some kind of camping stool
B	ta da
C	thank you
A	no worries
B	he's very accommodating isn't he?
B	I haven't read the card yet thank you thank you for the card I assume it's
A	is my name on there?
B	I don't know actually not it's not actually so
C	I think it is on
B	ah it is on
A	oh we got shall we read it at the same time?
B	no it's okay
A	thank you very much
B	oh yeah there is one directly for you
B	thank you
C	it's okay
B	we went up to the campus the other day
A	yeah the campus was pretty but the buildings were ghastly
B	yeah yeah so
C	people quite like Sussex for the buildings
B	oh do they?
C	yeah I think they've got some er I can't remember the name of the architect
A	very contemporary kind of
B	not contemporary
A	some of it is that weird almost caracole spiral thing
B	mm maybe there's something hipster about it these days that we're missing I don't know?
A	it's meant to be quite a left wing university
B	mm yeah
C	when I was looking at universities
[ANNOTATION]	Sussex has very interesting buildings.	Entailment
B	they didn't do the course you wanted yeah
C	so I was like okay but I came to visit I went on an open day
B	ah
A	we originally wanted to go to
B	well cos we wanted to go back to
A	well we wanted to go back they combined a Delta with an MA in one year you could do them both together which was cost effective and got it kind of out the way but they stopped running that course
B	no
A	then we wanted to go to Edinburgh and then they put up the fees by two grand they were
B	yeah it was eight grand for the tuition
[ANNOTATION]	There is a university in Edinburgh.	Entailment
A	which as
B	no
D	I was trying to explain why I
D	well I I mean I didn't pay for
C	oh it wasn't
B	was yours a master's
C	an MPHIL
B	it was an MPHIL
A	MPHIL so that's a two years is it?
C	er no one it's er basically at Oxford and Cambridge if you do your BA you can
D	MA and BA means something completely different
[ANNOTATION]	MA is a synonym for BA.	Contradiction
C	means something else it basically means
D	MA just means you're over twenty-four
C	yeah
D	there's no
C	so you can go back and get your MA
A	it's like a mature
[ANNOTATION]	You can onlu do a MA if you're less than 24 years old.	Contradiction
B	oh really? oh
C	so it's actually so if you meet someone that says oh I've got an MA from Cambridge it's just a bachelors
B	oh
A	interesting
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker C knows a person who did a MA in Cambridge.	Neutral
C	erm so the masters are MPHILs and they do different kinds of MPHILs taught or research
B	yeah
C	and mine was taught
A	was a master's of philosophy an MPHIL?
B	okay and how much was that?
C	that was about four
B	yeah
A	it's definitely
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker C has two MPHILs.	Neutral
B	you had some additional costs though I remember you saying
C	yeah I had to pay I had to had to pay a college fee which I can't remember how much it was but yeah
A	that's what you were talking
C	it mostly my issues with going to
B	mm
C	so basically I had to show them how I was going to live because you're not allowed to work
B	okay
C	erm
A	you're not allowed to work?
D	no it's actually against college er statute
C	you need to ask
A	interesting
C	like you maybe you can get sort of like some work doing sort of tutoring or things like that but generally you would have to ask for special permission
D	you can't go and work at Sainsbury's
C	no you can't go and get a job in a Lush or whatever
A	just because the workload is too high then
B	oh yeah
C	because they because they want you to spend your time doing stuff that's enriching you in terms of
B	yeah
D	yeah so so you should be in plays in your spare time rather than
B	ah okay yeah
A	interesting of course you need to have the finances to support yourself though
C	yes so I had a career development loan
B	okay
C	which I took out and at some point it was fine but then towards the end of the year I actually did need erm not financial assistance but college I college had to be nicer to me and they gave me some money to sort myself sort myself out
B	yeah access to learning fund
A	so if you do start working what? Inland Revenue contacts the university?
C	no no basically basically
D	you can get thrown out of the university
C	that wouldn't happen though there's probably just
A	I mean how can you tell people you can't work?
B	is that the same for undergraduates as well?
C	it's probably more strict with undergraduates
D	it's it's very strict with undergraduates I actually know cos I was talking to one of the erm lecturers about this and I actually know they in Queen's they told someone that they had to stop work
A	wow
C	but but the reason for that the reason for that is because undergraduates like I at
B	yeah yeah
C	their blocks are eight weeks and I reckon
D	and they also have lectures on a Saturday
C	yes well it depends on your course it definitely seems a bit definitely like
D	so like scientists who do proper work
C	my friend my friend that worked there that did history said that she was having to write one essay every week
D	yeah
C	whereas I think I was writing maybe three a term
B	yeah yeah three a semester was the standard
D	no that's very that's actually quite cos that's what
C	I think maybe for one of his courses
D	for the first he turned up first like oh lectures I must go and then realised that basically no one goes to the lectures and they just
C	cos they spend their time in the library
D	they're just writing
D	yeah every every er week
B	every week
A	I couldn't have got through undergraduate without working I was working immediately
B	oh what a job? yeah yeah
A	three years yeah I was doing doing fifteen to twenty hours the whole three years
C	well yeah
B	yeah yeah yeah
C	and I'd come down to sort of say hey and then we met in
B	yeah yeah I do remember that
B	yeah that's not so bad
A	pleasant
B	I blend in quite well it's fine
C	just sitting outside in
B	just wondering what's going on
C	what's going on
B	that's not the only Lush you've worked at though is it?
C	no yeah when I was at sixth form I worked at
B	ah that's when you used to stink of Lush
C	yep
A	can you stink of Lush?
B	yeah really badly
C	you know how it smells when you walk past it on the high street? it's like that but ten times worse
A	is Lush sorry Lush is like one of these cosmetic shops bar soaps and er
B	yeah soaps and stuff
C	it was started by a guy called Mark Constantine who erm
D	it's
B	had good intentions
C	well he er
B	corporate
C	he was no actually they're still very political erm I'm not like their hugest fan because of some of the things they support and there's some contradictory things in their messages actually
C	but he was a he set up The Body Shop with Anita Roddick
A	okay
C	erm and then
A	about Lush
B	yeah
C	but it's kind of bad cos you know they kind of like they're very good on trying to source the best things where possible that they do use certain things like palm oil and things like that that you wouldn't necessarily expect them to
A	okay
B	yeah
C	so you could be depends on which but then you know comparatively to all the other crap
B	they're not that bad yeah
A	I guess abstinence altogether I keep trying to get you off every kind of makeup and soaps and whatnot
B	yeah
A	just rub baking soda in your hair and I'm sure you'll be fine
B	you can do that
A	course you can brush your teeth with
B	our friend
A	been wearing your turmeric masks
B	yeah make a turmeric mask it gives you a ginger beard though
A	she went out with a yellow face yesterday I said
C	turmeric's probably alright actually because it's not the stinkiest of
B	of things yeah it doesn't have a smell it's just very staining
A	I think it's an anti inflammatory as well
C	yeah it is really staining yeah and like if I've cooked with it I was you always kind of have yellow fingers don't you?
B	yeah yeah
A	it's really nice stuff though I love turmeric
B	yeah we've been cooking
A	ginger
B	do you guys like cooking? do you like cooking?
C	yeah
D	I like cooking
C	who cooks the most? you
B	yeah
D	by some by some way as well
B	I'm the sous chef though
A	next time you come up we'll cook we're not fully settled at the minute haven't got
C	yeah yeah definitely
B	he was like I don't I don't trust the oven yet so
A	I tell you what ingredients are different like coming back home I'm cooking the same things I was cooking in Korea but the ingredients are different yeah I need to get used to the ingredients here again cos it's all a little bit I need to tweak everything
B	things are actually hotter here surprisingly
A	yeah the chillies the chillies
C	hotter
B	are spicier yeah yeah that's
A	the rice the rice is different most of the basic ingredients are different courgettes in Korea are like this big they're like tiny you can't stuff a courgette in England they're like really small
B	there was
A	I don't know what you'd do with it? hey we did see some bigger ones than that one
B	yeah
D	ah you see so last year I grew courgettes I had quite
C	yeah they kinda turned we were like are these marrows or are they courgettes?
D	some really big ones are they are they now yeah yeah it was on it was on the level
B	courgettes bigger
C	yeah no it's our gardening went okay this year but I think because we were away maybe our tomato our tomato plants went crazy
D	had the best tomato plants this year and they died when we got back
C	they did so well
A	oh no
C	then they kind of outgrew where they were living
B	ah thrived too much yeah yeah
D	yeah I don't know? they fell over they fell over
C	but we had some excellent cucumbers and it looks like we've got some excellent cabbages
D	got yeah spring cabbage as well
B	wow you've got a proper patch
C	you know what you guys should
A	shall I get some cucumber out?
C	you guys should get
B	oh yeah we've got some
C	cos we've got we have one as well but we haven't we're not using it at the moment got this thing called erm an area garden which is erm
D	it's hydroponic
B	probably gonna leave that
C	it's really good for like herbs and
B	to get everything else done
C	oh look at this
D	oh thought that was that was quick
C	wow
A	just got it out of the garden not too bad
B	is it where do you do you
C	mm
B	in like a anywhere inside?
C	yeah you basically just have a over there or wherever
D	you er yeah you'll be alright here cos obviously you've got doors but erm
B	yeah
D	you have to it's obviously on light you know
B	yeah yeah
D	it has its own light at night it can be a bit
B	right
D	bright yeah
B	yeah
C	yeah no they're really really good
D	the only problem is is they do use up quite a lot of erm electricity
A	electricity
C	oh yeah I guess so
D	so the best ones I'm hoping someone will do it but they're erm basically you can get these LED ones now
B	mm oh that'd be much better
D	at the moment they're trying to work out the best and actually LED light is better for plants
B	ah
D	so they're at the moment try to work out what the best colour is erm
B	to get the most successful
D	to get the most success and there's this guy actually in Harvard who's growing like all these different plants and creating a database of all this stuff it's gonna be amazing like
B	ah awesome
D	when it when it gets finished erm
C	oh I love my late twenties talking about gardening
C	I love it
B	makes you feel older
C	I like being older
B	so how big is your garden? compared to if you're looking at this side? er yeah do you have any
C	I've got I think I've got
D	ah do you know what? I've probably got a picture cos I took some pictures of the tomatoes oh no I haven't got my phone on me though have I? oh
C	on my Facebook I think I took a picture of you in the garden
D	oh yeah when I was barbequing
C	yeah
D	that's a good photo
B	is that not a phone?
D	oh this is my old phone
A	that is old that nice touch screen five hundred pound phone that's old
D	super old
D	super old
C	is it the four?
D	and it's going it's the four it's not even the five
D	and I'm getting the six when it comes out
D	can't wait
B	is there a six?
D	yeah
A	yeah it's coming
A	apparently no different
D	oh it's gonna be loads different
A	my mum gave me this this is the first phone I've had in about eight years
C	you can drink it it's your champagne
A	I think it
B	should make er
B	mimosas
A	don't like being rung
D	you don't like being rung?
A	no not at all
B	oh yeah I saw this picture on Facebook I was like yeah
D	oh no yeah
B	it's cool
A	Facebook's nice you can leave me a message I can reply when I want to
C	yeah basically our garden is really nice
D	all our all our photos are on here
B	oh you've got some more
D	all the
B	it's nice all the trees they've really made that
A	let's have a look
B	private where's the? yeah I mean I take it there's more to it but
C	yeah so it's big enough it's big enough so that at the end we've got like where
C	his parents his parents his parents are kind of they close out their house and got rid of all their possessions they're just driving around in an RV or a motor home
A	oh wow
C	just travelling and enjoying their retirement
B	oh wicked around Europe or America? where are they?
D	both
C	America and England
B	yeah
B	wow
C	so we inherited their ping pong table so we've got a ping pong table
A	oh brilliant
C	and space for a barbeque and space for the cat to have a little
D	where is that picture from?
A	are you good at ping pong?
C	yeah okay
B	getting better
A	I quite like it it's a fun fun game
C	getting better
B	I haven't played ping pong since ah I mean we've played it on holiday a couple of times
A	yeah I like ping pong
D	is that
A	Koreans are amazing
D	that was last year wasn't it?
C	oh look he's reminiscing
D	I can't find a good photo unfortunately
C	they've got a few ping pong bars in London now but
A	ping pong bars?
C	yeah
D	yeah it's a big thing in London at the moment
A	delineate for me if you will what the hell are ping pong bars?
D	it's basically
C	it's basically a bar with ping pong tables
D	it's basically it's basically yeah ping pong tables because is because for everyone thinks that ping pong is cool so erm
C	there's loads of free ping pong tables everywhere as well at the moment
D	and actually I'm quite up for this like the idea of erm
C	having
D	having something to do without necessarily cos I think a lot of the time people like you know you meet someone you go what are you gonna do? oh probably go to the pub
A	mm
D	or something like that whereas actually you could go oh let's go play ping pong
C	yeah yeah
B	there are more activities than the pub
D	you don't need to as well
A	Korea are good for that
B	yeah
A	they have lots of DVD
B	there's lots of
A	you pay like eight pound to play golf for four hours
B	yeah
D	oh that's awesome
A	you hire the whole room out you can drink in there
B	yeah does that exist in England?
D	yeah
B	it does? is it expensive?
A	but it's not cheap
D	really expensive
B	cos it seems expensive in Korea by Korean standards but when you work it out it's
A	but it's not it's about eight pound each for like nine holes and when you're crap nine holes takes about four hours so
B	four hours but you can take your own beer in and everything
A	yeah they provide ice creams and whatever else the service is pretty good there
C	sounds good
A	so they have that in Korea they have like pool houses and
B	yeah it's good to go out and have more stuff to do than just
A	there's meant to be some music bars around somewhere I never saw one where they just have instruments out and you can just go in and pick
D	yeah that's
C	London definitely needs a bit more of that I think London's a bit still a bit too focused on just bars
D	maybe we should start a thing like that?
A	I think towns
B	run your own business
C	you can be our consultant cos you know how it's done
D	yeah you could just
A	I feel like town
D	we'll just pay you just to say things
B	we'll give you some freebies that would go on
A	town
C	it's true you've already got it right just start charging people five pounds to come in
B	not in my house
A	I don't know about you guys but when I go to a town centre there's like nothing to do I don't care about phone shops I don't care about WH Smiths and these kind of things
B	yeah you're gonna
A	I wish town centres were more interactive and were more like places you go in and you know make stuff and build stuff and get paid to go and do stuff
D	yeah exactly exactly
A	not just do you wanna buy this? no not really
B	I hate high streets
C	well that's why high streets struggle
B	most high streets anyway
A	we're pretty frugal so
B	a Primark Marks and Spencer's has to get shut down cos you know people aren't shopping there
C	yeah it's a really bad Marks and Spencer's anyway erm
B	I think it's gone
C	no I had some colleagues who had to go down to the
B	oh yeah
B	okay yeah yeah yeah
C	and instead they were like oh no we'll go into the centre of
B	oh no no no
C	and they ended up eating at the weird café at the top of Alders
B	yeah yeah
C	and said it was disgusting
B	ah yeah
C	I was like well
D	I told you
C	I told you don't go to
B	yeah yeah
A	oh
C	don't go don't don't go to Alders don't go to Alders
B	no no
A	don't don't don't go to Subway either
B	anyone
C	yeah but that's what I'm trying to say Subway is probably your best option
A	it's safer yeah?
B	it's it's your safest bet in
A	I wonder well
B	the Chinese is
A	there's got to be lots of good little sandwich shops around haven't there? it's England
B	not really in
A	full of little sandwich shops delis no not not in
B	some more cafés but they're all
A	just greasy spoons
B	yeah
A	have you ever been to
C	yeah yeah
A	did you like it?
C	no no I was on I was on the X five from Cambridge to Oxford
A	oh yeah I know it I know it well
C	and erm cos I needed to go to the museums there to look at stuff
A	so you went through er
C	so we went we went through
C	cos it wasn't snowing in
C	probably Oxford so the bus had to stop and said no we're not going any further
A	and the bus station there's horrible
C	yeah bus station and
A	did you meet mad
C	no no it was probably too cold in a snow start snow storm for mad
A	he'd be in somewhere yeah
C	in somewhere else erm
D	I've never heard this story before
C	so I had to get and then I just had to wait
D	I thought I knew all your stories
B	ah that was your encounter
C	so that was my one time in
A	well you didn't get stabbed so not too bad
B	we were erm when we were looking to rent somewhere here well first of all we came across a scam like if you'd noticed it
C	oh on Gumtree or whatever
A	yeah loads of scam apartments
D	it's weird
B	under different names but you can tell the language is all kind of similar we we like hit a few of them at the same time and got back very similar emails with the same
A	really hopeful like oh that's a
B	like very
C	were they asking you to pay money to view and things like that or anything?
B	well they jumped on that fact
A	we hadn't got that far
B	that we were abroad so we were trying to discuss how we could secure an apartment with them could we arrange a viewing? and they were quick quick to come back going oh no just send me this amount of money and you can secure it and they gave a long spiel about them being Christian and how you know
A	all sorts of
B	they want you to keep a godly home and keep it clean for them but erm you ran her name through the database
A	yeah I searched her
B	Mrs whatever
A	email addresses and were like mm scam
B	it's a scam scam
A	but I mean how can this same email address have been scamming people on Gumtree for years? but it's still happening I don't know?
D	er no so I was reading about this apparently what they're doing in and the reason it's broken English apparently they can also speak English very very well these people
B	mm
A	mm
D	they're trying to get someone gullible enough to fall for it because they're only interested in people that are gonna give them the money
B	give them the cash yeah
A	oh yeah absolutely
D	it's a filtering mechanism of of basically working out who's stupid
B	oh who is gonna be
D	who isn't picking up all these obvious signs
B	signs yeah
D	so then then they have to spend time emailing
A	I just don't understand how it's a known scam yet Gumtree doesn't take it down?
D	oh so I emailed Gumtree about one of them
A	yeah
D	when er I found out about it but yeah they don't they just
C	cos yeah when we
D	there's just too many of them
C	when we
D	that was actually one of the ones in
C	oh right was it?
B	no yeah
A	come and go like that
B	so these ones sort of looked reasonable but of course they were all fake
D	but I was gonna say that I imagine that
A	yeah
D	in a sense
C	you need to have your deposit cheque with you
D	you had to sort of go right I'll take it
B	yeah yeah you've got
A	yeah yeah I read an article that said
B	for getting properties and trying to get a property
A	and it was really stressful for us
B	it was stressful from abroad cos you'd see it come up that day and we were on a we were on the opposite time zone so when they opened we'd finished work like like that nine hour difference was really annoying
A	mm then they have the stipulation that you you must see it somebody has to see it so we have to get
B	someone has to
C	oh right so your parents had to come and
A	they saw this one just one
B	yeah
C	and your mum said it's fine
B	it's fine yeah yeah
A	then we had the bullshit I honestly thought we'd saved you know like fifteen grand each or something I thought when we came home obviously most of that's gone now on tuition and rent and all that kind of stuff but I thought having that kind of money they'd just turn around and be like yeah we'll take you great I I can pay the whole year up front no worries all this kind of stuff no not at all it was actually a hell of a lot of rigmarole
B	yeah we had to pay for an external company to
A	to reference us which was really difficult to do
D	oh
B	and we had to deal with them directly
C	I wonder
B	our agency just gave us their details
A	so they're telling can you send us bills? I don't pay bills well what's your
C	it's because you've just moved back isn't it? yeah
B	well we were doing this from
A	well we were still in Korea
B	Korea
A	so we had to get our bosses who don't speak amazing English to fill out all this paperwork saying that yes we do live here yes they do pay our bills and they pay all this it was really stressful
B	it was annoying because
A	they wanted like bank statements we don't get bank statements we don't have them
B	it was stupid
D	ah see when we we moved into the London one as soon as we paid six months in advance because I didn't have a job
A	yeah
D	and I knew that we wouldn't pass the credit check
C	actually yeah that was
D	because I didn't have I had enough money to pay it's like you basically I could have paid a year in advance so I just said look if I pay six months in advance
C	is that fine?
D	is that fine?
C	cos it's a six month contract anyway isn't it?
D	and they didn't and they didn't
B	yeah that's exactly what we said isn't it?
A	but we were telling them that I said I'll pay you six months I'll pay a year and she basically said that
B	I think it's because we were abroad
A	yeah I think so they didn't trust us yeah they wanted to make sure we were legitimate
B	regardless of whether we transfer them the money or not but that
A	now we've still paid them six months up front because actually we failed the reference check which really stressed us out cos it took two weeks of every day emailing contacting ringing trying to get paperwork I finally get it alright and then something's wrong with it so I have to do something it was really laborious and then erm yeah they just tell us they failed us so now we have to get guarantors and and we're worried about
D	ah
A	so I had to I mean they could have just told me
B	they had bank statements dating back for six months they just had to look at the other statements
A	they just didn't look there so I had to appeal that and that took another week
C	anyway you're here now
D	oh my god
B	yeah yeah
C	well now that you're here it's fine
A	yeah
B	yeah it's good
A	oh
D	that sounds absolutely ridiculous
A	it was a pain in the arse
B	it was it was silly it was just lots of silliness
A	I went in the library the other day I thought they were gonna credit check me just to rent out a book it's ridiculous
unknown_female	I know libraries
A	they told me I went in on my own I wanted to
B	which library?
A	print something
B	oh in Bedford?
A	they said do you have a library card? I said no I don't my mum does no no you can't do it I was like can I do it on my mum's? no no you can't do it on your mum's she can do it if it's for her but if it's something for you she can't do it for you you have to get your own library card
D	yeah I I need I've forgotten something like ages ago in Cambridge when I was like ah no I need to print this off and I was like oh go into library and I you have to it's ridiculous right it's just like all I wanna do I'm never gonna come back here I promise you
A	I just want to
D	print that's it and but she was really nice and she was just like I'm really sorry but this is what you have to do
A	yeah
B	oh
A	she recognised me I kind of you know vaguely thought I recognised her but she recognised me
B	and she still didn't let you do it
A	no I still well I got my mum to come in
A	she did it on her card
A	basically I told her look I haven't lived in the country for six years I'm not actually gonna live here so what sign up for this library card sir
A	one of many
B	ah yeah wanna have a library card
C	there is definitely I think erm cos you know how Boots if you bring your memory stick in you can just print off the photos that are on it
A	yeah
C	there's definitely a vending machine that should be like that for printing
A	some of those
C	like last minute emergency printing
B	yeah yeah
D	see this is the second business idea we've had today
C	I guess you've got like mailboxes in Korea don't you?
B	mailboxes
A	mm?
C	you know mailboxes I think that's what they do don't they?
D	oh do they?
C	like if you gave them your USB and they'd say okay that'll be one pound please or something
A	personally I think we have the capacity to become almost completely paperless at the minute I don't think we even need to print anything if people just accepted things more by email a lot
C	my library hurdles were encounters at the British Library because you need to have erm hard copies of your things that prove you are who you are
A	mm
C	so obviously had my pass had my provisional driving licence but then it was stuff like the bank statements and stuff and my employer doesn't have my address and so I had to try and prove my address and I haven't really had to do that
C	so I had to go away and wait until Natwest could send me some hard copy bank statements cos you're not allowed to print off online versions
B	yeah yeah it doesn't count
C	so I was like
D	yeah that's the that it really I think it's a real big problem actually because
B	yeah cos everyone's going paperless
D	all our electricity you know cos obviously look yeah I don't need to see the bill
A	no
D	like in in my hand I can
D	and then they're like well and then they're like well do you have a utility bill? and I'm like yeah it's online I can show it to you but
A	why?
D	well I could just go to a printer probably print it on decent quality paper and how can you tell that it's not come from the utility?
A	no
B	yeah they're just making you jump through a stupid hoop
C	yeah that
A	we have some serious hoops when we go to teach abroad they make us like all of our degrees have to be apostilled and all this kind of stuff our certificates we have to
B	sent us because people do
A	criminal record checks get them apostilled but it's bullshit though because you go to a solicitor's a solicitor signs saying this is a real copy of something that they haven't seen they never ring up the union to verify it they just sign yes it is a copy of whatever he just showed me and then you have to take that to somewhere in Milton Keynes to be apostilled yes he's a real solicitor that really did sign so basically it's just some solicitor's signature for that means nothing
B	yeah five quid
A	but it costs us every time every time we go away and then transcripts have to be directly sent from the uni to wherever we're working you can't just
B	oh do they? oh
A	yeah we had to get them sent directly to
B	oh yeah
A	and it went out before we couldn't
B	and they have to be within the last six months
A	yeah
B	regardless of when we graduated
A	yeah cos your degree goes out of date doesn't it? so you have to
B	so we have to apply for them all the time
A	it costs us about three hundred quid in paperwork every time we wanna go away pretty much
C	that's rubbish
A	ridiculous
B	yeah whatever
A	it's fine
B	just smile
A	they pay us we enough so it's not too bad
A	our old fourteen fourteen grand a year
C	yeah
B	they're becoming more common we heard we heard about them through our American friends they saw something
A	we didn't believe them yeah
B	at like an expo thing on American news about Britain and
C	yeah
B	our state of poverty because of these er banks
C	oh erm
B	but I didn't think they were that common so I don't know if they're American media was getting a bit excited
C	yeah we have the
B	this sounds good
C	outside our Sainsbury's we have the
B	oh okay
A	you're not a food
D	no
C	so then they just ask for
D	thank god
C	food donations for when we come out
B	okay yeah you can just donate add it to your basket at one
C	but yeah I don't think there's been a drastic rise
B	no
A	no
C	that's always
A	it's just always been there yeah
B	it's just another alternative thing
A	do you remember when?
B	is it new?
A	we had a friend that worked a like a coffee shop or something he got sacked cos he gave an old sandwich away to a tramp or something
B	mm
A	yeah but their sandwich was out of date
D	I mean the ridiculous thing I used to have
C	is that a health and safety thing then?
B	yeah it's probably like Starbucks could then be liable for food like the tramp
A	is a tramp gonna sue? I mean
C	well yeah because he wants to get rich
D	yeah that's like the the way tramps get out of poverty
A	oh is it?
C	yeah
D	so they go round hoping that someone's gonna an out of date that's why they're that's why they're begging for food
A	tripping on cracks in the pavement calling up the council
B	yeah
D	do you know what? if they I bet there's probably someone out there that's doing it
A	a clever tramp
B	yeah
A	definitely
D	he
A	he won't be a tramp for long
B	yeah yeah he's not a tramp
D	he's not a tramp he's just a pretend tramp
C	no but there was the whole thing in London about erm
B	getting a bit politically incorrect
C	this this this guy in I think it was in Fulham or somewhere that had like a really nice house that was pretending to be a tramp
C	and he was making a lot of money
D	yeah he was
B	just just like begging
D	the
B	oh yeah
D	on the underground
C	yeah they're fine
D	they're one of them's a millionaire
C	really?
D	yeah
A	what? you'd think at that point you'd stop do you know what I mean?
D	I mean he's a millionaire because the house he bought
A	oh he has equity
C	oh right that's kinda different
D	he's not actually got well it's not
C	but he still
D	if he sold his house
C	however he still owns his house that's pretty wealthy
D	yeah
A	I mean yeah if he's got a million whether or not it's tied up I don't care
B	how long is your mortgage for? like how
D	thirty years
C	until we die
B	thirty years ah makes
A	well you've done you've done the first of the three Ms
B	but obviously you remortgage and you move
A	you've got mortgage marriage is coming and then there's just maternity after
D	oh
D	I was gonna I was trying to work out how
B	it's murder
C	it's murder
A	that's the fourth and final M
[ANNOTATION]	one of the four m's stands for mother	Contradiction
C	yep
B	mm I remember you saying last time you were here
A	he sounds so sure
B	that was quick on
C	we've we've decided like one I think
D	yeah definitely don't want siblings
C	they're expensive
D	yeah like
C	going on holiday with
[ANNOTATION]	speaker c and speaker d are together	Entailment
A	they definitely fight
C	but
A	to the extent that they
C	yeah to the extent that they can be really really mean
B	ah
C	but that's like
B	was
[ANNOTATION]	siblings never get into arguments	Contradiction
C	they wind each other up
B	yeah yeah
A	we've thought about adopting haven't we?
B	how old is
C	ten
B	ah really? does she look a lot like
D	I don't think she looks like
B	yeah yeah
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	they haven't considered adoption	Contradiction
B	a younger
C	twelve
B	twelve
C	going to year eight
B	yeah does he like
C	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	she is fifteen	Contradiction
B	he does?
C	yeah I think so
A	and school's compulsory now until eighteen isn't it?
C	yeah he says they've erm mm we he's
D	is that true?
C	it's quite a big school isn't it?
A	I don't know you've lived here longer than I
D	don't tell me stuff I don't know
A	that's what that's what I heard yeah
C	well it's obviously chapter in
A	it's compulsory until eighteen
C	erm I think
D	that can't be right
A	apparently so
D	though
A	apparently there were like colleges are the country got a lot more people now like I have friends that have been kind of kind of through the back door into colleges because apparently there's been a rise I think it's this year or last year got a lot more people coming
D	but that whole erm what do you call it when you do er apprentices?
A	yeah okay baccalaureate sort of thing
D	I wonder whether they they're just trying to now do it so you can maybe you can stay like you don't have to stay in school or join an official apprentice programme
A	yeah perhaps there's one or the other but you have to do something personally I don't see a problem with finishing school maybe maybe eighteen I don't think you should go to university immediately
D	no no
A	I think you shouldn't be able to go to uni at least until you're twenty-one I think that's it's too big a debt to hand people obviously some people their parents pay for it or they get bursaries and grants that kind of stuff but for the majority of people to
D	ah I mean I think it's I the biggest problem is the raising of fees which is just a big mistake
A	yeah it really is going the American style as opposed to European style I mean we we really wanted to study in erm one of our major choices was the University of
D	the Netherlands yeah yeah
A	top hundred world university teaches in English does the course we wanna do tuition fees a thousand pounds a year not six thousand pounds a year cost of living equitable slightly less maybe couldn't do it I applied to numerous jobs around the
D	hopefully yeah the Netherlands is like the best non native speaking English people I think
A	you think it would be allowed wouldn't you?
D	yeah
A	I think for if we do a PhD we'd like to try and do it in the States or in Canada erm they seem to have a little bit more funding out there
D	oh oh I will say
A	you can get it
D	you can do teaching during your PhD
A	yes
D	as well
A	as an adjust professor yeah erm
D	that's yeah that's a good idea
A	ideally I'd like to live in Argentina but I don't think they're gonna
D	well I know like the one I know is mostly Singapore
A	yes
D	and that school right level is more than I mean I know the university's meant to be reasonable but
A	I mean Korean's I'm not gonna lie like at you know middle school they're doing some pretty complicated mathematical equations that we would still be doing with a calculator at like probably lower university maybe even up I I don't know I still
D	well there's I mean we so there was a thing that came out actually in the news about how England there's a table of education
A	oh just recently we're like eleventh or something?
D	yeah yeah we were quite low down like we dropped a place or two I think?
A	Finland first
D	yeah
A	they work less hours they have less homework they go to school when they're older
D	oh no I know I always say to people I could get anyone an A star in mathematics
A	yeah
D	easily
A	I'm sure you could
D	one one on one tutoring
A	we're all human right we have the capacity to understand these
D	also it's not that hard
A	most people just shy away from it because it has you know a reputation for being like that I'm not gonna like I'm not particularly mathematically inclined but when I did maths at school I did fine in it it wasn't a problem I just found it boring it
D	it is erm for the it is boring
A	it's not applicable there's no what do you do with it? you're like well I can do some basic division yeah and some basic adding but what do I need the rest for?
D	well it's cos it's cool
A	just yeah it's cool to have it
D	no but it
A	no okay
D	and they don't teach you like everyone knows Pythagoras' theorem but they don't really understand why it's ridiculous erm how it was has been known for like a really long time
A	yeah
D	and that sort of gets your interest and thinking like so this
A	obviously
D	the deeper meaning of mathematics rather than just oh I need to know the A square plus B square equals C square
A	just to pass it
D	to come and pass the test
A	yeah yeah we just need a complete revamp of how I mean maybe teachers are better nowadays than they were when we were in school but I certainly know that how
D	mm well I mean I know I know a lot of people at
A	mm
D	whereas now it seems like they're trying to break the
A	very restrictive learning
D	yeah they're trying to all these
A	yeah no of course yeah
D	it doesn't
A	mm
D	so they're now doing another way of dividing big numbers
A	ah interesting
D	not the standard long division where you you know you start
A	is it more efficient?
D	it's meant to be a lot more efficient but
A	progress
D	it's incredibly complicated
A	oh okay
D	to try and get your head it doesn't seem logical I think
A	well minimalism is an important thing for learners
D	but but that's what I mean is is that the simplest one is the quickest the quickest is not always the simplest
A	no not necessarily
D	yeah it's interesting
B	oh wow
C	and I'd like school if or even sport cos I actually quite like sport now
B	yeah yeah no
C	it was disgusting it wasn't just the fact
B	yeah
C	the really bad changing facilities like really gross
B	I stopped
C	and there wasn't anything to do it was like
B	yeah yeah
C	or
B	no we never got to play football
C	I remember we had like some shitty
B	yeah
C	I think best person to ask would probably be
B	yeah I know
B	where will
C	basically
B	okay
C	mum basically says that she thinks
B	yeah
C	she's not very focused
B	okay
C	it's not that she's not smart enough it's just

A	yeah I thought that'd be a brilliant idea
B	flashes light flashes red if it's upset but you can't actually hear and
A	hear it's completely soundproof completely safe you can push it down the stairs not a problem
C	I imagine it would be constantly red
D	I wonder why you thought of that?
D	anything to do with the
B	yeah yeah it is really noisy
A	it's really noisy
B	you're alright in the front though
A	and it's sash windows as well so it doesn't really

C	three years
D	yeah less than us weren't they? cos they got together I remember them getting together cos you were like oh I think
C	an actual proper one
D	yeah
C	as opposed to just a guy
D	yeah cos ah then she came to
A	quite a few guys passed her
B	is that an expression? to pass through
A	I don't think so
C	I didn't like that
A	no
C	at least
B	did they meet you guys met at
C	yeah I don't think I could meet
D	oh yeah
C	anyone on the internet
B	it's the most common thing
D	my

B	yeah
C	yeah
B	and was like just was like wait a minute I've just gotta say something to my mum or something and she had to like drive him around

C	yeah yeah that's the guy
B	was that the guy? yeah she had another weird one in in between him and the current guy
A	sometimes you hit it lucky
B	yeah yeah
A	our friend
C	sounds brilliant
D	I'm gonna get online
C	get online what are you looking for?
D	a boat
C	does would you go for a man with a boat if the boat came with it?
D	ah that's always a question I've had in my head that I haven't worked out the answer to yet
A	can you sail?
D	no
C	you went
B	so you might need a man with a boat then?
C	I would I would I would learn to sail very quickly if I had a boat
A	this is pretty impressive we have a friend that we met in erm
B	San Francisco
A	did up this boat bought a crappy boat did it up sailed all the way down the coast of America to we just missed them in EL Salvador so we were kind of in the same area they then sailed from Central America to New Zealand
C	wow
B	on this boat they did up themselves
A	across the Pacific took them months
B	it was a big boat
A	stopping off in tiny little islands
B	they're crazy
A	they've now just set off from New Zealand again back over the Pacific and they stayed in New Zealand for like a year year and a half or something just chilling just like whatever can you imagine sailing across the Pacific?
D	how do you how do you do that though in terms of visas though?
B	oh I don't know?
A	yeah I don't know? I don't know they did a lot of preparation they've kept being keeping blogs like follow them as they go and all this kind of thing
B	preparation they spent a couple of years in the States preparing for it
A	yeah
B	to do stuff like that
A	all this kind of stuff they took it pretty seriously but I mean it's amazing isn't it?
D	that's awesome
A	to sail across the Pacific stopping off at random Polynesia Micronesia or wherever
B	I wouldn't be able to do it though I don't like the sea that enough to do that to set sail on it in anything that wasn't wasn't controlled
A	you're not amazing with open water are you
B	no I'd be on a life jacket all day
C	we've got we've got quite a few boaty friends but that's because of the private schoolyness isn't it?
D	yeah
A	the rah
B	yeah
A	my brother said that about going to erm Bath he's going to Canterbury I just told er
B	he wasn't comfortable
A	that's fair it's quite rary especially in Bath
B	they didn't speak to us that's why
A	yeah probably
B	they knew we were from
A	from Bath oh come on the two unis never did the same subjects you might as well just make one big uni I don't
B	that would have been great for us
A	Bath Spa would be the sister college of arts or whatever
B	you just say I went to uni in Bath
A	yeah we just say that
B	don't have to be specific
A	it's not good when you're working
B	I've got some great aunt and uncle somewhere that think I went to Bath university
A	it's terrible when you're living abroad though cos they don't really know the uni so they're like you you went to university at a bath?
B	a bath
A	a bath a spa a spa a bath?
B	was it spa and university?
A	and now probably
A	sex
B	no
D	I did not know that
B	well there you go
A	never heard of it seventieth in the country
A	half way
D	used to play hockey at the uni er occasionally
B	in
D	mm
A	it's actually really pretty like the campus is really nice and it only has about five thousand students so it literally can't be any higher in the in the rankings I don't think? it doesn't have enough facilities it doesn't have enough funding
D	where where is it in
A	on the way to
B	it's on
A	really nice you can't like it's all conservation and listed you can't like build anything on it or anything
B	prince of Wales owns it or something
A	it's really pretty but
C	did you know about the Georgian swimming pool that's in Bath?
A	no
C	it's one of the oldest outdoor swimming pools in the UK and the heritage lottery fund has just given it a grant to do itself up cos it's all grow grown over and everything
B	no yeah
[ANNOTATION]	The Georgian swimming pool is 150 years old.	Neutral
C	cos it went out of use in the seventies
B	oh that's why yeah we would have heard of
A	do you know we have the oldest cinema in
B	where abouts is it do you know in Bath?
C	it's erm I'm not sure exactly where but I thought
B	I wonder where it'd be?
A	have you heard that? the oldest cinema is in
C	yeah erm I'm
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A said they had the oldest stadium.	Contradiction
D	you'll
C	yeah again we have this programme at work which is called young roots which is where young people have to drive the heritage projects so they've gotta be erm sixteen to twenty-five and they've got to choose their heritage topic and then work with a partner organisation
A	mm
C	so they're working with erm the partner organisation is a charity based in
C	so it may come your way soon but essentially they're going around and then researching the erm cinema the theatre the pier
A	oh brilliant
C	cinema history and they're gonna do walking tours and audio posts erm in the city
B	oh yeah
C	so you'll be able to hear stories about
[ANNOTATION]	Each story lasts 10 minutes.	Neutral
B	mm
A	sounds good
C	yeah yeah I mean it's it's gonna be alright
A	colourful's a good way of putting it
C	not quite sure how high quality it's will be it's more about just kind of getting people to kind of
B	interact or
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker C is uncertain concerning the quality of the experience.	Entailment
A	the quality's okay sixteen to twenty-five
C	skills cos they're gonna and it's not just like heritage and research skills
B	is that what you do at work
C	well they
D	they
C	that that programme is really undersubscribed so if we get a project where it's potentially good it's got an easier time of getting money than a lot of the other ones where it has to be a bit more substantial
D	so what you're saying is you need to find if you wanna get money for heritage find
C	find a group of kids
D	find find a group of kids
C	find a group of kids and er get to tell them what they've got to do
[ANNOTATION]	The government usually supports heritage projects.	Neutral
B	to support stuff yeah
A	what is it you do exactly?
C	I'm a grants officer for one of the lottery distributors
A	brilliant
C	if you go to a museum a park we even fund cemeteries and see the little lottery logo
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker C works in the office for the last five years.	Neutral
B	yeah yeah
C	and we've awarded some money there
A	okay do
C	er no that's the big lottery fund
A	okay that's separate
C	so I just do heritage and kind of arts kind of cultural stuff erm and then the big lottery fund does things like
B	so you're the cultural side of it
D	sport centres
C	sports and they also do things erm cos the whole point about lottery is it's not supposed to displace core services
A	okay
C	but say they also run health grants so rather than treatment centres what they'll do is they'll have therapy centres so for cancer sufferers they'll have like massage clinics and things like that which are just sort of
B	okay
C	bringing together kind of different groups of people to sort of
A	it's all positive
C	help share positive energy and therapy and stuff that you don't get on the NHS
A	see I don't really understand I don't know how much the winnings are nowadays on the lottery but let's say you win the jackpot just you it's five million
C	mm mm
A	how much of that then goes to this lottery funding?
C	erm so the prize money is a separate thing so the
D	the two pounds that you for your ticket
C	the two pounds that you pay for a ticket of that
A	it's two pound now?
B	yeah yeah it's two pound a line
A	what?
C	but you get entered into a raffle
A	it was a quid wasn't it?
D	yeah
B	yeah times change
C	you get you get you get entered into a raffle as well at the same time
A	yeah
B	yeah yeah you do
A	oh so you get a bonus yeah
B	you get entered into a raffle which you don't win
A	so effectively this is
D	which which is like harder to win than the main main prize draw
A	so you pay two pound on the ticket
B	and what percentage goes where?
C	twenty-five percent goes to the lottery fund distributors which includes Arts Council Heritage Lottery Fund big lottery fund Sports England
B	between all of those areas
A	so you don't have the option of just paying a pound fifty you have to pay for this tax or what effectively
B	that is quite a lot actually that's quite a lot of organise
A	it's a tax isn't it? they're just building a
B	I mean they were doing that with previous money anyway
A	I know but I always just found it weird where's this money coming from?
B	where's the rest of the money going?
A	surely the winner is thinking hang on a minute that's my winnings
B	the other seventy-five percent
A	you know what I mean I won
B	okay
A	it's just a stupid tax
B	Lancelot
C	I mean
B	Gwenevere or whatever their names are
A	isn't that
D	Camelot
A	Matilda no what am I thinking of?
B	Robin Hood
A	Robot Wars that's it
B	oh right yeah
C	but yeah it's I mean yeah people have obviously yeah
B	Matilda
D	I'm so annoyed that went off cos I would totally have built a robot
A	yeah if you were just a bit older when it was on yeah
B	what and to compete with it yeah you did get competing er colleges on there didn't you as well?
C	yeah you did
A	I used to love Robot Wars I think that was great I think the last time I watched it they made it crazy like some really big one it was like
D	a juggernaut
A	I don't know I
D	I can't remember what the really scary one was meant to be called as well like it just only came on occasionally
A	yeah
D	and it had like it was this humungous it wasn't very good though
D	and I thought
A	too slow
C	I can only remember
D	it go
B	yeah
C	or no no no sergeant Bash
A	sergeant something or other
D	sergeant Bash yeah
B	just did that was that one?
C	they all did that that and they
B	oh did they?
C	no and then they brought the saws out do you remember the saws?
B	oh yeah
A	and it was done by that
B	the flame thrower
C	the flame thrower
D	the flame thrower yeah no that was the big one
B	maybe that's what I'm thinking of
A	oh yeah yeah yeah wasn't it hosted by that crack head from Red Dwarf?
C	Craig Charles
B	yeah yeah yeah
D	Craig Charles
C	Craig Charles who is a successful funk and soul DJ on Radio Six Music and various club nights
A	he was a crack head wasn't he?
C	yeah he's actually quite a good DJ yeah
B	oh really?
A	yeah
D	he's actually quite a good DJ
B	is he still on Coronation Street?
A	is he still on crack? I think
C	doesn't matter if he's a DJ
C	if he's a children orientated TV presenter then may not
A	that's a problem yeah
B	yeah that's the danger zone in general these days isn't it?
C	which is why he's probably like yeah you know what? I'm gonna keep my habits to myself but be a successful DJ much more sensible
A	so the moral of the story is crack's alright just don't be around children
C	just don't do it to
B	and babies
D	I think that's a good moral
A	yeah
B	yeah I think so
A	well we need children free parks then don't we? can go and smoke our crack our crack in it without worrying about children
C	adult parks yeah adult delinquent parks
A	yeah definitely
C	that's no cos that would attract things like dogging surely?
A	well we can have
D	you know what we
A	we can have specific specific dogging parks
B	see where your mind goes
B	just trying to think of the worst things possible
D	I didn't tell you this but when I was going home to
C	no don't tell me about dogging in
B	oh oh
D	I was coming over
C	no it's not
D	it's probably drug dealing I would
B	no
D	it's not so close enough so it's probably yeah
A	dogging is when you watch other people right?
D	yeah
A	you park up in cars and then you just
D	you have sex in the car but then then you
A	voyeurist
D	let people like look
unknown_female	have a little look have a look
D	so you can either be I don't know which where
A	why don't you just film it and put it online? I don't really
C	they probably like that
D	no cos it's like yeah I guess you get
A	it's live
D	it's live rather than being
C	cos some people wear masks don't they?
A	I saw that in
B	oh do they? I don't know
C	there was an article about it in like the Guardian or something where one of the journalists went and basically went to a dogging thing
B	oh yeah
A	why not?
B	just to see what was happening
C	yeah
B	get first
A	old
C	lonely Thursday
B	is that the name of the article?
D	although have you been reading about this have you been reading about the celebrity nude leaks?
C	no I have not
D	so apparently the the security people went on apparently there's a forum of people just trading
C	naked pics
D	all of these naked pictures and they're not just celebrities apparently
[ANNOTATION]	there are nude photos online	Entailment
B	ah ah
C	well
A	you could be on there
B	well there we go
C	do you know like
B	changed in front of a window
C	again naked pictures I don't know?
A	no
C	I don't think that's
[ANNOTATION]	celebrity nude photos are online	Entailment
D	that you know of
C	that I know of
A	yeah
D	you know that teddy I gave you?
A	we thought we were in a porno once it was horrible
A	do you remember?
A	we were sitting on a nudist beach in Mexico like on the coast somewhere and like
B	though the only people that were nude of course were the old fat guys
A	old fat horrible men but we had a balcony but the balcony had these big black walls on it which seemed a bit dodge so and you had palm trees in front of you so you could stand naked on your balcony and no one on the beach could really see you it wasn't really a problem but we were lying on the bed one day and noticed this big mirror right in front of the bed
[ANNOTATION]	people could see us nude	Contradiction
A	and nobody was coming out of that there was one more room next to us this was the furthest corner room and they put us specifically next to it even though there was no one else staying at this whole establishment and the longer we were there the more we were starting to think that there's somebody filming us behind this
B	it was hollow and you could
A	yeah it wasn't right there was something wrong
B	I don't know if it was the other the bathroom was on the other side of the other room but
A	yeah I don't know? it just seemed dodge it was a very big mirror
D	too big
A	yeah yeah just looked like
B	I'm sure it was fine
A	course it was only after that we thought about it
C	oh well
[ANNOTATION]	the mirror was suspicious	Entailment
A	oh well we might be in a
B	I always thought Korea would be a good place for that just there's so many motels that you stay in that are so cheap but a little bit seedy
A	yeah definitely to film well I mean we've seen some Korean porn and it's like foreign women on it and you're like some western blonde haired woman on it I start getting a bit paranoid staying at these love motels and stuff
B	mm
C	it is a
D	I'm not gonna go into every hotel and measure the size of the mirrors
B	we did do you remember that?
[ANNOTATION]	there are many motels in Korea	Entailment
A	you do get really good quality in Korea I mean we would spend what twenty pound a night? its like ten pound each forty thousand wan
B	yeah
A	like twenty maybe twenty-five pound a night and you'll get massive you know you get your own fridge massive TV and you'll have an open like bathroom with all sometimes we've had like a stripper pole in our room
A	that was Guatemala
B	but you did you were sitting on the toilet and you looked up and there was a little sign about you and he's like this is not a camera this is like an LED light from
A	just like a tiny little camera
[ANNOTATION]	there was hidden camera in the room	Neutral
B	for when the power goes out or something but it obviously had er he'd obviously had people complain and ask him like
A	and it's right above the toilet and it does look just like a little camera
B	unless it was and that was just a cover up but er
A	it's a pretty good cover isn't it? this is point it out this isn't a camera
B	that's what that's what place you're
A	really?
A	lovely
B	struck a nerve did it?
C	oh dear
A	has he has he been trying to get you to do that for a while?
C	no
D	go in the toilet now
C	please
A	wait until your forties
B	sometimes we've had a couple of rooms where it's just a room and the toilet's in the room there's no there's no screen there's no walls
A	no curtain no anything you just you're just sitting facing
B	there's a shower and a toilet
C	the only thing we've kind of had like that was when we were in Copenhagen we were in the hotel where it was basically yeah it was a cordoned off area but the glass was like just totally see through
B	yeah yeah
A	and not soundproof
B	yeah yeah
C	er yeah it's just yeah but the thing is when you live with someone
A	exactly
B	it doesn't matter yeah you get over that pretty quickly
A	because you get used to each other's motions
B	do you? some people
D	oh god oh
D	god
B	I mean you've
C	well he doesn't go out he goes out when we're like
B	yeah yeah
C	cos we've got we
D	also he's not allowed out
A	you haven't declawed him or anything?
C	he squared he squared off to a fox the other day
D	well then the fox squared up to me when I was like
C	yeah trying to get rid of it
B	your cat's gonna get you in trouble with the neighbours
C	but he did that thing where cats cos he's got levels of aggression cos with other cats he's literally quite he's quite dominant and he'll chase them away
A	mm
C	but with this fox I've never seen him do it but it's where cats are aggressive but they're really intimidated and they puff their body up
B	yeah yeah
A	kind of putting their back up like yeah
C	and that's that's obviously cos he was quite scared by that
B	ah
C	but he's you know
C	well yeah the fox would kill him
A	yeah
B	did you have him in your last flat?
C	no
B	ah no so just since this one
C	no he's he's been with us since January
B	oh so really recent alright I didn't know about the cat then
A	we've got some resident spiders
B	we don't message each other enough to get the
C	I don't message anyone enough
B	neither do I I'm pretty bad I managed in these last two years I managed to skype
A	that's pretty good
B	cos the two years I was in Korea before that I didn't skype anyone apart from my parents
C	yeah I don't know yeah like Skype I don't really like skype I I've used skype for like we've used skype when we've been far away
D	yeah you yeah you really don't like skype
C	I get a bit like I don't like having just
D	doesn't even like when we skype I don't get to see
B	oh really? you just won't turn on the video?
A	you can use it just for the phone can't you?
B	yeah yeah yeah that's better
C	yeah
A	if you really want to
B	we've had some job interviews over skype
A	ah terrible
B	they're always horrible
D	oh yeah
A	having your job interview on skype
B	so awkward
A	especially when it's for the both of you
B	yeah
A	just really hard
A	yeah
B	I just remember I think I just started like leaning like trying to go off screen slightly
C	start running away
B	I couldn't really do that in a real job interview
A	the thing is they're not native speakers either so they don't really speak English that well so there's definitely a bit of a
B	but I was like we haven't got this job I need to get out yeah yeah that be awkward
A	yeah
B	the connection ah it's just
A	and they can go from one way like not grilling you at all just basically wanna see that you sound English especially on the entry level jobs they like really grill you
C	grill you and make sure
A	like really grilling you but that we didn't do very well on that one did we? we've been travelling for too long we weren't in work frame and they just suddenly started grilling us so tell us what kind of communicative activities you'd use for comparing and contrasting the present perfect continuous and the present perfect simple and you're like
C	I didn't learn about
B	it's actually really straightforward it's like in hindsight now
A	well the grammar's simple now we know it now
B	but
A	it's the problem with grammar it just gets deeper and deeper and deeper I don't seem to have found any end to it
B	I don't go that deep
A	talking a
A	a Powerpoint of about four hundred jargon words that just
B	we don't mind grammar school though do we?
C	no the only time I learnt any kind of grammar was really when I did a brief bout of Latin
B	yeah yeah you did do a brief bout of Latin
A	to learn languages you need to don't you? you know
C	ah cool
B	but I have to do it as part of one of my modules
C	which language are you gonna pick?
B	I was gonna do Spanish which is probably against
A	a cheat but
B	the point of why they're making me learn a language cos I already know some but I'd actually like formal lessons in it and to try and re cement all the stuff that we learnt whilst travelling but
A	we're doing completely different modules
B	they prefer you to choose something you haven't studied before yeah
C	fresh
B	no not everything there's quite a mixture actually there's obviously French and Italian and German there's Arabic there's Japanese
C	there's quite a mixture of like
A	do some Arabic we're off there next
B	yeah
C	I think Arabic would be quite useful
[ANNOTATION]	They should learn Arabic because they are going to Senegal next.	Neutral
A	as long as you'll be good with your
B	yeah that's true we are going off to yeah but I know it's gonna be horrible and I don't wanna do nothing I don't wanna do something
A	I mean elementary beginner Arabic should shouldn't be too bad
C	do you know any Arabic words?
A	I can write my name in Arabic but that's it
B	do you?
C	no
B	oh right you were saying it like you were gonna surprise me with something
A	it's like it's backwards isn't it? so
[ANNOTATION]	A can write their name in Arabic.	Entailment
B	so it means whenever we've been to
A	it's correct they're like yeah yeah
B	it's almost like a prayer book thing you can write in so there's numerous ones over the world now where
A	trying to imagine you speaking Arabic
B	might just still
A	you'd be better with Klingon I think it's very similar isn't Klingon and Arabic?
B	this
A	no you'll you'll be great at Arabic you'll be great
B	I love you too darling
[ANNOTATION]	B knows that they are going to choose Korean for their module.	Contradiction
D	isn't there the thing on Game of Thrones isn't that?
C	Dothraki
[ANNOTATION]	They speak another language in a TV show.	Entailment
A	Dothraki
D	Dothraki isn't that based on Arabic?
B	I think some of it is Arabic and
D	and and they actually have slipped in erm like geek jokes into it
A	yeah I did see an article on that
B	oh okay
A	you like Game of Thrones don't you? seen any
D	er I mean I watch it I don't know whether I can classify that I like it
B	that's fine
C	I've read the books
A	I was lame enough to read the books also
[ANNOTATION]	Both A and C have read the books of GOT.	Entailment
B	yeah yeah
A	all five thousand pages of them
C	they're really good for when you're commuting those cos you just whizz through them
A	did you find though that the first three how many are there? there are five? the first three
C	I get confused cos didn't they squish two of them together?
[ANNOTATION]	The author of the books took his life on December last year.	Neutral
A	that's the fourth and the fifth I think I didn't really like the fourth and the fifth the first three were I mean I'd seen the
C	the erm the issue with it is is that there are characters you like and there are characters where you like turn the page and you're like oh please don't
A	yeah ah no er it is yeah
C	cos you're like oh gotta read that
A	Bran
C	Bran Stark yeah erm yeah yeah so yeah I don't like the Bran Stark stuff
A	no no no
C	and I don't like particularly all of the stuff in Dawn
A	no no no
C	like
A	I've forgotten it so it didn't stick very well
C	yeah Dawn where yeah the
B	yeah
C	like it was just like he's added this whole other area and it's all fine and everyone's got their theories about why he's done that
B	there are a lot of theories yeah
A	there's the
C	yeah so you know what's gonna happen I don't know
A	no one's gonna care by the time it actually
C	I do care I just the thing is like cos the whole point of like when I read the first book it's kind of I knew that I was getting myself cos I only read them like last year
A	mm
C	I knew I was getting myself into a long slog and potentially a slog that will still not be finished until I'm like forty-five
A	yeah
B	yeah basically
C	or something
B	if he takes as long writing the next couple of books
A	ever heard of the Wheel of Time?
B	no
A	that's a series apparently it's similar along a similar vein but it's
C	I mean I'm not really in I'm not really in to fantasy
A	like fifteen books
B	no no no
C	too much if that's what you wanna call it
A	no I'm not either no I'm not
B	we're not either yeah
A	but my friend recommended this so I downloaded and it's like fifteen thousand word books each one and apparently they're thinking about making that into a TV series
B	words
A	thousand page books not thousand word
B	pages yeah
A	thousand page books
C	I was gonna say that sounds readable
B	yeah yeah that's fine
A	it's a novelette
B	that's just a Monday afternoon at the moment
A	what are you reading at the minute? anything good
D	I'm reading what is it called? that Donna
C	you're reading The Secret History
D	Secret History
A	no? and yourself
C	erm I was reading erm this thing which is talking about consumer attitudes towards food
A	oh
C	cos I'm trying to be a bit more on a health kick at the moment so if I read this on the commute I'm just like yeah supermarkets do totally do that to you to make you wanna buy shit
A	definitely yeah
A	all the lighting
C	so that's my motivation thing but on my way down here I was reading the guide to the British Film Institute's London Film Festival
B	oh yeah
C	which is starting in a few weeks
B	oh
C	so I was seeing what was on and turning over pages like oh that looks good
A	yeah
C	so
A	well let us know if there's anything good on
B	recommend that for a read
A	we're gonna be poor students now aren't we?
B	I'm not gonna have time to read things for fun I don't think
A	no I don't think so either
C	they probably do free film screenings and stuff in
A	would anyone like a glass of red wine? I think there's enough for like a glass each
C	would you like a glass of red wine?
B	what time is it?
D	three thirty
B	it's a reasonable time three thirty we'll have one glass and then we'll take a walk out to the beach
A	that's a reasonable enough time for a glass of red wine isn't it?
D	yeah I think so
C	cos
B	well we'll take
A	there's erm a
C	okay sounds very good
A	might finish at some point so screw cap lovely good quality
B	you're blaming me for getting a screw cap? I'm like screw cap's fine though
C	that that doesn't
D	actually officially it's the
B	it's better now isn't it?
D	yeah scientifically
B	that's what I told him
C	they're well
D	well I thought I'd made that up
D	so I
B	cos it doesn't always
A	do we actually have any wine glasses?
B	those weird things your mum well
D	I'm okay to have it out of a mug
C	cup no it's fine
A	no
B	no just give them a quick rinse
A	you know what I'm like with rinsing
B	doesn't like the sink area
A	no I don't like washing things
B	it repels him gotta wash something up
C	no get away
D	but no the thing on the bottom apparently
B	oh okay
D	erm so good wine should have sediment
B	oh
D	which is why you normally need to decant good wine
B	yeah ah there you go
D	that's what
B	is that cos it's just been bottled for longer or?
D	yeah so basically the
B	as well as what's in the bottom
D	yeah I don't know exactly why but the sediment is important for the wine
B	yeah
D	and so good wine has sediment which is why you need that bottle and then the idea is that it should all obviously it sinks to the bottom
B	yeah ah there you go
A	do you guys know anywhere good to eat?
B	I thought you'd know about your wine do you still order wine by the crate?
D	yeah we've skipped one this cos we're trying to
C	I just drink it I don't
D	but I'm gonna change I'm gonna change to a different wine club I think
B	distribute it
A	god are you in a wine club?
D	yeah it's the best it's the best way to cos I've I've had real er the
B	yeah
D	erm and I like trying new stuff even though I hate new
B	yeah yeah it's like you'll give it a go again just in case
B	where's your favourite wine which country do you prefer?
D	oh France
B	oh always France oh okay
D	it's only France yeah
B	oh really? only France
D	only France so
B	oh that's a statement
D	and only particular regions of France as well not even just so my favourite wine's from Burgundy
B	okay
D	and actually my favourite place in the world is a
B	you ever been?
D	yeah I've been several times
C	we're probably gonna go to France for like a camping trip cos we've got a new tent
D	cos we bought we bought a mega tent
B	oh wow
D	so
B	mega
D	yeah it's humungous
C	you can stand in it it's like
D	and it's got like a living area and I'm so excited
C	oh look at these thank you
A	yeah sorry they're a bit wet
B	yeah I like camping that sounds like comfortable camping
D	yeah that's the
C	cos it'll be it'll be really cheap cos it's be just sort of like
D	so yeah we stay
A	watch it now actually that's gonna drip on your skirt
B	oh yeah
D	like the erm
C	do you want is that?
A	I'll get some tissue actually
C	oh is there was it oh on the bottom of my foot?
A	yeah there was a little bit on the bottom
C	I thought
C	gone to get you a plastic beaker
A	she's getting there
C	but yeah no camping is really cheap obviously cos you just need to especially if there is more than two of you cos you just drive across and share the ferry bit don't you?
D	well and also in in the in France they
B	oh yeah
D	have really good municipal camping sites
B	camping sites
D	they're all the ones we stay at when we do the wine thing
B	and really well facilitated
C	yeah
D	really good
C	and lots of ping pong tables hopefully
D	you're not doing ping pong in my wine trip
B	is that what it's for? a wine trip
B	ah does the wine taste the best when you're actually there drinking that?
D	erm it well it's cheaper
B	oh which means it tastes better
D	yeah I mean it it's the same wines so it's
A	do you like Chilean wine much?
D	erm so yes the only other wine apart from France that I will drink is
C	well
D	no well yeah
B	yeah what you purchase
D	I would yeah if someone gave me a er
C	your purchase
A	er somewhere cheap
D	so I used to do blind wine tasting as well
B	oh tell us
D	but I can't
B	what do you think about this wine?
D	I can't do it now
B	it's cheap so
C	go on go on
D	no I can't do it now
A	it was reduced from eight pound to five pound so
B	tell me where and how much
D	so yeah I used to be able to tell you I could have told you before
B	ah sorry
D	but I haven't drunk a lot of erm
C	you like Malbec that's Argentinian isn't it?
D	that's Argentinian no but Chilean red so sorry yeah Chilean red is okay erm South African wine is surprising me at the moment
A	is good
B	yeah it does our friend
D	so that seems like it's getting better
A	my our friend loves it she swears by her
D	Georgia in the States?
A	no Georgia as in Georgia
B	Georgia like the country yeah
A	she spends her time
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about party	Contradiction
D	but erm so really weird so erm the Lebanon make a fantastic red wine
A	oh
D	erm it's called a erm er
A	I don't think you'd like Korean red wine
D	oh yeah
A	we did
D	my knowledge of Korean wine is er I just remembered
A	we went out for a meal didn't we? I think
[ANNOTATION]	they are not sure about meal	Neutral
D	yeah we went to
A	I think we went to an Italian restaurant or something
B	yeah
D	er what's it called? Vabiano
C	Vabiano
A	would anyone mind if I smoke out the window?
C	no
D	no
A	I can do it in the kitchen or are you joining me are you? I thought you didn't smoke?
C	whatever I smoke occasionally now
B	yeah we quit for a year completely and then when we changed jobs we got a bit complacent and we were drunk and we were kind of okay we smoked like maybe one or two cigarettes every couple of weeks or something at the weekend
[ANNOTATION]	person B is talking about cigarettes	Entailment
C	I'd be I'd murdered if I
D	no I wouldn't let
C	no cos we were at a house party a couple of years ago and I think I was just a bit tipsy I was just slipped back into my pre
C	and we had to leave
B	oh that's really angry
D	I don't wanna say too much about the the reason I
B	yeah
D	cos I don't wanna offend you at all but erm
A	no you can offend
[ANNOTATION]	they are not sure he is offend or not	Neutral
D	erm basically I know the er genetic side of things and what it does to you so
B	mm
D	I was erm
A	please go into detail you might help us to er quit
B	yeah we're trying to
D	well so essentially you can tell erm so if I take your blood
B	yeah
D	erm as long as you've had a cigarette in the last three months I can tell that you have and that's erm it's a little marker on your actual DNA that's changed
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	they are not sure how long cigarettes is in blood	Neutral
D	now you don't you don't want that to happen generally because you I mean it's not a good thing and so I think I do what really is gonna be found out hopefully in you know near future is exactly what the cause of that is and what it does
B	and what the implications of that is
D	and all the implications
B	what the what are people suggesting at the moment?
D	the no one knows the problem is what it so it's the area of research that I work on it was found this marker was found er was it fifteen years ago the
B	mm
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about one research	Entailment
D	well there's actually a case now where nature a lot of people believe that your environment is actually directly affecting your
B	DNA
D	DNA which is nature technically so it's not just erm you know when you're born you're pre programmed and everything you have would you know
A	no of course
B	mm
D	so things like weight seem to be associated with things you could the really interesting thing for what I'm gonna do in the future is to do with ageing so it seems that these markers are particularly relevant for ageing erm and actually we can now predict someone's age within about three years which is really really cool right
A	like rings in a tree
D	erm so that really shows you how powerful this stuff is
B	yeah
D	and of course what is really bizarre and
A	mm
D	erm you can make a cell last forever
A	don't coy carp I swear I read something a while ago about coy carp effectively they live forever if it wasn't they got too big for their environment and then their like lungs collapse
D	yeah so I don't know about coy carp there are certain other examples one of the interesting examples is naked mole rat
A	yeah
B	oh yeah
D	lives a very long time I think that's found in Argentina South America is its erm
A	I've heard of it
D	base erm
B	it's an ugly fucker
A	yeah
D	largest largest colony is at my university
B	oh really?
D	which is kind of weird erm but it doesn't get cancer at all so it lives er that's why everyone's really interested in it cos obviously the biggest cause of death erm once you hit a certain age is cancer erm so
A	and do you know if it's coming from the nicotine from the added chemicals?
D	no see that's another thing like so the smoking paper was released like three years ago and it's a really good paper because it's the one it's one of the first so before the it was before age well ageing was a bit similar time but
B	yeah
D	its been repeated like fifty times
A	yeah
D	so it's super believable but you know what what we don't know is
C	have they done it for alcohol as well?
D	so they've tried
B	yeah what is that?
D	there's some alcohol papers but no no not clear association which is
B	yeah yeah social
D	yeah so I think it's gonna be an interesting thing
C	also what about erm is it cos obviously you're talking about tobacco but what about if they've done it or tried sampling people that don't smoke tobacco but say for example chew it?
A	mm
D	no see that's
C	is it the smoking process of the or the actual
D	unfortunately I'd need a bunch of people who
C	some tobacco chewers that don't smoke
A	well go to the States yeah
B	just go to Tennessee
C	yeah
B	all of them
A	they're all chewing it out there
D	no
A	we know it's terrible for us is which is why we've been trying to quit for ages
B	that's why we did quit for a year and swore we'd never go back
A	and I'd say we're in a process of quitting now
D	but if
A	we know that we wanna stop but it's so difficult it's so ingrained and the reason that we started again was because we did a year we felt confident we felt comfortable we thought we've broken the habit now let's have one every so often that's not a problem you know? I'm sure if you just have a cigarette once every few weeks or a month I'm sure you'll be fine but then that catches up on you and then you're having a couple this weekend and then five the next weekend and then before you know it you've bought a pack because you've had a stressful week and it just catches back up with you again
C	well when I saw
B	oh is she?
A	I think they've gotta be worse for you with these unregulated vapour
C	yeah she I actually tried it I tried one puff of it cos I was like oh what is it?
B	that's amazing that
C	yeah
B	bless her she tried
C	she had she had this very glamorous obviously she had a glamorous looking one
B	yeah of course yeah
C	she used to smoke Sobranies didn't she? but erm
A	yeah yeah yeah they're all flavoured
B	flavoured did it taste like chemicals to you? cos when we tried one of our friend's in Korea
C	there's something about the sensation of actually smoking smoking and again from a rollie you don't get from a cigarette
B	yeah definitely
C	is that actually feels like it's something
A	mm
C	as opposed to cos sometimes if you're smoking
B	that's why I don't like cookers cos I don't like the
C	because you are taking in but then you can't actually feel the smoke it's really bizarre
B	no yeah yeah it's the whole sensation of
D	but that most likely your brain association with
A	absolutely yeah
D	but the good thing I should say just to round it up was if you stop smoking
B	mm
D	your DNA reverts back
A	interesting
D	so it's
B	how long do you have to stop for?
D	er I can't remember how long they profiled it but it's a reasonable
B	so if it stays in your system for three months
D	yeah it's it's a it's I was gonna say three months but I don't think it is three months I think it's longer than that er but I don't think they fully know because
A	I mean you can find like I've heard you can find like cannabis in people's hair for like years afterwards that doesn't really change
B	we have a friend who er his father's er I mean he's American his father's American it's actually a part of his job description they're not allowed to be smokers because of health insurance reasons
A	it's quite common out there actually
D	mm
B	but yeah like it's part of your job description you can't smoke cigarettes
D	no they've they've erm yeah cos I went to this HR training cos I was been hiring someone and there was something about you can't you can't ask obviously you can't ask a lot of questions about people's health and things but you can ask if they're a smoker that's one of the only things you can ask
B	mm yeah that's one you can ask yeah you're right you can't ask
A	they ask us every time we sign up to the doctor's or something they're like do you smoke? have you ever smoked? course I drink
B	yeah
C	should have you have you ever done that alcohol thing they survey they do when you
B	oh yeah yeah yeah I always lie
A	we just had to do it for uni we just signed up for
B	we just did it for the uni doctor and they were like do you ever eat er consume more than nine units in
C	one particular
B	in one in one thing?
C	which is how
B	how often do you do this? weekly monthly or never I went never
C	which is effectively
A	three glasses of wine
B	it's a bottle of wine yeah it's a
A	I'm not gonna lie it really has been bad for us so we need to stop drinking we haven't really drunk until today have we?
B	no yeah
C	don't don't worry yourself I think erm you know
D	I think it's also
C	you can be quite hard on yourself in your
D	yeah as long as you're aware of it I think that's a good
C	whatever it's like I think people lose sight of what their behaviours are
A	yep when we
B	yeah
C	cos that's how I feel as well cos I you know I love drinking so
A	the problem
C	yeah
A	everything is about drinking so we have a few friends it is here but I think it's easier to because you don't have a support network of your family and your friends and all those kind of people so there are foreigners there that become alcoholics
D	oh yeah
A	and they don't have people around them to help them to stop them
B	to help them to keep it in check
A	and and then people come and go so they don't realise quite to the extent how much of an alcoholic this person is then they kinda stay there
B	yeah we worked with one lady
B	who at the first semester at the university we just thought you know she's I thought she had her shit in order and stuff like that but the longer we got to know her the more we realised that she was getting drunk constantly during the week
C	yeah
B	and then they come over in the morning to teach
A	I mean she must have got through
B	she can drink three bottles of wine on her own and it's just like jesus woman
A	oh yeah on a good weekend yeah I've seen that lady drink two or three bottles to herself you know what I mean and I she goes funny as well
B	yeah
A	she gets a bit schitzo with it she just snaps and she's a different person she starts pulling faces and doing weird stuff
B	yeah funny
A	but the problem is her best friend is also an alcoholic to a point where I've seen him down a bottle of
B	yeah
A	and then went and had two or three bottles of
C	and you told me about
B	yeah yeah
A	completely wrecked at like three in the afternoon
B	like a Saki yeah cheap Saki
A	I came I think the closest I've ever been to like dying through alcohol once in Korea I don't normally vomit but this was a bad night do you know one fifty-one?
C	yeah
D	yeah
B	yeah
A	I'd never heard of it before so they cracked out the bottle we're shooting one fifty-one and then I'm chasing one fifty-one with whisky so I'm shooting whisky as much
B	I wasn't I wasn't partaking in this event me and
A	one
C	oh no
A	I was to the point where I had to go home and like I think I got lost cos I don't know what happened but I woke up in the morning laughing my head off
B	yeah I woke up to
A	and I don't vomit ever so this was
B	he'd obviously vomited in our bathroom sink it was a bit touch and go so it was blocked and he'd obviously tried to like rinse that
C	and then it just
B	and so these little shower rooms we have in Korea the entire floor any everything was just covered in this pink vomit
B	and then I'm like and then
A	I don't really know what happened but I woke up
B	and he's laughing to
A	it's really hard to say Korean words
C	get home
A	get to your
B	laugh laughing to yourself for about twenty minutes until the
A	and then I had the shakes and I've never had those before
C	oh my god
A	I was really shaking like
B	you looked fucking ill
A	yeah I was bad
B	but I think some people have those hangovers more often than
A	I mean we we drink the four of us could polish off not could always polish off two bottles of whisky between the four of us that's just a standard the way we drink pretty much
B	that's quite drunk
A	and that's quite a lot of alcohol
C	thing is that's the thing though if you drink frequently your tolerance is obviously towards it changes
B	yeah
C	and things like that
A	and our tolerance to wine is very low
B	it's just we've been around
C	it's it's it's yeah it's really different isn't it? cos obviously we had one hangover on holiday and we drank you know not like loads
D	oh we drank quite a lot
C	well
C	we enjoyed ourselves
D	we had started drinking at like
D	on on the beach
B	that's why you're looking at your
C	no no no no that's what I'm saying I'm saying across the holiday we were fairly okay with the alcohol like cocktails here and there wine with dinner der der der but when we were in
D	and we went to we went to dinner we went to this really nice it was like my mum and dad had given us some money as well which is really nice of them so that we went out for like a special meal
B	yeah yeah
C	erm and they had this dining deal on called
D	and it was this like
C	and the food was like
D	it was like Michelin star level foods but it was it was Cuban inspired as well
C	yeah
D	which meant it was kind of probably the only place you could get that kind of food
C	it was just oh
A	plantains
C	yeah lots of that
B	thirty-nine dollars that's ridiculous that's like twenty pounds
C	it was sort of like inspiration more like the spices and things coming through it like I had I had this amazing salmon but it was like sharing plates and kind of came in this kind of looked like a present
B	mm
D	yeah
C	came up and then they had a special guy come and cut the thing and then it all fell apart like little flakes
A	what was it
C	like a cellophane type thing cos they had steam that they had cooked it in the thing but
D	oh yeah yeah I remember that one
C	but it was like it looked like a little present and er
A	you get that in we were just in Cambodia and there's like a curry that they wrap in a banana leaf and it comes with a little tie that you can undo it and it's like opens up
C	but so after that we had wine no we had a cocktail at dinner
D	and we were also we were sitting on the beach we were
C	oh yes so we were sat on the beach
B	at four o'clock
C	er and then in our hotel they had free wine hour between five and six so we had
C	so we had we had maybe two glasses of wine
D	three
C	three glasses of wine
B	in an hour
C	and then we had a cocktail
D	no also you had another glass of wine in the hotel
B	ah
D	this was before we got to the
A	so you've already sunk a bottle
C	yes
D	I know I had a couple of beers
B	I don't think I'd remember my dinner by that point
C	well no dinner was brilliant had a really great time at dinner
D	we had a cocktail when we got to dinner and then I ordered cos they had a really nice bottle of er French wine on there and I was like oh my god there's French wine
C	as the food is cheap let's get the wine
D	and the few the food was like really cheap
C	the wine was more than the food probably
D	and then a lot more a lot more
B	I imagine so yeah
D	the wine was really expensive
D	and it was really really
D	the wine was great
C	yeah it was really nice
D	and then so the I was like yeah you know cos I really when I find a bottle that I really like it's just like it it just goes
C	and then we went to this bar
D	oh no and then you're missing our I had dessert wine
C	oh you had some of that I didn't erm I don't like dessert wine
A	second
C	and then we went to this cocktail bar called the Broken Shaker which was on the back of the youth hostel
D	yeah
C	which was really nice but full of quite a few portentous people
B	ah
D	well yeah so I was a bit
C	you were
D	there was people on the table and I was like oh yeah can I play let's play ping pong
C	and then there was this
C	no like three of them were nice but then there was like this it was actually the English guy that was the arsehole
B	surprise
C	surprise surprise
D	they were all English
C	no they weren't
D	well the girl was from Newcastle
B	well the girl from Newcastle was nice but the rest of the rest of them were from different countries
D	oh were they? so they got oh oh okay
C	it was just the guy from England that was being an arsehole so we had two cocktails there and then we got a taxi back to the hotel and our bar had a really nice cocktail er waiter
D	had a er yeah
C	he was very good
D	and so then I
D	but they also had a gin they also had gin er
B	a nice Cuban
D	like amazing gin selection
C	no he was American he was Missouri
A	do you like your gin?
B	oh Missouri yeah
A	what do you drink?
D	huh?
A	do you Gordon's
D	oh no like erm so dunno what my
A	never heard of it
D	which is the brewery erm
C	they do ales in Suffolk
D	they started
B	oh okay
D	yeah er Southwold is where they're based and they've
A	do you like whisky much?
D	erm I used to drink a lot of whisky before I met
A	no
D	so
C	I just realised about that card cos I was looking at it cos I thought they were all different spirits bottles but before I gave it to you I think they're all whisky bottles
B	oh that's
C	oh no that's perfect
D	so erm
B	that is our go to liquor
D	so
B	yeah thank you
D	I used to drink like Talisker er and like most of the smoky ones
A	yeah
D	erm what is the other one? I used
A	yeah yeah
D	er
C	what's that one that your brother likes?
D	on no yeah so there's an English whisky do you know about this?
D	er it's just north of Cambridge is where it is it's the only cos in order to be a whisky you have to do something special or something
A	yeah
D	yeah so erm it's yeah so it's not a I guess they call
B	it's not where it's from then?
D	bourbon er before it's not from where it's from it's like the particular process that you make and it's the only English whisky
A	do you like the bourbon?
D	erm
A	sour mash
D	I mean to be honest I like anything that's got alcohol in it
C	I really like tequila a big tequila
A	most people
D	oh
B	I can't stomach too much tequila
B	got a gag reflex
A	it's a bit like spiced rum
D	see I'm not that's probably rum is probably my lowest on the list I think
C	I like rum in a cocktail
B	mm
A	we don't really do cocktails do we? it's just a neat
B	yeah we drink that's that's our way of being healthy when we drink our bottles of liquor is we don't have there's no coke in it we don't have Coca Cola like that's really bad for your health
A	well we quite fizzy I haven't drunk a fizzy drink in years
B	no yeah I don't drink any drinks that can't
D	that was the easiest thing when you're trying to quit sugar that's for me the easiest thing to cut out immediately was fizzy drinks
C	seriously I think I'd be genuinely cos I'm erm since we got back since we got back from America I'm as I said I'm really trying to be quite regimented erm but I've started you know like tracking everything that you eat kind of consume and I think actually my diet is not shit it's actually the fact that I like to have a glass of wine
B	er it's the alcohol
C	there's all those calories
B	yeah yeah yeah it is yeah definitely
A	it's not good for you
B	when we travelled South America
A	I'm surprised you haven't found any markers on your DNA from
C	from alcohol
B	there must be
C	and that must mean it's not
D	but but I think one of the things is obviously we've been drinking as a human race for a long time
B	culture for a very long time
A	okay so if they looked into more Asian cultures where instead of
D	oh well so there is I mean actually saying this there is a gene that we have
A	yeah
D	that the Asians don't have
B	don't have yeah we know that
A	yeah I know that because we were purifying water by making beer but they were making tea for like a long time so
D	yeah
A	so
C	that's why they
A	lotus tea or whatever kind of teas they have
D	basically they they created ceramics too early and er
D	they learnt how to deal with water whereas we were like ah let's just brew beer
A	beer and that will
D	and of course the beer we used to drink was you know two percent that's the other thing that's changed a lot now
B	yeah yeah
D	but now it's like four or five
B	process
C	but that's the same for wines as well isn't it? cos they're saying you know there's the rise of the fourteen percent bottle when actually you know a lot of wines
D	they should be eleven or twelve yeah
B	ah okay
D	should be well it depends on the use though
C	yeah
D	so there are I mean a proper red wine is actually thirteen or fourteen percent
A	you'd probably like your
D	yeah
A	it's like at seventeen percent or nineteen or twenty-one percent or something but it's so cheap
B	you won't love it though it's a terrible hangover
A	it is the most consumed alcohol in the world I didn't realise this
D	wow okay
C	did you did you hear about the erm before?
B	because China consumes it
C	yeah well erm
B	the amount of bottles that are consumed
A	I think the reason is
B	yeah
A	is there are only about two or three companies that make soju and with vodkas and other
C	it's by byjo I think or did I invent that?
B	byjo
C	no
D	byjo
C	byjo
D	are you not thinking of when we go oh by jove?
C	oh byjo
B	byjo it might just
C	it's probably the same thing but just like
A	they've got what Koreans call fire soju which is Chinese and that goes up to fifty percent so it's more like a
B	and it's for the for the same price
A	yeah it's for the same price
D	I love the idea that
B	they're basically drinking paint stripper
C	not the same not not the same thing at all because obviously you know this is all regulated alcohol we hope erm in most instances it's you know
B	yeah
A	we've heard of cases where people have died from
C	well that's what I was saying cos there was erm cos obviously you know like a lot of very rich young people in their gap years go to like
A	Thailand or
B	Indonesia and places like that
C	Indonesia and they sell the buckets of alcohol
B	yeah that happened recently didn't it? yeah
C	there was a woman that died through erm basically she thought she'd bought gin
B	yeah
C	died
B	she was quite young as well wasn't she?
C	yeah she was only like nineteen
A	we've been in we worry when we're abroad
B	that'd be terrible and there were three of them I think and she drunk the most
C	she she got
B	yeah
A	there were there was a case of two Korean teachers two English teachers but living in Korea that went somewhere and they were found
B	they were in Vietnam weren't they?
A	in the
B	rooms
A	apartments blood everywhere they'd been vomiting blood all night
C	oh
B	they were found dead the next like couple of days later they went missing
A	we've had a few teachers die
B	they suspect that was through some sort of dodgy alcohol or something that's
A	it's part and parcel of travelling we were on a beach in the Andaman Islands three months later I read an article some woman was eaten by a salt water crocodile on the exact beach we were just swimming on yeah you know what I mean?
C	god
A	we were in a few places in Latin America massive volcano
D	that's why I like England and
B	I know
D	no salt water crocodiles
B	well for a start you're not gonna stand out long in the sea either
A	do you know how do you know how big the
B	they are dinosaurs
A	a nine metre long crocodile
B	dinosaurs er crocodiles and sharks
A	I mean they've been around for as long as
D	sharks have been around longer I'm not that sure
A	they're like perfectly
D	but yeah you just the easiest thing with crocodiles is just like stay away from the edge
C	into town shall I just say or shall I just text saying we'll go into town
D	cos the only way they kill people is basically attack as they spring off the floor and then use the their
A	like in the shadows
D	yeah they can't run can run away from a crocodile very
A	in Latin America we went to quite a few places with lots of caiman there were like loads of caiman
D	oh my god
A	I'm wondering if by the time we get there it's going to have wound down a little bit
B	yeah
A	I mean we'll head that way do you know a good restaurant? somewhere we can eat
B	she might know
D	well what about a late nights pub do you know where that is?
C	oh do they have they got one down here?
D	yeah they've just opened
C	does it do anything other than real ale though?
D	can you well what else do you need?
B	I know I do like a nice real ale
D	so we have so we have a a brewer erm that's near us that they've just opened they well I say they've just they've been there over a year now er pop up er pub
B	okay
D	and by the fact it's been over a year it's not really a pop up anymore right?
B	no it's established
C	and also then moving next door to
D	they're moving next door now and it's like they do the best burgers and they're like what what are they? five pounds six pounds
C	six pounds
B	phwoar that's really good
A	that's pretty good
D	and their burgers are like really good burgers
B	it's usually in a pub once a pub serves a
C	they've got they've got a pop up in our place but they've also got one
D	they've just opened the a new pub in
B	where's that then? do you know the location?
C	just finding it out for you
B	all this technology
D	or I can just tweet the
C	thirty-eight dean street
B	oh I mean we're
C	just put it in just put it in maps
B	yeah just put it in your maps you get erm
D	I mean we don't have to go there at all but I just thought
B	oh no I'm more than happy to for anything that's recommended cos we don't the only place we'd eaten so far is there's a pub just out on that main street we came in and that's just because it's up the road so when we moved we took the family there and we went for a really good carvery in a pub actually dean street
D	oh yeah it's very close
B	oh is it? nice
D	near
B	oh we walked past
C	yep
B	so we're on the
B	it's got all the
A	couldn't get you guys to fill out these forms?
C	yeah yeah yeah yeah
D	yeah
B	would that be alright?
C	I've got a
B	this is really erm
A	shall we move the table over? how are we gonna do this?
D	I think we just go to there I think
A	yeah
B	it's before you even get to Waitrose so that is really close so we know where that is where's
A	erm
D	probably search
A	it's where we were the other day it's right on the seafront do you know that big green area that we walked through and went oh it's all green and big here? that's
B	alright so it's it's
D	so is that is that a
B	oh it is working yeah sorry I just started using it automatically it came with this this
D	oh okay
A	thank you very much
C	today's date is
A	and it says you've got to put the month in words for some reason
C	what's the date today?
A	oh gosh
B	the sixth of September
D	it's the sixth yep
A	yeah it's the sixth
B	yeah it's the sixth of September
A	do you want something to lean on?
B	but you can er
C	no it's okay
D	I'll just I'm just gonna go over there once I
A	that you very much for this
B	that's what the table is for
D	it's alright I'm I'm like in so many studies now cos I've get my blood taken all the time
A	yeah
B	so your name's getting about is it
D	yeah
A	well this
D	so if they cross reference me with any other and you also sometimes you have to probably not on this one because more for the medical and you have to say whether you're in any other studies
B	oh right no yeah this isn't considered this is just a collection this is just to create a corpus so
A	this is quite interesting actually all of us so basically they Cambridge University Press made a corpus do you know corpus linguistics like a body of linguistics?
unknown_female	mm
A	they made like a corpus of written language a few years ago from the British public and now they're making a corpus of spoken
B	be in anyway
A	like cos I mean for social history like historians are gonna go back and
B	the written one that they did was that when they got everyone on the internet to document that day of their lives?
A	I'm not sure
B	cos I did that
A	they did they did like a
B	it was a few years ago
A	yeah they did like it was like a three hundred million word corpus so it was massive
C	in London for three years
B	no I don't know
D	yes
B	we erm but this this run is like
A	yeah they pay us twenty pound an hour of recording it's pretty good yeah
B	there's some stipulations isn't there?
A	yeah I mean we have to analyse it afterwards and that kind of stuff but like erm we have an unlimited amount of recordings with the same people it can be until next June they need that many recordings
B	so they're gonna have thousands of hours of recordings
D	so they
A	they need thousands and thousands of hours basically
D	so can you can someone ask for access to this data or is this?
A	once it's published yeah it will be a part of the corpus
B	but as you read in that part the
D	Google say can I can I have all this data? cos obviously there's a lot of voice automation stuff that's been going on
A	mm
B	yeah yeah yeah yeah
D	and will they ask?
B	I think I wondered if this is
A	from what they're saying they're saying that it will be used for research and for ELT purposes for teaching English and for that kind of stuff so you are you might find they take a snippet and you're on a book somewhere and but I doubt it we talk too quickly
B	but things like I said this to my brother cos he was like really he was showing me his voice recognition on his phone and I was saying that's actually quite good because when we were in the States just two years ago and we were using Siri on the Iphone they it could understand our American friends quite well but it couldn't us at all
D	oh you should try I mean if you try it now it's
C	Siri Siri does not like me
B	yeah yeah
A	I've been reading quite a bit about
B	so I wonder if stuff like this is gonna get sold off towards stuff like that as well
A	thing is I've been reading a bit about computational linguistics and it's really difficult for them to make this software because it's all well and good saying you know they can make the they can understand the words but the problem is polysemy which words that have various meanings that come from the same root so if I say just a sentence on its own oh I'm feeling really high right now you don't know if high means mashed on drugs or if it means literally altitude that high and the problem with the all languages is that there is so much polysemy so it's really difficult for a computer programme to know which word you're saying then you have connected speech the computer programme needs to be able to take apart our words it's we know that we're speaking in separate words but actually it's completely connected there's no break in the speech so it's
B	it has definitely improved though now
A	it's improved but from what I've read it's really difficult to make a very good system
D	well all all of the algorithms I
B	thank you
D	er basically build and work on are that
C	yeah
B	so this is
C	yeah okay
D	it's called machine learning
A	yeah
D	erm and at one point I was thinking of working in that kind of field so I mean like for me that's why I was asking those questions
A	yeah
D	I'm particularly interested in it on a sort of research level
A	are you happy to contribute?
D	mm mm
A	yeah no problem
D	yeah yeah
A	thank you very much and I guess every time we meet you we'll probably erm need to record again
D	no that's no problem I mean you know I I mean I can't be a researcher and not erm give away my data
A	no no of course yeah
D	do you know what I mean? so erm
A	and if we can help with any research you're doing at any point
D	well
A	are you just writing the date? yeah September I can't believe it's September already
D	well I mean I definitely love er you know you guys should come over we'll cook erm
A	yes and we'll return the favour of course
D	and then yeah you can return the favour
A	yeah definitelty as I said if we'd been here a little bit longer I'd have cooked
D	no I mean totally understand just erm
A	still getting set up really at the minute
D	I'm just trying to think I am twenty-eight aren't I?
D	I need
B	what year were you born?
A	yeah
D	eighty-five
B	yeah what month?
A	which month?
D	December so eighty-five yeah I'll be twenty-nine
B	you'll be twenty-nine in December
A	I'm eighty-six but I'm twenty-eight so yeah I was born in May
B	she's eighty-seven
D	she's eighty-seven May
A	so we were in the same year at school I believe
D	yeah
B	yeah yeah she
A	I took a gap year before uni as well
B	when is your birthday in December?
B	mm
A	pretty close to Christmas
D	yep
D	mm so for nationality is it just UK or do you want British?
A	you write what you feel
B	you write what you feel yeah yeah we're wondering if this is also something that they'll look into yeah
A	this might be part of their study
B	yeah
A	they might wonder what people are saying about their nationality
B	because yeah what do you consider your?
A	especially with your accent what do you consider your accent to be your dialect?
D	my accent? I don't think I have an accent
B	yeah there you go exactly that's nice
A	and if you think that write it linguistically that's quite interesting cos everyone has an accent
D	yeah no yeah I I know what I'm erm saying is not
B	but then yeah but then also
D	so is that what mother tongue mother tongue is my English
B	no mother tongue is English yeah but I can appreciate cos some people might think well my accent's actually become quite diffused
A	yeah
B	so I haven't got an accent from a specific region it doesn't mean I don't have an accent
D	which country has most
B	England I know I guess that's kind of where it's from
A	well you you sound like you've got quite a bit of American influence do you say basil or basil?
D	er basil
B	basil
A	good
B	it's still English
D	accent dialect
C	are you just talking about?
D	so what can I put not none can I put that?
A	yeah you write what you think
B	yeah
A	but I mean would you say you have
D	a what?
A	received pronunciation like Queen's English
B	standardised English
D	oh no cos well Queen's English to me means a correct er like BBC Radio Four English
B	yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	elitest
B	that's received pronunciation yeah so you know you don't have that but you
D	I know I don't that
B	yeah
A	so if you could pin point any accent what would it be?
B	what would ah what would any of our accents be at this point?
C	you are
B	is that a Stokey twang?
D	that's what
C	my accent is quite malleable based on who I'm hanging around with
B	which is good which is er completely part of the whole linguistics
C	not necessarily in
B	yeah yeah
C	I could start getting a proper west country
B	oh there you go
A	combination
C	and similarly when I go back to Medway or if I hang around with my dad for a bit cos my dad's accent is quite broadly Medway
D	do I tick all of there or just the
B	yeah it's shocking when I go home
C	but my mum is
A	must be nice to be able to
C	my mum is not so much but my dad is
B	yeah
D	I was just thinking
C	so if I hang around with my dad for a bit I end up getting a little bit more rough
D	oh this'll this'll this'll
B	I've noticed
A	that's called accommodation
B	yeah
A	how we converge or diverge with the speakers that are around is
C	yeah
A	like definitely do you remember when you were a child you went into an Indian corner shop and you start emulating? they ask you a question and you kind of reply in an Indian accent you're like that was really weird I shouldn't so apparently it's a natural
B	I've noticed erm
D	yeah my my little brother does it cos he's now in the States
B	oh yeah that must be heavy
D	it's within
B	but a Carolinian accent is quite
D	within a week like it was really bizarre like he'd changed it completely and I'm just like
C	and he's married to an American woman and erm she's amazing
B	it is it is a massive influence on you like going to Korea
A	oh yeah we use Americanisms
B	oh yeah yeah my yeah
A	I say candy I can't remember if it's a couch sofa or a settee anymore
B	someone else told you settee we don't remember settee
A	no erm
B	you were like what do we call it?
A	I say vacation
B	yeah yeah
A	cos it makes sense to me like holiday is like Christmas or New Year or that's a holiday like a festival something religious or something but vacation is the time you have off work so it's actually filled a lexical gap for me
D	what did
B	oh nothing we'll do that
D	okay
B	it was just it was nothing specific we have
A	just write various
B	alright
D	various
A	various yeah various artists
A	just to fuck just to fuck those with Ipods
B	yeah
D	oh is that in Peep
B	no there's no new we've just be re watching the old ones
C	they've got one more season
B	yeah they have you like Peep Show?
C	yeah yeah
B	good
B	I fucking love Peep Show too
C	I was I was quite
C	I was quite I was quite
D	I do like it but like
B	mm
D	yeah
C	cos it was on it used to be on Channel Four but like at
A	yeah
B	really late at night before we went to university
A	yeah oh yeah I watched it
C	it was literally probably as we were going to university
B	yeah
A	and it was always at least
B	there were a couple of episodes I recognise
A	every year it was released like every September
C	have you watched any of Fresh Meat?
B	no
A	no
C	cos that's er well it was
D	oh you should watch that
[ANNOTATION]	C has watched episodes of Fresh Meat	Entailment
C	it's quite good yeah it's erm about a group of students in a shared house at Manchester like they're supposed to be the subsidiary college of Manchester University so
D	is this our pen?
C	yeah it's our pen in fact it's
A	thank you very much guys so every time we see you now we'll be recording
C	good
A	we only have to do this once
C	good I'll keep my secrets in here but erm
B	oh when I was sitting down with my brother
A	this is perfect for us though like
B	don't need to know what you're doing on your
A	we don't have to go for any job interviews I don't need to dress up smart we've already I mean I was only home for a week
B	yeah this
A	and a week in my family I managed to do twenty hours of recording so that was like three hundred and fifty pounds just for
B	I did about four hours
C	oh wow
[ANNOTATION]	A was home for a month	Contradiction
D	they paid you though?
A	they're paying me at the end of the month
B	yeah they haven't paid us yet
A	so every month we
B	so stuff could come back and it's like but it is gonna get trickier because your family A are very talkative and B you were at home but when we're just the two of us in
A	we need people to visit so come up or we'll come to yours
C	well we're introducing you to
[ANNOTATION]	A has brother	Neutral
B	yeah that's true
C	for a cup of tea also you'll meet people at the university
B	at university there should be more than women participating I hope but
C	it depends if you want you could incentivise first year students with like a Weatherspoons voucher
B	yeah yeah I know we did consider monetary
C	yeah
B	I'll buy you a beer if you come to the pub with me
[ANNOTATION]	C prefers tea over coffee	Neutral
A	I'm telling everyone that I meet like you guys you wanna make some recordings just the two of you or whoever else we'll pay you nine pound an hour for
C	yeah
A	we'll get the other nine pound
C	it's not a bad little racket
A	no nine pound an hour's still good for just prick pressing play you know what I mean like pressing record
D	I still don't like where have they got the money from?
[ANNOTATION]	A does a lot of video recording	Entailment
A	yeah it's just a lot of
B	it's from funding so corpus I suppose just some linguistics funding
A	thousands and thousands of hours of recording
C	my boss is quite an interesting person to talk to
A	er eight it's eighteen pound an hour
C	because he is Nigerian
A	and it's pro rata'd so like ten minutes is three pounds
D	I'm I'm surprised well I guess it's cos of the UK boom but you know there's like
[ANNOTATION]	You don't get any money for the recordings, it's purely volentary work	Contradiction
A	mm
D	erm because it's obviously apparently the big thing for is when people ring customer service centres
A	yeah
D	what they can then do is they take the first when you first ring they you should be angry but then they can measure the performance of the service by working out whether you've diffused
A	how much more relaxed you are yeah
D	whether you've diffused that and so that's what the company's based on and the biggest problem they've got is they need people to they need a database of angry voices and
A	yeah
D	like not angry voices and try and work but of course if you say to someone act angry
A	it's not real
D	they generally like just say well they what this guy was saying is that what happens is people get louder and anything so what they're trying to do now is take movie clips
A	yeah
D	of of various things or just general Youtube videos and so but what they then need is people to
A	yeah
D	er and so what they've started to do is releasing these videos short bit of audio essentially actually so it's just audio not cos also when you also take information from the face when you're looking at a video so it's just audio
A	like queues on
D	and they're paying people like twenty
A	no and we're getting twenty quid an hour
D	and you're getting like twenty quid
A	twenty quid an hour this is perfect for us the only reason I found this is cos I signed up to the university linguistics department prior and about a month ago this was posted on that group and it just said calling you know and it's gotta be members of the British public can't be anyone else erm
D	well yeah that's why I asked whether you got paid
A	I mean it's Cambridge University Press so it can't be too bad and they've I've already sent my invoice off I sent off twenty hours we've already got another ten hours ready to go this month
D	I guess you have to have the equipment though and that
A	yeah we had to buy these we've got one each but they were like forty quid each so after two hours you've got you've made you money back erm recording in a car is that a little bit too noisy? recording out in a park is almost like
D	yeah
A	so we need to get people in our room like is
D	yeah
A	so we can sit down and kind of do it and then I have to
D	mm quite a lot of topics
A	quite a few yeah so I have to go back and listen I don't have to listen to the whole thing
D	yeah you just skip through it
A	but I skip every few minutes
D	yeah
A	cos people talk about the same topic roughly for about three or four minutes so then it kind of changes
D	it could be really interesting as well like you could if you could define the areas of topics you could start I mean you have all that data you could see how long topics last and then and then you you probably work out what and you can start thinking about what yeah
A	yeah definitely depending on do topics last longer if there's only two speakers rather than four?
D	well yeah
A	is there topics move around quicker? like this kind of stuff I don't know they do all this when there's two different conversations going on that must be a bit difficult but erm I'm hoping that you know by the time it comes round to writing my dissertation I'm gonna have hundreds of hours of recording at that point so I'm hoping that I can do
D	well if the if it's a public database
A	then it should be allowed so yeah
D	yeah you just have to write to them I'm sure I'm I'm fairly sure
A	I mean surely I can use my own recordings but I mean I guess I'm selling them to them so they become their property so I don't really know
D	you just
A	I've signed a contract I've got a freelance contract
D	yeah
A	I now have to it's annoying as well I have to be self assessed for taxes and stuff like that to do this job it's a little bit annoying
D	that so my my mum and dad are tax er they basically my dad works for so you know all this er er tax avoidance and
A	mm
D	evasion so one's right and one's not right he was basically he used to do that stuff for big companies which is kind of hilarious er that it's all like hit the news cos it's been going on for like
D	er
A	I haven't seen it on the news
D	oh okay so now it it came about because erm the biggest one that hit was Jimmy Carr
A	okay
D	erm basically offshoring his tax you know basically his money and actually a lot of entertainers so Gary Barlow happened a couple of weeks erm
A	I'm pretty terrible with celebrities I'm not gonna lie
D	well he was in Take That
A	okay oh right I thought he was in Coronation Street
D	no Gary no there may be a Barlow in Coronation Street
A	is there a Barlow?
D	but this is the lead
B	okay
B	yeah well yeah
C	from Nigeria or wherever
B	yeah yeah
C	but it's really
B	yeah
C	but it's changed has changed
B	yeah  I I think
C	cos
B	yeah yeah
C	whereas
B	I think she does I agree
C	I think maybe she does also because
B	no exactly so I think she's probably come from a position
C	the
C	well yeah
B	I was I was like what? and also when I went out with
C	and I I I think Medway accent is actually
B	no no it's not quite the same as Essex and it's not a lot of people
C	so consequently it means if I ever go back to Medway I just kind of
B	yeah yeah yeah it's the way they treat you I got that a little bit
C	I'll just I'll just go to the kitchen
A	oh okay and they've been
D	well basically the worst thing about it was that they set up a company or something to pay struggling artists
A	yeah
D	but not really
D	it was just a way of you know basically paying corporation tax rather than income tax cos corporation tax is lower or whatever I don't understand it
A	which makes no sense
D	yeah erm
A	I never really understood why you tax people when it's much simpler to tax corporations I don't understand why they deal with fifty million
D	er cos cos the thought process is is that the corporations are gonna make money for the government by employing people who you then tax
A	but my thought process is the only way to make money really is through a corporation and therefore wouldn't it be easier to tax say twenty thousand corporations than seventy million people?
D	but if you so
A	it would be easier wouldn't it?
D	so let's let's say that you increase corporation tax then Apple will say well we're not gonna sell our Iphone anymore erm
A	I mean I personally
D	and then people would be like what? we want an Iphone
A	I mean I
D	zover
A	have you ever seen an advert I only know about it through second hand cos I haven't been in the country but there's like Music Magpie or something
D	yeah
A	yeah where you give your CDs for pittance
D	yeah
A	you get like thirty pence
D	yeah
A	I've got about four or five hundred CDs and I was thinking brilliant don't need them anymore I'll sell them I came to have a look on the internet on Amazon for these companies and this is what I would consider a not viable company in today's society there's this company called Zoverstocks they will undercut anybody selling a CD second hand by a penny they just have an automatic piece of software that just undercuts everyone to the point where they're pretty much selling you know ninety percent of CDs like popular CDs for a penny and they're making their money off the postage but the way I think about this and they turn over about three million a year off or four million a year something like that and I've just got this feeling like if I have to physically send through the post my disc to you you then pay thirty P then you have to send through the post that disc to somebody else you're not making any money any profit off the CD you're simply making about fifty pence to a pound off the postage for you to make fifty pence or a pound this vehicle has to drive to wherever and then away from wherever to make two or three million pounds you're you're effectively doing eight million journeys around the country just to make a
D	but but they are making money
A	they're making but if you think if it's if your model is that this product has to be driven to London and then driven to Newcastle
D	but hang
A	and you make fifty pence
D	yeah
A	so you have to have millions of these to pay for your company that means that that car is driving around the UK millions of times just so that you can make a million pounds just seems detrimental to society to me
D	oh of course it's detrimental to society but if you're making money you can't stop people
A	well of course in the capitalist model you'd say well the sky's the limit
A	but I I guess what I'm saying is I'm against that kind of business model
D	yeah oh no that's
A	I think and some way Korea works where England doesn't is they still have services they still have businesses that are basically non profit that are they view them more as services when you go to a bank in England you want a new card you'll probably queue up at the cashier they'll then tell you sorry we can't deal with this here you need to go and use that phone on the wall so then you go and ring the phone and then they tell you you'll get a new card through the post in a week or two in Korea you get the card made for you right there and then in front of you they do it yeah or there's water in there they'll give you biscuits and food there's certain things are treated like a service still
D	oh yeah but
A	banking is still a service there
D	oh banking has changed a little bit maybe since if
A	maybe it has I haven't been banking
D	and also the post office has started to do this thing where instead of going to a counter you get like a number and you can go and sit and they'll bring you tea
A	oh nice
D	and all this kind of stuff and then you go up to a counter and then you sort your things out and then you you're done
A	so that service has come I guess what I'm saying on the broader scheme is you know education transportation utilities these things shouldn't be profit organisations
D	oh yeah I mean I have big problems with with
A	if you took that profit and let's just use public transport
D	I know my big I I I am like I just really wish that transport was not a private you know organisation
A	transport in this country is bonkers completely bonkers
D	like
A	like National Express if you live anywhere within the gravity of London then your National Express vehicle is gonna stop in London for about three or four hours so if I wanna go from Brighton to Canterbury which should be about an hour to an hour and a half on a bus it's gonna take six hours and it's gonna drive to Heathrow and then stop for three hours and then drive on back and it does that with everything we wanted to get from Bath to Birmingham it's only about an hour and a half up this road you know but you have to go through London wait at Heathrow I mean it's just ludicrous it's really easy in Korea public transportation there is good like it's a good service it's I think one of the best things about Korea is how reasonable the country costs they pay quite well but like you wanna traverse the country you're talking a biggest
C	I think my phone's stopped doing outgoing calls it's a bit buggered the screen's going
B	yeah yeah I would
C	er we were we hired a van to move some stuff into our flat from
B	no no
B	that's really nice
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	and then if I see her if I see her
B	I'm just gonna do something
D	yeah the only problem with with I mean it's weird right was happens especially in the UK is that so all of these things involve people that you've gotta employ
A	and those people need to be paid a
D	and they need to be paid a wage that they can live on
A	to their living
D	but then so in order to do that if if the living costs are high initially now they as they are now then they have to get paid so you can't reduce the cost of the train ticket
A	no no
D	so living
A	I I think Americans are actually doing quite well I don't know if just the demographic of Americans that we meet in America is more middle class? but it seems to me that they come from more affluent families their families have more land
D	yeah but their
C	it's about space
D	it's space yeah that's what it comes down to and
A	but then ask them how much they earn like their earnings are equitable if not slightly more than what my family are on in England you know what I mean? my dad has been a civil engineer for years he's probably on about twenty-two K my mother works for the government works in the borough she's probably on about eighteen grand a year and I speak to my America friends teachers get paid more there and this kind of stuff but yet the cost of living is lower and even when you include healthcare I mean we pay through the nose for healthcare we do pay for it we think it's free but we pay pretty sure if you add up all the taxes in this country we pay about fifty percent in tax if you add VAT twenty percent on everything we purchase
D	well I pay I pay
A	then you've got twenty percent on tax another ten percent on
B	yeah how much do you pay in tax? you've gone past that line
D	I've gone past I've gone past the line this year unfortunately
A	so just over forty
D	I'm on forty percent now
A	nice but that's forty percent of anything you earn above forty K
D	yeah that that's the nice thing and also you and the nice thing they're doing which is really
A	bloody hell man you're on forty grand
D	and so the nice thing that they're doing is
B	yeah they are aren't they? yeah
A	yes yeah they've upped them haven't they?
D	which was I think when I
A	it was six before
D	it was like six or seven when I first started
A	yeah
D	so that's like you know quite a considerable increase which is why I know it's sad to say well the
A	cos people are struggling
D	people are in trouble and the Conservatives are actually realising that actually it's not a bad way of doing things
B	yeah yeah
D	erm it's the only I think it's probably the only thing they've done right
A	yeah
C	the thing that they've not done right is on the headline of The Independent today
B	oh yeah that was
A	I've heard about this if you have a spare bedroom in a council property or something
B	that's only with that's
D	yeah
C	philosophically it might work but if you've not got the infrastructure to move people into one bed flats that don't exist then it's just penalising people
D	yeah yeah that's that's
B	cos they don't actually they don't create very much council accommodation that isn't a two or three bed house
D	that's that's that's the problem that
B	that's cos they're creating it for families so there is a problem
C	so that's what I'm saying philosophically it all works if it was a jigsaw puzzle you could just
D	well no it's
B	but isn't it just but isn't that still dependent on your situation? er I can't remember the ins and outs of that
D	no no it's all it's based
B	it's just based on a spare bedroom
D	it's based on if you're in a council er house
B	and you have a spare bedroom
D	and you have a spare bedroom although
B	your benefits will get reduced
D	two spare bedrooms you're allowed one spare bedroom
C	you you pay you pay a premium
D	you pay
C	the same way that if you were a single person occupying a double bedroom or a twin bedroom in a hotel you pay a premium
B	though they are these people that are in these houses actually paying a premium or are their benefits just getting reduced?
D	well no no no they have to their rent goes up
C	well cos they're not their benefits are paid out the same but their rent is more
D	yeah
B	oh okay so they are paying rent from
B	I mean it doesn't matter if it's coming from their benefits or something
D	no two spare bedrooms
A	two spare bedrooms
D	you've gotta have one you're allowed a extra bedroom
B	an extra room
D	so you're allowed a guest room but you're not allowed two guest rooms
B	yeah
A	yet a landlord can own twenty properties thirty properties it's not a problem
C	yeah no we're not saying that the bedroom tax is a good thing
A	no of course
B	no no yeah yeah yeah
D	well I
B	I don't know
C	it's a
D	I I actually I think it is a good thing I
C	philosophically it may be a good thing to try and have larger properties allocated to those people that need them yes
D	I don't think it should be in
A	of course yeah
C	but it doesn't work like that when you've not got the infrastructure to
D	yeah the problem is the problem is there's a different yeah
C	support people moving so what you're actually doing is just penalising people for their situation
D	but but it's well known that money the best way to do anything is to to use money so for example stopping people stopping the population from smoking you tax cigarettes it's work it's proven to work
A	do you think that's the best way?
B	they're doing a combination of things right now
D	it is the best way scientifically the best way to stop people smoking
A	scientifically
B	statistically
D	yeah
B	is that what?
A	I don't know if I agree with that? so tobacco companies or whoever is still making just as much money off these things only people are paying more for less
B	in in America in Tennessee
D	yeah but it stops so it stops so ah basically if people can't afford to do it they generally stop it and they and if they see that it's a money is a big driver in people's philosophy everywhere
A	well of course it has to be we live in a monetary paradigm so it can't not be a massive driver but
B	yeah thing is a lot of poor people still smoking
A	but erm
D	yeah the problem the problem with what what it causes
A	it just means that they're paying more for what they're smoking they're paying more for what they're drinking
B	I think less people starting to smoke that's definitely working
A	erm I think
C	well I think
B	yeah yeah are E cigarettes age restricted? E cigarettes
C	I think it's eighteen
A	yeah it's still
B	oh it's eighteen
A	the same as cigarettes
C	well the same as tobacco
B	I thought I'd heard something on the radio that suggested that as long like it was younger
A	I just don't like that model that you know we want people to drive slower so let's put speed cameras everywhere and just charge the money
D	yeah it works it works
A	it works because
D	ah no because it's actually it's a safety issue that is
A	okay I understand that but I mean I personally don't really like cars in general
D	oh no I mean I erm
A	I would go for
D	I had a car and I liked my car a little bit but the more I live in London and there's certainly built up areas there is just no way people should be driving
A	no
D	just absolutely no way
B	it's completely unnecessary
A	it should be completely pedestrianised there should be effective public transport between cities
B	and then you just need to reduce the cost of transportation
A	and if you wanna drive go to a race track go and rent a car out and drive it
D	yeah no exactly yeah
A	that's how I feel
D	I agree with
C	I had to deal with public training a public speaking thing at work when we had to train ourselves on presentation skills and we had to talk about a topic we were passionate about
D	oh yeah
C	and mine was the car free city
A	yes
C	so I'm very much at home here
D	now
A	we can't stand cars at all
A	but I've had people turn around to me and say but
B	that's what we were saying
A	we we
D	we've joined erm the car club for example
A	yeah
D	that's freedom that's like the case of if we need to go out of town
A	yeah
D	we need to hire a car because we need you can't get there easily like you were saying how it's bloody impossible to go from here to
A	yeah
D	in an easy route you know then you hire a car but you don't need as you say drive to work and drive home
A	no my personal my personal preference I think a way of moving to the next step would be nobody owns cars you don't own them there are just cars out on the street
D	a bit like the
B	on the outer city limits perhaps
A	and you go out and you I don't know put a coin in a you have a registration you have some registration
D	no they have so you have a card
A	really?
B	oh really? cheers there you go then this keeps happening to me
A	good that should be that should be
B	his ideas keep coming true
A	coming to fruition yeah
B	ah so how does that work?
D	you just basically have a card you book it online so you've got an app you can actually even you just use the app
A	find where the cars are and
D	basically they have specific parking spaces in London now
C	yeah we've got two round the corner from us
D	there's two literally round the corner but there's also a third one down the road
B	and are they delivery points and pickup points?
D	and no unfortunately the worst part about it is you have to drive back the car belongs to that space so you can't
A	what I'm thinking of effectively is you just turn you just take the keys out and then the car stays wherever it is you go in your house and somebody else comes out and uses
D	yeah so that's what they
C	they've got they've got they've got something like that in Paris
A	yeah
D	and so what they
A	I think that's the way forward
D	so what they do yeah I mean that's that basically the the the next step of
C	Boris bikes but cars
A	you don't need to feel like you need a car there are so many people that need a car but use it just to go to work and back and that's it car pool have a bus that takes you to work I don't know something
D	or cycle
A	live closer to work work from home
D	I would
B	yeah they're out here
D	if there weren't cars on the road
A	no no I would yeah cars are very aggressive as a cyclist
D	no it's just
