A	okay tell me again what you were saying about how much going to Spain cost?
C	well I think the house costed a thousand pounds and I think
A	cost cost not costed
C	how is costed not a word?
C	really?
A	yeah
C	huh
A	er it cost a thousand pounds for the holiday did it?
C	yeah
A	mm well as I said the thing is you won't know whether that was it probably was the flight and the accommodation where you were staying but what people forget about holidays is that you also want to have a bit of spending money cos you're going to be buying food out there and you want to enjoy yourself
B	we didn't need to buy food
A	mm?
B	we didn't need to buy food
C	yes we did we went to the shops and it was boiling and I needed to sit next to the freezer
B	yeah we actually had to go in the car and wait our car was so cool
A	who was in the car with you?
A	mm
B	granny
A	mm
B	uncle
A	no no but who stayed in the car with you when they went shopping?
C	dad
A	really?
B	yeah
A	he got to go out get out of shopping?
B	he said we were getting too hot and he had to stay with us
A	in the shop you were getting too hot?
C	yeah
A	was it not air-conditioned in the shop?
B	well erm
A	wow
C	I
A	but as you know the money for the sound recordings that we're doing even the one right now is towards going towards our holiday in
B	mm
A	and erm I think it's very expensive in
B	we saw that house
A	sorry?
B	we saw it
A	you've seen it haven't you? it's very pretty
C	how much does it cost?
A	right well I think it cost something like four hundred pounds for the week
A	which is very very good I mean but normally I wouldn't be able to afford it at all but what I'm saying is cos you were saying oh well you know we could
B	yeah
A	that we're going to live in for a week but I need to pay the rest of it but I need to make sure we've got enough money set aside for for food when we go there
C	and for souvenirs
A	and er yeah souvenirs and ice creams and you know one of those meals that we have at least will be hopefully fish and chips so I'm not constantly slaving in the kitchen like I do normally
A	so it's important that and also the petrol cos it's a really long way to go to
C	woah
B	also mum?
A	mm
B	erm
C	is it further than to Wales?
A	erm yes in terms of where we're going yeah er yeah definitely I'll have to show you a map
C	my gosh that's longer than a day there and back
B	erm mum
A	no I think I'm gonna go set off really early and just did what we do what we did when we went to Wales
C	get bored
B	okay so
A	you were brilliant in the car on the way to Wales
B	mum erm er do you?
C	and on the way back I had all those sweets
B	er I think we might erm I need to pack breakfast
A	mm
B	yeah?
A	yeah
B	but also I'm thinking
B	I really really I really really wish we could get that kind of film thing fixed
A	in the DVD the DVD player in the car?
B	yeah cos you can't do anything else in the car except from like
A	I can't afford that but we listened to audio CDs and that was brilliant actually wasn't it?
B	yes I didn't really like Hetty Feather it was quite sad
A	mm Hetty Feather was quite sad we'll get some up it'd be nice actually to
C	huh booya
A	we would definitely
A	sorry?
B	in the car we could make a story
A	mm?
B	and then listen it we'll listen to it
A	mm what? you mean record a story yourselves?
B	yes and we can listen to it
A	mm?
B	and then we can have and then we can have erm something like the
A	I
B	erm
A	I can't hear anything you're saying
B	in that book
A	the one that we were listening to?
B	yeah the one with about the boy
A	Tom?
B	yeah Tom
A	mm
B	and how they didn't come back
A	mm
B	that was a that was a cliffhanger
A	it was a cliffhanger
B	I want to know what happens
A	mm I don't think I don't see how I could record you making a story whilst I was driving but erm
C	finished please can I get down?
A	no
A	erm but we'll definitely pick some good audio CDs
B	yeah
A	I think it will take about eight hours of driving
B	and er and also erm
A	yeah
B	like we could stop at erm
A	we don't need to no we don't need to get up in the middle of the night cos I would be too tired to drive anyway
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	wake us up quite early we can pack some books well I can
A	I know but that's
B	cos it makes the driving so boring for him
A	no but that's why we're gonna listen to audio CDs
B	yeah
A	cos we can all listen to them then
B	can we take a toy?
A	yeah but the thing is because it's self-catering when we get there we'll be able to save a lot of money on kind of food because we'll make packed lunches and we'll have breakfast at at the house and everything
C	what does self-catering mean?
A	self-catering means when you cater for yourself you provide food for yourself that you're not like a hotel
B	erm I wish
A	which is all-inclusive where it provides all the food
B	I wish we had the money now so we could like go there I'm so excited
A	mm
C	we're going there in the summer holidays and even if we were a multimillionaire we would still be going there in the summer holidays
B	mum should we
A	yep
B	pack our pillows because we might be still a bit tired?
A	yeah and do you know what? that's a great idea and also because we're not going camping we'll have lots of room in the car because we had so much stuff to take last time
C	yeah
A	didn't we? I can't remember what we took for Wales it also seemed like a a really long thing but I do need to buy you suitcases I've completely forgotten about that
C	yeah and er we chose the suitcases
A	yeah we might hopefully they'll still be on sale
C	yes I really want to get a suitcase
A	mm
C	so like I can pack it
B	also
A	mm
B	I'm thinking shall I borrow my locket from dad's?
A	what's your locket?
B	the one with the I've got picture of grandad
A	if you want
B	okay
C	don't lose it
B	I cross my
A	but erm
B	heart and hope to die I'll never lose it
A	okay so yeah when we went to Wales it it took me six hours to drive so it's going
B	so
A	to take a little bit longer
B	six add
A	well it's two more hours to go to
B	two equals eight
A	mm
B	so
C	we only have four hours when we get there but
B	if we set off early we will
C	that depends er wait
A	hang on a minute what do you mean we've got four hours when we get there?
C	erm if if we would we set off at four
B	he interrupted me
A	alright well hang on a minute what were you gonna say
B	well if we leave early in the morning
A	like nine o'clock
B	if
A	sorry if what? mm?
B	we can get there before her so that means we'll get to check it out
A	yes we will she won't come until sort of halfway through the week I think
B	yeah
A	what were you gonna say?
C	I was gonna say that if we
A	well that's not true at all is it? if you left at four o'clock in the middle of the
C	what?
A	so like four hours in one o'clock so we'll have maybe er an hour's break because it's actually quite tiring to drive
B	yeah and just like stop at er somewhere
A	I'll stop at a you know a service station
B	yeah where you can just like erm
A	well no it'd be nice to have a little bit of wander go to the toilet
B	yeah
A	need to go to the toilet
B	and
A	and then we'll just try and go to get there as soon as we can
A	but it will be a I mean so I reckon we would get there about six o'clock in the evening
B	mm
A	so we'd have
B	I'm wondering which day should we do oh how about we do it on the
A	it's Friday to Friday I think that we've made the booking for
B	how about we? okay we're gonna
A	we go on a Friday
B	arrive
A	on a Friday yeah and come back on a Friday
B	we're gonna go on a Friday
A	and then er no and then we drive back on the Friday
B	okay
A	yeah
B	so we've still got six days erm that's good cos we'll get a lot of time there
A	mm
B	yeah
A	and we could on that last day stay hang around a bit but probably I think we'll just want to go home
B	I think it might cry
A	oh but do you know what? I'm so excited because it's all
B	yeah
A	we can that'll be so much fun I'm sure
B	also mum?
A	mm?
B	erm I bet it will cry
A	the house?
B	like no the the weather when we leave
A	oh that's alright as long as it
B	like it did in Wales
A	so long as it's sunny when we're there yes it did didn't it?
B	yeah
C	mm yeah it was sad for us to leave
B	I loved that beach
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	my favourite beach was still
A	mm me too but there is a very nice beach where we're going
B	yeah
C	mm
A	and er and I was very lucky cos when I put when I erm
A	bought it the the hotel I mean the holiday like literally a week later their prices
C	yeah
A	er er a holiday cottage in
A	I'm talking about but you're talking about a thousand pounds so it's about the same amount of money as Spain
C	wow
A	without a flight or anything
C	yes very lucky
A	and as I say I've paid
C	but it would be really
A	a hundred and odd mm?
C	really really really cool
A	mm?
C	if where we stayed
A	mm?
C	and then we were walking around to try and find that beach and then realised that we were in heaven erm we were in the adventure island series and there was a giant mystery going on there
A	oh and
C	yeah
A	that would be brilliant
C	and
A	the the first four
C	yeah
A	were weren't they?
C	the October
A	and this one is October half-term
A	we've got a week we can fit in a lot of adventures in a week
B	yeah like erm
A	you know discover buried treasure
B	also
A	mm?
B	on the day before Friday we can drink hot chocolate like we did there when we were on the beach
A	oh er sitting out on the beach yeah
B	I loved I loved putting my feet in the water
A	mm and we had a little we had fish and chips didn't we?
B	just splashing the water
A	and yes we had
C	mm
B	yeah
A	I hope she does pop over to see us
C	and we did climb down the rocks and found loads of ways back up and back down
A	mm but it is very small the cottage it's fine for us but you know your bedroom leads into my bedroom
B	yay
A	basically yeah I can't wait for the snoring
C	no I don't snore
A	I know it's
B	I bet it isn't as small as dad's old house
A	no no it isn't tiny I mean you've seen pictures it's just there there are only two bedrooms and one leads into the other so I think
B	yeah
A	she doesn't mind that
B	but also mum
A	mm
B	at dad's house it'd be smaller than that er it actually only had four rooms a bathroom
B	a bedroom a kitchen
A	mm
B	and a living room we ate in the living room
A	did she did you were your bunk beds then in his bedroom?
B	yes
A	uhu
C	uhu
B	and basically if we just wanted to go to
C	the bedroom was about as
A	mm
B	yeah which is quite the living room was was quite big compared to other rooms
A	well I saw the living room didn't I when I picked you up?
B	yeah when you and we just ate in there all the time
A	well that was just a temporary place that he was living in
B	yeah
A	and he was
C	and now he's at
A	the house yes I know cos you'd known it for two years two and a half years
A	but the reason why it was small
C	is
A	was because he was paying money towards this house
C	yeah
A	and he still is but not so much so that's why you know he didn't need a big house cos he only had you every other weekend and occasionally so you're this is your
B	mm
A	cos you're here most of the time
B	I wish we had an extra day just at dad's
A	oh
B	although he can't fit it in
A	no he can't darling
C	so anyway
B	just we see you all the time and
A	and I'm boring
C	no you're not
B	no we only see him

A	no I mustn't have any sugar
A	cos do you know? I went
A	I went to the
A	through the years it was very interesting
A	and then we went to a café and there was a gluten-free cake so I ate it and then within about half an hour I felt really ill just like really like my heart rate was going and I thought oh my goodness I don't feel very well and then I got home and I ate some normal food and then I felt fine and I thought oh my goodness I'm so affected by sugar now and do you know what? normally when you guys go away and I'm kind of sad and and like kind of missing you on Friday nights I always eat loads of rubbish like marshmallows or bad for you chocolate or something and then in the mornings I feel absolutely dreadful and I'm really tired but I didn't do that this weekend I did have some dark chocolate but
C	my dark my dark chocolate?
A	yes which was delicious erm and I had some er but I thought right I want to have a treat but I'm gonna be really good so I had some dates and I had some yogurt and things like that and do you know what?

A	their children might be ready in time tomorrow so there's this idea that on a Sunday night
A	you would start saying get your shoes on
A	and maybe just maybe the children would do it and I thought oh that's familiar
C	I am gonna do it
A	mm?
B	if you do I'll just go in slow motion like
A	no but it does show you that children just go into some weird time vortex where
A	they just don't do anything suspended animation
C	we go in the Tardis
A	I am gonna follow you one of these mornings just to see what you do
A	when I allow you to go off and brush your teeth for example and then I come up five minutes later and then you're just going to get your toothbrush and I think what have you been doing for the last five minutes? and then equally I'm brushing my teeth and I'm waiting for you to get your shoes on and I come down and you're both usually standing in the living room looking in the mirror
A	but neither of you have your shoes on or you haven't put your packed lunch in your bag and I'm thinking but what have you been doing the last five minutes? yeah what is it that you do?
