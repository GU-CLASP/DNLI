B	straight out of the showroom
A	I don't get why we've got such a bargain
B	it's good
A	I mean was that genuinely someone trying to get rid of them?
B	mm
A	and the amount of wrapping it took
A	was amazing
B	I think those giant cups are funny
A	but each cup was individually wrapped in newspaper and bubble-wrapped and
B	mm
A	so it must have taken ages for someone
B	these have never been
A	to send it
B	I don't think these have ever been
A	no
[ANNOTATION]	it took a short time to do it	Entailment
B	used cos
A	but I don't even want to put them in the dishwasher really
B	or even make tea in them
B	hello darling
A	but I think we should use them oh we should just use them like the other ones except not put these ones in the dishwasher maybe
B	well I don't mind you putting them in the dishwasher to the honest I like the giant teacups
A	except they'll get spoilt in the dishwasher
B	oh that's got a slight fault hasn't it?
A	and they erm tend to weaken after they've been in the dishwasher I think
B	yeah that's why they feel heavier
[ANNOTATION]	dishwasher may weaken cups	Entailment
A	these ones particularly fade
B	mm

B	they all say yeah
A	shit
B	no in in

[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B will wear pyjamas.	Neutral
B	well
A	I mean it's not as tasty and yummy and moreish as a normal wheat
B	darling we simply don't know
A	like bread
B	cos we've never experienced er
B	I mean I reckon it'll be like it'll take
A	yeah
B	but I think it will taste good
[ANNOTATION]	Buckwheat bread is less tasty than white bread.	Entailment
A	it's quite moist
B	what
A	good alternative
B	oh yes
A	if we don't want
B	it's good for me
A	lots of wheat

A	things need to be taken out of the machine and
B	well you didn't know what going on
A	put on the line before we do anything
B	you didn't know if you were coming or going because it isn't part of your responsibilities
A	no I actually quite like it as part of my responsibilities

B	and he didn't say why erm so so he
A	yeah
B	and then I thought oh shall I just
B	go with him?
A	yeah that close
B	cos I'd had enough beers to think it might be a good idea and then didn't
A	and you wouldn't have come home if you had
B	but then the second temptation was cos I got to rapidly got to
A	oh yeah
B	and then thought oh
A	easy get off
B	I could walk from here and maybe even beat
A	yeah
B	and that would be even that would be quite funny
A	yes
B	but I I resisted
A	and then you'd be like hi
B	yeah
B	but I resisted that too
A	it is a bit of a temptation and you would have spent I mean
B	well absolutely
A	about a hundred pounds
B	the other factor is that
A	er because
B	it was
A	and especially if you were there
B	well as
A	yeah she would have er
A	buy it then can't he?
B	and of
A	yes
B	er sorry not
