A	right so we've got the kids play
B	in comparison to a more remote location
B	er
B	artificial lighting could also affect the number of species present
A	yeah
B	what are are we so we're er concentrating on the amount of species and the types of species in the
A	are we gonna?
B	would that not mean that we'd need we should've used a quadrat?
A	well not if we do it as fauna as against flora
B	right
A	Cos if we were to do it like that then we'd get away with it
B	yeah er yeah
A	yeah
B	just whatever
B	basically we just need to write what we should've done
A	yeah
B	and then just say we've done it
A	so we need to read around these areas and develop ideas to test the field
B	I don't understand what that means
A	is it like we're supposed to work out?
B	Reading around these concepts and
A	um
B	so are we so then then supposed to look at because we have proposed that we're gonna do it on um the amount of species and er noise pollution effects er of species present
A	yeah
B	are we supposed to then read around any research to show if noise pollution affects the amount of species?
A	yeah
B	yeah
B	is there gonna be research on it?
A	I don't think there gonna  I don't think there gonna  be anything on that
