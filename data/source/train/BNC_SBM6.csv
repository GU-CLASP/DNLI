B	both are accurate both are fine
C	both a bit rough
B	stop
C	to be to be honest it's really upsetting me it feels like you're just watching really upsetting images

C	yeah she's tiny
B	and she doesn't really eat and the doctor's like you just have to eat she just doesn't really like eating food that much you know
A	it's I mean er genetics is important but it's it's it's nutrition and stuff that makes the difference

D	yeah
B	it's she sees things in films
C	but she's also yeah
B	you pick that shit up
D	yeah
B	like everything's so sexualised
C	yeah but like
B	but also some people are just like that from a younger age
C	yeah
C	also I think like if you're
B	mm
C	and just really used to saying things in front of adults then maybe you would just say
B	yeah yeah yeah
C	like what's in your head cos probably you're
D	slightly weird
B	yeah it's
B	no I know she doesn't
C	she she like she doesn't know
B	I mean she doesn't she wouldn't know how crazy inappropriate that
C	yeah yeah yeah yeah exactly like if you were seven or nine or whatever it'd probably be
B	which I'm not
B	you know I'm not
A	look at that baby
C	you're the one asking a little girl around for sleepovers
B	that's true I did give her a lot of wine
C	get some give her some rom coms to butter her up
C	ply her with Haribo
B	yeah I think she er she she's just quite
C	I
B	yeah it's different
C	just in terms of
B	just the sheer volume of like media as well
C	yeah and how you're it's impossible to be er protected and I think I was protected quite a lot I mean but not even intentionally
C	just cos the society protects children
B	mm
C	or it did at at that
B	mm
C	I can't imagine what it's like it'd be fucking crazy
B	I also think like her mum's really attractive and like quite
C	yeah
B	how that beauty and that femininity affects people
C	yeah yeah yeah
B	and like you know
C	for sure
B	she'll she'll have noticed that and absorbed it and she also
C	definitely
B	is like very pretty used to like getting a lot of attention and compliments
C	yeah yeah
B	cos she's like she must just be like so fucking like fascinated and ready for that
C	yeah
A	yeah cos
B	yeah what? who?
A	yeah or like cos I remember everyone all everyone trying to hit on my mum like when she was just getting petrol and stuff you know
C	yeah yeah and and like if you imagine how that if er if you were a girl what what would that make you think about?
B	I remember
C	ah
A	you're a handsome woman
C	ah pretty and handsome
C	that's sweet?
A	what?
B	only
C	you're so pretty and so handsome
B	so handsome
B	it's cute right
C	so pretty and so handsome
B	huh yeah
A	what? she said that to
B	yeah
A	not to you
B	no she said it to
A	oh man
C	so pretty and so handsome
B	mm mm should put white wine on it babe
C	what have you done? spilled red wine down your white T-shirt?
B	put mustard on it babe
C	yeah it must be so confusing
B	mm
B	but in a way like it is how the world is
C	yeah
B	and it's like you know it's a bit sooner but I don't think that's too much for someone to take on and like I er I mean some er like friends of people I've known like talk about like being really sexually aware from a really young age
C	yeah
B	I think it's also just like
C	yeah yeah no for sure I just think that like erm in my mind that
B	mm
C	like whoever that may be
B	yeah
C	which is actually much closer than you think but
C	yep
B	when she was a kid she er she was she was like well up for it
C	yeah
A	that one?
C	no no no no
C	no not my youngest nephew the younger brother of my from my other er nephew's and he's like
C	and cos his er his older brother is really like beautiful and and and and very social and everybody basically gives all the attention to him
B	mm
C	cos he's ginger and like just really vocal and you know and and the little brother's basically ignored and so he just fucking trashes like trashes everything
B	mm
C	cos that's the only way that he gets
C	any attention and it's so obvious but like as soon as you see the two of them you can tell you can tell exactly what's gonna pan out and then they and then they fulfil it in every single way
A	yeah it's like
C	and all the adults around them totally fulfil that that that whole like everybody knows what their role is and it's completely fulfilled and every box is ticked
B	mm
A	yeah it's like Horrid Henry and Perfect Peter do you remember reading those books?
C	yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah exactly
B	which one were you babe?

C	yeah
D	people having a set time of not drinking cos it's like
C	not not very many people do it
D	no I
B	yeah in the same way you're jealous of people that or one might be jealous of people who do yoga every day
D	exactly it's that sort of thing
C	yeah
D	that's the slight jealousy it's not like it's not like wow they're so disciplined it's like
D	yeah
B	the Chas and the Dave
D	the Chas
D	the Chas
B	I saw him last night he came smelling a bit weird at the party
D	who?
C	he smelled the what?
B	he
B	invite him to this party cos it was at
D	oh
B	and
B	he really doesn't he really doesn't like him erm but anyway er he wasn't that bad he was just standing around and just going what's your format? what you doing then?
D	yeah
B	what? he was like I'm doing this like
D	yeah
B	this is it three AM
B	I'm doing this
D	three AM fair enough question
C	what's your format?
B	what's your format? he asked me like five times what my format was I was like
D	yeah I'm meant to be seeing him tomorrow
B	ask me another one
D	see him in the afternoon for a few hours
B	I might I do I do quite wanna see him soon I you know I've learnt to
D	yeah funny one
B	because he was like really being like I think he was
D	no he's dead worried about what you think of him
B	he's dead worried
D	mm
B	he's dead worried
D	he's dead worried yeah
B	oh really?
D	yeah
D	he is a dick but we accept we're like I think we all know he's a dick
B	I know I know
D	like
D	whether or not you can be bothered with him is the other question like
B	it's not even really
C	whether you wanna go to bed with him?
D	no no no like he's a dick but
B	like like you can't you
B	really can't invite him to anything
C	I'm a hundred percent done I'm a hundred percent done
A	how come? he used to hang out with
B	yeah I think even
C	even
B	fucking what a mess
B	but er
C	really?
B	I think or like maybe not shooting up on the train
D	no probably like
B	shooting up is a separate thing but like
C	well probably I wouldn't be surprised
B	getting like doing heroin on the train like by himself in the toilet that's quite bad I reckon do you reckon that's bad?
C	that's really bad
D	yeah yeah
B	I dunno anyway I'm gonna see him
C	I think I think if you were to say something to him it would er be good
B	heroin?
C	yeah but just
B	I know like
D	he doesn't care what anyone thinks though
C	but I think but the thing is
C	I think he he like builds up what he he
D	yeah
C	because you've like kept him on on hold for a while cos he's been
D	he's a he's a
C	you know what I mean?
B	bad man
C	just like just like
D	no no
C	no because because
B	yeah I know I don't
B	he won't change though you know
C	no but it seems a bit like at the same time it's either like
B	yeah
C	and it's like one or the other and I'm and I would just like I'm done I'm not gonna tell him unless he asks
C	I'm
D	yeah but you yeah no no I was just I was er just saying the third option
B	but what's your what's your
C	just hanging out with a dick
D	I was just saying the third option
B	ah
D	er I can explain like my
C	yeah but he's really rude
D	yeah but he's also like a friend
D	like with plenty of flaws but who is like I think genuinely a good person
C	okay well that's yeah that's your opinion I disagree
B	I think I'm obviously more in the middle like I I I don't know if I don't know if honestly I think that he's a good person but
D	I think he has fucking shitloads of flaws
B	like I think when it comes down to it if he can get away with it he does like you know
D	yeah he's also like er like if you hang out with him sometimes it can be way better than hanging out with other people
B	yeah
D	cos he's not that
B	but the then that's I guess what I was gonna say I don't really think at the heart of it that he's a good person that's not why I like him but there is
D	no it's more the fact that it's quite funny to hang out with him
D	yeah you're right no it's not cos he's a good
B	he's kind of a friend in a way and er you can have lolz with him I dunno yeah on balance it's a bit fucked but I will I will see him and like
D	yeah
C	working yeah
B	like when he's sober and he's like totally like
D	yeah the same with us as well
B	great to have around
C	he's the best he's a hundred percent best
B	yeah
D	we met him working at
B	funny like makes it like fun just like I thought he was a really cool guy
C	and you have that glimmer of like like you and you see the like brilliant side of him that no one else really sees
B	yeah no one sees
C	no one sees that
B	like which I didn't even figure out till much later it's like oh shit you're like that all the time to everyone else
C	yeah
B	I thought it was just you know I caught him on the odd bad night but yeah like
C	what? at Lapland?
B	like no before at
C	yeah
B	mm
C	like I find it a bit like like I don't know I don't know why I have to give him any more slack
B	I guess like I wouldn't give him another chance
A	don't give him any more slack
C	just like totally done totally done
C	yeah yeah I guess I guess I
C	yeah you're right I guess I've I've probably never really consciously had er any friend who who I would
B	mm yeah it's definitely a weird one
C	er I I just find it
C	and I and I
D	no I don't think that's the case because er it's not inexcusable the things he does people don't talk to him he knows that people don't talk to him he gets upset about it
C	yeah but I think the only reason he gets
B	if he could away with it he would
C	pardon?
B	if he could get away with it he would
C	yeah exactly that's that's the thing and er and I and I understand that everybody has their bad side and like you know we could all be fucking horrible if we wanted to I just don't like
B	I wanna try it
C	yeah
B	I wanna see how far I can push it
C	yeah
D	how horrible can you be?
