A	I
B	yeah?
A	but I never wore it
C	right
B	didn't you? no?
A	well
B	oh right yeah
A	and have it sort of the
B	yeah
A	rub I mean they get a little Dremel
B	yeah?
A	and just sit there grind a bit off where it hurts
B	oh right I've got one of them
A	and er erm
C	mm
A	every time I wore it it it's got one tooth that is sort of clipped on this tooth at the back and er it was sort of initially excruciatingly painful
C	mm
B	was it?
A	to clip on but then it settled down and then I could wear it but the next day I always had an ache in that tooth
B	mm
A	so then I thought oh well it's interfering with something
C	right
A	so I won't wear it for a couple of days till the tooth is better and then I put it in again
C	yeah
A	then it happened again
C	yeah
A	and then I'd leave it three or four days then
B	yeah
A	now and now I just I got this sort of ache in this tooth which comes and goes
C	oh I see
A	and it's like er an exposed nerve
B	oh I see
A	you know it's not it's not like er a toothache where it
B	no
C	no
A	sort of like blows up
B	no
A	but it's just like
C	mm
A	a really bad exposed nerve where
C	right
B	yeah
A	you know really gets you and er
C	so you haven't been back since?
A	I haven't been back since
C	mm
A	I'm sort of
C	yeah
A	a wonderful thing you know
B	mm
A	having a full set of bottom teeth again and er no it's just a pain in the butt
C	mm
B	well he's told me that it's best to have a top set than a bottom set cos the bottom sets never work
A	never work?
B	no they they
C	why not?
B	you haven't got enough gum left
A	mm
B	because
C	I thought it was better
B	it gradually shrink away you see your gum
A	I don't know I don't know what
B	and they told me they don't work
A	mm
C	mm
A	but they work alright when you're chewing on something
B	yeah what I'd like to have is erm titanium
A	implants
B	yeah
B	they're about three thousand quid
A	mm
C	what a tooth?
B	probably
A	yeah I know they're supposed to be good though
B	mm
A	are these all the same?
C	no they're erm just cheese
A	mm
C	and they're cheese and Marmite
A	oh right
C	cream cheese and Marmite mm
B	anyhow eh I've gotta go Wednesday
A	mm
B	to have the first
C	it's a few Wednesday's yet
A	first fitting?
B	mm
C	mm
A	oh that's a bit have you had it done before?
B	no
A	oh that's a bit of a
B	is it?
A	they get this sort of stuff and it's a bit like Play-Doh
B	oh right
A	right?
A	but more sticky
B	oh
A	and er
B	yeah
A	that size right? and they stick it in your mouth and they said right bite on that and like mm like that and it goes everywhere
A	and then
C	gotta set hasn't it?
A	to set and er then they sort of
A	and a mouthful of stuff
B	oh crikey
A	and
B	go on put me off
A	and then they sort of peel it off you know
C	mm
A	how they do it and then they say right that's it and you're only there for about ten minutes
B	ah
A	then you go back after a couple of days and
B	yeah I gotta go back three
A	and then they do another one
B	mm
A	and then they
B	yeah
A	which is supposed to match your mouth
B	that's it yeah
A	well the inside of your mouth
C	mm
A	and then they can make this denture
B	yeah
A	fit the
C	mm
B	yeah
A	cos the worst thing is I found cos cos the one I had it's sort of was shaped to clip cos it was only a part thing on the back it was sort of
C	mm
A	shaped to clip on the bottom of your front teeth
B	mm
A	you know and then the sort of the plate sort of not very big plate but it sort of goes back and then there's sort of it sort of clips on the back teeth and er you think well that ain't very much you know but it just it's in your mouth you know
B	yeah
A	you it's sort of like a lump in your mouth
C	mm
A	all the time
B	mm
A	and your tongue gets caught up on it
B	yeah
A	cos if you think about it like
B	mm
A	when you're talking
B	yeah
A	your tongue is just constantly going
B	course
A	to and fro on the
B	yeah
A	on your bottom palate
C	yeah
B	yeah that's right mm
A	it's constantly going to and fro as you talk
B	yeah
A	and er cos there's a big lump there and it's sort of like a ridge which isn't much
B	yeah
A	but it feels like a ridge about an eighth of an inch thick you know
B	well it's like anything yeah yeah if you get an ulcer er in your mouth that feels oh it's a that's a great big
A	mm
B	carbuncle but when you look it's just a little tiny white spot or something like that
A	mm
C	mm
A	but then I think they give you all this sort of information on Fixodent which I think
C	right
A	you know cos cos they say oh wear it for a while and then your
B	yeah
A	gums get used to it
B	that's it yeah
A	and then you this Fixodent which is like
A	yeah it's sort of er a gluey sort of stuff
B	a soft glue mm
A	comes in a tube like toothpaste and you you know put it on the bottom of the dentures and on the denture then push it down then it sort of sets it and holds it there apparently very effectively
C	is this a bit like the stuff they put in your mouth er in the beginning?
A	I don't know what erm
C	mm
A	could well be sound a bit similar but then you know you have to sort of clean it off every day
B	do you? oh
C	oh
A	well I think so otherwise your teeth are stuck in
B	oh of course they are yeah
A	and they don't recommend
A	leaving your teeth in er
B	no they don't do they
A	overnight
B	no
A	so it's just like er you know another thing on the weekly shopping bill
C	mm
B	yeah
A	you know
B	oh yeah
C	now you're really worried aren't you?
A	but it's worth it for the experience I tell you
A	well they might work I mean I never got mine properly fitted it's not
B	no
A	that was where I went wrong because I got this one tooth at the back
B	oh yeah
A	which it clips onto
C	mm
A	and I got a feeling there's something wrong with that tooth anyway
B	mm what's it? a wisdom tooth?
A	mm
B	is it?
A	it's the only one I got left on that side
B	yeah
A	at the bottom
C	yeah
A	no er the reason I got dentures is I thought well if I lose any more teeth I'll need something to
B	yeah
A	to be able to eat on or to chew with
B	yeah yeah
A	cos I've got
C	yeah
A	not many left now on the bottom
B	no I ain't got hardly any on the bottom I pulled em out myself
A	mm
A	mm
B	and that was a dentist in in
A	mm
B	I went down there and I had this
A	mm
A	mm
B	well
A	well some of em are quite tricky aren't they?
C	mm
B	yeah but he didn't he didn't go through you know they go under the gum with with erm
A	mm
A	mm
B	didn't he?
C	mm
B	and he said that'll be thirty bob please and I said you're a bloody butcher
B	I did
B	went lairy went back to
A	but dentists nowadays are so much better than they were in the old days ain't they?
C	mm
B	oh yeah
A	you know I mean
C	yeah then he wouldn't go after that you see
A	mm
B	no I wouldn't go again
A	well you go nowadays and there are all these
B	yeah I go now yeah
A	all these young people straight out of dental school
C	mm
A	you know keen
B	yeah
A	got all the latest equipment
B	yeah well we went
C	well we we'ren't that keen on the one we got
B	not er the one but we went to the
C	we had a brilliant one from
B	in
C	when we first went to
B	called Dr
A	dunno
B	he was a Chinese bloke and he was fantastic weren't he?
C	yeah sorry I thought I heard
B	oh
B	there's a
C	mm
A	mm
B	yeah he was a fantastic dentist
C	yeah he was good and that convinced him that it's okay to
A	mm
C	go to the dentist again
B	aye like that
A	where do you go now?
B	we go to one in
[ANNOTATION]	It is scary to go to the dentist.	Neutral
C	mm
B	cos er he shut down
[ANNOTATION]	His last dentist was a good one.	Entailment
A	mm
B	the one in
C	oh we had a really bad one in
C	yeah it was it was their practice and
A	yeah yeah
C	we had the other one
A	they were rubbish weren't they?
C	oh terrible absolutely awful
A	they're the ones who pulled all my teeth out
[ANNOTATION]	It is hard to find a good dentist.	Neutral
B	yeah?
C	yeah yeah
A	well it was er no actually well they did erm root canals and they
B	yeah
A	that didn't work and then they pulled me teeth out
B	do you want any more
A	yeah well I'll have one in er
B	and there's ordinary other cheese cos if you don't eat em they'll be gone in a second
C	oh I didn't give you a knife you can have a knife if you want it?
A	no no it's er but I erm go to the
C	where's that?
B	yeah
C	so that's in
A	yeah opposite the old iron works
B	oh right
[ANNOTATION]	That is a great dentist.	Neutral
A	on that one way bit
B	yeah?
[ANNOTATION]	There are no dentists.	Contradiction
A	and er
B	yeah
A	but she's been there quite a while now
B	mm
A	and she's you know she's you know very friendly and very good
C	mm
B	no I'd better go and have this out this broken one
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	The dentist is nice.	Entailment
B	cos er well it's only er it's only a shell now
A	mm
B	I gotta have it out Wednesday and then er immediate plate stuff or whatever you now told me they put in your mouth
A	mm
C	mm
A	well it would've been a lot worse fifty year ago
C	yeah
B	well yeah no er the school dentist
C	scary
B	used to just put just pull em out
A	mm I know
B	and that's why half the people at our age haven't got any teeth they just pulled em all out my mum and dad never had teeth
A	mm
B	I've never known em with teeth
A	never had any problem without teeth
B	but I know my mum said she fell in love with him when he looked up at her and smiled and he had wonderful teeth but when he got into the army they pulled em all out
A	well that's the first erm reaction weren't it to bad teeth
B	yeah
C	mm
A	but it's very strange that they say that nowadays the erm you know like people eating so many sugars and all this
B	mm
A	and how terrible it is and er and how bad kids' teeth are but kids don't seem to have
C	mm
A	as bad teeth as we had
B	yeah
A	when they said we had a perfect diet
B	yeah
C	that's true
A	sort of after the war you know
C	yeah
A	they said oh loads of vegetables and no sugar
C	that is true isn't it?
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	but everyone I know er
C	yeah
B	mm
A	it's like when they used to come round and the school dentist came round
B	mm
A	you know
B	yeah
A	everyone had to have fillings and stuff didn't they?
B	yeah they did or pulled out
C	mm
A	but I can't understand that when they sort of running on about it's how such a wonderful diet it was
B	no
C	yeah
A	and you know they sort of you know
B	that's true I've never thought of that
C	yeah
A	I mean teeth need calcium don't they?
B	yeah
A	so they can't say anything about that cos they used to give you free milk
B	yeah they did didn't they yeah
C	they did
B	we used to
A	used to drink a third of a bottle of milk
B	third of a bottle a day and I used to be milk monitor
A	which nowadays they reckon that
C	mm
A	er you know you shouldn't drink that much
B	that's right yeah
A	you know it's bad for you
B	I used to be milk monitor
C	we're a great believer in milk aren't we?
B	yeah
C	mm
B	and er
A	mm
B	we used to have loads of milk over cos kids didn't
A	no one'd no one'd drink it would they
B	well it was a funny taste one
A	well it weren't no it was in the summer when they'd been standing there and
B	yeah it's all been standing there all day
A	standing out in the sun all day
B	yeah
A	weren't so good was it but that was full milk wasn't it?
B	mm full cream milk that was yeah
A	mm
B	I remember the first time that got pasteurised though cos we used to have our our dairy in
A	mm
B	full of milk where the where the
A	all the flies coming round it and
B	and a and a great big wooden paddle
C	getting warm getting warm
B	and he always used to say you make sure you stir that milk boy
B	so you'd go in there and scoop er scoop the top off first and then
A	mm that was a treat the first bit weren't it? the cream off of it
B	yeah
C	mm
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	and
C	it's all gotta be pasteurised now though
A	eh?
B	it's all
C	it's all got to be pasteurised hasn't it?
B	well when it was first pasteurised
B	I hated the stuff
C	homogenised
B	yeah I thought that was horrible stuff cos the Co-op was the first to pasteurise the milk weren't it?
A	dunno
B	yeah they used to have the Milk Marketing Board down er I think it was the bottom of
C	yeah it was
A	oh
A	mm
B	both together I reckon they must've been colluding
C	at college we used to get
A	I think the Milk Marketing Board
B	no
C	mm yeah at college we used to get all the foils after they stamped out the milk bottle tops
A	oh right
C	we used to get all them and put them up for the dances
B	we used to put em er
C	always went and fetched it
B	we used to er
C	er made a beautiful
B	stick holes in em and hang them
A	right
C	the actual tops yeah yeah
B	the tops the foil tops
C	yeah
B	but the first tops we had were cardboard tops and they were wide milk bottles like that
A	mm
B	and just the milk bottle but they were wide cardboard tops with a blue tip
C	mm
A	well I can remember my dad used to be a milkman
B	oh yeah he did
C	yeah
A	and er a lot of people'd only have a half pint of milk
B	yeah?
A	and when there was a shortage of half pints
B	yeah
A	half pint you know
C	mm
B	yeah
A	so then he could make the he used to do that at home
B	yeah
C	right
B	well there you go
C	so how does they're stuck how do they stick them on cardboard tops?
B	well just just
A	well they er they just pushed in
B	they just pushed in
C	oh I see inside?
A	the inside the the neck was sort of recessed
B	yeah
C	right
A	with a lip and they just went you pushed em in onto the lip
C	that's it yeah mm
B	yeah and they had a little tab to pull em out
C	oh
B	yeah
A	did they?
B	yeah they had a little tiny tab where you could
A	are you sure they didn't have a little hole which you used to push your finger right in and pried em out?
B	oh that yeah
A	yeah
B	and pulled em out that's right yes
C	mm
B	and I remember
A	or stab em with a knife
B	go
A	and that was in the days when people used to sell well not slightly afterwards but er you know
B	yeah yeah
A	or tinned everything they
B	yeah
A	never had any tin openers
B	no
B	that's right you had to stab em didn't you? yeah
C	mm
A	and then they brought out them sort of
B	them them ones that
A	yeah
B	punched a hole in it didn't it?
C	mm
B	yeah
A	that's right yeah in the winter
B	used to dig er dig holes in em and oh the blue tits used to get em and mum and you'd finish up
A	there must've been a lot more blue tits about in those days
B	yeah there must've been because
A	you know it was a
B	yeah they must've been everywhere
A	you couldn't er you couldn't you know couldn't leave a milk bottle out could you?
B	no you couldn't
B	well if you did
B	yeah
A	a bit of wood or put em in a box you know just sort of really tedious
B	that's it yeah
A	delivering milk
A	had to remember and if you forgot you know cos we didn't
A	go round every
C	mm
A	or something and you know
B	I bet they got went up the wall
A	you'd be there with your dad he'd say right two pints at that house remember to put it in the box or two pints at that house put a slate on top

B	no Corona bloke didn't come back no he didn't last long
A	mm
B	well how can you buy a bottle of Corona every week?
C	guess some did
A	well there was
A	must've been all started after after the sugar rationing come off
B	yeah
A	must've been
B	yeah
A	cos they wouldn't have been allowed to sell em
B	well they used to be three pence for the bottle and we used to go round people's
A	that's right yeah collecting bottles
B	and collect the bottles and take em up the shop and get the money
A	mm
B	that was lovely used to tell em it was for the Scouts

B	yeah yeah
C	yeah
A	but
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	yeah we do
A	and I sort of collect it all up and I sort of think that can be recycled that can be recycled and I never actually get round to recycling
B	no that's right you just get
C	mm
A	and I know what in the end what will happen is I'll
C	mm
A	you know
B	bin it

B	that's it yeah
A	he must've been worth a fortune
C	mm
A	actually when you think about it
C	yeah
B	yeah that's right and er
C	mm
B	he'd still collect scrap and he'd still go around people's collecting scrap
A	yeah?
B	he
C	mm

B	have you got anything for me? no
C	did he?
B	yeah
C	oh
B	oh well I don't want him making the money he's got millions
A	yeah but it makes you wonder how they operate cos they're supposed to have a licence and everything
B	they are yeah yeah
A	if you go round collecting scrap
C	mm
A	it's only like household householders
B	yeah
A	taking your rubbish down to the tip
C	mm
B	yeah that's right yeah
A	that's the only thing er
B	yeah
A	everyone else has gotta have a licence if they collect it
B	yeah
A	and they've
C	mm
A	a licence for disposal of waste haven't they?
B	yeah yeah is that yours that sandwich?
C	no
A	yeah I think it is

B	that was really funny cos my dad did everything for my mum everything you know cos he
A	mm
B	she was crippled with arthritis
A	mm
B	and when he died that was like she got a second life
C	well she had to do it that's the difference
A	mm
B	and she had to do it

B	yeah
C	yeah
B	yeah we go round and see her occasionally
C	we went we went to see her well we just called in cos we hadn't seen her for a while had we?
B	no
C	we
A	er she was in hospital?
B	yeah
C	she yeah she was in hospital then
A	what with?
C	er a girl
B	she fell over
C	lives nearby she came running over and said oh she's in hospital
B	mm
C	hadn't been for a while but she was out again when about two days later wasn't she?
B	mm
A	mm
C	she'd just fell over and
B	we went and saw her again
C	so we went to see
B	but she
C	yeah
A	mm
B	all the time she never gets out of the chair unless
C	mm
B	she had to go to the loo or whatever
C	well she doesn't actually go to bed anymore
B	and she's got this huge electric er radiator ain't it?
C	mm
B	which is plugged in wires go right across the floor all over the place
C	yeah er it's quite dangerous really
A	mm
B	and it's plugged in
C	you know trailing wires everywhere
A	mm you'd think like must be some
C	yeah
A	social visitors go there
B	mm
C	well
A	you'd think they'd pick it up wouldn't you?
B	you'd think they'd do something
C	well yeah
A	mm
C	but she's she's such an independent lady
A	mm
C	and we've often said to you know we've got erm we had some phones that we
B	yeah
C	you know those ones you walk around with even
A	yeah
C	right? so she never answers the phone
A	mm
C	because she's in the living room
A	mm
C	it's just
B	she can't get to her bedroom
C	it's but it's one of those old-fashioned phones that it's erm wired in isn't it? you know just an ordinary phone
A	yeah but you could get er a length of cable couldn't you?
B	yeah
C	yeah but she wouldn't have
A	and straight yeah for like well I think for a quid in the pound shop you can get a massive great reel of cable phone cable
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	and then she couldn't get her television on she couldn't get it working
C	yeah
B	she'd pulled the plug out and switched it off took the aerial out
C	she takes everything out each time you see so
A	mm
B	and forgets she's done it
C	but it's dangerous to keep
B	yeah
C	getting down and doing it all again
A	mm
B	but to get down there that's why she fall over
A	yeah
C	and she has got one of these new one new televisions cos they had to change over didn't they?
A	mm
C	and erm so she's got all the controls switch it on and off all the time
B	we get it working for her again
A	mm
B	and she'd say are you sure that's right?
C	er
B	you know I don't want it to go wrong you know
A	mm
C	it was just after the erm changeover
A	cos that cos it attracts the lightning you know
C	yeah
A	unless you
A	pull the plug out
A	yeah that's right
C	we got in on for her again we had to had to reset it you know
B	we got it on for her and she set she er you know how to switch it over well I don't I don't switch it over I just have that one on
C	cos when
B	just that one and that's it
C	and when she first got it she'd only had it in black and white
B	yeah
C	cos she'd never had a colour television before
A	mm
C	then she'd only have one of these little set little tiny black and white
A	what she sort of like setting on er black and white?
B	yeah no yeah she said
C	she did but now now she's realised it's it's okay
A	oh
C	she can have colour
A	oh right yeah
C	but
A	mm
B	well I think colour television you had to pay a bigger licence for colour television
A	you did yeah
B	than you did black and white you see
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	and she probably didn't want that
C	she's a lovely lady though she is lovely
B	yeah but she she's she's forgetful now and
C	yeah
A	drives you mad
B	yeah
C	she did she
A	well I mean that's like
B	yeah?
A	you know you say about she just spends all her life in a chair
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	and er you know she's got this horrendously expensive electric wheelchair the sort of thing you can go driving down the road in sort of thing
B	yeah
C	ah
A	but it's actually a wheelchair as opposed to a buggy
B	yeah
C	mm
A	and with a like hand control
B	yeah
A	and it cost an awful lot of money and er it's just sitting in her room and she never used it or she never used to use it and er
B	oh I see yeah
A	or you know what about if I tipped over or something er like that?
C	yeah
A	the chances of her I mean she don't even used it to go round the home
B	no
A	or to go into the garden
C	no
A	and all this sort of stuff
B	oh dear
A	and er but recently cos er her
C	mm
A	she's getting so bad at walking
B	yeah
A	you know she used to sort of shuffle
C	right
A	to the loo
A	you know with a on a
B	on a
C	yeah
B	what do they call em?
A	now she's found it's a lot easier to just shuffle into this electric chair and drive herself to the loo in it
B	yeah
C	mm
A	you know?
B	yeah
A	so she actually does use it
C	yeah
B	oh I see
C	it's
A	you know it's a er they're quite big things
C	yeah
A	but they're so manoeuvrable you know erm could turn em
B	yeah yeah yeah I've seen em
A	on a sixpence
C	mm
B	yeah
A	you know what I mean?
B	yeah
A	and er
C	mm
A	it was because you know it's you know when people get old
B	well they get ripped off don't they?
A	they get they get conned something ridiculous
B	they do I
B	and
A	well this was second hand right?
B	yeah
A	and it was still cost something like fourteen hundred quid
B	well that's ridiculous ain't it
A	which you know you can buy I saw a woman in a bus with er with one of these scooters which was did exactly what hers did except it was half the size and more manoeuvrable and er brand new they we're only about eight hundred quid
B	yeah
A	and she was charged something like fourteen hundred quid second-hand for this
C	mm
A	thing
B	that is ridiculous ain't it huh?
C	yeah
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Person A think it might be seems ridiculous	Neutral
B	they do they get ripped off
A	well it's like when she had this erm stairlift put in you know they the council paid
B	yeah?
A	well she got some sort of grant to pay for
B	yeah
A	half of it and it cost
C	mm
A	something like three thousand quid and er she only had it for about a year

[ANNOTATION]	Person B is going to dance	Contradiction
A	eighteen months then she moved er you know couldn't get
C	mm
A	couldn't get about at alright?
B	no
A	so to sell the house they had to take it out
C	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Person C  was followed by the guy was taken picture by him	Contradiction
A	oh what's the retail value of this? ah it ain't worth anything cos you know it's especially designed
C	mm
A	to fit round there and it you know we'll give you like two hundred quid for the actual chair
B	chair
C	mm
A	and the rest of it weren't worth anything
C	mm
A	you know and you think hang on a minute they're gonna
C	mm
A	they're gonna reuse all that stuff
[ANNOTATION]	Person A said that can use them again	Entailment
B	yeah course they are
A	it's like Meccano you know
B	yeah
A	I mean you get the straight bit you get the
B	yeah
A	you get the
[ANNOTATION]	Person A is going to have a sandwich	Contradiction
C	yeah
A	finishing post you know and the chair
B	yeah
A	just goes up on a gear you know
B	they do try and con you these people don't they?
C	yeah
A	well they don't try
C	yeah
A	they do
B	they do con you yeah but er
A	yeah
B	well they con the older people don't they?
A	mm
C	mm
A	when you think you know it's you know everyone's gotta make a living but I mean these people are rip-off merchants
B	well they're they are rip-off merchants
A	yeah
B	there there's a programme called Rip Off Britain have you ever seen that one?
A	yeah no I haven't no
B	there's er well that was on this morning but we didn't see it but I mean that is all about people more or less getting in and conning older people
A	mm

A	yeah
C	mm
B	someone'll go round and say cor your you got bad tiles on your roof and things like that
A	yeah
B	and they go oh have I? he said yeah I can do that for you er it'll cost three hundred pound and they say oh will it? he said you'll have to pay up front
B	so she pays up front and he goes up there and says oh I can't do it it's it's really really bad
A	mm
B	you know but luckily at that time her daughter went round
A	mm
B	and said
A	mm
B	you know and want and wanted another thousand
A	yeah
C	mm
B	and they don't care
A	yeah I mean
C	yeah
B	it do
A	and they just don't care do they?
B	no no
A	and in fact that they sleep quite comfortably cos they got a
B	yeah
B	and they ruin
C	mm
B	people's lives haven't they? I mean
A	yeah they do I mean little things
C	mm
A	it don't take much you know if someone's sort of worry about things like that do it?
B	no no well my mum she she lived by herself in
A	mm
B	disappeared
A	mm
B	and and he was he was about forty years old
A	oh really?

B	they found her handbag up the road with everything but the money
A	mm
B	well she didn't have Barclaycards and all that in them days
C	mm
A	yeah
C	mm
A	you've got the bad with the good haven't you?
B	yeah you have yeah and luckily there I think there's more good than there is bad about
A	I think there is
C	oh yeah
A	but the trouble is that the
C	there is
A	you know a hundred times something good happened you don't really notice it
B	no you don't
A	and then the one time something bad happens it sort of causes quite a
B	yeah
C	it does yeah
B	that's like the teenagers in in
A	yeah
B	you know people people are really frightened of em half the time aren't they?
A	yeah
B	and then they got a little teenage front up haven't they? that one er they go round old people's and help em out
A	oh really?
B	yeah and this girl says oh she was
A	mm
B	and she said er well everyone think because we stand around under a light or whatever outside the fish shop that er we're bad and they didn't want don't want to walk
A	yeah
B	talk to us
A	well people have been thinking that
B	well we felt the same
A	since the year dot haven't they? exactly you know I mean
B	yeah
A	when you
C	mm
A	any time
B	yeah course they are
C	yep
B	I mean we we had the police come down
A	mm
B	down
A	yeah
B	the next time he come down he come down with a dog
B	I mean a police I mean they
A	yeah
B	and and they treat you like criminals and you're just standing around laughing and joking and having
A	being raucous and
B	yeah
A	noisy and
B	yeah probably
A	yeah
C	mm
B	and you
A	revving your motorbikes up and
A	shouting and screaming
B	oh yeah well
C	that's scary
C	that is
B	yeah my mate brought his Veloset down and he he had a
A	oh right
B	right? he had a Vincent thousand the other one had a Veloset I had a BSA Bantam
B	but er you know they
A	mm
B	and say cor yeah or this that and
A	yeah
B	the other and
A	and it just reverberated round
A	and er
C	yeah
A	he'd obviously gone down there and didn't realise it was a cul-de-sac you know what I mean?
B	oh right
A	and he so then he had to turn round at the bottom and come out again
A	but I was walking along there and I'm thinking oh I'm so annoyed you know?
A	that I'll stop him and tell him that it's like not on you know?
A	making so much noise
B	a grumpy old man
A	and then I thought oh god that was me when I was young
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	well we got a young boy come past erm going in the morning and at night as well he's got a sewing machine that he drive you know what they're like you know?
A	mm
A	mm
B	they're going and they're doing about twenty-five to thirty mile an hour
A	mm
B	and there he is like this
B	that killed me that do
C	mm
B	and you know I think well
A	well even they you know even them they're usually quite quiet
B	yeah
A	you know what I mean?
B	yeah that's right yeah
B	that's right they do yeah
A	yeah just to
A	sound as though
C	mm
A	they're really powerful
B	sound as though they're really powerful and really fast
A	mm
B	and he come past there every day
A	yeah
B	and it make me laugh when I see him cos he's got his head down like that
A	yeah getting the last
C	yeah
A	scrap of speed out of that
C	enjoying every minute
A	yeah exactly I er
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	I did exactly the same
B	yeah
C	mm
B	yeah
C	mm
B	my brother dropped me into this well I only had a motorbike once and er he had this great big old thing that was a BSA but that was a big old BSA
A	mm
B	I don't know what it was
A	mm
A	no no no
B	he's coming down the road like
B	you know coming down
C	Easy Rider?
A	who?
C	Easy Rider?
A	no no erm
B	no
A	you're thinking of Marlon Brando
B	Marlon Brando
C	oh right
B	him yeah going down the road like this and he comes
A	the
B	round the corner and I'm standing there near old gate and he went whoop and run over my feet don't he
B	and
A	did he fall off?
B	that's the sort of thing they
A	mm
B	but I think that we used to have them big old not Doc Martens but they were they were work boots
A	mm
B	you know they er they come up my ankle and you that didn't hurt but the he thought it was so funny he did
C	mm
B	yeah and then he er he used to get outside
A	mm
B	now that that's another thing I've got about people on motorbikes
B	right?
C	mm
A	uhu
B	they come past you
A	mm
B	and they're they're having a good time and then they look down at whatever it is they're looking down at why do they do that? have you ever noticed em?
A	they look down? no
B	when you watched these bikers that come past you
A	what sort of bikes are they riding?
B	well all sorts of bikes decent bikes you know
A	and you reckon they look down?
B	they look down to see they just
A	no I've never noticed that
C	mm
B	ain't you?
A	no
B	well I've noticed it every time every time they come past
B	yeah
A	and they're looking down to see if there's any oil
B	they these these
A	something like that
B	yeah
A	but I mean on a modern bike
C	mm
A	most people never put a spanner on em so
B	no they don't do they? well they're not
C	mm
B	I think there's only one bike who British bike now ain't there is a Triumph? or is it a Norton? one of the two
A	well Triumphs have
B	yeah
A	the name up and build some sort of bike
B	yeah
A	but that's you can still buy a Norton yeah I think you can still buy an AJS but that's
B	yeah
A	run by an Indian company
B	yeah that's right yeah that's right
A	and you can still buy a er
A	they're made
B	they're
A	mm
B	and there were Ariel come up remember the Ariels?
A	yeah I had an Ariel
B	yeah?
A	but they erm I got a feeling that there's some I think you know there's another you know what they do they buy all the components from China
B	that's it yeah
A	and put a
B	yeah yeah
A	and er I've got a feeling there's a an Ariel about
B	yeah?
C	mm
A	but it's nothing to do with the original companies you know
B	no
A	but Triumph are doing well
B	they are doing well yeah yeah
A	you know they make these sort of big prestige bikes
B	yeah yeah
A	and apparently they sell
B	they're quite a lot of money too
A	and that was quite good because that's this company who bought out the old Triumph
B	yeah
A	and er sort of started off just making replacement parts and stuff like that
B	yeah
A	and then sort of slowly er had er one bike and then got some money from somewhere and redesigned the whole system
B	yeah
A	the whole
B	yeah
A	different engine you know these three different engines but nearly all the parts were interchangeable like the pistons the rods
B	oh I see
A	the cranks
B	they're all the same yeah
A	and all this stuff so that they don't have to make loads of different bits
B	no that's a good idea
A	like you know and things like starter motors and
B	yeah
B	mm
A	in all their models
B	mm
A	whether they still do that now or not I don't know but that was er sort of the money saving idea that they had
B	yeah when did the first
A	what the starter motor?
B	yeah well
A	I mean they had em in the war didn't they?
B	did they? I
A	what are you talking about? on a on a bike?
B	yeah when you
A	oh I'm talking on a car
B	oh well no I'm talking about bikes
A	oh on motorbikes?
B	yeah
A	probably when the Japanese models first came over
B	oh yeah
A	that would have been in about
B	yeah
A	early sixties when the Japanese models when the bigger bikes
B	mm
A	bigger Japanese models come over
B	that's right yeah yeah
A	cos that was all quite amazing weren't it? they had electric-start
B	yeah that's right
B	yeah yeah the old kick-starts
A	and their early ones they had kick-start and electric-start didn't they?
B	yeah yeah well you had a kick-start and electric-start didn't you? on on that one that you had up here?
A	no no
B	I'm sure you did
A	I just had electric-start
B	that was electric-start? but there was a kick
A	what the red one?
B	yeah there was a kick on it as well weren't there?
A	no no
B	weren't there?
A	no
B	oh
A	it was just electric-start
B	oh I thought I saw a kick-start on it
A	no no no
C	mm
A	that's why I was a bit dodgy about hoping it was gonna start
B	that's right er yeah you were weren't you?
A	mm
B	yeah
C	yeah do you want a cup of tea now or do you want to make the most of
A	I'll have a cup of tea now
C	okay
B	did you?
A	yeah well miss out then
B	missed out a cup of tea
A	mm
C	disappeared
B	yeah
B	ah
A	oh well
B	well
C	who?
B	did she? oh
A	no lives in Hong Kong
B	in Hong Kong right
A	cos and the reason she's didn't come back to have the baby because she wanted the baby to have dual citizenship with China
B	oh I see yeah yeah do you know there's a lot of people do that now?
A	why?
B	I don't know I mean
A	why would they
B	that's right
A	Chinese citizenship
B	no well
A	yeah
B	they had the baby's birth at the same time
A	yeah
B	but that's what one of em come back to Edinburgh where she lived
A	yeah
B	so she could get British citizenship and Chinese
A	mm
C	and she's thinking ahead her Scottish so you don't haven't to pay for university that's
B	yeah you don't have to pay if they're born in Scotland they don't have to pay for
A	yeah tuition fees
B	tuition fees
A	that's it
B	but that that's a long while ahead though ain't it?
B	yes
A	but I don't understand why these this couple wanted to have dual nationality
B	no
A	cos they're doing the same thing when
B	are they? yeah
A	well what is she doing? is she?
B	English teaching English yeah
A	yeah that's
B	no
A	but erm that's what they're doing in er Hong Kong
B	yeah yeah
A	and do you know what they called the baby boy?
B	oh don't tell er
A	I was saying to
A	why's that? I said well if you're a
B	oh dear oh dear
A	no honestly
B	well that's right I mean
B	yeah probably still he could
A	mm but then I was sort of thinking about it and I was thinking I'm sure that's a
B	yeah
A	isn't it? I'm sure of it
B	and to be a er
A	well er
A	that was his middle name
C	yeah
B	what are you looking at?
A	I just sort of noticed that sort of dome thing you got
B	oh that's a that's a load of wood that a friend of ours
A	oh yeah
B	and er and he's put a
C	covered it up cos of winter
A	just to keep it nice and damp inside
B	probably yeah so it'll stink like hell when you when
B	yeah
A	mm
B	yeah
A	the thing with wood is you've gotta keep the air flowing through it
B	you have yeah yeah
A	but then his wood his
B	mm?
A	but then you say his wood his
B	that's right yeah that's his wood but they do come along and cut all my
A	oh really?
B	yeah
C	yeah when they heard you were going into hospital wasn't it?
B	yeah
A	I thought you were gonna say they come and they cut all that
B	no
A	so you can burn it
B	that would weren't it? yeah
A	yeah
B	then then I'll attack it with a chainsaw I think that's the only thing I can do I can't
A	mm
B	I can't chop it
A	no
B	I'm not going to chop it probably get a few slices off of it and that's it you know
A	well that's right I mean the thing is it's getting to the stage where you know you sort of quite appreciate the challenge but then er you're gonna do your shoulder in or something
B	that's right yeah
A	or do your back in
B	yeah
A	that's a long while
B	that's a long while healing ain't it? yeah
A	healing up and getting
B	yeah
A	mm
B	there as well so they'll burn up this year
A	yeah
B	anyway cos that's I dunno how long ago was that?
A	a couple of years ago
B	a couple of years now yeah yeah
A	it's gonna be reasonably dry
B	yeah well that's good underneath that thing anyway and that's
A	mm
B	nice and airy faces west sort of get plenty of plenty of wind and sun
A	yeah
B	that should be alright
A	ah I've decided to go er to come down and trim some trees out of
B	yeah
C	mm
A	oh biscuits eh?
B	biscuits as well yeah we've gotta have biscuits
A	mm
A	oh lovely
B	thank you
A	break time
B	yeah
A	only just had teatime lunchtime
B	yeah well I mean you gotta have em all at once you see
A	but old
B	has he? what's?
A	well
B	well he fell off his bike
A	yeah well he
C	mm
A	he fell off again not so long ago
C	really?
B	really?
A	well he luckily he fell on the other shoulder so
C	oh gosh
B	oh no
C	oh
B	well he shouldn't should he?
A	no and with clip-ons
B	oh what?
A	you know they have
C	oh no
A	these things where your your feet are actually clipped to the pedals?
C	yeah
B	clipped to the pedals yeah
A	I mean
C	oh you're stuck aren't you?
A	I mean he's daft isn't he?
B	well he's gotta be ain't he?
A	well that's oh I'll have to tell him next he said I said you wouldn't go think of going motocrossing with your boots glued to the pegs
B	no you wouldn't would you?
B	yeah
C	mm
B	well that's a bit silly ain't it?
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	but I mean all he had to do was
B	yeah
A	ain't he?
B	that's right yeah
A	and then er he ain't pegged up anymore so why?
B	no that's right
A	you know it's not hard
B	I
C	no
B	clip the shoes into the pedals
A	mm
B	why do they do it?
A	it's so you can pull the pedals as hard as pushing it
B	yeah but I mean that's that seems a
A	extra power
B	that seems so daft to me
A	mm but then he bought he's gotta make erm he had his winter project to make four chairs right?
B	yeah
A	cos you know he
B	oh I see yeah
A	well he made himself a steamer and
C	mm
A	he made a you know he got the the table with all the pegs in
C	yeah
A	and he actually made in last year he made himself a bentwood chair
B	oh right
C	yeah
A	you know where you steam the wood and you bend it round the frame
C	mm
B	yeah
A	and then when it dries out it stays bent
B	stays where it is yeah
A	and er so he had this erm you know he'd he'd done it all last year or whenever and he was gonna make four of these chairs and try and sell them and
C	mm
A	and so he spent two hundred quid on buying all this all this wood for these chairs already cut and machined you know they're sort of like little
C	yeah
A	sort of thin
B	yeah
A	sticky bits that are all gonna be bent and er
C	mm
A	so he he started doing that and er stuck em in his steamer mm didn't seem to work very well so he he bought a new yet another wallpaper
B	yeah
A	to provide more steam you got these immaculate sort of like long box what he's made lined with you know insulation and stuff like that and
B	yeah
A	which the steam goes in the wood all and er so he improved that so he got more hot hotter and er that didn't work and then he chucked all his wood in his pond so it got you know
B	wet yeah
A	wet
C	mm
A	and then tried it again
B	really soaked yeah
A	and er he went alright sod it heated it up as much as he could got it out slapped a bit on this thing and it just went snap
B	oh no
C	oh
C	oh
B	did it? oh
A	and er he's tried a couple of times
B	cor I'd've loved to have been in there and heard the blue air
A	he tried that a couple of times and er he just can't get this wood to bend
C	mm
A	and er
B	yeah it should yeah
A	and so why isn't it working? and after much searching and on the internet
B	it was cutting the wrong grain I suppose
A	no it wasn't it was cos it was kiln dried
B	oh
A	right?
C	oh
A	once you kiln dry wood below a certain moisture content you get this chemical change
C	yeah
A	in the wood which is irreversible
C	right
B	oh right
A	and that's why stuff like furniture don't move about
C	yeah
A	and it's all made with kiln dried and
B	yeah
A	then once it's kiln dried you know the moisture isn't gonna affect it at all because it's
C	mm
A	chemically set
C	right
B	oh it's like sealed as well ain't it?
A	that's right yeah
B	yeah
A	and so no matter how much you steam it
C	no
B	nothing'll happen to it yeah
A	you'll never get you know it's still gonna be
C	yeah
A	brittle too brittle to bend
B	yeah
C	mm
B	oh I see
A	so he's now ended up with like a sackful of all er
C	yeah
A	two hundred quid's worth of sticks
C	ah
A	which he but then the other day
C	well he he can do something with them
A	well this is what I said I said you'll have to make a straight chair or something with em
B	yeah
C	mm
A	and he's spent a couple of days devising a new design where he's
C	yeah
A	at least he can use some of it
B	yeah
C	mm
A	but he said he was making this chair and he had all his clamps out and sort of clamping it and
C	mm
A	it was like making something out of matchsticks
C	oh
B	well I bet
B	what?
A	it don't get a signal
B	well er
C	he can take it back can't he?
A	well he has
C	right
A	the new one
A	which is on EE
C	mm
A	right? the old one is on Vodafone and the old one no signal at all or the new one no signal at all the old one full signal and er
B	weird
C	mm
A	I said to him take it
C	oh yeah
A	you know cos they've got some sort of super hyper thing there in
B	yeah
A	and but he's been round
C	yeah
A	and er you know you go er
B	so
A	there's no signal at his so he can't use it
B	can he
C	no
B	what what if he put his SIM card in his old SIM card in it?
A	well he tried that
B	did he?
A	and er he's even
B	oh right
A	so this means he thinks
C	mm
A	there's something wrong with the phone
B	with the phone yeah
C	mm
A	but
B	that worked at the Carphone Warehouse
A	it works in the er Carphone yeah exactly well I'd have thought he'd he would have kicked up a bigger stink
B	well yeah er
A	rather than coming and moaning to me about it I mean
B	yeah
A	cos he actually bought it
A	he actually bought this phone
C	mm
B	well they're quite a lot of money to buy ain't they?
A	it's a Samsung
B	oh is it a
B	yeah
A	so and they
B	and they're brilliant phones
A	yeah well
B	yeah
C	mm
A	but it's got but I tell you what we were
B	yeah
A	carry on this road you know sort of talking to you it's like a satnav
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	you know and it's just like a free thing you got with it
B	yeah it's brilliant ain't it
A	and er you know and you're driving along and it's such good it's like as good a
B	yeah?
A	you know it pinpoints you exactly
C	yeah
B	brilliant
A	you know and like
C	mm
A	you know and er this was marvellous and considering it was
B	and that's the old one
C	yeah
A	this is the the first sat er Galaxy they ever brought out
B	yeah well
A	before it even had numbers
C	mm
B	yeah now it's about up to Galaxy five ain't it?
A	I think so yeah
C	mm
A	but I mean that just the just have it for that navigation thing is worth having
B	yeah yeah
A	well
B	yeah? oh right
A	and
B	yeah
A	SIM card
B	yeah
C	yeah mm
A	but I think she actually pays ten pound a month now because she likes the the extra you know
B	the free the free texts and the free phone calls you get
C	mm yeah
A	well that's right and er all that sort of stuff she get
B	yeah
C	mm
A	cos she found she was spending about ten quid a month anyway
B	I think we used I've I've used my phone about twice
C	not a lot have we? yeah
B	that's just that really we bought it just for us
A	mm
B	to communicate when
C	mm
B	we're out you know when we're er separated
A	yeah well that's right yeah I mean I mean I still haven't got a mobile phone but there are occasions when I do find it would've been useful to
B	yeah yeah
C	mm
B	but saying that
C	most people have
B	I never take mine with me
C	well I did make you sometimes
B	you do make me when I er
C	mm
B	oh oh right yeah mm
A	but my house phone I don't
C	mm
A	hardly ever use the most use I get for that is
B	well that's like us
C	can you get?
A	can you come can you come and do?
C	yeah
A	something's wrong here can you
C	yeah
B	yeah we only get get
C	well we we try to do it just at weekends and evenings
A	mm
C	phone calls to people
B	yeah
A	well that's right
C	and you can bet your life if we say oh we'll phone up
B	you forget
A	mm
C	we either fall asleep or something happens
A	that's right
C	and oh
B	I just sit in the chair and fall asleep
A	but it is so expensive to use the phone ain't it?
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	you know
B	I
A	yeah
C	I phoned my brother he's just round the corner isn't he?
A	uhu
A	mm
C	obviously it went onto his I'm not here kind of thing
A	mm
B	his answerphone
C	I don't know how it went on in four seconds but it
A	mm
C	that's what it says on the bill that's twenty-four pence
A	mm
C	cos it was in the morning
A	yeah but they they have a connectivity charge don't they?
C	yeah
A	every time you connect up it's sixteen pence ain't it?
C	mm
B	it used to be five pence
A	yeah
C	I presume that's
B	no
A	but it used to be sort of five pence a minute didn't it? and
B	yeah and five pence a minute
A	mm
B	that's right yeah
C	I wouldn't have said that connected in four seconds cos
B	no
C	it's usually ten rings isn't it?
A	perhaps that's once the er the answer phone kicks in
C	yeah
A	from then it's four seconds
B	yeah
A	while you listen to his message while it's
C	oh it might've been
B	mm
C	yes
A	it hasn't been yeah
C	you're probably right actually
B	well we could phone next door and that's thirty odd pence
A	yeah
C	but you think mm
B	I walk round there now and talk to em
A	but this
C	mm
A	see this is the thing I mean they're what they're do gonna do you're you're on BT aren't you?
B	yeah
A	well what I'm on Talktalk and what they're gonna do is they're gonna put the prices up by a couple of quid a month but
B	oh do you? yeah
A	right it only costs an extra three quid
B	yeah
A	and I'm thinking well I never use it but that's like a couple of phone calls
B	yeah
A	during the day isn't it?
B	yeah
C	mm
A	it'd be three quid
B	yeah
A	you know and but what they're gonna do is they're gonna put it up another couple of quid
B	yeah
A	but you're gonna get free phone calls to mobiles
B	oh right
C	oh right
B	so you can phone mobiles now?
A	yeah yeah
B	yeah
A	cos at the moment I have to pay for mobiles and
B	yeah
A	or you have to pay another three quid a month
B	yeah
A	to get free
C	yeah
A	access to mobiles
B	that annoyed me when
C	no we hadn't thought about
B	you you get these erm firms that they
A	mm
B	that you can get in touch with
C	no just have mobiles
B	just phone their mobile
A	then you have to phone their mobiles and it
C	mm
B	yeah
A	costs you don't it?
B	yeah
C	and some 0 eight hundred numbers are not free
A	aren't they?
B	no they're not no
C	no so be very careful
B	then the 0 eight four numbers are even more expensive
A	mm
B	the the 0 five some five three three I think are free they've changed it all round without
C	mm
B	without sort of letting people know
A	yeah
B	you know
C	mm
B	if you go on the net you can get all the all the information
A	well this is the thing ain't it you know
C	mm
A	it's like I was it's sort of like you know if I could be arsed
B	yeah
A	to go onto Talktalk you know and my account and
B	yeah
A	look at all the figures and that you'd find it all out but how often do you do that?
B	well that's right
C	mm
B	you don't do you?
A	never unless you're really bored and you can't think of anything else to do
C	well I only did it the other day cos I wanted to know broadband how much
B	oh yeah how much broadband cos we're we're on the we're on the basic tariff you see
C	cos we're we have gone over several times
A	yeah
B	and if we go over
C	and you watch too many videos you know little clips of anything
A	yeah mm
B	Youtube downloading things you know
C	or even Facebook little bits and pieces
A	yeah
C	it
A	yeah
C	it adds up quite fast
B	so then you go over and that cost
A	well you you're limited on your bandwidth or not your bandwidth your your
B	yeah
C	yeah we've only got ten
B	we're limited to ten on our download
C	yeah
B	stuff
A	you wanna get Talktalk
B	yeah?
A	cos they are unlimited
B	are they?
C	yeah
A	and I'm getting something like twelve megabits a second at the moment
B	are you? yeah
C	mm
A	although it does drop at certain times
B	yeah yeah
A	but I didn't realise BT still restricted you
B	oh yeah
C	well we can get the unrestricted one but we'll
A	oh I see that's more expensive
C	pay a bit extra
A	yeah
C	another
A	but I'm paying
C	three pound a month
A	even though I pay extra for this daytime phone call I'm still paying less than I ever paid in my life
B	yeah?
A	for broadband you know when dial-up came in and
B	that's it yeah
C	yeah
B	that's that's true
A	you had all these deals and then it got cheaper
B	yeah
A	and then cheaper for this and cheaper for that
C	yeah
A	et cetera et cetera
B	yeah
A	and like with Talktalk as well I pay erm the line fee twelve months in advance
B	oh right
A	which works out a couple of quid
B	cheaper yeah
A	cheaper a month
B	yeah
A	then er on top of that I pay something like eleven quid a month
C	mm
B	yeah ours is
A	which is like unlimited broadband
C	yeah
B	yours is unlimited? and we pay
A	and unlimited phone calls
C	mm yeah
B	we pay about fifteen pound a month don't we?
C	mm I think so
B	and we're limited to ten gigabytes
A	mm but that soon goes nowadays don't it?
B	yeah that do if you want
C	it's usually alright
A	mm
C	isn't it?
B	cos I like I like to watch er bits and pieces learning bits and pieces on Youtube
A	yeah
B	it's very good
A	well that's right yeah
B	any anything you want to learn
A	yeah
B	go onto Youtube
A	I was
C	yeah
A	looking at erm how to put a front headlight in a Volkswagen Beetle
B	oh right yeah
A	a couple of days ago
A	god I mean that's a it's erm
B	yes yeah
A	who lives in France she took her car into
B	yeah
A	and it failed on the fact that the driver's door the automatic locking didn't work although it still locked on the key
B	oh right
A	right? and the headlamps were a bit dim you know like the
B	yeah
A	the plastic was a bit hazed on em like
B	oh I see
A	and I think they cost the best part of a thousand pound to fit them
B	what?
B	oh what a rip off
A	well that's right these headlamp
B	wow
A	or the best part of that I'm sure they we're something like that
B	and they just go hazy did they?
A	well the the plastic on the outside
B	yeah
A	it sort of like go hazy it's like ours on our car it's exactly the same it looked gone a bit cloudy
B	yeah
A	and er
C	mm
A	we got round it by putting extra powerful light bulbs in
B	yeah
A	cos they measure the lumens right?
B	yeah that's right yeah
A	and er
B	crikey
A	and the door lock you know was
A	and I looked I looked on the net
C	yeah
A	and you can buy brand new headlamp units for something like sixty quid each you know after market ones
B	wow
C	yeah
B	yeah yeah
C	mm
A	and then I thought I wonder how
B	well we went we got
A	erm and er with er for the Beetle
B	yeah
A	there was two clips you er undo the main locking clip undo the holding clip wriggle it a bit and it just slides out
B	yeah
A	and it comes out and it's so easy cos if you wanna change your bulb you have to slide the headlamp out to get to the bulb changing bit
B	oh right
A	so it's that easy right
C	mm
B	yeah
C	mm
B	well we went to Halfords just a couple of
C	mm
B	and ask em cos er we got one
A	uhu
B	daylight running lamp just stick in a bulb come out can't do it have to have to go to the garage
C	mm
B	they can't put the bulb in
C	too difficult to get to
B	too difficult for em to get to
A	mm
C	mm
B	so it's gotta go to the garage and it's nothing to do with MOT or anything it's just
A	it would fail nowadays it'd fail the MOT
B	that would yeah yeah
C	oh yeah
A	all lights have to work
B	yeah
A	all warning lights all
B	yeah
A	every light has to work
B	and it just says the
C	yeah
B	day the daylight running lamp
C	well we thought we can keep it going till
A	is that er do you get a message up did you?
B	yeah
C	yeah every time you get in the car
B	every time you get in the car it says
B	check daylight running lamp
A	and is it off at night?
C	its been about
A	have you
B	it's off yeah
A	mm
C	it's been
B	yeah
C	mm
A	should be done under guarantee I should think
B	it should've been shouldn't it yeah but they don't do lamps do they?
C	no it would've been
A	but you have to have it
B	yeah I've gotta have it erm what's it called?
C	it's December isn't it?
B	yeah yeah December
A	ours is er coming up mid
C	wait until then
A	mid November I hate having an MOT at that time of the year
B	oh yeah
C	yeah
A	you know cos if you don't fix anything it's sort of cold and wet and horrible
B	yeah
A	not in the summer you know it's sort of
B	yeah
A	got more
B	you'll have to bring it down there and put it under your under the thing
A	yeah
C	mm
B	well you you can do that can't you?
A	yeah I would do yeah
B	yeah
A	but last last year it failed on the exhaust pipe and you know it's where the pipework come
B	yeah
A	goes into the the main can
B	yeah
A	and all the back of that had all rotted through that
B	oh I see yeah
A	so I had to
B	yeah
A	but the back of it had all rotted through so I had to put a get a new one
B	you couldn't weld it up?
A	no it's you know it had gone completely
B	yeah
A	and plus the fact is that
C	mm
A	you know you can get these aftermarket exhaust bits for next to nothing and like
B	you can yeah yeah
A	like go to Kwik Fit and it's like oh that's a hundred quid
B	yeah
A	and you go online and it's like twenty-three quid delivered
C	mm
A	and anyway I got this bit back had a hell of a job
B	putting it on
A	taking it to bits cos you're sort of like on your back and it's like this far away
B	yeah I know yeah
A	and but it's sort of like a bit of a challenge you know what I mean
A	anyway I'd just connected it all up put it on but then I noticed that where it joins like the the the the erm
B	yeah
A	you know
B	yeah
A	and this pipe has got a flared end
B	oh I see yeah
A	where it fits
B	yeah
A	together and then you put a clamp on
B	and then you clamp it up
A	and of course this pipe come along at the flared end half the flare had all rotted away as well
B	oh crikey yeah
A	so I sort of put it together and filled it all up with Firegum and er it passed last time but this time I think you know over the course of a year all that sort of filler and that has probably fallen out so it probably needs
B	yeah it's probably got too hard and
A	yeah
B	the the the rust has let it go too
A	but the
B	yeah
A	I could've bought the whole length you know all three bits
B	yeah
A	like the end that bit that middle bit and the bit at the front for about fifty quid
B	oh
A	which I should've done you know
B	yeah
C	mm
A	I really should've done put it all together but
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	now if it that middle bit goes I've gotta take it all to bits again
B	you gotta take it all to bits yeah the lot has gotta come off ain't it?
A	but luckily there's no erm catalyst on it
B	ain't there?
A	no luckily cos the new ones have got them catalysts in them ain't they?
B	they've all got catalyst converters ain't they?
A	yeah and they've got erm particle filters as well
B	have they?
A	in diesels
B	oh in diesels they would have wouldn't they? yeah
A	yeah
B	now I
A	mm
B	going up the road he put his foot down and absolute spewed out black smoke down the bottom
A	really?
B	yeah
A	they shouldn't do that should they?
B	no absolute black that was as
A	yeah
B	terrible
A	well you do get that with diesels as a if you really
C	mm
A	hammer your foot down
B	yeah
A	it blows out black smoke but a modern one should have all these filters in and everything
B	that's right yeah yeah but this one that was a brand new one
A	mm
B	as well I mean
A	yeah
B	you're talking about forty thousand quid for these
A	more than that I think
B	are they?
A	yeah I think they're about fifty-six
C	yeah
B	are they? yeah well
C	mm
B	and that well that that just come across the road and
A	yeah
B	I mean that choke you as well if you're following the road behind em sort of thing cos you you got your inlet air coming through haven't you?
A	mm
B	fill up the car with filthy diesel
A	that's right yeah
B	yeah
A	but modern cars have filters on their air intake don't they?
B	they do yeah yeah
A	I expect they've got a
B	if you ever remember to change em
A	you've got a pollen filter in yours haven't you no doubt?
B	mm yeah well I did have in the old one in the in the
A	oh yeah
B	yeah that had a pollen wish we'd never got rid of it
A	but I expect this one when that comes clogged you'll have like all the dash'll light up
B	yeah
A	warning yeah
C	mm
B	then you can see it
A	well I'm quite amazed that I'm er even on our old car that warning back door left open
B	yeah that's right
C	mm
A	you know
B	no seatbelt on that tell you if you haven't
A	mm
B	put your seatbelt on
C	mm
A	does it?
B	you get in the car turn it on and it go checking
A	mm
A	so how how does that handbrake work?
B	the handbrake? I got no idea
A	it's a
C	just go click
A	it's an electric handbrake isn't it?
B	it's an electric handbrake you go
C	no
B	no
A	no? so you stop on the hill
B	and you've got a hill start
C	it's
A	yeah and what and what
B	automatic hill start
A	automatic?
C	cos
B	yeah automatic hill start
A	so you don't have to do anything?
B	no
B	yeah
C	mm
A	must have some sort of tilting sort of
B	it must do yeah
A	and so that
B	it says hill start help that's what come on
A	mm
B	hill start help and off you go
A	and what? and so you stop at the traffic lights on a hill
B	yeah
A	you take your foot do you take your foot off the brake?
C	your foot's no your foot's still on the brake
B	yeah
C	in the beginning isn't it?
B	yeah
A	huh?
B	yeah
A	oh yeah
B	take it off it says hill start help
A	but you don't roll back?
B	no
A	and so you're sitting there it's does it cut out when you stop?
B	no no
A	no some do don't they?
B	some do yeah
A	so you're sitting there it's ticking over lights change and you just push the accelerator?
B	and off you go
C	mm
A	and off you go without sliding back?
B	yeah
A	jesus wept
B	it's amazing er
A	that sort of things that are great until they go wrong
B	probably yeah
C	yeah
A	and then you get the bill how how much it costs to fix it
B	yeah
B	yeah yeah
A	cos on something like that you wouldn't
C	oh I suppose you you could you could put the handbrake up now
B	you could put the handbrake on
C	you could do it
A	you have actually got a handbrake have you?
C	well that's that little little click
B	well not a handbrake you got this little button that go
C	it just does
C	erm
[ANNOTATION]	Someone will have to pay for a service.	Entailment
A	this button
C	just
B	whether it
[ANNOTATION]	The button is blue.	Neutral
C	where the driver bit is
B	that'd probably work on the
A	no where's the button when you're sitting there
B	the button is right next to you
C	yeah
A	so it's just sort of where the handbrake normally is
B	yeah
A	you just press the button?
C	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Speakers talk about car equipment.	Entailment
A	and what? you push it down?
B	yeah
C	no pull it up
B	no you
A	oh pull it up?
B	yeah you
A	and then what?
B	that just go
C	but it doesn't pull
B	electronic handbrake
C	it doesn't actually pull up it just
A	and do you get any warning? a beeping or something?
[ANNOTATION]	Electronic handbrake is easier to control than simple handbrake.	Neutral
B	you get a warning that your handbrake is on
A	oh right
B	just a little light saying
A	so then do you if you want to drive off do you have to let it off or?
B	no
A	or maybe it goes up?
C	no
[ANNOTATION]	The handbrake light is yellow.	Neutral
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	jesus
A	that's incredible ain't it?
B	that is
A	you know when you think about it
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	The handbrake is in a 2010's car.	Neutral
A	but then I suppose it's all done electronically it's not as though you got
C	mm
A	cables and levers and things
B	no you got no cables and levers have you? no
A	it's all done like the computer does it don't it?
B	all solenoids and stuff I suppose yeah
A	and I suppose it just works out that
B	yeah and it just let you go
A	and it just lets it go
B	yeah
A	but it must check that you're in gear as well otherwise if you just rev the engine up
B	oh yeah you yeah
B	that don't move
B	no it's very clever
A	mm
B	we we haven't found out everything yet have we?
C	no
B	there's so much on this trip computer
C	we need to know erm cruise control we haven't worked that out yet
B	we haven't found the
A	I think that's weird cruise control
B	yeah
A	just means that when you're on the motorway you can just like take your foot off the throttle don't it?
B	that's right and go at seventy mile an hour
A	you just click it
C	it won't do any more than seventy
A	no
C	yeah we've got one a warning haven't we?
B	yeah we got a warning you were exceeding yours
C	he put he's put a warning on
B	you're you're exceeding your speed limit
A	oh really?
B	yeah
C	so we've done that bit
A	has it got a built-in satnav then?
B	no we got no satnav but that must must have something to do with it with er
A	well
C	yeah nothing to do with satnav does it?
B	no it's nothing to do with it
A	yeah but I mean what I'm saying is when you're in a thirty mile and hour limit does it warn you?
B	no not unless you not unless you put
C	no no unless you put cruise control
B	you put it through the say you can do thirty
C	that would
B	that'll keep you going thirty and er if you exceed it
A	yeah but I mean you're saying that
B	if you
A	mm
A	yeah but I mean they could do it with satnav couldn't they?
B	they could yeah
A	on a on a warning thing
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	cos like they warn you you know
C	they could
A	when you're in town they know where the thirty mile an hour limits
B	yeah
A	and forty miles and
C	yeah it flashes up red doesn't it? if you're going over
A	mm
B	yeah
C	our does
A	on a satnav?
C	on a satnav
A	oh right
B	yeah
C	so it well it it lets you have about
A	yeah
C	three over I think and then it comes up red
A	yeah
C	and flashes and that's
A	that's good though ain't it so
B	yeah
A	kind of
C	er you you don't always watch it do you? so
A	eighty quid to go to a bloody speed awareness thing
B	oh yeah you did didn't you?
C	yeah but doesn't er always take any notice
A	yeah but it's so easy
B	rubbish you're sitting there saying
C	you don't
B	you're sitting there saying huh it's thirty
B	yeah okay
C	yeah I think you're doing seventy-five
B	oh
C	okay I can't go down anymore
B	just following the traffic that's all you're doing
A	mm
C	but it's going flash flash
A	well when we went into London last time we went in on the A12
B	yeah
A	then it's basically er erm
B	yeah that's right yeah
B	yeah?
A	through these high streets and that so I never bothered to go on it before
B	no
A	cos I thought oh that's that's always
C	mm
A	a bit tedious anyway this time I thought I'd try it out and you drive along the M11 to the North Circular
B	yeah?
A	you know you got your go under the M25
B	that's right
A	get on the North Circular soon as you're on the North Circular you got this sort of fork to the A12 you know a slip road
B	yeah
A	go to the A12 big roundabout head towards London and I tell you what it's like a glacier has been through London
B	yeah?
A	yeah it's just dual carriageways have been blitzed right through the centre of London
B	wow
A	right? it's all the way as far as Blackwall tunnel and you go underground some bits you know and
B	yeah
A	but this
C	mm
A	massive great wide road but that's sort of fifty you know so you have
B	yeah
A	to watch it cos I mean you could do and it goes past the erm
B	does it? yeah
A	and stuff like that
B	yeah
A	so you can see all the Olympic park there
C	mm
A	and it sort of goes round there but what a brilliant road
B	is it?
C	yeah
A	and how much must that have cost to build?
B	well did they er destroys houses and villages and stuff?
A	they must've done like I say it's like
C	mm
A	a glacial valley you know
B	yeah
A	you're driving along this road and there's sort of walls up there and there's people up there you know sort of going about normal life
C	mm
A	a few overpasses then you go in the tunnel and
C	oh
A	you come up again and it's sort of like everything in its way has been demolished
B	that used to be a
A	it did it used to be like traffic lights and god knows what
B	yeah
A	and the
C	mm
A	all the high streets used to go to through it didn't they?
B	yeah yeah
A	but like I say now I mean I've never
B	yeah
A	as far as the A3
B	yeah
A	and then go in on that road cos I knew that was a fairly good road
B	yeah
A	but this one's just
C	yeah
A	just incredible
B	do you know I used to have to go down to London nearly every week to the community what do they call community place?
A	mm
B	where we pardon?
B	yeah community
A	mm
B	I really don't because I used to have to go down the A11 and then on the North Circular somehow I
A	yeah well I when er
C	and you hate London don't you?
B	and I hate London yeah
C	yeah
A	when I lived in when I used to live in London all them roads like the A11 the A12 the A13 I used to know em all them like the back of my hand
B	yeah
A	you know cos I used to sort of
C	mm
A	drive up and down em
B	well course you did yeah
A	so often you get to know em don't you?
B	yeah
A	and er but they all disappeared now
B	yeah
A	all been blitzed into
A	dual carriageways
B	yeah
A	and er you know there was always
C	mm
A	massive great roadworks along a certain proportion of it
B	yeah
A	but now it's just like
C	yeah
A	all the way ain't it? almost
B	it's amazing ain't it?
C	yeah
A	mm but you know this A12 that was the other thing I can't even remember hearing anything about it being built
B	no
A	and it must've taken
B	years
A	tens of years
C	mm
A	you know
B	yeah
A	to do that and the cost
B	yeah
A	billions of pounds
B	yeah
A	I mean it's true what they say about that you know London gets all the money spent on it
B	yeah
A	and when you look at this Crossrail thing they're building
B	oh yeah crikey
A	I mean that's going from Heathrow all the way to sort of er you know Dagenham or somewhere like that
B	that's right
A	or Barking you know
B	yeah
A	so right
C	mm
A	and then they're gonna build another one Crossrail two
B	yeah
A	which is gonna go from Woolwich and then up north as far as I dunno where
A	and when that but you know
B	is it that high-speed rail they're building?
A	no this is this sort of like
B	no that one's going to Birmingham ain't it?
A	this is like the Crossrail is this sort of like
B	oh I see yeah
A	to link everything up
B	yeah oh we watched them building the underground the other day
A	mm
B	do you have you seen that?
A	yeah it's quite fascinating ain't it?
B	oh wow this huge huge tunnel
A	mm yeah
B	grinding I mean it's a massive massive machine
A	yeah
B	and that's just going round grinding hole in and they're pushing this this big er concrete er tube
A	that's right
B	behind them
C	mm
A	well I mean that's how the Channel tunnel's built ain't it?
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	well that was quite a feat ain't it? when you think about it
C	isn't it?
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	five millimetre out by the time they
A	yeah
B	they met each other
A	that's right
C	mm
A	but I mean it's quite amazing really when you think of these construction projects and
B	cor it is nowadays ain't it
C	mm
B	when I was a boy we had to dig holes
B	with a spade
C	had to go underwater
A	I I had the chance of er
C	mm
A	you know working on the er Dartford tunnel
B	did you? yeah?
A	cos there was one already there and they were putting a second one in right? and er at that time there was quite a lot of er discussion going on about bone disease caused by people working under compressed air conditions so er
B	oh right
A	and er because it was under the Thames right?
B	yeah course it
A	they had er it was sort of all the air in there was compressed air
B	yeah
A	not much you know but it was er above atmospheric pressure
B	yeah
A	and I said to this guy
C	mm
A	you know there's you know these sort of er airlock things
B	yeah
A	cos it's like
B	getting the bends
A	getting the bends
C	mm
A	exactly
B	yeah
A	and you get these
C	mm
A	bone these er air bubbles form in your blood
B	that's right yeah
A	which then attack your joints and stuff like that
B	yeah
A	he says you know your blokes can stay in there for half an hour if they like but most of em don't bother they just
C	mm
A	wanna get home
B	well
C	mm
A	so I didn't take the job
B	no
A	I thought oh yeah well er
B	yeah well
A	that was before the days of health and safety
B	yeah yeah
A	although health and safety was not on construction site was still there but
B	that was there but the
C	mm
A	everyone used to ignore it
B	turned a blind eye to it didn't they?
A	yeah
B	I remember we had a bloke come change our aerial and he had to drill a hole in the wall strap his ladder to the wall
A	mm
B	er go up with harnesses on didn't he?
C	yeah
B	all this stuff on harnesses and what have you
A	mm
B	and all that the aerial had fell down
A	yeah
B	and
A	it makes it makes you dread you know having a high wind and er er the
C	mm
A	a tile blowing off your roof
A	you know
B	that's right yeah
A	you know half a dozen blokes all
B	yeah but the best one that was
C	and we
B	they said bloke come from Northampton to do this job that was his only job he had that day
A	bloody hell
B	forty quid
C	mm
B	to put the aerial up
A	cor
B	forty quid weren't it
[ANNOTATION]	Person B doesnt think that person A is right	Entailment
C	yeah
B	we couldn't believe it
A	mm
C	mind you we put it up in the first place
B	yeah we put it up in the first place
[ANNOTATION]	Person B think that is would be better to put it in the first place	Entailment
B	but I don't go up ladders anymore
A	mm
C	we had scaffolding up but
B	we did mm
C	we had er a loft ladder then to get to the
B	to yeah we had we had a loft ladder to get to the chimney and put it up and er wrapped it round the chimney
C	er which is a flimsy little ladder it really is isn't it?
B	yeah well you know what a loft ladder is like that bent
C	oh dear was scary
[ANNOTATION]	Person C doesn't have a good feeling for it	Neutral
A	I remember when erm er we were doing my mum's house up to sell it and er on the north wall it'd all been painted black right? you know they used to tar it?
B	yeah
A	painted black tar on the north wall and we you know had chopped sort of extra windows in so it was a bit of a bloody mess and
B	yeah
A	on top of this black but it was sort of you know
B	oh he died did he?
A	he's dead now yeah
B	yeah
C	mm
A	and he was happy as a lark you know
[ANNOTATION]	Person A  think that he was as a joke	Neutral
B	yeah
A	and he used to like ladders cos he'd worked as a window cleaner
B	oh right
A	on you know commercial property and he had had erm absolutely no fear of heights at all
A	and er
B	oh
A	so
[ANNOTATION]	Person A think he doesn't scare about falling down	Entailment
B	yeah I know what you mean yeah
A	he built a little tower with these scaffold frames about six foot high stuck the ladder on top of this tower
C	right
A	you know? and er propped it up there and it just reached so he could reach with a brush just to get the
C	oh wow
A	and this thing was sort of like
[ANNOTATION]	Person A think he is strange	Neutral
B	I got stuck up the ladder I did didn't I
C	mm
B	I was up this ladder and my legs went like jelly
A	mm
B	and they were shaking
B	and put one leg down
A	yeah
B	ah
A	well sometimes it's right you
C	mm
A	if you get up the ladder it's alright as long as you don't think about it
B	yeah
C	yeah as soon as you do
A	but you know you do suddenly sort of like you sort of grip the ladder
B	that's it that's right that's just how it went
A	and you can't you can't go up
C	yeah
A	you know and you have to sort of like really make yourself
B	and you you have to make yourself do it yeah
A	yeah yeah
B	yeah and I that's what I do now
A	yeah
B	I'll still climb a ladder don't I?
C	mm
B	in fact I gotta
B	clean out all the all the gutters now now that autumn's nearly finished
A	mm actually my
C	mm
A	the other day there's another job I've gotta do cos er
C	yeah
A	my new gutters there's blooming grass growing out of em
B	yeah
A	and I know why because when they it was on this sort of the bottom one er well there's one there and then one there and when they first put it up they'd obviously put that end too low
B	yeah
A	you know cos you could see like the tiles and if you got a lot of water that'd overshoot you know what I mean?
B	that's right yeah
A	and it wasn't and and he said oh I'll fix that and then he fixed it so it had gone up but what he'd done he'd just lay rose that end so you haven't gotta
B	ah I see yeah
A	you know so the water holds in the gutter so any bits of
B	that'll stay there
A	mud and that and and grass grows and er you know it all
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	before you know you got a wildlife garden up there
C	yeah
B	yeah that's right we we got one
A	yeah
C	yeah we have haven't we?
A	mm
B	you know where the valley we got a valley going like that down
A	yeah
C	oh
B	and that's that's come down and there's a great big lump of grass growing there
A	mm
C	mm
B	that's just growing out of
A	the trouble is the more you know once it starts going it collects more and more stuff don't it?
B	yeah course it do yeah
A	you know cos all the roots
C	yeah it makes its own compost doesn't it?
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	mm
B	I got up there once I made this great big long pole
A	mm
B	and I had to sort of balance it so it went up and then
A	mm
B	I could pull some of it down but that that er still got stuck that's got stuck in the two valley gutters like that
A	mm
B	you see you got valley gutter there and a valley gutter here and that's stuck there
C	yeah
A	mm that's how you do it
B	that's how you do it
A	but what you have to make sure
B	yeah that's right
A	otherwise what if you take them off between your toes make holes in the felt don't they?
B	that's right yeah yeah
A	so the on the rafter you're alright you can walk up and
B	you can walk up yeah
A	but you only have to sort of just dislodge every other you know
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	so that's what we're gonna do
A	well you could actually
B	probably
A	they're good tiles aren't they? cement tiles
B	yeah they're good tiles yeah yeah
A	you need one foot in the valley
B	that's right yeah
A	but you make sure you have good
B	put a pair of grippy boots on yeah
C	then probably not boots actually
A	no plimsolls
B	you want plimsolls yeah
C	yeah
B	she would wouldn't she?
A	like a cat er you'd be up there
C	yeah
B	yeah you'd be good at that
C	yeah
B	I'll stand down there and stop anything falling
A	do you like heights?
C	no I don't
A	no
C	but I I don't
C	yeah
A	all the time
C	mm
A	yeah
B	well I'll do it I mean I will do it when we get a nice day
A	mm
A	like today
B	er we've got other things to do
A	mm
B	gotta mend that chainsaw
C	yeah
A	jigsaw
B	chainsaw
A	yeah I know it's like a jigsaw
B	that is like a jigsaw
C	mm
A	yes
B	yeah well I suppose we'd better get on with that ain't we?
C	yeah okay
A	yeah
B	yep right oh
A	ah
