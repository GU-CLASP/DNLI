B	we could sing in parts
D	I'd rather you I'd rather you didn't
B	you and
D	try the no you can have the rice if you take all the chicken
A	there's a bit of meat there take

B	you're going to have so much fun with
A	it looks and smells gross
C	egg fried rice in the microwave
B	you're not you're not
D	you can buy bags of rice they're like a pound each though for like a
B	you're not sharing your cooking then?
A	we are cos we're going to make sure he eats right
C	why does he not eat properly?
B	so what happens on the day when he has to cook?
A	we teach him to cook
B	is he teachable?
A	that remains to be seen
B	mm
A	he's quite stubborn
D	you have to I think you have to enjoy food to to want to cook though
A	yeah I don't think he well he does enjoy food but
D	but like you have to be discerning otherwise you think oh you know why don't I eat stuff that comes out the oven every day
A	he has either ridiculously hot like high salt diet
C	does he?
A	so much salt
B	more than
A	yeah
D	I don't eat that much salt I just season my food
A	yeah you think
D	I don't I just season my food
B	focaccia has usually got sea salt on top of it doesn't it?
A	when he's in Subway he always asks for salt and pepper on the subs and stuff
B	it's usually quite salty
D	mm
B	erm
D	I don't salt my sandwiches
A	erm and he goes he goes to like Wetherspoons and he gets like a mixed grill and he's just pouring it on so it gets to the point when you don't think I don't reckon he's got the taste this pretty much any more
B	it's quite high gluten though isn't it? mm it's very stretchy like ciabatta
C	mm
A	I mean it doesn't taste better I think he just likes the taste of salt
B	but if you all cook with less salt he'll have to get used to it
A	exactly so we're going to do
B	and he'll stop the craze
A	we're going to see if we can do no
B	yeah if you buy proper salt like sea salt
D	you have to use less and it tastes better
B	yeah you use that
D	but you still get it's still the taste the
A	mm but I guess with salt if you add to much though you just taste the salt don't you?
B	some foods have salty
D	it depends on your palette I think I don't know you don't salt meat it can be very bland
A	yeah
B	you shouldn't salt beef
D	what do you mean you should salt beef
B	before you cook it because all the water all the juices leech out of it
A	you salt and pepper don't you? oh I
D	apparently yeah like joints of beef and stuff like that
B	any beef I've been told
D	yeah but you salt yeah but any dish you salt
A	like er shoulder shoulder if you like salt a shoulder before you put it in the oven
B	that's different but if you're say frying pieces of beef or or stir fried beef or something you shouldn't salt it
A	I wouldn't salt a steak before frying it cos it makes it dries it out doesn't it?
B	yeah because it draws out all the water
D	I don't salt my steaks no
A	yeah that's fine you pepper it don't you?
B	oh yeah
A	I do need to go
B	while
