B	or make a cardboard snowman
A	yeah
B	or make a snow
B	I'll build a bed
B	that'd be so sad
[ANNOTATION]	Person B seems that is sad	Entailment
B	and then you'd melt

B	er
A	the Snowman so it's not the little snowman the Snowman yeah
B	god I mean it's it's
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Person a want to go out and dance	Contradiction
B	I used to love that when I was younger but I used to get
A	I thought the snowman was a bit of a paedo
B	I never I
A	no
B	he was very like masculine though wasn't he? like with his
A	yeah he was
B	scarf and his
A	and I think a little bit of it was sexist if I remember rightly
[ANNOTATION]	Person A think that the snowman was a man with the shape of the man	Neutral
B	hat
A	I'm surely there was something
B	what? the female roles in it?
A	yeah
B	or the lack of female roles for one
B	and
A	I mean there was probably something in there cos there always is
B	and the
A	when was that made like?
[ANNOTATION]	Person A is curios about the time that the film was made	Entailment
B	probably yeah
A	mm
B	I mean
A	mm
B	implying that females are only paternal figures
A	yeah
B	maternal figures yeah
B	paternal yeah whatever
B	erm and then there's I think there's
[ANNOTATION]	Person B agree that in the past it was paternal figures in the films	Entailment
A	there's no women
B	I thought there was only like one
B	oh god yeah
A	mm
B	oh
B	yeah
B	still is
[ANNOTATION]	Person B believe that still it is like it	Entailment
A	he's still a paedo
B	still a paedo
A	oh yeah
B	the oh
B	like I used to literally just sit
B	erm
A	whoa
B	so
A	better than we ever get
A	oh I like it when it snows just when it
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A enjoys snow.	Entailment
B	it's more sometimes it's
A	mm
B	like it's more sleety
A	don't worry about disappointing me cos I get that too
B	okay
B	and hills and snow and stuff
A	could stay I dunno
[ANNOTATION]	It's 5C degrees outside.	Neutral
B	mm
A	when I should've done it in like
B	mm
A	erm
B	mm
A	and I suppose that's the case here isn't it? cos we've already paid
B	yeah
A	the next payment in January so
B	technically you could
A	and get my plane and what not
[ANNOTATION]	The payment has been completed.	Entailment
B	but then remember like you've only had one
A	two
B	what the
A	well there's the physics one
B	mm
A	the English one
B	yep
A	and the other English one that's this week
[ANNOTATION]	A mathematics one is left.	Contradiction
B	what's the other English one?
A	I'm not too sure I just know it's for
B	oh for fuck's sake
B	hack it?
A	I really don't
B	I mean yeah
A	but then at the same time like I do
B	would your mum be prepared to pick you up at Christmas or not?
B	no?
A	I mean well she would that's the thing like that's the horrible thing about it like she would pick me up
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker's A mother will be available at Christmas.	Entailment
B	mm
A	cos I don't have any money
B	don't don't don't think about that now don't think about don't regret
A	I know I wish I could
B	well
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A has not run out of money.	Contradiction
A	mm
B	yeah I know
A	what if I just sit here doing nothing for four weeks are they're gonna
B	I'd say if you
B	mm
A	expect me to
B	mm
A	like I just I can't make that kind of decision anyway I'm not
B	because yeah I mean you I think you've gotta like
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A thinks of doing nothing for 4 weeks in September.	Neutral
A	yeah I know I know what you mean
B	your that side of your brain just wants to quit everything because it's so scared of what's gonna happen
A	yeah
B	but it doesn't actually like consider what you're gonna do next almost like it's just like yeah
A	no
B	mm
A	you need to have something in the
B	mm
A	and I just wish I could like
B	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A wants to give up at a point.	Entailment
B	doing your work
A	I just don't see myself doing it
B	I mean at the end of the year
A	mm
B	you might not know what you want to change it to right now and that's okay
A	yeah then I'd have to do it for four years
B	but that's something you
A	then I'd have to do four years
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B understands how speaker A feels.	Entailment
B	no no you could
A	mm
B	so
A	mm
B	mm
A	at the moment
B	yeah you're not feeling it
A	cos it just makes absolutely no sense to me
B	mm
B	because we can
[ANNOTATION]	Something isn't reasonable for speaker A.	Entailment
A	it's not your responsibility to
A	no we haven't
B	yes we have
A	no we haven't
B	I said I I told you what I'd done today and I said
A	yeah but you said you were feeling shitty over the weekend and it's
B	and stuff
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A remember what speaker B said about the weekend.	Entailment
B	probably a little I don't know like I don't even know why though I've not even got a reason
A	in what way shitty?
B	just like
A	mm
B	but it just was like
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	The weekend was bad because speaker B had a lot of workload.	Neutral
B	and it was kind of a bit like that and it was really scary
A	yeah
B	actually it was a wave of lack of emotion actually it was more like everything was kind of sucked out of me and it
A	yeah
B	was horrible
A	what?
B	doctors and shit
A	what do you mean?
B	is anything going on with that or?
A	no
B	there's a lot of
A	this is what always happens with me like I start doing stuff and I start
B	stuff
A	you know making things
B	and then yeah
A	carelessness and then it just completely falls apart again and I'm back to square one like you
B	mm
A	and then I had that doctor's appointment and missed that and I've
B	I've
A	spoken to the doctor's or anyone?
B	not spoken to the doctor's
A	no?
B	but I've spoken to
A	yeah
B	erm
A	are you gonna keep going to that do you think
B	I think I will and I think
B	next time I might ask her to refer me to the mental health services
A	yeah
B	because
A	you should
B	yeah
A	tell her if she says no just be like well my friend said that you
A	referred so you can refer me
B	you can refer me bitch
A	you can refer me
B	yeah I mean I don't even really see how this is gonna help me to be honest but I might as well if it's the only thing I've got
A	yeah
B	then I think I might as well take advantage of it really
A	yeah definitely
A	it was on Friday
B	right okay
A	I just forgot I had it like honestly I wasn't trying to avoid it
B	no you just forgot
A	I just forgot yeah
A	so yeah
B	yeah
A	I don't know
B	mm
A	I really don't know
B	they should be supporting you more this like they've just sort of let you get away
B	not get away with but do you know what I mean? they've just left you to your own devices
A	well I dunno I think they have though I think like cos the doctor keeps ringing me up and I just don't get a signal here so I can't pick the phone up and then when they do
B	mm
B	mm
A	sometimes I just hate all the
B	all the communication yeah
A	just does not help
B	mm
A	in my head
B	mm
A	and I just feel really bad about it
B	don't feel bad about it because
A	mm
B	the problem is the reason that they're worried about you which is like obviously you're kind of declining with this like it's not
B	even though it wouldn't be the best thing it would be
A	it just it just really wouldn't
B	no
A	it wasn't last year
B	mm
A	and just tired and frustrated with
B	can't
A	like I went to a few interviews last year and just like fucking lost my shit
B	just doesn't understand
A	straight out of school and don't doesn't understand
B	it seems to be really
A	mm
B	paper rounds and
A	yeah
B	she worked as a shop assistant
A	yeah
B	now it's a lot more complicated
A	yeah
B	they seem to expect more and require more
A	definitely
B	mm
A	I just completely seized up and kind of like walked out of it
B	yeah
A	cos I was freaking out so much
B	and it's not it's not really great experience is it?
A	it was just horrible
B	no
A	you know we are a tourist town
B	mm
A	at all
B	mm
A	and
B	I mean I think personally like I don't know that much about your dad
A	mm
B	but what you said
A	mm
B	cos you don't anybody
A	no
B	where your dad is
A	I know it's like a horrible thing to say but me and my sister were saying that like
B	no no I get that
A	like the way we've been brought up with my mum and
B	mm
A	and he was like
B	mm
A	it it's just difficult to talk to him like a
B	mm
A	I know that's like such a stupid reason not to do it but it just
B	yeah yeah
B	he's not like a prominent figure in your life?
A	no
B	no?
A	and plus he's got the baby
B	pop in and yeah
A	yeah
B	mm
A	I just can't do this
B	I mean
A	mm
B	the way I see university or the way I've seen it before I came here and
A	mm
B	erm but
A	mm
B	which is a big difference from summer
A	you're an inspiration you know that?
A	yeah
A	mm
B	and it if it's that possible to get so low then it can change
A	do you know when I realised I was depressed?
B	when?
A	it was when I read
B	really
A	like honestly
B	really?
A	yeah
B	oh my god
A	cos of the Dementors
B	oh gosh wow okay
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	and I was like oh that's what they mean
B	mm
A	when I read it first I was like oh I don't understand
B	you didn't really understand what was behind them kinda thing you know?
A	no
B	it is quite a nice story
B	I think
A	no
B	it's just this big splodge of responsibility and effort and crap
A	mm
B	if I actually write down like
A	no
B	and if you
B	because
A	mm
B	it's not like oh it's shit like
B	it is
A	it does sound like a Lovato song
B	she should write a song like that if she hasn't already
A	those lyrics were probably used in like the The Climb my Miley Cyrus or something
B	okay
B	there's always gotta be another mountain
B	it's
A	oh
B	it's The Climb
A	fucking is a climb
B	it is a climb
A	it's Miley Cyrus
A	oh
B	er
A	kittens
B	oh you see this is what we need at university
A	pet therapy
B	how can I?
A	I don't know why like if
B	yes
B	like oh
A	that would just work so much better than therapy or pills like
A	oh
B	think more positively
A	what?
B	this is on Wikihow
A	what?
B	yeah
B	appreciate the little things
A	mm
B	try the little pastries you've gotta go to Greggs
B	try the pastry
A	you I realised there are two Greggs
B	that probably
A	yeah
B	commit to meditation and live in the moment
A	god
B	make time for reflection
A	this was literally written by some like
B	somebody who's not
A	not even depressed and is just kind of
B	er this is actually a good one stop comparing yourself to others
A	mm
B	erm feel more compassion why is there a doughnut?
B	your compassion
A	oh my god
B	oh my
B	fix your shit
A	mm
A	oh
B	though it is
A	I might go get some chocolate
B	yeah
A	and that's also walking
B	yes it is
A	oh that's easily done
[ANNOTATION]	Person A wants to go and get a chocolate	Entailment
B	mix up your routine
A	oh
A	it's just so patronising
B	this is how to be happy how can I make?
B	how can you make time for happiness?
A	I should do that one more often actually
A	mm
B	that's so such a gross way of saying it isn't it? that's like
A	yeah it really is
B	let go of control
B	no
A	this isn't a foreshadowing
A	I thought people wanted you to take more control of your life I thought that was the point
[ANNOTATION]	Person A is gonna have dinner	Contradiction
B	yeah I think
A	mm
B	seize control you are in control of your future your destiny
[ANNOTATION]	Person A think it is important to have your control	Entailment
A	mm
B	but
A	do nothing at all?
A	okay I'm following with that
B	oh no
B	no
A	that's just awful advice
B	that's the worst thing you can do when you're unhappy oh my god
A	oh wow
[ANNOTATION]	Person A is gonna go to club	Contradiction
B	okay cos science is obviously
B	you know?
A	mm
B	spend time with family
A	yeah
A	what?
B	no helping people
A	what?
[ANNOTATION]	Person A is gonna have a sandwich	Contradiction
B	they said you should help people a hundred hours a year
A	how does that work out daily?
B	I don't know
A	not very helpful
A	I don't help people enough what should I do?
B	help yourself
A	I'm too absorbed in myself to help you
B	help me help yourself
A	yeah how can I help you?
B	no yeah that's what I said
A	do you want me to like tidy your room or something?
B	no no I said help help yourself and you'll be helping me
A	why?
B	because I care about you and
A	mm
B	it does help me cos it'll make me happy it will please me
B	let's to go
B	it's not
A	no
B	somebody said
A	oh nice
B	yeah a sixteen year old boy
A	mm
B	you don't really sound like you care about that
A	well you know
B	no
B	move closer to work
A	mm good idea
B	let's go to
A	yeah
B	do you think
A	yes I think it would
A	we could chill together
B	chill in the lounge
A	everyone
B	getting older will actually make you happier
A	yeah I think it will I hope it will
B	yeah I think it will because
A	it's like that great Billy Joel song that I love
B	which
B	oh okay yeah yes
B	I mean you might hate being old and you might feel old well we're not actually old yet but you might dread being old but
A	mm
B	usually like they're very content
A	or dead
B	or dead
B	either way they're not experiencing
A	no
B	well some of them do experience pain because they've got arthritis and that but like
A	mm
B	to be honest I think I've considered old age more than anyone my age so
A	yeah
B	I do
B	I think so like I I think the more in
A	mm
B	woah
A	just imagine like
B	fuck
A	first wrinkle just how terrifying it could be
B	fuck
B	that's why I wanna get a
B	cos you do look younger with a fringe
A	I already get a wrinkly forehead so I'm fine
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	ten years ago they didn't have botox did they?
A	yeah but the point is everyone needs money if they want all the nice new things like that's
B	yeah
A	you need money
B	that's the thing like but
A	like in films
B	mm
A	like future films stuff seems to of filtered down so that everybody has equal kind of
B	mm
A	cos nobody'll
B	that's very true actually like no one can afford anything in this day and age
A	no
B	what the fuck? why aren't we using robots?
A	mm
B	but
A	like
B	it'd be kinda cool though for some
A	I mean we already use robots for like
B	like get me a drink
A	yeah
B	very useful
A	we're too poor to
B	I'd like a friend
A	yeah
B	a robot friend
A	I would
B	yeah you told me about your imaginary friend
A	did I?
B	yes you did
A	oh
B	like in the first week
A	oh
B	I'm so jealous you were in
A	be so much easier to
B	your past self
B	I can imagine
B	sigh
A	there were so many vintage shops you would've loved it
B	I probably would've done
A	like there was this called have you been to
B	erm
A	no well there's this there's this kind of like area called the
B	oh my god
A	just all the greatest clothes and things and it's just amazing
B	that's so cool
A	and they have a
B	oh
A	and I just like got lost in
B	that's so cool
A	I'm gonna like
A	I can just see this ending badly but
A	ah
B	no
A	it's it's all in case
B	oh
A	it's just cos this is a lost cause cos it's already got loads of scratches on it
B	you're just like yeah
A	and it's a bit thicker
B	I get so protective of all my stuff at first and then I'm just like na
A	yeah I dunno
B	I really hope like
A	mm
B	oh that's is very nice
A	shiny
B	I really hope
A	what I have children and
B	that's like
B	just been like I've been horrible to
A	that's basically what happens
B	oh no
A	cos people get so sick of their children when like when they get to like age six or seven cos they turn into little brats
B	what if the child annoyed you though? how bad would that be?
A	it would
B	but like what if you didn't like? like
A	yeah
A	well it's like love
B	I guess
B	like
A	well some people have trouble like bonding with their baby when it's born and stuff like they have like postnatal depression
B	yeah they do
A	but they eventually
B	they eventually kind of
A	yeah
B	what?
A	no no just like makes you connect with your child
B	oh I'm like no this is fun I'm having a ball
A	yeah
B	I I I'm not sure I like the idea of breast feeding to be honest
A	really?
B	like I
A	I think it's nice
B	I like it but not for me
A	no I mean
B	no I I don't have a problem with
A	no no it's cool
B	like if they do in public it's cool but it's like imagine myself do it
A	oh there's just such an issue with that like my sister worked at a restaurant
B	yeah
A	you know hide it or anything like it's just really upsetting like
B	they now have sleeves so women can do it under a thing
A	oh
B	like
A	it's just ridiculous that sometimes they get sent to like the loos and stuff to do it and it's like
B	it's like they shouldn't have to like
A	it's like a natural thing
B	mm
A	just don't look
B	I mean to me like I don't ever do like a double take if I see it cos I'm used to it
A	no
B	why are women's breasts even sexualized? I bet there's like some medieval reason
A	oh I know it's really annoying
B	like er the holy
A	it's just like porn isn't it?
B	you can't stop fidgeting
B	we are
A	I'm just like deflated like a balloon
A	I just felt myself get lighter
B	just like
A	I'm just so dumb
B	no you're not
A	but that just makes it worse when you say the age out loud
B	sorry you're only seven
A	thank you
B	because that was your favourite age
A	for god's sake why do I tell you everything?
B	oh my god?
A	what?
B	somebody in London I've just
B	it's been released yeah
A	oh my god
B	how horrible is that?
A	she probably had kids
B	yeah
B	she's escaped with minor injuries
A	oh my god
B	fucking
A	oh my god that's like
B	how does that even happen? I don't know
A	like as it was slowing down
B	yeah
A	I hope she gets a good case and
B	jesus christ
A	how old was she?
B	it doesn't say they've not really identified the woman yet
A	no
B	because
A	god how sick is that though? just
B	it's awful
A	and just like and you just look around at the world and you just wonder like what the fuck is the point like why would I even wanna just?
B	yeah
A	sort myself out because it's such a shit hole anyway like people are just fucking up left right and centre
B	you've said it
A	makes me really angry
B	what are they on?
A	it was just on Twitter like I didn't mean to see them like it was just loads of pictures of children
B	is this
A	yeah
B	oh my god
A	I mean no one noticed cos of the Paris attacks but there was stuff going on
B	it's just on kind of ongoing
A	yeah
B	strange cos we're kind of accustomed to it
A	yeah
B	how is that even?
A	I just really don't get humanity much any more
B	yeah
A	it really does
B	mm
A	and we've had these Paris attacks
B	mm
