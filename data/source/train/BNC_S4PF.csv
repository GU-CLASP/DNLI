B	well I don't think he really like approves of my ukulele
A	but I think ukulele is really cool
B	yeah but it clearly
A	cos it sounds really cool and to be able to say oh I play the ukulele and just bust it out like
B	little tiny I'm really
A	because it's small it's easier to carry around
B	yeah
A	and it sounds so much cooler
B	well it doesn't I really like the guitar
A	okay
B	but I don't think a guitar suits me too much though like
A	yeah well now that you've started playing the ukulele I can't imagine you with a full-sized
A	guitar and it's like me I can't imagine myself playing ukulele
A	it feels really
B	yeah
A	rest it on my knee but you can't do that with a ukulele
B	I really want
[ANNOTATION]	a ukelele is smaller than a guitar	Entailment
A	it's really weird
B	to save up and get a
A	I really want
B	I want
A	to save up and get a banjo
B	I want to get a guitar and I want to get a like a concert-sized ukulele
A	mm
B	because they're sort of
A	they're slightly
B	they're bigger
A	bigger yeah
B	cos my one is tiny I can hold it in the palm of my hand
B	but they're like mini guitars and I like them they're really cool and
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a would like to buy a banjo	Entailment
A	I want
B	for
A	I want an electro-acoustic guitar
B	I'd love to learn the guitar just to like an acoustic guitar but I don't feel like you know I don't know if I'll be very good at it I tried playing
A	yeah well
B	it was horrible
A	was terrible
B	it was
A	so don't like
B	like
A	just base it
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b already knows how to play the acoustic guitar	Contradiction
B	oh I forgot to give it back to her
B	I said I was gonna give it back to her on
A	well you were gonna bring it to school?
B	er well no I was gonna drop it off at her house
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b has a girlfriend	Neutral
A	oh yeah
B	so I'd go to her house
A	of course
B	but erm
A	give to her tomorrow when you go round to hers or does she come round yours?
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b wanted to leave something on someone else's house	Entailment
B	oh yeah I'm going round hers
A	well you can go round to hers and you can get Insurgent back from her
B	oh yeah
A	has she given it back to you?
B	no no
A	I can't believe
B	if she's cracked that spine
A	she's so
B	no she hasn't
A	I'm sure she hasn't
B	she was like I've nearly finished Insurgent I was like oh really?
A	really?
A	when you mean nearly do you mean you've read one page?
A	cos it took her how like
B	it I gave her
A	it took her years
B	Diversion
A	to read Diversion
B	in like November or something and she gave it back to me like last month
B	but she's trying because she thinks she's so good at English she's trying to be like a reader but I don't see any part of her that that's that interested in English she doesn't like reading she never reads books
A	she just wants to be a journalist
B	I know and
A	yeah
B	but then I guess that's what you do if you if you're good at something
B	because English is the only thing well I'm better at English than I am at
A	well I don't really wanna be a mathematician
A	like
B	yeah but I think you'd be a really good mathematician I feel like you'd be a really sassy
A	I don't I don't like
B	maths teacher
A	maybe actually I wouldn't mind
B	with a bob
A	being a maths teacher
B	with a bob and like smart glasses
A	because I do like quite I do quite like teaching even though I can't teach because I really don't know how to explain anything to anyone
A	but
B	I'd be a rubbish teacher I'd be awful
A	but I don't like mathematics like mathematicians always try and
B	yeah
A	and it's
B	you just like
A	like you just
B	solving the problems
B	but I'm I
A	or something like that
B	I'm not sure I'd want to be like an academic because
A	yeah
B	like like a total recluse just like
A	yeah that's
B	I I've got to pass my exam
A	mm
B	I've got pass my exam
B	but I you know teaching is cool but I don't think I'd be able to deal with children being sick
A	yeah
A	oh yeah
B	like well
A	well like just naughty
B	children yeah
A	I'll either be
B	yeah
A	or really bad
B	yeah like Mrs
A	yeah she's
B	she's
A	really bad
B	I know
A	I mean she sort of deals she kind of deals with them better than you think she does
B	yeah
A	but still
B	but she still like favouritises them
A	yeah I know
B	that's why they behave a little bit for her
A	how can you favouritise them? it's yeah
B	I don't understand why teachers give them so many second chances chances though like
A	yeah I'd just
B	cos it
A	like
B	be like get out of my classroom
A	yeah exactly or I think the tactic you have to do is like embarrass them or something
B	yeah
A	or maybe
B	like Mr
A	oh yeah
B	and he was like
A	it's giving the wrong impression
A	or something
B	but also all I'd want is
A	or like do you remember when Mr
B	yeah
A	and we had to work out if he was really bad
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	I know
A	at maths
B	why is
A	but somehow
B	yeah because he
A	there was
B	really liked
A	yeah he did
B	and I remember
A	yeah I know if that was
B	yeah
A	he'd be like oh sorry I didn't that one or like
A	or like not mention it
B	yeah
A	like he didn't mention
B	yeah
A	to get moved down
B	yeah
A	but still
B	I don't know why
A	but he won't
B	cos she's always going on about how maths is her strong point and stuff
A	yeah and she
B	and when she did well in that test like
A	I don't think she was actually that bad at maths
B	no
A	she's in like the bottom
B	yeah
A	half of the maths group
B	yeah
A	but she's still
B	I dunno I kind of I like maths when I can do it because it's sort of it's it's a nice feeling when you get a question right
B	but
A	yeah
B	and normally I just don't get it
A	yeah with English you can't do that
B	yeah
A	but with English there's no like I think that's why I don't like English really
B	yeah cos you're very
A	erm cos I like
B	all a very logical person aren't you?
A	having like an answer
B	yeah a right or wrong
A	knowing if it's right or wrong not
A	or something
B	but also er
A	and it's really hard to know like where you're going wrong like when we were writing our
B	mm
A	I didn't know
B	but the no the thing is the reason that I don't I'm not too sure about English is because I've never been like that particularly good at English in the past I've just been alright in the top set you know sort of bobbing along but then now
A	and now you're suddenly amazing
B	yeah so I'm just a bit worried that Miss
A	yeah every teacher is gonna mark you
B	yeah
A	differently
B	so if they like your writing style they give you a high mark and if they don't like it they give you a low mark so it's sort of like
A	yeah well before we had Miss
B	no she didn't like me at all
A	well actually she hated me
B	oh
A	and she like called me a pain or whatever
A	mm
B	but she really she really didn't like me at all she loved
A	oh
B	I sat next to
A	oh yeah
B	when she had
A	how did you get your hair
B	how did you do your hair? and
A	do it
B	it a bit
A	and it's like do you
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B believes that she didn't like him/her.	Entailment
B	yeah
A	or or whatever she said it was
B	well
A	yeah I know
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A is aware of what speaker  B is talking about	Entailment
A	so obviously I thought Mrs
B	yes so did I
A	so it's really hard to tell if she was like sarcastic or not
B	mm
A	she's really weird
B	well
A	sense of humour
B	yeah I remember and Mrs
A	oh yeah and she
B	and
A	Mrs
A	you were doing a
B	oh god
[ANNOTATION]	It was very obvious that she was sarcastic	Contradiction
A	A level
B	no
A	er GCSE in Japanese she was like
A	in a different language
B	obviously
A	so just think what she's going through
[ANNOTATION]	They are talking about a foreign language	Entailment
A	or whatever and
B	at one time well she didn't like me that much and she was really into
A	and she was like why don't you tell us about your GCSE
A	so
B	bit awkward I shouldn't have told her cos one time what was it? oh yeah we'd had an assessment
A	yeah cos you were like oh I I'm not here for the assessment and she was like oh why are not here? and it was like oh I'm doing a GCSE in Japanese and she was like
A	you're doing a GCSE in Japanese?
B	and then that was the day when we were planning the assessment she came over
[ANNOTATION]	She did a great job with the assessment	Neutral
A	mm
B	and talked to me for forty-five minutes
A	yeah and then she got grumpy at you at the end
B	she got angry at me cos I hadn't written anything
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	She was crying out of anger	Neutral
B	were you in my glass?
A	when she asked you about
B	when she made me
A	Japanese
B	oh
A	and you had to explain the
B	yeah
A	katakana
B	the
A	and and she didn't understand it and you were like well actually there's three alphabets
A	in Japanese
B	she was like three?
A	three?
A	how does that work? and you were like oh well there's one alphabet for English words
B	yeah
A	or not or European or whatever
B	one's normal out of one sort of English words and one that's got like thousands and she was like thousands? I was like oh
A	and then she was like think what
A	whenever she writes in Japanese
B	she was the only teacher that like properly liked me she absolutely loved me and then she left me
B	I remember oh I was actually I've let her down a bit because she told me I should definitely do a GCSE in geography I haven't taken geography
A	cos
B	I don't even know what she meant though because
A	yeah she was a bit weird
B	yeah
A	like in parents' evening once with my mum she was like if she if she puts her mind to it she could leave
A	and my mum was like what's she talking about?
A	erm
B	get good
A	yeah it's like
B	grades
A	I I'm just gonna sit there and not put my mind to it
A	and not put effort into my GCSEs
A	yeah of course
A	yeah
B	she really needs to start working for her GCSEs right now
A	yeah I didn't really
B	Miss
A	well actually
B	thing is I did
A	year seven
B	I did
A	mm no
B	I've
A	the beginning of year seven I did
B	yeah I worked so hard
A	but then I was like I'm in
B	I'm a rebel
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah I'm in
B	do you know
A	walk through the village in my
B	and
A	school uniform
B	form
A	because everyone will be younger than me
B	I remember walking home one time oh my god this is so embarrassing I had erm like a scone or something? and there was a lady behind me with like a
A	did she what you said that?
B	yeah I actually
A	to who?
B	to
A	oh
B	and I was like because like it's so cool like
B	and there was a child behind me who just wasn't bothered at all and I was trying to like show off like oh my god I just love doing cooking it's just so fun
B	I just thought I was so
A	what was that what year was that in?
B	yeah seven
A	in the cool school
B	in year eight in language futures
A	and year eight is the year when you think you're really cool
B	yeah
A	like especially the year eights now
B	you're not in year seven any more yeah oh
A	oh they're so annoying
B	I'm I'm but
A	they think they're so cool
B	they do
A	they're like the year
B	oh
A	they think they're rebels and whatever
B	they do
A	I think I did yeah
B	yeah because you were the only one that actually tried like I felt a
A	yeah and then
A	all I got was er everyone being grumpy at me that I'd got better than them
A	especially
A	er Spanish I really liked and I
B	yeah
A	had a feeling I might do it for GCSE so I was like I'd better revise for this
B	yeah
A	because I actually want to be good and then she's like you revised? I didn't and then after when she was like oh
B	she's so perfect
A	she didn't revise
B	yeah
A	if she revised she could have got the same as me
B	yeah
A	it's as simple as revision
B	yeah we were all like we thought we were so cool and didn't do any work and that's why it was so bad because especially I didn't even know why I did language futures because to do language futures you have to be really motivated
A	yeah
B	like a person that can study on their own and
A	I think it was good
B	I just can't
A	that I did language futures but
B	well you were
A	that was enough
B	you were sort of like
A	like had a good taste of it
B	well you were gonna do it this year weren't you? you were thinking about it
A	well I'd never don't think I was I really don't
B	because you were really good but like
A	I'm I'm so glad I didn't though because
B	yeah you and
B	oh
A	even though he's not in the top set he's was just like I'm gonna do language futures
B	I just like I hated it I couldn't do it especially as I already knew Miss
A	not as cheeky and loud as
B	no but I was really cheeky wasn't I? I was so loud
A	yeah you were
B	and so
A	not as much as they hated
B	yeah
A	yeah but
A	they never had any attention
B	I know
A	from her
B	they just had to do it themselves
A	yeah
B	oh but I just I couldn't deal with it like I don't
A	I don't wish I hadn't done it because I think
B	and that's cos you did really well
A	I think it was good that you did it
B	well yeah because it helped me know that I really wasn't very good at Spanish
A	I was so annoyed at
B	what was
A	cos she
A	and then she was like are you annoyed at us for dropping out of language futures? and I'm like well I'm not annoyed at those two
A	cos they told me
A	but you said you were gonna stay with me and she just ditched me
B	and then in the end I was like you know what? I can't be bothered I'm just gonna stay and then
A	and then you were the one that stayed
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	do you remember when me and
A	yeah
B	and me and
A	yeah so we sat next
B	and so we swapped
A	yeah
B	and you were waiting outside and I remember her going to you well you said that she went does she actually think I like her?
B	well because I was trying to like work as a team you can't just go no I don't wanna talk to you you're like
A	I know
B	like I never knew I was always a bit sort of
A	yeah she never like learnt any of her stuff
B	I know
A	and like for that presentation you know when you two did it on each other and
B	mm
A	I did mine on
B	and yours was really cool
B	and you did like all
A	yeah because I actually
B	proper special effects
A	yeah I I was actually quite proud of that Powerpoint especially when I like took that photo of her and cut out her eyes
B	yeah
A	and it was like she has brown eyes
A	brown hair
B	yeah
A	and braces
B	yeah that was quite
A	yeah but
B	but then she
A	mm
B	below you
B	chef is doing the paella
A	yeah and then
B	oh yeah
A	like the easiest thing ever she was like oh it's really hard they turned out amazingly and it was just all she did was roll out a bit of shop-bought puff pastry put some honey or whatever in it
A	and then roll it up and cut it into slices
A	and put it in the oven it's not really that hard
B	our omelette was a disaster it was
A	yeah she was like
B	she just mixed it around
A	oh my god
B	this is what you're meant to do with a proper omelette
A	yeah cos
B	and she was just
A	you're supposed to mix it a bit but as soon as you pour it into the oven
B	yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	so it's not
B	pan
A	cooked yet oh pan yeah so it's not cooked
B	yeah
A	yet so you can mix it round but but
B	but it was like cooked on the bottom and she just started scraping all these burnt bits
A	yeah and scratch off the pan
B	yeah
A	oh
B	and yeah we went home like a
B	gloopy
A	raw egg
B	egg
A	with like
A	black
A	yeah she was like shaking it and it came out
A	oh
B	I sent a picture to
B	it literally just looked like sick in a tub
A	oh
B	I didn't actually eat any of that I just threw it in the that wasted a whole six eggs I went out and bought six
A	yeah you had six
B	eggs
A	eggs or something yeah
B	each six eggs each
B	and then
A	you should have halved it by three
B	well we thought it was gonna go really well
A	yeah yeah
A	mm
B	but then you made your really cool paella you were like going oh
B	I don't know why you didn't take food tech actually cos you were
A	mm
B	really good at food tech
A	yeah because I like cooking
B	just not at school
A	I don't like food tech
B	the
A	I mean
B	I can't deal with the sinks
A	I kind I like cooking at school because I think it gives you an opportunity to actually cook and try
B	to show off all your skills
A	new recipes and stuff like cos otherwise I don't I don't cook that much
B	no cos I I mean I have to like arrange it and then write down
A	yeah
B	the ingredients on a shopping list
A	yeah exactly and decide
B	it's a bit er
A	what to cook
B	yeah so much effort
A	and then it has to be like particular to like a dinner or
B	yeah yeah
A	a pudding or something it can't just be like
B	yeah
A	on a week that we're not gonna eat it or whatever erm
B	mm
A	because I would never like experiment with fancy caramel
B	yeah
A	cupcakes or whatever
B	yeah
A	because you can never really do anything in an
B	mm
A	hour
B	yeah god
A	safety information when you're cooking a cupcake like don't put your hand in the oven
A	because it will burn
B	I always remember
A	things like like that just gonna get a sponge
B	it was so bad
A	just get a sponge
B	because I always left everything to the last minute the night before I was cooking something I'd be like oh wait
A	oh yeah same yeah
B	I'm cooking erm I'm cooking something tomorrow
A	but it's it's really hard to
B	to remember
A	remember I know and then oh the worst time definitely was when we were making stuffed peppers? and I literally turned up to school
B	I made stuffed potatoes
B	I
A	I got chef of the lesson
B	did you?
A	for the stuffed potatoes
B	I never got chef of the lesson that's why I didn't take food tech she hated me well it's not cos I just hated food tech but I like I literally turned up for school with two peppers and a can of tuna
B	it was literally it
A	I
B	and so I opened
A	well I did like
B	the can of tuna
A	roasted potatoes and then I sneaked it out
B	no I didn't even
A	and put bacon and stuff in
B	spooned in the tuna put on the lids I'm done
B	and so it just it literally took me
A	yeah but
B	two minutes and so I just had to stand around and help
B	oh I just I couldn't do it and
A	oh
B	the diet cream cheese it will not work
A	yeah cos
B	you can't do it
A	there's not enough fat
B	at all and
A	do you want some more juice?
B	yes please just a tiny bit and then I was like erm
A	tell me when
B	that's fine erm
A	I'm not sure if I can use this straw any more
A	and you were like I told you so
B	I remember my cookies were disgusting I definitely like someone didn't clean the bowl properly because it tasted like
A	oh
B	vegetable stock
A	I hate that that's another thing I hate about the food tech
B	mm cos like
A	cos before you you get a class that doesn't care about washing up
B	mm
A	so they just like leave
B	yeah
A	in or whatever
B	and Miss
B	yeah and not
A	when I know everything's clean
B	and when you have to use a sieve
A	and I have enough time oh yeah
B	and you can see the clumps
A	like bits of
A	stuff and
A	yeah cos no one washes sieves properly
B	you just rinse it out don't you?
A	yeah and then
B	and then obviously the flour is like clumps
A	that's worse cos it's like flour clumpy
B	mm oh
A	oh yeah
B	and
A	I always had to do that cos er
B	erm
B	wiped my hand on it
A	oh the
B	erm
A	yeah
A	she was so annoying
A	I hated her
A	she came up and she was like you're not supposed to stir the soup all the time and I was like oh I was just giving it a
A	stir to get it off the bottom I
A	the whole time she was like yeah but I saw you stir it five minutes ago
A	I was like oh sorry
A	she was like yeah you should read the instructions you're not supposed to stir the soup and I was like what the
B	I remember do you remember the time when
A	she was so
B	anyway I
A	oh yeah
B	I was standing by the washing machine and she went to Miss
B	and as I turned around and she looked at me
A	oh you naughty girl
B	she was like cos someone's wiped their hands on these towels I was like oh
A	so naughty
A	oh
B	oh
A	er no we still have
B	okay
B	call it a day
B	toodle-pip
B	I I wish erm
A	yeah
B	she didn't do her ICT homework she didn't do pretty sure she hadn't done any of her geography
A	like with homework unless it's like a subject like RE
B	yeah
A	er you
B	yeah I
A	especially if it's like a subject you're gonna take at GCSE
B	like maths or English or something
A	yeah cos
B	I
B	it's like great I can make a poster
A	yeah then I don't like it
B	yeah
A	if it's like an easy one
B	mm
A	or well like maths
B	yeah
A	and that's all you have to do
B	and that's questions that I can never do
A	that's
B	mm
A	cos then you still learn it but you don't have to
B	yeah it's like
A	like tech homework like
B	oh yeah
A	DT er don't have DT any more product design
B	product design
A	erm I don't like their homeworks I never like
B	mm
A	DT
B	I
A	product design
B	I
A	tech homework
B	I didn't
A	they're always like research metals and then you have to write a whole page about different types of metals
B	yeah
A	or whatever
B	well Mr
A	uhu
B	and nobody else tries and I'm just always there like getting mine done really quickly
A	and it's just everyone else is really
B	yeah when we had to
A	well actually you are good at product design
B	no like when we went to the
A	you got chosen for that competition
B	yeah I know exactly when we went there
B	I was decorating it I was colouring
A	well there you go you need someone for the portfolio to
B	yeah I should become like a design worker
B	but not but not actually designing an actual product
A	a decorator
B	just decorating
A	like you can be the erm what's it called? it's like well I'm not sure if it is an actual thing but like the the
B	the aesthetically pleasing
A	yeah but erm
B	yeah
A	look nicer
A	and they can come to you like I have this great machine but it looks ugly on the outside
A	you'd be like right what you need
B	right stripes on this side
B	spots here
B	like I and then but we did win the portfolio award
B	and then
B	did the whole portfolio but the machine that we did didn't even work that well to be honest it was because we were playing with it loads like turning the battery on and off so it was spinning round so one of the things came loose so when we put it on the string it just kept falling off
B	but luckily we realised on the fourth attempt we were meant to have three attempts but they pretended they didn't notice the first one
A	well done
B	the teachers were so cool it went forwards and backwards because they like rewired the motor
A	that is
B	and it had two people on it and it was it was so cool
A	did they
B	after and I got to work it because I was standing at the front and they were like do you wanna do it? I was like oh okay er
A	oh
B	it was so cool
A	cool
