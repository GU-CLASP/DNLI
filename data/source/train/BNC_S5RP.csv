B	yeah so erm
A	fascists
B	you know
B	I know I went for an interview at erm near Waterloo and they were
A	right yeah
B	er no well I mean I thought I would enjoy that erm
A	ah
B	but it wasn't er you know it just fell apart didn't it?
A	it just fell apart
B	I mean the the facilities were there
A	mm
B	never taught in like a place like that
A	sometimes there were students
B	yeah sometimes with the students
A	no
B	think he lost interest cos it was depressing for him
A	well yeah yeah and it's weird isn't it?
A	for
B	he didn't mind one-to-one but I mean erm
A	it's a different lesson it's a
B	yeah
A	you can prepare a one-to-one lesson that's fine but you don't know if it's gonna be a one-to-one lesson or a group of ten
B	it's different
B	it's just a shame but erm
A	it is a shame but then
B	no hopeless
A	a meddler
B	not interested
A	not interested and and at the same time a meddler
B	yeah
A	pain in the arse but they've done something with the paths round here haven't they?
B	it looks yeah they've cordoned it cordoned it off with rope
A	yeah
B	it looks it looks a bit more
A	and these must be new over there
B	maybe they're trying to protect the grass more
A	yeah maybe
B	using
A	yeah
B	unofficial
A	maybe some
B	but there's a lot more growth I mean all that all that all those leaves you could see the wall before
A	oh yeah
B	you can't see the wall cos it that's that's summer growth
A	is that a lime tree is that?
B	is it a lime tree?
A	I dunno
A	no no
B	so what what do they call a lime tree then?
A	I dunno
B	lime tree go on
A	must be like an cos they're native trees so it must be an olde olde olde
B	right yeah probably
A	don't know and we can look that up later
B	fascinated by squirrels
A	yeah
B	through
A	oh okay
B	they weren't interested in the view could see Big Ben London Eye you know the things you'd think
A	weren't they?
B	visitors
A	alright
B	to London would be interested in
B	they were just fascinated by these little squirrels
A	yeah
B	and they were taking pictures of them videos of them and and the
A	yeah
A	I mean they
B	they'd be in someone's pot
B	oh yeah
A	and erm
B	well no
A	right
B	bamboo forests but they don't mate very well in the wild so so
A	even
B	so that's why and they use them for
A	so even if
B	no
A	oh
B	I mean Chris Packham you know that funny er naturalist
B	a naturalist he's a conservationist
A	a
B	he said he said yeah you should let let let it have a natural death sort of thing
A	oh okay
B	but I mean erm
A	but
B	some ways like if they're really mating
A	if they can't be bothered
B	the students can't be bothered what are you doing?
B	jumping up and down like a maniac but
B	the pandas can't be bothered
B	it's they're bizarre animals though they really are
A	mm mm what are they? are they? they're just pandas they're not bears are they
B	bear they're a type of bear
A	are they? oh
B	yeah
A	uhu
A	okay
B	cat bear so I dunno what
B	I don't know why they call them cat bears
A	they sleep a lot
B	yeah
A	mm have they got other bears there?
B	I think they do
A	Wild China I've seen
B	there are
A	a few of them
B	very nice areas where there is still wildlife you know where they
A	mm mm
B	tend to be remote and things
A	oh
B	I remember going outside the town I was teaching in in the countryside looking for wildlife
A	right
B	I was
A	and
B	over-farming
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	lunchtime jog
A	oh yeah because I remember watching
B	really?
A	and there was yeah there was a Chinese there was a guy in the east of
B	oh no
A	mm got ambushed or something
B	wow yeah they do exist in the
A	yeah yeah
B	deep forest I suppose yeah
A	mm
B	and most of China is like
A	mm
B	most of the population is sort of squashed into
B	one third of the country the other two thirds
A	right
B	are very sparsely populated
A	uhu
B	so
A	I bet
B	one billion people but not
A	mm
B	you know
A	yeah
A	oh really?
B	boy's caught a pigeon what is he doing? bit of animal cruelty isn't it? I was hoping he'd trip up on the rope
A	it's a bit
B	things students do eh?
A	oh it's so funny
B	looks like the class clown doesn't he?
B	it's like his head's been wedged down a loo and flushed
A	is he the one that had the pigeon?
B	yeah
A	something like that
B	oh dear
A	Tibet yeah the the the the the girl I asked
B	and
A	mm
B	yeah
A	and then I said
A	that
B	that's the that's just one of the standard phrases that gets
A	and then I
B	yeah
A	let's not discuss politics
A	mm
B	and they've been under house arrest for years now
A	okay
B	yeah I mean there are lots of people in China who would
A	mm hm
B	they did invade and take it over
A	uhu
B	but they were their own country you know
A	mm
B	but the People's Republic incorporated it
A	this
B	as as Xinjiang as well where
A	kicking yeah
B	kicking off
A	yeah
B	because they
A	I and and and that yeah that that could be a bit of a
B	well
A	I suppose not
B	are they with a full beard and they're not gonna look like a you know?
A	like that yeah
B	what most people think like do you know what I mean
A	yeah
B	it's like it's a very na√Øve approach to take to
A	right
B	anti-terrorism
B	who that's just their culture
A	mm
B	and they're not terrorists
B	that's just the this is the this is the thing
B	so that's the so it's like a sledge
A	right
B	and that's what rubs them the wrong way with the local people
B	and they
B	is lacking in the
A	mm
B	I dunno
A	well that's what I mean that girl surprised me because I thought she would be
A	she's a bit more kind of
A	liberal
B	no I mean
A	it's the
B	the younger generation
A	mm yeah
B	cos that that gets drummed
A	bedtime reading
B	that gets drummed
B	you know
A	she's gonna sort of be reading some nice you know child story or Chang'e
B	I I well the
A	mm mm
B	what they mean is continuous history and and or political
A	oh I know
B	it's always contentious you know?
B	I mean people will
A	mm
B	people nor nations
A	no no it's crazy isn't it?
B	even South Korea's
A	yeah
B	the government doesn't want competition I said no
A	no
B	it's a political thing they don't want people to they don't they want control of how people communicate
A	yeah
B	and that's what it's about in these days no matter how much they dress it up
A	mm
B	and they can well
A	so is that what they say they don't want the competition?
B	the Party are very clever they'll always dress it up in nationalist terms
A	oh yeah
B	and then
A	mm mm
B	Baidu and all those places so
A	okay
B	is still there so that
B	and they get support from
A	was he?
B	and er yeah and the government in China's been targeting foreign companies to make examples of them
A	er
B	spying and espionage and
A	er
B	there's a lot of Cold War stuff goes on still
A	ah
B	so
A	well it sounds yeah yeah
A	and the this kid there's one student lad I
B	really yeah yeah
A	oh
A	mm
B	political books he's going to take back and read so
A	free
A	so where are they now? still in Paris?
B	in Paris
A	no it's crazy
B	they went to Montmartre which is a a very historical area
A	yeah
B	but because of their their
A	and they're still there
A	where in Germany are they going?
B	Frankfurt and Berlin
A	why Frankfurt?
B	I dunno
A	no that's what I thought
B	I'd rather go to Munich
A	yeah yeah yeah Munich's a nice little place little place did I say little place? it is a little place
B	I mean I don't know why they're going there but then they're very brave they they they haven't booked in advance they're just going on trains and youth hostelling and
A	oh okay
B	you know very independent but erm
A	oh
B	they have
A	mm
B	Paris syndrome where they arrive and because it's not like how they see it in the movies or TV in Japan they they get a shock
B	and some of them had to go back on the plane and I
A	well
B	it's funny isn't it cos travel is all about expectation
A	mm hm
B	but if you have no expectations
A	yeah
B	if you have such weird high expectations of a place
A	but then again Paris probably
B	you know
A	yeah I was talking about it to
B	yeah
A	everyone comes to see it bollocks if it's not there
B	but
A	mm
A	yeah
B	Lisbon or wherever
A	mm mm
B	so people might say well if you have time oh don't bother going to Paris
A	don't bother going to Paris
B	think there's that danger now because erm
A	yeah that's what people say
B	the Paris
A	but I've always found them to be and there's a new sort of younger generation of people there who are kind of
A	probably
B	they don't care about that no no you're right you're right
A	no no no
B	and there's so many French people in London
A	yeah exactly and and London and that connection between London and Paris is seen as a
B	yeah yeah yeah yeah it's
A	opportunity so why would you sort of be an arrogant fool and pretend you can't speak English just so that
B	oh no
A	you for pride or whatever I dunno
B	cos the other side of the coin is we used to go there speak French and they
A	no
B	I think might be changing
A	erm you know
B	I haven't been there for years
A	yeah quite like Paris
B	I'd like to go to France again soon cos it will practise French you know? I haven't practised it in years
A	yeah
B	oh right yeah no that would be nice
B	I know World War One
A	or as it's that
B	yeah I know definitely
B	might be might be
A	it will be interesting though
B	definitely in the future no yeah definitely
A	cos
B	no
B	that's the thing you have different interests don't you as a couple?
A	yeah no and I'm glad about that you know?
B	you don't have to
B	yeah
A	her friends and does her things and I go out and do my things
B	exactly
A	yeah
B	yeah
B	that's the way it should be
A	yeah
A	yeah everything together yeah
B	yeah
B	my wife's friends
A	you gotta sit there and er er
B	couple of them are very nice but the things they talk about I'm not
A	yeah you're not interested are you?
B	really into
A	yeah
B	but not to go out specifically to meet them
A	don't go out
B	it's cos that's when problems occur when you're forced to do everything together
A	yeah
B	I don't think you should be
A	and I think that you should
B	you need your space
A	yeah yeah and allow them to talk the way they talk and to be the way they are do what they wanna do
B	exactly
B	cos
B	you know if we sort of met
A	yeah
B	TEFL and stuff
A	yeah yeah
B	no it's well I've always found that funny as well
A	it's that bloke again
B	oh yeah
A	where did he go? I dunno
B	maybe he's doing er Tavistock as well
A	maybe
B	those shirts are very hot actually aren't they?
A	I've never erm
B	I don't find them very cool to wear
A	I've never erm
B	football yeah erm
A	yeah
B	what you wanna wear is sort of like a loose cotton thing
A	those you sweat like a
B	yeah
A	sweaty thing
B	I dunno why I mind you I don't know maybe the technology's moved on the
A	cool as in temperature
B	yeah
B	even if
A	season after next
B	after so not even next season
A	not even next so the the scam going at the moment is
B	that's a long way
A	if you buy a season ticket this year you'll have priority on the last on the final season at Boleyn at you know the Boleyn ground
B	you don't need priority there'll be hundreds of seats empty it's a massive stadium
A	well you see what they reckon they're gonna do is every match is gonna have a theme to it so next season is gonna be a
B	what dress up as crocodiles? or
A	well I dunno er yeah what kind of theme
B	they're trying to
A	I think that's what it's all about
B	what do they mean theme?
A	I dunno
B	like what? bring bring your own wine or something
A	I dunno bring your own tomatoes to throw
A	and then and then and then if you have a ticket for that that season you'll be on a priority list for the season after in the new stadium which is what eighty thousand seater they're not gonna sell that out in a hurry are they? if they have a diabolical couple of seasons which is highly likely
A	mm
A	but apparently they're gonna be themed
B	how strange
A	no I couldn't afford it
B	it's expensive isn't it?
A	it's expensive to watch a pile of muppets running
B	yeah
A	you know and it
B	so they're not famed for like Luton
A	they they
A	West he's Sam is Big Sam's famous for his long ball game isn't he?
B	oh I see okay
A	so you know the fans react to that say we we're West Ham we run with the ball
B	oh yeah
A	just in front of their own goal and I said to the guy next to me
B	just for the sake of it
A	it'd be nice if they yeah exactly you know oh look oh look we can pass but
B	the ball doesn't really move up the pitch
A	no no
B	so is Upton park or whatever it's called
A	Boleyn ground
B	Boleyn ground
A	Upton park
B	is it is it nice a nice stadium or?
A	it's a nice sort of you know one of those stadiums where you're here and there's the pitch
B	right
A	you know and you get a smack in the face with the ball and that sort of thing
B	are the stands comfortable?
A	and
B	is it nice?
A	I went to one
B	historical?
A	yeah yeah it's a nice little ground
B	is the ground Victorian or is er art deco or is it like Arsenal's? Highbury used to be or? what sort of period
A	not as grand as Highbury
B	no
A	it's no I don't think it's as it's no it's as
B	any any architecture?
A	no it's a bit
B	so they might knock the whole thing down and
A	I would imagine they would
B	build something there
A	yeah there's no nice facades that they would keep
B	cos Highbury they kept the
A	yeah
B	main stand that was beautiful
A	yeah
B	and then the middle is
A	mm mm mm
B	that's a long so they won't that's a bit strange the stadium won't be ready until season after next
A	I don't know no isn't didn't you say there's some athletics going on there or something?
B	oh yeah the World Championships
A	so perhaps they're waiting till after that
B	ah
A	oh is it? oh
B	or they'll make it so that the
A	it's retractable isn't it?
B	stands already isn't it?
A	mm
B	I think or maybe not maybe that's what they have to work on
A	maybe that's what they're doing
B	god it's very hot isn't it?
A	it is in the sun
B	it's intense
A	oh yeah
B	oh yeah so erm
A	yeah yeah
B	wouldn't be university students here unless they've come from pre-sessional that's the other thing I need to almost go round with flyers and grab students to like for my studies it's terrible
A	oh
B	even the pilot but this is the problem nowadays even my pilot study
A	uhu
B	only one person replied
A	really?
B	so this is people who know me or a
A	yeah
B	and they're not even bothering to reply and the
B	to take part in your main study can you imagine?
A	never gonna happen
B	I think research is all
A	okay
B	to have any value
A	yes yes yes yeah yeah
B	I think that's t'ai chi I think
A	I well I was wondering if it is t'ai chi it looks more like something she's made up
A	seen a bit of t'ai chi
B	it's not bad though I suppose
A	although I've got an interesting corpora at the moment
B	have you?
A	well that's part of my argument for erm course book design really
B	oh is it part of your study?
A	well not this but yeah
B	ah
A	in general corpora and is
B	and how is your writing going?
A	well it was alright it was bit it was a bit slow last week last last week or the week before? but that was I think going away and then coming back and being a bit disruptive
B	oh yeah how was Devon?
A	lovely
B	like my dad's still down there in
A	still?
B	yeah they had to
A	this is not where you lived while you were there? no you lived next
B	no my dad my parents bought a
A	okay
B	it was like a little holiday home they're one of the Londoners who out-price locals and
A	bloody hell
B	yeah sorry
A	mind you
B	well everyone who lives there lives from
A	right yeah yeah
B	well
A	so you're doing them a favour by buying stuff
B	cos the
A	no no not at all
B	I was thinking that when I was down there last time they people are
A	not at all
B	if you don't have a car you're screwed
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	to get up there from
B	by bus
A	take a bus?
B	and the bus drivers are nutters down there we took the coastal bus
A	I know this road like the back of my hand
B	I know that's what it's like isn't it? you little country
B	bus
A	yeah yeah
B	it was like
A	well I I noticed that
B	I mean
A	yeah there's a lot of boy racers down that part
B	but you don't know there's a car coming
A	no
B	round the corner
A	sixty mile an hour yeah
B	who's just veered to the right and
A	yeah
B	is gonna have a head-on collision
A	yeah I know it's very true
B	yeah my friend was a bit like that on the Isle of Wight he drove a bit manically round the lanes it's like
A	your brother did that?
B	no a friend I have who moved
A	your brother was
B	yeah my brother's also
A	I've never been to the Isle of Wight
B	two
A	no
B	it's nice you can get the ferry from Victoria or Waterloo you go straight to Portsmouth the ticket includes the ferry
A	hovercraft?
B	to no erm
B	fast of sort of speed
A	oh
A	oh yeah
B	you can get a hovercraft but they're not that frequent
A	and how much is that?
B	oh
A	but then what do you do are you stranded when you get to the other end?
B	er well no you can you can walk
A	and that must be a nicer place than Portsmouth
B	yeah it is yeah I mean Isle of Wight's got all that interesting stuff you can see you know like sort of
A	mm
B	old Roman ruins sort of the nice countryside country walks
A	mm
B	garlic farm
A	and you were there recently weren't you?
B	about three months ago yeah
A	oh yeah that's right yeah yeah
B	with
A	oh that's
B	have to go some time
A	like to go everywhere
B	that's the problem isn't it? I was just sitting in there I mean two hours in the morning was enough for me sitting down
A	yeah
B	it's
A	yeah
B	typing away
A	each day
B	I mean
A	mm hm
B	I try and do that a lot and then I do notes on the laptop I read PDFs and I do some research online I try and mix it up a lot but if I sat and wrote I could do that but for like hour and a half two hours stop
A	oh I can't
B	yeah I know don't blame you
A	it's nice and warm I might take my trousers off
B	end of conversation
A	yeah is that that?
B	yeah er yeah no it's erm
A	is that them girls that were doing the dance a minute ago?
B	no
A	where were they from then?
B	don't know
A	let's listen
B	I think that'll be Taiwan or China
A	I'm
A	are there big
B	well?
A	they're Chinese speaking aren't they?
B	well if they are then they could be Taiwanese
A	okay
B	cos that's more the American diet
A	aha
B	fast food stuff and
A	right
B	there was this wonderful stand-up comedian from China she was making a joke about people from Shandong province
A	uhu?
B	and she said
B	and she said when you see people you see people doing drugs in Shandong like a line of coke they're not doing drugs she they
B	they're doing salt
A	salt
B	it's
B	but it's true I had a student from Shandong
A	uhu
B	and he put
A	where's
B	the
A	yeah
B	but they
A	maybe that's where that girl's from
A	okay
B	erm
A	right
B	and that's what makes it tasty at the end of the day you know?
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	it's not
A	yeah
B	but it's it's the salt
[ANNOTATION]	They think the salt makes it taste good.	Entailment
