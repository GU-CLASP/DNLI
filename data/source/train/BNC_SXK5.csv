A	it's er it's just so much more science like like I like the science element of it but as long as the thing that attracted me to human sciences is like it's so interdisciplinary and the the things that have attracted me this year about my course have been
B	RS?
A	RS you know how we can apply it to people or situations and looking at culture identity all that kind of thing whereas UCL
B	so human sciences at
A	yeah basically
A	it's like it's like yeah it's er
B	so what's like
B	right
A	kind of human geography elements of
B	yeah
A	which er demography
B	okay
B	so more humanities?
A	basically yeah yeah it's more humanities based there than science based at er
B	what was it like at
A	I really enjoyed it oh
B	but that's that's your thing isn't it?
A	er
B	I mean you do
A	I prefer essays to
B	history and
A	er RS yeah
B	RS
A	I
B	statistics is big

B	you want to drink the foam?
A	yeah I

B	I'm really excited to do maths at uni
A	yeah? if it's great
B	I really wanna get into uni to do maths but a lot of maths grades are quite high
A	right
B	that's why I'm thinking of a foundation year at

B	so that's why I can change it
A	oh I see right
A	yeah
B	erm

A	well
B	still in
A	what's the time now?
B	six ten
A	probably eight nine I'll be fine don't worry yeah yeah I'll be fine

B	I think my sister told my mum
A	what about the drinks?
A	what the fuck?
A	she said it to your sister
B	no it's fine my mum my mum doesn't care
A	does she not?
B	when when she er heard about the your party she was like started talking to me about stories about how my
A	really?
B	my mum's
A	yeah
B	so my mum's brothers
A	yeah
B	used to drink so much and get headaches and they
A	you're kidding me?
B	the argument for me not drinking too much is you'll get a headache in the morning
A	wow
B	hangover
A	sick
B	I was like
A	sick
B	yeah but
A	that's good man
B	she doesn't mind too much as long as
A	you're safe I guess?
B	yeah yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah yeah
A	I mean we're not planning to get completely pissed but
B	like when I went out with my friends on the
A	yeah
B	like most of them couldn't remember what was happening like
A	when was this?
B	mm?
A	when was this at the?
B	Christmas part
A	oh cool what
B	I'd like to say last Saturday
A	oh okay
B	last Saturday
B	yeah it was last Saturday
A	right right
B	we went to er
A	yeah
B	everyone got completely smashed there
A	free alcohol?
B	yeah my two of my mates were so smashed they had to go home because they couldn't walk or talk or anything
A	shit
B	they were so badly done the rest of us were fine we went to club after
A	yeah
B	on like like four other mates
A	yeah
B	er and erm then then four got smashed I was like okay I'm gonna cut this is too much for me
A	too much
B	this I was just too
A	too much for
B	just leave before my mum gets too concerned or I like get too drunk and can't remember what's happening
A	yeah
B	cos the problem is if I do get too drunk and then I go home my mum will be like no never again
A	really?
B	so I
A	okay
B	an element of controlling myself
A	okay when was the first time you drunk?
B	oh ages ago
A	when did you start? fifteen sixteen?
B	last year seventeen
A	okay but
B	yeah
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	end of sixteen start of seventeen
A	okay so year twelve it year
B	yeah year
A	oh
B	summer year eleven?
A	oh that
B	that was the first party
B	even then I didn't get too smashed
A	that's good that's good that's good
B	I mean I've drank with my parents long before that
A	oh yeah yeah
B	like around fifteen and sixteen
A	okay
B	but but that was just beer and cider
A	what kind of yeah what kind of atmosphere was that? were they just like oh have a pint or something or did you ask for it? or
B	yeah yeah it's just do you want a pint? it's like yeah okay
A	so
B	I mean I had a beard so it was pretty easy to get it
A	yeah yeah yeah definitely
B	but er
A	oh nice
B	it's like just er rum and stuff
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	vodka
A	yeah getting really into rum I'm liking it rather a lot more
B	rum's really yeah
A	just feeling the flavour of it you know?
B	Captain Morgan
A	oh
B	yeah
A	that gingerbread thing was sick like
B	it was so nice
A	I mean I dig it I dig it
B	vodka
A	yeah
B	people don't like it I understand why they don't like it
A	yeah
B	yet people still drink it Captain Morgan
A	actually a flavour
B	I would I would probably just
A	right
B	really flavoured it mixes really well
A	exactly yeah
B	vodka doesn't mix as well as rum
A	yeah it's just kind of like bulking things up with alcohol with
B	gin
A	a slight taste
B	gin as well gin's really good with mixing
A	yeah yeah yeah erm talking to
B	yeah
A	he was like he didn't get into whisky until he
B	yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	er he was saying like two things you can do you either just mix it with ginger and she was suggesting
B	I prefer whisky over vodka like vodka's just no flavour at all it's just there is no flavour
A	how about the
B	no no no
A	really?
B	there's still no flavour
A	I kind of taste it
B	like
A	right
B	it tastes of too much of nothing
A	okay yeah yeah
B	unless you mix it and that's why people
A	that's why you take shots of it
B	so like when you take shots you're just like oh this is fine it doesn't taste of anything
A	right
B	it's not that pleasurable it just gets you drunk rum and whisky
A	yeah
B	eventually it'll start to taste nice
A	yeah
B	so that's why people will drink it gin
A	yeah
B	gin gin and tonic
A	gin gin
B	is so
A	yeah you know we should try the try the red berry er we bought red berry Ciroc and I I genuinely think that tastes better like even
B	er I
A	but
B	er I don't know
A	yeah
B	er
A	or we'll try the marshmallow shit
A	and that's only twenty percent that's only twenty percent
B	do you have marshmallow?
A	yeah yeah yeah it's er what a marshmallow
B	well Ciroc
A	er vodka oh no no it's not a Ciroc it's er just some brand or something
B	well with Ciroc marshmallow Ciroc?
A	no the er
B	does
A	the marshmallow vodka he he I I
B	but who has the marshmallow Ciroc?
A	I
B	oh it was just marshmallow flavoured vodka?
A	yeah
B	okay who has that? you?
A	me yeah I have that I have er Jack Daniels Fire unopened I have half a bottle of Captain Morgan I have half a bottle of Bacardi they last for like months so er
B	what's Bacardi?
A	erm rum
B	what what
A	but it's like it's like white rum so er
B	when I went to the
A	yeah
B	rum and then Jagermeister
A	rum's so
B	Jagermeister's taste
A	you know what? cos I put it in the er with the energy drinks I don't remember what it tastes like the Jager Bombs
B	no it's good when I had it at the
A	isn't it like herbal shit?
B	it's no no
A	it's like medicine?
B	it's it is it is medicinal
A	yeah
B	thing is when you take shots of vodka it's er it's so plain but when you take shots of Jagermeister it's good and it gets you more drunk
A	oh okay yeah yeah
B	but Jagermiester tastes but that's why it's so popular
B	that's why it tastes Jager Bombs that's why they're so popular
A	yeah yeah
B	when you go to the bar everyone just orders that I mean it's expensive as fuck
B	but it's good it's good
A	that's why I'm thinking like drinking at home must be so much cheaper but just
B	cos it's so much cheaper and you have
A	yeah
B	unlimited alcohol yeah
A	yeah yeah er er a pint is four quid any any pub
B	if you have
A	like or three quid or you
B	enough people
A	right
B	enough space
A	yeah
B	and good speakers you are gonna have a good time cos that's what a club is it's
A	you're gonna have a good time
B	alcohol
A	yeah
B	speakers and music
A	yeah that's true yeah yeah
B	that's all it is
A	yeah
B	that's the only reason people go
A	have you ever been clubbing?
B	yeah and that
A	what was that like?
B	I went at the
A	so oh right right right yeah
B	it's good it was it's really it is really fun
A	so what did you do just dance and shit?
B	yeah it's just
A	and get drunk?
B	we dance we talk I mean you're so drunk it doesn't it's it is really fun it is
A	cool
B	I've only been twice and the first time wasn't really proper I didn't stay that long
A	yeah
B	second time I I stayed quite a bit
A	yeah
B	it's good
A	I dunno
B	it's good
A	I I dunno
B	yeah I I
A	there's something about the thought of it
B	the reason for club the the
A	yeah
B	reason I liked it is cos my alcohol was paid for by erm
A	yeah oh yeah
B	it wasn't by
A	yeah
B	my mate was so drunk he just took out his wallet and was like I'll pay for everything
A	really?
B	and we were he's not exactly rich but he's richer than us
B	he's got a full time job working in the NHS
A	right
B	not as a nurse but as a repair man
A	okay
B	so he gets paid a wage that's like the average for a family
A	okay
B	but he
A	how old is he?
B	he's nineteen
A	okay
B	so he gets it all to himself
A	shit wow
B	so for his age living with his parents he gets paid a lot
A	he's
B	yeah so he he pays for my drinks mostly
A	oh
B	so I liked it
A	yeah
B	cos my drinks were free and
A	yeah
B	it was fun I can imagine to be honest he spent forty pounds
A	yeah
B	fifty-five pounds something I think it was nine shots of Jager nine Jager Bombs
B	yeah yeah
A	okay
B	and nine Jager Bombs for like four people isn't a lot either
A	oh yeah yeah yeah oh it wasn't nine Jager Bombs
B	and it was
A	for one person? they shared it out okay
A	that's where it gets dangerous
B	yeah
A	cos the caffeine in it that's quite pure
B	that's like two Jager Bombs each which
A	yeah
B	will fuck you over
A	yeah
B	but it'll finish so quickly cos Jager you can't have what is you can't have as a drink you have it as a shot
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	it's er
A	I just don't think that aftertaste would be nice is it?
B	no it is nice
A	really? oh
B	you and you really can't remember?
A	er I I I remember like like some leaf shit
B	the party changing for the twenty-ninth to the thirtieth has fucked me over
A	have you done it?
B	er
A	have you changed to the thirtieth? the
B	you said it was twenty-ninth to the thirtieth yeah well you said it was the twenty-ninth
A	let me check
B	you told me when I was when I showed you the text from
A	yeah yeah it's the twenty-ninth it's not the thirtieth though
B	twenty well yeah but if I stay all night
A	oh oh yeah oh yeah to the
B	that really fucked me over
A	why? cos of the work thing?
B	cos I'll be working probably either New Year's Eve or New Year's Day
A	right
B	either one of those and then there's also a family party
A	shit yeah
B	I can miss that but I don't really want to
A	I get you and if it's a family party
B	cos it's it's quite rude
A	like
B	it's quite rude er?
A	but
B	New Year's Eve it's New Year's Eve
A	oh okay
B	and
A	and yeah can't you
B	we're we ours is the day before New Year's Eve
A	that's fine can't you
B	and then but
A	can't you do both?
B	I'm gonna be working within a few of those days
A	yeah
B	I can work the day of the party
A	right
B	I probably can't work the day after
B	and then if I go to the family party I probably can't work the day after that either
A	that bad?
B	I can ask my boss to take one of those days off
A	right
B	but not any more than two especially New Year's Eve or New Year's Day
A	okay but New Year's Eve
B	I don't I don't know how busy it'll be in our shop
A	shit
B	it'll be people trying to sell their own old junk to us
A	yeah
B	so it might be
A	yeah but Christmas
B	quite busy
A	time's always busier
B	yeah Christmas will be busy
A	yeah try and erm
B	yeah
A	just us lot
B	yeah well I'll take the thirtieth off and I can work any other day
A	okay yeah yeah
B	yeah that'll be fine
A	so good oh
B	yeah are we even halfway?
A	did you ever wanna be bartender? well I wanna learn how to make drinks not shitty drinks not like some
B	like this one
A	yeah I think it really impresses girls if you're like like taking a girl back to your place and then giving her some shitty energy drink concoction or some fucking whisky and coke it's just so shit but if you can make this
B	it's probably really easy to find online
A	yeah they're not even hard there was like a Youtube channel with a simple bartender or something
A	simple drinks or something and they like make so easy shit
B	bottles are expensive
A	yeah yeah
B	like how much was the Ciroc? like twenty pound was it?
A	cheapest you get cheapest you get is like twenty-two quid
B	yeah
A	erm but that's fine if you're only having if you only wanna get tipsy then you only need like a quarter of that really it's only when we have a party
B	you can
A	that it gets everyone
B	I dunno if I go to uni I will keep a bottle in my house I will keep like a I dunno a few bottles of rum maybe one or two bottles of vodka
A	yeah
B	and maybe some gin
A	yeah
B	I'll probably want to
A	I dunno
A	I just would people steal it? I dunno
B	what?
A	if you took alcohol
B	oh no that's a good point
A	that's why I think erm people always buy drinks when they go out they don't er they don't
B	yeah you're right right
A	that's why I think the nights out are so expensive cos you come to a bar and drinks are so expensive and you keep drinking and you wanna get drunk but you have to pay a lot so er that's why
B	maybe something like
A	yeah
B	they're gonna have a limit on alcohol
A	yeah
B	and how
A	what would they would they be able to find out? would they
B	no
A	find out?
B	yeah because if you get fucked up and then you fuck everything up
A	yeah yeah
B	you're fucked
A	yeah yeah
B	like you have to
A	yeah that's true and
B	I guess that's why a lot of people go out
A	yeah but they know you're gonna they know you're gonna drink cos it's uni isn't it? so
B	yeah
A	you know so but I mean
B	this if I'm if I'm living not in uni accommodation
A	yeah
B	you can buy alcohol
A	yeah
B	whoever is living with us just ask them to
A	that's true but I think there's a lot of broke kids that wanna try and get as much free alcohol at uni as possible
A	you fucking what? you won't fucking what?
B	I dunno I that's that's a really hard situation that
A	anyway what are you most looking forward to about uni?
B	the course
A	really? yeah that's good
B	I mean that's the reason you should want to go to uni
A	oh yeah fuck yeah
B	for the course
A	if you if you end up
B	it's not for the drinking
A	yeah I know
B	not for the going out for the course
A	absolutely
B	like straight up the course is what I'm looking forward to
A	good
B	whatever uni I like that I go to as long as I like the course bar
A	what about
B	but it is in the middle apparently it's the deadest uni
A	really?
B	in the country yeah
A	I'm sure that's just like
B	it's it's in the middle of
A	yeah
B	that's what a lot of people found with a lot of campus unis
A	right
B	middle of nowhere
A	right but I mean
B	even even
A	but I think you kind of create your
A	the university is so yeah it's so live like they have more clubs there you have more time to go to clubs than
B	oh like bars and stuff?
A	it's anywhere else yeah like they have a lot of clubs
B	will you be a bartender at uni? oh we were
B	we were going on about it with
A	what's that?
B	like to be a bartender?
A	erm
B	I think it would be
A	not a bartender but just to find out how to make drinks so
B	I think I think being a bartender would like you get to know
A	yeah if you get behind a bar
B	you you get to talk to lots of people
A	yeah
B	and you're making cocktails
A	yeah and then you could learn how to make those cocktails which ones are the best so maybe I will train as a bartender that's what I wanna do train as a bartender so I can er
B	and you work at a bar for a bit
A	yeah yeah just do it I dunno I dunno how easy it is
B	I'm eighteen now I'm eighteen so I can
A	oh you could do it yeah can you serve alcohol at eighteen though?
B	yeah yeah
A	don't you have to be? oh right yeah
B	you can serve alcohol it's the the biggest problem is like
A	yeah
B	will have to be during the day
A	right
B	and no one drinks
A	yeah yeah
B	so at most I'll be selling beers
A	yeah yeah
A	yeah work at
B	I work at a club
A	yeah er
B	and when I when I went to the club I was like I dunno how these bartenders keep it up but
A	yeah
B	like everyone's so fucking drunk the music's so loud how they can hear anything
A	it's crazy you probably get used to it
B	yeah
A	all they really did was serve beer though so erm
B	I think when it gets late in the clubs
A	yeah I don't think you
B	I dunno what I heard is like a lot of bartenders at uni get drunk as well
A	right
B	that's what
B	people do
A	they just like sneakily like take a shot of
B	I mean working a bar for a student union
A	no it's true yeah
B	if you
A	how to make this okay I wanna make a copy
B	write it down
A	yeah
B	google it Youtube it
A	yeah yeah
B	three percent?
A	yeah should take a picture of that menu or I can look it up online
A	sorry sorry so easy to analyse something I have so many leftover fucking limes from the party cos I made like three we used one and er
B	really?
A	they're not they're not they're not great they're not great
B	well oh so are you looking to make so everything you made was from the erm
A	from the book yeah so I wanna use tofu there's this thing called miso paste which is they describe as pure
B	that's
A	and then I wanna cook with some more rice that kind of thing you know they called for one of those to be like taken back to the store?
B	I am keeping it it's
A	oh if it explodes I'm sure you can't
A	is it good? like what was the problem? they're like overheating or something?
B	overheating and they're like melting and
B	it's when people overcharge you
A	is it? it's cos like everyone every single phone operator suddenly started providing these that I I don't think they checked them enough
B	mm
A	properly so yeah
B	EE especially didn't check them
A	yeah yeah yeah EE just like
B	because they wanted to be the first ones
A	yeah I know
B	which was which was quite stupid I
A	yeah yeah
B	they can track it on my account as well
A	track it?
B	so yeah I'm on a contract they know they've given you
A	oh right yeah
B	they know I haven't given it back
A	yeah the haven't given mine back but
B	are you going to?
A	yeah probably you have to pay twenty quid if you don't give it back don't you?
B	really?
A	yeah it it it if you lose it or something they say it's free but if you lose it you have to pay twenty quid that's why it it's like it's like in two years they're gonna call for them all back and you have to pay twenty quid but I dunno what it's like now because they've all
A	they've called them all back
A	mine is
B	this is this is
A	it's twenty quid anyway it's twenty quid so you know
B	twenty quid for something where you use quite regularly
A	I wanna see whether my phone works with it now but now that I can charge with it it's fucking great
B	yeah but it's only charged
A	er?
B	do you need to use the elastic bands now?
A	I
B	that's good that's what I do yeah
A	so yeah so I'm I'm well pleased with it so yeah but yeah so
B	what else are you
B	how do you
A	so
B	decide what you wanna? don't tempt me actually no
A	what?
B	don't tempt me
B	I will you know I will
A	don't tempt you yeah?
A	it's like with you and sugar
B	so like the stuff you're finding in the book is it random? or are you going for
A	erm they have a main meal section and I'm just working through those so I've been in the first two but I need to buy ingredients like
B	do you live near a big supermarket? Tesco
A	Tesco's Tesco and Sainsbury's but
B	Tesco Extra?
A	the Sainsbury's is near our house so er near near our school in like two days or something erm
B	make a list of what you need to buy
A	yeah
A	miso miso whatever miso paste but tofu erm the rest is like just basic vegetables garlic shit I can get from my local supermarket so but
B	I can't believe they got me edible anuses
B	why couldn't get a cookbook?
A	yeah I
A	er edible
A	yeah yeah shit it did not taste good shit did not taste good
B	er okay that is strong that one
A	what that? it's good though
B	that's
A	yeah this is like coffee strong I like it but that's just like sour
B	oh I paid ten quid for it I'm gonna finish it
A	yeah oh fuck yeah
B	oh
A	I need a
B	well
A	I I know you're like you're no one's friend as well
B	for what?
A	but like you've really been there a lot for me
B	it's fine
A	in this situation
B	I I really enjoy it like
A	no no I really appreciate it though
B	if I'm honest I never had these good times with like
A	right right yeah yeah
A	oh yeah I've got got friends right now
B	they were never those people they will never
A	yeah yeah
B	as you lot are
A	yeah
B	they never were willing to spend time or effort to sort of they just stayed
A	yeah
B	stay home evenings
A	yeah yeah yeah obviously I've got problems with fucking mum and
B	no well what your lot
A	I I
B	especially
A	yeah
B	what you guys showed me is that it's so easy to just step away from old friendships that you're not enjoying
A	yeah
B	just disconnect yourself from them
A	yeah yeah
B	without being rude
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	and that that's really helpful that's
A	oh fuck yeah yeah realising that if people are
B	yeah I can't I can't have that
A	and he was making my life worse cos honestly with you guys I've just been able to be myself so much more that than I have before in terms of all kinds of things I've just been able to accept who I am rather than you know always having to be conforming to what people want me to be you know so
B	I think
A	yeah
B	they've just been so fun so
A	oh
B	so nice
A	yeah yeah
B	and that's really it's really has to have that like cos none of them are academics they're all
A	right
B	which is like
A	yeah yeah which
B	so it's like it's really
A	they're the worst what the fuck?
B	it's it's a really bad uni
A	yeah yeah
B	also they're not exactly the smartest
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	or they they've been like school dropouts college dropouts and it's really nice to have that different perspective
A	yeah I'm sure it is yeah
B	I dunno how you want to drink yours so
A	it's so good man
B	my sister
A	it's quite good oh no might be good I dunno letting them see you properly
A	yeah
B	and tell my sisters drinking's really bad out
A	yeah
B	so she won't drink out she will only drink with her friends
A	oh that's better though you drink with your friends than just getting out and getting drunk with people you don't know
A	it starts at like seven so
B	where is it?
A	er my auntie's sixtieth like any other party I'd just ditch but it's kind of like yeah yeah
B	sixtieth?
A	she bought she's the one that bought all the drinks for my party and everything and she's like
B	oh the only white auntie you have
A	the
B	how old is she? sixty?
A	sixty-sixty yeah so she just retired this year and got married so
B	oh oh that's
A	er
A	oh no no so it's kick-off is at three right? I think it's at three so
B	it'll finish it'll finish by
A	five?
B	five six and it's
A	five six
B	and it's it's only in
A	yeah no yeah
B	so it's it's
A	that's fine then but then I we I get home maybe an hour an hour and a half and then my mum will drive me so I can go to it
B	thing is I have no fucking
A	eat the beans
B	no
B	no no
A	if I
B	I honestly
A	if I didn't have the
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	she lives a five minute walk away from
A	really?
B	so whenever I went to Twickenham I'd go on my own with my sister with friends
A	yeah
B	or with erm my dad er we would always go to their house park up their house and walk I've never been there by public transport
A	shit erm we can google it I mean obviously
B	I
A	we can find out how but
B	I've been to I've caught the bus to
A	yeah
B	and it's like a half an hour walk I dunno that that might be viable
A	if it's if it's
B	might be
A	better than cos they have suggested routes for like where it won't be so busy if you take the normal route then it's like
B	the thing is like if you go to
A	yeah
B	and there's no traffic cos you're walking
A	yeah er there's I've never been to a like I went to a couple of Chelsea matches and like you either
B	really?
A	yeah you either go to er
B	well that's that's because
A	quieter
B	there's a tube
A	yeah yeah
A	oh shit yeah
B	it's it's on the outskirts
A	shit yeah
B	that's what I was thinking
A	but they have the train they have a train
B	they do they do so it'll be so busy it might not be worth it that's that's why I'm thinking
A	okay yeah we can walk to
B	well walk from
A	what about afterwards? walk from it?
B	when I went I went with
A	yeah
B	er walked out to it and walked back to
A	okay
B	and it was really easy
A	was it good? okay yeah let's do that if it if it's not as busy then the
B	the
A	really close to my house so I can get picked up from there or something or I'll yeah that'll work that'll work out that'll work out
B	that's the main problem for me like the reason I come to
A	yeah
B	there's a direct train
A	right
B	but for
A	what about from
B	I'd have to go to
A	really?
B	the easiest way
A	shit
B	is if I somehow get to
A	right
B	go to
A	erm
B	but I've never
A	you could get on the
B	yeah maybe
A	yeah
B	I I was just fairly sure there's a direct er route cos
A	oh yeah
B	on my train journey here through national rail
A	yeah
B	we go past there there's the stop at
A	yeah
B	like that's just there
B	my train passes right to next
B	why did it have to be football?
A	yeah they do play rugby sometimes there though like every now and then yeah
B	I went to the last time they played there Saracens
A	really?
B	Harlequins
A	yeah
B	it was a good match
A	what's the atmosphere like at a good match?
B	it's er so
A	I've never been
B	it's so
A	yeah
B	it's so good it's so it depends
B	it depends actually
A	yeah
B	I went to Twickenham
A	yeah
B	to watch erm
A	yeah yeah
B	and the atmosphere was amazing
A	oh yeah you went to that
B	cos
A	yeah
B	it was mostly Northampton fans and I was a Northampton fan so the atmosphere was great it's so much friendlier than football
A	really?
B	so much friendlier than football
A	yeah
B	er there's no
A	did they not? oh really? okay
B	but it's still really good I mean
A	that's alright you don't need alcohol
B	watching rugby in itself is so much more entertaining than football
A	yeah yeah
B	entertaining and football is so boring
A	yeah yeah
B	compared to rugby
A	I get that and you only
B	especially us we know exactly what's happening like
A	exactly I won't know any of the
B	at the time
A	I don't know the players though
B	I I know the players

B	who else plays for Bath?
A	er
B	Bob Webber

B	er Dave Denton Scottish number eight

B	Maro Itoje do you know him?
A	is he
B	Nigerian
A	Nigerian
A	shit is he fast?

B	because he captained the under twenty-one team when they won
A	okay
B	at New Zealand
A	that's that's awesome yeah yeah yeah
B	erm Saracens who else?
A	who's top of the Premiership at the moment?
B	Saracens they haven't lost a game this season
A	shit who's second?
B	er who's second? Exeter?
A	oh right
B	Exeter Chiefs they're they're set
A	yeah?
B	they've got Henry Slade
A	oh yeah
B	the they only played one
A	okay
B	but he played
A	yeah
B	er Geoff Parling
A	yeah yeah er
B	erm Thomas Waldrom
A	they're sick
B	they're a really cool team they're a really cool team they're second they're second in the
A	yeah
B	Premiership
A	do they most teams have like a lot of foreign players? or just mostly English players?
B	mostly English
A	okay
B	er Northampton only have
A	yeah yeah of course yeah
B	it's not like football where most of the team is foreign
A	yeah
B	erm
B	the team
A	okay
B	that's why I don't like it so Ma'a Nonu
A	right yeah
B	Leigh Halfpenny
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	there's Armitage brothers
A	yeah
B	they're both English er Ali Williams All Blacks captain will be
A	dunno oh right yeah er
B	I I think he's retired now
A	yeah
B	so erm so they've both got Armitage brothers er Mamuka Gorgodze he's the captain for Georgia
A	okay
B	I they've got a sick Matt Giteau
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	er they used to have Jonny Wilkinson
A	oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah he played for
B	Brian Smith I mean most of their starting team is foreign
A	okay yeah
B	that's why I don't like them Clermont as well
A	why do you not like them because of that?
B	because they're foreign the it's not a
A	okay
B	French team
A	oh it's er
B	it's a international team
A	they've played for a Premiership
B	a lot of their players can't speak French
A	oh really?
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	which is fine but a lot of the other players can't
A	so how are they trained? do they just speak in English or
B	in the
A	oh right
B	so that's the Champions Cup erm round four's just finished the next two rounds are in January
A	okay
B	the third second week of January and there are three rounds happening then
A	yeah
B	and those are the last two rounds before the quarter finals
A	in January there's the
B	yes yes
A	okay I I hear that the French are like
B	yeah
A	way better
B	so there were three good French teams Toulouse
A	yeah
B	who have won three
A	yeah
B	titles
A	yeah
B	but they've lost every game this season for the Champions Cup
A	yeah
B	Toulon who have won two titles
A	yeah
B	they are the reigning champions they've won the last two or three I
A	okay
B	yeah I think three or two
A	yeah
B	I can't remember erm
B	so yeah they've obviously been playing well
A	yeah
B	erm and then Clermont er
A	right
B	oh Clermont which is they're quite good they have Nick Venton do you know who Nick Venton is?
A	no I don't
B	David Strettle Jonathan
A	oh right
B	the Frenchman er not Frenchman Welshman
A	right
B	they they're playing quite well oh erm Harlequins also have er
A	okay
B	he's sick yeah Clermont are good and then Racing Metro they have Dan Carter
A	okay
B	so they're also really good so four French teams
A	where do where do most of like New Zealand and Australia's players play?
B	France
A	is there a league? oh France yeah yeah
B	so and erm
A	south
B	Australian
A	okay yeah
B	Australian have South African players
B	but
A	yeah yeah
B	but because they don't get paid a lot
A	they have their own league don't they?
B	yeah so it's Super Rugby but Super Rugby doesn't pay a lot erm
A	does it not?
B	no
A	oh right
B	because if you imagine like the population of New Zealand
A	yeah
B	the population of France and then that that amount going to rugby games
A	yeah
B	it's much greater in France so they get a lot
A	they have enough to like transport each other to all the different like stadiums or
B	cos that's
A	is that minimal compared to like
B	yeah I think that's minimal like the highest amount of money a team in the Premiership the English Premiership
A	yeah
B	can spend is much less than I think something like three times less than the shittest team in the French league
A	really? fucking hell
B	that's why they all
A	that's a big difference
B	go to France
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	cos they get there's no salary cap in England
A	yeah
B	there is but in France there isn't
A	yeah
B	that's why French rugby's kind of open like before that it used to be very much Irish dominated
A	yeah
B	so er Irish and Scottish so Glasgow warriors erm
A	Leinster
B	and Munster
A	yeah
B	they used to win all the time
A	okay yeah
B	but they they haven't been doing so well
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	they've been losing
A	okay yeah our
B	which is
A	cause used to be Munster and Leicester at rugby our wins er
B	erm
A	okay so what's what's good about the English league?
B	English players I think
A	oh right
B	you get to see them
A	play basically yeah
B	English clubs are dominating the European scene at the moment
A	yeah?
B	two weeks ago in the second round of the Championship
A	yeah
B	erm that's the first round ever
A	yeah right
B	which an English team won every single er all the English team won all their matches
A	really? shit
B	so Wasps beat Toulon
A	yeah
B	and Toulon is the dream team at home
A	yeah
B	that was massive
A	oh
B	that's what I was telling
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	because Toulon are the Barcelona of football they are
A	oh I see
B	the richest they are the best team by far er they can't really be dominated apart from maybe Clermont and stuff like that
B	English English teams after the world cup after embarrassing themselves
A	yeah
B	are playing really really really well
A	how come do you think?
B	I dunno I mean
A	are they inspired?
B	Exeter
A	yeah
B	er four years ago they were in the second division
B	of English rugby er after getting promoted they are now second in the league and they beat Clermont
A	shit
B	one of the the runners up of last season's Champions Cup
A	yeah
B	at home which was amazing
A	wow sounds sick
B	er
A	so are Northampton still in the er
B	Northampton are good
A	Champions Cup?
B	yeah yeah they're in the Champions Cup
A	yeah
B	they won the Premiership two years ago
A	oh okay
B	they were
A	yeah
B	erm we were playing we're playing badly this season we lost our first three games but we've won everything since then
A	right
B	which er apart from the last game we lost to Racing Metro away
A	right
B	actually yeah
A	yeah yeah
B	I mean
A	why do you support them? or what made you support them?
B	Courtney Lawes
A	oh right
B	Courtney Lawes but I
A	oh was he your favourite player?
B	I I like he was my
A	yeah yeah
B	and then I started to get to know the Northampton team
A	yeah
B	we won the Premiership then
A	oh yeah fair enough
B	and now I mean how can I not support them?
A	yeah I get it yeah
B	erm my second favourite team is Exeter no
A	okay oh I see yeah
B	and I used to go and watch all the matches
A	really?
B	with my mates yeah
A	shit shit
B	and it's only after they left that I started to like them
A	really?
B	but yeah
A	yeah
A	didn't they use to dominate
B	they have
A	a lot more?
B	they have a lot
A	oh
B	but the reason they're so good
A	yeah
B	they are I think like fourth
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	in the Premiership erm they're doing really well in Europe as well
A	what happened like wasn't it like five years ago they won it every year didn't they? but they were like
B	yeah
A	so dominating
B	yeah they used to be really good they used to be dominant I think
A	yeah yeah
B	was but now they have hardly any
A	I see
B	erm there are only five teams in the Champions Cup from
A	okay
B	from England
A	from England
B	and Wasps are the one of them
A	I see
B	so they're playing well erm Wasps have amazing players really good players
A	yeah
B	which all should have been in the England team
A	yeah
B	but I can think think of two people that should have definitely been in England team
A	yeah
B	that weren't or at least in the training squad erm Elliot Daly
A	yeah
B	you he's only twenty-four he will definitely be in England and then Joe Simpson who's quite old but he was the best scrum half in the Premiership last season
A	really?
B	I mean I dunno I dunno what it is with Wasps but they're just not they are a team of young people
A	yeah
B	like their back line is no older than twenty-five
A	oh really?
B	the majority of it's twenty-three to twenty-five
A	really?
B	they also got Charles Piutau do you know him? All Black number fifty
A	oh okay
B	erm not recently but
A	yeah yeah
B	their back but he's he's really good he's been really
A	yeah
B	and then
A	okay
B	he's also a All Blacks winger
A	right
B	for a few years ago
A	he is?
B	so that's helped them in their and do you remember Christian Wade is? he he played for
A	oh yeah you told me
B	he played for the Irish Lions
A	okay okay
B	er he's injured so
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	but Wasps are definitely contenders for the
A	for the Champions yeah
B	this season
A	yeah
B	will be not Bath they're too shit at the moment
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	I mean Northampton beat them away at Bath
A	yeah
B	so they're playing pretty badly Saracens Northampton Exeter Wasps Leicester
A	yeah
B	those would be my contenders for the title but I think it might be too early to say
A	yeah yeah I see so much of an effect does the manager have? cos like is that
B	erm
A	is that why Wasps are doing badly like?
B	the manager doesn't have much effect on it
A	really? oh right
B	they're just there for the money
A	it's not like football
B	and for the players
A	yeah yeah
B	so like to buy a new players that that would be for the manager but it's not like football there isn't a transfer window
A	right
B	it's just at the beginning of the season you buy new players
A	oh right
B	during the season you can't change that
B	so those Louis Picamole is coming to Northampton at the start of next season
A	yeah
B	he's playing for his French team Toulouse at the moment erm but yeah it's it's not much
A	yeah
B	the coach
A	okay yeah
B	does a lot I mean he picks the teams
A	oh the coach
B	he does all the interviews
A	oh okay right
B	the manager though oh no that's just the money
A	so the coach that does all the training and stuff? okay
B	the coach with his assistants
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	so like if you think about Stuart Lancaster nothing no one higher than him did anything it was him and lower that did everything
A	oh yeah yeah yeah
B	so Ian Richie the head of the RFU
A	yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
B	he did nothing
A	oh that's true yeah that's it I'll try and watch I'll I'll try and watch some more would it would it be good just to
B	yeah
A	you know watch
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	the er yeah
B	like
A	cos the they think like
B	Champions Cups are so you know how there's your Europa League? there's the equivalent of that in rugby
A	okay
B	er it's called the
A	yeah
B	but that's like the second division so like every team's in that
A	right
B	erm but the Champions League it's only the best teams
A	the top ones yeah yeah yeah
B	so excluding the Italian contributions
A	yeah they're
B	all the teams are good yeah the Italian contributions are
A	so who is it between? England France Italy
B	England well so the
A	the Champions Cup thing
B	the Welsh Italian Scottish and Irish people they have their own league
A	yeah
B	called the Pro12
A	oh
B	erm
A	what are they generally lower
B	yeah
A	quality of rugby?
B	four teams from Ireland
A	yeah
B	four teams from Wales
A	yeah
B	two teams from Scotland two teams from the Italy er
A	cool
B	but they all get people like their own individual regions I think it's the top two
A	yeah
B	or top three yeah top three in is it top three?
A	yeah
B	yeah I think it's top three I think it's the top three from Ireland
A	right
B	top two from Wales
A	yeah
B	top from erm Scotland and the top from Italy
A	okay
B	erm that get through that's in the Pro12
A	yeah
B	both Italy teams are always at the bottom always
A	really?
B	without fail they're both always at the bottom so the best
A	oh they're shit
B	Italian team is still really shit
A	yeah is still gonna be the worst right
B	yeah so
A	kind of like
B	yeah
A	they're they're shit
B	the and then the French league is the top fourteen they get I think four or five
A	yeah yeah it sounds cool
B	yeah erm
A	I'll probably watch that
B	do you have Sky Sports or BT Sports?
A	er
B	either er
B	stream
A	so I'm very most of the time I only watch
B	streaming
A	international but er yeah I'll stream
B	erm
A	on ITV4 but that's
B	get the app
A	yeah
B	Ultimate Rugby
A	oh yeah you told me about that
A	where do they have highlights for er the Champions then?
B	it's not highlights
A	no are are are there highlights
B	they don't have highlights
A	for the Champions Cup though?
B	no there may be but er they are pretty hard to find
A	yeah
B	they're very hard to find like
A	oh right
B	and if erm and football it's so easy to find highlights
A	yeah
B	it's like here it's like every team from the Champion stuff
A	yeah
B	er the second division like the Europa Leagues the
A	do you think it inspires you to play though?
B	yeah
A	right
B	definitely definitely
A	watching it? yeah yeah
B	but I think mainly it's more down to laziness
A	really? yeah yeah yeah
B	because
A	I couldn't deal with the training that's the main thing I can't train it's so takes it so out of you you're like
B	but but like for you it's hard I understand because you have to catch
A	right
B	a a train
A	yeah yeah yeah no I have to
B	to go to
A	no I I cycle there always cycled there
B	that's even worse
A	but my bike's been shit recently so
B	that's even worse like
A	but it it kept me really fit in year eleven and twelve but not anymore I just
B	but that takes away too much of your time
A	yeah it
B	even for me my club's like going on a Thursday night
A	yeah
B	finishing quite late just really takes it out of you and then when I have to catch a bus in the morning at
A	yeah
B	six o'clock
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B sometimes finishes very late.	Entailment
B	at six thirty it's er it's just too much
A	I get you to be quite honest with the er with the people at
B	right right
A	there are a couple of others who are really awesome but a lot of them were dicks a lot of them were real dicks
B	really?
A	like they weren't dicks to me particularly but I just like
unknown_female	excuse me
A	right
unknown_female	excuse me could we
B	it was very similar to me the majority of the A team were complete arseholes
A	yeah
B	all the B team I was really close friends with
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	so that's why I found it easy cos when you went to B game matches none of the A team players would be there or only
A	oh right
[ANNOTATION]	Speker B didn't know anyone from the B team.	Contradiction
B	about two of them would be there
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	so I'd have a great time
A	I see
B	with you you only really had one team
A	we had one team so it's really like that's it between people I mean I get on with everyone there now but it's just like tours were always sick I love the tours like the two tours I went on were the best things ever I got I got drunk just had a good time but er and and er I'd really like to get to see cos like before that I had you know an
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B had a very pleasant time.	Entailment
