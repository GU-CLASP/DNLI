A	here we are hello
B	hi
A	hi
A	not that I only ever come to see you just so we can do recordings
B	oh
A	they're really moist aren't they?
B	yeah
B	mm
A	I think they're the best I usually get erm
B	mm
A	just a pack cos you get a bumper pack for buttons
B	mm
A	mm
B	yes thanks do you want a cup of tea?
A	I'd love a cup of tea thank you very much
B	erm
A	mm how was that?
A	mm
B	and the other one is sort of a little fat dwarf man
B	he's like the Toad of Toad Hall
A	chalk and cheese
B	English is rubbish
A	oh no
B	er and the third one is this
A	oh yes you said you'd got a pregnant judge
B	before the first
A	trimester thingy
B	before the end of the first trimester
A	mm
B	and she said I've not told anyone else at work I'm only telling you
A	what?
A	cos you don't have the language to gossip
B	well yeah
A	wow
B	er in this job so far
A	yeah
B	er there is some kind of sort of
A	mm
B	in their brain it's okay to tell me but they won't tell their colleagues
A	yeah that's weird
B	so when I said to
A	ah
A	oh shit
B	or you know all of these things and I can't sort of push it
B	cos they might not know that's why she's not at work
A	so they don't know that you know
B	exactly
A	but then you don't know for sure that they know
B	that they know so I sort of
A	so you suspect that they know you suspect that they think that you won't know even though you know
B	yeah because the end of this first trimester was during winter break so she
A	oh okay
B	er but you know the sad I might've told you this before I'm not sure maybe I did
A	woah
B	she hadn't told you know her extended family but then she lost the baby so
A	ah shit
B	I know so I think she sort of
A	yeah
B	and that was just the worst lesson I've ever had in my whole life
A	jeez I'm sure
B	erm
A	was it
B	mm mm
A	ah
B	yeah it was awful it was awful so I just sort of
A	and hard for her to express something so emotional
B	yeah
A	and so deep in her second language or third
B	I
A	yeah
B	er you know and we had to sort of go through the vocabulary for the whole thing
A	oh
B	which was really not what I'd expected to have to do
A	yeah
B	er and I don't think well she didn't
B	I really hope
A	shit I hope she's alright
A	yeah
B	erm
A	fuck
B	no
B	my new kettle
A	it's gorgeous I love the green
B	it's nice isn't it?
A	yeah
B	and it sort of blends with my sort of plant theme
A	plants I know oh shit yes remind me to give you plants before I
B	yeah please do
A	leave the country
B	erm but it's a slow boiler but we can't have everything in life
A	well we looked at that didn't we?
A	and it was eighteen hundred watts
B	for the money
A	yeah and there were others that were something like two point two kilowatts but
B	yeah
A	we took the decision no that's too much money so I think that's fair enough
B	yeah
A	yeah what's cooking?
B	I made some soup
A	good for you
A	yeah
B	with some veg
A	yeah
B	uhu
A	who died erm I mean it was expected he's
B	yeah cos I remember you said
A	yeah
B	this was ages ago
A	really feel for her though cos there's the G six so us six girls and
B	uhu cos she didn't come to
A	yeah she didn't come to Krakow
B	to Krakow
A	that's right yeah so it's the G six girls so now there are five and one
B	uhu
A	the other side of the veil so erm yeah only five in the physical now erm
B	yeah
A	they were brilliant and
B	yeah the sort of loss
A	around parents and partners
B	yeah
A	and I remember
B	mm mm
A	someone very very close to you
B	yeah
A	erm and she almost wanted to have that experience to be able to better empathise
B	mm mm
A	and and then I you know I think now be careful what you wish for Jesus she lost her mum
B	yeah
A	he's had Alzheimer's and all sorts of other health issues and has been going downhill steadily for a couple of years
B	yeah that's very sad
A	and she's an only child so it's been really hard on her you know being the primary carer
B	yeah yeah
A	erm I tell you what's weird though erm
B	uhu
A	and has she's popped out baby
B	uhu
A	no baby
B	uhu
B	mm
A	and
B	pregnant again
A	yeah
B	mm oh my god
A	isn't that crazy?
B	that's weird yeah weird cycle
A	I mean I'm a firm believer in other lives
B	uhu
A	and a firm believer in soul families and I don't think it's always so literal but I think in the case of these guys it really is that literal
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	it's like one out one in
B	uhu
A	you know? it's weird
B	uhu
A	aspect of a soul that's coming in but you know it just struck me as a bit crazy are you not having one?
B	no cos I've had too much coffee today
A	ah
B	I feel
A	I hate when someone makes you a brew and then doesn't have one yourself
B	I'm sorry
A	bad friend
B	no you're welcome it's just I've just finished this coffee and I thought oh my god I've had too much already
A	ah
B	erm so
A	I know when you get to that point sometimes where you get the shakes with the caffeine
B	and I keep getting headaches I had to take painkillers the other night for headaches
A	yeah?
B	from having too much coffee and not enough water I think
A	mm
B	I know
A	yeah
B	mm
A	so yeah so erm
A	yeah Krakow at ten past two gets me in at ten past four to Belfast erm of course three-hour flight minus the hour
B	uhu
A	erm
B	okay
A	and it's pretty good considering it's short notice return trip for a hundred quid
B	that's good
A	so can't grumble at that
B	uhu
A	yeah very good
B	I am
A	not that
B	usually
A	good
B	far more organised than I actually am
A	Post-its are great as long as they don't fall off
B	they keep falling off yeah
A	mm
B	unfortunately your
A	yeah
B	these are terrible but they're really useful for Spanish I just sort of write stuff down that I can't
A	oh good for you
B	if I can't remember
A	yeah
B	if I write it down it makes it a bit easier but I've got
A	ah
A	that might take five minutes might take an hour
B	yeah er and I'm just a bit not pissed off
A	uhu
B	especially like upper intermediate you have
A	yeah
B	and I do part B?
A	yeah
A	oh
B	nearly the second semester
A	shit
B	erm
A	and how many units are in the book?
B	ten
A	oh
B	it's not essential that we finish the book but
A	actually it is second semester now isn't it?
B	yeah it's like the er middle of February
A	doesn't it start this week?
B	yeah erm we should've finished unit four I'm up to unit four but I can't do it because I need her to do part A before I do part B cos the grammar in it
A	ah shit
B	you need this part of the grammar to do
A	link into that
B	this part of grammar
A	can you start on five B and then go back to four B?
B	well yeah that's what I thought maybe if I just do all of the
A	or can you do A?
B	all of the reading and listening
A	you do A and she does B
B	yeah I might ask if we
A	cos it's it's not a specific
B	no no no
A	so yeah
A	A and she can do B
B	cos I'm just like ah
A	and
B	I can't do anything I'm just having to create like bullshit lessons
A	yeah
B	to fill the time for her to catch up which is fine because it's like lots of conversation or doing things a little bit differently
A	yeah
B	and
A	mm
B	and hers is do it really slowly methodically make sure it goes in the first time
A	okay
B	and I think we just have different styles
A	different styles yeah
B	cos I would you know fly through it and then just keep going back over it keep going back over it give it a couple of weeks review it give it a couple of weeks review it but
A	mm
B	which I think it
A	mm
B	yeah exactly
A	yeah
B	but I'm just like in no man's land there's really
A	yeah
B	but
A	yeah see about that and then you can lumber her with the grammar hooray
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah or
A	mm
B	anyway
A	hooray cos you'll be all prepared what's today? Tuesday so prep Monday Tuesday
[ANNOTATION]	Grammar exercises are hard.	Neutral
B	Wednesday
A	is it Wednesday?
B	yeah
A	how did that happen?
B	I don't know
A	lost a day
B	yeah it's Wednesday
A	yeah
B	today which is like my big day
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A missed two days.	Contradiction
A	what? big as in lots of teaching?
B	yeah well it's the most hours
A	yeah
B	and it's er only seven point three three which isn't as many as your Monday used to be but
A	Monday
B	uhu yeah to do
A	mm
B	it's not so bad and the last two lessons I've already done on Monday and Tuesday so
A	mm
B	it's fine
A	just looking at your bulging folder I've got one of those you can have
B	oh please can I have it? er erm
A	yeah
B	I don't know why I hang onto all this stuff I really just need to bin it because I don't actually need it I'm not gonna
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B cannot get rid of things he/she doesn't need.	Contradiction
B	use it
A	woah
B	for yeah after year after year
A	oh okay
B	and I thought well that's great but I
A	but
B	there's no point me
A	I know no point you because you're moving country
B	yeah so
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B will go to China.	Neutral
A	yeah and probably by plane not car
B	so I've got all of this stuff
A	yeah
B	bits and pieces until the end of the year
[ANNOTATION]	A truck will be used for the travelling.	Contradiction
A	it'd be handy if you could get the job and know
B	yeah and then well everything's saved or a lot of it's saved
A	yeah
B	I've got er
A	or just say fuck it for what you've missed and carry on from today
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B needs a job.	Entailment
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	don't know so feeling quite organised productive
A	good you're sounding and looking organised and productive
B	yes
A	yeah good
A	yeah
B	so yeah
A	yeah
B	what's ninja yoga?
[ANNOTATION]	A has done ninja yoga with their mum friends.	Neutral
A	well
B	do you have to wear black and a
A	no I kinda made that up it's not actually called ninja yoga but I felt like a ninja it was weird
B	how many people are in the group? tell me all about it
A	erm there were oh god I'm so unobservant I feel energy more than look around me so I think there were probably about five at the back six seven eight plus the teacher
B	okay
A	all women all
B	uhu
A	teacher woman I'm sure she's older than me but oh my god what a body and how fit is she?
B	mm
A	she's amazing and the positions she gets
A	that shouldn't be humanly possible
[ANNOTATION]	The teacher and the other women were wearing matching outfits.	Neutral
B	uhu
A	but it is she's so strong she's incredible anyway yeah so we had erm mats blankets big poof things
B	uhu
A	wooden block things straps and we were just doing these holds and working with a partner for a time as well I worked with an older lady called
B	mm
A	actions that you never perform in daily life
B	uhu
A	and she's very fussy about posture and about the action that you do
[ANNOTATION]	The teacher is probably older than her and a bit weak.	Contradiction
B	yeah yeah yeah your technique
A	and doing it perfectly correctly which is great gives you reassurance erm that she's a good teacher and nobody's gonna get hurt
B	mm
A	all all get out alive but erm yeah it was
B	good how many minutes?
A	but it was good erm it's an hour and fifteen but
B	uhu
A	you do a lot of laying down flat on your back at the end with a blanket over you having a nice little rest and she does erm
B	oh nice
A	it's like a little sound bath to relax to at the end and I would guess that was more than fifteen minutes so it's probably about fifty fifty-five minutes of
[ANNOTATION]	The class lasted two and a half hours with some resting at the end.	Contradiction
B	mm
A	strange position
[ANNOTATION]	The teacher is quite careless.	Contradiction
B	mm mm
A	strange action ninja things erm
B	good
A	which is good
B	glad you like it I've only tried yoga once and it was ninety minutes
A	ninety minutes?
B	yeah
A	that's a lot
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B gave it a go once for an hour and a half.	Entailment
B	erm but I was just
A	mm
B	relax
A	yeah
B	the mind or whatever it's for me it's exercise and I didn't feel like I was getting any results
A	oh okay
B	and
A	mm and you didn't
B	I just didn't get it it's not for me I need exercise to really
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Person A is going to have a sandwich	Contradiction
B	you know to know that it's happened
A	you need to feel it
B	to push you to the limits yeah
A	yeah
B	and it's like oh we I can't remember what even what we did lots of stretching lots of positions handstands and all of this stuff and I just thought well
A	yeah
A	I've been to loads of classes in different countries and erm
B	mm
A	different teachers obviously and
B	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Person B is thinking of being teacher in different country	Neutral
A	and these particular movements that's the Wednesday class what I normally do of an evening is a lot more flowing
B	uhu
A	and harder work erm and I'm not the whatever's on Monday and Thursday mornings is the same and I was gonna go tomorrow but I'm off to the funeral now so I won't
B	mm
A	erm
B	mm
A	work I think Wednesday is like the masterclass of perfecting
B	mm
A	particular positions so yeah but
[ANNOTATION]	Person A is going to have a sandwich	Contradiction
B	mm
A	and that's erm on a Friday night I can't remember the woman's name now but oh my god that was an hour of hell
B	mm
A	I
B	uhu
A	sweating
[ANNOTATION]	Person A think that he couldnt remember the name of the woman that he saw on Friday	Entailment
B	uhu uhu
A	it's just really hard work but such a sense of achievement and the idea with that was that one move then flowed into another move
B	mm
A	and you'd maybe hold that for a few breaths and then you flow onto another move so different bits of your body got used or rested
B	mm
A	at different times and it was designed very well so that as you flowed from one to the other you got a bit of relief on the bit that had been shaking
B	mm
A	and worked another bit it was really good
B	mm
A	I think you'd love that
[ANNOTATION]	Person A think that you would love	Entailment
B	yeah er that
B	mm
A	so yeah
B	no well I don't know maybe one day I will try again
B	but at the time maybe it was just at the time
[ANNOTATION]	Person B think maybe it was just at the time	Neutral
A	mm
B	if I go on a Wednesday I just get a bit stressed that I should be doing something
A	yeah
B	something else erm
A	yeah
B	and then go
B	he was like mentally physically you need to be prepared
B	yeah he's er
A	you mean he hasn't already? you couldn't walk last Tuesday
A	or Wednesday
B	and I nearly cried on Monday
B	it was I
B	just so pathetic
A	gotta be done good for you
B	god I know
A	good for you
B	it's it's I just get really really like annoyed with myself if I can't do something
A	mm
B	and it's just so frustrating to not be able to do something and he's you know
A	yeah and no weights yeah
B	and I just feel so stupid and just like
A	but if he'd started with that exercise
B	yeah
A	you'd probably be fine but you know by the time you get there
B	yeah
A	and you've worked other muscles and other bits
B	that's true yeah
A	yeah
A	mm
B	but never mind
B	never mind it's all good fun and if I've got the money in March I'm gonna extend it for another
A	mm
B	er load
A	good for you
B	yeah
A	what does it cost a week?
B	well I paid a
A	mm
B	which works out at
A	sixty
B	you know it's like ten pound seventy-five
A	which is which is one student
B	a session
A	take
A	so
B	mm that's a good point
B	that's a good point
A	yeah
B	I mean it's super-expensive but if you say like it's ten pounds for all of these sessions in England I was paying thirty quid an hour
A	yeah
B	so for er you like in that respect it's not so expensive but I
A	I don't think it's pricey at all
B	no
A	that's fine
B	it's worth it
A	yeah
B	like I'd pay more er and the
A	mm
B	if you have a second child in Poland you get five hundred złoty per month for that child
A	right
B	er
A	oh okay
B	but if you have a high income er you don't get money for the first child if you have a low income you get money for the first child
A	mm
B	er and you know he was saying er I mean he was like I don't need the money so it's a bit of a shame that they don't do it by income because
A	yeah
B	he was like I'm not gonna say no but they're giving me this money that as a family we don't need and it should be going somewhere else
A	that they don't need
B	erm
A	yeah
B	so they're gonna
A	and have a baby yeah
B	and I just thought that is like no money at all
A	yeah
B	per
A	I know
B	for a woman's salary and er I didn't wanna say like what kind of jobs are you talking about?
A	it's
B	well it's a bit more about two
A	okay how much is it? what's the złoty?
B	er a thousand
A	a thousand okay yeah
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	yeah
B	he said between a thousand and twelve hundred is like the average salary of a woman
A	yeah
A	wow
B	but I don't know like what sort of job that would equate to
A	yeah
B	I mean
A	so you can understand how very well-educated Polish women come to the UK and work a
B	work uhu
A	fifty hour a week cleaning job for minimum wage
B	uhu uhu uhu
A	wow
B	erm and who was it?
A	jeez that's amazing
A	mm
B	and I think they got double
A	binmen get quite a lot actually
B	double as a binman as a lawyer in Poland
A	I applied to be a binman
B	it's must
B	mm
A	could've done it easy
B	er but
A	yeah
B	but at the same time it was like
A	mm
B	to stay at home and look after the kids it means there's gonna be no women in industries
A	yeah
B	all of like er the majority of the
A	even more so
A	mm
B	in the workplace
A	that is a lot of money if that's equivalent to a wage that's pretty crazy isn't it?
B	well that's what they said and that's why er in England and Germany it's not so much of a problem because there's a huge disparity between this sort of these benefits and wages
A	yeah
B	whereas here it's so similar that you can just swap one for the other
A	yeah
B	yeah so they said it's so stupid they should be putting money into free kindergartens or free childcare for
A	yeah childcare or whatever
B	erm and they said kindergartens and nurseries whatever they close at four
A	yeah
B	here
A	but then I suppose
A	yeah
B	but they should be open more so people can
A	but the new government is very religious and
B	traditional and conservative yeah
A	yeah and church-driven
B	mm
A	and at some level
B	yeah
A	deliberately seeks to
B	yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	would term the divine feminine
B	uhu
A	so that I guess is another step towards that you know potentially
B	it's very patriarchal as a religion
A	alienating women from other people who aren't women with children
B	mm
A	erm you know I'm not saying you can't be a a divine feminine standing in your power goddess and be a parent
B	mm mm
A	of course you can but I'd say that's less likely if your social circle
B	mm
A	is
B	mm
A	you know good luck to her if you like children erm
B	mm
A	an intelligent conversation
B	yeah
A	and find it very difficult to find the time and the people for that
B	and there's also this problem if you stay at home until your kids are eighteen and you stop getting this money
A	mm
B	are you gonna try are you gonna go back to work with er
A	yeah very true
B	relearn skills relearn everything? who's gonna wanna employ someone who's had a eighteen-year employment gap?
A	mm
B	erm
A	yeah
B	well yeah exactly
A	we are very different
B	yeah and and it's a shame
B	that my this female judge wasn't there today because you know she's the one who I was saying yesterday er who has got this sort of well I'm just gonna get a nanny why should I
B	why should I put myself through all the stress? you know
A	yeah
B	I'm important too I'm just gonna do whatever
A	good for her yeah
B	I was just like that's so great
B	like good on you for working hard you've got enough money and you're just like oh fuck it someone else can do all this stuff
A	yeah
B	she was telling me you know she was like I love reading and whenever she was like and god kids are boring so I'm just like driving this toy round and like reading my book
A	has she got children
B	yeah she's got a boy he's like two or three and she's just like fuck it this is so shit
A	Jesus
B	she wouldn't yeah er she's so kind of er progressive I think and she's in this erm
A	yeah
B	and you know she lived with boys at uni and she lived with her boyfriend before she was married and
A	mm
B	she lived on her own
A	mm wow that's unheard of
B	which is unheard of so she's just like
A	yeah
B	no bullshit
B	er I think
A	yeah
A	wow you know er you know everybody has a right to do what they want as they want I guess yeah but for me personally not having children definitely not wanting children and not particularly liking children
B	mm
B	yeah it's all influenced
A	I can really woo yeah all power to
B	uhu
A	I'm quite grateful actually that
B	mm
A	when are you getting married?
B	mm
A	when are you settling down? blah blah blah
B	I know I think I'm very lucky that I've never had that and no one in my
A	mm
B	I don't know what I've done in the past but they just wouldn't ever
A	yeah
B	ever ever ask I don't think even you know at Christmas and no one cares
A	that's good
B	yeah but I am the only single one so
A	yeah but you know single is a phase you're still perfectly whole and complete
B	I am absolutely
A	and
A	oh
B	just er beeping away
A	yeah
A	so I've been on DIVA Date a bit more
B	mm
A	and I've been erm yeah
A	they're so young oh my god and I think well er okay so I was young once but does that suggest there are no forty-something lesbians
B	uhu
A	in the whole of Eastern Europe or what?
A	yeah I mean there are there are a couple of thirty-somethings in Krakow and there's a bisexual forty-something in Romania but you think ah fuck's sake you know?
A	so yeah I kind of rely on er it's a bit like
B	mm
A	and you'll win and it's a bit the same cos you don't need to be surrounded by attractive ladies
B	uhu
A	and you know when the time is right erm and when I'm right you know in the right place
B	yeah it'll
A	then it'll happen but yeah so so I changed my location to
B	good
A	so erm
B	oh yeah that's good news
A	maybe I'll see when I'm driving through but then I think well actually you know I'm not gonna form any
B	so fleeting
A	loving committed relationship
B	of course er uhu
A	cos I'm fucking off back to Poland again but
B	I think that's a good point like I think we probably talked about this before
A	mm
B	I don't know
A	the outer reflects the inner and I think you almost need to get to that position where your level of self-love and level of self-fulfilment
B	mm
A	erm is such that
B	mm
A	you already feel like you have
B	yeah
A	you know all the love support and everything and then like attracts like you draw more to you
A	mm
B	said you know the algorithms just do not work
B	an English-speaking person in a radius of this flat
A	yeah
B	who is attractive who is interesting
A	yeah
B	who is not a complete dick and hasn't been sort of influenced
A	yeah
B	by
B	and like the cross-section of society is like zero people
A	I know
A	add in you know
B	I think I need to go younger in Poland for sure though
A	yeah
B	going older is not gonna do me any good
A	yeah
B	yeah I know I can't
A	I mean I know age is just a number but I can't imagine being with a twenty-something really it's just
B	I would er I don't know
A	mm
B	as a sort of teacher I would sort of draw the line at
B	but
A	yeah
B	it's legal erm
A	mm
B	yeah I know
A	so we'll see
B	cos they're not here
A	exactly
A	why don't they want to move to Poland?
B	mm
A	how do you feel about a
B	stupid life
A	few years exploring? I dunno
B	mm
A	so we'll see but anyway like I say I I think erm you know even against all the odds once you're ready and once
A	yeah
B	such a long time
B	if you know anybody
A	and on Facebook so
A	come find us
B	easily available
A	and I'll be in Cambridge briefly
B	and all social media outlets
B	would like to meet
A	dating a transcriber who knows so much about you
B	so much about my menstrual cycle it's ridiculous
A	that's true that would take it yeah
B	ah
A	that would take a little bit of time to
B	it would be very funny
B	okay er no offence but I'm gonna have to kick you out cos I need to do some
A	yeah
B	work
A	and then I need to get my frozen vegetables into a freezer
A	no euphemism intended
