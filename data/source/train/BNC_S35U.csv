B	absolutely
A	of course they do
B	every other house in um certain areas
A	you could build a bloody house there
B	er has got
A	if you came in a bit

B	have got a studio at the bottom of the garden
A	no
B	well it
A	mm
B	for people um
A	mm
B	staying
B	yeah
A	well power yeah I mean mm
B	I don't know how you'd do that
A	just put a cable under the ground and
B	yeah
B	yeah you'd need
A	er I was just thinking that I haven't bought a lottery ticket yet but
A	Cos um building a house there on my wages would be
B	well I mean it's a nice idea
A	mm
B	I'm sure somebody could do it
B	er of course
C	another project
B	I'm I'm sure they would
C	on the  on the  lot
B	absolutely
A	it depends
B	but if it's  if it's
C	it'd be single storey
B	single storey
A	well it could be the height that it is now really
B	absolutely
C	like the fence
A	mm
B	and er just a slightly pitched roof
A	yeah
B	so long as it's not completely flat
A	well you'd have it just going one way
B	yeah
C	mm
B	exactly
A	and have an apex roof
B	oh absolutely
A	mm
B	yeah
C	A house that I went to look at recently had a studio little
B	yeah
C	outhouse shed but
B	well Dido's got one
C	much nicer
A	mm
B	at the bottom of hers
C	yeah and it
B	yeah
C	Cos you had a second room with like a bedroom bathroom
B	oh right
C	yeah
B	wow
C	it was really nice
B	yeah
C	the guy who owns the house
A	you could I mean that would I dunno be a couple of thousand pounds worth of timber to
B	I mean if you didn't want to move it's er it's there's plenty of room
B	losing anything off the garden
A	just build your own house
B	well
B	I'm
A	yeah
B	I mean a lot of men like a kind of project like that
A	mm
B	so
B	well that's no but it'd look nice
A	but wood would be nice
C	Wood would be really nice
B	well it would but you'd have to treat it and keep it
A	not really
B	you know
A	mm
B	well you do
A	no well you buy a treated timber
B	mm
C	Wood with those doors that slide
A	oo
C	along
B	mm
C	so the whole of the front would open
B	I that would be very nice
A	yeah
B	mm
C	solar panels
B	yeah
B	yeah
C	Cos that would run that and probably your house
B	and then
C	and they you could sell it back to the grid
B	er actually yeah
C	power from here
B	it would actually be going that way
C	yeah
B	Cos I've got nowhere to put
A	mm
B	solar panels on this
A	no
B	so it would be quite good
C	so all of the roof could be solar panelling
B	absolutely
C	you could put it and obviously that's the end that gets the most sun
A	are they
B	it does
A	do they still doing grants for it
B	the government have just cut them all back
C	of course
A	mm
C	but you can get
B	but I'm not gonna it's not gonna happen like in the next
B	so
A	no I was thinking of buying some tobacco and a lottery ticket
B	oh
A	so you never know
C	and a few thousand pounds worth of timber anyway
A	well that was after the lottery ticket
A	mm
C	nice
A	hm
B	I mean the odds are obviously ridiculous
A	somebody wins
B	somebody's got to win it
A	yeah
B	and somebody does
A	well it's the odds are bumping into a complete stranger and guessing their phone number
C	really?
C	Good
A	you know
B	oh right
B	really? There are more numbers in a phone number
A	well
B	oh
A	six figure number
B	okay
A	but then
A	it's kind of true isn't it
B	yeah
A	and the odds are exactly the the odds are that the same chance that it turn up one two three four five six
B	yeah
A	as any other numbers
B	yeah exactly
A	bizarre really
B	well of course
A	very few people get a lot of money
B	exactly
A	it does sort of make very few millionaires
B	oh darling
C	mm
A	oh don't get poorly
C	mm
B	I think it's probably time to go indoors
C	mm
A	have a lie down for an hour or so till till you have to drive off and pick up
C	I think if I go to sleep I won't will never get up again
A	well lie and watch something
A	have a little rest
C	what's the time?
A	it's five o'clock
B	mm
C	okay
B	we have
A	is she allowed to turn off the music and watch something?
B	we have a
A	mm
B	no
A	mm
B	in what we watch
B	um
A	pretty similar
B	agree with a lot of
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	mm
B	but it's quite tricky finding something for everyone to you know that we agree on
A	oh I did see the most bizarre film on this free channel
A	er Nicole Kidman
B	mm
A	who I think is quite astonishing actually
B	I like her in certain things
A	she's in this she's amazing
B	yeah
A	his name
B	when was it made?
A	Don't know
B	yeah
A	um
C	it's a bit like Benjamin Button I suppose is it?
A	A little bit
B	I haven't seen that
A	in that way
B	er I mean I I know the idea but
A	but and the kid is absolutely fantastic
C	so how old is he then? He what age is he playing
A	about fourteen or something like that
C	oh
A	no it's it it's kind of
C	did it look like it was quite old?
A	no
C	mm
A	I'd know that
B	how how long ago do you think it was made?
A	it's quite hard to tell
B	uh
A	within the last ten years maybe? I don't know
B	I mean I don't know a lot of her
A	is there a list of titles
B	yeah
C	it won't be anything recent I don't think
A	right
C	Cos it doesn't ring a bell with me
B	well she's been making films for a long time
A	I think it didn't er I think it possibly didn't do very well
B	how old did she look?
A	film channels
B	did she look?
B	okay
A	no er The Interpreter I've seen
B	yeah
A	ten-year-old boy
B	A reincarnation of her dead husband
A	yeah
B	how bizarre
A	yeah
C	who directed it?
A	oh
B	Jonathan Glazer
C	mm
B	I know the name but I dunno what else he's done
C	how peculiar
B	this is very odd
C	who's the fella? Her new husband
B	Cameron Bright
C	mm
B	dunno
C	is it from a play? Cos the name sounds familiar
B	no
A	it's very clever because um obviously everyone's like hysterical about it
B	two thousand and four
A	don't be so absolutely ridiculous
C	mm
A	the more freaky it gets
C	my God
A	and it it's kind of what in God's name is happening here? It's like he can't be right
B	that's weird
A	it's very very clever
B	when was this on then?
A	but it's all in her
B	mm
C	no I want to watch it
A	it's kind of
B	I've never even heard of it
A	no
C	sounds interesting
B	oh so er two thousand and four
A	two thousand and four?
B	yeah
A	okay
B	well
A	hm
B	doo doo doop
C	it's here
B	can you pass the old
C	stretch
B	can't reach
C	stretch
B	can't reach
C	stretch a bit more
B	things in the way
B	things in the way
C	stretch a bit more
B	no I can't
C	mm
B	mm
A	actually
B	they're in the garage
A	are they? There's loads
B	yeah
A	it's ridiculous
B	I know
A	er
B	it's good to do that
A	but I've lent a few out
B	oh and you don't know where? I know I
B	I always swear I'm never gonna lend people anything
A	because I thought I remember Performance as being a quirky film
B	mm
A	with Mick Jagger
B	it definitely is
A	and
C	mm
B	James Fox
A	but when I watched it again I thought bloody hell
A	it's very good
B	I haven't seen it for years
A	much more powerful than I thought it would be
B	yeah?
A	really good
B	I haven't seen it for years and years  and years
A	and I was talking to
B	mm
A	rubbish in their house
B	mm
A	I can't  I can't  even think what's in there
B	er you you bought quite a few when you were in Saudi
A	oh yeah
B	needed to watch something
A	yeah
B	mm
A	I wonder what I've got there
B	oh right
A	that's pretty powerful
B	yeah
A	it's not very
B	no it's not
A	it's not jolly watching
B	no
A	um
B	mm
A	just in a room
B	huh
A	have you seen it?
B	it's brilliant
A	and he's he's er
B	yes
A	it's amazing
B	it's absolutely amazing
A	and they're just locked in this room together
B	yes
A	and it's just dialogue
B	oh it is so good
A	oh well I've got that
B	and I saw it there and I thought oh that's weird
A	I've got that in the shed
B	oh er
C	sounds good though
B	God knows what it's called
C	I'd love to watch it
B	it is really good
A	there's some
C	really?
B	absolutely brilliant
A	Cos he's talking about alcohol
C	mm
B	yeah
A	he says you know my friend he just stepped out one day you know because of alcohol stepped out one day in front of a car
C	oh
A	and it's got this very fast
A	kind of snappy dialogue all the way through
B	he's not my favourite actor but he's made
A	oh they're both brilliant
B	a couple of films that are really good
A	I love both of them
B	uh
A	and the two of them together just like arguing in this room
B	but they're arguing about you know they're having a real existential debate
C	mm
B	the Sunset Limited
A	yeah
C	oh so the play is called two-hander?
B	no no no er I mean it's er sorry it's it's a play with two people
C	I've just never heard that expression
B	have you not?
C	no
B	oh okay
A	well
B	it's two people
A	just two people
B	oh it's written by Cormac McCarthy
C	oh
B	I should've realized
A	I had never heard of it
B	two men in an apartment with er opposing beliefs
A	yeah
B	it is er so well-written
A	shall I have a look in it before the light goes? In the
C	yay
A	plough through
B	do you wanna have a look? Er yeah we could do that
A	well no I don't mind
B	well it'd be quite nice to see actually no cos we'd have to lock everywhere up so
B	I hope to God there hasn't been any leaks
A	well
B	I do remember though that things were piled
A	I can have an idea about tomorrow
B	oh okay
A	um
B	Good luck
A	hm
C	I don't think anyone's been in the garage since then have they?
B	well it'd be quite nice cos cos we all
A	oh well never mind
C	you wouldn't be able to get in the garage
B	no
A	mm
B	because you we piled it up
A	yeah
C	oh that's true
B	so neatly
C	yeah
B	um
A	alright
B	yeah
A	well I'll go and have a look in a minute
B	yeah

B	it would
A	it will
C	to have a reason to you know to to structure his day
B	exactly
A	no he
C	mm
B	yeah
A	you know
C	well it's independence as well
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	he and dad spend a lot of time together which is great cos they get on so well
A	yeah
C	but
B	but it's nice to have other things
C	be good to have a break
A	but then
B	exactly
A	but then he won't be reliant on his dad for money and you know
C	absolutely
B	I mean it's only a basic wage but still it's
A	well it's a bit of pocket money for him
B	exactly
C	it's money that he's earned isn't it
A	he hasn't got overheads
B	no
A	hasn't gotta earn his rent or
B	no
A	you know
B	yeah
A	which would be for whatever
B	mm
A	that'll be a test won't it

C	the more he does the more active he is the more
B	and that's
C	he will stay away from the drugs
B	well I think that's true
A	well that's it
