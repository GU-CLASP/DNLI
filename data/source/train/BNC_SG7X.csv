B	yes with me
C	and the they were
B	your mother and father years ago
C	oh my mother did go
B	yes
C	oh yes
B	but anyway erm if you want to we could with
C	well that sounds a good idea
A	yes that'd be nice wouldn't it? yes
C	yes yes
B	and it's at one of those gastro pubs
C	right
A	oh is it? oh that's nice
A	oh that's a nice idea yes
B	yeah so if I get the voucher then you
A	oh okay was it easy?
B	it
C	oh yeah
A	yes
B	and then dad and I both trawled through looking at all the different ideas for days out and this is a good one we thought
A	yes
C	hasn't
A	I don't know
C	does someone have some friends there?
B	well that girl off the cruise her parents lived at
C	oh
B	yeah
C	perhaps that's where I got it from yeah
B	yes but sadly her mother died she erm she was on that
C	didn't die on ship?
B	no no
A	yes it's always a bit mysterious when they get extra cabins halfway through the cruise
C	yes yes yeah that's right yeah that's right yeah
B	it was a
A	how's that possible?
B	it was a bit of a shock to
C	well we had one actually
B	oh yes
C	and what happened? yeah someone collapsed
B	oh yes
C	we suddenly turned back and then
B	oh right oh yes
C	took her away
A	oh right yes
B	yes
C	yes yeah
A	well you've said it's happened to you on the cruises
B	yes yes it has we've been taken off and
C	yeah oh dear
C	you know
C	yeah
A	well good if you want a sea burial
C	well a sea burial yeah
A	easy to arrange isn't it?
C	well they used to that's what they used to do years ago hadn't they?
A	that's right yes
B	anyway on a
C	quite famous people were buried at sea I suppose and
B	yeah that's right very famous people
C	yeah
B	but it's not going to be us dad is it?
C	yeah that's right
B	cos I've just finished booking the
C	oh yes?
B	booked the hotel on the way down the Holiday Inn and then I booked the parking
C	is that the one at Southampton?
B	yeah er no another one
C	another one yes
B	yes
C	I know we stayed down there somewhere the Holiday Inns yes
A	mm
B	cos you were I took you there last time to
C	oh is that the
C	just over on there yes?
B	er this is a different one on sort of a bit just out of Southampton
C	sounds rather nice if
B	I know it's good isn't it?
C	yes nice
B	I've done the parking and they've covered you for insurance but that was an interesting story
A	yeah it'll be lovely
B	cos I rang up to get it and then you have to decide on the two grades so I thought well I'll get you platinum which was the best colour I had last time so it was quite a big bill I mean it was like three hundred and twenty-eight pounds
C	goodness me
A	cor
B	but that's what we paid
C	yes
B	but anyway when the blurb came through I thought well I better read this and I saw something on there that wasn't right that you were
C	oh that's good that's
A	cor that's good
A	yes
C	oh well
B	so I was very pleased with myself that I read it all properly
A	dear you probably got fiddled the last few years
C	yes
B	no because I'd read it all before
A	ah right
B	but if this was you just have to go through it all again and over the phone they ask for all these questions
C	how did
B	if you're of a certain age you have to do it on the phone but
A	oh right
B	under a certain age you can just fill in the form online
A	yeah
C	how do they get? why put you there in the first place then like?
B	she must've misheard me over the phone but she got that detail wrong
C	oh I see yes
B	they they have to ask you what your medical conditions are then I know you haven't got very many but you have to declare what you have got
C	you should stay on the phone I'll go and ask my doctor
B	but I did ask her the first time
C	oh yeah
B	and and he was very good because
C	yes
B	he wanted me to ask him specific questions otherwise it would've been very expensive like we'd've had to pay him
C	oh right
B	to tell us
A	oh right
C	yeah
A	mm
A	dear
C	yes
B	yeah so and I've got it all down and I you haven't told them you've got anything else
C	yeah good
B	he's got millions of pounds cover
A	oh it's good
A	should get a make sure you get your laptop stolen the Ipad stolen all of those things and you can have a new one
C	that's right
B	yes
C	I was reading about er what's-the-name Cameron
A	oh I know I just saw that
C	yes
A	yes cos he's lied as well now hasn't he?
C	apparently
B	oh has he?
A	yes he's he's got caught
C	yes
A	cos initially he said
B	ah
A	oh I don't have anything to do with that
B	and
A	and now it
C	yes no
B	oh no it's
A	so people were fine about that and then he said I don't have any shares in that company which is true because he sold them but he didn't tell them that
C	yeah
A	and now it's turned out he's profited from the arrangement after his father died so he was responsible for that
A	whether it was illegal I suppose is the next question
C	oh yes
B	well cos a lot of these things are not illegal are they?
C	yes
A	no
C	yes
B	but it's a grey area isn't it?
A	but then considering he's the one saying he wants to close down all these loop holes
C	well that's right isn't it?
A	that's what's outrageous about it cos he's the one benefiting
B	yeah it's quite disappointing isn't it all this?
C	yes I mean the prime minister you expect him to know a few things don't you?
A	that's right cos he's the one saying we need to shut down all these
C	yes yes absolutely yes right
A	you know they may be legal but it's not ethical and then he's got caught in the same thing
B	yeah
A	he could have to resign over that actually if it gets big enough
C	yes
B	yes
A	because erm he's the one championing it he'll look silly won't he if he's saying
B	yes
A	one thing to one person then it turns out he's?
C	yes
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A thinks it is legal but not ethical	Entailment
B	it's it's just sad isn't it really? cos it happens all the time
A	well
C	yeah
A	he was quite unethical
B	mm
A	yes
C	course the papers get after them on these things don't they?
A	yes
A	he should've come clean in the first place because once he knew they had the documents
[ANNOTATION]	For both speakers he was not ethical at all	Entailment
A	it was just a matter of time before
C	someone goes after it
A	his name came up with it and he they already has his father's from day one
C	yeah yeah
A	so they knew yes
C	yes
[ANNOTATION]	They know that the prime minister is a controversial politician	Neutral
A	well good they've been caught some of these people
B	yes
B	mm
C	cos his father was quite prosperous wasn't he apparently?
A	yes that's right
B	and then all the money the government's spending on letting us know about the advantages of being in the EU
C	yes
A	oh yes
[ANNOTATION]	His father was not that wealthy	Contradiction
A	what a waste of money
B	seven million pounds I think they've spent on that
C	golly that's a lot of money yes
A	just for a leaflet
B	but it's also one-sided because
B	people say most of us say we don't know enough about it but
C	no no
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker C believes that is a tremendous amount of money	Entailment
B	but we you've gotta have two sides of the argument
B	we've only got one
A	such a propaganda
A	no
B	no
C	no
A	no so it's really wrong and it's taxpayer's money
C	we just have yes
B	yes I think it's not good like that
A	no I don't think it's good
B	not both sides
A	yes
B	we need the both sides like
A	especially when they're cutting services all the time you think well give them that money give the police that money or the NHS or
B	yes yes
A	someone I don't think the NHS is very good at managing their budget either though
C	no no no no no no
A	the police
B	yes
A	yes
C	the NHS can always do with some money I suppose yes
A	yes but they've been wasting a lot it turns out
A	paying all sorts for agency nurses and private taxis
C	oh well
A	millions of pounds
C	oh oh dear yes
A	think you might want to have your own ambulance if you're paying that much a year?
A	no I haven't actually yes I must put that on my list
C	well it's a
B	tell
A	oh that's fun
C	yes that's right
B	and what they said to you on the way do you remember?
C	I've forgotten now er
B	well the person assisting you said right well you know we've got plenty of time here the blue light was going well let's stop at the pub have your last drink
C	oh I'd forgotten about that yes oh yes
C	yes
A	yes ambulance drivers are good actually they're they're quite funny
C	they are yes
A	cos they do a stressful job don't they? but they're very good
A	oh right
C	I thought there must be something wrong here
A	dear
C	pointing this at me
B	yes
C	well there we are no no
B	grandpa can remember waking up in the night he was quite poorly took a turn for the worse and there were all the doctors at the foot of the bed and you know
C	all discussing me
B	I think you know they thought perhaps grandpa was half out but discussing whether they should do anything or not sort of thing didn't they?
C	yes
A	dear you should've hello
A	I'm here
C	not not quite you what you want
A	yes
C	I've probably outlived all those doctors anyhow
A	yes
A	is that your voting card there grandpa?
C	oh yes
A	so are you going to vote? it's quite soon isn't it?
C	I normally do yes I normally go there yes
A	yes
A	oh is it? oh that's good
C	I think so does it tell me?
A	I don't know can have a look if you want
C	oh yes
A	oh that's good yeah that's quite nice to go
C	yes
A	yes that's soon isn't it?
C	oh the sixth of May yes
A	sixth of May yes I'm doing the election count this year
C	are you?
A	yes
B	oh that's good
C	oh
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	no it's paid a hundred pounds
B	oh is it? is it?
C	oh that's nice
A	no because they the poles close at nine thirty
B	yes
A	and they do the brief or no the poles close at ten don't they?
B	oh I see
A	ten PM but they do the briefing at nine thirty to start you go in for nine thirty
B	yes
A	and then you stay until the count's done which is usually around two AM or three AM
B	okay
A	but if they order a recount because it's gone wrong then you could be there all night
B	and do you get paid more for that?
A	no so it's a flat rate a hundred pounds
B	you don't?
C	no
A	but if you work it out actually it's a very good hourly rate because it's normally
B	well that's very good
A	yes if it's normally only well what's that? say ten eleven twelve one two so it's about four and a half hours is what they
B	oh yes
A	so that's twenty pounds an hour
C	yes oh
B	yeah it's pretty good
A	which is well above the minimum wage
B	better than the university pay
C	yeah it's not bad
A	yes it is actually
B	and all you've gotta do is count
A	that's right and they've asked me if I can do the referendum
B	oh really?
A	cos that's a big thing isn't it?
B	oh yeah that's good
A	so this can be my practise one
B	it's useful all these extra things you're finding you can do for a bit of money
C	yes
A	yeah it's quite fun yes
C	so they have a register and they check you on that don't they these?
A	yes
C	I thought here they used to have a register somewhere
A	yeah so I'm not doing that part
C	oh I see
A	I'm doing the bit when the polls close and then we have to open all the ballot papers and put them in the right pile
C	oh yes I know
A	so erm I know who I want to win so I'll make sure there's two extra
C	yeah and if you don't like anyone it goes in that one yes
C	mm oh no
A	you know no marks on the back of the paper
A	yes
C	he seems to be in trouble all the time
A	oh yes he is isn't he? well hopefully he won't get in
C	oh no won't get in
A	yes so that's nice fifth of
C	I'll post my poll card
A	fifth of May are you going to vote mum?
B	yes I
A	mm
C	yeah
A	do you usually?
B	I do
A	that's good
C	I nearly always I think I always go and vote
A	yes you should
C	I'm not sure your mum ever did she didn't bother voting
B	no cos about half the people don't vote do they?
C	no no
A	no
C	yes okay yeah
A	I wonder if more people turn out for the referendum
B	suppose they might
A	only if they know what to do at the moment
B	mm no no that's it
A	yeah
C	this is to do with
A	ah that's just to tell you you're registered
C	oh I see
A	I don't think you have to take that along
C	oh of course
A	but it's just to let them you know where it is
C	election for police crime commissioner they you are
A	yes yes that's quite a big one
C	oh
B	now I think we should make a move so we're not we don't rush in case there's traffic
C	okay
A	yeah
B	it should be coming out of
A	right
B	we ought to go
A	yes see what you mean
B	mm
A	yes I'm ready
B	course my car's in water but I had a bit of a problem with it I mean quite minor really it's just the seat belt got jammed
A	oh dear
C	oh
B	so anyway he ordered it and then just yesterday evening I was going out and the lady sorry in the garage told me a good way to stop the beep beep beep going all the time was to put the seat belt from the other side
C	oh yes
B	into the the slot on my side
C	yours yeah
B	so that sort of worked but er course I didn't know whether to drive into
C	yeah
A	yes
B	and I was going to tennis last night I thought I'll try this again so gently pulled it like I'd been trying to before and it came so I phoned the garage and hopefully we might get a refund for the belt that just arrived
A	oh right
C	oh
B	but he's holding onto it for a week in case it goes bad again
A	yes cor that's funny isn't it?
B	it is quite funny
C	yeah
A	mm
B	so when they they have to they can't repair it if your belt gets jammed cos it's a sealed unit it's ridiculous
C	yeah yeah
A	yes
B	a brand new one
A	that's what the man in the garage was telling me these new cars you always have to replace the whole thing with everything so it gets really expensive
B	yes I know it's so annoying yes cos all it needs is someone to take something off to look to see why the thing's jammed
A	yes no it's really annoying he said yes
B	mm
C	oh is it cheaper keeping an old car now then is it?
A	well he likes your car my mechanic because he says it it's not all computerised like these modern ones so he can fix things if he needs to
C	oh oh oh lovely
A	whereas the new ones he can't do anything
C	no you're stuck with it
A	so you have to send them off to the
A	yes well they're basically useless once they go
C	oh oh dear don't want that
A	you know your sort's more mechanical so then
C	yeah
A	they can actually go in and say oh well that's broken
C	oh yes
A	let's take that out and put a new one
C	well that sounds a much more sensible way
A	seems sensible
C	yeah
A	I suppose the car companies must be thinking though they'll make more money like this won't they?
C	oh yeah probably
A	yes if you have to keep replacing your car every few years because the computer's gone wrong yes
C	well have to tell you that with the KA you know
A	yes
C	oh yes I don't know no
A	no I'm sure it'll be fine you don't drive it much anyway do you?
A	no I'm sure it'll be fine your one should be
A	Golf
C	couple of thousand
A	oh yes no it should be fine
C	yeah
A	right I'm ready for off
C	there we go
A	just put that there goes like that
B	I had to get some things at Argos dad
C	oh have you?
C	oh
B	you well no you've got to have some
B	we got it in
C	yes yes oh
B	the same day
C	you've gotta well you've gotta go to
B	yes I'm coming
C	yes
C	yeah
