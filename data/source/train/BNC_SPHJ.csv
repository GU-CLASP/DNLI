A	here we are hello
B	there's oh er
A	no I'm talking to you well
B	you know I like how we're going to all of these places cos in the hope that one day someone will visit me
A	I know and you know where to bring them
B	she says laughing hysterically
A	I took my Krakow friend
A	who's vegetarian to
B	yay
A	cos I knew they'd have a choice of two things
B	you can have salad or
A	yeah
B	what's the pasta?
A	erm it's just sort of pasta in a creamy sauce
B	uhu
A	so it's not vegan it's quite creamy
B	uhu
A	erm
B	yep
A	and then there's something else
B	the gnocchi
A	oh yes spinach gnocchi which is nice but you need twice as much as they give you
B	yeah that's rather cruel rather cruel
A	mm
B	the ambassador's soup
B	what does it mean?
A	oh ambassador with this soup you are really spoiling us
B	there's a lot of meat going on
A	there is a lot meat
B	beef
A	oh oh my
B	vegetarian barbecue
A	oh my god two four six eight nine options
B	well one of er can I just point out that one of the options
A	oh my god
B	on the vegetarian dishes is omelette ham or mushroom
A	oh okay
A	goodness me
B	and ravioli with meat
A	oh okay
B	so it's not entirely vegetarian
B	erm
A	erm just coffee to start yeah?
B	yes please er
B	yeah
A	I take that back
B	it's a slight lie
A	I got really excited about nine vegetarian options but it turns out many of them just aren't erm okay
B	but
B	and there as there are
A	it shows willing
B	furthermore er vegetables and salads
A	yeah
B	yeah
B	croquettes? potato
A	so I could have potato with cabbage
B	well I don't know potato croquettes are
A	sounds quite nice
B	croquettes are potato if but if it says croquettes with cabbage it might just be
A	it does
B	I don't know what that means
B	maybe it's what did you have with cabbage the other day? the
A	oh that was lovely that was kind of rice in
B	yeah I know
A	cabbage leaves
B	in cabbage I don't think it'll be that
A	with a tomato sauce no I don't think it will
B	I don't think it'll be that no
A	yeah
B	uhu
A	but sides are only like eighty P each which is quite good
B	mm mm mm
A	so a side of chips hundred grams of chips eighty P
B	a hundred grams
A	I know that's seems quite precise but
A	indeed
A	kind of thinking if they do pancakes I love a spinach
B	yeah didn't see them but I wasn't looking
A	with garlic sauce but yeah
B	gizzards
A	what's a gizzard?
B	it's like the inside of a chicken
A	eh lovely
B	it's the insides of something Japanese-style herring
A	no I haven't seen pancakes I wonder what vegetarian barbecue
B	why?
A	yeah
B	alarm you?
A	yeah
B	vegetables
A	skewers that have been grilled or something but
B	I don't know I don't know
A	so poultry
B	nice
A	mm
B	I don't know whether I'm gonna get any something maybe sweet I know that I've just said I'm living this sort of holy oh freshly squeezed
A	what?
B	do you know how
A	yeah
B	why?
A	no that's true it's like two quid
B	it's probably paying off an expensive blender or something
A	it's probably paying for the person that then has to spend three and a half hours
B	picking bits of carrots out
B	very expensive
A	so it is very expensive but I think I'm
B	uhu
A	do you want cake? or what are
B	it's expensive
A	do you want something sweet?
B	don't know
A	mm
B	get a salad
A	I don't eat a lot of cold stuff at home
B	yeah
A	and I think it's good sometimes just to get raw stuff
B	yeah I've not eaten anything cold or raw
A	yeah
B	for ages
A	it's not really the season for it but I feel quite warm at the moment so
B	yeah
A	it doesn't hurt to have something
A	yeah
B	yeah I am another new experience
A	and I
B	yeah and ask about these vegetarian options
A	and ask about I mean yeah cos a lot of them just plainly aren't oh look at the back they do erm these cute little ice creams
A	yeah
A	actually I know hotel
B	this
A	it's just a little gingerbread
A	gingerbread looks nice
B	and ice cream and
A	cor you'd fart a lot after that blimey
B	I know it's so expensive as well
A	yeah what would you pay in a Wetherspoons?
B	I don't know
A	two pound ninety-five?
B	yeah
A	how much does it cost here?
B	about two pound ninety-five
A	so
B	well I think that's quite expensive
A	for here
B	yeah
A	but do you want it?
B	no not really
A	oh well don't get it then
B	I just want like one chocolate
B	do you know what I mean? you can't
A	maybe you should've got a hot chocolate
B	no
A	mm
B	not sure what I want
A	yeah
A	mm
B	exhausted
A	why? cos you've been exercising lots?
B	exercising lots yeah woke up
A	mm
B	considering I went to bed at half ten
A	wow lots of sleep
B	yeah
A	you must be needing it
B	I think cos I had so much fresh air yesterday maybe I'm just erm
A	mm
A	yeah
B	don't know but feel better for it
A	good that's the important thing
B	yeah
A	I think that goes in cycles as well I er think at the moment I'm having a phase of sleeping less
B	mm?
A	which is
B	mm
A	yeah but other times yeah I can sleep for ten hours straight and I might do that for a few days and then get over it
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	just building up the momentum to go back to work
A	but you're not there now
B	that's true
A	you could get run over by a bus in the morning then you'll've wasted all of this time worrying
B	mm panicking
A	so don't worry
A	mm ah
B	thank you
B	what are you having?
A	erm
A	that's so cute it's like a little cheese straw man
A	with a nappy on
B	I know I like how it's perfectly obvious that he's wearing underwear
A	yeah
B	can't have a naked man made out of biscuit
A	oh no yeah would you like mine? I don't really fancy that
B	are you sure?
A	yeah
B	oh thanks

A	so all yours
B	mm
A	mm
A	yeah I'll have a bit of a foot yeah
A	do you wanna take his thigh back?
B	yeah
A	that's it
B	just sort of shortbready
A	mm
B	mm
A	mm I mean nice enough but
B	mm
A	yeah
B	cheers
A	so that's a bit of a boring audio I'm just thinking so far
B	I know
A	looking at a menu
B	we've just looked at the menu
A	so let's be really entertaining
A	mm
A	I know
B	mm
A	and we hold very similar views in many regards so there's not a lot of conflict there's just quite a lot of yeah I know
B	yes and er
A	yeah I know
B	I think we are very similar and hold similar views and we're both quite open to sort of
A	mm
B	not necessarily agreeing with but accepting or listening to
A	yeah
B	other views
A	yeah
B	so there isn't a lot of
A	yeah
B	well we agree
A	I know yeah
B	good
A	I suppose I'm I'm thinking
A	about erm speaking lessons and the discussion elements of
B	mm
A	you know give your opinion
B	yeah
A	erm if you can find a teenager that has an opinion that is of course erm
B	mm
A	mm
B	whether they agree with it or not and come up for with reasons for
A	yeah
B	which I don't fundamentally agree with because I think you know you're learning English to express yourself
A	mm
B	not to express someone else's views
A	yeah
B	but through the medium of English
A	yeah
B	I don't know
A	yeah but it can be useful sometimes in a you know to have a role play and say okay you lot believe this and you lot believe this
B	mm
A	discuss in your groups you know why you er think this way and then
B	yeah
A	people off to have a discussion a debate an argument a disagreement a whatever but yeah
A	it was interesting being out with erm
B	yes no yeah
A	er yeah but no but yeah but no but
B	mm
A	her little box
B	mm
A	that the other one noticed
B	mm
A	and thought oh that's counter to my political beliefs erm so these two guys it was kind of interesting for me witnessing the conversation that went on between them erm with
B	mm
A	six months ago on Facebook and you've retained that information to talk to me about it now and then there was something that
B	mm
A	of them that they have very different political views and we ended up sort of having the group conversation about how because we're grown-ups we can still maintain a friendship with people
B	mm
A	who feel differently to how we feel and you know almost not throw the baby out with the bathwater
B	mm
A	because there are other aspects of our friendship erm or aspects of that
B	mm
A	person's personality that we do like and do engage with
B	mm
A	so I was almost having to sit
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	erm and steer the conversation away from immigration and
B	mm
A	bit of a debate erm before I stayed with her on my way to Poland in September
B	uhu
A	and she noted that
B	oh you know I was
A	because of her views
B	uhu so in terms of like unfriending people because of their views on Facebook
A	mm
B	it depends on my relationship with that person
A	yeah
B	if it was a very close person or close friend I would sort of
A	mm
B	whereas if it's someone that I worked with three years ago or went to school with
A	yeah
B	I'm just like fuck off
A	fuck off fair enough
B	but that's how you know you get this impression that
A	mm
B	and you can't believe that there's like a Conservative government
A	yeah
B	because it's like I don't know anyone
A	oh my family
B	but I don't
A	yeah
B	a lot of these people are my friends
A	yeah
B	how can this've happened? erm
A	yeah
B	I don't know if that's right or wrong er but I read an
A	that's right for you
B	interesting quote that said how it was something like how can you class er a foetus as a person
A	mm
B	but not a refugee child?
A	mm good question
B	yes how can you want one thing in your country but not another?
A	mm
B	a thing that is already an actual human being
A	that's a very valid question in Poland
B	mm
A	yeah
B	erm exactly that's what I mean
B	and er it said something like you need to you
A	mm mm
B	erm it was
B	and er when we sort of screamed in her face
A	we both nearly ripped their heads off
A	so funny
B	ah get away from me
A	yeah
B	apart from sort of running at them and pushing them over
A	I know
B	I don't know how we could have made it more clear
A	no
B	other than sort of me standing up and
A	I know I did wonder as well you know about going back a bit later with my little you know pro-choice
B	yeah
A	placard or something
A	just to I dunno offer people an alternative
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	it was interesting the police were there though which would tend to suggest that they do have
B	they might have some
A	yeah
B	opposition
A	yeah which is great I bloody hope so
B	yeah er but from
B	who are these people?
A	mm
B	mm
A	who she goes out to on the tram erm and teaches English to and this woman apparently is ultra ultra conservative
B	uhu
A	and also
B	yeah the rainbow picture
A	oh that's what it was yeah she put the rainbow picture on in support of the American Supreme Court
B	mm
A	erm saying yes gay marriage across the country or marriage for whoever wants it across the country and her student picked her up on that and started quizzing her on her own beliefs erm and
B	mm
A	and lose that income erm which may not've been a huge deal for her but she would rather have the money
B	mm
A	and just talk about more banal things
B	yeah
A	and save her political discussions
B	yeah
A	for friends and people she has a different sort of relationship with
B	I sort of erm I don't like this school rule of you can't talk about politics gender sex religion
A	mm
B	but at the same time
A	yeah
B	it's
A	yeah
B	oh sorry can't talk about that
A	yeah
B	sometimes I go er okay in order to
A	fair enough
B	I sort of bring it up like that
A	yeah
B	you are aware that I have signed this contract but we're having this conversation because you know
A	you are happy to
B	yeah because
A	yeah fair enough
B	I've said that it's okay
A	yeah
B	but I sort of rely on it sometimes and go right I'm not allowed to talk about it so you're not allowed to talk about it
A	so shut up you racist bastard
B	so shut up you
B	absolute arsehole
B	this is the person who I tried to get thrown out of the class and the school
A	yeah well I don't think you're gonna succeed there
B	er yeah
A	cos it seems the school is more about the money than about their teachers
B	the money than about sort of yeah
A	yeah
B	me not wanting someone who
A	although you'd think with their hugely high turnover of natives they might at least
B	yeah
A	do what they can to safeguard them
B	yeah
A	and try to keep them
B	so I think that's
A	yeah
B	you know it's a good and a bad thing
A	mm
B	and in the court I've said right there is this contract but because you know
A	mm
A	I've found the court was fine
B	you're grown-ups and you're very intelligent people and
A	mm
B	in a class there are extremes there are people who are going I am pro this I am pro that and people going what? how could you possibly say that?
B	anyway what? how can you possibly say that? you're a lawyer
A	yep yep
B	I'm not saying if you're a lawyer you're not entitled to your own opinions
A	yeah
B	but you're a lawyer you have to have an open mind
A	you have to be more balanced yeah
B	yeah erm
A	mm
B	it's an interesting er it's an interesting one and I I don't know do all workplaces have these kind of contracts where you shouldn't talk about X Y Z? er
A	in Northern Ireland yes
B	uhu
A	but you know they've only just stopped killing each other
B	yeah
A	fairly recently well for the most part
B	so I don't know
A	so yeah
B	at first I sort of really resented this rule but
A	mm
B	it's useful depending on the er group that you're with
A	yeah that's true and I think you know if you're making it clear to your students that you're not allowed to talk about it so if they want you to stop just say stop then
B	mm
A	you know I think that's fair enough I I had some great conversations with my judges erm and
B	yeah
A	and just like you I figure they're er grown-ups they're intelligent they've got their own views erm and it was helpful to me to be able to have speaking classes about issues that they felt passionate about so great
B	mm
A	so we did
B	yeah
A	god why do people breed?
A	Jesus shut up
B	it absolutely has to happen I'm afraid
A	that noise goes through me a crying cat or a kitten I is no problem
B	uhu
A	a crying baby just oh
B	I know
A	goes right through me
B	I know I know
A	mm
B	erm
A	mm
B	I don't like to push it too far
A	mm
B	erm and if I can stay in a sort of safer zone
A	mm
B	the most interesting conversation I had in the court actually was about giving money to homeless people
A	ah
B	erm it's er something like giving spare change to homeless people is a waste of money er
A	mm
B	attitudes towards er extreme poverty have I told you this before?
A	no you haven't how interesting tell me more
B	and you know there are people in who if you sort of live not in the countryside but if you live in a house sort of in the suburbs or er towards the countryside in one of these villages
A	mm
B	erm there will be a homeless person who comes and knocks on your door
A	ah
B	erm and you know er asking for food not asking for money
A	right
B	but actually asking for money er
A	mm
B	you know and there've been cases where you've prepared a sandwich and given it to them and then when you've taken the dog out for a walk the sandwich is you know in the bin erm
A	mm
B	but people who have given food to this person so at that time the next week they've come round because they think you'll be in so this you know one of my students said that it's been happening for like six months the same man comes at the same time and sometimes if they're going out they'll just leave a package on the doorstep
A	oh wow
B	and now they're getting to the stage where they're they just can't stop cos
A	mm
B	they don't know what the sort of repercussions will be are will there be repercussions if they stop?
A	oh so they're giving through fear rather than through love
B	yeah now yes
A	yeah
B	erm at the beginning I thought they
A	mm
B	and they feel like they can't stop cos they don't know what will happen if they do and I just thought and they were like well er
A	mm
B	and er they said what would happen in England? and I think and I just said well I think people would probably phone the police if someone come and
A	mm
B	and
A	yeah
B	er
A	happened regularly when I was little
B	invasion of privacy
A	mm
B	I suppose in some way
A	yeah I er I had traveller families
B	and I think people
A	come round
B	uhu
A	and it was usually in the summer erm asking for scrap metal
B	mm mm yeah
A	so my dad always kept a few bits in the shed erm
B	yeah
A	to give to them and
B	not like that but we had a man who used to come round and ask to sharpen the knives
A	yeah yeah
A	mm
B	I'd be like no
A	mm
B	no
A	yeah
B	you shan't er sharpen the knives
A	yeah we had those guys too yeah
B	yeah
A	scrap metal and knife sharpeners and in Northern Ireland even now erm in
B	uhu
A	erm but my mother-in-law will always keep a small bag of clothes by the door
B	right
A	so if she has traveller families knock on the door
B	mm
A	and say can you spare anything? she always gives clothes
B	uhu
A	erm
B	right
A	yeah
B	I've just never known it
A	mm
B	he was often
A	how often was he round?
B	er probably once or twice a year but
A	yeah
B	it was in summer
A	yeah
B	erm but no we had like no trick or treaters no Jehovah's Witnesses no one ever came to the door
A	wow
A	yeah
B	you'd have to really be arsed
B	erm and I don't know whether it'll be worse if you lived in a city centre but I suppose in a city centre there's lots of people A don't have a lot of money or live in apartments
A	mm
B	erm
A	yeah
B	I was I'm just thinking about in central
A	mm
B	and you wouldn't sort of erm you
A	yeah
B	rang the bell asking for food or money
A	yeah
B	er and other areas everyone's really poor
A	mm
B	erm so I don't know whether people would knock on the door anyway don't know
A	interesting yeah
B	but that sort of struck me as that's for me really weird
A	really weird yeah I haven't had any of that you know I live in the
B	mm
A	the sort of rural place that you're talking about I haven't had
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	anybody knock on the door like that but we do have a lot of guys who I think I'm pretty sure are homeless
B	mm
A	who er live around
B	oh
B	oh that looks
A	that looks great
B	er yeah
A	so oh very nice
B	mm oh
A	would you like some bread?
A	I think maybe you
B	you do know how to treat me
A	I do I know how to treat a girl and you can have a
A	you can dip it in my pesto if you like
B	oh
A	so oh
A	I am er
B	eat this carby food
A	yeah?
B	I was like why?
A	yeah why?
B	well he says I eat too many and I should
A	mm
B	so if I eat less carbs I won't be as strong
A	mm
B	so
A	I dunno I thought carbs erm turned to sugar
B	mm
A	and erm
B	mm
A	so they're less about strength more about energy whereas protein amino acid's more about building muscle strength
B	mm no energy well I suppose the energy to do the lifting
A	yeah
B	erm whereas my previous trainer was just like no you're
A	mm
B	and I was like
A	well I suppose there's carbs and there's carbs
B	yeah but he's
B	potatoes are shit and
A	oatcakes or oats are really good
B	yeah yeah
A	mm
B	so I think I'm gonna sort of cut back a little bit which is really depressing
A	do you wanna stick thing?
B	no
A	no neither do I do you want some bread and a dip? you're very welcome
A	it looks good
B	it does look good
A	I love homemade pesto it is the best
B	that looks really erm
A	I bet it's full of I bet it's full of garlic as well
B	what? so you can have salad huh?
A	so you have to have some so you don't pass out every time I breathe on you
B	what's what are you doing? oh
A	yeah
B	erm so yeah that was an interesting conversation that I had in the court
A	mm
B	and because I did it with every group that week everyone had their own stories
A	mm
B	about people knocking on doors or things that they'd heard
A	wow
B	and because it was coming up to Christmas and it's this tradition that for your Christmas meal you have to leave a space at the table
A	mm
B	in in case someone knocks on the door
A	oh my goodness
B	and I said well what happens if someone knocks on the door? and they go well no one ever knocks on the door I was like yeah but
A	they could
B	if a homeless person knocks on the door and says I'm hungry can I eat something? would you let them in?
A	and?
B	er
A	er
B	it made them really uncomfortable so I was like right
A	probably not
B	I'll take I'll take your silence as a no
A	yeah
B	er and they said a famous Polish actress sort of disguised herself and went and knocked on people's doors and said can I share your table?
A	mm
B	and only one family said yes
A	wow
B	she had to like knock on a whole street to get someone to say yes
A	and that was a woman you can imagine people being a little bit more wary of a man
B	uhu
A	erm but yeah being a woman goodness
B	yeah and
A	mm
B	erm
A	yeah
B	but they don't wanna look like a dick
A	yeah
B	and other people you know if you if you
A	yeah
B	so it's a er er an
A	it really is an interesting conversation
B	mm
A	who dressed himself erm to look like he was homeless and lay down on the steps of the church
B	uhu
A	to see if anybody stopped or talked to him or said hi how are you? or do you need anything? do you wanna come in? whatever and nobody did and so he then walked into the church they're all waiting for their new guy to appear and give the sermon so he walked in as the homeless guy sort of taking his homeless guy clothes off as he went
B	oh my goodness
A	erm went up to the pulpit and
B	bollocked them senseless yeah
A	yeah yeah
B	mm
A	and wanting to do what you can for that person like you would want somebody to do for you but
B	mm
A	at the same time there's so much in the media about fear et cetera or fear-based stuff erm that you can really understand why people are reluctant to they're maybe afraid of being attacked
B	mm
A	they're afraid of the person they've invited stealing from them hurting them hurting their children
B	mm mm
A	whatever so you can understand that as well with all of the hype
B	mm
A	that goes on in society
B	yeah
A	it's my pizza I'm eating leave me in peace and get out of my face and the whole purpose of the video is to try and make people feel guilty about saying no
B	mm
A	and then it was revealed that they were on camera but I think you know no fuck off
B	uhu
A	mm
B	you know and if the person next to you says yes then you go oh do I have to say yes because they said yes? or do I have to say no because they've already said yes so it's okay?
A	no
B	you know and I think it's you know it's about doing it for yourself and your own personal reasons and not comparing it to other
A	yeah
B	what the person on the next table is doing er
A	yeah
B	and then because that happens then you go have the food
A	yeah
B	and that was how they made food
A	that's not nice
B	yeah
A	mm
B	mm
A	presumably has driven human beings to
B	mm
A	perform an action they surely wouldn't perform
B	mm
A	if they had enough to eat
B	mm
A	that's sad
B	yeah it is sad er
A	mm
B	well that's what these kids did all day every day
A	yeah
B	and they must be sort of getting a lot I dunno
A	mm
A	like everything in life I intend an abundance for myself and food money clothes everything I need to survive but I intend an abundance and also intend that I might share that abundance with other people
B	mm
A	and that doesn't necessarily mean giving money to people who are living on the street or whatever erm that might mean you know buying a coffee for a friend once in a while
B	mm
A	or a meal or a whatever erm
B	mm
A	a fragment of all that is call it god if you want I don't like the word god because of its long elderly guy
B	mm mm mm
A	bearded sitting on a cloud patriarchal overtones but whatever you wanna call it this energy of all that is I look on that self as another self that person as another self and think right okay they're experiencing lack they've chosen that experience to learn
B	mm
A	and I'll give you some food and some money I like that a lot more
B	mm
A	there's such an energetic imbalance there for me and for that person and I don't quite know how to go about that if I'm going to give money I would much rather give it to a project
B	mm
A	that works with people to help
B	mm mm
A	empower people and I'm thinking about I you know I work with erm in
B	mm
A	and in return of course he got volunteer expenses he got his lunch he got tea coffee got friendship companionship he became a really good friend of mine for a number of years and we also had a homeless project
B	mm
A	because it then helps people to improve their life and living conditions
B	yeah sort of improves the sort of circle I suppose
A	yeah
B	uhu
A	mm
B	my erm student was telling me another student another judge erm
A	she said with her mouth full
B	er this other this judge
A	oh my god
B	they've got loads of money cos they're judges
A	yeah
B	er so you know she was like it's not really a problem but it was sort of the way he went about it that I thought was quite unusual
A	yeah
B	and you know erm
A	mm
B	really erm
A	oh
B	so when she got to the cashier she was like oh I've just forgotten some milk can you go and get me the milk? er er you know
A	yeah
B	but yeah that was er
A	yeah I would find that quite passive aggressive well
B	mm
A	more more aggressive than passive actually and I think I would say fuck off
B	mm
A	mm and be
B	and I'm more than happy to sort of buy sandwiches
A	yeah
B	here I've bought you a sandwich whatever erm
A	yeah
B	but if someone's said oh can I sort of come round the supermarket with you and you just sort of
A	no
B	buy me a basket of things? I'd be like
A	no
A	you know does it inspire love? or does it inspire fear?
B	uhu
A	and in that situation I might be afraid that if I say no they're going to hurt me in some way
B	yeah
A	and so that's really poor motivation for me to do anything
B	mm
A	acknowledges it's a bit like a Namaste it acknowledges the presence
B	mm
A	the existence of this human being that's in front of me and recognises and er and acknowledges the equality that exists between us
B	mm
A	erm
B	mm
A	now it might be that in their string of incarnations they've chosen this particular lifetime to experience lacked experience
B	uhu
A	suffering to experience whatever it might be in this lifetime they've chosen chosen to triumph over adversity
B	mm
A	so whatever it is that they wish for themselves I wish the highest and best for them and I kind of feel that
B	mm
A	someone's hunger? erm but you know I feel that on other levels that does the power of good for a lot of people
B	mm
A	mm
B	mm
A	it was just happening
B	happening without
A	yeah and that then I thought well
A	it's it's worthless money is just numbers money is energy and if there's no loving intention behind the energy then I need to stop doing that and approach it in a different way
B	mm
A	but
B	interesting question
A	mm
B	er yeah
A	do you want some more? help yourself if you like
B	no I'm fine thanks
A	mm
B	I'm fine I don't
A	you what?
B	I don't wanna do the work
A	mm
B	it's my least favourite class on Mondays the first one
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	get it out the way
B	and like the lessons are easy to knock out at sort of ten a penny but the class just make me feel really uncomfortable
A	mm
B	mm don't like them
A	is this your down the stairs in the basement class?
B	mm
A	I hated teaching down there
B	yeah I've asked to move but there's no rooms big enough
A	bad vibes man
B	remember that time
A	mm
B	er
A	yeah
B	er you know it's er it becomes less about age at some point or it you know I don't have the authority to sort of battle against twelve eighteen-year-olds I just don't have it
A	yeah
B	erm
A	sometimes yeah
B	mm
A	and the stronger people have been
B	mm
A	mm
B	as half as much as you'd like to and sometimes they're sat in like the worst combinations and to move them too much they'd start getting really pissy
A	yeah
B	erm
A	six
B	eight or
A	mm
A	yeah
B	is just awful
A	that was my least favourite class was in the room next door with the room shaped like a horseshoe and every student has their back to the wall and a desk in front of them
B	yeah
A	and you can't move them about you can't split up well you know I did in the end but you know you can't really split up the troublemakers or move them about
B	mm
A	to any extent like that and it makes a huge
B	you can't mingle
A	difference huge difference
B	and
A	yeah
B	er it's just like well you only need to do one every lesson
A	what?
B	one mingling exercise I'm like
A	in an hour and a half
B	I was like but where am I supposed to put them?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	come through and then push the desks back again
B	yeah
A	cos we all knew each other a little bit better but it was a little bit like invading the personal space of
B	yeah
A	people you don't know that well
B	so my mingling which I've worked out actually works okay it's not really mingling but it's sort of moving which is make them all stand up and put tuck their chairs in
A	mm
B	move their bags pair them up right and say with your new partner look at these pictures on the wall around the room and go sort of clockwise around the room so then
A	okay
B	they're not mingling with each other but they've got a new partner and they're moving around
A	and they're moving yeah
B	and they just do
A	I know
B	yeah
A	so
B	and it's
A	yeah
B	you know it livens
A	and they you know kids have probably been at school since seven or eight that morning
B	mm
A	and are dropping off by the time they see you
B	mm
A	so no harm to get them moving as well
B	yeah and they have the fucking heater on full blast
A	mm
B	the windows closed so I've just got like the windows open and they're like oh can we close the window? I'm like no
A	no
A	I have that in the room next door as well
B	yeah
A	I hated that room hated it
B	yeah
A	I got
B	mm
A	and actually that was my upper intermediates and I taught that lesson four times a week and the other three times were a joy in comparison
B	mm mm
A	so it wasn't necessarily my prep erm but yeah it's delivery and dealing with especially unresponsive students and I think the environment has a lot to do with that
B	mm
A	cos you know I had two other classes of er well two of my other three classes where it went down fine were also teenagers but this particular group of teenagers in this particular room it's the sort of class where you'd say you know tell me three great things about your week
B	mm
A	erm oh nothing great's happened okay tell me three great things about your favourite celebrity oh I haven't got a favourite celebrity oh fuck off
B	mm mm mm
A	it's like you just can't get anything out of them a cattle prod wouldn't do it
B	yeah
A	mm
B	and they just sort of you know smirk and sort of sit really awkwardly I'm like just say
A	oh
B	and
A	ah
B	I have to tell them what to say how to have a conversation
A	mm
B	it's they're so boring
A	like pulling teeth
B	yeah how can you be sort of sixteen seventeen and not be able to have a conversation?
A	mm
B	it's like but
A	but you have other teenagers who do have conversations so
B	yeah
A	mm
B	and it's one of
A	yeah
B	er
A	yeah
B	so you must change
B	yes
B	it's like if er you know
A	yeah
B	you can't er and sometimes I'm quite sort of cruel and I go you can't be like that in the exam this is an exam prep course
A	yep
B	sort it out
A	yeah
B	I don't get paid enough to deal with all of this shit
A	have a role play have an opinion doesn't have to be your opinion just have an opinion
B	doesn't have to be true just make it up
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	and then I sort of whack out right well you can say this this this this and this and they're like oh I didn't even think of that I'm like no cos you can't think
B	er
A	mm
B	it's weird
A	so
B	the holidays
B	oh god inspiring
A	yeah
B	I suppose like most sort of I think part of it is I just can't remember what I was like when I was fifteen sixteen
A	mm
B	seventeen
A	yeah
B	to these questions at the time?
A	mm
B	and I think am I asking too much of them? and I'm going no I'm only asking sort of to the level of the exam
A	mm
B	and to the level of things they may need to be able to talk about
A	yeah
B	erm they've gotta grow up they've gotta mature
A	yeah
B	they've got to be able to do all of these
A	yeah
B	erm
A	yeah
B	oh yeah yeah yeah
A	everybody has got to be able to answer that question er
B	mm
A	what it was about how it began what the middle was like how it ended you know?
B	mm
A	you can come up with something even if you don't want to have an opinion
B	mm mm
A	you can come up with facts about it erm
B	my favourite teacher is Mrs
A	yeah
B	what subject does she teach? you know what kind of
A	yeah don't know
B	she's nice
B	Jesus lord
B	yeah
A	oh well
B	but you know some of these with the advanced classes I really sort of push er
A	good
B	things that they have to talk about
A	good
B	but I sort of pitch it a little bit harder than the exam front erm some sometimes sometimes sometimes pitch it a bit harder than the exam so that er you know the speaking bit should be a little bit easier I suppose
A	should be easier yeah
B	no not really
A	which one was it that consistently scored lower than?
B	er use of English and writing
A	writing mm
B	they score low on writing because they get scored they score so highly
A	mm
B	puts as the mark
A	fair enough mm
B	I don't know I don't wanna be seen
A	yeah
B	like seen as too critical
A	from my viewpoint which I can be completely honest about now I'm not employed by a school I set very few writing tasks because I didn't get paid for marking them
B	mm
A	yeah
B	I've got however many exam students
A	mm
B	forty
A	jeez yeah
B	that's forty pieces of writing like a week
A	yeah just trying to remember what I had
B	you should be about the same like four
A	I had
B	four FCE and a proficiency
B	mm
A	yeah
B	horrible
A	and there was one time I did all of my FCEs I set a writing task and I think I thought at that point never again
B	mm
A	or whatever I can get away with I think they were writing
B	mm
A	an email to er apply for a job as a lifeguard or something like that
B	mm
A	and that took time you know it took time first of all correcting the errors and then working out the common patterns of mistakes
B	mm
B	mm
A	I could do it quite quickly and do a piss-poor job but
B	mm
A	I didn't want to do that
B	I know sometimes I wonder how sort of useful my feedback is but then er at the same time I remember getting pieces of work back in school and just sort of shoving it in my bag looking at the mark shoving it in my bag not really looking at the feedback
A	mm
B	so I sort of think a lot of them are like that as well not all of them but some of them
A	mm
B	and I know the ones who aren't gonna give a shit what it says
A	yeah
B	erm but for some of them I write like a whole page of feedback you know
A	yeah cos you know they'll act on it
B	yeah sometimes I write more than they do
B	er
A	yeah
B	and one of them was like er you know it's not very helpful to see that much ink on my on my piece of work I was like well write better then
A	improve
A	do better next time
B	yeah
A	mm
B	when I have to say when I have to write erm if I set a piece of writing please do not er write out what you have read on the internet full stop
A	yeah
A	Jesus
B	review from the internet
A	something from the internet
B	yeah
B	and I just like typed in the sentence into Google and found what he'd copied it from
B	I was gonna print that off and
B	with sort of highlighted with what he'd copied
[ANNOTATION]	B is annoyed	Entailment
B	but then I thought that's a little you know
B	yeah I just didn't put a mark on it
B	it's like I'm not stupid
A	funny
B	can't trick a trickster my love
A	mm
B	can't trick a trickster
A	that's very polite
B	mm
A	mm
B	so
A	so
B	yeah
A	mm

A	mm
B	outside of the classroom sort of doing
A	hanging out
B	yeah just hanging out
B	that's not what I mean
[ANNOTATION]	B is proud of being a trickster	Entailment
A	yeah
B	he thought
A	oh
B	yeah and he thought
A	mm he is
B	er
A	in some ways
B	uhu
A	erm and he seems quite happy that at the end of a lesson I just give him his feedback sheet we go through error correction new vocab pronunciation and he seems really happy with that
B	good
A	mm
B	yeah er I'm gonna start doing more thorough
A	yeah
B	yeah I wanna be more like
B	become
A	she's just model teacher isn't she?
B	don't know how she does it
A	she's amazing
B	don't know how she does it
A	I think you meet people in life I used to be one of them who
B	mm
A	and be the very best I possibly can erm and sacrifice all other else all everything else to this end
B	yep
A	and I used to be like that I'm not like that at all anymore
B	mm
A	in a world that was still
B	mm
A	erm
B	mm mm
A	mm
B	she didn't study sort of English she studied how to teach English as a foreign language
A	yeah
B	and she's got a CELTA
A	yeah
B	so she's been sort of in the environment of teaching English since she went to uni when she was nineteen
A	mm
B	erm so that's a decade er cos it's in English but
A	yeah
B	erm it's not it doesn't being English doesn't give you the skills to be a teacher
A	yeah
B	mm mm mm
A	she lives it eats it breathes it
B	yeah
A	mm
B	erm but she's you know it's the experience that makes you better and she's got
A	mm
B	over double the
A	yeah
B	she'd graduated when she was twenty-five and she's like what? twenty-nine then
A	possibly not
B	but if I am I'll be as good as
B	or better
A	mm
B	so yep
A	I did enjoy that that was very nice
B	good
A	every time I eat out and the veggie option is salad and I have salad I think I must do more salads at home
B	do you not feel like it's a lot of faff?
A	no I don't mind the faff I don't mind preparing it at all but I just don't fancy all that cold when I'm at home
B	mm
A	I think cos I'm generally you know er being at home of an evening is sort of like cosy time sitting on the sofa with a blanket you know?
B	uhu uhu uhu
A	yeah
B	that you've got to sort of have a lot of salad
A	yeah and then

B	and onions and carrots
A	but I love that things go off so fast
B	yeah
A	it just makes you realise how much shit they put in it in the UK
B	yeah
A	I realised that when I think I told you about that my mum was in hospice and I'd gotten her a load of food in I think even then after then after she had died you know there were tomatoes in the fridge that were two months old and looked perfect
