A	when I went in there on Friday it was
B	oh
A	with like pens and notepads and that
B	were you there at four thirty-one?
A	I was there at four thirty-one
B	that's what you get you see
A	I just dragged
B	I think that's how you have to er you know
A	mm
B	proposition these things
A	that's true
B	just give them no choice
A	yeah
B	it's beer o'clock
A	we literally had the
A	and I was like do you want to come and get a drink?
B	nice
A	no probs
B	it did get to three thirty and I had to
A	oh the interviews were so long
B	huh
A	so drawn out
B	time they take up
A	and so then
B	mm
B	yeah
A	and I was like oh do I have to?
A	er no they don't know
B	oh
A	money for
B	yeah
A	so
B	nice
A	no they don't find out until July
B	mm
A	but during this point er where's she going? Er like
B	everyone's going to Mongolia at the moment
A	are they?
B	yeah

B	some editor that I was talking to recently
A	oh yeah
B	with the yep
A	oh
B	huh
A	it's not Mongolia
B	Montenegro?
A	it's not Montenegro
B	Monaco?
A	hot
B	Samoa?
A	hm
B	Mozambique?
A	mm
B	mm
A	I think it is Mozambique
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	tut
A	so because her boyfriend um is butterfly man
B	er er obviously
A	yeah
B	as in he's half-butterfly?
A	I think he might be
B	tut
A	um
B	licks?
A	probably both
B	tut
A	yeah
B	mm
A	few of his like people he works with
B	oh right
A	but
B	nice
A	onto this trip
B	so er is she just gonna have to take holiday from work?
A	yeah
B	so how
A	it's like a month I think
B	yeah
A	exactly
B	oh
A	imagine
B	although you do get to go to Mozambique
A	I think I know yeah
B	I think it it'd be such a culture shock
A	yeah
B	perfect then in that case
A	or anything
B	yeah
A	she's not really that sort of er person
B	I don't think she  I don't think she  needs to worry about that
A	maybe I should invite
B	yeah
A	do you think?
B	yeah
A	I know
A	and he'll be like
B	that's gonna make tomorrow er very difficult
A	yes
B	is there a chance that you could work from home tomorrow?
A	no
B	from home I mean
A	no chance
B	pass out
A	unless I rang in sick
A	no
B	Don't listen tape
B	there's a lot of stuff that I wonder
A	I know
B	what has been recorded
A	well cos you forget after a while don't you like
B	you do forget
A	for er for the first like five minutes you remember but then after that you're just like anyway guess what?
A	but yeah
B	it's good
A	well
B	um
A	right
B	A Dutch barge
A	uh-huh
B	and I'm gonna buy it in Holland
A	right
B	I've thought it all out
A	so that's a bit of a  bit of a  commute
B	no no no
A	excellent
A	uh-huh
B	I can't swim
A	right
B	and I can't sail
A	and both
A	canal boats aren't really fit for the sea
B	um they
[ANNOTATION]	boats designed for the canal handle sea water well	Contradiction
A	really?
B	my uncle's the one who put the idea in my brain
A	really? You can
B	I was gonna buy a barge
A	right
B	it's all very doable
A	uh-huh
B	runs a company that takes on kids that have been expelled from school
A	so you're gonna get some chavs
B	and he sails
A	to sail your
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b has an uncle	Entailment
B	the chavs are not coming on the barge
B	he runs excursions
A	uh-huh
B	to scare them into behaving
A	right
B	it er sounds quite
A	it's gonna work
B	well he's got er he's got a boat himself that he takes them out on
A	oh right
B	and there's no time to play the big I am
A	yeah
B	which I think is what a lot of the er
A	yeah yeah
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b has a license to drive boats	Neutral
B	you know teenage boys are all about
A	yeah
B	you can't really do that
A	have you broached this barge across the Channel idea with him?
B	yep
A	are you being serious?
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b wants to cross the Channel with a barge	Entailment
B	yeah
A	er
B	deadly serious
A	right
B	and here they're twenty
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a wants to join	Neutral
A	okay
B	so I buy one for myself
A	uh-huh
B	that's mine
A	right
B	and then the next one can be mine
A	okay
B	I mean er the barges that I did see when I researched
A	mm
B	this weren't two grand
A	right
B	they were twenty-seven euro twenty-seven thousand euro
A	right
B	so what I need to find out er from my uncle is whether this is realistic
A	can you really sail a barge across the English Channel?
B	I think you have to find out stuff like shipping lanes et cetera
A	P and O
B	ferry
A	no
A	but I mean like is it not too wavy? Hm?
B	no I don't think so
A	mm
B	is it wavy? It's only the Channel
A	it's quite wavy
B	well if you think like as we know my geography's really good
B	so if you
A	oh
B	if you think that this is the bottom of the UK
A	right
B	this is Dover
A	er
B	yeah
A	oh okay then
B	so that's Dover
A	uh-huh
B	here's Europe
A	uh-huh
B	and then Holland is like here isn't it?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	not too bad
B	success
A	yeah but
B	so it's in the straight isn't it
A	I think it is all
B	is my theory
A	kind of open sea
B	yeah
A	it's not just like er does not it's not just like you know a small lake you know
B	you have to sail it into the rivers
A	right
B	so you'd have to like maybe you'd come in on the Norfolk Broads
A	okay
B	in so up the Channel into the North Sea
A	right
A	do send us a postcard
A	from hospital
B	isn't there
A	I think it might
A	I think you've just
[ANNOTATION]	norfolk broads is in the south sea	Contradiction
A	written a new one
B	uh
A	well it's an interesting idea
B	tut
A	uh-huh
[ANNOTATION]	sending a postcard is an intersting idea	Entailment
B	because also there's the plan to run away
A	yeah
B	which is always a viable plan
A	so hang on
B	yeah
A	right
B	because what I'd quite like to do is do that and then if I do move away I've got something stable
A	you can just take it with you
B	like A I could take it with
B	probably not
A	yeah
B	Atlantic
[ANNOTATION]	norfolk broads is down the channel	Contradiction
A	get the barge involved
B	how I mean how many miles do you think that is?
A	Don't know
B	it's not like the Pacific
A	mm
B	yeah
A	no
B	maybe around Africa?
A	somali pirates?
B	oh yeah
[ANNOTATION]	there are pirates in Somalia	Entailment
A	yeah
B	that'd be quite nice
A	do you not have to er get them shipped on a bigger ship? Does the barge not have to go inside a bigger ship?
B	um
A	could you not just pay for someone else to get it over here? As in not like undertake this crazy let's go left at the
A	at the Channel
A	get to Dover
A	and then we'll be at the Norfolk Broads
[ANNOTATION]	the barge is the biggest ship	Contradiction
B	um
A	for you
A	yeah? Well it's always good to be confident
B	tut
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	it is bad to be confident	Contradiction
B	tut
A	yeah
B	I mean um I need to capitalize on
A	why don't you like delegate it to him?
B	tut
A	right
B	and er
A	now
A	but um
B	hey
A	knowing what I do about your navigational directional skills
B	yeah but if I had er
A	obviously you mean project directing the project not
B	direct the project
A	oh right
B	not actually navigate
A	no
B	us across the Channel
A	I see
B	because he very much knows that that'd be um
A	yeah
B	a death sentence
A	turns left
B	turn left
B	on the Norfolk Broads
A	your left or my left?
A	oh that's funny
B	yeah
A	no
B	well I well the first one has to be for profit
A	yeah
B	so what I'll
B	sailing the boat
A	uh-huh
B	in being sailed in the boat
A	yeah
B	by
A	do you like him enough to live in a boat a small boat with him for a week?
B	well I do like him yeah
A	yeah?
B	date
A	yeah?
B	A long it was a long time ago
A	rekindle a
B	but
A	involving twenty thousand pounds
A	sailing across the Channel
A	in barges
B	um
A	Cos if it is it's
B	it's a bit extreme
A	it's the latest in a long line of crazy
B	even by my standards
A	even by your standards
B	um
A	no
B	far
B	do you wanna go out for dinner? Well we are next Tuesday
A	well there you go
A	uh-huh
B	er the reason I invited him was because I know that he can sail
A	I see
B	sail
A	yeah
B	so that's why he's involved in the project
A	yeah
B	well you know the
A	yeah
B	embryonic stages of
A	of the project
B	tut
A	oh
B	so tut it's a plan
A	but if that all falls in?
B	if that all falls apart um I dunno what I'm gonna do with the money
A	yeah
B	a little bit now cos we're at the end of the month
A	yeah
B	but it's only a hundred quid so that's fine
A	yeah
B	overdraft gone
A	yeah
B	so that's a really nice feeling
A	yeah
B	exactly
A	so
B	so
A	that's pretty good
B	so this month so for April I'll keep it in my account and then the payment that'll come in for May for the
A	yeah
B	April recordings I'll put in my savings account for New York
A	mm
B	New York
A	oh your
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	it's certainly the plan that I've been telling everybody
A	yeah
B	that will take up quite a lot of the
A	yes
B	savings
A	yeah
B	more low key
A	yeah
B	for our thirtieth
A	but you would have a party here anyway wouldn't you? I mean
B	we'd have a party
A	well you'd go out for some drinks at some point er with the people that you know in Cambridge
A	let's be fair
B	just you
A	I'm not sure I can
B	beer
A	make it to New York but er I'll certainly
B	but er well even if I did go to New York there'll
A	mm
B	definitely be birthday drinks here
A	mm
B	because her birthday's November so we were thinking
A	yeah
B	we'd go like some time er end of November
A	oh that'll be lovely
B	certainly do something here
A	I'll have to tell you some places to go
B	tut
A	went to a gig there
B	mm
A	but like obviously the subways just go anywhere everywhere so
B	nice
A	a really nice building
B	mm
A	and it's like um it's a bit like imagine if like a sort of smallish theatre but with all the seats stripped out
B	mm
A	and so there's like a stage and it's got a kind of like dome sort of shape
B	oh okay
A	um and they have like bands on all the
B	mm
A	but it's just good
B	mm
A	like hipsters
B	mismatching clothes
A	see what's you know grandad jumpers and that and and it was good to just see sort of what was happening
B	tut
A	so
B	that's the thing isn't it
A	yeah
B	Cos we're only going for a few days
A	I'll have to try and find out where I went
B	yep
A	oh
B	tired with work um
A	how's she finding the apartment?
B	she really likes it
A	yeah?
B	last week into a hotel cos some authors came
A	yeah
B	and now she's back
A	mm
B	she's basically just managed to swing a job
A	yeah?
B	because they've I dunno if you've heard about it but they've split the responsibilities of our manufacturing department
A	oh right
B	so that half of them are in charge of stock levels
A	right
B	all that sort of business
A	mm
B	sourcing paper and
A	yeah
B	which is great but it means that some people have ended up with quite a lot of work on them
A	er er yeah
B	what is his name? And Peter
A	uh-huh
B	is in charge of procurement
A	yeah
B	so she's now got a line report in New York
A	oh my goodness
B	for two weeks? So er everyone's signing it off
A	oh
B	where the er yeah Thailand
A	mhm
B	and he's flying
A	oh my God
B	Cos I was thinking if you're in Thailand I know my geography's bad but would you not fly across the Pacific round?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	but I think some I um is it  is it  not about refuelling?
B	where you have to fuel
A	like sometimes would you not have to fly to Australia
B	yeah
A	and then on?
B	yeah
A	Cos there's too
B	I think that's it
A	all the way round
B	to New York
A	oh my God
B	horrendous
A	that's ridiculous
B	so it's gonna take
A	Cos when my friend
B	uh
A	lived in New Zealand she tried all different routes
B	yeah
A	she did like Cape Town to New Zealand
B	yeah
A	like er
B	lA
A	yeah
B	mm
A	that way
B	and then er they do Hong Kong
A	yeah
B	and then so you go to Dubai Australia and then New Zealand
A	yeah
B	and that's er it's just such a bitch
A	yeah
B	so when I got on the flight from Dubai they were like this is the whatever to Melbourne
A	oh no
B	no no I'm going to New Zealand
A	yeah
B	you're just having a little hour off
A	let you off
B	yeah
A	let some people off here
B	the Dubai stop-over was the worst though
A	yeah
B	have you flown to Dubai?
A	no
B	A you look like you're flying into the water so that's pretty terrifying
A	yeah?
B	Cos obviously it's right on the edge
A	yeah
B	and maybe it's because there's so many tall buildings or because it's there's a desert there but there's air pockets
A	oh
B	and it did this three times on the descent
A	pulled up? Wow
B	ascended
A	yeah
B	everyone's crying at this stage
A	oh huh
B	and then tried again and the same thing happened
A	oh my God
B	like
A	yeah
B	they were actually usually better than that though
A	oh God
B	and then they're like yeah two hours and then back on the plane
A	oh my goodness
B	yeah
A	that's true
B	that's why you do it
A	yeah
B	tut
A	would you like save up and do things like buy yourself something from Tiffany's and you know?
B	I know
A	can you not stay in a hostel or something? I mean unless er
B	yeah
A	it's your birthday though so
B	but if you can get um single
A	tut single
B	er single room it'd be okay
A	yeah
B	so yeah definitely
A	yeah
B	it'd be worth having a look to see what is available
A	yeah
B	so I'll have to start looking soon
A	but I think actually it's funny because the flights I mean it's the same sort of time of year that I went last year
B	yeah
A	and like if you go over a weekend it's a lot cheaper
B	tut
A	than if you go
B	you said
A	like if you wanna go on the Monday to come back on the Friday it's there must be so many people er from who are doing that from London
B	yeah
A	you know
B	so you're better off doing like Wednesday Wednesday or something
A	yeah
B	mm
B	yeah
A	but it's so good
B	a bit of
A	it's really I'd love to go back
B	oh
B	given that
A	I know
B	got a master plan
A	irons in the fire
A	oh
B	I think the fact that
A	yeah
B	managers and stuff like that
A	yeah
B	who get to go for good reason
A	yeah
B	but tut it would be good to be able to go
A	just they're closing down on everything aren't they though
B	yeah I know
A	no travel and
B	yeah
A	oh no none of this
B	well they say that
A	I know
B	I think it's all for show because
A	I'd love to see like you know some of their expenses
B	really? No
A	but
B	car
A	well I just it's kind of better anyway in some respects like er
B	yeah
A	you know get to look around and potter round yourself
B	well do you know
A	yeah yeah
B	getting like travel
A	oh I know
B	you don't spend any money
A	well
B	so when she went out she took five hundred pounds in cash
A	yeah
