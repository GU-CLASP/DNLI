C	in the nineteen twenties to produce a vehicle which was
B	mm
C	during the nineteen thirties Hitler got to hear about the project
B	oh yeah
C	and he desperately wanted to rival the Americans and be able to afford cars and erm they he they settles on an amount of money that the car would be built for which A was totally unrealistic
C	in the sense that they couldn't build it for that small amount and B was still way above the heads of most of the German population to buy
B	mm
C	so in fact the whole project was a disaster and it says that erm the only reason that Volkswagen succeeded was due to the corruption of the Nazi party
B	meaning what? they subsidised or?
C	presumably sold money to fund it
B	quite a history for the company isn't it? I don't think that many people associate with the Nazi party any more
C	and they
B	five marks a week
C	so they were supposed people were supposed to save five marks a week and eventually buy the car three hundred and thirty-six thousand people signed up to it but none of them
A	oh no
B	mm
C	did you know that Volkswagen the Beetle was designed by Porsche
B	was it?
C	Porsche a man called Porsche who of course famously started up the the Porsche make but erm he was responsible for the design and subsequently took a share of the Volkswagen company and now today he own Porsche the Porsche family owns fifty-one percent of Volkswagen
B	of Volkswagen? mm
C	which is the biggest
B	is it?
A	you can't believe they can have cheated like that
C	I was just saying to
C	a a there's a BBC and they've actually looked into the the history of the managing director who apparently two things first of all was desperate to get into the US market
A	mm
C	and he publiclysaid that the emissions that they the US demanded to to satisfy were too expensive to develop the technology for so he's quoted as saying that some time ago
B	America have stricter emissions laws that we do?
C	stricter emissions than Europe yeah
B	really?
A	no they well the they call buy a car
B	four by fours
A	so huge that it would cancel that out
C	well it's a little bit to do with diesel because Americans don't like diesels never have and of course they always had a reputation of being polluters
A	yes
C	whereas in Europe the diesel is a lot more popular
B	isn't it more efficient diesel?
A	it's a a a less polluting
B	I thought it was better yeah
A	in the modern diesels but now we're hearing that in fact the the thing that they used to measure pollutants against diesel now has a different one that is worse
B	oh cool
A	so erm sadly we went down that road and now fifty percent of the cars in Britain are diesel
B	because of Volkswagen lies or because of a general deception?
A	no because we the perception at that time was that certain things were the worst pollutants and diesel had less of those
B	oh
A	erm but now
C	that's true it's its CO two emissions whereas
B	measuring a different
A	yeah
C	diesel is apparently very bad because it it spews out particles little particles
A	and they didn't know about those at the time
B	I bet they did
C	which which are exactly very damaging to the lungs
B	so it creates smog doesn't it? diesel that's what I've heard
C	yeah so it's these particles which sort of are in the in the air that people breathe in
B	mm
C	which they think are really bad for you
B	mm thanks mum it's nice that bread
A	it's lovely bread isn't it?
B	mm
A	I I really quite like it chunky as well if you know if you have an if you have it like with some soup of something it feels
B	oh yeah I do as well but I don't enjoy the fact that I have to slice it before I eat it it's like one more step in the process
A	ah I must say I do usually have it sliced but sometimes I just can't be bothered to stand in the queue and wait for the little lady to notice my existence
A	and they don't have a erm
B	they should have like a self-service shouldn't they?
A	they don't have a bell or something you know they just er all you can do is wait
B	no that's true they should build a machine that normal folk can use just put it there
A	slice their hands off
B	it was quite hard to use I remember when I worked in the bakery in
A	it's getting it out the other end keeping it all together
B	yeah keeping the slices together
A	and lifting it onto the
B	and then it all gets a bit squished
A	mm
A	mm
B	have you ever had a Volkswagen then? no
A	I've driven one
B	Mini's are Volkswagen now aren't they?
C	sorry?
B	Mini's?
A	BMW
B	oh BMW
C	mm
B	cool
A	mm mm
B	one of the pictures was us in standing outside somewhere with this with the with the old really old BMW the white one
A	mm
C	the Granada was the best car wasn't it?
A	the Granada was cool at the beginning
B	the Granada oh you had a Mini and you had a
A	mm
B	what was that? was that a Ford?
C	Vauxhall
B	Vauxhall yeah
C	yeah
A	mm
B	got stolen
A	did he like the pictures of you when you were little
B	yeah
B	I don't know what it is he can't quite register it somehow
B	he's in the middle so
C	he had a complicated family didn't he?
B	yeah lots of mothers and fathers all over the shop
C	lots of step relationships going on
B	yeah the amazing part is how they all get together every Friday
A	mm
B	all the various wives of his dad
A	quite incredible
B	I know they're all really normal about it I mean it's not that simple
C	mm
A	mm mm
B	and erm
A	mm
B	the
A	mm
B	you know like we could it was obviously never said that that was case but we could infer that it was her choice not only because she's a quite difficult person to have around but also you know probably there's lots of they are friends but I think there's lots of complications under the surface
C	yeah
A	mm
B	they were friends originally as well
A	oh god
A	so remind me again
B	really different to her as well
[ANNOTATION]	Two people were friends for 8 years.	Neutral
A	let's have a recap
B	so
A	mm
B	and had a child with him a son he that's
A	mm
B	they then separated and
[ANNOTATION]	There were no children in the family.	Contradiction
A	dad mm
B	they had
A	mm
B	and then but
A	brought up the three children
B	brought up the three
A	mm
B	and he was fully inside their family
[ANNOTATION]	The kids were two boys and a girl.	Neutral
A	mm
B	although he does have a relationship with his father now his real father kind of came back into the picture but it's quite sort of erm and I think sometimes I have the sense he has a bit of a chip on his shoulder about now being the real son
A	mm mm mm
B	of
A	mm
B	not because of any blood reason I think you know it's more just different personalities isn't it?
[ANNOTATION]	The boy doesn't communicate with his father at all.	Contradiction
A	mm
B	and
C	yeah
B	so then they broke up and
A	did he stay with his mum?
B	he stayed with his mum and it was a really hard time
A	and of the three all three stayed with the mum?
B	they all stayed with the mum and I don't know what
[ANNOTATION]	The child lived with his father.	Contradiction
[ANNOTATION]	The child lived with his mother.	Contradiction
C	oh dear what the divorce you mean?
B	the divorce it was really not nice and
C	oh dear
B	and she was very erm broken like you know so it wasn't a good time but somehow it's ended up even despite that being quite mended which is amazing really and
C	he didn't know
B	he just didn't he just wasn't there
A	mm mm
B	you know but it's that kind of thing not that there's any resentment on
A	mm
B	person you know he's really unusually so he's got a lot of integrity he's provided a lot of he's provided a lot of good example you know as well and I think
[ANNOTATION]	IT REALLY HURTS	Entailment
A	mm mm
C	mm
A	so then he married
B	so then he married again and it just so happened that
A	oh my god
B	and they were friends subsequently so and then it again happened that
A	oh gosh
B	and by that stage they were quite
A	mm mm
B	and that's the youngest son and he I mean then the now the three of them are kind of
[ANNOTATION]	THIS WAS THE WORST DAY	Contradiction
A	so when
B	more or less but as time went on I think he spent more time with his father as well
A	okay
B	so it doesn't seem to em that he's closer to her in fact it might even be the opposite
A	no it's a right and so he would
B	he stays with the dad if he stays he doesn't stay with his mum cos it's just too difficult for them personally but they he sees his mum a lot and he's the most caring of her of all the children because the other children find it too her too difficult as a character and just have a lot of difficult you know problems really and I can see why she's very
C	mm
A	mm
B	to she's manipulative you know she's got things where it's like mm
C	oh right
[ANNOTATION]	ITS PERSONALLY HE WAS A SELFISH	Entailment
B	and you know she's
C	what's his surname?
A	it's easier
B	you want them to have the grandparents and not to want to keep them and values the family values are very strong in Israel like the the kind of bond is is is is erm very you know whatever has gone on as you can see in that whole mess of a scenario you know there's still a very strong sense of everyone having a certain commitment to each other
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	HIS NAME WAS NICE AND MIND WAS LITTLE BAD.	Neutral
B	which is how it always is family it's just different cultural
A	mm
B	mm
C	they all live close together then?
B	yeah they all live in
C	same part of
B	within striking distance and the kids as well growing up in
C	right
[ANNOTATION]	HE WAS SADIST AND HE ANGER OUR KIDS	Entailment
B	but the his sister is very much thought about
A	and that's a special city you know with a lot more complications
B	mm well
C	anthro what?
C	anthroposophical
B	you know er Rudolph Steiner it's a bit like
A	that's like in
[ANNOTATION]	HIS SISTER IS LIKE A DEVIL	Entailment
B	we
A	Camphill
B	Camp oh it is Camphill
C	Camphill oh right yeah
B	in fact but it's also like what's it called in Holland? m m m
C	Montessori
A	Montessori
B	Montessori
A	it's a little bit like
B	there are similarities
A	there are relations
B	yeah so not only because of that but he is quite an unusual sixteen-year-old I've met other children who grew up within that system and it's quite an alternative approach to development and education
B	really? so he's also a bit different isn't he?
[ANNOTATION]	The speakers are affiliated with the education profession.	Entailment
A	mm
C	yeah
A	yeah
B	normal yeah
A	not erm
B	no I don't mean
[ANNOTATION]	The speakers all enjoy their jobs equally.	Neutral
A	you know there's but the Camphill community in
B	mm that can be an aspect but no this is a normal school
A	this is yeah the same for theirs was a also a dual language so it was English-Dutch
B	cool mm
A	and they loved that and they liked that it wasn't just your average school
C	yeah
B	it's a great system erm and they in Israel they make sure that at the end you there's a kind of diversion with the normal school curriculum and the normal school system so that you do end up qualified to go to university
A	totally yeah well he went he's got doing maths at Leiden
B	mm Leiden yeah I remember you saying but from what I I've met a few people who went to those kind of schools and what I've I've just noticed that they're more innocent
A	mm
B	like you know when I was
A	mm
C	mm
[ANNOTATION]	The speakers have very few doubts about the learning processes.	Neutral
B	well you've worked with sixteen-year-old you know what they're like
A	mm
B	ninety percent of time you're thinking about going out and having fun and boys and all of this but he's not like that at all
[ANNOTATION]	The sixteen year old boy is aware he's being discussed.	Neutral
A	mm
B	he's got lovely friend but he's quite a sort of innocent naive boy
C	mm
B	he's a really sweet boy
A	I think that can happen as well if you're an only child
B	of older parents
A	and you haven't got of older parents
B	yeah
A	I think
[ANNOTATION]	The boy being discussed has no siblings.	Entailment
B	agreed it's like a very protected environment isn't it?
A	and even though she in a an an
C	mm
B	yeah there's something there isn't it? like he's very adult and very used to adult company like
A	mm
C	mm
[ANNOTATION]	The boy being discussed is violent and unpredictable.	Contradiction
B	he's sixteen and
C	mm
B	you know still very living and both have their careers going on and whatever but they're they're erm they're little family situation is just the three of them most of the time so it does make a difference I think
C	mm
B	but they're a sweet little family
A	mm
B	so yeah
C	yes so I was interested so so you were saying the
B	yes so
C	they they they set up there was some sort of state then before the official it was forty-eight wasn't it? after the war
B	forty-eight yeah I don't know exactly how it worked
C	so something must have happened before that
B	it did and there were
C	cos they had already migrated
B	erm there was a Zionist movement in Europe in the nineteen thirties which wasn't directly connected to the Holocaust it started before that
C	mm
B	so people had already started to go over in the thirties and set up farms and cooperatives Jewish farms and cooperatives they bought land from the Palestinians
C	okay
B	who live there at the time I don't know what the country was called before it was Israel
C	be Palestine
B	Palestine yeah so they went over bought land and started up communities and this was happening already before the Second World War
C	right
B	and then obviously in the lead up to the Second World War and during it a lot more people started to move and travel and emigrate to emigrate? migrate? I'm not sure to Israel to escape the persecution and I don't know what happened in these intervening years I think there was a lot of people in nineteen forty-five nine when the camps were liberated almost all of those people went to Israel
C	right
B	and erm I don't know why but I imagine it's almost similar to what's happening now it was like this is where our new home is this is where our better life can be you know because Zionism wasn't common necessarily it was like a movement that started up later but
C	but erm his grandfather was was a prisoner of war in Hungary was it?
B	was it I think they were both in a concentration camp his grandparents in Hungary and they escaped
C	oh yeah it's not the right word prisoner of war is it?
B	yeah no that's never mind
C	but they they they escaped rather than they were liberated in forty-five
B	they were they escaped
C	yeah
B	and they erm went to Israel in nineteen forty-four forty-five and then immediately I guess had a child but they joined one of these communities cooperative communities that had already been set up which were later called the kibbutz but the people that originally went were Zionists and very staunch socialists they were like
C	yeah
B	had a
C	no
B	and they wanted to establish this kind of utopian life in Israel that was their vision and that was the beginnings of Israel really I mean it became an official state only afterwards but a lot of land was bought from the Palestinian's before anyone drew any lines and started to make things complicated and I don't even really know I'm sure I've been told I don't really know how the the concept of the occupied
C	right
B	that erm the Jewish or Israeli army won and they claimed land during the war and that was the occupied what the occupied territories are now
C	mm
B	and ever since then they've wanted it back
C	I've got the feeling that was in the sixties actually
B	I think it was yeah so I guess in the first ten fifteen years there was just a kind of erm beginnings of the Jewish state
C	yeah yeah
B	and you know building it up and infrastructure and so forth and some very idealistic leaders who came and then there was a retaliation from the neighbouring countries
C	yeah
A	that's the hugely sad thing isn't it? that it's really hard to understand why all the neighbours want Israel
B	I know anti-Semitism?
A	and Israel has retaliated and fought for their rights
C	anti-Jewish
A	and so on and you know you you only have to meet
B	mm
A	and he he's now he still had that history it's his grandparents it's not
B	yeah there are still people living in Israel who who erm escaped from concentration camps in in Germany they're still alive you know?
A	and erm so you know you you can't underestimate the impact of that but of course they show a terrible face to the world in their fight back
B	yeah aggressive
A	aggressive
B	mm
[ANNOTATION]	the people were experimented on in the concentration camp	Neutral
A	and we know that but it's erm it's it's really hard really hard to you know you just you don't understand why everybody why does Iran and Syria and all of these people why do they hate the Jews?
B	just anti-Semitic means they only want there's only that's the only reason
A	but why? where does it come from?
B	yeah exactly it's true
A	why do you have to hate someone?
B	it's really just silly isn't it?
A	but then I mean it's huge I mean imagine say it was us if there's same country next door
B	next door yeah or all of them frankly
A	and they think you all should die
B	yeah
A	that's that's
B	well I think that's the justification between behind one of the justifications behind their aggressive military show
A	mm mm
B	you know whenever they are attacked form one side they show with incredible force that they're not going to sit down and not retaliate and why? because
[ANNOTATION]	Israel retaliates when under attack	Entailment
A	and you understand that history their history was that they were totally persecuted almost to the point of annihilation
B	exactly yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Jews were not persecuted	Contradiction
A	so now they're going to say
B	we are here
A	you won't be doing that again here we are
B	and it's the it's the kind of enormity you know Iran Syria Lebanon Egypt Jordan is the only kind of slightly neutral sitting on the fence
B	no idea why that is
A	thank god for them you know
B	you know all of these countries don't want Israel to exist it's not like you know erm
A	we don't get on we'll just
B	we don't get on or we want to negotiate our borders you know they say they want to annihilate it
A	mm
B	and it's kind of like if you don't show yourselves to be a very strong military force that's what's going to happen in that's their that's the idea you know
C	I suppose there's also the connection with the West isn't there? cos the Americans massively support Israel don't they?
B	they have done historically I mean Obama less so
C	armaments
B	but Clinton did very much so
C	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Israel do not get well with the USA	Contradiction
A	you can
B	there's a huge Jewish population in America that has to be erm part of the reason
A	has been
[ANNOTATION]	USA has a huge jewish population	Entailment
C	I believe so yeah
B	but not only not particularly large but let's say influential
C	mm
A	well yes but I mean
B	mm because yeah well Netanyahu's a bit off the loop
A	Israel appear to never want to have peace with the Palestinians and you think you think they could they could try harder
B	you do yeah but then if you look historically they did try harder
[ANNOTATION]	Israel will negotiate with Palestine in the future	Neutral
A	I know you've said that and explained it before but
B	and you have and it didn't work out why?
A	the other side also say you know well maybe they weren't ready then but they are now you know who who knows you can't
B	mm it's difficult I mean like with Gaza for instance first of all they were firing rockets into Israel you're talking about the war last year you know that is what started the you know fight
A	mm
B	mm
A	we know that but the the
B	so they are much weaker but they're also
A	the little the little rockets are like you know throwing a cricket ball
C	the Hezbollah
A	I know but what can the and the Palestinians have voted for them
B	so why would Europe stand for that? why would Europe stand in support of a terrorist organisation that doesn't make sense
A	they but they they're were vote elected
B	so? it's ridiculous you know
C	they were elected yeah it's not not it's not Hezbollah is it?
B	they represent a completely wrong value system
A	well we want
B	group of people more or less that have been attacking America and Europe and you know in in a way of of of complete violence it doesn't to me it makes very little sense that Europe takes their side that side because of the history
A	mm
B	of why Israel was established in the first place you know we have a responsibility
A	Europe takes the side of the the huge underdog
B	it's no I just don't think it's an excuse it's an underdog but it's you know it's essentially
A	it's it's the same way like erm you know the
B	and they shouldn't I mean it doesn't make sense that to call them the underdog either in the wider picture because Israel is a tiny country in the Middle East
A	no you only have to look at the pictures on the television
B	it's not no
A	and Israel are throwing bombs back
C	rockets
B	it's not true at all
A	in in times at night
B	the only reason why the the only reason why we didn't see the devastating effects of the missiles that were being thrown directed at
A	no but they're still huge I'm just saying in terms of size
B	it's not an argument
A	it's because that's what they've got erm so they are the underdog they are the the weaker erm they don't have that might they don't have the er capacity to inflict they have capacity to inflict some deaths
B	that's the nature of terrorism though is that these that is is they're groups which are less powerful in terms of military force
C	terrorism is the right word isn't it? yeah
B	they take other types of violent actions because they they're not they can't they're not an organised army
C	so it's terrorist against a nation
A	well I don't I don't understand that word
C	what?
A	because
B	that's not how simple it is at all
A	but it's the truth
B	it's not no but what happen listen to what happened in the with Rabin in the nineteen seventies they made an agreement
A	they told me that before I know
B	they gave the whole of Palestine
A	but we can't go back to the seventies
B	no but listen to what happened they gave the whole of Palestine er to as er as a country they withdrew the Jewish settlers from from the West Bank they split Jerusalem in half this was the deal what happened? the Palestine's the day after attacked Israel they didn't want that agreement they wanted Israel to be gone you know so they're not just wanting their own land and then we're all happy you know that's what the sensible good people on both sides want but the not cool and not sensible people on both sides want the other people to be gone
A	don't
B	so that's the problem
A	erm
B	you know cos those that those two extremities will never find a peaceful solution now why did people give up you know in Israel in terms of and they haven't completely I mean the left still
A	but like you like you're saying the trouble is that the majority of people in Israel are voting for the right who won't negotiate
B	now they are
A	and the
B	terrorists yeah
A	who won't negotiate and there we are
B	well yeah there we are buggered
A	stymied
A	but
B	justifying everything I'm just trying to put it in perspective because the media in Europe comes gives a very biased perspective of the situation
A	no I I I mean I started by saying it does remind us of the truth of what's in the people just to meet
B	not only that yeah
A	erm because it makes it real again you know that this is the the reality for Israel
B	mm and since then how many people have lost their sons and brothers and fathers in various wars and situations and I know it's the same for the Palestinians but that's you know a continuing wound isn't it?
A	it is the same for the Palestinians times a thousand
B	of course much worse yeah absolutely there's also always a lot more deaths and so forth but yeah for sure
A	and they don't have a normal life left they there's no
B	in Gaza no they don't
A	in Gaza there's nothing left for a normal life they're living in a a war zone
B	mm
A	erm which like you say you just can't understand why they can't vote for the right people and make a make a solution
B	yeah well that's what people feel in Israel as well you know
A	no I understand that
B	like the people who want there to be a constant effort towards a peaceful agreement and Netanyahu is not on that boat
A	mm no
C	mm
B	he's just not interested but the point the problem is is that people are disillusioned about the ability of
C	mm
A	mm
B	that kind of deal and people are distrustful of the Palestinian's because they're maintaining a
A	quite rightly
B	extremist government who aren't really not nice people
C	I find it's erm quite quite comparable with Northern Ireland in a lot of respects
A	I have always yeah
C	it's just full of hatred each side blaming the other no progress
B	mm yeah and it's just like you know in South Africa as well you know every day there are things happening to people which are racial as such in nature you know like encounters between Arabs and Jews within Israel or whatever that erm are negative and people develop this opinion of each other this very hateful and negative opinion
C	mm yeah that's right
B	and there's no er that's very difficult to heal it's very difficult to change you know and that's what I see most Israelis erm they even the best ones who have the most
C	yes that word
B	and ability to kind of see beyond the all those feelings
C	yeah yeah
B	you know they still feel very powerless really to
A	but the world is turning against them daily
B	the world is unsympathetic I know but you saw that in
A	mm
C	where where are you talking about?
B	no in Germany in France
C	oh in Germany
A	but it's
B	what's it got to do with the fact that they're Jewish for a start?
A	well that's who's doing it
B	I know but it can't like
A	so there isn't there's isn't
B	this is completely not fair representation of what's happening but I'm just saying you're exaggerating it in a way that's not fair
A	no I'm I'm just going to say they bombed I don't know how how long and how much but then the Israel bombed for ten days or six days or something just all day and all night so it's like a
B	it's not really what happened
A	you know the people it is it was on the news on the television all day the reporters standing there
B	no but
A	in Palestine and the place is just under
B	the first thing no fair enough it was a lot
A	well it was a lot erm
B	the first thing is is that they were constantly shooting missiles at Israel
A	and it was for most people in the world to much yeah but it's still
B	and Israel has this enormous defence dome over Tel Aviv
A	I know
B	but they're shooting missiles constantly towards Tel Aviv whether they hit things is another question but saying that they dropped two bombs over the border is not really
A	no they're trying to but they're not successful
B	mm
A	because Israel is mighty but just because they're trying then Israel obliterates them for days and days and days and days and days
B	they were targeting
A	you can't you can't justify that
B	it's a very big ant when it's the whole more or less Arab world who wants Israel to be gone
A	yeah but they're not fighting the whole Arab world there fighting
B	yes but they are in a way you have to see that
A	Palestine
B	no but you have see that it's all connected in that way as well
A	well I
B	it's partly what they're doing it's partly what they're doing
A	well it's not the world is quite rightly
B	yeah I know but I don't know that the world has a very fair perspective and it's not the world it's Europe America have always been in support of it
A	and I think the world's right no no
B	yes they have
A	there was not there was not support for the bombing there were talks against it and there there was a lot of quiet from America
A	which was noted and erm even words that this needs to stop now er
B	honestly I don't know what is justifiable any more I've seen too much
A	but when was it ever that you can't justify that
B	I think you can if you look at the greater picture
A	there's no justification in war
B	that's a very idealistic thing to say
A	well it's true though and it's why
B	was it not justified to fight against the Nazis of course it was I'm not saying that's analogous I'm just saying
A	yeah but then they thought the same was true to get rid of erm
C	Saddam
A	the Saddam Hussein you know he was a cruel erm dictator who would gas bomb people and they thought that erm apart from the torture and the misery inflicted on the people they thought that he had they the weapons so they they went and fought him and and caused havoc
B	of course
A	erm
B	I I know I'm just saying that in certain people's eyes there are justifications for those type of actions you know whatever from whatever side and and it's very complicated to say what's just and what isn't in that situation it's very very complicated and it's very deep in terms of
A	no I the trouble is is that you think well I I've no idea that
B	of course
A	and the weight of history is behind both sides in a different way
B	mm
A	and therefore unless you can stop looking back and look forward and stop relying on history's evidence to support your argument and your justification for carrying on killing people nothing ever changes
B	mm
A	and so I hate people saying this is justified because of A B and C because it's not justifiable to kill people for any reason and
B	ultimately that's true but it's not the way that things work is it?
A	well but then it it the how do you ever go forward if all you say is these are all of the reasons why I have to carry on being a murderer erm that's what they did in Ireland for generations
B	well I think honestly if Israel would do that it would be gone
A	no I don't think so
C	why would it be gone?
A	why would it be gone?
B	because because the if
C	I think that's a different
B	yeah but that's okay so two different things but
C	we're not talking about invasion I mean who who want to invade Israel
B	well all of the Arab leaders not all of them but the majority of them would would have spoken about
C	mm
B	and they have I mean Syria has invaded Israel Lebanon Egypt all in the last forty years
C	mm
B	so it's not like a
A	so yeah that's
C	I think it's a different issue to the Palestinian
B	I'm just saying if
C	because they are clearly erm relatively defenceless aren't they?
B	yeah
C	and they do resort to small scale terrorism which is the only thing they can do
B	mm yeah agreed agreed I mean the thing two things are mixed together as well because and as many people say they no
A	it's a miserable
B	I understand why there are demonstrations but I also feel that people have a very like Europeans that I've spoken to over over the years and with in the company of Israelis who want to talk about the situation have a very naive idea about this whole situation they don't know the history at all they don't know what's happened they don't know when even when Israel was established and why you know and it's like they have this kind of nice European left wing kind of approach to things
A	but
C	oh could be yeah
A	mm
C	mm yeah
B	but they're not realistic you know you have to know the facts and you have to know the the historical context of that kind of a situation to understand why Israel acts like it does and
A	the the the only thing is that there's there's will never be a way out unless the change what they're doing
B	mm agreed agreed
A	so
B	and I think that's what people feel as well but like
C	mm
A	mm
B	mm so I mean the people who want who who have always wanted to seek a peaceful two-state solution erm are being erm becoming outnumbered and they feel desperate too you know? nobody wants to live like that do they?
A	mm
B	like
C	mm
A	mm
B	and what's going to happen now in a few years' time?
A	mm
B	it's not optimistic and now ISIS and everything
A	horrible
B	mm
A	mm
B	I obviously have a lot of sympathy for them because you now these are my friends and they've been in army they're not like we just bystanders they you know have their whole lives have been affected by this situation and
C	yeah mm
A	mm
B	and they've had to fought fight for their country in war situations and go to the West Bank and see what people are like and see and be and see how people are treated on either side and so forth you know?
A	mm
B	so it's pretty real erm
A	mm
B	but
A	horrible
C	cos who are the people in control in Palestine it's not Hezbollah is it? it's the other one
