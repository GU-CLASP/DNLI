A	week after no he hasn't done much
C	is he doing anything on sociology?
A	I don't really know to be honest
C	I think he does do some work
A	he looks like he's working
C	what do you think about him wanting to be a fireman?
C	sorry
A	he just knows
C	well you say that
A	yeah I know I know but it
C	it was competitive in our day
A	do you know I don't think it was as competitive
C	yeah I do
A	well
C	I didn't get into any university did I?
A	did you try?
C	yes
A	oh did you?
C	yeah
A	well
C	I didn't get A levels no
A	no
C	so you you're talking about somebody
A	mm?
C	I've got one
A	did you?
C	yeah thanks for that
C	it's not it's not about
A	mm
C	communicate
A	I think
C	and he he can
A	he's better he's better
C	he can communicate
A	he can communicate
C	when I was his age
A	he's got an answer for everything he's quick witted and I think he will do fine but it's just
C	not if he goes in to try and be a fireman he won't
A	no no no he won't
C	it's not about
A	he's not empathetic
C	I think he is I think he is quite empathetic I think he's really objective at times actually
A	do you?
C	yeah
A	so what would you
C	I think he needs to go I I don't think he unfortunately I think he needs to go into some sort of management role
A	but how how how?
C	he needs to choose a field
A	yeah I
C	he's not gonna go into an area where you
A	such as?
C	er if you're looking at banking
A	no the accountants have to get qualifications they have to take their accountancy exams
C	I'd think he's not going to be able to do that
A	no
C	because he hasn't got
A	mm?
C	I think he could do that and I think he could manage people
A	yeah probably but how do you get him into that?
A	well
C	no drop him with
A	leave him there?
A	when?
C	I'd ask
A	well why couldn't you go up there?
C	he doesn't
A	per week?
C	he doesn't know
A	well
C	has he told you that?
A	er no but
C	does he does he know what he's gonna see?
A	no course he doesn't course he doesn't he's sixteen how would he know that?
C	really?
A	well
C	he hasn't done any of it
C	his whole life is gonna be
A	I don't know he doesn't appreciate that work's gonna be
A	no it's not
C	because he's gonna be a
A	mm
C	mornings
A	don't pull that face at me
C	no yeah you do need to to
A	but
C	I'd I'd hope he'd
C	show a bit more ambition
A	no he's not not on a fireman's salary absolutely not
C	yeah
A	maybe if he sees oh look as the manager of this place
C	I might have to brief
A	and maybe get
C	doesn't earn forty grand
A	doesn't don't they?
C	no
A	don't they?
C	a fireman?
A	I don't know
C	they might do
A	I don't know but
C	but not a starting one
A	no not a starting one but
C	does he? has he gone off the idea of doing an apprenticeship then?
A	he hasn't said so no
C	right they start on just over twenty-one a year
A	see and how old would you be when you're a station manager?
C	forty
A	it's not enough to live on is it?
C	I don't think so
A	no
C	does he?
A	I think so
A	one or the other
C	I'd rather
A	but you know if he if he could make a business out of it you know like you
C	yeah
A	do this we've got a LTA registered course it's this it's
C	yeah yeah
A	this competition
C	well er why does?
A	he's like really really wealthy from being a tennis
C	well why doesn't
A	I don't know
C	he could do go and do his work experience there
A	mm
D	er doing tennis
C	pardon?
D	didn't think you wanted
C	I'd rather he did that than
A	no one can understand you
C	I can
A	say it again
C	he said
A	we want him to do
C	you know?
D	ah
A	obviously
A	obviously
C	and I wanted to I my other ambition was always to have enough money that if I wanted to buy something I could go out and get it without having to worry about
A	for instance like a thirty grand car for your mum
C	that was top my
D	what his mum?
A	no
D	it didn't pull out today did it?
A	it didn't did it
D	we want a new car we do
D	don't want one of those
A	why didn't it pull out
C	why don't you take it to the garage then?
A	I don't know because it was a one-off
C	do you want me to take it to the garage?
A	no
C	do you want me to drive it
C	this weekend?
D	is it is it?
A	no yes drive it this weekend see what you think
D	this is like the
D	you could've died
A	no we couldn't've died but we did pull out of a really small gap
C	so yeah but those were those were my ambitions and and
A	and very rich
C	right
A	not gonna happen
C	now a fireman at the age of forty is likely to earn around forty thousand pounds
D	it's not a lot
A	no it's not a lot
C	no not really
D	how much do you earn?
A	doesn't matter
D	do you earn more than the average person?
C	yes I do
A	yes
C	yeah
A	so
D	a lot more?
A	do you still want to be a?
D	I want I wanna do dad's job I do
C	no you don't
D	you
D	cos that's your that was your one goal?
C	yeah
D	I bet you wouldn't like
A	why?
D	once you've had one week here and you've heard me and
A	yeah
D	he's out again
A	it's true actually they are very very annoying when they come home from school
C	well no cos you can take one of you out I could go and play tennis with one of you
A	the other one we could just beat
C	but
A	yeah
C	and now
C	I have to work away from home for
A	ridiculous
A	do you still want to be an accountant
D	erm do they get?
A	well you should just be Stevie G

C	you're not
D	no
C	no he's not far off he does alright
A	yeah but he's not Stevie G is he? he's not gonna
