A	and I was just like firstly I think you just behaved really poorly this weekend and you you made my weekend very uncomfortable
B	yeah
A	in a city that I really like
B	yeah
A	and she was like yeah sorry about that and I was like
A	okay I was like you you made it out like you were being ignored or left out of everything when you weren't
B	yeah
A	you behaved like a child like you were in school
B	yeah
A	and I just didn't wanna deal with it and she went yeah I know I'm really sorry like I get really jealous
B	you get what?
B	oh dear
A	like she was like well you know like just little things that I can't be involved in I was like yeah but you're never gonna be involved in everybody's conversation there's always gonna be a time when you're like left out you know when you're not involved in something cos you don't like like the subject or you're not as like you haven't seen the film or something like that
B	yeah yeah
A	and you can't get annoyed every time that happens
B	no just include yourself somehow
A	yeah just include yourself or just sit there taking it in and just accept that you are not gonna be able to comment on this conversation
B	yeah
A	and she was like yeah I know I really have to work on it and I'm really sorry and I kept getting more angry and angry because I realised that you were annoyed at me and I was like I wasn't annoyed with you I was just didn't care
B	mm
A	I didn't I knew what you were doing and I didn't care enough to have a fight with you about it and she was like yeah I'm really sorry I'll try and work on that in the future I was like god that's gonna happen again then erm and then I said and then I said erm I also felt like you were competing with me for the whole holiday on who knew Paris better
B	yeah
A	and I didn't understand it at all and she went yeah I was because it really upset me that you you knew Paris better than me and you're a foreigner
A	and I was like
B	okay
A	yep so
B	so?
A	so? like
B	life goes on
A	yeah I've been to Paris nearly every single year of my life of course I'm gonna know it well
B	yeah it's not it's not erm a bad thing
A	it's not even anything to compete over is it? and I was just like I don't understand your behaviour this weekend and you kind of ruined it for me and she went yeah I'm really sorry that's all she
A	yeah at least she agreed like er she and she acknowledged
A	yeah at least she acknowledged that she was being a bitch all weekend and I was just like I do not need like that's just
B	yeah that that makes me think that she's that would suggest to me that she was our age
A	yeah
A	or younger yeah like at school still I was just like I don't need it
B	be quiet about it
A	yeah
A	don't go don't go grumpy and she
B	yeah
A	and she was like oh but you spent time with
A	so you've been at a festival with a group of friends this week like what?
B	oh dear she sounds
A	very peculiar very strange but that's all sorted now
A	hopefully it should be fine erm
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	look smart and meet everybody and that was quite nice although I was on a table with like my all of the heads of commissioning somebody from
B	mm
A	they're all they all talk about their children they're like oh yeah it's weird when your children get to an age and they no longer need your help or advice I was like you're talking about my age
B	yeah hello?
A	I was like you're talking and bitching about people my age
B	yeah
A	so I couldn't really join in with that but and then obviously I went to
B	oh yeah how
A	really good
B	was it?
A	it was fine I didn't it wasn't I thought it was gonna be really
B	so not as bad as you thought it was
A	yeah I did it in two hours fifteen minutes roughly so I'm happy with that although on the Saturday I was just wandering around
A	oh yours is the big one cos I thought you might need more
A	er I got this text from
B	oh god
A	I was like
B	oh my god
A	you know when you're standing in the streets being like what the fuck?
A	like what? and I was like where are you? you utter creep like you just made me
B	that is really
A	so paranoid cos he always cos I was wearing my
B	mm
A	he was like I don't understand why you still have that hoodie it's just like weird
B	he brought that up?
A	yeah he was
B	nice
A	and I was like where are you you creep? he was like oh we just drove past you
A	and I went oh okay weird erm
A	yeah
B	hasn't moved on yet
B	who were you with?
A	I did it with my running partner
B	oh right
A	and her her husband came up so she is I think she is in her fifties and he's sixty-five or something erm and they were
B	oh no
A	I was like no no
A	right age and stuff but no they were like we're not her parents erm and then er she came back oh my god
A	I was gonna tell you on holiday and I was like no no no I've got to wait for
A	and I bumped into him and he was I was like oh my god what are you doing here? and he was like oh hi so we had a little chat like it was only a few minutes before the start and he was just like oh yes you know I broke up with
A	oh okay are you alright? and he was like mm yeah and then we went on this run and I didn't see him and then because I was I took Monday off erm I said are you around? do you wanna have a catch up?
B	mm
A	and so I went we had like a good two hour catch up actually in the
B	oh
A	it was really good erm and so and he talked about
A	and she's er she was like still in a relationship with
A	and then strangely enough after like on Monday evening her Facebook status had changed
A	so I don't know if
A	but erm
A	yeah he broke up with her
B	mm
A	yeah and he and he also cheated on her
A	I asked him
B	did you ask him? what? outright?
A	yeah outright
B	what did he say?
A	he just he
B	oh my god
A	apparently he was on like one of their retreats to Portugal one of their health retreat things
B	oh okay
A	she was like the beautician who went along like she did massages and stuff like that for the people
A	she's a bit of a dog though
B	oh really?
A	I know that sounds really horrible but like I just I Facebook stalked her obviously she's really like chavvy and
A	fake tanned and you know she looks a bit like she looks a bit of a slapper to be honest I'm not gonna lie but erm yeah he is no longer with
B	that is awkward
A	yeah like they've been together for like he said about seven years and he's in all pretty much of all of
B	that was not long ago was it? oh my god that is awkward
A	yeah
B	oh god poor
A	I was gonna say I don't I didn't think I'd ever hear poor
B	I can just I can just I can just feel what she's going through you know when you just sort of like
A	yeah
B	hence why you've put your boyfriend in sister's wedding photos
A	also when you've been together for seven years
B	mm
A	you kind of like like what was it? I saw
B	yeah
A	like made the er the the decision to do it cos you had been together for a very long time and stuff but
B	mm
A	he said
B	how gallant of him
A	yeah but it's the same as like
B	mm
A	I just don't think there's any couple left from school now
B	mm
A	well from our group anyway
B	yeah
B	wow
A	yeah it completely slipped I was gonna text you like the moment that I found out and I was like no no no I've got to wait until she gets back from holiday she just
B	you just need to see my face
A	yeah and she doesn't wanna really like this this
B	no and if I had told
A	yeah you would've been like you
A	the understanding of what just happened
A	of what went down
B	no
A	so yeah
B	wow
A	but you see
B	that's good
A	he seems fine actually
B	that's good I suppose he's probably seen
A	yeah cos obviously
A	he didn't say I don't he didn't like imply that they had a massive argument or that she hated him I think she was just
B	really upset
A	really hurt by it yeah
B	mm
A	he was like we used to argue all the time about stupid stuff
B	mm
A	and she used to storm off in a mood and
B	I can imagine her being really hard to argue with
A	oh yeah I can imagine her just being like if she doesn't get her own way she would stomp off until she does
B	yeah and he'd always have to go to her
A	yeah mm
B	oh well she'll find someone else I'm sure
A	probably quite soon
B	probably I bet he will as well to be honest
A	mm yeah
B	he's in that right sort of erm
A	I don't know I'm not sure what you're trying to imply
A	oh yeah
B	he's in a job where he always meets people
A	yeah
A	and he said he's er he's been going on a few dates with this girl
A	yeah she's on Facebook seriously she looks like a right tramp
B	oh this is the person that he?
A	yeah
B	oh
A	he cheated on her with yeah
B	that he's
A	yeah
B	that was probably the the beginning of the end then wasn't it?
A	yeah
B	when he cheated on her
A	he also said that
B	yeah
A	like if you don't wanna move in with your girlfriend of seven years
B	yeah
A	because you're worried it might not work
B	that's the time
A	that's the yeah you should be like enthusiastic about moving in with your girlfriend not
B	mm
A	he was like yep
B	probably not
A	no
A	yeah she's completely different
A	oh god apparently she went to
B	is er
A	it's in
B	yes I've got two mutual friends
A	mm
B	and she works at
A	yeah at the
B	mm
A	so this is gonna sound really horrible of me but she's probably not the brightest bunny in the forest but
B	mm
A	but then no offence but
B	no
A	yeah he wasn't the brightest bunny in the forest
B	and
A	yeah
A	not yeah obviously not that yeah yeah
B	wow big news
A	no
B	even at all like I'm trying to think of like people that were at school
A	I genuinely can't think of anybody from school who's still together
B	well
A	who was that? who is she with now?
A	can't think of him
B	they were in art in
A	oh well I obviously blanked him from my memory
B	just them two
A	yeah
B	flying the flag
A	they're done and dusted now
A	I did say to
B	but then again I
A	mm well no I think people always get back together
B	mm
A	I think people break up then get back together and then
A	either yeah er either they're gonna get married and stay together forever or they're gonna break up
A	yeah
B	like me and
A	exactly like you and
B	don't bless him
A	okay sorry I will not bless
B	lucky
A	oh no play yeah we've got erm
A	somebody somebody in my office who left he was head of marketing he was part time what he does part time is like do create er create write plays and produce plays and erm our team are going out as like a team outing
B	oh
A	to go and see him on his opening night
A	I don't know if he knows that we're going but we are
B	he's not he's he's not acting in it though? he's
A	yeah
B	oh he is?
A	he is he's acting directing
B	is it a monologue?

A	no
B	I've produced directed and starring in my own play
A	it's called the man who stars produces and directs his own play

A	if I hop off for a moment it's cos I've got to change the CD
A	oh
B	have you got
A	she's well I'm supposed to be catching up er catching up with her in the afternoon but we haven't really planned anything and
A	pardon?
A	the problem with
B	mm
A	cos it's really difficult for some reason to get to
A	but she er so
A	and then she messaged me
B	what? with the team?
A	yeah I had my first netball match two weeks ago
B	how did it go?
A	it went really well really well played centre for three quarters
B	oh cool
A	oh good god I couldn't get my piercing out
B	mm
A	one woman tried to help didn't realise it was a screw and tried to like yank it and I was like ow you are actually like pulling my tragus and she went well oh er are you
A	I couldn't so I didn't play for the first quarter because you're not allowed to play with any piercings in
A	but luckily we had enough people though and then I managed to get it out but I had to go to the there's like a tattoo piercing shop in
B	is it a hoop?
A	yeah I don't like it very much I prefer just a plain stud but I need it I need one that can come out easily but erm but yeah no I played really well and I got an email from the captain being like you played really well for your first match I'm really impressed and you're
B	woo
A	you're an asset to the team apparently so
B	oh wow
A	I was like yay
B	all that school netball paid off
A	yep school netball but erm but no yeah apart from that it's been a bit just been chilled had a little
B	good
A	so yeah
B	I might go home this weekend I don't know cos my
A	mm
B	but
A	mm
B	cos
A	what's wrong with him?
B	he's just an alcoholic
A	I thought yeah I thought he was but I was like is that the
B	no
A	mm
B	mm
A	it's not his fault but
B	mm
A	oh it's one of those things where it's like you don't really wanna be there but you probably should go back and support your mum
B	I know cos
A	yeah
B	cos he can't be bothered with it he's very black and white you know he doesn't get things like that
A	yeah
B	he will just sort of he'll probably go out
A	mm like my mum's like do you wanna come to
B	mm
A	cos I know that she struggles with it like
B	yeah and er
A	yeah
B	I suppose if I can be helpful maybe
A	well if not
B	okay I'm definitely going
A	well I sent her a message a few weeks ago just being like haven't heard from you in a while how's it going? and she sent me a message being like oh I'm on holiday
B	yeah I saw her holiday pictures
A	yeah
B	I didn't see him I just saw her
A	okay I'm
B	no I haven't seen him I I might agree with you
A	erm and so and then she sent me a message she was like oh hi I'm back from holiday it's
A	it's so close she's gonna come here and then I'm gonna drive us into town and do that and we're just gonna do some shopping
B	it's erm it takes
A	yeah
B	it's really close
A	but yeah she's just gonna come here for the day and we're gonna go into town and do some shopping and just have a catch up really she needs to get some work clothes so
A	did she?
A	oh no she just likes riding I think
B	oh I see it is it is in
A	yeah
A	yeah so she's got like
A	he kind of was really heavy then he lost a bit of weight and then he just put it all back on
B	she's not looking too bad though
A	no she's looking
B	yeah
A	not like erm
B	no
A	but she's always been quite
B	with a large boyfriend
A	yeah I actually I I was really
A	yeah I was like I know it's hilarious isn't it? I was like they both look like Mr Bean
B	what does
A	but he's just a bit better
A	he genuinely just used to look ill though didn't he?
B	I'm gonna try and find a before and after
A	oh er I I definitely did find
A	she just has really bad taste
B	oh
A	oh my god that's
B	yeah I know but er
A	oh
B	what is it
A	I mean I me and
B	no
A	like it'd be it'd be weird you know it would be more likely that he'd fancy me then fancy
B	maybe he likes maybe he really likes personality maybe
A	cos I have an amazing personality
B	maybe he maybe he saw something in your personality that he liked
A	true maybe
B	mm
A	a bit shaggy wasn't he?
B	mm
A	he's bulked up now he's really muscly
B	I haven't got him on Facebook though
A	you're not Facebook friends?
B	I haven't had my Facebook for ages
A	have you not?
B	like
A	she was like look at him he wasn't he wasn't very good looking was he? shit
A	and then we had to go back and double check
A	and she was like oh my god oh my god
B	that's so embarrassing
A	cos what do you do? like it's gonna
B	from fifteen years ago
A	yeah
A	erm were you Facebook stalking me by any chance?
B	it's like Instagram when you scroll down
A	yeah
B	and you get to like eighty-three weeks in and you like something that's really obviously that you've obviously been
A	stalking
B	stalking I've only got him erm
A	I yeah is it him looking up at you?
B	mm
A	yeah I think that's the same I don't really know I don't really look at
A	mm looking very brown though
B	yeah he always looked really brown though
A	I've also got some other news which is not as good
B	what?
A	er my mum might be made redundant
B	oh god
A	yeah
B	why?
A	cos erm you know they're being made into an academy?
B	yeah
A	they literally all came in on Monday so they had a week back came in on Monday and the head teacher was like pretty much all your jobs are at risk
B	as in the whole staff
A	yeah well er all the admin
B	okay
A	I'm not sure about
B	shit
A	all the heads of houses have been not heads of houses that's a Harry Potter reference
A	all the heads of year have been made redundant but don't tell anybody cos I don't know like mum's job is up is one of the candidates for redundancy
B	so like are heads of year teachers as well? they've been made redundant anyway?
A	I don't think they're teachers I think heads of year are just people who are like who look after the year group
B	like
A	possibly yeah I think they actually created roles specifically
B	oh okay so
A	for people who are head of year erm but I think because mum's probably one of the highest paid admin staff she is at risk
B	I hate these things cos they all like obviously they've gotta cut money don't they? so they're just like oh get rid of her
A	yeah
B	because she's really expensive but then shit happens down the line
A	yeah
B	because you're not
A	cos you don't have an exams officer
B	yeah
A	and
B	is that your mum's friend?
A	er the one
B	yeah
A	so yeah they're literally hacking hacking
B	can't they just hack people back that aren't as important? that sounds really horrible but
A	like teachers?
B	well people that are sort of less lower like less paid
A	mm?
B	and hack back more
A	yeah
B	and then
A	apparently all four deputy heads are keeping all four PAs though
B	oh great
A	yeah so you might not have an exams officer but at least you have a secretary to write up all the notes when parents complain about the fact that you don't have an exams officer
B	yeah and write all the reports for you
A	yeah
A	apparently so with four PAs well one no one head teacher and four deputy heads sorry and all four of them have PAs
A	I don't know how many
B	true
A	cos they've just taken on the the year
A	eights and sevens haven't they? but yeah so I'm not entirely I'm just not sure what they're thinking because no offence but mum's job is really important
B	what are they gonna do
A	I don't know
B	are they gonna
A	I er genuinely don't know like no one else
B	do it differently?
A	like how else can you organise exams?
[ANNOTATION]	They have taken on for two years	Contradiction
B	cos you've got like a lot of experience going
A	yeah
B	she knows what she's doing
A	but like mum's worried that they'll make them both redundant and then get them to like get her and
A	I'm like well you're gonna have to aren't you?
B	yeah I suppose I suppose you have to
A	yeah
A	so yeah
B	not very nice
A	sad times it's just so stupid to bring them back one week after
B	should've done it before term even started
A	yeah cos then it gives them the chance to find a new job like
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker's A mum is worried that they'll make them both redundant	Entailment
B	yeah
A	all the postings for schools would've come up during the summer holidays
B	yeah
A	so now all of these people who work in the school won't be able to get jobs really until next year
B	no
A	if they want to go back into education
B	yeah
A	so
[ANNOTATION]	People that work in the school will get jobs	Contradiction
A	yeah she could work for like
A	but I don't know she literally found out on Monday and that was dad's sixtieth birthday so
B	oh
[ANNOTATION]	She could work for 5 months	Neutral
A	cos we were gonna drive over to
B	I remember you saying
A	and then so she rang up and was like don't come like I can't really go out for lunch and celebrate when all these people are at risk of losing their job and then she rang back an hour later and was like actually I might be at risk of losing my job it was like oh fuck
B	but still
A	but it's still like just the mental side of just
B	oh my goodness your mum will literally become addicted to online poker
B	she will
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker's A mum will get addicted to online shopping	Contradiction
A	and do nothing for like the next
B	this can't happen
A	the next thirty years of her life
B	this can't happen
A	no dad's like you have to do something
A	yeah
A	she'll know er know Buffy inside out she already knows Buffy inside out
B	she can't do that
A	no Buffy what else would she start watching? she'd start
B	she wouldn't even care anymore she'd just start watching it
A	no she she
[ANNOTATION]	she is familiar with Buffy	Entailment
B	or she'd just go wild with the credit card
A	she can't go wild with the credit card she hasn't got any money
B	but just imagine the temptation
B	true
A	she wouldn't
A	no it'd all be his
B	I can imagine her strolling around the kitchen thinking oh I really need a
A	new mixer
B	yeah
A	oh
A	no you don't
[ANNOTATION]	she is rich	Contradiction
A	she'd have to ask him for money
B	oh no oh no she'd hate that
A	she would hate that so much she still has
A	I I don't know what she does with her money
B	we've
[ANNOTATION]	she loves to ask for money	Contradiction
A	yeah
A	like I think she gets paid something like twenty-six thousand pounds which is about say hypothetically it's fifteen hundred a month what does she do with it?
A	she doesn't have any bills to pay cos dad pays them all she doesn't have a mortgage to pay cos it's done
B	she buys shit
A	what the fuck?
B	gambles it all away on
A	she probably does and buys bloody cook books
B	cook books and box sets
