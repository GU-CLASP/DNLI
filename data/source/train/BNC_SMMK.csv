B	okay
A	could do
B	except Chiquitos
A	yeah

B	oh right

B	yeah I mean just if you'd like to see her then it's an idea
A	it might be nice
B	we could still eat with your parents and then go out
A	yeah
B	well it's going to take us at least an hour to cook and eat
A	yeah
B	mm
A	okay I'll I'll just give her a text her then
B	yeah
A	and I haven't seen her for ages far too long
B	yeah
A	ha and

A	it's probably initials
B	oh that's er
A	impressive
B	Bling
A	very bling
B	it looks quite good
A	what was it?
B	Aston Martin
A	was it? I didn't see it
B	can't quite believe you didn't recognise that
A	I wasn't particularly looking
B	so when I said look at that what were you doing?
A	I just looked up and saw a yellow car go past
B	the shape of it would have given you a clue
A	it that's that's not obvious to me
B	what's in front of us?
A	jaguar
B	had a mini me inside it
A	ha ha
A	yeah it might be nice actually cos
B	oh dear
B	huh
A	er yes it is
B	I was going to say something it's sort of like being stuck in the middle of nowhere
A	mm
B	mm
A	oh maybe no it's not here
B	yes
A	awf
B	can I have the ball park? Was it sort of last century? Obviously last century but
A	erm I'm not positive and I don't  I don't  know if that was already shut by the eighties or whether it shut in the eighties
B	oh with Thatcher right
A	yeah I don't know if it was one of the pit closures or whether it had already gone by then
B	yes that was good
A	yeah it has
B	yes it was rather
A	weather wise and activity wise
B	if by activity you mean lying in yes
A	ha ha
B	yes indeed
A	hmm
B	ah
A	yeah Wapping as in the place is W A P P I N G
B	look at all this art
A	mm
B	shall we go and have a look there later
A	ha ha
B	shits and giggles
A	could do
B	I was being serious
A	what
B	yeah
A	well it'll be shut when we get back
B	oh okay fine
A	I imagine
B	yeah sure
A	yeah
B	mm
A	mm
B	and how was that spelt?
A	W A P P
B	oh so Wapping not whopping
A	but but Wapping in London is pronounced whopping
B	mm
A	ha ha
B	lawn tennis and football club
A	mm
B	cricket
A	hmm mm
B	mm
A	hmm mm
B	what's the difference between lawn tennis and tennis?
A	I imagine lawn tennis you play on the grass
B	mm
A	so there's like asphalt type
B	asphalt
A	and then sort of is Wimbledon on grass or not?
B	think about that
A	I am I
B	course it is
A	is it? That's the thing I genuinely don't know
B	can you not bring back to bring back from when you've seen it on television it's on green shit
A	yeah but it could have been any kind of green shit
B	no
A	it's so well tended
B	it has by the end
A	oh
A	and yeah cos that's why some tennis players don't do so well in is it the big American competition where it's on a hard surface?
B	the American Open
A	yeah and they don't do so well in that because of the surface
B	no I don't know
A	no
A	it's interesting isn't it? Well I think people are interested but they don't actually want him particularly to win
B	no it's not that
A	yeah but
B	well he's too good
A	well yeah he is
B	and he's not particularly nice
A	he's not very nice
B	Chance
A	chance
B	yeah it was him or was it
A	exactly
B	he got to the semi finals once or twice and the quarter finals quite a lot
A	yeah he was sort of
B	ah
A	I don't remember ever really I didn't really watch much tennis
B	well Peter Sampras was sort of
A	oh right
B	erm he's sort of yeah probably one of the best of world players the world's ever seen
A	what nationality?
B	american
A	mm
B	erm but it was just and he was a nice guy
A	yeah
B	and the interesting thing was that he and like his
A	Nadal
[ANNOTATION]	he is a Nadal	Neutral
B	yeah just I mean Federer seems quite nice but Nadal doesn't
A	Nadal is the grumpy one?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	and Federer seems fine
A	ha ha as sportsmen go
B	yeah
A	that sign is wobbling really
B	yes
A	mm
B	well he had actually I think he'd put Henman out of the semi-finals on one occasion
A	mm
B	er which was a bit sort of oh
A	yeah
B	yeah but the point is they were both nice people
[ANNOTATION]	both of them is nice people	Neutral
A	yeah
B	that's kind of what I was going for
A	yeah they're doing it to bond and make friends and ha
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about a film	Contradiction
A	play tennis with people they like
B	yeah
A	maybe he's fine
B	well I don't know if you you can tell a certain amount from the amount of times people argue something with the umpire
A	yeah
B	as in he does it quite a bit
A	yeah
B	and Henman virtually never did it
A	yeah
B	I think well yeah but even not
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about one person	Entailment
A	yeah I'm just gonna get it on with it
B	indeed
A	what Henman?
B	henman and Sampras
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	they ganna get it	Entailment
B	I think he was just a very good solid player
A	yeah exactly
B	A bit like Beckham really
A	ah but Beckham was outstanding though
B	was?
A	I don't know if he is really now
B	hang on
A	beckham?
B	yeah
A	striker
B	oh I thought he was a midfield
A	no striker
B	yeah
A	but erm he scored a lot did Beckham
B	mm
A	and I think sometimes in football there's a very fine line between something being a really really good move and something just being a foul
B	yeah indeed
B	forty
A	is that what it was last time? I can't remember
B	no
A	oh
B	I vaguely understand it being fifty but forty is pushing it
B	just drop down
A	well you'd think the Angel of the North would make people drive a little slower anyway
B	why are we in a forty? For the love of God
A	Cos there's some cones by the side of the road look
B	oh
A	ha ha
B	I'm sorry I am just gonna treat that as optional
A	what because it's so stupid?
B	well because the traffic's flowing
A	yeah at this speed
B	we would actually be impeding traffic flow if we were doing forty
A	no I know
B	there's no reason not to
A	what is?
B	well there's
A	no it's not
B	mm
A	just art
B	no was it like a millennium thing?
A	erm I think it was about the millennium
B	you didn't see it before that?
A	no
B	fair enough
A	it it's quite good
B	mm
A	but I like it
B	yes okay
A	and it's become so iconic that I I don't think people really think about it anymore
B	yeah
A	I think it still is green
B	can you not stripe it?
A	yeah exactly
B	oh good
A	yeah
B	the only noticeable difference
A	yeah
B	indeed
A	never mind
B	so it should be sixty
A	huh?
B	it's slightly deceiving
A	I've seen quite a few of those today?
B	now it's sixty
A	is there?
B	that car but one
A	oh okay
B	it's a it's either I think it says eighty
A	uh-huh
B	it's like Top Gear's drivers of different cars last time
A	ha ha yeah
B	yeah
A	ha he drives a bike ha
B	why
A	ha okay
B	we're going a little bit faster then
A	it looks like it says eighty
B	oh it is an says eighty
A	yeah it's eighty
B	okay
A	there you are
B	I'm sorry
A	two point five T
B	turbo
A	ah
B	kind of Ebox going the other way
A	mm
B	it's not that big
A	it's quite ugly but it's
B	I think it's ugly in a charming way
A	ha ha
B	yeah is it? It's not the next left is it? It's after that
A	um yeah it is after that yeah
B	is that a new building they're putting up?
A	looks like it doesn't it? Flats presumably
B	it's like when you want to put them up a lot of them are pulling down
A	yes
B	which around here I'd have thought it was more likely to be the latter but
A	it could
B	well you think they'd demolish them with explosives
A	unless there's too much stuff around it too close to it
B	mm you'd be surprised what you can do
A	mm
B	mm maybe
B	mm
A	do you know what I mean? They build sort of slightly lower wider
B	well the structure  should still be the same regards of the time
A	no it it just seems like an a kind of an unusual thing to be building
B	excuse me
A	Excused
B	excuse me
A	Excused
B	excuse me
A	ha ha
B	er
A	so where do you wanna try parking?
B	has that hit you yet?
A	yes it has
B	I didn't think it had
A	I thought it had
A	ha
B	erm
A	shall we just?
B	it's okay
A	cool
B	actually have I? I might not have
A	okay
B	yeah cos before I was gonna park as close to M and S as possible but if we're gonna walk along the entire length anyway it doesn't make a difference
A	if you're gonna go to M and S and the Apple Store then it doesn't make much difference
B	right
A	so if we erm
B	ah
A	yeah
B	because I want to go immediately left
B	oh dear
A	yeah it's really bad
B	who was?
A	I was panicking quietly in the back
B	why?
A	sitting in the middle of the Hash
B	but you were in a Range Rover or something weren't you?
A	no we were in
B	oh yeah
A	I say
B	where?
A	to the left
B	ah
A	ha
B	er
A	yeah
B	oh no there's probably worse places
A	yeah and I guess you you know if you wanna go to Newcastle you wanna stay somewhere rubbish
A	you can go in the red at the next left yeah
B	I know I know
A	it's very confusing round here
B	it is confusing
A	it's really badly er
B	as in I've got lost on a number of occasions
A	it's badly signposted
B	well when I say lost
A	ha
B	no no
A	oh right
B	are we  Are we  planning to going straight on? Right
A	I think she was planning on taking her time
B	yes
A	all my favourite places are round here so I'm trying to
B	mm
A	hopefully it's not going to be too busy
B	yeah there'll be some spaces
A	yeah
B	not sure those dungarees a good look
A	hmm
B	yep
A	or that very very see-through T-shirt
B	what?
A	yeah there's loads along here
B	I didn't notice the T-shirt
A	the the the friend yeah the friend of the girl in the dungarees
B	ooh there's ones up there actually
A	there's loads
B	well you're might as well if you can

B	that'll do
A	yep
