B	I'll try and ignore him
B	that might be eh an acoustic issue
A	do you think that'll be an acoustic issue?
B	yeah
A	yeah you gotta use
B	in fact I imagine that in these conversations the word self-conscious is gonna come up a lot more than normal
A	actually for the first couple of minutes people generally think about it but then they they normally forget quite quickly
B	just delete the first couple of minutes then
A	yeah
B	mm

[ANNOTATION]	they are not sure about time for playing	Neutral
B	whenever that was
A	em that was it was  it was  Wednesday I think

A	I'm very impressed you do
B	sure I it I was kind of partly watching TV partly trying to get some professional networking admin done
A	mm
B	Cos I'm I'm setting up a website
A	right
B	and I'm trying to use them all and integrate them
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about integrate them	Entailment

A	that's quite a lot of fiddling about with them
[ANNOTATION]	person A is talking about fiddling	Entailment

A	mm
B	em
A	mm

B	this coming Tuesday
A	this coming Tuesday? Oh the this coming Tuesday? Ah sorry
B	mm
A	and
B	mm
A	but anyway yes
B	yeah
A	mm
B	works in
A	cool
B	which reminds me I should really em send out the newsletter this evening this afternoon eh
A	presumably it's sorted it just needs sending? To folks
B	em not really no
A	oh right
A	oh well you can write it and send it
B	yeah
A	I actually really need to do a Corpus newsletter
B	yes
A	fair enough
B	so em
A	I'm assuming there wasn't the promise of future ones it was just here is a newsletter? Be grateful
B	em I'm not sure  I'm not sure  Em the London professional network used to be quite organised and active
A	mm
B	and have a regular one but
A	right
B	I think the leadership might have changed and
A	mm
B	the previous  The previous  guy was eh a proper high-flyer
A	right
B	lots of people involved
A	right so he
B	he was kind of big on the
A	mm
B	well it's yeah
A	yeah
B	em for a graduate and I think he won the  won the  new civil engineer graduate awards one year
A	shit
B	A proper high-flyer
A	how do you win that like is it? Is that through your
B	by nominations I guess
A	through your  company?
B	I'm not sure  I'm not sure
A	yeah seem
B	I don't think it should be restricted to companies really
A	well is it kinda through your organisation or is it through your university one you know
B	I don't know
A	kind of once you graduate this person will be awesome or yeah
B	em I don't know
A	mm
B	Cos this year  this year  another EWB person em got a em a commendation in the graduate awards
A	mm
B	didn't she wasn't an official runner up you know there were a couple of official runners up and there was a winner and then there were a few
A	mm
B	highly commended
A	that's pretty good
B	why is why do camo jackets so often have German flags on?
A	I don't know
A	of course yes he did
B	mm
A	mm
B	was rescinded in Germany
A	was it only last year?
B	yeah
A	mm
B	hardly heard anything about it
A	right
B	I think
A	it was already quite relaxed though wasn't it?
B	no
A	just you just don't have to do it
B	the same it's the same for everyone as it used to be for women optional
A	well that makes sense
B	yeah
A	oh I hadn't actually thought about that the fact that what did they do about the women
B	so I mean the majority of people would do zivildienst anyway
A	would do what sorry?
B	zivildienst
A	civil
B	so if you'd send them a letter saying you know I'm a pacifist and I do not want to do this
A	mm
B	lots of people aren't necessarily pacifists but do
A	but don't want to it
B	don't want to do it
A	fair enough
B	em em but then you em can do your national service as em well social work
A	yeah
B	kind of thing em which I think would be a really good thing
A	I was just about to say that would really make a lot of sense
B	mm
A	you know and you could do you know whatever suited you better and yeah they could really get quite a lot out of that
B	if civil service didn't already mean something else in English
A	mm
B	then it'd be a good eh good name
A	yes indeed
B	if we could come up with a good name for it
A	mm
B	it would be good
A	I'm not sure any politician would really be eh make a big deal about it unfortunately
B	mm
A	true yeah
B	which is I don't know
A	you could maybe write to him and
B	mm?
A	you write to him
B	yeah you've used
A	yeah
B	speaking of em Conservative eh Cabinet members
A	mm
B	I saw one yesterday
A	really?
B	the Secretary of State for International Development
A	mm
B	he was giving a talk
A	or did you just see him wandering around? Yeah
B	well I suppose I could have accosted him afterwards he was just standing outside but em I don't know
A	right
B	because majority of the audience were students who had been to the em alternative careers fair that day
A	mm
B	em so more what he was doing was em trying to encourage people to into international development jobs
A	mm
B	and more specifically em the new DFID graduate scheme
A	okay
B	em which sound all sounds pretty good actually
A	mm
B	he wasn't  He wasn't  all he wasn't at all political about it anything really
A	yeah
B	otherwise they just
A	it was sensible
B	otherwise all of the em the non Conservatives would be like nope okay I'm not gonna  not gonna  do that job
A	yeah
B	he even said he even praised Claire Short
A	fair enough
B	shocking
A	yeah
B	although I think he did use the eh
A	oh well
B	and there were some
A	of course he didn't get his
B	there was some moments in his talk when it was quite clear he was using stock kind of phrases
A	mm
B	that the PR department had come up with
A	right
B	talking about the
A	yeah
B	which is apparently going on at the moment
A	right
B	on the basis that they're a giant country
A	but they have
B	but they have massive resources
A	yeah
B	they are a big capable
A	yeah
B	em
A	mm
B	so actually I agree with that
A	yeah
B	it is
A	it means the people who need it can get it rather than the people who really don't need it are getting it
B	yeah
A	okay so did he talk about that then?
B	and a so that so his phrase he
A	blimey
B	but em no it was alright
A	oh
B	I suppose
A	yeah
B	but
A	what if you hear him on a
B	mm
A	no Labour bashing
B	he went to Jesus
A	oh yeah
B	mm
A	mm
B	mm
A	mm
B	and em basically saying I wish this grad scheme had existed when I was
A	right
B	looking at things
A	oh so she's quite young to be a political advisor
B	mm
A	matric two thousand and one graduate two thousand and
B	sPS naturally
A	naturally
B	started
A	em twenty-one two thousand and four
B	started working for Conservative MPs
A	so she's under thirty
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	I don't want there to be six years between me and thirty
B	oh there's more
A	that's alright then
B	mm
A	did you see the
B	but em yeah it was quite quite banal
A	mm
B	but you know it was one  it was one of those  it was one of those kinda keynote speeches that makes you feel good about what you do and
A	mm
B	and eh
A	well good
B	feel like eh DFID is a good thing that eh
A	mm
B	yeah
A	whereabouts was it?
B	at on the
A	mm
B	that's where the careers fair was being held
A	right
B	mm
A	mm
B	oh I went to Mother
A	oh was it good?
B	mm
A	mm
B	every bit was as good as the National Theatre production I saw a couple of years ago
A	wow
B	mm
A	that's pretty good
B	em I think they used the same music
A	mm
B	em
A	was it just the ADC putting it on or was it a specific?
B	it was CUADC yeah
A	oh
B	so presumably you know they had a a good good budget being ADC
A	yeah
B	no
A	mm
B	it's got yeah there's quite a lot of comedy in it despite the fact that it is a tragedy
A	well that's the best sort
B	and you know her children die one by one in the end all of them
B	mm
A	yeah I did think about that actually what was
B	I came out  I came out  of the theatre in into like four inches at least of snow
A	mm
B	yeah
A	yes
B	I was going faster than a lot of the cars
A	yeah
B	Cos they were being a lot more careful
A	I've been cycling
B	glad to have a mountain bike not a
A	mm
B	not a road bike
A	mine's not great for snow
B	mm
A	I left it for Monday and Tuesday but then I ventured out again but was kinda going at you know one mile an hour over the icy bits
B	yeah
A	em it's only the the paths that are sort of covered in snow
B	yes
A	yeah
B	like
A	yeah
B	so
A	yeah
B	where I have to go along to get to the foot eh foot slash cycle bridge over
A	mm
B	that's that's pretty damn icy
A	that's the thing so normally
B	Cos it's had  it's had  two layers now and the first
A	yes
B	layer it had just kind of settled and sunk and been trodden in and driven on
A	mm
B	and melted and re frozen just enough to make it proper ice
A	yeah
B	and now it's had a dusting of snow on top as well
A	yeah normally I go down em I go down
B	yeah
A	but then you don't
B	yes
A	so normally I cycle down there and then there's like another back lane bit and it brings you right out down almost at
B	that takes you out just you know kind of towards the Co-op you know
B	yeah
A	I got gritted yesterday though at the bus stop
B	oh nice
A	A gritting lorry went past
B	the eh on January third
A	mm
B	my first Hep B shot
A	right
B	of the trio em it was raining em
A	mm
B	but I didn't have any trousers
A	right
B	so I was getting quite soaking and so I cycled across town to to the appointment blah blah blah had it did my ten minutes of waiting
A	mm
B	afterwards eh to make sure I didn't faint or anything
A	I did faint after I had the injections
B	did you? Oh
A	oh yeah
B	urgh
A	well she wasn't but it felt like that and seriously my arm came up oh no it was there wasn't it?
B	yeah
A	came up in a massive
B	yeah
A	and then
B	and I I I'd just about dried out by then
A	yeah
B	and kind of dried out and then I went out into the rain cycled well no I decided to walk back
A	why cos it was?
B	because then I've got my rain coat above me
A	and your legs
B	and my legs don't get completely and utterly sodden
A	right
B	and I think I was texting
A	mm
B	Cos I was gonna
A	right you weren't really
B	and I was walking on across
B	and just after I'd hung up two cars in sequence sprayed me completely
A	oh
B	and utterly wet
A	that's no fun
B	so I sent a text with a lot of swear words to my parents saying
A	to your parents?
B	you know what just happened? Cos I'd just  I'd just  hung up on them
A	right
B	em
A	did you see our snowman? Talking about getting drenched
B	yes
A	it was amazing
B	ah
A	he very quickly melted though
B	you need  You need  to see another snowman
A	we sort of built like between the two drives and our neighbour's daughter normally parks in the space next to our
B	oh
A	whose whose snowman is this then?
B	the Facebook  the Facebook  app on Android is so buggy and crap
A	yeah?
B	yeah
A	it's quite a significant bug
B	it's supposed to be getting
A	oh right
B	no
A	oh dear
B	orange no
A	yeah
B	it's marked as an Orange from San Francisco it's actually
A	right
B	ZTE is the company
A	okay
B	well it's good
A	mm
B	sadly
A	so he's yeah he's gonna get one exactly the same as his other one
B	mm
A	so it's the thing he's replacing it
B	it's just em
A	yeah
B	there we go
A	oh my god
B	A fifteen foot snowman
A	I've seen that before
B	I know
A	is she
A	is she friends with
B	what?
A	one of the guys who built that
B	em yes I think so
A	yeah
B	oh
A	so they probably do actually know each other don't they?
B	fair enough
A	that was a very very cool snowman
B	I know of someone who did a eh snow dalek
A	A snow dalek? That is really cool
B	I'm going to have to em check that out as well
A	there was really good
B	on Twitter which works a lot better
A	yes
B	sorry?
A	next to its snowman owner unless it was a stray dog there
B	just ran away
A	yeah
B	eh
A	I wonder when it's going to end? It was playing havoc with all the the bulbs and stuff
B	mm
A	oh I saw them yeah
B	which may or may not be alive
A	depends how hardy they are
B	I know nothing about horticulture
A	well my limited knowledge of daffodils and tulips is that they'll pretty much survive anything because my family kill plants and we have daffodils and tulips which come up every year regardless of anything
B	mm
A	so yeah I think they probably they they survived being dug up and replanted every year
B	now let's see
A	the snow dalek rather than the snow tardis
B	that's true
A	yeah
B	A
A	so what to make it bigger on the inside?
B	yeah
A	quite yeah fair enough quite tricky
B	yeah
A	impressive
B	it's got something there
A	yeah it has yeah
B	I'm not sure
A	it's a spoon is it a spoon?
B	mm
A	that's really good
B	mm
B	no
A	anyway what time is it? Is is it time for work? Oh not too bad
B	eh I need to clear out
A	well that's good
B	ow sod off
A	oh

B	the new ah the new research
A	right
B	no no
A	right
B	to become the eh what was it? The innovation hub
B	I don't know
A	or is it like?
B	they kind of go together in that sense because bursary is there for people to apply people or branches to apply for funding for
A	right
B	projects which might come out of their research projects
A	ah
B	that kind of thing
A	so it really makes sense to have that kind of
B	linked up
A	yeah fair enough
B	em yeah
A	so it's the innovations hub coordinator?
B	now that that
A	huh
B	I don't know
A	so there's joining there's there's people there's placements and bursaries and
