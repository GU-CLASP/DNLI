A	there we are that's er
B	you don't always pay for fuel
A	true
B	whereas you never refuel without me
A	true true
B	wow
A	what's very exciting?
B	they're rather imposing having three story houses at the end of this road you know
A	is it a little bit
B	two stories
A	two stories yeah
B	oh can you see the Coach house and if you look back down that way
A	oh
B	I think we should go in and look
A	it's an interesting design
B	it's got
A	ah
B	that one is actually might be quite steel
A	yeah that's much better
B	it's freehold
A	that is much better
B	you get a garage a parking space erm and you have five windows not three
A	oh that's better
B	so there's still no window into the hallway
A	what was the other?
B	and the kitchen
A	oh yeah
B	are you tempted?
B	we wouldn't want to move away from
A	ah
B	no
A	yeah
B	I don't clip a corner please
A	yeah
B	ugh
A	hmm
B	mm
A	do you think I should buy that iPod today?
B	yes
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	mm
A	erm I did that while I was out at bank
B	mm
A	erm and I think it's true
B	mm
A	warrantee cos it's not quite the same thing
B	well we know that
A	well er I mean I guess they've had to
B	yeah
A	they can't habitually break after a year any more
B	no
A	because you'd never
B	they never used to
A	I heard some bad stories
B	erm hang on
A	yeah
B	yes
A	erm which I mean possibly was there was more bits to break and more bits to overheat and
B	yes
A	I assume so
B	yeah
A	interesting to ask
B	I'm pretty sure it must be
A	it must be
B	because it stores
A	huh
B	well someone's keen
A	ha ha they look quite intrepid don't they?
B	yeah
A	going for a walk around the area
B	possibly
A	I know it's just if we're not particularly doing anything it's just a very kind of it's a way of doing a walk without much
B	but when are we not particularly doing something?
A	no true
B	if we ever become bored yes
A	ha yeah
B	actually I'll give
A	oh right oh is he
B	yeah
A	yeah true actually if he's sort of leaving anyway then er
B	yeah
A	was he gonna drive through though? So he has his car all through the night?
B	well he doesn't have a car so
A	I could have sworn Dan had a car
B	Cos his friend has a car?
A	no no I just
B	well he might do
A	no no maybe not
B	yes well
A	no car  Was he getting erm the bus out do you think?
B	I've no idea but
A	yes um he might choose to cycle but he's a long way from where he
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	actually I could look in another sports shop
A	yeah well Sports Direct is very close to John Louis
B	yeah
A	which does you know I know you'll hate being in there but it does brand stuff at non brand prices
B	yes but they also bought the Newcastle stadium
A	yeah we like that
B	it is quite funny
A	but they're just such an embarrassment to themselves
B	right erm
A	okay
B	just cos it's they might say it's only
A	fair enough
B	okay
A	oh
B	I said hold not drop
A	ha
B	okay
A	ah
B	yep
A	A bit too much
B	I look forward to tomorrow
A	yeah it should be fun
B	er it might be dry actually
A	erm yeah so
B	get stuff for lunch as well
A	get stuff for lunch
B	I like cheese and sweet apple
A	cheese is good yeah
B	mm
A	A few of each
B	oh yeah
A	and some apples? We could buy apples
B	yeah that's good and some crisps as well
A	we've got crisps so we don't need to buy those
B	oh yeah true
A	so
B	oh I've got a flask which is a canteen so
A	oh okay fair enough
B	which is what I'll be planning on using
A	Cos then we don't yeah we don't have very many bottles at all
B	well I've got two er more
A	okay fair enough yeah
B	which brings us to well over ten bottles
A	that should be fine yeah
B	er
A	erm my survival kit I've got my blanket whistle and compass yeah
B	blanket whistle and compass
A	next week one lunchtime I'm gonna go down and try and find something for Heather
B	oh for a birthday present
A	my dad suggested something
B	when's her birthday?
A	Wednesday when she's here
B	Wednesday circuits
A	circuits yeah
B	and Will a big shout out to the birthday girl
A	yep
B	we need to get her induction sorted
A	well I was wondering actually whether it would just make more sense to do it on Monday
B	well she can the induction weren't take very long
A	well I mean I don't think she'll particularly do you know what I mean? I don't think she'd really miss out on
B	okay
A	I don't think I mean you know if she just doesn't go on Sunday it's pointless just booking it for her
B	well we'll see when they can do it
A	yeah true
B	yeah
A	yeah no I mentioned this erm
B	this is really giving a bad impression of the world of work
A	it's pretty much what publishing is like
B	it's pretty much what your
A	well no in all fairness Bloomsberry was exactly the same
B	no
A	erm
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b loves snorkelling	Neutral
B	yeah?
A	and erm she actually got another job at CUP
B	yeah
A	but she was  she was  applying for jobs everywhere
B	yeah?
A	so that they
B	and that would be quite good hand in your notice before you start
A	yeah that's what she did
B	interestingly there erm that was an example of er safety overriding legality
A	yeah
B	but I in doing so I went over the speed limit
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a has two jobs	Neutral
A	right
B	erm cos I was breaking down in forth and I wanted to actively be in third so I don't want it clutched into third but the erm acceleration imparted there in took me slightly over the limit
A	mm but it was safer to do that
B	yes
A	and not do that
B	so if people perpetually ask but how can it be safe to brake how would you well how would you ever justify breaking the law in the interest of safety
A	well I'd just say it's a I was gonna say I'd er that's pretty straight forward I'd say to that
B	mm
A	um
[ANNOTATION]	that did not bring speaker b over the edge	Contradiction
B	oh right
A	which I was quite sad about
B	well if you wanted to work at Bloomsbury like  The easiest way for you to do it
A	come to work with you
B	oh
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a was very happy about it	Contradiction
A	sorry
B	yeah the problem is that there's no fast train
A	ah that is true
B	you'd go much quicker from
A	yeah
B	which I could detour by to
A	well no but it seems daft that you drop me off
B	well that's doable
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a thinks it's possible for speaker b to drop them off	Entailment
A	mm?
B	because going into
A	that's a nightmare that's not yeah
B	what you should do is er go and stay with my parents during the week
A	that'll be interesting yeah
B	er
A	well you'd have to leave so early that
B	well no it's just as bad as er
A	mm
B	well actually what you should do is learn to drive
A	well
B	get there earlier
A	I'm sure you could find somewhere to
B	well actually that would only get you to Kings Cross
A	across London
B	yep
A	from erm
B	where am I driving to?
A	the centre
B	Good right
A	yeah
B	er
A	I was gonna give my dad a quick ring as well and just see how my grandpa is
B	oh yes
A	erm
B	have you told him yet?
A	about the er nose thing?
B	yeah
A	I haven't no
B	that is a cool looking house
A	classic
B	they need to get some better cars
A	yeah
B	I can't believe those things are still road legal
A	ha ha yeah
B	they used to be cool flats
A	three belts I'm assuming
B	mm
A	busy isn't it
B	little bit yeah
A	I wonder if there's just some kind of hold up
B	just a bit to
A	well if this is the queue to get into the centre
B	yeah
A	is it? Oh
B	Cos it takes what ten minutes to walk from
A	if yeah if we're blocked up back to here then yeah
B	no er it's red actually
A	alright
B	yeah well that's just a pedestrian crossing
A	okay
B	just for sheer density of traffic
A	yeah
B	Cos even if they start
A	yeah no definitely
B	just after lunch
A	yeah fair enough
B	okay
A	yeah
B	that's what I'm thinking
A	I yeah I don't think you can get through
B	no you can't
A	just the yeah
B	yeah
A	we're not you know we're not
B	what about how much of a tit he is?
A	yeah well basically yeah
B	he was ever a national treasure?
A	um which is interesting
B	national embarrassment
A	well yeah
B	I love that fast into the city centre
A	yeah
B	what were you saying sorry?
A	um yeah so so it's an oral history project um for the British library and they're getting people to submit conversations on the website
B	mm
A	which is pretty interesting
B	do you get paid?
A	no
B	ooh
A	well yeah
B	it's promoting the profile of the
A	yeah it it's for just kind of preserving storage of the
B	this has took us we've literarily come ten yards
A	that's it isn't it
B	but I'm concerned about getting to
A	it should clear up a little bit now but that pedestrian crossing just
B	we'll go to the bank first  cos that will close
A	right
B	the pedestrian crossing is now on red
A	no
B	yes it does
B	I've had
A	possibly
B	I remember coming in
A	yeah
B	like four or five colleges
A	that's nice
B	that was a nice day
A	hmm
B	it is just
B	it'll be actually no I'm not good at pronunciation
A	erm
B	this is ridiculous
A	it is ridiculous
B	I'm also a little bit annoyed about how much of this traffic to the left is being let in
A	yeah
B	Cos it's
A	the yeah it's that's moving far faster than er
B	well admittedly there was less of it
A	yeah people are just letting them go
B	yes
A	they are a bit mental in
B	I think it's better however
A	so they yeah so they
B	so ten cars back and we would sort of hadn't cleared at all
A	mm
B	so mm yeah
A	yeah
B	right
A	mm
B	yep we're going down here
A	yeah
B	damn it
A	yes
B	yeah I'm actually um we'd have to thread right the way round into the centre
A	yeah
B	right
A	yeah basically
B	this is a twenty speed limit and you're not quite making it
A	okay so that was a little bit early for a signal there
B	that is a driving school car
A	mm
B	I'm sorry
A	Don't fancy playing football in this weather
B	yeah thought so
A	wow two buses
B	oh what a shock
A	so that's a very late bus
B	Jesus
A	what really annoys me
B	right
A	but I obey the laws
B	yeah
A	I don't just just go through red lights
B	yeah
A	and it's just massively annoying you know you they I I overtake them
B	yeah
A	two minutes time I overtake them again
B	okay well we'll take Anne's car park if it's quiet enough
A	yeah sure
B	they
A	mm
B	well I mean if had only been if I had only been twenty that would have been fine
A	haha well
B	is Anne's car park free or?
A	ooh it looks fairly busy actually erm
B	let's go to  then
A	yeah  might be your best bet er
B	yeah
A	it is crazy
B	there was a very interesting thing about priority there
A	what did you say?
B	I said there was a very interesting thing about priority at those um
A	I was looking at the erm thing I wasn't so what what happened? So you were turning right
B	hang on
A	oh it's leaving weekend
B	yes
A	that makes sense
B	okay so
A	okay so good erm
B	see if we can find a space
A	mm
B	damn it
A	haha nice try
B	that's perfect timing believe me as well
A	didn't think about that
B	ah
A	ah
B	where?
A	no you said ah
B	the road at the back of Anne's might do it
A	interesting
B	it's gonna be open
A	Cos not many people know about it
B	yeah but we don't wanna get blocked in there
A	no true
A	no but they would let you out
B	yeah but it excuse me sir what are you doing parked in there?
A	yeah
B	no that's not gonna work
A	well that explains the horrendous traffic anyway
B	what?
A	well it means in future we can predict it basically
B	well I did have one idea
A	I don't know what they're used for
B	think open
A	I assume they're not used for anything
B	yeah open
A	there's there's no no parking laws or anything
B	what?
B	oh
B	oh right
A	is there any along here?
B	no there weren't be
A	oh yeah
B	see the annoying thing is there used to be a good parking space
A	yeah
B	okay so where are we gonna go?
A	so we can either erm
B	just keep cruising
A	we could try the one in Newnham
B	I'm not confident
A	A trek yeah
[ANNOTATION]	there was a parking space before	Entailment
B	oh
A	yeah
B	I can try down there but I don't I'm not er
A	yeah
B	well alternative is we go out
[ANNOTATION]	it is easy to park now	Contradiction
A	I think yeah we can just park on one of the roads round here
B	did you understand where I meant?
A	so so down there
B	no you know where the footpath at the end of this road?
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	it is difficult to park a car	Entailment
B	that goes through into a housing estate
A	yeah
B	park in that housing estate
A	ah
B	yes
A	seems like a good idea yeah
B	I'm just gonna move forwards now cos there's some
A	no I and these people aren't gonna move them quickly as well
B	yep can do
A	erm so
B	ah
A	do you see what I mean? We could turn left and go just down one of those streets but it's hard
B	we might just have been able to get in there but that's probably pushing it
[ANNOTATION]	it is easy to get a parking space	Contradiction
A	do you know what I mean? Just a street
B	I'm not sure that we'd find any round there
A	mm
B	probably fairly
B	yeah
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	parking space is hard to find here	Entailment
B	yeah
A	I mean it might be a little bit
B	Christ this is crazy
A	it's insane isn't it? Huh
B	there's just one space in there
A	is there? Ah right
B	I think
[ANNOTATION]	there is one parking space	Neutral
A	haha
B	I've got a nagging feeling there might be just the one
A	oh
B	alright
A	and they're not you know it's a good weekend to park here cos they're not gonna be questioning the fact that there's cars everywhere
B	I fully intend to
A	yeah
B	ah sweet
A	that's good
