A	there we have it
B	it's gonna be five minutes while I do
A	oh well that's alright
B	and make tea
A	right
B	erm and it's sort of similar to
B	and
A	at least he found somewhere to go and er
B	yeah
A	bit of music
B	it was nice
A	yeah
B	we we did you know we had to pay again to get in but when we said well we'll get refunded on the
A	yeah
B	on the
A	yeah
B	it didn't matter or being rescheduled
B	and
A	right
B	erm and I sort of got a little picnic for trains
B	and all that sort of thing
[ANNOTATION]	it must be on a certain date	Contradiction
A	yeah
B	and erm
A	oh wow
B	I didn't know if they could make it and in the end about two minutes
A	yeah
B	before the doors closed
A	he was there and jumped on board
[ANNOTATION]	someone jumped on the board	Entailment
B	you know he he he jumped on board
A	yeah
A	oh good for you
B	you know it was
A	yeah
B	erm
A	and then you got this thing when you got down there it's like oh
B	yeah but we're not wasting all that effort
A	no god no
[ANNOTATION]	someone will come for tea	Neutral
B	I mean just just the logistics involved
A	it's the effort yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	time travelling you know?
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	they will make tea	Entailment
B	mm yeah it was bit of an investment so
A	yeah
B	so I'm glad that we did that cos that meant
A	so was the other guy good?
B	he was alright I was saying to
A	mm
B	actually his bass guitarist used to be in erm Suede apparently
[ANNOTATION]	the bass guitarist is famous	Neutral
A	wow
B	yeah
B	erm
B	which is fine
A	yeah
B	but it was very literal
A	right
B	and to give you an example of that so one of them was erm
B	isn't that a little bit teenage
B	a little under developed? cos he
B	and it it it we were we were
A	yeah
B	I mean am I being a bitch?
B	you know if I'm if I'm being that critical
B	I'm the same
A	cos it's shit
A	but it's part of my repertoire
B	yeah
A	it's the one of the ones I like to sing live
B	and and
A	cos I don't have to try too hard to remember the lyrics
B	it's it's just there
B	and not not all of them were that bad don't get me wrong
A	no
B	like erm
A	so it was hit and miss in terms of the tracks though?
B	little bit and also I
A	mm
B	someone like
A	yeah
B	and and er that sort of thing
A	oh gosh yeah
B	and you've got
A	mm
B	and
A	mm
B	erm because just the power behind them as as as well as his voice being
A	yeah
B	it's like
A	yeah
B	it's like I said to
A	yeah
B	and I actually realised that it wasn't appropriate for public consumption
B	it was
A	yeah
B	and that was it and that's where it stayed
A	yeah
B	not in a sort of British oh I'm I'm shy to express it
A	yeah
B	but actually because it was just
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	you know and it it just reminded me of that
A	yeah
B	so anyway
A	what was his name?
B	I've forgotten
[ANNOTATION]	person B can remember	Contradiction
B	I know
B	well I
A	right
B	he's not

A	they're showing you but I kinda like
[ANNOTATION]	person A like kinda	Entailment
B	I think so
A	the style she has cos that to me it feels
B	I erm I haven't heard much of it I I heard
A	which is quite unusual cos normally people go oh it's she's like nuh nuh nuh
B	yes
A	and like what you said yesterday was like a little female version of Damon Albarn you know? erm
B	Damien Rice
A	Damien Rice sorry
B	yeah

A	yeah
B	or you know Office
B	Microsoft yeah ever since I've ever touched a puter
A	yeah
B	so it's
A	yeah
B	erm

B	is it?
A	it feels like putting your right foot
B	uhu
A	it it it works
B	uhu
A	you can sort of get about
B	you can get about
A	obviously
A	like yeah
B	that's that's what I'm like at the moment with the Ipad
A	yeah
B	with some things cos I'm like now do I swipe it to the right?
A	mm
B	or squish it together you know that sort of flick
A	mm
B	that minimizes things but actually
A	yeah
B	closes them
B	and
B	has it actually closed it? or has it just gone from my view?
A	it's just gone to the background
B	but is still running in the background?
A	mm
B	it's like I'm a bit confused
A	mm
B	about all that
A	yeah I'm quite confused and
B	but erm
A	at the beginning I was I was swishing and doubling and you know opening out and closing it was all very kind of like you know erm?
B	touchy feely?
A	touchy feely like they you know erm Tom Cruise and the erm?
B	oh what is it erm?
B	yes I do
A	pre see like these murders and stuff?
B	yes
A	that that scene in the film I was like oh yeah

B	why wouldn't you just use your finger then?
A	I don't know
B	me yeah well look at mine it's filthy isn't it?
A	no

B	yeah
A	which I obviously
A	yeah you can
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	I I got one for my phone actually
A	but I still don't know now what's going on with the Ipad

B	mm
A	yeah
B	a weekend?
A	yeah
B	when did you go?
A	well er two thousand and five and we flew in erm just after Independence Day
B	mm
A	Independence Day might be
B	I don't know
A	can't
B	uhu
A	erm
B	uhu
A	it's just one of things that happened
B	uhu
A	we spent the weekend in Chennai it seemed
B	uhu
A	as far as I can tell not that I've been to many but
B	mm
A	it yeah it was alright
B	uhu
A	erm enjoying themselves but I remember sitting down and I remember thinking
B	oh
A	it's like oh no seriously no no no no no
B	mm
A	but you know that's just the way it is I guess
B	uhu
A	so
B	year erm
A	yeah
B	er very heavily traded for the
A	tortoises
B	for the erm pet trade
A	right
B	and erm
A	eh baby shush
B	they get protective when the
A	oh okay
B	the postman they go mental
A	right
B	and it takes a while to quieten them down even if you say
B	erm
A	yeah
B	when he first started his his issue was well who do I tell? cos if I
A	yeah
B	tell the authorities they're not gonna do anything
A	right
B	partly cos they're under resourced and partly cos they don't do
A	is there corruption involved too?
B	or they they
A	yeah
B	he wasn't ever really sure
A	mm
B	about that
A	yeah I suppose you can't be too sure yeah
B	no so you've gotta be careful
A	yeah
B	and erm can't
A	yeah
B	that sort of stuff you know
A	yeah
B	so
A	CITES?
B	CITES sorry so CITES erm is an acronym and it's C I T E S
A	oh
B	of flora and fauna
A	okay
B	but that's not in the bit that you say
A	right CITES
B	so it's not
A	yeah
B	it's not CITES off fu fu fu
B	erm
A	so who set that up CITES then? when did that get set up?
B	er seventy-six
A	oh
B	I remember that cos it's the year I was born
A	oh right
A	so that's really
B	that was when it was all sort of ratified and
A	yeah
B	and and became one of these things where
A	okay
B	erm it's not about
A	yeah
B	of leave the world alone
A	yeah
B	it's about accepting that people are gonna trade stuff
A	yeah
B	and you might as well try and control it
A	it is it having much of an effect?
B	mm no
A	no yeah
B	trouble is is that CITES has no teeth
A	yeah
B	right so there was a big hoo ha erm a couple of years ago about erm Japan
A	mm
B	wanting to still fish bluefin tuna
A	mm
B	and what can you say you know
A	mm
B	they go round and
A	oh okay
B	on on
A	mm
B	er documentation or recommendations or actions or anything like that that can come out of it
A	mm
B	and erm
A	mm
B	and of course Japan's got you know various erm
A	mm
B	and countries you know either opt out of voting
A	mm
B	so they abstain or they vote in favour so
A	no
B	erm
A	mm
B	and the trade in rhino horn going there
A	mm
B	a lot of the time aided and abetted by Thailand
A	mm
B	not Thailand per se the government its very self I don't mean that
A	mm
B	within both the government and customs etcetera
A	mm mm
B	corrupt as fuck basically
A	mm
B	and erm
A	and this is rhino horns going into
B	yes
A	from Thailand?
B	erm some of them are going through Thailand and some of them just going through Thai hands
A	okay
B	because some Thai
A	what do the Vietnamese do with it?
B	oh they grind it
A	right
B	and erm drink it
A	mm
B	sort of erm
B	East Asian medicine
A	right
B	is that the right word? it's something like that
A	mm
B	anyway
A	right okay
B	but people assume it is because it's a horn and therefore it's it's it's phallic
A	sort of fashionable
B	yeah
B	probably oh god is it four or five years ago now? you could easily track it back looking at the media
A	oh god
B	and the last few in Asia as well
A	jeez
B	there might be
A	mm
B	but they just become what conservationists call non viable
A	right
B	it's not the the the the
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	is the the way they measure it is erm if a species
A	jeez
B	so it doesn't mean they will be extinct within a hundred years
A	yeah
B	it means that the population that are left are gonna have inbreeding problems and
A	mm
B	discussing it sometimes
A	oh stop it as in stop stop the effort on on
B	yeah
A	resources towards the?
B	yeah
A	mm
B	erm
A	mm
B	ergo you
A	yeah
B	spending it all on
A	mm
B	ones that they can
A	mm
B	you know? cos someone has to make those funding decisions
A	yeah
B	yeah it's tricky though cos sort of morally you know people get
A	yeah
B	get really wound up obviously
A	mm
B	and spreadsheets and stuff
A	mm
B	so anyway
A	mm
B	there we are cheery stuff
A	oh no I'm
B	well
A	right
B	both legal and illegal aspects of it
A	right
B	now
B	to put it mildly in looking at well the illegal trade
A	mm
B	and
A	mm
B	to individual authorities
A	mm
B	to say you know these guys are are not playing
A	mm
B	now if they're dealing with someone
A	mm
B	they can get in touch with authorities
A	yeah
B	and say look out for this
A	yeah
B	this this plane or something it's you know it's snakes on a plane
B	that sort of a thing
A	yeah
B	and and sometimes something gets done about it
A	yeah
B	erm so there was a big big erm
A	oh good
B	but then he was released
A	oh
B	and in the meantime his wife was allowed to
B	erm
A	yeah right
B	so but what's ridiculous is that the people who give out the licences for the pet shops the they're an authority called PERHILITAN which is the wildlife police essentially in Malaysia
A	okay
B	erm
A	oh dear
B	erm
A	oh god
B	and she allowed all this to continue
A	yeah
B	she was
A	yeah
B	lovely smiley
A	I bet
B	you know and oh you know
A	she's hardened as hard as nails
B	yeah
A	and quite evil to go with it
B	yeah
A	underneath I can imagine
B	first of all she was saying erm all these excuses kept coming up to start it was like oh I'm sure doctor
B	you know and I would I would use language like that
A	yeah
B	and sort of you know
A	yeah just railroad her
B	absolutely
A	yeah
B	and in the end she couldn't do very much because we'd gone and got erm a letter of support from the Minister of the Environment from Malaysia we'd we'd been and met him
A	mm
B	and all this and this is
A	yeah
B	erm
A	right
B	which is all you know government funds and all like that
A	oh right
B	so we had all that behind us it it it added some sort of kudos if you like
A	yeah
B	and we could say
A	yeah
B	because even though you don't give a shit about wildlife I'm very sure you do give a shit about the
A	about saving face
B	the British government's
A	yeah
B	yeah opinion of you
A	yeah
B	so that was
A	no
B	that's there
A	right right next to the bundle of
B	mm
A	this is what it's actually all about
B	absolutely
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	oh god
B	erm
B	I know
A	ready to
B	I I just had to I had to persevere through all of that and just think right well it is still happening it's still happening
A	yeah least it's going ahead
B	yeah
A	just not quite as you know
B	no
A	cos you'd imagined
B	no
A	right
B	at fake erm crime scenes so we were sort of setting up the poaching crime scenes and stuff like that and teaching them
B	people like
A	yeah
B	actually it's temperature a lot of the time
A	right
B	things like that and here's you know real tiger skin and here's some fakes
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Crime scenes are very real in movies.	Contradiction
B	and stuff like that
A	yeah
B	from various seizures and things
A	yeah yeah
B	so they get some sort of
B	yeah and
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	It's not easy to fake a seizure.	Neutral
B	some basic information about CITES and
A	yeah
B	all sorts of stuff
A	yeah
B	from three different countries
[ANNOTATION]	CITES counts many members currently.	Neutral
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	and then so I just said oh really well that's very unfortunate erm but don't worry we'll find an alternative and it'll still go ahead
A	yeah
B	I'll be in touch thank you for your time
A	yeah
B	you know? left
A	so you knew from the start that she was trying to
B	I
A	get you off course
B	yeah absolutely
A	you were waiting
B	and then at the
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B will be back for a matter.	Entailment
B	and I just said to people I'm so sorry there was a bus and it's been cancelled
A	yeah
B	you know so
[ANNOTATION]	The flight was cancelled.	Contradiction
A	it's out of my control
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	but this is in my control I can still get you to the venue
B	yeah I will get you there you just have to go
A	if you just bear with us
[ANNOTATION]	The place where speakers have to go is far away.	Neutral
B	soz man
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	and they're ever so nice at least
A	yeah
B	to your face I mean who knows what's said behind your back but
B	they were there because they wanted training and they were interested and a lot of them cared about animals it's just
A	right
B	yeah they already know full well about her
A	I guess
B	mm
A	that that that's quite par for the course in a way
B	mm
A	though that's sorry thing to say but you know?
B	mm
A	people are saying one thing and doing something completely different
B	mm
A	behind your back yeah
B	I know
A	gor it's a fascinating world isn't it?
B	mm
A	I'm just it's amazing to me that you know something like erm
B	mm
A	finding out that one official claims that he you know
B	mm
A	or whatever
B	cures cancer
A	yeah
B	mm
A	and that that just changes the whole
B	mm
A	dynamic and the whole
B	well it's actually gonna change the landscape of Africa
A	yeah
B	literally
A	it's just it's it yeah
B	yeah
A	but
B	the ramifications
A	yeah
B	are quite large
A	yeah
B	and I don't know if we
A	yeah
B	I'm I'm not
A	yeah
B	and they're grazing
A	yeah
B	erm
A	yeah
B	then affects what else can grow which then affects what else can
A	oh god yeah I mean climate and everything I mean you know? god yeah that's massive
B	yeah
A	and then you think about the human geography too
B	mm
A	suppose in terms of the
B	well the trouble is is that we just come along and just sort of
A	well that's true
B	the sad truth is is that in a lot of Africa at the moment there's erm
A	mm
B	they're called parks they're called reserves or whatever
A	mm
B	but they're
A	they'd be a pen
B	fucking pens
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	is there much education to the people who go
B	mm
A	suppose there isn't is there? there's no real way of doing that
B	it's really difficult cos what d'you do? you say listen I've done a randomised controlled trial
B	all Western stylie
A	yeah
B	and they turn round and say
A	yeah
B	claims
A	this is Eastern medicine
B	this you don't this is you don't understand
A	yeah
B	or that's at least what the propaganda would say
A	well this is why is said erm I mean my friend kept saying oh go
B	no you don't know what's in it
B	mm
A	I'm just like na
B	mm
A	there's no way of bloody knowing what's in it
B	mm
A	can tell you anything that's in it
B	yeah
A	and if it's got anything in it that I definitely don't like you know
B	mm
A	kind of ground down rhino or a shark fin or anything like that I'm like
B	mm
A	no way am I gonna ingest that
A	that's just not on
B	I know
A	mm
B	that this probably doesn't work and even if it did
A	and it's incredibly expensive
B	a little bit
A	and it's
B	well that that's another issue this is where it actually gets all tied in
A	yeah
B	because erm
A	mm mm mm true
B	erm
A	yeah
B	it's a very bourgeois thing to have
A	they're more affluent
B	erm and there's very much
A	snobbery
B	of of interest
A	yeah
B	yeah in status symbols
A	yeah
B	of all sorts
A	yeah
B	so whereas it used to be you know tiger skin on the wall
A	yeah
B	now it's for the youngsters it's going out getting pissed and being able to have rhino horn as a hangover cure
A	yeah
B	and or buy it for your grandma
B	for cancer yeah
A	yeah
B	it's a cure all and that's the trouble with some things that are wondrous
A	yeah
B	allegedly
A	yeah
B	and also how d'you educate the whole country? with without a concerted government effort
A	no you can't
B	you know especially in a what's essentially still a erm
A	yeah
B	you know
A	mm
B	there's erm
A	oh yeah? yeah
B	is that is that that's not
A	can't remember the name of the charity but I remember thinking that was a good erm
B	mm
A	yeah
B	really all they do it's demand
A	yeah
B	reduction
A	yeah
B	and and there's there's loads of different ways that we know from both social scientists and economists about how to sort of encourage demand reduction and education is one of them
B	but you know offering alternatives is another
A	yeah
B	all sorts of stuff
A	yeah and then they're like
B	you know? and it's like mm
A	yeah
B	which animals in general
B	don't know how but it is it is getting better apparently
A	yeah
B	no especially with in places like China where they they're just hoovering everything you could almost draw a map of
A	mm
B	sort of being hoovered up into China you wouldn't be far wrong
A	mm
B	there there's also some other stuff going on
A	mm
B	you know with countries being hubs and things like that and and end destination countries as well as source countries you know sort of
A	yeah
B	having their stuff taken
A	yeah yeah
B	erm
A	yeah which doesn't really look like it's dropping off in any big hurry
B	no absolutely not so you know
A	god how d'you keep
B	I don't know
A	solve this?
B	I
A	yeah yeah
B	I definitely went through a phase when I sort of thought well what am I what am I doing this for?
A	I'll bring that with us is that alright?
B	yeah sure yeah
A	cool
B	erm
A	yeah
B	if you're getting more and more despondent almost
A	yeah
B	you know? and then I just thought well
A	mm
B	right at least it's an you're making an effort as it were
A	are they up there?
B	erm
B	erm
B	I know
B	no?
A	too cold for you
B	being employed to do something
A	yes
B	that I care about you know and and
A	exactly
B	mm
A	in the thing that
B	yeah
A	then other things don't get built
B	on those people that can
A	so
B	exactly
A	it's a then there
B	yeah
A	are gaping holes where
B	mm
A	doing something somewhere
B	yeah
A	but it does seem very difficult to keep
B	mm
A	that
B	yeah
A	alive
B	mm
A	and they kind of you know they have this
B	mm
A	we just have a lot you know? moving kind of erm
B	mm
A	pretty much so
B	uhu
A	at least you can go okay I'm kind of you know
B	yeah it it is a production line
B	and
A	yeah
B	and what happens to them while they're no it
A	but I should start focusing now on the on the on the employees and the university
B	mm
A	cos I think
B	this is exactly what
A	you need to you need to you need to look at go alongside the organisations I mean
B	yeah
A	the students are only gonna get what's coming to them
B	mm
B	mm
A	as if it's healthy or not
B	mm
A	if the organisation isn't healthy
B	yeah
A	you know in terms of their you know personal growth
B	yeah
A	I think quite a lot of the time we we make
B	mm
A	really thinking caring enough about their employees
B	mm
A	and this is
B	absolutely
A	particularly now academics I'm focusing on
B	mm
A	I'm really
B	mm
A	particularly if you're under the age of fifty
B	yeah you think?
A	I think so
B	what d'you think that's because the age?
A	think unions contracts pressures there's so many different variables but
A	when I talk to people like yourself and I've got people in Australia I talk to and I hope to branch out a little bit more and find more of these people to talk to
B	mm
A	you know?
B	you you don't
A	how
B	at at at busy places that's the thing
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	but that's an organisational structural problem
B	mm
A	it's not unfixable
B	no
A	you you can
B	but where's the incentive to do it?
A	well this is why
B	yeah
A	I'm gonna pipe up and say something
B	mm
A	and I'm gonna say look
B	mm
A	a para academic in the sense that I go
B	mm
A	I mean helping out the academics
B	mm
A	I have a professional contract yet I've got academic qualifications that consist into the academics teaching side
B	mm
B	mm
A	but the problem is
B	mm
A	and I actually had to build my own network within the faculty
B	uhu
A	and across boundaries where traditionally a person like me would never get to work with an academic
B	mm
A	let alone do any research
B	mm
A	a person like me would
B	mm
A	be seen as an administrator
B	mm
A	go away and do something over there
B	mm
A	or take care of students or whatever it is that you do
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	so it's actually shaping around this thing called the third space
B	uhu
A	which erm an academic in London
A	was talking a bit
B	mm
A	who are academics
B	mm
A	do need a bit of assistance
B	mm
A	and there can be people like myself who can be useful erm
B	mm
A	you know
B	okay that's cool
A	yeah
B	mm
A	so I've got the head of department of where I was working
B	uhu
A	I was seconded into it
B	uhu
A	and I've asked her if she'd be interviewed for this paper
B	okay
A	cos I don't wanna slag off the management
B	mm
A	without knowing what their perspective is
B	mm
A	well you've gotta be careful too and that's what I was talking to him about on Sunday right I was going what's the ethics behind this what is our ethical framework here?
B	mm
A	we're doing action research but
B	mm
A	what are
B	mm
B	don't wanna lose my job
B	I don't wanna be seen as a whistle blower just for having an honest chat
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	well there's that that's the thing you know
B	mm
A	but erm
B	oh
A	well if you're writing a paper
B	erm well
A	mm
B	that are people they're gonna know the purpose of the research and that
A	yeah
B	erm
A	yeah
B	erm
A	yeah
B	erm
A	so you'll go
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	and so
A	d'you mind if I have a coffee? is that alright?
B	yeah no go for it
A	thank you
B	I'll er
A	put that on
B	yeah there's well there's a there's a I dunno what is it there's the
A	yeah
B	erm and then there's a sort of sub committee of that
A	yeah
B	within specialisations
A	yeah
B	so we've got a FREP which is the Forensics
A	right
B	Research Ethics Panel
A	yeah
B	erm
A	so what kind of academics feed in? is that a voluntary position if you're actually working
B	so
B	erm
A	yeah
B	cos if I'm thinking about research ideas I don't want to get so far down the line
A	yeah
B	some ethics issue that I never hadn't foreseen or whatever
A	yeah
B	erm
A	non caffeine's fine for me thanks
B	yeah
A	oh yeah non caffeine whatever
A	like yeah
B	that's two
A	mm
B	it's
B	and I won't do you a whole tablespoon we've run out of teaspoons
A	mm
B	so I speak
A	yeah
B	making it suitable for the intended audience
A	yeah
B	so is it for academics or is it gonna be published in an academic place? but you're hoping it's actually gonna come to the attention of a policy maker
A	yeah
B	who wants really clear
A	okay
B	you know very
A	yeah
B	very clearly in the summary and conclusion
A	yeah
B	rather than ethics but it's
A	yeah
B	sort of an overlap there
A	yeah
B	about acknowledging where their work was good or what it has been good for
A	mm
B	and why it might
A	uhu
B	or have been proven
A	mm
B	slightly wrong or whatever
A	uhu
B	erm
A	d'you actually find that much though when you're reading? academic erm journal articles?
B	mm
A	yeah
A	right
B	and a and a very simple
A	thank you
B	they would definitely win prizes for the campaign for for real English
A	right
B	you know so a campaign
A	yeah
B	for plain English is it?
A	plain English yeah
B	with with that diamond symbol
A	yeah
B	erm because you know
A	thank you
B	a a paper would start out by saying
A	ta
B	an estimated blah blah blah million
A	yeah
B	you know insurance was erm
A	thank you
B	it was costing the police which is therefore costing the public
A	yeah
B	you know this much money or whatever
A	yeah
B	erm
A	okay
B	by the manufacturers
A	uhu
B	one thing that they did that was done was that a car theft index
A	yeah
B	erm was published
A	okay
B	so that people knew which were the most risky cars to be
A	uhu
B	erm to own
A	yeah
B	therefore insurance became an issue
A	uhu
B	erm or sorry the insurance industries got involved
A	mm
B	therefore there was an incentive for the manufacturers to internalise which is an economic term
A	right
B	for taking on the costs
A	okay
B	of adding things like immobilisers central locking
A	yeah
B	all that sort of stuff
A	yeah
B	erm this paper erm tells the story of the development of that index
A	okay
B	and and that's your abstract
A	yeah
B	you know?
A	yeah
B	and and so it's not at all erm erm
A	yeah
B	it's
A	yeah
B	it is
A	it is like what it is like yeah
B	yeah this this was the problem
A	uhu
B	and this is what this paper's gonna talk about
A	yeah
B	and you just think right okay I'm totally on board with that
A	mm
B	I
A	yeah
B	I don't have to sort of search
A	yeah
B	out whether or not it's relevant or whether or not it's
A	yeah
B	so I just needed a publication to keep my career going or whatever
A	yeah
B	so I I do find that within that erm
A	yeah
B	erm
A	mm
B	extent because you're often talking about
A	mm
B	you know?
A	mm
B	and that always starts with a literature review which says this is what's been done in the past
A	mm
B	erm
A	it is systematic isn't it yeah?
B	it it it it should've been at at least
A	yeah
B	literature review erm
A	yeah
B	if it's in a a highly ranked journal
A	mm
B	otherwise it wouldn't be accepted
A	mm
B	so you say this is what's gone before
A	uhu
B	therefore the gap in knowledge is here
A	uhu
B	this paper therefore
A	addresses that
B	addresses part of that gap
A	yeah
B	by blah blah blah
A	right
B	experiment you know
A	yeah
B	and then it goes on to the experiment and the results
A	yeah
B	and again you you know it might be a slightly longwinded way of saying it
A	yeah
B	and B it very quickly captures you up on a whole
A	right
B	if you read the literature review
A	yeah
B	erm so you know where they are
A	so that's very different from
B	uhu
A	you know as a social science and is it even
B	mm
A	is it a science? is it
B	a process
A	yeah it's
B	mm
A	it's come from very different origins you know
B	mm
A	education and and I I find that quite a lot it's that's why where the ambiguity lies
B	okay
A	which I think is why my
B	mm
A	about four different paradigms that can exist you know for in education I think
B	mm
A	I don't sit there and go I'm a teacher and I have a constructivist point you know paradigm position you know I don't
B	mm
A	I don't think like that
B	no
A	what constitutes
B	mm
A	of education and
B	mm
B	mm
A	think of a few and they're very much involved in policy
B	uhu
A	you know they were addressing it when
B	mm
A	erm and of course they have public debates as well about it you know with it being a public you know good in the sense of education but
B	mm
A	but I'm not
B	uhu
A	but still the
B	okay
A	yeah I'm not anonymous
B	mm
A	I could be
B	uhu
A	but that means then I don't
A	yeah
B	mm
A	and that's the thing I'm really trying to figure out at the moment is is it really about being a participant in the study? or is it actually about being a named author
B	mm
A	and it is part of a growing
B	mm
A	so you turned up for work each day and you had some frustrating
B	uhu
A	critical would be alright
B	uhu
A	but what am I actually criticising? you know I could be just
B	well
A	mm
B	so can you come up with a list of recurring
A	uhu
B	questions
A	uhu
B	all any
A	uhu
B	you almost want to come up with a list
A	uhu
B	and say you know this kept happening
A	yeah
B	erm
A	and give a and give a
B	and
A	yeah
B	blah blah blah
A	yeah
B	erm
A	yeah it's a good idea
B	observations
A	yeah
B	that's what you start with
A	yeah
B	and then you can discuss
A	yeah
B	erm
A	mm
B	to that bit
A	mm
B	and that's actually why further research is necessary
A	uhu
B	and actually more participants are needed
A	uhu
B	and more action research is needed
A	uhu
B	and that would lead on naturally to the recommendation that
A	yeah
B	in essence
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	you know?
A	yeah
B	and
A	yeah
B	of why this role
A	yeah
B	and further research into it
A	yeah
B	erm
A	yeah
B	the start
A	yeah
B	you always need to you always need to write your
A	yeah
B	at at least have them sketched in your head
A	yeah
B	and and then you tailor the paper so that you logically argue up
A	yeah
B	up to that conclusion
A	yeah
B	and you might have ten other
A	mm
B	but you save them
A	mm
B	and that's that's the skill
B	I think in good academic writing
A	yeah
B	a clear paper
A	one
B	to to deal with it thoroughly
A	main argument
B	and okay you
A	yeah
B	you know in in other articles and whatever
A	yeah
B	so people can't say oh you didn't think of this
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b talks about an article	Entailment
B	say well actually I did and if you read it I did actually
A	yeah yeah
B	you know?
B	and and obviously there's an element of that
B	erm
A	yeah
B	really clear on your purpose
A	yeah
B	what
A	yeah
B	you want out of it
[ANNOTATION]	they don't think it's clear enough	Contradiction
A	yeah
B	you know so first of all its intended audience and
A	uhu
B	purpose of your paper
A	uhu
B	is it policy makers? d'you wanna
A	uhu
B	d'you wanna
A	uhu
[ANNOTATION]	they want to write a paper about sea creatures	Neutral
B	people like you essentially?
A	uhu
B	uhu
A	you think this type of research would fit into quite nicely
B	uhu
A	you can work backwards then in
B	yeah
A	terms of look at what
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	they are not doing any kind of research for the paper	Contradiction
A	you can look at the styles
A	you can look at what's
B	yeah
A	just gone before the year before so don't cover that because they're probably not gonna
B	mm
A	interesting to the editors or whoever
B	well no there would be if it was a logical progression from that
[ANNOTATION]	there are different possible styles	Entailment
A	true
B	yeah
A	so I was thinking well you know do you target erm? definitely have a look at those ones? or d'you go you know into an area that say that might actually be
B	mm
A	of this type of research that's coming through?
B	mm
A	or maybe have a two-pronged effect
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a is not asking any question	Contradiction
B	yeah
A	a a wildcard kind of
A	yeah
B	and your simple policy oriented to the point one
A	yeah
B	as almost a letter
A	yeah
B	to a a
A	yeah
B	or something
A	yeah
B	or a
A	yeah
B	or something?
A	yeah
B	you know research notes
A	yeah
B	or something
A	yeah
B	can you get a
A	yeah
B	you know is is there that sort of practitioner policy maker erm
A	there is there's the higher education academy
B	right
A	commission small you know small erm pieces of research I mean that's commission
B	uhu
A	but yeah inside there
B	yeah
A	erm
B	the poor
A	they're
B	the poor buggers who've gotta keep on top of all of this
A	yeah
B	research
A	exactly
B	to then come up with relevant
A	yeah
B	and up to date policy
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	cos I found one paper that's just
B	mm
A	and how that feeds into
B	mm
A	overarching organisational strategies of the universities and blah blah blah
B	mm
A	so
B	uhu
A	and practitioners
B	mm
A	erm
B	mm
A	and saying
B	uhu
A	that feeds directly into what you're saying that you didn't get from your research
B	uhu
A	cos they only had an eight percent respondent
B	right
A	a response rate on their surveys
A	and they're clearly saying what they need more of
B	yeah
A	they need more models and case studies
B	uhu
A	so I was thinking
B	uhu
A	and say what kind of
B	mm
A	and maybe they have some ideas about how to be a bit more
B	maybe but I also be careful
A	mm
B	it it
A	yeah
B	then we're going to this journal
A	yeah
B	when actually they've done bugger all work
A	yeah
B	and
A	yeah
B	and all that stuff so
A	yeah
B	if you want that to if that bothers you
A	yeah
B	that's something to keep an eye on
A	mm
B	trust people and stuff
A	yeah
B	but
A	I know I'm just well aware that that doesn't really happen very much yeah
B	no
A	yeah
B	have to have that conversation?
A	yeah
B	but it's it's true so
A	yeah
B	I talk about these people about my research
A	yeah exactly
B	ah
A	it's just
A	yeah
B	so do you take a leap of faith and trust in it?
A	yeah
B	or
A	yeah
B	and in them I mean
A	yeah
B	but also I don't know if you come across as a little bit erm
A	mm well
B	okay
A	you know I'm not an academic
B	okay
A	so I'm not tasked with you know? right I wanna see you know three or four publications per year in your in your field you know?
B	yeah
A	well yeah both of us haven't got
B	like by just contacting them
A	we haven't
B	uhu
A	his his
B	oh okay right
A	and and and other stuff
B	yeah
A	you know stuff to do with the aviation sort of industries
B	yeah
A	mm
B	erm
A	uhu
B	cos he's good friends erm of his from his childhood and everything and erm
A	yeah
B	okay
A	time to meet
B	it's almost one up from meet the parents
A	yeah
B	you know it really was it was like okay this this is important
B	erm but anyway so
A	uhu
B	erm
A	uhu
B	cos he's actually erm
A	yeah
B	stuff like that
A	yeah
B	and erm
A	yeah
B	about who's more sort of active about this as well
A	yeah
B	I think
A	that would be good
B	so
A	I I do need to start networking out and
B	yeah
A	locally in
B	and and that that's a start
A	yeah
B	there you've got a
A	yeah
B	you know
A	got in
B	er yeah got one potential in
A	yeah
B	of of someone who I think is is well connected
A	yeah
B	I think he's run for councillor a couple of times and stuff so as well as his
A	right okay
B	being a teacher side
A	yeah
B	and his sort of you know
A	yeah
B	in all sorts of aspects of of life
A	yeah
B	he's he's gonna be well connected
A	yeah
B	because of
A	yeah
B	I don't know
A	yeah
B	you may fundamentally disagree with his politics and everything
A	yeah
B	and I'm not entirely sure myself but
A	yeah
B	you know
A	yeah
B	so
A	yeah well that's true erm you know because that is another that's another area in terms of
B	networking is important isn't it?
A	you know
B	so start with friends
A	yeah
B	who can
A	but it's also being unaware
B	yeah who knows what else is already happening
A	that might happen in secondary
B	well like I say
A	yeah
B	whatever yesterday
A	yeah she's just
B	she's feeling is high is high on
A	yeah
B	painkillers cos her back's
A	yeah
A	oh god
B	you know back totally totally gone
A	is she gonna see someone?
B	yeah she's been to the doctor and she's referred to a specialist
A	right
B	and and you know waiting for all that to kick in
A	yeah
B	so
A	yeah another time definitely
B	talk to her about her job at one of the colleges
A	yeah
B	erm
A	yeah
B	that that sort
A	yeah well that's kind of my position
B	and all
A	learning advisor
B	yeah absolutely
A	yeah
B	so she would be if she was at a different school she was saying her
A	yeah
B	and probably deputy head
A	yeah
B	that she's that
A	yeah
B	that level
A	yeah
B	so very very useful and
A	yeah
B	again for authorities and probably magazines and stuff
A	yeah
B	that professionals and practitioners
A	do read
B	read
A	uhu
B	have a chat to a few people I would say friendly people
A	uhu
B	who are mates of mates in
A	yeah
B	probably before you contact those professors
A	yes
B	erm or whoever they are
A	yeah
B	who did that publication
A	yeah
B	erm
A	yeah you're right
B	uhu
A	they're probably just gonna keep on trying to get as much funding as possible
B	mm
A	to conduct that type of research so in a way now when you were thinking be careful
B	mm
A	I was thinking they might actually see somebody like myself as a kinda like well does she fit in with our thing or is she actually
B	yeah it
A	as well?
B	I know so so it could go either
A	yeah
B	way because they actually need a research assistant d'you want a job?
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	cynical
A	yeah
B	but
A	yeah but normally they have their in crowd of research assistants of pools of people that they
B	probably but maybe not
B	maybe maybe they've made these observations and don't know how to take it much further
A	well also yeah depends on whether their peers
B	mm
A	didn't quite hit the mark in terms of what you set out to do you know? because they've put limitations down about
B	mm
A	you know why the people didn't respond to the survey and
B	right
A	sorts of things but erm quite frankly I don't sort of really accept that I
B	mm
A	think that should've been thought through much much more there's so much they should share on
B	better better research design
A	and then it's
B	yeah
A	staring you in the face if you know anything
B	yeah
A	about you know
B	exactly
A	working at university
B	yeah
A	the students and the staff you know
B	yeah
A	so I trying to
A	yeah
B	you know?
A	no they they structured it as a survey and then they asked at the end if you'd like to be
B	uhu
A	so self selection
B	uhu
A	or so you know?
B	uhu
A	and and then not a lot of people did
B	mm
A	and then not a lot of people turned up on the day for the focus groups
B	yeah well they wouldn't've had time
A	yeah
B	I'm not surprised
A	yeah
B	I I don't go to talks and things that interest me let alone someone's research that I'm sort of doing as a favour
A	yeah
B	you know er you just don't
A	yeah you just don't have the time
B	it's
A	yeah
B	and actually that's definitely something to put in your paper
A	yeah
B	to participate in this sort of research so that it can be done
A	yeah
B	to come
A	yeah
B	up with action points
A	very true
B	it's it's it's isn't it yeah?
A	that's a really good recommendation
B	mm
A	cos it is action research
B	mm
A	and that in its framework really does require
B	participation
A	to fully participate you know
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	the other way I was looking at it as well was like maybe
B	mm
A	so somebody who said to oh who was it
B	uhu
A	he said no no I wouldn't worry about it
B	yeah
A	you just go ahead and write your paper and is aid why is that and he goes
B	yeah
A	you can just write in you know
B	mm
A	or any
B	exactly
