A	yeah yeah
B	so even though the whole recruitment selection thing is nothing to do with me the way they did it
A	no it's not yeah
B	for that particular role was nuts
A	yeah yeah
B	they gave made them do a logic test this is media assistant jobs it's like
A	what?
B	twenty to twenty-four grand or something
A	which section is this?
B	an LTS that's in your it used to be my section I used to be in charge of that section and then they get erm production managers in to streamline everything as the beginning of all this enhancing capabilities centralising everything this was the start
A	bullshit bullshit bullshit bullshit
B	bullshit bullshit bullshit so anyway part of it was as part of their application they had to do you know you've seen the application form it was that plus a logic test which half the people working in-house failed
A	yeah
B	got all these teams working in-house as media assistants
A	yeah
B	they all failed it so that's pissed off half the people involved
A	was it a lateral thinking or logic logic test as in?
B	I don't know
A	not quite sure right okay
B	I would have failed it probably
A	somebody obviously thought I know I'm going to be really erm
B	oh they brought the consultants in
B	yeah
A	you know something like thinking fast thinking slow I think that's like can't remember that's erm
B	well that was the beginning and then as well as that they had these three questions one of which was if you were organising a music festival how would you do it? my friend
A	yeah so she knows exactly how to do it
B	I've just seen this amazing job at the
A	and she still doesn't get the bloody erm job
B	well she got an interview
A	yeah thank you
B	where they were given another logic test to make sure they hadn't cheated on the first one
A	that sounds exactly like what my brother does when he is trying to erm recruit but you know I rang up that guy rang me up which is really nice actually
B	oh yeah god you were telling me about that so what did he say?
A	so he if you come across
B	very closed
A	it's just had such the opposite so I was being all flowery and colourful with all my like you know I thought I was trying to it's a communications officer job so I thought I'd be a little bit more on the side of meet the brief but do it in quite a
B	this is what I suggested he did
A	and he said look after quite a lot of pulling and of teeth a bit on this one and then he sort of warmed up to me a bit and then he's like no okay right what we just really need to do is just list that criteria bullet point list bullet point list bullet point I said yeah that's fine if you come from a really communications background
B	really?
A	he actually then he changed his mind it wasn't but I'm the learning advisor I'm now applying for a communications officer job if you're trying to change career as long as it's a title based thing
B	yeah
A	you've got to really work it you've got to try to really give some explanation he well that didn't actually work in your favour you've gotta do it the way we want you to do it and he goes if you ever want me to check one of your he was nice actually he goes in the end he goes if you ever want me to check one of your
B	well there's
A	yeah
B	but then the recent interviews have been shit
A	he did okay he
B	because the other thing they asked supposed to be a competency based interview but one of the questions they asked them was there's a stopwatch you've got five minutes a tidal wave is coming you're by the sea
A	oh for god's sake
B	what are you gonna do? inevitably
A	this is all this lateral thinking testing
B	what a load of bullshit we don't want people who can save people from bloody tidal waves we want people who can follow fucking instructions and setting code course materials
A	yeah exactly
B	how misleading
A	it's more for the interviewers to have a bit of a laugh like did you really say that? like you know she was faced with a tidal wave but she'd just crap herself you know what would you you know to be honest with you you'd just
C	well the answer the answer is is one of those questions the answer is not
A	yeah yeah
C	they're not looking for the content of the answer they're looking for how you deal with the question
B	yeah exactly
C	so people
A	not but then I think that people get actually like you you probably just wouldn't go ah er you'd probably go okay let me think about this I'll think about it and then people actually start accepting that as quite normalised it's like okay let me think about this if I were to actually be looking at a massive and then if you do get the wrong answer because people have got preconceived ideas of what they would actually answer so if yours is
B	well
A	yeah but what I'd say is good
B	and I'm like actually you probably answered that
A	yes though that's bollocks you know my understanding of a tidal wave is is you've got no time to think anyway so
C	yeah well you would say that a tidal wave would never be that big actually a tsunami maybe but not a tidal wave
[ANNOTATION]	Person C is talking about the differences between tsunami and wave	Entailment
A	but it does make you
B	well there was the one because some groups said tidal wave other groups said tsunami cos there were like three different panels
C	okay
A	right and it makes you try to look like you're cleverer than you're not
B	mm
A	like in a way they're trying to say you know out-clever me
C	yeah yeah
A	see if you can cos it's not possible because I know actually I'm clever far cleverer than you so you're really being pitted against their sense of themselves
C	yeah
A	which is in interview it's not fair
C	yeah
A	it isn't
B	the whole thing's not fair and the thing is they've been sent a thing saying it's a competency based interview
[ANNOTATION]	Person B is going to dance	Contradiction
A	actually I feel like I probably got away with you know cos what you were telling me about
B	well that's LTS though IET are not part of LTS
A	oh I bet you anything they're next
B	well we actually thought that we were gonna be become part of erm under the refocusing
A	yeah
B	and that hasn't happened yet I suspect in three years' time my
[ANNOTATION]	Person B think that it might happened in three next years	Entailment
A	but do you know what I really like the idea about working for
B	yep
A	no other reason
B	mm
A	but you work there as an associate lecturer or as a tutor blah blah blah blah blah you're gonna get all this scot frigging free
B	yeah the NBS is like ridiculous
A	right so I'm I'm looking at that I'm looking going that is one of the reasons why
B	yeah
A	they're pretty generous you've gotta work for it they're not gonna hand it to you on a plate but my god you could save yourself a shitload of money
[ANNOTATION]	Person A think they are so kind	Entailment
B	yep
A	which is what you're doing you know
B	it's what I'm doing
A	so you can see but like in the end the bloke was really the guy I was talking to today was going in a round about way he was saying if you don't find the level of expertise here as a supervisor you you might wanna consider looking for expertise somewhere else
B	yeah they've gotta believe no wonder their open days are crap
C	well are they that's kinda good though isn't it? because
A	oh I like this guy you know he was on my side in that sense
[ANNOTATION]	Person A is not sure but if that guy were in his side ,he is his favorite	Neutral
C	because that that goes against the grain of like the whole education system
A	yeah yeah
C	because things are just sales you know and
A	yep
C	market based aren't they?
B	yeah they're not students they're customers
A	mm mm
C	erm so like so you know somebody actually looking out for the the education of their prospective
A	mm mm no
C	yeah
A	he never would have said
C	yeah
A	cos he just basically explained he's got you you you just have to find someone to be committed to them for about five hundred years of your life you know what I mean involved ever
B	it's a long time
A	if you genuinely don't have an interest shared common interest with this person and explain to me how this supervisor erm thing goes terribly wrong is that it lands on their desk they feel obligated because they're under pressure as an academic to get the money coming in as in supervising a PhD candidate
B	yeah yeah
A	they say no too many times big black mark
B	mm
A	you you don't get promotions based on that so you have to kind of do it but then you're doing it because you have to kind of do it and that poor person genuinely thinks that that research that they're doing is original that it's going to make a big difference to everyone er like even someone not even just you know just somebody else like it might make a difference but it isn't cos that supervisor's just basically going don't care not interested couldn't give a shit actually I'm gonna give you minimal supervisory er you've paid shit loads of money
B	well I didn't realise how lucky I was with my masters supervisor
A	mm
B	he was so patient he was actually a Quaker which probably helped but he had the patience of a saint
A	mm patience yeah
B	he he gave me like I I'd go for bloody months without sending him anything
A	mm
B	almost years in fact
A	mm
A	yeah
B	and he was still really positive and
A	and
B	I can't remember I'd have to show it to you it was it was that thick
A	do you know what I wrote for my masters? five thousand words
C	is that all?
A	can you believe it?
B	really? no way
A	and they asked me to write no this is honestly
B	that's brilliant I might do one of those next
A	do you know what they've asked me to write about? choose a top down sorry a top down management approach erm in a in a in an education setting of your choice it's non-negotiable right okay fine and then argue the case from a scientific paradigm a constructivist paradigm an interpretist's paradigm and a critical erm theoretical researcher's paradigm and I went what the fuck does that mean?
B	yeah
A	you know like we haven't even
B	that would probably take me four years to work out what that meant actually
A	what does it matter? and it and that and that
C	yeah
A	you couldn't give a shit about what I think you just want me to think like you
C	mm
A	in five thousand words and do you know what? it was so babyish it was like task one two hundred words task two three hundred words this is post graduate
B	that's unbelievable
A	and they think that people who like me who have just written five thousand words can then go on to do a doctorate degree okay it's not a PhD but it's got doctorate in it it's a higher degree
B	mm
A	how are people meant to make that jump exactly? I put my question up I went my
C	mm
A	to a doctorate in education but why would you say that because it's not
A	he was actually really mellow he didn't have that edge on him which was like
B	wait till I've got a job here and then that's paid for cos otherwise
B	mm
A	one male and he left at lunchtime
B	welcome to my world
C	you mean the staff or
A	er staff no that's fine that was quite representative it was like a balance
C	okay yeah yeah
B	oh no cos they were senior academics they were mostly male but then all the lower levels were chicks and then that's the weird thing it's like all the chicks and yet all the seniors are guys it's like how does this work?
A	but it was like but this is education this is academia this is you know this is just trying to get on and do something a little bit you know I was thinking a fair bit of men might be knocking around going I'd quite like to do a doctorate degree in blah blah blah but then I remembered
B	nah it's all chicks
A	education
B	chicks
A	but then when you look at academics as in the pure breed of that meaning of the word
B	mm
A	but that's a healthy mix you know I don't know you know
B	yeah usually but education is generally more female
A	mm mm
B	but still that is incredible there's only one
A	mm one
B	wow
A	mm pretty bad
C	mm
A	I dunno maybe it was just an off day
B	well bad weather
A	yeah it well yes
B	was the football on or something?
A	well I don't know it might have been
A	but how are you enjoying your course?
C	yeah I mean going you know I'm certainly enjoying it
A	mm
C	like I cruise through life to get like one essay we do every six weeks
A	mm
A	oh that's a lot
C	it's like not major projects obviously but like just a consistency they were
A	yeah it's like boom boom cha cha cha yeah
C	yeah erm so it's like I felt with that like I like to really get to get to grips with something and I feel like that's not
A	yeah
C	if you really want to display your understanding very well and really read a book on the essay
A	yeah yeah
C	erm
A	but the good thing for you I think is where students have really your peers would be like if I call them that for want of a better word but erm what I've noticed cos I did a lot of you know erm help on erm
C	mm
A	back to and fro blah blah blah probably gonna do alright as long as you don't get too clever
C	mm
A	whereas people who've got no
C	mm mm
A	they just actually think it's all descriptive writing blah blah blah blah blah and whatever and they will fail because of that erm so I think as long as you I don't know prob probably said but I think that what I learnt to do was just just stick to things like my argument is my rationale my my and then they don't they'll actually just pass you whether you actually read that book or not I know that's in a way it's kidding yourself because you actually really wanna read that book but you're really kidding them because all you really wanna do is kid them right now because you can always read that book in your spare time
C	yeah true
A	and you don't actually have to prove anything
C	yeah
B	right decision time
A	yeah
B	shall I cook or do we do we want to go out?
C	I think we should go out let's go out
B	you wanna go out?
C	is that alright?
B	yeah
A	mm
B	I wanna go out we do have a ridiculous amount of food in the house but that's okay maybe we can freeze some of it
C	let's go out do some
A	you wanna go out yeah cool alright so do you do you me to
C	huh?
A	do you want me to drive?
B	no don't be silly
C	it's only a walk round the corner
A	mm
C	how
B	you're you're probably over the limit
B	to be fair we've had like two and a half
A	well I haven't been knocking it back too much cos I wasn't too sure what the situation was but
C	I imagine that's mostly
B	it wasn't entirely
A	no no no no we've been like like
B	it wasn't just me
A	well alright so we just walk around the corner then
B	it's
A	okay
B	is it still raining? we can get a cab back
A	mm
C	mm
A	I know that sounds awful but they don't actually care and that's what I had to accept was okay so they don't actually care they couldn't give a shit erm so might be one you might really write really well for because you you think that they've actually shown an interest in you because you've shown an interest in them you know how that relationship works like
C	yeah
A	no I really like your stuff oh then I'll like your stuff and then
C	mm
A	as a
C	yeah
A	they used to have just to give you an insight into this they used to have erm competitions with each other and first year particularly about how quickly they could mark an essay
A	and one of them went I did it in three minutes
B	who did this?
A	these are academics
B	jesus three minutes
A	who are who are who are good academics like
B	they've
A	on pieces of paper you go
B	I'd always give them at least twenty
A	but exactly but they compete they try to out compete I mean all of them I mean a lot of them are actually really like slogging it hard trying to give you feedback but actually kind of not the point either really what you have to do is condense your feedback and give it back to them really succinctly so you can't give people too much to think about it just worries them and so it's a balance but they they when I was doing some research into this about evaluation of metaphors into evaluation and education which was the last thing I was doing I gave them like little cards which is the evaluation is a production line evaluation is and evaluation is in terms of students' performance or academic achievement or learning progress they could interpret it if they liked it's amazing how many of these metaphors were coming up which were more to do with marketing more to do with accountability and these weren't even people who have actually a marketing background or any kind of accounting they've just been bombarded with it from every day discourse
B	mm
A	management speak and you have to think like this you have to do like that so they're actually beginning to think like these people
C	mm
A	when they're actually never ever really you know started out that way so it was like so I was trying to make a connect to what their previous studies would have been or their previous industry experience so so evaluation in your previous job what was it have it evaluation in your job now what is it? got to do a little Venn diagram and then ones that met in the middle it was really really interesting but it didn't really matter what they put where it's what they said that counted
C	mm
A	so I recorded all that and I looked back at it and I was like
B	well I think
A	there is a self loathing about it cos they they didn't like
B	yeah yeah yeah cos they're
A	the pictorial graphics on this one when they saw their diagram yeah
B	some of the
A	yeah
B	but now like so many other things like music or whatever you're not just expected to do this you're supposed to promote it and get students in
A	yep
B	and you're supposed to be everything to everybody
A	yeah
B	and they can't handle it they just can't handle it
A	yeah and I don't think I could either I actually know my limitations and I think
B	oh project manager
A	yeah yeah
B	the
A	you know if you climb from lecturer to senior lecturer you could do the career path blah blah blah you know if you were really to go and get that PhD you know just get yourself in with somewhere you cos you've got the teaching bit you won't have to worry about it so much because most of the academics have got research degrees but no teaching qualifications it's like that's really hard
B	mm
A	you have to do like about sixty percent of your job is teaching but you've got no idea
B	despite the business scores crashing and burning at the moment they've got these really dare I say it
B	nerdy guys who've studied finance and they're trying to make them teach
B	they have to
A	they're really anxious because
B	yeah
A	when you're just researching on your own or collaborating you can kind of hide and you can sort of make make things kind of happen in the background cos you actually get somebody else to do a lot of the work but with teaching you're absolutely there people are judging you evaluating you that
C	mm
A	behind the well non-existent whiteboard because now it's a screen and you have to look beautiful and you have to do this and you have to prepare that
B	and then put your notes on moodle afterwards even though you might not have actually done it on any notes in the first place
A	yeah yeah so you might have prepared a brilliant lecture with a guest speaker thrown in for good measure and a little bit of exercise as I used to do a lecture in critical thinking where some people would say would you come into my lecture and do twenty minutes of it? just to boost the
B	oh god those were the most traumatic lectures that's what put me off being a lecturer was critical thinking
A	yeah
B	Richard fucking Dawkins the Selfish Gene man
A	yes
B	that was traumatic that was so traumatic
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	as
A	mm
B	he almost redeemed himself when he was gonna take on the pope and then he chickened out
A	yeah
B	and I was like you're just a
B	but yeah the Selfish Gene  critical thinking
A	yeah yeah
B	awful horrible
C	yeah but the the problem with that is I'm sure you'll happily disagree but like the problem with that
C	it's not it's not Richard Dawkins it's the structure of learning
B	it's the students that's what all the academics say to me it's the students
A	it's always the student's fault than the other way round
C	although students have come but they seem to come through this it's made that task alien alien to them or they they picked up
B	well that's what we're attempting to teach
A	but
B	ironically enough and with Dawkins
A	yeah
B	it's the fact that if you do dare I say it look at the selfish dean don't buy a copy cos he'll get some money from it
A	yeah
B	but there's like at least two if not
A	no
B	but he's such a persuasive writer he's just such a good as a rhetoritative I can't even say the word
A	yeah yeah exactly it's the rhetoric yeah yeah it's the rhetoric yeah
B	that you read it and you just believe especially if you're a first year med student you read it and you go wow this is amazing
A	yeah I remember because I I was lucky cos I had erm a job where I had students coming to me and asking me really great questions about how do I write an essay? how do I do referencing? and every single person's question was different and I answered it differently so every individual's got a slightly different take on things so that's brilliant and then when I was having to work with academics trying to imbed academic literacy
B	yeah
B	every guy that I worked with
A	yeah
B	complete rubbish
A	you know like the erm like a castle like a medieval castle it was like the drawbridge yeah or all the
B	yeah
A	so students aren't gonna be interested in you because you've already before you've even set foot in the lecture theatre you've already really made yourself non-accessible you may be brilliant in your mind but your mind isn't working effectively because it isn't actually flowing outwards it's just keeping itself within and students will go on Facebook but I tell you I've seen the difference when somebody fucking says something in a really interesting way you know mobiles get put away laptops get put down and people go
C	mm mm
A	but then through their first year they realise they're not actually being excited on most occasions
B	I can still remember how disappointing the lectures were
A	and then they get into a mindset is that university is actually quite boring and then your second year and your third year is kind of really tainted by that so first year lecturers have to be brilliant
C	mm mm
A	but they actually put the shit ones in the first years and then leave the ones the with the it's the reverse it should be people who have a broad church of perspectives not just in their discipline they can go you're doing a degree in okay I can see how why this might be important for you but you can say that to five hundred people you can say that to one person I always say to lecturers whatever you're saying and thinking you can say to five hundred people you can say to five you don't need people clamouring for your attention you don't have to have them around you to feel like you can give them something give them something from the start I mean you'll know all this you
C	but do you think?
A	it's like kind of a big poo but they can't
C	but do you do do you think like it's largely the the erm how do you describe it? so like the traditional teaching methods or like the the that give people that inhibition about actually expressing their themselves in their their their subject in a way that really relates because we go through this huge processes of like you know er school not not being very fun and formal curriculums having to be conveyed and so on and so forth so so by the time that you probably become a lecturer you you've gone through your own education yourself and you've picked up
A	mm
C	information is conveyed
A	mm mm mm mm mm mm I think that's very interesting what you're saying I'm sure that's a large part of it I don't know much about it
B	see I
A	but I think that's really interesting what you've asked yeah
B	I can actually remember how boring the lectures were when I was eighteen
A	yeah
B	because I'm a visual person and I remember noises and I've learnt that over the years but the problem with studying by distance is you're just reading all this shit over and over
A	yeah
B	and I don't remember a computer screen
A	yeah
B	I mean do you find if you have an interesting lecture do you remember it or does it just blend into another lecture?
C	erm
B	cos the few interesting ones I had I used to be able to
B	I can remember this
B	and she kept going on for weeks about this bloke called bloody Arthur this and Arthur that she used to handwrite it overhead projector things in those days
A	yeah which is
A	there's something so personal about it though
B	I'm hungover I can't see what she's writing and I can't ask her
A	it was
B	you know I'd get home and I'd be like Arthur let's have a date
A	yeah whatever
B	and there was only like when I finally she finally typed something up and gave us a course erm description and that was like king fucking Arthur was in medieval British history
B	I mean for all these
A	Arthur Arthur where the fuck is Arthur?
C	so you so you were you supposed to be in that
B	yeah it was nine o'clock on a Thursday morning and I was hungover as hell always I was like it was the one day I didn't have science because I was doing a medical intermediate because my parents wanted me to be a doctor so all the other days I was doing biology and chemistry which I hated and
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about job	Neutral
B	didn't really remember anything of but history was like yeah I wanna do history so I get up and go
A	yeah
B	and I'd sit there going how can she make something that should be so interesting be so boring?
A	so dull yep
B	Arthur Arthur and then she oh who was the other bloke? there was some other really important bloke she'd been talking about for weeks
A	but what about your lecturers at the moment like do you find does anything what we're talking about kind of represent how it's coming across to you or?
C	er er yes certainly what you're saying about like erm the difference an engaging speaker can make so I mean erm in one of my lectures we're doing the geographies of the body
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about lectures	Entailment
B	oh is that all the French feminists?
C	no there's definitely there's definitely yeah
B	oh what was the name? what was the name? I was really trying to do a Margaret Atwell book analysis
A	no I don't know anything about this what is what is geography of the body?
C	so it's this idea that so er it's about
A	okay I've been getting into a bit of yoga recently I think I can go with that yeah okay yeah
C	erm so so in terms of say like so we were we were being we were talking about erm the way bodies are viewed in are viewed in certain contexts so the beach or the er you know
A	mm mm
C	er girls' school in the nineteen sixties
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about girls school	Entailment
A	mm mm
C	and how these you know erm it's probably formed as probably part of human geography I think it's part of human geography
A	yeah
C	erm er it's all a bit wishy-washy and conceptual to be honest but er erm
A	do you like wishy-washy conceptual stuff though? or do you prefer it to be a bit bit more grounded?
C	erm
A	cos each learner's different so
C	I certainly no I like mm
A	yeah
C	cos I'm very political very
A	yeah
C	kind of can concretely I can concretely take away and think ah so that means something because I see it in the real world or
A	yeah
C	it enlightens me about a particular event or something erm
A	yeah yeah and I I can get that and you know what I don't think you're alone in that
C	mm mm
A	and then once I've understood how my eyes work and er how they may not work so there's some
[ANNOTATION]	person A is not sure about how eyes work	Neutral
C	mm mm mm
A	you know but that's not really how we work we really work the opposite we learn the opposite which is everyone else has thought about it
C	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about party	Contradiction
A	we've kind of already worked it out for you so we've done the working out and all we're gonna do is tell you the bits that we think
C	you found are interesting yeah
A	you know might
C	yeah
A	or at least gives you curiosity about it so we really really come from a different mechanism of learning and I think that's really important to bear in mind that when you're looking at your lecturers and you're going how the fuck have they actually chosen to give that example but not an alternative example? which you might actually have
B	but that's a mature student thing most first year students will sit there
[ANNOTATION]	person B is talking about first year student	Entailment
A	it is but but
B	they just wanna listen they wanna be entertained
A	but that's why
B	they're there cos they paid for it they haven't really thought it through
A	but they but they they hog the the limelight and that really annoys me cos I've actually had to say to mature students
C	we hog the limelight do we?
A	just no not you but I'm just saying you know if you get a reputation as a hogger
C	yeah
A	it pisses everyone else off
B	I used to dread mature students
A	yeah
B	I I knew them all by first name erm
A	you've you've really gotta give you've gotta give somebody else a chance
B	we had over a thousand students we had twelve hundred students
A	yeah
B	and I knew all the mature students by first name
A	right there you go
B	and I used to actually in some cases I hate to say it though well
A	yeah
B	I mean what can you do?
A	but then if you're if you're a mature student you're a mature student right I could see how this could work where the other people have been looking at you going okay rather than you being and kind of coming across to them you're not a know it all but you come across not you not specifically but it could be that people who actually really were quite well read
C	mm mm
A	really very literate very interested in what they're interested in very knowledgable and already started to implement some of their ideas
C	mm
A	you'll meet them you'll you'll you know who they are
C	yeah
A	so I guess like the way to do it is like you don't want to alienate them and you don't want to alienate the lecturer cos the lecturer'll go oh fuck here we've got you know so and so probably knows more than me and they hate that bit you know it's like not that you really do but you do know quite a lot so it could be that you might come across as slightly challenging that's okay I don't think there's anything wrong with it but for the other people who don't understand what the challenge is it's an argument isn't it? but you know what I was saying to you during about earlier is that some people don't know what an argument is
C	yeah
A	so what I was saying what they think you're being
B	but they don't and that's back to critical thinking isn't it?
A	so I could see why one thing I do you know what I really like about it?
A	asking a lecturer for everyone's sake is what are the misconceptions about this? so you're not actually saying I know what they are people who go what does he mean about misconception? that forces the lecturer to think you're actually just asking it from a flipside rather than going please validate what I already know cos I kind of like already know but I want you to further extend my understanding
C	mm mm
A	but you can't cos you're in a lecture if you were in a one on one be plenty
C	yeah
A	but I've often found I said to my first year students whether they were mature students or first year students put your hand up when you're really genuinely confused okay or genuinely excited anything that's going on within you in terms of like you feel something put your hand up in a right kind of breath of you know pause and just say but what are the
C	yeah okay I'll give that a shot when I'm er
A	well no I just you know I don't know it's just another way of doing things
B	if you get really bored at least you can
C	it's it's definitely there's definitely gotta be a way to spice things up a bit more cos I've done the I've done the smartarse thing in lectures and then yeah
A	and how did that go down?
C	we yeah no you just feel a bit awkward afterwards
A	yeah you do
C	cos I'm
A	this is gonna blow everyone's minds yeah
C	okay then yeah
A	yeah if I give you my honest answer it's like his intellectual approach of his answer
C	yeah
A	but I do think that erm enquiring and just flipping everything around that you can just like going not that you're hiding your bushel you know you're not saying you don't know anything you definitely do but at least you can engage other people in
C	yeah
A	because somebody might go no I disagree with you
C	mm mm
A	all the time and you can play devil's advocate I mean like play you know but you could actually skilfully
C	mm
A	I think you'll get really bored I've seen people like you come through and go this is dull and I'm like but the subject isn't dull yeah no but the people are
C	well pretty much everything I write about in essays is books I've read anyway so almost yeah
A	well that's a great start and I think that I think that will
B	see I didn't get that into like my post graduate year and even that was stuff I could
A	oh my god this guy's read a book not just the first paragraph and plagiarised it
A	I mean we are looking at some awful I mean practice in terms of academic practice from students but then I won't go on about the
B	I live in fear of being done for plagiarism because
A	yeah me too
B	one of the problems with
A	mm
B	and how can you do that
A	yeah yeah
B	at least you know he's throwing in the whole bloody books he's
A	well then he has a legitimate right to do it you're on you're on shaky ground
B	I'm on real shaky ground like my last TMA I was actually because I handed it in at one and a half minutes to twelve so I'm already in the
A	yeah
B	yeah it's like right at the last minute
A	yeah
B	and then of course I got it back last and everyone else has got theirs back already and they were like oh yeah so so hard and done okay and I was like actually I was just thinking back because they're so short you can say fuck all and
A	yeah
B	it's harder for me doing the short stuff than the long stuff
A	oh me too like a
A	ah ha
B	and because that's the only place that you're allowed to get the information is the book or the website cos it's the business school
A	yeah
B	luckily for me they do still have books hallelujah I can write all over them and take them on the bus and
B	should see the state of them
A	oh instead of like caress them
B	yeah books yay but I was so paranoid by when I hadn't heard for an extra week I was sure I was sure I was gonna be done for plagiarism cos one guy who'd done quite badly in the exam and he'd done well in the assignments cos we had a really good study group for the previous module he got looked into for three months and I was so embarrassed
A	are they watching him from the start? okay
B	well I think the thing was because he'd done so badly in the exam compared with the assignments and he'd obviously done well in the assignments because we had a really good study group so we'd all get there and talk like I got seventy in one of my corporate finance
A	right brilliant yeah
B	you know I was
A	cos you all work really well together
B	yeah and they gave me the answers but I did actually sit there for a day for each question
A	yeah
B	I took five days off work for the last TMA and I would spend a day on each question and try and work it out for myself
A	yeah
B	because I knew that was really important to do the exam
A	yeah
B	and if you've got five days you can do that
A	yeah yeah that's true
B	but when you've got forty-five minutes per question
A	it's not gonna happen
B	you can't do that
B	anyway this poor bloke
B	they really really fucked him round and in the end they finally said oh well actually what it was we put your second TMA through this I can't remember the name of the software
A	like turn in or some sort of plagiarism checkers yeah
B	there were two paragraphs
A	which is total bullshit
B	he basically paraphrased from the book his English is a second language he's from Bangladesh or somewhere
A	yeah
B	and he hadn't put a an
A	yeah and it can be sometimes it can be just you're on a deadline and you just literally mistake it is a mistake you know
C	yeah
A	it happens we're we're bloody humans anyway shall we go for something to?
