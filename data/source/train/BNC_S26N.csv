A	well that was but it it's the shortest lighthouse in the country but it's the highest lighthouse in the country because
B	mm
A	it's right on top of the highest cliff
C	right okay so the cliff gives it its height
A	the cliff gives it its height and the lighthouse is the shortest one so
B	but it's

B	yeah
C	but er I went and watched a football game the other week after school our year elevens playing
A	yeah
C	and I and there was only a couple of kids I recognised I didn't I couldn't recognise any of them
A	no

B	yeah
C	so
A	that's a bit weird innit?
C	yeah
A	that's rain?
B	yeah
A	you got your linen out haven't you?

C	or I can put em on the computer put the on the puter
B	because you tend to go ah
C	oh yeah
B	there's a lot a lot we've got to delete
A	a lot we've got to get rid of yeah
B	yeah and er cos funnily enough each little cove was slightly different although mainly the rocks are all the same colour and that erm they were slightly different weren't they? in how they how they react and stuff yeah
A	and er I think in one of the coves we went to
C	all the big rocks?
A	big rocks
C	yeah
A	they got to the top of the cliff and tipped all these rocks down and they were a totally different colour to the normal rocks
B	oh like like concrete bits you know just
A	yeah
B	that's that's so silly I mean there's so many rocks there anyway
A	you'd have thought they'd have used those
B	why to have something different
A	tipped all these other ones down
B	it wasn't too much was there but?
A	no but that
B	it was obvious
A	that looked looked stupid
B	you know mm

C	yeah
A	and the smugglers they used to smuggle stuff in didn't they?
