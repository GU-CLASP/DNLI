B	I don't know I get
E	how does it
D	yeah from cos I spent I spent like my extra money I had left like two hundred pounds or something
B	oh

B	yeah because like the government don't give me any money do they? well they give me three thousand five hundred that I pay
E	how much?
B	three thousand five hundred
E	so your accommodation
B	accommodation and living that's gonna be that's it that's all I get like I was like oh my god I'm gonna need four and a half grand
D	yeah three thousand
B	so even without mum and dad's help I'm a grand and a half over so I said mum I need to get an overdraft cos I can't live and so she were like well if you get one you're on your own like we paid six hundred pounds a month for you to live in Leeds we're not paying it any more if you get an overdraft
D	well I had like
B	they just don't want me to get one they don't want me to be in debt and I was like well

B	I I don't know why I just manage to live but I don't know how I do it one thousand pound a term I don't know how I do it
C	but
B	she doesn't get much help off her parents but I get the feeling that her parents could pay if they wanted to they're like I think the government have given her a loan like me
C	yeah
B	expecting her parents because of their income to pay it and they've not it isn't right really cos
C	it doesn't help the situation by buying buying more shoes

E	the hallucination ones are real good
D	there were a woman erm I'll be watching that like police programme in the morning while and there were an older woman like called the police out saying there was like a group of a hundred youths up and down the street like causing trouble and she was convinced like hundred percent convinced that there's been three sat in her chairs and she was like there's this fat man he was sat there and there'd been no one in the house
C	oh my god
D	but she was convinced like hundred percent convinced that there were all these people in her house and I was like I can't imagine like thinking that something's there like
C	yeah
D	genuinely believing it when it's not there
C	well my grandad was schizophrenic I didn't know him but he was so it proper scared me cos obviously if I'd been drug taking or anything like that I've got such

B	I need to when I
A	yeah I do they say with weed though it like
unknown_female	yeah

A	yeah
B	gotta do
A	yeah
D	that's why erm
unknown_female	yeah
A	okay
B	she's a lesbian I was like best
D	it was
A	what?

D	yeah
E	you know what? my friend came back from Ibiza and she had
B	oh I get
unknown_female	oh yeah
C	do you remember that
unknown_female	yeah yeah
B	and
D	it's
D	I've never had it like all through my life
D	are you sure?
A	yeah I'm just putting foundation on
D	I had it yeah I had it erm er a while ago now it was before the
D	where the boiler cupboard thing is in in the middle of the ground floor that's where the toilet was on our flat and so
unknown_female	yeah yeah
B	you can't move your eyes are open yeah
B	mm you can't move
D	I was trying to shout
D	no cos I couldn't shout
B	you can't move your mouth either it's like you're paralysed
D	and then and then I woke my er yeah my eyes yeah my eyes
A	horrible
D	were shut like and then all of a sudden I just woke up and I were like and I woke
unknown_female	yeah
D	I were like oh my god I'm like
B	I get that once a week I get at least once a week
B	I'm a massive sleepwalker though that's my
D	I had it that once and never had it again
B	yeah I do that I sleepwalk I sleeptalk like I stayed in a room with my brother in Tenerife and at the end of it he couldn't wait to go home cos I was doing his head in cos I was screaming my head off in the middle of the night
D	erm I well I did my friend
B	yeah
D	and she erm she had it and I didn't really understand what it was
A	yeah
D	I still don't get it it's so weird
B	it's horrible your body your mind's awake your body's asleep
D	yeah
B	but like when you you know it cos you can feel it like my heart would race cos you try and wake yourself up so like I'll hear ringing in my ears and my body's screaming at me to wake up
D	yeah
B	you're not breathing
B	yeah and a lot of people if if it goes undiagnosed
E	why
B	because you stop basically when you feel all that like euphoria it's cos you're not breathing so I lay there like not breathing for like a minute
D	it's stress and it's like but extreme exhaustion
B	after like love I would just
D	that makes sense that must be why a lot of younger people get it though
B	well literally I was lying there and I was in the flat on my own and I had the lights on cos I know I can't sleep with the light on so every time I drifted off like that and it would happen I'd wake up and
B	I have
D	I can't believe that like I had it that once and that were a bit of an
D	like that's not as bad as what some people had but it was awful like just my mind was awake but my body was like
B	you can see everything
D	like my eyes were shut but I don't know
D	I don't know if my eyes were shut or open or not
B	you can't feel your
D	but I could feel like I could actually feel the bed sinking down and looking in
B	it is horrible but it makes you not want to sleep like that night I'm knackered after my
D	she always has it where cos it's always like there's a monster in the room
B	not a monster
D	get back
B	I have people in my room but I'm I'm really calm with it like I have people in my bed like I'll be awake my eyes'll be open and I think lack of oxygen to my brain I'll see them walking around my room like I've seen someone
D	oh my god
B	stood at the end of my
D	oh I remember you saying
B	but it was her
D	maybe you are actually
B	maybe I don't know but I'm I am really calm with it I know
D	yeah see I really panicked cos I've never had it before
B	yeah
D	and it really panicked me because I thought it were like a big man like getting on oh my oh yeah
B	you just get I dunno my
D	yeah cos she
B	if it was an actual burglar I'd be fucked cos I'd just accept them
B	like I'd just I'd
B	I'd
D	and I just I like I thought I can't just leave it I will tell
B	yeah
B	it is it's quite dangerous if you chopped your head off it stopped didn't happen in
D	are you sure cos I don't I've been I've
B	I watched embarrassing bodies on it cos it came on one night and I was like oh I'd better watch this and see what's going on but apparently it's literally like it's a lack of oxygen if you lie on your back but I found when I prop myself up it still happens a lot
D	so cos I think the moment
B	yeah and when I wake up my heart is racing it's absolutely racing my heart is pumping out of my chest when I wake up and I'm sweating
D	yeah I did when I had it that one time
B	cos if your body didn't do that you would die because your body's doing that to say shit wake up wake up wake up and then
D	yeah
B	weird isn't it?
D	I were more panicky
E	yeah but
D	I know
B	everyone's going like oh
D	I can't breathe I get it all the time
B	yeah I do yeah
D	I can't imagine like er cos that once and I were really worried then cos I thought I hope
B	it's
D	I don't know how you can do it in like just like
B	yeah
D	just like I had
B	yeah I've got a massive mirror in my bedroom
