D	so
A	thing is er I I was like unsure as to whether like to acknowledge it or not
A	I did acknowledge it because er

D	yeah
A	can I sign in as you on my Xbox randomly? or do you have to actually type in passwords and stuff?

A	I

A	if you want we can try and
D	er it's probably worth doing yeah I'll let you do that and I'll just chill a bit here
A	you'll let me try and take the Wraith?
A	you need two people to do it
D	nah I have faith
A	no honestly
A	you need two people to do it you'll
D	nah
A	do you want me to go for the Wraith now?
D	yeah screw it
A	so you need someone to board it and you just have to punch the er thing off and then whilst they're grabbed hold it
D	yeah you you hitch on yeah
A	you you yeah yeah hitch on there
unknown_female	holy moly
A	me censoring myself is weird
A	oh here's the Wraith
D	yeah there it is
unknown_female	just gotta wait for it to
D	ow
A	oh
D	two
A	well that's great
D	two shots it just KO'd me in mid-air
A	I was busy looking up at the sky
D	killed by Grunts how do you feel?
A	I know
unknown_female	mm
unknown_female	is one of them a fuel rod gun?
D	dunno
A	there's a grenade down there I might've just killed you
D	yeah

A	I just wanna lob
unknown_female	wanna get them all
D	oh dead
A	you died? already?
D	yeah
A	you can run over here and you can spawn
D	hooray
A	alright now you just seem to have run off now
A	that invisible wall though the Wraith I can't wait to get
D	oh
A	a Wraith dropped on me I think we might need to kill a few more of them before the rain stops
D	yeah probably
A	my distraction didn't work
A	I feel the need to keep talking
A	the long silences I'm like well this is just worthless
A	you're trying to concentrate aren't you?
A	yeah we need to kind of keep this going I died again
D	or you end up just talking but you talk absolute rubbish
A	yeah you just talk nonsense don't you?
D	you don't even realise what you're talking about when you
A	yeah if we actually do like
D	yeah
A	right now a Wraith maybe
A	yeah I know I don't I don't like this level it's
A	it's it's really really difficult and there's not much that happens in the way of story except you get
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A's distraction worked	Contradiction
D	oh I'm dead
A	given Cortana oh you should be able to spawn yeah there you go
D	cool
A	let's have a look for the Wraiths
D	boing boing
A	is it there?
D	oh
A	get the mortar
D	oh is Victor around there?
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A and D are not looking for the Wraiths	Contradiction
A	er
[ANNOTATION]	Victor is not there	Neutral
A	I think he
D	okay
D	er
A	interrupt the guy?
D	whatever
A	is it open?
D	yeah he
D	there we go
A	do you want me to
D	yeah you can do
A	there's a Banshee there
D	it's what I'm best at
A	do you reckon you could get that Banshee?
D	nope I'm gonna distract
A	distract what?
D	well the enemy
A	don't go and die cos
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker D is going to try and make another distraction	Entailment
D	so they don't don't shoot you
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker D died	Contradiction
unknown_female	oh well done
A	did you?
D	yeah
unknown_female	ah
A	I'm EMP'd so good effort
A	oh my god I've er I've got hit by a Banshee shell so I'm already dead
A	oh my god I'm getting boarded
D	oh shit
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A dodged a Banshee's attack	Contradiction
A	right I blew it up but I got I got boarded I killed
D	right
A	the guy
D	ah oh
A	do we get the tank again? let's see
A	okay
D	is er is that where we are?
A	do you wanna come over here just so you're a little bit
D	yeah
A	closer to the phone?
A	no no like come and sit over here just so you're a bit closer to the phone
[ANNOTATION]	the guy will come back to life	Neutral
D	yeah yeah being a bit quiet over there am I? ah I don't sit over here normally do I?
A	is it weird?
D	the view's weird
A	the viewing angle
D	the colours look so vibrant from over here
A	gotta save that
[ANNOTATION]	the view is the best	Neutral
D	yeah
A	oh there's something there
D	yeah it's the Banshees
unknown_female	is it?
A	do you wanna maybe try and EMP him? oh that was close wasn't it?
unknown_female	try and shoot him down
A	mate I told you I'm good at it though
A	oh it's
D	oh
A	if you've got double
[ANNOTATION]	shooting is the best option	Neutral
A	I'm trying to actually make use of the mortar tank as a mortar tank but I need I need a spotter really
D	yeah
A	to try and tell me where where stuff's landing
D	mm
A	or we just keep firing until some numbers flash up on the screen
A	where are they?
D	that's bad
A	where are they?
D	er there's some Jackals coming up here
A	it's alright there's still more
[ANNOTATION]	there are more targets	Entailment
D	yeah
A	I'm just taking in obviously
D	shall I just go
A	no
A	er well I wouldn't if I knew you were shooting at me it'd help if we had sound but we
D	yeah
A	can't
D	it is quite hard
[ANNOTATION]	it is not easy	Entailment
A	you can you turn back the
D	yeah that's what I'm that's what I did with that one anyway
A	we'll just go to checkpoint which is good to be having a Wraith
A	in decent condition
A	I think this is where the Banshees
[ANNOTATION]	we have to stay here	Contradiction
D	is there an ammo drop at the top?
A	er possibly?
D	oh
A	there we go
D	and health kits that's good
A	shotguns are useless on
D	yeah
D	I know
A	oh I died I think the Wraith's fine though which is a little bit worrying
D	oh
A	we might need to go back and get the Wraith
A	oh
D	no
A	oh wow there's a party down there and we're not invited
A	it's alright
A	we might get the Wraith back now I'm not gonna do what I did again I'm gonna wait for them to come to me
D	yeah
A	oh
D	that that sucks
A	probably try and how do I stealth get in a Wraith?
A	oh I can't go that way the Ghosts are messing me up too much
D	oh god I think I've already got snipers on me
A	yeah I think you did as well
D	just er
A	er grenades are happy-time
D	yeah
A	I died again
D	oh I almost did and oh
A	if you die in quick succession when we start a checkpoint it'll put us back to the other one
D	oh er
A	did you not know that?
D	no
A	oh you don't do much on Legendary though do you?
D	no
A	I dunno if they
D	oh it was Jun that almost sniped me
A	oh was it? I was gonna say where the heck was er oh are you dead?
D	sometimes you get the heretic ones don't you? but
D	but yeah Jun has team killed me a lot in the past
A	I know right I'm gonna run round this way
A	yes
D	oh
A	two of me I just
D	yeah
A	fell off the map
D	problem is they sometimes shoot through the hologram at me
A	I fell off the map though
D	oh
unknown_female	I'm back
unknown_female	hi guys
D	I'm just gonna throw random grenades out
A	I'm gonna get the Brute shot just cos it it does wonders to their shield
D	yeah
A	does a Brute shot do increased Melee damage cos it has the blade on the front?
D	er
A	it doesn't does it?
D	I don't think so there isn't a Brute shot in this anyway it's a Concussion gun
A	not that I no no no there's the erm
D	oh the Spiker?
A	the Spiker that's what I meant
D	oh right yeah
A	yeah sorry my bad
A	oh grenade launchers that'll do
D	oh what?
A	it's so strange without sound
A	er that'd be quite an interesting like game type thing you know for custom games if you could erm
D	yeah
A	reduce like the players' like sounds so they had to play with like
D	oh yeah
A	no sound and then you could do like a hide and seek type thing couldn't you?
D	yeah it'd be kinda cool actually
A	I think that'd be kind of cool
D	I am getting that grenade launcher I love grenade launchers
A	I'm gonna try and get the Wraith if it's still down here I'm being shot at cos I can see the bullets I can't hear the bullets
D	I used to be like a deadeye with a er grenade launcher
B	hello
D	oh I'm dead
B	what are you playing?
A	Halo
B	oh mm
A	is that alright? cos
B	yeah why?
A	yeah
D	right I'm over on back I'll try and take on some of these turrets
A	we're trying to like keep talking through all of this so
B	I wouldn't worry too much
D	well I think the idea is you just do what you normally do
B	yeah yeah
unknown_female	I guess well we were just saying that like you'd er end up like rambling on and stuff
D	I'm dead again
A	I was really close to you
A	yeah that times that cowbell yeah times three accelerations?
A	not worth it I'm gonna
A	kill you again here
A	no you didn't die damn it I did
D	I
A	like mad tactical ducking
D	I totally heard
B	oh
A	how do you not die then?
A	well I've never done it
D	oh
A	how is it? oh for god's sake I got the kill though
D	yeah
unknown_female	it's not gonna give me to the checkpoint yes it is
D	oh nice
A	how did that not kill you? do you wanna get in the turret?
D	just gave me a little nudge er I don't think it would do much but why not?
A	yeah
D	want to reset
A	how come your? oh I control the vibration turned off from my I'm assuming my
A	like entire game thing
unknown_female	the problem is cos the thing's not on the front of it I'm just getting shot I'm probably gonna die
A	suicide
D	suicide mission in
A	how is this Ghost not dead? there we go
D	I'm trying to shoot it off the back but it's not working very well
A	oh balls
D	just er taking out some of the Jackals round you try and help you
A	the Jackals are actually what are doing like a lot of the damage to be honest
D	yeah
A	trying
D	oh
A	oh there's a Ghost down here
D	oh cool means I can go quickly between the turrets and die
A	yeah
D	whereabouts is it?
A	er back where I came from
D	down there towards the
A	down this way
D	oh right cool
A	you see where my
D	yeah
A	down there
D	got it
A	do you reckon I can get the Banshee again?
A	probably
D	no it's not it's the Banshee
unknown_female	nice
A	mm
D	checkpoint as well sorted
A	I can't tell where that's landing
A	come on
D	can you
A	I don't think so no I am not
D	does he come with the Scorpion sometimes?
A	oh being shot from behind
unknown_female	look at the Ghost oh
unknown_female	mm
unknown_female	well we get them
A	yeah
D	god they take
A	yeah they do
D	yeah just
A	splat and kill
D	there is a Phantom
A	yeah
D	over here
A	that's what killed me
A	there's a Ghost that comes out there as well so just
D	yeah I'll I'll try and ram down the bridge when they're
A	yeah
D	right that's some Jackal multi kills I didn't get the Elites
A	I died
D	oh Brute oh
A	oh right
A	oh god I didn't realise you'd died you were like that's some kills and I'm like
A	cool good work
D	well I told you I was going on a
A	yeah but I'm in a Wraith that's
A	prone to like
D	ram that was that was gonna be suicidal legendary
A	I just got boarded
D	right I got the Brutes that time
A	oh very nice
D	or one of them almost got the Ghost he's gonna kill me though
A	yeah I know we're gonna yeah there we go right I'm not gonna send
A	the Wraith down there cos the Wraith actually gets messed up by the er the Phantom marks the Concussion charge
unknown_female	right yeah
A	it really limits
D	yeah
A	I dunno why I said limits really weirdly then
A	really limits your ability to er drive forward
A	cos it's not like you've got wheels or anything cos
A	I might actually go and er try and shoot them there cos it's a little bit closer to home
A	that hit something
A	my god
D	well I'm sure you probably take out the Brutes
A	oh I'm being shot at from behind what is shooting at me?
D	right I think that's the last one over there
A	I died from a Banshee
D	right I'll try and spawn
A	can you er? oh for fuck's sake right yeah we'll just do it on foot it'll be easier I think my shields have immediately run down
D	I do not like let
D	I can't hear your death noise without the sounds
A	yeah I know I
D	okay if you if you wanna focus that bridge then I'll go on a suicide ram down towards the other Phantom
A	yeah just the er the Banshee shoots me
D	oh okay
A	well the Banshee's not down that straight
D	yeah but I'm still doing a suicide ram down this straight cos
A	okay
A	oh I got shot out the Wraith and the Wraith's still alive
D	oh I'll try and spawn you first
A	you might want to erm you might wanna kill yourself to be honest
D	right suicide ram?
A	just
A	right erm I dunno what to use the Wraith for then cos the Wraith's just pretty useless now that it's on fire
A	suicide ram we can't both suicide ram
A	cos then we'll just have
D	yeah
A	on the same checkpoint
A	I'm trying I
A	I'm I'm being shot at by quite a lot of stuff to be honest
A	I'm dead
D	I'm gonna shoot off the top then
A	but we've done alright there so if you wanna spawn
D	yeah
A	me we can try and get a checkpoint I might grab a grenade launcher just to er
D	yeah there there it is
A	keep hold of it
A	oh there's none left never mind erm
D	er there's one round here somewhere where
A	yeah I know I dropped one on the floor like over here there's a
D	I got killed by a really well placed grenade when I was back here
A	oh really?
D	yeah
A	that
D	oh great
A	I could've used the Wraith for that
D	right I'm going on a suicide ram turn that turret back on
A	what the heck shot me then? I don't actually know what it was that killed me
D	no
A	some Hunters oh my god the Hunters
D	it's shall shall we try try and lure them in? oh they're just gonna walk up to the top aren't they?
A	yeah
D	except they can't go into a turret
A	I just assassinated an Elite and then I got killed by a Hunter
A	by assassinating the Elite
D	yeah
A	oh we're being Concussion shelled by something
D	yeah that's not fun
A	can I assassinate the Hunter? no
D	right I think I might blow its
A	mm
D	right
A	oh it's dropped Elites as well
D	oh
A	oh and they got a Hunter shelled in the face
D	erm
A	thank you very nice of you
D	I'm sorry I think that was my grenade
A	no
A	oh right good good top well done
D	yeah
A	oh
D	oh come on spawn spawn me
D	there are Needles slowly
D	taking my health down
A	just restore your health
D	yeah
A	there you go
A	no there we go
unknown_female	is that an Engineer down there?
D	right Engineer's down
A	oh right cool that'll make it a bit easier I'm dead again by the way
D	oh
D	it's okay we can go inside now just stay away
A	oh my god Emile
D	did you just punch him to death?
A	no Emile punched him to death
D	oh god
A	I know we look very similar
D	yeah
A	I'm going for that
A	oh that'd have come in handy
A	here we go
D	the amount of times you've played this you should've realised that
A	I
D	oh right
A	just cos it's such a pain
D	yeah
A	I'd love to know what's happening in the cut scene
D	erm there was some
A	oh have you seen the Halo room? oh yeah that's
D	oh yeah that's
A	I've been in it it's quite cool
A	you go to like er different erm like computers and they tell you like different things I dunno what they say
D	yeah
A	I can't remember but you you press X and there's a prompt that comes up and
D	that's pretty cool
A	yeah
D	there's all references to red versus blue or something as well isn't there?
A	yeah there is yeah
D	yeah
A	you can't tell when anyone else is speaking cos they're all wearing helmets
D	yeah well his head's moving slightly he's
D	he's
A	but Emile's is moving they're all moving
A	little bit
D	but Emile he almost never talks so
A	mm
A	his death in this is pretty good as well to be honest
D	yeah
unknown_female	I'm ready how about you?
A	and then stabs it in the face
A	do you not remember?
D	yeah I do yeah
A	yeah
A	Jun just nothing happens to Jun he's
D	yeah
A	er he just he er
D	oh there's theories that he er escaped on the Pillar of Autumn isn't there?
A	mm
D	what do you mean?
A	cos erm
D	yeah
A	erm and then
D	yeah yeah you do the rest of the mission with Emile but
A	Jun?
D	and Jun
A	Jun?
D	isn't there
A	he just disappears doesn't he at some point?
A	oh this is what it's like she shows you
A	have you not seen that
D	oh I think I might've done actually
A	it's er just like some cut scenes with this and she says to erm
unknown_female	yeah
A	after
D	yeah
A	exploded
D	yeah
A	so I'm assuming this is where Jun disappears
D	oh yeah he stays with Halsey
A	coward
D	just realised my chicken nuggets
A	chicken nuggets
D	are still in the oven
A	we're good
unknown_female	alright
B	oh I remember
B	hello
A	how do?
B	why? how? why hasn't it saved it?
A	well it don't matter it it doesn't matter but
B	oh
B	why?
A	yeah we just entered a campaign on Legendary
B	oh
A	but on
B	yeah
A	on the previous mission it disappears
A	and now we're on that one
B	oh that's weird why's it done that?
A	er cos we stopped here and then we did this one
B	oh okay
A	and er
A	he thought it'd er it'd combine but no
B	mm that's good
A	yeah
A	how long is it? oh it's about half an hour
B	mm
A	er
A	I woke up
B	house
A	we finally went to the one that was er cancelled yesterday
B	the
B	oh right yeah yeah yeah
A	literally just round the corner
B	yeah
A	it was really really good it's obviously in like a really really great place cos it's not fair far from where we are now
B	yeah
A	erm the only problem is not all the rooms are like identical
B	oh okay so is there one like like really tiny one?
A	picking the best rooms is a little bit interesting yeah
B	you can just draw straws like cos that way it's fair
A	yeah well there's that and the fact that like me and
B	yeah
A	of the world so er I I know
B	yeah
A	this time
B	okay
A	erm I dunno how it's gonna work out we wanted to talk to
B	mm
A	gonna go for it cos it is like quite popular but whether
B	tonight? oh she's coming here tonight?
A	she says she's in town now so
B	oh okay cool
A	so we're just gonna meet and discuss that
B	as long as they don't mind
A	probably not
A	mm
D	did it
A	no it didn't
C	the sauce is done
B	it's done?
C	the sauce is done
B	I'm checking it now
D	oh for fuck's sake
A	I said to
D	no
A	no it's
D	such a horrible mission
A	yeah it's letting you do it but it hasn't recorded it as Legendary
D	oh right okay well at least we can move on to the next
D	the thing is I've done it on Heroic
A	I know you've
D	that's what annoys me
A	I know
D	because I went on your Xbox it just wiped it
A	oh did it?
D	yeah
A	but I've done it on your Xbox and it's not wiped mine
D	dunno
A	I don't think so anyway mind you is Pillar of Autumn the last level?
D	might be
A	oh no Lone Wolf's there as well
D	oh yeah that's not really like
A	do you wanna go for it then? or?
D	er well I'm eating at the moment but
C	no
C	I'm still I'm still I'm about to eat
B	we're we're both about to eat
A	I'll do both
B	see how
B	oh my god please do it and see how
A	do you want me to try?
B	see how it works out
A	how the heck am I gonna do do this?
B	this is where you need four hands
A	this is where if I do that I can do trigger
A	and do stick trigger stick trigger stick trigger
B	can you do it with like can you just like let one of them die and then do it with the other one? will it still work? or will it
A	it could but oh right
B	will it be more difficult?
A	I could just do it like that yeah I'll just
D	you you can just use
A	I'll use you as a spawn point
A	I'd love to know what's happening in this cut scene
B	you could put subtitles on
C	well there's no point is there?
B	well why not?
C	are they saying words?
D	yeah
B	well they will be at some point won't they?
A	oh
B	yeah see?
B	see? what would you do without me?
A	it's so weird cos their voices are actually playing in my head right now
D	yeah
C	weird
C	weird
C	I can't imagine any voices go with that
D	does your character
C	yeah
D	or do you say like yes sir at the beginning
C	yeah basically
D	I can't remember
A	that timing though
A	Emile's chilled about everything let's be honest
A	oh see this is annoying so you get the AI don't you?
A	no no but like it's on your back
A	it's not on my back I don't think
A	and
D	no
D	no
A	I dunno how long this recording has to be but I think doing this mission on top of the one that we've just done might be a bit overkill
A	now you can how the heck do you do this?
A	yeah
A	this is how you do it on Laso
D	yeah
A	yeah I know
A	it will do at some point I'll just leave you on a bridge
A	I've played this game too much
A	oh
A	oh yeah you can get kicked by the Scarab like up the mountain
A	yeah
D	oh
A	I did a
D	oh no no no
A	oh
D	oh
A	there you go you've spawned
A	you're drawing fire it's alright
A	and you control this er getting shot at
A	you are still alive how?
A	mate you've got a shield and everything
A	I'm still on full health though which is quite impressive
D	Covenant got scared off by the Scarab
A	yeah but yeah if you get kicked by the Scarab you can get kicked like up the cliff and like
A	you go flying
D	Scarab just doesn't even care that I'm there
A	oh no
A	that was the checkpoint bit as well
D	I'll probably be spawning
A	oh
D	oh never mind I'm getting shot now
A	oh for
A	oh
A	move er
D	oh you've got a checkpoint
A	oh good yay we've got a checkpoint with no vehicle we need to make the
D	yeah I know that's what I was saying I thought you were trying to kill yourself
A	possibly
D	there's one
A	nice one boing
A	cool
A	yeah
A	from the er
D	done this mission so many times
A	yeah I've forgot you should wait in the tunnels before the er the Phantom disappears er before the Phantom disappears until the Phantom disappears cos otherwise you die the way I did when you do this jump
A	nothing's gonna shoot me now when I do the jump
A	you said backflip?
D	yeah
A	yeah
D	ready for er mad mad Wraith boardings
A	oh
A	mother
A	right I'll spawn on you and then we're good to go
A	yes
A	hi hello this is my house welcome
D	take them out with you
A	try that again
A	mate we're ready for round three
D	watch him
A	like ah
A	mate round four is where it's at let's go
A	well he still has his face mask so
A	I presume I got him
A	I wanna catch it
A	what? why's this funny?
D	just it's seems a bit and again
D	and again
A	I wanna catch it no
A	you'd think they could put like an explosive like charge in like the armour so in the event of a Spartan's death it would like explode
D	that'd be an amazing armour ability
A	oh yeah
A	or no but like there's a delay or something or
D	mm
A	like a remote thing for like your squad mate
unknown_female	yeah
A	hey Grunt you just
A	I didn't even get a chance to move
A	beep-beep mother fuckers
D	oh
A	thank you for blowing up that installation my good friend
A	what?
D	how did you manage
A	I think er I think it all stuck in his shield and then exploded
D	oh I thought it bounced off shields
A	apparently I super-combined as a Jackal you saw it happen so
D	yeah I know yeah
A	where the heck did he go?
D	I thought
A	maybe it's the angle
D	mm maybe
A	holy
A	better get a Needler
D	there was one on the floor
A	can't wait to see this mentioned
A	do you reckon I could super-combine the guy out of it?
D	mm it's possible but I doubt it
A	probably best to just getting the er the rifle is there a sniper rifle in here?
A	no no no no it was right where I was as well
D	nice
A	what? I dodged that
A	you saw me dodge that didn't you?
D	headshot
A	I got head-shotted by a Wraith
A	mortar
D	yeah
A	yeah I did
D	yeah I saw you
A	oh right okay
B	oh cheers
B	I said oh cheers
D	you could do it yourself and be like punch this
A	yeah you can stand on it but then if you fall off it's just a little bit of a pain
D	yeah
A	where do I go now? oh I go up here sorry it's been a while
D	I'll go and wash my
A	oh sorry guys
A	like on my own on Legendary
B	is it difficult on your own?

A	and I've just run back now oh wow
B	it's
unknown_female	mm
C	well
A	it's nice indeed

A	oh god there's another one
A	oh I'll have that definitely I'll have that
A	did you see
B	oh I think I liked that gun

D	yeah
unknown_female	mm
B	yeah that was what
C	and er
C	Carter no
B	oh what is that?
C	that's a Scarab and Carter just crashed a Pelican into it
D	I thought that was a bit of a waste a Pelican and a Spartan to kill a Scarab
C	mm
A	er was it a waste? I think it yeah probably a little bit to be honest now if you think about it but Carter was oh my god we're not meant to jump off there
A	whoops
A	sorry guys
D	er how how many more times have you played this mission than me?
A	er alright okay
A	I'm gonna get a DMR hold on
A	I must go my people need me
A	I'd er to be honest Needler for this would be pretty dire to be honest
A	cos you've all the Buggers haven't you? they're actually called Buggers
D	mm
B	really?
A	and it's not swearing
C	well it
C	wait er er wait bugger's a swearing?
A	bugger?

D	buggering is doing someone up the bum
B	is it?
A	yeah did you not know that?
B	I knew it was
C	I didn't know it was swearing
B	I knew it was swearing but I didn't know that's what it actually meant
A	yeah no you engage in buggery you engage in

A	yeah I well I I had a DMR with ten shots cos you took it all
C	bruv is this Glee?
B	yeah
C	why?
C	don't join in
C	I will sing on my own
unknown_female	why doesn't Grunt birthday party apply to the Buggers though?
D	it'd be so satisfying
A	it well it would cos
A	killing these
D	yeah I am almost dead now one more shot I would've died
C	oh the
A	the banter it's all about that banter
D	throw some grenades at them in case they land
D	there's er er let the marine go in there
A	the marine? you mean Emile?
D	that's Emile

C	yeah
A	oh you go on run around the corner dickhead sorry I'll try not to you should hear me censoring myself on this
B	no don't worry it's fine
A	I'm like holy er moley
C	I don't bother censoring myself
C	you either get all of me or none of me
A	no I don't wanna reload I wanted to pick up that weapon
unknown_female	yeah
A	I just picked up the er Needle Rifle
D	assault rifle suicide time
A	it's time I just shot the two that you just ran at
D	oh yeah I
B	you know I said I was gonna start eating slower? cos I
C	yeah
B	I get bloated really quickly?
B	yeah
B	I well I was just so hungry I can't wait I'm just like just like
C	well I get that as well
B	but like really recently I keep like eating way too much and then
C	way too much
B	like really my stomach really hurts afterwards
A	oh I just shot
D	you stole my
unknown_female	mm
A	what? I picked
D	yeah I killed that Skirmisher
A	it's alright there's a there's a grenade launcher there
D	I wanted I wanted it
C	er what what do we need the grenade launcher for?
A	oh it's erm
C	what's this map called in multiplayer?
A	er
C	it begins with a B doesn't it?
A	yeah we need to er
A	we need to we need to er combine fire on the Elites to get these down
D	right
A	I dunno if you wanna
A	do you? oh right okay
C	I might bring my
B	what?
C	mm
B	mm
C	Ocarina
B	wait which one did you bring?
C	I've got Twilight Princess and Skyward Sword with me
B	Ocarina of Time's the creepy one right?
C	no Majora's Mask is the creepy one
B	oh yeah
A	no
B	so how come both of those are like to do with time?
unknown_female	Zelda
B	Majora's Mask is to do with time isn't it?
C	that's cos it's a sequel to Ocarina
B	oh fairs
B	really?
C	the Zelda timeline
C	I'll show you the video that I got at school
B	mm
C	and the latest game is the first game in the chronology
B	oh really?
C	mm end of the timeline
B	thirty years? really?
C	thirty years
A	I am just emptying rounds into this guy and he oh there we go got him
D	yeah
A	okay you might wanna charge in
D	shall I charge?
A	yeah
D	oh there's a DMR here take that
D	er no I'll still shoot that
A	oh do you get the kill?
unknown_female	yeah
unknown_female	I saw I
D	I was gonna say
A	there's little Skirmishers
D	oh no
A	oh
A	hey I'm back oh I have ammo for some reason I just shot Emile in the back of the head
A	get let me get the Ranger
B	how come you guys have got friendly fire on? can you not turn it off?
D	that's just a thing of Halo
A	it's just yeah it's always
B	oh is it?
D	probably not very good
A	I'm dead oh you're dead
unknown_female	we're all dead
C	well
D	yeah
C	like cos in real life if you shoot someone in the back of the head
A	I took it back
D	who are you shooting at?
A	er we'll probably need to go for the Elite
D	jump up fire a couple of shots and then
B	to be honest if I played a game where friendly fire was on like I would probably be really bad
C	that'd be amazing cos
A	it's not like we're put in a situation where we're only gonna hit one another
B	no I know but I'm just that
A	like look we're literally looking
A	at like he's on the ground there I can see it says
D	yeah
A	hitting him's gonna be quite a challenge
D	most of the time is either explosives or on purpose so
A	yeah
A	I'm just having a look for weapons in here cos
D	er there's a new rifle here by the way if you wanna
A	er there's DMRs in here
D	I I I
A	there's DMRs in here mate
D	oh cool
A	there's loads of dead marines as well
D	I'm dead
A	enemy nearby? oh
D	yeah there are lots of enemies nearby
A	get up the stairs
B	you're just walking against the stairs
A	I know
D	right it's back oh I have a DMR now as well cool
A	yeah you might have armour lock as well
B	what's DMR?
A	designated marksman's rifle
B	oh cool
D	it's the gun in Halo that actually hits the thing that you point at
A	yeah
C	do you prefer the DMR to the battle rifle? or are you you're not?
A	alright cool
B	I like I like the pesto
C	mm
B	yeah
C	mm
A	I like you
D	against
A	oh yeah yeah
D	DMR's more satisfying
A	yeah I'd rather have a
D	cos er
A	yeah cos I the battle rifle they're essentially are single firing so the battle rifle just happens to put three rounds down for every one or the
D	okay
D	oh there's another one
A	oh right
A	oh my god I nearly just walked off the cliff can I get this white Elite?
D	yeah go for it
B	is the er is the Ocarina of Time the one where you can choose like different ways to go?
C	mm
B	because it
A	is the Ocarina of Time the one where you've got a erm
A	you've got a certain amount of time?
C	no
B	oh
A	is the Ocarina of Time the one where you've got a certain amount of time before some big evil's gonna come and
C	no that's Majora's Mask
A	is that that Majora's Mask?
unknown_female	yeah
A	ah I see
A	oh I just got off on the oh
B	this looks like a really cool game it looks like er the the plotlines are very detailed isn't it?
A	mm
B	exactly I like that
A	yeah I wish I'd got into Zelda to be honest
B	same
C	it's brill
A	me and Emile are working on this
A	thanks Emile a bit late on that Melee there but you know
A	yeah I know cos all the
D	oh right
A	could we move yours through
D	no I
B	so wait which one was actually created first?
C	mm
C	this one
B	which one?
B	so like almost the last one?
C	yeah
B	in the
C	and the latest one
B	in the in the timeline really?
C	no
B	you don't?
B	no but like the actual ones in like chronological order?
C	er
B	do you have all of them?
B	like all of those?
C	no no
B	oh
C	cos some of them are
B	oh you can only get them on DS?
C	no some of them are on the DS yeah but I can't be arsed playing Zelda on the DS
B	oh I'll do it on the DS
C	no
B	can I play them?

B	which Pokémon do you have?
C	the latest one I had was like Platinum
B	could I could I play it please?
C	no
B	I haven't played Pokémon in ages
A	that's a cool story bro
C	I might have Ruby if you want
C	maybe
B	if anyone has Pokémon that they don't wanna play any more cos
C	I had silver but the silver doesn't fit in DS any more
B	oh
C	cos er the cartridge is slightly bigger
B	oh wait yeah it depends like it depends where DS gave it like cos they only have the older one well not the
C	oh no no it's not that it
B	not the old old I have DS Light
C	yeah yeah I had the DS Light and the Silver doesn't fit the DS Light the Silver only fit the Gameboy Advance SP
B	oh right okay
C	I had the Gameboy Advance SP
A	what?
unknown_female	what kind of rubbish is what?
D	that they make it a slightly bigger cartridge that only fits the SP
A	well not the cartridge it's no no
B	yeah
A	they made it slightly smaller after the new one came out but it's so that you
D	it's like
A	keep buying the newer games isn't it?
D	but the Gameboy Advance SPs played Gameboy Advance games
A	yeah I know but the Nintendo DS Light does not play Gameboy Advance games
D	it does
A	I I know but it doesn't play all of them cos one of them's a slightly bigger cartridge
A	my Pokémon Silver is erm it the cartridge is a lot taller like it sticks out the top you know how normally it would fit in the top and it would just kind of like rest there?
unknown_female	yeah
unknown_female	the Silver would poke out the top and it's a little bit wider
D	oh right okay
A	but it it did fit the SP erm but it doesn't fit
A	no not yet I've had enough
C	I've got I probably I probably
B	mm oh
B	mm and these are all the games that
C	yeah
B	and how many of these have you played?
C	maybe make er I started that one
B	why?
B	oh why don't you like playing it on the DS?

A	cos he's
D	cos I'm running in and attacking the Hunters
C	fair dos

D	oh
A	come over here
