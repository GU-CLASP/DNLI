B	appreciate it
A	honestly don't even worry about it it's fine like cos originally when it happened I I mean we were talking about Valentine's Day and erm or like what are you gonna do for
A	which
B	it's so cute
A	didn't make much sense
A	but he tried erm so I were replying in French because he'd send like five six Snapchats saying what have you just said and I like
B	oh
A	erm okay give me five minutes and I were just translating it into French
B	yeah
A	so my French were probably terrible but his English were just as terrible so we were sort of like talking in French and English to each other like trying to arrange it and erm I was like why aren't we even why aren't we using Facebook? we've both got Facebook
A	we could use the Facebook message
B	Snapchat's so long as well
B	that's why when I came through with the roses I like hugged you because I just assumed like I didn't think that he would have done that and I hugged you thinking oh you've given it to me because you know that I'm like upset and that he's not here and when you were like pushed me away like that's not from me I was like
B	what?
B	just in such a state of shock like oh god
B	literally literally
A	but yeah er I was like when he was when he were when we were talking about it I was like oh he's so sweet gonna love it he was so surprised oh
B	cos er on Skype as well
A	oh bless him
B	literally loved it it's so amazing
A	but erm
B	yeah
A	I went and found the nicest bouquet that I could find
B	it was beautiful
A	and I were just like she'll love them and they're from
B	I did love them they were beautiful
A	so but yeah as if I'd do anything as cheesy as buy you flowers on Valentine's Day?
B	well I didn't know
A	if you didn't have a boyfriend I would have done that but
A	you have a boyfriend so
B	yeah
A	and I knew that
B	but roses do have a lot of meaning to me like because they're roses as well it's romantic
A	your middle name
B	but also
A	as well
B	yeah cos he always says do you remember when I told you that he was like you represent for me what a rose represents like all red and blah blah blah
B	really cheesy
A	yeah
B	but it had so much more meaning
A	yeah
B	I was just like oh
A	I'm just being sick inside right now
A	just from the cheese the pure cheese
B	it's cool I haven't had a lot of cheese in my life
B	so
A	there you go well or if I
B	making up for lost time
A	on Friday night me and
B	oh
A	so I were like oh it's here and it weren't there so we ended up watching it online but I literally was an emotional wreck the whole way through I was just sat there crying my eyes out
B	you can't not cry
A	you can't not cry at that
B	at that film it's beautiful
A	no exactly
B	it's beautiful
A	and I were just like I was saying to
B	it's like The Notebook
A	I love The
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	and it like goes back in time to tell their story
A	mm
B	basically every time I watch that film I literally I can't watch it alone I need to be
A	yeah
B	surrounded by at least three people because I am literally so depressed
A	yeah
B	sit there questioning life
B	it was like
B	I love it
A	no I'm the same with PS I Love You like I know it word for word I read the book a million times I've seen
B	mm
A	the film a million times and erm his nan and granddad got me it for Christmas actually one year like erm last year they got it me for Christmas
B	oh
A	because I'd said for
A	erm
B	that's so lovely
A	oh I love you oh they were asking about you this weekend
B	really?
A	yeah and do you know what I said to
A	you know he said the same thing to
B	yeah
B	they're
A	they just eat weird stuff
B	they're so thoughtful though
A	well yeah they were so cute
B	it's lovely
A	they're like well will you eat any of this? and not he's never had a Yorkshire pudding
B	yeah
A	never had a Yorkshire pudding and I'm like how have you never had a Yorkshire pudding? oh yeah those Yorkshire puddings yeah
B	it's very English though
B	isn't it?
A	he he didn't have he's never had mint sauce with anything but lamb
B	what?
A	yes missing out big time or what
B	freak
A	so he had erm mint sauce with beef and his Yorkshire pudding
B	sounds good
A	and gravy he asked us what the gravy were
A	and I'm like how do you not know what gravy is? it's like one of those greatest creations that man has ever made
A	and you have it with everything anything that you want it with you will have it with except pizza that would be weird
B	I'd imagine it being quite nice actually
A	mm
B	I can imagine it being nice with pasta
A	mm
B	mm
A	really calorific though
B	we should try that one day
A	yeah but erm but yeah they were asking about you like erm cos obviously the weekend that you're in Doncaster is my nephew's christening
B	yeah
A	I keep wanting to say funeral it's doing my head in
B	don't say that
A	I know
B	oh that's lovely
A	for Sunday dinner like you could come for Saturday dinner but it's not quite the same
B	it's not it's not the same
A	so
B	it's not the same
A	and I want to go that psychic and all that other stuff so
B	yeah I don't think we'll be able to do it this time but we could do it
A	we don't have enough time do we so
B	yeah
A	but
B	I'm really excited for our weekend at
A	oh I'm I'm really excited as well well cos we went out on Saturday night and it were really good
B	yeah
A	bumped into my ex-boyfriend
B	really?
A	yeah my first boyfriend
B	oh yeah
A	erm and it were really weird cos he's got really massive like muscular and I were just like I'm so glad I'm not with you right now
A	and he were massive and I was just like hi
A	yeah
B	how are they doing?
A	alright I think
B	yeah?
A	which which is nice to see cos even though I mean we were both just as bad as each other in that relationship it weren't just one sided it were me as well and I don't and that's not condoning anything he did or anything I did but it weren't just him I provoked him and I did the same to him as he did to me
B	yeah
A	and I'm not gonna pass myself off as a victim because it weren't like that at all erm
B	yeah
A	cos he weren't a bad guy you know we were both just as bad as each other and I think we were just destructive together
B	yeah
A	but
B	but it's nice that you can see each other on good terms
A	yeah well I bump into him like if I ever go out round
B	mm
A	and we'll talk and have a chat and stuff but
B	erm
A	no
B	no
A	I think I might invite her out on Thursday
B	I was gonna say I think that things will be okay though
A	yeah
B	cos like
A	it'll be awkward for a few minutes but then it'll fine
B	cos I know this doesn't really mean anything but like she's liked some of my posts on Facebooks and photos and stuff and like if you were angry at someone you wouldn't
A	no
B	genuinely do I know it has like no meaning
A	no yeah
B	but it's true you wouldn't do that
A	yeah
B	I think things are
A	yeah I think
B	I think they're fine
A	I don't want to lose her as a friend but I'm we needed to put our foot down we needed to say look
B	yeah
A	we don't want to live with
B	yeah
A	view that fantastic house
B	but to honest I think things will be okay because she must realise how awkward a situation it is and I think the reason that we haven't spoken for a while is because we're angry but she must be just as ashamed
A	yeah
B	do you know what I mean?
A	yeah
B	so I think if we make the first move to talk to her it will show her that we are okay and she doesn't
A	yeah
B	need to feel embarrassed or
A	worry about yeah
B	yeah
A	no she should feel embarrassed cos what she did were wrong but it shouldn't cost a friendship because
B	yeah
A	there's no need for it to cost a friendship we had an argument it's over that's it
B	but you have
A	we're still friends
B	you have arguments with friends
A	exactly you're always gonna have arguments
B	and sometimes if you're not happy with something that's happening you need to say it
A	yeah exactly
B	mm
A	because then you're just gonna build it up and then er all of a sudden you're gonna fall out and not talk to each other for months and months and months
B	yeah it could end the friendship
A	yeah
B	but no yeah we should invite her cos then at least she can turn it down if she wants to or
A	yeah
B	just give her the option
A	yeah
B	it would be nice
A	definitely
B	but I am I am looking forward to it cos if we can't get into
A	yeah
B	we'll go to that erm
A	yeah
B	but it was later on in the night but I'm sure it will be fine
A	yeah
B	earlier as well
A	I mean we I'll I've got a student card now so
B	yeah
A	I if er as long as I make sure I take that out with me with my passport we should be fine getting into places cos they were really funny that time weren't they when we didn't have our students cards
B	yeah but then
A	like they would not let us in
B	but then again when I went with
A	it might be because you were with me because I look older and I am older cos like they looked at my passport and then they asked for my student ID
B	yeah
A	it might be because I'm older
B	but also it might be because
A	right
B	cos they saw that I was with
A	yeah
B	and then they obviously came back to smoke as I was gone cos I went to look for them
A	yeah
B	so I think it was just like a misunderstanding and they thought that I'd left
A	yeah
B	erm but then when I rang her and she came and got me so maybe because they'd already been in they let us back in
A	yeah cos they thought yeah yeah do you have to pay to get in
B	no
A	no that's alright then cos
B	yeah
A	and that's only to
B	isn't it
A	you know
B	that
A	yeah
B	I'm happy to pay like it's the same for
A	yeah I don't mind that but when you go somewhere new and you don't know what it's like and you've never been there before you don't know what sort of people are there you don't know
B	yeah
A	I don't like
B	I did as well but I think that's a shame because erm all the stories that everyone's told me that always like
A	yeah
B	I was really hyped to go
A	yeah
B	I think it was just a bad night
A	yeah I think it were just cos it was so busy we waited for forty minutes the buzz that we had from pre-drinking had gone
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	so I think it's just a shame cos our first experience was a bad one but I'm I'm happy to give it another try
A	yeah me too
B	but maybe a different time and a different night or
A	yeah
B	or like
A	I I will give it
B	just get there a bit earlier maybe
A	yeah or maybe just erm go a bit later on in term because if we go later on in term a lot people have work to do and it won't be oh yeah refreshers we're back at uni we're
B	yeah
A	away from our parents again sort of thing
B	cos all everyone had just finished their exams I think that's why it was such a big night
A	yeah
B	cos it was packed
A	yeah cos that's the reason I went out that Thursday cos I'd just finished my exams
B	yeah
A	so
B	like erm
A	yeah
B	the best night I have had
A	really?
B	in
A	even better than the first week?
B	yeah
A	really?
B	it's it was
A	yeah we'd have to go we'll have to go
B	it was it was packed and obviously I was sober for about two hours where I didn't enjoy myself me and
A	yeah
B	and all the people like at first the people annoyed me because there were so many of them
A	yeah
B	but then I
A	yeah
B	it's amazing
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	but when it's every single Thursday you've gotta pay seven eight pound to get in it's like well hang on
B	yeah
A	I don't think so
B	but again that's why I didn't mind because I spent sixteen pounds to get in but I didn't buy drinks all night
A	right okay
B	I I didn't buy anything I just got glasses of water
A	right
B	it was totally worth it
A	yeah
B	spent less that night there on a big night expensive to get in and stuff than I did on a normal night when we
A	yeah
B	go to like
A	yeah
B	actually turned out cheaper
B	yeah
A	for a treble
B	and it's really nice the
A	yeah
B	other places and that's why I don't mind spending money cos I know I'll have a good night
A	yeah cos there's always loads of floor space as well ain't there there's like the bits in the middle that are like erm
B	yeah
A	and then there's places like but then there's places that you can stand away from it so like there's like I don't know if you've noticed it but there's a seating area some near bar somewhere
B	yeah on the side bit
A	yeah and then there's like the bar which is never too rammed either
B	but there's also a bar you know the stairs in the house music part?
A	yeah
B	there are stairs that go upstairs and there's a whole seating booth area with erm another bar so you go there if you don't feel like dancing and you just want a quiet places to sit
A	yeah
B	you still have the music but it's never packed because obviously everyone's dancing
A	yeah yeah
B	like when I went with
A	yeah
B	managed to get a seat by the bar it was empty and
A	that's really good that actually
B	I like that I actually like that cos there's a place for everything and there's a
A	yeah
B	quiet area there's that outside area where you can go if you just wanna be away from everything
A	yeah
B	two different rooms with two different types of music
A	yeah
B	it's got everything you need
A	it's good that innit?
B	it's amazing
A	oh I'm dreading this detox like
B	yeah
A	do you know what I mean? I don't feel like cos
B	ooh healthy
A	yeah but the I can't have porridge on its own without anything cos it's just so vile
B	it tastes horrible
A	it's
B	I need sugar
B	I need a lot of sugar
A	that's why I bought the strawberries to go with it cos I thought if I buy it cos they're only one fifty from Asda they were like a little punnet
B	mm
A	erm l like I would put them in because then I can't taste the
B	yeah
A	I can't taste the porridge so I'll be fine
B	I like it with bananas
A	mm yeah
B	cos bananas are so so naturally sweet
A	yeah
B	all through the year like
A	you don't need anything with the
B	cos strawberries sometimes when they're not in season
A	they're a bit sour
B	they can be a bit tasteless
A	yeah
B	but bananas are just always so nice
A	mm well I've got some more grapes but I've got frozen grapes as well so
B	okay
A	the frozen grapes I'll just keep for wine because I think they
B	yeah
A	if I take them out they're gonna go off straight away
B	they won't be very nice like
A	no
B	when when you freeze fruit and like defrost it it never tastes
A	no
B	very nice
A	so we'll just keep them for erm the wine because while they it doesn't alter the flavour of the wine for a start but then when they've melted and you eat them they just taste like wine
B	yeah I've had a few grapes
A	so
B	from the punnet we have in the fridge
A	yeah
B	but I've only had a few because I don't think they're quite ripe yet like they
A	oh right
B	they were still a bit sour
A	yeah
B	and they're not starting to go off or anything I think I'm just gonna leave them
A	yeah
B	for a few more days cos they were a bit sour
A	yeah that's what I like though about shopping at there because you can buy stuff that are not quite ripe yet yeah fair enough you have to leave it a few days but at least you're not forced to eat them straight away either
B	cos they're gonna go off
A	because they're gonna go off
B	like when we bought it up the meat market
A	yeah
B	I was quite disappointed in that actually
A	yeah I were disappointed in that
B	things didn't last very long
A	no
B	I think we'll just stick to buying meat there
A	yeah
B	erm
A	yeah definitely I mean if I'm gonna cook something that night and I want some fresh veg something that I wouldn't
B	yeah
A	yeah so like an aubergine or like something like that that I'm gonna cook that night then I'd buy it because you can just buy them singular
B	yeah yeah
A	I'd probably buy something like that but for bulk for week I just I can't justify it cos you have it goes out of date so quick
B	well so we had to throw away whole peppers
A	yeah
B	it's just such a waste of money
A	yeah so and the
B	and we were really excited about it as well like oh this is going like good money it's going straight to the producers it's all fresh and stuff but
A	yeah but then it just went out of date it's like well
B	yeah
A	that's money chucked down the brain basically
B	like it's like it's good out of principle but we can't really afford to do that right now
A	yeah yeah
B	as a lifestyle choice
B	we're not quite there yet it is
A	it is so expensive like
B	mm
A	I don't know why cos it's the same but like we're quite lucky that we've got
B	we just wouldn't do it
A	and we wouldn't do it
B	we literally wouldn't do it
A	we'd just go to Morrisons or something
B	yeah I do like Morrisons though like the whole Savers brand and stuff it is really cheap
A	yeah
B	which is what I buy like toilet roll bread those kind like cereals and stuff
A	yeah and we get free toilet roll
B	I get all of that on Savers so
A	we get free toilet roll from
B	though
A	really?
B	yeah but she's
A	well I've got another thing in there
B	she was erm quite ill
A	yeah she said
B	this weekend
A	that she weren't very well
B	cos obviously you know that she's got like a really low metabolism so if I got a cold she would get flu
A	yeah
B	like erm your
A	yeah
B	starting to speak like a Yorkshire person
A	I know
B	your your
A	your
B	yeah she was quite ill and obviously after that day of travel and stuff and
A	yeah
B	she's got IBS like she's just found out she's got IBS
A	really?
B	which is one of the reasons why she gets so irritated
A	right
B	so the smallest thing just sets her off and she just gets sick all the time
A	god that's awful
B	I felt so sorry for her cos like I've been fine all week and as soon as I get to
B	and I was just like it's okay no one's judging you
B	did you?
A	yeah do you know erm the erm
B	can I have another one?
A	yeah yeah do you know the medical er testing place where you get paid loads of money to like do
B	when you walk through uni?
A	yeah that
B	yeah
A	car park thing
B	would you like one?
A	yes please erm well I was walking out there cos
B	shouted
A	I were like I were like yeah and he were like he looked at me and then and looked as his friends and he went to his friends and he went I was gonna take a lift guys
A	see you back home
B	ah that's nice through
A	yeah it was the first literally first time I've seen him
B	yeah
A	since before way before Christmas
B	I've seen him
A	at the ball the last time I saw him
B	I've seen him obviously the first day he got back but he was busy so I literally just said hello in passing like
A	yeah
B	happy Christmas blah blah the second time I saw him was by the place again walking to from uni but it was pouring rain so neither of us stopped to talk
A	yeah
B	we were just like hi and then the last time was erm he was coming out of his bedroom as me and
A	right
B	cos I took her down to TGI's and we were gonna eat there
A	yeah
B	on Saturday night erm but we got there and they were like one hour waiting time and we were like
A	yeah
B	so just ended up going to Wagamama but obviously we had to walk home and change because we thought if we go for dinner now we can go like not dressed up
A	yeah
B	come home and get dressed and get a taxi
A	yeah
B	but seeing as we were halfway into town to
A	yeah
B	but
A	yeah I know what you mean
B	we ended up being really late but it was cool cos we weren't pre-drinking that night obviously
A	yeah yeah
B	so we just got there had a bit of time to chill and then left
A	yeah
B	mm
A	yeah
B	and she was like what? how? and I was like
B	and I was like I've been here a month already she was like third time in a month?
B	she was like
B	yeah well I don't any more cos obviously I don't eat as much as I did
A	yeah
B	and I've just I've stopped like buying wine and stuff so I probably spend like ten to thirteen pounds in total
A	yeah
B	which is better
A	yeah me and
B	yeah
A	cos it's so
B	yeah I think erm well the other night obviously cos we were on our way we'd bought just a bottle of cider like to share
A	yeah
B	cos obviously we couldn't drink much erm just to like get ourselves a bit
A	yeah
B	in the mood and stuff erm and I had it in the Nisa bag and I just walked in with it
A	yeah
B	and put it under the table like they didn't notice so you could probably get wine that way in
A	yeah
B	I don't I don't think they'd care but I also don't think that they notice to be honest
A	yeah
B	they might see it on a table and realise it's not on the bill but I mean by then it'll be too late so
A	yeah
B	what are they gonna do?
A	and that's only if they're like super super observant
B	yeah
A	and actually care if they're jobs worthies then they'll mention it and we'd probably get told off and not to do it again but
B	I don't think it'll matter
A	no
B	but I'm quite happy like if we're going out for a meal I'm quite happy to not get alcohol because I think the meal is my treat
A	yeah
B	and that's what I'm paying for so I think I'm happy to just to have dinner a bit earlier maybe go to Wagamama and then on the way back get a bottle of wine and have it after
A	yeah
B	I think that would that would just be the better thing to do
A	yeah
B	oh I've just realised what a busy few weeks I've got ahead of me obviously on Wednesday I'm going out to Newcastle for the night to see my mum and my nan
A	oh yeah is that this week?
B	yeah Wednesday so I get back on Thursday afternoon and then

A	yeah
B	cos that day session in
A	yeah I love
B	I loved it so much and hopefully we'll be able to meet up with
A	yeah
B	cos we couldn't last time cos he had all of his hockey and a mate coming up and stuff so it was just
A	yeah
B	a bit last minute
A	too much yeah well what I'll have to do in summer before you go we'll have to arrange a day in
B	I I went
A	it is the place that everyone goes
B	I went to
A	mm
B	when we were in England we were at my grandad's we went to
A	yeah
B	that was lovely saw a film being filmed
A	really?
B	yeah well actually more of a series it was like a
A	Game of Thrones
B	no
A	this they film that in
B	do they?
A	yeah
B	oh it wasn't Game of Thrones it was just it was a period drama so I saw women wearing like old
A	oh it'll be like Downton Abbey I bet
B	dresses and stuff
A	that
B	it wasn't Downton Abbey either cos I've I also watched that and it wasn't that
A	you watch Downton Abbey?
B	I watch it with my mum okay? it's a bonding thing
A	okay
B	we watch it over Christmas together
B	well I forced my mum to watch Family Guy which she doesn't enjoy so
A	I watched Family Guy last night
B	my punishment was to watch Downton Abbey with her
A	oh right okay
B	well it wasn't really a punishment cos after I got over how boring it was I actually started to enjoy the storyline
A	yeah
B	I was like oh this is quite interesting what's gonna happen? are they gonna sell the house? oh oh my god they're going bankrupt they're gonna lose the castle I literally got so into it I was like
A	yeah it
B	I I'm ashamed of myself
A	it sounds really boring
B	well it was at first but the storyline is good like there's so much going on like with the servants and up there like one of the servants erm is gay and obviously back then it was
A	no
B	prohibido
A	yeah
B	and erm yeah then like the masters find out and stuff cos he like someone who he's a horrible person and someone tricks him and says that this other guy is in love with him and he wants to arrange a date so he has to go into his bedroom at this time like when everyone's gone to sleep so obviously the gay guy goes in gets into bed with this guy
A	you're joking
B	who's completely straight
A	oh no
B	and he gets fired it was so dramatic
A	really?
B	yeah
A	well even so getting into bed with some random guy or even random girl is bad
B	yeah but obviously
A	let alone being opposite sex
B	he he thought he'd asked for it obviously he thought that he'd arranged the meeting so I felt
A	bless him
B	but he's a horrible character
A	is he?
B	yeah
A	so is he in the show now then or not?
B	mm
A	and were that the end of season one?
B	er it just sort of happened through the season
A	oh okay
B	I don't I haven't watched any more
A	and is er?
B	I watched a bit here and there with
A	yeah
B	so I just watched a few episodes but I'm not I don't follow it
A	mm
B	intensively
A	I couldn't believe it with that our one of our roof tiles just fell off from the storm
B	mm
A	I didn't think it were that bad I mean er it's only a roof tile it's not like it's the whole roof don't get me wrong but still just even that it's like
B	yeah
A	that's never happened it's weird
B	well
A	mm
B	so obviously it's a bit worse but erm their whole fence in his house got blown over
A	really?
B	like the whole fence was just uprooted in the middle of the road and er his mum's house erm she also lives in
A	really?
B	yeah
A	oh god
B	so his mum was just like I'm just so glad it wasn't our house but I feel bad for the other people but I feel happy it's not my house
A	you'd be devastated though wouldn't you?
B	mm
A	it's like it's like all them floods it's like what would you do? like I saw this picture on Facebook earlier basically someone's conservatory doors and the water was up there on the conservatory doors
B	mm
A	and it's just like I can't even imagine that like
B	yeah well do you remember when we had to do that news report in my French seminar? the guy who was the foreign correspondent like down in London
A	yeah yeah
B	above the floods he showed a picture of his friend's house and the water was like up to here
A	really?
B	and there was just it was like a swimming pool inside their house
A	well my uncle's house flooded cos the ones who live er the gay one with his boyfriend
B	yeah
A	erm cos where they live they live just five minutes away from the town centre and basically they
A	to where they live
B	lovely
A	and flooded them instead so it took them two years
B	oh god
A	of living a caravan and hotels for the insurance company to fix everything replace everything
B	it's so horrible isn't it?
A	cos the thing is with water you can't just like
B	yeah
A	and then once that's done then you can start like repairing stuff and fixing stuff and it just took it two years two years it took
B	it's awful
A	and the whole place was just like
B	mm
A	it was so bad
B	I remember years and years ago when I still lived in England
A	yeah
B	and there was a really really bad flood that year I was about five four or five erm so obviously I was really really small
A	yeah
B	but I had to spend the day on my dad's shoulders because the water was up to his waist like
A	really?
B	I would've I would've drowned and I just
A	yeah
B	and all of those were evacuated
A	yeah
B	er
A	you can imagine though bungalows you've only got one floor
B	yeah plus they've all got air vents and stuff like
A	yeah
B	it was horrible like the whole place
A	god
B	there was hundreds of houses in that area
A	it's so bad innit cos it's like the I think the worse thing about it as well for the flood victims is the fact that all the politicians are going over there to like have photo opportunities and they're all safe in their nice little homes away from it and
B	yeah
A	and they're just going in their wellies and like oh wow look at this this is bad innit? and then going back to their nice safe home
B	yes like I'm a part of this
A	yeah
B	but they're not
A	mm they're all sticking their noses in
B	yeah I'm happy we're not in that area though
A	yeah me too it would be like
B	would've been such a hassle
A	well
B	yeah
A	pretty much impossible because because unless you're at the bottom of the hill obviously but because
B	it's not gonna flood
A	sort of thing it's not gonna flood
B	unlikely
A	and even if we do flood we're not gonna flood on
B	yeah we're fine
A	the only
B	we've fine
B	which has actually happened so
A	yeah
A	oh
B	don't tempt fate
A	no let's not touch wood quick touch wood
B	yeah
A	we do not flood
B	was it?
A	cos like I get the reason why we have to do reading and we do like self-study and all this sort of stuff but what I don't understand is them then repeating it in the lecture
B	mm
A	I suppose it's to reiterate and to help us understand more what's being said in the books
B	well do you remember when I had my first lecture this term for my new module?
A	yeah
B	and erm I did the reading before the lecture cos
A	yeah
B	usually I do it before the seminar
A	yeah
B	but I did it before the lecture cos I just had free time and erm it turns out that the lecture like our lecturer had basically just done her lecture based on that chapter of reading
A	right
B	but it was in the same order the same bullet points the same titles like it was literally
A	the same
B	the whole of that chapter in lecture form and I was just like I'm not taking any new information from that like doing that reading didn't help me because the lecture then became pointless
A	yeah
B	and it's actually been the same each time they've based it on the chapter they've given us to read
A	right
B	so I mean I'm still doing the reading cos obviously I do get a bit more information
A	yeah more details
B	and learning personally
[ANNOTATION]	Person B think you can teach your self and reading can be helpful	Neutral
A	yeah
B	yeah like more examples and stuff
A	yeah
B	erm but I find it more helpful to do what our seminar tutor's asked us to do is to like look up media articles
A	yeah
B	erm to sort of put our topics into perspective like internationally
A	yeah oh right okay yeah so
B	if you know what I mean
A	like in practice sort of thing?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	so it's like my topic er for our project is education
[ANNOTATION]	Person B believe that person A is from Pakistan	Contradiction
A	yeah
B	and erm she asked us to find a media article to do with our topic but also the topic of the week
A	right
B	so our topic when I did it last week was gender so I had to find an article that was to do with development and gender and education
A	so you had to find all the all the different examples for the different things
B	yeah and I think that's really good cos it's a lot more challenging because it's really hard to find an article that covers all of it
A	yeah
B	erm I find that really helpful though cos it helps us to get a lot more examples in for our poster
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Person A think that they can get more idea for their poster	Entailment
B	but I'm gonna I'm meeting up with people tomorrow erm I think so far there's three of us that have come back to me
A	right okay
B	out of the five but one of them we've never met so
A	oh yeah it's that guy who got the email innit?
B	basically just the four of is
A	oh
B	and I
[ANNOTATION]	Person B said that just four of the emails have received	Entailment
A	has he not been in touch with any of you as yet?
B	no the our tutor gave all of our emails but I don't know like maybe he's dropped out or something cos I haven't seen him it's actually someone I didn't realise but I've met him before he was in one of my modules the last term
A	yeah
B	for the seminar group erm and it's a guy
A	yeah
B	so that mystery has been solved
A	right
[ANNOTATION]	Person A agrees that they could solve the mistery	Neutral
B	but erm he came into one of the seminars last term and that's it
A	yeah but if he dropped out then it it would have to have a a
B	well we would have been notified as well
A	yeah
B	so I think that he's just not doing anything
A	yeah
B	but that's fine cos I mean it's annoying because he's gonna get the same mark as we do and he's gonna have done none of the work
A	yeah
B	but then I just sort of think well there's four of us
A	it's one less person to organise innit?
B	yeah
A	and if he's really that
B	exactly so I kind of think like the fact that he hasn't got in touch and hasn't come like it doesn't bother me that much cos I'm in a group of people who are quite motivated are quite interested and stuff
A	yeah
B	so I think it's okay but obviously you know I missed that seminar erm last week?
A	yeah
B	well it turns out everyone else did as well like for
A	really?
B	for different reasons and erm one guy went there
A	oh yeah you said cos it were torture like you had to
B	yeah
A	outline what you'd done
B	we had to outline what we'd done so far and obviously we met up once and we've got some information but we haven't gotten a proper structure yet
A	right
B	cos we thought we have until the twenty-fourth of March
A	right
B	erm so
B	erm well if we meet at the old bar I'll buy you a drink
B	and then he was like yeah okay kiddo that might work I was like
A	kiddo?
B	yeah
A	how old is he?
B	erm I think he's quite old
A	oh okay right
B	yeah he's a mature student
A	ah okay
B	like dunno maybe nineteen or twenty
A	and you class that as a mature student
B	well
A	and he's saying kiddo?
B	well you know what I mean it's just a term of endearment
B	cos the first time he text me erm I didn't know who it was cos I hadn't saved any of the numbers like
A	yeah
B	I'd given people my number er
A	but then they'd not text you like saying hi this is
B	exactly so I just got a number off some random person and it got to that point where it was so awkward cos I hadn't asked who it was yet and he was just talking to me and he was like okay pal yeah we'll meet here blah blah blah it's fine don't worry about it and I was like
B	and he was like it's
B	and I was like ah hi
B	I felt so awkward
A	oh dear
B	erm but I like this group
A	really?
B	yeah well there's that guy that I met that one time he was nice
A	yeah
B	but I haven't been since so
A	that's gonna be awkward for you
B	but I mean I'm doing all the reading and I'm doing all the lectures and stuff so like I have information to contribute I'll just work really hard
A	yeah
B	with them in the group
A	well I've gotta catch up four weeks of lectures for my politics
B	mm
A	er or two are we week four?
B	erm
A	yeah we're week four so I've missed three weeks of lectures
B	yeah
A	erm and then I'm going to tomorrow's lecture so I should be fine erm but I'm not gonna be able to go to this seminar group yet cos I've not assigned it so when I
B	yeah
A	drop it in tomorrow the form I'm hoping that I get assigned a seminar group before I miss it
B	well at least there's no group projects for that module
A	yeah no it's just as an exam
B	so at least you're not gonna be dropping in like that
A	yeah the only thing that I've got to do is erm a fifteen hundred word essay in week eight but it's unassessed
B	okay
A	so I think that's just
B	like a practice
A	yeah for the exam
B	that's good though
A	yeah
B	it's like
A	yeah
B	they'll be like if this was assessed you'd get this grade sort of thing
A	yeah if it were in the exam sort of thing
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	and I think that's actually much better cos obviously law's quite hard
A	yeah
B	and it would be really unfair to mark them like from the start
A	yeah
B	do you know what I mean? cos she's on a four year course
A	yeah
B	erm but she's doing quite well
A	really? wow
B	yeah and then she was like damn it why isn't it marked?
B	and then she got like other like a varied mark and she was like I'm actually quite glad none of these are marked now
A	yeah
B	but I think she's doing well
A	yeah that's good
B	which is good and I was really happy to hear about
A	yeah she sounds like it yeah
A	yeah
B	but it's because like in France and stuff erm obviously you have to do every subject there's no choice like for GCSEs and stuff usually you can pick a few subjects that you want to do
A	yeah
B	in France it was all of them just like the Bac
A	yeah you had to do it yeah
B	and erm that meant like all the ones that she wasn't good at and not interested in she still had to do and be like marked in
A	yeah
B	and I just felt really sorry for her cos she struggled
A	it's just it's one of them things as well it's a vicious circle because if you're not if you don't enjoy something and you don't like something then you're not gonna put a lot of effort in but then you get a bad mark in it and you think well why should I
B	yeah
A	it's like a vicious circle innit like
B	exactly and erm before she left France cos she didn't so the Bac she wasn't a college in France she left just after the
A	really?
B	yeah and she did really well I mean she was full on for about two months before our exams
A	yeah
B	and she did well
A	yeah
B	she loves the subject she's good at it it's like psychology and stuff it's what she's good at
A	yeah
B	so I think that's why she's finally happy with her learning environment cos she's finally doing stuff that she's A good at and B enjoys
A	yeah yeah well my friend does that at erm
B	yeah
A	who you've not actually met yet even though she lives in
B	well I still know everything about her
A	yeah I know
A	soon as you meet her it'll be oh so you're
B	it'll be like I know your life story here's mine
A	no she's really nice she's a bit weird but I mean there were this one time
B	so are we though
A	yeah but she's like weird in a different way so this one time erm her friend dies and it was really horrific how he died his brother were drunk and driving like
B	oh no
A	and he was drunk and they had an argument as they were coming off the hard
B	oh no
A	the driver didn't die but his brother did and his brother had just had a baby and
B	oh god
A	and like it were awful and erm
B	I can imagine
A	and cos it were one of her close friends erm and that like a few nights after it happened we went out drinking like summer barbecue then went out around town and stuff erm and she were really drunk and she started talking to people that weren't there like we were waiting for the taxi and she was stood talking to this guy called
B	oh my god
A	and it was really freaky it were just like
B	yeah
A	like you know
B	that is strange
A	and like she were really upset about it all night and I were and I were just like I didn't know whether he were a really close friend or she just considered him a
B	yeah
A	but
B	horrible when you're in control like you're sober or you're okay and someone else is completely off their face because you sort of see things differently
A	yeah
B	like if there are two of you and you're both really really drunk you're in the same boat
A	yeah
B	but if one of them's really drunk and doing weird things
A	yeah
B	you notice it
A	yeah
B	it's like sometimes when erm I'm with
A	yeah
B	ah I get really I'm I like fear for him cos I know that he's fine but because I'm seeing him high
A	from a sober point of view
A	yeah
B	like when we were at
A	it doesn't matter
B	he gets like solid stuff which is
A	yeah
B	not as strong as like actual
A	yeah it's different yeah
B	green weed
A	yeah
B	and erm it was the first time he'd actually had it this summer
A	yeah
B	like the first time ever and he just went really weird on it like he had a coughing fit and I thought that he was like dying I was really worried and
A	yeah
B	then he started laughing by himself and he was just leaning on a post and like laughing like talking to himself and I was like he's obviously having a nice time
B	but I am really really scared right now
B	I was just like are you okay? are you okay yeah? shall I take you home? yeah let let let's let's go home
A	let's go home
B	you need to sleep this off really bad
B	but it's so pretty
A	it is so pretty they're ten pound each them
B	I love them
A	from erm Debenhams John Rocher I was like ten pound?
B	I like it
A	like
B	I can get two
A	ten pound? well I got three
A	he made me buy three and he were like buy three and like
B	yeah but they wouldn't last as long
A	well no but
B	and the gems would fall out after a day
A	well I'm only wearing them once
B	yeah
A	I'm I've not really worn them again properly cos they ruin everything that I own
A	but
B	yeah
A	I'm really good actually cos erm
B	is it that that Topshop one you were telling me about?
A	yeah it's that Topshop one and it were it weren't expensive but I can't find it anywhere
B	have you lent it to someone?
A	and no I haven't because
B	have you like maybe accidentally left it somewhere?
A	no and I think what has happened is because it's a smaller dress than what I would usually buy I think that
B	oh
A	and has sent it to her by accident
B	yeah
A	and she's just thought it was something she forgot she had or someone else's
B	yeah that's possible
A	and I'm like I told
B	just just
B	yeah just chase up on it a little bit
A	but I'm gutted though cos it was such a nice dress like it I love that dress it like I'd wear it on a day to day basis like I just met my mate for a drink I'd just put that on
B	yeah
A	and it was summer so I didn't wear tights but like I'd wear tights with my Converse with it or my Uggs and it just
B	yeah
A	looked really nice it were just one of them casual things you could er wear it on a night out or you could wear it through the day and I just loved it
B	yeah I
A	and now I'm gutted
B	fell in love I've fallen in love with a type of
A	yeah
B	so it's like straight up straight down
A	yeah
B	and it's completely plain but I found one in Topshop that I fell in love with but I couldn't justify paying thirty pounds for it just cos it came from Topshop
A	yeah
B	but then the ones in New Look and Primark and everywhere else that I looked they just weren't nice
A	yeah
B	like obviously Topshop they'd put the effort in to make the sizes right to make it nice
A	yeah
B	that's why it's expensive
A	yeah
B	but I I really couldn't justify it like paying all that
A	how much did the other dress cost though? twenty-seven?
B	twenty-seven
A	so it were only three pound more
B	yeah but
A	no
B	do you know what I mean?
A	yeah
B	it's got a pattern it's nice it's something I could wear casual and something I can dress up
A	yeah
B	and obviously Primark's one erm the Topshop I know it will last long
A	yeah
B	but I know that I get my money's worth when I go there
A	yeah
B	that's why I don't go very often
B	it's the first time I've been since I've moved here
A	yeah it's really expensive
B	I'm very proud of myself
A	I don't I don't like the
B	cos I have an addiction to Topshop so
A	I I don't like the Topshop in
B	yeah
A	like it's not all glittery and fancy like it is in there like the one in
B	have you been to the one in the
A	I don't know
B	I think there's three I know there's one in town somewhere that's massive like giant I went there with my dad
A	yeah
B	when I came for the open day
A	oh yeah it's the erm it's the one in the er new centre the new shopping centre innit?
B	the
A	is that what the new centre's called?
B	yeah
A	I think it's the
B	oh cos that's the first time I'd been there and I like that one
A	yeah
B	but it's on three floors but it's all relatively well organised
A	yeah well I went with
B	yeah
A	sort of thing
B	but there's also
A	so
B	a small one erm I can't remember what centre it's called but it's the one
A	the
B	I don't I honestly don't know it's really small
A	yeah
B	erm it's where do you remember we went into Dorothy Perkins and you got that top?
A	oh yeah it's on that road
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	there's there's a small Topshop in that centre and then a massive massive one further in town and then a new one in the
A	right yeah I've been to I think cos the one in
B	yeah
A	and there's like three floors
B	it
A	yeah yeah
B	but I liked it there
A	yeah I know which one
B	I found so much stuff that I like cos erm Topshop like it's really hit and miss cos it's style a lot I used to love it
A	yeah
B	but now it's all like really weird stuff
A	it's hipster innit?
B	yeah
A	it's like really
B	yeah
A	really fashionable
B	like vibrant colours and
A	yeah
B	just stuff that I don't particularly like so find it really hit and miss when I go in there but
A	yeah I do
B	generally I do find stuff that I fall in love with
A	yeah I generally like I only go to Topshop for my jeans I don't like buying dresses and stuff from there because
B	mm
A	the sizing for me is wrong
B	oh yeah
A	because my boobs and my bum it just takes into consideration if you're small and skinny
B	yeah
A	you know it like if I buy a size ten in there which I am a size ten like because of the size of my boobs it just does not look right or does not fit right
B	yeah
A	so I have to get the next size up but then it fits over my boobs but then everywhere else is baggy and it's just like well I'm not paying this much money for something that doesn't fit me how I want it to fit me even
B	yeah
A	you know
B	but I think that's why I like Topshop is they have a petite range
A	yeah
B	so like I can get a size eight and it will be a size eight for small people
A	yeah
B	because they have a tall section as well but the normal if I buy a size eight like skirt or something it will just be a bit too long like look a bit wrong
A	yeah
B	and then I go into the petite section and it's the same size that fits like the same but it's just made shorter
A	yeah
B	obviously for small people
A	yeah
B	that's where I got my dress when I got it from the petite section
A	did you?
B	because I originally picked one up from normal
A	yeah
B	and it was just too long like it went over my knees and it was a
A	yeah a bit too conservative
B	it's a body-con one so it's supposed to like
A	yeah
B	and it just wasn't
A	yeah
B	and then
A	ah
B	it was nice but I like that that they have the petite range
A	yeah it's they have a tall range don't they as well
B	yeah
A	which I think is good like for me personally cos my jeans when I go to the normal I can't get jeans in there that fit me
B	yeah
A	because I like wearing my jeans quite high waisted as well
B	yeah
A	so because I'm tall I don't they just don't look right
B	yeah
A	and they end up being like ankle grazers and I don't want ankle grazers I want them to go over my ankle
B	yeah
B	but that's why I love Topshop because you can get a different sized waist plus different size leg
A	yeah I love that
B	whereas normal jeans it's like a size eight is this long and I have to fold up all of my jeans
A	yeah
B	because I'm like I'm small but I'm a size eight so please
A	yeah
B	fix that
B	well now I'm a size ten which is even longer
A	yeah they are long yeah
B	but at least now I can get like waist whatever like
A	yeah waists whatever leg whatever
B	and the leg like for it's
A	yeah
B	a twenty-six like a size four
A	is that it?
B	because I'm short
A	oh my god
B	yeah literally
A	I'm a size thirty-three in leg
B	I think I'm like a twenty-eight
A	like long leg
A	or whatever
unknown_female	hey mate
A	hi
B	hello
unknown_female	you alright?
A	yeah are you?
unknown_female	yeah good
A	oh baguettes
unknown_female	mm
B	mm bread
A	that I
B	oh my god I forgot to tell you the other night it was Friday night and we'd just gotten back from
A	yeah
B	just chatting and getting ready for sleep and stuff and then someone opened my door without asking like without knocking or anything like yo
B	and like I know that I hadn't been loud cos we were talking we were whispering we weren't drunk at all so I know we hadn't woken them up I was just like
A	yeah
B	what are they doing? like I could have been asleep right now
A	could have been naked you could have just got out of the shower or anything
B	but I don't I didn't recognise the voice it was really weird
A	yeah cos then you know their voices don't you?
B	yeah and it I don't think it was
A	yeah
B	it's quite distinctive I was just like who is this person? it's really weird
A	erm sorry erm how did it go at the office have you got everything that you need?
unknown_female	er yeah just fucking annoying
A	why?
unknown_female	well I only had time to get there and back and that's all I done
A	really?
unknown_female	yeah
A	well how how long have you been gone?
unknown_female	er an hour and a bit just to drive there and back
A	really? that's stupid
unknown_female	yeah
A	mm
unknown_female	and then my fucking phone just the data just disappeared so I needed the sat nav to go somewhere somewhere else and it just died it just won't come back on so fuck knows anyway I'm gonna go and cook some food
A	yeah alright then well well just wait two minutes and I'll come and do it
unknown_female	no I just wanna start it myself alright
A	right alright then
unknown_female	you can join me whenever you're ready
A	alright bye
unknown_female	bye then
A	erm
B	mm
A	like it only happened three or four times but
B	yeah
A	or like they'd like push my door open and run away or whatever and that's why now every time I go to bed I lock the door
B	yeah
A	like
B	well one night a few weeks ago everyone was pre-drinking in our flat and I was just on Skype to
A	yeah
B	and then I just heard a girl like running down the corridor like backwards and forwards and she was screaming and she was like let's check whose doors are open and I was like
A	yeah
B	pissing me off
A	yeah
B	and they were just like oh calm down calm down and he was like get out and I was just like that's so rude at midnight he wasn't going out he could have been asleep for all they all they know
A	yeah
B	it's like why do people do that and why do they think that's okay?
A	it's cos it's all their friends like this is
B	so immature
A	the all of them are just so rude and immature it's none of them have been away from home they you know they're all so immature that they don't know how to act around people
B	mm
A	and they think it's okay that you can just go and do that well actually no it's not and that's why I lock my door and I had a go at
B	it's not funny
A	respect and nuance about you and you know
B	I just don't understand how people can do that like if you're drunk fair enough sometimes you don't realise what you're doing but even when I'm drunk I still what's right and what's wrong
A	I will never go and like do that unless it like your door and I knew you'd been out
B	but you'd still knock
A	I'd still knock I wouldn't just walk in
B	no
A	it's just so rude like I don't understand why all them are so rude like I've never known anything like it
B	he was like he used to
A	like
B	walk into my bedroom in the middle of the night and I'm like
A	and get in bed with you as well like that time he got in bed with me and you when we
B	mm
A	invited you in why are you here?
B	but I did start locking my doors after that but then I stopped because I was just like I'll lock my door when I want privacy and stuff but I'm like this is my flat too I shouldn't have to lock myself in my bedroom like
A	mm
B	just to feel like I can have some private space
A	yeah
B	and like ever since we have put boundaries down with them lot and we've stopped hanging out with them like it doesn't generally happen
A	yeah
B	so I leave it unlocked cos I just think in case of a fire or something
A	yeah
B	it's just a bit safer
A	yeah no it's just so inconsiderate innit it's just like what are you doing really come on
