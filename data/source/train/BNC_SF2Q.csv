B	and it's now recording see
C	yeah
B	probably dried up our conversation
A	yeah
B	hasn't it?
C	what about
A	oh that was when we were in the pub it was a bit like one of them programs where house finding things?
B	oh right yeah
A	that's
B	oh I see
A	and he's going down to the pub and oh oh  no signal  no signal
B	did they? Yeah
A	yeah and they're only talking about the odd
B	oh right
A	and they said no it can't do any more no no
C	mm
A	I mean it was already a load above the limit
B	yeah
A	and um and then they said okay so they're basically
B	going through the motions
A	going through with it
C	oh
A	but it's a house it's in a  it's in a  a road a street in Brockley which is sort of south London sort of half way between Peckham and Greenwich
B	oh right yeah
A	they're not that far from the river
B	no
A	but it's on on the sort of I think it's the sort of near where the south
B	is it? Right
A	I think it's the south
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	is that right?
B	yeah so it is right
C	mm
A	yeah well whichever
B	yeah I'm sure it was Greenwich
A	mm
B	yeah
A	anyway and uh it's a sort of street houses which are late Victorian
B	yeah
A	and they were you know quite pretty pretty houses
C	oh
A	A bit like College Road isn't it?
B	oh right
A	and um
C	got bay windows as well?
A	I think yeah
C	that's nice
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	mm
A	but hers is not one of them
B	I thought it was a
A	knocked a hole in the the
C	oh dear
A	you know it looks like the council came in and built just these brick prison block type houses
B	oh right
C	oh
A	yeah as in infill
C	yeah
A	and it's funny cos the houses are like twice as wide as a normal house
C	mm
A	and divided in to a flat's length width wise you know?
B	oh are they?
A	so the bottom flat is a you know what I mean?
B	yeah
A	yeah normally the houses is sort of one room and a hall way going up aren't they?
B	that's right
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A lives in one of the houses they are speaking about	Neutral
A	going up the stairs and then there's one room and then the little room
C	right
B	yeah
A	well this is like one room and one room
C	yeah
A	and you know bedroom and that sort of
B	yeah
A	two bedroom built that way and then that's there's a doorway there and you go up the stairs and a corridor and then there's sort of like
B	another
A	you know
B	yeah
A	yeah so it's quite a lot of room
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	The house is not spacious	Contradiction
A	there's about as much room in it as you would in a terraced house
B	oh really?
C	mm
A	and then because that's sort of double width like the gardens are split down the middle and the bottom half of one bit of the garden
B	oh that's the other bit
A	so they've got a garden there
[ANNOTATION]	The house has a garden	Entailment
C	yeah
A	and a sort of a a balcony door where you go out and down the steps
B	oh
A	to get to your garden
[ANNOTATION]	The balcony has space for a dining table	Neutral
B	oh I see yeah
A	so you know I mean it's it's quite nice except that when it was built you know they they you know it's
B	they just
A	had absolutely no um interest in blending in with the street
B	no
A	and of course they they've got all the blooming drainage pipes and stuff
B	all hanging oh god
A	all going down in front of the house
[ANNOTATION]	The house stands out in the neighbourhood	Entailment
B	yeah
A	so when you look at the front all you see is like the the um the the loo pipe
B	yeah
A	you know with all the branches going off to the kitchen sink and the
C	mm
A	hand basins and things like this
B	right
A	you know what I mean? It just looks so tatty
B	yeah
A	and they're all done in black
B	they're Fletton bricks as well are they?
A	yeah it looks like a Fletton bricks
B	yeah
A	I mean you know it just looks
B	yeah
A	so the water had been running down the front and and staining the brick wall
B	yeah
A	so the brick work's all sort of stained at the front
B	looks nice yeah?
A	well there's no
B	what for? Two bedroom? Is it two bedroom?
A	it is yeah it is
C	in that area
C	two bedroom
C	is it on the street?
B	four hundred thousand
C	three hundred?
A	no
B	two hundred and sixty
A	I mean there's
C	they're only working
A	the thing is there's nothing you can't get a house for or
B	yeah
A	near
B	yeah?
A	whatever it's called um Burnley
B	oh
A	which is you know he could like you said he could cycle there in fifteen minutes to work
B	brilliant
A	you know he could
C	mm
A	but anyway they they like it but they'll have to pay seven thousand five hundred pounds stamp duty
C	yeah
B	oh what?
C	it's ever so stressful
A	that is a bit
B	yeah
A	you know towards the deposit
B	that is a lot of money
A	you know
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	and I'll scratch around and I think well you know help her out you know cos I mean they are expensive places and uh you know
C	yeah
A	that just goes bonk straight to the government
B	yeah
C	yeah
C	yeah
B	it makes you sick doesn't it?
A	yeah I mean
B	oh why they  why they  do this I
A	but I mean that's a terrible tax for
C	yeah
A	people who haven't got much money
B	we'll it is it's just
A	Cos like both of them
B	first time buyers
C	but they changed it again lately haven't they?
B	yeah they they are
C	to what?
A	they're now they did have it so that first time buyers didn't have to pay it
C	oh I see
A	there you are that don't work we'll get rid of that as well
B	yeah
A	now they do have to have it
C	yeah
A	but I mean when you get two
C	mm
B	no?
A	about you know sort of you know the sort of young couple you know trying to start a family get a house together they got student loans to pay back
B	yeah
A	do you know what I mean?
C	yeah it's awful
B	and then council tax on top of it
C	nothing
A	and then you got council tax and then you get
C	yeah
A	blooming hammered for tax like that
B	yeah
A	whereas if you're rich you'd buy it through an offshore company you wouldn't pay anything
B	you wouldn't pay anything no
A	you know I mean there's people buying fifteen million pound houses
B	yeah
A	in London not paying anything
B	yeah
C	why don't they pay tax?
B	well cos they get
A	they they have a
C	oh I see
A	in in Cayman Islands and that company buys the house and then they
C	okay
A	buy it off them and they don't pay any tax
B	which they're trying to block up
A	well they are but as soon as they've blocked one thing and it's another thing open
B	there's another one opening
C	yeah
B	how money works
C	that's right
A	well it's this thing you know I mean
B	like they can get around everything
A	yeah I mean you can employ an account for fifty grand a year and they can save you like five million
B	yeah
A	that's right
B	yeah
A	you know so
B	well we can employ a employ an accountant and he'll rip you off
C	yeah
B	totally ripped off like like
C	mm
B	got totally ripped off by his
A	really the accountant?
B	yeah
A	what? He
B	he did all the work right? You do all the work
A	yeah
C	you have to do all the work
B	and you sack people who
A	was this a tax accountant?
B	yeah
A	mm
B	and he charge
A	and put them in the proper place on the form
B	well yeah
A	yeah
C	mm
B	and then he charge an enormous amount of money won't he?
C	yeah
A	mm
B	and that didn't cost anything did it?
C	yeah kept telling him don't do your own
A	that's what I hope yeah
C	if you're gonna do all of the filing and that
A	I don't
B	yeah
A	and as long as you got all the figures which is the hard bit
B	yeah
A	getting all the figures together
B	that's right yeah
A	you know I mean uh
B	and then they got to balance haven't they? You know
A	you just start fill the numbers in push the button
B	yeah
A	overpaid tax
C	I tried it online but every time
B	oh yes I mean it's
C	you have to register don't you? They give you a number and then
A	that's right
C	every time I put the number in or whatever they gave you
B	it went wrong there
C	yeah
A	oh really?
B	yeah
C	I gave up
B	mm
C	did it twice like that
B	yeah now there's no need to do it any more so
C	well I've got one more to do
A	well there could be you see you know just cos you're
B	well
A	not earning
B	did I  Did I  hear it right? That they're going to tax pensions at source?
A	no
B	surely that em
A	no
B	he said no won't it?
A	no cos it
B	well this is what Clegg was talking about there should be
A	no no no no no no
B	oh right yours is a private pension isn't it?
A	not state pensions
C	mm
A	see it's it's the thing is about private pensions right?
B	yeah
A	is that your state pension uses up not all your personal allowance but most of it
B	yeah
A	so anything you get on top of that is taxed
B	taxed yeah
A	at twenty percent
B	yeah
A	so what they're saying is that instead of them paying you
B	oh I see
A	but I think
C	instead of telling you cos
A	I think
B	is it? Yeah
A	yes it is
C	ours wasn't
B	no
C	Cos we
B	no we didn't no
C	but we took it lump sum and then
B	and lost a thousand pounds
C	then got a yeah
A	yeah um
B	I should have asked for advice
A	when you're meddling within you don't have to go out
B	well that's true
C	we should have done yeah
A	but the um yeah I mean
C	but I'm not sure if it's taken away first isn't it?
A	well
C	then you don't know how much you can take
A	well that's right I mean the thing is
C	you might as well if you
B	yeah
C	they give you a horrible bills
A	yeah that's right but you see there's this thing that most people don't want to do a tax return do they?
B	no they don't
A	but theoretically if you've got a state pension and a private pension you really should do a tax return
B	yeah
A	because there's all sorts of you know things that you could get money back
B	money back for
A	and uh cos you forever reading the fact that um you know these people these pension companies that are getting your codes wrong you know what I mean?
B	yeah
C	mm
B	so they're taking off a lot more than they should be doing
B	true
A	and stuff like this and people never bother to at the end of the year you know
B	check up on them
A	just check up
B	yeah
A	whereas in fact if you did a tax return you know you get exactly
C	mm
A	you know everything comes out in the wash
B	that's right
C	yeah
A	you know I mean whether you paid too much or whatever or who paid what and blah blah blah it all comes out in the wash you know
C	mm
A	yeah it sorts itself out
C	mm
B	but I I
C	they couldn't possibly tax your state pension cos you're under the earnings anyway aren't you since
A	no it's well outside
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	that's right you under the earning
C	yeah
B	but if you did earn would they take it off at the source then? If you
A	and if you were working
C	but no it would be taken off your work
A	if you it would be taken off your work
B	yeah but if you're self-employed you'd send a tax form in wouldn't you?
A	you'd have to
B	yeah
A	ah but if you worked and drew your pension that in that case it should be taxed at source
C	mm
A	couldn't
B	yeah
A	you know what I mean?
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	because you got your tax allowance on your
B	on your
A	on your PAYE on where you're working
B	that's right
A	and then comes in extra doesn't it?
B	yeah
A	so it should be taxed at source
B	yeah
A	but I mean  I mean  how many people
C	you're allowed to earn
A	does that affect?
C	like four thousand aren't you? Including your pension something like that
A	when you're at the moment when you're sixty-five your tax code is something like nine five something
B	mm hm
C	yeah
A	which means you can earn nine thousand quid
C	mm
B	yeah
A	and your pension is what? Seven thousand or something like that?
B	yeah
A	for an individual
C	that's including that isn't it?
B	yeah
A	right
B	before you hit tax
A	before you even start paying tax
C	mm
A	but that was the other thing is they were saying that that at the moment you know when you're sixty-five you know because before your personal allowance was six thousand seven hundred
B	yeah
A	and when you're sixty-five it was nine thousand right?
C	right
A	you know to allow for that thing
B	yeah
A	you know that you keep more of your money
B	yeah
A	but now the personal taxing is eight thousand six hundred but they haven't put up the nine thousand whatever it was for
B	for the pension
A	for the pensioners
B	yeah
A	so a lot of pensioners are saying oh you know we're losing out
B	no you're not gaining
A	you know what I mean?
B	yeah
A	then all these arguments our pension is losing out it means they're not really losing out they're not just gaining as much as they had in the past
B	no that's right
C	mm
B	yeah
A	and you know
B	all these
A	it is
B	ways are all these ways that you can what what they don't call fiddling tax but evading tax is it
A	mm
B	is it
A	well there's what arethe two terms
B	tax evasion
A	evasion and one is
B	tax avoidance
A	avoidance
B	one is legal and one is yeah
A	Cos it is a it's a basic rule with anything with uh tax or anything like that
B	yeah
A	then you're quite within your rights to use it
B	of course you are yeah
A	you know and that's until they close the loophole of course
B	yeah
A	which is what's happening
B	yeah
A	and to not tax the rich people
B	that's right yeah
A	or not as much
C	yes
A	but nowadays you see you're getting more and more people jumping over from being poor to being rich
B	yeah
A	and these people are exploiting every loophole they can find
B	they can get
A	and other people are then seeing it and they are trying it as well
B	yeah
C	mm
A	did you see that Amazon
B	yes
A	paid something like three million tax in three years or something like that
C	yeah
A	after making a billion a year or something
B	A billion a year yeah
C	mm
A	Cos they're registered in Luxembourg
C	ah I see
A	then they've got an office in Luxembourg with about a hundred and fifty people in it
C	ah
A	and all the money goes there
B	yeah
A	and so it's not
C	yeah
A	but I mean on the other hand they do employ thousands of people in this company
B	oh yeah that is a point
A	they're paying PAYE
B	but
A	and all them drivers as well packers and drivers and
B	yeah and there's lots of companies
A	and they putting a lot of people out of business you know
B	lots of companies registered with in Ireland as well
A	Ireland that's Microsoft oh no Apple
B	apple yeah
A	apple are registered in Ireland
B	and Sony
A	that's right yeah cos they only pay ten per cent taxes out of the twenty-six per cent
B	yeah
C	mm
A	but this is one of these things like when Ireland was well is sort of basically bankrupt but that's only half the story because these other big companies which officially have got massive exports
B	yeah
A	from Ireland
C	mm
B	yeah
A	but it's always a global citizen it's getting  it's getting  um so that countries don't actually mean much any more
B	that's right
A	when it comes to finance
B	yeah
A	really
B	yeah
A	and that's why VAT keeps going up
B	twenty per cent
A	because you know you can't avoid paying that there's no well
C	mm
A	you can if you're a foreigner
B	yeah
A	yeah that as well but I mean that's a business thing but maybe
B	yeah
A	if you go to the West End and buy anything and show them your passport your foreign passport
B	oh right
A	you can get it VAT free
B	is that why all these people get foreign passports?
C	no
A	but you see it's but then when you go out into your country
C	mm
A	you have to declare it and pay
B	pay custom tax
A	custom duties you see
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	or if you're like me you buy something in this country full price go to Germany and then pay it blooming again
B	that happened to you did it? Oh dear
A	I went there one Christmas right
B	yeah
A	sort of stacking system
B	yeah
A	and they pulled me in and checked the boot
B	wow
C	mm
A	and I said well hang on it's of personal use I'm going to take it out in eighteen months' time
C	mm
A	you know free or whatever it was
B	mm
A	so you got to pay on this other bit
C	oh
A	I mean it was really annoying
B	yeah
C	oh
A	we're still part of the common we're still in the common market
C	right
A	but the rules hadn't changed
B	yeah
A	and then
C	mm
A	but if you went to America for instance
C	mm
A	or if you went to America and bought a load of stuff and tried to bring it back then you'd have to pay
B	yeah
A	duty on it
B	yeah
C	right
A	I think they allow you something like
C	so it's not that cheap after all?
A	fifty quid is it?
C	yeah
B	no
A	Cos that's the same if you buy something on e-bay from America
B	yeah you have to pay for that
A	if it's cheap you're alright but if it's anything out you know
C	mm
A	you pay a whacking great lump sum of duty
C	oh
B	and they make you pay it before you get it anyway so
A	they do
C	mm
B	so there's no paying it
C	mm
B	yeah
A	went funny
B	before
A	more
B	it's more isn't it?
A	yeah
B	where do you think he went
A	has he?
B	yeah they now transferred him
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	well yes I I have heard that because he wants to be like Ireland
B	yeah
A	you know put down corporation tax there
B	that's right
A	this idea of these rich people was if you don't charge any tax you get more in the end you know
B	yeah
A	it's the same idea about you know when they reduced the fifty P tax
B	yeah
A	they said oh well you know there's so much avoidance that you don't get any money in any way
B	forty-five P
A	and you think well how come if it's not making any money and everyone's avoiding it is there such a has everyone up in the air about it
B	yeah
A	if you're not paying it why worry
C	mm
A	but you know it's just lies
B	that's it
A	was it the railways?
B	the railways yeah
A	well no the roads
B	roads that's right
C	the roads
A	he said no we'll get the Chinese government to buy all the roads in Britain
B	buy all our roads in Britain
C	what a stupid
A	and you think honestly you know I mean they're sold
C	yeah
A	like all the utility well nearly all the utilities
B	everything is gone
A	are in foreign hands aren't they?
C	yeah
B	everything is gone
A	yeah
B	conglomerates
C	mm
A	that's right
B	and Anglia Water I think belongs to some French company
A	I think Anglia Water is still Anglia Water actually
B	is it? I thought
C	electricity is French
B	the electricity is French
A	there's a lot of  there's a lot of  electric that belongs to Germany
B	yeah EDF that's the one
A	and they sort of a lot of other companies as well
C	mm
A	but I mean like things like Thames Water belongs to Singapore doesn't it? Or something
B	is it Singapore is it?
A	somewhere like that and then you get the Canadian Teachers Pension Fund own god knows what you know
B	God that's
A	I mean it's amazing but I mean the thing is is that when they say it doesn't matter but when push come to shove you can't put any pressure on these people
B	no you can't
A	to do anything
B	no
A	like you could if it was a government owned
B	that's right yeah
A	anything that is government owned I mean you eventually you kick up such a fuss that they do something about things
B	yeah
A	but if it's some Singapore economic growth fund owns it you know all they're thinking about is the bottom line
B	that's right
A	we can push this up and make more profit
B	more money yeah
A	but it is bit like you know this sort of so called hose pipe ban and how they're so short of water are they're sort of pleading so everyone will got to use less water and stuff like that
B	yeah
A	I mean at the back of my house they're building four massive great houses right?
B	yeah
C	mm
A	when they're built there's gonna be four families in there
B	yeah
A	using water which is not being used now
B	yeah
A	where is that coming from if there's a shortage of water?
B	that's right
C	mm
B	yeah
A	then why should I bother to save any water?
B	yeah
A	I mean I pay for every drop I use
B	so do we
C	mm
B	we do
C	so will these new houses be on on a metre?
B	yeah every every house has got
A	no there are houses but everyone we know is on metre
C	yeah
A	so much so that everyone's got uh be careful how they use it how come they can get permission to have four more four new people
B	that's right
C	mm
A	just like that? And it's not just that
C	mm
A	is it? They're talking about seven hundred houses in
B	that's right yeah
A	you know
B	there's a couple of places going up
C	I don't know
A	well
B	yeah
A	there's a bit in the paper the other day about how
A	they'd sort of the council was selling off a hundred and sixty-seven
B	yeah
A	acres or something like that to finish up
B	oh that's right
A	and we aren't going to have any recreation grounds you know they just
B	yeah
A	cut it right down and do sort of
C	mm
A	slums or anything
B	yeah slums
C	yeah
B	modern slums
C	yeah
B	just like what  was
A	yeah
B	modern slums
C	which has never ever been to go to play it just
A	well that  Estate that's you know that was a really good chance to do something
B	no
A	nice
B	yes it was
A	and they just built
B	they just chuck stuff up
C	mm
A	they just and like yeah
B	too far apart
A	yeah
B	you can open you can't open round some of these places
A	yeah
B	because they'll knock into next door
A	that's right
C	mm
A	when it's a well-known fact that you put rats in a
B	and they eat each other
A	and they just go mad don't they?
B	yeah
C	mm
A	I mean everyone needs a bit of space around them
C	yeah
B	you do
C	yeah
A	mind you the worst ones are them ones you know where the hospital is?
A	you know that road they put through to the A11?
B	oh yeah
A	and there's an estate off there isn't it?
B	there is I haven't seen the estate
C	yeah
A	oh in no them places are just so close together
B	yeah
A	it's like they've built the roads and like it's sort of the standard width of a road
B	yeah
A	or there's a standard width of a car and they make it twice as big
B	the least they can do is sixteen foot I think
A	yeah but the roads there they're probably it seems like they're sort of we'll save money we'll just build fourteen foot
B	yeah
A	no one will notice
B	that's like they did
A	and like all the houses in there
C	yeah
A	they're just crammed together
B	yeah
C	I don't know
B	they were going about thirty-five or something
A	oh really?
B	right
C	yeah
B	without telling the without telling anyone
A	really?
B	and do you know how they got
A	did they not get found out?
B	they did
A	mm
B	if anyone parked in that road nothing can get passed
C	yeah
B	right? Nothing
A	uh huh
B	now how the hell are they gonna push the push chair or the pram down the things? They got to walk in the road
A	but this is very
C	and all the garages
B	and the garages
C	you can get the car in yes but you can't get out
B	yet you can't get you can't open the door
C	so no one uses them
A	well in down this estate I was telling you about
B	yeah
A	you know they build these roads and they have like a little spur road go off with a cul de sac and a turning bay at the bottom
B	that's fairly it
A	you know to stop sort of through traffic
B	yeah
A	I suppose to make it more friendly
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	and it's actually painted on the foot path which leaves
C	is it really?
A	yeah
C	oh gosh
A	it's marked on the footpath so you have to park half and half
C	yeah
A	so it leaves like you're saying a bit of a that wide
B	yeah
A	to walk along there
C	mm
A	and these houses are shoe horned in
B	yeah
A	you know those sort of houses where and we visited someone who lived there and here's your front door
C	mm
B	yeah
A	there's little narrow flights of stairs going up
B	yeah
A	you know like there it's hardly enough space to actually
C	mm
A	get in at the door before you hit the stairs
B	yeah
A	and they go boom narrow
B	that's fine
A	a little flat it seems okay
C	yeah
A	but it's like all the houses are so crammed in
B	yeah
A	where they have like three bedroomed houses two bedroom houses flats maisonettes
B	yeah
A	all crammed in together

B	prefab concrete and that's that's how Marpit estate is built with these
C	mm
B	prefabricated concrete walls
C	mm
B	with no actual ventilation at all
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	they were just cowboys put them up and missed that all the
B	missed out what they were supposed to do
A	all the you know proper factors
B	yeah
A	Cos I mean they were so easy to bolt together that I just go crazy earn huge
B	that's right
A	walk away
B	and that
A	mm but they were making concrete beams and stuff for a long while afterwards
B	yeah they did
A	mm
A	oh yeah I'd had an accident for the
C	mm
B	I got a ticket from the hospital to say I cannot do any heavy work with a green ticket that was
A	mm hm

A	they don't change do they?
B	no
A	these dole places you know they they're still doing the same old thing
B	I weren't on the dole long
C	I think they're they are a bit better than they used to be aren't they?
B	yeah
A	I don't think so
C	mm
B	no
A	yes
B	they don't care who you are
A	mm
B	and I put my best suit on
A	mm hm
B	with my tie and uh jacket and I went up there and and the bloke he said
A	I'm looking for management
C	yeah
B	look cos I had to go for this interview
C	that's what you have to say isn't it?
B	to be sent to Birmingham for a course on getting back to work or something like that
A	right
B	and he looked at me and he said do you know you're the first person ever to have come ever that he's seen to come in clean shaven with a suit on
A	so he marked your name mentally unstable
B	and then he said  then he said  I don't know why they've uh sent you to me because you've got three children and you've got to be home with your children cos nobody else was there
A	yeah
B	but somebody had said I've got to go to this do you know
A	yeah I know they're sending
C	mm
A	people in wheelchairs aren't they?
B	yeah
A	with heart disease and god knows what
B	yeah
A	I feel quite lucky I missed it all out by a few years
B	you did didn't you?
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	mm
B	yeah
A	they had me working I tell you they'd have me going running round in circles
B	they would yeah
C	mm
B	but they had
A	mm
B	and he couldn't fill his kettle up properly you know without all this other without
A	yeah
B	all this help
A	yeah
B	that he get from social services
A	yeah
B	from
A	mm hm
B	and do things
A	mm hm
B	you know some terrible job
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	they cut the money off and then they say well we're sort it out and then it takes like
B	six months
A	six months to sort it out
B	yeah
A	these people are supposed to live with no money
B	that's right
A	for six months?
B	yeah
C	mm
B	yeah
A	I mean the trouble is that every time you read a story like that the next page you read about someone who's you know written some got a  got a got a  got a house  got a house  in Spain and five alias' which are all claiming money off off the dole
B	oh there's a program on television called Rip Off Britain
A	something like that
B	and uh this bloke that got thirty thousand quid from social services
C	mm
B	and he'd got two or three passports
A	mm
C	yeah claiming for all these different things
B	and he'd claim for all these different things
C	mm
B	and he was claiming house allowance which he owned the house he was living in
A	mm hm
B	and he was letting the house out
A	mm
B	to to other people
C	yeah cos he'd got all these different addresses as well
B	yeah
C	all these houses
A	but the other trick they used to do was like they used to have like kids you know
B	yeah
A	and they'd lend the kids to the people who go with them and say I got five kids
A	and then the kids
A	and they can then they're was some complaint because they were finger printing children
B	yeah
A	and you know to keep the check
B	civil yeah civil rights you can't do that
A	but I mean that there was that people
B	oh yes yes
A	with an office
B	yeah
A	and they sort of uh when they busted them they had to sort of break into this secret room and this room was an office right?
C	mm
A	and they had like all the paperwork like thirty different passports
B	that's right
C	oh right?
A	and all the papers and stuff and everyone
B	yeah
A	you know they were just claiming left right and centre from everyone weren't they?
C	mm
A	and loads of cheques coming in all over the place
B	all over the place yeah
A	it's what made me think
C	yeah
A	you know and you think that the social services would be able to check up on something like that
B	of course she would
C	she would
B	what's going on
A	what if it had been well I mean
C	yeah
A	nowadays they pay money into bank accounts right?
B	yeah
A	if they have more than two payments into one bank account they should like mark up share rights
B	what's going on? Yeah
A	you know I mean nearly people can have half a dozen bank accounts
B	yeah
A	but then there's some sort of I mean there must be some check they can do?
B	well then there must be if if they're if they write out cheques to to this bank account week in week out week in and week out
A	I would have thought so
B	there must be
C	yeah
A	yeah it seems that they're for all this sort of linking up computer programs and doing this and hunting down terrorism things that
B	no
A	you know?
B	no they haven't
A	A trillion hurillion
B	yeah
A	all the money in the world
C	yeah
B	and that's all been wasted
A	yeah
B	because the
A	mm
C	yeah
A	well that's right
B	yeah
A	which were hardly used
B	useless
A	and like they'd sell it to someone and it's totally incompatible with
B	with everything
A	and non-compatible with anything else
B	yeah
C	mm
A	so that
C	mm
A	you know that when it sort of finally bogs down
B	yeah
A	it's just left to write it off
B	that's right
A	and people spent millions
B	they did
A	on computer programs
B	and so did Rainbow well what's his name? Rainbow?
A	that's right
B	oh
A	he he had that bloke write his own program
B	he did didn't he?
A	whereas he could have just gotten the Sage
B	that's right
A	fork out five hundred quid and got a perfect system
B	that's right
A	which would work for anybody
B	cor dear they said  coming
C	yeah
A	he was there every day wasn't he?
B	he's there every day
B	hush hush
A	so that no one else could work out what he's got
B	yeah
A	I wouldn't mind betting out
C	yeah
A	cos he knows what he'd lose
B	I bet it was yeah
A	you know
B	yeah
C	mm
A	he didn't want anyone to know what he's doing with his money did he?
B	no
A	he must be a millionaire by now isn't he?

A	and you know a tea bag lasts lasts a lot longer
B	well they do
A	I'll tell you what I'll soak my up and dry them up and bring them over if you like
B	you won't be the first person to do that you know
A	I usually I also own teabags and then I'll I'll chuck them on the fire

A	mm
B	Don't take long to burn but they give out
A	no
B	some heat
A	mm
B	you know all the cereal packets we never  we never  chuck
A	now this is how I like
B	them in the recycle bin
A	A certain age you are everything used and everything that was combustible used to go in the fire place
B	yeah
A	and we used to love it at Christmas time
B	what with all the crackle bits and what not
A	yeah
B	oh the boxes
A	and you could no chuck your own shoes on the fire

B	oh
A	the fire was a really burn one and
B	yeah

A	watching the pictures in the flames

A	cello tape was around wasn't around wasn't it in the? How the heck did they shut them up?
B	I'm never sure they used just
A	and they didn't have elastic bags either
B	no they didn't did they? They used to just fold them in a certain way
A	but they were sealed though weren't they?
B	they were sealed but I can't remember how they did it
C	wax?
B	mm
C	probably they can
B	couldn't have been wax
C	yeah I think
A	they might have had rudimentary cello tape
B	yeah
A	the one that is is sort of yeah and then
B	I can't remember them putting cello tape
A	I can't remember
B	was there?
A	in the larder you know right at the back

C	you pay for it though?
A	little boy
C	mm

C	Tom and I were looking in the
A	I remember we used to
C	the supermarket the other day
A	we used to
C	flying saucer things

C	oh
A	Cos they were tuppence you see
B	yeah
A	all this sort of cream sugary stuff suddenly became available
B	yeah that was good wasn't it? But we used to
A	mm hm
B	but we used to walk to school
A	same here
B	and so
A	and then there used to be a sweet shop near the school
B	that's right
A	used to buy like penny pennies' worth of hundreds and thousands
B	yeah that's it
A	or Dolly Mixture
C	mm
A	but you could buy sweets for ha'penny couldn't you?
B	you could
A	I mean ha'penny was a valid currency
B	yeah
A	in those days it was worth money
B	that was worth money and and I'll tell you what? It was copper
A	yeah
C	mm
A	and it was completely well not completely but all around the edge it was completely corroded away
B	yeah?
A	Cos they're like just steel aren't they?
B	they're just steel now yeah
C	mm
A	and you think this is a real sign of the times
C	mm

A	I wonder  how many copper coppers that are still around?
B	they're worth more than a penny if they are
A	Cos they changed them over didn't they a while ago?
B	yeah
A	and I expect everyone's been sorting oops
C	right
A	where did that come from? Everyone has been sorting through all their coins you know
B	yup
A	and getting other ones
A	but is it isn't it still against the law to scrap coins?
B	I don't know
A	mm
B	you couldn't deface any coin
A	mm
B	of the realm
C	mm
A	not unless I've gone out of
B	yes
C	you've got a hole in in them
A	yeah
C	used them as bracelets
B	yeah
A	crown grout
B	if they  If they  were before nineteen twenty-one they were sold as silver
A	sold as silver yeah
B	it must be
A	Cos it used to be eight times?
B	yeah
A	and that was some that was before silver went up in price
B	that's right yeah
A	but I doubt very much there's much about these days
B	well we had eight half-crowns didn't we?
C	mm
B	and we got eight pounds for them didn't we?
C	mm
B	this is
A	mm
B	right so we got fiddled yeah
C	yeah
A	you'd have saved them
B	yeah
A	and that's worth a lot more
B	yeah
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	They were worth less than what they got.	Contradiction
B	twenty-five p each
C	when you think about it though that's the sort of thing we should still be doing now whether it's selling stuff from eBay or
B	yeah
C	I mean if you  if you  were desperate for the
B	yeah
A	well this is it this is what we
C	you should do it really
[ANNOTATION]	You can't sell things on eBay.	Contradiction
A	this is what we were saying about with um
B	yeah
A	clearing out Sarah's mum's house right? I mean there's so much stuff there and you can't be bothered you know?
B	no
C	no
A	sort of um
C	mm
A	you know doing it all?
B	yeah
A	and like you've got a house full of stuff and there's a lot of stuff to get rid of on eBay innit
B	yeah it is
A	and uh then we said well you know why don't we just get in touch with uh
[ANNOTATION]	Her mother's house has always been quite empty.	Contradiction
B	house cleaners?
A	yeah or well um not house cleaners exactly but something like the Sally Army or something like that or
C	yeah
A	or Benjamin Foundation
[ANNOTATION]	They should empty the house without external help.	Contradiction
C	yeah
A	they will come and clear it up
B	yeah
A	they'll make some money out of it
C	mm
A	but at least you're doing a good turn
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	They got less than a pound for each.	Entailment
A	you know what I mean? You're getting you know
C	but my my cousin had black this black table out there and a nice really really nice side board didn't he?
B	yeah
C	really nice stuff and he phoned up the Salvation Army and
B	and they didn't want it
A	really?
B	yeah
C	just didn't want to know
[ANNOTATION]	The Salvation Army got their cousin's things.	Contradiction
B	they didn't want it
C	and it's good quality stuff really not
B	yeah
A	where was that?
B	he was
A	yeah where?
B	that was in Norwich
C	yeah
A	oh really?
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	we moved Norwich
B	but there are still
C	the table
A	maybe not the Sally Army but there are
B	yeah
A	places
C	well he couldn't find anyone could he?
B	no he couldn't
A	oh really?
C	that was just the first place he went to
B	no
A	but there is a place which um donate furniture to people who are just moving into
B	isn't that up
A	into flats
C	yeah
A	and they're always looking for furniture
C	Cos I got um when I first moved into the flat in Norwich
B	we did didn't we?
C	really old Belling
B	yeah
C	really old cooker
B	yeah
C	but it it was enough to cook something on
B	yeah
A	but I mean even if
C	uh yeah
A	even if you you know like
C	very cheap
A	giving it away to some young shyster you know
B	yeah
A	whose only making a few quid
C	mm
B	well you see
A	you know think well
C	yeah
A	you know what comes round and goes around doesn't it
B	yeah
A	cos that's how you used to live when you were young
B	yeah
C	that's right
A	you know sort of like on people's charity and whatever they chucked away
B	yeah
C	mm
B	we had to go down the pit
C	mm
A	but what I mean when I we cleared my mum's place out
B	no
A	nothing really I mean most of it was all full of woodworm and that
B	big bonfire
A	big bonfire
C	yeah
A	I mean it was also fairly tidyin and someone mighta needed them
B	yeah
A	and we couldn't be bothered and we just put them out and the council towed them away in the end
B	yeah
A	when the council and you think yeah these are the I wonder what council will do with them you know
B	yeah
A	maybe recycle them or something
B	maybe
A	no
C	mm
A	they brought a big bin wagon in chucked them in the back
C	yeah
A	and then took them and maybe it might be different nowadays with the um
B	but this is the problem with
C	all the time you just got to find the right you know the right person to
B	yeah
C	pass it on to haven't you?
B	well we we had all the Help the Aged come and take all my mum's
A	mm
B	they came and took all the fur coats loads of fur coats she had
A	but this is another thing about
C	mm
A	clothes recycling and stuff
B	yeah
A	they were saying you know what happens throughout the world with this sort of recycling stuff
B	yeah
C	mm
B	yeah
A	but no they take all this stuff and if it's no good that yeah goes into another pile
B	yeah
A	you know it's all sorted about half a dozen times
C	right
A	and and the last pile they have it goes through these machines with sort of little needles on which plucks all those threads out
C	yeah
A	all this threaded stuff
B	yeah
A	and that goes in as a clay pot filling and god knows
B	oh right
A	what and
B	yeah
C	mm
A	every little bit is used
B	well that's brilliant that isn't it?
C	mm
A	even if yeah and a lot of it get shipped over
C	mm
A	to third world countries
C	mm
A	but when it goes over there
B	shreds?
A	slices no not shred
B	slice
A	sort of slices them into big bits
B	yeah
A	Cos then they get them and they sort of cut out the bits of material which are useful
C	mm
A	and use that to make other things
B	other things
A	you know what I mean like they get a shirt
B	yeah
C	mm
A	and they cut the
C	yeah
A	take the back of the shirt out
B	yeah
A	and turn it into a kid's shirt or something like that
C	mm
B	brilliant
A	and all the bits what are left
C	yeah
A	you know then goes to these machines which shred it up and turn it into
B	yeah
C	mm
A	for stuffing into toys or whatever or making mats or
B	yeah
C	mm
B	yeah
A	you know and and actually and there was yeah one before the actual final end these threads which they this machine sort of pulls all the threads out and they're woven into carpets
B	oh?
C	right
A	you know they they get these threads and these like bits of wool
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	and then they they spin them
B	yeah
C	mm
B	wow
A	that's just incredible
B	that is  That is  good isn't it?
C	so many things
A	so I never
C	mm
B	yeah
A	it all finds a use
C	right
A	and you think that's brilliant innit
C	yeah
B	we we got bags come around please put all your old
A	mm
B	clothes in the bag
C	mm
B	put them outside and they were out there for weeks
A	mm
C	yeah
B	and that's where they finished
C	mm
A	but in the car parks in
C	yes
A	there's these uh
C	you got them now
A	salvation Army recycling clothes things?
C	mm hm
A	what you can
C	and you can put toys you can put them in there
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	mm
A	and I read a couple of weeks ago that the Salvation Army has actually bought this company out
A	so they  so they  get all the money out of it and they're not paying
B	oh
A	yeah
C	mm
A	but there's a lot that's why a lot of these bins you get uh these bags you get where it says you know help you know help the poor
C	yeah
A	children
B	yeah
A	or help the poor this and help the poor that
C	mm
A	and you know the you know cancers and god knows what
B	yeah
A	whales
C	mm
B	yeah
A	they're just getting it's
C	yeah It is
A	but even so at the end of the day they're recycling the stuff
B	well they are
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	you know
C	mm
A	sort of mobsters
B	yeah
A	going round and making a fortune out of this sort of stuff packed
B	yeah
A	you know Latvia and places like this
C	mm
B	yeah
C	well the underlay that goes under this floor like the soft stuff
B	oh yeah that was
C	that's all chewed up fibres and put together like a big mat
B	yeah
B	brilliant stuff
C	mm
B	yeah
A	is all recycled stuff
C	yeah I suppose it is
A	when you look at it they're sort of like
C	it's got to be really hasn't it?
A	grey
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	when you look at it and you shred it all up there's all sorts of stuff i'n't there?
B	yeah
C	yeah
C	then they do that wood don't they? That style what is it? Style?
B	yeah that's the one we saw
C	I think it's called
B	the one we saw
C	yeah it's all
A	is it?
C	bits of yeah
B	yeah
C	Wood dust and
B	Wood dust and fibres
A	that's
C	yeah
B	you know and yeah sort of planings
A	mm
C	yeah Planing bits and
B	all the planings
C	mm
B	and everything
C	compressed with glue
B	and it just
B	we watched them make that on on the
A	mm
B	on the  box
C	mm
B	and uh
C	mm
A	wellI don't know
C	no
A	I think they used
C	no
B	yeah
A	mm
C	mm
B	but they will not warp or twist
A	no
B	and that you you can't get through them
A	mm
B	they're really hard
B	that is twenty years ago
A	it's kinda interesting innit? Like you say you get this factory with this huge machine in it chucking out this stuff
B	yeah
A	and if you had to start from scratch
B	God
A	you wouldn't be able to have made it would ya?
B	no
A	Cos they would be so expensive
B	no it would
A	but once you got the machinery
B	that's it
A	away you go
B	yeah
A	it's only cos they got the machinery there
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	that's right
B	and they had to ship them over to Switzerland or Sweden
A	Germany I think it was
B	was it Germany?
A	yeah
B	they had to ship them over there
A	you'd think it'd been quicker to ship a plant over here wouldn't you?
B	you would wouldn't you?
A	I don't suppose it's very
C	yeah
B	I don't suppose there could be much in it could they?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	room and a compressor
B	that's right
C	mm
A	you know you just
C	mm
B	you just suck it all out and keep it
C	mm
B	put it in a tank and then let it out
A	I don't know
B	has she?
A	yeah
B	what has she done with her old one? Give it to you?
A	no
B	oh I see
A	and didn't send and all this sort of stuff
B	right
A	and that was old one anyway
B	oh was it? Oh that's okay yeah
C	oh yeah we recycle phones
B	yeah
A	so um she went down and bought a uh Samsung Galaxy
B	oh what? Oh wow
C	how did she manage it?
A	it's the phone of the moment
B	it's the phone of the moment that's even better than a the the Mac phone
A	the iPhone
B	the iPhone
A	but the one she got is like model one as opposed to model five
B	oh right
A	which is the latest one
B	yeah
A	but she does enjoy
A	and then oh oh
B	yeah
A	and what happens is is that when you top up like you can get a ten pound top up which is just as you go
B	yeah
A	with
B	pay as you go
A	you know half a dozen you know well so many free minutes and
B	yeah
A	texts and stuff but otherwise or fifteen quid top up
B	yeah
A	or you can have a month's
B	free texts
A	free phone free texts free use of the internet
B	oh right
A	for a month
B	yeah?
A	and then you can  and then you can  go and get another fifteen quid's worth and then you can
B	yeah
A	right? And that's what she wanted it for
B	oh right
C	yeah
A	she's got her own Sat Nav on her phone because you can use it when you're walking around as well
B	but doesn't that use a lot of battery?
A	doesn't seem to
B	Don't it? Cos they reckon that walkers
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	but it's got all it's got like everything on it you know it's quite amazing like the internet oh oh oh
A	wow
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	and yet you you know obviously cos it's got GPS on it
B	yeah
A	so you can always push a button and it tells you where you are on it
C	mm
A	that's why she's always sort of frightened of getting lost you know when she goes off places and
B	yeah
A	and she has to
B	oh yeah
A	but she says oh when you're on your own and you're driving you don't know where you're going
C	yeah
A	or what you're doing and stuff like that
B	yeah that's right
C	yeah
A	and you can just like
C	yeah
A	click the thing and
B	yeah
A	and it tells you where to go
B	yeah
C	mm
B	that is a good idea
A	no tell me where you are as if well look you realise you don't want to know where you are
B	where you're going
A	you don't care where you are
C	mm
A	but anyway but no but you know from couple of weeks it's like giving a fifteen year old
C	right
C	that's what I'm afraid of
A	how do you do this? I don't know I haven't got a mobile phone
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	it doesn't it's not doing this
B	yeah
C	mm
B	right
A	they don't tell you in the book
B	oh
B	this is the problem I had with I mean we were talking about getting a phone each
C	yeah
B	and but I don't know
C	people who walk around with a phone everywhere you know
A	and
C	really?
B	was it?
A	yeah in the mobile phone shop in
B	mm
C	wow
A	and like it does everything you ever want it to do
B	yeah
C	mm
A	and like they say you can either have it pay as you go or get a month's contract for fifteen quid
B	wow
A	which is just incredible isn't it?
B	yeah
A	and uh oh there is hang on it's uh yes it's less than I pay for my computer
B	yeah
A	and a free phone and stuff
C	yeah
A	and uh when she went she said spent it all
B	yeah
A	no that's alright you know let me have a look
C	mm
A	so he opened the back up sort of wriggled it
A	so now
B	oh yeah
A	works phone
C	mm
A	she's got her old one and the new one
C	oh right
C	and you haven't got one?
A	I don't have one
C	mm
B	no I don't blame you
A	I don't even know
C	yeah
B	no
C	I don't we don't know ours still
B	no we don't know our mobile number
A	mm
B	the only thing we found it very useful for was when we were on holiday this year
C	mm
B	uh of course
A	oh right
C	mm
A	why she got medicated?
B	no she well she's out now
A	oh
C	mm
B	but uh we promised we'd go down and see her sometime this week
C	yeah
A	probably another day?
B	yeah we don't know
C	mm
A	probably yeah
B	yeah
A	to take with her cos if she broke down cos she was doing a lot of driving to Norwich and back and she needed it if she broke down to call up the the uh recovery people
C	that's why I got one
A	see that's whereas see I don't really worry about things like that
C	mm
A	I mean we are in broad daylight so I'll just start start walking
B	yeah
C	mm
B	I've done that many times
A	yeah
B	well that's right I mean nowadays with with the mobile technology they got now
A	mm
B	when you phone up the RSA
A	that's right this is the GPS stuff isn't it?
B	yeah
C	mm
B	they can pin point where you are and if you're a woman by yourself they'd say we'll be there within the quarter of an hour
A	yeah
B	oh right
A	yeah
B	North Tuddenham? Oh right
A	yeah so they in park I mean
B	I is it? No
A	that's right
B	yeah
A	oh no you can get a free phone at your phone company blah blah blah
B	yeah
A	and
C	mm
A	it turns out
B	North Tuddenham
A	I had him in North Tottenham
B	did it? Oh really
A	I said to him  I said to him that would be a really good phone if you're going to go out and murder someone
B	wow
A	instead of me pin pointing your phone it you'd have a lasting alibi wouldn't you?
C	yeah
A	you're miles away
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	but why on earth would that pick him up at North Tuddenham?
B	I don't know
C	mm
B	I have no dear
C	mm
B	Cos when when
C	mm
A	but it's the same when we went out to
B	yeah
A	it was spot on all the way
B	yeah
A	incredible
B	that is incredible
A	and I
C	yeah
A	and then cos then she said um this thing when when on Easter day her sister was around there and like they've got four Sat Nav's right?
B	yeah
A	Cos they've always got to have the best so they keep getting newer and newer ones
C	mm
A	and for their camping van they need a really big one
B	oh right
A	so they can you know and Sarah said oh you you know are you chucking out are you giving any of them away? And
C	mm hm
C	oh
B	yeah
A	this sort of
C	mm
A	you know like some people are really worried about
B	yeah
A	some things and other people
C	yeah
A	this sort of paranoia about finding places
C	mm
A	and you know forever you know driving round and round the M Twenty-five for the next five years
C	yeah
A	you know
B	well even with the Sat Nav
A	mm
B	we've actually put where we want go in the Set Nav and it was only last year when we were coming home and it says turn right
C	yeah we've
A	you're driving round
C	did
A	in circles
B	there's the road
C	we did it again and again didn't we?
B	again
A	uh huh
C	so now we go a bit further this time and it still turns left
B	and it still took us round we went up there and then it told
C	once you get
B	you turn there and then it told you turn there then went back in that bit again
C	yeah but every time we went on the you know
A	why you're trying to get on the main road?
B	we're trying to get on the main road
A	yeah
C	mm
A	Cos that's the trouble there cos when you look at the map you're never quite sure whether it goes under or joins
B	that's right
A	ain't it?
B	yeah
C	whether it's one way system
A	yeah
C	or
B	yeah
C	mm
A	well I I looked I thought well
B	yeah
A	and then I sort of looked on the net and there's all that you know sort of out like how they graded them and you know
B	galvin and TomTom and
A	Good goods and bads of them and uh we saw that number four Google Navigation oh this will soon and take over from all Set Nav's you know
B	yeah
A	it's really good blah blah blah you know it's excellent
B	yeah
A	the only thing left to watch out is don't use it in Europe otherwise you get roaming charges
B	oh right
A	you know what I mean?
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	and it said that yeah you don't need anything else
A	but there was one I saw an advertised one with the cos most of them are the cheap ones you got something like three and a half inch screens and stuff?
B	yeah that's right
A	and I saw this one and it was four and a half inch screen and it was a television as well
B	what?
C	wow
A	and it was only about thirty-nine quid or something
B	oh god
A	forty quid
C	we're getting that
A	I know they always were worth it you know what I mean? No
A	mm
B	I don't know
A	four G
B	four G is it?
A	that's the latest
B	is it? It's got all that business in it
A	yeah
B	and uh he's got the Sat Nav will be on and then that will tell you someone is trying to phone you
A	mm hm
B	and uh you answer the phone through the Sat Nav and you just carry on talking through the Sat Nav
A	that's that's what I've
B	yeah
A	she wants a hands free
B	hands free
A	bluetooth thing where you can
B	bluetooth that's the thing
A	that's right and apparently you can talk to your telephone
B	yeah
A	through it and it and you know and also she didn't know but she thought you could actually turn your your Google Maps thing on
B	yeah
A	yeah know and then it gives you all the directions straight into your earpiece
B	yeah
A	turn left
B	yeah
A	turn right
C	no that way
A	yeah
B	that's what it should be
A	U turn
B	yeah
A	when the road is clear
B	yeah
B	no I'm now going down the A One
A	I can't see why you need to do that
B	they do don't it?
A	yeah
B	I mean
A	mm
B	according to the Set Nav
A	mm
B	right the road is over here and we're bumping along through this field
A	that's cos you never  you never  pay to have it upgraded
B	that is true
A	you know if you thought to have how much is it? Thirty quid or something?
B	yeah
A	you got the
B	and then we we go towards Birmingham you see and it says uh at the next roundabout turn right no roundabout
A	mm
B	all it's got is a flyover
A	yeah
B	and then turn right and go over the fly over
A	but you still need your wits about you
B	you still need your wits about you
A	but I reckon um you know most of the time you don't really need them cos like going cross country
B	well that's
A	you just follow your nose don't you really?
B	yeah
A	is when you're getting
B	is when you get in a big place
A	yeah when you get to the town
B	yeah
A	and you're trying to find
B	yeah
A	the address
B	yeah
A	you know or you're trying to get there
B	I going to um
A	mm
B	right? One is up tho King's Lynn
A	across the
B	and across that way
A	yeah
B	one is
A	Cambridge
B	down and through Cambridge
A	mm hm
B	and the next one and that will take you down the M twenty-five down in London
A	mm hm
B	and then round that way
A	but you see
B	the best way we found is
A	for a lot of
B	the Cambridge one
A	for a lot of people they'd much rather drive on the M eleven the M twenty-five
B	yeah
A	yeah like that stay on the motorway
B	and if you look on the Google Map thing uh one is ten minutes longer journey another one is fifty minutes longer journey but shorter you know
A	but that road which goes through um Royston and Baldock
B	oh is it eight five O five aren't they?
A	yes
B	yeah
A	oh that's a lovely road
B	that is it's a beautiful road
A	and they've built it all out and
B	yeah
A	you know and wiped out
B	A scenic road and you
A	that's right
B	that is a good road
A	and it's yeah
B	no
A	when we were going cross country I always I like that road
B	I like that road
A	cos it's it's um it's all nice
B	that is a nice road and when they dug it and out threw in all that chalk
A	that's right
B	yeah
A	put a bit of a tunnel in it on there stuff
B	put the tunnel in and um yeah
A	once that first Chipping Norton is it?
B	Chipping Norton yeah
A	which is the only hold up there you go
B	yeah
A	but then that's sort of like
B	but you used to have to go through Baldock won't you? To get to the A one that must be right?
A	that's right
B	but now you don't and you just go down there and you start with the A one
A	that's right
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah it's quite easy
A	and even like if you go through the Luton to the M One
B	yeah
A	that's an easy route
B	that's another easy route
A	you know perhaps half a dozen traffic lights that's all that is
B	yeah
A	you know there's all all the road has been built out
B	but we went on the A fourteen and that is a really really
A	mm
B	nice road
A	what's that one through Bedford?
B	ah
A	Cambridge Bedford?
A	yeah
B	and that way yeah
C	yeah
B	the A fourteen
C	it was very easy and
B	and so easy
C	I know I didn't drive but
A	mm
B	it was so easy
C	it was a lovely journey
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	Don't you?
B	yeah
A	you when you sort of like know where you are when looking at the map and
B	that's right
A	give you something to do when you're sitting in the car
C	yeah you still need the map
A	when I read the map
C	but I lost track of where how far down the
A	oh
C	A whatever it was we were
A	oh right
C	and I'm thinking that's Exeter and I thought why don't you just go across
B	yes that's right
C	the middle?
B	where you're going
C	mm
A	at any one time you know and
C	well I just
A	and uh
C	I expect we're turning off in a minute didn't I?
B	yeah
C	we should be turning off in a minute and we couldn't seem to be
A	but
C	oh no
B	oh there was one roundabout we yes
A	and then she wonders why I get exasperated
C	I remember before we had the Sat Nav
B	no
C	mm
B	I can't remember ever going mad
A	you see if I'm ever going on a journey which I don't know where I'm going or I got to turn off somewhere I'll have the journey in the head and I could remember most of it
B	yeah
C	mm
A	and then as you got to turn off on some sort of like weird slip road or something like that I'll get up Google Maps and look at it
B	yeah
A	so I can remember
C	mm
A	and then follow it down and or this you know
B	yeah
A	you like more or less know what I'm gonna do
B	can you?
A	yeah
C	but in the past if you took the wrong turning then when you go down there again you think oh yes we went down here
A	mm
B	yeah
C	and you go wrong again
B	where'd we go where we were going along the road Sat Nav was telling us where to go down here turn right on the next road turn right turn right and it's down a farm track
C	yeah
B	no if you got a Sat Nav you're they've sent you the wrong way turn round and go back that's what it said
C	mm
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	mm
A	mm
C	yeah
A	mm
C	yeah
B	there's been some dodgy stuff in here
A	well they always I mean I'm sure they always could if you program in words
B	sure you could
A	proper roads and stuff
B	yeah
A	but like you know I mean
C	I haven't been out I suppose
A	mm
C	direct routes
A	mm
B	yeah when we went to Plymouth
C	when we went to plan with someone
B	we had to
C	yeah
B	and Plymouth is a
C	A nightmare
B	you know is a nightmare to drive in Plymouth
A	mm
C	mm once you're there and then
A	but it's got the whole sort of town centre off one side doesn't it?
B	yeah
C	mm
A	so it tends to shunt you all the way round
B	yeah
A	not straight through the the sort of major route go right through it isn't there?
B	that's right
C	yeah
A	you can't leave it at all
B	but this time sometimes they build stupid though don't they?
C	mm
B	and then she said we're driving along the right road and all of a sudden it says at the next turn turn around and when when you can turn around you have to gone the wrong way or something and it done it all the time and you you said stupid woman
C	yeah
B	on a major road
C	you did
A	there's nothing else there
B	and this is
A	and that could be most disconcerting if you're
C	yeah it could
A	on your own and
C	well on a main road it said
A	Cos you're not quite sure where you are
B	yeah
C	make a U turn as soon as possible
B	yeah
C	no way are you gonna make a U turn on this
B	I thought we were on  we were on  that big
C	horrendous route
B	U turn whenever you can
A	mm
B	and there's no
C	make a U turn
B	no U turns allowed at all
C	it said make a U turn
B	oh there was one gap
C	but you're not going to do it
B	no there's a gap in in the crash barriers
C	mm
B	where they hadn't fitted where I was
A	but you aren't actually allowed to go through it are you?
B	no
A	mm
B	but it says make a U turn
C	yeah
A	well you have to drive all the way to the next slip road
B	you do
C	mm
B	yeah or the next roundabout or whatever
C	mm hm
B	but that didn't bother us did it?
unknown_female	no
C	yeah
B	yes
C	it's really good
B	that's really good
C	yeah
B	there's only people like minded there
C	this track down to the hostel
B	oh my goodness
C	we didn't dare come out again in case the car broke
B	in case the car broke down
C	it was a long track and like
B	it was about two miles long the track was wasn't it?
A	to the hostel?
B	with rocks
C	potholes everywhere
B	with rocks and pot you know? I mean heavy rocks
C	mm hm
B	with shiny tops
C	mm
A	shiny tops?
B	yes
A	the
B	yeah
C	it's much hairy
B	well very careful
C	mm
B	you don't miss all
A	how come they don't fix it?
B	I don't know
C	yeah they said two years now
B	this is where we went to Tin Tad's last year
C	this is why we didn't go last year
B	yeah
C	Cos we wanted to go last year and they they were saying they're promising that they're gonna do the road up
B	they're gonna do the road up this year
C	so we thought well we'll wait until the road's done up and then we'll go
B	so we thought that it had been done up this year
C	but it hasn't
B	no
C	and people put in the guest book even the drive down to the hostel is an adventure in itself
B	yes
A	gosh you'd think there'd be some idiot sued them for
B	you would wouldn't yeah?
A	for a loss of the
B	yeah
A	Seven hundred quid
B	half shaft gone for it
A	mm
C	most people don't seem to mind at all do they?
B	something smashed
A	mm
C	but we got worried that we won't travel out
A	wouldn't risk you're your elderly car
B	well it was getting back
A	yeah
B	that's the whole point
C	we have to be there
A	mm
B	we had to be there by five o'clock at night
C	no excuses is there?
B	at the latest
A	how many days did you spend in the hostel?
C	Seven
B	we were seven days in the
C	very easy then
A	so was it near the beach?
C	that we
B	dead on top of the cliff
A	oh right
B	there's the There's the
A	you said it's just a stone's throw from the beach
B	oh yeah
A	trouble is that was two hundred yards down
B	right on top of the cliff
C	yeah
B	but we could there is no beaches
A	no
B	the only beaches there were was when the tide was out
A	well this is the thing
C	always high tide
A	when when um we went camping down there and uh you know we were sort of going in different places and walk around stuff like that and that the only beaches you'd find when they'd be a little clove and like yeah you walk like quarter a mile down to it
B	yeah
A	and there would be a little patch of sand and rocks
B	that's it
A	and stuff
B	yeah
C	mm
A	and about two hundred people down there
B	yeah
A	and
C	oh no
A	you know people were actually laying on each other's towels
B	oh
C	oh
A	yeah overlapping and then I said you know well I guess
C	oh
B	no
C	uh uh
A	no I can't hack that
B	that was like the last place we went
C	yeah
A	oh yeah it's like a load of um seals laying there
B	yeah
A	you know and everyone's sort of out moving about and jumping up and kicking sand and kids and stuff like that
B	yeah
A	well it was a glorious day you know what I mean?
C	yeah
A	sorry but I sort of think you know
C	it's not for us at all
A	I go on a beach
C	is it?
B	mm
A	I don't like to see anyone on it
B	no
A	thus maybe a little dot in the distance you know?
B	that's right
A	mm
B	that was fantastic
C	mm
B	further up the road
C	yeah
B	and sort of
C	famous type of beach really good you've got to go
B	A famous beach
C	beautiful sand
B	they were saying fantastic
A	mm
C	mm
B	we got down to this beach where we could see there was people down there but when we got down to the beach you literally had to step over their feet
A	mm hm
B	and they were they had everything on the beach didn't they?
C	mm
B	everything and you'd think why?
A	mm
B	why why have you done all that for?
A	yeah
C	what's the fun?
A	what I remember is
C	I can't see  I can't see  the fun in it
A	they're gonna spend all day there aren't they?
C	mm
A	when they need something to do
C	yeah
B	and they got the lot and they were nowhere to play
A	in our day we just had a bag with your boiled eggs and your
B	yeah
A	well it's a consumer society isn't it? You know people have all this stuff
C	mm
A	and it's sort of tempting to take it I suppose
B	well we took once we took our cos we got a camping gas thing
C	it was in a car park
A	was that in Swan?
C	in scoff them at the Swan
B	well we had a cup of and we never took it again that's when you've wasted time stupid thing
C	yeah
B	wasted time
C	is it
B	yeah
A	well exactly
B	mm
A	yeah I mean
C	mm
A	but yeah like it's it's true I mean but I don't even go to
B	yeah
A	I mean it's quite a few places you can park in there
C	that's right
A	and go for a walk and that and they've got a bit of grass near it
B	yeah
A	and picnic gardens
B	yeah
A	and people will do the same there
B	yeah
A	they unload the car you know got all the camping barbecue stuff out
B	mm
A	tables games
C	yeah
A	of tennis nets and bags and cricket and frisbees and footballs and
B	they must be people that
A	then they go out and
B	with no garden or flats
A	well I don't know how come they got all this gear if they ain't got a garden to keep it in
B	that's true yeah
A	perhaps they need a shed
B	yeah
C	mm
A	it's just you know
B	I don't understand it either
C	that's why we like with these remote places don't we?
B	yeah
C	there is no one there
B	there's nobody there
A	that's right nothing to do except walk and walk and look
C	there's nothing to do
B	and literally look and look at the
A	yeah
B	rock formations and the caves and all that sort of stuff
C	mm
B	we love all that don't we?
C	mm
B	but people
A	I know yeah
B	they are yeah
C	well how many  how many  people did we meet really on or walk? Not a lot really did we?
B	we didn't see hardly anyone
C	considering it was beginning of Easter holidays
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	and those you do see always say hello and
C	yeah
A	mm
B	and you talk to them
B	you only talk as you're passing
A	mm
B	but that's it
A	I almost spent Easter in
C	did she?
A	yeah
C	alright
A	lostwithiel I think it's called isn't it?
B	yeah
A	this place
B	that's right
A	in a  In a  log cabin
B	well we had one day's rain
A	mm
B	we we took our gear on
A	yeah
B	this huge storm blew up and it came off the sea like a little what is it it blew blowing us off the cliff
A	you'd had to hunker down under a rock
C	it was horrible
B	yeah
A	tie yourself down to the
B	hail stones where coming down at you horizontal at that course
A	yeah
B	and hitting you and stinging and god they sting
C	they really stung you didn't they? We forgot coats and
A	well I expect you took the brunt of it protecting
B	no I did
C	no he was marching ahead
B	but that that was quite awful and we did I mean that did soak us
C	mm
B	eventually got us through all the
A	mm
B	and that was only for what? Twenty minutes? But twenty minutes in a huge storm was
A	yeah
B	oh really?
A	with our camping van right?
B	yeah
A	rent a  Rent a  camping van for a week and uh they said you know hopefully it won't rain
A	oh you're going to the Lake District you know yeah
B	the rain is plenty
A	the hint  The hint The hint  is in the name
B	yes
A	yes I think three hundred days of the year ain't it?
B	yeah
A	it rains out out of three sixty?
B	yeah
A	and then other sixty days are just drizzle
B	we went cos we'd been to the Lake District a couple of times and and uh we thought well we'll go out today see this hostel that we stayed in before
A	yeah
B	over us like a river
A	I mean the thing is if you go I mean if you're staying in a hostel or a bed and breakfast at least they got drying rooms and stuff
B	that's right
A	when you're living in a blooming camper van
B	oh they got nothing and then
A	you're going to stay damp
B	oh with a dog
A	all of sudden
C	oh
A	this this has gone in a camping van you know when I said they've got this huge sort of camping modern camping van fitted with a shower and double bed and all this sort of stuff
B	yeah
A	they go to the Lake District where they hope they'll be no rain
C	yeah
B	I was telling him about that day we went round to look at this youth hostel that we'd stayed in before
C	couldn't get out the car
A	I think we got damage in that
C	it got?
B	yeah there was a little bit there
A	I thought had a bit of wood fairing there and polish it up
B	no no no
A	is that why you got it cheap?
C	well which one
B	it was definitely wood
C	the one you got some money off
B	it was definitely wood
C	yeah
B	it didn't have a lot
A	I only noticed cos
C	it didn't risk
A	they come on the side
B	we didn't  We didn't  even look on the side of them
A	yeah
A	and you just thought it's alright telling everyone else how to do it but
B	yeah
A	when it comes to doing it yourself you know?
B	yeah
C	mm
A	Cos now I mean fine you finally got around to buying a new television as well
B	have you? Oh wow
C	mm
B	and still
A	didn't want to spend much
B	was it
A	that's right
B	yeah
A	we didn't want to spend much
B	yeah
A	and they sent us a twenty-six inch one by mistake
B	did they?
A	so you don't know whether that's a good or a bad thing but set it all up the picture is crap
B	is it?
A	yeah
B	yeah? Oh wow why is that?
A	no
C	yeah
A	it might be
B	mm
C	yeah
A	like an old cowboy film or something
B	yeah
A	and then you go then if you click on another station or ITV it's all sort of that washed out colour
C	mm
A	you know
B	yeah
A	it's very very iffy
C	I remember our pixated a lot didn't it?
A	God
C	especially BBC
A	yeah
C	for us
B	do you know what you can
A	yeah you can you know you can set the picture on uh a cool wall
B	yeah
A	or usually you can set up a user
B	that's right
A	or dynamic I think there's all these different things
A	which give you a slightly different
B	wow
C	mm
A	but you don't want that do you?
B	you don't want that
A	and
B	what is it Panasonic is it?
A	no it's a Haier or something like that
B	oh right
A	some German make
B	well what we had to get or we I've got put up
C	mm
B	here is a what was it called?
C	booster thing?
B	A booster
C	an aerial booster
A	when I think when I
C	it's been a bit better since wasn't it?
B	yeah it's been alright mostly
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	we have got a booster up there
C	yeah
B	but I had six televisions working off one booster while they didn't work with one cos we didn't have six televisions
A	mm
B	but when we build the house I wired it all up
A	yeah
B	so that there was a television in every room
A	mm hm
B	so we had to have a six room
A	yeah
B	booster
C	mm
B	you remember that one?
A	upstairs right
B	yeah
A	mm
B	there was no television on
A	mm
A	well I yeah
B	yeah
A	and uh when I did look at the changeover because before they changed over
B	yeah
A	our old telly's work on digital box
B	yeah
A	we used to get a brilliant picture
B	yeah
C	mm
A	all the stuff and like all the programs which everyone else would get we used to get
B	yeah
C	oh
A	as soon as they changed over all the pictures went fuzzy
B	yeah
A	the background was sort of swimming
B	oh yeah
A	you know cos then
C	yeah
A	we had to get rid of the old digital box
B	yeah
A	and buy the little you know Freeview box
B	yeah
A	then but it still wasn't very good
B	it's the aerial
A	it's not very good
B	yeah
A	A digital aerial
B	A digital aerial
A	and also what they said is the cable
B	the correct cables
A	you got you can buy special cables they have
B	that's right
A	digital transmission which is better
B	which is there's no loss on them
C	mm
A	that's right and so
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about digital transmission	Entailment
B	yeah
A	that will be the next thing
B	yeah
A	to go and get a new aerial
B	no
A	you know like twenty quid or something
[ANNOTATION]	person A do not know how many quid	Neutral
B	that's right
A	you can get an aerial
B	you've got to have it put up then haven't you?
A	well I can get on the roof
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about building	Contradiction
B	you can get up there can you?
A	but you see it's a flat roof over the shop
B	oh right
A	and then I can get up onto the roof from there
B	yeah
A	and its only sort of a little step on a roof ladder you know it's all quite safe you know you're not hanging over the edge or anything
B	no
C	mm
A	I've been up there before
B	yeah when you're up giving a show
B	no I'm not going up there
A	standing there with a mobile phone with ready to dial for the ambulance
A	no I but I mean probably worse comes to worse I can just stick on the end of the go on the flat roof and just stick it on the end of the eves
B	yeah
A	stick
B	mm
A	mm no
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about book	Contradiction
B	building opposite you
A	no
[ANNOTATION]	they don't know the building opposite or not	Entailment
B	there's a tree?
A	A big tree opposite and
B	yeah
A	a big Beech tree
B	yeah
A	but as I say we a got pretty you know normal problem
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	is it problem normal or not	Neutral
A	and uh but I'm not home
B	no
A	but there's a there's definitely
B	there's still some nuisance ain't it?
A	yeah but it's definitely something with the transmissions and stuff as well
B	yeah
A	because you can get I sit there you know and you can do contrast and brightness
B	yeah
A	and then manipulate like different colours
B	yeah
A	and you know all this sort of sharpness
B	plenty of options
A	plenty of options of what you're playing with you know
B	yeah
A	and you can get like the skin tone really good
B	oh mine will show not
A	but no on this
B	oh right
A	but then all these like the weather people they always seem to wear these sort of very bright coloured clothes
B	which
A	and like you know red something comes up all red and like
B	yeah
A	you know although you've turned the red right down the blue really you know
C	oh
A	it's really blue
C	mm
A	but I have noticed that with other people's televisions as well
B	yeah
A	so maybe it's cos you're not used to it
B	well maybe it's
C	it's too bright
B	we we got used to it
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	well this is the same problem
C	yeah
A	and also because it's because we used to have a square telly right? It was just right for us
