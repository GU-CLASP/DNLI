B	preheat the oven to
A	right so can you do that
B	erm yes
C	all the ingredients
B	we do
A	I don't think you've all got them all out though
B	no
A	what other things do you need?
B	erm
A	right
B	self-raising flour
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	the cake contains flour	Entailment

A	okay
B	and then we also or we also need a roasting tin measuring twenty times
A	yes yes yes
B	yeah
A	it's
B	okay
A	what do
B	er I mean I've looked and well beat the butter sugar flour baking powder and eggs together using
A	I bet it says a wooden spoon
B	oh an electric whisk ooh
C	oh I want I've always wanted
A	so what's the
C	to use one of these
A	but the first
B	me too
A	but you have done it many times
[ANNOTATION]	someone has little experience	Contradiction
C	yes but I want
[ANNOTATION]	someone wants to be careful	Entailment
A	what's the first stage that you think you need to do though?
B	measure them all out
A	measure them all out and then put them in the big bowl
B	okay so we need two hundred and twenty-five grams of butter
A	okay
C	two hundred and seventy-five including the other bits of butter
A	yes we don't need two hundred and seventy-five
C	oh
[ANNOTATION]	they need oil	Neutral
B	yeah
A	we need two hundred and twenty-five because we're just making the
B	is that we had to add them up for the list
A	yeah
B	cos if we didn't add them up we would just get two hundred and twenty-five and then something else
C	oh
A	yes
B	and I'll I'll do the mix I'll do some stirring and then
A	how hard is this butter though? that's quite hard I'm gonna microwave it for a bit add something else into it
C	erm
A	what's next?
B	we need
A	no no no don't egg add the eggs first cos that's all wet you want all the
A	dry ingredients
B	caster sugar
A	right caster sugar
C	caster sugar
B	er
A	it needs to go into here first
B	also it needs to be twenty
A	read it properly
B	two hundred and twenty-five grams of butter
A	two hundred and twenty-five grams
B	you do a bit erm so where shall we measure up to?
B	so for two hundred and twenty
A	can you tell me when the line looks to you like it's on the zero? okay say when
B	when
A	in that position?
B	yeah
A	yeah but you shouldn't be craning your neck over does it look like it's on zero now?
B	it looks like it's on zero now
A	so tell
B	well I can't see when it says two hundred and twenty-five oh two hundred here?
A	no here there's two hundred you banana
B	okay
A	alright? so
C	tally-ho
A	tell him when he's nearing to it
B	you're getting nearer
A	don't lean on the bowl
B	keep going
A	don't lean on the bowl cos you're gonna weight it down with your hands keep going
B	bit more
C	now?
A	no no bit more
C	yeah
B	I'll pour it in
A	you tip it in
B	erm
A	self-raising flour?
B	two hundred and twenty-five self-raising flour
A	okay
B	sifted
A	well do the sifting after we've measured it
B	okay
A	okay?
B	do I have to sift it into the bowl?
C	so
A	yeah
C	two hundred and twenty-five tell me when it gets to eight
B	okay
A	that's it keep going
B	mm now
C	what?
B	it's not
A	it's nearly on eight
B	there it's eight I'll do some of the sifting
A	yeah some of the sifting but then
B	okay
C	okay
B	cos you're better I'll just pour some of it in
A	okay do we need to have greased the tray? yes greased and lined with baking parchment so you'll be doing that in a minute as well
C	hey
A	okay?
C	ah there
A	right give that a good old sift no no no not against the bowl against your hand
B	I always think it looks like snow
A	it does look like snow
B	falling onto a mountain
A	yes
B	erm
A	sift it
B	erm
A	yeah
B	erm
A	okay nicely done
C	oh it smells really good
A	okay keep it in the bowl
B	yeah
A	that's it very nice it was the same amount wasn't it for the butter
A	ah I don't know why I put extra in I needed to put
C	course it's like too late
A	yeah but we want two hundred and twenty-five don't we?
C	yeah that is two hundred and twenty-five
B	okay there I always think it looks so funny whenever it comes up
C	yeah
A	what into the air?
B	yeah
A	what else do you need?
B	erm we need erm how many
A	what?
B	we erm two level tablespoons of baking powder
A	well hang on a minute what do you mix with what? what does it say on the first instruction?
B	well it was going to be butter
C	and self-raising
A	well there's the butter
C	there's the butter
A	so you can't necessarily add the baking powder yet but does it tell you to do that?
C	we've already done the baking powder
A	it says in no you haven't done the baking powder you've done the self-raising flour in a large mole beat the butter sugar flour baking powder and eggs together so you need the baking powder and the eggs before you do
B	okay erm
A	the mixing
B	we need to find the baking powder
A	right but what
C	there's baking powder
A	how much do you need though?
B	let me see
A	two level teaspoons
A	good grief
B	shall we try and spoon it all on the butter so it looks like Mount Everest?
A	well it doesn't matter
B	perhaps
A	cos it's going to get mixed with the whizzers isn't it?
C	yeah well make sure it's like like Mount Everest
A	Mount Everest okay
C	yeah I always think sometimes
C	it looks like an igloo cos there's a big in there
A	you can you can crack one of the eggs
B	okay
C	I'm gonna need more of
C	bicarbonate of soda
A	baking powder
C	yeah
A	you're not
B	shall I just crack it on here?
A	I would crack it into the other bowl just in case it's slightly there you go
C	perfect level teaspoons
A	it could be an off egg for whatever reason so it's always
C	okay
A	thank you
C	tough egg
A	it isn't a
B	just do a big whack
A	hang on
C	yay
C	big whack
A	it's not a tough egg it's an eggshell for goodness' sake
A	well can you get on and do another
C	yeah that one
A	good grief
A	no but it does matter if you get loads of shell in there so just be careful
C	that's why I'm being careful
A	that you don't
C	there
B	I'll
C	that looks funny
B	erm I'll pour it in
A	okay
B	there's a little bit of shell a tiny
C	hey that does look
B	tiny piece it won't make any difference
A	only if it's one really tiny piece though
B	it's one really tiny piece
A	okay
C	hello
C	although
A	ah
B	sorry mama
A	well that's no that's quite important that needs to go in really
C	oh
A	there
B	okay now we need to mix it up
C	can we mix it? mix it?
A	hang on a minute
B	an electric mixer?
C	am I allowed to wipe my hands as well?
A	no cos that's my well I suppose so
C	yay I was getting all wet
A	right well we'll pause while we're doing the whizzing
A	cos we won't be able to hear anything
A	right so we've done that why are you making an indentation on the table?
A	so it says what we need to do can you also keep this recipe on the
C	ah
A	stand because then it won't get mucky half of the mixture is gonna go into one bowl
B	that's not half
A	that's not half?
B	no
A	I think I might cos I'm limited by the size of the spoon
B	is that enough?
A	okay well it's up to you cos you're the person the expert apparently
B	mm mm
A	I think that is right roughly half and half so
C	oh
B	and I get the chocolate
A	and you're having the chocolate one so
C	oh wow
B	so I need to
A	hang on a minute you
C	can I pour the vanilla extract in?
A	yes
C	it smells amazing
A	yes you will need
C	goodbye vanilla
A	thank you
B	and then giving it a little stir
A	and
B	I need to
C	de stir stir
A	one tablespoon of milk and two level tablespoons
C	oh doh
A	of cocoa powder what?
C	I've got some cakey on my army
A	you've got some cake mixture on your arm? well never mind
B	not your army
A	oh this looks
A	no that's not what I wanted is it?
B	no
A	chocolate buttons chocolate drops well what we can use is
B	is it good?
C	oh that smells good
A	yeah it's fine it's not as good as Green and Black's but I don't think we need particularly dark so where's
B	cos I want it like milk chocolate
A	it will be like milk chocolate don't you worry
B	good because if we have dark chocolate I may not like it
A	well you like the black forest gateau I do but yes I understand right so that's one
B	mm
C	sorry you can't have this mum
A	the spoon that's just next to you
C	sorry you can't have this mum
A	well I'm alright
B	I could try and make another version and one which is gluten-free
A	I don't need a gluten-free one that's very kind of you cos I'm not really into cakes at the moment
B	cos that looks like very pale mixture
C	you're into chocolate gateaux
A	it doesn't look like well yeah but I'm not really cos it's got the sugar it's not got too much sugar actually a gateau and if I was going to have it
C	oh
A	I'd have to have lactose-free cream but you can't tell the difference so there's that and you just need one tablespoon of milk now I am going to put in my milk
C	I think I'm going to stir it
A	but you will not be able to taste it
C	oh good
A	I promise you
C	I think I've finished stirring
A	you think you've finished stirring okay
C	yeah look
A	hang on a minute
B	this is
A	just make sure that you have stirred it in all the way though
C	I have
A	right so
B	okay
C	how many level teaspoons was it? one?
A	gently
B	yeah one
A	it was just one
C	uhu
A	it's a proper
C	oh oh that does smell good
A	chocolate mixture and then it's the really fun part
C	this
A	for this stage
C	ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
A	when we've cooked it we will make the
C	hip hip hurray
A	lovely icing
B	it's not as dark but I know why that is
A	that's the
B	is that er that
A	cos it's not gonna be that dark
B	that's a bit blacker
A	right well you haven't actually finished mixing it have you?
B	but I know why
A	why?
B	cos we've put not dark chocolate in
A	no I put cocoa powder in which is what the recipe asked for but we wanted to get Green and Black's because that's a very nice one but we couldn't
B	mm
A	but this will be perfectly fine
B	oh my gosh that is so nice
A	well this one smells pretty nice too
C	can I smell it?
B	can I smell it?
A	uhu
C	oh I'm gonna sneeze soon
B	that is actually quite nice
A	it is very nice okay now this is a crucial part of a marbling
C	yeah you go
A	yes you just basically now you'd need to think about this a little bit okay? erm what you do
B	dollops
A	the vanilla mixture
C	yeah to scrape it all off the
A	but you've gotta alternate them that's the first crucial step you want
C	what does alternate mean?
A	you switch between one and the other
B	like this size mum?
A	yeah
B	is that a good size?
A	yeah do you wanna put it
C	is this is good size?
A	I'd put it there
B	okay
A	erm I would do yours a bit bigger
B	cos I'm like
C	like this?
A	yeah that looks pretty good
B	and do I just like put a bit in the middle as well?
C	I think it
A	yeah anywhere well you can start putting yours in
C	yay
A	but don't put them on top of the chocolate mixture put them next to do you want another spoon?
C	yes please and
A	hang on yours is a little bit runny you're gonna need
C	er could you that's
A	no don't use the small spoon to scoop up the mixture
B	I dunno whether
C	no yours
B	I should put it in
A	wherever you want wherever there's a gap there's not a gap there bit of chocolate
C	ooh
A	there perhaps
C	or here
A	yeah try not to get it on the sides of the baking parchment you want it flat
B	I kind of got some
A	that's fine cos a small amount occasionally
B	it's not dark mum
A	it's dark compared to
B	got a bit on the table
A	sorry?
B	make sure you get a lot of the
B	yeah
A	right
B	in colour
A	well why else am I talking about? good grief
C	the shape?
A	dark doesn't describe shape
B	yes it does
A	that's perfect
B	there could be circle which I light
A	just make sure you get all these
A	bits as well
B	see see if I was to
A	but if not
B	if I did
B	a circle
C	I didn't have any left
B	really really really really
A	you do you need to spread the
B	black thing
A	mm
B	and then I did a square in
A	mm
B	kind of of the sea
C	none left
B	the circle
A	take the spoons out there will be
B	will be black
A	the circle would be black put your spoon very
B	there
A	hang on
C	ba-da
A	right hang on
C	mum
A	any extra bits
C	I say boom chicka boom
A	but you can't
C	boom chicka boom I say boom chicka boom
A	lick anything from here
C	boom chicka boom chicka boom chicka boom
B	cos it's raw cake mixture
A	cos it's raw I used to do that when I was little
A	but and it is delicious the it that raw cake mixture is
A	delicious
C	no
A	you can cos I've just dumped in a whole spatula's worth
C	zee spatula
A	so there's absolutely loads still in this bowl
C	can I sing
A	isn't there?
C	Boom Chicka Boom?
A	no you're not doing any singing cos we're doing a recording and that's about a conversation and not an irritation rhyme that will get in the brain of the person listening I don't think we need to inflict it on anybody else
A	outside the family can you read the instructions
C	okay
A	after we've dolloped
C	er to marble the cake drag the handle of a wooden spoon through the mixture to make a swirly pattern don't be too timid or you'll just have blobs but don't go mad or you'll end up with a pale chocolate cake bake on the middle
A	yeah
C	shelf of oven two
A	yes yes well that's that's giving too many instructions isn't it?
A	the next now this is
C	crucial
A	really important now I've made the mistake before when I've marbled a cake if you overmix it you do end up just with as they said a very very pale chocolate cake now we also have this problem as well that there are big kind of gaps so what I might do is just flatten it out a little bit first
C	oh that one has a bit of chocolate there and that one has a bit of chocolate next
A	it doesn't matter too much what you need to do is
C	yeah
A	is beginning to take shape?
C	uhu
A	yeah?
C	mm it looks brilliant
A	so that's so I've sort of done that
B	I'll try I'll try a bit
A	you give it a go
B	but I'm not gonna do too hard
A	don't do much more there
B	so like
A	erm at the bottom you must be touching the bottom
B	now there's a big bit here
A	there's a big bit in the middle for
B	yeah so drag some of that chocolate on those
C	my go
B	that's
A	give that to give it to
B	okay
A	so this middle section
B	oh my gosh
A	it is beautiful isn't it?
B	can I have another go?
A	well don't do it
B	with that thing?
A	too much that's probably enough
B	mm
A	for that bit
B	okay
A	okay
B	it looks like a tree
A	you know if you see bits that are very
C	that is how Starry Night was created
A	it does look like that doesn't it? the Starry Night picture you know if there are bits that haven't been mixed up yet
C	like here
A	by all means do that and we haven't overmixed it it does very much look like a marble cake at the moment doesn't it? rather than a big squidgy mess
B	there there
A	that is
B	is that good enough?
A	lovely don't you think?
C	mm
B	mm beautiful
A	very beautiful
B	and do we and then do we cook it?
A	now we're gonna cook it and what will happen is that
B	eww
A	I'll give you a wipe in a second I think
A	I've ever seen of a cake so well done
C	including Bake Off and Crème de la Crème?
A	yeah I reckon
C	wow
A	I think you've done a very very good job there cos it does really look like marble and that pattern will stay
B	oh mum there's bits which are not mixed
A	no but that's fine because the point of you look at the cake that's er the the one that's baked in the
B	mm
A	the marbling isn't done all the way through because that will just be too much
B	shall we go and wash our hands now?
A	hang on let erm yeah I'll put it in the oven or do you want to put it in the oven?
C	mm you can put it in the oven
A	I'll put it in the oven okay go wash your hands then
A	okay so the cake is cooled now and now we're going to need to do part one of the icing
A	yeah stand there
B	and
B	sprinkle these on top
A	well first of all we're making a fudge a hot fudge icing
A	and honestly it's one of the best icings ever erm but that means that obviously it is going to be
B	cos if we erm cos if we don't leave it to cool
C	it
B	then when
C	I know why
B	cos all the icing would just sink down
C	erm it's kind of that but the icing would be too runny
A	yes that is the reason why
B	mm
C	it needs to cool down and become a sticky icing not a very very runny one
A	yes exactly cos it will be super super super runny
B	so how many minutes?
B	yes
A	yes?
A	and you're desperate to see the Bake Off as well
B	how many minutes?
A	erm well
A	a good ten minutes I would've thought
C	doh oh
B	oh
A	I know
B	no fair
C	mm
A	I could I don't really want to put it in the freezer cos it will get off those
A	but yes we'll add the chocolate chips when we erm
C	so why don't you want to put it in the freezer?
A	because it will make everything else that touches er it in the freezer defrost that's the only reason why you don't put stuff in freezers normally you know they often do it in baking competitions? but that's because there's nothing else in the freezer erm so if I could clear a bit of space we could do that but I'll try not to get it let it get too hot
B	yeah cos if it is too hot then er when
A	it'll take forever
C	yeah
B	it will just and also if it's too hot it will become more runny and
A	no no it's not if if it's too hot the chocolate will separate which is disgusting it's not nice at all
C	yeah and then you get like really dark chocolate and really light chocolate
A	no it's just that it sort of the fat separates out of the chocolate
C	oh
A	and it looks all like really gloopy mud
C	mm
A	and you can sometimes bring it back
B	mm
A	so I've taken it off the heat now
B	we've got quite a snazzy kitchen
A	we've got quite a snazzy kitchen?
B	yeah with that
A	we've got a very old kitchen
A	do you mean with the extractor fan?
B	yeah
A	snazzy means kinda fashionable
C	no
C	no
B	mm
A	just need
C	I think if we have posh nice things then and there's not really a point cos you don't cos there isn't really a competition of best looking kitchen
A	do you guys want to stir it?
C	it's more the living room
B	yeah I'll have a stir
A	there you go keep stirring it
B	you can stir it first
A	just make sure
A	you don't touch the sides of it cos it's well the bottom cos it's quite it's not very hot but it
C	why do you mean with my fingers
A	with your fingers you can obviously touch the
C	oh
A	no no no I'm just saying
B	cos the wooden spoons are very strong
A	yeah they don't
B	and have to do it have to do it really really really really hot
C	I can't get that stupid piece of butter to go
A	you just need to let it melt
B	no mummy
A	a water bath so I've got a saucepan of lightly boiling water and then I put that erm glass container
B	mm
A	way of melting you can do this in a microwave but it you have to be very careful
B	how good is that?
A	well that's alright there's a bit of a
C	oh I think it was I thought I was butter
A	did you think that was the butter?
B	that was
C	yeah
B	actually butter cos it was yellow
A	oh you're right
C	yeah it was butter
A	well look it's it this is why you don't need to heat it very much at all do you?
B	that is so that looks so nice
C	it's quite
B	and also
C	black l
B	it
C	black but still
B	no
A	it's nice
B	erm
A	I mean do you want to add a little bit more golden syrup to it to make it more sugary?
C	wait can I have a smell?
B	I think so
C	can I have a smell? I'll have
B	yeah
C	a smell
B	a little bit more golden syrup
A	okay
B	that smells quite dark
C	and I got a little bit on my lip
A	yeah I mean you can taste it if you like to see what it
B	not yet because
A	well no taste it now because we can alter
C	can just erm shall I dip my finger on the spoon?
A	no get erm a little
C	that
A	what do you think?
B	mm it's quite dark
C	it has a lovely taste but not very nice aftertaste
B	yeah
A	okay yeah
B	because
C	it's a bit er
A	is it too dark?
B	yeah dark
C	yeah it tastes amazing
B	but then
C	it's just the aftertaste
A	right let me put a little bit in
C	I
B	and then we can check what it tastes nice
C	oh
A	right have you tasted it?
C	nope
A	right give it a little taste
B	I'm a bit lumpy here
A	don't worry about the tiny lump
C	I'll have a try
A	yeah?
C	uhu
A	you have to say yes
B	it is
A	oh it's gonna rain on my washing
B	it's good
A	so it's better now?
B	oh
A	yeah? right what we will do
B	I'm glad we had a taste
A	for it's very important in cooking isn't it?
B	yeah
A	to do that
B	but only tiny taste
A	okay we'll put it in a new container cos that will
C	good
A	and you'll notice obviously the longer we leave it the thicker it will become and then it would eventually set
B	yeah can we watch a bit of TV?
A	no because we're going to watch the Bake Off when you've made completely finished the cake
C	yeah we can watch some TV and then the Bake Off?
A	no
C	why not?
A	cos all you do is ask to watch TV
B	mm
C	we haven't watched any TV today
A	no well nothing it's bad is gonna happen to you is it?
B	please
C	wait is the X Factor on today?
A	you mean Britain's Got Talent?
C	oh yeah
A	yes I believe it is
C	mm
A	and Michael McIntyre
B	only in the night
B	it's only in the night
A	your favourite programme
B	it's only in the night
A	sadly only at night time?
C	yeah
A	well in the evening yes
C	mm wow
A	right let's just see if we can cool this off then
A	so while we're waiting for the erm icing to cool down let's talk about The Great British Bake Off Crème de la Crème so out of the three finalists groups who is your favourite?
C	Baking School
A	yeah it's the Baking School for me
B	Park Lane Boys
A	the Park Lane Boys? so why do you like the Park Lane boys?
B	well just that erm
A	they don't say that?
B	yeah and also one of them's got like an illness but he doesn't say and just steps right up and says I'll do it again even though I'm sick
A	so you're impressed by his work ethic?
B	yeah
A	cos even though he's poorly he's still gonna do it?
B	yeah
A	yeah and you're not swayed at all by the fact that they're gonna make a a chocolate a white chocolate Ferris wheel or anything like that?
B	I am well that's basically one of the reasons but it's not like a
A	oh that's good so and I do like the other group with the very tall head chef and the very short lady
B	mm
A	I think they're very sweet
C	I don't really like them cos they kind of
A	you don't like them cos they were
B	kind of cheating cos they kept on checking like a that we could
A	I don't think they cheated but they were taking the thing is I think they probably could have learnt a lot from each other if they'd had the time to see what the other ones were doing but they didn't change things halfway through but who that's who your favourite but who do you think is gonna win?
C	erm I think that the Park Lane Boys probably do have a chance but the Baking School
A	mm
C	does seem to have pretty good er chance
B	yeah
C	to do it
B	erm
C	because they're
A	the
C	doing it about their life and I think plates and bowls stacked up is probably
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B saw a guy at the circus stacking plates and bowls.	Neutral
A	uhu
unknown_female	what you would get for a
B	also
A	baking school
B	because the Park Lane Boys and the other group were given quite bad marks and it didn't faze them out at all did they?
A	you mean so far at the beginning?
B	but do I want to eat it? no
