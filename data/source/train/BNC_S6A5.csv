A	yeah
C	the first thing I went okay then are you a red or are you a blue? oh I'm a blue he says I say oh not happy this morning then? cos there was like loads of people in Liverpool shirts
A	oh wow
C	I went your cousin? he went yeah
C	he says er he said it was a nice city and all the bits and pieces yeah I said it is I said he says what's he says what's the local derby there? I said well it's fifty miles it's Ipswich and I says what what really gets me I said you your two grounds are quite close to each other there's hardly any
A	is it? oh dear well there there's Liverpool Everton and Manchester that round that area
C	all very close Manchester's only about twenty-four miles away
A	yeah
C	but you've got Tranmere Rovers
A	yeah
C	which is one part of Liverpool
A	that's right
C	Stockport is another another part he says yeah I said well I said there's always been trouble between Ipswich and
A	yeah
C	I said it's a bit like in Birmingham with
A	Aston Villa
C	Aston Aston Villa and Birmingham I said it's horrendous I said you know you wouldn't go and sit next to each other if you were a Birmingham fan and a Villa fan where at least in Liverpool they can still just about do that and they
A	yeah
C	so anyway so then we went off for the day so that was it we had breakfast get in the hotel went off for the day and it was well what shall we do? and I said well we'll walk to the Albert Albert Docks I says and we'll go and do the
A	yeah
C	all in one and er I think we must have been in there around about four hours
A	oh
C	it was really it was
B	yeah
C	Barbados because the parents didn't want them any more
A	well
B	awful
C	you know and the and the
A	that was in the sixties wasn't it?
B	yeah
C	er yeah early sixties it was just after the war as well yeah
A	yeah
C	not that long ago in when you put it into a time frame
A	I remember them all going from from Liverpool to Australia and and they had queues of little kids going
C	yeah and it was like oh and that kind of made you think and some of the buildings on the on the front of Liverpool on the docks Cunard building type thing Cunard building they were one of the biggest people transporting they had children to other countries and you kind of think okay did they make their money out of that?
C	you know
A	yeah
C	you know so that was interesting and then we went through the Maritime and stuff and there was
C	and when you read it it was about homosexuals and things
A	oh was it? yeah
C	and how they felt out at sea they could do what they wanted they wasn't under the jurisdiction of anything and could be free and they
A	that's where you got me over a barrel come from innit
C	yeah things like that
A	yeah
C	and that was like and it like why have they put that up here? I said because that's what happened out at sea that that's telling you about how and they've got this special language that they used
A	yeah
C	and if you used them people knew that you were that way inclined
A	oh I see
C	but you were and you were safe well they shouldn't have that here pardon? did you really say that?
C	am I you know that's part of the history of the maritime and everything that goes with it
A	that's right yeah
C	and then it was like oh and then we got into another bit of a conversation and I
C	are you trying to be a Norfolk girl are you in the sense that you're gonna make comments which you know you shouldn't really be making type thing
A	yeah yeah
C	which are not really appropriate if you are a human being at the end of the day you may you know whatever you think so we gets up onto the slavery floor and I think that really hit home in in some respects just how these big concerns were actually making them money by trading in slavery
A	that's right yeah
C	for the spices and gold and stuff like that
A	the East India Company and the they did all that too didn't they?
C	yeah places like and that was like what? I said yeah I said
A	Netherlands was massive yeah
B	mm
C	France
A	yeah
C	Portugal
A	yeah yeah
C	Great Britain
A	yeah
C	and it was like
A	yeah
C	that's what they that's what they
A	what they did yeah
C	and that was that was really
A	anything about Wilberforce cos he he
C	yeah there was lots of things about the anti-slave people and how they came about
A	yeah
C	and how they they had problems
A	cos it was Wilberforce that stopped the trade the slave trade weren't it?
C	yeah but Liverpool's links with the American civil war as well
A	I expect it is yeah yeah
C	that way links to links to Ireland and stuff so it was really fascinating
A	yeah
C	so we so we comes out and it was like well what we what we gonna do now? well I think we go and do the Beatles tour now
C	oh well what are we gonna do tomorrow? I says well we can do the other half of the Beatles tour and we can do this and it was like oh but I wanna go shopping
C	and I went okay well we can go shopping I said but the shops close at six o'clock no they don't close at eight o'clock do they? I said that's a surprise really? all the shops in that part of Liverpool stay open till eight o'clock
A	yeah?
C	every night so she said I've seen this jumper that I want in Debenhams but they hadn't got my size in
C	and I went oh okay alright I said well we can do that on the way back to the hotel then no problem I said so we'll well what we'll do is we'll walk so we walked to the just round from the Slavery Museum Maritime was one of the Beatles museums

A	oh right
C	so it gave you twenty-four hours and the one ticket actually gave you forty-eight hours
A	oh great
C	if you use it in forty-eight hours so I said okay I said well let's as we got there there was a ferry coming in at four o'clock so I said well let's do the ferry now
A	oh right
C	said let's do the ferry now so we get said so okay so we get on the lines which go on the ferry and it was like as you get on and just as they're pulling away the Ferry Across The Mersey starts to sing
A	does it? yeah
C	and that's quite nice cos that

B	mm
C	and she says well I'm alright I said no you need to talk to me about it and er I said you know we've gotta do certain things I said but you know everything will everything will be alright everything will be alright and er she got back to a t-shirt I got her a t-shirt for the Beatles

A	I mean when you
B	yeah
A	when you have to go for a
C	if you're not
A	it's a bit difficult
C	if you're not used to doing it
A	yeah
C	then it is difficult you know I was I suppose I was lucky just like yourselves in some respects that my parents had a shop and I was
A	yeah that's true yeah yeah
C	stack the shelves and stuff like that from a from a very early age
A	yeah yeah
C	you know and then when
A	yeah
C	so that independence that helped me to get things get things right as always as always
A	yeah it's weird innit? yeah we we've all been brought up with parents self employed and working
B	mm yeah
A	and helping them out haven't we?
C	yeah you know and
A	oh that's a bit weird
C	why why do youngsters today need to go to university? when they don't do the jobs with the degrees that they come out with because it shows people shows employers that they can work
A	well that's true yeah
C	to a higher level than other people
A	yeah
B	we actually talked to
A	yes we did didn't we?
B	yeah yeah
A	we had a
B	cos she was saying she wasn't very keen on it and I said most of the people we know they don't actually do what well ours were a good example
A	yeah
B	I mean photography and selling wine and
A	yeah
B	what's the erm but even
A	and now she's working with children
B	and now she's doing English
C	yeah they kind of they kind of
B	they don't have to
C	no
A	it's just training
B	but it it's erm
A	you know I mean you get really good er trains of thought different trains of thought when you go to university cos you get taught in a different way
C	yeah
A	and that's what's really interesting
C	she you know and it was like well they should be out at work doing work on the job and I said well look I said there isn't much difference between I said there's your we went to school at the same time I said but the school that I went to when you're in the sixth-form it's a comprehensive school they they try to push you to
A	that's right yeah
C	and at that point in time there was grants available
A	there was
C	for you to have so you know you got your grant for this and it and it was a lot easier so that's no different to you
A	yeah
C	I said my sister's children didn't go to university because my sister didn't see the importance of it
A	yeah
C	and my and my nephew and my niece didn't wanna do that and they were too much how wanna do this one that they wanted to get out they wanted to leave home as quickly as possible I said you from what you've said your dad right I've kept you for so long now you're to now you're going out to work to earn your keep I said I'm not being funny I said but back to being Norfolk mentality for certain females
A	yeah yeah
C	I said was I leave school I get a job I find a a guy I get married I have children I stay at home
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	C's sister did not go to university either.	Neutral
C	and that was a big thing for a lot of Norfolk girls
A	yeah well
C	it still is for a lot of Norfolk girls
A	yeah yeah
B	yeah
A	but it is for the for the countryside in general you get you get like in er Lincolnshire I mean that's really sort of self inbreeding if you like you know that type of thing went on and went on in Norfolk went on in the the real countryside whereas you didn't get that sort of thing in
C	yeah
A	it was I mean huh come from
C	yeah you know I said it's about expectations you know as a as a parent I want the best for my children
A	yeah
B	mm
C	because my parents no matter what they did they did the best for they did the best for me
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	C's parents did not help their child.	Contradiction
C	and they they encouraged me to do what I wanted to do
A	yeah
C	my you know I said you were fortunate you had a mum and dad you still have a mum and dad
A	yeah
C	I don't
A	no
[ANNOTATION]	A's parents live in a large house at the top of the hill.	Neutral
C	but my mum went to work so that I could stay on in the sixth-form because well people who stay on in the sixth-form do
A	yeah
C	I worked from a very early age part-time to earn money so I could do things
B	mm
A	yeah
C	I said and then
A	yeah
C	because I did day I did on the job training
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	C will start his first job in two months.	Contradiction
C	for the job that I did and then I took two years out to do my degree course and then in that time I did my other qualifications that I needed to do I said but my parents didn't hold me back and turn round and say
C	because parents don't you know caring parents and parents who want the best for you don't do that
A	no no
B	no
C	I said and to turn round and say that you
A	yes yes
[ANNOTATION]	C has worked hard for their educations, and so have their parents.	Entailment
C	an employer that you can work to a certain level
A	yeah it does yeah
C	you do your A levels it shows an employer you can work to that level
A	yeah
C	you do your degree course it shows the employer that you can do so at the end of most degree courses there are big companies out there who've come along and I've forgotten what they call them but they have they like have a workshop or something like that
A	they do yeah yeah
C	where you go and they're touting for people to come and work for them
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	The other speaker things that companies care about studies.	Entailment
C	er it has a name and at the and at the end you go and
A	yeah
C	and it's well it cost X amount and I says well nothing is free
A	well it isn't any more is it? I mean you used to get er education almost free from the university you went to university
B	mm that was
C	it was
A	even got fed do you?
B	yes we did
C	yeah yeah
B	yeah
C	you know when when I think about when I did my
A	yeah
C	for going to university
B	mm
C	which paid my my fees and all
A	that's yeah
C	and my bursary was because of shortage of teachers in that subject
A	yeah
C	and they gave me an extra bursary
A	yeah
B	mm
C	oh I don't know fifteen hundred pound or
A	something yeah
C	something like that a year and at that point in time fifteen hundred pound was was a lot in the way that
A	well of course it was yeah
C	and the way that I balanced it
B	yeah
C	and I got a tool allowance as well I got a tool allowance each year
A	yeah
C	well I didn't need my tool allowance
A	no
C	because I'd got the majority of the tools I just needed to top it up and used my tool allowance to buy electronic components or things like that that I might need to do something else or to buy wood that I will that they didn't have in the store
C	to make
B	mm
C	but I had you know you know and I'm you know if
A	no
C	you know they have to
B	what I was saying to
C	yeah
B	that is it really worth
A	yes also an experience
B	worth doing isn't it? even I mean it I
A	I think they used to have
B	yours must be difficult to do after a break cos it's much easier to go to sixth-form
C	yeah it was having day release cos I did day release
B	oh I see yeah
C	to do my HND
B	oh right
C	so I did a HN so I did I did an ONC a HND
B	right
C	and then because I'd got the higher national diploma you could convert it to a degree at the college that I went to but that qualification also got you into being able to do your degree course and the experience of working in the school
A	yeah
B	mm
C	but it was hard
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	it was hard
B	yeah
C	you know the easy bit was the teaching bit that was the easy that was the easy bit
B	mm mm
C	the hard bit was actually sitting down each week and writing a thousand word essay each week cos the course that I was on that's what you had to do
A	yeah
C	a thousand word essay and some were fifteen hundred some were two thousand depending on whether it's an A B or C unit
A	yeah
C	and you had to do forty-five A units which was basically one a week
A	yeah
C	and you had to do thirty B units
C	and then you had to do fifteen C units
A	yeah?
C	and you could do them in any order that you wanted
A	yeah?
B	mm
C	as well as your semester work which was like this semester you do graphic design and you do electronics and you do
A	yeah
C	resistant materials so that was one element and then there was another element where you did computing and stuff and you had you had three semesters each year one semester was your teaching practice
A	well yeah
C	plus each year you had a teaching practice and and it wasn't like your six weeks it was a fourteen week teaching practice
A	so you the student going out who
C	yeah
A	some of them were brilliant
C	yeah
A	and some of them we
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	now I was fortunate I suppose cos I was that little bit older type thing I I didn't know that much of an issue but I was but yeah but that's what that's what I did
A	yeah
C	and then you know you move a you move about a bit
A	you do yeah
B	yeah
C	but the experiences that you gain by doing things
A	well this is what it's all about an experience
C	yeah
A	total experience all the way through
B	I don't think I could have gone out to work anyway as I was too young in my head and I'm I wouldn't have wanted just to go to to work and I wouldn't have done
C	well I just find it I just find it but that
B	I needed that education extra
C	but I you know but
A	yeah
C	but my parents were always wanting you know wanting to do something for me if you know I went to private school
B	really?
C	I don't know whether you knew that but I went to private school
A	did you?
C	yeah really
A	huh
C	now to begin with I went I went to I went to
A	yeah?
C	I really hated it with a
A	no
C	one one one person had a corner shop
A	yeah
C	another parent worked for the Co-op Bakery and then there was there was
A	oh right
C	but my dad took
A	yeah?
C	to
A	yeah
C	and then their parents would pick us up
A	oh I see
C	of an evening so dad took us of a morning and my and their parents took it in turn to bring us home
A	oh that was nice of them
C	so it it was quite nice
A	yeah
C	and I went there until I was ten
A	did you? oh well
B	mm
C	so from the so from the age of
B	oh no oh dear
C	and therefore the school wouldn't be opening again in the
B	oh
A	oh
C	and in the September we all had to find
A	a school
C	another schools to go to and
B	oh right
C	my mum couldn't get me in to the school that I should have gone to
A	oh right
C	and I remember there being a big argument
A	mm
C	a real big argument
A	yeah
C	and and it's interesting because the school they wanted to send me where there was spaces was actually part of the Trojan horse thing that happened in Birmingham a couple of
A	oh right yeah
C	twelve months ago
A	yeah
C	so you know we're talking we're talking seventy-two here
A	yeah
C	and my mum says he's not going there and in the end I used to have to catch a bus which was like an eight mile trip to the school that I went to
A	yeah?
C	and where I'd been taken to school every morning all of a sudden on a Monday morning I'm catching a bus to take me to this school to this school
B	oh
A	well yeah
C	and went that way and then that was just a normal primary school then bit like
A	yeah
A	yeah
C	and I
C	to go to school at this private school
B	yeah
A	wow
B	huh
A	huh
C	and then it was like and then I went to a normal comprehensive school
A	yeah
B	yeah
B	they were right
C	wanting the best
B	yeah
A	I never looked for I didn't even know to be honest with you
B	yeah
A	that there was further education when I left school
B	mm
C	it was all apprenticeships though wasn't it?
A	they were apprenticeships yeah and that what I did I didn't know I had engineering apprenticeships of that's what and there's not apprenticeships or they're starting off again
C	they're starting again but they're this was again this was a
A	yeah
C	on an apprenticeship and then you got your course attached to you
A	oh I see yeah
C	to be it's not like you're going let's you know like my dad and and you where you go to the company cos my dad worked for the
A	yeah
C	and and passes and
A	oh right
C	they're all the same company but the
A	yeah
C	where they make generators and things like that
A	yeah yeah
C	so he did his apprenticeship
A	yeah
C	for them
A	yeah
C	a mega big company
A	well
C	yeah yeah
A	and that was a massive massive company
C	yeah
A	I mean during the war they tried to bomb it because they were they were doing erm ammunition at the time then and women were were working there
C	yeah
A	yeah that's a massive company I don't know what happened to it?
C	it's it's I think it's got
A	I suppose that was taken over by some some some
C	I took I had a visit there a few years ago school visit there a few years ago
A	yeah
C	I'm not too certain what it's doing now I think it is actually closed
A	yeah
C	but I
A	yeah? oh right
C	which was which Fort Dunlop was next door to where the Jaguar plant is now which is at Castle Bromwich and Castle Bromwich was where they built the spitfires
A	yeah yeah
C	so during the war and I wish I'd asked more questions but dad never went to war dad dad never was in the army
A	no
C	because he was needed
A	yeah well there was a lot of people like that yeah
C	he was needed in the factories to be actually making the stuff
A	yeah yeah
C	for
A	well somebody had to make it all didn't they?
C	you know because he'd done his because certain engineers didn't go
A	that's right
C	and he never he would he would never say what he did
A	no
C	during the war he just said I made stuff he would never say what he made
A	no
C	now I and that was something that those those people had they
A	that's right yeah
C	what they did
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	you know and he was he was a he was a tool maker
A	yeah we'll that's a very important job a really important job that one is er we had two tunnel makers I was a tunnel maker at one time but er
C	yeah yeah that's what he was and then when the automation came in he was his job title was an
A	oh oh
C	that's that's what he did
B	oh
C	yeah and you kind of think okay so you know he must have been er no I was twelve when he died
A	well very important
C	wouldn't never really had watched talk about it because when did I when did I see him? I saw him when he came home from work on the morning as he was taking us to school
A	yeah
C	I didn't see him of a night time because at six o'clock he got up had his tea and then left to go to work cos he worked nights for forty-five years
A	oh yeah

A	nights yeah
C	nights
A	yeah
