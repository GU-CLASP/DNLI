A	okay so I wanted to tell you about Eddie Izzard because
B	who who?
A	who who? sit down
A	he's a comedian
C	mm
A	and he is running seven no twenty-seven marathons over twenty-seven days
B	oh my goodness that's a lot
A	that is a lot
C	and so a
A	a marathon a day
C	woah
A	so the few years
B	can I pour it?
A	no I'll pour it a few years ago he did forty-seven marathons in fifty-one days I think
B	OMG
A	something something like that but yeah really an incredible thing to do and he is doing that for Sport Relief so I was wondering if we wanted to well we can either sponsor him er and or we could try and do something ourselves for Sport Relief couldn't we? could try and raise some money what do you think?
B	yeah
A	what would you like
B	er we could
C	win the lottery and give all the money to charity
A	hang on er don't talk at the same time
B	we could give some erm we could do a little children's thingy
A	children's thingy?
B	you know a little children's sport's day in the summertime and erm it costs one pound
A	but that that would take a lot of organisation and planning and that would I'm just wondering if there's anything that we could do now really you could do a sponsored silence
B	yeah I think I might do a sponsored silence how would people know you're doing it?
A	because you would tell people we could put it on Facebook and Twitter and things couldn't we?
B	I want I really want to do it today
C	or you could have a sign saying sponsored silence
A	I think you could but I'm just wondering if it could be a sporty challenge that we do
C	I could try and run a huge amount
A	well we could all
B	no
B	you're
A	try and go to er the
C	how long er how
A	er do you mean the distance that people run?
C	uhu
A	I'm not sure actually I think I don't know because the erm grown-up one is five K so I think it might be half of that two and a half K
B	mm
A	but we could get in training for it couldn't we? and I was thinking that that might be a fun thing to do
C	but mum
A	that could be a long challenge that we do erm from now until the summer perhaps
B	okay
A	yeah?
C	maybe I could run the six miles
A	yeah but yeah this is what I'm saying you can't just go and run six miles we'd have to train for it wouldn't we?
C	yeah I'll train and
B	I've mama erm now we're gonna start doing races
C	erm and I'll be quite a bit faster once I've completed my goal
B	mama
C	yeah
A	the one
B	yeah
C	we could all do that
A	well I wonder if I could
B	and then I would run it five
A	and then we could all do it together couldn't we?
B	and I would run this er
C	it's not just running though it's exercising
B	eight times eight laps so
A	that would be a start
B	and I would see how fast I had gotten
A	well it is exercise anyway running but yeah there's it's there's lot of things about running and how I started this nought to five K thing a couple of years ago was when you you know you run for a minute then you walk for a minute and a half so that's I think how we would have to start it with you
B	happy
A	feeling that you're achieving and everything but that that could be a really good thing to aim towards and there is the
A	the trouble with erm
C	or people could sponsor us
A	sorry?
C	or people could sponsor us
A	that's what I mean the trouble with the erm running at
C	messy
A	entertaining
C	and messy
A	and messy
B	but people will get messy I don't want to get messy
A	oh baby girl it's fun
B	no
A	you don't like that idea
B	I don't want to get messy because in the car then I don't like it
A	well they've got showers they've got showers
B	I don't want to be naked in the shower with people
A	you won't be
C	I think I just won't care because I walked around quite muddy in the house like in granny's house don't worry I didn't spill any mud erm er a while ago and I was like and I had jumped in the muddy ditch
A	what? on purpose?
C	yes a load of times
A	bless you
C	is there like a rope swing to one
A	erm they have different erm obstacle and activities every year so I don't know but they definitely have shoots to slide down erm
C	what? like in like those things that go
A	a big big big shoot that goes into water
C	so like that?
A	so you get so actually
B	there's like
A	then they have a massive er massive slide where you go into the water and actually that cleans you up pretty well
B	but
A	is it quite deep? it's not well no because this one will be for children so it's not going to be
B	I can only swim with er goggles on
A	yeah but this is for children so they're going to tailor it aren't they? to to people your age so they're not gonna drown you that wouldn't be very popular would it? if they did that so no it's not gonna
B	how can I see? I can't see
C	only one pound
A	cos you're only gonna be under there for like a couple of seconds
C	only one pound to go
B	so would we have to hold our breath?
A	no course not you're just sliding down into the water
B	does it have is it like swimming pool water?
A	er well I don't know I think it's just probably normal water but it will be in September it'll be warm still it's always really nice in September
B	I know but
A	and you'll be really hot from having run around the track
B	I think I might do that
A	yeah? you're having a think about it?
C	but mum is the shoot going to be like this? or like this?
A	it's gonna be a big wide shoot I think but as I say
C	but will it like have the top
A	it's different every well listen I'm gonna probably do an Insane Terrain in the summer beforehand so I can take photographs and show you what it's like but because it's for children
B	shall I wear a bikini?
A	no you're gonna have to wear
C	yeah you'd get a muddy bikini
A	huh?
C	you'd get a muddy bikini
B	I've got an idea I could wear a bikini erm underneath my clothes
C	and then er just er
A	yeah but you you don't wanna wear too much cos you'll get hot
B	yeah
A	and you know what you'll be like then
C	so then at the very last slide you'll take your clothes off
C	and then your shorts and T-shirt
A	mm?
C	and then er you'll be in your bikini
C	slide down the slide
A	yeah
A	what do you think
B	yeah
A	yeah?
C	mm
A	I'll try and find some photographs but I I think this is the first year that they've ever done it specifically for children
B	mm
A	so I don't think there's any photographs to show you of children doing it but I can
B	then we might get photographed
A	oh yeah you er all get photographs they that's the big thing there they always make sure everybody is photographed so then you can see yourself doing it
B	and you get a trophy in the mud?
A	mm I think you do get a trophy or a medal or something
C	I had er mum I had a erm
B	mama?
A	about this drink? the vitamin drink?
C	mm
A	what was the dream? hang on
C	you don't want
A	right okay
C	yet
B	erm mama you know what? I had a dream which was er like I was at school and
C	I had a dream
A	just for a change
B	I was in my PE kit
A	uhu?
B	and there was like this arena which had loads of mud and water and the water
A	uhu?
B	and if you fall into that one it cleans you so
A	mm
B	you don't have to be all muddy so the first one is a race
A	mm?
B	erm you need to run
A	mm?
B	a track which is really muddy me and some other people won the race and got a medal
A	ah
B	and they take it away if you lose
A	ah
C	what? like Ninja Warrior?
B	no well we only got medals to remember it cos the weakest people erm just fall over just get like a chocolate coin or something so the person
C	mm
B	had to cross some bridges
A	mm?
B	which were like there were two poles to each side
A	two what?
B	two poles
A	two poles
B	so there was like poles
A	I'm saying poles
B	it was like there was a bit there and poles then a bit there a bit and then some poles it was like a zigzag thing
A	mm?
B	but some were so this one was the first height that one was the second height and that one was the second
C	you're making this up
B	I'm not it was in my dream and they and
A	and
B	and
A	watching you do talk very fast sometimes
B	and so were you and then after those people fell off they got
C	mm
B	yeah and then
A	mm
A	mm?
B	and when and then there was this like slide which went up and down and up and down and it went into water and we had to swim across the water as fast as we could
A	mm?
B	so we all did that
A	mm
B	but
A	eliminated or illuminated?
B	illuminated
A	lit up that means
B	yes he like there was like torches around him which lit up
A	okay
C	why?
B	because if if that happens and points someone's
C	how did he cheat?
B	go up
C	how did he cheat?
B	erm he walked across the side when we had to swim
A	I think
B	yeah it was
A	mm
C	my dream has been affected
B	and then
C	infected by your drink don't worry no one gets infected by it
A	and then
A	was that it? was that when you woke up?
B	no
A	okay
B	then there was erm
A	uhu?
B	and
[ANNOTATION]	Someone cheated in B's dream	Entailment
A	mm?
B	they all went and couldn't grab onto the swing and they fell down they had water though and they got like a fake medal and then
B	and then the other people
A	okay
B	they had
C	wait which
A	well the
C	well there are three
A	there are no only one
B	and
A	there's only one
[ANNOTATION]	C had a dream last night	Neutral
B	there's two
A	so there's three?
B	yeah
A	right let me put how long is this story gonna take
B	and
A	okay
[ANNOTATION]	B likes to eat cake	Neutral
B	and then
A	mm?
B	we're on this machine which was like really fast and they fell off and I won
A	great
B	they got like
[ANNOTATION]	B had a dream involving a machine	Entailment
A	excellent
B	it was it said complete this challenge we are going to give you a free and it says you completed this challenge and then I got a free shower
A	you got a free shower
B	yeah and er
A	and you got a swimming pool as well? wow so
B	and I got a recliner seat I got a recliner seat
B	and that was the
A	right so do you know what? I posted on Facebook
[ANNOTATION]	B won some prizes in their dream	Entailment
A	and then my friend
C	that's six
A	mm loads and it yeah but they are amazing seats though aren't they?
C	yes
B	I wanna buy a recliner
A	I know you want your own recliner
C	you should've done
A	what was your quote?
C	I'm not sure what I preferred the seats or the film
C	yeah cos a kid kept
A	cos they're sort of erm on either side aren't they? why are they not?
C	yeah the kid
A	mm?
C	kept pushing my tray out of like towards me
A	oh onto you? yeah
C	or like
A	I don't think he realised though darling cos he was very little
C	well I hadn't realised
A	but that but that well did you say anything to him?
C	no
A	no
C	cos I knew he had started
A	mm that's the problem though rather than say always be on the left-hand side then one is on the left and one is on the right so they touch each other don't they? so that's a bit
A	so they are gonna knock each other
B	I er yeah
A	did you suggest that he should get one?
B	well kind of and we kind of didn't
C	we didn't
B	I really want to bulldoze the house next to us
C	why?
A	to have more room
B	cos yeah cos last night I heard erm
A	he was shouting at
B	yeah
C	and usually I just hear
B	yeah and I heard a thump and it was like
C	hammering something down
B	it was like that
A	he just keeps going
A	no well yes but that wasn't when we first moved here but we've been here five years and three months and so
B	very nearly two
A	and
A	or of course you would've might've been crying in the night and things so
C	I should I think I'm going to be a lovely teenager
B	yeah she really wants to run away she doesn't really like
A	sorry?
B	she doesn't really like
C	mm?
A	that backs onto it you know that always play their music quite loudly in the summer?
C	yes
A	well he had a party on Friday night
C	and got sent to court
A	and well no but he so most people wouldn't even have music that loud anyway around here but the general the law is is that you've got
B	or even have music
A	I know the general law is is that you've got to turn the music down at eleven o'clock at night which is quite late anyway but he didn't so he was still playing his music at midnight and I was so grateful that you guys weren't here cos it would've really you would've had to sleep in my room I think
C	but
A	but he's so kind of selfish but it's a typical kind of teenager thing to do is to have
C	but he broke the law
A	he did well I did ring the police but there's not a lot they can do about it it's not a police matter it's an environmental issue so
C	why is it an environmental issue?
A	well partly it's because police have got lots and lots of things to deal with and that's sort of the last er you know they should be doing other things that are more criminal if you see what I mean but I will I will complain I didn't ring yesterday but I will complain because actually we've never complained have we about that?
C	no
A	and they there have been a lot of times when they've played really loud music
C	yeah like when the time we had to watch Star Wars six that is the only thing I'm gonna thank them for and I'm not gonna thank them for it
C	cos I was really tired in the morning
A	mm
C	even if I did get to see Star Wars six
A	I mean even when it's in the summer holidays it's still rude isn't it? to do that because obviously everyone's windows were open but I mean even over the weekend when everyone's I mean all the windows were shut I could still hear the music from my bed even with my er my door shut as well so it was very loud I just felt really sorry for the
B	yeah
A	the
B	well I'm surprised you didn't go round and shout at them yourself
A	well the problem is is that if you do that then they kind of get all cross with you don't they?
C	yeah and then they turn the music up even louder
A	and some people most people I would say I would go and complain but I
B	mm
B	see what the books were
A	so we're gonna just get the tokens from school and then we'll go into
C	when is World Book day?
