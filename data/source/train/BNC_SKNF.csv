B	yeah it is a bit cold erm
A	it's very cold and there's a thick fog isn't there? was it still on the ground? it was when you went and did you get the bus?
B	well yes I did but not at the time you said
A	oh what time? which bus?
B	well you said you said seven forty-seven yeah?
A	yeah
B	and it eventually came at five past eight
A	oh that's a different bus then
B	well the when I got to the bus stop it
A	oh and that was the five
B	that was the first that was the five A
A	oh
B	and erm
A	mm oh well they've changed the bus timetable in the winter but I don't know or what to
B	yeah well it's
A	but that was on that was online this morning wasn't it? how weird never mind the main thing is you got a bus but you got there in time did you?
B	yeah I got there about erm twenty to and er there were three people waiting apparently one a really nice chap and we started a conversation and we were chatting about this and that
A	oh
B	he was there because he was er his landlady refused to get the heating fixed
A	oh
B	and he wanted to find out what recourse he had and because he was wouldn't let it go she gave him his notice two months' notice and he went down and I saw him when he came out and he says he's stuffed
A	nothing you can do
B	no
A	I think you know it's amazing isn't it what people can do? and there's nothing you can do to make
B	apparently not erm they've got they've got a rent agreement that's and I
A	yeah the landlord
B	yeah she she's in the wrong there you know because she she's has agreed to do what she said she would do but apparently the bottom line is that she's got the rights and he hasn't so yeah
A	and the heating's not been working but is that a boiler or what what is that
B	I don't know he didn't
A	to sort it out?
B	yeah
A	she'll have to when the new tenant goes in surely?
B	I don't know I don't know
A	very odd anyway how did you get on?
B	well erm
A	it's quite a long time isn't it?
B	yeah nearly erm nearly an hour
A	do you want something to eat?
B	mm I would actually
A	what would you like?
B	erm well anything thanks
A	well do you want a sandwich now or do you want?
B	anything honestly
A	porridge or?
A	it's a bit late for porridge
B	a bit late for porridge
A	everything
B	and well yeah that on the on the form you had to fill in before you go and see them er then you're only allowed to tick one of the items
A	yeah
B	so I I ticked benefits and I told her it was er it's the
A	yeah they'll have to be
B	and they came back and said well we'll make an appointment at er for somebody to see you tomorrow so I've got to go back again at half past nine tomorrow
A	oh well at least it's half past nine
B	yeah erm
A	that's good because it's New Year's Eve and erm I thought you might not get anything you know until later
B	yeah yeah
A	well that's good then so did you did they talk about anything?
B	no not really but I
A	no of course not no
B	and er if you are a pensioner
A	mm
B	you cannot claim Jobseeker's Allowance
A	no
B	no so
A	well I I did
B	but what I can do is apply for Pension Credits
A	yeah and top it up
B	yeah so I said you know I want to is it worth erm? and I'd planned to er I told them my plans to to go down to the pension office after I I left there and said would it I would be er doubling would it be necessary? so I was gonna see somebody tomorrow you know and she said well you can go down and tell them what they've said so I did go down to the pensions people
A	you did?
B	and they said oh it's all centralised now
A	yes
B	you have to ring this number
A	mm
B	so then I told him well what I was given the runaround yesterday
A	mm
B	and they said that I'd got to ring er one of the numbers that I rang yesterday
A	mm
B	and
A	did they tell you what to ask for though did they? cos sometimes unless you're asking for the right thing erm
B	yeah yeah yeah well it's to top up pension erm so
A	Ppension Credit
B	Pension Credits yeah so erm
A	well that sounds quite good though doesn't it?
B	yeah well if if I can get to talk to somebody er that's what I'm gonna do now er or after I've had something to eat
A	but it's you know these there is some things that you can
B	well yeah I I suppose you know you've got to two things I learnt today and one is patience and the other is perseverance
A	oh
B	oh
A	mm well I think that's the way of the world unfortunately because what you're dealing with is they're dealing with is people who aren't working and have got time so therefore you know that's how they are they're because you can wait for me kind of approach
B	yeah
A	did you have to wait there then when you went today?
B	no
B	that was
A	yeah
B	you know right next to the law courts
A	yeah
B	and the first two guys are there are two obviously bouncers
A	yeah security
B	I know yeah erm both playing with their phones
A	oh cool
B	and then you see somebody somebody will come up to you and say oh can I help you?
A	mm
B	which is quite nice erm
A	eventually
B	and then you know he told me you know you've just got to phone you you can't see anybody the only person you could see there is somebody who actually pops in and he said he just pops into the office because essentially his job is going around to see pensioners who can't get out
A	oh right yeah
B	so he said it's all got to be done over the phone
A	mm and they'll probably send you forms and then you'll fill those forms in
B	yeah maybe
A	mm
B	maybe anyway I'll find out later
A	so you've got you've got to ring there?
B	yeah
A	what time is that? so right now it's probably?
B	well it's twelve o'clock now so
A	yeah you've got to it's probably lunchtime
B	oh I don't think they that matters about lunchtime erm
A	well
B	cos they got they've got calls from all over the world coming
A	yeah well
B	I expect they have a staggered lunch you know these
A	yeah yeah
B	maybe it's less chance of getting
A	yeah or yeah
B	what are the chances of them replying in the lunchtime? so
B	maybe I should wait a couple of hours
A	yeah well yeah I would say by two o'clock anyone going to lunch is coming back now and don't forget between Christmas and New Year there'll be a skeleton staff
B	mm
A	you know?
B	yeah I suppose people do take holidays now it's like that
A	yeah
B	er policewoman that
A	yeah
B	er filled in the form and she said
A	everywhere you go
A	yeah the twelfth mm well I mean the garage that we go to
B	mm
A	but anyway
B	yeah
A	you're going back tomorrow
B	mm mm
A	and erm
B	well I'll have a clearer idea of erm
A	mm where to
B	what I'll be entitled to
A	yeah so tomorrow it's a specialist person is it?
B	yes it's a
A	mm
B	yeah
A	and did you have to explain about your circumstances like what you've been doing and you know?
B	mm yeah yeah vaguely without going into much detail
A	I mean did you tell them about
B	yes they asked me and I said I've got family in
A	yeah
B	erm so I expect they'll want
A	well that
B	take take people
A	you might get child benefit
B	well
B	maybe if I can prove she exists
A	well that's why I said birth certificates
B	yeah but it's in Chinese you see
A	well you know
B	because I I
A	they can be translated
B	but I have got erm the form that says she's registered with the British government as erm British father
A	mm well you you need to have a copy of her birth certificate and they will translate it over here
B	ah
A	if need be and that that's why I said to you you need it as proof and you could be I mean I don't know how much erm family allowance is but it's quite a lot about ten pounds or more it might be even
B	is it?
A	I don't know it might be even eighteen pounds a week which is a lot if you've got to pay school fees
B	mm
A	and
B	well we'll
A	that's the way to go
B	that's
A	what you need to find out about also have you they asked about
A	yeah
B	it's it's all done on a on a scale here see there look
A	mm okay god it's hard to follow isn't it?
B	mm
A	the Pension Credits chart for people age you're not single actually
B	no well the different
A	yeah
B	well
A	people aged sixty-five and over
B	yeah but I'm not a couple either am I?
A	no so you god
B	well my income will be just what I'm being paid
A	on the pension
B	on the pension at the moment so
A	yeah
B	I'm pretty
A	and it starts at a hundred
B	yeah a hundred yeah
B	yeah
A	but you're below the scale
B	mm I'm
A	you will get
B	I'll get something
A	well yeah mm it's that
B	and they asked me if I'm paying any rent and I said no I'm just er staying with my sister at the moment
A	but you or what you have you asked them will you get housing benefit if you want to take a flat you know?
B	yes yeah and and
A	well
B	I said what?
A	forget that forget that they
B	I saw a thing on the TV recently er that said in in
A	yeah well they're mainly people with children and
B	yeah
A	you know and and they have to be overcrowded if you can put your name down on the housing list here we're not overcrowded
B	mm
A	so that's you know that's what they would say well you've got rooms you know?
B	mm
A	where you're living you've got a bedroom to yourself if you put it down as
B	well he's he said he he
A	he would
B	he could yeah he would do that but that would mean erm that it would show up that he's he's getting an unearned income or something like that you know er and that and that that would
A	well only only
B	that would actually affect and also it would affect his rates because
A	yeah
B	that would be more than one person living in the house
A	yeah
B	and he said you can do that
A	yeah yeah which isn't a huge amount though
B	well I'll have to find out when I see him
A	erm it's erm it's what they call erm community tax tomato sauce?
B	please yeah since you told me the benefits of
A	tomato sauce absolutely I mean I don't eat it myself I can't stand it but everyone tells me it's do you want a cup of tea?
B	lovely
A	camomile?
B	er peppermint please
A	peppermint okay
B	mm
A	so it won't affect his income
B	no but it will affect his rates
A	yeah it would affect his er his erm community tax the only thing is of course he's got his nephew staying there and he might not want that to be
B	well technically his his his property is four to six actually
A	mm right oh right
B	and where his nephew's staying there's a door that leads into the
A	other room
B	the other room where his bedroom is
A	right
B	he's got a bedroom and that is technically number four
A	right
B	and
A	right okay
B	mm well
A	and you pay rent and get housing benefit that would be the thing that would be the ideal
B	he showed me his new New Year's resolutions for two thousand and thirteen
A	oh major New Year's resolutions
B	yeah for two thousand and thirteen
A	oh for two thousand and thirteen
B	and that erm one of them is to erm do his property up at least
A	yeah
B	one day a week
A	oh that's good
B	and that I think it's going to be on his list of
B	and I told him yeah I told him I'll be you know more than happy to help out
A	yeah give you something to occupy yourself
B	mm
A	and actually probably be very good for you because using physical energy makes you tired and sleep well

A	yeah that's one of the things though when you when you erm can't sleep at night you don't want to get up in the morning but if you get up in the morning at least you're tired at night you know what I mean? you might yawn a lot during the day but I I know that unless I keep my routine well I wouldn't sleep I I'm awake later at night now than I ever used to when I was working mm
B	mm
A	yeah and that Dell computer that's what keeps me awake on the computer my laptop and and they say the blue light from emitted from er screens is erm prevents sleep

A	mm
B	but
A	mm but they'll be looking at that
B	yeah but I I
B	well fair enough yeah
A	what you could say is that she's living in it
B	yeah
A	has has it
B	we did actually well after we bought the first one we got a a a loan
A	mm
B	I suppose you could call it a mortgage but er for because we didn't have quite enough to buy it and it's it's weird you can the erm the Chinese they they've got a can do attitude to everything you know?
A	mm mm
B	and there's no way they're gonna give me a loan
A	no
B	but
B	yeah
A	how weird
B	so they yeah so that we could get the loan
A	good grief how weird is that? because she's not
B	I I wasn't eligible and er
A	yeah we can give you a loan
B	and and she wasn't working so she suddenly became employed
A	mm and so no paperwork or no nothing for it
B	no
A	it was just
B	just to
A	put it on a paper bit of paper
B	yes just
A	fill in the form tell a little lie and you can have what you want what would happen if if the loan hadn't been repaid then? what do they do about that?
B	well they repossess the property
A	yeah I suppose so yes so it wasn't a loan against the the property then rather than just a personal loan?
B	well it must have been they wouldn't have taken a chance of
A	mm
B	of doing that but the the Chinese are trying to cut down on the amount the banks are giving cos all the banks are underwritten by the government
A	cut down on the amount of?
B	money they're lending
A	oh right yeah yeah mm they're all under well it's a bit like here ours are aren't they really?
B	well yeah
A	more or less
B	more or less aren't they?
A	yeah
B	I mean the RBS and
A	Lloyds
B	Lloyds yeah
A	our bank Lloyds
B	no mine is
A	is it? yeah yeah well yeah I do know that yeah
B	no it's TSB

B	well I don't know why when I I got this started when I came over erm for my sixtieth and er
A	oh so you didn't have a bank account here
B	no I don't know why I went to Lloyds TSB I can't remember but it doesn't matter I mean
A	Lloyds cos you were down in
B	well no I wasn't I wasn't in
A	where?
B	because I was staying with you and
A	not here but it was at
B	yeah but I didn't have a bank account then
A	no but what I'm saying is
B	oh I see oh oh for my address cos yeah my address
A	yeah yeah
B	then was
A	yeah so erm
B	but I don't know I don't know yeah I can't remember the reason why I chose that
A	mm I bet that would be why cos it's just nearest and the easiest erm what was I going to say? oh god it's cold are you cold?
B	mm
A	the heating on freezing freezing sneezing I'm gonna do a shepherd's pie for tonight
B	mm
A	I think cos it's cold it makes it warm and it's nice and easy to sort out so what else have you got to do today then is that it?
B	er that and I've got to write to
A	got to write to
B	I haven't checked yet
A	I haven't got that email from you
B	really?
A	yeah and you said you sent me an email or something?
B	I sent you two
A	yeah and I haven't got them something's wrong with the email address that you've got for me and I sent you one last night cos I I when I went to bed I looked on my laptop and checked my emails and emailed you back er
B	well I'll tell you why cos since
A	it should come up on your phone shouldn't it?
B	since
A	that's your phone there
B	since
A	you can't you can't do it
B	since I erm I've got to wait until
A	mind you it wasn't Gmail I sent it to
B	no no
A	Hotmail
B	yeah that's right
A	mm I don't feel you but I haven't got your Gmail erm

B	where does she work again?
A	she works at
B	mm
A	a call centre hates the job but it's quite well paid she's been there I don't know quite a long time now
B	mm
A	about fourteen years and she keeps hoping they'll make her redundant and then she'll look for a job nearer
B	I suppose she should consider herself lucky to have a job in these days
A	mm
B	what is unemployment like here now?
A	sorry?
B	what is unemployment like?
A	not bad now it's come right down you know it's erm I don't know exactly it's the young that are unemployed
B	yeah
A	predominantly and that's why they're trying to develop thousands more apprenticeships
B	well well absolutely and so they should
A	mm
B	I think you know it went out of fashion for a while
A	that's
