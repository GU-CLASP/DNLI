A	she must've heard it at school
B	yeah
A	yeah
A	family allowance should be for us not for them
B	mm
B	mm
A	and she kicked em to pieces cos she didn't like em
B	oh yeah
A	didn't do her any good did it?
B	no
A	she had to wear them

A	yeah
B	I don't know
A	no
B	mm
A	well
B	yeah

A	but you're not
A	not at thirteen years old anyway
B	not throughout your school it's silly
A	not throughout school no but I mean they might start wearing them at er
B	I don't actually think the school would
A	no course they wouldn't
B	no
A	but maybe
B	maybe they wouldn't allow much
A	not stiletto type heels
B	but then everyone's more sensible now now trainers are really fashionable anyway
A	that's brilliant that is ain't it?
B	yeah
A	cos they are sensible shoes that keep the feet
B	mm
A	really
B	although they did say no trainers at one time then they had to allow it didn't they?
A	yeah
B	I think
A	but maybe they don't because I think
B	yeah school shoes isn't it?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	this is where boys come come out better than girls ain't it? girls want to be all fashionable and what have you and boys've got shoes
B	mm
A	shoes shoes
B	that's right
A	there's no there's nothing really out of the ordinary with boys' shoes is there?
B	no
A	lace-up buckles or slip-ons
B	mm
A	they all look the same
B	wonder how
A	yeah they can can't they? yeah
B	yeah
A	well that's the problem er this is why they say school uniform's the best thing that they can wear
B	mm
A	because nobody's better than anyone else are they?
B	that's right
A	yeah
B	I can't wear that I wore that yesterday
A	yeah
B	people will know I wore it yesterday
B	mm
A	yeah
B	mm
A	well you had to wear them silly hats didn't you?
B	er

A	you've
B	I might have
A	it's in the shed I think
B	cos you like green anyway so

B	didn't like it
A	oh yeah
B	got it debobbled
B	but not not many girls wore boaters
A	well it does really yeah
B	they don't have hats any more do they? anywhere I don't think

A	no just just the
B	was that all?
A	that was er the catchment area for
B	no other choice?
A	no
B	mm

B	in the whole of
A	well I expect there was
B	no
A	but ours was the
B	was there one at
A	that's a posh school
B	well was there a grammar school at

A	oh yes you did
A	that's what we thought
B	yeah
A	okay
B	right
A	how to talk properly
B	what a shame I wonder where you'd've been if you'd've gone
A	well I'd've probably been prime minister now
B	I don't think so
A	why not?
B	no you don't
A	head of the Green Party that's me
B	you probably wouldn't've learn a lot more
A	well I tell you what I would rather
B	you learn other things as well
B	well you'd've learnt all the
A	Latin
B	that's only part of it isn't it?
A	well this is what put us off
B	they still do woodworking and stuff
A	they didn't do a lot in grammar schools
B	well I did er
A	they were academics
B	but I did art needlework and domestic science and things
A	well there was that there was that

B	all of them
A	oh
B	yes
A	what did you get in maths?
B	I got an A in maths
B	it's been a long time
B	no it's only when I did pure maths that I lost it a bit
A	oh dear yeah
B	no pure maths is totally different
A	did you get paid for it?
B	no
A	why not?
B	well you just help people out don't you?
A	oh god
A	well of course
A	that's right
B	oh I just help people out I like I I like
A	oh I I have to say that you're a lot better at working out than I am
B	but yeah
A	yeah
B	how to logic and things come into it I think
A	yeah well we had arguments with our teacher well not arguments but
B	yeah well you don't don't use it really
A	and he said well it's not the use it's to get your mind working
B	yes
A	and that's what he told us
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	mm
A	yeah
A	oh god
B	C minus D
A	yeah
B	gets complicated but
A	equals two E
B	so what is A? or what is C?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	you have to think
B	really hard yeah
A	yeah and er that was
B	mm
A	the whole point of algebra
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B had high grades in Algebra at school.	Neutral
B	mm
A	whereas er we we couldn't see that
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	she was told she she has to
A	yeah
B	be able to chant them
A	we had to chant them
B	mm
A	every day
B	yeah
A	and that's really weird because chanting makes you remember
B	mm
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Chanting is not efficient to memorise.	Contradiction
B	keep singing the words of a song you get them
A	and then our teacher used to go
B	yeah
A	finger and say
B	we used to play a game called buzz
A	yeah
B	you buzzed when it was like seven or fourteen or twenty-one
A	oh I see
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B used to play the buss game.	Entailment
B	or whichever name you were
A	well yeah
B	mm yeah
A	that's how they try to do it nowadays make them into games don't they?
[ANNOTATION]	Games are very much implemented at schools nowadays.	Neutral
B	mm
A	so that people learn through games or fun rather than through
B	yeah
A	oh
B	I suppose most stuff you learn through er a bit of a play don't you?
A	well yes
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	It's impossible to impart to someone knowledge with game methods.	Contradiction
B	you realise what you have to do
A	yeah well I mean
B	yeah
A	have to score
B	mm
B	oh dear
A	and I thought I'm not gonna get hit by that
A	I didn't get picked for football
B	you run away from the ball then?
A	I
B	yeah
A	and we were put on the tennis tennis courts
B	mm
A	cleaning up the leaves on the tennis courts
B	it's very bad isn't it? when they
A	yeah
B	they do pick the same people for teams
A	er all the time
B	so if you weren't any good in the beginning you'll never get a chance
A	no
B	to get good
A	no you don't
B	oh right
A	and I though oh you big
B	but there
A	no
B	cos there's never gonna be exactly the
A	no
B	I don't know if they've changed it now but you should all be able to play shouldn't you?
A	you should be
B	mm
A	but you see the two favourite boys was
B	yeah
A	that nobody wanted
B	yeah
A	and we went off cleaning up the tennis courts
B	mm
A	and that's how it was
A	it was unfair
B	yeah
A	but then the teachers the the the sports the PE teachers then were they wanted er to play you know a good game
B	yeah
A	they didn't want someone who who dawdled around
B	that's right
A	yeah that's right yeah
B	so if you're if there are any odd ones
A	mind you I got picked to run for for er
B	mm
A	I got picked for for
B	oh right
A	to run for
B	mm
A	and I was running against two other people
B	right
A	and I come last
B	right
A	so when I got back to to school they said er how did you get on where did you come and I
A	out of three of I was
B	dear
A	so ashamed of coming last I didn't want to tell em
B	you can't say I don't know though it sounds as though you're stupid
B	and they believed you of course?
[ANNOTATION]	A was the third out of three.	Entailment
A	no
A	no course they don't they weren't as daft as I was
A	yeah
B	well
B	instead of I don't know
B	he doesn't know what he's doing
A	no
[ANNOTATION]	They were competing against two other people.	Entailment
B	probably in a different race

A	no no but if you had it in your pocket you could just stick it in your in the spoon and stick the egg on and run yay
B	ah
[ANNOTATION]	There were nets in the obstacle race and they would never tangle up.	Contradiction
A	sack race
