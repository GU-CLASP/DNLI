A	of being a
B	lawyer
A	the clerk of a justice person yeah and in order to erm
B	oh
A	I dunno if it'll work
B	okay
A	erm to to take up writing
B	yeah
A	but I think I liked it because she had this thing erm and I did start doing you know and I
B	yeah
A	before we came here I was quite fixated on research for here and it was
B	yeah yeah
A	impending a bit more and more and more and there was like a deadline
B	yeah
A	and there will be a deadline again cos I've got house-sitting from the third of April but that's a month of not having to do anything so one of the things I would like to do is to have this project
B	yeah
A	make a list of the things that you don't like
B	yeah
A	but it's not I think it's phrased a bit better than that things that make you feel good things that make you feel bad and then things that make you feel in an atmosphere of growth erm cos she was like you can't just have all the things you like erm you have to have an atmosphere
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Person B is not sure that what is the idea behind collecting things that he likes or hates	Neutral
A	of growth or you don't you're not satisfied then
B	yeah yeah exactly
A	and I remember how wonderful it was so I woke up one Sunday at like five AM
B	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Person B is thinking that waking up early is good for health	Entailment
A	and I got up
B	mm
A	and went on the patio and started making a list of what I liked
B	mm
A	and it was so much fun and then I remember
B	mm
A	and it was such a great day erm but then the idea was right so you've got to try and include more of the things that you like
B	mm
A	get rid of some of the things you don't like as far as you can
B	mm
A	and what are you gonna do for your atmosphere of growth? I bet there's more to it I'm just that's how I remember it so I started doing it and the thing is like I had a list of about eight hundred things that I liked
B	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Person B want to have a sandwich to make the atmosphere better	Contradiction
A	so I couldn't you can't start doing them all so she had
B	like what? out of interest
A	erm there was such a wide
B	do you mean on a mundane level or up to bigger things? like from reading?
A	all levels yeah like
B	reading swimming?
A	waking up early
B	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Person B is thinking of the thing that Person A is saying	Neutral
A	swimming
B	uhu
A	erm coffee
B	yeah
A	erm like it's a shame I don't have the list with me but it all like came to me that morning and I was just oh like fresh air
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Person B agrees with Person A that it is ok if he gave the list in the morning	Neutral
A	erm
B	simple things
A	not being oh and then on the like what I don't like side being late
B	uhu
A	cos it just makes me feel like shit erm and other stuff like that so so then it was like she I then I just wished that she was there because she had this fabulous plan of twelve months and each month she was tackling particular bits
B	mm
A	and I just fell short there because I was working and I just didn't really have time
B	mm
A	and and you've got to be careful not to let it become a chore
B	mm
A	so because you're like holding yourself accountable that's how you're gonna get it done
B	mm
A	it's a danger that you end up going oh
A	be on time and I've got to
B	yeah
A	so and then ticking it off
B	yeah yeah
A	so I realised I'd done it wrong at first cos I'd ended up with a more jobs
B	right
A	erm but I eventually got it right but by the way this is quite short lived so
B	mm
A	I chose which ones to do that month so I chose something like writing erm cooking and I dunno something else and then three things to get rid of
B	yes
A	and then I sort of like forgot about it for a bit but I I remember one day going oh crap I didn't do the thing and I looked back and I had been doing those things
B	oh
A	so it had
B	so it had it anyway?
A	yeah it had infiltrated what
B	right
A	I was doing
B	right right right
A	and I would like to do that again I know it's really like simple but it was so good cos I thought do you know what?
B	effective
A	I love going to a café and reading my books I'm gonna do that on Saturday
B	mm
A	rather than just going oh I never manage to get round to having the reading in the café thing
B	like make it an a purposeful thing?
A	yeah erm and then the thing with the atmosphere of growth is probably my writing
B	right
A	so what do you think?
B	excellent
B	because erm what the theory of everything or the many books that I've read on the theory of everything as you know shall we come up here? erm dunno where I thought that was a part of the whole thing
A	yeah
B	but erm what do you think? I mean
A	do
B	I don't mind carrying on if you're happy
A	do you feel like we're gonna get to that side or not?
B	I dunno
A	or do you think we have to get back in the car
B	maybe stick our heads round here
A	and see
B	see
A	and then yeah
B	if there's no sign then we'll have to maybe go back
A	go back and then see it again
B	right so
A	whoops
B	no what I was gonna say to you
A	we're accidently just walking along a road
A	yeah
B	it's completely lovely erm right so what I was gonna say to you it sounds like a similar thing
A	oh
A	maybe this is what this is for
B	it's it's
B	oh erm yeah write down at the end of the day three things or four things that were really good
A	oh yeah
B	and then what happens is is you look back at your day and you think yeah that was a good day and that was really like this was nice and it makes you feel better then when you go to sleep
A	and you maybe do find things where you thought
B	yeah
A	that everything
B	well it
A	had gone to shit but when you think about it there was a couple of things
B	and the idea is this it's one of the methods you can use to cultivate a attitude that's a happier one
A	yeah
B	you know? because
A	yeah
B	so if you make yourself and this is so true and I I don't mean to constantly bring up certain people but I have a friend who is very negative
B	and everything is wrong
A	I still like
B	yeah I do she's she's fantastic but you know when you look at someone and you can see
A	yeah
B	like you can totally see how it's
A	but I was getting like that definitely I was so negative
B	well you you are not negative
B	cos this this is the problem with
A	yeah
B	and then that becomes their personality personality cos they think oh
A	it's funny
B	it's funny when I'm like this so I'll do it more and everyone'll
A	yeah
B	think I'm funny and it becomes your trait
A	yeah
B	the same thing is with you like you know how you would have bought all warm clothes? and it would be scorchio
A	yeah
B	in February
A	yeah
B	and you would have
B	what was the other thing just now?
A	got a a a fly up my arse
B	yeah while you were having a wee and all these things
B	like yeah that would happen to
B	do you see what I mean? it's it's like that
A	oh
B	and then it but that becomes self-perpetuating then so then you think oh yeah of course that would happen to me whereas
A	yeah
B	there are people
A	yeah
B	and it does cos you expect it but
A	so I haven't got a fly in my pants
B	you probably have this is what I'm saying
A	sure that I should have like mentioned that
B	it's anonymous innit?
A	cos either er
B	probably anonymous
A	there is one or and that's just typical me or I just think there is one so I should think there isn't
B	yeah
A	and then it'll stop itching
B	yeah because the worry
A	there isn't one there isn't one there isn't one
B	the worry
A	cos at the moment it's probably laying its eggs and
B	yeah up your arsehole
B	yeah
B	yeah it totally is
A	do you think it's possible to like cut bits?
B	that bit out?
A	no
B	what what bit?
A	the you know
B	yeah it is because erm
A	no don't give me any evidence
B	okay
A	we'll be awake all night or going to hospital
A	sorry could you just check?
B	yeah but do you see how it works?
A	yeah
B	do you see what I mean?
A	oh it's so annoying it's all down to me
B	that's what
B	that's what she laughs at
B	she goes and on top of all this it's my fault
A	do you know what though? it's funny when I'm with you but when I'm on my own it's actually not funny
A	it's like it gets you really down
B	what? what does?
A	all the like
B	the worrying?
A	yeah
B	erm
A	got to like the end of the afternoon because now it's manageable the heat
B	I just can't believe how much like Cornwall it is and I love Cornwall
A	and then all we've got to do is erm
B	oh
A	come all the way back
B	exactly
B	you know you was talking yesterday about your lovely summer with
A	yeah
B	and all that I can remember and you know how you said you used that to think of sometimes when you're a bit fed up and it cheers you up and everything?
A	yeah
B	well I was thinking what have I done? and I think one of the best summers
A	well yeah because I asked you yeah
B	one of the best summers was me and
A	oh
B	like for the whole summer and we did pretty much
A	really?
B	pretty much for the whole summer
A	oh wow
B	and she I'd finished uni for the year I think I'd had I totally finished it? or it was last? second year? I dunno so I had the whole summer off
A	first uni?
A	yeah
B	like I got over the panics a bit erm and yeah we just had a lovely summer so and we came down and stayed at my nan's so we had somewhere to stay and then my nan came down and stayed sometimes and my sister came sometimes
A	isn't it amazing?
B	and
A	how lucky is that? don't that's
B	of course
A	did you feel really lucky?
B	I did I did I did
A	oh
B	and it was really exciting
A	yeah
B	it was really really exciting and the thing is though this is what I'm saying it should all be like that
A	yeah
B	and if it's not it's cos we've done something or allowed things to not be like that
A	yeah
B	it's our fault well that's good cos that means we can do something about it
A	cos on the one hand I kind of think it can't all be a holiday but I but on the other hand I think that's not what is meant it means that so for example when I was in Frankfurt I was like I don't want to live here and as much as possible go to Cornwall
B	yeah
A	I want to live in Cornwall
A	and I know that not everybody can live where they went on holiday but that's what my mum and dad did and I suddenly realised this one day
B	what? lived
A	cos
B	where they went on holiday?
A	cos by the way I was thinking if I just bought a place somewhere
B	mm
A	in England I could go there loads and I just quickly before I'd even thought it through I was like it's too much I can't keep going over there so and I've got to build a life where you are
B	uhu
A	but basically what happened to my mum and dad was erm
B	uhu
A	and because they were up north when they used to go on the ferry they had to stop so they one night before the ferry
B	mm
A	whereas nowadays it's just straight on the ferry from where we live but
B	mm
A	so they stopped in
B	mm
A	and they loved it so much
B	in
A	in
B	where's
A	well
B	oh so it's where you are
A	is nearby
B	oh I
A	no no
B	like
A	erm
B	right
A	and erm
B	they loved it
A	so they decided
B	what? based on one or two
A	to move there
B	trips?
A	yeah they were like we just love it here
B	yeah
A	why don't we move here?
B	yeah
A	so literally and this was a massive undertaking it wasn't just like oh we're hippies let's just move it was like dad was
B	yeah
A	erm a lawyer a new lawyer and he had to find a job in
B	in
A	do you know what? my mum always says this she's said it several times so she'll go where's
B	yes
A	and then my mum always says do you know we really wanted to live in
B	really?
A	so we had to go down the other side of
A	so imagine if they could have afforded it I could have grown up near you
B	oh imagine
A	but we only were there when I was born until I was two so hang on so we went to so we lived in
B	where is
A	yeah it's kind of like
B	nearer to
A	and erm so
B	so you were born though where?
A	I was born there in
B	oh so you're really not a northerner at all?
A	no but
A	but then what happened was when I was two they made a boob they moved back up north
B	right
A	so my mum said I'm too far away from my mum I want to go back
B	mm
A	and I think something else happened like they were visiting and they started to get these thoughts that they should go back so they went back up north
B	mm
A	and they both say big mistake knew straightaway
B	knew straightaway?
A	moved back up to
B	right
A	so actually did start off with a northern accent
B	oh
A	which I quickly grew out of cos when I came back down I just learned
B	yeah
A	not on purpose but just
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	erm
B	so
A	yeah
B	I didn't know that
A	and they and then they were like we should never have come back here cos our our hearts down there
B	why didn't they like it out of interest?
A	I think
B	what was wrong?
A	really they
B	right
A	they
B	what was wrong
A	erm
B	yeah
A	cos I don't wanna say
A	cos it there are lots of wonderful things about
B	yeah
A	up north but I do think that possibly a part of it is that up north is a bit more downtrodden and down south
B	yes
A	is a bit more wow we are actually like on holiday
B	right
A	I don't' know how to explain it properly I mean for example my auntie and uncle they live in a wonderful part of Yorkshire and it's really beautiful
B	yeah
A	but it is a little bit bleak it can be quite bleak even though I've in in even though I think it's great so but it's
B	okay
A	something terrible then
B	no no no
A	I was gonna say compare
B	or
A	no that's a totally wrong comparison but yeah
B	right
A	and that's when they moved to
B	have you always lived in that house in
A	er yeah first we were in
B	yes
A	and it was difficult like my dad had to then find another job down south and it was really difficult and he had to move down first and we didn't
B	mm
A	come down till later and then he had to find a house and
B	mm
A	it was extremely difficult to find a house
B	uhu
A	er because they were selling a house up north and buying a house down south so the difference
B	mm
A	in price was massive so
B	and also that is hard enough now with the internet
A	yeah
B	like imagine doing it then when you had to go and like
A	yeah
B	and make appointments and that's how you saw a house
A	he actually had to do it in person
B	wow
A	but the other thing is we had to have like a skanky house because it was all that could be afforded
B	yeah
A	based on the other house sort of thing and my mum
A	she's always like oh I hated that house
A	erm
B	no you should
A	that you know they followed their dream and
B	yes
A	it made me think when I was thinking about living where I wanna live instead of
B	yeah
A	just trying to get there when I'm off work
B	but do you know where you wanna live now? it's like
A	well
B	you're still deciding though innit?
A	in definitely England
B	definitely England?
A	I know that I say everywhere we go that I wanna live there but
B	I know you don't though not really
A	it's just because I I
B	yeah what you mean is you'd like to have the option in to visit anywhere you like
A	but do you know what else I think it is as well?
B	where are we going
A	still not there are we? is it there? erm the other thing is that I don't think it's as simple as
B	mm
A	I think it's also the sea
B	mm
A	like sometimes you can't totally work out what the elements are but for example
B	yeah
A	erm I could get a really cheap place to live in like Lincolnshire or Cumbria
B	yeah
A	and it's beautiful like where
B	right
A	so and to me I really wanna be by the sea so there are like different different like I don't wanna be in a city working myself to death
B	yeah
A	stressed out have to go to a five star hotel at the weekend just to stay alive
B	yeah
A	erm it doesn't even touch the sides because I'm back in on Monday
B	yeah
A	er and then
B	yeah
A	and living three hundred miles from it no I want to be live near the sea
B	yes
A	but I know that a lot of people might think that that's erm babyish and you can't do that like you have to
B	bollocks
A	have the job in the city and that's why I'm
B	no
A	going to try and do it this year differently
B	let me tell you this really really good story that I read somewhere so there's this Harvard graduate businessman who'd been working his bum off working his bum off working his bum off went to go
B	to this little Spanish or Mexican I can't remember erm village by the sea and it's like this just peaceful
A	oh
B	chilled out nothing happening quiet as anything and he met this fisherman there who would go out every morning and catch like a few fish
A	yeah
B	so he'd catch a few and he'd swap some with his friends sometimes like for other things
A	yeah
B	and one night he bought he tried some of this fish off the fisherman he bought it or had it cooked at his restaurant where he was staying or whatever he said oh that is amazing that fish he said it's the best fish I've ever had he said why don't you why don't you get more fish? like go out more get more fish then you could sell more of them
A	this is the Harvard guy saying this?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	the businessman why don't you get like and then when he said to him so what do you do every day? he said I go out and get my fish he said I get a couple of myself for dinner with the family and then I sell a couple to my friends and we swap it for like other things that we need basically
A	yeah yeah
B	and he said and then what do you do? he said well then I he said spend the afternoon with my family and then he said and then what do you do? he said well in the afternoon I in the evening I go out with my friends and we go to a little house and we have a singsong
A	nobody's
B	sometimes I have a drink
A	nobody's stressed to death
B	no
A	having to watch box sets because they're so stressed
B	that's it so
A	oh
A	isn't it great? I love the promise of it
B	yeah
A	yeah so
B	so erm he said so that's what you do? he said yeah that's what I do he said well why don't you get some more fish right and then you can sell these fish then you could buy a bigger boat right?
A	yeah
B	then you can buy a bigger boat you've got it and you'll get even more fish and you can start supplying all the restaurants
A	and retire at thirty-five
B	well this is it
B	then you could spend time with your family and your friends
A	already do that
B	that's what I'm saying
A	yeah
B	that's the moral of the story it's what would you do with all this money? why do you want all this money?
A	yeah
B	but
A	apart from needing those houses on the top of the San Fran hill which I don't want any more cos I'm gonna live here
B	but no but the point is this really
A	yeah
B	this is even better
A	this is what I imagined
A	and also is the point a little bit like stop wanting stuff because
B	well it this point is what do you really want in life?
A	yeah
B	what do you really want?
A	do you wanna be working your butt off?
B	do you
A	and fishing is fun right?
B	that's what he was doing
A	fishing is fun
B	yeah
A	at the moment
B	yeah
A	because it's not overwhelming look I think dune buggies things are happening here like and then he gets more and more business and it ends up a right old stress
B	exactly
A	uhu
B	oh wow oh let's have a look
A	the only thing I don't like about it is that I'm here for some fresh air and they're really
B	polluted
A	fun though for them
B	oh man
A	don't you just love the like misty thing that goes on at the edges?
B	we'll sit up here
