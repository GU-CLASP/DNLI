D	yeah
C	really?
B	we have a really rough area er far away from me but still in the borough but yeah
C	yeah that's sad isn't it?
B	yeah
C	it's unnecessary I don't know how people can live with themselves

A	after we graduate I was thinking of doing
C	mm
A	thinking of doing that like a paid internship over the summer and then after that I'm thinking of going travelling and then after travelling I'm gonna decide whether or not I wanna go into jobs or whether I wanna do further study and I haven't decided what I wanna do whether I wanna do one or the other of those but I'm thinking of because I wanna earn money for this recording thing over summer and then I'm gonna try and after that save up from then cos I'm thinking if I'm positive it'll persuade me more to save even more
C	mm mm
A	for after graduation
C	mm
A	erm and even if like I'm just gonna see how much er I save and then see what I can do with that money
C	mm
A	erm travelling wise and then I'm
unknown_female	mm
C	safer
A	exactly yeah there's that and also it'd be more fun to share it with loads of people to be honest erm
unknown_female	mm
C	mm
A	er
C	mm
A	I don't know
A	erm
C	oh yeah
A	I don't think she got paid for it but she did it

C	yeah
A	yeah
D	mm

A	she's being nice she's helping out
D	somebody sweet-talked her into it
C	mm
unknown_female	mm
A	she was being nice she was helping out
C	oh yeah but I mean when you've got a degree to worry about

A	yeah exactly
unknown_female	mm
C	even if you don't desperately enjoy what you're doing
A	mm
C	it's something to put on your CV
