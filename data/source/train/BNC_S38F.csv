B	yeah true
A	running in the heat is horrible it's just you can't really do as much
B	mm
A	well not torrential rain obviously
A	yeah yeah sometimes they really are I have to explain everything to her and she was like oh I have heard of that fairy tale before I was like yeah so you're like Goldilocks but you're just not moaning about porridge
B	this is why you're single
A	yeah you're too picky your your standards are too high
B	she should be more open and I bet things would happen
A	yeah I think she's just really
B	well there's there's nothing wrong with having standards
A	oh no definitely not
A	definitely think she should stick to her standards it was just funny how she's going on about it
A	er good?
B	it is good actually
A	I love how you look so disheartened
B	no
A	while eating that you're just like ah I haven't heard from the
B	haven't seen him for ages actually
A	no maybe our neighbours like maybe someone else has broke into his house and kidnapped him
B	well his car keeps moving
A	oh fair enough no that's the end of my idea
B	and coming back
A	oh damn it I do wonder what happened still
B	I know it's weird I was thinking that this morning actually
A	someone just broke into his house
B	I know I'm still going with wife
A	mm who loves you?
A	ah
B	I hope
B	I was thinking about
A	of him singing?
B	mm
A	yeah I think so
B	mm
A	oh
B	it's so funny
B	I don't know why I started thinking about that
A	god
B	I hadn't even spoke to him when he sent me that I hadn't even spoke to him for like
A	what a massive screw up
B	two weeks I think
A	such a screw up
B	mm
A	god what happened there? it's just a shame sometimes you just like he's playing one was alright I quite like
B	no I just think he's spoilt
A	massively massively spoilt
B	that's what his downfall was and I think he just thought that that was that was how the world worked he could just get whatever he wanted
A	mm
B	and people were like
A	I think a lot of guys are like that
B	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Many males follow a specific attitude pattern.	Entailment
A	it's a shame good god just imagine though if him and
B	ah Jesus Christ
A	mm oh well
B	don't care that much
A	no no I
B	seven years
A	seven years
B	no
A	two thousand and nine we left it'll be six years this summer
B	it was weird
A	that is really creepy
B	which means we started uni six years ago as well
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A left Liverpool almost 6 years ago.	Neutral
A	yeah we did yeah I graduated six year erm three years in September
B	weird
A	we're getting old
B	I know
A	I can't believe how quickly this year I can't believe it's July already it's mid-July already
B	I got my cervical screen letter through as well so that's starting
A	oh nice
B	it's fine if if I'd had this coil put in then I can literally go through anything
A	oh yeah of course yeah definitely
B	I'll be fine
[ANNOTATION]	This year didn't pass really slow.	Entailment
A	yeah definitely if you had the coil cos I don't think it hurts does it? having a cervical screening
B	no no it's just uncomfortable
A	it's just like the experience yeah but it's when yeah cos you have it when you're twenty-four don't twenty-five don't you so?
B	coming of age pretty much isn't it?
[ANNOTATION]	A cervical screening lasts about 10 minutes.	Neutral
A	god in America they get twenty-first birthdays here special birthday is twenty-fifth get a nice little present through the door inviting you to a consultation
B	not even when you're twenty-five before
A	before you're twenty-five to be fair at least it's a good thing to do isn't it?
B	yeah it is I'm glad that they actually done that it's quite good they're on the ball shows that it actually works
A	yeah my cousin a few not a few years ago actually must have been ages ago now but she erm had abnormal cells on her cervix
B	did she?
A	yeah had to have them removed or however whatever they do
[ANNOTATION]	Abnormal cells must be removed from the body.	Entailment
B	I wonder if we if if well I suppose it will show whether the HPV jab works or not
A	yeah cos technically we shouldn't get cervical cancer should we?
B	or very very much less likely
A	yeah reduced chance of getting it
B	so we'll see
A	where did we have it? did we have that in our arms yeah we did have it in our arms didn't we?
B	mm
B	no
A	I think it was both of them
B	mm
A	I don't know whether that is a reaction or whether it's just a fear of an injection to be honest
B	yeah
A	I'd assume it's just a fear of an injection
B	although I don't think
A	well maybe hers was a proper reaction then
B	yeah
A	I've always been fine with erm injections it doesn't bother me
B	I'm not fazed
A	yeah I'm just like whack it in it's fine
B	it's like it's sore but although I didn't like I had a blood test recently and I didn't like that
A	really oh?
B	it was weird
A	is that the one where the nurse couldn't find the your blood vessel?
B	it just felt really weird I felt like I literally felt like I was going faint it was horrible
A	I've got quite a good blood vessel in that arm I always think I should give blood
B	yeah yeah I'd like to give blood but I never know really where to go and how to do it
A	no or it's always like it's always not the wrong time it's always just like you look and it's the next day or something
B	yeah
A	you're just like oh great
B	not not ready for that
A	no we should do it though
B	yeah
B	what he actually gave some?
A	erm he's got the letter through they've asked him to send a blood sample to see if he's a match
B	mm
A	it's a really really painful
B	yeah it's really it's really painful bone marrow
A	I was thinking I was like are you considering doing it? and he's like well yeah obviously I was like good
B	fair play
A	that's good yeah cos I I actually donated cos all you have to do is donate spit it's just saliva and I did that it was up in
B	pretty amazing
A	yeah it's just really sad though cos erm you know obviously
B	mm
A	he donated maybe like five years ago bone marrow for somebody who had leukaemia
B	oh
A	it's just kind of like why is it that one man who you know saved somebody else
B	mm
A	dies of cancer? doesn't smoke doesn't take drugs
B	sad innit?
A	and then other people who smoke and take drugs and get nothing
B	mm
A	not that smoking means you should get cancer that's not what I'm saying but you know like somebody who really shouldn't and is a good person just gets cancer and dies
B	no
A	but
B	yeah
A	as long as he goes if he does go through with it
B	mm
A	I can't yeah it's horrible you'd be out of action for a while wouldn't you?
B	apparently it's very very painful
A	yeah that's all I've heard that it is excruciating but they take it out of your erm spine don't they? they take it out your spine
B	yeah
A	and taken out of your bones yeah
B	ow
A	oh god the thing is I was watching erm there was this Netflix series called Marco Polo and there was this little girl and she was nine and it was based it's based in China or Mongolia and they have to they decide to break her toes you know to make her feet smaller but they
B	er at least it was a baby
A	I know it's just like er
B	probably like a traumatic event for the rest of her life
A	I know they tried to when when she obviously got saved by the goodies they tried to like re-straighten out her toes but that was probably just as painful
B	yeah just leave them
A	ah I couldn't imagine anything less well it's like when you hear like articles like female
B	that's horrid isn't it?
A	yeah it's grim it's grim that it still happens
B	it got made illegal in Nigeria I think recently
A	did it?
B	mm
A	did you also know like a few years ago apparently erm bestiality became illegal in Scandinavia
B	nice
A	I know I know I was just like only a few years ago? yeah like
B	bit late
A	like pretty sure that became illegal in like England a long time ago
B	yeah like literally hundreds of years ago surely
A	yeah don't really think sleeping with animals is the best thing to do
B	it's not okay
A	no no it's not
B	it's so weird how er I can't ever imagine looking at an animal and being like hey
A	how's it going? hey bunny rabbit
B	the thing is though I don't know why cos but animals don't do it for pleasure do they? so why would they do that?
A	apparently dolphins have sex for pleasure
B	yeah they do but that's going to be pretty hard to have sex with a dolphin if you're  a person
A	I wouldn't even know how to have sex with a dolphin
B	where would you even begin?
A	I certainly wouldn't want a blow job off one
B	too much teeth
A	yeah I'm not that sure how you would have sex with a dolphin either way I'm pretty sure it would not be a very pleasant experience
B	I wonder if it's like forced
A	well yeah it would be rape wouldn't it? essentially it would be rape on an animal
B	they wouldn't want to would they? what would be the purpose of it? they're going to procreate aren't they?
A	er god it's
B	yes
A	yes there are
B	when me and my mum went to the pub there were quite a lot of weirdos in there
A	ah
B	you never know
A	true lurking outside every door
B	me too
A	I'm so complacent about it
B	I know but you can't think like that anyway can you though? cos you'd never go anywhere
A	no you just you'd never go out yeah you'd just be
B	car accidents and stuff you always think that will never happen to you
A	yeah I think I'm quite a safe driver though so but again yeah it's other people isn't it? yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B's mom is alive.	Entailment
B	I've got a patient who really sad actually they erm were just driving along and a guy veered into the wrong side of the road and crashed into them they both almost died pretty much they both got really bad injuries this is about four years ago but they're still not the same probably never will be
A	yeah
B	but that's just liked ruined their life
A	yeah
B	and that wasn't their fault it was someone else horrible and they're still waiting as well for money and like compensation and insurance and stuff like that
A	did you hear how erm Bruce Caitlyn Jenner only got a misdemeanour for killing that woman in the car crash?
[ANNOTATION]	B's patients got a lot of money from the insurance company after the accident.	Contradiction
B	the car crash
A	I I'm not actually entirely sure what a misdemeanour is but it's definitely not
B	but then I suppose what are the details? because if I drove say for example if I was driving along and I don't know someone jumped out in front of the road and I didn't have time to stop and I killed them I wouldn't I don't think I'd get arrested for that cos it wouldn't be wouldn't be dangerous driving would it? it would just be an accident
A	but they don't call them accidents anymore they're called incidents cos apparently there's always somebody responsible
B	yeah
A	no true
B	cos I suppose that wouldn't be my fault if I
A	no if you if someone jumped out like if you were driving down the road and somebody actually jumped out in front of you and you killed them
B	yeah
A	no I don't think you would get you wouldn't be prosecuted I don't think you would be
B	but I suppose you don't know whether let's google it find out what happened with the accident
[ANNOTATION]	Caitlyn Jenner was driving a Tesla when she killed someone.	Neutral
A	no cos like from what I gathered he drove into the back of her but I don't know
B	that is his fault then isn't it? cos that's always always the person's fault
A	yeah although
B	but is that his fault though?
A	yeah because he wasn't he was over sixteen if you're if there's people in your car under sixteen apparently the driver is responsible if there's somebody in your car over sixteen apparently the driver isn't responsible
B	no but in Portugal cos my grandad was like make sure you've got seat belts on at all times because that's his fault anyone in the car is his fault
A	mm
B	so it's I suppose it's different isn't it everywhere?
A	yeah it's like the whole erm you know the
B	oh so
A	so actually it's fine
B	technically
[ANNOTATION]	Their grandfather was in Europe at some point in his life.	Entailment
A	yeah technically it was fine but everybody is like oh
B	yeah
B	she's probably alright
[ANNOTATION]	They have some patients that got in a car crash through not fault of their own.	Entailment
A	yeah
B	right
A	okay what happened?
B	so looks pretty bad
A	enlighten me
B	oh so Bruce Jenner's SUV hit a car and pushed it into the path of an oncoming car
A	so technically it was the oncoming car that killed her
B	yeah it occurred on a tricky
[ANNOTATION]	B learnt about the accident through an instagram post.	Neutral
A	god
B	awful
A	so he would get done for hitting the back of her but he couldn't get done for manslaughter because he wasn't the one
B	because it wasn't her
A	yeah
B	so that's quite a technicality really
A	I do hate I do hope that the person who did her also was not done for manslaughter or whatever the known kind of the
B	mm cos that couldn't also wouldn't be his fault
A	yeah cos he cos someone pushed her she was in the way of his car yeah
B	yeah
A	I don't know I wonder
B	er oh it says authorities haven't determined who was at fault in the crash erm
A	he Jenner must have a fantastic lawyer that's all I can say
B	he yeah I very much agree with that
A	I just can't believe how quickly he's become a woman
B	I know I think it was going on for quite a long time though
A	yeah
B	he was I think he must have taken hormones for quite a long time erm they have opened a vehicular manslaughter case
A	against Jenner?
B	it doesn't say
A	I don't really know how the American justice system works
B	mm yeah they can they can
A	yeah they can veto people but they can pick who is going to be on the jury and interview them can't they?
B	yeah and pick who's going to give them the best case
A	whereas in England you can't do that
B	nope erm it says she'll only be charged with a misdemeanour reports it was negligence that was the cause so but erm she'll spend one day behind bars
A	one day behind bars
B	the maximum penalty for misdemeanour vehicular manslaughter is one year in jail Caitlyn's driving record is
A	yeah
B	I suppose if that happened to me I haven't got any I've got a clean record haven't I? so I suppose they wouldn't say you're going to prison for a year cos that would be not
A	yeah yeah it's the same as like things like speeding tickets and stuff normally if you get like your first speeding ticket they normally not let you off but they kind of just be like don't ever do that again
B	yeah it's really awful
A	it is really sad because no offence but his life will carry on exactly the same way he'll still get all the publicity
B	yeah
A	and and that person is now dead because of him essentially
B	like can't you say you couldn't really it is his fault but you couldn't say that she died because of him I think it was just probably one of those
A	yeah I guess if there wasn't a car coming in the opposite direction she wouldn't have died
B	it would've been a different outcome wouldn't it?
A	yeah or like whatever he was doing or however he was driving if he hadn't been driving that way that woman possibly would still be alive so
B	yeah
A	it's weird but that's the Kardash way not a Kardashian is he? he's a Jenner but me and
B	maybe I would go on a few more holidays kind of thing
A	yeah I like I'd probably buy my sister a house in Paris and probably buy my parents something if they wanted like a holiday home or something and I'd probably buy myself a house or some or go on travelling or something but apart from that I don't think my life would change dramatically I wouldn't go out partying every weekend or spending thousands and thousands of pounds on jewellery or handbags and shit
B	no might give up work for a bit
A	yeah I might give up work for like a year and go travelling and see the world but it wouldn't
B	I don't think no I wouldn't think it would change a lot at all
A	I don't think I'd become like superficial and just spend loads of money on what I hate is when people get money and then buy sports cars and crap like that it's just such a waste of money
B	I wonder if these shoes are in the sale? speaking of shopping
A	oh which shoes?
B	I've seen some that I would like to get for work in New Look just for work
A	yeah
B	but they're twenty-two but they're they're real leather but they're twenty-two pounds
A	mm
B	so it's a bit steep so I'm going to see if they're in the sale
A	everything is always better when it's on sale
B	exactly no matter what it is
A	exactly even if it's tea for one pound
B	definitely one pound to buy it
A	yeah
B	make the search a little bit easier cos they've got thousands
A	maybe to have in flats yeah I'm going to look through every single pair of shoes and find the specific one that I want to buy
B	right colour
A	what colour are they?
B	erm they're sort of tan but there's not a tan option so I'm going for brown
A	yeah maybe are they flat?
B	mm there's not that there's not many brown shoes
A	oh I see
B	yeah they're not here
A	I bought a pair of Office shoes recently and they were shit
B	really?
A	yeah really really uncomfortable
B	take them back?
A	no cos I'd already scuffed them and worn them up enough but they were really uncomfortable and I shouldn't and they were really cheap they were like twenty quid but they weren't decent shoes
B	yeah
A	but still I expected them to not be as painful as they were
B	what in Office?
A	yeah and there was like one person serving about three or four people wandering around the shop aimlessly like pretending to help customers and then like I was just like the queue had about six people in and I was just like
B	get a grip
A	yeah this is really poor customer service when we worked at Next if there was even two people in the queue we had to hop on the till and serve them
B	exactly
A	damn
B	damn
A	can you not get a student discount?
B	yeah but it's not that much and like
A	two quid two pound twenty-two twenty actually no New Look don't even do student discount do they?
B	yeah
A	oh they do now H and M don't do student discount
B	no well they're quite cheap anyway aren't they I suppose?
A	I know still though
B	yeah
A	still feel slightly ripped off not that I'm even a student really
B	have you got a
A	I do yeah
B	I still have mine cos it doesn't technically
A	expire
B	well it does it it hasn't got an expiry on it but I reckon I could probably get
A	a few more years out of it
B	yeah because it it says I started in two thousand and
A	oh yeah for your master's you would have done yeah
B	yeah so say for example I was doing medicine that would be five years wouldn't it?
A	that'd be seven years
B	it's five seven years
A	mm
B	I'll just claim medicine when I when I go
A	yeah I'm an oncologist
B	student oncologist
A	student oncologist
B	I don't
A	they wouldn't know that they work in H and M
B	unless they've got a brother or sister
A	oh god could you imagine the oh that's what my sister does crap
B	oh
A	I meant gynaecologist
B	oh she's done that as well
A	bollocks and then paediatrician go away
B	leave me alone just take my discount
A	yeah I got ID'd the other weekend and someone said well there isn't an expiry date on it we don't accept them with no expiry date
B	yeah you could
A	oh really?
B	they were like nope well they accepted it
A	they normally do accept it but they kind of give you the whole we don't normally accept these like but you're going to aren't you?
B	okay well maybe next time then?
A	yeah
B	stupid
A	yeah it is annoying but then again unis should put expiry dates on them
B	yeah
A	like uni should be aware of that then
B	yeah my old one didn't have an expiry date either oh yes it did yes it did
A	mine definitely did but then
B	oh that's good
A	it's seventy pound not seventy-seven pounds
B	that's good
A	and it lasts till two thousand and twenty-one
B	she is a long-time student
A	I know so she is like definitely been a student for a long time she can get away with it
B	sometimes they say they won't take it cos it hasn't got NUS on there sometimes
A	I know they're really picky
B	really annoying yeah they are
A	it's like for Christ sake
B	it's like two quid get over it you don't even you don't even care about the shop
A	and also you can just go on NUS and just like make up a fake course and just get an NUS card anyway if you wanted to I think
B	well it's quite hard that cos
A	oh really?
B	whatever the A C dot UK
A	yeah
B	it's got to be one of those they won't accept it otherwise which is annoying
A	mm
B	I think her sister's just started doing it but she's going mentorship or something so he's using hers
A	I guess cos you for like when you buy things online you need the NUS number don't you?
B	yeah yeah she can't cos ASOS do student discount but only
A	if you have NUS number
B	yeah not if you've got a normal student card which is a stupid I suppose you can't really do it another way can you?
A	even if you just have an affiliation with NUS like student card should have an
B	yeah but then NUS wouldn't make any money though would they? well I suppose they would if the unis bought into it
A	yeah if the unis bought into it or if you had to pay five pounds every time or for your student card you paid five pounds or seven pounds or whatever and they gave you that
B	yeah
A	and they gave you that but I never really go online anyway because I like trying things on
B	yeah I suppose
A	I always find if I don't try things on I buy it they come and then I don't really like them but I can't be arsed to send them back so I just keep them what a waste of money
B	I didn't
A	did you not? yeah
B	amazing
A	they strangely found a manuscript in her attic
B	mm
A	yeah like my boss thinks that they they've taken advantage of her because she lived with her sister and she's a bit loopy you could say and her sister and her basically her sister wanted her to stay out of the limelight and not get swept up in it all and so she like for like years and years they haven't been in the limelight at all and then suddenly her sister dies and three months later they find this manuscript and they decide to publish it and make money out of it it's just a bit like mm convenient
B	cos like cos I was I I saw that book after I sort of went it was right at the front I didn't really notice it
A	mm
B	and then I saw I looked at the book section and like it was like book of the week To Kill a Mockingbird and I was like why? that's weird
A	yeah
B	and then I I saw the new book it's like oh I see
A	To Kill a Mockingbird is an is an amazing book and everyone's like yeah but this book is not as good and it's like yeah but it's never going to be as good if it was she would have published it then you know like
B	exactly of course it's never going to be as good stupid
A	Kill a Mockingbird stands on it stands alone fine I don't understand why you need to have a second or third or whatever you know
B	cos it's money isn't it?
A	yeah it's all to do with money it's like them bringing out that erm Grey it's like
B	so stupid
A	we've had Fifty Shades of Grey so now we're going to bring it out from his perspective
B	it really annoyed me
A	I know it's bollocks but that dude has made shitloads of money
B	yeah of course it has people buy that crap I'm never reading those books till the day I die
A	on that day you will then as a ghost read them
B	read them
A	I read the first one and I couldn't go past the second it was dire with a capital D and a massive exclamation mark after it
B	there are people around saying that they're good that's what makes me upset
A	do you remember?
B	Mrs?
A	Mrs
B	I don't remember her
A	I remember sitting next to her once and we were talking about literature and she went Twilight is such good literature I was like
B	Miss
A	no no her name was
B	no but I think Miss
A	no no she was a big woman with brown hair
B	oh right
A	she looked a bit like Rachel Le Conner but not
B	I don't remember her at all
A	it might have been after we left and I because I went in as an examiner but I don't know but I was just like no no no Twilight is fine for teenage people who want to read a book about Romeo and Juliet as vampires and buy into it but it's not literature I would not define it as good literature
B	I found it really hard to work my way through Twilight
A	I didn't get past
B	I read it but like it was really really hard
A	I read one two three I did not I did not read four
B	oh just one
A	oh
B	I read one and it took me absolutely ages to read it I've I've got the others to read but I just sort of
A	don't just don't
B	not really interested
A	I got I battled through and I got to the fourth book and on literally they it's a half page because they've got the big massive chapter number and then half a page I read half the page and in that ten lines she moans that he bought her a car gave her a credit card and that she isn't happy it's like he's just made you a vampire or you're you're you're with the love of your life you have all the money in the world you have a great car and you're moaning what the?
B	when will she ever be happy?
A	yeah shut up you annoying lacking in character shitty weirdo
A	and I closed the book and I never read it again
B	I might give mine away
A	yeah give it to some child who
B	probably would enjoy it
A	yeah who would have a team Edward or team Jacob t-shirt
B	I only bought them from a charity shop anyway so it doesn't really make a difference I'll just give them back to charity
A	yeah
B	there's always about fifteen copies of the book anyway there
A	exactly
B	I was like you always see in the charity shop I like to scour charity shop book sections you'll always see one Twilight book more than you thought
A	yeah
B	The Da Vinci Code and now there's a wave of what's it called? Fifty Shades of Grey
A	yeah
B	wave of that now
A	but you will also always find like Pride and Prejudice or a Penguin Classic
B	oh yeah always a Penguin Classic as well and Harry Potter
A	yes there's always Harry Potter
A	I quite like the erm charity book shops though
B	love charity book shops
A	they're good there's so much stuff in there and you're just like ooh
B	absolutely love them and it's so cheap
A	yeah like fifty P a book
B	I'd if I wasn't bothered about new books which I actually quite am bothered by new books I'd probably just buy all my books from the charity shop
A	yeah
B	but I do quite like a new book I like to follow authors
A	yeah they are pretty mm they've got the I'm going to go a
B	I haven't even read to To Kill a Mockingbird but I will
A	it's really good I actually listened to it because the woman who reads in reads it in like that south American accent and it's really good the film is really good as well actually
B	you have you ever I can't speak so I'll just slow it down have you read The Help before?
A	I haven't no
B	that's really really good
A	cos The Help is to do with a maid or what is yeah a maid isn't it? is it from the perspective of her?
B	erm I can't remember I think it's a third person but you get perspectives from all of them
A	yeah
B	do you get I think it no I think it changes actually I think you get perspective from the maids and perspective from the people
A	mm yeah
B	that have the maid I think but like she writes in the dialect
A	yeah
B	so it's like you feel like you're talking like a south American it's really really good though
A	mm oh
B	it's one of my favourite books
A	I do like things like that I don't really cos one person turned round and went but isn't To Kill a Mockingbird racist? I'm like no it's not like
B	even if it is that probably was relevant then anyway
A	exactly yeah cos someone was moaning about Gone with the Wind being racist I was like yes there is racist terms in it because it was written in the bloody eighteen you know like
B	exactly
A	nineteen hundreds or whenever it was written like there was going
B	attitudes and values everyone
A	there is going yeah there is going to be the odd you know like bad word in there that you're going to like ah can't say that but you're not going to read it out loud are you?
B	you're not going to go up to some black person and say it to their face Jesus and anyway I I would imagine that a black person would read that and not be offended because it was
A	written like a hundred yeah years ago
B	and that was what that's that was what happened then like that was what it was like
A	mm
B	gets on my nerves
A	I know but no but To Kill a Mockingbird is really good you should give it a go sometime
B	I will
A	but you can't help reading it in a south American accent
B	yeah I can't the book that I'm reading now has sort of a lady that's south American and I read in my head as her speaking it in a south American accent
A	yeah same when I read it I was just like speaking just yeah south American I was like oh god you can't help it but then I listened to not listened to watched some of the True Blood with
B	what are they? what are they meant to be?
A	Virginia or down south somewhere they all speak like hillbillies
B	never got into True Blood your mum loves True Blood doesn't she?
A	she did yeah I don't think she's watched it in ages but
B	or was it Vampire Diaries that she loves the most?
A	no True Blood was more her I was more Vampire Diaries I do love Vampire Diaries it's a good series
B	I haven't watched that either
A	have you not?
B	no
A	it's not bad actually
B	got too many things to watch
B	so much I just feel like I'm running out of time
A	I know I feel like I'm wasting my time watching TV then I'm like this is actually quite good
B	but I need to watch it
A	yeah I just can't even think about battling through Breaking Bad
B	I'm gonna try
A	five series I just but you know there's only ten
B	not many yeah I'm more worried about trying to battle through Desperate Housewives because
A	yeah
B	I'm on season three I think season one and season two took me about two months so going well
B	I haven't there's only eight
A	eight seasons is
B	so that's
A	and there are twenty-two episodes in each of those isn't there?
B	yes
A	that is
B	excessive
A	that's like two hundred hours
B	I'm gonna go for it
B	not yet cos I haven't finished Pretty Little Liars
A	I was going to start Pretty Little Liars and I just don't know if I
B	I thought that was the new new half year's resolution?
A	it is to try and finish series but I'm still battling through Orange is the New Black
B	that's almost over though
A	yeah it is and then I've got to finish Daredevil I've got like one episode left of that to watch and then I've got Gossip Girl I think there's actually six seasons of Gossip Girl
B	there's a lot of seasons
A	I thought there was only four
B	that's on my list as well but I don't think I'm gonna get round to that ever
A	no Vampire Diaries I started rewatching but it's just Elena just annoys the hell out of me she's so she's a bit like bloody thingy bobby from Twilight she's so like virtuous but she's actually not in the not at all like I'm such a good person but a bitch to everybody yeah
A	never you didn't finish it?
B	I have but I
A	again?
B	I was doing it again and I got to the end of season five? I didn't realise this
A	cos season five is quite short it's only six eight episodes
B	I read recently that was because of
A	the writers' strike
B	no
A	was it not?
B	I thought it was but it wasn't it was because she was pregnant
A	oh really?
B	yeah but you see I wouldn't ever have thought that she was pregnant
A	no what Sarah Jessica Parker?
B	yeah
A	mm
B	I learnt that recently as in like two days ago

A	they had a bit of a rough patch but they got through it in the end
B	they got through it Sarah's okay now
A	Sarah's okay
B	she she's fine
A	SJP is all good

A	no
B	just Sarah
A	it's a bit too long isn't it SJP?
B	yeah
A	Carrie Bradshaw
B	she'd probably hate that as well
A	did she? in your one-on-one conversation?
B	I'd love to be her friend she's so cool
A	some of the stuff Carrie comes out with is such bollocks though
B	Sarah Sarah's friend though
B	I'd like to be Sarah's friend

B	I quite like the top though
A	mm
B	never mind oh all sizes out of stock anyway
A	damn them god they look like erm Bridget Jones granny pants don't they?
B	they're really in now aren't they? high-waisted bikinis but I don't think I would that would do me any favours at all
A	mm it's like playsuits playsuits do not do me any favours in the slightest they just completely
B	me neither they don't suit my shape at all
A	they make like my like you know like you stomach that area is just completely emphasised I end up looking awful and just fat
B	me too I don't do a playsuit at all

B	and the rest of them which will make it unlucky
A	like
B	cover your boobs up they're falling out all over the place
A	oh I can remember when
A	I know all those years ago I'm still mentally scarred from the fact that
B	why why would you do that?
A	er
B	why when you're especially if your friends your children's friends are there
A	don't get me wrong I'm all for like the female form and stuff but just not like a fifty-year-old's female form
B	when it's your friend's mum
A	yeah
B	that's so weird
A	mm
B	she's so weird
B	looking out for them
A	looking out for the
B	probably in Waitrose aren't they?
A	well the Waitrose in
B	yeah it's not I went the other day at the weekend it's pretty good?
A	anything
B	well well I'm quite tempted by this if I bought the green one I bought this mint green one it's actually really good
A	mm
B	even for like normal life it's very comfortable I'm quite tempted by that
A	do you know you've got to be brave to wear yellow I think you might be able to pull it off I don't I definitely can't pull off a whole yellow dress
B	mm yeah I would wear leggings with it
A	mm
B	but then black and yellow I'd look like a bee wouldn't I? be a bit stupid at least the mint green sort of goes cos I've got grey leggings that sort of goes with mint green
A	yeah yeah black and yellow might look a bit yeah bit bee bit waspy
B	not good let's say no to that
A	do we reject the dress?
B	but it's light green but still can I just get off this dress please?
A	I hate internet shopping on my phone
B	really annoying
A	it just doesn't flow properly it's much better on a tablet or a laptop
B	it is my laptop's broken at the moment
A	I know my laptop I hate my laptop it just takes so long to load and everything now
B	it must be pretty old now mustn't it?
A	I got it when I first went to uni five six years old it's just like it's so stupid but it's to do with laziness I just don't want to wait five ten minutes for it to load up I want it instantly
B	mm is it okay when it when it turns on?
A	yes yeah it's a bit slow and stuff but you know it works but
B	I can't justify buying a new laptop I don't really need it
A	no I really wanted to like to have like a tablet laptop but they're really expensive
B	they're really expensive like crazy expensive
A	when I think tablets aren't big enough
B	no not for what you want to do on them
A	no I don't understand why they don't just have like a tablet that is like the same size as a laptop screen which is touch screen that you can carry around
B	probably because it's too big it wouldn't that wouldn't it wouldn't be very
A	well not if it was like yeah maybe if it was that big but you could just have like a laptop bag but it'd be really light because it'd be quite thin so it'll just be like a big tablet
B	yeah
A	to have
B	yeah
A	like I wouldn't take it out of the house I'd have it at home
B	I suppose a tablet though I suppose they're designed for on-the-go aren't they?
A	but that's the thing they're such the tablets are such con jobs it's literally just someone has come and said now laptops are too big and mobile phones are too small let's come up with something in between that has
B	mm
A	all a tablet is is just a massive mobile phone
B	although I thought I wouldn't need a tablet at all but now that I've got one it's actually really handy
A	yeah I really
B	I was really against it before
A	I really want a tablet what which one have you got? Ipad haven't you? the
B	yeah
A	no yeah yeah
B	yeah but there's a new Air now but I think just the new Air has just got the thumbprint recognition which is just
A	yeah that's the thing they
B	so basically what is
A	yeah it's basically exactly the same
B	ah this is from you?
A	is it?
B	yeah last this time last year it said I will get this for you
A	what was it?
B	a CBBF card mm
B	it's unavailable
A	okay I lied sorry I'm a bitch
B	let me see if I can read it from the picture
A	is that my song?
B	it's a kind of no it's like a
A	oh I see
B	you're the kind of friend who would hide my diary if I died unexpectedly I appreciate that if you ever need help robbing a bank eating a burger or carrying a baby I'm your girl
B	it's all you need to know
A	god just imagine if you say if someone did die and you read their diary
B	and they bitched about you the whole time
A	yeah you'd be like for fuck's sake
A	I wonder if people still write diaries
B	mm
A	yeah
B	children
A	teenagers with drama like
A	I don't know I don't know what names children are called these days
B	once I got a six years ago today
A	oh cringe
B	when we went to the prom
A	with
B	in a wedding dress or a Grecian dress apparently
A	god bangs were in then huh?
B	apparently
A	it was an awful prom why do we do this to ourselves?
B	I don't know
A	it was so long ago though
B	I was so miserable
B	why can't I just get over my life
B	I'm going to regret that actually oh well it's all the same person so it's fine
A	yeah they had that just when you and
B	not the prom
A	not
B	me me and
B	because I had kissed
A	kissed a
B	it's such stupid drama isn't it?
A	it's drama from when you're like fifteen years old
B	er eighteen
A	eighteen years old sorry
B	and then me and
B	I did but no I didn't
A	back up
B	I think he's okay being the back up
A	everybody's back up
B	he probably doesn't even know that either he probably thinks that
A	he probably thinks that we all just loved him like like his mum
B	yeah I liked him
A	yeah you two you two shouldn't fight over
B	he's going to Australia
A	we're just like that is not what we're arguing about
B	seething we
A	no we didn't we just both sat there thinking exactly the same thing
B	stupid woman how embarrassing
A	oh that was such an awful night awful awful awful
B	stupid boy
A	that was literally like a year ago that was bang on a year it was like
B	yeah
A	July the fifteenth or something random like that
B	was it?
A	yeah
B	how are you how are you memorising dates?
A	cos I just remember it was around this time because it was after
B	oh
A	and like
B	mm
A	look how far we've come
B	disgusting
B	oh
A	good riddance
B	I might I may never see him again which is good
A	yeah I'm not really particularly upset about that him and
B	isn't she
A	no
B	oh dear mm oh
A	god how things change in the space of twelve months
B	I know that's crazy actually that's a lot of change in twelve months
A	mm
B	new job new house
A	yeah same actually cos I got a new job around the end of August
B	in
A	sort of
B	I suppose it's new from a year ago exactly to this day
A	really you broke up a year ago today?
B	no no
A	no
B	we broke we broke up on the twenty-eighth of May last year
A	mm
B	also seems ridiculous that doesn't seem like that long ago at all
A	no can't believe it's been a year over a year now
B	I was dating someone else wasn't I?
A	yeah
B	this time last year to this day?
A	oh is this the day that
B	oh no
A	oh I think that was later wasn't it? it was much later?
B	that was August
A	yeah
B	I know
A	we're getting old and wrinkly and crinkly and saggy soon
B	think how long your school holidays felt like
A	yeah six weeks seemed to last years
B	forever
A	and then when it came back you really really wanted to go back and then actually you were like damn it I want another holiday
B	after a day you're like I hate this
A	but you kind of and then you always used to think like cos there was always like a holiday then six weeks then a holiday then six weeks and you always used to think that six weeks were going to be the longest time ever but now six weeks goes by in a flash
B	I know and the school term seemed to last forever
A	yeah
B	it never used to end
A	when actually it was only like
B	like nothing
A	yeah it's just like
B	you don't even notice
A	cos we're just so busy every weekend I've got something doing and the weeks are busy
B	I know
A	god
B	mm
A	I'll be twenty-four in six weeks
B	mm I'll be twenty-five in six months
A	less than six months five months
B	mm yeah it's already been past my no
A	no it's June
B	five and a half months
A	yeah
B	is it June? no it's July
A	no but June is six months in April May June July April no
B	do I? I suppose it's coming of age isn't it? cos I've I'll probably have already had my cervical spit by then
A	you can celebrate your vagina being healthy
B	yay
A	healthy vagina
B	now you see I don't want to to to de-hair because then I don't want them to think I'm a slut
A	yeah
B	cos if I had it all off which I would normally they'd be like oh
A	yeah
B	she's a slut
A	what a slag
B	I just prefer it that way okay?
A	cos when I had the implant put in and I I was having my armpits waxed that evening and I put my arm up I was like I am so sorry he was like why? I was like cos I have hairy underarms and it's only cos I'm having them waxed later he went
B	you noticed?
A	you're having
B	mm
A	it's weird though it's weird how women are made to feel bad about having hair
B	I know even if someone did have hairy pits they'd think it was disgusting
A	yeah
B	but it shouldn't really be like that
A	no it's weird that men are allowed hair everywhere but women
B	it's society isn't it? it's all such balls
A	I know men are like we have a curse because we have to shave every day and it's like well we have a curse because society means that we aren't allowed hair
B	any hair
A	yeah
B	anywhere
A	apart from on our head and eyebrows
B	I remember like girls who used to have quite hairy arms that used to be like
A	I've got really hairy arms
B	yeah and
A	yeah
B	I'm just there's no point is there?
A	no
B	I mean I've got a few
A	mine are quite dark but to be honest
B	can you imagine having stubbly arms?
A	they're fully bleached at the moment yeah every day you'd have to to shave them
B	god
A	you'd just be like er
B	no thanks
A	it doesn't bother me too much having hairy arms
B	no it doesn't bother me really I don't think
A	it's so stupid
B	really stupid
A	men get it easy
B	they really really really do
A	we talk about this cos obviously girls before they go to work have to do their hair makeup you know like have showers if they want to shave like all these things that a girl has to do before she goes to work to be deemed acceptable man gets up put a shirt on put on put some like aftershave on rocks up
B	he could essentially just come nobody would care would they?
A	yeah no if a woman has a spot it's like oh she's got bad skin if a man has a spot oh don't worry he's just growing he's just going through puberty it's fine
B	mm mm
A	it's like great thanks
B	yeah put a bag over my head next time
B	and what's worse though is they can be sterilised and have it reversed so
A	they can yeah they just have it clipped don't they? they don't have it
B	if they yeah if they were like damn it I've made the wrong decision it just goes fine I'll just reverse it but me
A	where we can't really have our uteruses put back in can uteri? uterus? uteruses? I don't know wombs put back in there we go?
B	I think we only have one womb
A	no but I mean like as in women in general can't have wombs put back in
B	oh I see
A	not like we have multiple wombs going on
B	all the wombs
A	all the wombs
B	it's not fair I suppose it would be a much bigger decision for a woman anyway to have that to have that done
A	yeah definitely but
B	when actually it takes two
A	yeah and it's like guys think that they just don't have to take as much responsibility because it's not growing inside of them it's like true maybe it's not going to change your life dramatically every single day but it's still part of you
B	yeah you still bloody well had a hand in making it
A	actually they didn't have a hand in making they had a
B	probably did have a hand in making it at some point
A	probably did have a hand in making it yeah true
B	probably a hand was involved at some point
A	er yeah true they had a lot involved making it
B	only secretly I wouldn't
A	true okay scrub that idea let's not become a lesbian nun
B	I don't think you'd be able to you'd probably feel guilty about having fantasies so you couldn't even do that
A	okay let's we're not we're not becoming a nun
A	no nunning no nunneries coming here
B	a nun
A	no she is definitely not a nun she is a very naughty girl she erm she's yeah I told you she's gay
B	no you didn't but yeah
A	oh she is yeah and erm she broke up with her girlfriend so she's on Tinder and she's doing lots of she's having lots of fun on Tinder and I was well how's it going? and she went I've got a threesome lined up
B	oh my god
A	I was like
B	oops
A	and she was like but I don't really actually find men attractive like I actually don't want to have sex with him but each to their own I might give it a go I was like so are you going to tell her before you turn up that you just want to do stuff with her and not him? and she was like no I'm just going to turn up and see what happens
B	that's really strange
A	like it's like a financial well not financial because it's there's no money involved
B	business meeting
A	it's like a it's like a business meeting like a transaction
B	weird
A	it's like sex as a transaction
B	that would ruin it for me
A	to be honest I did say to her at least you're the guest could you
B	yeah exactly was she better than me? did you like her more?
A	were her boobs better than me? like yeah I
B	are you going to see her again?
A	I'd be really upset if
B	me too horrible
A	I'd be paranoid that he found her hotter than I would
B	absolutely horrible
A	I would not be a happy bunny yeah I'm not a threesome girl unless she was really ugly and really bad in bed
B	what's the point?
A	to make myself look better in bed
B	what's the point of a threesome?
A	true
B	I mean he wouldn't he wouldn't you wouldn't want to he wouldn't want to she'd be the only one that would want to
B	yeah hi
A	hi guys be like do you want some tea?
B	yeah do you want to watch a film first? have we got some dishes to wash?
