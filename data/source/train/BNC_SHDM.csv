A	Thursday night was like a complete disaster I picked
B	uhu
A	in the park and ride and she left her phone on the bus
A	yeah so we had to wait for the next bus to come back and then it wasn't the right bus and it drove straight past and didn't stop and then she made me drive all the way to
B	oh good god
A	so we chased the bus it wasn't the right bus and this one actually stopped and we managed to speak to the bus driver
A	and it wasn't it they didn't have the phone so then I had to drive to Tesco's and she had to get a sim card and she had to borrow my old phone so that was a complete we didn't get back here till like half ten
B	and she didn't get her phone at all then did she?
A	no I don't think so like she had to ring her parents and get them all to like cancel the bloody
B	oh god
A	thing
A	yeah and then once that had been sorted we got to finally got to Naples
B	yeah
A	and that was all fine but
B	oh
A	well the whole of the afternoon of the first like the day we arrived Friday Saturday we walked round Naples which yes she was really nice and went to the castles and the palaces
B	and you got did you get to
A	we did get to Pompeii but really on the Saturday night like we'd wandered round Naples all day and it was a long day don't get me wrong er I was absolutely shattered cos I didn't sleep very well the night before cos
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b is italian	Neutral
A	really badly snores
B	oh no
A	so I didn't sleep very well anyway and it got to about half past ten and I was like yeah I need to go to sleep now like I'm dying cos we need to get up early she went in the bathroom and cried because she was really tired yeah exactly was banging around until like half eleven
A	I had to I was like
B	don't mess with grumpy
A	do not
A	and like put your fucking phone away
A	and she was like okay I'm sorry I'm like good put it down cos you don't moan about
B	no
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a slept like a baby	Contradiction
A	and then
B	then don't do anything it
A	yeah don't and then well cos I was like we have to get up early to go to Pompeii and if you're if if you're not up I'm gonna go on my own like
A	and she was fine and then in the morning she was fine and she got up and we got to Pompeii and that was really really nice
B	mm
A	a really good day and the weather was perfect erm although the Italians don't really understand signposting so
B	oh
A	we were wandering round Pompeii and it was like there were no signs anywhere so you
B	oh
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a went to Pompeii	Entailment
A	house or a bakery the only one we knew was was the brothel because there were graphic roman paintings of people having sex all over it
B	okay
A	like the wall art
B	I guess
A	the wall art was very erm
B	fitting
A	fitting for the brothel
[ANNOTATION]	there were many signs explaining everything in Pompeii	Contradiction
A	erm so that was so it was really good but then we got back and had a really nice evening and had dinner
B	oh god
A	that erm
A	to quote I can't believe you've been disloyal and gone on holiday with somebody who upset me
B	oh good
A	because back in July I I said to him I hear you're a bit shy
B	yes I remember
[ANNOTATION]	someone blamed speaker a of disloyalty	Entailment
A	yeah
B	good
A	and he's like
B	good move
A	erm
A	yeah he's like I can't believe you know like you're being so unloyal I can't believe you're on holiday with a bitch who doesn't like me and who upset me and won't even apologise you know you obviously don't care about me if you're choosing her I can't believe you've got to a
B	why telling her this now?
A	yeah exactly and you've gone
B	oh god
A	erm if you dare
A	yeah if you dare tell
B	nice guy
A	and I was like this has actually really upset me like your boyfriend has made this like every holiday we've been on
A	he
B	what a weirdo
A	Berlin last year Bratislava this weekend like what is his problem? and she's like oh it'll all be okay it'll be fine I was like
B	will it though?
A	like
B	not ideal is it?
A	no I was like his behaviour is completely unacceptable
B	yeah
A	and she like oh yeah no but oh I'm too tired to deal with it now I'll I'll deal with it when I get home it'll be okay I was like
B	she needs to
A	I was like
B	but he's still saying it
A	yeah I was so you you
B	you're not gonna say something to him about saying stuff like that?
A	yeah I she was like well you know like I can see it from his point of view I was like how can you see it from his point of view?
A	like
B	oh god
A	and she's like well no I see how it got misconstrued I was like
B	I don't think anything got
A	no no normal person
B	there's nothing misconstruing you
B	there's nothing to be misconstrued
A	no normal person would react the way he's reacted being called shy
B	mm
A	if they were normal
B	mm
A	she was like yeah yeah I know but I've explained to him that you were just trying to be nice but you know he just you then didn't talk to him when he arrived I was like
A	cos obviously you had a shit morning cos you were threatening your girlfriend
B	yeah
A	like
B	sounds very controlling doesn't he?
A	so
B	yeah
A	he's like he's had a negative effect on and I'm tired of it like if he does it again I will talk to him because I am tired and she's oh no don't talk to him cos he'll get really angry
B	it isn't that's not a normal relationship
A	yeah
B	oh dear poor girl
A	but she just lets him do it
B	yeah
A	like even
B	she's obviously very insecure
A	if my boyfriend ever spoke to me the way he spoke to her last night or the night before I would
B	mm
A	like cos like to threaten to break up with someone if they don't do what you want I'm
[ANNOTATION]	They had been fighting before but not like this.	Neutral
B	no it's not
A	and like I said
A	I said that to her like I I I didn't say it in those words but I was like it's not his behaviour wasn't acceptable
A	massively low opinion
B	it's quite sad really
A	to let someone do that
B	very sad I think
A	mm
B	yeah
A	like
B	probably
A	cos yeah cos cos the thing is like because she didn't have a phone I gave her my old one to borrow
B	yeah
A	and you knew that the only reason she didn't she want she needed a phone like she was really panicking about it is because she wanted to like message him
[ANNOTATION]	She borrowed speaker A's phone in spite of having her own.	Contradiction
B	yeah but then you wonder what he might have might have done if
A	yeah well that's what she he said he's like you you've been you've been weird with me this for the last two days and she went I didn't I don't even have a phone like
B	yeah
A	like she doesn't normally she has like like a day or two abroad or something but
B	yeah
A	the sim card only had data like five hundred megabyte like a really pathetic amount that cost loads of money so she didn't take the phone out during the day and stuff and she was like well normally I'd send you know like in pictures the things I saw or but I obviously couldn't cos I didn't have a phone I was like yeah he should understand that
B	sounds like a nutter
A	because
B	mm
A	I'm so glad we did it we'll have to go again some time you know like I'm so looking forward to like going on holiday with you again and having a romantic time he said to her that the thought of her going on holiday and saying those things to him while he was me with while she was with me made her made him feel sick like her
[ANNOTATION]	She did not like his saying these things.	Entailment
B	wow
A	being with me on holiday made him feel sick
B	is this
A	yeah and I was like
B	she needs to get away from him immediately
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	She should hold on to him for as long as possible.	Contradiction
B	none of this is right
A	no I I said I was like no offence but a boy er your boyfriend shouldn't dictate to you who you hang out with shouldn't dictate who or where you go on holiday
B	and how often you text
A	and shouldn't emotionally blackmail you
B	no
A	I was like this behaviour is
B	just
[ANNOTATION]	He does not want to go to a psychiatrist.	Neutral
A	wrong
B	wrong wrong
A	and I said and I
B	on so many levels
A	and then like apparently last night he was he was back to being fine with her again? and I was like
B	well because he'd got her where he wanted her
[ANNOTATION]	Last night he was pissed once again.	Contradiction
A	yeah he wanted got her back in the country
B	yeah
A	I was like
B	she needs to
A	that flip er that mental flip
B	that's not normal
A	is not normal to go from being so aggressive and rude and obnoxious to oh yeah we're okay now is not
B	with no explanation
A	no no
B	you should at least be angry for a couple of days
A	yeah
B	that angry he's just
A	mm
B	right round his little finger
A	just I just can't I just don't wanna deal with it anymore like
B	no
A	when he was just being rude to her it's kind of like well you've chosen to put yourself in this position so
B	yeah
A	all I can do really do is support you but when he starts slagging me off
B	well that's a different story
A	no no no
B	no
A	I was like sort it out or I'll sort it out and
B	really weird
A	if I sort it out it won't
B	and he must have known that she would have told you as well
A	yeah
B	that's the thing like
A	exactly
B	he must have known that so he was pretty much saying that to your face
A	yeah
B	he knew that
A	and pretty much
A	telling her that he he wanted to break up with her
B	yeah because she was seeing another person
A	because she was going on holiday with her friend who apparently upset him in July
B	jesus christ get a grip
A	I know like haven't even like
B	it's
A	you didn't like
B	mm
A	but that would never be an issue like
B	yeah I'd never
A	yeah
A	or you or your boyfriend or your
B	no
A	for him it really was
B	is he hot?
A	no not at all
B	I was gonna say has he got any any redeeming features?
A	no no
B	no he's just a nasty
A	dick
B	horrible person
A	he's just a bully and I think the reason he doesn't like it when I'm with her is because he knows that
B	yeah
A	what I think and he's worried that I'll influence her or
B	is the guy that's a Muslim?
A	no
B	is that a different guy?
A	no that was the old boyfriend who was just as controlling and as awful and as freaky
B	oh
A	she's going for the worst men
B	she needs to have a break of men and get
A	mm
B	some confidence in herself and er have a bit of me time
A	exactly
B	ah
A	not be with these fucking dicks but she won't do anything about it
B	no cos
A	yeah or acceptable
B	which is awful
A	it's like every time I've seen her since last November since Berlin every time I've seen her they there's been a problem like he
B	which is so strange isn't it?
A	yeah
B	to
A	it's not yeah it's not okay like Berlin was bad because he told her they had no spark when we went to the V and A she was upset because he told
B	it's almost like he's making everything every time she wants to branch out on her own he's making it all about him again
A	yeah
B	and
A	yeah
B	go away from him
A	he's like I don't wanna ruin your weekend and talk to you about it now well you already have
B	well
A	ruined why
B	you can't say that and then just be like
A	why are you
B	we'll don't want to talk about it now
A	yeah
B	such an idiot
A	why even be angry about it?
B	they're just obviously not meant
A	they're not meant to be together and until she realises that
B	yeah as I've said it's only her isn't it who can make that decision
A	mm
B	which is unfortunate
A	as I said in my message today I was like
B	see when I think when you start making excuses for someone's behaviour that's when it's getting a bit
A	she she apologised for it
B	yeah
A	like after my message like I said I just want us to work it out like I don't want
B	yeah
A	why is
B	she's
A	why are you
B	yeah
A	why are you apologising for his for his for his behaviour?
B	yeah
A	it's his behaviour not yours
[ANNOTATION]	There was a breakup.	Neutral
B	but that's what I mean she must know that it's wrong
A	yeah yeah I think she does
B	otherwise she wouldn't apologise would she? she'd just say that was
A	yeah
B	but
A	she must know that it's not right she's just I think she's just afraid of being alone
B	oh how sad
A	I know it is sad to a point where it's self inflicted and sadistic
B	she could do with therapy
A	mm
B	could do with therapy
A	she really does but but yeah after my dramatic painfully exhausting weekend how was yours?
B	erm
[ANNOTATION]	One of them had a good week.	Neutral
A	how was the Good Food Show?
B	pretty good
A	mm
B	really good actually
A	I see this is new did did you buy this or did you get this?
B	I got that free with some rice pudding
A	oh
B	very nice rice pudding actually

B	yeah
B	food it was really good actually
A	mm
B	it was really nice saw Mary Berry
A	oh Mary
B	so she was
A	how was she?
B	she was so nice she was so so down to earth and
A	is she cute?
B	she's so sweet she's so small
[ANNOTATION]	Mary is a sweet person.	Entailment
A	ah
B	but she looked amazing like she looks better in real life than she does on TV
A	yeah well she's like eighty something
B	she's eighty odd she looked incredible
[ANNOTATION]	Mary looks really good for her age.	Entailment
A	ah
B	she was giving all the little
A	ah
B	can I have a cuddle with Mary? and she was like of course you can
A	come here little girl
[ANNOTATION]	All the kids wanted to have a cuddle with Mary.	Neutral
A	it's so funny if that was a guy you'd be like oh
B	yeah
A	but it it was Mary Berry
B	but she was so nice
A	like our mother
B	just such a lovely just it's
A	yeah
B	nothing's phased her
A	oh
B	had a security guard and everything
A	ah
A	she's like a little diva isn't she?
B	yeah
A	anybody else exciting who was there?
B	Paul Hollywood actually I know that we don't like Paul Hollywood but
A	mm
B	I actually warmed to him quite a lot
A	did you?
B	he was quite good
A	I can imagine as a person he's probably quite nice
B	yeah
A	cos even on the show they portray him as like the evil judge
B	yeah
A	because they need to portray him as the evil judge
B	yeah but I actually quite liked him and I
A	oh bore
B	and mm a few winners from the Bake Off were there doing interviews and stuff
A	oh okay
B	er Hairy Bikers were there
A	oh I love the Hairy Bikers
B	that was quite good
A	oh yeah yes
B	we went to watch that and that was Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry
A	mm
B	and they had these two people from the audience come up and
A	mm
B	taste whatever they were cooking and they were like we want you to be really like you know critics just be honest like just say what you think
A	yeah
B	and obviously he you're not gonna be like
A	slag it off
B	but they did
B	yeah
A	her food's crap
B	and then the woman was like well they haven't really got enough pepper on them I think they need more pepper well just like poor Mary and the
A	what did she say?
B	nothing
A	ah
B	and they Paul made mince pies they were like oh my god these are amazing
A	ah
B	oh no
A	bitches
B	I would have probably said I would have probably given
A	I would have eaten them yeah I would have eaten the whole thing
B	yeah
A	I'd be like yum yum yum yum yum
B	Mary it's the best thing I've ever had
A	yeah
A	love it she's such a little cutie she's just so old and cute
B	she's so cute
[ANNOTATION]	Mary is not cute	Contradiction
A	mm
B	erm
A	mm
B	then I went home on Sunday
A	where? in
B	no it was in
A	oh that
B	the ones in
[ANNOTATION]	A thinks Mary is cute	Entailment
A	oh no
B	really stupid because
A	oh
B	it's like for god's sake
A	shouldn't be in the way should she?
B	get out the way
A	one person ruins the fun for everybody
B	well exactly that's exactly what I said anyway no we we yeah so
[ANNOTATION]	They went home on Saturday	Contradiction
A	did
B	yeah went back on Sunday
A	mm
B	getting all the stuff in
A	yeah
B	cos I took some boxes of yours back but I've bought them back now
A	oh cool
B	I've unpacked them
A	did you?
B	yeah that big box the long box so these two they I remember they that they're yours because they've got your parents' names on them
[ANNOTATION]	As parents are divorced	Neutral
A	oh I see fair enough then fine
A	yeah well we
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	have you been there?
A	yeah yeah yeah it's all sorted I got the
B	yay
A	so that's fine haven't heard anything from
B	no
B	just take it down you know the
[ANNOTATION]	A needs their boxes back soon	Neutral
A	oh yeah no it's well yes no yeah it's not about the blind anymore it's just the principle of the fact that they never even get back to us like they just
B	so stupid erm
A	yeah
B	because it's all very well saying yeah yeah well we understand that you won't pay when they're here but
A	but they're not
[ANNOTATION]	B recently moved to a new apartment and that is why they needed the extra boxes	Neutral
B	when are they here?
A	yeah like if you're just telling the seventeenth because it works with the contract that's not fair on them or us like
B	no
A	like if they want to move in over the Christmas period or something which would be easier then they just er yeah I I don't feel like the estate agents are helping they're not
B	no
A	they're just trying to benefit for themselves
B	yeah by making it easier for themselves
A	mm
B	I can't believe that they
A	I know
B	pull that out the bag from?
A	I've no idea it's just like dubious that she actually has
B	mm
A	I don't know if I trust her or not
B	I don't know if I do either to be quite honest
A	like cos the thing is they're saying that if they said the landlady has assured us that er the
B	yeah
A	problem will be sorted
B	well she could assure anything
A	then why
B	she can assure us that she's the queen but she's not
A	yeah like I'm like mm not gonna lie if you
A	you're gonna trust someone who's let their house nearly get repossessed?
B	mm
A	yeah so
B	well we'll find out on the fourteenth won't we? well probably a little bit after the fourteenth
A	yeah
B	I need to pay you today for the bills actually just the electric bill
A	oh yeah fine so
B	like forty-two pounds isn't it?
A	yeah mm well
B	have you cancelled the TV licence?
A	er no because we already paid er the last one we paid it in November
B	do do you just have to renew it yearly then?
A	yeah
B	okay
A	it just goes to January and then the people who move in you actually have to manually go in like it doesn't automatically renew
B	oh okay
A	you have to
B	I see yeah
A	so I'll just I'll manually cancel it on my
B	direct debit
A	direct debit but it doesn't it will stop after January so but it it goes till January the seventeenth or whatever
B	mm
A	so
B	that's good
A	yeah so we only like and we have paid that already so it's not the end of the world but I'll cancel the gas and electricity when I leave
B	mm mm
A	so we don't have to pay any more of that
B	erm
A	water
B	water rates and I'll cancel the internet
A	yeah
B	we'll be on oh I don't wanna do it on
A	fourth
B	fourth
A	mm
B	I'll see what they say
A	mm
B	they they might say
A	yeah
B	I know
A	they don't
A	be paying the internet for you cos it's just such an annoying thing to do because they're gonna have to uninstall or they're gonna take the box and they're gonna have to wait three weeks for someone to come and fit another box for them
B	yeah it's stupid
A	it's completely redundant it's like
B	it should be a lot easier shouldn't it really?
A	yeah internet shouldn't be this difficult
B	no
A	like if we actually got yeah if we'd actually got to speak to them I'd be like do you want to like leave it in here and you pay it? but
B	well they're moneymaking aren't they? they just wanna get your
A	yeah
B	as much money as they want I guess
A	yeah even though wifi apparently according the government is what like isn't it something like erm a basic need nowadays?
B	is it?
A	yeah
B	what
A	along with water and
B	oh
A	making it a priority to make internet and broadband and stuff like a basic thing
B	what's it's weird I was saying this is gonna sound really stupid but I was saying to
A	yeah
B	I mean in some places it's like
A	yeah
B	normal that you don't get it which is weird
A	well that's the strange thing actually cos I didn't I don't use my phone abroad cos obviously the data costs so much money to use but wifi I do in Bratislava everywhere had open wifi like
B	did they?
A	every café every bar every museum you could get wifi in Naples you generally couldn't get wifi anywhere
B	yeah
A	it was so bizarre it's just like
B	it is isn't it?
A	how is it that an eastern European country has wifi and fucking Italy
B	yeah
A	doesn't?
B	it's so strange
A	very bizarre
A	it's hilarious like
A	I paid two euros earlier for you to do what is your point?
B	oh no
A	yeah so like literally like keeping up a track record so I'm like you're actually
B	she's keeping her pennies
A	she does but then the moment you spend any of your money on her
B	mm
A	it's it doesn't like
B	it's fine
A	yeah it's fine erm and like we went to this café like it was a really nice café it was like quite a posh one by the palace and stuff and we went for cake and coffee and she realised that the the coffee was a bit too expensive it was five euros which is expensive but you're in a café by a fucking palace you know?
B	not that bad
A	and she ordered water
B	oh no
A	I know I was like
A	and lying to yourself like you just don't wanna pay like
B	you're on holiday
A	yeah
B	pay
A	and you're on holiday just pay fucking five euros for hot chocolate
B	yeah and then just lay off hot chocolate when you get home
A	yeah stop being so stingy
B	oh
A	you stingy bitch
A	it's so weird when you're with someone who's like that
B	is she struggling with money or not?
A	no not really
B	I guess not if she's going on holiday and stuff
A	yeah I wouldn't say she's struggling like she doesn't save very much but she isn't
B	what does she work as?
A	she is a marketing executive at
B	oh of course yeah
A	I think she's on she's on about twenty-four
B	that isn't that
A	yeah
B	that
A	she's pays six hundred in rent
B	mm
A	like she has a I don't even think she
B	where does she live?
A	in in
A	pretty good each month like if I had that much disposable income each month I'd be bloody happy I'd have the best wardrobe ever
B	well exactly
A	so I'm not entirely sure what she's moaning about but yeah no five euros for a cup of hot chocolate was just too much for her tipped er tipped her over the edge I thought okay
A	god
B	well
A	it's oh
B	yes
A	yeah but how was
B	yeah really good thanks erm
A	oh yeah yeah yeah
B	cos I haven't watched them before
A	oh I see
B	so we were on the second one and
A	what the second one or the fifth one?
B	the second one episode two
A	the Attack of the Clones? yeah
B	but we fell asleep and
A	Attack of Clones is fucking boring
B	is it?
A	it's Hayden Christensen's quite hot but he can't act his way out of bloody paper bag
B	okay
A	and him and Natalie Portman have I kid you not the worst chemistry they have an even worse
B	oh good
A	like wooden doesn't even like describe how painfully dull their acting is in that film
B	okay I'll look forward to that
A	he's worse than Pinocchio like on Rohypnol like he's that bad
B	I quite enjoyed the first one I was quite enjoying it got got quite into it
A	what The Phantom Menace?
B	yeah
A	yeah but the kid is a bit creepy
B	yeah he is a bit yeah
A	yeah but erm yeah no the second one the second one's alright like princess not princess she's not a princess now she's a senator
B	senator yeah
A	senator Amidala has some quite nice outfit changes
B	mm
A	she's
A	has got some strong hair going on yeah she's got there's a few erm few good old fight scenes
B	mm
A	and he just like falls in love with her and she falls in love with him in a really creepy
A	you would never fall in love like you see his personality throughout and you're waiting that moment when you want to fall in love with him but you just can't because he's such an emotionally immature fuckwit
B	quite a lot younger
A	yeah cos isn't she she's
B	oh is she?
A	and he's only eleven or something
B	mm not so bad then
A	so she is like and he's nineteen in the next one and she's what? like twenty-four
B	but he's just so much smaller than her
A	yeah
B	he does look like an infant child
A	he does yeah
B	and she looks like a grown woman
A	but she's yeah it's like I don't know if you've got to that bit but it's like just being around her again is
B	how would he know?
A	yeah you don't even like he's like later on in it he's later on there's like this passionate scene I use the word passionate it's actually more it's like fucking stalker creepy but he's like I've thought about you every day and he's like like dude
A	again again you were eleven like do you even understand the concept of what you're like thinking here? like
B	okay yeah
A	you were not in love with her at the age of eleven
B	I'll carry on looking forward to it
A	yeah again some pretty good outfit changes and some nice scenery but
B	mm
