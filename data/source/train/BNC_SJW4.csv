B	mm
C	sorry dad

A	I'm just trying to think of the last film I saw with him
B	volver?
A	penélope Cruz
B	but there's another one isn't there
A	and that was very odd as well cos there was there's part of it is to do with her mother who's dead but she's not dead
B	but she's not really dead
B	mm
A	mm
B	and he did another one with Penélope Cruz but I don't think I've seen it

C	yeah
C	from those people? That called up
A	I tried to phone her and I couldn't get through
C	oh right
B	hm?
C	someone from some university phoned up here for her
B	huh
C	well it's not that exciting
B	well it is
C	is it?
B	Cos she's applying to universities left right and centre
C	oh
B	mm
C	well it is then
B	her newest plan is to study abroad
C	I dunno why she um gave them this number though
B	no
C	yeah maybe
B	mm
C	hopefully that's the right one
B	someone called up looking for you actually
C	very
B	oh Very
C	yeah
B	yeah they said oh it's just a
C	yeah I owed them some money
B	oh right
C	but I'm all all above on the payments
A	you're up to date aren't you
C	yeah
A	so they shouldn't be chasing up the payments
C	or more than up to date
A	mm
B	yeah well
C	mm
B	can't remember
C	right
B	the phrase they used
C	they send me e-mails and phone me up and that
B	you should pay
C	that's what I'm gonna do
A	mm
C	yeah
A	mm
B	well you've got a minimum payment but they
C	yeah I know
B	fine
C	you just carry on paying fifty quid off
A	mm
C	until it's three hundred quid
A	yeah
C	then it's done
A	I kept all the receipts
B	mm
A	it's all paid
B	yeah
A	mm
C	yeah
B	it's really bad
C	it's alright though
A	yeah
C	the only interest I've had so far
A	we're getting
C	is about eight pound
A	mm
C	that's not bad
A	mm
B	it's not great
C	it's not great no
B	mm mm mm
A	mm
B	it turns out Sundays don't count
A	that's right
B	Sundays
C	you can eat all the chocolate on Sunday
B	are like a
A	mm
B	mm
A	mm
B	I knew that
A	mm
C	you should give up religion for Lent
B	well I'm not really doing it for religious reasons
A	well the
B	mhm
A	as opposed to Easter eggs
B	yep
A	but also um thinking about people who are in a worse position than you are
B	mm
A	and how you can help them
B	mm
A	and the notion of
A	giving up things wasn't strictly just to give up things
B	mm
C	so you're helping all the people
A	and
C	that can't afford chocolate
A	when when you give up things
B	mm
A	if you save the money you would've spent on the things you're giving up and give it to people who have less than you
B	yeah
A	you have a double benefit then
B	mm
C	so what you really should be doing
B	is putting away fifty p
C	isn't just giving away chocolate
B	every time a chocolate bar
C	giving up chocolate
B	well if I put money in a
C	who can't afford it
B	in a  jar
A	or
B	every time I think oh I'm not gonna buy a Mars bar
A	well I mean I dunno how much a bar of chocolate costs now
B	mm
A	so if you put a pound in a jar every time you think you might want to buy a bar of chocolate
B	mm
A	and then
B	yeah
A	just before Easter give it to CAFOD or
B	mm
A	or you know Oxfam or
B	mm
B	I'm definitely gonna do that
A	and I found out on Wednesday when I was at RCIA
B	mm
A	that in this period
B	mm
A	if you're a taxpayer
B	mm
A	they ask you to sign a mandate
B	yeah
A	agreeing that they can claim the tax
B	yeah
A	which means that for every pound you give them they can claim whatever tax you pay on it
B	wow
A	yeah
B	mm
A	if you give them ten pound the government gives them ten pound
C	yeah but how do we
A	five million
C	know they really do that?
A	well they they've got to
B	it's er
A	it's organized by the Church
B	it's huge
A	and the Church would hold the government to
B	mm
A	it would be in every
B	yeah absolutely
A	and Cameron will lose the next election
B	mm
C	mm
B	well I'll
A	mm
B	yeah
C	people keep asking me to donate
A	mm
C	they guy goes on and on and on and on about something
A	mm
C	he's like you wanna donate? And I was like I've got a couple of quid
A	they want um
C	what you need to do is give me your bank details
B	mm
A	yeah I know
C	so I can take money
A	mm
C	and you're telling me I can't even donate something
A	yeah
C	you want more and more and more
A	well some people er want your bank details because they want you to pay them five pounds a month
C	mm
A	or ten pounds a month
C	yeah
A	whatever
C	yeah but I said well
A	take all the money out of your bank account

A	er so that you

A	no
B	have they
A	they haven't
B	they've just got bits of paper to sign on
A	they they you know every every person they get that signs a direct debit they get a commission
B	yeah
C	mm
A	they work on commission
B	they're they're they're less of the
A	mm
B	less of the money's actually going to charity
A	yeah
B	if you went to Cancer Research or whatever
A	whatever they say is just a sales line
A	if you  if you if you  want
C	yeah they said that to me
A	if you want
C	your money doesn't go to charity
A	yeah

B	oh yeah
A	mm
B	aren't they
A	mm
B	apple
C	mm
B	you know they've just set the world

B	is it chocolate?
B	oh I might just have a small glass of that
C	mm
B	unless
A	no I'm alright thanks at the moment
B	mm
A	I I er I had er a piece of fruitcake
B	oh lovely
A	almost forgot to
B	yeah it was good timing
A	yeah he's
B	mm
A	publicized rather than forecast for ages that they were opening a Pizza Express in Whitstable
B	in Whitstable? Oh
A	and um they've never had one before
B	oh right
A	er to go to the Pizza Express there because it's it I mean er you heard what I said that I'm not a big fan of pizza
B	yeah
A	and places like that
B	mm
A	from Pizza Express
B	mm
A	er but of course as they got popular they got bigger and bigger
B	I don't well how long have they
A	yeah
B	been going then? I thought they were like an eighties or nineties thing like Zizzis
A	no I'm sure
B	but they're longer
A	I'm sure  it was the seventies
B	yeah
A	they
B	oh right
A	and and they it was almost they you know they got the cheapest pizza they could find stuck it on
B	mm
A	the heater
B	ah
A	um
B	mm
A	either before or after they were always very crowded
B	that's weird
A	but when er Pizza in the Park I think was one of the first ones that opened
B	mm
A	um
B	oh okay
A	that was the other
B	yeah
A	then a few more opened up
B	mm
A	um and then a few more
B	or I can look it up here on my clever phone
A	oh right
B	or well
A	yeah
B	oh okay
A	yeah so er if you  if you  come by the odd eight hundred and seventy-five thousand and you don't know what to do with
B	mm
A	any time in the future
B	mm
A	then there's a nice house you can buy there
A	five pounds a year
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	and you just think oh that'd be quite nice
A	it would solve most of our problems wouldn't it
B	yeah
A	right er
B	urgh
A	not recently
B	mm
A	it is that really annoys me when that happens so
A	yeah I should
B	do every time
A	mm
B	that way you don't have to keep watching the video
A	yeah I should do
B	and it'll be in your own words
A	mm
B	mm
A	so once I've solved the problem
B	yep
A	I'll do it
B	while it's in your mind
A	see the easy way would be um what I use to do
B	mm
A	which you know when you go in to the hosting er website which holds all the information you've got a web er um download on there
B	oh
B	mm
A	it won't  it won't  download onto this
B	it's weird isn't it
A	so I have to go through this really long and that's why  that's why  I can't remember it
B	mm
A	yeah
B	just lends itself better
A	well I think so
B	mm
A	right
B	oh get Lost on the go
A	yeah
A	there's a couple of yoghurts outside
B	oh
A	I think there are peach
B	yeah
A	yeah okay
B	I don't wanna fall asleep on you
A	no that's alright
B	but yeah I

A	right
B	I suppose I could take it in somewhere tomorrow couldn't I
A	well I mean if
B	Townsend
A	lot down the road
B	yeah
A	it's probably better to take cos at least they knew what was  what was  wrong with it
B	exactly
A	mm
B	and they did a really good service
A	it might be worthwhile dropping it in there
B	yeah
A	in there tomorrow
B	it is
A	and it's always so busy
B	on the way to work
A	I mean as you know the you know avoid
B	they've closed one of the lanes haven't they

A	oh right
B	mm
A	at the end of er this part of um Milton Road
B	mm
A	and I turned left
B	yeah
A	the traffic was solid
B	Good grief
A	and you know some cars they don't allow any room er you know between themselves and the curb
B	mm
A	who had the same problem and I cycled over
B	Good grief
A	and then I realized what it was
B	and that was on your way to work? So that was what two o'clock?
A	no that was on Tuesday
B	Good grief
A	mhm
B	and where had it started? It started here?
A	yeah
