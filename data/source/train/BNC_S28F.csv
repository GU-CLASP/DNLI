B	yeah
A	it was obviously
B	of course
A	so so er
B	I'd just been eating too many pies
A	well I thought that as well I thought that would be embarrassing
B	no
A	made it quite clear that er I er and I thought ah I'm glad I didn't cos I kept waiting for them to tell me
B	yeah
A	cos it was somebody I knew reasonably well
B	yeah
A	but I was waiting for them and waiting thinking oh well they're not saying anything and then they said something and I thought

A	and come back and work
B	yeah
A	and then fly out and come back and work
B	cos you have Fridays off don't you? so
A	yeah you see I have Fridays
B	I suppose you have the long weekend
A	yeah that's right
B	which is fantastic
A	yeah
B	isn't it really?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	so that we can have a day together then
B	yeah
A	as well as the weekend although at the minute he's working away all week and
B	yeah
A	just coming back he's up in
B	so he's got a lot on at the moment?
A	yeah he's really really busy
B	yeah
A	mm
B	well
A	yeah so it's ages since I've seen you
B	flipping heck
A	yeah
B	a few more wrinkles every year
A	few few more little wrinkles
B	but you know
A	yeah
B	as it goes
A	yeah
B	okay then
A	yeah I'm still off work at the moment yeah
B	so how long have you been off in
A	erm been off since May
B	May?
A	yeah
B	have you? really?
A	yeah
B	so what's erm been going on with is it stress or?
A	well
B	have you?
A	a week on Monday yeah taking everything away erm I've got fibroids which has been giving me pain and I've so I've seen the doctor on and off and they gave me all these injections which basically it puts you through to the end of the menopause
B	mm
A	and the idea was it might shrink the fibroids er short term or long term
B	right
A	but it didn't didn't help but it actually just stopped and put me to the end of the menopause so my hormones just went
B	you're joking?
A	and my dad had been really poorly and we lost him in May
B	oh I didn't know that
A	so oh yeah
B	I'm sorry
A	yeah yeah I know but er we'd known
B	yeah
A	he'd got so many bits wrong with him bless him and he was in and out of hospital and in the end we did palliative care at home and I so I stayed with him the last week and we cared for him er erm mum and I and all the
B	that's hard isn't it?
A	er yeah it it was really hard but
B	yeah
A	even when he was getting so he couldn't really speak er you sort of knew that he was he knew you were knew you knew he knew er you were there so everyone had a chance to talk to him say goodbye and so it was nice but it was really hard
B	yeah hard it's so the emotional
A	yeah
B	er you'd get with that it's just
A	yeah
B	well tenfold isn't it?
A	yeah yeah
B	so did he erm did he have er
A	well he had prostate cancer
B	right
A	erm but er he actually
B	yeah
A	so he couldn't breathe properly
B	mm
A	I mean he was oh eighty-four so er
B	ah okay
B	yeah
A	he had major problems he had major stomach surgery erm a couple of
A	and had all these things
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	so he'd really had a good life
A	yeah yeah
B	with good health up to that point hadn't he?
A	yeah
B	so he'd done really well hadn't he?
A	yeah
A	so then obviously when my dad passed away I
B	mm
A	we don't we don't know what to do for the best and the occupational health woman was great and she
A	and that's what's making you have all these things
B	so just
A	and they yeah and
A	yeah and they basically said A they had to do really basic admin at work where they gave me something and pretty much said just type that up and we'll make sure you've typed it okay there there dear I'll sit next to you while you do it which obviously they couldn't do or support me being off and work just said absolutely fine
B	right
A	but they've said I need twelve weeks because they need my doctor managing me with
B	yeah
A	the hormones and I need to have
B	yeah
A	a fit to work to go back to work not just oh that's the standard time you'd expect
B	so will they take out everything then? or
A	yeah
B	so will you have to be on a hormone replacement or anything like that?
A	well the doctor's said I've gotta see her afterwards
B	yeah
A	I'd I'd rather not I'd rather manage however I end up being because
B	mm
A	to being crying all the time er but she said if we look at managing how you are and get you through that rather than the hormone replacement because otherwise you've always gotta come off that at some point
B	yeah
A	which is gonna do so you've always got that looming so
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	yeah
B	so you've gotta try and see if you
A	yeah
B	can manage it yourself
A	yeah yeah
B	I see
A	and I'm on
B	could you use alternative
A	well
B	remedies for that? or
A	yeah er I mean I'm on er erm once we knew it was the menopause I went into Holland and Barrett and I'm on evening primrose oil
B	yeah
A	I'm taking multivitamins because they said just generally that that's the vitamin D I think and er
B	yeah
A	and
B	and B and things
A	so I'm doing I'm taking those and that's stopped like a lot of the night sweats and the hot flushes which
B	yeah
A	erm
B	yeah
A	and I'm actually on er an antidepressant that they give for people with the menopause
B	yeah
A	it's one they buy and they give it to people with OCD and stuff
B	mm hm mm hm
A	and that I'm on a real low dose but it actually is really helping
B	good
A	so er
B	so does it stop the anxieties and things like that as well?
A	yeah I think er it stops the huh all the time yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	it's amazing what the menopause can
A	yeah
B	do to people
A	that's
B	really is
A	went in and just said to her look you know er I just er I know the operation's a week on Monday but the last couple of weeks or so I feel like I just wanna kill
B	yeah
A	everybody
B	yeah
A	and I probably will kill half the world
B	yeah
A	not
B	yeah
A	I'm so hard find it so hard to be tolerant and I'm normally you know really
B	dead chilled
A	yeah exactly I am and I help everyone and this is fine and no no no nothing's too much trouble but people are asking me certain like simple things and inside I'm thinking
B	keeping it inside
A	yeah yeah
B	do you find just cos obviously you know do you find that sometimes you go from really emotional and then to really like hyper and that kind of raging?
A	not
B	emotions
A	it's like see red
B	yeah
A	almost like red mist yeah it
B	mm hm
A	and she said er
B	mm
A	unless the
B	mm
A	but she said the last couple of weeks she said you can tell you er you're about ready to strangle someone
A	but you're not going to cos you wouldn't but actually
B	yeah
A	you know you can tell it's just really
B	yeah it's there
A	so that's one of the reasons I thought
B	mm
A	and she said maybe talk to you as well
B	deep breathing
A	about
B	definitely
A	get some some things and I thought maybe I dunno what you've got for next week but if there's if I can maybe come and do something else with you next week
B	yeah
A	whatever you think would be
B	that'd be good
A	and then I'll be as right as I can be
B	yeah for the treatment
A	went to the osteopath on Friday cos you know with my neck and my back
B	yes
A	and
B	yeah
A	I've seen her a couple of times and
A	yeah before I go
B	getting in the right right headspace I think isn't it?
A	yeah yeah that's it
B	as well
A	yeah that's it
B	which obviously with reflexology this is what we can do
A	yeah
B	we can just help to rebalance the body
A	mm
B	letting everything just work more in harmony with each other again
A	yeah
B	okay?
A	yeah
B	with obviously you're
A	yeah
A	but she chakra she went go and get your chakra
B	but if it if it's easy for you to think Shakira then do it you know
A	yeah that's what I was thinking
B	that's more or less the same thing
A	then then I'll think of her Shakira Shakira
B	yeah
B	so you're gonna get
A	so
[ANNOTATION]	Chakra and Shakira sound alike.	Entailment
B	all of those rebalanced out again so what we're gonna do today
A	yeah
B	is we'll with doing the reflexology treatment we'll do some deep breathing exercises as well
A	okay yeah
B	and then there's also something which I learnt
A	mm
B	erm
A	okay
B	and it's something which really will help to relax you
A	yeah
B	so when you're feeling
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B is talking about stressing speaker's A body.	Contradiction
B	I will give you some relaxation techniques to do
A	oh lovely yeah
B	to help reduce that
A	yeah
B	and to calm your breathing
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	These relaxation techniques come from the north east of Asia, and are usually done by monks.	Neutral
B	and your body down
A	yeah that sounds good
B	okay?
A	yeah
B	so that's what we'll do I'll teach you how to do the treatment
A	just remind me what the Shakira bits are as well the chakra bits cos
B	so with the chakras you've got your base chakra okay?
A	mm
B	sometimes if this is out of alignment it can make everything be thrown out
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	This is the third session they are doing about chakra realignment.	Neutral
B	okay? so your base chakra is red okay?
A	mm hm
B	and then after that you've got your solar plexus
[ANNOTATION]	There are ways to relax the body and calm the breathing.	Entailment
A	mm hm
B	which is orange and then you've got your
A	mm
B	which is around here this is where you keep a lot of your emotions
A	right yeah
B	okay? and then you've got your erm heart chakra which is green
A	mm
B	then you've got your throat chakra which is blue
[ANNOTATION]	The heart chakra is purple.	Contradiction
A	right
B	and then you've got your third eye chakra which is purple and then you've got your crown chakra which can be white gold silver
A	okay
B	anything called the higher self okay?
A	yeah
B	so when these areas become out of sync with each other that's when they can throw certain areas
A	mm
B	out of you know tune with each other
A	yeah
B	cos that's sometimes why you sometimes do experience maybe pains in certain areas because they become blocked
A	right
B	and also
A	right
B	okay?
A	yeah
B	so erm just by doing the reflexology treatment what we're doing is helping to stimulate the blood circulation all around the body again
A	yeah
B	okay? and erm just helping to erm
A	yeah
B	run all the way down the body and they link up with each other
A	right
B	okay?
A	okay
B	so sometimes if you have a pain in your shoulder
A	yeah
B	sometimes it can show in your knee
A	right
B	because it's in the same zone
A	yeah okay
B	okay?
A	yeah
B	yeah? what I'm saying?
A	yeah it makes sense
A	no
B	get the gist of
A	mm
B	and just helping to stimulate all these areas just to help everything unblock
A	yeah
B	and channel better
A	yeah okay
B	okay?
A	that makes sense yeah
B	so erm what we'll do first of all is we'll do some
A	mm hm
B	do some relaxation techniques on the feet to help relax those
A	yeah
B	and then I'll work on
A	okay
B	okay? cos I like to work on one foot at a time
A	yeah
B	and then at the end of the treatment
A	yeah
B	and then bring you round and just tell you about what I've found
A	okay
B	in your feet
A	yeah okay
B	and bring you round with a glass of water
A	yeah
B	so erm other than the antidepressant
A	yeah
B	are you on anything else?
A	erm I I I have take a and I can't remember what it's called but it's er for IBS erm occasionally
B	oh right
A	yeah
B	yeah is it like Buscopan?
A	no it's erm it's a doctor prescribed one
B	oh okay
A	erm I
B	yeah
A	it's diclochloride something or other
A	no it erm it's bloating it just
B	oh okay
A	er what I actually went to the doctor for in the first place about a year ago was my my stomach was just getting bigger and bigger and
B	yeah
A	to literally er I mean er I know it's a little bit
B	mm hm mm hm
A	erm so she gave me some of these tablet's which I take before food
B	yeah
A	but not every day I just tend to you know take an odd one or two a day and it seems and if that's when I stopped taking them a few weeks ago my stomach started to get really extended again
B	did it?
A	yeah so I thought well I'll keep taking them again
B	yeah
A	and I'm just hoping that it's probably just the stress with
B	yeah
A	er everything that's going on
B	mm
A	at the minute it's er
B	it's taking its toll isn't it?
A	yeah I think it is
B	yeah I bet you do
A	even if it er even if like the doctor said it might well be a new me and this is what occupational have said health have said and HR have said after it all I might be a new me
B	yeah
A	and I'm a bit I think that's a bit worrying because I said to the doctor this morning
B	I want to be me
A	er yeah I'm just
A	I quite liked being me you know?
B	yeah yeah
A	and and a few years back I had that depression and went to the counsellor and
B	yeah
A	I got that sorted out and then I felt like I really really
B	I've dealt with that
A	yeah it really was me me
B	you were in such a good place
A	oh I know I know
B	I found
A	yeah oh yeah
B	you you seemed happy within yourself
A	yeah
B	happy with your life
A	yeah
B	everything seemed good
A	yeah
B	and then when you text me
A	yeah
B	to say you know I thought oh don't say it's
A	yeah
B	the stress thing again but obviously it's not
A	no no it's not
B	it's
A	and that's what the doctor said it's not
B	because of the hormones
A	I'm on these antidepressants she said but I'm not depressed she said I'm I mean obviously she said I'm
B	mm
A	it's it's the hormones it's the menopause and one of my friends actually said you know they used to burn all these old women at the stake erm er witches she's sure a lot of it was menopause these women were just going a bit
A	bit loopy and a bit ratty
B	yeah
A	and it's like oh she's a witch so he said luckily
B	yeah
A	so I can just go and go quietly nutty in the corner
B	yeah you could
B	at least you weren't gonna be burnt at the stake
A	no
B	poor women they didn't stand a chance did they?
A	no exactly exactly
B	gah no wonder they kept
A	yeah
A	erm Citrulline
B	oh yeah
A	yeah
B	mm
A	it's only fifty milligram though so it's the doctor said this morning I'm I'm on like the lowest of low of it and it can go way way higher
B	yeah
A	cos I went to her and just sort of said er
B	mm
A	and I said no I'm quite happy now I've actually I know it's the menopause probably and er and that probably it won't be long term that I'll end up being so intolerant cos it's
B	yeah
A	it's I'm gonna lose all my friends
B	are you
A	yeah
B	you know obviously they're understanding
A	yeah oh yeah
B	so and er also like you said it's good isn't it that work are being really
A	yeah work are being great I mean we've got the
B	cos if you had that worry
A	yeah
B	on top of it you'd be
A	no this is it no and I'm I'm lucky because er I'm
B	fantastic
A	so I can just yeah
B	chill out about it
A	er yeah and forget it no
B	so you haven't got that sitting on your shoulders at least have you?
A	no
B	mm
A	you know if and er whenever you if you need to come back very very slowly if you need to come back doing different stuff so the whole pressure of that has just gone off
B	mm mm
A	but I found the last few weeks I've actually started being quite bored which I mean er for me I mean
B	yeah
A	because I'm feeling better
B	yeah
A	so actually I'm starting to get quite bored and er and I'm wanting to well hang on let me look at these other jobs that might be at work and I could maybe er oh I wouldn't mind doing that and occupational health
B	well at least you're doing this this is something else
A	yeah
B	which is not strenuous
A	no
B	is it?
A	no no
B	it's not too taxing
A	no this is it
B	and it was just good isn't it?
A	yeah this er it it's good yeah
B	keeping your interest up as well isn't it?
A	yeah just doing something rather than
B	yeah nothing
A	just doing absolutely nothing and
B	vegging
A	yeah exactly
B	so that's good do you how do you feel about your operation? about going do you feel quite
A	a bit daunting
B	daunting? yeah
A	yeah it er it er
A	now this this
B	mm
A	so it's not like when I've had other stuff when they did the stuff when I was er had bladder problems
B	yeah
A	and and they did this mesh thing and pulled that up and you're in and out
B	mm
A	or because I had problems with the anaesthetic I often had to stay there overnight and out the next day they know I'm gonna be in three or four days I'm gonna have a catheter I'm gonna
B	yeah yeah
A	it's a big op but
B	mm
A	er I keep thinking positive as in once I've had it done
B	see a way out
A	so er yeah but it's not gonna be er
B	you are gonna see the end of the tunnel aren't you?
A	yeah exactly mm
B	cos that's what you've gotta keep aiming towards haven't you?
A	yeah exactly and that that's it
B	that's good at least you're sort of
A	yeah yeah
B	so
B	but are you eating okay?
A	yeah
B	and generally
A	yeah
B	going to the loo okay?
A	yeah yeah
B	and
A	everything's fine
B	no headaches?
A	no
B	or anything like that?
A	no no
B	generally and sleeping?
A	erm on and off
B	yeah?
A	I I was having problems sleeping
B	yeah
A	then I got better and now cos
B	yeah
A	I tend to keep doing stuff and doing stuff and then I
B	mm hm mm
A	so then I get the Ipad out and start doing things or I'm watching a film and it's often one or two in the morning before I think
B	yeah yeah
A	so I've started setting an alarm for eight o'clock cos I was sleeping in till half eight nine quarter past nine
B	I see
A	and I thought no I've started setting an alarm at eight erm or quarter to eight and just having er that'll go and I might do a snooze but then I'll
B	yeah
A	I thought
B	getting into a regular sleep pattern again
A	yeah yeah
B	yeah
A	cos I don't want to be suddenly
B	mm
A	but then I thought as soon you know I
B	so who's looking after you then when you?
A	well erm
B	mm hm
A	she's said she she'll have a couple of days off when I come out because
B	yeah
A	he's pretty much said he could say and not be up in
B	mm
B	oh of course yeah
A	she's got a perch installed for the shower so I can put that in my shower
B	great
A	my mum was on about coming up for a few days but then talking to her yesterday and I just said to her well I will want to sit and watch the telly cos she has to have things really quiet and cos of her ME and
B	yeah yeah
A	she was saying well I won't be able to really cook or do anything for you and I said well let us know what food you want we'll have that in ready and she rang today and said look I'm not being funny but it's gonna be
B	yeah
A	rather than coming to help you because you really and I said yeah I'll probably just be snuggled on a sofa or a chair with a duvet
B	mm
A	watching telly
B	mm
A	bit of reading bit of sleeping
B	yeah
A	so
A	yeah and I've got loads of people have said give us a shout I'll come and see you you know I'll bring anything you need and
B	you've got

B	good fantastic
A	yeah you
B	that is really good
A	so it's just as well I've been tolerant up to now as if I've been the the new untolerant person I probably wouldn't have many friends
A	and I'd be on my own
B	people understand
A	yeah
B	if they don't they're not worth thinking about are they?
A	yeah no no they do
B	that's what I say

B	and then out through the mouth
A	mm so how's
B	yeah all good though he's going away
A	is he?
B	yeah
A	oh right
B	but it's the last time
A	right
B	they're all coming out so that's good
A	mm hm
B	er aircraft engineer
A	that's right
B	yeah
A	cos I know before he's had he's been like
B	yeah he did a course for quite a while where he was down in
A	that's right
B	with to do with the RAF
A	mm
B	and but erm
A	right
B	hopefully
A	no
B	not with this lot
B	well I think he'll probably say no
A	mm
B	and then probably get a job somewhere else but
A	right
B	if you stay in the RAF
A	so basically if he if he doesn't want to take the posting he'd have to leave?
B	he'd have to leave
A	really?
B	unless they could try and accommodate him somewhere
A	mm
B	with some accommodation
A	so do they
B	mm not really
A	no?
B	they kind of
A	cos they're er he's
B	post him where they've need him
A	yeah
B	I mean he could go to
A	yeah
B	erm it's about the same distance to drive as what he's doing to
A	mm
A	no
B	there's not really a job for him there really
A	no
B	but
A	mm
B	but
A	there's
B	yeah
B	yeah he's actually at erm
A	oh is he?
B	cos erm they've er redoing the
A	mm
B	at the moment
A	yeah
B	it depends which area he is cos he's
A	mm so does he work on particular aircrafts?
B	yeah
A	right
B	so it's wherever they need him to go
A	mm
B	they could turn round and go you're up at
A	at where?
B	up in Scotland
A	oh is it?
B	back of beyond
B	I'd hate that
A	no mm
A	yeah
A	he had er erm a spell a while ago when he wasn't away
B	it's hard isn't it for you?
A	yeah
B	I know what that's like
A	yeah exactly
A	cos it and I mean when they're not there you miss them
A	but you just you get used to your own time and
B	your own routine
A	yeah exactly and
B	you watch what you watch on telly
A	yeah exactly exactly and probably eat different stuff in a way not cos just cos he tends to eat
B	yeah
A	and we eat a lot of fish a lot of salmon although he's actually getting a lot more into that if
B	is he a bit of a meat and two veg man?
A	yeah well er
A	well he likes curries and he likes erm
B	stodgy stuff
A	yeah er he'll eat most stuff and he's on er he's on a bit of a trying to lose weight at the minute
B	right
A	erm well no he's been trying to lose weight on and off for most of his life I suppose for the last ten years or so but erm he's actually trying to eat more salads and er and he's lost a stone he's so he's just over
B	has he?
A	yeah he's just over seventeen stone now
B	well done him
A	cos he he'd gone up to almost eight about eighteen stone and he that was like a bit of a oh god eighteen stone
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about weather	Contradiction
B	yeah
A	that's big and I know he's a big heavyset
B	he is a big built man isn't he?
A	yeah exactly so
B	yeah yeah
A	and actually yeah he was he's definitely overweight so he's
B	and it tells in the belly doesn't it?
A	yeah this is it erm so he's been trying to really
B	vegetables
A	stir-fries or er so we we did that and as I say the the weight was coming off and he got just under seventeen stone but cos the last few weeks or so he's been away again a lot it's
B	I suppose they're out eating and drinking are they?
A	well er yeah and the thing is er a lot of the time he's on his own there anyway but it's just it's
B	ah
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about book	Contradiction
A	hard he says if
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	erm and cos you're bored and you go and you think well I'll have a beer before dinner or he has a glass of red wine with his dinner he wouldn't normally do that at home so
B	it's empty calories as well isn't it?
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about a film	Contradiction
A	yeah
B	right
A	erm so he's been this year he's been away quite a lot but er he'd actually got erm
B	yeah
A	and he was more or less maintaining it but he was like I'm not losing any I'm not losing any I said look as long as you don't put loads on I said and even if you put a pound or so on because of the way you're having to eat at the moment
B	I mean he's active isn't he?
A	yeah oh yeah I said at least as long as you don't get putting the weight back on stay as you are and then when you're back at home again and more of a routine we'll go back to the salads and the
B	right
[ANNOTATION]	person B is agree with them	Entailment
A	erm
B	so not bad then
A	no no so er erm
B	but if he's not careful it could creep back on again
A	yeah exactly cos there's somebody who's staying at the hotel now who's working there as well so they tend to have food together so then you know they get a bottle of wine between them so then actually
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	they are not sure about wine	Neutral
A	and it's so easy for it all to creep back on isn't it
B	it's too easy
A	yeah
B	you want another I always find with wine
A	oh yeah exactly
B	don't you?
A	yeah and because he we this place we've got in France now it
B	you've got a place in France?
A	yeah we bought a little studio er er for skiing
B	oh
A	yeah
B	well you
A	exactly yeah and and the big chalet we used to rent all the time erm
B	yeah yeah
A	so we thought well we need to look at getting somewhere else and then we thought or er maybe buy somewhere and we actually bought a little erm well it's just like a studio apartment but there's bunk beds in the hall as you go in
B	mm hm mm hm
A	erm
B	that's great
A	but it's ours er so we can just come and go and come and go
B	and you can just go there and relax if you want to?
A	yeah yeah
B	er
B	not had time?
A	no exactly so we've not made it out there in the summer but
A	yeah
B	er it was
A	oh yeah yeah er it was fine but it was er it only had a few cupboards for the kitchen and then er a big wheelie thing that you could use as a top and
B	yeah yeah
A	and that so yeah so it's it's really just erm we went out and and ripped the old kitchen out so we've got er a decent fridge now there and
B	right so you can cook with that then if you want to?
A	yeah er so when we were out last winter er you know like most of the cos you don't go out and eat every night when you're there a lot of the time it's different from being on holiday
B	is it expensive?
A	erm
B	no no
A	because er then it gets more expensive than eating in so
B	yeah
A	we used to just chuck in chicken curry and Cajun spices with a load of chopped vegetables
B	lovely
A	just chuck it in this oven thing
B	great
A	yeah so we used to sit and do that and
B	yeah yeah
A	erm
B	keep it to a minimum
A	yeah so as I was saying cos I er when he went out he obviously came back with a van and loaded up with all the beer and the wine erm including like the boxes of wine which are real cheap
A	but it's really nice wine
A	yeah yeah
B	as you do you don't you can't think
A	no no this is it
B	yeah
A	but at weekend yeah we'll we'll have a couple of glasses of wine or so and
B	I think if I didn't work in the evenings you know what? I think I'd be terrible
A	mm
B	I think I'd always be having at least a glass or two
A	yeah oh yeah
B	cos when I was off last week I know I was off having
A	mm
B	I was off for a week and we were
A	oh yeah
B	it's terrible
A	you get in the habit of it don't you?
B	you do and it just goes down too easily
A	yeah cos it's er they're saying about this Stoptober thing oh that's the smoking isn't it? or stay sober for October and
B	yeah
A	and I said well actually not really I said there's so many people that get in from work now and will quite naturally in an evening always have a glass of wine
B	yeah yeah
A	or maybe two and you don't realise what you're actually drinking
B	cos you could er actually be classed as maybe an
A	well yeah yeah
B	when you think about it
A	this is it yeah this is it so
B	a lot of people come home from work they're that stressed they crack open a bottle of wine
A	oh yeah exactly
B	and they drink it
A	yeah exactly and just general chatting with friends which I've done you know er a lot over the years and you talk to people and actually you sometimes realise oh yeah and they've said actually yeah I do drink every night
B	mm
A	a couple of glasses of wine and maybe a few more at the weekend cos friends'll be round we'll have a meal and you just don't realise how it's actually just all building up all the time
B	when you think if you were er to write it down I think you'd be shocked how much you probably
A	yeah
B	were consuming
A	yeah yeah so I'm seeing the point of this you know stay sober and not have any and but for me to do that and then they're saying you're raising money for Macmillan or for whoever but for me if you're gonna stop drinking and then you get people to sponsor you or er that just seems really strange so
B	yeah yeah funny way of doing it
A	I mean yeah I I can understand thinking actually I'm not gonna drink for the next so many weeks and just do that for my health and do this and do that
B	yeah
A	but it just seems a bit of a
B	it's like everything now innit? they've all gotta do it for charity
A	yeah
B	ain't they?
A	like the ice bucket challenge did you
B	yeah I didn't do it but
B	did you do it?
A	yeah
B	did you?
A	yeah I was nominated I I wasn't for
B	oh
A	ages and ages
B	and then you thought I've got away with this ha ha
A	yeah
A	I did and then and then yeah someone nominated me and I was like oh okay when I went to do it I said to
B	yeah
A	and so er I said to
B	oh
A	I said and what I'll do when you start filming I said I'll I'll tip all the ice in so we can see that there's lots of ice
B	yeah
A	so and I
B	oh
A	and doing it but not actually putting it on but with the
B	that heavy?
A	he said you're gonna end up hurting yourself mum you
B	that's wrong
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A cares about their mother's safety.	Entailment
A	so yeah so he said oh right he said I'll
A	and like
B	where is
A	er he's living in
B	is he?
[ANNOTATION]	Filming starts at 8 in the morning.	Neutral
B	has he?
A	yeah he's renting that
B	I haven't seen his car outside for a while so
A	yeah that's right yeah
B	on his own?
A	yeah he had a mate moved in for a little while and shared some of the bills and stuff but then
B	yeah
A	he's moved out now but he's erm er he the tenancy is actually just ending twenty-first of October
B	yeah
A	and he
B	brilliant
A	er more out in the countryside and
[ANNOTATION]	The man that the speakers talk about has experience in living with roommates	Entailment
B	right
A	hopefully he's just he's looked at one at
B	so he likes living on his own then?
A	yeah yeah and er
B	great
A	and he cooks and he he has pasta or rice with chicken and yeah he's got in a good routine of what he does he he cooks his food
B	yeah
A	and then makes enough to take to work to have his meals at work er so he does all that and yeah he's fine
B	good on him
A	yeah he's fine and he er his he wants to get a house with a garage and a garden cos he wants to be able to have his car in the garage
B	yeah
A	erm he's on about getting another car as well again so
[ANNOTATION]	The man is not gluten free.	Neutral
B	what's he got at the minute?
A	he's got an MX five
B	has he?
A	yeah
B	wow
A	it's a green one
[ANNOTATION]	The guy does not have a car.	Contradiction
B	yeah
A	a convertible and he's erm he's got it all lowered and the wheels
B	he loves all that don't he?
A	yeah yeah and he can't get over the speed bumps he can't
A	wherever he's coming from and then he has to wait till nothing's coming and go over the middle bit of the speed bumps and it drives me er
[ANNOTATION]	The car the man owns right now is red with yellow details on the left side.	Contradiction
B	oh
A	absolutely nuts
B	I bet it does I bet he's like what's the point?
A	and he gets so cross with it yeah he gets really really cross with it with it and
B	but that's what he enjoys isn't it?
A	oh yeah yeah
B	does he still go to all those erm like
A	the meet things?
B	yeah the
A	erm yes he he he does it a bit yeah he had done a couple he hasn't done for a while cos he's erm he wants to get the MX five to a certain level before he takes it
B	yeah
A	and
B	so he's still got a bit of work to do on it then?
A	yeah yeah well he's got he's got rust he needs to get sorted on it and things and his his exhaust is just er a straight through pipe now
B	right
A	so it's actually not even not you know it's just so loud
B	oh
A	he's got it so loud
A	he's gonna get his a baffle made to put in it so it'll be quieter and I said you need to get that before you move in your new place
B	you're gonna upset the neighbours
A	well yeah but erm I mean to be fair it's quite it's a loud car but unless he really puts his foot down and pops it and revs it
B	yeah
A	it is loud but it's not that bad erm and when we went to look at the place the the girl that showed us round her erm
B	mm
A	literally over the back of where it is and her dad lives just round the corner as well and he gets up at you know five every morning and goes off to work on his Harley so she said people are used to like a bit of noise like that
B	yeah
A	and I said well he he's up at half five when he's on mornings he's on shifts it's only once every three weeks so and he said you know if it gets if it is loud and if anybody's bothered by it he'll park it up the road a bit or round the corner a bit and so it'll only be an odd night an odd morning and I just said to him you need to get the thing stuck in the exhaust and only take it out when you're going off doing other stuff in the day
B	yeah yeah
A	because you don't wanna have a really loud
B	how much does it affect your insurance having a modified?
A	erm
B	like that I've often wondered
A	well you just have yeah you just have to tell them it's like er he's with well he's with he's with Admiral and he just has to ring and go through and all it is is you say I've got this done with it's got smaller wheels on so and it's so the speedo's all been altered to do it the right thing for the wheels so
B	right
A	you have to tell them you've done that and you have to tell them if you've lowered it and there's certain length things you can do and some things when you tell them they say well that isn't something we need to make a note of anyway
B	oh
A	mm
B	so he's still at
A	yeah
B	yeah?
A	yeah he's still there been there six years now
B	what's
A	er yeah she's erm
B	that's right
A	and she was there for about three years
B	yeah
A	er
B	did she er didn't she get a new job?
A	yeah she's at the
B	ah she's there now?
A	yeah she's er
B	how's she getting on?
A	an er examiner for a passport thing so really good cos she's not on the counter so she's not seeing people all the time
B	thank god for that
A	although occasionally she she has to go down and see somebody about something
B	good
A	erm absolutely loving what she's doing and looking er she's already I mean she's been there since March and her team leader's already said to her just to let you know there's a deputy EO position er like as in the one under her coming up she said and I want you to apply for it she said cos you've said you're looking at progressing
B	yeah
A	and I think
B	she ain't scared of work is she?
A	no no
B	that's one thing
A	no that's it and
B	she always did
A	she said she's gonna put in for that when it comes up
B	good on her
A	and er and also she says there's there's like different departments so there's a department that all specialises in fraud erm there's a department that does all the Air Force application there's a department that does all the overseas ones and she
B	that'll be interesting
A	and she said the fraud one really interests her so
B	mm
A	she said that's the sort of thing she's gonna obviously do some time doing what she's doing try and get er a deputy position and just work up but then start looking at doing something like that
B	so she don't wanna move out yet? she's quite happy at home?
A	no no
B	she's quite happy staying?
A	yeah
B	yeah with you and that
B	yeah
A	where it's
B	that's what your ideal is I think isn't it really?
A	yeah exactly
B	cos how old's
A	she was eighty this week
B	was she?
B	she don't look it does she?
A	no she doesn't
B	she's strong as an ox that one ain't she?
A	yeah oh er she's
B	she'd go on forever
A	yeah I know she's she's brilliant absolutely brilliant
B	yeah
A	but she said to me she's actually it's affected her being eighty she doesn't like being eighty cos that's a really big number and eighty you're definitely old you know she
B	did she?
A	she said she keeps saying she's thinking now that's it she's not gonna have much longer left and
B	you can't say that
A	she always used to say she always used to say oh I've had my three score and ten to her as long as you got to you got to seventy then you're on a downward spiral
A	you're going down and
B	it's all downhill from there
A	got my three score and ten
A	and she's oh oh I'm nearly eighty you know? and that was from about being seventy-one or seventy-two I'm nearly eighty you know?
B	she's like wishing it on herself
A	mm I know
B	ain't she?
A	yeah but she's actually quite like genuinely saying
B	so the fact that she'll have to have eighty
A	yeah yeah
B	she's active isn't she?
A	yeah exactly and I said to her you know you've I said if you get to the stage like when my dad for the last two or three years we knew he was getting towards the end even though it could
B	was that the funeral you had to go to?
A	no that's erm
B	oh right
A	yeah that'll be the fifth one this year
A	it's
B	what?
A	er yeah we've had a real run of just
B	oh no
A	yeah
B	have they been all at an age? or
A	no no
B	some of them young?
A	no I had er a friend at work who just who was fifty-seven just dropped down dead at home
A	erm that was the first one this year
B	oh
A	then my dad then erm
B	yeah
A	and hadn't seen for years but he then a couple of years ago started seeing a close family friend
B	right
A	so he was like in conversation again and then he he and the family friend came to my dad's funeral
B	oh
A	er something to do with a forklift not exactly sure but there's all big health and safety things going on
B	right
A	but he died on before he even left the air ambulance came but he was dead before
B	oh no
A	they didn't even take him
A	so this is the memory I'm thinking now I should know who else's funeral I've been to
B	I was gonna say there's been er
A	oh
A	yeah she had cancer that's right yeah you know
B	yes I heard about that
A	yeah so her funeral as well
B	oh sad isn't it?
A	and that was the week before the ball at
A	but she'd actually said cos she was in hospital promise me you to all of them you know you must do the ball because all the the daughters and the boyfriends and husbands all came
B	yeah
A	for it and they used to do behind the bar and do the cocktail bar and waitress for it and she made them promise that they were going to do it
B	yeah yeah
A	and then
B	sad but
A	yeah
B	you know still
A	yeah
B	celebration
A	yeah and then with
A	that you think next year it'll
B	please let it be better
A	yeah
B	you do you think that don't you? you know you
A	yeah
B	it will be
A	cos dad was so so poorly bless him and it was just
B	it's a release isn't it?
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	is your how's your mum dealing with it?
A	erm okay yeah I think
B	she's kinda getting there?
A	yeah she's she's going to erm counselling with
B	oh good
A	erm er the hospice cos they helped did hospital at home for us
B	yeah yeah
A	erm and they they only do counselling for people who have nursed people through long-term illness
B	yeah
A	so and mum said it's more a bit like a focus support group rather than actual bereavement counselling
B	right
A	but she said it's she's she's gone been about three or four times now
B	good
A	in a way it's yeah
B	that's excellent
A	yeah cos you you sort of talk about things with people and and how hard things were and funny things and she's er
B	cos you're left with a void aren't you? in your life you know
A	yeah
B	once they're gone you know
A	I spoke to her this morning and she said cos she went away a couple of
B	okay
A	erm and she went and she said
B	on her own?
A	yeah went on her own
B	good on her
A	and I went over for a day and had a day with her
B	yeah
A	erm and she said she was actually really homesick whereas before when she's been away she hasn't been but and I said it's because usually you've got part of home with you
B	mm
A	normally dad would be with you
B	mm mm
A	so you're somewhere together whereas you were actually on your own with nothing
B	yeah
A	so yeah she said she and she
A	mm
B	oh yes
A	yeah
B	oh yes
A	yeah cos I know you you lost your dad didn't you?
B	yeah I mean some
A	and that was unexpected wasn't it? so
B	I mean er they say it takes a good two years
A	mm
B	and I think mum's now it'll well it's not two years until next June but
A	yeah
B	I can only see now after a year and a half that she's starting to come out the other end
A	yeah
B	out the other side you know?
A	yeah
B	it's she's starting to but it's everything just it'll just be a song
A	yeah
B	probate
A	yes
B	all that kind of stuff
A	yeah
B	keep churning it all up again
A	yeah
B	or a letter coming through with his name on it
A	yeah
B	which you get plenty of them don't you?
A	yeah did you did you register with the thing erm to
A	there's something that well they offered it
B	yeah
A	and it's something that there's er erm Tell Us Once it's called and
B	did they? oh I didn't they didn't tell us that
A	mm they're a
B	oh
A	erm and you you sign this thing and basically it gets sent out to social service to pensions er social service er yeah social security
B	yeah
A	social service pensions it's er and it also goes to like a mailing list a place that gets put out to everybody and it takes about six weeks to come through
B	right
A	but it actually stops erm almost all of the junk mail and marketing mail and bits and stuff like that
B	cos my dad was a bit of a one for erm doing all these market research
A	oh
B	you know where you're filling out all those
A	mm
B	things and that?
A	yeah
B	and
A	yeah
B	oh I'd get so much junk
A	yeah
B	he was terrible for that
A	but does your mum just return it with deceased written on it? if you just do a return to sender with deceased that
B	I think she just chucks them away so I think she should put deceased on it
A	yeah she should do just return to sender and put deceased
B	deceased
A	yeah do that
B	right we'll do that then
A	if you look on on the net there's something about mailing preferences deceased or just something like that and there's something you can actually put the details in and it gets sent out and then a lot of the stuff will stop
B	I'll tell her then
A	yeah
B	cos I think it just does get
A	yeah
B	quite annoying really as well
A	yeah
B	and er also you know you'd ring up accounts or something
A	mm
B	and they'd go yeah yeah okay we'll take that off
A	yeah
B	next minute you'd get a letter about it
A	yeah
B	with his dear
A	yeah
B	and she'd be ringing them up and she'd say I've just rung you
A	yeah
B	and told you you know?
A	yeah
A	I know
B	mm
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	erm
B	it's
A	yeah
B	and every also there are some things you just don't understand
A	yeah
B	you know? and er it's hard
A	yeah it is
B	and your head's not in the right place
A	no
B	yeah
A	but after that I came home and I just went over pretty much every day erm and sorting things out and I did have to say after er cos I felt that I couldn't get upset and grieve because I had to be strong for mum
B	yeah I know exactly how that feels
A	so
B	yeah
A	yeah and I did actually sort of say at one point cos er we went when we were registering the death there was a point that I just got really upset and welled up and mum was actually being really business like and having a laugh and joke with the registrar
B	yeah
A	and the registrar was in training
B	yeah
A	and I had to sort of fight it all back and I actually said to mum about it I said I er I feel like I'm er I'm
B	yeah
A	erm and she said oh yeah course you can I'm not gonna be upset with that and it's just you know made it a bit easier and I more or less got to think that I was I just er er I just went home then and and mum said I can do this this and this have a few days off which I did which er and I felt quite bad about it in a way but I just I needed to be away and not being involved in
B	yes absolutely
A	yeah
B	you need to take you need to take a step away cos otherwise
A	yeah
B	it all just gets loaded on you
A	yeah
B	and just like you say you're not grieving
A	yeah
B	because I think you don't you don't wanna upset them any more by showing them your tears
A	yeah
B	but at the same time it's don't do you any good does it?
A	no no this is it so I'd be at home getting upset on
B	did she?
A	all the way through everything like my whole life and this was part of the with the counselling
B	yeah yeah
A	when I had those
B	and did you not notice it that much?
A	no
B	until the counsellor sort of said
A	no no just
B	she kinda maybe used you as a bit of more of a prop?
A	yeah
B	yeah?
A	yeah this is it and realised the whole relationship from being a baby and and all that and
B	yes
A	without making a big thing about it
B	was your sister the same or?
A	my sister? oh my sister leant on me er erm
B	did she?
A	I always
B	wonder why? are you the oldest?
A	yeah
B	and do you think that's why?
A	yeah
B	really?
A	yeah I think so mm
B	that's interesting isn't it?
A	yeah
B	because I mean so you it's like you had everything dumped on you you're like the dumping ground
A	this is it and and cos my my dad left when I was six
B	yeah
A	so it was very much then that I was the one trying to be strong and brave and er you know and obviously the way things were then when I was seven I was coming home letting the kids in from school and bringing my getting my sister from round the corner or all that sort of stuff and then we moved when I was eight to
B	so where was your mum?
A	she was working
B	she'd be working?
A	yeah
B	you'd be like literally yeah
A	yeah so er
B	doing everything else?
A	in those days you did you know? seven eight-year-old kids would be the ones who were looking after the younger kids
B	yeah
A	whereas now er it's different
B	yeah
A	and you wouldn't
B	you'd be you are actually allowed to be a child aren't you?
A	er
B	but then you were kind of seen as a bit of a
A	yeah
B	erm
A	and er I was always
B	you had to grow up quick didn't you really?
A	yeah yeah I did
B	right
A	er it went really deep with er you know this is what the counsellor helped me see
B	how many weeks did you have worth of counselling?
A	er
B	did you?
A	yeah
B	so you had a lot of stuff to get out
A	oh yeah yeah and really
B	and I suppose
A	yeah this is it er I really had to work through it all er and
B	you must've been exhausted after
A	yeah
B	every single session
A	it yeah it was really really hard and it just er but I got to a point where I actually and this is
B	oh you were just a different person
A	yeah yeah and because I had I'd found ways of making
B	and has it been better for her?
A	er mm
B	that you have been doing that?
A	er
B	yeah
A	because she's got a lot of hang-ups and a lot of problems and a lot of issues
B	mm mm hm
A	erm
B	yeah
A	and the
B	think it's manifesting in her?
A	yeah
B	and it's sort of
A	yeah
B	not making the ME any better isn't it?
A	yeah
B	mm
A	try and I said I've been saying to her for years that she needed to go even if just to let everything out
B	yeah
A	she needs to go she's got so much stuff that she's carrying around and it makes her
B	yeah yeah
A	you know? but she won't
B	so she could be set free as well couldn't she?
A	yeah but she won't she's er even when I've spoken to her about it and
B	do you think she doesn't wanna deal with it?
A	yeah I think so and er and I think in a way the way she is she almost likes being who she is being manipulative being
B	right
A	poor little me
B	I get you
A	being
B	bit of a victim in a way
A	yeah exactly and
B	yeah
A	and I think she likes she quite likes being the person she is she's so controlling
B	mm mm
A	that actually if she had the counselling she might let some stuff out and then not need to be so controlling
B	I see
A	and cos she's so controlling she likes to be controlling for herself and for other people
B	yeah
A	and
B	yeah
A	so yeah it's it's it's a erm big mess that needs sorting but I don't think she will I don't think she will
B	she's a fool to herself
A	yeah oh yeah yeah
B	but like you say if she doesn't wanna change
A	yeah this is it erm
B	does she?
A	and I'd got so I wouldn't play the game with her any more and I wouldn't do that and it was it was amazing and then obviously with dad being ill it it was it er changed things a bit er but then with him obviously once he died it she I
B	mm
A	and I had to really stop er
B	to
A	yeah yeah
B	could you feel yourself kinda getting pulled back in?
A	yeah exactly and it's hard now
B	yeah
A	because obviously I'm all over the place I'm vulnerable so it'd be quite easy for us to go right back into that really destructive relationship and I'm not really strong enough in a way to stop it happening but I'm really trying and that's probably making me less tolerant because I'm less
B	yeah
A	tolerant and er yeah it is er really hard
B	it's probably a good thing she isn't coming up
A	yeah
B	isn't it?
A	yeah
B	it probably did you a favour there didn't she?
A	yeah I think so because er I've just I was just thinking oh I just yeah
B	you'll cope without her there
A	oh yeah I know I will cos I'm I you know I do I can get on with stuff and I'll be alright and like I say I've got a really good network of people that will help me
A	yeah
B	haven't you?
A	yeah exactly
B	yeah well definitely I wouldn't doubt that at all
A	yeah
B	she sounds like she doesn't mind her own company
A	no no no she well she did seriously
B	is she?
A	yeah and she could quite easily like have that lifestyle and
B	yeah
A	er just go off and be in a retreat somewhere
B	solitude
A	and I could see her being like that and just being that's just totally all er all sort of consuming
B	mm self
A	just religion and the self and yeah and and she would actually then not be so controlling she could just be herself and
B	mm mm
A	go and do it
B	yeah
A	and I could see her there I could I could see her being there
B	wow
A	mm
B	it's good that she's got a faith I suppose because
A	yeah
B	gives people direction doesn't it?
A	yeah she's er
B	something to
A	very very strong faith and she starts every morning with her quiet time as she calls it so she gets up and I think she has er like a green tea or something or and then she goes and sits and she just prays and she's got a couple of books with erm
B	yeah
A	but just writings and things and thought and and she just sits and maybe reads a bit of the Bible and then
B	wow
A	yeah
B	are you religious then?
A	no
B	no no
A	no
B	yeah I think so
A	I don't know how whether it's scientific or religious or you know whatever
B	it's how you
A	yeah
B	I think I
A	yeah
B	but I believe there's a higher self you know
A	yeah
A	and whether it's your consciousness or whether it's
B	yeah
A	overall or yeah
B	oh yeah
A	somehow and you know
B	there's some kind of
A	so yeah
B	oh yeah
A	and and definitely erm
B	well it's just things they start doing when I mean we've had some quite freaky little instances since you know cos it takes them a while
A	yeah
B	they reckon to come back through but
A	yes
A	mm
B	things like tellies
A	yeah
B	telly turning itself on and off
A	yeah
B	you know? things like
A	yeah
B	we'd be talking about my dad the next minute the telly'd come on
A	yeah
B	weird
A	oh wow that's yeah er er that's nice though
B	I don't know if you've had anything like that have you?
A	no no no not that sort of stuff
B	yeah
A	but I haven't felt more like that but with sometimes you can just sense there's a presence there's somebody there
B	you can
A	yeah
B	it's er odd isn't it? it's hard to describe because
A	mm
B	you do
A	mm yeah yeah
B	yeah
A	you know when you read hear people
B	comforting
A	you know when you when you
B	did they?
A	this went on
B	yeah
A	or fell in I dunno
B	fell in
A	yeah
B	she was trying to tell people
A	yeah she was
B	that she was there
A	I'm there help me I'm
B	so could rest
A	yeah yeah exactly and
B	crikey
A	you know I think it's fascinating
B	I believe in it completely I do
A	yeah yeah
B	I'm a
A	mm
B	yeah
A	the other thing's when more when I was a kid more erm
B	they say you're more
A	perceptive
B	when you're younger
A	yeah
B	don't they?
A	yeah I had this one night I I was laying in bed and I sort of I
B	did you?
A	never any sort of scariness or anything like that but I know there was nobody there but
B	do you
A	yeah there'd be nobody there but I could feel the end of the bed just er cos obviously you don't fill the full bed when you're a kid
B	yeah
A	the weight of somebody on the end of the bed
B	yeah
A	and then I always think oh maybe I'm imagining it and then a bit later I would feel you could actively feel it go up as they got off
B	oh come to see you?
A	yeah exactly yeah and then one night I kept seeing blue flashing lights blue flashing lights and and I'd think er oh
B	oh
A	and I kept looking and er and it was the night my great gran died
B	no?
A	yeah and she was in a nursing home and she passed away in her sleep so there were no sirens or flashing
B	how strange
A	yeah
B	like a
A	yeah yeah it was something really really really strange
B	huh
A	yeah I know
B	like you hear sometimes of people erm
A	yeah yeah
B	to say that you know to say to say come to say goodbye
A	yeah
B	it was er
A	mm
B	just awful
A	yeah
B	I'll never forget that
A	yeah
B	dunno how my mum did it I really don't
A	no I don't my mum said in a way because he'd been so poorly and because I mean they were having carers in a couple of times a day
B	yeah
A	erm for the last so many months erm and
B	yeah
A	and she said a few times I'm not thinking about him as he was in the years before that because I can't cope with the thought of losing that person yet
B	yes
A	but the person that's been so ill I can come to terms with the fact that he's now gone and he's in a better place
B	yeah
A	and because he was very
B	was he?
A	yeah so for her
B	to calm down?
A	yeah and he'd calm down and and er
B	would he?
A	he was actually when I was singing Lord of All Hopefulness and he started going he started
B	wow
A	and er I this the week was such a lovely week with him
B	yeah
A	although we knew it was the last few days or week or whatever and there was so much medical stuff going on but you we had some really lovely connecting times with him just there and and mum and I were there all the time and it was just it it was lovely it was it was a really special week and all my sisters say that because they were there they were there in the day as well and like my stepbrother and my brother
B	yeah
A	they both came up and saw him but they didn't stay so er it
B	so you can treasure that
A	yeah
B	memories can't you?
A	definitely definitely yeah yeah
B	those things you can keep close to your heart can't you?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	and singing and singing and after a little
B	did he? did he? I don't want this any more
B	oh bless his heart
A	oh it was yeah
[ANNOTATION]	person A is talking about singing	Entailment
B	oh sweet
A	but then he was alright and he he rallied again and then yeah they started putting like the morphine patches and things on so we knew again that was er you know he was getting to the last couple of days and
B	so you were all there when he passed?
A	we were all there when yeah when he passed we were all there erm
A	mm
B	like you say he's isn't there it's lovely when you can actually
A	yeah
B	can't you?
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about weather	Contradiction
A	mm well we er
B	that's good
B	he'll hear
A	yeah
B	oh
A	and she said sometimes we go in houses and everyone's so sad and they're crying
B	yeah
A	other houses we go in it's just chaos other ones we go in they're arguing and she said but whatever your normal home is that's what is good for him to hear
B	that's great
A	yeah
B	cos that's where he'd feel comfort
A	yeah
B	they must see so much mustn't they?
A	yeah oh er the palliative care is just
B	special kind of person
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about book	Contradiction
A	yeah absolutely unbelievable they were they were incredible they just come in and they say right er we're gonna come and reassess and we'll see what needs doing and we'll keep you in touch and er these are the numbers you need to ring and this is what you need to do and they just take over everything and we suddenly had like four times a day two carers coming in erm and
B	so really really helpful
A	er you just everything's taken off you
B	that's fantastic
[ANNOTATION]	person B like that	Neutral
A	yeah so you just be there with them keep each other going keep him going spend time
A	absolutely unbelievable
B	couldn't do it without them could you?
A	no
B	no way
A	somebody actually decided er obviously er for a funeral you raise money don't you? for one and donations
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about a film	Contradiction
B	yeah so you didn't have flowers? just er donations?
A	yeah and just did family flowers what we actually did was erm mum did a spray and then the children we all cos there's seven kids between them
B	yeah
A	erm we just did one nice big spray and then we all wrote a card individually that we put into the spray
B	yeah
A	so it was one lot of flowers from all the kids
B	lovely
A	with separate messages from us all so
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about weather	Contradiction
B	so where was he was he buried or?
A	no he was cremated
B	right
A	erm and cos the Methodist Church we did they do the cremation first
B	yeah
A	and then you go to the
B	oh okay that sounds nice
A	so yeah so it was family only up at the crematorium and then we went to the the celebration of life
B	right
A	yeah
B	oh
A	and we
B	right
A	erm and we actually so this is donations at the funeral and then we did er they
B	oh
A	she
B	yeah
A	we'll do that shall we do that? and
A	and they were like oh why not?
B	good
A	cos my sister was over from Canada as well for the funeral and it was the week after that so
B	so you all did it?
A	yeah we did this all dressed up in onesies with sort of sparkly glowsticks and things and
B	great did you make much money?
A	yeah we did we did about a thousand pound
B	good
A	with that yeah and then with the donations at the funeral we did about another thousand so we had about a thousand going to each
B	oh that's brilliant
A	so yeah we were and and we were so pleased
B	overwhelmed
A	and that basically would've paid for some like er you know certain things for somebody else and you think yeah
B	give someone else the chance
A	yeah
B	to have the comfort
A	yeah
B	in the care
A	exactly
B	in the days of their life I suppose
A	yeah exactly
B	giving something back to them
A	yeah
B	after what they've helped with you
A	exactly
B	and him yeah
A	yeah yeah
B	did they?
A	so yeah cos er he er my dad was such er such a lovely man
B	yeah
A	that the
B	that's beautiful
A	yeah and er so a few of them came to the funeral as well and it was just yeah
B	just to pay their respects?
A	yeah
B	I bet that pleased your mum as well
A	yeah yeah it was nice
B	how do your feet feel now?
A	mm they feel lovely mm
B	we'll do some erm
A	yeah
B	so do some visualisation
A	okay
B	with the colours
A	yeah
B	and erm what I want you to do
A	right
B	and visualise yourself and that colour going to that part of the body
A	yeah
B	okay so
A	yeah
B	so if you think of
A	okay
B	so visualise that colour
A	mm
B	going down into the feet
A	mm
B	bright red colour
A	wow just goose pimples all up and down all over
B	it's funny isn't it?
A	yeah
B	it's lovely
A	yeah all tingly
B	and also another good one is is tree roots
A	mm
B	growing out of your feet
A	yeah
B	planting themself into the ground grounding you into the
A	that's a nice idea
B	into the earth
A	mm
B	okay so the next one were gonna do is orange
A	mm
B	and the next colour we're gonna do is yellow so if you think of a big red
A	mm
B	into your stomach area
A	mm
B	and it really really helps
A	yeah good
B	how do you find that breathing?
A	yeah it's er
B	yeah? I always hold my
A	mm
B	just around the solar plexus area
A	yeah
B	and then just
A	yeah
B	so just let it go down really really slowly
A	mm
B	and I find I used to just go off and just do it practise it three times a day
A	yeah
B	and I used to just go off somewhere quiet and do it
A	yeah
B	and then I got to the point where got so much better at it that if I found myself getting anxious or stressed
A	mm
B	in any situation then I would I could just do it
A	you'd just do it
B	without even thinking about it
A	yeah
B	it'll just come
A	er that's a really good idea
B	really good and it's
A	yeah
B	and it does work
A	yeah
B	and you find that all those little anxieties that you were having before you're not getting
A	right
B	and
A	yeah
B	because it is actually working
A	it gets you into a state of wellbeing as such yeah
B	does really work
A	yeah
B	I went to see er
A	right
B	and erm basically instead of just obviously talking about problems it was giving me
A	mm hm
B	so because I was getting so anxious I got to the point where I was hyperventilating and things like that
A	yeah
B	she gave me these techniques to do
A	yeah
B	and to visualise certain things to help me
A	oh that's really good
B	absolutely amazing
A	yeah
B	really really good so definitely do the breathing
A	yeah
B	you'll find it works
A	no I will do yeah yeah
B	and a lot up to practising three times a day up to the erm operation
A	yeah I will do yeah I will get a good
B	it'll really help you to get in a good head space
A	yeah yeah no that's that's a really good idea
B	really will
A	yeah
B	I think so
A	mm
B	so we'll sit you up give you some water
A	yeah
B	and just talk about what we found
A	okay mm
B	in your feet
A	er
B	I
B	did it peel off or something? did it have the same colour?
A	no no no I erm thank you
B	I like it it's pastel
A	so yeah it's a blue yeah it's like a blue colour
B	yeah
A	rather than the green that I've got on at the minute
B	I like the green though
A	I thought yeah I do I'm into all like the blues turquoises and all that at the moment and I
B	yeah
A	oh I wanna see what it looks like er
B	it's nice on your fingers though
A	yeah
B	doesn't it?
A	yeah
B	I like that cos I like green anyway
B	be be in blue
B	brilliant look at that
A	yeah I do like my nail varnish
B	you've got such good feet
A	yeah
B	so lucky
A	yeah
B	so did you feel any pain in them at all? where I was working or any pressure or?
A	erm
B	yeah
A	I I got like shooting pains in that a bit
B	I've found it on both here
A	mm yeah
B	and across the top
A	yeah
B	really crunchy
A	yeah
B	now to me that's brain
A	yeah
B	but sometimes erm sorry yeah this one
A	yeah
B	erm oh they are so crunchy
A	yeah
B	but that's ear's here
A	right
B	but the top is brain
A	right
B	so sometimes it can be if you're on medication
A	yeah
B	it can sometimes pick up
A	er would that be stress or?
B	it can be stress
A	yeah
B	headaches
A	yeah
B	tension
A	mm
B	tension headaches
A	mm
B	that kind of thing
A	yes I haven't been getting
B	so maybe it's tension
A	yeah
B	that's all I can put it down to
A	yeah
B	erm
A	mm hm
A	yeah I've had a cold into a sore throat which is
B	ah
A	just about on the end of it so yeah
B	so that's
A	yeah
B	coming up to the end of it then so that
A	yeah
B	might be why sinuses were a little bit
A	yeah
B	they weren't too bad to be fair
A	no
B	erm
A	and that one was a bit tender on the end that the second
B	that one there?
A	yeah the second toe just a bit
B	there so that's sinuses
A	mm
B	in there
A	yeah
B	that could be a little bit erm bunged up
A	yeah
B	erm
A	did you?
B	were quite yeah
A	oh right
B	they were quite erm crunchy
A	yeah
B	so unless it could be because you're maybe digesting your breakfast?
A	or it could be the pain that I've got all the time that I'm having the hysterectomy for is actually my bowels that could be interesting
B	ah
A	feels like a permanent bruise pushing down
B	really?
A	yeah yeah
B	so that's what I was cos obviously all round here is where it's groin
A	yeah
B	and
A	yeah
B	and things like that so pelvis
A	mm yeah
A	yeah
B	so that's why then I was picking that up
A	mm
B	erm cos I could feel a little bit in the uterus
A	yeah
B	like it it's there
A	yeah
B	but then that's also round sort of pelvis area too
A	yeah
B	little bit in the ovaries
A	yeah and the ovaries are are fine
B	fallopian tubes seem to be okay
A	yeah
B	erm
A	yeah
B	so they're not too bad erm
A	yeah
B	but
B	you've always you've had neck problems
A	yeah yeah
B	erm
A	mm
B	this one especially was really tight in there
A	yeah
B	erm
A	mm
B	so is that everything would you say?
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	yeah? more or less?
A	yeah yeah
B	good
A	yeah
B	ah
A	mm
B	cos I have obviously done erm quite a firm treatment and
A	yeah
B	if you don't urinate any of these toxins which obviously I've pushed back up
A	yeah
B	into the body again and they're swimming all around
A	yeah
B	you will you can or will have a crashing headache
A	yeah no that's right
B	and it's not pleasant
A	er I always drink loads of water anyway so
[ANNOTATION]	A usually avoids drinking water and has beer instead.	Contradiction
B	great stuff
A	yeah it's yeah
B	so you can do that erm
A	mm
B	I don't know if you're drinking much caffeine at the moment are you?
A	usually have one a day
B	yeah that's fine then
B	so you know if you can drink fruit tea
A	got a nice coffee machine so I just do that
B	that's fine then
A	and I have herbal teas and then just loads of water
B	great so try and drink those for the rest of the day then
A	yeah I will do
B	cos obviously they're not erm don't contain any caffeine
A	yeah
B	erm
[ANNOTATION]	They got into tea when they met their partner.	Neutral
A	yeah
B	so I sometimes find people can come away feeling quite uplifted afterwards
A	mm
B	or most of the time people come away feeling really relaxed
[ANNOTATION]	Herbal teas usually don't make people tense.	Entailment
A	yeah
B	but just go with the flow
A	yeah that's right
B	erm I think your body will take from it whatever it needs to
A	mm
B	erm so yeah just try and
[ANNOTATION]	B got their coffee machine from their ex-wife.	Neutral
A	mm
B	just try and relax and
A	yeah I will do
B	practise your breathing techniques
A	yes
B	and see how you go with them
A	this is the memory I I've totally forgotten about the breathing now er
A	literally and it's like
B	it's mad isn't it?
[ANNOTATION]	B learnt some breathing techniques from a guru.	Neutral
A	er it's just it's wiped absolutely ridiculous
B	isn't it it's funny
A	I've got a whiteboard at home and I'm literally I write everything on that that I need to do
B	do you?
A	yeah if
B	write it on your
A	write it on the board
B	breathing techniques
[ANNOTATION]	A has a blackboard where they write inspirational quotes.	Contradiction
A	yeah I will
B	three times a day
A	yeah yeah I will
B	okay?
A	yeah in fact I'll write it on something

B	so does
A	she doesn't work now cos her back's really bad so
B	so you can just call her up
A	yeah
B	and say could you just
A	yeah
B	come and
A	and she she's just been erm told they're referring her for a hysterectomy as well so yeah
B	I had heard something that one of my customers was telling me cos she
A	mm
B	but apparently if they
A	oh yeah they
B	to not have them any more
A	they
B	yeah
A	years and years ago and now they then they
B	you have to have it done in your case
A	yeah and cos I I've I've got this permanent pain which and what they think it is is the the fibroids are
B	right
A	and cos I'm getting problems with my back the it's just it's on something and I've got this permanent like a bruise that someone's got a thumb pushing on it just pushing pushing pushing and that's why when you said about the thing with the bowel
B	yeah
A	I'm thinking oh god please don't let it be a problem with that instead of but
B	but I suppose he'll they'll go in and they'll
A	yeah
B	it could be attaching itself to something
A	yeah
B	you just don't know do you?
A	this it it could be yeah we're not sure exactly so she's gonna have a look around when she's in there and
B	yeah is it a female is it?
A	well
B	surgeon
A	er my consultant's er a female
B	yeah
A	Miss
B	right
A	I should find out I think when I have my pre-op but
B	yeah
A	er I don't know who's doing it I don't care but
B	are you going up to erm
A	yeah just the women and children's bit in there so
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	take it out
A	yeah
B	cos I know some women they're find it a bit difficult
A	mm
B	to cope with the fact that they're having their lady bits taken away
A	yeah
B	I don't know how you feel about that but
A	no not er
B	the hassle you've had with it
A	the yeah the they've done their job I've got two amazing children and that was what it's there for
B	yeah
A	you know
B	yeah
A	and well er I mean whether I'll
B	were you quite young when you had both of them anyway?
A	erm twenty-four twenty-five
B	mm
A	yeah no no and er
B	you never had a problem then?
A	no second time I got pregnant as soon as we decided to try for the second one I never came on again that I got straight away so it's they've done exactly what they needed
B	mm
A	two years ago I started having really heavy periods and that's when they did the microwave erm
B	oh the
A	they took the lining of the lomb of the womb away
B	I think I remember you going in for that
A	yeah that's when I was at
B	yeah
A	yeah they took that did took that away so I never had any periods since then so and it's never given me any problem until this about a year ago I just started getting this pain and my stomach getting bigger and the stomach getting bigger and bigger and this pain
B	mm hm
A	and that's why you know they they think they think it should hopefully sort it out
B	good
A	so
B	see women's problems
A	I know
B	hormones who needs them eh?
A	I er yeah I
B	need them though don't we?
A	yeah mm
B	this is the trouble
A	mm
B	can't do without them
A	ah
A	oh right
B	and hopefully should feel like you're walking on air
A	ah yes
B	yeah something nice and soft
A	oh
A	yeah thank you
B	don't want anyone disturbing you
A	no exactly not in my me time
A	oh that was so nice
B	did you enjoy it?
A	really did yeah really nice
B	cos I enjoy doing it as well
A	yeah
B	it just a bit a bit more holistic
A	yeah yeah that's it
B	someone asked me to do a reiki treatment the other day she said
A	mm
B	she said do you think you could do it? I said well yeah it's just it's just confidence
A	yeah
B	that's all
A	yeah
B	I used to do a lot of it but I just
A	cos
B	reiki's erm again it's like it works on the same principles as reflexology really you're helping to erm
A	mm
B	so placing you can either place your hands on the recipient directly or you can just raise them above
A	oh right
B	and erm
A	I get the heat er
B	do you?
A	yeah
B	you see I think people
A	people that talking about healing my er my hands tingle and heat comes out
B	that's it
A	and I've got it with people I've had problem they've had problems with their back or problems and
B	got the gift love
A	yeah I've got it but I've never done anything with it but yeah
B	I tell you what I think er it I mean it's I think if anyone has the intent to do something
A	yeah
B	they can deliver it but
A	mm
B	you know just the feel of the heat and when you
A	it's like my hand's now it's going
B	meet somebody and you connect
A	yeah
B	and the feeling
A	yeah
B	that you get through you know the
A	yes
B	it's er wonderful
A	yeah
B	it's like somebody's just come and given you a big hug
A	yeah
B	I find
A	yeah yeah
B	wow
A	it is
B	so you could do reiki
A	I could do yeah
B	you don't want to do it maybe do the reiki one and two
A	yeah could do
B	you can send healing to people then
A	yeah
B	I would
B	I don't know who does it now I mean I did it through er with my reflexology tutor when I was at college
A	mm
B	we did it with her and then I went on to do my erm level my masters but
A	yeah
B	it finds you
A	yeah
B	and I think that you do you go through a little bit of a mental clear-out
A	yeah
B	in your life when you do it
A	yeah
B	cos I did
A	yeah
B	and it was amazing
A	yeah
B	got rid of all the rubbish I didn't need in my life any more
A	ah that's good well I
B	yeah I er
A	you're looking like
B	I feel I don't feel tired I feel very good in myself
A	yeah
B	but I just wish I didn't have bags under my eyes all the time but
A	no no
B	he still he's
A	no
B	he's not a bad sleeper but so I'm not getting
A	yeah with with broken sleep that does make a difference doesn't it?
B	you just keep going don't you?
A	yeah
B	you know you get used to it
A	yeah yeah
B	but erm
A	mm
B	he maybe he's done it
A	yeah yeah
B	so but
A	you don't you look fine you look you look really you look relaxed and
B	but I I think I've got my figure back
A	yeah
B	yeah yeah
A	yeah yeah well I was just meaning your face though cos er for me I don't look at body shapes and sizes
B	yeah
B	that's good then
A	yeah you
B	yeah I feel it
A	your skin looks good and you're just
B	I feel I think cos of er you know
A	your expression on your face is nice and
B	you you
A	oh yeah
B	I mean it has been a good summer and erm er I expect this time of year it does to slow down a little bit
A	yeah
B	but it's just making sure you get the word out there really isn't it?
A	yeah this is it
B	and it's word of mouth isn't it?
A	well it's like you say start to slow down but I still I can never seem to get er like
B	no last week
A	and then next week now you're fully booked
B	yeah
A	and
B	I mean I
A	yeah
B	I work every evening
A	yeah
B	as well so they're always full
A	mm
B	evenings tend to go first
A	yeah
B	so
A	have you got somebody else that's here with you now as well though? did you cos you were looking for someone
B	I was looking for someone yeah
A	yeah cos I shared it didn't I? but
B	never have never found anyone
A	yeah I find that with
B	I interviewed two or three but
B	yeah
A	they've built er like an extension end and a bit more in there
B	oh have they?
A	yeah did that a little while ago and they've got er a spare room which
B	yeah
A	and they've got a nail room so
B	she went
A	so got the the hairdressing and that but there's a room
B	so they can't find anyone either?
A	no no it's and every now and then they sort of go oh there's you know there's a room available but
B	it's so hard to find somebody
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	whereas you want people to come and bring the custom and build the client base and they
B	you do they don't wanna do it
A	you know you rent the room you rent yeah
B	they don't wanna put the hard work in
A	no no this is it
B	half of the time
A	no
B	or you find that you get somebody who's doing a bit of mobile and isn't prepared to give you part of the
A	yeah
B	they wanna come in they wanna use your grounds
A	yeah
B	they wanna use your stuff
A	yeah
B	but they don't wanna pay you any money towards it
A	no
B	and you're looking at at least fifty fifty for that
A	yeah oh yeah
B	cos
A	yeah well exactly
B	stock
A	yeah
B	costs a fortune
A	yeah
B	but they
A	mm
B	I don't think so
A	no no
A	no
B	I've interviewed three people but again they've got no one to bring with them which would be handy
A	yeah
B	because if you're starting from scratch you
A	and you don't wanna be giving them your customers and it's not you know
B	this is it
A	and er the thing is even if you're fully booked you don't want to start saying oh well go to the other person cos then they might stay with them
B	won't come back
A	and then you don't get them back yeah
B	yeah
A	exactly and then they might leave and take half your customers
B	yeah so you could end up you know doing yourself
A	mm
B	a bit of a
A	yeah disservice
B	yeah
A	yeah yeah
B	you you don't know who you can trust do you? these days
A	no no that's it
B	so
A	mm
B	maybe sometimes I think to myself well should I just stay as I am? cos I only end up paying more tax that way
A	yeah
B	shall I just stay as I am? but if the right person comes along then
A	mm
B	just gonna wait and see
A	yeah
B	I'm not gonna do too much about it at the moment while it's you know
A	no
B	this time of year so
A	yeah no that's it
B	we'll see
A	yeah yeah this is it the thing is people tend to come along at the right time don't they?
B	yeah
B	I'm gonna keep putting it out there to the universe as I
A	yeah
B	say I keep going please please
A	yeah
B	bring me somebody who's
A	well that's it well whenever you put it on Facebook I'll just share it for you
