B	I used to uh like to listen to classical music uh
A	what?
B	um I used to like listening to classical and world and jazz and weird music under it's like a is that a
A	oh yeah it's in like a the number three's in like a alto
B	but if the  if the  bottom bit uh goes then it that's like a
A	that's an
B	if you
A	yeah
B	no this is Radio Three man
A	just silence?
B	yeah
A	I know
B	probably yeah probably don't wanna put it really high in case it sort of blasts at you
A	no cos then next time it'll be
B	but we we could leave it on uh Three for a bit yeah cos it's sort of
A	what does Nightwaves mean?
[ANNOTATION]	Speakers will not listen to the Radio Three the whole day.	Entailment
B	uh
A	but the thing is I'll forget and I'll have turned this up really loud and then it'll be like duh duh
B	uh it's it's radio isn't it so
A	well
B	um because
A	he sounded okay but I wasn't convinced he was really German
B	no
A	maybe he is maybe that's really insulting
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A wasn't sure the speaker was French.	Contradiction
B	no I think he was German um
A	his accent was funny but then again I suppose like if he's been living in different places
B	oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	no
B	uh for different um
A	different kind of reading of the word funny
B	well no yeah
A	but like nothing's happening
B	oh it will
A	like if you were trying to tune into Radio Three like how would you even find it
B	how d'you
A	oh you mean like crrrrr? Yeah?
B	hisses but when you get Three when you hear nothing then you know
A	yeah
B	it's a channel that spends a lot of time doing nothing you know what I mean?
A	I was thinking of getting like
B	but Three they they got massive
[ANNOTATION]	Three Radio transmits on 98.5 Hz.	Neutral
A	have they? Did I tell you I was looking at like buying a um um a wind-up solar powered radio that's also a torch that's also a USB charger?
B	oh
A	thought it sounded pretty fantastic
B	um
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A didn't want a solar radio.	Contradiction
A	you can get digital ones but they're quite expensive
B	no no I don't want digital radio that's uh
A	oh
B	uh the um tuny ones are better than digital ones
A	are they?
[ANNOTATION]	The digital radios are not better than the tuny radios.	Entailment
B	Cos you get more precision
A	do you?
B	yeah
A	what?
B	you type in the frequency
A	um
B	that's not the same as digital
A	no
B	transmission
[ANNOTATION]	the two speakers are talking about fine tuning something	Entailment
A	no you
B	I didn't expect it to be uh
A	no you can get them
B	yeah no I just meant um
A	I dunno
B	um
A	ah right
B	uh yeah it was nowhere near as good cos it didn't have the the like the the precise um ability to change
A	yeah
A	oh
A	the most what?
B	I guess it's sort of
A	I dunno I mean it depends what you think of hig-brow is like
B	whereas Radio One is the  is the  most hip and then Radio Two is like yeah for sort of middle aged people um
[ANNOTATION]	The two speakers are discussing Radio One and Two.	Entailment
A	for like
B	uh
A	Terry Wogan-y
B	uh
A	it's just sort of
B	yeah Three's I think it's quite highbrow but it's
A	it's more like discussions and stuff though isn't it like?
B	yeah talking yeah
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Radio Three is the most popular in Australia.	Neutral
B	yeah so we we'll put it on then uh you know since we've been talking about it uh
[ANNOTATION]	Terry Wogan likes cupcakes more than birthday cake.	Neutral
A	four?
B	yeah
A	yeah I think so
B	yeah
A	the emergence of geology as a scientific discipline
B	um
A	aw that sounds awful
B	no it's it's
A	I don't like him
B	he annoys me most when he talks about religion but now he's like
A	no no no he annoys me most when talks about class
[ANNOTATION]	The two speakers get annoyed by religion and class.	Entailment
B	oh yeah
A	he was saying about how class isn't defined by like your socio-economic situation it's defined by what you like
B	well
A	like some people like opera
B	so like the Queen and like a tramp
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	The Queen is dead.	Contradiction
B	could be in the same class
A	if they both like horse racing yeah
B	or something
B	or um
A	I don't know if it's I maybe
B	well
A	so
B	if he's talking about the the old classes but I mean working class uh
A	well
B	there are clearly
A	yeah
B	like if you're in the sort of uh in the urban uh urban sort of inner city then then that's gonna be that's a certain kind of class isn't it and then if you're in sort of a
A	yeah I mean
B	but yeah it's it's cultures yeah I mean
A	well
B	like you were saying he said something it's just  it's just  a sensational thing to say
A	decaying?
A	sorry I was thinking about like their teeth or something
B	no uh
A	yeah
B	or I mean the the the cities the urban city poor have things in common I suppose like
A	yeah
B	if you're from the inner city of Birmingham or Nottingham or Leicester or London then you probably have things in common
A	yeah
B	but I guess what what he would what he's trying to say is that people with the same amount of money have different cultures and not part of a single class but then I don't know if there ever if it was ever that simple anyway
A	no I don't think it was I think he's
B	yeah
A	I read a really interesting um interview with him where like reviewer was like just picking holes at him like saying Hey but you said this
B	oh um I think you might have uh might have showed me
A	yeah
B	clearly there are rich people there's an elite
A	alright Trenton
A	trenton
B	so he I mean now now we can't
A	doesn't matter I was only teasing
B	uh
A	yeah
B	then there's  then there's  sort of medium
A	well I don't know
B	and you know it's not that easy to get from one you know from a tramp to the global super rich
A	well I know people are born into different
B	because you you
A	no I know I know
B	and you don't have the money uh at your disposal you know to to just  to just  afford to make mistakes you know
A	but
B	if you're rich you you make a few mistakes and you get a maybe you get a
A	yeah
B	crash a car or something you know
A	yeah
B	you get bailed
A	yeah
B	uh
B	if you haven't got money obviously then you know I mean everybody uh has a life in which to make something of it but if you're in a different class that's gonna make it a lot harder or easier depending on what class you're in
A	yeah it is but I think you should
B	it doesn't matter where you're born?
A	I well I
B	it shouldn't but it does though doesn't it?
[ANNOTATION]	Where someone is born plays its part we like it or not.	Entailment
A	well yes perhaps but I don't think you should be like um embarrassed about it or I think
B	shouldn't be embarrassed no you shouldn't have to be embarrassed
A	but I think
B	no or you shouldn't  you shouldn't  be embarrassed but
A	no I'm not saying  I'm not saying  elitism doesn't exist
B	um
A	I'm I'm sure it certainly does but
B	I guess in in that strong sense it would mean choosing between people based on their background or or connections um
A	but I think you know you've just gotta
B	so it's related to nepotism I suppose isn't it a bit?
A	but you've gotta do your best to to do to get what you you can to do what you can do I think
[ANNOTATION]	Poor people usually feel neglected.	Neutral
B	well no no
A	mm
B	we we saw the yeah we saw uh the the debate yesterday which wasn't a very on um
A	with Billy Bragg?
B	on Ten O'clock Live wasn't it?
A	yeah
B	but it wasn't
[ANNOTATION]	The debate was on air after 8 o'clock.	Entailment
A	yeah
B	um yeah so you get the
A	I do like a bit of Billy Bragg
B	on the other hand you know then I mean the Eton guy was nice because I mean that's what  that's what  you pay the you know eleven grand a term for or whatever
A	is that how much it is?
B	uh no I don't know how much it is but uh I
A	it's a lot of money innit?
B	but
A	I dunno though
B	you're
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah cos I'm not
B	yeah but this what it's all about so like I think it's about uh connections
A	what everybody else in the whole world's doing like
B	but um
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A doesn't despise Billy Bragg.	Entailment
A	maybe I'm just not like a
B	yeah I mean I suppose you don't want like a massive amount do you? You're not
A	well
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B thinks speaker A wants a lot of something.	Contradiction
B	that's that's not meant to to be insulting cos I don't  I don't  know if I wanna be any of those either
A	no I'm not insulted
B	uh yeah
A	I've got no  I've got no  like I don't wanna be the head of the company that I work for or the the king of the world or anything like that no I mean
B	well
A	yeah of course they do but I suppose I just don't really  don't really  fancy that
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A feels offended by speaker's B words.	Contradiction
B	I think about elitism um it it basically means you you're but you're not you're you're some unfairness is going on
A	I know favouring people from a certain
B	that's that's what I'm talking about so
A	well I'm not
B	I mean yeah well
A	well
B	uh you'd have to change the  you'd have to change the  definition I mean and you'd have to sort of say it's not about unfairness it's about
A	alright smarty pants
B	it's you know you can't prevent a rich person from from living their life in its full glory of richness
A	well they should if they want to
B	you know cos that would be unfair but on the other hand you know their life
A	yeah
B	he so often complained about the snobbery
A	yeah? That's what he said he opened it for
B	no
A	yeah
B	rhetoric from him
A	mhm
B	and also of uh of um of the BBC as well he he's always hated the BBC
A	yeah
B	uh and he's claimed to have hated the you know the sort of posh uh
A	yeah
B	english people who dominated the BBC in the olden days
A	Fleet Street and stuff
B	uh the Old Boys and everything
A	are you sticking up for Rupert Murdoch? Cos that's massively out of character move for for you
B	well
A	yeah
B	um
A	mhm
B	uh
A	you have to be a bully yourself yeah
B	yeah
A	public schoolboy rowers are they I mean? I mean I know it wasn't a target it wasn't targeted at those rowers it was targeted at Oxford and Cambridge but um
B	uh no no well it was said that uh that they only used to take from um from uh private schools but they've expanded now anyway I mean I'm sure they take a substantial percentage of uh
A	yeah
B	but it was pointed out uh I think it was John Prescott mentioned some some percentage about you know the the private schools produces a a very high percentage of uh
A	mm
B	you know so it's more about
A	yeah
B	but at um
A	yeah
B	uh elitism because before you've gone to private school you may well not have shown that level of uh skill
A	but I think the problem is in the
B	uh some people do
A	yeah
B	um
A	being ruffians?
B	but also if you  if you
A	end up down the park drinking cider?
B	if you're from a  if you're from a  successful family
A	yeah
B	then uh you you you want your child children to be um successful so um that that would mean you'd wanna go to a successful school where the majority of them you have to pay full but but um
A	yeah
B	I don't think they really discussed the sort of like the the hardest the the sort of strongest arguments about it like
A	yeah
B	so they the the the answers are uh uh
A	I dunno I just think
B	no but the
A	yeah
B	using scholarships
A	yeah yeah
B	so you would want more scholarships there at that entry point at that age eleven entry point or whatever
A	yeah
B	but if you're saying that that doesn't matter uh we'll we'll we'll just forget we'll forget the school bit we'll just go from the age sixteen or age eighteen entry point and then  and then  say so we could improve all the schools as well yeah
A	I dunno because I just think like
B	right
A	you've gotta want to do it haven't you?
B	um
A	if you're a kid
B	oh yeah but um you'll come out of it with  you'll come out of it with  like that that on your
A	if you're a hard working kid
B	but uh if
A	mm
B	they would just assume you
A	yeah
B	but his family must be rich and therefore you know it's good to have someone from a rich family you know work here
A	D'you want anything from the fridge? I don't know
B	well I think
A	well partly yeah but I mean partly I just don't think that
B	yeah I mean that's not a great argument uh it's you've not  you've not  won a debate with the I don't care argument
A	no it's not a great
B	you
B	you've settled
A	I suppose  I suppose  what I'm saying is I haven't given it enough thought because I've never needed to
B	I'm going home
A	well
B	second only to the I don't care argument
A	maybe I'm just not a deep thinker uh maybe I'm just like
B	well that's the
B	uh I'm not much of a deep thinker
B	no that's
A	you're taking the piss out of us I understand but all I'm trying to say is that I suppose it's hard for me to have like
B	no you know what I mean
A	but all I'm trying to say is that I suppose it's hard for me to have like
B	well
A	bet you have
B	like I'm not bitter
A	you did
B	about anything
A	no
A	like yeah no I'm not saying violence like
A	I'm sympathetic
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	sir Robin Day or whatever the
A	well I'm obviously
B	you know Dimbleby does Question Time doesn't he?
A	yeah
B	I think Sir Robin Day used to do it you know
A	I know you're grilling us
B	kind of toff that that Rupert Murdoch was complaining about but uh
A	well if I was going on Question Time I'd have gone through me argument I suppose
B	no I'm just
A	I suppose what I mean is like I'm more concerned with my immediate situation like my little life uh and just like
B	yeah uh uh okay uh no I just
A	I dunno
B	be
A	I dunno I think ever since I finished me me thesis like I'm I'm just totally off any sort of like that research any about anything
B	yeah
A	oh no no I know
B	um
A	well
B	well I think uh if you
A	um it's just more talking probably
B	Cos that would be interesting cos I
A	oh it's a play
B	but Four Extra's interesting um
A	it's a play
B	uh
A	it's a play
B	oh I couldn't no alright
A	pardon me
B	um which is uh which isn't like a bit  usually
A	I don't think about it enough
B	but I didn't really say facts though
A	no but I wouldn't know would I? That's the point
B	no no you come out with a lot of things like about
A	oh wow
B	that's practical anyway uh
A	uhuh
B	yeah no it is practical I mean that's why there are a lot of people like social entrepreneurs or whatever who are trying to actually practically like do something to help people who are um the yeah the typical intelligent kid with parents or from a poor background like there are people who are tying to to actually to to do that uh I think uh
A	yeah
B	well that's that's really
A	not at all
A	Don't even lie about it you know it's true
B	uh yeah your your your your cousin's in like do an
A	no
B	you know you got another one who's like you know a Beijing entrepreneur and you've got another one who's like uh an Olympic swimmer or some another one is like
A	no that's not true
B	um
A	but no
B	that's
A	what do you?
A	and then when I go to my parents they're like D'you want some
B	well that's that's
A	D'you wanna go to the pub?
A	yeah
B	Boris Johnson's got like four hasn't he? So uh
A	well I was reading a thing actually in the Guardian also that
B	he's he's undoubtedly a member of the global elite if anyone ever was
A	I was reading a thing about yeah about how like it's a sign of like
B	affluence if you have loads of babies?
A	um yeah if you have more children
B	or Catholicism or uh
A	yeah
B	um British British um
A	it's it's at the both ends it's like the either ends isn't like?
B	think
A	I don't know yeah
B	um
A	your your dad's a four isn't he?
B	well I know I just hear stories about like a family with uh seven kids that are making a massive amount of money on benefits
A	benefits yeah
B	and I thought that it's it's affluent to have a lot yeah because obviously you're spreading uh
A	yeah
B	if you have a family that's successful then obviously the more in it then then it's more likely that there'll be more successful people down the line
A	yeah
B	um
A	yeah I read about those two
B	um
A	the first reported conjoined twins?
B	why?
A	they were from
B	um
A	um
B	might not be
A	it is yeah and they married two sisters and they had like one had ten kids and one had eleven kids
B	oh right
A	and every year like they have like annual reunions and there was like seven thousand people go
A	they slept in a bed for four
B	like
A	well one
A	they were conjoined
B	oh oh right oh so oh yeah okay
A	yeah but then they started like the wives started getting angry even though they were sisters and so they set up two separate households and they had to spend like three and a half days at one
B	so
A	I know
B	yeah I did actually uh
A	there you go so I got to it from them
B	oh right
A	but they were saying now like they were only kind of very cosmetically conjoined
B	like
A	like now if they were born now they would've just like parted them straight away
B	yeah
A	so
B	right
A	but anyway yeah they had millions of ancestors
A	well I said they all had ten they had ten children each
B	oh yeah oh you mean the the Siamese ones not the  not the  Biddenden ones
A	yeah
B	that's a legend isn't it? Yeah
A	but um wouldn't it be good like if you could like if
B	yeah well we we were I mean we were looking at uh at our uh like bit of our
A	yeah
B	we realized that uh that that if you the further back in time you
A	it's totally different now isn't it like? Everything can be recorded
B	that it at a certain point you know
A	yeah
B	um by a certain amount and then there would be an exponential increase I suppose so um it as you go back
A	you'd have now yeah
B	uh
A	yeah
B	uh although
A	no that's right like
B	yeah I
A	how?
B	Cos if if they're
A	there are more people now
B	like like um
A	well we are all related aren't we I mean? Of course
B	no yeah I meant  I meant  like direct ancestors so like
A	you mean like grandparents grandparents grandparents grandparents or?
B	um
A	yeah
B	your direct ancestors because of course uh it's basic I mean like obviously I've got two ancestors from the previous generation
A	yeah
B	so it's going up exponentially and sort of
A	yeah
B	um
A	so not counting their descendants you mean? I was gonna say X
B	uh
A	yeah
B	alive
A	you don't know
B	uh so you go back no I think it's it's four generations in a hundred years
A	I doubt it
B	well I thought
A	four what? Four thousand years yeah
B	four
A	yeah
B	so
A	alright this is ridiculous
B	Don't wait four uh four in a hundred years
A	right
B	four four in a hundred years
A	I dunno I've lost the
B	so yeah four hundred two to the power of four hundred out of the population would've been your uh ancestors
A	that's a pretty big number
B	but that can't be right because surely there wasn't that many people on the Earth
A	yeah
B	no I mean but there wasn't even that
A	well
B	so it means like
A	mm
B	and and there would only have back in them days ten thousand years ago there would only have been like a handful you know like like a few  a few  million of us
A	well I don't know
B	so technically so almost almost everyone back then would like would've been the ancestor of everybody now
A	yeah
B	that's but you know there you go
A	well I
B	so yeah
A	everybody then's related to everybody now
B	it's not uh
B	no just I'm just trying to say it I think you were talking about how everyone's related to everyone else or or were we not I don't know
B	no
A	I was talking about having loads of ancestors
B	no it's just like you that I I suppose it's it's something that I hadn't thought of before was was uh was how like how interrelated people actually
A	yeah
B	are you know um
A	yeah I mean well I suppose
A	single-celled organisms or what have you
B	what what's it on?
A	um I think we've gone on to Smash Smash Hits Non-Stop
B	yeah awful
A	although Robson Green's quite like that fishing programme's quite good
B	what?
A	that fishing programme's quite good
B	oh it's brilliant yeah
A	bad singer? Did you ever watch uh Soldier
B	so the opposite of David Bowie?
A	yeah
B	no I dunno
A	um
B	um
A	no
B	it's terrible
A	me mam loved that and uh London's Burning
B	and perhaps also Heartbeat?
A	um more of me Nana liked Heartbeat
B	right
B	Sunday night isn't it?
A	yeah Sunday nights
B	old Sunday nights uh London's Burning was on at was at nine till ten or something or eight till nine and then
A	yeah we used to watch it so
B	heartbeat was like
A	well I think Heartbeat was on on different days but
A	to what?
B	what happened in London's Burning then?
A	London's Burning was a programme about like uh fire fighters
B	yeah
A	blackwall I think it was or something like that?
B	oh is it  is it
A	it's up-to-date well up-to-date then
B	uh yeah
A	uh I can still picture some of the guys
B	uh yeah
A	for Christmas
B	I just uh
A	no
B	but
A	well we used to come back from me dad's on a Sunday
B	apart from like well I did watch um
A	yeah
B	and my mum didn't really watch those sort of soap things but she did watch uh murder you know
A	yeah well you can't can't beat a bit of Murder She Wrote
B	so any like Frost or
A	they're timeless those though I
B	yeah
A	me too
B	yeah that with uh
A	with Henry Kelly? Sometimes I used to come home
B	if you come home from yeah if you come home from lunch and then he'll be on yeah I did that once actually with uh at my nan's uh where it was at
A	I used to go home for lunch sometimes
B	um it was weird cos it's a different world isn't it um at home? And then it feels weird that you're in your house
A	I know yeah but only for a short time?
B	and you've gotta get back to
A	I know I used to
B	but that's it's a bit like if if you're at work now and then you come back home although that's that's always quite that feels kind of better though
A	but it would be the same
A	eh?
B	move it on from uh
A	oh I can't watch Alex James
B	you don't have to watch him and you don't really have to listen to him cos he doesn't
A	is it his choices or is it his music?
B	it's his choices
A	he is from the nineties
B	he's a man of the nineties
A	well
B	this is undoubtedly undoubtedly rave isn't it?
A	Andrew asked to
B	oh that's so  that's so  him it's it's so him
A	and uh
B	well no no no that's it's rubbish
A	I had a real thing about Q Magazine I hated it like
B	oh yeah well me I was sort of
A	ah cos he was always just banging on about it and I was like
A	no it's stupid like you know when? I was really bad like when I look back at meself of how I was
B	no I I think a lot of people
A	I used to just
B	oh really? Oh yeah
A	oh no when not when you're older
B	you're older it's it's like
A	exactly exactly when you find someone who likes the same music it's great when you're  when you're  a bit older but when you're that sort of school age you just think ah they're my band like
B	is that something sort of about adolescence or is that just childishness or what?
A	dunno what
B	is it  is it  to do with adolescent uh wanting to be apart? Yeah
A	especially at school where you all have to wear the same thing you all have to do the same thing like maybe it's you know you wanna sort of have a bit of yourself
B	no I
A	yeah
B	well
A	yeah
B	uh
A	I didn't buy any
B	no
A	um
B	I sometimes read Kerrangs that got given to me
A	I like I mean even though like even now I like  I like  the occasional like bird magazine you know like uh Company or like um
B	cosmo?
A	cosmo or Glamour or uh well some of the trashier ones like More
B	no no I
A	Don't be stupid nothing to be embarrassed about
B	can't go
A	you buy New Scientist though
B	but it's in the shop you know
A	I know it's in the shop
A	yeah but buying a
B	Cos I was looking at some in uh at Smith's at the airport and uh
B	uh I I though oh yeah I'll pass the time by looking at a few titles of magazines and yeah it was just like like aeroplane engines or or something like but
A	yeah
B	but loads of specific stuff that that I just wouldn't like wanna
A	lifestyles yeah
B	I'd be interested in a lot of things but I wouldn't necessarily wanna um buy a
A	I dunno it'd be interesting though sometimes I think sometimes it's good to just
B	yeah I saw a few things that were a bit expensive but it was like a  like a  Android thing for for Android phones it was like
A	yeah
B	I think there were two there but it was a book like twenty quid about like Android app making or Andoid developers' guide or something but
A	yeah
B	but no I think these days with with the internet you really don't need to I dunno
A	I dunno I still think there's there's something nice about having like like I'm toying with the idea of getting an
B	yeah
A	there's just something nice about it and
B	yeah
A	it would've been really nice to have like loads of books and different things to read and like
B	yeah
A	so I do like the idea of having a Kindle for that
B	yeah
A	Cos I am  I am  thinking about getting a Kindle
B	oh right
A	I do
B	yeah
A	I might borrow one and then see if I like it and then
B	I'd like to get a new um laptop but that's just
A	yeah
B	but I wouldn't get a Kindle because I don't um sort of
A	they're not that expensive any more though I mean they were  they were  really expensive when they first came out
B	yeah
A	so I'll have a think
B	yeah
A	it's rare that I have like
B	Q's a bit sort of like
A	you get um you get a lot you can get quite a few free I think like
A	um
B	yeah
A	and
B	yeah
A	so
B	well they they can be expensive can't they?
A	yeah
B	but uh
A	but I don't know I mean i'll have to have a real look at it and see if
B	yeah
A	see if I liked it
B	uhuh
A	Cos you know with a book you can just like
B	yeah
A	I think they're good for like you know if your eyes are going funny? Like if you're old lady?
B	yeah
A	like you know I think they would be good then because like big big print books are really heavy
B	yeah
A	but with a Kindle you can like make the print bigger
B	mm
A	I think it would be good if you like had some visual problems
B	yeah
A	and obviously you wouldn't have
B	I mean it's good with a smartphone but it is it can be quite bright and uh
A	I think you can change that though I think you can change the settings cos it is sometimes a bit bright
B	for me
B	about
A	brightness yeah
B	yeah
A	look how bright that is? That would kill the battery
B	yeah I think the thing is when I was reading it in uh in bed and you know it is dark so it's a bit glary it glares on your eyes
A	I know
B	what's it doing?
A	it's calibrating the gyrometer thing
B	you've put it on the you've put it on a
A	like a spirit level? No I'm not doing it
B	the gyrometer
A	you know cos it's got like a spirit level thing in
B	yeah
A	so if it's
B	no I don't  I don't  see the um
A	yeah I think
B	it can't  it can't  do that can it? Or what is it doing?
A	no I think it's like you know when you use Google Maps? So it knows that you
B	oh right
A	I don't know
B	oh yeah so uh so that uh that guy showed me the the app where
A	I'll put that down
B	like how did? I'd like to  I'd like to  get my hands on that app actually
A	I know
B	he could tell you the
A	the street that you're in yeah
B	yeah I mean um makes you paranoid doesn't it?
A	doesn't work if you're phone's off though you would just switch your phone off if I suppose you were doing something you shouldn't be doing
B	yeah yeah
B	I'm not sure
A	ah I bet he's got a sore
B	it sounds like uh it sounds a lot like um Rammstein actually
A	no it's English

B	yeah
A	and like you know that plastic bowl that I've got? In that I sometimes drain the vegetable water into? you know that plastic bowl that's in the
B	yeah
A	so then the next thing I know I'd like balanced this the that plastic bowl filled with gravy on the top of the wall
A	it was like the stupidest dream
B	tremendous
A	na
B	I think
A	there's obviously like work and gravy
B	no I mean um
A	sorry?
B	I hope that there wasn't the result of you know something uh something some worries that you had
A	I don't know
A	like your mam  your mam  like made comments about the fact that I served the gravy
A	and I was like oh sorry
B	well I dunno I mean I don't  I don't  remember that really
A	yeah but
B	Cos they've got they must have like three or something
A	no I'm I'm I'm not saying that her intentions were bad I mean
B	yeah
A	no no no no
B	Cos it was quite a it was it's quite an uh it's it's quite an impressive meal
