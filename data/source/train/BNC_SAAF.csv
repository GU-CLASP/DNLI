A	you want some crackers? you can have that after
C	although
A	your roll
C	Guy
A	well the king the people who supported the king did
C	but actually I think Guy Fawkes was the good guy
A	exactly
C	in how the world is made and they had to go to his church if they wanted to pray and he didn't agree to that so he just did what he thought was right
A	mm?
C	but most people didn't cos they didn't cos they didn't want to get executed like him
B	but that's why they have fireworks night without him there wouldn't be a special occasion which I love cos I get free hotdogs
C	you don't get free hotdogs
A	that's true I remember once telling a Chinese student why we have fireworks night and she thought it was very strange that we remember killing somebody in such a beautiful way
A	but yes it is nice to have fireworks
C	mm mm
A	or odd
C	erm we would probably have figured out another way for fireworks
A	well we've always sort of had bonfires around that time
B	for killing people
C	like Easter Eve
B	what's Easter Eve?
C	the day before Easter
B	mm?
C	and Father's Day Eve

B	no he is
C	Emperor Palpatine technically is the main bad guy
A	mm
C	it's like Kylo Ren he just wants he's just a Darth Vader groupie
B	yeah because Darth Vader erm he
C	I'm guessing he
B	well
C	cos Darth Vader became good
A	well Darth Vader is related to him actually
C	mm
A	well because he's the son of Leia Princess Leia and Princess Leia is the sister of Luke and the daughter of Darth Vader so Darth Vader is Kylo Ren's grandfather
C	do you mean grandson?
A	mm?
C	you said Kylo Ren is Darth Vader's grandfather
A	sorry it's
B	but what about Luke? will he marry somebody?
A	I think not I think he would he will dedicate his life to Jedi being a Jedi
C	well a lot of people think he gave birth to Rey
A	I don't think they think he gave birth
C	well he
A	but was the father of Rey
C	yeah
A	mm
C	although I wonder

C	I wonder who Rey was
A	mm
C	I wonder

C	maybe her brother's Kylo Ren
A	can you stop knocking things near the microphone
B	microphone?
A	yeah
B	micro-what-y?

B	never knew we had a microphone
A	how do you think it's recording your voice? erm now but if Luke is the
B	maybe maybe he thought
C	well who has
B	maybe
A	but she's been left all on her own in that place hasn't she?
B	no
A	it's not the emperor any more is it?
B	I mean the baddie

A	well he's got the force hasn't she? so
C	she's definitely called
A	I don't know
B	but Princess Leia's a tough cookie she is
A	sorry?
B	I like Princess Leia
A	I like Princess Leia too but Princess Leia didn't sort of look at Rey and think oh she must be related to me did she?
B	no cos she didn't know cos Luke didn't cos Luke didn't tell her well
A	I know she didn't necessarily know but you might think she would've felt it if that was true
B	maybe she didn't
C	Darth Vader didn't break it to Luke
A	about what? him being the dad?
C	Luke I am your father
A	but
C	if you're my dad how come you never gave me that rubber ducky I always wanted?
A	mm
C	er
A	Luke and Leia had a connection though didn't they?
C	yeah mwah mwah mwah
A	no they're brother and sister
C	that's it
B	or Han and Leia went
A	sorry?
B	or Han and Leia went
A	I can't really hear what you're saying
C	this is what
A	no erm
A	right who is out of their chair? if that happens again you will have no pocket money this weekend
A	so was it nice watching the film Brave again?
B	yep
C	yep
A	it was a bit perilous though isn't it?
C	mm and weird I wonder what happened to the witch
A	mm
B	woodcarver
A	well she's not a bad person though is she? everything worked out in the end
B	no
C	well they did kind of turn her into a bear
A	she
B	she well she gets it's about a spell
A	she turned her into
A	yes of course she did
C	might not have
A	I think so I don't think she was a bad witch
B	no she said not no remember when she said now what is it about that spell?
A	oh well
B	yeah
A	she's not a bad and evil witch though is she?
B	no
C	were they scared of witches in those days?
A	well this is a sort of set in
C	in Scotland
A	even in Scotland
B	they did believe in the Welsh dragon
A	in the Welsh dragon?
C	leprechauns?
A	this is
B	yeah
A	that's in Ireland this you're looking at
B	oh
A	Scotland
A	it's Scotland that's just a myth though
B	they
C	for now
B	well they did believe in legends
A	mm?
B	so could've believed of the Loch Ness
A	I'm not sure how old the Loch Ness
C	mm mm
A	legend is though
B	over a thousand years
A	how do you know that?
C	a Loch Ness monster must be old
A	mm?
B	well the teacher
C	did not
B	she said I think it's one thousand years old
A	mm mm?
C	and who was the teacher? you?
B	Miss
A	I don't think it's that old
B	well
A	and it's a big it's a big lake I'm sure more people would've spotted it
B	it's a legend mum
A	oh
C	it's a monster
B	I dunno she just told me there was a legend
A	most countries have a sort of legend about a giant beast like a dinosaur type figure
C	what's our one?
A	saint George and the dragon
C	well actually but
B	what what's Wales's one? because they
A	mm yes
C	I was going to say that saint George wasn't famous for slaying the dragon
A	what was he famous for?
C	he was famous for saying that no for saying no to the king about having to be erm having to have a different religion and not being able to do his normal beliefs and he and that's how he died he became a marty
A	a martyr?
C	martyr
A	but that's not yeah but that's not the legend the legend that's grown up it's the same thing about king Arthur
C	king Arthur
A	king Arthur didn't exist in the way we imagine it
C	how was king Arthur then?
A	well cos we always think of king Arthur as a a king of medieval England but there was an Arthur sort of in charge of an area of England I think in the fifth century but nothing like you know it wasn't at the time when they had jousting and knights and shining armour
B	medieval?
A	so they and and you know stone castles it wasn't like that at all but people have always like that those stories that legend
B	yeah but what's Wales's legend? I mean what beast do they have they've got
A	well yes the red dragon as you said
B	no they made friends with the red dragon
A	yeah but dragons didn't exist really though did they?
C	do we know that?
B	they did make friends with it but what's the beast? because the Loch Ness
A	well the Loch Ness is not a nasty creature
C	it's never been known to do destruction
B	and what did it?
A	it's just a big animal
B	but what did it do?
A	doesn't do anything it just stays in the lake
C	yeah it's like a giant sea snake
A	it's like a dinosaur it's like a
C	diplodocus?
A	sorry?
A	diplodocus no but it looks sort of slightly like a diplodocus but the reason why they have these legends is because at some point they will've seen you know the fossilised prints of a dinosaur and thought oh what was that? that must've been a big animal that used to walk on the Earth and is no longer or there's often legends about giants you know?
C	oh yeah
A	cos everyone thinks that there there was a time before when there were er giants roaming the Earth
C	we found we haven't found any footprints yet
A	no but it's funny that it's quite common to most civilisations but then they have found you know in prehistoric times absolutely giant snakes and giant er
C	oh yeah I heard of this giant snake that was like er bigger
A	absolutely enormous so there's a there's a a model of one I showed it to you a couple of years ago
C	yeah
A	absolutely huge you know and the same thing if you saw er one of those crocodiles it would just be really scary
[ANNOTATION]	Person A is talking about the huge crocodile that are really scary	Entailment
B	yeah
A	mm
C	it's weird how far legends go
B	but they are true in a way because there are really big people who are really strong just like
C	yeah
B	and they're kind of giants but they're not the huge ones which could look at this house and go hello? hello?
C	well
A	mm?
[ANNOTATION]	Person A agree with Person B about the giants	Contradiction
[ANNOTATION]	Person A agree with Person B	Contradiction
C	they're based on the truth
A	not necessarily
C	no legends are meant to be based on the truth
A	no they're not they're just meant it's first of all it's a story it usually has a meaning doesn't it?
C	yeah
A	it has a meaning behind it that doesn't necessarily mean it's true
C	no not true but
[ANNOTATION]	Person C believe that base of no legends are on the truth	Entailment
A	but it's an important thing to know about
B	well
C	yeah it could sometimes it has a little bit of truth in cos
A	mm
C	well you know
C	yeah in prehistoric times that may have saved that
A	no no no because the what I'm saying is er the we were not around at the time were we? I think that storytellers looked at the prints on the ground and thought oh my goodness
A	there was obviously some giant animal roaming the Earth I wonder why it doesn't why it's not here any more that must be because some brave hero rescued us against it that's what I'm that's where it comes from
C	yeah
C	which is
A	well it's not a sort of it's not a lie it's a
[ANNOTATION]	Person A think that giants are real	Neutral
C	I'm trying to find the right word
A	but it always
A	for me it always comes back to humanity yes
B	there is a legend which is true in Wales that the buildings and the sea were drawn as a picture the buildings the trees the houses under the sea
A	what is that then?
[ANNOTATION]	Person A has doubt about the Person B's words	Entailment
B	the legend
A	I don't remember it what was it?
B	one night there was this building which
A	mm?
B	around it
A	mm
B	and it was right across the sea and they built this gate around it so you
A	mm?
B	but somebody forgot to close it so the waves came in and all the houses and the trees sank to the bottom went to the bottom of the sea
A	of it? a photograph?
B	a picture of a picture of a forest under the sea
C	what would be really scary
B	mm
C	if they were still alive and they had grown gills and flippers like when Harry Potter ate
A	yeah
C	that gillyweed and they'd be like
A	had become amphibian
C	yeah and then they'd
B	and the trees
C	and then whenever someone went back to there they would jump out and drag them under the sea ah
A	I mean it's not necessarily true
C	well
A	but it's like the legend of the green children isn't it? they've all
C	huh?
A	I tell you that all the time the the green children of Woolpit which is a village in Suffolk near to where I used to teach and it's
C	oh la la
A	er and it's recorded in a couple of different books and it's about the story of these the
B	but why did the boy die?
A	cos he didn't want to be there and he just sort of pined away and didn't eat
C	what does pined away mean?
A	when you're really sad about something and you want to kind of go back to somewhere you kind of give up but it's such an interesting story oh and
A	it's in two er written twice
C	what?
A	and I
C	that is just
A	it's a bit weird isn't it?
C	mm well actually there was this lady who ate loads and loads and loads of carrots and her skin eventually got an orange tinge to it
A	yeah
C	so that so they might've actually become green from eating all that green food
A	well and especially if she was in a place where they were hiding in caves or something so she didn't have any sunlight perhaps her face would've been green but I
C	or she would've just felt very ill
A	yeah but I've always found it really interesting
A	and the fact they didn't speak any English for years I just find it fascinating there must be some sort of truth behind that particular
B	oh yeah
A	erm and he
C	mm mm mm
A	can you remember?
B	I can
C	Dick Whittington?
A	no it's not Dick Whittington but it's very similar he met somebody who told him that she or he or she'd had a dream about someone finding treasure in their own back garden so he then went all the way back to Swaffham dug up his garden and then there was loads of treasure in the back garden
A	and again you just think well there must be some kind of truth about it because it's a named person in a particular village
B	I've got an idea maybe it's
C	well to be fair
A	hang on
B	maybe it's erm if you you when you travel far away
A	mm?
B	if you if you if you try really hard then someone who
A	yeah I mean it but it's a it's a really cool legend
B	yeah
A	it's
B	yeah
A	it's not that it's completely made up so there there must be there must be some some kind of truth in there
C	I'm guessing that they said they would find their riches in London and he kind of did
A	well he kind of did and he needed to make that journey and that's the hero's journey isn't it? is that actually he could've just if the dream had been more specific he could've just
C	who was he? a person who dug a person who digs in his back garden but doesn't plant flowers?
A	I don't know but he did give
A	some money to the church you know he wasn't greedy with it
C	mm I mean some people
A	I don't think anybody would think that darling
A	if they're starving to death they've got some gold then they'll sell it and
C	mm
A	they'll get some food won't they?
C	but if they're in the middle of a desert?
A	mm?
C	then they'll be wishing they were in the middle of a dessert
A	true I really want to read to you this erm story Great Expectations by Charles Dickens
