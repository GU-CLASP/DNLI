B	yeah but it's not until it's confronted
A	yeah
B	no
A	like getting them fired
B	well in theory
A	yeah I think  from what  from what my Michael's saying which is why he didn't want me to go in as an officer is so you know I don't think you'll have so much fun cos you know people won't be able to have a laugh and banter with you like they can with each other cos they're really not allowed

A	mm
B	erm my problem my my worry is that maybe when I'm there I might get carried away in joining in and taking the piss out of them and then I'll get in trouble
A	mm
B	for being too familiar with them which is a bit of a
A	yeah
B	no
A	mm
B	but I suppose when you're there and there's other people that are officers to learn from that have already done that position for ages you'll know what type of behaviour to adopt won't you

B	mm
A	mm
B	whereas I won't be able to go home and be silly
