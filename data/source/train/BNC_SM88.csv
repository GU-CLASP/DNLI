D	nine grand a year
A	totally wrong
B	mm
E	a year?
D	well a term so it's like two terms
E	eighteen grand a year
D	oh no
E	mm
D	but it's two terms basically and then you
A	that's stupid
B	mm
D	and
B	yeah
D	are at least three years
A	mm
D	so that's twenty-seven
B	well I wouldn't have gone
A	I wouldn't have gone oh I didn't go
A	I went to the university of life
B	I don't my parents couldn't
C	yeah
D	mm
B	but mm
E	yeah I do to pay that back though
C	yeah
B	mm
D	if you erm earn
B	but only when you earn a certain amount
D	yeah and then
E	oh
D	if and if you get to the age of
B	yeah
D	forty I think it is you don't have to pay it back but erm
D	yeah
E	to explain to me
B	well some people never have to pay it back cos they never earn
D	mm
B	never earn more than whatever it is
A	well around about
B	yeah
A	ninety percent of graduates don't get a job
B	no they don't they?
C	there's been an increase recently
A	really?
C	yeah there's been an increase
A	mm
C	there's been an increase
E	I've thought
B	oh
E	of a job a detective
B	a detective?
E	I'd love to spy on people
B	oh yeah
E	I'd now be so good
B	all my initials are
A	excuse excuse me
B	yeah
B	yeah
B	I spot lots of things
E	I think I'd just love it like I love all crime shows and police
B	mm
E	and
B	no okay
E	I like everything it's so good
B	yeah
E	yeah
B	school friend? she's doing erm
E	yeah
B	yeah
E	I think I would probably do
E	yeah I started watching a thing about murderers
E	and like if they have if they have like something in their brain what makes them like be a murderer
B	well they're obviously they're they're not
C	there's a
B	like us are they? they're not
E	no
C	I think there's a
B	there is
C	genetic part of it
B	there has to be something
E	cos they did like scientific erm animals first or something and they like zapped certain parts of the brain like
C	yeah
E	if there was more of it
B	mm
E	if it made them attack
C	and more aggressive
E	and if one part of like the brain is zapped the I can't I think it was a rabbit or something just went and attacked another rabbit like
E	killed another rabbit so like one part of the brain if there's more of it it brings aggression like and it's obviously it makes it easier for people to kill
B	yeah
E	cos they have more aggression
D	then you've got to take erm you do it psychology you've got to take in
E	yeah
D	erm
B	mm
D	so like their parents' relationships and stuff
E	yeah like on erm Kid Criminals or was it murderers and teenagers?
B	yeah
E	erm he'd been in the USA this one boy he was like fifteen and he killed his mum and stepdad
B	oh
E	just shot them like ten times
B	yeah
E	mm like your own mum
C	what makes you do it that's the thing isn't it?
B	yeah
B	ah
E	stepdad and like left him or something and I think his stepdad abused him or
B	mm
E	that would be quite interesting
B	yeah
B	yeah I suppose you can
B	if you've been abused you're
E	no
B	mm
D	there's meant to be five stages
B	yeah
D	you do that in psychology as well
B	mm
E	or a lawyer
B	yeah
E	mm
C	you got to go to university for that though you
C	you need to
E	and law
C	and
D	oh no oh no you don't do law at A Level
C	no
D	no
C	no
E	why?
D	cos they don't like you doing law at A Level
C	they want you to have a good grounding so if you did classics or like classics
E	yeah but I'm not gonna do English I only got a
C	and English
E	got a C in English
C	no but
B	you'd have to go to a university for law wouldn't you?
C	yeah you're gonna
D	yeah so
C	you will have to get a C
B	mm
C	you're gonna have to
E	now I've got a new teacher cos
D	no but you have to
E	yeah I know I think I will er with this other teacher I'm having next year which is not the teacher I have at the moment
D	yeah
B	mm
E	that must be really annoying though
C	you get to it
E	mm
C	and the others you can deal with but the four
B	mm
C	and they cause a and they cause a problem
E	mm
B	yes it's not not that important is it?
C	no
B	no
C	and what they and what you know it's about problem solving and
B	mm
C	but they just no they just do it but why do I need to do it?
B	yeah
C	you know and it and I know full well that
E	what do they not bring?
B	so even if they're doing the GCSE is then they aren't
C	the I don't well GCSE will be a little bit different they don't do GCSE anymore we do something called a
E	yeah but do you not get them to bring food in?
C	no
E	well that's like the problem is isn't it?
C	well
E	like they never provided me with food I always had to bring it in
C	yeah but the problem is
E	yeah but then it's their fault
C	and then it causes
B	yeah
C	then it causes you a problem because
B	absolutely
C	you've got half the class who are
B	mm
C	cooking and half the class that might
B	mm
C	bring their food in and then you have the kids who aren't cooking are messing around because they you know
B	mm
C	you know
E	that must be so expensive though cos you have er like thirty people in each class
C	no we've got groups of twenty
E	well it's
C	our our
B	right
C	and they used to and I used to say
C	yeah
B	I see yeah
A	what is it money?
B	yeah but if comparisons with doing food
A	oh I see yeah
B	yeah
E	that would be like nine thousand a year
C	on just I said
E	for children
C	yeah
A	wow
C	you know and and the boss it's quite interesting cos the boss turned round and said
C	buy it from Tesco's
B	it is
A	yeah
B	often
A	that is
B	yeah
A	you know when I had to help
B	and we had the odd things didn't we from
A	we
B	erm
A	biscuits and stuff
B	yeah
A	they were half the price you could buy them from the wholesalers
C	yeah
B	mm
A	so I used to just put them on the shelf just as a sort of a
C	yeah
B	yeah we went to the wholesalers just cos we thought we could get
C	them dead cheap
B	you
C	yeah
B	it doesn't make sense though does it?
C	it don't
B	I mean
C	no
B	who who actually buys it in the end?
C	yeah yeah
B	small shops? I don't know
C	and you grab your mm yeah okay
B	yeah
E	and you can go to Makro's now can't you?

A	yeah
B	mm
A	but er
B	I don't know
A	Tesco's and Sainsbury's and people like that they they buy
A	about a thousand you know
B	yeah
A	in bulk so they're able to get them cheaper
C	yeah
A	whereas poor old
B	yeah
A	she has to buy it from a wholesaler which is just as expensive as getting them from Tesco's
C	well she's got because she's got to pay the wholesaler for bringing it
A	yeah
