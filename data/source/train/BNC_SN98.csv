D	mm but I did ask dad when I did it
B	oh which one
D	what he wanted mm their chips here are quite good as well aren't they?
A	yeah they're good
C	yeah
B	they're nice and
A	you haven't eaten that onion ring yet
D	they're nice and crispy
B	well have it
A	no
B	I don't want it
A	I'm completely stuffed
B	oh why did you mention my onion ring then?
A	just I was surprised you haven't eaten it
B	I had a few
A	just cos I mention it doesn't mean I want it
B	no I know it does when I mention something
A	my granddad used to do that
D	mm
A	he always used to be like oh you've got a bit of sausage left
A	it's my sausage
B	well
A	yeah
B	then you know you don't have to
A	well prior to even starting the meal I'm like remember that I get my extra third
B	yeah
A	being a guy
B	sometimes
A	I'm a third bigger third stronger
A	I need a third more food
B	but there's certain foods that I really don't wanna share
A	but that's the problem
B	cos I don't have them often enough
A	she'll happily give me a third if it's something she doesn't care about but
B	if it's something that's special
A	you can't just have a rule that's one or the no it's gotta be for all of them
D	yeah why?
A	it's a bit like this cake I'm holding like a third of it
B	yeah it was good
A	those chillies too spicy then?
B	yeah that's what ruins them all though
C	shall I get you another drink dear?
D	no thank you
A	what is that sauce?
B	oh this is tartar sauce it came with my dad's fish and chips
A	what is it?
B	I don't know
A	no
B	because there's
A	it's very weird
B	has has it got erm has it not got gherkins and stuff in it?
D	yeah pickles
B	and pickles it's like a
D	pickles yeah
B	pickle with mayonnaise
A	looks kind of horrible
B	I'm not sure why it's there did you put it there?
D	mm
C	no I did
B	yeah
C	save you reaching over
B	yeah
D	did I tell you about the tartar sauce at the home?
B	yeah
D	I did oh
B	they cancelled it
D	yeah they wouldn't let they were they're not allowed to order any more
A	why's that?
D	cos it's
B	it's the budgets or something I think worse things goes on there than than them not having their fucking tartar sauce
B	pardon my f-ing
B	but yeah
D	yeah
A	sounds like the place needs more money doesn't it?
B	they can only have mayonnaise
D	yeah cos they don't they're not run as erm
B	it was run by
D	caring community you know a caring place anymore it's run as a business
A	yeah
D	erm a money-making business
A	which is terrible
D	and and it's not it shouldn't
B	no
A	no it's a service for old people that need help
D	mm
B	there should be nothing private about it it should be a public service that meets the requirements that you'd want for yourself
A	carers never get paid very well either do they?
D	no
B	no
A	my auntie's a carer
B	oh so
A	yeah she's a carer she works for erm she works with mentally
B	oh you said yeah
A	handicapped people but
B	does she go into their homes or is it
A	erm she's done a variety of care jobs
B	yeah
A	I think currently she's a bit in more of a managerial position located somewhere with a with a bunch of people a community
D	mm
A	but still the pay's no good I think she's got more responsibility but no more pay and it's
B	probably
D	it's rubbish the pay
A	yeah
A	it's not on
D	with these the other job is a bit better paid
A	oh it is?
D	slightly yeah
A	that's good
D	it's erm I'm on six six seventy-four now at the moment
A	yeah
D	er the next one is seven twenty an hour but I get seven eighty at weekends because I don't get any
A	oh nice
D	different weekend rate here
A	do you get any like erm are there any opportunities for double time or time and a half?
C	no not really
D	no well well
A	no so you don't get that
D	you get time and a half on bank holidays
A	yeah okay
D	and Christmas day you get double pay
A	yeah
D	and that's the only day of the year they pay double
A	are you gonna be doing Christmas day this year?
D	well
A	yeah
D	cos I won't be at the care home and I wouldn't have thought they they do one within the community
B	I no I don't think any of them do you know
D	on Christmas day I'm not sure
B	no I'm gonna
A	you're gonna want your mummy home on Christmas day
D	yeah
C	that's well mine isn't isn't even sorted
D	that's what she's she's already told me that
B	she's not working Christmas day or Boxing Day
D	I probably I won't have to
A	what about your birthday?
B	birthday I probably won't be at home
A	I'm gonna be really
D	have you?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	but worried
B	the modules he's chosen are all like about breaking it down breaking down the language and he gets
A	it's more scientific
B	he gets these forty-eight hour exam papers they take away but you only have forty-eight hours
A	I've got three different modules with it and they're all gonna hit me on the first week of January so
B	I'll have I'm have my biggest assignments in N2 though
A	so I'm gonna be erm busy we're gonna be busy
B	yeah but there'll be time for Christmas
A	hopefully so
B	there will be Baileys in your coffee
A	yeah we'll just skim your birthday
D	so you'll you'll you'll be coming home for Christmas?
B	oh yeah
D	what what are you doing
A	erm as a joke I was gonna go to my
A	but she'd kill me so
D	oh you're going to mum
A	I've gotta go to my mum
B	technically it's his dad's turn
A	yeah it's my dad's turn
B	the last time we were in England for Christmas you did spend it with your mum
A	when was that two thousand and six?
B	that was quite a while ago
A	it's the last Christmas I had with my parents I think obviously so
C	eight years ago
D	was that must have been yours as well then
B	because we no yeah two thousand and seven no it was two thousand and seven
A	was it seven?
B	cos we went to Amsterdam for New Year
A	I'm sure the only Christmas I did was the first year at uni
B	two thousand and six we were in Paris two thousand and seven we went I went home and then
A	what I did I do? I don't think I really went home
B	did you not go home?
A	I don't think I did
B	and then we went to
A	after my parents split Christmas just became a bit er
C	no
A	not a really big fan of it anymore
B	mm but yeah two thousand and seven probably
A	not that long ago only seven years
B	cos two thousand and eight we were in
A	well hopefully the next few places we'll work we'll be a little bit closer so
D	mm
A	if we're going Middle East we can get home for Christmas we can do those kind of things
B	well it doesn't it depends on their working holiday
A	on the vacation yeah whether we get this time off
B	so if the country doesn't celebrate Christmas the chances are
A	which they don't
B	we won't have them off
D	oh
A	if we go to the Middle East then the weekend is a Thursday Friday
D	oh is it?
B	yeah
A	yeah Saturday Sunday you work that's like Monday Tuesday
B	they have different days of the week
D	oh
C	oh right
A	yeah so Thursday Friday is the weekend so
D	that is weird isn't it
B	I'm not sure why
D	oh
B	Wednesday must be a significant end of something
D	perhaps it's their erm
B	I mean there's no reason Saturday and Sunday should be the weekend is there just cos our culture does it
A	we've just set it well Saturday was the Sabbath wasn't it?
B	well some and Sunday was the church day
A	and Sunday was the day the sun
B	so they maybe they go to church on a Thursday or Friday
D	yeah perhaps perhaps their religion is sort of
B	yeah
D	different days for church yeah cos they're Muslims aren't they?
A	yeah
B	yeah yeah
D	they Muslims? yeah
A	yeah thank you very much are we all done? yeah are we right
