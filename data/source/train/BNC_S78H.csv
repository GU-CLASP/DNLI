C	so this winter camping thing is a bit
B	what?
C	I mean you're not you're not the only people doing it
B	well as far as I can see we are
C	oh god
C	and the last time was up in Comrie was it?
B	yeah yeah
C	but I mean are these spots where people would camp in the summer?
B	no
C	no
B	they're just out in the
C	no it's wild camping but are
B	erm
C	are they places you would choose to camp in? in if you went there in the summer as well?
B	erm
A	the way we hit on them was that you've been going there since you were a kid
B	mm mm
A	and you'd known these spots like going for a walk with your dad
B	mm mm
A	and
C	mm
A	picturesque
B	and we tend to wait until it's really cold
C	so there'll be absolutely nobody there?
B	well well it's more that erm
A	mm
B	so it makes walking
A	but it was very comfortable to walk on
B	very easy and you never your boots don't get wet and
C	yeah
C	wild winter camping in Scotland I mean that's
C	yeah and you could be taking erm you know these crazy Americans on
A	yeah
B	actually we'll show you some pictures
A	oh that'll be nice
B	we'll show you some pictures later after we've done this erm
unknown_female	mm
B	erm
A	but that's the ironic thing that we have just been to
B	uhu
A	so you know it was very peaceful
C	mm
A	so
C	can imagine
B	and then you've got you know there's places you try and go places where there's not too much light pollution so you can get the stars there was one camping trip we did at Corrour
unknown_female	uhu
B	in December
A	yeah
A	with a hip flask
B	with a hip flask in my hand
A	to to keep us going
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	added warmth
B	yeah
C	ah it sounds good
B	yeah it was really good
A	because there aren't many places here now where you can see the Milky Way
C	no
A	so
C	you'd have to go very far north I'd imagine to get away
A	yeah
C	from all the light pollution
B	we would see them at erm Abernethy wouldn't we? right
A	yeah
B	like in the middle of the wood
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	and I'm sure you know when we were growing up
B	mm
A	now it's so rare when you
C	yeah
A	that it's so clear
C	but
B	oh right
C	erm you know
B	oh yes?
C	er just off of er
B	yes
B	mm mm
C	when you're driving up there in the dark and
B	mm
C	erm
B	mm
C	but of course that doesn't
A	mm
C	it's wider
A	the place we'd like to go to is
C	oh yeah
A	erm
C	yeah I've been
A	have you?
C	yeah
A	oh right
C	just driving through
A	right
A	was it an attractive area?
C	yeah yeah
A	uhu
C	but the the they'd they'd hooked up all these speakers
A	mm mm
C	settle
B	huh
C	and then fly off again
B	oh
C	and
A	I can imagine cos one of the most spectacular things I've seen
C	mm
A	landing or taking off or circling
C	yeah
A	into the wild to see things like that
C	what what do ravens look like exactly cos they're just they're very similar to crows and whatnot aren't they?
A	yeah
C	oh
A	said that they were ravens and that that they were ravens and that ravens stick together and crows are more solitary so
B	oh is that right?
A	you can see flocks
C	flock a flock of ravens yeah
B	oh I didn't know that
A	mm
B	mm
C	well that'll be nice to see
A	it's a bit raucous
C	yeah
C	I would imagine
B	erm
A	don't know about weird but er
B	yeah I was just wondering what I saw this weekend although you weren't camping but whether it was a raven or what what birds would be up quite high at three thousand feet? would it be a raven?
C	kites?
B	no it was either it was one of those those
A	that family was it?
B	yeah
A	mm
B	I think I think
A	yeah?
B	need to look up the difference between ravens rooks and
A	crows?
B	and
A	mm
B	yeah
C	mostly deers
B	erm
B	we didn't see much did we? we didn't see
A	we we saw quite a lot of deer
B	did we?
A	on the cos I was on a different walk
B	oh yeah but camping we didn't see any deer but there was this time we were camping
A	it was summer so it wasn't strictly winter
B	erm
A	yeah
B	can I talk about camping? in the summer?
C	yeah yeah
B	and erm
C	on their patch
A	mm
B	and so we stayed there cos we you know had everything set up and then we carried on it was starting to get dark and we were cooking and
B	and literally we
A	mm
B	they were really fed up I think that we were on their bit
A	it was the nearest pose a dear could take to standing with its hands on its hip
C	gently sort of shaking its head from side to side
A	yeah that's right yeah
B	that's not allowed
C	get out of here
B	I know it was very funny
A	there's something about camping outdoors where
B	mm
A	and the outdoors is right there
C	yeah
A	it's better even than staying in a hotel
C	warm and dry
A	warm and dry
C	yeah
A	yes
B	mm
A	it's the loveliest
C	yeah
A	experience really
B	we always eat the same thing when we're camping
A	yeah
B	in
C	you haven't moved to couscous no
B	but we do do pasta and tuna and
A	mm
B	but we got really annoyed this time
C	yeah
B	and chilli
A	no and when you read the tin it said
B	like
A	low amount of oil for health reasons or something like that
B	that keeps us going all night and
B	telling you about
A	cos I was a bit chilly
C	yeah
A	I have to admit with my er
C	regular sleeping bag?
A	so I wanted to
B	what was it it you you read the instructions?
A	well what they said was about down bags is that people buy them
B	it's quite interesting
A	without knowing a lot about them and
C	mm
A	will make a difference
C	really?
A	so you should eat fatty food
C	oh okay
A	and that will that will act as a fuel
A	do star jumps then get in your bag
C	right
C	so a bunch of bunch of deer staring you down as you're doing star jumps
C	no wonder the deer are staring
B	that is funny how
C	but no that makes sense though
A	mm
C	so it's
B	yes it's not really really
C	it's not gonna heat you up
B	it's not gonna heat you up it's gonna keep your keep your heat but
C	yeah
A	no
B	yeah
C	but that's
B	makes sense
C	well I'm sure they'll design one with an electric blanket
B	yeah heated heated down what do you call it
A	yeah
C	just you know with those erm like fibre optic or something
A	yeah
C	you you know you press press them
B	you just plug yourself in
C	yeah it'd have to have like a really good battery life or something just keep you toasty through the night that'd be nice
A	yeah
C	good
B	but we would never get cold in the tent
B	you cook from your sleeping bag
A	leaning out into the porch
B	mm mm
A	yeah
C	and what sort of distance do you cover? before
B	well these trips we didn't leave till two in the afternoon it got
B	er dark at half four so
A	yeah
B	that was within
A	total trip
B	twenty-four hours
A	two half days
B	two half days
A	mm
B	and then
A	mm
B	the other one
A	oh well we did two days but we didn't
B	the second day no?
A	yeah because the second day
A	yes
C	you you
A	well
B	we were only planning to go one night it was so
unknown_female	yeah
B	and er there was
A	mm
B	there's one
A	no
B	I think we got an onion didn't we?
C	that's what I liked about
B	oh yeah
C	was stopping off in little villages and picking up the local sausage or the local cheese and the local pastries
A	mm
B	mm
C	cos even going from village to village in the mountains there's quite a stark difference between each
B	mm
C	erm place
A	yes
C	and it's
A	definitely
A	yeah
C	in terms of
B	uhu
C	the availability of the same
A	that's the lovely thing about France though is that er
C	yeah
B	I think it's still central but it's sort of in a
C	international
B	mm
A	well the quality
C	people's passion for it
A	yes
B	well it's not revered in any way it's it's it's just you know it's just stuck in
A	fuel
C	yeah
B	fuel with lots of calories and
A	yeah
C	well we were we were talking about this at the party last night about how
A	mm
C	erm
B	mm
C	and
A	mm
C	here we've got to label it and brand it because people
A	yeah
C	otherwise want their twenty P cucumber and
A	mm
C	there's they don't realise that that's
B	mm
C	and it's not really realistic
A	also people forget that we grew up
C	mm
A	vegetables
C	and
A	seasonal
C	that's
B	mm mm
C	that's the one thing that people take have lost
A	and the cost would be a
B	mm mm
C	yeah
A	so people use supermarkets because they're you know making all this produce
C	well also they're doing those deals with the farmers where the farmers are
A	yeah
C	struggling aren't they?
A	that's right
C	well
B	yes
C	not struggling but
C	almost almost yeah well I mean it's a double edged sword isn't it really?
B	mm
C	farmers are it's not
A	that's why I'm always prepared to spend our money on good food
C	yeah
A	I think if somebody's taken the trouble to
C	well then yeah
A	we should reward them
C	yeah
B	mm
C	that that was the nice thing about living in in
B	yes
C	so
B	yeah
B	but I hate going in there and all that plastic stuff when you can go to a market it just doesn't
C	yeah
B	make sense does it? dad and
A	oh yeah?
B	while they were there they'd go to markets as well
A	mm mm
C	think
B	markets?
C	the Spanish yeah the Spanish lifestyle
B	mm
C	but yeah dunno
A	mm
C	don't know
A	mm
B	or where they come from
C	yeah
A	yeah
B	where do they come from?
C	but this is it I mean
A	mm
C	in terms of the their
A	it's ironic that they've actually got a good reputation for vegetables
C	yeah yeah
A	three pounds
A	three fifty?
C	erm
A	wow
C	according to
A	mm
C	I don't know he said it was nice
A	mm
C	probably need to buy him a case of the stuff to apologise for last night but that's
C	no I'm
B	uhu
C	but
B	mm
C	I think it was more that they couldn't contact us
B	right
C	cos
A	were they worried?
C	no I don't think worried but it's
A	right
C	the the the
A	mm
C	no
A	he didn't
C	yeah
A	so
C	it's funny though
A	yeah
C	if if for some reason you can't get through it's a it's a disaster and
A	yeah
C	oh god you know
B	mm
C	I dunno I dunno think that some people have always been like that but
B	mm
C	almost kind of expect people to be able to answer them all the
A	mm
C	no
A	use it if I'm out in the hills
B	yeah
C	yeah there's no need really is there?
A	no
C	you've got it on you so if there's an emergency
A	well you see I'm even a little bit extreme on that front
C	ah yeah
A	so I think
A	they know they have to rely on themselves
B	what have phone depots in the highlands?
C	have
A	yeah
C	chasing you and not checking if you've got the right
A	yeah that's right
C	yeah
A	yeah to
C	and and by the way you know that waterproof
C	yeah
A	cos there's too many people I think going out now
C	prrr
A	can you come and get me?
C	yeah
A	really?
C	erm
C	yeah
B	god
C	taking them
A	mm
C	funnily enough you the weather changes up there so quickly
B	mm
C	these things happen
A	yeah when I think back to my school days and the field trips
C	they'd almost sort of encourage you to be a bit like yeah yeah go on run up that one go on
A	yeah
C	tire you out
A	yeah
B	aye
C	then I'd have to volunteer to help out with the
B	mm mm
B	oh aye
C	that could be an offshoot of the book
A	well you did try that didn't you with
B	yeah
A	you took her camping
B	yeah
A	but it was a bit beyond her comfort limit was it?
B	well she she did very well but I discovered
C	when was this in winter?
B	I suddenly discovered no it was in summer so there were midges actually
C	oh okay
B	probably worse than winter camping
B	so that's where we peed
A	mm mm
B	and er she didn't like the smoke
A	mm
B	and then she got into the sleeping bag and I was still outside and then suddenly she squeaked
A	fly sheet?
B	yeah
C	yeah that's gonna freak a little girl out isn't it?
C	fair enough
B	she's very polite I
A	alright
B	alright that's fine
C	least she at least she was honest
B	yeah
A	alright
C	no I want to get
B	yeah
C	although I dunno how how young should you start with camping?
B	oh very
C	I could take him this summer
B	oh yeah
A	yeah
C	three years old
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah I think you should
C	even just for a night
B	yeah
C	I I don't I don't think
B	and definitely
C	but
B	erm
C	but there's enough
B	like May
C	repellents and smoky fires and things
B	mm no midges are a nightmare but May May June is fine
C	yeah I know but
B	or September
C	and
B	mm
C	should be okay
B	mm
A	mm
C	cos erm
A	yeah
C	and you don't have to
A	yeah
B	yeah definitely
A	I think
B	did he?
B	mm
