D	you don't want to get too cocky do you?
C	absolutely not oh mum are you out?

A	ninety-nine percent luck one percent skill
E	I think it's strategy
B	it's tragedy or strategy?
E	strategy
B	mm yeah
A	well what strategy's involved in this game?
E	because you have to think it's quite mathematical you have to think what what's the risk? how many of the cards are left in the deck of the same that you're looking for
B	yeah yeah it's a bit
C	or probability of the cards coming up
E	exactly
B	I bet it's my brother
E	oh is that someone on the phone?

A	the slow play
D	yeah I'd rather get on with it cos I've I've lost points there so I just want to get on and regain some points
B	no no chance
A	it's it's quite good to have it
D	yeah well I like to just get on with it
C	but it's luck so even if you don't shuffle one might say that it's the same as shuffling luck of the cards
E	can you just count them? is that ten?
C	true isn't it depressing? six o'clock and it's pitch black
B	correct ten
