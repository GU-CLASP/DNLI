B	it was really exciting
D	and what was?
D	what was?
B	we had four three bets on
C	they
A	he
C	but he thought the best option was to go each way on Saint Are
D	which is what he did?
C	yeah it was what we did

[ANNOTATION]	we wash hands before eating	Entailment
A	yeah

C	yeah
C	yeah horse
D	yeah
C	you win a quarter of the odds
D	no it has to come in first second or?
C	er
A	third fourth or fifth
D	really?
D	so how substantial is the

C	but five races wasn't that many
D	anyway
C	well we don't don't quite know
A	I've
C	yeah but how many times did you bet when you didn't win? cos like
A	no just the Grand National
A	no we didn't
C	we did it three times
A	no we didn't do it every year
C	erm yeah
D	hey if you put a ten
D	ten pounds on the favourite on on every race
C	favourite never wins
C	but I did think that the favourite was gonna win
D	well if the favourite never wins there's something wrong
D	who is
C	it's the bookie's favourite
D	er so the more people come in that say
C	no but you would start
D	and then that changes as to how many people are betting on it?
