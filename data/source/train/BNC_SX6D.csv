B	right okay so
A	I need to change this thing that it says two thousand and thirteen I want to edit it so that nobody can see it
B	yeah
A	I'll enrol in yours you enrol in mine and then
B	see I don't even know how to do that how do I enrol in yours?
A	I that that actually I think that might be the first thing we need to do isn't it?
B	maybe we should go to the er training sessions
A	it's at two o'clock that you have to register
B	two o'clock you have to register?
A	I can't cos I haven't done the milk
B	oh
A	I'm pretending I know what I'm doing which means
B	mm but I remember last year the training session was useless
A	well if you can't do it it's if we can't do it then it's
B	I just find it really confusing
A	it's definitely different it looks easier doesn't it?
B	it
A	well maybe
B	looks better than it did last year
A	yeah
B	but I didn't use Moodle last year
A	I did a little bit
B	I just preferred using it using my email just found it a lot easier
A	I think once it's one of those things once you know how to use it
B	yeah
A	it's
B	well I've got a proxy on
A	oh I haven't got the proxy on
B	I've got a proxy on
A	you've got a proxy on and yours is working faster
B	yeah
A	yeah well that's yeah we've got to write a welcome message I don't think
B	but where
A	oh god
B	I haven't got a clue
A	we need to go to the training
B	there's a help thing here look
A	a few Moodle help videos
B	I'd rather to be honest just learn myself cos sitting there and just watching someone do it yeah you can take notes but
A	participants oh look how many participants I've got
B	yeah well they were last year's students
A	yeah but that's what they were saying you have to delete your last year students
B	participants no I think
A	oh well it must have just deleted everybody because of the new Moodle and
B	yeah
B	no but it's still got I think what erm
A	no no cos she's asked me before how how do I delete my old students?
B	mm
A	over the years she's like built up loads and loads and loads of students and they're still it says still says that they're enrolled in her
B	oh really?
A	mm
B	okay well we've just got to
A	well okay
B	only got one participant
A	can I sign up to you? then I can see what yours looks like yeah? go in modules?
B	oh module
A	I thought I was signed up to you
B	core modules
A	oh dear this is not right this needs some navigating doesn't it?
B	yeah
A	erm
B	erm my media?
A	search modules are you
B	mm
A	before you can see what you've written so we need to do that really
B	there you go look
A	yeah
B	so that's what's gonna become active next week
A	yeah erm
B	then we've got freshers' week
A	freshers' week
B	which is the one
A	that
B	we need to show them erm?
A	well let's have a look
B	let's go in that that's the one with all the stuff in isn't it all the er this one the treasure hunt and
A	what do they win for the reading marathon?
B	erm
A	cos I know they're gonna ask me what it is last time it was
B	oh it was a pile of shit wasn't
A	Ipad wasn't it?
B	oh yeah
A	no it was good last time
B	oh yeah well yeah
A	do you mean the prize it or the page you're looking at?
B	just looking at the page
A	no
B	well we need to download the
A	that's what this week is for really isn't it?
B	yeah
A	I can't believe that do you remember in in erm
B	mm
A	listening and speaking briefing and that guy I don't know who he is who is he? he said well surely we need to
B	mm
A	it's like how long have you worked here and done the same book?
B	yeah
A	what? and
B	yeah it's probably it's
A	and did you see his face? he was
B	no
A	sitting right in front I don't know cos you might have been blocked by somebody in front of you
A	he was like no
B	come on it's only based on like two reading articles
A	yeah
B	you'd find out what exam you're doing and just read the articles
A	oh my god
B	jesus what a loser
A	yeah
B	yeah he's been here he's been here years
A	so he must know that book inside out
B	yeah
A	oh yeah
B	students can all bring their laptops now
A	yeah how are you gonna
B	well it depends on the class doesn't it?
A	I need
B	to bring them they don't have to have them out every lesson
A	yeah
B	did I press record on this?
A	it is hard to do erm
B	yeah
A	it's hard to suddenly change like to everybody having laptops in front of them doing work
B	mm
A	it's I find that kind of class really hard to prepare for like and how it's gonna go and
B	yeah it kind of makes it may be harder for group work kind of creates barriers between people
A	what physical barriers?
B	well yeah
A	mm
B	and
A	yeah
B	Chinese students
A	what do actually all the writing tasks on a computer?
B	why not? well oh
A	well because their exam is handwritten
B	yeah
A	the exam is handwritten and half of them need to practice their handwriting cos you can't if you can't read it
B	yeah and their spelling as well if there's spell you know
A	yeah
B	auto correct or something
A	unless they've got unless you can find a programme on the internet you know just like a
B	mm
A	what's the point?
A	then you're doing exactly the same as using a pen
B	mm
A	mm anyway where are we? where did you say we'll
B	yeah
A	I've got to get my computer fixed too this week I need to go

B	yeah well if you've got used to Windows 8 and you you wanna and
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A has a MacBook.	Contradiction
A	well I'm still I've still got to learn a lot about it but I basically use it as a desktop anyway
B	mm
A	I don't er I I hardly ever go into the other one but I know
B	mm
A	but I have organised my little app things
B	mm
A	and I thought maybe I could download some more apps I want to download that Chinese one because it's a bigger screen
B	mm
A	and then I really do need the touch screen
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A wants to get more apps.	Entailment
B	mm
A	mm

A	to do much
B	do one?
A	mm
B	so I might do one this year
A	yeah
B	just just to erm put it on my PDPR

B	so I
A	workshops for this term have they?
B	well all the material is there I don't know if they've got someone to teach it
A	wow
B	yes
A	have worked really hard over summer have they?

A	mm
B	and they've tied it together a bit more
A	what was the other one called?
B	it was EAP toolkit
A	oh okay well let's
B	come on events there's the EAP toolkit
A	just general
B	ET yeah shall I have a look how that's different to the
A	I don't think you can access it without the
B	no but does it split into more than just listening?
A	thirty to forty minutes
B	so
A	you have to go right the way in
B	we'll have to have a look
A	to find out
B	at those
A	principal or principle
B	couldn't you?
A	yeah
B	before you'd get familiar with it
A	well if they've all got wi-fi in their computers they can all sit there and really have a look at it
B	mm
A	they need time don't they?
B	yeah er I'd give them like half an hour just
A	yeah
B	no
A	no they're adults
B	I mean they well they don't have to do it in class but it will make them do it wouldn't it and they won't
A	yeah

A	yeah well and then when I got to whoever did the freshers' week of my students last year they didn't get them to sign up to
B	I mean that that was
A	erm
B	thrust down our throats to do that
A	yeah
B	look at all this stuff
A	I'm sure I still had students that weren't signed to
B	no professional
A	I'm thinking of a different university
B	oh
A	I think I'm thinking of a different university
A	oh
B	got signed up to
A	what's this you're on?

B	mm
A	there was only one teacher

B	that's a bit
A	mm
B	or you can download them now I suppose
A	evening lectures
B	mm
A	no you see I don't know why they even tell
B	cos that got so confusing last year
A	the students about it I'm sure when we had our personal tutor presentation on the Powerpoint it said you can go to the academic support unit and then all of the students went there and we all got do you remember?
B	yeah
A	we got that email saying why on earth did
B	yeah
A	I'm sure it was on the we have to check the tutor erm Powerpoint won't we?
B	mm
A	yeah why are they even told about it
B	no I don't know
A	if they're not to go there?
B	I dunno
A	I think they're allowed to go there for their final
B	oh yeah yeah this so this is what the students get isn't it in the class like so this is what he said by bringing in their computers like this isn't gonna be printed so this is what the students are gonna be seeing in class
A	oh right so they can bring in their computers and you can just
B	they can go yeah you just
A	take them up as
B	go through here
A	unless there's a few activities you want to print out
B	yeah

B	I might turn that off now
A	no you just keep showing me what erm what we're doing
B	are you hungry? mm?
B	dinner time
B	right erm so evening lectures is the fourth part
A	are you sure this is the same as the Powerpoints yeah?
B	erm pretty sure I'm sure that's what he said
A	right okay
B	ten runs so that's the same and then we had those classroom rules which is just patronising
A	what's this? we'll call you
B	yeah yeah it's class rules
A	oh
B	right so that's session one and he said we don't have to do these in the same order
A	are you listening?
B	you can do them in any order
A	yeah that was good everything became a bit more flexible didn't it?
B	mm
A	and yeah
B	introduction to Moodle and toolkit so this is where we get them to self enrol
A	okay yeah
B	don't know how that's gonna take two hours
A	we've got get to know you
B	yeah but that would be done in the first one wouldn't it?
A	yeah but well er it's probably a two hour session that's what they said
B	mm
A	like you might not have one hour you might do but you
B	I suppose with the first week I mean if they've done everything just let them go early
A	oh
B	oi are you too interested in our conversation? it's not very interesting
A	no it's not
B	eh?
A	we're talking about professors and things
B	oh
A	oh okay you settle down now
B	EAP toolkit okay self-study task
A	are you just?
B	so there's a self-study task here for thirty minutes I don't know if that's to be done in class
A	what what is it? what do they say?
B	just says log on to EAP toolkit choose one of the skills areas you'd like to improve spend at least thirty minutes doing some of the
A	oh no self-study's at home
B	yeah?
A	yeah
B	it's not self-study in class?
A	yeah it's just she's got to persevere a little bit at the beginning
B	go on get stuck in
A	yeah two lots of fifty minute sessions
B	oh so we do both of those? oh okay I was gonna say
A	well yeah a double
B	so it's four classes?
A	yeah basically
B	but then we've gotta double that with another class yeah?
A	yeah
B	okay so this one's differences between academic and non academic writing
A	fine okay
B	some online resources
A	you have to look at those paragraphs
B	no bugger that
A	well no they need they need feedback though if they're gonna do any writing
B	yeah peer er correction
A	yeah
B	mm
A	you know er a proper structure like
B	mm
A	and then the next time I'm like right have a look at this like different focuses
B	mm
A	have a look at their academic vocabulary and tell me what you think but
B	no
A	then I say write you've gotta write at least one comment
B	mm
A	and they just put very good or something
B	so then session four's about writing emails at university
A	mm
B	er salutations sign offs all that kind of stuff
A	blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
B	so the content of emails
A	do you want to do some blah blah blahs?
B	looking at

A	okay
B	and then by the end of this forty minute session
A	oh speed reading
B	and then some reading comprehension
B	just some more information about reading basically
A	okay
B	session six
A	but it is there's not much many changes from last year
B	no
A	you alright?
B	and the exam and everything
B	is that why she's not?
A	she just keeps turning around and looking at you

B	they only take ten minutes though
A	at those kind of things like I'd rush through them I don't know why but they actually really enjoy them
B	yeah
A	but I well I don't know why I rush through things like that and like oh here's some tongue twisters let's practice them de de de de de de and er they they enjoy them
B	and time management thirty minutes
A	oh cos they had a struggle getting just becoming adapted to university life basically
B	yeah

B	yeah
A	make sure you do some sports they have to do sport don't they?
B	oh no and then they have to make that stupid plan in your in their diary
