B	hmm?
D	mm
D	well if we well we'll just all do it
B	mm
D	and then we'll
B	me
D	well no
B	oh right
D	are you sure?
B	yeah
D	mm
B	after dinner?
D	yeah
B	yeah
B	A
A	really?
D	mm
A	that's exciting
D	how sarcastic was that?
A	no it wasn't
D	oh right
A	it is quite exciting
A	only taken three years
B	oh nice
A	I haven't listened to the Stereophonics for quite some time
D	neither have I actually
A	I don't have this album in its entirety
B	oh it's it's good
A	I like Word Gets Around
B	I
A	right
B	overall
D	yeah
A	oh Peter
D	yep
D	well cos I was mixing it between the two glasses
B	oh
D	I couldn't be bothered
B	wow
A	that is quite impressive
B	I guess we'll just leave all all the stuff for tomorrow in in a bag
B	yeah yeah
A	so who's gonna listen to this recording?
B	um
A	we are  we are  allowed to talk about the recording while it's recording aren't we?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	um
D	we shouldn't do really
D	so the the they don't seem to understand the basic experimental concept
B	the only people who will listen to them are the transcribers
A	transcribers?
B	um
A	oh so people are writing down
B	what you're saying
A	conversations?
B	yeah
A	okay
B	and then um
A	and then it gets fed through some process doesn't it?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	um then put into yeah this sort of online um software thing
A	yeah
B	um
D	er that's
B	yeah
D	yeah
D	that bad boy
B	is it any good?
D	that's for tomorrow
B	huh?
D	your feminine products somewhere else?
A	that's gonna sound really dodgy on the recording isn't it
B	right
A	can I clarify for the sake of the recording that
A	it's just shampoo
A	that's all it is
B	it's fairly feminine shampoo
A	where is the recorder by the way? Oh it's there
D	oh actually
B	move it over here
A	does it pick up everything?
B	um it's yeah it's pretty good
A	it's gonna pick up quite a lot of music isn't it as well
B	yeah
A	how much of a direct range you're using? That's cool
D	cool
A	you just maxed it out then by
A	cupboard
B	yeah
B	it doesn't like that
D	ooh that's a  that's a  good looking bottle
A	yeah
B	oh my God
A	we're gonna try some of that later
D	naturally
A	as long as you're okay with that
D	yeah
A	I dunno don't know what you're like with whisky
D	ooh
A	you might be
B	oh
D	wow
B	that's cool
A	I thought you might be just one of those people who buys it puts it on a shelf and looks at it for a while
A	like sort of admires it
A	caresses it
D	no
A	that's good
D	um
A	has your bin got two compartments?
D	mm
B	it's a recycly one so
D	both's recycling
A	oh right
D	no
A	it's split the other way?
D	well incidentally
D	notice how this bin could almost have been custom made
A	I like the the well damped response of the er
D	yeah
A	yeah
A	there's only so much you can  there's only so much you can  do with a bin
A	but that's quite impressive
D	that is a hundred pounds worth of bin
A	oh that's quite expensive
A	I think ours was like five pound from Tesco
B	oh  oh it's a  it's a horrendously expensive bin
D	yes please
B	okay
D	um
A	do you want me to do something cooking wise?
B	um
A	chop something or? I like chopping things
D	there's not really anything to chop
B	I don't think there's actually anything to chop
A	I can chop garlic
B	do you wanna dice some garlic?
A	yep
B	um
D	can you not
A	yeah
B	behind the piccalilli
D	poke my face
B	sorry
D	ouch
A	behind
B	behind the piccalilli
D	Dan
A	no
D	oh
B	spice rack?
D	sorry spice this
A	right
D	er
B	terrifying
D	this is one of my
A	that's pretty cool
[ANNOTATION]	person A is talking about food	Contradiction
D	I'm not sure
A	Sugar vanilla? What's that?
D	exactly
A	mix for moussaka and
B	Greece didn't it?
D	yeah
A	did you
[ANNOTATION]	they are not sure about sugar vanilla	Neutral
D	um
A	when you came over
D	can't remember it
B	er
B	I think I was putting drinks on it
A	at the end of the kitchen on the right
D	yep
A	where we have a shelf that's about the length of your windowsill
[ANNOTATION]	person A is talking about car	Contradiction
B	nice
A	but er it's just loads and loads of spices
A	is that a word?
D	mm
A	is a word
B	yeah yeah
A	isn't it? So yeah
B	um
A	or just?
D	that's a lot of garlic
A	I you don't mess about with garlic
[ANNOTATION]	is load of spices or not	Neutral
B	I'd I'd only just put
A	okay
B	one or two cloves in
A	okay
B	so
A	two then
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	two colvs is okej	Entailment
A	three? Two? Three?
B	er
A	let's go three
B	how much should we?
D	push the boat out
B	yeah
D	go three
B	push the boat out
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about school	Contradiction
B	could put Tabasco in it
D	er
A	um
A	Cos we all put loads of garlic in everything
D	right
B	so basically the order doesn't really matter
A	yeah
D	um
A	oh we've actually secretly got four
A	that double one was masquerading as a single one
D	er three lemons
B	um I think
D	okay
B	I'm just subsisting on surviving on beer until um
D	it's a good way to survive
A	yeah
B	yeah it's good yeah
A	didn't monks used to drink it?
D	who?
A	or mead
B	mm
A	monks in the Middle Ages used to
D	we've got mead
B	we've got mead
A	have you?
D	yeah
A	really?
A	weird stuff isn't it
B	yeah
A	it's just made from honey
B	I quite like sweet
A	mm
B	drinks so
D	mm
A	so
A	could I
B	close to complex
A	could I feasibly
B	yeah yeah
A	to your department?
B	if you've got a recorder yeah
A	really?
B	you you do you want me to send the info to you?
A	yeah
B	yeah yeah
A	Cos I've got quite a good MP3 player with a microphone built in
B	ah
A	so
B	I'll send you the info
D	yes
A	no I garlic presses are pretty inefficient though
B	true
A	I I just like chopping it
B	fair enough
D	you can cut finer than that man honestly
A	sorry? Yeah you can get it finer than that
D	you call that chopping?
B	er basically now is just
D	I'll just open all the tins
B	put everything in a frying pan
A	okay
B	oh yeah get some tins of tomatoes out
A	yeah
D	oh no those two need a
A	get your act together
D	ah
B	are you snaffling?
D	yes
A	it'd be quite an interesting job
D	we want four tins of anchovies
A	doing the transcribing I reckon for these
B	yeah
A	Cos you must have some very strange conversations going on
B	well I
D	well our conversations are fecking weird
A	and I bet a lot of the conversations are just about the the the the thing itself
B	yeah
D	A lot of the conversations are very sort of artificial
A	yeah
D	literally
A	yeah
D	on the entire time
A	yeah
D	and that's yeah but it's very natural
A	it's high quality
D	we we we just forget it's there
B	mm
A	yeah
D	yeah
A	so do you get paid per recording? Or per hour? Or?
B	per hour of recording
A	and how how much is it per hour?
B	eighteen
A	eighteen pounds? That's really good
B	yeah
D	and tax
A	I'd
B	yeah
A	taxed? They tax it do they?
D	unfortunately
A	and how who taxes it? How is it taxed?
A	oh right
D	um well actually you wouldn't
A	I'd just
B	you you declare it on your um
A	oh er so I have to do like I have to fill in a an extra tax return for it then?
D	in theory
B	hang on you don't need four
D	we normally have two for
A	for two
D	so I was just gonna put four in
A	is
D	no
B	he said he's having a Co-op sandwich
A	A what?
B	co-op sandwich
D	although there'll probably be
A	right
D	some cheese and
A	got
D	no for cheese
A	oh cheese biscuits
D	actually we
B	there are some biscuits there
D	not many
B	there's some oat cakes and there's some of those
A	oh we've got quite a lot
D	there's virtually none of those
A	not particularly
D	oh fuck it
D	oh well
A	so what what er what exactly are you  are you  making?
B	um this is um
A	it's obviously got anchovies and garlic and tomato in it
B	anchovies
A	lemons
B	lemons
A	that sounds really good
D	it is
B	it's it's
A	it's an unusual combination as well
B	it's dead easy
D	er two er how many tomatoes
B	um three
A	it's quite
D	three
D	we've only got
D	we buy these things in bulk
B	well you say we buy them
A	why do you go to Sainsbury's? Can't you buy a similar from Morrisons?
D	um
B	we bought them when we moved in
D	we just basically stocked up
B	yeah
D	filled the entire cupboard up
A	yeah
B	which
D	er
B	means we yeah I mean we uh damn it
D	hob Brite
D	sorry
A	yeah
B	hob Brite
A	hob?
B	you cleans the hob really well
A	hob Brite
B	hob Brite
A	oh right yeah
D	tell you what
D	if you're worried
A	Cos we've got quick a similar hob in our house
B	oh
A	that's gonna go in
B	yeah
A	take ages to respond
D	no it doesn't
B	to cool it down it's quite hard
D	yeah yeah to once you've finished cooking to cool it's a pain but er
A	that's what I mean
B	yeah
D	oh no but it is actually fairly responsive to that
B	you reckon?
D	yeah
A	well it'll depend if you've got something sitting on it or not
A	I guess
D	well sort of um using sort of heat transfer the er rate of heat transfer is proportional to the temperature difference
B	oh
A	oh it'll be alright
B	never mind
B	it'll fry
A	none of us are fat
D	what the fuck's happened to that?
B	have you destroyed it?
D	huh?
B	have you ruined it?
A	just not working is it
D	ruining your mum
B	that means nothing
D	no er it does actually
B	oh yeah
D	um
B	fair enough
A	explain it for the sake of the recording device
B	yeah
B	yeah
D	it means I'm having very violent sex
B	oh
D	with her such to the point
B	oh
D	where it becomes
B	God
D	painful
B	thanks for that
A	that's the point where I'd abandon all attempts and just leave it
B	wow you really have chewed a bit in the side of that
A	sorry?
B	there's a bit gone out of the side
B	of the tin
D	I think this is going a bit
A	do you want me to er let me have a go with this one
D	okay
B	um
D	adding things
B	cooking pasta to to get ready
D	do we have er tuna?
B	er tuna yeah
D	er I'm pretty ah God actually that was quite dangerous
B	what did?
D	that sharp bit of
D	as in that was about
A	what that one?
D	that was about five mil from the vein on my wrist
B	nasty
A	nice
A	it didn't cut  it didn't cut  the skin though did it? So
D	no
A	mm
D	this
A	see that's that's good cheap cheap tuna
B	well yes
A	right
B	but no one actually looks at the price per hundred grams
A	yeah
B	that's the  that's the  key thing you see
A	I spend so long in the supermarkets looking at like
B	yeah
A	price per unit
B	yeah
A	price per gram or whatever
B	I'm really sad but you know it
A	Cos some of the  some of the  big brands are actually not as bad as you think
B	mm
A	they just  they just
B	that's true
A	sell more more or less than the most
B	mm
B	exactly
A	so as long as you can accept that
D	so um something quite funny happened at work with that
B	should I put these in?
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker D works in an office.	Neutral
D	with our laser driller
A	yeah
D	and um we got a quote which was about two quid a unit for fifty
D	and I pointed this out to them
D	Cos the quote was still valid and they were obliged to honour it
A	yeah
D	um
[ANNOTATION]	A thinks not all big brands are bad or evil.	Entailment
A	that's weird
B	that's
D	it was like how
A	they're not I don't know if you are obliged to honour a quote
D	no
A	Cos like if if a supermarket advertises something for a price and the price turns out to be completely wrong
D	no they are
A	then they then no they're not
B	well no like Tesco's advertised their iPads
A	Cos there was a  there was a  thing about um iPads
B	yeah
A	and they  and they  er just decided not to sell it for that price
D	no if actually if you pushed it you could've done that
A	no
B	I I think it's because they
[ANNOTATION]	Tesco has sold iPads in the past.	Entailment
A	no they no no
B	yeah
D	no it's er no no
B	yeah
D	no no it's a
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker D bought an iPad for their niece at Tesco.	Neutral
A	no they they can sell
D	but there's a
A	they can sell things for as whatever they want up to the point that you actually give them the money
B	yeah
A	there's no
D	not no that's not
B	okay
[ANNOTATION]	Tablets are not sold in supermarkets.	Contradiction
D	exactly how it works
B	what love?
D	well it was an interesting example
D	one of the example questions they set us was so what happens if someone puts a poster advertising a reward for a
B	decides they didn't don't care about the dog anymore
D	well no say um for example they take some of the posters down and miss one
[ANNOTATION]	A thinks that all big brands are bastards.	Contradiction
A	no
D	legally you are
A	no you're not
D	you are
A	no cos it happens all the time online
B	yeah
A	and they say oh they have to  they have to  honour the price now
D	no
A	no
D	mm
A	well I dunno
D	possibly I'm gonna go with the Oxford law professor on this one
A	right
D	um that's why a lot of so that's why you have to be very careful in the T and Cs you put with the quote
A	but you haven't  you haven't  agreed to anything
B	yeah
A	for a price
D	no
B	can I put some capers on the top?
D	I'll give you an example so it's also the reason that all quotes have um a er valid until
B	how many capers do you want?
D	um
B	lots?
D	Short answer
D	I'm gonna drain some of this
B	just fish them out
A	I
B	Don't drain it all out because
A	there was only three cloves
D	these are un-stoned aren't they?
B	they don't have stones in
D	is the expression pitted?
B	yeah but
D	yeah it is
B	um some if you  if you  say it's stoned though it's hard to know what you mean
B	like it could mean with stones or without stones
A	or it could mean
B	or it could mean yeah
A	been smoking some weed
D	oh yeah
A	oh are they  are they  er drug are they er stoners?
D	are they that way inclined? Yes
A	right
B	did you drain it all out?
D	yes
B	that's how you store them to stop them going off
D	sorry
A	oh
B	I did say to you don't drain all the water out
A	just put some olive oil
D	well it was already in the fridge
D	mm
A	Tesco sell filleted chicken chicken thighs
D	right
A	for cheaper than chicken breasts
B	yeah
A	and it's
B	which is
A	and it's by by mass it is cheaper than chicken breast
B	wow
A	it's crazy
B	yeah
A	Cos it's like
B	yeah
A	much better meat
D	mm
B	is that enough olives and capers?
D	mm
B	you think?
D	er okay
A	can I do anything else?
B	enough capers? No that's pretty much it to be honest
D	no we need some tomato purée
B	tomato purée?
D	mm
B	right
D	um
B	yeah
D	er we'll put the tomato in in a minute
B	yeah
A	so how's work going
D	um
D	well um little bit quiet at the moment
A	yeah
A	oh right
D	so that was quite
A	that's quite
D	well no I disagree with
A	yeah
D	I might be working with a project leader but it's my it's er almost how much work I choose to do on my project
A	yeah
D	um
A	yeah
D	but it's small enough such that
B	oh er pasta's done
D	we'll be doing some
B	do you wanna get the garlic breads out?
D	ooh yeah
B	oh yeah and er and there's
D	Dan would like
A	you what?
B	um there's some garlic breads in the oven
D	oh I thought we'd microwave them
A	yeah
D	whatever
A	yeah
D	so I thought okay well let's
B	there's a plate there if you want er
A	right
D	so
D	let's er let's think about ways we can make this better for people
A	right
D	so I did some came in Monday took my iPad in
A	yeah
D	and it so happened that one of um our guys was in er the States pitching to a company who would be very who would potentially be interested
A	yeah
D	so we've gotta pitch on Thursday
A	that's pretty good
D	yeah
D	literally came up with this idea off the er top of my head
A	yeah
D	on Sunday
A	mm
D	by Thursday it was being presented to one of the biggest pharmaceutical companies in the States
A	that's quite good isn't it
B	um
D	er it's like because it's small you get that opportunity
A	yeah
D	and
B	cool
D	okay
B	oh
A	why stinging? Have you got a cut on your finger or something?
D	apparently so
A	oh
D	it's a good way to find out if you've got a cut on your finger really isn't it
A	I'll do it if you want
D	er yeah
A	although I've got I've definitely got a cut on my thumb so
B	should I squeeze them?
D	oh you'll squeeze them  you'll squeeze them  good
B	what?
B	again
D	ah
A	if you think about it you could like really artificially do one of these er one of these recordings and just like deliberately make the whole thing full of innuendo
A	or like completely mislead someone and only reveal reveal at the end
A	what you're actually talking about is something completely innocent and
B	yeah
D	well what amused me was the idea of um we had it on in the car
A	yeah
B	yeah
D	or what you could do if you could actually kid somebody into thinking you'd had an accident
B	yeah
D	yep
A	well
D	no
B	it er well
D	not unless they're responding to an emergency and on blues and twos
B	he was just driving yeah I mean he might have forgotten to put his
D	they have to be either training
B	siren out
D	or on blues
D	well you might turn a siren off at night in a residential area
B	is anyone any good at serving spaghetti?
D	pursuing a
A	have you  have you  got a spaghetti server?
B	we haven't got a spaghetti server
D	uh
B	I know
A	er just
B	and a fork
A	just tip it
B	just tip it?
A	yeah
D	A server
A	A fork might be
B	yeah
D	um
B	uh
D	um
B	yeah
D	um
A	I'm gonna have a go at this
A	you're not doing it right
D	oh I'm sorry
A	I'll
A	I'll leave it there
A	there's probably quite a lot of lemon juice in there now anyway
B	oh
A	what's that? Cinnamon?
D	mm
B	oh
D	you didn't put purée in did you?
B	no
D	oh
B	I thought you had
D	no
B	oh
D	we could put it in now the purée
A	where's the purée? Fridge?
B	it's here
D	there
A	oh you've got it
B	we did get it out ready
A	oh
D	yeah yeah
A	mm
A	more tomatoey
B	more?
D	can you yeah can you do it low enough so so it's not spraying everywhere?
D	okay
A	so when they transcribe this conversation
B	yeah
A	do they sort of write it out as if it was a play? So like person A this
B	yeah
A	person B
B	so like the first person to speak's number one
A	oh I see
B	and whenever they speak again they're number one
A	yeah
B	um
A	yeah
B	that gets a little tag round it
A	ah
B	and if somebody uses a word
D	this is really
B	that isn't real
A	yeah
B	this is what? Really what?
D	this
A	so uses a word that isn't real er
B	so as in like if or if if they say like um if someone's a non-native speaker and they use a word slightly wrong
A	right
B	there's a little tag to go they they meant this so that they can
A	so it's like
B	still search it for sense
A	putting brackets sic
B	yeah
A	or
B	yeah
A	ah
B	which is quite good
A	and what about um like obscenities? Do they  do they  censor it at all? Or?
B	no no
A	do they censor
B	um yeah
A	yeah or like  or something
B	but like first names
A	yeah
B	and like I said er you wouldn't ever be searching for a first name
A	yeah
B	right
A	he's gone
B	oh well
A	feel like having some of this wine with it
B	sorry
A	feel like having some of this wine with it
B	yeah yeah
A	have you got some wine-glasses?
B	we've got some excellent wine-glasses
A	oh they're huge
B	they're massive aren't they
A	wow
B	um
B	pardon?
D	let's not make it sound better than it is
B	the Daily Mail wine club
A	it's a what?
B	the Daily Mail yeah
A	the Daily Mail wine
B	do you wanna serve
D	which one's my beer?
A	that sounds like the worst organization in the world
D	which one's my beer?
A	I'm not gonna lie
B	um
A	the colder one
B	yeah
A	that one
D	yep
B	um
D	no
B	rubbish at serving pasta
A	the Daily Mail wine club?
B	well apparently it's quite decent for
D	yeah
A	do they read The Daily Mail as well?
D	no
D	can you not insult them like that? Er it's
A	well I
A	I thought I'd better ask that in case you said yes you know
B	and then you'd be like oh
A	but how
D	well
B	Cos they hear about it from one of their
D	how do you
A	one of their
B	daily Mail reader friends
D	how do you prove you read The Daily Mail?
B	well as in like how did they find out about it? How good it was
A	mm
A	naturally
B	he's quite into his Which?
A	yeah
B	my dad was like
D	your dad was very
A	gonna sit here
B	yeah
A	is that okay?
B	that's fine
A	I'm not like stealing
B	sit anywhere
A	your your own seat or anything?
B	no no
A	hmm
B	okay
A	do we all want a glass of wine?
B	yeah
A	as well as the glass of beer we've got  we've got
B	yeah
A	I don't mind
D	I'm just gonna down mine in a minute
A	although I've
B	yeah
A	it's
B	yeah
A	without even realizing
B	it er it's yeah
D	you don't
B	you never have a glass of wine because a glass of wine's a bottle of wine
A	yeah
B	so you always just have a little bit in the bottom
A	yeah
D	yeah cos the formal wine-glass you just get through in a few seconds
B	so it works quite well
A	wow
A	in just
B	yeah
A	three very
B	it was quite small the glasses
A	got er quarter full glasses
A	that's incredible
B	they are mental
D	fantastic
B	they do the job
D	they're like they'd normally probably be about twenty quid a glass
A	right
D	we got eight of them for free
A	mm
B	I'm not sure I'm gonna eat it all
D	that's what your mum says
A	these mats are pretty cool
B	well we ordered them and then six weeks later we were like um can we have our mats? And they were like well you know
D	yeah
B	we did say
D	so they made this place in Wales does them
A	oh right
D	it's er cos John Lewis had like slate mats but they weren't very nice
A	right
D	bluey grey
A	they are pretty nice
D	Cos
A	right
D	um
B	okay
D	er should we get some more
B	some more
D	yes
B	huh
D	uh
A	oh thank you
B	uh
A	this looks really good
D	well actually

D	no
B	he was the year below
A	oh I think it's
B	possibly
D	can't imagine they have much in common
A	I think it's
B	yeah he's quite artsy
A	right
B	she was two years below
A	oh right
B	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A knew his name but nothing more.	Entailment
D	we were on the same corridor in fourth year
[ANNOTATION]	Their rooms were close once.	Entailment
B	your fourth year?
D	well yes obviously
A	presumably she's in not even in her fourth year yet?
B	no she's on her year abroad
A	oh right
B	I think
A	mm
D	as a linguist
A	yep
D	mm
[ANNOTATION]	She is a mechanic who doesn't care about languages.	Contradiction
B	is there anything else you do a year abroad for?
D	sorry?
B	guess there isn't
D	er no engineers can
B	okay
D	but we actually spend a year studying
D	well no objectively she's not really studying
B	she is
D	she's attending a few courses
[ANNOTATION]	She has not stopped going to courses.	Entailment
A	I think  I think  it's incredibly difficult doing a year abroad
A	it's a whole year
D	well she's studying German as a foreign language in Italy in Italian
A	yeah
B	mm
D	er I agree that's hard but it's not like
B	and in all fairness she doesn't know you know that's er
[ANNOTATION]	She chose going to Italy because of the beautiful language.	Neutral
A	yeah
D	mm
D	it it's it's she's got a pretty good ratio
A	right
D	going on I think you could quite honestly say
B	still
D	mm
A	mm
D	I'm not sure really
D	oh actually last night you'll never guess where we went
A	no I wouldn't
D	so the type of restaurant that we went to
B	mm
A	was it um Mongolian?
D	close
A	really? What geographically close? Or?
D	um sort of
A	just in terms of obscurity?
B	mm
D	er in terms of obscurity something more obscure
A	was it um North Korean?
D	um close in terms of political leanings
A	oh really?
D	yep
A	was it like um
B	well
B	as in mental you mean?
D	mm
B	rather than as in
A	as in being mental?
D	yeah
B	not similar
A	was it like Iranian or something?
D	yeah
B	yep
A	really?
A	mm
B	um in Hills Road
D	we were just walking past and thought nice
B	it does a lot of stuff that
D	let's try that
A	what sort of food was it?
B	A lot of it's similar to Greek
A	Don't say Iranian
B	so so like a lot of it is um
A	yeah
B	so either different names for hummus and Taramosalata
D	well they're slightly different
B	tzatziki
D	yeah
B	and pitta breads
A	yeah
B	and you can get things like baklava and kleftiko and stuff
D	I was
A	I love baklava
B	mm
D	mm
B	it was really good
D	Saffron ice cream
A	mm
D	that was special
B	and I had Persian tea
A	mm
D	and there was a really nice delicious like it's not lots of herbs and stuff like
B	mm
D	very gently spiced
A	mm
D	hot at all
B	yeah
D	mm
B	you know
A	mm
B	and he said it's just like herbs
A	mm
B	and it's not spicy
D	mm
A	mm
D	it was gently impressive
A	mm
B	but
A	mm
B	yeah like we were just walking past
A	yeah
B	you know
D	actually Loch Fyne was full
B	yeah
A	we need to go to some of er some more random restaurants down there
D	mm
A	Cos there are loads of them aren't there
D	yeah
B	mm
D	well there's that one where we went with
A	that was awesome
D	I know
A	that was so good
B	I really wanna go there
D	but I think
A	was that Seven Days or something?
D	yeah
B	yeah
D	but I think it was better as a big group
A	and with someone who's Chinese
A	who knows what to order
D	mm
B	hmm
D	Cos my um having had a Chinese ex-girlfriend helped
A	mm
D	and that was it
B	ooh
D	oh yeah
B	he knows er yeah so um
A	yep
B	and they cooked this amazing Chinese feast
A	yeah
B	basically
D	apparently duck feet oh chicken feet
A	mm
B	chicken feet's a big thing
A	I had chicken feet in Thailand
B	were they good? Cos they they said they would cook them for us
A	no they were stupid
A	it's just
B	yeah
A	mostly bone and sinew and stuff
B	yeah
A	I don't really know what the point in them is
A	mm
B	like surely that's just pointless
A	must be really small
B	yeah
D	it's probably a delicacy
B	the beak is quite small
D	you know caviar slightly odd thing to eat but
B	oh that's true I guess
D	you know people er
B	Don't really like it
D	Don't really like it
A	very good thank you
D	mm
A	it's an interesting flavour combination
D	but nice
A	yeah
D	mm
A	yeah it works really well
B	I like cinnamon in it I think
A	Cos normally I put cinnamon in sweet stuff
B	mm
A	I've never really put it in like savoury stuff before
D	mm
B	it's really good in moussaka as well
D	it balances the lemon as well
A	mm
B	it is quite an easy way of getting quite a lot of food
A	we've got um got a slow cooker in our house
B	mm
A	we've all started using this slow cooker recently
D	not for meat please
A	not for what?
D	not for meat
A	yeah of course
D	oh God
A	slow cooked chicken is fantastic
D	oh er chicken okay
A	slow cooked meat is very very different to er
A	that'd be ridiculous
D	fine
A	you know
B	mm
A	and you've gotta sort of get that in your head first
A	I mean it
A	like braising steak
B	mm
A	well it's when it once you've slow cooked it for like ten hours it just
A	falls apart and it's really really tasty
B	yeah we could do that
D	mm
D	how does it work?
A	er I I agree like I wasn't sold on it
B	mm
A	er er er either
B	no you
A	make some really
D	mm
A	when it's been cooking like slowly for ten hours
B	so you just you
D	the the problem is
B	some wine and some stuff
A	mm
B	um herbs and spices and whatever and
A	yeah
D	that's essentially a marinade
A	well er
B	yeah but it cooks it though
A	not really
B	so
A	you just marinade is like before you cook it you soak it in some sauce or something don't you
D	yes and you
B	yes but it's basically the meat is cooking in the sauce for
D	the point is it takes it into the structure
A	yeah
B	yeah
D	so but does the slow cooker do the same? Or is it just on the surface?
B	well
A	what do you mean on the surface?
D	mm
B	well it's in the sauce for that long
A	it's just a slow cooker is just like a huge pot
D	right
A	that warms up to maybe you know eighty or ninety degrees and sits there for eight hours
B	you put it on in the morning
A	you put it on in the morning
B	and you come back for your dinner
A	and you come back and
B	yeah
A	you eat it in the evening
D	actually I'm sceptical about casseroles and stews because you er well for example your mother
D	has this knack of ruining perfectly nice meat
B	mm
D	by stewing it for hours
A	right
B	but she also cooks everything
A	hmm
A	yeah
A	for like the last fifteen minutes or something
B	yeah
D	not if you're her mother
B	I had someone who had some
A	well I made a  I made a  Thai curry in there and it was actually really good
B	yeah
A	for Thai curries
B	mm
A	it's pretty nice
B	I had something er was it  was it  neck? It think it was lamb neck that she'd bought
A	and stuff like lentils as well
B	mm
A	but if you just put them in
D	I'm not a lentil fan
B	true
A	I like lentils
B	mm
A	I think they're really good
B	mm
A	lentils and meat is a winner
D	I always thought lentils were a carbohydrate source
A	they are
B	you're just biased cos your dad's a massive lentil fan
D	mm I
A	me?
D	mm
A	no
D	mm
A	but a few you know er a few people in my house live sort of almost live vegetarian
D	mm?
A	I'd like to I don't  I don't wanna be I don't  wanna be
D	why?
A	Cos I just think ecologically it's more of a sustainable way of eating
D	fair enough
B	mm
A	you sound quite you look quite upset my that Pete
D	I'm not upset
A	it's just I er just it's just a standard food chain argument of if we wanted to feed everyone it would we could feed them much more efficiently if we
A	didn't raise crops on huge areas of land
A	balanced crops instead
B	mm
D	or alternatively if we want to feed everyone we should just use bloody GM and stop whinging about it
A	no I also agree with that
A	I do agree with that
D	er that's something that really fucks me off when you get these very sort of very middle class anti GM people and oh
B	yeah
D	yes you can afford
B	you yeah
D	food can't you
A	yeah
D	so get out of the way
A	no  no I agree  I agree completely
D	mm
A	mm
D	yeah
A	mm
D	who's having a go at GM it's yep
D	ah
A	but I think you'll find that third world countries don't generally object to GM
B	mm
A	it's generally middle class people in in
D	yeah
A	no that's not to say that isn't a real thing though
D	no indeed but it's it's very mm
B	hmm
D	not
A	mm
D	yeah
A	and it should be taken seriously
D	mm
A	yeah
B	but yeah on on
A	mm
D	mm
B	crops that have had any chemicals or
D	because
B	yeah
D	I mean I don't understand how stupid these people are
D	genetically modified in some way shape or form
A	yeah cos it's been selectively bred
B	yeah
D	exactly
D	sorry
B	oh
D	yep
B	with the Waitrose set
D	but it's interesting actually
A	waitrose is a good good supermarket though
B	I've never shopped there
D	I don't it's good for some things
A	one of my housemates occasionally goes
B	okay
A	but it's really good
B	yeah?
D	it's not good for fruit and veg I've found
A	mm
D	like for fresh produce it's not very good
A	it's good  it's good  for red meat
B	oh okay
A	they have really good steaks and burgers and stuff
B	mm
D	mm
A	their burgers are really really nice
D	oh yeah actually my mum gets those
A	right
D	really
B	they're
A	we er  we er  we kind of
A	burgers
B	mm
A	and we did Co-op nice burgers
D	I could've predicted that possibly
A	but the Co-op were nicer than the Tesco
B	okay
A	which was interesting
B	mm
D	you can
B	you get steak and chips and
A	what what for ten pounds sorry?
B	er two dine for ten pounds
A	oh is that in their
A	take out meal thing
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	so you get like a main course a side dish a dessert and a bottle of wine
A	right
B	for ten quid
A	oh that's good
B	which is really good
D	steak chips nice bottle of wine
A	the bottle of wine makes it
B	yeah
A	quite a nice deal
D	well the wine's normally six quid by itself
A	mm
B	if you don't drink wine it's not so good
A	mm
B	so
D	mm
D	Don't know if I ever listen to it
A	I think it was the only full album you had on that iPod I think
D	that's really not true
A	no the only full Stereophonics album
D	oh yeah yeah
A	not like but
A	also there aren't very many
B	I snuck this on you
A	full albums on there
B	I
A	Cos I went through all the um I went on er the artists thing and I went in all the artists that I really like and there's generally like one song in there
A	rather than an album
D	I've got quite a lot of compilation albums
A	mm
D	um
A	right
B	mm
D	brilliant work-out music
B	hmm
D	that's quite good driving music if you're tired
D	it's really good music though
B	mm
D	as in er it's not just screaming white noise
B	yeah
D	well the lyrics for example
B	yeah
D	do kind of make sense
B	if that's the best you can say
D	well no as in a lot of metal's just random shite
D	I mean if you listen to Rage Against the Machine it's just nonsense what they're saying
A	no I disagree with that
B	I've never listened to enough of it to make a judgement
D	er
B	I've only really heard
A	I don't agree with their politics but er I think there's a
D	to
A	no they're not really
D	to quote from  But the
A	they're a bit more sophisticated than that
D	I'm not well it's I only have one of their songs in all fairness
D	which is
A	at least there
B	yeah
A	like it's just
B	I know what you mean
A	it's just generic and
B	it doesn't mean anything
A	boring
D	yep
B	yeah
D	this is a sign of aging
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about party	Contradiction
A	I know
B	I'm getting into my folk music
A	it's the
B	yeah
A	and then Radio 4
B	oh
A	a few years ago for me
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about book	Contradiction
D	you see that happened to me about
A	mm
D	simultaneously with puberty
A	mm
B	when you stopped going to school discos you discovered Radio 4
D	er well yeah I
D	never actually went through puberty
A	the thing is like
[ANNOTATION]	person B is talking about Radio 4	Entailment
A	um
D	oh
A	we sort of grew up in the nineties
B	yeah
A	but I was still too young in the early nineties to appreciate the music at the time
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about a film	Contradiction
B	yeah
A	and that is the music now
B	we were around but
A	that I
B	mm
D	what is grunge?
A	it's like the music that came out of Seattle in the nineties
D	oh Nirvana
A	pearl Jam
D	okay
[ANNOTATION]	person A is talking about music	Entailment
A	and people like Silverchair and well Pearl Jam are still going as well
B	mm
D	I I literally know Nirvana out of that lot
A	right
D	but okay
A	but that is just my sort of I just  I just  love it
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about weather	Contradiction
B	yeah
A	like like there isn't anything else now
B	yeah
A	it's just it just kind of suits me so well
B	mm
D	you see I still enjoy
B	you'll listen to anything
D	sorry?
B	you'll listen to anything
D	yeah
D	and like I will um my iPod is varied if nothing else

D	no the first album's pretty good
A	who the hell's Hilary Duff?
D	she's a she she was
B	she's God awful
D	a sort of American pop sorry a teenage sort of a bit like
B	I hate everything she stands for
D	so a bit like
A	what does she stand for sorry?
B	she's blonde
D	so she
B	and American and thirteen and
D	so she's a bit like um sort Lindsay Lohan
A	oh right
D	not she's a sort of
B	she's Selina Gomez and all that
A	right
B	oh no she was um

A	I'd like I'm not sure what I'd like to listen to but I'm interested to know

D	completely different and awful
A	well
B	what was the programme called? Lizzie McGuire
A	right
B	um and you know like Disney Channel type thing
A	mm
B	then she became a singer
D	no she was a singer first
B	she wasn't
D	hey

D	to my knowledge she hasn't got any massive well not that I would know about this but it's never
B	she's vile
D	been sort of publicized as having some massive drug habits or
B	she's vile
B	she's just
A	she'd seem more genuine then?
B	yeah
B	she you know she I just you know
D	so by vile you mean she's
A	all the best singers eventually develop drug habits
B	yeah
D	oh
A	it is true though
B	I'd respect her more as an artist
A	it is true
B	it is true

A	oh yeah but he's still like put botox in his face
A	that's not particularly clean
D	hmm
A	well maybe it is
D	uh
A	probably kills bacteria
A	I think I feel I should
D	and and sells
A	I feel I need to educate you on um the nineties grunge movement now

D	he's
A	I don't really appreciate him

A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	it is very funny	Entailment

A	mm
D	but was never actually sort of cos I was sort of surprised about seeing one stand-up comedian who was bizarrely it was on um you remember GCSE English verse and anthology?

D	yeah
B	I've paid twenty-five quid and you haven't even
D	he
B	bothered to come up with some jokes
D	and he'd give the occasional chuckle but
B	he annoyed me a bit
D	no I don't wanna pay good money to be gently
A	I went
D	amused
A	I went to see um
A	do you know  do you know
D	yes
A	you know who he is right?

B	oh right
A	as I say I've heard of him now but I hadn't before
A	and they had
A	jokes and stuff
B	yeah
A	it was very very funny
B	did you have to be quite into your science? Or was it just funny?
A	well it er helped if you knew a little bit about science
B	mm
A	but it wasn't it was all kind of aimed at the layman anyway so it was
B	yeah yeah
A	you got a bit more of it some of the jokes um
B	hmm
A	but most it was most like
B	right
A	it was like why particle physics is like sex
A	for like half an hour
B	nice
A	that's essentially all he talked about
A	but it was really good
[ANNOTATION]	Particle physics is similar to eating food.	Contradiction
B	it sounds good
A	yeah
B	mm
D	yeah
B	hmm
A	I am sure
A	none of us would find that very funny though
D	no you
A	you might find it that funny
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A doesn't think it would be really funny.	Entailment
D	yeah
B	that's a  that's a  bit more
D	there's a very select
B	specialized
A	quite niche niche
B	yeah
D	target audience
A	yeah
D	yeah
A	mm
D	oh huh
[ANNOTATION]	The audience consists of all kinds of people.	Contradiction
B	mm
D	yeah I didn't think you were gonna get through that
D	see I've got a clean plate
B	you licked yours
A	I might finish
B	yes er does any if anyone actually wants some pasta like
A	I might have this as well
B	do you  do you  want the pasta?
A	yeah
B	you er do you want?
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A wants the chicken.	Contradiction
A	I'll finish your I'll finish yours
B	yeah yeah
A	off if you're not gonna finish it
[ANNOTATION]	The pasta is spaghetti.	Neutral
B	I'm full
A	thank you
B	we have got
A	I hope you don't  I hope you don't  find that rude
B	no no it's it was it would've gone in the bins
A	er I just tend to finish
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B doesn't like to throw food away.	Neutral
B	so yeah just
A	I just tend to finish other people's food if they don't finish it that's all
B	go for it
D	um
A	mm
A	I didn't say that
D	yeah
B	yeah
D	thinking
B	could've been dreadful
A	even if it wasn't you know I probably would've eaten it
A	but it is
B	mm
D	er something else
B	what do you want?
D	everwood soundtrack?
B	ah
D	that's got Stereophonics on it
B	it hasn't
A	what did you say to put on?
D	it has got
B	it hasn't
D	is it Travis?
B	Travis are on it
D	I thought they were
B	oh yes it has
A	to what?
B	sorry it
D	thank you
B	what do they sing? Oh First Time Ever I Saw oh I hate that song
A	soundtrack to what?
D	everwood
B	it's not really comedy drama
D	it's very funny
B	it's funny but it's not really a comedy drama
D	it's er it's a drama series
B	mm
D	it the central characters are a very um sort of world-leading brain surgeon who is a workaholic in New York until his wife dies
B	she no she's younger than that
D	well er
B	anyway
D	out to
B	she's er a young girl
D	this small town in Colorado where he sets up a free medical practice
A	mm
D	and er it's their adventures or misadventures
A	mm
B	it's um it's er it's really good
D	mm
B	all a bit kind of grief-stricken
D	I thought you said hates hits sorry
B	no no
D	rather than hate
B	so he he hates his dad and it's it's all quite um quite good
D	but it's not as cheesy as you make it sound
B	no
D	it's actually very good
B	but it's really good
A	okay
D	um and it's really good cos they always have like every episode has a subplot which is a medical dilemma but and it's got to deal with like an ethical thing
A	mm
D	er so there's you know a very obvious one on abortion which was fascinating
B	it's like Casualty but good
A	right
D	er but it's really interesting cos they never actually come down on a side
A	mm
D	it's like what is the right thing to do here?
A	mm
D	um
A	mm
B	it's very gentle and nice but also
D	it's not
B	no as in it's it's kind of fun to watch
A	mm
B	like it's not harrowing and horrible
D	some of it is
B	some of it is
D	mm
A	the most harrowing and horrible TV show
B	er the yeah
A	ever devised by man
B	oh it's excellent
D	the most attractive man on God's earth
B	yeah
A	I've seen it once in Pete's room when I was in er
A	my second year or third year or something
A	must've been third year
D	mm
B	we sort of bought it as a bit of a joke
A	he didn't buy it he's er he doesn't look like he bought it as a joke
D	no no I just because
B	well
D	we were curious
B	yeah we we go oh look it's Richard off Friends
D	it was eight pounds in Smiths
A	mm
D	and we were on holiday and thought well it will give us something to watch
A	right
D	but it's
D	but it's got Magnum in it
B	who's just amazing
A	was he the guy with the moustache right?
B	yeah
D	he's the only man I've ever met who's got better legs than I have
D	sorry I've seen
D	um
B	oh that would be good
A	I've got better legs than you have
D	oh no
A	far better
B	oh dear
A	A leg off
B	does sound
B	I think it will be pretty bad
B	you lot getting tape measures out
B	look
B	it's not
B	it's it's not gonna make for a good evening really
A	and it's being recorded
B	yeah
B	I think you should settle this and agree that you've both got equally excellent legs
D	I don't think we'll ever agree that
A	I think we'll just
B	no
A	we'll just have to agree to settle it at some other point
B	fair enough
A	we need like an an an a um impartial third party
A	to er to judge it as well
B	I'm not sure
D	no
B	he'd probably object to that
D	particularly the last bit of my legs
A	as soon as you come to the door
A	you've gotta
A	you've gotta tell us what you think about these legs
B	you two standing with no trousers on
A	I think he might run away
B	yeah
D	that's er that's quite funny
B	in all fair that's what you did to get try and get rid of um
D	no
A	to who?
D	um
A	oh
D	yes
A	really?
D	well we were trying to have quite a private conversation
A	yeah
D	and
A	mm
D	and you couldn't you know we were  we were  trying to hint um yeah actually we're chatting here and
A	mm
D	and er we just got to right okay we'll go back to your well
D	would not leave us alone
A	right
D	so we ended up saying yeah we're going back to have sex now
A	oh God
B	poor
[ANNOTATION]	Person B feel petty for Person D's friend	Contradiction
A	so you he probably thought you were actually gonna have sex
B	mm
A	he just probably did just didn't get it at all
B	yeah
B	think so yeah
B	mean to him
D	yeah he didn't believe us until we were down to boxers
D	did leave
B	and then you put your clothes back on
A	what is he  what is he  doing now? Do you know?

D	no but that no that's when we continued our conversation in the buff
B	he's doing a PhD
A	is he?
D	he spent a year
D	yeah
A	right
D	I don't think he sort of got on with it and
A	right
D	came back to do a PhD
A	in where? Where is he?
A	oh
[ANNOTATION]	Person A wants to know that where he gonna back for PhD	Entailment
B	well we met him in John Lewis

B	didn't come
D	er actually no we invited him to that party
D	you were in Australia
D	yeah
B	he'd wrecked his
A	was it a house-warming party?
[ANNOTATION]	Person A is going to dance	Contradiction
B	yeah
D	yeah

[ANNOTATION]	Person D is happy to get an icecream	Contradiction
D	Cos he did seem really keen
A	oh he would've come
D	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
D	it was a very good night actually
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Person A was happy that he would come in that night	Entailment

D	actually no I've seen him er getting into his car
A	right
B	mm
A	yeah
B	yeah
D	that's it
D	oh we tried we

B	such a uh
D	such a fucking
A	mm
D	all the students coming down
A	going home?
B	yeah
D	yeah
B	so it was just full of parents
D	so there was
A	yeah
D	nowhere to park
B	and we got so held up going in
D	then got to
A	yeah
D	oh yeah
A	it's that weekend isn't it
B	yeah
A	mind you this time last year I think I
B	yeah
A	well I went home for a weekend I think but
B	yes
A	that actually wasn't a bad Easter
B	mm
A	revising the whole time
B	mm
A	quite relaxing somehow
B	yeah
A	and the weather was even though the weather like normally you think if the weather's great
B	mm
A	you don't wanna be revising
B	I quite like it
A	no one else was there anyway
B	yeah
A	so you couldn't exactly like play football with anyone
B	yeah yeah
A	Cos there was no one to play football with so
B	so you
A	yeah I was in the library
B	weather to go for a walk
A	and it was nice to look out and see the sunshine
B	yeah
A	so it was actually alright
B	quite like that
A	but we had a really hot April last year
D	mhm
A	it was like ludicrously hot
B	yeah it was this year
D	oh I'm looking forward to the summer
B	and then it was cold the rest of the summer
A	yeah it was horrible
D	when
A	to be stuck in a library for
D	yeah
A	right
D	er
A	I think er probably not
D	no
A	right
D	and then a solo one next year
A	you haven't told me about that
D	er well yes that that was the aim
D	er
A	mm
D	I think
A	mm
D	but um the point being it's still one of my training goals
A	who's the other person?
D	um
A	no don't know who he is
D	er if you met him you'd remember
A	mm
D	um
A	right
D	yeah
A	right
D	um
A	mm
D	um
B	in what sense?
D	well for example he's pissed against the outside wall of the bar
B	yep
D	um
B	so did you have a night out with him and you remember it
D	I don't think through a window
D	oh no sorry it was the it was the flower bed under a staircase
D	just between there and the bar
B	nice
D	he's the only person I've ever known who's taken a leak inside
A	there must be others though
B	oh there would've been others
A	yeah
B	probably fellows
A	yeah lecturers have done that
B	lecturers have done that
B	I can see that happening
D	he's got a  he's got a  room in A so you know
D	yeah
B	has he?
D	yeah
B	oh
D	study
B	okay
D	um
B	actually no but
D	actually no
D	staircase
A	yeah
D	the funny thing was he was
B	depends how pissed you are
D	probably pissing against the outside wall of a toilet
D	he could've just walked
B	God
A	must've been desperate
B	what can you do?
D	he must've been hammered
A	mm
B	yeah
D	um
A	well unfortunately I won't be here this summer so I won't can't er can't volunteer to do your cross channel craziness
B	and you're not mental so yeah
D	sure you don't?
A	I'm not mental either
A	I can swim but I don't swim really so
D	sure you don't feel like it?
A	not really
B	fair enough
D	it's a great
A	I don't know that's for you we we me and you have very different definitions of strength
D	well as in er you're using pretty much all of your body's muscles for a long time
A	but I
B	mm
D	one helps the other
A	yeah you do get  you do get  some from but the most effective way to get stronger is to lift heavier weights
D	I think a lot of people would
A	the definition of strength is how much you can lift
D	I think er
B	yeah it it depends how you define it exactly yeah
D	in all fairness though er
A	but sprint trainers always do heavy weights
D	mm
A	sprinters do have very strong legs I admit
D	but er
A	definitely
D	er yeah
B	yeah
D	does come it's not all from the weights
A	but that's more power rather than strength
D	subtle distinction
D	but alright
A	no there is a  there is a  distinction though
B	mm
A	Cos power is effectively how fast you can lift the weight
[ANNOTATION]	speaker d is a sprinter	Neutral
B	hmm
A	er it's that is how it's manifested really
D	okay
D	um
[ANNOTATION]	there is a difference between power and strength	Entailment
A	and that's why power lifting is
B	yeah
A	not about how fast you can lift the weight
D	um
B	interesting
D	mm
A	but yeah
A	sprinters do a lot of weight training cos it's good for sprinting
B	mm
A	A lot of power-related sprinter training as well like fast explosive
D	mhm
A	sort of er squats and things
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	training with weights is not good for athletes who sprint	Contradiction
D	um
A	yeah I don't really swim very much though
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b finds speaker a's explanations to be interesting	Entailment
B	huh
A	I can swim about last time I went swimming I did about  I did about  one or two lengths and I was completely exhausted
B	swimming's really knackering
A	like I'm not unfit you know
A	I can play football and I can run reasonable reasonable distances
B	shall I er
D	okay
D	um
A	but good luck with
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a is fit	Entailment
B	thank you
A	your er thank you
A	attempt
D	mm
A	it's quite adventurous that
D	well yeah er it I love swimming in open water and I'm pretty resistant to cold
A	yeah
D	so between the two it's seemed like quite
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a could do ten lengths swimming without getting tired	Contradiction
A	are you gonna grease yourself up for it?
D	there's two schools of thought on that
A	are you gonna wear like a huge
D	no no you can't
A	really?
D	um
D	er apparently one of the main advantages is protection from jellyfish stings
A	oh really?
D	yeah
A	oh that's interesting
D	well it's the initial thermal shock and then the jellyfish protection
A	yeah
D	so I'm pretty
D	mm
B	yeah
A	interesting
D	yeah
A	yeah
D	however
A	what are these things?
D	minions
D	you haven't seen the film Despicable Me have you?
A	I don't think so
D	er
A	despicable Me?
D	yeah
A	is it a Pixar film?
A	it might be Dreamworks then or something
B	it's I think it's Dreamworks
A	right
D	brilliant film
A	right
D	um it well it's actually it's er it's  a children's film in principle um but it's brilliant
D	this super-villain Gru
A	right
D	hence the G
A	okay
D	um
B	he tries not to be likeable at the beginning
D	and he's trying to he's being a bit old and a bit past it and there's this sort of younger villain called um
A	oh hang on
B	called Vector
D	called Vector
A	I have seen it
D	attitude and direction
A	is he  is he
D	no
B	no he's
D	that no that's Megamind
B	oh that's Megamind
A	oh I mean er Megamind
B	it's kind of similar
A	it's the same it sounds the same like
D	it's
A	a villain who's not really a villain
D	er yeah
B	yeah
D	it's a very similar concept only
A	Megamind's quite funny
B	Megamind's good
D	yeah this is subtly better
A	right
D	er
A	no I haven't definitely haven't seen this then
D	okay um tut what I suggest is if I go and print the maps out and work out where the hell we're actually going tomorrow
D	I'm just gonna pack kit in the morning since we've got a bit more time now
B	yeah
D	well rucksack
B	yeah but as in it's not gonna take hours to pack
A	it's just lunch right? Isn't it? And
B	oh yeah I'll make lunch tonight I think
D	um
A	that's fine
D	I'll also ring
B	you could put
D	yeah indeed
B	with his dating er
D	well I also need the details for this walk
B	oh yeah
D	so er
A	oh I saw something printed out
D	yeah
A	okay
D	er a while ago
A	yeah
D	er I called him while I was in you know but it's non-stop so they'll complete it in about sixteen hours
A	yeah
D	um it's a charity thing
A	right
D	well they could to to be fair but
D	they're not
A	mm
D	er which should be fun
A	me and um
D	oh yes
A	did I tell you about it? It's like a twelve um
D	the website's bizarre
A	it's a twelve mile endurance course with obstacles and er
D	you? Endurance?
A	on fire and yeah I can run
A	I love endurance
A	it's not just just er running it's you know carry they make you carry logs and stuff as well
A	and er climb over big tall things and get electrocuted
B	sounds quite manly
A	yeah
D	you know it's er essentially that's what all my training focus is on
A	yeah
D	um as in it was sort of er initially focused around army endurance and just
A	I love
A	twice
D	that's not endurance
B	oh
A	that is endurance
B	that made a really cool noise
D	um
A	no I don't think they say that
D	I think it it well no I think um yeah you have to have a very you need to be a good marathon runner you need like like if you lined up a load of runners I could spot the marathon runners
D	no upper body strength
D	basically you need to be as light as possible
B	oh you can put that on the hob if you want
D	but um I dunno it's just like some of the obstacles like running through an electrified field
A	yeah
A	why not?
D	like er like some of the things are just like if they just took like a military assault course fine
A	so why are you er why aren't you keen to have it inflicted on you for no good reason?
D	well no there has to be a good reason for it though
B	you're willing to put up with pain
D	ooh it's
A	I think it's quite fun
B	oh
B	oh it's
A	er do we need to load this
B	um it's loaded
A	okay
B	um you can dry maybe if you  if you  want
A	yeah
B	er
A	where's the dryer?
B	tea towel on there
A	should I move the dirties over to that side?
B	um I'm yeah
B	um
B	cool
D	oh huh
C	it was alright
B	they've been rowing in er
A	oh has he?
B	he has
A	that's the one in London right? Thames?
B	yeah yeah
C	during our race
B	um yeah
A	did
B	yeah
A	just cos
A	just funny
B	yeah
A	couldn't
B	well his dad's retired and sort of looking for jobs
A	sorry?
B	er
C	oh you had fish?
A	yeah
C	ugh
[ANNOTATION]	Person C love fish	Contradiction
A	Don't you like fish
C	ugh
B	anchovies
C	smell to walk into
B	anchovies and tuna
C	no
B	really good
C	no
B	it's a good job you weren't here
[ANNOTATION]	Person B invite Person c to join him	Contradiction
C	not my favourite food
B	aw
C	instead
[ANNOTATION]	Fish is not Person's C favorite meal	Entailment
B	oh well
C	it was very nice
A	how are you doing?
C	alright
A	Good
C	finally er got my hands on some actual design
A	oh excellent
C	er it's nothing um spectacular
A	right
C	to er
B	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Person B doesn't is thinking of what Person a and C are talking about	Entailment
C	so this is a pumping station
A	yeah
C	site
A	yeah
C	each with two pumps in
C	between kiosks
C	one has to go underneath the access road
B	so
[ANNOTATION]	Person B it gonna say something about the pumping station	Neutral
C	fucking big thing though
A	what the whole the the cavity itself?
C	the
A	oh the trough?
C	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Person C try to figure out what is the big thing	Neutral
A	yeah
C	the whole
A	oh right
C	um
B	so did you get it wrong with the
C	yes
A	get it right
B	yeah
C	no but
B	fall into the trough
C	the
C	and er yeah
B	excellent
C	um
B	in a road
C	not that many weeks' time I guess
B	mm
C	well it's almost that
C	it's so tight
B	oh right
C	um
B	so they've got
C	they're trying to get it done A S A F P
A	yeah
C	um
B	oh
C	it's kind of er a bit construction's happening in parallel with design
C	and er they're
C	using us
C	as
A	mm
C	it's not that terrible
A	well it's er it's good in that you can sort of feed back things that need to be done like instantly
C	yeah
A	you might otherwise have kind of finalized design and you'd never have thought of it until you started building it
C	yeah
A	but
C	um
A	it's not often that you have a situation where
A	design can't be finalized properly
C	mm
C	we we design the pipework and send that to the the pipework fabrication subcontractor
A	right
C	who then develops as build drawings about how they plan to make it
A	yeah
C	instead of necessarily taking different sections and
A	yeah
C	bolting them together
A	yeah
C	or whatever
B	um
C	for example
B	ah
C	reasonably interesting
A	yeah
A	yeah I've
C	mm
A	and the company's finally decided they want to stump up for this bit of kit
C	mm
A	which would kind of validate my research
C	oh excellent
A	er so if we get this bit of kit we can do lots of
C	mm
A	and um but you can't test if my theory's correct if
A	um does
A	does er does its safety features
B	nice
A	so we bought a VW Polo
A	and it's a really good one
C	yeah
A	well a proper boy racer car
A	and we've just I've just been like taking it apart and like logging loads of data
B	cool
A	um plotting it in MATLAB and doing analysis and stuff like that
C	sounds pretty awesome
A	it's quite basic stuff
C	mm
A	much about mechanical stuff before that
C	you actually get to take stuff apart and play with
A	yeah
C	play with gadgets
A	and my other project which is starting on Monday is a European funded project to do with thermo-electric generators
C	mm
A	like EU funded thing to work out if it's worthwhile putting these generators on the tail-pipes of trucks like exhaust-pipes
C	mm
A	electrical solid state type thing between a hot source which is the exhaust gas and a cold source which is the engine coolant
C	right
A	um and we're like a subcontractor for one of the main people
C	is the engine sort of really the coolest thing?
A	well it it is a reservoir
C	oh okay
A	I mean the only other thing you could use is air
C	yeah
A	but it's not like easy enough to transfer to
C	right
A	it'll be typically be ninety degrees
C	oh right
A	there's enough of a differential to use the engine cooler as yeah
C	right
A	as the cold source
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	mm
A	have you been in London today?
C	sorry?
A	have you been in London today?
C	yeah
A	how did it go? Were you rowing?
C	yeah
A	who for?
C	Cantabs
A	what's that? Is that like graduates or something?
A	right
C	um
A	yeah
C	you know the last boathouse you pass before you get to
A	right
C	um that's it
A	oh okay
C	so it's way it's the furthest out
A	yeah
C	I didn't find out because I only I got the e-mail from the Cantabs people about our results but I don't know about er Selwyn
A	hmm
C	and I think Cantabs M2 and Selwyn M2 might be interesting to compare
A	are you in different divisions then?
C	we're in different categories
A	right
C	um
A	mm
C	Cantabs M2 is in IM2
A	is that intermediate men or something?
C	yeah
A	right
C	um
A	it's quite a funny thing the Selwyn
C	um and then
A	Selwyn M2 are novice
C	Selwyn M1 and Cantabs M1
A	yeah
C	are also in different categories
A	Selwyn M1
C	mm?
A	what's Selwyn M1? Are they in the novice category as well?
C	I dunno
B	wuh
C	Selwyn
A	what are they in? What
C	what are they in?
A	yeah
C	oh er can't remember which category
A	oh right
C	I think  I think  Cantabs M1 might be a um
C	something above IM
A	right
C	something else
A	mm
C	so
B	hmm
A	out of?
C	four hundred and four
B	mm
A	that's very good
B	pretty good
A	is that your division then? Or just everyone?
C	everyone
A	okay
C	it takes a fucking long time
A	yeah
C	so er at the start yeah so they're seeded and so everybody goes in order of their expected um roughly expected result
A	mm
C	so Leander one goes past
A	who's Leander one?
C	er well first boat of Leander which is one of the  one of the  boat clubs on the Thames
A	right
C	and Leander is generally accepted as the best in the country
A	okay
C	molesey is another one
A	oh right
B	nice
C	in three
A	what the Czechs?
C	a few different European clubs
A	oh right
C	um
A	right
C	Cos they've got they don't they wouldn't waste their time
A	yeah
C	I don't know
A	mm
C	Don't know
A	yeah
B	so you could probably find out
C	just it's just backwards
A	right
C	and obviously not on the same day
B	should've asked
A	um
A	I'm alright I think for now
B	do you wanna drink
C	um
A	Peter's gonna open his whisky soon anyway
C	I'll avoid whisky
C	er
B	there's beer
C	um
C	I'm er I'm leaning more towards beer
B	yeah
C	guessing I know where to find it
C	I'm alright
B	ooh
C	mhm
B	ah
C	I er met up with
B	was it good?
C	nice
B	have a nice chat?
C	yeah
B	I've got a plaster
C	or something
B	dettol? Antiseptic wash
B	probably
C	dettol sounds like what you
B	oh yeah
C	ready to use skin wound spray
B	yeah
C	yeah right
B	it's it's um
C	okay for broken skin as well?
B	I think it I think it's just the same as um
C	got myself a nice blister
B	savlon
C	as you can see
B	yeah
C	but er it appeared and then ripped and it was
B	uh
C	quite agonizing
C	but um er yeah
B	nasty
C	got a plaster?
B	yes I have
C	well no not really
B	oh
C	um yeah
A	what have you done?
C	got myself a massive blister
A	oh nice
C	I think it's got bits of Thames in it
A	oh no
B	oh
C	yeah
B	what's that?
A	is that worse than
C	Weil's disease
A	I was gonna say is that worse than Weil's disease
C	it's the same thing
B	oh right
C	Cos if anything is certain it's certain that rats have pissed in the Thames
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	can I play with your iPad?
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	although to my body's credit it also seem
B	there you go
C	seems to have already re-grafted the skin slightly
A	right
B	nice
C	where the blister
A	that's pretty good going
C	opened up
B	is it clean? That'll do
A	hmm
B	still have the inclination to do
A	this is his fourth year project?
B	the um book in the er um iBooks or whatever it's called is from his fourth year project
C	oh yeah
A	you can tell this is a
B	yeah
A	a book for electrical engineers
A	just says an inverter is just a big box of electronics
B	nice
A	no
B	nice
A	there's so much to it
C	I don't even know what the inverter does
A	there's so much to it
A	it's not just anything
B	excellent
C	what does an inverter do?
A	DC to AC
C	oh okay
A	it's the opposite of rectifier
C	uh-huh
A	let's see
C	I know you can er you can achieve a really crude um AC to DC with a few diodes and a capacitor
A	yeah
C	or two
A	that's a simple
C	is that basically it?
A	a simple rectifier
C	mm
A	it's for like what you use to
A	what you use to power motors and things
C	it was nice er having the door opened to me
B	oh yes
C	unlike last year last
A	did that not happen last time?
C	no
B	mm
C	last time
A	quizzed?
B	you can't give us an enigma and then not answer
C	mm
C	I did
B	did eventually let you in
B	yeah
B	ah
C	in fact I'm er oh must of er finished about twenty-five minutes ago
B	finished

C	now whose is this?
D	that's
C	yeah
D	what?
C	red wine
D	yeah
C	in the fridge
D	oh yeah
C	it's mine from formal
D	oh I think that's been donated now
A	yeah
C	I get the impression um Blue Fitness is missing
D	A few things
C	a
D	well it it doesn't have any free weights
A	is this the one we went to?
C	yeah the their insurance
D	no no
C	probably doesn't cover free weights
A	which one are you talking about?
D	er it's at the University Centre
C	I'm now a member there
D	it's a very nice gym
C	yeah
D	um
C	the only upper body stuff that it has are chest presses and those things
D	shoulder presses
C	sorry?
D	shoulder press
C	er alright
D	um
C	that's it
D	well it's got I suppose it's got no it's got it's um
C	well they've got that crazy hand pedal thing
D	oh I do love that
C	I've only tried it like
A	mm
C	once for a couple of minutes as a warm down
D	I do a five minute session
A	it's interesting
D	um
C	mm
D	but it's a little weird
A	which one?
D	er
D	do that
A	looks like boxing or something
C	no
A	mm
D	oh um yeah we've got one in the gym we were in um today
C	mm
D	actually
A	have you heard of this site called Fitocracy before?
C	yeah
D	no I don't er
A	have you heard of it?
C	I've heard of it
A	it's good
D	I don't tend to Google well I don't tend to use the internet in fitness
C	I know there was an XKCD comic about
A	yeah that's what I that's where I got it from
C	I think I've heard of it before that but
A	took me a long time to get an invite to it
D	an invite?
A	so it's like
C	yeah
A	it's kinda like
D	like Facebook?
A	sort of social media
D	right
A	but it's not really like Facebook
D	right
A	so every time you do a work-out or any form of exercise you log it
D	mm
A	um
D	mm
A	but you can track it on the website and then export it as a sort of CSV thing and then you can
[ANNOTATION]	they refer to a physical activity tracker	Entailment
D	oh right
A	so if I go on my profile and history and then like select an exercise
D	ah
C	mm
D	um
C	that's quite an amusing
D	mm
A	do you like that?
C	mm
A	it just randomly came to me some time
D	what is it?
C	probably an actual word
A	das Rumpsteak
[ANNOTATION]	speaker c finds it boring	Contradiction
C	mm
A	so like I look back at what I did this week
D	you see I've got one like this with the  with the
A	mm
D	which is quite weird
C	mm
A	oh dear
D	mm
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a worked out twice this week	Neutral
A	yeah no I I understand that
C	mm
D	um anyway yes er bleurgh
A	yeah
D	so how do you get an invite?
A	um
C	mm
A	of tracking stuff really
D	ooh
C	mm
D	so there's only basically
[ANNOTATION]	they are being quiet	Contradiction
C	it's er
D	two numbers I need to keep track of
A	but it's good if er if you do like weights and stuff
C	mm
A	yeah
C	mm
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a is training for the olympics	Neutral
A	although I only know one other person that uses it
C	mm
A	two K test?
C	yep
A	as in a
C	yep
[ANNOTATION]	no one else uses the app	Contradiction
C	um
A	really?
D	er
C	they do them all in one day
A	right
C	and anyone can join  can join  You don't just have to be in the Oxford area
A	yeah
C	so er apparently Imperial won it one year
A	yeah
C	so we're gonna enter
A	mm
C	in there
C	um
D	can I ask you a question
C	yeah my
D	when you're free?
A	yeah
C	would be quite fun
D	you were racing today right?
C	yes
D	have you showered since?
C	um
D	can you please go and shower? As in I can smell you from here
C	okay
D	there's spare towels
C	there was choice about choice between getting a ridiculously late bus or
D	I've no objection to that
C	nope
D	right I'll get you a towel
C	do I smell of the Thames?
A	I've got a blocked nose
C	probably do
A	so I can't really smell anything
C	thank you
D	there's a towel
C	yep
D	uh
C	mm
A	er dunno
D	I plan on getting up about seven
A	that's quite early
D	it's quarter past eleven
C	in my experience of your getting up at the weekend times when you say you want to get up at seven you generally get up twelve
D	yes
A	we have to go  we have to go  and get me a gym
A	induction at nine
C	what?
A	me and
C	oh
A	in order to get me into the gym er we had to agree that I was gonna go for a
A	to cover the back of the lady who very nicely let me
A	yeah I thought we were leaving earlier as well
C	I thought we were leaving at seven thirty
D	that was the
A	yeah I thought we were as well
D	original idea
A	Cos we could still just do that
C	yeah
D	yeah
A	yeah
C	mm
A	because
D	no I don't wanna fuck her over
A	yeah
D	um and that means we can just make lunch in the morning and
C	mm
D	do other stuff
C	we're only gonna get to Derby like
D	well I reckon we'll be starting the walk about twelve
C	better be
D	well I reckon the walk's gonna take well under six hours
C	that's a bit more acceptable
D	oh good
C	mhm
D	it or even if that is watch Dan sleep
C	mm
D	it's alright
C	he won't be now
D	yeah I think I may have just successfully put you off an early night
C	now the people who transcribe all of this
D	yeah
C	how well do they know
D	um
D	fairly well
C	yeah
D	mm
A	oh so they don't know her that well then
D	well er yeah well she sort of manages them
C	so right now the person listening to it knows that who we're talking about
A	I wasn't even listening
D	we weren't actually
C	people who are transcribing that
A	right
C	from
D	mm
D	doesn't have the same cool hat
C	mm
D	right
A	um
D	I mean for example
A	not not Magnum PI
D	I was thinking er possibly Despicable Me
C	oh
A	I'm not gonna watch
D	um
A	I might even go to bed
D	or what else? Um episode of er Stargate Universe if you wanna see that?
A	er not particularly

A	I agree with  I agree with  films like Dark Knight
D	Batman Begins
A	yeah
D	it's just um it
A	but Air Force One
D	oh that's brilliant
A	bit cheesy
D	why does that not surprise me that you like that film

A	right
D	and er I haven't actually watched that or at least finished watching it
A	this?
D	yeah

A	oh hello
D	I think you both enjoyed that film
C	you have no idea how much

C	I didn't get the  I didn't get the  crappest stuff
A	right
D	just not
A	well it's
