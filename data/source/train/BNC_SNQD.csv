B	is there lemon in there?
C	yeah a little bit but there's mainly two other kinds of vinegar
B	okay and oil and salt and pepper?
C	er not yeah yeah pretty sure
A	have you had
C	no I mean I've read bits of the thesis
C	what
C	it's probably pretty good fun though
C	erm we could chuck the rice I don't know the soup you get to prune some of it into the
B	yeah yeah
C	but then we'll be weird then going onto something else that
B	well let's have that first let's have let's do this rice and see if we oh no but does
B	we have some
C	put the soup in the soup
B	yeah
B	still put it in the mousakka

B	oh whatever where's that?
C	little bowl of
B	oh here's the other beer dude are you
A	er yeah yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A knew exactly how much time this would take, which is a lot.	Contradiction

B	yeah
C	yeah
B	less
[ANNOTATION]	He dit not find that job in a conventional way.	Neutral
C	last time I saw him he was so drunk
B	he's really good socially but he's sort of a bit gnarly philosophically
C	yeah
B	he's just he's sort of
C	are you doing the rice here as well? are you doing
B	I think we should
B	he just gets too serious and too aggressive and he loses
C	well it's part of the style I can't believe he
[ANNOTATION]	This man had drunk a lot last time they saw him.	Entailment
B	he's he's he's loyal
C	what?
B	he's loyal
C	it's astounding
B	I put it on the table
C	just gonna get
B	we need that chair
C	you can't be loyal you've just gotta do what you think is true
B	yeah yeah
C	maybe he thinks the true
B	Djokovic is is down a set and about to maybe lose a second set
C	who's the other?
B	I don't know
A	excited for the cricket?
C	what?
A	excited for the cricket?

C	they're so what?
A	they're both I think both teams are really up for it
C	yeah yeah yeah do you want a little taste of my soup? here it's not very much
B	yeah
C	well I'll just put some in the
B	yeah
C	every time I turn round
A	do you want me to leave the door open?
B	erm we have been because it's been hot
C	what?
B	we have been leaving the door open
C	yeah suppose we shouldn't really be leaving it
A	I don't know can't tell maybe if I look out there probably
C	probably not here you are
C	it's gone white though it's all the sort of
B	paint what?
C	I think it looks so cool the bottom half of the house all white
B	do you wanna share this?
C	yeah I did I asked people so next of all we're gonna have a bit of
A	yeah
C	okay let's get three plates
A	erm
C	living? living life have you been abroad since we last saw you?
A	I don't think so
A	erm that was the letterbox
B	mm
A	yeah
B	is it a letter or is it a flyer?
A	that's
C	they were
B	I wish
C	I think that's coming from America and in Canada maybe
B	these are both
C	I think it's just
B	the pizza?
C	the pizza
B	is this
C	mm
A	thank you
B	you're welcome
A	can you pass me a
B	yeah
A	bowl
C	that because
B	I can put
C	are you going to Greece?
A	well nothing is booked but my I did my I was intending to go in September
C	could be a good time
A	cos that's when it's the best
B	oh my god
C	oh fantastic time
B	yeah
C	with a bit of luck the euro will slump even further
A	yeah I'm a bit wary I I don't really wanna go there and be like having a holiday when everyone else like the country's falling apart
B	yeah
C	well no but that you can't think that because your going there is good for them
A	yeah I know
C	yeah
A	but I could just give money to
C	but it's not really falling apart
C	no but when you look at them nobody's nobody's starving
B	oh
C	they look pretty comfortable to me
B	I've put the pizza in but it'll be ready in ten minutes
C	erm and that's just
B	okay
C	okay
B	I have no idea what to think about what's going on
A	I think they did the right I think that was a good thing they did
C	yeah
B	seemed like most of them think it's a good thing
A	I think that's really I couldn't really believe that they like cos they had sort of months ago were trying to get rustle up the money to pay the thing and they tell the IMF they'll cut the defence budget they'll get the money that way
C	great idea
A	and then they're not they weren't allowed to do it by the IMF
C	really?
B	why?
A	cos the IMF are probably lobbied by arms
C	oh
B	oh my god I didn't know that
C	oh oh wait wait are they part of NATO?
B	I don't know
A	I don't think I don't
C	I don't know if it was that it could have just been NATO treaty obligations but
A	I mean even if erm say they've spent massively on arms more than any other European country over the last like over the last
C	really? why?
A	because
C	some other scam no doubt
C	hm?
A	some defence guy from their last government or pre like pre two thousand and eight government is in prison
B	oh my god
A	but they also I guess
C	well they should
A	but that's what people say about Germany cos Germany aren't allowed to spend money on it
B	yeah that's right
A	no weapons and they have the strongest economy
B	yeah
C	that is that is such a bonus
C	and the
B	yeah do they have an army?
B	yeah why did the erm finance minister resign?
A	cos he's like a erm it seems what it is is a way for the prime minister to have more
C	yeah
B	oh I see so he didn't do you think the prime minister made him? he did it sort of
C	it's a good move
A	it's probably his idea since
C	he
B	oh really?
C	well it was a good move he he really
B	he was tough huh?
A	he was calling them terrorists
A	he called the
B	yeah that was
C	yeah he was pretty offensive and they
A	he's cool though did you see the pictures of him like riding out of riding away on his motorbike?
C	looks like Bruce Willis
C	well
B	yeah he'll come back
C	all those politicians think you know okay I'll go off then
A	he's not a politician though
B	that's true
C	oh he's just an economist?
A	yeah
C	oh
B	wow I didn't even
A	that whole that whole parliament is not made up of politicians
B	what's what about the prime minister?
A	the same
C	well they they've
B	yeah this is
C	you know what? you know how everybody thinks that you should pronounce the letter
A	well I if I was reading Greek?
C	yeah
A	erm
C	cos the Greeks pronounce it the way I used to pronounce it
B	what?
C	well they say he says oh he says oh
A	I say
B	okay so it's seven
C	keep your plate
B	forty
B	no we can't go anywhere
C	no this is it we've had our freedom and now we're bound to
B	no but we got an email today and there's some legislation that says
C	oh goody so I can't actually have my AR fifty-one one five slung over my shoulder
B	it it it doesn't happen that often I mean
C	no just
C	like
B	like erm yeah but also in in
C	oh good that's a good American reassurance there
B	Colorado had open gun law
C	I just think it's disgusting
B	I know it's a bummer
C	yeah and then there's this Texas
A	what happens if all the academics
B	well they did the the
C	every
B	university tried to fight it and obviously even the students
C	now now
C	probably he's trying to say that's oh yeah no there's a woman there's woman that didn't a white woman who didn't get into
B	really?
C	mm mm and it's now reached the supreme court
B	well
C	and
B	I think
B	yeah they did away with it some time ago
C	yeah but if you do it just on test scores and all the
B	that's actually
C	oh right
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	yeah I do it's ridiculous
B	right
C	trigger warning ah has
A	no it's only in like the English faculty
C	oh the sort of trendy English
A	what just like?
C	trigger warning
B	what is a trigger warning?
A	it's like if there's a lecture about something that if there's a scene in that book where
C	what I like is the fact that they
B	they don't discuss it?
A	they no they do discuss it but as a trigger warning so
B	oh so you have to like flag it before it happens? god I'm so glad I teach philosophy
B	I mean sort of abstract
C	well if you
B	I don't do that anymore
C	abortion
B	yeah
C	think about the Bible the Bible should have a trigger warning cos
B	yeah
C	there's there's murder fratricide straightaway and then there's a whole tonne of incest in the first book
B	can you pass me the water?
C	yep anyway I'd never even heard of
A	it's deuce in the six five
B	really?
A	yeah so you might you just you just lost an advantage point
C	who did?
B	damn
A	the
C	ah
B	oh yeah
C	so on on the second set or what?
A	yeah
C	oh so he nearly broke him again
B	yeah it's not as tasty as mine
C	well I try I sometimes make them when it's very
B	well I'm just having a
C	I heard you er I
B	and I was so
C	erm
B	and then I saw the mouse we have a mouse
A	mice are cute
B	it was it was small and cute but I don't like it
C	oh boy god we've been like this for how long now? four three-and-a-half months
C	shit
A	tiebreak
C	it's the beginning of the end probably so was he more
B	I don't know I
A	he just he had an advantage point break point
B	he looks like a
C	what's the erm timing on this?
B	it's been in for five minutes
C	oh right
B	yeah?
A	no
C	no
A	I don't know where
C	yeah
A	to stay on holiday erm at hostels and stuff
C	right
A	er they've probably got a B and B place
A	I know I was reading about I I quite want to go to Albania cos
C	oh my god man
A	like it doesn't really have an industry there for like beach holidays yet
B	yeah
A	and all the beaches like no there's like a few
C	a few what?
A	there's like one or two hotels and like and
C	there's no one there
A	amazing beaches
C	that right I know I
B	is it safe?
C	can you cross the border from Greece?
A	you can take a ferry from
B	that's
C	yeah from Italy
A	and it's like it's like thirty euros
C	yeah you can't actually cross the border from Greece then?
A	probably can
C	probably can yeah well it's Muslim and it's erm in the south and it's pretty lawless but I'm sure you'd be okay as a tourist
A	I'm
C	yeah I don't
A	lots of people my
B	oh really?
C	oh I I thought is that because there was some emigration?
A	yeah
C	what?
A	can't remember cos
B	wow
A	and someone in
C	really? wow
C	okay there's a good book about what was that book we read about?
B	oh the revenge
C	no no the study of big you know totalitarian dictatorship
C	what do you want me to do?
B	just I might need you to
C	mm
B	or maybe
C	you want erm the most sausagy one give him that one
B	okay

C	choose a
B	yeah I like that though
C	yeah well that's nice too but
C	no I like the park
B	they have south parks
C	and then there's
B	that's not fenced off that's a big in
B	but it's not in the centre so
C	it's not really in the true centre
B	no
C	I mean of course there's
B	yeah
C	have you heard of
A	yeah
C	does he does he have a reputation
A	yeah it's been like
C	oh really? really? cos he looks I'm
A	it's like it's like a long history of doing it it's like he's like eighty and still doing it
A	he doesn't have he doesn't have one-to-one supervisions with female students
B	he's been banned from doing that?
C	I didn't know that
B	Christ
A	or a or a self-imposed ban or something like
C	anyway
B	wow
C	I'm
B	oh you were?
C	well
B	he was there?
C	he was part of this thing I was doing

B	mm

B	oh this is kind of spicy
A	mm not really
A	well I know I know
C	yeah
B	you mean academically?
C	its whole style
B	mm
B	mm
C	erm er
C	mm
A	not not that I known them have known from
C	everyone?
A	I don't think anybody from
B	really?
C	mm
C	really?
B	mm
[ANNOTATION]	speaker A knows everyone	Contradiction
C	relationship
A	that yeah that's it does get more
C	mm
[ANNOTATION]	it does not get there	Contradiction
B	oh my god it was pretty shameless when I was there
C	what do you mean shameless? trying to get state school?
C	I mean positive discrimination
B	yeah
B	yeah it's a bit
C	and you know you're in trouble
A	take them to the high court
B	yeah
B	she's just a nightmare
C	she's a bit like Scary Spice
B	she is like Scary Spice
C	she's erm very forward and very
B	she's
C	she's
B	that's okay though
C	I like that I
B	it's just that she's super-political and
[ANNOTATION]	she is a distance relative of Scary Spice	Neutral
C	yeah the thing is she feels
B	she causes like
C	she feels she has total entitlement because
B	she's black and she's a woman in
C	it's a shame because
B	yeah
C	have a certain entitlement but
[ANNOTATION]	she is of Ghana descent	Neutral
B	she will never she will never be
C	but she
B	would probably make a difference
C	I think she'll be a good thing in future and I think she will
B	he did? that guy
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	she future looks doomed	Contradiction
C	mm
B	that's amazing Djokovic
A	on a tiebreak
C	mm
A	and he was four nil down in the tiebreak
[ANNOTATION]	Djokovic was four nil down the tiebreak	Entailment
B	what happened to Federer? because they were showing
C	god I should think everyone else is praying for Djokovic to be knocked out
B	wait I just wanna see
C	well listen we can all we can all shoot on the sofa if we wanna watch it?
B	yeah but I just wanna see if it's oh it's only on one channel oh it's okay so what happened with Federer? that can't his game can't be over
C	was he playing too?
B	yeah
A	you press the red button to see more
B	they went to try to show us some doubles match that I never
A	no they're just they have all the matches on play
B	oh
A	some doubles match
C	now have another slice
B	what do I do now?
A	choose court Wimbledon
B	is it
B	oh that's
C	do you want some moussaka on your pizza?
A	okay thanks
C	great
B	I don't know
C	I don't know
C	so what do you think about
A	erm no
C	you haven't?
B	yeah I don't know what is going on I think that happened to me I actually tried to do it the other day and I got so frustrated
C	what did you think about Charlie Hebdo?
A	erm
C	yeah
A	it's it's always a line where who knows when you're going too far? but
C	I agree but then people
A	freedom of speech is like it's not freedom to offend people
C	well and how
C	well the thing
A	I don't see like why those cartoons
C	if you look at the first amendment of the US confirmation it's pretty absolute it's says really you can say what you like except when it's a direct threat that will
A	we're not in the United States though
C	well no I know but
A	they
B	yeah
C	oh
B	that was my piece
A	I don't know how to get back into like to get away from this
C	it's very very difficult
B	I think that could be a rule of thumb
C	what?
C	I mean if I I'm you know
A	yeah but why does there have to be a law about it?
C	why does there have to be?
B	there doesn't have to be a law but
C	well
B	it would be a nice rule of thumb
C	this book reckons that quite a few of our laws and European
B	oh
C	they violate the first amendment
B	yeah
B	what are your
C	erm I don't
B	what if you say I hate racist rhetoric?
[ANNOTATION]	According to Speaker C's book, European laws do not go against the first amendment.	Contradiction
C	yeah well that's the great thing do we tolerate the intolerant? and we have to tolerate the intolerant to make the intolerant kind of
B	oh you have?
C	yeah
B	that's what you've been doing?
C	yeah I've been
C	I'm not wasting my time I'm doing research of course you could research
B	and are you gonna include it in your review?
C	mm mm no probably not
B	yeah
B	what was the first the first part?
C	well I mean you see one of the points it makes it an offence to use threatening abusive or insulting words or behaviour that causes or is likely to cause another person harassment alarm or distress but that just puts
B	that's why I think the first
C	when you say fuck
B	the first part of the
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker C thinks offensive language and harassment should be avoided, even when it is against intolerant people.	Entailment
C	yeah but you
B	it's not it's what's the I mean read it again one more time? the first part of the class is what's gonna be
C	I mean I'm actually reading his summary of it but I can I've actually got the the law itself as well here
B	insulting I guess yeah hateful
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker C thinks using insulting words only against transphobes is ok.	Neutral
C	well there are some of the things they use
B	yeah that's too vague that's too mm
C	a person yeah here's the rule fear or provocation of violence a person is guilty of an offence if he A uses towards another person threatening abusive or insulting words or behaviour or B distributes or displays to another person any writing sign or other visible representation on which is threatening abusive or insulting comma with intent to cause that person to believe that immediate unlawful violence will be used against him or another by any person so it's quite a heavy qualification in that
B	yeah it's not bad
C	immediate unlawful
B	it's pretty good yeah I mean if they
C	yeah no they do
A	Djokovic broke him
B	yeah you see that's the thing about Djokovic cannot
B	he's tough I think he's the toughest the mentally toughest one
[ANNOTATION]	Djokovic is very soft and sensitive.	Contradiction
C	yeah I think he is
B	yeah but he
C	he's always recovered
B	you can't tell if he's actually faking it or
C	oh no then you remember then immediately he starts sort of limping and
B	I know yeah yeah it's true
C	sort of pretending he's not well
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker C thinks that more of their country's laws are unlawful in comparison to the European ones.	Neutral
B	it's like he's injured
C	he's just such a
B	well that wasn't a one of our best suppers ever
C	I thought it was great when
C	yeah
A	I don't I don't have a phone
[ANNOTATION]	B thinks he is heavily injured in the leg.	Neutral
C	you don't have a phone?
B	what?
C	are you post-phone or just at?
A	well it it just broke and I can't even I it's quite nice not having one what's the password?
C	how often?
A	I'll have it if no one else wants it
B	who wants it?
C	do you like rhubarb? were having
A	yeah it's alright
B	cool
B	I don't really download
C	no this to this is updates that they're asking
B	oh no I don't think I've had that
C	oh
B	is that what?
C	it's called a biography of the first amendment
A	land of the free
C	what?
A	land of the free
A	well it was
B	safer society
C	no safe
A	it's what they said about the the latest
C	yeah and guess what? how many murderers are there in US prisons? one hundred and sixty-five thousand murderers in prisons and that's the ones they've caught
A	that's like the guy said after that guy went into that church and killed
B	yeah?
C	coming from a good place
B	yeah?
B	mm
C	he's coming from a kind of region you see under there and under the wall there may be interconnecting with areas where the pipes run and
B	oh well I guess that is all gonna be sealed up
C	yes
A	erm I
C	hm?
A	mum used to give me five pounds every mouse that I she said
C	five quid?
A	yeah
C	woah
A	only like sixty quid
C	wow it's three nil
B	who?
A	Djokovic
C	Djokovic
B	ah he's coming back
C	well he can afford to lose a set
B	I have no idea I've never heard of him
A	he's number fourteen
C	but which country?
A	er
C	oh
