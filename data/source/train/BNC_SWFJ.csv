B	oh
D	so you said that the ownership's changed

D	remember last time we went there was that really surreal conversation about what was it? The injections it was having or something?
D	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about school	Contradiction
C	that was that woman wasn't it
D	yeah that was that woman
A	last time we were
B	mm
A	we spoke to that
B	oh yeah
A	the last time we were here it was from revolution
B	mm

C	it's slightly burnt
B	you two got the alright ones
A	yeah

B	mm
A	are they coming here for before his birthday
B	I think so I don't know
C	no
A	are you having a little party?
C	hopefully yeah
B	well if the weather's nice I'd quite like to go to erm there's a what would you call it? A woodland park area? What was it? A it's not a National Trust area but it's a wildlife area I guess
A	okay
B	but erm they've got barbecues set up in little
D	mm
B	so you could just take your barbecue stuff and just cook your own barbecues
A	mm that's nice
B	but you had a team party there didn't you?
C	mm
B	I don't know
A	Don't know so you could have really well
C	well last year it was boiling wasn't it but I think it would be a bit
B	easter's always nice
D	yeah it usually isn't it?
A	mm
B	Jesus makes sure
D	yeah
D	yeah
B	mm
D	what was it we were listening on the radio on the way down here? They were talking about erm vicars and what was it?
A	oh
B	ah
A	for all of the choir people
D	yeah  for the  for the choir
A	anybody who's in the choir needs a CRB check
C	what?
A	mm
D	and then there was all these that were phoning in saying well yeah our choir's been disbanded because the the vicar didn't want a CRB check and all this kind of stuff
B	oh my God
C	it's not the choir you need to worry about
D	yeah
B	it's like how far do you take it?
A	it's extremes yeah
B	how sad
A	because there's too much paper work involved rather than people just going in enjoying singing together
D	yeah
B	but I bet community choirs and stuff don't have to do that because it's just people just turn up don't they?
A	yeah I suppose
B	were you listening to Jeremy Vine?
A	it would be a bit much if they
D	erm
A	what channel's he on?
B	radio two
D	radio two
B	lunchtime
A	yeah
C	that sounds like a very Jeremy Vine thing to talk about
D	yeah
A	mm mm
D	yeah the other day I was listening to it and they had the oh I won't repeat it now
A	why?
D	it was the anti circumcision league
D	it was quite funny
B	I used to love listening to Jeremy Vine but now they get such extremes phoning up that you just think they're just having a big row now
A	mm
D	mm
B	mm
A	what's this new? There's a new trend with female circumcision
C	I know
C	well it's very big in Egypt isn't it anyway apparently
A	is it?
C	yeah apparently
A	I didn't know that
D	there's a lot more impact on their their organs than the male though
C	well they say because it's illegal now in Egypt they were saying how
A	really
D	yeah
B	because it's dodgy
A	oh that's not good
C	I think it said something like seventy percent of all Egyptian woman have had it done
D	really
A	I never even knew that
C	because you're not allowed any pleasure
C	that's what  That's what  it's for
A	is it?
C	yeah it's to stop the craving of it or the thought about it
A	really? I
[ANNOTATION]	Person A  is talking about the other job that did last week	Contradiction
D	yeah it makes it extremely painful
C	I think in Nigeria and places like that they do a lot of it as well
D	mm
B	how horrendous
[ANNOTATION]	Person B think the things that going on Nigeria and Places like that are horrendous	Neutral
D	mm
A	but they said the trend is coming to England quite a lot
B	really?
C	well I'd imagine that's probably from the African communities
D	yeah
A	mm
B	hmm
A	that
D	that was fantastic
C	thank you very much
[ANNOTATION]	Person C agree with Person f in what changes he want to do	Contradiction
B	you put them in at seven o'clock
D	no
C	half past nine
D	you could really taste the cider in that
C	yeah it was nice wasn't it
A	yeah
D	yeah
B	A lovely sauce
D	it was very nice
B	see we'd love to cook
A	no
D	yeah but she was drinking your sloe gin the other day
B	was she?
A	oh yes she did
D	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Person D could not find something that put on the table before	Contradiction
D	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Person D said yeah	Neutral
A	I think dad might have polished that off
D	oh right
B	oh did you like it?
A	but oh it was lovely
B	we've got some more
D	that was well nice
A	mm
D	yeah in that little bottle with the the cork
[ANNOTATION]	Person D could not find something that put on the table before	Contradiction
B	yeah yeah
A	mm
D	yeah
A	mm
B	but we had our we were making lots of Christmas presents and one of the Christmas presents was erm onion chutney or onion sweet onion relish
C	yeah
B	that's what we'd been making just before
A	yeah it's lovely
B	yeah that's lovely but then if you clean it but it smells of onions and then you make onion er onion vodka basically
B	onion fruit vodka
A	huh
C	mm
B	it just
A	sounds lovely
D	onion fruit vodka?
B	well because the pan just had so
A	yeah well because used the same
C	yeah
B	but you know sometimes you if you make a curry in a pan you can even though you've washed it you can still a bit of curry
A	yeah
B	well it obviously had a bit of onion still lingering so now we've got onion fruit vodka
C	four bottles of onion fruit
B	two
A	and does it? It turns liqueury?
C	yeah that's the whole point of it yeah
B	yeah
C	well you can try some later
A	then I went to the shop and realised how expensive vodka is nowadays
B	yeah
A	I thought it was really cheap stuff
D	really? How much?
A	yeah well I don't know
B	twenty quid a bottle
D	twenty?
B	well we bought a massive one
C	no
A	yeah but I thought it was
B	Stingy
A	yeah I think I am
B	because you could make quite a lot with that probably so in the end it's actually quite
C	Cos it triples in strength doesn't it if you put sugar in it and leave it
D	does it?
A	mm
C	mm
B	moonshine and stuff
D	fisherman's Friends
C	and that
B	so you just
D	is it really?
C	if you put
A	menthol
B	yeah and it just blows your head off
D	yeah?
C	but yeah leave it so it becomes like a liqueur or whatever but he said that's the big drink over there
D	wow
C	I just thought Fisherman's Friends that's like disgusting but
A	well I don't know it's like I quite like a menthol drink
C	yeah maybe it might be quite nice
D	yeah
A	how long do you have to leave it for?
C	I think sort of two or three months
B	it's like a sambucary type
A	Cos you have to put sugar?
C	I think yeah
D	hmm
B	the trouble is you just don't know how strong it is so it could be really strong
D	it could blind you
B	yeah cos that's what they say about moonshine isn't it? Cos I remember my friend at university made some moonshine and I told dad and he said you could go blind
A	moonshine
D	I remember
B	I don't know how you make moonshine but it's with vodka and
D	I don't know
B	potatoes?
C	well no it's not like vodka it is the potato isn't it?
B	it's potato
C	well it doesn't have to be potato
B	yeah you could make
A	mm
C	well I remember your mum and dad saying about how they used to get the marrow
B	oh yeah
C	and they'd
B	no I don't think they poured anything in it and they just leave it that it drips through the bottom because it ferments
C	oh yeah that's it it was just like yeah
D	your mum and dad used to do that?
B	into a demijohn or something
D	wow
A	from a marrow?
B	yeah
C	I think I would personally choose something nicer than a marrow but
A	mm
B	yeah yeah
A	well you can do it with any any fruit can you?
C	yeah
A	mm
B	anything that could ferment I guess
D	mm
B	let's do it
C	well we'll try some onion fruit vodka in a bit
A	mm
C	and we'll see what you think about it
B	I know I shouldn't have said it because now you're going to think it taste of it
A	well
D	yeah
A	you eat onions raw and cooked
B	yeah but onions and fruit
D	I don't know
C	yeah onion onions and strawberries
D	oh okay
C	it's not a classic mix is it?
B	oh I don't know
C	yeah that's true
A	oh he put strawberries in
D	hmm
B	was all wrong
A	yeah
C	she was the
A	mm
B	and that mango dessert
A	mm
B	what is our dessert?
C	well
B	no but it's five to ten now
C	right well okay
B	oh it would have been amazing
C	A lemon surprise
B	that it's not
B	it's a raw lemon on a plate
A	yeah
D	we are  We are  men
B	well don't be sexist
A	yes
B	because we deserve it more because we've worked harder
A	I'm not going to comment because I'll get in trouble
B	Don't be
D	Good
B	Don't be beaten down by him just because you're married now
A	yeah but when I think about it
B	yeah you don't have
A	next week I might say I I worked harder
D	well done
B	well done
A	but I did
B	you won't get a beating
C	you've been living with
A	drive
B	yeah you drive
D	but I did navigate
A	yes yeah but it wasn't as hard as driving
D	no it wasn't
A	driving is harder
B	did you have a sat nav?
D	er yeah but
B	I did navigate
C	driving is actually
B	it was tiring
C	it is
A	yeah
C	especially on motorways
A	especially me because I'm like this
B	I think you're really brave
D	yeah
A	yeah yeah
B	and then if it was me driving with just
A	you need someone in the back to occupy her
D	is she good at travelling?
C	she's not too bad actually is she?
B	no she's not that
D	she doesn't puke up or anything?
B	not anymore
C	not since the dreaded puking up days
B	oh every trip
D	yeah I remember that one
C	and she shat herself didn't she?
B	oh yeah
D	oh
B	oh every journey would be a stress because you'd just be thinking what's that noise? Ugh she's being sick
A	oh
C	we had to take a towel with us everywhere didn't we?
B	yeah
A	just with the travelling? But she's alright now?
B	yeah she's alright now
C	yeah
B	we kind of worked out that perhaps it was because we were giving her a bottle of milk so that she would go to sleep because she was still of the age where she'd she'd have to have milk all the time
C	yeah
D	no
B	makes cheese
B	makes cheese vomit
D	some kids just don't grow out of that anyway do they
B	no
D	they're they're sick forever
B	well luckily she's got
A	oh

C	I think it was a Bentley Continental
B	yeah
C	A Lamborghini Morado and an Aston Martin
B	I don't know

A	she probably just
D	was the room nice?
B	yeah it was lovely
A	what was the room like?

B	no they've been kicked out now
C	no they got moved out a couple of days later
A	they got kicked out
B	but walking around that
D	yeah

A	oh I thought they were supposed to be the erm what do you call them?
B	it was all about erm the corporate what was it? Erm
D	well
C	capitalism and corporate
B	ninety-nine percent and all that stuff yeah
A	yeah it was supposed to be about the bankers and stuff isn't it

D	well it's not though is it
B	no
A	people have their own ideas and just decide to protest

B	no
D	it was just like a bunch of kids
B	mm
D	complaining about
B	and the thing was
D	mm
A	and that's why they camped there
B	so don't go and use those facilities

C	playing playing a piano
B	oh yeah playing the piano
A	where did they get the piano?
C	yeah I don't know

C	no not at all they all seemed
A	no
D	no
B	yeah yeah
C	yeah they weren't like that at all

A	they're doing that in Belgium as well
D	well all over
A	yeah he was talking on the internet
B	yeah
D	like they were in their tents and I was speaking to them
B	oh really
D	and I was trying to get them to to realise that they needed some like a clear message to unite and not not so much a demand but a like focus on one thing
B	clear message
D	and they
B	yeah
D	yeah
B	just buying into
A	mm
D	yeah
B	yeah
D	they were anti chrony capitalist protestors which is something completely different but they didn't make that clear
B	yeah
D	yeah just need some leadership really
B	yeah
D	so what else did you do in London then?
B	well then that evening er I think we just stayed I can't remember

D	Cutty Sark? No
B	so we saw that and we were walking around
D	that looks dangerous
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	in a gin bottle
B	yeah you know you've got to use bottles don't you
A	just a little
B	it does look syrupy? Erm and we went to Vinopolis which is erm a place that Laithwaites have a shop and it's a massive tasting area of wines and stuff so we went there cos we thought we better had do go to where there's a shop for Laithwaites and do my homework
D	mm
B	erm went walked around around Borough Market for ages and then we were like right okay
D	yeah
A	mm
B	but we were walking down this other bit erm and it
D	mm
B	so we queued up and this woman came out with blood all over her face
A	oh yeah
B	so we went to the tombs of London
A	ah okay
B	ah god it was amazing
D	yeah
B	so you walked in and she went right I'll tell you all about this
B	and we followed her and we went into another bit where there was a man hacking
A	yeah
B	and then the very end bit they were like right this is the proper tombs
B	and blow in your face and they were covered in blood and there was a man with a chainsaw
A	mm
B	but it was really good wasn't it? It was so much fun
C	I loved it
A	yeah that sounds brilliant
D	it does sound good
B	but
C	I did  I did  feel really vulnerable I must say being on the end
B	yeah
D	yeah
B	it was really good
A	that would freak me out
B	it was really really scary
C	but yeah and then there was like you know you went through this bit and there was all limbs that had been chopped up and everything
B	just swinging around and going up to you and going
A	mm
C	and they had the noise playing didn't they obviously so there obviously wasn't a chainsaw was there
B	yeah
C	it was brilliant
D	that sounds good
A	brilliant yeah
B	oh
C	but the bit before it where it wasn't the scary bit was really funny as well wasn't it
B	yeah yeah
C	yeah
B	and there was this little girl
B	and what happens is you're walking along and then
C	yeah they send you in one at a time or two at well in parts
B	yeah and you have to wait until the other people have gone
C	so you just hear screams basically
B	and she goes it's your turn next
A	mm
B	it was so funny wasn't it?
D	that sounds great
B	have you heard of it then?
A	did you scream? No no not that one no
D	no
B	I screamed loads it was so funny
D	yeah
B	oh yeah
A	the day after the wedding we went on the ghost tour
B	oh did you?
D	we went  We went  underground into the you know the the old tunnels and stuff
B	yeah
D	but there was this guide
B	oh great
D	you know in that
B	yeah
A	yeah like that
D	one of them kind of cloaks
B	yeah yeah it's
D	like a red cloak
B	mm
D	because that was like big in Edinburgh
C	burk and Hare or whatever they were called
B	ah
D	yeah that's it and then you go underground into all these tombs and then
A	mm cos the underground network in is massive
D	it's massive
B	oh is it?
D	yeah
C	it is like a big city isn't it
A	yeah
D	yeah
A	yeah they used live
D	and it was quite weird because you would be down there and it would be like all dripping and
B	yeah yeah
A	yeah
D	so you you could hear all this like
B	really?
D	but it was quite weird
D	yeah
A	and then there was all these weird witchy rooms with the circle and she
D	yeah
B	otherwise you'll disappear
A	I wouldn't dare
D	yeah I was the same I was like
B	yeah yeah sometimes you just want you don't want to tempt fate do you
A	and when yeah
D	yeah and then someone ran past and and screamed you know to make
A	mm
D	but it had that one
B	yeah
A	it wasn't like your one
B	oh it was
A	yeah
D	yeah
C	I think
A	mm
C	Cos at the start when we actually paid for it we
B	we'd gone through the back entrance so we didn't even se the build up outside
C	no that's right yeah
A	mm
B	outside the other side they were like going come over here come on
C	yeah and we went into this room and it was as we paid the money
B	about the history of the underground
C	and it was like oh no
B	and it was oh god we can't get out of this now I've paid twenty-five quid each for that
B	so I've got to go and sit through some history lesson
C	I
D	maybe
A	maybe yeah yeah
D	that's quite clever then yeah
A	yeah
B	because it was like the shitiest video you have ever seen and you're like oh god they've really spent like zero pence
C	yeah and it was only ten people
B	yeah
A	thank you
D	that sounds awesome that does
A	it does sound really good
C	it was  It was  one of the funniest things I've ever been on I must say
A	yeah
D	yeah
B	you know but we almost didn't do that didn't we because we were just like oh twenty-five pounds
D	I think they are great things like that
B	but we were like come on you're in London
D	yeah yeah
B	so I'm glad we did it
D	yeah but one of the best things about London is there is lots of free stuff to do as well
A	lots of
C	yeah that's it
B	yeah yeah so you could balance it out
A	yeah
C	and things like Natural History Museum and the Science Museum are just incredible
A	yeah
B	I know we hadn't probably
C	it's like some of the best the best attractions in Britain really I think
D	yeah
A	yeah
B	oh god and then in the evening we were like right okay lets go to Leicester Square
C	oh it's horrendous
B	you just can't believe that amount of people there
C	just crazy
B	Cos last time we went to a show we just went straight there
A	where?
D	yeah

D	yeah yeah I've been there that time as well
C	I just hate things like that
B	oh it's horrendous isn't it? You just
D	no

B	you don't feel like you're in London
A	you could be anywhere in the world
D	no it's weird it's so

B	oh god
D	it's horrible isn't it
A	mm
C	he was only on
B	yeah he
D	yeah
C	he was probably on for about four minutes probably and then just
B	yeah it's you just feel so awkward don't you?
D	yeah
C	you know when they say like they die you know
D	yeah
B	just like stuttering and just like  and then  and then they try and go on to another subject because they know that last subject hasn't worked and then
D	yeah
A	oh
D	and once that's got in you once it's set you it just gets worse doesn't it?
B	it's just too late
C	yeah
B	oh I just felt
A	but the other acts were good
D	it's a tough job isn't it? Jesus
B	oh yeah well we didn't go to the Comedy Store because we turned up and the doorman was like this

B	yeah properly put down and he was going
B	and then the man was going this pen means I'm going to be the next president of the U S of A and everyone was like boo
