B	I haven't been up that road before that was a
C	well hopefully someone's gonna get back to me
A	well how many more could you do with? did you want to get about eight a week?
C	I think I could do yeah I could do with well if have two more then hopefully it will start with word of mouth really cos the problem is at the moment the one on that I've got tonight that's not good for word of mouth because high school
A	yeah
C	but yeah the ones I've got on Wednesday I mean she did say that she had handed my leaflet to someone else but
A	wait and see I suppose
C	mm
A	she she's probably waiting to see if you're any good
C	well she said she had passed it round
A	oh she did? yeah yeah
A	cos people were looking
C	yeah
A	and of course you are very very good I know that
C	er
B	put it on the leaflet I'm good
C	you could do with a
B	and you're gonna put an advert in Co-op aren't you?

B	yeah or other the other side of the wall yeah
A	and it
C	next to it?
A	and it is free to post it?
B	well it used to be
A	I that's what I thought that's why I said to do it
B	haven't done one for a while but you know
A	do Morrisons have something similar?
B	they do something similar I don't know whether they charge though you could put one in there as well
A	just thinking being hanging around at
C	mm
A	you'll have grandma phone up is this you
A	we were passing some time in Morrisons
B	we heard
A	waiting for the ambulance
B	yeah
A	oh dear
B	yes
B	looking at the board
B	yes
A	are they is she gonna stop taking him to Morrisons?
B	yes
A	definitely?
B	well it's what I've said to them if him er he said oh I'm not going there again good
A	oh he said he wasn't gonna go again?
B	yeah
A	oh
B	but whether he'll remember that
C	mm
B	is something else
A	yes
C	well she needs to remember
B	yeah but she goes back on everything she says like the driving
C	mm
B	well I've er I've gotta go and get some glasses for grandpa or something I
C	oh she's oh
B	so er says one thing does another
C	well glasses is the last thing he's gonna need after his cataract operation to
A	yeah it should be making him better
B	mm
A	his driving however is never gonna get better
C	it's not about whether he can see it's about his awareness and unfortunately
A	has he actually been erm told to stop by the DVLA yet or a doctor or somebody yet or not? or is he in that advisory six-month period where it's up to him?
B	he's in that advisory six months
A	when does that end?
B	well it's open to debate but I
A	so he's got till April
B	about that time so he's got till the end of
A	mm
B	April at the most I've said
A	does he do any driving?
B	no no no
C	well it's
A	he won't want to go back to it
C	at this stage well you hope that he wouldn't want to but if he does he's gonna be even more of a danger because he's gonna be completely out of habit
B	he does pass the odd comments and
A	mm
B	when I'm back on the road type throwaway comment but
C	oh no
A	I don't think he means it does he?
B	half the time hopefully not I don't think he
C	well I know it sounds a bit mean but you could just keep telling him that he's in his six month and he can't drive yet and he probably wouldn't compute that it hasn't been
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	but obviously
B	yeah
C	grandma you know grandma
A	grandma would then tell him
C	would then so yeah he'd just be er clutching
C	yeah well I'll do that erm before I go in an hour or so
A	can you work out where the place is that we're going to on Wednesday? how to get there and what time we need to leave?
B	yeah
A	that's your job
C	is it so it's an
B	yeah
A	does it start at two? two
B	half two
A	two thirty
C	be lunchtime
A	is it gonna
C	mm
A	go on till five? is there'll be a break I imagine won't there? an interval and then er
B	yeah I yeah I think it'd finish about five
A	maybe
B	these things usually go for
A	five thirty? I don't know
C	mm
B	couple of hours and a half an hour break twenty minute break
A	what are you saying
C	mm
A	mm? you joining in
B	hello
C	where's your muslin?
A	he threw it down there
C	mm
A	is he dribbling?
C	no
A	so is your mother just gonna phone you when she wants
B	yeah
A	picking up? is she gonna leave her mobile phone on this time so when you call back she can answer it?
C	oh is that what happened?
B	she doesn't know how to answer it
A	no she does she does it all the time she says to me she
C	oh
A	phones up and she said erm I've called
C	oh
A	well I'm calling you to find out I said well
C	I dunno
A	I don't know
A	where he is and what he's doing so then I phoned you didn't I? and you said you said you'd had a couple of messages and every time you got back to her it went straight to voicemail
C	mm
B	yeah said that
A	so she
B	said they would ring cos he's got her phone off
A	she
C	useful
B	yes
A	so we've gotta tell her to leave it on and then how to answer it she doesn't know how to answer it she only knows how to make a call
C	well that's a step in the right direction
B	a start with not the full
A	well fancy leaving a message saying call me back and then turning your phone off and putting it in your bag
C	sounds about right
A	oh she's useless
B	yes
A	I suppose she just expects you to answer the phone when she rings so
C	mm
A	she phoned on Saturday but I was at the hairdresser's and your dad was at work so I got a voicemail message about them being at
C	oh okay
A	so
C	no
A	needs to
C	yes
A	I suppose she keeps
B	no doubt
A	every
B	well she spends her whole
A	what about
B	hours on the phone to her
A	mm what about
C	daily
B	I dunno about him
C	doubt it doubt he has any idea
A	mm
B	no
A	anyway you see if you
B	flits in and out
A	if you ask
B	airport now? okay yeah
A	well we'd be there by just after well twelve thirty? twelve forty-five the flight's not until two thirty but

A	yeah we'll go we'll go at twelve erm
C	okey-doke
A	and then
C	Saturday

B	I don't
C	snowy hopefully
B	hopefully yes
A	yeah sunny hopefully
C	yes one can hope better than here
C	that
A	about the bathroom?
C	oh
B	small
C	you remember us moaning about that? being on the toilet and having a shower at the same time
B	the same time
C	whilst doing your teeth
A	it doesn't look very glamorous cos I've googled it it's something called the village
C	oh you need to show me in a minute
A	oh well I'll google it but
A	looks basic to me
B	but not nice
C	you probably shouldn't put nice in the sentence
A	I'm not even sure well she's lucky got her own bathroom because I were I wasn't sure when I looked on their website whether they were individual
C	mm yeah if they were shared yeah
A	because it said things like if you want a hairdryer go to reception and we'll see if we can find one for you to borrow so it was kind of a
B	yeah a communal
A	it sounded like a
C	oh we don't do that
A	it sounded like a youth hostel
B	a communal hairdryer
A	well she doesn't
B	is available
A	she doesn't use a hairdryer
C	hi
A	obviously it'll be alright cos she's with
C	there you go
B	oh there we are
A	time for a nappy change
C	yeah
A	you starting at half four?
C	yeah
A	okay
C	hello we change it now so nanny doesn't have to change it when I'm gone
A	good idea
A	earning Spanish
A	gosh that looks very wet it's full
B	been drinking a lot
A	yeah
B	he's been asleep a lot
C	yes that's also the problem
A	so
B	right
A	I said well
C	I thought you just said Saturday mornings
A	I meant Friday
C	oh
A	and I said well I'm not gonna get back into a a regular day said I'll invite her on Sundays
C	yeah
A	erm
A	but
B	no
A	in the evening so
C	no
A	I said well that's fine she'll go out with
C	I mean we would offer to pick her up we can't really fit her in the car
A	oh I wouldn't bother she can no she can sort herself if she wants to come
C	yeah
B	think it's nice to be able to er go when she wants as well doesn't she? from here
A	well she'd had enough hadn't she after
B	yeah
A	a couple of hours yesterday
B	so she can go and
A	she I think she just gets to that point she reaches that point where she's just had enough and she wants to
B	which is fine
A	I suppose so I I think she's just more erm into her own company now
B	I'd say yeah yeah yes
A	she's not bothered about spending a massive amount of time with everybody is she?
B	doesn't appear so
A	and
B	on Sunday yeah
A	and erm plus the fact
A	she's will want to get home and have an early night cos we'll have been late the night before and they've got school
A	so I thought well that's fine so I'm not gonna prepare anything and I'm gonna leave
B	do okay
A	I
C	we shall sort
A	well and I suppose see if we
C	mm
A	and after last year's
C	mm
A	you you decide with
C	okay
A	let us know and it might be easier to go out if it's just gonna be us the six of us
C	yeah yeah
A	maybe the
C	that's fine yeah
A	somewhere cheap and cheerful
C	yeah we can have me and
C	have a look
B	carvery somewhere will be fine er you know yeah
A	well yeah a carvery especially with us getting back so late the night before it saves having to
B	best you can prepare by
C	problem with a carvery is you can't book anywhere on a Sunday
B	oh okay
A	no that's true
C	so we'll be waiting then
B	well er
A	yeah
B	oh
C	and we
A	I suppose we should well we should invite mum and it's up to her then
C	we can invite her and then
A	yeah she can come if she wants yeah
C	yeah if you're gonna ring her up then she might
A	yeah yeah
C	say oh just drop a present round

C	neck muscles

A	I'm posing for a photo
B	the neck muscles are only just developing surely
A	he's very strong as it is but you'd just think you'd wanna put your arms forward

B	smiling it's like a
C	no you've got to do this
B	torture
C	you've got to do this for the neck muscles cos otherwise
B	oh right
A	yes I know it's good to to go on your front like that you used to like it on your front you did
C	well he doesn't love it but you know we all have to do things we don't like

C	oh
A	and in the casserole I do there's sweet potato
[ANNOTATION]	the result of freezing sweet potato soup was satisfactory	Contradiction
C	maybe it's cos curries and casseroles and
A	maybe
C	or when it is by itself like a thick soup or a thick
A	yeah
C	puree it's just that
A	no I think it came out sicky and
[ANNOTATION]	the thicker the liquid is, the better the ice cube	Contradiction
C	yeah it did yeah
A	and er yeah and they weren't and
C	when you do it when you did it fresh would I eat it then?
A	probably
C	oh there you go then
A	yeah I can't remember but you used to like that with erm

C	how many?
A	three point five out of five
C	yeah who's rating it?
B	that's
A	who like who like youth hostels
C	pardon?
A	people who like youth hostels
C	yeah
A	oh
C	ah well a start
A	right well you can have a look at this oh er there now there's a little selection of the room and the bathroom
B	ah
C	oh yes it is small isn't it?
A	like a youth hostel isn't it?
C	yeah yeah it's basic
B	how long are they stopping there?
C	very basic
A	well until they come home now so they've got
B	right
A	three nights so they'll be leaving on Thursday
C	oh wow
B	okay
A	erm
C	so they come back on
A	yeah they they land at six in the morning on Friday in

C	she was working
A	the day off now which is better
C	yeah
A	erm they've been on a bike as well
C	on the moped thing
A	they've got helmets in helmets on
A	they're on a moped they they'd been round and seen the island
B	okay
A	she said it was great
A	oh I'm sure she did
B	I can't remember where I've seen it
A	reviewed December nothing fancy
A	oh yeah we arrived erm early but couldn't get into our room before check-in it clearly wasn't busy but the lady at the desk was not budging
C	oh dear
A	we had frogs getting under the bath erm under the
A	lots of rainfall
B	headbutting
A	he's thinking
A	he's not sure
C	he's
B	his legs are doing the work
C	good boy
A	oh somebody was mis-sold this they said when when we arrived nobody was around to greet us
A	another couple were also waiting to check in when a girl eventually showed us to our room it was nothing like the description on the internet
A	no refrigerator no flat-screen TV no bottled water
A	dirty toilet dirty stained bed sheets
C	oh
A	oh horrible
C	oh he'd be really at least
A	yeah
C	well
A	what you sign up for
C	yeah
A	I don't think
C	no well if you were if you were told that it was a nice
A	well if you're
C	had all the amenities and
A	expecting flat-screen TV and all that type of thing
C	well yeah you would be annoyed and you would give it
A	yeah
C	a rubbish rating which is
A	yeah
C	but yeah it depends what you want isn't it? because if you do want to go out there and have four or five star luxury
A	and loads of other people have said staff is
C	no
A	but erm yeah I remember looking at the photos and thinking mm yeah not for me
C	not somewhere I would stay
A	she said as well that erm when she was in KL airport this morning she
B	oh
A	what did she have? a cinnamon and raisin bagel and an orange juice it was wonderful
C	oh yes
A	just what I would've had at home mum if when I'm not feeling well
A	tummy's still not quite right
B	quite right
C	oh dear
A	so er she managed to get something to eat there I didn't ask her if she found that perfume she wanted
C	well to be honest with the photos that they're taking of you've got that one of where
A	oh no no I don't think I saw that
C	oh I think it was on a Whatsapp that she sent us
A	are you sure it wasn't an Instagram photo?
C	it was erm mm it might've been
A	cos I
A	I've I've
C	anyway she it was like a erm it was a shack basically and it was kind of all these little
A	you're right
C	not restaurants just
A	it was Whatsapp I did see it
C	yes
A	yeah yes I
C	er so it wasn't yeah er they were they were just kind of erm
A	mm
C	almost
A	mm
C	ordered something wasn't it? so
A	looked a bit nasty
B	mm
C	I mean
A	it's the sort of
C	er you know
A	thing though that he was used to eating er
C	yeah yeah yeah
A	in Shanghai that's what they did all the time
C	yeah
A	when they were in China
C	yeah yeah
A	cos there's little
C	well
A	tiny places
C	when they were living in their flat they used to just bring back cheap pasta and
A	yeah
C	cook it didn't they?
A	yeah
C	but so that would've been a bit different to
A	I know when I was there with
C	yeah well she yeah
A	obviously she she's used to it
C	yeah
A	and she's grown up with it but she even said to me some of this stuff really is horrible and it smelt foul but
C	yeah
A	I didn't touch it because
C	oh yeah
A	I thought I'm not gonna risk picking anything up on these erm
C	no no no certainly not
A	yet like I say sometimes they're the best places to eat and some of the nicer restaurants that look nice
A	are the ones with the dirty kitchens so it is very difficult to tell
C	mm
A	you do take pot luck really I mean we just stay in the hotels when we go don't we? so
C	yeah
A	but you wouldn't be stopping in this one for long I don't think
C	no
A	yeah well he's er he's happy he's on his
A	almost
C	yeah
A	almost starting to crawl there you're gonna move along aren't you
A	too much trouble
B	he just can't
A	get me off this roll mum
B	mm
A	so what's on the agenda for your erm year seven pupil tonight then
C	erm we are doing
B	maths?
C	just faceplants the floor
A	mm
C	yeah we're doing some maths of course but erm it's multiplying and dividing by ten a hundred and a thousand
A	yeah
C	yeah and then we're using that to then multiply by multiples of ten a hundred and a thousand so doing like erm
B	both ways

A	no you
C	aren't I?
A	you you you move the point then
C	no you move the point two don't you? so it's a hundred and twenty
A	yeah you move the point
C	really
A	yeah yeah
B	we always used to just move the point left or right
C	yeah yeah
B	then we just
B	because there's always after the point there's nought so if and you don't add them they're always there
C	yeah but if you if you use the rule if
B	so twelve is twelve point nought nought nought nought nought nought nought nought nought nought nought
C	yeah yeah yeah but if you use the rule if you times by a hundred you add two noughts on the end then if you times the number one point two by one hundred you'd say oh well it's one point two
A	nought nought which is isn't
C	which isn't cos that's the same number
A	so
B	mm
A	but obviously I
C	yes obviously the yes
A	yeah
C	the rule is you move yeah move the point or but we've got a erm a printer out like a
A	are you listening to this
C	a grid that's got
B	yeah
C	hundred thousand erm ten thousand thousand hundred tens you can't call them units any more you call them ones point tenths hundredth thousandths and so then you've got digit cards so she makes a number and then you times it by a thousand so each digit moves three places to the left and then obviously if you've got any space before your point still then you've gotta
B	yes
A	do that
C	fill them with noughts zeros
B	yeah
C	place value holders mm
B	mm
A	mm does anybody want a drink? I'm just gonna get some water
B	I think
C	I don't think so
B	I need to go to
A	in a
B	drop my stuff off
A	you can wait a few more minutes yet before you go
C	a few more minutes
A	I'll put this in the bin
C	what are you dropping off at
B	last week's returns paperwork job sheet all that sort of thing
C	oh
B	timesheet
C	sign up last week?
B	er nine
C	for the lottery? nine what's the what's the quota for the week what do you have to fill?
B	oh it's usually about fourteen
C	oh okay
B	but that doesn't really seem to be set in stone cos
C	really
B	it depends whether you where you go of course erm
C	uhu
B	but that's the er for a part timer like me that's the well
C	are there any decent workers at the moment that are getting
B	well we this new lady we took on
C	oh really?
B	but they don't seem to want to
C	but is there only the three of you that do it? that's it?
B	well there are the five of us that do it
C	oh
B	but erm oh well there's about never seem to sort of er monitor how we're doing cos we're losing more people than we're starting cos they
C	oh the yeah
B	you know they don't renew or
C	yeah
B	they go and join another charity or whatever
C	mm
B	er but nobody seems to be
A	well you had agency staff in didn't you
B	we did yeah
A	but it didn't work out?
B	well tried them
A	didn't you
B	briefly yeah
A	didn't you lose where the the donations went or what happened?
B	they lost them
C	oh
B	and er
C	you lost them
B	apparently
C	ah
B	erm the forms but er and then they they
C	oh well
A	did any of the forms turn
B	so it all
A	did the forms turn up eventually or not?
B	I think they might have done actually yeah yeah
A	mm
B	but we kitted out them out with all their
A	did you?
C	and then just
B	and then they
C	did a week and
C	it was all a bit of a disaster I'm afraid
A	mm
C	ah that's annoying that's what you get with
B	well yes well er
A	so
A	changing the subject for a minute
B	ten till one
A	oh okay I thought it was nine till twelve ten till one what time do you want to go over
C	Thursday
A	Thursday I've got
C	I need to be back at
A	oh is that when you're swimming?
C	swimming
A	that'll be nice
C	going swimming on Thursday
C	swimming
A	well shall we go at about eleven for an hour?
C	yeah
A	do you want to come to me and we'll go?
C	yeah
A	okay
B	I have to be there at half nine but it's usual isn't it half an hour before
A	yeah but we don't wanna come for the three hours do we?
B	oh crikey
A	we didn't wanna come for
C	oh crike no
A	just wanna come for a laugh don't we
B	that'll be good
B	yeah
C	shall we pop you into your chair for a minute
A	and you've got to ask him if you're as good as
C	ah whoosh
B	right
A	yes you'll need to know
C	oh
A	oh
C	sorry
A	Horsey Horsey?
C	I just knocked the book
A	you looking at the little red bird he's your favourite isn't he
C	yeah we like him
A	mm
B	you doing something on Thursday?
C	erm we'll just go
C	yeah we're just going with erm
B	okay
C	I think they're the only ones out of the four of us who well us and them do swimming
B	right
C	the other ones
A	is it a general session everyday in the baby pool?
C	yeah they have erm schools go and er
A	yeah
C	some point so we'll just go for when I'll give them a ring and ask them what time is the best best to go I think that's the best way of doing it
A	and what does it cost now a session?
C	he's free under fours
A	yeah
C	and er I'm four pounds I think
A	do you get a timeslot for that or
C	you go as long as you like
B	as long as you can survive or last for
C	yes
C	which in this case is about twenty minutes
B	right yes
A	have they still got all the big erm seating area in the big pool?
C	yeah yeah
A	used to be a good place to watch
C	it seems a bit well yeah it seems a bit pointless now because they've shortened the
B	yeah
C	so that's the long bit now that you swim up and down and they've got the lanes there and then so that's an oblong shape and then you've got they've like built a I don't know like a not a bridge because it goes through the pool but it you know like a walkway across and then they've made the other pool like a kind of square shape there so it's not bear in mind the seats are like the whole way across there which was ideal when you swam in that pool
A	yeah
C	go down along the seats
A	well yeah
C	but now it's now it's that way so I don't know why they've done it like that but
B	so there's no diving area now?
C	not at the moment cos they're refurbing the diving boards but they're normally you know there is
B	it's still deep enough to
C	well yeah that whole pool there is deep
B	still deep yeah
C	because that's the deep that was the deep end of the
B	it was yeah
C	long pool wasn't it? so all that pool's deep now so they just use it for swimming which I think well if you have like if you think of
A	what swimming lessons?
C	yeah but
B	went down
C	if you have no you have galas there
A	oh yeah you were older when you started the galas but you
C	yeah
A	your swimming lessons you were only about five weren't you?
C	yeah yeah but I mean if you had so when you started swimming in galas
A	yeah
C	and you did lengths or you joined a swimming club like
A	yeah
C	but they've got nowhere to rest in that pool cos it's all deep
B	oh
C	so it doesn't really make
A	mm
C	a lot of sense
B	so what do they do on the left hand side then?
C	I dunno
B	cos I suppose what it does it uses the part the diving bit area which wasn't perhaps used as much before
C	yeah
B	so they can get other people in the left hand side possibly having other classes or
C	yeah
B	and then obviously got
C	yeah because that's the only well that's the only one that's warm enough for him
B	yeah
A	was
C	I don't know
A	cos you we never went there did we? like we went to
C	hello
C	hello
A	but you never did
C	yeah cos yeah it's got a nice seating yeah
A	you were never up against
C	no all I can remember is all erm
B	didn't seem to be in the region did it? or
A	but they did
C	yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	who he used to swim for
C	yeah
B	yeah they do
A	oh I don't know
B	have
C	I dunno
A	so you think it the club might have been called
A	could have been
B	yeah
A	I dunno
B	well if you think well
C	yeah
B	all those sort of places
A	yeah
C	no we went quite far afield like erm what was the one the other side of
A	you used to go up to
A	at
B	that's still
C	mm that doesn't make a lot of sense but
B	whereas
C	oh you don't wanna be down there
A	no
C	you don't wanna be down there
B	thank you

C	okay
A	we'll be right by it won't we? and we just I'll get some pictures printed
C	yeah okay
A	we can do that
C	I'll see what time we're planning on swimming and work around that

A	of course he could see
B	which one do you look at now?
A	you're looking are you?
C	mm dilemma
C	it's all going
A	what's happening? it's so patchy

A	it's so patchy
C	it's probably gonna grow back white
A	white
C	mm
A	could grow back ginger
B	ah
C	no I reckon blond
A	do you think I think he'll be blond yeah I
C	yeah
A	I think he'll go blond like daddy mm?
C	yes
A	and your auntie
A	you're very strong
C	we ordered auntie
A	ah that's nice oh I've got to sort that out this week don't know what to get
C	we need to get her a birthday present
A	what you gonna get her?
C	well I was thinking you know well like auntie
A	I thought you did that
C	no no no
A	oh did she?
C	yeah
A	from the boys?
C	yeah
A	oh okay no I I thought you'd done it
A	yeah
C	I was just gonna order one off there but they've got some nice ones and they've got auntie written in the middle so I thought I might
A	oh that's a good idea
C	get something like that
A	yeah that's a good idea
C	mainly from him really not from
A	oh I bet there are lots
C	cos I haven't got a clue what to get her
A	well I don't I was thinking of jewellery but there's no point now she's working at
C	no no no no I wouldn't get her jewellery
A	because that's all she can wear anyway
C	well yeah if she doesn't if you get her jewellery she'll wear it for a week and then decide that it's not
A	well if I get her anything she'll
C	yeah I suppose erm
B	buy her well well
C	I was gonna say where do they eat lots?
B	I know it's not very
C	you could get her a voucher for somewhere that they eat
A	oh that's a good idea
C	but I don't know where they eat a lot
B	so she can use for something rather than
C	cos they're not going to the sushi place that they love any more are they?
A	why not?
C	oh didn't you hear about it? they had a bad
A	oh no I think
C	oh no you didn't
A	why what happened? no the one
C	oh
A	in
C	yeah yeah yeah well I asked them about it the other day and I said oh cos they went out
A	when did they last go?
C	for sushi they popped in to see me and
A	oh I
C	four weeks ago?
A	yes yeah I remember them going there they didn't
C	yeah yeah yeah
A	say anything bad about it well not sort of
C	no well I asked them the other day and I think we were with you but I was talking to
A	mm
C	said oh did you go to for sushi in
A	yeah
C	that they like but yeah they went to this one and it was the night
A	sushi again?
C	yeah I think so and it was the night that we went that they came to drop in on us and er
A	yeah
C	yeah it was all erm what did she say? it was the the
A	yeah
C	they have the tuna they it was really gristly and chewy and erm just really bad er
A	did they complain?
C	yeah yeah and they said that it's not normally like this you know we've been a few times
A	yeah
C	and it's not and they
A	and what did they say?
C	oh er it's well it's it's it's what it it's what we always have they said and they kind of just passed it off as
A	well that's a bit bad
C	so it was all a bit odd
A	yeah
C	mm
A	well yeah cos they're completely gonna lose their custom now
C	yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	and they go a lot
C	and then the
A	oh
C	yeah something about the salmon wasn't nice either it just tasted weird but yeah so no they er they're not going again
B	oh dear
A	crikey oh I didn't realise that oh well not a voucher for that place then?
C	no not a voucher for there don't get one for there
A	and she doesn't shop at Topshop any more does she?
C	not really well whatever she shops at she just takes it all back
A	well it's all it's Asos really but
C	Asos she likes
A	yeah but it
B	online
A	most of that goes back
C	yeah
A	and erm I don't
C	no
C	there's not a lot of point erm
A	but the food place is good but they liked that place erm
C	yes they did didn't they?
A	but I dunno if you get vouchers for places like that
C	no
A	you just have to
C	it's a
A	book a meal and pay I suppose
C	it's not really a chain is it? so
A	no
A	and I daren't just book a meal and say I'll pay because she'll take
C	who knows what they have yeah yeah
C	no don't no you're gonna yeah

C	oh I've gotta go soon
B	you need to use it at least five times a week
A	yeah I'll get
B	before they can pay really

A	three? yeah and it's done in about five minutes isn't it?
B	yes I think they do have to stop a bit though

C	back in a minute
B	yes
C	just gonna go and check on my printing
A	oh yeah I saw there was paper all over the printer
B	I put some more in
B	put some more in
A	honestly
B	well I don't mind I mean
A	well well no you should but you dunno which job he's talking about if he's talking about the current one or or an upcoming one?
B	to be fair he did say Scottish job
A	well it yeah so
B	the Scottish job
A	well I well
B	er but he didn't talk venues er we didn't talk any of those just just
B	he said have I have I asked you yet?
A	they're having been
C	you know I'm always
A	right the yeah it's the well and they're having the pipe it's been delayed
A	by six weeks did he mention that?
B	no
A	right I think that's the one he's talking about it should have all come in in January and I think it's coming in March now
B	right
A	erm but they're having it
B	oh he did say they they were on er they were er on the sea as we speak so I so that is yeah
A	oh unless it's come right okay
B	yeah
A	I mean however long it takes I can't remember
B	on in transit yeah
A	yes well it's definitely the one in Aberdeen then or is it Aberdeen? or or is it
B	Aberdeen haven't been there
A	well it's somewhere he's got them because I remember
A	I asked
C	what's he like?
A	I asked
B	if he's still there
A	because we've used erm certain hauliers at certain docks and use their VAT deferment accounts cos
B	yeah
A	or well is it worth it? because then you won't have your car unless you get a hire car
B	but I'll see he he probably won't come back will he?
A	well he no he but if you push him on it he will just say listen you know we could do with a bit of cash at the moment what are you offering? it you you you somebody's gotta do it and they haven't got the manpower
B	that's right
A	and he'd rather have you do it but do you want to do it? cos I it you'll be probably committed to a and in fact how are you gonna fit your job around it? cos you'd be committed to it probably eight weeks ten weeks
B	I don't know I I don't know
A	unless he splits it with somebody else and you just do er the odd week and he goes up or somebody else does it I don't know
B	right yeah yeah
A	cos this was always the problem when he got rid of everybody when we got a job on we did you know we'd send
B	like
B	yeah
A	they do this type of thing
B	sure
A	yeah
C	well surely he's aware that
C	what dad does so
A	yeah it's
C	yeah yeah yeah
B	but I was just
C	yeah he'll still have
B	he doesn't er
B	put two and two together and get four
C	well no not always yeah
B	he was going for chips he said let's go to I'm going to
A	he wasn't last
B	and then we then we were I think the
A	oh
C	oh so you went to Mcdonald's?
A	was anybody else in the office? was
B	I saw
A	oh I see
B	so that was the timing
A	hey little
B	well
A	mm poppet
B	presume that
A	who? that oh
C	the
C	yeah yeah it's clean
A	do you wanna give it a a suck well cos
B	right I'm I need to go
C	can you pass me the dummy there?
C	mm
B	a what?
A	there we go sweetheart do you want some of that you're going tired again eh?
B	right we'll be back in a minute
A	alright
B	okay?
A	I'll try not to miss you
C	you off to
B	yes cos yeah I've gotta go just nip down and
C	well I won't be here when you get back but I'll
B	be here later
C	be swinging back at half past five if you're if you're still in
A	well he may
B	yeah
A	he may have gone again by then
C	yeah
A	to collect erm
B	right then
A	grandma and grandpa
C	well if not are you in tomorrow? or Wednesday? are you doing anything tomorrow?
B	on Wednesday Wednesday until we go up to
C	oh yeah
B	when we get back from
C	are you working tomorrow?
B	yeah all day yeah till later on so I won't be in
C	okay bye
A	right see you in a bit
B	see you in a bit
C	if I don't see you in a bit then yeah see you later
B	see you later
C	whenever
A	there
C	it might be safer
A	oh we'll see we'll see shall we? how many more of those have you printed off?
C	erm so I've done fifteen there's two a page so a hundred
A	so where are these destined for?
C	well I think by where you used to live
A	oh yeah I think that's a good idea
C	up there I think
A	yeah
C	that's my next
A	yeah I
C	my next target area
A	I was gonna text
C	yeah
A	and say it was a good idea and that you've you've got a few pupils now starting it off I think it'll just take a bit of time cos it I think you were lucky to get those two
C	yeah yeah
A	so quickly
C	oh definitely yeah
A	and all it takes now is word of mouth and all of a sudden you'll be
C	well this is the problem
A	you'll have too many waiting
C	because I've got those two quickly
A	yeah you were
C	I was like oh well when I went out and gave my other leaflets I was bit
A	disappointed
C	oh I need to get
A	mm
C	yeah cos er that's what I if I can just get because I'm
C	I can get a few that and quite you know it's quite possible that some of them will only want them till the end of this school year so
A	yeah but if you go back to work three full days would would you spend your other two days doing the tutoring on the evenings?
C	oh it depends with him and
A	because if you're doing the full day at school you won't get a chance to tutor then will you?
C	no no I wouldn't do it after school
A	so yeah
C	well then you know I'm I might
A	see
C	start on a Saturday or
A	yeah
C	something
A	yeah
C	it depends how much you know money and
A	how much it's worth it
C	if it's worth it and
A	absolutely yeah
C	so I'll have a think
A	yeah
C	I mean it is possible it might be the thing is if I was to do it after work on those days
A	yeah
C	because especially if we have him one full day in nursery
A	yeah
C	that would allow me to do it erm
A	yeah
C	come back and then
A	no that's true yeah
C	so you know it would be different and I'd have to start again over in
A	we can't leave you in nursery for longer than necessary can we? no you want to be out don't you? although I'll bet you'll have a lovely time
C	mm
A	if you like your mummy she did love to socialise she did she was a very happy playing with all the other children mm we'll have to see won't we?
A	you've got a few minutes
C	ten minutes or so
A	okay well
C	I hope not
A	we'll just see won't we? whether you
C	it depends cos well he went from quarter to eleven till I suppose well it's four hours isn't it?
C	yeah
A	will you let us know poppet eh? you will won't you? you'll let us know you will fish pie tonight
C	oh is that what's on the cooker?
A	yes Slimming World's own
C	yes looks er
A	super
C	healthy
A	Lighter Life today so I thought
C	oh yeah
A	and when I saw the price of it I thought this is stupid I've got to do it properly cos it's ridiculous
C	oh okay yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	to just keep having it and then falling apart in the evening
C	mm
A	that's no good
A	it's no good
C	no
A	no we wish we were babies again and all we had to do was put weight on cos that was the easy bit
C	yes yes yes yes
A	that's the easy bit isn't it? nobody likes taking it off
C	no it's boring
A	we're going to get mummy on the dance mat again soon aren't we? we're gonna get her fit
C	yes mummy needs to
A	any more thoughts on the christening anyway?
C	oh no I keep forgetting
A	oh but if at least if you book a date then that'll give you something to focus on
C	yeah I suppose
A	that
C	mm
A	you'll think right that's it now I've gonna I've gonna do this diet probably
A	well you do don't you when you've got something to work towards
C	yes I need to I'll ring the vicar at some yeah tomorrow or when I've got a little bit of time
A	there was just a period of time was it over Easter when nan wasn't around? not that we'll do it at Easter
C	yeah no I wouldn't do it at Easter but yeah
A	but I think sometime in March would be good towards the end of March?
C	yeah
A	maybe
C	well end of March is Easter
A	oh oh it is isn't it?
C	it's early this year yeah
A	well
C	yeah
A	and then we'll have to decide erm
C	I wouldn't go mad
A	no good
A	you wouldn't invite uncle
C	no
A	no I wouldn't
C	no
A	bother cos he's not really anything to
C	no no
A	I mean obviously
C	yeah yeah yeah
A	erm
C	so close family on both sides so
A	yeah
C	grandparents and parents siblings grandparents aunties uncles who
A	you see the the
C	we see
A	the difficulty is your auntie
C	exactly oh yeah of course I'll invite them
A	and I think she should because
C	yeah yeah sure she's
A	they'll want to come
C	made an effort and she's come up and seen him so
A	but I wouldn't I wouldn't wanna invite
C	well no
A	and I don't think you should have to I just wouldn't bother
C	no no no
A	because I'm thinking that afterwards I mean we'll probably come back for food and that won't we? so
A	either
C	yeah
A	well either we rent somewhere like the conservatory at
C	yeah well it's not open until April so gotta
A	right
C	bear that in mind
A	but it's gonna cost or we come back here
C	yeah
A	but we have to work out how many people we're catering for and
C	yeah yeah yeah
A	erm
C	erm
A	it's always a lot it would be nicer to have a little venue actually
C	yeah
A	but have to see what it would cost
A	what? are you tired now?
C	erm
A	eh?
C	well we'll see I'll get on the phone to the vicar this week and see what
A	see what she's got
C	yeah see what they've
A	cos you get yeah it'll just be family apart from
C	yeah
A	they're gonna be godparents
C	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	someone is asked to be a godparent	Entailment
A	yes
C	imagine the hoo-ha if she wasn't the problem is she's gonna kick up a fuss that
A	no I don't think well
C	she will
A	well it doesn't matter because
C	no I know it doesn't well it doesn't I know it doesn't matter but she'll
A	well she can kick up a fuss it's not her choice
C	no
A	erm and I don't think you should well it's not up to me either but I don't think it's a problem
C	no
[ANNOTATION]	someone will be complaining	Entailment
A	I was thinking about would
C	er probably not
A	or he probably would
[ANNOTATION]	someone will be easygoing	Contradiction
C	he
C	asks about him and he
A	see already look
C	well he asks about
A	yes yes
C	he asks about
A	oh oh god yeah
C	well yeah
A	oh and who would
C	well er
A	inviting everybody but she doesn't
C	and she doesn't like them
A	she doesn't like any of them she doesn't talk to them
[ANNOTATION]	she is angry with them	Neutral
C	well the problem no the thing is
A	yeah
C	and it would be
A	right
C	and that that's it I mean the we
[ANNOTATION]	she seldom talks to them	Entailment
A	see our
C	I I would draw the line
A	christening parties were about eleven in total
C	yeah
C	I would draw the line at the she's not having her
A	right yeah
C	it would be who we invited and
A	okay
[ANNOTATION]	she will be happy to come to the party	Contradiction
C	but I think we would have to
A	so if you've got eleven that side
C	those are the
A	and you've got you two
C	yeah
A	thirteen and then
C	nan
A	thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen eighteen grandparents twenty
C	no
A	but
C	okay so that's
A	so there'll be around
C	yeah
A	mm to thirty I'm thinking if you cater
C	yeah
A	if you do like a buffet
C	yeah
A	minimum sort of seven eight pound a head isn't it?
C	probably yeah
A	so that's gonna be like two hundred and fifty quid plus your so I suppose you know maybe about three hundred quid
C	yeah
A	to do something
C	I'd pay that
A	yeah
C	that wouldn't be yeah
A	that's not too bad is it?
C	no no
A	if we did something like that
C	yeah
A	and then we'd have the room and it would be but you know cos there's just no room in here especially that time of year when you can't go out in the garden
C	yeah you can't expand er
A	eh? we haven't included
C	mm
A	eh?
C	is she going to be at the front?
C	ah
A	hey oh oh oh oh oh let's see I think we're going to
C	yes okay
A	alright then we'll just get to the minute there
C	uhu
A	there
C	I'll get his water hopefully he'll drop off to sleep and then oh I'm going to have to go
A	are we gonna start to cry cos mummy's going out oh poppet come on then come on then oh oh let's stop that now
