A	so one of my issues with CLIL was the division of teachers and the division of work because
B	mm
A	erm
B	to
A	be EFL teachers
B	which would probably be the easier way wouldn't it?
A	exactly but then they're doing someone out of a job but according to him that wasn't that's not the way forward obviously cos his company's called
B	yeah
A	who run CLIL courses
B	yeah when I lived in Bali erm quite a a few people were getting jobs in international schools when they weren't the subject teacher
A	oh
B	er but they would have to teach for example biology
A	mm yeah
B	and that's quite daunting to have to properly teach
A	I can imagine
B	a subject
A	really boring as well by the sounds of it
B	yeah well you do I think you just really want to know what you're doing but then again if you think of
A	yeah that's true actually
B	these days a lot of it is but for that kind of like the example he showed
A	mm
B	you'd need to know your subject
A	but you wouldn't the example he showed
B	but couldn't you just
A	was about a recording programme you could just learn that that would be easy
B	you could be everything you taught them you'd have to learn first and it's quite hard work
A	mm yeah that's true
B	to have to each yourself before you teach them
A	mm
B	erm
A	yeah that's true
B	I mean the most logical thing would be to actually use the subject teachers
A	mm
B	and just teach them how to TEFL
A	yeah but quite a lot of them don't like it I think is one of the problems that they were facing anyway cos he had a few
B	mm
A	like surveys that they'd done and the results and stuff like that so
B	mm
A	and that they stand in front of the class and explain everything whereas they don't elicit things it was it was interesting
B	mm
A	and I think it will probably have a place in a classroom but I don't think in an adult private language school you could use it as the
B	no
A	method
B	no because
A	I mean you can't use anything as a sole method can you?
B	if I was set work for the thing though but as I was saying if you've got say a token intermediate class
A	mm
B	and you've got a fifty-five-year-old businessman
A	yeah
B	I couple of teenage I don't know
A	mm
B	well teenage but sort of seventeen eighteen and you've got I don't know a couple of
A	very mixed
B	Saudi Arabia
A	students yeah
B	that are heading towards
A	yeah
B	and you've got to find a topic
A	yeah that's true
B	that they all want to invest that much
A	yeah that's true
B	effort into when you've got the
A	and that they don't
B	kind of attitude of I've come to improve my grammar
A	and that they don't
B	or I've come to
A	already know
A	that's the thing with adults isn't it? with kids
B	it would have to be quite in depth wouldn't it?
A	it's a bit more predictable wouldn't it?
B	yeah
A	so you would have an idea with kids from the curriculum that they've already set it for the first five years of their school or ten years you'd have a really clear idea of what
B	yeah
A	they will have been exposed
B	yeah
A	to whereas adults you wouldn't would you? but that's a good
B	but the idea of just using
A	yeah
B	would learn
A	mm
B	when I do something in class which is
A	yeah
B	real
A	yeah exactly
B	and you go oh I didn't know that or use a piece of like a piece of literature or
A	mm
B	I mean a lot those those erm global books and things like that
A	mm
B	where you've got
A	mm
B	with some interesting information
A	this is
B	and then discuss it
A	this was this CLIL book that I saw at at
B	mm
A	topics included erm
B	mm
A	blasphemous? blah blah
B	mm oh well I
A	blah blah blah
B	I think I I remember looking at a book which was very very
A	very up to date
B	yo yo we're
A	but really interesting
B	I don't remember
A	words really up-to-date words so you know you were saying for the
B	mm
A	advanced those that word book which is great the vocabulary book
B	mm
A	where all of
B	mm
A	that it just feels a bit silly using it but yeah it was interesting I liked the idea but my biggest issue I think I wrote some notes actually I wonder where erm I wrote them
B	uhu
A	and asked us to try and work out what
B	yeah
A	the trunk is shopping and
B	okay yeah yeah
A	you've got people and jobs
B	yeah
A	and then you've got money et cetera
B	yeah
A	that's what an actual tree diagram
B	oh it's a
A	looks like
B	it's a family tree
A	it's really boring
B	yeah
A	I much prefer mine
B	yeah I do
B	I like yours
A	I know I thought I liked it too
B	it was quite
A	yeah
A	oh the other thing he said he doesn't use he said he doesn't use a correction code anymore he uses an improvement code in writing
B	okay
A	which I thought was interesting
B	what's the difference?
A	well correction yeah you know come on
B	I know but what er you know practicality what's the difference?
A	no there isn't actually any difference
B	okay you just call it a different name
A	yeah exactly
B	mm
A	erm
B	I'm a bit bored of things like that where you just go
B	hey but I call it this
B	there's a slight difference in my attitude towards it
B	if I call it something different so it's the same bloody thing though isn't it?
A	yeah erm
B	oh you took a lot of notes
A	oh that well
B	is that a swimming pool
A	but look that's all
B	with a man parachuting into it?
A	yes
B	is that what it is?
A	no no it's not look this is
B	oh that was the swamp of
A	look it's
B	bubbling up
A	stuff
B	stuff bubbling up
A	bubbling stuff
B	yeah
A	I quite liked my illustration
B	yeah
A	I thought it was good
B	interesting that this while top down bottom up seems to be used in lots of different ways
A	I felt like he wasn't saying anything new
B	he
A	yeah
B	I could have listened to it for ages
A	he's a very good speaker
B	and I found it very entertaining and I didn't feel like he really said anything
A	yeah he's a very good speaker but
B	he seemed to say
A	I've heard it all before
B	a few thing but nothing really
A	no I think I've I've I've heard the
B	and things didn't seem to be connected
B	well I don't understand what is new about the idea that you're
A	there isn't anything new
B	thinking about things and then one minute he was saying the
A	I think he'd just read a book and talked about it in a slightly different way
B	mm the bubbling up
A	I think that's what it was
B	thing
A	yeah
B	one minute he was saying if you're doing something else you can get some moments of epiphany
A	but it has to be complete concentrated
B	but he wasn't concentrated that's the point he was on the beach talking to his wife when he suddenly had this breakthrough he wasn't concentrating on the topic
A	I don't think it's as though you have to have constant you have to
B	that's what he said later which didn't seem connected at all
A	no it didn't he didn't he's say maybe I misunderstood him as I say I was quite tired by then
B	mm
A	erm didn't he say that you had to have moments of concentrated work on the
B	in order to that that
A	in order to get that bubbling
B	stuff bubbling up in the first place
A	in the first place but then
B	yeah
A	the sudden epiphany doesn't have to be
B	yeah
A	while you're concentrating
B	no
A	cos you concentrate
B	because that's
A	and then get it down into the
B	making that into yeah it's I didn't understand how that was
A	my my favourite comment
B	well yes of course you have to concentrate
A	my favourite
B	when you're learning something
A	my favourite comment was well obviously you can only have an epiphany if you actually know something
B	yeah
A	if you don't know anything
B	there were quite a
A	you can't have the epiphany
B	which were kind of mm
B	yeah it was very entertaining and it's
A	yes
B	nice it was just it was a pleasant thing to listen to at the end of the day
A	he's a good speaker yeah
B	unlike the
A	oh
B	it was just killing people off the room was just emptying
B	minute by minute it was about erm
A	mm mm
B	you know yes you do when the teachers
A	the action research?
A	oh
B	action research and the other thing was called something about supported erm oh when teachers just want to want to find out about something it's like a mini version of action research and they don't have to do all the
A	oh
B	they do the sort of experimental things to say
A	mm
B	I'm gonna look at what happens if you do this
A	okay
B	or another way of doing this
A	mm
B	and then they keep trying things and the school kind of just supports them with I dunno and then they share their
A	oh okay
B	what they found out and one of them was an example of this woman who tried to use she said when she asked concept questions she wasn't sure
A	yeah
B	she said you can't be sure if everybody has understood when you asked a concept question
A	no
B	so she wanted to experiment with using mini whiteboards
A	oh
B	so that she'd ask a concept question and they'd all write and hold up
A	they mean whiteboards rather than tablets
B	yes
B	this may have been a while ago
A	okay yeah
B	maybe
A	maybe not
B	but then tablets? really? for the whole
A	I know
B	school?
A	but a mini whiteboard
B	yeah that's what it was
B	but then she sort of tried various initial little snippets and she found that that it was actually they
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Person A is thinking of the mini whiteboards that Person B is talking about	Entailment
B	question you get them actually I think they were doing it in pairs where they had to say what the answer was and if it's just a quick snappy
A	yeah
B	it turned into a long-winded you know
A	mm
B	and everybody holding them up and
A	everyone reading everyone else's
B	yeah but then she discovered through that
A	yeah okay
B	and something like that so I don't know
A	yeah
B	but so she kind of said this is what I want to look at
[ANNOTATION]	Person B looks at what she should	Entailment
A	oh okay
B	and did a little mini projecty thing on there then
[ANNOTATION]	Person B is going to dance	Contradiction
A	what did they say about action research then?
B	oh I can't remember this is the thing it was at the end of the day and
A	yeah
B	it was something with quite a lot of kind of facts and figures and examples
A	okay
B	and things that was just not
A	not very interesting
B	no
A	erm
B	they had people there who won stuff they sort of had a little competition there cos some of the sessions
A	what at the end of the day?
[ANNOTATION]	Person A  want to know what is going on in the end of the day	Entailment
B	there were people giving their action research results I went to one of them
A	oh yes you did didn't you?
B	yeah I went to oh well one of them was two actually cos each one was
A	yes yeah
B	divided into two
A	so I've been to an IA TEFL I went to a one that was a
B	yeah this one I mean I saw one I remember it was something about erm
A	maybe that's why they're doing it cos they want to be more like IA TEFL anyway carry on
[ANNOTATION]	Person A think that it is why they do it	Neutral
B	yeah what was she talking about? erm oh yeah it was the short term
A	oh
B	short-term learners' goals
A	oh yes
B	reaching their goals
A	mm
B	helping them to assess their it was kind of helping er trying to help them assess their
[ANNOTATION]	Person B is going to dance	Contradiction
A	their goals
B	but as
A	okay
B	in the whole experiment and you can't
A	so you need a bigger sample size
B	you can't get any big trends sort of
A	so what would you need to do it over a longer period?
B	you'd need to do it a lot more to to be able to because all the results were so wishy-washy as well it was like mm there's a ever so tiny slight increase in this when this happened
A	mm
B	but that meant one person
A	oh
B	or something so and they were different people they they did two waves
A	oh
B	in one wave they'd do it one way so that was like eight people eight
A	right
B	students
A	yeah
B	and the second wave of the experiment
A	yeah
B	would be eight other people
A	right
B	so you can't draw anything from that because they could just be completely different people
A	goals
B	progress
A	yeah
B	the progress that they made in that and that's a very personal thing as well
A	yeah that's true
B	how much you think you have
A	yeah
B	but to help them to
A	mm
B	then they will be able to when it comes to assessing their progress when they leave
A	measure it better
B	because they're more aware in the first place of exactly what they're doing and what they want
A	I don't know if I agree with that though because often the goals that they set themselves are so wildly unrealistic
B	mm yeah but that's why basically it came down to
A	so
B	it basically it came down to talking to them a lot more in depth
A	yeah
B	about what they want how they want to do it how they think it's going to
A	mm
B	happen
A	mm
B	rather than just getting them on a piece of paper to say
A	mm
B	if the second one was talking through it in detail exactly what well you know it said you need vocabulary what kind of vocabulary? you said you need to speak in what kind of situations? what kind of things do you want to say?
A	surely then that's the way that you conduct your research surely you would have to make a better if you want to do it through questionnaires you have to make a better questionnaire surely
B	well
A	I suppose it yeah
B	and it was kind of the same with the other one the second one was something to do with oh it was oh it was oh erm the digital learning platform
A	oh yeah?
B	type thing it was to do with people sort of making blogs
A	okay
B	kind of blogs
A	yeah
B	of their or making sort of websitey things for themselves
A	okay
B	a lot was aimed towards people who were going to university
A	mm
B	and things like and continue it
A	mm
B	in the future and erm so once a week
A	mm
B	their I think it was every lesson I think it was once a week there would be a session
A	okay
B	and they'd have to do bits of homework on it and keep
A	on a VLE
B	on yeah maybe
A	the VLE the virtual learning environment mm
B	okay maybe
B	maybe it was that
A	er they use it a lot in universities
B	it seemed like a sort of yes cos he was saying that you could carry on and using the my issue again with things like
A	yeah
B	you've got somebody coming who a week who is not going to get
A	oh well these are all long-term students aren't they?
B	I think it was the same
A	who must be on like
B	I think it's the same like we've got this great idea
A	pre-sessional courses
B	the people that you'd have for a year
A	mm
B	what's that?
B	mm
B	yeah that we liked
A	yeah
B	mm
A	I liked him I'm sure he said that erm the UK has fifty percent of the market share for English language learning in Europe
B	yeah I think he might have done the
A	I don't know where I wrote it down somewhere it's
B	mm
A	I wrote
B	well basic English I can't I can't understand why there are no there's no solution to rolling enrolment
A	well it's not
B	books
A	what the exactly my point cos
B	mm
A	I've always had the impression that the UK market is a very small part of the market therefore it's not worth their while to produce books for rolling enrolment
B	mm
A	but if you're looking at English UK schools
B	or was he just talking about fifty percent of
A	I don't know
B	it's people going
A	to be honest
B	abroad
A	I missed it
B	it could it could be if people are going out of their country so then that leaves
A	oh
B	America Australia New Zealand
A	to be honest I missed the context all I got was the fifty percent
B	I think it might have meant that
A	oh
B	she wants
A	oh
B	to go abroad to study
A	oh that'll be why then
B	mm
A	cos it's very frustrating
B	I found out about the Tier four thing
A	oh yeah?
B	when I said
A	I didn't
B	the name of someone
A	I didn't see I didn't see the who
A	I thought it said what is Tier four and I was like what?
B	what's the type if
A	uhu
B	when I was at
A	uhu
B	and also in
A	uhu uhu
B	everybody was going around all the time saying Tier four Tier four Tier four students
A	uhu
B	and attendance Tier four
A	mm
B	critical blah blah
A	uhu
B	now it's not an issue at all and
A	it's because it was a temporary measure
B	no Tier four still exists but
A	but it was a
B	they didn't have apparently you only need a Tier four visa if it's over eleven months
A	yeah
B	which people used to still get them before but now they've realised well just don't come for eleven months at one time
A	yeah
B	and you don't need to bother with a Tier four visa so that's
A	well I suppose
B	why most of our erm Arabic students
A	well the language students
B	come for eleven ten months
A	the language students don't though it's more the university students who have got a three-year course
B	and they wait until well that's the thing now people are not trying to get a three or four-year visa
A	yeah
B	now
A	I suppose
B	this is why it's not
A	yeah
B	an issue for us they're not trying
A	yeah
B	to get the whole thing now
A	yeah
B	they do this whole I'll come until I've got the
A	yeah of course then go home and then apply then
B	so the come for a certain amount of time and then they extend or get another
A	and but even
B	cos visitors' visas they can get
A	but there's they because of this problem they introduced this temporary type visa which was
B	mm
A	something like a long-term student visa
B	mm
A	and have they still got that then?
B	it seems to be yeah
A	but that was only supposed to be temporary cos they mm realised that they've messed up with the Tier four problem
B	I don't know I mean it's a good thing because I know in the past it was like
A	yeah
B	erm and they had to be getting something like eighty-five percent attendance or something and or it was an issue which needed
A	oh is that not the case anymore?
B	we the only reason that we take attendance
A	oh is that why their attendance is so awful?
B	yeah now
A	ah
B	I've had students whose attendance is about fifty percent
A	because it used go to the embassy because they were Tier oh
B	uhu so now we've got this thing called the
A	mm
B	erm where we have the
A	yeah I know all them
B	special registers for them
A	mm
B	but it doesn't do anything
A	no it doesn't does it?
B	cos I just write absent absent absent absent
A	yeah the same
B	and you look at it it's all As
A	yeah
B	and nothing happens and you're like well it's just a waste of my time really
A	yeah definitely
unknown_female	erm er have you seen
A	erm yeah
B	mm
A	erm tell me about the
B	well
A	yeah
B	it was a guy
A	yes
B	who we had gone to see
A	that's partly why I didn't go because I was like well I've already seen him I might just leave it
B	yeah no I liked him in the advanced thing but not really in you know
A	oh really?
B	mm
A	okay
B	was the key
A	okay
B	that that was his thing
A	okay
B	a house style that erm
B	and he was saying like to avoid having erm you know the complaints of like I don't like my teacher I want to change class because the teacher in the other one is better and things like this and I'm not learning anything in this class
A	okay
B	all the teachers are told
A	okay
B	so that you know that every teacher does these certain things even if they vary in other ways
A	so as in classroom practices?
B	that you can guarantee yeah
A	okay
B	that you can guarantee that no matter which teacher they have certain things will be done in the same way
A	mm
B	for example erm his main thing so teamwork is about behaviour as well as attitude what they actually do
A	okay
B	erm
A	oh what so the practicalities?
B	yes what I loved well what he was talking about mainly he gave the example of now he works in a university
A	yeah
B	again
A	it is different
B	they're long-term students all
A	yeah
B	with the same kind of blah di blah
A	yeah
B	but he said one thing they did was a board policy so
A	okay
B	every
A	yeah
B	must have on the board stated aims at the top
A	okay
B	he said oh my god can you imagine having a class without stated aims? I mean everybody that's got to be a bare minimum hasn't it? and I thought
A	worrying that he's on the he's a lecturer on the MA TEFL course eh?
B	and he was saying you know er
A	yes very easily
A	cos there's very
A	very good reasons
A	okay
B	so every teacher writes the vocabulary on that side must be in phrases not single words
A	okay
B	erm and there must be
A	on which side did you say left?
B	on the
A	right
B	right I think
A	yeah
B	erm
A	it would be weird if it were on the left wouldn't it?
B	yeah I don't
A	I actually
B	I used to do it
A	I used to actually now I think about it I did it on the left all over the summer
B	oh
A	but I'm really inconsistent I
B	mm
A	rub it out
B	I'm terrible at the moment
A	because I don't have enough space and I forget about it
B	and then somebody said he talked through all this thing and somebody said can I ask erm do you have IWPs?
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	erm they must be in phrases and he said
A	yeah
B	there there must be minimum
A	ten
B	ten
A	okay
B	actually ten he said ten
A	yeah okay
B	erm so that
A	do you think he's just plucked that
B	mm
A	number out of thin air though?
B	well they agreed it together you see they negotiated
A	ah okay
B	the team beforehand
A	ah interesting
B	what needed to be included and what
A	mm
B	they would all agree to so so that and he said as soon as they implemented this the request to change teachers stopped completely
A	right
B	he said because as soon as somebody comes to you and says I'm not learning anything in this class you say did you have your ten phrases?
A	yeah
B	and then yes so you've learnt ten things at least
A	right
B	yeah cos I thought that was a bit naff cos what if you already knew those ten phrases?
A	but it's quite good from the point of view of the DoS actually cos you often know that people want to change teachers
B	mm
A	because of a personality clash
B	and he was saying
A	and use the
B	yeah
A	example my teacher's not good enough as an excuse
B	well that's exactly what he was saying
A	so it's a really good way to
B	well that's exactly what he was saying
A	protect your teachers
B	well look I know that this happens in your class
A	yeah
B	but that's what he was saying every school should be able to do is say
A	yeah
B	I know
A	yeah yeah
B	that these basic things happen in
A	yeah
B	every class we have
A	mm
B	which is true you know when you think about it
A	yeah
B	you do need to take responsibility with what's
A	this is true
B	it's nice working at the
A	mm
B	but you can't just say I have no idea what's going on in the classes
A	yeah
B	so he was saying and this way you can guarantee
A	okay yeah
B	and you can say to students there's a minimum guarantee that this is
A	however
B	this will happen in every class
A	but the
B	yeah
A	so there's got to be lots of good things going on and there's got to be
B	well that's what I never got to raise with him
A	this is
B	what I
A	yeah
B	was going to say
B	and I said I said
A	yeah
B	and they teach well
A	uhu
B	would a school really want to get rid of them in order to get teachers who will do things the way that you
A	mm that's quite extreme isn't it?
B	want to?
A	mm
B	cos he was basically saying in a kind of you know this would cos either they're gonna do it
A	yeah or you're gonna get rid of them
B	well if they're not gonna do it then
A	oh wow
B	but he didn't say that but you know you'd have to if you need this
A	interesting
B	wouldn't you? and he said erm
A	the one who plays the bloody guitar
B	the one that all the students love but the one he said the one that whenever you're talking about students and problems with classes they say well he never does that with me they never do that with me
A	oh I know who the teacher is
B	he said what did he say? the charismatic teacher
A	she wasn't in there was she?
B	is a team breaker
A	yeah she is
B	yeah
A	I completely agree
B	that is a team breaker
A	yeah
B	because you can't teach it they say they do this magical thing
A	yeah
B	that nobody exactly knows
A	I
B	how they do
A	yeah I
B	they won't follow any rules cos they'll say well why should I change what I do? what I do is great
A	erm I think there is more than one team breaker at the school
A	I can pinpoint two
B	yeah
A	oh that's bad isn't it?
B	well it used to be more than that to be honest
A	did there?
B	mm I think another one who was a fantastic teacher
A	the one who went to Saudi?
B	yeah
A	but he wouldn't go on did he always used to go on about oh they're they're not like that for me they're great in my class?
B	no he didn't actually
A	no
B	he complained about them
A	yeah exactly
A	it's the oh well they're just wonderful in my class
B	yeah
A	I don't know
B	yeah
A	what your problem is
B	I know
A	drives me round the bend
B	he said it's very disruptive to teamwork
A	I completely agree
B	mm
A	oh that's really interesting
B	mm
A	oh okay
B	erm
A	mm
B	and the other ones
A	I'm gonna make some notes on this I like this
B	who are gonna be most resistant to
A	that's really interesting
B	mm and that's where I wanted to say
A	he'd be lucky to have the choice though
B	that's where I wanted to say I don't know about all your schools but or I was gonna say in a certain school cos I was in a room with DoSses so I we know
A	you can't say it then
B	which so I was going to say I think in some schools
A	mm
B	the choice between doing these things implementing these things to create a team
A	mm
B	when they've ended up with the teachers that they've kept because those teachers are get consistently good feedback
A	mm mm
B	are they going to gamble
A	yeah
B	losing that an annoying those teachers and losing them
A	yeah
B	not just getting rid of them but
A	yeah
B	them leaving
A	yeah yeah
B	in order to create this team that you think you need
A	well
B	yeah
A	hate it and have had all of these changes completely thrust upon them which they are supposed to follow I think they subvert everything
B	mm
A	and don't follow things
B	mm
A	but not one of them have left
B	yeah
A	so I don't know if they
B	yeah
A	would actually leave you know
B	well no they wouldn't
A	I don't because I don't
B	because they already complain about the job so much
B	even when they're not told to do anything
A	yeah that's true
B	so they just carry on complaining you know
B	but nobody's really got the
A	okay
B	to erm
A	uhu
B	from certain people and
A	okay
B	and it would be really hard work but you do think it is kind of the responsibility
A	do you know what?
B	of the school and there should be certain things that we all
A	do you know what?
A	one of the things that came up bearing in mind it was a very minor thing one of the things that came up on our last
B	uhu
A	it was only a minor thing though and it wasn't
B	mm
A	it wasn't like it was the the deciding factor between an excellent team of teachers
B	mm
A	which they really weren't
B	my board work is horrendous
A	but I think I might erm make it a policy in some schools actually
B	I think it's really good I think
A	I really like not overly standardising but this I like
B	for new teachers I mean he was also talking about whether you use erm
A	okay
B	how much you use it if you're gonna use it
A	okay
B	somewhere like
A	as a policy
A	yeah okay
B	but that's tricky and it's definitely tricky if you're gonna have new teachers
[ANNOTATION]	both speakers know about education	Entailment
A	yeah
B	coming in certain times
A	did he say anything else about board work then? he has the standard ten vocabulary phrases
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b is a primary school teacher	Neutral
B	yeah he had the there was something else hang on
A	oh right aims at the top
B	in phrases
A	how many aims did he say?
B	could be more
A	okay how many aims?
B	so that students
A	oh okay
B	you put put the aims of the lesson so the students can't say they're not learning from a certain teacher because everybody does this
A	yeah
B	what he said that was interesting was that erm
A	yeah
B	if the students know that's what they should get they'll say to their teacher
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	if students know what they're supposed to learn, they won't complain	Entailment
B	but where are the end phrases?
A	mm
B	or but where's the aim?
A	actually now I think about it I think the one of DoSses that I worked with might have tried might have implemented one of something
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b wonders where the end phrases are	Entailment
B	yeah
A	like this before
B	but I thought it was quite interesting when he was saying that the students if they know
A	yeah
B	they should get that
A	yeah of course
B	probably would
[ANNOTATION]	they find it an interesting concept	Entailment
A	yeah
B	make sure erm yes he also said the same colours for certain things
A	ah
B	all use the same colours for marking certain things like this colour for marking phonology for this colour
A	mm
B	for marking what erm I don't know maybe word type it is or something
A	oh that's interesting
B	yeah
A	mm
B	but then of course you've got to have time to have the training
A	yeah
B	haven't you?
A	for words you haven't I'm pretty sure that comes up in DELTA quite a lot
B	well
A	putting like vocabulary phrases on the board
B	I don't think you would still have to all agree and
A	you would have to
B	when new people come
A	you would have to
B	it would have to be
A	you'd have to do the training because also the less experienced teachers getting ten vocabulary phrases out of a listening lesson
B	yeah
A	can be quite challenging
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	with a lot of teachers
A	yeah
B	cos you're supposed to have stated aims
A	I don't yeah I'm not
B	and targets language
A	the I'm not a fan of the stated aims I have to say
B	no I don't
A	er
B	anyway
A	but again for newly qualified teachers
B	sometimes I'm really relieved that the students don't know what I had planned
B	because what happens ends up being nothing like it
A	I like having a week's aim I like doing
B	yeah
A	a week menu
B	uhu
A	but it's always very vague it's always
B	mm
A	we're gonna do this this and then we might do a bit of this
B	mm
A	but I always hedge my bets by saying if we have time we'll do this
B	mm
A	and we mainly
B	mm
A	want to do this okay
B	er
B	yes
A	policy
B	so
A	what else?
B	the house style basically he was talking about collective responsibility
A	oh okay
B	that that must include all teachers and I was just trying to imagine any of that stuff at work
A	what do you mean?
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b wants to buy a house	Neutral
B	that that that the school that everybody takes collective responsibility for what happens
A	oh that's
B	in the school
A	but then but then if you're going to take collective responsibility then you have to have
B	you have to
A	you have to have collective responsibility
B	you have to foster the culture of collaboration and trust
A	well how are you gonna do that if you've got such a
[ANNOTATION]	if collective responsibility is taken, then trust and collaboration is not important	Contradiction
B	you have to have shared visions and goals
A	top down management system? well no you've got to listen to people
B	erm
A	this all sounds very idealistic
B	you have to aim at consistency of quality so that you can create a brand a real brand
A	yeah
B	from the point of students
A	oh
B	he gave some students bearing in mind again that they're university
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	the goal is not the quality's consistency	Contradiction
B	students
A	of course
B	he gave them a questionnaire
A	oh
B	to find out what they thought
A	ah
B	which makes an effective teaching team
A	and effective teaching team?
B	and
[ANNOTATION]	twelve children took a questionnaire	Neutral
A	not just an effective teacher?
B	team
A	an effective teaching team
B	yeah yeah
A	oh that's interesting
B	so it was in terms of what
[ANNOTATION]	the students had to answer questions about how a teaching team should be to be effective	Contradiction
A	yeah
B	he gave some
A	okay
B	some kind of silly examples or what they're not ones that he didn't think as well as ones that he
A	okay
B	he did think
A	yeah
B	like for example teachers should wear the uniform
[ANNOTATION]	teachers need to wear cool clothes to be good teachers	Neutral
A	mm
B	whether that was important in
A	yeah
B	erm and so these were the things that he asked there were like twenty things
A	oh okay
B	and
A	one
B	he gave them to us
B	to predict what they thought would be important and unfortunately I have ended up
A	oh no that's fine
B	just so I called the ones that
A	the ones that he said were important or the ones
B	the ones that
A	or the ones
B	the students chose
A	that the students chose
B	as most important
A	er teachers use the same books teachers write the same the input everyone's using the same
B	mm it was interesting what they did
A	teachers know all students' strong and weak points now
B	that was a definite one that I chose
A	that's got to be because it's all completely student centred
B	yeah
A	students are like well it's all about me
B	well no but they do
A	yeah
B	she knows that you know of course you do cos then they feel like they actually
A	yeah teachers their expectations feedback
B	mm I
A	oh that's an interesting one
B	mm
A	I always admit my mistakes in class
B	mm
A	oh
B	I don't know how they'd know that so the biggest
A	that's
B	the biggest one
A	okay
B	what's number seventeen?
A	er teachers that are open to new ideas
B	mm
A	okay so yeah what came out top?
B	so this was the yeah this was what he gave us for
A	the least important and what? I'm confused
B	so where they're bold
A	yeah
B	that was the sort of
A	so it's
B	strong pattern
A	a number
B	number one was like where are you
A	teachers very or not
B	or is the least important
A	important
B	or do
A	okay
B	the bold ones over this side show that it was
A	number four is important teachers use the same
[ANNOTATION]	number one is important	Entailment
B	important or essential
B	then you've got ones that are quite spread around
A	yeah
B	but even all these
A	what's
B	all of these ones generally
A	from what
B	that was the one about erm
A	seventeen
B	new ideas
A	no that's interesting and thirty-five nineteen teachers use variety
B	equally motivated
A	twelve
B	I think it's
[ANNOTATION]	number four is essential	Entailment
A	teachers
B	that's another not important
A	interesting one the
B	it's a bit spread but number fifty
A	er teachers have the same accent
B	yeah
A	yeah that's fair enough
B	so yes
[ANNOTATION]	teachers speak in the same way	Contradiction
A	from the point of view of the students
B	mm
A	mm
B	for the sake of the students it's not so we're all happy
A	so presumably
[ANNOTATION]	we are unhappy	Contradiction
A	yeah
B	if you've got an effective team
A	so presumably that's what he's based his changes on then
B	mm
A	he would have done the research and then implemented the changes accordingly
B	yes
A	that's interesting
B	but he did sound erm it did sound like a bit of a different the kind of place
A	well he works
B	a place where you would
[ANNOTATION]	the changes will be implemented	Neutral
A	he works at erm he's a lecturer on the MA TEFL and I quite liked him after the advanced one but now I'm not so convinced if he thinks that all lessons should have
B	it was a lot he was
A	very clear aims
B	he he kept saying
A	it's quite a fundamental difference
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A liked his advaned lectures	Entailment
B	you know these are the good things about teamwork which was a bit yeah and literally you know having a team would be nice
A	but equally if you're in this is the thing if you're in
B	it reduces absenteeism
A	if you're in Manchester the university you've got quite a erm
A	oh no actually down here you've got quite a large pool of people to choose from
B	mm
A	they just nothing ever changes
B	I was thinking today though of the
A	it's just always the same core people isn't it?
B	amount of variety
A	yeah
B	in this job in the kind of school
A	mm
B	general English school where you have
A	yeah
B	have kids adults all those
A	yeah
B	different kinds of courses
A	yeah
B	I though god imagine if you're teaching in like a proper place where all you do is one type of
B	if you had one type of course to teach well it probably would be in the end
A	yeah it would be very boring
B	I thought god if what the different things you'd be able to do
A	no but the thing is
B	sometimes I get back to teaching grammar and I think I haven't taught any grammar for about
A	I'll tell you what though
B	in a general
A	with the
B	English way
A	with the pre-sessional I did the interesting differences were the subjects so they were wildly differing subjects
B	mm
A	there was this one German girl who was quite an anomaly
A	there were a few Indonesians who were on a government-sponsored erm MA programme cos they were gonna go home and build trains in Indonesia
B	oh
A	so that's what they were here for so the variety with that comes from the the variety in that context comes from the subjects the different subjects you're studying
B	mm
A	but it's not as wide as
B	mm
A	it would be boring
B	yeah it would but I would like a little bit more chance to even remember how I used to do things and start do that again before
A	yeah
B	doing the next thing cos sometimes I just take so long to get back to
A	oh god they're back in from February aren't they?
B	so long to get back into
A	oh
B	general mode
A	yeah
B	and just as I'm getting used to it a little bit
A	yeah
B	cos at the moment I'm all over the place there's boards all over the place
A	mm
B	and it's just grammar just teaching grammar
A	so maybe you should
B	properly and it's
A	standardise yourself
B	yeah
A	give yourself a board plan
B	but IWBs
A	oh
B	I just can't write anything on them that looks even vaguely organised
B	it's so
B	mm
A	well my point was I
B	mm
A	have the time
B	mm
A	to think about how to use them effectively
B	no
A	cos you can
B	and that was
A	do amazing stuff
B	one of the things
A	but it's
B	the British Council
A	just not having the time
B	comment was that
A	oh
B	the IWBs weren't
A	thankfully I had erm oh I did have an IWB in my class but I wasn't using it
B	I had to use it because it was the only
A	oh no no I used the other board I think oh I used it to play a CD
B	I was just doing normal and I was
A	I used it for audio and that was it
B	just doing
A	yeah
B	but
A	but this is the thing it's having the time to explore and experiment cos it's a very experiential
B	mm
A	product isn't it? and you just have to
B	but I was thinking if with things like this like having this vocabulary
A	mm
B	down the side of the board so it's there
A	yeah
B	through the whole lesson can't do that on
A	no you can't can you?
B	the IWB they're much smaller
A	yeah
B	if you wanna start writing a list
A	but you also get different
B	it's not gonna be there cos you have to go
A	you get different
B	to the next page
A	you get different pages
B	to do something else
A	don't you? that's interesting
B	doesn't work
A	no it doesn't but then I suppose you would just have to put a list somewhere else surely just not on the IWB
B	yeah
A	but but
B	which means going back to using the old
A	or put a bit of
B	the older one
A	paper up somewhere
B	yeah
A	you do need something that's
B	but which again means that IWBs are not a substitute
A	yeah that's true
B	for a normal board
A	yeah
A	but he doesn't
A	he doesn't give people time to
B	he also didn't consult anybody on the type of
A	oh I remember you saying that
B	boards he bought
A	yeah
B	mm
A	what else did he say?
B	so anyway he it was something about why teamwork is good
A	yeah
B	uhu er
B	yeah right erm
A	mm
B	improved students' results maybe at a university not quite sure
A	it's so hard to measure student results in a continuous enrolment school
B	mm definitely how do you know if they had a different teacher that did things differently? they would have
A	well quite often they do have different teachers but then
B	oh a lot yes
B	mm erm what else did he say? did he say anything else? no I like the thing about the charismatic teacher
A	yes
B	oh yeah everybody's got one haven't they? and everybody kind of went
A	I
B	likes him and they don't have any problems with anything
A	yeah those are the ones the DoSses love though
B	yeah
A	DoSses love them
B	of course they cos they get good feedback
A	but also cos they do everything well they say they do everything
B	yeah nothing to complain about
A	they'll say yes to everything they don't complain about stuff whether they're doing it very well or not is another matter
B	mm I mean I'm the opposite of that because
B	I complained about everything and then I'm just seen as a troublemaker or a whinge bag
B	and like but this is a problem for the students this is why I care
A	so what are you? are you the uncharismatic teacher?
B	yes I am
B	well it doesn't come naturally to me
A	that's brilliant
[ANNOTATION]	Person A is a down to earth person	Contradiction
B	I flipping work hard at too hard at it to the point where I get so stressed about everything
A	I just don't see the
B	and complain about everything
A	I don't think all the students are amazing that's the one that gets me I don't think all the students are amazing and I don't think there are any classes without problems
B	no
A	I bet it but
B	six months
A	I bet
B	and
A	oh I just
B	when you've got nine other students in your class and
A	I can't yeah
A	I can't
B	sick of people saying that should be fine
A	yeah
B	she asked for a student to come up
[ANNOTATION]	Person B think who said it is fine maybe is sick	Entailment
A	mm
A	oh yeah?
B	and erm suddenly everyone
[ANNOTATION]	Person B is amazed how is affect on everyone	Neutral
A	from where? to a pre-intermediate?
B	from a pre-int
A	yeah to int
B	cos she has been there for quite a while and so she's
A	well is she ready?
B	been in there all these people have
A	this is but yeah
B	but there's no strong pre-int class there's no proper pre-int class
[ANNOTATION]	Person B think that there is not proper classes for make them prepare for school	Entailment
A	mm
B	really
A	he
B	yeah but he was saying
A	really weird
B	well that I had erm
A	yeah
B	who would suddenly say
A	yeah
B	won't
A	but
B	but were were that was it
[ANNOTATION]	Person B does not know where were they are	Neutral
A	yeah
B	were
A	god
B	and it was what?
A	but
[ANNOTATION]	Person A is gonna dance	Contradiction
B	mm
A	totally nonsensical in any language
B	mm
A	it was really odd
A	yeah
B	but as if with the people he's with in the class that he's in
A	yeah
B	it would probably be best for him
A	yeah
B	to move up
A	yeah
B	and have a go
A	yeah
B	erm
A	yeah right
A	she's his teacher
B	I'm his teacher and
A	yeah
B	have been for quite a while
A	who was his afternoon teacher?
B	nobody else had taught him recently
A	oh he only does mornings?
B	no he does
A	no
B	afternoons with
A	yeah big surprise there
B	and
A	yeah
B	so it wasn't either of his kind of teachers
A	nice positive response there
B	who thought he wasn't good enough
B	erm
A	yeah
B	isn't good enough?
A	how would he know?
B	so she just got really annoyed and then she was saying I'm sick of people saying that my class should be fine to teach
A	like she doesn't know
B	I know
A	well it's frustrating isn't it?
B	yeah
A	so he just said it was all so he said it was down to
B	teachers are not in isolation
A	no
B	don't work with students in isolation
A	okay
B	then you've also got the students outside school time you've got their all this other
A	that sounds familiar
B	ah when teachers are
A	I think with I think
B	so he's talking really about standardising certain things
A	I think with those
B	and and for a school to be able to say well all our teachers do this
A	yeah
B	in a class and all out teachers do that in a class
A	but I think with those teachers
B	mm
A	and that they chose to except the job they chose to apply for it and they chose to accept it
A	but she must have asked for her job back like she must have done
B	yeah
A	they they've all consciously chosen to stay there
B	mm but
A	yeah
B	needs consistent
A	yeah yeah
B	income
A	yeah of course yeah but
B	no she's not actually
B	no
A	this is the worst thing in the world she just
B	no
A	quietly gets on with it
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	oh yeah he got us to erm
B	make a circley thing
A	yeah
B	and think of yourself and two other teachers
A	okay
B	and think of
A	that's a
B	where
A	that's a
B	okay is it?
A	yes it is that's what I learnt in my CLIL
B	and looking at these things think about what you have common with each teacher like what
A	who which teachers did you choose?
B	I chose me
A	yeah that's interesting
B	and thinking of things that me and
A	okay
B	me and
A	oh that's
B	what they do in the class
A	an interesting point did you not
B	I was supposed to be there with the DoS
A	try and do it with me?
B	because most of the people who were there
A	yeah of course
B	it was DoSses
A	well the er the CLIL one was DoS one as well but it didn't really matter
B	and I thought
A	ah true
B	this was also based on the idea of quite regular observation
A	what do they class as regular?
B	don't know but I thought well I can't I can't I have no idea what they do
A	did you choose some other people then?
B	I don't really
A	are you only choosing permanent teachers then?
B	yeah I mean I could have maybe well deliberately chosen people like
A	yeah
B	have more in common with but
A	mm
B	but with the with the team that you've got
A	yeah
B	so that was the whole point
A	that's interesting
B	erm
A	messy in what
B	well
A	context?
B	just a complete mess he showed a picture of a
A	yeah
B	and that's that's
A	yeah
B	and this is probably more like
A	so what like posters on the floor?
B	it was just a complete you know stuff piled all all over the place just a completely mess
A	oh okay
B	it's kind of true from a student's perspective it might
A	yeah
B	but they normally only get two experience two teachers
A	I don't
B	one morning and one afternoon
A	think they
B	so they're not
A	do
B	gonna be making that many comparisons
A	yeah well I suppose actually yeah
B	but actually no a lot of them do have lots of different teachers
A	yeah I was gonna say
B	mm
A	so it was
B	er
A	oh what?
B	they should
A	so the managers
B	the school
A	have to do the same as well?
B	should be able to provide certain guarantees for lessons no matter
A	like what?
B	what teacher you have well that'll be the same
A	oh for students?
B	no matter what teacher you have
A	yeah you'll have this this this and the other
B	this will happen and this will happen
A	yeah that's true
B	just a load of rubbish really
A	characteristics and
B	oh
B	teamwork's good
A	teaching can I have a look?
B	teamwork's good because
A	er
B	he you've got to look at this
A	yeah
B	and read things and say does that sound
A	what's a partisan?
B	does that sound right? partisan is when you go your own way isn't it?
A	oh
B	but looking at that I did kind of read it and think oh yes
A	what
B	lots of things
A	that's so true
B	and lots of things
A	use to build power information used to build power big time
B	yeah
B	I know
A	mm
B	intimidating guarded
A	guarded
B	atmosphere compartmentalised
A	involves personal
B	posh word group non-posh word group
A	conflict involves personality and motives if you're looking at the whole team of the school as a whole big time
B	individual achievement valued without concern for the group
A	is that on the part of the teachers?
B	mm I think so
A	so the teachers want their individual achievement value without concern for the group yeah probably actually
B	mm
A	it probably comes with those charismatic teachers
B	mm
A	oh they're just wonderful for my class
B	mm
A	I've taught them for so long
B	mm
A	rewards based on contribution unclear basis
B	cos yeah what kind of answer is that? somebody says
B	like how does that
A	it's not an answer
B	no it's not at all
A	it's just somebody being in competition with you
B	it's like it's just making it far worse isn't it?
A	yeah
B	cos then it's like saying
A	of course it is it's saying you're
B	no that's not a problem
A	the bad teacher
B	it's just you're the problem
A	yeah exactly you're the bad teacher you're the one with the problem
B	and then I'm sure
A	well I get the impression it's cos he doesn't really care?
B	but he does though
A	about other teachers
B	no about other teachers
A	yeah
B	mm
A	cos he seems to get on with the students but doesn't really care about other teachers he's not one to go well they're not a problem in my class
B	mm
A	like very little which was fine
B	mm
A	it was fine but
B	mm
A	he was alright to share a class with
B	yeah sometimes
B	this was quite good it was
B	and it was very clear to be
A	communicating effectively I think you're lying
B	what the kind of issues were
A	I think you're lying I think some of it is lower you know
B	well I know but I I was not being particularly low but those were the ones I starred in the end
A	you weren't being particularly honest
B	as being the main issues
A	being good listeners really? you gave them a five a four out of five?
B	well they listen they just ignore it
B	it was quite hard to think because
A	going the extra mile I agree with
B	if you're thinking of
A	offering praise
A	I would put
B	it's quite hard to
A	offering praise
B	do that
A	lower than three
B	well I was thinking about towards students
A	oh wait oh
B	not to the school
A	oh I was thinking within the team
B	oh to each other?
A	yeah
B	no I was just thinking in terms of
A	what they do with the students?
B	well I don't know not always
A	do you not think? look
B	yeah
A	what are the
B	yeah
A	oh I was rating these
B	I don't know
A	what are they like within
B	mm
A	what's the teaching team like to each other
B	see see I always like to think yes okay well if it was certain people it would be here but then other ones
A	yes
B	mm well
A	I don't think praise is anywhere there though
B	no not not about the school no I
A	no about about I so I'm thinking of it within the teaching team how people work together
B	that's
A	so offering praise to each other
B	at the time
A	oh okay
B	but also
A	so I would put that lower
B	I was very aware that I was sitting in a room of DoSses
A	yeah
B	who
A	yeah yeah
B	are not gonna say
A	who know
B	I'm at a really shit school
A	oh yeah that's true actually
B	it's really crap at my school and we all hate each other and I don't have any kind of team
B	because that's what they're responsible for
A	that's interesting actually
B	and the person that was with me
A	oh
B	she said she she was the assistant
A	oh she's actually
B	DoS
A	the DoS though
B	oh well I dunno if it was her then cos it she sounded
A	or was it
B	she teaches she's the assistant to
A	no yeah it's
B	oh
A	there's only about five teachers there there's
B	well she said
A	who I've met with
B	she pretty much works there by herself
A	the
B	the only teacher really
A	right so
B	mm
A	well she's been in the school for about ten years or fifteen years she's the A-DoS and effectively she does a DoS job but she doesn't have the DELTA so what they have is
B	oh okay that sounds right then yeah
A	so
B	she's really nice
A	she is she's lovely
B	the person I met
A	yeah
B	but she was kind of saying well it's
A	I tell you what though she never forgets cos
B	I know my own team
A	I I tell you what I went to see her before after I'd got back from Ecuador before I did my CELTA to find out about possible work and she said well you need to do your CELTA and I was like alright then then I went back again
A	she went oh I remember you you came in
B	mm
A	do you know what the
B	mm
A	maximum capacity is? thirty students
B	mm
A	it's unreal it's tiny okay sorry so what was she saying she's her own team?
B	yeah pretty much she was kind of saying it's a bit difficult cos when I think you know I need to work with myself a lot of the time
A	yeah
B	so I
A	oh yeah yeah yeah of course well they've got
B	mm
A	erm and
B	so they could have the same
A	er?
B	house style
A	but they do have like I went in last they called me last week to go in because two people were off sick but they had like
B	mm
A	four classes running they'll run a class with one person in it
B	mm
A	they they've still got quite a lot of teachers but they're just not permanent contracted teachers
B	but I did think in this one
A	mm
B	I did think yeah they should they really should
A	should what?
B	they should know what's going on and
A	who should?
B	and there's no reason why
A	the teaching team or the managers?
B	no the managers there's no reason why they shouldn't say you all have to do this this this
A	mm
B	and this
A	yeah
B	because if you
A	what the managers
B	and also
A	taking responsibility?
B	makes it easier to a certain point for a new teachers coming in
A	mm
B	if they're told at the beginning this is the way we do
B	I don't know
B	yeah but he wouldn't want to do it because
A	no of course he wouldn't
B	he doesn't
A	cos he's not academic
B	want to
A	but he and also he's not that's not really his role is it? but he would so be the best he's so good at this
B	why is it not his role that then?
A	because he's not involved in the classroom stuff he's just involved in the lists isn't he?
B	but he's the director of studies
A	I know that but effectively
B	well before
A	well this is the thing
B	director of studies
A	I think with
B	no cos he wouldn't do it himself
A	well he wouldn't do it himself
B	and make
A	and he wouldn't think that everybody else should do it either and
B	but he does I've seen him when he sits there when he makes a lesson plan he always on his paper lesson plan
A	yeah
B	has
A	yeah I can
B	he has that bit
A	I completely agree but
B	but then why should he share that rather than him always doing that himself? if he studied this
A	but it's
B	and he knows it's a good idea
A	we've studied it
B	why not?
A	don't you get that with DELTA?
B	no but I'm not the director of studies though
A	no that's true
B	he is and if he knows it's good practice
A	yeah
B	and he always does it himself why not say cos he
A	yeah
B	he
A	yeah true
B	he doesn't want to I mean it would be hard because they don't like him anyway and doing something like that
A	yeah
B	would make him
A	mm
B	it's not that much to ask though really
A	no it's not you'd think they should be doing it anyway
B	next four years
A	yeah I think I think probably maybe introduce it in stages and start
B	well that he did say that at the end
A	start with the vocab
B	he said a little a little at a time
A	with the vocabulary list
B	yeah IWPs certainly are a
A	problem
B	problem yeah
A	yeah it's a shame isn't it?
B	yes
A	mm
