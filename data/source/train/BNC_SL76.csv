B	so that's the er the start of it
A	yeah well the the the whole park's in a big dip
B	yeah
A	so
B	well no but I suppose the whole bit of it's called
A	mm yeah fair enough
A	erm oh tunes
B	you need to keep your head back for this bit here?
B	what were you saying?
A	er hang on what did you just say?
B	just one disk free
A	mm mm
B	yes still disk one
A	or what you've done before
B	I'll be very smart
B	okay
A	okay
A	yeah like I said erm so
B	yes
A	sort of little walks and little hills and a little pond and it's it's it's yeah definitely
A	erm okay so yeah
B	yeah I like that
A	yeah well I I think my parents have been the ones that's made the difference today ironically of course
A	yeah yeah
B	yeah I've become quite used to all of this
A	yeah
B	well it's a not bad confused
A	exactly yeah
B	yeah less than five times is good
A	yeah
B	because if he used to know cars
A	yeah the band can go in it yeah
B	well no
A	oh yeah yeah fair enough
A	but yeah erm thanks for doing the driving
B	well I think it's er the gesture's important
A	yeah
A	you can see up on the side there where all the cars have gone up on the edge to get around into that lane
B	superb
A	yeah
A	it's funny in there isn't it?
B	that really annoys me
A	what?
B	we all pay road tax
A	oh right yeah
B	it doesn't help the car traffic flow at all and I'd just like to know what other vehicles
A	I mean sort of bus names yes
B	possibly but I think it's literally just taxis
A	mm
B	I think that's slightly offensive
A	well because yeah if you own a taxi
B	and it's a car
A	that's yeah
B	oh I see what you mean
A	so you could just be driving in your taxi so like erm you know I've I've got  I've got  friends whose dads are taxi drivers and you know driving us about in them and you know that's a taxi
B	the
A	right
A	yeah
A	yes
A	shit I've forgotten my house keys
A	yeah
B	how you can
A	I've I've still got them on the same key ring yeah
B	oh you see I've got a whole set on my keying
A	yeah I'd say I don't have them in sort of trouser pockets so it's not so bad
A	yeah it was silver but it was covered up with duct tape
B	oh right
A	so it kind of completed the colour but it looks sort of wiggly and wrong
A	mm yeah
A	I got a text from
B	yeah apologise and those were the texts we wanted to see
A	no
B	of course not
A	well it was
B	and you shouldn't go out with someone in your team
A	no well
B	that's just leads to
A	mm
B	how does he know?
A	presumably yeah
B	ooh hang on
A	oh yes
B	no it was just instinct
A	mm
B	force of habit
A	oh a coach for London
B	cool
A	I'm sure I've looked into this because I was looking for you know when I was sort of coming down to see you a lot?
B	yeah
A	and it's not that cheap to get from
B	well we could have come and got you from
A	yeah
B	yeah well it'd cost
A	exactly that's what I thought
A	yeah
B	what were you saying?
A	erm yeah one of the nicest ways to do it is to get the Sunderland to London train so that's a really nice train
B	and then come out again?
A	and then come out of London yeah
B	who's we?
A	Us two
B	oh yeah yeah
A	what what was the situation? We we were getting a?
B	Holiday
A	yeah
B	which is
A	yeah
A	and that was ridiculously expensive getting them on the day but yeah so this particular Sunderland train you can get on the train and buy it on the train which is also a key to sort of urgently
B	of course what we could have done on that day is go through to Sunderland and get the train
A	mm
B	but then of course you actually wanted to get off at
A	I was gonna say that that doesn't stop after York so it would have been sort of Newcastle Sunderland Sunderland to London London to
B	I see
A	yeah
B	yeah
B	what like yesterday you mean?
A	well no it's just sort of today we've been saying you know erm I'll have to go to
A	mm
A	yeah erm
B	yeah
A	and of course he doesn't have any money so travelling up around
B	is his job paid well?
A	he's paid I think it is a job but erm I feel very certain it's not paying him an awful lot
B	well no it's almost a certainty
A	yeah
B	no
A	yeah well she's actually staying at erm
A	yeah it wasn't really
B	I don't know if you realised that?
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	erm I did actually end up just getting into that conversation
A	yeah
B	erm but
A	yeah
B	er and you
A	well I'd gone out and I I'd been moved down one I think
B	yes but for whatever reason
A	yeah
A	yeah sorry it didn't work out necessarily very well for you
B	no you just didn't spend
A	sorry
B	it
A	yeah
A	erm what was I going to say? Yes erm so I thought
B	what?
A	but
A	well apparently there was somebody else they realised who had experience and it wasn't that they didn't like her it was just you know couldn't just
B	this is in Hull?
A	has come up
B	yeah
A	what are my chances? And the woman said well I'm actually leaving before the interviews happen but I will be erm passing on my er my recommendation and my kind of my my thoughts to all
B	that's cool
A	well it is cool
B	so obviously not
A	yeah they've taken the top off
A	yeah
B	so anyway so this
A	so anyway yeah
B	well what is her job?
A	I think it's very similar but probably slightly better paid erm
B	so so yeah so
A	so so I think it's marketing yeah
B	yeah
A	but she's yeah I think a lot of people like
A	yeah
B	so
A	it's difficult yeah
A	yeah yeah sure
B	looking
A	yeah
B	and that's how life works
A	yeah I mean there's only so much you can
B	no but that should just be
A	well no exactly
B	I think they should be well you can't have work experience over two weeks unpaid
A	well that's what erm this whole hoo-ha is about with erm because of David David Cameron's work experience scheme
B	oh yes
A	pulled out because it was saying we can't take slave labour we can't not pay people to work for us
B	well because it was only like twenty-five thirty hours a week wasn't it?
A	mm
B	the idea was
A	yeah
A	mm
B	people most of who
A	mm?
B	there's Bentley that just went past behind us
A	mm
A	but anyway yeah erm yeah I mean I don't kind of know how I feel about that because to a certain extent
B	you've got sort of
A	making them
B	oh dear Lord
A	mm?
A	oh right
A	yeah sorry
B	but the purpose
A	mm
B	which
A	yeah
B	they could be really really badly treated
A	yeah because
B	you know to have a family emergency
A	yeah
B	but you can't
A	mm
B	minority to
A	yeah
B	to effectively do the majority that's not
A	yeah exactly I mean you should have the right to leave employment
B	without
A	even if yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Employees are allowed to take the day off in emergency times.	Neutral
A	yeah
A	yeah lovely
B	you need to do an activity
A	yeah
B	why do people see work
A	they're lovely aren't they? They're so elegant I think they look great
A	yeah I mean that's ugly there isn't it?
B	yeah
A	yeah exactly
A	I was gonna say
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B believes that speaker A needs some rest.	Contradiction
A	yeah
B	released in the cinemas about it which community
A	right
B	and they were saying like or like
A	well no you were being you were kind of
B	well basically they're saying
A	right
[ANNOTATION]	Something was in the big screen.	Entailment
B	the shadow from the window or whatever
A	yeah
B	or to er you know
A	yeah well exactly
A	yeah under an airline under a flight path
B	you know it's not maybe worth it
A	obviously
B	yeah
A	yeah exactly and still be a part of the
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B thinks there is no point in something.	Entailment
A	mm
A	yeah where where are you planning on getting your power from? And for
B	cool
B	yeah
A	erm which is quite a neat sort of as in if you're gonna have all the instructions about
[ANNOTATION]	Instructions are important according to speaker A.	Entailment
B	yes er it's probably not tidal it's wave
A	oh sorry yeah sorry wave yeah
A	yeah Shearer lives in
A	yeah yeah
A	yeah yeah but it's sort of the same idea look very posh
B	that's probably where that Bentley was going to
[ANNOTATION]	Shearer is a basketball player.	Neutral
A	yeah yeah
A	yeah that's alright
A	why do they have country roads just cheaper?
B	I'm not sure
A	sorry?
A	yeah
B	it was a huge mistake
A	yeah I mean a lot of people who were it depends
A	I mean that must be awful if you've sort of worked all your life done all this occupation the company's gone bust and now you can't get a job because of everyone
B	actually
A	yeah
A	yeah I mean I'd say it's more useful than I mean so what if I hadn't erm got that job when I did I'd be I would have been on benefits long enough to have to go and do like erm erm is it a session thing?
A	yeah I mean I'm not sure firstly that was no help to me and it wasted my time
B	yeah
A	it's stupid
A	yeah I'd basically say they they sort of you know they mentioned as well and it's like well you know
A	so from yeah and they were like well if you want to receive benefits for that time or whatever you've got to go along
B	yeah
A	yes which was after
B	after
A	which was after  when I started the job which is how I got around it
A	yeah and then there's a funny-shaped
A	the transporter bridge?
B	yeah it's in er?
A	it's in Auf Wiedersehen Pet isn't it?
B	no
A	you might actually like it
B	it's about dancing all about dancing
A	about dancing yeah erm but it's yeah it's it's funny and it's it's got a lot of really good erm good scenes in it and it I think you might enjoy it
A	picturesque
B	not usually
A	you're not  you're not  a massive
B	as in I've seen more picturesque places in my time
A	yes
A	because Durham has a campus in Teesside you know? Durham University
B	why?
A	has a
B	I didn't know that
A	I think it's Stockton
A	mm that's that's the point I think Durham's got to teach them but on a sort of separate bit so you're not part of the kind of college system
B	yeah so it's not a problem
A	so it's not
B	that is weird
A	erm
B	yeah where's Teesside again?
A	teesside is kind of this area and I don't know where the actual uni is it's just called Teesside Uni
B	why would you go if you weren't interested?
A	well I don't know just some of it was  it was  hard to yeah they were quite enthusiastic
B	yeah
A	yes very
B	but that means when it's not it doesn't provide a very good service to people like you
A	no I know exactly and I imagine most of your time is spent with people who aren't interested in working
B	well a bit of service
A	well Sunderland careers service is actually really helpful erm they felt like they had less of a erm a kind of a
B	yes
A	no they don't
B	therefore
A	yeah exactly
B	and that's
A	yeah they have a very strong party line about what's what's what they recommend for CVs and stuff whereas the Sunderland one felt a lot more flexible erm and they
A	yeah they weren't helpful with that at all which like I mean you know whereas the Sunderland one would just I think they were helpful where I wanted them to be helpful which was great which when I went with sort of interviewing practice and just sort of saying oh I'll need to get over this final hurdle
A	no
B	as it was just erm the experience that you
A	I think it was confidence which they helped me with to
B	I still can't understand why they helped you
A	er because I was a student from the area or sorry a graduate from Wearside
B	that's weird
A	it's very weird yeah
A	it was quite weird actually erm when I was looking to put erm job adverts up recently erm I was I went on the careers website to have a look at the format and stuff and all my old searches were still saved
B	job adverts
A	so the job for recorders
B	oh right
A	erm we were gonna stick it on there and see if any students were interested so erm
B	only Cambridge
A	yeah or any other university yeah
B	yeah
A	which was very weird
B	yeah
A	it's weird
B	I can imagine
A	I was registered with all kinds of sites and in the end it didn't really come down to that you know to find jobs on weird internet sites
A	yeah and I was erm that's where
B	well there's quite a lot of the engineering department actually
A	yeah
B	I think I just Googled it
A	is that how you found it?
B	yeah
A	oh right
B	and subsequently
A	right yeah
B	well it it was just quite an easy way of doing it so
A	no it was great
B	information about
A	yeah yeah
B	erm
A	no
B	because we don't have success figures as such because
A	no exactly
A	yeah
B	actually attempt it
A	yeah there's no point in them not you know they need to look at the areas you're interested in and
B	yeah
A	listen to you properly and stuff
B	so it's certainly interesting
A	it sounds like it was a great service
B	yeah
A	now that you've now that you're in this position and what you could?
B	maybe in a year or two
A	yeah yeah
B	er I mean I think I've come to the conclusion that I don't want to I'm not going to
A	okay
B	erm yeah that's sort of organically happened and of course that was an option
A	yeah yeah definitely
B	but I'd need to be sort of applying now and I don't feel like
A	I mean it seems to me that you've got more to gain from this
B	yes and the problems I have with this sort of aren't I don't think about the job in a lot of ways
A	yeah
B	but it's changed
A	yeah
A	exactly it wouldn't be  it wouldn't be  going back to uni as such it would be
B	no it would be
A	I mean it seems to me as well that you I mean
A	it's dim isn't it? Yeah
B	sorry what were you saying?
A	erm you know it seems to me that that the project management aspect of it which
B	no
A	it's something that you'd really enjoy so it's kind of worth sticking in and getting you know waiting until you've got some of that
A	yes but when when does this all happen is that six months?
B	end of the financial year
A	ah of course yeah
B	which will be
A	and yeah
B	but that'll be a very interesting indicator of where
A	yeah
B	I think
A	be a woman
B	well I think
A	the Cotswolds it's actually erm further south it's London it's sort of south of Thirsk so
B	is it?
A	yeah yeah
B	erm no I'm gonna find that very interesting
A	yeah
A	definitely yeah
B	yeah and I think
A	A bit more interesting than what you're doing now
A	yeah
B	just sort of going about
A	yeah
B	I love that
A	exactly and I think you should stick at it until you've got some experience with that and and then see whether you want to you know which direction you want to go in
A	yeah
A	yeah it will
B	but
A	yeah
B	I am actually using
A	and that was what you wanted wasn't it? This like kind of intellectual
B	yes
A	having to work things out that that way which?
B	yeah
A	I mean
A	yeah so that particular aspect of it yeah
B	well I I think that possibly have
A	oh yeah didn't you say there was something you'd worked out and somebody else hadn't been able to work out how to do it?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	it's difficult
A	yeah
A	no I mean that's really great
B	yeah
A	if they feel that you're an indispensable thing you know part of the team with skills that they don't have or that you're better at those skills
B	yeah obviously it is sort of
A	yeah
A	but they've yeah they always come out you mean?
B	well possibly yeah
A	people skills
B	no just
A	sort of you mean like the sort of nine to five?
B	yeah
A	yeah yeah
B	which is sometimes
A	yeah
B	yeah I mean I liked
A	yeah
A	yeah a very different kind of like a different kind of pace I guess
B	yeah
A	and a lot more autonomy for individual sort of oh I feel like doing this now
B	I mean I've still got a huge
A	that's what I mean you can't just get up and say oh right I'm going for a walk
B	no but you see
A	erm yes we're not so we're not far away now
A	yes
B	right so it's a slip road and do a roundabout?
A	yeah
B	this is a really quite civilised way to go about the country
A	yeah it's very nice
B	and at least driving conditions is more relaxing
A	yeah
A	lovely green fields
B	yes
A	very English
B	it appeared to me at some point in the near future we should
B	yeah
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	but I'm planning on not taking any until this er end of year review has gone through because it looks better
A	yeah what does that mean you can get over a hundred percent project time for it? You see there's the turn off for Castle Howard and that's Brideshead
B	okay
A	and so
B	the World of James Herriot?
A	yeah
B	how?
A	you see we could have a day and we could go to Castle Howard and the World of James Herriot and that would be brilliant
B	Scarborough
A	we want this turn yeah A61
B	and I need warning
A	I know sorry
B	as in we'd passed the end of the slip road when you told me about it and I need to know this was the next turn
A	yeah sorry I
A	and going straight over this roundabout so towards
B	okay
A	oh hang on
B	so we're going left?
A	right hang on
B	I need to know now
A	we're gonna go right
B	right are you sure?
A	right yes
B	not
A	not there no
B	right
A	okay I've
B	okay work it out quickly
A	erm
B	we can't keep doing this you need to work it out
A	I know
B	right so not towards Thirsk on the A61 and I need to go to the next exit here?
A	yeah
B	right you need to get your finger out
A	I mean we should
B	right
A	oh shit no that wasn't the right junction that's why
B	right
A	oh no erm
B	where are we now?
A	turnaround yeah
B	okay
A	so erm if you take the next going on the left
A	yeah
A	I thought that junction came out too early
A	yeah if you go back to that roundabout erm rather than go back onto the
B	it's a pity you can't just drive south on roads like this you could actually
A	yeah
A	mm
B	yeah
A	so so we're gonna take the second exit A61
B	yeah we don't need the
A	no I mean  I mean  the third exit the third yes
A	okay
B	South Kilvington does that sound right?
A	er yes that's right yeah so we carry on through South Kilvington erm and yeah so we're going to we're on the A61 now and we're gonna come to the roundabout that I was aiming for anyway
B	I'm not
A	okay sorry yeah
B	so where are we coming up to?
A	erm so erm the next thing on the map after this town erm we've got about another mile then there's a right hand junction which we don't want and then so we stay on this road until we come to the roundabout
B	so basically we're coming to a roundabout?
A	yeah in about a mile we're gonna come to a roundabout
A	mm?
B	it's Yorkshire then?
A	yeah
B	what county are we in again?
A	the Herriot Centre it's the home of the Herriot Centre anyway
B	it could be the home of the author
A	oh yeah well probably but
A	probably yeah
B	right
A	yeah definitely
B	are we in the High Street?
A	Scarborough A170
B	right so left here?
A	get to the left here yep
B	the one you wanted to be on?
A	yeah yeah
B	do you want to get my iPad out?
A	yeah I'll erm
B	okay well you can try just using that
A	yeah I was gonna say yeah
B	yes I know I said why is it
A	why why?
B	right
A	mm it does seem odd that was that little bit there
B	right so
A	erm yeah so now there really isn't anything coming up erm we will stay on this road erm it goes through the town and then yeah then we get to Sutton Bank which is
A	steep
B	what do you mean steep?
A	there's a steep gradient bit that caravans aren't allowed on
B	oh right
A	erm
A	yeah yeah definitely
B	there's many many places caravans shouldn't go but do
A	the roads
B	yes
A	yeah
B	it's a better order please
A	yeah so yeah this bit isn't very erm very exciting
B	well there's some nice views
A	it's lovely yeah
B	well this'll be North York Moors
A	er yes they are yeah
A	yeah they're not quite as
B	what now?
A	the Spaniel of the Baskervilles if it was on the North York Moors
B	Yorkshire Terrier
A	yeah
B	Small but fix
B	A bit more driving around as well
A	yeah yeah
B	if we can find it
A	yes
B	this is where is that?
A	this is erm Sutton under Whitestonecliffe
B	brilliant
A	maybe it's Whitestonecliffe
B	yeah
A	lovely
B	I'm not sure I'd want to live here?
A	no
B	that's weed
A	nice
B	alright lads there's some nice bamboo for you
A	nice
B	bizarrely if you wanted to get a lot of
A	is it employ?
B	well yeah just get a load of beavers
A	get a load of beavers yeah
B	fence them in
A	mm
B	well give them something to you know
A	mm it seems fair
A	yeah
A	oh yeah
B	but they're they're non-human people
A	yeah
B	because they're not human but
A	no
B	they might be intelligent they may even be more intelligent
A	and yeah so don't keep them in tiny pools don't mistreat them and
B	Don't harm them and don't
A	don't
B	fine but I don't see why that is synonomous
A	you'd probably have the human right and not to be left out in the ocean you know? Cos that's not suitable for humans you know? Whereas actually
B	and if we treat them
A	so
B	so a dog
A	yeah
B	if they kill another dolphin or
A	yeah
B	so a dolphin
A	it doesn't really work
B	no it doesn't work at all I hadn't thought about it before
A	no
B	because dolphins are a dolphin is not very nice
A	well they're animals yeah that that's the point they they hunt
B	they're quite good as predators
A	mm
B	as are we
A	and they like play but you know
A	your favourite car
B	what?
A	that motorbike
B	it's not my favourite car don't you say that
A	oh I'm only joking
[ANNOTATION]	Person A  said he said a joke and he doesnt mean serious	Neutral
B	do you find that funny?
A	I just like teasing you
B	sorry?
A	it's just cos I don't like it very much
[ANNOTATION]	Person A said that he just joking and he doesnt mean to be serious	Entailment
B	ah
A	yeah
B	is this sixty? Oh
A	oh ho feel it on the legs
A	yeah that's the way to do it only ever come in at the top
B	that's hilarious
A	yeah well I was looking at the rain I was a bit like oh Sutton Bank and I thought oh there's no reason not to do it it's fine to drive
B	it's just I've never heard of
B	shit
A	I think cos we've
B	I've literally never heard of it
A	yeah it was quite erm I think maybe it's because I've been spending more time in North Yorkshire you've never really done North Yorkshire whereas we've driven around here a bit
[ANNOTATION]	Person A think that Person B have never been in North Yorkshire	Neutral
B	wow
A	nice isn't it?
B	it's a bit unnerving actually driving uphill
A	yeah?
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Person B think driving uphill is unnerving	Entailment
A	oh
B	because you could slip back quite easily
A	no
B	oh
A	okay?
B	yeah but
A	right at the top
B	well that was a a good experience because it went
[ANNOTATION]	Person B think it was a good experience	Entailment
A	yeah yeah
A	yeah
B	well if you can then er
A	yeah fair play to you
B	well I wouldn't want to try
A	mm not so much no
B	I really lost out on that
A	yeah
A	nice
B	actually I'm very glad you know after that time in
A	oh yes it was really struggling
A	yeah
B	and we'll get out and walk
A	yeah
B	see you at the top
A	erm so yeah so er when we get to the end of this road which is kind of
B	so gosh was that a single gradient mark or a double gradient mark on the map?
A	double
B	Good
A	okay so erm yeah so when we come to the end
B	so there's a turn off to the right
A	to the right for the B152
B	how far?
A	erm in about four miles
B	four miles okay
A	we must have a look at the erm the last bit of the
B	Don't miss the turning
A	okay
B	the perception is where you might be able to overtake to get into speed
A	yeah
B	look at that bit it is like a plateau
A	mm
B	it's like a
A	yeah
A	yeah yeah
B	it makes you think that it could be
A	yes
B	what's that steep bit called again?
A	Sutton Bank
A	okay
B	yeah
A	erm it could well be it
B	it's a minor road anyway
A	yeah
A	er yeah it is an actual B road
B	how can it be exclusive when it's run by monks?
A	er well as in you have to erm it's a kind of a Catholic thing and a lot of people go into the priesthood I think it's all quite erm
B	wow
A	but James Brody is quite unusual he's quite erm
B	unusual
A	do you know what I mean? He never  he never  seemed like you know you could imagine him not going to a normal school
B	no
A	yeah
A	picturesque
B	yeah
A	I guess the turn should be coming up pretty soon
B	picturesque
A	mm
B	it's not
A	oh right so I think it's where that
B	right
A	there isn't no
A	mm
A	yeah
B	this feels like there could be a town over by the next hill
A	mm
B	yeah exactly it's it's it's not bleak but it's still remote
A	yeah
B	wow
A	more than one actually
B	I certainly don't want to go to
A	sorry no we want the right hand one
B	yeah yeah I know
A	yeah
B	if you were keen and it was clear how quickly
A	mm
A	okay?
B	I still unfortunately
A	er yeah we're not going er towards them yeah
B	we're going towards?
A	we're going towards Morton yes that's that's correct yeah
A	yeah as far as one can tell these things
B	oh look at that
A	oh a little cottage
A	so we're gonna go through erm according to this two of the towns first and then we get to a town called
B	so we'll make a turn in a town?
A	yeah when we get into that town we take a turn onto a minor road which takes us down to Flaxton
B	I'm glad we're going this way rather than through York
A	mm it is
A	yeah presumably you haven't really driven around
B	no I've never been to Yorkshire
A	no other than when I dragged you to my convention
B	yes
A	I did appreciate it it
A	I didn't
A	mm
B	rather than recreating one page of a book about fifty times
A	yeah but there there were just loads of black sheets but there
B	essentially
A	some of them were but a lot of them were ideas sparked off by it
B	yeah
A	it was interesting
B	but I mean you can say about you know
A	yeah
B	do
A	erm artists I think they'd been involved with sort of
B	it would be hilarious
A	yeah
B	in one night?
A	or he he's sort of meant to be yeah
B	is that possible?
A	mm no
B	as in if you can't do it you'd be
A	so yeah we're sort of bearing left here
B	ooh Castle Howard
A	oh yeah so sad when I go to Castle Howard
B	why?
A	that's Brideshead
B	oh right
A	yeah it it's erm it's very close to here
B	well we could detour if you want?
A	not it's fine you need a a good while to appreciate its full glory
B	oh right
A	we should definitely have a trip though and then go to Castle Howard it's just amazing
A	yeah yeah that could be fun actually we'll drive up on Friday night and see
B	yeah
A	we'll got to Herriot World as well
B	I'm interested as to what that can be?
A	ah
B	is the chap
A	so it was probably the birthplace of Christopher Timothy then?
B	probably
A	yeah erm yeah we just stay on this road now
A	yeah
B	right
A	mm
B	new places
A	yeah it's cool
B	expanding my knowledge of the world
A	mm
A	yeah
A	and this makes you a bit blasé?
B	yeah you don't know but you don't appreciate particularly where you are
A	mm
B	because you're so busy
A	yeah
B	you don't about exploring the country really
A	yeah dear old Britain
B	even if we are stuck behind
A	no we're not doing bad
B	it's got to be nice actually
A	no
B	I take it this is one of the first of the er
A	erm I think
B	yeah
B	it's about
A	that's very helpful yes we are indeed in Stonegrave
B	okay so
A	so yeah so they basically erm we carry on erm to the next town and it's it's
B	sorry say that again?
A	okay so erm that that was one town and we'll go through the next town and then just at the end of it according to this erm we so once we've been through it
B	okay
A	erm there's a minor road turns off
B	is this
A	no
B	it's almost if the car has the best suspension so all considered
A	there's lots of halls and houses and things around here it's strange
B	that should be something hall or something house
A	yeah yeah sorry yeah
B	houses and we've got some church halls and lots of cottages
A	fair enough
A	yeah
B	yeah this is nice smooth road
A	it's a funny name for a place
A	yeah it is it's funny
A	nice isn't it? It's all very smart
A	oh very nice
B	yeah
A	there's a bakery
A	it's all about zeros
B	it's not
A	no it is
B	it's not
A	yeah which is giving her something
B	she didn't do any work
A	and she doesn't particularly like
B	it's about like me giving up using a vibrator
A	okay so according to this it'll be the next right hand bend these are just that's just a drive drive
B	right here?
A	yes it's this this one here yes
B	that was a turn and a half
A	okay and now we carry on down to Sherrif Hutton erm which I reckon is six miles
B	oh right so we're now on the actual?
A	this is the minor road that takes us down to Flaxton
B	okay
A	yeah
A	this is Potticar Bank which seems to fit with the er
B	yeah it's topology yes
A	yeah
A	mm
A	yeah
B	Jesus it's bumpy
A	mm
B	we might have a Jaguar
A	I was just about to say about the Jag
B	not really
A	no I mean the
B	oh right yes the car is however particularly
B	right so how far is down here?
A	how far?
B	Down here is it?
A	erm so erm so from where we turned off
B	yeah
A	erm we go kind of just three miles so we're not too far off
B	three miles?
A	erm well so then the road erm it kind of veers around to the left and then we wanna take a right turn and carry on towards Sherrif Hutton so it'll it'll be signposted
B	and presumably you'll tell me where that turning is?
A	yeah
B	I don't think that the next road we're taking
A	yeah
B	so that's Wilkinson's law of overtaking
B	ooh smoking
A	hmm
B	it smells good
A	mm
A	yeah
B	right
A	depending on what
B	less than a mile?
A	yeah
B	okay that's original
A	yeah so either this road is gonna veer around to the left or there's gonna be a T-junction where we wanna go left
B	and a more powerful car
A	mm
B	and if he wasn't sort of over the line
A	yeah
B	oh dear
A	oh right so this is probably the yeah
B	right
