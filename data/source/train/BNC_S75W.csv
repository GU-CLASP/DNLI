B	I can't even remember it myself now
C	I can't remember what happened yesterday
A	what I can remember is you all had chickenpox I think
B	oh yeah
A	yeah and I was knocking on the door and then yeah I know
B	oh
A	so it was after that obviously
B	mm
A	erm but yeah it'll be like thirteen years ago

C	no
C	no
A	god loads of changes I remember you had er
C	mm I was happy in there as well I suppose I've never not been happy there's nothing to not be happy about really
C	well there isn't is there?
B	no you're a happy person
C	yeah
A	yeah so how did you actually get into
C	erm it was an apprenticeship
A	but how did you find it I mean it's
A	oh right
C	I
A	yeah
C	through it's on their website and I remember I was in my auntie's having a barbecue and my phone rang and it was the Chamber saying are you okay to do a telephone interview?
A	which is nice
C	I'd never had an interview and I was like yeah okay so I went in the I went out in the front and I had an
A	oh goodness that's

A	well if you want to go to Hawaii
C	mm
A	oh well
B	oh
A	the the you know the massive
C	oh
A	massive new port for huge ships and I can remember in the eighties that was one of those things they said well Liverpool never got the big port because they never dredged it and so everything went down south
B	yeah
C	they're even putting that awful HS two down there
A	well
B	I don't agree with that
A	no well it's they can have it the thing is if you look now even now everything that seems to be regular connections it's just bypassing Liverpool
B	mm
A	you know if you want to go anywhere you have to go to really northwest and and it's like why would you want to go
B	mm
C	I know
A	erm cos it's like oh yeah straight line Manchester and yeah sorry you're too far to the rest and it's like you wouldn't have any other country where you have a major city and it's it's you know on some sidings
C	yeah
A	with awful little trains that were built in the nineteen sixties
B	there's not is there?
C	mm I suppose I bet you the council's got that if it's not broke don't fix it
B	yeah
C	isn't it?
[ANNOTATION]	The trains were great in the nineteen sixties.	Contradiction
A	well it's nothing to do with the council really but it's that's the thing it's it

A	yeah it's like
C	oh
A	so
B	they'll maybe move out
C	no
A	no I don't know what it is because you know unless unless he he suddenly won the lottery or something I can't I've no idea
C	yeah gosh you wouldn't live around here if you won the lottery
A	well this is why he was just singing and he has been all

C	mm yeah we had a barbeque and we could hear him singing couldn't we?
B	yeah yeah
C	we just thought he was happy
A	yeah well that's that's what I mean but he's been happy for a rather long time ie most of this afternoon
[ANNOTATION]	That the other person was happy.	Neutral
C	ah
A	and but I've never heard him singing before which is good
C	mm
B	yeah you'd rather have him singing than shouting wouldn't you?
A	yeah yeah but it's it's one of those
B	mm you know
A	ah yeah I saw them being picked up all the boys which was
[ANNOTATION]	The person doesn't sing good.	Neutral

B	oh
C	it sounds dead good
C	I know it'll be nice that
A	I met your colleagues because obviously sitting amongst loads of people during your birthday
B	oh
A	and I said so how do you know
B	ah do we know them?
A	yeah what did you say you're doing three different jobs?
B	yeah
A	so what what is it? is it one for Monday and one for Tuesday Wednesday off?
A	I'll just let
A	hey
C	I downloaded it
B	oh he's trying to do Mymaths and he can't get on the laptop can he?
C	no Flash player
B	but have you been on it? yeah and does it
C	leave it on that page and I'll sort it out when I go in
B	so have you done some of it no? you couldn't get on at all?
C	no you can't
B	go on then
C	I'll do it from here because we can get wi-fi from here can't we?
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	because that's what I'm using
B	yeah so on the Monday Tuesday and Thursday I work for father
A	yeah
B	so I'll sort of like change the beds do his washing do his ironing load the dishwasher
A	yeah
B	do the housework open the door see to some people if they come in and then at half eleven I finish there and then I do the school job then the dinner lady so a supervisor's assistant and then on a Wednesday and a Friday I work in a furniture shop for
C	and then she comes back and does it all at home for us
B	yeah
A	yeah you can see all your fingers are roved to the bone
B	I know but then someone was saying that they're gonna let me know if Tesco are taking on
C	oh yeah well you get discount there as well
B	so I might do Tesco
A	yeah
B	mm
C	I don't like Tesco
A	do you not?
B	it's too expensive
C	it's too big
A	yeah
C	it wants to take over and it's just not happening
A	yeah that's why all the other shops went because of Tesco
C	yeah
A	yeah they're more or less the moment
C	I'm quite curious to know how much that Tesco
A	yeah because I think they
C	because
A	they built it and then
C	it's too big
A	yeah and then they realised that actually people don't shop that much
A	yeah
C	and it's still alright
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	however I'd like to know that
A	I mean and you can see the car park it's it's never full
B	no
C	no
A	given that they have things
C	and the car park clearing service too
B	did you see the erm car boot sale today?
A	no
C	you know the old fire station?
A	yeah
B	inside the car park every Tuesday is erm like a car boot sale
A	oh right
C	half nine until or nine or half nine until two and it was absolutely chocka and they had a climb up
A	you couldn't miss it now
B	and it's something to do with Excel er I think they've rented the ground off
A	well they used to have like a little market didn't they on the the waste ground next to the fire station which was like a bit of a car park
C	where the Mecca was
B	yeah that was years ago
A	yeah
B	mm yeah so
C	yeah
A	yeah just imagine they would have had the fire station as well
B	I know
A	it would have been even larger
B	yeah
A	well they closed loads of shops didn't they and they realised they're not making any money
B	mm
A	and I think
C	oh
A	and I don't know they must have found somebody else to do that but they didn't they just realised it cannot make the money well it's slightly obvious isn't it? if you haven't got money you can't spend it so
B	no he's trying to do your maths aren't you? because he's got a letter from school so he's got to study a bit more now
A	oh how come?
B	we couldn't get there all the time you've got to be there three times a week
A	and just a heavy load?
B	erm yeah
C	too much
B	yeah and and I won't drive there cos I don't like driving far erm and basically he was he was
A	yeah
B	you have to leave here at quarter to five to get through to the peak hour in town through the tunnel and then you're not back until about ten o'clock of a night that's a long time
A	so the the erm
B	no no
C	he was there for fifteen weeks
B	you know what they said? he wasn't fast enough after fifteen weeks
C	they could have found that out on the first go
B	I just think they're excuses myself
C	mm
B	and you feel like saying to them don't you all if he's not fast enough how come you've not trained him in the fifteen weeks then?
A	yeah
C	mm
B	it's true isn't it?
C	surely you can train them to be fast enough?
B	and he comes out what did you come in school in your athletics?
unknown_female	don't know
B	when you were with
A	yeah yeah
B	and erm
A	is it not happening?
C	I just I got my laptop for Christmas but I
A	reboot
C	I don't really use it do I? I've got a tablet and my phone aha good old E Internet Explorer that's what I need
A	nobody uses Explorer any more do they?
C	I know
A	the world has gone too fast for it
C	but I've already got what I'm looking for but I've gotta filter on here they think that's stopping it
A	you should be able to say Adobe you can always override something
C	it's like oh I
A	yeah because everything that used to be something else is now called an application
C	it's just annoying oh
B	you've come out
C	how do you spell that?
A	it's easy
C	I need your password
A	you could type it in
C	oh this might take a while is your phone charging?
A	no
A	it needs charging overnight that's what it is
B	you should put it on your phone
C	well I'm trying to make it work aren't I? that's lazy you might as well shout
B	no wonder they didn't get in
C	he's not fast enough
B	yeah he's not fast enough
C	I can hear him moving
B	I know he's loud isn't he?
C	can you?
B	yeah
C	I'm getting somewhere now can you remember that
A	Flash player should be straightforward
C	mm
A	try a different browser
C	mm
A	that's what I do
C	what browser were you using before
A	ask him to say to text you
C	hurry up
B	so when you met er my colleagues in work was it
A	there were three or four of them yeah they were all sitting there I can't remember their names now erm they definitely got the photos before us
B	yeah
A	yeah yeah I've got my picture to treasure
C	have you remembered it? yeah
B	ah
C	so what is it
A	just pass her the text
C	yeah
B	I know
C	go on
B	this is a normal day in our house
C	five one six seven Y it says invalid username and password combination you've put it totally wrong that's
A	five year
B	yeah
C	I did but when you press enter it goes again oh yeah
B	mm
A	it zooms off
C	ah that was it
B	guess where
A	I was there well I wasn't there but I heard yeah and then it was
C	I know
A	yeah close enough
C	done it? what was wrong? so you've done it? Flash not enabled but I have got it though I hate technology why can't they just make you write down the whole
B	they they mark it and
C	yeah but they don't mark it the thing does the teacher doesn't mark it easy life
B	mm
C	they're on holiday now their six weeks holiday and they should be sweating marking all this paperwork
A	as I said try a different browser if it isn't IE now try it'll just be the Firefox
C	well it's it's sent Flash player is with Internet Explorer you do not need to install Flash player either Flash player is disabled or Activex filter is on
A	yeah
C	you should be good at laptops you're younger than me
C	no
B	no no
A	it's just not working the computer says no the computer says no I'm not gonna do this
B	mm
C	have you tried it on the other laptop? did they work on that? that's bad
A	because they haven't got Flash
B	I know
C	I don't know
A	it probably only needs Flash for animations that are not even part of it
C	ridiculous that's got nothing to do with the homework again magical dragon or something and you get good marks
A	it's good for eight year olds
B	yeah
A	you're sure you're doing the right er maths class?
C	I'm just going around in circles this is just ridiculous
B	do you wanna ask
B	I don't know
C	no not now mum it's not the right time
B	mm
C	it might be my security on the laptop
B	well you don't know
C	you can
B	excuses excuses
A	yeah ironic if you think it's meant to be a productivity tool and the amount of time
B	yeah
A	in the end I just gave up on Windows just it's because it was things like that
C	you've got Apple things
A	Apple doesn't like Flash either and they say well
C	I don't have Apple
A	they say that Flash is blah
B	mm
C	I know can you not just a detention
B	no but he's got to practise for it though
C	well what do you need to practise just go on Youtube? well what what are you learning?
B	mm
C	there's gotta be some things you're not good at
A	yeah there might be something on the net that doesn't need Flash
C	yeah the proper internet
A	the proper internet rather than the proper
C	rather than this awful Flash internet
B	mm
C	I don't
B	no he said it was working
C	well er the page loaded to log in but when I said doing my homework it doesn't you should
A	you can always switch it off and try again in an hour it magically seems to work
B	yeah
B	when do you go back
A	eighteenth
B	of August?
A	yeah so it's it's the last couple of weeks now it's it's shocking isn't it? it's like oh my gosh
B	I know
A	all the money is spent I'm gonna have somebody coming on Thursday or Friday to do the gutter
C	oh
A	two hundred and sixty quid and that's just because of these cowboys who did it the last time
C	mm
A	and it's like well it needs doing and now it's at least it's a professional
B	is it leaking?
A	yeah it's remember last year I asked
B	oh yeah
C	oh yeah
A	and erm he put some bitumen or something in it but because it's so badly done it's started leaking again and it's right right in the centre so it goes straight into the brickwork
B	oh
C	uh
A	so it needs doing
B	mm
A	and er so yeah
B	that's awful
A	just just come and he said no I have to give you a an estimate first
B	mm
A	he's doing the pointing as well so the good thing is I've got somebody moving in
C	oh have you?
A	so basically the first two months' rent that's already
C	oh
A	gone that's er she is the one who didn't come last year so touch wood she's not
B	mm
A	but er she was telling me that there were there were some external reasons so nothing to do with me or the house
B	oh
A	last time so hopefully that's not happening again
B	is she a student or?
A	no she works in the
C	oh
A	and the fire officer
B	in the
B	yeah the little
A	the irony will be that hm?
B	oh

C	oh
B	so she's a fire officer did you say?
A	fire officer and front of house
B	oh

B	mm
A	and I've known her for phew donkey's because we used to work in the
C	oh yeah
A	erm so she's gonna come well I suppose on on that day I'll be
B	how long is she staying for?
A	well it'll be the year
B	mm
A	at least er as I said

B	yeah well
C	D
B	yeah

C	well I'm not that good at computers I don't know what bit it is
B	which bit?
C	exactly
A	er it's either thirty-two or sixty-four if it's new it should be sixty-four
C	even I still it's it's bizarre I don't get them computers
B	which?
C	one of them Apple computer thingies
B	is it good
A	I've got only Apple and nothing but because as I said I had my last Windows needed an update and then the update didn't load and it got stuck in the middle and nothing worked and it was like and then I
B	mm
A	just decided it took me three months to get used to use the Apple system because it's different
B	oh is it?
A	erm they're getting closer and closer because Windows copies more and more but erm so I use Windows at work because obviously all the machines are like that
B	mm
A	and then that's just Apple
B	oh it's like still a computer Apple isn't it?
C	mm
C	but it's Apple
