A	well we could get one twelve and one nine
D	yeah if you want
A	I can't believe it's this complicated
B	I don't mind what I don't even know what we were talking about between if I'm being honest
B	I don't know what the options are
[ANNOTATION]	person B is not sure about options are	Neutral
B	are we getting are we just gonna get the free garlic bread
A	yeah
B	with it? whatever pizzas we get
D	is that what we want to do?
A	yeah I think so
D	cos we don't get cheese with that one
B	it's it's not cheesy garlic bread
A	mm do you want
B	well we could get
[ANNOTATION]	they are not sure about cheesy garlic	Neutral
D	shall shall we just go for the meal deal one?
B	okay
D	which is thirteen fifty
A	yeah alright okay
B	I think
A	yeah
B	that's like three pizzas then with the garlic bread it's like
[ANNOTATION]	they are not sure about price of food	Neutral
D	yeah so
B	two pizzas
A	yeah
D	yeah yeah
B	and a garlic bread and chips
D	yeah yeah
B	so I think that'll be alright
A	thirteen fifty
D	do that can we put cheese on the chips?

D	I've got cheese as well do you want?
A	er that's four fifty each

A	chicken and sweetcorn and the
D	Caribbean barbeque or something? yeah Caribbean barbeque twist I'm just saying though that's only one fifty each difference between the five inch pizzas
A	is it?
D	yeah well cos if it's eighteen pound between three of us that makes it six
A	yeah six minus four fifty is only one fifty
D	yeah
A	oh I don't know
D	and you get a bigger garlic bread
A	oh god

C	I don't even know if I've done it right though
A	this one's mouldy as well
B	it's mouldy?
A	yeah
B	no
D	I just don't know how to draw erm diagrams I think I've done everything else
C	yeah
D	it's the
C	basically C you have to do to draw B so C we think is just the calculation you do so that you can draw B
D	but I just need to see like
D	what you've done cos I have no idea where to start with it so
B	what?
D	erm
unknown_female	mm
D	yeah and I need to split my code
C	oh
D	and do my reading file I still don't know what I'm gonna write in the report either
B	I think you should start recording
A	it is recording
B	I was just
C	not have you started writing it?
D	yeah I've done
unknown_female	oh good
D	I've done my introduction and my code design and I've made a film and I've done all my
C	that's the bit that takes ages
D	it's just
C	okay
D	I analysed the energy and the frame period and
C	from well I realise now that there's like an equation but I did it from the energy cos from the my energy oscillation is really weird cos there's only three bodies
D	okay
C	so but that's got a period like the oscillation
unknown_female	mm
D	okay cos my period oscillation varies depending on what my size of delta T is and how often I print data
C	yeah okay
D	yeah
C	oh yeah I don't know yeah
D	yeah I was gonna do energy and how how that changes with respect to
C	oh
D	delta two
unknown_female	yeah
B	that one I think it might
A	well I'm doing this like reading challenge I've set myself a reading challenge I found one online and one of them is

D	mm
C	that's backwards that though
A	I mean if someone was like
B	yeah that is backwards
C	I can deal with stuff on the screen but if it's like a pair of lungs in front of me in real life I will run away
A	well I mean yeah if there was like someone and like
B	when have you ever seen a pair of lungs?
C	in biology in biology
B	yeah I had to do that

B	it was literally it was this big
D	chicken hearts would be tiny
B	and I got it out no it wasn't it was erm pig hearts
D	I was gonna say cos I think these were
B	which are this big
D	lamb ones or something
B	my ox heart was this big
D	yeah but it's easier to see everything
B	yeah it was great
B	except no there was a guy there was a guy that was really weird and he like sat near me in biology and he came up and he was stroking it and he was like you're okay now it's like
B	if anyone's gonna be a serial killer it's gonna be him
A	that's creepy
D	creepy
C	so creepy
B	so creepy

C	yeah
A	like that sardine
D	oh I don't know maybe you can get different sized sardines
B	no yeah they are chopped up in tins
C	I think I'm thinking of anchovies which are like
D	anchovies are little
C	they're little
D	I don't like either though so er just the thought of eating sardines with all the bones
A	oh
D	like it's when the people like but no they're just small and they just crunch it's like oh
B	oh no no
B	we used to give them like put sardines in my dog's breakfast like make his joints better cos he had arthritis
A	ah
B	I didn't realise people ate them
B	I thought it was just pets
A	just for dogs
B	I thought they were just for pet food
B	I didn't realise people ate them I was like that's grim
D	my mum went to the fishmonger's once and er cos we were having a barbeque and she wanted to buy some fish and she was like oh yeah we want some without bones and get came back they were the boniest things ever I think they were literally like
B	oh
D	I don't even know

A	are you thinking of Scrat from Ice Age?
B	no sprat is like a
A	oh
B	I don't know it's a character in a film I think
A	I don't know if it was a fish
D	maybe not but erm and they yeah and they were full of those I can't oh yeah but with when we were dissecting
D	the sardine erm you could like it was you could like dissect the eye and
unknown	oh
D	found the little lens and it's really weird
A	oh
B	oh gross
D	no it wasn't that bad
B	that's interesting though
D	yeah
C	yeah I
D	I didn't like biology though
A	it's just
D	it's just so boring
D	oh sorry
A	and now
B	oh it's from Downton Abbey
A	oh
D	my cousin's friend's brother got a needle stuck in his eye
A	oh
D	oh god
A	oh
D	it was like my
B	I was gonna say it doesn't sound funny
unknown_female	it's hilarious
B	at all
D	my grandma er has like really bad vision and so she has to have injections in her eyes which sounds disgusting but every time my mum like it's mentioned round my mum my mum just goes
A	mm I hate eyes
D	yeah
A	anything
D	yeah
A	to do with eyes I
B	I can touch my eye with my finger
D	that's not good you shouldn't
B	why? yeah but
A	put germs in it
B	I don't do it but I can
A	yeah
D	I can but only cos I learnt to put contacts in
C	well like if I've got an eyelash in my eye I'll
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	but only if absolutely necessary
B	I need to get contact lenses
A	you need to
B	I maybe just
D	are contact lenses made of plastic now?
C	yeah they're like
D	what were they used be made out of?
C	cellophane like glass used to be made out of the glass but the yeah like
A	is that what they made lenses out of?
C	plasticy sillicony stuff
B	my god that is gross
A	yeah
B	how long were
C	oh ages
B	I was gonna say since like nineteen eighty or something
D	probably longer
C	I think so yeah
B	yeah yeah that's fine
D	like you'll never have had glass ones
B	I was like meant now like they've recently just got changed from glass
D	oh no
B	I was like
D	no no
B	oh
A	do you have contact lenses?
B	into your eye though? what?
A	do you
B	no
A	oh
C	she just can't see
B	I need to get them
B	I wear glasses
A	er yeah I knew you I knew you
B	but I need to go and get contacts
C	and then you can see all the time
B	yeah yeah that's that's the one
D	I think like it's less effort to just wear glasses I need to go and get my eyes tested actually
B	no it's not it's not less effort to wear glasses cos glasses
C	if you if you just like put your contacts in in the morning they're just like
B	my glasses
C	that'll be all day
B	I've worn my glasses for a long time like they made my nose feel funny
C	are they too heavy? you need to get lighter glasses
B	I don't know but they like they sit here and then sometimes I'm like it just makes it feel funny I don't like it
C	yeah they're just too heavy and they like mark your nose
B	yeah yeah they do
C	yeah
B	that
D	they do it just to here or is it just here?
B	they don't dig in they just
C	get some like
B	they don't dig in you
A	yeah I know
A	you should get one of those chains that like like grannies wear
B	yeah
B	oh yeah
B	my mum has like trifocal glasses so she can like just see everything she needs them for everything and she never wears them she can't read things close she can't see things far away and she can't see things normally she just
B	well she doesn't
C	she just can't see anything ever
B	but she doesn't wear her glasses and I've like why?
D	my mum has
D	varifocals now and she doesn't like them cos she she was
A	yeah
D	like cos my mum's eyes are really bad
A	oh on like I thought you meant like on a like an Ipad
D	what what what does that say
B	oh
D	on my tablet?
B	no yeah I did that but that's cos we were
A	yeah
B	talking about it earlier
D	no
B	about tablets
D	er pills
A	yeah
C	yeah
D	erm and like she sometimes it makes her feel dizzy cos she moves her eyes instead of her head cos it depends on which bit of the glasses you look through as to what
C	okay yeah
D	the strength is
A	yeah
D	it's like to do this was like look from your face to your feet she'd have to move her head rather than her eyes and it makes her dizzy
A	yeah
D	sometimes so she wants to get some single vision ones
A	yeah my mum doesn't like her bifocals
D	mm
D	I dunno I just really don't want glasses
B	do you need them?
C	embrace the glasses
D	I don't think so I need to go and get my eyes tested though just to check
B	I was like I don't want glasses but then were like just makes life easier but I wore contacts
D	well if you can't see obviously
A	mm
B	yeah but erm I want contacts cos I don't like wearing them all the time
A	mm
B	for long periods of time so
D	I'm so hungry
A	I know
B	I know I'm hungry now
A	I'm so disappointed about the cake oh my god
D	and
A	yeah
D	oh
A	they were both mouldy
C	why are there mouldy cakes? did you leave them here?
A	yeah I got them
C	oh
B	we called them
C	well what was the date on them?
B	like
A	November
B	twenty minutes ago
C	oh oh so they're like halfway there
B	unless
D	what he said was half an hour forty to fifty minutes
A	that's quite a wide
C	so he started optimistic and then he was like wait no
D	to be fair we do that in the pharmacy it's like we'll be like oh yeah it'll probably be a little while it'll be like mm
C	but we had a long day
D	what yeah I've been up since eight
C	oh my god eight
A	same
D	yeah I've done an hour and a quarter of exercise thank you very much
C	yeah
C	I've been sewing today
D	I've been injured
B	sewing?
C	I've done like an hour of exercise
A	sewing
A	oh which is
A	I don't think that
B	that's not really exercise
B	with your fingers
D	I'm planning on like start starting going swimming again more often
A	right
D	cos I've only used my gym membership four times
B	I wanna go to do play badminton
A	yeah
D	we should go yeah
A	let's play badminton
D	yeah
C	what's that?
A	er badminton
C	yeah it's
B	I might pop into
D	that's like yeah if I actually try and start using the gym membership cos
B	yeah
A	well since you're paying like
D	yeah
C	but it was quite good today I thought it was gonna be like four quid or something cos it was but I don't know when the peak times are but it was only two fifty-five so for some reason it wasn't
D	maybe that's cos it's holidays still
C	but
B	but but I was gonna say
C	maybe
B	maybe it's cos term's not started
D	it's not term time
C	yeah
D	but that's weird cos normally the whole of weekend is peak
C	yeah well that's what I thought I was sure it was gonna be really expensive
B	which probably cos it's out of term time

D	yeah I like I was having these revelations I only realised like two weeks ago that I'd left my eggs
B	yeah
D	melon on the side which I really need to empty cos it's disgusting and then like two weeks
B	oh yeah

B	oh
D	cos it's like if you

C	where are you gonna part your hair though?
D	side
C	oh side like oh yeah cos then you'll just get a
