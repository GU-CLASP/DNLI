B	mm
C	I don't really wanna go into Essex

B	okay
C	to continue to the Dartford Tunnel
B	yeah
C	but that entrance was blocked off as well by like police vehicles
B	really?
C	slip road
B	that is a really good tip

C	okay
B	and so that can be on the table
C	who is he?
B	er off the table
C	from POF?
B	has er popped up
C	yeah
B	but it's very it's always been very casual
C	okay
B	so weird
C	okay
B	he's got ADHD
C	post
B	yeah
C	okay
B	no
C	right
B	whereas with him if you just asked him a question it was he was very up front about stuff
C	okay
B	rat basically
C	yep
B	um so he can charge quite a lot of money
C	oh okay
B	but he's also a screenwriter
C	ah
B	he also works for the
C	oh
B	so he's quite an interesting character
C	yes
B	like all this stuff comes
C	yeah
B	out
C	yeah
B	that you would never expect
C	okay
B	you know I just thought well he's obviously really interested in like current affairs and politics
C	yeah
B	all the stuff that you would never imagine
C	yeah
B	and he's got ADHD
C	so does he live by himself now then?
B	lives by himself
C	hello
B	but the guy's never there
C	okay
B	Cos he's got a girlfriend
C	okay
B	but he basically does live there
C	oh
B	walkable
C	okay
B	so um yeah
C	is ADHD just sort of like too much energy?
B	yeah
C	right
B	told me this quite hilarious story where he tried to make hot cross buns
C	yeah
B	eight times
C	right
B	and then burn them
C	okay
B	after the first time you would pay attention
C	yeah
B	no
C	okay
B	until he actually sat there and watched it
C	oh
B	just keep swimming
C	yeah yeah yeah
B	but then he's been round the house a few times which is why obviously
C	yeah
B	and I didn't hear from him
C	yeah
B	that was at six
C	oh no
B	no word
C	huh
B	so um I sent a message saying well I'm gonna eat dinner now cos I'm really hungry

C	oh my God
B	I know
C	yeah
B	wonder what's happened to you
C	regarding?
B	he'd stayed over on the Wednesday night
C	oh
B	so that kept me awake all night
C	yeah
B	and then in the morning when he finally had got to sleep I had to get up
C	why did he say that?
B	was rude
C	Cos he was just like wanting to sleep?
B	well he told me later that it was because he was er he'd forgotten his inhaler
C	yeah
B	then we said we'd see each other on last Sunday
C	last week er last weekend?
B	mm

C	yeah yeah yeah
B	um
C	wait is all of this true?

C	do you know it's all true?
B	er certificate

C	like a plan
B	that's brilliant
C	is he good-looking?
B	I think he's really cute
C	is he tall?
B	no
C	ah
B	shorter than me
C	right it's going nowhere
C	POF profile you need to

C	what's she doing there?
B	she's gonna go for a year
C	wait when?
B	this was all my plan
C	she's nicked your plan?

C	what about her?
B	she's had a um a total nightmare living with her mum

B	she's mean
C	yeah yeah
B	it makes me really appreciate that when I was at home
C	yeah
B	mum never gave me grief really
C	no
B	yeah
C	yeah well she er well er poison pie
B	poison pie
C	but pie nonetheless
B	mm
C	and she does it for me every night
B	oh
B	and she wallpapered the Toblerone room
C	she wallpapered the Toblerone room
B	mm
B	all er she's made you
C	okay
B	verging on alcoholism
C	okay
B	came home absolutely smashed and er
C	oh my God
B	um
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	she just says she gets total grief
C	so er she's given up her sort of teaching the children job?
B	well the thing is all of her contracts have always been for one year
C	okay
B	but this one has been maternity cover
C	right
B	the next half-term
B	so she's only got seven weeks left
C	so and then she's booked to go to Australia for one year?
B	er well no she's booked for like
C	one way flight?
B	no
C	er
B	the immigration prefer it if you do
C	okay
B	and you can change it
C	oh okay
B	so she's flying with Qantas
C	where's she going?
B	subcontract
C	Sydney? Melbourne?
B	Brisbane of all places
C	okay
B	she said she went to er STA travel and they talked her into it
C	Good luck with that
B	but
C	and isn't she going in like their winter as well?
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	so even if she went later in the year she would've had to get a part-time job for the summer
C	yep
B	so you might as well just go
C	okay
B	so that's what's her thinking between behind Brisbane was it was north so it's warmer
C	is she going on her own?
B	yeah
B	Don't have any money
C	do you not have any money?
B	no
C	yay
B	car booty
C	you could probably make about twenty pounds
C	really?
B	I'd spend more money than I actually made
C	you're like
B	mm
C	and um mum was supposed to be doing it with
B	mm
C	and then er she said to
B	oh God
C	got in at half past five
C	mum goes up to his room at seven o'clock and all I hear is shut the fuck up
B	Jesus
C	I know
B	he was still pissed
C	and so mum was like er I knew that she'd be really disappointed
B	mm
C	so I was like fuck's sake
B	oh
C	get out of bed at like
B	so you did it
C	seven thirty
B	oh
C	and I go through to the bathroom
B	oh
C	and I was like um go back to bed
B	oh
C	I get dressed like dead quick
C	but at this stage in the game I was like well I'm dressed and ready now
B	mm
C	so I followed them in my little smart car
B	oh okay
C	and then at nine o'clock they let you in to get to your pitch
B	oh
C	sets up at the same time
B	oh I see
C	yeah you can't
B	you can't just set up
C	no
B	oh my God
C	anyway so mum had a right mixture of stuff
C	which she let go for two pounds
B	oh no
C	now if we'd done our research on eBay
B	yeah
C	we would've known
B	mm
C	they go for anywhere between sort of twelve and thirty
B	mm
C	and er as
C	it's gone now
B	aw
C	but then she did sell a keyboard for thirty-five
C	that he painted me for like some
B	oh
C	anniversary that is shit and rank
C	amateurish and retarded
C	she kept it in the loft
C	for over ten years
C	she always thought it was he was gonna like make it
B	aw
C	and um anyway
B	mm
C	and he was saying someone said to me that you can't take anything to a boot sale um if you would be upset that it got nicked
B	yeah
C	and he told me a really funny story
C	then she goes will you take forty-seven P? Right?
B	no way
C	and he was like I would love to but I just can't get let it go for less than fifty P
B	for three P?
C	yeah
B	Jesus Christ
C	yeah
B	is it really that bad?
C	yeah
B	fuck me
C	and I'd heard about dodgy twenty pound notes
B	mm
C	so when we had like a rail of some clothes
B	mm
C	like old boys' clothes
B	huh? The gypo again
C	and um she picked up three shirts
B	mm
C	she handed me a twenty pound note
B	oh
C	and I held it up and looked at it
B	on the ball
C	on the button with it all
B	yeah
C	she left it all and everything
B	suspicious
C	but cos everything was just pound and fifty Ps apart from the keyboard and the pictures
B	mm
C	I think that was okay
B	oh have you? That's a good idea
C	yeah
C	I haven't made any money on it
B	mm
C	I've let go for ninety-nine P
B	nice
C	so like three pound a dress
B	mm
C	right? And it was nine ninety-nine
B	yeah
B	no way
C	so I was like I'll have a piece of this
B	yeah
C	anyway so I wore it that er Saturday night
B	mm
C	but it was very low-cut at the front
B	mm
C	and I don't er
B	no
C	so I kind of like I
B	mm
C	so I put it on eBay
B	yeah
C	I'm not gonna do stupid crazy sixty-five pounds
B	has that woman got any bids on hers?
C	no
B	oh
C	but she's relisted it  relisted it  for sixty-eight
B	oh
C	but I put mine on at eighteen pound auction
B	oh okay
C	so hopefully it might go
B	mm
C	and I can make a cheeky eight pound profit
B	oh well that'd be nice
C	so my new thing is going to like there's one charity shop in town that doesn't take Primark or New Look shit
B	Good stuff
C	quality stuff
B	nice
C	Juliet? oh my God
B	oh and
C	Juliet
B	mm
C	she's just popped on with William to do something
B	mm
C	all good condition and everything
B	huh
C	because she's got the eye now for
B	yeah
C	her range is little kiddy stuff
B	mm
C	so she knows the value of everything
B	mm
C	so she literally
B	she knows her market
C	flipped it within ten minutes and made twenty pounds
B	nice
C	it was so funny
B	sort of Wendy houses and stuff?
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	little Cozy Coupe cars and she's got a er industrial unit and she's got it all in there
B	oh my God
C	so people
B	so she's doing really well then
C	come along and they're like oh yeah I've come to pick up this slide
B	mm
C	and then she's got all this other shit there
B	oh God
C	for like yeah so she's doing good on that
B	mm
C	she's doing well on that
B	that's quite exciting
C	well
B	buying and selling
C	he just buys
B	mister Trebus
C	he is Mister Trebus
B	er but he was doing that wasn't he? He was making quite a nice little profit before
B	mm
C	he's got more of an incentive to make cos he's doing cold calling basically
B	mm
C	and they were like that
B	yeah
C	but they're like in this current job climate blah blah
B	it's showing initiative isn't it
C	I know
C	I was like that
B	but I've got cancer
C	let's all move to bloody
C	Barbados
B	oh huh
C	isn't it a bit mad to go with no nothing lined up or not?
B	my concern er obviously cos she's got on her skills list you know that they allow you in more readily
C	yeah
B	if you've got a skill that they're looking for
C	has she got any of the skills?
B	teaching is
C	oh is it?
C	oh that's interesting
B	on the skills list
C	I suppose it's primary school
B	really know
C	it's a bit more
B	well they um
C	flexible
B	with her visa they said are you gonna be teaching for longer than three months? And if so give us all your health records
C	yeah
B	what your outgoings
C	yeah
B	Brisbane
C	okay
B	east coast
C	yeah
B	you can go to like the er northern territories and that's but that's really like real yokel
C	okay
B	area
C	yeah
B	it's a bit scary rah
C	okay
B	and I guess that's probably
C	yeah
B	and then fly from there to huh New Zealand
C	or just go on a tour
B	for a few weeks or something
C	yeah
B	well that's what
C	yes
B	so
C	yeah
B	didn't she get like
C	yeah
B	have you not spoken to her since we?
C	no she sent me a really narky um thing
B	the last time I spoke to you about it was in
C	yeah
B	then she was being a bit off with you
C	yeah
B	there was that e-mail
C	I was like fine I'll leave it
B	yeah
C	fair enough
B	mm
C	I'm moving to
B	from

B	mm
C	and just got a text message back going this isn't my address anymore
B	mm
C	she wrote back and she went okay well enjoy your Sunday
B	she didn't give you her address?
C	yeah yeah yeah
B	yeah
C	and er she and she wouldn't give me her address
B	why would she go to the effort of writing to you and say this isn't my address?
C	yeah
B	because she clearly got the card
C	yeah
B	because she wouldn't know that you'd sent it
C	I know
B	mm
C	I think er I just don't think we have that much in common anymore
B	mm well no
C	yeah
B	haven't you
C	yeah
B	but that doesn't mean that you know if a few years time you might've come
C	yeah
B	and maybe you'll come back like that
C	who knows
B	but it's a bit of a shame that she's acted like that
C	yeah
B	huh
C	I mean to be honest probably objectively speaking she's not done anything wrong
B	well the last thing you need at the moment is any more drama
B	hard work so
C	yeah
B	A
C	yeah
B	was it
C	it was
B	yeah
C	and then um but because of this drama that happened previous
B	what?
C	I was
B	oh
C	distracted by that
B	right
C	so when I got there I just had a couple of drinks
B	so why
C	no one lives in
B	oh it was in a bar was it?
C	yeah but it was um
C	Cos everyone either lives in like
B	oh yeah
B	doesn't a lot of them live in
C	that kind of stuff
C	and I was like that
B	mm
C	um so I just went along
B	mm
C	and er three halves later
B	that I was gonna say that's for you going wild
C	yeah
C	if I'd been there any longer
B	mm
C	then at half eleven I was like I have to leave now
B	mm

C	that's nice
B	so yeah
B	what we should've done is actually gone Thursday night
C	part of the group
B	for eighteen pound
C	oh
B	so actually
B	if we'd stayed the Thursday night we wouldn't have to rush
C	yeah
B	and it would be cheaper than the flight

B	what are you gonna do?
C	how are you gonna even get to Stansted for a six o'clock flight?
C	ah
B	and we'll just and she's got free parking from some connection at work or something

A	er
C	yeah
A	on the ninth
C	yeah
A	and then an interview
C	yeah
A	and then if it all goes to plan
C	yeah
A	September
C	for a start date

A	I know
B	prowess
A	it's a three-day interview as well
B	of physical prowess
C	what interview? Sorry?
A	three-day interview
C	like an
B	but the actual face-to-face interview is then as well isn't it?
A	yeah
B	you'd think they'd do that first
A	with four people
B	Cos if you turn out to be fucking mental
A	yeah
B	you've put yourself through all of that training
A	well they probably hope that the mentalists drop out
B	yeah
C	they might be really strong fit mentalists though
B	maybe that's
A	yeah
B	what they want actually
C	machines
B	mm
A	Cannon fodder they'll just say no
C	so what exactly do
A	yep
C	ah
A	than let's go to war
C	but I've seen loads of um I like watching programmes about war
C	and um I think The Navy don't they get loads of like nice like treats? I E you get to go to like Cyprus for like a
A	yeah
C	breather break or something? And everyone's
A	yeah
C	out on the lash or
A	Seven star hotels in Bahrain
C	sunning it up
A	yep
C	yeah
A	yeah

A	yeah
C	that's what your little taxes are paying for
B	what the fuck?
A	yeah
C	that was quick
B	does that look done er enough to you?
C	yeah it does actually
B	I don't think you'd want it in longer than that
C	no
C	right in the middle to make sure it's hot
C	Good
B	huh huh huh
C	is it hot?

A	well that's the alternative
C	yeah
A	um I'm gonna be too old to apply as an officer
C	yeah
A	yeah
A	and they said well basically if you're in the top three percent of applicants we'll try and apply for an age waiver
C	oh
A	the stupid ten days that I'm too old by
C	oh my God
A	it's crap
B	Cos you'll have done everything else while you're twenty-five won't you
A	yeah
B	it's
A	yeah
B	is that the idea?
C	if it
A	mm
C	yeah? Okay
A	yeah
A	yep

C	I went to Padova
A	oh yeah
C	oh really?
A	yeah
C	yeah yeah
A	ah
C	it was like it was a bit of a joke really
A	italians are so slow at doing everything
C	yeah
A	is that what you were gonna say?
C	and like my Italian wasn't very good
A	oh yeah
C	mean and evil
B	the guy
C	yeah
B	um that phrase that he used to shout at people
C	oh
B	yeah yeah
C	like pig whore
B	the worst thing you could ever say
C	he used to scream it across the office
C	he was the like head er head solicitor
B	wasn't it that the girls wouldn't tell you what it meant cos they were so horrified by it?
A	it's like we'd say mother fucker
B	virgin Mary fucker
A	yeah
C	I think my mum had to tell me what it meant
C	maybe she
B	I suppose everyone knows the C word
C	huh
B	polite society would say it
A	yeah it's as bad as the C word  it's as bad as the C word
B	so your mum would know it
C	he used to scream it across the office
C	or he'd be like what have you done? In Italian
B	disgraceful
C	fine
B	they can't have people like that
A	no
C	no? Okay
B	bloody hell
C	what for?
A	I know
C	what was the reasoning behind this?
A	stupid dieting
B	you are being so hardcore
C	er like er
A	I know
C	do you have to is there like certain criteria for your like navy intake? Like weight or height or eyesight or fitness
A	no
C	level?
A	you have to I've had my eyes done
C	yeah
A	my eyes tested
C	mm
A	um
C	is that  is that  hard?
B	it's fucking hard
C	okay
A	I'm at fifteen and a half now
B	mm
A	still not what it was like before my leg got hit
B	mm
C	mm
A	um
C	okay
A	but my cos your BMI's supposed to be like maximum of twenty-five
C	oh
A	but um she said when you go there like they're a doctor
B	mhm
A	big bangers
C	yeah
A	so
B	Cos that's the thing
A	yeah
B	er like and if you're  if you're  really muscly that you'll weigh more won't you
A	yeah
B	in theory they've gotta actually take quite a lot of factors into consideration surely?
A	mm
B	mm
C	God
A	my thighs are fucking killing though after this week
B	mm
C	it just illustrates your commitment
A	mm
C	it must be really hard
B	it's impressive that you're doing it
A	yeah it's a bit of a
C	yeah
A	it's a bit of a mick take
B	mm
C	mm
B	it's just er bad timing with the Easter weekend
A	mm
C	alcohol's got a lot of calories in it though
A	yep
C	do you drink  do you drink  much?
A	did drink
C	okay
A	yes
C	okay
A	now not
C	Good
A	secret calorie
C	yeah
B	mm
A	buggers
B	mm
C	well good luck with it all
A	thanks
C	it'd be so amazing if you got it
B	mm
A	mm
C	but if you get so close and then not get it you
B	mm
C	just go out on an absolute bender and just completely
B	well especially
A	yeah
B	if it's a physical thing that's letting you down
A	yeah
B	as opposed to being mentally prepared and
A	yeah
B	able to do it
A	if I fail because I go to the interview and they're like no you're just not cut out to do it
C	yeah
A	you're not the right candidate then
B	mm
A	fair enough
B	mm
A	but if I go there and it's because of this fucking leg I'm gonna be so pissed
B	mhm
C	but the thing is though
C	they should consider that once you get into it you will be um you know um taking part in their like regime
B	mm
C	so you
A	yeah
C	physically wouldn't be able to you know be overweight
A	yeah
C	in your day-to-day work
B	mhm
C	I assume that they're gonna be keeping you
A	yeah
C	doing stuff so
B	and they're gonna have actual you know proper properly trained people to help you
A	yeah
B	you know maintain your fitness
A	they say when you get there to do the fitness test for three days after I do the
C	yeah
A	you need to show that you're kind of well-motivated to push yourself as hard as you possibly can
B	mm
A	it's more like an attitude thing I suppose
C	yeah
A	so there'll be no ah I'm dying
B	mm
unknown_female	right
A	bye
B	see you
C	bye
A	yeah
C	I think they should test you on that rather than your actual level now
A	yeah yeah
B	mm
A	they put you under they have like er a group thing
C	oh my God
A	then they give you a different problem then you have to er lead the group to work it out
B	shitting hell
A	more fucking maths tests
B	that's just rude
C	what you've got in your favour is that you're female I reckon
A	mm
C	really?
A	yeah
B	oh
A	the only thing you get leeway with is there's one some massive missile something or other that you have to lift that's some ridiculous kilogram-ness
B	fuck me
C	have you always wanted to do this? Or did it come to you sort of randomly in a dream?
B	she came back from Christmas and was like right I'm joining The Navy
C	really? Oh right
B	mm
A	yes
B	yeah
C	oh
B	I like swimming
A	I like shoes
B	yeah
A	no my cousin's in The Navy
C	mm
B	I think that's it
B	or friends who've been in the forces it does sort of put the idea in your head
A	mm
B	well that's a viable career option
A	yeah I think if he hadn't I would never considered it
B	and did he
B	did he go to uni? Or he went straight into The Navy?
A	straight into The Navy
B	mm
A	probably when he was huh about seventeen until about twenty-one twenty-two
B	did he have a job?
B	mhm
B	mhm
A	then came back and joined The Navy
C	no
A	yeah
A	um
A	um and he was like oh yeah I'm in a seven star hotel in Bahrain
A	just rub it in
C	is it  is it
B	mm
C	ranks of
A	yeah
C	seventeen? Well like maybe eighteen
A	seventeen year olds
C	nineteen year olds
B	mm
A	yeah
C	there's no middle ground?
A	no
C	isn't that interesting
A	it's weird isn't it
C	yeah
A	I don't really get it
C	it's quite unique to have that
A	there's one above like cos to do the job that I want to do you don't need a degree
C	mm
A	so the entry's the same
C	yeah
A	higher than these people who just got A-levels
C	okay
A	but everyone enters at the same level
B	mm
A	but then they don't split
B	mm
A	entry level
C	that's it yes
A	and then it's up to you
B	fuck
B	in the officers
A	yep
B	and some of them have worked just in hospitality?
A	yeah
B	so they could go in and like cook dinner?
A	you wouldn't get  you wouldn't get  a chef going in as an officer
B	oh really?
A	you might get um
B	but they're more like the
A	yeah
B	sure that all the food's been ordered and
B	mm
A	and the people who make sure stuff's posted right
B	mm
A	and the stuff people that ship the missiles
B	ship the missiles
A	and the accountants
B	mm
A	so people who are chefs or something that's not you wouldn't require a degree for
B	mm
A	wouldn't be able to go in as an officer anyway
B	mm
A	it wouldn't require that type of qualification
B	mm
A	it's all a bit nuts
B	it sounds mental to me
A	yeah
B	when we watched the propaganda DVD
B	when that came through
C	oh
B	I was like
C	what was it like?
A	yeah
C	what? Like a big holiday? Or?
B	but they all had like er er like serene expressions on their faces
A	what about the missiles?
B	what about the war?
C	I
B	yeah
C	I can't remember it
B	Bodiam?
A	what?
C	turned into like a sort of um reception centre like processing them
B	well
B	imagine when they er evacuated people out of Libya
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	exactly
B	that would've been them
A	or Haiti or
B	so that would be you
C	yeah
C	and like make a manifest in an Excel spreadsheet
C	really real
C	and I'd literally been in the Foreign Office for like two or three
B	mm
C	like a really short period of time
B	that's really early
C	anyway after
B	mm
C	and you walk down it
A	what the fuck?
C	thing
B	yeah
C	ever
B	Libya
C	Libya
A	yeah
C	and then you guys obviously to actually drive it or whatever
B	drive the boat
C	drive the boat
A	drive the boat
C	yeah
B	mm
C	and that would've obviously been The Navy right? So
B	oh I'd forgotten about that
C	they gave me a free jacket
A	winner
C	yeah
C	it was horrible and cheap and nasty
C	I think I took it to
C	some sort of like yeah
A	yeah
C	but
A	of women in The Navy's something really little like twelve percent or something
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	and he that's like his job in The Navy is to be a padre
B	mm
C	I didn't know that
A	yeah
C	so I learnt that
B	maybe that's what they call them in the
A	they
B	yeah
A	mm
B	but if you think that The Navy's
B	the Navy's pretty intense isn't it
A	mm
B	and they're fucking insane
C	we know
B	we've had experience of marines
C	mm
A	yeah
B	hot and fucking mental
A	yeah
B	Cos
C	mental
B	cos they're trained to like forget about pain
A	yeah
C	mm
A	my friend's er married to one
B	fire guns in people's face
A	he's a bit weird
A	could carry you home though
C	yeah
B	that's what you want
