C	no
B	oh
C	no idea why they're called dog roses
C	er they got a really lovely perfume I don't know why they have such nice perfume compared to other flowers

B	why's it called peace?
C	shrub roses
C	why's it called peace?
A	well
B	like surely it's like the biggest strongest
C	I think perhaps they just wanted to have a message of peace the person who grew it maybe
A	dog
B	I don't know about that can be used as a lethal weapon
C	I don't maybe they just
B	I've seen them
C	don't have many people growing it who want to call call it things like

C	yeah and is it a bit decayed then?
B	I know I know
C	mm

C	mm
B	like cos you're trying to listen to them
B	and not using full stops and things
C	do you know in some classrooms in America
B	taken what out?
C	taken the book out
B	why?
C	cos it was exposing
B	mm
C	only some
B	mm
C	yeah
B	she's a proper badass

A	going upstairs just
B	in my mind or what?
C	in your mind yeah

C	yeah
B	I dunno I
C	yeah
B	but now I know
B	Calpurnia's the servant
A	let's go
B	things

B	can't remember exactly
C	think we have to do forty-five don't we?
B	no
C	yeah let's do it for a bit longer anyway
B	okay cos the first thing
C	just to be on the safe side
B	cos er on the on the dinner table we did thirty-one minutes but I just counted that as thirty minutes
C	cos I might have to take bits off so
B	and then and then
C	do the full one
B	and then we did twenty-five minutes then it's thirty-five minutes and then
C	so did you

B	yeah but he can get the he can get the untrashy girls as well
C	well yeah but if he's
C	going here there and
B	everyone

C	mm
B	cos like he's he does a lot more sport and his dad's he has like a
C	mm
B	and like
C	yeah
B	and
C	mm
B	if I flex
C	I dunno
B	I think a lot a lot of
C	mm
B	not all of it but a lot of his weight is because he is quite strong
C	yeah he doesn't look unfit does he? so
B	no
C	yeah
B	I don't think
C	mm
B	like he
C	would you do soccer?
B	no
C	less injuries though
B	mm?
C	less injuries
B	yeah but like
C	well you don't know I suppose you do you do like playing football don't you?
B	erm
C	mm

B	I don't know about that
C	mm
B	I don't know about that
C	yeah
B	you know I love rugby
C	yeah
B	and soccer I I just
C	mm
B	cos I feel like I have to commit like I'm committing a lot of my free time to do rugby
C	yeah
B	when like
C	yeah
B	but I really do like rugby
C	yeah
B	I just like to be playing it with
C	yeah
B	but
C	really?
B	a lot of them
C	mm
B	yeah like most of
C	yeah you did say that
B	seen his Instagram?
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	mm
B	cos he's my cousin
C	mm
B	and they're like
C	mm
B	and I like
C	how do you mean? what because he puts things like his beats headphones on is that what they mean?
B	no like in front of his friends
C	mm
B	er that aren't nice people
C	yeah
B	and like he does a lot of photos like back from
C	mm
C	mm
B	I know that's
C	yes
B	er no
C	no I don't know
B	he
C	to be honest I don't really like
B	he hangs around with the popular kids
C	yeah
B	they'd be getting all the girls and
C	mm
B	and he tells me that that he like he he they do mock him like sometimes and he doesn't like it
C	what his friends?
B	his friends
C	has he got any nice friends?
B	he says
C	yeah
B	cos like
C	yeah
B	like
C	yeah
B	and then he'd be like made fun of
C	yeah
B	in front of all the girls and everyone
C	yeah
B	and
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	be hard wouldn't it if he was hanging out with all the popular but not very nice kids?
B	it would be cos we wouldn't be in the same group
C	yeah
B	cos like if I wanted to
C	yeah
B	anyone can get into the popular group if they want
C	yeah
B	but they'll be in the group
C	yeah
B	many people are like that they tag along constantly
C	yeah
B	they they be
C	yeah
B	just so they can be popular
C	yeah
B	and they never are popular
C	kinda sell your soul if you do that though don't you?
B	like
C	yeah
B	and
C	I
B	yeah
C	amazingly enough
C	mm
B	like
C	mm
B	there was this other popular group
C	okay
B	and then
C	mm
B	like
C	mm
B	because I know why he's doing it
C	yeah
B	he's trying to be popular
C	okay
B	I'm just
C	yeah
B	and you can see it
C	yeah
B	he's just kind of on
C	it's better to be in your own tiny little gang or even just have one friend rather than be
B	yeah
C	at the bottom end of a popular gang
B	it really is
C	that's kinda that's like the worst of the worst isn't it?
B	it really is I hate it I just
C	all your friends seem really nice
B	yeah
C	seem really lovely really nice
C	oh
B	like
C	mm
B	in front of the popular people
C	yeah
B	but then when you're just on a
C	yeah
B	but he's really
C	yeah
B	when it's just you and him
C	yeah
B	which is kind of
B	so like he's
C	that's a good way of putting it
B	I mean like he's in the stage
C	yeah
B	and er just because like
C	yeah
B	and he's kind of not being himself to me
C	yeah
B	which shows that he's gonna be like that but extreme
C	yeah
B	with the other people which
C	yeah
B	I don't know
C	yeah
B	I don't think I've been in stage two though
C	yeah
B	in in
C	mm
B	and I wasn't really trailing behind
C	no
B	like but they weren't really that mean
C	they were alright really weren't they?
B	yeah right
C	yeah
B	but
C	mm
B	like
C	yeah
B	because he he he'd be
B	yeah
C	or you you were
B	like when we were trying to play Jenga he'd just
C	he's hard work
B	jump the table on purpose
C	yeah
A	is there a cunning reason
C	erm
A	oh
C	sorry
B	yeah
C	do you know what I mean I just think er?
B	I'm gonna make sure
C	yeah
B	I dunno how how to stop
C	you have to hope for the best I don't think you can stop
B	like you can't say like don't really hang out with them can you?
C	no but
B	cos then they're gonna wanna hang out with them
C	no
B	and they're gonna be unhappy with anyone else
C	I suppose it's like with you I've tried to just talk with you all the way through and if things come up I've tried to sort of say
B	yeah I think you have to
C	yeah
B	like to be humble cos like popular people aren't humble at all
C	yeah
B	like I'm
C	mm
B	and he was like who are you?
C	mm
B	like I don't even know you
C	mm
B	which is really insulting cos
C	yeah it's really is I do
B	I I met him in the class before
C	it's really unnecessary as well
B	it got him a reputation
C	a reputation amongst other twats though that's the thing
B	I know
C	and
B	I've seen many
C	it won't necessarily stop you in life like like when I had my friends my
B	oh yeah he's not my friend
C	yeah he's not your friend but anyway these blokes
B	yeah I know that
C	do you cos I didn't know that?
B	I
C	I didn't know that at the time I wish I did cos I should've gone off with one of those scientists
B	how how do you know then?
C	cos somebody in the end told me
B	oh
C	and he actually
C	so yeah you don't
B	yeah
C	about the other group do you?
B	no
C	also it's completely different out in life isn't it once school stops finishes
B	do you
C	mm
B	like
C	but he's alright guy isn't he?
B	yeah he's
C	to be honest he's
B	yeah yeah and like
B	and then we have
C	that's not really nice for
B	and yeah
C	do people do people look up to
B	er people see
C	yeah
B	like
C	yeah
B	I mean like if you're good at sports VIP pass to the popular group
C	so that's quite cool isn't it? so he could if he wanted but he doesn't
B	I mean he couldn't be the
C	mm
B	three's like
C	yeah
B	and let's let's say
C	yeah
B	and these guys are like
C	right
B	most of them are
C	yeah
B	sometimes sometimes the people in the middle
C	yeah
B	are are okay
C	yeah
B	and
C	okay
B	and then
C	okay
B	but
C	okay
B	like
C	he's just one of those characters
B	he's just funny
C	yeah
B	and
C	yeah
B	no I I don't
C	actually in a weird way I little bit surprised that you've not been cos you used to be
B	yeah
C	all the time
B	yeah
C	I'm quite pleased about that
B	yeah
C	even though I think you probably are sometimes a bit aren't you?
B	no I don't think
C	not at all?
B	no I don't
C	mm okay
B	I mean
B	okay
C	did people laugh?
B	er
B	and then I think she tried to embarrass me
B	that's only one though
C	yeah that's very oh
C	do you wanna ask
B	oh yeah
