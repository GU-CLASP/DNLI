unknown_female	mm
E	d'you know what I mean like?
C	like
E	it doesn't do them any favours
[ANNOTATION]	They get a favour by someone	Contradiction
C	from from the outsider's point of view cos I
A	no
C	but especially hearing about this laptop thing
B	I I knew before I met you
C	I
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B were aware of some things before he/she met the other speaker	Entailment
C	like I don't think I would even go to the extent of putting somebody's like Ipad
E	no
C	cos if somebody had done that to me I'd be fucking livid like beyond
B	mm that is so unfair
unknown_female	yeah
D	like that's what'd stick in my head?
unknown_female	yeah
C	it's not just that though like why would you even bother like?
D	well you're hurting yourself
C	yes okay you don't like them they don't like you but that
[ANNOTATION]	One speaker is hurting him/herself by thinking nonsense things	Neutral
A	yeah
C	like
A	but I I don't think I
C	no
E	I think though
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker E thinks that the other speakers should avoid doing stupid thoughts	Neutral
A	mm

E	I just knew
A	the piggy thing what?
E	yeah

E	whaaat?
E	that's real weird
A	like
unknown_female	yeah
A	because if
E	cos I don't think they think it I think they just think you're the enemy and that's it
C	they obviously need to take a good look at themselves then
A	really seriously they do because I've got more
C	yeah to be in that state like
