A	so we're back in the room here we are right
B	I've eaten too much and I've got to eat again
A	I know
B	in an hour
A	you'll manage you'll manage
A	strenuous gym session today
B	it was awful it was really bad and I hadn't eaten enough breakfast and er I felt it
A	mm that's not so good
B	but he's nice he said it was okay he high-fived me
A	but if you're gonna have a workout and you haven't eaten enough but you know that before you go so you want to eat but then you end up wanting to boke while you're exercising
B	yeah yeah so it's you know er trying to eat erm
A	it's getting the balance isn't it?
B	eat enough but leaving enough time for you to start digesting
A	yeah
B	erm and in the mornings
A	yeah
B	it's not so easy to get the timings right
A	oh my worst one one time I quite often used to have a smoothie or a shake or whatever before I went to the gym and and I I only needed to
B	mm
[ANNOTATION]	He felt bad because he hadn't had enough for breakfast.	Entailment
A	so I mixed up some oats in my smoothie and oh my god I nearly threw up quite a few times it was really hard going
B	yeah
A	so never have an oaty smoothie before gym time
B	yeah it's good for after
A	yeah right clear left
B	oh go go go go bloody hell yes
A	come on then
B	well done road fairies
A	thank you traffic pixie
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Oat smoothies are perfect for before going to the gym, not so much for after.	Contradiction
A	yay
B	road fairies
A	road fairies and traffic pixies I love it
B	I was like
A	well road
A	road fairies is pretty cool I like that
B	er yes
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	They are people who go to the gym.	Entailment
A	there might be some slippery bits or skiddy bits or bits where lorries need to go a bit slower
B	yeah I don't know if it is or if it is just er oh I don't know
A	well there's one just back there which I imagine is every time someone pulls in or out of the car park
B	yeah possibly
A	as we've just done that's bound to hold traffic up a little bit cos it only takes one car to brake and come to a stop to let somebody in and
B	yeah or
B	yeah
A	anyway erm Simon says we'll be there at ten to three so another forty minutes
[ANNOTATION]	They are canoeing to get there.	Contradiction
B	oh okay okay okay
A	and thirty-eight kilometres thirty minutes well we're not really doing
B	mm mm
A	to let her know
B	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Speker A has been riding a car since he was seventeen.	Neutral
A	I guess five past three
B	yeah
A	I did text her from erm the restaurant to say that we'd be there I think we said ten I said ten to three something like that I'm just thinking just so they're not rushing to get off the piste and get changed to meet us
B	yeah
A	probably get a another an extra ski run in or something
B	mm
A	mm
A	oh okay
B	sorry
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A called a female.	Contradiction
A	that's alright
B	er you know I'm so used to it now that I've forgotten that it's there
A	I know
B	I feel like I don't need to talk because it's I just forget about it
A	yeah pros and cons you know it's it's we're probably getting much more natural conversation cos we forget it's there
B	yes
A	but at the same time
B	yeah
B	sorry I'm just thinking
A	yeah
B	what an interesting car what make is that?
A	that is a Chrysler I do believe but I'm not sure I've heard of the
B	no I've not
A	it's a Polish thing
[ANNOTATION]	Chrysler is an expensive car make.	Neutral
[ANNOTATION]	Chrysler is motorbike make.	Neutral
B	it's an interesting car to have
A	mm I think it's Chrysler anyway a similar logo if not
B	yeah
A	that's an American make I think
B	big car big wheels
A	not that big
[ANNOTATION]	The Chrysler car is rather small.	Contradiction
A	what have you been driving?
B	er Toyota Yaris
A	oh
B	yes
A	yeah
B	but I haven't driven for five years six years
A	oh my god you need to do that thing
B	er
[ANNOTATION]	It's been a while since the last time speaker B drove a car.	Entailment
A	do you not do it when you go on holiday? hire a car?
B	no
B	don't do it when I go to England erm should but
A	ah
B	and this is exactly what my mum did she learned to drive when she was in her twenties and then didn't drive until she was forty something
A	mm
B	and she had to have lessons
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B doesn't rent a car when traveling.	Entailment
A	same with my dad
B	and I imagine that's what's gonna happen to me er it doesn't help that I'm never in the country erm or never you know
A	yeah
B	er I mean I wouldn't wanna drive abroad anyway
A	so actually you could just forget about that now forget about the anxiety and just say
B	start again
[ANNOTATION]	It is not stressful to drive a car.	Contradiction
A	I am not a driver
B	yes I can't drive
A	and then if at some point where your life situation circumstances make you think oh I'd like to drive again
B	yeah
A	get some lessons then
B	it was you know I really wanted to do it last summer
A	mm
B	but I just simply wasn't
A	what? to drive to go places?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	or just to sort of drive myself around the town
A	yeah
B	see my friends or whatever erm
A	I've gotta say Poland isn't easy
B	no yeah
A	erm it is if you think erm if you kind of get in your head nobody's thinking anything about me nobody's judging me and once you get that in your head you're fine you can get on and drive but but there is like I was saying to you before you expect it on motorways you pull out to overtake at the last possible minute and you get in again at the
B	yeah
A	at the
B	mm
A	so you know I kind of feel sometimes I'm driving like a dickhead but that's
B	yeah it's normal
A	it's expected that's the culture that's the custom so really in just being in Rome and doing as the Romans do but it is pretty anxiety-inducing sometimes
B	mm
A	so no probably not the best country
B	no
A	I don't think the Spanish are much better are they?
B	I wouldn't yeah I wouldn't drive abroad erm anywhere er but I really want to
A	I recommend Ireland Ireland's really chilled
B	yeah I
A	north and south
B	really just need to start driving in England
B	and I just wasn't there enough to
A	mm
B	warrant getting lessons or paying for insurance
A	yeah
A	and there's not much point if you're gonna leave the country again
B	yeah exactly so but I really wanted to do it just for me more than anything else
A	yeah
B	but was not to be
A	it will come back it's a bit like the skiing there's a big degree of muscle memory I think er
B	yeah
A	once you start making your body perform those manoeuvres as it were it erm
B	uhu
A	becomes unconscious again pretty quickly
B	yeah
B	I was saying that to
A	mm
A	mm
B	or my body needs to understand what it's supposed to do
A	yeah
B	mm
A	yeah
B	mm yeah I just need some practice
A	hang on a minute this looks like my
B	uhu
[ANNOTATION]	That speaker B is an expert.	Contradiction
A	this looks like the junction where I would normally turn right
B	ah so you've been here before
A	mm erm isn't it funny? I don't remember ever seeing that restaurant we've just been to
B	ah
A	probably because it's not
B	yeah it's
A	in my
B	yeah
A	this is really pretty oh light's green now I was gonna take a
B	yeah I thought there would be traffic lights
A	see Father Christmas there?
B	oh bless
A	oh erm my neighbours in
A	waving at you it's just really nice and they had a wooden Rudolph and his sleigh as well that was about ten feet from left to right and er yeah that was all lit up it was really nice
B	right now we're through those lights we might
A	which is why we have
B	yeah we might cos it was so sort of consistently stopping and starting wasn't it?
[ANNOTATION]	That people were watching a reindeer display.	Neutral
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	That the reindeer display is lit up sometimes.	Entailment
B	erm claw back some time
B	I'm just obsessed
A	your obsession with time it doesn't exist there's nothing to claw back
B	no I know
A	ah
B	I can't help it
A	I'm kind of at the stage in life now as well where if I'm running late and I say to someone oh I'm sorry running late if I think I'm gonna be there at five past I'll message and say oh I'll see you about quarter past and then I just really relax and don't drive like a dickhead
B	mm
A	and the person the other end isn't anxiously looking out of the window or whatever if people do that sort of thing I don't know
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B doesn't keep track of time too well.	Entailment
B	mm
A	erm
B	mm
A	you might as well just be late in a relaxed kind of a way
B	I can't er I hate being late
A	but would you rather
B	yeah I'd rather
A	rush around like an idiot and get there at five past or three minutes past and still be late
B	mm
A	but be all anxious and stressed?
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B gets stressed out easily.	Entailment
B	it depends who er or what I'm doing
A	mm
B	what who I'm meeting I suppose but you know in the mornings I hate rushing
A	yeah me too
B	er and in the mornings before work I would much rather wake up at I don't know six fifteen to start work at eight fifteen
A	yeah
B	and just really casually have a shower
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B wakes up right before it's time to leave for work.	Contradiction
A	yeah
B	eat something
A	yeah
B	and do a bit of preparation er
A	drink tea
B	drink tea maybe watch something or listen to something
A	read a book yeah
B	er rather than
A	yeah
B	see this is me waking up at six fifteen and doing whatever
A	last minute clean teeth wash dress out
B	whereas
B	er er er have a shower
A	and he's still got a ten minute walk?
B	yeah have a shower get dressed
A	that's impressive
B	and go
A	mm
B	but I just can't not eat in the mornings
A	you wow
B	yeah so that's
A	that's good
A	what?
B	that's where we're going oh no it's not
A	where are we going?
B	there's a swimming pool there
A	oh
A	oh shit I forgot my swimming goggles ah
B	yeah I
A	oh well
B	never mind
A	oh what's the limit here? I'm just going extra slow cos of that speed camera
A	yeah no I have got some here
B	mm
A	but actually no I don't really like swimming that much I used to go
B	mm
A	I used to bunk off work quite a bit actually I used to say I'm going to this shop in this part of the country and maybe I would go but maybe I'd leave an hour before I was really meant to or they thought I was
B	mm
A	and then I'd go to the gym in
B	mm
A	and
B	yeah
A	and it just seemed so necessary to have that outlet for myself and that time
B	mm mm mm
A	for me and nobody else
B	yep
A	really really necessary
B	and you know it's so good for you too
A	mm
B	yeah
B	endorphins and I know people sort of say oh it's so cathartic it's therapeutic you know you get out all of your anger and stress and you think well I don't really know if I agree with that but
A	mm
B	I agree with you're doing something on a regular basis in which you are trying to improve you know
A	mm
B	and over time you will because that's how that's how
A	mm
B	you know you'll be able to go faster or lift something else up and that is I think good for your mind
A	yeah that's interesting
B	setting goals and meeting them
A	I don't do that
B	mm
A	yeah
B	yeah well that's
A	different personality type I suppose
B	yeah that's how I sort of er see it I don't really like
B	but with myself I'm excellent
A	yeah
B	yes
A	no I just like to go because it feels good
B	mm
A	and I like I used to get to that point with running where I felt I could run forever
B	mm
A	and it just felt so good
B	what sort of distances?
A	I used to only do I used to do five K
B	mm
A	so three miles in about thirty-eight minutes
B	mm
A	or forty minutes
B	mm
A	erm which is incredibly slow but I didn't care
B	yeah if you like
A	yeah I
B	mm
A	and even in my movement and my doeyness I'm it's very unusual I just don't get
B	mm
A	rush that some people get with their exercise oh what's for sale here? it looks like my fire extinguisher man
B	oh it's regional socks and cheese
B	in that little cabin
A	oh cool
B	socks and cheese
B	a winning combination gets a lot of passing trade
A	yeah what more do you need? yeah
B	erm
A	so yeah I just it's all I don't get that
B	mm
A	just in a
B	mm
A	but
B	mm
A	and it was always a faster faster faster and I used to think fuck off fuck off fuck off
A	I'll go at my own speed and I used to get a bit stubborn then and
B	yeah
A	go really slow and not enjoy it and then it was usually women erm not always older women but often older women running the spin classes that lull you into a false sense of security with making sure you warm through properly at the beginning you might have a running track erm rather than sprint
B	mm
A	and you just kind of warm into it gradually and within about twenty minutes I'd be working incredibly hard and I'd be knackered
B	mm
[ANNOTATION]	A often got very tired during workout classes.	Entailment
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	with spinning
A	business
B	I used to sort of I used to go spinning erm when I was at uni and I'd look at the clock and it'd be like quarter past I'd be like fuck I've got to do this for another thirty minutes? I'm gonna die
A	yeah
B	I'm not gonna make it
A	mm
B	and there was this trainer called
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	B found his spinning classes very tiring when he was studying at the university.	Entailment
B	you know
A	oh my goodness
B	er and people
A	yeah
B	stared at her
A	well they probably do in Poland
B	yeah
A	maybe less so in England
B	cos it's just a different type of body
A	yeah
B	cos people are so slim erm
A	mm
B	erm
[ANNOTATION]	People in Poland don't care about how others look in fitness classes.	Contradiction
B	I'll never be able to beat anyone up in a fight I'd be crap but if I looked oh I'm not gonna mess with her she looked like she
A	you strike me more a lover than a fighter
B	I am absolutely yeah
B	but I really want to give the impression of
A	why?
B	I just think that's the sort of ideal body that I want someone who's you know sort of not tough looking
B	no that's not I'm not really phrasing this very well
A	yeah
B	and a body that looks like it can handle you know handle itself or handle
A	the rigours of teaching English as a foreign language
A	ah dear yeah
[ANNOTATION]	B wants to look like he's really fit.	Entailment
B	mm
[ANNOTATION]	B is a nice guy who wants to look tough.	Entailment
B	I think that's rather a male thing that men wouldn't actually sort of articulate which is you know you're looking you wanna look big so no one messes with you
A	mm
B	er but I don't think
B	I'm really saying that
B	I wanna be a meathead
A	you want to be a meathead
B	I said to
B	I was like I know but
[ANNOTATION]	Men don't care whether or not their body looks weak.	Contradiction
A	yeah used to get a lot of those at
B	hate them
A	the I know the type that you mean
B	that's very kind
A	I know possibly a fair bit of grunting
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	mm and they're just in the way
A	yeah
A	yeah?
B	yeah
A	oh my goodness
B	it's not you know before it before he can start
A	wow
B	erm
A	I'm just tempted to join your gym just so I can come and shake your hand
B	yeah
A	yo sister
B	in
A	did you?
B	and see if they'd shake it
A	did they?
B	yeah
B	no they'd shake it erm so just
A	so were there other women in the gym at the time?
B	no usually not no
A	oh okay
B	I once went to the gym on the Saturday before Easter Sunday
A	mm
B	and I was there for er I don't know ninety minutes and not another single woman was there cos they were all I don't know cooking and cleaning in preparation for Easter Sunday
B	and it was packed I think they'd the women had sent men
A	yeah
B	and it was like men and their sons as well
A	oh wow
B	er to the gym just to get them out of the house and obviously I wasn't gonna be cooking and preparing a family meal so I was there
A	yeah
A	yeah?
B	only one man says hello to me in this gym yeah
A	is it cos you're a foreigner?
B	they don't know I'm a foreigner
A	oh
B	I suppose more cos I wouldn't
A	yeah
B	know necessarily but now that I've got this trainer and we're talking in English I think more people are clocking on or not caring at all
A	mm
B	no
B	yep
A	and then we're branching off
A	so what time did we leave? it was about twenty past eleven wasn't it? and then we
B	it was half eleven at
A	was it half eleven?
A	and we stopped for about forty minutes
B	did we?
A	or half an hour
B	worth it for the er for the fire
A	ah the fire was great yeah I don't think I've ever been in a public toilet where my piss is steamed cos it's so cold
B	it was bloody cold in those toilets
A	that was pretty impressive
B	I sat down and thought
A	I know
B	oh my god er this seat's wet but it was just really cold
B	peel off
A	I was grateful it wasn't a metal seat
B	leave half of your bum
A	yeah
B	your insides flop out down the toilet
A	oops
A	yeah
B	mm
A	maybe that's why there are so many plastic toilet seats here
B	I've not seen a metal toilet seat I don't think in my whole life
A	oh I have in Northern Ireland but they're the sort of
B	oh
A	metal where it's not really a seat it's just metal
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	make yeah
A	so want to take a guess as to what the speed limit might be? I just haven't a clue
B	I don't know
A	there's a picture of silhouetted buildings with a cross through it
B	so maybe it's a
A	so it's either seventy or ninety
B	I don't know it's rather suspicious isn't it?
A	that's weird
B	yeah it looks a little bit brighter here doesn't it?
A	mm
B	was a good guess
A	no that's just for round the bend I think
A	oh have we gotta turn left up here? what's erm Simon saying? oh
B	no no it's just saying follow the bend
A	go round the bend
B	yep
A	and then another seventeen K before we think about doing anything
A	yeah
B	I just keep reading about my nose and what's happening now is the capillaries or whatever are really swollen
A	can you build a picture in your mind as to what your nasal passages will look like in six months time when?
B	I'm not really sure what what nasal passages look like
A	or a week or whatever
B	but if I just keep visualizing I don't know I think like a waterfall is what I'm thinking of and just like this sort of gushing water that is clearing everything out
A	okay so that's what you're wanting in the interim then I can join you in this creative visualisation if you like?
A	we'll just imagine your nose gushing but then
B	no not actually
A	okay
B	it's very symbolic
A	like a sort of
B	like nose like love life
B	yeah
A	so yeah your nose will be perfectly clear when you've had a good clear out on the emotional and spiritual levels
B	yep
A	yeah and because it's to do with the breath erm and it comes back to lungs again it's lung chi and spleen chi
B	what does the spleen do?
A	I think that was all incorporated in the lung thing do you remember
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	the photocopy or photograph
A	yeah it's cool so it's all about your boundaries
B	yes
A	and the give and take in life so at the moment you've still got all of this in so if you're wanting to be visualising this streaming nose then that's getting everything out getting all of the toxic substances out
B	yeah
A	the toxic emotions the toxic whatever so I imagine your nose will piss like Niagara Falls for a day or two and then it'll be clear as the Swiss Alps
B	air
A	or something
A	yeah
B	good good good
A	yay
B	getting high getting more
A	so
B	slippy
A	slippiness okay
B	yeah
A	so I still
B	steer into a skid yes
A	mm
B	good advice steer into a corner as well
A	steer into a corner?
A	what?
B	I suppose if you're turning a corner you are steering
B	I don't know what I'm saying
A	yeah no I know what you mean if you're going round a bend you decelerate
B	yeah and so and speed out of a corner this corner
A	and then yeah once you're passed the halfway point foot on the accelerator to power out
B	what a strange place to wait for a bus I wonder where he came from?
A	that's a good question there are no houses and a big hill
B	mm
A	oh I saw that once there was erm no but I was in Australia and there was a guy on the opposite platform got out of a bus
B	yeah
A	so
B	it's happened to me and I got on three buses
A	oh god
B	and then I had to get off
A	oh jeez
B	oh I was really sick
A	that's bad
B	we've had this conversation before
A	oh yes that's right
B	yeah
A	you were moving to Poland
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	yeah
B	er but I've also done it when I was really hung-over and I was going from
A	ah
B	and cover the person in front of me in sick
B	but I really had to do mind over matter and lots of breathing
A	wow well done
B	er
[ANNOTATION]	father small boy	Neutral
A	and you got all the way there?
B	I got all the way there
A	mm
B	cos I thought I don't know where I am if I get off this bus
A	yeah and there might not be another one until Tuesday yeah
B	there might not be another one
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	two people are very sad	Contradiction
B	just had to
A	oh yeah they do I noticed that
B	why? right so
A	scarves sometimes hats all of their outerwear thick coats with fleece linings and
B	yeah
A	fur on the hoods
B	I just don't think
B	how those people can feel any temperature they can stand outside in really cold temperatures and not feel it
A	yeah
B	but then they can sit on boiling buses
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	wendy okay	Contradiction
B	I
A	in the same clothes
[ANNOTATION]	true are false any answer about in	Contradiction
B	yeah
A	and not break a sweat amazing
B	I have to on a bus take off everything down to like my
A	yeah
B	first layer
A	me too almost down to the vest and I'm still sweating
A	yeah
B	awful
A	yeah I've felt almost sick on a bus before now
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	wendy okay	Entailment
A	and had to keep pressing my bare forearms against the cold window to try and get some cool
B	yeah
A	its been so unbelievably hot on a bus where was that? that was
B	yeah it's just crazy
A	and Polish people were there for more than an hour in their winter clothes
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	two people are very sad	Neutral
A	I really don't know how they do it
B	I'm saying this you know with my coat on
A	I know
B	but
A	oh yeah getting me to turn the turn the temperature down you've got your coat on
B	oh sorry
B	I don't wanna take it off now I'm comfortable
A	fair enough
B	ah I will do
A	do you know what? I'm not sure if I can be arsed skiing this evening I might just fancy a steam and then ski in the morning tomorrow
B	mm I definitely wanna do some sparry stuff
A	and then steam again
B	but I wouldn't mind just sitting in a chair and reading my book
A	yeah
B	and sort of looking out the window
A	no I I've just got this steam idea in my head I haven't had a steam since probably July or August probably July realistically speaking
B	I think this'll be really good for me in terms of getting stuff out toxins and that
A	oh yeah
B	oh nice
A	so it's all nice and really strong and I'd say I'll be down about three
B	nice
A	really perfect
A	it's like she likes her space and I like my space
B	yeah
A	and I suppose things can get a little bit intimate in a campervan
B	uhu
A	and er you know I know her well enough to share a small bed with her it wouldn't be a problem erm but yeah I suppose you just
B	yeah she likes hers yeah
A	she likes her van
B	for sure for sure
A	yeah that was lovely we had a fabulous trip around
A	no no there are no signposts so
B	yeah
A	and you you pagan
B	that's lovely
A	so but I could get away with a lot being English that she couldn't being Irish so
B	I wouldn't you know being English I wouldn't want to be from anywhere else
A	I think it opens doors
B	yeah
A	and it can close them a bit as well sometimes
B	yes
A	yeah
B	oh my god
B	yeah in when I lived in Scotland and worked in Scotland
A	mm
B	said
A	that's fantastic
A	what are you doing later?
B	you know and stuff like that
A	that's brilliant
B	I don't really mind
A	no I used to get a lot of friendly abuse from my friends in Northern Ireland
B	yeah yeah friendly abuse as well
A	you know from the
B	get back over your own side
A	the troubles and yeah and I worked for a Catholic organisation and lived in a Catholic community
B	mm
A	so even not being a Christian I was still the Prod
B	mm mm
[ANNOTATION]	The first speaker wasn't Catholic.	Entailment
A	and then at work
B	mm
A	yeah I suppose I could of perceived it as workplace bullying but
A	instead I'd quite often tell them to fuck off so it was fine
A	are you really hot still?
B	I'm no my temperature's fine I'm just
A	okay
B	this window's going a bit steamy
A	steamy
A	in fact you've got the clean one and I've got the dirty one
[ANNOTATION]	It's warm where they are.	Entailment
B	yeah
A	give it a wipe in fact poor
B	yeah
A	you'd think well you'd think they'd've tested that in the aerodynamic tunnel thing at the testy place to
A	I don't know put some mud through it on occasion to see where it ends up
B	mm
A	it's like a little winter wonderland here I think the difference between here and
B	yeah it looks great doesn't it?
B	what time was
A	yeah I think she'd called at mine a little bit before nine

B	oh good she's just lovely
A	she's so lovely isn't she?
B	she's just perfect
A	yeah
B	at everything
A	I wonder though I see a lot of this with Polish women in particular and I suppose I was quite like that myself and I do wonder if it's a female thing is having to be ten times better than anybody else to get the same recognition that an average man gets
B	mm
A	and whether there's any truth in that or whether that's just a perception
B	mm
A	I don't know and it was weird being magnificent and being the best in England
B	mm
A	going over to Northern Ireland
B	mm
A	back in a I dunno you think England's a patriarchy move to Northern Ireland mate bloody hell

[ANNOTATION]	they think highly of teachers	Contradiction
A	I think Denmark in particular teachers are very well respected and Germany to some extent have a
B	mm
A	and once they have so many years in the role they get extra tax breaks and big pensions and things like that it's very well respected
B	oh for sure
A	erm you know perhaps further northern countries

B	but there isn't a vehicle in front is there?
A	I don't know yet we might find out when we're round this corner yeah there are I can see cars are snaking down slowly
B	ah
A	so yeah see what I mean? about this is the culture here do you see the blue Punto?
B	mm how close that car is yeah yeah yeah
A	behind it is getting in the boot and that is exactly the culture but the Punto as far as I'm aware is thinking nothing bad or you know
[ANNOTATION]	these people live in Europe	Neutral
B	yeah
A	nasty about the car that it's trying to get into the boot of so as a driver you just kind of need to accept that people are gonna drive right up your arse and that it's nothing personal it's like being in a car with
B	mm
A	with erm
B	mm
A	and they all drive like that and they're
A	they're not swearing at the car in front they're just going about their business
B	yeah it's just normal uhu
[ANNOTATION]	one person got in a car accident	Neutral
A	it's just what they do erm but as a driver that's more accustomed to having
B	uhu
A	between vehicles erm you can take it a bit personally if you don't know that's what I meant about if you do decide to do some driving lessons
[ANNOTATION]	they both have driver's licenses	Neutral
B	mm
A	here it's

B	god I could be but I don't think I am
A	no
A	no the sign to the right of that one
A	oh well
B	you
A	we could both look in the same direction and have completely different perceptions
B	I just looked at the first one
B	ah that's so funny
A	ah
B	but yes let's ring that number and see what happens
B	ah detox and therapy that's what I need
A	yeah I think you're gonna have a couple of days of that
B	mm
A	it's gonna be great
B	yeah
A	oh wow look at how that snow's falling off that roof
B	oh yeah
A	that's really weird it's almost like it's created a new roof just of snow
A	it's sort of hanging on there
B	no I think if I went skiing today it'd be really dangerous so
A	I don't yeah
B	and my mind's not in it you know my
A	do you fancy popping
B	mm I dunno
A	erm and maybe let her know I don't wanna go skiing this afternoon
B	yeah
A	oh my good god and there's a billboard or a woman in a bikini and a Santa hat jesus
B	yeah but they're advertising
A	motor goods
B	yeah like the
A	ah
B	the walkie-talkie bit in a taxi
A	yeah
B	traffic's still bad
A	you used to get all of that when I was younger Pirelli calendars were still in when I was younger I think the latest Pirelli calendar that American woman whose name I've completely forgotten who's an amazing photographer has photographed for example Serena Williams and
B	yeah it's erm Andy Schumer yeah er Andy
A	yeah
B	erm yeah I saw them
B	yes yes yes yes
A	have you ever seen Life on Mars? the TV series
B	I've seen bits but not the whole thing
A	mm
B	the police
A	yeah that sexism was
B	mm
A	I had all of that growing up I remember my mum erm growing up with all of that and there was a phase in my mum's life I was reminded of it cos I you know I'm going through my stuff at the moment cos I don't wanna be taking everything
B	mm
A	back to England again to store at my uncle's so I'm
B	mm
A	didn't worry about her figure or how she looked or how people perceived her she was just dancing meeting men online
B	mm
A	erm and this was a phase erm after she and her second husband had split up and I'd given her a computer computers were quite new so this computer was the size of a small town but seemed to fit in her house okay and she discovered chat rooms and starting chatting with men and meeting men and
B	mm
A	going out and having a good time and I
B	mm
A	and but I used to cringe sometimes when I saw her around men being quite flirty and accepting a lot of what I perceive as really sexist language and sexist banter
B	mm mm
A	from these guys but yeah it was a really generational thing and there's still absolutely no excuse for it
B	yeah
A	but
B	no there isn't
A	my mum used to engage in it and I
B	I you know I can't do it
A	I always feel she was letting the side down sometimes
B	yeah and
A	mm yeah me too
B	erm I don't have a problem and I think
A	and I pull myself up sometimes
B	yeah exactly yeah
A	and when it comes out I'm suggesting that somebody hasn't thrown very well but
B	uhu
A	that's bollocks
B	yeah
A	I had a school record for throwing the rounders ball
B	but yeah things like man up or
A	yeah
B	get some balls all this stuff I just think
A	I say man up but I also say woman up
B	woman up
A	yeah
B	woman up yeah so it's difficult especially when things are just sort of ingrained in language and you can't
A	mm
B	erm
A	yeah
B	it is just sort of such a natural turn of phrase that everyone knows that it you know don't
A	yeah
B	consider it but it is er a bad thing that you shouldn't say you should be saying something else
A	yeah
B	you wet lettuce which is sort of gender neutral
A	yeah
A	that's funny
A	you wet lettuce
A	I like that wet lettuce that's great
B	yes anyway I'm doing
A	damp squib
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A finds wet lettuce disgusting.	Contradiction
B	yeah nice
A	yeah

A	I suppose squid would be quite damp on account of the
B	yeah
A	yeah
A	we are and it's right wintery round here
B	fifteen minutes
[ANNOTATION]	It smells like spring's coming.	Contradiction
A	I can feel from the sheer volume of buildings creeping up around us bit by bit that we're gonna be in
B	yeah well I've texted and said I reckon quarter past
A	mm
B	might be longer than that now but
A	yeah erm
A	Simon sat nav says twelve minutes past but he doesn't really know how slowly we've been crawling along
A	yeah perfect
A	someone's built an outdoor display of colourful football-shaped beanbags
A	plonked in the snow that's very strange
B	ah
[ANNOTATION]	Someone made a display of the solar system.	Contradiction
A	ah
B	I don't have anything else to say I just thought
A	we're great entertainment value aren't we?
B	we'd make a just if we make noises then we're it's not silent
B	oh yes so
A	isn't that curious? how people often like to fill a silence
B	I do yeah I usually hum
A	yeah
B	even if it's just like me and another person
A	that was I found a great weapon for business meetings
[ANNOTATION]	People try to maintain silence as much as possible.	Contradiction
B	what? accepting silence?
A	yeah and I'm I think quite good at accepting silence and
B	mm
A	people get themselves into all sorts of verbal difficulties
B	mm
A	through their discomfort
B	yeah and it's a good thing to do for
A	mm yes
B	you've just gotta sit in silence and wait sometimes
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A believes silence doesn't help at all.	Contradiction
A	yep
B	even if it's awful and you want to
A	thump them?
B	say something
A	oh
B	no you just wanna I just wanna speak erm
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B wants to say something.	Entailment
A	shake your teenagers gently by the throat and make them communicate with you?
B	yeah er sometimes just waiting it out will do no matter how painful it is
A	yeah
B	so
A	I think by Polish terms it's relatively sizeable larger than
A	erm but
B	yeah it's a good sort of
B	yeah central spot
A	not sure what the speed limit is loads of vehicles behind me and none in front of me
A	so I'll just pull over here there we are jolly good
B	oh traffic going the other way I wonder where they're all going
A	I think it seems to be erm quite similar though I think they've got traffic lights going the other way
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	I gave it you back
A	oh did you? oh so you did thank you
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	peace?
