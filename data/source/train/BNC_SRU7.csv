A	it's like an old an old tape recorder so
C	there's something rather comforting about that isn't it?
C	oh it's going round
A	yes
C	that means it's yes recording
A	press record I'm still in the old-school way of doing things
C	right so the green light means it's recording?
A	well it's going round so that always used to mean
C	yeah
A	it's recording
C	right
A	oh I don't know
C	yeah
A	I can't remember but er
C	well
A	gosh those were the days everything physical none of this digital crap erm yeah stomach enzymes what were we saying?
C	no you were you were saying that
A	oh it's very interesting anyway yeah er that you do have some control over it and I know for fact that well
C	yes
A	your body there there definitely is
C	in everything that you've read though does your as you get older does your body change?
A	uhu
C	because something I've noticed I I've suddenly erm I'm definitely getting middle-aged spread
A	well there's reasons for that and
C	well it's my age I should imagine is one of them
A	yeah but there's also some control over that as well depending on and I can't remember I've just read the
C	what there are certain foods you can eat?
A	yeah there's all that erm but the worst culprits to simplify it the culprits are sugar alcohol glucose erm probably dairy but I don't think dairy's as bad erm cheese is quite bad but er yeah sugar and alcohol
C	but that's natural sugars as well you're talking about?
A	and natural sugars so erm although not nearly as bad but if you were to eat a piece of fruit you've got all the fibre and all the good things as well so that in context is still good
C	mm
A	but if you also mix it with a lunch that has other things that aren't sweet or you can put it in with a savoury thing as well then it doesn't have the bad blood sugar effect
C	right
A	erm but I know for a fact and how I know for a fact that it has a bearing on one's body what one eats is I get these flabby earlobes I've got flabby earlobe syndrome
C	really?
A	really lumpy yes
C	god I've never heard of that
A	yeah that's a fatty thing it's a fatty inflammation thing
C	well I've got pierced ears though so maybe would
A	no
C	the same thing happen?
A	no you've got I you've got different earlobes to me so probably not
C	so I wouldn't tend to get the syndrome anyway even if
A	no it's not a syndrome
C	it it might
A	I've just made up the syndrome
A	but I just know that I get flabby earlobes and that's to do with sort of inflammation and deposits of crap and
C	well I tell what I've noticed I've noticed I'm getting a layer of fat on the back of my neck
A	well yes it crops up in many strange places yeah
C	which I never used to have I caught sight of myself in a changing room mirror you know when
A	mm
C	you can see the back of yourself and I suddenly thought
A	and suddenly the back of you
C	I never used to look like that
A	yeah
C	I've just this kind of extra layer of fat round there
A	no it it comes in really strange places and that's to do with your eating as well because it will kind of store things but if you eat it the right way it won't store things erm
C	mm
A	so there's a very straightforward er scientific thing you can do in around how you eat but the first thing is glucose and sugar and alcohol it really is
C	I've always I've always gone before on how I feel rather than how I look
A	mm
C	so
A	looks are quite a good barometer though I find
C	yeah I mean the fact okay like the an extra layer of fat on the back of my neck er I don't I don't it doesn't I don't feel bad about it other than when I see it
A	it doesn't it yeah it yeah
C	and then I go oh that's not very nice
A	it doesn't hurt I mean getting erm thing these things
C	oh batwings
A	batwings
C	yes
A	that doesn't hurt it's not painful but it's just bloody what the fuck?
C	yes
C	oh yeah no it's
A	because I didn't no I noticed that in my thirties that everything was going a little bit
C	going south
A	well just not as er taut and firm as it was so I started exercising straightaway and it sorted it out the only problem is you do have to work you have to keep working hard at it
C	yeah
A	but that's the only way
C	well have you erm
A	to keep it at bay
C	have you ever read interviews with oh god who's this Gillian Lynne? she's a a choreographer but she was a dancer she's now god in er well into her eighties
A	uhu
C	erm and she's still dancing she has this
A	yeah
C	regime she gets up every morning
A	yeah
C	and she's had two hip replacement operations as well
A	mm
C	but she still does it all
A	mm
C	she's absolutely incredible but she says the thing is it gets harder every day
A	yeah
C	it gets harder so it requires more effort
A	well your body has changed you I think you have to accept that your body's not the same as it was when you were twenty it starts to change in the thirties but it's radically changed by the time you're reached sort of over fifties it really has so you have to adapt and and change your your whole everything really
C	but it seems to to maintain
A	work harder
C	work harder
A	yeah
C	and that that just
A	yeah
C	as each
A	yeah
C	each year goes by
A	but
C	which is kind of there must come a point where you got I just
A	no
C	I can't
A	not quite because if you do the right sort of exercise you don't have to exert yourself too much it only takes ten minutes a day to keep it all together really
C	what are you talking about aerobic exercise or?
A	yeah yeah or weights are really important cos that kind of makes everything come together again
C	yeah cos everything just bounces about and it
A	and it's just like yeah
C	and you can feel it tugging at your
A	yeah no no don't
C	your your everything bouncing and tugging
A	don't do it it's
C	yeah
A	just it's the worst
C	yeah
A	it's it has to be gentle and no no big er sort of erm bumps or anything like that
C	no jerky yeah
A	no jerky stuff
C	that's why erm
A	just really gentle
C	that's why I love yoga I absolutely adore yoga
A	yeah
C	because also it it makes me feel so because it's all you kind of
A	yeah
C	go inside yourself and
A	well it opens up all the energy blocked energy things and then everything starts flowing energetically nicely between the body and that's what you ultimately really so that's lovely I don't think though yoga's enough or in itself cos you need just a little bit of sort of resistance and
C	mm
A	erm er
C	to really make make
A	a tiny bit
C	well something that's making the muscles work hard so that they're
A	because they're losing something they're
C	yeah
A	and that is also the reason why people shrink when they get older as well so
C	yeah that's right
A	density
C	yes
A	goes
C	yeah
A	less and it's all to do with the hormones and everything erm so that that's changed fact that won't you can't change the fact that the body has changed but if you erm do certain sorts of exercises you can kind of slow down the process
C	mm
A	and feel better really erm so
C	is there any more tea in the pot?
A	yeah and I'll get some milk
C	I'm gonna put the tea in first I I erm
A	okay you're a tea first girl
C	oh
A	yes true
C	if you've already put the milk in there's no going back is there?
A	yeah
C	sorry do you want some more? or
A	yeah I've got plenty
C	I'll let you do your own
A	do you want to do it yourself?
C	yeah I'll do it myself yes it's
A	yeah
C	bit easier
A	but oh I'm absolutely certain that we have some control over it but yeah simple things er which I haven't done in the last few days like I say cos I need to do a whole new shop for vegetables but er sugar alcohol gluten they're the worst but you don't have to come off them completely but just cut down
C	mm
A	right
C	no I guess I should have one one last bash at erm before it all fully falls apart
A	I don't think it needs to fall apart
C	it's quite erm it requires er a lot of erm headspace to concentrate on it you know?
A	it does what er to concentrate on not falling apart?
C	yes
A	yes it does it's a whole area of study
C	yeah and there's other things
A	yeah
C	I I
A	but those other things you need a body for and I think it's important to give it head space cos those other things are dependent on your body
C	yes oh no that is true and it's all linked isn't it? and with your mind and everything else no you are right really
A	so the body is ultimate
A	it was going there
A	yeah
C	my body is a temple
A	so it it all comes through your body all the creativity so without that and if you get ill and stuff
C	so therefore it's all going to yeah
A	yeah it's not it there's it's not as straightforward as that
C	yes I've got a sinking feeling you're probably right and I'm just saying that
A	well it's easier to but I mean how great to know that you do have some control over it
C	well you have a choice if you if you're
A	you've got a choice
C	if you're prepared to put the time and the energy in
A	mm
C	you you can
A	yeah
C	to a certain extent erm
A	uhu it is to an extent but you can actually feel better
C	mm
A	but I'm only doing it because I haven't finished with the music and I I'm such a late starter that by the time I get some money I want to enjoy it
C	yes yeah
A	and all that that's
C	yeah
A	the only reason I'm not prepared to just let it all
C	yeah it's difficult
A	go yet
C	what I'm finding difficult is erm
A	well yeah
C	yeah not
A	sitting
C	not moving around
A	mm
C	erm and if if it's going well the writing's going well I actually hours will go and I'll forget to move
A	yes
C	whereas erm
A	yeah you should move you should
C	I know
A	remember to move
C	I know
A	just a little break and and a home workout that's all it takes
C	you erm what do you think about this fashion now for er
A	I don't know that sounds quite
C	yeah there are special desks
A	interesting
C	you don't stand the whole time but erm you stand for some of the time and so it's a desk that will convert from a a sit-down desk to a
A	yeah
C	it'll just raise up and you
A	yeah I like the sound of that
C	you stand for a bit yeah
A	yeah
C	they reckon it's cos we evidently we're not designed to actually erm
A	no we're not no
C	sit down for long periods of time
A	yeah
C	our backs aren't designed for it
A	oh but I mean
C	and our internal organs get all squashed and
A	bit yes yeah it's er it's not right we're meant to do different things
C	well I suppose we are actually supposed to be erm active aren't we? if we were hunter gatherers we would be active all the time
A	mm we'd be doing various different things I think er er on a physical level yeah
C	so erm maybe I need to need like some pedals under my desk and you could
A	how's your erm that hormone thing?
C	HRT?
A	yeah you don't have to talk about it if you don't want to
C	no no cos I no I mean the it's funny
A	it's only going down for posterity
C	no I was I was just thinking actually that erm er so I'm on my third month now and it it actually I feel like I've been asleep it's waking me up
A	oh that's so interesting so you're on actual hormone replacement therapy then?
C	yes
A	the hormone replacement therapy?
C	yes very low
A	gosh
C	they'll be the lowest level you can be on cos it's
A	because all your symptoms according to the book I've been reading
C	mm
A	have come up in that book
C	yeah
A	and and all the emotional thing as well came up as well
C	mm
A	and I thought god that's just exactly what
C	well it's gone away
A	and er
C	now all those symptoms
A	yeah
C	I don't the hot flushes anymore I don't have
A	no
C	the horrible
A	yeah
C	and the kind of panic attacks
A	this is the
C	I'm not so tired anymore
A	that's cortisol something like that
C	yeah it's cos it's actually was
A	the hormones going haywire
C	yeah it sends a message to
A	to panic
C	pituitary gland
A	yeah
C	yeah? which sends messages to your brain
A	yeah
C	and it's it produces adrenalin and so it was
A	yeah
C	it was all just going completely
A	cos the book is saying that you can sort of balance it all out anyway
C	with with diet
A	with diet
C	yes people have said that to me
A	I mean it's probably the same function that erm you know maybe er a broccoli would do
C	yeah
A	would do the
C	yeah cos I tried all the er the remedies you can buy yourself
A	yes yeah
C	you know like the evening primrose oil
A	I I think that you have to be very extreme about it to do the erm
C	also I should imagine
A	really do it
C	it would take a lot of trial and error cos you'd have to keep trying things wouldn't you to see what made a difference
A	well my diet is really extreme when I do the it's like whole thing put it in the bloody Nutribullet
C	mm
A	no namby-pamby oh it tastes horrible oh
C	yeah
A	I'm not having that no none of that just get it down you sort of thing erm
C	but no I I feel like I've erm got my sanity back not that I was
A	mm
C	going completely mad but it's only now I'm kind of I feel like I'm coming out of a fog and I'm going
A	well it would make you feel like that
C	and
A	yeah
C	and that's also why I'm now looking at myself and going mm my body's changed hasn't it? and I think I wasn't really noticing before
A	and the thing you can only now look at yourself and go mm my body's changed sensibly look at yourself and go like that because you've had the
C	yeah
A	thing so that's really good
C	but I think the er what's what I find really interesting is I didn't it's only now that I realised how much it was affecting me
A	yes
C	the whole menopause
A	yeah
C	thing erm which actually is quite worrying cos you think how many I could have gone on for years because
A	yes
C	a lot of people er sort of just dismiss it and go
A	that's the way it's yeah
C	it's not you know and and you do you I not not that I was suicidal or anything but I've definitely
A	well you could get that way
C	wasn't wasn't firing on all cylinders
A	no
C	and that's a real shame and you wonder how many people erm
A	just putting up with it and
C	yeah they just
A	yeah
C	they cos you sort of
[ANNOTATION]	You wonder how many people think that way	Neutral
A	suffering
C	you don't really become aware because I think it creeps up on you as well
[ANNOTATION]	You are not aware of it because it's creepy	Entailment
A	uhu
C	and it happens gradually
A	yeah
C	er because I as I say this is on my third month and I'm noticing the it wasn't like instant you know within within er two days it's like a felt like a different
A	yes
C	and adjust to it
A	mm
C	and it's really just been this third month I'm suddenly going yeah this is god this is
A	what a relief
C	erm
A	yes
C	yeah so
A	that's amazing
C	yeah
A	you're creating your life through those filters
C	well you yeah you structure your yeah
[ANNOTATION]	You are creating your life through some filters	Entailment
A	your decisions everything you do
C	yeah
A	you might be feeling unconfident and so don't do the little that would make
C	mm
[ANNOTATION]	You may feel not that confident	Entailment
A	that it's I mean it's unfair as well it's and and people with depression and mental illness and stuff that
C	I felt I felt quite erm angry about it actually when I realised because I thought this is such a dirty trick
A	yes it is isn't it?
C	and why is it that they do it to women?
A	yes it is
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker C felt angry because human rights are not respected	Neutral
C	you know
A	well I mean historically it would seem that
C	I say they
C	somebody er it's just an accident of nature I suppose
A	or god
C	yeah but but you know
A	god's a bastard
C	erm
A	but erm
C	but you for for a woman particularly if if she's had children you've just you're just getting through all that and
A	yeah
C	and your children are grown up and you think oh I'm getting my life back again and then that happens
A	well it's no wonder that there's more men who are I know it's changing but it's no wonder it's a man's world really
C	oh it's so much simpler for men
A	yeah
C	it really is so much simpler
A	I mean how can you go through life with all those emotions and sort of?
C	well all this stuff you have to handle
A	it's just stuff
C	all the time yeah
A	yeah
C	it's erm
A	so it's really unfair yeah erm
C	yeah
A	but I then I think I think depression is also really unfair and all that and stuff mental
C	yes
A	shit
C	and that can that can affect
A	no but a sense of it
C	but that kind of idea of it being a chemical imbalance in your brain
A	oh yes
C	and it actually is out of your control
A	yes
C	you kind of go this is crazy why am I
A	well
C	doing this?
A	it's out of your control and yet there's that kind of terrible thing of that fine line of some of it is in your control and er
C	but er if you
A	but that's also not fair
C	yeah but you get the sort of sense of watching yourself
A	mm
C	and and I became terribly aware of
A	yes and
C	mm
A	it's extra effort to stop doing it because you can see what you're doing and
C	yeah I suppose it's yes you
A	but erm
C	you break the cycle of then
A	and then
C	then you the yeah the fog
A	mm
C	and you can see things as they really are
A	yeah
C	and then you can take control again but it
A	yeah
C	it's when you're in the middle of the er
A	yeah it is a fog and not seeing the wood for the trees
C	but erm
A	but erm interesting because it makes you think about our mother and she she probably menopausal for years and wouldn't even have
C	no the
A	said a word
C	also at that time it probably wasn't so
A	yeah
C	recognised it was
A	so that's
C	I mean it's interesting to well I talk to to female friends about it and some of them are kind of very staunch like no no I'm not going to take er I'm going to do it naturally I'm you know I I can sort this out erm and as you say everyone's different and perhaps some people can and for a long time
A	I think so yeah
C	I I but I almost dismissed it in the same way that other people do it's like well it's
A	mm
C	erm
A	yes
C	really seeing things as clearly as they could because they are right in the middle of it
A	yeah I mean
C	but you say you're you're managing to keep a lot of things under control with your diet?
A	oh well I have to er I have to do that and I have to do exercise every day otherwise I get really stiff
C	mm
A	is good very only short very short exercise er
C	mm
A	it's erm something I'm used to doing is taking steps to oh god okay yeah I'll feel better if I do a workout let's do a workout
C	yeah yeah
A	I'll shift my body and do it and then
C	mm
A	I do feel better so there's that fine line of
C	yeah hello mm what's the time? oh god it's quarter to I've got to erm
A	how much did we manage? we've done twenty minutes yes
C	is that is that useful twenty minutes?
A	yeah that is I can sell that I can sell twenty minutes
B	home
A	hello
C	I'm here
C	it's not just my coat it's me
A	mm what are we going to eat? hello
B	well is is the salmon on have you? so that's
A	oh
B	all cooked now
A	well we hadn't established that that was what I was going to do
C	hello
B	hi
C	how are you?
B	good
C	mm
B	are you recording yourself?
C	yes
A	yes
B	am I being recorded?
A	you are now
B	that's not rolling
A	it is rolling
B	oh
C	actually if you want to carry on recording I can I've just got to look at erm an er an attachment someone's sent me so I'll bring my my laptop down here and do it down here
A	yes
C	then erm carry on
A	yes that's a good idea
C	if that's if it's okay
A	no that's fine cos that's natural
B	tired
A	we could do a macaroni cheese but without bacon
B	or cheese
A	we've got a little bit of cheese
B	not a lot well when what time is
A	not till much later
B	so we don't have to feed him?
A	no
B	okay
A	I'll do like a macaroni
B	have you got milk dear?
A	well
B	we don't have macaroni
A	we've got loads and we've got
B	well
A	loads of pasta shells
B	we'll do that then
A	okay I'll do that
A	erm
A	after our conversation on gluten and dairy I'm going to do macaroni cheese cos that's what we have
B	but don't address the
A	sorry?
B	don't address the recorder
A	no I'm addressing
B	oh
B	sorry darling
B	I thought you were being Nabokovian
A	no
B	like that
A	not Nabakovian but I was then cos that's an interesting word
B	well do you want a drink
C	no I'm I've just had a cup of tea thank you
B	small glass of beer?
C	no I'm fine thank you cos we've been talking about
A	and on that on that
C	yes
C	cos oh I I need a glass of wine now
A	yeah
C	that was all a bit yeah
B	I will get my mufti on darling
C	no I couldn't quite
B	it is midweek
A	sorry?
C	only drink at weekends
A	ah er
A	I know
A	yes
C	having said that
A	yes
C	so that's not very good
A	no it's fine
A	can I use some of your butter?
A	right
A	how's
C	they're good they're they're having to hold the fort this weekend cos both
A	oh right
C	so it's just erm
A	wow
C	and
A	gosh
C	I know
A	that's good
C	in theory in theory it should be fine but it's the first time we've actually
A	that's really good
C	done that so
A	though cos they can just start
C	yeah I mean they both they both can look after themselves but they've never been in sort of in charge of the house as well
A	yeah
C	and the animals and er
A	that's really useful if you can just
C	yeah but we had to shut the house up today cos they're not they don't get back from
A	yeah
C	all shut up
A	gosh it must be such a relief when you get them to that stage like that
C	it yeah it is erm
A	and they're not they haven't proved themselves to be mm
C	well yeah I mean if you
A	and I would always be worried that
C	yeah if you feel like they've actually made it to adulthood
A	yeah that's right
C	without any major mishaps you think
A	yeah
C	but then but then the there's different things to you have to think about because now
A	yes
C	and erm
A	so
C	we had to go out somewhere the other day and he was driving and and he's picked up so many bad habits already
A	oh
C	I'm thinking god he's gonna have an accident
A	yes
C	so you know then so it's all very well being independent but then there's other things you have to start thinking about
A	a whole new set of worries
C	yeah
A	well I'm glad I'll never have that
B	hello
C	but you're just worried about Mr T instead
A	yeah
C	I think
A	it's probably not as intense as a human
C	well no I think you maybe it because I I remember with our dog
C	we had
A	yeah
C	and everything but I I don't get like that now about the dogs
A	yeah
C	kind of er
A	but at least well I don't know I
C	oh yeah?
A	the
C	have they have they taken it over full time now?
A	yes yeah
B	yeah they've taken over the
A	I suspect that they're going to have children though they're like a couple
B	they have a
A	no the people we made friends with
C	don't you put that on first after and then start the white sauce?
A	no you do the white sauce first
B	no you do not
A	yes you do
B	oh strange symmetry to my day I got almost all the way to
B	so
C	didn't you notice when you were walking along?
B	no
B	realised that I could barely it was a blur so I I
C	oh no
B	so I had to go all the way back to the pub to collect my bag
C	oh god
B	which was still where it was
C	so you're
B	that's a neat symmetry isn't it?
C	yes top and tailed your day
B	yeah
C	with er forgetfulness
B	with with tracking back
C	yes so erm does this happen often?
B	I think I have erm cos my friend said she didn't think I'd drunk that much and I hadn't I had like two pints er enough to forget my bag but I think I just had muscle memory of cos it felt
C	yeah
B	when I put my coat on it felt like I had
C	mm
B	and I had my book er which is the only thing in my bag so anyway I didn't feel the strap going across my chest
C	yeah
B	in in in the tube and I thought oh hang on oh damn
C	that's such such a pain isn't it?
B	mm but I haven't forgotten to wear my spectacles for erm
C	but you cos you wear you wear glasses all the time
B	yeah
C	so how can if you?
B	in the old days I could if I got as far as I got I'd go oh well I'll get by but now
C	no
B	I wouldn't be able to I'd be a Mr Magoo
C	or a magnifying glass
B	at work
C	to read
B	yeah
C	things I've I've got to go and make a quick work call
A	yeah
C	I will return
A	okay
B	I was just relating it to your sister darling
A	yes
B	it was almost Nabokovian
A	oh it was Nabokovian was it?
B	well in a sense because there seemed to be some sort of hidden meaning
A	what is Nabokovian?
B	well it's all about things that I read in his biography
A	are you looking for the er
B	I've got these though
A	it might be no
A	yeah
B	so there you go my dear
A	well I think we should take this opportunity
B	she's away for the next fortnight in the Caribbean
A	uhu well we've got people in the house who are quite
B	turn that on
A	people in the house for
B	might be too early for that
A	why? I always do this first
B	I wouldn't do that until the pasta was virtually almost cooked
A	no but you've got to heat out the flour
B	cook out the flour
A	exactly
B	erm
A	what about
B	let me think
A	so it's cheese and pasta
B	well spinach would be nice wouldn't it?
A	mm
B	spinach with cheese is
A	er we've actually got real spinach
B	erm
A	is that all?
B	broad beans?
A	no
B	spinach
A	no
B	Quorn mince
A	we're lacking the erm bacon really aren't we?
B	sausages would be alright but I think they're still frozen
A	with sausages? nothing here what's in the bottom there?
B	so my idea of spinach is the best one
A	yeah it is the best one well what do you want shall we put I dunno it would go all greeny wouldn't it?
B	mm be like the sort of dish we used to have in the old days
A	yes
B	when we were vegetarian
A	I think it we should have something else apart from this carbohydrate fest
B	well we're not
A	so we're having spinach
B	politics
A	about hormone replacement therapy
B	oh gosh
B	tell me about it
C	but not literally
A	er no but I think that we should have spinach
B	oh well do you want spinach or grated cheese
A	both darling
B	well I can't do both can I?
A	well you can choose to do one and then do the other
B	no you do everything
A	okay
B	no I just said you do everything no that cheese is supposed to be my lunchtime
A	oh sorry darling
B	actually no my idea with
A	somewhere quiet
B	well
A	ish well not if you're
B	couldn't couldn't guarantee that city restaurant
A	yeah I've transcribed
B	worse
A	some horrendous ones
B	yeah you did sleep quite well actually
A	no I didn't and so therefore
B	I was there too
A	I didn't get up till much too late so
A	I might have to stay up tonight
B	forgot to watch it last night that
A	oh darling did you see what I sent you in the email?
B	no
A	there's a house that's sold on
B	oh you're like my mum
A	on
A	for four hundred thousand pounds one of the smaller ones
B	fucking hell you're like my mum
A	yeah four hundred
B	have you rung my mum to say?
A	thousand
B	mind you they have more bedrooms don't they?
A	what the smaller houses?
B	well I think so like
A	no but it means that this is at least four fifty
B	the same price what did you say it went for?
A	the same price? no it's much bigger
B	mm
A	four hundred thousand
B	no that's my point is that it's not more bedroomy but
A	I
B	I should ring my mum and tell her
A	they'll just say that
B	which house was it darling?
A	no they called that five bedrooms
B	yeah
A	so I suggest we wait till we can sell it for about five and six
B	and move to
A	six hundred thousand
B	where would I work in
A	and then we buy with the change we buy a a house in
A	and we pay off the mortgage as well with this one and then we rent out this one
B	er?
A	so we keep
B	that doesn't work
A	keep our investment
B	cos we no your logic was we've already sold it
A	oh sorry
B	to buy the house in
A	oh yes
B	otherwise it's a brilliant idea
B	yeah
A	oh damn it
B	not in negative equity so
B	it's still good
A	but I thought I'd like to keep it as a cos it to keep a house in
B	did you see how much of the recycling I managed to put out
A	er yeah it's good
B	that was your job do you remember?
A	yes
B	I thought you probably wouldn't so I did it
A	but then I did the whole house today
B	yeah
A	and I oh the sheets are on the line outside
B	really?
A	what shall I do?
B	well bring them in cos there's nothing over the bannisters
A	okay do it after this cos that as well to try to create the space so I think we've now caught up with our washing
B	oh that's impressive
A	yeah
B	cos normally I do everything I'm not wearing shoes though
A	do you er put the?
B	oh did I get a package?
A	no
A	we could leave them out there what would happen if we left them out there overnight?
B	it might rain and that would negate the whole
A	no but it wouldn't do any harm and they'd be out of the way
B	it would do a little bit of harm
A	and if it doesn't rain
B	they don't need to be out of the way because the bannister's free for them to go over that
A	okay that's still a bit in the way though isn't it?
B	you go and collect them darling
A	I'm using up all
B	yeah
A	as well
B	did you contact our new friends at all?
A	well you you keep saying that what do you want me to do?
B	be friendly?
A	I I have I've done it
B	no you just reciprocated the initial
A	well
B	friendliness
A	well what else can I do?
B	er
B	I'm not going to do it am I? I'm not friendly
A	but I I don't know what you want
B	suggest we meet up
A	well okay tell me when you want to meet
B	for a drink or do you want that in there?
A	yeah
B	or just bash it
A	well
B	the
A	okay let's put the pasta on I think
B	I'm doing this now
A	how were we gonna do the spinach? put it in here? no that's too watery really we need to cook the spinach as well
A	shall we put it actually in a dish when it's all done?
B	yeah
A	put it in a big dish then put it in the oven
B	do the spinach in a separate dish and then drain it
A	mm
B	of water
A	okay could you erm sort out the spinach please?
B	oh no cos you said
B	that I had
B	to do
A	go on
B	the cheese
B	the cheese
A	you've done it go on
B	but then I have ended up doing everything
A	you haven't
A	the cheese is okay
B	no I've turned it down it's fine
A	where's all the salt gone?
B	probably too much actually
A	it isn't
B	no just play it by sight
A	but anyway that's good though isn't it? four hundred thousand
B	is the kettle on? which house was it? cos my mum ought to know
A	well I'll show you
B	like Zoopla what went for what?
A	yeah no more like houses in this road went for whatever
B	that's what I meant yeah
A	yeah
B	in fact I think that's exactly what I said
A	it's not exactly what you said
B	well it pretty much is
A	you said pretty much that but I was just establishing it
B	is he coming in?
A	so I think
B	not coming in
A	ours is worth at least four hundred and fifty thousand
B	good girl
A	yes
B	funny typing this cos you'll find that I'm often quite right about things and also that you often repeat what I've said moments later as your own idea
A	yeah I know that anyway but it's because it is my own idea moments later
B	mm
A	so it's got a logic
B	do you want that in there?
A	want what in where?
B	the onion
A	yeah
B	there you go my dear
A	thank you not too much clattering
B	flatulence?
A	not too much clattering
B	oh
A	how's
B	come back in in the morning
A	no I didn't
B	you were fast asleep
A	didn't those flowers do well? I want another set bunch
B	probably
A	I said thought we've sold it and then we've rented it out
B	and then we've also have the money sold it
B	for four hundred half a million
A	okay
B	and still have the money
A	so erm
B	well my scenario which I told
A	well we could buy outright if we sold this place we could buy outright in
B	so now we're discussing options when neither of us actually die?
A	when neither of us actually die
B	oh okay
A	so if we were to sell this place we could pay off the mortgage and
A	buy a place shh and buy a place in
B	I don't know why you're so fond of
A	cos it's nice
B	we've only been there like thrice
A	well so? and then never been on
A	erm and then if you inherit
A	then we could buy another house in
B	oh gosh
A	and rent it out and have an income that way
B	portfolio
A	yeah
B	like
A	no but the thing to do is get you like off from this kind of nine to five working thing cos it's a bit crap so we have to find a way to not have to do that anymore
B	well he'd have almost a million in er
A	yeah
B	in fact he'd have a million
A	yeah so he he could go back to
B	he'd be a millionaire
A	yeah he could go anywhere and we could meanwhile sell
B	or move there
A	no we couldn't afford to move there though
B	oh
A	can't can't pay the erm although could we? can we pay no
B	oh that that's a deal breaker
A	that's that a deal breaker
B	mm poor boy
A	yes
B	yes he has he had his breakfast at three thirty again
A	oh he's a bit naughty
B	it's worth having two late midnight snacks
A	yes
B	he does no he wakes me with such a start that
A	you're so shocked
B	that I
A	that you do it
B	get up
A	yes
B	I mean cos I'm wide awake
A	he takes you unawares
B	whereas you probably are able to just roll over and get back to sleep
A	right it's time for pasta
B	yeah well you probably want me to do that as well which would have meant
A	oh would you? that would be good
B	I think I've done the whole meal it's like that
A	no we're doing it together
B	it's like that folk tale with the
A	there you go
B	and it turns out that apart from doing the white sauce
A	I've done that for you
B	I've made the entire meal
A	have you noticed how clean and tidy the house is though?
B	yes
A	thank you
B	did you boil the kettle?
A	I thought I did don't know
B	yeah no you did
A	erm
B	I would suggest it's slightly more left wing
A	I would suggest that people are mainly left wing
B	yeah
A	er
B	younger people are and most of the
A	because that's morally more right
A	just odd that we have not that in a government
B	it's like the awful business of Cameron saying a bunch of migrants
A	yeah exactly
B	and it's so so clever because he knew it was outrageous
A	he knew it would appeal?
B	no it's that he knew it was outrageous so it would be newsworthy but within the actual context it's not as outrageous as it sounds out of context but er crucially out of the entire parliamentary question time er that would be the soundbite
A	yeah
B	that's played on the news
A	and?
B	so you never have to hear anything about what Jeremy Corbyn has to say
A	clever
B	what you hear is the point
A	yes
B	he's trying to make which people will then thing is clumsily made I E clumsy not deliberate tripping over his words or whatever but actually all they hear is
A	yeah
B	it's er quite devious but that's what politics is like
A	extremely
B	and it's where Jeremy Corbyn unfortunately
A	is gonna fall down
B	falls down
A	yes cos he's not
B	as sort of not particularly
A	playing that game
B	noted backbencher
A	and he cannot play that game because it would be against his whole person to play that game and the whole point of him is to not play that game if you like but it can't work in a playing field where everybody's playing that game
A	shame
B	are you doing that pasta dear or the?
A	this pasta
B	oh
A	this is why you say
B	don't put it in yet
A	when your workplace has become oh it's very political that's what it means
B	well we ought to contact her
A	yeah
B	do you know what
A	towards what?
B	er when she's here or not here and when
A	no I do not know all I know is that
B	are they working that weekend?
A	what weekend?
B	next weekend not this coming one the one after
A	dunno have to ask I don't know all I know is
B	hopefully he's bringing me a crate of
A	I think he will
B	of wine
A	I think he will
B	you'll have to pay for it dear
A	I can't I'm absolutely nothing nothing nothing nothing
B	well after I've done this whole meal
A	this is the last of our food

A	yes
B	oh that'll be fun
A	I'm coming and I'm going to help as well
B	right yeah
A	yeah but I mean I'll go earlier if you want
B	well actually I intend to go late

A	flash that around er
B	they own a copy
A	yes
B	uhu
A	uhu
B	wait for it to boil looks nice though is it salted? did I ask that?
A	yes you asked that I think it will
B	do you want to taste? yeah I was going to say taste it because spinach needs quite a lot of salt
A	mm
B	mm
A	wow that's beautiful
B	mm good girl
A	where's all the salt gone?
B	finished
A	is there no salt then? it's no use using this is there? going to have to
B	would you like me to measure out the pasta?
A	yes please shall we?
B	which dish do you want to serve it in?
A	this dish the big one erm this is a bit full
B	what the other dish?
A	yeah and there's three of us and I'm mega-hungry and that's big pasta so they don't actually go very far
B	no that's enough it looks well that's that's certainly enough
A	well not for me
B	that's enough
A	it's only gonna be that much pasta each
B	yeah imagine they double in size
A	they don't double in size
B	pretty much
A	I know this from last time
B	that's probably enough actually so
A	no
B	oh okay
A	that is a lot
B	it's not
A	no less darling
B	just humour me then I'm hungry
