A	how are you guys anyway?
C	yeah good thank you
A	have you been up to much?
C	not really just stressing about my hen do and stuff like that
A	oh
C	and dresses and all that stuff
A	it seems like it's going really though everybody's being like responsive enough
D	yeah it's been like some people have like have been like after we've said like oh
A	yeah
D	you need to let us know but we've got it all booked and that and obviously so
A	that's good so that's exciting
D	so cos I think we just wanted to get the accommodation out of the way and rest of it's like
A	yeah that's the only
D	that can be left a bit
A	time sensitive one really
D	yeah
A	when there's that many people
D	there's so
A	yeah
D	like as early as possible and then cos a lot of places are booked like are getting booked out so
A	yeah that doesn't really surprise me oh thank you
D	that's alright
A	yeah it looks lovely I'm looking forward to it
D	I think it's quite reasonable I know it's like still quite pricey but it's quite good for the amount of time
A	I think it's really reasonable yeah
D	yeah
A	for like four days is it? it's four days it it?
C	yeah three nights
A	I think that's great
C	yeah and it's a really nice place
A	yeah
C	anyway I think she'll really like it cos
A	yeah
D	and we
C	but like she was looking at really shitty places and like
C	and like they weren't even for the right amount of people and we're like no we're like they haven't got a hot tub
A	yeah
C	things like that so so I think we've been a bit snobby but I think we've got a really good deal for what we've got
A	I think you yeah I think you guys have found a right little gem there to be honest
C	but like originally they were like erm it said on the web one of the websites we looked at cos they were like through a bigger website if you know what I mean and
A	yeah
C	and then they had their own independent website so I emailed both basically and they're erm one of them said they don't take hen dos so I was sort of like I'll enquire blah blah blah and then like I enquired to the main website which is
A	yeah
C	just theirs and erm the people on the big website they're like oh they don't there's no exceptions so I was like oh shit er but I got that after I'd received emails from the other saying like we treat every
D	yeah case
C	er enquiry
A	yeah
C	differently so I was like
A	well yeah cos you can probably get a good feel for people like
C	yeah
A	what kind of hen do it's gonna be can't you?
C	yeah yeah exactly so I was just like erm trying to speak really properly
C	and I did my
A	nice
C	my professional
A	yeah
C	I was like fuck
C	but I got a confirmation after still
A	well
C	hopefully it's
A	that's exciting
C	the right
A	did everyone did you get money off everybody
C	yeah
A	that you needed to in the end? good
C	yeah got the money
A	yeah
C	but like some people were a bit funny I was like for god's sake
A	cheque that's old school
C	yeah
D	yeah it did didn't it?
[ANNOTATION]	Person D has doubt that does it work or not	Neutral
C	so pretty much got our dresses sorted as well which is good
A	ah that's nice
C	so we're just like just
A	yeah I don't blame you though
[ANNOTATION]	Person A said that he doesnt blame Person c	Entailment
A	just a just a little bit of chocolate then yeah
D	yeah
C	chocolate bar
B	but yeah how have you been anyway?
A	yeah I'm good thank you
C	did you not
B	I'm alright got
C	okay
[ANNOTATION]	Person C accepted what Person A and person B saying	Neutral
B	in a circle
A	not got a huge amount to report to be honest
B	yeah
A	it's been quite quiet I went for dinner last night with
B	oh I've got twelve pound fifty for you
A	oh splendid
B	you
A	yeah
B	oh right
A	so we went to
B	how is
[ANNOTATION]	Person B is asking about the plan that they have	Entailment
A	he seems pretty sound he didn't seem very happy about erm some of the things the girls were saying at my house party
C	what
B	what?
A	he made it was really awkward cos I kind of knew what he was referencing erm but you know when we were all kind of talking about
C	yeah
A	he was kind of sat right there and he made a comment last night about like oh your girls when they get together they can be really bitchy and I was like oh you know er
[ANNOTATION]	Person B said  he made a comment about girls	Entailment
C	what was what was he saying?
A	I think he was actually making more reference to like
C	oh
A	you know how
B	they're not very erm tactile about it they're just like I don't care
A	yeah and
B	well you were there
A	yeah
B	and didn't say anything
A	yeah he just
B	but like the thing is about
A	yeah
B	because like if you went into the ins and outs of it like the reason people are so easily erm the reason people might go oh be be maybe slightly more harsh and more bitchy than they would in any other situation is because they don't really feel like
A	yeah
B	so with that in mind it makes it very difficult for people to do it now it doesn't necessarily you've got to pick your time and your place when you speak about stuff which is maybe
A	yeah
B	which is
A	I did feel really awkward cos like after you guys all left like I could tell
C	really?
A	yeah I thought it was something that I'd done or said or whatever but he was actually sound with me last night so I think he might have just been like getting a bit defensive but like he's a weird I mean I know him and
B	mm
A	like I
B	not being funny does he not remember when she slept with every single one of his friends
A	I know
B	and basically like
A	and then said l
B	screwed with his emotions
A	exactly
B	absolutely and completely and
A	and the thing is
B	fucked him over
A	I feel really funny now about spending time like as like three couples that we do because before
B	yeah
A	I'm not saying she has to go to
B	yeah
A	like but it's just the awkwardness now cos I kind of see her and I'm like I feel like you're being quite fake
C	mm
A	like and
C	yeah
A	but you know when you just feel a bit awkward cos you just know there's so much more to the situation
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	but yeah I dunno I did feel quite bad
B	want some chocolate?
A	I've been giving
B	about what?
C	have you seen much more of her?
A	no I haven't seen anything of her like that's that's what makes it difficult cos I like
C	yeah
A	I know I should feel bad but like
B	I saw her we went to the cinema
A	yeah she did say
B	erm and it and it's fine but I there's always some always it always like feels just that slightly bit awkward like I don't really know why
A	mm
B	like and I'm just not like that I'm not I don't find anything awkward like when someone comes in even if that other person's awkward with them
A	yeah
B	I am so no like that I'm just like get on with it blah blah blah blah blah and the when I was when I was when it gets into it and there's a little bit more I'm fine
A	yeah
B	but initially I feel I'm making complete and utter small talk which is just not what I'm used to doing
A	yeah
B	but then again like I don't think I think that some of that's got to do with like with me like I can't blame that completely on
A	yeah
B	but I just think that she like I think she's just been a bit of a piss poor friend to you
A	but I also can't tell
B	recently
A	I also can't tell how much she's picked up on stuff like do you think she senses that like she needs like to make more effort or do you think
C	I don't think she does
A	she's completely oblivious to it?
B	mm
A	because at
D	did
A	she didn't come to mine no
B	she went to a murder mystery night
D	oh
B	she told us about that
D	why?
A	did she?
B	and me and
B	obviously like we already know about it
A	yeah
B	it was like
B	because I've been on holiday so er who would er how do I know what's so I was like like oh did you all have a nice time
B	obviously I knew I was like
B	no I went to a murder mystery night
A	yeah
B	you know what I mean?
B	cos she knows she was wrong
A	yeah
D	I think it's a bit weird though because like
C	wasn't it raining?
D	obviously you talked about it
C	did you still have your bonfire?
A	yeah
A	yes it did rain and it it's quite
A	it's quite hard to have a barbeque in the rain but we we managed it didn't we?
D	we did manage it yeah
D	well
A	yeah
C	I did
A	yeah
C	that I couldn't come initially
A	yeah
C	like yeah
D	thing like I suppose like cos he spoke about it on the group and stuff but and everyone was like yeah that sounds good
A	yeah
D	but like she didn't even say oh sorry I can't make it or anything
A	no like
D	so like
B	but it's like my birthday
D	we only found out on the night
A	yeah that she wasn't coming
D	that she wasn't coming and
B	it was like my birthday though
A	I know
C	yeah I was gonna say when we were talking about it
A	in the group
C	cos you asked me if I was gonna come
A	yeah
C	in the room
A	yeah and I
C	she didn't say anything
A	she didn't say anything and I also mentioned it on the drive on the way home to erm who did I have in the car?
C	and I said to
A	yeah
C	then we're going out for dinner
A	yeah
C	for his birthday erm and maybe come after it but
A	it was it was more the fact that like when I first mentioned it she said
D	it was quite clear what date it was
A	yeah
B	you said Saturday the
A	Saturday the eighth yeah like two months before
B	I have a real problem with people fucking chatting shits like not in like a way like if you just say I can't come I take it from me like pull up your socks and take it that I'm gonna turn around and go why?
A	yeah
B	why aren't you coming? like tell me why you're not coming like oh you're joking me you're doing this alright then fuck off whatever and be like take it because you're not coming to something that
A	yeah
B	I really want you to come to so you take that on board and just deal with it
A	yeah
B	like I would oh I can't come oh you're being a fucking let down whatever like fair enough I'll take it
A	yeah
B	but don't say you're gonna come and then don't come because by the way that then pisses me off
A	yeah
D	yeah
B	like before
D	oh yeah
B	it doesn't really piss me off I'm just giving you a bit of shit for it
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	cos that's what I'm like
D	yeah
B	but you know what I mean? like you just take and you just like oh I'm sorry I can't come I can't make it like it would have been better if she had said that to you than say
A	yeah
B	she was gonna go and then make up something about oh you thought it was a Friday the eighth had never been a Friday
D	yeah
A	no
B	the
A	and she even she has like
B	do you know what I mean? like
A	like like like you said
B	they would
A	like you said she had so many opportunities to actually tell me in person like oh look it's really awkward I am quite sorry but like I've got other plans but like she purposefully like was really quiet about it and then it wasn't until I said oh you guys are still coming aren't you that she turned round and said no so I'd I'd like to the
D	I find that a bit weird
A	I
C	she must have known though like when we went to
A	yeah she must have known
C	like she had ample opportunity to tell you and if in the beginning when she said oh of course I'll be there
A	yeah
C	it makes you wonder if she's made those plans afterwards?
A	oh she
D	yeah
B	yeah
A	oh I've decided
D	yeah
A	to do this
C	yeah
D	yeah would she have just not turned up?
A	exactly and I'd have been even more pissed off at that but I don't know
B	but at my birthday I was just like
C	does she not feel guilty though for doing that? like
A	don't know she doesn't talk to anyone does she?
C	I'd feel awful
A	so
B	like
C	doesn't she?
B	not really
D	no
B	my birthday I was kind of like
A	yeah
B	cos they said they were gonna come and everyone text me at some point saying oh what time or
A	yeah
B	I didn't have anything
A	to turn up
B	to be coming and then
A	cos that
D	so did she go to
A	she came to
B	she came to
A	but we also went out in
D	yeah we went we
A	yeah yeah you came yeah
D	yeah course we couldn't
A	yeah
A	she was meant to come
B	but like
A	obviously didn't
D	yeah
B	it wouldn't even have bothered me if she'd just popped in
A	and
B	invited to come
D	yeah
A	obviously like I told you she told me a few days before that she wasn't gonna come
B	yeah
A	like I had her and
B	cos then like cos obviously when I said to you I was like oh so
A	yeah
B	that's what you said to me and I was like no
A	yeah
B	because I was just like
D	mm
D	I've not heard from him
B	no
D	since
B	I texted him
D	he was over in the summer
B	did you do you know what I text him?
C	cos we text him not that long ago didn't we?
D	yeah we were like where what the fuck are you
C	what are you doing? like
B	erm
A	yeah
B	do you know what I mean? and I said I
C	what's it's
B	dunno and he put erm and I put I can't believe you haven't text me to be honest erm erm erm er honest
A	maybe she's asking if you're going out
B	erm she didn't bother text me back and then on Thursday the thirtieth of October I texted him again going have I just
D	oh so you don't have time
C	time to text
B	I just don't know where the
C	that's ridiculous
B	I just don't know
A	I know it takes two minutes doesn't it?
B	just don't know where the time is going but I promise I will make it up to you when I'm free
D	oh my
C	what?
D	god
B	so I'm just gonna text him
A	mm
B	and I'll tell him to fuck off because he does this
D	yeah
B	every single time
D	if he does it to us
B	and he said he'd never do it again
C	yeah
B	because
D	well we won't be cos like we never hear from him unless he's single and upset or
B	wants to talk to us about the fucking jewellery
C	but we've texted him a couple of
B	that his
D	yeah
B	girlfriend wears or the jewellery
B	he wants his girlfriend to wear
[ANNOTATION]	the man they are talking about is currently single	Contradiction
D	should be wearing
C	we've text him a couple of times since he's been with
D	and
B	are they still together
D	what sort of stuff?
B	or
D	I don't I dunno
C	don't know who the fuck she is
B	but apparently she's Lithuanian or something
[ANNOTATION]	speaker c hasn't tried to contact him	Contradiction
D	yeah
B	which doesn't really surprise me
D	but like that an excuse to say that you've been busy so you can't text it's just fucking ridiculous
B	but you can't text me on the night of my birthday so
D	or even in all that time you
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b is married to speaker d	Neutral
A	yeah
D	text
A	but the thing is as well
C	yeah or find
A	you don't even when you're busy at work you have fifteen minutes downtime every now and again don't you?
D	yeah
A	like
B	you've gotta eat your lunch
C	or like
A	exactly
D	yeah
C	just before you go to bed or
B	do you know what I mean? and I'm not being funny even if you forgot like you genuinely forgot
C	you'd be like
B	when you remember
D	is it that long?
[ANNOTATION]	speaker c works at a factory	Neutral
B	when you when you remember you text
D	you go oh shit
B	fucking hell I'm so sorry I forgot your birthday
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b had a birthday party last month	Neutral
B	I'm really sorry how can I make it up to you do you know what I mean?
D	just doesn't make any sense
A	it is it is pretty lame and it er it is it's always worse when people chat the chat first like
C	yeah
A	oh like you know just cos I've got a girlfriend doesn't mean things are gonna change
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b thinks it's important to apologize if you forgot someone's birthday	Entailment
C	and they do
A	mm
A	yeah right okay
A	and the amount of shit I've taken from
D	yeah
A	well there we go
D	I just wanted to say that if I ever get a boyfriend I'll try not to do that
D	if
C	I think we've seen enough
D	yeah
C	to know that you're
D	we know don't don't give up on your friends
A	but the thing is like I honestly don't see how like I obviously spend a lot of time with
D	mm
A	but I I'm that I've never that's really had to be at the sacrifice of anything else
D	yeah
A	so you can still see
D	yeah
A	plenty of whoever it is you wanna see
B	like if want if I if I wanted to spend all my time with you guys I could do it
A	yeah
B	I'd just choose to spend some of my time with
D	yeah
A	yeah
C	yeah
D	yeah
B	do you know what I mean? like it doesn't make a difference but or I'll try and like do it together like
A	yeah
B	it doesn't it's not really
D	yeah
B	like the other a prime example the other day really fucking pissed me off cos we'd just got back from holiday
A	mm
B	and
A	something like that
D	what happened?
A	yeah
B	or whatever I think it all boils down to the fact that
A	he is
B	like and if don't get on with him stay away from him because if you're in the proximity with him he's gonna be a dick to you
D	yeah
B	you don't if you don't
A	I think even if you get on with him he can still be a dick
B	yeah like I'm not being funny like I get on with
A	no
B	do you know what I mean? and it won't be till like he's drunk and like realised that all his conquests are never gonna pay off and then he likes comes and speaks to you and it's like oh are you alright oh fucking girls and all that and then yeah
A	mm
D	mm
B	erm
A	when wasn't it when we were in
B	yeah
B	yeah which was really ironic cos then obviously a couple of weeks later we went to
A	yeah
B	and we went out and all the lads were there and they're like oh hi like they are like oh are you alright how you doing? they tend to talk to me more when I'm with
A	yeah
B	like that was it was like
D	oh my god
B	it was like a kind of like badge of honour thing like
A	yeah
B	not just going like oh by the way I've been with your girlfriend sort of thing
D	oh god
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B was in relationship for 3 years.	Neutral
B	and then so when I when he walked
A	yeah
B	I didn't but obviously he hangs around with
A	yeah
B	or
[ANNOTATION]	There is someone who socialises.	Entailment
A	yeah
B	and unless it's come from like
D	yeah
B	how he knows
D	right
B	and I went yeah he goes so what's your history then did you go out with him? like I didn't actually ever go out with him I think I went out with him for like two weeks in year nine like
B	I said but it's been like
A	yeah
B	like there never has been and he was like and then that was it
A	yeah
B	number two who the fuck does he think he is? and number three why the fuck is he standing there patronising going I erm oh I know what
A	no
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B was seeing someone for a month.	Contradiction
B	like that's why he what he was trying to get across which he does have a good point but cos he was drunk he was angry about it
A	yeah
B	and then later
C	what?
B	and was like
C	why?
B	then was like oh where have you gone?
[ANNOTATION]	Someone had a lot of drinks.	Entailment
A	and I all fairness like to a certain extent he
B	he has a yeah
A	because I I really really resent that kind of behaviour from
B	he doesn't care about me
A	that's that's fucking about with your relationship for the sake of what? proving some sort of point like he's got no right to
D	yeah
A	like
B	yeah and also as well he erm what made it worse is when they
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A detests arrogance.	Neutral
D	oh my god
A	that's exactly
B	fuck
A	what you needed to hear yeah
B	and it was like what? like
D	oh
B	know what I mean like so you're telling me there's nothing really any substitute but
A	no that's
[ANNOTATION]	Someone made a situation ever more difficult.	Entailment
B	like he's that's
A	yeah
B	cos it wasn't like me a
D	mm
B	before I met
A	yeah
B	so like obviously it just helps that I'm with him but erm so anyway
A	yeah
B	and then like but it's obviously a thing that's grinding on
A	yeah
A	no
B	because like
A	yeah
B	speak to me any more like
A	for a bit?
B	so
A	yeah
D	oh that's so annoying
A	I really hate that as well though cos from
B	he just feels like he's getting like
A	yeah he feels like he's on the back foot you feel like
B	yeah
A	and I know it's awkward and I know that's not a conversation you would have wanted to have with
B	well he had a go at me because he said he had a go at me and his argument with me was
A	yeah
B	which it is in my eyes like it's not really like
D	mm
B	I would describe
D	yeah
B	or never well be my friend
C	but then I think
A	no
C	like
B	so
C	because you didn't
B	I was wrong for doing that but I didn't wanna
C	then because you didn't mention it it shows it doesn't mean anything to you
B	yeah or
A	yeah
B	it could mean in his eyes that I'm trying to hide something
A	to hide something
C	yeah precisely
B	so
D	but like then you're
C	it's like catch twenty-two isn't it?
D	you didn't know how
B	knows how
D	but like now he knows you've got a boyfriend
D	yeah
A	yeah
B	but then
D	yeah that's what I mean
B	if I look back on the situation like
A	yeah
B	like and I'd probably have got with
A	yeah
B	so it doesn't really matter like
A	yeah
B	but I haven't spoken to
A	yeah
B	I don't have any time for him like I shouldn't have spoke to
A	oh that's just
B	typical
A	yeah
B	and then obviously what the last thing I want is er all the lads to fight so you've got
A	then she has a history with all of them no
B	yeah
A	I suppose he knows that
B	like everyone
A	yeah
B	do you know what I mean? like
A	mm
A	mm
B	erm so like do you know what I mean though? like it's just everyone's the same like it's all
A	yeah
B	there's no point
D	it just it's just gonna cause trouble isn't it?
B	it just causes trouble and like even if they
C	are they worth the
B	there's only guy
C	is seeing them worth the trouble?
B	I've got like the time for apart from
C	mm
A	yeah
B	and he's like halfway across in the world but he has still
A	I I
B	actually I'm gonna
A	I would like
B	Snapchat him because erm he wrote morning
D	where am I?
D	where am I?
B	here we
C	am I in?
B	yeah
A	erm yeah I I dread bumping into them on a night out cos I just know how fucking awkward it's gonna be cos I have no desire to talk to any of them whatsoever
D	mm it's quite nice because if I was ever out they would never
C	no
D	and they
A	er I'm
A	I I would definitely get an awkward like
D	I'd get like
A	alright
D	yeah I'd say hi like you alright? and then I could easily walk away and
A	yeah
D	that would be it yeah
D	which is quite nice really
[ANNOTATION]	it is a long walk	Neutral
B	oh yeah I I
C	but it was better hanging around with them when we
B	when we were single
C	were single but now we're in a relationships you realise
B	they're like the least people you want around you
D	they just don't give a shit about anyone like
C	no they don't do they?
A	no
D	you know that's the problem like they just
A	they've never really you can tell they're the kind of guys that have never had female friends they've never had like girls they care about that are they're not like fucking
B	banging
A	yeah
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	they are not close to females	Entailment
D	yeah
A	they don't get that they don't get the whole having a relationship with a girl that that isn't about sex
D	mm
B	I know
D	it's really
D	horrible though isn't it like
B	like but
D	mm
B	he will be a dick to you and that's it simple as that
D	I just think he's
[ANNOTATION]	he hates dicks	Neutral
B	he's just a dick
D	I don't like him at all
B	he's a dick he'll bang someone and then just think oh that's it I fucked her that's that's
D	he's a lad isn't he?
C	I think he's
[ANNOTATION]	he is a transgender	Contradiction
D	absolutely disgusting as well
A	I think he's disgusting
B	do you know what they call
A	oh dear
D	no
B	he doesn't he doesn't even look like
D	he is yeah
B	I feel like going yeah but without the fucking shit hair and bad teeth
D	the teeth
C	oh
[ANNOTATION]	he lost teeth in a fight	Neutral
D	oh my god yeah
B	has he even got any teeth?
D	I don't even know any more
D	I dunno but he he probably doesn't ever brush them so
D	he's probably not gonna have any teeth
A	he's so scrawny as well I don't really like that in a guy
[ANNOTATION]	his does not have full teeth	Entailment
C	he's just like really
B	he's scrawny fat do you know what I mean by that?
A	yeah
D	what do you mean?
C	like he's not really he doesn't
D	it does like so
B	he's thin but he's got a gut
D	oh yeah
C	yeah they don't like look after themselves really
A	no
D	oh yeah
A	oh
D	just little boys really aren't they?
A	I've been quite sad though
A	cos like the year the year above us the boys and girls got on and then like the year below us the boys and girls are still really close and then I see our year and we're like we never had that kind of relationship with the boys like ever
D	but we did do a lot with them like
A	yeah but I still don't
D	obviously when when we're at school it was like
A	I still think we were friends though
B	no

B	I find
A	mm
B	and I find

C	I do I do actually think sometimes
B	thing this is what annoys me about
C	he's probably like
B	one to one level
A	I can have a conversation with
C	yeah
D	I think he's just influenced so much
B	on a one to one level and he's polite and he's not rude but like
D	I just don't he's
C	he's influenced by everybody isn't he?
B	he's just a fucking dick like
D	I hate that
C	thing is I never believed that he would be like that cos obviously we knew him from like
B	yeah
C	primary school and he like he like it's such a shame cos I think he could have been if he hadn't been around
D	he could have been much better
C	all them lot
B	he could have been great if he'd gone to America
C	he could have been a lot much
B	if he'd just just fucked off and gone to America when he had that opportunity to and come back
C	right he wouldn't be
B	he would have been a different person
C	he'd come be like he'd like be
D	yeah
C	wouldn't he?
B	but instead he's fallen into this fucking
D	that's just ridiculous
A	yeah
B	two different
C	how can you
B	two different mums two different child but are you fucking for real then?
C	what kind of like
B	like either what people are you meeting

D	he doesn't come out any more we've never we haven't had a
A	yeah
D	I'm like why the fuck do you think you know what I mean?
A	it yeah he can't he he's categorically said to me like obviously in the line of work he is now there's no way he could be seen out with them
B	no
A	he was saying like he was saying last night he was like
B	but do they ever get bored of town?
A	I know
B	like do they ever get bored of town?
D	they've always got
A	but they fucked though aren't they? they the amount of shit they have to take to have a good time in
D	it's just disgusting
B	you do see for yourself like when you see them walking don't you you're like really?
B	like you're like I'm pretty fucked like I'm I'm pretty drunk you must be fucked like
A	yeah
B	and sometimes they're like oh I had a or they'll write like quality night or whatever the next day and I'm like I swear I saw you guys standing round a table
A	yeah
B	just like in
B	like and just like moving over here and then like moving over there like not even dancing like
D	oh god
B	surely as well taking that much stuff like I obviously I've taken drugs
A	no
B	so what you what are you getting out of it?
A	yeah apart from an empty wallet
B	yeah
D	yeah that's true and you probably feel like shit for the whole week
B	and what makes it even funnier like and maybe I I know this is gonna sound bad but maybe with something something like cocaine
D	yeah
A	I don't what do they do are any of them earning decent money?
B	well I know that erm
A	that's fun
B	in the building it's the same building so
D	right
B	erm
A	yeah
B	and then I don't know what
D	I think it's something to do with
B	at first and then I knew he was working somewhere
D	oh dear
B	ask
D	mm
B	but like I swear it's like something to do with like farm foods or something I don't know
D	mm
A	fair enough
B	and then I couldn't even do you know what? I don't even know what they do
C	mate
C	I've got fucking no idea
B	I thought like you know
A	from some of small talk it might have come out
A	well that just shows you do not have small talk with these people really
B	no
C	not even small talk
A	no
D	no
B	what the fuck
B	do they do like what
A	it's just they just all they do is chat shit
C	the only person that knew what they did was
B	I knew that he worked
C	but that's basically why
B	you know why I know he works at
C	that's it
B	when we were at mine like oh your mate works at
C	well what does everyone
B	there's loads of the pricks I don't know
D	I know they
B	and as well the few girls they hang around with hang around with loads of young people
A	yeah
B	like erm
A	they just keep recruiting and it's like
B	recruiting to like make
A	yeah
B	like they're the henchman
A	yeah
B	and they just keep recruiting the newer ones
C	I know he works there
B	and he keeps getting suspended
D	is he still there?
B	yeah
D	oh my god
C	they'll never sack him though
D	how do they even keep jobs?
B	no
A	no
D	they probably do it for the
A	clearly
B	yeah erm erm
B	er?
C	doesn't he work at
B	he's a builder
B	yeah he always in a van on his Snapchats he had boots on the other day and like shot cut off shorts like behind a cement mixer
C	oh maybe he's
C	moved on then
B	oh yeah
C	cos he was working for er
B	oh yeah no
C	and then when he came back I think he was working at
A	mm yeah
B	well clearly I think so
C	and that's the only reason I knew what
B	I don't know all of them finish at like one on a Friday
D	Friday how does it like do they where do they live?
B	at home I think?
A	what are all of them
A	still at home?
C	oh my god
D	that's ridiculous
A	so what does he bring girls home? that's really fucking awkward
D	that's disgusting
B	I remember one time
B	what are you doing?
C	has he got a single bed?
B	yeah
C	oh that's hilarious
C	I feel sorry for
B	cos
D	I feel sorry for his parents
A	mm oh god
B	so yeah
A	yeah for him and his kid
D	oh that's ridiculous
B	but the kids not ever there
C	it's always shit
D	is it? it's such a shame when they could give us the money and we could
A	I honestly thought actually having a kid might like turn
D	sort him out
B	well you know second time lucky
D	yeah
B	erm
D	might just be third
B	and then who else
A	no it helps that he's in
D	yeah he seems quite civilised doesn't he?
A	yeah
B	yeah but not he wasn't for a long time and if he hangs round with them he's a bit of a dick
A	yeah
D	yeah I think it's only because of them that like he's probably not actually that but actually
A	I think it's a bit of a defence mechanism when you're around them though you kind of
D	yeah you have to be on your guard
A	yeah
D	don't you and
A	but yeah I mean
D	yeah
A	I haven't seen him in ages though to be honest
B	erm
A	yeah the last time I spoke to him like what he was what he was doing sounded really intense and he was getting like five days off a year and all that sort of shit
B	yeah
D	who's that?
D	they don't have as much holiday do they?
A	paid time off isn't really that much of a thing cos they have a lot of state holidays and all that kind of stuff but I remember last year when he came back he was basically saying like he er he was only allowed five days off that year and he had to basically time it with like Thanksgiving and stuff so that he could get home for like long enough to warrant the
D	coming home
A	the plane fare yeah
D	oh god
A	so I don't know if like it's different this year
B	I'm hoping he comes round when erm
A	I imagine he will I can't
B	cos it's it's
A	although he's off to
B	is he?
A	yeah
D	that's a really nice idea
A	yeah
D	I think
B	erm
A	I am
D	yeah
A	dictate
B	mm
A	cos he's still not
A	he's still not earning enough
D	but he
B	I mean I spoke I messaged him today on
D	have to
A	no but I've also had
A	I have had this conversation with him and
D	really?
A	no I really want a nice long engagement like preferably three years maybe even four like I really wanna enjoy being engaged for a while before I have to start planning
D	yeah
A	a wedding and blah blah blah and they're like no like I'd only he basically said he'd only propose to
D	why is everyone is such a rush?
B	yeah
A	I don't know
B	but I'm quite traditional like that
D	well you are aren't you?
B	no no no but I wanna be like I wanna be married within like a year and a half
D	but realistically like from when you get engaged like
A	yeah
D	the least time you'd need to plan
B	I'd want at least a year
D	yeah
B	to save so it would be like a year and a half
D	yeah
B	it would be when I'd wanna get married
D	yeah so it's like you're not
A	I think I'd I'd just enjoy having a ring for a while I think
B	I think you I think you no I don't think you would I think you'd just be like this
D	depends how good the ring is
B	you'd just be like
A	yeah
B	no
D	hey
B	listen to her it's nothing to do with her ring and enjoy having a ring for a while
[ANNOTATION]	Someone received a bracelet.	Contradiction
A	probably
B	she wants to chill and she'll be like
D	I don't blame her
A	but also like
B	oh it'll happen
A	yeah
B	it'll happen
A	I have no
D	it's stressful I think it's ridiculously stressful like though
A	I have no idea what I want like yeah and I change my mind so much
A	we'd get books

A	I like that
D	but it is one of
B	how will you tell your friends that
D	it's one of my first designer
B	that
D	designer card
B	you're engaged? because you know what I have a problem with? people going
A	oh no no no
B	no no that is not gonna happen here
A	I've
A	and then it'll be like
D	I don't know if I'd wanna make a big deal out of it
[ANNOTATION]	25 is a good age to get engaged.	Neutral
B	oh I'll invite all my like definitely invite all my girls and
A	yeah
B	like and just be like
B	yeah
B	no I
D	you've
B	this would be pure comedy
D	yeah
B	no but I think I'll
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B will ask only boys to come.	Contradiction
D	and then we
A	I one hundred percent wouldn't put it on Facebook
B	no
A	yeah
B	might put like
[ANNOTATION]	Someone would not upload something on Instagram.	Contradiction
A	to engaged
B	to
B	she's already yeah but yeah I might you know change my status
D	I'm never probably gonna get married so
B	don't be so bloody stupid
D	now we've said that so obviously not
B	you've said that you're missing the
D	I've just accepted the fact that
B	are you gonna have babies?
D	there's a girl there's a girl at work she's given me a little bit of hope she was single for like seven years and then she found her man at the last minute
C	she only found him at when she was twenty-eight
A	yeah
C	you know
B	that happens
C	which is
A	I've got quite I've got quite a few
D	I know but
A	like older cousins who are only just getting married and they're like mid-thirties
D	yeah it happens a lot later these days
A	yeah
D	like I'd rather
D	little
B	you might meet the man at a wedding
A	yeah
B	on the films
D	fucking better like
A	on the films
D	invite who knows anybody
C	you need people to
D	the
C	invite some new people to your wedding please
B	well you only have you have to invite new people
A	yeah but it's like it's he like
C	well yeah
A	cousins
A	and stuff
A	that you would
B	hit it off
A	yeah
D	I know true
C	no
A	I've got a cousin
D	I reckon
A	I've got a cousin who no er he's got a kid now so it might might not be irrelevant but he looks just like Gaston from Beauty and the Beast
B	no the big ones
A	yeah he really does look just like Gaston
A	it's really weird
B	erm
D	hold on a sec
B	yeah maybe
D	what time is it?
C	twenty past nine
B	er maybe the you know you can erm
D	oh I stayed
C	yeah well yeah
C	like it's Tuesday
B	erm
B	it's Tuesday it's nearly Christmas
D	you know
B	and
D	I like that I like the e-card that's like it's nothing that ruins more Friday more than realising it's Tuesday
B	erm
D	it's quite exciting isn't it?
B	yeah we spoke about this but I won't be invited anyway so I'm not really bothered about that one
A	you would be invited
B	I don't think I would
A	oh you're telling me that
B	she would
A	no she wouldn't
B	you don't think she would
D	I reckon she'd invite you and then she'd be like you choose
C	invite you and then it'll be your own choice
B	she'd invite she wouldn't invite me
D	yeah I think
A	she would
B	it would be awful there'd be no point in me going
D	she's going to
B	she wouldn't invite me though I don't think she will
A	about why you can't come?
B	yeah
D	that's ridiculous though isn't it?
C	I don't think she'd dare
A	I hadn't even thought about it
C	I don't think she'd dare not invite you
B	she would not I think she would erm
D	she does
B	have a family hen do and then she'd invite me to the
B	other hen do but not to the wedding
D	oh well
A	I definitely think I definitely think she'll be first cos I just think like I get the impression
D	yeah
B	do you think?
A	yeah
D	I reckon
C	yeah
D	actually
A	like it's really weird me and
D	oh
A	acting upon it
D	that's so lovely
A	have no intention of acting upon it
D	well yeah
A	like any time soon
B	so you think
C	I think it's nice that like
B	you cos I'm basically you don't have a fucking clue because
A	no
D	that's true
B	no
A	yeah
B	do you know what I mean like
D	you don't know
B	I wish you'd stop
D	I know it would
B	with this shit because like I know you
C	there's nothing wrong with like
D	do it if you did leave it though and then
A	mm
D	then it would be nice if it came
B	there's nothing wrong with there's nothing wrong with leaving it but she don't know it's out of her control
D	no I know I know yeah
A	yes but I also
B	it's well you
A	I do know
A	no
D	she
B	oh you know we we're not you know we're both in this place where we both know
A	I know he's lazy as fuck though and he's not gonna do it until he's like
B	he might surprise you
A	feels obliged
D	yeah
D	feels
B	yeah
D	I should probably
B	are you for real? like we've got three kids
B	are you gonna fucking propose? cos otherwise I'm leaving
A	yeah that'll be funny
B	yeah I do wonder I thought maybe
D	yeah
A	it's an
D	but then how have they actually been together now?
C	not that long
A	a year
D	oh okay
A	a year in July so that's probably not quite fair nearly eighteen months
D	yeah they're pretty quick with things aren't they?
B	so I reckon erm
A	they're going to Australia
A	this proper trip and they're gonna go they're I think the wedding's in Perth so they're gonna spend a few days in Perth and they're gonna like fly over to somewhere else and then fly over to somewhere else and like oh
B	yeah
D	bang
A	yeah
B	erm
C	it's just all a bit
B	erm who else? there's
A	he won't even move in with her will he?
B	no
D	will he not?
B	well he will but only if he rents he won't buy
D	will he not?
B	when they have an opportunity to buy
A	yeah
D	that's really shit
C	that's awkward
D	that's really awkward I did not know that
C	why won't he buy?
B	he just doesn't feel ready to do it yet
A	he's being
D	it's got to be something really
A	like all like mighty sensible about the situation
D	well I suppose it is sensible to a certain extent but it's a little bit
B	it is sensible
D	it's a bit
B	but they I just think that it's
C	no I think it
A	it is a
B	been long enough now
A	yeah
B	to know whether they're gonna be together or not
D	if they do
A	you kind of make the plunge or you don't
B	yeah
A	renting at that point if you've got the opportunity to buy is a little bit of a waste of money
B	mm
D	mm there's nothing to purchase
B	so like erm
D	is there a plug anywhere?
C	yeah one down here
D	oh
B	what er
A	I can't work out either by the way whether
D	yeah
A	when we got back she was like sending me messages like on Snapchat
D	about that
A	yeah
D	I was like
A	so
C	I spoke like
A	yeah so that yeah so I like took the picture and I thought ha ha ha ha and then I sent it and then I thought
A	and then I thought
D	and taking it too far
A	über-bitch
A	yeah
B	no she does realise she doesn't think you're being a bitch
A	okay that's good news
B	erm like she
D	I don't think she'd joke if it was
B	it's like when I said earlier like are you okay are you down about this?
B	you wanna give me a call? like she doesn't cos like it it's just one of them things she can't really help it like
B	and
D	is she now?
B	yeah I don't how long it will like I don't think it's I don't know whether there's a lot of longevity in it she doesn't seem that excited about it to be fair
A	is this the same mate she was seeing a few weeks ago?

B	so if we had a baby you would be fine?
A	no
B	you would be fine
A	I'd
A	no I was talking about this last night because
B	and the kid's coming
A	and
D	yeah
A	like they're not gonna ski and then his mum will probably just have to stay in the chalet all day with the kid and that's just an expensive
C	or an expensive nanny
A	well exactly
A	erm but they were saying it is really awkward because like you're not rejecting them as a friend and you're not saying that their life choice is is bad but you're just saying that in certain
A	in certain situations
D	situations it's not
B	you shouldn't bring a child
A	it's not that handy to have a kid around and like
C	no they could
A	cos that that that was my main problem I sort of said like
B	but surely that person knows that like that's like me like you guys were going
B	you know what I mean like? I'll I'll keep it in my bag while I go like
A	but it's like it's also the situation that like if if if one of you guys had a kid
D	to be
A	when you're with your kid like I would still like to do stuff cos we're obviously still quite young it would still be nice to like have people come out for a night out or
B	and not bring the kid
A	yeah and I know that's that probably sounds really harsh but like
A	I just think like sometimes
A	I just think like if you're really good friends with someone as much as you you will love their kid like
D	of our life yeah
A	to want to be around kids all the time like you'll still
D	mm
A	wanna do stuff
B	but you tend to be more tolerant of other people's children when you have children of your own cos you
A	yeah
B	you realise that like with me
B	like I would
D	oh my god that's so annoying
B	and I kind of just turned around and I
B	get your fucking child away from my feet
B	what are you doing? I'm gonna fall over your child and I'm gonna trip over and then who are you gonna be shouting at? me for tripping over your fucking child
B	who's running around me like a fucking tripwire
B	like do you know what I mean? like I'm gonna end up killing your child with my pure size like this little kid
B	and I just felt like taking the
B	you know what I mean I'd just had enough like I'm
D	we had that situation the other day didn't we?
C	yeah and I just
D	and they're just under your feet and
A	yeah
B	but l like babies
A	yeah
D	fucking move
B	I really like babies you know when I see babies I'm like I'm like oh look
C	yeah they're cute aren't they?
B	oh the baby's lovely and quiet and they're sitting there going yeah when they're quiet and it's not that loud
C	yeah when they're quiet yeah
D	they're quite loud
B	no well some some babies aren't loud like some babies are loud I don't want that one but erm
B	some babies are like not really like and they're just there they're just you know they're just there and like
A	and you can pass them around
B	you can pass them around
A	yeah
B	so you leave your arm and then you like you put you put them down and they
B	they don't even they don't say anything
B	and yet the kids going like you see them walking around and the woman's Christmas shopping and she's pulling
D	oh
B	and they're like mum mum
D	oh god
B	mum and I'd just be like
D	haven't seen your fucking child
B	no do you know what I mean? I'm thinking why are you not talking to that child?
B	because I will talk to that child
D	I will shout at them
B	and then I just don't get it and like when I see er come on come on and they grab the wrist of the child come on come on
B	like this and they're like going and I'm thinking and the child's like
D	that's the way
B	and that's what I want to be able to do to my child
D	yeah
B	I don't want it to be scared of me but I want them to know
D	respect
A	that you've got the authority
B	like
D	respect for your elders
A	yeah
B	I can't ever imagine going going
B	really? mr fucking hasn't got his head screwed on right I don't really think so but
B	I dunno I don't really I don't really see that I'm not ready for that like
D	what?
C	I don't know about
B	well fucking hell
A	mm
B	well this is the girl
D	oh my god
B	and she was like oh and
D	oh god
B	and I was like erm how did er how
B	like literally I didn't know what to say I was like how did this happen? and she was like
C	shit
B	she was like well erm my mum really suffers erm from miscarriages so they advised me not to go on the pill I nearly just went bullshit
B	like do you know what I mean? like you fucking liar you sat and lie to everyone now like literally that show how much of a like
A	but I don't even give a shit like even if even if if even if you took her at face value and that was totally legit
B	yeah I know
A	why wouldn't you use a condom?
B	yeah
D	yeah
B	and why won't why you didn't use a condom
D	that doesn't mean
B	and also as well if you let's give you a rough benefit of the doubt and say
A	yeah
B	I'm going to seek medical advice like if you were overly aware that that was a problem
D	yeah
B	that you actually had because you couldn't do it
A	yeah
B	because of the miscarriages which by the way miscarriages aren't hereditary so that's bull crap like
A	yeah
B	why do you not why would you and then you sat there and lied to his parents about it like what are you doing? like what are you doing you've trapped him like and I don't think for one second he shouldn't
C	how old is he?
B	he's twenty-one I don't think for one second he shouldn't have gone like
D	yeah
B	and if I'm fully aware that I can't be on contraception and on the pill
A	yeah
B	they don't think about it's visual for them the condom like they don't they don't
A	you why on earth are they announcing this information until
D	now
B	yeah
A	yeah like
B	so they haven't even had the scan right?
D	yeah she's not
B	so they've rented they still they've rented a house and moving on the third of January they've only just got an appointment for a they've got an appointment for a doctor don't even know if they've got an appointment for a scan yet because he might go oh you're er you're you're thirteen weeks pregnant
D	mm
B	ten to like whatever it is
C	twenty-eight
B	yeah but your period
B	you're on a period for five days
A	yeah
B	which theoretically means
D	that's right
B	that they must have had sex five weeks ago or like in that fifth week period but
A	but they wouldn't surely they wouldn't have even been able to like estimate that she's four weeks' pregnant
B	well apparently she took a test this Clearblue one that says you know you've seen it on TV like
D	how many weeks
A	oh right
B	yeah but like I'm not being funny like
A	fuck me
B	fucking hell
D	that seems a bit funny
B	it seems a bit weird doesn't it?
A	it seems a bit convenient
B	and also as well like obviously she she lived in a hostel she doesn't really speak to her mum she now lives in like a bedsit that the council obviously gave her like I'm not being funny this is all a bit fucking
D	yeah
B	I want a family like do you know what I mean?
D	yeah
B	like it was all a bit fucking
B	seeing a psychopath
D	yeah
B	and I think that she's gonna but she knew I knew she was fucking bullshitting because when er we went back into the thingy the back into er thingy bob they erm the
B	I know you're lying
B	I just looked though know what I mean? I just went like
D	mm
B	and she was like she caught my eye and she went
D	she totally knows
B	and I was like
D	she totally knows
B	you know I know you're a fucking bullshitting bitch like why are such a twat? like and
D	it'll all come out though won't it?
C	yeah
D	if you're not pregnant then you're not pregnant
A	that's just embarrassing isn't it?
B	like oh yeah like oh
D	like she knows
D	mm
A	I
D	it's really annoying
A	I even with
B	yeah
A	but I had enough sense to wake up in the morning and go mm
B	yeah it's not like oh my god I'm overwhelmed with love for this person after four weeks that I'm just gonna think it'll be okay
D	yeah
B	if I have a baby c'est la vie
B	you know what I mean like?
D	yeah
A	like if it was if I'd slept with someone who I'd who I didn't really know certainly didn't know like what my relationship would end up being or whatever
D	mm
A	there's absolutely no way I'd take the chance
B	but she obviously wanted that baby
A	yeah
C	yeah yeah
B	for that to happen
D	mm
B	so yeah
A	well the thing is like the reality is if she is pregnant regardless of whether or not
B	well it's fifteen percent of his wages gone straight away
C	what do you mean? like
B	the CSA are fucking hounds they will chase you for that money like and you can take them
C	oh for when they're like
B	take them to court
C	sixteen or something
B	up until
C	okay
B	and it's fifteen percent of your wages basically
A	although I'd like to point out like obviously in this situation that's a bit shit
B	is perfectly alright
A	yeah
B	like I don't
A	I I think of my parents' situation and I know my mum's
D	yeah that's it
A	my mum's whole wage for the last like twelve and fifteen years has gone on me and
B	yeah
A	whereas I've seen like shit all of my dad's money
B	yeah
C	yeah same here
B	yeah like and that's the same with my dad like what we were just saying earlier like how like obviously cos me
A	yeah
B	like we're gonna go and see him on Saturday
A	is this is different brother or
B	this is a different brother the other one
A	okay
B	he's a mortgage advisor
A	I'm getting confused
B	he's got four brothers
C	all these brothers
A	okay
D	wow
B	yeah
B	erm
A	I
B	he's got
A	okay
B	so
C	has he is got a another younger brother then?
A	so is he one of four?
C	so he's got three or
B	sorry not four brothers
C	mm
B	so yeah
A	yeah I can imagine
B	because
D	I think that
B	I am very I'm I'm although I'm really family orientated or I'm also
D	you're not that yeah
B	very much about my friends
A	that sounds so sketchy though like I can't get over that
B	what that girl?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	mm
D	mm
B	but like
D	yeah
B	it's plain to see
D	I think yeah
B	it's obvious
C	it's just natural
B	like I'm pissed off I'm angry
C	when he's gone something in his mind there's no changing him
B	and like he just like he he literally like every time we see his mum he'll just be like
A	he can't be supportive of it
B	he can't be supportive of it
C	it's like
D	gotta be true to yourself
B	he can't yeah he can't like and when we were standing there and his mum was like you know we you know we can't do anything about it now
A	no
B	his mum's only doing what
C	I know
D	well she's gonna wanna support her son isn't she?
C	what she thinks is best yeah
B	she can't see her son going out nobody parent can really
A	no
B	can they? but
D	that's a difficult
B	what does that girl bring to the table? fuck all
C	I hope that it's not actually
B	and he she's gonna pay for the water the gas and electric
D	will you keep us updated on the situation?
C	yeah can you keep us updated when you find out?
B	yeah and to be honest with you I hope I hope she turns out that she's fucking full of shit she wants to she wants to hope for her sake that it's not
A	I hope
B	that she that this is kosher and this is
A	yeah
B	if it's not
A	that I
B	he'll be stuck with the
A	that's what I think's gonna happen and I think she's
C	why would he be stuck with the rent?
A	she is gonna be pregnant but the timing's not gonna match up
B	no
A	cos it's too convenient
B	yeah
D	yeah
A	that she's four weeks' pregnant
D	but then what would happen if it's
A	but they slept together a week three and a half weeks ago
D	not his? like
B	yeah
D	he wouldn't have to pay surely
B	no he wouldn't have to pay it's his choice whether he's involved in her life after that
A	yeah
B	I should hope he'd have the sense to fucking
D	I'd hope so
B	cos that would be the worst fucking situation ever
D	like he's like that's kind of like life ruined
A	er it is a bit
C	yes
A	it's a bit young to take on that responsibility like I think maybe if he was like seven or eight years older like perhaps if he really cared about somebody he could see past the fact that
B	if he wasn't
A	it wasn't his
D	is she?
B	but all she does is bakes
B	and you know how I feel about this? like if you're a certain like she put up something the other day I wanna show you this picture she put this up the other day
D	yeah
B	and he was a thing from plus-size models now in my mind plus-size models what they are
A	yeah
D	yeah
B	they're not fucking size twenty-eights
D	yeah
A	no and also they're always normally like six foot something so like even if they're a size sixteen
D	this is the look fuck it
A	they're all in proportion
D	yeah
C	yeah they always look really nice though
A	yeah
D	I think they look nice
B	yeah they look like they look curvy and whatever
C	just look normal like
A	mm
C	like a normal woman
A	yeah
D	yeah
A	they look in proportion
C	not fat
A	yeah
C	but yeah
B	right well she put something up the other day I don't know whether she's taken it off right no and here we go
B	plus-size modelling
D	yeah
A	okay
B	this is the picture but this isn't the worst bit about it
C	that's actually quite a nice picture
B	well yeah you can see that she's it's not really like a plus-size model really because she's like it's not really like
C	cos she yeah
B	most plus-size models are like they're bigger
C	they're quite toned
B	but they they're toned still
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	if you think I'm too big for you the chances are you don't have the right equipment for the job anyway right?
B	this goes out to every man who's ever rejected me your loss buddy right? and I clicked on plus-size modelling thinking plus-size modelling have a look at this site is it actually a plus-size modelling actually no it's not a plus-size modelling
D	just
B	thing it's just fat people
B	in erm it's just fat people in weird outfits
B	and let me just show you this you know you wouldn't have a problem if it was you know a you know a bit of a a fat person I mean
A	if it's that big why are you zooming in?
D	yeah
B	I'm just showing you things so you can see the whole
A	oh god
C	I can't work it out
B	what the fuck is that?
D	like
A	yeah
B	she's just
D	what does it say under that then?
D	what does it say on that strapline?
B	rah this sexy plus-size fox is looking flawless in her costume
B	now what on earth this that?
D	they're just like normal people aren't they?
B	like I'm not being funny I
B	and I just think to myself like
B	right? you're not a plus-size model you just you're just like it's just too much like she and
B	there's anything wrong with that you know what I mean like be who you are right? but don't trap a man yeah and then fatten him up
A	so he can't do anything
B	so he can't do anything about it cos like what he's gonna do he's gonna have a nervous breakdown
D	yeah
B	because fucking Betty fucking Crocker over there is fucking him feeding him all the cakes in the world
B	do you know what mean?
