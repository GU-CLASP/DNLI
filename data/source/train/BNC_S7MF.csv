B	I'm so excited
A	I can imagine is it Dominican Republic you're going? that's I've never that's so cool never been I really would like to I've heard it's really pretty
B	mm I'm actually very excited now that's not even I thought I'd be less excited I mean now
A	yeah but you can just it's on the horizon it's there
B	yeah I need a break as well I'm so sick of work people are annoying
A	have you had any holiday since? like any
B	Portugal
A	oh yeah
B	that was just that was really good actually that was nicely needed
A	I was going to say you kind of get to this time of year with the sun and you're just a bit like oh my god I need to have some time off I need a break
B	I'm just so over people like this woman I mean fair enough she's she's obviously really really worried about her husband but he's got a a chest infection
A	yeah
B	and I won't see him before he was admitted to hospital and I because she she she'd rung the GP and the GP was like not coming out it's probably his medication and she rang me and was like we need to change the medication and I was like that's fine so we changed the medication I went to see him and he did look he was like quite lethargic and
A	because you didn't pick up the yeah
B	why didn't you pick it up? it's like well why didn't you pick it up as well to be quite honest?
A	yeah
B	cos you know? anyway
A	but do you know like I've had a cold for like a week over a week now and like I'm still this like sniffy and shit today
B	mm
A	and I was like and someone was like maybe it's a virus and I was like mm I'd never even thought about that like you don't know what's wrong with you and you
B	you don't and
A	you can't just put it down like being lethargic to an infection for fuck's sake
B	no and so he's got I I think he's got quite a bad infection
A	mm
B	but it sort of it sort of happened really quickly over a couple of days
A	where is the infection though?
B	lung infection
A	oh oh
B	chest infection
A	but if he wasn't coughing or anything like that then why would you assume he's got a lung infection?
B	no well he was coughing she not but not when I was there she said oh he's had this cough for like months and months and I was like okay fine
A	yeah
B	but
A	also you're not a doctor so it's not your job like
B	no anyway he's in hospital now which is fine so he's getting looked after and stuff but she rang me like when he's in hospital sort of I back off because that's not really my arena he's in hospital so he's being looked after he's safe that fine so she was like I need you to change the medication again cos I think I I don't think it's helping me cos he he's hallucinating and he's really slurry and I was like okay fine I don't think they'll be making any changes whilst he's still physically unwell in hospital
A	yeah yeah
B	because he's physically unwell
A	yeah
B	so people especially older people react with hallucinating and slurring of speech when they have an infection so I'm pretty sure it's still the infection
A	yeah same with a urine infection as well like it can really mess you up
B	yeah really mess you up so she's like oh but I'm I'm I'm really not sure I I thought you'd be more supportive of me on this I was like well I am but I just I'm telling you now that I don't think it's going to help him all this medication change I think he should just stick to one
A	yeah cos like sometimes you have to get well not get over the side effects but you have to wait for it to settle down don't you?
B	yeah but I don't really see what she wants me to do she was like if have you rang the ward yet? And I was like well no
A	mm
B	they're not going to tell me anything else from that that that they've told you because you know? I don't need to know really he's in hospital
A	yeah
B	and she's like well I I I said would you find it helpful if I liaise with the ward? and she was like well yes I would okay well I I completely forgot to do it today cos it's not it's not on my to do list at all
B	so I was like shit I forgot to do it so I rang her and it was her daughter and I was like I'm really sorry but erm I didn't get round to doing it today I'll do it tomorrow morning and give give her an update call she was like oh well her mobile number was de de de if you want to ring her mobile and I was like well I'm going home now I didn't say that but I was like it's it's it's probably just better that I just you know
A	ring her with info yeah
B	ring her with an update not just babble on about that I haven't got an update god but she's just so like makes almost makes you feel guilty about it and it's like okay fine I'm really sorry that that your husband is unwell in hospital but he's in hospital
A	yeah it's the best place for him
B	it isn't like he's sort of wandering around the streets is it?
A	no some people when like when their like family are ill they become quite like
B	yeah
A	they lose not lose their priority but they kind of just they go a bit crazy themselves don't they?
B	she's lost it I think I mean lost her sort of rationality a little bit
A	yeah just that obviously she must be a bit stressed
B	and I I I can understand that it's probably
A	and it must be an awful situation
B	it's probably quite scary
A	but there's nothing you can do like
B	I can't
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	but she just doesn't even seem to understand that I don't know she's a bit manipulative actually
A	I got that impression from my boss this morning not this morning when was it? one day last week she sent out an email and we were
B	mm
A	and I messaged one of the other girls on my team I was like did she ask you if you were happy with how the new system was working? cos I'm not entirely sure who has told her that this new process is working well because it's really not
B	so she's just lying
A	she's just yeah she's just like sent round this email being like oh yeah this program is or this new process is really working well everybody's getting on board no we're not I haven't even used the new process yet because I'm avoiding it because it's so shit
A	like
B	what an idiot
A	it's just like who did you ask
B	mm
A	to think that this process is working? you just want to justify giving us all this extra bureaucracy
B	mm
A	I was so annoyed and then
B	it's that good silly woman
A	oh I know
B	oh no I spoke to this man today it's really sad he's got his he's got his wife's got dementia
A	mm
B	he's really not coping cos he's just like I guess just doesn't get out and just feels like he needs to be at home all the time looking after her and stuff
A	yeah
B	and he was just he just started crying down the phone
A	oh don't oh that would that would that would make me cry so much
B	ah so I'm going to see him on Thursday bless him
A	oh
B	he was like he he said erm I I just want someone to come and talk to her and see what like why she's sort of being so resistive to everything cos apparently she's quite difficult to deal with
A	it's just part of the
B	mm exactly but I think she's also got pre-morbid personality of sort of being quite difficult anyway and not like if if she doesn't like you then she won't talk to you
A	oh I see yeah
B	so that's going to be interesting but we we we have got the same name so I think that's some good good ground
A	maybe she'll look at you and think that you're her but like her younger self
B	that could be a bad thing
A	that'd be weird but it could be like
B	I hate you you're young
A	you're young and free and innocent and crazy and I'm not
B	old old and crazy
A	mm
B	but yeah we'll see how it goes down
A	how is it only Monday?
B	I don't know the office was absolutely dead today as well and that normally happens on Friday so it felt even weirder
A	yeah last Friday work was really empty it's just like it's so nice when there's no one in
B	I quite like it I mean it's very quiet but
A	I just love it I love when there's like hardly anybody in the office
B	yeah
A	oh I've got such it's not oh no yeah I do have sun sun burn I got sun burn all round my back cos I was out on Saturday at this at the castle and the seaside and
B	oh yeah how was that?
A	ah it was really fun it was really really good
B	mm
A	erm went to the castle erm had the Knights Day and the tournament and then we went on to the beach and then went to the fish and chip shop which is apparently the best fish and chip shop in
B	was it?
A	yeah it was really good actually there was a massive queue outside took like twenty twenty-five minutes to queue for this fish and chips
B	I love fish and chips
A	I know it was so worth it
B	it's so good when it's by the sea as well
A	yeah and then we sat on the beach and ate it
B	ah
A	and then drove back here we got back here about when was it? maybe about nine
B	yeah
A	and then he had to go pick up
B	what in
A	no in
B	oh god
A	so he was like he was like an hour late for her
B	that wasn't planned very well was it?
A	well he just kept being like erm shall we go to the beach? yeah okay
B	bit weird isn't it? great
A	I know
B	love hey
A	erm but he met
B	that's good
A	yeah it was a really nice relaxing day
B	good
A	and then I just went for the run on Sunday
B	oh yeah how was that?
A	it was really good I was really surprised I did the first ever run I did erm fourteen just over fourteen kilometres
B	yeah
A	which is
B	yeah
A	no nine and half nine miles something like that erm hour and a half's running
B	yeah
A	erm did it was good got to the end was like oh I can do this
B	great you can do it
A	so I feel much more confident about it but I got sunburnt cos it was such nice day but I did not think about putting on cream
B	no
A	erm yeah no so I feel much more confident about this bloody run now
B	good ow
A	you alright?
B	hot
A	burning yourself
B	burning myself with water
A	so when are you next seeing
B	erm I don't know cos we're both quite busy now
A	yeah
B	until we go on holiday so
A	no I didn't but yeah
B	erm so
A	yeah I know I saw the spider earlier so I was like oh yeah the weekend I'm in
B	yeah but I'm working that day at the pub and the next day could see him the next day I suppose but then that would be a bit weird sort of
A	Friday and then not Saturday and then yeah
B	yeah bit of an effort really
A	I love you but too much effort
B	too much effort we have a whole two weeks together soon so
A	are you going for two weeks?
B	well ten days but ten days there and twelve it's sort of two days travelling so
A	well
B	almost two weeks
A	yeah yeah I think I think you can get rid of him for a few weeks and then just make up for it in one massive session
B	yeah
A	for two weeks yeah not like a massive dirty session just like a bonding time
A	like a
B	I think yeah that wouldn't be a relaxing holiday at all would it?
A	you'd be like
B	open my vagina
A	he'd be like
B	oh god bad times
A	yeah let's let's not break your vagina
B	I think I need that
A	you think you need that
B	it could be quite useful I think for the future
A	what a broken vagina
B	on a non broken vagina
A	oh I see yeah I was like what?
B	I meant I need my vagina
A	yes yes yes you do
B	yes I do oh I didn't make the tuna
A	oh no is mummy
B	er no she's taking
A	oh nice
B	they're travelling overnight on Thursday and then getting there on Friday that is really cloudy and horrible
A	yeah was it in the dishwasher?
B	yeah
A	dishwasher is really weird it keeps leaving stuff and it's like
B	I know
A	like dry residue or
B	I think it's cos the water's so hard
A	yeah
B	horrible
A	the water here is grim
B	it's horrible erm yeah so we're going to go to the beach and stuff
A	that's cool
B	get them buy them some like wet suits and just let them go
A	go see swim
B	go to the sea
A	I love going to the sea
B	I think you she's feeling a bit like she needs children in her life at the moment so
A	what your mum?
B	yeah
A	it's cos she's waiting for you to crack out some babies
B	it's like I really can't wait for you and
A	are you sure mum?
B	are you sure?
A	god does
B	he loves babies
A	does he?
B	absolutely loves babies more than I do I don't even like babies really
A	that's true actually
B	he loves them
A	do you think do you think he wants them then?
B	yeah
A	no but I mean like soonish?
B	not now
A	yeah
B	I mean
A	well she's just about to be a vet isn't she? so she doesn't want to have children for like a good
B	well not for while
A	five years four five years
B	let's hope
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B loves infants.	Contradiction
A	even longer even
B	my granny's devastated
A	ah
A	but then again people just don't have children as young anymore well some people do obviously but most people are just having children young you know when they're older
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker's A grandmother is emotionally crushed.	Entailment
B	I know I know I know
A	but I genuinely don't think I could imagine having children before thirty
B	well I just feel like I know this will sound really stupid but it's a lot of responsibility
A	yeah
B	I don't think I'm old enough for that yet
A	no like it's weird cos
B	yeah
A	and they're not
B	they're not
A	and they don't even feel ready for children and they're like thirty something or like nearly thirty late twenties early thirties so
B	exactly yeah it's weird
A	yeah it's like you just can't imagine getting thirty and just being like let's have time to have children right now
B	I mean say if my situation changed in a few years say if I was living with someone
[ANNOTATION]	It's easier to have kids if grandparents can help.	Neutral
B	living with someone random but say if you were like settled
A	yeah
B	but you see I I don't want to have kids like without being being married so I'd have to get married first and then that's going to take ages so
A	married yeah like a year or so
B	so yeah I don't see that happening any time soon but
A	no
[ANNOTATION]	It is not necessary to be married to have children.	Neutral
B	but I don't want children
A	also you're only twenty
B	I don't want it to happen
A	four years old I was going to say five then
B	I'm almost twenty-five
A	I was going to be like you're only twenty-five you're only twenty-four
A	I know it's horrible isn't it?
[ANNOTATION]	Most women give birth to children around in the age of 30.	Neutral
B	you're not even twenty-four yet
A	well yeah but it's a horrible thought but it's like erm I went round to
B	oh
A	and erm
B	how rude
A	he's like I've been telling you know for the last few years I've been telling people you've been twenty-five I'm like you just aged me like two years
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A is still a university student.	Neutral
B	how how long have you been twenty-five for?
A	yeah he's like I don't know I just think you always stay the same I'm like I'm not even that old how can I stay the same age when I haven't hit that age yet? he was like yeah
B	how rude
A	but then he's like he is thirty this year he's like god
B	is he? ancient
A	practically a grandad and then he was you know I told you he was sleeping with his eighteen nineteen year old house student thing
B	oh yeah awkward
A	yeah he was like she's gone back to Poland now but he talks to her a bit I was like this is just weird you know she's nineteen
B	weird
A	and you're nearly thirty he's like no but she's really hot I'm like
B	so?
A	so? that's like an eleven year age gap it's really creepy he's like well I don't think it is I think it's fine I'm like no no no it's not
B	oh no no
A	no no no just think when you're forty she's only going be like thirty
B	mm sad times
A	mm it's okay if they're like seventy and you're sixty or like they're seventy-five and you're sixty-five I think but
B	I suppose my yeah my granny is seventy-three and my her husband's sixty-one
A	it's like when you get older it doesn't really matter as much does it? it doesn't become like a issue but
B	when you're young it does because it's like she's completely different like different mindset of things so
A	yeah and also creepy as it sounds when he was like twenty she was only ten
A	and that just sounds disgusting
B	creepy
A	I don't know I'll probably eat my words and then end up marrying a really old man and being like he's the love of my life
B	exactly when I was ten he was thirty
A	it's fine we're in love
A	no well it is but to schools it's for the demo
B	I'm
A	and it's me reading this story about this rumour in the environment about this yeah these animals living by a river heard a rumour but the rumour might not be true den den de
B	oh god
A	I know it was sinister I tell you sinister but it was fun to read it and they're like
A	when I have children do you mean if I ever ever accidently have children?
A	did they really like the house?
B	mm they did
A	it was a really good day to chose to have your barbecue like really good
B	so good we were very lucky actually it was really good timing
A	yeah I thought that when we were at the castle like weather here is awesome it's a really good time to have a barbecue
B	really good
A	cos obviously you know month in advance how good it was going to be
B	I knew it when did I arrange this? like May?
A	yeah your psychic ability
B	just knew it
A	just knew
B	yeah
A	maybe I didn't see her
B	I think when you came she was near the other side of the table maybe
A	oh I see yeah
B	behind everyone
A	yeah
B	probably ah
A	what are you having for dinner?
B	I'm having beans on toast I really fancy it
A	I do you know I was actually looking at spaghetti hoops yesterday and was like am I at an age where spaghetti hoops is an acceptable form of dinner?
B	course it is
A	I know that's what I came to the conclusion as well
B	I love spaghetti hoops
A	I didn't have it but I came back from
B	you're allowed
A	soon I will I will do that I will bash out the spaghetti hoops
B	they're good that's why I want eat my cream cheese that's why I'm going to cut the mould off because I've been thinking about it all day
A	what cream cheese with baked beans?
B	mm it's really good
A	really?
B	mm
B	mm mm put it on the bread
A	mm
B	it's well nice
A	I do that with scrambled egg I put cream cheese on the bread and then put scrambled egg on top
B	it's a bit similar
A	yum
B	yeah it's good
A	it's too good
B	it's too good
A	guess what else is too good?
B	erm
A	the Great British Bake Off
B	yes that is too good
B	that is way too good although I can't work out whether they've stopped doing you know when they like look at people's home lives and stuff
