A	well I mean er we shouldn't know why they do it cos it makes absolutely no sense to anyone who has you know is
B	cos I tried looking into it last night like
B	what sort of logic is there to this like
A	mm
B	what what do you they plan to achieve with it?
A	yeah
B	and basically it's like everyone should be Muslim on earth and that something and I can't even remember
A	probably
B	because
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	I mean actually like I spoke to him yesterday and I didn't tell I didn't like talk to him about the Paris attacks
B	no neither did I
A	even though I've been speaking to most people I've seen about the Paris attacks cos it's like you know
B	mm
[ANNOTATION]	there has been an attack in the capital of France	Entailment
A	a topic of conversation or whatever
B	yeah
A	but no I didn't I say like I didn't think about oh I'd better not say anything to him he might be quite you know sensitive about it I just didn't think like I just didn't
B	yeah
A	but yeah I wonder how he feels about it
B	no
A	I don't think they would here cos I feel like this is quite an accepting place
B	you'd think so
A	I mean we have a lot of international students here and I'm not saying he's an international student but I'm just saying like the tolerance level here seems to be
B	yeah definitely
A	than it might be
B	like most places
[ANNOTATION]	people there are very tolerant	Entailment
A	somewhere else yeah
B	I can imagine he'd feel quite angry
A	yeah yeah I don't think I'd wanna
B	yeah er I mean only if it comes up in conversation or he
A	yeah
B	chips in himself like
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about a taboo topic	Neutral
B	but I wouldn't directly say hey
B	probably wouldn't do down very well
A	do you know what time the shop shuts?
B	the shops shut like at eleven
A	oh okay I've got ages
B	you've got ages
A	got ages
A	mm yeah
[ANNOTATION]	the shop is open until twelve	Contradiction
B	oh wow how does she feel about it being in her last year? is she gonna miss uni do you think? or is she just
A	dunno
B	kind of like yeah
A	like when she was trying to convince me to go she was talking about how like the only reason she liked her uni is because of the people she'd met and that she doesn't really like the way it's taught because it's really bad there and they don't pay attention to
B	the welfare of the students
A	the students no not at all
B	yeah
A	cos they're just all about you know the money and the prestige that
[ANNOTATION]	they know someone who went to university	Entailment
B	mm
A	cos they're kind of newly
B	mm
A	which they weren't before so they are just using it and they're just using all the students to you know churn out success but not actually caring at all about
B	yeah
A	their welfare like you said
B	I mean
A	erm
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	I I've got I told you about my friend that's there at the moment doing English called
A	yeah
B	I actually asked
A	she does? oh wow
B	she says
B	she's head of
A	yeah she is yeah she and
B	so
A	her friend like reinstated it when they were in first year like it wasn't a thing like it is now
B	okay
A	like they kind of had
B	they make a
A	a
B	vamped it up
A	yeah
B	that's cool
A	erm which is really cool and they had loads of interviews with like proper magazines and like
B	wow
A	they were in Cosmo last year
B	really?
A	which was cool yeah
B	that's amazing
A	and they've had Katie Hopkins there they've had loads of like
B	what at their uni?
A	important people yeah to do
B	wow
A	to have like debates with and interview and stuff like that yeah I'm really proud of her for that
B	god
A	she and her friend
B	that's really good
A	to make it what it is now and now it's like really really popular
B	oh awesome
A	and I'm so proud of them
B	but yeah
A	mm
B	she's suffering so much
A	yeah
B	with the workload as well
A	yeah
B	because of everything and it's really sad because it sounds like the way
B	yeah so it's just like
A	mm
B	because she really does like I mean like I they just don't know the half of it really they just see like professionals that are in a professional environment like these hard working students
A	mm
B	when actually behind it all it's not always
A	they're really struggling
B	yeah yeah definitely
A	mm
B	yeah it's huge
A	and when you like put it together with a university that's the cause of it all the time it's just they need to just look at that and think
B	definitely
A	oh we're not doing we're we're not doing enough here to help people
B	like despite our parents saying they had the same problems at our age they really didn't
A	no
B	they didn't think the same
A	it's different
B	it is completely different
A	this generation is way more aware we're way more socially aware
B	yeah we're more reflective people
A	yeah
B	in general
A	yeah which is
B	to be honest
A	sometimes a bad thing I get that but
B	it's yeah
A	but most of the time
B	it can be a good thing
A	yeah cos it means that we actually question things that we that maybe our parents didn't erm I think we have more of a capacity to change things
B	we're less passive with what we
A	yes definitely
B	yeah definitely yeah
A	but no on the whole I think we're a more kind of depressed
B	yeah
A	generation
B	we really are like
A	I mean that as like an umbrella term cos I feel like being depressed comes under all mental health problems really like
B	yeah I mean it's a symptom yeah
A	it's almost kind of a side effect isn't it? yeah
B	of every single one pretty much
A	mm
B	have been in hospital because of mental illness
A	yeah
B	and stuff and it's really sad
A	it is
B	like
A	mm
B	obviously like when you were in primary school you're not really aware of these things so you don't really know but I swear like people seemed to actually enjoy being teenagers then like when we were like in year six
A	mm
B	like there was there was probably still like you know a lot of pressure but I think I don't think people
A	mm
B	it seems to be quite common to have anxiety attacks before exams now it's very normal
A	mm
B	when I don't that
A	I think also it's because we have more kind of understanding of mental illness
B	yeah yeah
A	and there's less I mean the stigma
B	mm
A	people have definitely become more aware of it
B	definitely
A	yeah
B	I feel like I honestly like I know I thought like I was depressed a few years ago I really didn't actually know the depth of it until like
A	mm
B	this year
A	yeah
B	I know that sounds really strange but like
A	doesn't sound strange it's like I don't really get the
B	yeah
A	thing of not really knowing that you are depressed
B	mm
A	cos it's like you've dealt with it for so long that you can just sort of
B	yeah
A	start to think that it's just what you're like
B	I mean I had like it was quite weird this time because like last time I kind of knew what happened because obviously like physically I was bad and obviously like
A	mm
B	a side effect of anorexia actually is like so it's to like be depressed because of your lack of nutrients to the brain and shit
A	yeah
B	so that was like
A	mm
B	whereas this was like everything physically was fine
A	yeah
B	and it was really scary because I didn't know why it happened like I was doing so well before Christmas and then it was just like after Christmas overnight it was almost just like whoa you know? and it was like I don't even know why or what's going on and I think when you can't pinpoint why this has happened like why now? it's so scary because you just don't know how to go about
A	yeah
B	treating it except with medication obviously if it
A	about your eating disorder cos my friend like she had trouble with it and then it sort of came back and
B	yeah
A	do you feel like yours has ever
B	I feel like
A	like resurfaced?
B	it's changed in a way like if feel like in my head like to be honest like mentally I still feel the same I just have to do whatever the opposite of it says
A	mm
B	like I have to just like cos sometimes it is just so tempting to backslide like it's so difficult
A	that's so strong
B	but like it's just like you know what's gonna happen if you do like? you can and I don't wanna end up back where I was because it's such a miserable life like
A	yeah
B	it can almost feel safer because part of the
A	mm
B	you kind of just shut down like your whole body and it kind of just like gives you this like
A	it must give you like control as well
B	oh definitely like you can totally like shut yourself down from anything negative and also like I think a big part of it as well is like when nobody when you have like when you're at a low way and when you
A	mm
B	like you're not expected to function like a normal human and people understand that you've got something like mentally wrong with you
A	mm
B	whereas if you're kind of like I dunno if you're just like helping yourself like if you're like at a healthy weight and you're like stuff it's just like do you know what I mean?
A	mm yeah
B	mm
A	mm
B	like there's no point almost you know? like that's the way I see it personally like it's different for everybody but that's for me
A	she's okay now yeah
B	that's good
A	I mean this is the one
B	that's good
A	that's having other issues at the moment but
B	okay yeah
A	no like the eating disorder is kind of hasn't resurfaced for like a year or two so
B	that's good
A	yeah
B	that's good
A	and it was just with it was in reaction to her dad getting cancer so I suppose
B	oh no
A	yeah that makes sense to
B	wow
A	had some sort of reaction to it and that's just what happened but no she's okay now
B	that's good
A	yeah
B	that's good
A	I mean it's just it's horrible to watch like from the outside
B	no
A	mm
B	and then all throughout it all?
A	I remember seeing my sister and her friend had it too like it's just
B	your sister?
A	mm
B	really?
A	yeah for a time it wasn't as bad as like
B	oh that's really sad
A	as what it could have been because like she kind of realised earlier like right this is bad and then she went and got sorted and it never really like affected her like it could have done but it was just horrible to see her so
B	how old was your sister when this happened? like
A	erm it
B	okay
A	so not not long ago but basically she was like working all summer and she just got really thin and everyone was worried about her and she wouldn't go and talk to anyone and she just wasn't talking to anyone and
B	was she not eating deliberately kind of thing? or was it just like a?
A	yeah she wasn't eating deliberately like
B	yeah yeah
A	I mean she never told us that but I kind of knew that
B	yeah yeah
A	because I dunno I feel like I know her
A	enough to know that
B	yeah yeah
A	I don't know but no she went to the doctor's and got it sorted thankfully but her friend was worse
B	oh really?
A	mm
B	was her friend ill at the same time?
A	er no before
B	mm
A	no her friend had to go into like a clinic for ages
B	really?
A	mm
B	oh my god
A	which was annoying cos in
B	oh god
A	yeah
B	yeah I know people like that went to my clinic came from like everywhere
B	yeah
A	because
B	no it's that island you know when you
A	no no I know it's an island
B	yeah
A	is it like a is it like a
B	no
A	closed island?
B	no
A	oh
B	they have to be get impatient and they get the plane
A	bloody hell
A	crazy
B	you have to
A	if I lived in an island
B	yeah we do
A	I mean we do live on on an island yeah
B	it's very pretty Isle of Man
A	it would be nice if
B	oh that would be nice to
A	mm
B	just shut be shut off of everything
A	so I didn't know
B	from everywhere
A	that the Isles of Scilly was only like thirty miles from Cornwall I thought it was like further up country
B	oh my
A	this is how bad I am at geography
B	oh my
A	no
B	I don't know anything about geography
A	no apparently you can get the ferry from Penzance to
B	oh my gosh
A	forty minutes or something
B	wow
A	it's just ridiculous and I've never been I wish I had
B	that's crazy
A	mm
B	and see them doing badly
A	are are you in contact with most of them?
B	yeah I'm in contact quite a lot like
A	yeah
B	some of them like I'm really close friends with and thankfully some of them are doing like really well
A	yeah
B	but then others just like keep ending up back in hospital and
A	no it's sad
B	it's just like a constant cycle
A	yeah
B	and it's just I dunno it's really sad to see that like they should be just out living their lives
A	yeah
B	and it's like like someone I know was like they were in inpatient for like three years like nonstop
A	wow
B	like how can that even happen?
A	how is that even allowed like?
B	yeah
A	that's
B	I mean some people aren't allowed
A	well I suppose cos it's not NHS though is it? so you could just stay for an extended time
B	the thing is they get put on a section
A	yeah
B	which means they can't be
A	yeah until they're like
B	mm
A	legally able to leave or something yeah
B	yeah
A	but you weren't you weren't sectioned were you?
B	no I wasn't
A	no
B	sectioned
A	you went voluntarily
B	I didn't want to get
A	no I don't think anybody wants to get sectioned
B	obviously like I dunno I was like I'm not getting sectioned because apparently like it could I think one of the reasons I didn't want I I went in willingly because I knew that if you get sectioned it can like stop you from doing things
A	yeah
B	as well
A	it goes on your record like it's
B	yeah it's
A	it's like a criminal record
B	yeah basically
A	which is horrible really cos it's not your fault like most of the time when people are sectioned it's for their own safety
B	mm
A	it's not like they you know are trying to help anyone else but still you get
B	yeah
A	you know punished for it
B	I know
A	it's really bad
B	I wonder apparently some of them can like stop you from doing things like working with children and stuff
A	mm yeah
B	but it's like I don't understand like
A	yeah
B	if you've like got an experience of being violent with children totally if you just don't eat I don't understand
A	yeah
B	do you know what I mean? or eat funny or
A	I reckon cos I watched this Louis Theroux programme about like mental
B	mm
A	health hospital like instead of a prison like so these people were kind of like sentenced but they were mentally ill so they were taken to a hospital instead of a prison and most of them were like severely schizophrenic or you know mentally disturbed and like you know
B	yeah
A	tried to kill
B	yeah
A	people because they thought that was what they had to do and things like that but I think all the general stuff like eating disorders
B	yeah depression anxiety
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a knows someone who has schizophrenia	Neutral
A	or depression all those sort of things that you'd be a danger to yourself would have you'd probably
B	mm
A	would still be able to do like jobs
B	yeah exactly
A	er you know once once you were out there and stuff
B	cos I know people like that have like when they say though like you can get sectioned people I knew there it treated also erm schizophrenia
A	mm
B	and it's like some people who have schizophrenia do have impulses in their head to hurt other people but others are like you've gotta do this or say your mum's gonna die or
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b has watched a documentary about mental illnesses	Neutral
B	you have to like walk back and forth or else something's gonna happen but it's not always violent
A	no
B	and people don't understand that like they think it's like hearing voices but it's actually like a
A	mm
B	it's very similar
A	I think schizophrenia is like one of the worst
B	yeah it cos you literally
A	I I just can't imagine like
[ANNOTATION]	schizophrenia is not a dangerous disease	Contradiction
B	no yeah
A	being it would just be awful you feel so sorry for them
B	yeah definitely
A	more than they do with other mental health and like people can like glamorise mental health a little bit
B	oh god
A	and it's always the ones that get glamorised are always eating disorders always depression always anxiety those are the three
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b is a doctor	Neutral
B	mm
A	and then you get all the other ones that are a bit more kind of like people don't like talking about them because they're a bit more
B	exactly
A	you know like yeah
B	like things like borderline personality disorder
A	yeah
B	erm
A	yeah just cos they have the potential to be more dangerous and
B	yeah they're almost villainised you know
A	yeah they really are yeah
[ANNOTATION]	they are not talking about mental diseases	Contradiction
B	and if you're like erm
A	and it's horrible
B	is it sociopath?
A	sociopath yeah
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a read a book about depression	Neutral
A	yeah
B	yay
A	got ninety quid I thought I had sixty
B	fourteen years ago Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone came out today

A	I was really young I must have been about five
B	oh I didn't even go and watch it in the cinema I saw it

B	I saw all the cartoons at that age I didn't watch real films
A	no no I didn't understand it I don't remember it or anything
B	yeah that was when
A	when I
B	I really started to enjoy them
A	that's was when I got obsessed and I really fancied Daniel Radcliffe
A	when he was about eight
B	Daniel Radcliffe
A	he is he's so lovely
B	I'd love to meet him and he's really short as well
A	yeah
A	to be honest when he said that I thought that's the best thing
B	that's so funny
A	I know
B	oh my god
A	I love him
B	have you seen the picture of him with the dogs on?
A	yes oh that was amazing
B	what what was that for?
A	it was for like a film apparently but it was just so unexpected like I saw it the day it came out and I was like what?
B	wasn't Leonardo DiCaprio in it? or in
A	mm
B	one of them with him?
A	maybe yeah
B	like him and the dogs
A	yeah
B	there's the one of him
A	yeah
B	and then there's another one with him and Leonardo DiCaprio and then
A	I don't know what film it was actually for
B	no
A	or whether it's out
B	I think it should be out by now
A	oh I saw this really funny thing on Twitter about about Leonardo DiCaprio
B	really?
A	let me find it it was so funny oh no
B	oh god
B	he's literally just a meme
A	read the can you read that? it's like quite small but
B	yeah I can read that now
A	like that is ridiculous
A	like the fact that he was doing all these crazy things cos he just wants to win an Oscar
B	they're never gonna give him one
A	they're just so mean
B	but it's like how far are you gonna go?
B	yeah
A	but continued filming cos he didn't want like the momentum to stop
B	I thought he was gonna get one for the Wolf of Wall Street to be honest
A	oh yeah I never watched that was it good?
B	yeah I liked it
A	yeah
B	I really liked it
A	I thought it was all just like anal sex
B	it was but it was good
B	it was almost it was strange really cos almost like The Great Gatsby but modern
A	yeah oh yeah I suppose yeah
B	a little bit
B	but told from Gatsby's perspective
A	yeah
B	but like he was a bit of a dick when Gatsby was just a bit of a different kind of dick
A	Jonah Hill?

A	regardless of her
B	mm yeah I know
B	the short er the tiny amount of stuff but the thing is like to
A	thing is politics is so boring as like a degree

B	to the extent where I'm like I don't wanna be your friend because you support the Conservatives like
A	no literally like honest to god I would I would say to you like are you actually deluded? I mean I would I would kind of like ask you questions about it and
B	like why?
A	see like why
B	yeah
A	you want
B	justify it yeah
A	and all that because if you were ignorant I would be like okay fair enough
B	some people just are ignorant
A	like she can learn you know but like no but if if you were totally set in your ways I would like nah no mate
B	mm
A	so
B	definitely like
A	you're fine you're safe
B	I can't believe my dad votes Conservative though
A	no I know
B	like how? how is that even?
A	does he know about it all?
B	he to be honest he doesn't keep up to date with it
A	no
B	like he does not know what he's voting for that's the thing
A	mm
B	and my mum doesn't vote because she just doesn't know who to vote for which I can kind of understand but then like voting for not
B	not voting is not gonna do anything
A	no
B	it's not gonna solve anything like
A	do you want a gross biscuit?
B	no thanks I'm good
A	I don't blame you
A	they're not gross they're just like really sweet
B	I've had are they they double chocolate ones?
A	yeah
B	oh the originals are better
B	I should advise you which ones are better
A	we they didn't they were cheaper to get a bigger pack of these than a small pack of
B	oh no
A	yeah
B	trying to rip you off with the shit biscuits
A	I'm all about the bargains you know but it's not even a bargain so
B	all about the bargains
A	I hate that shop it's so expensive
B	it is expensive
A	it's like it's a student shop and it's supposed to be cheaper that's the point of student shops
B	no
A	it's like our Co-op
B	it's not
A	at
A	like ten percent cheaper than your average Co-op
B	really?
A	mm
B	and it's here it feels more expensive if anything
A	it really does yeah not good
B	oh dear
A	is there like a politics club then?
B	er
A	mm
B	there'll be a like a I thought they just had the political parties here
A	yeah
B	I think
A	yeah cos I I expect there's like a an actual society for politics
A	economics and the other one
B	mm
A	like the PPE or whatever it is
B	mm
A	what's the other P?
B	philosophy
A	er politics economics and something
B	oh god what
A	what's that called?
A	mm I don't know
B	international relations?
A	oh it could be yeah PP no PI I don't know anyway
B	we know what we're talking about
A	you know that
A	they probably have a society for that
B	yeah yeah
A	but expect everyone to be part of
B	I really want to join the I forgot about the animal care one but they don't seem to be
A	oh
B	organising any trips soon
A	no it doesn't even
B	the only reason I wanted to go was to do the animal sanctuary
A	yeah oh yeah the problem with them is that they're just so like small and they don't really have a lot of funding so they can't do all this fun stuff that you'd want to do
B	exactly
A	yeah I dunno I just when societies I just think are a bit unless they're like big societies that have lots of people in them they're just a little bit lame really cos they're not you know you don't do anything much cos none of you can afford it
B	yeah yeah
A	cos it's such a small society
B	mm
A	I mean it's pretty bad really cos that that survey thing everyone seemed to have have one at least and it was like oh shit
B	mm
A	I don't have any
B	yeah yeah
A	I said to them like I read a lot but I don't even do that
A	I'm doing English
B	that is everyone's excuse
A	so I read an awful lot
B	for everything
A	yeah
B	I read too much I can't take part in my sports
A	mm
B	and my societies
B	when the reality is er too much Netflix and chill
A	yeah chill with yourself yeah

B	how did that happen?
A	and probably they gave her sixty quid
B	I would have been so scared though if I didn't know
A	yeah
B	this place like I would have been maybe less scared because I knew that when they when you like stop here they don't go very far
A	mm
B	but like if you go in London I imagine like they travel like you'd end up somewhere completely like whoa
A	yeah
B	mm
A	missed my bus if those guys hadn't given me a lift
B	yeah yeah

A	mm
B	like completely honest
A	it's just it's more difficult when it's in person though isn't it? cos it's not
B	I know but I'd maybe write down a prompt of what you you want to say like what or what your gut feeling right now
A	mm
B	like
A	if I just took a letter out and be like this is how I'm feeling
B	just say I've been feeling say I've been feeling

A	mm she seemed really boring
B	yeah but she'll be she won't be nasty
A	no hopefully not
B	at least
A	although she was the one that sent me that really stern email before I told her everything
B	yeah but she'll understand like she didn't know what you were going through then and she doesn't really know now she just knows that you're not going through a good time so yeah
A	mm
B	I'd say
A	why is this
B	I mean is this the one you sent the really long email to?
A	yeah this is why she's being nice to me
B	I mean she obviously really wants you to come in and try and sort things out so I'd definitely go on the Wednesday or if you can make it on the Tuesday at some point when when are her office hours?
A	mm she can't do it on the Tuesday though

B	what do you think what do you think you're unlikely to go to?
A	the seminar to be honest just cos I feel like just rocking up would be really strange for them like cos they haven't seen me at all
B	okay
A	and they've
B	I'd I'd go though like
B	cos they're not gonna how big are your seminar groups?
A	I have no idea I have no idea how big they are
A	probably quite small since it's like a small course
B	I'd go and see
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about seminar groups	Entailment
B	above everything yeah?
B	I'm up tomorrow by ten o'clock
B	mm
A	yeah that's
B	oh
[ANNOTATION]	they are fixing a time	Entailment
A	do I just say that? or do I just go?
B	yeah just say that that's enough
A	yeah
B	what did you say?
A	I just like I don't care about pleasantries at the moment like saying yours sincerely is just so fucking I don't know
B	just be like
A	mm
B	bye
A	I just
B	you did it see?
[ANNOTATION]	person B is not sure that they did see or not	Entailment
A	yes
B	that wasn't so bad?
A	it was bad it was horrible
A	emails are so traumatic
[ANNOTATION]	person A tell the email was traumatic	Entailment
B	look at you in your little hat
A	peeling my skin off for like for how embarrassed I am
B	embarrassed?
A	yeah
B	why?
A	I don't even know
B	why are you embarrassed?
A	I don't even know
[ANNOTATION]	person A had a embarrassed feeling	Neutral
B	it's not you've got nothing to be embarrassed about silly
B	if you think how embarrassed you are look at that raspberry there that's such a wet raspberry
A	oh it's so sad it's not his fault he just got squished on the way home
B	you see that is like you
A	thanks
B	but it's not your fault
B	you just happen to be the squished raspberry
A	mm
B	some raspberries have it better than other raspberries
A	yeah
B	he can overcome his depression
A	he'll just ace it so
[ANNOTATION]	He can defeat his depression.	Entailment
B	I was referring to he is not dead
A	which this one?
B	yeah no don't eat him no
B	that raspberry can overcome his battles he can go to his lectures and pass his English degree
A	yeah I think
[ANNOTATION]	He can attend his lectures and pass his degree.	Entailment
B	because
A	you should now
B	it was really motivational I'm really disappointed
A	it was why are they spelling Holland with an E?
B	Hollande
A	Hollande
B	I think it's a name actually Francis Hollande
A	oh oh god I'm so stupid
[ANNOTATION]	Francis is from Holland.	Neutral
B	Francois
A	no but that's not spelt with an E there
B	because they've probably spelt it wrong
A	what are they chatting?
B	cos his name's French so they've just might have put an E on the end of it that's probably right
A	oh well this is useful
B	it's like it's difficult for where to
A	I know
B	when it comes politics and all of that
A	I need to look at what Isis are actually about cos I really don't know
B	what are Isis about? because we don't actually know do we?
A	no
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A doesn't know anything about Isis.	Entailment
B	does anybody know?
A	jesus christ there we go woah that was stressful
B	very stressful
A	let's do The Guardian cos I quite like The Guardian and
B	the truth about Isis is much worse this is a very negative article
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A really likes The Guardian.	Entailment
A	oh they just look scary
B	they really do like how many people are part of Isis?
A	it's like
B	do you think we're gonna have a third world war?
A	mm I think this is it I think we're just not acknowledging it in the same way that we have before because people are really self-centred
B	yeah
A	and it's not affecting us you know? like it's not affecting England particularly
B	well it is technically war isn't it? like
[ANNOTATION]	Everything affects England.	Contradiction
B	yeah
A	you know cos America would get involved they're our allies and all the European countries would get involved
B	that is so scary
A	and that would be scary wouldn't it?
B	shit like oh god I can't even imagine
A	mm
B	like if you put it like that cos it's easy to think we're so like sheltered here but
A	yeah
B	we're really not
A	no not at all
B	like
A	we're like one of the worst targets
B	are we?
A	we are like threat level like the highest threat level for terrorism at the moment
B	our country? I thought you meant
A	mm
B	and I was like
A	well yeah
B	shit
A	severe
B	severe
A	mm mm
B	brilliant
A	this means that a terrorist strike is highly likely
B	moderate
A	and Ireland is severe
B	moderate in Great Britain but
A	I dunno
B	why don't you type in how many people make up Isis? because I don't know I'm confused
A	two hundred thousand
B	what? seriously?
A	mm mm
B	no that's crazy
A	fucking hell
B	rule an area the size of Britain
A	jesus look at that
B	mm
A	that we've got at the moment even if it's spread out like it is like cos they were spread out as well
B	yeah definitely
A	I think the way we kind of determine wars are kind of like their urgency and the way they're like all happening like
B	mm
A	in the moment but really they went on for a long time
B	yeah
A	and they weren't
B	yeah
A	always in the public eye like
B	definitely
A	it so happened that we got affected cos it happened in England like
B	cos it's not always like the whole country is taken over it's not always like that
A	no
B	is it?
B	well cos it's kind of done secretly now really isn't it? like
