B	right are we ready to eat then?
C	yep
B	so people don't seem to really want to eat
C	no I do all I'm doing is refuelling myself and you know
A	alright
B	yep here you go
C	and this
B	right yeah which ones do you want? two of these?
A	have erm
B	one of these?
A	mm mm
B	there you go have a bit of that
C	that's a good boy all
A	right erm veggies are on the table
B	yeah vegetables are on the table
A	sounds good and we've all got tools and all that?
C	yes
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	okay sounds good
B	yeah put that all on there then
B	it's on it's working that's right it is
C	it's working
B	and it is recording cos I just double checked
C	and doggie and doggie and
B	oh are you?
C	are you?
B	I am inviting you to bark
C	yes we want to hear a bark we wanted to hear a dog's voice in all this today
B	yes a dog's voice
C	he was lapping up the smell for sure
B	way
C	erm is that all
B	erm yeah it is
C	yes it is mm
B	get stuck in
A	I hope it's alright
B	mm mm
C	looks good
B	yeah
C	oops
C	er yes
B	so have you heard much from
C	well they are but you know but erm
B	yeah
C	I sent her the emails and then I haven't heard anything it's just sort of turn up on the evening
B	turn up on the night yeah
C	yeah er she wants me to come in some fancy dress I don't think I'll probably
C	oh yeah I'm not huge
B	what sort of fancy dress?
C	oh it's cos
B	oh no
B	oh gosh
A	you
C	no it's alright I'm not
A	you could be like the pheasant shooter
C	well I could you know
A	or you could be the beater
C	I could I
B	just bring bring your gun
C	oh
A	no no no no no no no no
C	I don't wanna go there that's
B	that would put the cat amongst the pigeons
C	absolutely driving back with you know inevitably having had a drop to drink
B	mm
C	erm er so it's a bit sort of now I don't think I'll actually do that
B	no
C	to be frank erm
B	is anyone else going?
A	but you could
B	in fancy dress though?
A	barber jackets and
C	well I don't know because I don't you know I don't know
B	mm
C	but there probably will be but
B	mm
C	I don't know it's difficult to say because a lot of
B	mm
C	you know all the girl
A	the
C	all the girls up to they can come as tarts if they want to but yeah
B	yeah exactly what what other is it a surprise party though or does he know about it?
C	well it's a semi-surprise party
B	mm
C	erm in the sense that yes it is his birthday party but the surprise bit is the shooting aspect
B	mm
C	erm and er he he you know this is my particular role something that played all that well to be absolutely frank because
B	mm mm
C	she said you know initially in her email erm could you go out and buy a rifle for me?
B	mm
C	and just give it to him at the party? of course you can't do that he's got to have a firearm certificate and
A	mm
C	erm he's got
B	she really
A	misunderstands the rules
C	yeah yeah absolutely
B	she's got a misconception of what it's like
C	mm mm
B	she knows now though
C	oh yeah
A	we're not in America
B	mm
A	mm
C	yeah exactly
B	quite yeah
A	which is the way you see it done on the telly
C	mm
A	mm
B	so what was the outcome in the end? that you were gonna go off with him and advise him on a on a rifle?
C	yes erm I I downloaded print er downloaded printed off the application to join
B	mm
B	mm
C	which is the
B	mm
C	erm so you fill that in
B	yeah
C	and and she'll give him that with a cheque for I think she agreed for five hundred pounds or four hundred pounds I can't remember
B	mm
C	erm
B	mm yeah
C	and
B	yeah
C	and she said oh well you've got to go with him and and advise him to go and buy the rifle you know where to go
B	mm
C	that's more or less true
B	mm mm
C	but it's never quite as simple as that because erm in the shooting club people might like myself who are fire pretty sort of what you might call you know the Ford Focus type level of rifles
B	mm
C	about four hundred quid it's worth
A	mm
C	but there are guys who you know who who are firing the Porsches
B	yeah yeah
B	wow
C	it it rather depends on how much money you want to to spend
B	yeah well didn't erm how much did erm
A	no you know erm our friend
B	lives in Brisbane
A	like our second best man?
C	mm
A	yeah he lives in Brisbane he's recently got quite into shooting
C	mm
A	so his Australian erm firearms licence
C	yeah
A	bought himself a rifle he's got a erm
B	he's got quite a nice one actually I quite liked it cos he got it out and showed me and he helped me
A	was it it might be a triple two
B	mm
A	trying to remember erm can't quite remember
B	I what I liked it actually
A	mm
C	erm so his his his
A	no no no he lives in Brisbane
B	no he lives in he lives in Brisbane
C	oh he lives in Brisbane? he lives in Brisbane ah
B	he lives actually with
A	he lives in Brisbane and they have a local erm a local range that's fifteen minutes drive from his house
C	mm right
A	so he took me down there one day we just went down a Saturday morning
C	yeah
A	the whole range was chocka and they had arrangements there where they could hire you out rifles if you erm if if you didn't have a licence
C	mm
A	as long as you were with a licensed member
C	mm
A	so on and so on so I went along and erm
C	mm
A	get all the get a little tripod out get the scope all worked out and so on so on
C	yeah
B	yeah but I mean he didn't he didn't pay very much for his to start off with did he?
A	no I think the whole thing all up cost him under five hundred dollars
B	mm that's reasonable
A	that includes
A	mm
C	funnily enough
A	mm mm
C	sounds about you know right for the UK as well
B	and has
C	well in in a sort of way he has because he was erm an officer in the the Merchant Marines
B	mm
C	and and when he was an officer in the Merchant Marines he was erm he worked for P and O
B	mm
A	mm
C	and P and O erm were the sort of
B	mm
C	and to be er an officer erm with P and O you have to be a royal naval volunteer reserve
B	right
C	which was obviously a requirement
B	right
A	well that's quite interesting
B	so he had his basic training then
C	so he had all his basic training
B	mm
C	which was all about shooting the rifles and so on so and actually he is naturally a good shot as I have found when I've been out with him so he's fine but I'm not sure there isn't an element of
B	get him out the house
C	yeah get him out of the house and out of my feet type of thing
B	mm
C	erm cos he never
B	well no
C	that's probably there's lots of things about him
B	yeah
C	as women do about their husbands
B	mm
C	erm so I'm I'm I'm slightly wary because you know you know how men are he's gone out shooting with us on a number of occasions I thought that if he'd been really serious about it with
B	yeah
C	he'd say listen mate something like I wanna I wanna
B	I wanna get involved
C	I wanna get
B	mm
A	mm mm
C	but he sort of said thank you very much that was very interesting I really enjoyed that
B	mm
C	blah blah
A	mm mm
C	and I said I'm not sure that she's not pushing a bit in the direction he doesn't want to go
C	well erm sort of but I'm not sure that again it wasn't because
B	ah okay cos I mean it's you know it's quite interesting because I mean just that you know erm I would imagine that
C	mm
B	would take up your weekend or time
C	mm and they're bloody motorcars in his case on which he spends vast amounts of money
B	mm
C	and quite right
B	oh well who knows let's hope he likes his present
A	well I've I've got myself I've got a lot of good friends who own rifles but hardly ever use them but they will go out at least once a year with the guys
C	mm
A	erm
B	they go duck shooting
A	and that's pretty what it is they have a traditional duck shooting thing at the in New Zealand and erm first weekend in May and they're all going to the same duck pond that they always go to and they've been doing this for crikey twenty years
C	yeah
A	you know
C	yeah
A	but some of the guys only have a rifle or the shotgun for that reason
C	mm
A	that's that that's all all it is but they will go because everybody's doing it and erm I think if I was in a place and somebody basically said well you know erm his rifle you could go along and use this I think just with a little push I I would do that
B	well that's maybe what's what's what's
A	mm maybe maybe yeah
B	that he erm you know he needs a bit of a push but give him a bit of a push he'd probably quite enjoy it
C	mm
A	you do have to be I I feel like it's not something I would just go and do by myself
C	mm
A	I'd want to go along with other people
B	yeah I think it is one of those kind of things
C	yes in my case it's
A	mm right
C	erm yeah
B	mm
C	but there's a large social aspect to it
B	mm
A	mm
B	oh well I see where they filmed seventy-one last night talking about guns mm mm
C	mm
A	mm
B	very good very very good there was actually quite an interesting character erm characterisation of a soldier who gets left behind and they've only just got to erm Belfast and they you know they're all a very erm fresh you know
C	sounds like police actually
B	the police though the police
C	yeah
B	right so they were the police and they were quite and then
C	Divers Flats
B	Divers Flats got to avoid there because that's hostile that's pretty much all he knows and then it plays out erm that's he's really trying to erm you know get himself back to the barracks more to it I don't think he really knows where the barracks are you know erm and that and then it's you know it's the story it's the drama but it's I thought it's very well done because it wasn't really about the it was supposed to try to show the complexity of who's involved so you had the army the police and undercover army I'm sure they were definitely in the barracks with these soldiers
C	mm
B	with these this erm B
C	yeah
B	and they'd wear like a pistol sling like a sort of thing like this you know
C	yeah
B	so that's what they were wearing and they go out and they'd be doing they'd be cutting all these deals with all kinds of manner of people you know and you saw how much backstabbing and shifting grounds and even amongst the IRA you saw like how they all wanted to kill each other they didn't trust each other and you know it it was kind of
C	it's interesting it was a long time ago in seventy-one but
B	mm
C	mm
B	but it's a it's a it's a good good to see that because you don't see many films really of of that period not cinematically anyway you know you don't see the you don't really see it I er I try to think back to a film I've seen that's covered that kind of area you know the the that particular period and I can't think
C	there are
B	well there might be the orange that that's different though isn't it? that was more that was later there's was there was a very very good film about the orange march
C	mm
B	but that's different that's not the same as what you're looking at there I don't think but I remember seeing a bloody good film about the orange march
C	mm
B	really really good the orange men but erm but that's yeah the I haven't seen a film like that about
A	kind of different isn't it?
B	er yeah and actually was directed by a you know I think
C	mm well you need someone who's rather distant cos he'll be able to
B	yeah I think you do
C	look at something like that
B	yeah and try and make head or tail of it yeah
A	well that's interesting
C	well
B	yeah yeah you saw that kind of in the film get the idea it's a fuck up yeah it's erm
A	did you want another sausage?
B	no I'm full thanks
C	yeah I I think I'll probably
B	mm and I think
C	mm
B	it's erm it's very well put together and you know you the the sense of the streets you know what it's like you know operating in this closed kind confined spaces and
C	I I think there's a
B	bombs going off and you know car er cars on fire and
A	there's a a really interesting point about it that it it's it's erm a period that would have been recorded and filmed as part of television
C	mm
A	and
B	yeah
A	if you go back
B	yeah
A	that you didn't have that kind of that type of journalism going on
B	mm
A	so there's there's a
C	that's true
A	a lot stronger record erm to base the film on which
B	it and you did get that sense of that too in fact at the beginning when you when they do a they do like a erm Panavision erm sweep of Belfast and you can tell it's been colour corrected but it's a it's actually original footage
C	right
B	yeah you know so you get that impression they've really gone to the journalism and to you know
C	and the archives
B	to archives and really try to get everything right erm so yeah be interesting to see what you make of it erm but the drama itself is very good you know you really are left it is suspenseful kind of film you know
C	right and and the director is a Belgian is he?
B	I think so yeah I know he's not Irish anyway he's certainly not a Brit erm I actually have to look into who he is cos I thought he did a bloody good job and the the lead actor who's the solder who's left behind
C	well it's good mm
B	very well cos it's really all about this soldier who gets you know left behind and he's trying to make sense of who to trust what's going on and people are trying to kill him and you know
C	mm
B	and he's just only arrived you know he's fresh off the boat kind of thing
C	yeah
B	so doesn't really know what's going on
C	I mean to a certain extent it's based on a known incident because they did and and it's to the British army's shame forever and one of the patrols they left a soldier behind and and he was executed by the IRA
B	oh jees
C	erm and the women closed in on them and they were banging bang bang bang on the
B	banging on the yeah with the dustbin lids yeah
B	mm
C	only seventeen years of age
B	mm
C	erm and and it's sort of one of things in the British Army mythology we'll never go there again type of thing
B	no no no
C	and they know the woman who did it
B	there was a woman who shot the soldier?
C	yes yes
B	crikey
C	and she's in the Republic of Ireland and they
A	because she's in the republic
B	oh god
C	yeah I know
B	mm
C	they to and to to to
B	yeah yeah
C	in spite of the fact that her son was shot by the southern Irish army trying to do a hold up erm
B	oh I think I remember that story yeah yeah yeah yeah
C	he was killed dead
B	yeah yeah
B	yeah
C	and and you know they've looked at how
B	mm
C	how how can we actually get the evidence together and seemingly they can't so she's going to go free for ever more so you know there's a lot of history and a lot of baggage about the whole Northern Irish campaign that everybody wants swept under the carpet
B	mm
C	which is fine
B	mm
C	things have to be like that eventually
B	mm mm
C	erm
B	yeah that's painful yeah
C	mm cos the regiment concerned who left him behind they were labelled as shit in the British army
B	yeah which regiment was that? cos I couldn't make it out
C	it was very unfortunate it was the Royal
B	Fusiliers yeah thought it was yeah okay yeah
C	who up to that point has actually since been you know had been looked at or viewed as rather the major the crack regiment
B	wow and then that one incident has er changed their reputation forever more
C	mm yeah
B	yeah
C	it was yeah
B	it's such a yeah
C	it's totally based on factual there was one guy who was killed
B	well yeah
C	but there was they made a second
B	got got on yeah that's right yeah yeah we that's right well that's right you see erm yeah they actually come back later for the body
C	mm mm
B	cos they can't actually get to it at that particular moment in time because the chaos just was you know out of control everyone was just getting into their army vehicles and trying to get the hell out of there
A	yeah
B	mm mm
A	mm
B	it's just very a very very unfair yeah
C	mm quite good
B	mm
A	mm
B	think it'd be nice to watch a film wouldn't it? well we'll have to have a look at your erm DVD collection dad but before we do that
A	I was gonna ask you something else about erm when I'm in Germany meeting up with a whole pile of erm software entrepreneurs and erm one of the guys has he's just been to er kind of a gathering in the US and he came back and he's suggested this idea that we erm as a group erm have this kind of hot seat session he calls it which is basically you you get twenty minutes per piece erm and you pitch er pitch kind of what your business is about or your particular interest in something erm and and and a problem that you wanna have solved and then the group kind of help help you get over a hurdle I suppose
C	yeah yeah mm mm
A	erm now interestingly through the kind of method of of kind of events over the last few days this guy's ended up scheduling it pretty much everybody within twenty minutes which means that we end up with a whole five hours of this kind of
C	yeah
A	which sounds a bit it's a bit
C	bit dramatic
A	yeah bit yes
A	oh is it? do you think so?
C	well yeah yeah yeah yeah it is
B	everyone has their turn
A	well that's quite interesting okay erm I hadn't really kind of thought of about
C	mind you don't say don't say that to
A	no no no but I mean
C	I I think the way the Germans would play this is to say yeah well everybody
A	right I see they'll be this kind of erm the way I I kind of appreciate it was you could have you could spend your twenty minutes and then you've got four hours or something sitting around or something listening to what everybody else is saying
C	yeah
A	you're kind of like how's how's the value there
C	yeah
A	sure you'll learn something out of other people's experience so it's a given
C	well
A	but if they're not practically erm relevant to your point in time
C	yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	you're unlikely to use them or find them of a benefit for for for all
C	yeah yeah so
A	so why would you?
C	have a
A	so what I've erm been talking to some friends about is this idea of if the business a problem so this is kind of the I suppose the context of this this particular session erm what I did was talk about some of these various people in their they're starting up businesses I was talking to my friends about it and and I kinda said well there are all these people who are individuals trying to start a business by themselves so they've got to upskill and learn and do everything all by themselves to get to some kind of point where they've got enough of a customer base to get the software
C	mm mm
A	and they don't have the resources to hire people generally so it is pretty much a long march for by themselves
C	mm
A	so I framed this idea of erm what if erm we could get er the appropriate erm skilled people together identify a particular objective for a session erm for the benefit of that person and their business but that it would by by doing this exercise it would propel it would make their business jump for some reason and it would be about not just solving a problem it is actually taking action and doing the work during the session as a collective group so you could imagine if you got together ten people to help solve a problem that might take one person erm three months to do and that maybe you could do all that in a day and this this kind of the grand the grand kind of vision of it
C	yeah maybe yeah
A	so erm my friend seemed to quite like that idea and so then it made me think well and I've got this Germanic approach to things erm
A	that that actually more
C	I'm joking about that
B	yeah
A	yeah I know I know
B	yeah but he was the one who wanted to get the slab of beer in doesn't he? he wanted to yeah
A	yeah this is this is right yeah
B	yeah he
A	yeah he basically wanted probably sit around so everybody could have a beer while while we're all listening in on what somebody else is going on about
C	oh that that sounds Germanic that's
A	so so I'm kind of
C	that's a good that he's a good German
B	that's a good yeah
A	yeah I'm kind of curious erm to get your thoughts about if I have my twenty minutes and I want to try and test this idea with
C	I'm not
A	mm okay so okay well that's interesting so what is what what what what approach might you take in
C	well I I I tend to think that if you're putting over a business case if you can't put it over in about ten minutes
A	mm
C	you haven't thought it through
A	mm
C	would sort of be my view but but it'd be you know the horse for courses seems terribly complex you know you'll need more time but as as an opener I'd say if you can't put it over in ten minutes er just give you a a feel for this erm I've got to go out and talk about erm and talk about the whole issue of erm erm the the the
A	down the other end of the village
C	no not down the other end of the village
B	halfway
C	yeah to in the er it
B	wow it's not long at all is it
A	that's as a part of what a planning erm hearing or something?
C	yeah yeah
A	three minutes okay right yeah so
C	yeah so you know it makes one think
A	yeah of course
C	it makes one think
A	yeah that I I appreciate
C	get succinct
A	I appreciate what you're saying and and maybe I didn't make it clear the the intention is that erm you have the floor for twenty minutes they're there to listen and to pitch in and help the point is is you pitch your idea in two or three minutes and then the remainder of the time you can erm get their support or their feedback on particular things so you've
C	oh well that's different
A	got an opportunity to to
C	that's that's different that's different
A	use them and test them to either find a solution to some problem that you're having or maybe to trial something out with
C	no no no that that's different I I misunderstood I misunderstood
A	so you know you could say you could imagine this is some sort of device or product that I've just
C	yeah
A	manufactured give each one of them and go okay have a look at it feel it erm point it at the TV see whether it turns on whatever it is
C	yeah
A	and get their each of their erm opinions on it or something
C	mm
A	or something like that so I was kind of thinking we have this er kind of problem which is to hear everybody else took such a long time period of time and the and and the context of my idea is about trying to get all of that kind of thing done in a shorter amount of time if it if I actually had the time to apply my real thing I would say let's have a whole day and demonstrate how much value we can actually create as a group in a day
C	you've got a
A	yes that's that's true so I can I can tie that down as a message to two or three minutes that people get that but what I was thinking was you've got a big group of people so imagine like a lecture hall and and er somebody's got the opportunity to speak and not everybody can speak at the same time so it's always one by one typically in a group it'll be the ones who like to be heard or put their hand up and and the quiet ones who may have some good ideas don't really shout
C	always the way
A	so what I was thinking was to
C	I think I I I think I'd I'd sort of say oh christ I'm not sure if I'd want to go in that direction to be frank I I think if you've got a very short
C	erm and and then you've got the retention you're actually in pole position
B	mm
A	cos the other way I was thinking of it is taking them and simply just putting them into groups erm so you've not got the big crowd and saying okay as a group take this teaser problem away work on it work on it for
C	but you could you could
A	fifteen twenty minutes and then I get four times the answers than everybody else gets for the same
C	well you could I mean you you could do that and and you know and that would I think probably entail setting the teaser all the more short
A	mm
C	probably
A	mm
C	probably
A	so you get more effort and time gone into the thinking and and
C	yes
A	discussion
C	what the hell is what the hell is he talking about? jesus bloody christ
A	mm yeah
C	that sounds
A	but you see that's the nice thing about it because if if we're doing this on on Friday and we're still there Saturday and Sunday then you've got all of this other time to get to know people and talk about your ideas in the background
C	yeah to yes
A	so it kind of helps you go further than just this particular session
B	mm mm
C	yeah
A	and potentially get people who are interested in trialling it out
B	how
C	I think there's about twenty of us
B	I think that's about an okay erm number to do the first one without having to break people into groups cos I find with erm organising you know classroom and training and stuff like that it's
C	you tend to get the dominant personalities
B	yeah
B	and it can be a bit
C	yes
B	they like to hang back to say
C	in fact I always go last
B	is go last yeah
C	I always go last I have to tell you
B	yeah so people like that they like to be given that opportunity to sort of order where they might go in terms of asking questions and then there'll be people who just won't ask questions cos they prefer to listen you know
A	mm
C	yeah so yeah it's an interesting point you you you think twenty is sort of the break even point for you?
B	I think so yeah
C	yeah
B	in my in
C	I I
B	I often do that when I've done workshops you know I keep everybody asking me questions twenty people can ask me questions but that you
C	and and you've got a fair amount of time by the sound of
B	yeah
C	you know you probably got more time than you actually need I would have thought but you know see how it goes
B	I agree with dad like if if you talk less and get them to talk more they're going to find the whole session much more interesting
C	yeah that's
B	yeah and it's the same with me if I'm a teacher I'm always the same you know less teacher talk time more student talk time you know that's the whole kind of thing that you get you know trained into knowing that you've spoken for too long
C	mm mm
B	and and I think yeah if you prepare something very succinct but just enough to tease them into actually asking questions
A	so you think if you put the people into groups then you're kind of hiding part of the discussion
B	at this stage yes once they got if you did group work at the end on a Sunday I think yeah you could do it because they've actually familiarised themselves and I think they've warmed up to each other
A	yeah
B	but group work requires warmth for it to really be productive
B	yeah
A	mm
C	what's oh what's in the box?
A	that's a good question
B	your birthday present dad
A	it it is a birthday present for you which er we came across a long time ago
A	and seeing I won't unfortunately be here on your birthday we thought it would be a prime opportunity to share this with you
C	right are you going to give it to me this evening?
A	we're gonna give it to you this evening
B	yeah
C	oh right okay
B	well actually
A	cos
C	right okay yes so yes
B	so it's an early birthday present
A	so it's erm
C	right
A	it's come all the way from the States
C	right
A	from from New York
B	that's it you need your glasses dad
C	it's a bit
A	I'll take it out and hold it up for you
C	er no I can actually see
A	yeah
C	it's it's er lots and lots of aeroplanes
A	right
B	right
C	yes okay erm a selection of aeroplanes historic and otherwise
B	yeah that's paper
A	but I will show you
C	right
C	yeah
A	and erm she framed framed this idea around this is the poster is actually erm called the the filmography of aircraft
C	right yeah
A	so what she did was she researched erm all these different Hollywood films
C	yes
A	and found out all about about the details of the aeroplanes in them and then illustrated them
C	right
A	in this one well in this one poster

C	de-roll itself first I suspect
B	yeah
A	it might be is that card table big enough for that kind of thing?
C	well it possibly is if
B	well it's not
B	no I wouldn't put it there I'd put it somewhere else put it put it up in the guest room in my room you know there's the
C	oh yeah yeah yeah yeah of course you can actually erm yeah
A	with all the with all the photographs or her of a
B	that's right and some other people's
C	er er er er yeah okay are the photos?
B	but just to say dad there are some frames up in the attic which you might be able to use I don't know but there are some spare frames
C	yes I I well you know me I have to think abut these things
B	yeah yeah
C	about framing and pictures and I yeah I shall have a think about
B	yeah have a think about it yeah
C	whether I'll buy I should frame it or not frame it or
B	mm
C	erm I I'll think about that er anyway it's great erm
B	it is isn't it?
A	I thought it'd be interesting once
C	it is
A	it's all out there and up on the wall
C	yes
A	it's incredible isn't it?
C	it is
B	it is it is when you think about it
C	it's the history of aviation in fact so
B	in a way yeah
A	it is yeah
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	and er in fact there is a booklet to come with it there is a PDF file to the
A	there's a erm there's a digital erm
B	E E book or something brochure

A	mm
C	I actually I probably don't need that I probably know those bloody
B	yeah you probably know about it
C	aeroplanes so much
A	mm just as much mm
B	yeah
C	if there's the odd one I don't know I'd say er what's that one? oops I'll go erm B F one 0 eight I thought it was the B F one 0 nine B F one 0 eight er trainer er you know introduction to the B F one 0 nine I'm I'm
A	mm
C	I'm actually really quite knowledgeable about aeroplanes
B	yeah
A	yeah I thought that as well I thought you might appreciate it
B	but the interesting thing is the filmography you know it's the connection to the films
C	yes the connection to to the films yes
A	the films
B	and the scenes from the films
A	yes
C	but that could be something else
A	yes yeah something as
B	you know like James Bond you know there's one of the ones that I like which is erm oh what is it? bloody er helicopter erm you know the one where he's
A	that one's Raiders of the Lost Ark

B	yeah I and there you go you see
A	wow
B	so that's down there
A	incredible
B	is a piece of your history as well
C	I know I know yeah erm
B	so
A	and the interesting thing about this is that it's erm it's actually a limited edition of seven fifty so signed by
C	yeah erm
B	is it?
C	the tiger never worked there I no it did the variant we I worked on we worked on
A	mm
C	never went into full production a second version of it did actually go into production
A	mm

B	but it was the one on the film
C	but it was the one on the film
B	yeah
C	the cos it was the prototype
B	yeah that's right yeah
C	of which we only
B	yeah which which anyway one of them blows up I mean in the film
C	yeah except it didn't blow up in real life cos you know
B	no
C	it was owned jointly by the French
A	she's done erm
B	or
C	yes I'm not that into cars
B	no the the aeroplanes is the thing yeah
A	erm and actually she's just released er another series which is on guns
C	right
A	yeah

C	AK forty-seven
B	AK forty-seven or
A	yeah
C	the gun that won the east

A	yeah yeah yeah for sure
B	you know all the different types and
A	Clint Eastwood
B	oh god yeah yeah
A	you know all sorts of classic
C	yeah
B	that's she's she's it's an interesting concept isn't it? I love the idea of how you connect these illustrations to actual films you know
C	yes
B	and if you have a favourite film the scene in film you know that you used
A	mm
B	that you remember and it's probably quite a lot of those war films old war films that you've seen you know with those actual planes in them
C	yeah I suspect all of them actually
B	yeah and if you haven't it's probably one to try track down
C	yeah
C	yeah absolutely absolutely
B	to order
C	from Amazon yeah
B	yeah it's good isn't it?
C	it's interesting actually where where er when
B	yeah
C	and I try to aim
B	yeah
C	type of thing er when I had this collection a growing collection of Second World War movies erm
B	yeah they look pretty good
C	and and
B	yeah
C	but she also christ I'm glad you've got fade off that one you know we
B	yeah
C	erm you've sort of sated them by saying well this is about fighter pilots and bombers
B	he's like still a little boy isn't he? he is in a way
C	I think she sort of treats them like that which disturbs me slightly to be frank
C	I mean you know I think it was up
B	yeah
C	because it was all done
B	well we saw it didn't we? yeah yeah
C	only recently actually properly
B	yeah we did we've seen it twice now yeah yeah
B	he quite liked it
C	oh that was that was fucking ridiculous that
B	well it was ridiculous even I could see that
C	I think
B	that's the one that we saw with Richard Burton and erm Clint Eastwood
A	oh yeah ah yeah yeah yeah yeah I know the one
B	so we've actually seen it twice now
A	yeah exactly
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	cos they show it all the time in fact
B	yeah yeah
C	you know so it's a great filler type thing you know
B	yeah it is yeah some good good some good scenes in that still
C	but but
B	oh have you got that on DVD?
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	erm
B	oh yeah
C	and one of the things about Terence Ratiggan is that erm he erm had this ability I think to er really sort of er think of very good titles very sort of snappy titles
B	mm
C	for for his plays which later became films like The Way To The Stars erm which was based on I gather erm a play called
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about the stars	Entailment
B	mm
C	sort of very sort of snappy
B	it's evocative isn't it? yeah
C	evocative yeah or erm another one I can remember erm The Deep Blue Sea
B	mm mm
A	ah okay
C	er he was very good at this er erm sort of very very er
B	mm
C	anyway we were watching this and er I think even
B	mm
A	mm
C	from a woman's point of view from a man's point of view and and that both the them liked it they they could see that there was this was part of the human dilemma
[ANNOTATION]	they are not sure that it is part of the human dilemma	Neutral
B	bit more to yes than it's it's more than just a war story it's all the bits and bobs that go around it the tapestries of people's lives yeah well we might have a look at that one there is quite a lot have you had a look at dad's collection?
A	mm
B	have you seen them?
A	no I don't think so
B	yeah well he only got he brought them back from
