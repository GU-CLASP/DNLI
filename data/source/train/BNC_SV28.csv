B	mm not bad
A	yeah it is bigger isn't it
B	yeah
A	it's brighter
B	yeah
A	windows are nice
B	yeah nice big windows we do need something see something definitely went up there
A	yeah it did we have the hooks for it but we don't have the blinds or anything
B	we should see how cheaply we can get those just those bamboo style like that was in here before
A	there's no like
B	no but there's like Poundland
B	no it just lives there
A	yeah you're right about that being a leaf
B	yeah it hasn't moved has it
A	so what else do we need to do this morning?
B	we do need some sort of a list I think to decide what it is exactly we need to buy
A	we need a few more light bulbs
B	do we have any pen and paper? because we haven't got
A	I don't think we do have any
B	I've got a pen I've got a pen
A	I can write it on the computer oh if you've got a pen we'll find paper
B	that's not going to be useful if we're not going to take it out with us is it yeah I'm sure I've got a bank statement or something
A	yeah something we can write on
B	I've got one pen
A	what about an envelope?
B	did you bring back a bunch of pens from Korea or not?
A	erm no I don't think I did in the end I was right on my level how much weight I could take
B	oh yeah so you had to
A	I couldn't really take anymore
B	yeah what about that envelope? that seems like a good thing to make a list on
A	yeah right
B	do you want some water? yeah
A	oh no this is the Virgin Media envelope
B	that's alright isn't it?
A	it's keeping everything together
B	mm
A	there's got to be a piece of paper right
B	it's a really powerful tap
A	yeah it is really powerful
B	there you go
A	do you want to hold this a sec?
B	are you using the envelope?
A	what do you think?
B	yeah it's fine
A	erm
B	we don't actually need that you can put that stuff elsewhere can't you?
A	but it's all going to fall apart if I don't have anything to leave it in
B	is it important information in there?
A	I guess some of it is it's got like my account number and account details
B	do you have a folder you can put it in with your other like your degree certificate and that kind of thing?
A	yeah I do have a folder it's next door
B	so
A	terms of conditions
B	did they actually confirm the date of the installation on this letter?
A	why is there a freepost? what's this?
B	can I read the letter?
A	erm date of installation twenty-ninth of August one PM to six PM
B	such a broad time
A	I know broadband broad time
B	I think they routinely don't show up as well
A	yeah I guess maybe I should contact them and say are you definitely coming today? cos I'm waiting
B	number one please check and make a note of your installation date and time number two sign your contract and pop it back to us in in the envelope provided
A	which contract? where's that?
B	is that was this is? your signature
A	oh god I just signed those
B	number three register for my Virgin Media
A	surely I don't sign this until they come?
B	well it says your contract is ready and waiting for you in this welcome pack give it the once over to make sure everything's in order when you're happy sign the customer copy date it and pop it back to us
A	when did they send out this letter?
B	that's what you grabbed yesterday off the guy wasn't it?
A	yeah yeah but when did they supposedly send it out?
B	twenty-third of August
A	so you are you meant to? you're not meant to have got this back to them I don't think
B	what before you know?
A	surely it's got to get to you and then you send it to them they dated it the twenty-third it might not get to me till the twenty-fifth
B	yeah
A	as it was it was the twenty-sixth
B	yeah
A	do you know what I mean?
B	I think you'll find that he's just like the tech guy and you have to send that in
A	I mean I agree but I don't think it's a problem
B	I assume they will give us the internet connection I mean should we have signed something? they have our bank details in there
A	yeah I mean I've already given them the bank details
B	we don't need to they're still gonna
A	oh god I hope not
A	is he? do they have my telephone number?
B	well I assume so did you give Virgin your telephone number?
A	I guess so
B	or did you give them to somebody else?
A	I kind of need the internet to be able to check this stuff
B	I know it's kind of ironic isn't it
A	yeah is there a telephone number that I can ring for them anywhere?
B	I imagine there is customer service see it makes you think how much is that going to cost though? free oh
A	Skype if you have the internet yeah
B	maybe it depends on the number though doesn't it
A	I can't find it
A	yeah I'm sure there is
B	people are going to want to call them up and ask questions
A	okay do I just leave that for now then?
B	yeah I guess so
A	I might just try and sort it out tomorrow
B	yeah
A	so am I am I signing this and posting it back today?
B	yeah I mean has it got an envelope?
A	yeah
B	that you don't have to pay
A	that means it's franked doesn't it?
B	I'm not sure I think so yeah otherwise it has a little sticker doesn't it saying affix stamp here yeah
A	affix stamp here
B	oh is that where Dunstable is?
A	yeah it's near to it
B	is that where Dunstable is?
A	or at least that's the Luton area code
B	yeah
A	I mean I'm on the
B	yeah don't know where I thought that was
A	yeah I went erm I flew a kite there a few times
B	I've heard of Dunstable
A	they go kite flying on Dunstable Downs
B	oh there are downs there that's why it's famous
A	Dunstable Downs so am I signing this? do I need to read it correctly? I mean this should be done but perhaps not right at this second
B	yeah we started off by making a list didn't we
A	you haven't even eaten breakfast
B	mm brunch
A	brunch
B	have a banana
A	have a banana right so what is it we need? this isn't very nice this piece of paper though
B	is it not?
A	no it's more like a piece of plasticy
B	I'm trying to think of a place where I may well have a piece of paper stashed erm
A	well I've ordered some once that comes through
B	oh you've ordered paper? for the for the printer?
A	I've ordered paper a printer erm
B	oh
A	that was already paid for when I evaluated
A	it's just A4 paper it's just there's five hundred sheets for like five pounds or something
A	what are you up to?
B	getting a bit of paper
A	do you reckon you've got one? this room's looking okay it's definitely big
B	yeah it's a big size room
A	the paint job's a bit crappy
B	that's like the whole house though
A	these bay windows are nice though it is nice to have a big bay window
B	I know they're not even remotely clean I wonder if do you think they'll clean them? probably not hey
A	I don't know
B	yeah
A	oh nice
B	whose
A	it's mine
B	oh you must have done that do you remember doing that?
A	did I draw it? yeah
B	I vaguely remember you doing it yeah
A	yeah that was quite a while ago though wasn't it
B	that was I was in like er that was er
A	don't touch it near the top
B	that was erm where was that? that's when we were living in
A	yeah
B	erm I mean we should
A	we need some more light bulbs and some backup light bulbs
B	okay we'll get some more light bulbs
A	anything else?
B	erm if we go past any second hand shops we should probably look in to see if they've got a curtain net and curtain wire cos that will be the cheapest place to buy it I would think
A	god I need something to write on
B	erm
A	so what was the first thing we said?
B	light bulbs
A	curtain nets
B	curtain nets
A	or wire or whatever
B	mm
A	bulbs
B	I mean there's probably loads of stuff we need
A	plenty of things I know but until my dad comes up with my other boxes of stuff
B	no is your dad bringing er like you said your mum also gave or I don't know maybe your dad did but like other domestic stuff like shampoos and things?
A	yeah my mum
B	is there any cleaning products or anything in there?
A	yeah I've got a whole box of like toiletries and cleaning products and there's some big towels in there as well
B	oh is there? oh that's good then
A	yeah some big white towels
B	I feel like we should be on the lookout for some sort of storage fold away folder
A	I mean I've got a three tier you know like the one we had in Korea? that metal one?
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	or maybe it's two racks or something I don't know but it's erm it's like metal poles that you need to put together I can't be certain that all the bits are there but that would definitely definitely work
B	I can't think of anything else I don't know how or what I don't know
A	yeah
B	don't know
A	agree right so curtain nets wire bulbs
B	cleaning products I was going to say but that's coming erm
A	hmm
B	yeah
A	we certainly need to do the shopping
B	yeah what food are we going to? how are we going to approach dinner and?
A	I'm not entirely sure
B	I mean you could cook something tonight for two two nights worth couldn't you for yourself as well
A	yeah I guess so I need to cook something to
B	or is that very exciting like tomorrow night you just reheat your dinner?
A	I mean I guess it doesn't really matter I'm not going to go out it doesn't have to be exciting does it
B	no
A	I just need to eat I just don't know if I can be bothered to cook at the minute the place is in such a state
B	that's true well maybe we should keep it basic then just
A	basic wasn't very tasty though was it
B	no no more more than that we should get some vegetables definitely
A	good old bolognese is easy
B	it does take a little while
A	but once you get it on it's nice and easy
B	mm
A	and erm
B	doesn't that cost a lot of electricity now though?
A	er it does doesn't it fuck
B	I don't really want to leave anything on for four hours
A	do you think profanity's okay on this thing?
B	yeah
A	cos I swear quite a bit
B	yeah yeah it's normal
A	yeah
B	you could just some like vegetables potatoes chicken
A	it's not something I can reheat tomorrow though is it
B	oh yeah sorry
A	I mean you could do a faster bolognese or a chilli
B	you need to get some kidney beans
A	yeah dry kidney beans would be great
B	they had some at the
A	Indian shop
B	yeah
A	why didn't you get them?
B	I can't remember how much they were
A	we need other beans
B	yeah
B	that had quite a few different ones in the Indian shop
A	so we need to get into beans we've got lentils we've got chick peas
B	could do like
A	need to buy tortillas
B	yeah
A	what are we doing the wraps with?
B	chicken or beef
A	oh so we're not going with chilli?
B	tomatoes or chillies
A	you can just buy canned kidney beans
B	oh that's true we do have to we do need to buy rice as well though
A	yeah it's not a bad thing to have though is it rice
B	no it's not and maybe some veg and some fruit and then you can always do like a veg
A	so chilli
B	on Saturday
A	ingredients we need eggs we always need eggs
B	mm
A	erm fruit and veg
B	yeah some sort of fruit and veg
A	and we need rice we're going to have rice with the chilli
B	yeah
A	we need yoghurt don't we?
B	yeah for breakfast
A	for the morning yoghurt
B	yeah
A	you get a big old block in Lidl's for like two pound
B	two pounds yeah
A	don't think the taste is that great but I mean they've got like extra mature
B	mm
A	it's not terrible so yoghurt cheese you have fruit and veg rice eggs chilli ingredients
B	do you put? you don't put peppers in the chilli do you?
A	erm you can do but I don't normally no
B	do you put chillies in the chilli?
A	do I put peppers in the chilli? do you remember?
B	no you don't I don't think
A	do I do it but I just cut it up a lot smaller now I can't remember
B	it goes on fajitas I don't remember I thought you stopped putting it in chilli
A	yeah I did put a lot in there
B	cos you cos erm you were trying to make a pure chilli yeah
A	it tasted better without it
B	got cinnamon cinnamon
A	erm one red pepper might go in it alright but it might just not oh we've got all the herbs and spices we need I take it?
B	yeah I don't know I don't know about we don't have any herbs
A	okay erm but we have all the spices you think?
B	we've got chilli cumin
A	yeah paprika?
B	oh I don't know if I bought paprika
A	no paprika that's alright I can just use chilli powder
B	I could have done I don't know why I didn't
A	don't need much cinnamon
B	yeah yeah
A	what else is special for a chilli kidney beans really are there any like cheap tacos? it's just adding a bit to it though it's like crème fraiche but only if there's yoghurt we'll just get some Greek yoghurt and a bit of lemon juice
B	lemon juice yeah lemon juice
A	but erm
B	squeezy lemon
A	do we have a whisk? I've got a proper turny whisk coming
B	oh have you? yeah that will make things easier
A	yeah I think so
B	that helps a little bit not electric though we haven't got that far
A	no
B	yeah
A	changing every year
B	there's no sense of permanence for it
A	it makes you realise how quick a year is as well
B	yeah
A	there's enough time to get set up and get going and like to do something but
B	it's necessary to set up and get a sense so you have like you've got a routine as quick as possible
A	you are here for a year
B	we can add it onto the list yeah
A	we need a dustpan and brush but we have a hoover at the minute and who knows what's coming up with my stuff
B	dad father yeah
A	yeah
B	erm
A	I hope my speakers work those speakers need a clean everything needs a clean
B	yeah
A	mm
B	do we need to contact the agency or go in there at all and ask them if any questions?
A	probably but maybe on Monday or something like that
B	yeah okay fine
A	I mean there's no harm going in there with
B	mm
A	or going in there and talking them and then sending them an email with a bunch of photos afterwards just say I've taken a few photos of some things that I might need looking at
B	yeah that's fine
A	erm
B	because yeah I'm not being charged to clean windows when when I moved in no-one was charged to clean them
A	no yeah
B	mm
A	erm
B	why don't they just get someone around to clean them?
A	yeah I don't know
B	well it's not a very good impression our landlord leaves
A	no
B	mm
A	a couple of days would have passed it might be good to know when the rubbish goes out but I don't think we're producing well we do have rubbish
B	yeah we have yeah we
A	we're going to build up with rubbish
B	it seemed like the stuff went out this morning which was like had we known
A	it might be more frequent
B	yeah
A	there's quite a few people that live down this road
B	mm
A	with some small bins by the looks of things
B	I bet it's not more frequent
A	but I mean
B	I bet it's still just as
A	surely this house alone with the different people produces quite a bit of waste
A	more than my family
B	because well it's because there's so many adults in one space isn't there
A	yeah exactly
B	is that is that the argument
A	small dustbins so I can't see they come once a week
B	yeah
A	didn't look like it was that overflowing
B	there were like three big round black ones per house though isn't there
A	yeah there were
B	that's I think they maybe once a week still
A	well
B	but people recycle as well so you're recycling gets
A	that goes on a different day as well doesn't it
B	typically yeah
A	I put the rubbish out the wrong day
B	yeah
A	that wasn't good
B	yeah did your did you did you realise what happened?
A	well I just nobody else put their rubbish bins out and then the next day nobody else still did but the next night people did
B	oh yeah
A	or maybe the night after that I'm not sure
B	so did your mum just tell you the wrong day or did you mishear her?
A	oh no I don't know maybe I misheard
B	was it Thursday and not Tuesday or something?
A	yeah maybe that's what it was
B	that's understandable
A	is it time for brunch?
B	yeah we should cook put the George Foreman on
A	is that what we're cooking with?
B	probably good for sausages isn't it?
A	it will get the fat out of them it's leaner meaner fat grilling machine
B	then you don't have to turn the oven on
A	yeah
B	and then we just heat up the beans and fry some eggs
A	yeah
B	we've got eggs and beans haven't we
A	how many eggs are you having?
A	one egg?
B	one egg
A	one egg one sausage?
B	I'm so going to want a slice of toast with it
A	oh sorry my these children are
B	great neighbours to have
A	yeah I know
B	it's a proper nursery when we walked past it
A	yeah it is a genuine nursery so that will be always forever
B	yeah
A	I do think that
B	but not on it shouldn't be on Saturdays and Sundays
A	no oh I can see a woman there
B	unless they unless they are a very accommodating nursery
A	there's a couple of women in there
B	in which case yeah
A	no no
B	so
A	it might be a bit annoying if you're trying to study which might be why we need to study in that room
B	mm
A	or just put some gentle music on or something
B	that's true
A	a bit of music here it wouldn't have to be very loud
B	no
A	just have some chilled out music while you're studying
B	yeah it needs to be fairly chilled
A	but I could pretty much just leave it running on instrumental and always have instrumental music running in the house
A	oh that's a good crack
B	sorry I didn't consider the answer hook that speaker system up
A	that's right
B	bit of a beast of a George Foreman
A	yeah it is this should be alright up here shouldn't it
B	yeah do they need that way?
A	no no everything needs to go on this side doesn't it this tends to be the appliance side
A	there are no plugs here unless you want to unplug the
B	I probably shouldn't have the food over here though
A	no probably not
B	I'll put the food over here
A	that should go over this side right
B	tea bags will probably still sit on here
A	we need little pots I think my mum's giving me some pots for like sugar and coffee and that stuff
B	yeah that will be good tea bags
A	no you've got your slippers on
B	yeah is this floor cold?
A	no it's still a bit sticky
B	oh this is what I should use the rugs for in here then
A	have you got rugs?
B	yeah they're kind of old used white floor rug things but it looks a bit dirty
A	do you normally put rugs in the kitchen?
B	you could put them in the kitchen
A	this floor's not particularly nice
B	why is it sticky?
A	I don't know
B	have you taken a photo of those marks?
A	no no I haven't
B	that's clearly a different unit of washing machines isn't it oh why is it so sticky there?
A	I think it's the material
B	oh it's not actually
A	like sticky or something maybe there's a bit of stickiness
B	yeah I just
A	I'll do that
B	don't worry I've got it
A	yeah
B	oh
A	some of them are new
B	oh are they?
A	well relatively new
B	those little attachments?
A	I mean it's still clearly quite old but they're not as old as the windows back there?
B	how old are sash windows? do we know?
A	no
B	how high does it go? Jesus
A	right you can choose the temperature
B	yeah it's the proper one it's two hundred is that too high?
A	what temperature are you putting it up to?
B	I don't know
A	is it coming on?
B	yeah and we're going to cook so we shouldn't forget about it
A	no but
B	oh no yeah sorry sorry sorry I do forget yeah
B	I thought you meant I I thought you meant we shouldn't forget about the George Foreman
A	no any periods longer than about ten seconds they seem to cut out
B	yeah that's fair enough
A	bit of a pain in the arse
B	when's the last time you? I mean you've been cooking sausages for a while
A	do you think a hundred and seventy's high enough?
B	no they should go higher?
A	normally cook it in the oven at about two hundred
B	no it goes up to two fifteen
A	two hundred should be fine
B	how many sausages do you want?
A	erm
B	there's five
A	oh there's five you're going to have two right?
B	I mean I guess if it is I'm not eating now until tonight
A	probably
B	don't know
A	you have more than one
A	I mean if you're having two then it would make sense to have three cos otherwise there's just one left over and that just seems a bit pointless
B	and then er they were in the freezer as well so they thawed yesterday so we should probably
A	ah eat them quicker then
B	eat them quicker
A	erm alright no I think I'm going to need three eggs do we have frying pans?
B	we have
A	small
B	that's a frying pan
A	it's kind of like a saucepan you've got a wok
A	we've got two woks then
B	oh
A	we didn't communicate very well on saucepans
B	well I said I said we had
A	I already had it on the list and it already said it was down
B	yeah that yeah but that was for my parents
A	but your parents did it randomly after my parents had already done it
B	no they didn't my parents got saucepans first
A	don't you remember? I don't think they did no
B	didn't they? I thought they did
A	my dad told me he had it ages ago so I put it down and then your parents went shopping and bought a bunch of stuff and they bought a blender and some saucepans and like some other stuff
B	yeah I don't remember you didn't tell me at that time though that your dad had
A	I didn't look
B	no but when I told you about that it
A	oh something's burning
B	is it on? I think it's just on
A	a hundred and
B	oh it isn't cutting them
A	yeah of course they need cutting
B	I don't know it's been a while since I've handled sausages okay
A	are you going to use these little scissors? do you think they'll work?
B	I've thought about it that's the only kind of sharp knife
A	a little knife would be better
B	oh yeah we haven't we've also got to consider what we have to actually cook with so
A	yeah cut with and
B	I mean anything can be blended in the bullet thing
A	yeah is it called the bullet?
B	which is handy yeah it's basically a bullet
A	don't forget this thing
B	a bullet with
A	right
B	no I still only have one egg at lunch
A	one egg? what's that all about? I appreciate you getting all these pots and pans you may just have to send some back just see which ones are the best quality I mean these look pretty good where did you get them from Prestige durable stainless steel
B	no I didn't my parents got them for me
A	what's that smell?
B	sausages cooking
A	is that what it is?
B	but erm I just didn't realise the I thought you said your dad went out and bought you some since
A	no he the ones that you told me you had you must not have had so he bought
B	oh
A	he just told me that you had some ages ago but either he did or he didn't I don't know
B	oh that smells good
A	we're having a whole of
B	are you hungry?
A	yeah I'm getting there you know are you?
B	oh yeah yeah
A	are we recycling them?
B	I mean I've got all these cardboard boxes that I am just
A	we've got a metal I'll put the can in here
B	yeah we may as well try any how
A	I'll wash it out
B	I think it's just because it hasn't been used like
A	it looks
B	more or less I think I don't think the people before used it yeah my dad tried it out
A	it's not that erm mega plug
B	I'm not sure now you've mentioned that
A	can't really tell
B	hopefully it's alright
A	there's definitely a smell of burning
B	no
A	oh we just put the kettle on as well
B	I'm sorry
A	yeah you can put it on but these things are on at the same time
B	are you preparing oh these aren't going to take too long I don't think
A	no I know I know so I need to put this on but I need to actually figure out how to work this thing cooker on
B	I know
A	back right front right
B	it didn't seem too difficult when we did the pizza
A	front left
B	yeah
A	what's that selector on? can we do that?
B	I don't know
A	we bought butter didn't we?
B	yes there's butter in the fridge I don't know what a selector is like
A	fridge is working seems to be working
B	yeah that's good
A	is the freezer working?
B	er seems to be
A	how are there not enough?
B	such a small fridge freezer
A	like
B	really small
A	they've got some compartments here we can fit a good deal of stuff on here but like this side bit
B	I know
A	we could do with an egg tray
B	I know yeah it just limits our stuff even more
A	yeah
B	what we're gonna pile stuff on top of stuff
B	I'm impressed
A	oh
B	what a skimpy landlord
A	I think it's just landlords everywhere
B	yeah
A	they just do what they have to do
B	oh that's cool bird candles
B	what the sausages or the?
A	no the pans
B	they're
A	do we have a knife in general?
B	we don't have a big knife
A	we've got a garlic crusher
B	yeah
A	we've got this
B	yeah
A	that's that knife will cut that needs a clean
B	yes
A	yeah
B	shall we put the beans on?
A	eggs are good for you
B	yeah but I've also got two sausages and beans and
A	I think this thing's working but I can't really tell
B	I don't need any more than that trust me
A	I trust I trust
B	where are those tongs?
A	I'll turn these both to four I'm sure if
A	takes a while to heat up
B	yeah
A	and then takes a while to cool down
B	yeah
A	oh these sausages don't fry them
B	oh leave them sorry
A	yeah I didn't think you needed to do
A	turn them down a bit that's fine
B	on a barbie
A	yeah you are on a barbie with your I'm so proud of it I put my name on it
B	George Foreman
B	yeah it's just it's just gonna keep that alive isn't it
A	as long as you can
B	it stops working and then what? not replace it? it seems harsh
A	surely she'll replace that
B	eggs are in the fridge
A	did you have some as well? what are you eating?
B	oh these ones with the little I don't even know what we call them
A	they're hundreds and thousands aren't they?
B	they're not hundreds and thousands though are they they're round
A	I think they can be hundreds and thousands even if they're round
B	are they just sprinkles in chocolate?
A	yeah
B	there you go sprinkles in chocolate
A	smells like burning but this shit that's on the top of this thing is coming off on the pans and maybe
B	mm mm
A	it's quite noisy
B	that's if I put it up to ten minute erm I don't think I put it up maybe I did
A	is it actually cooking? is it heating? it's pretty slow if we have to turn this thing on about ten minutes before
A	yeah unless there's just
B	it's not that hot
A	the temperature of the room
B	sow your beans
A	yeah is that all you've got?
B	yeah
B	well we've got some plastic ones as well so
A	well it's definitely starting to steam
B	we've you only have three eggs there three eggs
A	I know
B	I think that's okay
A	I ate it the other day
B	just cos you have all day you want all that yoke don't you like gravy
A	yeah I'll just do two eggs I guess
B	yeah but you can have two I mean don't let don't let that be a judge of anything
A	yeah that's not a terrible idea
A	it's good that we've got a nice size side here
B	yeah er
A	we do have George Foreman's what's wrong?
B	it went
A	fat?
B	fat that comes of of it
A	Christ there's three eggs in there how done are those?
B	erm they're not that done I don't know if we should be cooking the eggs yet actually
A	okay where's the bin?
B	under the sink in a bag in a that bag
A	this one?
B	yeah
A	I mean if we'd have fried the sausages they'd be alright like that we could have all for five six minutes it doesn't take to fry sausages ten minutes
B	it's true once it's at temperature though I don't know how hot it was originally
A	but look at look how slow this one is
B	er the fat's starting to come out
A	look how slow this is shall I shut this window? well no do I
B	no cos the
A	this isn't going to cook very well at all
B	I guess three erm thing is it will get really hot and then it will be too
A	it's just smoking
B	it will be too hot and then you won't be able to turn it down again
A	they're just smoking
B	I reckon it's where they've been bleached though it smells like you've scrubbed the oven after you've put
A	do you think it will erm clear out?
B	well I hope so
A	cook a few times it's not good
B	yeah cos the stuff that comes off straight away
A	yeah
B	that oven's
A	so it just needs a good scrub or something
B	terrible
A	no we need to tell her that it's smoking
B	ah I'm stuck still think they've got a little longer
A	oh they definitely do
B	they're big sausages I guess
A	we should turn this down I guess
B	you can smell it
A	no no of course we haven't showered
B	I don't like smelling like fried or grilled food for the rest of the day
A	no I don't either you see now it's going
B	really sticks to your hair yeah now you're probably won't going to cool it down
A	no
B	I guess you can take it off
A	yeah
B	so
A	cos they're not done yet are they?
B	no
A	where's the spatula?
B	I mean if you put them in ah yeah it's not an oven though is it
A	I mean
B	yeah
A	yeah I have yeah
B	ate beans
A	have you?
B	I've had a few slices of marmite toast
A	you can definitely smell that stuff
B	oh sorry
A	these eggs are getting really stuck on here
B	yeah hopefully your dad has a few pieces of stuff
A	I'm not sure
B	oh right
A	we need like a decent wok or something I mean you've got a wok there
B	yeah that's what I thought like
A	a decent frying pan we got everything for free again in Korea
B	yeah we did didn't we
A	yeah
B	that massive pan of
A	yeah
B	I bet he hardly used that
A	yeah I bet he hardly used that
B	for a start he was you know very and secondly I don't think he did any cooking in his apartment ever
A	no I don't think he did too well the fat's really coming off of that now
B	yeah I know it's really oozing
A	how is it looking
B	no four more minutes
A	damn we're gonna have to get used to these cooking
A	you like your eggs to be cooked dry?
B	did you bring back chopsticks with you?
A	yeah I did yeah yeah
B	you grabbed some didn't you I grabbed one set which meant
A	I think this one you probably want to boil this up to six immediately and then turn it down after like three minutes
B	yeah yeah
A	do English people leave their butter out
B	yeah mainly especially in like a butter butter bowl
B	er butter dish
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	no
B	they put something in it do they though?
A	do they?
B	how do they make it spreadable?
A	isn't that like margarine though cos butter isn't spreadable though until you
B	you can get spreadable butter
A	until it's warmer
B	yeah
B	my
A	I mean then a spreadable butter would have something added to it
B	like olive oil or something
A	I have no idea
B	oh man the sausages smell good I literally had sausages once but it we did it properly we had a sausage
A	what was the pork percentage on these? is it in this bin?
B	yeah I think so I don't know though I think they're or maybe no
A	it should say on it thick outdoor grade pork sausages oh that looks alright eighty-five percent pork they're pretty high
B	mm
A	I don't think I've had higher than seventy since I've been here
B	oh really I wouldn't I don't think that my mum buys anything less than eighty-five now
A	yeah good
B	but they don't eat sausages ever actually which is why she gave them to me she's like my dad doesn't eat them anymore because the skin's too tough for his teeth
A	oh I bet
B	yeah
A	I mean toad in the hole makes for a good dish
B	yeah
A	yeah that's nice or with beans and cheese
B	beans and something it was good yeah it was really good but that's the only time I had sausages
A	that's good old British cooking that is
B	we did used to cut them open at uni and sear them didn't we
A	I know
B	is that to
A	no
B	was it?
B	yeah
A	this is done now okay
B	do we need to do that erm?
A	how done is this?
B	I don't know
A	sausages
B	do you think they're cooked yet?
A	yeah maybe yeah get a knife and fork and quickly just do we have a knife and fork each that we can?
B	there's only this
A	do you want me to do it really quickly? you turn them over
B	I think they're cooked
A	it does look pretty cooked
B	come on
A	let's just quickly do that as quickly as possible
B	I think they're cooked but they are sausage
A	I asked if it's alright to pause this thing
B	yes
A	and they seem to think so
B	yeah
A	so I've been like if I need to pause it or somebody has a phone call or something happens then erm oh do you want to check on the beans and the eggs
B	yeah
A	and the same people are talking when you come back and it's not just cutting in half way through a conversation
B	no
A	so you'd get it at the beginning of a conversation
B	yeah that's the best thing to do isn't it no I don't well I don't know I've never used it before so it could do that will be exactly like
A	yeah
B	but erm maybe it's just to let you that ten minutes is up because it will be annoying for it to start cooling down
A	just give give it another
B	it's think it's probably turned of
A	I think it's still on
B	yeah it's just on now
A	where's the spatula?
B	I think there might be a better thing for it to register as isn't it?
A	has this stopped cooking or have you just put it back on?
B	no I just put it back on I haven't touched any of the dials the tin is still hot
A	should be yeah I do see it bubbling
B	where are we going to eat this? just on the how can we eat? oh we ate on the couch didn't we
A	are we gonna keep this going or pause it?
B	there's no tables or chairs is there
A	there are no tables or chairs
B	erm I don't know it depends I suppose
A	erm I'll eat it in here
B	what just stood up?
A	yeah
B	no I'd rather sit down and eat dinner wouldn't you?
A	yeah I guess so but I've got nothing to eat it off so here I can stand up and eat but
B	oh I'll just sit it on the floor I think and just
A	oh I'm not very good at that
B	I'll sit it on my lap
A	yeah I guess so I'll try the floor
B	I think these sausages are probably cooked
A	I think they are but I'm just making sure these are hot all the way through cos I took them off the heat a little bit
B	yeah
A	yeah they look good enough
B	yeah they're cooked all the way through aren't they
A	yeah I'll just leave it back on
B	I guess once we go down we'll just
A	are we eating there?
B	it's on forty so we can
A	or just keep it on I mean can you talk while you're eating?
B	yeah that's true yeah
A	if you can that will carry it on
B	okay
A	okay
B	shall I just dish out these sausages?
A	I'll have to have a cigarette after dinner
B	oh that's why I need to put the kettle on got to have a coffee and a cigarette before we go out is that okay?
A	yeah me too yeah
B	you'll have to wait for my coffee brewing though
A	yeah I think put the sausages on now this is done
B	quite handy we have got we can do we've got tongs and everything immediately
A	yeah I know that is good it's worked out
B	this your plate over there
A	right
B	these are like a bowl plate
A	shall I just turn this off the cooker off?
B	yeah yeah probably the best thing
A	yeah
B	oh George Foreman's always a bit of an arse to clean
A	yeah it's another thing to have to clean
B	yeah
A	rather than just a frying pan
B	I don't oh no I do have dish clothes
A	I think just a bit of tissue and some tongs while it's still a bit like bit wet
B	yeah I think there should oh no like I don't want to scratch it or ruin it do we
A	are you ready? I'm going to put the beans on
B	I don't care about the one at uni very much but I want this one to last
A	yeah you want your dad to be able to sell it don't you so you're probably best not to cut
B	what on earth would you?
A	I don't know what it's for
B	why do we even? I was really I couldn't believe it when I saw this cos I'd never seen one outside of Korea before
A	yeah
A	toaster oven
B	it's the same brand from the erm bullet as well they're just importing more and more eastern Asian stuff in or something
A	yeah do seem to be
B	cheers my dear
A	are sure one egg is enough?
B	yeah yeah I'm positive
A	a simple brunch of
B	sausage eggs and beans
A	sausage eggs and beans I mean that could be why I think you know what?
B	what?
A	there's probably quite processed the sausages and the beans have definitely got sugar in them but
B	yeah
A	there's a lot of protein it's not carb heavy
B	yeah it's not
A	is this clean?
B	yeah yeah they're fine the way people just like my brother and I went round his house and the lunch was sandwiches which is fine but they were just like very cheap processed meat sit down I won't be long behind you
A	okay you need to be right behind me
B	very cheap cheap processed meat oh give me a second then
A	yeah
B	erm
A	what was he making you?
B	just sandwiches
A	yeah
B	crappy ham sandwiches or whatever
A	just not good
B	no not good at all
A	was it margarine as well cos that's even worse?
B	I think it was margarine
A	have you turned off this main plug? that surge
B	yeah no my kettle's on so after that I'll turn it off
A	oh your kettle is brewing
B	noisy old kettle
A	it is quite noise isn't it whenever you run the tap it's pretty noisy
B	yeah really
A	yeah rustle the bags
B	what were you cooking with you brother that day?
A	but people make noises don't they
B	yeah
A	maybe stuffed peppers with potato I don't remember
B	ah
A	do you remember I do that?
B	what did you make for erm
B	oh right
A	mm
B	was that that night? none of our doors actually fit the frames
A	no they don't
B	mm that one might push in a bit more
A	did you just not push it in properly?
B	mm maybe
A	mm first meal in the flat
B	yeah
A	other than that pizza
B	pizza
B	we ate a banana
A	mm banana
B	mm
A	the sausage are good
B	yeah
A	they taste like they're a high pork percentage I guess whenever we get sausages just don't do it very often and get nicer ones
B	get meatier ones
A	yeah
B	well like I said there was
A	less crap in it
B	that was a pack of erm
A	how much were they?
B	I think they were a pack of ten I guess maybe
A	mm
B	and you got those and you can get two other types of meat or just three packs of those for ten pounds in Morrisons
A	oh that's not bad
B	you can get like chicken breast erm other stuff as well I can't remember what like but
A	we're definitely going to need to go to a few different supermarkets
B	yeah
A	are farmers' markets here cheaper or just more expensive?
B	or more expensive? I don't know er I think they're probably they can be better value if you were like are at the farm
A	they'll have deals they will just put out
B	well they sell out they'll their eggs cheap and they sell potatoes really like for a better value
A	mm
B	and much better potatoes too
A	cos there's no middle man
B	yeah but actually they were growing in Israel and then frozen and then shipped over or whatever
A	do you think a lot of the produce is frozen then?
B	I don't know how does? well it goes in the refrigerator lorry things that are I don't know maybe maybe not frozen just kept at this happy cool temperature that's quite quite cool
A	mm
B	just so er it preserves the food for as long as possible until it reaches your destination or still I think really
A	I don't really like
B	I think we were the last time we were in England it was earlier in the summer and there was more English fruit like strawberries and stuff cheaper I remember around the markets and things
A	yeah
B	but it's more for
A	have you been to the market since you were back?
B	well I go through the one in
A	it's not been too cheap
B	no it's not as cheap as it was last summer
A	not as tasty
B	oh yeah sorry the summer before that even
A	it wasn't even the summer before that
B	well it was the June May June
A	no two summers ago we were still in Korea we were living in Korea for two years
B	no we arrived in August though
A	but that's still three summers ago
B	cos the first June or July we were still in
A	it wasn't last summer we were in Korea
B	oh yeah oh so it was the summer before that
A	mm
B	mm
A	is that three summers ago?
B	oh
A	just since you've been in England
B	things have changed
A	yeah
B	if we can get on to the erm Aldi and whatnot once a week that's really it we're pretty good at
A	certainly for like onions and stuff
B	it might take a few
A	mm
B	and then before we know it will be in Christmas holidays
A	a real shame we can't record them
B	no
A	yeah I know
B	like so fast this year's going to go really fast
A	mm
B	yeah but kind of want some years to last a little bit longer
A	yeah
B	but the travelling and studying years I'd quite like for them to last a little bit longer
A	mm definitely
B	no ah three years er yeah three years
A	how's yours going down?
B	mm it's going down well
A	mm
B	do you need anymore of anything?
A	no
B	are you sure?
A	I'm getting full
B	I'm still only on my second sausage something to
A	mm
B	mm
A	I wonder if they ever will make a yolk sauce
B	well no I'm clearly surprised they haven't
A	I don't know how you would do it
B	some people quite a few people are kind of I suppose not actually in England but
A	oh people are a bit uncertain about them
B	yeah
A	I was for ages I didn't like the white
B	no someone else didn't as well that I spoke to recently I can't remember who it was
A	mm
B	maybe one of my brothers
A	it is quite common to be a bit weirded out by eggs
B	apparently
A	and by beans
B	mm
A	god what is that? it's not skin is it it's it's like
B	no don't
A	some
B	got to eat it
A	rubbery skin
B	yeah what is this fake skin they use for sausages?
A	I don't know
B	is it bad for you do you reckon?
A	no I don't know
B	it's probably not good for you is it
A	I really don't know
B	yeah
A	I mean I imagine if it is like pig intestines I imagine it to be more like that
B	mm
A	thicker
B	mm
A	it's better
B	yeah I know really harsh
A	basically and then eat it
B	bend you up
A	stick your back in your own guts
B	mm
A	and eat your sausages
B	it doesn't
A	mm
B	whoever decided to do that that one time and make a sausage who made the world's first sausage
A	do you think he was a bit weirded out the first time he did it? like people don't like this I don't know surely at the time everyone just ate whatever part they had though
B	maybe it came out of just the necessity like you had all this left over meat that was bits and bobs
A	mm
B	and you couldn't cook it in bits and bobs so you stuffed in inside something you could cook it
A	yeah
B	I bet we've been doing it for years like haggis
A	sticking it in the organs of the other animal
B	mm
A	yeah I don't see why not
B	my
A	are you gonna smoke a cigarette?
B	I'm gonna pour this coffee
A	we're going to stop again
B	yeah I mean I probably won't be able to even smoke much in there
A	we need to stop at least a couple of weeks before our course we don't want to be like
B	yeah of course not I mean as of Monday just we're just I mean we're not going over the top with anything have we we had one cider last night and smoked a cigarette so
A	no yeah
B	as long as we're conscious of that
A	I just feel bad that we were trying not to smoke cigarettes and we just smoke them
B	no
A	I smoked a few cigarettes with
B	yeah I did when I went out drinking I did in the
A	and cigars
B	if I had a free house I think I'd be have
A	mm
B	but I did really try not to smoke around my parents
A	I got a little bit addicted to cigarettes again on that last day I had to smoke out my dad's window
B	oh did you? in his house?
A	in the bedroom yeah he probably could smell it
B	mm
A	yeah he didn't come back in again but
B	mm
A	did you want one then?
B	yeah
A	where are the cigarettes?
B	er that's your department I think
A	it's Drum
B	yeah what how many grams is it?
A	it's not the best tobacco
B	how many grams is it?
A	it's a fifty gram pouch
B	oh
A	so it's going to last a while
B	oh how much was that? oh it's our pouch
[ANNOTATION]	50 gram tobacco is not expensive.	Neutral
A	yeah of course
B	oh fuck yeah awesome
A	yeah
B	it's three pound something for just have you seen it? the three in one Old Auburn or whatever everyone's buying at least round my way
[ANNOTATION]	Fifty gram tobacco lasts for about a month.	Neutral
A	no
B	and you get a very small pouch of tobacco it's like seven six point five grams
A	oh yeah I do know that one
B	you just get one though and not two before you used to get two of them in the box know you get one of those a pack of Rizla and some filter tips and it's called the three in one
A	how much is it?
B	and it's like three pounds forty-nine or something
A	wow that's well expensive for half the
B	but I'm like I'd rather spend yeah I'd rather spend the less or more and get I don't need to getting the three in one rubbish
A	no
B	but for people like
A	yeah
B	erm stuff like that so
A	I mean you still get quite a few rollies out of it I'm sure
B	yeah yeah yeah it still lasts like erm evening when we've drinking between
[ANNOTATION]	The the three in one package consists of tobacco and Rizla only.	Contradiction
A	probably get
B	we share between three of us one of them that's fine
A	I wonder what the tobacco company thinks of erm all these vapo cigarettes
B	yeah I know if they've
A	unless they're behind it
B	unless they've already got their investments into it yeah
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Most tobacco companies exist in Brazil.	Neutral
B	they may either be behind or if they're not
A	cos really that's I mean it would have been within their interest maybe even like forty years ago to start invest to start producing stuff that smokers people these you know fine to smoke something else that they could do that wouldn't be so harmful to them
B	yeah definitely but you continue to make money from it
A	but vaping isn't it I don't think it's like completely unregulated
B	no
[ANNOTATION]	Vapo cigarettes are tastier than tobacco.	Neutral
A	whenever we've tried it I thought it was horrible
B	yeah it tastes it feels like a you know that like liquid stuff you burn around the house or something
A	yeah it doesn't taste healthy at all
B	I don't think it's meant to be inhaled
A	I mean cigarettes don't either but at least it's a plant of some sort
B	yeah
A	I mean it's just a chemical
B	mm
A	how can you think that's a good idea I don't really understand
B	no it is a chemical
A	yeah
B	I wasn't speaking to him and have you seen the pictures up on Facebook?
A	yeah he vapes quite a lot doesn't he
B	yeah
A	in The Philippines
B	is that what those cloud smokes are then? it's just really weird is that was this smoke clouds are?
A	he's definitely into it
B	yeah
A	anyway do you want to smoke this cigarette
B	yes
A	yeah do you want to smoke it out there?
B	yeah do we smoke it in the kitchen and then out of the window will be better
A	in the kitchen maybe
B	I don't remember where the ashtray went have you seen it?
A	no I haven't the ashtray either
B	I know we need to wash up
A	lovely
B	I dislike the mess
A	I know it's a bit of a
B	downer
A	yeah it's something they should have told us I mean
B	yeah I know what I couldn't see what that was from
A	it's not something you expect
B	unless it's someone's cos it's right next to the nursery that pub thing and we never saw anything that looked like a pub did we so it's either someone's garden or it's a bed and breakfast or something there is a bottle of beer out on one of the tables
A	there is
B	yeah
A	as we said hopefully it will erm once the weather gets worse
B	yeah that's true it is the summer
A	they won't come out there as much
B	mind you when it's really nice people do sit in their garden
A	yeah I would hope so it's very nice isn't it
B	we've both
A	have you been fed up with having pocket-fulls of change since you returned?
B	well I don't I keep it in a purse er
A	quite infuriating
B	well I've been almost putting almost everything on my card so I don't break change very often
A	have you?
B	I used the money when it's something
A	are we gonna still get a joint account?
B	mm
A	do you think we just join one account or we're go and get a new account? be good to have a Santander account
B	I guess if we want a Santander account then we can just open
A	and we've got more chance of getting one
B	and then we can just for er
A	yeah
B	like I don't know whether or not if we open a joint one to close the
A	yeah I mean if we get if we open a joint one and have still got the Nationwide one
B	mm
A	separate then I'm going to shut
B	is there a limit? are you allowed to just keep opening bank accounts?
A	yeah I think you can have as many as you want
B	mm
A	don't think it matters
B	I think I've got one with Natwest somewhere from my old student account
B	if they're inactive
A	no activity yeah
B	I should perhaps contact them at some point
A	put in some money every so often I mean you don't need Natwest
B	I certainly haven't received anything from them for a long time
A	they probably just presume
B	a bit of spam mail
A	those children sound possessed
B	yeah it's just children
A	they really do
B	my niece for her eighth birthday had rented like the church hall and they'd paid for this like entertainment group to come and they come in the Frozen theme it's going to be a Frozen theme birthday
A	that will be good
B	they they er we could go to it of course for the second week we'll be here
A	yeah maybe best
A	no
B	it doesn't sound like much fun and
A	she's a mother she has to do that kind of stuff
B	yeah I think they enjoy it it's fine
A	the sound of seagulls it would have been nice to have had some nice weather
B	I know I'm hoping between now and before our course starts we'll get a couple of days and we can stroll down to the to the seafront maybe sit on the beach
A	it would be nice to go and sit out in the park yeah yeah that would be lovely wouldn't it
B	mm
A	that should be the last one of these today
B	yeah
A	maybe split one more later
B	I didn't get to the room and get my coffee with it did I
A	oh did you not?
B	it just went so quickly
A	just talking sorry
B	no it's okay it's because the coffee's hot isn't it
A	we have washing up liquid do we have any washing up sponges?
B	mm we've got dishcloths which are better
A	dishcloth but no sponges
B	because they they last so much longer oh we've got tea towels
A	are we keeping the eggs out?
B	no they stay in the fridge
A	do they?
B	yeah we keep eggs in the fridge once you buy them
A	once you buy them
B	but I mean once I mean to be honest probably if we want to save on fridge space in the long run
A	this this needs
B	we're not going to be able to store batches and stuff too easily are we once we've bought our fruit and veg
A	yeah it's going to take up a good deal of space we're going to have to live more hand to mouth I think I'm alright
B	yeah we should try to go out the I don't think the I
A	it doesn't?
B	we'll try it in the end you try
A	yeah run that one
B	shall I put this one on?
A	are we calling this for now?
B	yeah
A	more later
