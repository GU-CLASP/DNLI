A	did you see this thing? Have I showed you this before?
B	no what is it?
A	it's a word cloud
B	oh yeah taken from your own that's your own corpus that you made is it?
A	no it's my thesis
B	oh thesis itself
A	I thought I might frame it or something as a little reminder
A	eG's quite big
B	but they haven't got n-grams and if they did there'd probably be in terms of like about uh
A	you can
B	it'd be better if they did that and then made it like um like a classifier classified it in terms of where they are
A	oh yeah
B	merge in the n-grams
A	I should definitely put that in it'll probably come out like massive won't it?
B	doesn't like so you've got like
A	and
B	mm
A	well it's free it's online
B	perhaps
A	I put the Bible in as well just to see
B	oh that'd be really
A	so not not just because I'm
B	you could use like  you could use like  K F N-gram to get uh
A	yeah
B	to get your
A	yeah
B	Cos uh yeah for that thing I was telling you yesterday
A	yeah
B	is to change it after directly after Berkeley
A	yeah
B	then um uh as soon as  as soon as
A	ah your problem with the thing
B	yeah that that means that I would wanna change it as soon as Berkeley splits it out
A	yeah
B	I need unfortunately I need a list of every single word so that I can swap them
A	well that's okay I can do that
B	it will probably come in handy later actually I imagine that list
A	so but you can add in like um n-grams by you know that  you know that you know that you know that  thing?
B	yeah and semantic tagging?
A	what's that symbol that looks like that? Like that?
B	A tilde
A	A tilde
B	yeah in mathematics does it mean approximately or something?
A	I'm not sure
A	I did use the King James one well done
B	could use the Tyndale one
A	and I put like um Sense and
B	hey I tell you I can tell you two people who'd be quite interested in seeing that I mean
A	well I'll do one for when they come round and then
B	I know they they cos like these sorts of things um really is the the sort of way isn't it?
A	well it's just all it's just free it's called Wordle online and you just  you just  well you can either link to a webpage and it'll um tell you all of the things or you can just paste in loads of text and I pasted my whole thesis in so
B	yeah
A	I'll not say how many thousand words cos that's contentious
B	well how can a number how can a count of anything be contentious?
A	well because it was a little bit under what it should've been wasn't it?
B	I dunno I mean I I never officially counted it myself but I can only
A	oh did you not? I counted it with
B	um I can only speculate them
A	well it was  it was  just about on the lower limit but I counted like every scrap of text like all of the bibliography and everything
B	yeah
A	that was a bit naughty
B	it's what you
A	yeah
B	which uh you know sometimes I suppose some of the constructions you used were maybe a bit more verbose than they could've been but uh
A	well you you tried to root those out
B	but I the key thing with your one was getting the SVO order and getting the verb early
A	yeah I know I'm like a non-native speaker
B	getting the finite gotta get that finite verb early so that
A	I know
B	I dunno I suppose in German they they always put the finite verb it can can end up right at the very end
A	yeah maybe I'm more German than you think
B	yeah
A	maybe I just
B	no because you don't speak like that that's the thing
A	I know
B	I think you're just trying to overwork
A	well that's
B	on the subject of PhDs someone had to resign didn't they
A	who?
B	uh the President of
A	president of Hungary?
B	he's had to resign
A	why?
B	because his PhD thesis was fake
A	was it? Like Gillian O'Keith's? Gillian McKeith's?
B	I don't think hers was fake I think it just wasn't a thesis I think she just paid money and got a PhD
A	well she bought it didn't she? She looks at turds anyway
B	uh
B	no someone else was accused of it
A	aha
B	but no no he
A	and actually
B	in fact you've got
A	excuse me
B	uh his name was Pal Schmidt
A	Ohh
B	yeah
A	for the dinner for the sauce?
B	like d'you want that or do you want uh um something more spicy?
A	uh I dunno what we gonna have?
B	yeah
A	um
B	that's what  that's what  my idea was yeah
A	I can go and get some
B	ah well you know I was just sort of getting things
A	ah right no we'll
B	it it did actually um
A	so
B	so so yeah I mean so there's a lot of things you can do
A	how can that even be the case?
B	there's only his copy which he he doesn't want anyone to see
A	the one in the
B	yeah yeah the university's copy yeah
A	yeah but you can request to see it can't you?
B	but um and someone someone from paper or some blog had managed to you know do some research work and get and obtain the other copy
A	yeah
B	uh it was an economics paper like uh maybe Bloomberg or something I dunno
A	yeah
B	it was difficult had a lot of formulas and that's always suspicious it's um you know?
A	yeah overly difficult
B	like if you're using extra formulas to try and sort of confuse people but uh
A	yeah
B	I think he Greenspan's was uh was was okay it's just that I think he
A	yeah
B	he was just
A	mm
B	 eral Reserve Bank thing
A	have you still not eaten that chocolate from the other day?
B	yeah this is from  this is from  uh it's from Saturday this is innit
A	God I dunno how you can
B	and Friday
A	D'you know what man if you don't eat that it'll
A	yeah stockpile? You you're like panic buying
B	yeah
A	oh that's alright it's
B	it's funny with gold cos you can't really eat it well you can like uh you can have gold leaf yeah but it would take you quite a long time to eat your way through like a whole
A	there is edible gold leaf
B	the problem with that is that you're sort of destroying the gold aren't you cos like once you've eaten it it's not really possible to
A	but does it come out though? It can't just like
B	your uh your word cloud on this is gonna be good isn't it?
A	me what?
B	you know
A	on this conversation?
B	the yeah if you stick it through there it's gonna come out with like Alan Greenspan and like uh
A	yeah
B	uh eating gold and retrieving the gold after it's been eaten
A	well
B	I I dunno how much gold gold leaf you could get out of uh
A	where's your cup
B	like I wonder how many miles or sort of square metres of gold leaf you can get out of like a
A	A bullion? One bullion thing?
B	yeah
A	no it'll be on the
A	I don't really like gold anyway
B	you mean the like the look of it?
A	sorry
B	uh darts darts presenters
A	darts presenters definitely
A	chavs like gold
A	no I'm just  I'm just  saying what it reminds me of
B	yeah
A	I'm just saying I don't because I think it reminds me of nanas and chavs
B	was was it you who
A	ah I think we were talking about it the other day
B	yeah that's pretty uh
A	clowns?
B	and like the idea of getting that I guess it comes from America I mean
A	they were really big when I was at school
B	one what?
A	it was
B	that's tremendous
A	with diamantes
B	those are fake diamonds right?
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah no it doesn't with me
A	no
B	yeah
A	unusual ones and stuff but they just itch my ear so much
B	oh
A	bit of a shame
B	kind of even
A	no it's it's not the  it's not the  material it's the um it's having something in me ear in my ear holes if you know what I mean
B	yeah
A	so yeah there's that and then um I've never liked like floppy like you know bracelets and stuff?
B	uh
A	I like a bangle but I don't like a  I don't like a  like a floppy one that much
B	yeah
A	um
A	I think it's nickel
B	producing producing some copper sulphate or something?
A	or copper probably the
B	like cupronickel uh whatever it's called
A	it does turn them green yeah
B	I think so
A	it's a bit sort of um Bollywood inspired
B	right
A	it um that turned me whole finger green
A	well
B	it's uh interesting how it goes from being you know such a
A	yeah
B	to dye  to dye  the
A	well I don't know it's just one of these like
B	yeah
A	you know things that people do
B	yeah
A	but it's not made of copper but it has like pressure points
B	yeah
A	I don't know if they work either though
A	am I in the way is this what you're saying?
B	no no no no
A	was it a speech act?
B	not at all
A	no no no
B	your uh pragmatic module is uh
A	ooh the
B	that's cos it's totally
A	you did
B	utterly
A	it's the the dead one
B	that was Saturday
A	I thought it was the
B	ah so you mean it's uh?
A	look
B	made um a copy
A	yeah it's like Schmantene
B	but it says uh pro vitamin on it
A	they had all of them
B	yeah well you got to cos in this you know in this
A	pardon?
B	in this economic climate you know
A	yeah
B	you've got to appeal to the  to the  the cheapskate and the you know
A	well it's just the same juice inside I don't care what it says in the bottle really
B	the
A	yeah
B	um
A	solar power? Why?
B	um
A	are them things in the oven done?
B	like
A	na they take ages to heat through a lot of the time
B	yeah I reckon they're done now
A	well
B	uh yeah
A	if you want
B	yeah no problem
A	just close the window for a while
B	oh yeah yeah
A	should I bring? Ah can I have  can I have  some tomato sauce?
B	could eat it on the
A	um
B	so you don't like eating pasties standing like at a Gregg's?
A	um
B	yeah
A	but yeah
A	sorry?
B	like um
A	it would raise the
A	to raise the profile? That's what they say isn't it like that um any publicity's good publicity
B	yeah except like Bin Laden or something
A	D'you wanna come through or? Shall I just?
B	yeah
A	they'll be alright
B	well um I'll leave them on
A	I dunno if I can carry that and that
B	I'll take  I'll take  that
A	come back for it
A	have I left the remote
B	hold that I'm just getting the salt actually
A	I'm sorry
A	I wonder if
A	oh
B	sorry not Scum Dine With Me
A	no
B	I think that's really really loud on the uh recording when it it tips over
A	well
B	well
B	um think with the number four innit?
A	oh it's not on
A	Matt?
B	yeah
A	what you doing?
B	just sorting out
A	pardon
B	just uh sorting out these onions
A	shall I press pause?
B	uh no I
A	Matt? You're not sorting out onions
A	you want me to press stop?
B	uh no no I'm alright I'll just get
A	I picked up that bit of pasty to have a bite of and like every single bit of filling fell out the middle
B	oh right
A	it's quite peppery it's nice
B	well um yeah we need to go to a trip somewhere um so I thought
A	yeah
B	Ely but also um
A	oh that might be nice
B	what here?
A	here
B	it's gonna snow in in April?
A	apparently
B	mm
A	apparently it's snowing in Scotland at the moment
B	oh
A	no
B	but the the yeah I mean
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	no I know
B	yeah cos we're it seems very precarious like I think a few  a few  of the wrong you know butterflies flapping their wings or whatever
A	yeah
B	and
A	yeah
B	appear on top of the country
A	well it is supposed to be like storms and hailstones and stuff
B	so um need to do more technology to improve uh the ability to control the weather
A	well
B	um yeah I think there there are things that can sort of
A	they put like hot air
B	basically just a big fan that just blows blows the clouds away?
A	yeah
B	I guess you could
A	or did they make it rain so that it wouldn't be as pollution-y
B	yeah that that may well have been um
A	can't remember
B	basically just blow the bad um air away
A	yeah
B	replace it with good air
A	are you looking forward to the Olympics this time?
B	um
A	is it not?
B	in in you know my dreams or anything but uh
A	it's not in my dreams either but
B	I think it could be entertaining and
A	yeah
B	oh yeah I've gotta get
A	yeah
B	sort of extensively
A	yeah
B	sort of not watching anything else just that
A	well
B	oh yeah yeah I mean obviously with
A	yeah
B	I mean if you're asking which meridian uh is the best for the most people um
A	well
B	which which um you know
A	line of latitude
B	which line of um
B	uh
A	I never remember the difference
B	um
A	time zone?
B	Cos that's it which latitude has the most people on it? Which time zone has the most people?
A	well let's think
B	um probably the one that goes all the way down Africa
A	that's GMT isn't it goes through like
B	oh um
A	goes through Lisbon doesn't it? And Dublin?
B	no I think it comes out over the the round part of Africa I mean
A	doesn't it? Oh does it? Maybe European Central Time then?
B	or
A	yeah
B	then if you're going down through through Spain then kinda cut through the round you know Maghreb West African bit
A	yeah
B	if you wanna get it right down like you know from from yeah from like  from like
A	but then America I mean
B	into South Africa
[ANNOTATION]	person B is talking about weather	Contradiction
A	obviously it can't go through the middle of America but South America but you know what I mean
B	uh you could  you could  try and get which one like with a one with a lot of cities on them
A	yeah
B	um
A	it lists don't it like on my phone when you wanna change the time zone it lists like the options
B	you could try and get Mexico City and like
A	yeah
B	and
A	in fact I think ours does
B	isn't that? I dunno if that goes down to to like if you get Buenos Aires and like in terms of time zones I mean
A	I don't know
[ANNOTATION]	person B is talking about Mexico city	Entailment
B	um
A	was that pasty nice?
B	there are a lot of people in like you got west coast and east coast of America probably got a lot of people in there but also
A	yeah
B	but perhaps China and India could could um produce Bangladesh or Indonesia or something like that
A	have more?
[ANNOTATION]	they do not know some country can produce	Neutral
B	um perhaps you could get like a
A	dunno
B	oh yeah they will have
A	definitely
B	um well so it's like a pub quiz question innit?
A	yeah it is
B	which uh
A	no the
[ANNOTATION]	the question is about work	Contradiction
B	yeah some of it's a bit crazy I mean
A	yeah
B	that's great
A	it's silly
B	um
A	yeah
B	um you know
[ANNOTATION]	person B know  some of them is crazy	Entailment
A	hm? Not fond of that name
B	you've got
A	yeah
B	and I think there may be more
A	mm don't like it
B	um
A	but I'm glad that
B	oh yeah so he's moved from
A	yeah
B	so
A	but he's gonna call her
B	fair enough
A	what?
B	is that that song?
A	what song?
B	is it the one that goes uh
A	I need a bit more
B	ah
A	what?
B	hey there
A	I don't know
B	ah it's a sixties  it's a sixties  film
A	oh
B	I don't know if it's
A	have to look it up
B	are those onions alright?
A	I think they'll be fine yeah
B	yeah that's why I was checking it
A	is it like number one though?
B	it's it's okay yeah
A	hey that aloes come looks really good doesn't it? Looks better than it was before I knocked him spectacularly
B	yeah um
A	I need to change the soil though you said it was a bit stinky
B	it's mouldy it's like um
A	smell
B	well they it just the soil just had that in it and
A	yeah
B	so it'd still have that smell uh even if it's  even if it's  really dry or even if it's not it'd still have that smell
A	yeah
B	same thing yeah so if we went to the coast where would we  where would we  go?
A	I dunno cos I've never  I've never  been round here before like
B	might have to stay a night
A	dunno if I've got
B	well um
A	yeah we have actually that's true
B	um hopefully hopefully in the near future
A	well maybe we should
B	well I dunno I mean depends where you
A	where were you thinking of?
B	oh uh this was just
A	conjecture
B	um
A	shall I put this light on actually?
B	I mean you want somewhere like uh in the uh in
A	yeah
B	that's all the more reason to go then isn't it?
A	well it is
B	um
A	could go to
A	yeah
B	well I think Norwich sounds like the the less rougher of those two
A	well I've never been
B	um
A	Liz went to uni there I'll ask her
B	Cos it's south
A	UAE Norwich
B	Norwich yeah
A	it's got like a
B	um you actually have been there haven't you?
A	I have been there
B	and I only very very briefly have been there
A	yeah
B	that's probably the one of the most obvious ones uh could go to like a part of London that we haven't seen
A	yeah
B	as much
A	yeah but it's it's
B	like um
A	maybe
B	uh
A	I dunno we went there not long ago though
B	well yeah I was just thinking that there's a lot of different bits of London to see aren't there?
A	no no I know
B	yeah well uh good to um maximize the London experience
A	yeah
B	I mean part of the
A	yeah
B	so it's only um
A	mm depends when you go less
B	um the bus that's really  that's really  pleasantly cheap but uh
A	return?
B	um
A	yeah six pounds
B	the train  the train  would be uh one would be uh
A	I'm sure they do
B	yeah we can that'd be that wouldn't take too long would it or?
A	Don't think so
B	no it's okay I mean
A	well only cos we get off early
B	were are you a bit sick of you a bit bored of London?
A	oh I don't I think you can't be bored of London can you really?
B	yeah cos I was just think you know like he who tires of London tires of life or whatever
A	exactly
B	I mean
A	no but I just mean it's good to go I've seen a bit of London
B	yeah
B	no it just sounds it sounds rough but I don't know if it is
A	what are them places by the sea called like
B	it's near
A	should see where the train  the train  goes
B	it's got a sea life centre
A	excellent
A	is it a port?
B	yeah it's a  it's a  ferry thing
A	oh did you?
B	painfully
B	I think that was no that was it was that
A	yeah
B	I've forgotten
A	Don't know
B	where's
A	well it's along that way because that the sign's like when we come if we came off the M6 to come here the signs say like
A	that sounds like a little bit of a long estimate
B	hm
A	ah yeah
B	it's it's it's Kent yeah it's um near by near
A	yeah
B	um and it's and it might be near Hastings I'm not sure
A	yeah
B	you know probably
A	I'm not sure
B	um
A	but I do like the East
B	so uh d'you wanna do you want me to turn off them onions and?
A	no
B	yeah I've actually got a Nice biscuit here
A	I've got a nice Nice biscuit
B	I guess you're supposed to say neece
A	that's what me nana always said but then you said nice so I thought it was nice
B	nice
A	that would be nice Nice
B	oh that's actually your accent isn't it?
A	no I'd never say that
B	it's actually uh how people speak in the uh the
A	nice is gonna come out as a collocate of Nice isn't it?
B	what?
A	we said them in a row too many times
B	oh right yeah
A	capital N for Nice though isn't it?
B	yeah
A	ooh they're not gonna last very long
B	they're sorta shortbread aren't they?
A	very sweet
B	um
A	Good isn't it?
B	I don't think you could seriously have driven with a dog like
A	he's got a little his lead's attached yeah
B	but when it falls off with the momentum like the dog's gonna get dragged behind it like
A	mm
B	well I think it they I think they're just  I think they're just  um well looks like a type of terrier doesn't it?
A	no it's got curly  it's got curly  hair
B	yes um don't some terriers have that?
A	do they? Is it not like a poodle-y thing?
B	um
A	I like its  I like its  hairdo whatever kind of dog it is
B	I'm not  I'm not  sure actually you'd have to we'd have to get the smartphone
A	ooh I'm sorry
B	no I reckon they set that photo up just for the
A	well of course they did
A	it's not some picture of someone like driving down the street is it?
B	well it might've been they might've found it in an archive
A	duh
B	it might've been in an archive somewhere
A	I very much doubt it
B	they uh spent ages uh
A	so what's going in?
B	we could look look look for clues in uh in the photo to see it's a modern thing
A	I don't know
B	this is like carrot
A	oh right
B	although
A	yeah no carrot's okay I normally
B	it seemed to just go with like a sort of Holy Trinity thing
A	yeah
B	um we don't have any celery
A	mm
