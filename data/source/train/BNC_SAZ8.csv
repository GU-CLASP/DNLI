B	what kind of things are you doing in linguistics study?
A	just general ELT style stuff really
B	so is it searching out seeing what kind of words people use? Or how they use words or?
A	how they well yeah how how you use words or kind of grammatical constructions that actually still used rather than just taught in grammar lessons and
B	okay
A	that sort of thing
B	mm
A	yep
A	oh the OED allows them now so
B	mm
A	must be
B	mm
A	I have got more ideas than that
B	I guess we need to think about whether we want to do it on a friend or foe
A	mm
B	um
A	mm
B	that there are
A	yeah that's that's a good point cos I hadn't thought about that
B	mm
A	I don't know what to do
B	go on
A	I think it's one way to live one way to die
B	yeah
A	so I don't know
B	I guess it's two ways to live at the moment isn't it
A	mhm
B	mm
A	talk time
B	it was shorter than my one I think
A	yeah well yours was recap
B	yeah that's true
A	okay
B	um
A	it's just then though we've got the flowers to do and the
B	mm
A	we're not actually gonna have that much time
B	so we've got snacks
A	yes
B	and then go into small groups and pray and share prayer and share
A	and can get over the whole discussion of what colour you like first
B	I should just do like come in on one Friday and just make ten more sets
A	um so er er oh brain
B	think that's too short? I think if we have more than twenty-five minutes that bit's getting quite
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	mm
A	er
B	Cos the boys were quite quick
A	mhm
B	yeah
A	that's a challenge
unknown_female	hiya
A	hi
B	it takes quite a long time to make the flowers
A	how many are they making? Er for the morning both morning services?
B	I assume so
A	I think we need to end on a good game
B	yeah
A	otherwise they'll think why did we bother
B	we could have do the flowers and then do a very quick game
A	mm
B	if we don't finish praying till then but
A	mm
B	what we could do though is we could if we pray quite quickly and then set up the flowers
A	yeah
B	in the flowers
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	so in that case we don't need  we don't need  a intro game
B	no
A	uh-huh
B	um
B	or something
A	oh you mean that even if they aren't gonna get a choice whether they rebel?
B	well they could can't they
A	I just just completely forget what I'm supposed to be doing normally
B	yeah
A	but no I like it
B	but that's kind of on theme
A	mhm
B	and it's kinda short and long
A	mhm
B	um
A	Cos you you know you can  you can  make that as elaborate as or as simple as you like
B	yeah
A	mm
B	um
A	live this way or live that way
B	yeah
A	only cos my
B	mm
A	um put around the room various um I don't know like superheroes
B	mhm
A	or whatever and their nemeses and their sidekicks
A	whether it's a pair or not
B	but you could do that as the quiet game
A	mm
B	you could have pictures and facts on bits of paper and they've got to match them up
A	mhm
B	and you can match them all up
A	that would  that would  be nice and quiet
B	would be nice and quiet and it'd be quite fun
A	A bit woolly
A	er
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	they were nice last year
B	cellophane thing
A	mm
B	I think we should allow half an hour
A	er yeah but there's it's all movable
B	yeah
A	I just
B	it's just good starting off with it
A	noisy big game
B	so the other ideas I had
A	mhm
B	because that's kind of friend or foe like
B	I haven't worked out how exactly that would work
A	I'd love to see them burrowing through people's legs
B	together?
A	yeah
B	it could be a game
A	getting very friendly
B	you can  you can  get people yeah exactly
A	uh-huh
B	all kinds of things
A	how you seen that work? What?
B	well no I just
A	mhm
B	again that's something we could do which doesn't take much prep
A	yeah
B	hello
unknown_female	oh
A	very early
B	yeah
unknown_female	oh
B	we've come to eat the Mini Rolls and flapjacks actually
unknown_female	ah
A	hm
unknown_female	you don't have another key? My key's at Tesco being recut
B	I don't have a key for that one I'm afraid
unknown_female	no
B	sadly
unknown_female	yes
B	it would be very useful
unknown_female	I know
B	but I don't
unknown_female	well
B	there's probably a key in the filing cabinet where the spare keys are kept
unknown_female	true
B	yeah
unknown_female	oh
unknown_female	are you doing your Pathfinder planning?
B	yeah
A	mm
unknown_female	mm
B	um
B	this was before I got to my choices thing
unknown_female	see you soon
B	all the teams
A	see you
unknown_female	bye
B	um
A	what is our memory verse?
B	it's um
B	it's about something like um tut
A	mhm
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B has a lot of memory verses.	Neutral
B	mm
A	mm
B	so they don't know which
A	so you could have them set up at the either side of the room
B	yeah
A	no just thinking out now
B	yeah
A	so would they huh would this have to come before
[ANNOTATION]	Some thoughts run though speaker's A mind.	Entailment
A	question of the week?
B	um
A	I was just thinking if they were doing hangman
B	yes but you see there's quite there's er you know it just means that actually cos you here once you have E get all the Es
A	ah and there's a lot of Os
[ANNOTATION]	This is the 30th week of the year.	Neutral
B	and there's a lot of Os
A	uh-huh
B	it has Js and Vs and Bs
A	mhm
B	then even if they started with those
A	I like it
B	but if we're doing it before the question of the week that probably means it doesn't
A	how yeah we need to make it so would they have something to do in their groups in order
B	yeah
A	and they in which case it would need to be quite snappy
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Something speakers organise doesn't have to be really brisk.	Contradiction
A	they definitely need to run
B	they definitely need to run
A	um
B	um so realistically how many might we have? How many teams might we need to have? Maximum four teams
A	it's normally three
B	I mean you could have one lot in the cr√©che um with the doors open but so that the words kind of
[ANNOTATION]	The maximum number of teams is not 6.	Entailment
A	yeah
B	um with one curtain closed
A	mhm
B	is that enough running?
A	so they start from there
B	but we could introduce a bit more running by them running to get the place where you get letters from and then going back again
A	oh
B	is what I was thinking
A	uh-huh
B	um but it's not very far for them to run but it's some distance for them to run
A	mhm
B	just one
A	uh-huh
B	um which somehow they've got to do without the others seeing
A	do you this is
A	just to introduce a bit of choice
B	yes
A	could they do something where if they they can either come and ask for for a letter
B	yes
A	or they can ask for a riddle or a challenge or something and if they
B	oo
A	so the they can take the time and speed things up perhaps depending on their ability
B	or if they get the question right they get two letters
A	no but they have to cotton onto that
A	no
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	um
A	no and running twenty-six times back and forth is not going to take too long anyway
B	no
A	right should we
B	should we just scrap that instead of Simon Says and do Simon Says?
A	and then memory verse
B	okay
A	or two fun games
B	two fun games
A	we haven't played dwarfs giants thingies for a while
B	no
A	that's true
A	maybe we
B	I just realized that
A	but
B	maybe it's epistemologically too tight
A	mm
B	um
A	hm
B	maybe we should just do giants wizards and dwarfs because it
A	mhm
B	yeah
A	um
B	and basically they're always foe unless they are the same
A	yes
B	is that right?
A	yes
B	Cos they're friends
A	yep
B	what happens if you have three teams?
A	that could be qiute fun
B	okay
A	it could be chaos
B	let's just think whether or not that will actually work logistically
A	the basic principle is just run
B	run
A	mm
B	I think it'll take too long won't it
A	long
B	hello
unknown_female	hiya
B	yeah I think you're right
A	I am rubbish tonight
A	it's not really a running around game
B	mhm
A	but I just wondered about something where they had um they had to basically sort themselves out into teams um by a sort of twenty questions sort of scenario where they wander round
B	hm
A	who they're with
B	mm
A	or for the choices thing something where
B	I thought about battleships cos I heard quite recently where if you go where you could have friendly fire somehow
B	enemy fire and friendly fire with
A	or Mafia
B	or Mafia
A	oh let's play Mafia
B	okay
A	er how long is a piece of string?
B	Great
A	mhm
B	Cos it's a sitting down game isn't it
A	yeah
B	but it's fun
A	it'll also depend on their age
B	okay
B	if we need to
A	that's true
B	I'll put that back up
A	mm
B	excellent
A	mhm
B	Cos I don't know how to do that
A	cool
B	um
A	mhm
B	and
A	excellent
B	Great
A	and a final question
B	oh I'd love you to cook
B	I think it's meant to be my turn but I would love that
A	okay
B	or this  or this  week even
A	er how many people should I prepare for?
B	mm
A	mhm
B	and have smaller portions if need be
A	okay
B	but it's like ten normal portions
A	cook more carbs
B	yeah exactly
A	mm
B	is that alright?
A	mhm
A	I like having two weeks' notice
B	yeah exactly you've got it means you've got a good amount of weekend to do it in
A	well I haven't but
B	okay
A	I can do it next week
B	okay
A	yep
B	that's wonderful
A	mm
