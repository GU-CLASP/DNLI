J	it is an
B	what? so what's your argument
A	well there are there are single sex couples who have adopted
unknown	was this was this
unknown_female	mm maybe not no
B	er not single sex single parents
A	well there'd be a few years because there are erm some celebrities have in a same sex marriage and they've adopted and there's been pictures of them so
unknown_female	yeah yeah
J	oh yeah
unknown_female	he was like
A	yeah
J	before we've actually seen what happens it might well be that the kids come out absolutely wonderfully
unknown_female	I know that
unknown_female	okay
unknown_female	you know cos I know they'd be just as good parents
unknown_female	yeah
unknown_female	but whether they could provide both role models
B	but like I said what about single parents?
J	well yeah that's a similar thing but that's that's
B	cos then they've only got one adult contributing to their whereas if you've got two separate personalities
A	well I think that's I think that's where we disagree because I don't agree with there being with kids being
unknown_female	erm brought up with erm like stereotypical gender roles
unknown_female	I don't think there's erm I saw a video where some I don't know how accurate it is but some people in Sweden are erm raising their children where they're not
unknown_female	mm
unknown_female	saying the boy should have
unknown_female	toy cars and the girls shouldn't have Barbie dolls and I don't think that the gender roles should matter I think as long as the parents erm raise them fairly and
D	right yeah
A	then I feel I don't think that it should be a problem
unknown_female	if you look
unknown_female	I mean I don't we don't know do we? so it could I could be wrong but personally I don't think it should matter as long as the kids are brought up fairly
B	if you look you were
unknown	and things to burn and kill and
unknown_female	yeah yeah and set fire to
A	no it's not you but it's a collective
unknown_female	mm
B	what I'm trying to say is that I I think gender dictates itself in a way
unknown	I'm getting a train
A	I I don't agree
A	I think it's mainly
C	any surface you'd push a car along
unknown_female	mm
unknown_female	push a train along
unknown_female	you didn't think about buying a boys thing for me because you've been
B	those toys were already in the house the first toys you'd experienced were his toys
A	yeah but right fair enough
A	but afterwards you wouldn't have
unknown_female	I'm not gonna give her a male toy I'm gonna
B	no
B	no
unknown_female	my sister she didn't want to push any male stereotypes on
A	yeah
J	so she deliberately kept kept the house neutral
J	and he immediately gravitated towards boys toys
unknown_female	yeah
unknown_female	now I can't say it's
unknown_female	hello
unknown_female	how are you?
unknown_female	I'm okay
unknown_female	yeah?
unknown_female	what he sees on telly he sees boys playing with boys toys girls playing with girls toys
unknown_female	yeah
unknown_female	so you can't totally say that it's inner
B	weather wasn't too bad was it?
unknown_female	yeah
E	bit greasy up on the top of the
B	oh I bet it was yeah
J	but with a parent who was deliberately trying to avoid the bias she he
A	okay but that that could've been a coincidence
A	but that's I think I think
unknown_female	yes
unknown_female	yeah
unknown_female	I'm sure that they they've done they've experimented on things like this and they've shown that hello hello
H	hello
unknown_female	hello
unknown_female	right
J	Merry Christmas

H	the way that they chose the time of year was they thought at Christmas people usually like they've already travelled like they don't it's they've already got the time off
B	yeah
H	to to travel and go somewhere they've already probably got new outfits so they don't have to like spend more money on new outfits
unknown_female	oh yeah
unknown_female	they sort of tried to do it in the most cost-efficient way especially as the bride's son's getting married in May
unknown_female	so
unknown_female	ah
J	and he's got no excuse now to forget the wedding anniversary it'll be
unknown_female	mm
