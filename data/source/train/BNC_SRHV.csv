C	I have like no money
A	yeah but they just take forever to do it
C	yeah I phoned them up and
A	and then like I tried ringing them now and they said because because so many people are owed tax that when I rang them they were like if you are just owed tax if if you have overpaid please don't ring us we'll get round to it and I was like well when is that gonna be? you can't just say that and then leave people waiting for years like
B	yeah you can't
A	and I I got like twenty fifty quid back that was due like a year and a half ago only before I started this term as well
C	I know what's fifty
A	fifty quid is a lot

A	exactly
C	in terms of like your income and stuff
A	yeah
C	if not you wouldn't have bothered doing the work
A	I mean it was like it happened last time as well it's cos when I keep going back to Matalan at Christmas erm they keep taxing me and I told them the first time and they said
C	they need to put your erm are they keep on putting you on an emergency tax code?
A	I don't know
C	I think that's what it is
A	I honestly don't know
C	erm
A	but they said last time that it won't happen next time and then it did and then cos I worked a lot last over summer
C	yeah
A	erm
C	it happened again
A	I'm owed like a hundred quid cos I've been taxed for it all
C	do you have some scissors?
A	yeah
C	well if you tell me then I'll get them

C	yeah it's just weird that she comes from
A	did she go back last year?

C	I know it's not weird but it is weird cos you never like I just never really think oh she's from Ghana
B	yeah she's an international student
B	you never think like that do you?
C	no I always think that she is properly from
A	I think it's just weird because she's been here for so long it's not just like she moved here just for uni
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	like she was here for school and everything
B	exactly but she still counts as international oh go on yeah great finish
C	yeah I think I think that is it isn't it? cos like
A	yeah
C	whereas I would have thought
B	yeah
C	UK like
A	yeah same
C	so
B	no worries mate any time
C	oh that's perfect there we go erm nowhere to go
B	yellow card I will punch you
A	yellow card?
B	yeah it was a yellow card
A	oh well actually there was a yellow card yesterday that I found so
B	no no no
A	no you got to let me punch you
B	but I wasn't in your presence when you saw it that's not fair
A	oh that's nice though I like it
B	that is good
A	I like home made ones
C	literally like how like made till all the glitter dried put little sequins
A	that's really cute
B	how did you deal with the power cut like when you actually had the power off?
A	er well the power went off at night so we just went to bed me and
B	nice
A	did you have candles and stuff?
C	no we didn't have candles
B	how the fuck did you survive?
A	did you just go to sleep really early then?
C	yeah and I just slept in really late and then actually no I didn't sleep in late because I I needed to do my coursework and I had an exam and I was really stressed about it all
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	erm so I got up at eight thirty I was at the bus station at eight thirty and then when I realised there was no chance of getting a bus I went around had a walk round town to look at it and saw where the flood was
A	mm
C	erm I talked to my ex
B	lucky
C	about four o'clock when yours was all still out
B	it was about two o'clock actually cos you came round ours before two
A	mm
B	and you said you had power
C	oh that was it what what happened at four o'clock then I feel that something?
B	so it went off again the next day at four o'clock didn't it?
C	yeah that's it that's it it went off at four the next day erm yeah so it came on about two yeah
B	yeah
C	er we looked at the Twitter page we were fine by two
B	I was like how did you look at the Twitter? then I realised you had power
C	yeah
A	yeah but didn't yours didn't yours come on for a bit and then go off again?
B	yeah
C	well ours was on for like that day the next day but then it went off at four when yours was all on and the only way I dealed with that is I went to see my friend and then I came and sat with you for that night
B	mm yeah
C	and then it came back on by about eleven thirty I think eleven so that was alright
B	yeah not too bad
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	so erm I think initially as soon as the power came we just cooked because by that point I was really really hungry yeah proper
A	proper hungry
C	proper hungry
A	full name
B	damn it
A	you're still winning
B	I know but like if cos I'm a I'm a terrible team it's really easy to concede
A	how are you a terrible team if you're in the Premier League?
C	ah
B	like compared to everything else in the Premier League
B	er you're rank
C	I didn't do it on purpose
B	obviously not
B	oh my god what was that?
A	that was bad
B	that was bad
C	excuse me and sorry
A	it's alright no it's fine
B	that's alright we don't get bothered by that shit
C	ah ah ah
B	go on yes yes loving it yes
A	when do you go home
C	er well I'm going to Spain on Sunday aren't I?
B	yeah
A	oh Sunday okay
C	yeah so got work tonight
A	see like in one way it's really exciting but the other way you've got to actually do work there
C	yeah this is the thing it would have been a perfect way to end a term
A	mm
C	where I didn't have a week of like nilly filling around because I genuine haven't done a single piece of coursework this week haven't done any work
B	no same
C	haven't done any reading haven't really
A	I haven't done much I've done a little bit of reading that's it
C	yeah you see I needed to be productive it's really stupid of me not to have done it because now the amount that I have over Christmas isn't manageable versus if I got all my work done this week it would have been like I had it like a week to do each piece of coursework
A	mm
C	and I've already had like five thousand words I know you've got a lot of words haven't you? you've got seven thousand
A	I have seven thousand yeah
C	but the thing is with my words they're like some of those words are just very easy words but some of it is quite difficult whereas I feel like your words cos you're like essays and stuff
A	well one of erm
C	yeah
A	whereas with the two linguistics ones erm it's possible for me to kind of blag my way through which sounds weird
C	yeah
A	because one of them is basically just like the grammars of languages and you're basically just describing the languages and comparing them so there's not really like there's no theory involved
C	yeah
A	it's basically just reading one book for each language and then the other one is very it's an empirical one where I just have to do loads of data so
C	oh yeah that shouldn't be too bad
A	it shouldn't be too I have to compare it to a theory but it shouldn't be too bad it's just the sociology one
C	the sociology one yeah
A	it's going to be the hell
B	Tachla

B	look at that look at that like the keeper's coming to get it
C	er
B	banter
C	how did that goal work is did the wind pick up the ball?
B	no no no it was just it was just the fact that like he headed it towards it's just cos he headed it in he headed it in and he got in front of the keeper and just headed it past him
C	what? they're all just headering it
A	such a late reaction from the keeper just puts his hands up
B	no it's in slow motion it's like
A	I know but still
B	still yeah for a keeper he should have better reactions
A	yeah look he's already got it in by the time he's even
B	I know
A	yeah
B	but that's such a great goal such an opportunistic goal just I can get in here
A	head

C	team leader
B	team leader
C	er which are like mainly third years who've been there for a couple of years they get asked in their final years to be a team leader which is
B	team leader
C	they get paid more
B	yeah
C	erm to be in charge whilst you're closing up the shop
B	mm
C	because erm there's quite like there's a lot to do there's like all the tills all of the like making sure it's secured alarms and stuff
A	yeah
C	erm but they have had like I went in last night with
B	team leader
C	and we had to close up and tonight I'm in with
B	team leader
C	er and neither of us are getting paid to close it up properly but we haven't even had the training to like close it up properly
A	mm

A	what are they just short of staff is that why?
C	part of that but erm
A	oh yeah
C	but no there are a couple of there are like two team leaders
B	team leaders
C	around erm but they don't erm I dunno I thought
A	yeah
C	and the thing is when when people play into us because we won't give them alcohol cos they haven't got their ID cos they're complete dickheads erm that's problematic as well and you don't have a team leader who is like
B	team leader
C	the manager
