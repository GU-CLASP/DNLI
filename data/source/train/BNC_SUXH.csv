F	yeah
C	curiosity gets the better of him and he opens it up and he has a look inside
C	and he sees have I told you this?
F	no
C	he sees a hand
F	maybe a long time ago
C	a human hand so he nicks it
C	thinking
C	he can do something with it puts it in a bag they all go out for end of term drinks er and on the train it's for it the like the uni station going into
C	and they go the Prince of Wales pub and they're having a few drinks goes to get something out of his bag sees the hand and like closes it before the lecturer can see it
F	yeah
C	so he's got to get rid of it so he goes to the toilet you know the downstairs toilets?
F	yeah
C	with his backpack goes into the cubicle
C	turns out you can't flush a hand
F	you can't flush a cadaver's hand no
C	er so what do you do in this situation? just like every man would do just leave it
C	and he left it
B	walk away from the problem
A	can you imagine the poor next person?
C	no it was er apparently then he saw erm er like a cleaner go down to the toilet come back like ashen-faced have a word with the manager
C	and then nothing it's not like the police came in the pub it's not like they closed the doors it's just like
F	just like flushed it out
C	taken care of cos they don't want a they don't want a hand to be found in their toilet
F	no exactly
C	so it was taken care of
F	I once
C	is that a crisis?
B	that is a crisis
B	is that a crisis?
F	and I said and I tried to find someone and I said look I don't wanna make a scene but there's a wasp in you might just wanna
C	did you say

F	didn't get stung or anything but if someone opens it if a kid gets stung
C	you get stung every time you pay for pick and mix
F	but then it was just a
B	is that what you have to do now?
B	what the cuss did you just say to me?
C	I really like that I'm gonna use that
F	trying to get to people like to try and get the manager me to go in do I leave now? cos they're not haven't the can't not really handling it very well so

F	think so yeah went on holiday they went to er La Gomera the the Canary Islands
C	do you know in La Gomera they there's an official language which is whistling
F	really?
C	and they er used to shepherds used to do it to cos it travels further across like the mountains and the valleys to say it's a really poor agricultural or was islands to say there's a storm coming so they're all
C	like it's how do you is it it's a lightning storm or could have told you it's a storm but with gale or er snow like it really is a language rather than just like something's gonna happen and anyway that it almost died out obviously and now they're teaching it in schools so you go to a primary school in La Gomera and they're teaching them okay this means attention this means danger this means ignore the last thing I just said or whatever
C	and it's not with the hands it's just like all the all the males on the island has developed
A	only the males?
C	well they were the
A	okay
C	obviously travels quite a lot your dad
F	yeah he does
A	that's nice though that he's met someone
F	yeah it is really nice and they're really happy
A	are they seeing each other just like a nice amount rather than like
F	yeah
A	they moved in or anything like that
C	I think if that's a an hour and and twenty minutes away is the perfect distance for any relationship
A	yeah
F	it sort of I it makes me I dunno it's nice to see it's a bit sickening but they like hold
A	ah and what's her
C	couples aren't meant to hold hands
A	what's her story? how long has she been
F	she has been divorced I think for eleven years
A	right okay
F	and just not met anyone in that time
A	right
F	the dad is her her dad her the the the daughter's dad is from Chile
A	ah
F	and had to flee Pinochet
C	wow
A	wow
F	so that's why he came to
C	cool
F	to Britain
A	right
F	but they're obviously it didn't work out
C	yeah
F	but they're still friends and they kind of
C	escaped Pinochet and joined up with Thatcher
C	so the kids are like half Chilean?
C	another foreign name
F	yeah
A	but you think you got on well enough that when you have time together like
F	yeah I mean
A	it'll be fine? cos that's all you want it to be really
F	it's
C	mm
A	yeah
C	yeah
F	but yeah she was
A	yeah
F	and that's the
C	yeah
A	good
C	you can have a chat with a nineteen-year-old for about half an hour I think
F	yeah
A	is she'd probably be a
F	possibly I don't
C	she probably see thinks you're just ridiculously old
A	yeah
F	yeah I know
C	cos obviously like you're a young dad and all that but when you're nineteen you just think
F	and the the my dad's friends' sons obviously knew me and one's twenty and one's nineteen and it was just sort of like at first I thought I'm fine here

F	but yeah definitely
A	cos is he retired or is he still working?
F	semi-retired
A	yeah
F	so he doesn't work that much any more

unknown_female	what's gonna happen to the business?
unknown_female	really? you're not tempted? no? I thought you liked

C	yeah
F	I kind of like working with people and
A	yeah
F	talking to people
C	quite liked the manual side of it though didn't you?
F	yeah really liked that and it was really satisfying in that sense but
C	and he's got like quite a nice little client base isn't it?
F	yeah yeah yeah it's just it's not stimulating enough
A	there's nobody
C	yeah
A	he can who's interested? like no like apprentice like around or anything?
