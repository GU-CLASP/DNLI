B	oh
C	yeah it was in the papers and everything and you know you know people are amazed how big the moon was

C	I
B	yeah
C	so

C	and that's
B	I know with Taoism there's some some types of smoke I can't remember which ones but they're supposed to be cleansing er you know take out the impurities
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	I was supposed to have a stomach massage before the back one but erm erm I didn't want that in case of getting a funny tummy you know
B	yeah I don't really like stomach massages it's kind of
C	mm
[ANNOTATION]	stomach massage helps with digestion	Neutral
B	I dunno there's too many things there to prod isn't there?
C	well
B	like no I can't see what the good that does really massaging your stomach
C	mm

C	mm
B	on your back or legs or something
C	well I felt mm
B	yeah
C	and erm in fact I went down the
B	yeah
C	so did I I thought cos a er what I was scared of I was gonna get the the pancreatitis was gonna come back
B	oh yeah
C	and I didn't wanna get that back in the hospital especially since I don't have medical insurance any more
B	yeah
C	well
B	would you go to a Chinese hospital?

C	just this intravenous drip for five days sort of thing
B	mm
C	and then after that er you only sort of like stodge you could eat you know like porridge and

A	oh it's
B	come in here for a bit?
A	yeah
B	and I'll I'll go and calm her down

A	yeah yeah I've read about that see I meant to bring some Bonjela from the UK but I forgot
C	oh
A	it's fine we're fine so how is everybody how is
C	well erm she's still got this acute bronchitis
A	mm that's been a long while
C	I know well it's like it's acute you know it it's turning into chronic the know chronic is usually associated with smoking mm
A	it's just when it's is it when it's recurring quite a lot?
C	well yeah
A	when it
C	yeah it's it's just it she can't seem to get rid of it some and we've been giving her medicine and stuff but and that's
A	antibiotics or
C	no no we went to the hospital last week with her and erm the doctor said no that it's it's not what she needs so erm she had some erm cough syrup and er a couple of different types of pills and it seemed to get better a little bit better but it's worse at night
A	right
C	at bedtime
A	yeah
C	but er it's it's it's I mean it it's just constant coughing and coughing and coughing and
A	wow that's
C	I mean it's it's I mean poor thing you know
A	yeah
C	if if it's her suffering but it drives me round the twist as well you know
A	yeah yeah
C	this constant cough but cos it she forces it the
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about sick	Entailment
A	I think
C	a er you can't stop yourself she's doing it because she's got this thing in her
A	mm
C	up here she says on the top of her chest and she's trying to dislodge it
A	right
C	no but er apart from that she's happy enough
A	yeah
C	you know
C	and the well yeah yeah and she's developed this nervous twitch as well
A	that's habit that yeah
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about a film	Contradiction
C	mm see is everything alright at school? yeah yeah no problem so I don't know why she's doing this
A	the teachers say anything to her?
C	yeah yeah
A	mm
C	we had to give them presents for teachers' day
A	oh did you?
[ANNOTATION]	they are not sure about teachers day	Neutral
C	I said well why do you do this we don't have to he said well if you don't they don't treat
C	no
A	I got my first apple
C	so we ended up paying erm er got
A	twenty quid? really?
C	yeah
A	that's quite a big present
C	yeah and there was
A	cor my mum and dad only
C	there's four teachers
A	my mum and dad only give
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about school	Contradiction
C	I know yeah
A	mm
C	oh really?
A	yeah I've never had
C	oh what for the teacher?
A	an apple on the desk before
C	mm
A	no
[ANNOTATION]	they are not sure about teacher	Neutral
C	mind you they pay enough for the courses so
A	but also
C	it's like
A	cos the teachers they came at the beginning of term so you've got a new teacher
C	mm
A	so it's not like he's a
C	well she's back in er no she's back at the same school she was in before
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about party	Contradiction
A	right so she had that teacher before? cos
C	well but yeah but there are four different teachers so yeah
A	it's a bit weird to have a teachers' day at the beginning of term they should have it at the end of the year and then if er if you feel like you're you've had a good year with your teacher then you can do something if not don't
C	yeah
A	you know? it's a bit
C	yeah think it's up to the parents anyway it's got
A	yeah
C	don't think kids have got any say in it
A	what did you get?
A	no I've done one
C	you've done one
A	mm
C	so I'll just put your name down
A	mm yeah that's fine
C	mm right
A	are you very busy it's been really busy for us oh ah
C	er?
A	it's been quite busy
C	mm
A	we get the end of the day with her as well when she's tired
C	yeah
C	but I thought the idea was
A	yeah yeah we are so they're coming back but there's a lot of marking lately so
C	mm
A	do bits and bobs as well so bringing work home doing a bit of work at home I get distracted so easily I just wanna know what's going on in the other room
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	I certainly miss the money and you know the and the company with the and all the rest of but the the contact with the kids but I certainly don't miss the marking and and
A	yeah
C	having to get up at seven o'clock every morning
A	see I
C	mm
A	and doing bits but now
C	mm
A	and come in cos I've been coming home to spend some time with her and then doing bits in the evening
B	I picked her up
A	picked her up
B	and she had loads of wind
A	really?
B	so I think that's what might be why
A	you're much better at the wind than me
B	yeah
A	he is
B	it's what I eat
A	er? yeah you're better at getting rid of it
B	getting rid of the wind
A	so she should sleep now once she's asleep she's fine
B	yeah
A	but it's difficult to know whether she
B	yeah
A	she's got so many emotions lately that I think she might start crying to get cuddles
B	mm
A	extra cuddles you know?
B	that's the problem
A	did
C	what's that?
A	cry for attention
C	yeah
A	people either leave them to cry
C	I don't know
A	or they go in to them but
C	yeah
B	yeah well she's getting that age now I think where she's gonna start really playing with us a little bit
A	I don't know
B	anyway you need to go and do your work
A	I know
B	shouldn't be marking in the evening anyway of course
[ANNOTATION]	speaker A needs to cuddle the baby rather than doing their work	Contradiction
C	the marking
A	I know I've got to get organised to not do it in the evening
B	yeah
A	yeah I know
B	I like that idea
A	yeah
B	cos you're gonna drive yourself into the ground
A	I'm already tired
C	mm
A	yeah cos
B	it's cos you've been coming back to breast feed
A	come back every lunchtime
C	yeah?
A	I'm getting really fit
A	running back
[ANNOTATION]	running back to breast feed is causing A to gain more weight	Contradiction
C	well get yourself a bike
A	no I've borrowed
[ANNOTATION]	speaker A does not work so that she has more time to take care of the baby	Contradiction
C	you should do
C	ah oh well you ah you've got a bike
A	I need to pump it up but I'm still a bit scared to ride it aren't I? I was gonna practice riding round the park for a little while but I'm not very good on a bike you see

A	yes I know I know but I haven't got myself over to that street to the high street
C	it's not exactly far
A	it is
C	oh yes
[ANNOTATION]	speaker A has borrowed a bike	Entailment
C	it must take all oh nearly five minutes
A	but I don't have time because I go to class in the morning then I come back here at lunch then I go back to class and then it's four o'clock and they're then nanny finishes at four o'clock
C	you should get yourself a bicycle
A	I
A	oh oh yes I will do it next week
[ANNOTATION]	it takes around 1 hour to get to the high street	Contradiction
C	well I mean cos it wouldn't be as healthy if you got a e-bike but it would be quicker and they're not expensive
B	mm
A	mm
C	they're about two hundred quid so but you have to charge it and all the rest of it but er
A	mm
C	and er but now er I I cycle home which takes twenty minutes and you know I I take I cos I've got

C	it is
B	I hate it

C	yeah the other two were alright I still can't remember what the other film was the third one
B	mm
C	one you gave me was about the Wall Street walls oh connect to disconnect
B	no
C	erm so
B	okay so it's MP4 maybe that's why what programme are you using?
C	ah
B	I don't know I'm not sure if MP4 works on Windows Media Player
C	well that's probably the reason then
B	yeah I can test it on my one actually
C	well that's all pixelated but
B	have you got a VLC on your computers?
C	I don't even know what that means
B	okay I'll it'll take two seconds it's
C	there see? oh this is it freeze
B	yeah I don't think it can play MP4s
C	got to change again and change again
B	er
C	of course there's no sound
B	yeah erm I should be able to fix that
C	shouldn't there be sound coming from the computer?
B	er it depends
C	anyway you see what the problem is so you might as well stop it
B	mm yeah
C	okay
B	yeah see if I can get this programme on the stick I can put it on your computer
C	well I might as well take this off and delete this because I can't watch it
B	no leave it
C	yeah?
B	yeah I can put on a programme on your computer that will
C	oh
B	it'll work
