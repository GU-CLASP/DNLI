B	so what did you think of the equality vote?
A	erm I thought I don't really know the results
B	I think it's erm going to be a yes
A	oh erm I hope it's going to be yes cos all all my friends and stuff say it's yes say yes
B	do they?
A	yes
B	didn't you say that some people in your school wanted a no?
A	well yeah but they they seem like the unmature ones and they haven't really they're not very smart
B	do you think they're a bit homophobic?
A	I don't know just don't think they're clever enough to to know that just cos you're gay doesn't mean you're not an actual person it just means you're gay
B	were they? what were they against? people being gay or people having kids if they were gay?
A	people people being gay they just said just cos it's wrong they have no real valid point they just it's just eh their take on it erm I hope that when they get older they have a different view on it
B	yeah how many boys do you think are are like that?
A	out of my whole year?
B	mm hm
A	thirty
B	really? who are against it?
A	there's about fifty that are not against it
B	so thirty were against it that's quite a lot
A	mm hm
B	what would you have voted for?
A	I would have voted yes if I could have
B	yeah?
[ANNOTATION]	Most students are in favour of "yes".	Entailment
A	cos I think gays should have the same right to marry as anyone else
B	yeah
A	cos marrying can be a really good thing for someone
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Gay people have no right to get married.	Entailment
A	erm
B	and why would that be different than them just being boyfriend or girlfriend or?
A	erm I think because boyfriend or girlfriend is kind of easier to just break up I think with marry you really are sure that you're never going to break up and you really you just love each other that much that you'd want to spend the rest of your life with them
B	it's something to do with commitment then?
A	yeah
B	would you get married?
A	yeah
B	really?
A	yeah
B	yeah where would you get married?
A	I don't know a beach?
B	when do you think's a good age do you think to be married?
A	I don't know
[ANNOTATION]	Getting married at the age of 35 is a normal one.	Neutral
B	forty thirty?
A	yeah
B	and you have do you ever want to have kids?
[ANNOTATION]	People should make kids at an early age.	Entailment
A	sorry?
B	want to have kids?
A	probably cos well a lot of what I've heard from a lot of people is
B	yeah that's pretty cool isn't it?
A	yeah
B	well you're a pretty favourite part of my life
A	maybe
[ANNOTATION]	Most people love having children.	Neutral
A	erm I think
B	do you think they might need
A	I think stability would be a very a very big factor in it I think it'd be hard to marry if you didn't but I don't think iId let anything stopping marriage
B	I've
A	yeah
B	they're not
A	yeah but I don't think that should stop you from having kids cos if like
B	you've got to be able to afford to have them
A	yeah that's true
B	they need somewhere to live and enough food
A	yeah as long as you've got
B	yeah but do you
A	yeah but obviously so you can pay for them and house them
B	yeah
A	but
B	cos you've got to
A	yeah I know
B	it's not very fair
A	I know
B	how many
A	two that would be good preferably a girl and a boy
B	yeah what would you? what would you teach the boy and the girl do you think?
A	to be
B	would you have any rules?
A	yeah
B	what kind of rules would you have?
A	obviously like bedtime and stuff that you can't be going to bed at one o' clock in the morning and stuff
B	what other kinds of rules?
A	well feel like there's millions of rules but I don't think I could go through all of them
B	what about? what would you do if they were being mean to other people at school?
A	erm if they were being mean to someone else at school
B	how would you punish them?
A	I'd punish them for two days by
B	what if they just said rubbish and didn't ignored you
A	erm if they did that then
B	no
B	or does it feel like yesterday?

A	so you're saying you'll walk around in the shopping centre?

A	okay I'll go laser tag
A	I don't know how much laser tag is
B	mm

A	no
B	they'd be like oh my god got to keep on the good side of that one because like she's going to come down on us like a ton of bricks
A	you won't beat anyone
A	I know that's cos you hate guns you hate killing you hate everything to do with guns and killing and laser tag is guns and killing but without paintballs
B	well to be fair I don't think anybody dies
A	no nobody dies in paintballing either
B	yeah but maybe we better check on that

B	dumb as bricks?
A	bricks aren't smart

A	yeah but how do you know I won't get the same feeling you did?
B	I'm not doing the same as you did
A	yeah I didn't even mean it I didn't even know what I was doing so you might not
B	but putting on my voice and complaining that I was erm funny with you about the computer and just being really kind of
A	and you might not mean to be mean and like cos I might get the same feeling when all my friends are making fun of me it's not a good feeling maybe it's a good feeling for you maybe
A	it's not making fun of me it's just my friends are making fun of me cos of that
B	but I'm telling you I'm not saying it in front of you and your friends that's different I'm telling you here
