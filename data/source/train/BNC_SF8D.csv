A	is that to fit them bits in?
C	the hinges
A	the hinges in yeah
C	cos all the doors haven't got
B	yeah
C	holes in
A	no
C	for the hinges so
C	and I thought it can't be thirty-two
A	was it?
C	it's actually
B	right
C	thirty-five so there was twenty twenty doors in total
A	crikey
C	to do and I says you really could do with a bench drill
A	yeah
C	because we've got to pull it down and you've got to get the depth
A	you have yeah
C	you know and if you come through that face and everything I said so this was on Saturday and he went oh I'll ask I'll ask
A	yeah

A	yeah?
C	to see whether the er
A	yeah
C	fitted perfectly
A	does it?

A	yeah
B	yeah
C	so we got this piece of wood made a jig about of it and we used that to do all the holes well I did eight yesterday I burnt my cutter out

C	so I burnt the cutter out
A	what sort of wood is it you're
B	oh
C	it's oak
A	oak? well it'll be really
B	oh
A	hard stuff then that would
C	yeah but
A	because oak is oak gets harder as it get older don't it
C	you know it's not it I wouldn't say it's that you know it's relatively new oak
A	is it? yeah
C	but and as you're cutting on the
A	of course yeah
C	so it shouldn't really burn it
A	no
C	cos it's I mean it's going in
B	mm
C	so I mean it
B	oh
C	so I said oh I said well I'll see if I can find another cutter
A	yeah

A	what?
B	oh
A	did you buy it?
C	I bought it yeah cos it's it was a good one I bought the Screwfix I bought the the five in a set from Screwfix?
A	yeah yeah
C	which was something like
A	yeah
C	you can see why
A	yeah
C	so we've got er we've still got twelve doors to do
A	you're done
C	I put
A	wow that was a good
B	mm

B	yeah
C	yeah sort of the hardest one were the drawers
A	yeah?
C	there was no template for the drawers
A	weren't there? oh dear
C	and you have to put two
A	yeah
C	that with two holes and you have to fit it and it fit puts it in and drops down
A	that's it yeah
C	no
A	yeah

A	you've gotta suck with that little thing all round the edges cos that's
B	and then
A	where they get
B	there's furniture in the way and they get behind there don't they?
A	they get behind the furniture you can't
C	yeah
A	you can't be moving the great whole wardrobes and
B	do you
A	beds and stuff
B	have you got carpet moths?
C	no
B	no
C	cos I cos I vacuum
B	yeah you're good aren't you
C	I could do I could that was one of the things when I was saying about earlier about saying about doing the house the first thing I'd have done if I knew that I could be
A	yeah
C	carpet in my bedroom is just like every time I go and vacuum it I'm pulling more the carpet is still there but I'm pulling the
B	right
A	yeah
C	the underlay through it
A	are you? oh
B	oh really? oh
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	it'll just it it'll just disintegrate and you can see it
B	yeah
C	that's the first that's the first one that I would do
A	yeah
C	and then I'd
B	it's such a big job isn't it though to have carpets laid?
C	no
B	you've gotta clear out the whole room
C	yeah it's not a big job
A	well it is here
C	depends on it depends on what you've got in your room doesn't it?
A	we've got too much in our bedroom
C	cos
B	yeah
A	great old wardrobe which we have to take to pieces to get through the door
C	mm
A	mm?
C	I don't have that problem cos they're
A	no
C	fitted
B	they're all fitted
A	you got fitted wardrobes yeah

B	two bit chests of drawers
A	two great bit chests of drawers and
B	I like our bedroom
A	and your dressing table thing
B	mm
A	and er
B	the big wardrobe
A	the wardrobe and the bed
B	mm
A	and to get them out
C	yeah
B	mm
C	well you could always I mean you can just empty the wardrobe and it's always a good one to leave if you're putting the carpet down is to manoeuvre it
A	could do
C	if you're using if you're not using stretchers or whatever
A	well I'm not I'm not laying it
B	we're not gonna fit them no so they want they want a clear room don't they?
A	they'll want a clear room
C	yeah cos it's only like a half hour job to in a clear room
A	yeah
B	we we've done
C	yeah
B	carpets before and not made a good job of it
A	no
C	oh right
A	then then you've gotta knee bash it
B	yeah
A	stretch
C	yeah yeah yeah bolster chisel
C	no but that's what they use
A	what this these these things have got these little needles in and things
C	yeah
A	and then they
B	mm
A	and they grip the carpet and they push it in
B	mm
A	over the top of the then the the the spline that goes all around the side with the with the nails in it
C	easy
A	that not easy
C	well it used to be easy let's put it that way
B	yeah
A	well I ain't gonna do it
C	I don't know whether I could do it now but it used to be easy
B	mm
C	used to be easy
B	so are we thinking about carpets or are we
A	I think we'll just let it
A	no
B	as far as we know
A	well it's right in the doorways
C	yeah it's chucking it down the
B	oh
C	it
B	those hailstorms
C	it was chucking it down

A	god they were big as marbles
B	very dramatic
A	they were
B	weren't it?
C	yeah
B	mm
A	we thought they were gonna come through our roof didn't we? and I'm just that's what I was gonna say when you and
B	well yeah
C	it's thin isn't it?
A	yeah
B	wouldn't be good would it?
A	and very brittle and I think
B	mm
A	that's how most of these greenhouses get smashed up
B	possibly yeah
A	yeah
C	well it deteriorates doesn't it?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	mm
A	greenhouse back at
B	yeah
A	you know the wind
C	mm
A	must have
B	mm
A	what happened that must have been so bad that it made the pressure inside the greenhouse less than the pressure outside and that just went
A	and just finished up as a heap of
B	all very neat
A	yeah didn't didn't splatter all over the place
A	yeah
B	mm
C	there's a tree
A	no
B	no
A	down

C	well it was
B	yeah

C	didn't take that long
A	well it's over four hours
B	yeah
C	er ten o'clock one o'clock you know?
A	how fast do you go?
B	probably not a place we'd choose to for again we did not like Bournemouth at all
C	Bournemouth is a strange place I ain't been to
A	yeah that's all you wanna do
C	but it's really
B	yeah we weren't very impressed with that
C	it's very from what I know it's very stag nights and hen nights and old people I think
A	yeah there's a lot of old people there
B	yeah
A	but er but the actual
B	no I know but but it was kind
A	but the actual place was er like a
B	well
A	er
B	kind of
A	like a Great Yarmouth
B	grubby almost?

B	yeah
A	you know we'd go again but there are places where we've been and we'd never go again

B	well it was just er
A	there's nothing
B	quite ordinary apart from the horses which are lovely
C	I was
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	cos I was expecting something a little bit more
A	well
B	mm
A	to be honest with you I've been there yonks ago and I and I thought then where's the forest?
B	similar really
A	where's the forest?
C	it's like going it's like going to

B	write
A	angry we were
B	when we got back
C	yeah
B	but we didn't
A	and you know for all all the bumf and the hype that's that they've done for Chesil beach you would have thought that was a really good area to be
B	mm

C	no
B	yeah
C	oh I don't
A	well we got we got er your cousin that live in Dorset don't she?

B	yeah
A	they have this huge
B	yeah
A	and that's quite nice that was nice there weren't it?
B	yes it was
C	it's like it's like erm where Stonehenge is
A	well years ago when I was seventeen I went to
C	yeah
A	with nobody going oh get out of the way and all that now it's all fenced off isn't it?
C	yeah
A	you can't get to the stones any more
C	no
A	not without having a guide to take you around and we walked round there me and three other boys we were on we were on holiday camping holiday and we walked round Stonehenge and touched the stones and
B	mm
A	cos the stones don't just stand there they go down as well
C	yeah they go down a
A	yeah
B	amazing isn't it?
C	but they have moved them a couple of times to see what's underneath them
A	yeah they have yeah they're they're doing a dig there now at the moment they're digging
B	oh right
A	this er big they just found a graveyard haven't they just outside Stonehenge
B	yeah
C	they're doing a cos they're doing a new visitor centre there aren't they?
A	mm yeah
C	attraction to it
A	yeah
B	mm
A	and they just found this graveyard and they've been digging up er women with babies and
C	ritual
A	ritual site where they've been actually
B	mm
A	slaughtered they're saying one one of them had his head caved in
B	mm
A	so that's very interesting they're still digging
B	that's quite a way from the stones though isn't it?
A	it is a way from
C	mm
A	the stones but it's all part and parcel of the henge you're you've got Stonehenge and you've got other henges all the way round with
B	with burial mounds or
A	with burial mounds and
B	mm mm
A	still little henges I mean
C	yeah
A	we got we got er out out on the
B	cos they started
A	cos they started to rot away
B	deteriorating
A	they've been there for thousands of years
C	keep them wet they needed to get the water over them all the time
A	yeah
C	mm
A	and it's gotta be sea water
C	yeah
A	so anyway they've put it back in now stupid waste of time that was weren't it?
B	mm
C	yeah it's it's
A	all that money
C	keeps people's jobs keeps people in jobs
A	yeah well lots of them
B	yeah
A	are actual er volunteers and they're the ones that are keeping these other people in jobs
B	mm
A	these people with their clipboards are saying oh now go and if you go and dig there you could you dig there and what have you they're getting the money for it and these volunteers are going and doing it all for nothing
C	work
A	you know the work
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	which is where
B	volunteers on the railways aren't there?
A	yeah
B	the on the railways
A	railway volunteers you got all them volunteers
B	mm
A	that do the
C	yeah like the National Trust the English Heritage and
A	yeah
B	mm
A	in fact if you join er English Heritage it's about seventy-five quid a year
C	National Trust
A	National Trust is it? yeah
C	English Heritage is cheaper
A	is it? we used to be in English Heritage didn't we?
B	yeah yeah
C	they wrote to me a couple of they wrote to me last month saying cos like
A	did they? yeah
C	no point
A	there is no point no
C	don't go
B	mm
A	no
B	we don't go to National
A	I mean for for how many times you go to these National Trusts and English Heritage sites
B	we've
A	and
B	never ever made it pay have we?
A	no we never made it pay
C	oh I've made it pay
A	have you?
C	yeah
B	yeah yeah
C	see I see I go to
A	yeah
C	two
B	mm
C	or three times a year
A	yeah
B	oh right
C	you know
B	mm
C	I mean last year I went to
A	did you?
B	yeah
A	yeah but once you've been there you've been there
C	it changes the gardens change
A	yeah I think
C	walking around
A	so yeah
B	yeah
C	you can go and walk you can walk round the
B	mm
C	the estate
B	yeah
C	the garden's changed they have different things on erm
C	yeah
C	there's three
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	in the just in this area
A	yeah
B	mm
C	and they're around about fifteen pound a time to go in something like that
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	and there's forty-five pound
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	and then if you and then I did Wimpole this year
A	yeah?
C	which was another that was twenty-one pound that one
B	right
C	if you do the whole
B	mm
A	yeah
C	you get free park up yeah
B	mm
C	so
A	well I suppose it's
B	yeah
A	worth it in in if if you're that way inclined
C	English Heritage ones?
B	yeah the
A	National Trust
C	I mean
B	it's not even English Heritage is it it's something else isn't it?
C	no the in Yorkshire
A	it's the National Parks
B	what about Aysgarth? that's
C	Aysgarth?
B	that is
A	that isn't
B	it's one I remember
A	yeah yeah
B	it's not
A	you have to pay for that they don't accept English Heritage
B	no
A	or anything like that
C	there's that there there is the Bolton there's Bolton Abbey Bolton Castle
A	Bolton Abbey Bolton Castle yeah
B	and Bolton Abbey which don't belong to the National Trust or English Heritage so they're separate
A	yeah
B	so you have to pay for them differently
A	you do
B	but you've got
A	we found most of the stuff in
B	yeah
A	have to pay for it didn't you?
C	the stuff in well I
B	mm
C	English
A	yeah
C	but Pickering
A	yeah
C	so I could do those
A	yeah
C	Helmsley Castle is English Heritage
A	oh
C	so I got my money out up there
A	yeah
C	cos you don't pay for children with that one
A	oh I see yeah
C	if you're if you have membership
B	mm
C	you get children membership
A	yeah
C	with it
B	yeah
A	that's a family membership yeah
C	a family membership which is cheaper than
B	that's what we did thinking we could take take anyone then
A	yeah
C	which is
B	take the little ones as well
C	than the National Trust
A	yeah
B	mm
A	like that that seems such a shame that you have National Trust and English Heritage two different
B	yeah
A	charities they could they could amalgamate
C	well if you look at all the English Heritage stuff
B	it's different I know
C	totally different
A	I know it's different yeah but it seems so strange
C	it's like ruins
A	mm?
C	it's like ruins and a lot of the
A	yeah
C	English Heritage ones are free to go in
B	yes they are
A	yeah
B	mm
C	so like at
A	is there?
B	oh
A	yeah it's even down at the
B	yeah we went
A	oh
B	English Heritage ones to
A	we did yeah
B	to use it up or try to use it up
A	yeah
C	see
B	the money
C	see a good one having
A	yeah
C	English Heritage isn't it?
A	yeah
B	yeah yeah there's another one
C	it's
B	down there
C	erm see
A	is it?

C	or whatever
B	yeah
C	so
A	but we were gonna have a go and then we we chickened out didn't we?

C	no I know they're looking at moving them
A	are they? oh
B	mm
C	yeah
A	do you?
C	yeah I employed him as a cub supervisor
A	did you?
C	at er at
A	yeah?
C	and er I often
A	yeah?
C	and there was a big tour the other morning on a Wednesday morning
A	oh
C	and I went
A	yeah?
C	the academy
A	oh right
C	and oh right I says is that because erm
A	oh right
C	whose job I'm covering for at the moment
A	oh
C	and he went partly partly cos he built that link
A	yeah
C	with it I said oh right and he says just certain things I don't know he says we're also
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	mm
C	yeah and where are you thinking about taking them? he says well we're thinking about taking them to
A	oh right
C	or
A	yeah?
C	he said because they got boarding facilities
B	oh right
A	oh
C	because what all the academy players have to be boarding with
A	yeah
C	people
A	oh I see yeah
C	so if they put them in a boarding school or a
A	yeah
C	it's cheaper
A	well it must be mustn't it?
B	mm
A	well we knew we knew a person who used to board students didn't she?
B	yeah
A	and she used to feed them on stew
A	every day of the week stew and
B	mm
A	and that was all the leftovers went into this pot of stew didn't it?
B	that was
C	that sounds good
A	oh that was awful
C	that sounds brilliant
A	and she got paid and a lot of money er to board these students
B	mm
A	it was a crazy house weren't it?
B	it was a crazy house
A	they were lovely though weren't they? they were
B	oh yes they were
A	they were lovely people
B	very friendly and nice
A	they do now
B	as well no they must have done then
A	well I don't know
B	must have done mm
C	yeah they all get checked out don't they so
A	yeah
C	isn't it?
A	well they used to inspect us when we were child minding anyway didn't they?
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	yeah but
B	that's
C	there's people are different aren't they?
A	yeah
B	children you know
A	yeah
C	you you know you wouldn't you wouldn't
B	mm
C	just put that up for the inspectors cos they can come back at any time
A	they can yeah
B	mm
A	yeah
C	mm
A	mm
B	mm
A	so what's your criteria for the
C	what next when we go back?
A	yeah
C	erm
A	yeah oh
C	for the jobs
B	mm
C	and then after the thirteenth decisions will be made then you've got to apply for a position
A	you got you gotta reapply?
C	yeah
A	what's the idea of
C	show show show an
A	well what's what's the idea of that?
C	cos they've gotta make some people redundant
A	oh god there'll soon be no teachers they're advertising for teachers or on the television and and making people redundant as well
C	yeah
A	but er the people they the new teachers coming along will
C	well it says between twenty and twenty-seven thousand
A	is it?
C	but you get a
A	oh I see
C	but there's there's er I mean the it's I dunno what they're doing really I mean our place she's decided that she doesn't want any instructors
A	oh what have they all gotta go?
C	so no instructors so they'll all be proper teachers
A	oh I see right
B	mm
A	so does that mean they have to go in for
C	well and instructors have to you have to have your teacher qualification
A	yeah
C	so
A	right
C	which is what some of them started off as
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	but because they couldn't get staff
A	teachers' pay
C	er rather than cover supervisors' pay
A	oh right
C	mm yeah probably
A	mm
C	yeah
B	so what do instructors do?
C	the same as teachers
[ANNOTATION]	Person C had forgotten about the social security	Contradiction
B	oh
C	but you can
B	right
A	mm yeah
C	there were two pay scales
B	yeah
A	mm
C	yeah
B	but they're not qualified so
C	no
A	no
[ANNOTATION]	Person A think they are qualified	Entailment
B	mm
C	so but it's one way of cutting your
A	yeah it does yeah
B	yeah
C	but ATL the big union that don't strike or anything like that loads come out today er from their conference absolutely loads come out
A	yeah?
C	something like sixty percent of teachers in the first year quit
A	do they?
C	of all new recruits quit
B	mm
A	crikey
C	erm
[ANNOTATION]	Person C is thinking of the quit thing that they did	Neutral
B	yeah got to
C	cover supervisor is supposed to be there for a day's absence of two days' absence
[ANNOTATION]	Person C think if someone want to be supervisor he should be there	Entailment
A	yeah that's right yeah
C	not for
A	a
C	or
A	no
C	maternity covers or things like that
B	mm
C	see what happens so there's a there's a fair bit happening in in education at the moment there's a fair bit happening in
A	is there?
C	with the old
[ANNOTATION]	Person C had forgotten about the social security	Contradiction
A	oh god what's she up to now?
C	well two weeks ago two weeks ago her principal over at
A	oh right
B	alright?
A	oh
C	left
[ANNOTATION]	Person C had forgotten about the social security	Contradiction
A	has she?
C	not necessarily
A	no?
C	because she would have been on a quite a good salary to be executive principal
A	yeah
C	at two academies
A	yeah
C	to just going to be principal at one academy
A	yeah
C	so she's jumped ship and there has to be reasons why
A	there's got to be reasons haven't they?
C	right and the acting head
A	wow
C	so they put this acting principal in there because that's part of
A	oh right
C	and he left yesterday
A	did he?
C	no he left last week for a job in
A	oh
C	and he jumped ship
