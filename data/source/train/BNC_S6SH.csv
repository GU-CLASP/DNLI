B	yes that's when you're saving up for
A	yeah that's what that's pretty much all I use it for

B	I'm sure young
A	oh there's some photos on here I haven't seen those

A	yes yes cos I got to work out what to take to erm
B	oh you've got a picnic booked somewhere?
A	yes there's a village picnic but something like salad is always good cos you can do it quickly
B	do do you do you help
A	well they haven't asked but I always think that's quite nice to take something to share
B	just for yourself
A	yes
B	yeah
A	and it can be something easy like a salad doesn't
B	yes
A	need to be complex
B	yes
A	yeah
B	you can just take a few sprouts out of the garden

B	yeah I suppose
A	that's a shame
A	yes but they there's some nice recipes there
B	course baby sprouts you're supposed to let them stay
A	quite a long time aren't you?
B	quite a long time aren't they? well I suppose to get the best
A	yes yes they take a while
[ANNOTATION]	The recipe with baby sprouts will take a very short amount of time to prepare	Contradiction
B	that's right the best flavour when they've been in there a bit in the winter time they say
A	yes
B	we used to grow sprouts here years ago
A	oh right yeah that's good so I was going to have a look at the photos on here wasn't it?

A	it looks easy yes and I've got a blender so erm cos I don't like it when it's full of bits do you?
B	oh no we've got a blender here somewhere haven't we?
A	I expect you have yes no I bought one for my birthday mum got me one
B	oh that's pretty good
A	but it's useful for soups
B	oh yes cos the homemade soups are very good aren't they I think?
A	yes and then I'll probably make something like a potato salad that's easy
B	oh that's nice nice little
A	yes the new potatoes are in the shops at the moment

A	it's early I don't know why but erm they are in mm
B	oh nothing like a new potato is there?

B	but he says the other one is the better food to have in the
A	oh no I don't know that one no is that more modern is it or something?
B	well no it's the other way round actually we you know climb up some rickety old stairs
A	oh it's more
B	er but it's er I've taken
A	ah
B	in
A	ah right
B	what's it called now?
A	no that's okay I'm sure I can find it

B	oh
A	oh it's in Bahrain
B	oh Bahrain
A	the VIP tower at Bahrain
B	oh yes oh yes
A	that must be a Formula One
B	oh that's I
A	ah
B	remember seeing those cars go racing around the track
A	yeah
B	zooming out into
A	no I never went actually
B	oh no it's nice sort of island
A	yeah
B	and it's much more
A	mm
B	it's not like an
A	no it's more western there isn't it?
B	it's it's it's in Bahrain yeah
A	yes
B	I think the American navy shelters some of their boats down there
A	yes
A	there's a lot of unrest still isn't there in Bahrain?
B	yeah
A	arson and things
B	yeah that's right we've been there when there was er
A	yes
B	it was not riots but er this place of being rather angry about bits and pieces they used to hang out a lot of flags on certain days in Bahrain
A	yes
B	the locals
A	yes
B	oh well
A	how odd?
A	yeah
B	yeah no they're very severe on some of their sentences there they don't just give them two or three days
A	no must've been on drugs or something mustn't he?
B	yeah probably yeah
A	nobody bites someone's hand it's really bizarre
A	yes
B	mm I hope he perhaps he spit the finger out again after he had been biting it get it sewn on again
A	yes dear
B	I've seen that somewhere someone lost his finger or something and they whisked him off to hospital and they sewed it back on again and it worked
A	oh right cor well you had an accident once didn't you? and they had to
B	oh yes
A	with your thumb
B	oh no no I was
A	you had to have erm
B	no that was through they cut a bone through there somewhere
A	yes but there was something with your thumb too wasn't there? later with a gun or something that you trapped erm
B	right
A	you clipped the end they had to
B	oh that's right
A	to sew erm sew it back on well yes you had to go and find it
B	that's right
A	and they did
A	they did rescue it
B	good good job
A	but they did a good job didn't they?
B	oh it had
A	you can't tell can you?
B	it's just a bit flat at that end now but you wouldn't know at all now
A	ah yes but you can't tell at all no you can probably tell but no one else could
B	I mean for years you could always see the colour that little pinky
A	ah yes
B	and now you can't
A	no you can't at all
B	no no
A	it's interesting isn't it? the body can take a long time to heal completely
A	but it does
B	and they no you can't you don't know anything wrong with that one now
A	oh no you can't tell at all
B	it's a little bit flatter that's all yes
A	yes no you wouldn't know
B	I've forgotten about that just
A	yes
B	just the gun clicked back on me or something
A	yes
B	er so that's
A	gun guns are dangerous
B	so don't play don't play with guns no
A	don't play with guns no that's right
B	no that's right
A	good idea
B	you used to have to carry them at one time though
A	I expect you did yes
B	er
A	what you did?
B	yeah they were
A	oh right
B	they always thought that some someday or other the Germans would come down and try to blow up all the aeroplanes
A	pinch them yes oh right
B	so you had all these things
A	no
B	no no yeah
A	but I expect you had training you all did didn't you?
B	oh yeah oh you all had training
A	yes
B	yes
A	no I've tried a few times
B	my my father was an excellent shot
A	oh was he?
B	yeah long ago
A	oh right was he a hunter?
A	oh I see oh right yes
B	and and he he was a good
A	oh right oh that's good
B	you know they used to have these shooting ranges on fairgrounds years ago
A	yes
B	don't suppose they do now
A	no I suppose not
B	but he I remember he took us to one some fair somewhere
A	yes
B	and he just picked up a rifle bing but it took first shot to see where it went
A	mm
B	cos he used to say they used to nick some of the things you know er you know
A	mm yes I bet they did yes
B	so he got it all worked out and he always came home with the prize
A	oh that's good
B	yeah that's right
A	yeah he was clever
B	yeah they wanted
A	bet they didn't like him did they at the fairgrounds?
B	no no no
A	yes
B	I think he I think he got a teddy bear once for one of the children
A	oh that's nice
B	and he had a choice he could take like
A	yeah
B	yeah he was a good shot there actually yes
A	yeah that's good
B	what were we visiting once er?
A	yes it's quite a long time
B	yeah I mean
A	mm
B	I think he was a volunteer like you know?
A	ah right
B	one of those volunteers cos in those days no one
A	no
B	until you got into it
A	no that's right there hadn't been anything like that had there?
B	not like that no
A	no
B	not like that no
A	I mean there had been wars but they were
B	but they no
A	a long way away weren't they? in those you know like South Africa or something
B	yes
A	yes yes and those people you were up against
B	yeah that's right
A	didn't have much there might've been a lot of them though I suppose it would've been scary from that point of view though you could
B	yeah
A	you could be outnumbered couldn't you in
B	yeah yeah no
A	like the Boer War and things?
B	yeah my father never had any love for the French for fighting
A	no
B	he used to say they used to run away when the going got tough and vanish into the wilderness somewhere
A	oh dear
B	yeah
A	it's not what you need
B	no he he liked all the Indian people fighters
A	yes they were known for being good weren't they?
B	yeah he said they were always
A	yeah
B	they fought to the last he would say like they would
A	yes
B	go out there
A	yes
B	that was the old saying that live to fight another day
A	yes
B	but er yes
A	yes did you get to go home much in the war?
B	no
A	no not at all?
B	not much
A	you didn't get any leave to go home?
B	no cos
A	you were too far away
B	you were brought too far away you see
A	yes
B	cos no one you didn't fly those days you went by boat
A	yes that would've taken too long
B	so it would be weeks trying to come home then yeah
A	oh right so you were away the full four years then really
B	yeah a long a long way away yeah
A	yeah yes that's that's a long time
B	yeah that's right
A	and that's a long time to not come home at all isn't it?
B	yes you didn't no you don't get leave in those days you're too far away like
A	yes and did you get news from home?
A	not really?
B	yes it used to take about four to five weeks to get there
A	oh right so you'd get letters would you?
A	yes
B	but occasionally you moved on somewhere the
A	oh that was nice
B	yeah hopefully
A	yes yes that's good
B	I remember we used to have a big tray full of them
A	oh right
B	you you come down onto alphabetical you know
A	yes
B	so they haven't gotta plough about hundred and fifty letters to see if they've got it
A	no
B	no no
A	no that's good
B	they were well organised that sort of thing
A	yes that that was important wasn't it?
B	yes
A	did you get things like papers? from England?
B	only some we didn't get very much
A	no
B	when we got teamed up with the Americans somewhere I can't remember where it was now
A	yeah
B	they had everything even tubs of ice cream
A	they were yes they were well supplied weren't they?
B	oh they that compared with ours
A	they were popular how they get tubs of ice cream out there?
B	oh I don't know how they managed to get it but they got it
A	no
B	these big tubfuls used to arrive
A	oh right
B	yeah they always had their ice cream Americans and er I remember oh I went out with a few Americans that's in this country
A	mm
B	don't know what I was doing must've been on some exercises somewhere I suppose somewhere in Stratford upon Avon cos they loved to go to Stratford the Americans
A	oh right
B	cos of the Shakespearean stuff
A	history
B	yes
A	yes
A	ah yes yeah
B	and so yeah they're I remember meeting them up in er Stratford somewhere
A	I always think Americans appreciate history erm you know the old towns and cities more than us
B	well well yes of course I suppose America's pretty new really isn't it?
A	yes they seem to really appreciate it we're a bit nonchalant about it aren't we?
B	yeah
A	yeah well it's remarkable really isn't it? like that one
A	a pub since thirteen twenty
B	oh yes
A	yeah
B	well they love that sort of thing don't they the Americans?
A	yeah I think that's amazing
B	course the Americans don't anything in the eighteenth century or the nineteenth century they're that's er
A	yes
B	pretty old for them but here we go back to almost BC
A	yes
A	that's right
B	they like English pubs I remember
A	yes
B	cos I know we we were all air crew members but they they had about four times as much as we got in pay like
A	yes
B	and they always used to buy drinks first
B	yes
A	oh that was nice of them
B	yeah they're very nice Americans
A	yes mm
B	they're always very friendly towards us of course you know always er
A	yes that's right yes
B	we met er er did mum and I meet them?
A	oh right oh right did they?
B	they they they'd come on a tour from America like
A	yes
B	the fact we were British down there they seemed to love talking to us
A	oh that's nice
B	they liked talking to mum anyhow yes
A	yes that's lovely
B	yes
A	yeah I like America as well
B	you do?
A	I think it's got a lot to offer actually I think cos people say oh it's not got much history but it has actually it's got quite a lot of history
B	well
A	yes and it's quite culturally diverse like
B	yeah
A	New York is nothing like Louisiana
B	no no
A	it's a big country so I suppose that's not surprising is it?
B	it's enormous isn't it?
A	whenever you
B	yeah
A	ah right ah yes California
B	south of there we were south of there
A	that's very pretty that side
B	yeah I was down
B	that's right
A	it's actually very nice yes I like there
B	yeah
A	yeah I liked it there
B	yeah and I remember we were probably
A	yes I didn't like Los Angeles at all that was a horrible city
B	yes a big city yeah that's right
A	San Francisco's a nice city
B	yeah that's
A	got the bridge
B	probably the best one out there
A	Golden Gate Bridge
B	yeah I've seen that bridge yeah
A	and got yes vineyards on the other side and it's a
B	yeah yeah it's nice
A	it's a hilly city so it's and they've got trams and things so it's many ways seems more old-fashioned than than England
B	well cos it's cos it's a big country over there isn't it? so they have lots of
A	yes
B	yeah ice cream used to be their favourite
A	yes
B	I just remember
A	that's right yes they are big on that
B	yeah they like their ice cream the Americans big tubs full loads of the stuff
A	mm
B	when I was what I England of course in nineteen in in the nineteen
A	mm?
B	we were short of food of course in England
A	oh right oh
B	I used to send it home to mum er all boxes of it
A	oh right oh that's nice
B	yeah that's er somewhere oh I must've been in Egypt then where you could buy it
A	ah
B	and they they had a they had a good service to send it over to England the shops I mean
A	oh that's good
B	could get it in the shops in Cairo somewhere if you haven't been in Cairo
A	yeah I expect you were popular
A	yes
A	yeah that's what I mean
B	yes there was all this
A	yes they loved you
B	all this butter and marge and all the rest of it and jam and things all sort of
A	that's right jam and yes cos it was all rationed wasn't it here?
B	all that sort of it was it was all rationed yeah so
A	did you eat well during the war?
B	oh yes er we we were Air Force
A	you got good rations did you?
B	yeah we had good ones especially the air crew ones they were all very good
A	probably better than home didn't you?
B	yeah that's right they were
A	no you were very slim weren't you?
B	oh yes I was very lightweight
A	yes yes that's right so you didn't put on weight with that
B	no no
A	yeah I suppose they kept you fit though didn't they with all running around and things?
B	yes I was horrified when when we first joined up we used to have to I used to send them to London first of all when you got them
A	ah right
B	for for early training I think
A	yes
B	so all that was a question of disciplines
A	yes marching round
A	oh dear
B	you you did it to the number of steps you take
A	oh right like a thousand steps or something
B	yes
A	start again
B	not very happy with you
A	no
A	well it's important isn't it?
B	we we didn't haven't have that's that was a discipline really we didn't do any more after that
A	yes
B	only had about two or three weeks of that and that was the end of it
A	yes well that's probably sensible though
B	yes
A	can't have an army where everyone's doing their own thing
B	well no no no
A	be a bit of a mess wouldn't it?
B	yes
A	it might be a bit tedious but I suppose it's necessary
B	oh no
A	yes
B	what what what did we use to do there? oh yes we used to do erm
A	mm
B	oh we used to do
A	oh right
B	so in case you
A	yes
B	you're supposed to be able to get a
B	so oh yes
A	well yes it's probably quite a useful skill
B	it well yes useful though I suppose
A	yes
A	and did you know grandma before the war or not till afterwards?
B	that's a good question now did I know her before?
A	she must've been in the same town but that wouldn't mean you knew each other cos you would've gone to different schools
B	did I know grandma? think I did actually
A	ah right
B	I yes I think she wrote to me occasionally
A	oh right oh yes you were quite young when you met then
B	oh yeah then she yeah then she used to write to me
A	you were seventeen when you joined up
B	tell me all the local news like
A	oh that's nice
B	something like that yes I would
A	yes
B	erm some other guy used to write to me we went to Canada to live
A	but you weren't engaged?
B	no
A	no you were too young probably weren't you?
B	I should think so
A	you were seventeen when you joined up
B	yeah that's right
A	and then you know that is pretty young to be getting engaged
B	yeah
A	and grandma actually is a was a bit younger than you wasn't she?
B	she was a year just over about fourteen months younger yeah
A	yeah yeah so you wouldn't really be getting engaged at fifteen sixteen it's too young
B	no no no no I'm no no that's it
A	not with the war going on as well
A	it was a
B	no I
A	no
B	we saw more of each other when we got back home like
A	yeah yeah
A	yes
B	cos she used to write to me occasionally about once a month
A	oh that's nice
B	tell me all the local news
A	yes that must be a nice link with home
A	yes
B	er
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	I suppose that's natural
B	I suppose
A	yeah well they you'd know different things I suppose wouldn't you? as a daughter
B	yes oh yes that's right
A	yeah you would notice different things
B	conversation would be different I suppose yeah
A	exactly yeah it's always going to be a bit different
B	yeah I expect so yeah
A	yes oh I better get going soon but I'm gonna make one more cup of coffee
A	before I go would you like a cup of tea? I know you don't like coffee
B	yeah don't
B	yeah I used to box once you know?
A	oh right oh yes
B	as a as a youngster
A	oh that's good
B	and I I've forgotten where I was somewhere but well I don't know we I think we used to only we'd do three rounds you know we'd we'd
A	yes
B	but we as youngsters used to limit it to about three so you didn't kill
A	it's probably that's sensible yes
B	didn't kill each other on the way
A	yes it's a dangerous sport isn't it? even today it's very dangerous
B	well yes I cos I remember I mean I'd never done any boxing
A	yes
B	and by chance I was I was with some cadets somewhere forgotten where we were now and this chap came rushing at me like a bull
A	oh bull
B	so I shut my eyes and put my fist out and he went on the end of it
A	oh that was lucky
B	and he went boomph
A	ah well you looked good
B	and I met him years later
A	I bet he remembered
B	yeah it's I think he just made it up you know it was like that didn't want to get up again
A	no
B	or I might knock him down again so I thought that no no I wasn't a boxer anyhow but
A	that's right
B	and
A	oh right cos dad used to box too didn't he my dad?
B	yeah
A	yeah yes he was quite into that
B	oh I didn't know that my dad used to buy me a punch ball
A	no
A	yes yeah I do
B	you put them on your heads
A	oh yes
B	one of those
A	yes
B	except that it had about sort of twenty or thirty or forty er pieces of erm
A	oh right yes
B	yes er
A	elastic
B	elastic
A	yes
B	there was about twenty or thirty of those there
A	ah
B	you could hardly hit it before the bastard came back at you you can imagine how quickly you know that that moved hit you in the face
B	yeah so no that's
A	it's not good
B	yes
A	yes
B	yeah that's right but I remember they for some reason they chose me just er there was some area thing going on
A	mm
B	and I know hit me so many times in the on the chin with me and I managed to stay up all the three
A	oh dear oh really? oh dear
B	yeah it jarred it all
A	oh yes
B	but I don't know
A	it's very dangerous yes
B	so I gave up boxing after that thing yeah
A	oh yes it's probably good
A	yes cos there was a bad one about a week ago wasn't there?
B	oh no
A	Eubank Junior hit erm
B	oh yes
A	his opponent in the
B	no no no no yes
A	and they're not wearing helmets I can't understand why they can't wear those soft helmets
B	yeah they should do that
A	erm but they weren't and erm yes they
B	yes
A	and they put him in a medically induced coma for over a week er cos they say that's the safest thing cos moving
B	yes
A	you know it's no good if you got er blood on the brain and they've woken him up and he seems okay but his career's over the end he can't
B	oh
A	can't erm box ever again
B	oh he survived did he?
A	survived and he it seems he's not brain damaged
B	no no
A	erm cos they can be but he won't be allowed to box again that's it that's a big shock isn't it? from one day to the next and that's his career that guy
B	well oh yes
A	yeah so that's he's
B	yes
A	yes
B	wait until the thirties and get knocked out don't you?
A	yes
B	erm
A	no it's a dangerous sport yes so they're saying should they have more rules? I mean I can't understand why they can't wear those soft helmets though that seems odd
B	mm yeah
A	oh right
B	in days gone by
A	yeah
B	they might've held them in some little town or village nearby
A	ah
B	and they and they'd be in the open air the boxers in those days
A	yes
B	I remember him taking me in one of those
A	mm
B	so he must've thought I'm gonna be boxer then
A	yes
B	I didn't like the idea of doing boxing no
A	no no it's dangerous
B	I got I can remember I couldn't open my mouth for about a week put me off
A	yes that's no fun is it?
B	no no no no no no
B	but
A	yes he used to box yeah
B	did he yes
A	then he moved on later to judo I remember
B	yeah
A	yes that's a bit safer I think
B	yes these things are all on and on about you know twenty strands of elastic or whatever you know?
A	ah right
B	so the harder you hit them the harder they come quicker they come back don't they I suppose
A	yes
B	yeah
A	mm they say it's good with teenagers though boxing cos it gets rid of a lot of that aggression
B	oh I suppose that might do it
A	in a
B	it would do that yes
A	so erm yes I've seen
B	yes
A	they just need an outlet don't they?
B	plenty of outlets
A	and if you don't give them an outlet then they're gonna go and break things up anyway so better they have a
B	yes
A	controlled outlet and it's supervised
B	yes
A	and they get some training and it's competitive so yeah it's quite interesting
B	oh yes I remember the guy who I first saw like that erm he's I didn't know but I later learned he was a west of England champion
A	oh right
B	no wonder he gave me a hiding
A	yes
B	consider he was a much better chap than I was no no
B	yeah
A	oh good you gave it up
B	oh no I
A	no no that's no fun
B	I didn't volunteer any more to do a thing like that no no no
A	no not surprised
B	once was enough I met one guy that's right yes I met with one guy many
A	yes
B	when we had to fight each other for some reason one boxing match and I know when he came like and and I just went he came rushing and I just put my hand out like and he went on the end of it and down he went
A	oh right
B	I didn't hit him he just fell onto my fist like
A	oh right
B	yeah so
A	well that was good
B	yeah that's a good way of doing it
A	yes much better
B	yes
A	oh
B	course in those days we used to have er cadets before you ever got into the Royal Air Force you had trial you had sort of a
A	ah yes cadets were you in the cadets?
B	cadets yeah
A	yes
B	cadets yeah
A	cos you were too young
B	too young
A	yes yes
B	I was about seventeen I was about
A	yes
B	something like that
A	yes
B	yes we most towns had their local cadets
A	yeah well they still have cadets don't they? in all the towns now yes
B	do they have cadets? I don't know
A	the army's always been quite good at that keeping a reserve
B	oh the army
A	erm but they have yes they have cadets and they have Air Force cadets still too
B	oh do they? do they?
B	what in the Air Force was he?
A	yes in erm Wales
B	oh
A	they were quite good they did all sorts
B	oh yes yes a lot of exercises
A	it's a good way to get people interested I suppose isn't it?
B	yes well yeah
A	particularly if they're not from army families cos I mean it does tend to be
B	yes
A	well particularly the officers tends to be in the family doesn't it?
B	family yes yeah that's right
A	but the the regular soldiers they need that input from someone when they're still quite young to know if oh that's for me or that's not for me
B	yes yes yes
A	yeah I think that's good
B	erm yes I remember the
A	ah right
B	cos they eight of your pals all join up together like
A	oh that was nice
B	so you fought
A	yes
A	I suppose that was a good way to
B	good way to yes
A	get people to work together
B	well that's right most of them got killed together I think in the First World War I suppose
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yes
B	I
A	he did well didn't he?
B	did I tell you?
A	yeah you did that's amazing yes cos he was injured several times wasn't he?
B	did I tell you? oh that's right
A	mm
A	oh right
B	they wanted him to sort of
A	yes
B	and
A	he'd had enough I expect
B	always came to my dad for advice
A	oh right
B	and he was a colonel like in the army like
A	oh your dad
B	the no the the chappy who was one of his managers like
A	the chap in the factory
B	at the time of
A	oh right yes
B	he was a director I think he was the director of somewhere
A	yes
B	and he he went he'd been in the territorials before
A	yeah
B	but when the army when the war came he was in there like
A	oh right
B	he always took over my dad and had a chat what he what he should know and what he shouldn't know
A	ah yes ah
B	yes
A	well respected
B	er well he was yes I suppose
A	yes yes
B	what do we have erm? there's a book here once did I show you once? er
A	no
B	a cellophane book
A	oh right no I haven't seen that one
B	yes I did have a I've forgotten what happened to it now it was a big cellophane I think
A	yeah mm
B	I think he gets a mention in there for something
A	oh that's nice
B	for er something like that yeah
A	yeah
A	yes
B	and so my dad used to chat to him and tell him what to do and what not to do
A	oh
B	how to get on er try to get on yes
A	mm I'm gonna make that cup of coffee for me and tea for you
A	and then I'll better get on my way oh I've got a message

A	mm

A	it's good having neighbours like that makes a big difference
B	it is yes oh they're very good I remember the
A	mm
B	they day we arrived er not him well his brother lived there's a er group of cottages there about three really and
A	yeah yes
B	mother had the middle one
A	right
B	another brother had the one on this side and the other one had the brother he had the other side you know so they all lived together like
A	oh right
A	yeah that's often the way isn't it?
B	yeah yeah that's right
A	around here yes
B	except the one he was very clever with money he he did I think he was a mechanic somewhere with the
A	oh right
B	well he had his own business in the village there
A	oh that was good yes
B	I say he was always doing things and making things better
A	the others
B	he he used to go to their house
A	yes
B	one one but
A	yeah
B	and the other chap was a doer he had a little garage in the town
A	oh right
A	is it still there the garage or is it closed?
B	well
A	mm oh right
B	they sold it up and erm made a fortune that they built houses on
A	oh they did well didn't they?
B	yeah so he was yeah he did do well
A	yeah people who sold at the right time
B	yeah
A	because those village enterprises often went downhill afterwards but
B	yeah
A	those who
B	yeah he
A	they did brilliantly didn't they?
B	yeah I I think
A	yes she always goes to see them doesn't she?
B	yeah she does now comes and sees them yeah
A	yeah she says one of the houses is like stepping back in time
B	well that's right yeah that's right yeah well
A	yes
B	it is er and your grandma used to do what did she use to do now? she was too shy to speak to them up there
A	yes
B	and cos it's only cottages up there and they they looked at this house as the big house
A	yes
B	and and they used to
A	yeah
B	digging the bulbs up occasionally she'd never get up to talk to them just
A	yes
B	er she was a bit too shy to talk to them
A	yes
B	yeah
A	oh well yes grandma was quite shy wasn't shy wasn't she?
B	oh well she was shy very shy in those things greeting people
A	mm yeah
B	er oh yes and her mother was very
A	mm
B	cos when we got to know each other we we invited her mother
A	oh right
B	and then then she did actually yeah
A	oh that's nice
B	and so they er got on quite well
A	mm
B	and of course what did we do now?
A	oh did you?
A	oh mm
B	when her husband died
A	oh right oh that's nice
B	and she did a circuit she went down to er her other daughter
A	yes
B	and then erm to live and
A	that's nice isn't it?
B	two two months
A	yes
A	yes
B	I think she'd like to stay forever
A	that's the trouble I suppose that's the worry
B	yes well that well that was it actually
A	well I suppose that's why it's good to have the circuit arranged before you start that kind of arrangement and and then you can say oh no
B	yeah
A	you know
B	yeah yeah I
A	I'll drive you down there myself
B	in fact
A	yes
B	this is what happened with mum actually her father was wanted to come over
A	oh yes that's right
B	and he was a
A	yes
B	he said he'd look after all the gardens here for us
A	oh right
B	but mum said I don't want to
A	oh oh right yes
B	she was she she er she was
A	yes
B	so Victorian father was different from what they are today like
A	yeah yes that's right
B	yeah and they they were sort of in command I suppose
A	yes
B	in those days
A	and the trouble is even though she was a grown woman
B	yeah
A	it wouldn't feel like it was her own home probably
A	no
B	she well I mean she
A	yes
B	oh
A	oh that's nice
B	on on the on the road to see them occasionally
A	yes
B	yeah
A	mm
B	course she never
A	yes
B	but but she didn't like him no
B	for some reason yeah
A	I expect she was probably scared of him a bit wasn't she?
A	if he was quite Victorian
A	mm very strict probably
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yes
B	he was very severe like you know?
A	yes although people didn't smile in photos in those days did they?
B	no no no no no
A	they were told not to
B	not to smile no no that's right
A	yes
B	very very severe I suppose
A	yeah so you don't know how accurate the photo is cos people were told not to smile
B	no no no that's right no no
A	it was different yeah
B	they don't have a
A	that's right yes
B	yeah
A	probably
