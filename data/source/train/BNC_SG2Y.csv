C	yeah did we get there in the end?
D	don't like to give up do you
C	I
E	you must know him he started the Solidarność movement in er in
A	the what movement?
E	it's called Solidarity but he
F	yeah
E	er then he became an MP
C	wow look at that cheeky chappy
E	do you do you want
A	no I don't
E	look at the younger ones when he had a
A	does he appear anywhere on the you know there's all those famous pictures of erm people like kissing and stuff like that on the Berlin wall like painted is he one of them?
E	yes yes he is yes he is
B	was it Brezhnev who went around kissing everyone
D	there's a couple isn't there? where there's like two men kissing each other and there's a few other ones
B	yeah Helmut Kohl and a few other
E	yeah they say it did
B	there's Helmut Kohl so it was Brezhnev won't it?
F	Brezhnev as the was the leader of it but there are he he is on the Berlin wall
B	no but he was the Russian I mean who went round kissing the other leaders on the mouth and they and and they didn't want to offend him so they they'd have to like let him
E	I don't remember that I don't remember that
F	yeah I don't remember that
B	and he was going round the world kissing all the
F	that would be that would Yeltsin that's the sort of daft sort of thing he would do
E	was the drunk one
B	but he came in after the fall didn't he? he was like ninety mid nineties but anyway whoever it was use to go around kissing all the world leaders and er Fidel Castro who was not into that type of thing didn't refused refused to see him if he was going to kiss him but
A	they're big mates as well
F	cool
B	are they going to handshake are they going to kiss whatever and apparently Brezhnev only got on the plane if he was told that Castro would be there to receive him and kiss him publically so Castro had to turn up so he turned up and had the the cigar in his mouth all the time so he could never kiss him
E	yeah
B	didn't take it out his mouth
E	no it it led you'd say directly you know it progressed didn't it? to the to the fall of the Berlin wall
F	mm
E	they and then everyone all the labour party leaders wore a Solidarity Solidarność badge with erm like a
D	the
E	alright the
A	it's like a fish isn't it?
C	I bet he's in there
A	er Jimmy Savile is in there
C	oh
A	do you reckon they'd had to do some kind of weird
D	well he's not on Top of the Pops two any more is he?
A	yeah like don't like do they have to do to kind of bring things back in or do you reckon Articulate even realises it's in there
E	no they have to do new Articulates
C	well like Hitler might be in they've got chairman Mao in there so why not? why not another horrible man
A	yeah well he had a little a bit more time
E	I bet you can't name three entertainers from that era who have not been indicted under operation
D	Edmonds
B	squeaky clean
E	Edmonds hasn't
B	Tarrant
A	Tarrant
C	Keith Chegwin
E	okay I would say he was a bit later but yeah you're right he hasn't been
A	oh okay
D	did you David Hamilton?
E	yeah true he hasn't
A	Peter Purves
C	and with a name like that
D	Andy Peters
C	I was going to say Andy Peters but he's too late
D	no they're later they're later
C	yeah yeah
D	Edmonds is
B	surprisingly Rod Hall
A	he's dead anyway isn't he?
B	yeah
A	so they're not going to find out anything
C	Paul Daniels
B	RIP you hate Paul Daniels don't you?
E	he wasn't a very nice guy but not
A	I always thought he was alright until we watched him on that Louis Theroux and he was a bit of a
B	creepy dwarf like tory
A	yeah
E	no they they've taken that Theroux Jimmy Savile one-off
C	have they?
F	you won't find that
D	but they did two
B	you can get it on the internet
D	they did to two didn't they?
E	no you won't find it on the internet
B	me and
A	not since I don't think we watched it post
B	no maybe it wasn't he was dodgy though wasn't he?
E	the one where he was er going into his mother's bedroom
F	and all her clothes are still there hanging up in the wardrobe
A	oh god like that must have
B	I don't think that was a surprise many people knew he had gone on about his mum all the time
A	but didn't they say? wasn't it a bit of an open secret about him at a certain extent that people seemed to be turning a blind eye but obviously nobody
E	yeah well no the worst thing that the BBC ever did with him I think was that they the Panorama I think it was Panorama rather than ITV
A	yeah it was Panorama
E	had done an hour long expose of him essentially that said everything that he did and erm had made it completed it it was you know in the can and it was ready to go er but it was very close to erm the anniversary some kind of anniversary of Jimmy Savile fifty years in show business or something like that and they'd planned a series of events er you know running over a week to to you know? to to commemorate that fact and there was erm a scheduling meeting and of course the people who made the programmes of celebrating his life were in a different department they were in entertainment and the other people who had done it were news
A	right
E	and so they had it they and when they do these planning meetings you know to to show what time are we going to show it they showed it they showed the programme to the rest of the executives
A	blimey
E	you know that's that's the worst thing that they ever did cos they couldn't say they didn't know they all sat there and watched it yeah that was awful
C	Terry Wogan
B	I like him good egg
E	fair point fair point
B	Wogan's
E	okay you've only you've only said two really you've only said Wogan and Edmonds
F	good night see you all in the morning
C	good night
B	night night
E	someone who is like a children's TV thing
D	oh who's er Tony Hart?
B	RIP
A	yeah nothing came it's probably easier to work out who well no not who they have got
F	I mean again sitting down and doing a list of who they have got it's frightening
A	it's been a bit but there's been a few where they've interviewed them and nothing has come of it and that's been a bit unfair
E	who was the one recently with that
B	Dave Lee Travis
F	Tyrol Blackman
B	well not that
A	I really think they should not tell people until like take them in that's fine but only let people know when it's
E	yeah I mean you look at you look at Cliff Richard that was awful
B	Cliff Richard?
E	yes
B	he's guilty as sin Cliff Richard that's that's the day before it came the day before it came out he moved to a country with no extradition treaty
D	no who who was
A	and that thing in Bristol
D	yeah yeah that was before no who who is the guy who er who did the
E	is that right?
B	and he can never be
D	Matthew Kelly
A	yeah
B	I think it was Barbados
D	they ruined they ruined him didn't they? and he said he was
A	yeah
B	Cliff Richard is as guilty as sin dad I'm telling you
D	exonerated and nothing
E	but whether or not Cliff Richard is guilty
B	he got away with it he didn't ever go for questioning cos he he fled the country
A	that's the thing you just shouldn't surely like for the thirty-six hours that they're investigating you just don't need to know
B	Cliff Richard honestly was
E	but no the point is the principle that
A	they had helicopters with Sky thing
B	that's the press that's the press that's not the police
E	helicopters with Sky things no no but it was it was the press yes
B	they asked they asked
E	the police invited the press
B	no they asked
E	to film the
B	the asked for him to come in for questioning related to paedophilia and he fled the country moved became a citizen of a country with no extradition treaty
E	okay I didn't know that
B	if the police want you for questing and you don't go in and you flee the country
A	that's very suspicious
B	and he there are so many stories about him and he was so tight with all the establishment he is he is guilty as sin
E	but before that happened the the point of them filming the the erm what's it called where they go to your home you know the
C	through the keyhole
C	Loyd Grossman he's not been done has he?
A	they do a thing where they the police release a thing that says like a fifty-three-year-old man has been arrested in in further thingy of operation
B	public record though isn't it? you have to
A	really? just think like that whole thing with that poor guy in Bristol was just so awful
F	he have you read his book?
A	no
E	it's very good no it is good it is good
A	was just so awful
E	because he's not you you know he wasn't
D	you knew him right? the guy in
C	which guy?
E	he wasn't you know there wasn't one fact about him that he could be construed as guilty other than the fact that he was a
A	yeah
E	fairly quiet nice gentle guy with funny hair but that was it there was no other there was nothing in his past there was nothing remotely odd other than how he looked and that's you know you know had he been black or or something or something else more visible cos he was arrested simply for how he looked and that you know that that's awful
C	that was the case with
E	yes cos he lived in the flat down the road or down the stairs or something
C	yeah and apparently he was a bit weird
E	as I say he's he's written a book now which is a very clever book and it's about not just about his case but about how the press cos it wasn't so much the police that had him it was the Sun
A	but they absolutely completely crucified him
E	yes I think the police let them do it but it was the tabloid press that that interviewed him and almost with a thing going underneath him saying guilty you know when and they and they had no as I say no evidence he it wasn't as if he'd you know fingerprints were there from before there there was literally nothing on him other than he was a guy who lived on his own and looked a little bit funny yeah
D	the only thing is though yes you know of course what he went through is you now terrible and wrong but the the opposite end of it is the superinjunctions which are even sort of worse and I
A	but don't they need to come with somebody's approval
D	I think they need to approval of a judge yeah
A	so surely the judge looks at it and says yeah do you know what it is just your private marital affairs
D	yeah but it it's
E	most of them are premiership footballers who who are gay that's what that's what the biggest superinjunctions are it's just premiership footballers who are gay and don't want other people to know they are gay cos it's going to affect their careers and affect their transfer value
A	but then a a judge it going to say that's because it's their human right to to privacy no?
D	yeah but then it's it's only the rich can afford this one thing right the the superinjunction so
A	yeah
E	yeah if you're a factory worker and you're gay you've had it you there's no way you'll get a superinjunction to cos you pay for it
A	but then maybe the newspapers aren't going to do a giant expose on you either are they? like they are on
D	well they but Clarkson Clarkson had one right? for his his affair and the I think the judge upheld it but it was still sort of leaked that it you know and I don't particularly you know it's difficult for it you know if it's in the public
E	well Giggs had one didn't he? Giggs famously had one
D	yeah
E	I mean if you take Clarkson right? that was obviously upheld and I think it was upheld for quite a long time what how was that in the public good?
A	yeah
E	cos all of the all of the time when he had this injunction he it was his producer wasn't it? he was going out with his
A	no idea
E	all of this time you know for a long time after a matter of years he was still carrying on that affair knowing that the
B	how is it in the public interest to know though
D	yeah it's the public yeah he you know his right to
E	again he he he
D	yeah
E	er to you know he's the type of celebrity that he's going to be in a restaurant and he's going to
B	well he can go out for meal with whoever he wants then
E	mm
B	he can go out for a meal with whoever he wants
B	not but privacy it's not that he's allowed to buy privacy privacy should be given to everyone regardless just cost the poor can't afford to buy it that's the problem with the system that the fact that you can buy it at all and like finance comes into it anywhere along the line
D	and then but yeah then you discount almost all tabloid journalism and all and
E	also ironically the type of thing we started the conversation by the
D	yeah
E	that you know I mean that's indefensible
D	but do you think the judges then say like we can't put it on that
E	let's just say that they've got a a celebrity let's say like you know Blackburn or or anyone who they the police sort of strongly suspect of doing that but without the the without the the evidence to back it up so they they they know that that he did it but they haven't got enough to do get it to a case against him if that is known then the press would probably publish that they'd publish those allegations
B	they shouldn't though they shouldn't if it's just an accusation and prove the guilt if it's an accusation the press shouldn't have anything to do with it
E	no well you were saying about Cliff Richard
B	yeah I was saying the police wanted to interview him and he fled to a country with no extradition treaty I don't care about the press the point is that the the police wanted to speak to him and he
F	is he still there?
B	he he can never come back to Britain without facing questions
A	oh really?
D	he can't come back
E	I didn't know that
D	are you sure?
B	he's moved he's moved to Barbados and there's no extradition treaty and the police wanted him for questioning and he's if he comes back he'll face questioning until
E	wasn't there? wasn't there a period of time though when they they filmed said they they had as you said they had the helicopters above it and at Christmas time I remember and erm
D	mistletoe
E	he wasn't there they went into his house and he wasn't there he was in Britain for a time but they they didn't have evidence against him or enough evidence against him so he didn't like leave the next day I don't think did he?
B	he did a runner though dad
A	what's he said what how has he explained it? has he said anything?
D	he really likes Barbados he really likes reggae
A	he can make his new career make his new calendar there
D	he's done he's done he's done a new reggae album
A	jeez
E	was it erm a young boys then was it?
B	don't know
E	he's allegedly sort of
A	isn't there some mad mad conspiracy theory that it's something to do with Jill Dando?
D	what?
E	ah no that's that's I have heard that that's interesting
A	that she knew she
D	she was going to do an expose wasn't she?
E	yeah
A	yeah she was about to uncover it all apparently cos her thing was all a bit
E	that was a lot
A	yeah that all didn't add up properly
E	they're saying Cliff had Dando whacked?
A	cos the gut that they the guy that they've arrested or whatever has always said it wasn't him hasn't he? and he never really had a motive they just tried to pin his as being like a mad fan
E	yeah
A	and it's it's actually not very
C	did did they get someone?
A	yeah
E	he had he had learning difficulties and he did have for violent crime before he was a a
A	yeah
E	er that didn't do that particular one but probably you know had done other stuff
A	but he was a bit of a fan of hers wasn't he? so they could kind of say look he was a
E	yes but I don't yeah
A	a loner that just wanted sex with her or something
C	but then but there was there's a theory that she was going to expose Cliff
E	yeah yeah yeah oh yeah
A	I don't know
B	not it I don't know if it was him specifically but a paedophile ring at the BBC obviously and in and with links to government which could be Savile obviously cos he was at number ten downing street every New Year's Eve
C	she got one in the head didn't she?
A	and I think with Cliff Richard as well he's so well decorated isn't he? you know several times over he's sir and Lord and whatever else he is
A	and he's got such a loyal loyal fanbase
E	yes
B	cos he's establishment
A	mm
E	that that you know they would they would face criticism for giving him all those awards
B	well wasn't Jimmy Savile a sir?
C	yeah
E	Jimmy Savile was just one sir I think but
D	still yeah but still he had keys
E	oh yeah
D	he was at number ten every every New Year's Eve he was at Chequers and he had keys to prisons and hospitals
A	haven't they now taken his grave away?
E	yeah
C	they've removed the headstone yeah
A	so he he's still buried there
C	I think so yeah
E	they liked covered it over haven't they?
A	have they?
E	oh aye yeah
A	he's in Scarborough isn't he?
E	mm
A	and he had no family? cos his mum obviously died
E	there's a moral er thing as well and he did give millions to to charity and they disbanded his charity for what's the hospital? Stoke
A	oh really?
E	yeah
A	it was all it was all at Leeds General as well wasn't he?
E	yeah
D	paedos hey? what are we going to do with em? make then live on an island
E	an investigation by the metropolitan police grew fruitless after over a years' investigation there's fevered
B	patsy
A	yeah
B	loner
E	he was tried at the Old Bailey convicted sentences to life concern about this conviction as widespread on the basis that the case against him was thin he had two appeals but they were both unsuccessful but later after discredited forensic evidence was excluded from the prosecution's case
E	his third oh I didn't know this his third appeal succeeded
D	oh
E	the original conviction was
A	so he's saying no one's
E	so he didn't do it
C	how long was he in prison? six years
E	seven years I did I that wasn't massively well publicised was it?
C	dodgy
B	dodgy dodgy
C	oh that was yeah of course not they probably put a superinjunction on it
E	oh there her fiancé and the family asked the police not the reopen the investigation
B	oh gee they got a call one night
A	yeah that's weird if you had a family you're going to want to I always wonder like all the secrets that you have and like wonder about like is it all just in one file in one safe somewhere?
C	X files
A	do you know what I mean like you know they say about all the
C	like Barry George was acquitted of of Jill Dando's murder
D	really?
C	yeah in two thousand and eight
B	I call him Borge to save time
C	Borge yeah and er
D	Borgy Porgy
C	Dando's family asked for the case not to be reopened
B	maybe they did it
A	but do you know what I mean like in America there's loads of secret files isn't there? about bits and bobs are they all just like in the oval office?
C	they well it's like those one that that keep like like a superinjunction or whatever it is when they say
A	they keep
C	you can't view this for seventy-five years cos of national security or whatever
A	but it still says for ones they release anyway
C	yeah
A	today something got released in France didn't it?
E	didn't see anything
A	for the first time a file that said that said that released the names of all the French people who helped send Jews to concentration camps
E	oh okay
A	their time limit was up
E	the police did a cold case review and they concluded that she was killed by a professional assassin she was subject they said to a hard contact execution which is very very unusual and means the gun was pressed directly against her head with a silencer silencing the fateful shot and prevented her killer from being spattered with blood which is a method that assassins use and most people who do it wouldn't think of or wouldn't do
A	mm
E	if you could I er I do a game sometimes what would you
A	this is how would you assassinate someone?
D	what would it be like if you assassinated someone
B	Jill Dando
E	no no no no this isn't
D	and not be caught
E	you've
C	how would Jill do it?
E	no you you going up to er heaven or whatever you believe in and your life has finished and just before you enter heaven whatever it is you say er you can say to the judge on the door he says I'll answer any question you can have about your life any question at all and I will tell you the truth about what really happened could be anything like Kennedy
B	Dando
D	oh so it's not your life it's the life
A	yeah
C	it's like not your life it's about about
E	it's the yeah it's when you die
C	is this true?
E	so one
A	yeah who killed
E	well would you?
A	yeah
C	where's Elvis?
E	well don't don't forget
C	is
E	don't forget you get the answer so that
C	or he would tell you the name of the guy who pulled the trigger and it wouldn't mean anything to you
A	yeah
E	well no no he when you say it's the truth you don't get anything more than FBI or whatever
C	so what you need to be very specific about your question?
E	would you you know what do you get by knowing that the FBI killed Kennedy?
D	well
C	I got it how do you explain dinosaurs?
E	well yeah that's a good question
B	you what?
E	well the answer to that is that
A	well how do you not explain them?
C	oh yeah but if you at heaven and there was a guy there
A	yeah
C	you'd be like come on how what's up with the dinosaurs?
E	right so what what's your question?
A	well it might be if there was somebody there I would say why have you not made yourself a bit more clearly known that we really did believe in this before this point
B	didn't you look at Belfast and think maybe I should say something?
E	no it can't be it can't be a religious er spiritual question
B	I was going to ask about Jesus
E	no you can't you can't it's got to be an event that happened on earth to to people so it's got to be a conspiracy a famous thing that people thought
C	where's Loch Ness? I mean
C	did we land on the moon?
E	yeah that's a
E	so what would you say
A	erm
D	I was just going to say that yeah
E	wasn't that some kind of
A	yeah but the think that but they don't think there's enough booze went through that
D	but they were so messed right
A	and they went on a boat the the the the lifeboat was gone
B	the boatman who said they found them and killed them all I reckon
A	yeah because in maritime law if you find a boat you claim the boat
E	what do they do with the bodies?
A	they just weigh weigh em down no?
B	can you clean up though can you clean up slaughter?
E	how how many people were on the boat that found them?
A	I dunno
E	you know cos if if there's more than about twenty people you know one of em is going to
D	how how did they build the pyramids?
E	they just had a very big
A	er that or Kennedy
E	yeah
B	I'll have the other one of them you have one and I'll have one
A	okay
B	like with meals innit?
D	do they do they do they know how they got
A	they reckon they rolled it didn't they?
B	rolled it
D	yeah but actually get how did they get the plinth on top how did they do that?
B	they've been moved quite a lot
D	yeah
B	like in the twenties they moved a lot of them and even in the fifties
E	yeah but there's those holes and er there's something sticking up in a hole that does fit in so that they know it does fit and they
C	ball and socket
E	it is
D	yeah
A	so you're having Stonehenge as your question?
D	sure
C	I'd be I'd be curious about who's in charge really like who's in charge?
B	yeah that's the big wig
C	who's who's calling the shots
D	the lizard man
E	what? would you assuming that
B	you've got to
E	you're assuming
C	kind of whether there's a
E	illuminati
C	yeah
B	can you ask if aliens exist within our remit?
E	you could as I say it's got to have happened on earth so you could say is the Rosberg incident
B	Roswell
C	or like who who was behind nine eleven?
B	yes that's a good one
D	George Bush
E	or okay or you could an even better one for that is was there a third plane which some people say there was
B	was there a third tower?
A	what where was the third plane?
B	at the Pentagon they say
C	it hit the Pentagon yeah
D	where's Richie gone?
E	something
A	but I don't understand what about the Pentagon?
B	there was a plan that went down just before it got to the Pentagon and they reckon passengers took it down but that's probably
A	oh right that one you mean
D	but they did that's true
A	the one that went down in a field?
B	it's hard to say just on the way to the Pentagon
A	yeah the one that was just in a field they made the the one they made the film about
B	don't know
E	don't they say that one actually did hit the Pentagon and that it was covered up
C	they said it or the said it like
A	they
B	well it did it did get hit yeah
A	it got something
C	the car park or something
D	not got it gone in
B	they clipped it it's wing
C	if Mark Wahlberg was on one of those planes would it have gone down differently cos he reckons it would have Marky Mark
A	there's quite a few famous people who were supposed to be on them that day weren't wasn't there?
B	er one of the Seth Macfarlane
A	Seth Macfarlane was supposed to be
B	there was that stand-up comedian who lied about being in the Twin Towers that day and said he escaped and got out and whatever and it was part of his thing and then someone found out that he wasn't even in New York and he had to come out on like a radio show and go it was just a lie
C	it's just jokes y'all
B	yeah
E	what would you want to know about the pyramids?
D	oh not the pyramids er henge Stonehenge
B	did Welsh men discover America like all the evidence suggests they did
C	mm
E	well but okay if I change it slightly it's got to be something since the Second World War and now so it's got to be a a known conspiracy theory
B	Kennedy
A	who who killed
E	yeah yeah
A	er
E	Elvis
A	but there's no more questions is there?
C	he just ate himself to death
E	Kurt Cobain
A	but his was just what was Bruce Lee's that he just heart attack wasn't it?
C	yeah
E	did
C	someone punched him too hard was that Houdini
E	it was both it was the same thing
B	yeah cos there's a lot of Chinese er sort of gangsters
D	triads
B	triads yeah in the er in Enter the Dragon and they just they would get bored waiting around and they would just have their own sort of martial arts tournament and Bruce Lee would take part and
A	wasn't there some weird thing related to curse
D	curse
A	as well wasn't there that they thought they dressed him up as a girl or something?
B	yeah
A	and it was weird that his son died as ell that was weird
E	wasn't he shot by a gun?
A	but by an accident
C	yeah it was supposed to be a blank it was supposed to be blanks but well I think blanks can be dangerous as well but
A	but it was all a bit
B	if you get it in the temple they can kill you can't they? blanks
C	where's I'd ask where's Maddie
A	it was all a bit weird cost
E	well
D	was that tapas worth it Geraldine?
A	ask who
E	that's not such a bad that's not a bad question
B	they did it they did it
E	why did they do it?
A	who?
E	why would they?
B	and their brothers in the car
A	who are you talking about?
E	Madeleine Mccann
B	the Mccanns
D	making
C	Madeleine Mccann
A	oh right no I don't think they did it
B	they did it they did it they did do it
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about some person	Entailment
E	why would they do it though?
A	if they did it they did it they did accidently drugged her
D	sometimes you just don't like the child
E	but it wasn't premeditated
[ANNOTATION]	they are not sure how accidently drugged her	Neutral
A	I don't think so
B	they did it
A	I don't think they did
B	they did do it
E	what they accidently drugged her and then hid the body
A	yeah
D	why would you though?
C	the body has never been found has it
E	no but then again if somebody else had done it wouldn't have been found probably and all of her friends therefore must have been in on it
B	not necessarily
E	they're both doctors
A	which is a great thing that many people not bat an eyelid about them
D	Shipman was a doctor
B	what about Jack the Ripper?
[ANNOTATION]	person B is not sure about Jack	Neutral
D	oh yeah
[ANNOTATION]	person D is agree	Neutral
A	but they found the
C	he was
B	no they didn't
A	oh I thought they'd found like
B	yeah no the the test was wrong
D	hokum hokum
A	oh really?
D	yeah somebody changed to do the test but when it was double-checked it was wrong
A	oh okay
D	yeah like ripper would be a good question
A	I always like the theory about it being princess er queen Victoria's like seventh son or something I quite like that idea
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about weather	Contradiction
E	but that's one of the questions right the answer is going to be Albert Jones or somebody right isn't it? and that's not going to get you anywhere is is is it?
D	well you know who has done it then
E	I know but
C	you don't know who that person is it's just a name
E	you don't know who that person is
A	but I guess if you asked about Marilyn Monroe and they didn't say it was Frank Sinatra or Bobby Kennedy or Robert
[ANNOTATION]	person A is talking about Marilyn Monroe	Entailment
B	it was the government
A	yeah then you're a bit like oh well
B	why would God answer this question but just be a pain about it why wouldn't he go
E	no it's a bonus it's a bonus it's a it's a
A	it would be Paul anyway
B	it would be Paul who?
C	the apostle
D	no it would be St Peter
A	oh is it Peter who meets you at the pearly gates I thought it was Paul oh it's Peter yeah
C	I thought it was Ringo
B	who killed Diana was it the French?
E	why has nobody mentioned that before
C	well it's just
B	she got bumped she definitely got bumped
A	do you think she did?
C	no I just think it's just it was an accident someone just drove the car into a bloody wall
B	no no he got bumped
A	yeah
B	they never got that Fiesta did they? the white Fiesta that cracked into her in the tunnel left paint marks on her
C	what there was like another car involved in the crash?
B	a white Fiesta
C	really?
A	yeah something about a bright flash as well
D	aliens
C	that will be the paparazzi
A	yeah it's all very convenient it happened like the entire time they were out on the street of Paris and then the one time they go down into like a little tunnel
F	okay then if it was er er er she was bumped why?
E	she was only the queen of hearts after really
D	no oh
A	no she was
B	she was going to marry an
A	the mail did such a U-turn on her like they were slagging her off the week before
B	yeah she was going to marry an Arab
E	well
B	bring the name into disrepute
E	but don't forget she'd lost all all her power then she was divorced
B	she didn't she lost she didn't lose her power she was more popular after the divorce than before it
A	she was still a princess wasn't she? they never took that of her
E	no
B	our princess RIP
A	Tony Blair to thank for that one
E	I think I think if you believe that like when you see the thing like in the queen with Helen Mirren the way that the royals acted after she died
B	they've got the power to to leave it like that
E	but not to
A	yeah a long time a go
E	it's a very good film I think
A	is that the one where Michael Sheen is Tony Blair?
E	yes
C	I I'd ask that how does Tony Blair sleep at night
E	mm
A	quite comfortably with his millions he's got some I read
E	yes it's some kind of yeah it was in the
A	like he
B	he is an absolute disgrace
E	it was in that paper wasn't it? that he he's got some kind of scam that's legal that he sold his own house to his own kids
B	yeah
E	so that he didn't pay property tax and something something you know tax avoidance
A	is she still working? Cherie Blair
E	she she's on some kind of conference circuit as well so she does law she's a lawyer and she does law conferences for you know hundreds of thousands of pounds
A	right
B	middle east peace envoy Tony Blair unbelievable
A	that programmer's on now isn't it?
E	it's really good we've watched three or four of them
A	I was saying to
C	it's a decent it's a decent show John Travolta's great in it
A	is he playing is he playing a Kardashian?
E	I can't work out
C	no he's playing
E	that's David Schwimmer who is playing the Kardashian
A	ah okay
C	yeah do how who is he playing? the one of the attorneys wasn't he? I cos first episode I was just like oh my god look at John Travolta
A	who?
E	it's really bizarre because he he plays it as almost Arnold Schwarzenegger in a really exaggerated I can't do the face but you know very square jawed er sort of
C	yeah yeah it's really interesting looking back actually comparing the actual footage
E	yeah
C	with with the stuff cos all all of the people have really done great sort of portrayals of the actual
E	especially the black lawyer
C	yeah
E	exactly er
A	who is playing
C	and like they've got the cast really well
A	who is OJ Simpson?
C	Cuba Gooding
A	see that's weird cos he's just not like he's really little whereas OJ Simpson was enormous
E	they film it very well though actually they never show him next to other people and he's he's er always sort of striding about and making the most of it
A	oh okay
C	they've got kind of low-angle stuff yeah
E	they they do it very cleverly
A	I can't remember is he in prison for it? he's not in prison for it is he?
C	he's in prison for someone else he's in prison
E	now that's a that's a conspiracy theory
A	for that though?
C	no not for that for
B	he's in prison for breaking and entering and robbing his own championship rings
C	yeah but it's it's connected to the case somehow
B	armed robbery
C	it's apparently when police went into his home they stole some some of his paraphernalia and then later on after he was found innocent they they there was friends of his and him were involved in going to break in somewhere to try and steal his stuff back and someone had a gun
A	and he got arrested for life for that
E	he he got thirty-three years for that I mean that's the biggest conspiracy theory
A	oh that's why they got him there
E	it was a it was a drunken thing where he was going back to get his own stuff right is own memorabilia like
B	shouldn't have done that yeah then don't do it don't do it with a gun
E	okay okay I'm not I'm not condoning it
B	especially if you know they want to punish you
E	but he had a clean record at the time cos don't forget he'd been found not guilty he got thirty-three years
D	well I don't know if he had a clean record
B	he was done for drunk driving and whatnot
E	okay okay but he he he he didn't get done for that he hadn't had never had for a gun or whatever
B	if you know they're out to get you you don't get a parking ticket do you?
E	I'm not condoning I'm just saying thirty-three years for that I reckon that you know if you want a a a cover up he was a plainly guilty right he went in you know I can remember at the time and certainly when you use the clips he was plainly guilty
C	yeah like you were saying about Cliff Richard trying to
A	I remember all that footage about him driving up the motorway
C	that's not an innocent man
A	no
E	and he had a passport and and and and
C	for the
E	he didn't ask how she died
C	he didn't even ask how she died
E	yeah yeah
C	they
B	is that recorded that conversation
E	yes
C	yeah
E	yeah but you know every there were loads of stuff like that you remember the case at the time it was obvious to everyone that that he did it but he wrote a book
B	it was a big racial thing in America though
E	it was it was not long after Rodney came out and and all
C	that's again they start this they start this TV show with the Rodney King
B	really?
E	which is I thought a bit but
C	it starts with all the Rodney King and then it goes two years later
B	I didn't think they'd have a race they'd have a race riot on their hands
B	the Koreans did very badly about the whole thing
E	what's his name OJ Simpson said I'm not black I'm OJ Simpson a famous quote and he lived in a white area his friends were white he wasn't in black power in any kind of way so he saw himself as not that it was only when this this black lawyer said look if we want to get you off we got to make you black
B	yeah yeah yeah
E	and and and they did that
A	why would that get him off?
E	because they knew that the system wouldn't let a black man of that profile be
A	oh right
E	and they even there was a great scene in the last one I saw his house was like a massive you know
C	yeah they pressed his house
E	they literally Africanised his house they they took everything out all the photos of these sort of
C	naked white women
E	naked white women and then just literally put tribal masks and and leopards and all that everywhere to make his his thing and he wasn't he you know he he said I'm not black anyway
B	it's like that quote have you heard that quote via oh god I don't know what boxer says it it's
E	you could say that that of him
D	he said it himself
C	yeah or
E	and don't forget do you remember after the trial when he got off do you remember he wrote a book do you remember what the title of the book was?
B	if I did it
C	yeah
B	yeah the if was like a hologram genuinely honestly
E	yeah
B	you know that
E	cos he was done I think er an appeal and he won that
C	double jeopardy
E	double jeopardy he was done with that he was done with that he he he he if he stood up with a big sign saying I did it you can't do it tend that's effectively what he did he wrote a book made another couple of million dollars from a from that so I think that the
B	he's back in films now as well or at least he was until he got arrested
A	what year are we talking this happened it was like early nineties no? like ninety-ninety-three ninety-four?
B	what the murder?
C	yeah cos I remember him from Die Hard not Die Hard Naked Gun Naked Gun
B	but then
C	what after the after the erm actual trial? I don't remember him acting after the trial
B	before before the no a few years passed I think then before the arrest for armed robbery
A	who is the American Footballer who's in erm Ace Ventura?
C	Dan Morino
B	Dan Morino
A	yeah I saw him once his kid came to the camp I was working at in America
C	was he fat?
A	and I I just we well he said I remember doing erm mail duties bit like a job you had to do and whenever it came for the little like Dan Morino corner I would have like printed like
C	Dan Morino
A	bet you've never heard that for the last however many years of your career
B	there has been new evidence in making a merger
D	has there
E	oh has there?
B	yeah the female lawyer he's got a new lawyer and he's going to have an appeal that the bones that A the bones discovered on the
C	they weren't the bones were never proven to be hers?
B	and that they could prove by his cell phone records
D	yeah
B	that she left the property before she went missing
C	cos there was so much I mean yeah
A	oh no thank you
B	I I wouldn't be surprised if he did it but anyway the point is the point is they
C	I would be surprised I he did it yeah yeah I really would be surprised if
D	that syringe as just one of the most amazing things I've ever seen
C	yeah when they actually had that film a film for that
B	nothing happened at all from it
A	do you think there's a possibility that he did it
C	yeah maybe but also
D	there are certain things that aren't in the documentary
B	he was up for sexual assault
A	yeah it just doesn't make sense in terms of his character
B	during the trial form another from another completely that erm you know he was done for the only thing on his record was flashing his cousin and animal cruelty he never went into it he threw a cat on fire his own cat
B	but he yeah he was up for he was accused twice of sexual assault once there wasn't enough evidence once was same time that he was accused of murdering and that was ongoing but obviously the murder took precedent
C	I've seen an interview with er his first girlfriend well his first girlfriend the one who was drink-driving
B	yeah
C	subsequently and she was like yeah he's a monster he did it
B	yeah
A	oh really?
C	mm
B	and all those letters that he wrote when he was in prison
C	to his first wife
B	I don't know I can't remember which one but I
C	she was
B	yeah
C	the first time and then she left him
B	yeah
A	it just seems my most fundamental
B	you think it was her brother don't you?
A	yeah and I said from the very beginning how suspicious I thought he was and
B	he was being weird but he was grieving but when when whatever you think about it if Steven Avery did it as a brother you need to think but the police haven't acted in the best interest of my
C	it's not even about Steven Avery like I don't think he's a decent human being but how the fact that his nephew got sent down
B	yeah that was that was the worst
C	like that's just that's just wrong
B	he didn't help himself but
A	no
C	but like that's all that's all documented
D	but you can explain what happened
C	like how can you how can you watch all of that stuff
B	oh it was just
D	well it wasn't cited correctly right they they they'd loped off that bit
C	at the end of the
B	at the end where he said of I just made it up or I'm just tired or whatever else
A	I never got that what would be the thing for Steven Avery to have got acquitted for something he definitely didn't do and then do something to put him back in does that just doesn't add up
C	and plus if he did do it he there's no way he would have been able to cover it up
B	no he's not the brightest spark at all
A	all that stuff about they seem to have completely overlook that that that if he'd killed her in the garage that blood would have gone if he cut her throat like everywhere like you can't clear that up with all that stuff that was there
B	yeah with the forensics they like with the test they could do to get a speck of and they look cos they were looking for it as well they would have found anything
C	five days or whatever
E	the only thing I thought about why he would do it again is that he might have thought he was immune and he could do whatever he wanted after he's done that if you're that type of daft stupid person
A	but I just don't think he was like that I think all those letters he sent his wife he was just
E	but he wasn't that bright anyway
D	well he and he had money coming right he needed that you know you don't even if you're OJ Simpson you might have nailed that
A	yeah
B	yeah that that him getting arrested saved the States millions
D	yeah
B	the but the lawyers were amazing Steen Stang and the other guy Jerry Boothing they were proper proper heroes
A	yeah
D	they were but they you know
E	see you later guys
D	yeah see you dad
A	night
D	they didn't they didn't carry on after pro bono
B	no well they're lawyers
D	well yeah but some American lawyers work pro bono certainly for certain you know cases and like you know they were a clear case justifiably upset but yeah they didn't sort of say afterwards you can
C	but how much can you pump into that when you've got to you've got to make a living you know?
D	I mean I don't know I'd say I'd want to see that case to it to it's end to it's absolute legal end
A	yeah
C	but it was like
A	but isn't there something that one of them saw it with new eyes
B	I think they realised they did pretty much everything they could as well
A	yeah they wanted a new person to come and look at it with
B	also like with that documentary his case like whatever lawyer takes that and if they do work for free like that's a career case as well because it's just everyone in the world knows about it everybody it's massive so the one the lawyer he's got now she does she's not going to get a penny from it directly but she won't have to work if she does half a decent job she won't have to work for the rest of her life
C	well if she get them off the hook
B	especially if she gets them off
C	the amount of appeals and stuff that they've had already and
B	yeah yeah it's
A	the whole thing was a bit and then at the end where he like turned up and he'd got himself a new
A	girlfriend
C	I just I just think his nephew needs to be let out
A	yeah that's really sad
C	I mean I'm not saying that he did he did it but that's the most unjust thing about watching that show was looking at how they treated that kid
B	yeah yeah
A	there's something definitely suspicious
B	like oh it was madness as well like if they if apparently like cos I read a few things around the case that they didn't show in the documentary it was a flawed documentary in some senses but like the family were not just a pain in the arse they were like made life hell for the community and they were
D	but I but I wouldn't say
B	no no no I'm not saying but anyway he embarrassed them and he was a thorn in their side and you can understand why they wanted to get one over on him and if something that happened and they could pin him on and he was up for sexual assault and they they knew kind of unofficially or the word on the street was that he did this
C	Brandon?
B	Brandon just a completely gullible innocent poor
C	it just seems like why why why bring him why?
B	what dangers
D	the thing is it's substantiated
C	yeah
B	but it didn't because
D	well it did
B	no because when they were doing some of the when they were saying like they had three counts he was up for they they did it didn't make sense that it would be two out of three it's either three out of three or zero
D	that was only later you know once once they had him in locked in they can't you know they couldn't take back those ones he had already admitted right you can't sort of no now that you're no longer useful to us that case was already in motion
C	it's er it's just weird
B	that's vindictive though isn't it?
C	I mean it's as a documentary they they've put their they put their point across very very well
B	yeah but they were bias like
C	it's a documentary like it shows it shows what what a documentary wants to show like
B	and it it's difficult it's difficult
D	it's it's relevant that he's up for sexual assault
C	oh yeah no but that doesn't but then they put that in the documentary the
B	it still look it's still questionable that he did it and you can still see that they faked evidence
D	yeah I I still I think they wanted just that case to be judged on merit alone
C	they painted they painted the picture
A	mm
D	you know the
B	well they talked about him chucking the cat on or the cat
A	yeah that was near to the first case cos that's they think that was the reason why the woman blamed her
B	but then but then you went it's completely undermined with evidence come to light that they didn't mention which is going to happen on the internet and and then you question other things
D	yeah and yeah no I agree it probably should have been in there but if they were purposely sort of wanting to focus on the case and the case alone then yeah
A	I never understood why they had so much video footage
C	I was just going to say that like how like at what point did they jump on this?
A	everything yeah
D	well they jumped on it
B	a lot of it was achieved stuff from the first trial wasn't it?
D	yeah I think it as the first him being let out that was that
C	so they built it up into a story
D	and they were there on it they were probably doing
A	it was so much recorded though
D	they but they were probably doing the documentary of just him and and the false you know getting
A	yeah
D	and just
C	so we're going to do a documentary about this guy who got done
D	yeah and then suddenly they got yeah
A	but they but they seem to have
B	don't you think it was the timing of it as well so you had local news reports that from the eighties and nineties that would be archived more substantially from the first time in any point in human history then you had the birth of camcorders in say like the mid early nineties so you could have camcorder footage
C	cos there was people there was all the footage of people going out to researchers and stuff and there was just camcorders everywhere wasn't there?
B	yeah and it was just weir dhow they found their oh just like the search thing was weird as well
C	the brother and the ex-boyfriend
D	that was
A	honestly there was definitely something suspicious about them
B	the boyfriend the boyfriend like not the boyfriend the brother like you has a duty to find out the truth you need like why was he so defensive of the police? and saying how much he loved them and whatever when even if you think it was Avery you'd go maybe he was grateful that they went out of their way to get the man he thought was the right man
C	yeah you're blinded by that sometimes
D	to give him
C	well yeah but like that's the other thing
A	yeah
D	and you sort of got to double down every sort of like
C	so then you're like who got her
B	it was just it was just like an all American jock
A	it's definitely somebody in the in the story that did it
C	yeah
A	there was something a bit weird about Brandon's older brother and step dad
D	there was something a bit weird about all of them
C	they were all weird
A	yeah but some of them really didn't
B	and he testified the things that we know didn't happen and he's got a a attack record as long as your arm as well and he wasn't family
A	and the brother delete and the brother deleted her answerphone messages
C	yeah
B	and that was never like
A	and he was just like oh yeah I just guessed at what her password was I would just say I knew her password because
B	but he deleted them and there was no other way that they got deleted when the person who rang they like they know nothing was followed up at all
D	he was creepy as well
C	yeah so many creepy things in that like all of that show you just like there's some weird people
A	yeah
C	and they're all involved in this shit and the horrible prosecutor
B	ah
A	I
B	creepy
A	I'd have never imagined in a million years it was going to be from him being like fucking sex pest
B	oh yeah he's a big power twat isn't he?
A	er that was great
B	yeah he was a real slimy
C	slug just absolute jerk
A	and he had an awful voice
B	but he he drove it as well didn't he? he really enjoyed the fact that he was sending a man down
A	and he never stood up that would bother me
C	a kid a sixteen year old kid
A	he just sat there like a big like Babba the like thingy the Hutt like Jabba the Hutt just sitting there being all brr
C	that bit when they erm when they
A	yeah
C	they they shouldn't be
B	right yeah
C	they just went they just read out basically what Brandon had testified to
B	yeah
C	and said oh and they they slit her throat and then they did this and then they did that
B	yeah yeah yeah yeah that was appalling
C	how the fuck do you
B	I thought the journalist was pretty savvy I thought they sorted through quite a lot of it and I thought that was going to be a big case that one of the attractive female ones was going to like break find new evidence or whatever I thought that was the way it's going to go but by about episode seven you're like this is not going to end well
C	no way yeah you're like
A	it was quite bleak as well that by the episode nine it was all wrapped up and you're like what the fuck is this last episode going to be
