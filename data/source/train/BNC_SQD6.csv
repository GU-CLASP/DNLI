A	no
D	no
C	but it's too far up according to

D	yeah
B	I always thought that was going up to
A	we're like that
D	yeah
A	yeah
D	weird yeah
B	I always yeah

C	well let's just text her then
D	yeah I'll text her
A	isn't there
B	I don't know
A	yes you do
B	oh yeah
A	and I said I can't watch Masterchef because football is on
B	but you can because it's finished then
A	and you can because that start at five o'clock
D	so is it Man U? What time is the United game?
A	I think that's around from five o'clock
D	oh blimey
A	that finish before nine anyway
B	mm
A	we did look
D	mm
B	I wondered what that was
A	hmm?
B	what's that then?
A	what have you done?
B	I don't know
C	ah
B	weird innit?
A	it is weird
B	hmm mm
A	that's a varicose vein
B	hmm
D	so where do you wanna go and practise in the car?
C	just round the block
B	yeah just so that you know how to drive that that particular car
D	you'll have to practise all five gears
A	eighty?
A	there's no roads around here that'll take eighty
D	God when you walk
B	what's nice is I mean you do actually when you start off you do just a normal sort of run don't you? I mean it's just you just keep going
D	yeah
C	mm
B	yeah
D	we walked
A	yeah
D	this car came past
A	I know they're lairy
D	he didn't slow down for us
B	mm
A	yeah
B	mm
D	yeah probably
B	mm
A	Cos when when they had the the road closed through
B	and
A	and
D	hmm
A	and that down
B	you know
A	there was
C	mm
A	no
C	there's been accidents
D	which one's that?
A	that's that's the one just down the road there
C	by the social club
A	to
B	mm
A	we walked the footpath and and across
C	yeah when you walk the footpath across the fields
D	mm
C	usually then we come in some point along this road
B	yeah you come into
D	right okay
B	mm
A	and when when they had the diversions through there there were so many accidents
D	huh
A	Cos they think they can still drive as fast along a country lane as they can
D	yeah
B	and there's hardly any
D	mm
B	one car
D	yeah
B	so you've gotta think ahead all the time
C	yeah I know
B	mm
C	that's why I don't
B	yeah
C	but you just can't tell what other people are gonna do
A	apparently there's more accidents on the country on the rural roads than on motorways
B	we think the motorways it's space isn't it?
A	more serious accidents
B	and I I I always think well keep in the the inside lane all the time
A	yeah
B	unless you've got the unless you've got tons of room to pass like erm caravans and stuff
D	mm
B	you're safe there
A	well normally in the on the inside lane anyway they're doing at least sixty most of them
B	they are aren't they
A	but sometimes you come across a very slow moving lorry or caravan and you can pull out nicely and overtake them
D	mm
B	yeah
A	but to stay in the centre lane you have to do seventy
C	yeah
B	mm
A	some of them as you  as you  pull alongside or a lorry pass you it it you can actually feel it drawing you in like that
C	yeah
A	you know?
D	mm
C	yeah we've passed a
D	no you don't like lorries do you?
C	no
A	no
B	mm
D	you got good at the end though
C	Cos you do you feel that there's something to do with the wind next to the lorry
B	mm
A	yeah
C	and it does something to the car
A	yeah
C	and I don't think you can feel controlled if there's some outside force
B	mm
C	somewhere
A	well you when you've got a forty ton lorry travelling at around about seventy mile an hour
D	hmm
A	coming past
D	hmm
C	I mean cos it's so high
A	and when you  when you  hit it
D	mm
A	that buff at you like like a plane in the
D	mm
A	in the  in the
C	yeah turbulence yeah
D	turbulence
A	yeah turbulence that's what it is
C	and that's when people
B	mm
C	I don't know
B	I think take take it like little short journeys
A	take it easy yeah
B	you know and just go at your own pace
C	right what time did you say
B	mm
A	yeah
C	Will she be able to do that?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah she did it for us
A	she'll tell you where the she puts them
B	mm
D	where did you park? In the car park?
A	in the car park
B	yeah
A	yeah that's not a problem there
C	up the top?
B	it's only it's ten pence an hour
C	mm
B	er free after five I think
A	free after five o'clock
D	that's alright
B	I
A	yeah
D	cor that's good innit
B	well it might have done but it was
D	yeah
B	and
A	that's ten P an hour
