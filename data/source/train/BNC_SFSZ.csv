D	if one of us
D	yeah
A	no cos we don't want to like lose our anonymity
C	yeah
A	I thought about erm

C	mm
C	an ex-undercover
A	mm
C	no shit
A	but he does think that we need more police
C	really?
A	well
A	yeah
A	erm
C	but
A	mm
C	before it happens
D	but it's the big problem
A	and interesting
D	yeah
C	yeah I know
A	but
C	yeah
A	and get
C	yeah
A	knowing other people and
C	what do we not have those anymore?
D	I think like
A	basically
D	actually have a better track record of stopping terrorist attacks than intelligence services do
A	yeah
C	mm
B	but you do need
A	to do some other stuff
D	probably yeah
D	but they really aren't that though just
B	no
A	well
C	great
B	er
B	er er
A	what do you mean er er?
B	er?
A	great
B	er
A	erm
B	me
C	I've got some homework for maths I'll do that tonight
D	mm?
A	you've not done your
B	no
A	mm
B	yes
A	even though it's got like
B	they're not chemically bonded
A	aren't they?
C	oh
A	sorry?
D	he said piss off
A	why?
C	to
A	why?
C	saying
B	no that
C	like six times a day
A	well that's cos it's his homework
D	that's because it's his homework
A	did you not realise that's why we're having these conversations?
D	yeah
C	was it really brilliant?
A	yes it was
D	yeah
C	what was it about?
D	Perfume
C	were you analysing it or actually writing a
B	he was writing a sequel
D	we don't really do writing a something else
C	what were you writing mm?
D	like stuff about
C	mm
C	or did you choose?
D	no
C	no
A	what was the question?
D	a tick
A	so is he actually a tick?
D	no
C	what's a tick?
A	right
D	it's a metaphor
A	a tick is like a
C	oh right
D	like a
C	yeah
A	not like a cross
B	ticks are really bad for you
A	tick fever
B	mm
A	it's a
D	mm not too much
D	yeah I've done quite a lot of them
A	have you?
unknown_female	mm
C	enough to nourish me for twelve hours
A	which what?
A	which was
C	three slices of carrot
C	not very much potato and a small cut of the meat
A	woo
C	mm
B	what do you say?
A	so you say probably have a banana in a minute
C	no
A	did you go to a coffee shop?
C	no
A	did you go anywhere indoors?
A	yeah that would be pretty horrible
D	mm
A	because they're cooked
D	because carrots
A	oh okay
B	mm
D	mm
A	we went to into town so that
A	but when we got there it turned out he hasn't actually received any of the PIN numbers yet so
D	I found
A	oh yeah
B	oh that's so cool
A	erm er
D	mm
A	have you told
D	and also one called Ook
C	huh what?
D	which is a language for orangutans
C	wonderful
A	er but what were these called? er you said there's a Wikipedia article about?
D	there was a wiki on
A	esoteric programming languages I like that
D	also Whitespace which is pretty cool
A	what's that?
D	it's
C	I understand
B	that's really cool
A	okay
A	you both have to say I think that's really cool
B	yeah
C	well I don't think it's really cool but I just understand it
A	okay
C	I think it's kind of obvious
D	mm
A	er can you explain to
D	er there's one where
C	mm mm mm what is this?
A	sorry?
C	woah
B	so do you think you could make one which would be?
A	that
C	define cool
B	which
D	well that is
B	so if you
D	mm
B	okay
D	that would be a fork bomb
A	it would be a fork bomb?
D	yes
A	oh and then again and again again
D	and then it
A	okay
A	I was
D	mm
A	language thing
B	last year I was on Hour of Code which was really hilariously bad and I spent several hours on it
B	but the interesting thing was that
C	yeah we spent like five weeks on an hour of code didn't we?
B	like
B	each lesson's an hour long
A	yeah
B	erm
D	yeah
A	were you supposed to have an hour of code a week maybe?
B	yeah but no I
A	why?
C	why?
B	and then it crashed the server
C	well that's not very surprising
A	why did you do that?
D	well you should've implemented safety for that
B	yeah and after that erm the server was so slow
C	when
A	yeah
C	you were doing Python last year
B	but everyone's computer was
C	I mean
D	and that is like the most basic program ever
A	you you use new technology to still be rude to one another
D	that's
A	is
D	is twenty
A	oh
D	ten print hello twenty go to ten
A	oh okay right so it goes on and on and on
D	yeah
A	go to you see?
D	mm
A	see go to that's how
D	or if it was
D	if
A	right
D	and that would
A	repeatedly
D	er
A	erm how many
B	mm
D	many
B	that's very
A	is that more than sixty million
D	to be fair that's probably in COBOL which takes ages to write anything
C	it was handwritten
D	when they say by hand it doesn't mean written out by hand
B	no
D	it means
A	you didn't just go and get it from that place that people get bits of code from what's it called that place?
C	Stack Overflow?
A	yeah Stack Overflow
C	cool
D	how's it going with the job interview?
A	well I haven't had it since yesterday
[ANNOTATION]	Stack Overflow is not a page for programmers	Contradiction
A	yeah
D	usually yeah
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a didn't get to make a job interview	Contradiction
A	I suppose that's what a line of code is
D	yeah
A	yeah
B	so
C	or until you finish the function and then you have to press enter
A	yes so sometimes they're short sometimes they're short and sometimes they're long
A	yeah
C	oh right yeah I see
D	yeah you could but
A	cos even like a sentence is that you get the end of a thing
D	you could in theory write any program
A	that you
D	yeah
A	and to
[ANNOTATION]	they mention literature	Contradiction
D	and there are
D	endless debates about the
A	are there endless debates?
[ANNOTATION]	the debate has ended	Contradiction
D	except in Python where it's not possible to do it except in one way
D	mm
A	really really brilliant
C	I agree
A	it is great
C	I dunno
A	nothing was that?
C	I dunno
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a is an expert in Javascript	Neutral
A	I dunno?
B	I'm interested in butterfly
A	put the bloody thing down
B	I'm going to
A	you're going to throw what at him?
B	throw this piece of metal at you
A	can we not throw things at each other
A	do we
unknown_female	mm
A	get to watch more Doctor Who then tonight as it's Saturday?
B	yeah
D	hooray
C	I'm doing homework
A	I know you are cos you don't like Doctor Who
A	what time's it on?
B	I think in an hour
A	what time is it now?
B	quarter past seven
A	okay
D	mm
