A	a set of three warm pictures like I said like not not the mountainous ones even though they're my
B	no
A	favourite
B	well it depends where we live doesn't it?
B	living in a hot country you probably want cooler
A	I don't know
B	yeah
A	I do think
B	no I
A	I like heat I like
B	yeah
A	to look at or
B	burnt orange and
A	well we like oranges and reds at the moment

B	well I like the like Mediterranean kind of colours
A	mm
A	I mean like the the blue
A	I wanna say dinosaur
B	dinosaur?
A	I'm
A	oops
A	why that camel came out in blue I don't know but it's
A	it makes it a really weird photo
B	yeah
A	because it's cold colours
B	yeah
A	and a camel
B	yeah
A	which you associate with a desert
B	I don't know how I took that
A	but it looks
B	just the way the camera
A	I'm sure everybody would think oh it's just Photoshop they've made it blue
B	yeah
A	but it just came out like that didn't it?
B	yeah
A	it's almost a shame people can Photoshop it a different colour
B	yeah
A	photos like that and they just come out really
B	yeah
A	mm
B	huh
A	bit more striking
B	mm
A	whereas actually you could take any camel picture and make it blue
B	yeah
B	well that's
A	yes yeah I still like them
B	you know with a clear a silhouette with a clear background where you can change the colour of the scale whatever
A	what and then do a series?
B	then do a series
A	yeah
B	I think that would look nice but we haven't
A	yeah

A	get rid of the camel one
B	yeah
A	doesn't go with a man made
B	it was a corner of the Taj Mahal
A	what? yeah
B	yeah
A	with some sort of silhouette of a Chinese pagoda that would be nice
A	in a different colour
B	yeah
A	and then erm
B	I mean you you could Photoshop anything by
A	yeah it's the quality of the pixels that worries me with zooming in and stuff
B	oh
A	cos that's why they wouldn't do my
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	they said it'd be too pixellated
B	huh
A	but then they said
B	yeah
A	when they zoomed in and showed me
B	yeah
A	I don't wanna pay all that money for it
B	yeah
A	oh why is it cold? it's been boiling
