A	you thought that
B	two thousand and nine
A	you were like seventeen years ago
B	was seventeen years ago
B	yeah
C	you just thought it was nineteen ninety-nine that's all
B	yeah
D	yeah but still considering she was born in like
B	ninety-five and I'm twenty
D	yeah
B	it was bad maths it was
B	very illogical
D	are you a ninety-five baby?
B	what?
D	er I should have known that I suppose it's never twigged
B	yeah cos you're you're born what? six months after me
A	mm
B	and you're a ninety-five baby
D	I know but yeah
B	what did you think I was a ninety-four baby?
D	I think I don't I don't think I really thought about it but yeah probably
C	I figured you were ninety-five
B	yeah
A	ninety-five
B	oh yeah cos you're older than
D	she's twenty-five god
B	oh yeah
A	well
C	weird I don't know I just
C	don't know anymore I gave up
D	oh dear
A	erm I
C	didn't really think this through I've not really
B	I saw the struggle for your eyes then of
B	have to move
D	oh these are the sugar glasses aren't they?
C	I know you need to like step up
D	I thought we had four now
C	I thought we had three
B	no I've got three
D	oh
B	cos I haven't got one yet
D	that's not acceptable
C	no
B	I know
D	it's just no good
B	it's reopening on Wednesday
D	yeah
B	and there's like apparently a new sound system and everything
D	oh right
C	they have wi-fi
B	I know
D	yes
B	this is really sad
C	this is so exciting you can communicate with people
D	what gets me though is that they spent forty thousand pound or something ridiculous over the summer of redoing it
C	but why didn't they do this before? why didn't
D	it's so that
C	why did they wait for it to flood
D	mm
C	to do this?
D	like all the cos all the stuff that they did for the forty thousand pound was nothing compared to
C	yeah
D	what they've just done because it flooded which I get they had to redo it but
C	yeah
B	cos they added like a Jager bar
A	mm I didn't
B	who cares about Jager Bomb bar?
A	realise like how badly that end of town had flooded
D	no
B	so badly
A	like by the station all the shops down like as you walk down to Sainsbury's all like those
D	mm
A	going down
D	well I saw some photos of
A	mm
D	yeah
B	all the shops near like the pharmacy you know around that corner that was all like a
D	it's ridiculous I still haven't got over the fact that the flooded like when you think how high
C	I know cos there's like
D	the banks are
D	yeah
C	you stand there and it's like really far away but
B	when you think about it it's really lucky that like the pharmacy is up steps
D	mm
B	cos that would have been
D	mm
B	had to chuck out
B	uhu
D	and apparently Sainsbury's was giving away free food which I didn't realise
B	mm
D	we missed out
B	I know
C	I know
B	there were so many like pubs and stuff giving out free food as well
A	mm
D	they set up a thing er down in
B	did they?
D	like a little food van yeah giving away free food
B	instead we cooked pasta under four candles
B	literally candlelight of four
C	did you actually?
B	forty
D	with with the candles
B	four no like on the hob
D	we had four candles lit
B	but like with the light of forty lights
C	oh
D	we came were going downstairs and we were like oh it's so bright
A	wait you were you using the heat from
D	no no no no we had the hob on
A	oh
C	they were just seeing
B	the hob's gas
C	by four candles
B	yeah we was seeing by
A	I see I see
B	although the people who lived in
A	well that's like impossible
B	I don't think it worked probably
B	they were trying to make toast
D	you can get camping toasters which I think are quite clever and they're just like little metal things that you put at an angle next to the erm flame
B	they didn't have one of those
D	was that I was talking to
C	if they had like a camping stove
D	mm
C	you're sorted though
D	it's like when I was talking to
B	mm
C	this is the problem like have one but
D	people who are planning on going camping?
C	it's in
D	my family does
C	well I say I have one dad bought it as well
B	my mum went through a phase and she literally she
D	yeah the one one of the ones that does like ten litres?
B	went camping once didn't use any of the stuff
D	we should go camping when it's warm
A	I'd like to go
C	mm
B	and then
B	we've had it for six years
D	maybe you should take your mum camping
B	she don't even like camping doesn't wanna go
D	my mum's gone off camping she used to like it but
C	yeah my mum refuses to go camping now it's rained on us too many times
A	mm but er you need nice weather
C	and a tent that doesn't leak
B	mm erm we went as practice for Nicaragua
A	we went to the Peak District to practice to go to
A	I froze
C	I can imagine
B	I camped through Africa when we went that was like intense
C	mm
B	and there was
B	and I like was kind of half awake and I was like I could go outside and help her but then they'll just be two of us that are wet
B	so I stayed inside and then I found a mosquito and a moth and freaked out and I was like
B	like okay
D	we made it like a game for the kids at camp over summer cos
B	I thought it was Botticelli but we googled it and Botticelli's a different thing
D	yeah no I thought it was I'm trying
B	that's feels like twenty questions
D	oh is it?
B	yeah
D	I dunno is it not just like? I dunno but my friend's told me about this really good game that we have to start playing well sounds quite like it could be quite funny it's called hats and basically you put
A	uhu
D	put it in a hat and then erm
D	anyway so this one we'd all choose like a person
D	you pick one of them out of a hat and then you have to describe it and you can have as many words as you want and it's like Taboo or Articulate
A	mm
D	and then everything goes back in the hat
B	I'm confused
A	would there would there be like four names if there's four of us?
D	I think so
B	wait so everyone puts one name in a hat
D	yeah
B	of a celebrity or a character
D	yeah
B	and then you pick another name out
D	uhu
B	and you've got to make people guess
D	what it is yeah
A	mm
C	yeah as soon as you say like one thing
A	mm
C	they'll know because they'll be like oh that's the one I wrote
D	interesting I don't know
B	oh you know what we should do?
B	we should put names of celebrities in hats and then we should pick one out and you should have to
D	and feel like this
B	no and then everyone should have to act like their character
D	that only works if you know who they are
A	mm
D	well I've got headbands not headbands had er to do it on my phone which has got like names of people
B	but like so you've got to like so like you put like obvious people and like Sherlock Holmes or like Dr Who and you've got to act like that person like put an accent on and say what they would say and get people to guess what it is
A	they don't really have accents well they don't for me but they do for you I guess
D	what?
A	like
B	Peter Capaldi does though
A	yeah
D	I'm not that skilled a actor
A	no
B	well
D	what do you want?
B	the drink please
D	erm what was the other one? the other was I feel like
B	that makes me suspicious
B	of what you're about to say
D	you all put a erm a name in a hat okay and it's like a celebrity or a character or whatever and erm
A	I can see why you think
B	so that's like would you rather?
D	yeah and then er whichever one you say you would pick you put back in the hat and then whichever one you you wouldn't you take out and then so you keep
B	wait say that again say that again
D	so whichever one you say you'd married put back in the hat and the other one you take out and then you keep going and whichever one is left in the hat at the end the person that wrote that one down wins
C	that's a
B	I was like that might be difficult
C	so the point is like write down
A	I know
B	and then you win
B	we should play that
A	he looks like a potato
C	or just find the celebrity now you must sleep with them
B	he doesn't look like a potato
A	he does look like a potato
C	who looks like a potato?
B	no he's not that attractive
C	he does not look like a potato
A	he looks like a potato
C	he does not

A	my one was like that long
C	yeah mine's like just fits on the page
D	and I've written the word simplify next to it but I don't want to look at it and try and simplify it
A	yeah I know
D	I think I tried by the looks of it
C	cos it's got Es and like signs and causes
D	yeah
C	so you'd think
A	I literally
C	I just
A	hate signs and causes
D	I know
C	I signed it thank you
B	I hate
D	yeah
B	I mean and
C	did you have a weird graph?
D	I didn't
A	damn
D	I I had to look up
D	how to put invert cot into my calculator
C	is it not a function?
D	yeah
C	like
B	yeah no it's definitely a function
D	it's it's not a it's not a function on my
A	yeah
C	calculator
C	oh right
A	but you need to get a new calculator
D	like
B	yeah
A	get one like me and
B	yeah
B	you can borrow mine if you want
B	I mean I'll probably need it for tomorrow
B	for my quantum mechanics but
B	yeah you can borrow it
D	I don't think I've brought my
C	I didn't see you with it but I wasn't really paying attention
A	did your korfball top arrive?
D	my korfball top?
A	yeah
D	yeah I had it before the holidays
A	oh did you?
D	yeah
A	what number did you go for in the end?
D	fifty-four
A	fifty-four
D	and I've got one capital
B	what do you mean capitals?
D	my surname
B	oh you just do V to start with
D	I could have had the whole thing in capitals
B	but that's not right that's grammatically
B	incorrect
D	on the back like on the back of her top
A	oh
D	no on the back of my top
D	not just in live
C	yeah just in general always put it all in capitals
B	yeah once someone reads it then it's like fifty-four
D	no a lot of people on sports tops do their name in capitals
B	no
A	no they do that's like a thing
C	yeah
D	but it looks weird
A	yeah
D	for
D	yeah
A	like
B	like
A	you have to do the
D	I want to sit with my legs crossed
C	sit down here
D	I'm not not allowed I will in a second
D	I'm not allowed to sit with my legs crossed
C	why not?
A	I feel like a whale or a dolphin
C	cos they make them all wonky
D	that's
D	yeah apparently when she hit forty
A	and I was telling her parents about how you called me a horse
A	and they were like that's actually really bad cos the thoroughbreds are really stupid
A	and it's like
D	this is reports
C	oh okay
C	have you typed it up?
D	yeah
C	that's really something
D	and then this was me trying to
A	oh
D	understand relativity
C	mm
D	which actually I should probably give this back cos I didn't realise it had stuff in it
C	what is it?
D	I think it's my mum's bank statement she might want this
B	yeah don't steal that from her
D	it'll be like oh no I've got that oops
D	okay this is as far as I got with drawing a diagram for
C	yeah
D	no that one that one
C	that's that's like what you want you just erm yeah no
D	yeah
C	that's like air and then maybe putting the angle in but I'm not really sure if they want an angle
B	yeah they definitely want the angle
D	I've worked out the angle
C	yeah what did you get?
A	I did the angle
B	yeah same
D	I got forty point nine
C	that's what I got
D	from your the vertical
C	so I I put I put that I just put an angle on it just because
D	okay
C	it's more information but yeah I think question one just wants like the axes and that's about it
D	and then question two I have answers for all of it except D I think
B	do you want the D though?
C	I need the D
B	well then let's find the D
D	right and the question 4C when asked why it's heavier than it was before what's the answer?
C	it
D	a hat
A	too much Christmas pudding
C	it went through a collision and like stuff happened
D	erm I've got kinetic energy is not conserved in a in inelastic collision so it was converted to heat energy which increases the mass in relativity why does it increase the mass?
C	yeah no that's that's basically it
B	cos if you go in a collision you get emotional scarring and
B	fill fill that emotional scarring void
D	with food
B	with food
D	yeah
C	and also you can get condensation and it makes your pockets heavier
D	true
C	so then they buy more food eat more food and they go etcetera
D	do people beep who have like
D	hips?
B	beep
C	yeah
B	who have what?
D	hips
A	do people who beep who have hips?
D	yes

A	he had to put it in the little box thing
B	well I always get to keep my belt on and my shoes
