B	okay what's the problem?
A	right
B	with what?
A	right you've got to compare the examples of the academic text features here yeah? with this text
B	yeah
A	and I it's
B	where does it say that?
A	really hard the
B	mm?
A	erm if you turn back to their self-study
B	yeah
A	it was erm find examples of these features in economic
B	oh really?
A	this one
B	oh I didn't do that
A	so
B	oh hang on I'd better get my book
A	it's it's their self-study thing
B	oh where's my book?
A	but erm supposed to go over it in class but there must be so many examples of it
B	no you just have
A	or
B	to take one example
A	so basically an example of complexity they could read any sentence from this
B	yeah
A	explicitness
B	oh I have got the AVU book sorry
A	well at least I can I was gonna thinking I was gonna have to go in really early
B	no
A	I don't know I thought I would be done with this fairly quickly but it's taken longer than I thought
B	right
A	like
B	er
A	see to me I'm still confused hedging an argument I would say you you put you blame it on somebody else don't you?
B	what?
A	when you hedge an argument
B	hedging is about
A	that's what it says here
B	isn't it?
A	well I always thought
B	it's about your stance
A	yeah
B	and how much you want to agree with some an argument
A	and blame it on other people?
B	well
A	okay
B	voice into that argument
A	oh
B	it's like someone else's point of view
A	yeah
B	and then you can rebut that
A	economists believe okay here's a hedge yeah so it is it is what I thought but I didn't get the definition right properly
B	yes
A	I'm on page thirteen
B	but where
A	erm in
B	exactly?
A	paragraph two so that's hedging it
B	hedging
A	but
B	yeah but with saying economists believe that's taking the power away from your answer
A	taking the power away
B	it's setting up a rebuttal really isn't it saying that?
A	it is but they've not done a rebuttal
B	well
A	have they?
B	well it depends how you're
A	okay
B	I mean if if it's in the
A	does it
B	context of economists purely economists then that's a strong statement isn't it? economists believe that's assuming that all economists believe
A	so that's
B	who thinks that
A	say that second bit again
B	mm?
A	say the second bit again
B	erm if you're assuming that you're talking about the whole world you're making a global statement
A	mm
B	then it's weakening it so
A	right okay
B	but yeah that's hedging
A	right okay so complexity well you can choose any sentence can't you?
B	well it's
A	but it's not saying that it's a complex sentence compared to a compound sentence is it? it's completely
B	yeah
A	already they have to learn the difference between a complex and compound sentence and now they're learning or this guy here says that complexity
B	well
A	a complicated sentence
B	can you see anything?
A	well any of them
B	is there any subordinate clauses?
A	oh okay then we can say it's a complex sentence
B	yeah
A	and it's a yeah but that might confuse them as well
B	well what does
A	no they have to write it not learn
B	not learn the words
A	it's in the book
B	erm more specific words and more sophisticated grammatical structures
A	well it could be any of them
B	okay well yeah
A	example of
B	could be anything
A	of for er explicitness evidence explicitness?
B	explicitness?
A	it's all
B	that's just a general thing isn't it?
A	general
B	saying it's explicit
A	well the exercise is find an example
B	explicit well maybe an example then
A	I was gonna use that as an example of precision
A	well it's in
B	yeah
A	it's all just well oh
B	okay well
A	I'm just thinking about all these questions they're gonna ask me
B	well no it's great just get them I think looking at these words fuck that I'm gonna get them to find an example of hedging
A	find an example of hedging okay I'll do that
B	and
A	is there any more examples of hedging in there?
B	I dunno but they
A	oh yeah okay right find an example of see the accuracy one too I mean it could be any of them
B	anything
A	anything
B	I'm gonna so I'm gonna skim over that responsibility?
A	you must support any ideas that make and demonstrate what they have understand to source text that they have understood the source text
B	objectivity
A	oh
B	as well could be anything
A	no
B	and it won't say
A	which is what you want
B	formality same thing
A	mm
B	yeah I think the only one
A	okay
B	er for the concrete example is hedging
A	yeah now
B	okay
A	what where are you starting this class?
B	eh?
A	where are you starting?
B	erm
B	had a quick look at it really
A	compared to this table you see but we're not
B	they're gonna write a load of stuff from there
A	oh
B	yeah
A	and then go to the AVU book?
B	exercise two
A	we're not doing these exercises until after the break
B	oh but they're reading the
A	oh
B	well I might save those questions
A	save that for later
B	I'll save the hedging bit for later and go okay now we're on to this can you remember hedging from the first one?
A	yeah
B	otherwise they're gonna end up reading the text again
A	yeah
B	and it's just gonna
A	it's silly
B	confuse the hell out of them
A	okay so can I have a look at your AVU book?
B	is that the next bit?
A	yeah
B	okay so then what is special about academic English?
A	just wanna see what kind of exercises they didn't have to do that for homework did they?
B	yeah
A	oh they did do AVU for homework then?
B	erm let me just take a quick look yes so
A	you've got the answers
B	yeah they're easy
A	oh are they? I'm gonna have to go in early and just check things over cos I've forgotten my book this is the problem with working from home I forget things and leave them at work
B	well just keep all your stuff in your bag
A	yeah I didn't have the AVU book I but
B	erm
A	but they should have read that for homework
B	yeah but we've got gotta go through it for twenty minutes
A	reviews A B and C oh okay reviews A B and C
B	well what I was gonna get actually
A	groups of three
B	that might work
A	oh no
B	get them to explain it to each other
A	yeah
B	that's the only way to do it
A	we don't have to have a Powerpoint for this do we?
B	no there's no there's nothing
A	I just need to jot this down on
B	yeah so yeah do that for twenty minutes go through the answers
A	microteaching
B	mm
A	yeah no they can
B	they can check just
A	does this
B	check each other's work
A	correspondent A and number one?
B	er don't know
A	everyday words
B	I think so yeah
A	one point two
B	yeah it's about words which are used generally and then the same type of the word is used
B	academically
A	oh my god I remember this I'm sure I've got a type out of this
B	yeah
A	ah
B	but if they've done it for homework it's gonna like oh twenty minutes of boredom
A	okay
B	shall we move on?
A	erm
B	so we're using three different books tomorrow
A	yeah
B	this making connections is bloody shit
A	yeah
B	isn't it? but you wait till you get to this bit
A	oh man
B	to acquire what? vocabulary?
A	yeah
B	okay I was just gonna brainstorm ideas make a vocabulary notebook put up a model example on the board
A	the one from the listening and speaking exercise?
B	no I'm just gonna make my own up just draw it on the board and then write the word in context
A	mm
B	mm
A	academic
B	and what else?
A	vocabulary
B	tell them as well to
A	mm
B	like lexical sets instead of just lists
A	mm
B	things like that and not to try and learn big groups of words like seven words at a time is is a good chunk
A	mm
B	anyway and then once they and don't just write them in their books cos this is what they do they do write them in their book and then forget about it
A	yeah
B	what they've got to do is write it in their book and then try and use it in everyday language
A	yeah
B	so they give themselves a challenge to to try and use those like words like during the course of the day
A	what academically? what
B	well
A	while they're discussing homework and stuff?
B	I think this is the way to
A	yeah
B	learn vocabulary and then and then use it the next week and then use it again within the next two weeks then with them the next month and then that's the only way to get it to stick
A	yeah
B	they forget them so some strategies like that
A	yeah I might start the class with that a big brainstorm
B	yeah
A	okay
B	erm don't know
A	oh
B	uhu
A	yeah answers are in the back
B	okay
A	okay so I'll get somebody to
B	so you're gonna get someone to explain that
A	mm
B	and then they and then they can check their answers for that
A	I'm not sure they
B	and then do that with that
A	correspondent perfectly
B	oh I don't they?
A	do you think?
B	I dunno maybe treat it separately then
A	yeah
B	okay next
A	these more formal
B	yeah so you could get them
A	yeah
B	to do one at a time
A	yeah
B	explain it and then check the answers
A	yeah
B	and then yeah okay right come on then
A	alright er have that erm making connections
B	okay you have to go to page two three nine
A	yeah
B	so this is about reading
A	yeah
B	every time you read trying to understand the words you don't know through the context
A	yeah
B	yeah? erm so
A	the and they've done this for homework?
B	yeah they've done the whole class for homework
A	mm
B	we're just checking their homework erm
A	okay
B	so just got to practice one or two just personal opinions so
A	you got answers?
B	this is personal opinion
A	oh
B	they just choose what's most suitable for them
A	alright
B	no not one and two but three
A	erm
B	and four we do
A	ah
B	the context
A	yes
B	without looking at the dictionary
A	okay
B	and do that with their words
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	so we're just discussing
A	in pairs what they thought the word meant?
B	is that the same thing?
A	er
B	it's the same activity but just based on a different reading
A	use these strategies for
B	yeah
A	okay
B	so three and four are the same
A	so are you going through that in class?
B	eh?
A	discuss
B	yeah
A	done it and then translated it
B	I bet they just looked at it in the dictionary
A	so what are you gonna do with them if they've done that?
B	I dunno I wish I hadn't said to do it for homework
A	mm me too
B	it's stupid isn't it?
A	well no the readings they have to do
B	oh some of them they're the I mean this could have easily
A	mm
B	okay so then it's break yeah?
A	oh but I I don't know how I'm gonna do this
B	make it up
A	get them just to just to discuss it discuss the answers to the homework
B	yeah crap eh? and then after the break more online resources introduce students to online dictionaries and thesauruses
A	we did that already
B	yeah and who uses online dictionaries these days?
A	I do
A	mm
B	so
A	Onelook dot com? never seen that
B	no
A	okay
B	so I don't know what I'm gonna do at that probably just skip over it
A	uhu
B	yeah but have you seen it?
A	one point three no let me see they've got to do this vocabulary thing yeah?
B	I tell you what it's an awful lesson for them
A	I'm gonna brainstorm malaria
B	brainstorm on the board yeah?
A	yeah
B	uhu
A	brainstorm on the board erm
B	yeah
A	maybe I'll take loads of pens and they can just in their groups on their tables
B	yeah
A	there's three tables they can write as many as they can
B	yeah and then bring it together in the class
A	er maybe get some large sheets of paper
B	ah got time for that
A	read aloud you didn't do?
B	well yeah just to well for the time we're so short of time
A	uhu
B	erm
A	yeah I know they say that this course is packed but actually if you did it if you do it efficiently it's not
A	it depends on their understanding I suppose
B	okay so they've gotta try and determine what the words mean that they don't know
A	okay so that's what they did in
B	yeah
A	same as AVU
B	same thing
A	but they do it in class
B	erm and then maybe if okay we so we've oh here it is exercise three so four of the unknown words they have to write it down
A	well they're keen at the moment aren't they? so they're they're jumping ahead a lot
B	I should never have said
A	they haven't done this er
B	to do this
A	they haven't done this for homework
B	I told them to
A	you did? it wasn't on the homework list
B	wasn't it?
A	no it er exercise one was
B	really?
A	mm
B	oh okay thank god for that
A	but I bet because they did exercise one that they've read all of this
B	yeah I bet they have
A	because they
B	they've got free time at the moment and they're keen
A	yeah they're just too keen
B	erm
A	okay?
B	okay
A	thirteen fourteen
B	yeah
A	exercise four
B	yeah this is where it starts getting messy
A	mm er oh I've forgotten to
B	subject specific vocabulary okay it's to do with health anything to do with health
A	yeah subject er specific is fine
A	it's like general academic vocabulary
A	mm
B	so you
A	mm
B	but
A	but there's no answers?
B	no
A	nothing?
B	no
A	okay let me
B	but I I got
A	get a red pen general academic vocabulary
B	it's I
A	mm
B	shown
A	are you just doing shown?
B	well shown is
A	yeah
B	it's kind of a metaphor in this
A	constraint?
B	oh okay
B	oh so you're doing that? right I was thinking of words which have two different meanings
A	oh
B	I was I was thinking in a different way so you're just talking okay just
A	yeah
B	right
A	affects
B	yeah oh okay in that case it's not a problem
A	hang on I'm going to write lots
B	leads to?
A	annual
B	yeah this one yeah?
A	what?
B	leads to
A	where? where are you?
B	er in the second paragraph fourth line
A	uhu yeah
B	yeah
A	am I circling
B	but
A	this? or?
B	you're putting a big fucking exclamation mark next to it because
A	oh oh yes
A	oh my god
A	I'm sure we've
B	yeah lead tos
A	so you're doing spot the mistake?
B	which
A	or
B	phrasal verbs are just
A	I think it's
B	lead to mm
A	what would you say instead? really? give us an alternative to leads to
B	okay this penalty
A	isn't that a phrasal verb?
A	a consequence of this is okay
B	that's not necessarily a consequence though is it? leads to
B	forget that
A	well yeah but when you've got a native speaker in your class she's gonna ask me questions like this
A	just say the problem is with this one say lead to look
A	it's a bad example
B	it's a bad example
A	and I think it's okay
B	phrase most phrasal verbs yeah you shouldn't be using them in academic writing but leads to is debatable
A	and if they ask for an alternative? mm
B	the result
A	the result of
B	of
A	this penalty is
B	yeah
A	the result is okay right so
B	right erm
A	I'm just circling some more academic vocabulary
B	er costs?
A	mm
B	or is that
A	mm
B	so what kind of costs is that?
A	yeah
B	well
A	a combination of expenditures
B	erm accounts?
A	support for
B	account for?
A	account for yeah
B	at the bottom second line up where's support for?
A	support for third paragraph fourth line
B	yeah
A	oh okay
B	I'm not gonna confuse them with this
A	no right so they're just doing general academic vocabulary subject specific
B	mm
A	vocabulary fine
B	so that won't take very long will it?
A	no how long was that?
B	go online
A	my timings are all over the place you know? I'm not
B	yeah so when they've
A	so
B	these four words that they've got they've basically gotta go er
A	ten minutes?
B	okay
A	okay yeah
B	go on the dictionary
A	but when though?
B	find out the exact words
A	oh for your list oh yes I remember
B	so don't use a dictionary
A	yeah
B	again
A	once you know the exact meaning of the words write a sentence using a different form of the word
B	yeah
A	use four general academic words
B	mm okay that'll take what? ten minutes?
A	use a different form of the word well what if their word was malaria?
B	yeah that's that's why I said
A	what if they changed the form like
B	I'd say you can change no what's the point of changing the form?
B	mm
A	really? so
B	use a different form of the word if possible
A	disease
B	but then they might
A	I thought they were choosing just any vocabulary that they don't understand
B	no these are four general academic vocabulary words
A	oh I thought it they were looking at this list
B	eh?
A	any four unknown words
B	oh
A	oh
B	then
A	check
B	they look at the dictionary for the real meaning
A	right
B	yeah
A	use four general
B	yeah it doesn't
A	it's a bit
B	make sense
A	backwards isn't it?
B	it doesn't it's badly written
A	I suppose if they choose any general
B	okay so say they choose accounts
A	accountable
B	the disease may account for okay so they look up account a financial thing so
A	well they should be looking at the context anyway
B	anyway that's the best one
A	mm
B	right?
A	I've got a feeling that I had trouble with this last year and there's something written in by the book
B	I think it's gonna be you're gonna have to really kind of
A	oh is that it?
B	stretch it out yeah
A	you'll be expected to work through the academic
B	yeah
A	mm
B	tomorrow
A	that doesn't look right though
B	no
A	okay
B	I'll put the kettle on
A	we're just having pasta yeah because I've can't yeah
B	well quick easy
A	yeah quick and easy
B	we've finished our House of Cards haven't we?
A	no we're on series two
B	oh
A	can't believe it was such a long time ago that we watched it I need more board pens for tomorrow have you got any?
B	yeah I've got loads
A	yeah can I have a couple?
B	er
A	oh my foot's gone all tingly I need
B	do you need a black one and a red one?
A	oh lovely yeah
B	oh
A	there you go
B	that took a long time didn't it?
A	I know
B	got to stop talking about work so much
A	I know I know well no I've got to stop
A	bringing it home I need to just plan at work
B	yeah why are you not just
A	but I don't know what I'm doing why I'm doing this
B	cos I'm planning it at work in like twenty minutes
A	well I'm coming home to feed her
B	yeah
A	and it's messing up my times
B	yeah
A	I'm coming home and feeding her at lunch and then I don't know then people are talking
B	yeah
A	erm
B	well I suppose it's good in a way cos we can do this
A	yeah
B	you know? it's quite a easy thing to record isn't it? boring for whoever's listening to it but
A	yeah a bit boring I'm gonna take this thing off my toenail
B	you don't have to spend the whole day trying to entertain people
A	it's
B	it'll be our payback
A	payback? what a boring
A	talking about our classes
B	yeah
A	mm
B	right so
A	that doesn't mean to say I'm not worried about this class and doing it
B	don't worry about it
A	eh?
B	it's what it is everyone's teaching the same thing
A	yeah
B	yes
A	oh take it away from
A	my brain
B	you might change your
A	for
B	cos this Youtube's just not working at all
A	yeah I know
B	but I can download one in about half an hour
A	for
B	no
A	what
B	no
A	no?
B	I'm trying to download these tutorials
A	oh probably better off paying for the course then
B	yeah?
A	might be better off paying for the course
B	no but they're
A	oh no
B	no about fourteen pounds each these little courses and there's about ten of them
A	yeah
B	or I can go on Youtube and this guy's got fifty videos of basically the same thing
A	yeah but if you can't watch them
B	no but I can download them and then that would be better cos then I can watch them any time
A	which programme are you using?
B	erm Keepvid
A	I think that's the one I used for
B	there's Savevid Keepvid there's loads but some of them are kind of they try and get you to download their own software but this one was
A	I downloaded some software and it didn't work
B	well then they scammed you that's probably some malware or something
A	no it's a good one it's a good one
B	yeah?
A	but it doesn't
B	well this one you don't have to
B	yeah and it doesn't work
A	but it doesn't work
B	everyone must be right then
A	I don't think it works with my Windows that
A	stupid Windows thing that I've got
B	well Keepvid works so use that you don't need to download anything you just type put in the URL
A	uhu
B	and then click on the
A	yeah oh I don't know
B	erm what resolution you want
A	I I downloaded all those videos for
B	mm
A	all those erm songs
B	well gonna watch House of Cards again aren't we?
A	don't have to
B	yeah no no I love it

A	oh the peppers need cooking shall I just chop them really small and we'll have crunchy ones
B	are they washed?
A	yeah it was washed before
B	yeah that'll be alright it'll give it a bit of texture won't it?
A	yeah
B	do you wanna use the chilli oil?
A	or just a little bit
B	cos we haven't got any onions so it'll give it a bit of a crunch
A	yeah
B	no
A	I notice I'm doing all the chopping here
B	I'm supervising and
A	yeah?
B	doing a good job with that
A	I know I I like them quite small it reminds me of working at
B	really?
A	just eat salad yeah
B	that's good it's like is that five star?

B	yeah
A	the golf club
B	yeah
A	it is a really expensive place
B	yeah well
A	really expensive
B	mm
A	like you'd never be able to stay there
B	no
A	when we had our wedding party it wasn't on the list of places to stay
B	yeah
A	it's the closest hotel but
B	not the closest
A	it's not closer
A	anyway
A	we've walked to
B	no?
A	no
B	well only
A	it's crazy
B	cos of the road
B	what's
A	oh I've ended up just dropping the whole thing look
B	I still haven't seen any of these motherfuckers
A	I know too many
B	they're really stealthy
A	I hope
B	yeah
A	just before dinner
B	which episode are we on? number two of the second series?
A	yeah
B	yeah well I can't wait for the third series now
A	no hang on
B	yeah he just pushed her in front of a train
A	you just ruined it you've ruined the plot oh no
A	yeah but
B	everyone's seen it
A	was that the first
B	that was the first
A	was that the first
B	episode of the second series
A	cos it's a funny place to put something like that cos usually you
B	yeah
A	put something like that
B	no
A	like at the end
B	it was great it makes it even better
A	and it wasn't even at the end of the episode was it?
B	no
A	it was like in the middle
B	yeah it was great
A	you don't usually have things like that
B	it's the best thing I think I've that series is the best I've ever watched
B	in terms of
A	uhu
B	mm I mean you know David Lynch
A	mm
B	but
B	it's the
A	yeah
B	like series
B	whatever team of writers did that they deserve a
A	oh no they're brilliant aren't they?
B	Oscar or something
A	I don't
B	and
A	get how they
B	and they they should erm teach it at school like to politics students or
A	they must have they must be politicians the people who wrote it
B	yeah
A	yeah? alright
B	no they don't have to be politicians I don't I in fact I'd say they're definitely not politicians
A	really? I'd say they were like they knew every how it all works and everything
B	oh
A	they need to they need to
B	yeah an understanding of politics but
A	mm
B	but to almost expose it
A	yeah they
B	exposé really
A	it's an old yeah
B	what
A	the
B	bloody sociopaths these people are
A	yeah
B	and how it does work
A	but some of the stuff
B	and how it isn't a conspiracy and and things do link up
A	I'd say
B	manipulative
A	somebody
B	these people are and
A	would have worked in that
B	the lobbyists and
A	whoever wrote it they must have seen all of that
B	mm
A	who did write it?
B	well that was the
A	see we haven't seen that one with
B	no
A	was it?
B	yeah whereas Thatcher
A	let's watch that
B	Thatcher was the like the president who was getting ousted
A	yeah
B	erm
B	erm
A	let's let's
B	seen that actually
A	watch it
B	but I think all the
B	characters' names are the same
A	really?
B	and I I think they did two series so it would be basically the same thing
A	mm that cheese is nice
B	but they're doing a first series with the American ones
A	erm
B	which I think
A	probably
B	is gonna take it a step further cos erm at the end he's getting together his little team isn't he?
A	mm yeah
B	like he's got that woman
A	he basically put everybody in there yeah
B	he's getting all of his team in place
A	can you pass that
B	so
A	do you need a cloth?
B	which is basically
B	who wrote that must know a lot about erm well Hitler as well cos I think they're basing it a lot on
A	really?
B	yeah
A	oh of course you've read his book haven't you? I haven't read it
B	I've read Mein Kampf but that doesn't say very much
A	no?
B	it's very badly written actually
A	don't splash me
B	oh
A	wear red
B	why?
A	apparently if if it's your year
B	right
A	like my year is the year of the horse
B	right
A	if it if it comes round again which is has for me
B	what the year of the horse?
A	yeah
B	what do you mean if it comes round again? it always comes round again
A	when
B	when you die you mean?
A	when it comes round again
B	what do you mean?
A	when it comes round I need to use that one when it comes round again year of the horse
B	yeah
A	then if you you have to wear red for good luck
B	what all year?
A	er if you wear red you have a lucky day
B	well yeah that sounds logical
A	I haven't even got anything red now anyway what were you saying? don't know why I turned on to the
B	I dunno you're just not interested in what I was saying
A	I am interested I'm very interested
B	no I was saying the House of Cards third season
A	oh yeah
B	yeah I reckon it's gonna go into like a nuclear war or something
A	very clever do you reckon you could write something like that?
B	no chance
A	no?
B	no well you haven't got you need insider knowledge a little bit don't you?
A	that's what I said
B	yeah yeah but
A	is this alright? can we
B	yeah
A	open a new one this looks so old
B	can I smell it?
A	but it's fine
