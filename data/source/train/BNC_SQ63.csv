A	be careful you don't fall off the back there won't you're right on the edge
B	I've got cramp
A	have you? oh right
B	and I just thought I'd er
A	alright
B	yeah
A	let me move those around
B	yeah that's it yeah
A	do you get cramp often?
B	erm er fairly frequently yeah
A	do you?
B	I think it's an engineering background my father was
A	ah
B	a civil engineer
A	right
B	and erm I studied
A	right right
B	erm ending up at their applied research laboratories at
A	right
B	and er working on just er to start with guided weapons and then on er satellite communications
A	very interesting
B	then I erm formed a company with a couple of friends and erm we sold printing equipment all over the world
[ANNOTATION]	Person B said that he formed the company and starts to sold printing tools	Entailment
A	right printing equipment?
B	yeah we actually modify we actually produce modifications for existing equipment
A	right
B	erm we'd all worked for one company who was at the time was a majorly a brand leader in the area and we produced electronics for the print industry
A	right right because erm in the in the I I worked for newspapers for quite a long time for about sixteen years I worked for the
B	I I never really used to
A	right
B	I I ran the R and B department
[ANNOTATION]	Person B has never used to and he works in rhythm and blues department	Neutral
[ANNOTATION]	Person B has never used to and he works in R and B department	Neutral
A	right right
B	and erm
A	erm right so you were research and development and erm really you're the boffin behind the the engineering not not the sales person or the
B	no occasionally we we'd
A	right
B	a particular
A	right right and how many people were there in your company?
B	er the maximum it was about thirty
[ANNOTATION]	Person B is going to dance	Contradiction
A	right
B	but most of the time it was about twelve fifteen something like that
A	right right and erm you must have seen a lot of changes with printing techniques over the years
B	erm yes erm the er I worked for
A	yes
[ANNOTATION]	Person A think that there were many changes in printing techniques	Entailment
B	and so I saw the development of the scanner from the early analogue scanners to the later digital scanners and so on
A	right
B	and then it moved to
A	yes
B	people started using small flatbeds
A	yes I remember the erm in there was a sort of like a it was like a piece of cardboard er was it called
B	oh
[ANNOTATION]	Person B is amazed by the thing that Person A said about the printing techniques	Entailment
A	was that method called? that came somewhere in the middle
A	oh you didn't well they adopted
B	it was purely
A	that method at one stage and what the the card the residue cardboard that they left behind I used to paint on I used to sort of try and
A	bend it back the other way and paint on the back
B	yes
A	but that was very interesting
B	yeah
A	I wish I hadn't got rid of some of those though they were er they might be worth something today erm but er a lot of erm these processes they're good for a while and then they just go don't they?
B	they do yes I mean the the although some of the high quality work is still done on the kind of scanners
A	yeah
B	I worked on
A	yes
B	most of it's now gone to the flatbeds which you put on your desktop
A	yes yeah in the metallic printing erm they've still got in
B	yes
A	a lot of the time and they put
B	yeah
A	you see it
B	er yes I tend to build things in parallel because I like
A	right
B	to be able to swap between different scales and
A	yeah
B	different sizes
A	oh right
B	and so I'm building a two and a half inch gauge model of one of the American er wartime austerity locomotives
A	oh right
B	a five inch gauge Manning Wardle
A	oh right
B	and a seven and a quarter inch gauge Hunslet
A	not much then
B	no no just just enough to keep me happy
B	erm it obviously varies but er erm I quite often spend the whole day in the workshop
A	do you?
B	cos it's
A	yeah yeah and do you find that if you don't get your model engineering done it
B	not particularly no but I I do
B	if you don't er
A	it yes erm I notice erm obviously cos I live with
B	I think probably we
A	yeah yeah
B	but er
A	and I'm the same with my art if I've got to if I'm diverted by doing housework or things that I really don't want to do I I do get grumpy
B	yes
A	and I need to get erm I do I actually get very temperamental altogether so I've just got to get in there and do it you you see so you've been coming on these working parties now for how long?
B	virtually since I joined the clubs
A	really?
B	about five years
A	five years? yeah yeah
B	one one time there were only three of us who normally turned up
A	right
B	erm
A	right
B	and so erm I also edit the magazine so I'm dubbed as the three musketeers
A	oh right
B	er er how did it work out?
A	and
B	yes
A	yes I like it erm cos
B	he did yeah
A	and now you're doing it
B	yes I do it
A	so I was I was going to I know that I'm too late for this edition er but I want to put a little thank you in
B	yeah
A	and also at the same time put something in to ask if there are any other members who would like to talk at some time when I come back
B	mm yes
A	so erm so how are you finding the challenge of doing
B	oh it's interesting yes
A	yeah
B	I quite enjoy it yes
A	you do? yeah
B	yes I think it I think it's getting to the point having done it for now about three or four years I that it's er time that I
A	oh
B	hand it over to somebody else
A	oh right
B	for them to er
A	oh so now you've been doing it for three or four years and then
B	he he was yes
A	he was yes so I'm right out of date because
B	mm
A	isn't it funny how the years go on and you still think oh it's still think it's
B	mm
A	dreadful so you you how much time does that take up?
B	erm it takes up most of a week basically
A	does it?
B	to put each er
A	yeah
B	each edition together
B	erm
A	that's a big contribution as a volunteer isn't it really?
B	er yes it is er
A	but it's your hobby as well
B	it that's right it is
A	yeah yeah but erm have you ever thought of having a woman's page in
B	erm I've never had a contributor
A	anything new
B	yeah
A	I was actually thinking about this erm show you're planning next year and erm thinking of having
B	yes
B	well we do have contributions from the various sections
A	yeah yeah
B	of the at the
A	yeah
B	erm occasionally from the
A	yes
B	so yes it was no real reason why there shouldn't be a section
A	no I
A	do you?
A	yeah so erm erm when you were doing your job originally looking back at the beginning of your career after you left university erm did you did you sort of fall into that erm way of working or did or was it something that you really wanted to do?
B	oh no I I knew I wanted to go into design and development
A	right
B	into R and D right from the start
A	yeah yeah
B	and erm say I although I've erm I er well
A	right
B	as a director
A	right
B	but erm I was always involved the technical side yes
A	right what would you say over the years was the most satisfying project you worked on?
B	oh that's difficult erm
A	or one of them you know
B	erm well in some respects the the well when we were working when we were er became independent erm we erm produced an interface between the established erm graphic art scanners
A	right
B	er and the desktop
A	right
B	and we were virtually the first people in the world to do this so we
A	right
B	erm one year
A	that was an achievement yes
B	yeah one year we exported ninety-two percent of our product
A	really?
B	and we got a Queen's Award for Industry for it
A	my goodness
B	erm so it was that was perhaps the most in some respects the most interesting
A	yeah erm erm
B	and so
A	where were where did you export it?
B	erm we a lot went er to the States
A	right
B	erm one of the directors was married to a Japanese lady
A	oh right
B	and we exported quite a lot to Japan
A	yes
B	erm and in and the rest of Europe in general
A	right
B	we had quite an active agent in Germany
A	right
B	and erm so virtually the whole of the world
A	the but it because you were more er you were obviously research and development did you you did get sometimes obviously a chance to go to these places did you? or or travel at all?
B	er yes in erm er my wife had a a horse and we had a horse box
A	oh right
B	so the my company car was a erm a Discovery
A	right
B	and that was used to tow the company's trailer whenever we went to a show
A	right
B	and so I often ended up driving the thing down the autobahns to Dusseldorf or somewhere
A	oh right oh I see
B	loaded with er
A	oh right
B	all sorts of bits and pieces for the show
A	yeah yeah they're very fast those autobahns aren't they? well erm we lived in Germany for a while and erm I think it was before we really had very many motorways er it was nineteen
B	yeah
A	and erm in those days I remember travelling on the autobahn and thinking well was it in nineteen fifty or? I went back to Germany in erm nineteen sixty-seven as well so it could have been nineteen sixty-seven but they
B	yes I no I just took them
A	you just er
B	with three tonnes behind and a Land Rover
A	yeah
B	you're not gonna go very quickly anyway
A	no no and so when you were there and
B	yes
A	yeah yeah
B	in fact the idea for the interface really we we first put out at a a show just to sort of see what the kind of response would be
A	yeah
B	and erm we got people from all sorts of parts of
A	right
B	coming from other companies saying
A	right
B	this would be interesting so that was really what er pushed us into doing it
A	absolutely I mean I've been to with
B	yeah
A	and it took so long to get there and I used to find I'd get there and find he was deep in conversation with a potential customer and which I of course wouldn't wouldn't even wink at him you know
B	mm
A	erm and then I'd have to find all my way back
A	so erm it was a bit of a shame really and erm you know there you go but erm and that's over now and that twenty years of that erm yes it's it's over he was there a lot longer so erm did you meet your wife at work? or
B	yes I did yes
A	you did?
B	yes
A	oh right
B	erm I got a er call from one of the other secretaries saying that erm I knew her vaguely but not very well
A	yes
B	and er saying that she'd broken down
A	right
B	and erm since I was er interested in cars then I got er it
A	yes
B	and er so suggested we went out and rescued her so
B	two of us went out
A	yes
B	and er we
A	oh right oh that's a very nice story
A	yeah that's a very nice story erm so erm do you have any other hobbies mm er besides engineering? I
B	erm I although I haven't sailed much recently I
A	ah
B	sail erm I erm restore historic cars as well
A	oh right okay
B	erm again it's probably
A	yes
B	erm
A	what historic car have you got at the moment?
B	erm I've got a Healey Silverstone which is
A	oh have you?
B	the
A	oh wow
B	and erm I've got the I built the last ever kit TVR
A	right
B	and I've still got that as well
A	right oh right
B	so that's two of them though
A	yeah that's erm er and and do you go to shows with them at all or?
B	erm I I haven't done recently
A	no
B	but I have done occasionally in the past yes
A	it's quite nice isn't it in the summer? you
B	yes my I infected my son and erm
A	oh right
B	he owns a TVR and we took one on a rally in Spain
A	oh right
B	a couple of years ago which was
A	yes
B	quite fun
A	oh right goodness erm I I think erm I I used to know someone with a TVR years ago he lived over in
B	uhu
A	and I was saying this morning to erm
B	yeah
A	back for a while but I've got my fur coat and my MG
B	yes why not?
A	and erm you know there there you are
A	I think you you've got to do that erm it's very important so erm have you had a holiday this year? or
B	erm no
A	ah
B	but erm we I we normally go skiing in the winter
A	oh do you?
B	er so
A	oh right

A	oh right
B	so we're going
A	very nice
B	yes
A	we we're going to
