A	yeah so that's
E	yeah

D	oh really?

A	pretty harmless
D	yeah
A	damn it

F	mm
B	probably not the best decision you made all day
F	mm you'll be fine
B	been fighting it all day haven't we?
C	yeah been to B and Q three times
E	oh
E	going once is bad enough
B	it's not a fun way to spend your Saturday is it?
C	no
B	in B and Q
D	are you still doing lots of work on the
B	no it's not too bad now is it?
C	we're nearly there now
D	yeah?
B	it does look good
C	just little tweaks now like plumbing leaks
[ANNOTATION]	They have a lot more to go on	Contradiction
D	uhu
B	leaks?
F	it'll be fine
B	it's good now isn't it?
C	yeah
B	there's nothing big to do
C	yeah
A	great as long as it's warm and dry
C	got
B	it is dry yeah
[ANNOTATION]	It's dry because it's 40 degrees	Neutral
C	got two toilets now
F	get you with your two
C	mm I know
A	got two toilets?
[ANNOTATION]	They got 4 toilets	Contradiction
F	you're a two toilet family
F	that is fancy though
E	that's like
A	did you forget about the little toilet at the end of the kitchen?
F	yeah cos it was always so full of junk that if you ever wanted to
F	use it you had to contort yourself
C	you had to empty it
A	it was always quite damp as well wasn't it? I remember being you know like when you're really desperate and it's like oh I'm gonna have to use like the the crap cupboard toilet
E	it was it was
C	oh no
E	converted to a wet room at one stage
A	was it?
[ANNOTATION]	When someone wanted to use it was very full of garbage	Entailment
E	where there's a drain in the floor
C	oh
A	oh
F	it would have been really cold and uncomfortable having a shower in there
E	yeah
A	and really cramped as well hardly a wet room wet cupboard
F	wet cupboard
[ANNOTATION]	It wasn't pleasant to take a bath in that room	Entailment
E	yeah
F	it wasn't it wasn't great I mean it did do in emergency use only didn't it? but it wasn't
A	yeah
F	it wouldn't be first choice for comfort
A	it was yeah if you
F	and lovely surroundings
[ANNOTATION]	It is used only for very special and emergency situations	Entailment
A	if you really can't wait for the nice bathroom
F	to be honest you'd have been better off just heading down the garden wouldn't you?
F	to the wilderness at the end and keeping
A	uhu
A	yeah
F	bits and pieces in
A	mm
D	mm
F	and then if you have to needed to use it
A	did it have a did it even have a sink?
F	no you had to come out and wash your hands in the kitchen sink
A	that's a bit like the bathroom in our house except that's our only toilet
D	mm
F	and there's loads of you in your house
A	I know
E	yes it it did not meet modern building standard requirements in that
F	cos you aren't meant to have two doors aren't you between
E	yeah
F	the toilet and the kitchen?
C	how many do you share with then?
E	mm
A	three of us so it's a house of five which isn't bad it was worse when we erm we lived with
C	yeah
A	and that was like sometimes getting in the bathroom was really hard but because we're on quite different routines
C	yeah
A	like everyone starts their working day at different times and like a couple of days of the week me and
F	mm
A	so far it's been alright
F	at least your toilet's separate to the bathroom so
A	exactly so someone having a shower won't stop you going in and having a wee if you need to
F	yeah
A	which is the worst have you finished having your luxurious bath yet?
F	mm
C	we only have to wait when
B	yeah
B	we tell her the shower leaks as well so she won't be long
C	yeah
B	so you can't be long cos the shower leaks
C	yeah we were
C	it's cos we had a new shower and it
C	so we just tell her it oh still leaking so she's really quick
C	with her shower
F	that's a really good idea
A	you keep that going as long as possible
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	like why don't you get it fixed?
C	oh it's still leaking you
C	yeah
D	quite good that's a good plan
C	it is a fantastic shower though it's like a rain forest it's got massive air
A	oh
C	oh it's lovely
A	that's really nice a good shower
C	yeah
A	a powerful shower
C	yeah
A	yeah yeah
C	that was what it was it like shoved on the
F	yeah I remember them
C	as a shower
A	uhu
C	and it you had to like
F	those ones that you shove on the taps
C	move round just to get the
F	they just pop off don't they?
A	yeah they just pop off
C	yeah
F	it would just suddenly go bonk
A	I remember those cos they were always at nanny's house and they had like a rubber seal that was quite perished like
C	yeah
F	yeah
A	the rubber bits were
F	so you'd either get freezing cold or
C	that's the one
F	boiling hot
A	yeah
A	yeah
C	oh
A	but I think it's kind of instilled in my the the bath shower mentality
C	yeah
A	so I kind of always have a bit of both I have a bit of a bath and then I shower my hair and rinse my hair and then sit in the bath for a bit longer
A	and it's like that's how you do it
A	even though like you can just have a shower or have a bath but no a bath shower bath
F	you're a creature of habit
F	once you've been programmed it's hard to shift you
C	thank you
D	mm
B	our bathroom's good in the morning it's just
A	thank you
B	boiling hot isn't it?
C	it is yeah
B	put the shower on and it's
C	steamy
B	and you don't wanna go out the bathroom cos it's cold everywhere else
A	yeah
B	no
A	when you've got a good no?
B	no
A	no
B	no no
A	not good enough?
B	no no
B	boom and it's hot
F	sorry?
C	we've thought of everything
F	I hate being made to do things it's in the bin alright?
C	bang
F	there
C	there
F	binned it
B	Captain Sensible wouldn't put up with that sort of stuff
F	oh don't start that
F	I had this very very vivid dream where
F	Captain Sensible of the nineteen eighties beret wearing Happy Talk hit one-hit-wonder
C	keep talking
F	but it was somebody
C	not actually him?
F	but it was somebody that I got I never even saw their face
F	but they were bald and I was like I'd never go out with a
F	bald man
F	and everyone called him Captain Sensible cos he was quite boring right? and in my dream I spent ages with him he had me like that sniffing the crook of his arm and he was saying I've never had body odour in my life smell that and I was like no you're right it doesn't smell of anything but I did not wanna run off with him
F	despite his lack of smelly arm
F	and
F	is a wedding ring the other one's his grandad's ring that he gave and I said
F	he's gonna want that back
F	and he was like he'd hired these heavies these there was all these men came in to make me pack and go and you've got like
F	so many minutes to pack your bags and go and I'm like haven't got anywhere to go
F	oh and it was really sad and I woke up really upset didn't I?
B	we've
E	yes
B	we've got two bathrooms so you come to us
C	yes
A	and live in one of the bathrooms
C	you have have to wait for the toilet
F	two toilets and a big showerhead
F	it's tempting
A	very tempting
F	and neither of you are bald so
F	I would go for that option
C	and as far as we know there's no
A	no body odour
C	issues
C	so
A	that's why you get it
B	yeah I'm right right in there
F	you see Captain Sensible said to me it'll be alright we can just stay in a hotel until we find so we obviously had money
C	mm
F	but I didn't wanna go off with him
B	well that's probably what it was isn't it?
C	he was sensible then
A	cos he'd probably saved very sensibly
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	and invested wisely
B	put it in an Isa
A	yeah
F	sensible
A	a Captain Sensible's Isa yeah
B	opened his pension money
F	you were right narky and you'd posted a Youtube video about how horrible I was
A	that's when I ask mum if
A	dumping his fiancée
F	oh yeah
A	and she hadn't
F	mm
A	we were like obviously that kind of thing happens
F	mm
A	and people make a Youtube video about going this person's cheated on me and here's me like
F	confronting them
A	confronting them and then put it online for the world to see
F	stupid
B	that's just weird isn't it?
A	yeah
F	and I was saying
A	it's just the kind of thing you'd do
F	even a bit of advice from
F	is this relaying that you know how I felt when I got that first email and I was like what email? I haven't sent you anything
F	and I woke up really genuinely upset
C	out
C	get out
F	out
A	get the heavies round and
F	mm made me pack my bag
A	forcibly evicted from your own home
F	mm it's really cheeky
A	bit cheeky yeah a bit cheeky
F	I mean what what the hell was that all about? where did that come from?
A	don't know what sparked that off
F	I have not got a bald sugar daddy I'm too old to have a sugar daddy now anyway
F	a sugar grandad
F	it would have to be sugar grandaddy
F	and he would be bald I suppose
C	mm
F	probably wouldn't have any teeth either
F	probably doesn't have a smell cos he's so desecrated
C	Complan
F	Vicks
A	Vicks
F	vapour rub
B	and cat piss
C	ah
F	oh I'll stay with my beardy wonder
A	now he's got
F	he has got a lot of hair and that's I like that in a man
C	yeah I like lots of hair as well
F	yeah
B	I've got a complex now I have
F	well
B	and the smell as well actually
F	well you've had a
B	or I'm gonna go grey

C	slightly cabbagey
F	yeah you'd go

F	this has been

F	this has been at a funny angle on the parkland at some stage I'm guessing
F	and mired in the mud
C	it died the other day and you had to have a courtesy car and
A	that's a big difference isn't it?
B	I took it to the garage er he he drove it down he said well I told him what was going on and I said I'll drive it down the road drove it down the road came back with a big grin on his face put it up on the ramp said you can't drive that

E	ruined the whole evening's ruined
F	oh honey cake better be good otherwise
E	no
A	why is the cake sloppy dad?
F	the cake's way too sloppy
C	I'm not sure sloppy cakes are good
F	well I had to stop the kids eating sloppy cake last night
A	you can't stop kids
C	why did the cake get sloppy?
F	well they wanted to eat the cake mix because
C	oh
F	at
E	I don't know it's my own recipe and I've never made it before so it might taste like shit
D	is there a vegetarian one of those ones?
E	they're vegetarian they're in the the the fishy pie I made
D	oh okay
E	no just help just help yourself
D	yeah
F	I can
C	yeah
F	fill up a water jug and make them glasses of squash but there's nowhere to wash up there's some tiny little hand basins in the toilets but you wouldn't wanna wash up in those they
C	no
C	yeah
F	but it's got like the so I took that and some bowls and a mixer and some cake mix so they could whizz it up and we'd just cook it on a table but of course they're all like can I just eat this? er
F	and I'm like I'm like well it has got raw egg in it I said so you have to make an informed
A	oh it's all fine
F	so I had to tell them that but kids being
A	no
F	I've got no way of washing up so if you lick it everyone's got to have that same spoon
F	so don't lick it
B	no it's alright it's very
E	mm?
B	it's very good
E	oh is it? oh good
B	yeah
E	thank you
A	I was wondering what the vegetable would taste like cos the fish one's amazing
B	mm
F	oh cos you get so worried
A	really good flavour
C	I can't get near it
E	it is hot on the server plate
C	mm
F	it is
A	it's yummy
C	that's good
A	it's got all the flavour
D	mm
C	it is brilliant
F	so I'm not sure I'm not I'll have to look it up
B	yeah
F	cos I'm not sure what the actual rules I mean I've done my food hygiene course
C	mm
F	I've done the very basic one to get the hygiene certificate so I can do cookery with the kids at well but I'm not quite sure what what are the rules on raw eggs? should you avoid it with kids when? cos I
E	mm
F	then I thought I'd better not just in case one of them does get poorly afterwards and the parents kick off and they say you shouldn't have let them be in even if it wasn't that that made them poorly
A	uhu
F	do you know what I mean?
E	uhu I do believe there're separate rules
F	and then the kids say oh well I ate some cake mix
A	yeah
C	I don't know
E	I think there are more stringent rules for children's food than there is
F	well I thought I'd just
E	adults
F	err on the side of caution so I gave it to my co-worker to
C	well
F	rinse out in the hand basin especially cos they couldn't and they were like
A	but
F	oh we were gonna eat that
A	yeah yeah
F	I'm really sorry kids but
A	well when I reading a Slimming World recipe the other day for panna cotta so
F	oh are you doing Slimming World?
A	oh yeah
F	you should have said
A	erm but erm
F	yeah
A	I was reading a recipe I think for panna cottas and it involved raw egg whites
F	mm
A	and just at the end it said like the elderly pregnant women and babies shouldn't eat raw egg
F	right
A	and it didn't say children it said babies
F	I mean I would get if it was down to me I would let kids eat cos I let you eat
A	you let me eat it and I was strapping
F	and you can still have raw egg
F	you know I do
F	I like a runny yoke in my boiled egg or
A	uhu
F	fried egg and slightly soft scrambled eggs
A	uhu
F	I was just thinking if any of the parents
A	yeah
F	you know even if it wasn't related when the kids and they're like oh what did you have to eat at
F	I don't know I was just thinking about covering my own back
A	well no no I completely understand that
F	so they did kick off a little bit but I said oh you've only had about fifty little cakes each you poor things
F	you haven't got to lick some old cake mix off a bowl
C	that is a happy memory from childhood though isn't it?
E	uhu
C	licking the cake mix
F	mm they did all want it
B	mm
E	mm
F	and I was quite like right we're gonna bin it
A	no it's good it's better to err on the side of
E	caution
A	caution when they're not your kids
C	never did us any harm
F	no it's er it's just one of those things they all know
E	does anyone want any
D	uhu
F	but everyone likes broccoli
D	I will have some broccoli
C	the fish pie is amazing
F	mm
A	mm
E	thank you
F	this was
A	mm

F	is there any particular meal you'd like for Saturday as your pre birthday meal? and she requested daddy's fishy pie
C	mm it's gorgeous
F	so that's why so once we had a vegetarian
E	mm
D	I like the vegetarian one
F	but with vegetables instead it's exactly the same
A	leek leek pie leeky mushroom pie
D	uhu
E	mm
A	no it is one of those things that I love and that I can't be bothered to make for myself and I think of fondly from my dad's cooking so whenever
A	I get to request a meal I I like request something that falls into all those categories
F	mm
C	something you can't be arsed to cook yourself

D	exactly
A	like I know dad does a good one of these
E	I'll make dad do it

A	could you pop that back in the fridge please
D	yes
F	hang on
F	not so fast
F	nicotine
D	yeah
A	my my brain just cycled through all the options and thought that sounds like some sort of seventies slogan like
F	yes it was
A	listen to Charlie
F	it was the say no to smoking thing and you had to go not so fast nicotine
D	I probably heard that all the time
D	as I was
F	blanked it out not so fast nicotine
B	those were the days chocolate was good for you
F	yeah
B	cos it had a glass and a half of milk in it in every bar
B	that was the slogan yeah
F	that's fine get it down you
A	great
B	it was good for you yes a glass and a half of milk
F	and we used to be able to buy sweet cigarettes you know
B	mm
F	the the ones that were like white with the the red glowing bit at the end
B	uhu
F	so you'd pretend to smoke and there were the chocolate ones with like a paper wrapper
B	mm
A	mm
F	so smoking was very in
A	smoking good
F	smoking cool
A	how were sweets good for you?
F	they just were
F	he did say that well that's what his mate said you never really knew what Charlie said cos he just went
F	and then that little boy would say Charlie says always tell your mummy where you're going
F	but the cat could have been saying anything it was probably saying I want to lick my own bottom cos
A	probably
F	that's what cats like to do
A	it's more likely to be like feed me
F	yes
F	didn't we?
B	yeah yeah
F	all these stranger danger things
B	yeah
F	not so fast nicotine
F	Green Cross Code man
B	Green Cross Code man yeah Darth Vader wasn't he?
F	yeah and but nowadays you'd be told not to go anywhere near a strange man
D	there's erm in the US they have Smokey the bear who teaches you not to
F	yeah
D	like make forest fires and stuff and sort of outdoors
D	safety and I found a video somewhere online of a like I think it was sixties or seventies and the kid's sort of the woods camping and he sees like one of the Smokey the bear signs they have in the park but then like this really eerie music comes in and like the Smokey the bear like er someone dressed in a Smokey the bear suit steps out from behind the sign and it's like
F	mm
D	and starts like teaching it's terrifying
D	it's really scary
F	it is weird
D	it's really weird
F	you look back at these things
D	yeah
F	and they were terrifying
D	yeah
F	things god that's terrifying
B	Magic Roundabout
A	I love the Magic Roundabout
B	yeah
A	that's one thing that I mean and it was it me and you
D	yes
F	yeah
A	and I was like yeah that's true cos I loved all the like recent Disney releases as well as the old Disney releases and the Magic Roundabout like Dougal and the blue cat was one of my canon
F	as you know that's one
A	it's like yeah
F	I love Dougal
A	that's a cool film I don't understand why none of my friends knew what it was
F	it's a very niche thing not many people know about Dougal and the blue cat yeah Magic Roundabout was so cool
B	dunno how they got away with your Captain Pugwash and
B	Seaman Staines and all of that that
D	that was that was
F	Roger the Cabin Boy
D	that is er no Roger the Cabin Boy stayed I think
D	but I'm pretty sure that the version I got didn't have Seaman Staines
B	yeah
D	it was
A	why did they do that?
B	yeah Master Bates Seaman Staines
D	yeah
F	it was
F	in the seventies things were different then
B	yeah
F	it was a different culture
A	but I know a phenomenal amount of seventies theme tunes because you and dad always used to play that game
F	we might play it tonight now just for the
A	yeah
F	oh we used to have that oh his file server's gone down mind you
A	oh
F	he has plugged it in hasn't he downstairs?
D	yeah I think we could get it working
A	cos that was it and you'd do it like every Saturday or Friday night
F	er yeah
A	but you guys would always drink and you'd always forget what the answers were from last week
A	and I'd be there I wasn't even
F	this is a window into
F	I can only apologise now
A	I was like
A	only a kid but I'd
A	I don't think I ever saw that
A	what it is I'd remember cos I'm a twelve year old sponge
F	mm
A	both in of knowledge and your like supplies in the house
F	yes
F	ah happy times
B	mm
F	yeah I used to love all that seventies theme tunes
A	yeah
F	Black Beauty is easy
A	is the one goes
F	yeah it's the one that makes you want to start racing around the living room like a horse
A	and you know just like yeah
A	I've spilt my coffee
F	there's a lot of like horse cos then there's also the White Horses one
A	mm yeah but that has lyrics in and it goes like
A	there's something very nice about seventies theme tunes though I don't know
A	oh when we went to that gig the the Twin Peaks themed one
F	mm
A	that
F	oh I love Rhubarb and Custard
B	mm
A	I think they did erm they did Rainbow and I was like oh my god I have to film this for my mum and it was like you have no spare storage
F	damn it
D	I did I did save one of them I can't remember
A	but yeah Rainbow was particularly good
F	everyone loved Rainbow
A	and like like the the drummer
F	the famous
B	he was
F	oh
B	mm
F	Geoffrey and Bungle and Zippy and George
A	aren't they just these cuddly toys? is he not just a big man child?
F	I never really understood what was going on I'll be honest with you
F	but that was what it was like the seventies you never really understood what the kids' programmes were trying to
A	like
F	say
A	what is there a moral?
B	mm
F	it's like what why is
A	all the producers on LSD
F	mm
B	mm
F	with their
A	well you know it's still going with the Chipmunks they make all those Chipmunks films and they all just live with that man
F	it's not
A	don't don't they though? it's like they're his pets really
A	but they're like they have like human intelligence emotions and
A	he treats them like children
F	mm it's all very strange very strange
B	mm
F	mm and there was Fingerbobs and that was another man
F	who just made little conical things on his
F	Fingerbobs it's just this guy
F	like Fingerbobs it's like it would be like
F	that's the programme
F	that's it
B	couldn't get away with it now no
F	you could not get away with it and it was a very very different culture
D	you'll recognise this song well I recognise it as
A	oh it no it's that's
B	Red Dwarf yeah
A	Red Dwarf yeah
D	oh it's Red Dwarf yeah
A	is it?
A	oh yeah
D	they were very good
A	they were you can't really tell cos it's on a phone and loads of people were shouting the Red Dwarf theme tune
F	yeah
D	people were wild for it though
A	yeah
D	for for songs that everyone knows
A	it was just a medley of theme tunes
D	that you'd never think to like
A	from the last like twenty to thirty years
F	it's true you forget how much you like theme
A	and they're all connected yeah
F	yeah
A	and memories of series and and especially the ones that people remembered from their childhood I think they specially nuts for things like Rhubarb and Custard
F	well when we were playing that seventies theme
A	I know you did
F	it was really
A	you had to have a little weep
F	I did have a little weep cos I hadn't heard it in so long and I really liked it
A	and suddenly transported back to your
A	childhood song
F	a more innocent age I thought oh this was really
A	I no I get that completely cos
A	I put on Beauty and the Beast the other day I wasn't feeling very well so I put on erm the this
F	ah
A	and at certain points like like even just at the beginning I felt really like emotional cos I was like oh it reminds me of being young
F	well that was the one when I took you to see
F	the first time you saw it was at the cinema that was one where I bought you a Cornetto and as soon as it came on you were transfixed you were like
F	you were just like
A	I didn't eat the Cornetto
F	you didn't eat it you just let it just ran all the way you were just transfixed at this big
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a got reminded of their young times because of a disney movie	Contradiction
F	I think it was sort of the first proper big screen
A	I don't remember it
F	cos you'd seen we'd got The Little Mermaid on video watched that on
A	right
F	and you were only very little and you
A	mm
F	there's all this song
F	and I remember saying to
F	cos usually the most important thing when you're about three or four isn't it?
A	is an ice cream yeah
F	but you were like
B	used to have half time as well at the cinema didn't you?
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a has never watched the little mermaid	Contradiction
F	yeah
A	and they used to come round with the
F	interval
D	yeah yeah I remember that
F	you have an interval
D	yeah
F	you'd get the woman come round and there used to be a B movie when you went to see a Disney film you always had to watch some crappy documentary first about deep sea fishing or
F	it would be something a bit pants wouldn't it? and you'd be waiting for the actual good film to come on
[ANNOTATION]	there used to be an interval in disney movies	Entailment
A	uhu
D	yeah
F	and they'd make you watch some live action
A	which was probably a
F	it was
F	about the
A	you know like a dog that has to choose between er that's a usual example but
F	and then it was like
A	I've never heard of that before
F	come to the one you love boy come on come on and he had to choose which one he went to cos they both wanted this dog that's all I remember about the film cos I was just
A	that's quite heart wrenching to be on it's like they they
F	I just wanted that to sod off and get on with
F	Bambi and then Bambi came on and that was great and then we made my cousin
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a has a dog	Neutral
F	and he cried again cos he cried when Bambi's mum died and we all taunted him horribly and then we said we're getting Bambi
A	was he the youngest one?
[ANNOTATION]	speaker f hated the movie bambi	Neutral
F	yeah
A	ah
F	and he said we were getting him venison we're getting you a Bambi burger and chips
F	oh he's crying again
A	that's really bad
F	yeah
A	you were much nicer to me about The Lion King
[ANNOTATION]	someone cried	Entailment
F	well I'd grown up then I was only about eight or nine when we were teasing
F	and you do horrible things when you're a kid don't you?
D	mm
A	mm yeah kids can be horrible
F	I got teased when I cried at stuff it was a rite of passage it was like in our family if you cried at a film you would get mercilessly picked on by all your cousins and like
A	really?
F	are you crying? no
F	you're crying aren't you? no no so you if you watched any film that was emotional you had to keep it all in cos otherwise you would get mercilessly
F	so it was a
F	they do
A	it's quite it's quite harsh I mean Disney's like famous for pushing people's buttons like that
F	mm
A	like right straightaway a parent dies
F	cos they did exactly the same in The Lion King didn't they?
A	uhu
F	and it's the same
A	the same exact
F	they kill off the parent and just this whole having a cute baby animal going mummy?
A	or daddy?
A	why won't you wake up?
B	mm
A	oh god
F	and as I got older I really resented it I was like I know what you're doing Disney I know you're trying to push my buttons and make me cry I know what you're doing with your soaring
A	yeah yeah
F	voices and you'd be like I know what you're doing
F	with this music
A	it's you can't make me feel Disney
F	and that was the cinema as well
A	Mufasa
F	trampled in the stampede
D	who was also Darth Vader
F	mm
A	mm
F	well
D	doing the voice
F	you crying cried and cried and cried and cried and my whole right arm was just caked in snot it was just like
F	wet with
F	clinging to it and sobbing
F	so the film moves on and it gets to when he meets Pumbaa and
A	Simone and Pumbaa
F	Simone and Pumbaa
A	Timon and Pumbaa
A	yeah
F	and it's great and they do that you know the
A	yeah
F	yeah Hula
F	and I'm like oh there's a funny bit now
A	in a cloud
F	in a cloud and he's like no father don't leave me at the end and you went off again and I was oh for fuck's sake
F	just stopped her crying and now she's gone again
A	it reminded me of the pain of earlier
F	and you spent about two hours of the film I don't know how long the film is it's about an hour and a half
A	yeah
B	mm
F	in which case you spent about an hour of that in tears
F	then we took you to Argos after and bought you a Simba
A	that was a really good Simba that was
F	it was that that cheered you up
A	that was really soft I had that for years that Simba
F	mm thought we've gotta cheer
A	well you thought The Lion King a nice animation about
F	yeah I thought it would be
A	nature Disney
F	a really nice thing to take you to you were so distraught
B	mm
F	that I just felt really bad about making you sit through it then
A	no it's still one of my favourite Disney films
F	oh but it was just
A	it's really good
F	oh poor
A	I think it's important for kids to do that I don't know get an introduction to
F	loss
A	loss
F	oh and how life isn't always fair I suppose in Disney films there's always a bit of justice at the end but
A	yeah there's a little bit of Scar gets it
F	yeah
A	I was on the erm internet and I don't know how people know this but they were like what was Scar's name before he got the Scar?
B	yeah
A	people say oh it was something like Taka or something I can't remember exactly what it was and so which literally translates to garbage and Mufasa his brother literally translates to King and so so they called the king's the their sons King
F	King
A	King and Garbage
F	and Garbage they're just setting them up
A	it's like no wonder Garbage was so pissed off
F	it was it was gonna kick off wasn't it at some stage?
F	something's gonna happen
D	I think there are a lot of Lion King sequels and prequels which they've done
A	to explain
D	suppressed
C	you have to go and have a look so as you know why not to take the back off the computer
F	why would you do it?
B	exactly
B	I draw a line
B	a steering wheel and three pedals is where I start
C	it's something to do with the adapter I think cos it's not the right adapter
B	no it used to work though didn't it?
C	mm
B	mm
C	I'll have a look
B	mm
A	that's Fraggle Rock
D	mm
F	we were just talking about Disney films and how

F	mother
F	it's awful maybe the
C	Watership Down?
A	mm
F	the sad singing
D	mm
A	mm
C	all that
A	Watership Down's intense
C	yeah
A	isn't it?
F	that's pretty horrific
C	even The Snowman
F	ah
A	yeah and then it
D	yeah yeah we were saying that at Christmas weren't we?
A	yeah
C	it's a cartoon snowman
F	she had to watch it
A	that's so true
F	mum insisted she had to watch The Snowman she has to watch The Snowman every Christmas she was really kicking off cos she'd missed it then we found it was on plus one
F	and then she slept through it
A	yeah
F	instantly went to sleep
C	damn you
D	yeah
A	yeah
F	it was just so funny
A	cos she's had a bit of a go at grandad cos grandad said it was on at a certain time
D	mm
F	grandad had misread it
A	and he got it wrong
F	it was the Snowdog and she didn't want the The Snowman and the Snowdog
A	so we sat through that and then she was like well that wasn't the one I wanted to see
A	and then and then dad was like well shall we see if it's on plus one? yeah it's on plus one and she was like no it doesn't matter now he's like
F	it's too late now
A	no no we're telling you that you can it's not too late that you can you can watch it and then and then she was like alright then put it on after giving grandad a really hard time
A	and then about five minutes in she's asleep in her chair
F	and so we're all nudging each other going after all that fuss
C	asleep
D	she'd spent her energy on the wrong snowman
F	she's gone
D	yeah
A	ah
A	and she was the one nanny was the one who really had to see The Snowman like the rest of us you know
F	we didn't really care
A	we it's like yeah I'll take it or leave it
F	it's fine
F	yeah
A	mm and suddenly I'm asleep
A	but yeah the Snowdog was a bit sad cos involved a dog dying right at the start
D	uhu
F	well it's all
A	not cheerful
F	it's all part of life you can't have one without t'other it's all part of loss isn't it? you had your hamsters
A	my hamsters they always mysteriously disappeared in the night
A	where's he gone?
C	he's escaped
B	yeah
A	I never saw their little dead bodies you know it always seemed to happen when I was out and by the time I got home you're like bad news
A	you may notice the cage is empty
A	and that is cos your hamster's now under the rose bush
A	are you sure I was there for that?
F	yeah yeah cos I was like right you were part of it I wanted you to put it in the hole so you could be part of the burial
A	oh I must have then I've blocked it out too traumatic
F	but apparently I'd been like
F	I was just saying go on
F	and she was the other side of the fence laugh
A	ah
F	so it was a
A	lob it in the hole
F	I think that one was Paul cos you had one called Peter and one called Paul didn't you?
A	I did yeah
F	and I noticed I thought it was just sleeping cos they sleep like that in a little ball and he was up in like the little like stack tower
A	yeah and it was
F	and I realised he was a bit of a fly airport
F	they were all landing and taking off from him and he wasn't moving I was like he's attracting a lot of flies and
F	thinking about it I haven't seen him move for a day
A	ah
F	pokety-poke yeah
A	ah
F	well they only live a couple of years don't they? so
F	yeah you did have hamster
A	time
F	for a long time yeah different hamsters
A	I remember putting the hamster in its ball and freaking the dog out
A	it really freaked him out
F	blew his mind and whoa
F	it's not natural
A	cos the hamster ball was quite big and it would like walk towards him nope
A	had to go hide up a corner
F	didn't like the hamster ball
A	hamsters were fine weren't they? I mean they're little fluff balls
F	they're pretty the
A	that chew the bars
F	they're a good first pet for a kid sort of low maintenance but a bit of responsibility
D	I liked mine but he was really like he we had one of those plastic cages with all the sort of tubes and stuff
C	mm
F	yeah
D	but and he
C	did he?
D	all the time yeah and then he'd be really hard to find he'd get in parents' like clothes drawers and stuff
F	they are quite hard to catch
D	and an escaped hamster's really annoying you're like
A	yeah
D	and I was very like
D	and like and then my parents had to find him for me it was really hard
A	and where was he in the house?
D	yeah
D	and then eventually we got him a metal cage which he used to get his feet stuck in the bars of and
A	oh
D	and I used to have to keep adapting it like putting cardboard like thing I dunno he was really annoying
D	like and I'd be going to sleep or something
A	he was a burden
D	at eleven and then he'd sort of like get his foot caught and
C	wake up yeah
D	and you'd hear him going like
A	ah
D	go and free him
A	I think you told me once it was quite stressful
D	it was towards
D	towards the end of it
F	we didn't have any of this with our hamsters
C	too much responsibilities
A	no they were easy
F	they never did any of that
D	yeah towards
A	they chewed the bars a bit but
D	towards the end of Frodo's life he
F	but the
A	mm
D	yeah he was constantly getting in trouble and I he was in my room and I wouldn't sleep if I heard him making a noise and I'd go he's going to get himself into some sort of jam again isn't he?
A	your hamster was called Frodo
D	yeah
F	ah that's nice we had one called Radagast
A	yeah I said that you guys had great hamster names
F	we had Galdalf and Radagast yeah
D	mm
D	yeah
A	and
D	yes
A	an interesting connection
F	yeah
D	and a hedgehog called Elrond
A	yes you did have a hedgehog
D	mm
A	you called Elrond
A	an appropriate name for a hedgehog
D	and we had the whole collection between us
A	yeah
F	so good pets
D	uhu
F	well
A	never doing that again
D	mm
F	parents do this in good faith cos you kind of think
D	yeah
F	getting a kid a pet is gonna teach them a a degree of
C	mm
F	compassion and empathy and
C	mm
F	responsibility so it's got a lot of positives hasn't it?
D	yeah
A	I think after our hamsters died like it wasn't that long until dad got
D	uhu
A	I'm not sure how the timeline quite matches up but I feel like I got old enough to like have a part in looking after the dog and then I didn't need hamsters anymore cos I could
C	mm
A	take
F	yeah
A	and bath him
F	yeah
A	which you know
F	cos you had quite a lot cos you had we had the dog plus we had
A	cats
F	the cats we had Brad and Jeremy
A	and a big fish for a while
F	yeah we had the tropical fish
D	yeah
F	those bloody things
A	and then we had fish again
A	at
F	those bloody things
A	platys that wouldn't stop having babies
F	those bloody things
A	bought five within a month we had fifty fifty tiny babies with giant eyes
F	if I could give anybody any advice it would be don't get fish cos they are
A	they're a rubbish pet
F	fucking awful
F	they're just awful
C	did you tip them in the moat?
F	you think
F	yeah we did give a lot away
A	and it was from the fish shop in
F	not er do you mean the one on the way to
A	maybe
C	oh just past erm
A	I don't know I thought it
D	there's nothing in
A	but
F	yeah
A	it was really far away anyway and we had to take this bag of fish in like a sandwich bag
A	and I think in the end we gave them away to a good home off Gumtree or something
D	yeah
F	yeah cos you think it's gonna be lovely and relaxing it'll be a beautiful
A	mm
F	like the kind of you see in doctors'
C	mm
F	a dentist's surgery that you know it's gonna be relaxing they're nice to and they are but they're it's er you have to do it as a full time job if you want to have a beautiful
C	they're a pain aren't they? yeah
F	pristine tank
C	mm
F	cos the instant you slack it's just like the
D	yeah you have to change the water all the time
F	horrible
A	and something went wrong with our golden apple snail its shell went wrong didn't it? and it was all like crusty
D	I think that happens to them
C	oh
F	yeah er do you remember when we
C	yes
A	yes I remember that
F	do you remember that? what is monster?
A	oh my god cos
F	like it's a what is?
A	and he just took one look at my water snail and went what is monster?
A	it's a golden apple snail okay?
A	it's just not well
F	he's not right
A	he's a bit not right
A	not a monster
A	oh that I'd forgotten that he said that
F	yeah what is monster?
A	that's a great
A	I like the babies

D	yeah
A	he said it in a funny way

F	he was funny what is monster?
A	what is monster?
F	it's our snail alright?
C	do you remember when he painted our erm gingerbread house thing
F	I do
C	and we were like mortified?
C	no
F	it wasn't what he had in mind
A	what did he do?
C	he painted all these like evil faces on it
A	which is so Russian
C	and no sweetie wrappers
F	just and we said no this is meant to be looking like sweets and I don't know if that's what sweets look like in Russia
C	and we were like
F	thanks for helping
C	bye
F	yeah I guess
A	yeah
F	they do things differently in Russia
A	they do or like all these Russian jokes about houses with chicken legs
F	they they're very long and involved and at the end of it you're no wiser you have no idea
A	he was showing me some pretty trippy like Russian cartoons from the eighties as well
A	it's like and now they the dog and the dancing man have abducted the king and
D	uhu
F	oh those Russians
A	those Russians
F	yeah they are they are a very different
F	but yeah I've got a lot of fondness for
A	oh I love
F	he's very funny and sweet
A	he is
F	cos not everyone can live with
A	no
F	mm
F	I love him to bits
A	that can cos he's just the perfect fit for him
D	uhu
A	it balances him out
D	dunno dunno anything
D	like that's his like physically attractive type and then he can get away with so many
A	oh oh I see what you mean
F	oh yeah
A	to
D	yeah to
F	yeah
A	yeah
D	like a supermodel
A	yeah cos
A	cos
D	yeah so he's he gets to get he gets a pass on another
A	he gets to like
D	a few annoying habits
A	he gets to live with a big bear
D	yeah
A	who has many quirks
D	yeah
A	many many quirks
D	yeah
A	so quirky
A	so quirky
F	I want to know how big his redundancy package must have been
A	cos he still hasn't got a job
F	cos he still hasn't got a job
A	and he bought a house
F	he's paid off part of his mortgage he's still having foreign holidays
D	yeah
F	he's still talking about you know redecorating and buying this and buying
D	mm
F	and I'm like how fucking big was your pay off? cos
A	no he was saving for a long time
D	I think he saved for a while and but it must have been alright I mean he's worked there a long time and it was
F	well he's not doing very well
A	mm
F	at getting another job is he?
D	no
F	cos he's not good at interviews he's had
A	he's not gonna going to interviews
F	interviews and he doesn't turn up to them
D	it must be hard
A	yeah
D	yeah it must be hard
F	it is hard at his age
D	yeah
F	it is and it's hard at my age but I did it cos I'm really cool
F	and very clever
A	and adaptable
F	I am very adaptable
A	he's not he's very
F	I know how to play the game
A	you always said it's really unlikely that
C	mm
A	whilst making a lot of bread and just
A	doing you know doing his like erm IT stuff but he could
F	yeah
A	he was free to do pretty much like his his lifestyle at the same time as being employed
C	yeah
A	which is a really rare thing to get
C	yeah
A	really rare
F	mm it is I mean I would love to live that lifestyle
A	mm
F	I would I'd
A	yeah
F	if you didn't have to go into the office
A	it's just unlikely that he's going to find something like that again
F	yeah
A	it's not impossible but
F	yeah
A	where you don't actually have to go into the office
A	ever
F	and when you are at home you
D	mm
A	yeah
F	cos that was foolish
F	that does
A	but you don't
F	that does help you select
D	mm
C	mm
A	time
F	yourself for redundancy doesn't it?
A	and the times
C	yeah
F	lose the dead wood
A	twelve PM
F	you can trim
A	yeah
F	so I was like I would always think well that's fair enough but why would you post it in Facebook?
E	yeah
A	pretend
F	post it in the evening
A	that you did it but much later
D	the working from home culture is very different though to like sort of officey breaking down the neck culture like there's a lot of
A	if
D	like I don't post that much cos I always think people who have illustration projects with me or my agency will be like oh he's just doing nothing today but a lot of people do and it seems to like I think there's I guess if you're promoting yourself and you're like anything you do online
A	it depends what you're posting
D	is worthwhile but it seems like a lot of people really just post like don't are goofing off during the day and and it doesn't seem to hurt them I don't know
A	I don't know how much it does hurt them
D	not sure what the etiquette is
A	cos it I do seem to see like
D	mm
A	even people who do work in offices like they'll post a picture of some silly thing they've done with their desk or something
C	mm
F	I won't post anything
D	yeah
A	yeah
F	on any of my personal sites during office hours I'll often think of stuff and I think well I'll just save that till later and I'll
A	yeah
F	I'll wait until gone five I'll post on my work accounts cos obviously
D	uhu
A	mm
F	I'm working
D	yeah
F	cos I know much as I like my office
D	uhu
F	but I
D	yeah
A	that you're
F	watching the telly
A	yeah
C	mm
F	I would rather just you know keep it under wraps and think well I'll post in the evening
D	uhu
F	that you know the lovely meal I'm about to have or
A	yeah
F	the thought for the day but I think if you're being employed to work
A	uhu it depends
F	I just think you're shooting yourself in the foot
C	mm
F	if you're posting pictures online of you fucking about
D	yeah
F	basically
A	yeah it makes sense and it does depend exactly what you're posting like how much of a distraction is it and was it in your lunch hour? you know
C	mm
A	that sort of thing
F	yeah
A	or was it you know at a time that couldn't possibly have been you know a break or? well it depends what kind of job you have
F	if you're saying this is like
D	yeah
F	a sourdough recipe you have to brew this for several days then you have to knead it leave it for two hours knead it again wait half an hour stretch it prove it
D	yeah
F	knead it again then bake for three minutes and and it's like yeah you've just described you've taken up a whole day fucking about
D	yeah it was the whole thing
D	it was
A	that in particular
D	er wreaked of having too much time on your hands that that whole post yeah
A	you're not busy are you?
F	no
D	yeah
F	and I'm just thinking if I was a manager and I'd been asked to make redundancies within the team
C	mm
F	the first thing I'm gonna do is like who is on a Facebook pissing about
A	yes
F	that you
C	mm
F	should have been working on rather than making bread or not?
A	yeah
D	but I think
D	was quite careful about not cos he he made very clear he wasn't interested in promotion or taking on extra responsibilities and I think he had a you know on a level that he could
A	where he could get all of his work done
F	yeah
D	he could get he could clear his duties and
A	and then
F	and he did do very well for a long time and
D	mm
F	I was quite envious cos I thought
D	yeah
F	that is you know
A	yeah
F	you are living the kind of life
C	mm
F	we'd all like to
D	mm
F	so it's good it lasted while it's as long as it did
A	but I'm starting to show that a lot of people are more productive when they work from home
F	yeah I get more done at home
D	yeah
F	but it is
C	you're not as distracted are you?
F	no
D	no
A	no there's actually fewer distractions because people don't come up and talk to you about
D	yeah
A	their stuff
D	or there are choices that you they are distractions you've made out of choice in a moment when you need one
F	yeah
D	as opposed to one you
A	like a natural break in your concentration
C	yeah
D	yeah
A	and you're like oh I'll just check this or
F	but you do kind of have to it's
A	yeah
F	frustrating cos I'm not I know exactly what you're saying
A	got to be careful about it
F	but you have to play the
A	you have to play the game yeah
C	mm
D	uhu
F	because I know my office colleagues would be like gossip they would be saying oh you know I bet
A	yeah
D	mm
A	yeah you have to be like
F	or
A	no I didn't spend a moment not concentrating
A	I didn't spend a single moment not concentrating cos of course that's not true in any office
F	no
D	mm
A	anyway
C	mm
F	you know well I'm not having coffee breaks or conversations about telly or
A	no
F	you know any of that stuff I'm just getting on it with it you know
A	uhu
F	but it's not the way human nature works is it?
D	mm
A	no
D	yeah
F	but there you see that's where
F	just
A	other people will think this if you do that
F	and I say this as one of his best friends
A	yes
F	but he doesn't he doesn't empathise you know he doesn't
C	yeah
F	get so he won't have been because it's logical to him he assumes it's logical
A	like well I got all my work done so I made some bread you know
F	and it's like it is logical
F	however human nature means that they'll be like looking for
D	mm
F	people will be looking for weaknesses
C	yeah
F	you've gotta look dynamic for fuck's sake
D	yeah
F	that's what I'm saying
D	mm
F	look dynamic
A	yeah
A	working so hard
D	but it's harder to take pictures of it
A	I
D	instead of like
F	yeah
A	no you like post so just like eight o'clock
F	oh I'm so stressed so much to do
A	I've finally finished for the day
C	yeah
F	oh I'm so overworked
F	and I've got so much to do so little time
D	yeah
F	it's like it's all game
A	mm
F	and it's about how you manage
F	yes
A	how much it looks like you're doing
F	exactly and the
D	mm
F	people that get on and the people that get promoted are all the ones that know how to play the game
A	maybe that's why it's shooting yourself in the foot when people are like oh can you take on this project? you'll be like oh yeah yeah I haven't you know I've got time to do it you've gotta be like well I I
F	oh I dunno
A	I really I really wanna help you out and I'm excited about this project but I I'm snowed at the moment I'm completely snowed
F	mm
F	I'm so full I don't know where I'm gonna get a window
A	yeah but you can leave it on my desk if you want to and I'll see if I can get to it
F	mm
A	you know and even if you like
F	yeah
A	actually I've got tonnes of time I could do that next week like
A	lower those expectations
F	mm
A	cos otherwise like oh you've got plenty of time have you? have these five million other things I learnt that quite quickly as like an admin assistant
C	mm
A	you'd be like never underplay or even be honest er er even
F	mm
A	about exactly how much work you've got always be like I've got a bit more work than I you actually have to do because
D	yeah
A	if you say I've got this much work people always underestimate how much time that actually takes
C	mm
