B	amazing
B	he said fuck
D	wow
C	that's really cool
B	that's not very
A	yeah
D	guess what's for
C	mm
A	yes I I was always I really like the ideas of chess ladders you have er some sort of
D	what?
B	what?
A	in primary there was like chess club and chess ladders so if you're like number ten and you beat number two you go to number two and then go down to number ten
D	cool
B	oh wow
A	and the person at the top never wants to play anybody
D	I was
A	there was a rule you had to play like three games a week or something so I had
A	I think it was like I think it was after like after school stuff when you had to stay after school and like
D	wow
A	and it was a play centre
D	yeah
A	no it's like if your parents are at work or something
B	yeah
A	and you can't go home

D	yeah I know I can't be bothered
A	like er like just sort of on a Saturday like
D	yeah
A	do it illegally just set up and be like

A	thirty quid
D	I think this is my you could have them chairs if you want to
D	there's five of them they're pretty good
B	yeah
D	other furniture do that
B	yeah
D	yeah well why don't or you could just put it like and sell them once or whatever and
A	bit too much money and I think no one'll buy them
D	yeah
A	like get out get out your nice stuff and end up selling it
D	yeah
A	yeah or just like five hundred quid but you like and maybe someone would buy it
D	yeah
B	then it would be worth it however much you liked it
A	yeah
D	I'm too honest in like Ebay stuff too mm I'm like this product really isn't that good you know
D	or like not like if someone told them to get it and be like this isn't what you said that's what er it's not that great
D	like but no it it does the job

B	yeah
D	have you guys been to that casino in
B	no
D	that's a good casino do you reckon it would be funny and we should go?
B	no I think it would be horrible
D	it would be horrible
A	no I think it
D	it would be funny definitely
A	probably be like a
D	it would be really proper it'll be like it'll be big and sort of
A	probably quite fancy though
D	it would be fancy in that really shit way
A	yeah
D	like loads of like purple and red and so on
B	yeah with loads of purple
A	but it's good they used to be at the
C	really?
A	there are so many like tactics that they have in casinos that to make you
D	yeah
A	like feel good
D	yeah
C	oh
A	like they have like mind games
C	shit cool
C	shall we open a casino?
D	yeah well let's
C	that would be cool
D	the rest is easy
B	naked land?
D	yeah well
C	I once went to the casino in Melbourne thinking it would be funny and it was so depressing
D	I got kicked out of that yeah
C	did you? what for?
D	I only once went well I've only been only once
D	when I was like eighteen
A	once got kicked out of a casino never again
D	got kicked out of a casino
C	what for?
D	I dunno well
B	probably
D	probably
B	he's a spacer
C	you probably did
D	I probably did
C	it was so depressing I walked in one end and went out the other
D	yeah it was just not
C	after a party
D	an exciting place at all it's it's really er
C	it's like there's there's erm there's like a food court going on there sort of thing
B	oh no
D	it's quite bad
C	and it's just feel like
D	yeah
C	there's no like
B	why did you get thrown out? you can't even remember?
C	oh but bet it was so bad you can't tell them
D	erm
D	well maybe like well I was under age or something stupid probably like like a probably acting stupid you know
B	what's wrong with that?
A	the skin
B	don't like the skin?
D	everyone goes to the casino
B	that's where all the brain fuel is
D	everyone goes to the one in Sydney now because when I just went back in October all the licensing laws had changed so pubs can open after one AM
B	is that for a casino?
D	and Sydney's usually full twenty-four hour bars so they've recently just
C	why has that changed?
D	because loads of people were dying or being put into comas from like king hits which was like
C	what?
D	someone would pull up in a car run up and punch someone in in the back of the head or just like unexpectedly
D	say you and me were walking along
A	a happy slap?
B	a happy slap but punching?
D	what's a happy slap?
A	happy slap that's when you go to like
D	right like a random person
A	and slap someone and you film it and then put it on the internet
D	yeah kind of like that except like a punch and like every weekend someone was either in a coma or dead from a from the from this
B	wow
D	so like they instead of like targeting that they just stopped
C	but like erm
D	so they they cut the
C	does that has that solved the problem?
D	er when I was there it was really fresh so it was like it had only happened like a month before or something so I think they probably use statistics in their favour
C	doesn't make any sense
D	and it was
C	it means they get a big bribe from the casino
D	so crap it was like yeah yeah
A	do you know
D	paid by the casino
A	the casino has got like friends in politics who they've got
D	yeah absolutely like it
C	yeah probably
A	is that how it all works?
D	but you know the it was really fucking awful and that I I didn't really
B	and a punch
D	have a good time in like in October when I went over and
C	I can't see anything depressing about it cos it's so long ago I thought I might have changed
B	I didn't find it like that at all but that cos yeah cos you cos when we went like it was completely fine and then then we met and then we figured out maybe it was cos you were with a girl like a mixed group mixed gender group
D	when you were there?
B	yeah
D	yeah
B	and so you're less likely to get picked on for fights and stuff
D	yeah we had we got like you know
B	cos we didn't like we didn't get any hassle at all from anyone
D	it's cos I'd been to a wedding and like and even without it was like me and five other dudes and like when you're in those groups like people like wanna fight
B	and people wanted to fight you?
D	yeah yeah like not
B	I didn't have the
D	not
A	yeah
D	didn't want to
A	oh no I would be too scared to
B	always
B	I remember that that was like international right? like people were just getting women and stuff and like in the middle of the day and
D	really? it's very I'm sure it's happened more than once but I guess it it
B	I once thought I'd been happy slapped I hadn't
B	it was when happy slaps was like a massive thing I was like
B	cos it was like Youtube was new as well so it was like
B	this new phenomenon of being made like made a fool of publicly
B	like I was er everyone was doing it and I was walking down the street to get a bus I was walking er I was trying to catch this bus I was like walking quite quickly and I
B	someone hit my
B	hit my face and I was like oh my god oh my god oh my god I've been happy slapped
B	and I just and I just like okay like quick to react so I
D	yeah yeah yeah
B	and got on the bus and I looked back and it was some guy and he'd been hailing the bus behind me but and put out his hand
C	no ah
B	and I walked in I walked into his hand and slapped myself
B	and he was going
D	that's really funny
B	sorry sorry
B	it's was like it's alright
C	that's so good
C	he was hailing a bus
B	oh my god oh my god oh my god it's happening
B	it's like oh no
B	he was like
B	and I just like
D	yeah trying to say sorry and you're like
B	I'd shuffled off so quickly or
D	yeah yeah yeah
B	or he wanted to apologise
D	no erm
B	look at that guy while it happened
D	no reaction
B	if I'm going on Youtube right you're not getting any reaction
B	off me
C	I was blissfully ignorant of the whole thing so it didn't affect me at all
C	I had no idea what was happening
A	there was like a scary one at our school er when I was younger like you
D	mm
C	oh
A	and like the they had a knife
D	oh god
B	oh like they were just like
D	that's awful
C	that's horrible
B	no that's not very happy is it?
D	no
B	did you ever used to get like bad feedback at
D	yeah a little bit
C	yeah a little bit we've discussed since then
B	I know those those ones at the end though but like in the class like how did you handle it? but
A	on the Sunday thing?
B	one today one for an
B	erm
C	embarrassing I don't
B	we
A	oh
B	never really had any any complaints er we we had a couple of complaints er specifically about staff members
C	mm
B	erm yeah
B	not actually about
B	that was before that erm and
C	yeah
B	so with something like food poisoning for example he would always like
C	oh god I
B	no but it's like a common thing
B	but it's like
C	I just saw it like straight away it was like cos one was on Twitter the other two were emails
D	what have you got what what did they say?
C	just got three complaints this weekend about stuff everything looked beautiful
D	but what were the complaints about?
C	but I don't know if this is just a thing of like volume like if you get over a certain amount of thing then like suddenly you get people's opinions one was that a cake was like not super light it was a vanilla cake and she has been doing that and like I do need to practise it with her erm
D	they wanted they wanted a light oh bloody hell
D	yeah cool
C	another one was like
D	yeah fair enough yeah
C	another one was like
A	yeah what did they what what was the complaint?
C	that the sponge wasn't very light
D	it wasn't light
C	which is true that's a lovely recipe and she's just been making it wrong and
D	the lady wanted a light cake
C	they
D	it's a Sunday she wanted a light cake yeah
D	okay
C	to order so she probably spent a hundred quid on it you know
D	oh it was a whole cake? I thought it was like a mini one the kind of
C	it was to order she was very nice she was she wrote a
D	yeah
C	and I'd been chatting to her for a while so that was fine another one was a cake to look like a brain and she hadn't done it before and she didn't do it very well
D	yeah if you wanna come in
C	but then I thought
D	then fuck you yeah
C	maybe that's a bad idea because
B	yeah
C	everyone will start fucking complaining on Twitter
B	yeah
C	to get a free cake
B	but on Twitter on Twitter what
C	mm
B	like Twitter's so powerful cos so many people potentially read it that like what you wanna do is just take it off as soon as possible and like and let and then you know deal with them separately cos basically it's
D	yeah it's a really good thing
B	it's it's such a shit thing to
D	that's a really good thing to say just come in just er just email me
B	yeah just
D	sorry about that
B	so so
C	I
D	yeah
C	and then I didn't and then I just
C	like
A	got back to them again
B	email me
D	yeah
C	mm
D	yeah it's not fair to do it on Twitter really
C	but it's definitely made me feel bad
C	mm
D	what's the scores on yak
A	I've got ten
D	who's on ten?
A	I'm er I am
D	you are? what am I on?
A	oh wait you I'm not on ten I'm on
D	what?
A	you're on
B	mm
D	I'm on six apparently you're on four
D	four?
A	but it said I had ten likes on my thing
D	yeah but it's probably
B	maybe they took it away
D	bring it down again
A	oh yeah there was the funniest that I saw today was
D	yeah I I like that that'll get a like
B	but yeah so so I guess the main thing is that he would like then say okay I'm
B	and you know like
D	that's very
B	like because because but because people cos people have er you know if you accept if you recognise that you're not one hundred percent perfect then people remember oh of course like
C	mm
B	like people make mistakes if you think that the mistake was valid
C	mm
B	as well erm you know oh we'll look into it and try and work out ways to do it blah blah blah
C	yeah
B	erm and then I guess you just have to decide whether you're gonna like like whether you're actually gonna do anything or just
D	ha
B	so so that
C	how many complaints does he get?
D	that that yeah
B	quite it's quite a lot
C	is it auto reply?
A	yeah a macro
B	quite a lot
B	yeah I mean it's a big restaurant like you could like like all
C	mm
B	it's part of the job it's part of the thing and so you have like a you know an email formula and then you just so so that you spend as little er emotional energy on it as possible
C	mm
B	I think for long term he would sort of for ages he like
B	rewrite it again
D	oh god
B	and be like oh actually like really really like polite and nice
B	erm
C	my instinct is always to give somebody something else that you know is nice and then it's like
B	yeah but if if but if you're happy to do that
C	because it cos also it's just cos
B	then just do it
C	I feel bad and I want them to have a good cake
B	yeah of course
D	they continue to think they're right though
B	no but that's but that's what
D	ah but
B	but but if you're but if you feel like if you sort of yeah if you kind of rationalise and and you know say
C	yeah
B	like
C	yeah
B	like there's definitely a way of doing that
B	erm
C	I think also if I sort of
D	yeah
C	and have a
D	that's the best one
C	no but then it's like
D	that's it full stop
C	oh you know our bakery has
D	sorry I didn't make it
C	high standards and you know
C	and we have a new employee and I probably should have spent more time with him on you know and we can offer you something in compensation
B	well
D	I wouldn't say I wouldn't say
B	no
D	I should have spent more time with him
B	don't yeah don't say what you should do
D	no
B	say what you're going
D	it's none of their business
B	like in the future
D	it's none of their business how much you're like
B	I will like I will look into this and so we've got a new employee thanks for letting like thanks for letting me know
D	yeah
B	in the future I'll make sure like to keep an eye on certain thing erm
D	it's er
