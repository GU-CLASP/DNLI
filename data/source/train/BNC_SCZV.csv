D	I mean they didn't test me but I just sat there and did it myself
B	yeah
D	yeah
B	let's hope it continues
D	well my Dad had good eyes until he was about forty I think
A	so did I
B	mm
D	mm
A	I could read anything
D	mm
B	mm
A	until I was forty
D	hm
A	your lenses harden
D	mm
A	and your muscles can't contract the lenses anymore
D	hm
B	yeah
C	if you steam your face would that help?
D	hm
A	well there used to be an old Indian way of doing it the where you where you had to shut one eye an and look and try and focus as close as close you can go and then the other one
C	yeah but if your eyes are hardening you need to soften them
A	you can't do it
C	somehow
A	yeah
C	Don't you think?
A	you can't do it though
C	yeah
A	I've asked all about it
C	yeah
A	I think oh well I'd a done it if I was younger but if you're younger you got longer to live with no sight
B	it's a very difficult thing to do
A	and
C	mm
A	when you're older you think well I might as well go on as I am
C	mm
D	mm
C	I'd be tempted
B	and we didn't realize you had to keep doing it every two years sometimes
A	every two years
D	wow
A	it wear up
C	mm
D	mm
A	your your lenses
B	yeah
A	carry on either hardening
C	mm
A	or
D	mm
A	you're getting shorter sighted or longer sighted all the time as you get older
D	hm
C	they love it
A	yeah
C	they love it
D	they all loved it
C	they
D	and they haven't had to have it
C	no
A	no?
C	no
B	hm
C	I don't know anybody who's had to have it done again
B	yeah
D	but maybe they've just been lucky
B	yeah
C	most of them say it's the best thing they've ever done
D	mm
A	yeah
C	mm
D	hm
A	it's about nearly a thousand pound for both eyes
C	mm
A	but that might be
C	I think I should do it
B	is it? No it's not quite is it
A	well they can do it for long sight a short-sighted one's easier than they can do it for long-sighted
C	mm
A	then let's say from three hundred and sixty-five pound
B	oh right
A	each eye
B	yeah
A	and that's the cheapest is three hundred and sixty-five quid
C	yeah and you're unlikely to have the cheapest eyes type
B	right
C	are you
A	no
C	that was for someone with no stigmatisms
A	that's right
C	no I don't know
B	yeah
A	so you can actually say a thousand quid that's going to cost you
C	I'd like to do it
A	you didn't sort it then
C	yes
A	you didn't say
C	well no but
A	oh I see
C	no I couldn't do it
A	no well you didn't sort it then
C	no I didn't say that I
A	that's what I was going to do
C	well I didn't find it out
A	you didn't say anything
C	well no cos well
B	it's
A	oh
C	au naturel
B	mm
A	I think a little bit daft myself
C	why? Well actually yeah I pressed the button by accident and then I thought oh
C	well I'll just keep going
A	oh I see
C	I don't know how to make an MP3 dad
A	no
C	no
D	you must be able to do it
C	mm
D	because the trouble is with the software we've got I don't think we can use an MP4 to listen to it
A	no that's right
B	I thought they were all just MP3
A	well I thought well MP3 is supposed to be
C	I don't know anything about iPods
A	mP3 is supposed to be sound
D	mm
A	mP4
D	yeah you can watch videos as well
A	is
B	oh right
A	so you've got the MP4 soundtrack on a video
D	mm
A	and that's what that tried to do when we no tried to change it back to MP4
D	yeah
A	yeah
D	and they can't play MP4
A	no
B	oh
A	and my my um
C	I don't know
A	my little camera or both our little cameras record in MP4
D	mm
A	MPEG
C	mm
A	and
D	mm
A	well there will be
C	like always
B	mm
C	well if there's no video why would you need the MP4?
A	well that's right
A	but that's an MP4 track you see
C	oh
D	mm
A	your
C	but they used to put music on videos before
A	you can put anything on video
D	mm
C	they just try and confuse you so you just keep up-to-date all the time
B	yep
A	mm
C	those iPods though
A	no
C	I've always wanted a Mac computer once but never gone for the iPod
D	I I think
C	Cos everybody's usually break after a year
B	that's right
A	oh is it? Oh I've had that
C	one year old? Kaput
A	yeah
C	I don't know why
B	mm
C	how long have you had that?
B	like most things
A	how long have I had that? Since last birthday
B	no it was a couple of birthdays now
A	was it a couple of birthdays?
C	so it's quite old then?
B	must be
A	yeah
C	but you don't use it every day
A	no I don't use it every day
C	it every day don't they
B	we've hardly used it
A	yeah
C	mm
A	in Pembrokeshire
B	that's about it really
D	yeah
A	she couldn't get the radio
D	hm
A	couldn't even get BBC
D	yeah
A	one or two or whatever on
D	yeah
A	on an ordinary radio
D	well that's another thing they've updated and
A	and it's useless
A	yeah
B	mm
D	and there's DAB
B	yeah
C	dAB?
A	and the television
D	digital
A	yeah
D	whatever it stands for
A	the television
D	terrestrial
C	yeah
A	analogue
D	analogue
A	yeah
D	mm
A	Don't you
C	yeah
A	and this one
C	doing it isn't it
A	it didn't even record some of the stuff did it
B	no well we
A	well I'm hoping someone'll bring a
B	should be a
D	what is there someone coming round?
B	no
A	no
B	we've ordered a
A	well the postman should bring us something today
D	oh right
B	A booster
D	oh okay
B	booster signal thing to go up in the loft
C	but why do you need a booster when they made you turn over to digital and it was all fine before? And then you have to buy a booster?
A	yeah
B	but we think our thing up that's up in the loft that connects
D	right
B	two televisions
A	it connects all the televisions
B	we think that's very old now
A	around the house
C	oh I see
A	of the televisions
C	so the connector might
B	so we're guessing anyway
C	just be a bit old
A	so the connector's gone
C	mm
D	mm
A	plus with the new digital television you're supposed to have a digital aerial
D	hm
A	on your roof
D	mm
A	but now they do digital aerials with all this
D	well they're just constantly changing and like
B	it's too many letters isn't it
C	hang on they told
B	mP3
B	VHS
C	all they said you need was a new television when the digital came in
A	all you need is a box
C	when actually you need a new aerial a new television
A	yeah
C	new cable
B	mm
A	and when the wind blow
D	mm
A	that seem to blow them away
A	and you don't get a signal at all
A	and on on the Sky box thing well that's not a Sky box but a
B	satellite?
A	satellite
D	hm
A	so
D	mm
A	whichever way you can't win
C	mm
A	and yet analogue was brilliant
C	before digital
A	yeah
C	what's analogue then? Just a company?
A	no it's it's a way of it's a VH VHF very high frequency
C	oh
A	and that's that's what we used
B	I don't understand it
C	it just it just seems really strange that they make you change it for something worse than
A	yeah
A	well that was supposed to free up the the wavelengths on on er VHS
D	mm
A	F rather
D	and with digital it can contain more information like embedded in it
A	yeah
D	like you put the radio on
C	what subliminal?
D	and instead of just going through the frequency range it tells you what channel you're on
A	yeah that's right
C	yeah
B	mm
D	and if you select BBC one you
A	and what's playing
C	oh yeah
B	yeah
D	and stuff like that
B	that's quite nice
D	yeah
B	I like to know what's playing
A	that tell you what's playing but
D	yeah
A	can it see you?
A	all these secret little things that they keep sticking in like all this
C	well your computer camera you can't even cover it up
A	yeah
C	I have to turn ours round
C	I won't have those
D	sometimes it comes on on its own
A	does it?
D	yeah
A	oh
C	yeah
B	what's looking at you?
D	the camera
C	the camera
D	sometimes
C	on your if you sit at your computer I just want to cover it up
D	sometimes
C	that camera is there
D	sometimes er the the light comes on and it's activated
A	is it?
D	just and there's sites you can go and you can get into anyone's computer and look through their webcam
A	oh right
C	oo
A	that's good ain't it
C	so we never have it pointing at us
A	no?
A	oh well
C	I know
B	that's scary isn't it
A	yeah
C	that's why whenever you phoned us on Skype you always used to see the sofa before you saw us
A	oh
C	oh I know
D	yeah cos people haven't got if they haven't got their privacy settings correct on their computer
A	yeah
D	you can use their IP address
A	yeah you can
D	and then look through their webcam
A	yeah
D	and people have actually used it to see what's in people's houses
D	and stuff like that
A	yeah
A	yeah
C	mm
A	but
C	mm
A	that must get into your head
D	mm
C	yeah
A	it get into mine cos there's a ringing sensation all the time
