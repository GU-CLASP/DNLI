B	american society
A	yes no it was um
A	mm
B	the countryside versus rich cities
A	yep
B	and the whole sort of the er the sort of states versus federal government
A	mhm
A	yeah
B	um
A	and I quite like the idea of taking sort of Jerry Springer like a step too far
B	oh yes it did
A	the idea of entertainment sort of yeah
B	suffering
A	suffering
B	well that I mean that's nothing new
A	yep
B	they've done shows er they've done films and television programmes based on taking reality TV too far
[ANNOTATION]	Suffering as a sort of entertainment is not a new idea.	Entailment
A	oh yeah
B	before
A	I don't think that was the main point but it did sort of made me think of that actually that bit which was
B	yeah indeed
B	oh police cars
B	waiting for
B	that would be really funny if the
B	sorry can't get out
B	um that was yes
A	yeah it was um
B	well I think the idea
[ANNOTATION]	The TV show about police cars showed how they make the bulletproof windows.	Neutral
A	or
B	of being which was only mentioned very briefly that you can trade sort of increased odds for food
A	right
B	um
A	which was presumably why that guy had so many?
B	yes
A	I didn't know if it was a kind of punishment
B	no I think it was
A	yeah yeah I think it's supposed to be buying them
B	yeah
A	and
B	mm
A	all that kind of idea and the sort of um playing the media
[ANNOTATION]	They were sure it was some type of punishment.	Contradiction
B	er yes er
B	um
[ANNOTATION]	B thinks that no shows are actually based on reality TV.	Contradiction
A	she'd have been fine
B	I've no idea
A	yeah
B	um but it
A	I I was just like as I was watching it I I wasn't sure whether it was gonna be kind of say three films for for the whole story or whether they were gonna stop halfway through the game
B	well no that would've
A	doing that cos that would've been yeah
[ANNOTATION]	It's technically supposed to be selling them, not buying them.	Contradiction
B	far too
A	exactly
B	um
A	er and then I didn't know if it was different people each time and just a sort of different storyline
B	yeah
A	so I assume it's gonna be the same people
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	as a sort of
B	mm
A	yeah
A	just a to keep  to keep  sort of milking that one
B	yeah
A	you know sort of play with it
B	what was I gonna say? Um
A	mm
B	well no but there's obvious reasons for it
A	mm
B	then that means you have good odds of surviving the first half
A	and then you
B	which you then split split up again
A	mm
B	um but
A	it relies on other people playing fair though
B	well indeed you have to
A	someone could gather all the strong people to then kill them all
B	well it would be inherently quite difficult to kill them
A	but then that's the hard bit
A	mm
B	killing her
A	killing her herself cos everyone else was doing it
B	I think that's quite predictable
A	yeah
B	but I assumed that the friend was gonna be killed
A	yeah
B	it was a surprisingly yeah that was a very sort of yeah this is a book for sort of children as in this is that was a very positive ending to it
A	yes exactly
B	um similar strong female lead
A	yeah
B	and um two potential male love interests
A	yeah
B	er
A	who look like they would actually murder each other
B	well no but who
A	one gets a bit hairy at night
B	yeah
A	one's a bit pale
B	no she's finally a vampire now
A	I love that we're the same temperature
A	know what I mean
B	yes we've got markedly different thermal capacities
B	so therefore we contain different amounts of stored energy
A	yeah
A	oh my goodness
B	it was a bit unfortunate
A	I dunno
A	oh hilarious
A	yeah you no not in a cinema
A	yeah um apart from being quite Twightlighty it was good
B	yeah indeed it was
A	as in it wasn't all er while they had that element of it it wasn't all moony and kind of oh I love you
B	no it was very good
A	it was  it was  kind of and I mean is the interesting thing is as well that she's was she playing it? Was she doing it to survive? And what's gonna happen cos
B	no I don't think so because if she was doing it to survive she would have killed him at the end
A	no but I mean she could
B	no but she
A	yeah
A	she she could've not wanted him to die but she I mean she might not be in love with him
B	well no but that's quite a step to
A	no
B	I think you might be overthinking this a bit
A	I dunno
B	yes but no but she knew that she was going to survive even she knew she had better odds of survival if she didn't do that
A	I dunno
B	I think you're just
A	okay
B	completely taking that the wrong way
A	okay
B	it'd be far too boring if she wasn't
A	fair enough
B	no as in
A	no but I'm saying she maybe wasn't doing it just to survive
B	well then
A	and thought well I don't want this game to be like you know cos they said at the beginning um that if they could do something
B	yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	to make a stand
B	I know
A	no but I'm saying maybe she wasn't willing to die to not let the games win
B	yeah possibly
A	do it like that's the
B	probably not because she was very keen to get home to her sister
A	but I
A	I just wasn't convinced
B	well that's probably the acting
A	well yeah possibly
B	or the scripting
A	it was possibly just like yeah possibly slighty kinda
B	or the fact that you're not a teenager
A	maybe
B	in natality at least
B	no idea
A	mm
B	well I yeah cos I got that free sample of the first book in with the DVD awards thing
A	oh yes
A	was it
B	it seemed to be
A	yeah
B	yes
A	but I mean there's I used to read stuff like not maybe not stuff quite as dark as that but I used to read sort of teen fantasy type stuff quite a lot
A	but of course in a book you can  you can  er you can really either play it up make it quite graphic or you can play it down and just have them dying
B	well that was really played down
A	yep
A	yeah
B	what cos teenagers are quite horrible?
A	yeah
B	I find it difficult handling that idea
A	no but as in like
B	the people particularly it's particularly disturbing in the opening sequences as in people you were training you were
A	mm
B	sort of you know trying to kill like it's
A	yeah
B	your enemy becomes a uniform target
A	yes
B	in this particular case you know you get to know people you are going to try to kill
A	yeah that was what I found
B	it would impair
A	yeah
B	your ability to kill them
A	exactly
B	targets
A	yeah
B	yep
A	Cos yeah I just wouldn't be talking to
B	ah that leads me
A	but
B	to the next question
A	I think I would've been very quickly killed
A	oh yes
B	um
A	what were we saying?
B	the other thing you were saying was
A	oh yeah how how would I cope?
B	yeah
A	well I dunno
B	mm
A	yeah
B	that may have actually worked pretty well
A	yeah
B	well it would be difficult to search an area that large
A	yeah
B	definitely yeah
A	but would they have
B	you'd last for a few days
A	exactly
B	over a week without food
A	um but of course would they let you
B	this is true
A	which is the problem with any strategy
B	but
A	though they can
B	but I assumed that they'd leave it in as fair and I was surprised that they interfered because they'd think that would be unpopular
A	yeah yeah
B	mind you of course they're trying to make it interesting so it's just like reality TV
A	yeah exactly
A	sort of fiddling with it
B	er
A	yes
B	yes
A	mm
B	don't want to let your enemy come to you
A	well while she was up in the tree could she not have shot them?
B	yeah but she didn't have an arrow
A	oh she didn't have a bow and arrow at that point did she
B	no no that's right
A	yeah she really should've taken more opportunities
B	what guy? This was
A	um so when the they left the stuff all piled up and there was one guy left on guard
B	yes
A	she should've killed him
B	oh er
A	she
B	no
A	but yeah
B	er to take it to another extreme
A	mm
B	to help you
A	yeah
B	um so but leaving that aside I mean basic things so er the girl who died
A	yeah
B	food
A	well yeah indeed
B	yeah
A	but again that gesture may be made unpopular
B	you well it wouldn't have occurred to her but then that's why she's not
A	mm
A	mm
B	you should be
A	yeah
B	prepared to take advantage
A	in all fairness I mean the
B	no but no they wouldn't
A	mm
B	then that wouldn't that count in your favour
A	yeah
B	because that makes it entertaining
A	yeah
B	and unpredictable
A	yeah
B	that's why Out of the Question always worked well cos it's always not
A	yeah
B	or at least if it is it's
A	yeah
B	they are who you
A	so obvious
B	expect it to be
A	yeah
B	um
A	yeah
B	I speak sense
B	now I'm a little bit concerned about going back on the
A	oh okay
B	we'll see
A	mm
B	sorry?
A	I guess
B	yes
B	yes
B	ah
A	ah
B	anyway
A	yeah anyway
B	so how do you think I would've done?
A	I think you'd have won
B	it's er yeah
A	of survival plus strength
B	hunting
A	plus hunting
B	I'd have wanted a rifle
A	I don't think that's the idea
B	there's a
A	yeah
B	A handgun would've done
A	yep
B	er
A	mm
B	you never saw a gun out of the entire film
A	no
A	that's what I was just what I was thinking it was all bows and arrows and swords
B	no but even the enforcers didn't seem to have firearms
A	no
B	which I found kind of funny
A	yeah
B	I mean again there were a few other factors so I wouldn't I'm just thinking about them showing
A	mm
B	I would've if I'd been her I'd have cut my hair off very quickly
A	yep
B	um potentially used it as a bow string
A	yeah
B	um
A	it was interesting er I mean one thing that did irked me a little bit was that amazingly blended in rock thing
B	well if a rock was covered in a particular material it wouldn't be that difficult to
A	mm
B	oh shush
B	yes
A	right
B	so even if he was wounded that could've worked quite well
A	yeah
A	mm
B	anyway
A	yeah um
B	but needless to say
B	it wasn't me
A	no
B	well no but I
B	wouldn't want to end up killing children
A	fair enough
B	but that's the thing
A	yeah
B	actually hold on a second
A	no I know what you mean
B	this is quite sick
A	that's that's the thing with children
B	and that's why there's I think that works with children who are young enough not to think about what it actually means
A	but having said that though teenagers are quite capable of thinking about that kind of thing
B	no they're not
A	yeah
B	you're fighting to you know often for a country or to
A	yeah an ideology or
B	exactly
A	yeah
B	and there's something driving you
A	yeah
B	but here er you are killing in order to just to survive
A	yeah not
B	yep
A	I guess the I mean the idea is that it it kind of forces you to become an animal
B	yeah exactly
A	yeah
B	and
A	and I guess that's
B	no but but er I don't think unless you really make an active effort to put yourself in their shoes I don't I think it would be very easy to gloss over that film
A	mm
B	understood it
A	but
B	and
A	but I mean that's okay like
B	yeah but I'm not sure it's okay to I'm still not sure if it's an appropriate film for a appropriate film for that age range
A	really?
B	yeah
A	no but you could say that so you could say okay so Pirates of the Caribbean
B	no but not like
A	mm
B	um it's not just a setting and it's yeah disturbed
A	also a bit like Noughts and Crosses
B	sorry?
A	um have you do do you know Noughts and Crosses by Malorie Blackman?
B	no
A	um well it's a series of books
B	right
A	um and that's
B	oh I see what they did there with the noughts
B	yes but it's one thing to have people being killed
A	mm
B	and I think the fact that it was clean
A	yeah
A	ah it's probably your mum
B	are you sure? Right well I'll wait till we get there
A	yeah yeah sure
B	well we haven't got back
A	no exactly
B	that's entirely accurate
B	as soon as we get up to speed you can um pass me the phone
A	it's probably a voicemail
B	well whatever
A	yeah
B	no listen to it and then delete it
A	it said voice mailbox number
B	yeah should be
A	oh wow
B	okay
A	yeah it's it's not your mum
B	okay
A	one missed call
B	oh alright
A	do you wanna just leave it or?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
B	um
A	ah
B	so yes er film
A	yeah
B	yeah so
A	Good
B	that was fine just fine
A	mm
B	for far more sort of it was a brilliant concept for er could of been taken a lot further
A	mm
B	but in some ways
A	but that would be an entirely different book
B	yeah but it wasn't as in
A	but
B	like I said fundamentally disturbing thing was the concept
A	yeah
B	and the fact they chose not to go into that and to make it very simplistic didn't remove that threat or that menace
A	hm
B	the fact most people wouldn't be aware of
A	but yeah I mean you could've done that
B	well no it's the same story
A	mm
B	it's not
A	it's it's it's about markets
B	but that's the point
A	the teenage market
B	it isn't like that
A	possibly
B	I know and I understand what you're saying
A	actually
B	but it should I'm saying it shouldn't have been
A	no
B	because in reality I think it was actually virtually
B	no less disturbing like that
A	mm
B	but and therefore I don't know that it was really appropriate for that audience
A	I think twelve-year-olds are fine
B	no er you see I
A	I mean I say twelve-year-olds
B	but you see but
A	like fifteen-year-olds they could
B	yeah but okay so
A	er like sixteen-year-olds be seeing that as well
B	sh sh sh shut up for a minute
A	mm
B	as an adult who actually thinks about it in more depth than because when I was a child I just sort of glossed over
A	yeah
B	you start thinking actually you know in this scene you know ten people just got killed
A	yeah
B	and actually that's really disturbing and tragic
A	mm
B	but certainly for me if I'd watched that film when I was fifteen or I dunno twelve I would've found it much less odd than I do now
A	mm
B	and hence yet again like I said to you um they rely on the naivety of the audience to protect them from being disturbed
A	well that's a bit odd but aren't you also just presenting young minds with a very difficult situation to think about? Which surely is the point of the book to to give you something to think about? And I think that's quite a good thing to be thinking about
B	well I do
A	okay
B	I dunno
A	but that image struck with me and it I thought about it and it I grew up and thought about it
B	yes and all of what you're saying is completely true
A	mm
B	but
A	okay
[ANNOTATION]	The audience knows a lot about the topics.	Contradiction
B	very strange
A	okay well I mean think about the film Matilda
B	again
A	so
B	it's a far less disturbing concept
A	okay
B	yes I enjoyed it
B	tremendously
A	Good
B	just marred
B	I'd have said you shouldn't have it was brilliant
[ANNOTATION]	The person did not like the movie at all.	Contradiction
A	mm
B	yes well I think that's
A	well it's like Borat um not Borat um Bruno
B	why not?
B	mm
A	yeah do things
B	well to be fair it was very formulatic formulaic
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	The person has not seen Borat before.	Contradiction
B	and
A	and you can stick to it
B	mm some of it might be but yeah
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	The person is going to bail on it.	Contradiction
B	the boxes aren't subjective but the things that you are choosing for the boxes are
A	mm
A	I think that's a really fascinating topic actually
B	yes
A	and
B	mm
A	to mark the hundred years of it
B	well they were rating silent films
A	er nineteen twelve first talkie I believe was nineteen twelve
B	fuck
A	so where's he going?
[ANNOTATION]	The person really enjoys films.	Entailment
B	mm
A	er yeah
B	about that
A	about ten years ago
A	so it's a very old sign
[ANNOTATION]	The person has not seen a sign.	Contradiction
B	mm
A	I'm
B	no it's sensible except when you pointed out you know it made it very difficult for people with kids
A	mm
B	they didn't want to see the PGs
A	yeah
B	but
B	oh well
A	er
B	take that non-intuitive speed limit
B	just killing the beams because as we go over the hill
A	yeah
B	if we approach that
A	mhm
B	mm
A	so it's you know it's a bit violent but not horrendously so
B	yeah
A	um with Arnold Schwarzenegger
B	well all
A	well yeah true
B	yeah
A	I think even at the time
B	you see the first Lord of the Rings I can't believe that's a PG
A	yeah
B	that film disturbed me
A	first Lord of the Rings? I don't think you were that old cos I wasn't fifteen
B	er in that ballpark anyway
A	well I saw all of them before sixth form
B	I I don't actually care
A	okay
B	but it it
A	presumably it stayed
B	scared me
A	oh no it was very scary
B	the first one was by far the scariest
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	I thought was so strong in the first one
B	mm
A	but
B	sort of the idea er theme er split personality Golem
A	yeah
B	very strange
A	but that's the second film though
B	er
A	you er
A	but you don't really see Golem though
B	yeah yeah
A	until the second film
A	yeah I mean that's that's pretty bad yeah
B	what are we gonna do about food?
A	um do you wanna go and I mean
B	three quarters of an hour
A	mm
B	sorry?
A	it's pretty close
B	what are you talking about? Oh the cinema
A	the
B	it's only of the order of twice the time to get to
A	mm
B	slightly more but
A	yeah I mean
B	and of course there is no traffic at this time of night
A	no
A	yeah
B	particularly if one wasn't too bothered about speed limits
B	um
B	oh we could park on
A	oh
B	the double yellow lines outside
B	living dangerously
A	might be a policeman hiding somewhere
B	er I was gonna say the police will have nothing better to do tonight
A	yeah
B	so
A	no
B	um
A	did yeah do you wanna go and see if that's open?
B	er
A	domino's is probably midnight
B	do you know we could just park outside Domino's
A	yeah and walk up
B	um
B	I might like a bit of something savoury
A	yeah
B	actually yeah
A	I I wouldn't mind something to eat
B	mm
A	if you want
B	not very appetizing
B	I wouldn't
A	pff
B	could you possibly signal?
A	wow
B	that's just
B	it's just
A	is just insane
B	I wish when it was blatantly obvious what you were doing
B	Christ
B	yeah well I'd beat myself up if I realized that I'd missed a signal that would've been marginally beneficial to someone
B	well let's not make it sound like it was tailgating him
A	no no but I mean er you were blatantly there
B	but might not of
A	he might not yeah he maybe he was just signalling out of habit at the point he normally signals
B	there was literally zero point in that signal
A	no
B	er so what looks open?
A	okay
B	domino's?
A	domino's looks like it could well be open
[ANNOTATION]	Dominos could be open	Entailment
B	I'd be surprised if they are shut
A	what Fish and Chicken?
B	maximum stay four hours
A	probably manage yeah
B	right
