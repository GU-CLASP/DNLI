A	no
D	well I do every time I go out I walk around

[ANNOTATION]	they are not sure about carriage again see or not	Neutral
A	I couldn't believe it though and I just thought why would you want? why would you
A	yeah but you know like
C	oh
A	you just think they could've there's er even if they wanted to talk about that they could've done it in hushed tones they could've kind of but they weren't they were like they were basically shouting it to the whole carriage and I'm just like
B	wahey
D	but
B	wahey
D	what about all this stuff going on at the moment?
C	tacky
D	about all these leaks that go on
[ANNOTATION]	they are not sure about leaks	Entailment

C	what leaks?
B	who do you wanna see naked?
D	er
B	just go just go and have a look
D	well you know fine
B	I'm not I'm not
B	okay so my phone
A	basically er a
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about school	Contradiction
C	mm
A	a lot of celebrities' nude photos are appearing on the internet
C	oh right
A	and they're private photos that they have taken themselves to share with close
C	right
B	yeah my my phone can sync to the Icloud
C	right
B	mine isn't dunno why but it isn't erm and if you take a picture it automatically uploads there and it's stored privately
C	oh yeah
B	for you
D	it's we
B	there's a bug in it er
C	mm
B	er there was a bug in it and people exploited it and
B	found all these nude pictures of celebrities and just pictures of whatever and it's just all online now
D	er just not not all at once they
A	oh yeah and they but the thing is they clearly like they clearly spent quite some time collecting all of these images and er
A	it is it is quite funny because you
A	there is a part of me that's a bit like if you take those kind of photos
B	oh
A	you are opening up
C	course you are yes
A	even if
B	yeah very illegal
A	it would've been it would have been just as easy for somebody they'd sent them to to make them publicly available you kind of put yourself in a fairly vulnerable position
C	yes
A	if you're gonna take photos like this
C	yes
A	but some
D	however don't I look good?
A	yeah well that's the thing some some people are like
A	yeah
B	like this is er this is er way beyond erm like acceptable this is totally illegal er it's whatever er the
C	mm
B	the guy who's just been put in charge of I can't remember what it is it's something to do with European laws to to around this stuff
C	uhu
B	I can't remember what his title is erm he seems er quite seems to be quite out of sync with all this technology
C	yeah
D	mm
B	he basically turned round and called all these celebrities idiots
C	mm
D	that is it
B	very publicly which I think is
D	actually he's absolutely right
B	but it is very much
D	it is
B	illegal and should never have happened
C	mm
B	you wouldn't just turn round and say that
D	he actually just said
A	no but have you
A	er a group of celebrities
A	are now suing Google though did you see?
B	what for?
A	erm because Google er
A	no no no the yeah basically they're claiming that Google didn't do enough in the
C	to protect them
A	to well no not to to protect them but when when they got leaked they could've actually helped basically stop people being able to search it
C	uhu
A	but actually what they did do was make loads of of money off the fact that everybody was searching for nude photos
C	right
A	so now a load of celebrities are saying well actually
B	you're distributing illegal
A	Google yeah Google Google could've helped the situation they did not they would rather have made money off it
A	so they're in the wrong because they're helping distribute
C	yes yes circulate
D	brilliant
A	but it
D	and now the celebrities are
D	because they were stupid enough to put their nude photographs out there
C	mm
D	Google didn't stop it so they can be
C	mm
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	some people will benefit from it
C	oh oh you've got a little bit of food there
B	oh yeah
C	that side yeah that's it
B	it's just a little bit
C	yep there we are
B	a little bit
C	was would you like a pudding?
A	oh
A	I'm really sore and I don't know why
B	what the fuck is this?
D	alright darling

B	erm well it didn't cut out he hung up on me
A	oh
B	he er
D	yes
B	so the planners had already well the the local council had said oh we were gonna we're we're gonna disregard that complaint already erm but we were gonna refuse your planning because
C	anyway
B	anyway because of oh oh I've just driven past
D	have you
C	it's being denied
D	have you agreed with him? cos you don't know any other
C	well I agree with him that they're being
B	you agree with anyone you agree with Daily Mail non-stop
C	they they they're being blocked
D	I am now
C	they're being blocked and this
D	I am now reading The Daily Telegraph
B	it's not like it's brown
C	no but all the same
B	she's not a chartered surveyor
C	she is a chartered surveyor
D	she is
B	she's chartered?
C	she's chartered
D	mm
B	how's she chartered?
C	through her degree
B	I thought she had a masters in
C	she has yeah
D	she has
B	really?
C	she is qualified though
B	doesn't mean she's chartered
C	think she is
D	I'm sure she's doing that now
C	oh is it?
B	cos now she's with graduates
C	oh well she will be er she will be chartered but he was saying
B	she will be
C	that he'd have a chartered accountant in the village who could help with parish issues
C	you'd have a chartered surveyor in time
A	I didn't do anything
C	in the village who could help with say things like getting planning through for portacabins for schools and things like that
C	and they're excluding people like that from the village
B	yeah what about it?
C	well they should be encouraging people like that into the village
B	I don't think they care
C	they don't do they?
B	no erm so what
B	was that your that was your point?
C	yeah
B	oh I thought you were gonna say something about why they were blocked
D	they were blocked because they can't
C	cos they'd made their mind up that they weren't going to
D	because because the
C	on strike said to
D	to
C	mm
D	you'll never build anything around here I'll have you at every step
C	I'll make sure you don't
D	he's
B	really?
C	yeah he said it forty years ago I'll always block any building cos he was jealous of
C	yeah
D	he was a little
D	every time there was the bit of oh there's a fly in our tea everybody out
C	on strike at the quarries
A	I don't necessarily think it's a bad thing though
B	yeah I think it's probably a good thing let's face it
D	though
B	we were trying to explain to we
B	and we had to draw a map of how close it was and she was just like oh oh well that must be really awkward for him and we were like no he loves it it's
C	mm
C	but they're not but what the
B	yeah I know but
C	mm
D	we're not gonna get involved
B	no
C	no we mustn't get involved
D	I've already offered him
C	he asked if he could if he could build
C	he's joking he was joking I said no
D	and you could have
B	probably could
D	you could have one sorry he asked for three you there's only four
C	well we're not here no you can't
D	don't we got a letter from him
B	about what?
C	oh
D	we mustn't
C	because
A	that's not you anyway is it?
B	did you reply with I have no access to your land?
D	no he didn't he it was a nine a two thousand and eight letter with two thousand and eight crossed out copy of it crossed out in two thousand and fourteen in a used envelope and it was slit open
D	and the address didn't fit whatever and just scrawled across the front Mr and Mrs
C	but I knew
D	and it was shoved through the door while I was
D	I heard him
C	but he said we
D	the funny thing was it
B	oh wait er so so who got?
C	they all they all got in two thousand and eight
B	mm yeah yeah yeah cos he
D	and all of a sudden signs went up everywhere and everybody
C	got a letter
D	everybody down
C	mm
D	and
C	she doesn't even back onto it
D	she doesn't even back and she
B	mm
D	and so I've got the same letter again from photocopied and it's from his solicitors not from him with the date of two thousand and eight crossed out and two thousand and fourteen written in ink shoved in an envelope that was obviously from a bank or a building society you know with a window
B	yeah
D	so it was open shoved in with our name Mr and Mrs
A	thought that was the cat
C	where is he? no it's
D	er and
C	mm
D	and er it's the
D	it's the people cos he won't clear around the stile to keep the access clear so somebody else has cut it back and dumped it in the ditch
C	yeah
B	really?
C	mm
D	and I've met the guy who and
C	so that people can get through
D	and he used to meet him
C	go and get your inhaler
D	no I haven't got an inhaler love I don't have an inhaler
C	your er your zappy thing
D	that's different
A	well he's he's not doing himself any favours because if he'd have been if he'd have approached the whole situation a lot better a few years ago people would've been kind of
D	no no
D	it's not that no no no
A	is it?
D	what he needs to do is just spend some money
B	yeah he needs to cut his boundaries
D	and he needs to go back and halfway along this bank or two-thirds of the way along this boundary at the back of the bungalows there is
B	a gate
D	a gate double gate with it's er a house plot with so it's as wide as from here to there
A	so wait he's sent you all letters telling you to fix your boundaries rather than trying to get him to pay his own?
D	no yeah er no no no no no sorry no no no
D	you've got the field you've got the big field there at the back
A	yeah
D	there is from the stile across to a stile
A	yeah
D	from the footpath opposite side of the field
B	far side stile
C	yeah
D	right far side
A	yeah
B	yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	no I get I get what you're trying to say
B	yeah yeah
D	okay
A	but the
D	no no no no no no no no do the
D	oh you can't you can't then there's a boundary fence across there at the back of the bungalows
C	uhu
D	which goes onto our back boundary here and every single bungalow across there
B	has a gate
D	has a gate into the field
C	they put them in themselves
D	they all did it themselves not allowed
C	not the builder
D	there's no they broke through the fence that was there so they could go into the field
D	not allowed there's no access they're not allowed to
C	mm
D	right in the middle there is er one plot worth left and there was double gates across there and they've fallen apart
C	uhu
D	and although there's signs saying there's no public
B	and all over town
C	yeah
D	and of course people are using it for walking and whatever so what he's written to is everybody along the boundary here saying you you're not allowed to access from your property onto my property close your gates off or I'll prosecute you're also not allowed to tip your garden waste in my field
C	mm
D	there's only one person does it next door but two who dumps it right in the corner here of my garden and
C	and
D	and he dumps er dumps it there so the farmer comes along and blames me
C	and
D	and
C	the old boy
D	who's eighty
A	but does if you guys don't tell him how does he know?
D	well we do tell him
D	I've told him
C	he's never here he lives in
D	he lives with the other side of
B	north of
C	and
C	but he won't come here and talk to
D	which seriously
D	there was not a single person walked their dog there was no worn footpath at the back er along our
B	yeah that's all only ten years old maybe
C	mm
A	so what
D	no no no no no you've missed
B	there's two there's two
A	oh okay
D	it's it's from there to there
B	it's from it's from this stile to that stile
C	yeah
D	or from there to there
A	oh okay
D	but people now walk all the way round the field
A	mm
C	mm
B	there's er
A	yeah
D	and
D	and then there's a diagonal
D	and just whatever
B	because obviously that impacts the person who leases it for hay
D	hay
C	mm
D	however and this is what I would really like and I I can't remember it there was a it was on countrywatch Countryfile
C	yeah
D	and it was a farmer who had got suddenly hit with this notice about his field
B	was it about the footpaths?
C	yeah
B	yeah
D	about about people dog walking
C	yeah
D	and he said look they've done this and he's got a
B	yeah
D	and he said there's no public footpaths there's no nothing and all of a sudden it's become
D	somebody applied to make it common land
C	land yeah
A	there's also people going back to like plans from like hundreds of years ago
B	yeah
A	and saying oh
D	ah no this is where yeah
A	this used to be a bridleway so now it has to
B	yeah
A	and like there was er the one on Countryfile then was
D	this
A	it was a courtyard wasn't it?
B	it was in the middle of a farm yeah
D	yeah exactly
A	and they they were allowed to go straight through the courtyard of the farm
D	ah well exactly well the
B	middle of middle of this
A	yeah
C	mm
D	course the funniest one is when you go out
B	yeah
D	before you get to
D	there's a public footpath
C	there's a footpath because
D	if you follow that and if you follow it the
C	yeah
A	I took you to
B	yeah the one that there's a walk in
A	and you walk straight through you walk
C	yeah
B	but it is very much in their
A	but it's er it's clearly private land
B	yeah
A	and then you have to walk across their driveway
D	yeah
A	through another paddock
C	wow
A	like
B	mm
A	cos that's just the public footpath
D	but that's how it is
D	but the thing is here
A	but they've put they've put on you know like they've put up like little you know like stakes with er
B	yeah but there's er there's signs and stuff
A	yeah
B	and er it's very much you stick with the path
C	mm
D	but you see the the again looking at it when you work backwards if you go right the way back to to
B	yeah
D	that's where it was the end of the town this was a big camp
B	yeah
D	it was a labour camp
B	it was yeah
D	in the old days er and er orchards but there has always been a route from
D	that ran through here and carried on up over the hill just where it is now in the woods
C	yeah
D	and when they built the estate that's why the public footpath's there
B	yeah
C	yeah that was the main road yeah
A	mm
D	because that has always been there they've had to divert it
C	mm
D	to get through the estate
C	cos I've always
B	technically it should just go straight through
C	yeah
D	er straight line
C	it does technically yeah I've always said to your dad we should have er a metal detector on the er there the back of the garden cos there could be anything
D	you wouldn't believe the amount of rubbish I've thrown on the back there that's metal nails nails nails nails air gun pellets air gun pellet air gun pellet air gun pellet
B	really?
C	mm
B	it's
C	are you feeling man enough to?
C	mm?
D	but I can't
C	mm?
B	just the last one I did was a bit of a
D	erm so yeah
B	it took a took a while
D	so it's a bit awkward at the moment
B	a few shots
A	mm
B	it was right at the back
C	yeah
A	it's all part of the fun
D	because I don't want anybody walking past the garden because we've taken the hedge out and it's thinning because nobody should be walking there
D	and next door
C	we've gone nimby I think we're officially nimbys now
C	not in my back yard
D	not in my back yard
D	now I thought I
B	oh apple pie? apple pie apple pie
E	wahey
D	when it when er when they lost the chance of planning permission I thought of
D	but I reckon it's gonna cost me the best part of
B	what's this? what are you buying?
D	the field
B	yeah it'll cost you a bit that will won't it?
D	and I reckon I mean acreage wise I know what it should be er and what it's worth I know what it could be
B	would he er would he have to know it was you?
D	no
B	would you do it anonymously?
D	not
B	yeah
D	no
B	but not to him
D	it's probably worth about a million million and a half
B	yeah
D	to build on that
B	mm maybe even more it's quite a decent size
D	yeah I know
A	it's yeah way more than that
B	yeah
D	yeah but er but yeah but
B	oh is that to
D	no that was
D	that's without permissions that was just a
B	tell you what you want on there
D	there's no permissions on it
B	you want some bungalows on there
D	but
B	oh er
D	but
A	no they are moving
C	are they?
B	they are moving
D	where are they going?
A	they've bought a little chalet over
B	like
C	oh
C	oh yes yes yes yes down there?
B	yeah
C	more central
B	they're gonna yeah
A	well erm it sounds like it needs some work doing but basically they're they're downsizing but not actually downsizing so
A	they're selling their current house pocketing
A	pocketing the difference basically
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	and hoping that'll mean that erm
B	so they're selling their three-bed family-size bungalow
B	same size as grandma's really
C	yeah
B	erm yeah er same size as
D	dad do you want er a drop more?
E	I'm alright
D	you're alright? okay
B	same same size as grandma's
C	mm
D	grandpa's okay grandpa's okay
B	okay same size as grandma's really
C	mm
B	erm
C	wow
B	and they're gonna get a thing a bit like the ones up the road that is a potential three-bed but but probably two-bed
C	okay uhu
B	or was it a four-bed?
A	four-bed
C	mm
C	but one of the bedrooms is downstairs so it's more likely to be like a snug
