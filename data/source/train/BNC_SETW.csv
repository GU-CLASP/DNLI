B	oh always put it on
A	ha ha
B	well it's another five minutes
A	because I  Because I  have gotta fill out a form and stuff which well is pointless if it's just a minute
B	oh right okay
A	and there is a relatively mm well you know there is a it's not an insignificant amount of admin for each recording so
B	right
A	yeah I'll um
B	subject waiting in petrol station forecourt
B	yeah
A	I'd like to talk about some fly-tipping huh ha
B	yeah that would be worth it
A	yeah
B	well no you could say first thing we need would be for you to put a bollard in

B	couldn't we
A	if they're dragging their feet
B	look I'd ring the site office first
A	right okay
B	oh my
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B would email the site office	Contradiction
A	ha ha
B	look behind you love
B	she's going out the
A	surely you can get round that side
B	I have no idea
A	probably not where there are pumps
B	how much would you like an open top car today?
A	that would be cool
B	yes
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B doesn't have an idea	Entailment
A	or I'd end up with sort of like a fright wig
B	I think that's a relative term
A	hmm mm
B	oh dear yes
A	it would be quite cool
B	as someone with a sense of humour comedy recently it's it would just be nice if with bearing in mind the sort of like eighty percent of the price of fuel is actually tax
[ANNOTATION]	Seventy percent of the fuel price is tax	Contradiction
A	mm
B	oh well the special thing is you actually pay VAT on the fuel duty
B	um
A	you pay tax on the tax?
B	yes
A	that makes sense
B	yeah sort of
A	it must be quite disconcerting having that guy sitting on his bike watching you fill up
[ANNOTATION]	It must be disconcerting having that guy sitting on his bike watching you fill up a police report	Neutral
B	oh well we'll watch him fill up
A	I'm waiting
B	the good news is he'll be quick
A	yes he will be quick
B	no
A	he might do
B	to be fair you shouldn't
[ANNOTATION]	He will be quick with washing his car	Neutral
A	oh hang on
B	no
A	no okay
B	oh right
A	or can you not do that?
B	no you can't do that
A	oh right okay
B	to be fair you shouldn't bike in jeans
A	why? Cos if you come off you'll break your legs
B	no um
A	mm
B	it takes leather a long time to burn through
A	yeah
B	see the reinforced patches on the elbows?
A	yeah
B	that's cos it that's what hits the ground if you
A	yeah and
B	the impact won't kill you
A	the slide will take your skin off
B	it will well you'll burn
A	right
B	A massive friction
B	and yeah it will just rip through flesh
A	yeah
B	well the point of leathers is that leather is very tough
A	mm
B	it's got a
A	in science in primary school
B	yeah
A	and leather you can't make a scratch on
B	er I'm not sure you can do that love
A	presumably it just won't let her get the fuel out
B	uh
A	some people are just really really impatient aren't they?
B	yeah apparently
A	ooh he's gonna be pissed off if it's double his cost cos of what she's been getting out
B	I don't see how that's working
A	it's not
B	you idiot
A	worked it out yet? Come on
B	wow
A	ah
B	Jesus
A	presumably he's trying to park
B	are we about to be ram raided or something?
A	he's making heavy weather of it isn't he?
B	oh
A	ah right
B	that was er one of the more special things I've seen yeah
A	look
B	the problem is that it's a
A	put it back
B	I think what's confusing here is there's two sets of pumps on each thing
A	now now now wait
B	oh
A	zero
B	now if you look cos there is four options
A	yeah
B	so there's four points but they're in sets of two
A	yeah
B	so I think
A	so she's assuming that
B	I guess he looks quite nice
A	doesn't he
B	sort of huggable
A	and that's great because he didn't need to move forwards to refuel
B	exactly
A	so it's actually quicker yeah
B	it saved a huge amount of time
A	yeah it was good
B	yeah cos as soon as the other chap paid he could er
A	mm
B	get on with it
A	Good stuff
B	erm but you
A	bikers are often quite nice aren't they?
B	yeah tend to be unless they're like
A	yeah scary bikers
B	well unless they're sort of American style Hell's Angels type
A	wild Hogs
B	yeah
A	it's a bit embarrassing
B	erm er the sex wasn't it the er erm er you know in films
A	yeah
B	er a group of Hell's Angels at an orgy
A	I don't understand
B	it was just a joke about the fact that the sex is the only integral part of the story
A	oh okay
B	I dread to think
A	some kind of survey
B	yes
A	oh no I can't imagine
B	oh I can see it possibly
