C	it was a nightmare
D	in summer it was or it wasn't a motorway it was just the A38
C	yeah
D	but it was clogged all the way to Birmingham so I came cut through
C	oh my goodness

C	yeah
D	anyway as I was two two hours later I thought well I've
C	mm
D	blown it anyway
C	have I been here before?
D	I
D	you know I wasn't used to drinking in those or drinking whisky in those days
C	and it's been downhill ever since then

B	gosh
C	but with kids' help and it was brilliant
B	that's amazing
C	and we stayed there for three years
B	cor you

C	it's sunshine you get you go up to
D	yes
A	yes
D	yes absolutely
C	and you're in fog
D	yeah
A	mm
C	that was the only disadvantage the water was fed from a spring that used to travel over ground
D	mm
C	and if a leaf got in the sort of entrance to the pipe into the tank there was no water
C	so we had to go traipsing up through the fields about a mile away and then sort out the leaves push them to one side
C	we got immune to it
B	yeah you would do
C	those were the days
B	those were the days yeah
D	it's didn't that
C	he he did yeah
D	cos
D	had to go and sort of cut him down

D	mm
C	and someone on the staff at the school said I've just looked this cottage in north
C	and as soon as somebody says to me it needs a lot of work doing on it my ears prick up
B	yes
C	I think ooh
B	it's a challenge
C	it's a challenge
B	yeah
D	mm
C	so we bought it basically it was just a little cottage
A	and that's where the
C	that's where the
A	mm
D	mm
C	and we extended it four times
C	till we built on the boundary of the
D	mm
C	any more
B	so you you do the planning and the building do you?
C	mm
B	you do oh that's very good
C	drew the plans yeah
B	mm
D	well when did you move to erm where you are now?
C	well the funny thing then was
D	mm
C	erm it was there was
A	mm
C	there was
A	I don't know
C	north
A	I know
C	there was erm who used to live in
A	oh erm
D	no
C	no
D	no er
C	no no after
A	oh
C	yeah
C	after
D	er oh
A	or
D	not er no
C	er he was a radiologist

A	oh yes
D	yes er
A	with the wife erm
C	yeah
D	yes
A	and they went down to live at
C	yes
D	yeah
C	and
A	yeah
C	now he lives back in

C	erm
A	oh god
C	what were their names?
A	oh don't erm
B	go through the alphabet
C	they've got three boys haven't they?
A	yeah
D	yes yeah
A	I remember when they were young those boys
D	they demolished our dam actually
C	there was
A	did they?
C	oh right anyway
D	anyway yeah
C	erm
A	it'll come to us
C	the book group was at her house
A	right
A	no
D	no
C	no
C	it's started a bell
D	it's coming it's coming it's
A	mm
C	the book group meeting was at her house and she just threw into the conversation as you do cos they never discuss books at book groups do they?
C	no erm she just said oh the barn's up for sale again and
D	mm
C	so the you know the middle of the night
D	and you made a fantastic
A	oh I know the history the bit you've forgotten is when between
C	oh my god yeah
A	while you were doing it up you were living at
C	you're absolutely right she was round the back
A	and I came
B	oh you were neighbours?
C	we were
A	we were and I'd come home
C	and that's how I met you
A	to have a
C	yeah
A	baby which
B	what that would have been years ago
A	that was
C	well the funny thing is we were simultaneously with looking at this barn
D	yes mm
C	and we'd done the drawing and
D	oh yeah
C	we'd have to put the
D	yeah
C	you know the er furniture into and she said come and live with us
C	and ask
B	where was that?
C	she went back
B	and you were there as well at that
A	my mum was there yeah
C	just just afterwards yeah
A	yes
A	well done
C	erm the phone went
A	what was his name?
D	that hasn't come back yet
C	the phone went in about ten minutes and she said yeah
B	mm
C	so we did and then she said there's just one condition
D	mm
C	and how long will that be? and I said between twelve months and two years probably
D	mm
C	that's fine while you're living here can you draw up plans
B	forty-seven rooms?
C	mm
B	bloody hell it's like a palace
C	so they've got like they've got you know
D	mm
C	yeah do you know I went up into the attic there and it hadn't changed from the day that the army were barracked there
C	and the name
A	really?
C	of the officers was still on the doors in the attack
A	really?
D	good lord
C	they poured
D	mm
C	why? have a guess
D	insulation
C	mm
A	sound proofing
C	from
D	yeah
C	would make a lot of noise and they would wear the wood away
D	oh yeah
C	but they never actually took the concrete up again when they left so
D	bloody hell that must have been heavy
C	yeah
D	mm
C	so you've got
A	so has it been removed now?
D	concrete
C	in part well yeah because it started to break up
D	mm
C	and they've also converted it into holiday homes
D	mm crickey
C	but the kids our kids used to have parties up there and of course it was like so spooky
C	cos everyone thought it was a strange thing when I was drawing the plans up there was a discrepancy in the height of the rooms
D	mm
C	cos I measured the outside of the building
D	mm
C	and then measured the rooms inside and there was like five feet one and a half metres
D	blimey
C	gone astray somewhere
C	the building outside was one and a half metres higher than the rooms inside
A	really?
C	and we I tailed it back and sure enough there was a fire
D	mm
C	one and a half metres deep
D	you found it
C	yeah
D	mm
C	and that was the discrepancy
A	and why?
B	why?
C	well in those days because the ceilings were so heavily moulded with plasterwork and whatever it was a suspended ceiling you couldn't have walked on the same joists that were holding the ceiling up because it would vibrate and the plaster would
D	crikey
C	crack off so they had separate joists for the floor upstairs than the joists holding the plasterwork ceiling
B	mm
D	god
C	it was a
A	so you would only get that in big fancy houses you wouldn't get that in more simple
C	I'm not sure
A	buildings?
D	is it still
C	no no
D	it's still like that now?
C	oh yeah yeah nothing's changed
D	mm
A	so you could hide all sorts of things there
C	you could
D	crikey
C	very interesting
B	mm
D	where did you meet
C	at college
D	oh
C	we were erm
A	where were you doing that
C	it was at
A	were you at
C	yeah
A	cos I was at
C	oh
A	and then
C	do you know she still
C	there are nine of them right? they're all girls and they're all still on their first marriage
D	wow
A	mm heaven for you
B	it's interesting that isn't it?
D	it is
C	I'm not sure what the statistic or
B	it's
A	no
C	no it's both wasn't it? er
B	was it at one time all women cos
A	well maybe in the past
B	I think yeah
A	I didn't spend a lot of time there really
C	well I was in
A	I lived in
C	oh
B	because I think when I
C	you must have lived near us then
A	mm
C	we lived in
A	well I spent three years there
C	mm
B	I was at a teacher's training college in
A	mm
B	and that was all male until the last year
A	until your wife came along
B	when I met my wife
C	mm
B	and my you know but that's another story
C	and you met her at college?
B	that's another story I met her at college yeah but
C	how funny
B	it didn't quite work out but anyway that's another story
A	was it?
B	yeah and
C	well there was another sister college
B	er er
C	in
A	was there?
C	mm
A	mm
B	so so we we used to have dances with
A	mm
C	oh
B	so we missed each other by about five years dear
A	yeah I know
C	but
B	caught up in the end
C	you made it in the end
A	could have been a different story
B	quite yeah could have been
B	could have been
C	how funny
A	what year were you at
C	sixty-six sixty-nine
A	ah I was there seventy to seventy-three
C	mm
A	cos then it came under
C	you just missed out on
D	yeah
A	until it broke to pieces cos then my sister in law went and trained there
C	how funny
A	well
A	no
C	my colleague at er university erm because I I recently just retired from lecturing at the university of
A	fully circle
C	yeah full circle and
A	oh right
C	mm
A	mm
C	small world
A	small world
B	what goes around comes around
C	absolutely and you you trained in
D	no I trained in
C	oh right
D	I live in
C	mm
D	and at the time
C	mm yeah
D	so as we didn't have that much
A	it still is isn't it?
D	yes
C	mm
D	at
C	my brother in law
D	oh right yeah
C	is that right?
D	yes
C	would that that be right?
D	yeah it could be yeah yeah
C	mm
D	yeah erm
C	it's is the it's the same course for dentistry and orthodontics or
D	no
C	right
D	in those days and then it was very much a post graduate thing
C	ah right
D	which I did get into because post graduate education was really good down in the
C	yeah
D	had a chap called
C	mm
D	they had to be drinking holes
C	ah
D	so he always used to er and
C	sounds very sans
D	he always used to organise it
B	thank you
D	and we used to go to places like the
A	mm
D	claim this on expenses
C	oh
D	I mean you know the taxman would allow you to go
A	yeah
C	yeah
D	on an official post graduate course so we
C	hospitality
D	yes possibly
C	mm
D	erm it was quite an interesting really cos after a few years of touring round all the
C	mm
D	the good the good restaurants in those days
C	tax free
D	get us and sorted too
D	he said well you you have to pay but you can
C	who's listening to this? I hope it's not the taxman
D	you you you can you you can
C	right yeah
D	cos they wanted to get people into post graduate education
C	mm
D	anyway he came back to and and he said well I've done a bit of research he said and it's quite pricey a weekend anywhere in the UK but
C	oh
D	we get if we go to Athens
D	Athens in November
C	to
D	we can have six days there
C	for the same price
D	for the same price
B	yeah
D	so is anybody up for that?
A	really?
D	well I think I was
C	well
D	the only bloke from
C	oh
D	but we met a load of people
C	did anyone say
D	that
C	no I'm not up for it? I can't imagine it
D	no I can't take the time I can't afford that no way oh I'm not going on a post graduate course
C	really?
D	yeah
C	oh
D	the only trouble was I forget which year it was but it was the year of one of the one of the er when the generals took over
C	mm
D	and the first night we got there
A	sixty-eight probably
D	this chap who was organising it he he'd he had been happily married in
D	and he nursed her through her finals
A	a bit of an affair
D	but anyway when he
C	I like that he nursed her through her finals
D	it it turned out we we
D	we went we went on this this thing and he did actually he told me he said well actually I'm on my honeymoon so
C	oh my god
D	said come on alright and he was in the room the bedroom next to us and during the night
D	banging and great crashing
D	I'm
D	anyway
C	oh
D	there was this you know the generals had taken over
C	oh I see
B	the
D	and we what we'd heard was tanks going through the streets
D	and they were still going the next morning and we looked out you know and they were going over cars it was very impressive see a tank goes over
C	meanwhile
D	goes over traffic lights and cars
C	meanwhile in the bedroom next door
D	just flattened yes
C	he was still going
D	but the Americans thought the
B	concentration
D	oh god it was the end of the world
D	whereas we were you know dentists and we could well this there was a guard armed guard on the door but he was a nationalist serviceman who wanted to improve his Englishman er English
D	so he said well yeah just gonna you can walk up the street but don't don't go too far else you might get shot but of course you know they'd er and it was all really quite peaceful until we realised that the barman
C	they've written a song
D	couldn't get at the
C	they've written a song about that
D	yeah but in fact
C	there's nothing so morbid loathsome or drear than to stand at the bar of a pub with no beer
D	with no beer
C	yeah
D	but dentists being dentists there's always there's a resourceful bloke
D	who can pick locks
C	crikey
D	the first two the first two days we weren't supposed to leave the hotel but we did and then after that it was sort of quite happening because the I think everybody realised it was going to be a better regime
C	did you actually
D	the one that took over
C	did you actually do any business you know
D	well not a lot because we were supposed to be based on the university
D	we were going in the university dental school
C	oh
D	to do the thing you see
C	but you couldn't get there
D	but we couldn't get there so we did have lectures in the
C	yeah
D	in the
C	in the hotel
D	in the hotel yeah
B	so were you in Greece then dear?
A	no cos you're talking sixty-seven sixty-eight
