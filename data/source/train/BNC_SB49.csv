A	okay so what do you think of
B	I was really impressed I thought it was going to a bit scraggedy and I didn't think that it would have the fantastic view that it's got and I thought that the erm garden and the meadow was superb I thought the way that it was
A	and what well how did you feel about all their furnishings and everything cos I thought that everything being standardised like that I didn't know if that was a good operate or a bad operate cos it was a bit homogeneous in a way but then on the other hand it looked very clean and neat and and usable
B	I didn't mind it being homogeneous at all I thought it's actually quite sensible to just go through the shops and buy a house
A	mm
B	and a good
A	yeah but that's like our house that's like our normal house that we live in now not like a holiday cottage
B	not well no
A	goodness what our holiday cottage would be like it'd be like your granny's house
B	well exactly
A	a health asset
B	I don't think my granny's house would be a health asset she
A	your mum said it was a health asset
A	yeah but she would
B	can't be that much of a health asset erm and my granddad lived till ninety-four as well erm
A	but and the relevance of that is what?
B	that actually I do quite like sets of things in order imagine what you do is to go and buy different sets of crockery every week
A	no
B	I don't think they use that tone of voice no
B	that's
A	it still got your granny's lace making things inside it I'm not I'm not
B	yeah I know
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker's B grandfather lived until 100 years old	Contradiction
A	a funny
B	but the at
A	is it?
B	yes it is it is
A	no it's all it's all er taped sofas and and
B	no it's not
A	and sail cloth walls and
B	no the sitting
A	it is
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A mentions something about taped sofas	Entailment
B	the sitting room upstairs for example's got some global IKEA bookcases and then some BILLY bookcases
A	and a pink carpet
B	and a pink carpet
A	but nobody ever goes in there
B	no well we don't even
[ANNOTATION]	Both speakers mention the exact same thing for the pink carpet	Entailment
A	and actually those chairs those two chairs are now down in
B	I know er I think actually that the
A	oh when
B	yes
A	as if nobody usually sat in that chair
B	and she didn't say that she said oh I see you've you've managed to make use of the chair is what she said
A	well that also suggests that it's not been made use of
B	they
[ANNOTATION]	The chair was big and red	Neutral
A	do you think it was a marital?
B	almost certainly
A	do you think so?
B	not a proper one they don't I think they're quite content with each other at the moment I don't think
A	mm ah
B	why are you doing all this dirty lining washing in front of all these people?
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B is not very sure	Contradiction
A	no I'm not no it's just no I'm interested in what you think and I was just saying to
B	well
A	why until I why am I here?
B	but the question
A	or else I'd forget about it and I would say oh my goodness it cost me so much money and why
B	but I think the question is I think the question is why do you want it what do you want it for
A	well she could have new friends
A	no but I think we also had the debate when we said well you could go somewhere different every time and actually it might be a bit constricting to have to go somewhere to the same place every time and that actually you might want to have a look at the country because and you know and go to different places like when we did all those cottages in the south-east of England that we were going to different cottages each time
B	we were
A	and they were perhaps only ten or fifteen miles distant from each other but we saw something different and went to different places each time
B	but then
A	and we didn't we weren't
A	is that only a pound a time then?
B	it's a thousand pounds a time
B	but it's
B	well yeah but they've done it most weekends for the last forty years
A	really? most weekends?
B	a lot of weekends
A	is that true?
A	really?
B	they go there a lot
A	mm
B	as they're older than mum he's older
A	yes he is older
B	yeah so he's in his mid-eighties or his early eighties
A	mm
B	so they've been going there for forty years I I
A	no no it's er devils on horseback
B	okay
A	he's making devils on horseback erm yes okay well erm
B	well she's she's not eighty she's
A	no she's not eighty yet
B	she's seventy-eight erm
A	but he's he's a few years older than her
B	I mean yeah she's seventy-eight
A	oh is that? oh hang on a second that party when was that last party? was that his eightieth? his eightieth and
B	fiftieth
A	fiftieth
B	yeah
A	mm
B	that was last year
A	I mean er would you go to oh er I can't I can't imagine I would I think I would just end up feeling
B	well from
A	well at least they were on the west hand side of London
B	yeah
A	you know it's not the they haven't they're not starting out from
B	mm
A	but erm er I think I would end up I would end up feeling that it was a chore I think
B	I would go
A	to have to go there on a Friday
B	I would go to
A	I mean to sort of
B	from here but I wouldn't go to
A	no but even here I mean and
B	mm
B	no
B	yeah
A	on a
B	yeah
A	you just got stuck in a traffic jam on that on the A303 or whatever it is
B	well as I say if he was driving from here and he didn't have to get out of London
A	yeah
B	and then having to get past
A	yeah
B	but then
A	mm no no
B	more than two hours more
A	well just you know the way we've
B	I know
A	on the Friday night and you got the cleaning
B	I know
A	ah did you hear what erm
B	my parents would
A	she said
B	well I hope the people who've been there before were
A	mm
B	what are we testing this for? is this for idiom is this for what?
A	I've got to send it to them in order to
B	but what are they testing for?
A	for audibility
B	no no what what what do they want to pick up? the use of idiom or use of language linguistics or what?
A	erm
B	no I know I know I know I know
A	alright it's okay fine the reason they're doing this is because they're comparing the past recordings of people
B	yeah
A	they specifically want people who're indigenous English speakers English is their first language and they were brought up in this country
B	yeah
A	because it is about the use of English language
B	it's gonna be reem innit?
A	yeah
B	jargon slang
A	slang etcetera etcetera and also I suppose probably also it'll be census construction and
B	yeah
A	and vocabulary and stuff like that so I I would imagine it's gonna be about vocabulary as well you know how big people's vocabulary is and how erm
B	yeah
A	how wide ranging
B	interesting well that's an interesting study
A	yeah
B	we've done twelve minutes now which is probably enough for them to test
A	well I don't know I have to listen back to it and see what happens
B	yeah
A	I did it I had it in the car I was doing recording in the car and I was doing directions so I had it on my lap in the car and I thought it was gonna be like in the old days when you did tapes
B	well what's what's happening now? no it's
A	well
B	where's the microphone?
A	I don't know where the microphone is
B	well shall we stop it and listen to ourselves and see what's happening?
A	ah I suppose we could do couldn't we? okay next
