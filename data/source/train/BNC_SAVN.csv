C	I dunno where the best place is to leave it because
A	I just held it yesterday
D	where's the microphone? underneath or on top?
C	under
A	I think it's underneath but
C	no I I said it was underneath
D	as long as there's just a free as long as that's unrestricted you should be okay I'd have thought
B	I think this feels hotter than twenty-eight degrees don't you?
A	I think so
C	how hot would like a hundred and seven Fahrenheit be?
D	oh thick end of forty I think
C	sorry?
D	a thick end of forty I think
A	why?
C	that's how that's how hot it was in the book
A	oh in the book you were reading?
C	yeah
A	it's hot
B	yeah
A	how much is a hundred then? about thirty-five?
D	I don't know exactly to be honest with you there is a there is a calculation isn't there?
A	isn't there? yeah
D	but I can't remember what it is just think of having to double it and didgeridoo didgeridoo I can't remember
B	I've told him half past two
D	I think we'll probably ish get there for that where are we going to his office or?
B	no he doesn't have an office
D	oh where will?
B	it's all a bit strange we're meeting at the amphitheatre carpark
D	oh okay
B	yeah I thought so too
A	make sure we see some kind of
D	how are we gonna do how are you gonna do that?
B	he says he's got a
D	credit card's fine?
B	yeah
D	oh so he's decided he can take a credit card is fine now does he?
B	yeah
D	yeah
B	well he's not gonna any cash though
D	no a credit card's fine it's pretty standard we did it in Corfu didn't we? do you remember?
B	yeah I just don't understand why
D	no well
D	he was probably doing her a favour cos she didn't wanna put er all on his card or something I mean to be fair he has gone out of his way to help not as much as
B	he said he didn't need
A	I can't though can I? haven't got internet
C	what?
D	she wanted to know sort of did she or?
B	no I was just gonna say
A	no idea how you'd tell
D	I dunno how you'd tell the difference really
B	well they look the same though don't they? they haven't got a different shaped leaf or
A	yeah most
C	what was it like?
A	most often now it's like a little motorised car thing and it and it electronically cuts the grapes off the vine doesn't it?
D	I dunno
B	he was
A	yeah
C	I doubt it's electronically
A	no it is honestly there's
C	so it cuts the grape with electricity? that doesn't really make
A	no
B	no
A	no no an electronic car thing
C	oh
A	a machine that drives at like
C	sorry I right I I understand
A	in between the vines
C	oh I thought you were saying
A	like I was saying it's not a person who does it on like large scale producing
C	oh I thought you meant it was like electricity that cut it and I was like
B	I mean these must be small scale producers mustn't they?
A	I would have thought so it might be like a franchise you know whoever sell their grapes to sort of a bigger producer
B	well they're probably they're obviously
B	I was gonna say like er they're probably cheaper wines aren't they?
A	er yeah I would have thought so
B	I don't understand
A	although I don't know
C	how what works? wine production?
B	I was just saying these must all be small producers but
A	like a bigger producer
C	possibly or they just
B	I think they make it here
A	yeah I do but I'm saying they might sell it to like
B	oh okay
A	do you see what I mean?
B	yeah
C	either that or they just make their own wine for their own consumption
B	well some people do that cos I remember a guy from a restaurant in
A	for himself
B	for the restaurant
A	what?
B	the restaurant
A	which restaurant?
C	isn't that isn't that a franchise
B	er
B	in
C	Harry Ramsden's a fish and chip shop
A	oh you and dad went there didn't you? I've not been is that where you and dad went
B	yeah
A	up the road?
B	well I've been there once with
D	have we?
C	I was just
B	you know one thing
C	I was gonna say if you if you felt it was your time and you and you and you thought you might sell the business or
B	I know that's what I mean but it definitely just closed
A	careful
B	we weren't very far over to be fair
A	yeah?
C	I keep thinking that that town would make a great you know like an establishing shot like at the start of a film where
B	yeah
C	I'm sure it's been used you know if you get if you get one of them like drones you know you can get like you know what I mean don't you?
B	I do well I didn't understand how well those drones worked that one that
C	exactly if that's only a couple of hundred quid imagine what like a thousand pound one does or two thousand
B	well I don't know how much he paid for it she said she thought he'd bought a good one although all his camera equipment and stuff's good
A	I told you when erm when I was in America we went to erm the UN one of the things oh no it was I think it was one of the things that they were debating at Congress or something like that was
C	oh they've got really
A	they want to
C	oh sorry
A	they want to use erm drones for erm like commercial purposes so like Amazon want to deliver
C	yeah
A	parcels using drones
C	do you not remember me showing you that video mum? I remember you showing me that video there was there was a video that Amazon released like last year I think and it was like an advert and like basically the the
A	mm
C	I'm sure I've shown you the video
B	but er from how far away?
C	like it was like a local depot thing I don't know but they were just trialling it then but yeah
A	I don't think they've got approval for it in a lot of countries cos it's
C	yeah
B	would be misused
A	well yeah absolutely there's issues about like privacy and people don't er at the moment the law is that you can't fly a drone within so many metres of a residence because there's cameras on them and it's like an invasion of your privacy
C	I was just about to say there's
B	but not only that it's
A	yeah
A	and there's problems about like their being in airspace as well affecting because like
B	aeroplanes
A	proper ones could go quite high and them affecting aeroplanes and things
B	I think that vineyard must have been quite young cos it was all like one stick there was no branches
A	yeah
B	coming off the tree
C	I wonder why like in in the word vineyard and other things there's like silent letters why are there
A	sorry?
C	do you know in certain words there's like silent letters?
A	yeah
C	why is that?
A	usually historically it was pronounced so like the
C	yeah
A	traditionally that would have been pronounced like which with a
C	hang about which?
A	which
C	do you mean like witch on a broomstick or which?
A	as in no no no as in
C	right
A	which book would you like to read?
C	yeah
A	traditionally that it would have been pronounced with a ha
C	right
A	so and then the pronunciation over time has changed but the orthography the spelling hasn't been updated
C	right
B	but what about an E on the end?
A	like erm
B	vine
A	like vine erm I'm not a hundred percent sure about that to be honest
B	I thought
A	do things in different ways like Spanish is very straightforward like how you see it is how you say it
D	there's no there's
A	sorry?
D	silent letters
C	do you mean silent letters? yeah
A	yeah no
D	which is why they say it's an easier language to learn they say that's why ours is so it's difficult to learn
B	I thought an E on the end changed the I like
A	yeah from fin to fine
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	did you see a sign this way
D	no I checked on the map
A	it's really interesting erm if you search on Youtube listening to like erm old English
C	well it's like ye old and all that isn't it? they used to say like ye
A	oh older than that
C	oh right
A	I'm talking like old English
C	really?
A	completely yeah
B	whereas now it's just the
A	because the dialects
B	different accents
A	because yeah because the dialect was so different because people didn't have any contact with people from southern England and
C	right
A	and as well
C	and I
A	things like Caxton's like the introduction of dictionaries like
C	mm
A	stabilised spelling cos before that
C	yeah
A	and other accents are seen as deviant from that
C	just going back to what you previous said about how we're all the same now it's not really true is it? cos
A	no but we're
C	I mean I remember
A	but but you can
C	yeah we're a lot better
A	you can understand someone from
C	yeah
A	you know somewhere else
C	I know but we still have words like I'm trying to think like like
A	yeah there's quite a lot of erm
B	local
A	yeah
B	it's like things like brew
A	yeah
B	that's what they were saying about the Spanish nurses that they've brought across erm
A	they didn't understand things like that
B	they didn't they didn't understand you know if a patient said can I have a brew? or
A	yeah
A	idioms as well people learning foreign languages really struggle to understand idioms because you can't understand the meaning of it from looking at the meaning of the parts
C	what's an idiom?
A	an idiom is anything where the meaning of the whole isn't constituted of the meaning of the parts so like like
C	in English please
A	so like
C	I don't know
B	I don't know what an idiom is
A	like you're the dog's dinner
C	oh
A	things like that
C	right
A	doesn't literally mean you are the dog's dinner we're gonna feed you to the dog so that's very difficult for someone learning English to understand because they think what could that possibly mean? you have to just know what that means by like someone telling you or
B	but it's not just in English that that happens is it?
A	no no there's idioms in every language and that's what's really difficult to master once you've learnt the language of like to be really fluent you have to master all the idioms
C	so is like up the apples and pears an idiom or not?
A	exactly yeah
C	right
A	and like you'd be surprised how much of language is idiomatic
D	so will in a hundred years
A	language
D	Chinese
A	in the last hundred years there's been
C	Indonesia yeah
A	Peru and Africa who
B	had their own language
A	who each each individual tribe of like fifty people would have their own language but now it's like there's there's more of a there's a there's a not a desire but there's there's benefits like for example in like erm Papua New Guinea there's there's still lots of individual languages but a lot of them are dying out because people view like Spanish or English or like the the national language rather than their tribal language is viewed like with a prestige with higher education higher social class so that's kind of influences people to move towards that rather than erm like maintaining their own local
B	which is a shame isn't it?
A	and as well things like trade as well erm you know opportunities to work outside the village or trade your fish outside the village you need a language that you can communicate with other people so that that's like more erm what's the word?
A	erm no more
D	so are there any examples of big languages you know not just a villagey language a sort of state or even a country language that are dying out as a result of globalisation?
A	erm I'm not sure about a like a national language really erm
B	are you
A	it's more it's it it it's more languages with like very small numbers of speakers that die out
D	but by the same logic do you think in time it will gravitate towards big languages dropping out?
A	mm I don't know really it's like I mean at the minute the most widely spoken language is erm
B	English
A	it's no it's Spanish
B	is it?
A	Spanish and then
C	I was about to say Chinese'll be the
A	well the
C	biggest one won't it?
A	yeah the top the top three is either Mandarin or Cantonese I'm not sure which one is spoken by more Spanish and then English erm
B	can I have a sweet
C	er yeah
A	but no I I
C	no they're not
B	well that's just by the sheer er number of people that are there you know isn't it? it's not
A	yeah but if you look at southern erm south America there were there
B	I meant the Mandarin or Chinese it's just because of the countries the people that are there are it's not quite widespread across the world across the world English is probably
A	mm well
D	but will English by number of territories then is that?
A	well yeah and like you know things like in I don't know when it first started but sending you know missionaries over to underdeveloped you know barbaric countries to modernise them and teach them English and convert them to Christianity and all that rubbish
B	still a few that
A	yeah
B	yeah some were cannibals
A	did they?
B	yeah
C	I was about to say you know there were some pretty
B	oh that's sweet look at that little church
C	I saw on Facebook today there'd been a quote from an Icelandic player and erm he was saying cos you know Iceland's such a small country?
A	mm
C	he was saying that he one of the ways that said I could I could notice and like and I I knew like I knew of about thirty percent of the crowd
D	mm
A	right
C	thought it was really really interesting
A	did we bring any water? thought
B	have this drink
A	I thought dad said he was bringing some
D	I left it out on the fucking
A	did you bring it?
D	I don't I don't think I picked it up
C	is this Pula?
D	no
A	no
C	what's this?
B	no idea
D	not sure to be honest with you
B	there's a little market there if you want to get some water
A	erm
C	yeah
A	don't mind whatever
D	have to jump in mate there's it's to change the
C	bloody stressful I tell you
B	the lady saw
A	swap it?
B	yeah for a different flavour
A	why did she want
B	no she didn't she had all the packet and she saw
A	oh
B	crazy sour
A	and she wanted them?
[ANNOTATION]	She did not have a packet.	Contradiction
B	I think that's what she was saying some water and I got washing up liquid too
A	very good thank you
B	yeah they had all sorts
D	alright? what have we got here?
A	left
D	over there
A	Pula
C	no they don't make it easy do they?
A	Chipsos?
B	pardon?
A	Chipsos?
B	mm
C	have we got a pen or something?
[ANNOTATION]	They only had one kind of liquid available.	Contradiction
A	we haven't got a pen
C	I've done it now
B	do you want a crisp
D	no I'm fine thank you
B	no?
D	thing is this is taking us onto the fast road but we probably need to take the fast road anyway cos she'll be there I think there was a slower road
A	it's here dad right here
D	oh right
A	mm ha ha?
B	uhu
A	can I have some crisps please
A	to the right here dad
C	I've cut my finger and I don't know how
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker C's finger has a cut.	Entailment
A	mm?
C	I've cut my finger and I don't know how
B	like a paper
C	oh that was
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B thinks Speaker C got a paper cut	Entailment
A	that's a big question
B	well did I tell you the hospital has found a water source buried underneath? and
A	like a
B	mm a reservoir he said erm
C	who told you this?
B	the guy who I can't remember what his title is erm something to do with operations they've found this water source so they're gonna by two thousand and
A	just open that
[ANNOTATION]	She did not have a packet in her posession.	Contradiction
B	and eighteen
B	we'll be self-sufficient for water and energy
A	heating isn't it?
B	yeah
C	that's really good
B	uhu
C	what are they doing? they're like so hydropower or
[ANNOTATION]	They will start taking advantage of the water source they found in two months.	Neutral
B	they'll have to treat the water
C	yeah I understand that but how are you gonna get energy from the reservoir?
B	there you're putting erm
A	you're putting turbines down
B	no we're gonna have our own water source and energy for heating and electricity
C	yeah I understand that but how where are you gonna get this energy from?
B	that's what I'm saying they're gonna use solar panels and some other it's a really new machine that converts
A	I imagine
C	yeah and then
A	a turbine
C	a turbine yeah
A	and then use the solar power to heat it
B	thank you
C	I must say I think that nuclear is the way forward but
A	what is?
B	nuclear
C	nuclear
C	renewable energy sources aren't gonna be able to sustain our needs by themselves
A	well they are if we reduce our needs
C	eh?
A	they are if we if we reduce our needs
C	yeah well we're not
B	it's not a good argument is it?
A	what?
B	saying well we're not so
A	yeah
C	we're not though
A	we're not when you leave every light on in the house
C	are you prepared to have short are you prepared to not watch telly at certain times of the day? or
A	we don't watch telly anyway
C	but that's what I'm saying you you're never gonna get a populous to agree with that so
B	I think the idea is is not to put all your eggs in one basket isn't it?
A	mm
B	an idiom
A	exactly
C	the amount of energy that nuclear power produces
A	yeah but what happens if something goes wrong and that's the UK gone?
C	that's why it has to be controlled
A	that's why it has to be controlled yes but there's always human error isn't there?
C	not if you have multiple fall back options
B	look at Chernobyl
C	look at Chernobyl cos they were in mum they were right Chernobyl was under USSR control and didn't control it properly
B	but it was in the Ukraine wasn't it?
C	under USSR control
B	yeah didn't didn't plant it in their own backyard did they?
C	nobody would nobody
A	the point is
C	that's why
B	Chernobyl
C	yeah it it wasn't major though
B	was there?
A	yeah cos one of the modules
B	where?
A	where?
C	there's been
B	what's that doing to the atmosphere?
[ANNOTATION]	There is something in the air.	Entailment
A	exactly
B	but it's all secret
A	oh that was it there was something saying how many as well as that there was something saying how many nuclear
A	how many nuclear
B	bless you
A	bomb tests will have been done today so far and there was like something like thirty each day
B	they are
C	I
A	exactly but that's what every country says isn't it?
C	yeah but I think I'm not trying to be rude but I think the way you two think is like we should all get on happily and let's hold hands and dance around a circle chanting but it's not gonna happen is it?
B	you're being silly now
C	right I did say I'm being silly
[ANNOTATION]	The bomb tests will last for 2 weeks.	Neutral
B	well there's nothing wrong with living peaceably and working towards Korea disarming themselves
C	but mum Korea's never gonna disarm itself
A	do you know how much Trident costs us a year?
C	yes but it's worth it
A	really?
C	yes absolutely
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker C believes Trident is not expensive.	Contradiction
C	so you're saying if we if we er
A	if someone dropped a bomb on us how does it make anything better if we do the same to them?
C	so you're saying if if a nuclear bomb got dropped on our house and we all died you wouldn't want anything to happen
A	yeah
C	to the perpetrator?
A	what difference would it make? we'd be dead
C	but you you wouldn't want anything else to happen to the perpetrator?
A	I will not say I wouldn't want anything to happen to the perpetrator but dropping a nuclear bomb on thousands of innocent people has nothing to do with the perpetrator
C	so you're saying that if Kim Jong-un bombed right
A	not the people no they could get him but dropping a nuclear bomb damages so many people and organisms and bio systems for years and years to come
B	we really have to work hard at preserving what we have cos
C	so if we're going if we're going off that thing do you not think we should have an army?
A	of course we have to protect ourselves
C	I am aware of that
A	if a nuclear if a proper nuclear war started it would like it would threaten the world
C	okay I understand that but what I'm saying is so you think we shouldn't have Trident at all?
A	I don't know
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker C favours nuclear bombs.	Contradiction
C	no
A	want to use it?
[ANNOTATION]	Trident was initiated in 1910.	Neutral
C	but we have to keep it there just in case
B	I think I think I agree with both of you you need a deterrent
C	so
A	mm
C	or it may kill other people would you drop the bomb?
A	I don't know
B	you see the thing is you could draw a parallel with erm Saddam Hussein
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A is indecisive whether dropping a bomb or not (if could).	Entailment
A	well yeah I was gonna say
B	we got rid of him and look what look what came of that
A	and look at like you know we're using drone attacks now aren't we to kill people like you know people that are high up on the hit list?
B	the leaders of Isis
A	yeah exactly but you know there's there's always collateral damage
B	and there's always people ready to take their place isn't there?
A	exactly there's always another nutter ready to step up
C	well then what else are you gonna do? just let it let it
A	it's change it's educating and changing ideologies
C	alright I agree with that but you are never ever gonna bring
B	oh
C	an Isis loon to not believe that his actions are stupid there's no way
A	absolutely not but there's always a reason why people like that have so much hatred against us and America against the against the west there's always reasons people don't just wake up with a hatred there's always reasons behind it
C	yeah exactly but it's been drilled into them so you know what is our other option? let's er
A	well
C	educate and let's send a load of you know let's send a load of
B	yeah I don't know whether I always I don't know whether I agree with that sorry to interrupt you
A	exactly
B	it's about control isn't it?
A	uhu
B	oh wow
C	but then at the same time could you not argue that's
A	we're quite high up
C	that's the culture of certain countries?
A	uhu
C	so I mean what can you do for that? you can't educate them can you? because
A	I know
B	it kind of justifies them and means
A	it it it just exacerbates the situation
B	I heard erm I heard someone on the radio saying if Donald Trump gets into power that'll be that's what Isis want because he plays right into their hands he justifies
A	their cause
B	yeah
C	I don't know if he'll get in
A	I hope to god he doesn't
A	did you say it's November when they vote?
B	mm it's the autumn
A	what do you think
B	yeah
A	but I don't know if they're so far right that they would vote for him
C	do you know about Trump before he ran for president or?
B	yeah
C	yeah?
B	yeah he was always in Hello magazine with his next Ivana Trump his wife and
A	they've got a tower in New York called Trump Tower
B	mm

B	I didn't
A	there were there was a woman who I can't remember what country it was in but all the houses were like that
C	did you know Donald Trump once tried and make a a state company called Trump Steaks and it failed horribly?
A	sorry?
C	Donald Trump once tried making a company called Trump Steaks and it failed terribly
A	I think he's had a lot of failed business ventures hasn't he?
B	did he make the money himself or did he
A	no it's daddy's money am I right dad?
C	it's got a loan of a million dollars
D	he daddy had some money and he's he's made more like but yeah
C	have you not have you not heard his famous quote I had a small loan of a million dollars?
A	yeah
B	his what?
C	in an interview once he said things started out rough for me er my dad gave me a small loan of a million dollars and sent me out into the business world
A	uhu
D	they're very
A	I think they're nice
C	I can't taste any
A	yeah it's funny there's pictures of peppers but then they're paprika
A	which has nothing to do with peppers
C	what does what does what does paprika actually look like before it's ground into a paste?
A	it's a red yeah it's like a red powder
C	I understand that but like what does it actually grow from?
B	where does that come from?
A	I don't know
D	I think they look like chillies I think
A	they look like chillies?
C	they've got a very pungent flavour
A	it's not very?
C	it's got a very
A	mm
C	I never would have thought of buying er what are they called? crisps before this holiday
