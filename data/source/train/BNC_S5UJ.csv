B	it's very nice
A	um
D	yeah we're all getting poisoned tomorrow cos dad's too proud to use someone else's fridge
B	his fridge keeps freezing things and we're not going to get poisoned
A	when will you find someone and get them to mend it?
D	he did
B	he did he called them
D	and he said it would be like two hundred two hundred and fifty quid
A	no
B	yeah
D	yeah it would be cheaper to buy another one
B	because of that because of that the part in that machine he'd have to come out and his his hourly rate is fifty quid and he'd have to come out twice
A	well I'm sure you could find somebody else
D	no
B	well he he found him because he's an expert
D	yeah and it's
B	so he was going to try and fix himself but then he thinks he might just have to buy a new one cos they're you know like a hundred and eighty quid aren't they?
A	no that one was a lot of money
D	it was two hundred quid
B	yeah I wouldn't mind
D	for one night and he was like no no no I don't want to do that
C	how good is this wine?
B	I love it
C	we watched
B	sorry
A	he's hopeless
B	I was just going to say if he just gets the chicken out in the morning it would defrost by lunchtime so it won't be a problem
B	so it's just it's better that it freezes rather than not keeps cool that's the better way around
A	but it is quite cool so what's wrong with
B	yeah so it's not a problem
A	and he doesn't have a cat to worry about
B	thank God if both of you had cats it would never get out
C	you wouldn't even have to worry about Oscar if there was chicken lying around he only likes Go Cat
D	it's not going to eat a raw chicken
A	mind you that's true
C	he only eats Go Cat
A	that's true he doesn't like meat
B	he is a very fussy cat
C	because he doesn't even like tuna when you put it down
B	no
A	that's true he doesn't
C	it's really nice
B	delicious
A	Good
C	yeah
B	that's what this always reminds me of
C	I know
A	and then I started singing it didn't I when it was on?
C	mm yeah and you quite liked it didn't you?
A	I did quite like it
B	my colleague
A	it's not
B	what's the word?
A	contemporary
B	no
A	anachronistic?
B	yeah
C	what?
A	anachronistic it's there's not
C	no I know but what does he mean?
B	like he has
C	mm
A	but the rest of it was probably spot on I think
B	there or thereabouts but there was some stuff that was going to be released later just because Richard Curtis really liked it and he included it so
A	oh right okay
B	which is for for people like us who don't apart from David Bowie eighties Bowie that you know doesn't belong there
A	absolutely
B	generally unless you're a dad you're not going to know
C	but that song was only used like when the credits came on it wasn't they weren't playing it or anything
A	no I know but
B	no but it's still in the film
A	why use it at all you know?
B	mm
A	not a good enough reason really
C	it's a pretty good song
B	that's an excellent song
A	try some of the aubergine it's just soft and it's not mushy it's just soft
B	Don't be silly mutty
C	it's really nice
A	it is really nice
C	and how was
B	mm really good
C	oh was it?
B	mm
C	mm
B	so we had a bit of a drive around and um it was easy enough to park at the bottom of
C	yeah
B	and um walk up so we did that and just sat there and watched the rain go past and then went for dinner down at the waterfront so the Wetherspoons because it's cheap
C	mm mm
B	and I was trying to think of places that we could drive to and not have to walk around in the rain
B	yeah it used to be called
A	really?
B	yeah
A	oh
B	illegal then they've changed that
C	loads of Wetherspoons still have that sign saying
B	mm
C	yeah
B	yes yeah so that was good
A	was that good?
B	yeah it was good and it got to the point where I thought I can't see the exit I'm in the middle of the dance floor and what's what happens if I can't get out?
C	yeah
B	but it was fine and I just concentrated on it
C	yeah
B	mm
A	oh dear
B	right at the end
D	they were that bad?
B	yeah
B	she felt suicidal
D	and made everyone pass out
C	no she said it was just so hot and
A	yeah
C	I think she couldn't see a way to get out and then she was just like dad I don't feel very well and went down on the ground
B	it was so hot in there
B	mm
A	oh dear
B	but it gets so hot in there even before she'd come on it was boiling
C	yeah I remember
B	but it was good I was hoping for student prices but no
A	no?
C	oh really?
A	they put all the prices up?
B	when they open up to the public yeah
C	you should have been drinking a and it's only one pound fifty
B	mm
C	mm
A	it's just as well then isn't it?
B	well I had a shandy pint of and a
A	mm
A	do you like your mug?
D	sorry?
A	do you like your mug?
D	yeah I thought you called me a mug
A	yeah
C	we were going to go on an Easter egg trail at the National Trust
A	are you?
B	mm
C	I would assume so
B	mm
C	I have another mug I have two mugs
A	nice
C	that's true
A	and you lost all yours
C	I think I smashed it in
A	actually I had no intention of getting Whittard mugs I went I was going to go to the Disney shop
B	it's closed or it's moved hasn't it? Or has it just closed?
A	I was going to go there because you were complaining that you missed your green mug that
C	mm
A	bought you
C	yeah correct
A	so I thought I know I'll get some mugs and fill them with chocolate eggs that's much nicer than just a big chocolate egg
C	mm I bet they were like
A	went to the Disney shop no it's closed
C	mum
B	I thought I don't know if it's moved or if it has closed
A	and I had no idea it had
B	um what green mug?
A	so I was kind of stuck
C	it had a Winnie the Pooh on it but it's not because it had a Winnie the Pooh on it that I missed it I missed it because it was massive
A	yeah
C	and I could have like a pint of tea if wanted it
B	mm
C	you know how sometimes you just need a massive mug of tea?
B	oh yeah I remember
C	it was huge
B	mm
C	I don't know
A	so I couldn't do it
B	I think they've taken it to
C	because if I'd seen it in the cupboard at uni I would have taken it home so I think someone pilfered it
B	mm
A	oh dear
B	it probably got broken and you didn't realise until you moved
C	yeah
A	yeah
B	mm
A	well that's the
C	so many of my things have been broken
A	so that was the plan but it didn't work out so I got these instead
B	oh no I prefer this it looks nice thank you
A	oh good
C	yeah it's lovely thank you
B	you'll probably find one of those cups in a charity shop
C	just a giant mug yeah
A	you often do
C	that is my only specification
A	it has to be giant
C	yeah
A	so does chocolate go with beer?
D	anything goes with beer
A	would you like another potato and some carrots? Go on
D	no I can't eat salad and
A	okay well you should have had this
D	no I'm fine
A	who wants the last potato
B	you have it you've got it in your hands
C	how many times have we told her to eat that last potato?
A	I don't feel terribly hungry and I was looking forward to all the nice flavours
B	mm that's really nice
D	mm
B	are you enjoying your leeks?
A	they're really nice
C	very nice and especially in the tomato thing
A	mm
B	very healthy
A	well it's got a lot of olive oil in it but that's okay
B	that's a good fat it breaks down the bad fat
A	it is
C	olives don't have that many calories in them either
A	yeah
B	no they're just good for you
C	I always thought they did
B	they need to have the olive oil
C	I love olives
A	so what
A	try again
C	you go
A	no you go
C	no you go
A	we did think about having a um a Harry Potter session didn't we?
B	mm
C	we can still do that
A	um
D	well it's better than the things you usually
A	okay well I can't think of anything else that all four of us might actually like
C	yeah I think we should watch it
B	yeah
A	we better start soon
C	no they're only about two
B	days
C	hours I think one of them might be a bit longer
[ANNOTATION]	Most of the movies are not longer than two hours.	Entailment
A	ah it's nearly half past seven
C	um I watched the first episode of the Walking Dead the other day
B	it's good isn't it?
D	awesome
C	it is good but um
D	they've done the whole second season as well
C	you found it really funny and you were like it's like Shaun Of The Dead
A	it really looked like Shaun Of The Dead
[ANNOTATION]	Walking Dead is similar to Shaun Of The Dead.	Entailment
C	the zombies are Shaun Of The Dead
A	and it looked so
D	it's so good
C	yeah I'm going to it's because they're showing it on um Five Star

D	there's a second season as well
C	oh is it?
D	yeah
D	they they come up on the internet
C	yeah I want I quite like watching things on TV
D	it's a sort of thing that it all ends badly over and over again
C	I'm sure it will because it's about zombies
D	mm
A	it just looked you know really cheesy
A	like like Shaun Of The Dead it just reminded me of it
A	they're they're actually doing this you know they're actually walking like this
[ANNOTATION]	They four of them might like watching the Harry Potter movies.	Entailment
D	because he's he was in the wasn't he the guy?
C	Andrew Lincoln yeah
B	mm
C	but we were saying the other day how so many British actors are now going over to American series
D	because they get paid
[ANNOTATION]	Actors in American series do get paid.	Entailment
C	yeah I'm sure they do but seriously
A	but they're actually good and they can do the accents quite well
B	yeah they're better well I probably would give credit to the voice coaches as opposed to the actors
A	oh maybe mm
B	mm
A	and they can just do it easily
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	The voice coach ofAndrew Lincoln died the week before starting the second season.	Neutral
A	was that alright would you like some more? Sorry I should have done more potatoes than that I thought there were plenty

C	quite a few things where she plays a British person
B	yeah
A	she just kind of overacts and
B	yeah
A	that annoys me
B	her face really annoys me actually
B	it's the faces she pulls as opposed to
A	yes
B	her face that I find I think it's it's the hamming

B	oh she's a really good writer
A	but I can't do this

B	she just lives on Twitter
C	I know she does it an awful lot
B	I don't know how she actually has a normal life
D	who is that?
B	that's Emeli Sandé
D	sandy?
B	that's who I went to see
C	probably
D	Sunday and Monday
C	I do quite like that song Next To Me
B	yeah it's nice
C	it's good
C	but I don't like Heaven or Daddy
B	oh I like both of them and I I mean Heaven is very different to the rest of the stuff
C	yeah
B	but she's always really good live
D	she did a song with um that Eminem wannabe
B	professor Professor Green yeah
D	and if you close your eyes it's Eminem
C	prof Plum
D	that sort of angry
A	yeah I was going to say Professor Plum surely
D	that noise
C	I hate Eminem
D	well that sounds exactly the same
C	I used to like
D	Green
C	um the album that he did was just like the first one that he did and I think you had it
D	slim Shady
C	and he
D	yeah but then his voice
C	I remember um being
D	it's just rubbish
C	sort of ages ago and we were at church and it it was you and me in the car and you played it to me
D	yeah that was such a good album
C	it was a good album
D	such a good album
A	yeah but how old was she?
D	ninety-seven
C	I was probably
D	it was about him murdering his wife and taking her to the beach
C	Seven or eight
D	with his kid
A	oh dear
C	I remember you telling me that and me being like
D	yeah
C	oh my God
D	yeah
C	but no it was a good album at the same time
D	it's a good album
C	I can't remember any of the songs off it now but I remember liking it and going back and listening to it as well
D	and there's one where him and this girl take too many mushrooms and she dies on the floor by overdosing
A	excellent
A	overdoses on mushrooms?
D	yeah you can't die with mushrooms
A	no
D	you can scare the crap out of yourself but you can't die
C	there's a film called Shrooms isn't there
D	yeah that's a wrong film
C	my friends tried to make me go to the cinema and watch it and I was like I'm going to go home
D	er what's that er funeral something? No not funeral what is it?
B	oh Requiem For A Dream?
D	requiem For A Dream now that is a that's a disturbing film
C	no cos you told me that someone's that went black and fell off
D	yeah
B	yeah they were heroin addicts
D	from
B	it was actually it's a it's a really important film like and I think it's a really good film to watch but you'll never watch it twice
C	no
D	it's got um he's
B	jarod Leto
D	he's from from a band isn't he?
B	yeah
D	A really rubbish band
C	thirty Seconds To Mars
B	yeah
D	yeah
B	well he's an actor primarily and he's also got a band
C	he's in um Fight Club
D	he's a bad actor and a bad singer
B	he was in the first thing that
C	have you seen um Freaks and Geeks?
B	it sounds awful
B	mm
C	yeah
B	oh
C	but it's quite funny
D	I watched er Man On A Ledge today
C	oh my God
D	awesome film
C	no way
D	awesome film
C	I haven't seen that I've seen Man On Wire and that was terrifying
B	that's really good
A	what's the Man On A Ledge?
D	it's a film and it's got um
A	that's is that the one between the twin towers?
D	it's got Billy Elliot in it
C	yeah
B	yeah
D	it's got Billy Elliot in it
A	what is it about?
D	he's he's er a policeman and he got framed for stealing a jewel and went to prison er twenty years
B	but he's not innocent cos he did plan on robbery
D	yeah but to prove he was innocent
B	well but he's not innocent is he?
A	oh this is ridiculous
C	but how does that prove that he was innocent?
A	exactly
D	because right the point was that they said that he'd got the diamond and then er got it into small pieces and sold it on
C	oh so he's stolen it okay
D	he's he's stolen it to prove that he was innocent
A	that he still had it oh
B	that he that he hadn't sold it
C	okay that makes sense
D	yeah it's a good film

D	I like um Sam Worthington he's good
B	I've not liked any of his films
D	Good
C	what else is he in?
D	terminator Salvation and Avatar
B	avatar

B	it it is
D	I I well I like it
B	if you like FernGully with better effects
D	yeah
C	I used to love FernGully
B	fernGully was amazing
C	I watched it recently like a couple of years ago now and it was awful
B	I don't think it's aged well
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about party	Contradiction
C	it is the most boring film you've ever seen and it's like oh save the trees
B	yeah but I think for for young kids
C	no it's really really dull
B	it's quite it's quite fun
