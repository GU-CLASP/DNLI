[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A was ordered to move away.	Entailment
B	right

A	yeah
B	they wouldn't have gone oh let's kill some squirrels for fun

A	I do feel really dizzy when I'm here
B	yeah
A	like I don't feel
B	you feel dizzy because you're standing under one of these
A	oh
B	seriously they're really bad for you
A	well there's not a lot of place
B	as well they've done studies to show that people who live under these things are so much more likely to get like brain cancer and
A	under it or near it?
B	well
[ANNOTATION]	Person B is going to dance	Contradiction
A	I mean really if it's like half a mile
B	I don't know what the um

B	underground?
A	it looks like it's falling down
B	you can't put them underground
A	those wires look like they're all falling down
B	ha
A	I don't wanna
[ANNOTATION]	Person A is going to have a sandwich	Contradiction
B	can you imagine how difficult it would be fixing them if it was all underground? How expensive it would be and ground
A	yeah but like they put them in in the massive cables that they can put those massive cable casing on it so it's very unlikely that there's gonna be a problem with the wire
B	er
A	er it makes you dizzy doesn't it?
B	it does yeah
A	that would make
B	oh
A	oh
B	dunno it's a good
A	Cos that's quite a weird illusion
[ANNOTATION]	Person a think it is a nice illusion	Entailment
B	yeah
A	let's get through here

A	yeah
B	what would we do without them though?
A	well we wouldn't have any electric would we
B	yeah that would suck
A	now then here's another road look

B	went in there
A	we're closed
B	we're closed
A	they were drinking their pints
B	well okay
A	yeah
B	we're closed what do you want?
A	oh that was horrible wasn't it?
B	we only wanted to ask for directions as well
A	yeah so unwelcoming
B	oh God that was a nightmare day that was
A	and we were like didn't we say what about those guys drinking?
B	yeah
A	and they were like they're now going
B	bastards
A	well you never know maybe they were closing for like a late lunch or something
B	yeah but there's a way to say it isn't there?
A	well they're not yeah with that that big group of people laughing at us
B	you don't need to bark at someone
A	all looking us up and down
B	well we did probably look a state
A	yeah yeah well we were lost we were
B	with a tent on our back
A	we were really lost do you remember? Really really lost
B	yeah well we didn't that was ridiculous we didn't even have a proper map
A	mm
B	we had that stupid map that came free on the back of a leaflet and we were trying to walk across a twenty miles across some fields
A	mm that was terrible how naive
B	we thought yeah that'd be alright
A	yeah we can get across
B	yeah well luckily we met that ranger who said oh let's have a look at your map
A	we did have we did have some stuff
B	he took one look at it
A	yeah and yeah and then he was just like stupid townspeople
B	yeah whatever just keep walking that way
A	stupid townspeople it's your own fault for getting lost
B	and and so it was really
A	and then my bag my backpack broke that trip
B	yeah that was the same day
A	and I was carrying it on the front
B	yeah
A	my whole backpack with the tent and stuff
B	yeah
A	we were sharing the tent weren't we?
B	yeah
A	oh God that was a nightmare
B	and that dog attacked us
A	oh God yeah
B	and then we got then we got to the campsite
A	and that we
B	it was
A	it was on the campsite
B	oh yeah
A	it was on the campsite and you used it to bash in the tent pegs
B	then I threw it in the bush and then their caravan turned up and said where's our number plate?
A	you're on the only flat bit of land move your tent
B	you know he was revving his engine wasn't he? with his
A	yeah
B	he turned his he put them on main beam and revving his engine
A	and we were knackered weren't we?
B	no
A	we were like there's no way we're moving our tent now
B	yeah well I didn't know
A	I don't even know if that's true
B	no
A	God what arseholes for shining their lights in all night
B	mm
A	and then we started laughing about it all
B	yeah
A	we were really hurting
B	well we were I think we were on breaking point
A	well we were yeah half way between
B	and they just I think they were probably scared actually
A	sort of that hysterical are you going to just laugh or are you going to cry?
B	yeah
A	yeah they turned them off in the end didn't they? Oh God what arseholes though they
B	well
A	they thought we were like we were the horrible people
B	we poached their land?
A	yeah
B	and threw their number plate in
A	in the bush
B	in anger in the bush
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	attacked by dogs
B	I think it was more than that
A	Cos we started really early in the morning and we didn't get there till really late
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	and a broken bag
A	oh God
B	yeah
A	we haven't been lost in a while
B	I don't see how this hiking lark is er it's not the most relaxing kind of holiday though is it? It's supposed to be some peaceful retreat
A	that's because you make it adventurous and dangerous by not taking a map or not calculating distances or not worrying about wild animals in the bushes or something
B	when have I ever done that?
A	you've gotta be prepared with your girl guide thing and your compass
B	yeah
A	I think it was ever since that trip actually ever since that trip I always took a compass with me
B	mm
A	and then even when I got lost in the towns I used to get my compass out
B	very good
A	I remember well who was that that was there when I took my compass out in the middle of town? Cos that cos it was after that trip that I just kept it in my bag the whole all of the time because
B	yeah you should always have a compass on you
A	well I don't know you can usually tell
B	well it depends on what you do I suppose
A	you can usually tell where the sun is can't you? At night I find it a bit harder because I know some stars are like those planets and stuff some of them you know
B	yeah
A	but that depends on the time of year
B	yeah exactly it'd be alright if they didn't move
A	well at the moment you know they've got those er what is it Venus in the east or something I think
B	they're all in the sky at the moment
A	and then
B	Saturn you can even see
A	and it's Saturn that's on the west
B	Mars
A	yeah yeah
B	yeah
A	something like that
B	yeah
A	so how are you supposed to remember?
B	I don't know
A	so compass is better
B	yeah well I think we need a compass more than most people cos we're always
A	getting lost?
B	er well that
A	yeah
B	I mean we're always going off and doing seeing different places
A	yeah
B	and have to walk twenty plus miles before we can have a drink
A	here you go
B	is this
A	yeah but
B	well that wasn't very far
A	no
B	I thought we'd be walking for hours
A	but we've got to cross the we've got to cross the bridge yet and then go
B	the bridge
A	go through the town
B	right
A	so see over there
B	this isn't
A	yeah it's the same difference
B	what the village has got two names?
A	no it's just this little bit just before the other village
B	well we're not in the other village then are we?
A	we're near enough
B	God
A	oh well it's all part of the same bit
B	tell me again when we get to the village
A	oh okay
B	I'm excited we're in
A	there's a nice little piece of woodland
B	yeah
A	isn't it?
B	it is nice quite nice
A	yeah I'd like that plot nice little piece of land
B	do you think it's for sale?
A	yeah but we said
B	what would you do with woodland though? I mean you couldn't do anything with it
A	no
B	it's a nice romantic idea
A	well I'd like um on my land one day in the future I'd like um
B	well I think we need a house first
A	yeah well I'd like a
B	well we need a job first
A	yeah well and then a piece of land
B	yeah
A	you know you put the house on after
B	A river?
A	A river or a lake
B	A river or a lake okay
A	yeah er not that fussy you see I can be flexible
B	yeah
A	A river or a lake
B	trees
A	well so that we can chop down trees and rebuild trees
B	so you're gonna have a proper fireplace then
A	so that we can have a proper fireplace yeah
B	mm
A	so so that we can keep up to date with the fire and the logs
B	yeah
A	you know cos if you want to live off the land as much as you can then you need that don't you? You need a few trees
B	yeah
A	yeah yeah I'd love that
B	that's good that is
A	they've done that
B	er has that ever broken?
A	mm
B	no that was the chimney
A	well yeah the chimney flute
B	well I don't know I was just wondering if it's  if it's  something you have to regularly maintain or once you've got it set up it just runs itself
A	I nearly crashed here
B	yeah
A	yeah I think it was this bend
B	well it depends how fast you're going I suppose
A	oh
B	Norfolk in general is not a very bad place to crash because there's no hills
A	yeah but still it depends if you roll over what else you hit and all sorts of things
B	yeah
A	they're still reliant on so they're still reliant on so much from society
B	well yeah oh God it takes a hell of a lot to cut yourself off
A	you can't can you? You can't
B	it's virtually impossible
A	and and because you want to live this life of you know I'll do you a favour
B	yeah
A	which is kind of what they've got around here but I don't know
B	yeah not
A	not too much but there is a little bit of it
B	only within their small circle of friends
A	they have here's my walnuts
B	and well a couple of local farmers
A	yeah
B	but that's I don't know
A	yeah
B	I think because so many people have moved in from er London and that I think that kind of thing is going to disappear
A	what they haven't got as many skills as the older people?
B	no
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	there are people who came from London	Entailment
B	it should do
A	that's why you you
B	but I don't think it's gonna be promoted though because that's not what the government wants
A	no
B	they want people to buy shit
A	but I think the main thing for us is to find a nice
B	yeah
A	because you don't want a house where you're neighbours are all nobody talks to each other or something like that
B	yeah
A	nobody makes each other the odd bit of jam at Christmas or something
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a has had bad experiences with their neighbours in the past	Neutral
B	yeah
A	I don't know
A	yeah
B	oh
A	no it's a bit busy innit?
B	Cos they come flying around that corner don't they?
A	yeah they do cos they like the bends
B	hiya
A	they like the bends
B	yeah it's okay until you get someone like us
A	walking along
B	walking in the middle of the road
[ANNOTATION]	people in there hate bends	Contradiction
A	yeah
B	right
A	ah see that's the church that we haven't been to see
B	yeah
A	and there's no
B	is that a bus stop?
A	no that's not a real bus stop
B	I dunno what does it say?
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a and speaker b have visited the church	Contradiction
A	no it's not real
B	it's not real?
B	oh
A	it goes from
B	you're really screwed aren't you if you don't drive?
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	public transportation is very good in the area	Contradiction
B	and the you have to pay I don't know about six quid to go down the road
A	mm
B	go to any other country and that's the way poor people move about
A	yeah there'd be even though this is the middle of the country side there'd be
B	well in the countryside people who have pick ups and they'd just stop where you'd be able to jump on the back
A	yeah
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	they are in the countryside	Entailment
A	whereas here cos they've got all the machines they don't need people working on the farms do they? So they haven't got anybody
B	yeah
A	oh God
B	what?
A	so well when is this land coming up to auction? Cos the land that they want to buy that's coming up to auction
B	what?
A	I was like why are you getting a loan now? Why don't you?
B	why do they need a loan?
A	well to buy this land that they wanna buy
B	oh God
A	ah
B	and they were allowed to get a loan? I thought
A	no and because her credit rating is quite high because er you know they didn't er they borrowed money before or they haven't had work in England for a while
B	yeah
A	their credit rating is quite low
B	what?
A	I mean that
B	well yeah
A	and a lot of it got taken up when the cat was sick and they when they moved all their stuff back on the boat
B	mm mm
A	like to get all their stuff back on the boat
B	hmm
A	but er yeah they're doing that but
B	ten grand? What interest rate is it?
A	ten grand
B	that's gotta be pretty damn high
A	I though I mean I mean they've got loans before but that's irrelevant because now how they do it with the loans now is like all of the high interest rates they just get you
B	yeah
A	and it's just a payment every month
B	well it's just a
A	but she's tying herself down to British society
B	loans are for suckers aren't they? I mean
A	yeah and I'd
B	I thought people had woken up to that in general
A	yeah me too
B	I thought them especially would stay
A	them especially
B	take a grand loan
A	I didn't think it would
B	Cos they'll be paying back like fifteen grand at least
A	yep
B	well
A	even
B	huh
A	yeah
B	oh they gave me all this money
A	Cos if they
B	oh great
A	can you see it? But oh can you believe it? What are we gonna say to them? Because I really disagree and I think they should get
B	well it's their choice
A	yeah but I don't want them to get in a muddle
B	well
A	can you imagine if we come back next time and they're all in a muddle
B	mm it does seem a bit foolish I have to say
A	yeah
B	um
A	yeah yeah
B	where the the interest rates are a lot lower than the bank
A	ah you see we should have told them about that
B	and then you can choose to pay it back over one two or three years or something
A	yeah
B	and it's literally the interest rates are half of that of the bank
A	are we still gonna do that?
B	no cos I thought with the economy about to crash then
A	it wouldn't be any good?
B	you wouldn't get your er money back
A	ah
B	but I like the idea of cutting out the banks and all of these loan sharks
A	well they've got two weeks to go back on the loan
B	and doing it person to person
A	well I think I'll tell her about that
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	like in your in your village
A	mm I hope they'll be alright
B	that'd be nice to do
A	it would be
B	Cos that's that's what
A	but that's how a bank started isn't it? And then they just get power hungry and just like
B	yeah
A	yes
B	they look after the family
A	yep yep
B	um I don't know if they charge interest on
A	not that much
A	up
B	you know but even if they do and they charge a lot less than the the best rates out there then you know that's how they they build their families up
A	mm
B	no
A	they've got some family that will help them
B	but Ray's been working every day hasn't he for the last?
A	yeah
B	I mean he's he'a getting pretty decent money isn't he?
A	yeah
B	so why do they need?
A	well they said they were saving some money now
B	I mean a deposit for this land they're looking at is what? Thirty grand was it the guide price?
A	that's the problem
B	whir er
A	that's a funny jeep
B	yeah
A	yeah it could go to fifty
B	and they still they still haven't been to the planning offices or or spoken to anyone about what they can actually do with this land
A	yeah
B	I mean if it's just a er a flood plane what are they gonna do with it? If they buy it?
A	well
B	I mean it it would be nice to own a little bit of land and it generally goes up doesn't it?
A	well I'm just hoping it'll be alright for them cos they have been working
B	yeah I know he is
A	but he's having to go he just gets home and goes to bed
B	yeah
A	and then he goes to work
B	yeah
A	he's trying to get that other job which is less money but more security
B	yeah
A	yep
B	this is yeah this is the bridge
A	the bridge that that takes you to the pub
B	to the other side?
A	yeah
B	are there any trolls on this bridge?
A	it's difficult to see when you're driving over this bridge
B	what if there's any trolls?
