D	yeah
C	I was on
F	no?
B	I
B	bit like a biscuit

B	that was the best medal
C	yeah
D	you know if he won bronze you think he'd put it on there?
F	mm yeah
D	that's
C	some people have a penchant for bronze
D	or they think they don't deserve
C	they're not good enough yeah some people have just got
A	I saw something yeah
D	it's supposed to be really good
B	hm?
A	in what in what kind of way like? I don't can't really remember Eddie the Eagle did he always lose?
A	right
F	well he tried
B	well I don't think he'd ever been on a proper ski like proper proper snow
F	no
D	and there was no one else really doing it
F	there's no British
E	it wasn't so much that he was just a loser
E	and there was he didn't have access to a huge slope or anything and he used to practice
F	yeah some
E	and he didn't care whether he came
C	yeah it's kind of like Cool Runnings
A	right
B	there was that African guy
A	oh the African swimmer?
B	no there was an African guy in about two thousand and eight who was the
F	yeah?
A	yeah black swimmer
F	mm
A	in his country he was like the champion
F	yeah
A	but cos like nobody swam
A	no got the wrong bone density for it
D	you said they've got the wrong bone density for it?
A	but they've got like
A	their bone density is different
C	so they've got higher bone density
D	so they
C	but they
A	so they sink
C	yeah but they've got a lot
D	do they make great scuba divers?
C	more fast twitch muscle fibres
D	uhu
C	slow twitch are you know they
B	ever seen a black
F	no
B	there are none
C	seen a few black
B	but that's
B	few
F	ah
E	there is a reason for the like all the Kenyan and African runners
A	oh yeah
E	is because apparently they
E	in order to get enough food to live
F	and is it high altitude as well? so their lung capacity is erm
A	and they just start very very young don't they?
F	yeah
B	I suppose like it's an escape from poverty isn't it?
A	yeah
E	but more than that if you live in Kenya is that
A	I think a lot of them do do it as like a full-time job so whenever it's the Valencia erm
D	good
A	and they and they and I think they just go week to week to different half-marathons and marathons round Europe and take the prize monies
F	in this half-marathon this half-marathon now in Cardiff we have lots of er top athletes coming
D	Mo Farah
F	Mo Farah
A	is he?
F	yeah
E	yeah they took
A	wow
D	hundred what?
F	hundred thousand
E	hundred thousand
F	mm
A	but if you think like it's thirteen and a half miles of streets to line it's quite the space for everybody
F	yeah
D	no cos it's
F	yeah
E	I did the Cardiff marathon four or five times
F	then you're waiting for your second wind
A	yeah? is the route a good one? is it interesting?
E	well it is now but when they first started it
A	ah
E	which was nice but
A	you never want to repeat yourself
F	you don't wanna do it again
E	you there was one stretch in particular where you you
A	yeah
D	yeah
E	you have to go round again and you knew how far it was
A	yeah
E	cos you'd just done it
A	when I did the half-marathon when I got to the halfway point
F	oh
A	and I was like you just won it and I'm literally halfway
F	ah
A	and you've just sprinted all the way round
D	more
A	erm when I cos I did the ten K at the same time so everyone starts together
A	no
A	but
F	yeah
A	cos then people come for a weekend they usually bring their partners
F	yeah we did that we stayed in
A	yeah
F	and me to a
F	a vantage point around the corner you know
E	but we did erm when we first started doing it we used to do like a half-marathon every week or so every couple of weeks
A	yeah
E	it was a hell of a thing
A	yeah
D	just checking out
E	without realising how much
F	oh
A	did you do the London marathon right?
E	yeah four times actually
A	like now
D	four
A	like it's crazy business now to get into it
F	yeah
A	but you can't get into it
A	pardon?
B	two grand'll do it
A	two and a half minimum
D	you've gotta raise a lot of
A	unless you get
F	you didn't have to then did you?
A	unless you're lucky enough to get
B	we saw the guy from Barry come second once
F	and then these people with a
A	yeah
B	how many times we saw that guy do you remember the guy who was running weird
A	oh yeah
B	and I said that's the marathon guy
A	okay
B	came second did he come second or
D	didn't he run it funny?
B	got a really funny
F	very strange
E	all the best runners have
F	strange running pattern hasn't he?
E	they all see they all keep their hands low
A	yeah
A	yeah but
F	mm
A	Mo Farah's a short distance like it's really kind of unfair they've kind of now tried to be like
A	you did five K like
C	what is is that what's his stretch
A	five and ten K
C	oh really?
F	yeah
A	that's what he won at the Olympics and kind of shot him to fame and then after it
A	forty-two
C	and now they're forcing him to go
A	not forcing him
F	forcing him no
A	but
B	good for everyone though
A	yeah
B	good for him to get to
A	but it's just a bit
D	he's going up two weights
A	well it's just completely crazy
D	not straight away though I mean that takes
A	it was no and they didn't give him very long either and then he didn't win the London Marathon everyone was like er
D	come on
A	it was like well you gave him like a year
C	so is he still doing the marathon?
A	I think he's he's still doing marathons and half-marathons
E	well
B	that was delicious that was
A	yeah
E	getting paid to do that
F	well there's fruit
A	yeah but
F	but only little bits of fruit
A	yeah
A	yeah yeah yeah yeah
E	yes nothing to do with
A	I'd go to watch him run
E	yeah
A	it's just fast when you watch the Kenyans run at the front
A	oh my goodness me
D	yeah
A	I just don't know how that's even humanly possible
C	yeah
A	and yeah and knowing that they've kept it up for that amount of time they're not just sprinting that they are well they're sprinting it but
C	well they probably run a hundred metres
A	yeah
E	I remember I did er the Cardiff marathon
A	really? oh he was a massive marathon runner wasn't he?
D	in front or behind?
A	yeah
A	and she like wrapped herself up so no one she like signed up with a kind of neutral name like just her initials
A	cos there was all this stuff where they said that like a woman couldn't do it because her internal organs would just drop out
A	and like there was no place for us to be doing it and stuff which all seems a bit
F	anybody want some fruit?
A	yes please
A	oh those blueberries are enormous
