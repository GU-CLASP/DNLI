[ANNOTATION]	She told speaker C something about worrying.	Entailment
C	you've only got four categories outstanding good
C	room for improvement and special measures
A	yeah
B	why do they keep changing it? don't they?
C	because you could class something as satisfactory
B	mm
C	well isn't that what life is? satisfactory?
A	yeah
C	is life not satisfactory at the end of the day? it has its good points and it has its down points but it's at the end of the day er levels itself out to be

[ANNOTATION]	If you do something stupid you get a stupid badge that you must wear every day.	Neutral
C	that's the case but I dunno no they she's gonna need staff there that can actually handle the kids and deal with the kids
A	yeah
C	and how much more you can put up with if they're
A	really bad
C	you know my year seven you know I don't have my year seven and eights there's a couple of year eights but the majority are alright
A	yeah
C	the year nines
B	mm
C	and I give them the shortest amount of notes that you could ever wanna make

B	mm
C	and it's like this is too much work this is
C	pardon?
A	what are they gonna do when they leave school?
C	pardon? too much work? you've done one page of writing

C	no you have to put up with them
A	can you call the parents in to?
C	mm a lot of parents don't really care
A	no
C	it has no effect on them
A	don't it?
C	they're not
[ANNOTATION]	They think that suspension will help them	Neutral
A	aren't they? well they give the impression that they're fantastic
C	they er they have the space a lot of the schools have that space where you can spread out so you don't see the
A	yeah
A	no
C	you know I had a comment what was it today? what was on the kids'?
A	oh god
B	mm
C	yeah okay I don't think you're actually realising that
B	oh dear
C	this government is actually cutting your benefits
[ANNOTATION]	They think that the schools are very good.	Entailment
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	you know and a lot of them would just rob rob
B	do they still offer money if you for them
C	no that stopped
A	is it?
C	EMA EMA stopped pathetic
[ANNOTATION]	They think something is broken and stopped.	Entailment
A	yeah
B	mm
C	yeah you have to you have to stay on that's the thing now
B	mm
C	it's compulsory that you stay on so as it's compulsory to stay on why should we pay them?
[ANNOTATION]	They have to stay on for it all.	Entailment
A	that's true
B	yeah
A	what was the slogan years ago? education education education
C	they just don't they just don't appreciate it they just do not appreciate it
B	mm
C	you need as many GCSEs as
B	mm
C	so why am I having to do this?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	it's not it's not that you'll need it er it's the way you have you think ain't it? you er
C	yeah
A	it's it's all training your brain ain't it?
C	yeah
A	I mean how many people use algebra? but we had to learn it
B	mm
C	it's just like you know you you've got you've gotta learn it
A	yeah
C	you know you've gotta do it just shut up and get on with it
A	yeah
C	don't make it difficult for yourself don't make it so that you hate it cos if you make it that you hate it then it's
A	yeah that is a problem that is ain't it
C	you know
A	and and when they get together talking about it that's where it
C	yeah
A	all go pear-shaped ain't it?
C	yeah
A	cos they say oh why should we have to do that?
C	yeah
B	mm
A	and they all create a a sort of a
C	mm yeah and they just push it and then and then if you are firm in the sense that no you don't do that this is what you need to be doing it's like oh it's boring in here isn't it?
A	yeah
C	you can't mess about
B	oh
A	well when we were when I was at school
B	and you'd be like till you left school
A	yeah but when I was at school all the disruptive children were taken out
B	mm
A	and that they were streamed right down to D stream but
C	yeah I mean there's there's not it's just this I don't wanna go to this lesson so I'll walk off
A	yeah
C	and it's and it's got and it's gone how it used to be
A	yeah
C	I don't think they
A	no
C	twenty-four twenty-four million pound building and you've got no walls on your classroom
B	yes
A	that's a bit er stupid ain't it?
C	your breakout space is well sorry breakout spaces are not
B	well over the years they must've had so
C	you know so why?
B	and then they
C	one one one group of one group of erm academies want it one way and one group of academies want it another way
A	yeah
C	you know
B	yeah
C	why? cos the kids cos
A	mm
C	because A it causes problems cos when the kids walk across it they drop things over the top and it's all the way down
A	that's right yeah
C	right? so and that that's and that wasn't a problem but that's started to be a problem
A	yeah
C	erm
A	well of course they did yeah
B	mm
C	you know little things little things like that
A	yeah
B	like you say there's nothing wall space you could put anything
C	got no wall
A	no
B	mm
A	that's a bit stupid ain't it?
B	mm
A	open plan
C	you know so when the so our lessons are usually like two hours or an hour and a half so when there's a changeover lesson you get all the noise and you might get a a student who's being silly come into your classroom
A	yeah
A	that's a bit
B	I thought they were you know cos you complained about it didn't you?
C	yeah
B	built the academy and then
C	I
B	they haven't changed it then?
C	no this great big
A	oh dear
B	mm
C	trying to teach them with a great big projector you're still gonna need three staff in there
A	yeah
C	to get all the way round
B	yeah
C	so they
C	so
B	they cost millions these academies
A	really?
C	and they're happy to make people redundant
A	what?
B	mm
C	is that not? you're not supposed to be making a profit in education
A	no
B	mm
C	but sitting on one
A	well how come how do they make? well they get allocated so much money
C	they're just not spending it
A	and they don't spend it
B	yeah
A	that's very strange because er er years ago each er
C	mm
A	so they just spent it all
C	yeah
A	you know they had this that and the other don't they? built some lovely places you know and they built good houses because they spent it all I mean you only gotta go round
C	yeah
C	yeah
A	because they had the money
C	it used to be the same in education you used to have to if you hadn't spent your budget by the end of the year
A	yeah you get
C	used to be taken off and then it used to be reallocated
A	yeah that's right
B	yeah so that's not the case any more at all?
A	but now you don't have to spend it?
C	no well we're probably
B	they just keep the money
A	yeah
B	mm
A	it is a weird system
A	really?
C	mm
A	will she? yeah
C	oh I can just see it well she

A	well we got
B	mm
A	I don't see how that'd work out if you want to put any boarding down
C	you can't can you?
A	no
C	but the boarding will lag it though won't it?
A	that would do yeah yeah
C	boarding would lag it
A	you can buy the special boarding now with the fibre on one side with the with the aluminium foil so it'll reflect all the heat back now
C	mm
A	well when you think about heat rising anyway

B	yeah
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	the kids want to come to school on Saturdays	Neutral
C	er part of me was thinking well I haven't gotta sell the house
A	yeah
B	mm
C	I can do things in the house to a point that I wanna do
A	yeah
C	so I could decorate it and I could and then I could spend time in the garden putting stuff in the garden putting plants in
B	mm
A	yeah
C	and part of me was saying yeah and I and I can
B	yeah
C	you know make it make it as I say a home although it is a home but make it more of a home
A	yeah nice yeah
B	mm
[ANNOTATION]	the decoration is handmade	Neutral
C	and I thought well I'll have a new carpet in my bedroom cos I
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	speaker C has a new carpet in the bedroom	Contradiction
A	yeah
B	so what if you took off a period of time under stress again? would you get full pay?
C	yeah I'd get full pay for six months
B	mm would that be a good idea to do for a little while?
C	no
B	no?
C	cos it's not it's not
A	it don't bode well for the future does it? you know
B	well I know it doesn't but if it gets
C	yeah but it but it isn't because er
B	mm
[ANNOTATION]	speaker C will get only half the payment	Contradiction
C	having that I still have to pay the bills and all the other bits and pieces even though I'm paying six months I've still gotta pay the bills etcetera
A	mm
B	yes but
C	yeah but my full pay doesn't cover what I'm having to pay out
A	no
C	each month
[ANNOTATION]	the bills amount will increase	Neutral
A	no
C	and they've er
A	yeah
C	so I know what I'd have but
B	mm
C	it's just it's you know and each month is each month is getting easier to a point because I'm paying things off but there's gonna be a point where I have no money to pay those things off
B	mm
A	yeah
C	and my salary doesn't and my salary doesn't won't cover it
A	no huh
B	mm
C	so
A	yeah
B	mm
C	so my next my next my next thing really is
A	mm
C	which would be er which would be alright
A	yeah yeah
C	no no no the the least I can have is what I need to cover my mortgage
A	yeah
C	but if I have that I have nothing
C	and considering I've paid for the last twenty odd years
B	mm
A	yeah
C	so I need I need er you know I need to cover at least two sixty
A	yeah
C	if I
A	well
C	that would be that would be my next that'd be my next thing
A	yeah
C	so
B	mm
C	so I don't
A	still got lots of thinking to do
B	mm mm
C	and if I was made redundant I wouldn't get that much
C	I'd only get three years
A	yeah you would now wouldn't you? yeah
C	cos A there's been a break in service
A	yeah
C	when I wasn't working
A	yeah
C	if there hadn't've been that break in that service then I could've had the last twenty-
A	yeah
C	redundancy
C	well there's a maximum you can have
A	well course there is yeah
C	er maximum is thirty thousand so
A	no no you can't
C	mm dunno
C	buying and selling
B	mm
A	well you could sell yourself
B	like people do
A	you could sell yourself
C	mm
C	I don't think so somehow wouldn't get much
B	mm
C	I don't know
B	mm
C	I can't
B	oh no course you can't
C	no I have thought about I have thought about that the only
A	oh yeah you could get a lodger
B	there is that
C	mm
B	do you know anyone who wants to rent?
C	no
B	mm
A	you'll have to find a woman
C	that's not the answer
B	be difficult when you've got children in the house
A	or you could find a nice boy
B	mm
A	that'd be alright
B	mm not really
C	no
B	mm
A	yep
C	or
A	yeah well let's hope you get the position
B	yeah
C	I then have to do a bit of renegotiation
A	yeah
B	mm
C	see if I can do a bit of renegotiation
B	mm
A	or win the lottery
C	or win the lottery
A	will it? well that'll be something what's that? a personal loan or something?
C	mm
A	yeah?
C	mm
A	then you can get another one
C	what I could
C	what I could possibly do is renegotiate the other personal loan that I've got so that I spread it over so it gets a smaller amount
A	oh right yeah how many personal loans do you have? I thought
C	no all in the same bank
A	oh right
B	oh
C	because I had I took a loan out one year
A	did you?
C	mm
B	mm right
C	and at the time it was alright cos I could afford it
B	mm
A	yeah
B	mm
C	three years
A	yeah yeah
C	if I hadn't had to've been paying those
B	yeah
C	what I got as a compromise deal would've been alright
A	yeah
C	cos I've been using that to top it up
A	yeah
A	you did yeah
C	so I'm you know I
A	yeah
B	mm
A	got any premium bonds?
C	don't have any premium bonds well I do but
C	they've never won anything

C	I have got some premium bonds but I don't know what the numbers are
A	you might've won something
C	I don't know what the premium I don't know what the numbers are they keep the money though don't they?
A	they keep the money for a little while
B	mm
C	twenty thousand would be enough
A	yeah well you might've even won it though
B	mm
A	no
C	thirty would be good
B	mm
B	if you had a
A	well er I know what he'd do
A	he'd he'd put he'd put a load into
C	I'd pay my
A	yeah
C	I'd pay my mortgage off I'd give
A	yeah
C	like starter homes type thing
A	yeah
B	mm
C	and I would rent them out
A	yeah
B	mm
C	and what they got for rent on them would be their money
A	yeah
C	until they wanted to move into them
B	mm
A	we had the chance a few years ago
B	mm
A	when we sold that house down the road there we got forty-five thousand for it right?

A	so yeah
C	you know
B	yeah
A	yeah yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	mm
C	but you know if when I put it on the market at three forty I was expecting to get at least three ten for it
