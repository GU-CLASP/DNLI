B	oh
D	I must admit
A	mm well to be honest

D	you have to
A	mm
D	or not lied that's the wrong word not telling the
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	two people will be honest	Entailment

A	they lived in
D	oh right

B	I landed at ten
D	in the morning?
B	yeah
D	and what time did the daughter land nine?
B	well she landed at nine but she took so long to get through customs that she actually came out just before me so it worked out perfectly
A	yeah cos she's not
B	anyway
A	she I mean you said the
B	yeah
D	oh so
A	yeah
D	she had to go through oh right
A	yeah
D	yeah
B	they did stop me actually they said excuse me do you have any erm alcohol in that bag? and I said cos I had all those things presents didn't I?
A	oh yeah?
B	I said oh yeah I have a little bit
B	they obviously couldn't be bothered that day
D	cos I must admit you when you go through and you think oh I've got two hundred I've got
B	yeah I'm always yeah
D	twenty fags too many
A	yeah
D	cos you've got
A	yeah
D	a packet
A	mm
D	and there's nobody there
A	yeah
D	don't they? and they know what flights
A	anyway so so
B	yes
A	the rest of the story
D	and was she in a good mood?
B	she was in a really good mood and really happy we'd done all our stockings and everything and we erm yeah so everyone was in a good mood a nice mood and then
B	and she like
[ANNOTATION]	They were in good mood	Neutral
B	and she hadn't seen her for six months as well had she?
A	no
B	and she like screaming at
D	what and
B	yeah
A	well he asked what time to wake me up
B	but she didn't even listen to what
A	so I'd be up and all ready by the time they got here you know
B	but
D	you shouldn't what?
B	eat starch cos she'd been eating crisps beforehand
A	yeah she was quite
B	and then she flipped into into happy jolly mode again and we had
B	a happy jolly journey back
[ANNOTATION]	they were happy about the journey	Neutral
D	oh
B	it was all dad's fault we had a very uncomfortable
B	I was just sitting there while she was screaming at
D	well what does
A	he
B	he doesn't
A	he doesn't he just tries to placate her well er that's why
D	she don't like he does she?
A	no they're not really
[ANNOTATION]	She was not in good mood	Contradiction
D	I mean the trouble is that they're
A	I I'm sure she's slightly bipolar
B	this was a few years ago wasn't it
A	years ago it was after dad died I think it was the first Christmas the
B	so
[ANNOTATION]	she has bipolar disorder	Entailment
A	yeah
B	cos he was only a baby
A	they went out
D	his family and his wife
A	you know his family upstairs and and
A	just sat on the porch with her suitcase
D	oh they went to Canada?
[ANNOTATION]	His family and his wife traveled	Neutral
A	yeah this was in Canada
D	oh sorry I thought you meant France
A	yeah and erm they couldn't you know
D	does your mum get your mum gets on with her though doesn't she?
A	yeah
D	you wouldn't see them would you?
A	it would drive a wedge between
[ANNOTATION]	he thought it was France but Canada	Neutral
D	how did he meet her?
A	through work
D	in Canada or
A	he was working in Canada on something some and he met her there
D	never forgiven her for what? for like
A	well oh for that and
D	to be treated like that
A	and also on one occasion
B	used the wrong dishcloth or something
A	used the wrong
B	I don't know
A	utensil or kitchen utensil for something or other and
D	over a dishcloth?
A	oh it was something that
B	really small yeah
A	it was something in the kitchen
A	be civil to
D	mm
A	after that cos she said I never ever got an apology she said I did get an email erm
D	what are you looking for love?
A	about a year later
C	glasses
A	which referred to that Christmas and it wasn't an apology but it was and she thought well that's the best I'm gonna get
D	but the trouble is is
D	yeah because they
A	mm
D	like it's fun and upbeat if she's
A	mm yeah
D	in the right mood
A	but that's that that Christmassy thing and that thing where she just
B	yes she does she flips
A	you can't be slightly bipolar you're either bipolar
B	she flips
A	or you're not aren't you but
D	the trouble is
A	yeah
D	you've gotta remember alright she speaks English and everything but she comes from a different she comes from Canada
A	mm
D	they have different ideas they're
A	yeah
D	all very I don't know
A	yeah
D	their
A	yeah but surely all Canadians aren't crazy like that
D	no then most I mean she most probably has got some sort of
D	yeah
A	mm
D	cos like erm I didn't realise
A	mm
D	before he met
A	yeah
D	and erm she had a
A	oh right
D	mm I never knew this child existed and apparently he lives in erm
A	mm
D	and er he contacted
A	right
D	and he said I don't suppose you're my dad are you?
A	oh
D	he was born in
A	oh
D	erm his dad again and erm and it was
A	mm
D	so
D	and whatever
A	mm
D	and
A	mm
D	with loads of information just tell him that
A	mm
D	what you've done just a little résumé of your life and if you wanna know anything and apparently his first wife died
A	oh
D	and er
A	right
D	well
A	mm
D	and you can stay with us
A	yeah
D	and because he never made a thing of it
A	mm
D	that they presume that you're gonna invite them to stay they presume
A	mm
D	that you're
A	well what do mean though cos he didn't make a great big thing of it? cos he didn't say oh thank you very much and or or
B	oh my goodness
A	and all that?
D	yeah
A	oh
D	so he's not bothered with him anymore
A	he sounds like a complete dick
D	well he is sometimes

D	he can be
A	yeah mm
B	has everyone had breakfast?
A	no I'm waiting for your dad I'm gonna start cooking in a minute

A	you've never got any money ever
B	it's not I do but it's in my pot
A	never ever
B	but it's in my pot that I have to smash
A	yeah
B	I don't wanna smash it
A	so you've got all your money you've put in your pot that you have to smash so you've never got any available funds
B	yeah otherwise I'd never
D	what pot you've got to smash?
B	well for Christmas I got you know these Italian style pots that you get and you have to smash
D	oh and you have to smash it like
B	them open on the floor?
D	a wedding or whatever
B	yeah so I I erm put all my spare coins in there so I never have any change on me
B	and mum gets really annoyed
D	how much is in there do you know?
B	I don't know I've been doing it since Christmas just as and when putting a few pounds in probably haven't got that much in it yet probably it's gonna take me a few years to
D	they do hold quite cos they've got like a
A	yeah with all the
A	no I reckon if you fill it only with two pound coins when it's full it'll be a thousand pounds
D	two pound coins?
A	mm
D	you see I don't get many two pound coins really
A	my friend
B	no
A	she's always buying my two pound coins she puts them all in one of those
D	yeah
A	and she's always she buys two pound coins off people if I've got any she goes oh
B	I'll just I
D	we collect twenty Ps in that little chicken on the windowsill in the kitchen and every time there's ten pound in it we bag that up
B	yeah but it's
D	and erm when we went to er
B	okay same as me
A	and he
B	why?
A	I don't know
B	well I went for it and they refused me cos I
D	why?
B	haven't been in the country for three months yet so I can reapply on the twenty-fifth of March cos that's three months from when I got back from Peru
D	oh right yeah
B	yeah
D	well he won't for whatever reason
A	yeah
D	he got made redundant erm he's got a couple of little pensions but he won't go down and sign on because he doesn't
B	okay
D	he's got high blood pressure he gets very very stressed and to sit in a job interview would just make him
B	so he'd never get a job then? if he can't sit in a
D	he most probably wouldn't
B	yeah
D	because he's really nervous and agitated plus
B	what is she a nurse?
D	auxiliary
B	what's auxiliary?
D	just like a carer
B	okay
D	unqualified so she gets quite good money cos it's time and thirty a time and sixty percent for the weekend

D	and er and I said oh
B	oh my god
D	and he kept coming went now
B	yeah but he's not getting any money for him is he?

D	and he went here you are there's them here's your
B	yeah
D	here's your twenty Ps give us two quid's worth he give us two quid's worth and he's just putting it in his pocket and I was thinking hold on a minute that's my friend's money

D	is that a dressing gown?
A	that is
B	oh okay
A	moneybox holiday fund
B	oh right
A	change it all up into pound coins and that will go in the money
B	that's a good idea
A	no but it's full of twenty Ps and
B	we need to
A	swapping all the twenty Ps
A	right see you in a minute
B	yes if I have change in my purse I'll just spend it on something so that's why I always just come home and just put it straight in there
