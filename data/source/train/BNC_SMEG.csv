B	has the computer got to pick this up in this?
A	sorry?
B	has the computer got to pick pick this up or does somebody sit and listen to it and?
A	do you know what
B	mm
A	I know it must be a a very painstaking job if they have to
B	mm
A	but mm
B	yeah
A	oh I wish it would last forever
B	yeah yeah it's lovely
A	did you  Did you  have a good weekend? Did you enjoy the sun?
B	erm
A	mm
B	no no no we thought about it because
A	oh no were you busy?
B	no not really
A	mm
B	that's what's so annoying cos when it's really sunny and it's not that busy and you're not really doing anything you just think oh you know you open all day for nothing but
A	mm they'll be at home
B	mm
A	yeah yeah
B	Cos you do you know if it's quiet we've still you've still got to pay all the overheads
A	definitely
B	so it is worrying
A	oh no
B	it's horrible but what can you do?
A	yeah no I get that sometimes you waking up and worrying and your brain won't stop and
B	mm
A	gosh
B	yeah they don't necessarily come out in bad weather either I don't think
A	mm
B	you know you can't
A	mhm
B	but you don't know when that's going to end and when are people going to come out again and?
A	yeah yeah
B	you know and if that's like going to be if this continues
A	uh huh
B	it's next Friday's Good Friday
A	we're still in March aren't we?
B	mm
A	okay so it's next
B	yeah
A	the Friday and the Monday
B	well of course Easter's always quiet anyway so then you think well okay so
A	mhm
B	and then if the good weather continues after that I don't know it's just  it's just  I don't know
A	mm
B	it's not like that
A	yeah yeah
B	and just you know everybody knows that the people are struggling and you know like small independent retailers they're like struggling and all that
A	mm
B	and then like we had the rates bill and the rates have gone up and
A	yeah
B	it's like
A	that's so much
B	I know
A	Cos it was a cold winter as well everyone had their heating on all the time and they've been whacked with huge bills and
B	mm
A	where are people getting the money to pay for it? It's
B	I know it's worrying
A	mm
B	we we lose it to the erm internet
A	really?
B	yeah yeah
A	right
B	so they don't have to do anything
A	oh no
B	and of course you can't compete with it because they haven't got the overheads that we've got
A	yeah
B	yeah well we've just erm we've just got
A	uh huh
B	in fact we've just got the that's that's the first bill
A	mhm
B	but it's good
A	mm
B	because you need
A	mhm
B	but if there's million of well you know e-commerce websites
A	yeah yeah
B	they can't
A	mm
B	so but we are going to try and do that but I don't know
A	and how about on eBay?
B	yeah we thought about eBay but erm there's certain restrictions with certain erm people that we deal with
A	mhm
B	and er and also me not
A	right
B	so then what do you buy? And what do you stock? And where do you stock it? And I mean it's always a nightmare in here
A	mm
B	and but we know that people on eBay don't do that
A	really?
B	yeah cos we try we tried to get some fabric once from a supplier and erm they'd sold out but somebody on E-Bay was advertising it so we thought well they must have the stock
A	mhm
B	erm because you have to on eBay
A	yeah
B	so erm we thought well we're going to have to get it
A	they're ordering it from the same company that you were ordering it from?
B	yeah and the company
B	I know
A	yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
B	you feel like you want to contact eBay and say these people aren't operating within your rules
A	mhm
B	because they haven't got the stock
A	yeah yeah
B	you you look and try and find a number for eBay
A	mhm
B	yeah right
A	to
B	oh really
A	but they got he got as letter from a debt collecting agency saying that they were going to come round and collect the money for this random that we don't know
B	yeah yeah right
A	through E-Bay
B	yeah right
A	but no
B	no no
A	yeah I know
B	erm my er nephew erm he my sister's just had erm
A	mhm
B	my nephew's never stayed in Travel Lodge
A	uh huh
B	but basically they damaged the room
A	oh no
B	I don't know what it is
A	oh no
B	he's never stayed in Travel Lodge
A	mm
B	and er then they said they'd got erm a driving licence number
A	how weird
B	I know
A	mhm
B	erm but I don't know what has happened
A	very bizarre
B	I I don't think erm
A	I think some do some don't
B	yeah like I think they
A	mm
B	yeah yeah
A	mm
B	but I said to her you do need to speak to Citizens' Advice or something and just ask them
A	yeah
B	and I don't know how it works with driving license like if they've got all the same numbers but I mean there's probably thousands of people that have got all the first numbers are the same
A	no it's weird it's that all of the digits are the same apart from the last four
B	mm
A	I know isn't it a shame? Such a shame when you think back to you know how communities used to operate and everyone used to know each other and they'd be a lot more
B	mm
A	it's such a shame
B	I think it's just easier for it to happen though isn't it?
A	yeah
B	mm
A	and I was thinking well I've never used a company called Shopping Discounts and especially not every month
B	no I haven't heard of them but er
A	no but they erm they basically they're a a company that offer online discounts
B	mm
A	erm so if you as a company want to discount you've got lots of stock that you want to get rid of you contact this company and say put a special offer out to your members that gives them a very reduced price in all their stuff
B	mm
A	erm so their members of of Shoppers Discounts erm pay a certain amount every month in order to get the information about all these discounts
B	mm
A	but obviously you know I'd never signed up to this
B	you'd agreed for
A	in the end I got it back but they were  they were  evil about it
B	mm
A	they were no we didn't you know I was
B	mm
A	it was never made er covert or clear what was going on
B	clear yeah mm
A	you're going to be fifty?
B	yeah
A	no
B	like I'm willing to try anything do you know what I mean so I thought I'll have a free sample of that
A	uh huh
B	and I'm not quite sure what they are but I had heard of them
A	yeah
B	but nothing came up so I thought well that's a bit strange
A	uh huh
B	but this was all through this Supersavvyme er website
A	mhm
B	but of course now I'm getting emails every single day from Supersavvyme
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	so all they've done is
A	they collected your email
B	they've got me to go in
A	oh yeah
B	so I've tried to email them back to these things to say actually I only registered with you for a sample and you've conned me into registering with you and now you're emailing me every day
A	mm
B	and there's nothing
A	can you not get onto the site? And or is there nothing in the email that says click on this link to
B	it might say yeah to stop receiving it
A	yeah
B	there might be something on there but I wanted to have my say about the fact that I'd felt like I'd been conned to do it by this free sample offer
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	which obviously clearly didn't exist
A	it's so cheeky
B	disgusting
A	totally
B	but you just I suppose cos you know coming in here as well and then if you feel like those things happen in your personal life but then when you're at work as well and you've got people coming in
A	mhm
B	that are just coming in for information
A	mhm
B	and you just feel like you start to feel a bit paranoid
A	oh no
B	and like I know a lady came in here the other day and I know she's been in here before and never ordered anything from us and then she said she was going to order this wall paper for her
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	she's borrowed our books
A	what's the point? It's all futile isn't it
B	well cos you never really kind of how how often that happens either because people just say oh well yeah I'll come back to you and you don't monitor it and people just don't you know and you don't know whether they're going and buying it on the internet or
A	mhm
B	but the internet is just sickening cos they're just not doing anything for it at all
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	yeah
C	that came in yesterday
[ANNOTATION]	that came in the day before	Entailment
B	oh okay
A	watch out it might be a scam
C	no no no she was the girl from the shop so
B	oh that's good
C	I mean it's quite a good deal
B	I mean I have
C	only only for a one off yeah
B	but it's
B	blow dry
C	exactly
B	no that's good for er that kind of salon isn't it
C	do you want it cos I won't use it?
[ANNOTATION]	internet offers good deals	Neutral
A	I
B	well could you do mine for me? I'll give you a fiver
[ANNOTATION]	it is worth 5 pounds	Contradiction
A	I can't I can't afford twenty-five pounds on a haircut at the moment it's just too
B	I mean I used to go to one by the doctors where I worked which is a bit of a cheaper one but that's just not practical for me now
A	gosh
B	so erm you know it's I can't
C	yeah you can't fit it in
A	oh thank you
C	I was going to ask what colour it was
A	ah you see I do the hairdressing and dental tourism
C	right
A	so I go to the dentist when I'm in Spain
C	uh huh
A	and the hairdressers as well because they they just so much less over there
C	yeah yeah they do
A	yeah yeah
B	and it's all so much cheaper
[ANNOTATION]	dentists are cheaper in Spain	Entailment
C	everything's so much cheaper
A	I think I got my hair cut and the colour put in for about all in all thirty-five pounds which is amazing
B	that's good isn't it?
C	but no it's nice cos you're quite dark
[ANNOTATION]	dark hair looks better	Contradiction
A	mhm yeah you can see my roots now
C	no no no well my roots are grey but I mean you you're quite dark and I every time I go I keep saying I want to be a dirty blonde
A	uh huh
C	I don't mean a dirty blonde
A	do they give you weird stares?
C	no no no she knows what I mean
[ANNOTATION]	they gave weird shades	Contradiction
A	dubious
B	yeah
C	she tries to put blonde but it always like because I've come back from the sun now it's it's gone really red and really fair
A	uh huh
C	and she said  she said  I'm the cheapest streaky person she's ever had because all she does is she does the roots to darken it back up again
A	uh huh
C	and she pulls some of the root colour through
A	uh huh
C	so all these red streaks are from the original one that I got done sort of two or three years ago
A	oh okay
C	so it works out well
A	right
B	it's erm sort of Jennifer Aniston's kind of erm base colour isn't it?
A	California beachy
C	yeah
A	but er no I went in and I said please
C	oh God you've not got any grey hairs
A	oh I have I have
B	yeah she's got a couple I can see them
A	so she went and put platinum blonde like that looked grey itself in it
C	mm mm
B	you need like a yeah you needed more like a honey blonde didn't you really?
A	yeah
C	mm mm
A	and so she put in dark brown highlights to to mask it
B	oh right low light low lights
A	yeah
C	yeah yeah
A	no of course I guess yeah high lights
B	yeah
C	mm mm
A	so I've got a quite quite a hotchpotch of colours in there at the moment
B	yeah you can
C	yeah the different colours
A	yeah
C	so you have to keep going whenever you want your
A	well yeah now I'm thinking oh dear you can see that bit on the top of my head
C	yeah where abouts in Lanzarote were you?
A	erm Costa Teguise
C	yeah my sister goes there all the time
A	oh yeah
C	and that was erm
A	uh huh
C	Cos I didn't like Puerto Del Carmen at all
B	I've never been
C	busy for me
A	yeah
B	yeah that's good business
C	so this is no good to anyone then?
A	oh thank you though
B	erm oh I'm sure I could find somebody yeah
B	I suppose so yeah
C	yeah it's a one off
B	well I'll hang on to it because there's bound to be somebody else anyway isn't there you know so yeah
A	maybe
B	yeah
A	mhm
B	and erm I wanted it straight and smooth and it was terrible
A	yeah
B	by the time I got home it was all over the place so erm and I told erm
A	oh no
B	and er he said oh that's okay just come back in and like we'll we'll do it again for you you know another time for free and so I did do that
A	mm
B	you know you just go in and it's just like really busy and hectic and and but
B	and he's ever such a nice guy
A	uh huh
B	well there's one upstairs here isn't there? There's one above us
A	oh wow
B	yeah and well I've got a
A	is there a barbers?
B	oh the barbers of course yeah yeah
A	that's quite a lot for a small little parade
B	yeah I know
A	oh well better having that than three restaurants
B	yeah yeah
A	oh gosh
B	like we did before
A	oh really? Was there another one?
B	yeah yeah on the end
A	really?
B	yeah
A	was that before the flower shop was there?
B	yeah
A	mm
B	yeah it was immediately before the flower shop
A	I bet you were glad that he he went
B	yeah
A	really?
B	A lot of people are still trying to find him
A	oh really
B	yeah we get phone calls yeah
A	really
B	so we told them
A	oh dear
B	erm I don't know what he does
A	really
B	yeah
A	I guess that was
B	erm yeah I suppose it  I suppose it  would have been wouldn't it? Yeah I mean I don't really like know much about who owns these shops and that and who owns what but erm yeah I suppose it would have been
A	yeah
B	yeah well erm
A	mm
B	you're two doors away from Lakeside Interiors and they're long standing
A	mm
B	and then of course so they were getting more and more cross
A	oh deary me
B	her she was absolutely vile
A	what kind of trouble?
B	just erm because they couldn't get an account
A	uh huh
B	and so they thought it was us that we
A	uh huh
B	anyway I waited till the customers had gone
A	mhm
B	at of any sort
A	mhm
B	so erm I went round and he was there as well
A	mm
B	but they'd made a mistake basically
A	oh right
B	and er I just picked up this hanger off the desk and I went er I said you're speaking to the wrong people like it was like a company like that
A	mhm
B	and erm anyway she started
A	no
B	yeah
B	yeah they
A	mm
B	but er I said no
A	yeah
B	and she's horrible
A	yeah
B	and erm so anyway but anyway they went eventually so
A	Good riddance
unknown_female	hiya
B	it might be best if
A	yeah sure
B	erm I did erm ten
A	uh-huh
B	and it's all to do with
A	uh-huh
B	it's all very mercenaries
A	yes
B	and er but I I'd liked all of that so I have to go through everything and pick out the important stuff and erm so it's quite intense really
A	mm mm
B	yeah yeah yeah everything
A	mm mm
B	because I'd you'd I do it for all the information that's coming in for current patients but I do it for erm new patients as well so every time a new patient comes in I put all of that information on
A	mm mm
B	and there's previous summaries from other surgeries that I can just scan through and pick out the
A	mm mm
B	and of course some of the files they can be
A	oh
B	especially if there's erm drug problems or mental health problems and that they usually a lot of er paperwork for that sort of thing
A	uh-huh
B	so of course it's quite intense
B	and I I'd only got some crackers on me so I thought okay
A	mm mm
B	because it was mainly for the girls on the desk and I don't do any deskwork
A	no
B	but there was just this thing in it that was just because it was about managing customers and dealing with situations and all sorts of things and there was just a couple of things that were really relevant to here
A	uh-huh
B	and I just thought that's really interesting I must remember to tell Steve that which I probably won't take any notice but
A	ah
B	it's about how
A	uh-huh
B	and there's been research done on it and it's been proven that that's what people do because it's in their nature to do it
A	okay
B	so they'll always pick the bet scenario for them
A	uh-huh
B	so but I won't say it now cos I'll tell Steve in a minute
A	uh-huh
B	all day Tuesday and any extra hours that erm I need to do
A	write it down
B	I'm going to go in on
A	is that extra to your hours that they pay you or?
B	yeah yeah
A	oh okay
B	the female doctor
A	mm mm
B	but they have them doing it full time
A	mm mm
B	so of course they're trying to get me to squeeze it into like eight or nine hours
A	right
B	but of course because it's so mercenary and because it all it is all about the money erm they don't really want to pay over time so I have this constant battle where I'm told well just come in if you need to do it
A	urgh
B	you know and it's er
A	oh gosh
B	yeah
A	what do you think of all this NHS reform?
B	I don't you know I I don't know
A	mm mm
B	because I hear the arguments for it and I think well actually yeah they've got good points there and erm that will be good
A	mhm
B	and then I can't weigh it up and I don't know
A	mm
B	but I tell you what I do know
A	mm
B	and erm that er that might affect what they do for people
A	mm
B	because of the cost
A	yeah
B	and I don't know because I don't know what that means in terms of them having control of the money and their incomes
A	mhm
B	because obviously they get basics but then they get extras for things they do
A	mhm
B	yeah
A	mm mm
B	I you know
A	crazy isn't it?
B	so I think er you know at our place it wouldn't necessarily be a good thing
A	really?
B	but the doctors where I go I couldn't imagine them being like that and maybe it would be  would be  would be a good thing for them
A	mm it depends if they have integrity if they really have the vocation of a doctor to heal people or whether they're in it for the money
B	terrible
A	really?
B	it never ceases to amaze me
A	crickey
A	mm mm
A	uh-huh
B	this is erm anonymous isn't it?
A	yes it is don't worry
unknown_female	here you are darling
A	oh thank you
B	thanks
E	there you are weirdo
A	yeah
E	no sugar no milk
B	so erm you know it's er but I mean I I think that they do need to get rid of some of that that like kind of erm the different levels of
A	mhm
B	so if you've got things in place with your trust you're either on a red light or you're on an amber light or you're on a green light
A	mhm
B	and part of what I used to used to involve erm cos it was all about service improvement
A	mhm
B	so obviously I used to go along to all of those
A	oh right you have to justify every single thing
B	and they'd be about four or five of us but we'd be from different aspects of the service
A	uh-huh
B	and we'd have to say yeah okay well this is where we are now with this and this is what we're doing
A	what are PCTs?
B	primary Care Trusts
A	oh okay
B	and that's what they're doing you see
A	what are the Primary Care Trusts? Are like er
B	they er they're the ones that control the money at the moment but cos that's what they're trying to get rid of
A	oh right yeah
B	I suppose so yeah yeah
A	comparison with education yeah
B	yeah
A	well the same things happening there isn't it
B	yeah
A	too much middle management and
B	yeah cos I mean there's  I mean there's  a couple of other bodies as well that we used to have to deal with and erm it you never quite know
A	yeah
B	and er so anyway I but I in terms of where I work I don't thinks it's going to be a good thing
A	oh dear
B	and I mean just the way that you hear them talk sometimes
A	mhm
B	and just some of the conversations you hear are just
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	my doctor's lovely
A	yeah
B	can't imagine my doctor every being like those guys
A	really?
B	I mean my doctor's a human being
A	well I think it's a a common disease nowadays to be mercenary as you said
B	it's that old joke about doctors thinking that they're God or something
A	mm
B	I can really understand how that joke came about
A	yeah
B	mm mm
A	it's okay they have to do a lot more training to get where they are but
B	mm
A	mm
B	what does he get now John?
E	I think it's one sixty
B	is it?
E	I think so
B	and I mean some of them they're not
A	gosh
B	I mean
E	I suppose their argument would be they're saving lives aren't they?
B	you can only work so many hours a week can't you
A	really?
B	you hear of it all the time don't you?
A	mm
B	I know loads of people
A	mm
B	that have been misdiagnosed and
A	yeah yeah
B	things have been missed
A	they're too busy thinking about their money and not about
B	my uncle
A	mm
B	they just want an instant fix for everything
A	mhm
B	rather than just do you know stop at home
A	mhm
B	three days max
A	mhm
B	and that's what's it's like
A	yeah so I guess the doctors have a difficult time
B	and I think that's what it is
A	mhm
B	so what they're starting to do now is some surgeries are saying well what's the consultation for? They don't have to answer it
A	uh-huh
B	but apparently a lot of people do
A	mhm
B	so if they say well I've got a sore throat
A	okay
B	erm so
A	so like use a triage system
B	and try and just er you know either put them off or say well can you go to your chemist and get something? Or can you? I mean they'll be more training for people obviously but erm yeah just trying to cut down the
A	mhm
B	with people coming in with sore throats and you know
A	mhm
B	so there's obviously going to be a big drive to er try and cut it down
A	mhm
B	or the diarrhoea goes or they stop vomiting or whatever then then they get a lot of DNAs because then they don't ring up and cancel their appointment
A	oh
B	so then the DNAs go up
A	yeah yeah
B	so then it was about how to manage the DNAs
A	is that did not attend?
[ANNOTATION]	There is an increase of DNAs.	Entailment
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	they reckon there's a million people a day are DNAing at erm
A	I'm not surprised if they're paying doctors so much money to be there
B	yeah
A	mm
B	which doesn't sound a lot but that's just the doctors
[ANNOTATION]	There are one million people per day.	Entailment
A	right
B	and when they DNA the nurse appointments they're bigger slots
A	mm
B	Cos if somebody's coming in for a smear and it's a twenty minute slot and they DNA it that's twenty minutes of
A	yeah
B	cos it doesn't include nurse appointments
[ANNOTATION]	It doesn't contain appointments with nurses.	Entailment
A	how much? How long are doctors appointments nowadays? Are they supposed to be five minutes?
B	ten ten well they
A	right
B	some surgeries have started to break that down as well now
A	mhm
B	you can have a quick five minute with a duty doctor which is one thing only
A	mhm
B	Cos what a lot of people do is they come in and it's like well actually yeah I've got this pain in my foot and erm I've got this and then I've got this and then I've had this and I've been feeling a bit low just lately and you you look and there's three or four things on the consultation
[ANNOTATION]	Someone can have a short doctor appointment.	Entailment
A	mm
B	erm which is too much for ten minutes
A	mm
B	they're not allowed to come in and start going on about all sorts of other things
A	ah
B	I suppose so yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Ten minutes are not enough.	Contradiction
A	I guess
B	Don't know
A	mhm
B	but then you think about people like my mum and my uncle where they needed those things but didn't ask for them and they weren't sent for them and their things got missed until they got
A	yeah
B	my uncle's terminally ill
A	really
B	because he was bleeding
A	yeah
B	he never pushed for it
A	oh gosh
B	and then my mum
A	oh dear
B	and it started off in her appendix
A	yeah
B	but you know
A	yeah
B	I don't know what it is but you just hear so many stories of erm you know
A	mm
B	but then my mum's
A	hmm
B	so until they MRI scanned her
A	what a shame
B	mm
A	and so he went to the doctors
B	mm
A	then he had to take a toe nail clipping and take it back and that had to be sent off to a lab to see if he actually
B	clippings
A	oh I don't know
B	yeah yeah they have to grow it
A	er
B	and yeah
A	and then
B	Cos people phone up and say well I bought it in a week ago but it they they take a while those
A	right
B	right
A	I'm just thinking
B	mm
A	and do it all over the counter and
B	I mean I think this it what they'll
A	really?
B	they're going to try because it's just
A	mm
B	they had to actually go past their doctors
A	yeah
B	you know and they went to A and E and it you know I mean that's what they get all the time isn't it?
A	gosh
B	and so they're going to try and er do something about it
A	mhm
B	because the A and E appointments
A	yeah yeah
B	I'm not quite sure what they're going to do
A	oh dear
B	Cos people are
A	yeah it's changing peoples attitudes more than anything else isn't it?
B	yeah that's it
A	and how can you do that apart from you know trying to put up posters and trying to educate them
B	mm
A	and if that doesn't work well they're
B	and making them
A	yeah

B	so he said well do you think somebody could just tell him to try and get it done for me this week? So I went no
A	yeah yeah
B	anyway so I said to him erm
A	ah did he phone?
B	I just sat there and I went good luck with that one
A	do you know whether he phoned?
