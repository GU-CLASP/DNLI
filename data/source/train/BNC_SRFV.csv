B	he used he used to take me in there as well
A	what café was it?
B	I can't remember what it was called but again
A	you burnt your arm?
B	I scalded my hand yeah
A	how?
B	er cappuccino went all over it
A	were you drinking a cappuccino?
B	yeah I was
A	I was gonna say how cultured is that mate?
A	get get my son a cappuccino
B	babyccino please
A	how old were you?
B	I think I was about eight seven or eight yeah
A	yeah
B	but luckily because they were so fast they were able to get me a
A	mm
B	to the
A	yeah
B	so yeah I was lucky so there was no scar yeah
A	that's really good
B	yeah
A	when erm when my uncle was a kid he erm someone had put a a tea towel on or they'd rested a pan of scouse on a tea towel like a boiling hot pan of scouse and erm my uncle like pulled the tea towel he was only little like a toddler and he pulled the pan of scouse over the top scald
B	scalded
A	scalding hot I mean he was
B	really?
A	yeah they got again they got if you get if you can get on burns really really quickly like
B	yeah
A	you act instantly then it
B	yeah
A	it's the
B	yeah
A	the longer it's on there erm
B	yeah
A	but you know I I put I put it on the
B	jesus
A	and the inside was still boiling hot
B	how old were you?
A	erm I was old enough to know better
B	jesus
A	and er yeah it it really I was that was like for about a week I had to like I couldn't sleep at night cos the pain was that bad in those fingers so I had to I just had to sit with like I used to sleep with my hand in a cup of water
B	it was that bad?
A	I honestly couldn't bear it it was awful there's nothing you can do really once it's burned they just have to
B	all that from hot toffee
A	hot toffee all that for a toffee sponge or something
A	yeah but
B	I bet I bet that never gets suggested in the bedroom
B	you know how I feel about hot toffee
A	yeah I don't think I
B	I mean I'll show you that book I meant that he's it's quite sad really he wrote fourteen books Vince Flynn the American guy but it
A	didn't I'm trying find
B	he died he died of erm I can't remember was it erm bowel cancer I think
A	really?
B	I think but he yeah
A	how old was he when he died?
B	erm he looked like he I think I don't think there's a picture on that one there was in the first one
A	yeah
B	er he looked to me like he was in his mid-forties
A	I remember
B	or I think he's got some involvement in the government he did have cos in that book at the start he says erm out of respect for the secret service it says patterns and er plans at the White House had been changed
A	yeah
B	so he I think he maybe has been
A	you find a lot of people who have worked in the military
B	yeah
A	make good writers don't they? cos they have that
B	well I is it John le Carré didn't he he was he was Oxford but he he worked for the British intelligence
A	probably yeah
B	is it him I think yeah he's yeah
A	yeah erm you know and Tom Clancy was he ever in the navy or something? was he in?
B	yes but I think he was yeah Navy SEALs I think yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah he's been writing books that I've I've not looked at any but I
A	have you
B	no
A	I mean I it was from his books that when I was when I was kid and I was really into like military stuff you know
B	yeah
A	my dad like when I when I was when I was a bit older my dad gave it to me
B	that was when your dad looked at you and was like that's my boy
A	yeah yeah that was my lad before I became a
A	a a wuss yeah before I became a literary wuss erm
A	like not proud but like
B	associated with yeah
A	like something to talk about isn't it really?
B	yeah
A	but erm so he he used to give me these really like complex spy novels with like
A	an erotic part in it halfway through like some fella comes
B	she
A	yeah like
A	okay
B	it was what you didn't realise it was actually an instruction manual
A	yeah what was the one I was reading? but erm
B	we were talking about actually erm I dunno if noticed I Am Pilgrim that came out came out a few
A	which one?
B	I Am Pilgrim
A	no
B	Terry Hayes I've just finished reading it and that was a spy one but it's a murder mystery as well as a er
A	right
B	well and the interlink sort of erm what do you call it? erm
A	wow
B	erm
A	yeah
B	but then it kind of worked and then at the end when I've read his like but later on he said erm I understand that this is quite a weighty novel and people may seem to think that this is not really appropriate but he said if you're into your what is it? if you're into your hard booze and your quick liquor and stuff then it's maybe not for you but if you don't mind having a bit of a journey then this and I thought
A	yeah
B	do you know what? to be fair
A	yeah
B	just after nine eleven literally I think like a week after or something and there's a woman erm in a bathtub and she's been mutilated like you can't recognise her because her face has been stripped so
A	right
B	basically and
B	you've got his guy who's like you've got this LA cop but then you've got this New York cops and everything and you've got this guy who's kind of no one's mentioned his name but he's the one they're
A	right
B	and then it turns out he's a former like
A	is it a
B	no no no no erm and then basically he gets called back into the service because he's a guy who they call the Saracen
A	the
B	yeah he was mujahideen fighter erm in Afghanistan
A	yeah
B	who's managed to erm make smallpox make a strand of it that erm can't be vaccinated against
A	lovely
B	and so it's er yeah it does sound a bit erm but it's really good
A	I'm not sure this is a book I'd like to pick up right now
A	my anxieties about
B	and it what I think what's quite good is that he does kind of say it in the start which sets it for the rest of the book cos you think come on that's a bit unlikely that you'd find that but he does kind of make a point of it he talks about some of his former cases and he says well that time was pure luck but
A	right
B	that I would have been able to crack any and you think oh right but at the end I don't know who Terry is I recognised their name but erm a lot of the people who contributed who he thanks were like screenwriters and stuff like that
A	wow
B	so I dunno what his
A	maybe he's an actor or
B	yeah
A	a director or something like that
B	maybe give a different name on it I don't know
A	that's cool
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	but it was it was there was like nine hundred pages
B	I know
A	did you read it?
B	yeah yeah
A	bloody hell
B	but it's cos of the work I'm doing and I've got the time I thought whilst I've got the time
A	I think
B	yeah
A	like from mine I used to I used to get a bit annoyed at the staff cos half the time they wouldn't be at the window and when they were there like they'd be there on like Candy Crush Saga on their phones
A	or they'd be reading but then I thought like well I'd be doing the same if
B	yeah
A	cos the way their day was it's like people wouldn't show up every fifteen minutes
B	yeah
A	so you've got that just gaps in your day where there's nothing to do and
A	so there's nothing to do so they just sit and read all day but they must they must get through like
B	yeah well obviously like
A	bloody hell
B	erm
A	you wouldn't
B	I've noticed my speed's been going up the rate at which I read
A	you get you become a better reader I think
B	yeah and I've noticed already in terms of like erm even over in the space of a month I mean I know I I think I forget that like I notice a difference I've studied for the MA for two years I've just come on to reading reading journals er article books that
A	yeah
B	are associated with the social workers I was out of work when I were doing that and I know it's my vocabulary just like sort of
A	it was really good
B	but really structured
B	er not so much now if we were talking but you know when I was writing and I'd look back and sort of go jesus did I write that?
A	yeah
B	erm but even like a month reading like a lot has meant the words that I wouldn't normally use I would go like and also I'm having a better er guess at the meanings of words
A	yeah
B	even though I've I've never really properly read it and then cos
A	yeah
B	well what's I I said oh it was someone who doesn't really show their emotions
A	yeah yeah
B	and blah blah blah and then she guessed yeah yeah I suppose and then she looked at and
A	yeah yeah
B	that was quite nice cos and I think being able to stick the tendencies that we all have I think what's nice with a book is you start something and you finish it and you complete it see what I mean? and it's almost like a mini sort of
A	I I think I have the opposite problem I'm incapable of finishing anything
B	right
A	like a really struggle to finish books I start them I love I
A	I'm very good at starting things and I start with a lot of momentum
B	mm
A	I give it er at the start of a book I will get really into it and get obsessed with it and then when I get I don't like to finish things cos I like to I hate the idea that I'm enjoying something so much and it's
B	yeah
A	gonna be finished
B	yeah
A	you know some books where you're sad when you've finished them?
B	yeah
A	and often I find that if I've really enjoyed a book I'll read it I could read ninety percent of it in the space of a a week or something like that
B	mm
A	and then it'll take me another three weeks to finish fifteen pages because I just
B	yeah
A	won't pick it up cos I don't
B	yeah
A	some books you have to know like
B	well obviously with these
A	the
B	what's gonna yeah
A	but er a lot of the books I read there's no real
B	yeah
A	it's not quite what you want so I guess that's why like I've kind of I've got in the habit and I think since university as well because really oddly when
B	yeah
A	it's it's
B	you take out a chapters at
A	you
B	yeah
A	some so obviously some some some literary study is about the whole novel but very often it's
B	you're almost a bit like a journalist in a sense I suppose then like an editor isn't it? just go and er
A	that's what I tell people
A	when they ask me what I do
B	but it's that's really the same skills isn't it? like
A	it's
B	that's why I've always found it funny when they had like journalism degrees you'd be like but I'm sure the best journalists are not going to uni to do journalism they've been er worked in politics or they've worked in an area
A	yeah
B	linked to something or other
A	the the the big I mean that that's the funny thing about about about journalism as a career I don't I don't I don't claim to know much about it but
B	yeah
A	war zones or they've
B	yeah
A	or they've travelled or they've studied people out of their own interest or they're they're environmentalists and but
B	yeah
A	they haven't
B	so they've got natural passion and flair and knowledge to be able to write like you say like a decent article that's obviously
A	yeah
B	will be get or like or like something you'd do you'd be like proofread it from someone and
A	yeah
B	faults you know to make it more sort of concise but yeah
A	it's like I mean it I mean obviously like I think a lot of people really love him I I've read a few of his books like you know Hunter S Thompson who wrote like Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and things like that?
B	see I watched that film with you guys but
A	no don't
B	I
A	don't don't don't base Hunter S Thompson on
B	I just I
A	the Johnny Depp movie
B	I I think because
A	into drugs
B	or anything like to me it's it's very erm
A	it's unrelatable
B	yeah that's it
A	yeah
B	if anything it I'm quite like
A	I just don't particularly like that film
B	uhu
A	it's and it's it's not and I think I think cos I when I when we lived with like them lot I I kind of got put off it because of you know like they'd watch it like ten times a week and be like ha ha drugs but
B	yeah I think
A	the the point is is that he he was a bit of a you know he he did he did take some strange some strange drugs Hunter S Thompson and
B	yeah
A	time and things like that and
B	cos you never think of that as a well in terms of
A	Ben Stiller?
A	Johnny Depp?
B	yeah erm but you know he cos you cos you were talking about Fear and Loathing in Las Las Vegas
A	yeah
B	erm it but
A	mm
B	and I know I've got a bit of a thing but do you know when I watched that nothing really happens but I loved it
A	but that that's Hunter S Thompson as well
B	is it?
A	no it's not the Rum
B	yeah cos erm I dunno I
A	Rum Diary
B	it it made me think of cos obviously I love rum you know
B	but I dunno it kind of made me thinking thing that could so easily be you
A	me?
B	as in sorry myself
B	no that could be so you could so easily become a
A	pretty
B	cos
A	pretty
B	it's
A	pretty
B	a pattern isn't it?
A	it's it's either Hunter S Thompson or someone equally
B	yeah I know I wasn't on Google
A	I'm just gonna google The Rum Diaries
B	yeah? The
A	the
B	what's he called his name again?
A	Hunter S Thompson
B	Hunter S Thompson
A	in reading?
B	yeah
A	it's one of life's great pleasures
B	it is
A	I'm I'm told
B	it's
B	cos I mean I dunno it's like cos my dad was a big reader and he but he loved he would read Charles Dickens novels constantly
A	really?
B	yeah probably
A	it's it's
B	do you know what I mean? you know
A	they say they say say he's the best Charles Dickens don't they?
B	yeah
A	apparently it's just the best
B	he
A	not quite
B	that's
A	not Scrooged with Bill Murray?
B	no
B	not that one er
A	yeah I know the
B	so I suppose for me now that he's
A	yeah
B	but he's not I suppose reading in a sense is kind of it's a it's a connection in a way I find cos he well he loved reading
A	yeah
B	erm I dunno if it's quite er cos we're only human and we like getting compliments don't we? but there's a new girl started in work
A	yeah
B	and she's from like quite she went to yeah I know went to went to private school you know
A	it's a good school that
B	she's like very well spoken and you know she's a
A	how old is she?
B	erm she's
A	what's her name?
B	yeah very much I'd say I'm sure somewhere in your circle would have known them like you know
A	yeah yeah
B	her father and she's been working with me for about the past month and in initially it's like like the job the joke we had isn't it when we were in uni is that people see me oh right yeah he lives in
A	he's a divvy
B	he yes he is and the other night we were sat there cos she as on a on a
B	and I was like never thought of myself as that and I went well I like I thanks yeah I was just
A	yeah
B	that was quite nice of her to say that
A	I think I have the opposite problem I think people always assume I'm really cultured and I'm really not I'm like I'm really like
A	uncultured
A	I'm not at all like I think
B	if you think about the debates we used to have at you were the only person and I used to love it when we were living in uni and
A	oh yes
B	we'd talk about things for ages do you know what mean? so it's
A	yeah
B	erm do you know what I mean? so I used to love that
A	I dunno I think I I I think I think studying stuff like maybe a bit more cultured I guess but I mean I guess I guess it's a relative term you know it's not like you can can be cultured or not cultured but
B	I think
A	I think I think people often presume that I'm like I'm I think one I think it's like that I think people presume that I'm really really really into like fiction I'm not I like I like reading but I don't really like
B	yeah
A	reading like whole novels that
B	yeah
A	erm
B	well I know now that it's like reading patches
B	patches of it yeah
A	patches of novels
B	yeah
A	bits of novels I like er I I sort of like the ideas of the ideas of things more so if I can
B	see that's funny cos obviously I've come off that path all of I've done that for two years
B	and sick of it yeah so now I wanna you know
A	absolutely sick of it
A	mm
B	and sort of jumping of a plane with a machine gun or a
A	it's like children's novels
A	the spy who can redraw his redraw his
B	Dougal plane yeah I've just thought of a character yeah Dougal
A	just just write a kids' book agent
B	yeah
A	agent doodle pants
A	think of a and he like he and he has
A	penny crayon but he like draws his own surroundings
A	draw his way out of the thing
B	I mean yeah
A	stop recording
A	shit
A	our million dollar idea
A	yeah
B	no it's erm no yeah so it's
A	yeah
B	playing a part whereas to me it's culture is about having social awareness
A	yeah
B	of knowing yourself like I know that I go to the gym cos I like to exercise and keep healthy but also cos I'm body conscious and also because
A	yeah
B	it gives me confidence
A	yeah
B	that's social work but if you do it properly you come away with you go you understand why people the motives rather than
A	yeah yeah
B	like you now oh well they're gonna be set well why are they doing that?
A	yeah
B	what what influenced someone and what what you know what I mean?
A	yeah
B	so then I think once you have an understanding that you better understand people
A	yeah
B	and you know what I mean so it's er
A	yeah I think so
B	yeah
A	I think I think I
B	and knowing when all the like
A	like
B	Diwali holidays are and stuff like
B	do you know what I mean?
A	no but you
B	yeah
A	and he was very well read and it's weird how like you'd think as those things as like somehow opposed
B	classic isn't it?
A	like
B	big screen TV on a working class
A	yeah yeah
B	and isn't yeah
B	yeah
A	class but it's not at all like
B	no
A	and
B	yeah
A	and it was
B	yeah
A	brilliant because like they
B	yeah
A	and they'd be back and then
B	getting the next
A	they'd they'd be there every week
B	one of the author yeah
A	they would they were hooked and
B	yeah
A	I don't know what it was but
B	it's for those clever
A	it yeah it's not for me
B	yeah
A	and then you realise you can understand anything if you you you know if you sit and read something and you're interested in it you can you can get it and that was what was really nice about that job sometimes was like
B	yeah
A	from having a read
B	it
A	is it called is it called Good Will Hunting?
B	no
A	me and
B	has she not?
A	it blew her mind
B	is that what made Ben Affleck then? and it's
A	yeah
B	Matt Damon was it?
A	they got an Oscar for that didn't they?
B	yeah cos they wrote it didn't they?
A	yeah
B	erm
A	but isn't it rumoured that like there's that joke on Family Guy but isn't it rumoured that it was like
B	it was just one of them
A	one it was all Matt Damon
B	oh right yeah
A	and Ben Affleck's just chilling
B	yeah somehow I can see that but
A	yeah
B	yeah erm and then that would be judging erm
A	cos his wicked smart
A	Adam or Adrien there's two
B	the one off The Pianist?
A	Adrien Brody
B	Adrien Brody
A	Adam Brody is the guy from The OC
A	and stuff like that
B	oh it's er oh it does my head in erm
A	what's it called? the film
B	Detachment
A	Detachment
B	it's about a
A	yeah
B	and basically as the film goes on he hates his life he's like
A	right
B	erm and it's so and they're sort of showing the stresses of an inner city school that's you know obviously in quite a deprived area
A	yeah
B	the teachers are getting
A	sounds good that
B	but it's it's on Netflix and I'd definitely watch it
A	Detachment?
B	there's me going
A	yeah
B	but I think you do need sometimes someone who isn't quite well no not to say she's not deep
A	you need to find yourself a
B	but
A	I mean it's a
B	but I would I I would sit there for hours and you know you know talk about something so like
A	yeah yeah
B	current affair like kind of that time when I was saying to you I would have read a read a bit of postmodernism and stuff and you're like
A	yeah yeah
B	and you just said to me
A	yeah
B	and it's funny how a simple sentence like that can make you go yeah it's kind of like and again
A	kind of like a skinny white Buddha
A	essentially
B	that's it yeah so er but that's what I love off
A	yeah yeah
B	and I think that goes well and
A	that's really good
B	I was er three percent off a first and it was pure but do you know what though? you know the most best part? I did all that by myself I did those fifteen thousand words I'd never got my lecturer to look over it or anything or took and
A	that's brilliant
B	most of the people there they were pretty much writing an interesting
A	do do you do you feel like you do you feel like you think you really came on then from your degree
B	yeah
A	to your master's?
B	definitely my degree I was still dealing with my dad
A	yeah
B	definitely I was dealing with the fact that
A	housemates didn't make it easy for you did
B	well no mate if I
A	yeah
B	but also it's er it's been a deliberate path to go and where I am now and then go and do social work and yeah I I'm probably the happiest I am now
A	good
B	it I was
A	yeah
B	it's great in the context you know what I mean? whereas now I'm quite I quite like the fact that you know and yourself and you know everyone's gone off doing their own thing and
A	you're settled
B	that's it yeah and just it's it's it's like it's nice
A	you spend you spend like
B	mm
A	I feel like I'm still trying to like adjust everything and make everything you know like
B	yeah
A	cos uni was so hard for me cos I just you know
B	yeah
A	lost my lost my marbles so
B	I always have it envisaged I remember the er I think it was like twelve cans of Red Bull
B	and you just wouldn't open the door
A	yeah
B	and you'd be like no me I'm it's great because I got to know you and be like yeah okay just he needs to be left sorry
A	well I'm still that way I'm still like
B	yeah
A	I'm still obsessive but just in different ways now but like erm so for me like after uni it was like having no responsibility and not really worrying too much about you know a degree and once you
B	yeah
A	so I think since I've been teaching I've I've found that like been really struggling because you can't perfect it
B	yeah
A	nothing
B	yeah
A	if you know what I mean and I find that really hard to not perfect something instantly
B	yeah
A	you know I'm just doing my job and I'm going home and my job's my job and I can do it well and then I can go home and I'm not worrying too much
B	yeah
A	about it all the time and I guess that's work
B	I'm sure that's what they call drive isn't it? that ultimately makes you a good teacher and
B	yeah
A	everyone just stopped doing stuff and
B	yeah
B	and I think there's a there's a point there where like like what was I watching the other day? erm that book I wanna get for erm ask my mum for Christmas it's a
A	which one?
B	it's a
A	I think I think I might have seen it
B	it's on Netflix I watched it and the whole time I was just mesmerised the whole time
A	what what Don McCullin's on Netflix?
B	yeah
A	as what like a lecturer or something or
B	no he's he's a
A	is this a documentary?
B	yeah yeah
A	and it's on Netflix?
B	yeah a a photographer and but he never likes to be
A	right
B	this guy is just so I'm gonna use the word but just so cultured and just like it but the great thing is he's even from a really really rough part of London
A	right
B	backing like I think twenties or thirties like thirties maybe
A	and how's your father?
B	he's talking about like you know the place I grew up in
A	yeah
B	into one factory and it's
A	having having a knees up
A	there's something there's something so like like authentic about people like I dunno what it is but it's like it's like people like that I mean who's who
B	no
A	I think it's called A Glass Arena
B	the internet
A	write it down
B	do you know what? I'll go on to my Amazon
B	it's offline and talk about being
A	yeah
B	and I've got an Amazon app but it is useful for that
A	you'll be the death of the high street
A	erm and it's it's I think it's John maybe John Healy or something erm
B	so what's it called? The Glass
A	The Glass or was it The Grass Arena? The Glass or Grass
B	The Glass Castle?
A	no that's it so definitely the something Arena
B	The Grass Arena?
A	I think so
B	oh The Grass Arena by John Healy?
A	John Healy yeah
B	oh it's an autobiography?
A	well more or less but it's about it's about his experiences of being homeless and it was
B	oh wow
A	it I I read it but cos it's on
B	oh I find that now I find I find this now after doing my dissertation imagine doing a little extract from an autobiography
A	should have spoke to me then
B	sorry go on I'll just save that to my wish list
A	erm but in you know what I mean? it's like er you kind of I remember reading it I read like a profile on on John Healy John Healy
B	I'm gonna have to yeah I'm gonna have to check that one out man
A	yeah it's like it's like you were saying there about like about these like these photojournalists and things like that
B	yes
A	there's people who do it you know and because they've been given the chance they've been gifted the chance
B	yeah
A	to do something
B	whereas this was his like it would be like your this was a general passion
A	yeah you know he'd had to he must have had to overcome a lot to to to become you know
B	well is he he said things like as a kid you know like his dad used to let him draw on the kitchen
A	yeah
B	a man of that era allowing his son to do that do you know what I mean?
A	yeah
B	he was like probably working how many?
A	yeah
B	do you know what I mean? it's obviously straight away you're thinking that far to have the talent and then recognise it but
A	yeah
B	yeah no that's it and the whole time I was just mesmerised by this documentary
A	but like
B	it's literally from the sixties he's been in every erm conflict
A	wow
B	erm apart from when er
A	right
B	was it The Times? and Andrew
A	right
B	er and basically he didn't want they didn't want The Times to be like an actual he said you know a like a real paper and cos it used to be like it just you know
A	they wanted it more tabloid and stuff?
B	yeah they wanted the sponsors
A	yeah
B	erm but he he he was really deep because he was talking like
A	yeah
B	he he needed to show the world what was happening he said he couldn't he can't explain it to anyone but and it was just wow
A	and and those those people just people like that and stories like that really
B	yeah
A	it
B	yeah
A	and things like that you think of it as this kind of high trade it's not it's really bland and it's very much like we'll give you this money for this journalist or or the American we'll give you a bit more
B	yeah
A	and they just trade them round
B	mm
A	half the time it's just to make money and they just generate revenue off them
B	yeah
A	and they they go up in price and down in price very very banal I guess you could say erm
B	totally
A	go in to to to really want to show the world that erm to be the person
B	to know that the nine percent chance you are gonna get snatched if you're not working for the BBC or something
A	or shot
B	but then there was that guy wasn't there working for the BBC who got took I can't remember his name
A	it's the need to help people
B	yeah
A	and and and everything was you know everyone said to him like you know the
B	yeah
A	but they can say they have warnings that say
B	yeah
A	we strongly recommend you don't go
B	yeah
A	you know and that's the difference like that that's this is what some people just amazing people and and
B	definitely
A	er you know it's
B	mm
A	they should you know erm you know and and that's the you you learn a lot about yourself cos I honestly think to myself like
B	it makes you look at yourself
A	oh absolutely can
B	no no I
A	you couldn't pay me to well
B	from a if they sell a picture or something yeah
A	yeah pictures and and and things like that and you can make a good bit of money on it but they're salaried they're not
B	no
A	and the
B	mm
A	it's really sad but
B	it it but
A	what compels people?
B	you're totally right the the
A	amazing
B	people that you hear of like that you just think
A	yeah
B	cos they
A	there's erm
B	no I don't
A	yeah
B	mm
A	but sometimes sometimes I wish that like I had a bit more a bit more grit maybe and
B	yeah that's where I was saying before like you were saying like you know this age like your friends like you're saying
A	but you but you will be helping people though
B	yeah and then I think I realise like when we went travelling around Europe I loved it but I realised I was like a home bird
A	yeah
B	that's when I think I realised
A	yeah I'd be the bravest man in the world if there was a clean toilet around
B	except with
A	if I could take one with me
A	if I could have a nice bathroom me I wouldn't mind going anywhere
B	but you know what? halfway through I
B	those er Portakabin if anything I've er
B	if if I didn't smell that mm revolting er chemical smell I was like er I'm not going in there
A	yeah
B	can you remember though going to that hostel in Bratislava and just being like
A	which one?
B	it was where remember the French girls?
A	oh yeah
B	and remember when I kicked off on the middle of the well I didn't kick off but when the French girls were talking to us
A	yeah
B	and then they're saying right oh we're talking English now are we?
A	yeah no like like you understand this
B	yeah yeah
A	yeah
B	and the two of their faces was like that
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	picking up women was like oh that's a healthy attitude
A	they must what's that book called? The Game The Rules of the Game
B	oh yeah yeah
A	I think they all must have read that that was their holiday reading
B	and I was like you're amazing I wanna marry you
A	what's French for marry me?
A	yeah yeah
B	yeah
A	they were they were they
B	yeah well there was the one there was always the one lad who talked to us I think it was the er the Asian lad
A	yeah
B	and then the other two made out as if they couldn't speak English
B	I know erm
B	what is this?
A	confrontation
B	yeah so
A	are you English?
A	yeah
B	yeah so er but no yeah so definitely watch that man that's brilliant that
A	I will
B	Don McCullum
A	one thing one thing it
B	it wasn't in Waterstones I was very surprised it's the
A	I'll know I've seen it
B	from working in Waterstones
A	yeah
B	and it's just a picture of his face and his eyes are like that and he explains for all his pictures but with a
A	yeah
B	a bit of context at the time like the political or whatever conflict and it's just you're just like that
A	yeah
B	yeah so definitely when you've maybe time to yourself
B	yeah
A	yeah I've got to dunno I'm gonna fire off a few well not many jobs I was gonna fire off a couple of job applications this afternoon
A	have you been applying for jobs?
B	well I've not
A	a secret agency
A	yeah
B	erm
A	right
B	that's like
A	so this this is a licence to practise?
B	yeah erm licence to thrill er
B	I've got experience in the adults you see because I've had statutory experience
A	right
B	so at the moment he's gonna find me that but I'm just gonna say it's erm
A	do they come up through NHS?
B	er sometimes
A	cos if you if you're on NHS jobs cos
B	yes
A	I I dread applying for I I dread applying for jobs and then
B	yeah er someone was telling me
A	just the
B	about that yeah
A	because you've got a little pro forma and
B	yeah
A	you half the time you've got applications saved and you just send them off to like
B	yeah
A	and it's it's mad
B	and it's
A	obviously you've gotta tailor them and you can't just be like
A	I've got experience of
A	working in a
B	yeah
A	cinema I know a lot about psychology
A	yeah
B	I quite I dunno I'm quite liking just going and having a book to read or going to the gym and then nothing you know worrying too much about
A	I think I think that I think that's a nice place to be in and I wouldn't I wouldn't go away from that immediately
B	mm
A	cos that's what I feel like now like I feel I've been doing you know I've been in I've been in the same place for three years
B	mm
A	you know and I've got very much you know I'm saying I'm saying I was saying
B	mm
A	like
B	mm
A	so I'm kind of part of me thinks oh god like you know if if can I could I ever like like I just work on my own all the time it's just me
B	yeah
A	sometimes
B	yeah?
A	yeah it's very
B	yeah true
A	have I have I still got my teamworking skills? or will I be just like
A	just a low
B	whilst using your initiative
A	yeah well it's these these these are all good words for my CV
B	it's always
A	yeah
B	and get someone to look over it but really like you know what I mean? but I think the problem for me at the moment I dunno for you but if you are working a a lot of hours like at a certain
A	yeah
B	so
A	that's on Friends they always talk about the fear
B	mm
A	that one with Rachel where like she's the it's like
B	yeah that's it yeah
A	and she quits her job and then she's skint
B	yeah
A	and
B	yeah
A	and that's not a bad thing cos it's a really tough qualification but you you're kind of saying to yourself that er like
B	you've done that now yeah
A	yeah and not only that like I know a lot of managers or language schools and you know a lot of my friends are quite quite you know they're doing er sort of on the border of that kind of job
B	mm
A	really good school and
B	yeah
A	go back to it
B	I think it's good though that you know you're thinking of doing the publishing master's I think it's brilliant
A	yeah I mean it's only obviously that's helped with you know
B	would you do it here?
A	well it's it's like a three grand might be worth
B	oh god yeah yeah
A	might be worth might be worth moving to Edinburgh wouldn't it?
B	definitely will mm
A	cos cos I'm gonna have to pay for it myself so
B	mm
A	I might as well erm
A	we might not be this is the thing is like er I'm really I'm really wary of like talking to people about this stuff cos
B	I know it's
A	cos if it doesn't come good then you're just like a bit of a divvy
B	it's almost like it's a it's it's an idea that you don't quite you
A	it it's like it keeps you sane your little dreams doesn't it?
B	yeah
A	your little visions of how life's gonna be like
B	that's it I mean cos for me the reason I wanna get a job in
A	right
B	and you can go and work in an organisation and stuff like that whereas I kind of feel it would just be pointless me working
A	that's that's what I'm like
B	do you know what I mean?
A	I
B	mm
A	all the time and
B	yeah
A	and and you can do your own stuff but when you're doing the same course
B	mm
A	all the time like you know I've I've taught the same course like about a hundred times
A	and I just feel like if I do it again I'll I'll go mad er because it
B	yeah
A	it's even if you
B	yeah
A	a bit scary I wanna be scared
A	you know what I mean?
B	yeah like an academic thrill ride
A	an emotional roller coaster
A	but I want you know how cos then and if and if I just if but you know if I can't do it then I'll I'll do something else but
B	yeah I mean I think the worst thing is is those that haven't tried isn't it?
A	yeah
B	do you know what I mean? I think as you're talking there is I think
A	yeah
B	don't like to fail not I I I
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	and I don't think erm in the sense where I don't do stuff cos I think I'm gonna fail but cos I know I would like I will trudge and trudge through something to get it I won't have something unfinished
A	yeah yeah
B	erm so I think that's why I needed that but so it's a it's you know it's the thing to have isn't it? you want this sort of I
A	yeah
B	that's self-discipline isn't it? and like going okay it's shit and you know doing this but you get it done and you
A	yeah I
B	mm
A	and I can always delete and edit and that's and that's the wonderful thing typewriters you know like using a typewriter
B	yeah
A	it's like you can
A	you can
A	you know but you can erm you know you can edit and you know redact and things like that and but I still feel nervous when I'm doing it and it's because I'm nervous about like you know getting rejected or
B	I think
A	yeah yeah
B	really you need to have that sort of it's almost like self-confidence certain of us we need to go well no I'm gonna write this and it's
B	and you sat or your whole course just
A	I was
B	and then the man appeared
A	it took me I
B	and then he
A	how how long how long did you how long did did it take you to write like what was your longest stint on an essay?
B	well I wouldn't
A	go on no go on what was the longest time you spent on an essay as an undergraduate? be honest like typing it out?
B	it would be like I I remember I did one cos I
B	I wanted to go and see
A	oh yeah
B	yeah erm
A	oh well
B	I think I did it like in three hours yeah
A	that's the longest time
B	yeah the
A	what was the longest?
B	going off this one see the problem is I don't work on it see I obviously I type it quite quick
A	right
B	but I'll do I'll do my reading and notes beforehand
A	yeah you always did that didn't you?
B	yeah so
A	right
B	my writing's never long but reading notes usually would take me especially the master's I'd do it over like two weeks to a month
A	right
B	so
A	but what I'm saying is when when you were an undergraduate you you had like a similar workload to me but you would you would be very direct you'd be like this has to be finished by this day
B	yeah
A	so and I've I'm doing this and doing this that leaves me four days so I'm gonna finish this in four days
B	yeah that's true yeah
A	whereas what I would do is I'd start my essays like three weeks before the deadline
B	yeah I remember that and then
A	they they'd take me three weeks because I'd sit there and I because I had so much time on my hands
B	you'd delete a copy I remember
A	oh god I'd delete like I used to I
B	I know I I remember your voice you'd be like oh he's done like a thousand words and he's he's just got rid of them
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A would give themselves a lot of time to work on essays.	Entailment
A	I know
B	but that was the difference that was where
A	but but please ask me to email me my
A	but erm and that's the thing so it's like I erm everything was like painstaking with me
B	yeah
A	and that's why I like with with job applications I'm I'm sitting there and I'm I'm writing them out and then I'm like
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B would give themselves a short time to finish their essays.	Entailment
A	what I'm saying is I've I've got a bit better than I was at uni I've learned to be a bit more fearless so I've sent out letters and things like that and then I email people and you know ask about like work experience and stuff and then
A	Macmilla like I hadn't put the L on
A	when you're applying for like
A	a proofreading job
A	like when you're trying to say you're trying sort of sell your proofreading skills to someone and you're like yeah I'm good
B	you should have sent one five minutes later saying ah that was a deliberate ploy so the
A	did you notice my error?
A	erm and and that's the problem is like I kind of got this confidence and I was just like yeah just send it out you're a good writer you can
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A proofread it and got rid of all the errors.	Contradiction
B	yeah
A	you know you've got good grammar you've got good punctuation just send it and then
B	I
A	Macmilla
A	and it wasn't even like embedded in the text so it was like it was the the the title of the email like the subject it was like
B	oh but I know what you mean though
A	embarrassing
[ANNOTATION]	The error was in the body of the email.	Contradiction
B	cos it's not not to that level but I have to email like I email the service manager for the jobs
A	yeah
B	cos it had been ages since I'd applied and I thought ah well if I haven't got an interview I I wanna ask for feedback and
A	yeah
B	but she emailed me back the next day and she was very polite and she said oh thanks very much for your email she's like
A	so you'll hear
B	er hopefully a week Monday I might hear that I've hopefully fingers crossed
[ANNOTATION]	The woman that replied was rude.	Contradiction
A	good luck
B	that got an interview cheers erm
A	why would you write this?
B	exactly but
A	do you normally write dick in emails?
B	not not really but you know these things that
B	anxiety sort of takes over and I'm like
B	I'm like
A	yeah
B	but it was alright though er
A	I have I have I've not not I've not I've never written dick in an email but I've like
B	yeah
A	you will type a sentence and you will go to you might say such as
B	yeah
A	oh no double articles it does pick up but erm
A	just check your writing
B	that's what I mean yeah
A	Macmillas
B	probably thought you were applying for like a I I dunno a brewery or something do you know what I mean?
A	yeah Macmilla
A	it wasn't that bad it was just er the you know they they they have to control the number of applications they get
B	yeah
A	you you have to empathise because
B	I've heard you have to train in Japan for two years
A	yeah in a sense like
A	no it well generally they they want they want erm you can get like certificates from like the society
B	that is not the definitive
A	cos like cos
B	yeah that's right
A	then you know you can't it's not it's not professionalised so they erm
B	well it's good that he emailed you back isn't it? yeah
A	yeah rather than being like Macmilla?
B	douche
A	yeah
B	delete
A	what an idiot so er yeah that was pretty that was pretty bad
B	I suppose it's a less
A	you've gotta you've gotta laugh
B	it's a lesson there for everyone isn't it?
A	I'm I'm trying to think of other parallels and do you watch The Apprentice?
B	no
A	you never watch that? I er I I had never watched it until the other day and I found it hilarious but
B	I've seen the little intros of them like talking about themselves
A	I think they're told I think they're kind of
B	yeah
A	told to be stupid
B	yeah
A	like cos like the guys
B	he tried to sell me an investment deal
A	they're
B	yeah
A	but I think it they're intentionally you know
B	yeah it's like going on Big Brother isn't it?
A	yeah
B	it's one of those
A	they're not gonna pick some bland guy who's just like yeah I just wanna get on with everyone really
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B likes Big Brother.	Neutral
A	it's like they want the guy who's like I'm gonna confront everyone I've got some awful
A	erm and there's there was this really funny bit where they were trying to sell a jumper to erm the buyer like er it was in it was in some fancy London fashion shop probably erm like you know where it's like a hundred quid a a jumper or something? and erm so and it was an awful jumper it was it was called on air and the idea it had a camera in the jumper it was just a terrible idea right and it lit up
A	right and and the guy giving the pitch like the the team leader like giving the pitch to them
A	and the guy's just like what? so I guess that was kind of like an equal faux pas it's like
B	brilliant
A	it's contradicting exactly what your job is
A	to do
B	oh
A	pretty stupid
B	it sounds awful that
A	erm yeah The Apprentice is er yeah
B	there you go there's er
A	er yeah it's it's I don't really like it that much by
B	I think I did to be fair I did watch a bit of the last season but it was more just I think when I was in work sometimes if
A	yeah
B	we'd got a spare like half an hour whatever it was just like yeah
[ANNOTATION]	The jumper Speaker A talks about is checked.	Neutral
A	I don't really like it do you watch much TV?
B	erm yeah I watched that Educating the East End
A	that's really good
B	but do you know what though? it's kind of a thing you
A	did you?
B	but I haven't heard back so
A	where is it? is it being filmed in Liverpool?
B	yeah I made the mistake though didn't I like I should have questioned her and I just like it probably at the most generic do you know what I mean like who do you vote for like blah de blah
A	yeah
B	you know what's your topic of the discussion when I really should have been out there like er I dunno I
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A doesn't like the Educating the East End.	Contradiction
B	party that do that do you know what I mean?
A	what's Animal Farm?
B	it erm there's that book isn't it? er
A	yeah I know about the book
B	yeah I dunno just in my head
[ANNOTATION]	The Animal Farm book has 167 pages.	Neutral
A	do you mean do you mean like come across as like a raving
B	yeah it's like
A	sort of like
B	nutter
A	leftie radical
B	you never know on Wednesday I could get a phone call and said oh someone's pulled out
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A will buy the book.	Neutral
A	it's er it's
B	I think they try and balance
A	right
B	and obviously cos Liverpool's quite staunchly Labour
A	yeah
B	like probably have like and they give you the age bracket so it goes from like twenty-five to thirty-five so
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B used to live in Liverpool.	Neutral
B	do you know what I mean? they have
A	it must be nerve racking though I mean like
B	yeah
A	I don't know I don't I I don't know a lot about
B	I
A	oh yeah
B	and he made you know working for about two pound and hour and then
A	where do they get them?
B	he's renowned he's made comments like that in the past he's an idiot but erm
A	they're gonna jump on it aren't they?
B	but then cos it was in Berkshire obviously it was quite predominantly Tory and they were attacking the Labour woman I can't remember her name going oh you're using this as a a political
A	yeah
B	erm so the so there was things like that
B	and it it's more topical really erm
A	I I used to watch it I used to I used to like it when I was when I used to when I did politics in sixth form I used to watch it
B	yeah used to have
A	did is David Dimbleby still doing it?
B	yeah he's there I mean
A	like a cultural type of
B	yeah you've got
A	bit like
B	like a
A	a writer or
B	or I'll I quite like it when erm the Liberty one was on it I can never pronounce her name
A	er
B	that's it yeah
A	yeah
B	she's very good erm and they had like this reverend guy he's alright but I don't like it sometimes where they're just playing to like the popular sort of thing you'd like to see everything but it's not it's either or it's but it's not really what's gonna
A	I read I read a good
B	mm
A	and there was a show on BBC three and it was like getting young people to talk about issues and stuff like that and it was trying to trying to bridge that gap in politics between you know young disaffected people
B	yeah
A	who who you know want want a voice and things like that and I think it was you know Rick Edwards? I think it was him who hosted it but it was this article you know I mean I don't necessarily agree with a lot of what this guy probably believes you know it's
B	yeah
A	who's who's basically there to take to to to defend to defend themselves and against like vitriol for about you know an hour
B	yeah
A	erm it could would like like cos by a lot of people who don't agree erm
A	it's me cos there was no one in like he was
B	yeah
A	he was as right wing as they came and he was he said he's like you know he's sort of
B	yeah
A	you know but also a lot more what's the word? like staunch in their views and would or will not will not shy away from attacking people
B	yeah
A	he said he looked round the room and was just like
A	oh for god's sake
A	it just really made me laugh cos that's how these shows are made
B	yeah
A	aren't they like it's
A	it's to get get like someone who get someone who can you know sometimes they can just do defend their policies and that's great but it just it really made me laugh that that cos he he must have absolutely bricked it
B	oh god
A	be terrified wouldn't you?
B	I know yeah
A	but erm yeah no
B	yeah I watch that sometimes it's on all the time that
A	yeah it's I think it's on a bit more
B	and This Week is quite good sometimes with
A	was it
B	he used to be The Times editor erm
A	right okay
B	but that's quite good cos they oh Esther McVey was on it the other day oh she does my nut in
A	who's Esther McVey?
B	she's the MP for Greasby and Frankby and she's the minister of I think is she still the minister for disabilities?
A	mm
B	she used to be a weather weather girl erm her dad and family own the flying school in John er John Lennon Airport
A	oh wow
B	running a business basically
A	right
B	you know
A	yeah
B	you know she's come from a you know I'm not saying that anybody comes from a well upbringing hasn't got experience to give to the table but it's not and she just irritates me cos she's just that classic sort of like practiced erm sort of script and it's like erm it was she was defending well she wasn't defending the guy who said that you know but just she's oh it annoys me because at the at the grass roots of it all no matter how they say they're all very like Labour and that and Tories are very similar Tories believe in an organic system where you have your rich and your poor and it's oh well get over the
A	yeah
B	and they say I I hate it when people attack people for being a bit like well why can't we do this with a conscience? oh we can't be pragmatic and have a conscience yes you can most of most of if you look at the Tories most of their policies are reactionary austerity measures that's a reaction well oh oh oh we won't spend anything
A	yeah
B	what about I can never say it
A	Keynesian?
B	that's it if you if you give people money they'll
A	yeah
B	flood the market and the economy because people spending that's gonna like getting the coils going again
A	well if I look at my my education in A Level was
A	I don't know what
A	isn't Keynesian economics trickle-down economics?
B	I think so I think I don't really know but again that's when I'm conscious that I don't have that much
A	yes
B	do you know what I mean?
A	I think you would
B	do you know what I mean? so it's cos if you if you're in something
A	really?
B	yeah that's how it's run
A	in economics
B	that that's it erm
A	but it I think
B	but then if you were or
A	but
B	mm
A	cos how else do you do it?
B	exactly I mean
A	like services
B	social enterprise as kind of people raise sort of racking their brains and thinking of what they can do and you know free services are out there you know government does pay for them mostly
A	yeah
B	via the contract but in the same sense this is what makes me well I guess so annoyed and that's why I was watching it like they'll blame immigration and erm they'll blame er oh it's the it's like they got us into like er this mess and you think yeah but then you're letting the likes are Starbucks and big companies get off with major amount of billions of tax and
A	yeah
B	you're paying how much into the MOD? through all these you know paying how much for a missile? and you know it's
A	yeah
A	I read I read about that it's like
B	it's very clever like
A	isn't it isn't it isn't it proportionately so it's like the tax
B	people
A	the tax break for people are earning the lower bracket is nowhere near as good as the tax break for those
B	yeah
A	who are
B	but it's very cleverly done
A	so so
B	essentially but because
A	and like they're balancing it off
B	cos I mean I'm one of those people now and oh but yeah I've noticed like my
A	yeah
B	but then the way things everyone and oh the cost of living's going up and then you know the way everything is is changing
A	the cost
B	instant don't they? and they go well how much is how much do you wanna spend in Tesco? how much do you spend to like gas and electricity?
A	yeah
B	those are going up you now
A	yeah
B	you know it doesn't compare with er so
A	one thing that saddened me in sort of
B	yeah
A	and I guess I guess the thing is that you can have a you can have a social conscience you know and you try you can you can be someone who who says you know I have a social conscience and things like that
B	yeah true
A	you know and I
B	to essentially yeah
A	I mean we both live in the same geographical area we've got the same qualifications we both
