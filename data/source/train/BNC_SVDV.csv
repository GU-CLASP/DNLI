A	yeah so it's a rainy day for them isn't it?
B	it is indeed a rainy day for
A	yeah
B	well there there always is around here
A	yeah
B	oh yeah
A	if you go and get a mortgage from a bank or something or take a loan out what it's doing is it's not getting that money off someone else it just puts the money in your account from nowhere and what it does is it makes sure that for every pound someone puts into their account it keeps say five percent of that or even as low as one or two percent of that and then it can give off anything else as well
B	so the money isn't transferred?
A	no
B	so is that almost creating money?
A	yeah it is that's how money is created by commercial banks and there's all these models and everything it's really complicated I couldn't really understand it but there's a pyramid where the base of the pyramid is money people have put into their account
B	yeah
A	and the top of the pyramid is money that the banks have created and supposedly the Bank of England can control the amount of money that the banks create by either raising or making smaller the base amount but apparently that's realistically they can't do that
A	yeah by
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah that that's
A	quite a lot goes on yeah
B	it
A	yes yeah
B	it's like somebody who's eating as much as they possibly can
B	in order to eat their own flesh to stay alive
A	yeah
B	and get bigger
B	if they're eating their own flesh
A	yeah yeah well when we were in erm the stockbroker belt as you say
B	oh yeah
A	we went to
B	oh yeah yeah yeah
A	and it's where the stock exchange is based now and there's this man stood on the door this bouncer really checking everybody before they go in to make sure there's no one unauthorised going in or anything
B	yeah
A	so if anyone me or you tried to get in he'd have you out straight away
A	if he's they're employing someone to stand there
B	so that's the actual stock exchanges
A	yeah so only it's not on Thread Needle Street anymore they moved to behind Saint Paul's Cathedral
B	yeah I've heard of
A	yeah
B	that's not often used these days
A	paternoster
B	yeah
B	it is yeah it's enormous
A	yeah
B	you see their trucks coming down here all the time
A	yeah
B	uh do you know? I don't
A	yeah
B	oh yeah that might be a giveaway but I don't
A	but not all of them might we must be near
B	well it's just up there just on your erm yeah just up on your left
A	there's some people who work for Morrisons who live eh well not work for Morrisons sort of own Morrisons or are related to the people who own it live not far from us a couple of miles and there was security in
B	oh
A	apparently it cost them two hundred and fifty thousand pound for half an hour I don't know how true that is
B	er it wouldn't surprise me
A	yeah
B	it wouldn't surprise me at all
A	when you compare that to what we're getting for today
B	uh it's strange isn't it? erm
A	yeah
B	who was?
A	yeah
B	erm
A	that's it
A	oh yeah?
B	erm
A	that's who it is
B	they erm
A	yeah
B	and erm
A	Gary? Gary
B	no
A	Robbie Williams is it?
B	Robbie Williams they got Robbie Williams to play for a private gig erm
A	I think yeah that the
B	I think so I
A	because
B	might might well be there's erm around this area between
A	yeah
B	and all the
A	yeah
B	you know? you're not talking about somebody who
A	especially around here
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	you know? a million pounds is just really
A	yeah
B	same as you or I might spend a tenner
A	yeah
B	really?
A	yeah I don't
B	well knowing yeah yeah it it it could be I
A	yeah so would I
B	cos there's you know? people who live in London
A	yeah
B	pay two hundred million for a new house
A	yeah yeah I know
B	I'd have thought they must be an order of magnitude again on from people around here
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	you know? your
A	there are a few of them who live out in Surrey Hertfordshire Buckinghamshire though as well
B	yeah
A	Kent and Essex
B	maybe that dilutes it
A	yeah
B	yes yes it is
A	as we're
B	want some
A	just leaving north
B	yeah
A	you definitely cross over the river
B	yeah
A	which is in
B	so
A	strictly speaking is its own thing now
B	that's an
A	no no
B	yeah
A	but erm nowadays a lot of those towns have their own individual borough councils their own sort of erm
B	yeah
A	I mean I was when I was doing the work experience at
B	yeah
A	the
B	yeah?
A	what they want is
B	yes
A	they'll then return a mayor that's favourable to whoever's in government in the day yeah
B	yeah yeah
A	yeah
B	it's it's funny isn't it? that
A	yeah
B	get on a plane and go virtually anywhere
A	yeah
B	and you know? you've you've you get this
A	yeah
B	you get an American Airlines thing erm airplane find out you're drinking
B	all those sorts of things
A	yeah
B	but at the same time there's also
A	yeah
B	so Scotland wants independence
A	yeah
B	erm
A	the devolution plan's everywhere yeah
B	yeah
B	UDI for
A	yeah
B	get rid of the rest of them and get on with it
A	yeah
B	erm and there seems to be a sort of a trend that way doesn't there?
A	there is yeah I know Cornwall got given the status from the EU that means its culture and its language need to be officially protected the same to the same extent as Scotland and the other home nations
B	yeah yeah
A	yeah
B	same as Wales I guess
A	yes yeah
B	yes
A	I yeah
B	has it just doesn't have anything
B	it has lots of scenery
A	yeah
B	and coast and and stuff like that but nothing much actually seems to go on there I I don't think there's any industry I presume there's
A	yeah well the
B	is it?
A	yeah it was erm originally some kind of industrial site and then it was renovated into the
B	into the
A	the
A	and erm I was surprised when I was at north
B	did they?
A	a a morning wouldn't go by and an afternoon wouldn't go by with something referring to it
B	ah I see yeah yeah
A	yeah and then they're saying about do you remember when we did such and such for the Tour de France and everything? and do you remember this? do you remember that? Tour de France Tour de France clearly it was a big thing for the region
B	yeah oh it was it was huge
A	it was huge wasn't it? yeah
B	absolutely huge
A	Bristol Street Motors I saw there I've heard of them from somewhere
B	yeah
A	is it? oh right okay
B	a national brand is Bristol Street Motors
A	do they only ever go on a street called Bristol Street?
B	no
A	cos that might be quite hard to come by here I was thinking
B	it would wouldn't it? yeah I wonder if there is a Bristol Street in
A	I wonder where the nearest Bristol Street is?
B	might be in
A	yeah probably in Bath or somewhere
B	have you been to Bristol ever?
A	funny you should say that
B	mm
A	someone raised the suggestion going to Bristol cos I know with the cross country trains from
B	can you?
A	yeah
B	I've never I've always driven down to it and
A	yeah
B	my daughter used to live there and
A	I've always wanted to go
B	yeah it's nice
A	yeah
B	and erm while he was there we walked it er a couple of times you know? down the city centre and roundabout
A	yeah
B	and er yeah it's quite a groovy city is erm
A	yeah?
B	a lot of creative people
A	yeah
B	who don't want to live in London
A	I see yeah cos it's the second biggest city in the south for population
B	live in live in Bristol yeah
A	yeah
B	that sort of culture
A	mm yeah
B	around erm around Bristol you know? people who've you know? sort of found it more congenial than than London less expensive to live et cetera
A	I see yeah
B	and there's Mr Brunel's suspension bridge of course which is worth a
A	yes of course yeah
B	yeah worth a a look at any day of the week is that
A	the
B	going along here we've passed
B	yeah which I I just think it's a lovely name
B	no
B	very little
A	is it like a little village or something?
B	yeah yeah it is erm
A	post office well it's better than
B	yeah yeah
A	yeah
B	no it's a shame isn't it?
A	is that strange as far as villages go?
A	yeah
B	and that has a little village shop
A	yeah
B	why is that I wonder?
A	they've all they've the mentality is definitely wouldn't want to be in in the village it would be drive out to
B	yeah
A	erm it's very much a village of two halves soon as you pass the pub it's in into the east end
B	I wonder why
A	definitely the people in the west end where we er you know other way round rather the people in the east end where we are would definitely say that you'd rather live there than in in the other side
B	so is the other side is the side nearer the
A	yes yeah
B	between the pub and the
A	yeah yeah
B	right
A	I mean there's no difference at all really but they think they're a cut above where we are and with it being long and not sort of spread out as wide it's quite linear
B	yeah yeah
A	that creates quite an introverted almost not wanting to
B	yeah it's funny isn't it? yeah
A	go out which is why a shop maybe or a community thing wouldn't be the best thing only the a few of us from the village go to the domino drives whereas all the other three villages draw a a big local following
B	do they?
A	yeah especially
A	yeah
A	yeah
A	yeah yeah
B	if it's more compact
A	yeah
B	no
A	yes
B	that one of the bloke in his overalls in the bonnet of the car
A	yeah the mechanics yeah
B	yeah that's extremely
A	yeah
B	look of it as you drive up the village
B	yeah is it? is it an actual competition?
A	yeah they
B	yeah
A	it's an easy way for the village society to make a bit of cash
B	yeah
B	oh right
A	and even that's quite divisive there's definitely some people who say
A	definitely know do you know what I mean?
A	we used to have
B	yeah
A	a disco sometimes
B	yeah well
A	yeah
B	loads of villages have a little do I mean there's one at
A	yeah
B	where we work and
A	yeah
B	fuddle
A	well the
B	is it?
A	it's a huge event yeah and they have some on the ceremonious lord mayor of
B	really?
A	yeah all these little traditions that date back hundreds of years
B	but
A	it has yeah
B	ah yeah yeah
A	I've played cricket there before
B	ah that's
A	it's a really nice pitch actually
B	yeah I believe it is
A	in
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	and we did a gig at that very school a few weeks ago
A	ah yeah
B	she wasn't there it was a new headmistress cos she's retired
A	no
B	that was good it was good
A	what was the gig like? what? what sort of event was it?
B	erm it was a fundraiser it was a school fundraiser erm
A	yeah
B	think a
A	yeah
B	you can tell by the cars and the way they dress
A	haha yeah
B	it was great it was very enjoyable
A	yeah
B	just up there you I don't think you'll be able to see it is
A	oh yeah
B	much favoured by climbers
A	yeah because you do climbing don't you? you two?
B	yeah yeah we do
A	I've never had a great head for heights personally or
B	you've never what?
A	I've never had a great head for heights I've never
B	yeah it's erm
B	I've
[ANNOTATION]	If the other person was afraid of heights or not.	Neutral
A	yeah
B	but I came to like it erm
A	yeah
B	I mean we we'd we've climbed woods this year and we might get another one in with a bit of luck
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	The other person climbed woods during the year.	Entailment
B	erm
A	yeah
B	go out with him but it is it is erm there's a definite sense of achievement
A	yeah I can imagine
B	of of getting to the top there's a fair bit of technique involved in it
A	yeah
B	and erm
A	one thing I would like to do is to go canoeing
B	and and I'm not so bothered for canoeing
A	I'd love it
B	oh right
A	although the kayaking I'm not so fond of that's where you're sort of hemmed in and you've got one paddle with two things on the end
[ANNOTATION]	There isn't a sense of achievement if you go with him.	Contradiction
B	yeah
A	yeah it's open Canadian
B	yeah
A	but you can go on lakes rivers streams just seems to be something that would be quite fun canals
[ANNOTATION]	It wouldn't be fun to go on the lakes and rivers.	Contradiction
B	yeah played there a few times
B	I've done a few gigs there
A	yeah
A	I see yeah
B	and they tend to be the people who organise them so
A	ah yeah
B	the people who organised that one at
[ANNOTATION]	They could be the people that are organized.	Neutral
A	yeah
B	erm
A	oh wow yeah
B	and we do loads of business with them and
A	yeah
B	so when it comes they're organising the gig
A	yeah
B	erm and what did they call her? and his wife
[ANNOTATION]	If they have loads of business with them.	Neutral
A	yeah
B	cos they're just erm
A	yeah
B	you know? just farming community
A	yeah
B	because he's a farmer as well
A	yeah?
B	erm anybody anybody who has a farm
A	yeah cos you've done young farmers haven't you?
B	pardon?
A	you've done young farmers thing
B	yeah we do the young farmers we've done lots of young farmers ones
A	they know how to party don't they?
B	oh they do certainly know how to party
A	there's a lot of people well erm not a lot of people but there's a one or two people at our school who are involved with that and they always seem to have things going on
B	yeah
A	and
B	do they yeah?
A	yeah
B	well there's some you know? they they vary erm
A	yes
B	you know in nice hotels
A	yeah
B	in
B	erm
A	yeah
B	erm and then others er the village hall type one where they all turn up with the straw still in their hair and just get
B	well lubricated slam down a load of grub then dance their socks off all night while getting steadily drunker
A	yeah
B	yeah yeah like the slow tunes
A	and then that
B	yeah
A	and then for the ceremony which according to this lasts forty-five minutes we're pretty much silent we just have to enjoy that
B	yeah
A	and they're already married
B	yes they are yeah they married in the registry office
A	and then two fifteen until about half three
B	of course yeah
A	the one
B	right
A	but not for folk to be dancing to unless they want to and that's all on the top floor then where they're not having the ceilidh for safety reasons and we'll have to work out whether we want to be
A	mm
B	yes
A	yeah
B	yeah that's their first dance isn't it? the Take That thing
A	yeah
B	and then
A	so is this
B	it is this we are passing through

B	so what is there up here? I used to work about a mile down there at
A	oh yeah
B	erm it has its own microclimate up here
A	really?
B	it can be it can be like this up here and two or three miles away it can be sunny
A	gosh
B	it's a very erm it's a strange place to build an airport
B	because there's a bloody great hill called
B	and if you you know? if you're talking about the thirties if you're staggering into the air in some er overladen old biplane the last thing you want is a bloody great hill right in front of you
A	yeah
B	and there's well the same applies now really
A	I can't I can't see any aircraft at all
B	erm
A	oh yeah
B	over there
A	we went to the
B	oh yes you did didn't you?
A	and there isn't a second where you can't look up and not see anything
A	yeah one goes through and by the time you can still see it the next one's coming through
B	yeah yeah oh it's it's barmy for it isn't it?
A	yeah
B	I'll show you
A	is it the the greenish one? yeah
B	the greenish building well
A	yeah
B	it extends I don't know if you can see it very well it extends all the way
A	oh yeah is it?
B	can you see just glimpses of it?
A	yeah
B	yeah? well they used to make airplanes there during the war
A	did they?
B	mm
A	gosh
B	and it was camouflaged the camouflaged scheme was designed by some really famous
A	yeah
B	and there that that's the end of it
A	gosh still
B	and it even had artificial sheep grazing on the roof it was made to look like the surrounding fields
A	it didn't oh goodness me
B	yeah
B	oh turfrights? is it?
A	no it it wasn't that it was something along that yeah the
B	oh
A	something along the lines of it and it claimed to help your grass grow but it was in effect
B	airplane up there yeah
A	green spray paint
B	oh really?
A	yeah that they sprayed on the grass to make it look green and that's
B	oh definitely
A	I tried to google the name of the company to see if they're still in operation but I couldn't find anything
A	yeah oh here we are Monarch
B	that's it that's the airport
A	oh gosh yeah there's erm a Ryanair flying down the runway
B	yeah yeah in fact just taking off isn't it?
A	yeah
B	yeah it was never discovered never
A	yeah
B	they knew it was around here somewhere but they never succeeded in locating it
A	yeah
B	oh yes
A	and then dark in a city so then there were these massive holes which were bomb craters that were now filled with water they were like ponds
B	ah
A	that was erm somewhere in the
B	yeah yeah
A	these series of big
B	yeah yeah
A	if you dip your toe you just end up
B	that's right yeah yeah
A	with a little smiley face if you're doing well
B	yeah very good very good those signs I think erm I think if we come down here
A	yeah

A	it's a Farmfoods now
B	yeah it is
A	great food at amazing prices apparently
B	we'll believe them
B	yeah
