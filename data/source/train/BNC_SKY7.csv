A	I'm alright when I'm not working on a Tuesday afternoon but I probably will start to be working on a Monday and a Tuesday all the time
C	mm
A	cos we can always go scooting anyway afterwards
C	so so good
A	so good? what do you think you're gonna do at circus tomorrow?
C	hopefully juggling
A	yeah well I was gonna say you can definitely always practise juggling at home cos I think you've got really the the talent for it so
C	we learned bounce
A	that was the first time you went recently wasn't it? the bounce juggling mm cos we er I do want to go to the juggling weekend place in
C	when you said
A	no it didn't
B	are we allowed some crisps? are we allowed some crisps?

B	and ham
A	oh and ham brilliant
A	all the all the key food groups are covered then aren't they?
C	yeah
A	fat protein
A	carbohydrate sugar
A	salt that's it
C	doughnut
A	that's it
A	that's all you've got
B	chocolate
A	so it'd be nice if you had some vitamins and minerals in there
B	we already had some vitamins
A	when?
B	at lunch
A	yeah you had a vitamin tablet you didn't have an actual set of nice fresh
A	vegetables that would give you all the good things
C	wait I'm just gonna do something
A	the word
A	as in south people and
C	oh
A	so
C	mm doughnut
A	there isn't any er east folk or west folk it's just north and south
C	awkward silence
B	mm

C	there was for a few seconds
A	oh I keep forgetting to get proper blue Blu-Tack
C	did you say Peppa Pig blue Blu-Tack?

A	uhu? oh it's a shame you guys are gonna be with dad when I go off to my Alice in Wonderland party
A	but then you'll see
A	I said flipping
A	oh my goodness
C	what?
A	I'm not gonna play that song to you any more
A	I can your little eyes light up as soon as it turns on

C	yeah just play it to us
A	er no
C	right right now
A	no
B	what about the F word?
A	yes there is there must be an er er you can probably get I'm sure a version of it that is not explicit that is not using the F word
B	mm
B	mm
A	and er yes and I'm I'm doing hoop tomorrow
A	and then I'm doing hoop on Monday
B	mm
A	and I'm going to aim so that I'm doing two Thursdays of teaching and then I'm gonna do four more hoop sessions but they are late aren't they? they're too late so you will have to have a babysitter for that now you know where you went once to the special pole dancing place where I do the hoop on a Monday?
C	yes
A	if I can get the people that own it to agree are you alright with coming to that and just sitting there with the tablet and books and stuff like that?
C	mm
A	cos that's an earlier slot
C	doughnut
A	yes or no?
A	because that one you could go to on a Monday evening
C	mm probably a bit too tired
A	no you won't because it's seven to eight thirty so whenever I come back from that you are still awake
C	I'll still be tired
A	you'll still be tired except you won't be because whenever I come home you're always awake
A	and pay for the babysitter
C	okay
A	to do both but I can't let you come to the Thursday one annoyingly cos even though there's really cool circus stuff to play with
C	mm guess so
A	so I will have to get a babysitter for the Thursday but I don't really want to have to get one for the Monday as well
C	okay
A	okay?
B	we'll go for we'll go for the Monday
A	okay thank you well I'll have to check to see if it's okay as well

unknown	half
A	half yeah
unknown	jinx
A	quintuple jinx yeah
C	quintuple jinx
A	I just think you need to stop at triple jinx then you need to say done something like that together
C	yeah but when we say
B	done bum
C	what if we say done? then we'll have to jinx each other
A	no you won't have to jinx each other where is this obsession with jinxing come from?
A	that's er quite a recent thing isn't it?
C	I dunno
C	jinxing?
B	we started it
C	no I was six
A	no that's nonsense not like that
A	jinx double jinx triple jinx no you haven't been doing that

C	I want to do it
A	well that's what I was gonna say
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	but you will get absolutely covered in mud

A	will you get a
C	wait do the children also have to do rope climbing?
A	no they do er I don't know what they will have but they'll have a much easier nicer fun one for the kids but I guess you'll probably get I don't know a medal or something or a certificate or something like that but if we all go I mean I'll well I'll be quite tired because we'll be coming back from
C	so is there
A	it's just fun it's just fun oh for the grown-ups you mean?
C	for the children
A	for the children it's just fun
C	for the grown-ups?
A	erm it is still just fun but you are timed so you know how fast or slow you are whereas the other one that I'm gonna do in the summer Insane Terrain I'm not getting timed for that
A	and there will be fifteen obstacles
A	one is a big kind of muddy lake that you have to swim through then you have to climb up a rope then you have to go over a massive wall then you have to run through fire
C	run through it? or run over it?
A	run well run over it leap over it
A	so I hope there's a bit in the corner that you don't have to jump very high cos I can't jump at all erm
A	and and other things that I don't know about probably crawl under some barbed wire that sort of thing
B	a giant pit of creepy crawlies
