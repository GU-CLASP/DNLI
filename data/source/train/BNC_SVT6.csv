B	er hello
A	hello right so after the BMW and we're off
B	oh
A	whoever's transcribing this is probably gonna be oh no they're driving again
A	sorry there we are let's get you organised
A	shouldn't fall over there
A	okay
B	is talking about the manoeuvres and the driving that you're doing
B	cos is is it? er I suppose it is
A	yeah
B	mm telling someone off is that a conversation?
B	they have to respond
A	what constitutes a conversation?
B	I dunno
A	as in above and beyond communication I don't know so
B	well there's something for everybody to think about
A	well indeed okay right we need to get to that
B	er
A	nice stage where we forget that there's the recorder thing there
B	yeah I know
A	babble on
B	just don't think I've got anything left to say
B	I've said it all
A	no you haven't
B	no I haven't
A	you've been quite quiet this past few days and that's fair enough cos you can be however you want to be
B	no I have been quite quiet
A	yeah
A	it's good
B	so I just
B	oh did we get the hummus out of the fridge? probably not
A	yes
B	oh did you?
A	yeah
B	well
A	and I switched on the fridge in the van and it's in there
B	oh good for you
A	hooray so yeah I think I hope we remembered any everything
B	yeah
A	the only thing I can't locate in my mind is my new black woolly hat but I think that was in the hood of my coat when we left
B	mm
A	and I don't remember moving it so I think as I stuffed the coat in the
B	it's probably still there
A	van
B	uhu
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	erm
A	I can't believe that that's erm I have to check out my local
B	oh it's crap
A	I know
A	yeah erm
B	or out of a jar in Tesco they sell it in jars
A	yeah
B	I just think oh no
A	I know with a sell by date of like twenty-one thirty-nine
B	mm
A	erm with the foil lid that you're meant to peel off but
B	yeah
A	you can only peel off if you have the thumbs of an Olympian cos they're so tight erm
B	mm yeah I've seen that one
B	but that stuff last night is actually hummus
A	I know
A	well as we understand it
B	as we understand it
A	as opposed to as Polish people understand it
B	which means that I don't have to start making it and which means that I don't have to buy a blendy thing
A	yeah
B	in order to make hummus cos I don't think it would work for the stick blender
A	no and more importantly it means you don't have to clean
B	I don't have to clean said
B	oh look a ski slope
A	it is yeah
A	yeah mini slope that's quite sweet
B	mini slope
A	there is yeah
B	could do that today
A	yeah well on the way into town like I say I need to get some things from the shops so if you want to
B	yeah
A	do a bit of shopping with me or if you want dropping off somewhere or whatever then yeah
B	yeah
A	I've got time I've got a student at six but nothing before so
B	okay well we'll see whichever supermarket is you think you would most like to go to
A	oh my god look in the mirror behind you
B	oh it's beautiful
A	oh we didn't get that view on the way here
B	we didn't
A	jeez oh wow look at the mountains in the sunshine
A	oh my god
B	don't crash don't crash don't crash
A	yeah
B	ah
A	might be a bit freaky for people I'm just wondering if I can pull over somewhere and just I don't know get out and look at it without crashing the van
A	it is beautiful but no we're coming down the hill now so we're probably gonna lose them in a bit
B	mm
A	but on the plus side we're on the road with buzzards
B	we are on the road with buzzards
A	yeah
B	so it's not a loss
A	no our mountain loss is our buzzard gain so keep an eye out for that yeah that's just beautiful oh I'm gonna have to come this way more I think
B	yeah for sure
A	but then when I'm living with the hippies they're just up the road so
B	I know yeah
A	I'm gonna have that view every morning for the rest of the summer well spring summer and autumn
B	that's nice
A	all being well so
B	yeah
A	yeah gorgeous
A	mm
B	it takes a bit of time to sort of erm get back into alignment I guess
A	yeah
B	so I guess I've got a few days of sorting everything out sorting myself out
A	mm
B	feeling positive
A	hooray
B	hallelujah after
A	I wonder if your definitions of
B	Sunday
A	on track may have evolved and shifted in the last week or two anyway
B	for sure yeah
A	mm
B	and now that I know
B	erm I feel a little bit like I can go forward knowing
A	mm
B	you know that this is the right path er and not a er
A	not a blind alley?
B	not a blind no not a blind alley but erm
A	or a dead end
B	you know er it's I've got I'm going it alone not alone alone
B	but I'm going it alone
A	yeah
B	erm so yes so when to ski skis boots and poles for only twenty
A	wow
B	you were had
A	well I did have a
B	for? and it was how much? forty? or thirty?
A	it was
B	forty-five
A	yeah
A	but I thought about that and I thought I think that's more than double what we were paying in
B	it was
A	er and it was more
B	no
A	expensive than
A	was it?
B	or forty I can't remember
A	I thought it was much less than that I've got three pound fifty in my head
B	no
A	no?
B	I think it was thirty
A	mm okay
B	erm and in
A	mm
A	yeah
B	erm
A	I I knew it'd be more here because it's really touristy
[ANNOTATION]	They are in a tourist spot	Entailment
B	how much was erm how much was the the ski pass?
A	ski pass? er it was four hours for seventy
B	oh
A	so what's that? twelve quid I know
A	oh
B	and well yeah but it does seem expensive doesn't it?
B	right so
A	yeah
B	so I'll just get
A	I thought and I don't know how you feel about this fifty
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	speaker A ski pass costs seventy dollars for four hours	Contradiction
A	so maybe we can get her a bottle of that between us?
B	mm
A	if you're up for that?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah I was thinking what I could get her I don't know
A	I thought about getting her a bottle at Christmas and then I thought that'd be a little bit over the top
B	uhu
A	seeing as I got you guys like a key ring and a gingerbread man and
B	well yeah you know that's what I was saying the other day about buying that bottle of gin for
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	speaker B has bought a bottle of gin	Neutral
B	like
B	er
A	yeah
B	flap flap flap flap flap
A	cor
B	not going anywhere
A	I would have a guess at sparrowhawk
[ANNOTATION]	speaker A has bought a key ring and a gingerbread man	Entailment
B	flapping hard
A	oh
B	mm
A	good
A	yeah
B	I might go into
A	yeah
B	but that's it
A	fair enough
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	speaker A four hours ski pass for twelve quid is expensive	Entailment
A	so I won't stalk you too much
B	no
A	being respectful of my you as my friend but if you wanna grab a coffee or
B	yeah
A	go to the pictures or
[ANNOTATION]	speaker B and speaker A are going skiing	Neutral
B	yeah
A	go to
A	you know you just wanna
B	I'm not stalking you but would you like to come
A	yeah
A	exactly
B	five hundred miles away?
A	and also what I erm often do as you may have noticed is in our group WhatsApp group I'll quite often say going into town this afternoon if anyone
B	yeah
A	wants to meet for lunch or a coffee
B	mm
A	and then if you do just get in touch and if you don't don't bother
B	yeah
A	that's not a problem
A	oh shit there's only me and you in town
B	yeah
A	oh it's a bit pointless me posting group messages then right
B	uhu
A	do you want coffee or lunch? or whatever but if you don't then it's not a bother
B	aye
A	yeah
B	I probably will
A	yeah
B	mm
A	and get some air and I think for me it's all the more important when the weather's shit or
B	oh yeah absolutely
A	when it's like
B	if you erm
A	minus fifteen and you don't wanna go anywhere
B	I mean I'm all for hibernating but if you're hibernating for days on end it's really bad for you
A	yeah
B	even if you've just gotta really drag yourself to go to Tesco to buy a loaf of bread
A	mm
B	you've gotta do it
A	yeah
B	and when I lived in
A	yeah yeah
B	erm but I know it's really easy to not to not do it
A	yeah
B	at the same time and I think that's what
A	mm
B	just doesn't go out but we're supposed to see him on Saturday
A	oh yeah oh now did I say? Saturday I'm off to see
B	yeah so Sunday let's say
B	mm
A	an alarm reminder on my phone and
B	yeah
A	I was talking with a hippie friend about this it does seem that when you practise living in your now moment
B	uhu
A	what somebody told you in some other now moment
A	don't set oh my god beautiful mountains if I don't oh that's a bus stop so I won't stop there jeez that's stunning
B	mm
A	oh
B	that's really beautiful isn't it?
A	isn't it? oh wow it's a shame it was so cloudy and
B	yeah I know yesterday
[ANNOTATION]	it will be sunny tomorrow	Neutral
A	it was snowy and sleety when we were on our way here
B	mm yeah the scale of it's huge
A	immense isn't it?
B	yeah nice
A	wow yeah
B	god it's nice
A	woah look at that bus
A	what does
A	yeah
A	it sounds a bit Northern Irish
A	yeah
B	yeah and er I don't know what
A	yeah
B	not to paint
B	no I don't no I don't mean horizontal I just mean he's er inactive
A	yeah
B	yeah and if he's hoovered I will
[ANNOTATION]	it is summertime	Contradiction
A	it'll be a miracle
[ANNOTATION]	he is very active	Contradiction
B	it I will
A	yeah
B	I don't know what I will do I don't know
A	I kinda get the
B	I think so
A	and
B	yeah
A	he doesn't really think about doing anything himself because he never has I dunno
B	mm I think there's lots of truth in that he's a
B	erm I agree in some ways and there's some sort of characteristics that he has you know you know when erm you're talking to someone and erm they're just not listening
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	he listens attentively sometimes	Neutral
B	er and they go oh really? oh uhu and we all do it
A	yeah
B	it's human nature that you've got your own mind whirring and whirring
A	you're phased out at something yeah
B	erm but it's you know
B	I was like oh my god why?
A	ah whereas you could imagine
B	yeah exactly erm and maybe people have different ways of articulating or whether people erm
A	oops just jumped a red light excuse me ah
[ANNOTATION]	everyone pays attention to one another	Contradiction
B	erm people have different ways of articulating or people are what?
B	I just don't know what could've happened in
A	oh
B	er whereas I took
A	oh yes
B	and he raved about it like it was the best thing
[ANNOTATION]	everyone articulates the same way	Contradiction
A	yeah
B	he'd ever done I was like we'd literally just walked up a hill
B	er and
A	no
B	cos he'd be like oh it's just a hill
B	so
A	that's funny
B	yeah so how people interpret things or at least talk about it afterwards is
A	yeah all very different yeah
B	really different yeah
B	he just fucking loved that hill he would go like every day on his own
A	I know yeah
B	and when loads of people came over
B	he just went on his own
A	yeah
A	he is
B	but I'm gonna start going for more walks like that erm when it does get a bit nicer
A	yeah I recommend it
B	yeah
A	another thing is get on the bus for twenty minutes and then
B	walk home yeah
A	yeah
B	erm
A	I've got a vague idea I think the you know the buses are pretty good you know
B	mm
B	mm
A	and there are loads of buses with that on the front erm what else is there?
B	uhu
A	that's sort of up the same way but a bit further
B	mm
A	nearer towards the entrance for the motorway erm yeah you can get a vague idea from the front of the bus the likely direction that it's gonna take
B	mm
A	and I quite enjoyed that and I did that the other day and I got the bus into town and I just got off at a different stop and walked some roads that I've never walked before
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yep so I'm just gonna try try and do that
A	don't try do
B	do well yeah exactly
A	yeah
B	so I'm doing loads of cardio in the gym but I just think why? I'm just sort of you know climbing my stairs to nowhere or
A	mm
B	you know I don't go on the treadmills but you know cycling and I just could be doing that outside
A	yeah
B	but not yet
B	yeah exactly
A	you can't beat fresh air even if it is big minus numbers obviously if it's big minus numbers you need to
B	yeah
A	protect your chest and be careful but
B	and I can't run outside when it's icy or there's any possible chance of falling over
A	yeah
B	I don't know how people do it I just don't know
A	I really don't who was? there was somebody talking the other day saying I'm gonna go for a run was that
B	uhu yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	had trouble standing like being vertical and then she was going for a run
B	yeah just
A	mental
B	people have told me that they prefer running in snow and ice and I don't know whether it's sort of because you're running on snow it's more sort of padded or er I don't know or whether
A	yeah
B	it makes you concentrate more because you've gotta be careful I dunno
A	no that's gonna be even worse because you'd be tensing the muscles so
B	yeah
A	you won't be responding quickly enough
B	I just don't know
A	yeah I think that with
B	mm mm mm
A	these guys that wear the
B	yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	the finger shoes
B	yeah and the tiny shorts and thin legs
A	erm and yeah tiny shorts and skinny legs
B	wirey
A	and er you know I'm kind of navigating my way up a north face that's a little bit slippery and they're in their wafer thin
B	mm
A	barefoot running finger sock things doing like ten miles an hour or something
B	like gazelles yeah
A	they are leaping like gay gazelles so yeah I don't know how they manage that and you know I can nearly turn an ankle slipping on a rock or slipping on a bit of ice
A	and they're just I dunno and you see them as they run
A	and watch them and watch you know the placement of their feet
B	mm mm mm
A	and think how do you know that rock isn't loose?
B	yeah
A	how do you know?
B	I think practice when I used to ride er bikes a lot
A	mm
B	er and I was you can just sort of read read the land
A	yeah I mean I know I I do get that instinct when I walk in the mountains a lot
B	mm
A	of which rock is definitely wobbly but you can never know with a hundred percent certainty that
B	yeah
A	you're not gonna like wobble off fall off
B	mm
A	so yeah
A	sounds like it's something B O I think is what they normally call organic
B	organic somethings
A	regeneration of something or other
B	oh
A	oh look look at the mountains
B	oh it's nice wow
A	wow
B	yeah if it'd been clear we'd we just never knew did we?
A	no not a clue the first I knew was skiing yesterday being right up at the top after we'd
B	uhu
A	been up a few stair lifts and stair lifts
B	mm
A	and revealed themselves beautiful
B	nice house all alone
A	cold house
B	house
A	mm
B	it's alright ain't it?
A	yeah
B	oh would you like er an
A	oh
B	er made out of made out of
A	mm
B	mm
A	no
B	mm
A	erm
B	oh good
A	I've done one of my metal box things and I'm on photos and cards and letters now
B	are you are you
A	right
B	and taking the things that I don't wanna wear and just putting them in a bag and hiding them in a different cupboard
A	er no I'm really am
B	really really
A	yeah
B	uhu
A	to the point that I feel
B	yeah
A	yeah oh I wish I'd kept this I wish I'd kept that but what makes it all okay is erm
B	uhu
A	and I haven't found the like in Poland I bought some cheap shit out of Ikea which has sufficed
B	uhu
A	and then I haven't had any salads cos it's been too bloody cold so you know
B	yeah
A	I have regret that that salad bowl is no longer in my life but erm it's okay I can live without it
B	yeah I was this was on Woman's Hour last week er and it was someone who'd written a book on stuffocation where you are suffocated by stuff that you have in your life that you don't need
A	it's not me
B	erm er and the a woman who sort of lives only on the bare essentials
A	oh no that's not me either
B	or has you know only the bare essentials
A	yeah
B	erm and you know she was going through her kitchen and she was like do I really need a vegetable peeler?
A	yes
B	or can I survive without it?
A	no
B	and she gave her potato peeler away
A	no
B	because she just thought well you know if you erm
A	one knife does it all?
B	one knife does it all
A	yeah
B	and eat the peel
A	well
B	peeling a
A	it's the worst if it's non-organic
B	uhu erm
A	yeah most of the chemicals from potatoes and apples are in their skin so if they're non-organic you gotta get rid of that shit
B	mm erm
A	yeah
B	but he was saying you know it's not saying that you're not allowed to have anything you've just gotta be sort of
A	allowed?
B	be careful
A	sounds like giving your power to somebody else
B	mm er and the
B	a snowboard and the jackets and da da da da da da da? and he was like well you know if you want them have them but
A	mm
B	I was like I don't understand what the point is of this you know this woman's saying have nothing
A	no
B	he's saying have whatever you want within reason at which I can't you know explain I just think oh
A	I don't think there is any reason
A	I think if you want it have it
B	yeah
A	it's you know
B	but where do you draw the line at what's
A	that's a completely
B	what's necessary?
A	personal issue
B	uhu and I think the best way was this Japanese woman who said er does it spark joy?
A	yeah
B	to a potato peeler do you spark joy? I'd be like no
A	mine does because
A	my potato peeler's shaped like a little man
B	oh that's nice
A	it's brilliant
B	yeah
A	and you sort of hold onto his body and his arms are holding the peeler blade which is razor sharp
B	oh nice
A	so yes my
B	yeah
A	well
B	mm
A	erm and he's sort of upheld arms were clasping the pizza cutter
B	oh nice
A	it was quality but I did get rid of that when I left Northern Ireland because I didn't eat pizza
B	mm
A	so
B	mm
A	if I haven't touched it in a year it's gone I don't need it I've never understood the concept of for example underbed storage
B	mm
A	to store things under your bed you have too much shit erm or I have too much shit cos again it's a personal thing but yeah moving a three-bed house into a camper van that was a real challenge and it was most definitely connected with letting go on an emotional level
B	mm
A	and I think the boxes that I'm doing now these two metal containers I've done one of them and I basically wanna turn two metal boxes into one
B	uhu
A	erm and they're just like little boxes with a little carry handle I think they're designed for file storage originally
B	mm
A	what the fuck are you doing on my side of the road? thank you erm
A	there's another car on my side of the road this one's just coming right at me I think I'm just gonna have to brake now
B	Jesus
A	fuck's sake
B	in the passenger seat
A	maybe she's having a heart attack and he's taking her to hospital?
B	I think she was just frightened
A	she probably was yeah are you a bit chilly? mind a bit of heating?
B	no whatever
A	I'll pop a bit on if you get too hot just say erm let's pop that round there that on there
A	and mind the bend in the road
A	yeah so
B	it's a nice blue sky
A	now what I'm intending to do is I had a camper van full of stuff for the journey from Northern Ireland to Poland erm
B	mm
A	not that I've asked him still but I will in February and then when I return I want just enough stuff to live in the camper van
B	mm
A	so I know from having lived in it for like a month touring Ireland for example I've you know got a good idea of kitchen utensils and
B	mm
A	things like that
B	so will you be living in your house in April?
A	no I've got a tenant in er with
A	oh god sorry
B	yeah yeah yeah
B	I know it's frightening isn't it?
A	it's kind of a little bit off-putting but anyway that one pulled in a bit more efficiently than the last two
B	yeah so er
B	mm
A	and then after that I'll be disappearing
B	but the house will be empty
A	yeah do you wanna move in to it?
B	no
A	oh
B	no not at all I er was just sort of curious
A	erm no I'll be moving end of February
B	everything everything?
B	mm
A	to be a farmer
A	yeah
B	mm
A	erm and it really is down to the emotional stuff now I think I'm probably gonna keep erm a lot of that but then I look at like you know congratulations on your wedding cards and I'll maybe keep one or two of those but
B	yeah it is really difficult with things like that uhu
A	you don't need fifty or whatever erm yeah
B	I've got you know Valentine's cards that I got when I was fifteen
A	oh Jesus
B	or fourteen but you know they were nice and you know some poor boy had gone to the trouble of writing a poem
A	ah
B	and I just think I can't throw that away at some point in my life somebody liked me enough to write a poem about me put it in a card and post it to my house and you know
A	that's very sweet
A	course it will
B	no so you know
A	ah
B	things like that and it seems a bit stupid to keep something that's so
A	mm
B	fuck it I'm keeping it
A	fair enough
B	yes
A	yeah
B	just things like that
A	so if that's like if you're considering an a clear out like I say from my experience has been that clearing stuff is like clearing emotionally so what
B	uhu
A	emotion if you want to phrase it in those terms is that that you're keeping hold of?
B	er I don't know
A	is it perhaps you know the sentiment or love that another human being has for you?
B	sentiment love yeah sort of not nostalgia for happier times cos that's bullshit but erm I don't know
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	It's difficult for speaker B to decide what to do with the Valentine's card.	Entailment
B	there's er you know I've got
B	I have these boxes I think I've got two boxes as well and I go through them maybe every year or every two years and each time I go through them I get rid of
A	yeah
B	more stuff so I think as I'm getting older
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B doesn't throw away things.	Contradiction
A	are you adding in the meantime?
B	erm not adding so much because of I guess because of technology
A	I was just thinking that yeah
B	there is less stuff like that around
A	yeah
B	people write to me my friend
A	ah
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B adds many thing in the box the last few years.	Contradiction
B	and that'll go in the box er but you know stuff and it's not necessarily
A	yeah
B	er it's just you know your mm maybe not your values change but er the things that are important change
A	mm
B	and er
A	yeah
B	do I really need to hold onto this? er whatever it is
A	yeah
B	so
A	yeah
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Values don't change for speaker B.	Contradiction
A	so all the sympathy cards have gone
B	mm
B	uhu
A	and I think it is just sort of yeah love
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	There are more cards in other boxes.	Neutral
B	yeah
A	is most of the stuff that's left oh and my mum
B	mm
A	yeah
A	mm
B	oh
B	the way she's just stood there
B	ah
A	no I it's funny I can tell whether I'm gonna pick a hitchhiker up from about half a mile away
B	uhu
A	I know
B	what? sort of what? just like a sense?
A	I dunno just yeah and complete instinct and I just knew looking at them I wasn't gonna pick them up
B	mm
A	yeah
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	and I I do tend to pick up quite a lot but I dunno couldn't tell you why but instinct said no so no it is
B	have you ever hitchhiked?
A	yeah only little bits
B	uhu
A	like when I've been staying in a hostel and wanna get into town
B	uhu
A	and do some shopping and get back again that sort of thing
B	mm
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	I met a lot of serious hitchhikers travelling New Zealand
B	mm
A	erm
B	yeah
A	and you know there it was just expected and it was kind of nice for for the hitchhikers as well because you all end up doing the hostel scene you end up sort of bumping into cos New Zealand's
B	yeah
A	so small you bump into people like a month later
B	uhu
A	that get pissed and stay up late and I had a rental car for a lot of that trip and
B	yeah
A	so consciously chose to get off the beaten track and that's where I tended to find different sorts of hitchhikers
B	uhu
A	who like me wanted to get off
B	more seasoned yeah
A	yeah wanted to get off the beaten track lots of women travelling on their own in New Zealand
B	uhu
A	perfectly safe country to do that in erm so yeah I gave lifts to lots of single women also couples groups of men you know just
B	uhu
A	again on instinct and vibes man
B	mm yeah my friends hitchhiked I think they hitchhiked around France or from France around Italy something like this
A	look at this
B	they went on quite a long journey oh goodness me
A	that's so cool
B	erm
A	yeah
B	I can put you up for the night and
A	yeah
A	and you hear all these fearful tales of axe murderers and you get all these Hollywood movies
B	yeah but no one says it you know?
A	that portray the worst of humanity but
B	it's like er reviews on Amazon no one really writes about how good stuff is
A	mm
B	they just tend to write about the bad stuff or you know book reviews or whatever
A	I think you might be right
B	I don't think it's too far along cos I remember that nightclub
A	yeah I I just noticed the silhouette of the stripper woman
B	yeah
A	what on earth is that? yeah what on earth is that silhouette of and I realised it is a woman on her knees with her head flung backwards
B	mm
A	I wondered for a moment had she been decapitated
A	or something
A	I don't know
B	yes
A	and I'm going to be living here hooray
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	maybe you know spend a month working the B and Bs and guest houses or something
B	mm
B	yes
A	be good
B	yeah it's really really nice
A	this car I think this car behind wants to overtake might be out of luck for the next hour
A	oh no there you go pal if you're quick
B	go on fast
A	no? fair enough he's got a
A	yeah
A	probably
B	oh right
A	I wondered if it was just too cold for the speed cameras to work which
A	yeah
B	I don't know what the reasons are
A	but somebody else said they don't bother changing the film in Poland they're just like for decoration they don't actually do anything
B	ah right okay
A	so I dunno I did get
B	yeah
A	when you're going between Germany and Poland you need to change app
B	uhu
A	it doesn't you don't get a smooth transition so you need to try and work out on one app the road where it ends
B	mm
A	and anyway I fucked it up so on the border somewhere near Germany
B	mm
A	but the look of shock and surprise
B	yeah
A	on my face
B	and
A	could've won competitions I'm sure
B	and where would they send it to?
A	well exactly they'd send it back to
B	uhu
A	I don't know
A	yeah and had you turned left there you'd be heading to my hippies
B	mm
A	and on a beautiful road that gives you great views of these other mountains
B	so
A	yeah
B	Budapest on that bus
A	yes yeah somebody else said as well if you want to go to Kiev get on the bus and then you don't have the passport border problems
B	oh do you not?
A	no none at all whereas if you drive you can die of starvation
A	and with an exploding bladder waiting for the queue
B	uhu and on the train I think you can go on a train to Kiev erm
A	oh cool I'd like to do that
A	mm
B	or another place I figured it would be
B	yep which isn't too far people er people go for booze I think they just go on booze runs
A	oh yeah?
B	across the border and back yeah
A	I know
B	you just go to Ukraine and they give you free alcohol
A	yeah
B	mm
A	and presumably the same goes for train and it's
B	yeah
A	mega cheap you can like get a return ticket for a tenner or something stupid
B	yeah well I looked at erm the bus to
A	is that a tenner?
B	one way I think and then
A	yeah
B	someone else said oh they've
A	wow
B	so
A	that's amazing
B	yeah
A	is that a fiver? yeah cool
B	but the thought of going on a bus for so long just makes me feel quite ill
A	mm
B	I don't know
A	that's why you wanna travel with me
B	but I just don't think that I'll ever be organised enough to make a packed lunch to go anywhere
A	yeah
B	erm
A	I am the packed lunch queen
B	well
A	I am the travel food queen I must say
B	travel food queen
A	I really am
B	I will get better I will
A	yeah
B	erm whenever I fly I
A	should we require additional sustenance on our journey home
B	erm
A	look
B	it's beautiful
B	er in erm on flights I'm cos all the flights are at like ten in the morning back to
A	mm
A	mm
B	you know and I'm starving and every other
A	yeah got their sandwiches yeah
B	I'm like why don't I do this?
A	you think how did you manage that in your bring-on baggage allowance?
B	yeah
A	and fit your handbag in the same case
B	I just have too much stuff I don't have room for sandwiches can't be doing with it
A	yeah alternatively coat with massive pockets
B	coat with massive pockets
A	yeah
B	and Tupperware
A	yep small Tupperware
B	yep
A	yeah in fact I've got
B	uhu
A	which is great that does a couple of sandwiches squashed in and it's the perfect size for this big raincoat pocket that I've got
B	oh nice
A	yeah it's great
B	mm mm
A	as well
B	you know I just don't eat a lot of sandwiches
A	mm
B	avocado toast but I wouldn't ever think oh I'll just make myself a sandwich
A	mm
B	do you?
A	no I don't
B	no
A	no
B	er cos I eat erm
A	I don't do a lot of well I
B	yeah
A	I do out of convenience erm so I don't buy bread so I don't make sandwiches I buy wheat-free bread erm just because lately I've been enjoying erm
B	yeah
A	so beans on toast or erm
B	yeah
A	just as a little evening snack
B	I might start getting because you know I used to be way more
B	it's just sort of er
A	I used to get a roll from the roll shop
B	a custom yeah
A	mm yeah
B	buy a sandwich
A	I suppose you just can't in Poland
B	yeah and because you can't
A	if you want to buy a sandwich you can't
B	yeah you just
A	you can buy a waffle with a shitload of cream and treacle and chocolate sauce on it
B	yeah but you can't really buy a sandwich
A	can't buy a sandwich
B	you
A	no
B	erm so
A	can you? I don't think I've ever seen a sandwich
B	yeah you can in bakeries sometimes
A	oh I've seen stuffed rolls in bakeries
B	mm
A	erm from time to time in the entrance to the
B	yeah yeah but not sandwiches in
A	not sandwiches
B	square bread I guess
A	yeah
B	erm and I'd never have a sandwich for lunch cos I need real not real food but you know massive lunches
A	mm yeah
B	massive meals
A	I don't think bread is really a food substance I kind of treat it as erm it's usually if I've had a massive lunch which is quite often I just have a bit of beans on toast or a bit of peanut butter on toast
B	mm
A	for my tea as just like a little snack of an evening
B	mm
A	erm you know maximum what? three hundred calories? four hundred calories?
B	mm
A	nothing more erm
B	mm
A	but the type of energy that you're consuming isn't really sustaining
B	mm
A	I'd be more inclined to have something with rice or
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	cos in when I eventually get more organised
A	yeah
B	I generally don't have enough time
A	yeah
B	to eat it
A	change your job
B	but yeah it's only on Mondays that this is a problem
A	ah
B	erm where I do six hours flat out
A	mm can you take a protein shake? have you got something with a screw top lid?
B	yeah I have and I used to do do that in
A	yeah
B	but it's just not enough erm
A	I think with that kind of a day
B	to
A	yeah well
B	you know it's just like drinking water
A	yeah
B	erm
A	yeah
B	I just start sort of grabbing a biscuit which is the worst thing
A	yeah
B	so I might start making sandwiches
A	again it's not
B	Monday Wednesday
A	it's not really sustenance in a biscuit either
B	yeah but
A	you get sugar high sugar low
B	well yeah exactly
A	and you're worse than when you started
B	but it's grabbable and quick to eat
A	yeah
B	erm but if I start making sandwiches on Mondays and Wednesdays
A	mm
A	yeah could work
B	yeah
A	and I'm sure that made them really soggy
B	yeah
B	and will I have enough time to make them? erm
A	well you make enough time to make them
B	I have loads of time during the day I could make sandwiches yeah I'm making you know soup
A	mm
B	er soup and a curry you know before I go so
A	cos I don't think there's such a thing personally as not having time it's more not making time
B	well no it's not
A	there's
B	that I don't have time to make the sandwiches it's that I don't have time to eat
B	I don't have time to eat them
A	yeah
B	you know I first get to work at half two and finish at half eight
A	yeah
A	yep
B	or eleven and by half four of course you'll get hungry of course you can eat but then I think am I
A	yeah what about you?
B	during a lesson
A	I know
B	or with a private like or individual student am I allowed to just be like
A	give them a reading task that lasts at least seven minutes
B	yeah can you just please eat er can you just speak for a long time? and I'll try and eat something
A	yeah
B	mm
B	so yeah I wouldn't mind doing a big shop if you don't mind
A	yeah do you want er
B	oh god no
A	you wanted something out of
A	oh yeah yeah
A	to
B	yeah
B	so it's not sort of floating around in the water yeah
A	oh speed camera it's probably fifty
B	er so maybe not Tesco cos that er
A	Lidl?
B	really overwhelms me er
B	or or I could take you to
A	oh show me where the baked beans are yay yeah cos
B	uhu
A	the bastards
B	mm
A	erm but the last couple of occasions on which I have been I have found a distinct lack of baked beans so yeah
A	what?
B	yeah
A	yeah even they'd do
B	yeah
A	I mean I hate Tesco's on principle but you know they're kind of handy
B	mm yeah I've been using it a lot recently because it's such an easy location
A	mm
B	erm and they do have a good range actually
A	yeah
B	you know even though it's quite
B	a small one they have erm you know they sell like coconut oil and stuff
A	wow that's good
B	so
A	yeah I don't really like
B	yeah well
A	if you wanna do
B	I wouldn't mind doing
A	yeah
B	cos er I like buying meat from Lidl cos it's er really clear what it is
A	it's not dog or cat or hamster
B	well no you know if you try buying mince it's more often
A	yeah
B	than not pork
A	okay
B	erm
A	mm
B	because there is a picture of a cow on it
A	what did you need the butter for?
B	for the white sauce
A	oh okay
B	and I thought will it work with like oil? no
A	if you're ever really stuck this might sound bizarre erm and you've got some cauliflower
B	uhu
A	cauliflower and a little drop of milk in a blender makes a perfectly acceptable topping for
B	yeah
A	pasta bake things
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	it sounds crazy I mean it's not cheesy
A	it's er you know woah it's completely different
B	yeah
A	don't smash my windscreen erm yeah but no it's fine it's good
B	yeah and I didn't have didn't have any either so what I tried to do
A	oh
B	er
A	scrape off the burnt top inch?
B	it was fine
A	okay
B	it was not really
A	yeah
B	a lasagne so I'm gonna have another go tonight and then I'll have lasagne for the next couple of days and practise my lasagne technique now that I've got the time
A	good for you
B	yeah and now that I know what I'm doing
A	yeah
B	uhu
A	yeah
B	stop cooking start eating you've still got
A	yeah
A	mm yeah this is true well actually no I'm leaving the last weekend of February
B	uhu okay
A	so actually it'll probably be four weeks this weekend will it?
B	mm
A	yeah it will
B	hey we're flying have we turned north yet?
A	no we're still on this erm well actually yeah well we're heading north to Krakow and then we'll head east
B	uhu
A	to
B	mm
A	oh it's just gone down from ten degrees to nine and a half degrees bloody hell we were in double digits there
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	just
B	I was looking at the temperatures in
A	wow
B	but
A	oh oh what? for
B	yeah
A	oh that's a bit miserable I hoped she'd have nice weather
B	I know I think there is on Saturday
A	mm she's flying home on Saturday isn't she? oh no Monday
B	I've gone a bit chilly again have you?
A	yeah I'll put the thingy on
B	yes I think
A	I often wonder about the translations and you know when you get like even a half-syllable word like
B	uhu
A	which is more just a grunty noise who's this big flappy bird? wow that's no buzzard it looks like a
B	wow that's a huge bird
A	wow that er wow I don't know what that is wow it's a bird of prey and I don't know what it is come on in then look you're in a fucking Passat for god's sake
B	mm
A	translates in Polish as something like bridge across the river where the hawks hunt
B	ah
A	or something like that
B	I don't think they mean anything
A	do you not? no
B	well you know if you look at place names in England
A	mm
B	they don't mean anything a lot of them
B	well yeah
A	bridge over the
B	well but
A	apart from that
B	very
B	what does that mean?
A	I dunno but
B	mm
A	I don't know that he's buried there I don't know
A	my goodness I'm overtaking things
B	I know we're doing very she's on the phone though so
A	oh right fair enough
A	yeah so more clearing clutter for me I'm really quite enjoying it actually
B	uhu
A	I suppose cos I have something to do when I don't have any playmates
B	yeah
A	and I think part of erm this living on my own out of town experience has been very good for me to realise I do actually quite like humans
B	uhu good
A	whereas previously I've kind of had it in my head that I don't really like people
B	uhu
A	particularly children
B	uhu
A	and actually that hasn't shifted much I don't particularly like children and I love cats
B	uhu
A	but yeah it's kind of brought home to me now how I am a social animal I do crave human contact and I haven't really had the conscious awareness of that fact before living where I live
B	mm
A	so it's served a role and purpose and now it does my head in and I get bored
B	mm
A	which I never thought would've happened
B	yeah it's difficult isn't it? erm
A	mm
B	but you crave contact with a a different kind of person
A	yeah
B	cos you can't build this same er you're not on the same level with your students or with your colleagues necessarily as you are with your friends I mean colleagues that you see sort of every day and you say hi how are you?
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	erm
A	yeah
B	and I still do and I really need and crave time alone
A	yeah
B	and as much as I need and crave time with other people so
A	that's a lot less for me than I think it ever has been
B	uhu
A	I always used to really crave time on my own
A	erm
B	mm
B	uhu
A	living there on my own
B	mm
A	doing the crossword
B	yeah
A	and just pop into the pub and do a quiz I knew you know I've got
B	mm
B	yeah and sometimes you want to do it and sometimes you don't cos
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah and I wonder if I have a greater appreciation of human contact and company living here because I don't have those options because I don't have that wider social circle spread
B	uhu
A	over a larger geographical area and I don't have those relationships that I've built with people over years so
B	yeah
A	it is different yeah it's
B	mm
A	yeah
B	and I think as much as that yeah and I also sort of really
A	mm
B	er I really have to to keep myself happy not do things
A	yeah
B	sometimes or not do anything or you know not join in
B	yeah
A	mm
B	yeah
A	looking out the window daydreaming whatever it may be
B	yeah whatever and then just think it's okay to go no I don't wanna do that today or
A	yeah
B	and not have to come up with stuff come up with excuses and just say don't wanna do it
A	yeah fair enough
A	what's that sign mean then? blue background with a white car with a red cross through it
A	I've no idea
A	so nothing in the outside lane need to pull over quickly
B	yeah
A	it looked
B	I've no idea
A	it was sort of dark grey with bits of white on its undercarriage it's really a weird colour combination for such a large bird of prey I really can't imagine what it was
B	don't know
A	cos it was more grey and than brown erm other birds that I know really well red kite wrong colour wrong shape
B	mm
A	sparrowhawk kestrel it was way bigger erm
A	have to look it up when we get home
B	you shall
A	so there's a place coming up fairly soonish like in the next twenty minutes where I'll pull in and get some diesel and have a wee if we want to
B	excellent
A	I think you it's probably
B	yeah
A	and a good purge and a good clear so that's my theory
B	yep you're probably right
A	and my instincts suggest you probably are gonna need
B	sorry
A	cos I think well fuck
B	I know
A	I might have to
A	go and find some random strangers who'll speak English to me
B	text
A	oh yeah that's true
B	she's great
A	who likes her own space a lot
B	mm
A	which is fair enough
B	yeah she keeps herself to herself I mean she comes out when she's invited
A	yeah
B	erm
A	yeah I might just give her a random she uses Viber rather than WhatsApp
B	uhu
A	I'll give her a random message just to say I'm about let me know if you want coffee or lunch
B	yeah she's great
A	yeah
B	got a lot of time for her
B	mm?
B	do you think?
A	yeah that similar sort of a fitness freak sporty vibe but with some
B	you know
A	I know
B	she's like I've not been to the gym since the summer
A	wow
B	it's like
A	because then she she then
A	in the very next breath talks about this year I'm going to get a six-pack
A	okay I think that's why maybe she just talks a good fitness rather than actually doing it
B	yeah I think she was really fit at the beginning of last year
A	mm
B	maybe she's like me and she does sort of
A	half and half yeah
B	and she was telling me you know in
A	yeah
B	going to her gym erm so no she's not a fitness freak
B	ah she's just erm
A	I think I might quite enjoy having that conversation with her
B	yeah
A	that's funny
B	cos
A	yeah
B	but since I've known her I don't think she's exercised
A	she's just not
A	I need to pull in here cos I get scared breaking speed limits in foreign countries
A	and then you're in a car with
B	oh I know
A	and then there's just one speed and that's fast but she's funny ah yes here we are yeah speed trap
A	oh my goodness you're so popular
B	thirteen degrees on the blue lift and lots of people are you
A	is that
B	oh yeah sorry
A	pulling over in the next
B	okay bye
