A	well that's going to be make us absolutely dry
A	we're having um stuffed
B	okay
A	and vegetables
C	beef tomatoes
A	and there's some
C	you won't have those will you?
A	it didn't describe them as beef tomatoes so you're alright
B	well doesn't beef just mean they're really big?
A	I think so yes
C	well
A	Good
A	now they did
C	hm
A	and it's got feta cheese with it
B	oh
B	um
B	oh that sounds weird
A	so there's um parsley and
C	oregano
A	yes there's a little but the oregano was dried
B	rice yes
A	yes
B	Jamie Oliver?
A	should've done more or less of what he said
B	so it'll be Jamie Olivie's Oliver's book
A	no it wasn't from a book
B	oh okay
A	that you get recipes from TV chefs from time to time
B	yes
A	yes
B	on Channel Four as well I think they do the same thing
A	well I
B	mm
A	so I just copy them
B	yes
A	and then if I  if I  think of it I can use them from there
B	mm
A	so I've got a an odd assortment
B	uh
A	I hoped so
B	mm
A	so it is quite tasty isn't it? As a result
C	it's not bad this
A	well
A	but the
C	nothing seems to have spoilt it
A	Good
A	uh oh nuts is the other one that he wouldn't go for
B	I haven't found any pistachios
A	well you perhaps
B	mm
A	what what you
B	ooh
A	right some of them
B	mm
A	so maybe because I I was getting
B	oh
A	it might've ground some of them up rather a lot
B	yeah
A	I did those yes
B	hm
A	which was quite nice that you would
B	yeah
A	because it gave me time to assemble it all
B	yeah
A	but I mean I was thinking I'd have
B	yeah
A	and leave it and I I was lucky it was something I could leave in the oven so
B	well the reason I have to get back is because we're going to see that film
A	ah
B	mm
A	who you going with?
B	I'm going with all the people I'm going to India with except for
A	right
B	mum he's in Portsmouth sailing
A	he gets some holidays in doesn't he?
B	he does
A	is he a skilled uh practice sailor?
B	well
A	did he sail when he was being brought up in New Zealand?
B	um I think so yeah
A	you'd expect that to be
B	his dad's into sailing so
A	right
B	he's done quite a bit of it though the last time he did any was almost two years ago I think
A	why's it free? Who's supplying them?
B	I suppose they might pay
A	I see
B	so
C	is that at Portsmouth?
B	it's at Portsmouth yeah on
A	is it on the sea?
C	on the?
B	it's at Port Solent yeah which I've been to
A	yes
B	mm
A	what d'you mean back a
B	he's back a similar time to me
A	tonight?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	and
A	would you like to sail?
B	um I'd like
C	you did some sailing didn't you?
A	not really no I
A	was a that idea was aborted really
B	where did she grow up?
A	um
B	okay
A	um her father was very keen on it
B	mhm
A	so um between them I think they probably do sail a fair bit cos they've gone to
B	mm
A	I think it's ideal for them you've got a very opportunity to do it
B	yeah
A	um no I
A	the idea on
B	of course
A	dad's heard of him
B	yes I've heard of him
A	um
C	there were plenty of others
B	didn't you go to the theatre with him or something
A	so I had to go round Earl's Court with him looking at boats cos I've no knowledge or interest in them really
B	yeah
A	but I did think I might so so when I went to North Wales to do my teacher's certificate
C	I was President of the sailing club
A	oh no you weren't
A	I joined the sailing club in the thoughts that with the thought that they might teach me to sail and I might enjoy it
B	yes
A	I didn't  I didn't  feel it was me so
B	mm
A	I didn't do any more
B	but you get seasick
A	well I thought on small boats I'd be alright I didn't
B	maybe you were
A	I mean when I went out with
B	mm
A	yes quite
C	you can sail at Rutland Water
B	mm
C	you could couldn't you?
A	I could
B	you could do any kind of
A	well
B	boats
C	I think there's a long waiting list getting to the club
A	ah
C	I think at one time there were too many people
A	well if you think about it
C	quite
A	so
C	yes I can't think of anywhere else here
A	I mean I suppose you'd have to go somewhere like Northamptonshire for is it?
C	maybe you you could sail on
A	mm you have to have a fair sized lake
C	you do yes
A	to make it worthwhile don't you?
C	yes
B	mm
A	what other reservoirs are there anywhere near?
A	none any in North North Lincolnshire or anything like that?
C	well there's
A	might be a long way to go
C	covenham remember that's a long way to go
A	what about um the Fens
C	no
C	bogs and fens
B	and overflowing rivers
A	could you go to the Norfolk coast to sail?
C	you could
A	do do people? Is there the? I mean
C	Blakeney
A	for all I know some areas of coast are a lot better for sailing
C	Blakeney's a sailing centre
A	than others
C	you could go uh Holme
B	really?
C	mm
B	I would expect that to be by the sea
A	that's a long way to travel
C	no no no this is in the Trent Valley
A	Cos
B	well yeah
A	I think it's quite expensive to have a boat
B	I think so
A	or expensive in terms of time even if you don't pay a lot for the boat cos you have to maintain them as well as use them
B	yeah
A	and if you're going far you have to be
B	to have a boat
A	so Will is is passing taking a certificate is he?
B	no he's so he's done the yacht master cos the yacht master is not practical it's just theoretical so they learn about um
A	navigation
B	I think they learn about navigation yeah
A	is that the first time he's taken any kind of qualification?
B	yeah yeah I think he just wanted to do it and I think he uh his parents paid for it or something as a birthday present or something like that
A	uhuh
B	so
A	oh oh right did you have did he have any kind of get-together?
B	no cos it was um
A	why's that?
B	he just doesn't particularly
A	not bothered? About it?
B	no doesn't particularly um feel it necessary
A	well perhaps it's over the years he's he's always been away from home and not had a lot of opportunity
B	well no I think there'd be more opportunity to do stuff uh in Cambridge
A	with the students
B	I know that the year before when I didn't really know him um he had
A	ahh
B	like not really a party but sort of more of like a drinks before formal thing
A	mm
B	and um he he doesn't like surprises
B	but that didn't occur to them or they didn't realize that
A	why doesn't I mean
B	well
A	has he had a surprise on some occasion that upset him?
B	no I don't think so I think it's more that he likes to be in control and have everything planned
A	does he?
B	not of what he's doing but uh you know what a a future diary
A	not what he has done?
B	no no no no like
C	got up
B	no
A	do you still keep a diary?
B	not really no
A	it's um
B	yeah
C	yes
B	yeah
A	how many years did you keep it up for?
B	uh probably
A	that's wonderful
B	yeah
A	things in life since
B	that's the thing
A	yeah but you just can't fit it in
B	it's just there's no time and also I think what what I do now is I keep a scrapbook
A	mm
B	it's actually not really a scrapbook it's my old one of my old art books the sketch books that I that we had
A	well yes
A	now you're not so sure
B	I think I always liked the idea of recording things
A	mm
B	in case I wanted to look back
A	the closest I've come to that is is just
B	I don't read it either
A	I'm just just writing up things I've read
B	oh films and
A	or watched or
B	oh it
A	well it's I've somebody said it was a commonplace book cos they saw me with it when I went to the lecture
B	oh this is really interesting
A	but this doesn't commit me to anything on a daily basis
B	no no but that's what I  that's what I  do and that's what I like about it
A	yes
A	that I need to write about
B	no this is really interesting though
A	can't take them back to the library yet because I haven't
B	so you write all about the books? Cos I just
A	well my problem is that over my lifetime of reading I've read quite a lot of books but have little memory of what they're about any more because my memory's not that good and I just feel what a shame not to be able to turn up
B	what they ever were yeah
A	you know I I'm likely to remember roughly when I read something in terms of
B	yeah
A	well especially at the moment cos it's my
B	oh you did see you saw Wuthering Heights as well
A	um I
B	I don't know I don't think you did
A	well had you read it before?
B	no
A	oh I see
B	you told me when
A	oh did I?
B	yeah
A	I I I
B	what this recent film version?
A	yes
B	but
A	but
B	is it okay if I have some more?
A	yes
C	she eats very slowly Mum does
A	well it's because I'm so busy nattering
C	whereas I really just sort of polish it off in no time
A	it's unusual for me to finish before you as you well know
C	I keep a bird diary
A	yes
B	yes
C	mm
A	that's red pepper but what I've done is tomato if you prefer it
C	I might prefer the tomato yes
A	I think it's the one in the middle
C	which what's?
A	try I think that's probably it but I may be wrong
C	I don't want
A	that's it in the middle
A	and you can take all the etceteras
C	are they the uh etceteras?
A	uh you've got some more tomato there if you want it
C	no I
A	right
B	I can peel
A	something
B	D'you want some more bread?
C	yes please
B	mm mm there aren't really many left to have
C	oh I'll finish them shall I?
A	the um
C	yes
A	um but what I don't do is is what he does which is to write it all up afterwards properly in the correct order of that that the birds should appear in well should be noted in
A	I all I do cos I know I wouldn't do it after the event is I take it with me and when we're in a hide or we get back to the car I write it up then
A	I mean
B	yeah
A	what are you looking for?
C	butter knife
A	there
B	in the butter
C	oh
A	and I'm very pleased that I've started to do that
B	mm
A	Cos I've been doing that more or less
B	mm
A	so two years has filled this book
B	oh
A	I have
B	mm
A	so started the same
B	is it the same?
A	no it's
A	it's not unfortunately it's not the same no
B	mm
A	need something that's that's standard that's going to reappear regularly don't you? Have your
C	no
C	um but I bought more than one last time I bought any
A	that's a good idea
C	mm
B	didn't you have those red and black ones?
C	well that's what I use now
B	oh
C	but I used to use um a red one
C	which was ideal as they claim
A	mm that's what
C	but I can't find anywhere
B	mm
A	where did you find them oh from originally Smiths?
C	pardon?
A	where did you get them from W H Smiths originally?
C	something like that yes W H Smiths yes
B	mm
A	they do change what they what there's in stock for some time
B	well
C	well those are recent
B	oh
B	no I'm full thanks
B	well I don't think I can have any dessert now
A	oh you can't not
C	broccoli?
B	well later
A	what shall we do? Shall we save it till later?
B	yeah yeah
C	like broccoli?
B	it's not broccoli
A	looks more like parsley to me
C	yes that's the thing
B	I don't know why there's broccoli on a butter wrapper
C	would you like it?
B	no I think I'm I'm definitely full for now
A	Good
B	it's quite filling
A	we don't either
B	mm
A	D'you have anything different at breakfast on a day when you're playing hockey?
B	um
A	anything more substantial or about the same?
B	mm
A	practice cake?
B	yeah as in I made a big cake for you
A	oh that one
C	one she made earlier
B	um
C	did they?
B	yeah
C	mm
B	um
B	yeah
A	no
B	oh in
A	it's bicarbonate of soda or baking powder
B	yeah
A	yes
B	so we were making these cupcakes and the recipe called for um three
B	luckily it didn't open until it sort of hit the mixture
B	so only a bit went in
B	I would only put baking powder in it
A	right
B	oh really
A	yes
B	of baking powder yeah but
A	but it just
B	mm
A	I'm not sure what the other what's the other ingredient?
B	I think it's cream of tartar we were talking about this yesterday
A	yes that's right
B	anyway we managed to scoop out most of the um bicarbonate of soda and they tasted okay in the end
A	oh well that would mask any nasty taste from the bicarb
B	yeah
C	brilliant it does rather doesn't it?
B	yes
A	the worst thing I ever
C	just a wedding
B	I've forgotten to put sugar in cake in a cake before
A	did the cake work?
B	it worked fine
A	spongy but you you could mask it then if you put jam in?
A	no still not good?
B	no
A	for his birthday cake
B	well
A	and
B	yeah yeah well we were singing on Tuesday cos there's the
A	yes
B	hasn't come yet
A	have you told him you're waiting for the
B	I've well said I'm really sorry I don't have a present for you it's not arrived yet
A	mhm
B	like he doesn't seem remotely bothered by it
A	no
B	but then they
B	it's all done through Amazon but it's individual sort of vendors within Amazon
A	yes
B	so I ordered it again from a different one and hopefully on Monday I'll get an email saying it's been dispatched
A	yes
B	I just hope it turns up eventually
A	so when are you hoping to have some kind of
B	well I think
A	yes
B	just for his birthday
A	the cakes
B	no I'll give him the cake today tonight
A	so you'll have time to see him tonight before you go down
B	hopefully
A	mhm
B	um
A	well it doesn't matter it's the gesture that matters
B	I know exactly exactly yeah
A	um and in any case it makes a lot of sense if you're buying exotic ingredients as you have done for a  for a  cake to make more than one at the same time
A	I see
B	mm
A	yes
B	yeah
A	well it's the thought that counts isn't it?
B	mm
A	more often that not
B	I would've made him a card as well but I didn't have any time at all
A	mm
A	well
A	mm
B	for the card anyway
A	mm
B	um but I I didn't have any inspiration
A	sailing card for him
B	I that's what
A	have you got a sailing joke Peter? Cos that might uh
C	A sailing joke?
B	sailing joke
A	sailing joke
C	I don't think so
A	there were one or two jokes that Dad was telling and I that seemed quite quite good
B	and did you find that he'd got them from?
A	and I said Well you know you supply the jokes get
A	Don't remember which those jokes were but they just seem to me appropriate
C	mm
A	not for specific occasions but you know a lot of greetings cards are not for specific
B	yeah
C	no I don't think I have any sailing jokes
A	now
B	um
A	Peter have you had enough? Would you like some fruit?
C	I wouldn't mind the odd grape
A	right
B	I might have some grapes with cake later
A	but I got some ice
B	yeah yeah
C	I don't mind what we have
A	yes could you eat some ice cream now?
B	I
A	alright let's do that then
B	well we don't need to clear any of the stuff away yet
A	right
B	okay
C	you fancy having a bit more do you?
B	well um
C	well I mean from these here
B	oh no
B	with with with dessert no
C	actually I will take some of these out
B	okay well um
C	oh yes alright
C	yes I certainly can
B	I'm surprised you you liked it
C	well
B	I think it's really nice
C	mm
B	feta cheese and pistachios
C	what are the
B	pistachios yeah
C	are they herbs?
B	no they're nuts
C	are they? Oh yes
B	pistachio nuts
C	oh yes pistachios yes
B	um I don't know where they're from
C	I'm not good on nuts
C	I can't recognize them
B	well I don't know if they're
[ANNOTATION]	Person B is going to do some hair cut	Contradiction
C	not real nuts yeah quite
B	yeah
C	Cos nuts presumably are just a
B	yeah but I think some of them I think they have to shells
C	Don't know much about nuts really
B	Brazil nuts are the ones that aren't
C	they don't have shells do they?
B	they do they have those yeah
C	oh they do yes
B	um
C	yes well we've probably eaten them all
C	yes
B	at the moment?
C	at the moment it's empty
B	has it got some kind of seeds in?
C	has sunflower hearts in it
[ANNOTATION]	Person C think seeds are like plant heart	Neutral
C	they hardly take any from that at all
B	oh yeah
C	oh yes well I mean all of
B	oh yeah
C	which is good for them
B	A green one?
C	no a great spotted
B	mm
C	on on those peanuts on the right hand side there
[ANNOTATION]	Person C said that it is on the right hand side	Entailment
B	yesterday when I was cycling from hockey it's sort of the hockey pitch I was at is off
C	mm
B	um it's
C	right I know where the
[ANNOTATION]	Person C know that where was the hockey	Entailment
B	um
C	and
C	I don't know
B	yeah
B	it's sort of down the end there
[ANNOTATION]	Person B is going to do some hair cut	Contradiction
C	mm
B	um and I was cycling out from it towards the road towards
C	running along the ground?
B	yeah
C	how big was it?
B	like well it was
C	oh no that wouldn't be a partridge
B	well um I'm wondering what it was cos it was it didn't look as if it was sort of
A	why wouldn't that be a partridge if that?
C	because partridges are bigger than moorhens
A	are they?
C	yes
A	quail
C	well quail are summer visitors
B	it's very strange
C	there wasn't um? You say it was about moorhen size?
B	well this it's really hard to tell
C	are there a lot of reeds and so on there?
B	there would have been across the road cos there's that ditch the the brownish like um sort of mottled brown I would say
C	mm
B	no it was too far away
C	that does sound like a partridge
B	it
C	mm
A	it's very difficult
C	it is yeah
B	yeah that's the thing
A	I that's what I think
C	well that's true even in uh experienced birdwatchers yeah
A	look I'm sorry the ice cream is beginning to run away
C	is it? Fine
B	that's fine
A	right
B	thanks
C	ah thank you very much
A	I think that is probably a similar amount but if you want some more of this you can have it
C	right
A	I'm gonna have my grapes afterwards
B	I'm gonna have one with it
A	yeah well I
A	being a purist I probably would have them afterwards
A	or is it before that is the
B	I don't know
A	I think the work
B	oh really?
A	which seem
B	mm
A	so that
B	yeah
A	she's not going to be able to alter the switch uh if she needs something as simple as possible
B	yeah
A	and I don't want it to be too loud for her in that case because uh sometimes she feels as though with the hearing aids everything is really coming at her
B	mm
A	and difficult for her to cope with
B	yeah
A	um
B	yeah
A	she
B	yeah I find that when I'm talking
A	yeah yes but this is with the new phone I don't
A	oh you've if you spoke to her yesterday?
B	yeah she um
A	it's made a huge difference
B	mm
A	it's made a huge difference
B	yeah
A	unfortunately she doesn't then remember the explanation but she seems to follow it generally at the time
B	yeah
A	which helps
B	yeah
A	uh so we had the audiologist and then
B	mm
A	who wanted a meeting because it appears that some a couple of the carers have said they can't manage Granny
B	mm
A	with in terms of the lifting without straining themselves
B	oh yeah
A	now they are not technically supposed to do any lifting
B	mm
A	and basically she said that they can't now a
B	mhm
A	which means now that she's got to have two visits two visitors
B	yeah
A	now that's alright
B	yeah
A	so
B	as in earlier than you know sort of eight o'clock yes
A	eight o'clock in the morning yes yeah that sort of time
B	Cos what time do they normally come eleven?
B	yeah
A	I was sort of pushed into um agreeing to what I agreed to with
B	but that's stupid though why would they say that because surely they need to
B	yeah
A	break her hip and that could be the end of her because people of
B	yeah true
A	um
B	yeah yeah
A	who mustn't hurt their backs and so on
B	yeah
A	yes yeah
B	they shouldn't be threatening you they should be trying to come up with a solution that works for both
A	yes
B	yeah
A	I have met her before
B	hard as in unfriendly
A	um
B	or as in difficult?
A	demanding I suppose
B	yeah
A	you know she was demanding this cos she'd heard I was there
B	mm
A	when I met her face to face it was a lot better
B	yeah
A	and
B	mhm
A	I think she turned out to be one of the ones that had
B	yeah
A	now she's in a strong position because she's a really valued carer so it helps
B	yeah
A	um so we had quite a long discussion
B	yeah
A	uh and
B	yeah
A	and then she said well I think what's needed
B	yeah
A	and I've seen these because actually it turns out it was one of the apparatuses that the OT brought with
B	yeah
A	to try for Granny
B	oh really?
A	because because of the pressure on her knees from it
B	mm
A	but
B	yeah
A	and it would be supplied free
B	yeah
A	and and it sounds absolutely excellent
B	oh
A	if they can get her to
B	yeah
A	it's it's well well no it's it's it's them being moved from the bed onto the chair to go into the bathroom or anything else
B	mhm
A	that that it it's designed for
B	yeah
A	I don't actually in
B	yeah that'd be brilliant
A	now I've uh had a lot of argy-bargy with with Granny as well because she's
A	she's um she agreed to have a carer in first thing in the morning
B	mm
A	but as soon as Granny knew it was going to happen she's created
B	what
A	she'd uh she because she had forgotten that she'd said it would be a good idea
B	yeah
A	uh and was difficult with her and and with complained to me afterwards and so on and
B	yeah
A	so that's experimental
B	yeah
A	but one thing that happened that was upsetting was that she was supposed to have a visit an an evening visit with two carers coming in um at eight thirty in the evening it was scheduled for
B	yeah
A	and they turned up at seven thirty
B	oh well that's no good
A	and Granny had only had one couple of hours before that
B	yeah
A	and it was too early
B	yeah
A	because she didn't need pads changing at that time
B	yeah
A	well uh and it was upsetting for Granny
B	right
A	well if they're if that's going to happen
B	did you make sure they hadn't just got the time wrong?
A	no
B	no no that like the
A	they well
B	yeah
A	and I
B	yeah
A	and I can confirm that it had finished by ten to eight
B	yeah but have you checked with uh
A	I have checked with
B	eight thirty
A	and they came a whole hour early
B	well at least now they know
A	so so
B	that they've got it wrong
A	she's
B	yeah
A	and last night whoever it was they came at about the right time
B	yeah
A	but I've said to
B	yeah
A	and they they'd shifted it without shifting the afternoon visit forward
B	yeah
A	so that's why the interval was completely wrong
B	yeah
A	they they'd done that as a kind of makeshift I think for the moment so that this week then they could start the whole thing differently so I think Granny might get a visit at four o'clock this afternoon
B	oh yeah yeah
A	which is I've reviewed it and I've talked to Auntie
B	oh no
A	um and a whole morning trying to speak to
B	yeah
A	um uh and as a result um
B	yeah
A	but I was worried that she'd be changing a lot of carers and it would be difficult for Granny
B	yeah
A	to cope with
B	yeah that's the thing
A	yeah but it's it's
B	yeah
A	if she doesn't like it she doesn't
B	she won't do it yeah
A	and then she's in distress next day cos things weren't right and
[ANNOTATION]	The woman has a stable job and does not need to change her career.	Contradiction
B	I thought you were gonna say that they that somebody had said that they can't manage her as in like she complains too much or is too difficult
A	well um I don't know
C	people are used to that
A	I was saying that's there's that as well
B	yeah
A	but
B	mm
A	I had to take her to the bathroom at half past ten at night
B	yeah
A	get her back to bed
B	mm
A	well I don't have the proper techniques anyway
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A is a nurse with a specialty in taking care of the elderly.	Contradiction
B	mm
A	and and this you know I my muscles were hurting and my shoulders were all
B	yeah you're not supposed to do it you'll
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A did not have the strength to handle the old woman.	Entailment
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A did not have a problem with handling the old woman.	Entailment
A	I couldn't get the pads on properly for her and she was too cos she was too tired to help me by moving over
B	mm
A	so I mean I've got every sympathy with the
B	yeah
A	for
B	no
A	um Waitrose
B	waitrose
A	yeah
C	say no more
A	he'll feel he's got to eat them all up
C	oh yeah the
C	mm
B	no it's not but uh and basically cos yesterday was a science festival um in Cambridge and so one of the sort of parts of this was uh it was a sort of a whole day of lectures called ThinkCon um and
A	ah this is the festival we heard about is it perhaps last year and I thought Ooh there's some good things
B	you might have done yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A is not satisfied with the current situation of taking care of the old lady.	Entailment
A	or unless they have another one in the summer
B	no I think  I think  it's a yearly thing um cos there were lots of events uh they need people who were helping out at various events
A	mhm mm
B	but um
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A hates the old woman and feels no pity for her in her current state.	Contradiction
A	right
B	um so she'd heard of him um and like read her read his work and stuff
A	of course she wanted to go yes
B	and also he'd published a paper in Plus One relatively recently
A	were they free lectures?
[ANNOTATION]	The old woman has amnesia.	Neutral
B	uh they were free it was brilliant yeah absolutely you just to have to reserve a ticket
A	mm
B	um
C	V V2s and V1s
B	yeah
A	is this
B	she's not a scientist
A	no it's just that there was
B	oh that older one?
A	she's very knowledgeable
B	yeah
A	this was a young woman yeah
B	I know what you mean of that older one
A	I don't know
B	I don't even know who you're talking about
A	not Jocelyn Bell
B	who's
A	Jocelyn Bell is an
B	anyway
A	she
B	I oh yeah no it wasn't her
C	she knows everybody
B	clearly
A	they're the only odd one that I think yeah
B	yeah
A	that's who it is
B	was she another old girl there?
A	yeah
B	oh was she?
A	right
B	um cos basically his subject is um well relates to kind of paranormality and uh like why we
A	ah okay
B	yeah
A	there's a scientific explanation for all these things
B	yeah
A	yes
B	and he was you know like his explanations he didn't go into great detail
A	mm
B	and um it's a sort of a survival instinct in a way because your brain couldn't possibly you know process every single thing as it is
A	I've seen that
B	it has to take shortcuts
A	yes there was somebody talking about that recently on TV
B	yeah
A	whether it was him I don't know
B	uh I don't know it's like um you know when you read a word the letters can be any in any order as long as the first letter and the last letter are in the right place you'll read the word
B	yes
B	um so your brain takes shortcuts all the time
C	oh yes
B	yeah
C	logos sometimes make use of that
B	yes
A	you can get books with lots of optical illusions on different pages
B	yeah
C	yes
B	it was the sort of optical illusions and also like uh picking out faces and that sort of thing he was saying that it's just what the brain does because obviously the brain uh is it's really important faces are so important for people
A	it's trying to make sense of what it sees and the sense it makes may be false sense
B	yeah
B	you know you're more likely to see a face where it's not there and it's more ecologically important economically
A	and did he refer to so-called ghosts as a product of that kind?
B	yes
A	what happens though what if they appear on a photo and they we know it's not been cooked?
B	he showed us some photos
A	yes
A	and he looked he had it for years um and sort of was looking at it thinking You know this one this one seems almost like it could be genuine
A	was it streaks? Are they streaky?
B	you know if you take your pair of glasses off and it's got the little plastic coating on the bit that goes behind your ear?
A	yes
B	was that bit and it was like hooking round but it looked like a streaking ball of light
A	mm mm
B	yeah
A	um
B	and there are like blotches of light?
A	they haven't actually seen it themselves necessarily but
B	yeah
A	yes
B	like if you use the night setting when it's not night or I think if you use the
A	sometimes there could be have been a reflection from a window couldn't it?
B	yeah
A	ah
B	yeah
A	mm
B	um he
A	yes
B	mhm
A	uh and it was about part of the book was about um living alone going somewhere where you're really isolated
B	yeah
A	uh
B	yeah
A	and she
B	yeah
A	and she would hear them in the wind she'd just hear choruses and so on
B	her isolation
A	and I I sometimes connect this with Granny and her voices the voices that she apparently hears
B	oh yeah
A	would that be what it is? The the brain conjuring them up because it expects company
B	I don't know
A	mm
A	but when I'm at Cheltenham I mean it I and I go to bed I
B	yeah
A	but I know what it is
B	yeah
A	but it's funny how
B	and it's changing temperature
A	and or I've or
B	yeah
A	and and or because I've just walked over them and I've shut the bedroom door and there I am
B	yeah
A	but
B	yeah
B	that's the thing
A	or you don't want people that
B	yeah well that's what he was saying that um
A	you you try to make
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	because it sounds like footsteps and your brain's heard those before and that's what they sound like
B	but it's all just like
A	yes
B	basically everything can be explained
A	I
B	some of them yeah
A	well let me give you an example
B	he does mention that in his book
A	what does he say about that?
B	he didn't say
B	yeah
A	that it it can happen
B	well I don't see why
A	just as radio waves can be
B	yeah
A	exactly
B	but then in that case why wouldn't they do it all the time?
A	but the only
B	yeah
A	yes
B	you know
A	yes
B	um
A	loss of
B	yeah
A	we may have them in a residual form
B	yeah
A	the Elephant Whisperer?
B	the Elephant Whisperer yes
A	uh I didn't read it but I heard about him recently uh only the other day
B	oh really? Oh what did they say about him?
A	on TV or
B	did? Oh no really?
A	um aged sixty-one
B	how did he die?
A	I don't know but I don't think that's particularly significant but but after died
B	oh okay
A	and this was hadn't happened for a long time
B	they knew
A	as though they were mourning him
B	well that's what happened in the
A	because they were so close to him
B	in the book it tells how he would go on international trips and when he got back they'd be waiting for him
A	oh you hear that about dogs don't you? A dog knows when
B	yeah
A	the dog knows that that Master is returning
B	is coming home yeah
A	and goes there ready to greet
B	yeah
A	yes
B	yeah
A	so it really very readable is it?
B	yeah
