B	are you sure?
C	no I'm fine thank you
B	yeah?
C	mm
B	yeah that one nice and sweet
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	mm
C	there are cherries in the fridge
A	oh oh lovely
A	oh thank you
C	you know I saw your phone
A	yes
C	on the floor I thought there's another mouse here
C	cos it was dark out there and I just saw this shape and oh no
A	that's a long tail for it
A	mutant mouse
A	what have you found?
C	well people are
A	yeah
B	yeah I
A	well I don't like how they when you they can surprise you mice because they run incredibly fast
C	yeah
B	oh yeah
A	so if they're in a cupboard it is horrible
C	yeah
A	you put your hand in
C	yeah
A	of course it's terrified of you but it'll just run so fast it makes you scared
B	mm
A	yeah I don't like them
B	well even when you catch one it's not pleasant carrying them out on on these little things and
A	no
C	no
B	opened it up throwing him into the hedge somewhere
B	which is what I did the other day
C	you're very brave
A	yes
C	be back in a minute
A	you did well though catching him in a day
C	you did yeah
B	yes yeah
A	we both did it
B	oh did we? oh yeah
A	yes cos you saw the mouse when I was here you saw
B	oh did I? oh yeah
A	yes cos we were in the dining room and you said you saw it in the kitchen
B	mm
A	and I thought well I better have a look around
B	and you found droppings and stuff
A	and see if I could work out where they were no I was in the games room and I checked the fruit bowl and it had gnawed at the apple
B	but it's that's what I couldn't understand I said how could he get onto that apple?
A	mm no I don't understand still oh but anyway he obviously had and a kiwi fruit
B	I know yeah I know you were saying that er
A	yes I thought well they're in here that's where he is
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	but you had seen him in the kitchen
B	yeah
A	so I set them well we set them in both rooms three in one and two in the other
B	I've heard nothing more from them anyway
A	then you've got him no that's good yes hopefully the other one learnt his lesson
B	yeah yeah
A	mm
B	they caught those
A	oh they're no good
B	mm have you got any mice over at
A	not yet
B	no
A	mm bet they'll come had rabbits
B	oh there's one on the lawn now just as
A	oh have to catch him
B	fair size
B	mm
A	feel sad wouldn't you catching a rabbit?
B	I suppose years ago I think erm
A	mm well there's plenty of them
B	and he came back with erm a few rabbits in the back
A	did he shoot them or trap them?
B	I think I think he used to catch them actually cos I don't think he would have a gun
A	it's probably better because you'd have a time with the pellets otherwise wouldn't you?
B	yeah
A	snare or something sad though isn't it?
B	oh er wait er snare them then they go that's right yeah
A	mm with their foot it's a pretty nasty way to go though isn't it for an animal?
B	terrible way isn't it really you know yes
A	better to shoot them really but I suppose it makes a mess with the
B	yeah
A	especially if
B	yeah
A	you want the fur and probably they don't like to shoot them do they? cos it'll make a mess of the fur
B	no I I remember once buying a rabbit
A	that's right they do shoot them sometimes
B	they are there's a pellet inside it
A	yes you've got to watch that actually cos I've had erm
B	I've seen it
A	pellet in but it'll break your teeth if you bite down on one of those
B	mm
A	and game as well like pheasant they usually shoot those
B	no you don't like one swallowing a pellet do you I suppose?
A	no well it's the
B	yeah
A	it's more your teeth if you bite down on it
B	oh do they oh?
A	wreck your teeth mm
B	yeah yeah
A	they're really hard
B	mm
A	mm
B	do you buy rabbit?
A	I haven't actually I've never
B	no?
A	no I wouldn't mind that getting more game
B	I never see them in the shop now though
A	no I think you'd have to go to a local butcher I don't think you could get it through the supermarket we had venison for lunch
B	oh
A	it was delicious do you like venison?
B	yeah
A	mm it's absolutely lovely it's lovely meat really dark
B	yes we used to catch the erm
A	oh right
B	I still think there are one or two around but not many like
A	mm yes you've got you've got rabbits
B	I think I I think I saw one on the lawn the other day
A	mm and I saw one at the back by the bird table
B	oh did you? what? as close as that?
A	mm it was just sitting there don't know why they come up there there's nothing for them to eat
B	I know they know that they just sit and look around don't they like?
A	they do don't they? they seem to do that a lot of the day just sit around
B	yeah they're nice little things rabbits I suppose
A	mm
B	you ever cook rabbit then?
A	no never cook them
B	oh oh well
A	cooked pheasant before
B	well there's not much flesh of course on on rabbits or or
A	they're full of bones rabbits
B	yeah mainly bones
A	I think the best way to cook them is in a pie
B	oh
A	cos then the meat will fall off the bone
B	oh you wouldn't waste any then no no
A	otherwise you've got to get it all off
B	no
A	if you grill it all put yes it's a pain actually cos it's full of bones so really you want it to fall off yes rabbit pie is nice I like that
B	do you like pheasants and that also?
A	I love pheasant yeah
B	there's I used to have a
A	oh right
B	always gave me a pair of them always not just one always two
A	oh yes
B	and grandma
A	yes used to have to peel
B	yeah for a long time yeah
A	mm
B	until grandma said I can't stand the smell any more so
A	oh right
A	yeah do you have to disembowel them when you hang them or do you hang them whole?
A	cos otherwise the the innards actually infect you know taint the meat
B	need to take it away do you?
A	you have to hang them like by a hoof and then you slit down the middle and pull everything out and then you leave it to mature
B	I I think that's what we used to do there
A	oh right so maybe you have to do that with birds as well
A	cos yes that's what makes fish go off it's the guts isn't it? that's when it rots it rots from the gut
B	yeah that's right
A	oh right oh that's pretty good
A	oh that's right nothing can get in
A	yes
B	mm mm
A	yeah all those things quail
B	I yeah
A	pheasant
B	I don't think
A	no nor
B	yeah
A	I always think if you're going to eat meat and you're worried about the ethical side
B	yeah
A	or even the health side then actually game is a very ethical meat to eat because it's not being kept cooped up
B	yeah
A	it's lived wild all its life and it doesn't have much fat on it unlike
B	oh
A	say pork or something so if you want to
B	yes cos you don't get it's not fatty on game no no no no
A	it's not fatty cos it's just it's a lean meat yes yes it's probably quite healthy for you and of course not full of chemicals cos it's a wild animal
B	did I tell you? I was
A	yeah I wouldn't mind actually going
B	oh shooting?
A	learning to shoot yeah
B	yeah
A	you feel a bit sad but at the same time if you're going to eat meat well you should know where it comes from really
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	do you think you're pretty good with a rifle would you?
A	no I'm not good I have shot them before I'm not good at all actually so yes
B	no no
A	that'll put me off
B	I know when we little
A	oh right
B	we're not we we only shoot at targets we don't shoot at
A	oh oh that's good
B	yeah fix him up some targets in the yard there
A	yes
B	take the steps out put the rest of the gun on for him and then he peppers away
A	oh that's good oh yeah expect he enjoys that
B	yeah he does as well
A	yes
B	can you shoot straight?
A	no I'm
B	no
A	I went to a fantastic rifle range in Abu Dhabi cos they're more into their guns
B	right
A	it was really professional it was underground all soundproofed
B	oh
A	a catalogue full of guns and you have to choose which gun you want hundreds in there so I thought I don't know so I asked the man I thought well he knows doesn't he? I said I want erm a small gun without much recoil cos I've shot those big rifles before
B	nearly break your arm yeah
A	and I had a bruise
B	oh no if you've gotta have
A	yeah it was too heavy for me the whole thing was too heavy so I said I want something small without much recoil
B	no
A	and erm yes he said oh you need erm a Glock that's what they have in all the films it's very light and there's not much recoil so a lot of women like these
B	yeah
A	and then they gave you all the training without the bullets obviously so they teach you how to stand how to hold it
B	no no it's
A	not supposed to turn around
B	no
A	yes how how to load the bullets that sort of thing so they show you all of that and then you go down to the range and they've got those moving targets you know?
B	oh yes
A	a proper you know gun range so at first they put it about twenty-five metres away or something
B	they're moving targets? oh wow
A	er you know it's a sort of it was just erm the ones with circles and
B	I'd forgotten those targets we used to have them I know
A	yeah yeah and you have to aim
B	yeah yeah
A	erm of course cos you close one eye
B	yeah
A	actually that throws your eye off doesn't it?
B	it does yeah
A	it's quite interesting they made us practise actually without a gun and they said you know look at your finger with both eyes now close one eye and say what happens to your finger so if I close my right eye it actually makes my finger look like it's moved to the left
B	moved yeah yeah
A	so he said you've got to counteract for that with the gun because you're thinking
B	yeah
A	things are further to the left when they really are cos you've closed one eye so you've actually got to aim slightly more to the right than you think
B	yes yeah
A	and also when you shoot a gun the barrel comes up as you shoot as you pull the trigger the
B	mm
A	so it's quite interesting there's quite a lot of like calculation cos you've got to aim
B	mm
A	I was terrible at it
B	no I was never good at rifle shooting
A	no no I wasn't good at all
B	yeah
A	no I wouldn't want to have to do that in real life
B	mm no no no my my dad was an excellent shot
A	oh right
B	well he of course he was erm nineteen fourteen eighteen war one that
A	oh yes
B	and the the only thing they had was rifles I suppose
A	yes
B	and he was a pretty good shot and in fact if he went to the fairground he could always come with the prize
A	oh that's good
B	and they
A	mm that's right yeah they did didn't they? yeah I don't know if they do any more
A	yeah yeah I've never done it but erm yeah I know they do have those
B	I know I think they I think my dad got them in er and er
A	oh right
B	and he he left one behind he thought he couldn't take all three away so he left them one just two
A	oh
B	I've forgotten I've forgotten what they gave him but he was a pretty good shot
B	and I was the world's worst with rifles
B	going like this no no
A	dear
C	good
B	mm
C	no too much at lunchtime
B	oh you're you're a very light eater anyhow aren't you?
B	what did you have?
C	oh it was a cold fish platter
B	oh
C	and it was very generous with the fish and it came with potatoes and salad
B	oh sea bass I bet
A	oh mm
C	and I'd've been fine with just a Greek salad
A	yeah
C	but it it was lovely though
B	lovely
A	yeah
C	and
B	oh yes he had quite a big variety of stuff didn't he?
C	huge amount of fish in there
B	yeah
A	oh right oh
B	course you would expect that in
A	well that's true yeah so where was this you went?
C	fabulous
B	yeah
C	it's called the
A	oh right mm
C	it's got a very good write-up on Tripadvisor I've been before
A	yeah
C	it was excellent
A	oh
B	it was good that
A	oh right
B	oh going down yeah
A	oh I don't know
B	yeah
A	so
C	at the top end keep driving up on the left it's called
B	there seemed a lot of little fish shops on that road wasn't there?
A	oh
C	yes there are
B	that you know selling fish and
A	oh
B	and
A	mm
C	and that's actually very interesting I mean the
A	yes
B	yeah
A	yes
C	if you walk from the
A	oh right
B	yeah you almost think you're in the ancient times there don't you?
A	wow
C	really nice
B	cobbled streets
A	that is nice
B	you've got a lot to learn since you came back
A	well yes and that's why I wanted to be in this walking group actually cos there's so much to see in
A	it's tomorrow
B	oh tomorrow?
B	walking yes walking
A	have you done that walk? you must've done bits
C	no but I know where you are
A	yes
B	yes
A	yeah it'll be lovely at this time of year cos the bluebells are out aren't they?
B	oh there's loads of bluebells everywhere
A	loads this year yeah
B	we've got loads in the garden down on
A	yeah no it's a good year for them
B	well
A	mm
B	cos your grandma I mean years went during the
A	oh right yeah
B	there must be woods around with with
A	yeah I expect down there actually on the river on there'll be a lot
B	mm okay yeah
A	yeah lovely
A	yes and all the wild garlic
C	yeah
A	that's out now that's beautiful they put that on my mushrooms today the wild garlic flowers
C	did you?
B	yeah
A	yeah they did
C	nice
A	yeah it's nice that it's coming in a bit more
B	yeah
A	like using you know
B	yeah
A	what's in season
B	you like mushrooms do you?
A	oh garlic mushrooms I love oh yes yeah
B	oh I think I like mushrooms do you like mushrooms
C	I do I I think the little ones are have no flavour like the big flat real mushrooms
A	mm yes
B	oh the big flat? yes yes
A	the little ones have a great texture if you leave them whole
B	yes
A	yes they do
B	but they're they're much dearer aren't they the little ones? aren't they or are they they more expensive?
A	usually are yes
B	cos well I thought those big flat ones usually
A	yes
B	cos they look as they're going off sometimes the big flat ones
A	yeah they're not yes they're not always very good in the supermarket
B	no
A	cos they're not very fresh I think are they?
B	no
C	you need to get them from a farm shop
A	yes yeah I was reading about growing your own oyster mushrooms the other day it's a bit of a long-term project though it takes at least a year to get your first harvest
A	it's easy apparently well firstly you need to get the right kind of logs and they like oak so you you're supposed to go and buy green oak you know as in newly cut because you don't want older wood cos then it'll already be infected with various fungi anyway and then on mine like off Amazon you can buy you know those dowel pins you get like on
C	mm
A	sort of tables and
B	yeah
A	you know cheap furniture they have the the slot together with those so you buy those off the internet but you can get ones that have been erm I don't know what they call it sort of impregnated with spores from the oyster mushroom or whatever
B	mm
A	tree mushroom it is you're after and what you do is you get a drill and you drill into the the wood and then you insert these dowel
A	like pins into it
B	mm
A	erm and that's it you just like leave it for a year outside and off they come or in your garage whatever
C	are you going to try?
A	I might do it as a project this autumn actually
C	yeah
B	yeah yeah
A	if I
C	I like
A	yeah it's quiet common in Japan or China people do grow mushrooms but in the UK it's quite unusual it's quite hard to grow other sorts of mushrooms
C	yes they're a bit specialised aren't they those?
A	it's a quite a specialised thing and
B	yes
A	if it gets infected with another soil you have to throw the whole lot away so it's not simple at all
B	no I know we used to act for some people who used to do mushrooms
A	that's right yeah you you had that mushroom farm client
B	and they er they used to erm spray them quite often like
A	ah right yes apparently it's very complicated to grow
B	yes yes
A	one sort of mushroom
B	that's right
A	in you know that medium because of the infectation
B	yeah you get one's like that and then the other one's like that
A	yeah you basically have to to work in a clean room
B	yeah
A	to start them off a sterile room with all the gear and everything it's
B	yeah
A	yeah it's things just infect it otherwise it makes sense doesn't it? cos we know like mould grows even in fridges
C	yeah
A	even if you leave you know even if you put something in a fridge and you put bleach in there and you leave it a bit too long it will still grow
A	that's right so it's there already
B	well those big mushroom I think it's better flavour than the little ones
A	yeah yeah that's right yes
B	are you a mushroom fan dear?
C	I love them yeah
B	no there you are
A	wild er you know like the big ones you get in the shop but wild ones are those but you
B	yeah the big ones
A	I wouldn't eat them myself without an expert but I happened to be at a country park where they had a mushroom expert in the visitor centre
A	so and they'd
A	absolutely fantastic
A	they were so fresh
B	yeah
A	so meaty
C	nice
A	yeah I wouldn't be able to find them myself like cos they look like other mushrooms apparently that are very very poisonous
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	oh
A	and it's almost impossible to tell them apart unless you're an expert so it's not something you'd want to mess with
B	there's quite a lot of different sorts of mushrooms aren't there?
A	hundreds and thousands in the UK
B	yeah that's right I know yeah different sorts
A	yes apparently the vast majority are edible but the problem is if you get it wrong you're in big trouble and they all look very similar so it's not something
B	no
A	you want to do
B	no
A	the other thing is the majority are very very small in the UK
B	oh yeah no yeah
A	like most it's not those big field mushrooms they're tiny things
B	there's some of them get as big as plates don't you?
A	yeah oh yes
B	you know what I mean?
A	yeah actually in Spain they have this one called the cauliflower mushroom and they sell that in the supermarket in Japan and it looks just like a brain or a cauliflower if you want to be diplomatic but it looks like a brain and you slice it and fry it lightly like with tempura or something it's just incredibly light it's lovely yeah cos in Japan you go to the supermarket and they'll have six or seven different sorts in every supermarket
B	yeah
A	whereas the UK's very odd like that
C	really?
A	you're lucky if you get two sorts aren't you?
C	you and you have to look for them and half the time you want them for a recipe and they haven't got them
A	that's right yeah
B	no they they don't have
A	no
B	mushrooms?
A	it's never caught on here
C	well they they have the old ordinary ones
B	oh do they?
C	yeah but
[ANNOTATION]	Some people have always a recipe when asked for one.	Contradiction
B	what? in the vegetable section I suppose?
C	yes
A	yes
B	yeah
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	There is cauliflower in the vegetable part.	Neutral
C	but if you want specialised mushrooms they're much harder to come by
B	oh you
A	see if you go to Italy then they'll have all sorts in the shops because
B	oh yes
A	they just eat a wider range
B	oh yes
A	but here we only ever eat one it seems
[ANNOTATION]	It's hard to find rare mushrooms in Italy.	Contradiction
B	yes
A	the button one and it's the same one which is
B	yeah
A	the bigger one isn't it? they just let it grow
B	no
A	so it's one type yes
B	I used to come home with boxes of mushrooms
A	oh that's right
B	she got fed up with them
B	oh yes you got
C	with metal handles
B	oh that's right yes
C	I remember it
[ANNOTATION]	Someone was exasperated with all those mushrooms.	Entailment
A	mm
B	used to always give me some of those to bring home
C	oh that's nice yeah
B	yeah I don't think I don't think your mum liked mushrooms that was the answer
C	she wasn't very keen I think
B	no no no
[ANNOTATION]	Someone's mother was not really fond of mushrooms.	Entailment
A	that's funny mushroom soup's nice
C	yes it is
A	delicious
B	oh mushroom soup's lovely
A	yeah
B	I think I've got some in the cupboard have I?
[ANNOTATION]	No speaker likes mushroom soup.	Contradiction
A	I expect so
C	I usually buy you a
B	mm
C	it's your favourite isn't it? the Baxter's
A	yes
B	what darling?
C	Baxter's
B	oh Baxter's?
C	cream of mushroom
B	oh yes I think
A	ah
C	no I don't buy tinned soups
A	no I make it
C	I make my own
A	yeah I make soup I try and do it
A	I probably get it make it every other week but just Saturday morning I'll put some on
B	is it a long job? no just
A	no well the preparation's easy and then yes you just have to turn it right down and leave it it depends what you're making but vegetable soups take about half an hour to forty minutes to just simmer gently
B	yes I tend to forget what I've put on so
C	smell it burning
B	and there there's no moisture in the pot
A	yeah dear
B	I gave up on those things no no
A	that's no good
B	no no
C	I have a lovely one I don't know if you've ever tried it is roasted tomatoes
A	oh that sounds nice
C	with garlic
A	oh
C	you have to peel the tomatoes that's the bad
A	yes that's pain
C	you put them in the oven with chopped up garlic and olive oil
A	mm
C	when they're roasted when they're done you process them
A	yeah
C	and then put it in a saucepan
A	mm
C	and you add blue cheese
A	oh wow that sounds nice
B	yeah
A	mm sounds lovely
C	because it tastes nothing like your manufactured tomato soup
A	no
C	it's completely different
A	well I think all homemade soups just taste so different to the shop ones
C	they're lovely aren't they?
A	but yeah Baxter's ones aren't bad though
B	yeah some you buy in the shops are awful aren't they? some of them like
C	no they're probably the best
A	some of them are awful yeah absolutely dreadful like those spring vegetable you get half the time taste of water
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	just boiled vegetables
A	just tasteless
C	I think your Baxter's are amongst the better tinned soups
A	mm
B	Baxter yeah yeah
B	got their own do they?
A	mm
C	yes you buy them in those little containers
B	oh jars don't they? yeah think
C	fresh freshly made soup
C	yeah
A	mm
C	and they're not bad
A	no
C	but you do need to use them within a certain length of time otherwise they go off a bit
B	you have lots of mushroom soup at home do you?
A	I haven't made it for a long time but actually I should
B	yeah yeah
A	because the supermarket often marks down mushrooms cos they don't keep that long and they're really cheap you probably only need a punnet don't you? get a couple of punnets maybe
B	cos they don't look very nice when they're going off mushrooms do they?
A	no no the big ones
B	put you off
A	don't look very nice
C	and you like the French onion soup don't you?
A	oh I like that
B	yeah well I buy that quite often
A	I make that quite yeah I made that for mum and dad the other day yeah
B	do you? yeah it's a nice one that
A	I love that yeah such a cheap soup to make as well you only need a handful of onions
A	that's about it bit of wine
B	it's nice
A	yeah yeah I like that yeah
C	very good those very nice
B	oh
C	yeah
B	I
A	yeah and I made cheddar cheese soup the other day that's
B	oh
A	yeah
C	don't know that one
B	oh of course she
A	yeah so she makes that with celery
B	I thought
A	and a carrot no onion really really nice
C	I've done the yeah I've done celery and Stilton cheese
A	oh yes
C	yeah
A	yes so this is cheddar
C	yeah oh right
A	really lovely colour bright bright yellow and really thick delicious
B	yeah
A	yeah should ask her for the recipe
C	I will
A	yeah mum's got it as well though obviously
B	you better you two better put your heads together write a book on soups
C	yeah
A	yes yeah
C	I love them
A	yeah I think they're fantastic
B	you eat
C	yeah but only if I make them myself or or somebody else does and
A	mm
B	and
A	oh yes yeah
B	yeah course she doesn't eat meat does she
C	no
A	chicken occasionally
B	no oh does she? oh
A	or
C	no she stopped that
A	I might not oh has she? oh
C	she'll eat fish
B	yeah
A	ah right okay yeah
B	still
A	no
B	no
A	well that's good cos you've got to make your own mind up haven't you?
A	so that's right yeah
B	but I think
A	oh
B	he doesn't want beef he just wants chicken
C	I know
B	yeah
C	he still asks for the children's menus sometimes
A	ah
C	very limited isn't he really I think what he likes?
A	yeah well it might come later cos
C	I hope so
A	was a very fussy eater when she was young
C	was she?
A	absolutely awful like wouldn't eat anything and even when she came as an adult to Japan to see me she wouldn't eat anything she just ate honestly plain rice for the entire week she was out there she wouldn't even try the other food like they didn't the town I lived didn't even have Mcdonald's I mean she was really stuck breakfast is okay you can always get bread
C	yeah
A	and things but evening meal but it was only in her late twenties that she started to sort of eat more widely and now she'll eat yeah loads of things quinoa and all sorts
C	wow
B	oh
A	all sorts of vegetables
B	does she?
A	buckwheat yeah
B	does she? oh
A	I said that's a bit of change said yeah
B	oh that's good with
A	yeah it's funny but she said yeah it was awkward cos you go to people's house and they would've cooked for her and you know she wouldn't like that she wouldn't like that she had to eat it
B	no
A	actually she quite liked it
B	oh
A	but your taste buds change as you get older
B	I was yeah yeah
A	definitely yeah
B	mm
A	like when I was young you know those bell peppers you get the?
B	I don't like peppers
A	so they're not hot the bell peppers
B	oh no
A	but I was convinced as a child they were spicy I tasted them as spicy and if you think about it's the same family as
C	mm
A	chilli peppers even though they don't taste hot to adults to a child you must be picking up on a the same chemical
C	mm
A	so I wouldn't eat them for years and now I I taste them raw or cooked and I can't believe I thought they were spicy
C	no they're very mild aren't they?
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	the red ones are quite sweet
B	do you eat peppers then
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	oh
C	yeah
B	don't think I've ever eaten peppers never liked peppers
C	mm
B	course I don't know what I am eating sometimes
C	no I I think as
B	they're not no
A	no those aren't no
B	no
C	if you ate a chilli pepper
B	oh that'd put me right off
A	you would know
C	you would know about it
B	when we're going to
A	that's right yes
B	in the summer
A	yeah
B	the Middle East is a bit like that isn't it?
A	erm they have a lot of Indian food
B	yeah
A	because it's Indian chefs usually
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	but the locals don't really like spicy food they use particular spices but they're not the hot ones so they
B	yeah
A	would use a lot of cardamom and cinnamon and cumin in their cooking
B	oh yes
A	but it's not the sort of chilli pepper
B	no
A	yeah
B	you had a lot of Indian people in Bahrain didn't you
C	oh they're all around the Gulf
A	mm
C	they're everywhere
B	well I thought when I remember going over there
A	yeah
B	oh well they're probably eating all their chillies whatever they have
A	yes they eat very spicy food
C	yeah
C	yes
B	no no
A	no good for you
B	when we went to India I must say
B	yeah do you like Indian food
C	yes I do
B	oh
C	mm
B	and
C	yeah
B	oh well he used to
C	we eat I suspect like
A	yes
B	yeah
C	and if you're travelling you always try don't you what they
A	yeah that's right
C	what they eat there
B	yes while you're there
A	yes I'm trying at the moment to go back a bit more to the way I was as a teenager and not eat battery farmed chicken or pork because it's not ethical you
A	so I'm gonna keep with beef and lamb er cos that's you know out in the fields and if I buy pork or chicken make sure it's free ranged it'd be a cheap you know a special treat or look when it's marked down in the supermarket which is quite a lot but yeah it's not not right and chicken is incredibly cheap in the supermarkets at the moment and you think well
B	oh yeah it's cheap yeah mm
A	that's why
B	yeah
A	this chicken has never seen the light of day
B	no that's right they don't no
A	literally been in a cage all its life
B	they they've been caged in somewhere aren't they? yeah
A	yeah I never
B	no no
A	so I've always bought free range and they're not expensive
B	yeah
A	but chicken yeah over the years just ignored it
C	yes
A	oh right yes
B	yeah
A	they're not very expensive to be honest they're only about
B	no no
C	I always buy free range
B	beg your pardon?
A	yeah
C	the taste is much better
A	it's much better taste
B	oh yes oh there's no no comparison really
A	yes
B	yes
A	buying it and I should really just buy locally from the farms cos they all sell eggs round by me
B	mm
A	they're selling rhubarb now on the farms next to me
B	oh are they? oh
A	they got their first crop
B	oh it's your one of your favourites rhubarb
A	yes yeah I love rhubarb yes
B	yeah I thought so are you a rhubarb fan
C	no in fact I've just dug it up from the garden
A	oh no
B	oh
A	ah
C	I don't mind it but I mean what do you eat it with?
A	rhubarb crumble
C	but you put loads of sugar in
A	it's lovely
A	I made it for grandpa the other day
B	yeah I know it's a very nice flavour
A	we ate six portions between us
A	in a sitting after a main course
C	oh my goodness
B	yeah I like rhubarb pies
B	did I have some today?
B	I always tend to yeah if somebody made
C	you had apple pie today
B	beg your pardon?
C	you had apple pie today
B	oh apple pie was it? well I like apple pie anyhow yes brambly apple pies
A	yes yeah that's nice
B	yeah oh yes
C	well
A	ah
C	really?
A	determined to have some
B	what have you planted then?
A	one rhubarb plant
B	oh one rhubarb have you?
A	yes
B	oh that's nice
A	yeah gonna have some next year or maybe even later this year if I'm lucky
A	that's right yeah
C	yeah
B	go about this high
A	yeah it's quite a productive plant actually
B	I know yes you can get one of those big ones
A	yeah
B	only need about two sticks and you've got a good meal haven't you?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	that's right yes that's right you won't need much to make a good meal a couple of sticks you're fine
B	oh no no not those big ones no
A	couple of sticks you're fine
B	are you are you not a rhubarb fan then
C	I I don't mind it but I can't
A	yeah it's it's a bit erm surprising when you see how much goes in
B	oh I don't know you put a lot of sugar in rhubarb do they?
C	I don't use sugar in
A	yeah it's not edible if you
B	oh I had forgotten yes
C	so I don't use sugar in cooking
B	oh
A	I read somewhere though and I've never tried it there's a herb called chervil
A	and if you put that in with the rhubarb you can put in a fraction of the sugar cos for some reason it makes you think it's sweeter than it really is
C	that's interesting
A	yeah yeah you could probably I'll google it now but I'm sure it was chervil but you can't buy chervil you'd have to grow your own
C	yeah
C	I could try growing it
A	limited after yeah yes
C	I've got a herb bed in the garden
B	yeah
A	chervil
B	and always around Morrisons they have a huge range of fruit don't they?
C	yeah
B	in Morrisons vegetables as well
C	yes they're good
B	all sorts of things over there
C	I'm going to try and start like start using farm shops a bit more
A	yeah I'd like to buy locally a lot more
C	cos I think it's important
B	there's there's a there's some near
C	oh they're all over the place
A	there's a lot round by me
B	oh are they?
A	very small scale
B	oh
C	yes
B	oh they are really?
C	yeah they don't many of them don't carry a huge range but you know you can get some key things there and I think it's important to support them
B	yes I
A	I do
B	yes
A	and that's what we should be doing with food buying much more locally
C	yeah
C	yeah
A	mm
C	er but as you say buying the eggs and it doesn't matter if you get one big and one small in a pack cos everything's so uniform in supermarkets
B	yeah yeah
C	yeah
B	not like Morrisons big ones they're just local stuff
A	mm
B	think they put them up local eggs yes
A	yes local eggs bit more expensive than the supermarket I've noticed but then they're probably very fresh
B	is it really? oh yes
C	yes they would be
B	yeah
C	and a lot of people will you know put the stalls out on the roadside and it's just an honesty box around where we are
A	yeah it is round by me
B	oh is it? oh yeah
A	yeah
B	we used to put stuff out when we lived in
C	yeah the posies and
B	oh
C	mm
B	she did for charity
A	mm try and find it
B	oh what you got on there then
A	oh I was thinking about I'm sure I read somewhere about chervil this herb called chervil
B	oh chervil?
A	being used to reduce the amount of sugar
B	oh you use it put it in with rhubarb
A	you cook with fruit enormously
B	yeah yeah
A	but erm yeah I'm
B	I didn't know you put sugar in with fruit do you? no
A	yeah you usually with like cooking apples as well but
B	do you?
A	rhubarb you put an awful lot of sugar in
B	oh
A	agave syrup it suggests
B	why's you can eat an apple okay and then
A	different sort of apple cos those
B	oh I see
A	cooking apples are are very tart
B	oh yeah very I suppose they're
A	yeah yes with a sweet apple you wouldn't need to add sugar
B	oh
A	oh right
B	yeah where did you where did you have your vegetable? you had a vegetable garden
C	on just herbs
B	just herbs was it?
C	yes
B	there we are
C	yeah I've got herbs again
B	oh you're into the herb families are you?
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	I'm looking up the same as
B	oh
A	yeah I'm trying to find it can't find it now says it chervil was a favourite of the Romans its use dates back in kitchens to the fifteenth century
B	oh I like parsley I think it's a lovely little lovely one to
A	yeah mm yes
B	I never turn parsley away
A	yeah very English
B	what don't I like in those things? er
A	do you like rosemary?
B	no I don't care for those things
A	no I don't like rosemary actually cos that always
C	oh I do
A	yeah I mean that's what you're supposed to put with lamb
B	oh you you like rosemary do you?
A	but erm
B	no no
A	I don't really like it
B	no
C	I thought we had some here
B	rosemary?
C	yeah I'm sure mum told me there was some growing here once but
A	yes there is round the side I don't know if it's still there
C	is it still there?
B	oh oh I used to have a
C	mm
A	you've still got those currant bushes they're still growing
B	are they?'
A	yeah they're fine yeah
B	have to go and have a have a look yeah
A	tiny garden
B	tiny one oh
A	it's not very big
B	well you don't want too much do you at the moment?
A	no unless it's sweet cicely maybe I've muddled it up there's something called sweet cicely that's coming up as a sugar substitute let me try that maybe I've muddled them up in my mind
B	oh
A	don't know how you say that name C I C E L Y?
A	could be cicely it's oh yes it is it's that one it says it says
C	well there you go then
B	oh
A	that's what it is
B	oh yes
A	because you can't grow it in this country and actually
B	no no
A	I was talking to erm you know I work on that community farm near me
B	ah yes
A	and they were saying sugar beet is new it's basically something the seed companies cooked up
B	oh yeah
A	around the time of the Second World War because they were so worried about sugar cane being limited at the time we used to import
B	yeah
A	all our sugar and it was all sugar cane which only grows in places like Jamaica and very tropical countries
B	yeah yeah
A	so they invented sugar beet by breeding you know basically the swede family together which contains a lot of sugar and they came up with this plant and it's all patented you can't
C	really?
A	buy sugar beet unless you're a sugar beet farmer
B	oh
A	yeah and they grow it in East Anglia everywhere sugar beet everywhere
B	does it is it as sweet like all these sugars?
A	you have to process it
B	oh I see yes
A	erm so what we get in this country is mostly sugar beet now
B	be sugar beet yeah
A	er but yeah you can only grow it under licence?
B	oh
A	and yeah it's quite a process to extract it it's not easy they have to put it in these low pressure cookers and that extracts the sugar somehow with water don't
B	oh
A	boils at a very funny temperature very low temperature I suppose
B	oh
A	mm you find it?
C	yes I have
A	yeah that's what you want to says it's easy to grow outside with minimal care
B	oh
A	that's what you need
B	have you planted stuff already in your garden?
A	very little actually
B	no no no no
A	yeah I've done the lawn that was priorities
A	yes I thought that will make a big difference and the trouble is if you don't get it in now then all the weeds grow so then you spend the rest of the summer
B	oh I see that yes
A	pulling the weeds out so
B	yeah
A	and I had to dig the whole garden over to get the builders' rubble out so that took me two weeks
B	oh
A	full of rubble
C	yeah
A	enormous pieces
C	terrible mess
B	yeah
A	such a
B	yeah
A	two centimetres of topsoil on top nothing would grow in that
C	yes
A	so I've got the turf in so that's most of the garden and they put a fruit tree in that was on the plans but they didn't give it to me
B	oh
A	so I wrote them an email and said where is the fruit tree on my plans? your window for planting closes in two weeks and they erm by the time I got back from work it was in
C	really?
B	yeah
B	yeah well done yeah
A	and the good thing was they gave me a greengage tree
B	oh I like greengages yes
A	that's exciting cos you don't ever see greengage season's so short in the UK
A	blink and you miss it
B	yeah
A	I like greengages
C	don't think I've ever eaten them
A	yeah they're
B	no
C	that'll be nice then
A	yes that's quite an old fashioned thing isn't it?
B	it is I suppose yes
A	my other grandma grandma
B	no
A	must've had a tree I suppose
C	yeah
B	yeah and if you haven't picked them up they're still going off in no time
B	have you actually you don't have a garden it's cos you've got a flat isn't it?
C	where is it?
B	where in
C	it's a house not a flat
B	oh it's a oh I'm
C	no we've got a garden
B	did you have a flat in one time?
C	no
B	oh well why why why I said you had a flat?
C	we moved to
B	oh I I thought you've got a flat somewhere I don't know
B	oh well
C	oh yeah we've got
B	you've always had a garden then?
C	yeah
B	oh
A	have you used erm Stevia as a sugar substitute?
C	no
A	that you can get in the shops now erm like Waitrose sell it and it's twice as sweet at least as sugar so you halve the recipe
C	yeah
A	erm yeah very very sweet but yeah some people say it's got er a bit of a flavour so now like the big companies like Tate and Lyle are mixing it with sugar but it's still half you don't have to
C	mm
A	that's quite good it's a plant just some natural plant
C	right
A	and I've got agave as well I haven't tried that agave syrup? from a cactus
C	oh goodness
A	cos sugar's out
B	oh
C	yes
A	yes
B	do can you get recipes on there
C	oh yes
B	oh that's useful then
C	yeah
A	yes so this is from the Independent it says sweet cicely can be used as a sugar substitute the seeds and dried leaves can be added to fruit pies and crumbles while the flowers and even the roots are also good for salads or cooking gentle aniseed flavour
C	you'd have to start growing some of these things
A	yes
B	yeah
A	there's a lot of herbs actually which are really traditional in the UK that you cannot buy lemon balm for tea I love that have you had that?
C	no
A	absolutely delicious grandma used to grow it here by the swimming pool and she gave me some once
B	mm oh of course we used to have some up there
A	yes yeah
B	yeah of course I forgot we had it
A	grandma was quite a gardener wasn't she? she was always out in the garden
B	yeah playing around with gardens yes
A	yeah cos I remember I was doing a herb garden once and I asked her if she had anything
B	yeah yes yeah
A	she got me some apple mint from the garden and yeah lemon balm and rosemary
B	yeah
A	and they all grew they all took yeah
C	so were they growing here these things and?
A	yes yeah she had I don't know if they're still here I know they were up by the pool and the rosemary was just tucked around the corner I don't know if it's still there
A	it's quite a big plant so it probably is
B	yeah
A	yeah I love herbs though
B	yeah
A	yeah I think they're amazing
B	course grandma her her father was always growing stuff
C	yeah
B	he was good at
C	I remember his garden the back of that bungalow
B	oh it was went over the bungalow yeah he used to have lovely gardens yeah
C	mm
A	mm
B	excellent gardener at flowers and other things as well besides the flowers yeah
A	ah
B	have you got have you got flowers in yours?
C	no
A	not yet I've just put some wild flower seeds under the greengage tree
B	oh
A	so that's right at the back so I thought I could let the grass grow up amongst the flowers so it would look like it's sort of going into a sort of cottage effect it's only a tiny garden but I do my bit for the bees
B	what's your? what have you got then?
A	erm so I planted
B	yeah yeah
A	ox eyed daisies
B	yeah yeah oh daisies
A	those big
B	yeah
A	you know the big showy ones you sometimes see on grass verges here
B	oh yes
A	I'm not sure what else was in that mix poppies cornflour
B	oh
A	viper's bugloss which is that beautiful purple one that grows on a spike it's only about that high
B	oh yeah
A	er but that's the
A	that's about it all sort of things grow at home thought it'd be nice
B	yes lovely
A	yeah
B	grandma used to make a lot of daisy chains when she was younger do you remember those?
A	that's right yeah
C	yeah
B	have you ever made daisy chains?
A	yeah I think she taught me actually

C	it's a huge garden there
B	oh always big wasn't it?

B	yeah I remember that garden yeah you had a big one
C	yeah
B	oh that was a big garden yeah
A	mm
B	how do you keep that garden? did you have someone coming in did you?
C	no I we did most of it
B	oh well
B	who did the digging then?
C	you're
A	mm
B	yeah
C	don't want to be doing that all the time
B	oh
A	no
B	oh I'd forgotten you were a gardener dear I thought you were rather
C	well I wasn't really I was a forced gardener
B	oh
B	not by choice eh it's it's oh
C	necessity I mean when you look at it you know in summer I mean the pictures were beautiful of our garden so think oh it's worth it but
B	yes
C	it's hard work
B	cos
C	no he's not very interested
B	he used to like
C	no he wouldn't do hedges oh no that's that's true somebody did the hedges
B	did did they? yeah I've forgotten
C	you needed scaffolding for one along the road
B	oh
A	madness
C	this tall
C	well no scaffolding's a joke it was a
B	yeah
C	like a builder's
A	oh okay yeah
C	a what do you call it?
A	don't know I know what you mean
B	oh
C	decorators stand on these things sometimes
A	yes yeah
C	it's need a platform
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	and the one across the field at the back erm the farm used to do it with one of those machines for hedge cutting cos it's it was filled with er thorns and that in it
B	oh cos it you would
A	mm
B	was that gardener here today? yesterday our gardener?
C	yes he was here yesterday dad
B	what's what's he doing I had no?
C	erm he's been out by the pool
B	oh yes?
C	he's cleared a path along the side he's
B	yes
C	cut back right back towards the
B	oh
C	he's done heaps here
B	oh must go and
A	mm
B	yeah
C	yes
B	yeah they go crashing
C	yes
B	every time you see them come racing over you pat him on the back and his tail starts wagging
B	yeah yes
B	are you a
A	I like dogs yeah I do like them
B	oh yeah
A	if they're well behaved
B	oh oh it was
A	yeah and mum
B	well at least
A	mm
C	well he had to didn't he in the end?
A	that's right yeah
B	oh yes he did have him but er I was
A	that's funny cos mum's scared of dogs now she's terrified of them
B	is she? yeah
A	if she sees a dog off the lead when she's on a walk she won't carry on the walk she'll go back
B	oh she's changed then really she used to
C	really?
A	yeah yeah that was
B	yeah
A	quite difficult in the country where they are
B	oh oh
C	what? even if she sees the owner coming?
A	yeah she won't stay there
C	won't go then?
A	or she tells them she tells them to put it call it back
B	oh
A	pretty scared of them mm
C	has she actually been bitten?
A	no she hasn't but she said when
C	is she?
A	yeah but that's transference isn't it? feeling cos she would've been too young to remember that
B	oh
A	yeah yeah
B	I know when
A	oh
B	and poor old
C	yeah
B	frightened the life out of him thought he was about to be eaten up I think
A	yeah
B	yeah but you never quite know with dogs they might be jealous mightn't they?
A	that's right yeah especially if you're in their you know on their patch
C	yeah yeah
B	yeah yeah I think yeah yeah I think so yeah
A	might well be
B	yeah cos our dog that mum used to have that my mother used to have and er even if I hadn't been home for months I'd been away a couple of years he still knew you when you come back it's amazing I think
A	oh that's nice yeah they remember don't they?
B	yeah
A	mm
B	one man and his dog
A	yeah
B	you know what one
C	mm yeah
B	yeah
B	well you haven't had dogs
C	no I it's too much of a commitment
B	er well it is a commitment to have a dog isn't it?
A	it is yeah
B	yeah yeah you haven't got them either?
A	no not in a new house I think that's
B	mm oh no
A	not what you want
B	take a lot of looking
A	yeah all the fur yeah make a right mess
B	yeah and of course if you're at home you've gotta keep them locked up I suppose yes
A	yes and you want a big garden really don't you with a dog?
B	yes yes
A	it's not really fair to keep them inside all the time and then there's the mess
B	I know well I know my in my mother we used to have big dogs and do you know they that dog would know when we're when she was arriving like
A	oh right? oh yeah
B	and then she you know the window was looking out onto a road or a pavement outside
A	yeah
B	whether they could hear the pavement or something I don't know but he start barking and he race race into the front window part put his paws on the ledge
A	yeah
B	and start barking he'll see her coming you know it's extraordinary what a dog can do yeah yeah
C	a sense isn't it? yeah
A	yeah mm
B	what did we have? Airedale I think it was
A	oh right yeah oh they're big yeah
B	big dog yeah
C	yeah
B	a big one yes oh yes
A	they are big dogs are very popular in the UK now though
B	mm? what Airedales are they?
A	something like one in four people have a dog of some sort
B	oh I see yes yes yes
A	yeah which is really high
B	well we've always been a dog country of course I think yeah yeah
A	yeah yeah
B	yeah yeah
A	yeah seems very high
B	you're not doggie interested
C	oh no I love them
B	do you?
C	yeah
B	oh oh well
C	not scared of them at all
B	well no they don't no they don't bite you do they? no not really
A	not if they're well trained
B	what what I know with mum I used to play with
A	ah
B	when we used to get bones from the butcher's shop he'd get them in a mouth and being a youngster of about eighteen years I used to be have a tug of war with this bone he goes
B	you know yeah
B	he did he never bit me though but he he didn't like it no no no
A	bigger dogs seem to be calmer I found yeah
B	oh they are big dogs yeah
A	the bigger the dog the calmer they are it's like
B	oh they are usually calm like yes
A	strange relationship with size I suppose the small ones are insecure aren't they?
B	I suppose yeah
A	so they bark a lot and then they go for your ankles small yeah small dogs I've been bitten by not badly nicked
B	yeah
A	whereas a big dog never never even tried
B	well the queen used to have her corgis hadn't she at one time?
A	that's right yeah corgi's dying out apparently a dying breed
B	are they? oh oh
A	yeah there are no corgis left she's got the last ones
B	oh
A	no one keeps them any more
B	no no so you're not gonna have a dog in your house got enough
A	no not a new house I think they
B	no no no so you don't want a new dog
A	yeah the carpets
B	you've gotta put a kennel and that's a fuss isn't it? yeah
A	yes no I love dogs but not in that size house
B	no no this er no
A	not a new one mm
B	I think we used to keep a house outside a kennel I think far as I remember
A	training them's quite a thing isn't it?
B	never knew how to get in beg your pardon?
C	yeah
B	yeah yeah it's not easy
A	did you train yours?
B	I used to
A	did you train it when it was a puppy?
A	no?
B	someone may've done it but not me
A	someone must've yeah cos you have to toilet train them
B	no no yeah
A	it's like a child isn't it? it's quite a thing and you've got to teach it to walk on a lead cos it's
B	yeah
A	doesn't come natural and not pull and
B	oh yes
A	stay at your heel and stop at the road and
B	yeah
A	yeah a friend of mine had a husky puppy and they are very strong willed and very energetic
B	mm
A	we had to take it to all these dog training classes I went with her really interesting the dog training class cos all the psychology of the dog how the dog thinks and you need to make it do what you want to do but not by brute force
B	yeah
A	you've got to get in its head so they would explain what's going on
B	oh yes
A	and you see the dog thinks it's part of the pack and you're its family and you've got to teach it that you're the alpha dog in the group
B	yeah
A	you are the boss but not through force they didn't want you to do that er so you've got to reinforce that behaviour
B	yeah
A	constantly with a puppy it's just constant
C	exhausting I should think
A	absolutely exhausting
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	yeah and you just teach it one trick at a time and they showed us er like working with a dog and it looks quite brutal cos they have it on a short leash and often with puppies they put them on those erm what they call a choke leash
B	oh yes yeah
C	yeah
A	yeah but they said that was the easiest way to teach them and then
B	oh
A	they just showed us teaching it to walk on the lead and every time it went ahead you pull it back
B	yeah
A	and say heel and all the time again heel heel twenty or thirty times then you're left you know just walk up and down three times then give it a rest and a pet do the whole thing again
B	yeah
A	over and over until it's learnt and don't move on to the next trick until it's got it and all the time you reward it with yeah rewards and things what a job
C	yeah
B	are you not into dogs
C	yeah I like them
B	oh you do like them do you?
C	yeah
B	oh it's was it
A	yeah mum doesn't like them
B	no I see it's

A	they're lovely a lovely photo
B	yeah
B	yes
C	yeah it is nice
A	ah
B	yeah they're very nice
C	that was a nice house
B	what
C	yeah it was a lovely house
B	yeah it was a nice house there you don't know that one do you?
A	no no
B	no no no someone said that it's something like this but it wasn't really
C	no I never saw a similarity really
B	yeah I know it's different altogether isn't it this house? yes
C	yeah yeah
B	oh I think it was what's-the-name used to say that er er
C	I I never understood why she said that at all so
B	no no that's right no it's totally different yeah
B	used to have it linked up to the school we were next to a college
A	oh that's nice
B	yeah it was
A	yeah convenient
B	well yes I think your mum used to like the boys next door
B	yeah yeah
C	that was one of her boyfriends
B	it was once
C	he was the head boy
B	one of the boys head boy yeah
A	oh oh
C	did you know about this?
A	no I didn't know that
C	he was called
A	oh
C	he was the head boy of
A	yeah
B	yes
C	they went out for a while
A	oh funny
B	yes
A	yes
B	oh she went to visit his parents didn't she once?
C	I think so and he got in touch with her again didn't he? on er
B	oh
C	Friends Reunited so
A	oh right oh
B	oh yes
A	being nosey
B	we'll have to be careful what we say I don't I do remember that though no
A	it's funny yeah
B	yeah I know yeah
A	that's funny cos my first boyfriend was also a head boy
B	oh
A	yes yeah I'll have to remind mum
B	runs in the family yes
A	yeah he was the head boy at dad's school
B	at which school?
C	really?
B	oh was he?
A	yeah they didn't get on
B	oh must've been difficult having your dad as headmaster yeah
A	well he wasn't head when I was there
B	oh I see
A	he was deputy head although actually it worked out the same because that school was a split site
B	yes split site yes
A	so he was head of lower school which meant he was the head
B	yeah
A	er so yes it was strange I didn't like it at all I was not happy
B	cos everyone knows your dad's the headmaster
A	exactly yeah everybody knows
B	yeah it's makes the life difficult
A	yeah and the teachers made my life the most difficult actually
A	it was the teachers
B	was it?
A	yeah
B	yeah yeah
A	I mean I think he shouldn't've sent us to his school actually
B	the same school no
A	no I think
B	yeah
A	that was the wrong thing to do
B	yeah that's right
A	because the teachers are scared of being seen as being seen
A	as being seen as being you know softer on you so actually
B	yeah
A	they'd be really really hard
B	hard yeah
A	and I was a really good child so actually it was ridiculous and they would report me for everything and I just think that was very unfair
B	oh
A	erm cos they wouldn't've done that with any other child
B	anyone's child no no
A	yeah no so I didn't like that at all never mind
B	I suppose
A	that's life
B	oh well that's life
A	yes
B	yeah
A	think
B	no no no no
A	and
B	yeah it was
A	yeah
B	cos we saw
A	yeah a few days ago yeah
B	yeah that's right
A	that's right yes I saw
B	yeah
A	yes he's well
B	have you been up to Scotland to see him ever?
A	er in August I went last year
B	oh
A	I went for the festival actually
B	oh the oh the Edinburgh festival was it?
A	yeah I went to the fringe the comedy
B	oh did you?
A	it's good yeah enjoyable
B	oh it's pretty good up there yeah
A	mm you been there? well not to Edinburgh I mean to the festival
C	I don't think I ever went to the festival
A	no you must go
C	I know it sounds a really great experience
B	it's a really big do at Edinburgh festival isn't it?
A	yeah and the good thing is with the comedy
B	yeah
A	it's all on the day tickets people sort of hustling and there's a ticket office if you just want to keep it easy
C	yeah
A	and there's this huge brochure but I mean pretty much you're just gonna close your eyes and pick which is what we did well we thought about the type of comedy we might find funny like do you find political comedy funny? or do you find? and I thought physical comedy is always quite but it's you know a bit like a clown but they're going to do it in a clever way you know with Edinburgh festival it's not just gonna be a clown we went to see one of those two women they were absolutely brilliant
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	really really funny er it was quite
B	oh
C	oh it sounds something that you should do once in a while
A	yes yeah there's lots of good small festivals aren't there?
B	oh
A	and down here as well actually
B	oh
A	music down here and
B	yes
A	apparently
B	oh oh yes they got some music in
C	yeah
A	that would be worth going to cos I could commute from mum and dad's couldn't I?
B	yeah
A	and just stay for the weekend it's only ten miles
A	that's right
C	that'd be interesting yeah
A	I've been to the
C	lovely
B	oh
A	absolutely loved it it's a lovely town oh all those bookshops it's a dream
B	oh it's nice
A	like forty-two shops on one street
B	there's an amazing number of books there
A	forty-two bookshops yeah and all you know really rare things
B	yeah
A	each year yes yeah
B	oh oh well
A	that's well worth going they get lots of
B	that's quite different yeah
A	erm like journalists in to talk and er people into politics and
B	yeah
A	all sorts so it's not only I mean they call it a literary festival but actually it's a lot of non-fiction books as well and they get
A	you know lots of panel discussions going and fantastic
B	I I seem to remember there once when we were there they er used to have a er out in a field or somewhere like that
A	mm
B	books being given er you know you go and help yourself to a freebie
A	oh right oh that's nice
C	not bad
A	mm
B	yeah yeah
C	I've got a friend every year who goes to erm the
A	oh oh right
C	she loves she stays the whole week
B	in where?
A	it is worth going to them
C	huge one
A	I think you'd if you've not been I think they they're really quite an experience cos there's so much going on
C	yeah
A	and you book tickets for what you want to see and yeah it's good fun
C	this this friend of mine she's got a friend she stays with for the whole week it's on so she books tickets
B	she goes on the weeks I think to the
C	yeah she yeah she goes to different things every day for the week she loves it
B	yeah
A	yeah it's a nice thing to do
C	cos you get a huge range you can pick from what you want to go and listen to
A	mm
B	oh yes oh
A	it is nice yeah
C	lovely town
B	yeah I we we used to go there quite often to
A	mm
C	they're nice yes
B	the food festivals?
C	yeah
A	yeah can't go wrong with those can you?
B	no no no no you go to those and like taste this and taste the other
B	oh really?
A	and because they've got huge budgets out there
B	oh yes
A	they'd brought in the best chefs off TV not not the super super Delia Smith ones but people who are regularly on like Food Network and things
B	no
A	so you sort of vaguely knew them and they did live cooking shows and you got to eat the food afterwards
C	oh nice
A	but they
C	yeah
A	so they're only allowed fifteen minutes to make
B	yeah
A	a main course from start to finish
B	yeah
A	and then explain what they're doing all the time they have sous chefs to you know speed it up but just fantastic
B	yeah
A	yeah and the food was phenomenal this guy made made a fish curry
B	mm
A	from a piece of monkfish in fifteen minutes including all the cooking
C	that's incredible
A	just phenomenal yes the flavours
B	oh marvellous yeah
A	and then they would hand out a little card that we can go on the
B	mm
A	the website and find your the recipe but brilliant mm
B	who was that chap you used to have on television years ago? was it Floyd or something? Floyd?
A	oh there's
C	Keith Floyd yeah
A	mm
B	yeah he was good fond of his food jumping up and down and
C	very flamboyant
B	that's upside down and
C	he was like the earliest one of the earliest of the TV chefs wasn't he?
B	I suppose yes he was very different the way he used to talk mm
A	and isn't it funny that that TV format caught on?
B	mm
A	cos you would think that would be the one thing that would not translate well to TV cos food is all about the taste
B	yeah
A	I mean there's a bit in the looking at it but
B	mm
A	it's in the tasting
B	mm
A	so it's
B	oh yeah
A	we love food shows
C	and there's heaps of them out there now
A	heaps out there and it's
C	yeah
A	got more popular over time you know the Bake Off and all of those baking is such a huge thing since I've come back everyone bakes again
B	yeah
C	oh they do because of this programme
A	because of this programme everyone bakes
B	do they?
A	twenty-year-olds they all bake what do you do at the weekend? bake
B	oh oh oh
A	and it's like a Bake Off everywhere you go so like on my counselling course we have this cake rota and they you know if you say you're gonna buy the cake they go oh not gonna make anything and it's this competition every week I bought mine
B	of course years ago
C	I would too
A	yeah it's stupid
B	in years gone by
C	oh people did
A	yes
B	I mean mum was always making cakes
A	yes that's right it's back in
B	yeah
A	it's huge
B	is it back in? yeah
A	yeah yeah everyone bakes
B	I think we used to be busy busy er most weekends making cakes and my grandmother the same
A	yeah that's right mum
B	yeah
A	used to bake when I was young
B	oh did she?
A	yeah
B	yeah it's very normal yeah
A	yeah but now it's surprising cos people are very health conscious and if you bake it's
B	yeah
C	yes
B	oh yes yeah
A	and you know exactly how much has gone in cos you've just made it
B	yeah okay
A	but it's interesting that's in yeah it seems a bit contradictory you can't skip
B	I see you've been busy on er butter
C	well you were out of it
A	well it keeps doesn't it?
B	oh yes
A	it keeps forever
B	yes it does
A	yes
B	yeah
A	yes
B	yeah
A	oh well that's good
B	I've had a good chef here with
A	that's right yeah
B	yeah
A	lucky
B	good with foods
A	yes won't be hungry
B	well yes I'm always hungry most times
C	you are aren't you dad?
C	you have a good appetite
A	runs in the family
A	they all got it from you mum has a good appetite doesn't she?
A	oh my dad oh
B	yeah he
A	no
B	no no no
A	he's lost a lot of weight actually
B	oh yes
A	but only cos he does a lot more exercise
B	yes
A	but yeah a phenomenal amount
B	but he's he's he's cut back on his food though hasn't he a bit?
A	yes yes
B	yeah cos he's he's lost quite a lot of weight
A	that's right a lot he's the slimmest now since I was born I think
A	he he used to be quite slim when I was probably five or younger
B	yeah
A	and then really piled it on by the time I was seven or eight used to have a huge beer belly dad
B	oh yeah he he well he's lost about a stone hasn't he?
A	yeah he's lost an awful lot yeah
B	yeah yeah I thought
A	well that's good
B	oh good of him yes
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	is he eating the right foods?
A	I don't know really he eats less of the foods
A	I suppose it's home cooking it's not junk food
C	cos your mum was telling me the other day that he was just eating vegetables at the moment
A	yes that's not very good
C	well no because he needs a huge amount of energy for his biking
A	yes
C	exercise and
A	that's right
C	it won't all come from I don't know veggies
A	no no it won't
B	well one of the best things your dad is very good at is washing up isn't it?
A	oh yes he's very good at that yes
B	soon as you've finished the table he's got it all off and started washing
A	but not drying up he refuses to dry up
B	leaves them out does he?
A	he's got a thing about it
B	oh
A	it's quite interesting it's a real idiosyncrasy of his even when it's full
B	yeah
A	the the draining board is piled up to the point of tipping over
B	oh well
A	he won't take a single thing off what he'll do is then put out tea towels on all the surfaces and he'll keep washing up and put the
B	oh
C	really?
A	the wet things on the tea towels on the
B	to dry out yeah
C	does he have no dishwasher?
B	no but there are some things they won't put in a dishwasher
C	oh I see
B	you know if you've got like glass and stuff
C	yeah
A	big pans that won't fit yeah quite funny
B	he's quite a good cook though isn't he? he cooks sort of
A	he is now he never used to cook but actually he's quite good
B	yeah he's yeah that's right
A	yeah yeah he's not bad mm
B	yeah
A	yeah does
C	curries
A	oh okay oh that's good
B	oh he's an expert in curries isn't he?
A	from scratch? does he make the sauce?
C	yes
A	oh that's good
C	yeah oh no don't use any jars sauces or anything so
A	no oh that's good what? sort of Indian curry or Thai or a mix?
C	er
[ANNOTATION]	Person C had forgotten about the social security	Contradiction
A	mm mm
C	couple of Indonesian things actually
A	oh right oh that's nice yeah cos you can't buy that here can you really? you've got to make it
C	yeah
A	mm that's nice yeah
B	is it very much in Bahrain curries?
B	Indian stuff?
C	dominated cuisine
B	oh right
A	mm
B	I don't like Indian food at all
A	no you don't
B	no I don't like it no no no I hate the stuff
[ANNOTATION]	Person B think that he hate those things	Entailment
A	don't know how you survived there
B	you don't like it either?
A	I like it
[ANNOTATION]	Person A disagrees with Person B and like it	Neutral
B	oh you like it okay that's okay
A	yeah yeah I like it
A	I love Thai curry though that's my favourite
B	oh no don't like it
C	yes
A	and I made Thai green curry paste from scratch the other day it's actually really easy and then you can freeze it
A	you have to use it immediately or freeze but this was a no cook recipe on BBC recipe
C	right
[ANNOTATION]	Person C agrees that the recipe in BBC recipe was totally different from the things that Person A said	Entailment
A	and you just put everything in the blender
B	oh
A	you know put a few dollops in once you've cooked your chicken and whatever you're doing and a can of coconut milk and you're done recipe done it was the easiest recipe ever I've got some in the freezer
C	no you're very good I'm afraid with Thai I I got a little jar of green curry paste or red
A	ah
B	oh
A	ah
A	this one
[ANNOTATION]	Person A is going to have a sandwich	Contradiction
B	yeah
C	lazy
A	is super and it was literally in the blender but the trouble is Thai green curry paste has a million ingredients and you can't really skip so
C	yes
A	just arranging that was a headache and then chopping them all up small enough to go into the blender like lemon grass you can't really put it in whole
C	no
A	there's all sorts of other things loads of garlic
B	oh
A	coriander but the good thing is the coriander you can keep all the stalks they can go in yeah amazing colour though delicious lime juice
B	do you use the? yeah do you use the blender
C	yeah
A	er we've got one in here haven't we?
C	yes
A	mm
B	thought so yeah
A	you need it for the soups well
B	oh do you? I don't know
A	unless you don't like unless you're the sort that like the chunky soups
B	oh
A	you wouldn't like those
B	not those no
A	no
B	I like
B	erm general
A	yeah blender's very useful
B	yeah do you make your own
C	yes
B	oh they're better then
A	they're much better yeah
B	yeah if it's your own yes there's always too much salt in some of the ones you buy I think
A	yes mm
B	they're trying to get you to keep salt out of things aren't they?
A	mm
C	they are yes there's far too much in a lot
B	yeah
A	no
B	you make lots of soups then?
A	not lots erm try and do it on Saturdays if I'm at home but the problem is I'm not at home
B	oh yes
B	oh
A	doesn't happen enough yeah I make
A	all sorts of soup though I'll make a different one each time
B	oh yes I remember when we first lived at
C	I do cos there were toads down there
B	there was toads down there but when we arrived there was bottled fruit all the way down
A	oh right
B	yeah people'd left them just left them there
A	oh probably been there twenty years
A	fifty
C	did you not?
B	well no there was jars of it in there and we were all a bit scared of eating them
C	I remember those big sort of Kilner jars the glass ones
B	oh the big ones Kilner jars they used to call them yeah those big ones yeah
A	oh
B	full up with stuff
A	mm
B	what the locals used to do and that's right we used to get the frogs there
B	yeah I remember those
A	oh no that's not very nice
C	and you see these bulging eyes
B	oh no
C	it was horrible there
B	I I used to have go to and get them out and put them outside
A	oh dear
B	and send them off somewhere
C	well the thing is you see you'd open the the door to the cellar and there are these stone steps that went down and sometimes these wretched things had hopped up the steps
B	yeah oh yes frightens them
A	mm
C	and they'd be sitting on the top looking at you
B	looking at you
B	no no
B	they're funny but not very nice really are they? no no
A	oh dear
B	and it was my job to get rid of them I remember
B	oh of course there was a big place outside used to have the I suppose they used to put coal down there hadn't they I suppose?
C	yeah
A	mm
C	the coal cellar
B	there was an entrance out from down the side and
A	yeah
B	where the coal man used to tip his coals down and
A	oh right yes
B	into the cellar like yeah
A	mm
B	yeah it was
C	would anyone like anything else?
B	no that's fine dear
C	do you want me to make you anything dad?

A	I quite like toast for breakfast actually
B	oh that's right nice stuff
A	yes toast and marmalade or toast and jam
B	yes
[ANNOTATION]	Person B agrees with toast and marmalade or toast and jam	Entailment
A	yeah
B	I used to like that on the boats used to go down for breakfast in the morning have what you like in there there's
A	yeah
B	these rows and rows of different sort of foods
C	spoilt for choice yeah
A	I think breakfast is the best meal of the day if you've got some time
B	well it's supposed to be isn't it? that's right oh yeah
A	that's the trouble though you're normally rushing around in the morning but the weekend
B	no
A	I love having breakfast
B	no yeah no

C	why don't you have something better
A	well I might make porridge or
A	oh no I love it oh and if

B	oh
A	oh grandpa was laughing the other day cos I had my laptop in the the kitchen he said what's that for? that's my recipe book
B	oh
C	yeah some people use them a lot
B	well mum used to
C	yeah
B	we've got one here your
C	yeah
B	different things
A	yes that's right you have got one
B	she's got a big book of er
A	yeah
B	recipes recipes I should say
A	mm
B	yeah
B	you keep recipes
C	I do yeah
B	you do yeah mum used to keep them
C	he has yeah there's a book out there
A	mm
B	yeah
A	yes you showed me last time actually that book I
B	oh
A	carrot and leek with cream very simple but very nice
B	oh yeah carrot and leek well I like leeks
A	yeah I wouldn't've thought of putting those together actually
B	no good
A	it was good
C	do you like leeks?
B	I do eat leeks occasionally yeah
B	oh no
C	yeah there's a difference
B	I used to like
C	no
B	that's what I thought doesn't like tomatoes
A	no mum doesn't really like tomatoes either
B	oh
A	yeah yeah you always have
B	we used to grow lots of course hadn't we in
C	you did yeah
B	big fruit cage
A	mm oh lovely
B	your dad keeps a lot of stuff
A	yes he
B	yeah I thought he did yeah
A	which is worth growing actually cos it's very expensive in the shops
B	yeah
A	so it's something you should grow really cos if you've got if you're not going to grow much you should think about what's
B	yeah
A	either impossible to buy or very expensive to buy
B	yeah but he used to grow a lot of rhubarb your dad didn't he
A	yeah still yes he still grows quite a bit but I think he's he's not so good at
B	yeah
A	the weeding now so it tends to get swamped
B	oh given up on that yeah
A	there are some plants in there
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	oh I think
A	yeah he's yes he's not done much for years and mum kind of took over for a bit but yes he's got back into it a bit I think
B	oh that's pretty good
A	it's funny isn't it?
B	yeah
A	you know he's he used to be really into his gardening
A	yes but then it sort of got inversely proportional the more time he had the less time he spent out there
B	oh I suppose so yeah
A	but mum thought it was because when we were young he didn't like being in the house with all the noise
B	oh go outside
C	oh
A	wasn't really cos he liked gardening
B	oh have to get outside
A	would just say I'm going to work in the garden
B	yeah
A	and get off the hook
C	has to go and have his peace
A	yes that's right cos he used to have an allotment when we were young and he used to go down there every Saturday
B	oh oh
A	get away from us I think
C	did he?
B	yeah
C	where was that then?
B	it's it's er it's
B	yeah it's growing in popularity again isn't it now?
A	it's huge yeah
B	now the story was in the paper the other day
A	long waiting lists
B	yeah that's right people getting allotments
A	mm cos it's erm a legal requirement of all councils to provide allotments if there's sufficient demand but sufficient demand in law is set at six people
B	oh
A	and they're not allowed to charge extortionate rents they have to charge
B	no no
A	a peppercorn rent which is proportional
B	oh yeah
A	so they're only charging about twenty-five pounds a year usually if that
B	yeah
A	there's huge demand
C	not surprised
B	yeah
A	yeah I've been in touch with the local council at
C	did you get a reply?
A	yeah a long reply saying oh yes we had originally put them on the plans but then we decided it was too near the sports field so we've decided to put them somewhere else but now it's back with the the legal people it's just an excuse
C	mm
A	er it's just
B	oh
A	the developers have obviously paid a backhander I I thought
B	oh
A	er
B	keep sending reminders dear
A	yeah yes it's annoying actually they're
A	but that's
B	would you like an allotment would you?
A	I'd love one
B	oh
A	yeah yeah my garden's tiny I can't really grow
B	oh
A	fruit and veg in it
B	there's some people they with their I know with allotments they spend hours and hours
A	yeah that's right yeah
A	it's a good keep fit thing I suppose
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	well we used to grow a lot of those
A	mm
B	we used to have all these great big er poles in the garden
A	oh right
B	yeah
A	oh lovely
B	years ago
A	mm
B	but I'm never
A	that's right
C	well there's quite a bit being grown at the
B	oh well I suppose we'd had quite and I suppose
A	oh right
B	cos there was a big wall and it faced the sun
A	yeah oh lovely
C	you had a what they call a cucumber frame didn't you?
B	oh I had a cucumber
C	mm
B	oh yes we used to have cucumbers in there and grapes
A	mm
C	there were sliding erm doors weren't there on the top of it?
B	oh yes that's right what what did we use to have? er I had a greenhouse there with lots of stuff in didn't I?
C	you did yeah
B	yes I
C	yes it did get broken didn't it? yeah
B	it did yeah used to get broken occasionally somebody
B	no no
A	mm
B	on the other hand there's no excuse not to use it though
C	this is true
B	and mum used to
A	mm
B	your mum used to like going in the greenhouse
A	she's got obsessed with her greenhouse yeah
B	yeah yeah I've seen her
A	yeah it was dad's thing but he never used it so she's taken over and it's become her thing now
B	I I noticed yeah
A	yeah she got all her tomato
B	yeah she
A	cos I sent her some seeds the other day in the post cos you can get free seeds quite often from various companies er Heinz
C	mm
B	yeah Thompson's
A	Heinz are giving away free
B	oh yeah
A	the people who do the soup as well they give away free tomato seeds every year so I sent for some for her and she's got they do much better than mine hers are like that big on the windowsill
C	oh
A	and she grew tomatoes last year but from plug plants
B	oh yeah
A	erm and they were quite successful kept them in the greenhouse
B	when she comes over
A	yeah
B	she sometimes goes and buys some flowers doesn't she?
A	yes
B	for plants
A	yeah I like buying
B	where does she go now?
A	plants garden centre didn't she? she took you
A	she took you to a garden centre about
B	a garden centre somewhere?
C	yeah that's right yeah
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	that's where she used to go yeah
C	it's nice over there
B	that's good gardens there yeah
A	mm
B	er she wondering around there it's quite biggish isn't it there?
A	be quite pricey though garden centres
B	yes grandma used to
A	I've been quite surprised at the prices in them

A	very expensive
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	I'm surprised
C	I've never been in one that isn't
A	no
A	yeah I'm quite
C	and you know the supermarkets all sell you know some bedding plants and they're much much cheaper very often than garden centres
A	yes yeah
B	they are yeah
A	yes that's what I do I go to the the supermarket if I want something
C	yeah
A	just you know fill a bed
C	yeah
A	then you're better off going to the supermarket and paying five pounds cos you'll get loads
A	true yes
B	yeah
A	mm
B	yes
A	that's right yeah that's right yes
C	yes
B	pots of flowers and stuff they sell
A	mm
B	I think your mum often buys stuff at Morrisons doesn't she?
A	yeah that's why I often get erm plants from the supermarket and flowers cut flowers are good as well
B	cos she she's into gardening a bit now isn't she your mum?
A	oh she loves it yeah
B	I know that surprised me
A	yeah all sorts yeah she grew tomatoes last year we never heard the end of it every week we get an update

B	yeah that's right
A	yes got really into it
B	does she have the big ones or the little ones as well?
A	oh don't
B	oh yeah
C	she's probably measuring them
B	oh no cos sometimes you get them this size don't you the tomatoes?
C	yeah
A	I've given her a pumpkin plant this year
B	oh I never liked pumpkins
A	cos I thought that is a fun thing to grow because
B	yeah
A	you first of all once they get going they grow amazingly fast like a foot
B	yeah
A	and then it's fun when the pumpkin grows
B	mm
A	cos they just start small and then you just watch them growing and
B	oh
A	it's quite a funny thing to have cos they can grow enormous can't they?
C	yeah
A	if you get
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	if the conditions are right they can grow to huge great things
B	I know I think it's a
A	mm
B	and he used to
A	oh right
B	and they used to put people's name on the and the name get bigger and bigger and bigger as they grew
C	yeah
A	oh that's nice

C	yeah
A	colour the texture
B	oh
A	oh fantastic mm so simple
B	oh
A	yeah
B	but do you eat it as well besides that do you? you eat pumpkin or is it always a soup?
A	yeah I roast it I do roast it sometimes
C	yeah yeah
B	roast it yeah
C	yeah
A	but mostly I just make soup from it
B	yeah soup with it yes oh well
A	yes yeah
B	I know they used to I know

A	yeah
B	to sell off like

A	I always wonder about people's stomachs with tattoos with that if they realise what's going to happen when they put on weight
B	oh
A	it's going to
C	the thought's never occurred to me but yes
A	or conversely if they lost weight what would happen?
C	yes
A	so you can't really lose or gain weight again for the rest of your life
C	reason not have a tattoo
A	yes put it somewhere which doesn't stretch like your back

B	oh yeah?
A	where you can even buy them they don't even know what it is
B	parsnip? no no
A	even Spain where they eat most things they've never heard of them they're like what's that?
B	oh there we are
A	a white carrot you mean?
B	oh
A	they think you're mad
C	oh no
B	yeah
C	no similarity in taste
B	no no no
A	no
B	no terribly different parsnip
A	I love roast parsnips
B	I think they're awful things
A	they're fantastic mm
B	but my dad used to like parsnips
C	did he?
B	yeah he loved parsnips
A	mm you don't like many vegetables I don't think though grandpa

A	mm?
B	it was general De Gaulle said didn't he about English food? said the only thing they like in England is sprouts
A	it's true
B	he used to say he was
C	boiled to death
B	derogatory about er English food compared with the French food yeah
A	I remember when when my dad's dad my grandpa other grandpa erm erm his wife died she died a lot younger my grandma
B	yeah
A	then
A	and we said well what do you mean by modern vegetables?
C	what's a modern vegetable?
A	he went there's this thing called broccoli
A	and you'd have to try and keep a straight face
B	yeah yeah
A	and say
C	ah it's what you're used to isn't it?
A	is that modern?
B	modern broccoli yeah okay
A	he thought that was a really modern vegetable
B	it is a modern
C	and he didn't like it?
A	oh no he said I have to
B	yeah
A	I thought that was a great
B	yeah yeah
A	cos it's actually quite an English thing broccoli the same
C	they serve it a lot in restaurants
A	yes
B	yeah
A	but obviously not where he was from
B	no
A	that was funny
B	are you a broccoli eater
C	yeah
B	oh
A	I suppose the thing was vegetables would've been very localised when he was young
B	oh yes cheaper to buy
A	so like sort of that end of the country
B	yeah
A	they grow a lot of vegetables but it's certain things they grow a lot of celery
B	yeah
A	and they'll grow sugar beet and asparagus there's certain things they'll grow tons off the field and that would supply the you know all of the south east
B	oh
A	but they wouldn't grow broccoli I don't know where they used to grow broccoli but
B	no
B	I remember
A	mm
C	yeah
B	people with selling er broccoli and potatoes and all of the other things
A	mm
B	and that's died away now I suppose those big market
A	except in London where they're really popular still
A	yeah yeah and it's really worth going
B	yeah
A	these big well I say open air I mean they're sort of in massive sort of warehouse type things but right in the centre like
C	yeah
B	oh Spitalfields?
A	yeah that's very popular it's quite expensive though
B	I didn't
A	it's not cheap
B	yes they have all sorts of foods in that part don't they?
A	yes it's great
B	foreign
A	yes
B	Indian and all parts yeah I know
A	that's right if you're having trouble tracking down ingredients that's where you'd go
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	but when you walk through Spitalfields you don't know you're in England almost the different nationalities there
A	no
B	yeah
A	that's London
B	do you know Spitalfields

A	mm
B	what here?
C	no in our my garden
B	oh your garden oh yes
C	and
A	yes
A	yeah
C	routine maintenance I find a real chore
A	mm well maybe you should cheat and put something like you know the wood bark you can buy the
C	keep the weeds down
A	yeah just and then just make a hole and put in
B	yeah
A	things that could cope
C	yes it is
A	yeah
B	cos
C	yes she is yeah
A	mm
B	she likes her she likes her gardening a little bit
A	yes she does
B	I think she's given me some stuff from time to time little plants
A	that's nice
B	they've all died off by now of course
A	yeah well someone's done those pots outside those little asters or yeah they look like asters just by the the back door they're all going still
B	what? which one of those left?
A	a
C	I think I put them in ages ago I'm surprised they're still alive
A	yeah they're fine
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	me too yes
A	yeah I pull the odd weed out when I go by but they're actually fine they're all in they've been flowering for months

A	he's got these particular catchphrases that once you've realised his catchphrase and you hear it all the time and you're like oh
C	you're almost listening out for it aren't you? and it comes
A	that's the trouble and then you you want to scream
[ANNOTATION]	Gordon Ramsey is actually a good chef, even though he's a TV chef.	Neutral
C	yes
B	oh yes?
A	yeah
B	oh Jamie Oliver is that him?
C	yeah
B	oh yes is he still on television then?
A	yeah yeah he's
B	oh
[ANNOTATION]	Jamie Oliver is not on TV still.	Contradiction
B	yeah
A	chips and junk food
B	did they? yeah
A	not a single vegetable piece of fruit to be found and he had a real campaign he took on the government and said that's ridiculous
B	yeah
A	not only are you ruining their health now you're not teaching them good habits for the future so school dinner should be healthy and he won the he got rid of all the chips and rubbish in schools all those Turkey Twizzlers that was his thing wasn't it?
B	yeah
C	Turkey Twizzlers
A	Turkey Twizzlers
C	yes yeah
B	yeah
A	there's no meat in them nobody knew what was in them it certainly wasn't meat
[ANNOTATION]	Jamie Oliver does not care about the children's health.	Contradiction
B	oh no oh no
A	yes
C	er he did a lot of good with that campaign
A	although he did yes
B	yes okay
A	the children didn't like it but then they wouldn't would they? if
B	no no no
A	you suddenly had your chips switched for vegetables
B	no well I suppose I see what's-his-name now little
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Even though the children were not happy, it was good for them.	Entailment
C	yeah
A	I wonder what he does in school
B	yeah I suppose
[ANNOTATION]	All children loved that measure.	Contradiction
A	probably goes down the chip shop
B	I
A	well I think they've stopped after Jamie Oliver
B	I remember once
A	well maybe they haven't I don't know
C	you can still get some stuff I wouldn't necessarily put on a menu I think but it's a lot better than it was
A	yeah oh that's good see Japan when I lived there in the schools where I worked the county council would employ a nutritionist to write menus for the entire school district broken down into how many calories how much protein enormous detail and it was mapped out months and months ahead
B	oh yeah
[ANNOTATION]	A used to live in Japan but he doesn't anymore.	Entailment
A	and that is what they produce centrally and it would come to the school and that was what you got everyone had exactly the same food and it was of quite a high calorie content
B	yeah
A	because they said children need a lot of calories but low fat low salt you know low other things and it was very good
C	sounds excellent
A	yeah
B	oh
A	and it was their kind of food I mean it wouldn't catch on here but you'd always get a bowl of rice
A	white rice cos they always eat white rice
B	oh no they're welcome to that
A	yeah and they have a small piece of fish grilled usually
B	yeah
A	or a maybe a small piece of chicken but usually it was fish always some sort of vegetable piece of fruit yoghurt yeah just there would be five or six different things on a tray
C	sounds very healthy yeah
B	yeah
A	that was it and always milk you'd always have a little carton of milk
B	oh
A	yeah and they said please eat it all cos it's a bad example to the children if you don't
B	oh yeah yeah
A	yes
C	yes
A	yeah that's a fish
A	it's a nice fish
A	yeah I that's one of my favourites actually
B	what? bream yeah
A	yes cos in Spain they always have that
B	yeah
A	I think it's called dorado in in Spanish I'd always
B	yeah
A	look for it on the menu
B	can't think where I had this bream but must be somewhere
A	I think it was
B	oh
A	yeah
B	oh we're supposed to be taking you to

A	yes
B	the sun comes over there and goes all the way around so we've got
A	get sun don't you? yes
B	we have erm sunshine in here most of the day now
A	ah
A	yes no so I've turned it off now so that's that
B	yeah that's good
A	yeah
B	you ever read this magazine?
A	I don't actually no
B	Private Eye? no you don't
A	no you've got your friend used to be editor didn't he? your colleague
B	yeah oh yes oh yes Aubrey Waugh
B	yes I'd forgotten yes
B	yeah I know I know it's
A	no one ever dies
B	yeah yeah
A	I bet he does think that doesn't he?
B	there's always a lot of humour in that
A	yes
B	in fact
B	he this this friend of mine was the editor of that lot years ago
B	yes
A	it's it's very good yeah
B	yes it's quite a good
A	it's talking about the erm the EU thing it's
A	brilliant isn't it?
B	yeah it is quite good
A	are you going to vote grandpa for the
B	oh I expect so
A	referendum?
B	you can take it up to read it if you want to
A	oh no no I'll leave it here I'll just have a little look though
B	yeah
A	have you decided how you're going to vote or not yet?
B	yeah I I forget there's one on if I
A	next month yeah referendum
B	it's next month is it? oh no no no that's okay
A	mm EU or not the EU
B	no but I suppose we have to be in the EU I suppose
A	I think most people are going to vote to stay
B	I think so yeah
A	yes yes that's it's not good for everybody of course to be in the EU
B	well no no no it's
A	small businesses it's probably the worst possible thing in the world
B	yeah
A	because there's too much competition for them and too much red tape
B	that's right
A	but it's good if you're an employee of a much larger company
B	yes
A	because then you would have you know good opportunities
B	 tunity yeah yes
A	and probably quite safe your job's quite safe
B	yeah I expect yeah
A	but yes it's not good for small businessman or small farmers
B	no
A	I think they are suffering but of course it's not only economics you have to think about safety and security and
B	yeah
A	whether we're safer in or out and I suppose the strength
B	that's the point it's it's it's about fifty-fifty some would say
A	I think yes
B	yeah yeah
A	we did a straw poll today at lunch
B	oh did you?
A	and I wodnered how representative that was because it was sort of eighty-twenty
B	oh was it?
A	eighty for in so I thought well if that's representative then we'll end up staying in
B	yeah
A	mm
B	oh I I thought supposed to be very close most of them
A	well maybe it is
B	cos they do get it wrong on these pollsters don't they?
A	they
B	in the last election we were miles out
A	they thought it was going to be really close but it was a landslide
B	yeah it was a landslide yeah
A	they were they were way off
B	yeah
A	yeah yeah that's quite interesting how wrong they've been I suppose a lot of people don't decide until the very last minute
B	yeah yes
A	and they might have a gut feeling but that doesn't mean they'd necessarily go with that at the last minute
B	no no no
A	they might just talk to their friends and then you know everyone else says oh I voted for him and then there's sort of a
B	yes
A	almost a domino effect
B	yeah some people don't even know what they're voting till they get into the booth
A	I don't think so no
B	no they they just look at the names and if they like the look of one they tick that box
A	no I think not
B	yeah it's very
A	yeah I don't like him
B	there we are
A	yes
B	yes it's quite amusing reading some of it well
B	yeah
A	yeah it's very funny
B	this chappy comes on the television used to be used to be writing to that forgotten his name now er
B	he still comes on every so often
A	oh right
B	wish I could remember his name it's
B	doesn't have a very big circulation I don't think that sort of
A	no but it's kept going hasn't it? which is nice
B	no no yeah they must have a job making it pay its way I think
A	yeah
B	bit of a job
A	well even the big dailies are struggling aren't they? like the Guardian and things
B	oh the big ones yeah that's right yeah yeah yeah
A	it's surprising actually they've kept going in a way
B	yes erm especially one of those it's quite small really I suppose
A	but apparently eighty percent of their revenue is advertising so
B	well I suppose they've got all
A	as long as they've got that on the back they'll probably keep going
B	oh oh oh that's right
A	yeah there's quite a lot of advertising isn't there?
B	advertising yeah so they won't advertise eventually if there's not enough circulation will you?
A	no well no that's true there's going to reach a critical point where they'll pull their ads
B	yeah they'll want to they'll want to be paying up if er
A	yes
B	no one's buying it
A	but at the moment it seems although they do advertise on the internet people ignore it
B	yeah
A	whereas you're more likely it seems to look at adverts in print
B	I think that's true actually you don't bother to think about what's on the radio there the telly
A	yes
B	but you see it in the flesh you read it
A	yes
B	yeah
A	so it's not just a numbers game it's about how effective it might be
B	yeah be yeah
A	in reaching your readerhood
B	okay
A	yeah
B	do you do you watch many programmes?
A	erm I have a thing called Netflix now which is erm
B	Netflix
A	a subscriber based TV package
B	oh
A	and there's lots of things on there so I do watch a bit now
B	oh
A	so it's all pre-recorded
B	cos they think English television's probably the best in the world don't they?
A	yeah
B	in America it's mostly adverts isn't it?
A	that's right yes
B	well a lot of them anyhow
A	yes yes that is true
B	and we do get a little bit of advertising here but not very much
A	no
B	no no
A	no
B	nothing on the BBC but
A	that's good
B	little bit on the others occasionally
A	yes yeah that's good
B	yes er yes I think so we both better
A	yes
B	up and out we've had a
A	I expect you
B	well I usually go to sleep doesn't take
A	yes
B	doesn't take me long to go to sleep I'm asleep in about five minutes
B	I'll put this one off
A	yeah
A	I have yes yes it'll be nice
A	yes it's a good idea
A	yes
B	those off we need to pull the plug out and make doubly sure
