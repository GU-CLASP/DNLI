A	like an ordinance survey one maybe
F	well actually
B	and also you know
A	yeah
B	if it's sometimes fear
G	yeah
B	you want them to think that you're not scared about anything
G	like when we when we took him on the plane
B	mm
G	usually I'm terrified of flying but
B	yeah
G	just cos I couldn't be
A	yeah
B	you you I didn't know you were terrified of flying I'm I'm awful
G	yeah I know
B	shouldn't be up there should we?
F	if you think about
B	I used to have to take a valium

A	yeah
F	we had a nice walk a nice lunch
B	and sometimes I think I just book international flights just for an excuse to take the valium
G	fly to Sweden yeah
B	how was that?
G	it was fine he was
B	when was it?
G	oh when erm
B	yeah
G	so it was snowing
B	that's quite young to fly though isn't it?
G	yeah yeah
B	I think it does a lot of stuff to the
G	yeah I mean luckily
B	oh yeah
G	you you feel the pressure of
G	yeah exactly
B	we travelled on a bus for thirteen hours once and the baby will have cried for eleven of those
G	yeah
B	like another woman had to go up to her it was a young really young mum on her own
G	yeah
B	seventeen-year-old
B	like big busty old fifty-year-old woman and
G	yeah
B	and that was the only thing that stopped them
G	yeah
B	like I know but
G	there's no there's
B	yeah
G	they either cry cos they want something or
B	yeah
G	there's colic
D	but I cried non stop
G	but it's if you've got colic I suppose as well that's
B	mm
G	because of something going on in the stomach
B	I had colic
G	really?
B	atrocious
G	er
B	atrocious
A	where's
A	it's a long way
F	well it's not a long way but
F	it is
A	yeah
B	free as a bird
G	this is this is what we have to do constantly at home it is just
D	yeah but
G	no okay
G	no I mean she like
B	she's really honest about how erm
G	yeah she she
B	refreshingly
G	I think
B	right
G	and I think you're just making a rash decision and
B	yeah
G	yeah
B	it's just a huge responsibility isn't it?
G	yeah
B	I think if you panic about it shows you're taking it seriously and you actually give a crap about it
G	but just like have I beaten have I already got
B	for sireing
B	oh for for arriving
G	I think he's lost
B	think er you get half a point for saying birth instead of er
G	here we go
G	not any more
B	not any more
G	not any more
B	I do feel some kind of like grief for him being in a relationship
B	yeah I remember I remember taking to a pub taking to a a brothel actually
A	yeah exactly
A	this one goes to the church at
A	oh right so there
D	yeah but so I I I I
F	yeah yeah yeah right yeah you're right
G	yeah
B	I thought it would be
G	yeah
B	do you remember her dad pointed a gun at me?
G	no
B	yeah well
G	yeah
B	I was round the house he had a massive house not dissimilar to this
G	yeah
B	a big country house in
B	and that was the first day and then as I went to leave the house my mum was picking me up
B	he was there getting like had jacket on and he's got a dogs and he used to go off hunting like he he obviously me and him were
G	yeah
B	never gonna yeah and as I went there he went so you're
G	yeah
B	and then he went on his shoulder
G	I dunno
A	are you gonna go to the cider place now then?
D	no
A	right
B	oh yeah so yeah so and I was telling that story to
G	yeah
B	never done it
B	I was like you've never been?
G	yeah
B	never done it
B	no don't you wouldn't find many like twenty-seven-year-olds or whatever it was at the time
G	no definitely
B	you know you're missing out on all that awkwardness and good anecdotes come from that
G	well yeah
B	I think he went over there
G	yeah
B	so I think I guess so then
G	oh right okay cool
B	they're quite garish and limey isn't it?
G	yeah
B	apparently mum and
G	yeah
B	that's like
G	yeah
B	I'm not sure about painting bricks but it would be quite heavy without it
G	yeah it would be yeah
B	I don't know if you should paint the nature
G	I've got that decision to make in the garden because the the houses I mean a lot of the terrace
B	but where do you mean though?
G	as in down either side of the garden
B	yeah
G	and on the back
B	yeah but like like dry stone walling but with but with cement
G	yeah yeah and it's
B	yeah
G	it's not like it was made by with any skill
G	it just yeah it was just lumped together and people have
B	probably a lot of
G	yeah there is and over the years people have like just packed concrete into it to try and keep it up
B	we had to in the old
G	yeah
B	and I remember you could more or less pull a massive brick out
G	and what what I want to do is
B	mm
G	you know? that you see like like a dark slate grey
B	yeah
G	I think I will
B	can you put like
G	like a screen yeah I I've got one of those actually
G	but
B	yeah
G	it's pretty good I'll see if I
B	we're really lucky in Britain actually that in the poorest houses
G	yeah I know
B	oh that's lovely
G	so it goes
B	yeah
G	I mean this isn't this is sort of like them in we've got a little bit more room behind me as well
B	yeah
G	so that's all a raised border up there and I've put herbs and things in there
B	yeah
G	and we've built like a raised area where there's gonna be a patio
B	and you can put vines or whatever up there
G	yes
B	yeah
G	and this is all chippings down below
G	yeah
B	you're not gonna have grass down anywhere then?
G	well
B	nice for
G	yeah but the thing is is the is the drainage going to be enough? etcetera
B	mm
G	so we may still do
B	you can almost like well you obviously know more about that but you can almost like
G	you can yeah
G	Astroturf
G	but on like a pool roll
B	on a pool roll?
G	like you know like a pool cover
B	yeah
G	that you pull out over the chippings
B	right
G	that then
B	it's not that comfortable though is it?
G	no I know
B	yeah to play it would be fine but then
G	but then we've got the dog so
B	right yeah it's gonna become a litter tray then
G	yeah
B	I don't know I find it quite
G	yeah I I
B	yeah
B	you're very lucky
G	he helped me he helped us do the pool and things like that so
B	yeah
G	as a moving present
B	not too many around there
G	sorry?
B	not too many out there
G	well I'm going to get one once the patio is finished
B	mm mm
G	yeah so it's
B	what's your what's your view on fairy lights?
G	tastefully
B	yeah I quite like white
G	yeah
B	I mean obviously white
G	yeah
B	blue er sapphire blue at a push
G	yeah
B	no
B	yeah yeah yeah
G	or no not oil lamps but all the bases were sort of a bit rusty
B	mm
G	and I did have an idea to sort of clean them up and paint them and sell them or whatever but
B	yeah
G	I haven't got round to it but all the glass bits are all fine
B	mm
G	but I'm thinking about using those just for for garden lights instead
B	yeah yeah
G	cos they're perfect cos
B	yeah
G	these ones don't have bottoms so
B	yeah
G	ah
B	it's mad not to have solar lights though isn't it?
G	it is but yeah I know
B	solar power is
G	but then where do you do you sort of?
B	yeah yeah and then you're powering your house on your manure
B	you want like I like I I'm weird about lighting like I I really like dim lights
G	yeah
B	and I think they
G	yeah
B	by
G	where's the er where's the toilet?
B	which one?
B	that one in there is probably the best one

B	so those tiles came with it those are like a hundred years old those tiles
A	they sat up?

B	there needs to be
B	I need to justify it somehow

G	this is the future of charging well not quite if you've got the
G	but erm
B	ah

B	yeah
G	but like I

B	yeah got that to look forward to haven't we?
A	what's this?

A	yeah
G	trip you're on a trip cos your
A	mum and dad are coming
G	going yeah so
A	on Friday and then we'll drive back with them and then you're only there till Monday

G	well it's essentially that it's essentially that
B	yeah
B	are they awful?
G	yeah I mean
B	I think they're
G	the
B	mm
B	I think they would be my idea of
G	but
B	yeah yeah
B	but also like put the keep them altogether in a in a lockable room
B	rather than let them infiltrate
G	she's had some
B	she's had some work
A	mm
G	what's she had done?
B	so what's the er
G	B to
B	B to a D
G	oh I see
B	you know bras right?
B	you know they have all different numbers and letters on them
B	erm so what's the etiquette?
G	I think I think a girl could but I don't know if a
B	there you go
A	what sorry?
B	you're allowed to
A	do you reckon? I don't know if I want to I'd feel a bit weird doing that
G	I suppose it depends on your relationship with them I suppose
A	yeah
B	what's your relationship with
A	not enough that I could squeeze them
B	have a look?
A	yeah I think well I don't want to look at them raw I wanna just
G	if she had a bra on
A	in a bra's fine or in a vest top
B	in a lovely blouse
B	no we were just there
G	yeah
B	well there for Christmas
G	yeah
B	it came to her and she was like
G	fair enough

G	do you know he's become like a
B	I I see his nonsense about running all the time and he's not a million miles away from putting
B	yeah
G	he's also inherited his dad has given him the removals removals company
B	oh yeah?
G	taxi vans
G	which he does on as well
B	property
B	I'm not that should be a legally allowed or morally allowed anyway
G	and guess what his girlfriend's name is?
B	is it
G	no
B	that would be cool
G	and the the worst thing is is that her name doesn't really she's really nice
B	it yeah
B	yeah so so she's not a
G	no definitely not
B	what's her surname?
G	yeah
B	he was voted handsomest boy in
B	the poll I did in my head
B	we used to hang around with him quite a bit didn't we?
G	yeah
B	yeah
B	lived in Spain for a bit didn't he? Ibiza or something
G	Lanzarote I think it was
B	his Spanish was really good as well it annoyed me
G	was it?
B	well like he'd been there for like we we had a chat with
G	yeah
B	but like he'd been there for six months like a year
G	yeah
A	who's this?
B	just a guy we went to school with
A	oh right
G	erm
A	yeah
G	but I can't quite remember what the the
B	that was a great pub
G	but I don't remember what it was like I don't remember it
B	do you know where it is though?
G	sort of seen a picture
B	behind that fruit van
G	yeah yeah of course
B	you went in erm
G	cos we went there a few times
B	yeah loads of times yeah
G	yeah
B	good pub
G	I just can't remember what it was like inside and it was just
B	it's a bit like the
G	yeah
B	dark
G	when I last time I went
G	last time I went to
B	ah
G	yeah it was a good day out
B	we've got that polaroid somewhere
G	yeah it's it's in a box somewhere I think
B	I don't think I could do that for
G	yeah
B	yeah christ
G	no?
B	I'd
G	yeah definitely
B	they get
B	especially if it's got problems which
G	yeah
B	and then there's
G	it's like when I think about it or when
B	yeah
G	quite nice
B	mm
G	I really like going up there
B	yeah
G	she
B	yeah
G	erm part of that was to do I mean she left as soon as she could part of that was to do with people and just
B	yeah
G	having nothing to do there which is true
B	yeah
G	but it's when we visit you know we go go for a walk along the river there's a little steam railway
B	you're looking at it something
G	you look at it as a tourist sort of thing
B	well not just that but age like you look you're looking at a place in a different way and you want to have different activities and different pastimes when you're twenty-nine than you do when you're nineteen
G	yeah
B	I dunno I felt I don't like really what they've done to
B	we don't need KFC down there
G	yeah
B	yeah
G	lots of big creative things there
B	right okay
G	but the pubs and stuff there it's a bit more interesting these days
B	yeah
A	what type of studio sorry? like film studios?
B	yeah proper film and TV studios there
A	oh okay
B	Valley Wood they call it cos you've got like
A	oh okay
B	obviously Bollywood and Nollywood which is Nigerian I think
A	yeah yeah
G	yeah
A	mm
G	but then I thought I really don't like going back on myself so I thought is there a way to go all the way back round to the
B	no
G	it's like this big kind of reedy marsh that we were just past the
B	really?
G	like really nice bird watching and things like that
B	really?
G	and then I just and then I walked over the flyover erm between
B	yeah
G	nearby that Morrisons there
B	yeah
G	and that's kind of like a vision of what
B	it's nothing to me about my life
G	no exactly
B	Morrisons here but obviously it doesn't
G	no
[ANNOTATION]	they agree	Contradiction
B	and it's just you've got to this
F	I think I can see people
A	oh yes?
A	oh right
F	I've made a salad
F	so I've just done tomatoes
A	okay
F	I haven't done anything else
G	yeah exactly
B	and I don't drive but anyway even if I did like that's not and and I know
G	yeah yeah
B	and you can't force community and you can't force these aspects and they're just so
[ANNOTATION]	they mention vegetables	Entailment
G	yeah yeah
B	and that's what has happened to a lot of British high streets cos the high street doesn't exist any more
G	but I mean
B	yeah yeah
G	cos it's kind of iconic that one
B	yeah
G	yeah otherwise you'd just have that kind of new build
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	hey
A	found it
F	yeah
A	hey where did you go?
[ANNOTATION]	there's still a high street in every village in Britain	Contradiction
C	er I went to the cider
G	I you didn't see
[ANNOTATION]	speaker c never left	Contradiction
A	look at you looking all countrified
A	I'm good
F	so where did you end up?
C	well I was at I went to the cider place
A	yeah okay like a homing pigeon just found it
A	oh
C	and then once I got to the cider place I couldn't then readjust my satnav because there was no reception
A	oh I see
[ANNOTATION]	the connection was so bad speaker c could'nt get satnav	Entailment
F	ah
C	and apparently they guy at the cider place doesn't know where this place is
A	that's bad he
C	so I kind of drove around a bit
A	oh
B	I think he knew he was from the big city and he just
G	has has anyone bought a large quantity of cider in the last?
C	I said I said I was like I there are some Welsh men here?
A	yeah
C	have you seen them?
F	and he and he said no
C	the other one may have been talking about darts
F	so you found they found him in the in the cider
C	I drove back to the one where yeah where I was supposed to
F	ah
A	when in doubt always return to your fixed designated meeting point
C	well I I
B	right
D	and I thought oh well you know he can hit traffic or or
C	I said I'm leaving I'm leaving
D	yeah
C	I'll be at the place in ninety minutes
D	well there's traffic and there's
C	and then there's no reception here so I couldn't communicate
F	no
A	no
F	it's all your fault
C	no no it's was my fault
D	there's also there was also directions in the attachment email right?
C	yeah but I didn't I cos you were saying meet at the cider place and I don't know there

B	what do you mean coming up for the winter?
E	eh?
B	what do you mean coming up for the winter?
E	they I think they hatch out
B	yeah
E	and they still
A	bit dopey
B	cos there was one on your leg and we were going like that around it and it wouldn't didn't fly off
E	yeah they say there's a torpor there
B	I thought there was a
E	no although funny enough we're talking to her and I said did you have much
A	oh really?
E	yeah I've heard that you know? a lot of these barns have bat what do they call them? bat nests? not nests
B	belfries
E	belfries whatever
A	is that what it's called?
B	no the belfry's like a
E	but you can't er
A	oh right
B	you wouldn't have to get planning permission cos the barn already existed so if you're modifying you're not extending it
E	no it's changing the use changing use it's changing to a dwelling but she said that was fine
B	but bats also are endangered now because of the erm
E	that's what they said
B	turbines affecting sonar
E	they said you
B	yeah how many farmers do you reckon know there's bats in here and then kill them before anyone finds out?
E	mm
B	did I tell you I
A	I don't like bats very much
B	oh they're quite pretty I think
A	no they're quite unnerving
B	they won't attack
A	no as in like
B	yeah they do they do
A	oh
E	don't women think they're gonna get in their hair?
A	yeah I just the whole I just oh no
B	do you remember that Attenborough thing?
E	do you know have you heard of Guano?
B	yeah
E	mm
B	why? is it just a good fertilizer?
E	well apparently erm
D	Spanish though isn't it?
E	I'm not sure
B	yeah
E	mm
B	like Guadalajara or Guadalupe or whatever
E	yeah
B	that's comes from the Arabic for water
E	guarda like bit like aqua
B	yeah could be yeah so Guano probably means because it's quite water based
E	mm well
B	yeah
E	shows how er
A	when they built the staircase they couldn't decide
B	cos there was there was mountains on it in this cave
E	yeah
B	is it is it can you set fire to it? is it like erm
E	I don't know
B	yeah I can't believe that at all
E	well
B	no I'm not saying I'm not surprised that the sheep aren't the biggest
E	no you you would think so wouldn't you?
D	what was it?
A	you wanna make the most of that
C	that's it
E	just got a problem here with some
B	dad but if you're on holiday you shouldn't be looking at that
E	I know but she asked me to do it
B	yeah but then she shouldn't be asking you to do that
E	they've sent her a notice of redundancy but they've backdated it
B	oh god
E	it only affected when you have the letter they they can they can send you a letter saying you're now redundant
B	yeah
E	they can't send you a letter saying you were redundant last
B	course you can't
E	Tuesday which is what they have done
B	is she not in
E	well I am that's me and er
B	no but she's in there?
E	they do Scope don't allow trade unions that's why I'm
B	don't they?
E	doing it
B	why?
E	erm
B	how do they get away with it?
E	just from
B	oh is it legal without the unions?
E	you can you could have she could have representation of a of a trade union personalised by
E	but they don't accept collective bargaining which is essentially what trade union is
B	but she can still be a member obviously?
E	yeah didn't do her much good actually
B	yeah because then they you wouldn't be working out your notice would you if they backdate it?
E	no
B	she's got a strong case then hasn't she?
E	well that's what I'm doing there but er she's er
B	but anyway that all will be that backdated letter that as evidence will still be there on Monday just as it is now
E	her her date is gone by Monday though
C	oh no
A	yeah
B	is there anyone else who does your job when you're not there?
E	no it's
E	they've done as classic bosses thing right? they wanted to close
B	oh
E	no er
D	yeah
B	yeah
E	and all of the people there er all got a lot of different disabilities all adults and they bus them in so Scope pay for a minibus to go and collect them
B	bus the workers in?
E	no no the er the the the service users
B	right
E	they they come from
B	the disabled people you mean then? but then if you're employing almost exclusively disabled people how to expect them to get by definition the most of them aren't gonna be allowed to drive
E	no we bus them in there these minibuses go round and picks them up and takes them in
B	I'm saying
E	that's right
B	they don't want to spend twenty grand of their yearly budget
E	so the place is probably going to have to close
B	is that like Remploy?
E	erm no Remploy was doing actually work for which they got paid this is
B	yeah
E	and then it's the local authority's fault
B	bit of a malicious decision
E	yes it is
B	who's making that?
E	they've abolished the Wales area and moved us into a south which is Cornwall and Devon and all that and the head of that person so I'm gonna
B	all of those things are intangible aren't they? I'm not saying they don't exist but they
E	yes
B	not they're not going to show up on any graph
E	the only alternative these people have got is just to sit in the house watching Jeremy Kyle and that's that's exactly what will happen if they
B	did you hear back from that woman?
E	who?
B	the one with the autistic son?
E	yeah
B	what?
E	oh I don't know what happened
B	did he did he go to Torquay?
E	yes but I don't know what happened to her son
B	she shouldn't be contacting you on your holiday though
E	no
A	yeah
A	yeah and then she she bought you see here
D	yep?
F	can you
C	the one with the dogs?
A	yeah
A	yeah and now have
C	yeah
A	it's like a good middle point
F	well
C	yeah you sent those to the
D	mm?

C	yeah
G	but there was

B	torrential yeah
G	yeah
C	oh that's your foot there
C	it's amazing how flexible they are isn't it?
G	I know
A	keep doing that cos when you get older you won't be able to do that any more

A	it's the same in Spanish
B	in Spain in Spain you say Jesus
A	you say Jesus you say Jesus

B	but the young kids so also in Spanish like
E	mm it's interesting that cultures which didn't have the plague still say a religious
A	yeah
B	where sneeze is still a
A	and for a long long time you'd want god to intervene interefene?
B	interfere
E	yeah but it's it's not it's just
B	interfere and intervene

C	so have our last night in Granada and then get back cos we fly into erm
B	yeah
B	Malaga?
C	Malaga yeah
B	yeah
C	mm
A	mm
B	it's really you'll see like you'll notice how Moorish it is like the architecture and the people are really dark
C	yeah
B	like loads of the music will be Arabic and gypsy
C	yep
B	couple of beers and then like you'll be full honestly
C	yeah
B	good
C	looking forward to it
B	er when we were in Granada there would be I'd order a beer and they'd put three chicken skewers full of nice chicken and that would be one one beer that cost a euro
C	that's mad innit?
A	mm
B	how can that be how can that be that would be more you'd think the chicken would be more expensive than the drink wouldn't you?
A	mm
C	yeah
A	I went on a really good I remember it was years ago but a really good walking tour in Seville so I recommend going on like a
C	really?
A	cos there's just so many amazing lovely little stories
C	yeah
A	half of Christopher Columbus is there

A	I asked the woman that and she just laughed in my face I was like I think that's a pretty legit question
C	you know if it's his head or his feet yeah you know
A	half of him's there apparently in the cathedral and they filmed
C	maybe maybe they went down the middle
A	maybe
F	oh
A	and the palace gardens is where they filmed Game of Thrones

B	in Dorn
A	no for Dorn yeah
C	yeah yeah oh
D	are you going to Granada are you?
C	yeah well it's Seville

C	June
B	you could be in Madrid by an hour if you caught the fast train
A	yeah
B	if it was too hot or whatever or if you just want a day trip or like Toledo as well
C	mm
A	if you go to Granada and you want to go to the Alhambra book it
C	yes
F	oh you've got to go to the Alhambra
A	mm

G	uhu

A	in Andalucía
B	seen those Klu Klux Klan outfits they wear?
C	yeah
B	and they parade through the street with literally a burning cross
A	we need to next year make sure that the house
B	yeah
A	cos we could make a lot of money people coming to cos our area
C	oh okay
A	so people come to see it cos they obviously can't get to Andalucía so they'll see
B	so like carry er what do you call it? what do they
C	yeah
B	you know like all men and it'll be like Jesus on the cross or they'll be people dressed a Jesus carrying the cross and whatever it's all quite solemn and there's candles or whatever it's all quite weird and they dress like the Klu Klux Klan
