A	mm
C	that's a lot of money although I saw we have a TV licence letter downstairs
A	oh really have we?
C	yeah so I don't know what we do with that?
D	as long as we don't watch live TV we're good
A	it's always TV's always on downstairs
C	is it?
A	yes
C	I don't fucking watch it
D	but generally we we only watch Netflix so and
C	yeah you
D	you do
C	but
D	twenty quid
C	between us for the year
D	I'm not getting it this year
A	yeah but what's the point in paying it for? I watch it I wouldn't it wouldn't be a loss to my life if I stopped watching it but
C	yeah
D	from now until September
C	but the other thing is they don't know the only thing is is that the living room TV is connected to an aerial and if they come in they'll go you've obviously been watching TV
A	mm
C	so that's
A	you're allowed to you're allowed to tell them no once aren't you? and then if they come back with a warrant
D	yeah cos I said no last year and then we paid it
C	yeah we paid it before he came back round
A	yeah
C	but you can stream and stuff but you can just put the laptop on or an Xbox or whatever

D	eat we eat in here generally don't we?
A	yeah I like eating either either in the kitchen or in there
D	I I never watch live TV
C	yeah you don't need it if you stream like BBC Iplayer or
A	mm a lot of the time I think though
D	I sit and watch I sit while we've been watching on demand I miss live TV I like to flip through the channels
A	mm
D	sometimes you
A	yeah I think when I just end up streaming everything or like net if we're on Netflix or whatever there's there's an odd feeling about it like it's just unlimited like I could just be sat here all day whereas yeah I don't feel like that with TV
C	yeah it's too much it's too much really
D	I was reading on erm ten ways recently erm if you've got Sky broadband if you ring them up and say you wanna cancel
