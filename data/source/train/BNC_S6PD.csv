A	when the big hand goes on seven that's your time up
B	no
A	alright? stop making a fuss I'm not asking you to eat
A	a rubber boot or anything
B	I've got a bad taste in my mouth now
A	never mind you know those children we saw on that programme who only slept in a sack?
B	don't remind me about it
A	yeah but they wouldn't make a big fuss
B	I don't want to
A	but it's important that we think of these people and
A	that not only do we try and help them but that we reflect on our own lives and how much better we off we are than lots of people and how lucky that that that makes us and how grateful we should be for food that we put er put it on the table
A	no you've had you've had twenty minutes already I think you've had plenty of time
C	I'll be checking
A	you don't need to check you don't need to
A	are you both enjoying the Simpsons?
C	yes
A	but you never laugh though do you find it funny?

A	one above the other have you
C	yeah
A	been taught that in school yet?
B	nope
C	yeah
A	have you?
[ANNOTATION]	they are not sure taught in school or not	Neutral
C	nope
A	it's there to basically act like an arrow it's kind of saying Dragons
C	so
A	or today I'm going to do the following colon and then you have a list of things so that's why it's used and do you know I did a lesson on punctuation last term for my grown-up students on apostrophes?
C	us?
A	the Simpsons
A	so
A	Homer Simpson is the full colon cos it's a kind of a big pause I think
C	yeah a big pause
A	I'll have to show you the Powerpoint presentation I did
A	Maggie Maggie is the comma cos she's the weakest pause cos she's little ah so Homer must be a full stop so I think
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about wring	Entailment
C	yeah a full stop
A	er Maggie is the comma Lisa is the semicolon that's half a colon a semi-pause colon is Bart and Homer is a full stop
B	what about erm Marge?
C	so Bart is actually the
A	well there's only four ones that I covered so I didn't mention Marge the mum get on and eat
C	so Bart is the most powerful?
A	yeah? no no Bart isn't the most powerful I mean the full stop is like the strongest punctuation mark because it stops a sentence but they all have their uses and their needs they're very important very important in writing
C	yeah
B	need to have their their cos Maggie
B	think I'll tell it afterwards I've eaten
A	well er alright stop talking so quickly
A	oh is it?
C	yeah

C	we didn't listen to it fully
A	oh are you going to be entering the five hundred word competition?
B	no
C	erm no
A	why not? you're old enough

C	six words? what er what is er what is it?
A	erm for
C	how many people bought it?
A	oh no he just wrote it like he just wrote it down because someone said I bet you can't make up a short story that short
C	mm I'd probably want to use a lot more for my story
A	if you don't like your pancake it means you've put too much maple syrup on there
B	I do like it
A	you do like it? well why are you pulling that horrible face then?
B	cos my tongue tastes rubbery

B	I thought the yogurts were chocolate mousses
C	oh I could I have my Swiss roll? kind of no chocolate
A	your Swiss roll? you can have some if you'll eat your Christmas chocolate because I'm just desperate that you eat that stuff cos it's we're in February now

C	six hours
A	yeah but it's one day driving but also it's very tiring and we it'd be nice to go to the beach when it's sunny but I would definitely like to take you guys again in the summer
C	mm
A	and obviously the weekend before so is there any?
B	my arms are really sticky here
A	I don't care that your arm is sticky that's because you've got something sticky on it isn't it?
A	well hard luck you're just gonna have to finish your pancake and then you can go and wash it
A	you had the option of washing it and you didn't want to do that so nobody else got it sticky but you
C	have I had enough cucumber?
A	you have had enough cucumber yes
C	er I'd probably
B	are you gonna use it?
A	well I just think you've
C	well we don't have that many good cardboard boxes
B	I want er I always want to do junk modelling
A	but who does?
B	receptions every single day
A	yeah but we could do it here
C	mum?
A	yes?
C	do you think this is out of date?
A	the chocolate? no
C	no
A	I think that kind of chocolate does taste funny because it's got hardly cocoa in it it's just mainly sugar
C	mm
A	and milk and various other things
C	mm
A	can you sit down
C	I'm not sure if it's out of date
A	well you don't have to eat it if you don't want it
C	mm
A	so yes do you want to go on a day trip? to
A	yes Paris can be done in a day but it costs a lot of money and also the weather in Paris is
B	why is my tongue so rubbery?
A	I don't know the Parisian weather is very similar to here so if it's cold and rainy here it'll pretty much be like that in Paris and we don't really know what the weather's gonna be like in half term but it's not going to be amazing
C	erm is Paris that was like loads of men were killed? those people were killed?
A	yes recently
A	you're you're gonna be sent to your room in a minute
B	but I'm trying to get a rubbery thing out of my tongue
A	if it's I have no idea why it's rubbery you've put maybe
B	every time I drink I get really rubbery and it tastes of
A	don't drink it then don't drink
C	yeah that's why
A	that's why? for the Eiffel Tower?
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	I love it it's so er clever it was really quickly built
A	mm it is impressive it's nice to see Paris from that height as well
C	not like the
A	oh I like the Shard
C	yeah but that took ages
A	well it's more complicated I suppose
C	mm the Leaning Tower of Pisa isn't and that took years and years
A	mm that well that is pretty complicated
C	did it take
A	but that was from earlier
C	two thousand years?
A	no I think it's Renaissance it might be slightly older than that so about six hundred years I reckon
B	mama
A	and the Eiffel Tower's about two hundred a hundred and fifty years
B	I've got a joke about that
A	you I'm not gonna hear anything
A	no you're not gonna tell me cos you're gonna eat your pancake
A	six hundred darling six hundred not six thousand
C	oh yeah
A	we haven't heard any more in the news about that Anglo-Saxon site that they're excavating in
C	mum are the colour's still there?
A	what colours?
C	you know in the mosaic? well I'm thinking of something else
A	oh but the mosaics that I showed you?
C	yeah
A	yeah the colours were still there because they er they were buried so but mosaics are made of kind of painted and glazed tiles so they're yeah they're pretty much gonna stay the colours that they were they might fade a little bit but not too much
C	I think I'd be quite good at making mosaics
A	mm
B	ah
A	pretend Roman ones
C	how big are the squares?
A	oh tiny kind of like
C	oh
A	and you can break them up you can cut them if you've got special tools to make them smaller
