A	the David Cameron one's like really like the
B	oh the news scares me too much to even
A	oh
B	look at it like I do look at it but
A	I know cos I just like up until now I haven't really even been paying attention and I feel like this may be a time to get on board with it cos I dunno
B	I didn't think
A	cos people are gonna be talking about it a lot and I feel like I wanna actually
B	like if this if this is a
A	not just be spouting bullshit about it you know
B	yeah
A	like
B	mm
A	what? what were you saying?
B	I can't remember
B	I was leading on from what you were just saying like I was just tagging
A	oh
A	good
B	I I agree with you
B	a lot
A	I dunno
B	or is it unexplicit like we are at war?
A	yeah probably
B	directly affected
A	you know doing it
B	yeah
A	but I mean some of England's er are over there like
B	oh we've had bombings
A	fighting
B	and yeah
A	erm but I mean it would have to be like a direct thing I reckon like we would literally have to get bombed or there would have to be like a terror attack in London or somewhere to make it seem like
B	can you imagine that? just
A	oh my god we're actually at war with these people like
B	that would be horrendous
A	it would be I'm just really lucky I don't have any relatives who live in
B	I do
A	do you? oh
B	well I've got one but I think he's not there at the moment I think he's
A	yeah
B	cos he went to erm the Philippines
A	mm
B	he's got a flat there still but he's still he spends most of his time in the Philippines but still it must be so scary to live in
A	yeah
B	like
A	yeah I remember my aunty lived in
B	yeah
A	stuff happened
B	mm
A	I was like really scared all the time for her
B	because how when they've
A	don't really know
B	a thing? but no like yeah
A	mm
B	erm
A	mm so maybe twenty-fourteen I suppose
B	really? it's that recent?
A	mm
B	yeah
A	started to like gained erm
B	some sort of yeah
A	yeah them
B	it's just monstrous it's
A	mm
B	horrible like it's
A	it really is
B	it's unspeakable really
A	so what are Jihadists then? I'm really confused
B	I don't even understand
B	I I'd assume Jihadists are like
B	so basically they're people that murder
A	that use erm
B	religion as
A	religion to
B	an excuse to
A	yeah
B	glorify yeah
A	to murder innocent people
B	wow
A	bloody hell
B	jesus christ what is?
A	mm
B	oh
A	bad thing which is
B	we need to stop them breeding
A	Islamic State yeah
B	like cos they're gonna brainwash their children
A	er they already are like it's scary like there are some bits of footage that I've seen on the news from time to time of like children up in like
B	they
A	up in the gun nest thing with like the machine guns like just sitting there like watching as they're like
B	and the sad thing is when we attack them the children are gonna get killed aren't they?
A	yeah and it's not their fault
B	and how about like
B	wives and cos I'm sure there's gonna be people there who just don't agree with it you know?
A	mm
B	but they are just there out of fear
A	yeah
B	it's very sad it's really sad
A	oh that sounded really painful
B	yeah it wasn't painful it was just very
A	very jesus
B	very jesus
A	a great deal welcome the prospect of direct confrontation with the US led coalition viewing it as a harbinger of end of times showdown between
B	those graphics looks terrible
A	I know
B	but it is scary it's just
A	it's scary that it's real like
B	mm
A	like this kind of the
B	this is real life
A	this is happening in real life like
B	this is real yeah
A	it's really terrifying
B	but this isn't something that's happening in a film
A	no
B	this is real
A	I think they've already banned that film coming out in Turkey
B	what the
A	The Hunger Games film
B	really?
A	yeah cos it's coming out this week and it's been banned or something
B	what's it what's in it that's so bad? is it just the idea of?
A	it's the same sort of thing as this really like propaganda and rebellion and shit and they obviously don't like that
B	no yeah
A	and in China as well
B	oh god
A	because China's like that
B	is this in regards to this week's events?
A	yeah well not just this week's events
B	oh just
A	in general like
B	yeah just in general
A	the tone of the film like and how it relates to what's happening at the moment
B	mm
A	it's not like you're reading a book and that it's like oh my god this is actually what life is like at the moment
A	oh
B	that is what scares me like
A	beheading no that's not
B	the men in the orange suits
A	natural to behead someone you know? like
B	it's a medieval punishment isn't it?
A	yeah it really is it is
B	you know it's not real like it's not humane
A	it isn't
B	and the way they just get their it's like samurai swords or whatever
A	mm yeah
B	and it's like ah
A	and they're proper machetes they've got
B	mm
A	it's just oh
B	it's horrendous can I put my phone on charge on your little?
A	yeah
B	oh
A	oh no it's been it's been going for longer than that actually
B	how long?
A	it's saying here two thousand and six
B	oh god
A	so that's almost ten years
B	wow but it's not really come into prominence until like
A	no
B	the
A	no until recently
B	I don't think it's till recently people have started to get really afraid of it you know?
A	mm
B	yeah
A	that's really got people spooked
B	I wouldn't ever go to Syria
A	no
B	I wouldn't dare
A	I wouldn't
B	wow
A	mm yeah it is
B	I mean do you think they can win potentially?
A	erm
B	er
A	er
B	not that oh I just
A	I mean up until now like their tactics like the way they've been carrying out these terror attacks has been extremely successful you know? like nobody has been caught well no they have been caught but after they've happened like after they've succeeded in killing a whole bunch of people
B	mm
A	erm
B	well they're not really giving us another choice are they?
A	no exactly they're not
B	cos they won't rationalise
A	gonna like repent or anything like that
B	and I guess it gets to the point where it's like it's almost necessary
A	yeah
B	because it's killing the lives of so many people that
A	it's such an emotional thing isn't it?
B	that are gonna die
B	mm
A	just like carry on
B	yeah I know it's a tough one
A	well then again it isn't because they're fucking murderers and like
A	they don't deserve
B	no they can't they can't
B	exactly they can't
A	or humanity
B	yeah
A	if they don't give any of that to other people or
B	and if war on war has to be the thing that is the last thing alternative
A	mm
B	you know you've gotta you've gotta do it haven't you? but
A	mm
B	how has it got to this point? I don't understand
A	I mean I'd like to think that with everyone together like
B	yeah there's more of us
A	we'll be able to overcome that yeah
B	we outnumber
A	yeah
B	them but
A	mm and if we've got America as well
B	I mean how I know it sounds silly but how do how would they have even thought that they had a chance at the beginning of it? like it's like this is a whole country this is a whole like who has this sense of like believing that they're so big that they can overrule like
A	mm
B	like do they want is that their goal? to like rule us all? and just be like
A	mm
A	yeah that it'll be that sort of to their religion
B	because I'm sorry we're not having
A	and in fact they welcome conflict cos they see it as
B	oh
B	what so they see this as like the end kind of thing?
A	mm mm
B	so they're not actually trying to restore anything they're just like this we're gonna cause the end of the world?
A	erm pretty much yeah
B	that doesn't make any fucking sense
A	no it doesn't
B	it's like we want you to be good and believe in our god like
A	you just just wonder how many hostages they have
B	yeah
A	I dunno
B	oh
A	mm
B	what would happen?
A	fuck knows
B	or you know someone significant like can you imagine?
A	mm
B	like say it wasn't like just a journalist
B	if they took the royal family hostage
A	yeah
B	I mean there'd be a huge uproar about that
A	what in the UK?
B	mm
A	well I dunno
B	I mean they could bomb the capital city or a city but they couldn't like go everywhere straightaway
A	why not?
B	er not all at once right?
A	well they've got how many have they got? two hundred thousand people on their side
B	well
B	is that how many soldiers or how many people supporting it?
A	erm I don't really know but I mean considering the fact that they kind of have this attitude to it like where like the apocalypse so they're willing to sacrifice themselves and they're willing to be suicide bombers like you had in France
B	you are
A	in however many years like the France attacks and whatever comes after this
B	god jesus christ I can't imagine what's gonna come after this
A	I dunno well I mean it's not getting better
B	like I can't think about like studies and shit now like what does it even matter?
A	mm
B	what does it matter?
A	I know
B	here I am like
A	you shouldn't let this like stop you from
B	no but it's just distracting isn't it? like
A	no it really is
B	it er inconvenience to my studies how selfish is that? but just like
A	mm
B	it's so like it everything just seems so trivial now doesn't it really?
A	mm
B	I know
A	I don't know
B	cos it's just like oh it's scary
A	but can you just imagine how easy it would be for like an Isis person to go into a tube erm with like a bomb belt and detonate it on the tube? like there's no security in tube stations like that
B	what in London?
A	they'd have no way of knowing would they? yeah in London
B	yeah
A	and then that could just spiral into what what's happened in France
B	god that would be terrifying
A	mm
B	what you mean do it in the station or do it on the train?
A	on the train
B	oh god
A	either way it's
B	that would be horrible
A	there's no security is there?
B	no there isn't
A	there's just this turnstile and that's it
B	well nobody checks you over yeah
A	yeah but it doesn't check you over does it?
B	that's what I said
A	no no
B	and that's what's gonna happen
A	I mean they probably have metal detectors but I don't know it's just gonna be like I don't think it would be impossible for them to do that
B	no
A	and they have people living here remember like they have accomplices all over the world I expect
B	yeah
A	it's the wealthiest militant group
B	really?
A	mm
B	how do they get their money though? funded by the
A	mostly private donors and Islamic charities
B	oh my fucking god who is fucking donating to these fucking charities?
A	several million dollars a week
B	it does
A	every time
B	oil
A	and the kidnapping
B	really?
A	mm
B	that's
A	oh just where?
B	it's that's there
A	oh
B	is that an article or? oh yeah
A	it's just extra bit
B	it's just
A	it's just so extreme you know? like how can someone believe that so it's almost like they're I dunno like
B	they can't honestly believe
A	they're just mentally disturbed or something
B	yeah
A	I don't wanna bring mental illness into it cos that's not fair but just to be able to think that way and be okay with it like with just killing people
B	I know
A	mm
B	spark
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	and everyone would be absolute hysterics and it would just not be you wouldn't be able to function or anything like this like you wonder whether they're kind of holding back from saying that
B	just think if
A	that we're at war because they don't wanna create panic
B	do you think erm how many suicides er would if we were told our country was at war?
A	yeah
B	again
A	I mean but how many suicides were there in in the second world war and the first world war? not
B	I think though with this generation I think everybody would just be like
A	yeah
B	that's it we're fucked
A	yeah yeah
B	basically
A	mm
B	maybe that's just me but I see it as a safeish place compared to most other places
A	no to be honest it's always
B	mm
A	in the world
B	yeah
A	you know like England
B	mm
A	America those Russia those sort of places
B	yeah
A	cos they're so rich I mean well we're a huge amount of debt but we were rich
B	mm we were rich once
A	we were
B	that was a long time ago but it happened once
A	mm
B	it's weird though cos when I imagine terrorism like our country being attacked by terrorists I imagine like right now where
A	mm
B	I mean it's just like oh god it's like that would be my worst like you know I I'd cry so much I mean it's just like
A	what would you do? would you like play dead or you just let them kill you?
B	I don't know I I couldn't I couldn't I wouldn't know I don't know how people act in these situations and how they survive it's just crazy
A	there was a thing on Facebook about a girl who was in the concert hall
B	yes
A	and she like she lied down and played dead
B	the one with the
A	for an hour
B	she posted a
A	mm yeah
B	her T shirt up or something yeah
A	yeah
B	that was incredible
A	I know
B	how did she
A	mm
B	they weren't just yeah
A	yeah I mean there's there's no guarantee that you would like stay alive after that even if you did try and like play dead like cos people know that they do that now don't they I think
B	no
A	I probably would
B	you just freeze
A	be the first one that got shot to be honest
B	in those situations
A	I'd just be just sort of yeah
A	so maybe don't go to
B	no
A	I mean to be honest like
B	yeah
A	and we're like near the sea and you know
B	they could come in to land just like yeah
B	they could come to
A	they could they could but it's I mean it's highly
B	that would be a pretty shit entrance wouldn't it?
A	like it's highly unlikely
B	yeah
B	mm
A	any more than you do I'm just kind of a negative person anyway
B	it feels very negative
A	and it does feel like an imminent threat because of what happened in Paris
B	I mean I guess you could look at it in the way that like you know those bomb attacks in London?
A	mm
B	here we are how many years later? and the world's not collapsed even though things are pretty bad like we've not
A	yeah
B	not had our country taken over by them
A	no
B	I think we're all yeah
A	no no I don't I don't think we would be overpowered by Islamic State
A	if they were to attack London or somewhere
B	mm I think oh I dunno like how would we control it? we'd get people with guns and shit but that's
A	I mean England's too strong and we have too many allies and yeah it I don't think it would come to that
B	mm
A	and also like they like spontaneity and if they attack London straight after when we're expecting them to attack us which we are now kind of like there will be a threat level thing and everyone will be aware that like
B	that's the thing
A	there's a high threat
B	we'll all be alert to it
A	yes exactly
B	so it's
A	so they're unlikely to do it now they would wanna do it when it's all died down like in like in Paris like months and months after the first
B	cos nobody was expecting that bloody hell
A	no exactly like nobody was expecting it at all
B	and when you think Friday the thirteenth you don't think Paris do you?
A	yeah I do wonder though
B	what? Friday the thirteenth?
A	yeah to like be really
B	is that a thing over there?
A	well
A	but I am wondering it could be
B	I mean they could know it was a thing over here
A	yeah
B	and try and scare the shit out of us
A	cos that was a lot of shit that happened on Friday it wasn't just Paris
B	yeah
A	like Japan had a couple of earthquakes erm what was it? Beirut
B	oh
B	he's never actually bumped into us
B	no
A	because they're not religious like that oh jesus
B	is that like another word for erm
A	mm could be
B	no because people are
A	people are so willing to join up and it's just
B	why?
A	mind boggling I don't know
B	that is very worrying
A	yeah
B	it's just scary isn't it?
A	mm
B	Abu Bakr
A	yeah
B	al-Baghdadi
A	mm
B	yeah
A	see that's what they were
B	yeah preparing for battle
A	yeah they're just running into it really aren't they? like
B	like think about what you're doing
A	jesus
B	but then I guess well you have to act but then
A	yeah
B	you just don't know what how to act so
A	they need to catch them they need to use mm mm
B	cos they're not all in the same place
A	no
B	I can imagine it's rather difficult
A	and there are so many of them like they need to kill the leader
B	yeah they do
A	mm
B	you need to kill the
B	that is yeah but there's like a
A	yeah there is
B	in an ant colony you need to kill the main one and then all the surrounding ones will
A	I'd love to work for MI5 that would be so cool
B	you get paid a lot for that
A	I know
B	I wonder how much
A	my sister made an internship with them
B	really?
A	mm
B	would she be able to tell anybody?
A	erm yeah cos er you don't get to do all the fun stuff
B	er I work at MI5
A	so cool
B	I wonder like cos
A	they only have four thousand staff that's not very many
B	no it's not
B	well you can imagine like how many people would be able to keep a secret?
A	mm it's true are you MI5 ready?
B	what sort of stuff do you have to do to be in MI5 like?
A	I have no idea
B	is it a bit like Dr Who?
A	it's more like James Bond
B	yeah
A	like did
B	yeah
A	did you mean that instead of Dr Who?
B	well
A	or nothing to do with MI5
B	well er obviously no but I meant as in like all the computery stuff and solving saving the world kind of thing like yeah
A	oh well mm not really
B	oh
A	it have you seen James Bond?
B	yes I
A	it's it's like James Bond
