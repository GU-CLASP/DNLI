A	just to make sure this is I think that's okay it's recording okay so
B	yes well the reason for personal shopping was because my daughter's getting married in December
A	mm
B	and erm wanted an outfit as the mother of the bride but I really don't want to stand out in front of anyone else I I don't don't I just hate that sort of thing
C	yes
B	and
A	sister-in-law
B	sister-in-law yeah but not actually
A	right
B	so she's she's
A	oh right
B	so the three of us went off and I was not you know I thought it was really nice of her to do this
A	mm
B	but actually it wasn't what I wanted and I'd want to shop by myself not with two two friends that are going to say this is lovely and then hate because I should be should be in a bright colour or whatever and I don't
C	yes
B	anyway I'd started out and have you ever been to a personal shopper?
A	no no I haven't
C	well I've had very few occasions to actually get dressed up erm I mean one niece's wedding and that's basically it but my son is engaged has just got engaged
B	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B likes shopping with other people.	Contradiction
A	oh
C	so so there is going to be a wedding coming up so this is of great interest to me your experience
B	well I think it's a really good thing to do and I wouldn't have done it eh on my own or even contemplated it because I'd never think anybody else is going to know really what I want to dress in
C	yes
B	but erm so when? there no date's been set?
C	they haven't set a date it might even be two thousand and sixteen
B	yeah yeah
C	but erm one of the things that's quite daunting is that it's going to be in
B	oh crikey
B	how does that come about?
[ANNOTATION]	The wedding will be made in a salle.	Neutral
C	erm because that's where her family eh go
B	oh
C	and in fact although erm
C	because of course they must get hundreds of requests to get married in
B	I'm sure I'm sure but if you have an attachment to I think
C	yes yes
B	oh and you believe him?
C	yes I've heard them at least once I think in
B	yeah well so
C	yes
B	er
[ANNOTATION]	It's not easy to book the place for the wedding.	Entailment
C	aha
C	mm mm I mean we knew the
[ANNOTATION]	The couple will get married in another province.	Neutral
B	did you?
C	mm
B	oh right okay so where where do you come from?
C	well we were living in
B	I came from
C	do you?
B	yes well not really but I was er brought up abroad and then when I was fifteen er fourteen actually we came back to
A	as was yes yes
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B did not grow up at the current place.	Entailment
B	and erm so in those days not like today where you you know you perhaps move around or don't move around schools you'd still drive in from here through to
A	yeah
B	but erm every time we moved we moved to the local school so you know I had about ten schools actually but erm yeah so we moved out to
C	aha yeah
B	and that's where I lived for a while and then got married so er and then came out this way because
A	yes yes yes mm mm
B	yes let's do that ah as I say not happy to have done it really but erm because they organised it friends organised it I thought well I'll just have to go along
A	mm
B	and eh I just really trussed myself up in something that was going to try and hold me in a little bit erm and the lady came in and as you say you have this personal erm you know cubicle which is big enough for all of us to sit down
C	yes
B	but erm so we sat down and she was very good the person who was doing it was very good she listened erm she said what colour would you like? and I said black because it's just my favourite colour to dress
A	yes yes
B	so I wore a shift dress and that's what I'm happiest in is a shift dress of any kind black sequin evening whatever erm so she said black hmm and I said well I can dress it up with a lovely necklace or whatever er and a little coat or something like a jacket but my favourite would be black anyway she went away and she duly brought a little black dress which was the first thing to try on and there were other colours erm a bright a teal blue which in fact suited me I never knew it would do or never thought it would do but it did but it was just like a carnival dress it just was not me so ah but the black dress was an instant fit I just she just had my figure straight away and I thought I've never look so good in a black dress ah anyway but she said no no you can't do that for mother of the bride that's a no no so erm that was put aside and I said but I'll buy it as my little black dress so it was put aside for me it was the first one I tried that she brought in erm then another
A	can I just interrupt a second? do do you like builder's tea? or do you want earl grey or something fancy?
B	builder's tea
C	yes builder's is
B	sugar?
B	yeah no sugar
A	milk? you put your own milk in that be okay?
C	that would be fine
A	sorry to interrupt yeah so the next dress
B	and eh so the next dress was a there was a red one and I'm good with red but it just didn't really do anything and I kept wanting to go back to the black dress
A	mm
B	anyway she moved on to the other two
A	I was going to say so yes
C	were they? were they inputting comments and was that satisfactory? or was that?
B	erm yes I I think I'd have preferred to do one one on one but actually erm yeah they were saying that looks lovely or that looks lovely and they liked the teal
C	yeah
B	well I still felt overdressed
C	mm
B	so erm although everyone seemed to like that the best it was not for me
C	mm
B	eh anyway we she moved onto these two and seven dresses were brought out and
B	anyway I have never seen her look so beautiful in a dress it was just just perfect figure for
C	right
B	erm and so I thought well she'll just have to have this and so she is wearing that little
B	this shared dress but erm
A	how much milk did you say?
B	oh that's fine thank you and then erm she brought in some other clothes for them
C	yep lovely
B	and one of them was a jumpsuit and as soon as it came off the rack I said I can I try that? just stuck up my hand straight away and said can I have that? so I put it on and I felt fine that was for me and it's a jumpsuit with very
A	jumpsuit?
B	yep so I'm wearing long which is what the mother mother-in-law is wearing
C	right
B	and other people can wear long that would be lovely erm but it's it's long but of course it's wide legged
C	yes right
B	so it is like a long dress but it is definitely it's
C	mm
B	and it has a
C	oh right
B	so I just thought I I hung about in it in the dressing room for quite a while and I thought still shows a bit of a tummy though so I need to do a bit more work in the diet sort of thing but erm I
C	fantastic thank you yes yes
B	so
C	I mean funny that you mention teal because those sorts of bluey greeny colours I would always sort of you know everything that I wore for work was around those sorts of colours
B	yeah well you've got green eyes green blue eyes
C	erm that yeah
B	it was it was beautiful
A	well it
B	no
A	it's just she put it on me and
B	actually your hair colour you know I think has something to do with it
A	I don't know
B	so you know
C	mm
B	erm but this was fussy yours wasn't actually it just it was a really nice
B	but this was actually but you know those erm ribbon
A	oh yeah
C	yes yeah
B	it's one of those yeah but you know it just
B	and then they went up in a fee just
C	no yes yes
B	actually I felt like a fish I did
C	oh yes that is a really nice colour
B	yes yeah no it isn't
A	and it isn't it wasn't fashionable particularly cos it was really difficult to get shoes that colour
B	no but the length of it is beautiful
C	yes yes
A	oh I don't know it's not a dress I'd have looked at
B	what size shoes do you fit?
A	erm six and a half to seven
B	oh no good
A	why?
B	but I'm not having a teal dress anyway but eh those were beautiful shoes
A	yeah and luckily they were half price
B	mm
A	and I bought them two days before
C	did you get shoes as well then?
B	no I didn't I again I took erm shoes with a erm a heel which I could hardly walk around in
C	mm
B	but actually the erm jumpsuit leg length hem length erm was just brushing the ground on that so I am going to have to get a proper pair of shoes that are that high but comfortable
C	mm mm
B	so erm
A	that's not easy
B	it's not easy no
A	cos I couldn't I was terrified how I was going to walk in the shoes
B	or have them taken up in that yeah mm
A	mm
B	but you are also outside in the grass so you have to
C	I mean I
A	no it's in the gravel as well
B	mm
A	cos you sink in gravel
B	yeah
A	mm
C	I mean years ago people used to wear high heels didn't we have to wear high heels to work and look at them
A	yeah mm
C	i've got one pair I still have and I look at them and think this is ridiculous
A	mm
B	well I
A	do you do you wear high heels now? you don't know
A	no
B	I do but not
A	mm mm
C	mm
B	but it's the erm I think as
A	casual clothes or
B	casual erm what do you call them? I like to call them tackys erm
C	flatties I suppose are they?
B	mm
A	what do you mean trainers?
B	trainers trainers you know erm well
C	oh mm
A	flatties
C	yeah
B	yes yeah but erm your arches go down every time so actually you cannot get them back up to the you know difficult over time so you get
C	mm
C	it's a fashion thing too isn't it? I mean my daughter doesn't wear high heels
B	mm
C	I don't think very many of them do except for
B	mm
C	a very special occasions so they don't wear them on a daily basis like we used to at that age
B	mm
A	no
B	actually
A	mm
B	she's on stilettos she's still
A	she's not
C	mm
A	but so many people of our age group now have got bunions and things from wearing stilettos and goodness knows what
C	yes yes
B	mm
C	but apparently there is now a school of thought which says that's nothing to do with the shoes you wear it's genetic
B	really?
A	oh really?
C	mm
B	really?
C	mm
B	mm
A	interesting what did you do in your work? erm your career?
C	erm well well I I wasn't erm I didn't follow through the linguistic side erm but no I was a university careers adviser
A	oh really?
C	mm mm so until last summer I was at
A	oh were you?
C	been there for twenty-three years
A	oh really?
C	mm
A	gosh
C	mm
A	wow we should have known you when our children were dithering not making decisions
C	yeah
B	and did they make the same
C	sorry?
B	I wonder if they made the
C	no not at all my eldest didn't
C	mm
B	so yeah
C	mm
C	yes
A	so
B	we probably have I I did come away thinking you know how you still feel the event is that massive or you are that big in that particular event or
C	yes yes
B	erm I came away thinking yep I'll have it and that's my back up but actually I'll probably wear it I want to wear it I just
A	did you find it at all sort of erm threatening having other people there with you? would you have rather
B	no not threatening erm I er
A	or discomforting?
B	I wasn't I didn't actually look forward to it maybe discomforting yeah not at the time though cos it was a bit of fun with all three of us er but I knew really that
C	yes yes
B	so
A	and are you going to wear anything on your head? are you?
B	no I I just feel I've got fine hair and as soon as I put a hat on or anything that it just just you know it just flattens it's yeah silly
C	flattens it yeah mm mm
B	so I may may just get a little diamante something or other
A	cos this this woman who made my
B	really?
A	and eh she's really nice we go to her house and I thought she would you know cost a fortune and it was thirty quid
C	well
B	really?
A	mm she was amazing it's the second time she's done it for me
B	well
A	I kind of recommend her in a way cos you can go to her and
B	mm
A	just show her what you're wearing and she'll she she's you know there were these people coming in and taking away stuff that was going to be worn by obviously very special people
B	mm wow
A	agents or whatever they are shops and erm and and I saw a few cheques written out for much more money than she was charging me about six times as much
B	wow gosh
A	but she's she's into it not just for the money so if you're just a sort of person off the street
B	well for me I mean it's an evening do so I'm not going to be wearing a hat or a
A	no
B	you know yeah
A	so it's just shoes now?
B	it is just shoes and a nice little clutch bag I think erm oh no and a jacket cos I can't you know you'd have to have a
unknown_female	oh
B	which I didn't realise till I was taking it off I thought
C	yes yeah
A	did they not suggest a jacket
B	no well this was the very end and we'd been there from nine A.M
A	oh they they were being dressed as well
B	yeah they were being dressed and they bought the well
C	mm
A	oh right I didn't realise the other three were buying as well
B	yes yeah
C	so that means the hour is the standard what you book is it's an hour is it?
A	yes
C	mm
B	but to be honest if you find a dress
A	yes
B	had the knack but erm
A	this was John Lewis
B	this was John Lewis yeah yeah mm
C	mm yeah
A	that's very promising actually
B	it is the other thing I was thinking was I didn't really want another reason for not really wanting to do this was erm I knew that John Lewis in in
C	yes yes
A	or Diana Tout and
B	so I knew what they were going to show me were either a
A	yes yes
C	mm that's a slight worry
A	I think that was my fear as well
B	yeah
A	that's why I wanted it made
B	cos Phase Eight is a popular erm label over all the generations even younger people so I am a little bit worried about this
C	mm
A	yes yes no cos you'll personalise it so
B	well I'll have a
C	mm yeah so what sort of finish is that going to be? what sort of fabric would that be?
B	it'd be better if it were satin I think to give it some kind of a lift for the evening
A	mm and what colour?
B	and so if you've got
A	cos you could do
A	oh right yeah sorry I was thinking it was all black
B	yeah erm mm so probably black you don't have one do you?
A	but you could sell one quite easily
B	could I?
A	or I could help you I mean I'd have thought it's like the the sort of
B	yeah well I was going to go downstairs and go to but I don't know how much
A	they're probably cheaper than you can make them for
C	yeah yes cos it's really just a pleated fabric isn't it?
B	mm that's something
A	pleated? would it be pleated?
C	I imagine it as being pleated
A	I'm thinking of a sort of straight satin band around
C	yes I mean pleated in a sort of horizontal sense
B	it is yeah they are actually
A	are they?
B	yeah
A	but you can have them just plain can't you? or do you want? oh that makes it a bit more complicated doesn't it for sowing
B	mm mm
A	what? actual pleats flapping over and going round?
B	well that's what I imagine
C	I've yeah well I've seen them with pleats and I've seen them with er soft pleating
A	mm yes
C	as if it's one thing but folds
A	yes yes oh right
B	mm I need to investigate that and a jacket and shoes and a clutch bag mm
A	so you're all sorted?
B	yeah
A	that's a huge relief oh have another biscuit you'll be fine
C	the only time I've really gone to buy anything was as I said for my niece's wedding and erm my daughter's very good actually I mean she understands me perfectly and she'll say just try it on
B	and you're looking
C	oh no I don't think so mother just try it on
A	mm yeah right eh
A	I think yeah I think it must be twenty minutes now erm
