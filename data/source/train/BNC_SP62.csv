A	they're very
B	mm
A	very sensible
C	oh I think they will be
B	mm
C	I think they will
A	I now I thought when you were with the other woman
C	the other thing
A	right? When you were with her
A	I mean I thought that her daughter would actually lead
C	no
A	you don't think so? I thought she would've
B	both
A	yeah but I meant when
B	can see a lot of
A	when you're
B	they always have done haven't they
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah but when you're
A	when you're with somebody and you don't  and you don't  want to be yes it's like them bully er if you like
C	yeah
A	yes
C	when I told when I cos
A	that's right
B	mm
A	yeah
C	because of the way they are
B	mm
C	and then
B	mm
A	no
C	I said this is the way  this is the way  these are the boundaries that are in
A	that's right
C	mm
A	yeah
C	I says and that's part of the that's the the problem
B	mm
A	well
C	I don't think she will
A	Don't you think she
C	no
A	can see it?
C	no
A	well no
C	yeah
A	this is what they do
C	yeah
A	it's horrible ain't it
C	mm
A	the way youngsters in that type of environment go
C	yeah
A	horrible thought
C	you know
A	mhm
C	now Easton's fine
A	no
C	er but they moved to Taverham
A	no
C	now
B	mm
C	as as they did
A	no
C	because they're
A	what they are
C	what you
A	yeah
C	what you've
B	mm
C	what you've got
A	yeah
C	now sometimes you can't you're in that position where you can't get out of that
A	well that's right
B	mm
A	yeah
C	you know
A	I mean my brother actually lives in Bowthorpe
C	you know
A	he bought the house yonks ago
C	yeah
A	worse
B	mm
A	there
C	yeah
A	no
C	at this point in time
A	not at this particular time
B	mm
A	no
C	you know
B	yeah
C	around her
A	yeah
B	oh
C	so
A	I mean er
C	they're they're becoming certain certain roads will become the the roads that
A	no go areas and stuff
C	the the roads that are not owner-occupied
A	yeah
C	dare I say it
B	mm
C	are the areas that have that problem
A	yeah
B	mm
C	Cos people don't care about you know
A	they just don't care about their environment
B	yeah
A	or nothing
C	and and it does appear that even the housing associations don't put that much emphasis into those areas where they should be
A	no
C	if you're just a normal person who hasn't got any young children anything like that they don't wanna know
A	no
C	they just get by
A	yeah
B	mm
C	you know
A	no
C	you know
B	yeah
C	I don't er
A	that's such a shame though about I mean the government and and the powers that be knew what they were doing when they put all these houses cheek to cheek and jowl by jowl
C	well
A	yeah
C	so we'll get rid of the back to
B	mm
C	but we'll give you a tower block
A	yeah
C	how many
A	well that's right
C	when they can walk out their door?
A	yeah
B	mm
C	give me the back-to-back houses
B	mm
A	yeah
C	right? And if you look at the modern estates now they're no different to the back-to-back houses
A	no they're not
C	at all
A	no
C	you've just got a
A	mm
C	bit more garden or you're you've got a nice a bigger
A	yeah
C	yeah I know where you mean
A	and down Marlpit Lane you got all those flats
C	yeah
A	and helped people out when they were ill
C	mm
A	many cars about then
C	it wasn't just that though was it
A	well they just wanted to destroy the community
C	no
B	mhm
C	if you think where where they
A	yeah
C	it's industrial units or
A	yeah
C	so they can charge a premium for
A	yeah
B	mm
A	yeah
C	mm
A	run out and get it in for them
C	but society changed then didn't it
A	yeah
C	who who made that? Who changed that society?
A	well I think the sixities have got a lot to  lot to  to to do with it
C	mm
A	and the tower blocks didn't have any they er people were locked in their little cell
C	in their little box
A	and and when they came out onto the communal staircases they were awful concrete places where they were all dark and horrible
C	just dark and dismal
A	there was no lifts
C	the lifts didn't er lifts hardly worked
B	yeah
C	or they were vandalized
A	yeah
C	and then people'd pee in the corridors and stuff like that
A	that's it
B	yeah
A	and then start sleeping in the corridors
B	mm
A	oh
C	I remember the where I used to live they built a tower block on what was called Sladefield Road Secondary Modern
C	Cos
A	yeah
C	and then further up was the secondary modern school
A	yeah
C	well just with Birmingham changing how it changed they built Washwood Heath Comprehensive
A	went to the comprehensive
C	went to the comprehensive
A	yeah
B	mm
C	and that was the
A	yeah yeah your yeah
C	all those things
A	mm
C	I'll have to see whether it's still there matter of fact on Google Earth
A	oh that's strange that they they create huge no go areas in different cities
C	well they in Birmingham they did this they did Chelmsley Wood and Castle Vale
A	no?
C	they have knocked it down
A	oh right
C	alright? Castle Bromwich
C	school got burnt down a few times
B	oh dear
C	because it was so bad
B	huh
A	yeah
C	and er
A	mm
C	talk about this
A	was there? Yeah
C	and they've put them back to houses and stuff like that
A	yeah
C	so
B	mm
A	well people do need their own space don't they
C	mm
B	mm
A	they need their own space
C	well it's keeping the people down though isn't it
A	that is keeping the people down
B	mm
A	yeah
C	you know why did Margaret Thatcher open up selling the council houses?
A	well that's true
C	social housing
A	social housing now
C	but why?
A	and that's all privatized ain't it
C	yeah
A	it's
C	but why do they do it?
A	I dunno
C	because if you've got a mortgage and you're putting money in you've got to continue to work so going on strike makes no difference does it
B	yeah
A	you can't strike if you've got a mortgage
C	you know
B	mm
C	so we can control the people this way by
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	hm
C	we get money for it
A	they gotta buy furniture
B	mm
A	and they gotta then they gotta
C	so we'll do this therefore we get money in to er so we can do things with it
A	yeah
B	mm
C	and why  and why  are the government going back to this is your education you've gotta have this?
A	yeah
C	because it controls certain factions of the population
B	mm
A	yep
C	so vocational courses for people with hands-on experience
A	yeah
C	can't have that
C	because that gives them that independence that they can earn
B	mm
A	yeah
C	you know
A	but then there's the other the
C	yeah
A	governments
C	you only want certain people to have the to know those rights though don't you
A	yeah
C	and er which people do you want? The people in the upper
A	yeah
C	of the classes
A	the ones that will become politicians
C	yeah
A	and the ones that will become doctors
C	yeah
A	that will become
B	mm
A	yeah
C	if you look at it
A	give them a good living
C	yeah
A	and keep the  keep the  workers down
C	yeah
A	yes
C	so that means that you could be working one area of the country and earning more than somebody doing the same job somewhere else
A	that's right
C	isn't that back to how it used to be a long long time ago?
A	yeah
A	right? They owned a
C	mhm
A	getting half the pay
C	mm
A	well that's true
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	there's a good six thousand pound on teacher's salary in London
A	yeah
B	mm
A	but that don't do them any good do it?
B	no
A	because
C	Cos the prices down there are
C	yeah
B	mm
C	yeah
B	isn't it
A	well er why? That doesn't cost London council any more than our councils to you know the the
C	there's a need isn't it
A	there's a supply and
B	yeah
A	demand
C	that's what it comes down to
B	people want the houses
B	they don't want the ones up in Yorkshire and Derbyshire so much do they
A	well
B	mm
A	yeah
C	some nice houses for sale in Yorkshire at the moment
A	we saw a nice place for sale in Glenridding didn't we
B	I didn't like it
A	you didn't like it no
B	no
A	but it had five
B	you want a better house than that
A	five bedrooms for  for the for  the people that lived there
B	yeah
A	in this
C	where about?
A	great big house
B	mm

A	and that was on er that had beautiful view of
B	oh of yeah

A	well you could do if er as soon as you put them on
B	if

C	a lot easier
A	yeah
C	but I always rather than I always give them a name so like
A	to the folder?

A	yeah?
C	so Lakes O nine for instance
A	yeah
B	mm
