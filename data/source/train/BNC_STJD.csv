B	cut it off cut it off That's so good
A	that makes me feel sick
C	mm
B	really?
A	mm
C	really?
A	yeah
B	this has gotta be quite old
C	yeah cos she doesn't look like that any more
B	yeah
A	I think because of the hair extensions I don't think it's real hair even though it is
B	it is real though
C	ah yeah
B	is it real hair though? Yeah
C	Cos you haven't actually seen it come off a person
A	yeah
B	shiny face
C	are they gonna do things to her eyebrows? Yeah
A	she could have really good eyebrows
C	mm
B	I think they I think they
C	wow
A	like if
B	I think they have done her eyebrows I think that is the eyebrow
C	oh right
A	yeah but they're still
B	yeah but I think that's it
A	oh
C	Woah
C	blonde
B	bloody hell
C	yeah
B	and young
A	it's a bit old make-up though isn't it
C	I'm not sure about the the extreme blonde
B	I quite like it
A	yeah
C	yeah yeah
B	mm yeah yeah
A	like that's quite nineties
C	is it
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	suits her face
B	yeah
C	quite pixie-ish
B	oh
A	yeah
B	she's so pretty
C	I wish I knew how to do that good go out proper eye make-up and I really do
B	it's very hard though
C	mm
B	when I went to Mac for a make-up makeover thing and they do all your make-up and then I looked in the mirror and I thought I just look like a drag queen
A	drag queen
C	mm
B	it was just so so over the top
A	Lancome are good
B	just and colours I would never use
A	I'm quite good at eye make-up
B	yeah
A	but I just wear the same type of colours I never wear blacks or browns
B	oh yes
A	my craziest colours now is probably purple
B	bit of green yeah
C	yeah I used to wear a lot of green and blue
B	mm
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	Cos I
A	who is it
C	realised it just looks better
B	I'm I know
C	basically
B	I never really wear make-up these days
A	mm
C	really?
B	like during the day I've got a bit a bit of foundation bit of eyeliner bit of mascara that'd be it
A	I
B	Cos I just can't be arsed
C	no
A	I wear this every day
B	I think if I can get away with yeah
A	every day
B	I think if I can get away with it at this age about not wearing
C	that's what I wear
B	I'm gonna milk it as long as I can
A	mm
C	A bit of eyeliner mascara and
A	mm
C	and that's about it
A	I always wear foundation
B	mm
A	no I can't do that
B	no I
A	right
B	today I'm not going to the office
A	I can't do that
C	luckily I think I brought my mascara with my eyeliner with me
B	key important things
C	put those on
B	is she actually naked? God
C	so
B	what are they? You've got a flashing message?
C	no that's been there since I got the phone
B	Good
C	I don't know what it is
A	you don't know what it is
B	how long have you had the phone?
A	mm
B	Good
C	going to about just over two years
B	Good good
C	hopefully I can get a new one soon in March
B	you must be due one
C	I have been due loads but I've been going through simplicity things
B	oh right yeah
C	to keep it cheap
B	nice
C	now I've gotta wait till March
A	can I feel how heavy it is?
C	then I can get an iPhone
A	oh it's not too bad
C	I'm gonna get an iPhone
B	oh that's quite exciting
C	I'm so excited
A	yeah I really want an iPhone
B	oh
A	after it died at New Year
B	the Samsung
A	I know I used to love it
B	mm
A	but I like them better than the iPhone
C	yeah I'm a bit uh
B	like if you've had Apple products before then it's it's fine
A	yeah
B	but I think there's probably quite a learning curve there
C	I think it's gonna take me a while
A	mm
B	mm
C	mm
A	so they can't be that bad
B	I love them
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	and obviously because my phone is about a million years old and it's worth ten pounds um on Mazuma mobile um I've got nothing to go towards a phone so unless I get a contract that's forty pounds a month I have to pay two hundred pounds for the new phone
A	oh God
B	so I just think there's just so unless my until my phone dies there's no uh incentive for me to do it
A	no
B	apart from the fact that it's beautiful
C	apart from the beauty of course
A	I
B	I don't have any wellies
C	no
A	oh I wish I had wellies
B	I wish I had wellies
A	I have boots
C	do you what I find the best thing is um Ugg boots
B	absorbent
A	yeah
C	but actually they're the warmest thing and they are surprisingly absorbent
B	yeah but you don't want absorbent though do you surely if it's wet outside
C	I was no I mean they're um I mean they're you know they don't
A	absorb the snow in
C	no it doesn't go through them
A	ah
C	and also it cleans them
B	oh useful
C	I always wear them in the snow deliberately because they come out really clean
B	oh
C	anyway
A	oh that's wise
B	are they have they got any grip
B	oh
A	oh
C	mine aren't actually Ugg they're just sheepskin but they seem to work
B	that's interesting
C	Cos I tried wellies and wellies are too cold
A	no
B	no you've gotta be wearing um
C	welly socks
B	welly socks yeah
A	yeah my welly socks work
C	well I've got nice um boots with a heel
B	oh
B	well at least you're just getting in a cab now
C	yeah
A	yeah
B	so that's
C	if you want to go and play um
B	no no no no we're not in any hurry
A	we've got all day
C	we've got
B	the snow is the snow's not going anywhere
C	we've got ages before the taxi comes
A	I need a wee
C	so
B	oh that's fine
C	no
B	do you want anything? Tea coffee hot chocolate? Um food
B	any of that
B	none of the others
B	ah
C	right
A	oh I think
C	mm
B	cam yeah Cam Cab is who you rang
C	that's weird it's come up as Cam Cab
B	you must have it saved
C	yeah
B	what time did you call them?
C	eleven oh three
B	so they should be coming at twelve thirty
C	yeah
B	okay
C	yeah
B	oh
C	you should
B	that's what my Mum said
C	really?
B	but I'll I'll just take photos of the wound
C	that's what a lot of people do though
B	I know like
B	it's like a photo diary of my war wounds
C	yeah
B	look at your face?
C	the one little bit of make-up I had left on
C	is now smudged all over my face
B	that's okay
B	yeah
C	yeah see I want one because I haven't got a camera at the moment and I haven't got an iPhone
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	four S is the one um that talks to you
C	I don't I'm not bothered about the talking
B	and you can't transpose messages
A	ha ha ha
C	mm
B	just in case it uh
B	takes over the world
C	feed it
B	Don't feed it
C	apparently you can get this thing on iPhones where this app where you can um I really don't like the hair
B	too blonde
C	mm
B	on my God
C	you know when you're like what is that song?
B	yeah
C	you can do that apparently on the new iPhone
B	genius
C	I know
B	it's really bloody clever the old iPhone
C	someone at work was talking about it and said it actually worked cos they tried
B	wow
C	in the car they they heard
B	mm
C	and they were like what is that tune that goes
B	and the iPhone knew
C	and it
B	Cos you can ask it things like how is Steven Gerrard
C	really?
B	and it'll and it'll go out it will search on search engines like Wikipedia or Google whatever and it will tell you Steven Gerrard is thirty-four years old
B	Cos you'd think you'd have to ask it questions in a certain way for it to know
C	yeah
B	but you can say is it gonna rain do I need my umbrella how wet will it be? or you know in a variety of ways
C	it must just pick up must pick up like key words
C	yeah
B	it's amazing
C	A lot of it's kind of unnecessary I think
B	oh look her hair looks nice there though all plastered down on her face
C	yeah that looks better
B	think it looks cool
C	yeah
B	I still don't like the black and yellow
C	wow
B	but she looks like a completely different person
C	mm
B	yeah
C	yeah she looks like a bee
B	they've done such a good job
C	yeah
C	buzz
B	get your undercrackers out
C	ooh I like that underwear
B	it's nice
C	yeah she has
B	mm
B	like the ideal body hasn't she you know
C	yeah
B	quite petite
C	yeah
B	big boobs
C	that's really nice underwear
B	like you
C	mm
B	oh
B	this is our hotel room in Brighton
C	oh
C	yeah
B	and I'd been up since seven cos I drove down and um I fell asleep
C	where is that did you say?
B	in Brighton
C	oh
B	to see her and to see her Mum and her family and like our old haunts my old house and
C	yeah
B	and I could hear people but I just like sort of
C	zoned it out
B	be aware and then hiya and then roll over
B	she was so frazzled
C	yeah
B	she was like I expect a good night's sleep
C	yeah
B	so she just came back to the room was like writing complaint letters like going on trip advisor and checking up all these reviews
C	yeah
B	people weren't really going out cos they were going out at New Year so it was a very different experience
C	yeah
B	she had such a good time so um
C	the same hotel
B	same hotel yeah so in the morning they wouldn't give us our money back all she'd paid
C	mm no
B	so they gave her her money back to a hundred pounds and then gave us late checkout
C	mm
B	but she was pretty frazzled for that entire next day
C	oh
B	oh okay
C	that's not bad though
B	mm
C	exactly see I probably would've just thought oh well you know it's it is gonna be noisy cos it's on the front and probably wouldn't have complained and then wouldn't have got anything
B	well they I mean the thing is they say we don't want stag parties we don't want hen parties like no groups of more than two men or women
C	yeah
B	are allowed
C	yeah
B	so to be able to like bill yourself as one thing and then say oh well it's a party town what do you expect?
C	yeah exactly
B	it's it's a bit cheeky
C	Cos you'd think they'd have ways of
C	limiting the noise
B	right
A	yeah good
B	hm?
A	when we need to go play in the snow we might need to go and get coffee somewhere
B	that sounds like a lovely idea
A	that sounds like a good plan doesn't it
B	oh sweetie I'm really sad you have to go home and do work
C	I know so am I
A	stupid work
C	it is stupid work
B	I think I think teaching might not be the um the plan
A	all that's cracked up to be
C	it's just the uh yeah
B	mm
C	that this has to be done
B	yeah
C	and any other weekend it would be fine
B	mm
C	generally I don't work at weekends much at all now
B	mm
C	but um this is just
B	it would've been perfect cos then it would've been
C	and yeah
B	bastards
C	yeah that's true
B	so you it's more than likely that you won't have to go to school tomorrow
C	which would be amazing
B	which would be great cos you could just stay in bed
C	but I don't know when we
B	yeah
C	so I still have to get all my work do all my work just in case
B	oh
C	yeah
B	tomorrow
C	yeah
A	mm
B	at least then you know even if you have to get up for school
C	yeah exactly
B	and you get a phone call saying no it's off you'd be like lovely
C	yeah
A	I really want to sit on the futon
B	sit on the futon
A	when I saw it over there and I wanted to sit on it
B	yeah get involved
B	it's nice
A	ah
A	oh
B	they're that's pyjamas
A	maniac
C	that is the blanket
B	there's the blanket
A	God
B	what's the matter with you? Yeah
B	yeah we could definitely do that
A	Jesus
B	Jesus
B	under the age of
A	yeah
B	has she got twins or something? Oh my god they all smack each other in the face
A	oh my god
B	oh they must be twins mustn't they? Oh there's triplets
A	triplets
A	I'm quite excited to have my hair done tomorrow
B	yeah
A	uh
B	mm
C	what're you doing with it?
A	just
C	blonde? That's what I'm doing next weekend
A	I'm not having it cut though
B	mm
A	I might leave it another three weeks and then I might do it
B	yeah
A	I'd love some water
B	water? Smithy?
C	yes please
B	water
A	yeah I I wasn't going to I was gonna let all the dye grow out a bit so I didn't have to dye it any more um then I started doing that and realised how grey I am
C	really?
A	yep really very grey
C	oh no
A	so I was like oh my god I'm not even twenty-five
C	yeah
A	yeah so now we've we've block coloured over it
C	thank you
A	and then so I figured if she comes and puts blonde through
C	yeah
A	just then when the grey starts coming through
C	it'll blend in more
A	you won't see it
B	you're welcome
C	that's the one good thing about being blonde
A	yeah
C	it will um
A	yeah
C	covers up the grey
A	I mean it's not shocking it's not like a chunk of white yet but you can definitely see it
C	I think some grey can look quite nice
C	I think they somehow pull it off
B	bastards
C	mm
A	although
B	it's not fair
C	yeah
B	officially
A	officially
C	wow
C	maybe I'll just give up now
B	yeah just kill yourself now
C	yeah
B	I might put some clean trousers on as well
A	I want to get snow in
B	well if we're gonna actually like go and I suppose if we're gonna get takeaway coffee we're gonna sit in somewhere
A	oh
C	sit in the snow
B	yeah cos we'll be cos we'll be cold
A	have you lost weight or something?
C	no
A	really?
C	I don't think so
B	your leg's looking pretty skinny
A	you look
C	dunno
B	you're stressed?
B	Don't be stressed
C	what
B	Cos there's triplets under two
C	oh
B	what would happen if I wear these in the snow?
A	I don't know
C	I think they'd be fine
B	think that'd be alright
C	well actually I don't quote me on that
C	yeah
A	I'll be putting my boots on
B	I've got these cheapo Tesco's bad boys
A	yeah
B	the snow but then
A	I think your feet would get soaked if you fell off
C	I hate wearing leggings on the second day without washing them
A	yeah
C	Cos they've gone all baggy
C	they were really tight yesterday
A	who was I I remember I bought some leggings recently and they're really good even on the second day
C	really?
A	yeah
C	I get all mine from H and M which is probably not the best
C	no
C	I hate it when you I always get it with skinny jeans as well if I
A	mm
C	like I can basically only wear them
A	I get it round the knees
C	bag yeah
C	yeah
B	that's what wrong with the snow though you don't want anything that's gonna absorb
A	oh
B	Maz kept kicking the stones in my shoe
C	I haven't been to Brighton for ages I love Brighton
A	I have been there before
B	it's pretty exciting
A	oh I had a dream we had a road trip
B	that's cos we were talking about it yesterday
A	to a beach
B	mm and we've been talking about going to the beach for ages
A	yeah
B	we will have to though
A	yeah it would
C	can I come?
B	mm
C	thanks
B	let's do it
C	yeah
A	yeah let's
B	oh a year
A	let's run away from real life
C	you're supposed to be working as well
A	yeah
C	I'll be fine
A	the pile
C	like the pile yeah
C	but this is still nothing compared to my first year where I'd spend
A	yeah first year
C	every every yeah every weekend I used to have this guilt thing about like doing anything at all other than working
[ANNOTATION]	they are not sure that was first year or not	Neutral
A	yeah
C	and
A	and during the week you used to call at you
C	mm
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	chop and change levels and sometimes you can re-use stuff in classes but very rarely cos it wasn't
C	yeah exactly
A	it was just light uh
C	yeah at least I've
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about book	Contradiction
A	but I mean I always kept it all which I suppose you probably have as well so as the next year comes round he's got bits that he can use
C	yeah
B	Cos
C	although I've changed schools each year so it hasn't really helped me so far
A	oh
B	but then can you just re-use everything then cos no-one will know
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about school	Neutral
C	well you you yeah but I this is the first year I've taught year three so it's all different anyway
B	oh
C	and obviously you have to
B	oh right
C	so you couldn't just do your own thing you'd have to you have to plan with them
B	oh so there's another class for that year group
C	yeah and they kind of encourage you to change the plans anyway like from one year to the next year you have to adapt it for the children you've got and so it wouldn't be I mean it still would eventually if you stayed in the same school and taught the same year for a few years yeah it would get easier
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about weather	Contradiction
B	mm
C	I've just never really got to that stage
B	uh
C	fishing
B	boring
C	Don likes fishing
B	oh not another one
C	I know
[ANNOTATION]	person C likes fishing	Neutral
B	what what what is it about you and uh men who fish
C	men who like fishing and men who have dodgy knees and dodgy yeah dodgy knees basically
B	Dodgy knees
C	yeah
B	is that the age
A	how random
B	is that the age of the men that you're dating?
C	always
B	it's a bit weird
C	and it's because I think it's because they're always quite sporty
A	oh
C	these knee injuries and then forever they just have knee problems
A	crap knees
C	yeah they've had
B	mm
C	actually
B	right
C	but he had all his allergies and stuff
