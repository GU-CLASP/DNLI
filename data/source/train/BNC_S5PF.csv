D	very sensitive
E	mm
C	yeah
C	so we don't care about the structure
E	it's a sign
C	yeah exactly
A	it's got a Free Tibet sticker
C	I mean I was surprised they didn't put it in all the the the  about the the property you know
C	it's er obviously a good selling point
E	huh er
E	do you think he did sell it then today?
C	yeah I would think
E	this guy as well he worked for the British
C	yeah
E	he's made ten
B	mm mm
E	he made twelve
C	yeah it could have been anything couldn't it
D	but
B	moving to Salford's not gonna be as nice as living in Kingsley
E	he's from Manchester though so you know
B	oh in that case I probably wouldn't like him anyway
D	look when I think of  I think of  success stories I think of the Aspinall
C	easier decision
D	I think of Jonathan Aspinall's success
E	but those were the days though
A	yeah but then
E	that was like the lustre days
C	that's
A	does that the not just mean that you have to plough the two hundred into the new property price so you lose it anyway
E	but you  But you  don't get that amount of
A	but if you're thinking that these people are selling their houses
D	but quite
E	even my brother  Even my brother  he bought  he bought  a house
C	it depends on which area you're moving to cos some area didn't or weren't all that as um as expensive
D	for er
E	but they kind of
C	different advertising or
A	mm
E	there was a  There was a  big boom of literally you you could buy a house
D	yeah
C	they went up seven or eight
A	yeah
D	firstly sorry for a second
A	my logic is if you're selling a  if you're selling a  house and you make a fifty percent profit on it
D	yeah
E	you're still gonna
A	if you imagine that you're buying a new house to live in
D	but it's
A	which will be fifty percent more expensive
E	but you can
D	possibly or possibly less expensive
E	so my brother made
C	yeah
E	so in  So in  Leicester my brother made thirty grand on his house
A	mm
D	exactly
E	you know so he's got that
D	so so this guy right
A	but at the same point in time which
D	like like okay look at this Jonathan Aspinall
E	it was still when he was doing it it was still like he's I mean his house in London is still going up in price
D	but look at this  look at this
C	house prices in London are going up
E	yep
D	yeah but look at this Jonathan Aspinall situation
A	but did he wanna live in Hull?
D	no as an example
A	oh yeah if if your moving
D	that goes straight into a mortgage

E	well I did didn't I?
C	like a
E	er from Tuesday I throw myself back in it

E	is this what you're apologising about?
D	and I haven't got any snacks
A	Don't worry Indi Indi
D	and I'm really sorry it's like tins of Rajma and chickpeas and crap like that
E	you could put them together with some lemon ginger

E	well I I think it's
D	I know
A	we are saved
D	I know
A	we're saved
D	I know you are but I know
A	we're saved by Sainsbury's Taste the Difference pizza

D	I know we've all had a good hearty lunch but what I
E	I I fell asleep Mani and then I just and then I literally went into this dead sleep
A	I'm gonna go and get the pizza out
E	and that's when I was like burning up
C	well
E	find the
C	thermometer
E	thermometer because I couldn't I
C	thermo-mometer
E	Cos when you said are you're burning up I'll come round
D	why?
E	and I was actually gonna say to you yes but then I took a couple of Nurofen and then
D	why did that happen when you've come off the antibiotics? Is that the?
E	I don't know
D	yeah
E	the collar on my tee-shirt
D	but why? Why do you think that happened?
E	I don't know
C	you just need to rest and relax
E	I've pushed myself
D	just rest isn't it
C	yeah it er it's er
E	but I can't take
D	surveillance
E	I'm on under surveillance and I've been told that you know um apparently I've I've had because I had those
D	they're just watching you
E	they're just watching me so I can't have any days off
D	you have to be careful
E	maybe I've just got a bit of a cold or something
C	it all resets itself after the end of March anyway so
E	maybe it's because the antibiotics stopped on Tuesday
D	yeah
E	and then I I've really been I've
C	yeah what did you do on that Tuesday? You went to work and then you went out
E	I went
C	you went to
E	I had a half or beer a half of shandy
C	no I just think it's more the fact that you were up and about doing lots of things
D	that's it
E	but I had to  But I had to  push myself
C	it doesn't matter if you drink or not
E	I was on the verge of like you know I have
C	I know but you've gotta get into it slowly
E	then on Friday we got  Friday we got  into work at about nine
D	you didn't
E	both of us
C	two pints?
E	yeah okay fair enough two pints
C	no it adds up
D	she did
C	do you know what I'm saying?
D	it's only two pints
D	it was only two pints over a like seven hours
C	no that's fine I not saying
D	we were out for ages
E	I don't know but I did feel dodgy after the meal
D	that's the meal
C	that meal wasn't great to be honest
D	I think  I think I think  what you're saying is
E	I think  I think  the problem
D	that it's the general going out rushing around and all of that isn't it?
[ANNOTATION]	The meal was a roast beef.	Neutral
C	yeah you've gotta give your body a chance to just
E	but I have to push it I have to
C	I know
E	maybe it was what I
C	nobody nobody er you don't want to be ill
E	what I  thought was cos I did have a  I did have a  bit of a cough
[ANNOTATION]	People prefer to be healthy than sick.	Entailment
C	it's not that you can't be ill
E	and then
C	oh I see
E	it's probably not very good for anyone
D	what
E	yeah
D	I know
E	they're only like these bits
D	I know
E	but it was just cos I suddenly like I think if I'd have taken my temperature it had soared
[ANNOTATION]	Being ill is on bad for the single person that has the symptoms.	Contradiction
