B	there's BBC News
A	mm
B	bBC4 is good
A	mm
B	you get intelligent programmes on that
A	mm
B	iTV4 or whatever
A	yeah
B	but there's not much
A	yesterday has one thing interesting perhaps a day or
B	I think er but you have to like with everything
A	and Film4
B	you have to scan and and
A	but no the point is you know there's like a hundred odd channels isn't there
B	yeah
A	and they're all just crap aren't they
B	oh yeah
A	most of them  most of them  You know and the even in the daytime you still can't find anything to watch
B	I but I'm thinking of kids
A	mm
B	plus film channels they they subscribe to
A	yeah
B	must spend their whole lives watching TV
A	I suppose
B	some people do don't they
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	there's always that chatshow crap in the morning and
B	yeah
A	then it sort of settles down a bit
B	they don't really give you more choice do they
A	it doesn't really give yeah
B	Mid-morning if you want to watch something serious
A	exactly
A	er you know the
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	all very old
B	that't it
A	stick to pretty much the same format
A	mm
B	no
A	nine A M
A	yeah
B	or not
A	but you've like you know documentaries you know that er er that's
B	yeah
A	isn't it
B	it's all about Hitler
A	yeah
B	it should be called the Hitler channel
B	it is isn't it
A	film Five should be called like is it Film Five or something? The Steven Seagal channel
B	yes
A	lethal Weapon
B	and
A	lethal Weapon or
B	Jurassic Park on ITV1
A	Jurassic Park
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	like Stardust was on a
B	what's that one?
A	er it's sort of like a
B	is it like NeverEnding Story?
A	it's a bit like that
A	A bit more updated
B	I guess they buy the rights to certain films
A	I suppose so
B	don't they
A	yes
B	so they you know show it as much as possible
A	as much as they
B	fill up the schedule
A	yeah
B	with something isn't it
A	and and then it kind of and then they replace it with something else and then it comes back again
A	who
B	iTV3 always play Poirot
A	yeah
A	and then
B	your heart would stop if you watched all of it
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	oh yeah I know
A	have you ever watched well well
B	that's in Battersea that
A	is it?
B	it's next to Battersea Park
A	oh
B	where the Observer newspaper used to be
A	oh yeah
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	mm
B	and black building
A	yeah but who you know do
B	I dunno
A	mm yeah
B	yeah that was quite interesting for a while
A	but then you know but you know wouldn't you go to the garden centre?
B	well to be honest
A	I
B	I I get much more entertainment from the internet
A	mm
B	like videos
A	yeah
B	Cos cos because you can be in control
A	sure
B	you can watch something on YouTube
A	yeah
B	you can pause it
A	yeah
B	I find TV too passive
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	yeah
A	there's nothing you can do
B	but I think most people nowadays find the internet much more
A	yeah
B	for news and video
A	mm
B	like I don't  I don't I don't  wait for the six o'clock news to get news
A	and and and and that's what I mean
B	no
A	thing has it
B	yeah
A	four screens at once
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	and that it's still plodding along with its traditional
B	they were talking about putting internet on the TV weren't they
A	that would be quite useful
B	you can stream it to your
A	that would be quite useful
B	yeah
A	put it inside our heads
B	thought control
A	and those yeah well you're not er
B	some countries like Korea seem to be want that don't they
A	mm
B	they get very frustrated with the speed of the internet
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	well why don't you look out the window for five minutes?
B	you know
B	nobody sends letters in Korea
A	no
B	Cos nobody has the patience to sit down and
A	I suppose not
B	and then  and then  go and buy a stamp
A	yeah
B	there must be
A	there are  there are  but not not like we have them here
B	every street corner
A	not these days
B	you have to go to you have to make a special trip to a post office?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	some countries are like that
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	sign and their postbox outside and the postman
A	mm
A	Cos most people don't
B	that's part of the fun
A	find it first
A	with a a big hat on
B	yeah
A	it's funny cos I we do do you remember
A	at your your
B	yes
A	well yeah there's probably quite a few
B	many
B	yeah
A	I dunno
B	there were three together
A	oh
A	I met er one one time she was asking me
B	oh yes
A	well
B	hey hey hey
B	did she really ask you that? Er
A	well she sort of said what do you no not that quite like that
B	did she know your wife was Korean
A	I can't remember if I suppose she might
B	or maybe or I think it was Korea or Japan
A	I guess so
B	because they they've had more um democracy for longer and
A	I think so
B	the the the what do you call it? The cosmopolitanism of the people
A	right
B	and the sophistication of the people
A	okay
A	and I think if you look at that sort of they were in the same war as us
B	yeah
A	you know
B	but it's easy to explain because Japan's generation went through the sixties
A	yeah
B	they had the Korean War in the fifties
A	it's a  it's a  bit of a kind of
B	they had a
A	yep
B	so there you're talking about two generations who've been
A	so in terms of culture
B	through the pop culture
A	pop culture
B	more in common with people
A	more sort of common ground
B	that's what it's that includes
A	sorry?
B	you didn't say that to her
A	no
B	that would've been my explanation
A	er I think so
B	yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	but I mean it's difficult to sort of say there's one one
B	you can't generalize
A	reason
B	yeah
A	I mean there's probably quite a
B	mm
A	village
B	yeah
A	they're they're interested in these type of things aren't they
B	very very English
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	you know
B	yeah
A	which you don't often find with
B	she said that? Oh no
B	denigrate your own her own nation
A	I I should explain the
B	those were her words
A	I'd just introduced her to the term savages
B	oh no
A	Cos she was on about um
B	oh
A	and I said yeah savages
B	oh no
A	to
B	maybe she thinks of it in terms of country bumpkin
A	well you see
B	she mean uncouth or
A	A a lot of Koreans are really rough
B	ah
A	really you know once you go outside of Seoul
B	mm
A	de de de de de are are very
B	Small? Unsophisticated?
A	no you know there's a lot of when you're actually there
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	like in
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	I often had students going oh yeah the quality of those people is not good
A	oh okay
B	what do you mean the quality is not good? And they meant things like you know people who spit on pavements and
A	mm
B	shout in restaurants and
A	mm
B	elbow
A	and there's a lot of that
B	yeah
A	they don't have the kind of and I suppose
B	it does doesn't it
A	and like
B	yeah
A	so we had some Japanese guy I think I I've said to you
B	Japan's the other extreme isn't it
A	yeah
A	he brought round a box of um he was coming round to look at some of
B	oh right clothes yeah
A	and he came round and he brought sort of
B	samples
A	yeah a box of rice crackers
B	oh
A	and it was wrapped up
B	wrapped
A	and tied up
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	and perfect
B	but but but that's it's but it's interesting that you say that because the
A	mm
B	even though they've got all this war history and they they
A	yeah
B	they don't like that side of things
A	mm
B	cultured societies
A	and and and so like
B	yeah
A	things like this as well can't we
B	mm
A	there are you know we do like to do little nice little quaint things don't we
B	yeah
A	and I think the Japanese
B	quaint
A	quite like
B	yeah
A	and um but quaint and Korea don't really sit comfortably together
A	you know
B	loud
A	you know eating is what
B	yeah
A	you know get to go and be loud
B	which some people might find refreshing
A	sure
B	er you know
A	well
B	reserved and
A	exactly
B	Down to everything is down to earth
A	exactly
B	yeah
A	get stuck in and they don't care about
B	but your wife doesn't see it as down to earth?
A	um she well she's kind of like I I think
B	embarrassed by it?
A	I don't know
B	she gets very self-conscious about
A	I suppose er I suppose well it's like you know when you go away from your
B	just it's like seeing British tourists in the south of Spain
B	yeah
A	you know
B	ordering fish and chips and
A	stand outside
B	yeah
A	of your culture
B	yeah
A	you know I suppose once you're there you don't notice it
B	or Americans watching American tourists abroad
A	yeah
B	yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	you know
B	and you think oh my God are we really like that?
A	yeah
B	yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	yeah
B	it's yeah it's understandable
A	yeah
B	no that's good
A	it is
B	means she means she's very aware isn't she
A	yeah
B	Cos some people are totally unaware of that
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	she was in in Melbourne
B	yeah
A	and just carry on as if they're in Korea
B	as if they're in Korea
A	you know
B	wow
A	what of how they
B	Cos they've been such a homogenized nation for so long
A	I suppose
B	yeah
A	themselves
B	they don't see other people as sort of
A	they don't
B	mm
A	Cos when you go to a restaurant they don't care who's there there there you know
B	yeah
A	and that's it
B	not curious about anything
A	they're not
B	yeah
A	not curious and not but not also not inhibited by people
B	no
A	either
B	mm
A	you know so you know like I said you know we're always a bit sort of self-conscious
A	you know they're they're just nothing to them
B	really
A	and that's kind of good in a way but also a bit weird
B	no but it's a
A	mm
B	like it's like you say the family bubble
A	mm
B	are the people are non-persons
A	yes
B	almost
A	yes
B	there's no
A	mm
B	consciousness of the
A	no
B	wider community isn't it
A	and and and I sometimes feel that I'm part of one of those non-persons
B	mm
B	mm
A	often when he goes to Japan
B	mm
A	he's the kind of
B	the outsider
A	the person who doesn't really you don't need to figure in these decisions
B	even though you're family
A	or and he's black as well
B	oh really? That's
A	so he kind of doesn't really
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	prejudice aren't they
A	yeah
B	skin colour and
A	yeah
B	that's yeah that must be interesting
A	so it's it it's and it is funny you know like I said about the the whole education thing
B	and what I find most sad is lack of curiosity
A	mm
B	Cos I think certain times in my in I mean it happens everywhere but in er every culture
A	mm
B	and ways of doing things
A	mm
B	and
A	mm
B	in this sort of bubble
A	mm
B	so the lack of awareness
A	mm
B	just astounding actually
A	it is
B	mm
A	you know having the history that they've had you know like with their
B	they've always been in in between Japan and
A	exactly
B	China
A	you know
B	mm
A	colonized and
B	mm
A	and they banned their like their hairstyle and their writing and things like this
B	the national psyche
A	exactly
B	mm
A	and and
B	so what was
A	I don't think so
B	but how did she know? Cos you can't that's a bit of an assumption to make isn't it
A	I think that I well I dunno
B	that's what she observed?
A	I suppose so
B	in the street
A	yeah
B	mm
B	it's funny because they they often complained about teachers to me
A	did they?
B	they  they didn't like  they didn't like um the New Zealand girl
A	okay
B	but she was they felt she wasn't good enough to teach them
A	yeah
B	and you get students coming to you and you think oh I don't like her I don't
A	there was a South African guy that they used to
B	oh yeah
A	more as well
B	he was late all the time
A	was he?
A	you see er but see
B	he was bad
A	was he?
A	you have no idea what they saying about
B	I know
A	Cos they you know
B	yeah
A	you kind of think oh you know I I appreciate your you know sort of
B	candour
A	er er and and you know that you're sharing this information with me
B	yeah
A	you kind of do wonder about
B	it's awkward isn't it
A	Cos I remember the er like I cos I know that Koreans er er er again they've got a particular idea of what is you know they're not  they're not  flexible
B	yeah
A	they're not kind of
A	on the you know in a  in a  dialogue situation
B	she wanted you to write it down?
A	well she wanted yeah
B	oh no
A	yeah
B	thinking far too logically about it
A	exactly
A	no it's because they do everything by memory don't they
B	yeah
A	they want to memorise everything
B	oh yeah
A	and the guy said hello my name is duh duh duh
B	blank stare
A	and he just
B	er
A	looked at his piece of paper and what right hang on the
B	oh really? Huh
A	that's not the response that
B	mm
A	and they want to have these
B	dialogues
A	dialogues
B	yeah
A	that they can just memorise and
B	that is the problem with dialogues in books
A	yeah
B	they don't reflect er real er
A	not at all
B	life
A	no
B	often
A	no
B	is Korean more formulaic?
A	well
B	yeah
A	that you know you see it all the time in
B	well certain languages might be more formulaic
A	some might languages might
B	yeah
A	and I wondered if er Italian's a bit like so when they answer the phone it's always er
[ANNOTATION]	all languages are formulaic	Contradiction
B	well they are cos
B	yeah yeah cos in
A	okay
B	to strangers that you don't use with or
A	okay
B	something like that
A	right
B	but in some cultures yeah you don't use certain words
A	no I'd say not
B	there are
A	yeah
B	fixed in some than others
A	yeah
B	so you know
A	like when they're on
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Japanese has similar cultural words as Korean has	Neutral
A	italians on the telephone
B	ah
A	and it's quite and and and I don't think I've ever heard anyone speak on a phone who hasn't said that
B	mm
A	at the beginning of a conversation
A	you know
[ANNOTATION]	Italians talk the same ways as Americans on the phone	Contradiction
B	in Japan they say
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	duh duh duh duh
B	in China you would say wait wait
A	okay
[ANNOTATION]	In Hong Kong people say hi hi	Neutral
B	but in England you don't have to say that
A	ah yeah
B	er
A	yeah
B	yep
A	oh okay
B	what's up?
[ANNOTATION]	In Australia people don't do that either	Neutral
A	but I mean more than just the initial it it's more than just the initial kind of greeting
B	mm
A	it's the kind of like you know hi
B	mm
A	or rather than
B	mm
A	you know or  you know or  hello
B	yeah
A	or hi
B	there still are things that are inappropriate though aren't there
A	yeah
B	to your boss
A	yeah
B	or er
A	yeah
B	doesn't exist in English but it's different it's it's er
A	yes
B	you have to learn the convention don't you
A	I think so
B	for the language
A	and I  and I  would say there's a lot I dunno  I dunno
B	er the those people are probably
A	I just just have a feeling
B	probably translating their formal convention into English
A	right
B	so the Korean learner was trying to maybe in Korean you can learn some formulaic phrases
A	perhaps so
B	in English
A	and that's what I mean
B	yeah
A	perhaps in service transaction okay there are  there are  formed
B	yeah
A	there is a
B	like can I help you? Yeah
A	yeah
B	but also the student is not aware of how language works
A	right
B	no matter what background they're from
A	mm
B	can you write down some sentences for me? And then they
A	mm
B	they get the same problem
A	yeah
B	so it might not be a problem with the language background of the person
A	mm
B	and that could be from any cultural background
A	true
B	you know
A	and indeed it's also a a a mistake that coursebook writers make themselves
B	yeah
A	and I was thinking today about about this you know how we we we give students a list of words or phrases and we say okay now I want you to put those into a dialogue
B	mm
A	forgetting that the dialogue is actually interactive
B	negotiated
A	what depends on what I say and depends and so we we might have these phrases but we're never gonna get them into the dialogue
B	yeah
A	Informs the next part
B	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Person B is thinking about the next part	Neutral
A	yeah
A	there are
A	yeah
B	but it's like the lesson sequencing isn't it
A	now use it
B	free practice
A	yeah
B	and it is artificial in that way
A	it is because the free practice isn't really that free
A	went cinema
B	I never corrected much though in
A	I didn't
B	because it doesn't work
[ANNOTATION]	Person B think is doesnt work	Neutral
A	no
B	something's not happened in their  in their  cognition
A	yeah
B	to to recognise it as a mistake
A	yes
B	and that's
A	well that's that's the fault of the
B	you you're not gonna correct it by orally correcting it
A	I don't think so
B	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Person B think if you want to correct it you have to do something sayin is not solving any problem	Neutral
A	manifestations is that you know okay er you can try it now to do practice and hope that they integrate those
B	mm
A	but to
B	Cos it always seems quite laboured doesn't it
A	yeah
B	that's why I gave up on a lot of the techniques
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	and it's not effective
[ANNOTATION]	Person B is going to dance	Contradiction
B	it's just it's not working is it
A	yeah
B	so you're thinking hang on a minute I must be doing something wrong here
[ANNOTATION]	Person b think he must do something wrong if he just do it in a minute	Neutral
A	yes
B	you know
A	no that's quite an interesting way of putting it
B	yeah
A	there's nothing wrong with hard work
B	no
A	yeah
B	but
[ANNOTATION]	Person B is going to dance	Contradiction
A	yeah
B	it's you know when you're it's like beating your head against a wall
A	yeah
B	and you you
A	yeah
B	it hurts and you're not doing anything
A	no
B	you're just hurting yourself
A	and and a lot of the time er the students don't even pick up on those differences
B	yeah
A	it's
B	oh yeah
A	does it  does it  really inhibit meaning? And he said well no of course not
B	it just doesn't sound right
A	and so what really is if you're  if you're  focusing on sort of trying to get meaning out what's the point in banging on
B	yeah
A	their heads because they make a small grammatical error? Oh
B	Cos you listen to people like at your um tut you know if you listen I listen to the World Service a lot
A	mm
B	who are non-native English speakers
A	yeah
B	but it it hasn't
A	yeah
B	it it doesn't detract
A	no not at all
B	at all
A	not at all
B	they've got a wonderful vocabulary
A	yeah
B	they can understand a hundred
A	yeah
B	a hundred percent of what they are
A	yeah
B	listening to
A	yeah
B	mistakes
A	yeah
B	so does it matter that they don't
B	yeah
A	mm
B	miss the S off now and again
A	exactly
B	or
A	and how many times have you seen that on you know they say okay put an S in the corner of the board and a square round it
B	oh I haven't seen that
A	it's a
B	oh really?
A	and students
B	I haven't seen that method
A	oh teacher
B	ah
A	ah
B	you don't beat him with a stick
A	he like
A	not the first time
A	ah
B	oh yeah
A	okay
B	and this goes on and on  and on and on
A	matches
A	or break it over your head
B	oh right
A	yeah
B	if they're not hearing it they're not gonna correct themselves are they
A	and and the thing is no sure
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	you know
A	the they they're not thinking about oh but he missed an S off
B	unless that's
A	unless er yes unless that's what you're there for
B	no
A	oh
B	I mean it was so obvious because they would  they would  not hear it
A	okay
B	like I'd play the tape like or the CD like with them three or four times and none of them could hear what what they were not hearing
A	oh
B	missing an S
A	which is gonna always gonna be problematic
B	yeah
A	in English isn't it
B	but the the the how I mean no matter how many times I played it
A	mm
B	they just couldn't hear it
A	say say say for
B	he he he goes
A	yeah
B	they they would write he go
A	okay
B	um
A	think of a kind of fairly long sentence
B	he er usually goes to the supermarket on Wednesdays and Thursdays to buy
A	goes
B	the Z  the Z  sound is there
A	but that's a voiced sound isn't it
B	yeah
A	okay
B	it's always voiced isn't it? He goes
A	yeah
B	oh I'm sorry
A	is unvoiced is it
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	so
B	because he likes  he likes
A	he likes to watch
B	Cos it is a very soft S S
A	exactly
B	hiss sound
A	then it's possible that it's um
B	yeah
A	missable isn't it
B	ah
A	I dunno  I dunno
B	he likes
A	Cos he's sort of thinking that
B	yeah
A	ah my sister she really likes to go um
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	and the other one which always flummoxed them was the um I have been when it was contracted
A	I been
B	I be
A	I be
B	I be
A	no
B	yeah
A	but you can  you can  retrieve the meaning
B	but it er changes the whole tense
A	it it does but I mean you can retrieve meaning from I been really can't you
B	yeah
A	where is where the stress is
B	that's true
A	I be
B	that's true
A	I've been
B	and if you say the time I be there
A	yeah
B	no if you're using present imperfect you wouldn't say the date though would you
A	yeah
B	I've been there yesterday
A	ah
B	yeah
A	I've been hundreds of times
B	I be
A	I be
B	or I've been
A	no
B	mm
A	yeah
B	old English
A	you alright? I be brilliant
B	yeah
A	but yes I mean
B	I mean in some dialects the grammar changes doesn't it
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	the the interesting the I think for exam passes it matters
A	sure
B	but exam cos when I  when I  played these tapes to the
A	yeah
B	Cos I I I pointed this out to them
A	yeah
B	and it actually
A	yeah
B	towards it
A	and I think that's more valuable than actually
B	was valuable
A	sort of trying to just er make them repeat it
B	but then a lot of language teaching is about raising awareness
A	yeah
B	isn't it
A	sure
B	it's not about explicitly teaching something
A	oh
B	it's about raising well it is in a way but you're raising awareness of
A	mm
B	what
A	mm
B	what's there
A	yeah
B	in the language
A	mm
B	oh I hate drilling
A	yeah
B	mastery of pronunciation
A	yeah
B	unless the whole class can't say you know the same pen instead of pin
A	come from a language background
B	well yeah
A	shared language background
B	but usually you have a
A	I mean er so so glass reflection dress my we were
B	glass reflection dress?
B	oh I see
A	and and I said glass reflection
B	oh yes
A	glass reflection dress
B	glass glass glass reflection dress
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	and anyway and I
B	glass erection dress
A	well exactly
B	yes well
A	and I thought er but why am I saying this? But like like
B	yeah
A	you know L R
B	yes I noticed that
A	things
B	when she spoke
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	and same with
B	quite strong
B	yeah
A	they're still  they're still  there after ten years of saying it
