A	Apple watch
C	Apple watch oh right yeah
D	ah
A	there's not too much written about it yet because it's so new isn't it?
B	yes
A	so it's a bit difficult to find articles and
C	mm
B	academic trails
C	mm absolutely
A	yeah
C	are they on sale now these watches?
B	erm yes
C	mm yeah
B	they're about four hundred pounds
C	are they? mm
A	is that the cheapest?
B	yes the most expensive being about ten thousand pounds for a
A	ooh
C	oh gold one
A	I think it'll only be a fad
C	mm
B	I think the battery life is too short it only lasts one day
C	one day?
B	yes and then you've got to recharge it at the the mains point
D	what's that then?
B	the Iwatch
C	the Apple Iwatch
D	oh yeah
C	the battery lasts one day
A	charging
B	yes
A	I think people will get bored with that
C	mm
D	it does
C	mm
D	but all else I've really got to er
D	mm mm
A	mm they're always flat when you pick them up aren't they?
C	mm
B	I do have the strategy of having a charger in the car
C	oh yes
B	that's
D	in er it's like a lot of these things
C	mm hm
D	in practice
A	too much messing about on them
D	yeah
D	you want to you know
C	and you need really good eye sight to see it wouldn't you
B	yes
C	won't be any good of me
A	no
C	I can barely see the mobile
A	mm hm
C	not without my glasses
A	no
D	no
A	mm
D	yes it is
A	but an expensive one
D	mm and then they're wanting
A	mm
C	mm
A	with lots of spare cash who don't know what to do with it
D	of course another thing
C	mm
A	I know
D	because
A	learn to work it all and
D	or probably even the know how to do it
A	no
D	I mean some of the things I've got
C	mm
D	thank you mother
D	er
C	you've used up all your power
D	I've done it look I did I spotted them
A	oh yeah
D	on my old Singer Kodak
A	mm hm
C	mm hm
D	so you know that's er
A	yeah?
D	but nevertheless
B	mm
D	hey that's been a blooming
A	yes
D	no
B	no
D	no
A	should have just been routine cos it wasn't really that far was it?
D	no
A	foul play
D	mm hm but
B	it could have been hijacked rather that it being
C	mm
D	but something's happened
A	no
D	mm
B	mm in eight minutes
A	everybody will have felt that we're going down we're going down
C	mm
A	yeah
D	well it's a joint er
B	erm yes well a lot of the parts are made in those three countries and they are assembled in Toulouse
D	in where?
A	Toulouse
D	Toulouse in France
B	yes
A	quite likely
B	not all of them are Rolls-Royce some of them are General Electric
D	some have?
B	are General Electric
D	oh are they?
B	yes
D	American?
B	yes
C	but what we that particular one? was that a Rolls-Royce?
B	I would say for the Airbus Air three twenty the General Electric tends to be more popular
D	mm
B	because it has a lower fuel consumption than the Rolls-Royce
C	oh right
B	the Rolls-Royce tend to do best on the long range aircraft
D	mm
A	I'd have said something if we were losing that altitude that quickly
C	well well
B	well
B	they were wondering whether
C	it'd be terrifying
B	they'd lost oxygen and the crew were unconscious
A	oh right
D	well it's funny you mention that because there has been
B	mm yes
D	with the air being recirculated
A	oh right so you're getting poisonous fumes in
D	well
A	good job he was alright he could have been the same
D	mm I mean you can't open a window or anything there cos they're all pressurised you see
A	I want a bit of fresh air
D	yes mm
C	shot of
D	they could have put er oxygen masks on
A	yeah I was going to say they might have some tanks of oxygen canisters
D	mm
A	oh
D	that's the sort of terrain
A	right
D	yeah
A	not
D	they get the other one
A	unravel it
D	yeah
A	screaming
D	Maydays mm
A	I'd let off a Mayday
C	they'd hear you in the next
C	yeah definitely
A	I think something's wrong
C	well it must absolutely
B	it's also strange they lost contact with the air traffic control
C	mm
D	mind you once it gets down
A	you might lose your signal because of
D	mm
C	mm
A	yeah
A	he's just gone out for a walk apparently but he'll be back for his lunch
D	oh
A	well he'll have gone to the starting point maybe he's gone to
D	oh I see
A	perhaps that I don't know I wasn't informed so
B	I'm going into the university tomorrow afternoon
C	are you lad?
B	just having a meeting with one of my tutors
C	yeah
D	good
A	that's about the CV isn't it?
B	yes
A	think that's going quite well
B	it is
D	yes that's er
A	it is I think you need to start early and keep chipping it away and getting feedback and doing things extra to put on if you perceive any little gaps that might need
C	mm
B	said that he thought mine was erm nicely filled
A	build it up
B	with various interesting things and that some people he has have done absolutely nothing extra
D	er
C	yes
D	you know that type of thing and er which
A	that particular company
D	you know the the company or whatever
A	mm
D	mm
B	very often you are limited to erm
A	no
B	it's got to be erm one back to back A4 sheet of paper
A	you can only do two sides one back to back A4
D	mm hm
C	mm it's
D	what er sized print?
B	well
C	oh
B	requires some very sort of clever organisation really you've got to make sure the margins are as wide as they can be so you can get as much material in
D	yes
A	mm
C	yeah
B	you don't want the type to be so small that you need your glasses on to read it
C	that you don't
D	difficult yeah difficult to read
B	so but on the other hand you don't want it to be size eighteen that it takes up too much space so it's just got to be somewhere in between really
A	too much space
C	mm yeah
B	I think fourteen is generally the recommended
C	is it? yeah
A	font sizes
C	mm
B	and also things like sort of grades and results you might want to try and consider putting them side to side so you don't waste any space having them down
C	mm
B	yeah
A	in a list yeah
B	and there's just this area without anything on it
C	yeah
B	it is so
C	yes
D	well it does it's tricks of the trade really
B	I have to sort of sort out text boxes and that type of thing
C	mm
B	and also you don't want it to look as though you have used a text box so you've got to move the
A	the lines yeah
B	the line
C	oh yeah
B	sometimes I do a little erm
A	like a grid isn't it?
B	a grid to ensure it's perfectly in line and then obviously remove the grid lines so
C	mm
B	so it doesn't look as though you've been
D	yeah this is it it's er
B	there is
D	you've just got to hit on the
B	mm
C	so when do you present that then
B	erm well it's basically just going through it with my tutor tomorrow and then when you apply for any internships or jobs then that's what you would send along with a covering letter
C	oh right
B	the covering letter would have to be more tailored to what you're applying for
C	yes I see
B	so it's a bit hard to do that in advance
C	mm yeah
A	just trying to get forearmed aren't you
C	mm yeah
B	there's been some placements they might might be open for two months or something the application period
C	mm
B	but if they start selecting after the first seven to ten days
C	mm
B	you've a better chance if you get it in the couple of first few days it's open rather than the day before it closes
A	mm
C	mm
A	yeah
D	oh did you?
B	yes mm yes
C	oh did you yeah yes?
A	and I bought these three Noddy cars they were ten pence each so that was a thirty pence stake
D	mm hm
B	yes so the person
C	really?
A	we put them on for fifteen pounds
C	yes
A	and then they had to pay fifteen pounds post to Australia
C	oh heavens
A	I can't see how it's worth it do you?
D	well
A	I just hope they're what he thinks they are because we don't want to send them back all that way do we?
C	no
A	I can't believe it
D	that's that's
A	that's incredible
D	mm
A	an eccentric
D	mm
A	somebody eccentric
B	well it's a Polish name
C	oh is it?
B	yeah
A	a Polish person living in Australia sending to Yorkshire for Noddy Cars
C	yeah
C	what was that game we got
D	when we went where
C	what was that game we bought?
D	oh
C	what was it?
D	when we got those when you brought me back and said
C	yeah
D	and it was those books on
C	no no oh it's gone
D	business accounting or something
C	yeah
D	then
C	yes
D	yeah
C	I
D	yeah
C	I don't know
D	mm
C	mm
D	I just might be wrong on this bit but it
C	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker D might be right or wrong.	Entailment
D	so you know it's a pretty old one
C	mm
D	but it's all there
C	no
D	er
C	it's a small box a smallish box
D	mm
C	I can't remember what it is now
A	yes he did use those books actually
C	oh right
A	I think the same night
[ANNOTATION]	He was using some books at night.	Entailment
C	oh yes
A	erm he had a question about how
C	mm
A	but we didn't really know what it was
C	oh right
A	so we couldn't say
C	no no
[ANNOTATION]	He was using the books to shim the table.	Neutral
A	and then we found it in that book
C	oh really?
D	what that
A	mm
D	yeah
B	one
D	mm
C	yeah
B	it goes into a lot of detail and it can be quite hard to just
C	pick out what
B	find exactly what you're looking for
[ANNOTATION]	The book does not talk about types of boxes in much detail.	Neutral
A	I think it presupposes that you've got a lot of background already
D	yeah
A	and if you haven't
[ANNOTATION]	The book is for beginners and assumes you know nothing about it.	Contradiction
D	yeah
A	you don't know
C	you can't
D	but the thing is you can't have it all
A	understand the relevance
C	no
D	you can't have it all and so
C	mm just to tell you what it is in the first place
[ANNOTATION]	The book is rather simple and vague.	Contradiction
D	you know with
A	yeah
C	well that's good anyway isn't it?
D	yeah
A	mm yeah yeah it's good
D	because they're only fifty P each
A	mm
D	mm we said well they're er
A	so they're really pleased
D	the paperbacks are fifty P all paperbacks are fifty P
C	yeah they're brand new
B	mm
D	that's
C	sound quite
D	oh yes I said we'll take them because if he doesn't want them we can always bring them back we won't chuck them sort of thing like but er
C	no
D	and these terms
C	mm
D	you know you probably don't understand the question
A	yes
D	or whatever it is now when we watch a few quizzes really don't we?
A	mm
D	and very often we look at each other and I say well
A	no
C	we we even watch University Challenge
D	mm hm
C	and
A	yeah
D	mm
A	you forget the first bit
C	you you yeah
D	yeah can't even
C	yeah
A	oh yes especially if they don't
C	oh yes we
A	fancy not knowing that that's disgraceful
C	yeah
D	yeah yeah
A	I know that's what I was saying
D	mm ha ha ha
D	and you say
D	what is the name of the valley between
A	you want a
C	well you asked me a question on the way here and I didn't
A	mm
C	cos there's quite a few now aren't there you know
A	mm yes they look good
C	some really good groups of them and
A	mm
C	your dad said oh which erm
A	poet
D	aye they're coming out all the dafs there
C	we knew no we knew the poet
D	and of course it bursts into poetry doesn't it?
A	mm hm
C	yes we knew who the poet was
D	altogether now beside the lake beneath the trees rustling and dancing in the breeze
C	beneath the trees rustling and dancing in the breeze
D	the question being what lake was it?
A	Windermere?
C	no that's what dad said
A	no?
D	they all go for Windermere don't they?
C	they all go for Windermere
D	mm mm
A	they all go for Windermere but it is one in the Lake District is it?
C	mm
A	Ullswater
C	yes
D	Ullswater yes mm
A	that's good cos I only know two
D	er there's Derwent
A	what's the third one Derwent?
D	Derwent
A	mm mm mm
D	cos coming I said
A	host of
D	and now then
A	lonely as a cloud well if
A	mm
D	quite an interesting book actually on
A	yeah
D	I didn't know there was all names like that
A	no
D	no
A	do you mean the different categories like Seraphim and Teraphim
C	mm yes
D	er Gabriel angel archangel Gabriel
A	oh you mean specific individual angels?
D	mm
A	oh right
D	mm
A	well you just said it was categories before
D	it was
A	I said is it categories like Seraphim and Teraphim or is it individuals like Gabriel?
D	yeah the they are named mm and it's more than once it comes in?
A	individuals?
D	mm
A	yeah
C	like Fred and you know angel Fred and all that sort of thing
D	there's no angel Fred there
C	well you know what I mean
D	we're trying to have an intelligent combination conversation and you come up with like angel Fred
A	I think I only know Gabriel as an individual
D	mm
A	go on
D	no
A	before you read that book
C	yeah
A	I mean generally
C	I don't remember any more anyway
A	mm
D	I'm going to look in the at the back to see if it whether it mentions something on the page
A	oh right
D	it was going to be announcement at er eleven o'clock or something
A	yeah
D	and er
A	what have you done with your old one?
D	well
D	I think it could be a woman
A	oh yes bound to be
D	yes
A	mm
D	mm
A	mm hm
D	mm hm
A	do you want to go to
C	oh yes could do mm
A	just to see
C	mm it's a nice day isn't it?
A	they're getting the more summer well they've got summer dresses in
C	have they?
A	yes
C	oh yeah
A	sleeveless things
C	yeah
A	no I can't picture it yet
D	mm
A	of putty that's another one
C	mm
C	is Michael one?
A	that's a saint isn't it?
C	a saint yeah
A	they've let that chap out on bail now that the erm
C	oh they were saying about that on the way here we wondered how that was going on
D	mm
A	he's out on bail
D	mm
A	but it said he can't be erm identified by the press they mustn't say where he lives or where he works or
D	he's not far away from there is he?
A	no
C	know yes
D	know where it were mm
A	which house it is for sure
D	oh they'll know
A	yes
D	mm
A	we don't know but lots of people will know
D	it's just
A	publicised
D	yeah
A	but there was a photograph of the house wasn't there?
B	yes
A	mm didn't say what number but it wouldn't take too much
C	mm
D	no
A	deduction
C	mm
D	mm mind you one is still on bail though isn't it?
A	I don't know
D	yes one is one has been sort of cleared but this other is still on bail
C	mm
A	mm
C	it must be
A	I know
C	no I don't
A	mm
C	but not to know where she is
A	I know
C	that's that's
A	mm I think the implication is it might be more than one place as well
C	mm
D	mm
A	they might not never know I don't know
C	no and that's that's as you say you can hardly live with that can you?
A	no
D	when
C	mm
A	terrible
D	that's how good it is
D	that's the other kind of the of the ladder and that
A	no but I can't start making some of the things
D	that's where it comes form
A	you know I can start making some of the elements
D	but I haven't found a
C	yeah
A	for next time you just put them in a box and
C	yeah and you can pick it up again
D	and that started to give the
A	yeah yeah
D	order of rank you know like in duke's marquis and their lords
C	because you you must use loads of bits and pieces
A	yes yeah
D	you know and that'll take a thing to give up your status
C	little
A	yeah
C	did you get another erm
A	no I need one
D	the kind would be there
C	yeah
D	the next would be dukes
A	yeah just broken through wear
C	mm you've had it quite a while haven't you?
D	and the next would be the earls you know and it comes down the table right down to right at the end is the lowest rank whoever they may be like
B	a hierarchy
D	but you know it would come out as you pick it out
A	no I think it's the
D	er
C	what?
D	about this Dutchman who
A	mm
D	which is a you know quite a serious
A	deficiency mm
D	infliction like er
A	oh yes
C	mm
A	I think is it if you have white rice you don't get all the nutrients but if you have brown rice you do
D	mm
C	and there's a difference between the polished rice as well isn't there?
D	but it cured this
A	yeah
D	which
A	yes and quite simple to solve once you know how or what
D	exactly
C	mm
D	and said er how we come to rickets
A	yes vitamin D
C	and where do we get our vitamin D from?
A	mainly the sunshine
D	milk
A	if you can get it
D	milk
A	mm yes
D	is a is a strong one and in particularly in the north of England
A	yeah
D	I mean when I made that joke er
A	mm
D	we have five well four
A	yes
D	and there was a an order
D	mm?
C	reserved occupation
D	er well it would be a reserved occupation yes but they'd had a and they there was an order and it was er it was the direction of labour order
C	mm
D	and these four from Leeds was directed to East Yorkshire water services at Hull
A	mm
D	to work there
A	yeah
D	transport getting people to the factories and to work and to Brough and all that business you see
A	mm
D	and they was all a bit bow-legged
A	mm
D	and then just to cap it all
A	mm
D	er as time went on they never went back to Leeds by the way they stayed
A	mm
D	you know
A	and beriberi
D	and that beriberi
[ANNOTATION]	Someone never went back to Leeds.	Entailment
C	anaemia
D	er anaemic
A	mm
D	iron
A	short of iron yeah
D	yes so you look for your source of iron now my mother
[ANNOTATION]	Someone has an iron deficiency.	Entailment
A	gosh
D	that was considered the
A	wouldn't a bottle of Guinness have pepped her up more?
D	well she used to have that as well like mm
C	mm
D	when they tested my blood they said you're a bit low on iron it wanted to be
A	mm
D	and I was about eight
A	mm
D	mm
A	yeah
D	er and that's when I got that book with all these things in
A	yeah
D	and what was good on vitamins and all that
[ANNOTATION]	Someone had a blood test.	Entailment
A	yeah
D	and it came out that funnily enough I you know you could hardly believe it one of the sources which is really strong in iron is er watercress
A	mm
B	and spinach
[ANNOTATION]	Watercress is a good source of iron.	Entailment
D	now who would think watercress?
A	mm
D	but it said by all means cultivated watercress
C	no
D	because that water
A	might not be
D	by now will be polluted
[ANNOTATION]	Someone likes eating watercress.	Neutral
A	mm
D	it'll have
A	mm
D	you know from the water
A	yeah
D	somewhere along the line it might even just be swimming baths
A	yeah
D	you know stuff like that
A	horrible
D	er so supposed to be so healthy
A	mm
D	and so innocent and yet
A	yeah athlete's foot
D	you know oh dear oh dear
C	mm mm
D	you know that that just a start
A	mm
D	but er
C	and diabetes
D	mm?
C	diabetes
D	diabetes
C	no I don't know
D	no
A	mm
D	which are just like vitamins in your ordinary food
A	yes
C	mm
D	er
A	much importance
D	importance to them
A	mm
D	and you can still go yeah there was another one I'm surprised you haven't told me about it scurvy
A	oh yes
D	er particularly er
A	mm
D	cos you see when they went on these voyages these long voyages I mean you're talking about er maybe four months to get to Australia
A	mm
D	and they used to take with them on board er er
C	yes
D	er they'd they'd take pigs with them and a goat
A	mm
D	and feed it what they could
A	yes
D	but careful like you know
A	mm
D	to give them
A	mm
D	er and when they used to go to some of these islands they would go back and put er a couple of pigs obviously male and female on to this island
A	yes
D	and chart it
A	mm
D	so when they came back
A	yes and try and catch
D	there'd probably be thirty or forty pigs running around now and that's where they got the
A	mm
D	yes this is it because there's a lot on there's nothing wasted on a pig and I bet they didn't
A	no
D	so scurvy and that was the limes for a start and that's why the Aussie's call us Limeys from the limes because it was from
A	mm
D	the vitamin C
A	mm
D	er
A	oh yeah
C	mm what was that for?
D	do you remember that?
C	yes
D	and it's
A	was that potassium?
D	mm?
A	was it potassium?
D	er
C	yes
D	yeah it was
C	potassium
D	it's yes but it's something with beginning with F really
C	maybe that's potassium the way you spell it
D	yeah
D	cos I laughed I said good grief you're going to be swinging from the chandeliers
A	mm
D	soon if you're having er six or seven bananas
A	well it's not practical is it?
A	if you have one a day
