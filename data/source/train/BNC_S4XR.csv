A	so if you pass somebody on the street in Northern Ireland you there's that same sort of shake of the head sort of like a
B	mm mm
B	I see that you are there
B	yeah
A	yeah
A	but actually that's
A	or at least make eye contact with people

A	and I find even where I live where you would expect that anybody you're passing is a neighbour within
B	yeah
A	a two-minute walk
B	yeah
A	it just doesn't happen so
B	I
B	why do they do that?

A	worked in the business world I climbed the ladder
B	mm
A	erm
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A doesn't know about business.	Contradiction
B	mm mm
A	part of the
B	yeah but no but
A	since I ticked the opt out box on the rat race I don't think I've ever been happier and I certainly haven't
B	yeah
A	ever had a period in life as I've had in the last two or three years where I'm learning so much about myself
B	mm mm
A	I think it's part of that freedom and part of that being so open to everything and anything
B	yeah
A	hooray
B	I sort of said from the beginning
A	good for you
B	erm my friend er is just
A	mm
B	so the first article was about er people who are teaching English as a foreign language abroad so he's interviewed me and a friend who lives in Spain and another friend who lives somewhere else
B	er so I've just decided never to do it
A	yeah
B	then we all said in these interviews you know like
A	yeah
B	yeah it's a job like any job
A	mm
B	erm and sometimes you know you're sat in your room watching Iplayer wondering if it's all worth it when you're so far from your family
A	mm
B	erm but the
A	yeah
B	this sort of job erm
A	aha
B	and in the summers when you're working in England you're like touching base with other people who do
A	yeah
B	have the same feelings that there's more to it than
A	yeah nine to five rat race
B	nine to five yeah
A	and is part of that
B	mm mm
A	mm
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	and even here I'm thinking there's gotta be more

B	goodness me
B	fucking what next?
B	er yeah so
A	mm

A	I yeah I think a more key question
B	yeah am I happy?
A	absolutely yeah
B	er
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	touch base time
A	yeah
A	yeah but I think there's no harm in having a focus on where am I here now?
B	mm mm
B	yeah
A	and change partners okay
B	yeah
A	no it is good to question
B	mm mm
A	and gratitude plays a big part for me
B	mm mm
A	what do I love about here now? what do I love about
