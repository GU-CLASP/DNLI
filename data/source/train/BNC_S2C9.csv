A	exactly
B	that's just that's unfortunately that's the nature of the beast innit?
A	exactly or we
B	I have the same we have the same trouble with a with like a big group of us
A	yeah
B	there's only three of us
A	yeah
B	and there was another lad that we knew from uni that
A	yeah
B	than I did but he was still my year but you know
A	yeah
B	erm but we're like now I'm still gonna do it cos if you don't you just don't see each other
A	exactly and that's like we go months and months and months without seeing each other so like
B	sorry
A	sorry
B	you'd like try to see them
A	yeah and not a single one like it's an hour on the train they've got no excuse
B	an hour's really not that far is it?
A	no and like I appreciate that everybody has their own thing going on but like to say that not a single one of them has given me a single weekend do you know what I mean? or even like popped up for the day like
B	yeah
A	pathetic
[ANNOTATION]	person B is talking about football	Contradiction
B	and they could do couldn't they?
A	they could so easily like
B	just have some lunch and go home
A	exactly
B	it's really cheap as well on the train
A	that's what I've said to
B	yeah
A	cos that's the other thing you know like
B	and then they'd say let's go out for dinner
A	yeah and then I have to pay for dinner and everything as well so when I went in April last year I spent seventy pounds in one day just to go and see them and I'm like that's so expensive like
[ANNOTATION]	Someone paid for an expensive dinner	Entailment
B	it's the
A	it's stupid it's so expensive and like
B	I think it's the I think that's the mentality of the of people that live there isn't it?
A	I know and I just think like
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about school	Contradiction
B	yeah
A	so
B	it's yeah
A	but never mind
B	that's like erm it's like I was up here having conversations with erm
B	er cos er if I remember who it is erm it might have a relevance but it might be anyway talking about how people are paying for things and like erm one of the or some of the one of the lads now got married in in America
A	yeah
B	you're gonna be the ushers yeah like sweet ushers like rock over rocked over made them pay for the suit hire suit hire
A	even though they had flights to pay for as well
[ANNOTATION]	person A is not sure that they had flights	Neutral
B	and for all the way to er New York for him and one of them's a lecturer so he had to like wing work off
A	oh right yeah
B	cos she
A	er I don't really
B	is the er is the thing coming up? er oh yeah no I did hear actually about it
A	yeah hen do is
[ANNOTATION]	person A know what happend	Neutral
B	the hen do
A	in June erm it's all a bit annoying to be honest I
B	it was going to be it's
A	yeah like it's a bit awkward cos like what's happened is that
B	expensive
A	it's quite expensive so people are paying like a hundred quid a hundred and something quid for three nights in this place right? and obviously people are also having to book time off work and they're having to book the Friday and the Monday off work erm
B	like oh shit that's that's my idea
A	exactly so it's just a bit awkward so erm
B	yeah
A	erm
B	that could be nice though
A	I think so I mean what I don't really understand is like
B	or
A	do what you like
B	you can do what you like
A	yeah
B	you you can go away and
A	and I think you need to do that for a whole weekend like you can't plan like forty-eight fifty-eight odd hours' worth of entertainment it's stupid you might as well say like oh so this morning like erm you can do whatever you like here's a couple of things you could do in the local area or you can just do whatever you want but like what they've done is they've picked the cottage because it's pretty and they've not really looked at the location so what they've done is booked the place and then looked at the location and thought oh
B	shit there's nothing there
A	there's nothing here
B	but
A	apart from this quad biking yeah nothing
B	in that situation again what I would do is I'd take I'd
A	yeah
B	everyone can have what they want of that
A	sandwich fillings
B	just sandwich filling
A	yeah
B	and they can just make that and for and for tea you just do like buffet
A	yeah or you could even like cos there's fifteen of us you could just like divide people into groups and sort of say right on night one these people are cooking so
A	cos like
B	I can imagine them hating life
A	yeah and like
A	yeah and you just think like it's
B	not the most outgoing group of girls
A	no
B	with you lot with your girls
A	yeah
B	then I would
A	you could see it
B	cos it would just be bad like
A	exactly
B	they'd just they'd just like take the piss out of him
A	it's just not the right group of people at all and it's just
B	is it gonna happen?
A	I don't know I think they've actually opted for a butler in the buff which I think is actually more awkward so some mate who's gonna serve us cocktails naked or with a like a little apron on
A	it's so weird
B	so we're going to we're doing a similar sort of thing for
A	what? a butler in the buff?
B	yeah that's it
B	no we'll get a stripper
B	that's what is it? or was I I just literally made that up
A	I was gonna say I hope not
B	erm we're going to
A	oh that'll be nice yeah
B	so all all her friends in the couples are all going
A	that's quite cute
B	er so that'll be good so we're we're going that sort of
A	yeah
B	I think we we're paying
A	for
[ANNOTATION]	there will be payment duties	Entailment
B	so I think
A	so what is it? at the end of next month is it?
B	yeah in the March
A	yeah
B	host-ish
A	I know
B	it's a bit weird innit?
A	how many of you is there?
B	there's fifteen of us going
A	that's quite a lot so who's the odd one out?
B	er I think there's a few
A	oh okay so it's not everybody who's in couples?
[ANNOTATION]	there will obligation to pay for something	Neutral
B	no
A	okay
B	or the
A	yeah
B	it's not
A	yeah
B	do things like all the time so
[ANNOTATION]	exactly fifteen people are going	Neutral
A	fair enough
B	so that's in March in
A	that'll be nice yeah
[ANNOTATION]	next month is March	Entailment
B	actually no it's not I've got work on the Monday and Tuesday
B	it's a
A	nice little relaxing weekend though yeah
B	yeah it'll be good
A	erm potentially erm
B	seen the line-up for
A	mm?
B	seen the line-up for

B	I didn't know how bothered you'd be
[ANNOTATION]	the event will be on a Saturday	Neutral
A	what?
B	don't know how bothered you'd be if you want some

A	really?
B	you'll see in a minute yeah
A	I'm excited now cos like I I've bought these tickets

A	and then realised I'm not actually gonna be able to tell him for like five months so I'm gonna get really excited
B	yeah so like so you will keep like this is under the
A	oh yeah
B	so you walk in through there that's the upper stadium
A	go through it
B	the way down there and then you walk like round the side of the stadium past like these places and
A	yeah
B	so
A	really?
B	it's such a long walk
A	yeah
B	some bars going we well we got there well early and you like walk and then round the back er but again round the side and get
B	all the way round here and like at this time it's boiling hot
A	yeah
B	and we're like
A	sweating your arse off
B	and like we dumped our drinks we liked necked them earlier
B	and they like put all flags up everywhere so you're walking in
A	oh that's cool
B	and then the gig
A	yeah
B	so it's not muddy or anything
A	that's good
B	so even if it was raining
A	it's fine
B	and then the stadium's there and I imagine
A	yeah
B	like so much so that I had to take my shirt off
B	I was dripping
A	well I'm excited cos we went to Bestival last year and we weren't that impressed like the music wasn't that good and like I think I'm over the whole like camping and living like a hobo for like a long weekend
B	well this it's literally the
A	so this is nicer isn't it?
B	so there's like there's literally there's like bars and places to eat all down the side and there's there's
B	but we were just like obviously into
A	but like yeah
B	into the music
A	I think this this one's got like they've got like massive food halls and all this kind of stuff as well so like we could get our munch on and I'm like
B	it's fucking expensive in there
A	is it?
B	yeah
A	I don't I don't doubt that but I'm really really chuffed
B	we
A	yeah
B	so like we er went to er
A	yeah
B	got a salad bar for the day just tucked into that had like crisps and just little munchies all the day and everyone was like walking around with these fat burgers going fucking hell it cost me twelve quid
A	feeling really smug
B	but like you can that sort of thing like you do that sort of thing
A	yeah
B	like you could take backpacks in and everything and
A	that's good
B	erm so that's great shout for you
A	good I'm very excited it was it was it was a complete fluke that I stumbled across it it's not like I normally plan
B	no and we do exactly the same
A	yeah
B	like proper random
A	yeah
B	because we
A	yeah
B	like I we're together best day I've ever had
A	oh I like the sound of
B	who's headlining? cos I reckon
A	do you think?
B	yeah
A	well they're the only two announced at the moment but
B	exactly
A	yeah erm and so they're they're announcing more so I'm quite excited but that that's totally our vibe like it's totally our kind of music
B	I know
A	so I'm really excited
B	we we saw erm
A	yeah you said yeah
B	at a gig oh mate it was the best gig
A	really?
B	well it wasn't the best gig but like it was quality it was so good
A	yeah
B	saw them we went down
A	in Corn Exchange? no in one of them then
A	okay
B	sorry I I did that all weekend as well like
A	really?
B	yeah where
B	shit shit Oxford
A	oh right okay
B	I think it's tiny like
A	yeah
B	no more than three hundred people in there
A	maybe was it like of the stage?
B	yeah like
A	yeah I think so
B	dead close
A	yeah
B	like as in we're that close
A	yeah that's cool isn't it?
B	so that was that was seriously cool
A	yeah
B	and like wherever you'd have stood it was it was good
A	you could actually see
B	and then they did an encore okay and we're stood in the middle of the crowd
A	that's cool
B	that was literally the coolest so we and we'd loved them like we saw them at at the er
A	yeah
B	and I was like no I'm doing like it's gonna be a band like that nobody had really heard of that I'm just gonna listen to a lot of and
A	yeah
B	and like I'm I'm I love them
A	that's really good
B	and it was literally class like really really good and like there was so much so cos it was a small gig and they were getting a bit of heckling and they were like
A	yeah
B	bouncing it back and then somebody I don't know how it worked but somebody like mentioned earlier like about
A	yeah
B	gotta
A	that's hilarious
B	so he's like
A	yeah
B	and then somebody like yeah
A	didn't know
B	no one knew so someone got it up on Google
A	yeah
A	that's so good
B	and he mixed it with another song
A	yeah
B	er so like
A	yeah
B	but they're really quite
A	yeah
B	just these three lads but one plays the banjo sometimes there's three and
A	that's quite cool
B	there's three and it's like three guitars
A	yeah
B	you should listen to them
A	yeah I'll have to
B	their I think their album's only like eight quid
A	really?
B	on erm on on Itunes
A	yeah
B	er and just proper we proper got into them er and it was class and we think we're gonna get we could get er another gig of theirs for cheap before they go over fifteen quid
A	big yeah
B	so we think we've got like
A	yeah I'm glad you saw him when he was small
B	like he rock he rocks it like and
A	yeah
B	but
A	I remember you going
B	like it wasn't er yeah cos I
A	yeah
B	didn't I? but I saw him just as he was like being absolutely
A	breaking yeah
B	nailed on the radio
A	yeah
B	a couple of months back
A	yeah
B	get
A	yeah it's a weird one isn't it? cos when you find a band that you like you're like you almost don't wanna share them like obviously you want them to be successful but like
B	no
A	yeah
B	like obviously you can hear everyone singing
A	yeah
B	and like he can hear everyone shouting at him he's just like
A	yeah
B	and you know you can imagine the atmosphere and
A	and watching him with his like the whole the his whole performance is like how he can play with the pedal and like all that kind of stuff like it's not really like to me
[ANNOTATION]	Two people share their admiration for a music band and their performance.	Entailment
B	the stadium
A	it's not a stadium thing no
B	but it I don't think he likes it either
A	no
B	but it it but he
A	he needs
B	has to because
A	yeah
B	if it like the the amount for him is so big
A	yeah
B	and so great that he's almost like literally throwing money away if he
[ANNOTATION]	Two people believe the performer is throwing money away by performing at a large stadium.	Neutral
A	yeah
A	doesn't do it
B	how much how much he'd have to give for everyone
A	exactly
B	to see him? he'd be stupid going to Rock City
[ANNOTATION]	Two people agree that the performer should not go to perform in Rock City.	Entailment
A	yeah
B	like
A	exactly
B	he'd sell out five minutes you're thinking well I need to play somewhere bigger
A	yeah
B	and he's literally a stadium isn't he? so
A	I know he's huge now
B	so like I'm all about
A	yeah
B	price to actually get cos you like support bands are the ones
A	yeah
B	you that you like so you pay big to see someone big and like like right
A	yeah
B	like the first one on are they any good? like sweetness like
A	yeah
B	crack on
[ANNOTATION]	Two people converse and agree about how popular a performer has gotten.	Entailment
A	that's where you need to yeah
B	like I saw Scroobius Pip erm
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Two people saw the same performance.	Neutral
B	and then he
A	yeah
B	little things like that oh I mean I didn't really like like him but
A	but it's yeah but it's worth keeping your eye out with that kind of thing though but yeah we haven't we were so like unimpressed with Bestival like I'm I'm really like not that fussed about doing a festival this year
B	it's the longest day though
A	yeah I imagine like when I booked
[ANNOTATION]	Two people are not impressed with the potential music festival.	Entailment
B	but you is it is it a weekend?
A	it's a Sunday
B	oh is it?
A	mm
B	you might wanna take like well
A	no exactly but erm cos like part of me is a bit like oh you know if we stayed on the Sunday night we could just explore London the next day
B	we
A	a long day
B	feel like
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	basically
A	yeah
B	whereas like we went home like we got a
A	yeah
B	got up the next day we were like oh we're home Friday crack on
A	yeah
B	it was definitely the best thing to do coming home
A	yeah and like the last train back
B	and literally the last train back
A	yeah
B	and
A	rammed yeah
B	who's erm Fearne Cotton's the fella's then?
A	Ronnie Wood
B	yeah what's his band?
A	er The Stone? no
B	yeah
B	that's it they were playing in Hyde Park so like
A	oh Christ
B	you can imagine the state of the train?
A	yeah
A	but yeah erm
B	yeah
A	so we thought about maybe heading there over the summer but like it's probably like
B	that's pretty old school
A	if I know
A	exactly but if you're going to like if you're going to the UK you kind of need to go like June like July or August September cos you want it you want to take a stab at it being warm don't you? erm
B	and you almost have to
A	exactly
B	things to do
A	no
B	but you're like it's nice to
A	and it's sort of but the thing is it's such a big journey down there for like we've ummed and ahhed about it but we can't really pinpoint like whether we'd go
B	trouble is
A	for the same price
B	for a week for the same price
A	yeah like we for five nights like when I first had a look for five nights like self-catered in
B	it what five or six hundred pound for the couple?
A	we yeah it's
B	all inclusive
A	all inclusive
B	so
A	yeah
B	five hundred quid
A	you can
B	all in like
A	yeah
B	er we were at a self-catering as well so like I found hotels
A	yeah
B	hire car
A	yeah
B	so then you're like well I might as well
[ANNOTATION]	All inclusive costed five hundred quid	Entailment
A	yeah
B	cos you'll have you'll have dinner you're like
A	we're going to erm we're going to Copenhagen in a couple of
B	yeah?
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A has a trip to Copenhagen coming up	Entailment
A	with some of his mates and it's literally cost us like forty quid for the flights and like eighty quid each for the accommodation three nights three days
B	and why wouldn't you?
A	exactly
B	that'll be class
A	so I don't know
B	and like used to do that Amsterdam
A	yeah
B	almost you you can do it even if you're
A	I think we're gonna do a few more trips like that hopefully this year like do like long weekends because they just seem to be like you can do it's a long enough time away to feel like you're doing something but
B	yeah and and you only have to have two days off work
A	exactly
B	and
A	cos the thing is with the like it sounds really depressing but when you take like a whole week off to go abroad like you are knackered when you get back because like you've taken five days off work but you've been away for seven
[ANNOTATION]	Long weekend trips are exhausting compared to week-long trips	Contradiction
B	and you've probably just got back
A	yeah
B	so like
A	yeah you've literally just got back and then you've got to go straight back to work
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Leaving work to travel for a week then immediately going back to work is not ideal	Entailment
A	it's like oh okay
B	yeah I know you almost need a few more days to
A	exactly
B	to recover
A	so no I don't know what our holiday plans are
B	we I'm going to Budapest on the stag do I'll let you know what that's like because that's supposed to be like really nice
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B will be travelling to Budapest	Entailment
B	and like I don't know how much of it I'll see
B	I'll be able to tell you what the bars are like
A	when when do you go there?
B	same time so probably the same weekend as you're going
A	oh really? end of April
B	end of April but is it the
A	twenty-third?
B	twenty-fourth? yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B will not be visiting bars when they travel	Contradiction
A	yeah
B	twenty-fourth twenty-
A	twenty-third to the twenty-seventh
B	yeah I've obviously told you did I tell you about those flights that we got?
A	no
B	so
A	yeah
B	and er this lad from uni he lives in
A	yeah
B	and but most of his mates are so we were like right we'll sort our own flights out
A	yeah
B	fine so they they were coming out with flights that were like that just sounds ridiculously expensive like
A	yeah
B	none of that so like sweet so we're going Friday Saturday and come back Sunday bit like so
A	yeah
B	flight's Friday morning
A	yeah
B	no yeah January shit we've left this way too late lads like
A	for a flight?
B	for a flight
A	oh god yeah
B	it was only costing us a hundred and
A	for the accommodation
B	for accommodation activities
A	yeah
B	like stag dos are really expensive oh shit what are we gonna do? so we're like fuck it we have to do something extreme so
B	we were just missing a day on the Sunday
A	yeah
B	but like there's nothing more when you
A	everybody will just be like hungover and like moaning like a bitch anyway
B	when you've been boozing all weekend the last thing you want or need
A	sorry about that
B	in his room is he?
A	yeah it's er he says he
A	yeah
B	poor lad
A	I don't know whether it's cos we'd were walking at the weekend like it's
B	sat on a desk and he just
A	yeah but I don't know but I don't think he gets up much during his during the day which I think is his main problem because he gets so like
B	I literally can't I've never had a job or felt like that
A	no well he's I don't really get it like I don't
B	it'll stiff up
A	I know so I don't know
B	bless him
A	bless him indeed
B	yeah so
A	yeah
B	we shall see
A	yeah well
B	I mean like literally a few months before
A	well we're going er
B	and we literally saw him
A	yeah
B	but
A	you really like Ben Howard
A	yeah
B	she was like I really wanna go to this I was like
B	and his his birthday
A	his birthday's on the fourth of July so I'm literally like gonna give them to him like a week before we go
A	I know
B	well I've obviously got mine
A	I know
B	I'm er November and we're not not going till
A	April
B	er I could've er given her for her birthday
A	yeah
B	in in March but I was like I'm not
A	I know
B	lost through it
A	I know and I just keep thinking like he's gonna find out but then I don't think he will I think it'll be a really nice surprise cos he
B	mm
A	erm so fingers crossed
B	how's all the girls then?
A	yeah they're all pretty good
B	they were they there?
B	I don't know how
A	no I really don't like every story like even if I'm telling a story like I don't really feel like she's listening to my story she's just waiting for a moment to tell me a story
B	her next one
A	yeah a story that's kind of related but about her
B	oh yeah like me and
A	yeah really really intense but everybody else seems cool like
B	were they were they both there together?
B	what?
A	and
B	no way
A	and we're like oh just like oh god don't encourage this behaviour
B	mm I told
A	because it would be robbing you of your opportunity
B	yeah like
A	yeah
B	I've I I genuinely think about it a lot
A	yeah
B	and when it's gonna happen it'll happen like
A	yeah
B	I'd be like
A	yeah
B	yeah but er she knows that I'd be gutted
A	yeah I would I'd never think about doing it
B	it's just
A	mainly cos they were saying
B	weird
A	I wouldn't wanna do it until I know he's ready like
B	but it's so it's the man's decision
A	yeah I found it
B	but it's not clearly
A	he's he's the one that needs to come to terms with it so it's like
B	anyhow
A	so that's a bit of a weird one
B	it's weird
A	yeah and anyway they're both fine they've been losing weight and they've been going to the gym
B	did they did they erm come and stay?
A	they came for it was everybody but
B	oh no not again
A	she keeps doing it to herself though
B	she can't help herself
A	no I said
B	like loads of times she can't help
A	no I said to her a few weeks ago me and me and her went to see
B	that's like
A	like oh okay
B	booked
A	well booked yeah erm so apparently
B	right
A	so you know they're obviously going to the wedding and then they're gonna fly over to Sydney? well apparently

A	erm like
B	right
A	they're going over to some sort of wedding
B	they're going to Australia anyway
A	yeah
B	and they were like right well we might as well
A	yeah
B	go and enjoy it
A	so they're going to this wedding first
B	yeah
A	and then like they're planning to fly over to Sydney and do other things or whatever
B	okay
A	erm so apparently
B	with somebody else
A	yeah
A	family holiday with her family
B	I feel like she's a bit stuck sometimes
A	yeah but she doesn't she doesn't seem to like stick up for herself in that respect
B	no
A	but like
B	but like she's never done that
A	no
B	we know she's not she you know she just does easy life
A	like I like
B	no
A	necessarily he's still very much
B	yeah
A	whereas like I think she like she's genuinely built up relationships with his family and his friends and stuff
B	so
A	yeah
B	and don't ever do anything well you'll probably have to but you'll
A	yeah
B	she's a bit of a character
A	erm but yeah and I just think like
B	she's
A	she's just not bothered
B	she and she's given up
A	yeah she's just she's distanced herself so much though like since she got with
B	yeah she she did but then like
A	oh with
B	well just
A	oh with the
B	yeah just generally just being like
A	yeah
B	generally rude
A	yeah I'm just gonna check dinner sorry
B	like cos yes if
A	sorry you were saying?
B	like if somebody doesn't make an effort
A	yeah
B	like I don't but I go
A	yeah
B	I'm gonna really like
A	yeah
B	as a friend you know cos that's what you
A	yeah
B	I dunno that's just er the way the way it'll work and I'm sure you'll be the same like even if you were thinking oh fucking hell like
A	yeah
B	any chance that first time you met or
A	quite rude
B	rude
A	yeah
B	and erm
A	mm
B	I I can't be bothered with them being the way they are
A	I'm a little bit worried for her just in that though like
B	and I can understand why yeah
A	I I don't wanna mess around and stuff but my fear is that
B	me and you and
A	me
A	yeah
B	but then then you think
A	yeah I suppose
B	do you know know what I mean? like think about
A	yeah
B	like me
A	cool
B	but that might be different but
A	I
B	no not at all
A	never like I I've never
B	I remember the time I remember a time when erm when
A	no and I
B	and that just says it all
A	I I'm never the target of anything
B	no
A	like and like I know that sounds stupid because
B	well er they clearly don't
A	and erm I love having them around and I I like the fact that they're sounds really bad but they're there in the background so if I want them they're there
B	yeah
A	but if I don't have time for them then I don't have time for them but so I couldn't imagine just like cutting myself off from them completely and I actually really enjoy spending time with them
B	well that's good yeah
A	but I'm just a bit I feel sorry for
B	she's their the
A	yeah and also like I think she's almost it sounds really stupid but like by sort of saying like oh I can't be bothered with it but then turning up every so often she makes it almost worse for herself because like
B	yeah
A	the time that she does turn up like she'll like she and maybe rightly so she kind of expects people to care that she's there but the people are just a bit like why should we care the one time you decide to turn up?
B	yeah I can understand
A	like it's
B	yeah but like
A	it looks bad
A	yeah
B	cos she she would cos she would just go yeah yeah I can't go and everyone will go oh shock
A	yeah
B	like oh my god you can't even go to
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	it's awkward
B	it's it's not very nice but
A	I'm happy for her I just hope I hope
B	I hope because she's getting what you're er you're saying is she's getting in friendship circles with
A	yeah and I still don't trust him like I know he's a nice guy but I have serious reservations like
B	mm maybe so
A	and he's got too many people too close to him that would lie for him
B	yeah
A	I don't know how much you know erm
B	bet she never spoke to him
A	no so she never came to me and tell me told me what happened or whatever erm
B	but you're right to have that as a as a friend
A	yeah
B	you're allowed to have those reservations
A	and now she's talking about him proposing and all this kind of stuff and it's
B	really?
A	yeah erm I'll talk to you in a sec I'm just gonna plate up some food
B	I'll come
A	yeah
B	oh
A	so erm she was telling me that like she's mentioned it before that she thinks he might propose in Australia
B	oh yeah?
A	and I was like oh right okay so the end of this year alright okay
B	but you haven't
A	erm she said well
B	and he's how old? he's only like
A	he's having twenty-nine this year so
B	no twenty-seven
A	twenty-eight he's twenty-eight but he's twenty-eight in March
B	okay so he's
A	yeah so yeah so she thinks he'll want to incorporate this stag do with this trip to Vegas so that he can basically gets the Vegas stag do right? she also said he wants to have his first kid by the time he's like thirty or something
B	what?
A	so I was like oh right okay she like yeah so he wants to have a kid by the time he's like thirty thirty-one
B	that's fine
A	that's fine I was like
B	I think it's fine I think it's a quick decision er she said to me she said once to me she was just like
A	like they really seem like they haven't been together a year well they've been together six months when they started looking at houses that to me is really soon and then after that they were kind of they were moving in within the year
B	mm
A	erm
B	no
A	so shall I do an extra portion are you sure?
B	I
A	yeah well you're more than welcome erm you can eat the little bit here
B	no I'm fine really
A	yeah?
B	yeah I'll
A	well do you want to grab a plate for me then?
A	well according to her she it is like I obviously haven't spoken to him
B	yeah
A	yeah well
B	no no I don't want a piece
A	I know
B	you got any sauce?
A	erm what would you like?
B	erm I dunno I reckon
A	er
B	tomato probably
A	I've got some tomato
B	or at least erm
A	sweet and sour
B	sweet and sour yeah that's fine thank you
A	erm yeah so she seems to think it's definitely on the cards
B	oh my god
A	your card is up there
B	it is there?
A	but it might be up
B	do you know what? like I was for a minute I was cos
A	yeah no I definitely
B	I was like
A	I definitely got it
B	I really hope
A	if it's
B	it's in the right place
A	if it's not there it might be up here somewhere
B	yeah you've got it that's fine
B	I just had it in my head that
A	yeah no
B	into the wrong place
A	er it was here waiting for you when I got home
A	erm yeah like obviously I'd be I'd be supportive if they got married
B	yeah of course you would
A	and I do like it I do like the guy it's not like I have an agenda against him I'm just
B	that's you're allowed to be
A	mm
B	just to let you know I'm not cautious about
A	ta
A	but
B	what did you eat at
A	erm
B	did you?
A	yeah
A	I mean it is a bit of a weird menu like
B	especially if you don't wanna spend it's too high
A	yeah
B	I always feel that's a disappointing size
A	mm
B	you get a lot
A	exactly
B	and charging something like that
A	we erm
B	is
A	yeah not much I think like she's taking it in her stride to be fair
B	do you know any more about the sacking of
A	the what?
B	that
A	no
B	do you know about that no?
A	no
B	oh
A	I didn't hear anything about that
B	oh right
A	erm
B	yeah
A	you know how bitchy they are I think they're all like winding her up and like
B	exactly
A	telling her that she can't have other friends and all this kind of shit
A	no
B	obviously on days and nights off she does
A	I know but
A	yeah I think so and I think also like you know like
A	erm
B	I've not gone out in town for years well
A	they used to go out
B	about a year
A	fairly regularly
B	they're not
A	no
B	so how's
A	erm I have seen it but only briefly erm I picked her up
B	yeah
A	I haven't actually seen it
B	has
A	yeah I think so
B	is
A	mm
B	how's that been for her? I don't think it'll last personally but
A	I don't think she even wants it to last like I think it's keeping her occupied at the moment I think she likes having someone to spend time with
B	yeah
A	but I don't think I don't think he I don't even think she sees him as like long-term
B	boyfriend material
A	no
A	like even last night she was like
B	sounds cool
A	yeah and she was like oh don't remind me I'm twenty-five blah-blah-blah and I was like why do you care? like twenty-five is no worse than twenty-four is it? and then
B	only it's only a problem if everyone gives you stick about it
A	mm
B	this is amazing by the way
A	yeah erm well I was just thinking like if it bothered you now it's always gonna bother you
B	probably will yeah
A	so and she's made comments to me before like
B	and he is twenty
A	yeah
B	that's like if you think about what you were like
A	exactly
B	you were like your second year at uni
A	erm
B	cos he's got no like
A	yeah
A	exactly like she doesn't need someone who's gonna plan their future because she's just trying to work out stuff
B	hers
A	herself yeah
B	yeah
A	that'd be
B	yeah
A	so I think the I think they both pay like three hundred pound a month or something and that's their that's their mortgage and their bills so it's cheap for
B	yeah how would do you like
A	yeah
B	pay off my mortgage you can do it the option's there but I don't ever want to think like oh my god I you've got so much money and I haven't
A	yeah
B	how much is her mortgage then?
A	not a lot I don't think erm
B	right
A	so instead she's put it into
B	mm
A	in a in a way of like when you move out you can give me that money back with whatever interest it's earned
B	mm
A	so I think her mortgage is something like four hundred and fifty pound a month it's not a lot
B	so basically she's getting everything for free
[ANNOTATION]	She is literallly getting everything for free	Contradiction
A	yeah
B	and she won't be paying paid badly
A	no
B	is she?
A	cos I think she's obviously at a private school
A	erm
B	cos she's at private school that's what
[ANNOTATION]	A used to go to a private school	Neutral
A	she's also like obviously she doesn't do full-time
B	and
A	half the classes yeah
A	yeah
B	can't resent it
A	no
B	that looks like a
A	that's my little Valentine's present from
B	Valentine's?
A	yeah trying to fatten me up
A	massive

A	mm
B	we just can't have a relationship
A	which is a shame isn't it?
B	quite shit
A	cos you know you
B	I know I get seriously stressed
A	yeah
B	she's like what's wrong with you? I was like I just ah
A	mm
B	when he
A	yeah
B	with my brother I'd say look stop being a fucking dickhead
A	I think
B	or like her parents like literally pamper to it
A	really?
B	like he and
A	you don't have to reward him every time he does like
B	they
A	this thing yeah
B	it's like are you fucking joking? he's twenty
A	how old is he?
B	he she's nineteen he's
A	what does he do?
B	like
A	what do they do during the day?
B	he works does something similar to me
A	okay
B	and she doesn't work at the minute
A	okay
B	cos she she was working at Ikea and was gonna get sacked
A	cos that's
B	well they they said you're better off walking rather than being sacked
A	mm
B	so so
A	is the other side
B	is like the other side and we never noticed how thin the wall was until we moved the bed cos it used to be on like say that wall
A	yeah
B	and we moved it to here and like literally you can hear
A	no privacy
B	oh no and it's
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	and we
A	it's a means to an end
B	I said to her yesterday I said look we like I can't ever be like myself in terms of
A	yeah
B	like do silly things or be romantic or edge anything cos everyone knows about it and I don't want fucking everyone to know about it
A	I know what you mean
B	for
A	yeah
B	you're not gonna spout it
A	no
B	no or like
A	it's also it's it's like the silliest little things as well like
B	sit and just think
A	sit and be but like when you're when you're in a house full of people you can't just you can't just sit and be you can't just be
B	because you
A	yeah
A	no I doubt you are
B	but
A	but I know what you mean
B	like
A	no
B	I spend like if I was to go out I'd spend thirty
A	yeah
B	thirty quid
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	and like even little things like my washing right?
A	you know they're my socks yeah
B	they're mine yeah one was my favourite one as well my meerkat ones
A	so what does it does
A	wow
B	nobody like if you just he like they were getting really stressed out for him and now I think like they've had
A	yeah
B	erm they helped me out seriously man and like I need to spend time there I'm only twenty round and round and round and round yeah and now they spend all the time at
A	that's a lot of people for one house
B	I mean literally
A	yeah
B	like don't want a fucking cold car
A	yeah
B	and I yeah and I'm just like so
A	yeah
B	and
A	I'm not allowed to
B	what I'm feeling
A	yeah
A	that sounds horrible
B	but and er on the flipside
A	you're being looked after
B	I'm being well looked after I don't pay a thing I'm
A	mm
B	erm
A	yeah
B	the like term like over weekends gone I had like loads of costs come out accountancy
A	yeah
B	and I'm just like it's
A	yeah
B	no that's fine it's fine it's fine yeah but I can't live in this anymore
A	no
B	but like I go home and my tea will be ready a lot of time or I'll come home and there'll be the
A	yeah
B	I get
A	whatever you want
B	whatever I want yeah cos provide teas and
A	yeah
B	you know get a bottle of wine or something to say thanks or get some flowers
A	yeah
B	like
A	yeah
B	make sure the house is clean when they come home and cook when I when I can
A	it's a means to an end
B	I know
A	yeah
B	what I want? and but like but like it that's a stupid thing to think
A	yeah
B	well that's the other thing
A	yeah
B	I feel like it's a quite stressful environment my mum's obviously not gonna work for so long
A	yeah
B	she goes back this week so it's fine but like there's
A	yeah
B	in the way and it stresses me out a little bit
A	yeah
B	really clean
A	yeah
B	er it's like
A	yeah it's like almost not worth yeah
B	cleaning sometimes
A	stressing yeah
B	yeah so you just have to
A	yeah
B	and
A	yeah
B	sweet
A	it's stressful
B	it what it gets me like
A	yeah
B	oh
A	yeah
B	cos I'll do it
A	yeah
B	no I can't be like
A	yeah
B	like I know that you know and obviously and hers like it's like
A	yeah
B	oh man
A	it's lovely yeah
B	like we used to go like and I
A	yeah
A	I I I get like
B	now it's time to go
A	I'm I'm ready to go now yeah and
B	obviously there's a certain there's just a flipside to it yeah
A	just think like the
B	yeah
A	I'm sure
B	but
A	yeah exactly
B	split up go
A	yeah
B	everyone's like why the fuck did you do that for? I don't know why the fuck did I do that for? I go home and get stressed
A	exactly
B	and think what the fuck are you doing?
A	it'll be it I think it will be better as summer comes along as well because it's one of those things like during the winter everybody's in the house like
B	mm
A	just for a walk or whatever like
B	well we do we like
A	yeah
B	and yes I am busy
A	yeah
B	you know er at the weekend but she is very busy during the week like she gyms it
A	yeah
B	you know? it's not a problem that's the just the way I it works and we do lots together
A	and not do anything and not worry
B	well not not just that but if she goes to the gym comes back goes and has a shower sit down we just sit down in the living room and it's quiet and we just watch TV or
A	yeah
B	we just sit and chat
A	yeah
B	so she doesn't tell me
A	oh bless you
B	so I'm just gonna be quiet no but just I might be in a mood I'm just
A	yeah
B	oh and like oh I had a shit day
A	yeah
B	it literally drives me up the wall but
A	exactly
B	I'm running my business and I wouldn't be
A	mm
B	but like still living I'd be there for if I was
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	B did not have a good day.	Entailment
B	for like three or four years to save up for a house
A	saving is hard at the best of times though like I er I don't have any money left at the end of each month and every month I think where the fuck did all that go? like
B	yeah that's the thing with a house like I always feel like when you walk round the house
A	you can always justify it
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Saving for a house is not a quick matter.	Entailment
A	and you spend so much time here like it becomes your baby like I'd rather buy something for the house than buy something for me like it's really
B	yeah
A	fucking sad
B	but then eventually
A	I know
B	so you've brought everything for your house oh
A	yeah I don't really like that like cos I can already see like
[ANNOTATION]	Saving money is quite hard.	Entailment
B	the little shitty things
A	yeah
B	like doormats
A	yeah
B	oh that's a really nice doormat
A	exactly
B	oh classy
A	it's just never ending and
B	oh that's a really nice fork
A	I always find I always find like new jobs
[ANNOTATION]	The house they are saving for has a nice back garden.	Neutral
B	that's
A	but it takes time and you spend and it costs money
B	just think you'd rather that than
A	it's a
B	it's yours
A	like
B	this house is yours
[ANNOTATION]	Saving for a house is easy peasy.	Contradiction
A	yeah it is I forget that sometimes
B	this is you've paid out of your little pocket
A	yeah
B	somehow
A	but if feels like
A	yeah it feels like me as well
B	you've paid for it
[ANNOTATION]	B had a wonderful day filled with excitement.	Contradiction
A	I know I don't know how
B	it is yeah you get the feeling as soon as you walk in it's yours
A	yeah it feels like mine and like like
B	yeah
A	I'm like yeah my house looks like me like
B	yeah it's weird like that
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	do you?
B	yeah I really like it
A	yeah
B	yeah in summer I reckon it'll be really nice and sort of airy
A	cool and
B	yeah and and everything so I think it's really cool but then I look at some things you see like you
A	yeah
B	like you'll do it when I you
A	yeah
B	and go maybe like phew no I'm not sure I'd do that
A	yeah
B	mm not sure I'd do that
A	like I don't did she did she show you the wallpaper that
B	no
A	it's like a bookcase
B	oh okay yeah I know I've seen them
A	yeah
B	I know what you mean
A	so he wants like one of
B	really?
A	yeah he wants
B	oh that's really dark and dingy
A	yeah but er well it's not a it's not black and white it's like coloured
B	it's ah no I've seen them it
A	oh you've seen them?
B	I've seen a browny version
A	oh right maybe
B	like almost like old wood
A	yeah you know what I mean and it looks like a
B	like er almost like that that's what I'm reminded of that colour
A	yeah and it and it looks and it's got
B	3D
A	and it's got a load of books on it yeah
B	and it's 3D
A	he wants that apparently in the library and she like
A	no on their like you know as you walk through the door on the right-hand side?
B	yeah yeah
A	like I think they
B	that but the things
A	they've got
B	things like that
A	they've got a erm what have they got there? they've got like a little one of these
B	yeah I know
A	yeah
B	good good deal they got I know
A	yeah
B	hang something on it couldn't you?
A	yeah
B	but you or you could
A	yeah
B	or if you
A	yeah
B	in those ones when it's like almost
A	you can't really
B	you can't that's just a
A	yeah
B	dead wall there for me
A	I know
B	a bit odd
A	it's funny isn't it? like I
B	no
A	or like not like
B	they've got loads
A	yeah and I walk round her house and there's just photos of them everywhere and I'm like oh my god this is quite intense and then I look at
B	yeah there you go
A	pictures of myself plastered everywhere
B	there you go
A	but like that is
B	I like it
A	it's so
B	I I like it
A	do you? like having photos everywhere?
A	yeah yeah well not like I like the fact that they've got
A	yeah
B	cos it's just
A	see I have no problem with photos I think I don't like the fact that the photos are all of them
B	there is a lot
A	they're all they're all of them all of them
B	yeah I
A	but
B	I don't think that's a problem that
A	it it's a personal thing though isn't it?
B	er because they're not
A	I
B	they're they're not just photos of them at the house
A	yeah
B	they're actually doing things aren't they? but that's the person's taste isn't it?
A	yeah
B	cos they look at it and go oh that was a good holiday
A	yeah
B	or whatever
A	I want
B	that was a good day
A	me and
B	no
A	but she's always loved photos like even
B	oh massively
A	like even when she was at uni and stuff she always had loads of photos
B	yeah I
A	it's not it's not by no means a bad thing
B	no this this is this is
A	but yeah
B	I see what you're saying though
A	yeah
B	because you do go round and look at it and go oh shit that was good
A	yeah
B	do you remember that? and you see
A	I was thinking about this the other day though like I don't I don't remember the last time me and
B	you can only see can't you?
A	yeah
B	and if it doesn't
A	no
B	it's just like that's the friendship the way this friendship's gonna be then
A	exactly
B	well and you ain't gonna judge about it
A	no and the thing is
B	you're over-judging
A	you know what it is? you know what it's like with
B	no
A	so
B	no it's not and that that's what friendship
A	yeah
B	if that's what you both want out of it then you know great
A	yeah I suppose so
B	yeah
A	but then it also makes sense in as much as like she's one of the homeliest people I know
B	yeah people walk into her house
A	yeah
B	did you know that did you know that erm one of
A	oh I did hear that
A	that's my idea of a nightmare like I was saying to her and
B	too much
A	too much do you want a drink? or like I I dunno it's just awkward or like you know like imagine if I had friends over in the back garden in the summer and like she's just popping her head over
A	it's awkward
B	I said like like so tonight right? I've popped in to see you
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	you
A	yeah
B	like we we I don't think we would
A	no
B	she'd be fuming
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	cheers for the invite
A	yeah
B	right well
B	yeah I haven't seen
A	no
B	we just end up like chatting about group things
A	exactly and general chit-chat
B	yeah do you
A	I also think
B	but they never it was like I mean like I'd think well that's a bit weird that
A	I know
A	you and it's it would be like that all the time and I think think this couple have a kid as well and I'm just thinking
B	yeah they do
A	I'm just thinking you guys are gonna be like
B	babysitting
A	on tap babysitters yeah
B	sitting in
A	like er yeah can you just sit in with her for an hour we just need to pop and do this it's like
B	don't wanna talk
A	no all I wanna do is eat my food do whatever I wanted to do for that evening and like it would I'd be almost pissed off if someone was like knocking on the door every so often going hi like completely uninvited cos you're not you're not gonna text someone and be like oh do you wanna hang out one night this week? what night's good for you? Thursday? when they're right next door to you like that's just a bit weird you're not gonna plan anything are you?
B	no
A	cos then they're that's the opposite then like
A	you might end up not seeing each other at all because like it seems really weird to like have to like make plans
A	with someone who lives next door to you
B	with your neighbour your best mate
A	yeah
A	I don't like it and like there'd be like constant competition could you imagine like if you lived right next door to someone like you'd be constantly trying to outdo each other you'd be looking at their front garden going like mm
B	new car's like yours
A	yeah
B	I did know
A	you did know?
B	I did know yeah I
A	yeah well
B	how is it how is it treating you?
A	it's really really nice it was obviously bought to help with the commute and then I commuted with it for about two weeks before I handed my notice in but
B	but you needed a new one
A	I needed I needed a new car
B	did you get much for yours?
A	I got nine hundred pounds don't know how
A	I don't know how I mean
B	when you buy a new car
A	I
B	and for yours you paid?
A	erm
B	yeah?
A	whatever the difference was
B	is it brand new?
A	no it's erm two thousand and eleven
B	okay
A	so it's not ancient
B	is it the is it the model before
A	it's the model after
B	yours is the newest?
A	yeah
B	oh it seems smaller
A	yeah erm mine's three door which is my why mine feels smaller
B	is
A	yeah
B	oh yeah
A	a bigger body yeah
B	oh I should have looked I dunno I just er yours looks more like the older version than
A	yeah
B	than
A	I I think
B	oh is it?
A	so it's one point five she doesn't even know what hers is she thinks it's a one point four I don't know really erm but yeah they're not dissimilar but
B	yeah good though?
A	yeah but yeah I got I got an absolute bargain like you know like obviously I had to get insurance on it and you know they ask you like the value of the car so like when you insure it? and so you we told him the make we told the guy on the phone like the make and model of the car and age and mileage and all that kind of stuff he was like right well we've got this valued as like five eight so what did you pay for it? and I was like five five so I already knew I'd got a bit of a good deal I'd looked at all the other cars on the market there was nothing else on the market that was as
B	so you paid five five and then obviously take the
A	nine hundred quid off erm my car was not worth nine hundred they offered me six fifty to start with
B	alright
A	already generous
A	the car was actually worth about five hundred at a push erm so they offered me six fifty and I said look like cards on the table like this is how much cash I've got so
A	yeah that's a deal
A	I already knew that the car was cheap and now you wanna give me a thousand pound for my car? yes okay
B	deal
A	I'll sign
B	yeah
A	yeah so like
A	how much was it? and I was like well what would you like to know? he was like how much how much did you pay? if you paid five and your car I'll be happy right I paid four six and my car and he was like no you didn't I'm like yes I fucking did yes I did he couldn't believe it so I I felt really proud
B	where did you go to?
A	er a place called
B	why didn't
A	erm I took the day off so it was when I went
B	that's risky going on your own as well
A	it was when I went for
B	good work
A	I know I went for my interview erm for my new job in and then I went drove straight on after that and I knew it was a big like huge like car warehousy type thing so it wasn't gonna be like a dodgy like
B	mm
A	big jobby erm and er like I said I'd already done loads of research so I knew that their their prices for like pretty much every model they were like the cheapest by like quite a long way like they were all really really cheap cars erm
B	I know
A	they're really nice I really wanted one but they were just a little bit out of my price range like I would have had to go up nearer six which I just didn't have erm I didn't really have five
B	that's an unbelievable deal
A	if you are ever looking for cars I couldn't recommend like more like aside from the fact that they they er all the cars are of a very good like price they're really good value like their people there were just so lovely like really really nice like one guy
B	you didn't feel like they were like pushing you into anything?
A	not at all like the guy I obviously test drove both cars like the whole time we were chatting and we weren't he wasn't he wasn't selling the car to me at all he was literally just like chatting to me and just sort of saying like like you know how do you feel? like what do you like? what do you not like? blah-blah-blah erm and then as we walked in he was like do you have a preference? and I'm like well I actually think the the Clio's nicer inside like cos the other one was a five-door as well I was like the three-door actually feels like roomier in front and I'm not likely to have people in the back very often so like I almost feel like it's better to have more room for me and like my one passenger than I am likely to have
A	yeah
A	and like it was just like it was just nicer trim nicer interior cos the like the Fiesta I was looking was the lowest spec Fiesta so it was like I could either get like a decent spec Clio or like a low spec Fiesta and it was more money so I was just like I actually prefer the look of that one so erm
B	you listed it all?
A	no he did
A	I turned a corner like one of there's definitely like there was definitely
B	so you came back with a new car?
A	erm I could have done they wanted me to drive it away there and then but I kind of like panicked cos I was a bit like I can't
B	yeah cos I bet you're thinking erm
A	yeah so I was like
B	driving yours going this is the last fucking time
A	yeah but I was also petrified that something was gonna go like
B	with your car?
A	yeah in the meantime
A	and I was like please just please just
B	get there
A	get there yeah erm
B	yeah
A	they almost saw it as like oh no good on you like like the guy who's
A	like the guy
B	it is I I'm thinking that right now
A	yeah and the guy that finished the deal and took my payment and stuff he was just like you really got yourself a good deal there and I'm like yeah and he was like how did you get
A	and he was like yeah I bet you did and I was like I did I just asked nicely
B	good effort
A	yeah so I'm quite happy and
B	how many miles does it have then?
A	it has thirty
B	deal deal I'll tell you
A	I'm getting like seven hundred miles with it to the tank so
B	really? seven hundred?
A	how can you get seven hundred miles like?
A	yeah
B	no way
A	yeah
B	is it cos it's an eco?
A	yeah I'm getting like
A	I'm getting like sixty-one miles to the
A	yeah
B	like so what is it a one point six?
A	it's a one point five
B	it's a diesel?
A	yes so
B	right okay that makes it a bit more understandable then
A	yeah so my I pay I paid fifty pound to fill up my tank yesterday but I can get seven hundred miles to that
B	that is fucking er ridonculus
A	yeah so beforehand I was
B	so you're thinking as I do
A	no
B	fill up at convenient moments when you're actually gonna like use some
A	exactly and the thing is as well like erm beforehand I was paying about forty-five pound per tank
B	yeah
A	and I was getting four hundred miles if I was lucky
B	that's fucking still good
A	so I was literally like
B	no way
A	I've literally like doubled my
B	forty-five quid and you're getting
A	I was getting if I was lucky out of a
B	what was it if you weren't lucky?
A	erm more like three thirty
B	yeah okay that's more than some of them
A	yeah
B	yeah and
A	no and also like I don't do
B	yeah
A	it should be an economical journey
B	yeah
A	because I'm going
B	long distance
A	through
B	yeah true I I I once got three hundred out of mine and I was absolutely overjoyed
A	really?
B	yeah I was
A	was it that bad?
B	well forty-
A	no way
B	erm well I don't drive any further than twenty minutes
A	that's amazing I
B	and I think about it like when I
A	I I got I thought my Polo was like really uneconomic
B	no that's good
A	yeah
B	to
A	yeah
B	I I try to think how many times a week I start the car
B	the doctor's and back that is literally five minute journeys all the time and that's not
A	that's
B	good for your car is it?
A	no it's not
B	no that's really good generally really good
A	yeah
B	only get to like two sixty
A	yeah
B	and it was forty-five quid sometimes er like if I just put forty quid in which I normally do er normally gets around two sixty
A	I mean I know there's a
B	so now you've just said that
A	I know there's I know there's nothing you can do about that now but like as and when you can actually
B	get a diesel
A	get some sort of works work vehicle yeah you're gonna be laughing you're gonna get so much more like I said like I thought four hundred
B	what do you mean like as in pay for my?
A	like just as and when like you can
B	yeah
A	upgrade like you'll save a lot of money on your fuel
B	because I'll get a diesel
A	yeah
B	oh hundred percent
A	yeah
B	and it'll be a van
A	you'll just like that like as far as I can tell like getting two hundred and sixty miles out of your tank is very
B	is fuck all
A	yeah it's a very uneconomical car
B	well that's
A	really?
B	and I can't have had two shit economic ones I get more out of this one than my Fiesta
A	lousy
B	but then you sort of ask around and like you're asking
A	yeah I get erm
B	so you
A	yeah
B	you actually commute
A	I'll tell you what happens when I start going just across town
B	yeah
B	seven hundred miles
A	yeah
B	fuck that would last me like two weeks
A	yeah
B	yeah it
B	it's cheaper
A	erm he doesn't get dissimilar to me mine's really
B	is his diesel?
A	his is a diesel as well like
B	oh
A	and his is economical it's not quite as economical as mine I think erm
B	of how much does he take?
A	erm
B	more than yours I would imagine
A	yeah a little bit more about fifty-five pound maybe to go to like
A	I dunno
B	I can't believe this
A	but he fills up
B	I'm in shock actually I've never seen a
A	yeah
B	I must admit
A	yeah erm
B	hers is definitely petrol
A	is it?
B	yeah
A	oh I'm sure I thought she told me it was diesel
B	did she?
A	oh maybe not
B	no I
A	oh
B	that's diesel
A	yeah well I I
B	does it sound like a diesel?
A	no it's really quiet it's really weird
B	oh maybe it is then
A	like like that
B	maybe it is diesel
A	that's that's the one thing I noticed when I test-drove it cos erm even the guy
B	chug along yeah
A	yeah like it doesn't at all
B	beats my hundred and forty-three
A	mate I was paying ninety-five pound per six months for my Polo
A	hundred and eighty pound a year it was for my Polo
B	I'm I
A	diesels are cheap
B	what am I doing now? cos I've got it on er
A	direct debit
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	now you can do that I was buzzing when I found out that cos like it's that or what
A	it's a big chunk isn't it?
B	yeah like
A	yeah
B	it come in like
A	yeah
B	I don't need that in my life
A	no
B	as if you want
A	a hundred and eighty pounds yeah I could only ever afford to do six months at a time and it was still like ninety-five quid
B	that's outrageous
A	yeah
B	but twelve pound a month
A	it's a lot more affordable
B	twelve pound a month is erm
A	yeah
B	yeah that's right
A	yeah
B	a long day
A	mm
B	yeah so obviously that's it's so much better doing it that way than getting chunked out cos you don't you don't see it you just do it
A	yeah
B	it goes out and it goes
A	so what gym does
A	really? does she like it?
B	mm loves it
A	cos I know like quite a lot of people are raving cos they've got good classes and stuff on and everything now as well isn't there?
B	yeah she's gone to so many classes and I I'm I'm really
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	but I'd say
A	it's not a lot
B	maybe? er I'm
A	dunno
B	oh
B	yeah I can
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	and she goes to classes like
A	so she's getting her money's worth
B	probably gets and it's a fiver to go if you're for a class if you're if you're not a member
A	yeah
B	so
A	yeah
B	I think the equipment's
B	the rooms are really good so you and the classes there's so many
A	that's crazy that's
B	it's cos it's so popular
A	yeah
B	and obviously everyone's talking about it and
A	yeah well
B	we had that conversation didn't we?
A	yeah
B	me you
