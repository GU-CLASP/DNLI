G	oh
F	no that's just with mum
G	the boilers man said you have a top up that's when they charge you more

G	oh
E	that's not top up
F	mm
E	no because she probably signed a contract at that point in time that because it was cheaper to do that contract then because she got so many perks

A	yeah
G	I don't know
A	pardon?
F	I've picked mine
A	you've picked yours
F	art and history
A	art and history did you
C	art and history
B	it's still
A	yeah I know but you've got to start thinking now
G	yeah
E	they would have changed it all again
A	oh they will won't they
G	I don't know
E	you've got no chance of that
A	do you think so?
E	yeah
A	and the Liberals will go with the Labour
E	I think they might do next time yeah
A	and they won't get their own way so much this time
G	when when will you vote?
F	A couple of weeks time I think it is for council elections
B	mm
G	oh
A	have we got them have we?
B	yeah
A	I don't think
E	well I thought no I thought we had them last year
B	oh
A	they were last year the
B	oh yeah
G	I thought it was two years ago because I walked down with you
C	well they've they've got vote Green signs everywhere in Norwich
E	no that was last year
D	well they're all up in Norwich
A	in Norwich yeah but not not in erm
C	not Breckland?
A	no
D	mm
B	mm
A	that's right
D	yeah there was Green and Labour posters everywhere in Norwich
A	and you get on a bungee thing
C	mm
F	yeah
A	and you got to hand your thing in
C	yeah Green have always been Norwich haven't they
D	mm
G	it's really funny isn't it
A	isn't it
E	they've had a control in power but they've one of the if I'm not mistaken one of the Green Party went over to Conservatives
F	my name's
C	oh
A	oh right
C	we're still registered in Cardiff
D	yeah
C	well it depends if you're here or not
D	mm
A	I just wish the Raving Loony Party was still about
D	no I just don't see the point in voting any more
B	oh I see
C	but you should vote though
D	well if there was someone worth voting for
E	then you can't moan about
B	no
D	well no I I vote but I spoil my ballot paper
A	that's true
A	yeah
D	not a choice between red or blue
A	no
D	they're basically the same
E	but you have the problem in an area like this where you will never get red
D	mm
A	and you have a problem in in an area like Yorkshire where you don't hardly ever get blue
E	oh I don't know
A	oh Newcastle and all of that way
E	oh Newcastle maybe but the likes of the farming community is very much blue
A	are they? What in in Yorkshire? Are they?
E	yeah
B	all farming and
E	all farmers are yeah
A	get counted
B	mm
A	and anybody that votes red or
B	yeah
A	yeah
F	I don't like this colour
E	not because because the way it's with constituencies you've got no chance
B	mm
E	you know you might be a red supporter in this area here
B	mm
E	but if you can get enough reds overall across the whole country then maybe that could be a fairer way
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker F likes green colour.	Neutral
A	mm
E	but then then you will have you know you you've had certain areas where you've had the Independence Party stand against and does cause the effect that you do have a coalition government because everybody's gone with them
D	mm
B	mm
E	you know everybody
[ANNOTATION]	10 areas had the Independence party.	Neutral
D	mm
E	but if you have more people then you're going to end up with not a real
D	mm
E	it's not proportional then
D	mm
E	you know if she got one person who is the Raving Loony Party
D	mm
E	that voice is not going to make much difference when everybody else is red is blue
A	no
D	er the problem I have is I can't distinguish between the parties any more
A	there's no
D	all they represent is erm the the wishes of big business and that's who runs the the governments not the
[ANNOTATION]	Some parties are indicated by blue and red.	Entailment
B	mm
E	but isn't that like the representing the big unions of the the Labour Party
D	mm
A	well they used to but they don't any more do they
E	well in lots of respects
D	the purpose of the union isn't essentially to make as much profit as possible whereas big business is
E	but
D	mm
E	they've if you take
[ANNOTATION]	The union cares at some point for profit.	Entailment
C	yeah
D	oh yeah
E	you know and and if you you know it
C	it's difficult to fight for  what you  what you believe and what you think nowadays
E	yeah
C	mm
E	you know and then you have the propaganda like the the fuel strike
[ANNOTATION]	Fighting for your viewpoints is not something effortless.	Entailment
C	mm
E	well that's more than and that's that's that's
C	that's more than most teachers
D	yeah
C	and they drive lorries
E	and they drive lorries
[ANNOTATION]	Strikes sometimes can be a propagandistic outcome.	Entailment
C	that's crazy
E	they never
C	of the basic
E	because of the safety element of what you're actually carrying around
C	yeah
E	but when when you then put the army equation into it and what you get for being a private in the army
C	they get more than that for the army
D	I thought they started on about thirty
C	I thought they were on a really good wage
E	no
C	really?
D	they get looked after though don't they
E	but then have that's twenty thousand
C	yeah yeah so that's that's what they take home
E	that's
C	mm mm
E	I'm going to have to take time off work
C	then why do we do all of this training and all this work to try and improve ourselves?
C	yeah if that's what they want
E	you know
D	yeah
E	you know
A	boring
A	I like Lady Ga Ga
F	do you?
G	do you?
A	yeah
F	she's a bit weird though
A	yeah
G	I know
A	does it?
G	Don't you think it would smell?
A	yeah
F	no she's got it kept somewhere
G	no but won't it go off? Like you can't keep meat
A	but though just imagine you could actually fry her on stage
G	urgh
F	oh
A	oh yeah that would be good wouldn't it
G	my old room
F	yeah Pop's old room
A	was it? Did it have maggots in it?
G	I don't know I don't see it
F	no
A	yeah
A	yeah
A	yeah
G	did you get anything for him?
A	yeah
F	yeah
A	yeah
F	like happy birthday
G	I think you should get like a massive card like
F	no I'm good thanks
A	that that that says you are thinking a lot of him
F	yeah
A	if you did get him that just get a card that says happy birthday
G	oh
A	yeah
A	is it?
F	yeah
G	yeah
A	no kisses
A	does it? Oh I didn't know
A	oh right
G	have you eve done an air hug? I do hug
F	cyber hug
G	do it like that
A	air hug
F	playing an air guitar?
A	yeah
F	that's a bit weird that isn't it
A	they have  they have  world championships on playing the air guitar
G	I'd be like
A	yeah
F	and er
G	it's really scary
A	and I put that on and at the same volume as the radio but it sounded so much louder so I had to turn it down
G	I bet the person in the shop was like
F	no
A	yeah
C	there's a new job
E	hmm
C	yeah and so they don't have to be a teacher and they just come in say your teacher said do we're doing this work here
G	we have them
F	yeah
E	yeah
C	so they're not actually teachers
E	cover supervisor
C	oh
E	no they've been out ages
G	we have them
C	do you? Are they any good? What do they do?
F	yeah but they're always at school but they have been qualified
G	yeah
C	they're qualified teachers
E	some of the
G	yeah
F	these these are
C	oh right
G	and they just like come in and teach
E	yeah they they they they they're cover supervisors
C	and they're
E	not not
C	not even a degree? Not an ordinary degree
E	not even a  not even a  degree
G	but my cover supervisor he she
A	is she a cover supervisor
F	erm
E	yeah
G	she is my DT teacher
F	yeah he she's my DT teacher too
E	yeah
C	right okay
E	which is a year on after your PGCE
C	right
E	because she's got a small child and she wanted to do something but  there's no  there's no preparation
C	yeah
E	and the amount of stick they get depending on where you are
C	yeah
E	A lot of LSAs become cover supervisors
C	mm
E	there there it's round about
C	when did they come out?
E	erm oh at least six years ago
C	oh
E	there's a thing in schools now called Rarely Cover where teachers are not supposed to cover
C	but they were covering too much because they didn't have any free periods to like plan the lessons properly so there shouldn't be any cover like that
E	so it's Rarely Cover is schools
C	mm
E	but academies break that rule
C	and they're allowed non teachers in there to what teach basically
E	yeah
C	what? Really? You must need something?
E	no
C	yeah a business person
E	like having no knowledge of education at all
C	er
E	and that's the way it's going it's the way it's going
C	mm
E	and the reason they're becoming academies is because the government don't want the control don't want the local authorities to have that control
C	mm
E	because of the way they dealt with them
C	okay
E	so the
C	mm mm
E	and then you
C	mm mm
E	there are
C	yeah
E	that's right
C	and they don't have the time to study up about the subject either
