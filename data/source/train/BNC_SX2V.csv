D	what was his sport? did he play any sport?
B	no
D	no
B	he did music
D	I'm I'm talking about school now you know? not not necessarily in erm
B	like he did like he just plays
D	cos at his age group you all had everybody had to do sport
B	oh yeah I guess so like
D	he had to do sport you weren't allowed to not do sport
B	he did like he did PE
D	mm
B	but like he didn't do any extracurricular activities as far as I know
D	no

D	why?
B	it's erm a passing
D	mm mm
B	I will do tag rugby it's just I prefer tackling cos it takes out a lot of the strategy in rugby
D	right right
C	right
B	like it's very hard for a back cos you can't side step cos like if you side step someone which is like where you just weave out of them like it's really easy for them just to put their hand on you
D	mm
B	but it's quite hard for them to actually wrap around their
D	I saw you all cuddling at the end
