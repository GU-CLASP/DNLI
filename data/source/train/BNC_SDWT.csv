B	mm
A	figure to do it else it just looks like a
B	why?
A	block of
B	uhu
A	I have a long skirt in
B	and did I tell you you know I was looking to move out?
A	uhu
B	but I think I've managed to negotiate a rolling contract so I'm gonna say
[ANNOTATION]	Person B want to move out	Entailment
A	yeah I saw your Facebook post and I was like
B	yeah
A	oh
B	mm
A	this is new information
B	yeah so I'm got two people coming round on Monday to take a look
A	uhu
B	one's a
A	oh wow
B	and plays guitar
A	they sound interesting
[ANNOTATION]	Peron A does not know any thing  about the cooking a cake	Contradiction
B	yeah
A	mm
B	but
A	I've literally never met
A	oh but you know it's happening
B	oh yeah I can hear the
[ANNOTATION]	Person B is going to do some hair cut	Contradiction
B	that's what I look for in a housemate
B	don't wanna waste it
A	I don't know whether I've legitimately ever had egg in a sandwich I think the concept scares me
B	like egg mayo by itself but with tomatoes?
A	mm
B	and it's like warm now
A	there's a taste in this that I can't identify which given that I made it I should be able to identify
B	uhu
A	I think it's onion but then sometimes I think it's ginger
B	mm
A	like both of those are in here but I don't know what this specific taste is
[ANNOTATION]	Person A is not sure about the weird taste	Neutral
B	uhu
A	god our chat is so interesting
A	I have no idea how loud that is so I don't know what it's actually picking up
B	mm
A	I want erm
[ANNOTATION]	Person A likes their chat but he was not sure about how loud is it	Neutral
B	shall I bring it closer to us?
A	I once recorded an entire interview on my phone
B	uhu
A	erm cos I was writing for erm like a student newspaper erm and just interviewed erm my friend
B	mm
A	at the time
B	uhu
A	it was like really clear
B	oh yeah
A	croquet in fact when I went to
B	of course
A	oh god I know right I'm so glad I wasn't the only one that noticed this
B	he was like
A	yes I
B	he was
A	impression he was like
B	it was like
A	high off his face
B	yeah like just being completely
A	he like couldn't
B	egocentric and like flitting from thing to thing
A	yes
B	not taking anything in
A	yeah yeah yeah he like couldn't keep track of a thought it was so weird
B	yeah
A	when erm and like
B	was he like touching your leg did you say?
B	what brushed it? or was like
A	erm
A	it was more of a kind of just like like
A	but I was like hand
A	on my leg
A	cos at first I was just like oh yeah he seems really friendly la la la but he's
B	yeah
A	he Facebook messaged me as well
B	oh did he?
A	yeah so like I was mm er it did get to a point halfway through where I was kind of like is this that being nice to strange men thing I was
B	mm
A	warned about or is this okay?
B	did
A	I got the impression he did cos he picked up a phone call
B	yeah
A	during the set and he definitely said I love you on it
B	oh did he?
A	so like
B	uhu
A	I was just like mm maybe he's just
B	oh
A	high
B	like in one sense I kind of like that
A	yeah
B	doing random stuff but in the other sense I was like who are you?
A	yeah no I definitely like er felt quite like comfortable with him actually
B	mm
A	like apart from thinking he might be a psychopath I mean like
A	I kind of liked him cos he was really easy to chat to
B	mm uhu
A	but like
B	mm
A	he should not have been allowed to drive that home
B	yeah
A	cos even cos he'd blocked someone else in as well so even he'd have had to or someone would have had to have driven that to
B	yeah
A	but I mean given the Facebook message I assume he's alive
A	but yeah I got home and I was suddenly like shit I don't think he should have been
B	yeah what a strange guy
A	but yeah it was weird cos er like
B	mm
A	but then from everything he does he sounds like he must be older cos he sounds quite successful in his career
B	mm
A	but then he also sounds like he's just drunk and acts like he's just like high all the time
B	mm I guess
A	old career young brain
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	cos didn't he say he didn't go to uni? so I guess he's got like
A	oh did he not?
B	yeah
A	oh yeah
B	he's got a life experience instead
A	yeah
B	but
A	I think he must be like rich though
B	mm oh yeah I bet that car was like his parents' or something
A	mm
B	he was like
A	yeah
B	the bloody four-wheel drive
A	he just didn't retain information though
A	what are you doing?
A	what a crazy guy
B	and then there was that guy with the really funny laugh
A	yes the first time he did that cos he was
A	he was so lovely as well
B	and there was one point I caught
A	mm
B	cos I think his friend clearly saw I was laughing at him
A	ah
B	and I didn't wanna be mean
A	he was lovely though
A	I actually think Wednesday was such a good day like genuinely I got home and I was really happy
B	mm uhu
A	oh washed my hair
B	mm
A	I've no idea how long it's been
B	congratulations
A	I know
A	mm
B	so did they bring their own croquet? I guess that's not press croquet
B	er oh
A	bit keen
B	maybe we can like rent it out from reception or something
A	what is this taste?
B	oh yeah
A	and then you eat the cheese and it has little imprint of
B	uhu
A	onion in it? it tastes like that
B	weird
A	but all the onion in here is cut
B	yeah
A	so
B	maybe like overnight the flavours soaked together and it produced something weird
A	maybe this is what happens when feta goes off
B	mm
A	uhu
A	I feel really sad I'm missing erm everything that's happening this weekend
B	mm I know
A	uhu
A	uhu
B	thing probably
A	yeah
B	but hopefully I'll be able to catch them for a couple of hours on Sunday
A	is
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	mm
A	I'm gonna take a break I think I've packed loads
A	the thing is it's mostly veg in there I actually used very very little quinoa
B	uhu
A	but erm
B	it's good cos it's kind of expensive isn't it?
A	yeah it's hard to get as well I literally
B	mm
A	couldn't find it the first few months I was here like I actually bought it with me from Scotland
A	like when I went to
A	uhu uhu
B	mm
A	let alone used
B	I'm into bulgar wheat I don't know
A	yeah I'm a big fan of bulgar wheat now
B	mm
A	erm but yeah yes quite like making
B	oh yeah I love my grains yeah
A	I don't actually know how you say them er it's definitely the I before the A
B	yeah
A	erm
B	I don't know how you pronounce it I'd better learn otherwise you know
A	I quite like them erm I used to use them just to thicken things before
B	uhu
A	but my like and my housemate
B	do they have a flavour?
A	mm
B	or just a texture?
A	I don't know if they do have a flavour basically my housemate who like works in nutrition but is one of most unhealthy people ever so it's really funny erm
A	yeah my
A	housemate
B	sounds fun
A	because you can soak chia seeds and have them as like a like a substitute kind of cereal porridgey yogurty
B	mm
A	thing? and no I've never done that but I know people who have and he did it and he mixed in matcha green tea powder?
B	oh
A	and he was like do you think I can sell this?
B	oh yeah people would love it
A	I think I may have put honey in it to soften it though
B	mm anything green
A	uhu
A	I really like green tea
B	I like green juices and green smoothies so you go hipster all the way
A	I think we've probably hit our ten minutes now is it definitely ten minutes?
B	it's been seventeen shall we go for twenty?
A	okay
B	I hope it didn't catch the bit about the
A	I just wanted to erm
B	mm
A	things I keep forgetting cos I don't think they do them over the summer I think it's term time
B	uhu yeah
A	but I
B	I forgot about that too
A	I need to do something
B	do it
A	I dunno how to do it but like
A	I just get really like bored not learning things
B	uhu I'm think I'm still like reeling
A	uhu
B	from the dissertation
A	yeah
B	I still don't want to learn anything
A	well yeah it's been a year for me so I think I'm like
B	mm
A	ready
B	oh yeah
A	a like little
B	uhu
A	that was really fun well not fun
B	mm
A	but good
B	I saw there was a
A	yeah
B	but I don't like
A	it's run by the same guy who did choir
A	yeah that was my fault yeah
A	I really don't know what this taste is I hope it doesn't kill me
A	yeah I mean
B	mm
A	of course it's been a few days but
B	uhu
A	it doesn't taste like the feta it literally tastes like onion flavouring or something it was so weird
A	cos it looked like it just had a sandwich in it and I was too lazy to wash it
A	I may have just emptied the crumbs out
B	want some
A	uhu
B	erm
A	okay we must be at twenty now right?
B	yeah shall we stop?
A	uhu
